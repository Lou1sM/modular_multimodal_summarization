        "Marah, Michelle and Marina have walked into the trap Carrie has so carefully laid in the funhouse. Carrie has a gun aimed at Marah but Josh saves her. Buzz and Alan think they spot Carrie, rather than just a reflection of her, and dive for her. Michelle, under the influence of the drugs, winds up in Carrie's sight but Ed saves her at the last moment. They find a trap door that leads down to a dangerous torrent of running water. Ed then finds an opening in the wall that leads outside to the fairgrounds where he strands Michelle and Marina for their own safety. Carrie turns on a flickering light that makes it impossible to see. Marah gets separated from Josh and, while searching for her frantically, gets a hold of Carrie's location. Buzz, carrying his gun, also spots Carrie, but she gets off the first shot and wounds him. Josh dives for her and they struggle for the gun. A shot is fired and Carrie slumps, mortally wounded. Reva, is fighting a series of odd sensations she's been having since the night began and she's unable to put together the pieces and understand what they add up to. It all makes her uneasy and finally she tries to call Marah, only to get her machine at home. Gus visits Phillip and tries to question him about the missing shipments of Antimonies. But Phillip's too fatigued to be of much help. Olivia arrives and tries to kick Gus out but he warns her that he's not going to let her push him around. Olivia is angry but can do little about it. She presents Phillip with some papers to sign and he's surprised to see they're an addendum to his will. Olivia downplays the significance of the timing, and asserts that it's important for any children they may have. Phillip agrees and signs the papers."

        "Phillip: Gus?",
        "Gus: How are you doing, Phillip? Waking up from a little nap?",
        "Phillip: Yeah. What are you doing here?",
        "Gus: Can't a guy come visit his brother? All right, well, yeah, you got me. I'm here because I got that message about the Antimonious. Spaulding Pharmaceuticals' number one best seller?",
        "Phillip: (Moans)",
        "Gus: It's all right. It's okay. You're still waking up. I get it. I can come back later if you'd like.",
        "Phillip: Okay.",
        "Gus: All right, look, here's the thing: I got your message from Rick, okay? That you wanted to talk to me about Antimonious, and that was great, because I really needed to talk to you about it. See, the stuff is going missing in shipments, in transit, all over the place. And I want to know who that affects and what that affects. Am I going to quick for you?",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm.",
        "Gus: All right, it's just... Phillip, I could really use your help in clearing this thing up, you know? No, I need your help to clear this thing up, so why don't you just take your time, you know? And try to open up with me now, okay? Because there's no one here but us chickens.",
        "Olivia: Thanks for getting this done so quickly.",
        "Man: We really should take a little bit more time to just go into...",
        "Olivia: You know what? That won't be necessary.",
        "Man: But I think that...",
        "Olivia: You know what? I have to get back to my husband. But thank you for getting this done so quickly. I'll be in touch.",
        "(Dials phone)",
        "Rick: Gus, two words, buddy. Poker game. It's the Rickmeister. Listen, I need somebody to, you know, beat in poker, and you happen to be the guy. So when you get this message, give me a call or... You know what? Tell you what. Better yet, don't give me a call. Just come on by, all right? And listen, don't take this the wrong way, all right? Don't bring Harley. Okay, the last time I played cards with Harley, she cleaned me out, okay? So I repeat: Do not bring Harley.",
        "(Hangs up phone)",
        "Rick: Okay. All right. Okay, we got the beer, pop, chips, dip. Where's the dip? Dip, pizza. Well, Rick, everybody's an hour late, so if you want to eat three pizzas, go ahead and order the pizzas. This is pathetic. I mean, this could turn out to be a game of solitaire. What's the world coming to when I can't find enough friends to play poker? This is pathetic. I mean, I'm pathetic. There's got to be at least one friend out there who's pathetic as I am. This is ridiculous. Oh, Frank.",
        "Frank: Hey, Doc.",
        "Rick: Oh, man, I was really starting to get desperate.",
        "Frank: What do you mean, desperate? Come on, here.",
        "Rick: What?",
        "Frank: We got chips, we got pretzels, we got dip, and we got beer.",
        "Rick: Well, that's great. You, Bill, and I can eat ourselves into a salt coma. Frank, it's just going to be the three of us. That's it.",
        "Frank: What are you talking about? You drag me away from Darci, and we don't even have a game?",
        "Rick: When opportunity presents itself, Frank, you've got to grab it, and that's what I'm doing tonight. I want to have fun.",
        "Frank: Look at you. You look like a teenager whose parents just went out for the night.",
        "Rick: Well, you're right. And it's true, unfortunately. Mel's out having dinner with her folks, and my dad is... I don't know where he is. He's out. Thankfully, he's out. He was able to pick himself up and get himself out of here. Frank, I tell you, I'm worried about him. He's starting to turn into a recluse.",
        "Frank: What's the matter with you? I told you not to worry about that anymore. He's a big boy. He's going to be fine.",
        "Bill: Yeah. Hey, hey, hey. What's going on, guys? I didn't come empty-handed.",
        "Rick: Bill, I'm sorry. I should have given you a call and saved you the trip. We don't... It doesn't look like we're going to have enough guys to play tonight.",
        "Bill: What are you talking about? Not to worry, not to worry. I brought recruits. Hey, guys, come on. What's taking so long?",
        "Shayne: Hey.",
        "Frank: Fellas.",
        "Sandy: Hey, guys.",
        "Rick: (Clears throat)",
        "Cassie: Reva? Hey.",
        "Reva: Hi, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: What are you doing? Whoa. Is that a ring?",
        "Reva: Yeah. Actually, it's a ring I saw the other night at the Valentine's Day Dance. Some strange woman was wearing it. She wanted to dance with Josh.",
        "Cassie: Did he give it to her?",
        "Reva: The ring?",
        "Cassie: The dance.",
        "Reva: Oh, yeah.",
        "Cassie: Now you're obsessed with her ring?",
        "Reva: No, no. It's just that I saw it again a few minutes ago.",
        "Cassie: Here?",
        "Reva: Here, but not really here. It was more like a vision. Anyway, I didn't want to forget what it looked like, so I started drawing it.",
        "Cassie: Why do you care so much?",
        "Reva: I wish I knew.",
        "Josh: Marah, can you hear me? Get out of here right now! Right now!",
        "Marah: Dad?",
        "Marina: Marah, where's your dad?",
        "Michelle: Wait, why would Josh be here? What? Where's Carrie?",
        "Marina: You guys, I'm dizzy. Are you dizzy?",
        "Josh: Marah? Marah, here. I got you. Marina, come here.",
        "Marina: Hey.",
        "Josh: Let's get out of here.",
        "Billy: Well, let's get you girls out of here. Come on.",
        "Carrie: Not until you've paid the piper. A life for a life. I wouldn't do that, Buzz. I'm a very good shot. Well, step right up, ladies and gentlemen. Step right up.",
        "Buzz: You're sick.",
        "Carrie: Yes, I'm sick, but I'm also very impatient. Ante up, gentlemen. Ante up.",
        "Ed: Look, you're angry at us, not our daughters. Just let them go.",
        "Carrie: And then you would never know what it's like to lose someone you love, someone young, someone innocent.",
        "Billy: Buzz, right there!",
        "Josh: Okay. All right, here's the deal. We split up. We've got to find an exit out of here. Okay, let's go.",
        "Billy: Good.",
        "Buzz: All right, let's find her.",
        "Marah: I'm sorry.",
        "Josh: Don't be sorry, darling. This was our mistake. It wasn't yours.",
        "Billy: Yeah, we're going to get you out of here. Don't worry. Come on, let's just keep on going.",
        "Reva: Oh, forget it. It's just a ring.",
        "Cassie: Okay, well, why don't you tell me more about the woman? Then maybe we can figure out what the vision meant.",
        "Reva: I've never seen her before. But she wanted to cut in for a dance with Josh, and then Alexandra told me that she wanted to dance with Buzz, too.",
        "Cassie: Well, sounds she was making the rounds. Okay, well, I don't know, I think I would be pretty annoyed if some young hot thing tried to cut in on my man.",
        "Reva: No, no. It wasn't like that. She's an older woman, but she's very refined.",
        "Cassie: High-society type? Overaccessorized?",
        "Reva: No, it was just this one ring. But... I don't know, apparently it's been in the family for awhile. She something about it being from Venice.",
        "Cassie: Well, there you go. It's an old ring. It has history to it. I mean, that's probably why you're getting all the vibes. I mean, imagine how the original owner got it. I mean, she was probably on a gondola ride gliding down the canal with Romeo.",
        "Reva: You've been practicing Tammy's lines with her a little too much.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, you're probably right. The other day, I used \"thou\" in a sentence. I mean, what is that?",
        "Reva: You know, it's just the feelings seem so recent.",
        "Cassie: Reva?",
        "Reva: You know, it's... There are feelings that I've been having for the past few days, and it's just that they feel very now. And I can't seem to figure out what in the world they have to do with me.",
        "Shayne: Guy's night out. This is so great.",
        "Bill: Going to take these guys out. Teach them what it's all about. They're spending too much time with the women.",
        "Sandy: And that is a bad thing?",
        "Rick: Well, yes and no. Listen, guys, before we start our poker game tonight, I just want to congratulate Shayne and Sandy, guys. Congratulations. You're our new Beer Fetchers.",
        "Bill: Oh, yeah.",
        "Rick: Yes, yes.",
        "Frank: What is a Beer Fetcher, Rick?",
        "Rick: I'll tell you. It brings us to Rule Number One, which basically says, as the youngest guys at the table, it's your responsibility, it's your duty to make that the senior members of this game tonight are never thirsty. Never.",
        "Shayne: And what do we get out of this?",
        "Frank: That would be all the sodas and water you could drink.",
        "Bill: Yee-haw! And I've never been happier to lose a job. And I got two designated drivers. What a night it's going to be. What's wrong with this? Dr. Rick, could you help me out here?",
        "Rick: It's empty.",
        "Bill: I don't know. Somebody needs to... Could you tell me what's missing?",
        "Rick: I don't know what you need yet.",
        "Bill: Tell me what's missing in my life.",
        "(Drink pouring)",
        "Frank: There we go.",
        "Bill: Oh, we've got to get you back on the mount.",
        "Frank: All right, fellas, let's be seated. Let's start this. So, Shayne?",
        "Shayne: Yeah.",
        "Frank: What is my beautiful daughter doing tonight?",
        "Shayne: I think she's... she's doing some kind of girls night out thing. And I'm pretty sure she's with Marah and Michelle.",
        "Rick: Okay, guys, no more girlie-girl talk. I mean, do we need a count for all the women in our lives here? We're men. All right, we're men who want to play poker.",
        "Bill: Yeah, let's go.",
        "Rick: So let's not waste anymore time. Let's get down to it. If my dad and my wife show up, I'll send you on home. By the way, if my wife sees all this junk food, Frank, she'll send you guys all home.",
        "Frank: Don't worry about it. So, Sandy, this island that you grew up on, I mean, card playing, was that a big thing there?",
        "Sandy: Not really. It's been a while since I've played.",
        "Shayne: You know, I've never once in my life played poker.",
        "Rick: All right.",
        "Frank: You what?",
        "Rick: Yeah, Shayne never plays poker? Please, give me a break.",
        "Bill: No, it's sad. It's sad, isn't it? But don't worry. We're going to teach you.",
        "Frank: Get some chips. Get some chips, man.",
        "Shayne: Too bad my mom's not here. My dad said she's a real card shark.",
        "Rick: Okay, that brings us to Rule Number Two, Shayne, and that is, no women allowed. Okay, they're cute and they're enticing, but they leave you at the table in nothing but your boxer shorts, broke. Right?",
        "Frank: Yeah. Trust me. He knows what he's talking about.",
        "(Laughter)",
        "Bill: I tell you what: Why don't we play a few hands and let Shayne watch and learn?",
        "Shayne: All right.",
        "Bill: Better yet, I tell you what: I'll teach you all how to play Texas Hold 'Em. Then you will be on equal ground.",
        "Frank: Texas what?",
        "Bill: Hold 'Em.",
        "Rick: Oh, Texas Hold 'Em. That's a real masculine game.",
        "Bill: Come on now.",
        "Rick: No, no. No, no, Bill, we're playing Five-Card Stud.",
        "Bill: All right.",
        "Rick: All right. And don't worry, Shayne, you'll learn as you go along.",
        "Shayne: Thanks.",
        "Rick: Okay? No problem.",
        "Sandy: Stick with me, Shayne. I'll beat you.",
        "Shayne: Oh, thanks, Brother.",
        "Sandy: That's what brothers are for. And as I've said, I haven't played in a while, but it'll come back to me.",
        "Phillip: I'm sorry, Gus. I just can't remember. I think...",
        "Gus: Philip, it's just that this drug, the name Antimonious, it keeps popping up all over the place.",
        "Phillip: (Stammering)",
        "Gus: Did you talk to anybody about it? Alan?",
        "Phillip: Yeah, Alan. Maybe... I'm not sure.",
        "Gus: Maybe Alexandra.",
        "Phillip: I don't know. Could have been...",
        "Gus: Brad Green?",
        "Phillip: Maybe. If there was a report...",
        "Gus: Report. What kind of report?",
        "Phillip: Yeah. No, I don't... I'm not... If there was... He gets reports. Green... (Mumbling)",
        "Gus: A lot of... a lot of people get reports.",
        "Phillip: Sub! Sub-corporations. That was... Yeah.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Phillip: I had questions... I had questions about sub-corporations. I remember.",
        "Gus: Okay, anything else?",
        "Phillip: Umm.... no.",
        "Gus: All right, look, that's good. That helped me. Don't worry about it. That's good.",
        "Phillip: I remember that.",
        "Gus: Yeah, that's good.",
        "Phillip: I remember I had questions about sub-corporations.",
        "Gus: I just... I just want you to know I got your back at Spaulding, okay? I got your back and I got Alan's back, and that is a promise, okay?",
        "Olivia: Well, look who's here after visiting hours.",
        "Gus: Just hanging out with my brother, Phillip.",
        "Olivia: That's nice. That's nice. Hello, sweetheart. Gus, can I steal you away for just a minute? Who do you think you are?",
        "Gus: I'm his brother.",
        "Olivia: And I'm his wife. Maybe you missed the memo.",
        "Gus: I don't get those memos.",
        "Olivia: I made out strict rules regarding access to Phillip.",
        "Gus: What was that? \"Access?\"",
        "Olivia: He isn't interested in being with anybody but his family right now.",
        "Gus: I am his family, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: No, I mean me, me -- family, me. So why don't you leave quietly and do us all a bit of good?",
        "Gus: Do you give that speech a lot? Because that might work with Alexandra, maybe even Alan. But it ain't going to work with me. So I will come and see my brother when I want to, and how I want to. And the last person on earth whose permission I will ask for is yours. Olivia, I know what you're all about, and I've known for a very long time, okay? So the last person you want to make an enemy out of is me.",
        "Bill: Well, I'll tell you, we've been here an hour, and we haven't talked about the upcoming election.",
        "Rick: That's because we're not going to talk about it, Bill.",
        "Bill: Oh, come on.",
        "Frank: I don't mind talking about the upcoming election.",
        "Bill: What? What? What?",
        "Frank: No, offense, Bill, but I really don't like the idea of Danny Santos running this town, especially when he's up against Ross Marler, who's a very good man. As matter of fact, I really hope that Ross beats Danny.",
        "Bill: Oh, well, Frank, I'm glad Danny's not here to listen to this.",
        "Frank: Well, that makes two of us.",
        "Bill: Well, we'll just see what happens come Election Day.",
        "Frank: I guess. You know what? I'm going to check in with the station real quick.",
        "Bill: (Laughs)",
        "Rick: Rule Number Three, guys.",
        "Frank: Where's the phone?",
        "Rick: It's over here.",
        "Frank: Thanks.",
        "Rick: No talking about politics about my card table.",
        "Bill: Okay.",
        "Shayne: I got it. I think I'm ready to play some cards.",
        "Rick: All right.",
        "Frank: Okay. All right, that's great. Thank you.",
        "Bill: All quiet on the western front, Chief?",
        "Frank: So far, so good. Looks like it's going to be an uneventful night.",
        "Marah: (Panting)",
        "Josh: Marah, darling, we have to keep moving. We're almost there. Come on, darling, let's go. Come on, sweetie. Come on, we're going to get out of here.",
        "Ed: No. Girls, look, we've got to keep going. We have to keep going.",
        "Marina: No, wait. Wait, wait. Where is my grandpa? Okay, I need to find...",
        "Ed: Honey, he knows what he's doing. He knows what he's doing. Come on, we've got to crawl. Turn around and crawl. Let's go.",
        "Carrie: A tisket, a tasket, which girl will get the basket? Dead end.",
        "Josh: No! (Gunfire)",
        "Ed: All right, come on. Let's go. Let's go. We can't stay here.",
        "Marina: Oh, my God, where is she?",
        "Ed: I don't know. I don't know. But listen to me. She knows where we are, so we can't stay here. Now, we've got to move, all right? Go out this way. Come on. Let's go. No, this way. This way.",
        "Olivia: Fine, Gus. You're right. I mean, you are Phillip's brother, and for reasons beyond my comprehension, he seems to have been pleased to see you. So I'll make an exception in your case.",
        "Gus: Wow, thank you so much for your kindness.",
        "Olivia: I just want you to know where I'm coming from.",
        "Gus: Oh, I know where you're coming from, Olivia. That's a place I never want to visit.",
        "Olivia: Look, all I'm asking is that you just give me a little notice before you pop in on Phillip.",
        "Gus: I don't think you're getting it. Honey, you've got no power over me, okay? So no, I don't have to give you any notice. No, I don't have to give you a phone call. I don't have to give you the time of day. So just keep doing what you're doing. Show up at Spaulding Boardroom meetings unannounced, waving your proxy all over the damn place, okay? And maybe it'll get you somewhere in that room. But it'll get you nowhere with me.",
        "Olivia: I think what you need to understand as well as the board is that I'm his wife. I'm looking out for his interests.",
        "Gus: Uh-huh. That's good. That makes two of us. Look, I'm done visiting Phillip for the day, because I don't want to push him anymore. But tell him... tell him I'll be back to see him real soon, okay? And no, I won't be giving you any notice as to when that will be.",
        "Olivia: Hey, you.",
        "Phillip: Where's Gus?",
        "Olivia: He didn't want to tire you out. I told him he could stay as long as he wanted, but he had someplace else to be. I don't want to tire you out either, but I have some papers for you to sign.",
        "Phillip: More papers?",
        "Olivia: Yeah, from the Spaulding lawyers. Just take a minute.",
        "Phillip: I already gave you my proxy. You can sign anything in my name.",
        "Olivia: Anything except this.",
        "Phillip: Is this my will?",
        "Frank: I don't want to look at these again. Oh, great. I'm out.",
        "Rick: Lay them down, guys, lay them down. Let's go. Come on.",
        "Sandy: Pair of Threes.",
        "Rick: Pair of Threes do not beat a Full House.",
        "Sandy: Rick.",
        "Frank: Cheer up, Rick.",
        "Sandy: Yes, it's taking me a while to warm up.",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, I'm right behind you.",
        "Rick: The doctor is still in. And you know what? You guys are so fun, we need to make this a regular thing, really.",
        "Bill: Is that right? You finally found a group that you can beat.",
        "Rick: Exactly. I tell you, Phillip would be very proud of me, wouldn't he?",
        "Frank: Yep, he would.",
        "Shayne: At least Sandy here is getting himself a nice Springfield history lesson today.",
        "Sandy: True. I am learning a lot as I lose my shirt. Is this what you guys did when you were younger, lose your shirt to your dads on poker night?",
        "Rick: Our dads? Frank, can you even picture our dads sitting around a poker table?",
        "Frank: No. No. You see, the guys, they all knew each other, but no one really hung out together. What about you, man? You haven't said anything about yourself.",
        "Shayne: Well, you didn't let the guy get a word in edgewise.",
        "Rick: Well, that's all right. I mean, you know, Sandy, if you make this a regular thing, keep giving me money like this, we'll know more about Sandy than we ever cared to know about Sandy, right? I mean, it's hard to leave a secret in this town, isn't it?",
        "Frank: Absolutely.",
        "Rick: Well, you know what? Maybe we could change all that. Billy Boy, why don't you hand him the deck?",
        "Bill: Oh, yeah?",
        "Rick: Yeah. Yeah. Why don't you... why don't you deal? Maybe it'll change your luck. You do know how to deal, right?",
        "Bill: If not, you can get us another round of beers.",
        "Sandy: Oh, no. It's cool. I can deal.",

        "Bill: Yeah, come on. We'll take it easy on you.",
        "Sandy: Hey, why don't we play some... I don't know, Seven-Card Stud, deuces wild? You want to cut? Or I can take care of that. So fellows, ante up. Let's roll.",
        "Bill: This is going to be interesting.",
        "Sandy: Third Street. You're high. Your bet.",
        "Cassie: Anything new out there?",
        "Reva: Same old patio, same old lawn.",
        "Cassie: How can I help?",
        "Reva: You can help by talking about something else. How's Tammy's play going? Or Edmund. Edmund and the consulate.",
        "Cassie: Okay, now. I know you're really weird if you want to hear about Edmund Winslow.",
        "Reva: See? I'm desperate.",
        "Cassie: Come on. You know that you guys are getting along a little.",
        "Reva: I'm still having a really hard time seeing the two of you together, but I am trying.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Enough about me. What about you?",
        "Reva: What about me? Oh. He was here earlier for Game Night with the kids.",
        "Cassie: You guys still do Game Night?",
        "Reva: Well, we haven't done it in a long time, but then he had to cut it short, because he had to go and be with Billy.",
        "Cassie: Those wild and crazy Lewis Boys.",
        "Reva: Yeah. Well, anyway, I'm feeling really good about the way things are with Josh and me. I mean, better than I've felt in a long time.",
        "Cassie: Okay. But?",
        "Reva: There's something going on with him. I don't know what it is. He's just... he's been quiet, and... I don't know. Maybe that's where he went tonight, to get all that resolved. At least I hope so.",

        "(Phone rings)",
        "Cassie: Hello? Tammy? What's up? Again? All right. No, no, no. It's okay, babe. I'll be there. Okay. Yep. Bye. I am a part of the worst carpool. My gosh. I'm sorry. I have to go pick up Tammy.",
        "Reva: No, go. Don't let her wait.",
        "Cassie: Oh, come on, come on. Why don't you come with me? She would love to see you.",

        "Cassie: Are you talking to me? We don't chat, Gus, so I don't... You don't know how I do what? This is probably why we don't chat. I mean, Harley may understand you, but I have no idea what you're...",
        "Gus: I'm just saying, how do you do it? How do you do it? How do you put up with that partner of yours, Olivia?",
        "Cassie: What about her?",
        "Gus: What about her? She's impossible.",
        "Cassie: No, she's not impossible. She's just unique.",
        "Gus: Oh, unique. Yeah, she's... she just read me the Riot Act for trying to visit my own brother. She acts like she's got the exclusive rights to everything Spaulding. I... I know. I know what you're thinking. I should be nice to her, because she lost the... I mean, I'm sorry, you know? But I know that you... Harley told me about that with you, like, a couple... I'll shut up.",
        "Cassie: That's okay. I just don't want to talk about it.",
        "Gus: No, of course. I don't blame, you. You'll talk about it with, like, a girlfriend, like Olivia. You guys are kind of friends, right?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, we are.",
        "Gus: Yeah. Yeah. So what do you think?",
        "Cassie: Okay. What do I think about what?",
        "Gus: What do you think about what... Why do you think she's doing it? I mean, it's got to be affecting you more than it's affecting just about anybody, right? You got the brunt. You're bearing the brunt. You're, like, running this hotel all by yourself. I don't see her trying to help you out. Why? Because she's too busy making plans -- shotgun weddings and interjecting at Spaulding Boardroom meetings where she really doesn't belong.",
        "Cassie: She's Phillip's wife, and she's looking out for his best interests.",
        "Gus: Yeah, that's how she put it.",
        "Cassie: Well, there you go.",
        "Gus: No, I mean, that's exactly how she put it.",
        "Cassie: So?",
        "Gus: Well, that just means that you've obviously discussed this before, which means you have asked her what her motives were, just like I have.",
        "Olivia: It's not really a will. It's an addendum to the one you already have. I just thought that now that we're married it's an important thing to do.",
        "Phillip: Right now?",
        "Olivia: Well, I already signed the addendum to mine. So?",
        "Phillip: I'm too tired to read it right now. Could it wait until later?",
        "Olivia: It could, yeah. Or I could read it to you, and you could sign it. It's for our children.",

        "Olivia: But we have a long life...",
        "Phillip: Our little girl died.",
        "Olivia: We have a long life ahead of us, and I think we both know how we feel about trying again. This wi... addendum is really... it's not for me. It's for the children we're going to have together. It'll set them up for life.",
        "Phillip: Well, they'd be Spauldings. They'd already be set.",
        "Olivia: But your father and Alexandra, I mean, they can turn on people on a dime. And who knows how they would treat a child of mine, even if it is yours? I don't know. I'd be more comfortable if I knew we were both on the same page.",
        "Phillip: Which page?",
        "Olivia: The same page, you know? We both feel the same...",
        "Phillip: Which page do I sign?",

        "Rick: I guess you're warming... Let me ask you something, Diamond Jim Brady, or Shyster, or whatever your name is. How long you been playing poker for?",
        "Sandy: Since I was four.",
        "Frank: Four? You never mentioned that.",
        "Sandy: You never asked.",

        "Frank: Absolutely. Hopefully it's going to be a very quiet night, and has been, and I'll get to be... Go home with my girlfriend.",

        "Cassie: Okay, you know what? Gus, Olivia rubs people the wrong way. I would think that, you know, half the town of Springfield thinks she excels in it.",
        "Gus: Half? Just half?",
        "Cassie: Look, obviously she did some kind of a number on you, but it's over, it's done with. Let it go. Just let it go, you know? Go home. Go home and make a great dinner for my very good and apparently very patient friend, okay?",

        "Cassie: Harley.",
        "Gus: Yeah, yeah. Harley. Yeah, I knew that. That's where I'm going. You know what? I'm late, too. I'm late to see my girl, because I had to have an argument with what's-her-face.",

        "Gus: I'm letting it go. I'm going right now. That's... This is me letting it go. It was nice talking to you, Cassie.",
