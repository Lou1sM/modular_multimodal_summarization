I nigh you seemed taller.", "Harley: Look, I'm going to prison, okay? I am going to prison.", "Gus: I'm not going to be disbarred and you're not going to prison so please. I need you to be positive.

But the idea of you getting your memory back is so exciting to me, it's easy to forget how overwhelming this is for you and I'm sorry about that.", "Michelle: Don't be. But I can't live my life waiting for that to happen, you know?", "Rick: Michelle, it's happening.", "Michelle: It's just little pieces here and there.

Tell you to behave yourself on the stand.", "Bill: No need to be warned, alan, I plan on telling the truth so help me.", "Alan: Well, that's very wise of you because no good will come of you sacrificing yourself for harley.

The only person you would hurt is yourself and olivia.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Hey, um... I... i don't want to go in there just yet, okay?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: Well, don't be long.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: Here, I need you to take care of this right away. Thank you.

I think that goes for us, too.", "Bill: We talk all the time. At least we used to.", "Harley: Did you listen to a word I said the other day?", "Bill: I don't know. What'd you say?", "Harley: You know what I said. I don't want you doing anything silly up on the stand today, okay?", "Bill: Something silly? Come on, that hurts.", "Harley: I'm serious.", "Bill: You don't think I know that. Look, if I can help...", "Harley: You can'T. Just tell the truth, okay?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: I don't know what you did, olivia, but good work.", "Olivia: I didn't do anything. Bill knows that emma and I are counting on him and he's going to do the right thing.", "Alan: Well I hope so for your your sake. Because I won't be a happy boss if I don't get what I want.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Baliff: All right, court is now in order. The on rabble judge ellis now presided.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Judge: Be seated. Mr. O'neill, you may call your next witness.", "Jeffrey: Yes, your honor.

I mean...", "Danny: Just concerned about my son, tony?", "Tony: Look, danny, I love the kid, too, okay?", "Danny: I know you do.", "Tony: And you also know i would never do anything to hurt robbie.", "Danny: Not intentionally, tony, no. But did you stop to think about robbie's feelings when you and michelle were planing this big move.", "Tony: It's not a big move, danny. The house is great, it's perfect he loves it there.", "Danny: But he's used to living with his mom and dad and now uncle tony will be there instead of me. Don't you think that might be a little confusing for him?", "Tony: Okay. What if we explain it to him.", "Danny: He's four years old. What's he going to understand?", "Tony: He's a lot smarter than you give him credit for.", "Danny: I know my own son, danny.", "Tony: What is it with you? You act like you never made a mistake, like you're the parent of the year, here?", "Danny: Compared to you and michelle.", "Tony: There it is again, putting down tony.", "Danny: You brought this on yourself.", "Tony: No, danny, you did, when you set off the bomb.

That's a big enough price to pay don't you think?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marina: Is tony here?", "Michelle: Hello to you, too, marina?", "Marina: I'm sorry, I just didn't expect you to answer the door.", "Michelle: He's not here. Can I give him a message.", "Marina: No. I don't even know what I was going to say, actually.", "Michelle: Okay.", "Marina: You're moving?", "Michelle: Yeah, moving in. Do you want to hang out?", "Marina: Why?", "Michelle: Because, I don't know, we were friends, right? You're datmng danny now. I think we should probably try to get along.", "Marina: No, danny and I...", "Michelle: Okay. Sorry, sorry.

You want to see them.", "Marina: Sure.", "Michelle: I think they're somewhere in here. One of these boxes.", "Marina: You threw this away. Danny's your son's father.", "Michelle: I don't hate danny, okay?", "Marina: Yeah? Well you could have fool me.", "Michelle: Marina, I didn't throw it away because I hate danny. I threw it away because I really don't want to... I don't want it bringing back anymore memories of him.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: Do you want know call somebody?", "Lizzie: No. I want to be here alone. I'm fine.", "Tammy: Okay. I'll just go.", "Lizzie: You must love this so much, tammy.", "Tammy: What? Why would I...", "Lizzie: I'm surprised you didn't say anything earlier, because this is what you said i deserved.", "Tammy: Lizzie, nobody deserves to lose their dad. That is not fair.", "Lizzie: Yeah, well, life isn't fair. Bad things happen everyday.", "Tammy: Yeah, but they're not supposed to happen to us.", "Lizzie: I don't think you actually believe that.", "Tammy: No. But I want to.", "Lizzie: I wish the bad things would just stop for a while.", "Tammy: Maybe. I really am sorry about your dad, lizzie.", "Lizzie: I know. You've been through this before.", "Tammy: I know how much you depended on him. I'm sorry.", "Lizzie: ( Sobbing )", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: Where is he?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Judge: Mr. O'neill, where is your witness?", "Jeffrey: Well, he was here just a little while ago.

In fact, I have a document right here that will even....", "Judge: Mr. Lewis, it's not your responsibility to introduce evidence into this court.", "Bill: Sorry. I just thought....", "Judge: Mr. O'neill?", "Jeffrey: Thank you, your honor. Mr. Lewis, do you consider yourself a friend of the defendant?", "Bill: Yes.", "Jeffrey: As a friend, would you say that the defendant became obsessed with taking down philip spaulding?", "Bill: No, not at all.", "Jeffrey: Not at all? Yet she created this whole alternate personality to get closer to phillip?", "Bill: Ruth?", "Jeffrey: That's right, ruth karloff.", "Bill: No, that was me. That was my idea.", "Jeffrey: Mr. Lewis, are you lying to the court to protect your friend?", "Bill: Mr. O'neill, I'm not lying at all. In fact, I have a sketch right here of what she was supposed to look like early on.", "Judge: Mr. Lewis...", "Bill: In fact, I even have the glasses I was going to wear because I was the one who was going to go undercover. It was all me. Excuse me, mr. Oh neil, you look quite well. Mr. Spaulding, I...", "Judge: Baliff, seize those items.", "Bill: One crumpet, that's all I ask for.", "Judge: Mr. Lewis, one more stunt like that and I'd hold you in contempt of court.", "Bill: I'm sorry, your honor.

Bill, were you aware that your friend harley disguised herself as ruth karloff the night that philip spaulding was murdered? Bill:, No, but I...", "Jeffrey: It would be safe to say harley could have developed an obsession with philip and you didn't know about it.", "Gus: He's leading the witness.", "Jeffrey: I withdraw. No further questions, your honor.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Judge: Mr. Aitoro?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: Mr. Lewis, the prosecution would like us to believe that miss cooper is a blood thirsty ex-wife was obsessed with her ex-husband, phillip spaulding. Are you saying that that is not true?", "Bill: That is not true. It's not. Like I said, I came up with the identity, I gave contacts. It was me. It was all me. In fact, she was feeling vulnerable and I took advantage of that.", "Gus: So let me get this straight: The scam to get philip spaulding, this was your idea and your's alone?", "Bill: Yes, yes, it was. In fact, harley was quite reluctant to do it.", "Gus: I see. And are there any witnesses to her reluctance?", "Bill: Yes. Yes. My wife. Olivia spencer lewis.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: See, marina, I'm happy with the way my life is now and I just don't need the look back.", "Marina: Are you afraid?", "Michelle: No.", "Marina: What difference does it make if you remember something?", "Michelle: It wouldn't, okay? I'm thinking about robbie and how confusing this all is to him.", "Marina: Anything else?", "Michelle: Not really. I'm moved on and so has danny.", "Marina: Okay.", "Michelle: I don't know why this is so hard for you to understand. I have tony and danny has you.", "Marina: Michelle, I told you...", "Michelle: Right, right. You told me. You told me. But you're obviously in love with him. Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.", "Marina: This isn't about me.", "Michelle: Yeah. Yeah, it is. It's about all of us.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Robbie: Mommy!", "Michelle: Hey! Hi.

Why are you here?", "Danny: Well, I ran into robbie and tony at the park.", "Robbie: Toys!", "Michelle: I brought a bunch of stuff over for you, I thought we could take it up to your old room.", "Danny: Michelle...", "Michelle: I know, I know.", "Robbie: Here, mommy.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Judge: Court is in recess. We'll take a 15-minute break.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Are you nuts?", "Bill: I gave my version of the truth.", "Harley: Because I was so reluctant to put on that wig and that fake nose.", "Bill: Well I guess you remember things one way and i remember them another.", "Harley: Really? How will olivia remember them?", "Bill: She'll remember it the right way.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: Well, I'm the next prosecution witness.", "Gus: Yeah. I'm aware of that. And I'm ready for you, okay, big al? Cross- examinations are us.", "Alan: Get unready, because there's not going to be any questions.", "Gus: You're dreaming.", "Alan: You don't understand, gus. When I get on the stand, you're going to rise and tell the judge you have no questions.", "Gus: Hmm, why would I do that?", "Alan: Because if you don't, I'm going to have the disbarment hearing moved up and you won't be able to defend harley. Your choice.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[local news break here - pre-empted about 5 minutes of the show]", "Danny: It's just that sometimes things change.

Not just about harley but about me. Why? Why did you have to drag me into this. Alan was already circling for blood.", "Bill: Would you stop talking about alan! We're talking abharley's freedom. That's more important than your place at spaulding. You asked me to have your back and I have. Now it's your turn.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: And you can confirm that the handkerchief that the defendant had in the videotape contained philip spaulding's blood and a hair sample from the defendant?
