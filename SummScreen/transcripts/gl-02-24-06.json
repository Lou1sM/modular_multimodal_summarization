        "Jonathan leaves to meet with a liquor distributor and Sandy shows up at Outskirts. Tammy tells him that she wants him to leave her alone and he threatens Jonathan. Jonathan runs into Cassie and Jeffrey at Company and tells them about Sandy. Cassie just tells Jonathan that it is yet another reason why he is bad for Tammy but Jonathan points out that Jeffrey has done pretty much all the same things he did. Jeffrey wants to know why she can think about forgiving him when she can't forgive Jonathan. Tammy shows up at Company and ask for Cassie and Jeffrey's help with Sandy. Sandy later shows up in the backseat of Jonathan's car and plays with his mind. Although at first she plays along, Beth informs Alan that she is not Lorelei and doesn't need her to get what she wants anymore. Beth tells Gus that the reason she did all of this was that on the day he was released Alan left her divorce papers on her bedside table. She also tells Gus that the thinks that Alan-Michael is in on something with his father since when he came back to town is when Alan started changing with her. Gus tells her that her problems with Alan don't have anything to do with him, but she hits him on his leg and reminds him about how he and Harley tricked her and threw her out of the company. She leaves the room and comes back with champagne and a birthday cake for Gus. Alan and Gus try to drug Beth but she turns it around on them and Alan realizes that she drugged the champagne. Beth leaves again and Alan is able to untie Gus before he passes out. Harley and Mallet wind up making a drug bust posing as a married couple, but when they go to sign the papers, Harley realizes the date. She goes to the site of the limo crash and wishes Gus a Happy Birthday. Mallet shows up with her and as they are leaving, see a person coming out of a house in the distance. Harley gasps that it is Gus."

        "Alan: It's so nice to see you again, Lorelei.",
        "Gus: Oh, yeah, Lorelei, her uh... little inner friend there, yeah.",
        "Alan: Yes. Yes, Lorelei used to come out whenever Beth needs to feel strong. And this is definitely one of those times, isn't it?",
        "Beth: ( With southern accent ) Oh, dang, Alan, honey. You caught me. I can't believe...",
        "Alan: Ow!",
        "Beth: It's Beth, Alan! Not Lorelei. Beth! And I'm sorry to say it, but this is exactly why I have to teach you a lesson.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: And done. And you said I couldn't study in a bar. So there.",
        "Jonathan: I'm the one that's having trouble working.",
        "Tammy: Isn't there someplace you're supposed to be right now?",
        "Jonathan: Nope.",
        "Tammy: Yes there is. You're supposed to meet with a liquor distributor.",
        "Jonathan: I can wait.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan, you don't have to guard me 24/7. I set Sandy straight; he's not going to bug me anymore.",
        "Jonathan: Whatever. I'm not going anywhere, so...",
        "Tammy: Go, please.",
        "Jonathan: All right, Farrah.",
        "Tammy: ( Laughs )",
        "Jonathan: I'll be right back; don't go anywhere.",
        "Sandy: I hear Dr. Beck's intern is going to be a killer.",
        "Tammy: Sandy, what are you doing here?",
        "Sandy: I thought we'd cram together, you know. If we go through the notes together, we'd team up--",
        "Tammy: No. No.",
        "Sandy: Why not? You do want to ace the exam, don't you?",
        "Tammy: Are you trying to get yourself killed?",
        "Sandy: Nice to see you have such faith in your boyfriend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Hi.",
        "Cassie: Hi.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm glad you came. I ordered us some... some wine. ( Laughing )",
        "Cassie: Okay.",
        "Jeffrey: Please. So, how was your day?",
        "Cassie: Fine.",
        "Jeffrey: Did you meet with R.J.'s teachers?",
        "Cassie: Is this what we do now, small talk?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, uh... the big stuff hasn't been going so well.",
        "Cassie: You lied to me, Jeffrey, about one too many things. It's not something I can get over just like that.",
        "Jeffrey: I know. I'm just glad you came. ( Door shuts ) ( cell phone rings )",
        "Jonathan: Hello? Yeah. You couldn't tell me this sooner? No, no, I'm not rescheduling. You just lost an account. Hey, guys. How's it going? Can I buy you guys dinner?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: They sure don't look like drug dealers.",
        "Mallet: No, that's part of their act. So, um... just follow my lead.",
        "Harley: Wait, wait, wait. I thought you were following my lead.",
        "Mallet: No, honey-- honey, honey, can we just not nag for once? I mean, come on, you're always nagging me. Can we just go out and have a good time? Maybe have some fun. Do you remember fun? Come on, sweetie, just lighten up for once.",
        "Harley: Lighten up? Can we talk? Seriously.",
        "Mallet: No I don't want to talk. Sorry, sorry. It's... women, can't live without them, can't shoot them.",
        "Dan: Yeah, ain't that the truth.",
        "Mallet: Now I'm interrupting your fun. You guys... How about-- I'm going to get us some drinks. Bartender, could we have a round over here? Tom-- Tom Mccoy. Nice to meet you. This is my wife, Katie.",
        "Cara: Cara Ludlow.",
        "Mallet: Nice to meet you.",
        "Cara: And this is my husband Dan.",
        "Mallet: Hi, Dan.",
        "Dan: Hi, how are you? Nice to meet you.",
        "Cara: So, what's the occasion. You're buying drinks for perfect strangers?",
        "Mallet: Uh... Geez, I don't know. It's Friday, I guess. And we've gone a whole week without a major blowup.",
        "Harley: Hey. ( Laughs ) Such a romantic. This ball and chain of mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: You know, something, if this weren't so insulting, it would be funny. I finally stand up for myself. I finally fight for something I believe in and you think that must mean I'm another person. Well, news flash for you Alan: I don't need Lorelei to fight my battles for me anymore. I don't need her to save your injured butts! And I sure as hell don't need her to decide what's best for me and my children.",
        "Alan: No, you don't. No, you don't, Beth and I apologize. But please, please don't hit me again.",
        "Beth: Well, now, that is something, isn't it? We both know how hard it is for you to admit that you're wrong. But I'm going to tell you something, Alan, you better start treating me with a little more respect, because if you don't, you're going to wish it really was Lorelei in this room with you. Well, I don't know about you two, but I'm starving. What shall we have for dinner, hmm?",
        "Gus: Well, I think it is going well, Dad, don't you?",
        "Beth: Did you tell your son about the lovely little gift you left for me the night you were released? Yeah. I know you're wondering if I got it and the answer is yes.",
        "Alan: No need to bring that up now.",
        "Beth: Oh, why not?",
        "Alan: I can explain that to you--",
        "Beth: It's a wonderful example of how you reward loyalty. You see, Gus, the night that Alan was released, when he didn't come home, Alexandra and I were very worried. And of course, I had the tracking device, but I couldn't use it with Alexandra there. So I went up to my bedroom to be alone, and guess what I found waiting for me on my bedside table?",
        "Alan: Beth.",
        "Beth: A letter from my loving husband serving me with a divorce. Do you have any idea what I had to give up to marry you? My daughter, my soul!",
        "Alan: Beth, please calm down. You're being dramatic.",
        "Beth: I did everything that you asked me to and the minute you were released, how did you reward me? You throw me out like the trash. You ditch me.",
        "Alan: I didn't ditch you. This is all a plan I had for us to be together.",
        "Beth: No, no, no, no, don't do this. Don't try to pull one over on poor, innocent Beth. Don't do it.",
        "Gus: Excuse me. You guys are having, like, a marital squabble and quite frankly it makes me uncomfortable. So maybe if you just want to let me go...",
        "Beth: Shut up!",
        "Gus: I'm just saying...",
        "Beth: ( Screams )",
        "Gus: ( Groans )",
        "Beth: Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh. Be quiet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Thank you. All right. Dan, here you go, cheers, man. You guys come here a lot.",
        "Dan: Yeah, sometimes.",
        "Mallet: So how long have you been married?",
        "Dan: Married? 12 years.",
        "Mallet: Really?",
        "Dan: Yourself?",
        "Mallet: Wow. Seven. Yeah, I guess that's when the itch is supposed to happen. Not that that ever happened to us.",
        "Harley: Not that it ever will.",
        "Mallet: No, siree.",
        "Harley: Tom wouldn't think of straying.",
        "Mallet: No, no, I honestly wouldn't because you are my everything, Katie. I wouldn't cheat, I swear. It's just... you know, I guess after seven years, you can kind of see why a guy would get tempted, you know? It is just a matter of spicing things up, a bit. You know what I'm talking about?",
        "Dan: Yeah, I know what you mean.",
        "Mallet: They say there's some... I don't know, they say there's stuff out there that kind of...",
        "Dan: Stuff?",
        "Mallet: You know, helps you along pills.",
        "Dan: I wouldn't know anything about that.",
        "Mallet: I guess you can't get it at a drugstore. You got to get it at a source or something. But... what do they call it? They call it the love drug. The love drug, it's supposed to heighten sensation or something like that, I don't know.",
        "Harley: What are you boys talking about?",
        "Mallet: Just guy stuff sweetie. Juts go back to your girl talk.",
        "Harley: Girl talk? Such a caveman this guy. Don't you think? ( Laughter )",
        "Dan: Honey, we need to be going.",
        "Cara: We do?",
        "Dan: Yes, we do.",
        "Mallet: No. Come on, guys, don't leave yet. We're just getting to know each other.",
        "Dan: Bartender?",
        "Harley: You had to do it, didn't you. Can I talk to you?",
        "Mallet: What?",
        "Harley: You had to do it, didn't you?",
        "Mallet: What did I do?",
        "Harley: You know what you did.",
        "Mallet: I have no idea what you're talking about. Not a clue.",
        "Harley: You pumped Dan for information. Excuse me, I'm so embarrassed. Tom and I... we heard from our son's best friend's parents that they came to this bar and they met a couple and they bought this drug from them. A sex-enhancing drug, if you know what I mean. We walked in, I said to Tom, \"That's not them, no way is that them.\" But still you had to try and get some information from them, didn't you?",
        "Mallet: Okay, okay, blame me. Okay, great. But who's fault is it that we're here in the first place?",
        "Harley: I beg your pardon?",
        "Mallet: I think you know what I'm talking about.",
        "Harley: I'm not going to have this conversation with you in front of strangers.",
        "Mallet: It's pretty obvious that we need help. It's pretty obvious to you guys that we need help, all right. Our love life sucks. It's just like... nothing. So it is no great secret. You know, I used to kiss her and she would just melt.",
        "Harley: I still melt.",
        "Mallet: There's no melting going on.",
        "Harley: I melt!",
        "Mallet: There's no melting.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: You promised you would stay away. You're already going back on your word.",
        "Sandy: I thought you meant to steer clear of you when you were with Jonathan. You didn't mean all the... you did mean all of the time. That's crazy, because we go to the same school, we're in the same class, we're bound to run into each other, like right now.",
        "Tammy: We didn't just run into each other. Jonathan owns this place.",
        "Sandy: So I'm supposed to just lock myself in a room and stop having a life.",
        "Tammy: No, just have it somewhere else. Move on.",
        "Sandy: Move on. Move on, Sandy, but I'm going to tell you exactly where you can and can't go. Does that sound fair?",
        "Tammy: Nope. Just like it is not fair I married a bigamist. But I dealt with that, so now you deal with this.",
        "Sandy: When did you get so cold.",
        "Tammy: Just leave me alone, okay? Do you get it? Just leave me alone!",
        "Sandy: Don't you take that tone with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: There is no reason for you to pay for our dinner.",
        "Jonathan: I'm not trying to buy you out, if that's what you're thinking. I just thought maybe for a minute we could talk about... okay. Maybe not. Bad idea.",
        "Jeffrey: Jonathan, what's on your mind?",
        "Jonathan: It's about Tammy.",
        "Cassie: What about Tammy?",
        "Jonathan: Well, we need to keep Sandy as far away from her as possible.",
        "Cassie: Why? Because you're afraid she might go back to him?",
        "Jonathan: No, because the guy is losing it.",
        "Cassie: I know the feeling.",
        "Jonathan: Sandy's always been a little messed up, but losing Tammy really pushed him over the edge. He's been harassing her a lot.",
        "Jeffrey: What do you mean by that? What do you mean harassing?",
        "Jonathan: Basically, he is stalking her. So if you want to help your daughter you better chill out about me because it is going to take all of us to keep her safe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: I cannot believe you just did that.",
        "Mallet: I just wanted to see if you'd melt.",
        "Harley: No I didn't melt. That's not what we're talking about here. ( Laughter )",
        "Mallet: Sorry.",
        "Cara: You had me worried for a minute.",
        "Dan: You were worried?",
        "Cara: I'm sorry. Dan's instincts are usually really good, but they were so wrong this time.",
        "Dan: Lucky for us. Tom, right. You know the couple you're looking for? You found them.",
        "Harley: You two?",
        "Dan: Yeah. At first I was afraid you were cops, but I just saw you two bickering right now, no way.",
        "Cara: Only a real couple would fight like that.",
        "Dan: Yeah. This is what you're looking for.",
        "Mallet: No way. Is this... can I... can I...",
        "Dan: Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's more where that came from.",
        "Mallet: How much is it?",
        "Dan: Ten bucks a pop, and it's worth every penny. Buy in quantity, I'll give you a discount.",
        "Mallet: Wow, this works for me. Honey, does it work for you?",
        "Harley: It definitely works for me.",
        "Mallet: Great then let's give it a try and have some fun and party and you guys are under arrest.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Leave me alone.",
        "Sandy: You know, you never would have spoke to me like that before you started going out with Jonathan. He's behind this whole thing, isn't he? You don't really want me to stay away from you, but Jonathan...",
        "Tammy: Jonathan didn't tell me to do anything, Sandy.",
        "Sandy: The idea of living behind a bar, that was all yours?",
        "Tammy: Yes, it was.",
        "Sandy: You know, I remember when your idea of a home was a sweet, little cottage. I bought that for you.",
        "Tammy: You know what?",
        "Sandy: Jonathan torched it.",
        "Tammy: You're not part of my life and how I live it is none of your business.",
        "Sandy: But how I live mine is your business? Where I can and can't go? Who I can and can't see?",
        "Tammy: I just want you to stay away from me.",
        "Sandy: Wait. I hate what Jonathan's doing to you. He's dragging you down to his level, and it makes me sick. A part of me wants to just...",
        "Tammy: Wants to what, Sandy.",
        "Sandy: Nothing.",
        "Tammy: No, say it. Say how you really feel?",
        "Sandy: All right. He's dragging me down to his level, too, because a part of me wants him to fall off a cliff again. Because, believe me, this time I'd make sure he stays dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You're saying Sandy is stalking Tammy?",
        "Jonathan: Ask Tammy if you don't believe me. Look Cassie, I really don't give a crap whether you really like me or not, but I thought that you'd be interested in helping your daughter. My mistake.",
        "Cassie: You know, Jonathan, if you really cared about her, you would admit you are no good for her and you would let her go. You are a hypocrite.",
        "Jonathan: Me?",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Jonathan: What about you? You lied pretending to be somebody else. Man, how do you trust a guy after that? But here you are with your bottle of wine sitting all cozy and cute judging the rest of the world. I don't claim to love Tammy. I do love her, and I'm going to protect her from Sandy. I just thought maybe you would want to help. But anyway... enjoy your meal.",
        "Jeffrey: Jonathan. He's right.",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Jeffrey: He's right. I did lie to you. I misrepresented myself and what he did wasn't that much different. It wasn't. So I guess that begs the question: If you can forgive me, why can't you forgive him?",
        "Cassie: And who says I've forgiven you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Officer: Let's go.",
        "Mallet: That was a beautiful thing, Cooper. That was a beautiful thing. You're as good as ever. No, you know what? You're better.",
        "Harley: What was with that kiss?",
        "Mallet: Drastic times call for drastic measures. You were kind of in the process of blowing our cover.",
        "Harley: Well, don't do it again. I don't like being put in that position.",
        "Mallet: I'm sorry, what position? Pretending to be my wife? It's our most obvious cover. I mean, come on, how many times have we used it before?",
        "Harley: That was before.",
        "Mallet: Before. Right.",
        "Harley: It was awful, okay? It felt wrong to be pretending to be somebody else's wife.",
        "Mallet: Okay, I'm sorry.",
        "Harley: No. It's not your fault. It's not your fault. I've just got to... I've got to get past these feelings, you know, and get my head back in the game and just focus on being a pro for both our sakes.",
        "Mallet: Okay. I'm fine with that. I'm sorry. Next time we'll do some brother/sister thing or something.",
        "Officer: Okay, so who's going to sign the paperwork?",
        "Harley: I'll sign it. Oh, my God.",
        "Mallet: What?",
        "Harley: It's today.",
        "Mallet: What's today?",
        "Harley: It's today.",
        "Mallet: What? What's today?",
        "Officer: I'm sure I filled it out right detective. The name, the time of the arrest, the date?",
        "Mallet: Yes. Oh, the date. Oh. Oh, no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Well, now that you're both treating me with a little more respect, let's see what I can get you for dinner.",
        "Gus: Can I recommend a marriage counselor?",
        "Alan: She'll crack.",
        "Gus: If you ask me, I think the cracking already happened, don't you? Have you seen my leg? My leg and your arm, together we equal one person. So that's all we got. We've got each other. We got to work together, unless you feel like you can trust her.",
        "Alan: I hope I don't regret it.",
        "Gus: Come on, you can do it. Come on.",
        "Beth: Hey, guys. Hey... I know we got off on the wrong foot, but it doesn't have to be all bad, right? We can get some things done without getting too ugly, hmmm?",
        "Alan: Sure.",
        "Gus: Of course.",
        "Beth: Good. In that case, I think maybe we should reverse the order tonight. Have dessert before dinner. A little birdie told me it was your birthday.",
        "Alan: That's right, Gus. It's your birthday, isn't it, son?",
        "Gus: God, now he remembers.",
        "Beth: Alan would you hold that?",
        "Alan: Sure.",
        "Beth: And that's not all.",
        "Alan: Chocolate. Your favorite, chocolate.",
        "Beth: ( Humming ) ( laughs ) Champagne! You don't mind a little bubbly, do you, Alan?",
        "Alan: No, not at all.",
        "Beth: Let me help you with that, hmm. Yeah. Delicious.",
        "Alan: Hit the spot.",
        "Beth: Hmmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael Dempsey, \"Inside The Light.\" I can be serious like Alan-Michael. How am I not like Alan-Michael? I didn't grow up with a trust fund. I got to take it all off. I got my first one in California. Okay, just one. I got that in Ireland. See Alan-Michael Wednesday, March 1, \"Inside The Light\".",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Don't start. I knew it was your birthday. I've known about it for weeks. I've been dreading it, that's all. The kids are actually working on cards for you. Oh, by the way, thanks for telling Zach that all the crayons had a different flavor. Anyway, seeing them work on the cards with the hearts and the \"I love you's,\" was too much, it almost killed me, so I blocked it out. Until today, when I saw that date on that arrest report. Anyway, this is for you. I know you'd rather have beer and pizza. Anyway... I decided, I'm going to build the house. I think it's a good idea. I'm going to live there with the kids. And... and before you hear it from somebody else, I've gone back on the force. And you'll never guess in a million years who my partner is. You guessed. It's Mallet. I know you'd love that. He's a really good guy. So... this is the most pathetic excuse for a birthday party ever. Happy birthday, baby. You deserve more. You deserve so much more.",
        "Mallet: Hey, will this... will this help? And I also got a large sausage pizza in the car, extra onions, no napkins, just the way Gus would like it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Chocolate cake. It's my favorite. Thank you.",
        "Beth: I wish you could have some champagne, but, you know, with the medication you're taking, I don't think you should.",
        "Gus: I'm a beer guy anyway, so... but just the fact that you remembered is very sweet.",
        "Beth: Hmm.",
        "Alan: You know, Gus is right, Beth. That's very thoughtful of you to remember his birthday. And you know what? We were wrong. We realize that... well, we realize that we underestimated you.",
        "Gus: That's quite an accomplishment. I mean, what you've done so far and everything. You know, and believe me, I understand you being upset with this one here, the things he's done to you.",
        "Beth: Well, you see, Gus, it's not just Alan.",
        "Gus: Right. Harley and me?",

Meanwhile, Harley welcomes Alan-Michael with open arms. Ever wonder why he came back to town when he did? Why don't you ask dear old dad about that one? Huh, Dad?",
        "Gus: What, you're working with Alan-Michael?",
        "Beth: Well, it's nothing that I can prove. But big Al over there started pulling away from me just when Alan-Michael came back to town. You do the math.",
