I want to deal with it before it gets worse.", "Tony: This is about what happened to Nico the other night. You're worried about that drug on the street -- What's it called? D? Delirium? Something like that, right? I'm not sure.", "Danny: You know that's what it is. Don't play dumb.", "Tony: Well, maybe you should, Danny. I'm serious.", "Danny: Why?", "Tony: Because the kid, living in your house, right? Living upstairs, ends up in the ER sky-high on D, not to mention in the middle of your campaign, okay? Now, you think... Come on, look at me. Seriously, Danny, you think the press had fun with the story of me getting into a fight? They're going to have a field day with this one, man. I'm telling you. Stay out of it. Let it go, okay?", "Danny: Too late.", "(Knock at door)", "Tony: What is this, Danny?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: You'll see. Hey, Lizzie.", "Lizzie: Hey.

Yeah, yeah. It sounded like...", "Michelle: Shots.", "Marina: Sounded like shots, yes. Yes, Carrie had a gun.", "Michelle: Buzz had a gun, too. They're shooting!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Billy: She's gone!", "Ed: The current took her.", "Josh: Oh, God. Marah? Marah, are you all right?", "Billy: Reach for her, Alan. Go ahead.", "Alan: I did!", "Ed: Billy, she's gone.", "Buzz: Dear God, not again.", "Josh: Marah, sweetheart, can you even hear me?", "Marah: Dad? Daddy? Why are you looking at me like that?", "Ed: She's in shock, Josh.", "Josh: Why don't you let me take that from you, sweetheart?", "Marah: I was looking for you.", "Josh: I know.", "Marah: It's so bright in here.", "Buzz: That poor kid. Look what we've done to her.", "Josh: Just let it go, honey.", "Marah: Where's Carrie?", "Josh: She can't hurt us anymore, honey.", "Marah: But she was here.", "Josh: I know. But she's not here now. She's gone.", "Marah: Where did she go?", "Josh: Don't you know?", "Marah: Know what?", "Josh: Nothing. Listen to me now: The only thing you need to know is that everything is going to be okay. Do you understand what I'm saying? Everything's going to be okay. Just wait here for a minute. I did this. I shot that woman.", "Billy: Oh, God, Josh...", "Josh: It was her or me, so I pulled the trigger. I killed Carrie Caruthers. I acted alone. I was here alone. No one else.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: Where were you headed?", "Reva: I don't know. I just thought maybe I would go to the Beacon to see Cassie or check on Marah at the Museum.", "Jeffrey: Are you okay?", "Reva: Yeah, I'm just a little out of sorts, that's all.", "Jeffrey: Why? What's up?", "Reva: Let's talk about you. Why did you show up on my doorstep unannounced, for instance?", "Jeffrey: Well, it's an official visit, actually.", "Reva: You're always working, aren't you?", "Jeffrey: Well, there's always work to do, Reva, and I was hoping that you might be able to help me with some of it.", "Reva: Why? Do you have another license plate you want me to read?", "Jeffrey: No.", "Reva: But you do have something you want me to read. I'm not on your payroll, Jeffrey.", "Jeffrey: Oh, come on, Reva. You've consulted on cases with me before. Right? I mean...", "Reva: Is it the same case?", "Jeffrey: No, actually, I'm interested in a specific individual.", "Reva: Who?", "Jeffrey: A person you met the other night at the Valentine's Dance at the Country Club -- a woman that you'd never met before.", "Reva: The woman who danced with Josh?", "Jeffrey: Yeah, that's right. I was wondering if you had any sort of, you know, feeling about her. That night or since then, you know? Some sort of an intuition or...", "Reva: Why are you asking? And why tonight?", "Jeffrey: Well, I... I can't tell you that. Like you said, you're not on my payroll.", "Reva: Oh, but I'm just supposed to help you anyway, is that it?", "Jeffrey: Please? Consider it a favor. How about this: You consider it your community service for the month. Come on, Reva. Did you get something? Did you feel anything about her or... you know, something concrete?", "Reva: I wish I knew.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: You know, I brought Nico to the hospital. I didn't put him in there.", "Danny: Come on, Lizzie. It's time to tell the real story.", "Lizzie: I have no idea what you're talking about.", "Danny: I'm talking about D. Delirium, the latest rave drug, your new best friend. We know you use the stuff Lizzie, and deal it to anyone with a $20 bill.", "Lizzie: This is totally absurd!", "Danny: We know that Nico got it from you.", "Lizzie: (Scoffs) Why would I deal drugs, okay? Why would I need anyone else's money?", "Danny: I have no idea, but facts are facts.", "Lizzie: Yeah, and they're a lie, okay? Who told you this?", "Danny: I'll tell you if you tell me.", "Lizzie: What do you mean?", "Danny: Tell me who your supplier is, who gave you the D that Nico took, and we'll take it from there.", "Lizzie: Danny, there is no supplier, okay? I'm telling you, I have nothing to do with drugs, okay? This \"D\" stuff or anything else.", "Danny: Maybe you want to tell that to the district attorney.", "Lizzie: You know, you don't scare me, all right? Once my grandfather finds out about all this stuff you're blaming on me and criticizing me, you know what? You are going to be the one talking to the district attorney.", "Tony: Maybe, Lizzie, but we know you are involved with D and that comes from a very good source.", "Lizzie: Who?", "Danny: Nico.", "Lizzie: Nico said that?", "Danny: That you've got a pipeline to as much D as you can use or sell. Lizzie, you understand that as a candidate for mayor, I'm obligated to report anything I know or learn about involving illegal drug trafficking to the police. So why don't you just work with me? Tell me who you get your stuff from, maybe I can put off that call.", "Lizzie: That lying, unappreciative creep. And I actually tried to help him?", "Danny: Help him score some D.", "Lizzie: Danny, I am telling you, Blade is the one whose fault it is, okay? From Fifth Street. He invited me to a party and then he gave me this drink that was spike with that drug. Nico drank it. That is why he's in the hospital. Look, I don't care what Nico says, I had never even heard of Delirium, okay, nevertheless sold it. Okay?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nico: No, it's not okay.", "Danny: Nico.", "Nico: Listen, and listen good, okay? You may think I owe you for all the favors you cut me, but don't you ever mention my name in a lie. Ever.", "Lizzie: You mean to tell me you didn't tell him that?", "Nico: I didn't tell him squat. You know what the problem is here? Some people just don't know when to leave things alone.", "Danny: Nico, I'm trying to prevent...", "Nico: I know what you're trying to do. You know, you've got some damn nerve, man.", "Danny: You won't talk to me about what happened to you.", "Nico: Well, I had my reasons.", "Danny: Right. You want to protect this punk, Blade, stop me from going after him.", "Nico: Look, think what you want to think, but that's not why I kept quiet.", "Danny: You're protecting somebody.", "Nico: Yeah. Her. You know, she didn't do anything wrong except look hot enough to get invited to this party. That's no crime. But if this gets out, do you know what kind of grief she's going to catch? A Spaulding hanging out with a guy from the hood who ends up tripping out on D? It wasn't her fault. Besides, I'm all better now, so why don't you just leave it alone?", "Lizzie: Thank you.", "Nico: That's okay. Swear to me that you don't mention her name -- to the cops, her family, nobody.", "Danny: I'm not going to drop this, Nico. I'm not.", "Nico: Hey, do what you've got to do, Danny, but leave Lizzie out of it. For me.", "Danny: Okay.", "Nico: Let's get out of here before he changes his mind.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tony: That went well.", "Danny: Yeah.", "Tony: Don't you think?", "Danny: It did. I got what I wanted: A name. Blade.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: Her name is Carrie Caruthers.", "Reva: Huh?", "Jeffrey: The woman at the dance? Her name is Carrie.", "Reva: Carrie. Is she wanted for something?", "Jeffrey: Now, hang on. I thought I was going to ask the questions.", "Reva: Yeah, well, you're the one that has all the information and I have none.", "Jeffrey: You really are in a lousy mood.", "Reva: Why should I be the psychic conduit for this woman Carrie? I met her. We talked for, like, five minutes.", "Jeffrey: I know.", "Reva: But you act as if that I'm supposed to have some special connection to the woman.", "Jeffrey: Do you?", "Reva: I don't know. How's that for an answer?", "Jeffrey: It's a start. What's so compelling about that sketch, Reva?", "Reva: It's just... it's a ring, like the one she was wearing the night of the dance.", "Jeffrey: Carrie?", "Reva: Yeah, and it's strange. I can't seem to get the image out of my mind.", "Jeffrey: Did you talk to her about the ring?", "Reva: A little.", "Jeffrey: Looks like it's an antique. That's interesting.", "Reva: She said something about her grandmother getting it in Venice.", "Jeffrey: What? Reva, come on. Tell me. Anything could be helpful here. Please.", "Reva: Just recently I've been getting other images. Swirling water, and I thought maybe it was because the ring was from Venice -- you know, Venice, water. Maybe I just have water on the brain, because how could they possibly be related.", "Jeffrey: You're not sure.", "Reva: No. (Sighs in exasperation) When I am, you'll be the first to know.", "Jeffrey: Okay, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I apologize if I pushed too hard. It's just, I'm good at that.", "Reva: And I'm sorry if I can't be more help with this Carrie thing, but I seriously met her for five minutes and we talked, that's basically it.", "Jeffrey: That's basically it except for the ring, which bothered you enough that you felt the urge to draw it.", "Reva: Right.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "(Winding toy)", "(Carnival music playing)", "Billy: Whoa, Josh. Josh, let's just talk about this for a second.", "Josh: No, Billy. There's nothing to talk about, all right? Look, you guys are all fathers. If you were in my shoes, you would do the same thing.", "Buzz: You're going to tell the cops you shot the woman.", "Josh: Yeah, that's pretty much it, Buzz. She was, whatever, deranged.", "Billy: But wait a minute. How did you manage to just come to this affair with a gun?", "Josh: She had been threatening me. She insisted that I meet her here and so I came prepared to defend myself.", "Buzz: That gun is registered to me.", "Josh: I knew where you kept it, so I took it. I borrowed it. I stole it. Whatever!", "Ed: Josh...", "Josh: It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. The point is this: She fired at me and missed so before she could take another shot, I fired at her.", "Billy: Okay, self-defense.", "Josh: Yes. It was her or me. And then... and then she... she fell through the trap door there. I tried to help her, but I couldn't. She fell through and the river carried her away, and that is what happened.", "Alan: Josh, if the river carried her away, then there's no body to prove that anything happened.", "Josh: Alan. Alan.", "Alan: No one outside of us should know anything.", "Josh: No! No! I am not going to go that way again. Not this time.", "Billy: How the hell did we find ourselves here again?", "Ed: Just lucky.", "Josh: Look, guys, we don't have a lot of time to talk about this, okay? We've got to figure out where we were, what happened, and how it happened.", "Buzz: So when Carrie's body is found with a bullet in it, you're going to go down as the shooter. Right?", "Josh: Yes. Case closed.", "Billy: Josh. Josh...", "Josh: Just go! Okay? All of you. Just go. Hey. I want you to take Marah, okay? Go find Marina and Michelle and get them out of here. Listen to me. I'm going to give you all a head start, but I'm going to call the police and wait for them to arrive.", "Ed: Here. Alone.", "Josh: Yes. Well, I was the only one here when Carrie went down through that trap door, so I've got to be here alone, right?", "Billy: Josh, what about us?", "Josh: I don't care. Make up a story. Make up a fairy tale. It doesn't matter. What you all have to keep in mind is this: What happened... what happened here tonight happened between me and Carrie. No one else.", "Billy: No. No. No, Josh. I saw it, too. I can corroborate. You talk about the way things have to be; this is the way it has to be. Don't argue with me, Josh.", "Ed: I was here, too.", "Buzz: I saw the whole damn thing. Self-defense.", "Billy: All three of us.", "Alan: Four, Josh. We started this thing together and we're going to see it through together.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: Reva?", "Reva: You should go.", "Jeffrey: Reva?", "Reva: I can't do this anymore.", "Jeffrey: Did you see something? Did you feel something?", "Reva: No, you really... I said I want you to go, okay?", "Jeffrey: Okay, okay.", "Reva: I'm sorry, I just... I need to get some air.", "Jeffrey: Steady. Hey, hey, hey, hey.", "Reva: My head's swimming.", "Jeffrey: Are you okay? I think you've got low blood sugar or something. You know what? I've got something in here that might do the trick. It's an energy bar.", "Reva: No, it's okay.", "Jeffrey: No, no, no, Reva. I've got it right here.", "Reva: Really, I said it's fine.", "Jeffrey: Okay, where is it? It's in here, somewhere.", "Reva: Jeffrey, it's really okay. I don't need...", "Jeffrey: I know I had it somewhere. I guess it's... Hmm. I guess I don't...", "Reva: Who is this?", "Jeffrey: Oh. It's a vic in a cold case. Poor thing.", "Reva: You mean she's dead?", "Jeffrey: Yeah, yeah. For about thirty years now.", "Reva: She seemed so alive.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: I can't do this anymore.", "Marina: Why won't you let us back in? Why won't they let us back in?", "Michelle: I don't know, I don't know.", "Marina: I feel so, like, tired.", "Michelle: How long have we been here?", "Marina: I don't know. I mean... Wait, do you mean outside or do you mean the whole thing?", "Michelle: Outside.", "Marina: I don't know. What's wrong?", "Michelle: I don't know. I just feel like... Marah. Marina, feels like I'm underwater.", "Marina: Yeah, I know. I know. I know we do. It's so weird. I feel like... really dizzy and I can't remember things.", "Michelle: We got to get back in there. We got to get back in there. Marah is still in there. Come on, Marina.", "Marina: Okay.", "Michelle: What's going on in there? What is going on? Marah? We can't leave her. What if she's the one that...?", "Marina: No, no.", "Michelle: What if she's hurt?", "Maria: No, she's ok. She's okay. She's okay.", "Michelle: Marah, please.", "Marina: Marah?!", "Michelle: Marah, please?!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marah: I hear water.", "Josh: Yeah, there's a river that runs underneath this whole place.", "Marah: I like it.", "Josh: Marah, I need you do something for me. Look at me, sweetheart. I need for you to go home with Ed Bauer and let him take you home, okay?", "Marah: Ed?", "Josh: Yeah.", "Marah: Aren't you going to come?", "Josh: Later. There's some things I have to do.", "Marah: You have to work?", "Josh: I'll explain it to you when I see you again, okay? It won't be long, I promise.", "Marah: Dad, I'm scared.", "Josh: You don't have to be scared. You're safe. Everyone's safe.", "Marah: Do I have to go?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Josh: Yes, you do, sweetheart. Right now. It's okay.", "Ed: Come on, honey, I'll take you home. Let's go. Everything's going to be fine. Are you sure about this?", "Josh: Yes, I'm sure. You're a doctor, you know. And I think she needs a doctor, Ed.", "Ed: But the point is if I go now, I don't know what to tell the girls. I don't want to tell them.", "Josh: You need a story. Here's the basic story: Carrie Caruthers came to me looking for a job...", "Billy: This is the story you told Frank over at Lewis?", "Josh: Yes.", "Ed: Okay, good.", "Josh: She wouldn't take no for an answer. She started to threaten me. Now, this is the same story. It will gel with the story that I told Frank a few days ago.", "Alan: Good, good. That's good, Josh.", "Josh: We'll figure out the rest of it later. Just get home. And, listen, can you do something about the gunfire residue on her hands?", "Ed: Yes, I'll clean her up. Aren't the police going to wonder why I'm not here?", "Josh: I'll tell them that I asked you to go to Marah and Shayne before they heard the story from somebody else.", "Ed: Okay.", "Josh: Thank you. You can still back out, you know, all of you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Billy: No, no. The more witnesses you get to corroborate, the sooner you're off the hook.", "Alan: Is there any proof that Carrie threatened you?", "Josh: Nothing on paper.", "Billy: Oh, yeah, she did come to the Country Club the other day, and she threatened you... she threatened you in front of all of us.", "Buzz: That's why we followed you, because she's so whacked out.", "Alan: And when we heard that she wanted to see you here...", "Josh: Yeah.", "Alan: Then we all decided there's no way you're going to do it alone.", "Billy: No. Much too dangerous.", "Josh: What about Buzz's wound? What are we going to say about that?", "Buzz: I brought the gun just in case. She flipped out, aimed the gun at you, I pulled my gun. She winged me.", "Alan: You dropped the gun.", "Billy: You picked it up.", "Alan: You tried to reason with her. You told her to drop her gun.", "Buzz: But she completely lost it and aimed the gun again.", "Josh: And so before she could fire again, I shot her.", "Billy: Shot her in self-defense. And not only that, you saved all of our butts.", "Buzz: Frank saw the gun in my hand earlier. It fits.", "Josh: Wait a second. Wait a second. You have to get your prints on the gun. Okay? And now my prints are on top of yours.", "Buzz: Ah, you know, the gun powder residue you had cleaned off of Marah, you don't have any on you. They're going to conclude you never fired that gun.", "Josh: I fired twice. The second shot... the second shot hit Carrie. The first shot went wild.", "(Gun fires)", "(Glass breaks)", "Josh: Now everything's perfect.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nico: Well, go on. Your chauffeur's waiting.", "Lizzie: He works for me. Not the other way around. So you and I can go for a ride, maybe.", "Nico: I'll pass. Thanks. The last trip was more than enough.", "Lizzie: Okay. Well, I'm glad to see you're feeling better.", "Nico: Yeah, well, I think you should get going because it's getting kind of cold with the door open.", "Lizzie: You know what? Do you do this often?", "Nico: What?", "Lizzie: Well, you know, flip-flop. You know, hot one minute, cold the next.", "Nico: What are you talking about?", "Lizzie: Well, first you're completely blas\u00e9 toward me, and then you completely defend me in front of Danny just now. And you snatched that drink out of my hand before I could even have a sip of it. You're protecting me like you actually care.", "Nico: Yeah, well, I'm just doing what I think is right?", "Lizzie: Oh, and it just so happens that involves me. Hmm?", "Nico: When you're around, yeah.", "Lizzie: All right, well, then do me a favor, all right? If you're going to do that, don't pretend like you're not the one doing it. You may think this is cool and everything, but I don't like mixed signals.", "(Kiss)", "Lizzie: Keep warm, okay?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: Well...", "Tony: Great. Now you know that Blade is running D. Well, surprise, Danny, I know, too.", "Danny: What's that supposed to mean?", "Tony: Well, it means the fact... You know what? You wanted me here. You wanted me here to hear this little story so I could go out there and put the fear of God in this kid.", "Danny: That's not true. It's not.", "Tony: Okay, come on. Danny, listen, if I make the right impression on him there's no D to be had on Fifth Street, right?", "Danny: Tony, I want that drug off every street in the city. And I'm not asking you to do anything. I'm taking care of this myself.", "Tony: You... you... you didn't hear a damn word I just said.", "Danny: I'm not dropping this, Tony. I'm just getting started.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marina: That was another shot.", "Michelle: Dad!", "Marina: Oh, God, Marah. Thank God you're okay.", "Michelle: What happened in there? What happened?", "Marina: Yeah, we heard shots.", "Ed: Everything is fine.", "Michelle: Why did you lock the door? Dad, is it really fine?", "Ed: Everything is under control.", "Marina: But there were shots.", "Ed: All right, that stuff is over. What we have to do now is we have to get her home. And I could use a hand, okay?", "Michelle: Uh-huh. Marah, are you okay?", "Marah: It was so bright in there.", "Ed: Look, we got to get her to the car, okay?", "Michelle: Yeah. Daddy, what happened?", "Ed: It's over, honey. We did what we had to do. We all did.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Billy: Okay, I think everything is taken care of except for this.", "Josh: Wait, wait, wait. Carrie was wearing gloves, but my prints might be on that gun here. Clean it up, put it back.", "Alan: The gun was fired. It matches up our story.", "Josh: We know what we're going to tell the police. What about the girls?", "Billy: Just hold a second. Take just one step at a time. Let's finish this one first.", "Buzz: I think we're ready for it.", "Josh: Not yet. You have to leave.", "Alan: Josh, we agreed that we would all go through this together.", "Josh: Alan, we are not friends. We have never been friends. That makes you a liability. If you are here, it screws up my story.", "Buzz: He's right.", "Alan: We've worked together; we've known each other for years.", "Josh: But we're not friends. You have to go.", "Alan: I set this nightmare in motion thirty years ago and I...", "Josh: Ancient history, Alan. We have to focus on what's happening right here and now, tonight. Now I appreciate the fact that you want to stick up for me. Believe me, I would love to take you up on it, but you can't. You know you can't.", "Alan: We'll talk later.", "Josh: You know what's so crazy about this?", "Billy: What?", "Josh: It's that we're so good at it. I mean look at this. Look at this. We put our heads together, we come up with a whole new, a whole new thing here. A whole new lie.", "Buzz: Survival.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tony: You've lost it, Danny, you know that?", "Danny: Yeah. Look who's talking.", "Tony: I'm looking out for you. You get your nose in this, there's no telling where it's going to lead you or how it ends, Danny.", "Danny: Come on, Tony. What's life without a little adventure?", "Tony: Taking on these dealers is political suicide, and you know it.", "Danny: And since when are you an authority on politics?", "Tony: Well, we grew up with the same people, right?", "Danny: Mm-hmm.", "Tony: I can see the headlines right now: \"It Takes One to Know One. Santos Goes After Old Pals.\"", "Danny: Tony...", "Tony: It's good for the image, don't you think?", "Danny: Tony, this drug poses a major threat to the community.", "Tony: Maybe. Maybe it does. But you know what? Trying to wipe it out poses a threat to you. Not to mention your family, man. You get involved, Danny, you could kiss the campaign good bye, you hear me? You could kiss it good bye.", "Danny: Or maybe it's puts me right into the mayor's office. Have you thought about that?", "Tony: You don't listen to me. You don't listen.", "Danny: Tony, I know the risk going after the people behind D. And I can handle them.", "Tony: Okay, famous last words.", "Danny: And if I score points with the public for getting it out of Springfield in time for the elections, all the better, right?", "Tony: Boy, you've got it all figured out, don't you?", "Danny: Ross has a lot of pluses going for him right now. The voters see him as the Law and Order candidate. And how do they see me?", "Tony: A maybe, maybe not reformed mobbed boss.", "Danny: Right.", "Tony: Okay.", "Danny: This is my shot to take the moral high ground away from Ross...", "Tony: This...", "Danny: And neutralize his advantage.", "Tony: Danny, this is not a board game you're talking about. This is real life, okay?", "Danny: Yeah, I know that. I know all about the real life, Tony.", "Tony: You do? So you're telling me that you're ready to take this wherever it leads you, wherever you need to go? Because that's what you need to get involved in this game!", "Danny: I wouldn't be doing this if I weren't ready.", "Tony: So I guess Michelle and Robbie are then, right?", "Danny: Look, leave them out of it.", "Tony: No, I won't leave them out of it.", "Danny: Leave them out of it. And don't talk about them like that. I know what I'm doing! And if I... Just watch me.", "Tony: Danny, Danny, Danny, it's a mistake, okay. It's a....", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: Okay, Reva, I'm going now. I'll leave you alone.", "Reva: What, I scare you?", "Jeffrey: No, I just that I know enough is enough.", "Reva: Oh. I bet that's what all the girls say.", "Jeffrey: Yeah. Yeah, that's me. Listen next time I want to pick your brain, I promise I'll call ahead and plan it. I didn't mean to barge in on you when you were so preoccupied.", "Reva: Ah, here, this is yours.", "Jeffrey: You know what? Why don't you hang on to that. You know, I mean I have another copy and who knows...", "Reva: Okay.", "Jeffrey: ...something might come to you concrete, you know?", "Reva: I wish it would.", "Jeffrey: What's that?", "Reva: Nothing. Nothing. Really. I'll let you know if anything comes up. No promises though.", "Jeffrey: No. None asked for.", "Reva: Okay.", "Jeffrey: Goodnight.", "Reva: Goodnight.", "(Phone rings)", "Jeffrey: Yes, Sergeant, what's happening? What's on the blotter tonight besides pizza stains? Shots? Yeah. Who reported them? Got it.", "Reva: I want to help you, I do, but I don't know how. No, don't go. Please don't go.
