{"Episode Summary": [], "Recap": ["In the aftermath of the shooting, Frank arrives at the Fairgrounds. He insists that Buzz be taken to the hospital so that his wound can be treated. Billy and Josh relay their version of the shooting to Frank and Jeffrey. Frank then leads Josh away to the police station. Ed tends to Michelle, Marah and Marina who are all still under the influence of the drugged rings. He takes charge and feeds them the story they'll be selling to the cops; the girls were never at the fairgrounds. When the girls take their rings off, they begin to get more lucid but Marah still doesn't remember what happened in the funhouse. Ed breaks the news that Josh shot Carrie. Marah is stunned and Ed pulls Michelle aside, worried that they can't count on Marah to stick with the story. Later on, Marah answers the door to Jeffrey O'Neill. Alan returns home to find Harley and Gus waiting to ask him questions about Antimonius. Harley gets a call from Frank, informing her about the shooting. When Alan, sticking to the story that he was not there, asks about the shooting, Gus gets the feeling that Alan is hiding something. Gus's suspicions are further fueled when Frank informs him that Alan's car was seen driving away from the fairgrounds tonight. Harley tracks down Buzz who has refused hospital treatment. They share an emotional moment and for the first time in a while, Buzz believes he might be able to give up his past."], "Recap Author": "Megan", "Show Title": "Guiding Light", "Transcript": ["Josh: Let's go over the story again.", "Buzz: We don't have to go over it again. We know what to say.", "Josh: The more we say it, the more we'll begin to believe it's actually what happened.", "Buzz: How pathetic is that?", "Billy: Yeah, it's pretty pathetic, but he's right. Go ahead, Josh.", "Josh: Caroline Caruthers came to me a while back looking for a job at Lewis. I turned her down. She got very angry. She's been harassing me for a while and tonight she lured me to this place.", "Billy: Don't forget that she accosted you the other night at the Country Club.", "Buzz: In front of us.", "Billy: And then she lured you here.", "Josh: Right.", "Billy: And Buzz and Ed and I were nervous about you coming by yourself, so we came with you.", "Josh: And Buzz, you brought the gun, why?", "Buzz: Because the woman's a whack job. We don't know what she's capable of.", "Josh: It's a good thing you did bring that gun because she was also carrying a gun. Now, she played a game of Cat and Mouse with us in here in this maze of mirrors for a while. And then, at one point, she aimed her gun at me, you saw her do that and you took aim at her.", "Buzz: She got to me before I got to her. She winged me. The gun popped out of my hands and went flying.", "Billy: And you picked up the gun and you pointed it at her and you told her to drop her gun, and she didn't, and then you shot once, you missed. You shot a second time and you hit her.", "Buzz: And she fell, went into that hole, went into the water and was swept away by the river.", "Josh: And then I called the police. I asked Ed to go back to town to the Museum to tell Marah and Shayne what had happened before they heard it from someplace else, and if Ed's doing his job right now, the girls will all say that this is the first they have heard of Caroline Caruthers, the first they have heard anything about us being here tonight or what happened here tonight. Right?", "Billy: Right. Buzz?", "Buzz: Right.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ed: Okay, everything's fine, everything's under control. Marah, do you want to sit down or something for a bit?", "Michelle: Dad... when we were at the fairgrounds...", "Ed: Michelle, please wait a minute.", "Michelle: No.", "Ed: Okay, do me a favor.", "Michelle: Look, Marina and I were outside and we heard shots.", "Ed: You didn't hear anything.", "Michelle: Yes. I did. Please, please don't make me feel like I'm crazy.", "Marina: Honestly, Dr. Bauer, we heard gunshots.", "Ed: Okay, now listen to me, everyone. Please. You didn't hear anything, and the reason that you didn't hear anything is that you weren't at the fairgrounds tonight. Do you understand that? None of you were there.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Josh: Just the four of us were here tonight. That's the story we stick with, no matter what. The girls were never here. Alan Spaulding was never here.", "Gus: Alan? Rough night?", "Josh: So we're clear on the details?", "Billy: The problem is not the details, Josh.", "Josh: Okay, Billy. What is the problem?", "Billy: Look, are you 100% sure that you want to go through with this? Because, believe me, once you go down this path, Little Brother, you cannot turn back.", "Josh: I don't see that I have any choice, Billy. I am the reason my daughter ended up in this Godforsaken place tonight. I'm the reason she pulled the trigger. This is the way it has to be.", "(Sirens in the distance)", "Billy: That's it. Okay. You ready?", "Josh: I've had a lot of years to get ready.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Frank: All right. Burgess, you'll stay with me. Kowalski, I want you to go back to the cruiser. I want you to run the plates on that car that passed us going in the opposite direction. The road up here only goes to one place.", "Cop: You got it.", "Frank: Thanks. All right, you ready?", "(Knocking)", "Frank: Josh! It's Frank Cooper. Josh!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Billy: It's show time.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: Dad, okay, I'm confused. What are you trying to do?", "Ed: Don't be confused. Just listen to me, all right? Now, this is important: The first time that any of you heard about any trouble tonight is when I came to that door.", "Michelle: No. No, Dad. We were there. Marah was inside. Marina and I were outside.", "Ed: You weren't there. You weren't there. You were here all night long, together. All of you together. You were watching TV, okay? You were watching The Titanic. That's perfect. The three of you were here, together, all night long, watching The Titanic.", "Marina: But why...?", "Michelle: Why do you want us to lie?", "Ed: I will get to that, all right? Please. You've got to just listen to me. We were the ones who got you in this mess in the first place. We were the ones who were in that car when it went off the bridge. We were the ones who walked away and we tried to protect ourselves. Now, you've got to believe me, now we are trying to protect you.", "Marina: By making us lie?", "Michelle: Yeah, we can't keep secrets like you guys.", "Ed: You have been keeping a secret for months, Michelle, and it's been driving you crazy. Now, this isn't going to hurt anymore. It's not going to hurt. Look, it can be over. It is over, if you just do what I say. Now, do you understand that? Marah? Do you understand anything that I am telling you? Okay, look, honey, this is what you've got to do. You've got to take a shower now, all right? Come on, stand up. Here we go. You've got to get up. I want you... Marina, would you help me out here for a second? I want you to get her into a shower and make sure that she washes her hands. And then I want you to take the clothes that she's wearing now and I want you to put them in the washing machine, all right?", "Marina: Yeah, okay. Okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marah: I don't need a shower.", "Ed: You're going to feel so much better when you do.", "Marah: But I don't need a shower.", "Ed: All right. Marah, do as I say. All of you, if you will just do as I say, everything is going to be fine. Now, come on.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Josh: It's okay, Frank. It's over. You can put your gun away. Okay? It's okay.", "Frank: You shot someone?", "Josh: Yes. Just put your gun away, please. It was a woman. She's dead. It was the person that I told you about, the one who came to me for a job. I turned her down, she got upset and she's been stalking me.", "Billy: Yeah, we thought we could handle it, but obviously we were wrong.", "Josh: It was self-defense, Frank. She lured me here to this place to kill me. She brought a gun with her.", "Billy: He had no choice, Frank. I saw the whole thing.", "Frank: Where is she? Where's her body?", "Josh: She fell down through the trap door there.", "Frank: What?", "Josh: She fell into the river.", "Frank: I need you guys to go down to the river. I need you to search the banks. Look for a body. Now. You said this is her gun?", "Josh: Yes. The one I used is over in the corner right there.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Frank: You own that gun?", "Buzz: It's mine, Frank.", "Frank: Dad? You're shot!", "Buzz: I'm okay, I'm okay.", "Frank: Can you stand up?", "Buzz: Yeah.", "Frank: Can you walk, Pop?", "Buzz: Yeah.", "Frank: Who the hell did this to you? Who shot you?", "Buzz: The woman, you know? I saw her about to shoot Josh and I tried to stop her, but she got me first. It's just a flesh wound.", "Frank: All right, Pop, let me take you outside. I've got an ambulance coming, all right?", "Buzz: I don't want an ambulance, Frank.", "Frank: Dad, listen to me. I'm running this ship, not you. I'm taking my father outside; there's an ambulance coming. When I come back here, I want to find out how all of you ended up here. You understand me? And don't touch anything.", "Jeffrey: Frank, I've got you covered until you get back. You all right?", "(Door closes)", "Frank: Take it easy, Pop, huh? Let's wait in my car while we're waiting for the ambulance.", "(Sirens in the distance)", "Buzz: I'm fine. Oh, God. The fresh air feels good.", "Frank: Come on. Dad, what the hell happened? What are you doing up here? Why are you a part of this?", "Buzz: There was this woman, Frank. This woman showed up at the Country Club at the Valentine's Dance, you know? Ed and Billy and I saw her, for lack of a better word, accost Josh. She was nuts, Frank. She was whacko. She was crazy, making these threats. Josh thought he could calm her down, you know, back her off, so he agreed to meet her here. She was so crazy, we were not about to let him go alone, so we came along, you know? In case things got ugly.", "Frank: You said Ed Bauer was up here. Where is he now?", "Buzz: Oh, he's... Josh sent him into town to tell Marah and Shayne. He didn't want them to hear it from the news or something.", "Frank: Hey, Pop, earlier this evening when I asked you why you had your gun out?", "Buzz: Mm-hmm.", "Frank: You lied to me, didn't you?", "Buzz: Yeah. But only...", "Frank: You had your gun out because you were planning on coming up here and confronting this woman.", "Buzz: Oh, we weren't going to confront anyone, Frank. We were just here to back up Josh. And I had the gun because she might have had a weapon. I mean, I never thought for a second I was going to use it.", "Frank: To bring a loaded gun up here?", "Buzz: As opposed to it being an unloaded gun? It's lucky I had a loaded gun.", "Frank: All I'm saying is that you had four men up here against one woman in the middle of nowhere. Now, if this woman was such a whacko -- enough to bring a loaded gun -- then why didn't you call me or dial 911?", "Buzz: Because we thought we could handle it ourselves.", "Frank: Get over here, will you? This is my father. Please take good care of him. Hey, Pop? I'll talk to you later.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "EMS Worker: This way, Mr. Cooper.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "(Frank dials phone)", "Frank: Harley, it's me.", "Harley: Frank, listen, Gus and I are with Alan. We're kind of in the middle of something. Can I call you back later?", "Frank: Actually, you can't. There's been an incident. Dad's been shot.", "Harley: What? What?", "Frank: He got shot in the arm. It was a grazing. He's in an ambulance right now on the way to Cedars, but I can't leave the crime scene. I need you to meet him there.", "Harley: Okay, yeah. I'm on it. Wait, what happened? Where are you right now?", "Frank: I'm at the fairgrounds. Listen, I don't have the whole story yet, but Josh Lewis, Billy Lewis, Ed Bauer and Dad were all up here, and somehow some crazed stalker woman followed them up here and somehow Daddy got shot, and Josh Lewis ends up killing and shooting the woman dead.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Oh, my... Okay, what do I do? Okay, no, you know what I'll do? I'll go be with Dad and then you just call me when you know something. Okay.", "Gus: What happened?", "Harley: Um, uh... a stalker was after Josh, and Ed Bauer and my dad and Billy Lewis somehow got caught up in the act, and there was a confrontation and my dad was shot. He's fine -- Frank said it's a flesh wound -- but he's on his way to the hospital. The stalker was shot, too. Dead.", "Gus: Was anybody else hurt? So, who shot the stalker? I'm not understanding. Was it your father?", "Harley: I think it was Josh.", "Alan: It was self-defense. That's what it sounds like to me. Self-defense.", "Harley: Well, I think it's a little soon to tell that, Alan. Anyway, I'm going to go be with my dad.", "Gus: I'm coming with you.", "Harley: No, no. You stay here. I'll just... I'll call you when I know something.", "Gus: Are you sure? I'll go with...", "Harley: No.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ed: So, Marina, did you put her clothes in the wash?", "Marina: Yeah.", "Ed: Sit down. So, how are you feeling now? Feeling any better? Honey, look, I know that you're confused and you're probably frightened, but you've got to snap out of it now. Your pupils are dilated. All three of you girls, your pupils are dilated. Are you on some kind of a drug?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: So you said that this woman had been harassing you for a while, Josh?", "Josh: Yes. Yeah. She... I'm sorry, she came to me for a preliminary job interview a while back. I turned her down, she got very, very upset about it and began stalking me. Frank, I told you about this at the Valentine's Dance.", "Frank: Yeah, well, you also told me that you'd worked things out.", "Josh: I thought we had.", "Jeffrey: Well, if she had been harassing you for a while, then I'm sure you must have some record of your dealings with her. You know, phone messages, notes, that sort of thing.", "Josh: Yes.", "Jeffrey: Okay, good. We'll need to see those, of course.", "Josh: That's fine.", "Frank: All right, Josh, who was she? The victim. You didn't tell us her name. What is her name?", "Josh: Oh. I'm sorry. Caruthers. Her name was Caroline Caruthers.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: You know, give me one of those. I've got to tell you that this stuff is going to hit the fan when the story gets out that a Bauer and two Lewises and a Cooper are all involved with the shooting. It's just lucky for us the Spaulding name isn't in the mix. They'd have a field day, the press.", "Alan: So, Harley says it was a stalker, huh? Yeah, those people are capable of anything. Listen, I'm certain that Josh's life must have been threatened for him to pull the trigger.", "Gus: Yeah, I guess.", "Alan: Yeah, because I know him. He's... he's a man who's very calm under pressure. I'm not a fan of his, but he's very calm. Was she armed?", "Gus: Who?", "Alan: The stalker. You know, you can get guns very easily these days. I'm surprised she was stalking Josh. You would think that she would have gone after Reva. I mean, with that psychic TV show that Reva has. I mean, it brings out all the nuts. Not that I'm not sympathetic to the lady. I mean, after all, we've had some psychiatric challenges in our family lately.", "Gus: Yeah, I don't know. Alan, why do you keep saying \"she?\" I mean, Harley never mentioned that it was a woman.", "Alan: She didn't? Well, I guess that's just the way my mind works. I just assumed that the stalker of Josh would be a female.", "Gus: Yeah, that makes sense.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Frank: So, are you okay with that?", "Jeffrey: Yeah, separate. Definitely the way to go.", "Frank: All right. All right, Billy, why don't we go outside and get some fresh air here, so I can get a statement from you, okay?", "Jeffrey: Josh, I'll take yours in here.", "Billy: Frank, are you sure you don't want me to stay in here. I mean, things happened pretty fast. Two heads are often better than one.", "Frank: Hey, Billy? This is the way we want to do it, all right?", "Billy: You're the boss.", "(Door closes)", "Jeffrey: I guess we just start at the top. Now, you say that Ms. Caruthers was here when you got here. Is that right?", "Josh: Yes, she was. She was wearing a long, black cape. She looked very strange. She was acting very strange, taunting us, hiding amongst the mirrors.", "Billy: The way she was acting, Frank. I mean, I knew right from the get-go there was going to be trouble. And then she pulls out a gun.", "Jeffrey: This gun?", "Josh: The woman was deranged. She wasn't just trying to scare me. She meant business.", "Frank: So there were four of you and only one of her. You guys couldn't figure out some other way to subdue her?", "Billy: Frank, there wasn't any time. I mean, with all those mirrors, before we could get our bearings, she had her gun out and she had it pointed at Josh and she would have shot him, too, if your dad hadn't pulled out his gun.", "Josh: And that would have been me down there instead of her.", "Jeffrey: Josh, I need you to show me exactly what happened when the guns started going off, okay? If you could, like, act it out for me? Show me exactly where everyone was standing and what they were doing when they were there. Okay? We'll start with you and Ms. Caruthers. Now where were you, exactly, when she was aiming the gun at you?", "Josh: Well, we were both right here. She was where you are. We were struggling for a bit and then she pointed her gun at me. Buzz was down there.", "Jeffrey: Josh, show me.", "Josh: Okay. Buzz was here. He had his gun raised, he was ready to shoot, but she was able to fire at him first, before he had a chance.", "Jeffrey: She must have been pretty quick to outdraw Buzz.", "Josh: She was.", "Billy: She winged your dad and the gun flew out and skittered, oh, about right here.", "Josh: Buzz's gun went sliding across the floor, all the way to here. In the meantime, I had backed away from Carrie. So I just scooped up the gun here. I backed away from her and I said, \"Drop your gun.\" And she wouldn't do it. And then I hit this pole and that caused me to fire wide and that's when I broke this mirror here.", "Jeffrey: Then what?", "Josh: I fired again.", "(Gunshot)", "Josh: And this time I hit her, and she went down.", "Billy: Frank, if Josh had waited another second, one of us definitely would have gotten shot.", "Frank: So exactly what were you doing, Billy, while all this was happening?", "Billy: Well, nothing. There wasn't any time.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cop: Mr. O'Neill? We found this caught in the mouth of the culvert. There's blood on it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: You recognize that?", "Josh: Yeah. That's the cape that she was wearing. It must have snagged on something when she was...", "Jeffrey: Okay, number it and bag it. Thanks. Pretty weird, this Caruthers lady. A freaking cape? That's pretty gothic. Josh, are you sure that you never set eyes on this woman before she came into your office for that interview?", "Josh: Yes, I'm sure.", "Jeffrey: Okay. I've got to go talk to Frank. I want you to stay here, if you don't mind.", "Josh: Okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ed: Marah, are you sure you didn't take anything tonight?", "Marah: I don't do drugs.", "Marina: None of us do.", "Ed: All right, maybe something over-the-counter. Maybe you ate something or drank something?", "Michelle: Dad, Marah's in shock. We all are. Tonight was horrible.", "Ed: Look, something more is going on here. I mean, I feel like I want to run a blood test. Marah, tell me exactly what you remember happening tonight.", "Marah: Nothing.", "Ed: Nothing? You're sure?", "Marah: No. I... I was getting ready to meet Carrie at the fairgrounds.", "Ed: All right, go on. Go on.", "Marah: I put on my ring.", "Ed: Ring. You put on your ring? What ring?", "Marina: Her scarab ring. We all have them. See?", "Michelle: Yeah, well, not anymore. I hate these stupid things. I don't know about you guys, but I'm never wearing mine again.", "Marina: Me, neither.", "Michelle: Marah? Do you still want yours?", "Marah: No, I don't think so. Here.", "Michelle: Good riddance.", "Ed: Michelle, please. Enough with the rings, all right? We have to focus here. I'm trying to get you people to understand something.", "Michelle: Yeah, but, Dad, we don't understand, okay? We don't understand anything. Maybe Marah doesn't remember being at the fun house, but I do. And I don't understand why you want us to lie.", "Marina: Just tell us the truth.", "Ed: All right, you want the truth? Here it is. Carrie was trying to kill Josh. Carrie wanted to kill your father, Marah. She had a gun. And luckily, Buzz had a gun, too, and he trained it on her, but she shot him first, in the arm.", "Marina: She shot my grandfather?", "Ed: He's fine. I checked him out. Please believe me. Everything is all right. But he dropped the gun. Josh picked it up and... The point is that none of us have to worry about Caroline Caruthers any more. She is out of the picture.", "Michelle: Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean, \"out of the picture\"?", "Ed: I mean that she's gone. Josh took care of her.", "Marina: Oh, my God. Josh...", "Ed: Josh shot her. She's dead.", "Marah: No. No, no, no. Dad didn't shoot anybody. Well, he didn't. No. No, my dad didn't shoot Carrie.", "Ed: Honey, he had to. She was trying to kill him -- all of us. He saved everybody.", "Marah: I... I think that I was there.", "Ed: You weren't there. You were here.", "Michelle: Dad, stop. You're making it worse, though.", "Ed: You were here all night, remember? You were watching the tube, you were watching The Titanic , remember?", "Marah: No.", "Ed: Yes, you were, honey. You were here all night with these two. And then I came and I told you that your dad was involved in a shooting.", "Michelle: You want us to cover for you.", "Ed: Look, damn it, Michelle, what purpose does it serve for the police to know that you were there? It just confuses everything and it causes a lot of people pain. Now, there's been enough pain already. Enough.", "Marah: So, I was here?", "Ed: All night.", "Marah: I don't... I don't understand.", "Michelle: It's okay, all right? It's okay if you don't remember anything because if anyone knew we were there, it would just make things worse. Okay? My dad is right.", "Ed: Thank you.", "Michelle: We weren't there. Okay?", "Marina: I don't know if I can do this.", "Ed: You can and you will.", "Michelle: Look, we all can do it. All we have to do is just remember what my dad told us. That's all. Okay?", "Ed: Marah, did you hear what Michelle just said? I mean, please, just nod if you heard. Do you understand what she said? Okay, look, let's do it this way. You tell us what happened tonight. Tell us what happened.", "Marah: I was here with Michelle and Marina. And... and you told me my dad shot somebody, and she's dead. Right?", "Ed: All right. Very good. Perfect.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Billy: You okay?", "Josh: You?", "Billy: Yeah. Just told it like it happened.", "Josh: Me, too.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: Looks like their statements match up.", "Frank: Yeah, same with my dad's. But we also know that the victim's gun was fired.", "Jeffrey: Looks like self-defense, but run it by the book anyway, okay?", "Frank: It's the only way.", "Jeffrey: Listen, I've got something I've got to do in town. You'll walk me to the door? I'll catch up with you later at the station. Gentlemen, thank you very much and thanks for your cooperation. We need to talk to your dad and Dr. Bauer, ASAP.", "Frank: Yeah, well, until then, we've got to keep Josh completely away from them.", "Jeffrey: Exactly. Do what you've got to do.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cop: Hey, Chief.", "Frank: What have you got?", "Cop: The name on those plates you asked me to run.", "Frank: Thank you. Let's just see who was driving away from this place.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Dad? Daddy, what are you doing here? You're supposed to be in the hospital.", "Buzz: They treated me in the ambulance. Would you rather I spent the night in a miserable hospital room?", "Harley: Yes. Yes, I would. You were shot.", "Buzz: I've been through worse.", "Harley: Dad, come on. I'm taking you back to the...", "Buzz: No hospital. No hospital.", "Harley: Does it hurt? Well, really, Dad. I mean, are you at least going to tell me what happened?", "Buzz: Sounds like Frank gave you the highlights. I got jammed up helping a friend.", "Harley: \"Jammed up.\" There's a euphemism. You were shot and a woman is dead.", "Buzz: \"Dead and gone, dead and gone. Lucky me. Life goes on.\" We used to say that every day we lived another day in 'Nam. Lucky me.", "Harley: Well, you're all right. You know, that's the important thing. You're all right.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "(Phone rings)", "Frank: Gus?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: No, I was with Harley when you called before and she should probably be at the hospital by now. Yeah, what's... Well, that's interesting. Yeah, I could do that. Yeah, I'll be in touch. Alan? Al?", "Alan: Yeah? Here's your drink.", "Gus: Yeah, thanks. So, what were you doing at the fairgrounds tonight?", "Alan: Fairgrounds?", "Gus: Well, the cops saw your car headed back to town. You know, that's the same location that the shooting took place. That's a coincidence, huh?", "Alan: The old fairgrounds, huh? That's where the shooting took place? Because that's really strange. I didn't hear or see anything out of the ordinary when I was out there.", "Gus: Oh, so you were out there tonight.", "Alan: Yeah. Yeah, I'm very interested in some property out there, developing for commercial or residential use along the river there.", "Gus: Hm. Well, that is a hell of a coincidence, isn't it? That you'd be looking at a piece of land, the exact piece of land where the shooting took place, at the exact same time that Josh and Buzz are there, and the rest of your friends.", "Alan: I would hardly call those men my friends.", "Gus: But you do that? You look at property that late at night, in the dark?", "Alan: Yes, if I'm interested in it. I check my property out in a quiet time. I don't want them to see me out there, because if they do, the price goes up. That's why I look at the property at night.", "Gus: Oh. Well, that would explain it, right? You know what I'll do? I'll tell Frank not to bother questioning you, because... But like I said before, the Spaulding name gets out there into the press, they're just going to have a field day.", "Alan: It's your name, too. Don't you ever forget it, Gus.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Tonight must have been really rough for you. It sounds like being in a life-and-death situation brought back a lot of memories. Vietnam?", "Buzz: Memories, yeah. Tell me something: Do you think you can be forgiven for something you did that was wrong, even if it was so long ago that you couldn't possibly make up for that mistake?", "Harley: Depends on what the mistake was. Certainly the bigger question is whether you can forgive yourself for it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ed: Look, you understand that all three of you have to stick to the same story, right?", "Michelle: Yes, Dad. I get it.", "Ed: I mean, it's not you and Marina I'm worried about, it's Marah. She doesn't remember what happened now because she's in shock, but she's going to come out of it.", "Michelle: And who knows what she's going to say?", "Ed: You're going to have to keep your eye on her.", "Michelle: I will, I promise. But I hate this.", "(Knocking at door)", "Marina: Hey, I'll...", "Ed: No, no.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Frank: You just go ahead with that, all right?", "Billy: Frank, you all done with us?", "Frank: For now.", "Billy: Good. Well, Josh and I are going to go. If you want us, we can...", "Frank: Actually, Billy, you can go. I'll have to take Josh down to the station.", "Billy: Why?", "Josh: It's okay, Billy.", "Frank: Because a woman's dead.", "Billy: Yeah, but it was self-defense.", "Frank: The woman's still dead and Josh admitted to the shooting.", "Josh: We understand, Frank.", "Billy: Well, I'm not quite sure I understand.", "Josh: We understand, Frank. You're just doing your job.", "Frank: Speaking of this, Josh, it's a standard procedure. Joshua Lewis, you're under arrest for the murder of Caroline Caruthers. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. Do you understand?", "Josh: Yes.", "Frank: You have the right to an attorney during questioning. Do you understand?", "Josh: Call Ross.", "Billy: Yeah, I will.", "Frank: If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you by the courts. Do you understand?", "Josh: Yes, I do.", "Frank: Do you understand these rights as I've read them to you, Josh?", "Josh: Call Reva.", "Billy: I'll call Reva.
