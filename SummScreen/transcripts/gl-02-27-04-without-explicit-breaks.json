        "Billy breaks the news to Reva that Josh has been arrested. She rushes to the police station to be by his side. Josh continues to stick to his story, determined to protect Marah at all costs. Even when Reva senses there's something he's not telling her, Josh won't betray his daughter. Marah is still feeling the effects of the drug that Carrie gave her. Michelle and Marina are coming out of it but the added shock of learning of Josh's arrest has sent Marah into a tailspin. Jeffrey arrives and does his best to comfort Marah. But he is also the DA and has to question her about the night of the shooting. Alone with Marah, Jeffrey is both loving and persistent and she almost recalls the moment when she pulled the trigger. But the moment passes and Ed and Jeffrey agree to take Marah to Cedars. Jeffrey cannot bail on his pursuit of justice and places a phone call to Frank, ensuring that Josh will remain behind bars overnight. Marina returns to Company, where Alex is doing her best to comfort Buzz. It's an emotional reunion for Marina as she is able to tell her grandpa how much she regrets putting her faith in Carrie. Shayne arrives, confused and upset that he's not allowed to visit Josh at the police station. Marina fears Shayne is going to start digging into what happened at the fairgrounds and tries to dissuade him. When Michelle returns home and tells Danny what happened to Josh, Danny recalls seeing Josh, Billy, Buzz, Ed and Alan together at the Valentine's dance. Danny's instincts kick in and he smells some kind of conspiracy, which Michelle instantly squashes. All she wants is to be with her family and she ends the evening with Robbie in her arms."

        "Reva: Billy.",
        "Billy: Sorry, darling, I didn't mean to scare you.",
        "Reva: That's okay. I'm glad you're here. I could use the company, actually. I couldn't sleep.",
        "Billy: Look, Reva...",
        "Reva: What is it?",
        "Billy: Why don't you and I sit down for a sec, okay?",
        "Reva: Tell me what it is.",
        "Billy: It... it's Josh.",
        "Reva: What about him, Billy?",
        "Billy: No, no, no, no. He's okay. It's just there was a shooting tonight, and somebody was killed.",
        "Reva: Someone we know?",
        "Billy: No, no.",
        "Reva: Where's Josh? Why isn't he here?",
        "Billy: That's just it, darling. He... Josh is the one that pulled the trigger.",
        "Policeman: I'll take it from here, Chief.",
        "Frank: Hey, Sarge, this is Josh Lewis. He's confessed to shooting and killing Caroline Caruthers, but he's also agreed to cooperate fully, so he's going to need a complete workup.",
        "Policeman: Got it.",
        "Josh: Listen, Frank, I'm not looking for any special treatment here, okay?",
        "Frank: Hey, Josh, you help us and we'll help you. A woman was killed tonight and in your statement you said it was self-defense. It was either her life or yours. Now, if there's something you want to add to your statement, now's the time.",
        "(Gunshot)",
        "Frank: Josh?",
        "Josh: Umm... nothing to add, no. I... I shot her. I had no choice.",
        "Jeffrey: Dr. Bauer, I'd like to come in. I want to see Marah.",
        "Ed: No, actually, it's not a good time. She needs her rest. She's had a shock tonight and she's very upset about her dad.",
        "Jeffrey: I understand. I'll be careful.",
        "Ed: Okay. A short time.",
        "Jeffrey: Thanks.",
        "Marah: Jeffrey?",
        "Jeffrey: Hi. Are you all right?",
        "Marah: My dad, they're saying...",
        "Michelle: Shh, Marah, Marah, everything's okay. It's okay.",
        "Jeffrey: That's right, Marah, everything's okay. You don't have to talk about your dad if you don't want to.",
        "Marah: No, I do. You can help him. My dad didn't kill anybody, I know that he didn't.",
        "Jeffrey: What do you mean, Marah? How do you know your dad didn't shoot someone?",
        "Marah: Because I know... I know my dad, and I know the kind of person he is. He... he wouldn't kill anybody. He didn't.",
        "Michelle: What Marah means is that Josh would never shoot anyone in cold blood.",
        "Marina: It was self-defense.",
        "Jeffrey: How would you know that unless you were there?",
        "Ed: Because I was there and I told them what happened. I mean, kind of understandably, Josh didn't want Marah or Shayne to find out about this watching the TV, so he asked me to come over here and tell them what happened.",
        "Jeffrey: Do you mind if I talk to Marah alone for a minute, all of you?",
        "Ed: She needs her rest.",
        "Michelle: Dad, Dad, it's okay. He's not going to upset her. Maybe he'd help, you know?",
        "Jeffrey: Thanks. You don't look too good. Are you okay? Can I do something to help.",
        "Marah: I'm just... I'm so cold.",
        "Jeffrey: God, your hands are like ice. Here.",
        "Marah: I don't think I'm ever going to be warm again.",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, you are. You're going to be warm, you're going to be fine. Come on. Sit down. You're going to be okay.",
        "Marah: How could this happen?",
        "Jeffrey: Hey, you know, sometimes... sometimes people are faced with decisions, Marah, tough decisions, decisions that change their life. I have a lot of respect for your dad and I promise you, I am going to help him, okay?",
        "Marah: You'll help him?",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, I will, if I can. Hey, you know, this is me. You can tell me anything, you know that.",
        "Ed: This is about the last thing we needed to happen. I mean, Marah is still in shock. I don't even know if she understand what she's supposed to be saying or not and the district attorney walks in.",
        "Michelle: I'm sorry, Dad.",
        "Ed: Maybe you girls should get out of here, too. Can you get home?",
        "Michelle: Dad, did something else happen at the fun house that you're not telling us?",
        "Ed: I told you everything that happened. The important thing is that everything will be fine if you just listen to what I told you and go home to Danny, okay?",
        "Michelle: Okay.",
        "Ed: Are you going to be all right? I mean, where are you going to go now?",
        "Marina: I've got to see my grandpa tonight or I'm not going to be able to sleep.",
        "Buzz: Would you get out of here already?",
        "Waitress: Only you would bust out of ER to close up. You're a tough guy, Buzz.",
        "Buzz: And don't you forget it. Go home, feed your dog.",
        "Waitress: Cat. And you have as many lives as one.",
        "(Kiss)",
        "Buzz: What was that for?",
        "Waitress: You're a good guy, Buzz Cooper.",
        "Buzz: Hi.",
        "Alexandra: So you're one of the good guys, huh?",
        "Buzz: Look, I couldn't tell you the whole story...",
        "Alexandra: You almost get yourself killed and I don't even rate a phone call, huh?",
        "Buzz: I was going to call you.",
        "Alexandra: I have to hear on the news that you've been shot. You've been shot! You have been shot and then I run over to ER and you're not there.",
        "Buzz: I didn't...",
        "Alexandra: No, no! I thought... I thought I almost lost you, and you... and you...",
        "Buzz: I'm here. You're stuck with me.",
        "(Kiss)",
        "Alexandra: And you're an idiot. I'll teach you.",
        "(Kiss)",
        "Frank: All right, Josh, we're all done.",
        "Josh: Good.",
        "Frank: Hey, listen, the fact that you came forward voluntarily and submitted to all the tests will look very good in the eyes of the judge, if this ever comes to trial.",
        "Josh: Look, I'm not trying to score any points here, Frank, all right? I just want to pay my dues.",
        "Frank: I understand that. You know, most guys, Josh, they do their damnedest to talk their way out of here, but you make it sound like you're planning on a very long stay.",
        "Josh: I know what I'm doing, Frank.",
        "Ross: Frank, what's going on? What have you been doing?",
        "Frank: Josh gave a statement and we just finished fingerprinting him.",
        "Ross: I need a moment with my client, okay?",
        "Frank: Sure. You can use the interrogation room.",
        "Ross: Thanks. Let's go.",
        "Josh: Thank you for getting here so quick.",
        "Ross: Did Frank read you your rights?",
        "Josh: Yes, of course he did.",
        "Ross: Did anything ring a bell, such as \"you have the right to remain silent?\" \"Anything you say can and will be used against you?\" You've already said too much, Josh, to the wrong people. I'm your attorney. I haven't even heard the full story. What are you thinking about?",
        "Josh: Ross, Ross, I called you here because you're the family lawyer, right? I wanted to make sure that Reva and the kids are taken care of.",
        "Ross: If you wanted to help your family, put your energy towards getting out of here, which means putting yourself in my hands. You don't say a word unless I tell you to. You don't make a move unless I tell you to make it. There's going to be one voice coming from your defense, and it's going to be mine. That's how you can help your family. Are we clear?",
        "Josh: I have to take responsibility for this. I want to plead guilty. I want to accept whatever punishment is due. I want to exercise my right to a speedy trial because I think it will be better for everybody involved.",
        "Ross: You know something? You going to jail, that's not good for anybody. Now, if this incident, this shooting happened the way you describe it, it's a defensible act, morally and legally. And there's a chance, a small chance, Josh, that I can take it and make it all go away.",
        "Josh: But that's not what I'm asking you to do.",
        "Ross: Before we go any further, I need to know why a man who has everything to live for is railroading himself into a conviction. You can...",
        "Reva: Josh...",
        "Ross: We're not...",
        "Reva: Joshua.",
        "Michelle: Did you hear that?",
        "Marina: Yeah. Yeah, it's... sounds like shots, yes. Carrie had a gun.",
        "Michelle: No, Buzz had a gun, too. They're shooting.",
        "Marina: We've got to get back in there.",
        "Michelle: Dad! No, Dad, we were there, Marah was inside.",
        "Ed: You weren't there. You weren't there. You were here, in here, all night long.",
        "Danny: Hey, hi. I didn't hear you come in.",
        "Michelle: Hey.",
        "Danny: How was girl's night out?",
        "Michelle: It was more like girls night in. We...",
        "Danny: What? Hey, what? What's the matter. Tell me.",
        "Michelle: There was a shooting tonight, Danny.",
        "Danny: What? Are you okay?",
        "Michelle: I'm fine. I wasn't the target.",
        "Danny: Where? Where? Where did this happen?",
        "Michelle: It was Josh Lewis and it was self-defense. He shot someone.",
        "Danny: Was it a robbery or what?",
        "Michelle: Apparently somebody had been stalking him, a woman.",
        "Danny: Okay. How's Marah?",
        "Michelle: She's a mess.",
        "Danny: Oh, God, when I looked at your face, I... For a minute there, I thought something happened to you. Thank God you're okay.",
        "Alexandra: Freeze, please. I mean it, put that down. Just put it down. No more, please. Let me take care of you.",
        "Buzz: If you insist. I've got a bottle of the good stuff behind the bar there.",
        "Alexandra: Well, that's lovely. I think some chamomile tea is a better mix with the painkillers. Don't you think?",
        "Buzz: I don't think you're going to get me to talk with tea.",
        "Alexandra: Yes, I do. I do. Come on, relax. Sit down.",
        "Buzz: Okay.",
        "Alexandra: Sit down, because you look... I don't give a damn about the facts, the evidence, the finger-pointing. Whatever happened out there tonight, whatever happened, I know you did the right thing, because I know you.",
        "Buzz: You don't know that.",
        "Alexandra: I do.",
        "Buzz: With no questions asked?",
        "Alexandra: I don't have any questions about what kind of a man you are. Come on, Buzz. I know you'd never deliberately hurt anyone. (Laughs) I also know the flip side to that, a person can be pushed beyond the limit, way beyond the limit and wake up some time wondering where the devil they're at.",
        "Buzz: We're not talking about tonight anymore, are we?",
        "Alexandra: Okay, no. When I was in Europe, and since I came back, I've done some things, things I'd like to take back.",
        "Buzz: I don't give a damn about evidence, facts, and finger-pointing. I care about you.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, Buzz, come on. We're so simple, aren't we? All we really want is some place to go where somebody's simply happy to see us. You've always been that place for me. No matter how I've messed up, and royally. So, my turn.",
        "Marina: Grandpa!",
        "Josh: You weren't supposed to bring her here, Billy.",
        "Billy: Like I had a choice, Josh.",
        "Reva: Joshua, so there was a shooting. You were defending yourself.",
        "Ross: I've been trying to talk some sense into him. He needs to focus on his defense, Reva.",
        "Reva: Well, he's innocent. It was an accident. Somehow a gun went off.",
        "Josh: Reva, a woman is dead and I'm responsible.",
        "Reva: I don't understand.",
        "Josh: This woman came to me a while back at Lewis, wanted a job and I turned her down. She got very upset, very angry. She started coming after me, you know, stalking... stalking me. She showed up at places that... She was at the Valentine's Dance.",
        "Reva: She's the one who cut in on us; it was her.",
        "Josh: Yes.",
        "Reva: Why haven't you told me about this before now?",
        "Josh: Because I didn't want this to touch you or the kids.",
        "Reva: Marah and Shayne, I'm going to have to find them...",
        "Josh: Ed's taken care of them.",
        "Reva: Ed? Ed Bauer, why?",
        "Billy: He's a doctor. He's a doctor, sweetie. He knows how to break bad news.",
        "Reva: Can I speak to him alone for a minute, please? Okay. It's just you and me now. Just us. I want the truth. I want to know what really happened tonight.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm here. I'm here now, okay? It's going to be okay. So you were with Michelle and Marina all night?",
        "Marah: My friends.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, your friends. It's good to have friends like that, isn't it? People you can trust.",
        "Marah: Ed Bauer, he's... he's a good man.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah.",
        "Marah: Like my father.",
        "Jeffrey: Like your father. Your father's a good man, Marah.",
        "Marah: Then how could you believe that he would kill somebody?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, he said it was self-defense, right? And, Marah, good men will do whatever they have to do to protect themselves and especially to protect the ones they love.",
        "Marah: But my... my dad doesn't even own a gun.",
        "Jeffrey: No, it was Buzz's gun.",
        "Marah: Buzz?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. Buzz Cooper, he was shot in the arm tonight.",
        "Marah: And my... but my dad wouldn't shoot Buzz.",
        "Jeffrey: No, your dad didn't shoot Buzz. A woman shot Buzz, a woman by the name of Carrie.",
        "Marah: Carrie?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. Josh picked up the gun. Marah, Marah, what are you doing? Are you all right? Did you take something? Did Ed give you something, a sedative or something?",
        "Marah: No. Something awful happened tonight. Something awful.",
        "Jeffrey: Marah, look, it's going to be okay. Listen to me, all right? I will take care of it.",
        "Marah: No, no, you can't. No one can. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: What is it? What is it? What?",
        "Marah: I think...",
        "Jeffrey: What?",
        "Marah: I think",
        "Ed: Okay, that's it. That's enough.",
        "Danny: Here you go.",
        "Michelle: Thanks.",
        "Danny: Honey, hey, I know that Marah's your friend, and she's upset right now, but believe me, Josh the going to be fine. He had all those guys there to back up his story, Billy and Buzz, your dad. They're all going to say it was self- defense, right?",
        "Michelle: This woman was crazy, Danny. Josh had no choice.",
        "Danny: Did you know her?",
        "Michelle: No. I'm just saying that anybody that would go after Josh or his family has to be crazy.",
        "Danny: Right. But why did they meet her at all? Why didn't they just go to the police?",
        "Michelle: I guess they wanted to take care of it themselves.",
        "Danny: So the four of them arranged a date with a crazy woman at the abandoned fairgrounds? Honey, you've got to admit, that's a little weird. And I can understand Billy being there, but Buzz and your dad? Why go out there just to confront this woman?",
        "Michelle: I don't know, Danny. I guess you just call it friendship, right?",
        "Danny: Are they that close?",
        "Michelle: Well, they've been in each other's lives forever. Billy is my dad's AA sponsor. Buzz helped Billy get off his feet when he got out of jail. Josh, everybody likes Josh, right?",
        "Danny: What about Alan Spaulding?",
        "Michelle: What do you mean Alan? I didn't say anything about Alan being there.",
        "Danny: No, but I saw him in a huddle with the other guys at our Valentine's Day Benefit. They all looked pretty chummy.",
        "Michelle: What are you implying? Do you think these guys... Are you saying it's something that's premeditated, or what?",
        "Danny: I'm not implying anything, but you have to admit, come on, it's a pretty odd group.",
        "Michelle: Oh, my God, when are you going to stop?",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Michelle: Not every accident is a hit, Danny. Not every stranger is an enemy. We're not living in an Oliver Stone movie. Accidents can be accidents. Sometimes things happen and there's nothing you can do about it.",
        "Marina: Hey, are you okay?",
        "Buzz: I'm getting there.",
        "Marina: You know, you should really be at the hospital.",
        "Buzz: I'm not an invalid, dear.",
        "Marina: You risked your life to protect people that you care about.",
        "Buzz: Come on, now.",
        "Marina: You didn't tell her?",
        "Alexandra: What? What?",
        "Marina: You know, Dr. Bauer told us the whole story. Dr. Bauer and Grandpa went with Josh and Billy to confront this crazy woman who had been stalking Josh, and Grandpa had a gun. And he took a bullet before...",
        "Buzz: She backed Josh into a corner. Luckily he grabbed the gun and shot her in self-defense. You know, maybe I if I hadn't been a cop, maybe no one would have been hurt. Maybe he wouldn't be in lockup.",
        "Alexandra: It sounds like all of you are just lucky to be alive at all, right? Yes? I mean, if you hadn't had the gun, I mean, Josh would have... You, too, you would have got...",
        "Buzz: Enough. Enough. Okay?",
        "Alexandra: Keep an eye on your grandfather, will you? I'm going to go in the kitchen for a while.",
        "Buzz: You're going to what?",
        "Alexandra: You need to keep up your strength. I'm going to go into the kitchen.",
        "Buzz: You're going to cook for me?",
        "Alexandra: Well, don't get your hopes up. I make one dish, it's an Omelette Gruyere. You could have an Omelette Double Gruyere.",
        "Buzz: Well, it will take a minute to decide.",
        "Alexandra: You don't have long.",
        "Marina: You know, I totally called that.",
        "Buzz: What?",
        "Alexandra: You and Alexandra, and she's cooking for you, now. That's a pretty big deal. And, you know, no matter how bad that omelette is, you pretend it's the best thing you've ever tasted in your life.",
        "Buzz: Gee, thanks for the tip. What?",
        "Marina: You know, I have always had two heroes in my life: You and Dad. Dad because he's basically the best person in the world and he can do absolutely to wrong. And you because no matter how bad things get, you never stop trying to make them right. And I know I can never be like Dad -- I'm not that pure -- but maybe I could be like you.",
        "Buzz: You're more like your Dad than you think.",
        "Marina: If I hadn't trusted Carrie over you, none of this would ever have happened and I am so sorry.",
        "Buzz: She would have tracked us with or without you girls. She was going to have her judgment day.",
        "Marina: I just... I feel like I failed you.",
        "Buzz: Never. God! You are such a brilliant person. You are. And you've got a big heart. And you believe in people. She used that to prey on you. You're great. I just wish Josh didn't have to pay the price for this.",
        "Reva: Is it blackmail? Is Billy in some kind of trouble?",
        "Josh: Nothing like that.",
        "Reva: Because this didn't just start tonight. You've been carrying something around with you for months now.",
        "Josh: I told you what happened, Reva.",
        "Reva: Right. Some crazy lady went on a rampage and you agreed to meet her out in the middle of nowhere with your brother, Ed Bauer...",
        "Josh: Yes.",
        "Reva: ...Buzz Cooper.",
        "Josh: Yes, that's the story. You have to believe me, okay?",
        "Reva: And you have to trust me. I don't care what story you tell the rest of the world, but I want to know the truth. Damn it, Joshua, I want the truth!",
        "Josh: It's done, Reva, it's over.",
        "Reva: So, what? You're just giving up? We wave good-bye to each other?",
        "Josh: No. I am not giving up, Reva, I'm trying to do the right thing here.",
        "Reva: Leaving me alone with the kids. What, is it my turn?",
        "Josh: I'm trying to do what's best for us and our family. I have to pay my debt.",
        "Reva: No. No, you don't.",
        "Josh: And you have to take care of yourself and the kids.",
        "Reva: That's what I'm trying to do.",
        "Josh: Because I can't do that anymore. I won't be able to do it anymore. Besides, Reva, I haven't really done have a very good job lately anyway, have I? I killed a woman. I pulled the trigger, ended a life, Reva. Now, that... that goes against everything I've been trying to teach our children. Everything about turning the other cheek and how... how is Marah supposed to reconcile what I've been teaching her with what happened tonight?",
        "Reva: Marah has seen enough in this world to know that things happen sometimes that we don't have any control over.",
        "Josh: Listen...",
        "Reva: We love you.",
        "Josh: Listen...",
        "Reva: We love you and nothing is going to change that.",
        "Josh: Listen to me. Don't leave Marah alone now, okay?",
        "Reva: Marah and Shayne can take care of each other, Joshua. What is it?",
        "Frank: Hi, Reva. Time's up.",
        "Ed: What do you say? Time to go. I mean, it's pretty obvious she needs her rest.",
        "Jeffrey: Just a minute, Doctor. She's trying to tell me something. Marah, hey.",
        "Marah: It's like I'm close to something, but it keeps moving away from me.",
        "Ed: See, the sedative I gave her is kicking in now, so...",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that's funny, because she told me you didn't give her anything.",
        "Ed: The girl is in a state of shock. Her father shot and killed a woman tonight. I mean, the very idea that he could take a life, any life, even in self-defense, can you understand that it sort of turns her world upside down? I mean, you can get that, don't you? You being here doesn't help.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, I want to help. I want to help and I'm going to help. As a matter of fact, that's why I want her to go to Cedars Hospital to see another doctor, okay? Preferably a doctor who hasn't been under some sort of trauma himself tonight, if you don't mind.",
        "Ed: That's not necessary.",
        "Jeffrey: What's the problem?",
        "Ed: Fine, I'll go with you.",
        "Jeffrey: You'll go? Okay. What, you don't trust me?",
        "Ed: I don't know you well enough to answer that.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that makes us even.",
        "Danny: Michelle, listen, hey, I don't want to upset you, but as Marah's friend, don't you want to know what really happened tonight?",
        "Michelle: I already know what happened, Danny. Josh got backed into a corner and he did something drastic. You've been there.",
        "Danny: Yeah, I have.",
        "Michelle: You know, I'm just glad that it wasn't my father.",
        "Danny: What do you mean?",
        "Michelle: My dad has been very edgy lately. If she had confronted him, you know, he could have snapped.",
        "Danny: Well, maybe tonight was a wakeup call for your father. I don't know. He helped Josh, he took care of Marah. Maybe the Ed Bauer that you know and love is on his way back.",
        "Michelle: I'd really like to believe that.",
        "Danny: I tell you what, wait here; I'll be right back. I know what you need right now.",
        "Alexandra: Vo\u00edla.",
        "Buzz: Wow, it looks so perfect, I don't want to mess with it up, here.",
        "Alexandra: Don't talk, eat.",
        "Buzz: Okay. Perfect.",
        "Alexandra: Really?",
        "Buzz: We could use another hand in the kitchen.",
        "Alexandra: Well, I don't think so. Besides, remember, that's my only dish. Besides, I like my day job.",
        "Buzz: Well, you can compromise. You know, you could just make it for me.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, well in that case, I would need something in return.",
        "Marina: Okay, I think we're headed for too much information here.",
        "Alexandra: Okay, let me tell you something, because your cowboy days are over. Will you promise me you'll never carry a gun again?",
        "Marina: Yeah, promise me, too.",
        "Buzz: You got it.",
        "Marina: Hey.",
        "Shayne: I'm sorry I was MIA. I was at the gym working out with Remy when your mom called me. How's your granddad?",
        "Marina: He's fine. He's fine. You can see for yourself, you know. Thanks to your dad. How is he?",
        "Shayne: I don't know. I got a ten-second thing from my uncle. He said... he said... he said that there was some freak who went gunning for my dad, and now my dad's on the wrong side of some holding cell.",
        "Marina: Shayne, I am so sorry. I wish there was something I could do.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, there is something you could do. You could tell me how all this happened.",
        "Billy: Frank, what's the holdup here? I mean, Josh has given you a statement, he's given you fingerprints, DNA evidence. He's cooperated in every way. Now, what's the problem?",
        "Frank: Billy, I can't do anything until I've heard from the D.A..",
        "Billy: Well, he's not a flight risk. I can bring him back in the morning. Let's go out and talk to Ross and see what our options are.",
        "Josh: Now I really am afraid.",
        "Reva: Well, you know, Frank's going to have to let you out of here. Otherwise he's going to have to deal with Billy for the rest of the night.",
        "Josh: Whatever happens, you have to take care of yourself and take care of the kids.",
        "Reva: No. No, no, no, no, no. I'm going to be bringing you home. I know things have been tough for us for a few months now, but we are due for some good times. We are overdue. And I'm going to do whatever I have to to get you out of here.",
        "Danny: Okay, go say \u0091hi' to Mommy.",
        "Robbie: Mommy.",
        "Michelle: Hey. You woke him?",
        "Danny: I told him that Mommy had a bad dream.",
        "Robbie: Was it scary? Were there monsters?",
        "Michelle: Yes, it was very, very scary.",
        "Danny: What does Mommy do for you when you have a bad dream?",
        "Robbie: Kiss it away.",
        "Michelle: Yes, that's right. Would you that for Mommy? Would you kiss her bad dream away?",
        "Robbie: Butterfly kiss.",
        "Michelle: Really? Okay. Oh, thank you so much.",
        "Marina: Hey, look, all that you need to know is that your dad is safe, okay? You can leave the rest up to my dad, and he will make sure that he's treated fairly. You know, dating the Chief of Police's daughter does come in handy sometimes.",
        "Shayne: No, but it doesn't matter what your dad does. If this thing goes to court, then my dad might end up in jail for a long time.",
        "Marina: Hey, hey, you're getting way ahead of yourself.",
        "Shayne: No, I'm getting way behind. I didn't even... I've been so wrapped up in my own stuff, I... I didn't even know that my dad was in trouble.",
        "Marina: No. But your energy was exactly where it should have been, and I don't think your dad would have wanted you to change any of that.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, well, I'm back on my feet now, and I'm going to help my dad.",
        "Marina: How?",
        "Shayne: I'll think of something. What... what... what about this woman, Carrie Caruthers? What if I find out if she has any past history like this, like anything that could corroborate my dad's story, any criminal activity, like... maybe... maybe she has... maybe she has... I'll find out if she has friends or relatives in Springfield. Whatever it takes, I'll figure it out.",
        "Marina: Shayne, I understand your impulse here, but I really think just diving right headfirst into this thing, you're just going to end up getting hurt.",
        "Shayne: How am I going to get hurt?",
        "Marina: Well, you know, you're just going to get in the way of the investigation, and that is the last thing that your dad wants or that you want, you know. You've just... you've got to trust my dad on this one. He's going to make sure that everything is fair.",
        "Shayne: Okay, great. And then I'm just going to, what, sit around, do nothing?",
        "Marina: Well, no. I mean, you can step into your dad's shoes, you know? Help out your mom. Help out Marah. God, especially Marah. She really needs you right now.",
        "Ed: Come on. What do you say, sweetie? We're going to go to the hospital, and they're going to take a look at you just to make sure everything's okay.",
        "Marah: Then I can see my dad?",
        "Ed: Well, maybe tomorrow he can come and see you, all right?",
        "Jeffrey: I'll catch up with you, okay? I'll lock up.",
        "Ed: Okay.",
        "Jeffrey: (Sighs)",
        "Ross: Frank, I know it's late, but I'm still going to try and get a bail bondsman...",
        "(Phone rings)",
        "Frank: Excuse me. It's Jeffrey O'Neill. All right, O'Neill, what's the verdict? I've had Josh Lewis on ice for hours now.",
        "Jeffrey: Has he been processed?",
        "Frank: Yeah, he's been given the works. Listen, I also have Ross Marler here. Ross is representing him, and he's pushing for a speedy arraignment.",
        "Carrie: Has it ever occurred to you that perhaps my life might be the one that's in danger?",
        "_Jeffrey: Did someone threaten you? _",
        "Carrie: Well, let's just say that there are a lot of people in Springfield who would like for me to vanish without a trace.",
        "Frank: O'Neill!",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, Frank, you're going to have to hold Josh overnight. I don't care how you do it, but do it.",
        "Frank: You sure about that?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, we're going to question them all again.",
        "Frank: All of them?",
        "Jeffrey: That's right. Josh, your dad, and Big Brother Billy -- all of them.",
        "(Phone hangs up)",
        "Ross: Josh, I still want to get a bail bondsman, a judge, and get you out of here tonight.",
        "Billy: They've got no case. I mean, you've got witnesses. It was self-defense.",
        "Reva: Listen to these guys, Joshua. Frank, so can I go out and warm up the car so I can get this guy out of here?",
        "Frank: Not yet. I'm sorry, Josh, but the bond hearing's been postponed. I can't release you tonight.",
        "Tony: Next on Guiding Light...",
        "Eden: I have something to tell you about me and Tony.",
        "Bill: What about you and Tony?",
        "Marina: If you mess this up, you could be responsible for sending your dad to jail for life."
