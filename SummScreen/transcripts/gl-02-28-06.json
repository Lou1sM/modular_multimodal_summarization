        "Coop: Ava, did I screw something up here?",
        "Ava: What? Um... no. I don't know.",
        "Coop: Okay, that's a great answer. Would you turn around and look at me? I mean, what's going on? What's wrong?",
        "Ava: I've been thinking about the room and just living here.",
        "Coop: Right. Ava, I told you I wasn't going to let Lizzie force you out of here.",
        "Ava: And that was really great of you.",
        "Coop: But?",
        "Ava: But... I guess I could say I want to be noble and decent and I don't want to cause trouble with you two...",
        "Coop: Right, right, but the truth of the matter is?",
        "Ava: The truth of the matter is you love Lizzie and watching that really sucks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Hey.",
        "Beth: Oh.",
        "Lizzie: Watch it. Mom.",
        "Beth: Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Why are you dressed like that?",
        "Beth: Sweetie, uh...",
        "Lizzie: What's wrong? You look like you've just seen the dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Hey, you don't come back to me real soon, I'm going to come looking for you.",
        "Tammy: Start looking behind you. Hmmm, I guess you missed me.",
        "Jonathan: Where the hell were you?",
        "Tammy: Easy. What's going on?",
        "Jonathan: I'm cool. Are you okay? All right, then everything's cool.",
        "Tammy: So what are you so worried about? Jon?",
        "Jonathan: Nothing-- I just wanted you here with me.",
        "Tammy: Sandy came by today.",
        "Jonathan: Here? What did she say? Did he threaten you?",
        "Tammy: No, Jonathan. He threatened you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Cassie. Come on in?",
        "Cassie: I'm not here for a cup of tea, Sandy.",
        "Sandy: let me guess. You're here to tell me to stay away from Tammy.",
        "Cassie: You got that right. Back off, Sandy! Tammy has enough to deal with.",
        "Sandy: No kidding. But I'm not the one making her miserable. I'm not the one ruining her life and you know it. Now I made you an offer before, you refused it. And now I'm guessing you're finally figuring out that you're not going to get rid of Jonathan on your own. You need my help. That's okay; I've already started laying the ground work.",
        "Cassie: What ground work?",
        "Sandy: A way to get Jon out of Tammy's life permanently. Interested?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Josh. Josh? You all right? Oh, God. So, what happened?",
        "Josh: Nobody really knows. Reva's still unconscious. Billy was driving, but uh...",
        "Jeffrey: Billy was driving. You don't think that-- uh, have you called Cassie? I'm going to do that, okay? I'll do that for you. So, you just... don't worry about that, okay?",
        "Josh: It's time for you to wake up, Reva. You remember all of those talks we had before about destiny? About how there are some things that happen for a reason, that are meant to happen? Well, this is not one of those things, okay. Destiny has other plans for you. How many times have I been by your bedside in some hospital somewhere, or you've been by mine? We've been through pretty much everything in our life together, I think. But somehow we managed to survive every single time and this time, you're going to pull through this. So you might as well just get on with it. And open up those impossibly beautiful blue eyes of yours and talk to me. We can talk about anything you want. Tell me whatever's on your mind, okay. Just say something, please.",
        "Billy: Sounds like a pretty one-sided conversation over there.",
        "Josh: Hello, Billy.",
        "Billy: How is she?",
        "Josh: She's hanging in there.",
        "Billy: Damn.",
        "Josh: Let me tell you something, okay. You don't get to play the self-pity game with me this time. Reva is where she's at because of you. You did this to her, Billy.",
        "Billy: Josh...",
        "Josh: No. You were drinking before you got behind that wheel, right? Reva's in that bed because of you, and there's no way around that fact.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Go ahead.",
        "Sandy: Well, Johnnyboy's got some big bills to pay and I think he's long overdue.",
        "Cassie: And I'm guessing you feel you're due for some payback yourself?",
        "Sandy: You think so?",
        "Cassie: You know what I think, Sandy? I think you've got his all figured out. And if you can think of a way to get Jonathan out of Tammy's life for good...",
        "Sandy: I'd be doing you and her a big favor, right?",
        "Cassie: Not to mention yourself, right? All right, Sandy, if you do go after Jonathan, I do not want Tammy involved. If she gets caught in the middle, you're going to have to deal with me.",
        "Sandy: Okay, look. Tammy is...",
        "Cassie: No, no, no.",
        "Sandy: Jonathan's biggest weakness!",
        "Cassie: Tammy is out. She is out. You don't call her; you don't bait her. You don't even look at her, understand? ( Cell phone ringing )",
        "Sandy: I think you better answer that. That could be our... Tammy. ( Cell phone ringing )",
        "Cassie: Hello.",
        "Jeffrey: Hi.",
        "Cassie: Jeffrey, what is it?",
        "Jeffrey: Listen, your sister has been in a car accident. I'm at Cedars now.",
        "Cassie: Oh, my God, is Reva okay?",
        "Sandy: Reva?",
        "Jeffrey: It's too early to say. Josh is here, too. Cassie?",
        "Cassie: I'm on my way.",
        "Sandy: What's the matter with Reva?",
        "Cassie: Never mind.",
        "Sandy: Fine, I'm coming with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: That's how that little weasel works, he smiles and acts one way and then he comes from behind and just...",
        "Tammy: I guess you know Sandy better than I do in some ways.",
        "Jonathan: Unfortunately. He's pretty pathetic when he gets desperate, too. Spitting out those threats.",
        "Tammy: What kind of threats?",
        "Jonathan: Lame stuff. Nothing to worry about.",
        "Tammy: I'm afraid, Jonathan. I mean, Sandy's been doing really weird stuff. I mean, he had this tape of you threatening him that he played for me.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, have a little faith; I know how to handle Sandy.",
        "Tammy: The tape made you sound crazy. I mean, I took it from him, but he'll find something else to use against you. He will; I know it. ( Cell phone rings ) Hello. Hey, Jeffrey, are you okay? Oh, no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Have a good one.",
        "Ava: I'm doing it again. I'm making things weird.",
        "Coop: Ava, things are weird. The good thing is that they get better.",
        "Ava: It is totally my fault, though. I shouldn't have opened my mouth.",
        "Coop: Ava, look, if you hadn't opened your mouth, and told me how you feel, then I wouldn't have been able to tell you how I feel, you know.",
        "Ava: It's not like that would've made a difference. You're trying to get back together with Lizzie--",
        "Coop: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who said anything about me trying to get back--",
        "Ava: I mean, that you're open to that, that-- you know-- that is might be an option for you. Because if it is, that means you still have feelings for her. And I don't want to interrupt that ever. It's fine, it's cool; I'll find a new place.",
        "Coop: Right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Mom, I don't get it. Why do you look like you just got done planting a flag on the south pole?",
        "Beth: Ah, well, I went for a hike and you know, the snow is really deep up there.",
        "Lizzie: You went for a hike in the snow? Was the elliptical machine broken at the gym?",
        "Beth: Uh... ( coughs ) Uh, no, of course not. I just... I like going up there, you know, top of the world, looking down on the town.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I get it, I guess. Why haven't you returned my calls? I mean, you make this big speech about us being a team again and then you disappear. I mean, I thought we could do the country club for like a late tea or a lunch.",
        "Beth: Sweetie, I'm sorry, I didn't know that you had called me. I uh... lost my cell phone.",
        "Lizzie: Well, you should get a new one.",
        "Beth: You're right, I should. I should, but, um... you know, I've been so busy. Like a full schedule.",
        "Lizzie: Is this about granddad, Mom?",
        "Beth: What do you mean?",
        "Lizzie: You know, the keeping so busy that you don't have time to think about him being gone?",
        "Beth: ( Coughing ) Oh. ( Stammering ) Yeah, maybe-- maybe it has something to do about that. You know, I haven't been the same since your dad.",
        "Lizzie: I'm sorry I haven't been around more to help.",
        "Beth: You've come so far in the last year, haven't you?",
        "Lizzie: Poverty will do that. And love-- falling in love.",
        "Beth: Yeah. Love makes us do a lot of things, both good and bad. You know that when I froze your accounts and I canceled your credit cards, that was out of love. I was just afraid. There's so much history between the Spaulding and the Coopers, and you were getting involved with Coop and I was afraid that you were getting in over your head.",
        "Lizzie: I understand.",
        "Beth: But you proved me wrong. You showed me that.",
        "Lizzie: Me? How?",
        "Beth: By taking charge of your life because that's what you did. That's what I'm trying to do now. No more being the victim. I'm watching you handle what you had to handle, being so strong and sure and knowing what you wanted and going after it. Oh, sweetheart, you... you are the strongest, bravest person I have ever known and I forgot that for a while. Thank you. Thank you for reminding me.",
        "Lizzie: Do you want to go inside and talk a while, grab a table?",
        "Beth: I would love to, but um... I can't. I need to go home; I need to think.",
        "Lizzie: Think?",
        "Beth: Yeah. Um, about the future, what my next move is going to be. But let's do lunch soon, okay?",
        "Lizzie: I would like that.",
        "Beth: Good. And, honey, I promise what's coming, the future, it's going to be so bright for both of us. You'll see.",
        "Lizzie: I know it will be, Mom. Bye! Mom is right. Know what you want, grab it and take control. It's time to take control.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Salad, lots of feta cheese and a hamburger.",
        "Lizzie: Coop, hey.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, hey, how are you?",
        "Ava: It's okay. I've got the rest. It's fine.",
        "Coop: You sure?",
        "Ava: Yeah.",
        "Coop: Okay.",
        "Ava: Good.",
        "Coop: All right. Hey there.",
        "Lizzie: Hey. Is, um... everything okay?",
        "Coop: Yeah, yeah, everything's fine, you?",
        "Lizzie: Well, I bought an apartment.",
        "Coop: You what?",
        "Lizzie: All of my credit cards and my accounts have been turned back on. I'm rich again.",
        "Coop: So your mom finally caved. Well, congratulations. That's what you always wanted, right?",
        "Lizzie: Well, it's okay. Actually, I bought the apartment so that we could celebrate.",
        "Coop: You bought Quinn's penthouse?",
        "Lizzie: My penthouse. But... I have a full crew there cleaning it out; all the remnants of Quinn are gone.",
        "Coop: Good for you. That's good for you, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: So I was thinking maybe you might stop by. I mean, all that stuff's going to be gone-- no bad memories, nothing.",
        "Coop: Yeah. Um... Lizzie, look. It's easier to get rid of old things than it is to get rid of old memories.",
        "Lizzie: But it is a start, right?",
        "Coop: Yes. Yes, it is a start.",
        "Lizzie: Great.",

        "Brian: Ava. Nice name.",
        "Ava: Thanks.",
        "Brian: So do I just sit anywhere, or do you show me?",
        "Ava: Well, this place is casual, so... yeah, anywhere is fine.",

        "Josh: Is that supposed to be a joke? Look at her, Billy. Look at her. It's because of you and this frickin' bottle.",
        "Billy: You can't possibly hate me as much as I hate myself right now.",
        "Josh: Yeah, I wouldn't be too sure about that.",
        "Billy: Josh, I can beat this. I know I can beat this.",
        "Josh: Yeah, yeah, I know you can, Billy.",
        "Billy: I'm telling you, Josh, I can.",
        "Josh: Well why don't you try telling me something you haven't tried a million times before.",
        "Billy: This is a wake-up call.",
        "Josh: What about Reva? Does she get a wake-up call?",
        "Billy: Yeah, okay, Josh, I did have a drink. But, I... she wanted to get out of there and I wanted to leave Cross Creek, too. And I really didn't think that I... I just didn't--",
        "Josh: No, you didn't think, Billy, that's the whole point. You couldn't think for the same reason that you couldn't react when you needed to react the most.",
        "Billy: So where are the cops? When are they coming here?",
        "Josh: What, you mean to take you in?",
        "Billy: Yeah, something like that.",
        "Josh: They don't know.",
        "Billy: How can they not know?",
        "Josh: The EMT's brought you here. For some reason I can't really fathom, they didn't test your blood alcohol content.",
        "Billy: But you were there and you knew.",
        "Josh: Yes, I did. But I didn't say anything.",
        "Billy: Thank you.",
        "Josh: Don't thank me. I haven't said anything yet, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to.",

        "Jonathan: If I find out the guy who was driving that truck...",
        "Tammy: Easy. She will be okay. She has to be.",
        "Sandy: You bet Reva will be okay. She's tough.",
        "Jonathan: What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Sandy: I came with Cassie.",
        "Tammy: What?",
        "Sandy: We drove our own cars, but I was there with her when she got the call about Reva.",
        "Cassie: Oh, my God. Reva? How did this happen? Do we know who is responsible for this?",
        "Billy: Yeah. I'm responsible for this.",

        "Brian: Almost as good as McHale's Pub in Madison, only we used onion rings instead of grilled.",
        "Ava: Wait, Madison? You waited tables in Madison. I heard Madison is like a great party town.",
        "Brian: Working three jobs to pay tuition. I didn't get out that much.",
        "Ava: Yeah, well, welcome to my life.",
        "Brian: Oh, you still in school?",
        "Ava: Ah, you know, not at the moment. I'm just trying to pay off things, bills. How about you, you still waiting tables?",
        "Brian: No. No. If I'm on my feet, I want to be on top of a building or bossing a work crew around.",

        "Lizzie: I shouldn't be talking like this, I know. And we do have a lot of stuff to deal with, but I can't stop feeling what I feel and how much I love you and need you and want you. I've thinking about it all of the time, Coop. It's all I can think about.",

        "Josh: No, actually we're talking about you right now and you're drinking, Billy. I mean, is somebody going to have to die before you get your act together?",
        "Billy: Hey, I will get it together; I'll make it work. Nobody's going to have to die.",

        "Billy: When I can't even take care of myself? Don't worry, I'll figure it out. I'll do whatever it takes. I will do whatever it takes to take care of Reva and not the devil or God or the great Josh Lewis is going to do anything to stop me.",

        "Josh: Of course I want to take care of Reva. She's still my wife. What are you talking about?",

        "Billy: Come on, Josh! She cares about you; don't you know that's just like wrapping her around your little finger.",
        "Josh: That's not what I'm doing.",
        "Billy: Bull. The last thing she needs right now is somebody that she cares about treating her badly.",
        "Josh: Oh, my God. This is not about your guilt, is it, or this accident? You want to be with Reva. You want to be with her, don't you?",
        "Jonathan: Hey, Billy.",
        "Tammy: Are we interrupting?",

        "Jonathan: No, no. She knows I'm here.",
        "Tammy: Talk to her. If anyone can wake her up, you can.",
        "Billy: I want to go out and get some air, too.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, Mama bear. It's cub. You resting; you look good. It would be really cool if you woke up right now because there's some things going on I wouldn't mind, um... running by you. You're the only person that gets me, you know. Like, Tammy loves me, but you really get me.",
        "Cassie: Sorry, I just wanted to...",
        "Jonathan: No, that's fine. Just mom-sitting. She's all yours.",
        "Cassie: She loves you a lot, you know.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, well, she needs more than just me, so when she wakes up, why don't you start talking to her again?",
        "Cassie: I'll try.",
        "Jonathan: Just do it.",
        "Cassie: ( Clearing throat ) I really want to. Jonathan's not the only one who really needs you.",
        "Jonathan: All right, Sandy, I'd better get to you before you get to me.",

        "Coop: Ava, um... look, is everything okay at that table? Is he okay?",
        "Ava: Who, table four? Brian? Table four. He's fine. He asked me out, that's all. No big deal.",
        "Coop: Uh... oh, he asked her out, no big deal.",

        "Coop: You're welcome. You're welcome. And congratulations on the penthouse, the apartment.",
        "Lizzie: Coming by is probably kind of a little bit too much to ask?",
        "Coop: Um, yeah, yeah, it kind of is.",
        "Lizzie: I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking, but maybe we could do something else. Maybe a movie.",
        "Coop: Sure. Yeah, sure. Something else sometime would be great. A movie sounds fine. I'll be glad to do that.",

        "Brian: As advertised.",
        "Lizzie: You are worth every penny, and um, here's a little extra for your trouble.",
        "Brian: It's no trouble. To tell you the truth, taking cash from a client as hot as Ava is...",
        "Lizzie: Please, first impressions. You're going to earn every dime of this trying to stay awake on the second date.",
        "Brian: Second? It seems you may need my services long-term.",
        "Lizzie: As long as it takes to get little miss waitress's mind off my boyfriend.",
        "Brian: How far exactly do you want my services to extend?",
        "Lizzie: Do whatever you have to do. Just don't do it here again, okay? Take her somewhere else.",
        "Brian: You're paying.",
        "Lizzie: Gladly. As long as she...",
        "Coop: Ava, I'll be right back inside. Hold on. Ah, hey. So... everything okay here?",

        "Tammy: Are you okay?",
        "Jonathan: I am now. I just wanted to get it out of my system. You know how it is. When it's time, you've just got to take care of business.",

        "Josh: This is crazy.",
        "Billy: Why is this crazy, because it's not \"Josh and Reva, always\"? Look, what was the \"always\" when you were out with Olivia on Valentine's Day? Or when she needs help with her son and you side with Cassie?",
