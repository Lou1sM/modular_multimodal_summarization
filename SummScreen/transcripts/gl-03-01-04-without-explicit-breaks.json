        "Billy, Buzz and Ed prepare to be called into the police station for questioning about Carrie's death. They agree to tell the police that Josh shot Carrie in self-defense. But when Frank and Jeffrey question them they use the same phrases, their story is too pat. Alan counters Gus's questions about his car being seen the night of the shooting by saying he was scouting the land for possible purchase. Gus finds it an odd explanation and decides to look into it. Alan is brought in for questioning but comes with his attorney and refuses to answer any questions. However, Gus later confronts Alan saying that it is curious Alan was looking to buy that land, considering he already owns it. Bill is dealing with the after-effects of Josh being taken into custody. He rants to Eden about the damage that keeping secrets can cause. This display of emotion causes her to admit the investigation she and Tony did to find out if the mob had infiltrated Lewis Construction or Danny's campaign. Billy comes to see Bill to say that he's going to suggest that Josh step aside for the time being if Bill feels up to the challenge of managing Lewis Construction. Marina and Michelle tend to Marah who is still suffering the after-effects of the drugged ring. Marah is troubled that her own recollections of the shooting do not match the story given to the police. But the girls remind her that they must stick to the story that they were not at the fairgrounds that night. Michelle realizes that the rings Carrie gave the girls to wear the night of the shooting might be important and decides to hang on to them. Marah promises to stay at home and sleep off the effects of the drug but, when they leave her, she sneaks out to the police station in search of her father. Upon arrival, she is surprised to see that her father is the only one who has not been released and heartbroken to find out that Jeffrey made the call to keep Josh in jail."

        "Buzz: So how are you guys holding up?",
        "Billy: Isn't it just like Josh? I mean, deep down inside him, I've always known that he has wanted to be punished for what happened, and now you throw Marah into the mix, and the man's feeling downright guilty.",
        "Ed: I think we all do.",
        "Billy: Frank say anything to you?",
        "Buzz: No. Figure he's holding Josh overnight because Josh didn't give him a reason not to.",
        "Ed: It's hard to fight charges you've already admitted to.",
        "Billy: Well, he's also taking attention away from Marah.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, and us.",
        "Billy: Yeah. I don't see why Frank can't let him go out on his own. To keep him in there, it makes him seem like he's guilty.",
        "Ed: Billy, he... he's supposed to seem like he's guilty.",
        "Billy: Yeah, of self-defense. Now you're making him seem like he's Jack the Ripper. Did you see this paper? Look at this. Look, look.",
        "Buzz: Josh knew what to expect from the press, and Frank's just doing his job. I mean, he's going by the book. He has to. If he cuts some slack for Josh, the DA's going to be all over him.",
        "Ed: I think he already is.",
        "Buzz: Well, that's the point: He's doing what he's got to do. That's whey he's dragging us in for questioning.",
        "Ed: Yeah, we've got to talk about that.",
        "Billy: Look, we tell the story, we tell it like we practiced. Frank's going to believe you. We just tell that story. We stick to it.",
        "Buzz: It's got to be airtight, you know? One slip and it's over.",
        "Billy: It can't happen now. We're talking about my little brother, here.",
        "Ed: As usual, Alan gets out of it.",
        "Buzz: The Luck of the Spauldings.",
        "Jeffrey: This is everything? You're sure?",
        "Gus: What's up, O'Neill? What's the word?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, there isn't one. Someone died last night.",
        "Gus: Yeah, I heard. So?",
        "Jeffrey: Read about it in the paper. I've got to get going.",
        "Gus: Alan's car was seen driving away from the crime.",
        "Jeffrey: And how did you find that out?",
        "Gus: He admitted it. So what? Now you're interested?",
        "Jeffrey: What else did he tell you?",
        "Gus: He told me he was out there surveying the fairgrounds; he was thinking about buying it.",
        "Jeffrey: But you think...",
        "Gus: I think he's a liar.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, I'll keep you informed. All right. Oh, it's a nightmare. This phone has been ringing all morning.",
        "Eden: Lewis' clients getting nervous?",
        "Bill: Eden, they're beyond nervous, okay? We're talking about people we've been working with for years, and they're ready to jump ship.",
        "Eden: That is ridiculous. They just brought him in for questioning.",
        "Bill: Did you see this newspaper? Did you see it? Do you see this? It says they just want to ask him a couple of questions? It says \"Josh Lewis\" and \"murder\" in the same sentence. We're talking about a guy who wouldn't hurt a soul, let alone shoot someone.",
        "Eden: Do you want me to call Nicky?",
        "Bill: He's at Spaulding, isn't he?",
        "Eden: He's still a cop. Maybe he can tell me something.",
        "Bill: I don't know. Give it a shot; what the hell?",
        "Eden: Honey, you are right about Josh. He is a good man from a good family, and, I don't know, maybe they're just...",
        "Bill: What? They want stock tips? Eden, the press is not going to use a word like \"murder\" if they don't have something.",
        "Eden: What could they have?",
        "Bill: I don't want to go there.",
        "(Phone ringing)",
        "Bill: Let's see who this is.",
        "Eden: Hey, you have to go wherever this is taking you.",
        "(Phone ringing)",
        "Eden: And wherever this is going, you are going to deal with it. And if Josh is in trouble, you are going to deal with it, because that is what family does.",
        "(Phone ringing)",
        "Eden: And if the company is in crisis, you're going to do this for your father and your uncle, and you are going to play with the big boys. You got it?",
        "(Phone ringing)",
        "Bill: (Sighs) Yeah, Bill Lewis.",
        "Michelle: Hey, you okay?",
        "Marah: Michelle...",
        "Michelle: Don't get up. Don't get up. Has she been like this all morning?",
        "Marah: I've just been having a little bit of trouble focusing.",
        "Marina: Yeah, and getting up off the couch without feeling seasick.",
        "Michelle: Marah, you should have stayed at Cedars all night.",
        "Marah: No, I'm fine. I'm fine. I just... Have you heard anything from my father?",
        "Michelle: Nothing so far.",
        "Marah: I have to go see him.",
        "Michelle: No, no! You just got up too quickly. Look, your dad is probably still at the police station, and they're not going to let anyone see him until they're finished questioning him.",
        "Marina: Yeah, and Ed said that we're supposed to stay away from the police station.",
        "Marah: Why?",
        "Michelle: Because there's nothing you can do to help him anyway, and we've got to stick to our story. We've got to stay here, because, remember, we were here all night long watching a movie; we never went to the fairgrounds.",
        "Marah: I'm sorry, you guys. I know I'm having a little bit of confusion right now, but we all know that we were there.",
        "Bill: Look, all I'm saying is just wait and see, okay? Hey, how long have you been working with us? How long have you known Josh? Then you know just as well as I do that he is innocent. Yeah, yeah, it's some nut. That's... Look, I'm going to... I'll keep you informed. All right, thanks. (Sighs) I don't know if I can do this.",
        "Eden: You can do this, and you are doing fine.",
        "Bill: Eden, everyone wants details. I don't even know what's going on. I mean, if this Caruthers woman wanted a job with us, how come I've never heard about her?",
        "Eden: I don't know, maybe your uncle didn't want to worry about you. Maybe he thought it would just go away.",
        "Bill: No, stuff like this usually doesn't go away, Eden, okay? It escalates. Look, if this got to a point where Josh felt he needed to take action, then... You don't keep things like this quiet.",
        "Eden: I understand keeping things quiet. I used to do that. You know, you... you think telling is going to make it worse.",
        "Bill: What are you talking about? It's the not telling, Eden, that makes things worse. You keep stuff like this inside you, then no matter what you say, no matter what you do, you're not being honest. It's just not real.",
        "Eden: I did that for so long, Bill.",
        "Bill: Well, look, then you met me, and I made an honest girl out of you, right?",
        "Eden: You did.",
        "Bill: (Sighs)",
        "Eden: There's something I've been holding back, something that's been eating me. Um... I have something to tell you about me and Tony.",
        "Bill: (Laughs) Eden, what about you and Tony?",
        "Cassie: Hey. Morning, sunshine.",
        "Harley: Don't start with me.",
        "Cassie: Well, what do you want to do? Do you want to grab our coffee and rolls and go for a long walk? I've got to tell you, a walk would clear my head right now.",
        "Harley: No. I... I can't go for a walk. I'm not even awake yet, Cassie. I haven't even had my coffee yet.",
        "Cassie: Okay. So no walk. What's going on with you? You're supposed to make me feel better.",
        "Harley: There's nothing going on with me. I'm just not the morning person that you are. It was actually my morning to sleep in late until you called.",
        "Cassie: Oh, I'm sorry; I am. I'm just trying to keep my mind occupied. You know, I'm so worried about Josh.",
        "Harley: No, I know. I understand. I'm worried, too. There's a lot of strange stuff going on lately everywhere. Notice my father and Marina MIA again? I've got to talk to Frank.",
        "Cassie: Frank later; me now, okay? And Buzz is fine, right? I mean, I see him every day. He seems fine.",
        "Harley: You see him every day? Oh, so the truth comes out. The owner of The Beacon prefers the coffee at Company.",
        "Cassie: (Laughs) Oh, yes, I do. I mean, I know I run this big, fancy hotel, but you know me; I'm a diner kind of girl. I come here at least twice a day for my caffeine fix.",
        "Harley: Twice a day? You're such a freak.",
        "Cassie: (Laughs)",
        "Harley: Speaking of freaks, there's actually someone who shares your preference in coffee.",
        "Cassie: Well, whom do I share so much in common with?",
        "Harley: Jeffrey O'Neill.",
        "Jeffrey: So what do you think he's lying about?",
        "Gus: He's lying about the whole thing with the land. Purchasing the fairgrounds? No, I've been with him for months. I know his meetings, I know about his appointments, and this is the first time I'm hearing anything about a purchase of land, especially the fairgrounds. It's a huge piece of property. It would cost a fortune, not to mention they'd have to develop it, not to mention that the board would have to get involved. No. Look, I want to be wrong about this, but the cop in me is not taking his story at face value. What, there's a murder on the piece of property he's thinking about buying? He just happens to be... well, his car, anyway, seen driving away from the scene of the crime? It's just too many coincidences.",
        "Jeffrey: Coincidences only happen in novels, not in real life.",
        "Gus: It's... it's killing me.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, I'll tell you what. I'll give it to Frank, we'll let him shake it out.",
        "Gus: No, I can't do that.",
        "Jeffrey: I was hoping you'd say that.",
        "Marah: You guys, why are you looking at me like that? We all know that we were at the fairgrounds last night.",
        "Michelle: Right. And what do you remember?",
        "Marah: Not much. It's... it's not clear.",
        "Marina: You guys, I'm sorry, but what about what we agreed to say, you know? I think, for everyone's sake, we ought to just stick to that.",
        "Marah: It doesn't feel right. If I could just remember more...",
        "Marina: But you don't, you don't. And if you don't remember it, let's just say what we said we were going to say.",
        "Marah: It's just hazy. If I could just...",
        "Michelle: Look, we all felt weird last night. We talked about it, remember? My dad asked if we ate or drank anything?",
        "Marina: Right, which we didn't.",
        "Michelle: And now that I'm saying it, we all felt weird at exactly the same time.",
        "Marina: Something's not right.",
        "Michelle: But we did have one thing in common.",
        "Marina: Oh, come on, the rings? What, you think they're cursed or something?",
        "Michelle: I don't know, but we all felt the same way last night: Disoriented, confused, and Carrie insisted that we wear them to the fairgrounds.",
        "Marah: Carrie. I have to go see my father.",
        "Michelle: No, no, Marah, no, no. You can't.",
        "Marah: Why not?",
        "Michelle: Because, Marah, until your head is clear and until we know you're going to stick with the story...",
        "Marah: The story is the only thing that I can remember anyway.",
        "Marina: It's just that if we say that we went to the fairgrounds, especially if we say that we went there to see Carrie, things are going to get a lot worse for everyone involved, especially your father.",
        "Bill: You and Tony? What?",
        "Eden: First of all, there is no me and Tony.",
        "Bill: Eden, please, just tell me what is going on.",
        "Eden: Tony and I were contacted by someone, this guy... I don't know who.",
        "Bill: What do you mean, you \"don't know who?\"",
        "Eden: He disguised his voice. I never saw his face. Tony and I, we were contacted separately, and he arranged a meeting.",
        "Bill: What are you talking about? Are you telling me you both went and met with some guy?",
        "Eden: I didn't know he was going to be there. And then this guy, he drops this bombshell that the mob is connected to Fifth Street.",
        "Bill: What? They used to be, yeah, sure.",
        "Eden: No, now. In Lewis Construction.",
        "Bill: Wait. What?",
        "Eden: And this guy, he says that you and Danny are going to get burned.",
        "Bill: All right, wait, wait. Why would he... why would he call you?",
        "Eden: Think about it, Bill. Reformed madam, reformed thug. Who would you tell if you had some dirty work to do? So he told us where to dig, so we did.",
        "Bill: Where?",
        "Eden: You're not going to like this.",
        "Bill: Eden, just tell me where.",
        "Eden: Lewis Construction payroll.",
        "Bill: Are you...",
        "Eden: Bruzi's guys were working for you.",
        "Bill: What are you talking... No, I would have known.",
        "Eden: How would you have known? Do you know every single detail about every single guy that's working for you? And when these guys want to get in somewhere, they get in. And I know.",
        "Bill: Oh, jeez.",
        "Eden: We took care of it. Actually, Tony took care of it, the way that Tony takes care of things. He figured the only way to keep you and Danny clean was by dealing with Bruzi himself.",
        "Bill: And he got stabbed.",
        "Eden: Yeah. But Bruzi got the message, and Lewis... The crews are clean, okay?",
        "Bill: Eden, I... I don't know what to say.",
        "Eden: Well, how about \"you're welcome?\"",
        "Bill: Sorry. Thank you. Thank you. I... It's... I just don't... But listen to me, okay? Don't you ever do anything like that again. I'm serious, Eden. Look, you could have got stabbed instead of Tony.",
        "Eden: Bill...",
        "Bill: Listen to me. I'm serious.",
        "Eden: But I didn't and I'm okay and I'm here. Everything's going to be okay.",
        "Buzz: Whoa, the infamous Box? Where you break people down, you wring confessions out of them? Where's the rack? Where are the little wires?",
        "Frank: Hey, Dad, would you knock it off? It's not going to be like that. Just have a seat.",
        "Jeffrey: Buzz?",
        "Buzz: Hmm?",
        "Jeffrey: Could you sit in the other seat, please?",
        "Buzz: Sorry. Are you going to sit?",
        "Frank: I'm going to be asking the questions. Thanks for coming in, Dad.",
        "Buzz: Anything I can do to help.",
        "Frank: Did you know the deceased, Caroline Caruthers?",
        "Buzz: No.",
        "Frank: Did you know that she was making threats directed at Josh Lewis?",
        "Buzz: No.",
        "Jeffrey: Then why did you go to the funhouse with Josh?",
        "Buzz: Oh, let me back up. I knew that she was causing trouble after Josh told me. I mean, before then, no, not up until that night, no.",
        "Frank: Obviously you took her threats seriously enough to bring a loaded gun.",
        "Buzz: Well, you know, the fairgrounds, late at night, stranger; I just had a gut feeling that something might get nasty, and it did. She shot me.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, she shot you. Why'd she shoot you when she was after Josh?",
        "Buzz: Unlucky me. Wrong time, wrong place. Oh, you know, all right, I took aim at her to stop her from shooting Josh, you know? A friend was in trouble and I wanted to help. And she shot me. I mean, the woman was nuts. She was just... she was raving.",
        "Jeffrey: So that's how you would describe her behavior then?",
        "Buzz: She was not in her right mind. She was ranting. Her behavior was erratic, completely erratic.",
        "Jeffrey: \"Erratic.\" But you said you didn't know that she was unbalanced before you went to the funhouse.",
        "Buzz: And yet I brought the gun, yes. I figured, better safe than dead. And because I played it safe, nobody ended up... Well, Josh didn't end up dead. You know, not to be callous here, but I was the one that was shot by a nutcase. Why are you grilling me?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, we couldn't question the dead woman.",
        "Buzz: I'm sorry about that. I'm sorry she died. I did what I had to do to save my friend. The way I see it: No crime committed.",
        "Marah: We were there. We went to the fairgrounds to say good-bye to Maryanne.",
        "Michelle: Yes, we did.",
        "Marina: Yes, but we're not saying that we were there.",
        "Michelle: Right, because my dad thought...",
        "Marah: Why does Ed want us to lie?",
        "Michelle: Because, Marah, if anyone knew we were there or even knew that we knew Carrie at all...",
        "Marina: Or worse yet, that we were there to see her...",
        "Michelle: Right, then the police would have a lot of questions for us.",
        "Marah: But we didn't even do anything wrong.",
        "Marina: Look, it's for our own protection, Marah.",
        "Marah: Meanwhile, my dad is stuck in jail? We could be helping him.",
        "Michelle: You don't even remember what happened, and Marina and I were outside, so we didn't see anything.",
        "Marah: Yeah, but I was there.",
        "Marina: Okay, but what if they don't believe you? Or what if my dad thinks that you're just trying to cover for your dad?",
        "Marah: Maybe if I remembered something it would help my dad. We could... we could make it fit. We could make the story fit. We're already saying that Carrie was stalking my dad, right? So they know that she's dangerous. So if we said that we knew her...",
        "Marina: No!",
        "Marah: Yes! If we said that we knew that she was dangerous, that would help my dad!",
        "Marina: Then we're going to have seven different people telling different versions of the same story. My dad is going to see straight through that. He's going to shoot holes through our stories.",
        "Michelle: Marah, Marah, look, I know that you want to help your dad, but what if it backfires?",
        "Marah: I was standing. I was beside her or in back.",
        "Michelle: Marah...",
        "Marah: Just please let me think. I was there, and I saw something. I saw something and then... then...",
        "Michelle: Marah, don't, don't.",
        "Marah: Why? Why?",
        "Michelle: Your dad shot Carrie because we were in danger, and that's all you need to remember.",
        "Billy: Frank, you're making me nervous.",
        "Jeffrey: We want you to be comfortable, Billy. Do you want some coffee or a soda or something?",
        "Billy: Oh, I'd like to get this over with.",
        "Frank: Your brother says that this Caruthers woman was pressuring him.",
        "Billy: Yes, yeah. She wanted to work for us. He said no, and she went ballistic.",
        "Jeffrey: That was the first time you had encountered Caroline Caruthers?",
        "Billy: Yes, aside from seeing her at the Country Club the other night at the dance, that was the first time.",
        "Frank: So exactly how would you describe her behavior at the fairgrounds?",
        "Billy: Definitely not normal. I would say she was erratic. She was raving about having been mistreated, and she was waving a... She pulled out a gun. Buzz pulled out his gun. She winged Buzz, he dropped his gun, and my brother picked it up and he shot her before she could shoot him.",
        "Jeffrey: That's some pretty Wild West stuff.",
        "Billy: My brother had no choice. It was him or her, and she lost.",
        "Marah: My hands, what...",
        "Michelle: Marah, you've got to stop, okay? It's trauma, all right? Our bodies play out all kinds of things that we don't understand.",
        "Marah: Like pretending that I'm shooting a gun?",
        "Michelle: You're identifying with your father. You're just trying to understand.",
        "Marah: I'm sorry, all right? Don't worry. I'm going to stick to the story, but I have to see my dad.",
        "Marina: Marah, what don't you get about this? You can't go.",
        "Michelle: You're going to see Jeffrey O'Neill there.",
        "Marah: So what?",
        "Michelle: So what? Okay, I don't know what kind of relationship you have with him, but I guarantee it will take a backseat to him doing his job.",
        "Marina: And what are you going to even say? I mean, you can barely even stand or think straight, you know, and if you mess this up, you could be responsible for sending your dad to jail for life.",
        "Marah: My dad is not going to spend the rest of his life in prison.",
        "Marina: Marah, if you go to the police station... Okay, look. No one even knows that we were there that night. Don't you get that? And we were responsible for what happened. Your fathers and my grandfather kept trying to push us away every step of the way, and we just kept pushing and pushing and pushing until we made a mess of everything.",
        "Marah: What, are you saying that somebody had to die?",
        "Michelle: Well, I think that's what Carrie wanted all along; she just didn't think it would be her.",
        "Jeffrey: Dr. Bauer, after Buzz was shot, what did you do?",
        "Ed: I went to help him. Thanks.",
        "Frank: Well, did you try to help this woman after she was shot?",
        "Ed: I was busy with Buzz. The next thing I knew, there was a shot. I turned around, and Josh is standing there with Buzz's gun, and Ms. Caruthers fell through the trap door into...",
        "Jeffrey: You know what? We're going to come back to that. Dr. Bauer, you left the crime scene.",
        "Ed: Well, Josh wanted me to get a hold of Marah and Shayne and Reva and let them know what happened.",
        "Frank: Ed, you were fleeing the scene of a crime.",
        "Ed: Frank, I did what I thought was best under the circumstances.",
        "Jeffrey: Wait a minute, Josh wanted you to contact his family? Why didn't you just call? Why didn't you just call Reva and let her handle her own family?",
        "Ed: I... You have to understand that Josh was... I mean, he was kind of in shock, too. I mean, he knew that he had to call Frank, right? And he did. And his first priority was for his children. Billy probably, maybe should have gone, but, you know, he wanted to stay with Josh. I mean, in hindsight it seems kind of illogical, but it made sense at the time.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Back to Caruthers: You characterized her as crazy.",
        "Ed: Did I use that word? It's not really a medical diagnosis. No, I'd say she was erratic.",
        "Jeffrey: \"Erratic?\"",
        "Ed: That's what I'd call it.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. That's what a lot of people would call it.",
        "Michelle: You know, we've been after our fathers for months, begging them to admit to a secret that they've been keeping for years.",
        "Marah: Now we're about to do the same thing.",
        "Marina: We can't change what happened to Carrie.",
        "Marah: That's what they said to us, remember? And we didn't buy it.",
        "Marina: Well, she was the one who came there ready to shoot someone.",
        "Marah: One of us.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, or one of them.",
        "Marina: I don't even see why it matters. I mean, God, I wish I'd never laid eyes on that...",
        "Michelle: Well, you know what? We did. We did, and look where it landed us.",
        "Marina: What are you doing?",
        "Michelle: The rings.",
        "Marina: I don't ever want to see those things again.",
        "Michelle: Well, I think we should keep them.",
        "Marah: Why? Because they hold such great memories?",
        "Michelle: Because we may need them.",
        "Jeffrey: You first.",
        "Frank: My father's in on a murder rap. What do you want from me?",
        "Jeffrey: \"A murder rap?\" Well, that's an interesting choice of words there, Frank. You could have said that he was in on witnessing an act of self- defense, but you didn't say that, did you?",
        "Frank: No, I didn't.",
        "Jeffrey: You know, I can handle the rest of this.",
        "Frank: Look, Jeffrey, the job's a job.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, if you're sure. What's your take?",
        "Frank: Well, what? I mean, you were... you were here. All these interviews sound very similar.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. You know, I find cases like this fascinating. Your dad's involvement notwithstanding. Sorry. It's classic Chaos Theory, Frank. You know, you study the seeming randomness of events for long enough, certain patterns start to emerge. What do we see?",
        "Frank: Well, we see that my father says that Caruthers' behavior was erratic. We got Billy saying that her behavior was erratic, and we got Dr. Ed saying her behavior was erratic.",
        "Jeffrey: \"Erratic.\" Now, given the chaos involved, what are the odds that every individual there that witnessed this event used the exact same word to describe it?",
        "Frank: It's hardly random.",
        "Jeffrey: I think our boys got their stories straight.",
        "Frank: The same story.",
        "Buzz: You holding up?",
        "Ed: Well, I wouldn't go that far, but I said what we planned to say.",
        "Buzz: We should be okay, you know. Everyone's clear about the story.",
        "Ed: Yeah, we're so good at this.",
        "Buzz: Oh, no.",
        "Alan: Well, gentlemen.",
        "Buzz: You're here.",
        "Alan: Yes.",
        "Buzz: Why?",
        "Alan: Well, apparently your son needs to speak with me about some business that happened out at the old fairgrounds the other day, and the only thing I know about it is what I read in the paper. Now, are you gentlemen involved somewhere in it? Could you give me a minute alone with these men?",
        "Lawyer: Of course.",
        "Alan: It seems my car was spotted leaving the fairgrounds the other night. Now, I made up the story that I was out there looking because I was interested in buying some property and the owner didn't show up, so I left.",
        "Ed: Who's going to buy that?",
        "Alan: Ed, it's a simple story. What's the problem?",
        "Buzz: What's the problem? What's the problem?",
        "Alan: Gentlemen, why are you getting so paranoid?",
        "Ed: The problem is you wouldn't be here if there weren't a problem.",
        "Buzz: Control your ego and do not... do not underestimate my son.",
        "Alan: My lawyer has advised me to say nothing.",
        "Ed: Well, do us a favor and don't.",
        "Alan: That is my intention.",
        "Buzz: Alan, Alan...",
        "Alan: Please, please, please. I can take care of this.",
        "Buzz: Talk to me when you're done.",
        "Ed: This just gets better and better.",
        "Buzz: He's always the smartest person in the room, you know? Until it's too late. I... I'm going to go to the restaurant.",
        "Ed: I have to fill out papers. We'll see you.",
        "Bill: Well, it's about time. Dad, the phone's been ringing all morning. Do you know the kind of damage control I've been doing?",
        "Billy: You've handled it, haven't you?",
        "Bill: Well, I guess so. What is going on? I mean, did Josh really shoot someone?",
        "Billy: Yeah, self-defense. What you read in the papers is pretty much what happened.",
        "Bill: Dad, our clients read the paper. Do you have any details that you can give me? I mean, something to give our clients that can get them off our back, keep them on the books for a while?",
        "Billy: Look, Josh had to shoot her. It was self-defense. The woman was deranged.",
        "Bill: What are you talking about? Who was this woman? What did Josh ever do to her?",
        "Billy: Just hold on a second. I need you to keep your eye on the shop right now. Josh and I are going to be busy wrangling this case and we're not going to be in for a couple weeks.",
        "Bill: All right. I mean, I got the ball. Payroll, workflow.",
        "Billy: No, I want you to handle everything.",
        "Bill: All of it?",
        "Billy: Yeah. Time to show your old man what you can do.",
        "Harley: Why are you so reluctant to talk about Jeffrey O'Neill?",
        "Cassie: I'm not reluctant to talk about him. Oh, don't do that. Don't look at me with that detective face.",
        "Harley: Cassie, I know you, and I know there's something you haven't told me.",
        "Cassie: He bugs me, you know?",
        "Harley: Still?",
        "Cassie: Yes, still. I thought that, you know, after a while I could get past him, but I can't. I mean, seeing Richard's face... It just hasn't gotten any easier. It hasn't. Most of the time I hate him, which is great, because then I can keep him at a distance. But there are times when he is nice, and that just makes it hard, you know? Like at the Valentine's...",
        "Harley: Valentine's Day Dance.",
        "Cassie: Well, there you go.",
        "Harley: I mean, that's the thing that you didn't tell me. Blake had to be the one to tell me that you guys were dancing at the Valentine's Day Dance.",
        "Cassie: Oh, my God! Are you kidding? That's why you're giving me the third degree?",
        "Harley: Yes.",
        "Cassie: Look, I wanted to talk to him about something serious, and he wouldn't talk to me unless I danced with him. It's that simple. It is. It... I don't know. Harley, it's just... I can't take him when he's nice, sometimes. It's just very difficult, and maybe I'm over-thinking this, I guess.",
        "Harley: All right. Let me... let's back up for a second. Isn't that a little tough for Edmund?",
        "Cassie: No. Okay, maybe. Maybe a little. This is really not making me feel better.",
        "Harley: Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I brought it up. I want you to be able to tell me when you're ready. You can talk to me about anything; you know that. And truth be told, there are times when I like Jeffrey O'Neill, too. Because, yes, he can be very human.",
        "Cassie: Let's just hope for Josh's sake that that's the case, because that's what's important right now.",
        "Jeffrey: Get any sleep?",
        "Josh: No.",
        "Jeffrey: Just a few more questions, Josh.",
        "Josh: I'm afraid I'm out of answers.",
        "Jeffrey: I know you feel that way, but I'm afraid I've got to ask the questions. Go ahead, have a seat.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Jeffrey: You say that Caruthers was stalking you.",
        "Josh: Yes.",
        "Jeffrey: Why?",
        "Josh: I already told you.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, I know. Tell me again.",
        "Josh: She came to me for a job and I said no.",
        "Jeffrey: And I'm sure you got some notes, right, or a job application, something like that?",
        "Josh: No. I threw it in the trash. Look, I... All I can tell you is the woman was stalking me. I've never had that kind of situation, really, before, you know, the disgruntled employee thing. I've always tried to be fair with people when it comes to business.",
        "Jeffrey: So you want to tell me what happened, huh? Where were you when you first thought someone was stalking you? Josh?",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Jeffrey: Tell me about the funhouse.",
        "Josh: I told you about the funhouse already. Why do... Okay. All right. How's this? I'll give you the short version: She was acting crazy, deranged. She shot Buzz, she hit him in the arm, and then she turned her back when Buzz fell, the gun had slid across the floor. I picked it up. I yelled to her to drop her gun, she wouldn't do it, I fired once, I hit the mirror, I fired a second time and I hit her.",
        "Jeffrey: Marah? Marah? What are you doing?",
        "Josh: Hey, hey, hello? You asked me to tell you what... Never mind, never mind. What I was saying was I fired at her, I hit her. She fell down through the trapdoor into the river below, and I guess, maybe, I should have tried to help her, to save her, but she was gone. She was washed away. You could hear the water rushing by.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. And no one could have saved you from that.",
        "Josh: What does that mean? I don't understand. What...",
        "Jeffrey: I don't know.",
        "Josh: Okay. I never would have... I never would have agreed to Buzz bringing his gun, but the fact is I'm standing here and I'm alive, and so I guess I'm glad he did.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. And that's all I'm saying: A bullet from that gun saved your life, Josh.",
        "Marah: You guys, if you can't find the video in Shayne's room, just try Remy's room because I think he might have borrowed it.",
        "Marina: Good idea. I'll be right back.",
        "Marah: Take your time.",
        "Bill: So you want me to run the company while this is going on?",
        "Billy: That's what you've been doing. Are you ready to do a little more?",
        "Bill: You bet I am. Look, are you sure you're okay with this?",
        "Billy: Absolutely. As a matter of fact, it's the one thing I feel okay about these days. I don't know what I'd do without you, Son.",
        "Buzz: How'd it go?",
        "Alan: Like clockwork. What about you?",
        "Buzz: I'm not used to matching wits with my son in an interrogation room.",
        "Alan: But it went smoothly, right?",
        "Buzz: As far as I can tell.",
        "Alan: Don't worry. We'll get off.",
        "Buzz: All except Josh.",
        "Alan: Well, look, we're doing what we can for the man.",
        "Gus: Hey, Big Al. I... There's one more thing.",
        "Alan: Gus, you're like a dog with a bone. You're never quite done, are you?",
        "Gus: I've got a restless mind.",
        "Alan: Well, I think it's a good strategy.",
        "Gus: Well, what do you mean, strategy?",
        "Alan: Catching a man off guard like this.",
        "Gus: That's not my intention at all.",
        "Alan: What, simple curiosity, is that it?",
        "Gus: Just tell me what you were doing scoping out the old fairgrounds, okay?",
        "Alan: Look, I've already told you. I was out there scouting out some property that I was interested in buying and turning a profit.",
        "Buzz: There's no harm in that.",
        "Gus: So it's for an investment?",
        "Alan: Yes, an investment.",
        "Gus: I see. Ordinarily, I'd say that's a good bet, you know? Waterfront property. \"Location, location, location.\"",
        "Alan: Well, I'm glad you approve.",
        "Gus: Except... except for one thing.",
        "Alan: What's that?",
        "Gus: Isn't it difficult to buy a piece of property that you already own?",
        "Marah: Where's my father?",
        "Ed: You're not supposed to be here. You're supposed to be at home.",
        "Marah: I don't care. Where is my father?",
        "Ed: I haven't seen him. They questioned us one at a time. Now listen to me...",
        "Marah: Let go, Ed.",
        "Ed: You are not going to do any good.",
        "Marah: Let go! Excuse me, I'm looking for my father, Josh Lewis. He was interrogated for a shooting. Is he here?",
        "Officer: I'm sorry, ma'am. I don't have the authority to give that information.",
        "Frank: Marah...",
        "Marah: Frank, why hasn't my dad been released?",
        "Frank: It's getting a little complicated.",
        "Marah: What do you mean? Jeffrey, I've been asking everybody about my father. Why hasn't he been released? What?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I'm sorry, Marah, but there's some unresolved issues. I'm keeping your father in custody.",
        "Edmund: Next on Guiding Light",
        "Marah: Why are you trying to twist my words around? You're trying to get a motive from me?",
        "Alan: If you think I am somehow connected to that woman's death, why don't you be man enough and come out and say it?",
        "Olivia: I just have one little thing that I have to do before I tell Phillip that Emma's alive.",
        "Cassie: No. Time's up."
