    "Recap": [
        "Through a series of flashbacks, Alan-Michael remembers how Alan never had time for him as a child and always planned on Phillip taking over. At the reading of Alan's will, Alex, Beth, and even the maid and butler get their shares of the Spaulding estate. When it comes to Alan-Michael's turn though, all he is left is a dime that is instructed to be given to him heads up. Alan-Michael remembers back to the night of the blackout when Alan called him and asked him to come back to Springfield to help and he flipped a dime to decide. Since it landed heads up, Alan-Michael decided to come home. Although Alan-Michael laughs it off during the will reading, later he opens up to Marina that Alan pushed him off from the grave. Marina gives him a toy car that she says reminds her of the night they met and lists off the things that she likes about him. Later Harley turns over sole control of the company to Dinah, telling Alan-Michael it is a present and now he can leave the company for good."

    "Transcript": [
        "Marina: You know, it is really too bad. I don't get very many days like this, completely jobless for the next 24 hours.",
        "Alan-Michael: I don't get many days like this, either.",
        "Marina: Like what?",
        "Alan-Michael: When I have to act like a responsible adult.",
        "Marina: Hmmm. You know what's weird, following the reading of a will for a culprit.",
        "Alan-Michael: For Spaulding's, any press is good press. Alan's dead, so people want to know what he left behind.",
        "Marina: I can tell you this much: A mess.",
        "Alan-Michael: A mess that could get bigger. The press heard that the company is going to name me the new CEO, so today I get thrown to the lions.",
        "Marina: I don't get you. The rest of your family is clawing for this and you act like it is a death sentence.",
        "Alan-Michael: I just need to get through the day. We'll do something tonight.",
        "Marina: Okay. Hey, you know, I'm really sorry about Alan. I mean I know a lot of people in this town kind of hated him, but a father is a father. Besides, you didn't turn out too bad, so he couldn't have been all that bad. (Creedence Clearwater Revival's \"Fortunate Son\" plays )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm going to enjoy this day.",
        "Evie: Hello, Alan-Michael. Welcome back, my goodness, you have been busy since the last time you came to visit.",
        "Young Alan-Michael: Do you like it?",
        "Evie: Of course. We love when you come to visit, especially your father.",
        "Young Alan-Michael: Can I see him now?",
        "Evie: Well, he is in a meeting, but I told him you're here, so who knows. Maybe some day, they'll be writing about you sitting in your father's big chair.",
        "Young Alan-Michael: My father's big chair.",
        "Alexandra: Well, aren't we all bright-eyed and bushy- tailed. It's a big day. Your portrait goes back on that wall of fame. Are you ready?",
        "Alan-Michael: I've been ready for this my whole life.",
        "Alan: What do you mean he's here. This is not a good time for Alan-Michael to visit. Hope, I did not agree to take Alan-Michael this week. No I did not. The point is, I'm a very busy man. Yes, sometimes too busy for my own son. ( Screaming )",
        "Alan: Alan-Michael, that vase you just broke is from the Ming Dynasty.",
        "Young Alan-Michael: I'm sorry, Dad.",
        "Alan: That's all right, I'll take it out of your salary when you start working for the company. Good to see you, son, I've been counting the moments until your arrival.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Hey, hey, the cover, you're never going to make it.",
        "Marina: What, what?",
        "Harley: It was subtle, but I could see it the moment I walked in, you're so happy. And is it possible it is Alan- Michael, and is it possible I think you guys are actually a good thing.",
        "Marina: It is possible. I don't know. He is sort of patched with my dad and with my mom, with you.",
        "Harley: So has it ever stopped anybody else in this town from hooking up?",
        "Marina: I don't know. I like him, Harley. And I don't care about his past. I mean I do, but I don't. I just like how he is with me now.",
        "Harley: That's all that matters. And I have to say I don't think I would have actually seen you and Alan-Michael together in the beginning, just like I would never have seen me and Gus together in the beginning.",
        "Marina: Do you think it was fate with you and Gus?",
        "Harley: You know, there is a funny little crook in the fate thing. When things are going really well, fate is the best thing. But when things are terrible, fate can be this \"no way out situation.\"",
        "Marina: I've been thinking about it a lot, the night of the blackout, and Michelle declared her love for Danny, and I walked into the middle of the street, and, bam, literally, and everything has changed.",
        "Harley: And another Cooper fell for another Spaulding. So, I don't know, maybe it is fate. I just -- I just hope that..",
        "Marina: That it works out better this time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Alan-Michael. Relax, darling. We wouldn't dare start reading the will without you. You're ready to win the daily double. The CEO of Spaulding, and that's more money than a small contract.",
        "Alan-Michael: We'll see.",
        "Alexandra: After this is all over, you and I are going to have a nice long talk about our positions in the family.",
        "Alan-Michael: Sounds like fun.",
        "Alexandra: Yeah. But keep your eye on what is important today, which is...",
        "Alan-Michael: What's that?",
        "Alexandra: Well, to appear, even if for a few moments, that you are grieving the loss. Darling, Alan did love you in his way.",
        "Alan-Michael: I love you. You okay? Beth?",
        "Beth: Alan-Michael. I always assumed that this would be over, and that he would come home. What?",
        "Alan-Michael: I always thought he was superhuman, too.",
        "Beth: I want you to know that whatever happens, you have my complete support. After all, you are the oldest surviving male Spaulding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: At first I wanted to go running and screaming in the other direction. I wanted nothing to do with him.",
        "Harley: But now?",
        "Marina: He was just not what I thought.",
        "Harley: All we have to do is convince your father.",
        "Marina: Hmmm, I can't. He is a Spaulding! Now he is going to be CEO, can't get more Spaulding than that.",
        "Harley: Alan-Michael is not what your father thinks he is. Not anymore. I don't even know if he ever was. He is not cut from the same cloth as Alan and Phillip. He doesn't have this maniacal desire to take over the world. But, hey, it is his family's company and it is his family's name. So...",
        "Marina: I don't know. Maybe it is the Bauer in him. He's just not like the rest of the Spaulding's. I just hope becoming CEO doesn't turn him into one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: You were always his favorite, Hilda.",
        "Hilda: Well, you know, he would say, without you, I'm nothing.",
        "Alan-Michael: He meant it.",
        "Hilda: He was a lovely man, a lion to be sure, but a lovely man.",
        "Alan-Michael: He was king of a pack of lions.",
        "Alexandra: More like a bunch of wolves, if you ask me, but what do I know. Beth, Lizzie, I'm so sorry for your loss.",
        "Beth: Alex, how you holding up?",
        "Alexandra: Well, fine. Thank you, thank you. Alan-Michael, it is good to finally meet you.",
        "Alexandra: Well, I hope Bauer raised him in New York mostly, so he was here on visits. I'm sure Alan looked forward to the visits. His family was everything. I remember how good he was with young Phillip.",
        "Alan-Michael: So do I.",
        "Young Alan-Michael: Hi, Phil, want to play.",
        "Phillip: You're smashing all of the cards into each other.",
        "Young Alan-Michael: So?",
        "Phillip: So, that is dumb.",
        "Young Alan-Michael: We'll take the red car, it is the nicest one.",
        "Phillip: That's okay, I don't really care.",
        "Alan: Well, boys, who wants to go watch their father at work.",
        "Young Alan-Michael: Can I go, please?",
        "Alan: What about you, Phillip.",
        "Phillip: No thanks.",
        "Alan: Aren't you a little old to be playing with cars.",
        "Phillip: No.",
        "Alan: Why don't you give the red car to your little brother, and you come with me. I'll show you how big boys play.",
        "Young Alan-Michael: Can I come, too?",
        "Alan: Next time, Alan-Michael.",
        "Alexandra: Your father will be missed...",
        "Alan-Michael: Yes.",
        "Alexandra: But his legacy moves on.",
        "Ian Tanner: Shall we take our seats for the reading of Alan Spaulding's will.",
        "Alan-Michael: I believe we're ready.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Hey, you know, I've got time to kill. You want to hit Main Street to wear something cute?",
        "Marina: You are so bad.",
        "Harley: Alan-Michael is going to be the man, and you're going to have to look good.",
        "Marina: Oh, stop. It is all so weird. I don't know, I mean the power and the money and... the money. I know he is not trying to act weird about it and all, but he is going to be going from wealthy to -- I don't know. And that changes a person. I know he likes the way his life is right now.",
        "Harley: Yes, he does. Especially now that you're in it. I won't let the company be a problem for you guys. I'll make sure the position is just temporary.",
        "Marina: Thank you. I know he won't let it be a problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Is it all right? You look like you're expecting something. As long as you show your appreciation when you get it.",
        "Ian Tanner: And to my beloved sister Alexandra, you were everything a sister should be: A protector, a companion, a teacher, a friend. To you I bequeath the Spaulding estates in Barbados, Switzerland, and I'd leave you the house, but it is to whoever controls Spaulding Enterprises. And to Beth, you were a wonderful partner, and I thank you for being my wife. A trust has been set up which will enable you to maintain your current standard of living.",
        "Beth: An allowance? What, is he going to leave me a paper route as well? I just trust that wherever Alan is, he is learning there are consequences for this decision.",
        "Alan-Michael: I always found father quite giving.",
        "Alan: Are you still here?",
        "Young Alan-Michael: I'm almost packed. I never did finish talking about you coming to my awards ceremony. I'm getting two --",
        "Alan: Something has come up, Alan-Michael, I have got to go to California.",
        "Young Alan-Michael: Well, is there anyway you could --",
        "Alan: It is not your run of the mill meeting I'm going to. It is a big opportunity for your brother, Phillip.",
        "Young Alan-Michael: Does Phillip even want to go to California?",
        "Alan: Of course he does.",
        "Young Alan-Michael: Philip could care less about the company. He tells you every chance he gets. I've been begging you to take me on a business trip, but you barely even see me.",
        "Alan: Your turn will come. In honor of your awards. There is a lot of money there, so spend it wisely. You see, I didn't forget.",
        "Ian Tanner: And to Phillip, a lifetime employment and a stipend, and the same to my butler, Jeremy.",
        "Beth: He is running out of things, and he hardly has mentioned anything to you.",
        "Alan-Michael: You're his wife. I would suspect he would be fair.",
        "Young Alan-Michael: Ready to rock and roll.",
        "Alan: Rock and roll?",
        "Young Alan-Michael: It is just an expression. I'm just saying I'm happy to be here -- I mean I'm eager to get started, show you what I can do. You get the memo, the one about reorganizing the marketing --",
        "Alan: Yes, and I'm waiting for Phillip, marketing is Phillip's specialty.",
        "Alan-Michael: Ready to rock. I'm sure I have a lot to learn. The company is in my blood. Point me in the right direction.",
        "Alan: If the company is in your blood, why can't you point yourself in the right direction, show a little input. I'm late for a meeting.",
        "Alan-Michael: Can I sit in?",
        "Alan: I hope it works out.",
        "Alan-Michael: You hope it works out. That's a ringing endorsement.",
        "Alan: I want to make one thing very clear to you: You will never fill Phillip's shoes, but I like your eagerness, and if you step the bar a little lower, you won't be disappointed. Oh, and, Alan-Michael, if you want to make a serious impression, choose a tie that says power, not one that looks like some prep-school nerd.",
        "Ian Tanner: We now come to the portion of the will concerning Alan Spaulding's last remaining son, Alan-Michael. There is a folder here addressed to you.",
        "Alan-Michael: Mr. Tanner, can you hold off one minute.",
        "Marina: Hi. I just couldn't stay away. I thought it would help if you had a hand to hold.",
        "Ian Tanner: To my son, Alan-Michael, I bequeath... this is... this is quite unusual.",
        "Alan-Michael: What's that?",
        "Ian Tanner: This is what your father wanted you to have.",
        "Alan: Alan-Michael, oh, son, it's so good to see you. It has been a long time.",
        "Alan-Michael: You think?",
        "Alan: Alan-Michael, I know that you and I have a lot to catch up on, we have a lot to work through. But I don't have much time. There is a blackout all through Springfield, and I have to get back to jail before they find out I'm missing.",
        "Alan-Michael: Really? You called me and begged me to come back to Springfield?",
        "Alan: Yes, because of the company. It's all slipping through my fingers.",
        "Alan-Michael: You need my help?",
        "Alan: Yes, I need your help.",
        "Alan-Michael: Because Phillip is gone, and Gus can't stand you. You have no one. So now it is my turn.",
        "Alan: It is your turn. You once told me that the company's blood runs through your veins.",
        "Alan-Michael: It still does, Dad.",
        "Alan: Good. Because Harley Cooper and the Cooper family are trying to tear down our legacy, and you are the one who must stop them.",
        "Alan-Michael: You mean it is all up to me? I sure wish you would have taught me how Spaulding works. I'm not sure I'm up to it.",
        "Alan: Of course you are. You're a Spaulding. Now would you stop this abandoned child thing.",
        "Alan-Michael: Don't tell me what to do. I don't owe you a damn thing. I'm going along just fine in my life.",
        "Alan: Are you? You have money, but do you have everything you that you truly want?",
        "Alan-Michael: You have no idea what I want. You can't hurt me. You can't shut me down. I don't need you anymore.",
        "Alan: Well, I need you, son. Now are you going to turn your back on your own family?",
        "Alan-Michael: That's a tough one. Why don't we flip for it. I could help you or let you rot in jail.",
        "Alan: Wait. Our family future hinges on the flip of a coin?",
        "Alan-Michael: Call it.",
        "Alan: Heads.",
        "Alan-Michael: Heads it is. You win.",
        "Alan: I've got to get out of the institution. And I'll come and relieve you at the company. So keep my chair warm.",
        "Alan-Michael: A seat warmer, yeah, I think I can do that, Dad.",
        "Alexandra: This isn't right. You've missed something, Ian.",
        "Ian Tanner: I assure you, the instructions were quite clear.",
        "Lizzie: That's all Granddad left him, a dime. Alan-Michael was his son.",
        "Ian Tanner: Mrs. Spaulding, please, there is more.",
        "Alexandra: I knew Alan had a terrible sense of humor. What did he say.",
        "Ian Tanner: To make sure Alan-Michael was given this dime heads up. Does that mean anything to you?",
        "Alan-Michael: Yes, it does.",
        "Alexandra: Well, we're going to contest it.",
        "Ian Tanner: I'm afraid there is nothing to contest. Mr. Spaulding will continue to enjoy his current lifestyle, but all he gets from his dad's will is one dime. ( Yelling )",
        "Alan-Michael: Everybody just calm down. He and I were never close. I grew up without him, and half the time I was here, he was in prison. I'm just glad he didn't cut me out of the will entirely. I got a dime, and every last penny of it is mine. I'm not sharing.",
        "Alexandra: Darling, this is not a laughing matter.",
        "Alan-Michael: Why?",
        "Alexandra: Because you deserve more.",
        "Alan-Michael: Why? Alan knew that money wasn't that important to me. I have what I have, and that is good enough. But my dad always knew if I wanted to build a fortune, that I could do it myself, even if I had to start with one, thin dime.",
        "Alexandra: All right, this is all very noble, darling, but --",
        "Beth: Alexander, don't worry about it. Alan is getting what he deserves, trust me.",
        "Alan-Michael: Thank you, Mr. Tanner.",
        "Marina: Are you sure that you're really okay?",
        "Alan-Michael: Do you want the true me or the nice guy you like so much.",
        "Marina: How about the guy I was just holding hands with.",
        "Alan-Michael: He pushed me down again, Marina. Even from the grave, Alan is still stepping all over me.",
        "Young Alan-Michael: Dad!",
        "Alan: Hey, sport, those meetings took a little longer than I expected. I hope you haven't been waiting too long.",
        "Young Alan-Michael: I can wait.",
        "Alan: Patience, that's what I like about you, Alan-Michael. Come over here. You see this chair that I'm sitting in? It is the most powerful chair in all of Springfield. From this seat, you can look down on everyone else. You know why?",
        "Young Alan-Michael: Why?",
        "Alan: Because that's what Spaulding's do.",
        "Young Alan-Michael: I love that chair.",
        "Alan: You love this chair. One of these days, your brother Phillip will be sitting in this that chair.",
        "Young Alan-Michael: What about me?",
        "Alan: You will have a scrapbook of Phillip twice the size you have of mine.",
        "Marina: You took off so fast, I thought I lost you.",
        "Alan-Michael: It's not about the money, you know.",
        "Marina: I know.",
        "Alan-Michael: I made a scrapbook of everything he did when I was a kid. I tried to be happy or tough, tried to be smart, whatever I thought he wanted. It was never enough.",
        "Marina: Because you would never be Phillip.",
        "Alan-Michael: I'd never be anybody. I was a stranger whenever I showed up at that house. Sometimes new people were on the staff and they didn't even know who I was.",
        "Marina: Well, ask me.",
        "Alan-Michael: What?",
        "Marina: Ask me who you are. And I'll tell you. Not just the obvious things, like your good looks or your great suits. I'm talking about the real stuff. Like the way you wash dishes. You remember that night at Company when you helped me close? It took us forever because you had to wash every glass just right. You're like that with everything. You care how things affect other people. You remember Zach's favorite bed-time story, and you always buy Lizzie her favorite candy you used to buy her when she was little. Things that most people don't think are very important, but it makes people feel very special.",
        "Alan-Michael: Marina, there is something --",
        "Marina: No. You always pick apart your caesar salad so there is always enough dressing. It drives me insane. And I know your favorite color has to be blue because you always take the blue piece of gum or the blue piece of candy out of the candy pack. Now, I could go on, but I think you get the idea. I'm really sorry that your father didn't pay attention to you, Alan-Michael, but I do. I do pay attention. And it's these things that I see that make me believe that you are going to be a truly great man.",
        "Alan-Michael: It's my turn.",
        "Marina: For what?",
        "Alan-Michael: I love how you get what you want all the time without being pushy. I like that you're a cop from a cop family, and that makes me feel safe.",
        "Marina: Stop.",
        "Alan-Michael: I do like that you're not someone who chases happiness; you know how to create it. If any woman could save a man, that woman would be you.",
        "Marina: Well, I don't see a man who needs saving. You know, Harley is going to be putting you in charge of that company today. Even though it's only temporary, Spaulding will never be the same once she walks away.",
        "Alan-Michael: Right.",
        "Marina: You are going to be the best Spaulding there ever was, you know? Because you don't need power to justify who you are.",
        "Alan-Michael: You've got a lot of faith in me.",
        "Marina: Well, it's worked for me so far.",
        "Marina: I'm sorry. Did I say something wrong?",
        "Alan-Michael: About what? No. Why?",
        "Marina: I don't know. We were just talking about you handing the company back over to Harley and you got tense. I mean, did I put words into your mouth or something? I don't know. You fought hard for Spaulding before, maybe...",
        "Alan-Michael: Yeah, but I'm not fighting for it now. I'm sorry, it is just Alan's will, and all of the stuff you've been saying is what I've been saying all along. You know the company is a drag for me.",
        "Marina: Okay, good. Then you'll do your duty, and still stay true to yourself. Proving I know you like a book.",
        "Alan-Michael: Um, press conference.",
        "Marina: Right. But that's not until later, right, so...",
        "Alan-Michael: Yeah, but there is something I've got to do before.",
        "Marina: Okay. All right. Well, then, I'll meet you there.",
        "Alan-Michael: I wouldn't want to be there without you.",
        "Marina: Well good. And afterwards, I'll meet you here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: \"Alan Brandon Spaulding, beloved father, grandfather, husband.\" You always were inseparable. Don't worry, Alan. I'll pay for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Hey, the flower is a nice touch.",
        "Alan-Michael: Thanks.",
        "Marina: Here, this is for you. For luck.",
        "Alan-Michael: Are you in my head?",
        "Marina: I don't know. It looks like the car you were driving the night we met up again, and it just reminded me of us. I hope it does the same for you.",
        "Alan-Michael: It reminds me of a lot of things. Thank you. You're amazing.",
        "Harley: Hey, you ready?",
        "Alan-Michael: Yeah, let's get it over with.",
        "Harley: All right.",
        "Alan-Michael: Hey, hey, is my tie okay?",
        "Marina: Yeah, of course.",
        "Alan-Michael: It doesn't make me look like I'm in prep school?",
        "Marina: No, you look great.",
        "Audience: Mr. Spaulding! ( Yelling )",
        "Alexandra: Don't forget, darling, you and I are going to have a talk after this is over.",
        "Harley: Ladies and gentlemen, I'll make this brief. As you know, I am temporarily stepping down as CEO of Spaulding Enterprises, and while the people running it in my absence are capable and reliable, a more official appointment is required to show that one strong voice is steering this magnificent ship. In my place will be someone that I have come to trust, someone with a head for business and a heart for management, a true leader. Ladies and gentlemen, Dinah Marler. ( Yelling )",
        "Reporter: Is that confirmed? Can we have a comment.",
        "Dinah: I have no comment to make.",
        "Harley: Congratulations.",
