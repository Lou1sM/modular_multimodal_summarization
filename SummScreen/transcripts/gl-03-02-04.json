        "Ross: Hello, Phillip.",
        "Phillip: Hi, Ross.",
        "Ross: How's my favorite nephew?",
        "Phillip: Fine.",
        "Ross: So, I got a call from Dr. Langham, and he said that you wanted to see me, and it has been a while since our last visit. So here I am. Blake sends her regards. She says hello, sent these with me. Darn, I'm sorry -- I was gong to bring it with me. Clarissa painted you quite the work of art. She says it's a painting of Zach, but it looks more like our cat, actually. So next time, my next visit, I'll bring it along and I'll let you decide who it is. The kids miss you.",
        "Phillip: The kids.",
        "Ross: Mine. Yours. They're all looking forward to your homecoming.",
        "Phillip: I want to be home with my kids. Olivia... I just... I have to be sure.",
        "Ross: Sure of what?",
        "Phillip: The will.",
        "Ross: Well, you don't have anything to worry about with that. I drew it up originally and I updated it not that long ago.",
        "Phillip: No, she... Olivia had me sign another will. For her and for our children.",
        "Ross: Olivia had a new will drawn up?",
        "Phillip: Yeah. And I agreed.",
        "Ross: You did?",
        "Phillip: Yeah.",
        "Ross: Maybe I should take a look at that to make sure that Olivia didn't forget anything.",
        "Phillip: Well, see, yeah, I need your help. Because, see, she's my wife, you know. I have to trust her.",
        "Olivia: Hello.",
        "Cassie: Hello.",
        "Olivia: You know, I've been meaning to talk to you. I wanted to thank you for covering for me at The Beacon. I haven't exactly been pulling my weight lately and I appreciate your help. So I owe you.",
        "Cassie: You don't owe me. The Beacon is fine. I know you have some other issues that you're dealing with.",
        "Olivia: Emma misses you. And you haven't been by to see her lately. It's amazing, you know, how babies can form attachments with people. I just... I hope you're not going to take out your anger at me on her.",
        "Cassie: Oh, come on, Olivia. Don't be ridiculous. Look, don't try and make me feel guilty about Emma. All right? She doesn't need me. She needs her father and Phillip needs her.",
        "Olivia: I know that, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Okay, so what's it going to be?",
        "Olivia: Boy, you just don't let up.",
        "Cassie: Not when I think I'm right, no, I don't.",
        "Olivia: Look, I'm almost there, all right? I just have one little thing that I have to do before I tell Phillip that Emma's alive.",
        "Cassie: No. You have to tell Phillip about his daughter. Not next week, not tomorrow, but now.",
        "Alan: Gus, there must be a mistake here because I don't own the fairgrounds. I was there because I was interested in buying it.",
        "Gus: Yeah, well, this deed says otherwise. See, you can't buy something you already own.",
        "Alan: Let me look at it.",
        "Gus: It's a weird coincidence, huh? Ed, Josh, Billy, Buzz, all hanging out at the old fairgrounds when that woman was killed, and then you show up and you just happen to be the landlord? And you show up at the same exact time? I find that very interesting.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Marah, let's... let's talk about...",
        "Marah: Jeffrey, please. I'd like to see my father.",
        "Jeffrey: I know you want to see him, but you can't.",
        "Marah: I just... I want to talk to him, make sure that he's okay.",
        "Jeffrey: He's holding up fine. He's a strong man. Don't worry.",
        "Marah: He's a good man. He's a man that does not deserve to be sitting in a jail cell. You know that as well as I do.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, listen, I've got a job to do and it concerns trying to find the truth here and doing what's best for everyone.",
        "Marah: What's best is to send my father home.",
        "Jeffrey: Marah, I can't. Okay? I can't. This is my job, you know? I've got a job to do.",
        "Marah: Right, your job. Nothing is more important than the job.",
        "Jeffrey: Marah, it seems a woman is dead, but all the circumstances leading up to her death, well, it leads me to believe that... Well, let's just say that there are a few missing pieces. All I have is the word of your father and those other men. Their stories, their stories about what happened, their stories about what led up to their meeting with Caroline Caruthers at that fairgrounds that night, their stories about what actually happened there when they were confronted with her. I've got a lot of stories. I don't have a lot of facts, facts that can support the truth.",
        "Marah: You don't think that they're telling you the truth?",
        "Jeffrey: I don't know if they are or if they aren't. That's why I need all the help I can get. You can help me, Marah. Help me help your father. Tell me what you know about that night, the night that Caroline Caruthers was shot.",
        "Marah: I didn't want to see this.",
        "Jeffrey: What?",
        "Marah: You don't care about me. You don't care about my father. Everyone else was right. You will do anything, use anybody that you have to, in order to close a case. You're going to use everything that I say to convict my father. You didn't bring me in here to try and make me feel better or console me or tell me that you're going to do everything that you can. You brought me in here to help you make a case against my own father.",
        "Jeffrey: I wish you could understand how incredibly difficult this is for me. I know what you've been through these last few months. Do you really think that I would want to bring more pain into your life?",
        "Marah: You know what, Jeffrey? Honestly, I don't really remember that much about what happened that night. I was at home watching a movie with Michelle and Marina until Michelle's father came over and told me about the meeting and the shooting of Caroline. After that, it... it's pretty hazy. I don't know. I think I went into shock or something.",
        "Jeffrey: So you can't remember exactly what Dr. Bauer said because you were in shock?",
        "Marah: I told you what I remember. Why do you keep looking at me like I'm lying to you?",
        "Jeffrey: It's not that. I just... I'm desperate for answers, and, well, you're just not giving me the missing puzzle piece.",
        "Marah: Sorry.",
        "Jeffrey: Do you really think I want to hurt your father? Nothing would make me happier than to be able to declare this a clear-cut case of self-defense, release Josh, and we can all get back to our lives.",
        "Marah: Then do it.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, it's not that easy. So, please tell me again. Dr. Bauer arrived at the Museum.",
        "Marah: My dad sent him there to find me and Shayne, but Shayne wasn't there. He wanted Ed to tell us what happened before we saw it on the news or something. Ed told us that my dad shot Caroline Caruthers. It was self- defense. He had no other choice.",
        "Jeffrey: Marah, did you know Caroline Caruthers?",
        "Marah: She was stalking my dad.",
        "Jeffrey: And your dad never told you about her before all this happened?",
        "Marah: No. No, he didn't. He wouldn't want to worry us.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, he wouldn't want to worry you, but your dad would do anything to protect you, wouldn't he?",
        "Marah: Yeah, that's what families do.",
        "Jeffrey: What? Keep secrets?",
        "Marah: No, protect each other.",
        "Jeffrey: Did you tell your dad that you were being stalked?",
        "Marah: I wasn't being stalked. That was just a stupid prank that my brother was playing with a doll.",
        "Jeffrey: A stupid prank with a doll and a razor blade.",
        "Marah: It was an accident.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, but your dad being stalked, that's the real thing, right?",
        "Marah: Yes.",
        "Jeffrey: Did you ever think that maybe what happened to you and what's happened to your father might be connected?",
        "Marah: No. Why are you trying to twist my words around? You're trying... you're trying to get a motive from me? Are you trying to make things worse than they already are?",
        "Jeffrey: I'm trying to help you and I'm trying to help your dad, but I can't do it until I know the truth, until I find out what really happened, Marah.",
        "Marah: Jeffrey, I already told you everything that I remember, everything that I know.",
        "Jeffrey: No, you haven't. Your dad's covering something up, you're not telling the truth, he's trying to protect you, and you think you're protecting him. But what you're really doing is you're making it a lot worse for everyone.",
        "Alan: Let me go over this one more time, Gus. I was out at the fairgrounds scouting out some property I was interested in. I had no idea I owned it.",
        "Gus: You didn't know you owned it? How is that possible?",
        "Alan: Look, I have a large portfolio. I can't keep track of every piece of property that I have. I mean, I'm sure this was purchased in a larger deal or something. Oh, no? Well, then why don't you tell me where it came from, then, huh?",
        "Gus: The MC Corporation.",
        "Alan: The what?",
        "Gus: MC Corporation. Think about it. Does it ring a bell?",
        "Alan: No. Never heard of it.",
        "Gus: Something just doesn't feel right. Do you mind? Alan, I've been around you for a while now, okay? I've been around long enough to know that you are a detail-oriented freak. I've been with you when you have changed the placement of the soap in the Men's Executive Washroom, so do not tell me that you don't know what's going on in your own company.",
        "Alan: I can tell you one thing: I had no idea about this particular deal.",
        "Gus: Okay, let's say that that's possible, okay? But there is something that you are not telling me. Something. So why don't you just come clean? You know, now would be a really good time. In fact, I really highly recommend it.",
        "Alan: \"Come clean?\" Gus, what is this? An interrogation or something? If you think I am somehow connected to that woman's death, why don't you be man enough and come out and say it?",
        "Ross: Phillip, I didn't mean to say that you shouldn't trust Olivia. I'm sure that whoever she got to draw up this will is just top-notch. I simply think it's a good idea for me to look it over. Look, I mean, I still am your personal attorney, aren't I?",
        "Phillip: Yes, you are. So could you ask Olivia?",
        "Ross: Okay, I will. I'm sure she'll be fine with it. I assumed that the changes were made to make sure that she was provided for.",
        "Phillip: No, not her. Just the children.",
        "Ross: Well, you don't have to worry about that. The original will had provisions for Lizzie, James, Zach.",
        "Phillip: No, the other children.",
        "Ross: Is Olivia pregnant?",
        "Phillip: No.",
        "Ross: Then what other children?",
        "Phillip: We'll have them to make up for... My daughter died. My little baby died.",
        "Ross: I'm sorry.",
        "Phillip: Yeah.",
        "Ross: I'm sorry, I didn't know. I'll do whatever I can to help you.",
        "Phillip: You will? Thank you. Is that a newspaper?",
        "Ross: Yeah. Yeah, it is.",
        "Phillip: I haven't seen one of those in a while. I have a hard time focusing.",
        "Ross: Would you like me to bring you up to date on anything?",
        "Phillip: Yeah.",
        "Ross: What do you want? The editorials? Sports pages? Headlines?",
        "Phillip: What month is it, Ross?",
        "Ross: It's March. Early March.",
        "Phillip: Is it?",
        "Ross: Yeah. Here we go. (Chuckles) This is fascinating. \"The Marler/Santos race for mayor continues to heat up. However, recent polls show that Ross Marler's popularity is growing by leaps and bounds, and, at the moment, he's the hot pick. If this trend continues, it looks like a handsome win for the handsome, dashing Mr. Marler.\" I made up some of that, and then I embellished it a little more. But I am serious about this election, and that's why I want you out of here soon, so you can get ready to vote, because I am depending on that Spaulding bloc of support. You know that.",
        "Phillip: I'll do my best.",
        "Olivia: How dare you?",
        "Cassie: And how dare you let Phillip and your daughter go through this?",
        "Olivia: Why did I think you could ever understand?",
        "Cassie: No, what I understand is right now you are playing some kind of controlling game.",
        "Olivia: No, it is no game, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: I thought you were going to tell Phillip the truth about his daughter.",
        "Olivia: No, the way I remember it, you made that decision for me.",
        "Cassie: Obviously not, because you haven't done a damn thing about it. Phillip is rotting in that hospital room! That man is in so much pain, and you could stop the pain, but you refuse to.",
        "Olivia: No! I just refuse to do it on your timetable when I know what's best for my family.",
        "Cassie: Now there's the control again.",
        "Olivia: Oh, God, shut up! You know, if you were really my friend...",
        "Cassie: You make it hard to be your friend, you know? Sometimes you really do.",
        "Olivia: Well, then don't trouble yourself. Why don't you go play with your real friends, Harley and Blake.",
        "Cassie: Oh, stop. Okay? Just stop it. You want to know something, Olivia? Friends tell each other the truth and friends help each other make tough decisions and tough choices, and right now you don't have any. Either you tell Phillip about his daughter or I will.",
        "Marah: Why do you have to be so suspicious? Why can't you just believe what my dad is telling you?",
        "Jeffrey: I think you know why: Because there's more to this story than people are letting on. And the stories don't add up, okay? They don't make sense. A woman starts stalking your father because of a botched job interview. Josh then agrees to meet with this woman in the middle of nowhere with his brother and a few of his not-so-close friends. People show up with guns, and suddenly we've got a shoot-out at the OK Corral. Gee, what's wrong with that picture?",
        "Marah: Sometimes fact is stranger than fiction.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, not this time, Marah. There's something about this story... there's something about this story that people don't want to talk about, okay? Maybe there was more of a plan than people wanted to let on.",
        "Marah: You think my father was planning to kill this woman?",
        "Jeffrey: That's not what I said. But something drove that woman to the edge and something drove your father over it.",
        "Marah: Yeah, she was crazy. It was self-defense. How many more times do I have to tell you he had no other choice?",
        "Jeffrey: How do you know that, Marah?",
        "Marah: Because Ed told me.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, and you believe Ed.",
        "Marah: Yeah. Why wouldn't I? You know what? I've got to go.",
        "Jeffrey: (Sighs) Can't you understand? I want to help you. I want to protect you. And I want to make this all go away.",
        "Marah: You could. But you won't. How could I ever let myself care about you? You know what? I was wrong. I thought that there was a person in there somewhere. You warned me. You did. But I wouldn't listen, no, because I saw someone, something that I wanted and I let myself care for him. Because I thought... I thought you were strong and wonderful and I thought you could take care of me. But it turns out I made it all up in my head. You're not real. There's not even a person in there. What was I thinking?",
        "Jeffrey: Marah. Marah.",
        "Alan: Well, well, well. I should have known all along.",
        "Gus: What are you talking about? You should have known what?",
        "Alan: All these assurance you've been giving me that you respect me, that you trust me. Oh, no, you never did. It's all a big game to you, Detective. You've been waiting for me to slip up, haven't you? Yes, so it would prove what everyone says about Alan Spaulding: That he's immoral, he's duplicitous. It has all been a big test to you, hasn't it?",
        "Gus: Alan, you've got it all wrong. This has nothing to do with you and me.",
        "Alan: No, no, it has nothing to do with me. It has something to do with you -- the very core of who you are. Now you're trying to nail your future father-in- law, Buzz, not only me.",
        "Gus: I'm not trying to nail anybody, okay?",
        "Alan: Oh, no, no, not at all. As matter of fact, you're just doing your job. It's the law, Detective Aitoro. You can't even turn off being a cop when your own family is involved.",
        "Gus: Maybe I can't... maybe I can't.",
        "Alan: No. No, you can't. Because you're tough, aren't you? I used to be proud of that. I thought you were noble. I thought you were strong. I see that toughness now is nothing but feelings that are rigid and suspicious.",
        "Gus: Why... why are you making this personal? Okay, this is just business.",
        "Alan: Exactly. For you. Because I would never do this to anybody that I loved.",
        "Gus: Why don't you just tell me what happened? Just tell me the truth. We can face this together, whatever it is. Whatever it is. Right, right?",
        "Olivia: Ross, hi. What a nice surprise.",
        "Ross: Hello, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: How's the campaign going?",
        "Ross: Very well. Thank you. In fact, I just got Phillip's vote.",
        "Olivia: Oh, good. Well, mine... mine, too. And I have to say it looks like marriage agrees with you.",
        "Ross: I could say the same about you. Well, Phillip, I should be going.",
        "Phillip: Okay. Thanks for everything, Ross.",
        "Ross: Yeah. Now I'm going to come back soon, and when I do, I will bring Clarissa's painting, all right? My little girl is one of Phillip's biggest fans.",
        "Olivia: Well, then we have something in common.",
        "Ross: Yes. See you. Olivia, could I see you out here for a minute?",
        "Olivia: Sure. Honey, I'll be right back.",
        "Ross: Bye, Phillip.",
        "Olivia: What is it?",
        "Ross: Phillip told me about the new will. Now, I have always handled his personal business affairs, for over twenty years, in fact. So, I was a little surprised.",
        "Olivia: I'm sorry. Look the last thing we wanted to do was to offend you. We just thought you were very busy with the campaign.",
        "Ross: I am. But still I could look it over.",
        "Olivia: It's not necessary. I mean, really, it's straight forward stuff, and we're pretty confident that everything is in order.",
        "Ross: Well, can you include Phillip in that? He remains rather confused about things.",
        "Olivia: I know. I just... It's really nothing to worry about. He's still recovering, but things are getting clearer a little each day, you know? I'm taking good care of him.",
        "Ross: Well, continue to do that. I'm very fond of my nephew.",
        "Olivia: Me, too.",
        "Ross: Well, then, I will be in touch.",
        "Olivia: Okay. Anytime. Hello to Blake.",
        "Ross: Yes.",
        "Olivia: Hi, honey. Listen, there's something that I need to talk to you about, and I hope you could understand.",
        "Phillip: What is it?",
        "Olivia: Something's come up. Some business overseas. I'm going to have to go away for a little while.",
        "Phillip: Oh, you're leaving? For how long?",
        "Olivia: I'm not exactly sure. It's just a business trip. I'll be back.",
        "Phillip: When?",
        "Olivia: As soon as I can.",
        "Phillip: Yeah. Yeah, we just got married.",
        "Olivia: I know. I know. And I'll miss you.",
        "Phillip: No, no, I'll be alone.",
        "Olivia: No, you're not going to be alone. You're not. This is like Grand Central Station around here. Are you kidding? You're going to have Rick and Ross and... You know what? I'll talk to Dr. Langham before I leave and tell him that maybe it's time to open up visits to some family members. You would like that, wouldn't you?",
        "Phillip: Yeah, because I'd like to make everything right. I would. For you...",
        "Olivia: That's what we both want.",
        "Phillip: Right. But I'm away from my kids, and you don't have any. You're alone. You're all alone. And I know we have each other, um, but... Okay. You're going away...",
        "Olivia: It's just... It's a business trip, Phillip. That's all. I'll be back.",
        "Phillip: Right. Okay. But when you get back, we'll talk about children. Because you need a family.",
        "Olivia: God, I can't do this.",
        "Phillip: I've got to...",
        "Olivia: Don't. Stop it. Just stop it. Stop it. I can't do this anymore. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.",
        "Alan: Well, it seems I already own the fairgrounds. Yeah, some deed transfer from the MC Corporation or something.",
        "Buzz: MC? Maryanne Caruthers?",
        "Alan: That woman is blowing my alibi even from the grave.",
        "Buzz: Wow! That is impressive.",
        "Alan: Gus doesn't buy any of our stories. He looked at me as if I was some kind of criminal or stranger. All this time... all this time that I've spent trying to gain his respect and trust, now it's slipping away all because of something that happened thirty damn years ago.",
        "Buzz: (Laughs)",
        "Alan: What are you laughing at? This is serious, Buzz.",
        "Buzz: Welcome to Hell.",
        "Alan: What do you mean \"welcome to Hell?\" I've been a part of this with you guys ever since the beginning.",
        "Buzz: No, you haven't. It's one thing to have a noose around your neck, but another to have it around your heart -- then you feel it.",
        "Alan: I could lose my son. What can I do?",
        "Buzz: Get a grip, Alan.",
        "Alan: What do you mean \"get a grip?\" I'm losing my son!",
        "Buzz: \"Get a grip.\" That's what you told me and Ed and Josh when Carrie was targeting our families, when our girls were on the line. Now, it's your turn.",
        "Alan: You're really enjoying this, aren't you?",
        "Buzz: \u0091Joy' wouldn't be the word, I... No. Carrie's twisted revenge is one thing, but we all have to do our penance. Why should you be left out?",
        "Alan: Oh, come on, you really don't believe that.",
        "Buzz: We all got to eek out a second chance, didn't we? Gus even saved your soul in the Eleventh Hour, just in time for Judgment Day. I don't feel sorry for any of us, but especially not you.",
        "Alan: We all walked away from that car that night, Buzz.",
        "Buzz: There's a difference: When you walked away, you didn't feel a thing. Now you do. Better late than never.",
        "Gus: You look about as bad as I feel.",
        "Jeffrey: Hello, Gus. What's up?",
        "Gus: I hate this job.",
        "Jeffrey: You're not on the job.",
        "Gus: You know what I mean.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, I know what you mean.",
        "Gus: And this Caroline Caruthers case, it just sucks.",
        "Jeffrey: You think that, hmm, with a confession and three corroborating witnesses that a case would be easy to close.",
        "Gus: Yeah, well, not when you think everybody's lying to you.",
        "Jeffrey: I think you've been talking to your dad about his alibi.",
        "Gus: I've been doing a little more than that. I found out that Alan actually owns the fairgrounds that he said he was look at the night of the shooting.",
        "Jeffrey: That's interesting.",
        "Gus: \"Interesting?\" I found out that the deed was transferred to him from MC Corporation. That doesn't ring a bell with you, does it? The MC Corporation.",
        "Jeffrey: As a matter of fact, it does.",
        "Gus: Well, you want to fill me in?",
        "Jeffrey: All right, Aitoro, we've come this far together, I might as well take you along for the rest of the ride.",
        "Cassie: Hi. Hey. You're upset about your dad, aren't you?",
        "Marah: And Jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, this thing been going on for a lot of years. It's been bubbling underneath the surface ready to explode, and it touches a lot of people that we both know.",
        "Gus: All right, well, how much of this time bomb is tied to my father?",
        "Jeffrey: He helped set it. Remember when we fished that car out of the bottom of the river not too long ago, and I asked you to ask your father about a particular woman?",
        "Gus: Yeah, Maryanne Caruth... the MC Corporation. And how is she tied to Caroline?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, Caroline is Maryanne's aunt.",
        "Gus: How bad is this?",
        "Jeffrey: You know, I've been holding on to this story for quite awhile now, and we can stop right here if you want, Gus, okay? You're not on the force anymore. This is not your case. You know, you don't have to do anything. You stand by your dad, and it's your call.",
        "Gus: Just get it on with it, all right?",
        "Jeffrey: A little while back I got a call from Caroline Caruthers.",
        "Gus: You have been in touch with the victim?",
        "Jeffrey: She had a little story she wanted to tell. It took place nearly thirty years ago. It took place also at the fairgrounds one night on the outskirts of town.",
        "Gus: At our crime scene.",
        "Jeffrey: Caroline and her niece Maryanne went to the fairgrounds that night, the night Maryanne met up with the five men. Maryanne never made it home that night. Maryanne would never make it home again.",
        "Alan: If you can't forgive me, how will my son?",
        "Jeffrey: All right, so fast forward nearly thirty years, and Carrie decides that she wants to exact some revenge. She lost someone that she loved very much to these men. So, what better way to exact revenge than to get close to the people that these men loved the most? Their children and grandchildren. As for what happened at the fairground, well, let's just say that it did not go down the way that these men said it did. So that's it. Two crimes. Two women dead. Five men involved.",
        "Gus: And one of those men is my father.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm sorry, Gus.",
        "Cassie: You know what? You have been through so much, Marah. And you have so much going on. You really need to give yourself a break.",
        "Marah: Thank you, but I'm not going to let myself do this. I can't give in to this. So I'll be fine and I'll see you later. Thank you for listening.",
        "Olivia: This is your daughter. This is Emma.",
        "Reva: Next on Guiding Light...",
        "Olivia: Our baby's alive, Phillip.",
        "Phillip: This baby isn't mine.",
        "Marah: And now...",
        "Jeffrey: And now, if I do what you've asked me to do, and if I keep looking, I'm going to find the truth -- and neither of us is going to like it."
