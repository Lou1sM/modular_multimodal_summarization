Listen, I had an idea that i wanted to throw past you, see what you thought about it. Um... I was thinking about taking company and making it into a male strip club. Now hear me out here. We'll get the jungle people, the ymca theme, we'll get guys on the tables, we'll rock this place. We'll have a lot of fun with it. We'll... look, forget it. This just sounded funnier in my head. The point is you're dodging me right now, lizzie, I know, and, frankly, I wouldn't want to see or talk to or even be around me either after what happened. But I'm worried about you. Okay? Could you please stop by company? Fire me, something, let me know you're okay, all right? Call me.", "Frank: She admits to shooting phillip, she says she did it and now she wants a plea deal.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: It's not going to end like this.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: You two have to stop this. I did it! I killed phillip, okay? I did it. I'm not going to debate this with you, frank. I have too much to do. Now, we're done. It's over. ( Cell phone rings )", "Alan: Alan spaulding.", "Harley: It's harley.", "Alan: Oh?", "Harley: I need to see you.", "Alan: Really?", "Harley: I need to give you something you want.", "Alan: The only thing I want, harley, is to see you behind bars.", "Harley: Meet me at my office. Come alone.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Coop: Lizzie, don't!", "Lizzie: What? Coop, knock it off!", "Coop: Listen, life turn out okay. This is not the answer, lizzie, all right? There's so much to live for.", "Lizzie: What are you doing?", "Coop: Look, your family, they love you, all right? Your little dog, the mutt, that loves you, too. Don't think if you take a concrete dive off the building that I'm going to walk in and feed it or whatever. Gosh, there's so much to live for, lizzie. This world is not going to be a better place without you.", "Lizzie: So, the whole world, are you involved in that?", "Coop: What do you mean?", "Lizzie: Well, say I would just be gone tomorrow, would you care?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Yeah, I think the chocolate hit someone on the hand. You'll have a lawsuit on your hands.", "Olivia: Aren't you leaving?", "Bill: Okay, look, I gambled. I took a shot at trying to help harley.", "Olivia: You gambled and lost. Harley looks guilty and I found out I can't trust my husband.", "Bill: You're fine. We should be fine. You're still running spaulding enterprises, you still have your daughter.", "Olivia: For now, bill.", "Bill: For good, olivia. Alan cannot take emma away from you. He can'T.", "Olivia: You don't know that. You don't know that! And he could pull the business out from under me, bill. He could take away everything that I'm working for.", "Bill: Would that be so terrible?", "Olivia: Does it matter to you what I want?", "Bill: What are you talking about? Of course it matters. You don't think it matters to me? You matter. Look, you matter.", "Olivia: It's pretty.", "Bill: You're pretty.", "Olivia: I... I really do have a lot of work.", "Bill: Well, then can I pass on you for a makeup session tonight or... maybe?", "Olivia: Just go, go. I'm going to be angry with you for a little while longer.", "Bill: Hey, I'm sorry.", "Olivia: Yeah, whatever that is I'd like it off my desk.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sebastian: Well, I figured I'd save your investigators the trouble. There you go. In that file, everything you ever wanted to know about sebastian hulce. ( Knock at the door )", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: I hope you didn't invite me here looking for mercy.", "Harley: I don't want your mercy or your pity, alan.", "Alan: Then what do you want?", "Harley: I'm tired of fighting. I'm going to take the plea the D.A. Offered.", "Alan: You're saying you killed phillip?", "Harley: I am going to sign a piece of paper that says I'm guilty.", "Alan: Why?", "Harley: Because I remember what happened the night of the shooting.", "Alan: You remember shooting phillip, huh?", "Harley: I remember the feeling of the gun in my hand. I remember pulling the trigger and leaving phillip on the floor to die. There. You finally have justice for your son. But before you go, there is something I want from you in return.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: Well, you understand why I had to investigate you, right?", "Sebastian: Did you see the section on former girlfriends.", "Olivia: Oh, yeah. Very interesting group.", "Sebastian: Oh, yeah. Olivia, my dear. I know you don't trust me.", "Olivia: Well, don't take that personally. I don't trust anyone anymore.", "Sebastian: I want to be a friend.", "Olivia: Sure you do. To alan.", "Sebastian: No, to you.", "Olivia: Really?", "Sebastian: Uh-huh.", "Olivia: Well, in that case I'll give you my skate key and we'll have sleepovers and we'll have so much fun.", "Sebastian: Look, I know we started off on the wrong foot so can we just start over again, please? Sebastian hulce, not a threat.", "Olivia: Olivia lewis. We'll see.", "Sebastian: Touch\u00e9. No rush. I figure we have all the time in the world to get to know each other.", "Olivia: Well, I doubt that, but....", "Sebastian: I'm banking on my office being right next door to yours.", "Olivia: ( Laughs ) what did you say?", "Sebastian: I'm sorry. I guess I didn't properly reintroduce myself. Sebastian hulce, your new co- president.", "Olivia: Would you care? I mean, who would care if I was gone, right?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Coop: Would I care? Lizzie, I just saved you from jumping off this building.", "Lizzie: Yeah, but what if you were too late. I could have been splattered all over the sidewalk already. Really, think about it, coop, you could have been too late. I could have been dead already and even worse I could have been in a coma for years. You could have shown up and seen a bunch of cops standing around me shaking their heads. All that's left of me is this cascade couture. How would you feel? Coop:( Laughs ) okay, now i know you're messing with me.", "Lizzie: I'm sorry to ruin your heroic event. I would never jump off a roof, are you stupid?", "Coop: My heroic fantasy. You didn't seem to mind me laying on top of you, did you?", "Lizzie: Shut up, stop it.", "Coop: You know what, lizzie? I should throw off the building myself now after this.", "Lizzie: First you want to save me now you want to kill me? You say I have problems.", "Coop: What are you doing up here anyways?", "Lizzie: I like the view. Something about looking down on people makes me feel good.", "Coop: That certainly does make sense.", "Lizzie: Why did you think i was up here?", "Coop: Honestly? Because of me.", "Lizzie: Really? You really thought I was going to jump off a roof because you made me mad? I don't think so. I'm rich, I'm blond, I'm rich, I'm young. Did I mention that I'm rich? I mean, hello, I have so many more reasons to live for than you do. You should be taking a swan dive. That would make sense.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: You know, harley, I'm very surprised at you. I thought you would fight this to the bitter end.", "Harley: Well, now that i remember, this is the end and I'm going to confess.", "Alan: In exchange you want something from me. So what is it you want?", "Harley: I heard you talking to gus. I heard you tell him that you would ruin his life and that would you would take zach from my family if I didn't plead out.", "Alan: And you were listening and because of what you heard you're willing to plead guilty?", "Harley: Yes.", "Alan: And in return?", "Harley: I want you leave zach with my family.", "Alan: Zach is my family, too, harley. I love him as much as buzz or frank or anyone else, you know that.", "Harley: Of course. Of course, I don't doubt that you love him. And obviously I would want zach to spend time with the spauldings.", "Alan: But you just want him to be raised by the coopers, is that it?", "Harley: He's used to us. He'S... he's comfortable with how we live, alan. Yes, that's what I want.", "Alan: Why don't you just come out and say it. Say what you mean. You don't want zach to be raised like phillip was, huh?", "Harley: Can you blame me? Alan, zach has already lost his father. He is about to lose his mother. I mean, can the poor child have some consistency in his life, please?", "Alan: Well, what if I were to change my mind while you're in prison?", "Harley: What is wrong with you? You want know take responsibility for killing phillip, I am! That's what I am doing. I am prepared to give up years of my life for this. I am prepared to give up my children and tell them that i killed their father when I don't even know...", "Alan: Harley, wait a minute, is this an act? You don't remember killing phillip, do you?", "Harley: Yes, I do.", "Alan: Tell the truth. You still aren't certain you killed my son.", "Harley: No. I'm not. Coming up on \"guiding light\"...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Coop: Lizzie, I wasn't going to let you fall in a million years.", "Lizzie: I didn't think you would.", "Coop: No, not in a million years.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: You are a cop going to prison. Do you understand this? There's no turning back.", "Harley: There was no turning back from the moment phillip was shot, gus. We never had a case. It's time to accept that this is over.", "Gus: Why would you do this? Why?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: If seeing me behind bars is all you want, then let's make a deal. I will plead guilty. You let zach live his life as a cooper.", "Alan: I don't know, harley. You know, maybe I should just take my chances.", "Harley: What do you mean?", "Alan: Well, your defense is an absolute mess. I mean, you will probably go to jail whether you plead guilty or not. And if you take the deal, that will put you ahead of the game.", "Harley: That's true. But you know, alan, juries are unpredictable. Why would you throw away a sure thing? Take the deal and just leave zach alone.", "Alan: I'm not the monster that you make me out to be. I'm very aware that zach is more comfortable with your family.", "Harley: Then you won't try to take him away from them?", "Alan: I see no reason he can't live with marina, buzz, and frank, no. You in jail is all I want.", "Harley: You're such A... a sad man, alan. You think that punishment and vengeance is all you have left, and that's just not true. Yes, phillip is gone, but you still have gus. He hasn't run away like the others. He is still here.", "Alan: It doesn't matter where gus is. He's lost to me.", "Harley: Gus loved you. Gus saved you. And he saved alexandra. He ruined his own life for you, alan.", "Alan: When will you go to jail?", "Harley: Call jeffrey o'neill tonight. I'm trusting you to keep your word.", "Alan: And I'm trusting you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: So, can we name tall reasons I have more to live for you than? Can we?", "Coop: You know what? As much as I hate to say this, it honestly feels good to have the annoying, the self- appreciating snotty lizzie spaulding back.", "Lizzie: Really? What are you even doing here? I mean, roxie takes better direction than you. Do every time I've told you to get out... what are you doing here now?", "Coop: You know what? I've been wondering the same question myself. I feel rotten about what I did. I really do.", "Harley: Coop, please don't apologize again. You're gonna make me sick.", "Coop: I was desperate to help out my sister harley, so that's why everything happened the way he did.", "Lizzie: Because you love your sister or because you thought it'd help you fit into your family.", "Coop: You'd have to make a horrible psychiatrist.", "Lizzie: Don't pretend like that doesn't strike the truth.", "Coop: Maybe a bit of it does. But all I know is that you started acting a little weird and I put two and two together and I came up with five for some reason. I was irrational and I was stupid.", "Lizzie: I was not acting weird.", "Coop: Come on.", "Lizzie: Okay, so maybe. But you and gus were after me like a bunch of pit bulls. You guys hated me. You still hate me.", "Coop: At first, yes, I admit that. Being around you is like sticking my face in a bag of cats, all right? Hold on. Then things got better and lately there have been moments when...", "Lizzie: When... what? What?", "Coop: When I don't hate you so much. When I don't hate you at all.", "Lizzie: Oh, really?", "Coop: Yeah. I mean, yeah.", "Lizzie: (Laughs) well, thanks for saying that.", "Coop: Thanks for saying what?", "Lizzie: You know, I really should get going. You messed up my outfit earlier and I've got to go get changes. ( Screaming )", "Coop: Lizzie!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: There's no way a co- president could have been hired without my knowledge. No way.", "Alan: Sebastian, are you getting settled in.", "Olivia: Alan, this company is being set up to run by one president. What do you expect sebastian to do?", "Alan: To get you help the workload off your desk.", "Olivia: I can handle everything on my desk.", "Alan: Now you won't have to olivia.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sebastian: I'm already set up in the smaller office next to you, olivia. Because I want to stay as close as possible to you just so I can absorb that spaulding knowledge that's just oozing out of you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: Sit down.", "Gus: Sit down. You're going to listen to me.", "Harley: What are you going?", "Gus: Sit or stand I don't care. You're going to listen to me and cancel that plea, do you understand me?", "Harley: It's too late. I already told alan I shot phillip.", "Gus: Why would you do that? You are a cop going to prison, do you understand that? There's no turning back.", "Harley: There was no turning back from the moment phillip was shot, gus. We never had a case. It's time to accept that this is over.", "Gus: Why would you do this? Why? It'S... if you ever loved me, if you love me, I just... explain it to me. Why?", "Harley: I don'T... I don't have a lot of time left. And I don't want to waste it fighting with you about stuff that we can't change. And I don't want to waste it sitting in a courtroom watching day after day as my hope fades. I want to get to prison so I can get out of prison and be with my kids.", "Gus: I thought we were... I... I thought we were fighting this thing through to the very end. That'S... that'S... that's what we were supposed to do.", "Harley: Do you remember thanksgiving? And you told me that I had to have faith. Well, this is me telling you. Sweetie, you have to find a way to believe that I will be okay. No. No, don'T. Don'T. We both know what I'm going to be doing for the next few years. What we don't know is what you'll be doing. Promise me that you won't make your life a prison. You have a family and they would take you back with open arms if you would give them a chance.", "Gus: That's what this... no. I'm not going back to them.", "Harley: Gus, you have to forgive your father. He's hurt. And he has so much anger inside of him. There was a time when you wanted to save him from that. Remember that? You knew you were doing a good thing, sweetie.", "Gus: I was wrong. I was wrong. It was a waste of my time.", "Harley: Don't say that. It's never... it's never a waste of time to love someone. It's to do what's best for them even when they....", "Harley: Don't, don'T. Not like this. Not like this. No.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: Coop, please....", "Coop: You're fine. I've got you. You've got to reach. Push off.", "Lizzie: Hold me!", "Coop: It's okay. Come on. Come on. I've got you. I've got you. Okay, all right.", "Harley: Thank you so much.", "Coop: Come here. Oh, my gosh, are you okay?", "Lizzie: I slipped.", "Coop: I know you slipped.", "Lizzie: I didn't mean to. You saved my life for real.", "Coop: Lizzie, I wasn't going to let you fall. Not in a million years.", "Coop: Well, I guess I'm forgiven.", "Lizzie: No. No. I mean, maybe. I have to think about it, really. I've got to go. I'm sorry.", "Coop: Work, yeah. I've got to go, too. Do you want a ride?", "Lizzie: I've got to go, coop. I'm sorry.", "Coop: Holy crap. Yeah, I'm in trouble.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Hey.", "Harley: Hey.", "Bill: So what are we doing?", "Harley: We're enjoying the park.", "Bill: Okay.", "Harley: Bill, I'm going to take the D.A.'S plea offer.", "Bill: No, you're not, harley.", "Harley: Yeah, I am.", "Bill: Why? Why would you do that?", "Harley: Because I remember.", "Bill: Remember what?", "Harley: Pulling the trigger.", "Bill: That's not true. Harley... I'm sorry. Phillip, I mean, the guy's in the grave he's still ruining people's lives.", "Harley: You know what? Don't do that. Don't worry about me because i will be fine.", "Bill: Tell me how can I help?", "Harley: Really all I care about is my kids are safe. My children are home, you know? So this way when I think about them I can imagine their birthdays and their christmases.", "Bill: It's done. It's done. And they'll be in a neighborhood that you know very well.", "Harley: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I have to say I'm not thrilled that they'll grow up over company because... well, that's the way I grew up, frank, and I grew up over the diner and I was kind of hoping...", "Bill: You can stop hoping. We're rebuilding your home, harley. It's done.", "Harley: I don't have the money for, that bill.", "Bill: I do.", "Harley: I can't ask you to rebuild my house.", "Bill: You're not asking. We already started. Look, harley, you're going to need a place to come home to. Of course, I was thinking about when you're at the supermarket, but it's done.", "Harley: I'll take it, thank you.", "Bill: Hey, look, it's not like you're falling off the face of the earth here. We're going to come and visit.", "Harley: No. I don't want my kids seeing me locked up.", "Bill: Maybe not now, but when they're older. You can't lie to them their whole lives.", "Harley: Maybe when they're older.", "Bill: Hey, we've always told each other the truth, right? We've always been brutally honest?", "Harley: I guess, yeah.", "Bill: I hate that you're going to jail and I feel terrible for you and your kids, but my life is going on.", "Harley: This is going somewhere, right?", "Bill: What I'm trying to say is I know you have to be strong for gus and your kids and buzz, but you don't have to for me.", "Harley: Tricky.", "Bill: See how I did that? I turned it around. See how I did that? You thought I was going to be a selfish jerk. I'm a lewis, I'm a friend to the end, right?", "Harley: You really are.", "Bill: Yeah. Are you going to let it out, already? Because I'm an ulcer just watching you hold it in. Come here.", "Harley: Um... I'm scared. I'm really scared.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: You're setting me up.", "Alan: For what?", "Lizzie: For some kind of executive cage match with sebastian hulce. You want to throw us in a pit together and see who comes out on top.", "Alan: Well, that's an entertaining idea, olivia, but no.", "Olivia: Yes, you are because of what bill did. You're letting sebastian do your dirty warm, alan?", "Alan: You know I like to do my own dirty work.", "Olivia: Why else would you hire roger thorpe's son?", "Alan: I think he's a very nice guy. Besides, he's nothing like his father.", "Olivia: You once wanted a piece of slingshot. If I gave that to you, would you fire him?", "Alan: Maybe, so you would do that, huh?", "Olivia: No.", "Alan: Well, then I guess I've got myself a new co-president. Now, please, let's not be rude, shall we?", "Olivia: Alan, you said yourself the man is dangerous. Do you even know what he really wants or what he's capable of?", "Alan: No, but it could be fun finding out.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sebastian: Look at this thing. I love it. \"Hello, olivia.\"", "Olivia: Give it to me.", "Sebastian: Is there, like, a company softball game or anything like that?", "Olivia: As much as I'm loving this I have an appointment so by the time I get back I want you both gone.", "Sebastian: No can do, liv. Sorry. You don't mind if I use it while you're gone because they're redoing my office. That girl is high strung. Sexy, but high strung.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: She'd better get over it or she'll get out. It's win-win for me.", "Sebastian: Alan, I am flattered you gave me the position but I'm still surprised because I thought that... well, I expected you'd install your son, gus.", "Alan: Gus is nothing. Nothing to me. And trust me, I'm better off.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Frank: Yes, I'm still on hold. Listen, check the files in my office. I know they're there. Thank you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: ( Nervous laugh )", "Coop: Ted, I'm going to get you guys some refills, all right? Hey, lizzie, can you pass me the coffee pot?", "Lizzie: Take it, take it.", "Coop: Whoa, what's wrong? Are you okay?", "Lizzie: You hurt my shoulder earlier when you body slammed me.", "Coop: Body slammed you? You know what? Next time I see you dangling off a building I'm going to keep on walking.", "Lizzie: You will not. You absolutely love being the hero. You would never pass up a damsel in distress.", "Coop: Really? Whatever you say, lizzie. Whatever you say. I do want to see your shoulder, though, okay? How's this?", "Lizzie: Ow. When did you get your M.D.?", "Coop: Well, I played a lot of rugby back in school, so... well I didn't play. I was injured a lot. So...", "Lizzie: I'd go before you paralyze me or something.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Coop: Yeah.", "Frank: Excuse me.", "Coop: Whoa, easy, frank.", "Frank: Don't think about it, all right?", "Coop: I didn't do anything, though. Get over here.", "Coop: What is the big deal, frank?", "Frank: I'm talking about you and lizzie.", "Coop: There's nothing about me and lizzie.", "Frank: Look at harley and see that the coopers and spauldings are like oil and water. Or oil and fire.", "Coop: I've been at the courtroom; I know what's going on.", "Frank: Let me ask you a question: Do you like lizzie?", "Coop: Frank, no, of course i don'T.", "Frank: Good! Then stop it before it's too late. Do you and your family a huge favor.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: My dad would spin in his grave. My granddad would have another heart attack.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Uh-uh.", "Bill: Look, harley, I know how tough you are.", "Harley: I can'T. I can't do this. I'm not kidding, because I'M... I'M... I can't stop because if i think about what's happening here I'm just going to lose it.", "Bill: Then, harley, lose it!", "Harley: What do you want me to say, bill? I already told you I was scared. Do you want me to tell you that every time I close my eyes i dream that I'm suffocating? That I'm drowning? I'm dying? And even when I open my eyes my nightmare doesn't go away. I am falling, here. It's everything I can do to brace myself.", "Bill: Everyone's going to be there for you. We're all here for you. Everyone who loves you.", "Harley: Yeah, but you can't go with me. I'm going to have to do this on my own and when that cell door closes that first night, something inside me will die. I will never be the same person again, bill.", "Bill: No, but you're going to get out.", "Harley: But my kids won't know me. My kids won't know me anymore.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sebastian: Well, gentlemen, I've got a lot of work to do. So if you'll excuse me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: Well, what are you doing here?", "Gus: What'd you do to harley to make her cop a plea?", "Alan: Nothing. Harley's finally listening to her guilty conscience and facing up to what he's done.", "Gus: That's a load of crap.", "Alan: She's paying her debt to society, to my family and to me.", "Gus: She'd be the only one in town that agrees with that. Remember what it was like before we all hated each other? I wish we could go back to those days. I was trying to get to know you. You'd come over for dinner.", "Alan: Hmm, macaroni and cheese.", "Gus: If I had known that those were actually the good old days, I... I wouldn't have let them slip away. It's all gone now. You hate me and you hate harley. It's all sort of spiraling down the drain. I knew it wouldn't be easy for us, but, I don't know, I never thought it would be like this.", "Alan: I'm sorry. Truly sorry that it's come to this.", "Gus: Can I ask you something? Because I... I kind of... I just have to know. Are you happy now? Does it change anything? Does it bring phillip back? You were right before when you said I'm nothing, because without harley I'M... I'm nothing.", "Alan: Son... there's something you should know.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[NEXT_ON]", "Tammy: Where's mom?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: She's fine. She's safe. And I'm not going to tell any of you where she is.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: I'm merely trying to...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: I don't want you help, okay? I don't want your help because everything single miserable thing that is happening is happening because of you!"], "Transcript Author": ["By Boo"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGtYZqA3_fg"}
