As the DA, he must prosecute Josh, the self-confessed killer of Carrie Caruthers. Suspicions that lead him to wonder if the woman he's falling in love with may be the guilty party.

I had to.", "Phillip: Why?", "Olivia: It was the only way that I knew that I could protect her. It was the only that I knew that I could protect her from lizzie, okay. Do you remember... you remember how tried to hurt our baby before she was even born? I couldn't take the chance if she was going to do that again.", "Phillip: You told me my baby died. (Crying)", "Olivia: I had to tell everyone that our baby died. I wanted to tell you the truth. I swear I did, but I couldn'T. Listen to me. Our baby's alive, phillip, and she's right here. She's ready to meet her daddy.", "Phillip: This baby isn't mine.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cop: Hey, looks who's back.", "Harley: Oh, no...", "Cop: Miss cooper.", "Harley: The only thing i missed was taking your money in that final four pool. Pay up.", "Cop: Oh, that thing was fixed.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Oh, them fighting words. Come on.", "Frank: I know you're not down here looking for a fight.", "Harley: No, I'm down here looking for you.", "Frank: So what's up, sis?", "Harley: You did not just ask me that.", "Frank: Harley.", "Harley: Frank, you know why I'm here. What is going on with our father?", "Frank: I'm conducting an investigation.", "Harley: Oh, no, I know you're conducting an investigation. The problem is, you already have a confession. And on top of that you have witnesses-- our father included-- who say that josh lewis shot that woman in self defense.", "Frank: Wow, that was a nice, little recap. Ever thought about a career in law enforcement?", "Harley: Something's up. And I don't like being kept in the dark.", "Frank: Well, you're asking the wrong person. Jeffrey o'neill is the one running this game.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hotel clerk: Long day, mr. O'neill?", "Jeffrey: You have no idea. Could you send my dinner up to my room and hold the calls, okay?", "Hotel clerk: Of course.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: Mrs. Winslow. Well, I can see by the look on your face that you've heard the news and news spreads like a bad rash in this town. Yes, it's true, I'm holding josh lewis on murder charges.", "Cassie: Marah told me.", "Jeffrey: I really wish i didn't have to pursue this case, but the man did confess to shooting the woman. So it's not like I have a choice.", "Cassie: Not so fast, mr. O'neill.", "Jeffrey: Mrs. Winslow, i totally understand that you want to protect your family, but the law is the law.", "Cassie: The law is the law. Well, that explains everything.", "Jeffrey: What do you want me to do? Do you want me to just turn my back on this? Is that what you want me to do?", "Cassie: No, I don't want you to turn your back. I want you to take a closer look. The woman was killed. But the man you have in prison is the wrong man. Josh didn't do it.", "Jeffrey: Josh didn't do it. Well, how do you know that?", "Cassie: Because I talked to marah.", "Jeffrey: What did she say?", "Cassie: It's not what she said, it's how she said it. And this wasn't a daughter just defending her father. I mean she's is absolutely positive that josh didn't do it.", "Jeffrey: Well, did she say why?", "Cassie: No, she was too upset. I mean since she found out about josh, it's like she's having a posttraumatic stress syndrome. I mean if you would have seen her, you'd know.", "Jeffrey: I did see her. I went over there that night after the shooting. I wanted to help her, you know, deal with the news. And she was pretty shaken up.", "Cassie: I know that you have a job to do, but the way you're handling this case, this isn't like you.", "Jeffrey: You don't know me.", "Cassie: I know one thing. I know that you don't accept the obvious. You walk around town priding yourself on being relentless.", "Jeffrey: Yeah, you pride yourself on giving me a hard time about it, don't you?", "Cassie: Okay, well, maybe i was wrong.", "Jeffrey: You wrong?", "Cassie: Please keep this case open until you have all the facts. Don't do it because I'm asking you to. Do it because you want the truth. You do want the truth, don't you?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Frank: You can't look at that.", "Harley: Neither can you until you hear me out, frank.", "Frank: Excuse me. I have a job to do.", "Harley: And I have a theory.", "Frank: You have a theory. Okay. Let's hear your theory.", "Harley: Jeffery o'neill does not like to lose.", "Frank: That's your big theory? The guy's got that printed on his business card.", "Harley: No, listen to me. Jeffrey o'neill does not like to lose and yet here he is a slam- dunk case handed to him on a silver platter. And what does the man do, frank? What does the man do?", "Frank: So he questions our father again. So what?", "Harley: Exactly. So I smell...", "Frank: Please don't say dirty rat.", "Harley: A hidden agenda.", "Frank: Hidden agendas have smells now?", "Harley: Yes, they do. And I was around this place long enough to know what they smell like. Come on, look at this thing, you and me. Let's get to the bottom of this.", "Frank: May I have my file, please?", "Harley: Frank...", "Frank: My file.", "Harley: Okay, let's forget that we are brother and sister here. Okay. We will discuss this cop to cop.", "Frank: Well, unfortunately you're not a cop anymore.", "Harley: (Gasps)", "Frank: And I can't share anything with you.", "Harley: So there is something to share? So you're saying there's more to this than just a simple case of self defense and our father's involved? And you're not telling me that's really nice, frank.", "Frank: I don't know anything. And if I did know something, i wouldn't be able to tell you.", "Harley: Got it, chief.", "Frank: Harley, just let this go, okay?", "Harley: I'm sorry, but as you so kindly pointed out before, I'm not on your payroll. So, I don't have to take orders from you. Enjoy the file. Gus, be there. Be there. Be there. Be there. Hi, it's me. Listen, the shooting at the fairgrounds just the tip of the iceberg. Ah-huh. Call me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: Phillip, come on, how could you say that? Of course she's yours. Look at her eyes. She has your eyes.", "Phillip: Maybe you felt like bring another baby here would help.", "Olivia: Listen to me. Listen to me. I want you to get out of this place, okay. But I would never ever try and pass off another child as ours. I would never do that to you.", "Phillip: (Crying) but you could tell me that my baby died.", "Olivia: I did what I had to do to protect her. God. Keeping her a secret from you was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. You were so upset when I told you that I lost her. But I couldn'T... I couldn't tell you, okay. I had to be strong.", "Phillip: You had to lie?", "Olivia: It was for our baby's sake.", "Phillip: Why are you... why are you doing this to me now?", "Olivia: Because someone told me that it was the right time. She was right. I took a risk bringing her here tonight. But the fact is, I can't deny you your daughter any longer, okay? And I can't deny emma her daddy.", "Phillip: Emma.", "Olivia: It means whole, universal. And it's true. You know, she has become my whole universe. Do you want to hold her?", "(Baby crying)", "Phillip: It's you. I'm your father.", "Phillip: You're so beautiful.", "Olivia: You know what? She might appear to be very fragile, but she's not. She's strong, like her daddy.", "Phillip: I can't believe you're real.", "Olivia: Look, there's just... there's one thing. We can't tell anybody about her, phillip. All right, lizzie... lizzie hasn't been able to accept this marriage. I don't even want to think about what she'll do when she finds out about emma. Please, I'm worried about how she's going to react and what she might do.", "Phillip: Oh, sweetheart. No, no one will ever hurt you, emma. I promise.", "Olivia: Cassie and sam are the only two people who know about her. She's been living with sam at a house outside of town. I've managed to keep her very safe, phillip. No one else needs to know about her. Phillip, do you understand what I'm saying to you? No one else can know about this baby. Once you're well again, we'll decide when's best.", "Phillip: Yeah. Yeah. It's all about timing.", "Olivia: Yeah, yeah.", "Phillip: Like when you had me sign that new will.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Hi, dad.", "Buzz: Hey.", "Harley: Hey, can I give you a hand?", "Buzz: No, no, no, my daughter. I got it. I got it.", "Harley: Hey... whoa, whoa, whoa. (Laughs) two hands are better than one.", "Buzz: I thought it was two... well, never mind.", "Harley: Well, can I give you some help now?", "Buzz: No, I got it covered. As matter of fact I don't even need this here.", "Harley: So you actually meant to drop these dishes on purpose. Is that it?", "Buzz: Yeah, I was testing. And why are you here? Are you hungry? Because I can always get you...", "Harley: No, I'm not hungry, dad. I came here to see you. And you know it wouldn't hurt for you to take a few days off and let yourself recover.", "Buzz: The work does me good, you know, it keeps my mind off of uh... where's gus?", "Harley: I don't know. That's a good question. He's not answering his pages and that's not like him.", "Buzz: Well, we can track him down together, you know.", "Harley: Are you trying to get rid of me?", "Buzz: No, it's just I don't have much to do for you around here. You know... you know...", "Harley: Really.", "Buzz: Like I said, I have it covered.", "Harley: And, dad.", "Buzz: Yeah.", "Harley: I have you covered. I do. Just the way you had josh's back that other night. I mean, things could have gotten really ugly if you and billy and ed have been there to help him, right?", "Buzz: It did get ugly.", "Harley: That's exactly what I'm saying. I'm saying it could have gotten worse. And I am sure frank has just been hounding you about your service revolver down at the fairgrounds. Has he asked you about that yet?", "Buzz: Oh, he's asked me everything about twice.", "Harley: Exactly. Exactly my point. See I for one I'm glad that you were smart enough to think to bring that down there. Who knows what could have happened? It could have been a lot worse than just a graze on your arm, you know. Thank god, josh was able to stop that woman. But what made you think to bring that gun down there? That's the funny thing because...", "Buzz: Darling, your interrogation skills have gotten sort of rusty.", "Harley: I'm not interrogating anybody.", "Buzz: If you're here to grill a burger, fine. If you're here to grill me then...", "Harley: Dad, we're just talking.", "Buzz: And we're done talking.", "Harley: Fine. Go. No, really go. Because when the going gets tough, the tough sure do always get...", "Buzz: Well, you can't come with me. I mean, you've got gus and kids. You'll hardly know I'm gone.", "Harley: No, I don'T. I want a number. Can you connect me to olympic travel, please? Hi, I need some information on a recent itinerary. Last name cooper.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: You do want the truth, jeffrey, right?", "Jeffrey: Yes, I want the truth, mrs. Winslow. My job as a mater of fact is all about finding the truth, okay. How's that? Is that the answer you were looking for?", "Cassie: I'm looking for an honest answer. And no, I'm not so sure that you just gave me one.", "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, you know, you're not sure about a lot of things. I've always been sure. My whole life I've always been sure. It's always been black and white, good versus evil. No in between, no gray area. No, not in my job, not in my life. Not until now.", "Cassie: Wow. You're really bothered about having to prosecute josh, aren't you?", "Jeffrey: No, I'm not bothered about having prosecute josh.", "Cassie: No, it's not josh. It's having to prosecute marah's father. Wow, I thought there was just some mutual flirtation going on between you two, nothing serious. You really care about her.", "Jeffrey: Look, you know what, mrs. Winslow? When I came to this town, i wanted to stir things up a little bit, light a fire under everybody.", "Cassie: And now?", "Jeffrey: And now if I do what you've asked me to do, if I keep looking, I'm going to find the truth and neither of us is going to like it.", "Cassie: What's going on? Is there something you're not telling me?", "Jeffrey: Yeah, you know, it's just... it's homicide cases... they're murder. Oh, come on, that was pretty funny.", "Cassie: Oh, man. (Laughs)", "Jeffrey: That was pretty funny. I'm serious. These cases, you know, they're not like he said she said, or where's the money. You know with these cases there's always emotions and there's manipulations and it gets to me. It does.", "Cassie: Does it?", "Jeffrey: Yes, it does. Look at your brother-in-law in this case, okay. A deranged woman drove a good man to a bad act and now he's feeling it. His friends are feeling it. His family's feeling it. I mean, give me a corporate trial case any day of the week.", "Cassie: Do you think I'm buying this? Because I'm not. There was genuine pain in your voice when you talked about marah and josh.", "Jeffrey: Genuine pain. Well, that would mean I would have to be human, mrs. Winslow. And we both know better, right?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: Jeffrey, wait.", "Sam: Cassie?", "Cassie: Huh?", "Sam: You haven't seen livvy around have you? I just went by the house and she and emma, they're not there.", "Cassie: No. Maybe she ran an errand or something.", "Sam: No, no, I was suppose to watch emma so liv could come here for the meeting. But if she's not here and she's not at home...", "Cassie: Oh, no.", "Sam: What?", "Cassie: I gave her an ultimatum.", "Sam: Oh, cassie. Liv doesn't like those.", "Cassie: Yeah, I know.", "Sam: What happened?", "Cassie: I told her that she had to tell phillip about emma or I would.", "Sam: What did she say?", "Cassie: She didn't say anything. She just looked at me and she walked away. Oh, man.", "Sam: Well, she couldn't have skipped town. All of emma's things are still at the house. The stroller, the diapers, you name it. The works. So if she's not...", "Cassie: So if she's not out of town that mean that she'S... oh my. We got to go.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: Look, I know how much your children mean to you, okay. That addendum to your will was drafted entirely for our daughter's sake.", "Phillip: You've done a lot for our daughter's sake.", "Olivia: Well, I guess that's what parenting all about, isn't it? I just wanted to make sure emma got everything that she was entitled to. I mean heaven forbid something should happen to you.", "Phillip: What's going to happen to me?", "Olivia: Nothing's going to happen to you. All I'm saying is there's no telling how the rest of the spauldings will treat emma. You know how ruthless your family can be. Phillip.", "Phillip: What have I missed, little girl? I missed your first smile, your first laugh. How many things that I can't get back?", "Olivia: You know, there are a lot of other firsts she's going to have. You can be there for those. I didn't bring her here to upset you, okay? I just thought that you gave her life, you know, maybe she could give you some hope.", "Phillip: Hope.", "Olivia: Hope. So you can get the hell out of this place. Look, why don't you think about this? One day soon, you and emma and I, we could walk out of this place together as a family. We can give her a family, phillip. All the mistakes that we've made. All the crazy things that have happened. Maybe we could do just one sane thing for her and give her a family.", "Phillip: Emma. Emma. That means whole.", "Olivia: We've all been through so much. And there are so many choices that I regret. But she makes it all worth it.", "Phillip: Yes, she does.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: No, thanks. That's all I need. No, really. Thank you. Hey, dad, can I give you a hand?", "Buzz: Where have I heard that before?", "Harley: Right over there about five minutes ago. Sorry for giving you a hard time.", "Buzz: Sorry if I snapped at you.", "Harley: I just worry about you.", "Buzz: You don't have to; I'm fine.", "Harley: Yeah, yeah, yeah.", "Buzz: You don't believe me?", "Harley: It's the same thing that you've been saying ever since you started acting this way.", "Buzz: What way?", "Harley: Dad, you have not been yourself, lately. And you know my imagination works, I start thinking the worse. Like maybe that you have incurable disease. Remember I thought that?", "Buzz: Yeah, when you tried to bring a fleet of doctors in to...", "Harley: Well, who could blame me. Look at the things you were saying. One way ticket, no refund. You can't come with me. By the way, the folks at olympic travel say they still have a copy of that ticket athens on file in case you wanted to use it on a future date. That's what you're trying to tell me wasn't it that night over there? But something had you so scared that you were willing to run off and leave us again. See, dad, I'm betting that the same thing that made you want to run off is the same thing that took you to the fairgrounds the other night. Somebody may be stalking josh lewis, but they're definitely chasing after the rest of you.", "Buzz: Okay, you got me, copper. I'd stick 'em both up, but you know I got this thing...", "Harley: Oh, dad.", "Buzz: Ow! Oh, with the arm.", "Harley: I'm sorry. What am I going to do with you? Really. I mean, I came down here to pump you for all this information.", "Buzz: I knew it. I knew it.", "Harley: I knew you knew it.", "Buzz: You know, you can take the girl out of the force, but you can't take the force out of the girl.", "Harley: Yeah, I guess that's true.", "Buzz: Okay. Go. Ask me anything you want. I can't promise any answers, but I can't stop you from asking, apparently.", "Harley: How about if I just stop myself?", "Buzz: Why?", "Harley: Because on my mental list of all the things that are fabulous about me...", "Buzz: You have a list?", "Harley: ...Being a great daughter is way above being a great cop. And I have to admit I feel a little guilty picking on a guy with one arm.", "Buzz: A little? Maybe I should get the sli back.", "Harley: Dad?", "Buzz: Yeah?", "Harley: Whatever kind of trouble you're in, even when it was so bad that it made you want to leave us, you didn'T. You stayed.", "Buzz: It's not that I didn'T. It's that I couldn'T.", "Harley: Same difference. You stayed.", "Buzz: Honey, maybe I should have left, because everyone would have been better off.", "Harley: Don't talk like that.", "Buzz: Honey, you don't know. You don't know.", "Harley: You know what I know? Let me tell you what I know. My father is a great guy. Because the other night when his friends were in trouble, he didn't run. He stayed to help them. He took a bullet for them. And that's loyalty.", "Buzz: No, that's slow reflexes.", "Harley: (Laughs) okay, so that's your story and sticking with it, huh?", "Buzz: Yeah.", "Harley: Okay.", "Buzz: Really?", "Harley: Really. Because I'm not going to push and push and push and risk pushing you away. I'm not going to lose you again. You hear that?", "Harley: So there is something to share? So you're saying there's more to this than just a simple case of self-defense, and our father's involved, and you're not telling me?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Darci: Thank you. Hey, there, chief.", "Frank: Oh, hey, baby.", "Darci: How are you?", "Frank: I'm all right.", "Darci: Oh, this feels good.", "Frank: Yes, it does.", "Darci: Oh, you look like a man who could use a friend.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: \"The gun landed near me, and I scooped it up. Carrie came at me. I told her to drop the gun. She didn'T. I fired. But my first shot missed and hit that mirror there. She was ready to shoot, but i fired again. That time I hit her, and she went down.\" Well, he said it was self-defense, right? And marah, good men will do whatever they have to do to protect themselves and especially to protect the ones they love. Can you hang on to this till i get back?", "Hotel clerk: Of course. What about your dinner order?", "Jeffrey: Um... eat it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie (whispering): She did it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: Listen, it's late. We really have to get going.", "Phillip: I want to hold her just a little bit longer.", "Olivia: The night nurse is going to be coming around soon. I really don't want her to see emma. Please, phillip. Until she's safe, no one can know about her. I promise you I will bring her back again soon.", "Phillip: How soon?", "Olivia: Very soon.", "Phillip: Good night, emma. I love you so much.", "Olivia: We'll see you again soon, okay? It's okay, sweetheart.", "Phillip: Olivia. I'll never forget this.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sam: Hey. You see our faces? This is called relief.", "Olivia: Yeah, sammy. Could you take her?", "Sam: Of course. Of course.", "Olivia: All right, baby.", "Sam: I'll be at the diner down the block.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: Okay, okay. All right, go.", "Cassie: So how did it go? How did phillip react?", "Olivia: You mean before or after he insisted that she might not be his? ( Laughs)", "Cassie: Oh, no.", "Olivia: No, it's all right. Because once he held her in his arms, he knew. You were right, you know. I think that she's just what he needed. If you could have seen the look on his face...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Phillip: You've given me new purpose, olivia. How will I ever repay you? your chili, extra spicy, please.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: I thought i recognized that voice, and then I heard the word \"please\" and, whoo! You must be in a pretty darn good mood today.", "Jeffrey: A bad one, actually.", "Harley: Really.", "Jeffrey: Yeah.", "Harley: Well, you know, the beacon makes a mean bowl of chili, guaranteed to lift your spirits.", "Jeffrey: You're kicking me out?", "Harley: No.", "Jeffrey: Well, then get me the chili.", "Harley: You know, I'm okay with taking orders from you when I'm working for you, but this is a whole other deal I have to get used to. What are you doing here anyway?", "Jeffrey: I'm looking for food. What are you doing here?", "Harley: Moonlighting. Your turn.", "Jeffrey: I like the place. Must be the ambience.", "Harley: See, jeffrey, I just picture you as the kind of guy who, after a long day, goes back to his hotel room alone, gazes at his legal briefs, the \"do not disturb\" sign dangling from the doorknob. For you to venture out into the human race... I don't know. I just feel like there's got to be some sort of agenda.", "Jeffrey: Hey, cooper, this human race you're talking about...", "Harley: Mm-hmm?", "Jeffrey: Did it ever occur to you just maybe, maybe I might be a part of it? Not just some prosecuting machine?", "Harley: No.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Buzz: O'neill, I've answered all the questions I'm going to answer. If you want a statement, you can go back to the police house.", "Jeffrey: Take it easy, buzz. I'm here for the chili.", "Buzz: Oh, really? The beacon makes a mean bowl of chili, you know.", "Jeffrey: Yeah, yeah, I do know.", "Buzz: Why are you here?", "Jeffrey: Well, maybe I just want to have a conversation.", "Buzz: What's your angle?", "Jeffrey: No angle.", "Buzz: If you were to have an angle... Jeffrey:$Okay, if there were an angle, I'd say it might have something to do with the statements that you and your buddies gave me down at the police station.", "Buzz: What about them?", "Jeffrey: They're false, buzz. They're bogus.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Pick up. Pick up, pick up, pick up. Okay, gus aitoro, your fiancee is now officially worried. Call me back.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Frank: Wow. This is so good. How did you know?", "Darci: Oh, I just knew. Tiny voice inside of me said, \"frank needs a tuna sandwich, and he needs it now.\"", "Frank: (Laughs) good for you.", "Darci: Oh, honey. I'm so sorry you've had such a tough day.", "Frank: Look, I don't mind a tough day; it's part of the job. But what I hate is being on the outs with my sister.", "Darci: Yeah.", "Frank: You should have seen the way she looked when she walked out of here. And everything going on with my dad... I'm sorry, darci, I just can't talk about this stuff right now.", "Darci: Frank, that's no problem. In fact, let's not talk at all. Let's just... let's go home.", "Frank: Oh, honey, I can't go home. I'll be back soon though, all right?", "Darci: Walk me out? Get some fresh air?", "Frank: Absolutely. Thanks for doing all of this.", "Darci: Honey, you're always taking care of everyone else, protecting your father, your sister, marina, me. You've got to let me take care of you every once in a while, okay? Just so long as you come home.", "Frank: Thank you for giving me a reason to come home.", "Darci: I love you.", "Frank: I love you too, baby. I'll walk you out. After you.", "Darci: Thank you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: You did the right thing. I know that emma is your first priority, but for phillip, you did the right thing.", "Olivia: I hope so, cassie. Because he certainly wasn't all the eager to protect us when i was pregnant with her.", "Cassie: I know, olivia.", "Olivia: Oh, come on, it's true. For whatever reason, phillip was unwilling or unable to put our wellbeing over lizzie'S. And I know what you're going to say: Lizzie is his daughter. But...", "Cassie: She is.", "Olivia: So is emma. And emma almost didn't make it into this world because of lizzie.", "Cassie: Do you blame phillip for that?", "Olivia: Yes. I did, for a long time. Then I came back and I realized that, after seeing him, that he was just as much a victim as i was, you know? But I got off easy. You know, alan only tried to buy me off. What did they do to him?", "Cassie: What did they do to him?", "Olivia: They're the reason he's in there. I mean, yeah, my leaving may have pushed him over the edge, but this has been years in the making, cassie. And who do they leave to pick up the pieces, but me? And you know something? That's okay, because phillip and emma and I, we're not going to be victims anymore. We're going to be the new spauldings. And I am picking up those pieces, cassie. Just you watch.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Phillip: She loves me. She loves me not. She told me my baby died. She let me take the blame. She ripped my heart out of my chest, and then she let me suffer, when she could have ended it. Well, I'm going to end it, olivia. Enjoy our daughter while you can, because I'm going to take her away from you the way you tried to take her away from me. Your father's coming for you, emma.", "[NEXT_ON]", "Harley: I don't understand what you're talking about.
