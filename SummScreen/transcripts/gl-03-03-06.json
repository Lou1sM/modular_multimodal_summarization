        "Reva: Did I mention how much I hate this?",
        "Josh: Did I mention how much I don't really care? Welcome to the Beacon! You'll be staying here until you get better. 24-hour service, no stairs, and or course, me to wait on you hand and foot.",
        "Reva: It's not like we haven't been through this a thousand times before, you thinking you need to take care of me when I'm perfectly capable of taking care of myself.",
        "Josh: Okay, okay. Don't abuse the privilege, please. Come on, sit down.",
        "Reva: I'm fine.",
        "Josh: Just let me help you, Reva.",
        "Reva: I'm fine! Okay.",
        "Josh: Okay. Easy. Are you okay?",
        "Reva: Yeah. It's just all of the time I spent in that hospital bed.",
        "Josh: Why don't we turn around and go back to Cedars...",
        "Reva: No. Please, no more hospitals.",

        "Billy: I caused the accident, Frank. I'd been drinking. I got behind the wheel that night; I had been drinking. I'm the one that's responsible. I guess you better just take me in.",

        "Billy: Yeah, don't I wish?",
        "Frank: Billy, I need to talk to you, buddy. I just got the paperwork from the D.A. It says here that you're representing yourself at your own hearing? That's pretty stupid.",
        "Billy: Yeah, well, thanks for the input.",
        "Frank: Billy, I'm not talking to you as a chief of police; I'm saying it to you as a long-time friend. You need a lawyer and you need a good one.",
        "Billy: Guilty people don't need lawyers, Frank; they just need somebody to apologize to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Hey, did you get my message?",
        "Coop: Yeah. A message about milk, right? It's in here.",

        "Coop: Wow.",
        "Ava: What, is something wrong?",
        "Coop: No, there's nothing wrong. You look good; you look great. So what... I mean, what's this attire? You trying to earn more tips here or what?",
        "Ava: Yeah, so all it takes is a little hair and makeup and a new outfit, and... you should have told me sooner.",
        "Coop: Okay. All right.",
        "Ava: Yeah, you should have. Do you know where the coasters are?",
        "Coop: Yeah, actually, Dad moved them; they're right over here. Let me grab them. You smell good.",
        "Ava: I don't smell like pickles and hamburgers, as usual?",
        "Coop: No, no, you don't smell like pickles and hamburgers. So what's the occasion?",

        "Coop: Oh, okay.",
        "Lizzie: Good for you. Get out there and go for it. Brian, hey, it's Lizzie Spaulding. How is Springfield's hunkiest escort? Great. Listen, about your date with Ava this evening, big bonus if you can keep her busy all night.",

        "Jeffrey: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: Thanks. I didn't know you were going to be here.",
        "Jeffrey: How could you? We hardly ever talk to each other anymore. We're like two strangers living under the same roof.",

        "Jonathan: Just something for you... us.",

        "Ava: Why not?",
        "Jonathan: No questions. Get outside now! I need your help with something. And wipe that stupid look off your face. She's going to know that you're talking to me.",

        "Tammy: That was the plan. But he had to go somewhere all of a sudden.",
        "Lizzie: Not that far. He's outside on the porch with Ava.",

        "Tammy: I don't have to trust her; I trust Jonathan.",

        "Tammy: Yes, it's working out.",
        "Lizzie: You seem happy. It's just... I mean, isn't it tough? Practically your whole family is against you guys.",
        "Tammy: Well, your family was against you and Coop, and that didn't stop you. Look how happy you guys are.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. Oh, Jonathan just left. And here's little Mary Sunshine, looking very guilty. I think they were plotting something.",
        "Tammy: Would you stop? She works for him.",
        "Lizzie: She works for Coop, too. It's a good cover. Did she or did she not hide that she was married to Sandy?",
        "Tammy: I think you're making a big deal out of nothing. Jonathan just...",
        "Lizzie: See, you are on to her, too.",
        "Tammy: No, no, no. This has nothing to do with Ava. When Jonathan said good- bye to me just now, I got the feeing that he's up to something. It seemed like he needed to prove something to me.",
        "Lizzie: Jonathan on a mission? Talk about scary.",

        "Cassie: Well, then, I'm glad I can give you back your edge. You know, I still love you, Jeffrey. And I want to work this out.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, it can't stay like this forever, you know.",

        "Cassie: We're fine.",
        "Jonathan: What are you doing tonight? Do you have any plans?",
        "Cassie: Why?",
        "Jonathan: Well, I wanted to invite you to something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Well, what did he say?",
        "Tammy: I can't remember exactly. It was something about \"it doesn't matter if we spend this afternoon together because we'll be spending lots of days together in the future.\"",

        "Billy: Look, Frank, all I want to do is just get this over with, okay? I mean, do my time, pay my fine, community service, whatever it is the judge says I have to do.",
        "Frank: Yeah, but a DWI comes with stiff penalties. And, besides, you have a record, and someone was hurt.",
        "Billy: Someone, yeah.",
        "Frank: I think it's a hell of a thing you're doing, coming forward and taking responsibility for your actions, Billy.",
        "Billy: Well, I almost killed Reva. I think it's time for me to be responsible.",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, it still takes guts. Oh, good news: She's out of the hospital.",
        "Billy: Reva went home?",
        "Frank: Actually Josh took her to the Beacon with him. You know, who knows? Maybe this will bring them back together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Anything else I can do for you, ma'am?",
        "Reva: Gee, I don't know. I'd like to, but my doctor told me I shouldn't exert myself. ( Laughter )",
        "Josh: So nice to know some things never change.",
        "Reva: For the record, I know that the reason you're doing all of this is out of some sense of obligation.",
        "Josh: You need to stop thinking now, rest.",
        "Reva: Fine, but I want to call Billy. I want to check on him. Can you hand me the phone?",
        "Josh: No, no, don't do that. Just call him later.",
        "Reva: I just want to make sure he's okay. I wasn't the only one who was in the accident.",
        "Josh: Yeah, Reva, I'm very much aware of that.",
        "Reva: Did you tell him I'm here? Because if he calls the house and there is no answer, he is going to worry.",
        "Josh: Reva, just don't worry about Billy now. Just, please, try to rest.",
        "Reva: With the accident, it is the kind of thing that might tempt him to start drinking again. And he's been working so hard to stay sober, and I don't want him to take a slide backward.",
        "Josh: Look, I'm telling you, just let it go, all right? You are not his wife.",
        "Reva: Did he say anything to you?",
        "Josh: About?",
        "Reva: Me, him? What we were talking about before the accident?",
        "Josh: About the fact he thinks he might be having some feelings for you?",
        "Reva: Thinks?",
        "Josh: I don't think that is any of my business.",
        "Reva: No, I guess it's not. So, I'll just... if you could just get the phone?",
        "Josh: No.",
        "Reva: Fine, I'll get it myself.",
        "Josh: No, you won't, Reva.",
        "Reva: Joshua!",
        "Josh: Okay, he can't be reached right now?",
        "Reva: Why?",
        "Josh: Because he's in jail!",
        "Reva: What?",
        "Josh: He's in jail; he's waiting for his arraignment, Reva. He's the reason that this happened to you, the reason you got hurt.",
        "Reva: No. No, that's not true. It was an accident, Joshua. It was just an accident. There's got to be someone that can help us out here.",
        "Josh: No, there's nothing you can do, Reva, and it was not just an accident, okay? Before Billy got behind the wheel of that car, he had been drinking. He was drunk.",
        "Reva: Billy was drunk when... no, that can't be, because he'd never put my life in danger like that.",
        "Josh: Reva, when I got to the scene of the accident, I pulled you out of the car and then I found a fifth of bourbon on the floor of the car. It was pretty much empty.",
        "Reva: No, there's got to be some sort of a mistake.",
        "Josh: It's not a mistake. I confronted Billy later on and he admitted to it.",
        "Reva: No!",
        "Josh: He was drunk.",
        "Reva: No. If he was drunk, I would have known. Oh, my God, Billy. Are you drinking again?",
        "Billy: ( Yells out )",
        "Reva: Oh, my God, I remember. There was a bottle; it was on his seat in the car. --At his feet in the car. And I saw it and everything went black.",
        "Josh: I wanted to let him tell you himself.",
        "Reva: But if the police found the bottle, why didn't they arrest him right away?",
        "Josh: Because the police didn't find the bottle. I did before they got there, and I hid it.",
        "Reva: You protected him. But how did the cops know he was drunk? Did they test his blood at the site?",
        "Josh: He told them.",
        "Reva: He confessed? Why?",
        "Josh: Actually, I think you know the answer to that.",
        "Billy: Reva, I can make you happy. I'm telling you, after all we've been through...",
        "Reva: Oh, Billy.",
        "Billy: No, look. Nobody understands you better than me. You understand me better than anybody else. And with me, it is unconditional.",
        "Reva: I know that, I do. You have to go down there. You have to go to the jail; you have to get him out. You have to make this better, Joshua. I mean, he can't be there. He shouldn't be alone. I know he made a slip, but... and I'm sure he regrets it, but you've got to do something.",
        "Josh: Have you not heard a word I've said, Reva? He almost got you killed.",
        "Reva: But I wasn't. I wasn't hurt.",
        "Josh: You stopped breathing! If I had not come...",
        "Reva: Okay, I know, but there was no harm done, okay?",
        "Josh: Okay, I can't just walk into that police station and tell Frank he's got to let Billy go.",
        "Reva: Yes. You can post his bail. You have to bring him back here, you have to. You're his brother; you have to do this, please.",
        "Josh: Reva, Billy's doing what he feels is right. And for the first time in a long time I agree with him.",
        "Reva: No. Billy can't feel like he has to pay for this or that he has to learn a lesson from this. Please. Please go down there and get him out. You have to. He'd do it for you.",
        "Josh: No, he'd do it for you.",
        "Reva: Just go.",
        "Josh: Okay, all right, Reva, but I'm not going to tell him what to do. He's going to have to figure that out by himself.",

        "Jeffrey: No, I'm done.",
        "Jonathan: Good.",

        "Jonathan: Lighten up. It's a good thing. It's for Tammy. She'd like it. She's going to like it. She'd want you to be there; it would make her happy, which is what I care about. Fine, forget it. For the record, I tried. You know what? I'll try again when I get more information about tonight. Show up, support us or just support your daughter. Your choice.",
        "Jeffrey: What was that about?",
        "Cassie: I have no idea, but I think I'd better go check on Tammy.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, okay. I've got to get back to work. So rain check?",

        "Tammy: Okay.",
        "Ava: Okay. Do you prefer strapless or not strapless?",
        "Tammy: What's this for again?",
        "Ava: A survey. Your idea of the most romantic vacation: Country inn or tropical resort?",

        "Tammy: Oh, he's so romantic, but not usually the flower type. But I guess this is why he took off the way he did, to order these.",
        "Lizzie: Wait a minute. What did he say to you right before he left? He said something about you guys spending a long time together. And then he was talking to Ava, and now she's asking about your dress size and where you want to go away to? Oh, my gosh! Tammy, that's it.",

        "Jeffrey: Billy wants to represent himself at his hearing? Come on, Josh. You've got to be kidding me. You've got to get him a lawyer.",
        "Josh: Yeah, yeah, first things first, Jeffrey. I want to post bail on my brother. I want him out of that jail cell right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Oh! Whoever it is, just chill! Hey!",
        "Jonathan: Knock, knock. Time for your sponge bath.",
        "Reva: How did you do that? That door was locked.",
        "Jonathan: I have my ways. You don't want to know about them. Here. Just call me thoughtful.",
        "Reva: So what floral arrangement in this hotel did you swipe this one from?",
        "Jonathan: The one on this floor. So how's the old noggin?",
        "Reva: It's not old, and it's fine when it's not spinning.",
        "Jonathan: Perhaps a drink would help.",
        "Reva: You're certainly in a festive mood. Whose feelings did you hurt today? ( Laughs )",
        "Jonathan: I'm just happy to see my mom up out of that bed.",
        "Reva: Uh-huh. What's the real reason?",
        "Jonathan: I'm feeling good about me and Tammy, even though Cassie still hates me, even though Sandy's a ticking time bomb. It's different good, you know. I told Tammy something yesterday, something that I did-- but nothing bad, nothing real bad.",
        "Reva: You sure know how to reassure a girl.",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) I thought she was going to freak out about it, and she was totally cool about it.",
        "Reva: Well, because she loves you.",
        "Jonathan: It's not just that, ma. She has always loved me, but I used to feel like she wanted me to fit into a mold, but now she just accepts me for who I am.",
        "Reva: You can't beat that.",
        "Jonathan: No. I used to wake up every morning feeling that I was going to wreck this, the best thing that ever happened to me and then I was going to regret it for the rest of my life.",
        "Reva: I know the feeling.",
        "Jonathan: But I don't feel like that anymore. I feel...",
        "Reva: ( Laughs )",
        "Jonathan: I can't believe I'm going to say this. I feel happy.",
        "Reva: I don't believe you. That's good. I'm glad. I'm glad for you, I am. At least one of us is getting it right. Oh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Okay, stop doing this to me, because there's no wedding.",
        "Lizzie: I am so impressed with Jonathan. He really goes after what he wants. He didn't waste any time with the proposal or the planning that usually has to... he is going to surprise you with an actual wedding. I mean, that explains the dress and then pumping you for where you want to go on your honeymoon.",
        "Tammy: No, I don't think he would do it. I mean, it takes so much to set up, and on such short notice.",
        "Lizzie: I know. You'd want your family there, and they probably wouldn't show up, especially not your mom.",
        "Cassie: Tammy?",
        "Tammy: Hi, Mom.",
        "Cassie: Jeffrey and I just had the strangest conversation with Jonathan. Do you have any idea what he would be inviting us to tonight?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Look, Frank, Billy feels bad about the fact that Reva was hurt.",
        "Frank: Well, you know what? He should because he was driving drunk.",
        "Josh: Are you sure about that? Because if I recall correctly, nobody bothered to test him at the crash site.",
        "Frank: Oh, come on, Josh.",
        "Jeffrey: Billy confessed. He told us, Josh.",
        "Josh: I know that, Jeffrey. He told me, too, but I'm not so sure that he remembers exactly what happened. Now in the meantime, I would like to post bail on my brother, if you don't mind.",
        "Frank: I know he's your brother, but I've known him for a very long time, and I honestly believe that he's telling me the truth.",
        "Josh: Well, yeah, but, Frank, the judge is going to want a whole lot more than that, don't you think? Am I right about this, Jeffrey, or not? Do you have a breathalyzer test somewhere that I don't know about, that will prove Billy is telling the truth? Do you have a... what do they call it, a tox screen?",
        "Frank: I don't need it. He gave me a confession.",
        "Josh: Yeah, but, Frank, think about it. What's going to happen when Billy wakes up out of this guilty haze that he's in? He's going to recant, don't you think? When he starts to realize that he's going to spend some real jail time, he'll recant-- and that's exactly what he should do-- and then what are they going to have to prosecute him with? Nothing. Whose fault is that going to be?",
        "Jeffrey: You seem awfully sure that Billy wasn't drunk that night, Josh.",
        "Josh: I was there, Jeffrey. As far as I'm concerned, he was sober, and I would be willing to testify about that in court if that's what I have to do.",
        "Frank: Billy! You're going home, my friend.",
        "Billy: I'm what?",
        "Frank: Your brother's posting your bail.",
        "Billy: What's going on here?",
        "Frank: Well, it looks like you're going to be sleeping in your own bed tonight.",
        "Billy: What are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Ooh, honey, I'm happy for you, I am. I mean, a lot of people want what you and Tammy have, and some people get it, but then they screw it up.",
        "Jonathan: You think that's what I'm going to do?",
        "Reva: I didn't say that.",
        "Jonathan: No, you didn't have to.",
        "Reva: Hey, come here. Listen to me. I'm glad that Tammy accepts you for who you are. I am, but that doesn't mean that you should stop trying to be a better person, stop trying to be happy.",
        "Jonathan: I love it when you play mom.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs )",
        "Jonathan: So... how are things with you and Josh, girl? He was by your bed 24/7 at the hospital. Now you're here under his tender loving care. It's good right. Huh? ( Laughs )",
        "Reva: I don't know.",
        "Jonathan: Well, let me phrase it another way. If I was to invite you to something, would I invite you as a couple or just you?",
        "Reva: Invite us to what?",
        "Jonathan: Just something tonight.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) Something, what?",
        "Jonathan: It's a surprise. It's a celebration.",
        "Reva: A celebration of what?",
        "Jonathan: Just show up, and you'll find out. ( Laughter )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I will be right over here if you need me.",
        "Cassie: Okay, what's going on? Jonathan's acting all strange; now I'm getting a weird feeling from you. Well, those are beautiful.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan sent me these. See? That's exactly what I'm talking about, about how much Jonathan's trying, you know, how much he loves me.",
        "Cassie: Honey, you know, buying a girl flowers is easy. Being the guy that deserves that girl, now, that's a different story.",
        "Tammy: You see how happy he makes me. You must.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I see it. I just... I wonder how long it will last.",
        "Tammy: Maybe forever. And what if that were to be the case? I mean, what if Jonathan and I were together forever? You would have to accept him eventually, right? You wouldn't just turn your back on me. What if we had kids?",
        "Cassie: Kids? God. Why are you asking me this?",
        "Tammy: Because I want to know.",
        "Cassie: Okay, but why? Why right now? What's going on?",
        "Tammy: Nothing.",
        "Cassie: Honey, are you trying to tell me something?",
        "Tammy: Sort of, yeah.",
        "Cassie: God, honey, you're not...? Oh... okay, well, you know, if you're in trouble, we'll... we'll figure something out. We'll go over the options and we'll...",
        "Tammy: Wait. You think I'm pregnant?",
        "Cassie: You're not?",
        "Tammy: I can't even believe you would jump to that conclusion.",
        "Cassie: Oh, God! Can you blame me? You're living together, and you're acting crazy...",
        "Tammy: Mom, Jonathan and I haven't even made love yet-- not since when he first came to town.",
        "Cassie: You haven't?",
        "Tammy: No, and that is all I'm going to say on the subject. I can't even believe we're having this conversation.",
        "Cassie: Oh! I'm sorry. I'm really proud of you. Well, but if that's not what you were gearing up to tell me, then what is it?",
        "Tammy: It's about Jonathan's invitation. Will you come, Mom? Will you come to my wedding?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: You come down here to bust my chops and now you're going to be the big hero?",
        "Josh: Reva asked me to get you out of this mess, and that's what I'm doing, Billy.",
        "Billy: She knows I was drinking, and she's not mad?",
        "Josh: Yeah, go figure.",
        "Billy: She's just feeling sorry for me; that's all, Josh.",
        "Josh: She feels something for you; that's for sure, Billy. She loves you. Now, I don't know if it's in the way you want her to, and that's not my business. What is my business is this: You get out of this mess and you hurt her again, you'll wish you never got out of this jail cell.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: What's going on? Talk to Mommy.",
        "Jonathan: Okay, how about this?",
        "Reva: Hey.",
        "Jonathan: You come with me right now. You help me make the arrangements.",
        "Reva: For?",
        "Jonathan: The surprise.",
        "Reva: Oh! You love driving me crazy. You do. Okay, we'll have it your way. We'll do it your way. I'll come with you because then I can find out what it's for. ( Laughter ) Oh, maybe not. Ooh. Ooh...",
        "Jonathan: Are you okay?",
        "Reva: Yeah.",
        "Jonathan: You want me to get the doctor?",
        "Reva: No, no, no, no, no. But I think I'll stay here. I'd love to come with you but I'm going to stay and rest so that I'm ready for the big event, whatever it is. Okay?",
        "Jonathan: Okay, I'll give you a hint. It's for Tammy.",
        "Reva: ( Gasps ) Tammy! What a shock!",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. I want to show her and show everyone, prove to them, how much she means to me.",
        "Reva: You don't have to prove that to anyone. It's written all over your face. Now go on. Get out of here. Jonathan, you keep smiling like that, your face is going to freeze that way. ( Laughs )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Your wedding?",
        "Tammy: Jonathan's going to propose to me tonight, and I'm going to say yes.",
        "Cassie: No, no, honey. You're not. You've got to think this through.",
        "Tammy: There's nothing to think about. I love him.",
        "Cassie: You think you love him, but, baby, but you're so young, and marriage is a huge commitment.",
        "Tammy: Funny. You didn't say that to me when I told you that I was going to marry Sandy.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I did.",
        "Tammy: But when I assured you I was ready and I knew what I was doing, you were happy for me. Be happy for me now.",
        "Cassie: Well, baby, that's a perfect example, because Sandy was wrong for you then, and Jonathan is wrong for you now. Don't you remember what he did to you and how devastated you were?",
        "Tammy: If I could get past that then why can't you? I mean, really, Mom. If I can let it go, why can't you let it go?",
        "Cassie: Because I love you. And I don't want you to see you full of all that pain again.",
        "Tammy: Well, now. You see me now, full of joy and feeling more love than I've ever felt in my whole life, and loving Jonathan back.",
        "Cassie: Baby, sometimes love is not enough.",
        "Tammy: What else is there?",
        "Cassie: Sweetie, do you have any idea that you deserve so much more than Jonathan can ever give you?",
        "Tammy: Okay, look, Mom, we keep having the same conversation and it keeps coming back to the same place, so accept Jonathan or don't; that's your choice. But I really hope that you do accept him, because if I have to choose between you and Jonathan, I'll choose my husband. I will.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Vanessa: Boy, I hope you're not buying that.",
        "Dinah: Buying what?",
        "Vanessa: Alan-Michael. He's a wolf in sheep's clothing if I ever saw one.",
        "Jonathan: If tonight goes the way it's supposed to go, then it's going to change everything.",
        "Harley: I'm starting to need you, and it scares me to death."
