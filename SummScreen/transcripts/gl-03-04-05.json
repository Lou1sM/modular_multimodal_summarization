        "Edmund: And we will, cassie. We will soon. Just not today. Is it terribly selfish of me to want to keep you all to myself? At least now. We're starting out on this amazing, amazing experience together.",

        "Harley: \"Dear gus, there isn't any good way to do this, and now there isn't much time. I'm on my way to the courthouse to finalize the plea deal with the judge. O'neill says they won't sentence me today. I guess that happens in a separate hearing. But we know it's coming. Ten years. A lifetime. I don't want you to put your life on hold for ten years or ten months. I know you're going to want to stick close and help my kids through this, but don'T. Don't do it. It's time for you to start over. Make a new life for yourself. That's what I want you to do.\"",

        "Jonathan: I'm really proud of you, mom.",
        "Reva: Give me the papers.",
        "Jonathan: I gave you the ammo to get this deed done. Now, how soon until the da throws the book at edmund?",
        "Reva: I don't even know if I'm going to press charges against him, okay? I was going to use the papers to get him to take me to cassie. But now I just need to think.",
        "Jonathan: Don't think. Use those instincts of yours. Come on.",
        "Reva: I need to think about what's best for cassie.",
        "Jonathan: What's best for cassie is to have edmund locked up before she has a baby with that psychopath.",
        "Reva: I don't want to talk about this with you. Give me the papers. I have to get to the court.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. If you want to play russian roulette with your sister's life.",

        "Dinah: No.",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Dinah: No, no. See, it was about cassie. About protecting the princess is what last night was about.",
        "Bill: See, that's not true. That was not the point...",
        "Dinah: Do you know how sick and twisted I am? I'd just like to explain it to you. I have played princess cassie for so long that I actually started to believe I was her. That everything she had should be mine. And at the same time, I hated her for taking everything, everything that should be mine in my dream. So being her and hating her is what my life has become. That's who I am. And I didn't see that until last night. And I am nothing without cassie.",
        "Bill: Stop it. Listen to me. Listen to me. That's the whiskey talking. That is not you.",
        "Dinah: No. It is.",
        "Bill: Yes, it is.",
        "Dinah: Bill, I saw it in your eyes and I saw it in daddy's eyes when you guys did not care, you were very excited to pack me off to italy, so you could keep me away from cassie and she could go on with her life.",
        "Bill: You know what? This is what it's all about. It's you getting a fresh start. That's what you need. That's all you need, dinah.",
        "Dinah: She has everything that I have ever wanted, and i have needed that to stay alive.",
        "Bill: Listen, I have to go. But I'll drop you off somewhere on my way to the courthouse.",
        "Dinah: Bill, I'm not going with you.",
        "Bill: Dinah, come on. What are you going to do? Sit here?",
        "Dinah: Bill, I want you, please... to forget that I'm your sister, and I'm going to do my damnedest to forget you all. I mean it.",
        "Bill: I have to go to the court, all right? But I'm going to call you later. Okay?",
        "Dinah: To family.",
        "Edmund: Anything I can get for you while I'm downstairs checking on the phone?",
        "Cassie: Well, how about breakfast? I'm starving.",
        "Edmund: Your wish is my command. ( Phone rings )",
        "Cassie: I didn't know you had your cell phone on you.",
        "Edmund: Well, it's in case the clinic needs to reach us.",
        "Cassie: I could have called reva.",
        "Edmund: Yes, hello? I asked not to be disturbed. Oh, right, is he? Oh, good, good. Right, thank you. Tell him I'll be there. Appreciate it.",
        "Cassie: What's up?",
        "Edmund: A meeting with a japanese diplomat down in the hotel restaurant.",
        "Cassie: Well, so much for breakfast, huh?",
        "Edmund: No, it won't take long at all. I'll have the restaurant send something up for you to eat.",
        "Cassie: And you could leave your cell phone so I can call reva.",
        "Edmund: Well, I wish I could, but I have to use this to get back in touch with the consulate. Don't worry, I'll have the hotel phones up and running in no time, okay? Go back to bed and let me take care of everything else. I love you.",
        "Cassie: ( Sighs )",
        "Coop: Is that mommy right there in the middle?",
        "Zach: Yep.",
        "Coop: Yeah.",
        "Zach: And me and jude have our arms around her.",

        "Cop: Chief cooper, sorry to interrupt.",
        "Frank: Okay, earl, this is not a good time.",
        "Cop: Sorry. There's a situation down on fifth street. I think you should be there.",
        "Frank: Okay, I'm going to the court. So you're going to have to handle it.",
        "Cop: This won't take long. It's very important.",
        "Frank: It better be. All right, I'll meet you outside. You guys, listen, something just come up. So I'm going to have to meet you at the courthouse, all right? I'm sorry.",
        "Coop: All right.",
        "Buzz: We'd better be going.",
        "Coop: Dad, come on. This is all wrong. This shouldn't even be happening right now.",
        "Buzz: It's the way she wants it.",
        "Marina: I hate this. I feel like she's just giving up.",
        "Buzz: Damn it! She wants to protect the rest of us. Let's not make it harder than it is for her, okay?",
        "Marina: Okay. Okay, of course.",
        "Coop: Dad, I'm sorry. I mean, I didn't mean to...",
        "Gus: Oh, so this is nice. This is like a \"dear john\" letter. You're going to kiss me off with a letter?",
        "Harley: I couldn't figure out any other way to do this.",
        "Gus: You make the decision without me, you don't even consult me, and this is what you want to do?",
        "Harley: Well, you said you weren't going to be in court today. So...",
        "Gus: Yeah, I'm not going to court. I'm not going to stand there and watch you throw your life away.",
        "Harley: That's fine, but I'm still going through with this. Ten years. Ten. I mean, even with time off with good behavior, that's a really long time. So my life will be in the state pen and yours will be here. That's the reality.",
        "Gus: I don't really have a reality without you in my life, okay? So if they send you to vailsburg, I'll just buy the house next door to prison.",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Gus: If they send you out of state, I'll just... I'll hit the road. I'll be the first one in, the last one out every single visiting day. You can count on it.",
        "Harley: That is not...",
        "Gus: In fact, I'll get a job. I'll get a job...",
        "Harley: ...A life for you. You deserve more than that, gus.",
        "Gus: I'm not walking out of your life.",
        "Harley: Well, you have to! Okay? You have to. Because I can't live with anything else. None of this is the way it's supposed to be, okay? None of this is the way I wanted it. Starting with phillip. But he's dead, okay? And now we are, too. And I've got to go.",
        "Gus: Wait a second. Just wait a second.",
        "Harley: You know what? I don't want to be late for court. And this is the part you said you couldn't watch. So don'T.",
        "Edmund: William? William?",
        "Maitre d': Yes?",

        "Maitre d': No, mr. Winslow. No one by that name.",
        "Edmund: Hmm. He must be making other calls. All right, I'll wait, but I'd like to order some breakfast and send it up to my wife in suite 3120.",
        "Maitre d': There you go.",
        "Edmund: Thank you very much.",
        "Jonathan: 3120, huh?",
        "Cop #1: We caught this guy red-handed. B & E. He would have cleaned the place out.",
        "Frank: All right. Well, good for you. Why bring me in? Just take him downtown and book him.",
        "Cop #2: He wants to make a deal. Says he knows something.",
        "Frank: Look, smith, I know you're new on the force here, but you know the routine. You book him, you take his statement, then you talk deals later.",
        "Webster: Hey, chief.",
        "Frank: Excuse me. Did you read him his rights?",
        "Cop #2: Yes, sir.",
        "Webster: You don't want to play this one by the book.",
        "Frank: Just take him downtown. I'm due in court.",
        "Webster: Your old man's buzz cooper, right?",
        "Frank: What's it to you?",
        "Webster: He owns that restaurant where that guy got whacked.",
        "Frank: So?",
        "Webster: What if I told you i was there the night of the shooting and that I saw things?",
        "Reva: Jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, hi, reva.",
        "Reva: Hey.",
        "Jeffrey: Did you get those papers I sent you?",
        "Reva: Yes, I got them. I haven't had a chance to look at them yet or decide what I'm going to do about them.",
        "Jeffrey: Please, take your time before you file them, because once you do, it could change a lot of lives.",
        "Reva: It could also keep cassie from being hurt by edmund. Neither one of us wants that, right?",
        "Jeffrey: I'll see you inside.",
        "Gus: Hi.",
        "Harley: I thought you weren't coming.",
        "Gus: Let's just see this thing through.",
        "Bailiff: All rise. Court is now in session. The honorable judge joan ellis presiding.",

        "Judge ellis: In the matter of the unlawful death of phillip spaulding, the charge being manslaughter in the first degree, how do you plead? oprah: Soap star shemar moore and",
        "Reva: Well, you know, maybe we should get a private investigator. Because I'm scared to death about cassie and what edmund might do to her. All right, all right. I won't do anything until we talk. I'll call you after the hearing's over.",
        "Bill: What's up? Everything okay?",
        "Reva: It will be.",
        "Bill: I think they started. We'd better get in there.",
        "Jeffrey: I have the state's copy of the plea agreement right here, your honor.",

        "Harley: No, it was my decision.",
        "Judge ellis: Everything appears to be in order. We're ready to proceed. Ms. Cooper, are you prepared to finalize this plea today? Ms. Cooper, do you understand my question?",
        "Harley: Yes. Your honor, is it possible to hold this hearing privately? I mean, not in the courtroom?",
        "Judge ellis: Is there a problem?",
        "Harley: No. I'm ready to proceed.",
        "Judge ellis: Harley cooper, you have been accused of the murder of mr. Phillip spaulding. The legal document you presented to the court today states that you wish to change your plea from \"not guilty\" to \"guilty.\" Are you now prepared to do that?",
        "Edmund: This is ridiculous. I'm not going to wait any longer.",
        "Dinah: Princess cassie. Say it.",

        "Edmund: Look, dinah, I've been where you are, wanting to live someone else's life, willing to do just about anything to have it. It's no good. It doesn't work. My obsession for my brother richard cost me everything i cared about. I hate to see you make the same mistake.",
        "Dinah: My whole life's been a mistake, eddie.",
        "Edmund: It's not a mistake, dinah. Take it from someone who's been there. Your life hasn't even begun yet. ( Telephone rings )",

Mr. Winslow completely shut down the phones? No. Uh-uh, that's wrong.
