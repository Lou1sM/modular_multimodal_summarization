        "Vanessa visits with Dinah and tells her she is proud of how her daughter had turned her life around. They find Alan-Michael in her office and Vanessa warns her that he is a wolf in sheep's clothing. Vanessa hears about how Dinah pushed Mallet and Harley to work together and warns her that may have been a mistake. When Dinah gets upset, Vanessa just says she is an overprotective mother. Harley and Mallet get a call from the Foxwood Lodge saying that a note from Gus has been found. They go to check it out and Harley says that although the handwriting is shaky it is Gus's. Harley reads the note, which says goodbye to Harley and Mallet comforts her. Alan-Michael tips Dinah off to where Mallet and Harley are and when she calls, the owner says that they are \"behind closed doors\". Sandy calls Jeffrey and tells him he is leaving town. Jeffrey sees his suitcase and later gets a phone call that Sandy boarded a plane. He and Cassie start to make love but she pulls away remembering the time in San Cristobel. Thinking that Jonathan is going to propose, Tammy tells Cassie that if she has to chose between the two of them she will pick her husband, Jonathan. Cassie tells her that she is in for a life of everyone pointing and staring and Marina steps in and asks Tammy if this is what she really wants. Once Tammy says she wants to marry Jonathan, Marina steps in and tells her to call her if she needs a bridesmaid, and pulls Cassie away. Tammy goes to the fish shack where she finds candles, a wedding dress, and a note to tear up her invitation to her wedding with Sandy. She complies and when she hears someone she tells Jonathan that everything is perfect, only it's not Jonathan, it is Sandy dressed in a tux with a bouquet of flowers. Jonathan shows up at the hotel where he has set up his surprise and is surprised that Tammy isn't there."

        "Cassie: Honey, you deserve so much more than Jonathan could ever give you.",
        "Tammy: Look, Mom, we keep having the same conversation and it always comes back to the same place, so... accept Jonathan or don't. That is your choice. But I do hope that you will accept him, Mom, because if I have to choose between you and Jonathan, I'll choose my husband. I will. I don't want to have to choose, I really don't, Mom, but...",
        "Cassie: But you would. You would choice to marry him even if it meant losing me?",
        "Tammy: It doesn't have to be like this, if you would just be happy for me.",
        "Cassie: Honey, from the day you were born, I have fought to give you a better life than I had. Every lousy job, every humiliating thing I did because I want you to be happy.",
        "Tammy: I am happy. Happier than ever. And even you can't take that away from me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Now what, boss? Now that I've already missed my date.",
        "Jonathan: I need you to deliver this to Tammy for me.",
        "Ava: Ooh, what is this?",
        "Jonathan: It's a note that tells her where to meet me later.",
        "Ava: And where would that be?",
        "Jonathan: No. ( Laughter ) You know enough already.",
        "Ava: You're so secretive about this. It must be a really big deal.",
        "Jonathan: Well, let me put it to you like this... if tonight goes the way it's supposed to go, then it's going to change everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Hey. I got your message. Look, if you want to contest the restraining order...",
        "Sandy: Does it look like I'm contesting the restraining order? Look, I just wanted you to know that I was leaving Springfield.",
        "Jeffrey: Just like that?",
        "Sandy: You make it sound like it was an easy decision. It wasn't, but it's the right thing to do.",
        "Jeffrey: Well excuse me for being a little skeptical, but what gave you this sudden epiphany?",
        "Sandy: Tammy's gone. Nothing I can do to save her now. She's with Jonathan and I need my own life, free of the two of them, so... good-bye, Jeffrey, and thanks for everything, including the restraining order.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: Dinah. Dinah, Dinah. What would you do if you knew Harley was sleeping with your boyfriend?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Mom, thank you so much. You don't mind taking a look at the projections for me?",
        "Vanessa: Oh, no. Not a bit, although from what you said on the phone, you have a really good handle on it already.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, well I talk a good game.",
        "Vanessa: Dinah, you do a lot more than that. This is all in your blood. Thanks to Grandpa Henry. ( Laughter )",
        "Dinah: I do, I feel like I'm, you know, making him proud.",
        "Vanessa: You are, darling, you are. And you're making me so proud, the way you've turned your life around. It's wonderful.",
        "Dinah: Well, thank you. Well, it's because of your support and the amazing friend I have had in Harley. It's unbelievable.",
        "Vanessa: And the love of a good man.",
        "Dinah: ( Clears throat )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Why do you do that? Why do you leave the door open so anybody can walk in?",
        "Mallet: It's my little gift to the housekeeping staff.",
        "Harley: Well, get over yourself. I've been waiting downstairs for like 15 minutes.",
        "Mallet: Oh, sorry.",
        "Harley: I have a cell phone; you could've called.",
        "Mallet: Why? You're usually the one who's late.",
        "Harley: Regardless. You know, we made a huge mistake here.",
        "Mallet: Oh, boy. I know. I don't even... I don't even want to go over it again.",
        "Harley: No, I'm not talking about that; I'm talking about this. Us being partners. It's not working. I'm ending it now.",
        "Mallet: Why?",
        "Harley: Because. Because, because... because I'm starting to need you and it scares me to death. I don't mean I need you, okay? What I was saying was that I need the job. You know, it's a lifeline for me and it could become an obsession.",
        "Mallet: Well, wasn't that the point?",
        "Harley: No. I mean sort of. I mean it's unhealthy. This whole thing, all of it is just unhealthy.",
        "Mallet: I think it was your idea to be my partner, wasn't it?",
        "Harley: Yeah, but you hated it in the beginning.",
        "Mallet: Well, yeah, I had my reservations, sure.",
        "Harley: You said it was a disaster waiting to happen?",
        "Mallet: Oh, wow, did I say that? That's kind of harsh. I'm sorry.",
        "Harley: No, I'm sorry. And see, I'm letting you off the hook. So I'll talk to Frank this afternoon?",
        "Mallet: No, don't bother.",
        "Harley: You'll talk to Frank?",
        "Mallet: No, neither one of us is going to talk to Frank because I'm fine with the way things are.",
        "Harley: Oh, this is all working for you, is it?",
        "Mallet: Well, it's working for you. You just can't see it, yet. So just relax and, you know what? Just chill out.",
        "Harley: Don't tell me to chill... you are not listening to me.",
        "Mallet: I'm listening.",
        "Harley: And I hate it when you tell me how I feel.",
        "Mallet: Well I hate it when you get overemotional and you don't think things through, okay. We are a good team together.",
        "Harley: I didn't say that we didn't work well together. I'm saying this doesn't work well-- this-- this gets weird sometimes!",
        "Mallet: Well, so what? I mean I'm still kind of the glue that holds you together nowadays.",
        "Harley: Not good. Modesty was never one of your strong points.",
        "Mallet: Listen, we've set boundaries, okay? We set our limits. What happened, you know, is not going to happen again. We're not going to have any more slip- ups, okay? So if being my partner at the moment is good for you...",
        "Harley: It's not.",
        "Mallet: You know, you were upset when you found Gus' dry-cleaning receipt. You were upset on Gus' birthday. That's understandable. And I was there both times and I think you hate me for that. I think you hate when you need someone. No, actually, more than that, I think you hate to admit that you need someone. And I think that's the problem, really. I think that's really the issue here. And you think getting rid of me as your partner is going to make all of that go away and you're wrong. I'm here to tell you that you're wrong. That's what is going on. So get that out of your head. Because I'm not going anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Hello. Is seat-warming a part of your duties nowadays?",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm good at it, ask anybody. Vanessa, it's good to see you.",
        "Vanessa: It's very good to see you, Alan-Michael. I was so sorry to hear about you and Lucy, that it didn't work out.",
        "Alan-Michael: Oh, thanks. So what do you think of your daughter? She really has made quite a name for herself here at Spaulding. Did you ever think she would be following in your footsteps? ( Laughter )",
        "Vanessa: Well, I don't know, but I do know that I am very, very proud of her and she's going to be extraordinary.",
        "Alan-Michael: That's what I keep telling her.",
        "Dinah: Okay. All right. Enough sucking up. Did I get any messages?",
        "Alan-Michael: I don't know, but there's a report on your desk. Teddy Farkas needs your signature.",
        "Dinah: Teddy Farkas?",
        "Alan-Michael: Oh, he's the new president of Mrs. Sullivan's cookies. Harley gave him the green light a couple of weeks ago.",
        "Dinah: Oh, okay. Very good. I'll take a look at it. Thanks.",
        "Alan-Michael: If you have any questions, just give me a buzz.",
        "Dinah: Will do.",
        "Alan-Michael: And nice to see you, Vanessa.",
        "Vanessa: Yes.",
        "Alan-Michael: How long are you in town for?",
        "Vanessa: Oh, just a day or two.",
        "Alan-Michael: Well, enjoy. Make sure she doesn't work too hard. ( Laughs ) You two should go out on the town tonight. She does have an expense account here, you know.",
        "Vanessa: ( Laughs ) ( sighs ) Boy, I hope you're not buying that.",
        "Dinah: Buying what?",
        "Vanessa: Alan-Michael. He's a wolf in sheep's clothing if I ever saw one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: Right, let's see what we can do to start this fire.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Could you do me one last favor? Could you tell Tammy all I ever wanted was for her to be happy, and that I wish her the best.",
        "Jeffrey: Hey. Good luck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Do you think that people know what a softie you are?",
        "Jonathan: Just give that note to Tammy, okay?",
        "Ava: You know, if you shared a little bit of that softer side with other people besides Tammy, maybe we wouldn't think you were the devil incarnate.",
        "Jonathan: People?",
        "Ava: People like, ooh, Tammy's mom.",
        "Jonathan: I'm trying here.",
        "Ava: I know. I know you're trying and it's romantic and it's cute...",
        "Jonathan: Okay, that's enough.",
        "Ava: Fine, all right. Your secret is safe with me. You're a tough guy, you're a bad boy, blah, blah, blah. But I do have to say one thing: You give a girl hope.",
        "Jonathan: Me?",
        "Ava: Yeah, you. As a loser in love to a reformed loser in love, you hung in there. You fought and you won.",
        "Jonathan: It's nothing special. Okay. ( Laughter ) Tammy was worth it. Get out of here. Get out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Do you seriously think I don't want you to be happy?",
        "Tammy: I'm starting to think so, yeah.",
        "Cassie: Well, you're wrong, honey. You couldn't be more wrong.",
        "Tammy: Fine, prove it. Come to my wedding and support me and Jonathan.",
        "Cassie: How? Honey, you are jumping into this wedding like you're going to the movies. You're been dating two months and you're talking about marriage?",
        "Tammy: I'm talking about the man that I want to spend the rest of my life with.",
        "Cassie: I'm sorry, it's crazy. You don't know him, not well enough.",
        "Tammy: You don't know him.",
        "Cassie: What are you looking at? If you marry Jonathan, this is going to be your life.",
        "Tammy: In this town? Are you kidding me?",
        "Cassie: You can joke about it all you want. But the staring and the whispering, it won't stop. You're going to have to get used to it.",
        "Tammy: People can whisper and stare all they want to. I'm going to live my life how I want.",
        "Cassie: Well, good luck.",
        "Tammy: Why do you care so much about other people think?",
        "Cassie: Because I have been where you are right now. Honey, I have been the butt of people's jokes. Hell, I was on the cover of the \"National Inquisiter.\" Do you think it's fun? How about you wait six months and then tell me how you feel about it? Because it's not fun. It's not easy and it's painful. And I will do whatever it takes to keep you from that pain.",
        "Tammy: You just want to keep me from Jonathan.",
        "Cassie: You're not even listening to me. I just want you to stop and think about what you're doing.",
        "Tammy: When I was getting ready to marry Sandy, all I did was think-- that was the problem. What I should have been doing was feeling. You know, maybe if I had, things wouldn't be so screwed up now.",
        "Cassie: I cannot let it happen.",
        "Tammy: I'm getting married, Mom. There's nothing you can do to stop me.",
        "Marina: Really? I'm not so sure about that.",
        "Tammy: What is this, Marina?",
        "Marina: You and Jonathan are getting married?",
        "Tammy: I think he's throwing a surprise party tonight. --A surprise wedding tonight.",
        "Marina: Wow. And this is what you want?",
        "Cassie: Marina, you know this is wrong, don't you?",
        "Tammy: Marina, I did not expect this from you. What are you going to do, handcuff me to my mom so I can't go?",
        "Marina: You know, I might if I thought it would bring you two back together.",
        "Cassie: I just want to stop her from making the biggest mistake of her life.",
        "Marina: Tammy, isn't this just a little fast?",
        "Tammy: No. No. I love him, and I can't imagine life without him. And, yes, I know it will always be tough and messy, but I'm okay with that. That's what makes it mean so much.",
        "Cassie: This would be a good chance for you to be a really good friend, Marina.",
        "Tammy: What, by locking me up?",
        "Cassie: We just... she's caught up in the moment. We just have to stop for one night.",
        "Tammy: I'm leaving. Are you going to stop me?",
        "Marina: I think this would be a good time for me to step in. Let's have a talk. Tammy, good luck. Call me if you need a bridesmaid.",
        "Tammy: Thank you.",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Tammy: Be happy for me.",
        "Cassie: Tammy.",
        "Marina: Cassie.",
        "Cassie: You have got to be kidding. Tammy!",
        "Marina: Just talk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Oh, hey, Kirby.",
        "Kirby: I'm glad I found you, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: Me?",
        "Kirby: Special delivery from Jonathan.",
        "Tammy: Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: You're not going to an execution. You're going to get the best girl and the world, so just tie the tie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Now, Mom, do you think he's after my job? I don't think so. Alan- Michael doesn't even want to be here.",
        "Vanessa: Then why is he here?",
        "Dinah: To help out Harley, just like I am.",
        "Vanessa: Oh, come on. Don't be naive. Now, you're thinking about the boy who parachuted into the fourth of July celebration, but he is all grown up and he is all Spaulding.",
        "Dinah: Mom, look, I know that you are looking out for me.",
        "Vanessa: That's right. And don't you dismiss me so quickly.",
        "Dinah: I'm not dismissing you. I'm just saying I'm not going to be paranoid; I'm not going to live in fear, all right? You, of all people, should know where that leads.",
        "Vanessa: Sweetheart, you're not going to go back to that place. You're not. Don't be frightened of it. Anyway, how are things going with you and Mallet?",
        "Dinah: Very well. I don't want to jinx it by gushing.",
        "Vanessa: Come on, a little gushing never hurt anybody.",
        "Dinah: It's weird.",
        "Vanessa: What? I want some details-- g-rated. G-rated details.",
        "Dinah: Mom. Okay, look, we're fine, okay? He accepts me for who I am and he still wants me.",
        "Vanessa: Of course he does. That's what it's all about.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, so you've been telling me all these years.",
        "Vanessa: Do you believe me now?",
        "Dinah: Maybe, but I don't want to blow it. I don't want to blow any of it.",
        "Vanessa: You're not going to. You just keep a level head on your shoulders and you'll be fine.",
        "Dinah: Okay. I even encouraged him to partner back up with Harley.",
        "Vanessa: You did what?",
        "Dinah: You heard me. I figured if he could believe in me, the least I could do was believe in him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Well, I don't know which is worse, me needing you, or you needing to be needed by me.",
        "Mallet: This is so not about me.",
        "Harley: Oh, please. Yeah, you don't want to lose me as your partner.",
        "Mallet: No, not really, I don't. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Mallet: Hmmm. Mallet.",
        "Alan-Michael: Mallet, Alan-Michael Spaulding. I got your number out of Dinah's address book.",
        "Mallet: Well, Alan-Michael rummaging through my girlfriend's purse. How's it going?",
        "Alan-Michael: Yeah, I just got a call from the manager of the bed and breakfast down by Clayton...",
        "Mallet: Yeah, okay.",
        "Alan-Michael: Yeah, he told me one of his guests found a letter by the shore.",
        "Mallet: What kind of letter?",
        "Alan-Michael: A letter from Gus. I have a feeling the guy smelled Spaulding and called me looking for some kind of payday. I have no idea if it's real or not.",
        "Mallet: Okay. What did you tell him?",
        "Alan-Michael: I told him I'd get back to him. But I thought you might want to look into it. And I figured you'd want to tell Harley.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, absolutely. She's right here.",
        "Alan-Michael: Good. It's Foxwood Lodge out on Route 15.",
        "Mallet: Foxwood Lodge, Route 15. Okay, got it. Thank you, Alan-Michael. Thanks.",
        "Alan-Michael: Let me know if I can do anything. You know what to do.",
        "Harley: A note from Gus.",
        "Mallet: Yeah.",
        "Harley: What does it say?",
        "Mallet: I don't know.",
        "Harley: When was it written? I don't understand.",
        "Mallet: I don't know. We'll go and find out. And when we do, I'm going to be there for you, okay? Let's go find out. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, do you see Sandy Foster on the flight? You're positive? Okay, great. Yeah. I owe you one. You got it. Next time I'm in D.C. Okay, got to go. Bye. Cassie?",
        "Cassie: I've lost my little girl, Jeffrey. I've lost her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Jonathan, I got your note!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth Chamberlain, \"Inside The Light.\" I realized that I wasn't just on a tv show, I was actually part of a family tradition, and that really made me feel special. To the fans, thank you. Thank you for letting me come into your home and be a part of your family. See Beth Wednesday, March 8th, \"Inside The Light.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: They're getting married.",
        "Jeffrey: Tammy told you that?",
        "Cassie: She guessed it. Jonathan is sending her all kinds of hints, I guess you'd call them...",
        "Jeffrey: Hints?",
        "Cassie: You heard him earlier. He says this thing tonight is all about their future together. And what else can it be?",
        "Jeffrey: I don't know. Maybe he's buying her a house.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, so he can burn it down again.",
        "Jeffrey: But the point is, darling, we're not going to know anything until we get there.",
        "Cassie: I know. And it's my worst nightmare ever. There has got to be a way to stop this before it is too late.",
        "Jeffrey: Did you ever think that, you know, that maybe... maybe Tammy and Jonathan might have a chance to make it?",
        "Cassie: I can't even believe you would even say that.",
        "Jeffrey: You know, Sandy is leaving town. He told me so himself, and I checked it out. His flight leaves at 7:30.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, so what does that have to do with Tammy and Jonathan?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, maybe with Sandy out of the picture, Jonathan won't have to worry about looking over his shoulder all the time and he can, you know, concentrate on what's good for Tammy.",
        "Cassie: Well, I don't want him to concentrate on Tammy! And maybe Sandy has given up, but I sure as hell haven't. I'm never going to accept that...",
        "Jeffrey: Accept what? Accept what, huh? Accept that love can't change someone?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: It's beautiful. It's perfect. Oh, how did you know? Do you love me with the lights on you when the lights are on let the world see let our love be shown and if everyone is watching us let them watch...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I thought we were talking about Jonathan.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, we are, and we aren't. I can't help but believe that some of this rage and frustration isn't directed at me.",
        "Cassie: You know what? Jeffrey, let's not do this right now.",
        "Jeffrey: No, no, no. Let's do it right now, okay? Because I can't take it. We cannot stay in this limbo. Okay? We're together, we're not together, pretending...",
        "Cassie: You don't want to do this.",
        "Jeffrey: I do want to do it. Listen, I'm a big boy. So just... just tell me, okay? Whatever it is, just please tell me. Tell me what you're feeling, okay? Don't hold back.",
        "Cassie: You want me to tell what I'm feeling?",
        "Jeffrey: Yes. Yes, please.",
        "Cassie: What I'm feeling is I want to be safe! My God, Jeffrey, for once in my life I want to feel safe, and I want my daughter to be safe. That's all that matters. Because I'll tell you one thing, love doesn't matter. Love doesn't last and it's all a bunch of lies.",
        "Jeffrey: You don't believe that.",
        "Cassie: I do.",
        "Jeffrey: You don't believe that, and I can prove it to you. Let the world see let our love be shown and if everyone is watching us let them watch let them talk just believe what we need is what we are...",

        "Vanessa: Darling, I commend you for your grownup attitude.",

        "Vanessa: Well, it's just that A.C. was married to Harley.",
        "Dinah: Okay, Mom, you're sounding an awful lot like Blake right now.",
        "Vanessa: Well, I meant that it's natural that they would have feelings for each other, and if they're spending a lot of time together, I...",
        "Dinah: Okay, you're not... ( laughs ) You're not doing a lot for my big grownup new attitude or my paranoia.",
        "Vanessa: Well, I just... I don't know, I just want you to be aware. That's all.",
        "Dinah: I will. I will.",
        "Vanessa: Good. Um... I guess... I guess I owe you an apology. I do. I um... I want to give you 100% support and you deserve it, and I don't want to raise any doubts.",
        "Dinah: Accepted. You're just being my overprotective mommy.",
        "Vanessa: ( Laughs ) Oh, I am because I love you.",
        "Dinah: I love you, too.",
        "Alan-Michael: Sorry.",
        "Vanessa: Oh, don't be. I've got to leave, and... you have a lot of wonderful work to do.",
        "Dinah: Yes. Bye, Mom.",
        "Vanessa: Bye-bye.",
        "Alan-Michael: Sorry to interrupt.",
        "Dinah: It's all right. Your report, I have to go ahead and sign it, don't I?",
        "Alan-Michael: Oh, don't worry. I was wondering, have you heard from Mallet recently?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: You're saying one of your guests found it?",
        "Man: Down by the dock.",

        "Man: Yes, I called Spaulding Enterprises when I saw the name.",
        "Mallet: Harley, is this Gus' handwriting?",
        "Harley: It's shaky, but it's his.",
        "Mallet: He must have written it after the crash.",
        "Harley: And stuck it in that plastic bag at some point.",
        "Mallet: It's okay. It's going to be okay. I'm here. Do you think we could get a few minutes here, please? Thank you.",
        "Harley: I've been hoping and praying for one last word from him, and now that I have it, it terrifies me to read it. (Cell phone rings ) You should get that. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Mallet: You... you need to read that. Gus wrote it for you. Do you want me to read it to you?",
        "Harley: No. \"My Harley, my wife, I'm sorry. It doesn't look like I'm going to make it back to you. But I am okay. I want you to be. Don't stop your life for me. I want you to find love again. Be happy. I love you forever. Gus.\" My God, it's so final.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Why are you asking about Mallet?",
        "Alan-Michael: Oh, I got a call earlier, a lead on Gus maybe, so I called Mallet with it, and he said he would check it out. I'm just wondering if you heard anything?",
        "Dinah: Nothing. Does Harley know about this?",
        "Alan-Michael: I don't know. I left it up to Mallet to decide whether or not to tell her.",
        "Dinah: What is the lead?",
        "Alan-Michael: Oh, a note a guest at an inn down at the lake found.",
        "Dinah: An inn?",
        "Alan-Michael: Yeah. Foxwood Lodge, I think that's it. This looks great. Well, if you don't need anything else?",

        "Cassie: I want to, Jeffrey. I tried. I'm trying. But I... I can't forget that you took Richard's place, and I can't pretend that it doesn't matter to me because it does.",

        "Marina: Yeah.",
        "Alan-Michael: Wow. You really did want to see me.",

        "Alan-Michael: Passion, huh?",
        "Marina: Yeah. Why? Does that sound silly?",
        "Alan-Michael: Works for me.",
        "Marina: Good. Because I think it is pretty incredible to have someone in your life who would give anything in the world to be with you.",
        "Alan-Michael: Yeah.",

        "Mallet: Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Everybody needs a little love, you know? There's no getting around that one. I think what Gus meant was that you've got a long life in front of you. You have. You've got a lot of love to give. And I don't think Gus would want you to settle for less, okay? And I don't want you to settle for less.",
