{"Episode Summary": [], "Recap": ["There is a new witness in Phillip's murder case. His name is Jack Webster, and on the night of Phillip's murder, he was robbing the electronics store next door. He told the police that he saw Ruth leave Company distraught. He then looked into the window and saw a very alive Phillip drinking a beer after Ruth's departure. Harley tells Gus that she may still take the plea deal in order to protect Zack. Gus makes a deal with her allowing him to have two days to research the new witness. If all of the information is true, then Harley must give up the plea deal. Cassie reads the papers outlining the charges against Edmund and goes to Jeffrey to ask if they are true. Jeffrey won't answer. He tells her to ask Edmund. Cassie gathers that it is probably true, but hopes that it was an accident. Dinah and Jonathan are overjoyed at their \"accomplishment.\" Reva sees Jonathan and Dinah kissing and is disgusted. Reva is upset that the papers fell into Cassie's hands, and she blames Jonathan. Reva had no intention of sending them to Cassie. Cassie finally returns to the hotel suite and finds Edmund waiting for her. He wants to take her to the clinic for the second phase of in vitro. Cassie hesitates and is contemplating what to do. Coop and Lizzie are both scolded by their family members for entering into a relationship together."], "Recap Author": "Elizabeth", "Show Title": "Guiding Light", "Transcript": ["Frank: Your honor, I have new evidence in this case.

Problem, ma'am?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: No. I had some papers from the D.A.'S office and they seem to have disappeared. I can help you look for them.", "Reva: No, it's okay. I have a feeling I know where they are. Okay. Well, have a nice day.", "Reva: Thanks. You, too.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dinah: Ow! ( Phone ringing )", "Jonathan: Not now, mom.", "Dinah: No, I think you should answer that.", "Jonathan: No, reva possibly figured out I took the legal papers from her and now she's ticked. ( Dinah laughs ) oh, well, too late to put that genie back in the bottle. Now all we have to do is wait for aunt cassie to get that special package and watch her blow her marriage to uncle eddie sky-high. ( Laughs )", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Cassie? Where is she? Cassie? Mr. Ambassador? I got word you wanted to see me.", "Edmund: Mr. Me channel, i left strict instructions that my wife was not to be disturbed. Where is she? I don't know, sir we feel honored your instructions, the phone in this suite was locked and no one can exit the elevator on this floor without a key.", "Edmund: Then where is she? She didn't walk out of here on her own. But she did, mr. Winslow. The doorman saw her exit the hotel a little while ago.", "Edmund: You let her out! Do you have any idea what you've done?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: I got it. I got it. \"Edmund winslow assaulted mr. O'neill in the winslow barn, which imperiled the lives of cassie winslow and her minor son roger joshua.\" What? No way. No way. Edmund would...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jonathan: Whoa. Cassie, where's the fire?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: Your honor, you cannot let her change her mind. She said she was guilty. A deal is a deal.", "Gus: What's he talking about?", "Judge: Sit down. Mr. Spaulding, or I'll have you cited for contempt.", "Gus: My client's reason for taking a plea deal in the first place are personal. But if chief cooper can produce a witness that would clear my client's name, well I think justice is the most important thing. We're in a court of law.", "Jeffrey: Justice is what we're after here, which is why the state finds chief cooper's timing suspiciously convenient.", "Frank: You know, o'neill, i took an oath to uphold the law, just like you did.", "Judge: That's enough. I agree the sudden appearance of this witness is questionable but we are here to pursue the truth. Bring this witness into chambers chief cooper. We'll adjourn and reconvene until tomorrow. Until then, miss cooper's signed statement remains on the table.", "Alan: O'neill, this is obviously another cheap trick by gus and you know it.", "Jeffrey: Yeah, probably. But what if it's not, alan? You want to put away the right person for killing your son, don't you? Or don't you care anymore?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: How can this be happening?", "Gus: I don't know. You tell me. You're the one that said you remember shooting phillip.", "Harley: I did. I thought I did.", "Gus: What's this all about, frank?", "Coop: The story is frank here is a hero.", "Frank: The witness's name is jack webster, we caught him breaking and entering and it's his third offense and he's taking serious time.", "Harley: Do we trust him?", "Coop: Who cares? The point is, we'll get you off.", "Harley: The point is I care. This guy stunt step forward until now.", "Frank: He would be confessing to yet another crime.", "Gus: The night phillip was shot.", "Frank: Look, the guy was stealing from an electronics store next to company. He sees ruth karloff leaving company. She looked disheveled, disoriented, and when she left he looked in the company window and saw philip polishing off a beer.", "Harley: He saw philip alive after I left?", "Alan: Oh, this is a credible witness. You're going to accept the testimony of a thief, right?", "Frank: We searched the guy's apartment. We found stolen goods from the store in his apartment.", "Harley: And the story about the beer, frank?", "Alan: I don't care if phillip had a bottle of chateau lafitte and a four your meal. This witness is a liar.", "Harley: I need some air.", "Gus: Let me, honey. Reporters.", "Alan: Don't worry about the witness said, harley, remember what you said. I expect you to finish what you started.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: No. No comments. Not now.", "Cassie: O'neill?", "Jeffrey: Cassie?", "Cassie: Is it true? Did you swear out a complaint against edmund?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dinah: Oh, there is nothing like seeing a couple fall apart to make you just want to jump into bed and count your orgasms. I mean blessings. Can we please celebrate?", "Jonathan: How do I fit into this? Your heart belongs to uncle eddie.", "Dinah: You fit in quite nicely. Well, you know, edmund... edmund until he is a free man and real we belong together, what's wrong with a little friendly interaction, hmm?", "Reva: Well, I don't know what's worse, that my son's a thief or a fool.", "Dinah: You know, your son here is not a pillar of virtue himself.", "Jonathan: I'm not?", "Reva: You couldn't just mess around with anybody, huh? You had to pick the one person who's made it her life's mission to destroy my sister.", "Jonathan: Reva, you're over- thinking this. She's hot. It's not like we're serious or anything.", "Reva: And, of course, that just makes it all all right, huh?", "Dinah: You know, I would love to sit here and listen to you trash me, but I have a manicure.", "Reva: Having your claws sharpened, dinah?", "Dinah: See you later, honey.", "Jonathan: Can I buy you a drink?", "Reva: You know, just when i think there's a chance that... just tell me you didn't let her see it.", "Jonathan: See what?", "Reva: You know what. The charges against edmund. I know you swiped them from me. Now hand them back.", "Jonathan: I can'T.", "Reva: Give me the papers, jonathan, now.", "Jonathan: That's good that you want them, that's fine, but those papers have already been faxed to the person who needs to see them. Someone who needs to know what uncle eddie's really all about.", "Reva: Oh, my god.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: What is this? Where'd you get these?", "Cassie: Is it true? Did edmund attack you, almost kill you that night in the barn? Did he start the fire that nearly killed me and R.J.?", "Jeffrey: Look, cassie, I'm real busy by right now. Harley was just about to plead guilty to murder, another witness popped up and I have to figure out what's going on. Here.", "Cassie: No, you need to tell me the truth, jeffrey. This accuses my husband of attempted murder. This is a man that I share my life with, that I am hoping to have a child with.", "Jeffrey: Well, then ask him. Ask edmund, not me.", "Cassie: I can'T.", "Jeffrey: Why not?", "Cassie: I just can'T.", "Jeffrey: Because you're afraid? You're afraid that he won't tell you the truth? And you don't trust him.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Obviously I can't trust any of my orders to be followed, but I'll try one more time. Should my wife return, I want you to show her back up to the suite and call me immediately. Yes, sir.", "Edmund: And if her sister reva lewis shows up, don't let her anywhere near my wife. Yes, sir.", "Edmund: Thank you. Excuse me.", "Dinah: Hello. What? No hello? Is something wrong with cassie?", "Edmund: No, why would you think that?", "Dinah: Well, I know there can be complications after a surgery that she went through. You were so on cloud nine this morning and now you seem so grim.", "Edmund: No, we're just moving on to the next step of the in vitro produce and we're anxious, that's all.", "Dinah: Corey explained that to me. There's a narrow window of time the embryos are viable, right?", "Edmund: Yes, very narrow so i have to go, if you'll excuse me...", "Dinah: Is she in the car or what? Are you going to go with her or without her?", "Edmund: Is it possible we can play 20 questions later on? I'm in a bit of a rush right now, excuse me.", "Dinah: That's not a problem. But you know what? I wanted to tell you something. I wanted to tell you something before you go and that is thank you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Coop: Where is my...", "Lizzie: Is that what you were looking for? I am your boss, coop. If you're going to be late at least let me know. What are you doing?", "Coop: A million, a zillion apologies, boss lady. I'll make it up. I'll work this month, this year, I don't even care anymore.", "Lizzie: What's your story?", "Coop: The clouds have parted, the sun is shining down. A witness came forward in defense of harley, which means that my sister is going to be cleared of shooting your dad.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: That's good. Let's get away from the reporters. This is very good. You know what? We can have ourselves a little toast. A little toast because frank says this guy is solid, and that's real good, because that means you, my dear, need a glass. You are inches away from getting acquitted, so you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to put this guy on the witness stand and prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that you didn't kill anybody. You did not kill phillip. What?", "Harley: Ever since the night of the murder I've been in a fog, you know, wondering if i could have done this thing, so sure that it would have been me. And now this guy shows up. Now? I mean, it's like o'neill said, awfully convenient timing. It's a lot to wrap my brain around, okay?", "Gus: You know what's a lot for me to wrap my brain around?", "Harley: What?", "Gus: That you didn't do this. You don't remember doing this. You didn't do a damn thing, did you?", "Harley: Do me a favor: Don't freak out on me now, okay?", "Gus: Right. Because I've had no reasons to freak out. You've got one foot in prison, you're going to leave me, leave the kids, right? And then there's this little statement, this big fat lie. You cried to me. You lied to everybody. Do you realize that? Your brother, your kids, everybody in court, everyone. They have a word for that.", "Harley: Pathological?", "Gus: Try again. How about stupid? The word is stupid. Why would you lie?", "Harley: Because of you. Coming up on \"guiding gh", "Harley: There were threats.", "Gus: What, that thing with disbarring me again?", "Harley: No, not you. Zach. I did it so that my son could have a life. I did it so he wouldn't turn out like his father.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jonathan: So what? You would rather your sister have a kid with this guy?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: When she sees my name on those papers, she'll never forgive me. And edmund will be furious.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: So you're throwing yourself under a bus because of me? That doesn't make any sense, I'm sorry.", "Harley: Okay. Well then shut up for a second and I'll tell you. But first of all, we don't know for sure that I didn't kill phillip, okay? I don't remember what happened that night?", "Gus: This guy, whatever his name is, he's a good witness.", "Harley: Let's talk about webster, okay? Has it occurred to you he could be lying? He's looking at hard time.", "Gus: Any scale that's worth their weight, half their brain is not going to go to a D.A. And talk about somebody who's innocent, they'll talk about somebody who's guilty. So it's not about whether he's lie organize not. Why did you lie? That's what this is about.", "Harley: Okay. The trial wasn't looking so good okay? Alan's testimony and all. And ten years started to sound better than life. Plus, you know, o'neill told me that the deal was not going to stay on the table forever. And alan... um...", "Gus: Yeah, you know what, I'm sorry to interrupt you but can we just talk about alan for a second? What was that in the court? What was this \"a deal is a deal\"? What did he do?", "Harley: There were threats.", "Gus: What, the thing with disbarring me again?", "Harley: No, not you. Zach. I did it so that my son could have a life. I did it so he wouldn't turn out like his father. And I lied to you because I knew you wouldn't let me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: Harley's case has been dropped? She's free?", "Coop: No, actually. Not yet. See, the witness has to testify on her behalf, but that's just a mere formality.", "Lizzie: I don't get it. How? Who?", "Coop: Well, the guy just happened to be in the neighborhood the night your dad was shot and he saw harley leave the place, looked through the window and saw your father was still alive, which means that harley couldn't have killed him.", "Lizzie: Does my grandfather know about this?", "Coop: Um, yeah, actually, he does. He was there when this whole thing came about. He started ranting and raving like a crazed lunatic saying \"there's all these conspiracy theories.\" Right now the judge has the witness in her chambers, and she's questioning him but... do you see what's happening here? Besides harley, do you know what this means for you and me?", "Lizzie: For you and me?", "Coop: Come on, lizzie. I mean, you see what's going on here, we both do. Well, what could be going on here, except the fact that you're a spaulding and I'm a cooper.", "Lizzie: No, I don'T. Why don't you tell me?", "Coop: Why don't you take the rest of the afternoon off with me and I will show you exactly?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: What the hell was that?", "Dinah: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so happy, and I got carried away.", "Edmund: Right. I have to go.", "Dinah: No, no, wait a minute. Come on, don't you want to hear why I'm so happy?", "Edmund: If you can tell me in under 30 seconds, fine.", "Dinah: Okay, okay. Listen, earlier today you found me drowning my sorrows in a glass of whiskey, and you sat next to me and listened to me and you gave me a swift kick in the butt which I apparently needed.", "Edmund: Glad I could help. Bye-bye.", "Dinah: Yes, but you know what you did? You gave me support and you gave me some kindness, and that inspired me to go on and to get my act together and to be the best me I can be.", "Edmund: I really am that great. I've got to go.", "Dinah: Edmund! Yes, you are that great. You are. You are my role model. You finally changed your life and I think doing the same. You know what?", "Edmund: What?", "Dinah: I'm doing it. And it's not just idle chatter. I've really begun.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: Tell me what you did.", "Jonathan: I passed the papers son to cassie so she can no what edmund did.", "Reva: Jonathan.", "Jonathan: Look, it's better she finds out now than goes and has a kid with the guy.", "Reva: You had no right.", "Jonathan: You're the one whose so concerned about cassie having a kid with the guy that you filed charges.", "Reva: That's right. I filed the charges, I had jeffrey draw them up, and it was going to be me who decided how to precede.", "Jonathan: You were dragging your feet because you were protecting your sister. In the meantime she's getting pregnant by a guy who could hurt her 100 times worse. Is that what you want?", "Reva: So you did all this to protect cassie?", "Jonathan: And you.", "Reva: Bull. You did all this for the exact same reason you do everything, to stick it to me and edmund and everyone else who you think has made your life so miserable.", "Jonathan: After all this time we spent together, could you even entertain the possibility that I might be trying to help you?", "Jonathan: By breaking my sister's heart? With a document that has my name on it!", "Jonathan: Reva, I'm doing the right thing. It's what you wanted to do. You just didn't have the guts to go through with it and I did. Maybe that scares you or maybe... maybe you're just plain jealous.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: Jeffrey, please. Tell me the truth. Did edmund do what you're accusing him of? Did he try and kill you?", "Jeffrey: Look, cassie, whatever happened that night, i have put it behind me. I suggest you try to do the same thing. I know you've got these papers...", "Cassie: So it's true. Then it was an accident. I mean, it had to be, right? Because he would never purposely hurt you.", "Jeffrey: Well, like I said, you've got to ask him.", "Cassie: I don't understand. I don't understand. If this is behind you and if you have moved on, then why have you done this? Why have you pressed charges? Why are you dredging this up? Why are you trying to hurt us, jeffrey?", "Jeffrey: I'm not pressing the charges, okay? I didn't file the papers.", "Cassie: Reva.", "Cassie: Reva. If you could forgive edmund, why is she doing this?", "Jeffrey: I didn't say i forgive him. Let's just say I let it go; it's different.", "Cassie: Why is reva involved?", "Jeffrey: Well, because she loves you and she needs to know that you're going to be okay.", "Cassie: Okay. Did, um... did edmund know that reva was going to press charges?", "Jeffrey: I don't think so.", "Cassie: Are you sure? I mean, that would explain...", "Jeffrey: That would explain what?", "Cassie: Why he took me out of town for the I.V.F. Procedure. Why he's been keeping me away from my family ever since. You know, he said it was for me and for the baby so there would be no stress, so reva couldn't bring jonathan around me, but now this makes me wonder, you know?", "Jeffrey: Cassie, don'T. Don't do this, okay? Don't do this to yourself.", "Cassie: How can you stand there and be so calm? The man tried to kill you, jeffrey.", "Jeffrey: Well, something made him change his mind, right? I mean, apparently he's the one that dragged out of their there saved my life, right in? So ultimately he did the right thing.", "Cassie: He slammed a shovel upside your head. He started a fire that nearly killed me and R.J., And he has been lying about it nearly every day. I have no idea what I'm going to do. We're supposed to go to the clinic this afternoon, and they're supposed to implant some embryos. Oh, man.", "Jeffrey: Well, I really should go.", "Cassie: This is what you wanted to tell me before the wedding when you found me in the park.", "Jeffrey: You were... you were dealing with your own demons. And I just wanted, you know, to make sure that you would be happy. That's all I ever really wanted for you is... you know what? I... you've got to put these papers out of your mind and go be with your husband.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: I didn't tell cassie about what edmund did for one simple reason, jonathan: Because I didn't think I had the right.", "Jonathan: Then why did you file the charges in the first place?", "Reva: I didn'T. I didn't even know if I was just going to use them to get edmund's attention to find cassie. I didn't want it like this. I didn't want her to hear like this.", "Jonathan: So what? You would rather your sister have a kid with this guy?", "Reva: When she see misname on those papers, she'll never forgive me. And edmund will be furious. Do I need to remind you what he does when he feels people threaten to take away everything he wants?", "Jonathan: Uh-uh. Edmund's not going to touch you.", "Reva: He might. And he'll hurt you, too, if he finds out you had a hand in this. My decision not to file those papers wasn't just about protecting cassie. Is it too late to get them back?", "Jonathan: Yup.", "Reva: Oh.", "Jonathan: Well, good thing we have each other's backs, huh?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Coop: So, um... how about taking the afternoon off with me and whatever.", "Lizzie: Whatever? I don't think I can do that. I mean, what kind of example would I be setting?", "Coop: Oh, come on! Think of it as an employer striving to keep her employees happy.", "Lizzie: I don't know. I don't know. I mean, my grandfather would be so mad if he found out.", "Coop: Yeah, he would. He would. But he's at the courthouse so he's not coming back. So what do you say?", "Lizzie: Look, coop, I... i really didn't want harley to be convicted, okay? I just honestly thought that she....", "Coop: Yeah, okay, I know, she was guilty. I know that. But she's not.", "Lizzie: So if she's cleared then....", "Coop: Uh-uh. When. When she's cleared.", "Lizzie: Right. What happens then?", "Coop: Well, frank's going to go back to square one and try and he's going try and find the real killer.", "Lizzie: Does that mean our families are going to get along now?", "Coop: Lizzie, when have our families ever gotten along?", "Lizzie: I don't know.", "Coop: But maybe we can set the example, you know. Maybe something like this.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: What the hell are you doing to my granddaughter?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Coop: Uh...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: I heard you and alan in the courtroom that day when he vowed to take zach from my family.", "Gus: So you heard the threats.", "Harley: Yes, I had to do something. I had to stop him. So I lied to you, big. It was the hardest thing I ever did. But I knew you wouldn't let me take plea deal otherwise.", "Gus: So you made a little side deal with alan?", "Harley: Yes. He gave me his word that if i took the deal and I did the time, zach could be raised by my family. I don't want him turning out like phillip and that's exactly what would happen if alan raised him.", "Gus: Do you think when he went to prison he would actually keep his promise?", "Harley: Well, that certainly occurred to me. There's a risk, yeah. But what choice did I have?", "Gus: I don't know. You could have had a little faith in me. I know that's a novel approach for you but...", "Harley: Honey, you could be the best lawyer in the world-- and you are-- but we both know juries are unpredictable. I can't take that chance.", "Gus: It doesn't matter. The conversation is moot because we have a witness who's going to clear your name.", "Harley: I signed the plea deal.", "Gus: So what?", "Harley: So what? So what if webster testifies and the jury doesn't buy it.", "Gus: That's not happening.", "Harley: That could happen.", "Gus: No, it's not.", "Harley: You don't want it to happen, but it could happen. And I don't know if I did this! I'M...", "Gus: Please. I cannot listen to this thing anymore.", "Harley: Well, I might have done it, okay? And my children have to be my first priority. So I'm sorry. But I might still take that plea deal.", "Gus: You have got to be the most pig headed client in the history of legal history! Your own brother has found a witness that can clear your name and you are still, still talking about pleading out?", "Harley: Do you think I want to go to prison?", "Gus: Yeah.", "Harley: No. I don't want to go to prison. I want to spend every day with my children. But listen to me: If I am having trouble buying the fact that I'm innocent, don't you think the jury might have a little trouble with that, too? My son's future is at stake here. I'm not going to gamble with his life. You couldn't possibly understand this, gus.", "Gus: I, do actually. I do understand. But how about this: You made a deal with alan? Can you make a little deal with me?", "Harley: What?", "Gus: Give me two days with this witness, I'll check it out, okay, find out if he's lying. But the he's telling the truth, we take that plea deal off the table. Is that a deal?", "Harley: Okay, deal. I'm scared, okay? Now that there's hope, I have to tell you, I'm a little scared.", "Gus: That's the one thing you can never be afraid of.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Coop: Mr. Spaulding, I...", "Alan: I know what you were trying to do. You were trying to take advantage of my granddaughter. I saw you.", "Frank: I think this lizzie's the manipulator around here, of course only second to you.", "Coop: Frank, don'T.", "Frank: Go sign.", "Coop: Frank, it'S...", "Frank: Go!", "Coop: No!", "Lizzie: I've got a restaurant to run, I can't leave.", "Alan: Let the hired help run it. You are taking the rest of the day off.", "Lizzie: But...", "Frank: I've lost two sons to the cooper and I'm not going to lose my precious granddaughter. You know how your father felt about these people.", "Frank: Have you forgotten what the spauldings have done to this family? Our dad's heart attack, this place, now harley's on trial.", "Coop: Harley's been cleared, okay?", "Frank: Not until the judge says she is.", "Coop: I understand you're try to be the family protector, but you're also coming off the high of saving harley. I don't need to be saved from lizzie. Isn't that right, lizzie? Lizzie, come on, tell them.", "Lizzie: Frank's right, coop, you'd better go inside.", "Coop: What?", "Lizzie: Just get in there before a dock you a whole day's pay, okay, instead of the first three hours that you missed. Granddad, please take me home.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dinah: How harley? Is she all right?", "Jeffrey: Well, she's better off than what she was, that's for sure. Whether it stays that way is another question.", "Dinah: Well, I will look at it as if the glass is half full. What should we toast to, harley?", "Jeffrey: Or something else. You look like the cat who ate the canary.", "Dinah: I did not do anything. But you know what? I know what we're going to toast to. Here is to the happy fact that very soon two people that we care about a lot will be free and clear.", "Jeffrey: You sent those papers to cassie, didn't you?", "Dinah: No, not me. But sometimes good fortune falls on people like us, jeffrey. Besides, look, this is good news for you. Cassie's finally going to be yours.", "Jeffrey: Oh, yeah, and eddie's going to be yours? Is that it? You think he's going to turn to you on the rebound?", "Dinah: I don't judge him the way cassie does.", "Edmund: Well, you don't do anything the way cassie does, sweetie. Cassie is nice, she's smart, she's intelligent, she's got...", "Dinah: ( Groans ) you have it for her so bad it's pathetic.", "Jeffrey: No, you have it for her. You want to cause her misery. You know, with all of edmund's crimes and misdeeds and that's considerable, I really believe that he truly loves her. And he could never love you. Because... well, you're just unlovable.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jonathan: You want a lift home?", "Reva: No! I have to go find cassie.", "Jonathan: Oh, man. Hey, look, why can't you just let it go? Let nature run its course.", "Reva: Like you did? My sister is going to be devastated.", "Jonathan: That's her problem. She's the one ma that married the prince of darkness.Sw6 at least now she can't compound it by having a kid with the guy. Can you see edmund as a father? The kid spits up once and off with his head.", "Reva: Your sensitivity is overwhelming. I only pray I can find cassie and try to undo some of the damage that's been done.", "Jonathan: Mom, stop trying to do the right thing. I already did it for you. Hey, if you're honest, you're glad.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Cassie. There you are. Where did you go? I was so worried about you.", "Cassie: I was going stir crazy, so I just needed to get some air.", "Edmund: Did you catch up with reva?", "Cassie: Reva?", "Edmund: Well, the note. I saw the note.", "Cassie: No. No, I never saw reva. I missed her.", "Edmund: Oh. Well, hey, how about taking a ride with me? I hope you want to because i have a car waiting for us down stairs to take us to the clinic for the transfer. Hello? Mrs. Winslow? There's no time to waste.
