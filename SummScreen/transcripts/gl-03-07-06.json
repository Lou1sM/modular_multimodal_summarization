        "Jeffrey: Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Sorry, I can't.",
        "Jeffrey: Is it Tammy?",
        "Cassie: No.",
        "Jeffrey: Of course not. It's us. You can't forget about that night in San Cristobel.",
        "Cassie: I've tried, Jeffrey. I'm trying. I want to forget that you took Richard's place. I want to pretend it doesn't matter to me, but it does. Sorry, I can't. We should go.",
        "Jeffrey: Then what?",
        "Cassie: I don't know.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that's not good enough.",
        "Cassie: Look, I just...",
        "Jeffrey: I know, you can't pretend and you can't forget, I heard you. But you don't just come out with something so important and just say we should go. Go where, Cassie? If we don't deal with this, there is no place for us to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Look at us. All dressed up.",
        "Tammy: I want you to leave.",
        "Sandy: I showed up for you. I've always shown up for you. Tammy, I'm the one who will always show up for you.",
        "Tammy: Did you hear what I said?",
        "Sandy: I heard you say how beautiful and perfect it was a minute ago. And I'm with you there. And I'm ready to be with you from now on.",
        "Tammy: What?",
        "Sandy: Yeah, we can start where we left off. Remember the sweet, happy life that I promised you? I am still good for that promise.",
        "Tammy: If you don't leave, I will.",
        "Sandy: Wait, wait, wait.",
        "Tammy: Don't touch me; leave me alone.",
        "Sandy: You said yes to me once before and you have it in you to say yes again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: Where were we?",
        "Dinah: I think we were right here.",
        "Alan-Michael: You heading out?",
        "Dinah: No, I have lots of work to do, so you can go ahead and hold all my personal messages, okay?",
        "Alan-Michael: Yes, ma'am.",
        "Marina: What was that all about?",
        "Alan-Michael: I got a call earlier from a guy who said he found something Gus left behind for Harley and she went with Mallet...",
        "Dinah: Sorry, maybe I wasn't clear. I trust Mallet, so there's no issue. I'm not going to talk about this anymore, is that clear?",
        "Alan-Michael: Yes. Would you like me to have your car brought around?",
        "Dinah: You know what, that's a very good idea. I will take a ride to clear my head, and I will dive back to work in a moment.",
        "Alan-Michael: Good plan. Mrs. Marler would like her car brought around. She's going to go for a little ride.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Did you ever see that movie \"Ghost,\" where the guy dies and his wife is all vulnerable, and then the best friend moves in on her. That is so Mallet. He's just honing in on Harley because she's so vulnerable.",
        "Alan: What's a six-letter word for \"I told you so\"?",
        "Gus: S-h-u-t u-p. Shut up!",
        "Alan: That is six letters, but it doesn't really fit here. Why are you looking at me that way? You are the one who landed us in this mess.",
        "Gus: No, no, this is not my fault.",
        "Alan: May I remind you, Gus, you kidnapped me.",
        "Gus: You were going to kill Harley the minute you came out of the courtroom on New Year's Eve. Why don't you just admit it?",
        "Alan: And in the end, I wasn't the man you needed to worry about after all, was I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Why-- why does this just keep happening to me, all this false hope? I just want to breathe and let go. Breathe and let go. When I open my eyes, all I see is he's dead. Gus is dead.",
        "Mallet: We can't. We can't do this. Not this way. Not this time.",
        "Jonathan: Where exactly did you leave that note for Tammy?",
        "Ava: I told you, under the windshield wiper of her car. Maybe it got wet and flew off or something.",
        "Jonathan: No, I don't think so. Did you see Sandy all day?",
        "Ava: No, why?",
        "Jonathan: Because maybe he found the note and told her to go somewhere else?",
        "Ava: Where would he tell her to go?",
        "Jonathan: I don't know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: You can't think that I'd...",
        "Sandy: Marry me. It wouldn't be the first time.",
        "Tammy: Just let me leave, please. You don't want to wind up in jail, Sandy. Think! You have a restraining order against you.",
        "Sandy: Oh, yeah, that. You ripped it up. Thank you, sweetie.",
        "Tammy: What? That was it?",
        "Sandy: Pretty cool, huh?",
        "Tammy: You sent the note to come here, not Jonathan?",
        "Sandy: Uh-huh.",
        "Tammy: You set this whole thing up; you left this dress for me.",
        "Sandy: Yes, how is the dress? How does it make you feel? Does it make you feel things for me? It does, doesn't it?! I knew the minute that satin hit your skin, all the feelings for me would come flooding back. Wow.",
        "Tammy: That's not how it is, Sandy.",
        "Sandy: And I remember when you came down the wedding aisle on our wedding day. What's the matter, honey? Remember? You were like a... floating, like a goddess queen and you came straight to me.",
        "Tammy: Sandy.",
        "Sandy: And we stood in front of your whole family and all of our friends and we said that we vowed to cherish and honor and protect each other until death do us part. And there were rings, remember the rings? Oh, still are. Yup, oh, they're giving me trouble like you are.",
        "Tammy: Oh, my God.",
        "Sandy: Remember that? But we'll get back to those in a minute. Tammy-- wait, Tammy. You're my angel. And you're every bit as beautiful as you were that wedding night. And you don't know how happy it makes me that we're going to be man and wife.",
        "Tammy: I don't know if you are crazy, or if you actually believe what you're saying, but there's no way we can be together, none!",
        "Sandy: You keep saying that, but look, here we are.",
        "Tammy: No. I don't want to be with you. I don't love you. If you try the take me anywhere, Sandy, you better be ready for the fight of your life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: You just came to me right now for comfort. And the second I put my arms around you, you couldn't help but flash back to that night and then that was it, you pulled away. You couldn't be with me.",
        "Cassie: It is just the wrong time.",
        "Jeffrey: The wrong time? When is the right time?",
        "Cassie: I am not a witness in a trial.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Don't get mad and just walk away, please! Please, for once, let's just finish the damn conversation. So what, do I repulse you now?",
        "Cassie: No, you don't. You remind me how easy it is to keep secrets from me. It makes me wonder if there is anyone in the whole world I can trust, and that makes me feel small and weak and lost and I am desperate to not feel that way again. So I can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Oh, God!",
        "Gus: You've got to get off my leg, get off my leg.",
        "Alan: It's a brilliant idea you have. What's a six-letter word for imbecile?",
        "Beth: Gotcha.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: We cannot do this. It's just wrong. You know we can't; it's wrong.",
        "Harley: It was wrong the first time. Sorry, I didn't mean that that way.",
        "Mallet: It's all right.",
        "Harley: This is why I wanted out of being your partner, Mallet. Because every time I'm together with you, I'm weepy and vulnerable, and we keep telling ourselves it's going to be okay, and it's not. Don't you see that? It's not going to be okay. Because, look at me, I'm a mess.",
        "Mallet: Maybe it will just take some time.",
        "Harley: How much time is that? Like every day for the rest of my life? Because I've got to be honest with you, I don't see a light at the end of this tunnel.",
        "Mallet: You're grieving.",
        "Harley: Yes, I am. I am grieving. Part of me still thinks he's still alive. You know, like my son tells me he talks to him on the phone-- a six-year-old. And I believe that. And I wanted to buy that. And then I keep telling myself no, no, it's not true. It's nuts! The whole thing is nuts! God, I feel like I did that night in your hotel room when all of the hope was gone and all I was left with was that pain. All that pain. And you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie, what I did was so wrong. I made a huge mistake. I'm sorry; I apologize. I've apologized; I'll apologize again.",
        "Cassie: And I want to forgive you.",
        "Jeffrey: But you can't?",
        "Cassie: No. I just keep going back to the betrayal.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, then, you know, betray me. I'm serious, you know, go find someone else and even the score.",
        "Cassie: You know I am not going to do that.",
        "Jeffrey: No, I know you are not going to do that! And I know you can't get over this!",
        "Cassie: Jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: I can do this, you know. I've done it before. I can break it off, close down and move on. It's okay.",
        "Cassie: Who are you calling?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I'm going to need a place to live.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: You think this is a game, Tammy? It isn't. This is my life. A life that is meant to be shared with you.",
        "Tammy: No.",
        "Sandy: I was nothing before I met you. I know it sounds cliche, but until you came along, I was a walking cliche. A lonely guy with no one and nothing. And you have to understand that I can't go back to that.",
        "Tammy: Then go on. Go on to someone else.",
        "Sandy: One lousy secret, that's what it boils down to. One stupid, little secret that I thought I had taken care of.",
        "Tammy: Wait, are you saying that if your divorce with Ava had gone through, you never would have mentioned her for the rest of our lives?",
        "Sandy: I did it to protect you.",
        "Tammy: There is nothing to protect anymore. Marriage is about love and I love Jonathan, not you. Ow! Get off me!",
        "Sandy: You can't say that. You can't love Jonathan.",
        "Tammy: Let me go!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: What do you think is going to happen when Dinah gets to Harley and Mallet?",
        "Alan-Michael: Who says that's where she's going?",
        "Marina: Please.",
        "Alan-Michael: Okay, if , I think it's a good thing. I'm always in favor of getting the issues out in the open. You can't find love without truth, right?",
        "Marina: Oh, my goodness, did you just say the \"L\" word?",
        "Alan-Michael: It slipped out. Hey, I go to the movies. I see the beautiful babe and the giant gorilla always fall for each other. Okay, bad example, but love does conquer all, doesn't it?",
        "Marina: In the movies. The question is: Do you believe it happens in real life?",
        "Alan-Michael: Yeah. Why, don't you?",
        "Marina: I'd like to believe that. I don't know. I guess I haven't had too many good examples. Now that I'm a cop...",
        "Alan-Michael: Yeah?",
        "Marina: I don't know, I guess I just see the worst in people, you know. It makes me wonder if love really can overcome all of the self-centeredness and greed that there is in this world. And there's a lot of it. What's the matter, did I hit a nerve?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Easy, easy, easy.",
        "Alan: We got a little tangled up, Beth, playing a game of backgammon.",
        "Gus: I thought we were playing twister.",
        "Beth: Oh, yeah, I'm sure. ( Coughing )",
        "Alan: That's a nasty cough you got.",
        "Beth: Yeah? Well, I'm getting sick going back and forth up this mountain.",
        "Gus: I know a little something that will make you feel better: Why don't you just let us go.",
        "Beth: Nice try.",
        "Gus: Oh, come on. Just let us-- what do you want? What do you want from us?",
        "Alan: Gus, that's not a fair question. Perhaps all Beth really wants to do is just torture us.",
        "Gus: I don't think that's the case. I think she's a nicer person than that. I'll tell you what, we had a car crash, right? We got stuck up here for a couple of weeks without a phone and you came along and helped us, and we'll just leave it at that. What do you say?",
        "Alan: Good idea. And then you won't have to go to prison, Beth.",
        "Beth: Really?",
        "Gus: Mm-hmm. See, it's good because otherwise everybody is going to wonder why you didn't tell them that you saw us and that we were okay. What do you say?",
        "Beth: I say no, Gus. Because the problem is, you still aren't treating me with the respect I deserve! It's still little tricks and games! And poor, little Beth is in way over her head!",
        "Gus: Nice, someone's been eaves dropping?",
        "Beth: I listened to the reading of your will, Alan. I kept hoping that you would redeem yourself in my eyes, but no, you're still the same miserable bastard in death that you were in life.",
        "Alan: I provided for you in that will!",
        "Beth: An allowance? I don't care about the money. When I married you, you promised that we would be equal partners in taking back Spaulding, that I would be in charge.",
        "Alan: There is no way I could allow that, Beth! You have no experience running a company the size of Spaulding Enterprises!",
        "Beth: Well, I sure as hell had more experience than Harley or Dinah Marler. But, yeah, Dinah. Guess who is sitting in the CEO's chair? Yeah. I forgot to tell you, Harley's decided to take a break. I guess so she could spend more time with Mallet so he could comfort her in her grief. Yeah, see, there has been a couple of new developments in your absence.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: This isn't healthy, or appropriate, or anything that's positive.",
        "Mallet: Well, I'll try not to take that as an insult.",
        "Harley: Mallet, I have to tell you something important. Remember when you asked me if we were over for good, so that you could move on with Dinah and I said yes?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, and you meant it.",
        "Harley: Yeah, well, I need to be honest with you. It's just fair for all of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth Chamberlain, \"Inside The Light.\"",
        "Beth: My special episode, it's a very interesting episode. I spent a lot of time thinking about this and I think what it comes down to is, it's a boxing match between Beth's higher and lower self, and it's a question of who is going to win out. See Beth, Wednesday, March 8th, \"Inside The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Am I interrupting something?",
        "Mallet: No. No.",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Mallet: No, we found this... a hotel guest found it and it's a letter from Gus.",
        "Dinah: \"My Harley, my wife, I'm sorry, it doesn't look like I'm going to make it back to you.\" When did he write this?",
        "Mallet: We think after the crash.",
        "Dinah: Honey, I'm so sorry. Are you okay?",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Dinah: I'm sorry.",
        "Harley: I don't know why this keeps happening to me.",
        "Dinah: It's okay. It's okay.",
        "Mallet: How are you doing? What are you doing here?",
        "Dinah: Well, I heard that there was a lead and that the two of you were here. Does it matter?",
        "Mallet: No. No.",
        "Dinah: Forgive me, I didn't mean to interrupt.",
        "Harley: Dinah, I'm the one who should be asking for forgiveness here.",
        "Mallet: Harley.",
        "Dinah: What do you mean?",
        "Harley: I have to tell you something. Both of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: Marina, I'm a Spaulding. It's in my genes to want to be the best, to come out on top, no matter what I have to do to get there.",
        "Marina: Well, you're already there. You're helping to run a major corporation--",
        "Alan-Michael: Helping?! See what I'm saying? It's like it's pulling at me to be the one and only winner. To go for that rush of beating out everyone else, no matter what.",
        "Marina: Alan-Michael, I mean, I think it comes naturally. You're Alan's son.",
        "Alan-Michael: There's nothing natural about it. I don't want to feel that pull, Marina. It's like I've got no free will. I've got one path and I've got to follow it. I've got no other path; that's the only path. I don't want to get sucked into that.",
        "Marina: Well, what do you want?",
        "Alan-Michael: I want to feel that it's possible for two people to come together and make it work, even if they seem all wrong for each other.",
        "Marina: Well, most of the people in this town think that we are all wrong for each other. I think you can put my dad at the top of that list.",
        "Alan-Michael: Maybe he's right.",
        "Marina: No. No, listen, I don't buy that, okay? Because you are nothing like Alan or Phillip. You do need something more than just money and power. And I see that in you, Alan-Michael. And that's why my dad is wrong, okay? And that's why I'm willing to take my chances.",

        "Jonathan: Are you okay?",
        "Tammy: I'm fine. Really, I'm fine.",
        "Jonathan: Get out!",
        "Sandy: I'm sorry, I can't do that. Tammy and I have plans.",
        "Jonathan: You are whacked.",
        "Sandy: You don't get it, do you? You still don't get it. You're not good for her. There's no good in you.",
        "Jonathan: I will break your face!",
        "Tammy: Jonathan, don't!",
        "Sandy: Yeah! Is that what you think, that you can splatter my brains all over the place to prove your point? That seems right for you.",
        "Tammy: Stop. No, no, no. Don't!",
        "Jonathan: ( Groans ) ( glass breaking ) You thought I would go for it, didn't you? Thought I'd come here all crazy, so you'd go to the cops or Cassie, tell them Jonathan bugged out at me again? Wrong. I'm not that stupid.",
        "Sandy: Tammy, I'm not going to give up on us. You know, he'll ruin your life. I'll make it work. He'll smash it to pieces, just like that.",
        "Jonathan: Shut your mouth!",
        "Sandy: This isn't over!",
        "Jonathan: Yes it is. Yes it is. Because I know you; I know you too damn good. We're not going to play this game by your rules anymore; we're going to play by mine.",
        "Sandy: Tammy, it's your last chance. You deserve better than someone who is... twisted.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: What if I said I wasn't ready to let go.",
        "Jeffrey: Not from me, the man who makes you feel small and weak and lost. You know, you're much better off pushing me away and getting away from me as fast as you can.",
        "Cassie: You don't believe that. I don't believe that.",
        "Jeffrey: I don't-- I don't want this to end. As a matter of fact, I can't even imagine my life without you, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: I can't imagine it either.",
        "Jeffrey: But we're not doing too well here. I make you feel desperate, and that's not good. And at this rate, you're going to end up hating me. I'd much rather have you missing me.",
        "Cassie: So... this is it?",
        "Jeffrey: I think this is the best way, you know? The only way. I should go.",
        "Cassie: Jeffrey... I miss you already.",

        "Jonathan: This is where I wanted you to meet me-- if that kid didn't get his hands on my note.",
        "Tammy: I guess Sandy has been watching.",
        "Jonathan: He ruined everything I tried to do today. He twisted it into something sick.",
        "Tammy: What did you try to do today?",
        "Jonathan: I was going to invite Reva and Cassie and the whole family over here trying to bring them back to you. I don't know, bring them back to each other. I figured I took something real important from you and the least I could do is give you something back.",
        "Tammy: So, it had nothing to do with you wanting to...",
        "Jonathan: What? Marry you? No, not this time.",
        "Tammy: I should change out of this.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, wait. Come here. Everything's okay.",
        "Tammy: How did you find me, anyway?",
        "Jonathan: Luck. I don't know, maybe that freak wanted me to find you so I would bust in and go ballistic on him, and he could tell everybody he is Jonathan Randall's latest victim. Well, it doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is keeping him away from you now.",
        "Tammy: Maybe we should move.",
        "Jonathan: No.",
        "Tammy: Let's leave tonight.",
        "Jonathan: No. Sandy is not chasing us out of town. I'm not going to let him do that to us.",
        "Tammy: You heard him; he said he's not going to give up.",
        "Jonathan: Well, then, I'll make him give up.",
        "Tammy: How? What are you going to do?",

        "Tammy: I am worried.",
        "Jonathan: Well then stop. Look, hey, Tammy, if you let Sandy worm his way into your head to where you're thinking about him all of the time, then he wins, yeah? I just told you, we're going to play this game by my rules, not his.",
        "Tammy: I just don't want anybody to get hurt.",
        "Jonathan: Sometimes that can't happen.",
        "Tammy: Where are you going?",
        "Jonathan: You stay in this room, don't open the door, don't let anyone else in until I get back.",

        "Sandy: Wait, hold on, hold on. I... I just saw Tammy and Jonathan.",
        "Cassie: Oh, my God. Sandy, they're not married, are they?",
        "Sandy: No, but I tried to save her and she's still with him. I think that we--",
        "Cassie: Sandy, just stop. Just stop! I have tried to be nice and go the legal route to keep you away from her, but you clearly didn't get the message. So you just listen to me, all right? You keep away from her, you don't shadow her or I'm going to make you sorry you ever met this family, you got it?",
        "Sandy: If this is the part where I'm supposed to be scared, right? Well, it's not working.",
        "Cassie: Well, it should be. Because I am not playing around.",
        "Sandy: I'm not playing around either. And don't waste your time, trying to scare me, you don't nor does anyone else in town. Cassie, wake up! Your daughter is in love with her cousin and they're going to get married! We could have stopped them, but you don't listen to me. You never listen to them. So I'm going to have to handle it on my own, my own way. And I'm guessing you're not going to like it.",

        "Harley: You are two of the most important people in my life. And now that Gus is gone, and I've done what I've done to grieve him, I can't lie to you anymore-- to either of you.",
        "Dinah: Harley, you're the most honest person I've ever known.",
        "Mallet: You don't have to tell us what a rough time you've had lately; we know that.",
        "Harley: Yeah, but what I haven't told you-- I've been dishonest about my intentions.",
        "Dinah: Sweetie, if you want to come back to Spaulding Enterprises, you know that the CEO title is all yours. Absolutely.",
        "Harley: It's not the job.",
        "Dinah: Then honey, what is it?",
        "Harley: Okay, here it is. I thought that I could just flip a switch and be super-cop, and that would fix everything, going back to the force, but I realize that... I realize that I need to grieve Gus. I need to face that pain and that loss on my own. And only then will I be able to trust myself with you and know that you trust me.",
        "Mallet: I trust you now.",
        "Harley: Still, it's going to take a while. So, I can't work on that case anymore. And that's it. Anyway, I should get back to town.",

        "Alan: Sooner or later someone is going to find us and then you will be the one in these chains. What is it going to be like in prison? For once, you won't have to play the part; you will be the victim.",
        "Beth: ( Laughing ) Bring it on, yeah.",
        "Gus: Look, can we please-- she's a nice person. You're very nice. You put other people in front of you. I've seen you do it a thousand times. So you wouldn't do this. I mean you wouldn't end up hurting us, something as extreme as--",
        "Beth: What are you saying, Gus? You saying that I'm weak? That I'm incapable of staying the course? Is that what you're saying?",
        "Alan: We're not saying you're weak, Beth. But we know that when push comes to shove, you always fold. I mean you have a history of that. So why don't you just throw in the towel now, so we can all go home-- ow! (Groans )",
        "Beth: You think-- you think that I can't keep it up, Alan?! Watch me.",
        "Gus: My leg.",
        "Alan: Oh. Maybe things got weird after all that went down and things were all so clear that I could never get this right so tell me what your plans are tell me what you're doing the only thing I hope it gives me is a picture of you...",

        "Dinah: I feel awful.",
        "Mallet: Me, too. Maybe we can change that.",
        "Dinah: Hey, um, you know, I don't-- I hate it that my mind jumps to jealousy all of the time. And, um, if I'm going to keep imagining that things are happening when you and Harley work together...",
        "Mallet: You know what, it's all right. I understand that you feel jealous. And we're going to get past that. We're going to get through that. Okay? Anyway, you're kind of cute when you're jealous.",
        "Dinah: Shut up.",
        "Mallet: ( Laughing ) It adds a little spice.",
        "Dinah: Are you saying we're dull?",
        "Mallet: I'm not saying we're dull. I think we're pretty good together. We've been in this room 20 minutes and we haven't even shown each how good we are together.",

        "Harley: Yeah, fine. They're fine. They're two bugs in a rug.",
        "Marina: Well, you see there? I told you that it would be good for Dinah and Mallet to see each other. Now, I guess you'll have to be in charge for a little while, at least until Dinah gets back.",
