        "Beth starts to frantically wipe down all fingerprints at the cabin and tells Gus that she is sorry that he got drug into this but since he will let Alan go he has to die with him. She leaves with all intentions to leave them at the cabin and heads home, although she hears a clock ticking letting her know that time for Gus and Alan is running out. She goes to Company where she runs into Harley and tells her that she needs to move on. She remembers back to the night before Alan's hearing when she slept with him to make him think that she was truly on his side, just to get served with divorce papers. She also remembers back to getting pills from Rick, which is how she kept Alan and Gus sedated. Beth passes out at Company, and Rick takes her to Cedars. Harley follows grabbing Beth's things and finds the key to the cabin. Lillian, Harley, and Rick try to calm Beth, who is running a high fever; down as she keeps saying that she has to get \"back there\". Rick comes back with Beth's tests and tells her that she is pregnant.

She breaks down and starts to tell Mallet about Gus and Alan but Rick shows up and takes her back to the hospital. Harley comes back to see how she is doing and Beth tells her that she needs to tell her something. Seeing Harley's badge she changes her mind and then just tells everyone about her pregnancy. Mallet gets a mysterious call and leaves with Beth yelling out to stop him. Harley goes out to the hall and calls Mallet to tell him that something is up with Beth, looking at the key.

        "Alan: Beth!",
        "Alan: What are you doing?",
        "Gus: See what she's doing? Beth, this is not like you.",
        "Alan: Beth, what are you doing?",
        "Beth: You're bullying me for the last time, Alan. You thought that you could just humiliate me, that you could just divorce me, pretend I didn't exist. You made me disappear. Well, let's see how you like oblivion when I'm the one sitting in Springfield in my nice easy chair.",
        "Alan: Beth, listen to me. You cannot leave us here because we will die.",
        "Beth: You mean someone like me couldn't slay the great Alan Spaulding! That's right. And you, I seem to remember an incidence with an open mike and a room full of people at a Christmas party. Remember that?",
        "Gus: Yeah, that was terrible; I shouldn't die for that.",
        "Beth: Well, you know what? You're probably right, you shouldn't. But you see, if I let you go, the first thing you'll do is set him free. So I guess you're just collateral damage. ( Coughing ) I would enjoy what little time I had left, boys. And don't worry, I hear freezing to death isn't really all that bad. You just fall asleep. Sweet dreams.",
        "Alan: Beth, you can't let this happen. You're not that cold!",
        "Beth: Oh, but, Alan, you see, that I am. You should be proud of yourself: You finally turned me into a true Spaulding.",
        "Gus: Beth. Beth!",
        "Alan: Don't leave us here, Beth.",
        "Gus: Ah, come on, Beth. Please.",
        "Alan: Beth, for God's sake, we'll die! Beth!",
        "Gus: Beth!",
        "Alan: Beth, don't do this! Knowing it ain't really smart... remember the sanitarium room?! The joker ain't the only fool who'll do anything for you laying out another lie, thinking 'bout a life of crime that's what I'll have to do to keep me away from you ( instrumental music playing ) lovers, I know you've had a few but hide your heart beneath the covers and tell 'em they're the only one and others, they know just what I'm going through and it's a-hard to be a lover when you say you're only in it for fun playing with the queen of hearts, knowing it ain't really smart the joker ain't the only fool who'll do anything for you playing with the queen of hearts.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: I'll be home soon. I just didn't want you to worry.",
        "Lillian: Are you back from the spa?",
        "Beth: Ah, not yet. The roads are really icy up here. ( Coughs )",
        "Lillian: You sound terrible. Where are you?",
        "Beth: I, uh... I'm staying at a nice little inn off Route 8. I thought I'd stay here tonight and then come back tomorrow. Like I said, I just wanted to call you so you didn't worry. ( Coughs )",
        "Lillian: Are you sick?",
        "Beth: No, no. I'm just tired-- of a lot of things. I'll see you tomorrow, Mom. I love you. ( Clock ticking ) ( clock ticking getting louder ) My cell phone. Oh, did I leave it the cabin? ( Breathing heavily ) It's here. You see, Alan, I can be as ruthless as you are. There you are. Good riddance. ( Clock ticking )",
        "( Clock ticking )",
        "Alan: You killed me.",
        "Beth: ( Gasping ) ( whispering ) It's a dream. It's a dream. You've got to stay calm. You're in charge; you're in control. You're Mrs. Alan Spaulding.",
        "Waitress: Mrs. Spaulding? Are you sure I can't get you something to eat? A girl can't live on coffee alone.",
        "Beth: I'm not hungry. Thanks.",
        "Waitress: Okay. ( Clock ticking )",
        "Beth: You know, on second thought, I'll have two eggs over easy, bacon and throw in a couple of pancakes there, too.",
        "Waitress: Great.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Randall: Ms. Raines? I got your message, but I'm not sure I understand.",
        "Beth: Then let me explain it to you, Mr. Randall. I am still Mrs. Alan Spaulding despite those little divorce papers you sent me.",
        "Randall: I was just doing what Mr. Spaulding had instructed me to--",
        "Beth: Mr. Spaulding is dead. His instructions died with him as did his mousy wife. This is your retainer; you work for me now. And your first assignment is to find every copy of those papers you drew up for Alan and shred them. No one must ever know they existed.",
        "Randall: But I can't--",
        "Beth: I need to be seen as the noble widow, not some poor hapless creature Alan was about to cast off. And as my lawyer, I need you to help me establish the proper image. Don't you agree?",
        "Randall: Consider it done, Mrs. Spaulding.",
        "Beth: Thank you very much. This is easier than I thought. ( Clock ticking ) You know, ah, I'm going to have a glass of champagne with that, too. ( Coughing )",
        "Harley: Wow, Beth, that doesn't sound good.",
        "Beth: I'm fine.",
        "Harley: A nasty cough and champagne first thing in the morning. What are we celebrating?",
        "Beth: A new life, because life does go on, Harley-- whether we want it to or not.",
        "Harley: Yes. Gus and I were just beginning our life together. Oh.",
        "Beth: Harley, how long are you going to keep that candle burning for Gus?",
        "Harley: Well, it's not just for Gus. It's for Zach and Jude, too.",
        "Beth: Yes, but he's not coming back.",
        "Harley: I know that. In my head I know that. ( Clocking ticking )",
        "Zach: You know where Gus is, don't you?",
        "Beth: What? No, I don't know why you would say that, Zach, I don't know.",
        "Zach: Yes you do. He's in heaven, right, Mommy?",
        "Harley: Mm-hmm. Yes, he is because they need him there more than we need him, right?",
        "Zach: But we need him, too. And Grandpa Alan.",
        "Harley: Yes. Do me a favor. Would you go into the kitchen and check on Grandpa Buzz, make sure he's not getting into a trouble in there. Thanks, bud. First, his own father, and now this. And I have no idea what it is doing to him.",
        "Beth: Well, I can understand why you would worry about that Harley, but you know kids, they're very resilient. In fact, I went through a lot as a child as you know. I survived. And let's face it, our kids are probably better off without Alan's influence.",
        "Harley: Well, I can understand you saying that, but Alan was devoted to his grandkids. I'll give him that much. And he loved you-- no he adored you, Beth. He made that perfectly clear to me at all times.",
        "Beth: Yes, well, Alan gave with one hand and took away with the other. Harley, he killed Phillip. He would've killed you, too. And, yes, it's a tragedy that Gus had to die trying to protect you, but he was right, Alan had to be stopped.",
        "Harley: Wow. I've never heard you so--",
        "Beth: What, realistic? Honest? Get used to it. Harley, look, I understand how much it hurts. I know how difficult this is, but you have to get by it and move on. You have to.",
        "Harley: What the hell is going on with you? ( clock ticking )",
        "Beth: I uh... I don't know what you mean?",
        "Harley: Really? Beth, you're pale. You're coughing; you're drinking. Whoa, whoa.",
        "Rick: Whoa. Hey, what's the occasion, guys?",
        "Harley: I'm not sure.",
        "Beth: New life.",
        "Rick: New life, huh?",
        "Beth: I'm going to have another.",
        "Rick: It might take some time.",
        "Beth: No, silly. Another glass of champagne. You want one?",
        "Rick: No, Beth, I'm fine.",
        "Beth: Come on, Rick. Don't be a stick in the mud. Why don't you have some fun.",
        "Rick: No, you're having enough fun for both of us. ( Whispers ) What's going on?",
        "Beth: Hey, I want to have another one.",
        "Rick: What happened, what's going on?",
        "Harley: Something is bothering her.",
        "Beth: Yeah, well, of course something is bothering me. I feel sad, for you and your boys. You suffered a terrible loss and if I could turn back the clock, I would. If I could go back to that awful day that I--",
        "Harley: What day?",
        "Beth: The day Alan and Gus disappeared. Of course that's the day that I'm talking about. The day everything went so horr--",
        "Rick: Beth? Sweetie.",
        "Harley: Whoa, whoa, whoa.",
        "Rick: Whoa, whoa, whoa. She is burning up; she is on fire. I've got to get her to the hospital.",
        "Harley: Yeah. I'll come with you. Let me just get her stuff here.",
        "Harley: Homestead hills.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lillian: It's all right, honey, I'm here. You're going to be okay, Beth.",
        "Rick: Lillian, she's extremely dehydrated. More fluids.",
        "Lillian: You're going to feel so much better when you have all the fluids in you, honey. You really are.",
        "Harley: Do you mind if I hang out?",
        "Rick: No, that's fine. ( Clock ticking )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Who would have guessed she could have been so ruthless?",
        "Gus: Oh, it's pointless, anyway. The whole thing's moot; we're goners. I can feel the last little bit of my life slipping out as we speak.",
        "Alan: It's all your fault. You kidnapped me or I would have never been in that car.",
        "Gus: No, you would have been out trying to kill my wife. I didn't know you served her with divorce papers. No wonder why she slipped off the edge.",
        "Alan: She testified against me and she was planning to keep me in that sanitarium forever.",
        "Gus: Hmm. So now you're going to die like a drowned frozen rat. Yeah, that's an improvement.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Shut up! Shut...",
        "Rick: Hey, take it easy. Beth.",
        "Lillian: Come on, sweetie, just breath. You've got to breath and relax. Just relax.",
        "Rick: It's all right.",
        "Beth: What have I done?",
        "Harley: What is she talking about?",
        "Rick: She's delirious; her fever is extremely high.",
        "Beth: Harley. Harley. Have you ever done something you regret?",
        "Lillian: Sweetheart, stop.",
        "Harley: Something that you wished that you--",
        "Lillian: You've got to breathe. I'm afraid that she's hurting herself here.",
        "Beth: Have you?!",
        "Harley: Lillian.",
        "Beth: Have you?",
        "Rick: It's okay, it's all right.",
        "Beth: Do you know what it feels like to wish that you could go back?",
        "Lillian: Sh-sh-sh. Sweetheart, it's okay.",
        "Rick: Don't fight. Don't fight it, sweetheart.",
        "Beth: Don't. I wish that I could go back to that night.",
        "Harley: What night?",
        "Rick: It's okay, sweetheart.",
        "Harley: Beth, what night? What night?!",
        "Alan: Rumor has it that you have been working Gus to keep me locked up in here.",
        "Beth: That's ridiculous, Alan.",
        "Alan: Yes it's ridiculous. It would be very foolish, too. You know how claustrophobic I am, how much I hate this place. Now, if I thought for one minute you were capable of doing that, I don't know what I would do.",
        "Beth: Not much, not from in here.",
        "Alan: Don't count on it, Beth. As you see, I've already been declared insane. What more can they do to me?",
        "Beth: We both know you aren't insane, Alan. In fact, I have never seen you so confident, so in control. I don't know how you do it. It's really very impressive and attractive. Do you find me attractive, Alan?",
        "Alan: I always have, you know that.",
        "Beth: Yes. There has always been something there, hasn't there? You know what I've been thinking?",
        "Alan: What?",
        "Beth: I've been thinking that when you get home, we should make this marriage a real marriage.",
        "Alan: Ooh, that sounds very appealing.",
        "Beth: Doesn't it, though. Yes. So tomorrow night when you get home, we will have a real celebration.",
        "Alan: Beth, why should we wait until tomorrow?",
        "Beth: ( Laughing ) Alan, I hardly think that this is the place--",
        "Alan: Well, you said that you wanted me and the doors are locked.",
        "Beth: I do want you.",
        "Alan: Then why don't you show me that you are loyal to me, and that you are my wife.",
        "Lillian: Let the sedative do it's work, sweetheart. Close your eyes.",
        "Beth: Don't let me dream. Don't let me dream.",
        "Harley: Okay, I won't. I won't.",
        "Beth: Don't let me dream.",
        "Harley: I won't. I won't.",
        "Rick: Lillian, I'm going to take the blood to the lab myself, okay?",
        "Lillian: She's just burning up. She's burning up. I've got to get another compress. You hold onto her.",
        "Harley: I will, I will. I'll stay with her.",
        "Lillian: I'll be right back; I'm getting another compress.",
        "Beth: ( Breathing heavily )",
        "Harley: Here, Beth, here. Put this on your head.",
        "Beth: I'm fine, I'm fine.",
        "Harley: You're fine. You're burning up; you have a 104 fever. Sweetie, you're spending too much time out in the cold. ( Clock ticking ) playing with the queen of hearts, knowing it ain't really smart...",
        "Beth: Why would you say something like that to me?",
        "Harley: Because when Mallet and I saw you by the accident site. Remember? On Gus' birthday, there you were, drudging through the snow.",
        "Beth: Yes, I was trying to pay my respects to Gus and Alan; I was trying to get closure.",
        "Harley: Did you? Did you get closure?",
        "Beth: Yes. I did exactly what Alan would have done. I've gone on and I am never looking back. Oh, stop. (Sobbing ) baby, I know it makes you sad but when they're handing out the heartaches you know you got to have you some playing with the queen of hearts knowing it ain't really smart...",
        "Beth: You know, I think what Rick gave me is kicking in.",
        "Harley: Good.",
        "Beth: Harley, you don't have to stay here baby-sit me. I'm sure you have better things to do.",
        "Harley: No. I think actually I'll hang around and wait for your test results, if you don't mind.",
        "Beth: Well, what if I have is contagious? I wouldn't want to give anything to your boys. ( Coughs )",
        "Lillian: Oh, that sounds bad, that cough, honey.",
        "Harley: Okay.",
        "Lillian: Oh, Beth.",
        "Harley: You've made your point. ( Laughs ) I will go. But I'm going to come back later to check on you, okay?",
        "Lillian: I think you better call me before you come back, Harley, okay?",
        "Harley: Yeah. That's probably a good idea.",
        "Lillian: Sweetie.",
        "Beth: I outlasted her, Mom.",
        "Lillian: Who?",
        "Lillian: Harley. And all the Spaulding wives-- not to mention the Spaulding men. One by one, Alan either drove them away or killed them off, but not me. I'm the last one standing.",
        "Lillian: You have always been a survivor, always.",
        "Beth: Yes, I have.",
        "Beth: Thank God I found you, Alan. I couldn't just sit back and let you go free. I would have been the one out in the cold. There's no one out there to save me anymore. So I have to take things in my own hands. I'm in charge, I can do this. I wasn't expecting to have the two of you, but that's okay. Gus needs to learn a few lessons, too. This little break will be good for all of us. I'm just not sure what will happen when you wake up. You're hurt, so you need my help, but, still, I have to make sure that I keep the upper hand or things could go bad. Now, how do I keep you quiet? Think, Beth, think.",
        "Rick: Are you okay?",
        "Beth: Yeah, I pulled a muscle in my shoulder playing tennis. I'm taking ibuprofen for it.",
        "Rick: You know you should have a doctor take a look. We have a new sports doctor at the hospital. Single, funny, charming. Single, kind of looks like George Clooney-- did I say single?",
        "Beth: Subtle. Very subtle. No, I've had had this before. It goes away on its own. It does bother me at night, though. You couldn't give me a prescription, could you?",
        "Rick: Yeah, I could give you one for something a little stronger, okay, but you've got to be very careful with this. You've got to take it in small doses, okay?",
        "Beth: Oh, Rick, come on, you know me: Everything in moderation. Here you go, boys. There's something to keep you warm. ( Clock ticking )",
        "Lillian: Beth, it says here you told admissions you were on no medications, but didn't Rick give you a prescription for your shoulder?",
        "Beth: Yes, well, I took some and threw the rest away. I didn't want them in the house.",
        "Lillian: Okay.",
        "Beth: You know something, Mom, I'm feeling a lot better; I'm going to go home.",
        "Lillian: No, you are-- Beth, you are staying right here until your fever is down.",
        "Lizzie: Mom?",
        "Lillian: Get in that bed.",
        "Lizzie: Are you all right?",
        "Beth: You called her?",
        "Lillian: Of course I called her. Now lie down. You have to stay here with your mother and do not let her out of the bed. I'll be right back. You stay here, sweetie.",
        "Lizzie: Are you all right? Uncle Rick said you fainted at Company.",
        "Beth: I'm fine, honey. Uncle Rick and Nana are being melodramatic.",
        "Lizzie: Is there anything I can do?",
        "Beth: You've already done everything just be being here. You're the best medicine. Listen, what do you say we blow this place, huh? Can you drive me home?",
        "Lizzie: Nana just said to--",
        "Beth: Nana is a worry-wart. Yes, I'm sick, but I will recuperate at home, okay? So, you run down, you get the car and I will meet you down front, okay? Uh-huh?",
        "Lizzie: Are you okay?",
        "Beth: Yes, yes. Go. Go before Nana gets back. ( Clock ticking )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Hold on, hold on. Excuse me, I need to I.D. that body before you put it in the cooler. ( Clock ticking ) thank you.",
        "Rick: Beth.",
        "Beth: ( Gasps )",
        "Rick: What do you think you're doing? You're not going anywhere? You've got to take care of yourself, honey.",
        "Beth: I'm going to go home, Rick.",
        "Rick: Just follow Dr. Rick's orders and I will explain to you--",
        "Beth: Rick, I'm a little run down. Just give me a prescription and I'll be out of your hair.",
        "Rick: A prescription is not going to change your condition.",
        "Beth: Condition, what are you talking about? Is there or is there not something wrong with me?",
        "Rick: Well, that depends on how you look at it. Beth, you're pregnant.",
        "Beth: What?",
        "Rick: Sweetheart, you're pregnant.",
        "Beth: No.",
        "Rick: Yes, you are.",
        "Beth: No. Rick, they made a mistake. They switched my blood with somebody else.",
        "Rick: Beth, I ran a test three times. You're pregnant. Now just-- lay down. Listen, honey, you don't have to tell me this now, but who the father is--",
        "Beth: It's Alan. It's Alan. ( Sobbing )",
        "Rick: Alan? Alan Spaulding? Were you drunk?",
        "Beth: In the usual way!",
        "Rick: Oh, God, I'm sorry. Are you okay?",
        "Beth: It was the night before his hearing-- oh, Rick, Alan's baby is growing inside of me. I can't raise another child without him as the father.",
        "Rick: Listen to me. Listen to me, stop this. You're not going to do this alone.",
        "Beth: You don't understand, Rick. Some day this child is going to look at me with Alan's eyes and I'm going to feel so guilty.",
        "Rick: Why? Why would you feel guilty? Beth, it's not like you could have prevented what happened. It's not like-- you were nowhere near this car when it went off the road. Why would you feel guilty?",
        "Beth: After.",
        "Rick: After what? After what-- you could have what, mourned longer, Beth? Look at you, you're mourning right now. Sweetheart... Beth:( Sobbing )",
        "Rick: You've got obligations. You've got children who are dependent on you; you have another one on the way. You've got to pull yourself together, Beth. And I will help you every step of the way. You know I will. So, this is what we're going to do. You're going to stay overnight-- no arguments-- and I'm going to get you the best room in the hospital, and you're going to lay down and you're going to get some rest, okay. Just lay down. Lay back. ( Clock ticking )",
        "Beth: I've got to get out of here. Think, think.",
        "Lizzie: Mom, I'm double- parked out front; are you still coming?",
        "Beth: Come on, get me out of here. ( Coughing )",
        "Lizzie: Mom, why are we here?",
        "Beth: Because I need to think, Lizzie, and this is the one place where my head can be completely clear.",
        "Lizzie: There's a new one.",
        "Beth: No. You see, everything between these walls is cut and dry. It's not about emotion. It's just means and end. Your grandfather knows that better than anyone.",
        "Lizzie: Mom.",
        "Beth: What?",
        "Lizzie: You just spoke about Granddad in the present tense.",
        "Beth: That's because he's still with us, sweetie.",
        "Lizzie: I believe that, too. Like he's not really gone. Even after the terrible stuff that he did toward the end, I still miss him so much, Mom. You do, too, don't you? Mom?",
        "Beth: Lizzie, come here. I know that you never approved of my marriage to your grandfather. Listen to me, what would you say if I told you--",
        "Lizzie: It was a joke, a power play, that's it. Can you imagine if it had been the real deal? What if you guys had kids--",
        "Beth: Don't say that, Lizzie. Don't say that.",

        "Beth: Harley?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, Harley said that you told her you're looking forward to moving on and putting Alan's death behind you and I thought that's good because you've been just as interested as me to close this case, right?",
        "Beth: Honey, why don't you go down and say hello to your Aunt Alex. I'll come and get you as soon as I'm finished with Detective Mallet.",

        "Mallet: Wow. Speaking of divorce, I was just... ( clock ticking ) ...was getting a divorce and his wife found out about it, and she shot him dead. Talk about not being able to take the news. Playing with the queen of hearts, knowing it ain't really smart..",
