        "Marah: What's going to happen?",
        "Jeffrey: Do you trust me?",
        "Michelle: Carrie. She can't be alive.",

        "Michelle: Danny, we have to leave.",
        "Danny: What? Why?",
        "Michelle: We've got to go. I'm sorry, but we have to go.",
        "Danny: Is something wrong with robbie? Did nico call?",
        "Michelle: No, no, no.",
        "Danny: Then what? Did you get bad news?",
        "Michelle: No. I didn't even open it yet. I...",
        "Danny: Then what's the matter.",
        "Michelle: Danny, please, i just...",
        "Danny: Two minutes ago, i thought you were fine.",
        "Michelle: I have a really bad feeling. Please, we have to go, okay?",
        "Danny: I...",
        "Michelle: Please?",
        "Danny: Okay. Okay, all right, let's go.",
        "Alexandra: Alan? What happened to you?",
        "Alan: What happened?",
        "Alexandra: Yes. Your clothes are all a mess, you look rather disheveled. What happened?",
        "Alan: Well, alexandra, I have just had to make one of the hardest choices I've ever made in my life.",
        "Alexandra: About what?",
        "Alan: Justice and retribution.",
        "Alexandra: Okay. Let me make you a drink.",
        "Alan: I remember when you used to make me a drink a few months ago. The drink made me think I was going mad so you could force me from the company.",
        "Alexandra: Yes. Yes, I remember.",
        "Alan: I also remember that i didn't take revenge on you. I didn't call the police. I didn't send you out of the country, did I? No, as a matter of fact, I even asked you back into my life.",
        "Alexandra: Yes. (Laughs) yes, you did, alan.",
        "Alan: But I told you... i told you then that one day all hell was going to break loose. Well, I want you to know that day has come.",
        "Marah: Jeffrey...",
        "Jeffrey: Ssh. Now, listen to me. There's something I've got to tell you, okay. It's important that you hear this.",
        "Reva: I think maybe it's time that you told me the whole story.",
        "Josh: I don't want you to be involved.",
        "Reva: I am involved. I was the moment you were. Your life is my life, bud. You've got to know that by now.",
        "Josh: I do know that and that's what makes this so incredibly hard for me. I did something... terrible. Terrible. (Sobbing)",
        "Reva: Tell me.",
        "Josh: No, I can'T.",
        "Reva: Tell me. It's not going to change the way I feel about you. Nothing ever can, because I know the kind of man you are. You carried this alone long enough. I'm a strong woman, joshua, you know that. Let me share the load.",
        "Alexandra: Alan, you've never been big on letting bygones be bygones. And I have to admit, I've had my hopes.",
        "Alan: Thank you.",
        "Alexandra: May the condemned ask why the sudden about-face?",
        "Alan: I want you to know, alexandra, that I am aware of what you and brad green have been up to with third world sales of antimonius. And so does the federal government.",
        "Alexandra: Wait a minute. Wait a minute, how long have you known this?",
        "Alan: Since the very beginning.",
        "Alexandra: And what do you mean, the federal government?",
        "Alan: They just put the whole thing together.",
        "Alexandra: Put what together, alan? What is it? Are we being investigated? Subpoenaed? What?",
        "Alan: No, no, no, not yet, not yet.",
        "Alexandra: Well, then...",
        "Alan: Look, I was tipped off.",
        "Alexandra: You were tipped off?",
        "Alan: Yes.",
        "Alexandra: Tipped off. Well, that's wonderful then, isn't it?",
        "Alan: No. Alexandra, there is nothing wonderful about this.",
        "Alexandra: Now just hear me out, please. I mean, that gives us a chance to correct any situations before the stockholders get wind of this, right?",
        "Alan: \"Correct?\" So you and brad greene can go out and shred every piece of information that might implicate you? No, that's not going to happen. I am going to give the federal government the right to impound and secure the records of the pharmaceutical division.",
        "Alexandra: (Laughs) oh, god, alan. What? Why? This could be disastrous for spaulding. You know, there'll be more heads rolling than just brad greene's and mine. Yours, for example.",
        "Alan: No, no, no, no, no. I am going to walk away a free man.",
        "Alexandra: All right, something doesn't make sense here. I don't understand. What is it you're not telling, me, alan?",
        "Alan: Sit down, alexandra. I'm going to tell you something that I've only admitted to one other person. A young woman. It's about a young woman that i have been keeping a secret about for a very long time.",
        "Danny: No. I'll check on robbie and meet you in the living room. I'll be right back.",
        "Michelle: (Sighs)",
        "Danny: Robbie's asleep. Nico's watching a movie.",
        "Michelle: Good. Good, great. Okay. Um...",
        "Danny: Michelle? Are you going to tell me what you're freaking out about?",
        "Michelle: I will, danny, okay? I just have to make sure...",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Michelle: ...That it's over and that everyone is safe.",
        "Danny: What the hell is going on? What are you talking about? Are you... are you in some kind of trouble?",
        "Michelle: No. No, I'm not. I don'T... oh, god, not anymore. I don't know. I don't know if I am.",
        "Danny: All right, just stop. Stop, stop. Sit down. Sit. Calm down. Now, just tell me.",
        "Michelle: Okay, uh...",
        "Danny: What? What is it?",
        "Michelle: Danny, look, you've got to believe me that when she came to me-- when she came to us-- you know, we thought she was nice, we thought she was interesting. I didn't know that she was really going to be...",
        "Danny: Who? Who? Wait, who? Who is she?",
        "Michelle: We listened to her because it seemed like our dreams were coming true. I mean, how could we not? And then, even as she was telling us about these terrible things about our fathers.",
        "Danny: Is this about your dad?",
        "Michelle: Yes. Yes. And the creepiest part of it is she wanted to hurt us to punish them. I mean, we could have died. We all could have died, and marah... josh shot her, so it's supposed to be...",
        "Danny: Michelle. Stop, stop. Just stop. You're not making any sense. I need you... look at me. I need you to take a deep breath. Take a deep breath.",
        "Michelle: (Breathes deeply)",
        "Danny: Okay. Now start over at the beginning, all right?",
        "Michelle: The beginning.",
        "Alan: 30 years ago, a young woman died because of what i did.",
        "Josh: She died and we walked away. All five of us. Never told a soul.",
        "Michelle: There was this secret that was buried all these years and probably would have stayed buried forever but this woman named carrie came along, literally out of nowhere, and she was talking to me and to marina and marah. First, it was about dreams and wishes and then, little by little, she started telling us this story, this horrible story.",
        "Josh: I honestly believed i would go to my grave without ever telling this story to anyone. I almost did.",
        "Alan: Carrie wanted all of us to pay for what it had cost her- - her niece's life. But that's not the way it turned out.",
        "Michelle: So, we all thought it was over, that carrie was gone. Only now, I'm not really sure what to think. I'm so scared, danny.",
        "Danny: Come here. There is nothing to be scared about. Sit down. I want you to tell me the story that she told you. All of it. Don't leave anything out.",
        "Michelle: Okay. It was a night in october, before the fair, down by the river, closed down. And, my dad...",
        "Alexandra: Oh, alan. Alan, please tell me why would you do a thing like this.",
        "Alan: Because I was angry.",
        "Alexandra: At whom? Maryanne?",
        "Alan: No, no, no. The business. The way brandon was treating me, my personal life. I needed a change, alexandra. I needed some excitement, something fun.",
        "Alexandra: Fun? This is what you call fun?",
        "Alan: No, no, no. It was just a challenge, that's all. Maryanne was a beautiful girl. I wanted the challenge of getting her to sit at our table, to have a beer, to get in the car with us. You see, it was just a game, that's all. I have to admit I was pretty excited when she got in the front seat beside me.",
        "Alexandra: Well, it's too bad you didn't keep her right close to you as you went off that bridge.",
        "Alan: No, no. Alexandra, we tried to save her. It was dark. It was very late at night. The current took her away and she was gone!",
        "Alexandra: Okay, alan, you've kept this in all this time. Why tell me now? Why now?",
        "Alan: Because you're my sister, that's why.",
        "Alexandra: Why, darling, i was your sister then, too, so why now?",
        "Alan: Because there is a deal in the works.",
        "Alexandra: What kind of a deal.",
        "Alan: I would face reduced charges in maryanne's death for exchange of complete cooperation in the probe against spaulding pharmaceuticals.",
        "Alexandra: That's why you're willing to have all those papers impounded-- to save your own miserable skin.",
        "Alan: No, no, no, no. That's not it at all.",
        "Alexandra: That's not it, alan? Then what is it? Tell me what it is. Because it seems to me from where I sit that you've found a way to come out of this, you know, smelling like a rose. All you have to do is serve me up to the feds for some investigation about what?",
        "Jeffrey: Marah, people with terrible traumas make terrible witnesses.",
        "Marah: Jeffrey, I know what i did.",
        "Jeffrey: You think you do. Don't forget, I saw your confusion that night.",
        "Marah: I told you exactly what happened, minute by minute.",
        "Jeffrey: No, marah. You know, I've seen people convinced, utterly convinced, that what they remember seeing and hearing was actually the way it happened, when in actual fact, it was completely the furthest thing away from the truth. I've seen that happen.",
        "Marah: Why would I make something up?",
        "Jeffrey: You wouldn'T. You wouldn't, consciously. But sometimes the mind plays tricks. Especially when it's in shock or when it's confused by guilt or when it's desperate for another outcome.",
        "Marah: Okay. Okay, you know what? I have had millions of crazy thoughts going on in my head since that night, but I know what happened. Everything... everything is clear to me now.",
        "Jeffrey: Everything's clear to you, maybe, because you're afraid of what might happen to your father?",
        "Marah: Do you really believe that?",
        "Jeffrey: I believe that you're in no condition to be making a confession.",
        "Marah: Jeffrey, I wish that i couldn't, okay? I wish that I was still confused about what happened. It would make it so much easier for me, but I'm not.",
        "Jeffrey: So you say.",
        "Marah: Okay. Jeffrey, for the last time, i shot carrie.",
        "Jeffrey: Marah, stop this.",
        "Marah: I picked up that gun! I saw it!",
        "Jeffrey: Stop it right there! I can't let you.",
        "Marah: You can't let me what?",
        "Jeffrey: (Sighs) here. Take it. Find a lawyer. Tell him everything you remember about that night, but whatever you do, marah, please, don't say another word about it to me. Do you understand?",
        "Reva: Why did... why did you wait so long to tell me?",
        "Josh: I couldn't bring you into it, reva.",
        "Reva: Couldn't let me in.",
        "Josh: There are some things...",
        "Reva: Joshua, I love you.",
        "Josh: (Sobbing) I know. But see, that'S... every time i reminded myself of that, I would become even more ashamed of what I did, and I had already gotten marah into danger because of this stupid thing. I couldn't risk doing the same thing with you, reva.",
        "Reva: So you kept silent. And you pulled back, even after I'd forgiven you for shayne's accident, you... you wouldn't come home.",
        "Josh: Reva.",
        "Reva: And you... you just shut off again and again, you shut down completely because of this secret!",
        "Josh: I didn'T... I didn't know how to handle it. I could not imagine myself going to you and telling you about this accident and telling you about leaving this woman at the bottom of the river and telling you about how we had made a secret pact to never speak of it again. I... and I'm sorry, because I know that that doesn't speak much for the faith that I have in you, but there it is. I...",
        "Reva: I'm sorry you felt that way.",
        "Josh: It was hell, because if there was ever a time that i needed you, this was it, and i wanted so badly to come to you and put my arms around you and close my eyes and just tell you the whole story.",
        "Reva: But you were afraid.",
        "Josh: And there was something else, too. When you started having these visions a few months ago, i started thinking that you were going to put the whole thing together, and that also made me afraid.",
        "Reva: What did she look like?",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Reva: Maryanne. The woman who drowned.",
        "Josh: I don't understand.",
        "Reva: Was she tall? Thin?",
        "Josh: She was both of those things. She was tall and thin and she had dark hair that... shoulder- length.",
        "Reva: She wore loose, right? She wore loose. And the night... the night you went off the bridge, she was wearing a pale-colored dress. Peach or pink?",
        "Josh: Peach. How could you possibly know that?",
        "Reva: I... I saw her.",
        "Josh: Are you saying that you've seen a photograph of maryanne?",
        "Reva: No. Her.",
        "Josh: How is that possible, reva? It was a long time... oh.",
        "Reva: Yes. It's happened a couple of times.",
        "Josh: You knew it was her?",
        "Reva: No, not until now. But this young woman has... she's been appearing to me and she matched your description exactly.",
        "Josh: Where did you see her?",
        "Reva: At the house and then here the other day, when I came to see you. She was standing right behind you. I just realized this is the first time this has ever happened.",
        "Josh: But, no. You've had these impressions...",
        "Reva: Yes, images. Images and sensations, yes, but this is the first time I've ever connected with someone from the other side, and I know she... she was coming to me because she looked right at me and she held her arms out to me.",
        "Josh: Did she seem angry?",
        "Reva: No. No, she was more like worried or anxious.",
        "Josh: Yeah. Well, maybe that's because I'm still out and about and I'm free, you know?",
        "Reva: No, no, no, no...",
        "Josh: And I'm partially responsible.",
        "Reva: No, no, no. She wanted to tell me something.",
        "Josh: What? What could it be? It's out. It's not a secret anymore.",
        "Reva: I don't know. I don't know, but something. It was something... something else. Something... something only she knows.",
        "Marah: Jeffrey, I'm not going to run from what I did, all right? I'm not letting my father take the blame for what I did.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, god, marah, for the last time.",
        "Marah: Look, jeffrey, i killed someone. Okay, even you can't make that go away. God, I wish somebody could.",
        "Jeffrey: (Sighs) so, this never happened.",
        "Marah: But that cop saw us together.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm talking about you and I. We never happened.",
        "Marah: Now whose mind is playing tricks with him? Is it wishful thinking? Guilt?",
        "Jeffrey: I want you... I want you to have that bright future that I was talking about. Okay? And if we're seen together, the odds of that happening are not very good, so the solution is simple: We can't be seen together anymore.",
        "Marah: As easy as that?",
        "Jeffrey: It's for your own good.",
        "Marah: And you're the authority on that?",
        "Jeffrey: (Sighs) your folks are waiting.",
        "Danny: You could have been killed, michelle.",
        "Michelle: I know. I know that, danny. And now you know why I kept this...",
        "Danny: I just... I can't believe this has been going on. Of course... of course!",
        "Michelle: What?",
        "Danny: The gas leak in the fireplace. It had to be her. I knew it was tampered with.",
        "Michelle: I thought it was carrie at first, you know, because she said she was here that night, but...",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Michelle: Yes.",
        "Danny: She... michelle!",
        "Michelle: She said she was the one who turned the gas off.",
        "Danny: Right, right. Sure, michelle. Why didn't you tell me about this? Why?",
        "Michelle: Danny, I wanted to. I wanted to so many times. Please, please don't be angry with me. Please.",
        "Danny: Oh, no, don't tell me to not be angry with you. (Sighs) I'll be okay, I'll be fine.",
        "Michelle: You know, I never completely believed you, all those times that you told me that lying to me was the hardest thing you ever had to do. And now I know.",
        "Danny: You obviously did what you thought was best.",
        "Michelle: What is this going to cost us, though? I mean, your campaign. Our relationship.",
        "Danny: Don'T. Michelle, don'T. Don'T. Don't go there. It's not worth it. Don'T.",
        "Michelle: We have so many good things going for us, and I've totally put it all in jeopardy. One newspaper article about the candidate's wife at a scene of a fatal crime-- that could wreak havoc on your entire campaign. It's going to ruin everything that you worked so hard for, and what's that going to do to us?",
        "Danny: You're not listening to me. Michelle! I don't care about the campaign. I don'T... you are much more important to me than some dumb election.",
        "Michelle: I know that, but i think this could cause you a lot of trouble.",
        "Danny: No, michelle. Trouble is something happening to you, or to robbie. That's trouble. Don't you understand? I would give up everything-- the campaign, fifth street, whatever-- I would give it up to keep you safe.",
        "Michelle: I know you're angry at me.",
        "Danny: Of course I'm angry. You should have told me about this. When I think that you could have been hurt, or worse? Look, the important thing is that I know now and whatever there is to deal with, you won't have to deal with it alone, okay?",
        "Michelle: Thank you. And thank you for reminding me why I love you.",
        "Danny: What about the envelope? You said that that's the same stationery she used to contact your father and the others.",
        "Michelle: Yeah. God, what if this means she's still alive?",
        "Danny: Well, michelle, i think you need to open it and find out.",
        "Alexandra: Alan, are you going to take this deal?",
        "Alan: Yes, I am. And I want you to go to europe as soon as possible.",
        "Alexandra: You really think this is going to be that serious that you're giving me a heads- up?",
        "Alan: Yes. I am giving you some brotherly advice. I want to try and protect you from the fallout of what might happen in this investigation.",
        "Alexandra: Because you're tired of hurting your family.",
        "Alan: Yes. And I think the irony has something to do with it, also. And my guilt.",
        "Alexandra: I really don't understand.",
        "Alan: You drugged me, took away my business, tried to take away my life. I drugged maryanne and took away her life. It's only fitting that I should have suffered all these years. So many times, I wish that...",
        "Alexandra: I know, I know, i know. You wish that you were the one who hadn't surfaced, huh? It's okay.",
        "Alan: It would have been the fairest thing, but that's not what happened.",
        "Alexandra: We've both been so lonely, haven't we?",
        "Alan: I know you have. I've been lonely, too, alexandra.",
        "Alexandra: Well, when are you going to talk to o'neill?",
        "Alan: Soon. And I think you should go to paris immediately.",
        "Alexandra: I honestly have never seen you like this.",
        "Alan: Well, feast your eyes and get on a plane as soon as possible.",
        "Reva: Sweetie.",
        "Marah: Everything's going to be okay.",
        "Josh: We'll make sure of that, darling.",
        "Ross: Jeffrey! Jeffrey, I want to know everything that marah said to you.",
        "Jeffrey: Hello, ross.",
        "Ross: Hello.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, first of all, if you're worried that I somehow coaxed a confession out of your client, you can relax, okay? Marah asked for a lawyer right off the bat, so my hands were tied.",
        "Ross: And that's all that was said?",
        "Jeffrey: Anything that she might have said without her lawyer present is inadmissible, so that point's moot, you know? Besides, this case has become clear to me without marah saying anything.",
        "Ross: So, how do you see it?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I see that caroline caruthers lured those people to a deserted area with the specific intention of ambushing them. She was armed and she had motive.",
        "Ross: So, whoever shot caruthers did it as an act of self-defense or defense of others?",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, I believe that.",
        "Ross: So then there's a chance that you might not file charges against marah, is that correct?",
        "Jeffrey: I'll have to wait for the final police report to come in, ross, you know. In the meantime, this detective is going to be taking her statement, so you might as well get in there and make sure everything's on the up-and-up. If there's nothing else?",
        "Ross: Not at the moment, thank you. T(",
        "Frank: O'neill, what's josh doing in there? I told you you were not to question him unless I was here.",

        "Josh: How could a good man have possibly walked away from that riverbank and then kept this secret for almost 30 years, reva?",
        "Reva: You were young, and from what I understand, you were following the leader. What all of you did was wrong, but I know you're a good man, joshua. You raised two great kids and you brought more joy into this world than you have pain. Does that erase what you did? No. But it's got to count for something. It has to.",

        "Alan: That's because we're family and we will always be family. But remember, I think you should look at it this way: You're going to be treated like a queen and live like a queen in paris, and no one will be looking over your shoulder.",
        "Alexandra: You know it's never that easy, alan.",
        "Alan: Yes, I know, I know, but I think it's the best thing to do. Now, the decision is up to you but I am going to come clean. You do what you have to do. And for the record, I love you, too.",

        "Danny: That's not good.",
        "Michelle: No, it's very bad. But now that you know everything, I'm not afraid anymore. To be afraid as long as I'm around, because I will never, never let anything happen to you. Ever. Okay? Come here.",
