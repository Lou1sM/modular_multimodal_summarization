        "Alan and Gus argue in the cabin over everything from Alan as a father to whether or not Gus is going to take a pill to make him feel better. When Gus doesn't think that Alan is looking, takes the pill. Harley questions Beth about the key she found and when her heart rate spikes at the questions tells Mallet that she knows something about Gus. Dinah tells Beth that she will have a place at the Spaulding mansion for as long as she is in charge. As Beth \"escapes\" from the hospital, Dinah, Harley, and Mallet all follow her. Cassie runs into Josh and Reva at Company and blames Reva for the fact that Jonathan and Tammy may be married and that they are missing. Reva points out that Cassie was the one who pushed Tammy away. When Cassie admits that she and Jeffrey are \"taking a break\", Josh admits he had something to do with their problems. He later tells Reva that her little speech on destiny before her accident may be true since the day of her accident he took a different way home which is how he came upon the crash site to save her. Jonathan comes back to find out that Tammy left the room where he made her promise to stay. He is disheveled and Tammy worries about what he has done. He tells her that he just ran to get his anger over seeing her in a wedding dress with Sandy out of his mind. They pledge their own private vows to each other and then make love."

        "Reva: Okay, you got me here. Your job is over.",
        "Josh: Really? What if I'm hungry, what if I want to stay here and have a bite to eat.",
        "Reva: Josh, you're only doing this out of some sense of responsibility.",
        "Josh: Yeah, says who?",
        "Reva: Says me. You've been hovering since the accident.",
        "Josh: Well, some things have changed since the accident, Reva?",
        "Cassie: Have either of you heard from Jonathan?",
        "Reva: Not since yesterday. He called and asked us to some special event he was planning. He was supposed to call back, and say when/where, but he never did.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I think that event was a wedding-- his and Tammy's.",
        "Josh: What? Are you sure about that?",
        "Cassie: Everything points to it, Josh. I don't know, I talked to Sandy, he says they weren't married, but who the hell knows.",
        "Josh: And Sandy hasn't seen either one of them since yesterday?",
        "Cassie: No. And Tammy left in the worst way yesterday. Now they're both gone and who knows if they're even coming back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Jonathan? ( Sighs )",
        "Jonathan: Sandy's not chasing us out of town. I'm not letting him do that to us.",
        "Tammy: You heard him; he said he's not going to give up.",
        "Jonathan: We're going to play by my games, not his.",
        "Tammy: I just don't want anyone to get hurt.",
        "Jonathan: Sometimes that can't be helped.",
        "Tammy: Oh, God. Please be okay. Jonathan? Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you.",
        "Jonathan: You went out?",
        "Tammy: I was worried.",
        "Jonathan: I told you to stay inside and keep the door locked.",
        "Tammy: That's all you have to say after being gone for--",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: This is a very bad idea. Hey, it's me.",
        "Mallet: Where are you?",
        "Harley: I'm in E.R. And I'm staring at Beth. My gut tells me she is hiding something. She knows something important about Gus, I know it.",
        "Mallet: I'll come down there.",
        "Harley: No, don't come down;, I just want to talk to you.",
        "Mallet: I'll be there in a few minutes.",
        "Harley: All right, I'll see you in a few minutes.",
        "Dinah: Let me guess, you have a police emergency?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, yeah, Harley needs my help.",
        "Dinah: I thought we talked about Harley kind of working things out on her own from now own?",
        "Mallet: Well, she sounds kind of lost right now. And the problem is if I pitched in, I don't know if I'd be making things worse for her.",
        "Dinah: And us.",
        "Gus: ( Coughs )",
        "Alan: Gus?",
        "Gus: What, what?",
        "Alan: Nothing. I just had a bad dream.",
        "Gus: Is it the one where you're all tied up and left to die? Because I had the same one, buddy.",
        "Alan: She won't leave us here. She'll be back.",
        "Gus: Did you hear that?",
        "Alan: I don't hear anything.",
        "Gus: Exactly. Because the furnace quit.",
        "Alan: She won't let this happen to us. She's not that cold-blooded.",
        "Gus: I don't really think we're going to live long enough to find out. And right now, my money is on the pissed off blonde.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Hey, how's she doing?",
        "Rick: She's doing great. The meds have kicked in; she's getting some really good rest.",
        "Harley: How's the baby doing? Everything okay with the baby?",
        "Rick: Well, except the whole Alan being the father thing, that sickens me. You know, what can you do?",
        "Beth: ( Gasps )",
        "Rick: Oh. Hey, take it easy.",
        "Beth: Alan--",
        "Rick: Take it easy.",
        "Beth: Harley, you're still here?",
        "Rick: Let me get you some water, sweetie; I'll be right back.",
        "Harley: I wanted to return something to you, Beth. You dropped this when you fainted at Company. Yeah, it says Homestead Hills, right? It says Homestead Hills. Mm-hmm. It doesn't ring a bell to me. What is it? Where is it? (Heart monitor beating faster )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Actually, I think I might be making two major mistakes here.",
        "Dinah: One being?",
        "Mallet: Passing up dinner with you, obviously.",
        "Dinah: Oh, yes, yes, yes. And what's the second?",
        "Mallet: Setting up for another big fall.",
        "Dinah: How so?",
        "Mallet: Well, Harley thinks Beth is acting strange. And she has, she's been squirrelly as hell, and that's making Harley suspicious.",
        "Dinah: I wonder why. Does it have anything to do with Gus?",
        "Mallet: Well, she doesn't know anything, but it turns out that Beth is pregnant.",
        "Dinah: What? With Alan's baby? Oh, my gosh. No wonder she has been acting so freaky lately. Okay, let's get to the hospital. Come on.",
        "Mallet: Are you... you're not? Dinah you're not .I'm going to miss out on dinner anyway. Besides, I need to speak to Beth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Beth, what's going on?",
        "Beth: Nothing.",
        "Rick: Are you okay? Your heart rate's spiking.",
        "Beth: I'm fine. I'm fine.",
        "Rick: Harley, I think it's best for you to step outside, let her calm down for a little bit.",
        "Harley: Oh, sure. You know what? Why don't I just hang on to this for you--",
        "Beth: No, that's okay, I'll take it and put it with my things.",
        "Harley: Homestead Hills, right? Why would you hold onto that thing now?",
        "Beth: Obviously, I forgot to return it.",
        "Rick: This inquisition is not helping, okay, so...",
        "Harley: No problem. No problem. I'll be waiting in the hall.",
        "Rick: She's an emotional wreck, all right? So, you need to give her some time to relax and rest.",
        "Harley: She has been through a lot.",
        "Rick: Please.",
        "Harley: Probably more than she can say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: ( Coughing )",
        "Alan: There's a pill left. Here, take this pill.",
        "Gus: I don't need a pill. Pain is good. It reminds--",
        "Alan: It will remove the pain and help you think straight, come on.",
        "Gus: No. I want to think like this. I don't want to freeze-- keep my mind off freezing.",
        "Alan: Gus, there are no heroes here. Come on, take this pill.",
        "Gus: I want to stay alive.",
        "Alan: I'm trying to help you stay alive. Don't you understand. Take this.",
        "Gus: You don't care if I live or die. You probably hope I die so you can take my blanket from me.",
        "Alan: Do you really think that I would do that to you?",
        "Gus: Do that to me? You've done a worse. You'd take the shirt off my back.",
        "Alan: To hell with you. To hell with me for even caring.",
        "Gus: Cry me a river. Cry me a river!",
        "Josh: I'll make some phone calls and see if I can't track them down.",
        "Cassie: So, is this what you wanted?",
        "Reva: I'm sorry. Hi, sis, how are you doing? What are you talking about?",
        "Cassie: For the happy couple. Is this how you saw it ending up, with Jonathan and Tammy running off disappearing-- maybe getting married, maybe not.",
        "Reva: Okay, so this is my fault? I didn't want them to run off together. You are the one who contributed to this scenario.",
        "Cassie: Me?",
        "Reva: Yes, you. Jonathan didn't run away with Tammy; you pushed her away with both hands.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, well, maybe I did, but at least I was trying to protect her. In the end, she's going see that, but in the meantime, God only knows what Jonathan has gotten her into now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: This thing's history.",
        "Tammy: I still want to know where you've been.",
        "Jonathan: I'll tell if you will.",
        "Tammy: You went after Sandy, didn't you?",
        "Jonathan: Uh-huh.",
        "Tammy: God, what did you do?",
        "Jonathan: Nothing. I couldn't find him. He wasn't at his place, and he wasn't at the gym; he wasn't at the fishing shack. I don't know.",
        "Tammy: Come here. How did you get so messed up?",
        "Jonathan: I was driving around looking for him, and I kept flashing back to busting in on you two in the fishing shack. With you in the wedding dress, and him standing over you in that tux. I don't know, it's like burned in the back of my eyes, and it flipped me out enough I just swerved and went into a ditch.",
        "Tammy: That's how you ended up like this?",
        "Jonathan: No. I just took off running through the woods. Woods-- the world's biggest briar patch. That's...",
        "Tammy: I don't care what happened out there-- what you did or where you went-- as long as you're here now. That's all that matters now. Nothing else matters.",
        "Jonathan: Say that again.",
        "Tammy: Nothing else matters, Jonathan, not when we're together.",
        "Jonathan: That's what I was thinking the whole time. I couldn't wait to be back with you again.",
        "Tammy: You know what I wish?",
        "Jonathan: What?",
        "Tammy: We could be together forever.",
        "Jonathan: We can now, Tammy. We can do that, because there's nothing stopping us anymore.",
        "Tammy: Are you saying you want to make this official, make us official?",
        "Jonathan: Official between me and you?",
        "Tammy: I thought you were going to ask me to marry you yesterday.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I know.",
        "Tammy: That's why I went to the fishing shack and put on that dress. I was all set to--",
        "Jonathan: What, have another big show of a wedding?",
        "Tammy: Oh, you think I'm crazy.",
        "Jonathan: No, I don't. I think that you're sweet and that you still have hope, and you just want everything to be right and to look right. But... hey, what we have-- what we've had all along, it's.. well it's private. Almost like a secret.",
        "Tammy: It's ours.",
        "Jonathan: It's ours. And it has nothing to do with what's legal or right. It has nothing to do with what anyone else expects of us. It's between me and you.",
        "Tammy: Me and you. Nothing else matters.",
        "Jonathan: I remember when we first got together, I said \"no promises,\" but now I'd like to change that. We could have our own private vows.",
        "Tammy: Let me go first, please. I, Tammy Winslow, take you, Jonathan Randall, to be my soul mate, my friend, my other half for life. What I am, whatever I hope to be, I share it with to you, I give it to you. Because I know who you are, and I know what you would do for me, and I love you for that. And I love you for everything else about you. There is nothing that could make me not love you, Jonathan. That's my promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I've got to go find my daughter.",
        "Reva: You make it sound like she has been tied to a set railroad tracks.",
        "Cassie: Well, she is in danger, Reva?",
        "Reva: Because she might marry Jonathan?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, and not just that.",
        "Reva: What?",
        "Cassie: Sandy. He has ignored the restraining order to keep away from her. It's only a matter of time before he and Jonathan have at it. And when that happens, it can only end badly.",
        "Reva: Now, you don't know that for sure. Just--",
        "Cassie: We're not talking about two calm, rational guys here. What do you think is going to happen if Sandy insists that he takes Tammy away from Jonathan? And who gets caught in the middle? Tammy. Except I'm not going to let that happen.",
        "Reva: Does Jeffrey really think that Sandy's that much of a threat?",
        "Cassie: I don't know.",
        "Reva: What do you mean, you don't know?",
        "Cassie: We're taking a break. He moved out.",
        "Reva: Oh, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: But don't... don't stop being mad at me out of pity. Whatever is going to happen with Jeffrey, I will get through it.",
        "Reva: But I don't understand. What happened to make it turn out this way?",
        "Josh: Ah, that would be me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: ( Groans ) I don't think we're going to get out of here.",
        "Gus: Don't give up yet, because I'm going to get up in a minute. I'm going to get up in a minute.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Hey.",
        "Harley: Hi, guys.",
        "Dinah: How are you?",
        "Harley: Hanging in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Rick.",
        "Rick: What?",
        "Beth: I've got to get out of here.",
        "Rick: I'd like to keep you another night, just to be on the safe side. Can you bear to be with me that long?",
        "Beth: Fine.",
        "Rick: Okay.",
        "Beth: Hey, Rick, these antibiotics you have given me, are they okay for the baby?",
        "Rick: Absolutely. Just... Beth, try to get some rest. I'm going to get you another room, but don't be a naughty girl and try to run away, okay?",
        "Beth: I have got to get out of here.",
        "Dinah: Beth, I'm glad you're awake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: I know you think I'm crazy and that my antenna going on about Beth is some by-product of grief, or paranoia, or some other lost thing I'm sure life will throw at me, and that Beth has every reason to be pale, shaky and nervous, because she's sick and she's pregnant and she's morning the lost of the man who fathered that rosemary's baby in there.",
        "Mallet: Oh, my God, you're twisting in the wind.",
        "Harley: You're the objective, rational one who's behaving like a cop and I'm the lunatic who's lost all perspective, I know it.",
        "Mallet: Are you finished?",
        "Harley: Lunatic, objective. Yeah, I'm finished.",
        "Mallet: Okay, good. Because I was going to say I kind of agree with you.",
        "Harley: Oh, you do?",
        "Mallet: Well, listen, I found a little interesting fact today, a little tidbit.",
        "Harley: What, what?",
        "Mallet: Alan Spaulding filed for divorce, and guess when wife Beth received the papers? The night Alan and Gus disappeared.",
        "Harley: And she's my best friend and she doesn't even tell me this?",
        "Mallet: Geez, what a surprise.",
        "Harley: I am so on to that woman. She knows something. I don't care if she's sick, I don't care of she's pregnant, I am going in there and I'm going to shake loose some answers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie Gatschet, \"Inside The Light.\" I grew up in Philly-- filthy-Delphia as we like to call it. Got a lot of pride in Philadelphia. My mom and I are like this. My mom is my best friend in the whole world. We're really lucky that we're extremely close-- just like Tammy and Cassie are extremely close because they've been through a lot together. My mom and I have been through a lot and we just are like the best friends in the world. See Tammy, Wednesday, March 15, \"Inside The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Where are you going? You're not going in there with me.",
        "Mallet: We both have questions; we go get answers.",
        "Harley: I said I was going to do this alone. What part of that did you not understand?",
        "Mallet: Okay. Okay. Then at least get me up to speed. You said you found something?",
        "Harley: I picked up a key that Beth dropped, when she fainted at Company. And when I showed it to her, her heart monitor went through the roof.",
        "Mallet: What is the key to?",
        "Harley: A room at a spa she's was visiting, Homestead Hills.",
        "Mallet: Homestead Hills, I've never heard of it, but then again, I'm not a spa regular.",
        "Harley: No, neither am I. What are you doing?",
        "Mallet: I'm writing it down, Homestead Hills. I'm going to have my boys check it out.",
        "Harley: Mallet, I told you we're not working on this together.",
        "Mallet: I let you know what I find out.",
        "Harley: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: I'm really tired and I wasn't expecting visitors.",
        "Dinah: I won't stay long. I just came to reassure you.",
        "Beth: About what?",
        "Dinah: That you and your children can stay in your home as long as you would like if I have any say in the matter.",
        "Beth: What?",
        "Dinah: I'm sure that you know technically the CEO of Spaulding has complete over your home, but you and your children have made it yours, and I am not interested in living there. And now that you have another child on the way--",
        "Beth: Wow, news travels fast, doesn't it?",
        "Dinah: So, if there is anything that you need, I will make sure it happens.",
        "Beth: You want to help me, Dinah?",
        "Dinah: That's why I came.",
        "Beth: Because I need to get out of this hospital tonight.",
        "Dinah: Beth, you have pneumonia and your pregnant. You don't need to be getting up out of anywhere.",
        "Beth: So, you're not going to help me.",
        "Dinah: I just think you should be thinking of the baby. I don't think I should be reminding you of that.",
        "Beth: I would put my life on the line for this baby. That's why I need to get out of here, so I can be a good mother.",
        "Dinah: I don't understand.",
        "Beth: I don't have time to explain. I just need to get out of here!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Homestead Hills. Doesn't exist; no such place.",
        "Harley: Well that key unlocks something.",
        "Mallet: Mm-hmm, something she doesn't want anyone to find out about, considering how worked up she got when you showed her the key. You know, she kind of got freaked out by the victim that came in that was killed by his wife. You add in the fact that Alan Spaulding served her divorce papers completely out of the blue, and that would make Beth one angry wife.",
        "Harley: Do you think she could've killed Alan?",
        "Mallet: Why one would say that she has the motive.",
        "Harley: Alan and Gus were together the night they night they disappeared.",
        "Mallet: Don't jump to conclusions.",
        "Harley: I'm not jumping to anything. I am trying to put the pieces together; the same pieces you are putting together.",
        "Mallet: You are trying to draw a link between her and Gus, and we don't have the whole story, do we?",
        "Harley: Let's go and in ask her. Shall we? Mallet, just stay out of my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: My family hates me. Everyone, with the exception of Elizabeth.",
        "Gus: Save your... save your energy.",
        "Alan: Alan-Michael betrayed me the minute I brought him back to town. He'll never forget me for side-stepping him in the will. And Phillip's gone and you don't care anything about me. I've been a horrible father. I wish I had another chance. I made a lot of mistakes. I'll never be able to go back. And correct them. Never again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Why are you blaming yourself for Cassie and Jeffrey's problems?",
        "Cassie: It isn't Josh's fault. It got to point where I couldn't look at Jeffrey without seeing him in Richard's uniform, taking a glass of wine out my hand and leading me to the bed.",
        "Reva: To the bed?",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Reva: And how do you fit into all of this?",
        "Josh: A few months ago I went to Cassie with information about Jeffrey's past.",
        "Reva: In San Cristobel? Information-- and you acquired this information how? Where did you get it?",
        "Josh: That's not really important, Reva. The point is that I'm the one who started this whole thing.",
        "Cassie: That's not true.",
        "Josh: It is.",
        "Cassie: I didn't even look at the file, I refused it.",
        "Josh: But the whole thing got rolling because of me.",
        "Cassie: Well, I would rather have the truth come out rather than living a lie.",
        "Reva: What happens now?",
        "Cassie: I don't know. Maybe we work it out, and maybe we don't.",
        "Reva: I have faith in you.",
        "Cassie: Thanks. I wish that was enough. Things happen, relationships fail or get cut short, even when you think they're going to last forever.",
        "Josh: This one is not over yet, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: We'll see. It's funny, you know, when you believe that destiny brought you together with someone, you never think you're going to be apart. You think this is it, this is forever. I guess life doesn't always work out that way, does it?",
        "Reva: Sometimes it does.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: I, Jonathan Randall... ( laughs ) I can't -- I can't do it like this. I just have to just say what comes out.",
        "Tammy: I'm listening.",
        "Jonathan: That's one of the things I love about you, you're always listening.",
        "Tammy: I'll do that for the rest of our lives.",
