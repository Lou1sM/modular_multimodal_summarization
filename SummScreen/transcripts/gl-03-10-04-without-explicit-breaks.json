        "Marah has spent the night at Reva's house but wants to get on with her life despite the charges she could be facing. Reva and Josh reach a compromise with her; she'll live in the pool house. Shayne remains quiet, upset about what's going on. Marah heads to the Museum to pack her things and runs into Marina. Marah confesses that she was the shooter and urges Marina to tell Shayne. Jeffrey is accosted by a reporter who wants to know about the mysterious new suspect. Jeffrey, going even farther out on the limb to protect Marah, threatens the reporter. He then meets with Billy, Ed and Buzz and informs them that Marah has come forward. He needs them to change their stories and tell the truth. Cassie and Edmund show up to support Reva. When Reva tells Cassie how hard Jeffrey is working to help Marah, Cassie starts to feel guilty. She wants to call Jeffrey and apologize but Edmund stops her, warning her that it will only result in a fight. But later, Edmund sees Cassie leaving a message for Jeffrey. Shayne finally admits to Josh he's angry that no one told him what was going on. Josh says Shayne helped enormously just by inspiring the whole family to fight on. Marina arrives and Shayne confronts her about lying to him. Marina says she kept quiet because she wanted her wish that she made on Carrie's ring to come true. Alex, conflicted over Alan's offer, pays Buzz a visit. He admits that he almost left town when things got bad. But he's glad he stuck it out and promises to spend more time with Alex."

        "Cassie: Not one word of marah's confession.",
        "Edmund: Thank god.",
        "Cassie: No, thank god that they let josh and reva take her home last night. I mean the thought of marah in jail.",
        "Edmund: How are you holding up?",
        "Cassie: I'm fine. You know, it's marah to be concerned about. We have to get over to reva'S. I just got off the phone with her and we have to go...",
        "Edmund: Why don't you go without me, cassie?",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Edmund: I have time imagining the lewises ever need to see my face.",
        "Cassie: Well, maybe I need you. And I think you could help, edmund. I do.",
        "Edmund: How?",
        "Cassie: Well, you're no stranger to scandal. And if everything blows up, which I'm sure is bound to happen.",
        "Edmund: Oh, you need a spin doctor.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. I need you there to hold my hand. And I also need you there to hold me back if jeffrey o'neill decides to press charges against marah.",
        "Reva: Marah's still sleeping.",
        "Josh: Well, at least she's catching up on her sleep. That's a good thing. Shayne. Son, you've hardly said anything since we've told you last night. I know it's a lot for you to take in.",
        "Shayne: Mom, I can handle it. It's marah, we need to worry about now.",
        "Marah: Hey. There you are. Good morning.",
        "Reva: Hi.",
        "Marah: Sorry it's late.",
        "Reva: Oh, no, I'm glad you're finally getting some sleep. It's breakfast time. And I actually picked up some of those low fat, no flavor muffins that you like. And there's coffee.",
        "Marah: Thanks. But I should be getting back to the museum.",
        "Josh: Why don't you stay with us for awhile? Let us take care of you.",
        "Marah: Dad, I'm not a little girl. I can't just hide out here forever.",
        "Reva: Okay, if you don't want to be a little girl in your little girl room then I have a suggestion. How about you move into the pool house? You'll have your privacy and we'll be right next door in case you need us.",
        "Marah: Sure. Sure. That sounds good. But I still want to pick up a few things before...",
        "Shayne: I'll go with you.",
        "Marah: That's okay. I'd just like to drive for a little while... alone. I'll be back soon, okay?",
        "Josh: The calm before the storm.",
        "Shayne: What's that suppose to mean?",
        "Reva: That we have to take advantage of these quiet times that we have. Jeffrey o'neill's protected marah so far,m and kept her name out of the papers.",
        "Josh: He's not going to be able to protect her forever.",
        "Reporter: Mr. O'neill?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, that's me.",
        "Reporter: It's me, amy. Remember from the springfield mirror.",
        "Jeffrey: Hello, amy. Hello, springfield mirror. Yes, I remember.",
        "Reporter: I wanted to ask you some questions about the shooting at the old fairgrounds.",
        "Jeffrey: I already told you guys once, okay. Our office is going to make a statement when we have one to make.",
        "Billy: Josh will be here any second.",
        "Buzz: Did he tell you about the release?",
        "Billy: No, I didn't bug him for details. I figured I'd let him go home, say hi to his family, take a shower.",
        "Ed: Maybe o'neill bought the self defense, calling off the dogs.",
        "Billy: Keep dreaming, ed. Somebody has to.",
        "Reporter: But what about the new suspect? Why aren't you releasing the suspect's name?",
        "Jeffrey: You can't hear me? You can't hear what I'm telling you? I don't like to repeat myself. Do you like to repeat yourself? You know, can you respect that? I just told you something. Can you respect me? If you don't then your newspaper might lose it's respect at the da's office. Am I making myself clear?",
        "Reva: I am so glad you're here.",
        "Cassie: I wouldn't be anywhere else. I filled in edmund on what's going on.",
        "Edmund: I'm just dropping cassie off, reva, I don't have to stay. But if there's anything I could do, please let me know.",
        "Reva: Come in, edmund, please.",
        "Edmund: Thank you. I was thinking, reva, if marah wants to get away from all of this, the farm is a work in progress, but it's very peaceful there. And I'm sure we can keep the press at bay.",
        "Reva: Well, I appreciate that, but marah is dead set on facing this thing head on.",
        "Cassie: I wonder where she gets that from.",
        "Reva: Yeah, family curse.",
        "Cassie: I don't know. Maybe she wants to... are you okay?",
        "Reva: Yeah, I'm just in overdrive. My mind is racing. Cassie, remember when I told you about the visions I was having of that woman? I just realized that the woman is the same woman who died almost 30 years ago. Maryanne caruthers.",
        "Cassie: Does seeing her help you with this?",
        "Reva: I don't know. I'm still trying to put all the pieces together, but she's definitely reaching out to me. I think there's something she's trying to tell me about her death.",
        "Shayne: Why does everything got to be so hard? Everything.",
        "Josh: Shayne. Shayne. Look, son, I don't expect you to understand. I don't expect you to forgive me. Walking away from that accident was one of the biggest mistakes I've ever made in my life. But the fact is I did it.",
        "Shayne: You really think i care about something you did a million years ago?",
        "Josh: I don't know. I don't know what you're thinking right now.",
        "Shayne: I'm not judging you. I'm not. I... I wasn't even there, all right. And it seems like you've been beating yourself up pretty good about it.",
        "Josh: It's been a tough year for everybody.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, but you've should have told me. I mean people I care about most in this world, you, marah, marina, your lives were on the line and I didn't even know about it. I could have helped. I could have done something.",
        "Josh: No. You...",
        "Shayne: How could you keep me in the dark?",
        "Josh: You needed to be focused on your recovery.",
        "Shayne: I... I... I'm not a kid! Don't give me that! I'm a member of this family! Did you ever think that helping you might have helped me? Huh?",
        "Josh: I wanted to talk to you. I really did.",
        "Shayne: Well, why didn't you?",
        "Josh: Because I didn't want to drag you into this. I didn't want to drag you in it. Not you, not marah, and not your mom.",
        "Shayne: Well, that's not... that's not the way it worked out. You could have been killed. Marah, marina, they could have been killed. Marah, marina, they could have been killed. And now marah might go away to jail and there's not a damn thing I could do about it.",
        "Josh: You helped.",
        "Shayne: How! How?",
        "Josh: Whether you're aware of it or not, you helped, shayne. By walking again, by getting back on your feet again. Everything that you went through. You showed us, all of us what real strength is. You showed us how tough this family can be and that we can overcome anything that's put in our way. That's what you showed us and that's what we need to be focused on right now.",
        "Marina: What's going on? They released your dad?",
        "Michelle: The paper said there was another suspect. Marah?",
        "Marah: It was me. I shot carrie.",
        "Marina: Marah. Oh, my god.",
        "Michelle: Okay, my dad said that...",
        "Marah: I know. He was just trying to protect me. They all were. And my dad took the blame and buzz, and billy and ed, they all just backed him up. They wanted to keep us all out of it. When I finally remembered what happened I couldn't let my dad take the blame for what I did. So I told jeffrey o'neill. Carrie shot buzz and she was going to go after my father too. So I grabbed the gun and if i hadn't done anything she would have killed my father. And who knows maybe everybody else.",
        "Michelle: Oh, marah.",
        "Marina: This thing with carrie started like a game. And now...",
        "Marah: I killed someone.",
        "Michelle: You did what you had to do.",
        "Marina: We would have done the same thing. She had a gun, she was out of her mind.",
        "Michelle: So what happens now?",
        "Marah: Jeffrey says that he was going to help me.",
        "Michelle: Good. Good. That's good. I mean they're not going to bring charges on you.",
        "Marah: I don't know.",
        "Marina: I mean it was self defense. You didn't do anything wrong. They have to see that. They couldn't blame you for doing what you did.",
        "Marah: I just keep saying it over and over in my head. I took a life.",
        "Michelle: Marah, you can't do this to yourself.",
        "Marah: You know what? You need to go see shayne.",
        "Marina: Shayne...",
        "Marah: He is at our parents house. He knows. And he seemed pretty upset. So go, you guys, both of you. I'm fine.",
        "Michelle: I'm not leaving you here alone.",
        "Marah: No, I'm not going to be alone. I'm going to grab a few things and then I'm going back to my parents.",
        "Michelle: Then I'll wait for you and we could go together.",
        "Marah: No, it's okay, really. I think I just, I need a few minutes to myself. Nobody knows that you guys were involved. So you're out of this.",
        "Marina: Yeah, right.",
        "Michelle: We're never going to be out of it.",
        "Marina: We are right here by your side and we're not going anywhere. Got that?",
        "Jeffrey: Good morning, boys. (Both) good morning.",
        "Buzz: Can I get you anything?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, thanks. Some coffee, some answers.",
        "Billy: And I'm sure all of your questions have been asked and answered.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, maybe we're looking for the real answers this time.",
        "Ed: Next time I talk to you I'd like my lawyer present.",
        "Jeffrey: What's all the hostility? I just set your friend free, didn't I?",
        "Billy: Well, yeah, normally I'd be the first one to buy you breakfast, but somehow I think from the paper this morning it seems to me you're going to pin this on somebody else?",
        "Jeffrey: You haven't talked to josh yet, have you?",
        "Billy: No. And while we're waiting for him, why don't you tell us how you wised up and set him free.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, let's just say that josh is no longer a viable suspect.",
        "Billy: Exactly what does that mean?",
        "Jeffrey: That means that someone else, someone from your family, as matter of fact, came forward with a different version of the events of that night.",
        "Billy: What does he want, counselor?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I think that in light of the new information, it might be in everyone's best interest to go down to police headquarters and revisit the statements that they made and maybe make a few corrections wherever they think they might need to be made. And this time you want to make it clearer. Why you lied in the first place and why you're going to be honest now.",
        "Billy: And why in god's name would we do that?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, because the person who did the actual shooting is going to find herself in even deeper trouble if you don'T.",
        "Buzz: Why would you give us the heads up? I mean you're known around town as a guy who sort of plays it by the book.",
        "Jeffrey: Sometimes the book has to be revised.",
        "Josh: I guess... you know what? I have to go for a while. So I'll see you later.",
        "Marina: Josh, what you did for marah...",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Josh: Listen, you know what? Your grandfather would have done the same thing for you.",
        "Marina: I am so sorry. Keeping this from you is one of the hardest things I've ever done. You don't know how many times I've wanted to run to you and tell you everything and have you help me like you always do when I'm in trouble.",
        "Shayne: Don't worry about it. I was too weak to handle it.",
        "Marina: No. It's just that it was kind of complicated and...",
        "Shayne: Well, I think it was pretty easy. I think it was pretty simple. You didn't trust me.",
        "Marina: I trust you more than I trust anyone. You know that. There is no way you're going to understand this. I was so stupid, shayne. I believed her. Carrie, she had these rings, one for her, one each for me, marah, michelle. She said they could grant wishes.",
        "Shayne: What are you talking about? Like a fairy godmother? And you believed her? You're not usually that gullible.",
        "Marina: Yeah, well, I held out at first. But then yeah, I guess I just needed something to believe in. She said that if we told anyone about her, she wouldn't come back and she'd take the rings with her.",
        "Shayne: Look, marina. Come on, marina, she was out of her mind. How could you not see that?",
        "Marina: Because maybe I was out of my mind too. I needed some magic. I needed my wish to come true.",
        "Shayne: What?",
        "Marina: What? What? A wish? What wish? Marina, what wish could have been important for you to risk yourself? To risk your life?",
        "Marina: You. I wished that you would walk again.",
        "Reva: But this woman that i saw, this maryanne, it was different than the visions that I've been seeing.",
        "Cassie: What does josh think?",
        "Reva: Well, you know, it's like josh's worst nightmare come true. He's been spending so much time trying to escape from this... this insanity trying to keep it from touching us that it's all blown up in his face. And it's out of his hands now and into jeffrey o'neill'S.",
        "Cassie: Jeffery o'neill. Wow. Well, he's going to have a field day with this.",
        "Reva: No, no, surprise, surprise. It's because of jeffrey that marah's even home. He's the one who kept her name out of the headlines. He went out of his way to keep her from incriminating herself. He went to bat for her even at the risk of his own career.",
        "Cassie: Wow! I guess you never know what to expect from that guy, huh?",
        "Reva: I think he has real feelings for marah. But I also think he knows not to get into them. But he's the only one at this point who could help her. ( Knock at the door)",
        "Marah: Who is it?",
        "Sandy: Sandy. Marah.",
        "Marah: Hi.",
        "Sandy: Reva called. What the hell happened?",
        "Marah: I'm sure she gave you all the gory details, right?",
        "Sandy: Yeah.",
        "Marah: Good. So we don't have to go through the motions of how are you? How are you feeling? What happened?",
        "Sandy: No, I hate those questions. Along with people pretending to understand what you're going through.",
        "Marah: That's interesting. I think I finally understand what... how you felt. What you were going through when you first came to springfield, having to hold in such a huge secret, afraid of telling people the truth, afraid of how they would react. And the longer you hold in that secret...",
        "Sandy: The harder it is to actually tell the truth. Yeah, I know something about that.",
        "Marah: I think that's how it was for my dad, holding in all of those memories. I thought that I was making it better, but it didn'T.",
        "Sandy: Hey, when a lie becomes part of life you do anything to hold on to it.",
        "Marah: Yeah, but I didn't get that. You know, I just kept pushing him and he just kept closing off even more.",
        "Sandy: I'm sorry you had to handle this alone, marah.",
        "Marah: I had marina and michelle.",
        "Sandy: But not your family.",
        "Marah: No. No, I... I couldn'T. I just felt myself withdrawing from them, because every time i was around them I thought that they would know that I was keeping a secret from them.",
        "Sandy: Yeah, you feel like everyone knows and they can see right through you. They know what a phony you are.",
        "Marah: Sandy, I'm sorry. I had no idea what it was like for you when you first came to springfield. It must have felt so alone.",
        "Sandy: Yeah. It was tough living a lie. Probably the hardest thing I'll ever do. But it was one of my own making. And you didn't ask what happened to you, you know. And it wasn't even your lie. But you were hurt more than anyone else. And that's the part I can't stand.",
        "Billy: You know, I'm having a little trouble believing that you're acting out the goodness of your heart, o'neill. I mean this sounds like a trick to me. We all go down there and we change our stories, incriminate everybody involved...",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I guess you're going to have to trust me that I'm doing what's best for everyone involved.",
        "Buzz: Is that so?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah.",
        "Josh: He's telling the truth. If we want to help marah, we have to come clean right now on everything before this thing escalates any further.",
        "Jeffrey: Make it clear that you're making these new statements of your own volition when you go down there.",
        "Billy: All right, I'm in. This better not hurt that little girl in anyway whatsoever.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you don't have to worry about that.",
        "Billy: And these other statements we made, they just go away?",
        "Jeffrey: Just make it clear that marah lewis had no choice but to shoot caroline caruthers. oprah: I cannot believe I'm trying this on television.",
        "Jeffrey: Dr. Bauer, any word on that tox-screen you performed on marah lewis the other night?",
        "Ed: Oh, no, I'll call you when I get the results.",
        "Jeffrey: I'd appreciate that.",
        "Frank: There's something you want to talk to me about, dad?",
        "Buzz: I'd guess you'd like me to explain a few things?",
        "Frank: Save it. I got the basics down at the station. 30 years ago, you got a three- day pass. You came to springfield, but you decided to go a fair and have fun instead of visiting with your family. At the fair you met up with a bunch of guys, you picked up a girl, you went in a car and you went on a joyride. The girl got killed, things got complicated and you walked away. And then harley and I lost our father for half of our lives. Does that pretty sum it up, dad?",
        "Buzz: I was going to leave springfield anyway, frank. I guess that doesn't make it any better.",
        "Frank: Listen, I don't want to talk about it right now. As matter of fact I don't know if I ever want to talk about it. What's going on with o'neill. Why is he here?",
        "Buzz: Apparently you've been a good influence on him. He wants to help out marah anyway he can.",
        "Frank: Is that right? Well, so much for our remaining neutral. Right, o'neill?",
        "Marah: Everything just escalated. We were trying to protect our fathers, they were trying to protect us.",
        "Sandy: That's how it is with lies. They poison everything they touch and before you know it a secret can be deadly.",
        "Marah: I only kept a secret for a few months and it just felt awful. I don't even know how my dad did it for all of those years. When I first found out, I was so angry with him because I didn't understand how... how you just put it behind you and pretend like nothing ever happened.",
        "Sandy: I... (clears throat)... I don't think it works like that. I think you carry guilt like that with you everyday. And you try to make friends with the lie. You try to make it real, believable somehow. But there's always a voice in the back of your head saying \"you are a liar, a bad person. You should be found out and punished.\"",
        "Marah: I think that's why my dad took the blame for me because he felt like he should be punished for what he did. But I did it. And I couldn't let him...",
        "Sandy: Hey, you did... you did what you had to do. And you saved your dad's life. (Knock at the door)",
        "Reporter: Marah lewis? (Knocking continues)",
        "Sandy: What do you want?",
        "Reporter: We need a comment on her father's release. She was seen exiting the station. Did she see the other suspect?",
        "Sandy: Hold on. I got this. Just slip out the back.",
        "Marah: Sandy, it's okay. I'll deal with it.",
        "Sandy: No, it's okay. I'll catch up with you later. Let me handle it.",
        "Marah: Thank you.",
        "Sandy: I'm sandy. Marah's brother.",
        "Marina: (Crying)",
        "Shayne: Marina? Marina? Come on, marina, it wasn't some stupid ring that made me walk again. Stupid magic ring. The only magic that I had was you. You never let up even when i did.",
        "Marina: I knew you could get back on your feet again.",
        "Shayne: Even when I try to push you away?",
        "Marina: I just pushed harder. You're amazing.",
        "Shayne: I guess we proved we're a pretty good team.",
        "Cassie: No, I just, have to stop assuming the worst about jeffrey o'neill.",
        "Edmund: Well, you're just being protective of your niece, cassie. I wouldn't punish yourself over it.",
        "Cassie: But even when he shows his good side I can't have faith in him. Why is that?",
        "Edmund: The two of you don't get along. I wouldn't overthink it.",
        "Reva: Edmund's right.",
        "Cassie: I think you're right. I think that he has feelings for marah.",
        "Edmund: Well, if he does, then I'm sure he'll make this thing as easy as possible for her.",
        "Cassie: He's sticking his neck out for this family. I should call him. I should let him know that marah's family really appreciates his efforts.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, don'T.",
        "Cassie: Edmund, I just want to help marah. If getting along with jeffrey o'neill does that, then what's the big deal?",
        "Edmund: Well, you just have to be careful of these types of things. They can backfire and make nice with jeffrey o'neill, he may come back with one of his signature glib comments and the two of you will be at each other throats and that won't help marah. Won't help anyone.",
        "Cassie: Look, I don't think that that's going to happen.",
        "Edmund: Look, I think you've asked me to exert my good influence and that's exactly what I'm doing.",
        "Reva: Edmund's right again, cassie, really. Just let it go.",
        "Edmund: If you'd like, I can talk to jeffrey o'neill on your behalf.",
        "Cassie: Oh, and that's going to work.",
        "Marah: Hey, there are reporters camped out on the front lawn, so I had to come in the back way.",
        "Cassie: Hey there. How are you doing?",
        "Marah: Okay.",
        "Cassie: Look, if you need anything I really want you to call me, okay.",
        "Marah: How about a get-out- of-jail-free card?",
        "Jeffrey: I've used up all of mine.",
        "Marah: Thank you. All of you for your support. But I just... I just want to get some rest and get settled in the pool house.",
        "Cassie: All right, well, if you need anything, please call me.",
        "Marah: Thank you.",
        "Edmund: Good-night.",
        "Marah: Good-night.",
        "Reva: Edmund. A favor, please. Stick by your guns. Don't let cassie anywhere near jeffrey o'neill.",
        "Edmund: I'll do my best.",
        "Reva: Thanks. I'm so glad you're back home, even it is under these circumstances.",
        "Billy: How's our girl?",
        "Josh: Well, she's a whole lot braver than I was at her age.",
        "Billy: Let up, josh. I mean, you did try to do the right thing.",
        "Josh: I don't think I tried hard enough.",
        "Billy: Now, look, I could be pretty persuasive. I was the one who talked you into...",
        "Josh: You know what, billy? Don't do that, okay? Don't try to let me off the hook.",
        "Billy: We raised our kids to be better than us. Now that's not absolution. But it is something.",
        "Josh: I just hope that she doesn't end up paying the price for our sins.",
        "Alexandra: Well...",
        "Buzz: You know.",
        "Alexandra: Yeah.",
        "Buzz: Alan told you.",
        "Alexandra: He took the blame.",
        "Buzz: About 27 years too late.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, no, that's wrong. Everybody was at fault.",
        "Alexandra: Is that right?",
        "Buzz: You must be a little disappointed in me. I was walking around like I was better than alan, all the time...",
        "Alexandra: I love you both. I understand.",
        "Buzz: How could you?",
        "Alexandra: I just do. Well, aren't you glad you got someone like me around in a time like this?",
        "Buzz: A complicated most from a woman who knows and understands what it's like to fall off wagon and make a mistake you've never thought you'd make. Yeah, I'm glad. But I wouldn't blame you if walked away and never looked back.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, god, you just don't get it do you? You don't get it? I'm absolutely horrified of what happened. But you save your apologies for children, your grandchildren. You owe me no apology. You just let me help you. That will help me.",
        "Buzz: I'm lucky I have you.",
        "Alexandra: Yeah.",
        "Buzz: I need a place to go.",

        "Jeffrey: Just back off, frank, okay. I know what I'm doing.",
        "Frank: That's not what I saw. Jeffrey, you're the da...",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, which I have prosecutorial discretion, frank.",
        "Frank: Your first responsibility is to the law. You're getting too involved.",
        "Jeffrey: There are a lot of people involved here, aren't there? Need I remind you that your dad's head is on the block here, also.",
        "Frank: What? You don't think I know that?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, then why are you busting my chops over this?",
        "Frank: Because there's a lot of people that we care about and that we know that are involved. And you, you put up this big act, this big front like you don't care about anything, but you know what? This one's a little different. This one's tearing you up inside, and all you want to do is you want to help out, and extend your arm and help. But you can't cut any corners. You know why? Because if the attorney general gets wind of you doing anything not by the book...",
        "Jeffrey: Do you think I give a damn about the attorney general?",
        "Frank: Well, you better give a damn about the attorney general because if you don't follow everything by the book, i can't help you.",
        "Jeffrey: Listen to me. I am going to do what I have to do, okay? And if anybody doesn't like it-- if the attorney general doesn't like it-- he can fire me. I don't give a damn anymore.",
        "Cassie: Thank you so much for coming with me to reva'S.",
        "Edmund: I just wish there was something I could do to help marah.",
        "Cassie: You being there was help. I have to make a phone call really fast, okay?",
        "Edmund: Right.",
        "Cassie: I'll see you upstairs.",
        "Edmund: Good. Sarah? Hi. I'd like to make a reservation for two. You know, I didn't even check to see if cassie's available. One second.",
        "Cassie: Yes, I need to speak to jeffrey o'neill as soon as possible. Thank you.",
        "Reva: Why do I feel like I'm waiting on something? Maybe because I am. Waiting on a woman who's been dead almost 30 years. (Sighs) come on, maryanne. Tell me what it is you want me to know. (Knock at door) somehow I knew you'd show up here.",
        "Marina: Oh, marah. Sorry. We were just...",
        "Marah: Being happy together. I'm glad.",
        "Shayne: So, is there something else we can get you? Like some extra blankets? Maybe magazines or some food or something?",
        "Marah: No. No, I'm fine. I've got everything I need, thank you.",
        "Shayne: All right. Love you.",
        "Marah: I love you. Thank you.",
        "Shayne: We'll be in the house if you need us.",
        "Marah: Okay.",
        "Josh: Billy, do you remember that time we decided to take the kids up to cross creek? I think marah was maybe five or six years old.",
        "Billy: Oh, yeah, yeah.",
        "Josh: I was bound and determined to teach her how to fish on that trip. You remember that?",
        "Billy: Right, yeah. And marah was the first lewis in history to insist on throwing the fish back. (Laughs)",
        "Josh: We went out fishing one day and that big old storm hit.",
        "Billy: Oh, yeah. There were hailstones real big.",
        "Josh: Oh. It felt like they were the size of baseballs and marah was just so scared, you know? She'd never seen anything like that before. And so I had her curl up small, in this tiny little ball, you know, and I just put my whole body over her to protect her. I remember these things, it felt like rocks hitting me in my back and my head. But during the whole storm all i felt was calm, because I knew that I was protecting my little girl. See, back then in that moment, i was... I was enough to keep her safe. But I'm not anymore, not now. I'm not... I'm not enough.",
        "Shayne: Next, on \"guiding light.\"",
        "Jeffrey: You okay?",
        "Marah: You don't need to worry about me. I'm fine.",
        "Jeffrey: Did it ever occur to you that I might not be?",
        "Reva: Are you sure?",
        "Josh: Yeah, I'm sure."
