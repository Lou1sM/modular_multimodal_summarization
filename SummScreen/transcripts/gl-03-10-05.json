A few more minutes and we'll know if this guy's for real.", "Frank: Okay, are we ready? State your full name and address.", "Webster: Jack douglas webster. 311 front street.", "Harley: To think that I was this close to pleading guilty and just going to prison. And now that may all change if... if this guy is telling the truth.", "Gus: You think...", "Harley: I mean, obviously if he's not, I...", "Gus: One step at a time.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: Um, are those what i think they are? Are these the keys to this apartment?", "Marina: Yes. And the lease. All you have to do is sign it.", "Danny: Uh, what... okay, wait. What's going on, here? First you find me a place to live, and now you arrange it so that I have absolutely no choice but to move in? Do I sense an agenda here?", "Marina: Oh, look, santos, an apartment with a view like this one comes along, like, never, okay? There was no way I wasn't going to jump on it. We just need to sign this and get it back there before it's too late.", "Danny: You know what? You would make a fantastic real estate agent. Let's go.", "Marina: ( Laughs )", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tony: Hey.", "Danny: Hey.", "Michelle: Hi.", "Danny: No time. Got to go.", "Tony: Okay. So, well, things are moving pretty quickly there. You okay with that? Hm?", "Michelle: Are you kidding? That's great.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: I need your help.", "Alexandra: Oh. Well, only if you'll help me decide what I'm going to have for dessert.", "Olivia: I don't have time for this. You were there when alan threatened to rip my life apart, alexandra. He's starting to make good on it.", "Alexandra: What?", "Olivia: He's using sebastian to go after bill.", "Alexandra: What makes you so sure?", "Olivia: Bill ended up in the emergency room. And I know this is just the beginning. I know it. I can feel it. He's going to try and take emma away from me.", "Alexandra: Or you away from her.", "Olivia: Why? Why is he doing this?", "Alexandra: He's lost phillip and not a thing he can do will bring him back, so all he has right now is his grandchildren. There's lizzie and james and zach...", "Olivia: And emma.", "Alexandra: Yes. And those children are his entire world. They're what he cares most about. I mean, that's what motivates every single move he's making.", "Olivia: Like trying to annihilate me.", "Alexandra: If he thinks there's any jeopardy to those children, from anyone...", "Olivia: How could I put my own daughter in jeopardy?", "Alexandra: Well, in alan's mind, maybe you're phillip's murderer. And he would never allow a granddaughter of his to be raised by his son's killer.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: Well, zach, look who's out here. It's your sister, standing out here in the cold because...", "Lizzie: Because I'm waiting for someone.", "Alan: Oh?", "Lizzie: And no, it's not coop.", "Alan: Well, his family is probably dancing on tabletops, celebrating their surprise witness.", "Lizzie: I don't know. I haven't been inside yet. But I know harley and gus went down to the police station.", "Alan: Yes. Probably to gloat.", "Lizzie: Do you really think this witness can clear harley?", "Alan: The courtroom isn't the only place where justice can be distributed.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Look a the needles. They're not even twitching. This guy's telling the truth.", "Frank: ...You saw a woman matching the description of...", "Harley: Yeah, but there's no pressure in there right now. You know? What happens when he's testifying on the stand? Jeffrey is going to do everything he can to make this guy crack. I... I think I should check him out.", "Gus: No. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Coop.", "Harley: I've got a question for you.", "Frank: Harley, you can't be in here.", "Harley: Did you make up a big, fat lie so you could cut a sweetheart deal with the da?", "Frank: Sis!", "Harley: Answer me!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Coop: You waved?", "Lizzie: I need to speak to you.", "Coop: Not alone, I take it.", "Lizzie: Oh. Right. Have you met my friend, tyler? He graduated top of his class at westlake prep. Now he's over at state for business. He's got his own business. It's doing great.", "Coop: That's great.", "Tyler: That's the word for it.", "Coop: Lizzie, I wanted to talk to you, too.", "Lizzie: Okay, well, I'm the boss, so I'm going to go first. When I walked in here, there were two tables that weren't set. The bussing tray needed to be emptied and the bathrooms were disgusting. We cannot have that around here.", "Coop: We also can't have people parking in the handicapped spots without permits.", "Tyler: Oh, yeah. That would be me. I'm not staying long.", "Coop: You're certainly not handicapped yet.", "Tyler: Well, I'm kind of handicapped. I have a dirty fork.", "Lizzie: Get him a new one, coop. Now.", "Waitress: He'll probably want a spoon.", "Coop: This chili is for that guy? I'll take it to him. Don't worry about it. Oh, yeah.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marina: Ta-da! Welcome home! Oh, this place is great, isn't it? I mean, lots of space.", "Danny: Yeah, it'S... it's pretty great. It is. It's great. Especially when you look out the window. ( Laughter )", "Marina: Oh, come on. Oh, you could wait weeks to get a crew in here to repaint the place. Well, I don't need to tell you that. You're in the business.", "Danny: That's right.", "Marina: Only that means weeks until you can move in.", "Danny: Yeah, well... I can do it myself.", "Marina: ( Laughs ) actually, I have a surprise for you.", "Danny: Are you not wearing anything under that coat?", "Marina: Oh, you're so funny. Nice guess, but no. Actually, I snuck in here this afternoon, after I met with the landlord.", "Danny: Snuck in?", "Marina: Yes.", "Danny: Why? For what?", "Marina: This.", "Danny: Did you buy all that stuff?", "Marina: Mm-hmm. Want to mess around?", "Danny: ( Chuckles )", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: You know what? I bet this is the apartment that marina found for them. Look. It's all circled.", "Tony: Yeah, sure is.", "Michelle: We should buy them a housewarming present.", "Tony: You want to buy them a present?", "Michelle: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Come on. Why don't we go over there and we'll surprise them.", "Tony: You want to go where, exactly? Huh?", "Michelle: To the apartment. Are you paying attention?", "Tony: Ha-ha.", "Michelle: I'm kidding, I'm kidding. But I do really want to go over there. This stuff can wait, right?", "Tony: All right. After that, we go out on a date, huh?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tyler: ( Gasping )", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Frank: Harley, don't do this.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Just give me a minute, frank. You've already done major prison time, and you just got busted again. For a felony. How long do you think you'd be locked up if you didn't cut this sweet little deal with the da?", "Webster: Hey, I'm the first to admit seeing that ruth lady split that night is the best break I've had in a dog's age.", "Harley: And after months of silence-- months-- you spill the details, right after you get arrested.", "Webster: I caught a report on the radio about your trial. It hit me, the stuff I knew might be... come in handy one rainy day.", "Harley: You get nabbed, you get locked up, and damn if it wasn't pouring out, huh?", "Webster: Lady, what's your problem? I saw the dude in the restaurant alone. Alive. It's like you don't want to believe you didn't kill the guy.", "Harley: I just want to know what to believe.", "Webster: What can I say? You're innocent.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Frank: Harley, look at the test. He hasn't even lied once.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: The guy might be a lowlife, but his story stands up.", "Harley: Good. That's good. Yeah.", "Gus: How long have you been here?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: Long enough to hear what I needed to hear. Harley, I hope you're not planning on reneging on our deal. Because if you do, it'll be another mistake.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: So alan doesn't want to just take emma away from me, he wants to pin phillip's murder on me, first.", "Alexandra: Olivia, what did you expect when you came back to spaulding?", "Olivia: Well, I didn't sign on to be alan's whipping girl, i can tell you that.", "Alexandra: Well, you knew there was going to be some risk, didn't you?", "Olivia: Yes.", "Alexandra: Well, then what are you afraid of? You've protected yourself against alan before. You can do it again. Unless, of course, you have something to hide.", "Olivia: Like what?", "Alexandra: I don't know. I'm not privy to alan's informational world, but whatever he deems a weapon, i suppose.", "Olivia: You have to help me. Help me. Please. For emma's sake, alexandra. Please. I need to know exactly what kind of danger I'm in.", "Alexandra: All right. First thing, I suggest you just stay as calm as you can. And then do everything alan tells you.", "Olivia: Harley. Her being exonerated has nothing to do with me.", "Alexandra: Well, if harley goes free, that leaves you vulnerable to alan. So it's just something to think about.", "Olivia: Thanks for nothing. Um, jeffrey o'neill, please. It's olivia spencer. Could you tell him that I need to talk to him about the harley cooper murder case? And it's urgent.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marina: You know, I'm definitely getting a \"less is more\" vibe from the place. I was thinking maybe we could do some sponge on the paint, give it this nice textured feel.", "Danny: Ugh. No, no, no. No sponge. Danny no likey the sponge.", "Marina: Yes, it's nice.", "Danny: No, no.", "Marina: What color do you think we should do the kitchen?", "Danny: You mean that little wall? I don't know. What color is the most manly?", "Marina: Whatever color you're standing next to.", "Danny: Oh, good answer.", "Marina: Actually, I was going to suggest a nice, warm salmon.", "Danny: That just makes me hungry. How about this? I mean, I like this color.", "Marina: Yeah?", "Danny: Don't you? Looks good to me.", "Marina: Actually, I was thinking something more along the lines of this.", "Danny: Yeah?", "Marina: Uh-huh.", "Danny: Really?", "Marina: You're going to pay for that. Wait until I get my hands on the roller.", "Danny: No, no, no, no, no. No.", "Marina: Oh, yeah.", "Danny: No.", "Marina: Oh, yeah.", "Danny: No, no. Drop it. Drop it. ( Laughter ) drop it.", "Marina: ( Shrieks ) ( laughter ) ( knock on door )", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: Cool, a paint fight. We're good at those, right?", "Tony: Yeah.", "Danny: Hey. What are you guys doing here?", "Marina: How'd you even find the place?", "Michelle: Well, we came over to help you guys celebrate.", "Danny: Celebrate? Celebrate what?", "Michelle: You two moving in together. You know, I hope you're as happy as tony and I are.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: So, your conscience is clear, harley. Well, that's good. I just wonder if the jury will accept the testimony of an ex- con, especially one that just cut a deal with the da.", "Gus: The man knows what he saw, he knows what he didn't see, and she clearly didn't shoot anybody.", "Alan: You signed a statement changing your plea to guilty. Now, that sends a very strong message to the jury.", "Gus: Don't listen to what he's saying, baby.", "Alan: More bad advice from your attorney. This is not just about criminal records or prison time. This is about family and children.", "Harley: Time to threaten me again, huh?", "Alan: Harley, our agreement was very simple. You plead guilty to manslaughter, and I allow zach to be raised by your family.", "Harley: You \"allow.\"", "Alan: Yes. And I would also stop disbarment proceedings against gus, and in general ease up on the people that you love.", "Gus: I don't think you understand. The situation has changed.", "Alan: Yeah, well, perhaps it hasn't changed quite enough. You know, you could go back in that courtroom and lose. This big break of yours may not prove to be big enough.", "Harley: Then what?", "Alan: Then I take my grandson home and raise him as a spaulding, the way he should be raised. Like his father would want.", "Harley: But I'M... I might be innocent, alan. I mean, don't you care at all about the truth?", "Alan: I care about justice and I want the people who hurt phillip to pay. And you are at the top of the list.", "Gus: Baby, don't listen to him, okay? We are going to win this thing.", "Alan: Careful, harley. Gus has failed you in the past. Are you going to put faith in him now? Can you count on him, now that everything you hold precious is on the line? Coming up on \"guiding light\"...", "Alan: You're not innocent, either, olivia.", "Olivia: What makes you think you can cook up something that would incriminate me?", "Alan: And what makes you think I would have to \"cook up\" anything?", "Harley: I'm choosing to believe in you. Again. Don't make me live to regret this.", "Gus: Listen to me. I'm not going to let you get hurt, okay?", "Alan: Promises, promises.", "Gus: We have taken a beating because we want something special and good in our lives, and some people, they can't stand that. Some families, they can't stand that, but that's not us. Now, I know there's a lot on the line: Your future, zach's future, your freedom. But we're going to win. We're going to beat this thing, okay? It's going to turn out the way we want it to. This is the way it's going to be.", "Alan: This is pathetic.", "Gus: Just because you are all about control and revenge, it doesn't mean the rest of us can't act like human beings, okay? Baby, don't be afraid. Okay? You're just going to have to trust me. Just one more time.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Frank: Can you feel air going in there?", "Zach: Yeah.", "Frank: You getting a little tired? Okay.", "Harley: Hey. Do you think that gus is a good guy? Do you believe what gus says to you?", "Zach: Yeah.", "Harley: Yeah. The deal's off, alan. My lawyer and I will be going to court.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: I hope you can live with your choice, because you are going to regret it the rest of your life.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: Thank you. You'll see.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Don't thank me. Just prove me right. I'm choosing to believe in you. Again. Don't make me live to regret this.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Coop: So, where's romeo at?", "Lizzie: Tyler went to go smoke a cigarette.", "Coop: I'm surprised you're hanging out with a smoker. I thought you didn't like the smell of cigarettes.", "Lizzie: That's exactly why tyler's outside.", "Coop: I know what you're doing, lizzie, bringing wonder prep around.", "Lizzie: Excuse me?", "Coop: You're not fooling me for one minute.", "Lizzie: Good. I'm glad there's no misunderstanding. And before you clean the bathroom, make sure you take the trash out.", "Coop: Sure.", "Lizzie: What are you doing? Coop, let go of me! Put me down now! Now!", "Coop: Ow.", "Lizzie: You are such an idiot.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tyler: I noticed you the second I walked in the door.", "Waitress: Really?", "Tyler: Yeah. So, when do you get off tonight?", "Waitress: Not for a while.", "Tyler: Well, that's no problem. You're worth the wait.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: This is just a little something to, you know, help you around the house.", "Danny: Oh, well, thank you. Thanks. Listen, michelle, about this place...", "Michelle: Don't tell me you're not going to take it, because that would be a really incredible waste of paint. And, you know, this amazing space, here.", "Danny: No, I mean I am taking it, but marina and I are not moving in together.", "Michelle: I don't understand, because we... tony and I heard you guys at company saying that you didn't want to let this place slip out of your hands.", "Danny: Oh, no, no, no. Marina just... she found the place for me. That's all. That's it. So, I mean, well, what do you think? It's pretty great, huh? I mean, it will be great, once it's painted.", "Michelle: Yeah, I hope so. I mean, really... enjoy it. I hope you like the present, too.", "Danny: Thank you.", "Tony: Okay. All right, well we will leave you to fling paint brushes.", "Michelle: Listen, I really do mean it. I hope you're happy here.", "Tony: Michelle, he's going to want what's best for his kid.", "Michelle: He does, tony, you know that.", "Tony: Even if that means letting robbie live here full- time?", "Michelle: ( Laughs ) danny would never go for that.", "Tony: I'm telling you, hey, it's not a bad idea.", "Michelle: Do you really think we could?", "Tony: Your son belongs with you.", "Michelle: And if you need any extra hands cleaning up or moving stuff, just let me know, okay? Bye.", "Danny: Okay.", "Tony: Nice place, danny. See you.", "Danny: See you. Well, that was nice of her.", "Marina: Yeah. Hey.", "Danny: Hm?", "Marina: Just be careful around michelle, okay?", "Michelle: Okay, I could have sworn they said they were moving in together.", "Tony: Or maybe, babe, that's what you wanted to hear. All right? Come on, let's go.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: Jeffrey? Hello? Look, your secretary said a half an hour, so... hello? Look, I'm not really in the mood for games, so if we could just... you know what? Never mind. Alan.", "Alan: A little bird told me you were going to talk to jeffrey o'neill about harley's case. I think you should talk to me first.", "Olivia: Why?", "Alan: Because she's going to get off.", "Olivia: Harley?", "Alan: She's going to walk out of this courtroom a free woman and get on with her life.", "Olivia: So the witness that came forward can prove that she's innocent.", "Alan: She's not innocent, but the law will say so. And phillip will be forgotten, unless I can change things and find another way.", "Olivia: Another way? Or another person. A replacement for harley. A stand-in for guilt. Me.", "Alan: You're not innocent, either, olivia.", "Olivia: What makes you think you can cook up something that would incriminate me?", "Alan: And what makes you think I would have to \"cook up\" anything?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tyler: So, listen...", "Coop: Hey. She can't listen. She's got a shift to finish up. You, inside. Right now.", "Tyler: Hey, hey.", "Coop: I don't think so.", "Tyler: Man, what's your problem?", "Coop: What's my problem? I'll tell you what my problem is. You can't have one date at one time, casanova?", "Tyler: I'm just covering my bases, that's all. What's it to you, anyhow?", "Coop: Covering your bases.", "Tyler: Lizzie's a babe and a real spaulding, which is a plus, but, you know, if the crazy thing gets out of hand, I've got to have a backup. I mean, I've heard a lot about lizzie.", "Coop: Like what?", "Tyler: Like she's pretty much one step away from going to the same whack-farm her father got locked up in for a while.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Coop: You know what the great thing about parking in the handicapped spot is? It means you can leave faster. If I ever catch you back here again, don't you ever come back!", "Lizzie: Coop, wait! What's going on?", "Coop: Turns out that tyler had to leave a little early.", "Lizzie: You are unbelievable. I finally find a guy that wants to go out with me and you have to go screw it up.", "Coop: That's right, lizzie. That's exactly what I did.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: Wait, hold up. Hold up. What do you mean, be careful of michelle?", "Marina: Nothing.", "Danny: Marina, stop. What's going on? Oh. Are you jealous? Are you jealous?", "Marina: No. I am not. I am not jealous.", "Danny: Really?", "Marina: Really. I just want to make sure that you're okay.", "Danny: Well, yeah, I'm okay. I mean, I seem okay right now, don't I?", "Marina: That's because I'm here.", "Danny: Oh. And michelle's not. Listen, michelle and I can be friends. I want to. We're robbie's parents and that's important for him, but it will not get in the way of what's going on between us.", "Marina: Are we going to paint, or what?", "Danny: No. No, no, no. No. Come here. Have I told you how much i appreciate you finding this place for me? No? Okay.", "Marina: Wow. It really pays to read the classifieds. ( Laughs ) so, you really think there's an \"us\"?", "Danny: What do you think?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tony: Okay, I am going to get you a drink, so you can keep your mind off of danny.", "Michelle: I'm not thinking about danny.", "Tony: Yeah, yeah, yeah.", "Danny: Happy valentine's day, honey.", "Michelle: Thank you.", "Danny: I love you.", "Tony: Here you go.", "Michelle: Thanks. Thanks.", "Tony: So?", "Michelle: All right, so you're the expert.", "Tony: Yeah. ( Laughs )", "Michelle: Why was I so quick to jump to the conclusion that danny and marina were a serious item?", "Tony: Okay, first of all, i am no expert on anything, pretty much. But I think that you... I don't know, I think that if you were sure that danny was with marina, that it would keep him from coming between us, I guess. I don't know.", "Michelle: Maybe.", "Tony: I know you've had memories about your life, all right? I do. I just happen to think that it's happening a lot more often than you've really admitted to me, that's all.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: Means, motives, opportunities. You had all three of them. And you know something, olivia? No one despised phillip more than you did or was happier when he died. You couldn't even contain your happiness at the hospital when his body was still getting cold.", "Olivia: Yeah, well, I had a lot of company.", "Alan: Yeah. And you also had these. Ah, look familiar. One way tickets to san cristobel for you and emma. Yeah. You purchased these just days after he was shot.", "Olivia: That doesn't prove anything.", "Alan: It proves you were leaving the country, on the run, and not planning on returning.", "Olivia: I didn't leave. I didn't run, did I? How did you get those, anyway?", "Alan: You know, the police aren't the only ones capable of investigation. Matter of fact, I have a lot of evidence on you, olivia. Evidence I won't have to fabricate at all. It'll be very interesting for the jury to see.", "Olivia: No, no. Apparently it wasn't enough for them to charge me with the crime in the first place. Why should I worry about it now?", "Alan: You left the towers well before phillip was shot and you were seen immediately thereafter. You made a total fool of yourself and were out of control at his funeral. You checked yourself into a mental hospital just weeks later.", "Olivia: No. No. You had me locked up.", "Alan: Yes, but the records show that you signed the intake papers voluntarily.", "Olivia: You set me up, alan.", "Alan: Well, why don't you try to explain to that the judge or the jury.", "Olivia: I don't have to explain it to anybody. I'm innocent.", "Alan: I have lots of facts on you. Just think how they're going to look. Oh, I think I could probably prove that you murdered phillip and have you put away and have emma all to myself.", "Olivia: I did not kill him!", "Alan: Then tell me what you're willing to do to protect your innocence and your freedom.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Dear, you bring me back some of those corn nuts, okay? Don't eat them all.", "Gus: ( Laughs ) I love you.", "Harley: Don't give me \"love,\" okay? Because eight months ago, I set aside all my doubts and fears about getting married again, i set them aside for you. And that was about love.", "Gus: You know what's funny? On that note, what you just said?", "Harley: No, let me finish, because if I don'T... if I don't just get this out...", "Gus: All right.", "Harley: I've got to go into this.", "Gus: I'm sorry.", "Harley: I'm telling you how i feel.", "Gus: I'm sorry I interrupted you. Go ahead.", "Harley: I can't have my heart broken again. I mean it. I can'T. I was at peace with the fact that I was saying goodbye to my kids, and I was going to do my time in prison, and you're standing here, you're getting my hopes up again, and you're telling me I might not have to go.", "Gus: You're not going. You're not going.", "Harley: I know, but what if i do?", "Gus: Just listen.", "Harley: No, you listen. It's going to be like our wedding day all over again. No, it's going to be worse, and I can'T... I can't take it. I'm not kidding.", "Gus: I want to tell you something. This morning, I was thinking about something. That if you had actually walked down the aisle with me back in july, we'd have made it. Even with all this garbage that's going on, we would have made it. We would have made a life together, a beautiful life together.", "Harley: ( Sobs ) you are either the most romantic guy in the world, or the stupidest. ( Laughs )", "Gus: If I'm the stupidest, I'd have given up the idea of us a long time ago. Believe me.", "Harley: I'm scared. I'm scared.", "Gus: I know. I know. Of course you are. I am, too. But you can't let that stop you. So now, I am going to ask you to go down the aisle with me again, okay? Only this time it's a different aisle, and it's going to affect our future even... even in bigger ways. You understand?", "Harley: Swear to me that you won't make me sorry that I'm doing this, okay?", "Gus: I swear. I'm not going to lose you again.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: You don't have much time, olivia, to plan a defense. Because very shortly, someone is going to get on that stand, take an oath and turn this courtroom upside down. Harley will go free and phillip's murder will be unsolved. Until I can find another suspect.", "Olivia: I did not kill him. How many times do I have to say it?", "Alan: The question is: Do you want to try to convince a judge and jury? Because that is what you're going to do if harley goes free.", "Olivia: Alan, what do you expect me to do? Make sure she isn't cleared?", "Alan: I expect you to do what's best for you. Take care of number one and to hell with everyone else.", "Olivia: No. This is insanity.", "Alan: No. It's justice the way it should be.", "Olivia: How do you expect me to fix a murder trial?", "Alan: I think you're going to figure it out. Because I've got faith in you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: How dare you throw a friend of mine out like that.", "Coop: Lizzie, please. All right, you brought that loser in here to send me a signal.", "Lizzie: A signal? Oh, gosh, this has got to be great. Go ahead, coop.", "Coop: Lizzie, it's obvious. All right? You bring mr. Hot shot biz-whiz from state in here, start parading him around. You start chewing me out like I'm some sort of busboy, in front of him. You do all this just because you want to make me feel small. Is that right?", "Lizzie: No. No. That's not... it's nothing about you at all. I happen to like tyler a lot. He's very sweet.", "Coop: He's what? He's sweet? He's a snob. He's a white-collar criminal of tomorrow. Lizzie, what is so appealing about that guy?", "Lizzie: He's nothing like you.", "Coop: Really. Lizzie, he's not even close. ( Laughter ) ( cell phone ringing )", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: Is that mine?", "Marina: No, it's mine. Hello? Oh, hey dad, what's up? What? Oh, my gosh, yes. Yes. I... I'll be right there. Yes. I'll see you soon. Okay, bye.", "Danny: What?", "Marina: So, that guy that showed up, witnessed harley leaving? It turns out that he's telling the truth.", "Danny: Oh, that's fantastic.", "Marina: Harley is so close to getting cleared.", "Danny: Great.", "Marina: Danny.", "Danny: What? No. No, stop. It's okay. Actually, I'm really glad that your phone rang.", "Marina: Yeah?", "Danny: Yeah. Yeah. Because that wouldn't have been right. I mean, it would have been right, but... you know, I... it can be... I want it to be righter.", "Marina: Yeah. Do me a favor, though?", "Danny: What?", "Marina: Stop looking at me like that.", "Danny: Why? You don't like it?", "Marina: No, I... I do. That's the problem. I like it a lot.", "Danny: I think you're looking at me the same way.", "Marina: Maybe.", "Danny: Get out of here.", "Marina: I've got to go see harley.", "Danny: Go. Good luck.", "Marina: Thank you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: Look, I...", "Tony: Yes?", "Michelle: ...Have had some memories. I have. Okay? And it scares me a little. I... you know, I just don't want it to scare you. And I don't want it to upset you. That's why I came off as this big cheerleader for danny and marina, because I figured, you know, the faster we all kind of settle down, the quicker things will work themselves out, you know?", "Tony: In your head, you mean. Right?", "Michelle: And yours. Listen, you're the guy I'm moving in with.", "Tony: Yeah, well, you know.", "Michelle: Hey, you're the guy that I love.", "Tony: I know that.", "Michelle: Memories are just... they're just memories, right?
