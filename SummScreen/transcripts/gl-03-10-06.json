        "Tammy: This is everything, right? ",
        "Jonathan: This is everything. ",
        "Tammy: Our first time together. ",
        "Jonathan: I wish it was. ",
        "Tammy: It was. Hey, Jonathan, look at me.\r\n",
        "Jonathan: Tammy... ",
        "Tammy: It was our first time. Hey, no, no, \r\nno, whatever it is-- ",
        "Jonathan: No, listen. ( Foot steps ) \n",
        "Tammy: Stop it, no, no, no. Nothing else \r\nmatters. Trust me. ( Foot steps stop ) just like I told you, this is everything. \r\nEverything anyone could ever hope for or dream of. This is everything. \n",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nAlan-Michael: Very true, Mr. Mcmullen. Dinah Marler and Harley were very tight. \r\nShe chose Dinah to step in as CEO, I think that says it all. However, I've seen \r\nsome signs lately that their relationship is not quite as solid as every one \r\nthought it was. Yes, I'll be sure I'll let you know if I hear of anything \r\ninteresting. No. Thank you. I'll be in touch. As soon as I hear something \r\ninteresting. Sorry, Dinah, desperate times. ",
        "Harley: I went a little too far. I \r\nslept with Mallet. ",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nMarina: Guess who? ",
        "Alan-Michael: Is it my favorite red-haired \r\nSpringfield cop? ",
        "Marina: Ooh, you're good. So what are you \r\nlistening to. Can I hear? ",
        "Alan-Michael: I've got a better idea. \n",
        "You're all of the man I need...\r\n",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nAlan: Beth... ",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nMallet: She bit. ",
        "Harley: Sh-sh-sh. She's by the elevator; I \r\ndon't want her to hear us. ",
        "Mallet: Don't worry about it, she doesn't \r\nknow we set her up. ",
        "Harley: We? I set her up. I mean, thank you \r\nvery much, but I can take it from here. She's getting on the elevator. I'm going \r\nto go get the car. ",
        "Mallet: Hold on, hold on. ",
        "Harley: What, what? ",
        "Mallet: Just tell me one thing. Tell me that \r\nthat you don't think following Beth is somehow going to lead you to Gus. Tell me \r\nthat. ",
        "Harley: I swear I will smack you if-- \n",
        "Mallet: Because if that's what you're \r\nthinking, if that's what you believe, I'm going with you. ",
        "Harley: No. ",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I'm going to do that-- \n",
        "Harley: No, no, no. Listen to me. I have to \r\ndo this on my own. I just want to get some answers, maybe she can fill in some \r\nblanks for me. If she knows anything about Alan and Gus, I just want to know \r\nwhat that is, that's all. ",
        "Mallet: And then what? ",
        "Harley: Follow it wherever it leads. \n",
        "Dinah: Ah, no you don't. ",
        "Harley: Dinah. Dinah... ",
        "Mallet: Wait, we're in the middle of a case \r\nhere. ",
        "Dinah: I know that. But you both aren't going \r\nanywhere until I say what I have to say to both of you. ",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nJonathan: You're quiet. ",
        "Tammy: No need to talk. Everything's so \r\nperfect. ",
        "Jonathan: The only perfect thing here is you.\r\n",
        "Tammy: ( Laughing ) ",
        "Jonathan: Talk. I want to hear your voice. \r\nWhat are you looking at? ",
        "Tammy: I want to remember everything about \r\nthis room, the walls, the floors, the lamp and carry it with me. ",
        "Jonathan: We can live here, instead of \r\nOutskirts. ",
        "Tammy: No, it's not about that. It's just \r\nabout not wanting to forget one of the most amazing moments of my life. \n",
        "Jonathan: I've never been part of anything \r\ngood before. I never thought that-- ",
        "Tammy: I always knew that this would happen. \r\nYou and me. I knew it since the first day I met you. ",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughing ) No way! ",
        "Tammy: Yeah. Somewhere inside me, I knew that \r\nwe had to be together. ",
        "Jonathan: Promise me that you'll never forget \r\nwhat happened here tonight? ",
        "Tammy: What did I just say? ",
        "Jonathan: Promise, no matter what. \n",
        "Tammy: I promise you. I will always remember \r\nthis as the night that my life really started. ",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nAlan-Michael: Have I told you how much I've been missing you these last few \r\ndays? ",
        "Marina: No yet. Where you've been. \n",
        "Marina: Oh, my gosh. I so don't need this \r\nright now. ",
        "Frank: That's a nice little greeting for your \r\nfather. ",
        "Marina: Dad, you promised. You are spying on \r\nus again. ",
        "Frank: Spying on who? You're all alone, \r\naren't you? And, besides, I'm here making reservations for me and Olivia. \n",
        "Marina: Oh. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, but now that you reminded me, it \r\nstill makes me sick you're still seeing Alan-Michael, but after that whole mess \r\nwith Danny, you honestly deserve a little time to have some fun and... \n",
        "Marina: Well, thank you so much for \r\nunderstanding. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, well maybe after that little \r\nfun, you can move on to the right guy-- the next guy, the right guy-- hopefully \r\nsomeone you can get serious about. ",
        "Marina: Right. ",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nAlexandra: So, you're still seeing Marina Cooper. ",
        "Alan-Michael: What do you want? Because I \r\nknow you don't give a damn who I'm dating. ",
        "Alexandra: I just want to make certain that \r\nyou and Marina-- neither one of you are hurt. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Really? That's very touching.\r\n",
        "Alexandra: I also don't want to see you \r\ndistracted if you have your heart set on taking over the company. That's a \r\nfull-time romance. ",
        "Alan-Michael: And it matters to you \r\nbecause...? ",
        "Alexandra: Because you're the best man for \r\nthe job. ",
        "Alan-Michael: And? ",
        "Alexandra: And-- all right, I don't like \r\nbeing shut out of things and I miss the action. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Don't worry, as far as the \r\nbusiness goes, as far as Marina goes, I've got everything under control. \n",
        "Mallet: Dinah, we're in the middle of a case \r\nhere. ",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nDinah: No, you're not. You're not chasing down Beth. ",
        "Harley: Yeah, we are. That's exactly what \r\nshe's doing. We've got to find out where she's going. It's very, very important, \r\nDinah. ",
        "Dinah: Harley, she is sick. She's pregnant \r\nand she's going home to rest. ",
        "Harley: You don't know that. ",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I do. You guys listen, you are \r\ndesperate. You are grabbing at straws and you don't know that Beth knows \r\nanything. ",
        "Harley: What is wrong with that? ",
        "Dinah: You know what? Come here. Nothing, \r\nnothing's wrong with that. In a lot of cases, that would be enough, okay. But in \r\nthis instance, we don't even have straws to grab at. Harley, I'm sorry, but it \r\nis difficult to watch sometimes. I mean, to see the two of you build up your \r\nhopes just to see them come crashing down again. You lost your partner, I \r\nunderstand that. And you lost the love of your life. But you know what, I've got \r\nto tell you something, I said that it was okay for you two to partner up again, \r\nbecause I thought the two of you could bring each other through something. But \r\nyou know what, that's not happening because the two of you are happening to keep \r\nit alive. And you know what? And that's not healthy. ",
        "Mallet: It's not as simple as that. \n",
        "Dinah: Yes, it is. Do you remember, Mallet, \r\nwhen you told me that you were a little worried that you were going to hurt \r\nHarley? Well guess what? That is exactly what you're doing because you are \r\nsetting up your partner for a very big fall. ",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nBeth: Alan! Oh, God, oh, God no. Oh, God no. Oh, God. Oh, God, no. ",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nHarley: Dinah, I know what you're doing. Really, you're looking out for me, and \r\nI'm grateful for that, but I'm a cop, okay. I am not jumping to conclusions \r\nhere. Mallet. ",
        "Mallet: No, she's not, she's not jumping.\r\n",
        "Harley: Of course the thought is always there \r\nthat Gus might be alive. Of course, I'm thinking that, a little part of me, \r\nsure. ",
        "Dinah: Listen, you guys are holding onto his \r\nhope, this irrational hope, and you're desperate. For goodness sakes, Beth is \r\npregnant. Come on, you guys. ",
        "Harley: We're not chasing a pregnant woman.\r\n",
        "Dinah: Yes, you are. I am the queen of not \r\nletting go. I am the queen of not letting go of the pain and the anger and the \r\ngrudges, but you know what? You taught me that there was a better way-- both of \r\nyou did. You said it was time to let go, and I did. I made room for new things \r\nin my life. Since you taught me that, maybe it is my turn to teach you to let \r\ngo, Harley. You have got to let go of Gus. ",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nBeth: Come on, don't you let go. Don't you go soft on me. Come on, Alan. Come \r\non, come on, Alan! Come on. ( Gasping ) Yes. ",
        "Alan: Beth? ",
        "Beth: Yes. Alan, it's me. It's me. You stay \r\nawake; you stay focused. You talk to me. You talk to me about Gus. You talk to \r\nme about Gus, Alan. ",
        "Alan: Gus? Gus. ",
        "Beth: He's still breathing. ",
        "Alan: Beth. ",
        "Beth: I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming. \r\nYou're alive, yes. You're still alive. You're still alive. ( Screams ) (gasps )\r\n",
        "Alan: I'm alive. You wanted us dead. \n",
        "Beth: Listen to me. No, everything's changed. \r\nYou don't understand. ",
        "Alan: You listen to me. You are going to pay \r\nfor this. ",
        "Beth: No, you have to help me clean this up. \r\nAlan, please. Please! ( Gasping ) ",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nTammy: Now you're quiet. ",
        "Jonathan: Me? Nah. ",
        "Tammy: What are you thinking about? \n",
        "Jonathan: I would do anything for you, you \r\nknow that, right? ",
        "Tammy: Of course I do. ",
        "Jonathan: Well, I want us to have a new life. \r\nI want us to be able to walk out of here and not have to look over our \r\nshoulders. ",
        "Tammy: Oh. You're thinking about what \r\nhappened with Sandy again. Well, just forget it. I learned my lesson. You were \r\nright about Sandy from the start. ",
        "Jonathan: I know. Sandy is part of the past, \r\nso let him go. ",
        "Tammy: I have. I just-- ",
        "Jonathan: No, it's done, Tammy. Trust me. You \r\nnever have to worry about Sandy anymore. ",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nFrank: You know, I want you to know something, that you were right about \r\nsomething, okay. You were right about Tammy and Cassie, about what happens when \r\na parent tries to keep a child away from somebody. ",
        "Marina: I am not a child. ",
        "Frank: Well, I'm still working on that one.\r\n",
        "Marina: Good. ",
        "Frank: Can you give me some credit here? For \r\nseeing what happened when Cassie just dug her heels in the ground about \r\nJonathan-- that Tammy just wanted to hold onto him even more. Maybe if she just \r\nkind of would've sat back a little bit and kept quiet, maybe that whole \r\nrelationship would have dissolved by now. ",
        "Marina: Dad, you know what? Stop. Let me be \r\nhonest with you, okay? ",
        "Frank: Sure. ",
        "Marina: Not a lot of people in this town are \r\nwilling to give Alan-Michael a fair shot, okay? His own father backhanded him \r\nfrom the grave in his will. And what's he been doing all the meanwhile? He's \r\nhelping Dinah at Spaulding because Harley asked him to. And he's been really \r\ngreat with me. So there's no reason to doubt him. Okay, I know he's got a \r\nhistory. Who doesn't? ",
        "Frank: Honey, it's a little bit more \r\ncomplicated than that. ",
        "Marina: Ooh, I don't want to hear about \r\ncomplications. It's been simple. And right now, I need simple. And he deserves \r\nmore than that, too. He deserves to hear how terrific he is. ",
        "Frank: From you? ",
        "Marina: Not just from me. ",
        "Frank: Oh, honey, if you want to save \r\nsomething, save the environment or dolphins or whales or something-- ",
        "Marina: It's not about saving him. It's not \r\njust about having a good old time, anymore, either. ",
        "Frank: Oh, great. ",
        "Marina: There's more to it-- to us-- than \r\nthat. ",
        "Frank: There is? Can I ask you a favor right \r\nnow? ",
        "Marina: I can do my best. ",
        "Frank: Can we not talk about this anymore, \r\njust for a moment? Because I think I'm getting a little more information than I \r\nreally want to have right now, okay? ",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nAlexandra: Darling, of course I'm looking out for myself. If I don't, who will.\r\n",
        "Alan-Michael: Got to love this family. \n",
        "Alexandra: I do. We both do. And you and I \r\nactually have a lot in common. We're never considered first. We're always \r\nexpected to follow, but never lead. ",
        "Alan-Michael: And yet we're always the most \r\nqualified. ",
        "Alexandra: I think so, and I think the time \r\nis right for us to step up. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Us? ",
        "Alexandra: Well, yes, of course, darling. \r\nIt's a family company. Spaulding needs to be in the leadership position, don't \r\nyou think? And I'm not talking about the short-term. I'm talking about long-term \r\nleadership this time, and you deserve it. So, darling, it's going to be out with \r\nHarley Cooper and her lap dog, Dinah. Long overdue-- way, way overdue. \n",
        "Alan-Michael: Can I play something for you, \r\nAunt Alex? ",
        "Alexandra: Excuse me? ",
        "Alan-Michael: It won't take long, and I \r\nguarantee you'll love the beat. The lyrics aren't bad either. ",
        "Alexandra: ( Laughs ) Wait, is that? \n",
        "Alan-Michael: Harley. ",
        "Alexandra: Well, well. Aren't we hard at \r\nwork? I should have known. ",
        "Alan-Michael: It's only a matter of time now \r\nbefore the big smack-down. When Dinah finds out about Harley and Mallet, it will \r\nbe the fight of the century and when the smoke clears... ",
        "Alexandra: Yes, will you be right there on \r\nyour feet to take over your rightful position. ",
        "Alan-Michael: At the head of the table, with \r\nno blood on my hands. ",
        "Alexandra: Oh, what about this Cooper girl?\r\n",
        "Alan-Michael: She knows it's not all that \r\nserious. ",
        "Alexandra: Oh, does she? ",
        "Alan-Michael: Yes, I've been telling her that \r\nfrom the very beginning. And even if it does get serious, don't worry Aunt Alex, \r\nif I want it, I know I can have it all. ",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nBeth:( Gasping ) Pregnant. Your baby. ( Gasps ) ( coughing ) ",
        "Alan: What? What? ",
        "Beth: I'm pregnant. Your baby. ( Breathing \r\nheavily) ",
        "Alan: With my baby. Oh, my God. A child. Just \r\nwhen I was about to give up on life. It's a miracle. ",
        "Beth: No, Alan. The only miracle here is that \r\nI didn't leave you to rot because I would have, believe me, I would have. \n",
        "Alan: But you didn't, Beth. You didn't leave \r\nme here, and that means-- ",
        "Beth: That means we're exactly back to where \r\nwe were before-- I'm in charge. This baby doesn't change that. ",
        "Alan: Yes, you're in charge, Beth. And you \r\ncame back because you know you don't want to raise that child alone. That child \r\nneeds a father. ",
        "Beth: What, to make him miserable?! I would \r\ngive anything to turn around and walk right back out that door! But I'm not \r\ngoing to jail, not for you! I will not lose this baby. Do you understand that, \r\nAlan? That is the only reason that I came back. This baby! This life! Damn you. \r\nDamn you!! ( Coughing ) ",
        "Alan: Beth? Beth, are you all right? Beth, \r\nlet me help you. ",
        "Beth: Don't you talk to me like that! Don't \r\nyou talk to me like suddenly our relationship has hanged because I'm carrying \r\nyour precious DNA. Because nothing has changed. I will never let you go, do you \r\nunderstand that? Because if I do-- if I do-- ",
        "Alan: Beth, you listen to me. If you do, if \r\nyou set me free, I will make everything all right. ",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nHarley: I hear what you're saying, Dinah, and I appreciate your concern, thank \r\nyou. ",
        "Dinah: But you're not going to stop? \n",
        "Harley: I can't. ",
        "Dinah: How did I know you'd say that? \n",
        "Mallet: Then why did you stop us? Because \r\nBeth's gone and who knows where she is now? ",
        "Dinah: I do. ",
        "Mallet: What? ",
        "Harley: You do? ",
        "Dinah: Yes. I so happened to lose my phone in \r\nher room when I was just in there just now. I just bought an expensive phone \r\nrecently with a GPS signal. And I happened to be around her stuff when it \r\naccidentally lost itself. So, the two of you are cops, so I'm sure you can go \r\nahead and track that down. ",
        "Harley: You planted your phone on Beth?\r\n",
        "Dinah: Yeah, accidents happen. I'm a klutz.\r\n",
        "Mallet: Wow. ",
        "Dinah: Sorry, baby. ",

        "Mallet: You're fabulous. ",
        "Dinah: Fabulous. ",
        "Harley: I love that about you. ( Laughter )\r\n",
        "Dinah: Thank you. Well, come on! What are you \r\ntwo doing? Let's go. Go ahead, go on your wild chase. ",
        "Mallet: Yes, boss. Yes, boss, let's go do it.\r\n",
        "Dinah: Hey! And while you two are at it, why \r\ndon't you find some closure if you can. ",
