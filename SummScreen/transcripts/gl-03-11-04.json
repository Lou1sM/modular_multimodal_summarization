{"Episode Summary": [], "Recap": ["Reva recognizes Jeffrey's concern for her daughter and directs him to the pool house. There, Marina has returned to comfort Marah and tell her that she's denying herself the human contact (Jeffrey) she needs. Marah can't help blaming herself for being used by Carrie, for naively doing exactly what Carrie wanted her to do. When Jeffrey appears, Marah's first impulse is to send him away. But he fights through her defenses, urging her to see herself as he sees her; brave, not weak, strong, not gullible. His words and his love are able to soothe her and Marah falls asleep in his arms. Josh begins the day handing the reins of power at Lewis Construction over to Bill on a permanent basis. Bill is ready for the challenge. For his part, Josh is ready to devote himself fully to his family, now more than ever. But when he shows up at Reva's house with his toothbrush, she isn't sure if this is a visit or a more lasting arrangement. She is overjoyed when Josh brings in the rest of his baggage and says that he's here to stay. Harley tries to get Buzz to talk about the events at the fairgrounds. Carrie may be dead, but Harley believes the evil lives after her. Buzz doesn't want to talk about it and wishes that the whole thing could just be over. But when Marina provides some missing details of Carrie's dirty tricks, the cave in, the razor blade and the gas leak, Harley becomes more convinced that her family needs the kind of protection Harley's Angels was meant to provide. Now, if only she could work a miracle for Gus and have Alan call to accept the deal that Gus offered him."], "Recap Author": "Megan", "Show Title": "Guiding Light", "Transcript": ["reva: Should you be here?", "Jeffrey: Probably not.", "Reva: Then maybe you should go.", "Jeffrey: Is she all right?", "Reva: As well as can be expected.", "Jeffrey: Oh, so she's here then.

What am I doing?", "Marah: Coming in here to cheer me up.", "Marina: Nah. I came here to sulk with you. You got another pair of slippers? Look, marah, i saw the look on your face when you saw me and shayne together.", "Marah: I'm just happy for you guys. I'm glad that you two have each other.", "Marina: Yeah, i'm glad, too. Because I couldn't get through this alone. Which brings me to you.", "Marah: What about me?", "Marina: What happened at the fairgrounds is going to stay with us. You especially. You were inside. You ...", "Marah: Killed someone.", "Marina: You shouldn't be alone right now.", "Marah: So what are you going to do? Stay with me till this is over?", "Marina: Why not?", "Marah: I can't ask you to do that.", "Marina: Well, then ask somebody else. Is there anyone else?", "Marah: No.", "Marina: Who, marah?", "Marah: You know what? It doesn't matter. Nobody can help me anyway. I just keep replaying that night over and over again. I shot carrie. How's that for irony? Couldn't even remember what happened and now i can't forget.", "Marina: You have to stop beating yourself up. It was self defense. You did what you had to do.", "Marah: No. I did exactly what carrie wanted me to do.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Josh: Hey.", "Billy: Yeah. Thanks.", "Josh: Did you talk to him?", "Billy: Yeah.", "Josh: You told him?", "Billy: He knows everything.", "Josh: Is he coming?", "Billy: Well, not right away. He's going to take a drive. I guess let things sink, but he'll be here pretty soon.", "Buzz: What are you guys doing out here? Come on in, I'll buy lunch.", "Josh: No, thank you. We're waiting for somebody.", "Buzz: I went to the station. I made a statement. I changed my statement.", "Billy: We went in there this morning.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Buzz: I can't wait for this to be over with. I am so sick of answering questions, you know. Come on in if you get cold. Oh, god.", "Harley: Where you at the station? What happened?", "Buzz: I gave the police my statement.", "Harley: You mean you changed your statement. Big difference.", "Buzz: I don't want to talk about this. I don't want to talk about this.", "Harley: Well, dad, there's a lot of stuff that we have to talk about.", "Buzz: Wait a second. How do you know?", "Harley: What do you think? Why didn't you tell me?", "Buzz: Well, it happened a long time ago.", "Harley: That's not an answer.", "Buzz: I don't want to go into this.", "Harley: Well, then wh?", "Buzz: You're asking me something about that happened 25 years ago. Will you ask me something that happened now? I can only deal with one thing at once, okay.", "Harley: Okay, okay. Fine, fine, fine. Let's talk about what happened just now.", "Buzz: Okay. All you have to know is that everything we did, me, billy, alan, josh, we did to protect someone. We made our statements... Our first statements to protect marah. A lot of good it did. We could be prosecuted for obstructing justice and she's as worse off.", "Harley: Well, i'm thinking about marah, too. I still have questions about what happened that night at the fairgrounds.", "Buzz: Oh, good god.", "Harley: Dad, please.", "Buzz: Do you remember the chat we had a couple of days ago where you said you wouldn't push?", "Harley: Yeah, but that's before i learned that you falsified a statement. Before i learned about mary caruthers.", "Buzz: I don't want to talk... I don't want to talk about this.", "Harley: Yeah, well, not talking about things though has worked out real well for you hasn't it, dad?", "Buzz: I want this to be over with, okay? Drop it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: Hey, babe.", "Harley: Hey, you.", "Gus: What's wrong?", "Harley: My dad. You?", "Gus: Oh, your dad. My dad.", "Harley: So you still haven't heard from alan?", "Gus: No, no, and I'm suppose to hear from him today, but he conveniently disappears.", "Harley: Yeah, my father conveniently disappeared, too. Into the kitchen!", "Gus: Hmm. Well, it seems that both of our dads are avoiding us.", "Harley: Yeah, looks like it. I'm not surprised. Are you?", "Gus: No. And I'll tell you what. I don't think we should take it.", "Harley: I don't think we should take it either.", "gus: I did it again. I put the money on my father, the big shot. And where did it get me? It got me no where. I'm an idiot.", "Harley: It got you here with me.", "Gus: I'm nowhere. I'm absolutely nowhere with my own father. I went all the way out on a limb to cut a deal for this guy.", "Harley: I know.", "Gus: No, all he had to do was cooperate with the feds, just let the spaulding investigation happen. But you do think he could step up to the plate? No.", "Harley: Of course he couldn't do it, hon.", "Gus: Yeah, well, why is that? Why do you think that is?", "Harley: Because alan is alan.", "Gus: What is that all about?", "Harley: And that's just the way that he does things. But I am sorry for you. And I'm sorry for him, because it's a good deal. I thought he'd take it.", "Gus: I gave him till today. I said, you know, wrestle with your conscious. But you know, it's funny, because the jokes on me. Because the man's got no conscience. He cares more about his own company than his own son. That doesn't make sense to me.", "Harley: See what's happening here is that you're new to is that you're new to the whole being-disappointed-by-your- father thing. It's a god thing i'm here to show you the ropes.", "Gus: Why? What did your father do?", "Harley: Went down to the police station, changed his statement.", "Gus: You're kidding me. So he went down to say that he falsified the first statement?", "Harley: Yep.", "Gus: So he went down to correct himself?", "Harley: Yeah.", "Gus: So. But that's a god thing, right? That's good.", "Harley: See, but there's a small problem here. The problem is that we still have not talked about the whole thing that happened at the fairgrounds. We still haven't talked about maryanne caruthers.", "Gus: Give him time.", "Harley: I'm sick of giving him time. You know what I mean? I am sick of it always being about him. What if just this one time he thought about the stress that he's causing us? What if this one time he, you know, he came through for us?", "Gus: I understand, baby. But at least he didn't run.", "Harley: No, but he may as well have. Because you know what? He's here physically, but he is shut down. I mean he says to me, he just wants the whole thing to go way. But I have to tell you, I don't think it's that simple.", "Gus: This caruther's woman is dead, right? How much... How much trouble can she cause from the grave? None, right? None.", "Harley: No. Don't be so sure.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Billy: Here he comes.", "Bill: I want you to know that i'm still not entirely okay with everything that happened.", "Josh: Well, neither are we.", "Bill: I mean, you guys, you're my heroes. I've grown up watching everything that you two went through. Watching you recover from things that a lesser man couldn't. And all a while you were carrying around this secret.", "Billy: No, no...", "Bill: Dad, please, just let me finish. You were carrying around this secret. And I know you... I know you didn't do it just to protect yourselves. I know you did it protect the ones that you love. I'm not saying you did the right thing, okay? But I understand why you did it. And a step up, like you are now with so much more at stake. So much more to lose. It just... It says a lot. Says a lot. And I just want you to know that i... You know whatever happens, I'm not looking for any new heroes, that's all.", "Billy: Thank you.", "Bill: Yeah. So anyway, how's marah doing?", "Josh: Holding up.", "Bill: Good. Well, if there's anything I can do, anything at all you just let me know.", "Josh: That's actually... That's why we asked you to meet us, bill.", "Billy: Yeah. Son, i always knew this day was going to come and I guess we hoped it would be under circumstances, but...", "Bill: Whoa, whoa, what are you talking about?", "Billy: Well, josh and i got our hands full right now.", "Josh: Yeah and I... Obviously i want to spend more time with reva and marah and shayne.", "Bill: Yeah. Look if this is about lewis construction, you know, you need me to pick up the slack for a while longer, it's not...", "Billy: No, no...", "Bill: ...Not a problem.", "Billy: It's not just picking up the slack. We kind of want you to run the company.", "Josh: We want you to run lewis construction, bill, on a permanent basis.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: So why did you let me in?", "Reva: To thank you. I know that sounds strange, but ever since marah confessed, you have gone out of your way to protect her. And josh and i are very grateful. But I also know you have a job to do.", "Jeffrey: Well, yeah, I might not have one when this is over.", "Reva: So that's why you can be here because you don't care? Doesn't matter?", "Jeffrey: Watching marah relive that night...", "Reva: A lot of men would take advantage of her...", "Jeffrey: No.", "Reva: Use her words against her.", "Jeffrey: No, no, no. Anyone that knows marah like i know her, anyone who cares about her like i...", "Reva: Jeffrey.", "Jeffrey: What?", "Reva: That fine line that you were walking, you just crossed it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marah: Some strange old lady who travels through tunnels ends up in our living room, and do we call the cops? No.", "Marina: Marah...", "Marah: She passes out these magic rings to us, and do we question her? No. No. We... Magic rings. What are we like five years old?", "Marina: Marah...", "Marah: She asked us to drill our parents, and do we refuse? Do we question her? No. We do whatever she wants.", "Marina: Marah, stop. We'll go crazy. Carrie made us believe that we were helping our families. She convinced us that she could make our wishes come true. Yeah, it may have sound stupid now, but it didn't then. Not when i wanted shayne to walk again. Not when michelle wanted to redeem danny's name.", "Marah: You know what? This is exactly what she wanted. She wanted one of us to kill her that night. What better way to get back at the men that you've hated for all of these years? And I did it. I killed her.", "Marina: No. You stopped her from killing your dad, and my grandfather and everyone else who was there that night. If i had been standing there, i hope that I would have had the courage to do the same thing.", "Marah: Courage doesn't make you fire a gun, marina. Fear does. And now a woman is dead because of it.", "Marina: A mad woman is dead. And if the d.A. Understood that...", "Marah: Stop. Just leave him out of this, okay.", "Marina: What?", "Marah: Jeffrey hates this as much as I do, all right. I don't know what I would have done without him. He helped me. Okay, he could have been fired, but he didn't care. And now because of me, we'll never get a chance...", "Marah: Jeffrey o'neill was your wish.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "josh: Bill, you've got what it takes to run lewis construction.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Look, i don't want it, okay, not like this. And look, it means everything to me that you think I can run the business. And I don't want to be ungrateful here, but i don't want to cash in on other people's misfortune.", "Josh: We're not other people. We're family.", "Bill: Which makes it even worse.", "Billy: No, no, we don't see it like that. Family means that come along and you pick up the flag when somebody else in the family can't carry it. And josh and i definitely cannot carry the flag. So you're going to come along and pick it up or what? You really don't owe us anything, but it would mean the absolute world to us if you did.", "Bill: Well, i'm going to make you proud. (Laughter)", "billy: You already have.", "Bill: Thanks, uncle josh.", "Josh: You have earned this, okay. Now the lawyers are drawing up the paperwork as we speak.", "Bill: Oh, is that right?", "Josh: And there will be an announcement made later on today. So...", "Bill: So you knew i was going to say yes, is that right?", "Josh: We had a pretty good idea.", "Bill: All right.", "Josh: And don't let the power go to your head. And listen to me now. You watch your back. You're in charge now, so people are going to be coming out of the woodwork to get a piece of you, okay?", "Bill: Look if you want more time to think about it for a second, I completely understand.", "Billy: Wait a second. Do you think it's okay?", "Bill: Okay. All right.", "Billy: It's a done deal, right?", "Bill: You got it.", "Billy: I think our work here is done, brother.", "Bill: Oh, wait minute now. You can't just leave. Let me at least give you some lunch or something. Seal the deal.", "Billy: Lunch?", "Bill: Yeah.", "Billy: He actually thinks he has time for lunch. Does he has time for lunch?", "Josh: No, he doesn't have time for lunch. You're in charge of a big company@7\u00e9W. So go to work, mr. Lewis.", "Billy: You heard the man.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: I know what you're thinking.", "Reva: No, you don't know what i'm thinking. But I do know what i saw the way you looked at marah the night of the valentine's dance.", "Jeffrey: Reva, I've been trying to keep her away. I tried to push her away. I really did.", "Reva: But what? You're tough as nails district attorney was no match for my young daughter? What are you doing, jeffrey?", "Jeffrey: I know. I'm going to have to stay away from her. I'm also going to have to recluse from this case. But not now. Not until I know that she's ready for what's coming up for her. I'm going to stand by her for as long as I can.", "Reva: For her sake or for your own?", "Jeffrey: For both of us.", "Reva: She's... She's in the pool house. Go, please before I change my mind.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marah: You and jeffrey o'neill. I mean i knew you two knew each other, but... I lived with you. How did I not know this?", "Marah: We had a lot of other things that we were dealing with.", "Marina: Yeah, but... Are you two...", "Marah: Are we what?", "Marina: Like in love or anything?", "Marah: Marina.", "Marina: Please. It is such a joy to talk about something other than you know who. Just tell me.", "Marah: It wasn't like that. We had an agreement.", "Marina: What kind of an agreement?", "Marah: Actually, it was more of a contract.", "Marina: A contract. What did you get yourself into, marah?", "Marah: There's no strings attached. You know, whatever happened happened. And we had no obligation to each other.", "Marina: No obligation. Sounds like a cd of the month club.", "Marah: You don't understand. It wasn't easy to do, but it was still good. And now jeffrey has to go back to his job. And I have to face up to what i've done. Maybe... Maybe it could have been different. Maybe he could have cared the way I care for him. I don't know, you know. It doesn't matter anymore.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marina: If you care about him, it matters. (Knock at the door) god, is that one of those stupid reporters?", "Marina: I got it.", "Jeffrey: Is marah here?", "Marina: Yeah, sure. It's him. Lose the slippers. You ready?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marah: Yeah.", "Jeffrey: Hi.", "Marah: Hi. I thought you couldn't see me.", "Jeffrey: You okay?", "Marah: Yeah, I'm fine. I've got my friends and my family. You don't need to worry about me. I'm fine.", "Jeffrey: Well, you know, did it ever occur to you that i might not be.", "Marah: You should go.", "Jeffrey: Yeah, I know... I know i should go. But I can't, marah. I won'T. I need you. We need each other.", "Marah: Why would you want to be with somebody like me?", "Jeffrey: How could you ask me that?", "Marah: Because, jeffrey, i killed somebody.", "Jeffrey: Shh. It's okay.", "Marah: No, no, it's not okay. Gosh, when you're at trial and people confessed that they've killed somebody, do you just tell them that it's okay?", "Jeffrey: That's not you. You're not one of those people.", "Marah: Yes, i am. I became one of those people as soon as I pulled the trigger.", "Jeffrey: No. Listen, you know it's true. When you pull the trigger, when you take a life you can never go back.", "Marah: You know?", "Jeffrey: I know that we all make mistakes, marah. But protecting someone that you love is not a mistake.", "Marah: Is that what you think that i did? Is that what you're doing?", "Jeffrey: Don't put up a wall like i did, okay, to trey to keep out the hurt. That's what carrie wants you to do.", "Marah: Every time i think about her...", "Jeffrey: Don't think about it. Don't even think about what would have happened if you hadn't done what you did.", "Marah: Carrie would still be alive.", "Jeffrey: Someone else might not be. Someone that you love might not be. You might not be.", "Marah: Jeffrey, i know you're not supposed to be here, but can you stay anyway, please.", "Jeffrey: Oh, god, i'll stay as long as you want me to.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Buzz: (Moans)", "bill: Hey, buzz. I didn't even hear the door open.", "Buzz: I came out the back door. I needed some air.", "Bill: Yeah, me, too.", "Buzz: I got a kid in there that has questions and i don't have the answers.", "Bill: I bet she does. I know what happened.", "Buzz: Ah. That's why you have the weight of the world on your shoulders... Thinking about your old man.", "Bill: \"The weight of the world,\" that's about right. You know, I've been filling in over at lewis construction while everything was going on. But now my uncle josh and my dad want me to run the company permanently.\u00f1", "Buzz: Wow. Well, congratulations. Is this the realization of a life long dream.", "Bill: Heck no. I wanted to be a fireman.", "Buzz: Well, i heard that company be putting out some fires.", "Bill: You know, the funny thing is i just never thought i would end up in my hometown running the family business. I always thought i was going to get out there and do something different with my life.", "Buzz: Well, as I recall, you did get out there for awhile. (Laughs) that is the thing about family, isn't it? It just pulls you back whether you want it or not. I guess you just have to take it as a challenge. You got to make your own world. You got to get what you want right there in the middle of the people that know you best. People who, you know, for better for worse, think they know what's best for you, you know what i mean? Keep me posted.", "Bill: Yeah, i will.", "Buzz: I've got to back in there and put out a fire.W3", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "harley: Dad, we need to talk.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Buzz: I want to talk to him. Would you please remind your fianc\u00e9e, a.K.A., My daughter that she is no longer on the police payroll and that her old man has been interrogated enough for one day.", "Gus: Okay. What he said.", "Harley: Would you please tell my father that his daughter has no desire to interrogate him. I just want to prevent some trouble.", "Buzz: Aye.", "Gus: What she said.", "Buzz: What kind of trouble?", "Gus: She's worried about this caruther's chick coming back and doing something from the grave.", "Buzz: She's dead.", "Gus: Exactly.", "Buzz: She's shot. She fell in the river.", "Harley: Dad. She nursed that grudge for years. She planned everything, including her own death. I'm just saying I wouldn't put it past her to have left behind some nightmares to live on after her. You know what they say about revenge.", "Buzz: It's best served cold?", "Harley: Yes. So if carrie is cold and dead in some watery grave, now will be the time to watch our backs.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marina: What do you mean if? Carrie's dead. You told me she was dead. (Knock at the door)", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "reva: Oh, jeffrey, I swear. Joshua.", "Josh: Were you expecting somebody?", "Reva: Jeffrey o'neill again.", "Josh: Again, huh?", "Reva: Yes, he was here to see marah.", "Josh: Ah.", "Reva: I know. I wasn't exactly thrilled about it either. But you know what? I think that we could trust him with our daughter. Besides, she's a grown woman now.", "Josh: (Laughs)", "reva: It's true.", "Josh: I know. I know. And this may sound surprising. But I actually think he's a pretty good guy. Stand up guy, you know.", "Reva: I pretty much said the same thing to him.", "Josh: She saved my life.", "Reva: I know.", "Josh: I just can't believe this is happening to her now. I just... I hate everything about it.", "Reva: I'm worried that it's all just the beginning.", "Josh: And she's not going to go to jail, reva. I promise you that. I'm going to do everything i can to make sure she has the best possible representation in court, i'll talk to the judge, the jury, the press, whoever i have to talk to make sure people understand that this was self defense. And that's actually going to be a pretty full-time job for me. So i thought i'd better tell you that earlier billy and i gave the company over to bill.", "reva: Are you sure? That company has been your life's work.", "Josh: Well, bill is definitely ready. And the company's not my life's work. You are my life work, our children, our kids. That's my life's work.", "Reva: We're a little more high maintenance than the company.", "Josh: Well, that's true, but i like the challenge.", "Reva: You know what the real challenge is going to be? You being a part of this family and still living at the beacon.", "Josh: Yeah. I'm actually glad you brought that up, because i was wondering if--(clears his throat)-- maybe I could leave this here?", "Reva: In the study?", "Josh: Well, wherever you want me to leave it, I guess will be fine. But I...", "Reva: Is that your toothbrush?", "Josh: Yes.", "Reva: I think i can make up the guest room for it. Fresh sheets, towels...", "Josh: No. I'm sorry. That won't work.", "Reva: Oh. I understand. Baby steps.", "Josh: No, no, it's just that i intensely dislike the wallpaper in the guestroom. I was thinking maybe the master bedroom, you know, our room. What do you think about that?", "Reva: Are you sure?", "Josh: Yeah, i'm sure. Eh so i guess this means I can put my toothbrush upstairs.", "Reva: Wait, wait, wait. You know, I love that you want to be a part of this, be here. And I don't want to push, but...", "Josh: But?", "Reva: I don't want to get my hopes up that... That this is something more than just temporary. So if... If you're not planning on moving all the way in, then maybe you should go back to the beacon.P1o", "josh: You want to give me a hand with this stuff? I figured I'd leave it outside until I got the okay on the toothbrush.", "Reva: Oh.", "Josh: What?", "Reva: You're home.", "Josh: Yes.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marina: Carrie's dead. She has to be dead.", "Buzz: She's dead. She's dead. She's dead. Look, she's not going to hurt us or you ever again.", "Marina: But aunt harley just said...", "Buzz: No, no, no. She's just saying that maybe she left a little surprise or something, you know, for everybody after. She's gone.", "Harley: Yeah, right.", "Gus: But don'T...", "Harley: You mean like the cave-in?", "Gus: The what?", "Harley: What cave-in? There was this one time when i was down in the tunnels on my way to carrie's room and the walls collapsed on me.", "Buzz: When did this happen?", "Harley: What?", "Gus: What tunnels?", "Harley: I don't know. It was a while ago. Marah and michelle got me out. We don't know that carrie planned it, but it was right after the razor blade.", "Buzz: The razor blade?", "Harley: What razor blade?", "Marina: You know, the razor blade that was stuck in marah's doll. So when she reached out to get it...", "Buzz: You know about this?", "Marina: We don't know that carrie was involved, but it was all right after the gas leak in michelle's fireplace. And we never ever found out how that happened. So...", "Gus: What gas leak?", "Harley: You still think there's nothing to worry about, dad?", "Buzz: There is nothing to worry about.", "Gus: Well, there's nothing to worry about because there's no real proof. So let's just calm down.", "Harley: The proof is in the setups. The proof is in the traps. Look at it.", "Buzz: Hey, could you get me a cream soda?", "Marina: No, i want to hear this. What do you think carrie has planned?", "Harley: I don't know. Maybe nothing, okay. But when you see everything else, I... I wouldn't put it past her to have left behind some surprises.", "Marina: So what are we going to do about it?", "Harley: We're not doing anything about it. Marina, you're out of this.", "Marina: So what are you going to do about it?", "Harley: I'm going to protect my family. T(", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "jeffrey: Take a nap. Okay, I'll go.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marah: No. Can you stay? At least until i fall asleep?", "Jeffrey: Sure.", "Marah: Thank you.", "Jeffrey: What?", "Marah: I was just thinking. I used to have a stuffed bear that i slept with when i was little.", "Jeffrey: Really?", "Marah: Mm-hmm. I called him, mr. Bear.", "Jeffrey: That's very original.", "Marah: None of the girls my age could have handled a bear like him.", "Jeffrey: And why is that?", "Marah: Because he looked ferocious. But I knew better.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Josh: Thank you so much for your help. I appreciate that.", "Reva: So I guess it's too late for me to change my mind.", "Josh: Oh, no, you can change your mind. It's just that if you do that, you're the one who's going to have to go upstairs and haul all of my bags downstairs.", "Reva: Oh, no. No, no, no.", "Josh: (Laughs)", "reva: That's too much work. You can stay.", "Josh: Yeah?", "Reva: Mm-hmm. Joshua?", "Josh: Hmm?", "Reva: Don't ever walk out that door again. The kids need you. And I need you.", "Josh: I'm not going anywhere. You know, when you're in jail you get a lot of time to think about things.", "Reva: (Laughs) I remember.", "Josh: Yeah, i'm sure you do. And I thought a lot about our family. About how much you mean to me and how much the kids mean to me and how we are going to... We're going to get through this thing and we're going to do it together.", "Reva: Oh, hello. Must have left it open to crack on the last trip. What do you want?", "Josh: I have everything that i want right here. So why don't you come back over here and have a seat with? Reva? What is it?", "Reva: You're home now. And that's all the matters.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cop: You have a visitor.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marah: Jeffrey?
