Well, you don't have to answer me now. You could wait until later if you feel like it. \nGus: No, no. Just... you got a busy day at the office? \nAlan: I'm not going to the office. I'm going down to try to cut a deal with jeffrey o'neill. You look surprised. \nGus: No, I just think it's good that you're going to take the high road, you know? \nAlan: More like saving my own skin, don't you think? \nGus: No, no. You're the deal maker. You're cutting a deal. \nAlan: More like saving spaulding a major headache. Also getting the da to keep us out of the line of fire. Also, we're going to root out the source of these misappropriated funds. \nGus: Exactly. You got rats in the building? Smoke them out; that's what i say. \nAlan: I think he's going to want to open up all the records, find out our trade secrets. \nGus: Well, if I can, I think this is what you should do. I think you should cut him off at the pass, you know, and tell him everything that you know right now. Just make it seem important and painful, and I think he'll be happy. That's just my opinion. I'm going to... \nAlan: Gus? I could use your help today... moral support, if you can spare any. I realize you can't be my son in this circumstance, but perhaps you could be a part of my legal staff. \nGus: What, you want me to dust off my law degree? \nAlan: That would mean a lot to me. \nGus: Yeah, yeah. Sure, let's do it. \nAlan: (Laughs) ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: No, I ordered a soda. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Waitress: It's from mrs. Spaulding.

May I sit? \nBill: Well, how are you? \nOlivia: Oh, you know, I'm hanging in. \nBill: Phillip? \nOlivia: Doing as well as can be expected. I'm just trying to keep things running smoothly. \nBill: I'll bet. \nOlivia: So I guess we're going to be spending a lot of time together in the near future. With you running lewis construction and me at spaulding, we're bound to cross. \nBill: You think? Spaulding-lewis collaborations haven't been so successful in the past. \nOlivia: Maybe it's time to change that. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nurse: Anything else, mr. Spaulding? \nPhillip: Did they forget my dinner? \nNurse: Mr. Spaulding, you just had lunch. \nPhillip: I'm still hungry. \nNurse: Okay, I'll see what i can do. \nRick: Hey, nurse? How's mr. Spaulding doing? \nNurse: Uh, today is not one of his better days. \nRick: Thank you. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Sounds like you got some big plans for spaulding. \nOlivia: Well, yeah. Without a plan. \nBill: I guess not. It must be tough to make a place for yourself over there, being a new wife, husband in the hospital. \nOlivia: Mm-hmm. Well, that's why I have to plunge in, you know? Protect my husband's interest. \nBill: Hm. Well, I'm sure phillip's dad and his aunt alex will be looking out after things, too. \nOlivia: Come on. You know those two. \nBill: Well, not all that well, actually. \nOlivia: Well enough to know they're not exactly the \"all for one, one for all\" lewises, right? \nBill: Well, I guess not, but I'm sure they look out after each other in their own special way. \nOlivia: My, you're very diplomatic. \nBill: Yeah, well. \nOlivia: Look, I don't want to talk about those old fossils, because I'm excited about the future. \nBill: Hm. \nOlivia: I hope you are, too. \nBill: Well, sometimes. I just didn't expect everything to fall in my lap at once. \nOlivia: You're more than ready for this, bill. \nBill: It's a big company. \nOlivia: So what? They'll still be there for you, your uncle and your dad. \nBill: Well, sure. My dad's still the oil man, an uncle josh will help out when he can. \nOlivia: I give them a lot of credit for knowing when to hand it over. \nBill: What? \nOlivia: Oh, come on. They needed some fresh blood in that stodgy old company. Look, I've been reading everything that you've been doing. I even went to the development on the north side of the lake. It's beautiful. It's classy but affordable. \nBill: (Laughs) really? You know, companies like spaulding and lewis last for generations. Do you$want to know why? Because they take their time. They build brick by brick. Hb, brandon, my dad, josh... \nOlivia: Oh, no, not the history lecture. I'm kidding. I'm not trashing them. It's just that I feel like you're a little hesitant or guilty about all this, and you can't be. You have to enjoy this, okay? So here's to you, the new head of lewis construction; and me, the devoted wife to a hardworking executive, okay?

Hey. \nPhillip: Hey. \nRick: I had a few minutes off from work, so I thought I'd come by and see you. Some magazines. \nPhillip: Come by and check me out? \nRick: Come by and see you. \nPhillip: Well, in that case, you'll be happy to know I'm doing great. \nRick: Well, that's great, pal. That's really... that's really good. Listen, I was really hoping that you'd get out of here in time to, well, you know... \nPhillip: Oh. When mel has the baby. \nRick: Right. Should I have not brought that up? \nPhillip: You just did. \nRick: Well, I know. I just want to make sure, i mean, are you okay with it?\nPhillip: With your happiness? \nRick: Yeah. \nPhillip: Of course I am. \nRick: Well, that's good, buddy, because it's really important for mel and I that you're a big part of our baby's life. \nPhillip: I feel the same way about you being a part of emma's life. \nRick: Emma? \nPhillip: My baby with olivia: Emma. \nRick: Right. \nPhillip: Looks like our kids are going to grow up together after all, go to school, everything-- just like we hoped. \nRick: Phillip, you're not dealing with this. \nPhillip: With what? \nRick: The child that you had with olivia died, buddy. \nPhillip: Rick, if that were true, don't you think I would know? \nRick: Right. \nPhillip: Running away? \nRick: No, actually. As I said, I just had a few minutes to see how you're doing, and I've really got to get back to work. \nPhillip: Hm. See you soon? \nRick: Absolutely. Absolutely. Nurse? Have dr. Langham call dr.

I told you to go to paris. \nAlexandra: I am not leaving you alone, not anywhere. Especially not in a police station. I'm concerned for both of us right now. \nAlan: Funny thing about families: They fight like pit bulls, but when someone else throws a shot at us, we remember where our bloodlines lay. \nAlexandra: Does that include your newfound son, dear? \nAlan: I think gus will protect me where he can. \nAlexandra: And just how is gus in any position to protect you? \nAlan: He's been working for the feds. \nAlexandra: (Gasps) \nAlan: He's been working undercover at spaulding to protect me from anything they might find. \nAlexandra: God. And you believe him? Dear god, alan. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: You're kidding me. Come on, that is not the deal. That is not what I told him. \nJeffrey: That's the way it's got to go, gus. \nGus: Look, the only reason he's come down here to deal with you in the first place is because he trusts me. \nJeffrey: Yeah, he trusts you. \nGus: He trusts me, yeah, to protect him. \nJeffrey: That's exactly why you have to do this. If I start asking him questions, he's going to get his backup, he's going to get defensive, and we're not going to find out anything that we can use, okay? You're the one he trusts; you're the one that can trip him up. I'm sorry, but that's the way we're going to do it. \nGus: I like the way that you keep using the word \"we.\" \nJeffrey: Well, I'm going to be right there with you. \nGus: Oh, are you going to be right there with me? When I watch my relationship with my father go down the drain? \nJeffrey: This is an important cause, okay? Try to remember that, okay?

We're going to go into our meeting now. You, alexandra, are going to go home, and I will call you later. \nAlexandra: All right. \nLawyer: Alan, are you sure you want to do this? I mean, we don't know what to expect in there. \nAlan: That's why I have you and my son. A little extra legal mind might come in handy. \nLawyer: I don't think that's the wisest idea, alan. Do you understand what's going to happen in there? \nAlan: No, but whatever happens, I accept full responsibility. I am to blame for maryanne caruthers' death. And it must be made clear that none of the other four gentlemen with me that night are to blame, or this deal is off. Hey. I'm sorry that alexandra hit you. \nGus: Oh, please. I don't give A... I don'T... what you're doing is good, okay? It's a good thing. It's good. \nAlan: I'm glad you approve. It's the only way I can make amends for that woman's death.

We'll dance later. In the event that your client should supply information to us which might expose him to criminal liability in any case... \nLawyer: Any case? \nGus: Alan is going to get immunity, okay? That's what we're here for. He's going to get immunity for giving access to spaulding pharmaceuticals, along with all other related entities, right? \nAlan: Wait, wait, wait. What? \nLawyer: \"All related entities\"? \nAlan: \"Related\" sounds like the entire company, gus. I think you've misspoken. I never agreed to... what's going on here? \nGus: You're going to have to give everything, alan. Records, contracts, e-mails... everything in the company. Everything. \nAlan: Hand over my entire company to the feds? \nGus: Every single receipt. Everything. \nAlan: Or what? \nGus: Or your life is going to take a turn for the worse, all right?

Just tell us why. \nAlan: Because I paid very little attention to that area. \nLawyer: Alan. \nAlan: Because I am not interested. I gave that division to alexandra to keep her busy.

Why? \nLawyer: Detective, alan is trying to cooperate. You are the one that is being difficult. \nGus: Can you just close your mouth for a minute? Look, you're screwing me here, okay? There's a deal on the table. We know what you're doing, we know what's going on, so if you want the deal... I've got to hear the words come out of your mouth, alan. You've got to speak the words now, or forever lose your deal. \nAlan: I came here today in good faith with information about spaulding pharmaceuticals in exchange for a break in what happened with maryanne caruthers.\nGus: Yes.

We know about that. We know about the missing shipments that are being diverted. And we know that that is being used to create a street drug called delirium, okay.

Are you accusing alexandra and me of being drug dealers? Do you honestly believe that you come up from a family of drug dealers? \nGus: Honestly, alan, I don't know. Right now, I could. I don't know. \nAlan: You son of A... you know what? I could swallow... I swallow your working undercover at spaulding without telling me. And I could buy your trying to protect me, gus.

Why don't we talk in the hall? I'll be back, phillip. \nPhillip: Olivia. Tell them. Please. \nOlivia: I really am sorry.

Maybe he shouldn't be around a lot of people right now. \nLizzie: Why would that make a difference? \nOlivia: I think you're really out of your depth here, lizzie. \nLizzie: No, not when it comes to my dad, I'm not. \nBeth: Okay, lizzie.
