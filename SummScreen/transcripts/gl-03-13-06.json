        "Alan-Michael: Marina, hey, Marina.",
        "Marina: Quiet, sh-sh-sh. Oh, my gosh. Is that-- Alan-Michael, I cannot believe that you above all people still listen to Milli Vanilli. ( Laughs )",
        "Alan-Michael: Sure.",
        "Marina: No.",
        "Alan-Michael: Hey.",
        "Marina: ( Laughs )",
        "Alan-Michael: So what? I've still got a couple of years on you?",
        "Marina: Oh, yeah? Did you have the hair, too, you know all heavily moussed and gelled?",
        "Alan-Michael: No.",
        "Marina: Yes, you did. Oh, you so did! I can see it now! You got on the mousse...",
        "Alan-Michael: All right, all right. I was heavily influenced by a flock of seagulls. And I've always been willing to do and wear whatever it takes to get the job done.",
        "Marina: And what kind of job is that?",
        "Alan-Michael: To keep the right people bored.",
        "Marina: Am I the right kind of people?",
        "Alan-Michael: Are you the right kind of people? Could be.",
        "Marina: That's why I love you. ( Gasps ) No, I mean, I didn't mean it. Oh, hell, yes, I did. I do. Don't panic. No, see, it just popped out. You know, I don't expect you to reciprocate.",
        "Alan-Michael: Marina, I...",
        "Marina: Don't, don't, okay? Forget I even said it. I know, we've not even been dating that long. I just... I mean, there are so many things that I do love about you. I'm not going to lie about that. Come on, it's not a big deal. Okay, it's okay.",
        "Alan-Michael: There is something I need to say. I just don't think you're gonna like it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: So Tammy, where did Jonathan go last night? Were you with him? Tammy!",
        "Tammy: Who took the call from Sandy? Are you sure it was him?",
        "Frank: We found Sandy's cell phone at Fox Cliff-- that's where he said Jonathan was threatening him. And I'm confident it was Sandy making the call.",
        "Tammy: He wasn't there? You didn't find anything?",
        "Frank: No, we didn't find anything. We didn't find Jonathan; we didn't find Sandy. And guess what? That doesn't look good. So Tammy, I'm just going to ask you one more time: Where did Jonathan go last night?",
        "Jonathan: I'd do anything for you, you know that, right? I want us to be able to walk out of here and not have to look over our shoulders. Trust me, you never have to worry about Sandy anymore.",
        "Tammy: Nowhere. Jonathan was with me all night. Right here in this room. He just left ten minutes ago to go get us some food. You see Jonathan couldn't have been with Sandy last night. It's not possible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Would you call me, please, I'm worried about you.",
        "Josh: Jonathan again?",
        "Reva: Yeah. I just can't imagine where he and Tammy could be. You know what? Maybe he's checked back in at Outskirts.",
        "Josh: Actually, you know what? There's only one person you should be worried about right now, and that's you.",
        "Reva: I'm fine. It's a little headache.",
        "Josh: Reva, there's nothing little about a headache that won't go away and was caused by a near fatal accident.",
        "Reva: You know what? You're all doom and gloom, aren't you? Oh come on, you don't seriously think there's something wrong with me.",
        "Josh: I think there's a lot wrong with you, Reva, but, then again, there always has been.",
        "Reva: And you love it.",
        "Josh: I'll tell you what, I'm kind of thinking that they're done with your blood testing, so I'm going to go find somebody to harass. I'll be back.",
        "Reva: Hey.",
        "Josh: Yes.",
        "Reva: Thanks for being here.",
        "Josh: Oh-oh-oh. You know what? This is not a good time. If you want to see Reva, why don't you wait until she gets back to the hotel.",
        "Billy: Reva's in there?",
        "Josh: Yes.",
        "Billy: What's wrong?",
        "Josh: There's nothing wrong. I just don't think that this... this is a good time to see her.",
        "Reva: You know I think I can make that decision all by myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Ready to go?",
        "Alan: What do you think? Is there something wrong, Beth?",
        "Beth: No, I just can't help feeling that we're forgetting something. Maybe it's just...",
        "Alan: It's okay. Let me worry about Gus.",
        "Beth: Did you hear that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: I hear something. No, listen, listen, listen. Be a cop first, okay? You cover the front; I'll go around back.",
        "Harley: I don't care what you cover, I'm going in.",
        "Alan: Harley...",
        "Beth: Harley...",
        "Alan: What a surprise?",
        "Harley: Oh, my God. Where is he? Gus? Where is he? Where is he? I know he's here! Gus? Gus? Gus?",
        "Beth: Harley, calm down.",
        "Harley: Calm down? You're telling me to calm down. You're standing there with your husband! We declared him legally dead! Gus?",
        "Mallet: All right, if he's not here, then where is he? Where is he?",
        "Harley: Where is he, Alan?!",
        "Alan: Harley, I'm sorry.",
        "Harley: Sorry for what?!",
        "Beth: Gus didn't make it.",
        "Harley: What do you mean? What?",
        "Alan: There was a storm, an accident, we were both hurt.",
        "Harley: No, no, no, no.",
        "Alan: There was a blizzard. I almost died, Harley.",
        "Harley: No, no.",
        "Alan: I know how you feel. He was my son.",
        "Harley: You don't know how I feel! And I don't care what you say, okay? I don't believe one word. You survived, and he didn't? No. Where is he?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Look, let's... let's just forget that I said anything, okay. We'll go do something fun, like bungee jump off the terrace.",
        "Alan-Michael: I've been worried.",
        "Marina: I know you've been worried.",
        "Alan-Michael: Listen to me. I really like being with you. We've had some great times. You always make me smile, but...",
        "Marina: But...",
        "Alan-Michael: But I just think we're moving too fast. Saying what you just said proves it. That's why I feel it would be best for both of us if we just end it, before someone gets hurt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I'm glad you're here. How are you holding up?",
        "Billy: Well, I'm hanging in there. Look, Josh said it might not be a good time for you to socialize.",
        "Reva: Josh is an old worry- wart. I'm not on a ventilator; I'm fine. And seeing Billy is not going to hurt me.",
        "Josh: Yeah-- Reva, Billy's the reason that you're here.",
        "Billy: Hey, look, I know what I did was wrong and I know drinking and driving was wrong-- especially letting her get in the car. I tried to atone by turning myself in and being responsible--",
        "Josh: Yeah, I know and I probably should have left you in that jail cell, that's--",
        "Billy: Hey, you want a note for the bail money, is that it?",
        "Josh: No, I just... you know, if I had my way...",
        "Reva: Oh, hey. Come on! Stop, please, both of you. I'm fine.",
        "Billy: You couldn't make me feel any sorrier than I feel right now.",
        "Josh: Yeah, but you're always sorry after the fact, Billy; see, that's a problem.",
        "Reva: All right, it's enough. Please...",
        "Josh: Reva, I'm sorry, it's just...",
        "Reva: It's enough!",
        "Josh: Every time I close my eyes, I'm back at the scene of the accident, you're on the ground, you're not breathing--",
        "Reva: Okay, I'm fine. I really am. We can get out of here right now.",
        "Josh: What is it, what's wrong?",
        "Reva: Nothing. Billy and I had an accident; I got knocked down, but I'm back on my feet again. I have ten fingers and ten toes. It's done; it's over. Can we please move on to something a little more constructive?",
        "Billy: Darling, I'm sorry about the accident, I am. When you were unconscious there, I...",
        "Reva: I know. And I'm glad you're okay. And Josh is glad you're okay, too.",
        "Josh: I'm not-- I don't even know that you are okay, Billy. You look a little rough around the edges.",
        "Billy: Yeah, well I'm stone sober.",
        "Josh: Why are you here?",
        "Billy: To go to an AA meeting downstairs, okay? You going to be all right?",
        "Reva: I'm going to be fine.",
        "Billy: Good. If you need me, I'll be downstairs confessing.",
        "Reva: Why are you so hard on him? He's hard enough on himself.",
        "Josh: I'm going to go find the nurse to see if we can get you out of here, okay.",
        "Reva: Good. You know what? Getting out of here is a great thing, but I'm not going back to the hotel.",
        "Josh: Why not?",
        "Reva: Because I'm going to stay at the house tonight.",
        "Josh: No, Reva, we talked about this already. It's not a good idea for you to be at the house alone.",
        "Reva: Who said I'm going to be at the house alone?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: So Jonathan didn't go out for anything last night?",
        "Tammy: Nope.",
        "Frank: He didn't leave here for any other reason?",
        "Tammy: He went to get some ice. But I watched him.",
        "Frank: Come on, Tammy, he went out to get ice?",
        "Tammy: I'm telling you the truth.",
        "Frank: So you never left his side?",
        "Tammy: How many times do I have to tell you, Frank? No.",
        "Frank: Then why did Sandy call the police?",
        "Tammy: Isn't it obvious? He's up to something.",
        "Frank: What?",
        "Tammy: I don't know what. But before I came here, Sandy lured me down to the docks and had this whole creepy wedding thing planned.",
        "Frank: Why would he do that?",
        "Tammy: Because he wants me back and he hates Jonathan.",
        "Frank: Well I think we know that.",
        "Tammy: Sandy's probably trying to get you to think that Jonathan did something to him.",
        "Frank: You're saying that you think Sandy set up Jonathan? And you're sure you never left his side?",
        "Tammy: I told you everything I know, Frank. I don't have anything else to say.",
        "Frank: Tammy. Tammy, listen to me, I'm trying to help you here; I'm you're friend. What are you so afraid of?",
        "Tammy: I'm not afraid.",
        "Frank: All right, I just got a couple more questions for you...",
        "Tammy: No, no more questions. I'll tell Jonathan that you dropped by and I'm sure he'll be thrilled to once again prove that he's completely innocent. Have a good night",
        "Frank: Okay, you do the same. But when you see Jonathan, tell him I want to talk to him, all right. And let's hope that the next time we see Sandy it's not in a body bag.",
        "Jonathan: Because there's nothing stopping us anymore.",
        "Tammy: You went after Sandy, didn't you? God, what did you do? I don't care what happened out there, what you did and where you went, as long as you're here now and okay. That's all that matters. Nothing else matters. Jonathan, pick up, please. ( Sighs ) Fox Cliff.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Come on. Laugh! This is a joke, right? You're going to end whatever this is that we have because I said the \"L\" word?",
        "Alan-Michael: No, it's not just what you said.",
        "Marina: This is why you jump around from bed to bed, huh? Some woman says I love your hair or I love your eyes and you're on the next jet to Paris. Well, stop, okay? So I spoke too soon; I jumped the gun. Let's just... let's forget about it and eat.",
        "Alan-Michael: Marina, it's not just what you said. It felt great, believe me. It's us, the future. This was never going to work; we both know that.",
        "Marina: No. You see, I didn't know that.",
        "Alan-Michael: If I was capable of loving someone right now, it would be you. You're the purest person I've ever met in my life. You're beautiful; you're sweet, you bring out the best in me. If you were anyone else...",
        "Marina: No, you knew who I was when you asked me out, Alan-Michael, when you flew me to Europe.",
        "Alan-Michael: You also knew who I was, Marina. But we both decided to look the other way and pretend we were the ones who could break the curse.",
        "Marina: The curse? ( Laughs ) Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Waiter, can I get some garlic? You are nuts.",
        "Alan-Michael: Maybe, I don't know. I care about you, Marina.",
        "Marina: Oh, you care.",
        "Alan-Michael: You know I would wind up hurting you, you know that. Let me save you the pain.",
        "Marina: I'm sorry. Where did you get that, the back of a cereal box? It's kind of lame.",
        "Alan-Michael: Good-bye, Marina.",
        "Marina: This is it?",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm sorry.",
        "Marina: Good-bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Harley, Gus died trying to save my life. Now, I know that it is hard for you to believe, given the way this all started.",
        "Harley: A little too hard to believe.",
        "Alan: We were both injured, he more than I. His leg was bleeding. It was very mangled, but we tried to get through the woods to find help, but we could hardly see. That's when he realized that he was on the ice.",
        "Harley: And you survived?",
        "Alan: He fell through, Harley. I took off my coat to try to save him, but I only had one good arm and he went under. With what strength I had left, I tried-- I tried to get through the woods and find this cabin.",
        "Beth: And this is where I found him. Sick, injured, grieving Gus's death.",
        "Alan: When I came to, I realized that I had lost another son.",
        "Harley: No, no. You shut up. You both shut up. You start from the beginning, okay? Gus picked you up at the courthouse; he was in the limousine. What happened next?",
        "Alan: He was driving like a crazy man, swirling from side to side. He told me he was going to keep me until I confessed killing Phillip, and then he was going to lock me away forever. He said he was doing this to protect you.",
        "Harley: Keep going.",
        "Alan: Well, we came to a curve in the road; he took it wide, and that's when we crashed through the barrier. When I came to, he was shaking me. The rest of the story you know.",
        "Mallet: That's a great story, Alan.",
        "Beth: It's not a story.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I think it is, Beth. So you're telling me that you've been here with a dying man. Did you call a doctor? Did you call paramedics? See, it doesn't add up. Something is missing here. And you know what it is? Gus.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Tammy. Tammy?",
        "Frank: I just talked to her a few minutes ago. She must have gone out.",
        "Jonathan: Great, what do you want?",
        "Frank: What do I want? I want the truth about what you did to Sandy Foster. You know you have the right to remain silent, but personally, I'd advise against it.",
        "Jonathan: I warned you to stay away from Tammy; you wouldn't listen to me.",
        "Sandy: What are you going to do, kill me? I see what you've got.",
        "Jonathan: Whoa!",
        "Sandy: Hey. Help me, help me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie Gatschet, \"Inside The Light.\" Jonathan means excitement and danger and all of those things that Tammy never really saw herself wanting, but now that she's had it and now that they're together, it's like he's the most important thing in the world to her. Jonathan is definitely the right guy for Tammy. Thank you to all of the fans. \"Guiding light\" has the most unbelievably supportive fans that I could ever imagine. See Tammy, Wednesday, March 15th, \"Inside The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Sandy.",
        "Sandy: Whoa, whoa. Hey, be careful.",
        "Tammy: I thought... the police said that you. I thought you were...",
        "Sandy: Murdered by our buddy Jonathan.",
        "Tammy: Are you the one that called the police?",
        "Sandy: Can't you just be happy I'm alive?",
        "Tammy: There was no fight, was there?",
        "Sandy: But you thought there was. Isn't that the point?",
        "Tammy: You were just, what, here the whole time watching, weren't you?",
        "Sandy: Okay, okay, I did what I had to do because I love you. ( Sighs ) That's why I do it all. Because I'm the one who loves you.",
        "Tammy: You're hurting my arm.",
        "Sandy: I don't want to hurt you. Jonathan's dangerous. He is the one that wants to hurt you. I have to save you from him. Don't you understand that?",
        "Tammy: I do, I understand, I understand, Sandy. You're right, you're right. Jonathan, he's out of control, he can't help himself. That's why we have to get out of here tonight before something happens.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: It's a crock. Sandy's trying to make it look like I did something. I would love to push him off a cliff, but I didn't do it.",
        "Frank: We found his cell phone at the cliff.",
        "Jonathan: Where's the body?",
        "Frank: There is no body yet.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, right, so I have the body? Feel free, Frank. You know, you could check under the bed or in the bathroom, whatever. You're not going to find anything because it is a setup.",
        "Frank: Well, you know what? I'm going to ask you the exact same thing I asked Tammy. Where did you go last night?",
        "Jonathan: You talked to Tammy about this?",
        "Frank: Of course I talked to her.",
        "Jonathan: Well, where did she go?",
        "Frank: I don't know. About last night...",
        "Jonathan: No, forget about last night. I've got to find Tammy.",
        "Frank: Not until we're finished.",
        "Jonathan: We are finished.",
        "Frank: Sanchez! Why don't you offer this gentleman a nice seat here while I go down and get the evidence kit?",
        "Jonathan: Frank, come on, I've got to get out of here. I've got to find Tam...",
        "Sanchez: Later, dude. Just relax.",
        "Jonathan: All right, fine. You know what? I did it; I kicked Sandy Foster off that cliff. I'm only going to tell you this once. His wallet is right over there on that desk. Right there. Look.",
        "Sanchez: Hold on a second.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Because I knew that this is what you would do. You would try to blame Alan for Gus's death. I was merely trying to protect my husband until we could figure out what to do.",
        "Harley: You protected him? You protected him? After you testified in court that he was unstable...",
        "Beth: I never said that he was unstable. I said he needed more time. And let's not forget, Gus was the one who kidnapped Alan, Gus crashed the car, and Gus died. I'm sorry.",
        "Harley: No. No, because I... I have this feeling in my gut that you're pulling the wool over my eyes here. I know it, I can feel it.",
        "Alan: Harley, I know this is hard for you to believe. It is for me, too, especially since I consider it my fault. I am responsible once again. It's all me.",
        "Mallet: What do you mean, it was all you, Alan? What does that mean?",
        "Alan: I was angry at Gus, angry because he gave Harley the keys to Spaulding. I wanted to hurt him. I made threats. Instead of hurting him, all I did was push him right over the edge.",
        "Beth: Alan, Alan, Gus died in an accident, a tragic accident...",
        "Alan: No. No, no. I am responsible, Beth, and I will have to live the rest of my life... Harley, you're going to have to accept this. Your husband and my son is gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Wanda... Wanda, Wanda, I'm hanging up now because I'm not supposed to be talking on the cell phone here in the first place, okay? Good-bye. Sorry about that. I guess your headache's not going away, is it?",
        "Reva: No. I'm just thinking about Jonathan... you know, I'm thinking that maybe Jonathan could help me at the house.",
        "Josh: Reva, that's such a bad idea. I'm sorry, but Jonathan can't even take care of himself. You would be much safer with me at the hotel where I can keep an on you. In fact, you'll be safer any place other than being taken care of by Jonathan.",
        "Reva: I guess it's on to plan \"B.\"",
        "Josh: What is plan \"B\"?",
        "Reva: Billy, you're on time.",
        "Billy: The meeting was canceled.",
        "Josh: The meeting was canceled?",
        "Billy: Yeah, a big sign on the door saying the meeting was canceled. Why don't you go check it out? Are you okay?",
        "Reva: Yes. Yes, I'm fine. Actually, I need you to do something for me. I want to get out of here. I want to go back to the house tonight, and I want you to come with me.",
        "Billy: Yeah, I'll help you out. I'll help you every day next week if you need to.",
        "Reva: Well, no, no, no. I'm talking about you moving in with me. You can have Marah or Shayne's room. You just pick whatever one...",
        "Josh and Billy: What!?",
        "Reva: Yeah. Part of Billy's struggle with sobriety is the fact that he's alone all the time. That accident did a number on you; you need to heal. So you come with me, we'll heal at my place. We'll play poker; we'll watch those old war movies that you like to watch so much.",
        "Billy: I don't think this is a good idea.",
        "Reva: What? After all these years, you don't think you can handle me?",
        "Billy: Darling, I'm... I'm... I'm afraid you can't handle me.",
        "Reva: Well, I'll take my chances. And if you don't say yes, I'm going to hound you until you do.",
        "Billy: Yes.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) Oh, we're gonna have a wild old time, Billy boy!",
        "Billy: Well, that's what I'm afraid of.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs )",
        "Billy: Okay, um... all right, I'll see you later.",
        "Reva: Okay. ( Chuckles )",
        "Josh: You're moving in with Billy?",
        "Reva: No, actually, he's moving in with me.",
        "Josh: You want Billy to take care of you?",
        "Reva: We're going to take care of each other. Do you have a problem with that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: I don't believe this. I won't.",
        "Beth: Harley, I know that it's hard to accept. Believe me, I was dreading you finding out the truth. I'm sorry. Alan, we need to get you to the hospital.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, you can go to the hospital, but we're not finished.",
        "Beth: Harley, one more thing: I want you to know that I always liked Gus. Ooh.",
        "Alan: Are you all right?",
        "Beth: Uh... I'm not sure.",
        "Alan: We're going to get you to the doctor, too. Harley, I want you to know that Gus didn't suffer.",
        "Harley: That doesn't help. I don't understand this. When I saw Alan standing there... he was supposed to be here, too. He was supposed to be grinning that stupid grin and smoking his cigarettes, and saying, \"Hey, Coop, where you been? Where you been?\" \"Where have I been?\"",
        "Mallet: That would have been sweet. Hey, that would have been perfect.",
        "Harley: Look at me. He is just not coming back, is he?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: So glad you could make it. Now, let's get something straight, pal. You don't break up with me. I break up with you. You know, after Danny, it's my time. So that's it. We're through. Don't you ever call me again.",
        "Alan-Michael: Wait, wait. You... you came all the way here to tell me that?",
        "Marina: Well, that, and to tell you what you'd be missing out on. You see, I'm... I'm fun, unpredictable. I know how to keep a relationship exciting. I can go to Vegas at the drop of a hat while at the same time, I can stay home and catch a football game on tv. I happen to look great in a bikini, or out of a bikini. And no man has ever, ever been sorry he dated me because I give really great support. And all this could have been yours. All I asked in return was that you were willing to have as much fun as I was. But it moved too fast for you. You didn't want anyone to get hurt. Well, I'm sorry you couldn't keep it up, pal, all right? You blew it. You can kiss it all good- bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I asked Billy to stay with me because that's what he needs right now. He needs family. He needs to be able to talk to people who love him and not talk to the walls. I want him to be able to reach out to me and not reach for a bottle. Now, why is that a problem?",
        "Josh: Because it's more than that for him, Reva, and you know it.",
        "Reva: Okay, he talked about some things after the accident, but he was upset, he was emotional.",
        "Josh: Okay, Reva, honey, this is a bad idea, okay?",
        "Reva: It's not my first, and it won't be my last. He needs me, and he needs you. And we both know how much you like to be needed.",
        "Josh: You and Billy living in the house together?",
        "Reva: There's plenty of room.",
        "Josh: Yeah, yeah, I remember the layout of that house. Thank you for reminding me. Just... okay, you're right.",
        "Reva: I'm glad. About?",
        "Josh: About need and about the size of the house.",
        "Reva: Okay.",
        "Josh: So I'm going to move into the house with both of you.",
        "Reva: What?",
        "Josh: Somebody needs to be the stabilizing factor in that house, Reva.",
        "Reva: I don't think that's you anymore, Joshua.",
        "Josh: Yeah, well, compared to you and Billy, I'm the rock of Gibraltar.",
        "Reva: You want the three of us to live together?",
        "Josh: What could possibly go wrong? I'm going to go find your nurse, okay? ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Reva: Hello?",
        "Frank: Reva, it's Frank. We need to talk about your son. This time he's gone over the edge.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Wait, wait. Did you just say you wanted to go away with me?",
        "Tammy: I have been so stupid. When Frank Cooper told me what happened out here, I thought for sure that Jonathan had killed you, and I was afraid. That's why I'm here. Thank God you're alive, Sandy. Thank God.",
        "Sandy: Everything I did was for your own good.",
        "Tammy: I know. And when I heard that Jonathan might have hurt you, you know, all I could think about was who would be next? I can't live like that. I can't. I need to be with somebody that I can trust.",
        "Sandy: Uh-huh.",
        "Tammy: Someone like you.",
        "Sandy: I know, and I'm so sorry that finding out about Ava hurt you. And all I've wanted to do since then is to make you trust me, to make it right.",
        "Tammy: I know that now. You've always been good to me, Sandy, and patient, and I've been unfair to you, because, I guess... I guess I was angry, so, do you forgive me?",
        "Sandy: Of course I do. I would do just about anything for you, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: Then take me away. Before Jonathan shows up. Let's get in your car and go.",
        "Sandy: Okay, where?",
        "Tammy: Someplace we can start over.",
        "Sandy: Well, Tammy, can I ask you before we go, do you love me?",
        "Tammy: You used to be my best friend.",
        "Sandy: Well, guess what, buttercup? I still am.",
        "Tammy: Then I guess you have your answer. So come on.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy!",
        "Sandy: She wants to be with me.",
        "Tammy: Sandy's right. You need to go. I don't want you to fight. I don't want to see you...",
        "Sandy: Don't want to see him what? Throw me off a cliff and go to prison? Are you protecting him?",
        "Tammy: No.",
        "Jonathan: What... what is he talking about? What are you talking about?",
        "Sandy: Wait, wait. Wait. He's the dangerous, out-of-control one who wants to hurt you. You still want him, don't you? You... you want me to be violent with you, don't you? You want him...",
        "Tammy: Stop it!",
        "Sandy: We're going off the edge. Get back! I'll take her.",
        "Jonathan: Sandy, stop!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: I just broke up with you. Get out.",
        "Alan-Michael: This is my office. You get out.",
        "Marina: Okay, fine. I'm going.",
        "Alan-Michael: Good-bye, Marina.",
        "Marina: Good-bye, Alan-Michael.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: There's... there's nothing there.",
        "Harley: Sorry. I can't believe I let myself believe he could still be alive.",
        "Mallet: All right, come on. Let's go back to town, eh?",
        "Harley: But Alan is... still alive. That's the last person I'd want back from the dead if you ask me. Yeah, let's get out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: So Reva is cleared then. She can go home.",
        "Nurse: After I check with the doctor. He may want to run a few more tests.",
        "Alan: Josh.",
        "Josh: Alan. You look very fit for a dead guy.",
        "Alan: Well thank you very much.",
        "Josh: Sure.",
        "Beth: We might as well take a seat. I'll get the doctor.",
        "Alan: Wait a minute. You're the one that I'm worried about. After all, you're carrying our child. That is why Gus must never been found. The future of our family depends on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Frank, you're scaring me. What are you talking about?",
        "Frank: Sandy Foster's disappearance is beginning to look like Jonathan is the reason for it.",
        "Reva: No, you have to have that wrong.",
        "Frank: Then why did he knock out one of my cops trying to avoid being questioned about it?",
        "Reva: Frank, let me talk to Jonathan. Is he there?",
        "Frank: No, he's not. He just made a run for it.",
        "Reva: Where are you? I'm going to come to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Get away from--",
        "Sandy: Back off!",
        "Jonathan: Damn it, Sandy, let her go!",
        "Sandy: I'm tired of the betrays. She's better off going over the edge than being with you.",
        "Tammy: ( Screams )",
        "Sandy: You're no good for her.",
        "Jonathan: All right, all right, all right, all right, stop. I'm not moving. Sandy, you don't want to do this. Listen, you love Tammy, okay? You would never hurt her; so just let her go. Come on.",
        "Sandy: I will if you do something.",
        "Jonathan: Anything. What?",
        "Sandy: You take her place. It'll be just like we were in Switzerland-- you and me for old time's sake. You do that, and I'll be happy to let her go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Next, on \"Guiding Light\"...",
        "Beth: Alan, do I need to remind you I'm carrying your child, which means I'm still in charge.",
        "Alan: Is that a threat, Beth?",
        "Coop: I've wanted to ask you out since the moment I first saw you. And I thought about kissing you every moment since I ever saw you.",
        "Sandy: You and me on a cliff, this is how it all started.",
        "Jonathan: And this is how I'm going to end it."
