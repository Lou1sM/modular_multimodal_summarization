        "Gus: The reason that we're here is a personal matter. I lost touch with somebody I knew a long time ago, and I understand that she used to teach here. I thought maybe you could tell us where she is now.",
        "Teacher: It's possible. What's her name?",
        "Gus: Rinaldi. Lucia Rinaldi?",
        "Teacher: I'm sorry, I can't help you.",
        "Gus: So you won't help us? You can't help us, you won't help us? Which one is it?",
        "Harley: She is a teacher. It should be against the law for her to lie. I'm going to drag her back in here.",
        "Gus: What are you going to do? You're going to jump her, haul her back in here?",
        "Harley: She knows where Lucia is.",
        "Gus: She isn't going anywhere.",
        "Harley: Lucia knows who you are. I don't want to...",
        "Gus: She's not going anywhere.",
        "Harley: Honey, she's already in the car on her way to...",
        "Gus: She isn't going anywhere.",
        "Harley: She can and she did.",
        "Gus: She hasn't left yet. Desperate times, desperate measures.",

        "Michelle: So who's the lucky guy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Oh, God! Alan, Alan... oh, Lord, what have I done? Oh, now, wait a minute. What have you done, Alan? You've taken extra pills haven't you? You fool! Alan, wake up.",
        "Alan: Olivia...",
        "Alexandra: No, don't you \"Olivia\" me.",
        "Alan: Olivia...",
        "Alexandra: No, no. Alan, come on, I want you to drink this. Here. Alan, please. Wake up. Will you wake up? All right, there you go. Okay, open your eyes, okay? Alan, I want you to snap out of it! For Pete's sakes. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Don't you ever do that to me again! Just drink.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: It doesn't matter. He can't stop us.",
        "Olivia: I don't want to see her.",
        "Phillip: It doesn't make a difference. If you want to go, we'll go.",
        "Olivia: Why don't you...",
        "Phillip: Oh, there you are. I'm checking Olivia out for the evening. I'll have her back before curfew.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, good.",
        "Olivia: \"Good\"? No objections?",
        "Alexandra: No, I actually think it's a very good idea for us to spend a little time apart.",
        "Phillip: Amen to that.",
        "Alexandra: No.",
        "Phillip: I need to get my keys.",
        "Alexandra: I'm sorry, but you can't go in there.",
        "Olivia: Did you, um... finally get lucky? You got a man in there?",
        "Alexandra: It's Alan. Please. No, I just thought you'd rather avoid him.",
        "Phillip: You don't need to referee for me. I can handle it, okay?",
        "Alexandra: Phillip, Phillip, I'm not fighting your battles for you. It's just that he's been ranting for an hour about the two of you. I finally got him calmed down. I just... I don't think it's a good idea if you to go in there and just stir him again.",
        "Phillip: You know what actually? I have to tell you, I agree with you. I don't care. I have an extra set of keys in the front. Let's not let them ruin the evening.",
        "Olivia: Let's not. Don't wait up.",
        "Phillip: Good night.",
        "Alexandra: Ha! Wouldn't dream of it. Alan, Alan, here. Come on, drink some more. Please.",

        "Edmund: Hello, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: Oh, hi, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: How are you?",
        "Tammy: Fine thanks.",
        "Edmund: It's all right, you know.",
        "Tammy: What?",
        "Edmund: You can talk to me.",
        "Tammy: I know that.",
        "Edmund: Good. So I can't believe you're going to be graduating from school in a couple of months.",
        "Tammy: Me neither.",
        "Edmund: How are the boys?",
        "Tammy: I'm not dating anyone.",
        "Edmund: I meant your brothers.",
        "Tammy: Oh. They're good. R.J.'s into everything, and Will looks up to him, which is funny because R.J.'s only five, but Will trails behind him like he's a shadow.",
        "Edmund: Yeah, I did the same thing with Richard.",
        "Tammy: Really? I thought you had a one-sided sibling rivalry with Richard since birth.",
        "Edmund: Well, mostly... mostly that's true, but I still looked up to him all the time. It's just at some point, things changed, and I stopped wanting to be like him and started wanting to take everything away from him. I wish I could go back...",
        "Tammy: You can't.",
        "Edmund: No, you're right. I can't. Hey, how do the boys feel about models, you know, trains, planes, automobiles, that kind of thing? Because the Smithsonian has some of the most amazing models that I have ever seen. And if you think they'd like them, I can bring back some for them when I'm down in Washington.",
        "Tammy: They love that stuff. Why are you going to Washington?",
        "Edmund: Your mother didn't tell you?",
        "Tammy: You don't exactly come up a lot around here.",
        "Edmund: No, no, I don't suppose I do. Well, I have been appointed Ambassador from San Cristobel to the United States.",
        "Tammy: That's... well, that was dad's position.",
        "Edmund: Yeah, Tammy, I know I can never fill his shoes, but I'm going to do my best to make him very proud, and I don't know why you should believe in me.",
        "Tammy: Well, I hope you can. Do you have meetings and stuff in D.C.?",
        "Edmund: Why, yes, we do. As a matter of fact, we're planning on building a library in your father's honor. It's going to have all of his papers and letters and...",
        "Tammy: Wow, you're really doing that?",
        "Edmund: Yes. Oh. Here.",
        "Tammy: Fundraiser for the library in Washington.",
        "Edmund: That invitation's for you and your mother.",
        "Tammy: Does mom know about this?",
        "Edmund: Well, yes, she does, but I think she thinks it best not to attend. But still, I want you to keep that anyway.",
        "Tammy: Mom won't go, but this is for dad? I don't understand.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: I'm sorry. I was... I was just looking for Danny.",
        "Cassie: He's not here. I am not expecting Danny, Michelle, okay?",
        "Michelle: Oh, no, no, I didn't think that. I just thought maybe that you would know where he is.",
        "Cassie: I don't. But I'm really happy to see that you're looking for him.",
        "Michelle: I'm glad to hear you say that. Because I know things have been weird between you and me since...",
        "Cassie: Since a long time ago. And we should just forget all about that, right? Good. Danny has been very busy with our projects, but I know that he really wants to make time for you and Robbie. I know that. So if I see him, I will send him your way, okay?",
        "Michelle: Thank you. Thanks. I'm sorry I interrupted you, whatever it is you're doing in there.",
        "Cassie: Uh... come in. I... I don't know. Spring cleaning maybe?",
        "Michelle: Wow! Robbie...",
        "Cassie: I don't know. I think I'm making a big mess.",
        "Michelle: Robbie would love to be here. He loves to make puddles. ( Laughter)",
        "Cassie: Yeah, so does Will and R.J. Well, this is the Princess Cassie pile. That is first lady pile. Farm girl Cassie. And that is \"What were you thinking Cassie?\" Otherwise known as the get-rid-of, throw- away pile.",
        "Michelle: Tell me you're not going to get rid of this. It's so beautiful.",
        "Cassie: Thank you. Richard gave this to me. You know, it's funny. I packed all his stuff up a long time ago, and I thought that was going to be the hardest thing ever. I didn't realize how much my things would remind me of him. So now I am just looking at all of this stuff, and I'm just wondering why I'm holding on to it.",
        "Michelle: Well, you know, when I thought that Danny was gone, I went up into our room and I went into our closet, and I wrapped all of his shirts that he left behind around me.",
        "Cassie: I know that one.",
        "Michelle: So yoga, huh?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. You don't think it's very me, do you? (Laughs)",
        "Michelle: No, no, no, I just... I just didn't know. No, I love yoga. I mean, running is more my thing. I never really got the hang of yoga. I kind of inhaled when you're supposed to exhale and I down-dogged when you're suppose to up-dog, and I just ended up all out of breath and uncoordinated and just didn't get it right.",
        "Cassie: Well, it's not about being right. It's about taking things back down to the basics. My life was so crazy before. I needed something to remind me to breathe, so...",
        "Michelle: Yeah, I think we all need that sometimes.",
        "Cassie: (Laughs) We do. It was a regular part of my life. It was. But that was my life with Richard, so...",
        "Michelle: You know, these things can still be a part of your life. I mean, it's okay to give up some of them, but it's also okay to keep some of them for you. I've got to find Danny. But... are you okay?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Great, fine.",
        "Michelle: You know, you have to remember that even though Richard's gone, he would still want you to be good to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Teacher: What is the plan here, young lady? Steal my keys, hold me captive until I give you what you want?",
        "Harley: Sounds about right to me.",
        "Teacher: I want my keys back. I don't have to talk to you.",
        "Harley: No, you don't, and you won't. Why is that? You're not in trouble. No one here is.",
        "Teacher: Then you have no reason to hold me.",
        "Harley: My partner is my reason. That guy deserves to know the truth about his past. Lucia may be the only person who can help him.",
        "Teacher: I have nothing to say to you.",
        "Harley: Why did you become a teacher?",
        "Teacher: The money.",
        "Harley: It was to help people, right? To help them to learn.",
        "Teacher: Not \"people,\" children.",
        "Harley: Okay, well, Gus is somebody's child. He deserves to know the truth. Every child deserves to know the truth about who they are and where they came from, don't they?",
        "Teacher: I have to honor my friend's wishes. I don't even know you.",
        "Harley: But she knows him. Or she used to anyway. Please. Come on. You have to give them this chance. Isn't there anything I can say to you to make you understand how important this is to him?",
        "Gus: Nothing that you can say, okay? There's nothing we can do. Here's your keys. Let's go; it's pointless. Let's go.",
        "Harley: What are you doing?",
        "Gus: This is not your fight. Let me try something. Hi. We're going to go. I'm sorry that we disturbed you. It's obvious to me that you have a secret, and I want you to keep it, all right?",
        "Teacher: You're going to keep trying to find her anyway, aren't you?",
        "Gus: Oh, I will find her.",
        "Teacher: And then what?",
        "Gus: I just have a question, and hopefully she has the answer.",
        "Teacher: What if she doesn't?",
        "Gus: Well, then she doesn't. I'm not out to punish her. I don't want anything to happen to her. It's just that recently something happened to turn my life upside down, and I wouldn't want that to happen to anybody else. I'm just trying to make sense of it, is all.",
        "Teacher: That's all I need to know.",
        "Gus: What made you change your mind?",
        "Teacher: You're going to find out one way or the other. She's been hurt a lot in her life. I hope you won't add to her pain.",
        "Gus: Mrs. Eison, that is the very last thing that I want to do, believe me.",
        "Teacher: Like your girlfriend said, I'm sure Lucia would like the chance to make things right.",
        "Harley: You are not serious.",

        "Cassie: Get a grip, Cassie. This isn't you anymore. This isn't it. Maybe there is no \"it.\"",

        "Olivia: I feel like I snuck out past curfew.",
        "Phillip: We can always go back.",
        "Olivia: No. Bite your tongue. I'm having a great time, you know. We're out of the house. There's no Alexandra, there's no Alan. Thanks.",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm.",
        "Olivia: Did I mention there's no Alan?",
        "Phillip: Yes, you did. When we were driving, I just felt like staying in the car and just going.",
        "Olivia: Interesting. That makes three of us. But that's not an option really. So a night out will have to be good enough. Now if I could just have a martini and three olives, everything would be right with the world.",
        "Phillip: Would you settle for the olives? You can have the olives. You'll have to wait for the rest till after the baby.",
        "Olivia: Our baby.",
        "Ross: Well, hello, you two.",
        "Phillip: Hello, Ross. Hey.",
        "Olivia: Hi.",
        "Phillip: Join us, please. Save me from drinking alone.",
        "Ross: (Laughs) I can't. I'm here to meet Blake.",
        "Phillip: Oh.",
        "Ross: Olivia, how's it going? How are you holding on?",
        "Olivia: I'm hanging in.",
        "Ross: Good. I remember when Blake was pregnant the last time, and about this stage, she could hardly keep anything down, and then she was moody. It was lovely for me.",
        "Olivia: Oh, that sounds awful for her and for you.",
        "Ross: Yeah.",
        "Olivia: I'm actually hungry a lot. And I just keeping thinking to myself that I'd be one of those happy people that usually annoy me if it weren't for this whole trial business.",
        "Phillip: So what is next, Ross?",
        "Ross: Well, my job is now to take the evidence such as it is and prove that it's circumstantial.",
        "Olivia: What are the chances of you doing that?",
        "Ross: Quite good, very good. In fact, the only thing that links you to this crime is your cell phone, and a number of other people had access to it. Beyond that, there's nothing else.",
        "Phillip: So that's great. So as long as... as long as nothing else comes up that you didn't have an opportunity to prepare for, then it should be fine, right?",
        "Ross: Well, in this case, like many others, it sort of unfolds like a chess game. And if I could see all the pieces, well, then I can win. If I don't see all the pieces and there's some surprises, well, we're all in trouble.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: All right, Alan, what do you want Nolan to tell cook to prepare for you? You have to eat something.",
        "Alan: Look, I am feeling just fine, Alexandra. I just... just let me sit down for a second.",
        "Alexandra: No, not fine. I come in here, you're sitting in a chair, you're passed out. I'm worried sick. I don't know, I think you're...",
        "Alan: You know what? You're not going to get rid of me that easily.",
        "Alexandra: All right, I was just worried about you, Alan. You had taken extra pills.",
        "Alan: Yeah, would you quit nagging me about those pills?",
        "Alexandra: Well, you should be glad somebody is worrying about you. All right, Nolan, I want you to tell cook to set the dining room for two. And you might inform Phillip and Olivia that we don't want to be disturbed. I think we've had enough excitement for one night.",
        "Nolan: Yes.",
        "Alexandra: They can eat in the other wing.",
        "Nolan: (Laughs) I agree. It's not a problem, though. They just left together a few minutes ago.",
        "Alexandra: Really? What? To go to dinner or...?",
        "Nolan: No, no, they said they'd be out for the evening.",
        "Alexandra: Oh. Well, fine. Then thank you, Nolan. I'll let you know what we decide on.",
        "Nolan: All right.",
        "Alexandra: You know, Alan, I think some of cook's cream of mushroom soup, it has those wonderful blend of herbs...",
        "Alan: Wait, wait, wait. You're telling me that Phillip and Olivia are out for dinner having a grand old time, and I get you and soup?",
        "Alexandra: You know, Alan, you can't keep worrying about what Phillip and Olivia are doing every single minute.",
        "Alan: You know, you are absolutely right, Alexandra.",
        "Alexandra: Well, of course, I am.",
        "Alan: Yes. I'm going out to dinner.",
        "Alexandra: No, you are not.",
        "Alan: I am going.",
        "Alexandra: All right, then I'm coming with you.",
        "Alan: You're not going to spoon-feed me.",
        "Alexandra: Fine. But you promise me we're going to go somewhere very quiet.",
        "Alan: I'm going to the club.",
        "Alexandra: All right. No more of these today. You've had quite enough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: So what's it going to look like, my dad's library? Do you have plans or whatever?",
        "Edmund: Well, we have architects working on it, but nothing set in stone right now, but as soon as something is, I'll be sure to show you what's happening. But right now I think I need to be shoving off. You keep that.",
        "Tammy: Mom, were you even going to tell me?",
        "Cassie: Tell you what?",
        "Tammy: The fundraiser for dad's library? Didn't I deserve to know?",
        "Cassie: Of course. Of course. Honey, I was going to tell you.",
        "Tammy: But you're not going to go?",
        "Cassie: Tammy, look, I was...",
        "Tammy: Well, why not?",
        "Edmund: Tammy, your mother has every right to feel about me the way she does.",
        "Cassie: Edmund, I don't need your help. This is between me and my daughter.",
        "Edmund: All right, well, the last thing I want to do is upset you.",
        "Cassie: Right. Well, you've done what you've come to do, so you can go now.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I'm trying to be a better brother for Richard now than I was to him when he was alive.",
        "Cassie: Well, too little too late.",
        "Edmund: But I know Richard would want you at that gala in Washington, D.C. I'm sorry I've made things such that you don't think you should go. But, regardless, I'm going to do everything within my power to make that library something he'd be proud of. Excuse me.",
        "Tammy: Mom, you're wrong.",
        "Cassie: Tammy, listen to me. You cannot let him manipulate you, okay? I know that he is one of our only connections to your father, but you know what? He's not worth it. He's not.",
        "Tammy: Okay, he's his brother. You can't change that. You just hate that he's alive and dad isn't.",
        "Cassie: Yes, I do. I do. But that's not the point here.",
        "Tammy: I know about all the bad stuff he did, and I don't care.",
        "Cassie: How can you say that?",
        "Tammy: He's not dad. He'll never be dad. But he is building this library for dad. That's what matters.",
        "Cassie: He is going to take that money and line his pockets with it. Tammy, he's going to profit from your father's memory. Do you realize that?",
        "Tammy: So? Dad knew who he was and was willing to still have him in his life.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Well, your dad's not here anymore.",
        "Tammy: You weren't the only one who loved him, you know. What about me and Will and R.J.? We loved him, too.",
        "Cassie: Honey, we honor him every day. We don't need Edmund for that.",
        "Tammy: I want to go.",
        "Cassie: You're making a mistake.",
        "Tammy: It's mine to make.",
        "Cassie: Tammy, he's going to break your heart.",
        "Tammy: No, it's not possible. I'd have to let him into my heart for him to be able to do that, and I could never do that, knowing all the pain he causes.",
        "Cassie: I know you think that, okay? I know that you think that. But you're opening a door, and I see it. He broke your father's heart over and over again, and I'm not going to stand by and watch it happen to you.",
        "Tammy: You won't have to watch it since you won't be there, will you?",
        "Cassie: I can't have this conversation with you right now, okay?",

        "Gus: Winnetka is a suburb. I'm a city guy. I don't know from suburbs. You know what? It's late. We can just do this tomorrow.",
        "Harley: Gus.",
        "Gus: What?",
        "Harley: I know you're scared. It's okay.",
        "Gus: I'm just about to get the answer I've been waiting for since I found out I'm adopted. I don't think I'm scared, okay?",
        "Harley: Okay. I just meant, uh... I know you're scared to tell me that you need to do it alone.",
        "Gus: Why would you say that? You've been with me every single step of the way-- Germany even. Are you kidding me? You think I don't want you to go across town with me? That's crazy.",
        "Harley: Well, this is it, right? And this moment belongs to you. This is the moment you've been waiting for. You certainly don't need an audience. Hey, this Lucia, she is the only link you have to your mother, you know. You're going to have to be really open to get her to tell you the truth, you know. You're going to have to call on whatever you might have meant to her, whatever your family meant to her to get her to give you the answer that you need. I don't want to get in the way of that.",
        "Gus: When this is over, why...",
        "Harley: When this is over, I'm going to remind you how great I am.",
        "Gus: You're not going to need to remind me.",

        "Olivia: No.",
        "Phillip: He said it, and you heard him. If he knew about the lipstick, he could prepare for it.",
        "Olivia: I also heard him say that my case is based purely on circumstantial evidence. We'll win or lose based on his belief in me.",
        "Phillip: He believes in you. He believes in you.",
        "Olivia: Is he going to believe in me after I show him the lipstick?",
        "Phillip: Listen. He's your attorney right now, and you're his client. He's going to defend you to the best of his ability no matter what. I know him. But I can tell you something else: If Alan is the one that's behind this, he is praying that you lied.",
        "Olivia: What? That's another bar on my prison cell.",
        "Phillip: Don't you understand? This is a bomb he wants to go off in court. The last thing he wants is for you to be honest with your attorney about it, because given time, it could prove his guilt. No, you hide this, you do it at your own risk.",

        "Alan: Will you stop deluding yourself, Phillip? It's really embarrassing. All you have to do is open your eyes and look at the fact. She is guilty. All you have to do is look at her track record, and everything falls into place.",
        "Phillip: You really think... you want to start bringing up track records around here?",
        "Alan: Oh, there's no contest. I will admit. I've made a few minor errors trying to hold on to someone who wasn't worthy of my attention. But Olivia, Olivia is an adulteress who set out to seduce her own stepson and in her spare time stalks a very popular TV personality, who happens to be the wife of her ex-husband. No, I think that the jury will see things my way and send you to jail and give me custody of my child.",

I would give anything to know that this baby is yours for sure, but in the absence of that, I'll be this baby's everything. I'll be his mother and his father before I ever let Alan get near him.
