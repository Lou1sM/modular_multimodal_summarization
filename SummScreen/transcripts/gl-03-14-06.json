        "Lizzie and Brian talk about payment for him pretending to take Ava out. Coop is impressed by how Ava looks for her date, but later finds the ad for \"Heavenly Hotties\" after Lizzie drops it. He goes to warn Ava about her date. Lizzie sees him at Towers and thinks that he is there for her but before he can tell her off, Beth and Alan walk in and Lizzie faints at the site of her \"dead\" Grandfather. Coop tells Ava the truth about Brian and she slaps him then tries to go after Lizzie. Coop gets her to hold off for a while. Frank calls Buzz and asks him to step in on his date with Olivia until he can get there since he has to finish up some police work. Buzz happily helps out, and he an Olivia share a kiss that ends right before Frank shows up. Cassie gets jealous when she sees Jeffrey with another woman where his band is playing but Jeffrey says that they should move on if she can't admit she wants to be with him. Sandy threatens to throw Jonathan off the cliff just as Reva shows up. She almost talks Sandy out of it until Jonathan opens his mouth and taunts Sandy that Tammy will never love him. As Tammy tries to save Jonathan, Sandy loses his footing and falls to his death at the bottom of the cliff. Tammy starts to freak out that she didn't mean for Sandy to fall as Frank shows up and says that he saw everything and he knows that Tammy was just trying to protect Jonathan."

        "Beth: Oh, look at you. You're beaming.",
        "Alan: Well, it's not everyday one returns from the dead. Although, I do think that my return is more fitting for a ticker tape parade as opposed to an emergency room.",
        "Beth: Well do you think that we could keep a low profile-- at least until we know for sure that nobody is going to find out about Gus.",
        "Alan: Don't worry about Gus. What I think we should do right now and go home and change because I want you to look your best when we let the world know that I'm back and that you are carrying my child.",

        "Ava: ( Laughing ) So what do you think?",
        "Coop: It's very um... okay, I'm a guy, I don't know what the right thing to say is.",
        "Ava: So if you were a guy who was taking me out, what would you say?",
        "Coop: Thank you.",
        "Ava: What?",
        "Coop: Look, can I say something to you as a guy who wants to see you not get hurt. Is this Brian guy worth you and this dress?",
        "Ava: That is really, really sweet. Thank you.",
        "Coop: It's just that you, the way you look, and this dress, it's a lot. And I just, um-- you know what, I'm going to stop and just say that it is nice to see you like this. That's all I'm going to say.",
        "Ava: Thank you.",
        "Coop: All right. Okay, come here. Come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Hey. What do you think you're doing?",
        "Brian: Exactly what you're paying me to do, and I want to tell you, even though Ava canceled that last date, I'm still charging you for the time.",
        "Lizzie: Do you think I care about the money?",
        "Brian: Well, you may not, but I do. I could have booked someone else.",
        "Lizzie: Fine, but I told you not to come back to Company. There is way too much potential for disaster... and jealousy.",
        "Brian: Chill, Lizzie. This is what I do for a living. Everything's taken care of.",

        "Reva: Why were you talking to my son about Sandy?",
        "Frank: Just like I told you, Sandy left a very scary message at the police station. He said he was scared. He said that Jonathan threatened him and then we found Sandy' cell phone.",
        "Reva: Where?",
        "Frank: At Fox Cliff. There's not anything there anymore. Reva! Where are you going?! Reva!",

        "Jonathan: Look, Sandy, you don't want to do this, okay. You love Tammy and you don't want to hurt her. So just let her go.",
        "Sandy: Okay, give me something first.",
        "Jonathan: What? Anything. What?",
        "Sandy: Come over here and take her place.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan, don't.",
        "Sandy: We'll pretend we're in Switzerland again-- just you and me like it was before. Then I'll be happy to let her go.",
        "Tammy: Don't.",
        "Jonathan: Okay, okay, okay. Let her go now.",
        "Sandy: Okay, here we are. You and me on a cliff. This is how it all started.",

        "Waiter: You're welcome.",
        "Ava: It's been a while since I've been on a date.",
        "Brian: Well, I can't imagine that you have too much trouble getting guys to notice you.",
        "Ava: Yeah, the right guys, I guess.",
        "Brian: That's amazing to me. You know, I don't ask girls out very often, but when I saw you...",
        "Ava: You're embarrassing me.",
        "Brian: There's just something about you.",
        "Ava: Yeah, you think?",
        "Coop: Yeah, of course. I've wanted to ask you out since the moment I first saw you. And I've thought about kissing you every second since then. Every time I see you and every time I close my eyes...",
        "Brian: Ava. Ava. Are you still with me?",
        "Ava: Oh. Yeah, sure.",
        "Brian: Good, because it's your night. And if you could have anything, what would it be?",

        "Coop: Yeah, good for her.",
        "Lizzie: I hate this. I hate how it is between us.",
        "Coop: Me, too, but I didn't get us here.",
        "Lizzie: I know, and I will never forgive myself for ruining the best thing I ever had.",
        "Coop: You know, I thought about you the other day.",
        "Lizzie: You did?",
        "Coop: Yeah. I was actually taking a walk down by the park and I saw this little dog in one of the ratty, old, hooded sweatshirts.",
        "Lizzie: Okay...",
        "Coop: No, it... it just made me think. I imagined what if he ran into Roxy with all of her jewelry and her pink sweater and, you know, the princess...",
        "Lizzie: And he's the solid, decent...",
        "Coop: Mutt?",
        "Lizzie: Actually, I was going to say hero. I, um... have to go meet my mom, but I just wanted to stop and say hi.",
        "Coop: Hi.",
        "Lizzie: And that I miss you.",
        "Coop: Yeah.",
        "Lizzie: Maybe sometime soon you and I could go on a date of our own.",

        "Alan: Isn't this something, Alan Spaulding in an elevator with a beautiful woman who happens to be his wife carrying his child?",
        "Beth: Alan, let's get something clear.",
        "Alan: All right.",
        "Beth: When we talk in there, we're going to give people the shock of their lives.",
        "Alan: ( Laughs ) Yes, we are.",
        "Beth: The point is: We don't want to send Lizzie into an emotional tailspin. She just got over mourning her father, and now she's been mourning you.",
        "Alan: Yes, but I'm back.",
        "Beth: Oh, can you see, this is so typical of you. You think you can leave this path of destruction, but it doesn't matter as long as you win. Well, there are consequences, and one of them happens to be your granddaughter.",
        "Alan: Let me make one thing very straight, Beth. Elizabeth is only concerned that I'm well and I'm alive. None of this was my fault. Maybe I should tell her to ask her mother about that.",
        "Beth: No.",
        "Alan: I thought not.",
        "Beth: Alan, do I need to remind you I'm carrying your child, which means I'm still in charge?",
        "Alan: Is that a threat, Beth? Because let me remind you: You kept Gus and I prisoners for quite a long time. What would people think if they found that out?",
        "Beth: If they found that out, your child would be born in prison. How do you like that?",
        "Alan: ( Laughs ) I'm so glad we didn't get a divorce.",

        "Cassie: What are you going to play?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I don't know now. Probably something sad and lonely.",

        "Cassie: Fine.",
        "Jeffrey: And work?",

        "Jeffrey: No, not really.",
        "Cassie: Me, either.",
        "Jeffrey: But, you know, I really do... I have to know, I need to know, how are you?",
        "Cassie: Well, I don't know where my daughter is, and that bothers me a lot. I don't know where I am myself most of the time, and that bothers me a lot.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, let's work from the outside in. So, Tammy, what's bothering you the most there?",
        "Cassie: That she's with Jonathan and at any minute they could be getting married, and...",
        "Jeffrey: And?",
        "Cassie: There's you.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, then, at least I'm still in there somewhere.",
        "Cassie: Of course you are. You know you are. I am deeply, deeply sad, Jeffrey, and all I want to do is call you and ask you to come home to the farm and ask you to come home to me.",
        "Jeffrey: But you don't.",
        "Cassie: And I know-- I know a lot of women would say I'm crazy and you're a good man and so I just have to get over it, but you did something to me, Jeffrey, and it's not something you can just go back and take back.",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie, you know, I...",
        "Cassie: So when I wake up in the morning and I look at my life and I think about that, I still want my daughter to come home, but not you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Sandy... I know you're mad, Sandy.",
        "Sandy: Mad? You think mad covers it? Do you think we would be up here if I was just sort of mad?",
        "Tammy: I don't care why we're up here; nothing that's happened justifies this.",
        "Sandy: Well I think so.",
        "Jonathan: You set me up.",
        "Sandy: Oh, yeah, I did. It worked, too, didn't it? You know why? Because everyone knows who you really are. Even the love of your life thinks you're a murderer.",
        "Jonathan: Maybe she's right.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan, stop it. Let's... we should just go. Just leave him alone; let's go.",
        "Jonathan: You hear that? Maybe we should just go. ( Grunts ) Are you so deluded that you think I would let you push me off of a cliff again?! It's over! You lose!",

        "Coop: You would be very surprised.",
        "Buzz: What happened?",
        "Coop: Every time I soften up, every time I seem to let her back in my life again...",
        "Buzz: You're going to let me guess what it is?",
        "Coop: Dad, it's Lizzie, all right. I'm talking about Lizzie.",
        "Buzz: Oh, you're kidding me.",
        "Coop: Are you just going to stand there? Are you going to listen to me, or are you just going to make fun of me?",
        "Buzz: Actually, I can do both.",
        "Coop: Dad, I love her, okay?",
        "Buzz: Okay.",
        "Coop: Sometimes I can't-- I don't like her sometimes, Dad. I don't like her.",
        "Buzz: Ouch.",
        "Coop: I know she can't help it, all right. She lies sometimes, and I wish I could explain why and I wish I knew how she lied so easily, but I don't. There are a million different theories because honestly, there are a million different reasons why lies. And, Frankly, there are you know, her family-- her family and you know, let's be honest here, it's her family. I'm not talking about little lies. I mean, she always seems to be telling lies. I mean she's either telling them, or she's involved in them, or she's creating them. And I don't know how I can live with it.",
        "Buzz: Is it my turn to talk already?",
        "Coop: Dad.",
        "Buzz: Um... Coop, you lay down with dogs, you wake up with fleas.",
        "Coop: That's it?",
        "Buzz: You knew who she was. I'm not defending her, but you knew who she was when you got into it. You knew who she was and you didn't like her for it.",
        "Coop: Yes, I know, but I thought that maybe she could--",
        "Buzz: Change? You changed her? How much? You can't expect her not to be what she is. I mean you can't... you have to live life with your eyes open to what she is. Because if you walk around with your eyes closed, pretending your blind, you know that's like rolling molasses up a sand hill.",
        "Coop: Molasses up a sand hill? Dad, where do you get this crap?",
        "Buzz: I'm greek. You know, epic tragedy, we invented it and drama...",
        "Coop: Yeah...",
        "Buzz: Anyway, if you'll excuse me, I have a friend who's a chef at Towers and she's going to show a batch--",
        "Coop: Whoa, whoa. Whatever. Look, I'm going to come with you to Towers, okay?",
        "Buzz: Huh? What happened?",

        "Brian: Really?",
        "Ava: Really, I'm a total geek.",
        "Brian: Are you one of the super hot babes who says she was all skinny and gangly when she was young?",
        "Ava: You didn't just call me a super hot babe, did you?",
        "Brian: ( Laughs ) Well, that was pretty bad, huh?",
        "Ava: Yeah, it was pretty bad, but I've been called worse.",
        "Brian: How about an amazingly beautiful woman?",
        "Ava: I'll take that.",
        "Brian: You think we could get out of here? Maybe get a night-cap or coffee? I have a brand new espresso machine.",
        "Ava: Oh, back at your place. I don't think so.",
        "Brian: It's the guy from work, right? I saw the way you looked at him.",
        "Ava: The way I looked at him?",
        "Brian: I also saw he had a girlfriend. I mean, you could waste your time with someone who's unavailable. I promise, I wouldn't be a mistake.",

        "Frank: Hey, Pop, listen. I need you to do something for me, okay?",
        "Buzz: Does this have anything to do with me and running anywhere?",
        "Frank: No, but I've got a really important date at Towers with Olivia, and I'm running late. So, listen. I need you to go in there and fill in for me until I get there, all right? And, listen, Pop. I wouldn't ask you to do this in a million years, but we've been trying to do this date for a long time, and she was finally able to get a baby-sitter, okay?",
        "Buzz: I'll do what I can. Another one of life's little tests.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: What are you doing here?",
        "Coop: Lizzie, it is funny you that should ask that. There's something we need to get straight right now.",

        "Cassie: You know, I wish I could say everything was forgiven and forgotten with us, but it's not.",
        "Jeffrey: You made that very clear.",
        "Cassie: I just got over all of Edmund's lies, but just barely. And I am not going to go through that with you, no matter how much I love you. And I'm tired of looking the other way and shutting everything down. I'm angry, Jeffrey. I am really, really angry.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you're entitled.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I think I am.",
        "Jeffrey: Look, I'm going to carry what I did to you with me for the rest of my life. I hope you understand that. I'm not going to beg you to take me back. I've tried to apologize to you; I have apologized to you in more ways than I thought possible, but you've also made it very clear that being sorry is not enough. Being sorry is not going to change the way you feel. So I have to respect that that's the way it's going to be and move on.",

        "Reva: Listen. And I forgave you. Do you know why?",
        "Sandy: Because you've been through a lot and it makes you a sympathetic person.",
        "Reva: No, sweetie, sympathy has nothing to do with it. There was a reason I loved you, and I do.",
