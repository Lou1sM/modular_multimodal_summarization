She's been 'outed' as Carrie's killer and he's been accused of shielding her from prosecution. Jeffrey realizes he must excuse himself from Marah's case and warns his replacement, Doris Wolfe, not to let any problems the two of them had in the past get in the way of doing what is right. At the fairgrounds, Reva encounters Harley and they realize they're both anxious to find a way to help Marah. They decide that two heads are better than one. But it's at the fairgrounds where Reva learns the bombshell about Marah \u0096 and it's Doris who delivers the news. Jeffrey is sorting through the evidence he's required to pass along to Doris, but gets wind she's considering convening a Grand Jury. As he gets the news, he holds a file containing all his notes and he looks up to see he's a few steps from a shredding machine. Cassie and Edmund are at Company with the startling photo of Jeffrey and Christopher. Cassie's more startled by the insecurity Edmund harbors, leading him to investigate Jeffrey to begin with."

    "Transcript": [
        "Cassie: So you're saying that jeffrey o'neill and christopher langham were in the cia?",
        "Edmund: The photograph is genuine and the information is accurate.",
        "Cassie: And who's she?",
        "Edmund: I don't know. Not yet. I know, cassie, it's very shocking. Not so much that o'neill was in the cia, but langham was. They had to come to town with some sort of agenda.",
        "Cassie: Are you implying that they're still in the cia?",
        "Edmund: Well, I don't know what their true affiliations are. I don't thing anybody does. I say that bares further investigation. I know, cassie, it's very disturbing.",
        "Cassie: What's disturbing is the only person who is covertly gathering information and talking about further investigation is you. And I'd like to know why.",
        "Reva: Who's there? Come out now. I'm not kidding.",
        "Harley: It's just me.",
        "Reva: Harley-- is that you? Oh, you scared me half to death. What are you doing?",
        "Harley: You know, a cop would say, \"don't move. Keep you hands were I can see them, reva.\"",
        "Reva: Have you been following me?",
        "Harley: No. I didn't know you'd be here. I didn't think anybody be here. Look at this creepy place.",
        "Reva: Well, then why did you come?",
        "Harley: Well, I guess I could ask the same of you.",
        "Reva: (]Laughs)",
        "Harley: But I don't think i have to. Maryanne caruther's, right?",
        "Reva: You know?",
        "Harley: Well, I got a little bit of information from marina and gus. What about you? Josh?",
        "Reva: Yeah. It only took him 30 years. Can you imagine keeping the death of someone a secret for that long?",
        "Harley: I've got to tell you, reva, I'm just worried it's not over.",
        "Reva: What do you mean?",
        "Harley: You know, when I look at how maryanne's aunt carrie operated, I just get this instinct, this feeling that she's got a whole bunch of nasty surprises still planned for us.",
        "Reva: The woman's dead.",
        "Harley: She could have planned that, too. It fits the profile. Somebody who is pathologically obsessed with revenge. So I came down here to poke around, see if I could find something to tip me off about a potential trap she set. What's your excuse?",
        "Reva: I'm looking for a ghost.",
        "Reporter: To recap our top story, \"the springfield journal\" reports that marah lewis has emerged as the new suspect in the shooting death of caroline caruthers. However charges against her have yet to be filed raising the question of special treatment as sources indicate miss lewis and district attorney jeffrey o'neill have been involved in a sexual relationship.",
        "Josh: I had the tv on in the other room.",
        "Marah: I don't believe this.",
        "Josh: Come here. Come here.",
        "Marah: Dad, who would do this?",
        "Josh: It's going to be okay, sweetheart. Your mom and I are going to do everything we can to help you get through this. I promise.",
        "Marah: I don't care about me. I'm just worried about what this is going to do to jeffrey.",
        "Josh: Well, that depends.",
        "Marah: On what?",
        "Josh: On whether or not it's true.",
        "Assistant: What are you going to do about this?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, it's already been done.",
        "Mayor: Ah. You've seen it.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. I take it you've seen it, too. Thanks.",
        "Mayor: Doris wolfe tracked me down in the parking lot and showed me a copy.",
        "Jeffrey: Doris wolfe. Well, it's nice to know that our assistant da is so hard at work.",
        "Mayor: Jeffrey, I will back you all the way on this. My office will not stand for the libeling of a public official.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, I appreciate that, but that's not exactly what happened. Well, you see, marah lewis and I... well, we have a friendship.",
        "Mayor: I see.",
        "Jeffrey: There you go. Hot off the press. It's my letter of recusal. I'm taking myself off of the case.",
        "Mayor: Are you sure about this?",
        "Jeffrey: Yes I'm sure. I'm off the case.",
        "Mayor: And who will you appoint to replace you?",
        "Doris: On what? Are recusing yourself on the caruther's case?",
        "Jeffrey: You've read the headlines, doris.",
        "Doris: I'm sorry. It's not a very pleasant situation.",
        "Jeffrey: No, it's not.",
        "Doris: Well, I would be glad to step in. I mean I know I am only the assistant da, but I do know my way around the courtroom.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you're going to have to get yourself up to speed on the case.",
        "Doris: Well, I've already taken the liberty to look over the statements.",
        "Jeffrey: Really?",
        "Doris: Hmm.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh. So you'll see that we'll need to pled it out.",
        "Doris: Why would I see that?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, because there's a confession. There's no premeditation. The shooting was obviously done in self defense. So why press charges?",
        "Doris: Well, is this why you wouldn't publicly name marah lewis as the new suspect?",
        "Jeffrey: I kept her name out of the papers to respect her privacy.",
        "Doris: That's the policy when dealing with minors. But marah lewis isn't a minor is she? I mean... or you wouldn't be involved with her. Unless the papers are wrong.",
        "Mayor: Play nice now. This is a public venue.",
        "Jeffrey: No, that's quite all right, mr. Mayor. Don't let the tension between ms. Wolfe and I concern you. I mean it's to be expected. After all, I just came right into town and pushed her out of a job that she was beginning to think belonged to her. So it's only natural that's there some lingering resentment. However, I do believe that she is consummate professional.",
        "Doris: And a damn good prosecutor.",
        "Jeffrey: Which is why it is my intention to assign you this case. Because I am sure that you're going to handle it with all of that vaunted professionalism that you've known for.",
        "Doris: As opposed to what? Letting personal issues get in the way?",
        "Jeffrey: For example.",
        "Doris: Well, I can certainly see why you would have personal issues on your mind right now.",
        "Marah: Do you really want the answer to that question?",
        "Josh: Only if you want to tell me.",
        "Marah: Jeffrey and I... were lovers.",
        "Josh: When?",
        "Marah: New year's eve. Dad?",
        "Josh: Oh, man. (Laughs)",
        "Marah: Dad, please don't be mad.",
        "Josh: I'm not. I...",
        "Marah: I'm not a little girl.",
        "Josh: I know that, sweetheart. I...",
        "Marah: It was totally my idea. Jeffrey thought that it absolutely should not even happen.",
        "Josh: Really?",
        "Marah: He thought that we were too... that i was too young to get involved with him.",
        "Josh: Obviously he changed his mind, huh?",
        "Marah: I persuaded him. And it took some doing. We sort of made a deal. That it would be a one time gift that we would give to each other. And you know what? I want to tell you something else.",
        "Josh: Well, actually, um...",
        "Marah: Dad.",
        "Josh: Hmm.",
        "Marah: I want you to know that it was one of the most beautiful nights of my life. It was perfect. Jeffrey and I created our own little world where I felt safe and whole and cherished. And it was wonderful.",
        "Josh: Do you love him?",
        "Marah: I, um... I wanted him. And I still do. And that's just the way it is. Neither of us planned for this.",
        "Josh: Okay. You're right. You're not a little girl anymore. You're a grown woman. (Groans)",
        "Marah: And jeffrey is not trying to do anything illegal right now.",
        "Josh: I... I...",
        "Marah: He's just trying to protect me.",
        "Josh: I know that. And I appreciate that. In fact, I... I respect the way he's been dealing with this thing so far. I really do.",
        "Marah: It's still going to blow up in his face.",
        "Josh: Marah, jeffrey's the district attorney and he can handle himself. Especially when it concerns the law. So you have to let him do that. You have to focus on yourself right now.",
        "Marah: You just want me to pretend like he doesn't exist?",
        "Josh: You have to stay away from him right now, okay. Look, I know you're worried about him. I know you don't want to do anything that going to cause him anymore trouble. But if you're seen together that's exactly what's going to happen. You can't give the press or anyone else for that matter anymore anumition to use against either one of you.",
        "Marah: You know what? I just want to know who went to the press. Because there are not that many people that know about jeffrey and me. I want to know who would do this to me.",
        "Sandy: We just saw the paper.",
        "Shayne: It's pretty amazing that these idiots can call lies like this news.",
        "Marah: Shayne, they're not lies. Least not the part about jeffrey and me.",
        "Shayne: You and o'neill?",
        "Marah: Well, it's not what they're making to be, but yes. Basically it's true.",
        "Sandy: And the other part that you're not being charged with the shooting because you and jeffrey are an item. Marah> No.",
        "Sandy: Is that true?",
        "Marah: No. That is not true at all. Jeffrey was just trying to keep my name out of the papers as long as possible. That's it.",
        "Shayne: And now they're using that to make you look guilty.",
        "Marah: Shayne, I am guilty. I shot carrie.",
        "Josh: In self defense, marah. That's an important part of the situation. You're intent, you were protecting me. You were protecting all of us that were there that night.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, but all of that is going to get fuzzy now.",
        "Josh: Shayne...",
        "Shayne: I mean now that there's a scandal to pay attention to.",
        "Sandy: Which is exactly the way somebody wants it.",
        "Josh: We don't know that for sure.",
        "Sandy: Come on. This source didn't talk to \"the journal\" by accident.",
        "Shayne: We need to find out who this guy is.",
        "Josh: No. You need to settle down, okay.",
        "Shayne: No, if we could put a name to the person then we could do something about it.",
        "Josh: Shayne, let it go, okay.",
        "Sandy: You know...",
        "Josh: Let it...",
        "Sandy: I don't think so. I think he's right. We really should nail this guy.",
        "Josh: Let it go, both of you. Right now! I don't want anyone in this family doing anything that's going to hurt marah's case, do you understand me?",
        "Harley: So you're saying that the spirit of maryanne caruthers has been reaching out to you?",
        "Reva: Yeah, trying to tell me something. I think.",
        "Harley: About the drowning?",
        "Reva: Or the whole situation. I'm just... I'm not sure. But there is a reason to go through all of this. And what I'm doing is that much different than what you do, you know, gathering information. I'm just doing it in the more alternative form.",
        "Harley: One that's pretty tough to use in court. I mean really, how do you swear on a poltergeist?",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, good point.",
        "Harley: You know, reva, i know that you're as worried about marah and josh as I am about my dad and marina. And we've got these different ways of unraveling a mystery.",
        "Reva: I don't like mysteries. All I have is what I've got which is a bad feeling about this whole mess. At least you have real world tools to get answers.",
        "Harley: Tools? What good have they done me? I don't have any answers.",
        "Reva: Well, I don't either.",
        "Harley: Well, that's what I'm trying to say. It's like, you know, synchronicity. Now we ca either stand here and stare at each like this has been a wasted trip, or you can be another set of eyes for me. Figure out what they might have missed.",
        "Reva: Are you talking about what I think you're talking about? You want us to work together?",
        "Harley: Boy, you've got this psychic thing down.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I did this...",
        "Cassie: Did this picture happen to fall in your lap? Did you open up your mailbox and it was there?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, please. It's not--",
        "Cassie: The answer's no to that.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, reva, possibly the person you're closest to in the world is working with and getting close to a man who may not have her best interest at heart.",
        "Cassie: That's your take on it, edmund.",
        "Edmund: All right. Do you know what christopher langham's goals are? Do you know what his motives are? Can you tell me absolutely for certain?",
        "Cassie: No, I can'T.",
        "Edmund: All right, fine. Neither can I. I don't think reva can either. Don't you find that just a little bit worrisome?",
        "Cassie: Okay, so you had some questions about christopher langham. That's why you got a hold of this picture? That's why?",
        "Edmund: Cassie...",
        "Cassie: The answer is no to that. It was jeffrey o'neill that you were gathering information on, right?",
        "Edmund: Cassie...",
        "Cassie: You were having jeffrey o'neill investigated, weren't you?",
        "Edmund: Yes, I was. Of course. I was. Wait.",
        "Reva: I already told you i don't like mysteries. What about blake? Blake's perfect for this, right?",
        "Harley: Well, normally blake is perfect for this stuff. I mean she is my partner. But I just feel like you and i would make such a good team on this. Come on, reva. Hey, I don't expect you to analyze the hard evidence. But if anybody could get into carrie caruther's head, it's you.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, I'm already in touch with her niece. So what's one more family member?",
        "Harley: Think of it as a two prong attack. (Laughter) it's not going to be a snap getting to the bottom of this. I'll tell you, if carrie caruthers was anything it was unorganized. Look at this. Look at this. She set up all these lights. She set up a sound system out here. She anticipated everything. You know, she took premeditated to a whole new level. That's why even though she's gone, I tell you I just feel like her threat is not.",
        "Reva: Well, then maybe it is important for me to get some sort of sense of carrie's process of thinking. As it is for you to find an actual clue.",
        "Harley: Exactly. So come on, let's look around. Let's see if there's anything they missed.",
        "Reva: Okay. Vanishing vanquo, world's greatest illusionist.",
        "Harley: What? Are you getting something about the sign?",
        "Reva: No.",
        "Josh: You're not going to bust anybody heads, you're not going to teach anybody any lessons. Is that understood?",
        "Shayne: Dad, but if we could figure out--",
        "Josh: I understand, son. I understand that you want to protect your sister, I get that. But this is not the way to do it. You could make things worse as a matter of fact for marah. Because you could bring her more publicity than she really wants. So forget the heroics, and keep a low profile. Okay?",
        "Shayne: All right. Yeah.",
        "Josh: Okay. Fine. Thank you. Both of you. Now, we have to finish a conversation we were in the middle of. So if you wouldn't mind.",
        "Shayne: Yes.",
        "Josh: Thank you.",
        "Shayne: So where are we going first?",
        "Sandy: The beacon.",
        "Shayne: Let's so it.",
        "Josh: Marah, marah, don't do that, okay. If you need to talk to somebody, talk to me.",
        "Marah: Dad, I just want to know that he's okay.",
        "Josh: My guess is that right now, he's doing whatever damage control he can do. And with the situation the way it is, that's not going to be easy for him.",
        "Marah: You think that I never should have spent the night with him.",
        "Josh: I'm your father. I kind of think that you should never spend the night with anybody ever again. Yeah. (Phone rings) hello? What? Hey, you know what? I don't really care what television station you're from. You're not going to ask my daughter any questions at all. So don't bother calling back here again. You understand me? Unbelievable.",
        "Marah: This was exactly what it was like for mom after richard died. Phone calls, the media. What's next? Are we going to get a rock through our window again?",
        "Josh: You know what? You know what the thing is though about situation, marah. They change. And often they change for the better. Now right now, there's what the public thinks they know and there's the whole story. There's the truth. Did you pull that trigger? Yes, you did. Did you sleep with jeffrey o'neill? Yes. But we know that there is a whole lot more to both of those stories. Right?",
        "Jeffrey: I'd like to add a point of clarification if I may from both of you. I'm recusing myself from this case because marah lewis and i had a friendship, not because we have been abusing the powers of my office in anyway to keep her from facing justice, okay?",
        "Doris: Well, unfortunately there is that perception.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, the media deals in perception, doris. We like to deal in facts, remember? And the facts are that marah came to me of her own free will to make that statement. And the facts are also that there are witnesses to corroborate that statement.",
        "Doris: The witnesses who changed their stories? Are those the ones you mean?",
        "Jeffrey: Doris, I am sure that once you delve into this case and study the evidence, you'll understand why they did what they did.",
        "Mayor: Then I suppose we can all go about our business.",
        "Doris: You know what? While we're on the subject of evidence, I did read one of those reports that said marah lewis tested positively for a drug called antomonious immediately after the shooting.",
        "Jeffrey: That's right. There's good reason to believe that she was given the drug against her will. So that would have affected her behavior that night, yes.",
        "Doris: Unless she knew exactly what she was taking.",
        "Jeffrey: If you are suggesting that marah is some sort of a drug user--",
        "Doris: I am simply examining all the possibilities.",
        "Jeffrey: Well you can examine all the possibilities you like, you're not going to find anything that shows you that marah lewis is a drug user or a drug addict, okay. Let me give you a piece of advice while I'm at it from someone who's not accustomed to losing. There's going to be a life after the state versus marah lewis. And I'm still going to be here assessing your performance.",
        "Doris: Is that a threat?",
        "Jeffrey: No, that's just a reminder.",
        "Mayor: We are all hoping this case will be resolved with as little public furor as possible. Jeffrey, I'm accepting your letter of recusal. And, doris, I know you will do a fine job handling this case. Now, if you will excuse me, i have a counsel meeting to get to.",
        "Jeffrey: Thank you, mr. Mayor.",
        "Doris: Look, I know you have a lot of clout. But you should know that I do not scare easily and I will follow this case wherever it leaves me. Now when do I get to see the paper work?",
        "Jeffrey: I'll personally put it all together for you. How's that?",
        "Doris: All the work product. Any notes you made. You did say that marah lewis came to you personally. I'm sure you made notes.",
        "Jeffrey: I keep a lot of things up here, you know. But I'll try to gather everything that I have.",
        "Doris: All the material, jeffrey. I'd hate to have to subpoena what's in your head.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, please listen to me. I only showed you that photograph because I thought reva might be directly and adversely impacted by the formation that went along with it.",
        "Cassie: When did you decide to look into jeffrey's past? No, better question: Why did you do it, edmund?",
        "Edmund: I can answer both. I started doing it a long time ago. Months ago. And I did because I was quite sure that there was more to jeffrey o'neill than he was letting on and I was right.",
        "Cassie: There's more to everyone than they've lead on.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, he was with the cia.",
        "Cassie: So what? Big deal. I mean, really. So what if he was some secret agent, you know? Well, obviously it's a big deal to you because you think he had some sinister conspiracy thing going on. A whole bunch of deep dark secrets in his head. Is that it?",
        "Edmund: What is about? That I've gone back to my old mistrustful self, is that it?",
        "Cassie: Well, it's bring up a lot of bad memories, I've got to tell you.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, the truth is, I put dax on this assignment so long ago that I forgotten I've done it.",
        "Cassie: Dax? You brought dax into this?",
        "Edmund: If that's not a testament tat I had forgotten about the inquiry, I don't know what does.",
        "Cassie: Then why start it from the beginning? Why?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, you really have to ask that? The twin. The identical twin, the rubber stamp of my dead brother shows up in town. And if that's not enough, from the moment you meet him, there's sparks flying between the two of you.",
        "Cassie: Jeffrey and I hated each other. Oh, wait a second. Are you trying to tell me that you're looking into his past because you thought he might come between us?",
        "Edmund: I don't know. God, cassie, I'm not exactly proud of this, but I was worried that you were making yourself hate him because the alternative would be to...",
        "Cassie: What happened to us telling each other everything no matter how hard it might be to say?",
        "Edmund: I am telling you, cassie. And it's very hard.",
        "Cassie: I just don't know how you could be so threatened. I mean, did I doodle his name on a cocktail napkin? Did I call his name while we were making love?",
        "Edmund: Oh, please, cassie.",
        "Cassie: Well, that no more ridiculous than what's going o in your head. I fall in love with the one man that everyone told me to stay away from. So I would like to know what i could have possibly done to make you feel so insecure that you had to put jeffrey o'neill under the microscope?",
        "Edmund: I didn't say it was fair, cassie. I only said that I did it. And I would do it again.",
        "Shayne: I hate seeing this garbage everywhere. So why are we standing here again?",
        "Sandy: O'neill lives here.",
        "Shayne: Ah-huh.",
        "Sandy: And I've got a hunch that someone saw marah leaving his room new year's morning like I did.",
        "Shayne: What?",
        "Sandy: Yeah, I was here. And someone else must have gotten an eyeful. There are guests, employees.",
        "Shayne: Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second. How long have you known this? I mean, I was with you when i saw the stupid headline and you didn't say anything. Nothing.",
        "Sandy: I know.",
        "Shayne: So what, you were just letting me go crazy thinking about all these lies that the reporters are saying and you knew all along that they were true?",
        "Sandy: It wasn't my truth to tell. It was marah'S.",
        "Shayne: How long have you known about this? Since what, new year's? You didn't say anything?",
        "Sandy: Yeah, and I'd still be sitting on it if marah hadn't told you what was what just now at the house.",
        "Shayne: You really wouldn't have said anything?",
        "Sandy: It's her business, not mines. And I have to respect that.",
        "Shayne: Well, I think you passed the test.",
        "Sandy: What test?",
        "Shayne: It's a family thing. You did good, bro. Let's go in here and see if your theory works out.",
        "Marah: Another reporter?",
        "Josh: Actually, that was jeffrey.",
        "Marah: Why didn't you come get me?",
        "Josh: He... he just wanted to know if you're okay.",
        "Marah: Well, I'm not.",
        "Josh: Marah, I thought we talked about this already, you know. It's best if you two don't have any contact with each other right now.",
        "Marah: Best for who? For you? I'm sorry, okay. I just... is he okay? I mean he's not going to get fired for this, right?",
        "Josh: He didn't say.",
        "Marah: I just... I just want to hear his voice.",
        "Josh: Marah, jeffrey agrees with me. The risk is too great for you two to be talking to each other right now.",
        "Marah: Yes, the risk. The risk. We can't forget about the risks.",
        "Josh: I really wish this could be easier for you.",
        "Marah: Yeah, well... you know, I promised jeffrey that I wouldn't hurt him. Now look at what I've done.",
        "Josh: Sweetheart, he knew, I'm sorry to put it this way. But he knew the risk that he was getting into before he got involved with you.",
        "Marah: Yeah, but he didn't know that I was going to end up shooting someone a couple months later.",
        "Josh: You know what the good thing is about a juicy scandal? It goes away. Something new comes along and even the best gossip turns stale. And people get all excited about whatever the new shocker is, you know, the new outrage.",
        "Marah: Yeah, and for now, I'm it. Jeffrey and I are.",
        "Josh: He sounded like he was okay.",
        "Marah: He did?",
        "Josh: Yes.",
        "Marah: Look at me. I'm so worried about how jeffrey is and what I did to him that I've totally neglected you. I probably hurt you even more. Dad, I'm sorry that I let carrie into our lives.",
        "Josh: No. Don't do that. Don't apologize for that. I was the one that let carrie into our lives when I made that secret pact. Choices we make can change our lives forever. They can ruin our lives. Look, marah, do remember, you know, when you were little? When you were a little girl you used to come to me and ask my advice on this and that and the other thing.",
        "Marah: Yes. You would tell me, well, what do you think you should do?",
        "Josh: That's right. Then more often than not, you made good choices.",
        "Marah: Yeah, but I've got grown-up choices to make now.",
        "Josh: But you're making... you're making them in a grown-up way. I didn't want you to remember what happened that night in the fun house. But when you did remember, i didn't want you to come forward. But as horrific as it was for me to sit there and listen to you tell jeffrey o'neill that you were the one that pulled the trigger, that's how proud I was of you in that moment. You stood up and you did the right thing. You took responsibility. And that's something that I... that I didn't have the guts to do when I was your age.",
        "Marah: Who do you think I got the guts from? You, dad. (Crying)",
        "Josh: No.",
        "Marah: Yes.",
        "Josh: No.",
        "Marah: Yes. All those times when I was little and I would ask the questions of what's right and what's wrong, you were the one who taught me the difference. Yeah, you know, I stood up for what I did and I took responsibility for shooting carrie. But you made it impossible for me not to do that. You showed me how to grow up, dad. I love you.",
        "Josh: I love you, too, sweetheart.",
        "Reva: What did you find?",
        "Harley: Oh, I don't know. Maybe something, maybe nothing.",
        "Reva: This looks like a bunch of ledgers, paperwork.",
        "Harley: Ledgers, but they belong to the vanishing vanquo.",
        "Reva: The illusionist from the sign?",
        "Harley: Yes.",
        "Reva: Oh, cool.",
        "Harley: I was looking and you seem like you really got something from that sign. So I started sniffing around here, I found this trunk and boom, right there in the box, all these ledgers. See, you had the psychic experience and I am going to check the hard evidence.",
        "Reva: Teamwork.",
        "Harley: Exactly.",
        "Reva: Mm-hmm.",
        "Harley: And I've got all this fun bedtime reading for the next few nights. What do you say we get out of here?",
        "Reva: Now you're reading my mind. It's getting a little crowded.",
        "Doris: Officer. Excuse me, ms. Cooper.",
        "Harley: Yeah.",
        "Reva: So what are you doing here?",
        "Doris: I'm researching a case.",
        "Harley: A case, huh?",
        "Doris: Yeah, I'm taking over the caruther's case.",
        "Harley: Why you?",
        "Doris: The district attorney has recused himself. It seems he has a conflict of interest. It's in all of the papers. Why don't you pick one up on your way home and read all about it.",
        "Harley: Well, maybe we're not ready to go home just yet.",
        "Doris: I'll have to insist. This is a crime scene.",
        "Reva: Well, no, crime actually was committed here. It was self defense.",
        "Doris: Mr. O'neill has already briefed me on the particulars. And I've ready your daughter's statements.",
        "Reva: Then you'll see the distinction I'm trying to make.",
        "Doris: I'm really not at liberty to discuss an active case. You understand. Good evening.",
        "Harley: Don't let her get to you. That's what she wants. And hey, I am telling you, she may be tough, but dovis wolfe is fair.",
        "Reva: I just get a really bad feeling from her. And I got it before she ever even showed up. Marah. I've got to get home. We'll talk later.",
        "Harley: Reva... hey, try not to worry!",
        "Frank: You busy?",
        "Jeffrey: I'm always busy, frank. But I know what? I'm glad you're here, because...",
        "Frank: Yeah, I know. You recused yourself.",
        "Jeffrey: Wow, news spreads fast around here.",
        "Frank: Yes. Yes, it sure does. Are those the case records?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, I'm pulling them together for doris wolfe. That's right. I've assigned her the case. What a mess, huh? Paperwork, I mean.",
        "Frank: Look, jeffrey, for what it's worth, I think you did a damn good job preventing this from becoming a big mess.",
        "Jeffrey: I appreciate that, frank.",
        "Frank: Pretty rough what's going on out there.",
        "Jeffrey: I've been through worse just not lately. You know what I mean? But you know what, frank? Let them fire away at me that way it'll take the focus off of marah.",
        "Frank: Well, you know that wouldn't happen, right?",
        "Jeffrey: No. We got to hope for the best. We hope that doris does her homework, that she sees the light and that she lets this thing just fade away like it should. But I've got to admit it's not as black and white as I'd like it to be, you know. You twist some of this stuff the wrong way and it could make marah look pretty bad if you were so inclined.",
        "Frank: Well, you don't think doris wolfe would do something like that, do you?",
        "Jeffrey: I'm not going to let her. I'm not going to let her, frank. Marah didn't murder anybody. And I'm going to make sure that that's the official conclusion no matter what I do.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, please don't walk away from this.",
        "Cassie: Oh, why not?",
        "Edmund: We have to discuss it.",
        "Cassie: What's left to say? You pulled a vintage edmund. You had jeffrey o'neill investigated behind his back, behind my back. And you're not sorry about it and you'll do it again. So that just sums it up.",
        "Edmund: No, it doesn'T.",
        "Cassie: What am I missing?",
        "Edmund: The context. Would look into jeffrey o'neill's past again? Yes, I would, cassie. The results bare me out.",
        "Cassie: Oh, god. Because it's the whole cia cowboy thing?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I don't know who this man really is. For that matter, I don't know who christopher langham is either.",
        "Cassie: Oh,, come on, edmund, what's the threat? Huh? What are they going to do? They're going to whisk reva away to some undisclosed location and put a whole bunch of microchips in her brain and make her some agency robot, is that it?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, all I'm saying... all I'm saying, cassie, is that reva has put her trust in langham. And his shared past with jeffrey o'neill, if that has any baring on the work they're doing now...",
        "Cassie: It could mean trouble for reva.",
        "Edmund: Exactly.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Okay. All right.",
        "Edmund: And that is what I'm concerned about.",
        "Cassie: Fine. I will look into it. I really don't have a choice since you have shoved all this information down my throat. And you know what? Even if you're right, even if this does help reva, that's not why I'm upset, edmund. I'm upset because the first twinge of insecurity that you had, you went to straight to your henchmen and you had them do your dirty work. So I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing this for reva.",
        "Reva: Hey. Is marah here?",
        "Josh: Yeah, she's upstairs. Have you seen the paper?",
        "Reva: Yeah, I read them. They're also playing the story about every ten minutes on newsradio.",
        "Josh: You know what? It may not be as bad as we think it is.",
        "Reva: Oh, no. Oh, it's as bad. Doris wolfe has the case now.",
        "Josh: What are you talking about?",
        "Reva: I guess that hasn't made the headlines.",
        "Josh: Where did you hear that?",
        "Reva: Miss wolfe. I talked to her. Actually, she talked to me with that same tight little smile she always gives me.",
        "Josh: Reva, I really think it's going to be okay.",
        "Reva: I don't think so. The woman hates me.",
        "Josh: Reva, come on.",
        "Reva: No, joshua, I was responsible indirectly for ruining her career. When she couldn't convict me in richard's death, that set her up for jeffrey to come in and take over her job as da.",
        "Josh: Reva...",
        "Reva: No, this is what it's about, joshua. She's bad. She's trouble. I could feel it in my bones. She's going after marah, because she's trying to come after me. I know it.",
        "Frank: All right, well, here you go. More bad news. I jut got a call from doris wolfe. She's talking about convening a grand jury for the caruthers case or at least reserving the option to.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, she's leaving no stone unturned, isn't she?",
        "Frank: No, she's not.",
        "Harley: Next on \"guiding light.\"",
        "Alexandra: And you know what they say. Lost sons, they come and go, but sisters are forever.",
        "Alan: Is that what they say?",
        "Jeffrey: I want to talk about your undercover work at spaulding.",
        "Gus: What about it?",
        "Jeffrey: You're fired."
