        "Tony: How much longer, Marah?",
        "Marah: Don't worry. You're doing great.",
        "Tony: Yeah, thanks. But that's not what I asked.",
        "Marah: Not that much longer.",
        "Tony: Come on, I got an itch.",
        "Marah: All right. Where?",
        "Tony: My nose. Come here. (Laughter)",
        "Marah: Mm. That's not fair. You moved.",
        "Tony: Are you complaining?",
        "Marah: No.",
        "Tony: Sorry. I just needed a break.",
        "Marah: It's okay. I pretty much got everything I needed anyway.",
        "Tony: Good. Because I felt really stupid posing like that.",
        "Marah: Well, you looked great. You are the perfect model for the concept I'm using for Eden's logo.",
        "Tony: Don't remind me. I still hate the idea that you're getting mixed up in Eden's escort service.",
        "Marah: I'm not getting mixed in it. I'm just designing her business cards.",
        "Tony: Stop. I don't trust that chick.",
        "Marah: Well, you know what? Neither do I. But this is my first chance to go pro with my art. It's a really good experience for me, Tony. And it sounds like her business is legit. And it's not like she hired me as an escort. I mean she hired me because of my talent.",
        "Tony: Yeah, right.",
        "Marah: Excuse me?",
        "Tony: Marah, come on, look, I know. You're talented. But Eden didn't hire you because of that. She doesn't care about that. This is about me. It's always been about me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ben: You lied to me, Eden.",
        "Eden: What is your problem?",
        "Ben: You lied to me! You told me that there was no sex involved in this job.",
        "Eden: There's not.",
        "Ben: Oh, yeah? Yeah? Well, Ramona missed the memo.",
        "Eden: Ben, I do not send my escorts out for sex. You are an adult and so is Mrs. Hendon. After your appointment, you guys can do whatever you want, including each other.",
        "Ben: Don't. Don't, okay? I get it. But I did not sign on to be a gigolo.",
        "Eden: Gigolo? Do people even use that word anymore?",
        "Ben: Eden, I'm not in the mood for this right now.",
        "Eden: Ben, calm down, all right? Look, I want my escorts to be happy just as much as my clients, okay? If you're not happy and you don't ever want to work for me again, then you just let me know. (Phone rings) Hello?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: You knew my mother pretty well.",
        "Lucia: Yes. How is she?",
        "Gus: She's dead. So is my father.",
        "Alexandra: Well, I see you let yourself in. Who are we arresting today? The cook, the baker, the candlestick maker?",
        "Gus: Oh, stop it, Alexandra. I come in peace.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, well, you're in a good mood.",
        "Gus: Oh, yeah, you know, cause a little vacation will do that for you.",
        "Alexandra: Good you needed one. You and Harley.",
        "Gus: I know. And she loves Germany this time of year. So nippy. (Both laugh nervously) And we located your old friend Roy Baker.",
        "Alexandra: Ah.",
        "Gus: You remember Roy? My Uncle Roy? And he confirmed the fact that Miguel Santos is my father.",
        "Alexandra: Of course he would. It's the truth. Of course you don't want to believe me.",
        "Gus: Right. There's just one other thing that has me a little stumpedified.",
        "Alexandra: Really? What's that?",
        "Gus: Well, why you, a Spaulding would go through so much trouble to keep from me, a Santos, from finding out the truth. I'm thinking there's something else you're hiding.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, secrets are funny things, aren't they?",
        "Gus: Yeah, they're hysterical.",
        "Alexandra: First, I want you to know that I never meant to do anyone any harm-- you, Harley, anyone.",
        "Gus: Mm.",
        "Alexandra: It's just that I was desperate to keep the truth from coming out.",
        "Gus: Really?",
        "Alexandra: Yes.",
        "Gus: But why would it matter so much to you if I find out that Miguel Santos is my father?",
        "Alexandra: Because this is not about your father, it's about your mother.",
        "Gus: Oh, right. I'm sure that you and Regina were such good friends, right? Because we all know how well Spaulding's treat their servants. That's why you kicked her out.",
        "Alexandra: Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. You see, this is exactly what happens when Harley goes off to do your sleuthing. I warned you that you would only find out something that would hurt, Gus. Now, look, you're bitter, you're angry, and you don't even know the facts.",
        "Gus: Well, why don't you just straighten me out, Alexandra.",
        "Alexandra: Yes, Gina, was more than a servant in the Spaulding house. She was my friend, too. Yes, she was a nanny; I was a Spaulding. (Laughs) But we were close enough in age where we hit it off.",
        "Gus: Right. And I'm sure that your father, the big, patriarch Spaulding, didn't have any problem with you hanging around with the servants.",
        "Alexandra: My father... (laughs) Treated me like the help, my dear. Every Spaulding woman was treated like a second class citizen. So you see, Regina and I both understood this, and I think that's why we understood each other.",
        "Gus: I see. So where did it all go so wrong?",
        "Alexandra: Your mother had a soft spot for bad boys.",
        "Gus: You're talking about Miguel Santos.",
        "Alexandra: Mm. Yes. And when she got pregnant with his child, well, she was forced to leave the house. I mean, we can't-- family reputation and all-- have a pregnant nanny, Phillip's nanny running around here carrying a mobster's child.",
        "Gus: So she ran to Miguel Santos?",
        "Alexandra: No. No, she went to the police. She knew Miguel was a bad guy. (Laughs) But she didn't want you growing up anywhere near that life.",
        "Gus: So that's when Roy Baker and Joe Augustino faked her death?",
        "Alexandra: No. The only way that Gina could ever think of just to protect you, to protect herself from Miguel. And then of course she got sick. She died less than a year later.",
        "Gus: So that's when Joe and Angela took me in?",
        "Alexandra: Look, your mother made me promise on her death bed, I would never tell you who you are. And that's all I've been trying to do, Gus. I just been trying to keep my promise. You know, you made a promise to Joe. And keeping your promise, you know, prompted the whole custody lawsuit of Harley's, didn't it? My secret has what? Just brought us here. Now the secrets out, okay? And I, for one, am delighted.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Hey, little sister.",
        "Harley: Hey.",
        "Frank: Where's Gus? He's not with you?",
        "Harley: No. Why?",
        "Frank: Well, because Eden's been calling like crazy and she seems really upset. So what's going on?",
        "Harley: Long story.",
        "Frank: (Sighs) Well, I guess. So I take it you don't mind her calling just as long as that it's from far, far away. (Laughter)",
        "Harley: I wish. Eden's back in Springfield.",
        "Frank: What? What? Pull some more dirty tricks?",
        "Harley: Interesting you've choose the words tricks.",
        "Frank: Another long story?",
        "Harley: Another long story. I got a question for you, Frank. Frank all right.",
        "Harley: What if I weren't your sister?",
        "Frank: What?",
        "Harley: I mean what if you found out that you and I weren't really brother and sister? Do you think that would change how things are between us?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: So, I was thumbing through the Springfield phonebook this morning.",
        "Mole: Let my fingers do the walking. Kinky, my friend.",
        "Sandy: Like I was saying there's a biz in town: Garden of Eden. I'm thinking florist, right? But the ad says: \"For the discerning gentlemen or ladies.\"",
        "Shayne: What's up? Can I get a glass of...",
        "Marina: Shh!",
        "Sandy: I gave the place a ring. It turns out it's an escort service. I thought it'd be a great opportunity for you, Mole.",
        "Mole: Yeah. Well, I am escort material. I know how to show a lady a good time.",
        "Sandy: (Laughs) No. Who's going to pay you for a date, Mole? I'm thinking you'd be the one buying.",
        "Mole: Ha, ha, ha.",
        "Marina: Stop. Don't touch me.",
        "Mole: Hey, Sandy, just think with the Garden of Eden in town you may not have to bring that blow-up doll as your date for spring break this year.",
        "Sandy: Dude, I'm shutting you up with a commercial.",
        "Shayne: (Laughs)",
        "Marina: Well, well, well, well, if ain't Mr. Big League himself.",
        "Shayne: So can I get my glass of water now?",
        "Marina: Well, I don't know, Shayne. Shall I put that on your charge?",
        "Shayne: Since when do I have to pay for tap water at Company?",
        "Marina: Well, you know, you ordered up that big truck load desserts at the Country Club the other day, left me with the tab.",
        "Shayne: I told the waiter to put it on my family account.",
        "Marina: Uh-huh. You want to consider speaking up a little next time, because apparently nobody heard you?",
        "Shayne: Oh, no. Are you serious?",
        "Marina: Yeah, you know, don't worry about it though. Ben showed up and saved the day. Good thing for you he showed up, too. If he hadn't, I'd probably still be at the club washing dishes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eden: Guess who just called?",
        "Ben: Who?",
        "Eden: Mrs. Hendon, speak of the devil. And again, she had nothing to say but fabulous things about Benjamin. I knew you would be good at this. Come on, Ben, don't look so depressed. Greatness is rewarded. Let's just say this is a bonus for bringing in repeat business.",
        "Ben: Look, Ramona... Mrs. Hendon said something to me about working on a weekly basis, and she made it very clear to me that she would tip me extra for... extra.",
        "Eden: Well, that's completely up to you, but it sounds like a pretty sweet deal to me. I mean Mrs. Hendon has tons of cash, and a lot of time on her hands. Look, Ben, you can take this money with no hard feelings. I understand this job isn't for everyone. I mean if you feel uncomfortable, you can go get a job parking cars or flipping burgers and... I mean, you'll only make minimum wage, but, you know, money is not a priority to everyone.",
        "Ben: Tell Mrs. Hendon my schedule is flexible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mole: Let me tell you what I'm going to do you when I...",
        "Tony: See. Even these idiots on the radio know that Eden's business is shady.",
        "Marah: They make fun of everybody.",
        "Tony: You know, I don't get why everybody is so into this talk show.",
        "Marah: You know, I kind of like it.",
        "Tony: Yeah, but you also think that Eden hired you because of your designing talents.",
        "Marah: Whoa! Okay, why are we back on this subject? I thought we dropped it.",
        "Tony: I wasn't done talking about it before.",
        "Marah: Well, I was finished talking about it before. Look, is it really that difficult for you to believe that she hired me because of my talent? Babe, I'm not fond of her either, okay? But when she appreciated my work, it made me feel really good. It made me proud of what I could do.",
        "Tony: You should be proud. Baby, you are so talented. Along with the other amazing talents that you have. But Eden doesn't care about that. All she cares about is that your my girlfriend. She's doing this in order to get closer to me.",
        "Marah: Okay. Okay, let's pretend that you're right. Let's pretend that even though, she hasn't asked about you or mentioned you and even though she wants her business to be really successful, let's just say that she hired me to hang around you.",
        "Tony: Okay.",
        "Marah: Okay?",
        "Tony: Mm-hmm.",
        "Marah: So what?",
        "Tony: So what? Marah, the girl is dangerous.",
        "Marah: Eden's dangerous? How? Sweetie, she can't touch this, okay?",
        "Tony: Okay.",
        "Marah: Okay?",
        "Tony: Okay.",
        "Marah: All right. Are you hungry? I think we should go get some lunch.",
        "Tony: Yeah.",
        "Marah: I'm going to buy my pretty little model some lunch, okay?",
        "Tony: Yeah, pretty.",
        "Marah: I'm going to go upstairs and get ready. (Screams)",
        "Tony (disguising his voice): Yes, I would like to order an escort.",
        "Eden: So you're interested in reserving one of our escorts, Mister...",
        "Tony (disguising voice): I thought this was anonymous?",
        "Eden: It is. But I have to know to whom to send the young lady to.",
        "Tony: Mr. Sofa.",
        "Eden: Well, what kind of women do you like, Mr. Sofa?",
        "Tony: Well, she has to be blonde and you know, like the girl-next-door type. And she has to be a classy woman. I will be taking her with me on a trip to Las Vegas. So she has to know how to act in front of important people.",
        "Eden: I think I know just the person for you. She's recently become associated with Garden of Eden, but in a different capacity. But I think she's ready to expand her horizons very soon.",
        "Tony: And this woman, she will be spending a few nights with me.",
        "Eden: Sure. You pay, her day and nights are included.",
        "Tony: And she will satisfy my needs.",
        "Eden: I think you have the wrong idea about my services, Mr. Sofa. My girl will only go with you if you arrange separate bedrooms and she is under no obligations to provide you with anything other than good company. The Garden of Eden is not a brothel.",
        "Tony: Right. Thank you very much.",
        "Marah: Hey.",
        "Tony: Hey.",
        "Marah: Who you talking to?",
        "Tony: Oh, I was talking to myself.",
        "Marah: Oh, yeah?",
        "Tony: Yeah.",
        "Marah: Have anything interesting to say?",
        "Tony: Yeah, I'm really hungry. Are you ready to go or what?",
        "Marah: Yes, let's go.",
        "Tony: All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: You know, maybe money isn't everything when you have some, Shayne. It just when you don't, you know, it's a different story. Like that waiter totally embarrassed me.",
        "Shayne: Marina, I'm so, so, so sorry that happened to you at the club.",
        "Marina: Mm-hmm.",
        "Shayne: Listen, I promise I'm totally going to make it up to you, okay?",
        "Marina: Yeah?",
        "Shayne: Uh-huh.",
        "Marah: I don't really think you're going to have time though.",
        "Shayne: Why is that?",
        "Marina: Because you need every spare minute to be working on your pitching motion, wild thing. I did a little research and checked out your stats from summer season. Your walk numbers were a little bit high.",
        "Shayne: You looked up my stats, huh?",
        "Marina: Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because I only transferred to Springfield High last year, so I wasn't quite up to par with the baseball legend-- otherwise known as Shayne Lewis.",
        "Shayne: And?",
        "Marina: I wanted to see for myself if you were really worth the hype.",
        "Shayne: And?",
        "Marina: And I look forward to seeing that pitching arm in action.",
        "Jamie: Hi, Shayne. I'm so glad I caught up with you. Hi, Marina.",
        "Marina: Hi.",
        "Shayne: What's up, Jamie? How are you doing?",
        "Jamie: I'm writing this article on the baseball team for the school newspaper and the buzz around the locker room is your the man this season. Are you the man, Shayne?",
        "Shayne: I guess I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: You and I are so much like not to be related. What's going on here? Why are you questioning this brother-sister thing? What are you really worrying about here?",
        "Harley: I'm worrying about Gus and Eden, because they found out that they have a different set of parents.",
        "Frank: Oh, man. That's rough.",
        "Harley: Yes.",
        "Frank: Well, how's Gus taking it?",
        "Harley: Well he's dealing, you know. But Eden is the one, she's a mess.",
        "Frank: Hold on one second. Don't you dare for one second start feeling sorry for her, because she refused to help you get your son back, not to mention how many times she tried to break you guys up.",
        "Harley: Thanks, Frank. I'm not going to be the head of her fan club anytime soon. Believe me. But she's still very important to him in spite of everything. You know, they really... they really raised each other when they were kids.",
        "Frank: Like you and me.",
        "Harley: Exactly like you and me. That's why I understand, because I know how devastated I would be if I found out you weren't really my brother.",
        "Frank: What you and I have and what we share is well beyond our genes. I imagine that Gus is pretty much feeling the same way about Eden right now. Anyway, this whole thing about finding his natural parents, any luck with that?",
        "Harley: If luck would have it. Luck, luck. The search for Gus's parents have taken him someplace, I don't think he wants to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Gus, now that you know that you're a Santos, what will you do about it?",
        "Gus: Well, honestly, Alexandra, what do you care? Huh? All the problems are on my father's side. If I understand you correctly, you were just trying to protect and care about my mother, isn't that right?",
        "Alexandra: Yes, that's right.",
        "Gus: So what's it to you then? I had great adoptive parents. They were fantastic. I just lost them a little too early in life, that's all.",
        "Alexandra: Yeah.",
        "Gus: Things could have been a lot worse for me.",
        "Alexandra: Right. Well, I thinks that's a smart way to look at it, Gus. So, anyway, I'm sorry about the secrets. If there's anything I can do, you let me know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nolan: Here we are.",
        "Lucia: Thank you.",
        "Nolan: I'll take your coat.",
        "Lucia: Yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Well, I'll make sure that your car is brought around.",
        "Gus: Thanks.",
        "Alexandra: It's you.",
        "Lucia: It's me, Alexandra. It's been a long time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamie: That's cool. So now let's talk about my article. How do you get along with the other guys on the team?",
        "Shayne: Good. I mean we're all friends, so it's...",
        "Jamie: So you'd be surprised, I don't know. Let's say the catcher had some gripes about your pitching?",
        "Shayne: What? Is Tommy talking trash about my pitching again?",
        "Jamie: I didn't say that.",
        "Shayne: Let me tell you something, Jamie. The only reason he's doing that is because he's jealous. Coach Hassett pays more attention to me than him. So anyway, like I said I could probably get a little bit of time. Why don't we...",
        "Jamie: Wait. So you're saying the coach is biased? Spending more time with some players than others?",
        "Shayne: No, he's not biased. He's just... he just spends a little more time with the good players than the bad ones.",
        "Marina: Yeah. Okay.",
        "Shayne: So why don't we--",
        "Marina: Okay. You know what? You know what, guys? This interview is over.",
        "Jamie: Says who?",
        "Marina: So Shayne Lewis's personal press agent. That would be me.",
        "Shayne: Marina.",
        "Marina: Okay, what is the deal, Jamie? Are you going to... are you going to give your phone number to Shayne so you guys could go out or not?",
        "Jamie: But I'm here on assignment for the school paper.",
        "Marina: Yeah, that's kind of what I thought. Could we...",
        "Jamie: Yeah.",
        "Marina: Thanks. Okay, listen, sweetheart. You're dating some frat guy, right? So you're basically just throwing yourself at my friend so you're going to talk trash about the baseball team? Well, you want a really good scoop? I have one for you. How about a gorgeous redhead exposes reporter slutty interview tactics to school paper advisor.",
        "Jamie: That's some headline.",
        "Marina: Yeah, isn't it?",
        "Jamie: Yeah, fine.",
        "Marina: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jamie: See you around.",
        "Shayne: Thank you. Thanks a lot. Thank you.",
        "Marina: You're welcome.",
        "Shayne: I'm being sarcastic, Marina. You just blew my chances with Jamie, Marina.",
        "Marina: I just saved you from looking like you were a complete tool. Oh, you have got to swipe that smug grin off your face, because you owe me.",
        "Shayne: It's okay. It's okay, I get it now. I get it.",
        "Marina: What? What do you get?",
        "Shayne: I get it.",
        "Marina: You get what?",
        "Shayne: You, Marina Cooper are jealous. You're jealous.",
        "Marina: (Scoffs)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Well, then you and Gus have to be totally psyched that you found out who his natural parents are.",
        "Harley: I think we'd be more psyched if it didn't turn out to be them. Anyway what time is it? I got to go. I'm sure that Gus is back by now. He might have some new information.",
        "Frank: Good luck, sis.",
        "Harley: Yeah, thanks. I got a feeling we're going to need it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: What are you doing here? Your timing couldn't be worse.",
        "Gus: (Laughs) What are you doing? I thought you had butchers and bakers and candlestick makers do that stuff?",
        "Alexandra: Well, you know sometimes if you want things done right, you have to do them yourself.",
        "Gus: Yeah, Alexandra, I just want you to know that I think I understand why you did what you did.",
        "Alexandra: Good. Well, good-bye, Gus. Give my best to Harley.",
        "Gus: Of course.",

        "Marah: Well, not like kick him down, drag him out type of fights, but yeah, yeah Shayne and I have had our fights.",
        "Eden: But it doesn't really matter because you get over it, because your blood, you're related, right?",
        "Marah: Yeah, of course. Have you even seen Gus since you've been back?",

        "Tony: I'm not talking about any of this with you.",
        "Eden: You know what, Tony? Just to warn you as a friend, what's done is done. And if you don't let it go, you're going to lose your mind and you're going to lose Marah.",

        "Marina: Okay, first of all, you will never again use the word desperate and my name in the same sentence. You know, while we are lying down some ground rules, you should also know that I am in love with Ben, and that you and I have strictly a business friendship.",
