        "Cassie: Tammy? Tammy, are you here? No, Cassie, of course she's not here. Why would she come home to the mother who just locked her in the closet with a corpse.",
        "Josh: Cassie, come on. You took a risk, okay?",
        "Cassie: You think?",
        "Josh: You had to try something. You had to wake her up and make her see what Jonathan is doing in her life.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, well, Josh, it didn't wake her up. In fact, it probably just pushed them closer together. She's God only knows where. She hates me and I may have just lost my daughter for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: You had nothing to do with Sandy's death.",
        "Tammy: So Sandy told me the truth. He really was divorced before we got married.",
        "Jonathan: He thought he was, yes.",
        "Tammy: If you hadn't done what you did. How long did you know about him and Ava?",
        "Jonathan: A month, maybe more.",
        "Tammy: And you didn't tell me.",
        "Jonathan: No, I... I didn't want it to be like that.",
        "Tammy: Didn't want what to be like that?",
        "Jonathan: You wanted to be with me, I knew that, but I wanted you to choose. I wanted you to choose for yourself. I wanted you to make the decision. I don't know. When you didn't make the right choice, I gave you a push.",
        "Tammy: A push? A push?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: You know, we could just stay like this forever. Making love, and never leaving this room.",
        "Alan-Michael: I like the way you think, Cooper.",
        "Marina: In fact, but before this, you blew me off, Alan-Michael. You gave me this big ol' speech about how things would never work out between us. And if I remember correctly, you just walked away from me.",
        "Alan-Michael: I did that? I did, but then you tracked me down and made me see what a fool I've been, and I've regretted every word.",
        "Marina: Are you sure? Because, um, I need to know if you eventually do walk out of here, are you just going to bail out on me again?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Alan, we really didn't have to come back here.",
        "Alan: Beth, you are carrying my child and I'm very concerned about that cough. I just want to make sure you both are doing well.",
        "Beth: Oh, the look on people's faces when they see you.",
        "Alan: Priceless, isn't it?",
        "Beth: Except they keep looking for Gus, too.",
        "Alan: Well let them.",
        "Beth: You know, Harley and Mallet did not buy our story.",
        "Alan: I'm not worried.",
        "Beth: They're not going to let this go.",
        "Alan: Well at least we have a little time till they return.",
        "Beth: What did you do?",
        "Alan: I have a phone call to make. Excuse me.",
        "Beth: Oh, boy-- or girl.",
        "Dinah: Beth, hi. Have you seen Mallet or Harley?",
        "Beth: Why would I know where they are? ( Heavy breathing )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Three guesses who swiped the starter from our car.",
        "Mallet: Alan, Alan, or could it be Alan.",
        "Harley: Since when does it take three hours for a tow truck to arrive?",
        "Mallet: Because the nearest gas station is 20 miles away. And it's a lousy night. And they're probably swamped.",
        "Harley: I don't care. I'm cold; I'm tired. I just learned that my husband is dead again.",
        "Mallet: I know, I'm sorry.",
        "Harley: I want to go home.",
        "Mallet: I know, I'm sorry. There's just nothing else we can do but wait, okay?",
        "Harley: Do you believe what Alan told us?",
        "Mallet: I don't know.",
        "Harley: He's lied before. Let me get the blankets in the other room.",
        "Mallet: All right. You know, the tow truck could come sooner than they said. If you had to be stuck with somebody, I mean, who would you rather have it be anyone, except you know, than me.",
        "Harley: I'm letting go, okay. This is me letting go. Gus is gone. He's gone. No more false hope. I can't do it anymore. No more investigation. No more. Just no more!",
        "Marina: So... you tried to get rid of me and now here we are.",
        "Alan-Michael: I wish I could tell you this is part of the plan, but...",
        "Marina: What plan? I know. I'm sorry, I should just stop talking and be here.",
        "Alan-Michael: But you want to know why I've been holding back, giving you mixed signals.",
        "Marina: It might help.",
        "Alan-Michael: I want you, Marina. God, I want you. But... there are other things that I want, too, and--",
        "Marina: You keep saying that. What other things? I make things so damn complicated. Last night when I said the \"L\" word, you panicked.",
        "Alan-Michael: Maybe a little bit, but not because I don't care about you, because...",
        "Marina: I know.",
        "Alan-Michael: It's complicated.",
        "Marina: I know, it's complicated. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Alan-Michael: I don't want to answer that, but...",
        "Marina: Go ahead. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Alan-Michael: Alan-Michael Spaulding.",
        "Alan: Well, son, it's been a while.",
        "Alan-Michael: Dad?",
        "Alan: I'm touched that you recognize my voice.",
        "Alan-Michael: What... how... where are you?",
        "Alan: It is a long story, and I can't wait to tell you all about it, but right now I'm at Cedars doting on your very pregnant stepmother, but we'll talk soon. We have a lot to catch up on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Beth, when you skipped out...",
        "Beth: I didn't really skip out.",
        "Dinah: Okay. Harley and Mallet were following you.",
        "Beth: Yes, and they found me. That reminds me, look what I found in my coat pocket, is that yours. I hear they can track those things.",
        "Dinah: Good, it worked. Look, they thought you were lying to them about Gus and Alan. So why don't you tell me where you led them to?",
        "Alan: She led them to me. Hello, Dinah. You know the reports of my demise are very premature.",
        "Dinah: Alan, what are you doing here? Where's Gus?",
        "Alan: Gus didn't survive the accident; he's gone.",
        "Dinah: Does Harley know about this?",
        "Beth: Yes, yes, she does know. But don't worry, Mallet is there to comfort her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Come on, I'll get you in front of the fire, okay?",
        "Harley: It's over, isn't it? I mean it's really over. All of the weeks-- months now-- hoping and praying. That's what kept me alive, you know? That hope. That rush and hope. And I don't know what I am without it, you know. I don't know who I am. What am I going to do?",
        "Mallet: Down the road, I don't know. But right now, we've got to get you warm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Thank you, Josh, but you know you really-- you don't have to stick around.",
        "Josh: No, no. Cassie, you know what, I am not going to leave you alone this time, all right? You don't want company, that's fine. I just uh... I just can go in the other room and read a book, or something like that. Or, if you need me to do something around the house, I can do that, too. How about these boxes right here, huh? Where are they going the attic, huh?",
        "Cassie: Don't, Josh. Just um... leave these. These are the last of Jeffrey's things. He keeps offering to pick them up, and I keep putting him off.",
        "Josh: It sounds like you're not sure if you did the right thing.",
        "Cassie: No, I still love Jeffrey, but...",
        "Josh: But you can't forgive him?",
        "Cassie: It's not about forgiving, Josh, it's about forgetting. Every time I'm with him, everything he says, every time he touches me, what he did will be between us. It hasn't just scarred us, it scarred my memories from Richard, too.",
        "Josh: I'm sorry, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Well, you know what it's like to have to move on, don't you?",
        "Josh: Well, to try, anyway.",
        "Cassie: I thought you had decided you couldn't be with Reva?",
        "Josh: Yeah. The accident, it um-- it, um, changed some things, you know, in my mind.",
        "Cassie: Almost losing someone will do that to you. So does this mean you and Reva will...",
        "Josh: You know what? Right now, all I care about is you being okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: You let me stand up there in front of everybody and be humiliated. That was the worst day of my life.",
        "Jonathan: Mine, too. How do you think it felt to watch you make that choice to, choose him, to stand there in that dress and say those words to him?",
        "Tammy: You want me to feel bad for you?",
        "Jonathan: No, I want you to understand, just like I wanted you to understand back then. You belong with me. You belong with me.",
        "Tammy: That's insane. Insane.",
        "Jonathan: Tell me how you felt after all of the lies and garbage told you? Tell me how you felt when you walked out of that church and you saw me there?",
        "Tammy: It doesn't matter. I doesn't change what you did. It should have been my choice to end things with Sandy.",
        "Jonathan: What does it matter how things happened, as long as the end result is the same? Forget about Sandy. You wanted to be with me and now we're together.",
        "Tammy: Oh, my God, you really don't get it?",
        "Jonathan: No, I don't.",
        "Tammy: You don't think you did anything wrong? That you hurt me? You hurt me, Jonathan. You put me through hell, and you knew it when you were doing it, and you didn't even give a damn. Did it ever occur to you that maybe Sandy wouldn't have gone crazy if you didn't do what he did? Maybe he wouldn't have gone off that cliff right now, maybe he wouldn't be dead right, and maybe I wouldn't be...",
        "Jonathan: All right, stop. Stop. Look, I am sorry that you were hurt. But I did it because of this, because of us. You're meant to be with me, Tammy. I know it and you know it. We belong together. We are what's right. Nothing else matters and whatever had to happen to get us here, it had to happen.",
        "Tammy: When I came out of the church and saw you that day waiting for me, I thought it was fate. But it wasn't fate. You planned it, you set the whole thing up. I thought you were my savior, I thought you were my hero.",
        "Jonathan: No, I never once pretended to be your hero. You didn't want me to be one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: So this is it, the weapon that Jeffrey O'Neill uses to get the chicks. Did he ever write a song for you?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, a few.",
        "Josh: Yeah? ( Guitar tuning )",
        "Cassie: Reva never told me you played?",
        "Josh: Well, she doesn't know. I mean, I strummed a little bit in high school and played a little in college, that kind of thing.",
        "Cassie: Oh, yeah, so you could get the chicks?",
        "Josh: Absolutely.",
        "Cassie: You know, sometimes I've got to say I think my life would make a pretty good country song.",
        "Josh: Yes, I think you're right. Let's see, you've got uh... you've got a husband in jail, you've got cousins in love with each other, a sister you're not talking to and you've got boyfriend issues. You've got it all going on. Sounds good.",
        "Cassie: Are you trying to depress me?",
        "Josh: Oh, give me a home where my exes don't roam and they don't lock me in a tower all day where they don't lie and cheat or try to sweep me off my feet...",
        "Cassie: ( Laughs )",
        "Josh: Yeah, that wasn't very good, was it? Or work for the damn CIA...",
        "Cassie: I'm not sure that's funny.",
        "Josh: This is good. Home, home on the farm where my husband set fire to my barn...",
        "Cassie: ( Laughing )",
        "Josh: Where I fight with my sis and my daughter I miss because she and her cousin...",
        "Cassie: Don't say it. Don't say it.",
        "Josh: Like to kiss.",
        "Cassie: No! Stop it! ( Laughter ) I will break this over your head.",
        "Josh: Look, you're laughing. You're laughing and I haven't seen you do that in a really long time and that's a really good thing. How about an encore, huh?",
        "Cassie: No! No, no!",
        "Josh: Come on!",
        "Cassie: There are limits.",
        "Josh: I thought I sounded pretty darn good.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, well, you did good. You're right, I haven't laughed in I don't know how long. You're just a really good friend, Josh.",
        "Josh: You deserve a really good friend, Cassie. In fact, you deserve a whole lot more.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: You wanted me, not some cleaned up, fixed version of me. You know who I am, who I've always been, a guy who scares you a little, a guy who is a little different from the people that you're used to. You wanted to be with me and that's who I was, a guy who would fight to the death for you and I still haven't changed.",
        "Tammy: No. You haven't. You hurt me just like you did when you came to town as J.B.",
        "Jonathan: What I did back then I did out of hate. What I did now I did out of love.",
        "Tammy: That's supposed to make me feel better?",
        "Jonathan: Look, I did what I did so we could be together. I don't care what happened because it got us--",
        "Tammy: Here. On this cliff where Sandy died?! That's where it got us.",
        "Jonathan: No, it got us into the hotel room last night where we made promises to each other.",
        "Tammy: Lies. Promises based on lies.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, come on, you think this is all lies. You made some choices of your own, too, Tammy. You chose to leave your mother's house; you were ready to go to jail with me. You stood up and told the whole town that you loved me. Not because I forced you to; because you wanted to. Because you love me. You love me as much as I love you. And that has not changed. That will never change. You love me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Well, it is a good thing I returned that cell phone to you. Now you can use it to call Harley and your boyfriend.",
        "Dinah: Alan, where are they?",
        "Alan: I'm sorry, I wouldn't know. Well, what a surprise. Glad to see me, son?",
        "Alan-Michael: Of course I am. This is-- Dad, this is amazing.",
        "Beth: Alan, they're ready for me.",
        "Alan: I'll be right in.",
        "Dinah: I don't know about you guys, but I don't know if I'm believing what I'm seeing.",
        "Alan-Michael: No, I'm in shock.",
        "Marina: You know what, why don't we give them some time? I'll be outside.",
        "Alan-Michael: Thanks.",
        "Alan: Don't you think you should be nicer to your boss?",
        "Alan-Michael: She's not my boss.",
        "Alan: That's not what I hear. Word on the street has it that ever since I've been gone, you've let Spaulding Enterprises go down the tube.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: We've got to get out of these wet clothes, right? We'll wrap ourselves in blankets and we'll dry our clothes in front of the fire, or the tow truck will come-- whatever happens first. But you'll feel a lot better if you get warm, okay.",
        "Harley: Damn.",
        "Mallet: What's wrong.",
        "Harley: My fingers are numb. I can't unbutton my jacket.",
        "Mallet: You need some help?",
        "Harley: No, I'll figure it out. Hey, maybe you should, um, you know, call the tow truck company, tell them we're cops.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I did that. And I'll do it again, and then I'll call Dinah.",
        "Harley: Yeah, call Dinah. I'm sure she's wondering where we are.",
        "Mallet: You decent? Cooper! Harley. Hey, hey. I'm here. What are you doing? Let's get warm. Come here.",

        "Mallet: You break my heart.",

        "Mallet: I'm going to... I'm going to go call Dinah, okay?",
        "Harley: I'll get us some food.",
        "Mallet: You okay? Hey, sweetie. How are you? It's me. Anyway, well, I hope you get your cell phone back so you can even get this message, but you won't believe where I am. Anyway, I miss you, and, um... call me as soon as you get this, okay? Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: No, no. You can't do this. Sandy is dead. He's dead, and you act like it doesn't even matter, like we should just forget about everything.",
        "Jonathon: Why not?",
        "Tammy: Why not?",
        "Jonathan: Look, look, I wanted Sandy gone, yes. I thought that that meant he was going to leave town. But, Tammy, if he has to be dead for me to be sure that he can never bother you again, I'm not going to lose any sleep over it. Because you are my only concern. You are my number-one priority. Okay? Let's go.",
        "Tammy: No, don't touch me.",
        "Jonathan: You don't mean that.",
        "Tammy: I'm telling you... I told you. You're just not listening.",
        "Jonathan: Look, you want me to promise that I'll never hurt you again? Because I can't do that. If I ever did hurt you again, it would be because I love you.",
        "Tammy: You sound like Sandy.",
        "Jonathan: Really? If I hurt you again it would be to protect you from things. Because there are different degrees of hurt in this world, Tammy. Trust me, I know. I've been kicked around a lot. I saved Reva from Nate, I save you from Sandy.",
        "Tammy: Only you didn't, Jonathan. 'Cause I killed him.",
        "Jonathan: You didn't kill him. It was an accident!",
        "Tammy: An accident that you set in motion. How can I live with that now? How can I live with what we've done to each other? How can I live with what we did to Sandy? How can I live with you?",
        "Jonathan: Because we belong together.",
        "Tammy: Maybe you can do it that way, but I can't. I can't...",
        "Jonathan: Wait, wait, shh. Wait, what? What are you saying?",
        "Tammy: I'm saying... good- bye.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy. Tammy. Tammy, what the hell!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: Hey, did Beth tell you? Your funeral was weak. No one bothered showing up, not even me. And thanks for shafting me in your will.",
        "Alan: Alan-Michael, you betrayed me. You gave me your word that you were going to help me take back the company and you reneged.",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm sorry. I wanted to work with you, Dad, but it was always Phillip you were grooming, even when he had no interest in the company. And then, of course, Gus got a crack at the top spot-- Gus, who didn't give a damn about business. No... yes, I guess I got tired of begging and took matters into my own hands.",
        "Alan: And you stabbed your old man in your back, didn't you?",
        "Alan-Michael: I learned it from you. You've been stabbing me in the back my whole life. So I carved out a place for myself at Spaulding. Sorry, there's no room for you.",
        "Alan: You haven't carved out a place for yourself at Spaulding, son. You're powerless, a second stringer, and you have to answer to some nut-job.",
        "Dinah: Oh, did I hear my name?",
        "Alan-Michael: You know, most people return from a near-death experience with a new outlook on life, but not Alan Brandon Spaulding. No, he's got his panties in a bunch because you're in the big chair.",
        "Dinah: I'm just keeping that chair warm till Harley returns.",
        "Alan: I'm so happy I'm having another heir.",
        "Dinah: Yes, he or she will be able to take over that throne in, I don't know, what do you think? 30 years or so. Of course, you may not be around by then.",
        "Alan: I wouldn't count on it, Dinah. But I would count on big changes being made at Spaulding very soon.",
        "Dinah: Okay, let me give you a little news update, all right? I may work at the request of Harley, but I'm a hell of a lot scarier than she is. And just because you have now come back from the dead that does not give you a pass to mess with Harley or her family. She's tough, she fights fair, that is unlike myself. So you take your threat and you shove it, because I ain't going anywhere.",
        "Alan-Michael: If you need help finding a job, I know a guy. Of course, you might have to beg.",

        "Jonathan: ( Screaming ) Hey! Hey!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Well, I will take my leave, little lady.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, well, don't you come back until you learn how to harmonize. ( Laughter ) Thank you, Josh. Thanks just for making me feel better than I did when we walked in here.",
        "Tammy: Mom, Mom, you were right about Jonathan! You were so right! ( Crying ) Jonathan knew. He let me marry Sandy. He set up the arrest. All of it. All of it so I would go to him. And that's what started everything-- the fire and jail, Sandy, me losing you, and now, tonight...",
        "Cassie: Sweetie, listen to me. You have not lost me. You never will.",
        "Josh: I'll call you.",
        "Cassie: What can I do for you, honey? Tell me.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan is still that guy who came to town to get revenge, Mom, that angry, scary guy. I can see that now. Yes, there's good in him. There is so much good, so much good, and so much love. I know he loves me. But he hurt me anyway. And that's what you've been trying to tell me all along. That's what you knew would happen. If it was just me who got hurt this time, I... I'd get over it. But Sandy's dead because of me, Mom. Yes, because of me. How do I live with that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: She just needs time. She loves me. ( Sniffs ) She needs me. She needs me! She needs me! (Grunts) ( screaming )",

        "Marina: It didn't look like a very happy reunion.",
        "Alan-Michael: Dear old dad, I should have never thought a brush with death would have changed him. He came after me for not being tough enough, for letting Harley and Dinah grab the big chair instead of me.",
        "Marina: You don't want that, right? Alan-Michael?",
        "Alan-Michael: What? No, of course not. Of course I don't.",

        "Mallet: What are you doing?",
        "Harley: I'm just thinking about what kind of food to rustle up for us. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Mallet: Oh. ( Cell phone ringing ) Hey, Dinah. Hey yeah, good. How are you?",
        "Dinah: Well, forget about me. How are you? I just saw Beth and, amazingly, Alan.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, yeah, that's pretty damn amazing, all right.",
        "Dinah: Gus is gone?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I'm... I'm afraid so.",
        "Dinah: When Harley heard that, she must have thought...",
        "Mallet: Yeah, she... she's been better.",
        "Dinah: So you're with her? You're with her wherever you guys are.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, there's a problem with the car. We're waiting for a tow truck.",
        "Dinah: Are you okay?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, no, I'm fine. I'll make it. It's just... it's just really good to hear your voice. And I just can't wait to come home to you.",

        "Jonathan: Tammy?",
        "Josh: Nope. Sorry, Jonathan. Tammy's not going to be coming back here, I don't think. Wow!",
        "Jonathan: Hey, where is she?",
        "Josh: This is really going to set you back, don't you think?",
        "Jonathan: Hey! You spoke to her. Where is she?",
        "Josh: Yeah, I spoke to her.",
        "Jonathan: So, what? She told you everything? Well, it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm going to get her back.",
        "Josh: No, you're not.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I am. It doesn't matter what you or Cassie or anyone else does. Tammy loves me, and she's going to realize that I did what I did for her!",
        "Josh: Let me put it for you another way, okay? You listen to me. Listen to me now! It's over, Jonathan. You will steer clear of my niece from now on.",
        "Jonathan: Where the hell do you get off telling me what to do? You're not my father.",
        "Josh: Unfortunately, it seems to be the only language that you understand. Now, you think I don't like you, but actually I do. I just don't like what you've done to the people I love.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, Joshua, everybody's big protector, yeah! Okay!",
        "Josh: Stay away from Tammy, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. I will not stay away from Tammy. I will do what I have to do until I can be with her, and there's not a damn thing you can do about it.",
        "Josh: You think so? Don't say I didn't warn you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Sweetie, listen to me. What happened to Sandy is not your fault. It's not, honey. And while I'm certainly no champion of Jonathan's, it's not even his fault either.",
        "Tammy: I chose him over everything, Mom.",
        "Cassie: I know, and... and you still love him.",
        "Tammy: It's not enough. It will never be enough.",
        "Cassie: Honey, as long as you don't blame yourself. Both Jonathan and Sandy have had serious problems, honey, and that is not your fault. You just got caught in the middle. And look, we both made mistakes. I certainly didn't handle this very well, but, honey, look, it's okay. It's over now. You're home, you're here. We're going to get through this together, okay?",

        "Marina: You know what I mean.",
        "Alan-Michael: I thought my father was dead, Marina.",
        "Marina: I know. And you have major issues with him, issues that made you want to bolt before. You're not going to do that again, are you? You're not going to run?",
        "Alan-Michael: No, no, I'm not going to run. I'm going to stay right here and fight for everything that's mine, including you.",

        "Beth: I'm fine. The baby's fine.",
        "Alan: Well, that's good news. And we'll go. It seems I have more problems to solve than I initially thought.",
        "Beth: Gus?",
        "Alan: No, not Gus.",
        "Alan-Michael: Oh, did I mention I'm dating a Cooper?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: So how long will it be until you get the tow truck there?",
        "Mallet: Soon, soon, I hope. I'm sorry I took off the way I did. Yeah, I know. I'm going to make it up to you, though, I promise.",
        "Dinah: Don't worry about it. Just get home as soon as you can, okay?",
        "Mallet: You bet you I will. We've got a problem with the car, though. We have to wait for a part or wait for the tow truck, so it could be till morning. Okay? All right, listen, I should go. I love... I miss you, and I'll call you as soon as I can, okay? All right, bye.",
        "Dinah: Bye. Morning? Okay. Is he sounding guilty or distracted by someone? No. No, because I trust him. I trust him, and he almost said \"I love you,\" didn't you? I almost heard you say \"I love you,\" but that probably is because you feel guilty or something. Hi, this is Miss Marler. Could you please put me through to the parking garage, please? Yeah, hi. Do we have access to a four- wheel drive? Good. I need a pickup in the hills for a Mr. A.C. Mallet. Now. Thank you.",

        "Billy: Meaning what?",
        "Josh: Standing up for Jonathan like that. Do you actually mean what you're saying, or are you just trying to score points with my wife?"
