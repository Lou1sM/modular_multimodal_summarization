        "Olivia: You know what, baby? Ever since I was a little girl, I had this plan. I swore to myself I was going to make everything turn out exactly the way I wanted it to. I was going to have a great life because up until then, it had been anything but. Oh, that's my princess, sh-sh- sh, close your eyes. And that's still the plan, you know. I just haven't found the right guy to help me get to where I want to get to. Richard didn't work out, and Josh the first time, and Alan and Phillip and Bill. But you know what? I'm not giving up because it is a good plan, and I'm sticking to it. All it takes is a little hard work, and I have never been afraid of that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: This is for you...",
        "Olivia: Okay, thanks.",
        "Josh: ...And it looks like this place is going to work out just fine. I've got to say I was a little freaked out when you told me the Beacon had been booked.",
        "Olivia: Well, my hotel is really successful. And I don't think our clients mind stooping to dinner at Towers.",
        "Josh: Certainly not if you're organizing it.",
        "Olivia: Why, thank you, sir. Let me get you some dinner.",
        "Josh: No. Actually, you know what? I've to get to the airport. Martin and Hicks, their flight came in early from Chicago and I have not had a chance to get over there to pick them up because of a family emergency. So they're probably very upset right about now.",
        "Olivia: No, no, because I tracked their flight and had a limo pick them up, take them to the hotel and they're anxiously awaiting a working breakfast with you tomorrow morning to discuss their concerns about the high-rise project. I hope that's okay?",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Olivia: Good-- oh thank you, Stan. Stan, one more thing: A bourbon and branch for Mr. Lewis. Right?",
        "Josh: That would be perfect.",
        "Olivia: Thank you. Have a seat, make yourself comfortable because life is good. Voila.",
        "Josh: I don't know what I would do without you, Olivia. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Ow-- ow! Oh. My toes, toes. Jane!",
        "Emma: Mommy.",
        "Olivia: ( Gasps ) Oh, my goodness, my sweetie. Let's not touch mommy's suit; it's her favorite, okay. Come here.",
        "Jane: Miss Spencer, sorry about the mess. Emma has not... she's been a mess today as you can see.",
        "Olivia: Well that's probably because you're feeding her peanut butter and jelly instead of the veggie-tofu stir-fry I asked you to give her.",
        "Jane: She wouldn't go for the real food; I had to do the pb & j.",
        "Olivia: Em, sweetie, remember we talked about what food is good to eat and what food isn't good to eat? Oh, baby, no oh, oh...",
        "Jane: Here, here, here.",
        "Olivia: You know what? When I clean up, we'll-- well in fact, we'll just play mommy and Emma go to the cleaners. Let's just do that. Why is it I can spearhead a high-rise project but I can't get my daughter fed and in bed at a decent hour? So, we're on for tomorrow night, right?",
        "Jane: Sure.",
        "Olivia: Good. I mean, everything is all squared away, you're going to be here, because I need you to be here.",
        "Jane: Yeah, I will be, I will be. Now if you don't need me for anything else, I'm...",
        "Olivia: No. No, everything is under control. So take off. Wait, hang on. Dinosaur. No, she can't do Saturday morning, she has ballet classes. That is just ugly. Um, the afternoon. The afternoon is good. Good. Thanks, Rachel. Hey! Hey, mommy got you a play-date with Chloe this weekend. Yay! Honey, honey, where is the other shoe? They match, you know, because these are from Italy.",
        "Emma: I can't see it.",
        "Olivia: Okay. Look, this plan I keep talking about, it's not just for me, it's for you, too. Because I want you to have a great life. I want you to have everything I didn't have, you know. I want you to go to the best schools, and have the best clothes and have the best of everything because you're my princess, right? My very sweet princess. (Knock on the door )",
        "Olivia: Finally! Okay. This is the last cheeseburger you get for a while. Tomorrow night, it's tofu.",
        "Emma: No.",
        "Olivia: Tofu. You like tofu.",
        "Delivery man: Ms. Spencer.",
        "Olivia: Yes, thank you. Oh, Josh.",
        "Delivery man: Excuse me. Those are from Chief Frank Cooper.",
        "Olivia: Frank? There you go, here. Thanks. Oh. That's so sweet. ( Knock on the door ) Okay. This is the burger. Buzz.",
        "Buzz: What name are you going by tonight, Cinderella? It's a new look, I like it.",
        "Olivia: Oh, golly, what are you doing making deliveries?",
        "Buzz: My delivery guy's kind of swamped, so I thought I'd pick up the slack. I'll just put it right here, okay?",
        "Olivia: You know what? We're kind of a mess. I wasn't expecting guests.",
        "Buzz: Guests? Guests? I'm a friend. What do you mean, guests?",
        "Olivia: You are. You are a friend who dropped by unexpectedly, and I'm not good with unexpected, so...",
        "Buzz: ( Stammering ) We love surprises. Don't you love-- hey, Emma. Emma, don't we look surprises? Nod, yes. We love-- she loves surprises.",
        "Olivia: No, she does not. She loves-- no! Don't-- no! No, I was going to clean it up.",
        "Buzz: Mine! Mine! What, you know the room's messy. So, it looks like you live here and this is what life does to a room. It can't be picture-perfect every single day.",
        "Olivia: Mine usually is. Usually.",
        "Buzz: Usually? Well, then, I just came in on an off night or a real one. Here. Cooper to Spencer, in for two. Done. Yes, yes, and yes! ( Olivia laughing ) One of the great things of living in a ho--tel is having a vending machine down the hall.",
        "Olivia: Hey, can you say hola to Buzz? Say, hola.",
        "Emma: Hola.",
        "Buzz: Que pasa?",
        "Olivia: Good. It's all part of a plan to improve her mind.",
        "Buzz: What's wrong with the mind that she has?",
        "Emma: Hola.",
        "Olivia: Very good. Nothing. Nothing, I just don't want her to fall behind in her age group.",
        "Buzz: Her age group is four.",
        "Emma: I could fall on my--",
        "Olivia: No. It's not my fault I don't make these things up, you know. It's just everything happens earlier these days-- especially competition. So the more skills she has, the more chance she has of getting a jump-start on her future.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, well, you mean that's the plan that you have like for your future.",
        "Olivia: It's the same thing. Look, she likes to learn and try new things. Why shouldn't it be reflected in her resume?",
        "Buzz: Her what? Her resume? I don't even have a resume. She has a resume?",
        "Olivia: It's all part of the plan.",
        "Buzz: This is the second time you mentioned this mysterious plan.",
        "Olivia: It's not a mystery; I just want her to have the best possible life she can.",
        "Buzz: Oh... oh is there any uh... you know in this plan any fun budgeted in?",
        "Olivia: Uh... do you think she's suffering? I've built plenty of recreational time into her schedule.",
        "Buzz: You built in?",
        "Olivia: Yes.",
        "Buzz: So you planned it.",
        "Olivia: Yes.",
        "Buzz: What about spur of the moment urges to you know, play?",
        "Olivia: Oh, she gets those, trust me.",
        "Buzz: You don't look happy about it. When was the last time you did anything spontaneous?",
        "Olivia: You ought to know, you were there.",
        "Buzz: When was the last time you did anything silly, and don't say it was the same night.",
        "Olivia: I gave up silly when Bill left.",
        "Buzz: It's time to try, try again. Okay, honey.",
        "Olivia: What are you doing?",
        "Buzz: Come on. Let's get your overcoat. We're going to go-- how would you like to go on a carousel ride? Okay?",
        "Olivia: Really?",
        "Buzz: Really. It's time momma has the guts for plan \"B.\"",
        "Olivia: \"B\"?",
        "Emma: Are the horses sick?",
        "Buzz: No, they're just resting.",
        "Olivia: You planned this on the carousel and you didn't want her to be disappointed.",
        "Buzz: Just go with the flow, okay? Which one is your favorite? That's my favorite, too. What do you think her name is?",
        "Emma: Snowball.",
        "Buzz: Snowball! Let's go find out. Hey, Snowball, Snowball, you want to give Emma a ride? She does. Here, give me your hand. Watch out, Emma.",
        "Olivia: Not a word.",
        "Buzz: Faster, Snowball, faster! Faster, faster, faster! Hey, Snowball's a magic horse, you know that? You did? You know, if you say so, she can go fly right up in the sky. All you got to do is say, up, up, up.",
        "Emma: Up, up, up.",
        "Buzz: Up, up-- whoa! Gee. Would you rather ride a horse or have an ice cream sundae?",
        "Olivia: Oh, ice cream.",
        "Emma: Ice cream.",
        "Buzz: Yeah!",
        "Olivia: We'll have to do room service, okay? She's got school tomorrow.",
        "Buzz: Oh, pre-school. She'll be okay.",
        "Olivia: Say good-bye to Snowball.",
        "Buzz: Oh, you know what? Here's a brass ring. You didn't even have to reach for it.",
        "Olivia: Well, that's the first time that that's happened.",
        "Buzz: Yeah. Hey, I know I'm not as fast or as pretty as Snowball, but would you take a ride with me? Huh? Hop on, come on. Hop on. Oh, here we go.",
        "Olivia: Have you ever seen a little girl smile in her sleep?",
        "Buzz: I have, actually.",
        "Olivia: You're great with her.",
        "Buzz: Oh, it's nothing. It's just... she's a sweetheart.",
        "Olivia: It means a lot to both of us. You know, it's been hard since Bill has been gone. You know between Lewis and the Beacon, I'm working ungodly hours. I don't get to spend a lot of time with her. And that's why I plan all of these activities, because I don't want her to feel lonely, like she's missing out or anything.",
        "Buzz: Well of course she's missing you. You're her mother, she loves you. You love her. But you know, you've got a lot on your plate.",
        "Olivia: I've got a lot of commitments, I do. I've got this thing at Towers tonight, this dinner for Lewis and in the morning I have a conference with Emma's teacher, which I'm really nervous about.",
        "Buzz: She's aces, come on.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, but if her teacher doesn't think so, it could effect her entire future.",
        "Buzz: Oh, my-- here we go again.",
        "Olivia: It's true. If she doesn't get into the right grade school, because of poor performance, it could really ruin everything.",
        "Buzz: She is going to be fine! Emma's going to be fine.",
        "Olivia: I can't take words; I need guarantees! I want the best for my little girl, and that's exactly what she is going to have.",
        "Buzz: I'll make you a deal, okay? If you want, I'll go with you to the teacher conference tomorrow.",
        "Olivia: You will?",
        "Buzz: Yeah. I mean, what are friends for?",
        "Olivia: You are such a great friend.",
        "Buzz: A friend. Well, on that high note, see you tomorrow.",
        "Olivia: Buzz, I had a nice, nice time tonight.",
        "Buzz: You know, actually, me, too.",
        "Olivia: Oh.",
        "Buzz: What?",
        "Olivia: I'm bad. Why do you let me walk around like this?",
        "Buzz: I think that you look like a princess, only more beautiful. More beautiful even than those flowers.",
        "Olivia: Well, Frank sent those.",
        "Buzz: See you tomorrow.",
        "Olivia: \"I saw these flowers and thought of you, both equally amazing.\" Frank.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Emma only got an \"S\" in art?",
        "Buzz: An \"S\" as in...",
        "Teacher: For \"satisfactory.\"",
        "Olivia: She got E's in everything else?",
        "Buzz: \"E\", that would be for excellent, right? I mean that would be--",
        "Olivia: She's incredibly artistic. I mean she has been exposed to art since she was born-- before she was born. I listened to classical music everyday when I was pregnant.",
        "Teacher: When we finger painted, Emma smeared the paints all over the walls and our assistant teacher.",
        "Buzz: Ah, that would be the satisfactory.",
        "Olivia: I don't understand this. When we paint ad home, she's very good about staying in the lines.",
        "Buzz: There's nothing wrong with painting outside the lines or the walls. ( Laughs )",
        "Teacher: Emma is a pure delight. She's sweet, unselfish, curious, attentive. I adore her.",
        "Olivia: Well, then why did you give her an \"S\"?",
        "Buzz: Thank you very much. Thank her very much.",
        "Olivia: Thank you very much.",
        "Teacher: Feel free to stay and look at the children's projects if you like.",
        "Buzz: Thank you. You came very close to earning yourself a time out, you lady.",
        "Olivia: I know, I almost blew it, then I'd have no hope of getting a letter of recommendation for Emma later on.",
        "Buzz: Recommendation for what? What, for the \"A\" list at the brownie scouts? You've got to focus on more important things. Focus on this dinner. Speaking of which, speaking of food, how about a quick lunch?",
        "Olivia: You know, I can't. I have to get back to Towers, but thank you so much for being here.",
        "Buzz: Well, my pleasure. Wait, wait, wait, wait.",
        "Olivia: I can't get out.",
        "Buzz: Sit, sit. I'll give you a hand. I'll give-- oops. I think you're on your own, honey. I think I'm going to have to repeat kindergarten. ( Laughing )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Oh, great. Ooh!",
        "Frank: Ooh. Whoa.",
        "Olivia: Frank.",
        "Frank: Olivia.",
        "Olivia: I'm sorry. Busy day, busy night, you know, full tilt boogie.",
        "Frank: Yeah, well you love that, actually.",
        "Olivia: I do, it's how I live.",
        "Frank: Listen, in all of this craziness, have you had an opportunity to see if any flowers came to your place?",
        "Olivia: ( Gasps ) Yes, they were so beautiful. Thank you for thinking of me.",
        "Frank: You know what, I'm always thinking about you. This is a very nice suit on you.",
        "Olivia: Sweetheart, you like it? Thank you.",
        "Josh: Hi, excuse me.",
        "Olivia: Hi.",
        "Josh: Listen. The caterer-- I think she is a little nuts-- she keeps on hounding me, asking me questions I don't know the answers to. And I'm like-- ah!",
        "Olivia: Okay, don't go there. It's okay. I'll take care of it.",
        "Josh: Sorry.",
        "Frank: ( Cell phone rings ) Oh, no, I've got to get this. I'm sorry. I've got to go, so hope to see you soon.",
        "Olivia: Sure. Thanks again for the flowers.",
        "Frank: You're welcome. You're welcome. See you, Josh.",
        "Josh: Frank sent you flowers?",
        "Olivia: Yeah.",
        "Josh: Wow. Oh-- thank you for setting up the breakfast meeting with Martin and Hicks. It worked out very nicely.",
        "Olivia: I'm just looking out for your best interests.",
        "Josh: Well I appreciate that. I'm glad that we can continue to work together and be friends.",
        "Olivia: After everything we've been through, we better be friends. Besides, I think we complement each other pretty well, don't you?",
        "Josh: You get no complaints here. You just keep on doing that thing you do.",
        "Olivia: Oh, you bet I'll keep doing what I keep doing. That's the plan. I had actually given up, but Billy gave me hope again. Another chance at Josh. Even if it just happened to fall in my lap. Okay. \"Good evening, everyone, on behalf of Lewis Construction, I would like to welcome you to the first clients appreciation dinner.\" (Applause) ( Phone rings ) Hello.",
        "Caterer: Hey, we've got a problem.",
        "Olivia: Don't tell me.",
        "Caterer: No, it came on time, but it's smelling a little bit off.",
        "Olivia: Okay, tell the chef to go with the swordfish. Hang on, I have another call coming in. Hello?",
        "Josh: Hi, it's me. I'm just checking in.",
        "Olivia: Everything is fine. We had a little fish issue. But I have a contingency plan. Things will go very smoothly.",
        "Josh: You are very good.",
        "Olivia: I am. See you later. Okay, other than the swordfish, everything else stays the same. I'll see you later. Bye. ( Telephone ringing )",
        "Jane: Hi, it's Jane.",
        "Olivia: Are you in the lobby?",
        "Jane: No, I'm at the hospital, my sister went into labor two weeks early.",
        "Olivia: Fine, you get over here?",
        "Jane: I can't, I'm the birthing coach.",
        "Olivia: This is unacceptable. I'm depending on you.",
        "Jane: She's depending on me. I have to go. I'm sorry.",
        "Olivia: Jane, don't you go. Okay, I've got a plan. Think, think. Plan \"B.\" Thank God you're here. Listen, I know I'm asking a huge favor, but I didn't know who else to call.",
        "Buzz: Calm down.",
        "Olivia: I'm calm. I'm calm. I just have a lot to do and very little time to do it.",
        "Buzz: Come here, come here. Relax. Relax. My God, you've got knots inside your knots. You know, I think I know a way you can really relax.",
        "Olivia: My daughter's on the other side of that door.",
        "Buzz: I meant take a hot bath, you pervert. I mean just sit in the bath and go over your notes.",
        "Olivia: A bath, bath? That's a good idea. I'm not a pervert.",
        "Buzz: Go.",
        "Olivia: You were the right guy to call.",
        "Buzz: You're... ( telephone ringing )",
        "Olivia's voice: Hi, you've reached the Spencers, please leave a message for Olivia or Emma.",
        "Josh: Hi, Olivia, it's Josh, pick up. I don't know if you're on your way to Towers, but I can't figure out what tie to wear tonight, and I was wondering if you-- never mind, I'm a grownup. I can do this. Bye.",
        "Olivia: Was it Josh?",
        "Buzz: It was.",
        "Olivia: I should call him back?",
        "Buzz: No, take your bath. He is having a miner tie crisis. He can handle it; he's a big boy.",
        "Olivia: What if he needs me?",
        "Buzz: What if he needs you? Is that all it takes for you to drop everything for someone? Because if it is... Sorry.",
        "Olivia: No, we're friends.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, yeah. Friends. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Olivia: This could be a real crisis. Not Josh again. Josh.",
        "Josh: Oh, good, hi. I just called your suite a few minutes ago.",
        "Olivia: I know, that's where I am. I was just taking a bath.",
        "Josh: I'm sorry. And now I feel even more lame. I can't decide what tie to wear.",
        "Olivia: Are you wearing your navy pin striped suit with the red shirt?",
        "Josh: Yes, you guessed correctly.",
        "Olivia: Then I'll go with the black tie with the blue squares.",
        "Josh: Okay, okay. Then that's what I'll go with, too. Thank you very much.",
        "Olivia: Listen, this is going to be a great night, I can feel it. Okay, I'll see you soon. I'm going to grab my dress here and I'm going to go finish my bath.",
        "Buzz: You do that.",
        "Olivia: Help.",
        "Buzz: You look great.",
        "Olivia: Thanks. Listen, you really are a lifesaver for helping me out. This dinner has got to be perfect, and if I'm not there to make it happen...",
        "Buzz: You know, even with you planning, things really can't be perfect.",
        "Olivia: What?",
        "Buzz: Well, you keep chasing perfection, it's like chasing your tail.",
        "Olivia: Well, I aim high. I always have. Is that so terrible?",
        "Buzz: No, I didn't say that.",
        "Olivia: In so many words you did. Like reaching for the top is a character defect and settling for second best is not noble.",
        "Buzz: Oh, so then Josh would be the top and the bottom, the second-best, would be--",
        "Olivia: I'm not getting into this with you.",
        "Buzz: That's because you don't want to deviate from the plan. You've got this evening all planned out, right?",
        "Olivia: What is your problem?",
        "Buzz: I keep watching you make the same mistake over and over and over. You keep marrying these rich guys, hoping they can waft you up into some perfect life. But it doesn't happen. Does it? Does it? Because most of the bozos just drive you nuts. One even tried to steal your kid.",
        "Olivia: Josh is nothing like Alan or Phillip. He's practically a different species.",
        "Buzz: Then why weren't you happy when you were married?",
        "Olivia: Because I didn't trust him enough. It was a mistake.",
        "Buzz: So you think you're going to get it right this time, right?",
        "Olivia: Why are you doing this?",
        "Buzz: Because I want you to open your eyes. I want you to open your eyes and see there is no hope for this guy.",
        "Olivia: Listen, I know we have a history and it's a challenge, but I do have my eyes open.",
        "Buzz: You do? I don't think so.",
        "Olivia: Are you going to zip me up or not?",
        "Buzz: Okay, I'll zip you up.",
        "Olivia: Thank you.",
        "Buzz: You're welcome.",
        "Olivia: Yes, I do have a plan: To do what is best for Emma and me. And I know it didn't seem like it, but I know exactly what that is. I know what I'm doing, Buzz, I do. Call me if you need anything.",
        "Buzz: What if I need you?",

        "Coop: Yeah, well, Frank likes Olivia, sure. But I know you're the one who has the connection with her.",
        "Buzz: You don't know what you're talking about.",

        "Frank: No, I just got knocked in the shoulder.",
        "Buzz: What the hell happened?",
        "Frank: We got a call there was a robbery in progress, and I sent some units over there, and when we got over there, the perp took a little girl hostage. By the time I got over there, there was a standoff.",
        "Buzz: And then?",
        "Frank: And then I saw a way to take the guy down, and I went for it. That's how I ended up here. More importantly, the little girl is okay. And that's a tradeoff I can live with. Ah... easy, Pop.",

She is a master planner and we're lucky to have her. ( Applause )",

I don't want to be wasting time anymore. I want to tell her that. I want to tell her that tonight. Don't say anything. You just think I'm nuts, right?",

        "Frank: Ah, you're welcome, but actually dad gave me the bottle of champagne. Maybe we should toast to him.",
        "Olivia: And to the hero.",
        "Frank: Well, it's not like that was the plan, that's for sure. That little girl is about Emma's age, and there is no way in a million years I would ever let a guy hurt a child. You know, Olivia, a lot came into focus for me tonight.",
        "Olivia: I know what you mean.",
        "Frank: You know, up to this point, I've pretty much mapped my whole life out. I guess you could say that I did have a plan. And like this robbery tonight, I never thought in a million years that this guy would take a hostage, let alone a child.",
        "Olivia: It's unsettling when something catches you by surprise.",
        "Frank: Yeah, I certainly didn't expect to jump right in the middle of it, that's for sure.",
        "Olivia: Or get shot.",
        "Frank: You know, I don't regret that. I'm glad I took the risk. Because in one second your life can change forever. Like this. I'm crazy about you.",
        "Olivia: Oh, Frank.",

        "Coop: So I take it you didn't talk to her?",
        "Buzz: Oh, I gave it a shot, but I think Olivia is better off with Frank. They make a nice couple.",
        "Coop: Dad...",
        "Buzz: Just drop it. I'm serious. They want a shot at making each other happy, and they should have it. Okay. To them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Frank, I am a handful. I'm a mess, really.",
        "Frank: I know, and I love you for that. Are you kidding me? You are beautiful and you're great. But you're lonely, just like me. And I want to make you happy. I want to make you so happy. What do you say we give it a shot, huh? Go for it, let's roll with the punches. Come on. Is that so bad?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Come here, baby. Oh, I'm tired, Em. I'm tired of working so hard and waiting for everything to be perfect. I just want to be wanted my someone right now, who's here and who is crazy about me. Frank could be that someone. I mean, he's funny, isn't he? And he is sweet and protective and handsome. And he's Buzz's son. Buzz, the greatest friend in the world. A guy who understands me best.",
