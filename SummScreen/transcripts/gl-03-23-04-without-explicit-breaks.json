        "Reva shares with Jeffrey what she and Josh learned when they went to MC Corp. Despite Jeffrey's warning, she confronts Doris Wolfe. Jeffrey helps Reva find another way to defend her daughter. Cleverly, she demonstrates to Doris and Frank how Carrie victimized her daughter. It looks like a big win for Reva and Jeffrey until Doris produces a bullet in Carrie's cloak that points an incriminating finger at Marah. Lizzie is running lines with Tammy and Joey when she encounters Sam Spencer. He is cold to her, knowing all too well how she has treated his sister, Olivia. But Lizzie works her charm and her negotiating skills on Sam in an effort to win him over. In the attempt, she begins to suspect that Sam is hiding something especially when he goes out of his way to prevent her from knowing where he lives. Lizzie concocts a lie about wanting to get closer to Olivia to persuade Tammy to help her track down Sam's address. Olivia has her hands full with Phillip. Is he merely manic or is he devilishly toying with her? Olivia isn't sure; all she does know is his behavior is as erratic as it was before he was admitted to Ravenwood. Christopher tells her there's a reason: Blood tests reveal that Phillip is off his meds. When Christopher takes Phillip to his office for a therapy session, Olivia finds Phillip's stash of pills under the mattress. Now she has a dilemma: to reveal the stash and make sure Philip gets back on his meds or to let him go on neglecting his medication so that his behavior will keep him at Ravenwood and under her control."

        "Reva: Excuse me. Excuse me, I'm looking for assistant D.A. Dorris wolfe. Oh, yeah, \"the wolf.\" She's probably down in the dungeon with a suspect trying to make him cop a plea. Is there something I can do for you?",
        "Reva: I'm reva lewis. Right, the woman with the tv show.",
        "Reva: Right, lewis daughter marah lewis....",
        "Jeffrey: What are you doing? I heard you were in the building?",
        "Reva: Someone called you?",
        "Jeffrey: Reva, I heard you were demanding to see the assistant D.A..",
        "Reva: I'm not going to make trouble. Or maybe I will if it means opening up the prosecutor's eyes to the facts about marah.",
        "Jeffrey: Facts? Facts that you assume she doesn't have already.",
        "Reva: Marah was manipulated by carrie into shooting her.",
        "Jeffrey: Reva, come on!",
        "Reva: It's her own twisted act of revenge. Why should my daughter be held responsible for a frame-up?",
        "Jeffrey: Framed?",
        "Reva: Yes. Josh and I found a tape?",
        "Jeffrey: Of what?",
        "Reva: Of carrie giving explicit instructions as to how the frame-up was supposed to be handled.",
        "Jeffrey: Where'd you get this tape?",
        "Reva: A place called the M.C. Corporation. It was a phantom company but the tape was left behind.",
        "Jeffrey: And the M.C. Corporation invited you over and gave you to this tape, right?",
        "Reva: Not exactly.",
        "Jeffrey: Reva, do not say another word about this tape, you understand?",
        "Reva: It could show that marah is innocent.",
        "Jeffrey: That's good. Because something else has come up. There's a drug called antimonious, it's an anesthetic. Well, marah's blood tests came in from the night of the shooting and there are indications that there was antimonious in her system.",
        "Reva: Oh, my god. Somebody drugged her?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that's one way of looking at it. But if you were doris wolf prosecuting this case, how would you defend the fact that there were drugs in the system?",
        "Reva: That she was a drug addict, out of control, out to get the person stalking her father.",
        "Jeffrey: And that would be murder, reva, and that's what the state is going to try to prove.",
        "Tammy: Lizzie, I'm not saying that you can't have any fun.",
        "Lizzie: Then, could thou gettest off my back, please?",
        "Joey: I mean, come on. The nurse doing cpr on juliet? I was cracking up.",
        "Tammy: You're such a child.",
        "Lizzie: Please, you were dead, tammy.",
        "Tammy: How can I experience the essence of my character if you two are always goofing off?",
        "Lizzie: The essence?",
        "Joey: Maybe you should experience the essence of having fun.",
        "Tammy: \"Romeo and juliet\" is a tragedy. It's not about having fun. Edmund says that it'S...",
        "Sam: Shakespeare didn't know what works.",
        "Tammy: Sam spencer! Look at you. You've grown up.",
        "Tammy: I heard you were back in town.",
        "Sam: Taking a break from journalism school, hanging out.",
        "Tammy: Sam, this is romeo.",
        "Joey: Joey. How are you doing?",
        "Tammy: And you remember lizzie spaulding?",
        "Tammy: You've changed, too, lizzie, at least that's what folks say.",
        "Lizzie: Well, you can't believe everything you hear.",
        "Sam: If I did, I'd have to believe you went after my pregnant sister and made her fall down a flight of stairs.",
        "Olivia: Hi.",
        "Phillip: Okay, that's one A. Priority under a-1 of the home list. Okay. Exercise. Exercise. Exercise.",
        "Olivia: Phillip?",
        "Phillip: Olivia, did I have you down for a visit? If you can hang on a second, i can check. I don't have my hospital list done yet.",
        "Olivia: What is this?",
        "Phillip: Just stuff I have to do. That's why they call them to-do notes.",
        "Olivia: You have been busy.",
        "Phillip: I have a plan. Plans require direction and execution. The sooner I get out of here, the sooner I can make a home for you and emma. And I have that one up there.",
        "Olivia: I don't want you to write about it either, okay?",
        "Phillip: Okay. Well, let me make a note of that.",
        "Olivia: We have to be together on this, please.",
        "Phillip: Well, we are. We are.",
        "Olivia: No, we're not. We have to keep her a secret, phillip. Please. Phillip, you're hurting me. Let go, sweetheart.",
        "Phillip: I don't want to.",
        "Olivia: You're hurting me. You don't want to hurt me, do you?",
        "Phillip: Your're my wife. No, you're the mother of my child.",
        "Olivia: Yes.",
        "Phillip: Why would I want to hurt you?",
        "Olivia: You're certainly regaining your strength. I don't think you realize how much.",
        "Phillip: I was weak. But now I feel strong.",
        "Olivia: It's good you want to accomplish so much phillip, you know, in your life, at spaulding.",
        "Phillip: Yeah, I've been cataloging all the subsidiaries with the department heads and their responsibilities. I used to know, but....",
        "Olivia: You will again soon. You're just going to have to pace yourself.",
        "Phillip: Well, there's no time. See, I have to show the doctors I can get out so I can make a home for you and... don't worry, I won't say it. I did it. This is... this is really hard. Hey, how about... how about if I'm thinking about her and we're in the same room together, can i just tug on my ear like this?",
        "Olivia: No, no! Listen to me. No signals, no hand shakes! No mention of her in any way, shape, or form. We have to leave things the way they are right now.",
        "Phillip: Why are you getting so angry. We both love our daughter only you get to show it and I don't?",
        "Olivia: I know this isn't fair. I know it isn'T. It's just that you... you want to get better and see her then you need to take your meds. You need to keep up with your meds, right.",
        "Phillip: You already said how strong I'm getting. Look at this. Watch. I've been doing push ups.",
        "Olivia: Phillip, stop it! Just stop it!",
        "Phillip: Hey, I can do these all day!",
        "Olivia: I know you could. I don't want you to push yourself.",
        "Phillip: Why? I want to get out of here. Isn't that what you want?",
        "Lizzie: So you heard your sister and I didn't get along?",
        "Sam: Is that supposed to qualify as an understatement. I heard you want to kill her.",
        "Joey: You know, I could use help running lines.",
        "Tammy: Let's go sit over there. See you around, sam.",
        "Sam: Yeah.",
        "Lizzie: Afraid to be alone with me?",
        "Sam: I don't see any staircases around.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, well, olivia hated me and so I hated her.",
        "Sam: I heard it was the other way around.",
        "Lizzie: Well, that kind of depends on how who you ask but i don't blame you on crossing the street every time you see me.",
        "Sam: Good idea.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, and just so you know what your sister's probably telling you about me is 100% true. I did want her dead for what i thought she was doing to my family.",
        "Sam: All that therapy must be paying off. Your honesty is refreshing.",
        "Lizzie: No, I've just done a lot of bad things to a lot of people. You can ask tammy and joey. At least I've still got friends who believe in me. And you know what? You're right. Coming clean about everything I've done to people is a major part of my therapy.",
        "Sam: Good for you and good for your friends, if they'll have you. Just don't count me among them, okay?",
        "Lizzie: I'm not looking for any friend. I'm looking to make things right with the people that I've hurt. I'm trying to make things up with your sister, but I'm not getting very far.",
        "Sam: Maybe that's because she I don't know, thinks you're a sociopath.",
        "Lizzie: I'm not going to stop trying.",
        "Sam: A persistent sociopath, I believe that's called a stalker.",
        "Lizzie: You're not going to cut me a break, are you?",
        "Sam: No.",
        "Lizzie: Has your life been so perfect, sam? You've never made mistakes? You've never been young and stupid and did something you know you shouldn't, but just couldn't help yourself?",
        "Sam: You've got five minutes.",
        "Rick: So, you all ready for the big fund-raiser?",
        "Bill: It's going to happen. Just like you and mel having that baby. Too late now to change your mind.",
        "Rick: I like that line, bill. I'll use it on my wife in the delivery room. She'll really love that, won't she?",
        "Bill: I'm sure she will. A way to guarantee no more kids. So what's going on with you? Just about baby time?",
        "Rick: I'm just waiting for the beeper to beep.",
        "Bill: Boy or girl?",
        "Rick: We'll find out in the delivery room. Doesn't matter.",
        "Bill: That's the way I'd do it. One of life's great surprises.",
        "Rick: It does matter. Can you keep a secret? We're hoping for a little girl.",
        "Bill: Looks just like her momma.",
        "Rick: Exactly. Well let's hope so.",
        "Bill: How about names? I'm sure you've put a lot of thought to that.",
        "Rick: I have. So has everyone else in the family. Well you know what? It doesn't matter. We'll know her when we meet her or him.",
        "Bill: You love it, don't you? I mean, the marriage and the kids and....",
        "Rick: This is a sensitive moment we're having right now, isn't it?",
        "Bill: Never mind!",
        "Rick: Embrace it. I love being a father. I love being a dad. I like being a big brother, too. Have you seen my sister?",
        "Bill: I haven't seen her in a while.",
        "Rick: Bill, doesn't it seem to you that she's happier than she's been in a long time? I mean....",
        "Bill: Yeah, that's true. It's a good thing, too, because now she can help get her husband elected.",
        "Rick: I know. You know I really want that more for her than I do for him.",
        "Bill: Well, they really love one another.",
        "Rick: That's what it's all about.",
        "Doris wolfe: Frank, would you let me do any job?",
        "Frank: You've already done your job. I've covered the physical evidence.",
        "Doris wolfe: Well, I'm going through it again.",
        "Frank: I didn't miss a thing.",
        "Doris wolfe: Maybe, maybe not you know the D.A. Who recused himself for personal reasons? Look, as far as I'm concerned, jeffrey o'neill is one more person in this town intent on protecting poor little marah lewis.",
        "Frank: Is that basically all you have against this guy?",
        "Doris wolfe: Look, he blows into town from mount olympus and I'm shown the door? The hotter they are, the faster they burn. He compromised himself. He lost site of his professionalism and....",
        "Frank: What?",
        "Doris wolfe: You missed something, frank. Something that proves marah lewis is guilty.",
        "Reva: Building a case around marah being a drug addict, that doesn't make sense.",
        "Jeffrey: Doris wolfe is going to spin this any way she can. First thing you need to do is calm down. Why don't you visit ross marler see what kind of case he's building in marah's defense and show him that tape that I don't know anything about.",
        "Reva: I don't think I can stand around here not doing anything to help her.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm afraid that's what you're going to have to do.",
        "Doris wolfe: There's a cozy picture, the D.A. With mrs. Lewis, mother of the accused.",
        "Jeffrey: Reva was just leaving.",
        "Reva: Looking for a fight doris?",
        "Doris wolfe: I don't believe I have any business with you at this time.",
        "Reva: Why did you come running over here the minute you saw jeffrey and me talking.",
        "Doris wolfe: Jeffrey has more than casual feelings for your daughter.",
        "Reva: Feelings? You don't know what feelings are because you don't have any, or smarts, for that matter. This case is absurd.",
        "Doris wolfe: Take jeffrey's advice and leave, mrs. Lewis.",
        "Reva: I'm sorry, did that hurt? Get used to it. Do you think you have the guts to go after my daughter? Good luck.",
        "Olivia: How can you think that I don't want you out of this place, huh? Here, sit. Why do you think I'm doing everything that I'm doing? Why do you think I wanted to marry you?",
        "Phillip: Those are a lot of questions.",
        "Olivia: There's an answer. I want us to make a family together, you know, you, me, and emma. We owe it to her, you know and we can do this.",
        "Phillip: If I don't screw it up.",
        "Olivia: You won't screw it up all right? Unless you insist on speaking about her or signals and hand shakes, okay? This isn't a game.",
        "Phillip: Oh, I know.",
        "Olivia: We have to handle this ourselves, all right? We have to control what people know and when they know it.",
        "Phillip: You know, it's just so hard.",
        "Olivia: I know.",
        "Phillip: Because I want....",
        "Olivia: I know. You want to be a proud daddy and show everyone your little girl.",
        "Phillip: Yes.",
        "Olivia: You will. I promise. You just have to be 100%, right? And you have to do whatever dr. Langham asks you to.",
        "Christopher: My sentiment exactly.",
        "Phillip: Hey, doc! I'm feeling spunky today. Look at all the progress I'm making.",
        "Christopher: So I see. Progress toward what, phillip?",
        "Phillip: The organization of my thoughts. Making my mind and my body work together. Isn't that what we've been talking about?",
        "Christopher: Yes.",
        "Phillip: Let me tell you, before my confusion, I used to run five miles a day and take 20 calls before lunch. Now look, I'M... I'm back. I'm back on track. I did pushups today. You want to see me doctor them?",
        "Olivia: Don't show off. I'm sure the doctor has a lot of work he has to do.",
        "Phillip: Oh, that reminds me. This could actually take a while. Do you mind?",
        "Christopher: No. Not at all. We'll step outside.",
        "Phillip: Yeah, it could take a while. But I am back on track, olivia, and I promise you, you are going to get what you have coming to you.",
        "Olivia: Sticking notes on the wall, each one has something scrawled on it. It's like he lost his mind all over again.",
        "Christopher: Let's not over- dramatize the situation.",
        "Olivia: Is that possible? He was deeply sad before but now he looks like a first rate nut case.",
        "Christopher: Olivia!",
        "Olivia: What are you people doing? I thought his medication was supposed to level him off?",
        "Christopher: That's my concern, actually. I received new blood work. There was only a trace of medication in phillip's system.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. Five minutes.",
        "Sam: Start the clock.",
        "Lizzie: Go. Okay. I blame my family for a lot.",
        "Sam: Not too original, but it works for most kids your age.",
        "Lizzie: And I blamed your sister for shacking up with my grandfather then doing my dad behind grandpa's back. And I hated her for it.",
        "Sam: You're entitled to your feelings. I heard you burned down your dormitory at boarding school.",
        "Lizzie: That has nothing....",
        "Sam: Whatever. You already practically admitted to shoving a pregnant lady down the stairs.",
        "Lizzie: There was no shoving involved and I warned her.",
        "Sam: Olivia told me you warned her. A momentary case of guilt.",
        "Lizzie: Being a monster isn't as easy as it looks.",
        "Sam: And now?",
        "Lizzie: And now I'm apologizing for things I've done.",
        "Sam: You drove my sister out of town.",
        "Lizzie: I know. And I know I'm probably the one responsible for her losing her baby.",
        "Sam: Wow. Well, that's more than i expected from you.",
        "Lizzie: Well, I told you i was apologizing for everything.",
        "Sam: What do you want, lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: I want to sit down with olivia and just tell her the way that I feel. Just say \"I'm sorry.\" She can hate me all she wants, but she doesn't have to be afraid of me. We both love my dad, sam. Why can't we just meet someplace safe and work things out from there?",
        "Sam: Maybe you can.",
        "Lizzie: We can meet at your place and you could even be there if you want.",
        "Sam: Wait, you want to make up with olivia at my place?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. I figure it would be someplace where she'd be comfortable and we can both open up and then there'd be nothing left to hide.",
        "Bill: Great to see you and michelle so happy, you know? She and danny, you and mel and you both deserve it. You.",
        "Rick: I appreciate that. You've just got to stop and appreciate moments like this when everybody in the family is doing okay and everybody's healthy. I never take it for granted.",
        "Bill: As happy as I am with my life right now, it's like I'm worried about marah.",
        "Rick: Marah's going to be okay. She is. Ross is an excellent attorney and he's going to clear marah's name.",
        "Bill: You're right. He is a great attorney and he should remain an attorney and let my guy run the city.",
        "Rick: Time will tell, won't it? I actually have to go. I'm going to ravenwood to see phillip.",
        "Bill: How is phillip? I mean, kind of weird, married to olivia at the hospital?",
        "Rick: That's a marriage i don't want to talk about.",
        "Bill: Understand. Understand. Good luck. I'll talk to you later.",
        "Edmund: Bye. Hi, bill. Campaigning going well?",
        "Bill: I'm sorry. What?",
        "Edmund: Campaign going well?",
        "Bill: Yeah, sorry. Rick and I were just talking about marriage, kids you know?",
        "Edmund: Well, unfortunately i wouldn't have much to contribute there.",
        "Bill: What were you saying about the campaign?",
        "Edmund: Huh? Oh, cassie. Cassie is behind herself trying to make this party a success.",
        "Bill: Cassie has been amazing.",
        "Edmund: No argument there.",
        "Bill: She's been a friend of danny's from the beginning.",
        "Edmund: Good. Good. I hope danny appreciates that because I know how easy it is for people in his position to often take others for granted.",
        "Bill: Well, as long as you don't take cassie for granted.",
        "Edmund: She makes that quite impossible. Bill?",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Edmund: She's been working so hard for danny and at the same time she is worried sick about marah.",
        "Bill: Yeah. Aren't we all.",
        "Jeffrey: Reva, this is not the time.",
        "Reva: I'm not going anywhere until ms. Wolf is made aware of some facts.",
        "Frank: Reva, for your own protection, I suggest that whatever you say should come through ross.",
        "Reva: Why do I need a lawyer for a mouthpiece when she can stand in front of cameras, the press, \"good morning springfield.\" It's my daughter that's the victim.",
        "Doris wolfe: You're welcome to go to the press any time you like, mrs. Lewis, but I wouldn't recommend it. Jeffrey, we need you in the room.",
        "Reva: I know. I should haven't shot off my mouth. It's just that woman....",
        "Jeffrey: You know what? Doris is right.",
        "Reva: She is?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. You should go to the press.",
        "Reva: And shoot off my mouth to them the way I did with her?",
        "Jeffrey: That tape that you and josh found? Doris is going to use every trick in the book to suppress it. It will never see the light of day.",
        "Reva: Terrific.",
        "Jeffrey: It will never see the light of day in front of a judge. But there's the court of public opinion. And I think it's time that you made a statement.",
        "Reva: You want me to make a statement. What? To the press, doris? The cops? Who?",
        "Jeffrey: Listen, for reasons that have to do with words like \"collusion\" and \"conflict of interest,\" let's just imagine that I'm just a guy with a law degree right now, okay? And I'm just going to give some tactical advice to a friend.",
        "Reva: I'm listening.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Let's say that you came across some evidence that corroborates a certain theory.",
        "Reva: A theory that marah is innocent?",
        "Jeffrey: Yes. And let's say you came across some corporate offices that belonged to a certain company?",
        "Reva: M.C. Corps?",
        "Jeffrey: That's a good name. And the evidence is of a conspiracy to frame someone for murder and this evidence happens to be a tape recording of ms. Carruthers herself and you would like to produce this evidence in defense of your daughter. Now, if the assistant district attorney should choose to ignore this evidence or somehow suppress it, I'm sure that the press would love to hear your statement.",
        "Reva: You're a good lawyer.",
        "Jeffrey: That's why I'm not trying this case.",
        "Frank: Hey, o'neill, I need to talk to you for a minute.",
        "Jeffrey: Be right there. Start writing.",
        "Doris wolfe: Are you done out there, jeffrey?",
        "Jeffrey: What is that? You really want to go ten rounds with me?",
        "Doris wolfe: I'm not sure yet.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, let me clear it up for you, okay? You work for me. I'm your boss. Okay, you're on this case because I assigned you to it and I can take you off of it.",
        "Doris wolfe: You're biting my head off for being objective? You knew a case involving marah lewis would be hard for you to try which is why you assigned me.",
        "Jeffrey: Don't flatter yourself. This case would be a cakewalk for me and you know it.",
        "Doris wolfe: Which is why you assigned me. You don't want marah lewis to be prosecuted at all.",
        "Jeffrey: What I want, doris, is justice, okay? You've got all the paperwork. You've got all the physical evidence which speaks for itself. I'm sure you're going to come to the same conclusion that I came to.",
        "Doris wolfe: Well, I wouldn't bet on that.",
        "Reva: Excuse me.",
        "Doris wolfe: Mrs. Louis, I'm going to have you removed from the building.",
        "Reva: Even if I wanted to present a statement? Some evidence has come to light that you might want to know about. You or the press. Take your pick.",
        "Bill: You know, I think part of the reason why cassie's been so busy on danny's campaign is she knows she can help. Not much we can do for marah right now and I think it's driving us all real crazy.",
        "Edmund: Yeah. I can imagine. Marah's such a wonderful girl. The thought of her in prison is just....",
        "Bill: Well, we don't think about that.",
        "Edmund: Yeah. You know, it's a shame our D.A. Hasn't been able to do anything to help.",
        "Bill: You mean o'neill? That's a weird guy right there. I tell you what's weird. The resemblance....",
        "Edmund: I try not to think about that.",
        "Bill: I will admit, I do appreciate the fact that he's supported danny from the beginning. Let me just get him to stay away from my cousin everything will be great. We'll make sure he doesn't do any more damage.",
        "Edmund: Bill, watching your family work together in a crisis has been an education. It's the first time I have ever been a part of anything like this.",
        "Bill: Yeah. Well, we do stick together, that's true. But from what I understand, you sure have done your part. Yeah. Cassie tells me you've been a great help with tammy, coaching for her the school play. Stuff like that does help.",
        "Edmund: Tammy's a wonderful girl. I enjoyed working with her.",
        "Bill: That's a good thing. Because I don't think any of us know too much about shakespeare. Anyway, cassie really does appreciate it.",
        "Edmund: Good. Tammy's done a terrific job. I'm proud of her. I'm proud to be a part of this big event in her life.",
        "Joey: Can't take your eye office the guy. What's up with that?",
        "Tammy: Nothing.",
        "Joey: Really?",
        "Tammy: Jealous?",
        "Joey: No.",
        "Tammy: So? You are so.",
        "Joey: So.",
        "Tammy: Oh, you are.",
        "Joey: Whatever! The guy's old enough to be your babysitter.",
        "Tammy: What's wrong with someone older.",
        "Joey: Try bringing him home to your mom instead of me. See how far you get.",
        "Sam: You know, I'm all for this making up with olivia thing you've got going on, but my place is not the place to do it.",
        "Lizzie: Why?",
        "Sam: I'm a guy, it's a dump, I'm busy, I've got roaches. Use the beacon.",
        "Lizzie: That won't work. You remember me, her, big flight of stairs?",
        "Sam: Use spaulding, you guys got enough rooms.",
        "Lizzie: That's hostile territory. Your place would be perfect.",
        "Sam: No.",
        "Lizzie: Sam....",
        "Sam: I said no.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. Fine, I'm backing off. But you know what?",
        "Sam: What?",
        "Lizzie: Take it from someone who's used to hiding things from people, you are acting like it.",
        "Sam: Like? What?",
        "Lizzie: Like you're hiding something.",
        "Olivia: How can there only be trace amounts of medication in his blood system?",
        "Christopher: That's something we have to figure out.",
        "Olivia: He's given his pills everyday. I've watched him take his medication myself.",
        "Christopher: Maybe you only saw what he wanted you to see.",
        "Olivia: And so what are you saying? He's stashing his meds?",
        "Christopher: Seems likely.",
        "Olivia: I... okay. If he's not taking his medication, if he's not swallowing it, what do we do?",
        "Christopher: I could administer it hypodermically.",
        "Olivia: He's going to think you're treating him like a child.",
        "Christopher: Phillip does have control issues.",
        "Olivia: No kidding. Why don't woe we wait a couple days. Give him a couple days to see how important his meds are.",
        "Christopher: No. I'm afraid that will set his progress back by months. Phillip, can you take a minute and join me in my office?",
        "Phillip: Can I talk you into letting me out of this place?",
        "Christopher: You can try.",
        "Phillip: Okay. I'm your man. Are you staying?",
        "Olivia: Oh, yeah. I will.",
        "Phillip: Okey-dokey. I'll see you.",
        "Olivia: Oh, what are you doing? Wow! Well, you may have just made this a whole lot easier for me.",
        "Olivia: Hi.",
        "Rick: Where's phillip?",
        "Olivia: In session with dr. Langham.",
        "Rick: This isn't his normal session time, is it?",
        "Olivia: Look around, rick. Do you see anything normal?",
        "Rick: So when did this happen?",
        "Olivia: Last night, today. Have you noticed a change in his behavior? You know, like it's become more exaggerated?",
        "Rick: Well, this certainly would qualify, wouldn't it?",
        "Olivia: Yeah. Christopher seems to think that he's not taking his medication, he's not swallowing it. What would happen if he wasn't on his prescribed drugs?",
        "Rick: Well, he would ultimately go into relapse and behave like he did when he first got here.",
        "Olivia: But it wouldn't cause any permanent damage?",
        "Rick: Well, it wouldn't kill him, but without his medication, there's just no telling how long he would be here. And we just can't allow that to happen, can we olivia? We just can't allow him to get stuck in this hell hole. I'm sorry, did I just say \"we?\" I meant, \"I won't let it happen.\" It has occurred to me that you're perfectly fine with phillip justhere he is.",
        "Olivia: How can you say that to me?",
        "Rick: Don't act offended. This is what you want for him.",
        "Olivia: You're wrong. I'm his wife. How can you say that?",
        "Rick: Because I'm catching on to you.",
        "Sam: You know what's annoying about you, lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: I'm sure you're going to tell me.",
        "Sam: You don't take hints. What could I possibly be hiding?",
        "Lizzie: I really don't know. All I know, you started getting weird, that's all.",
        "Sam: That wasn't me getting weird. That was me having things to do before tolerating you for the five minutes that you asked for and then still having more things to do while I spend another five minutes talking to you. And now you want me to help you make up with olivia by giving you my apartment key?",
        "Lizzie: Tolerate. Wow, that is really nice of you, sam.",
        "Sam: You want to figure things out with my sister? Do it on your own time. Don't use me. And don't scam me into seeing my apartment to satisfy your curiosities about me.",
        "Lizzie: I'm not curious about you!",
        "Sam: You could have met olivia anywhere. Why does it have to be at my place? I'm flatter but what are you, like, 12?",
        "Lizzie: Shut up. I'm not hitting on you. I'm not!",
        "Sam: Look, I'd help you out but my place is a mess. I've got a lot of writing to do.",
        "Lizzie: I thought you said you were taking time off from school.",
        "Lizzie: I am. I'm freelancing with the west coast peper. Which, by the way, I have a deadline to meet, so best case, I'll tell live you and I spoke.",
        "Lizzie: Thanks.",
        "Sam: See you around.",
        "Tammy: Sam didn't say good- bye?",
        "Lizzie: I guess he had somewhere to go. Someplace important.",
        "Doris wolfe: Thank you, mrs. Lewis, but there's nothing new here.",
        "Reva: Really? Huh. That's too bad, because I happen to be in possession of a tape of caroline carruthers giving explicit instructions as to how she's going to frame someone. That someone could be josh or marah or any of the others. She didn't really care.",
        "Doris wolfe: Even if you did have a recording in your possession-- and I won't ask how it really came into your possession-- it would have to be verified and it would have to be relevant.",
        "Reva: Well, if you're not interested in my tape or the circumstances surrounding it, then maybe the press will be. Or I could do a segment on the \"reva lewis show.\" How evidence sometimes doesn't get shown to a jury. That ought to make my ratings soar.",
        "Doris wolfe: Have you heard this tape?",
        "Jeffrey: No.",
        "Doris wolfe: Even if carruthers is on that tape, i have more compelling evidence than a voice from a grave. A bullet hole.",
        "Jeffrey: So?",
        "Doris wolfe: A bullet hole in the back of the cape. Now, if marah lewis was acting in self-defense, tell me, why did she shoot the woman in the back?",
        "Reva: Come on, jeffrey. Hey.",
        "Jeffrey: Hi.",
        "Reva: What took you so long. I was worried.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah.",
        "Reva: Why do you look like that? You said I did a good job. Why do you have that look on your face?",
        "Jeffrey: The cape that carrie was wearing the night of the shooting, it came back from the lab and showed that the bullet entered from the back.",
        "Reva: She was shot in the back?",
        "Jeffrey: Doris is going to convene a grand jury, reva. She's going to charge marah with murder one.",
        "Edmund: Wow. Bill, if you'll excuse me, I've got some things to do.",
        "Bill: Me, too. Cassie's got everything under control here. Everything seems to be running smoothly so....",
        "Edmund: Good. Well, sometimes I think things just have a way of falling into place. At least that's what I've been told.",
        "Bill: Hope you're right, edmund. Hope you're right.",
        "Tammy: Okay. Don't forget we have a character development session tomorrow. Edmund wants us to be on time.",
        "Joey: Right. Wouldn't want to keep the master waiting.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. I need your help. It's about sam.",
        "Tammy: What do you need and why would I help you?",
        "Lizzie: Why wouldn't you help me?",
        "Tammy: Because you've burned me in the past and it's about sam. He's out of your league.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, right. And he's in yours?",
        "Tammy: What do you want, lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: It's about olivia, actually.",
        "Tammy: President of your fan club.",
        "Lizzie: I just want sam to help me make up with olivia.",
        "Tammy: And you need me for....",
        "Lizzie: Oh, well, I got olivia this wedding gift and sam told me to bring it by the beacon but what I wanted to do was bring it by his place.",
        "Tammy: Why?",
        "Lizzie: Well, because then he'll know that I'm sincere and that I can just hand deliver it to his sister.",
        "Tammy: Not your best idea.",
        "Lizzie: Why?",
        "Tammy: Last time I checked, olivia still hated you, or you freak her out or both.",
        "Lizzie: Well, tammy, at least I'm trying. I'm sick and tired of people turning their face on me when I'm just trying to say I'm sorry. I don't care if they slam the door in my face. At least they know I'm trying to be sincere.",
        "Tammy: So what do you want from me?",
        "Lizzie: Sam's address.",
        "Tammy: Why would I have it?",
        "Lizzie: Well, I figured olivia may have in the a file at the beacon.",
        "Tammy: You know what I any you're just trying to get closer to sam.",
        "Lizzie: No, actually. I'm trying to get closer to this normal life people say I'm going to have any day now. And I need your help. Please. I'm not trying to get closer to sam. I'm actually trying to get closer to olivia.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, I know what you think of me, rick.",
        "Rick: I don't trust you.",
        "Olivia: Because you love phillip and you think I just married him for money and power, right? But you know that I was in love with him long before this happened.",
        "Rick: The problem with that past is fill's father was also in love we w you. You were alan's wife.",
        "Olivia: I tricked him into having this affair?",
        "Rick: Phillip and alan have moved on which left you out, didn't it olivia. Then you managed to get him to marry you in this loony bin which put yourself back into the game. Funny how things work out.",
        "Olivia: I care about my husband.",
        "Rick: I care about my dog. So what? What does that have to do with true love?",
        "Olivia: It's not that easy for some of us, rick. You know what phillip and i meant to each other. You think I was going to give that up without a fight? I don't want to have of the to fight his best friend. We want the same thing. We want him out of here and we want a whole man again.",
        "Rick: Well, you're right about that. So I trust that you will do whatever possible to help him in that process.",
        "Phillip: Hey!",
        "Rick: Hey!",
        "Phillip: Ranger rick. He always used to hate it when i call him that. I'm doing great. I did push-ups today, getting back in shape. I did five.",
        "Rick: Great.",
        "Phillip: I can do five. At least, around there's my brain. I'm almost as strong. I was telling christopher I've got tons of ideas about how to improve this place.",
        "Rick: That's great. Why don't we go outside and talk about it.",
        "Phillip: Christopher, you should come. You, too, olivia.",
        "Olivia: I will. I'll be right behind you.",
        "Phillip: All right. Olivia?",
        "Olivia: Yeah.",
        "Phillip: You coming?",
        "Olivia: Be right there. I love you.",

        "Marah: The grand jury needs to hear the truth and not just doris wolfe's side of the story.",
