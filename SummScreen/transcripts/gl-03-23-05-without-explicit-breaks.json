        "Edmund: Reva, I need your help. Cassie left town. She took off last night \r\nwith rj and she wouldn't tell me where she was going. She was upset. Do you have \r\nany idea where she is? ",
        "Reva: You said cassie left? Does that mean she didn't finish the rest of her \r\nivf procedure? ",
        "Edmund: No, she didn'T. ",
        "Reva: Am I supposed to be sad about that? ",
        "Dinah: ( Laughing ) I've been waiting to tell you. ",
        "Jonathan: No, don't stop. Keep talking. Pretend I'm edmund and tell me what's \r\non your mind. ",
        "Lizzie: Whenever you're done cleaning this table make sure you go clean the \r\ntraps. I need you to clean the oven. And I would appreciate the front porch. ",
        "Coop: Done yet? ",
        "Lizzie: I don't know. Have you listened to anything I've said? ",
        "Coop: Well, I saw a mouth move and a lot of words came out of it. But, \r\nbasically, what I've heard was, \"oh, my god, coop, I'm so ticked at you because \r\nyou made my loser boyfriend leave and now I'm going to get you back.\" ",
        "Lizzie: Okay, tyler scofield is not a loser. And if there's a loser in this \r\nroom, I'm looking at him. ",
        "Coop: Whatever, lizard. ",
        "Lizzie: What?! What did you just call me? ",
        "Alexandra: Careful, darling. Lizzie, come on, you wouldn't want anyone to see \r\nyou feeling now, would you? ( Lizzie clears throat ) ",
        "Beth: Rick. ",
        "Rick: Hey. ",
        "Beth: Hey. ",
        "Rick: Hey, beth. You look great. ",
        "Beth: Oh, thank you. ",
        "Rick: How have you been? I haven't seen much of you lately? What's going on?\r\n",
        "Beth: Yeah, um... well, you know, I thought it was best for us to keep our \r\ndistance.Stance. ",
        "Rick: Yeah, you're probably right. ",
        "Beth: So is it true what they say about this witness? That he could clear \r\nharley? ",
        "Rick: Yeah. I mean that's what I'm hearing. ",
        "Alan: Well, o'neill, I trust the information I got you will prove to be \r\nhelpful. ",
        "Jeffrey: Well, yes, if it's for real. ",
        "Alan: 100% legit, counselor. ",
        "Jeffrey: Well, we'd all feel a lot more confident if we knew who your source \r\nwas, alan. ",
        "Alan: They wish to remain anonymous. But she's a spaulding employee that just \r\nhappened to be at the right place at the right time. Should be an interesting \r\nsession. ",
        "Jeffrey: Hi, olivia. ",
        "Olivia: Hello, jeffrey. ",
        "Jeffrey: I need a word with you. ",
        "Olivia: Is it about my testimony? ",
        "Jeffrey: Well, alan just brought a certain item to my attention. I think you \r\nmight know something about it. ",
        "Olivia: No. ",
        "Jeffrey: Certain visual item. ",
        "Olivia: I really don't know what you're talking about. ",
        "Jeffrey: Right. ",
        "Olivia: What? ",
        "Bill: Come here. You better have a damn good explanation for what you did.\r\n",
        "Harley: You look nervous. ",
        "Gus: Nah. Focused. The other guy, he should be nervous. ",
        "Harley: Do you think you'll call me to the stand? ",
        "Gus: So o'neill can take a crack at you? Not a chance in hell. No, webster's \r\ntestimony is going to be enough to blow states case out of the water. Just don't \r\nworry about it. The jury will not be able to find you guilty. ",
        "Olivia: Stop it. I was over a barrel, okay. I had to think about emma. ",
        "Bill: What are you talking about? Since when does selling half of lewis \r\nbuilding to alan spaulding have anything to do with emma? ",
        "Olivia: The building. You're talking about the building? ",
        "Bill: Yes, I'm talking about the building. I found out. Were you ever going \r\nto tell me? ",
        "Olivia: Yes, I was going to tell you. ",
        "Bill: Really? Are you so desperate to buy alan's favor that you would sell \r\nout your husband? Is that what's going on? ",
        "Olivia: I can explain. I can explain everything. ",
        "Bill: Please do. ",
        "Olivia: I have to testify soon. I'm nervous. I can't do it now. Listen to me. \r\nI should have told you. I'm sorry. And alan is not using me. It's the other way \r\naround. Trust me. ",
        "Alan: Famous last words. Good luck with your testimony today, olivia. It \r\nshould be enlightening. ",
        "Bill: What's that about? ",
        "Olivia: Alan being alan. ",
        "Bill: Okay. ",
        "Olivia: Everything is going to be fine. Don't worry. ",
        "Harley: Will you call webster first? ",
        "Gus: No. I'm doing bat cleanup. I've got to put some more dents in his case \r\nfirst. ",
        "Harley: What kind of dents? ",
        "Gus: I'll just show the court how half this town had motive and opportunity \r\nfor wanting to shoot phillip. ",
        "Harley: I'm not going to like this part am I? ",
        "Gus: It has to be done. ",
        "Bailiff: All rise. ",
        "Judge: Be seated. Court is in session. Mr. Aitoro, are you ready to continue \r\npresenting your case? ",
        "Gus: Yes, judge. Yes. The defense would like to call dr. Rick bauer. ",
        "Alexandra: Lizzie. Lizzie, that boy gets to you doesn't he? ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, you better believe he does. He gets on my last nerve. I keep \r\ntrying to push him away and he doesn't understand. I even tried bringing another \r\nguy in her to let him know I'm dating other guys. ",
        "Alexandra: Or to make him jealous, huh? ",
        "Lizzie: No, I really do like the guy. ",
        "Alexandra: Hmm. Mm-hmm. ",
        "Lizzie: I don't know what coop said. He must have said something really mean, \r\nbecause he left. You're late. ",
        "Waitress: I'm so sorry, lizzie. I had to stop and get this for coop. ",
        "Lizzie: For coop? What are you getting coop a gift for? To thank him. He \r\nrescued me the other day. Your friend tyler was totally macking on me and coop \r\nscared him away. I totally owe him. ",
        "Alexandra: Oh, that's sounds totally like coop, doesn't it? Such a nasty \r\nperson. ",
        "Edmund: I just want to find cassie and bring her home. I would imagine you \r\nwould too considering your the reason she ran off. ",
        "Reva: Oh, you know what? You are living in a fantasy world. She ran off \r\nbecause of you, edmund. You attacked jeffrey. You started the fire that nearly--\r\n",
        "Edmund: And now she's god knows where upset and alone. Does that make you \r\nhappy? ",
        "Reva: None of this makes me happy. This is all very sad. ",
        "Edmund: Reva, I just want to make things right with her. ",
        "Reva: What exactly is your definition of right? ",
        "Edmund: I just want to find her and make sure she's safe. ",
        "Reva: So you can lock her in the tower again? Cut her off from the rest of \r\nthe outside world? ",
        "Edmund: I want to give her all the time in the world to think. Because I \r\nbelieve if she takes that time, she's going to remember how much she loves me.\r\n",
        "Reva: Or someone will remind her of the kind of man you really are. ",
        "Edmund: Oh, god. Don't you think you've done enough damage already, reva? \r\nLook, all right, all right. Please. I'm sorry. Please. If you hear from her, \r\nplease just don't say anything to scare her off any further. Please. Can you \r\npromise that at least? ",
        "Reva: You know what? If you can swear to me that you won't go after her or \r\nmake her come back before she's ready to come back on her own. ",
        "Edmund: I swear. I swear. Besides, in a few more days i think she may have \r\nmore reason to listen to me. ",
        "Reva: A few more days. Why? What's going on? ",
        "Edmund: A lot. I hope. ",
        "Dinah: This really is not a good time. ",
        "Jonathan: Well, I want to hear all about the big news you have for uncle \r\nedmund. ( Cell phone rings ) mommy dearest. She can wait. ",
        "Dinah: No, I really think you should take that. Take it in the hall. ",
        "Jonathan: No, I really tlink you should tell me what you have cooking with \r\nthe e-man. Where's cassie? ",
        "Dinah: She's out of town. ",
        "Jonathan: Really? I bet you were there to help edmund pick up the pieces. ",
        "Dinah: You can say that. ",
        "Jonathan: Well, good for you. I hope that this doesn't mean that you're an \r\none man woman now. ",
        "Dinah: Stop, stop. I'm not in the mood. ",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) since when? If you're nervous about edmund showing up, \r\nyou can relax. I'm very good at sneaking out of hotel rooms. Why don't you have \r\na little drink of this? It'll help you relax. ",
        "Dinah: Get that away from me. ",
        "Gus: Dr. Bauer, how did it feel to have your best friend in the world kidnap \r\nyour son, jude? ",
        "Rick: How did it feel? ",
        "Gus: Betrayed? Make you furious? Mad? Sacred for your son's life? ",
        "Rick: Sure. All the above. ",
        "Gus: When a father is in that frantic state of mind, it's possible for him to \r\nturn to violence isn't it? ",
        "Rick: I guess you could say that. ",
        "Gus: Well, I would say that because you turned violence, right? The day \r\nbefore his murder you attacked him on a basketball court. You took a needle, you \r\ntried to inject him with a sedative. Isn't that right? ",
        "Rick: I did it for his own good. He needed to be in a psychiatric hospital so \r\nhe could get treatment. ",
        "Gus: To get him back into the psychiatric hospital. But then he turned the \r\ntables on you, right? He got the needle away from you and he tried to inject you \r\nwith the sedative. And he did, didn't he? And when a civilian does something \r\nlike that that's very dangerous. That can kill a man, couldn't it? Anyway, he \r\nkidnapped your son and he hides him with all the other children. Did that make \r\nyou want to kill him? ",
        "Beth: No, of course not. I couldn't even think about killing phillip. I loved \r\nhim. ",
        "Gus: Come on, now. Even after he kidnapped your child? You were desperate, \r\nweren't you? Desperate to get your son back? ",
        "Beth: Of course I was desperate. He wouldn't be in that situation. But it \r\ndoesn't mean that i would... ",
        "Gus: Wouldn't do something crazy? Your honor I would like to put this as \r\nevidence. ",
        "Judge: Defense exhibit 21. ",
        "Gus: Does this look familiar to you? Credit card statement? ",
        "Beth: Yeah. ",
        "Gus: And you see it's dated here november 11, 2004. It's a deposit for a \r\nhotel room in paris. ",
        "Beth: Yes. ",
        "Gus: Were you going out of town? Were you going someplace? Out of the \r\ncountry? ",
        "Beth: It's not what it seems. ",
        "Gus: What is it exactly? You were going away. Or running away I should say.\r\n",
        "Beth: Why are you doing this to me? ",
        "Gus: What kind of mother vacations when her son gone missing? I don't \r\nunderstand. Unless of course you were planning to abandon your son. ",
        "Beth: No. ",
        "Gus: No? Well, what's the reason exactly? What would posses you to do that? \r\nUnless of course you're running away. Why else would a person do that? ",
        "Beth: I didn't kill phillip. ",
        "Gus: Well, give us another plausible reason for this. ",
        "Beth: It doesn't have anything to do with phillip's death. It's not relevant \r\nto-- ",
        "Gus: Did you book the hotel suite in paris because you were planning to run \r\naway after you killed phillip spaulding? ",
        "Beth: I booked it because i was planning on running away with him... him and \r\nthe children. ",
        "Gus: Let me get this straight. You were planning to take all the children, go \r\nwith them and deprive the other mothers of being with their children just so you \r\ncould be with your own? ",
        "Beth: Only because i thought... ",
        "Gus: You would deceive them like that? Just so you could be with your \r\nchildren? ",
        "Beth: Only because thought... ",
        "Gus: You would deceive like that? Just so you could be with your children?\r\n",
        "Beth: I just that I could... ",
        "Gus: You... you would do that? That size of deception and actually expect \r\nthis court to think that you're not capable of murder. I'm done with this. ",
        "Jeffrey: Your honor? Cross, please? ",
        "Judge: Go ahead, mr. O'neill. ",
        "Jeffrey: Beth, did you kill phillip spaulding? ",
        "Beth: No, I didn'T. ",
        "Jeffrey: No, you didn'T. No further questions. ",
        "Judge: Redirect, mr. Aitoro. You're excused miss raines. Mr. Aitoro, call \r\nyour next witness, please. ",
        "Gus: Yes, judge. The defense calls olivia spencer-lewis. ",
        "Bill: I'm waiting for you to prove that you're not doing alan's bidding. \r\nHere's your chance. Don't hurt harley. ",
        "Jonathan: Why are you so uptight, dynamite? ",
        "Dinah: I told you. I don't want company. ",
        "Jonathan: There's something different about you. You don't look different. \r\nYou don't feel different. ",
        "Dinah: Stop it. Stop it. ",
        "Jonathan: You don't taste different. But, definitely, there's something \r\ndifferent about you. ",
        "Dinah: Maybe I'm trying to change. ",
        "Jonathan: Into what? ",
        "Dinah: A better person. ",
        "Jonathan: Stick with what you know. ",
        "Dinah: Stop it. Don'T.. ( screams ) oh. ",
        "Edmund: Get away from her. ",
        "Jonathan: Lay off me! What's your problem? ",
        "Edmund: My problem I don't like people threatening my fam-- ",
        "Jonathan: Your what? ",
        "Edmund: You're not wanted here, jonathan. Get out. Bother this woman and I'll \r\nhack off your feet and stand you in rock salt. You all rmght? ",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I think so. ",
        "Edmund: What was he doing here? Why did you let him in? ",
        "Dinah: He just knocked on the door and I answered. I thought it was you. \r\nThank you. Thank you from me and the baby. ",
        "Edmund: The procedure was just last night. You're not even pregnant maybe \r\nyet. ",
        "Dinah: I'm pregnant. I know I'm pregnant. In nine months, I'm going to give \r\nyou a baby. You and cassie. I'm going to give you a baby. ",
        "Edmund: Well, if that does end up happening, I would imagine this is going to \r\nbe a very difficult journey for you to carry a child for all that time and just \r\ngive it away. ",
        "Dinah: It's not mine-- not biologically. You and cassie made the baby. I'm \r\njust the carrier. ",
        "Edmund: Well, none the less it's still quite a thing to make a life possible. \r\nIt's an enormous thing as matter of fact. Which is why... I want you to have \r\nthis. ",
        "Reva: Oh, there you are. You got my message. ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Yeah, I just picked it up. ",
        "Reva: Good. So what do you think of my idea? Ready to go? ",
        "Jonathan: Where are we going? ",
        "Reva: Shopping, you nut. I'm going to take you shopping. ",
        "Alexandra: Oh, yes, whatever. Ah, so you don't like coop any more? Which is a \r\nmystery. Since last week you seemed quite smitten by him. ",
        "Lizzie: Now, aunt alex, i told you I didn't like him. This is just an act, \r\nokay? Just so I could get him to do whatever I want. ",
        "Alexandra: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. An act that happen to somehow become real, huh?\r\n",
        "Lizzie: No, okay. He's a cooper. We're spauldings. Spauldings will never mix. \r\nThey're like oil and water. ",
        "Alexandra: Well, hogwash you that. Let me tell you something. And you listen \r\nto this piece of advice if you never listened to anything else from me. Don't \r\nyou ever let your grandfather or anyone else in this world tell you who to care \r\nabout. It's your life, it's your choice. Believe me, I had to learn that one the \r\nhard way. ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, but you know what kind of guy granddad wants me to end up with.\r\n",
        "Alexandra: I know. Someone that's made up in his image. And that's what it \r\nis, darling. It's just image. In the long run, what matters is what's inside.\r\n",
        "Lizzie: You are so right. I could... I could just make coop into the kind of \r\nguy granddad would like. I mean, that would... that would be doable. I mean, \r\nyeah, he'll always be a cooper; I can't change that. But I can do that. ",
        "Alexandra: ( Sighs ) ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, that would be very doable. ",
        "Alexandra: Lizzie. Lizzie. ",
        "Lizzie: Aunt alex, I know what I'm doing, okay? Before I go making over \r\ncoop... he won't know what hit him, okay? Coop. ",
        "Gus: Ms. Lewis, your ex- husband, phillip spaulding, kidnapped your daughter, \r\nisn't that right? ",
        "Olivia: Yes. ",
        "Gus: And then he came to you on the day that he was killed, earlier, and he \r\nsaid that he would return your daughter to you that evening. Is that right? ",
        "Olivia: Yes, um... but i couldn'T... ",
        "Gus: Couldn't what? Ms. Lewis? ",
        "Olivia: I couldn't tell any of the others that I was meeting him, or the deal \r\nwas off and i would never see my daughter again. ",
        "Gus: Funny, because he said the same exact thing to dr. Bauer and to ms. \r\nRaines. Anyway, let's fast-forward to the night of the murder. ",
        "Olivia: I'm sorry, what? ",
        "Gus: The night that your husband was killed. Your ex-husband. When did you \r\nget to company? ",
        "Olivia: Right after he was shot. I think that you were there. ",
        "Gus: Yes, I was. I was actually there when you said that you hope he dies.\r\n",
        "Olivia: I was upset and I... yeah, I said something to that effect. ",
        "Gus: I was also at the funeral when you said, \"he got what he deserved, that \r\nson of a bitch.\" ",
        "Olivia: You know, I... that sounds like something that i would say. ",
        "Gus: Hm. Do you love your daughter, ms. Lewis? ",
        "Olivia: More than anything. ",
        "Gus: You'd do anything to protect her? ",
        "Olivia: Yes. ",
        "Gus: And if somebody... somebody hurt your daughter, you would hurt them \r\nback? ",
        "Olivia: Yes, I would. ",
        "Gus: Well, there you have it. Phillip spaulding, your ex- husband, took away \r\nyour very precious daughter. He ripped your heart out. He made you suffer. And \r\nyou hated him for it, and you wanted to make him pay. ",
        "Olivia: And that is why i completely understand why harley would shoot him.\r\n",
        "Coming up on \"guiding light.\" ",
        "Dinah: Wow, edmund. You should have thought of this sooner. I really do have \r\nyou over a barrel, don't I? ",
        "Gus: So you hated him, is a fair assessment? ",
        "Olivia: Because he was beyond reason, and I knew what he was capable of. \r\nThat's why I understand... ",
        "Gus: Ms. Lewis. ",
        "Olivia: No, that's I want to be able to say that that's why i understand if \r\nharley shot him. Oprah: Emotional torture. ",
        "Gus: Let's not hypothesize as to why other people might have a motive to \r\nshoot your ex-husband. I'm really only interested in yours. When your ex-husband \r\ngot out of ravenwood, the psychiatric facility, he was irrational, wasn't he?\r\n",
        "Olivia: He was very irrational, yes. ",
        "Gus: Did he ever threaten you physically? ",
        "Olivia: More than once. ",
        "Gus: Psychologically? ",
        "Olivia: That, too. ",
        "Gus: Did you trust your ex- husband to be alone with your child? ",
        "Olivia: ( Scoffs ) god, no. ",
        "Gus: So you were afraid of him. ",
        "Olivia: Not only because of what he had done to me, but what I saw him do to \r\nother people, yes. ",
        "Gus: So you hated him, is that a fair assessment? ",
        "Olivia: Because he was beyond reason, and I knew what he was capable of. \r\nThat's why I understand... ",
        "Gus: Ms. Lewis. ",
        "Olivia: No, I want to be able to say that that's why i understand if harley \r\nshot him. ",
        "Gus: Your honor... ",
        "Olivia: Or rick, or beth, or lizzie, or buzz, or even you, gus. You could \r\nhave shot him. Because phillip was sick. He tortured us. He drove us to it, each \r\nand every one of us. He took our babies. He took our babies. We were desperate, \r\nall of us. Desperate parents, afraid for our children's lives, and capable of \r\nanything. ",
        "Anything. Any one of us. ",
        "Jeffrey: Your honor... ",
        "Gus: I don't have any further questions. ",
        "Jeffrey: Mrs. Lewis, I'm going to ask you the same question that I asked dr. \r\nBauer and that I asked ms. Raines. Did you kill phillip spaulding? ",
        "Olivia: No, but... ",
        "Jeffrey: Thank you. ",
        "Judge: The witness may step down. ",
        "Bill: You all right? ",
        "Olivia: ( Sniffles ) did they buy it? I think the tears really got the jury \r\non harley's side, don't you? Are you still mad at me? ",
        "Harley: Is this going as well as I think it is? ",
        "Gus: Your honor, the defense has one last witness we'd like to call. I'd like \r\nto have jack webster to the stand. ",
        "Lizzie: Coop? Why don't you take a break? You've been working really hard.\r\n",
        "Coop: What are you, schizophrenic? Five minutes ago, you had a long list of \r\nto-do things for me. ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I was being really mean. But none of that \r\nstuff absolutely has to get done today. ",
        "Coop: Lizzie, hey. What are you doing, here. Wait, whoa, whoa. ",
        "Lizzie: See that guy over there? Sam rollins. He's a big guy in the \r\nrestaurant world and he's going to help me figure out what I'm going to do with \r\nthis place, make it better. ",
        "Coop: Good for you. ",
        "Lizzie: I mean, he is really plugged-in to the restaurant business. ",
        "Coop: That's good for him. ",
        "Lizzie: Hi, sam. ",
        "Rollins: Ms. Spaulding. ",
        "Lizzie: Nice to meet you. I got your memo and I love your ideas. I want to \r\nintroduce you to someone. Coop. This is sam rollins. Sam rollins, henry cooper \r\nbradshaw. This is the former owner's son. ",
        "Rollins: Nice to meet you, mr. Bradshaw. ",
        "Coop: Yeah, you, too. ",
        "Lizzie: Actually, henry spent some time in london. He was the head of some \r\ntop restaurants there. He's given me some great ideas for this one, and I really \r\nthink that his ideas are indispensable. ( Cell phone rings ) ",
        "Rollins: I'm sorry, excuse me. ",
        "Coop: Yeah, sure. That's fine. I've worked in top-notch restaurants in london? \r\nMy advice is indispensable? ",
        "Lizzie: ( Laughs ) ",
        "Coop: Since when has this happened? ",
        "Lizzie: Okay, so I was talking you up a little bit, that's all. ",
        "Coop: No. You didn't talk me up at all, lizzie. What you did is you lied to \r\nmake me sound better. Now, what is your deal? ",
        "Edmund: It's just something i had drawn up. ",
        "Dinah: It's a contract, between us, for the baby. You want me to sign this?\r\n",
        "Edmund: Well, please don't misunderstand, dinah, but this agreement we've \r\nentered into could become quite complicated, and I have to admit when I was at \r\nthe clinic before, I was thinking with my heart, not my head. ",
        "Dinah: And now in the cold light of day, you don't trust me. Is that right?\r\n",
        "Edmund: Well, I just want both of us to be clear about our obligations and \r\nesponsibilities, so there's no confusion down the road. ",
        "Dinah: You want to make sure that I hand over the baby once it's born, and I \r\ndon't, you know, take off with it or something? Wow, edmund. You should have \r\nthought of this sooner. I really do have you over a barrel, don't I? ",
        "Edmund: Dinah, believe me, this is as much for your benefit as it is for mine \r\nand cassie'S. We just all need to know where we stand. ",
        "Dinah: I'll say. ",
        "Edmund: And if you want to be compensated for your trouble, I'm sure we can \r\narrange something. ",
        "Dinah: I'm already being compensated. With the satisfaction of doing \r\nsomething good for someone i care about. I'm very glad that you had these \r\ncontracts drawn up. I think it's good that we're clear where we all stand, and i \r\nwant you to feel secure about your decision. And I guarantee you that you'll be \r\nsatisfied. I won't let you down. ",
        "Edmund: Thank you for understanding, dinah. Of course, this whole arrangement \r\nmay be moot if you're not pregnant. Then again, even if you are, cassie could \r\nleave me anyway. And I could lose her forever. ",
        "Dinah: We're not going to let that happen. ",
        "Lizzie: I didn't lie. I just stretched the truth a little bit. ",
        "Lizzie: I didn't lie. I just stretched the truth a little bit. And you did \r\nwork at a restaurant in london. ",
        "Coop: Yes, I did, but I was a busboy. ",
        "Lizzie: So what? This guy's huge in the restaurant industry. ",
        "Coop: So what? ",
        "Lizzie: So, he would help you out. ",
        "Coop: Help me with what, lizzie? Am I going to pick out the perfect wheel of \r\ncheese, here? ",
        "Lizzie: He's going to help you get ahead. ",
        "Coop: Ahead. Okay, time out for a second. Where is this coming from? I mean, \r\n20 minutes ago, you wanted me to clean the toilets, and now all of a sudden, you \r\nwant me to get ahead? ",
        "Lizzie: ( Sighs ) ",
        "Coop: Lizzie, I have to ask: What changed? ",
        "Lizzie: I'm your friend and your boss, and I only want to see the best for \r\nyou. ",
        "Coop: Right. ",
        "Jonathan: I still don't know why you were so hell-bent on dragging me into \r\nthat photo booth. ",
        "Reva: Well, because I'm a mama. I want pictures of my son. ",
        "Jonathan: You see this mug every day. Me and lou. ",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, those are for when you're not around. Whew. The fumes down \r\nhere are amazing, you know? I'm a little lightheaded. So, you think we got \r\neverything? ",
        "Jonathan: You tell me. You left me in the C.D. Store and went on a shopping \r\nspree. What did you buy, anyway? A dish rack. Oh, and a toaster. ( Laughs ) reva, \r\nyou have all this stuff. ",
        "Reva: Yeah, I do. But then, you don'T. I got that stuff for your new place. \r\nYou know, to get you started. Because, you know, I'm really sorry, but you're \r\ngoing to have to move out. You can't stay with me and josh anymore. ",
        "Beth: Rick. Rick, wait. ",
        "Rick: For what? So you can betray me again? ",
        "Beth: I really didn't want it to come out like this. ",
        "Rick: No, you had no intentions of telling me, did you? ",
        "Beth: Rick, think back to that night. We were all frantic. We all agreed to \r\nmeet with phillip... ",
        "Rick: You and phillip were going to run away with my son and I was never \r\ngoing to see him again. That's the bottom line, beth. I certainly would never \r\nhave done that to you. ",
        "Bill: You didn't have to make yourself look so bad up on the stand there, \r\nhoney. ",
        "Olivia: I don't really care, as long as it helps harley. It helped her, \r\nright? ",
        "Gus: So, mr. Webster, you ",
        "offered this information in the ",
        "hopes of receiving a reduced ",
        "sentence... ",
        "Bill: Judging from what I saw in the jury's eyes, I would say yes, \r\nabsolutely. ",
        "Webster: Yeah, that's right. ",
        "Gus: Let's recap, shall we? ",
        "Bill: Now, listen, I'm still ticked about selling the building to alan, but \r\nwhen push came to shove, you helped harley. Thank you. ",
        "Gus: You burglarized a ",
        "building and exited the store ",
        "to make your getaway. ",
        "What direction were you facing? ",
        "Webster: South, towards ",
        "company restaurant. ",
        "Gus: And when you looked over towards company, what did you see, mr. Webster?\r\n",
        "Webster: I saw ruth karloff hurrying out onto the porch looking all freaked \r\nout. She rushed down the stairs and took off. Disappeared. ",
        "Gus: And you know ruth karloff to be harley cooper, is that right? ",
        "Webster: Right. Ms. Cooper. ",
        "Gus: And then what happened? ",
        "Webster: I was curious, how come she was so freaked. So I walked up onto the \r\nporch and peered in through the windows, into the restaurant. ",
        "Gus: Mm-hmm. What did you see? ",
        "Webster: Phillip spaulding, standing in the restaurant, drinking a glass of \r\nbeer. ",
        "Gus: So you saw mr. Spaulding alive when harley cooper left. ",
        "Webster: Yes, sir. ",
        "Gus: Mm-hmm. And how are you positive that it was mr. Spaulding? ",
        "Webster: Oh, everybody knows phillip spaulding. He was as close to me as you \r\nare now, and just as much alive. I don't know who killed him, but it wasn't her.\r\n",
        "Gus: Mr. Webster, I cannot thank you enough for setting the record straight. \r\nI'm finished, judge. ",
        "Judge: Mr. O'neill? ",
        "Jeffrey: No questions, your honor. However, the people would request a \r\nsidebar at this time. ",
        "Judge: Your excused, mr. Webster. Approach. ",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, your honor. The state would request permission to call a new \r\nwitness. Someone who's not on our list. ",
        "Gus: What exact... what is this? You've already rested. He rested his case.\r\n",
        "Jeffrey: Mr. Webster was sprung on the court without discovery, so the state \r\nhas the right to be given the opportunity to impeach this testimony. ",
        "Gus: Why did you just dismiss him? ",
        "Jeffrey: Well, because the state feels that mr. Webster cannot provide all \r\nthe answers that we need. No, we need to go to another source. ",
        "Gus: Really? And what's that? What's that source? ",
        "Jeffrey: That's you. ",
        "Coop: Lizzie, what are you doing, here? ",
        "Lizzie: You are such a cooper. Somebody does something nice for you and you \r\njust assume there has to be some kind of ulterior motive. ",
        "Coop: Well, that's because you are a spaulding, and \"ulterior motive\" is your \r\nmiddle name. ",
        "Lizzie: Fine. Forget I even asked anything. Just stay a loser for the rest of \r\nyour life, with no ambition, and who cares if you're that kind of guy that...\r\n",
        "Coop: Whoa. Okay, what kind of guy are you talking about? ",
        "Lizzie: Have dishpan hands the rest of your life, I don't care. ",
        "Coop: Well, here's a news flash for you, lizzie, okay? You're the loser here. \r\nAnd you've also got your priorities screwed up, not me. ",
        "Rollins: Sorry about that. ",
        "Lizzie: It's quite all right. Nice meeting you again. So, what I want to do \r\nis kind of expand this place and, I don't know, how do I do that? ",
        "Rollins: Well, I explained in my memo. ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I know. There's no square footage, but i don't know, maybe \r\nthere's some way. I just want to be the biggest, best restaurant in town. ",
        "Rollins: There's no room on either side. ",
        "Lizzie: But there is an upstairs, so... ",
        "Alexandra: Oh, lizzie. ",
        "Lizzie: ...Maybe I can get a hold of the second floor. ",
        "Alexandra: Lizzie! For pete's sakes. That's the boarding house. That's where \r\nthe coopers live. ",
        "Lizzie: ( Laughs ) well, maybe they can just move out. I mean, hello, you \r\ncannot stop progress, aunt alex. ",
        "Dinah: You know, edmund, you're going to get cassie back. I'm going to give \r\nthe two of you a baby. But you need to stay firm. Stay the course. ",
        "Edmund: I'll just feel better when I know you're actually pregnant. Put \r\nthings a bit more in my control. Which reminds me, you need to have a shot every \r\nday, remember? Now, I can do that for you, or you can go to a hospital, \r\nwhichever you prefer. ",
        "Dinah: I can do that with you, here. That's fine. ",
        "Edmund: Good. Just remember, it's not in the arm. It's in the... ",
        "Dinah: I know. ",
        "Edmund: Right. ",
        "Dinah: That's fine. ",
        "Edmund: All right, then. Let's have at it. You know, I'm actually pretty good \r\nat this. At least, cassie always said that I was. Well, she could have just been \r\nhumoring me, I suppose, but at any rate, I never heard her complain. ",
        "Dinah: Okay. ",
        "Edmund: All right. ",
        "Dinah: Let's have it, doc. ",
        "Jonathan: You're kicking me out. ",
        "Reva: No. ",
        "Jonathan: You know, I thought we were starting to get along. I thought we \r\nwere starting to have fun, huh? I guess the joke's on me. ",
        "Reva: Oh, see, that's it. That's what you do. That's why it has to be this \r\nway. ",
        "Jonathan: What? What do I do? ",
        "Reva: It's the guilt. You know, you act all hurt when what you really are is \r\nticked off because you're not getting what you want. And you know what? You get \r\nat me and you manipulate me. ",
        "Jonathan: Oh, how strange, reva. I can't imagine that there's something that \r\nyou might have to ",
        "Reva: Stop it. Stop that. ",
        "Jonathan: What, is it the fact that my presence every now and then reminds \r\nyou of something you did way back when that ruined the rest of my life? I'm \r\nsorry. How insensitive of me. ",
        "Reva: No, I have to kick you out because-- for lack of a better word-- I \r\ndon't like who I've become. I don't like the person I am when I'm around you all \r\nthe time. Okay? You're very persuasive and you suck me in. And things are very \r\nstrained between me and josh, and they could be permanently ruined for me and \r\ncassie. ",
        "Jonathan: So, just toss me overboard. That makes sense. ",
        "Reva: I love you. I really, really do love you. And I want you in my life but \r\ni just don't want you under my roof. I need other things, too, you know? I need \r\njosh. I need the rest of my family, and I need my friends and I also need a \r\nlittle room to breathe occasionally. ( Laughing ): And the snake is really \r\nstarting to get on my nerves. Oh, come on. It's not going to be that bad. ",
        "Jonathan: Do you think I need you? I don't need you. ",
        "Reva: You'll see. This is going to be best for both of us. I actually got you \r\na room at the clayton arms. You know? That's where you can stay until you find a \r\nplace of your own. I'll even help you look. ",
        "Jonathan: I don't want your help. ",
        "Reva: Okay, well, that's the key to your room if you want to use it. I'm \r\ngoing to pack all your stuff at the house, pack it all up and you can pick it up \r\nsometime tomorrow. Okay? You'll see. This is going to be best for both of us.\r\n",
        "Jonathan: What are you doing? ",
        "Reva: I just... I'm giving you a kiss goodbye because I'm going to catch a \r\ncab. ",
        "Jonathan: That's it? A key, a dish rack and \"goodbye, kid\"? ",
        "Reva: Well, yeah. You know? I'll call you. I'll call you later this evening \r\nto make sure you're getting settled in okay. Okay? I love you. I do. ( Car \r\nstarts ) ",
        "Bill: What's going on? ",
        "Harley: Oh, I have no idea. But jeffrey and alan have been exchanging weird \r\nlooks all morning. ",
        "Bill: I'm sure it's nothing to worry about. ",
        "Harley: I'm not. ",
        "Bill: Okay. All right. ",
        "Gus: Judge... ",
        "Judge: No go, mr. Aitoro. I agree with the D.A. ( Bangs gavel ) ",
        "Harley: What's happening? ",
        "Gus: O'neill is trying to pull something, but it's not going to work. ",
        "Judge: Given the sudden appearance of the defense's surprise witness, the \r\ndistrict attorney has appealed to me to let him call one more witness of his \r\nown, and I have granted his request. Mr. O'neill? ",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, your honor. The state calls mr. Gus aitoro to the stand. ( \r\nSpectators clamoring ) ",
        "Judge: Order. ( Banging gavel ) order, please. Order. Ladies and gentlemen, \r\nplease. ",
        "Next, on \"guiding light.\" ",
        "Jeffrey: Is that you in the photograph? ",
        "Gus: Yeah. ",
        "Jeffrey: And the gentleman in this photograph with you, that's jack webster, \r\nisn't it? The man who just testified on behalf of your client? ",
        "Dinah: I am definitely pregnant. This is your child in here. I've never been \r\nso sure of anything in my whole life. "
