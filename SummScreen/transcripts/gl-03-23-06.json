        "Tammy: Please, go away.",
        "Jonathan: Not until you listen to me.",
        "Tammy: I can't.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy.",
        "Tammy: You have to stop this. Besides, there aren't enough people around. You like an audience, right?",
        "Jonathan: Whatever I have to do to get your attention.",
        "Tammy: It's not going to work. You can't make me change my mind.",
        "Jonathan: You can't run away from this.",
        "Reva: He is right, Tammy, you can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: If you're trying to reach me, don't bother. My reception is terrible in the building.",
        "Mallet: My reception is fine.",
        "Dinah: Good, for you.",
        "Mallet: And the view's not so bad, either.",
        "Dinah: You haven't had your morning coffee yet, have you?",
        "Mallet: You know, I don't know how you stay in that room of yours.",
        "Dinah: Well, maybe I won't. Maybe I'll move out.",
        "Mallet: Maybe you should move out.",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Although I was the first to move into the Beacon, so if you need your space...",
        "Mallet: Did I mention space?",
        "Dinah: ...I think you should be the one to move out.",
        "Mallet: Did I say I needed space?",
        "Dinah: No. I'm just saying. I'm just saying since you're insinuating that there should be some sort of moving out...",
        "Mallet: I'm just saying I think there's a lot of space in here.",
        "Dinah: Huh?",
        "Mallet: Oh, boy, I'm going to spell it out for you.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I guess so.",
        "Mallet: I... I'm asking you to move in with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Well, good morning, Harley. Please, sit down.",
        "Harley: Settling right back in, I see.",
        "Alan: Well, I was trying.",
        "Harley: Finding things pretty much as you left them?",
        "Alan: Some are the same; some things have changed.",
        "Harley: Well, don't get comfortable. Your life as a free man in Springfield is going to be short-lived as long as I have anything to do with it.",
        "Alan: Why do you say that?",
        "Harley: Because you lied to me about Gus and what happened to him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Beth, what a coincidence. I was going to call you later.",
        "Beth: Really? Should I be flattered?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I don't know, that depends. I have a couple of questions about Alan's kidnapping and Gus's disappearance.",
        "Beth: Hmm, it seems like that case is closed to me.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, it's kind of like my job to decide when the case is closed.",
        "Beth: Ah, well, I don't know how I can help you.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you were there with undead Alan for a lot longer than any of us realized.",
        "Beth: You know something, this really isn't a good time for me.",
        "Jeffrey: This won't take long. Now, let's start at the beginning, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Your story about Gus falling through the ice right by the accident site? Bogus, top to bottom. You and Beth made that up, and I can prove it.",
        "Beth: You know what? I'm just really not in the mood to be stuck in an elevator with you.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, well, there was a time not that long ago that you felt otherwise.",
        "Beth: Things change. I'm married now.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, I read something about that in the funny papers.",
        "Beth: And you're with Cassie. You are with Cassie, right?",
        "Jeffrey: You know, why don't we stick to the business at hand?",
        "Beth: ( Laughs ) Oh, what happened, Jeffrey?",
        "Jeffrey: Thanks for your concern.",
        "Beth: Oh, I'm sorry. I just knew that wouldn't work out, anyway.",
        "Jeffrey: As opposed to the great love story that is you and Alan?",
        "Beth: Can't you just be happy for me, Jeffrey? Can't you?",
        "Jeffrey: I would if you would stop evading my questions.",
        "Beth: First of all, you haven't asked me anything specific. And secondly, I don't have the answers you want. You'll have to ask Alan.",
        "Jeffrey: Why are you protecting him?",
        "Beth: I'm not.",
        "Jeffrey: You testified to keep him in the loony bin, and now you're playing the dutiful wife.",
        "Beth: I am nobody's dutiful wife. My decisions are my own. I don't get led around by men like you anymore. Alan didn't do anything wrong, and neither did I.",
        "Alan: I'll have a cup of black coffee.",
        "Harley: You did something to Gus. He was in the cabin.",
        "Alan: Did something, like chop him up and make meat pies out of him? He's my son, Harley. I would never hurt him.",
        "Harley: What about New York?",
        "Alan: What about New York? I went to New York to bring you both home.",
        "Harley: With a gun?",
        "Alan: I wasn't well.",
        "Harley: You weren't well then; you're not well now. You've never been well, Alan.",
        "Alan: Well, a court saw otherwise.",
        "Harley: And they let you out, and look what happens.",
        "Alan: We wouldn't be standing here talking about this if Gus hadn't...",
        "Harley: Oh, you're blaming this on Gus?",
        "Alan: Harley, we would be living a very happy coexistence together if Gus didn't kidnap me that night.",
        "Harley: He was trying to protect me from you.",
        "Alan: You know, that's true, Harley. This is all your fault.",
        "Harley: No, no, you don't get to do that.",
        "Alan: Do what?",
        "Harley: That thing where you talk in circles trying to distract me. Gus was in that cabin, and you're going to tell me what happened to him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: That was fun, Jeffrey. We'll have to do that again sometime.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: So you think Gus was in that cabin? Where's your proof?",
        "Harley: Right here. That's a \"G\" for Gus, carved in the baseboard of the cabin where he was never in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Dinah.",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Mallet: Hello, Dinah. I just asked you to move in with me.",
        "Dinah: Yeah. I know. Um, look, is this different than the \"Hey, I'll make some space for you in the closet\" kind of thing we did recently?",
        "Mallet: No, it still involves closet space, but this is a little different. This is you give up your room, I share the remote full-time, and stuff like that.",
        "Dinah: Oh, okay. What?",
        "Mallet: You can give me an answer.",
        "Dinah: Yes, I could give you an answer.",
        "Mallet: Okay, you know what I'll help you out here. \"Oh, my gosh, A.C. Mallet, it would be so great to wake up in your arms every morning. I know, baby, that's what I'm thinking. When can you move in? Just as soon as I run back to my room and grab all my stuff. I'm so excited. I'll just run over there and give you a big kiss. Then you should do that, honey. Come right over here and give me a big kiss.",
        "Dinah: Okay, stop! Don't do that.",
        "Mallet: This isn't going the way I planned, you know? I'm kind of struggling here.",
        "Dinah: You planned this? This wasn't a spur of the moment kind of thing?",
        "Mallet: No, did it come off like that? What? I don't know how to do this. What's... what do you expect?",
        "Dinah: I'm just saying-- people, normal couples, they realize this is a big moment. It usually is, maybe sometimes a little more romantic.",
        "Mallet: You mean like chocolates, perfume, bath oils?",
        "Dinah: You know what? How do I know you even showered today?",
        "Mallet: I'm not sure I did either. You know what? Let's do this over. I will call room service. Let's just do this over.",
        "Dinah: No, you're not getting it.",
        "Mallet: No, I do get it. I just don't understand. I mean, isn't it automatically a big moment? Because it's a big step; it's a big statement. I mean, it's me offering half my bed, half the bathroom, half the closet space, half the hot water...",
        "Dinah: I'm just... okay. Why are we just talking about living together? Why aren't we just talking marriage?",
        "Mallet: ( Laughs nervously ) Oh. Marriage? Sorry... do you want to marry me?",
        "Dinah: No, of course not!",
        "Mallet: Okay, good, good, good. You want to marry me. I'm sorry. I'm so lost. I'm totally lost. I should stick to football and pizza.",
        "Dinah: Look, Mallet, Mallet.",
        "Mallet: What?",
        "Dinah: I need to know something, and I am not being insecure here, not even a little.",
        "Mallet: All right. What?",
        "Dinah: I just... I want to know that this is about us moving in together and not about you sending a message to Harley.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I have to go to class.",
        "Reva: Tammy, honey, wait.",
        "Tammy: I can't. Just let me be alone right now okay, please? I can't be around him, and I told him that, and now I'm telling you.",
        "Reva: Fine.",
        "Jonathan: What?",
        "Tammy: I don't get it. Why are you here?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, good question.",
        "Reva: I followed him because I knew exactly what he was going to do when he got here.",
        "Tammy: Aunt Reva, what's going on?",
        "Reva: Tammy, you can't run away from him until he accepts what's happening. I just wanted to make sure that was clear with you. If she says stay the hell away from her, then stay the hell away from her.",
        "Jonathan: Stay away from her? Where's that coming from?",
        "Reva: I trusted you. I helped you when you came to me, and you promised me you would treat Tammy right and you wouldn't hurt her.",
        "Jonathan: I didn't. I love her and she loves me. Can't you see that?",
        "Reva: Yeah. I also see what you're doing to her and what you've done to her. And you used me. You used all of us.",
        "Tammy: You didn't know? About the divorce?",
        "Reva: Of course I didn't. He lied to me, too. And now Sandy's dead and Tammy's life...",
        "Jonathan: What? What is Tammy's life without me?",
        "Tammy: Better.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy, you don't mean that.",
        "Tammy: It will be. Just let me move on.",
        "Jonathan: Reva, you have to see...",
        "Reva: No! No. I stood in your corner when no one else would, Jonathan. I'm sorry, but now you're on your own.",
        "Jonathan: I'm on my own. What else is new?",
        "Reva: That's not going to work with me anymore. I'm sorry, Tammy. I'm sorry I let this happen to you.",
        "Tammy: You didn't know.",
        "Reva: I wanted to believe him.",
        "Tammy: Me, too.",
        "Jonathan: None of that matters. What matter's is that you're here and I'm here.",
        "Reva: You think that's enough?",
        "Jonathan: You're going to lecture me about being in a relationship, always doing what's right? Why don't we call Josh and see what he thinks about that?",
        "Tammy: I have to go.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy, look at me and tell me that you don't still love me, that you didn't mean every word you said to me in the hotel room, every vow.",
        "Tammy: I have to go.",
        "Jonathan: Get out of my way, Reva.",
        "Reva: No, no. Maybe that's the problem. Maybe I didn't get in your way enough.",
        "Jonathan: I have to make her understand.",
        "Reva: There is nothing to understand! Jonathan, I said no. I am not through with you yet.",
        "Jonathan: You're going to lecture me about Sandy? Because I've already heard it; I don't need to hear it again.",
        "Reva: This isn't about Sandy! This is about how you broke my heart!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Okay, I think I'm the one who is a little offended now. Because I think there are a few women out there that would be jumping up and down if I asked them to share my space with me.",
        "Dinah: And you don't want any of them?",
        "Mallet: No, I want you. Which is why I don't understand why you keep bringing up Harley.",
        "Dinah: Mallet, look. Maybe you're asking me to move in is your way of telling her you don't want to be her runner- up.",
        "Mallet: But don't make it so hard, okay? It doesn't have to be that complicated.",
        "Dinah: Okay, okay. I'm just saying that Harley has been in this with you and me and she always has been ever since the day we hooked up.",
        "Mallet: Well, not really. Not in that way.",
        "Dinah: Yes, in that way. And I'm not mad about it. I think she has been very good to me, but she's lost her husband and she misses him desperately, and she needs your help. She may also need you for something else.",
        "Mallet: Baby, you're driving me nuts.",
        "Dinah: Am I driving you nuts because I'm driving you nuts? Or am I driving you nuts because I'm right?",
        "Mallet: Because I just don't know what you want me to say right now.",
        "Dinah: You know what, I just want you to admit it, please. Admit it to yourself and admit it to me. Look, I trust you. Hey, it's not that. It's that I have to know that you know about this other thing that's going on here and how it might have affected you asking me to move in.",
        "Mallet: Hmm.",
        "Dinah: That's all.",
        "Mallet: I think you and I joke around a lot to avoid talking about real stuff.",
        "Dinah: Good, you've taken a psych class.",
        "Mallet: A joke, not that funny. See, that was a joke. Come here. Come here. I asked you to move in with me because I like you. And I like being around you. And I kind of like myself when I'm around you. And I asked you to move in with me because, um... I'm kind of selfish, I just don't want to share you with anybody else. And I asked you to move in with me because I've been alone for a long time, and I'm starting to realize I don't have to be alone. I can share my life with someone. And I would like that someone to be you. I mean, you know, share my life-- it's not much. I do have a cell phone that works. And if yours doesn't, I'll put you on my friends and family plan. And as far as Harley goes, I don't want her on my family plan, as great as she is. And, believe it or not, I don't think she had a play in this, not in the slightest. So please, please say yes. Because if you don't, it's going to kill me. And then I'm going to have to kill you.",
        "Dinah: ( Laughing ) Yes. ( Screams )",
        "Mallet: Oh, oh. Okay, I'm going to go back to hiding my feelings now, okay?",
        "Dinah: No, don't you dare. No!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: What is that?",
        "Harley: It's a baseboard from the cabin where I found Alan and Beth. And, look, somebody carved a \"G\" in it.",
        "Jeffrey: And you think it was Gus?",
        "Harley: Oh, I know it was Gus.",
        "Alan: You know, I'm really happy that our district attorney is here to witness-- once again-- your sloppy detective work, Harley.",
        "Harley: The carving is new.",
        "Alan: I carved it in my grief. It gave me something to remember Gus by. I didn't finish it, obviously.",
        "Harley: You're lying, Alan. Look, I don't know what Gus' intention was when he nabbed you, but I do know that if he died in this accident, you wouldn't be grieving for him, and you certainly wouldn't be carving things in remembrance.",
        "Alan: Of course, Harley, I was furious with Gus. Everyone knows about our troubled past. But he was my son, my flesh and blood. And I had to express my feelings some way. I was out there all alone, so I carved that on here, and I obviously didn't finish it. I'm sorry, if this gave you some kind of false hope that he may be alive.",
        "Harley: Are you buying any of this?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I've got a few questions of my own for Mr. Spaulding. As a matter of fact, Mrs. Spaulding has graciously suggested that we all sit down and have breakfast and work this whole thing out. As a matter of fact, it will be my treat.",
        "Alan: I think that's a very good idea, but you'll have to make an appointment. My wife and I are late for our...",
        "Beth: Sonogram.",
        "Alan: Sonogram at Cedars.",
        "Jeffrey: Where can I reach you?",
        "Alan: Why don't you try Spaulding Enterprises? I'll be back running the place very soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Well, I am very proud of you, Beth. You didn't come close to cracking.",
        "Beth: How many times do I have to prove to you I'm just as strong as you are, Alan, or does your bad heart need reminding?",
        "Alan: No, it's healing very nicely, thank you. I just want to remind you that Harley is not going to give up, though.",
        "Beth: I understand.",
        "Alan: Good, because if you can't help me accomplish what I want to accomplish...",
        "Beth: What? What will you do to me, Alan?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: I knew he'd lie. I don't know why I even bothered.",
        "Jeffrey: He seemed pretty convincing.",
        "Harley: You're kidding, right?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, what would he have that says otherwise?",
        "Harley: Beth's face. That woman is lying. I can tell.",

        "Rob Bogue, \"Inside The Light.\" I think his respect for the law and then his total disregard for rules, that's interesting, too. Mallet's special episode I think will show the inner workings of Mallet. I think you'll see he's much more haunted and in pain than often he shows the world.

        "Jonathan: So is this the part when you make it all about you?",
        "Reva: Oh, no, no, no. No, this is about you, Jonathan. This is all about you.",
        "Jonathan: Well, you're damn right it is, Reva. Tammy is my life, she is everything to me. You tell me to stay away from her?",
        "Reva: For good reason.",
        "Jonathan: No, you do not get to do this to me now, Reva. What happened to standing by me? What happened to being on my side?",
        "Reva: What happened to you turning your life around and getting past all this rage and hurt?",
        "Jonathan: I was trying. I never made you any promises; I never made Tammy any promises.",
        "Reva: Because you couldn't keep one.",
        "Jonathan: You were supposed to be on my side. We had a deal.",
        "Reva: Yeah, and you blew it. You looked me dead in the eye and you swore to me that you knew nothing about Sandy's divorce. And then you brought me into that lie.",
        "Jonathan: Sandy, Sandy, Sandy! I am your son, not him! You owe me!",
        "Reva: And what about what you owe me, huh? I gave up my sister, I gave up my marriage, I ripped my family apart siding with you, and it's something I don't think I'm ever going to be able to fix.",
        "Jonathan: So what? You're just going to abandon me now?",
        "Reva: You need to see that you are a grown man and that your actions have consequences.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, come on! What, are you going to give me some wisdom? You're going to teach me a lesson? Save it, Reva. If anybody has a life that's more messed up than mine, it is you, Reva. It is you.",
        "Reva: Why can't you just admit that you were wrong and say you're sorry?",
        "Jonathan: Because I'm not. I was not wrong. Tammy was going to marry a guy who would never make her happy. Is that the kind of life you wanted her to have?",
        "Reva: Of course not.",
        "Jonathan: Well, I fixed it. I stopped it from happening, me, your son. Does it really matter how?",
        "Reva: Yes. Yes! It matters.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, what, are you going to get up on your high pulpit now? I know you, Reva. You would have done the same exact thing.",
        "Reva: Yeah, we are a lot alike, you and me. I've done a lot of things that I'm not proud of, and I'm not perfect, but I never pretended to be either. And the one difference between us is that when I make a mistake, I own up to it!",
        "Jonathan: Oh, please, please! You are trying to control me. You tell me you love me; I do one thing that you don't like, and watch out! Because I'm seeing the back of your head quicker than I can say \"mommy\"! I guess that's what I should expect though. You just want me to be alone so I'll be as miserable as you are.",

        "Jeffrey: I can see how you thought that, you know, Gus might have carved this.",
        "Harley: I still do.",
        "Jeffrey: So you're going to completely discount Alan's story?",
        "Harley: Yes, because that's what it is, a story.",
        "Jeffrey: Harley, I know how much you want this to be true. I've seen all the twists and turns and all the ups and downs that you've been through the past few months.",
        "Harley: I should move on?",
        "Jeffrey: I'm the guy that told you to follow your gut, remember?",
        "Harley: Yeah, and what happened?",
        "Jeffrey: Let me see this through. I promise I will, okay? Maybe you're not the right person to be on this case right now.",
        "Harley: I need to do this.",
        "Jeffrey: I understand that. I'm just saying, you know, it's possible to be too close to a case. Sometimes it's possible to get in too deep. I should know.",

        "Alan: Beth, it wasn't a threat. It was merely a suggestion, that's all.",
        "Beth: Right. Alan, I've been on the receiving end of your venom enough to know the difference. Tread lightly. Let's not forget public perception of me. I'm the town victim, poor, pathetic Beth. Don't think I won't play that card if I have to.",
        "Alan: Wait a minute. What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Beth: I'll tell people what really happened to Gus. And I'll say you manipulated me into going along. And then you'll be in your cell, and the baby and I will fill our days spending your money.",
        "Alan: You really know how to hurt a guy, don't you?",
        "Beth: I thought that might get your attention.",
        "Alan: Listen, I want you to know if there's anything that I said that sounded like a threat to you, I apologize. You are carrying our child, and its happiness and health is the most important thing to me. It means everything, and, therefore, so do you.",
        "Beth: Now, do you see how easy it is to make nice, hmm?",
        "Alan: Oh, but we have to be strong, remember that. Because it's only a matter of time before this town will think that Harley Cooper is nothing but a crazed widow. And you and I will reclaim the Spaulding legacy for ourselves and for our children.",
        "Beth: You, you make it sound so simple.",
        "Alan: It is simple. All you have to remember is that Gus is gone, and then we will live the high life. ( Laughter )",

        "Mallet: What? How's that?",
        "Dinah: Oh, I didn't negotiate closet space or drawer positioning.",
        "Mallet: Drawer positioning? It's a hotel suite. There aren't that many drawers.",

        "Dinah: Okay. I think that we should do it right here.",
        "Mallet: What are you talking about? Like with room service?",
        "Dinah: Yes. I think that we should have a dinner party. We should make all the planning and have it here. I can even invite a few couples. It'll be like a coming-out party.",
        "Mallet: So you want to host a dinner party?",
        "Dinah: Yes. I think it would be awesome. I think that it would be our way of sort of announcing to the world that we are living together. Sort of like the first day of our lives.",

        "Dinah: As whatever.",

        "Jeffrey: Well, fancy seeing you here.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I guess you could say that. I'll go with that. What's up?",

        "Dinah: Are you kidding me? I don't believe it.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I guess a relationship is only as strong as the top-secret mission that it's built on. I guess some people just aren't cut out for the long haul-- especially you and me, huh?",
        "Dinah: Well, I'm very sorry, District Attorney, but I have turned over a new leaf in my life. In fact, it couldn't be any more different.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. Well, I told myself the very same thing.",
        "Dinah: Look, what happened between you and Cassie? I thought you guys were...",
        "Jeffrey: We were based on a lie, a lie I told her, a lie I told myself.",

        "Jonathan: No. I will get Tammy back. And I don't need your help, Reva. I don't need you, Reva. I've done it long enough on my own. Going solo again ain't going to be a big deal.",
        "Reva: Tammy's mind is made up. And your trying to change it is only going to bring you a world of heartache.",

        "Jonathan: I can make her happy.",

I just wanted you to know that, and I'm at the farm, so if you get this message, call me back, and if you think you're going to be home any time soon... well, I'll wait for you.

First he kills Phillip, and now this thing with Gus. He's evil. And if I were you, I would keep that baby as far away from him as possible. Beth, don't you see I want to help you?
