        "Cassie: Who's it from? Who's it from? (Laughs) ",
        "Michelle: It's from Danny. ",
        "Cassie: Oh, well, let's see what it is. ",
        "Michelle: Wow. They're golden love birds. ",
        "Cassie: That is so sweet, Michelle. ",
        "Michelle: Yeah. It is. You know, all these really fun, thoughtful gifts from \r\nDanny keep showing up. Why doesn't he? ",
        "",
        "Alan: Phillip, we need to talk about the baby-- my baby. There are a few \r\nthings that we need to straighten out. (Cell phone ringing) ",
        "Phillip: Uh, I need to take this. Hello? Alan's voice activated Olivia's \r\ncell. He did it. He set Olivia up. ",
        "Alan: Well, who was that? ",
        "Phillip: It was you. ",
        "Alan: What? ",
        "Phillip: You lied to me. Again. Not five minutes ago, you stood here and you \r\nlooked me in the eye and you told me that you didn't set Olivia up, but it was \r\nyou. ",
        "Alan: Phillip... ",
        "Phillip: You did do it. ",
        "Alan: Phillip, that's just... ",
        "Phillip: Why don't I know by now that everything you tell me is a lie? ",
        "Alan: What are you talking about? ",
        "Phillip: Because you said you loved her. That's obviously a lie, because \r\nyou're willing to see her behind bars. Or, no, actually you're hoping that she's \r\ngoing to do serious time, and this is the woman who's carrying your child. ",
        "Alan: Wait, wait, you've got this all wrong. ",
        "Phillip: Or rather, who could be carrying your grandchild. But it doesn't \r\nmake any difference to you. ",
        "Alan: I would never... ",
        "Phillip: To hell with her, right? Just let her rot in jail. You wouldn't \r\nwhat? You would never want to hurt Olivia? You'd never want to punish her for \r\nchoosing me or anybody else over you? ",
        "Alan: If you will just let me speak! ",
        "Phillip: Oh, say anything that you'd like, Dad, because I'm through \r\nlistening! I'm through with all of it! I am finished! I am done! ",
        "",
        "Gus: I don't understand this. ",
        "Lucia: I'm your mother. You can start with that. ",
        "Alexandra: Please, this is not the time, the place. ",
        "Lucia: I will not disappear again just to suit you. ",
        "Harley: Why does this suit you? ",
        "Lucia: My son has come back into my life. Call it fate or an act of God, I \r\ncan't ignore it anymore. Nicholas... ",
        "Gus: How can this... how can this be? You were the nice lady up the street.\r\n",
        "Lucia: You said it yourself at the convent. It seemed like I was part of the \r\nfamily. I was. I know, I know, there's so much to explain. Forgive me. I never \r\nstopped loving you. ",
        "Gus: But you became someone else and then you disappeared? ",
        "Lucia: No, I couldn't stay behind that screen. I stayed silent. I could have \r\ngone on pretending, but I couldn't let you suffer anymore. ",
        "Gus: Well, that's good because I feel great right now. ",
        "Alexandra: Okay, okay, that's really enough. ",
        "Harley: This is enough. You need to do some talking. Why is she here? Why? \r\nAnd what does any of this have to do with you? ",
        "Alexandra: Look, Harley... ",
        "Harley: I have a better idea. Why don't we give them some privacy? All right, \r\nI am not fooling around with you. I want the answers, Alexandra. I want them \r\nnow. What do you have riding on all this? ",
        "Alexandra: Oh, God. Gina... Lucia was my friend, that's all. ",
        "Harley: When she was Phillip's nanny? ",
        "Alexandra: Yes. ",
        "Harley: And? Come on! Alexandra, that woman is not here by accident! What is \r\nall this? ",
        "Alexandra: It is all about protecting her and her son. That's all it's ever \r\nbeen about from the very beginning. ",
        "Harley: Protecting them from what? ",
        "",
        "Lucia: Please don't be angry with me. ",
        "Gus: I'm a lot of things right now. ",
        "Lucia: I know. So am I. ",
        "Gus: All right, look, let's just take it slow, and I'll do my best not to \r\njudge you. ",
        "Lucia: All children judge their parents. ",
        "Gus: Yeah, well, there might be a little bit of that, because I need to \r\nunderstand what happened. ",
        "Lucia: Could we go outside somewhere and talk? It's such a lovely day. ",
        "Gus: Yeah, I know a... I know a little spot. ",
        "Alexandra: Where are you going? ",
        "Gus: We're going for a little walk. ",
        "Harley: Can I just talk to you for a second? ",
        "Alexandra: Do not tell Gus that Alan is his father. ",
        "Gus: Would you do me a favor and not whisper behind my back? What did you \r\njust say to her? ",
        "Alexandra: (Scoffs) ",
        "Gus: What did you just say to her? ",
        "Alexandra: Making plans for later. ",
        "Gus: My car's out front. ",
        "",
        "Alan: Would you tell me what just happened? The phone rings, you take it \r\noutside, you come back inside. ",
        "Phillip: No. Just the opposite. I actually think this may be the most lucid \r\nmoment I've ever had in my life. ",
        "Alan: Phillip, we were having the most civilized conversation that we've had \r\nin months, and suddenly you come back exploding. ",
        "Phillip: No. See, that's it. It's not sudden. It's just the last straw. It's \r\nbeen coming for the last 40 years or so. Ever since the day you brought me in \r\nhere and you started passing me off as your son. ",
        "Alan: You are my son. ",
        "Phillip: But it doesn't make any difference. It's all finished. It's all \r\ndone. You have no hold over me anymore. I am free. ",
        "Alan: I have never tried to keep a hold over you. ",
        "Phillip: Oh, that's right. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You called it \"love.\" And \r\nyou know what? Idiot that I was, I actually did love you. But that's done. It's \r\nfinished. All I feel now is contempt. ",
        "Alan: You don't mean that. ",
        "Phillip: You don't think so? ",
        "Alan: Olivia has poisoned your mind. ",
        "Phillip: Of course, it has to be Olivia... ",
        "Alan: She wants you to believe that I somehow set her up. ",
        "Phillip: Uh-huh. ",
        "Alan: That I concocted some scheme to have her arrested for stalking Reva. \r\nWell, you know what? Just to pay her back, that's a lie. ",
        "Phillip: You may as well calm down. It's different this time. ",
        "Alan: What is? ",
        "Phillip: Our fights have always run the same course, haven't they? You'd do \r\nsomething outrageous, I'd yell and scream, tell you I hated you and storm off. \r\nBut I always came back. ",
        "Alan: Yes, you came back because families fight, but the strong ones forgive.\r\n",
        "Phillip: That sounds very noble, but it's got nothing to do with strength of \r\ncharacter. No, I came back because I was too weak to stay away. ",
        "Alan: Oh, Phillip, that's ridiculous! ",
        "Phillip: No, it's not. It's the truth, and you know it. You always knew it. \r\nYou always knew that there was a part of me that still wanted to please you, \r\nthat wanted to make you proud, and you banked on that. But that account is \r\nclosed. It's done. It's finished. All I want now is out. ",
        "Alan: Don't turn your back on your father. ",
        "Phillip: You're not my father. ",
        "Alan: I raised you. I am your father as much as any man could be. ",
        "Phillip: You're my past. ",
        "",
        "Michelle: You know, Danny doesn't even call to see if I got any of these \r\ngifts that he's sending me, much less return my calls. It's getting a little \r\nweird. ",
        "Cassie: Wow, I didn't realize it was to that extreme. ",
        "Michelle: Exactly. Do you know what he said to me the last time we were \r\ntogether? He said that we were meant to be together and that I shouldn't be \r\nafraid of love. ",
        "Cassie: Well, I think that's romantic. ",
        "Michelle: Yeah. Yeah, but then he all but disappeared, so it kind of took the \r\ntingle out of things. ",
        "Cassie: You sure about that? ",
        "Michelle: Well, I'm sure that you've seen him. ",
        "Cassie: Yes, I have, and I know that he has been very, very busy. ",
        "Michelle: Right, right, and business and business partners come first, I \r\nunderstand. ",
        "Cassie: No, he's just really busy working on this new project. ",
        "Michelle: Well, what's the new project? ",
        "Cassie: We're renovating the 5th Street district. ",
        "Michelle: Are you kidding? ",
        "Cassie: No. ",
        "Michelle: A whole neighborhood? ",
        "Cassie: Whole thing. ",
        "Michelle: Wow. I mean, I had no idea Danny was tackling something that big.\r\n",
        "Cassie: Look at these copies of the artist's conception. ",
        "Michelle: Oh, my God. It's like a whole new community. ",
        "Cassie: Well, that's the whole idea. You know, we take the slums and we make \r\nit this thriving, livable, new part of the city. It's amazing. ",
        "Michelle: Wow. When Danny Santos goes legit, he really goes all the way. ",
        "Cassie: He is giving it 110%, Michelle, he is. ",
        "Michelle: Yeah, and he's giving me the birds. Not that they're not adorable. \r\nIt just makes me wonder. ",
        "Cassie: Makes you wonder what? ",
        "Michelle: Well, you're telling me Danny's so unbelievably busy, and yet he's \r\ngot time to plan this multi-gift campaign. ",
        "Cassie: Because he loves you. ",
        "Michelle: Then why doesn't he call me and tell me, or just show up and say \r\nit? ",
        "Cassie: Not many guys would send you a pair of beautiful golden love birds, \r\nMichelle. ",
        "Michelle: I know. It was a sweet gesture. If that's all that it is. ",
        "Cassie: Okay, now I don't understand. ",
        "Michelle: Well, I don't know if I do, either. It just seems like Danny is \r\nplaying some kind of game with me. Has Danny said anything to you at all? ",
        "Cassie: Nothing. Except how crazy he is about you. ",
        "Michelle: Yeah, well, I wish he would stop acting crazy because it's making \r\nme nuts. See, do you want to know how my mind goes in all this? ",
        "Cassie: Can I take it? ",
        "Michelle: I just start thinking that he's gone back to this place of not \r\ntrusting me. ",
        "Cassie: You got that out of two love birds? ",
        "Michelle: Well, because it could be about control. See, yes, Danny is willing \r\nto send me romantic gifts, but, no, he's not willing to let me make up my own \r\nmind or make my own choices about our relationship. ",
        "Cassie: You are nuts. ",
        "Michelle: Thanks. ",
        "Cassie: It just doesn't make sense, Michelle. ",
        "Michelle: Well, neither does Danny's version of the invisible man. ",
        "Cassie: I think you just miss him. ",
        "Michelle: Or maybe he's trying to make me miss him. ",
        "Cassie: Is that so terrible? ",
        "Michelle: Well, it totally takes me out of the mix. I mean, he's not taking \r\ninto consideration what I want. ",
        "Cassie: Okay. What do you want? If he would have hand-delivered these birds, \r\nwould you have wrapped your arms around him? Or would you have slapped him \r\nacross the face? Because by how you're acting, I don't know what you would have \r\ndone. (Cell phone rings) Sorry. Hello? ",
        "Danny: Hey. Don't let Michelle know it's me. It's Danny. ",
        "Cassie: I didn't realize that you were aware of my situation. ",
        "Danny: Yeah, well, I almost walked right into the two of you. I'm right \r\noutside the entrance. Can you get somewhere where Michelle can't hear you? ",
        "Cassie: Hold on. Excuse me, this is business. What are you doing? I feel like \r\nI should be wearing, like, a trench coat, sunglasses and hat. ",
        "Danny: I know, I know. I thought Michelle would be out of there by now. Did \r\nshe like the birds? ",
        "Cassie: She loved the birds. What's going on? ",
        "Danny: Meet me outside. ",
        "Cassie: You know what, Michelle? I have to run outside. There's an electrical \r\nproblem with these new lights I'm putting up and they need me, so I'll be right \r\nback. ",
        "Michelle: Okay, sure. ",
        "",
        "Harley: Hey. ",
        "Buzz: That good a day, huh? ",
        "Harley: Let me ask you something, Dad. ",
        "Buzz: Okay. ",
        "Harley: When was the last time you had a chat with your good friend, \r\nAlexandra Spaulding? ",
        "Buzz: Not so long. Why? ",
        "Harley: Because I was hoping that maybe you could be the one to tell me what \r\nthe hell she's thinking. ",
        "Buzz: You want to talk to me? ",
        "Harley: You know what? When I gave up Daisy for adoption, there was not a \r\nday-- not a day-- that I did not think about that child. ",
        "Buzz: And this is on your mind because? ",
        "Harley: Because I don't understand what makes some people tick. Gus found out \r\nwho his... who his mother is today. ",
        "Buzz: Is? I thought she was dead. ",
        "Harley: She was hiding. Yes, hiding. Behind a nun's habit. It was a lie. The \r\nwhole thing was... it was a lie. But she was in his life. Oh, yeah, when he was \r\nlittle, she was pretending to be some woman who was just, you know, a lady in \r\nthe neighborhood kind of thing. ",
        "Buzz: What? ",
        "Harley: Yes. Yeah, she'd come over to his house, she'd bake him birthday \r\ncakes and she would play with him and she'd baby-sit, you know? And when he was \r\ngood and used to her-- he's, like, five, six years old-- she takes off. ",
        "Buzz: Why? ",
        "Harley: That is a very good question: Why? But take off she did, for, like, \r\n30 years, and then your friend Alexandra lies and lies to Gus so that he doesn't \r\nfind out who she really is. ",
        "Buzz: Sounds like the lady has a story. ",
        "Harley: Yes, well, let's hope Gus can get it out of her. But how can you do \r\nthat? You know what I mean? As a parent, how do you do that to your kid? ",
        "Buzz: Well, speaking as a former absentee parent, there's always a reason. \r\nNever a good one, but... ",
        "Harley: Well, I wasn't talking about you this time, Dad. I wasn't, really.\r\n",
        "Buzz: One of the big, sad things about this world is that most often, kids \r\nget hurt by their parents. Alex, her part in this, I mean, she hasn't been \r\nexactly in the sharing mode since she came back to town. ",
        "Harley: Yeah. Well, let me ask you this: How far do you think she'd be \r\nwilling to go to get things to come out her way? ",
        "Buzz: Alex, she's as tough as they come. I mean, brutal sometimes. ",
        "Harley: You mean in that wonderful Spaulding way? ",
        "Buzz: No, no. She's different than that gang. She'd never hurt somebody just \r\nbecause she could. She's not spiteful. ",
        "Harley: Oh, so she has her reasons for wrecking people's lives. ",
        "Buzz: Somehow it's all about love. ",
        "Harley: That's not a reason, Dad. It's an excuse, and it's a lousy one. ",
        "",
        "Alexandra: What's wrong? ",
        "Alan: Your nephew has just lost his mind. ",
        "Phillip: (Laughs) No, it's all right. Come on in, Alex. You should hear \r\nthis. ",
        "Alexandra: Hear what? ",
        "Alan: Pay no attention to him. He's having a psychotic meltdown. ",
        "Phillip: Right, because I am finally cutting the cord. I am severing the \r\nties. Pick any expression you like. I am leaving this family's garbage behind: \r\nAll the lies and the manipulation, the emotional blackmail. I'm done! I'm done! \r\nI'm out of the company. I'm out of the house. I am out of this family! ",
        "Alexandra: What? To do what? ",
        "Phillip: Oh, hell, I don't know. Start a new life someplace. Hey, maybe with \r\nOlivia and the baby. Maybe they'll be my family now. ",
        "Alexandra: All right, you can't... you can't just walk away and pretend \r\nyou're not a Spaulding, for heaven's sakes, Phillip. I mean, no matter how angry \r\nyou get, you are one of us. ",
        "Phillip: No, I'm not. I never really was. ",
        "Alexandra: (Sputters) ",
        "Phillip: It's okay. You know what? I'll... I'll leave my office keys with \r\nsecurity. ",
        "Alexandra: No, you can't go, because you will ruin everything. ",
        "",
        "Lucia: There was a tree like that in the empty lot behind Joe and Angela's \r\nhouse. ",
        "Gus: It was cut down to make room for a bunch of condos. ",
        "Lucia: Nicholas, if I had known both your parents had died so young... ",
        "Gus: You would have what? You would have taken care of me and my new little \r\nsister? ",
        "Lucia: You deserved to have a mother all those years. You deserved to be \r\nloved. ",
        "Gus: Yeah, well, it's a shame it didn't work out. ",
        "Lucia: I feel like a thief. ",
        "Gus: Who was my father? The least you can do is tell me that. You know, \r\nAlexandra Spaulding has had me chasing my tail around for months on end now. Who \r\nis my father? Who is my father? ",
        "Lucia: Miguel Santos. ",
        "Gus: God. I mean, that makes perfect sense. It's just lately, lately I was \r\nsure it was somebody else. ",
        "Lucia: I hadn't planned on becoming pregnant, especially with him. ",
        "Gus: Well, he wasn't a very nice guy. ",
        "Lucia: No. But when I found out I was going to have a child, I wasn't sorry \r\nbecause I was already loving the little boy inside of me. ",
        "Gus: Well, how did Miguel feel about that? ",
        "Lucia: He didn't know. I wouldn't tell him. You know what kind of a man he \r\nwas. I was afraid he'd come after... come after me and take away my baby. He \r\nacted like he owned me-- why not the child we made together? ",
        "Gus: Well, how did you... what, did you hide the fact that you were pregnant?\r\n",
        "Lucia: After the first couple of months, I wore nothing but loose clothing, \r\nand then I always made sure to keep my body turned away from him when he came to \r\nvisit. ",
        "Gus: Visit you where? ",
        "Lucia: In a hotel he owned, in Chicago. I had to quit my job with the \r\nSpaulding's. I couldn't stay in that house. ",
        "Gus: Why... why did you bother staying at all? Why didn't you leave town? ",
        "Lucia: I was afraid he'd come after me. I knew he would. Besides, Joe \r\nAugustino told me that he was going to help me. ",
        "Gus: Pop. ",
        "Lucia: I met him when he was first on the force, and then when he was on \r\nleave from the army, he stopped by the old neighborhood to say hello. ",
        "Gus: You tell him your little situation? ",
        "Lucia: Yes. And then he told me how desperate he and Angela were to have a \r\nchild. It was too perfect. I wanted to give my son a better life than I could \r\ngive him and here was a young couple aching to have a family. ",
        "Gus: So you cut a deal? ",
        "Lucia: No, it wasn't like that. I never said a word. I waited. I knew that \r\nJoe would be there when I went into labor. He was. He delivered you. I couldn't \r\ngo to a hospital. ",
        "Gus: Why? Because you were afraid Miguel would come after me? ",
        "Lucia: Yes. That's when I told Joe what I wanted, when you were only a few \r\nminutes old. You should have seen his face. ",
        "Joe: I can't do this, Gina. ",
        "Gina: It's for him, so he'll have the life he deserves. ",
        "Joe: There are laws about giving up babies, adoption. ",
        "Gina: I don't care about the laws. You and Angela are good people. No one \r\ncould treat my baby better than you. ",

        "Harley: Love. I'll tell you Dad, what people do for love, it makes me sick.\r\n",
        "Buzz: It's not that bad. ",
        "Harley: Oh, it's bad enough. Come on, look at Phillip, keeping Zach from me \r\nfor months and months and months. Why? All in the name of love-- he says. And \r\nnow, Alexandra torturing Gus, lying to him, for what? Love? That's love? ",
        "Buzz: For someone who's in love herself, that's awfully cynical. ",
        "Harley: Cynical, no. It's just I'm a cop, okay, and I'm telling you, most of \r\nour caseloads are crimes of passion. And that's not me. That's statistics. ",
        "Buzz: If being a cop makes you focus on the dark stuff and go right past the \r\nlight, I think you should, like, readjust your vision here. And I say that with \r\nlove. (Cell phone rings) ",
        "Harley: Cooper. No, detective Aitoro is not with me. Well, if you can't get \r\nin touch with him, he probably turned off his cell phone. What's up? What? What \r\nlab results for what case? Oh! No, no, no, no. He's not going to want to wait \r\nfor those. I'll pick those up myself. I'll be right there. Thanks. Thanks for \r\nthe little chat, Dad. Oh, and I say that with love. ",

        "Alexandra: Well, what about Lizzie and James and Zachary? I mean, where is \r\nthis going to leave them? ",
        "Phillip: Maybe with a father who is happy for the first time in a great many \r\nyears. ",
        "Alan: And I wonder how long that's going to last. ",
        "Phillip: As long as I'm away from all of this. ",

        "Alexandra: Phillip, please. ",
        "Alan: No, wait, wait, look. I know that you and I have our issues and we've \r\nhad our problems in the past. Some of them are so deep, they may never be \r\nresolved, but you are a Spaulding and we never give up or give in. That's what \r\nmakes our family strong. Don't go. It doesn't... it doesn't have to end this \r\nway. ",

        "Cassie: I don't think she sees it like that. ",
        "Danny: Well, I don't want her pushing me away again. So what do you think? Is \r\nshe sold on me yet? 100% trusting? ",
        "Cassie: No. ",
        "Danny: No? Why? Because she's afraid? ",

        "Danny: What are you saying? That you think that same thing she does? That \r\nI'll let her down again? ",
        "Cassie: No. I know that you would never intentionally hurt her. I know that. \r\nBut you guys have a lot of history you need to work through here. ",
        "Danny: Well, no kidding. That's why I'm doing this whole Fifth Street \r\nproject, to prove to her and to other people that I can commit to legit \r\nbusiness. (Sighs) All right. Look, you have been a great help with all of it.\r\n",
        "Cassie: That's me, your friendly neighborhood front girl. ",

        "Gus: So Joe took me home and raised me as his own with his wife, Angela. And \r\nwhen you felt like I was okay, you made sure Miguel couldn't come after you by \r\npretending that you were dead in that hotel. ",
        "Lucia: Joe and his partner arranged all that. They didn't tell me what was \r\nhappening and I didn't ask. All I knew was that Gina was gone and I'd become \r\nLucia. ",
        "Gus: So you changed your name. Why bother staying in town at all? ",
        "Lucia: They begged me to stay, to be a part of your life. ",
        "Gus: That's why there were so many visits. ",
        "Lucia: They found me a place to live, right up the block. I watched you grow \r\nfrom a tiny little infant into a beautiful little boy. ",
        "Gus: And then you split. ",
        "Lucia: I was a coward. I couldn't take it anymore. ",
        "Gus: You couldn't take what? ",
        "Lucia: The lie. I thought it would get easier watching Angela raise you year \r\nafter year. It only got harder. Every time I saw you, I wanted to whisper in \r\nyour ear, \"I'm your mama.\" I came so close. One day in spring-- it was a day \r\njust like today-- I was going for a walk in that little part along Grant Street?\r\n",
        "Gus: The carousel. ",
        "Lucia: Yes. And I heard a laugh, a child's laugh. It was you. Joe and Angela \r\nhad come to take you and Eden on a picnic. (Laughter) ",

        "Joe: (Laughs) We're not sleeping, though, are we, Tiger? ",

        "Gus: Yeah. I do. I guess you had no real way of knowing that things could get \r\nso rough. Nobody thinks a kid's parents are going to die so young, especially \r\nthe kid. ",

        "Alexandra: Okay. All right, Alan, you do what you do best. You blame everyone \r\nelse for your failings, your shortcomings. You forced Phillip away. You're the \r\none that drove Olivia out of your life. ",
