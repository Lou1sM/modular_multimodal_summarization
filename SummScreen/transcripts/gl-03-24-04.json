How did you get?", "Harley: I used the key in the planter button. Come here doris wolfe is about to make an announcement about marah.", "Reva: Yeah, I know. I was at the police station.", "Doris wolfe: Thank you all for coming. As of this evening, I have decided to convene a grand jury to bring charges against marah lewis in the shooting death of ms. Caroline carruthers.", "Reva: I can't hear anymore of this.", "Harley: I can't believe this. What happened?", "Reva: Well, wolfe decided to test the cloak carrie was wearing that night. Evidently she found out the bullet hole went in the back of the cape. She thinks that marah deliberately shot the woman in the back.", "Harley: Well, that's ridiculous.", "Reva: Well, you and I both know that.", "Harley: Yeah, we know it. Now we have to prove it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: Why am I doing this?", "Cassie: Boo.", "Tammy: Mom! You scared me to death. What are you doing?", "Cassie: I was just wondering the same thing about you. Personnel files? Tammy?", "Tammy: I can explain.", "Cassie: Really? I'd love to hear it.", "Tammy: Right. I guess I should have just asked him first. But...", "Cassie: Asked who what?", "Tammy: Lizzie has a thing for one of the bellmen, richie. She asked me to get his number.", "Cassie: Are you kidding me?", "Tammy: Well, he's hot.", "Cassie: Okay, fine. But you know what? These are confidential. You shouldn't be looking at these.", "Tammy: I didn't know it was such a big deal. I'm sorry.", "Cassie: It's okay. This time. You know, I don't want you letting lizzie get you in trouble. I can't believe I'm letting you hang out with her.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Cassie, I've come with an apology for you. And I'm not letting you go anywhere until you hear it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: Okay. Robbie's had his bath, he's tucked in waiting for mommy.", "Michelle: Honey, according to this...", "Danny: What is this?", "Michelle: ...Your numbers with women voters is not at all where it should be. But I have an idea.", "Danny: We don't have to do this right now. This can wait.", "Michelle: The league of women voters, their monthly meeting is day after tomorrow and I think you should talk to them again.", "Danny: I know what you're doing. It's not necessary.", "Michelle: Helping my husband isn't necessary?", "Danny: Michelle, you don't have to make up for anything.", "Michelle: Right, right, because I only almost cost you the whole election, danny.", "Danny: Come on, you didn't cost me anything. Nothing happened.", "Michelle: I want to show you something, okay?", "Danny: Can we do this later? This really... robbie's waiting for you.", "Michelle: Hang on a second.", "Danny: We can find it later.", "Michelle: I want to show you this.", "Danny: It's okay.", "Michelle: Danny, it's not okay. Nothing is okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: You're carrie. You stand right over there. Here, this is your josh. Now, you've got a gun pointed on him, okay? I'm marah, I'm standing here and I'm watching carrie and josh struggle for the gun. So struggle.", "Reva: Struggling.", "Marah: Now I'm seeing this. I'm seeing what's happening. I know my father's in trouble and I have to do something.", "Reva: So marah sees the gun on the ground.", "Harley: And she's pointing it at carrie, but she's afraid of pointing the trigger because she hasn't got a clear shot. She points the gun at carrie, aims and fires.", "Reva: But carrie moves, bang, the shot goes in the be the back. Marah couldn't possibly know she was going to hit her in the back.", "Harley: Of course not. Does she know about the grand jury?", "Reva: No, not yet.", "Harley: Who's going to tell her?", "Reva: Well, I guess I will be the one to tell her. But how do I do it? How do I tell my baby girl that the assistant district attorney is going to put her in jail for murder?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Doris wolfe: Good evening. I am here with an update in the caroline carruthers' case. As you already know, marah lewis was arrested for the murder of ms. Carruthers. Now, in light of new evidence that has come to the district attorney's office, I am extremely confident that the grand jury will bring an indictment in this case and that marah lewis will be punished to the fullest extent of the law.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: Michelle, hey, listen to me. You cannot put your entire life back in order all at once. You've got to give yourself time. (Knock at the door) right?", "Michelle: Uh-huh.", "Marina: Hey, you ready?", "Michelle: For what?", "Marina: You we're manning hotlines, remember?", "Michelle: I meant to call you. I can't do it tonight.", "Marina: Why not?", "Michelle: Because I can'T.", "Danny: You scheduled at the center tonight?", "Michelle: Yeah, and I was telling marine that but I can'T.", "Marina: And you didn't tell me why.", "Michelle: Are you guys listening to me? I said no, okay?", "Marina: Robbie upstairs?", "Danny: Yeah. He's probably asleep.", "Marina: I'll just peak... peek in and I won't get him riled up.", "Danny: Give me a couple minutes.", "Michelle: I'm not going, danny, okay?", "Danny: Why?", "Michelle: I would mess everything up.", "Danny: What are you talking about? You are great at helping people.", "Michelle: Yeah, sure. Like I helped you, I helped my dad. I helped marah. I'm helping lot of people now.", "Danny: You've got to stop being hard on yourself. You did what you thought was right.", "Michelle: I did everything wrong. I made all the wrong choices. I failed. I'm the one who let carrie in our lives. You know what? We're lucky to be alive. Of course marah might spent the rest of her life behind bars.", "Danny: That psycho took advantage of you, of all of you.", "Michelle: Yeah she did. And I should have seen it a mile away and I didn'T. I can't help anyone. I can't help myself. I can't help you. I can't help anyone.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: Lizzie, it's me. I got sam's info. I almost got caught. Anyway, just call me back, all right? I'll talk to you later.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: I didn't sleep well last night. I kept thinking about what you said about me reverting to my old self.", "Cassie: I shouldn't have said that.", "Edmund: No, you... you had every right to say it. You have every right to say whatever you're thinking and feeling. May I kiss you? Before the apology?", "Cassie: It better be good. The apology or the kiss?", "Cassie: Both.", "Edmund: I'm sorry, cassie. I'm sorry. Not for being suspicious of jeffrey o'neill, but for not... not having more faith in you.", "Cassie: If you had concerns about jeffrey, why didn't you come to me? Why didn't you talk to me? Instead you went behind my back, edmund.", "Edmund: I know. I know. I know. I just... cassie, I don't expect you to understand this. I just... I've never... I've never been happy just being happy. It never felt right.", "Cassie: You're right. I don't understand that.", "Edmund: I'm always waiting for something to go wrong.", "Cassie: You can't do that. You can't do that.", "Edmund: I told myself that. But old habits, cassie, they hard. And I learned the preemptive strike at a very young age. Get them before they get you or the ones you love.", "Cassie: Don't you see that no one's trying to get me and no one's out to get you.", "Edmund: That's the point, cassie. I don't see.", "Cassie: Edmund, what we have is solid. It's strong.", "Edmund: I want to believe that, cassie. I really do.", "Cassie: No buts, okay? Because there's no threats out there. They're only in here, okay? That's it. I mean, do you really see jeffrey as a threat to us?", "Edmund: I just don't trust the man.", "Cassie: I don't, either. But do you trust me?", "Edmund: Of course I do.", "Cassie: Than that's all that matters. That's it. Okay? Now, don't go behind me back again, please. I do have to admit that I was starting to feel different about the man because of the way he was treating marah you know? I still don't like him.", "Edmund: Well, that makes two of us.", "Cassie: I just wish you hadn't dug up that photo of him and christopher langham.", "Edmund: Oh, right. The photo.", "Cassie: I just have this feeling that jeffrey will not be happy if he knows that that picture is floating around. And I'm afraid about what he might do.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marah: How did you find me?", "Jeffrey: I followed you. I wanted to tell you about the grand jury but....", "Marah: I can't believe this is happening.", "Jeffrey: Marah, there's something else you've got to know.", "Marah: What?", "Jeffrey: Well, they... they did a test on the cape that carrie was wearing the night of the shooting and they determined that the bullet entered from the back. That she was shot in the back.", "Marah: I shot her in the back? I didn'T...", "Jeffrey: There could be a hundred reasons for the trajectory of the bullet. It does not mean that....", "Marah: Jeffrey, do you remember when I confessed and you said that everything would be okay?", "Jeffrey: Yeah.", "Marah: And you took my hand and you asked me if I trust you, right? I still trust you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Reva, do you think that marah even knew she shot carrie in the back?", "Reva: I don't think marah knew anything about what happened that night. Harley, she was on a drug. It was in her system, antimonious. Do you know it?", "Harley: Yeah.", "Reva: You know it's an anesthetic, that it can affect your memory.", "Harley: Marah uses drugs. Are you sure?", "Reva: No, I'm positive.", "Harley: How did she get a hold of antimonious.", "Reva: Carry, who else. She set the whole thing up from the start.", "Harley: So she arranged for the guys to go down to the fairgrounds and josh and billy and ed and my dad and she arranged for the girls to come down there, too.", "Reva: But the girls didn't know that the guys were going to be there.", "Harley: Or vice versa. Something doesn't make sense there.", "Reva: What?", "Harley: Carrie could not have known she and josh were going to struggle for the gun or that marah would be the only girl left in the fun house.", "Reva: I suppose.", "Harley: She couldn't have known marah would pick up my dad's gun.", "Reva: Why choose marah?", "Harley: Maybe she didn'T. Maybe marah wasn't the only one.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: Hi, guys.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Hi, lizzie.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: Oh, is tammy inside?", "Cassie: Yes, but I'd like to talk to you about something.", "Lizzie: Okay.", "Cassie: You're tammy's friend right?", "Lizzie: Her best friend, yes.", "Cassie: Well, you know, then if you like a guy, why don't you handle it yourself and not get tammy into any trouble.", "Lizzie: Oh, okay. I'm sorry, cassie, you're right. I wasn't thinking.", "Cassie: Right. Well, I'm glad you see it my way.", "Lizzie: Oh, I do. By the way, I love your hair.", "Cassie: Thank you.", "Lizzie: Any time. Your mom just yelled at me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: Well, that would be my fault.", "Lizzie: What did you tell her?", "Tammy: She caught me going through her files, so I told her you had a thing for one of the bellmen.", "Lizzie: For the... wow, my grandfather would have a fit. Is he cute? Which one is he?", "Tammy: Do you want this or not?", "Lizzie: You know I want it, tammy?", "Tammy: Why exactly.", "Tammy: Why exactly? Already.", "Lizzie: I told you this already.", "Tammy: Tell me again.", "Lizzie: You trust me, right?", "Tammy: Not exactly.", "Lizzie: Okay. Because I want to give sam a wedding gift for olivia and i can't exactly give it to her in person.", "Tammy: Why not?", "Lizzie: Because last time i did that she left town.", "Tammy: But this gift is your way of making peace, right? It's different.", "Lizzie: Well, this way I can play it safe. Besides, maybe, you know, working things out with olivia might help my dad get better.", "Tammy: Here. Don't make me regret this.", "Lizzie: (Laughs) but this is just a phone number.", "Tammy: That's all there was.", "Lizzie: Well, you know, that's okay. I know exactly what to do.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: You could always just pretend you never saw the photograph and destroy it right now.", "Cassie: I can't do that.", "Edmund: You're going to see him, aren't you?", "Cassie: I have to, edmund.", "Edmund: All right. All right. I'll go with you then.", "Cassie: No. No. You can'T. I think he likes you less than he likes me. I've got to go.", "Edmund: Okay. Whoa. Wait a minute. Why don't you just wait until he comes back here.", "Cassie: No I can't do that either. Because if this involves reva, it can't wait.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: You are great at helping people. You are. Look at how you helped me. I mean, without you, who knows where the hell I'd be. I'd be in jail or dead.", "Michelle: No.", "Danny: It's true. You've turned my life around.", "Michelle: No I haven'T. You're giving me way too much credit.", "Danny: No, I'm not.", "Michelle: Yes, you are.", "Danny: Would you stop it? Just stop argue with me, please. You know, I could wind up as mayor of this town and how do you think that happened? How do you think I've come so far? It's because of you. It is.", "Michelle: No, danny, look. I have screwed everything up.", "Danny: You have not screwed anything up. No, honey. You are an amazing, kind, generous, helpful person. You are. Ever since I've met you, you've inspired me to be a better man. It's just who you are.", "Michelle: Oh, god.", "Danny: It is.", "Michelle: You know what? Maybe that's who I used to be, but not anymore. I just make all the wrong decisions.", "Danny: Come on. That's not true.", "Michelle: I can't do anything right anymore. Really, I can't help anyone.", "Michelle: You've got to stop giving carrie your power. Stop it right now because that cease exactly what she wanted, to destroy you and destroy everything you feel about yourself. You have to stop it. You have too much to give.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marina: Hello?", "Harley: Marina, it's aunt harley. Where are you right now, sweetie?", "Marina: I'm at danny and michelle'S. \u00e7", "Harley: I'm at reva'S. We need you guys to come down here, you and michelle. We need to talk to you.", "Marina: I don't think I can do that. Now is not a good time.", "Harley: You need to come down now. Okay? Marah needs your help.", "Marina: I'll have remy man the lines for a few hours. We'll be right there. Don't worry. Hey, I'm going to take off now.", "Danny: Going over to the hotline?", "Marina: No. That was aunt harley. She said that marah really needs our help. Okay. Well, see 'ya.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: Marina, wait. I'm going to come with you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: If you trust me, then understand that I have become a liability for you, okay? You're going to have to take that trust and give it to ross marler. Okay?", "Marah: Ross can help me. He can help me legally. But you... jeffrey, just being here with you....", "Jeffrey: You know we talked about this. You know I can'T.", "Marah: I know. I know. I'm sorry. I won't make you.", "Jeffrey: Go. Go to ross and let him help you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: Hey.", "Bill: Did you see this, huh? Take a look. You are closing the gap, danny boy.", "Danny: \"Santos showing no shrines of slowing down has pulled within four points of marler according to a wspr journal poll conducted wednesday.\" Well, you know these things.", "Bill: Plus or minus a 4.1 margin of error could be a dead heat.", "Danny: Right. Or I could be trailing by eight points.", "Bill: Optimism. After the fund-raiser, your numbers will shoot up. Shoot up. I guarantee it. Hey, where's michelle?", "Danny: She's out with marina.", "Bill: When she's going to be back?", "Danny: A couple hours, maybe.", "Bill: Rats.", "Danny: Why?", "Bill: No reason. I just... all right, well, i guess we could talk shop until then if you want.", "Danny: We could or you could get off your mind whatever's going on.", "Bill: Well, danny, thanks, i need a woman's perspective on this.", "Danny: You need to talk to michelle?", "Bill: Yeah, yeah, yeah.", "Danny: Everything okay?", "Bill: Yeah. No worries, no worries.", "Danny: Okay. Then let's get down to the campaign. Michelle suggested that I go back to the league... what are you doing?", "Bill: Nothing. Where's michelle? Where'd you say....", "Danny: Bill, just get it off your chest. Please, you're killing me.", "Bill: All right. Yeah. Yeah. Fine maybe I can use your advice. Heck, you do have the experience. Here.", "Danny: I never knew you cared. I think you'd better wait for michelle.", "Bill: Danny, come on, I've been carrying around this thing for days. I don't know what to do with it anymore.", "Danny: Then you are in trouble.", "Bill: How did you do it? How did you ask michelle to marry you?", "Danny: Which time?", "Bill: I'll take any of them, okay? You are the expert.", "Danny: I don't know. First, you've got to wipe that desperate look off your face because that's not going to get you anywhere.", "Bill: All right.", "Danny: I don't know. You just have to find the right time.", "Bill: Okay.", "Danny: Because women think about how it happened for the rest of their lives. Don't ask me why, but they do.", "Bill: So that'S... that's it?", "Danny: Yeah. That'S... that's all you need to know.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: Hi, mr. Morris, it's elizabeth spaulding. Yeah. I've kind of got a problem. Yeah, well, see what happened is I'm supposed to be studying at my friend's house all day and i guess I forget her address and i can't exactly get hold of her, she's not picking up her phone. There's no possible way you could do kind of like a reverse search if I give you the number? Oh, okay. Let's see. The number is 555-8098. Great. Okay. Call me as soon as you get it. Bye.", "Tammy: Did you try to call sam?", "Lizzie: Oh, no, that was the head of security. He's just doing a little favor for me.", "Tammy: What kind of favor?", "Lizzie: Well, since you couldn't get sam's address, he's just doing a little bit of research.", "Tammy: You are unbelievable.", "Edmund: Hello, ladies.", "Lizzie: Oh, hi.", "Tammy: Hey, edmund. You look tired.", "Edmund: Thank you. It's been a long day. Oh, tammy, I was thinking, I was some thoughts about that speech you've been having a problem with. If you have any time, we could run it now.", "Tammy: I'd love some help, yeah. You sure you don't have anything else to do tonight?", "Edmund: Absolutely nothing. I am all yours.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Hey, you guys. We need to talk about what happened the night of the shooting.", "Reva: Marah says that she felt dazed that night, kind of out of it. Did either one of you feel that way?", "Michelle: Yeah. Dazed is actually a really good way of describing it.", "Reva: Both of you?", "Marina: Yeah, it was weird.", "Michelle: I actually didn't start feeling normal again until we went back to the museum, right?", "Marina: Yeah, same here.", "Harley: Did you guys.. you had dinner together. Did you share a drink or something?", "Michelle: No harley, what are you getting at?", "Harley: Marla was drugged. A drug called antimonious.", "Marina: You think all three of us were drugged?", "Michelle: By carrie?", "Harley: That's a strong possibility.", "Michelle: That was the drug she was telling us about, the one they found. The thing is, we didn't see carrie at all that day. I mean, not at least until we went to the fun house.", "Reva: That doesn't mean she didn't see you.", "Harley: Tell me about your day, everything from when you met to when you got to the fairgrounds.", "Michelle: I worked at the hospital from 7:00 to 3:00, then I met robbie and danny at the park across the street afterwards.", "Marina: Shayne and I hung out at the museum. We made tuna fish salad for luh, watched part of \"as the world turns.\" What else... and then what did we do?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marah: Thank you for meeting me, ross.", "Ross: Perhaps you didn't get the memo, but I don't think it's a good idea for you to be traipsing around town.", "Marah: I just needed to get out, have some fresh air and get my mind off of everything for a little while.", "Ross: Any luck?", "Marah: Well, I made the mistake of watching television.", "Ross: Oh.", "Marah: So, what happens now?", "Ross: Well, the assistant district attorney, doris wolfe, she presents evidence to the grand jury and she seeks an indictment.", "Marah: Well, she won't get it right, once I tell my side?", "Ross: You don't get a chance to do that, marah, because you see, the grand jury is pretty much the D.A. Show.", "Marah: I don't get a chance to defend myself?", "Ross: I'm not going to let you do it?", "Marah: Why not?", "Ross: Marah, if you make one mistake, even, if you say one thing wrong we could be in deep trouble. Now, you'll get a chance to defend yourself if this goes to trial, but I don't think it's going to come to that.", "Marah: What if it does?", "Ross: Then we'll have to deal with it then.", "Marah: So you're telling me i can't testify to keep this from going to trial.", "Ross: Technical, yes, you could, I could petition the state, but I'm not a about to let you do it.", "Marah: Why not? If I can convince the grand jury that it was self-defense they won't indict me, then it will all be over.", "Ross: You don't understand, marah.", "Marah: I understand perfectly ross. The grand jury needs to hear the truth, not just doris wolfe's side of the story.", "Ross: Marah, you can'T....", "Marah: I'm sorry, my mind is made up. I want to testify.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: Mr. O'neill?", "Jeffrey: That sounds like mrs. Winslow. It is mrs. Winslow. Always a pleasure.", "Cassie: I need to talk to you.", "Jeffrey: I figured as much since you tracked me down here. By the way, how did you track me down here?", "Cassie: You have your secrets; I have mine.", "Jeffrey: Ooh. Thanks. And what's that supposed to mean?", "Cassie: Well, I'm getting to that.", "Jeffrey: I wish you'd hurry up.", "Cassie: Do you always have to be so difficult? I came here to apologize to you and you can't go ten seconds without being an ass.", "Jeffrey: Apologize, you?", "Cassie: I was to too hard on you with the way you handled marah and josh.", "Jeffrey: Oh, that.", "Cassie: I'm sorry. I was wrong.", "Jeffrey: That's good. Yeah. Well, thank you very much, mrs. Winslow. Now if you don't mind, I'm going to get back to my workout.", "Cassie: Well, there's more.", "Jeffrey: How did I know?", "Cassie: Do you care to explain this?", "Jeffrey: What's to explain?", "Cassie: You were in the service with christopher langham. You trained together.", "Jeffrey: So?", "Cassie: So you're not who you claim to be, and neither is mr. Langham. So, I'm here to find out who you really are.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Roberts: Good afternoon.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Wait a minute. Wait, wait. I know you did the hot air balloon, right?", "Danny: Yeah.", "Bill: And I know you did it just for fun, but was it romantic, too, or....", "Danny: I don't know. It was... it was fun.", "Bill: I don't know. Maybe I should do some sky writing or something. You know? Or go to the beach. Go to the beach have a nice picnic.", "Danny: That sounds great, bill. That sounds great. Whatever you want to do. Can we get back to the campaign, please?", "Bill: Hey, listen. Are you uncomfortable because this whole thing makes you uncomfortable or do you just not like eden?", "Danny: Bill....", "Bill: Danny, seriously.", "Danny: Seriously, I'm not uncomfortable. I'm not.", "Bill: I got you. I'M... I'm going to drop it.", "Danny: I'm happy for you, i am. I wish you and eden all the best.", "Bill: Well, thank you.", "Danny: I do. Look, you'll work out this engagement thing, you will.", "Danny: I better.", "Danny: You will.", "Bill: You want to talk details about this fund-raiser or what?", "Danny: Hey, it was your idea.", "Bill: Well, then let's do something.", "Danny: All right. Just do me a favor.", "Bill: Name it.", "Danny: Don't mention this conversation to... well, anyone. (Laughter)", "Bill: You got it. You got it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: That's it?", "Jeffrey: What do you mean, that's it? That's what?", "Cassie: Mr. O'neill, my sister has opened up her life to christopher langham. She trusts him. If he's lying to her, if you're lying to her...", "Jeffrey: What would I have to lie about?", "Cassie: Well, you have known him for a long time and you haven't told anyone. Why is that?", "Jeffrey: No one ever asked me.", "Cassie: Don't be a jerk. You're hiding something.", "Jeffrey: Mrs. Winslow, chris and I were in the service together. It's not exactly a secret.", "Cassie: No, it's not a secret now.", "Jeffrey: It never was. And reva knows that we knew each other before, that we worked together before. I worked with his friend arthur seacamp on a number of cases in new york. So what?", "Cassie: There's something fishy about this. (Jeffrey laughs) yeah, laugh.", "Jeffrey: All right, come on. All right. Ask me anything you like. What do you want to know?", "Cassie: What's the girl in the picture? The one you're so snuggly with.", "Jeffrey: Well, you know, you're probably going to think the worst of me, but it was a long time ago and I... I don't remember. Sorry.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ross: Marah, do you know in a grand jury you're not allowed to have your attorney present?", "Marah: No.", "Ross: And do you know what doris wolfe would do to you if i weren't in the room.", "Marah: I'm not afraid of her.", "Ross: You should be. Because grand jury testimony can be used against you at trial.", "Marah: I thought you said it wouldn't go to trial.", "Ross: That was before you started talking like a fool. Believe me, doris wolfe will do anything to find an inconsistency in your... let me put it this way: If you testify, there is no doubt you'll go to trial for sure.", "Marah: But I'll be telling the truth.", "Ross: Marah, that simply doesn't matter.", "Marah: I can make then see. Give me a chance.", "Ross: You want me to give you a chance?", "Marah: Yes.", "Ross: All right. Then you should know what you'll be facing.", "Marah: Thank you.", "Ross: I wouldn't be thanking me just yet. Here, sit. Now, then, ms. Lewis, I want to know about the evening that caroline carruthers was shot. She invited you to the fairgrounds?", "Marah: Yes.", "Ross: What were you expecting when you got there?", "Marah: To say good-bye. She was leaving town.", "Ross: That seems like an odd spot to be saying good-bye. Why not say good-bye at the airport, the train depot, the bus stations?", "Marah: Because theym fairgrounds... I don't know.", "Ross: You don't know?", "Marah: No.", "Ross: Sounds like you do. You were about to say something. What were you going to say?", "Marah: Because the fairgrounds hold a special meaning to her.", "Ross: Really? What kind of meaning?", "Marah: Sentimental meaning.", "Ross: And your father also received an invitation to say his farewells to miss carruthers did he not?", "Marah: Yes.", "Ross: And so did buzz cooper. Did you know your father's friend mr. Cooper brought a gun with him? Would you please answer yes or no, the court reporter needs a vocal response.", "Marah: No.", "Ross: Thank you.
