        "Jonathan: It took you long enough.",
        "Lizzie: Are you trying to look scary?",
        "Jonathan: Yes, I'm going to give Ava more hours away from the bar to keep her away from Coop, all right?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, except she quit the job because of you.",
        "Jonathan: Well, I can still keep her away from Coop if I felt like it.",
        "Lizzie: Would you?",
        "Jonathan: Part of a deal with you.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. Um... what would I have to do?",
        "Jonathan: Call Tammy, tell her that you miss her... you haven't seen her in forever, whatever.",
        "Lizzie: You want me to get together with Tammy?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, tonight, somewhere private where no one else will be around.",
        "Lizzie: Why, what are you going to do?",
        "Jonathan: Stop. Just call her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Hey! Oh, sorry. Joey?",
        "Joey: Tammy. Gosh, you're a sight for sore eyes. Look, I'm in town visiting Ma for a couple of days, and, well, you have a seat for me, your first boyfriend?",
        "Tammy: No.",
        "Joey: No, that's cold.",
        "Tammy: What did you expect, a hug? A kiss? Or, oh I know, tears.",
        "Joey: Tammy, why don't you just--",
        "Tammy: Oh, Joey, even though you dumped me for Lizzie and then left town without saying anything, I have been aching for you since the minute you left. How's that?",
        "Joey: Tammy, the only reason why I can tell you now is because he is dead?",
        "Tammy: What are you talking about?",
        "Joey: Phillip Spaulding, Tammy. Look, there was never anything between Lizzie and me, and I never wanted to leave. He just made me.",
        "Tammy: You never told anyone that Phillip was threatening you?",
        "Joey: No, no, no, Tammy. That was part of the deal. I had to keep my mouth quiet, and in exchange, I get to go away to college, and I get a full ride, a scholarship, a chance to play college ball and work on my music.",
        "Tammy: So everyone's happy, except for me.",
        "Joey: No, Tammy. I never forgot about you. And then when I found out that Phillip was dead, the first thing I wanted was to call you, but then I found you had another boyfriend and that you moved on and that you were happy. I mean, you are happy now, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Okay, hurry up. Zip it up please.",
        "Mallet: Honey, this is the fourth dress you put on.",
        "Dinah: So?",
        "Mallet: So they'll be here any minute and-- man-- my fingers are bruised from all of the zippers.",
        "Dinah: I know, I'm sorry. Just pull. Okay, forget all about it. Wait, what are you doing? Nuts? Why are you putting out nuts? My mother's allergic to nuts.",
        "Mallet: Whoa, come here. Hey, it's going to be okay.",
        "Dinah: Look, my mom is coming over tonight and nobody knows that we're living together, and you know, this is our first dinner that you announce that we are solid, and--",
        "Mallet: It's going to be okay.",
        "Dinah: Yeah?",

        "Vanessa: How nice to see you.",
        "Blake: How was your flight?",
        "Vanessa: My flight was fine. Well, how big a night do you think this is for Dinah?",
        "Blake: I don't know, how nervous do you think she is?",
        "Vanessa: Extremely nervous. I mean it's one thing to run a huge corporation; it's quite another to give a dinner party, especially with a new boyfriend. Now, that's a real challenge. ( Dinah laughs )",
        "Blake: Oh, dear. Perhaps we shouldn't even enter.",
        "Vanessa: Oh, no, no, no. I think she needs her mother. ( Knock on the door )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Just on time.",
        "Mallet: Come on in.",
        "Dinah: Welcome to our home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: It's a miracle, isn't it? Life. Here you are being given a second chance to make it all right, maybe avoid all of the mistakes that we've all made as parents. Of course, there is one huge mistake you've got to deal with already.",
        "Beth: Oh, Harley, how did you get in here?",
        "Harley: Alan is the baby's father.",
        "Beth: Get out of here, really. I'm warning you.",
        "Harley: Alan just wants that kid. You're like a glorified incubator.",
        "Beth: You think you're so smart, don't you?",
        "Harley: He tried to divorce you once. What makes you think he's not going to take another shot once the baby's born and then keep that kid all to himself.",
        "Beth: I'm not afraid of Alan, or you.",
        "Harley: Well, you should be. Because I know that Gus was in that cabin. I know it. And it won't be long before I can prove what happened to him and Alan will go down for it. And you better avoid going down for it, too, Beth. Because those maternity wards, they're not state of the art in the state prison.",
        "Beth: Oh, Harley, Harley, Harley, if you only knew.",
        "Harley: My God, you are awfully smug.",
        "Beth: I'm just happy. I've got my child and my husband.",
        "Harley: What about my husband? Beth, please, tell me what happened. I promise you, Alan doesn't even have to know where it came from. Just tell me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Hold on, Alan.",
        "Alan: Rick, I can't talk; I need to get back into Beth. We just saw the next Spaulding heir on the sonogram monitor, it was--",
        "Rick: I know. I know that's all very exciting, Alan, and that's exactly what I wanted to talk to you about. You see Beth isn't just the supplier of the next in line in the Spaulding food change. She's a very dear friend of mine, Alan, so I'm basically giving you a warning: Don't do anything to her that might her or upset her, or you'll have to answer to me. Do understand that, Alan? Am I speaking so enough?",
        "Alan: A touching reminder. Let me tell you something: While I was away, I learned a few lessons. And one of them is I want a loving relationship, a normal marriage, a healthy and happy child. I want the whole ten yards.",
        "Rick: It's nine yards, Shakespeare, it's nine yards.",
        "Alan: Well, I've always wanted a little extra.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: For God sake, Beth, wake up. How many more Spaulding men have to walk all over you before you stand up for yourself and your family?",
        "Beth: Nobody walks all over me, Harley, including you. You see, for once in my life I'm holding all of the cards. I have what each of you wants. I'm carrying a Spaulding heir and I know the truth about Gus.",
        "Harley: Tell me. Please, tell me what happened.",
        "Beth: Harley, Gus... is gone.",
        "Harley: Okay, but what does that mean? Is he-- does that mean he's dead or is he alive?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Hi. Oh, well, come on in. Dinner is on its way. I have some snacky things her for you guys. And-- no nuts. I told Mallet, no nuts for mom. Didn't I?",
        "Mallet: Yes, you did. Yes she did.",
        "Dinah: Yes, and he's a good listener.",
        "Blake: And a very good sport for having your party in his room.",
        "Mallet: Well, actually it's our room now?",
        "Vanessa: What?",
        "Dinah: Um... well, I was going to wait to make this announcement until everybody got here, but what the hell. This is not just about dinner; this is about a coming out party, really for the two of us. We're living together.",
        "Vanessa: Oh. Oh, well. ( Laughter ) This is wonderful. This is wonderful. Congratulations, sweetheart.",
        "Blake: You know, I wish Ross were here to see you so up, Dinah. Good news he is coming home next week.",
        "Dinah: Oh, good. Good, see, that will give us another excuse to have another party. Good. Let me get it, let me get it. Hey, glad you found us.",

        "Dinah: Hi.",
        "Mallet: Hi, thanks for coming.",
        "Frank: What, are you kidding me? I wouldn't have missed it for the world. My best friend here and Dinah, this is all good. I just appreciate what you and Mallet have done for Harley in the last couple of months, so um... hey, speaking of-- is she coming?",
        "Mallet: No. She said she needs some time by herself. ( Knock on the door ) Oh, let me get that, that will be dinner. Excuse me.",
        "Dinah: Oh, good. Mama, how are you? You okay?",
        "Vanessa: I'm great, how are you?",
        "Dinah: Good. I feel good. Are you happy for me.",
        "Vanessa: Very happy for you. Very. Also just a little concerned. I mean, you want this to work out so much.",
        "Dinah: I love the guy.",
        "Vanessa: I can see that. But, you know, take it easy. Don't expect everything to be 100% romance 100% of the time. Otherwise, you'll set yourself up for a fall and you'll get really disap--",
        "Dinah: Fall apart and go crazy.",
        "Vanessa: That's not what I'm saying. I'm just... I'm just your mother and mothers worry. It's part of the franchise.",
        "Dinah: I know. And I know all about reality. I deal with it every day at work.",
        "Vanessa: Yes, you do. And you do a beautiful job. And you know that the best policy is to remain balanced and centered.",
        "Dinah: Yes and to surround myself with people I can count on. You know, I finally found a guy, Mom, that I can trust and count on and depend on, even when I can't depend on myself, most of the time. And I tell you, I think I have found a one in a million kind of guy, and he's mine.",

        "Joey: Tammy, what's wrong?",
        "Tammy: I wish I had known what was going on. Then maybe I wouldn't have made the biggest mistake of my life.",
        "Joey: Whoa. You just told me that everything was great.",
        "Tammy: Maybe I didn't mean it.",
        "Joey: So you don't have some amazing thing going on with some new guy.",
        "Tammy: I thought I did, but I was wrong. It was wrong. It was wrong from the minute I met him.",
        "Joey: Tammy that's--",
        "Tammy: Oh, you know, you don't need to hear my sob story. Sorry. I'm sorry to hear that Phillip put you and your mom through hell. I'm glad everything worked out okay. Good luck with everything, Joey.",
        "Joey: Tammy. You were my Juliet once, remember? Let me be your Romeo again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I didn't say that I was going to call her. I'm still thinking about it.",

        "Tammy: Lizzie, this really isn't the best time.",
        "Lizzie: Why, what's going on?",
        "Tammy: I'm at Company, just dealing with stuff. Sorry, I'll talk to you later.",

        "Lizzie: She's busy with something at Company.",
        "Jonathan: Well, let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: Hey, sounds like you had a rough year. Maybe an old friend is what you need, you know. Someone you could talk to, you could trust? It might help.",
        "Tammy: Maybe you're right.",
        "Joey: We can go someplace, talk.",
        "Tammy: Joey Lupo, are you asking me out on a date?",
        "Joey: If that's what you want to call it, yes. Would it be so bad?",
        "Tammy: No.",
        "Joey: No. ( Laughter ) Towers still the place to go? Gosh, we had so many good memories there, didn't we?",
        "Tammy: It seems like so long ago.",

        "Olivia: No, thank you.",
        "Vanessa: Everything was perfect, delicious.",
        "Dinah: Good. Mallet and I planned the menu together.",
        "Mallet: Yes we did, meaning I picked something out like corn dogs and she would reject it.",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs )",
        "Olivia: Oh, I love corn dogs. Would you hold this? I just want another glass of wine.",
        "Frank: Oh, sure.",
        "Olivia: Thank you so much.",
        "Dinah: Here you go.",
        "Olivia: Thank you.",
        "Dinah: I tell you, Olivia, I was very sorry you and my brother didn't work out, but I can tell you how happy I am that you found a guy like Frank. I think he's the best.",
        "Olivia: I just want someone that's happy with his life and happy with himself, and wants to put Emma and me first.",
        "Dinah: Oh, that's great. Frank is the guy? Good. Good. It sounds like the two of us finally found the right kind of guy.",
        "Mallet: Here, Blake, let me get that for you.",
        "Blake: So tall and so well-trained.",
        "Mallet: ( Laughs ) Don't get too worked up. I'm just going to throw them out the window. You got them?",

        "Dinah: Okay.",
        "Mallet: Oh, maybe I should-- oh, you know what, I forgot something.",
        "Dinah: ( Gasps ) The cheese course. We didn't do the cheese course.",
        "Mallet: No, no, something much more important than that. I forgot to tell you how incredible you look today in that dress. If you hadn't tried on the other four beforehand, I never would have known what a total knockout you are.",
        "Dinah: Oh. Are we doing great?",
        "Mallet: We are doing so good.",

        "Mallet: In what way?",
        "Dinah: Well, I mean, you know, us as a couple, you know. I mean, our future and me talking about that?",

        "Harley: Okay.",

        "Harley: I think actually, I'd rather just go home.",

        "Mallet: Would you tell me what you-- Harley. Oh, man. ( Sighs )",
        "Dinah: Hey, everything okay?",
        "Mallet: Um, I'm not sure.",
        "Dinah: Okay, I'm gonna get the dessert ready.",
        "Mallet: Hey, babe.",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Mallet: I hate to do this, I really hate to do this, but I've got to go.",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Mallet: I've got to go. It's an emergency.",
        "Dinah: What are you talking about?",
        "Mallet: Listen, I'm sorry. I think Harley could be in big trouble.",
        "Dinah: It was her. You know what, tell Frank, he'll be able to help you out.",
        "Mallet: I can't-- I can't tell Frank. There is something going on.",
        "Dinah: Mallet, don't do this. Don't do this. You even said yourself that Harley needed a few days by herself.",
        "Mallet: I know I said that, but she is still my partner.",
        "Dinah: I'm your partner, too, unless I was wrong about that.",
        "Mallet: No, you weren't wrong about that. You are my partner. Listen, I know I'm letting you down; I'm sorry. And I know the timing sucks, but there is something I've got to do.",
        "Frank: Hey, kids, is everything okay? Is something wrong, or...?",
        "Mallet: No. That was one of my contacts on the phone, and I think he might be in over his head, so I've kind of got to go and I've got to check it out.",
        "Frank: Oh, all right.",
        "Mallet: Um, I'm sorry, everyone, I've got to go.",
        "Dinah: Um, dessert. Who wants dessert?",
        "Jonathan: What are you doing holding this guy's hand?",
        "Tammy: I don't want to do this right now.",
        "Jonathan: Too bad. You trying to prove a point?",
        "Tammy: I didn't know you were going to be here. I certainly didn't know that Joey was in town?",
        "Jonathan: Then what are you doing holding his hand?",
        "Tammy: I can do what I want.",
        "Jonathan: You don't want to be with me; you want to be with me.",
        "Tammy: People want a lot of things, Jonathan, things that are bad for them. Things that ruin their lives.",
        "Jonathan: No, what we have is good and strong and real.",
        "Tammy: It's not.",
        "Jonathan: We love each other, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: But why does this have to hurt so much? I just keep thinking there's got to be another way.",
        "Jonathan: To do what?",
        "Tammy: To love somebody. You know, shouldn't you be able to have all of the good parts and not have it rip you to shreds.",
        "Jonathan: You know who you sound like? You. Before you married Sandy, you have this idea in your head of what your future was supposed to be. You had this cotton candy dream that you made for yourself when you were a little girl. You tried to make yourself believe you didn't love me. It didn't work then; it's not going to work now. You've come too far. We've come too far. There's not a damn way you can tell me you don't want me to grab you and take you out of here right now.",
        "Joey: I've got to go.",
        "Lizzie: Joey? That is you, I can't believe it. It is so good to see you. You're still mad at me. I'm sorry, I was really horrible to you. I was an immature, jealous idiot and I'm sure that I probably can never make it up to you, but I would really like to try if you'll let me.",
        "Joey: No thanks, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Come on, Joey, I've really changed since all of that. I'm such a better person now.",

        "Frank: Oh, hey, I've got some right here for you.",
        "Dinah: He's a good one for you, Olivia, one of the few, maybe the only one left.",
        "Frank: Come on.",
        "Dinah: What's wrong with these napkins? They don't fold.",
        "Frank: You know what, let me help you with that.",
        "Vanessa: You know what, it's getting late. I think we should all think about heading home.",
        "Dinah: No one's going anywhere. Sit, sit.",
        "Frank: Okay.",
        "Dinah: We've got dessert. And it's amazing; it's creme brule. Mallet and I decided it would be the best for us. And it's delicious, it was his choice, actually.",
        "Blake: Can I help you with that?",
        "Dinah: No. It's fine. Can't have the creme brule with the brule, right? I love coffee with it. Here, let me go ahead...",
        "Blake: Oh, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: I love coffee. Oh, sorry. It's amazing with dessert. It's amazing. I love it.",
        "Blake: You know what, Dinah, I really did tell my sitter I would be home about an hour ago.",
        "Olivia: And Frank, you said something about a stakeout you had to supervise.",
        "Frank: Yes, that's true.",
        "Olivia: I'm sorry.",
        "Dinah: No problem if you have to go, go.",
        "Frank: The party was great.",
        "Blake: Okay, we'll do it again when Ross comes back.",
        "Frank: Good night. Thank you.",
        "Olivia: Good night.",
        "Vanessa: Sweetheart, why don't you give me that, um--",
        "Dinah: You don't have a sitter or like a stakeout to go to? Mom, I'm fine, okay I'm fine. Mallet will come back through that door and everything's fine.",

        "Alan: Well, did you send her away?",
        "Rick: Yes, Alan. She's gone. She left after she made a phone call. And speaking of phone calls, I found this in the waiting room and I thought it might be yours.",
        "Alan: My cell phone. In the waiting room?",
        "Beth: What is it, Alan? What's wrong?",
        "Alan: Harley was in the waiting room with my cell phone, and I was expecting a phone call about Gus.",
        "Beth: And you think that Harley got the call?",
        "Alan: I don't know for certain.",
        "Beth: But then why else would she leave so fast?",
        "Alan: Look, something has come up. Harley may be on her way over there and I want her stopped at all costs. Do you understand?",

        "Guard: This is private property.",
        "Harley: I have reason to believe someone is being held against their will here. His name is Gus Aitoro",
        "Guard: There's nobody here by that name.",
        "Harley: Why don't I take a look and see for myself.",
        "Guard: Always happy to assist an officer of the law.",

        "Joey: Lizzie, I don't want anything to do with you or your family, okay?",
        "Lizzie: Oh. Okay. Okay. I hope some day you can forgive me. Good-bye, Joey. ( Cell phone rings ) Joey is calling me. I guess he isn't so mad after all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: You feel this? This pull between us, this spark. It's because I own you and you own me. Isn't that what we said to each other in the hotel room the other night.",
        "Tammy: The other night Sandy died? When he went over that edge, he took a part of me with him. And when I found out you messed with his divorce from Ava, that took a chunk out of me, too. You know if I keep hanging around with you, there's going to be none of me left.",
        "Jonathan: I'm the guy that makes you whole.",
        "Tammy: Not anymore, Jonathan. There has got to be another way to love somebody. I need to find out what that is. Um, you know what, I'm hungry after all. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vanessa: Sweetie, why don't you let me help you with that.",
        "Dinah: No, Mom, I'm fine. I can stack and do this all myself, okay. I want to clean up and get into something more comfortable. When Mallet gets home we can chill and relax, which I know he will.",
        "Vanessa: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Look at me. Good, that's exactly what I was talking about when I said don't let your romantic expectations get so high.",
        "Dinah: Mom, you don't think he is going to come walking through that door again?",
        "Vanessa: Of course he is. Of course. It's just that... well, but you have a right to admit you're a little upset, angry.",
        "Dinah: I'm fine!",
        "Vanessa: Dinah, I like Detective Mallet, you know I do. But this was an important night for you, and he was wrong--",
        "Dinah: Mom, Mom! Mom! I understand that. I got miffed, okay. He's a detective, he has responsibilities. I have responsibilities as a CEO. I understand that. I respect his dignity and his responsibility that he has.",
        "Vanessa: Gosh, you sound like a uh... I don't know, an employer getting ready to fire someone.",
        "Dinah: Would you stop? Stop. We are adults. We got into this. We know what we expect from one another. That's the way we walked into it; that's the way we want it. So, please, just go home to the hotel and take a bath, relax, and we'll talk about it in the morning, okay?",
        "Vanessa: Come here.",
        "Dinah: Thank you. Thank you so much for being here tonight. I appreciate it, it meant a lot to me.",

        "Beth: But if Harley gets in there and finds out what happened to Gus...",
        "Alan: If Harley gets in there, she will be trespassing on private property, and she is in there at her own risk. And, trust me, Harley will be taken care of.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Okay, look. Look, I just want to see my husband. Gus Aitoro is my husband. And you must know something or you wouldn't be sticking that gun in my ribs.",
