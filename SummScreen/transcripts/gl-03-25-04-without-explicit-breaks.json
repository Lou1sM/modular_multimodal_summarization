        "The missing rings cause Marina, Michelle, Reva and Harley to wonder if Carrie might still be alive. They hurry to Carrie's room where Marah meets them. There is no sign of Carrie, but she's left them a surprise, a gift left for \"her murderer.\" The women are very unsettled and Harley vows to get to the bottom of the mystery. Jeffrey summons Christopher to commence damage control. Cassie knows they are feds, and Reva will soon know too. Christopher must cut her off at the pass. When Reva returns home, she finds Christopher waiting for her with a confession. Jeffrey meets with Ross, who fills him in on the incriminating photos of him and Marah. Ross believes that Jeffrey is Marah's weak spot and could cost her if they get to trial. Election Day is growing closer and Danny is gaining on Ross. Ross suffers a minor setback when Ed informs him that he's joining Danny's campaign. Danny meanwhile is less than pleased when Salerno shows up at his fundraiser. Bill finally pops the question and asks Eden to marry him. An emotional Eden accepts, but Salerno's presence makes her fear for Bill's safety."

        "Eden: Thank you for coming.\u00f1 Hi. Thank you.",
        "Bill: Big night for us.",
        "Danny: How much do you think we're going to raise?",
        "Bill: More than we have. Election's coming up.",
        "Danny: Ross is ahead by at least eight points.",
        "Bill: Danny, that's going to change. Your points are going up. After tonight, by the time the next polls come out, you'll be dead even.",
        "Danny: Is this hard data talk or just wishful thinking?",
        "Bill: No, that's my gut. That's my gut. Now, get in there and make people believe, okay?",
        "Danny: Wait a second. What's going on with you? Are you still carrying that ring around?",
        "Bill: It's in my pocket.",
        "Danny: A lot of good it's going to do you there.",
        "Bill: Just waiting for that perfect moment.",
        "Danny: Okay. The perfect moment comes when she says yes, so go for it.",
        "Bill: (Sighs) ladies and gentlemen, the next mayor of springfield, danny santos. (Applause) Santos!",
        "Salerno: Looks like you found yourself a nice boy. I wonder if he knows what kind of girl he found.",
        "Lizzie: What, not even a message machine? You're never there, olivia, are you? How are we supposed to bond if i can't even track you down?",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie winslow is not an idiot. She knows we went to quantigo together, so it's just a matter of time before she suspects we were in the agency.",
        "Christopher: Dammit, I hate this. Reva and I are so close. If she finds out I've been lying it's over.",
        "Jeffrey: If she finds out.",
        "Christopher: I know. So how do we contain the fallout?",
        "Jeffrey: We plan for the worst.",
        "Michelle: The rings are gone.",
        "Reva: Are you sure there were there?",
        "Michelle: Absolutely.",
        "Harley: There was a lot of confusion the night of the shooting. You guys were drugged.",
        "Michelle: They were just there. I just checked them. Someone must have taken them out.",
        "Marina: Did anyone else know where they were hidden?",
        "Michelle: Of course not. Whoever took them had to have been watching me.",
        "Marina: Carrie. She was always watching.",
        "Reva: Carrie is the only one who would know about the rings and who would want to steal them.",
        "Michelle: But she's dead.",
        "Harley: Yeah. At least she's supposed to be.",
        "Marina: Carrie might be alive, sneaking around. I don't even want to think what she might have planned for us.",
        "Harley: Let's keep the walking dead talk to a minimum, okay? Michelle, when is the last time you remember seeing those rings?",
        "Reva: Can I see it?",
        "Harley: No, no, no. Please let me get it. Because if carrie touched it, i can get some prints off it.",
        "Marina: This cannot be happening.",
        "Michelle: Carrie cannot be alive.",
        "Harley: Nobody saw how badly injured she was.",
        "Marina: But if carrie's alive, then marah didn't shoot her.",
        "Reva: If carrie's alive, she's going to want revenge.",
        "Harley: You guys spent time with her. You must know her habits. Did she mention where she lived?",
        "Marina: We've been there.",
        "Michelle: We can take you there.",
        "Harley: Okay, yeah. Let me bag this. Help me and then we'll head over there.",
        "Marina: We should call marah and have her meet us there.",
        "Michelle: Reva wants to keep marah out of this.",
        "Marina: I promised marah that I would let her know what's going on. She deserves to know. If carrie's alive, marah's off the hook, right?",
        "Michelle: Or in danger.",
        "Jeffrey: We need to concentrate on damage control.",
        "Christopher: We're playing with people's lives here, jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: That's what we do, isn't it? You can cloak yourself in your ph.D. And all your good intentions. At the end of the day, you and i are in the same business. Don't forget it.",
        "Christopher: All I'm saying is that we've pulled some pretty sensitive strings here. This case was supposed to be just another job for both of us. Is that the way it's turned out for you?",
        "Jeffrey: Of course not.",
        "Christopher: Not for me, either.",
        "Jeffrey: Because of reva? We haven't had one like this in a long time.",
        "Christopher: Not since... you said that on the phone that cassie had seen rebecca's photo. What did you say about her?",
        "Jeffrey: I told her I didn't remember her. I wish that was the truth.",
        "Ross: Have a good evening.",
        "Lizzie: Hi, uncle ross.",
        "Ross: Lizzie, hi. How are you doing? It's getting dark for you to be out here alone, isn't it?",
        "Lizzie: Don't you recognize my car over there? Bruno waits for me while I run. Besides, there's still lots of people out here. So how's blake? I haven't seen her in a long time.",
        "Ross: She's fine, thank you. She's amazingly busy. You know, I saw your father not too long ago and he seemed a little better.",
        "Lizzie: You know, I was thinking the same thing but my mom just keeps telling me to be patient and not get my hopes up.",
        "Ross: Lizzie, never forget, hope is a good thing.",
        "Lizzie: So are you excited about this election?",
        "Ross: Actually, yes, I am. Very.",
        "Lizzie: I happen to know my mom and aunt alex are going to be voting for you.",
        "Ross: Good.",
        "Lizzie: I'm not too sure about grandpa, though. Can I have one?",
        "Ross: Absolutely not. You have to take two. Well, hello, friend, how are you?",
        "Ed: Hi, lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Hi, dr. Bauer. Do you have one of these?",
        "Ed: No, I don'T.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, well, you know what? I'd better go. I don't want to abuse my privileges. Great seeing you guys and tell everyone I said hi.",
        "Ross: Bye.",
        "Ed: She's quite the grown-up.",
        "Ross: Yes. She's a bit of a handful, but she seemed to have calm down lately. Where have you been? You haven't been returning my calls and I know you've had a tough time of it, but I didn't want you to forget that I'm always available.",
        "Ed: No, I know that. So we'd better talk about this for a bit. I have been reading the occasional newspaper and keeping my eye on the campaign and i want to tell you, you were born to do this.",
        "Ross: I hope the rest of springfield agrees with you.",
        "Ed: They will. But I've got to tell you something now, and I hope that you'll understand.",
        "Ross: Well, why don't you tell me over dinner at my place? We can talk there.",
        "Ed: See, I let michelle down and it could have cost her her life. So, buddy, I've got to make it up to her. I haven't been a good father. I haven't been a good father-in- law. Do you understand?",
        "Ross: Yeah. You can't support me. That's okay. I do understand. I mean, michelle is your daughter, you feel fortunate to have your family back, and you want to support them and part of that family is danny. So I guess my campaign will have to trudge on without you.",
        "Ed: Thank you for understanding, buddy.",
        "Ross: Oh, I do. Once I get you back on the racquetball court, you'll find out how understanding I can be. (Laughter)",
        "Eden: Leave me alone, vinnie. I have nothing to say to you.",
        "Salerno: Eden, I just want you to be happy, that's all.",
        "Eden: I'm happy with bill.",
        "Salerno: Then it would be a shame if something ever happened to him.",
        "Bill: Hey, you look beautiful.",
        "Eden: Can we go outside for a minute?",
        "Bill: Election day is just around the corner. And you... you have been through it all with me. I am just feeling hopeful. Yeah, that's right. I'm feeling hopeful these days.",
        "Eden: You're cute when you're hopeful.",
        "Bill: Well, thank you. I mean, that is a good thing, right?",
        "Eden: Yeah, of course it is.",
        "Bill: Good.",
        "Eden: But I'm sensing something mixed up with the hope. I mean, you're kind of nervous.",
        "Bill: Me, nervous? Come on.",
        "Salerno: Danny. Nice turnout. I smell money in the air. You may get to be mayor yet. If you make the right people happy.",
        "Salerno: Danny, what's the problem, huh?",
        "Danny: What's the problem? I thought I told you I never want to see your face in this town again.",
        "Salerno: Well, we don't always get what we want. Wait a minute, I take that back. Sometimes we do. The papers say you're doing okay. Down a little bit in the polls but you're coming back, huh? Hey, come on, what are you looking around for? Are you embarrassed by your old friends?",
        "Danny: Vinnie, we were never friends. I never liked working with you, I never cared for you much at all. You're the past, vinnie, a dinosaur who doesn't realize he's already extinct. Now, if you'll excuse me...",
        "Eden: What are you doing?",
        "Bill: I'm taking your hand.",
        "Eden: I see that.",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Eden: Yeah? Honey, what are you doing?",
        "Bill: Listen, eden, I have something I've got to say, okay?",
        "Eden: Okay.",
        "Bill: I am out here with you right now and I am feeling... i am feeling joy. And that's all I can say. Well, it's not all I can say. I mean, there's a hundred different things I can say or a hundred different ways to say one thing.Ok",
        "Eden: That you love me.",
        "Bill: We will get to that, okay, but back to what I'm feeling.",
        "Eden: Joy.",
        "Bill: Yes. Joy, and... and excitement and terror, anxiety. And hope.",
        "Eden: Honey, you're not making any sense, baby.",
        "Bill: I will. I will, okay? Eden...",
        "Eden: What?",
        "Bill: Eden... eden... I... I am the boss of louis construction and I may be managing a successful campaign right now, but there's still one thing missing.",
        "Eden: Oh, my god. You're not!",
        "Bill: I am. All of this, eden, would mean nothing without you. Eden august, would you make me a complete man and do me the honor of becoming my wife?",
        "Christopher: You haven't mentioned rebecca in a long time.",
        "Jeffrey: I don't like to think about her.",
        "Christopher: Lately that must be a little more difficult.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, listen, we don't have time to talk about this right now, okay? What we should be doing is concentrating on damage control, like I said. Now, you got any suggestions?",
        "Christopher: I'd like to salvage whatever work I can with reva.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, then maybe you better get to her before cassie winslow does.",
        "Reva: Marah?",
        "Marah: Hi.",
        "Reva: Hey, honey.",
        "Marina: It's our fault she's here; we called her.",
        "Marah: I asked them to. I have to know what's going on.",
        "Harley: You guys, listen, i am going to go in alone. I'm going in first, you guys stay here. I'll be right back. Come on, it's clear. But you know what? Try not to touch anything. Marah, you don't have to be here.",
        "Marah: That's okay. I want to help.",
        "Reva: Honey, you can help in a lot of other ways.Ddbm",
        "Marah: Mom, I'm fine, okay?",
        "Harley: So, anything?",
        "Marah: Looks the same.",
        "Marina: Yeah, to me, too.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, almost like carrie could just walk in here at any minute.",
        "Reva: I don't think so. It doesn't look like anybody's been here for a while.",
        "Harley: You know what, guys? I want you to look around. Take a good look. See if anything seems out of place, if anything is missing.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, the shrine to maryanne.",
        "Harley: The shrine?",
        "Marina: It was a box of keepsakes, she had it for years. It was practically the center of her life.",
        "Harley: You're sure it's gone?",
        "Michelle: Mm-hmm, she used to keep it over there.",
        "Harley: How big was this box? Was it something she would bring to the fairgrounds, maybe?",
        "Marina: I don't think so. I can't remember.",
        "Michelle: Yeah. I don't think she could have.",
        "Harley: What? What is it? \"To my murderer.\"",
        "Bill: Okay. Now, that means one of two things. That means \"yes, I will be your wife\" or \"one last kiss before i break your heart.\"",
        "Eden: This was never supposed to happen to me. You are the kind of guy other girls get.!U",
        "Bill: Whoa, wait. Wait a minute. What do you mean, \"other girls\"?",
        "Eden: Any girl. Just not me. I don't deserve someone like you, bill.",
        "Bill: Is this a kind way of saying \"no\"? Come on, what do you say, huh? Are you... are you... are you ready to spend the rest of your life with me? I don't mean to scare you, but i have to ask. I mean, you know, the rest of your life is A... it's a long time.",
        "Eden: You're the only guy that ever made me think for the rest of my life.",
        "Bill: Really?",
        "Eden: Really.",
        "Bill: Okay. Okay. So this is it? This is it?",
        "Eden: (Laughs) yeah.",
        "Bill: This is it? This is it?",
        "Eden: This is it.",
        "Bill: Well, you know, you still haven't said it.",
        "Eden: I know. The ring is still in the box.",
        "Bill: Oh, the ring is in the... yes. Yes, we're... I'll change that. Ask me again. I want to hear the words.",
        "Bill: You want to hear it? Will you marry me?",
        "Eden: Oh, god, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I love you.",
        "Danny: Hey....",
        "Ed: Hey.",
        "Danny: I'm surprised to see you here. What'S....",
        "Ed: I thought you might be.",
        "Danny: Well, yeah. Michelle's not here. Do you want me to tell her that you stopped by?",
        "Ed: So what? Are you trying to rush me out? What's going on?",
        "Danny: No, I'm not trying... what if the reporters try to ask you a question?",
        "Ed: Like what? Who am I going to vote for? I guess I'd have to tell them I'm going to back my son-in-law the whole way.",
        "Danny: What? Um... but I thought... hey, this is different. Thank you.",
        "Ed: Well, I'd say you're welcome, but that would make me sound kind of pompous. I think you're going to make a terrific mayor.",
        "Danny: I just thought that you and ross, because you were....",
        "Ed: A man can change his mind.",
        "Danny: He can, but not if he doesn't have to.",
        "Ed: See, I think I do have to. I owe you this. I think you deserve to have your entire family behind you.",
        "Danny: Thank you. This means a lot.",
        "Ed: See, danny, you fight harder than anyone in this world to make my daughter happy and to keep her safe. I used to think that maybe you weren't quite exactly man that I'd imagine for her, but I've come to realize that you are. It's just the package that had me confused for a while. But your actions are very clear. So thank you.",
        "Jeffrey: What are we doing out here? You don't like my office?",
        "Ross: Well, the press and everybody else knows I'm representing marah and even though you've recused yourselfhe from the case and the assistant D.A. Is handling everything, people are still talking about some sort of cover-up so i thought it would be best if we weren't seen together.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. So what am I doing out here, ss?",
        "Ross: I got a call from a friend of mine who is a reporter on one of the newspapers in town and he sent me these. They'll be on the front page tomorrow morning.",
        "Jeffrey: Marah doesn't deserve this, ross.",
        "Ross: What does \"deserve\" to do with it? This gets worse. Marah is insisting that she testify in front of the grand jury.",
        "Jeffrey: That's out of the question and you know it.",
        "Ross: Yes, I do know it. She hasn't let me get my point across. She says if I don't do it, she'll find another lawyer who will. I put her through mock questioning, and I asked her every question that I know the assistant D.A. Will ask her.",
        "Jeffrey: How'd she do?",
        "Ross: If she testifies she'll be indicted and we can all look forward a nice, long trial.",
        "Jeffrey: That bad.",
        "Ross: The minute I attacked your character, she became highly defensive and when she does that, it makes her look bad. Jeffrey, she can't control her emotions where you're concerned. Do you understand what I'm telling you? As far as this case goes, you're poison, and we both know that.",
        "Lizzie: There you are. I've been trying to track you down all day.",
        "Reva: Marah, honey, don'T.",
        "Marah: Mom, I have to know what it says.",
        "Harley: Go slow, are you sure you want to read that, marah?",
        "Marah: \"If you're opening this letter, I know that one of you has killed me. I wonder, was it one of you girls or perhaps one of the men holding this card? Finally bringing to a close the dirty business you started all those years ago. Whoever it is, I congratulate you and I leave you this gift.\"",
        "Harley: Slowly. Marah, slowly.",
        "Marah: It's for me, okay? I'm the one who killed her.",
        "Reva: It's maryanne. It's the woman I keep seeing.",
        "Marah: \"The burden now is on\u00d1i you to remember maryanne for the rest of your life, to suffer as I did. May she never leave your thoughts as she never left mine, not for one minute, not an hour, not a day, never.\"",
        "Harley: She knew one of you would kill her.",
        "Reva: Or she wanted one of them to kill her.",
        "Bill: Oh... what's wrong?",
        "Eden: Nothing. Um... I... you know, it just... it isn't fair. I'm so happy and your family is going through such a rough time.",
        "Bill: Oh, baby, they're not going to blame us for being happy.",
        "Eden: Um, I just... i think we should keep our engagement to ourselves for right now.",
        "Bill: Why?",
        "Eden: Baby, I'm gonna marry you. There's nothing that I want more in my life. I just... I think that we need to be sensitive to what's going on around us and wait and see what happens with marah.",
        "Bill: All right. I mean, it's going to be the hardest secret I've ever kept, but if you think....",
        "Eden: You can do it.",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Eden: Oh, baby, it's so beautiful. I don't know how I'm going to take it off.",
        "Bill: Well, wait a minute, why? You know, why not just... why not enjoy it? Eden, look, I know you're thinking about my family, okay, but I think... I think this will bring a little joy to their lives. Now I'm ready to scream it from the rooftops if you're with me on this, huh?",
        "Eden: No. I think it's the right thing to do. Just for now.",
        "Bill: All right. Wait. Wait a minute. Okay. Now this way you can always wear it close to your heart.",
        "Eden: I don't want to lose you.",
        "Olivia: What are you doing here, lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: I thought we'd be able to work out together. I called the beacon and they said you might be here.",
        "Olivia: Well, I'm just finishing up.",
        "Lizzie: Don't leave on my account. I thought it would be good for us to work out with each other. We have to start somewhere, don't we?",
        "Olivia: Start what?",
        "Lizzie: Forging a new relationship. Face it, we're stuck with each other now. You married my dad and we both want to make him happy, right? So we're going to have to start over. We can take it slow, that's fine. We can even work out together somewhere. I think this is great. Or I can even go over to your place if you want....",
        "Olivia: No, no. No. Let me be perfectly clear. You have got to stay out of my private life. Stay away from my brother, stay away from my house. I have to go.",
        "Lizzie: Um, if you're going to ravenwood then....",
        "Olivia: No, I'm not. I have to go home. It's been a long day.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. Well, I hope you reconsider my offer. It really would be the best thing for everyone. What's up with you, olivia?",
        "Ross: I know that you have been trying to keep your distance from marah and that's good and I'm sure this is a tall order for both of you. But you know that we're talking about more than just a little bad publicity. What we're talking about is her defense of you is bolstering the prosecution's case. Jeffrey, when marah is questioned about you, she doesn't handle it well to say the least. And any suggestion that you used your position as D.A. To help her, that just makes her go ballistic.",
        "Jeffrey: How, ross?",
        "Ross: Whenever she's questioned about you she comes across as hard, tough, combative. And, of course, I need her to come across as sympathetic. You are her weak spot, and this is a legal disaster just waiting to happen and I don't know what to do about it.",
        "Jeffrey: I do. I just hate the thought of it.",
        "Ross: Whatever you have to do, do it.",
        "Michelle: Why would she want one of us to kill her?",
        "Reva: Did you hear the note? It was rage. It was a setup. She wanted to hurt. Hurt josh, hurt marah, anyway she could.",
        "Michelle: If she is still alive, she's probably around here watching.",
        "Reva: Now what?",
        "Harley: Well, if carrie came back here after she was shot, there'd be traces of blood somewhere. I'll go out to the car and get my equipment bag.",
        "Reva: Okay. This room. It's filled with so much anger. Engulfed in misery, revenge. I have to get out of here.",
        "Marina: Fine by me. (Cell phone ringing)",
        "Marah: Hello?",
        "Jeffrey: Hi. Can you get out of there without the press following you?",
        "Marah: Where are you are you?",
        "Jeffrey: I'm in the park, the far north side.",
        "Marah: I can't wait.",
        "Jeffrey: Be careful, okay?",
        "Marah: Are you okay?",
        "Jeffrey: Just get here as soon as you can.",
        "Marah: I will.",
        "Michelle: Dad?",
        "Ed: Hey, honey. How are you doing?",
        "Michelle: I'm surprised to see you here wearing a campaign button.",
        "Ed: Yeah. I've decided to throw my less- than-considerable support to your husband.",
        "Michelle: And what about ross?",
        "Ed: He'll be fine. You all right?",
        "Michelle: Yeah. I'm okay.",
        "Ed: Are you sure?",
        "Michelle: Um... there's something that you need to know. And it's about carrie.",
        "Danny: No, no, no. See, that's just it. Ross marler keeps going on and on about how he's going$to be tough on crime, but the fact is he was a defense attorney. He's made an entire career of getting criminals off.",
        "Reporter: By that definition, danny, would you include yourself?",
        "Danny: That's an interesting question but if you had your facts straight, you would know i played a major part in wiping out organized crime in springfield.",
        "Reporter: You knew where the bodies were buried? (Laughter)",
        "Danny: Are you asking me do i know who the players are? Yes, I do. And that's why I'm the man to elect because I can keep those people out of springfield. Ross likes to keep pounding away and away at the crime issue, but that isn't springfield's main concern. What is? Our children, our schools, and jobs. And more jobs. Marler doesn't seem to get it. It's about the economy, ross. ( Applause) excuse me.",
        "Bill: All right. I'm going to go check on those press packets, all right? I love you.",
        "Eden: I love you more.",
        "Ed: Are you sure about this? I don't want you to jump to any conclusions.",
        "Michelle: Neither do I, dad. But we have to consider the possibility that carrie's still out there. No one found a body. And no one knew where I had hidden those rings.",
        "Ed: I can't stand this. If that woman is still alive....",
        "Michelle: I know. Harley's investigating it and the police are all over it. All we can do is just hope for the best. I'm through letting carrie run my life. I'm going to let the police do their jobs and we'll do ours, which is win this election. And now with you onboard, our chances just went up.",
        "Ed: Yeah, by one vote.",
        "Danny: There she is. Everybody, the future first lady of springfield. My whole night just got a whole hell of a lot better. (Applause)",
        "Eden: Who's it from?",
        "Waiter: There's a note.",
        "Eden: \"Nice ring.\"",
        "Bill: Just in time.",
        "Eden: You know, we're not thirsty, but thanks anyway.",
        "Bill: Hey, never look a gift horse in the mouth.",
        "Eden: Don't take something you might have to pay for later.",
        "Danny: Oh, and I'd like to add one more thing before we call it a night, now that I have my beautiful wife by my side.\u00d1i I'd like to say that we have put the past behind us and we are not looking back because the future holds so much in store for us, and nothing is going to get in our way. Nothing. (Applause)",
        "Harley: Okay, carrie. If you came back here after you were shot, I would find traces of blood. But if you didn't, I'd be finding exactly what I'm finding which is... nothing. \"Vanishing vanquo: Book of illusions.\"",
        "Reva: \"The vanishing vanquo, world's greatest illusionist\"?",
        "Harley: What? Are you getting something about the sign?",
        "Reva: No.",
        "Harley: Carrie, you just might have pulled off the impossible.",
        "Reva: Oh, christopher.",
        "Christopher: Hi.",
        "Reva: You've been lying to me all along, haven't you? You really are psychic, just as psychic as I am, because I was just going to call you. Come on in. I was just at caroline curruther's room trying to pick up on anything that might tell me something about what maryanne's been trying to tell me. But it seems the closer I get that....",
        "Christopher: Reva, I have to stop you for a minute. There's something you need to know.",
        "Reva: What is it?",
        "Christopher: Before you tell me anything more about you or what's going on with your",
        "Christopher: I'm not who you think I am.",
        "Ross: Marah's life is on the line. Whatever you have to do, do it.",
        "Marah (whispering): Jeffrey?",
        "Jeffrey: Marah.",
        "Marah: Hey.",
        "Jeffrey: Hi. Hi.",
        "Marah: You know what holding you is like?",
        "Jeffrey: Marah...",
        "Marah: You're supposed to say \"if it's anything the way I feel marah, it's perfect bliss.\"",
        "Jeffrey: We don't have time for bliss.",
        "Marah: Okay.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm going to say something to you and I'm only going to say it once, so listen. Your life hangs in the balance of so many different things right now, things that have to go just the right way. Okay? It's like a knife edge. One wrong move-- like this relationship....",
        "Marah: Our relationship.",
        "Jeffrey: This thing that we have, whatever you want to call it, marah, okay, it's the wrong place. It's the wrong time. It's the wrong everything. This thing that we have could be a death sentence for you. Do you understand that? I'm not going to have that on my head.",
        "Marah: You're ending it?",
        "Jeffrey: No, I'm not ending it, you are.",
