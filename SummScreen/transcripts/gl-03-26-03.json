Michelle, when we first got married... Well, we didn't even \r\nknow each other's middle name or birthday or favorite color. And then, \r\nfrom that day forward, it was like we were on this roller coaster ride \r\nthat never seemed to stop. Everything that happened to us happened in \r\nthis huge, dramatic way. We never got to make any decisions together, \r\nbecause there were always these outside forces controlling our lives. \r\nAnd I know that was mostly my fault. It felt like we were twisting \r\nourselves into pretzels to try to fit into each other's world. I tried \r\nso hard to become a Bauer.",

And then you started seeing Bill, and I saw you... (Sighs) \r\nI saw you going on these dates with him and having so much fun, and I \r\nwanted us to have that. I wanted us to have that so much, but I thought \r\nit was too late. And then I decided that there was no way in hell that I \r\nwas going to stand by and watch him take you away from me.",

Michelle, I couldn't live \r\nwith myself if you said no to me one more time. Look, if you don't... If \r\nyou want to leave, I'm not going to stop you.
