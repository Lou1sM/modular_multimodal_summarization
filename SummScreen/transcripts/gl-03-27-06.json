        "Harley: Okay, look, look, I just want to see my husband. Gus Aitoro is my husband. And you must know something or you wouldn't be sticking that gun in my ribs. Say something to me. I just want to know if he is here.",
        "Guard: Hey. ( Grunts )",
        "Harley: ( Gasps )",
        "Gus: Long time no see, babe.",
        "Harley: Is it you? Is it really you?",
        "Gus: I've been having the same dream.",
        "Harley: No, no dream. You're here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: What do you mean you don't know if Harley has shown up? Gus is in a safe place, right? Well, then do whatever you have to do to reach the building and get back to me.",
        "Beth: It's falling apart, isn't it? If Harley finds out what happened to Gus, then we...",
        "Alan: We may have trouble.",
        "Alan-Michael: Sorry to hear that. Oh, man, cute kid. So this is my new baby brother or sister, huh? Well, congratulations, the first Spaulding could be born behind bars. How about that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: You are unbelievable! You are unbelievable, Mallet! You said to me that tonight was my night. You said that this is the first day of our lives, and you left me for her! You left me for Harley! I can't believe it! I can't believe you! Why would you do that to me? Oh, my God. Oh, my God, not again, no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Hey.",
        "Mallet: Hey, Marina, how you doing?",
        "Marina: Good, how are you?",
        "Mallet: Listen, have you seen Harley?",
        "Marina: No, but she actually just called me a little while ago.",
        "Mallet: She did? What did she say?",
        "Marina: She had me get an address from a phone number she had. I think she got it off of Alan's cell. Why?",
        "Mallet: You found the address?",
        "Marina: Yeah, it's inside. Is everything okay?",
        "Mallet: I'm not sure, but I'm not taking any chances. Harley's getting backup, whether she needs it or not. Can we go-- can we look for the address?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: I've never stopped believing.",
        "Gus: Me neither.",
        "Harley: Even when everybody said it wasn't possible, I knew.",
        "Gus: I'll tell you something, I nearly kicked the bucket a couple of times there.",
        "Harley: But you didn't. You didn't and you're here.",
        "Gus: Because I had too much to live for.",
        "Harley: Are you hurt? Are you hurt? Are you okay?",
        "Gus: It's just my leg, but it's getting better, actually.",
        "Harley: Baby...",
        "Gus: It's getting better.",
        "Harley: What, what happened?",
        "Gus: It's nothing we should talk about right now; all I want to do is... Listen, I'm sure that you have orders from my father that you feel you have to carry out, right?",
        "Harley: Because he's Alan Spaulding and he's a very powerful man, and I'd be afraid of him if I were you.",
        "Guard: Look, man, I'm just doing my job.",
        "Gus: We respect that.",
        "Harley: Absolutely, we both do.",
        "Gus: We respect that, but what you've got here is a very nasty situation.",
        "Harley: Something that you don't want to be a part of.",
        "Gus: And whatever it is that you think my father would do to you, believe me, it would not compare to what I would do to you, or your family, or your friends, or your dog.",
        "Harley: His dog?",
        "Gus: Yeah, I'm trying to make a point, babe.",
        "Harley: He's a cat person. Are you a cat person?",
        "Guard: Look, would the both of you just shut up! Hands on your head and move!",
        "Gus: So shut up, put hands on your head and move!",
        "Guard: I can't do that.",
        "Harley: Are you married?",
        "Gus: Yeah, are you married, because let me tell you something, this is my wife. And up until two minutes ago, she thought I was dead. Can you imagine that?",
        "Harley: What if your wife thought you were dead?",
        "Gus: She thought I was dead, but I'm not. I made it against all odds and I'm here, right? I'm here. So I promise you, man, that no matter what you think in your head, I am not leaving this building without the woman that I love right next to me, do you understand me? Do you hear me? We're going to do this your way. You ready, babe, on the count of three.",
        "Guard: Look, I said hands on your head!",
        "Gus: One... ( grunts )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Okay, okay, all right. Okay, Mallet, okay. This isn't you. This isn't you, honey. This isn't you. Those people think that you're crazy. People think that you go crazy over men. They think that you can't handle it, but you can handle it. This was just dinner. This was just a dinner. He didn't know what this dinner meant to me. He didn't know. Yes, he did. Yes, he did yes, he did. He knew what this meant to me! ( Sobbing ) He did all of the right things! He did all of the right things and he still left. He knew what his dinner meant to me, he did. And he left me. He left me for her. He didn't want to leave me for her, I know he didn't. Right? Right? Right... ( sobbing )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: I'm sorry, Mallet. I didn't realize what a big deal this address was.",
        "Mallet: You don't remember anything about it?",
        "Marina: No. I was logging so much stuff into my computer. I think um... I remember something about Basin Street.",
        "Mallet: Basin Street. Yeah, but that's like a 15-mile stretch of road.",
        "Marina: What are you doing here, anyway? My dad was just leaving to go to a party that you and Dinah were having. Shouldn't you be there?",
        "Mallet: Yes, I was, and now I'm not.",
        "Marina: You're finding Harley.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, it's fine. Dinah will understand. Once I find her, and know everything's okay, then I will... then Dinah will... it's... ( sighs ) I know, it looks bad. It's all bad. It's just... but Dinah knows my heart's with her, so...",
        "Marina: If you say so. Look, Harley was over at Cedars with Alan, then she took off. So if you want to find Harley, I'd go lean on Alan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: Can we just state the obvious? Get it out in the open, and have a real conversation?",
        "Alan: A real conversation, huh?",
        "Alan-Michael: Well, it's pretty obvious that the two of you did something with Gus, and Harley's on to you.",
        "Beth: Oh, please. Enough with the conspiracy theories.",
        "Alan-Michael: I was worried about a new Spaulding baby replacing me someday, but at the rate you guys are going, the only member of this family who won't be in prison will be me.",
        "Alan: So, alan-Michael, you think you've got me, huh?",
        "Alan-Michael: No. That's the beauty of this whole thing: I don't have to lift a finger. Harley's going to bust you and Beth for whatever it is you did to Gus. And that leaves no one between me and that nice, big, comfy chair.",
        "Alan: Ah, except Dinah and Harley.",
        "Alan-Michael: That's under control.",
        "Alan: Are you sure of that? Because you don't have the company. And it's only a matter of time before you lose Marina, unless we work together.",
        "Alan-Michael: It's a little late for that, Dad.",
        "Alan: I'm the one that brought you back to town.",
        "Alan-Michael: So what?",
        "Alan: I'm sure you brought Marina up on that, haven't you? Oh, well... then what's it going to be, son, are you going to help us or are you going to lose Marina?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: You okay?",
        "Harley: Yeah. He's good.",
        "Gus: All right.",
        "Harley: Do you think he'll be able to get out of there when he wakes up?",
        "Gus: Do we really care?",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Gus: Oh, no, don't throw the gun away. We could use that.",
        "Harley: To what, blast our way out of here, Serpico? Let me look at you. Look at you. I can't imagine what you've been through.",
        "Gus: That's all right. I'm back where I belong, with you.",
        "Harley: I don't care if it hurts, I am not letting go of you this time.",
        "Gus: Promise me. Promise.",
        "Harley: You okay to make a run for it?",
        "Gus: Yeah. With you by my side, I feel like I can fly out of here.",
        "Harley: Let's fly.",
        "Gus: Maybe not fly.",
        "Harley: So maybe not fly.",
        "Harley: Okay, we're going to get you fixed up, get you home. I'll have my dad bring some food. You must be starving.",
        "Gus: Are you kidding me? I'd die for some real food.",
        "Harley: What? What's wrong?",
        "Gus: Alan and Beth.",
        "Harley: Alan and Beth, they're still in here?",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: Let's go in there.",
        "Gus: Come here.",
        "Harley: No, no-- let's--",
        "Gus: Baby, please, don't.",
        "Harley: Talk to them. It's a public place. Let's let them know you're still alive.",
        "Gus: I don't want everybody to know that I'm still alive, okay.",
        "Harley: Okay, what is it? Talk to me, I'm here. What is it?",
        "Gus: I just got you back. I just got you to myself. I can't--- I just can't, okay.",
        "Harley: All right. It's just, hon, there'll be so many people happy to know that you're okay.",
        "Gus: Well, they'll be happy to know I'm okay in a few hours from now, okay? Okay? What, you want to share me with everybody? I'm not ready to be shared right now.",
        "Harley: So, uh, I get to have you all to myself? Hey, listen, that sounds good, but we've got to get your leg checked out.",
        "Gus: Fine. Go rummage up some bandages, and you can fix up my leg and I get to have you to myself. Is that fair?",
        "Harley: That sounds good.",
        "Gus: All right.",
        "Harley: I'll be back.",
        "( Knocking on the door )",
        "Dinah: Be right there!",
        "Alan-Michael: Hey.",
        "Dinah: Hi, Alan-Michael. Wait.",
        "Alan-Michael: Wow. Did I miss the food fight of the century or did a rock band come through here?",
        "Dinah: I had a bit of an accident.",
        "Alan-Michael: With every dish in the room.",
        "Dinah: Well, there was a party here tonight-- a dinner party-- and things got out of hand. People walked around with lamp shades on their heads, diving for apples and fish tanks and all.",
        "Alan-Michael: I don't see a fish tank.",
        "Dinah: So what's up?",
        "Alan-Michael: Where's Mallet?",
        "Dinah: He is out. He is out. He got a call from Harley and he had to leave the party.",
        "Alan-Michael: He ditched you for Harley, huh?",
        "Dinah: He did not ditch me for Harley. He was called out on police business.",
        "Alan-Michael: Involving Harley?",
        "Dinah: Okay, if you don't want to help me clean up, you can leave.",
        "Alan-Michael: You okay?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Mallet and Harley are partners, you know, or were partners, or whatever. I can't really keep track, but I... I'm not the type of person that thinks that he's walking out of my life every time he walks out of the door, you know.",
        "Alan-Michael: Good.",
        "Dinah: So um... I just would like to hurt him. I'd like to hurt her, too, but I'm not going to do that.",
        "Alan-Michael: Well maybe someone needs to help you snap out of it and face reality. I walk in here; the place is trashed. Mallet lit out on you with Harley, leaving you high and dry. Things may not be as innocent as you want to think they are.",
        "Dinah: With Harley and Mallet. What are you talking about?",
        "Alan-Michael: Look, it's really none of my business.",
        "Dinah: No, just... could you say it, please?",
        "Alan-Michael: Dinah, I hate seeing you like this, okay? I just think you should consider all of the angles, all the possibilities. Let me know if I can do anything to help.",
        "Dinah: Help how?",
        "Alan-Michael: Before I tell you, I'm on your side no matter what happens.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Excuse me, Nurse, I'm looking for-- never mind. Spaulding! So, come here, man. Tell me where she is.",
        "Alan: Take your hands off.",
        "Beth: Let him go.",
        "Mallet: Tell me where Harley is now!",
        "Alan: Well, you know, it's very touching to see that you're still going after your damsel in distress, Mallet.",
        "Beth: What is wrong with you? Let him go. You're hurting him.",
        "Mallet: Tell me where she is, now.",
        "Alan: She was here, then she left. That's all I know.",
        "Mallet: No, it's not. Start talking. Start talking! Where's Gus?",
        "Beth: Okay, okay.",
        "Mallet: Where's Gus?!",
        "Beth: That's enough. Leave me alone! I'm pregnant. You lay one hand on me and I will slap a lawsuit on you so fast...",
        "Mallet: You're hiding something-- both of you. Harley knows and I know. She's on to something.",
        "Beth: Harley? Harley is sick. She's obsessed.",
        "Alan: And she's dragging you into her obsession. You're going along with it, too. But it's not going to change the fact that Gus is gone.",
        "Beth: Yes. That's right. And it seems to me we would all be a lot better off if you would just leave him that way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: I didn't think I would ever see this place again.",
        "Harley: Yeah. And take a look at that picture. And here we are.",
        "Gus: Oh, yeah. Here we are.",
        "Harley: Sit down. Sit down, get off that leg.",
        "Gus: Ow. Babe, um... did you ever give up on us?",
        "Harley: Do you want the truth or do you want the movie of the week answer?",
        "Gus: I can only really deal with the truth.",
        "Harley: I gave up.... a thousand times. I, um, gave up in public and I gave up in private, and I gave up in my head, in my heart. But there was a spirit in me that I didn't even know existed. And even though I couldn't be with you physically, even though I couldn't um... touch you, or hear your voice calling me from one of the rooms in this house, your spirit ran through me like blood through my veins, and that was enough.",
        "Gus: Wow. You're the reason that I got through it. You and the boys. That's all I really had to live for, you know. I would rather have been killed than have that taken away from me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rob Bogue, \"Inside The Light.\" I think Mallet's best quality is he'll always try to do the right thing. It doesn't mean he'll succeed, but he'll try. Who's the right woman for Mallet, Dinah or Harley? I don't know, we'll have to see.",
        "Dinah: See Mallet, Wednesday, March 29th, \"Inside The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm sorry I said anything. Both you and Harley are friends of mine.",
        "Dinah: Well you know what, you can forget about that right now. Be more of my friend than hers.",
        "Alan-Michael: That's what makes this so uncomfortable.",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Alan-Michael: Look, you have a great future at Spaulding ahead of you if you want it. If Harley stays out of the big chair, it's a great opportunity for you to show your stuff.",
        "Dinah: Why don't you tell me what you're getting at, Alan-Michael?",
        "Alan-Michael: Mallet and Harley...",
        "Marina: Hello. Hey. I was looking for you. What happened here? Party got a little out of hand, didn't it? Don't tell me you let my dad break into the ouzo.",
        "Dinah: No. Everybody was well-behaved except myself.",
        "Marina: What?",
        "Dinah: Excuse me, I have to go.",
        "Alan-Michael: Dinah, hold on--",
        "Dinah: No, I'm going to go ahead and handle this head on.",
        "Marina: Handle what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: ( Groans )",
        "Harley: Sit down. No, seriously, sit down. Are you going to let me take care of that leg?",
        "Gus: Yeah. Sorry. I'm acting like a guy that just got out of prison doing 20 years. If I'm being rude, I apologize.",
        "Harley: What did Alan do to you? I swear I'll kill him, and Beth, too. How did she even get involved in this. And how do you hurt your leg? Did it happen at the accident?",
        "Gus: Yeah. You're going to see this thing, and it actually hurts just as bad as it looks, so... easy, easy.",
        "Harley: ( Gasps ) Baby.",
        "Gus: Easy. Okay. That actually looks pretty good.",
        "Harley: I'm telling you, I was all over that accident site. The local pd, the F.B.I., we were all there. How did you even get away? There was no obvious trail that we could see.",
        "Gus: Ah-- ah.",
        "Harley: Sorry. I know that ice storm came in and they were convinced you were in the lake. And then I thought so, too, but...",
        "Gus: See, that's why I'm glad I married a stubborn woman.",
        "Harley: Hey, you know the real reason we're here? Because I found that \"G\" that you carved into the base board!",
        "Gus: You did?",
        "Harley: That was so smart.",
        "Gus: Oh, honey.",
        "Harley: And I'll tell you I was all over Alan. I was all over Beth, but they were tough. I couldn't get them to crack.",
        "Gus: I think we're dealing with a different Beth than we're used to.",
        "Harley: Oh, believe me, I noticed that. But I was smart, too, because I stole Alan's phone and I got the phone number and I got the address, and here we are!",
        "Gus: Here we are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: You don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Alan: Why do you insist on holding onto false hope when this is finally your shot with Harley?",
        "Beth: That's right. Why are you letting her hurt herself like this, making her look like a fool and torturing herself?",
        "Alan: Instead of helping her move on?",
        "Mallet: Listen to me. Listen to me. If something has happened to Harley.",
        "Alan: Oh, please, I don't want to hear this again.",
        "Mallet: Shut up! Something's happened to Harley.",
        "Beth: Oh, you know what? Enough! We get it.",
        "Mallet: Harley means as much to me as anyone in my life. And if you take that away, oh, boy, you will suffer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Baby, being locked up like that... you don't have to talk about that now.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: Yeah, you shouldn't talk about that now. The important thing is that you're here. You're here with me. But you know, I do have to call Frank.",
        "Gus: Yeah, go ahead.",
        "Harley: And the boys. ( Laughs ) Oh, the boys, they are going to be so excited. They miss you so much.",
        "Gus: You think they missed me?",
        "Harley: Did they miss you, of course they did.",
        "Gus: Just being through something like that, you know, you just-- you start to doubt things, the basic things even. I thought about you so much, you know and I thought about the boys. I dreamt about you. I just missed everything so much, you know.",
        "Harley: I know. Look, I know.",
        "Gus: It's very strange, you know, what your mind does. It grabs on to the most esoteric little things. The things you would think about-- I would start thinking about the bench outside of Company. And I'm lying down thinking I am freezing, I'm cold, I'm in pain, why don't you think about a fireplace or a cozy little bed or something. But no, I kept thinking about the bench outside of Company because you know, you go to the bench after a long day and you sit down and it's just so nice to sit there and you look through the window, and you see the Cooper family, it's such a beautiful family.",
        "Harley: It's our family.",
        "Gus: And to pass the time, I used to do this little game. And I know this sounds weird, but I would go over your body in my mind, all right. I'd go over it like by inch by inch by inch, and then when I had a lot of time on my hands, I would go over it millimeter by millimeter by millimeter, and I would especially miss this part-- this part of your body. And then you know how some people's ears are attached to their body, and some people have like little floppy earlobes and I know what yours is like, and then I move to the back your neck, and I'd think about that little lock of hair that would get tangled up in a necklace, and you'd say, \"Gus, can you help with this?\" And then I'd pull it too hard, and then you would get angry with me. And then, hey, this is really strange, okay. But I spent about ten days on your toes, that's like a toe a day. And that got me through at least a week-and-a-half, you know. Is that weird? I know it's weird, but... ( sound of a car approaching ) ( sound of car driving away )",
        "Harley: I, um, miss the sound you make in the morning when you drink your coffee.",
        "Gus: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Harley: Not really a slurp, more of gulp. A lot of air.",
        "Gus: I beg your pardon, but I think I have more manners than that.",
        "Harley: I miss you kicking under the covers at night.",
        "Gus: Well that's not true. You should just admit it, you hate that.",
        "Harley: I never said I hated it. Of course I loved it, it reminded me you were there. I miss the life that we had. The life that we have.",
        "Gus: I know. I...",
        "Harley: The life we were having before you-- no, it's not okay. Listen to me. You left me. Don't you get that? You left me all alone. We were supposed to be this something together and then boom, it never happened. Just like the wedding. Just like prison. But only this time you left me! These eyes? These eyes that you love so much, these eyes cried for you until they couldn't cry anymore. And then they did. They cried, a lot more. And these hands? These hands tucked Zach and Jude into bed every night without you there. Without you there to read them a bed time story, or talk to them about their day went. I held your final shirt in my hands until the thing almost fell apart!",
        "Gus: I'm sorry.",
        "Harley: Do you know what it's like to wake up in the morning and just want to crawl back into bed and spend your whole day there, just under the covers. No, your whole life there under the covers. But not at first. Because at first I was too busy having nightmares and I was at the crash site, and I was prying over the door to find your dead body inside. I'd wake up like I was on fire.",
        "Gus: I know how it feels...",
        "Harley: No, you don't. You don't know. You don't know, and I hope you never know what it's like to mourn me. I had to tell my children that you went to heaven, and that you weren't coming back to them. You don't know what it's like to miss you, to go to bed missing you, and to wake up in the morning missing you, and to spend the whole day just missing you. Day after day after day. You don't know what that is like.",
        "Gus: I know exactly what it's like. What are you talking about? I went through the same thing. In my mind, I told myself I was never go to see you again. Look, what I did was stupid. I was stupid, I--",
        "Harley: It wasn't just stupid, Gus. It was selfish! And it made me wonder, you know, it made me wonder. Who do you love, really? Yourself, and that damn family of yours, or me. And it makes me wonder--",
        "Gus: Can't you understand?",
        "Harley: Why do I always come last? And they always come first!",
        "Gus: Can't you understand, I did this because I was terrified of what my father was going to do--",
        "Harley: No, I don't want to hear that because we could have handled that, together you and me, we could've done that. And let me tell you something, it's not Alan that comes between us or hurts us, or separates us, it's you! It's always you!",
        "Gus: That is crap! Okay, that's crap! But you want to put it on me, put it on me, I can take it! I can take it! In fact, I think I paid for it; I was tortured in that cabin, okay?!",
        "Harley: Shut up.",
        "Gus: I'm sorry, I'm just...",
        "Harley: No, shut up, Gus.",
        "Gus: I'm saying that you're right. I'm saying that you're right, okay.",
        "Harley: Shut up.",
        "Gus: What, I'm not allowed to saying anything now? I can't say-- all right, I'll shut up. I'll shut up. What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: So what was up with Dinah? She was looking a little like freaky Dinah again.",
        "Alan-Michael: She didn't seem that bad to me.",
        "Marina: Yeah, right. I ran into Mallet earlier. He seemed pretty concerned about Harley.",
        "Alan-Michael: Why?",
        "Marina: I don't know. I'm guessing your dad probably might know something about that, but my guess with Dinah is she is not so hot on the idea that Mallet is chasing after Harley, since they were supposed to entertain a dinner party tonight.",
        "Alan-Michael: Oh, that's why the place was trashed.",
        "Marina: You know, you really should put two and two together more often.",
        "Alan-Michael: Knock it off.",
        "Marina: You were trying to console her, right?",
        "Alan-Michael: Of course, but I didn't know specifically about what. Enough about that. All I know is that... things are crazy with Alan, and whatever Dinah and Harley are going through, but none of that has anything to do with us. None of that has anything to do with you.",
        "Marina: Of course it does. Everything has something to do with us. That's what happens when you're in a relationship, right?",
        "Alan-Michael: I don't care about anything except what's right here. This is real. What we feel when we're together, that's real. I hope you know that.",
        "Marina: I do. I know. What's wrong?",
        "Alan-Michael: Nothing, why?",
        "Marina: Because I feel like you're trying to tell me something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Look, I'm not going to wait anymore. I want news about Gus.",
        "Beth: And I think that we should go right to the source.",

        "( Cell phone ringing )",
        "Gus: Oh, my. Let the voicemail get it.",
        "Harley: What if it's one of the kids? Or what if it's somebody with information about you?",
        "Gus: All right, go on. ( Cell phone ringing )",
        "Harley: Oh!",
        "Gus: Who is it?",
        "Harley: Um, it's Mallet. Oh. I called him before I came to find you. He's probably freaking out.",
        "Gus: Why?",
        "Harley: I might have implied that there was trouble. I've been a little crazy, you know how I get. And since you've been gone, he's really good about keeping me alive.",
        "Gus: Don't worry about it, just answer it. Just don't tell him you found me.",
        "Harley: Hello.",
        "Mallet: Harley, you all right?",
        "Harley: Yeah, I'm fine.",
        "Mallet: You were right about Alan, he's up to something.",
        "Harley: Mallet, tell me Dinah's with you.",
        "Mallet: No, she's not.",
        "Harley: Mallet.",
        "Mallet: You called me, but you didn't clue me in so much, so I found Marina and she said...",
        "Harley: Mallet, don't worry about me; I'm someplace safe. You should be with Dinah.",
        "Mallet: Dinah is fine. Just tell me that everything's okay, that you're all right.",
        "Harley: I said don't worry.",
        "Mallet: So, listen anyway, Marina gave me a possible address and I-- hello, Harley? Damn it.",
        "Gus: Good. Mallet's had your back since I've been gone?",
        "Harley: Yeah.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: You know, while you were gone I couldn't breathe. It was like there was air in my lungs, but a bulldozer was pushing it down. Now I can finally breathe again.",
        "Gus: Well, that's a good thing. Because that will enable me to take your breath away.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: ( Sobbing ) I'm not going to do this. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do this to myself again. I know better. I know better. You know what-- no. No. I ain't going anywhere. I'm staying in the room with these. You move.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: Everything's uh... it's complicated, Marina.",
        "Marina: Hey, I know. It comes with the territory, Spaulding/Cooper 101, but we knew that, right? None of that matters. All that matters is just you and me, okay. Not what happens in the board room or with your father or with Dinah. Look, I just want to be here, with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Wow, let me guess, a blonde broke in here and took my son. Am I getting warm? This is not good.",
        "Beth: You know something, I'm not worried. I think we can beat this.",
        "Alan: Really? How?",
        "Beth: Well, no one is going to believe you. But, also, no one is going to believe that I was able to pull off what I was able to pull off the past few weeks. You mean poor, soft, victim of life Beth. No. We can beat this, Alan, we can.",
        "Alan: What?",
        "Beth: No, no, no. We have work to do. ( Laughing )",
