        "Marah: Bye. ",

        "Marah: I had to. ",

        "Harley: I can't tell you that. It's police business. You can't interrupt. ",
        "Eden: Come on, you guys can't keep ducking me. Look, this was my idea for you \r\nto go Chicago and find Lucia in the first place. And we're all excited, and then \r\nnothing? Did you guys find out anything? ",
        "Harley: I can't. I can't do this, okay? It's bad enough I told you about his \r\nadoption. That should have been him. ",

        "Harley: No. No, okay? He will take care of it. That's it. ",
        "Eden: Oh, it? Don't you mean me? You know, if he ever did it your way, he \r\nwould never take care of it. ",
        "Harley: That is so not true. Look, he has to handle this himself, okay? He'll \r\ncall you. ",

        "Phillip: Mm-hmm. Because it's going to happen. There's going to be a name \r\nchange, paper work-- the whole deal. ",

        "Reva: It's like what happened at the Country Club. ",
        "Phillip: No, see, this is what I keep trying to tell you. This is what he \r\ndoes. It's all part of the same game. ",

        "Alan: He has no idea what he's in for, separating himself from the family, \r\ntrying to make it on his own. He's not 21 anymore, and it's a hard world out \r\nthere. ",
