        "Mallet arrives back at the suite to find Dinah throwing him out for leaving the dinner party. He tries to reason with her but she is adamant. He goes to get drunk but when a woman hits on him, he starts to think back to his and Harley's time in Florida, he remembers cheating on her with his partner. Running into Harley at the hospital, where she is to get supplies to care for Gus, Harley tells him that she can't be his partner anymore. Mallet goes back to the suite where he tells Dinah that he is not going anywhere. She punches him and he handcuffs her to a chair so she will listen. Dinah wants to know how she knows that Mallet won't cheat on her like he did Harley and he tells her that it already happened and it won't happen again. He tells her that it was because of the grief over losing Gus but tells her he wants to be completely honest with her. Dinah asks how she will know that Harley won't turn to him again and decides she has something that she needs to do. She leaves the suite and Mallet follows in bewilderment."

    "Transcript": [
        "Mallet: Dinah, it's me. Dinah, are you okay? Are you in there? Dinah. Dinah. I'm sorry I left our dinner party early. It was a reflex, you know. It's a cop thing. Like you hear your partner might go off and do something potentially dangerous, and you... is there something burning? Here. Oh, man. Okay, I messed up. Okay, I messed up. Bad call. It was a bad call, okay. But you know how Harley is. I don't need to tell you; you're a friend of hers. I don't need to tell you how stubborn of a woman she is. Right? Gus is dead, she tells me she is not going to go looking for him anymore. And then-- bang-- out of nowhere the phone rings. She tells me she's got proof. She's going to go try to find him; she doesn't need my help. And then... ( dishes cracking and breaking ) ...and then the phone goes dead and I think she's headed to big trouble.",
        "Dinah: And was she?",
        "Mallet: What?",
        "Dinah: Was Harley all right? Was she in any trouble?",
        "Mallet: Yes, she's fine. She's fine. And I'm just glad to be back home here with you. I'm just glad to be here with you. All right, let me help you clean up. What are you doing? What-- whoa, whoa, whoa. What' going on here?",
        "Dinah: These would be your things, yeah. Excuse me.",
        "Mallet: Hold a second! Hold on a second. What--",
        "Dinah: No. I'm sorry, and I don't know why you're so surprised. Did you not get your messages?",
        "Mallet: You left me a message?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. You're the detective, right? Oh, no, no, don't bother. I left you a message that I'm out of here.",
        "Mallet: Wait, are you dumping me?",
        "Dinah: Whoa! Bingo!-- He's catching on.",
        "Mallet: Wait. Wait, wait. Calm down. This is my room. Come on-- no, this--",
        "Dinah: No, sorry.",
        "Mallet: This is our room!",
        "Dinah: This was your room, then it was our room, and now it's my room!",
        "Mallet: No, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: So you can leave now.",
        "Mallet: Don't do this, okay. I'm a cop. There will always be late-night emergencies. It's what I do; it's my job!",
        "Dinah: We're not talking about the damn job right now!",
        "Mallet: Then what are we talking about?",
        "Dinah: You know what we're talking about? We're talking about what we're always thinking about, Mallet, what we're always thinking about. What we actually never talk about: You and Harley.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Good.",
        "Harley: I'm good. Are you good?",
        "Gus: Me, I'm good. I'm good. I'm real good. ( Laughs )",
        "Harley: I just love this, being alone with you. I am not looking forward to having to share you with anybody else again.",
        "Gus: Oh, please. When they find out I'm still kicking, it is going to change everything.",
        "Harley: No. Everybody's going to be so happy you're okay.",
        "Gus: You think so?",
        "Harley: I know so. Not as happy as I am because we are together again. Just you and me, together again.",
        "Gus: And nobody's going to pry us apart.",
        "Harley: Nothing and nobody.",
        "Gus: That's right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: It's you and me, right? We are together, right here, right now, right? I thought we had that much figured out!",
        "Dinah: Do you actually believe that?",
        "Mallet: Yes, I hope so!",
        "Dinah: Well, you know what? I don't. I have tried-- my God!-- Have I tried, but I am through with trying with you.",
        "Mallet: Listen, Dinah, just talk to me, all right?",
        "Dinah: No! I am not talking with you! I don't even want you thinking my name! You know something? I can fill Harley's space just fine-- at the board room and everywhere else, but I cannot fill it here, here, the one place I have been trying!",
        "Mallet: Come here. You are... you are right here, do you hear me?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, why don't you tell me where you are!",
        "Mallet: Right here with you!",
        "Dinah: You are not! You wasn't and I don't believe you!",
        "Mallet: I don't what else I can do to prove myself! Oh, man, I'm the one... the one that who pursued you. I'm the one that kept coming after you, even though you blew me off any number of times. I'm the one who asked you to move in here with me. I want this. I want you.",
        "Dinah: That's just it. It's what you want, but you can't walk the walk.",
        "Mallet: All this is because I left dinner early? ( Sighs )",
        "Dinah: Let me tell you something, this is more than just dinner. This was the start of us! This was the start of our life, our party, our place!",
        "Mallet: Listen, Dinah, this is the start.",
        "Dinah: No, it is not. I don't want to hear it. I'm not Harley! I'm not her, I'm not Cassie, and I have not had anybody special to throw parties with! And I have never had a guy put me number one. You know why? Because he hasn't been there, and I still don't have him here because one word from Harley and you walk out that door constantly.",
        "Mallet: I had a partner in trouble. Do you understand that?",
        "Dinah: Wrong. Wrong. You had a partner right here. You had a partner here who was ready to build a future with you.",
        "Mallet: She's our friend. We've both been doing that, we've been helping her through it, right?",
        "Dinah: No! No. There's a part of you that will always love Harley. Always. And you know something, there may be people out there that would be okay with it, but I'm not. I can't do that. I need all of someone. And if I can't have that, that is less than I deserve. I want all of you. And let me tell you something, I'm not going to settle.",
        "Mallet: I'm not asking you to settle.",
        "Dinah: You know, I want you to shut up. I want you to go find Harley and figure things out, okay. Gus is dead, Harley's free, and now so are you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: How's your leg doing?",
        "Gus: It's fine.",
        "Harley: Yeah?",
        "Gus: I have twinges, you know.",
        "Harley: You sure?",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: Come on, let me take a look at that?",
        "Gus: No, no, no.",
        "Harley: Come on, come on. Get up.",
        "Gus: I just want a little loving.",
        "Harley: Be a big boy.",
        "Gus: Give me some love. I've got some big plans for tonight. I'm not done with you.",
        "Harley: That dressing's been on there a while, it needs to be changed.",
        "Gus: No, no. No, no, no. I'm fine. I'm fine, honestly.",
        "Harley: You're not fine; you're in pain and you know what? I think we need to go to Cedars and have that looked at.",
        "Gus: Oh, no. Stop, I'm not going to any hospitals, okay. The minute it's out in the public, I've to go back into reality and deal with Beth and Alan. No thank you. I'm not... I'm fine. Just give me some love... just give me some love and I'll feel better. Look at me, I'm already better. I'm dancing here; I'm dancing.",
        "Harley: I'll tell you what...",
        "Gus: What? Don't tell me anything. Just show me, okay. Show me the love.",
        "Harley: Listen to me, I am going somewhere and it will work out well for both of us. We'll both get our way. Okay. Trust me.",
        "Gus: What are you talking about?",
        "Harley: I happen to know a doctor who doesn't mind bending the rules for family, if you know what I mean.",
        "Gus: Mmm, I see.",
        "Harley: Be brave, stay here. I'll be right back. Okay.",
        "Gus: All right. Where the hell am I going?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Tequila, top shelf. Save yourself some time and make it two.",
        "Josie: That kind of day, huh? I'm good at helping guys forget about their problems.",
        "Woman: Hello.",
        "Mallet: Hey.",
        "Woman: You sound tense. I'm good at helping guys forget their problems. Let's get together tonight.",
        "Mallet: No, we're not getting together tonight. And we're not doing... we're not doing that again, okay. It's over; it never happened. I'm sorry, but we just have to forget it, okay, because I love my wife. I love my wife. Do you think I look like a cheater?",
        "Josie: Do you have a wife?",
        "Mallet: No. I used to, though.",
        "Josie: What happened?",
        "Mallet: It was the best time of my life and I blew it. What happened--",
        "Frank: Oh, Mallet, finally.",
        "Mallet: Frank, just in time. Belly up, man, it's on me.",
        "Frank: No, I can't, I'm on duty. Listen, I've been trying to track you down. Did you turn off your cell phone? I need you.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, it's late. I'm drinking.",
        "Frank: How many have you put down?",
        "Mallet: This will be the first of many, my friend.",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, don't start because I need you on the job.",
        "Mallet: Great. Nice talking to you. Okay. Hey, Nurse Detrick, how you doing? I finished all the questioning, but do me a favor? Call the department if there's any change in the patient's status, because he's a very important suspect in a very important case.",
        "Nurse: You bet, Detective.",
        "Mallet: Great, thank you.",
        "Nurse: Have a good night.",
        "Mallet: Have a good night. I don't know if there is much chance of--",
        "Harley: Mallet?",
        "Mallet: Well, you really shouldn't have bothered because it's all taken care of.",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Mallet: The perp, just standard questioning, no big surprises. I don't know why Frank had dragged you down here at this hour. Everything's done.",
        "Harley: Oh. Well, yeah. Oh, great. Whew, glad that is taken care of. Thanks for taking care of that.",
        "Mallet: You betcha.",
        "Harley: You okay?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I'm fine. This isn't really what I wanted to do with my night, that's all.",
        "Harley: That makes two of us. I guess Frank owes us one, huh?",
        "Mallet: Yeah. Yeah, Frank owes us one.",
        "Harley: There you go.",
        "Frank: My best friend and my sister. How's married life treating you guys?",
        "Mallet: Good.",
        "Harley: Yeah.",
        "Frank: Good, we'll talk later.",
        "Mallet: That's what friends do, they talk.",
        "Harley: Not about their wives if they know what is good for them.",
        "Frank: The place looks great. Oh, look at these flowers. These beautiful. Did I miss an occasion here?",
        "Mallet: No, it's Wednesday. It's Wednesday.",
        "Frank: Wednesday? Talk about setting the husband bar really high.",
        "Harley: Hey, watch it. I'm putting call to Eleni.",
        "Frank: And then this trip is going to cost you a lot more than you planned. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Harley: Go ahead, get it.",
        "Mallet: That's all right, they'll call back.",
        "Frank: You've got to be kidding me, three --",
        "Mallet: Three dozen.",
        "Frank: Three dozen roses, Wednesday. Okay, what did you do?",
        "Mallet: What?",
        "Frank: What did you do?",
        "Harley: Go ahead, tell your best friend about her.",
        "Frank: Her, what are you talking about?",
        "Harley: Her. I can't fight it. I finally gave up. Don't look at me like that. Tell him about the other woman in your life.",
        "Frank: You know her name?",
        "Harley: Yeah, it's Miss 15th precinct.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, that's her.",
        "Frank: You working a lot of overtime?",
        "Mallet: Yeah.",
        "Frank: Extra hours, extra roses. So, you know what? Where's my room?",
        "Harley: Second door down on the right, and I put fresh towels on the bed and there is fresh shampoo in the bathroom.",
        "Frank: Thank you. You know what, I'm going to just unpack and I'll be right back, okay?",
        "Mallet: All right. All right. Listen...",
        "Harley: Hmm?",
        "Mallet: I've been working a lot, you know, a lot of overtime lately, and I just want you to know that--",
        "Harley: Honey...",
        "Mallet: Listen to me. I promise--",
        "Harley: Honey, stop.",
        "Mallet: I promise I'll make it up to you.",
        "Harley: Stop. I have stuff to do. He's here. It's fine, it's fine. If anybody understands a cop's life, it's me, right? That's one of the reasons you're so lucky to be married to me. You sure you're okay?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I'm great, terrific, fantastic, never been better.",
        "Harley: Okay. Well, since you're obviously in such a good mood, maybe now is the time to get this over with. There's something that I want you to hear from me first, okay?",
        "Mallet: Okay.",
        "Harley: It's about being partners, you know, us being partners. I just can't do it anymore.",
        "Mallet: Okay.",
        "Harley: Believe me, this is the best thing for both of us, really.",
        "Mallet: Okay, fine.",
        "Harley: So you understand, it's just too hard--",
        "Mallet: You know what? I get it; we're done. I get it. We're done.",
        "Harley: Okay. You're sure you're okay?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, sure. Hell, no problem.",
        "Harley: Okay, what's the story? You're freaked out.",
        "Mallet: No, I'm fine. Let me get this straight, you're done with the job, you're hanging up the badge.",
        "Harley: Now you're trying to change the subject. It's just something I feel like I need to do.",
        "Mallet: Okay, that's fine. Just not for me; I never asked for it.",
        "Harley: No, no. No, you have been a great friend to me. Mallet, I don't know how I would have gotten through these last few months without Gus-- without you.",
        "Mallet: You've got a lot of people who care for you in your life, Harley.",
        "Harley: But you'll always be the most important. Because we're connected; that's just the way it is.",
        "Mallet: Yeah. I guess you're stuck with me. I'm sorry.",
        "Harley: Don't be, I'm not. Mallet, take care of yourself, okay? I've got to go, there's something I've got to take care of.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I'm sure I'll see you. Frank.",
        "Frank: You done already? That was quick.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, mission accomplished, man.",
        "Frank: Good job.",
        "Mallet: You want my notes?",
        "Frank: Actually, no. You can just type them up and put them on my desk in the morning.",
        "Mallet: All right, no problem, Chief. By the way, Harley told me the news.",
        "Frank: What news?",
        "Mallet: She's quitting the force. You didn't know that?",
        "Frank: What? Did she say why?",
        "Mallet: No, she didn't say why, Frank, but it is pretty obvious why she's quitting the force. It's me. You know what, I'm not going to let her do it. This is the one thing that has held her together since Gus' disappearance, and she needs the work and something she can put her heart into and she can't do that in Spaulding.",
        "Frank: No argument there.",
        "Mallet: Good. That's why I'm putting in for a transfer. She needs to stay in Springfield; I don't need to stay in Springfield, so... I think it's pretty simple.",
        "Frank: You know, guess what? No, it's not actually. And I'm going to tell you the same thing I'm going to tell her and that is that neither one of you are going anywhere.",
        "Mallet: No, Frank, it's fine. Really, I'm okay. Anyway, I'm out, okay? It's too late.",
        "Frank: What's this all about? Tell your buddy.",
        "Mallet: I just told you, Frank!",
        "Frank: Really? You know what, is this... this is about Dinah, isn't it? Guess what? I saw the look on her face when you left the party to find Harley, and Dinah ended up having a really rough night. Mallet, you can make this work. I know it's very hard to have a cop's life and a relationship. No one knows it better than me, and I know you know that, too. And I also know.... come on, man, you can make this happen. You can make it work this time around.",
        "Mallet: Well, I'm glad you think so, Frank. Regina, listen to me. I meant what I said.",
        "Regina: Who are we hurting? Your wife doesn't even know.",
        "Mallet: That's not the point. That's not the point. I love my wife; I love Harley. You and I got carried away. And that was one time. It's not going to happen again. It's not happening again. Too many hours stuck on stakeouts. Too many hours stuck in this van.",
        "Regina: Stuck?",
        "Mallet: Listen, you're a great girl, you're a great partner, but I am not doing this to my wife, okay? I hate what I've already done.",
        "Regina: Honestly, you know what, forget it.",
        "Mallet: That's all right, Cassie, I'm sorry. Look, if you've got something to say, just can say it.",
        "Cassie: I know that you and Harley got close again, working together and then after Gus died, it only made sense for her to turn to you.",
        "Mallet: Is there a but in all of this?",
        "Cassie: But, I mean, come on, going back again trying to make something work that didn't work the first time. You know that's asking for trouble. And whatever regrets Harley has about telling you to move on and to go with Dinah, I think you're both probably better off in the long wrong. Don't you think?",
        "Mallet: Hold it, Harley said she has regrets?",
        "Cassie: Look, she told me in confidence you had said you would wait for her if she felt that there was a chance, and she said there wasn't and you should move on with Dinah.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, she said that.",
        "Cassie: Mallet, I think it was just too soon after Gus. It's the way things happen sometimes. I think she didn't want to keep you in limbo, but she is regretting cutting you loose. I don't know-- I don't even know why I'm telling you this.",
        "Mallet: Why are you telling me all of this?",
        "Cassie: I don't know, I guess I'm thinking, why have regrets at all. Life is short. They just hold you back.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, they kind of do, don't they? I think you're right on that one. Hey, thanks. Thanks for talking to me.",
        "Cassie: Sure.",
        "Mallet: Thank you. I love you, and if you think--",
        "Harley: I don't think anything, I know what I saw.",
        "Mallet: Well, I'm not going to let you just walk away.",
        "Harley: Let me? You're not let me do anything.",
        "Mallet: Oh, you say that you love me, you say that you love me and that all goes right out the window. There's no talking about it. There's no explanation, huh? You just turn it on; turn it off. That's it, done. Not thinking about anything we've had to go through to get here.",
        "Harley: Stop! Just stop for a second, okay.",
        "Mallet: Oh, baby, don't you remember? Don't you remember? I remember the first time you told me that you loved me.",
        "Harley: I was half frozen, I was delirious. And you saved me?",
        "Mallet: No, you saved me.",
        "Harley: You were a different guy then, Mallet.",
        "Mallet: You were a different girl. My God, what happened to us? What is this? This isn't you? What are you doing? We're playing house. What happened to the good times? What happened to the girl who had that look on her face when I gave her my mother's engagement ring? The look on that girl's face during our wedding. Where is she?",
        "Harley: Our wedding. I never let myself be that happy before.",
        "Mallet: We can be those people again, you know, we can. Come on, I've got faith in us. I've got faith in you. We can do this. Come on. I won't let you go. I can't. Not now, not ever.",
        "Harley: Stop it. Stop it.",
        "Mallet: Come on, trust me. Just give me another chance!",
        "Harley: No, I can't. Why don't you answer my question? You tell me the truth. Did you sleep with her? Yes or no?",
        "Mallet: No, baby, come on.",
        "Harley: You liar! You liar. Don't touch me. Don't say another word. You get out of here.",
        "Mallet: Baby--",
        "Harley: No. I don't want to hear anything. You get out of here. Get out!",
        "Mallet: I should have been honest with her, and I never should have left. Should have faced it. I should have fought. I should have fought for us. I'm ready to fight for you. I want you back.",
        "Dinah: I want you out. Get out.",
        "Mallet: Not this time.",
        "Dinah: Did you hear what I said? You don't belong here anymore.",
        "Mallet: We'll see.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, we are going to see. Mallet, I'm not playing games with you here.",
        "Mallet: No games.",
        "Dinah: That's exactly right. You know what-- no! We are finished, we are through. Mallet! You take your stuff, get all of your crap out of here, and face your obsession with Harley! When I get through with you, pieces of you are going to be in this garbage bag.",
        "Mallet: You're going to sit here, and I'm going to hold you until you wake up and you figure it out.",
        "Dinah: Figure out what?",
        "Mallet: That we belong together. That we're good together, and we make a great couple. It took me a while to know it, but you should know it, too.",
        "Dinah: Okay. I'll give you a truth.",
        "Mallet: Really, just like that?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, just let me up and we'll talk about it, okay. But, come on, just let me go.",
        "Mallet: Okay.",
        "Dinah: Thank you. If you ever touch me again like that, you will be singing like Bjork. Do you understand me?",
        "Mallet: That was a really dirty trick.",
        "Dinah: Yes, get away from me, I told you. Don't even get near me. Ouch, Mallet, what are you doing? You're crazy, what are you doing? Ouch!",
        "Mallet: Okay, just a guy who knows what he wants.",
        "Dinah: You think bringing yourself back in here is going to fix everything?",
        "Mallet: I'm not leaving: Get used to it.",
        "Dinah: What about Harley?",
        "Mallet: It's time to move forward. I'm through looking back.",
        "Dinah: Let me tell you something, you walked through the wrong door. We're through. We both know what you want and that's Harley. And if you ever had a choice, you would always go running back to her anyway.",
        "Mallet: Nope, not this time.",
        "Dinah: So how do I know? How do I know you're not going to cheat on me the way you cheated on her. How can I ever trust you ever again?",
        "Mallet: Because it already happened, that's why.",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Mallet: Because it already happened, that's why. I've already made that mistake. It was a big mistake. I slept with Harley. But I'm here now, Dinah. I choose to be here. I choose to be with you. I want to be with you.",
        "Dinah: When did it happen?",
        "Mallet: After Gus died. It happened once, Dinah. It was the night that it first hit Harley that Gus was gone, gone. And you and I were just getting started. And, um, Harley was just sick with grief, not that that is any kind of an excuse. There's no excuse. But she lost her husband, and I lost a partner. And she needed me. And we knew afterwards it was never going the happen again. Because it wasn't really about us. It was about Gus. It was needing to feel that loss of him, needing to share it, needing comfort from that. It wasn't about love between me and Harley. Because Harley knows that Gus is her one true love, and always will be. And I know that I love you.",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Mallet: You heard me. I said it because that's what I feel? And I'll say it again and again and again. You come first with me and always will, starting right now. So you can yell at me, you can trash everything I own, but it's not going to change one thing that I feel about you because I love you. I love you, Dinah, I love everything about you, and I will take all of you. The wildness, and you're unpredictable. Your hands down the last person I dreamed I'd end up with. And you're hands down the first person I want to call with good news. And you're the person I want by my side when things go wrong. And I want to be that person for you. Will you let me be that person for you? We've had a rough time of it. We've made some mistakes. But I will not make another mistake by losing you.",
        "Dinah: Why did you bother telling me all of this about Harley after I sent you away?",
        "Mallet: I guess I'm taking a risk. I guess I kind of learned that from you. And you know what you're biggest risk was? Trusting me with your heart. After all of those times it has been broken. I'm telling you the truth because I owe you the truth, and you deserve the truth. And you deserve everything a man can give you. And I want to be that man. So if you want to push me away, you can, but it's not going to change about how I feel about you. Not now, not ever.",
        "Dinah: Are you finished?",
        "Mallet: No, not yet. I know who I am. I know what I want. And I know when I see it. So I guess what I'm saying is... I guess what I'm saying is I'm here. I'm in. What about you?",
        "Dinah: You say that Harley is your past.",
        "Mallet: She is.",
        "Dinah: Are you hers? Is she over you?",
        "Mallet: Is she over me?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, it's difficult to know, isn't it? I mean Gus is gone, he is dead, and, um, she's alone, and she turned to you once. How do I not know she'll turn to you again?",
        "Mallet: Dinah, Dinah, where are you going?",
        "Dinah: I need to go do something.",
        "Mallet: Now?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Something unpredictable. Remember, that's what you liked about me.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, but...",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Gus: Hey, how's it hanging?",
        "Beth: I'm doing what's best for my child.",
        "Dinah: Mallet was definitely there for Harley, Gus, more than you know. I'm going to take these beautiful ladies to lunch. Have fun.",
        "Alan: If you want to hang on to that little girlfriend of yours, Gus is your problem, too. ."
