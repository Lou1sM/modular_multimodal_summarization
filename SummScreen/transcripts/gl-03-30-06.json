        "Marina: Hold that thought. I'm going to go fix this girl's bed head.",
        "Alan-Michael: Oh, no, you don't.",
        "Marina: Oh, yes, I do.",
        "( Knock on the door )",
        "Alan-Michael: Yeah, hold on. ( Knocking on door ) Hold on! I hear you're unemployed, but didn't know you had to take a job with room service.",
        "Alan: And I forgot how funny you are, son. I see you have a guest. I wonder who.",
        "Alan-Michael: Say what you have to say and get out, Dad.",
        "Alan: Gus is alive. He's on his way back to Springfield. In fact, he may be back right now.",
        "Alan-Michael: That's your problem, not mine.",
        "Alan: No, son, if you want to hang on to that little girlfriend of yours, Gus is your problem, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Hi. What can I get you?",
        "Beth: I'll have some coffee.",
        "Buzz: You mean decaf? This is your first trimester, right?",
        "Beth: Right. Right, I forgot. I will have tea, then, chamomile.",
        "Buzz: Chamomile, that reduces stress.",
        "Beth: And why would I be stressed?",
        "Buzz: I don't-- you're married to Alan Spaulding and having his baby. I'll get you double.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: \"And the little bunny got a running start and he jumped as high as he could.\"",
        "Frank: And jumped all the way over the stream and landed safely on the other side. I love that story, right, Mom?",
        "Olivia: Yes, it's a great story. That's the end of it, baby. So how is your arm?",
        "Frank: I'm fine. I don't know why I have to wear this stupid thing. Do you know what this is?",
        "Emma: A sling.",
        "Frank: You're right. It is kind of like a little house for my arm because I have a boo-boo here, but I'm feeling much better. I'll tell you what, would you like to sign your name or draw a little picture on my sling?",
        "Olivia: Yeah, go for it.",
        "Frank: There you go.",
        "Olivia: There. You really all right?",
        "Frank: Yeah, I'm fine. Just a little hungry, though. So what are you ladies up to today? You have any big meetings or any major deals going on?",
        "Olivia: No. This is just mommy day. I'm just hanging with my little girl. That's what I do now, I go with the flow.",
        "Frank: Wow.",
        "Olivia: There's a first time for everything; I'm learning.",
        "Frank: Wow. Well, you know what, then? Just give me one second here. This is Chief Cooper. I'm taking a personal day today, so if you need to contact me-- only contact me if it is important. Thanks. So, ladies, how about I buy you some lunch?",
        "Olivia: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: You know, Buzz, you should be careful what you say about my husband.",
        "Buzz: I call them like I see them.",
        "Beth: Well, Alan is exactly what I need right now. He goes after what he wants.",
        "Buzz: I can't argue with that.",
        "Beth: And he's a loving father?",
        "Buzz: Tell that to Phillip and Gus.",
        "Beth: Right. Listen, I know what people are saying about me and about Alan, but I also know what I've gotten into. I've made my choices, and I'm ready to live with them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Dinah. Dinah, come here.",
        "Dinah: What are you doing? What are you doing? Are you following me?",
        "Mallet: What are you doing?",
        "Dinah: I'm here to talk to Harley.",
        "Mallet: Don't.",
        "Dinah: Don't what?",
        "Mallet: Whatever you're going to do here, don't. Let's just turn around.",
        "Dinah: Why, you afraid I'm going to compare notes with the other woman you've been sleeping with?",
        "Mallet: Slept with-- slept with once.",
        "Dinah: Okay.",
        "Mallet: We made a mistake.",
        "Dinah: You know what, good. All right, let's just see if she agrees, okay.",
        "Mallet: No.",
        "Dinah: What are you going to do, Mallet? Are you going to frisk me for some weapons? I think you should.",
        "Mallet: Your problem's with me. Your problem is with me.",
        "Dinah: No, no. Excuse me, no. She was supposed to be my friend. I trusted her. And apparently she sees me as someone as-- I don't know-- as a place holder at Spaulding and in the bed. And I will not be a space holder to anyone anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: I'll just get us some food; I'll be right back.",
        "Gus: All I need is five more minutes, please! That's all I need to hold me over. Hey, how's it hanging? Hey, man, how you doing? It's good to see you. You can hug me, I'm not a ghost. It's all right. I almost was a ghost, though, if it wasn't for my fantastic wife.",
        "Mallet: You're alive!",
        "Gus: You're quick like that. That's why you're a detective.",
        "Mallet: Well, how...",
        "Harley: Last night I got a phone number off of Alan's phone and I traced him back to the sanitarium where he was being kept locked away. I didn't think I would get to him alive.",
        "Mallet: Last night, when I was here...",
        "Gus: I was here, but I was just get reacquainted with my wife.",
        "Mallet: This is amazing. This is great. Harley, I'm so happy for you. And you were right-- you were right not to give up on him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: Why would you tell Gus that you brought me back to town to take Spaulding from Harley?",
        "Alan: I didn't tell Gus. Beth figured it out. She confronted me and he was in the next room on painkillers. So there's a possibility that he didn't understand what we were saying, but there's a possibility he did understand.",
        "Alan-Michael: And you're telling me this, why, to enjoy my misery?",
        "Alan: To forewarn you.",
        "Alan-Michael: Right.",
        "Alan: You told me recently I may need your help down the road, but I can't use your help if you're going to be out of Spaulding. I need you to do a little damage control for me inside of Spaulding, in the boardroom, as well as the bedroom.",
        "Alan-Michael: Here we go.",
        "Alan: What do you think Marina would do if she found out you're trying to shaft her Aunt Harley?",
        "Alan-Michael: I have nothing against Harley personally.",
        "Alan: Tell that to Marina. If the truth comes out, I guess there would be a possibility that she wouldn't leave you, and I guess there's also a possibility that Buzz and Frank won't try to kill you. Because, you see, those Coopers stick together. That's what we have to do, son, stick together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Milk. Oh.. you know, Buzz, when I first found out I was pregnant, I thought about raising this child on my own. But then I thought about how Lizzie and James lost their father and I didn't want to do that to another child. And I also know that Alan sees this as his last chance to make up for past mistakes, so he will do whatever it takes to keep me and the baby safe.",
        "Buzz: But can you be happy with him?",
        "Beth: But I am happy. I am doing what's best for my child.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, when it comes to kids, you've got to do what you've got to do, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Emma, you did such a great job on this. Who are all of these people? That's like your mommy, and that's me and that's you, and who's that?",
        "Olivia: I think that's your father. She likes him a lot.",
        "Frank: Wow, you have good taste. Who doesn't? Olivia, I was wondering. You probably run into a lot of eligible women at the hotel, right?",
        "Olivia: Why are we whispering?",
        "Frank: I was wondering, you probably know a couple that are really lonely and would like some company, right? No, I'm not thinking for me. I'm thinking for Dad.",
        "Olivia: Buzz?",
        "Frank: Yeah, Dad's been away from it for a long time, and I was just thinking he would like some, well, female companionship. That sounded a little weird. Like a date. You know, Dad could use a date.",
        "Olivia: Yeah. No, I can't think of anybody offhand.",
        "Frank: Well, if you do, let me know. Because my major project for April is to, well, get my father back in the saddle, and to well get Alan-Michael away from Marina. And Emma, guess what my number one priority is? Yes, number one. It's to spend more time with you and your mommy. So, how about that lunch? Would you like to go to lunch? Okay.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, sure, can we have some service?",
        "Frank: Here? You know what, I was thinking of something special. Something totally different. Would you like to go to Towers for lunch? Would you, Emma? What do you think? Is that a yes? Mom, what do you think?",
        "Olivia: I go with the flow.",
        "Frank: All right. Then let's get on out of here.",
        "Olivia: Can you take her?",
        "Frank: Sure, I'll take her. Come on, Emma. Hey, Pop, I'm going to take these beautiful ladies to lunch, so I'll see you shortly, all right?",
        "Buzz: Okay, have fun.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Baby, help me.",
        "Dinah: So the two of you have been alone together ever since you found him?",
        "Gus: It's my thing. I just wasn't ready to deal with the real world yet-- I should say Beth and Alan.",
        "Harley: They will be dealt with eventually.",
        "Mallet: Alan had you hidden this whole time?",
        "Gus: No, it's Beth. Beth found Alan and me right after the car accident. She managed to take us up to this cabin. You were at this cabin. You know what I'm talking about? Beth kept us up here the whole time.",
        "Mallet: Beth did that?",
        "Gus: Beth is a nut job, okay? She was going to leave us here to die, but then she found out she was pregnant, and so the two of them ganged up to get rid of me. And that's how that worked. It almost worked if it wasn't for my girl. She's perfect, unwavering.",
        "Dinah: She's got incredible strength, that's for sure.",
        "Mallet: So do we go after them now?",
        "Gus: No. We don't need to pull you into our drama. I understand you were there for her when I was gone, and I'm very thankful and appreciative. Let's leave it at that.",
        "Dinah: Well, Mallet was there for Harley, Gus, more than you know. In fact, you have no idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: What are you having, Frank?",
        "Frank: You know what? I'm not sure. Let's see. ( Cell phone ringing ) Oh, no, I'm sorry.",
        "Olivia: It's okay.",
        "Frank: Cooper here.",
        "Buzz: Frank, you got a call here.",
        "Frank: You know what, I got a bad signal here. Hold on a second. That's much better. Hold on, you said something about a call coming in?",
        "Buzz: Yeah, you got a call here from the station about rescheduling something for next week. I don't know why they called here.",
        "Frank: Yeah, I don't know why they're calling you either. No one's supposed to call me unless in important. I'm taking a personal day. I'm here with Emma and Olivia.",
        "Buzz: It sounds like fun.",
        "Frank: It is. But we've only been here 20 minutes. We just sat down to have some lunch at Towers.",
        "Buzz: Towers? Nice.",
        "Frank: Hey, listen, Pop. You know Olivia pretty well.",
        "Buzz: Not that well.",
        "Frank: Do you think she would like me ordering lunch for her? I'm sitting next to this other couple and this guy was ordering for his wife and she really seemed to enjoy it.",
        "Buzz: Frank, she's an independent lady. If you go ordering for her, she's liable to hurt you, Frank.",
        "Frank: Okay. Thanks for the heads-up. See, you know her better than you thought. I would really like to do something nice for her, like a nice gesture.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, there is something that she told me once. I think she... she might like it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: I don't know where Gus is, but if and when he resurfaces, life as you know it now will end. You will be as hated as I am.",
        "Alan Michael: That will never happen.",
        "Marina: So, I was thinking that once...",
        "Alan-Michael: My dad stopped by.",
        "Marina: Alan.",
        "Alan-Michael: A little harassment call.",
        "Marina: Nice. So are you finished?",
        "Alan: Marina, have I ever told you that you remind me of your Aunt Harley?",
        "Marina: Thank you, Alan, I will take that as a compliment.",
        "Alan: I didn't mean it as one.",
        "Marina: Oh. Well, fortunately for Alan- Michael here, he bears no resemblance of his father.",
        "Alan: I wouldn't be so sure of that.",
        "Alan-Michael: Good-bye, Dad.",
        "Alan: Good-bye, son.",
        "Harley: So he came by at breakfast just to hassle you?",
        "Alan-Michael: Making up for lost time. It's been months since he can torture one of his sons.",
        "Marina: Only if you let him, and you won't.",
        "Alan-Michael: Yeah.",
        "Marina: You are your own man, Alan-Michael. It's one of the many, many, many things that I like about you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: I'm not an old man.",
        "Mallet: You know, Gus, Harley had a really, really tough time while you were away. I mean, you can just imagine. But thankfully, none of that matters now.",
        "Dinah: Oh, sure it does.",
        "Harley: The point is everything has worked out for the best, right? Because I got my husband back, and now you guys can stop worrying about my problems, and you can focus on being with each other and having fun with each other, right?",
        "Dinah: Um... you know, Gus, I bet Harley has told you a bunch of stuff that has happened since you've been gone, but I bet she hasn't told you everything.",
        "Mallet: But there's a lot of time for that later.",
        "Dinah: No. It's a good time to talk about things in the present. I feel like sharing.",
        "Mallet: Don't you think Gus has enough to process right now?",
        "Harley: No, I think Dinah's right. Because there is something very important I wanted to tell Gus, and I'm glad you're here for it. And that's actually...",
        "Gus: What?",
        "Harley: How amazing you've been the last few months, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: Wow, we're bringing it to me?",
        "Harley: She stepped in for me at Spaulding so I could spend all of my time looking for you. And she did such an amazing job, I wouldn't be surprised if they asked me to take a hike and asked you to stay on permanently.",
        "Dinah: Oh, that's doubtful. I've been in a little over my head as of lately.",
        "Harley: Not true. The way you whipped marketing into shape, the crisis in Japan. Dinah, you're amazing.",
        "Dinah: That was all Alan- Michael.",
        "Harley: But you were the one who came up with the strategy and put it into play. Isn't it cool to realize you're good at something you didn't know you wanted to do?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, yeah. It's cool.",
        "Gus: Well I don't care much about the business at the moment. I just want to thank both of you guys. You helped her, and you helped us get back together. I'm in debt; I appreciate it.",
        "Harley: I do, too, really. And I'm sorry, I'm the one who's rambling and rambling. You wanted to say something, Dinah. What is it?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I did. I have something to say to both of you. Something really important.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liz Keifer, \"Inside The Light.\" When I'm not working, I'm a mom, so I'm not sure what free time is. I'm devoted to living life in truth and to being who I am, not who people think I should be or who people tell me to be. See Blake, Wednesday, April 5th, \"Inside The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: All right, lay it on. What's on your mind?",
        "Dinah: What I wanted to say was, um... I can't wait until you come back, Harley. To come back to work as CEO. You, um... you're pretty amazing. You're fun to work with, and... whoo, it's going to be good to have you back. Just don't expect me to fetch your coffee.",
        "Harley: Like I ever asked you to.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, well, don't expect me to start.",
        "Harley: ( Laughs )",
        "Dinah: The other thing is, Gus, I am thrilled that you're back, buddy. Give me a hug. Oh, you know what? Harley's missed you a lot. Harley's missed you a lot, and everything is going to go back to normal. We're all going to be fine, okay? So I'm sure the two of you probably want to, you know, share some time alone together. And, Harley, we'll be talking.",
        "Harley: You bet.",
        "Mallet: Bye, guys. Partner.",
        "Gus: Take it easy.",
        "Mallet: Welcome back. Good to see your face.",
        "Mallet: Hey. ( Sighs ) Thank you. ( Sighs )",
        "Gus: She's acting weird, huh?",
        "Harley: You think? Well, I'm sure she's in shock. It's not every day you come face to face with a dead person. So, okay, well, you've seen people, and people have seen you, so the honeymoon is over. It's time to get back out there and let everybody know you're alive.",
        "Gus: I'm a gift to the world.",
        "Harley: Yes, you are.",
        "Gus: I'm a gift.",
        "Harley: You are, you're a gift. I'll put a bow on you.",
        "Gus: Well, you know, first we've got to figure out what we're going do. We do need to work it out, what we're going to do about Alan and Beth.",
        "Harley: No, no plans.",
        "Gus: No, listen please. I'm just asking you to listen.",
        "Harley: No plans, because that's how we got into this trouble in the first place. No more lying, no more any of that stuff, okay?",
        "Gus: Fine.",
        "Harley: We're together. That's all that matters.",
        "Gus: We don't make our plans, though? We don't make our plans? It doesn't mean that Alan's not up to something. He's probably scheming up something right now to take us down. Did you ever think about that?",
        "Harley: I just want to celebrate the fact that you're home, okay? I just want everybody to know how happy I am that you're back, okay?",
        "Gus: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: So where were we before your father came here and interrupted us? I believe it was somewhere... here. No, no, no, no.",
        "Alan-Michael: I just have to make one quick phone call.",
        "Marina: Business? You are choosing business over this? So what if I...",
        "Alan-Michael: Keep doing that slowly, like that. Hey, it's your boss.",
        "Alan: I take it you can't talk freely.",
        "Alan-Michael: I need you to get on the stick right now.",
        "Marina: Me?",
        "Alan-Michael: Oh, you're bad. Contact the board, every single member.",
        "Alan: Why?",
        "Alan-Michael: Tell them there's an emergency meeting tonight. That matter that I mentioned to them, it's come to a head. There will be some changes coming down. I need to bring them up to speed and get their support.",
        "Alan: It's an interesting idea. Don't know why I didn't think of it myself.",
        "Alan-Michael: Tell them that their attendance is imperative.",
        "Alan: I will do that, not to worry. But I do have one question: What about the girl?",
        "Alan-Michael: I'll take care of that. You just get started on this. And I'll check in with you later.",
        "Marina: A special board meeting, huh? It must be pretty important.",
        "Alan-Michael: This is important.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: You'd better tell me what's going on, Alan. Because in case you've forgotten, my freedom is at stake here, mine and your child's.",
        "Alan: Beth, I'm not hiding anything from you. I mean, you know how much you mean to me.",
        "Beth: Do I, Alan?",
        "Alan: Yes.",
        "Beth: And did I mean a lot to you when you were trying to divorce me? Hmm?",
        "Alan: Don't go there. That is in the past now. And... and... well, hello, Gus.",
        "Gus: Hello, Dad.",
        "Alan: If you'll excuse us, we're on our way down to the police station to make a statement. Then I'm sure you'll be hearing from the district attorney, so my advice to you is to get a lawyer.",
        "Gus: That's funny, Dad. I learned a very valuable lesson with you. You're kind of like teflon. You know, whatever anybody throws at you always slides right off. So I can't fight you and win. So I've decided I'm not going to go after you. Instead, I'm going to go after your wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Do you see how well she colors outside the lines?",
        "Frank: Gee, I wonder where she learned that from.",
        "Olivia: Is it me or has our waiter just disappeared?",
        "Frank: You know, I think it might just be you.",
        "Olivia: No, I'm serious, Frank. I mean, he hasn't taken our order yet.",
        "Frank: Maybe he doesn't need to. Maybe I took the liberty of ordering for you.",
        "Olivia: Really? Oh.",
        "Frank: Well.",
        "Olivia: Thank you.",
        "Waiter: The chef says bon ap\u00e9tit. She'll be happy to make this for you any time.",
        "Olivia: Stuffed pizza! It's my favorite food in the entire world.",
        "Frank: Really?",
        "Olivia: Yeah, are you kidding me? When I came to the states and landed in Chicago, this is what I ate, and I fell in love with this. Oh, my gosh, I've never tasted anything so heavy and greasy and amazing in my life.",
        "Frank: ( Laughs ) Well, I didn't know which one was your favorite, so I kind of got a little assortment there for you. You've got spinach and sausage, and double cheese.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, I want all that.",
        "Frank: And, Emma, look what I have for you. Look, macaroni and cheese and chicken fingers!",
        "Olivia: It's so perfect. Right, Em? This is why you disappeared in the direction of the kitchen earlier?",
        "Frank: Um... I know the chef. Gina is from the south side of Chicago, so I figured she would know the recipe for that, so...",
        "Olivia: Wow! I am blown away. But how did you know this is my favorite food?",

        "Harley: Sweetie, do you remember what we talked about?",
        "Gus: Yeah, yeah. This is the deal, okay? It's a take-it-or-leave-it deal. It's a bargain, actually. You stay away from my wife, and I'll stay away from yours. Okay? Because if you don't, I'll make sure that your wife has your baby in prison. And you know how I know that? Because I've got your number. No, literally. I have all of your numbers: Your bank records, your credit cards, what you bought, when you bought it, why you bought it when I was your prisoner up in that cabin. I'm sure the D.A. would have a field day with all of those receipts, you know? And, of course, there's the tox strain..screen.",
        "Beth: What? What are you talking about, Gus?",
        "Gus: Tox screen. I went to Cedars and they did my blood work. They found narcotics in my blood. Isn't that amazing? That stuff, that analgesic stuff, it stays in your bloodstream. It's... you know, I don't know how it got there. The pills. Somebody gave me those pills, and I wonder why. Exactly. I'm sure the D.A. would wonder, also. ( Laughs ) You know, I know, I'm sorry, I said I wasn't going to retaliate or anything like that, but, you know, you don't draw the line, they're never going to leave us alone. You know what I'm saying?",
        "Beth: Okay, Gus, you win.",

        "Gus: Where are you going? The police station? I don't think so.",
        "Harley: Haven't you been a busy little beaver! You had time to pull Beth's credit card records? When did you get a blood test?",
        "Gus: Well, yeah. No, I didn't do any of that stuff. When do you think I did that? I was with you the whole time. Come on! I'm good.",

        "Harley: ( Laughs ) You are good, but you're not the only one who can keep secrets.",

        "Harley: Oh, I can keep a few of my own. Don't fall.",

        "Marina: I should get that. It might be the station. I'm sorry. Hello. Hi. Yeah, actually, I'm kind of in the middle of something right now, but can I call you back? What?! Are you serious? Oh, my God! Well, yes! Yes, of course, I'll have a million questions. When? Now? Okay. I will see you. Come on, get up. We've got to go.",

        "Olivia: Who was it? It didn't sound bad.",

        "Mallet: Because it would have been cruel, and because it's over. And because Harley loves Gus, and because I love you.",
        "Dinah: No, you know what? The new and improved Dinah-- which I am-- I... I'm not that much of an angel. And I did this for me, Mallet. Because you know what? If I had said one word to Gus or Harley, I'm sure it would have ruined everything between the two of them, and it would absolutely have ended things with you and me. And I...
