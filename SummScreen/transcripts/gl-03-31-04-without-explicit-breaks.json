        "Harley: There is just nothing. It's like she vanished.",
        "Reva: Well, we can't quit.",
        "Harley: Reva, these tunnels go on under the whole town, practically. They go on forever.",
        "Reva: Harley, she's alive. You found this escape tunnel yourself.",
        "Harley: Yeah, but reva...",
        "Reva: Carrie did not wash down the river. This is how she escaped.",
        "Harley: That was a theory. Obviously it's not panning out for us.",
        "Reva: Oh, you know what? Don't start doubting yourself now.",
        "Harley: All right. Maybe there's a secret door, something that we missed, you know, what I mean?",
        "Reva: I think we're on the right track. We should just keep going.",
        "Harley: Which way do you want to go?",
        "Reva: This way.",
        "Harley: Well, we can't just follow your gut, reva. We have... you know what? Forget I said anything. I'll follow you.",
        "Bill: Well, congratulations, daddy-O.",
        "Rick: Thanks, buddy.",
        "Bill: Can we see her?",
        "Rick: Sure. Just so you know, she's too young to vote. It wasn't that funny. No, it wasn'T.",
        "Bill: Hey, you going to come?",
        "Eden: In a second. I have to make a phone call. Besides, babies don't really like me very much.",
        "Bill: Oh,ome on. I doubt that. But if you think you need the practice, you know, it's only a matter of time until...",
        "Eden: I'll just make my call and then I'll be in, okay?",
        "Bill: All right.",
        "Rick: Actually, you can't use that. There's a pay phone right over there.",
        "Eden: Oh, right. You go ahead. I'll be right there.",
        "Bill: All right. Stay cool.",
        "Gus: What's this?",
        "Christopher: Oh, hi. I'm early.",
        "Beth: I'm glad.",
        "Christopher: Oh?",
        "Beth: I want to show you something, and lizzie's still upstairs, and we have a little time. So... it's the school paper-- \"a look behind the scenes at 'romeo and juliet'.\"",
        "Christopher: That's a great picture of lizzie.",
        "Beth: She looks happy, doesn't she?",
        "Christopher: She does.",
        "Beth: Thank you. Thank you for helping her put her life back together. And don't tell me that you were just doing your job.",
        "Christopher: I was just doing my job, but you're welcome.",
        "Beth: It's just wonderful. Her grades have improved, she loves the play, she's making an effort with olivia.",
        "Christopher: She's made great strides, I'll agree with you.",
        "Beth: Yes, she has.",
        "Lillian: Hi.",
        "Beth: Hi, mom.",
        "Lillian: Where's lizzie, honey?",
        "Beth: She's upstairs in her bedroom.",
        "Lillian: No, I just was in her room, and then I looked around in the kitchen and places. I didn't see her anywhere.",
        "Sam: Come on. Come on, pick up. Where the hell are you? Come on.",
        "Olivia: Hey.",
        "Sam: We've been trying to call you.",

        "Nanny: I don't know what happened.",
        "Olivia: Sam?",
        "Sam: She isn't here.",
        "Olivia: What do you mean she isn't here? Emma?",
        "Sam: Olivia, she's not in there. Someone broke in. She's gone.",
        "Olivia: Oh, god. When was the last time you saw her in her crib?",
        "Nanny: Ten minutes ago, maybe 15.",
        "Olivia: There's a difference. Was it ten minutes or was it 15 minutes?",
        "Nanny: I don't remember.",
        "Olivia: Just think. Think. Was it ten minutes or was it 15 minutes?",
        "Nanny: I'm sorry. I don't remember.",
        "Olivia: How can you not remember?!",
        "Sam: Olivia, eva was in the bathroom preparing emma's bath. The monitor was turned on.",
        "Olivia: But you didn't hear anything? How could you not hear anything?",
        "Sam: Olivia, we need to call the police.",
        "Olivia: Who took my baby? It was phillip.",
        "Sam: What? You were just with phillip. He couldn'T...",
        "Olivia: No. The other day at the hospital he was talking about the baby. He was talking about emma. He was talking to lizzie.",
        "Beth: Well, you're right. She's not in the house. She's nowhere to be found.",
        "Christopher: Well, let's give her a few more minutes. She isn't late yet.",
        "Beth: I just assumed that she was upstairs because she should have been home half an hour ago.",
        "Christopher: Well, you know teenage girls.",
        "Lillian: I know lizzie.",
        "Beth: Maybe she stayed for play practice.",
        "Christopher: Why don't you call her, and then we'll know?",
        "Beth: You're right. (Phone ringing)",
        "Lizzie: Here we are, home sweet home. We did it. We did it. Olivia lost, didn't she? Hold on. Sorry. I'm sorry, mom. You're disturbing the baby. I've got to go. That was annoying wasn't it? Yes, it was. It's okay. Nobody's going to bother us no more. No more. So, what do you think, huh? What do you think of the place? I know, I know. It's not the mansion or anything. I know, sweetie. But it's okay. It's better being here than it is with that... well, you know, your mom. It's okay, baby. It's all right. It'll be better here. We can just hang out here until daddy comes back, okay? (Baby crying) it's okay. No one's going to know we're here, and we're not going to tell anybody, are we? No. No. No, we're not.",
        "Tammy: What do you think? Will this work for the cast party after the play?",
        "Edmund: Oh, tammy, that's entirely up to you. You and your mother are giving the part, and she wants you to make all the decisions.",
        "Tammy: Well, I like it. It's grown up, and it's not the beacon. I love the balcony.",
        "Edmund: Well, of course you would, juliet.",
        "Tammy: And mom's been so busy planning all that election night stuff, I kind of want to give her a break. I think this will be easier for her.",
        "Edmund: A talented actress and a considerate daughter.",
        "Tammy: I try. Well, I'm glad we decided to eat here. What do you recommend?",
        "Edmund: Well, I've always been somewhat partial to the salmon.",
        "Tammy: Hmm. Maybe I'll try that, then. Hi, guys.",
        "Edmund: Hello.",
        "Sandy: Howdy.",
        "Joey: Love this place for rehearsal. Ma was dying to come, but she had to work. She's never been here before.",
        "Edmund: Well, maybe next time.",
        "Sandy: So what should I try today?",
        "Tammy: Edmund likes the salmon.",
        "Edmund: Are we still waiting for lizzie?",
        "Sandy: Ah, she's always late. She likes to make an entrance.",
        "Gus: You got engaged?",
        "Eden: Yeah.",
        "Gus: To who?",
        "Eden: To bill. Who else? I was going to call you, nicky.",
        "Gus: Oh. What's with the necklace?",
        "Eden: We're not telling anyone yet.",
        "Gus: Your secret's safe with me. I won't say a word.",
        "Eden: That doesn't mean you, nicky. I was... it just happened last night, okay?",
        "Gus: Well, I'M... congratulations.",
        "Eden: Thanks.",
        "Gus: I was just here to see the bauer kid, so I've got to...",
        "Eden: He reminds me of dad, nicky. Bill. He's a real stand-up guy.",
        "Gus: Well, good. You deserve nothing less.",
        "Eden: I got lucky.",
        "Gus: Well, then, put the ring on your finger, show it off to people, you know?",
        "Eden: I can'T.",
        "Gus: Of course you can. Come on. I do have to go, though. I've got to go to the station.",
        "Eden: The station?",
        "Gus: Yeah, yeah. I'm back on duty.",
        "Eden: You quit spaulding?",
        "Gus: Don't you work there? Don't you hear the buzz?",
        "Eden: Alex keeps me out of the loop.",
        "Gus: Oh, you too, huh?",
        "Eden: What about alan?",
        "Gus: What about him?",
        "Eden: I can't imagine he's happy about you leaving.",
        "Gus: He's got much bigger fish to fry. But I do have to go, so I'll see you around, kid, all right?",
        "Eden: Nicky! I don't want you to go.",
        "Gus: Why?",
        "Eden: Because I need you.",
        "Bill: Okay, so now you have to tell me the truth, here, okay? Well, did mel take a swing at you in the delivery room or anything like that, or...",
        "Rick: No, but there were times that, you know, she was a little angry with me, I think. I'm not sure. I mean, she'd say stuff like, \"don't touch me,\" \"why did you do this to me,\" and, \"rick, don't just stand there with that stupid look on your face, do something.\" But other than those comments, i think she really appreciated...",
        "Bill: Yeah. Well, I'm sure she did. I'm sure she did. My goodness, two kids. You've got yourself a real family. Did jude see his little sister?",
        "Rick: Michelle brought him by about an hour ago. I don't think he was that impressed, but I think they'll get along fine.",
        "Bill: Oh, of course. Boy, girl. Let's see. Jude and...",
        "Rick: No name yet.",
        "Bill: I'm sorry?",
        "Rick: No name yet. We...",
        "Bill: She's here. You've seen this child. This child needs a name, rick.",
        "Rick: We're working on it. It's not easy.",
        "Bill: You're over-thinking it. You're over-thinking it. You're over-thinking it. Let me go take a look, and I'll name her, okay? I'll go take a look.",
        "Rick: You're not going to name my kid.",
        "Harley: Maybe we should turn back.",
        "Reva: I was so sure.",
        "Harley: I know, but reva, look at this. It's obvious nobody's been here for a long time.",
        "Reva: Okay, well, then let's go back and try another way. Harley?",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Carrie: So you finally found me. Well, I'm surprised it took you so long.",
        "Harley: No, no, no. Reva, no.",
        "Carrie: Oh, I'm not armed. It's a pity your father didn't check me before he tried to shoot me. But then, of course, he left that to marah, didn't he? Shot me in the back and left me to die here in this cold, dark, underground place.",
        "Reva: You got exactly what you deserved.",
        "Harley: She doesn't look too good.",
        "Reva: Tough. She's got to hold on long enough to clear marah's name.",
        "Harley: That's fine, but we've got to get a doctor down here.",
        "Reva: Well, we can't just leave her here. We can't leave her here.",
        "Harley: We're not going to leave her here, okay? I will stay with her, you go get help.",
        "Reva: No. No, she's marah's only hope. I'm not taking my eyes off her for a second.",
        "Harley: Reva, I'M...",
        "Reva: Harley, it's fine! I'll stay, you go. You go and get help.",
        "Harley: All right. All right. I'd leave my gun, but in your current state of mind...",
        "Reva: It's probably not the best idea.",
        "Harley: I'll leave my bag. I can move a lot faster that way. Here, take that.",
        "Reva: Thanks.",
        "Harley: Don't take your eye off of her.",
        "Reva: Don't worry. So you were just going to let marah twist in the wind, weren't you?",
        "Carrie: Yes. They stole maryanne from me. Someone has to pay.",
        "Reva: Oh, someone's going to pay, all right. I'm going to make sure you get out of here so that I can watch you pay for what you did to my family for the rest of your miserable life.",
        "Rick: Okay, I need a name.",
        "Bill: You know what? I'm going to keep them to myself, because I think I need all the names I can get for my own kids. Yeah.",
        "Rick: Your kids? You're just a kid yourself.",
        "Bill: No, no, no, no. I'm all growed up, says my daddy, after he handed over the company. And besides, let me tell you a little secret.",
        "Rick: What's that?",
        "Bill: Eden and I, we're getting married.",
        "Rick: Wow.",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Rick: That's amazing.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, good amazing or...",
        "Rick: Yeah.",
        "Bill: Okay.",
        "Rick: Yeah. Of course. She's a very patient woman.",
        "Bill: What do you mean by that?",
        "Rick: She's a very lucky woman, that's what I meant.",
        "Bill: Well, yeah. Well, I'm a lucky guy. And besides, the engagement, it's a secret, so don't go around, you know, talking. Yeah, please don'T.",
        "Rick: I'm good at keeping secrets.",
        "Bill: Thank you.",
        "Rick: Yeah. You seem happy.",
        "Bill: I am. I am. Yeah.",
        "Rick: Oh, this is making sense. That's why we had the sensitive guy talk the other day. You were asking me about the marriage thing.",
        "Bill: Yeah. Well, you know, you found me out. I was doing a little research. You know, I was a little nervous, you know? But once I popped the question, I knew I was doing the smartest thing. It's like now I've got a handle on my future. I know where I'm going, and I've never been happier.",
        "Eden: I'm sorry, this isn't fair. I throw you out of my life for the better part of the year, and then suddenly I just change my mind.",
        "Gus: People change their mind. You're entitled to change your mind.",
        "Eden: No, I'm not.",
        "Gus: Do you want to make this difficult? Because we... you know.",
        "Eden: I had no right to take you for granted.",
        "Gus: I knew you were coming back. You know why? Because I am like your christmas candy. Ah, pretending like you don't know what I'm talking about.",
        "Eden: No, I don'T.",
        "Gus: You know exactly what I'm saying. Just like all the other kids that don't want christmas to end...",
        "Eden: And you didn't?",
        "Gus: You would take a piece of candy, the last piece of christmas candy, and you would hide it...",
        "Eden: In my jacket pocket.",
        "Gus: ...Like a little insurance police for yourself, a little insurance policy.",
        "Eden: You know, christmas didn't have to end if I could just reach in my pocket, and there it was.",
        "Gus: I think about us. I thought, \"that's it. I am like her... I am like her christmas candy. That's what I am.\"",
        "Eden: Oh, a six-month-old piece of candy with lint all on it?",
        "Gus: Perfect. That's what I am.",
        "Eden: I missed you.",
        "Joey: I'm starving.",
        "Sandy: I second that. Yes, lizzie, it's sandy here. We're all waiting for you at towers. Where are you at? Make it quick, princess. We're hungry.",
        "Edmund: Let's give her a few more minutes, all right?",
        "Tammy: Okay. Well, do you want to go over that scene in act 2 again?",
        "Joey: Again?",
        "Edmund: Oh, please, tammy. The man's faint with hunger. If you'd like, I can run over it with you.",
        "Tammy: Please? That would be great.",
        "Sandy: Maybe by then lizzie will grace us with her presence.",
        "Tammy: I hope so. This is late even for her.",
        "Olivia: Where is she? Where's that crazy bitch daughter of yours?",
        "Beth: Olivia?",
        "Olivia: Where is she?",
        "Beth: Why do you want to know?",
        "Olivia: Where is lizzie?",
        "Beth: Well, I don't know. I was just trying to call her.",
        "Olivia: Does anybody know where she is?",
        "Christopher: Calm down, olivia.",
        "Olivia: Just tell me where she is!",
        "Lillian: We don't know.",
        "Beth: Olivia, why don't you tell us why you're so upset?",
        "Olivia: I'm upset because your daughter is dangerous.",
        "Beth: My daughter is doing much better. If you want to talk to me calmly, fine.",
        "Olivia: Oh, god. I never should have brought emma back here. I never should have brought her back here.",
        "Beth: Emma? What are you talking about, ol...",
        "Olivia: My daughter. My daughter.",
        "Beth: Olivia...",
        "Olivia: You want to help me, go find that nut job you call your patient.",
        "Christopher: Olivia, calm down.",
        "Olivia: My baby is alive. She's alive.",
        "Sandy: Olivia's telling the truth.",
        "Olivia: And lizzie found out about her and she took her. And god only knows what she's going to do to her. (Baby crying)",
        "Lizzie: It's okay, honey. It's okay. Everything's okay. What's wrong? Are you hungry? Are you hungry? I bet you are, but you... we can see if there's something in the kitchen. Okay. (Baby crying) stay right here. Okay. It's okay. Yeah, sweetie. Okay. Oh. Okay. Well, you know what? I'm going to have to run out and get something, baby. Okay. You know what? Here. Here we go. It's going to be okay. Here we go. It's all right, honey. Here we go. This should keep you there until I get back, okay? I'm sorry. I'll be right back, I promise. I'll be right back, okay? Sorry.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, honey, I'm back. I'm back. Yes, I got you bunches of stuff. You're going to love having me as your big sister, because i love spending money on you. Yes, I do. I do. Come here. Come here. You're such a big, beautiful girl. Hello. It's okay. It's okay. You're going to go see daddy, okay? Oh, it's okay. If the big bad nurse is gone we can go in there and see him. Come on. ( Baby crying) we can give daddy a gift. (Baby crying) come on. Oh, it makes daddy so happy. Yeah, he can see his two girls together. Come on.",
        "Beth: I don't believe any of this.",
        "Lillian: Beth, I could just think what lizzie felt when she stumbled on this lie. I mean, she was doing so much better. Can you imagine how shocked she was when she found out olivia's baby was alive?",
        "Beth: I can only imagine, because I know how i feel. But you know, mom, lizzie knew. She knew olivia was something from us from the time she first came back to town and then phillip told us the other day about the baby when we were at ravenwood. I thought he was confused. But he was trying to tell us the truth.",
        "Lillian: Olivia, why would you tell phillip about this?",
        "Olivia: I told him because i had to.",
        "Sam: And he slipped the other day in front of lizzie, he must have said more about the baby.",
        "Lillian: But it just seems so unfair to tell him when the state he's in is so bad.",
        "Olivia: I can't believe this. You people are unbelievable. You know what? I'm the one who's crazy. I'm crazy for ever bringing my daughter back here!",
        "Sandy: So you must be scoring big points with cassie these days.",
        "Edmund: How's that?",
        "Sandy: Well, you've become sort of a camp counselor/actg coach/surrogate father for tammy and her friends.",
        "Edmund: My god, I never knew that going in. That's way too much responsibility.",
        "Sandy: Big results though. Lizzie, joey, tammy. They're a pretty intense group. You've brought out the best in all of them.",
        "Edmund: Well, thank you. I hope I didn't step on your toes as the director.",
        "Sandy: Yeah, well, at first i was a little less then enthused about having you around. But that was personal. And as it turns out I learned a lot, too. So, thank you.",
        "Edmund: Thank you. What has happened to our group? No lizzie. And now tammy and joey have disappeared.",
        "Sandy: Yeah, I'm guessing the lovebirds are checking out the balcony.",
        "Edmund: Oh, yes. They're very sweet together.",
        "Sandy: They are, aren't they? Joey's crazy about her. He tries a little too hard sometimes.",
        "Edmund: Well, I've been guilty of that crime myself.",
        "Sandy: Really? With aunt cassie?",
        "Edmund: Aunt cassie.",
        "Sandy: Yeah, aunt cass... cass...",
        "Edmund: (Laughs)",
        "Sandy: Does it sound weird me saying it? Because I like saying it. I mean it'S... it's so funny. It's been slowing going with reva. But cassie and we've connected right away.",
        "Edmund: I understand. She's taken a great affection to you. Well, look at our waiter. I think he's terrified that we haven't ordered yet. Perhaps we should proceed without lizzie.",
        "Sandy: Yeah, I concur. I'll go get romeo and juliet.",
        "Edmund: No, no, I'll do it. I could use the fresh air. You placate the waiter and keep an eye out for the wavered lizzie. Wayward lizzie.",
        "Joey: I think we should get back inside. Maybe lizzie's here. We can eat.",
        "Tammy: Oh, stay one more second. Please. I love it out here. You can see the whole town. It's so beautiful.",
        "Joey: You think so? I don't know. I don't see springfield like that. I guess when you live somewhere for a while you don't see it one way or the other. I think you'd hate it, tammy, compared to san cristobal.",
        "Tammy: Well, that was a completely different world. There's no comparing the two.",
        "Joey: I know the beacon's nice and everything, but it's no palace. Do you wish you still lived there?",
        "Tammy: I would love that. If it meant that richard was still alive and he and my mom were still together like they were. They loved each other so much.",
        "Joey: But you wouldn't want to go back now?",
        "Tammy: Well, that depends on who I go back with.",
        "Edmund: \"Alas, that love whose view is muffled still should wit out eyes see path ways to his will.\" Where shall we dine? Oh, me. What fray was here?",
        "Joey: How do you do that?",
        "Tammy: Good timing. We were just talking about san cristobel.",
        "Edmund: And we were just talking about lunch. The waiter is hovering.",
        "Joey: That is my cue. I will be at the table.",
        "Tammy: I'll be right there.",
        "Edmund: It's pretty, isn't it?",
        "Tammy: That's what I was just saying to joey.",
        "Edmund: I used to hate it. I never imagined anything up here.",
        "Tammy: But you're all right with it now, right? I mean, even without all the money and the palace and the uniforms...",
        "Edmund: Well, I do, I do miss the uniforms. A bit less now of course that you showed joey that picture and he's informed me that I look like that man in the \"sound of music\" that ma loved so much.",
        "Tammy: Oh, but you are way handsomer.",
        "Edmund: Yes. Yes, I am. Ah, tammy, I am happy. I'm a much richer man than I was in san cristobal. And that's thanks to you and your mother and brothers. There's honestly only one thing missing in my life.",
        "Tammy: Let me guess. Lunch.",
        "Edmund: Oh. Shall we?",
        "Reva: You're going to die alone in prison. And I won't feel one bit sorry for you.",
        "Carrie: I wasn't aware that i was asking for your sympathy.",
        "Reva: Oh, please. You would love for the world to feel sorry for you. You talk about your suffering. It's always about you, isn't it? Your suffering, your pain. Poor carrie. Well, what about maryanne?",
        "Carrie: Everything I have done, I have done for maryanne.",
        "Reva: Oh, please. She didn't deserve to die such a horrible death. That was an accident. Nobody set out that night to kill maryanne.",
        "Carrie: How do you know? A young woman is dead. Someone has got to be punished.",
        "Reva: So what? You orchestrated your own death. You lured all the players to the fun house.",
        "Carrie: Brava. Brava, reva. I knew. I always knew that I should be more careful about you. You with your strange gifts.",
        "Reva: You were actually willing to die for revenge.",
        "Carrie: Yes. Revenge, as you know, is a dish that is best eaten cold.",
        "Reva: What a life. What a life you've had. 30 years of hate. And you spread it over to three innocent young girls who's only mistake was befriending you.",
        "Carrie: Oh, no. No, you've got it wrong. But actually, in a way I became rather... rather fond of them. Especially marah.",
        "Eden: I should go see bill. He's with rick and the baby.",
        "Gus: I saw them earlier, so...",
        "Eden: Should I call?",
        "Gus: No, I'll call. I'll call you. Well, yeah, I mean, call me. We'll call each other. It's fine. How's that?",
        "Eden: Then we'll talk soon?",
        "Gus: Eden, is there something that you wanted to tell me because I got the feeling...",
        "Eden: You know, bill got promoted at lewis. But right after it happened vinnie salerno sent me flowers to congratulate me.",
        "Gus: Salerno?",
        "Eden: Yeah. And that's not all.",
        "Gus: What else?",
        "Eden: He showed up at the beacon the night that bill proposed. He sent us champagne.",
        "Gus: Really? Well, how did he know?",
        "Eden: He's watching me, nicky. It's a signal, isn't it?",
        "Gus: Yeah, I'd say so.",
        "Eden: What do you know?",
        "Gus: Nothing.",
        "Eden: Come on, nicky, you know something. I know you do.",
        "Gus: Don't worry about salerno, all right? You just worry about that hubby- to-be of yours who put the ring on your finger.",
        "Eden: You're sweet.",
        "Gus: Yeah, that's me. I'm sweet.",
        "Eden: You know, I didn't come to you just because of salerno. You know that right?",
        "Gus: It would have been fine if you had.",
        "Eden: Thanks.",
        "Gus: All right. I'll talk to you.",
        "Eden: Okay.",
        "Gus: I got your message, salerno. I'm coming to get you.",
        "Carrie: Marah is certainly your daughter, reva, determined, brave and dangerous.",
        "Reva: You know nothing about my daughter, or about michelle or marina. All you know about is hate. You wanted to hurt them.",
        "Carrie: No. No, I wanted them to see... to see the truth about the men.",
        "Reva: And when they didn't see your version of the truth you drugged them, played with their minds. How did you do it? Was it the poisonous ring bit? Antimonious mickey?",
        "Carrie: I put the poison in the rings.",
        "Reva: And then you stole the rings from michelle's house.",
        "Carrie: Yes. I had to destroy all the evidence, you see. Aren't you secretly taping this, reva? Wouldn't you like for me to try and say it a little bit louder?",
        "Reva: You said you were fond of them. You had a very strange way of showing it.",
        "Carrie: Everything I did i did for maryanne, and I would do it again.",
        "Reva: Didn't help her any. How do you think we found you?",
        "Carrie: You... you've seen her? You've seen maryanne?",
        "Reva: Oh, yes. I've seen her. And she didn't seem angry; didn't seem like she wanted revenge. But I don't think she liked what you've been up to. (Laughter)",
        "Rick: I'm just saying you've missed your chance. You missed your chance of coming into that room and holding my beautiful baby girl.",
        "Eden: She was sleeping, but i saw her through the window.",
        "Bill: Yeah. She's beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful.",
        "Rick: Yeah. I wish I could carry on with you guys some more, but I actually have to pick up my son and take him out for some ice cream. You know, with the new baby and all, I don't want him feeling left out.",
        "Harley: Hey, I'm sorry, you guys. Hey.",
        "Rick: What's going on?",
        "Harley: I need you for a second.",
        "Rick: I just had a baby.",
        "Harley: That's great, I know, congratulations.",
        "Rick: Thank you.",
        "Harley: I need you. Can you grab your bag and come with me in the car?",
        "Rick: My bag's in the car already.",
        "Harley: Great. Great, great. I'll tell you on the way. Sorry.",
        "Rick: Thanks for coming.",
        "Bill: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Joey: Have you always been into the theater? I mean, did you do school plays and stuff when you were a youngster?",
        "Edmund: I did. I quite enjoyed it.",
        "Tammy: I bet you were great. What was your favorite role?",
        "Edmund: I think perhaps iago in \"othello.\"",
        "Sandy: Yeah. I can see it.",
        "Edmund: Thanks.",
        "Joey: So, when your parents came to see you, did they have to, like, sit in a special section because they were royalty? What? Ma's into that. She still can't believe that he's a prince.",
        "Edmund: I don't think my parents ever came to see anything I was in.",
        "Joey: This is good.",
        "Tammy: You were so right about the salmon, edmund.",
        "Edmund: Lizzie. Perhaps we should give her a call at home. I'm worried about her.",
        "Sandy: I'm not worried. She ditched us. She doesn't think she needs any more rehearsal. She made that very clear to me the other day.",
        "Tammy: There's no such thing as too much rehearsal.",
        "Edmund: Well, some people actually don't believe that.",
        "Joey: Yeah. You tell her, edmund.",
        "Tammy: Well, I learn something from every rehearsal.",
        "Sandy: You just like hanging out with me, your favorite cousin.",
        "Tammy: Oh, yeah. That, too. Okay, well, I'm going to call lizzie one more time and then we can order dessert. If she doesn't show up, her loss. Lizzie, it's me. You're missing the best lunch. Call us and let us know what's going on.",
        "Christopher: Lizzie hasn't shown up at ravenwood.",
        "Olivia: That's because she was too busy kidnapping my daughter.",
        "Beth: Olivia, do you have any proof?",
        "Olivia: What?",
        "Beth: Well, I'm sorry, but you're very emotional right now. And for all we know, lizzie could walk through that door any minute and somebody else could have your baby.",
        "Olivia: God, when are you going to get a clue? We're wasting our time here, sam. We need to find her.",
        "Beth: You don't know that lizzie had anything to do with this.",
        "Olivia: Beth, she hates me. She hates me!",
        "Beth: Am I the only person who sees that there might be another possibility here?",
        "Lillian: Olivia, it's possible that she wouldn't hate your baby.",
        "Olivia: Do you believe that? Really? Do you honestly believe that lizzie wouldn't take out how she feels about me on my baby?",
        "Lillian: Yes, I do.",
        "Olivia: Oh. Do you? Can you guarantee me that lizzie won't hurt emma?",
        "Christopher: No, I can'T.",
        "Olivia: (Sobs)",
        "Lizzie: It's okay, honey. It's okay. (Baby crying) oh, your food will be right there, I promise you. Okay. There we go. Cheap piece of junk. Go on. Okay, this may leak all over you, but I'll clean you up as soon as you're done, okay? Yes. Oh, I didn't warm it up. (Baby crying) okay. Your food's going to be ready so soon. I know you're thirsty. Okay, it's ready. Okay. (Baby crying) okay, okay. Yes, I know you want it. Here we go. Here you go. Come on, I thought you were thirsty, baby. Why aren't you drinking this, huh? Be a big girl and take the bottle. Come on. (Baby crying) what, do you want it in a saucer or something? Will you please... quit crying. Stop it.",
        "Sandy: All right. Thank you, edmund. That was some good stuff.",
        "Edmund: My pleasure.",
        "Joey: I've got to pick up ma from work. It's her early day.",
        "Edmund: All right. Well, I'll see that tammy gets home safely. And please give my regards to your mother.",
        "Joey: Thanks, I will.",
        "Sandy: Hey, joey, you mind dropping me off?",
        "Joey: No, not a problem at all. Thanks, edmund. It's been fun. Too bad lizzie wasn't here. It was our best rehearsal yet.",
        "Tammy: Now I really am worried about lizzie. She's never ditched us before. I wonder if everything's okay.",
        "Olivia: Tell me something.",
        "Beth: Olivia, I am trying to figure out where lizzie might have gone and what she might have been thinking.",
        "Olivia: Any brilliant ideas?",
        "Sam: Liv, don'T.",
        "Olivia: What? I'm sorry, I thought that actually coming to her mother might help, but I forgot she's as crazy as her kid.",
        "Lillian: Olivia, I know you are upset.",
        "Olivia: Upset? You think so?",
        "Lillian: Yes, I do, but there's no need... you're not going to accomplish anything by getting mad at beth.",
        "Olivia: You know what? You're right. This is a complete waste of time.",
        "Christopher: You know what? I've been encouraging lizzie to keep a journal of her feelings. Maybe she wrote something down that could be helpful.",
        "Lillian: I'm going to go to her room and check.",
        "Christopher: I'll follow you.",
        "Sam: Beth, when was the last time you saw lizzie?",
        "Beth: I saw her at breakfast, and she was fine.",
        "Olivia: She hasn't been fine in a long time. And the longer we stand here just twiddling our thumbs, the more danger my daughter is in.",
        "Sam: We're going to find her, liv.",
        "Beth: Olivia, if lizzie did take your baby, she wouldn't hurt her. I know that. She's emma's sister.",
        "Olivia: That doesn't matter. She tried it once before, beth. What's so different now? Let me tell you something. She has my daughter and if she does anything in any way to hurt her, I swear to you I will make her pay. (Baby crying)",
        "Lizzie: It's okay, honey. It's okay. This milk's better than mommy'S. I promise you. Oh. Come on. It's okay. I promise you. Oh, there we go. Yeah, see. (Baby crying) oh. Come on, this is good. Come on. There we go. There we go, come on. You've got to be a big girl for sissy. There we go. Be a big girl. No more crying fits, please.",
