        "Reva: What are you doing here?",
        "Josh: Well, I was wondering where I might find you, so I took a flyer on this place. How you doing, Billy.",
        "Billy: Yeah, I'm just fine.",
        "Josh: Good.",
        "Reva: Your instincts were right.",
        "Josh: Yes. Or I just got lucky.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: Hey, hey, where you going?",
        "Marina: Not very far since I don't have any clothes on.",
        "Alan-Michael: Good. That's just what I wanted to hear. ( Cell phone rings ) You were wrong.",
        "Alan: That's not the kind of greeting I was hoping for.",
        "Alan-Michael: Well in this case it's a good thing. I guess Gus didn't overhear you and Beth talking about my plans to take over Spaulding. Or if he did, he can't remember.",
        "Alan: What makes you say that?",
        "Alan-Michael: I ran into Gus last night. He didn't say a word about it.",
        "Alan: That doesn't prove anything.",
        "Alan-Michael: Come on. Gus is not exactly Mr. Subtle. If he so much as suspected that I was out to pull an Enron on Harley, he would have been all over me.",
        "Alan: The fact of the matter is you haven't made your move, Alan-Michael. And Harley is still CEO of Spaulding Enterprises and you're not.",
        "Marina: So, who was that?",
        "Alan-Michael: Nobody important.",
        "Marina: Mm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Well I don't know what everybody is talking about, I think the place looks good. It just needs a couple of touchups. ( Laughs )",
        "Harley: Well, this is going to be our first family project, whipping this place into shape.",
        "Gus: Yeah, it's a lot of work. A lot of work! But I think we're up to the task.",
        "Harley: All right, boys, do you remember where your bedrooms are?",
        "Gus: Uh-oh.",
        "Harley: Perfect!",
        "Gus: That way. ( Laughter )",
        "Harley: Well it won't be long before we're living here together here as a family.",
        "Gus: Yeah, family, together, that's what I'm talking about. Together.",
        "Harley: Mm-hmm. Where do we start?",
        "Zach: We can't fix the house; you guys have to go to work.",
        "Gus: It's funny that you say that. You know, Uncle Frank, he's been asking me to go back-- ooh-- back to the force.",
        "Harley: Yeah.",
        "Gus: So, I'm thinking-- I don't know.",
        "Harley: I have a lot of stuff I have to catch up on my job, too.",
        "Zach: I don't want you to go back to work.",
        "Harley: Well, it's okay because I love my job. It's fun. It's almost as fun as Gus is.",
        "Zach: But you guys are going to be gone again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: We both know what you want, and that's Harley.",
        "Mallet: Nope, not this time.",
        "Dinah: So how do I know, huh? How do I know you're not going to cheat on me the way you cheated on her. How can I ever trust you ever again?",
        "Mallet: Because it already happened, that's why. I slept with Harley. Hmm. Oh, easy. Oh, you're all elbows. (Dinah sighs ) Hey, what's wrong?",
        "Dinah: I was just thinking about last night.",
        "Mallet: Last night was amazing.",
        "Dinah: Before the amazing part.",
        "Mallet: Oh.",
        "Dinah: When I was ready to blow out of here and slice and dice Harley for sleeping with you.",
        "Mallet: You didn't, and that's a good thing.",
        "Dinah: I wanted to get it out, but I saw her and Gus standing there, and they were happy. And he's home and here you are with me. And all is good, you know.",
        "Mallet: Is it? Is it all good?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, you know. I mean, Harley's... Harley's coming back to work, and, um, you know, she's going to get things rolling and I'm going to be the dutiful assistant, where I belong. All is well with the world.",
        "Harley: Ooh, can you make those stay?",
        "Jude: Zach's taking them all.",
        "Harley: He's taking them all, I know. Okay, share with your brother. This is the best model ever. I can't wait to see it when you guys finish.",
        "Jude: Yeah.",
        "Harley: Be careful.",
        "Jude: We'll make a super house.",
        "Harley: Okay.",
        "Jude: Right, Zach?",
        "Zach: Mm-hm.",
        "Harley: Hey, you okay?",
        "Gus: I think Zach's upset.",
        "Harley: Well, maybe. It has been a rough few months.",
        "Gus: I know.",
        "Harley: I'd come home from being out looking for you all day, and there the kids would be looking up at me with those big eyes, okay, where are we today, Mommy, what's happening today?",
        "Gus: I think they need a little more stability. ( Laughter )",
        "Harley: Who doesn't?",
        "Gus: Yeah, but you know, this is the real world. Parents, adults, we've got to work, right?",
        "Harley: Yes, 16 hours a day, six days a week in our case.",
        "Gus: We'll have to make them understand that's the way it is.",
        "Harley: Do you think it is possible to make small children understand something like that.",
        "Gus: Ah, we can do it, you know. We've done this before. We were working crazy hours before, remember?",
        "Harley: Well that's before you went missing for months. These kids aren't just looking for us to spend more time with them. They're thinking every time we walk out of the door, we're not coming back, and who can blame them? Look at the close calls they've had. And I've got to tell you, they're not the only ones itching to be a real family again.",
        "Gus: What are you getting at?",
        "Harley: I'm getting at I don't want to work 16 hours a day anymore. I don't want to be away from you like that. I barely want to be away from you at all.",
        "Gus: You want to quit your job?",
        "Harley: I'm hardly there anyway.",
        "Gus: I thought you loved your job.",
        "Harley: I do. I just love my husband and my children more. When I started working there, I really felt like I was the only person who could whip that company into shape, but now, I tell you, I look at Dinah and Alan-Michael and they're doing fine-- more than fine. They're doing great. And they're not married; they don't have kids. Let them put in the long hours.",
        "Gus: Seems like you gave this a lot of thought.",
        "Harley: Sort of, I have, but you know, what Zach just said, it crystallized it for me.",
        "Gus: How?",
        "Harley: It is time for somebody else to head Spaulding Enterprises, permanently.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Oh, I have to go. I'm sorry. I promised Harley I'd watch the boys. ( Cell phone ringing )",
        "Alan-Michael: Hey, Harley.",
        "Harley: Alan-Michael, I scheduled a meeting of the board for later today.",
        "Alan-Michael: Why?",
        "Harley: To announce that I'm stepping down as CEO of Spaulding Enterprises. That means that the board's going to have to vote again. And Dinah's been doing such a great job, I think they'll probably vote to keep her in permanently, don't you? Alan-Michael?",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm here. Yeah, sure. I'm sure they will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: I got an e-mail from Shayne; I thought you might want to see it?",
        "Reva: Oh, good. How is he?",
        "Josh: Well, I don't know. I had Wanda print it up. I thought maybe we could read it together.",
        "Reva: Well let's see it.",
        "Billy: I'm going to be heading out right now, so--.",
        "Reva: Oh, okay. Well you just go ahead, and I'll see you later.",
        "Billy: Okay, great.",
        "Josh: I'll see you later, Billy.",
        "Reva: Why don't I whip up a couple of drinks, what do you say?",
        "Josh: That would be lovely. Thank you.",
        "Reva: A bloody mary sounds good, huh? That's one of the perks of having a son who owns the joint, right? (Laughs ) There you go.",
        "Josh: Thank you, sweetie.",
        "Reva: Okay, let's see it.",
        "Josh: All right here we go.",
        "Reva: ( Laughing ) That's so Shayne.",
        "Josh: Very funny. He's a funny writer.",
        "Reva: Yeah.",
        "Josh: You reading this section here?",
        "Reva: Yeah. Well I mean, I knew he was going to be upset that we were separated, but... oh. But all in all, it sounds good.",
        "Josh: Yeah. I just wish he said something about coming home, that's all.",
        "Reva: I know, me, too.",
        "Josh: So...?",
        "Reva: So, did you chase me all over town just to show me this?",
        "Josh: Yes, as a matter of fact I did. I know things have been a little tough with Jonathan lately, and I thought it might be a good thing to remind you there are some good things about parenting, too.",
        "Reva: Thank you. You know this whole time I've been trying to figure out how to deal with Jonathan, it reminded me what it must have been like for you, you know, having to raise Marah and Shayne all by yourself. I mean, the pressure of that, trying to figure out if you're handling things the right way.",
        "Josh: Well, you're doing the best you can do, and nobody can ask more of that from you, so... listen, about Jonathan...",
        "Reva: No.",
        "Josh: No, no, no. No, no. I was going to say, if you need help with him at all, you just don't have to do everything on your own, you know. I mean, he's your son, but there has been a lot going on for you lately, and I just don't think you should have to shoulder everything on your own.",
        "Reva: Well, that's nice, Joshua. That's very nice. Cheers. ( Laughs )",
        "Josh: Cheers. Ooh, very nice.",
        "Reva: Thank you.",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Reva: It's just this. You know, this, us, here, having a nice, quiet drink together. It seems so odd, nice and simple, just like everybody-- ( gasps ) Oh, I am so, so sorry.",
        "Patron: Bitch.",
        "Reva: What did you just call me?",
        "Josh: Oh, this is great. Just when everything was starting to get boring. ( Laughs )",
        "Josh: Okay, okay, okay. You know what, just walk away.",
        "Patron: Huh?",
        "Josh: No, trust me, okay. It was an accident; walk away right now.",
        "Patron: Well maybe I don't feel like it.",
        "Reva: Oh, come on! Bring on more name calling; it makes you feel like such a big man, huh?",
        "Patron: You ought to watch your mouth, lady!",
        "Josh: Hey, you know what? Let's just not do this, okay. I mean, come on.",
        "Patron: What, you worried I might hit a chick?",
        "Josh: No, actually, I'm more worried about the chick hitting you. Just go...",
        "Reva: No, I'm not going to touch him, Joshua unless I'm wearing gloves!",
        "Josh: Just stop, okay.",
        "Patron: Out of my way, old man.",
        "Josh: Excuse me, what did you call me?",
        "Reva: Joshua...",
        "Josh: Yeah, I've got a pretty good right for an old man, don't I?",
        "Reva: No, no, no. That's not what I'm talking about.",
        "Josh: How are you doing?",
        "Reva: We should probably get out of here.",
        "Josh: Pull me out of here. You want a piece of me? You want a piece of me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Hi. I'm going to have... I'm not going to have anything. Thanks. Nothing, nope.",
        "Alvarez: Hey, Billy, how goes it?",
        "Billy: Pretty good, how about you?",
        "Alvarez: Busy. It seems like everyone needs a lawyer these days.",
        "Billy: Yeah, yeah. Well take care, Mike.",
        "Alvarez: Hey, speaking of legal matters, I guess Josh and Reva reconciled?",
        "Billy: Oh, yeah? Well how do you figure that?",
        "Alvarez: Josh had me draw up some preliminary divorce papers a couple months back. He was pretty upset about it at the time, but he never called me about those papers, so I just assumed that things were looking up for him and Reva. Am I wrong?",
        "Billy: Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, you're way wrong. Oh, they're going to need those papers real soon. Yeah, mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: You know, a lot has gone on between you and Harley and me.",
        "Dinah: You think?",
        "Mallet: Can't live with working under her now that...",
        "Dinah: Now that I know she's been working under you? I'm sorry. Mallet, I'm sorry. This is a lot. It's a lot to process, you know. Just... I'm trying here to get my mind around this. I know that Harley was grieving, and she wasn't in her right mind, but this is hard for me.",
        "Mallet: I'm sorry. I'm sorry I have to put you through this.",
        "Dinah: I had everything, you know. I had it; I had it. I had a dedicated guy...",
        "Mallet: Hey. Hey, hey, I'm still dedicated to you. I'm dedicated.",
        "Dinah: And a job. A job that I loved, that made me feel important, that made me number one, made me feel wanted and needed.",
        "Mallet: You just want that feeling to last a little longer?",
        "Dinah: ( Laughing ) Yeah. Yeah, I mean is that so terrible, to want to imagine...",
        "Mallet: Imagine what?",
        "Dinah: A future, a future, you know that it could handle. It could--",
        "Mallet: I can imagine that, can you? I can imagine that?",
        "Dinah: Yes. Yes, but sometimes it is just easier to, I don't know, dream instead of seeing what's really right in front of you. I... I'm not going to go there. I'm not gonna focus on you and Harley because that's over, it's done, you know. And I am on to the next step of my fabulous journey, you know. I mean... I'm over and done with at Spaulding and despite the fact that I have completely outperformed everybody there, that I worked harder than anybody there. I was in early, and I was out late, but you know what? Harley gets what she wants when she wants it. ( Knock on the door )",
        "Harley: Hi.",
        "Dinah: Hi.",
        "Harley: Can I come in?",
        "Dinah: Sure, yeah. Come on in.",
        "Harley: Hey.",
        "Mallet: Hey. What's up.",
        "Harley: So I called a special meeting of the Spaulding board for today. It will be at Towers, so it's a little less formal.",
        "Dinah: Oh, good. Good, good, good. You're making decisions from the start. That's good, that's good. Come on in. Come in. Can get you a cup of coffee? Or have a seat. I kept the bed warm for you. That's what I do best.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Alan-Michael.",
        "Alan-Michael: Are you following me?",
        "Alan: Perhaps I should. I assume that you've heard that Harley's called for an emergency board meeting.",
        "Alan-Michael: She's going to announce that she's leaving the company for good. She told me so herself.",
        "Alan: Really? Well then, I'm assume after the announcement, they will uh, have a vote to install the next CEO?",
        "Alan-Michael: That is the way we work things at Spaulding. I've been making a few calls. I think you can just call me boss.",
        "Alan: You sure of that?",
        "Alan-Michael: The old guard has been waiting for a chance to vote me in. I kept up the pretense with Harley and Dinah not being interested in the job, but I'll get voted in anyway. The result: Harley's gone and Dinah will be eased out without me ever having to get my hands dirty.",
        "Alan: And you will never have to tell your little girlfriend that you've been trying to take the company away from her Aunt Harley ever since you got to town.",
        "Alan-Michael: Like I said before, I can still have everything I want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Harley!",
        "Gus: Nope. Nobody here but us chickens.",
        "Marina: It is still surprising to see you. It's good, but surprising.",
        "Gus: That's good. That's good.",
        "Marina: So, where are Harley and the boys? I was supposed to meet them here.",
        "Gus: Really? Well, she must have forgotten because she took the kids over to Rick's. She's on her way over to Towers to make her big announcement, the show. I don't know, you know when she gets her mind going, there's nothing stopping her.",
        "Marina: Makes up her mind about what?",
        "Gus: She's stepping down as CEO permanently.",
        "Marina: Really?",
        "Gus: Right, so she's going to go over to Towers. They're having a little board meeting and they're going to name her replacement permanently.",
        "Marina: Wow. Is this a good thing?",
        "Gus: Yes, she wants to spend more time with me and the kids.",
        "Marina: That's great for you. I'm happy for you-- for both of you. And, gosh, the boys must be thrilled.",
        "Gus: Yeah, well that's the general idea.",
        "Marina: Well, who does she think they're going to vote in to take her place, Dinah?",
        "Gus: Yeah, I think she wants Dinah. Why, do you think my brother wants to run the show?",
        "Marina: You've got a problem with Alan-Michael, Gus? You don't even know him.",
        "Gus: No, I didn't mean anything by it.",
        "Marina: I'm sorry, it's just... I'm sure Harley told you how much he tried to help her while you were missing. I mean, not just at the office, but actually trying to find you he gave her that note that you wrote.",
        "Gus: What note?",
        "Marina: You know the letter that you wrote about-- when you thought you were dying and for her to move on. What?",
        "Gus: I didn't write a note.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liz Keifer, \"Inside The Light.\" At the end of the day, I am very happy and I like who I am. And I think at the end of the day, Blake probably feels guilty for something she did or didn't do. I think people would be surprised to learn that I can be very shy. See Blake, Wednesday, April 5, \"Inside The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: So, what brings you by?",
        "Harley: Well, I wanted to talk to you about the job.",
        "Dinah: I am very happy for you. I'm absolutely thrilled and delighted that you are back in charge. And I tell you, I am happy that you are able to kiss this entire nightmare with Gus good-bye, and you are ready to take on the challenge of doing what you do quite well.",
        "Harley: Dinah, let me just--",
        "Dinah: Honey, listen, I called over there and asked them to go ahead and clear the desk, get things ready for the new team, and you know-- do you want coffee? Do you want something to drink? What can I do? Can I get you some fruit, some juices? Do you want soy milk? I can go ahead and get that for you.",
        "Mallet: Dinah, I think that she's trying to tell you something.",
        "Dinah: I also had a thought-- boom-- you know, if you need some help, if you need some help returning some phone calls, I can go ahead and do that, you know. Hello; good-bye. She's in town; she's out of town.",
        "Harley: Dinah! I'm giving up the job.",
        "Dinah: Oh, okay. What?",
        "Harley: I'm resigning as CEO, effective immediately. After I do it-- today, now. I'm walking away for good, okay. Which means they will have to vote in someone new, which will hopefully be the person that I think is perfect for the job, which is you.",
        "Mallet: Wow, that's a \"no\" on the soy milk.",
        "Harley: What's with soy milk?",
        "Dinah: I don't know what to say.",
        "Harley: Hopefully after all this, you'll say yes.",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Yeah, I'll take it.",
        "Harley: Oh, good. Yay! Oh, I'm so happy. Oh, it's so good you feel glad about all this stuff. It's so good. It's so good. Okay, so...",
        "Dinah: It's so good.",
        "Harley: Yeah, it's at Towers later today. You should show up. And don't change your clothes; you look great.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I guess I should be there.",
        "Harley: You should definitely be there.",
        "Mallet: Harley, are you going over there now?",
        "Harley: No, I have a few more stops that I have to make, actually.",
        "Mallet: Okay, I was just going to-- can I talk to you for a second?",
        "Harley: Sure.",
        "Dinah: Honey, actually, you know what? I know that we're probably-- there is so much to prepare for this, I think it's best to go ahead and let Harley prepare her speech and get those things done. And handle it later. Go, go, go!",
        "Mallet: All right, I'll see you later.",
        "Harley: Okay. Bye, you guys.",
        "Dinah: Okay, great. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. ( Lauging )",

        "Alan: Are you sure that you have enough board votes?",
        "Alan-Michael: I wouldn't be feeling so good if this weren't in the bag.",
        "Alan: Well, that's nice to hear, but by my calculation, the vote could as easily go to Dinah Marler than you.",
        "Alan-Michael: Well, I calculate differently.",
        "Alan: Yeah, you always have. So you're telling me that the outcome of this could be decided on a single vote. There's not much of a comfort margin there.",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm not worried.",
        "Alan: You might be worried if you knew who's vote it is. Speaking of the devil.",
        "Beth: Hello, Alan. Alan-Michael.",
        "Alan-Michael: Beth. You know about the meeting, don't you?",
        "Beth: Yes, I do. I also know that my vote could decide whether you or Dinah is CEO. Kind of ironic, don't you think?",
        "Alan-Michael: Is it?",
        "Beth: Considering when you came back to town, I was pushed out of Spaulding. Now I'm in the position to return the favor. It seems I have more power than people thought. Oh, relax. When there are children to be protected, family always comes first. Isn't that right, Alan? ( Laughs )",

        "Gus: I don't think your boyfriend's home.",
        "Marina: Yeah, well it's too bad, because I really wanted to get this taken care of. ( Knocks on the door )",
        "Gus: So I just want to reiterate, I did not write that note.",
        "Marina: Not that you remember. But it is possible that you forgot. You said yourself that you were practically delirious after the accident.",
        "Gus: No, no, no. I only don't remember a couple of days.",
        "Marina: Well, see. There, there. You can't be sure. Besides, it would make perfect sense for you to write a note to Harley, especially if you thought you were never going to speak to her again.",
        "Gus: This note was found at the lake?",
        "Marina: Uh-huh. Someone found it over by where they found your wedding ring and your jacket, then they turned it in to someone at the inn, who called Alan-Michael.",
        "Gus: I see. So, he's the one that gave it to Alan-Michael.",
        "Marina: Actually, he thought that someone might be squeezing Harley for money, so he sent Harley and Mallet up to check out the whole thing, and when Harley read the letter, she I.D.'d it as your writing.",
        "Gus: And I'm-- you know, in this note, I'm supposedly saying to her that I think she should move on.",
        "Marina: It was really hard for Harley to read, but she was definitely looking for some kind of closure.",
        "Gus: Where's the note now?",
        "Marina: I don't know.",
        "Gus: I've got to go over to this board meeting. You want to go? I was thinking of going, having some fun, even getting some popcorn?",
        "Marina: No thanks, go ahead. I actually think I'm going to stay here and write Alan-Michael a little note.",
        "Gus: All right. I hope you remember your note after you write it.",

        "Billy: Um, these are the divorce papers?",
        "Alvarez: Yeah, but I haven't heard from Josh, so I just assumed--",
        "Billy: Whoa... I'll give it to him. I mean, he's so stressed with this family thing, with Reva and everything that, you know...",
        "Alvarez: I'm so sorry to hear that they couldn't work things out?",
        "Billy: Oh, yeah. Me, too. You know, I have a feeling that Josh thinks these divorce papers might just help everybody get on with their lives. ( Engine running )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I think we shook them.",
        "Josh: Yeah, I think so. Can you do me a favor? Then next time you want to throw a drink on a guy, can you make it an accountant maybe or a... anything but a biker or a member of a gang?",
        "Reva: Come on, what kind of fun would that be?",
        "Josh: Fun, Reva. You know what, this is not my idea of fun. I wouldn't call this fun.",
        "Reva: Yes, you would.",
        "Josh: Okay, maybe you're right. But the question is how did this happen? I mean it took about, what, 30 seconds for us to go from dead calm to complete chaos.",
        "Reva: Oh, if you want neat, quiet and clean, go to the library, but I don't think that's what you want. I think you love it when things are all stirred up and juicy. Am I wrong?",
        "Josh: ( Laughing )",
        "Reva: Well, am I wrong?",
        "Josh: No, you're not wrong. ( Reva snapping her fingers )",
        "Reva: Hey.",
        "Josh: Huh?",
        "Reva: Are you happy? I mean, I know since we went our separate ways, you've been trying to sort things out. I mean you're dating and you're trying to live your life uncomplicated, but are you happy?",
        "Josh: I don't know. I'm not, um, unhappy.",
        "Reva: Meaning what? You're not out and out miserable?",
        "Josh: Well, I certainly was. I mean when we first started falling apart, when we were going after each other all of the time and I never knew what to expect, but am I miserable now? No. Am I happy? Ah... you mean like can't wait to get out of bed and start my day kind of happy? No. But maybe that's not the way it's supposed to be.",
        "Reva: Maybe. Maybe not.",
        "Josh: I don't think our biker friends are coming back. Do you want to get a bite to eat?",
        "Reva: Sure.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Alexandra: Then dead silence from the husband and the wife. Neither one could defend themselves. (Laughter) Well, it's a big deal, right? It's not every day that a Spaulding CEO drops out, voluntarily.",
        "Harley: Well, it's good we have a top-flight, next-in-line with hands-on experience.",
        "Alexandra: Really, spare me the sales pitch, Harley.",
        "Harley: What, Dinah's doing a great job. Profits are up; stock prices are up. What's going on with you? You're not actually thinking of this job yourself, are you? You'll never get voted in at this point, Alex.",
        "Alexandra: At this point, well, how kind of you to be pointing that out. You know, I really don't understand you lobbying so profusely for this woman. There doesn't seem to be much competition.",
        "Harley: Nothing's safe with Alan around.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, well, I wouldn't worry about Alan.",

        "Dinah: Okay, is there a copy of the quarterly projection in every board members file? Good. And my mission statement, I hope is in there.",
        "Jason: Yes, Ms. Marler. Everything's been done to your specifications.",
        "Dinah: Okay. Thanks, Jason. Okay, bye-bye. What are you grinning at?",
        "Mallet: I'm not grinning. I'm actually like squinting. I don't understand what half this stuff means. ( Dinah laughs ) No, I'm grinning. I'm kind of getting a kick out of watching you take charge. You know, but I've got to say, you checking to make sure everybody's folder's got the right stuff in it, you don't need to be doing that stuff now. That's strictly grunt stuff. You are corner office material.",
        "Dinah: Shut up.",
        "Mallet: You're going to be impossible to live with, you know that right?",
        "Dinah: Well I'm sure I'll allocate some time to be with you.",
        "Mallet: No, that's not what I mean. See, once you get elected, you're head's going to swell up like some king of sick August watermelon and you're not going to be able to squeeze in the bedroom door.",
        "Dinah: Okay, well I'm going to have to meet you in the kitchen.",
        "Mallet: Do you promise?",
        "Dinah: I promise you. I'm going to say hello to some new arrivals.",

        "Alan-Michael: I'm trying not to, why?",
        "Gus: He's probably smoking a victory cigar knowing that Harley's going to step down.",
        "Alan-Michael: Maybe. The luckiest guy and the room's got to be you. Now you've got Harley all to yourself.",
        "Gus: Hmm.",
        "Alan-Michael: Congratulations.",
        "Gus: Thank you.",
        "Alan-Michael: CEO isn't a job for anybody who has a family at home and people at home to love.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Don't do this, Marina. Just turn around and walk out the door. Let it go. I can't. I had this same gut feeling about Baby Hope, and I was right. I don't care how out of it you were, Gus, you would have remembered writing that note-- if you wrote it.",

        "Josh: Reva, wait a minute. I have no idea--",
        "Reva: No! No, no, no. Don't try to deny it. I mean, your name is right there on the line where it says plaintiff. It didn't just get there by accident.",
        "Josh: Reva, I can explain this, okay?",
        "Reva: Oh, yeah? Explain it to the judge.",

        "Harley: No, don't bother. Alan, yeah he's not on the board, but Beth is. And if you try to throw her out, she's going to make a big scene. In a few minutes, I'm going to be out of Spaulding, anyway, which is what he's wanted all along.",
        "Gus: He's not crazy about Dinah, so...",
        "Harley: Well, you can't have everything you want.",
        "Gus: Ooh, don't tell him that. All right, knock 'em dead. ( Whispers ) You look great.",
        "Harley: Ladies and gentlemen, if I could have your attention, please. Take your seats. Make yourselves comfortable. A lot of rumors have been flying around today about why I called this meeting. I am here to confirm them. I am, in fact, stepping down as CEO of Spaulding Enterprises as of this moment. I do want to make it clear that I'm leaving for personal reasons. I couldn't have been happier with the job itself, really. And I hope you've been equally contented with my performance... ( applause ) The grudging applause. Now granted, it will be hard for any one person to take my place, but it's not impossible. In fact, Spaulding is in luck because today at this meeting, you have the opportunity to vote for an individual who has already proven herself a dynamic and capable leader by doing a wonderful job of running the company in my absence. So as my last act as CEO, I ask the board to vote for progress, profit and a brighter future. I ask you to vote for Dinah Marler. ( Applause )",

        "Gus: What is it?",
        "Marina: It's the note that you wrote for Harley.",
        "Gus: It looks like my handwriting, but it's not.",
        "Marina: Yeah, well how about... oh, this one? Also, right? Because if you keep practicing, it starts to look a little more familiar. And you keep working at it, and working at it, and finally you go from a rough draft to the final copy of what is almost a perfect match of Gus Aitoro's handwriting.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: When I call your name, please cast your vote. Alexandra Spaulding.",
        "Alexandra: I vote for Alan-Michael Spaulding.",
        "Harley: One vote, Alan-Michael Spaulding.",
        "Alan: You're next.",
        "Marina: Trust me. I would like to bring something to everyone's attention-- actually, it's more like a question.",
        "Alan: What now?",
        "Gus: Let's hear what the lady has to say.",
        "Marina: You know that note you got from Gus, the one that Alan-Michael said that the fisherman found? He was lying. He actually wrote that letter. Which means that he was lying about a whole bunch of things, like wanting to help you, Harley, with Gus and with Spaulding. In fact, I'm not sure that he ever wanted to help you at all. I think he's always just wanted the company. So he's been lying to us all. Isn't that right?",
