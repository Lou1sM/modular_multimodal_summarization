        "carrie: Did she... Oh... Oh, did maryanne speak to you?",
        "Reva: No. She never spoke.",
        "Carrie: Oh. Oh, I'm so sorry. What a pity because, you see, she had... She had such a beautiful voice.",
        "Reva: No, you stay awake. You stay awake. Harley's going to be back here soon and she's going to bring help and you have to tell them what you just told me to help marah.",
        "Carrie: Yes. To help marah. To help marah.",
        "Reva: Oh, my god. Maybe harley has some water in her bag. You have to stay alive. You have to stay alive to help her. Oh.",
        "Carrie: For marah.",
        "Marah: I can't lose him.",
        "Jeffrey: You shouldn't be here, josh.",
        "Josh: Well, neither should you. Any word?",
        "Jeffrey: Nothing. Doris wolfe is still in there with the grand jury. How's marah holding up?",
        "Josh: She's calm. And I don't know what that means. I can't imagine how she's going to react if they hand down an indictment. I just...",
        "Jeffrey: She's strong, josh.",
        "Josh: Yeah, well, i keep trying to tell myself that, you know? She's a fighter, she's strong, all that stuff, but I... I'm not sure i believe it anymore. I've been watching her, you know, what she's been going through for these last... I think it's just tearing her apart every single day.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, carrie set out to hurt her and she did a hell of a job.",
        "Reva: Carrie. Maryanne. It's time, isn't it? You want me to do something. What is it? Just tell me what you want me to do.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. So, um, I fed you, i cleaned you. Now what do you want to do, huh? I guess you're a little too young for tv, huh. (Laughs) it's okay. Yes. How about I tell you a story? Would that be okay? Daddy used to always tell me stories. Okay. So, once upon a time, there was this perfect baby. And she was forced to live with this evil witch, who i'd like to call olivia. And then all of a sudden, this beautiful princess named lizzie came and rescued the baby and they both went back to the king's house and they lived happily ever after. And that is exactly what's going to happen to you, sweetheart. As soon as daddy comes back, we're going to live happily ever after.",
        "Olivia: You should have seen this coming. You could have stopped her.",
        "Beth: Olivia, you need to calm down.",
        "Olivia: Don't tell me to calm down. Not when that psycho you call your daughter has my baby.",
        "Alan: What's going on here?",
        "Olivia: Your granddaughter took my baby.",
        "Alan: Your baby?",
        "Lillian: Olivia just told us that her baby and phillip's is alive.",
        "Alan: Olivia, you lied about losing phillip's child?",
        "Olivia: You understand this! She has my baby and she's sick and she's dangerous and all of you helped to make her that way! Now this is on you, alan. You find my baby and you bring her to me! Do you understand me? I don't care what you have to do, you find her!",
        "alan: Don't try to lay this on us, olivia. If we had known phillip's child was alive...",
        "Olivia: She's my child, too, alan.",
        "Alan: Listen to me. If we had known, we could have been watching elizabeth.",
        "Olivia: No, you wouldn't have been watching her.",
        "Alan: Can you imagine how she felt when she found out her only sister was alive?",
        "Olivia: Oh, stop it. Stop apologizing for her. I don't feel sorry for lizzie.",
        "Alan: Have you contacted the police?",
        "Olivia: I called the police; they called the fbi. They're so caught up in red tape right now.",
        "Alan: All right. All right, i'm going to call gus.",
        "Olivia: Gus?",
        "Alan: Yes.",
        "Olivia: Oh, why not bring another spaulding into the mix? I'm sure while he's keeping hush-hush for your benefit, lizzie's skipping the country with my kid.",
        "Alan: Olivia, he will do everything he can to find elizabeth and... What's my new grandchild's name?",
        "Olivia: Emma.",
        "Alan: Emma. I will use all of my resources to find her. I promise.",
        "Olivia: I'm sure you'll use all of your resources to protect you and lizzie and the rest of your clan, but the only thing i care about right now is my daughter.",
        "Alan: Come on, gus. Pick up, pick up. (Cell phone ringing)",
        "dealer: You going to get that?",
        "Gus: No, it can wait.",
        "Dealer: What if it's your boys from the precinct checking up? (Laughs) no, I'm just messing with you, man. All right, we're good.",
        "Gus: All right. Well, if this is any good, i'll be back.",
        "Dealer: Got another shipment coming in next week.",
        "Gus: Cool. (Cell phone ringing)",
        "dealer: I'll see you next week then.",
        "Gus: All right. Later. What?",
        "Alan: Gus? I have a problem.",
        "Gus: What kind of problem?",
        "Alan: A big one and i need your help.",
        "Rick: Harley, let me get this straight. These tunnels... These tunnels, they really exist? I mean, you know i don't like tunnels.",
        "Harley: Yeah, well, i'm warning you now, they're pretty slippery, so if you fall behind, I'm leaving you. (Laughter) just kidding.",
        "Rick: Why doesn't that surprise me?",
        "Harley: Thank you for doing this. I really appreciate it.",
        "Rick: I didn't know i had a choice.",
        "Harley: Well, you didn'T. But thank you anyway.",
        "Rick: All right, this is just a medical situation, right? Nothing more than that.",
        "Harley: Of course. Why?",
        "Rick: Because i'm tired, harley. Everybody around me is having a nervous breakdown, my wife just had a baby, that's why. I'm tired.",
        "Harley: I know, and i'm so psyched for you. And I'm psyched for jude. He's going to love having a little sister. What's her name again?",
        "Rick: We haven't come up with one yet.",
        "Harley: Right.",
        "Rick: See, if i was with my wife, we'd probably come up with a name. But I'm not with my wife; I'm here. And then, remember you lectured me about spending bonding time with jude?",
        "Harley: Don't worry about jude. Jude is fine. He's with frank.",
        "Rick: Is frank the father? I'm the father. Remember, you lecturing me about that?",
        "Harley: I'll help you. I owe you, right?",
        "Rick: Oh, that's my name. I owe you. I owe you, rick.",
        "Harley: Okay, fine, look, let's just get out of here because the sooner we get down there, the sooner we can get carrie out of the caves, the sooner we can get marah out of this mess and the sooner you can name your baby. Okay?",
        "Rick: Um, how far do we have to go into this tunnel? Because I'm really claustrophobic.",
        "Harley: Okay, don't panic, okay? I'll be with you.",
        "Rick: You're not going to leave me?",
        "Harley: No, i won't leave you.",
        "Rick: Okay. Because I don't like tunnels.",
        "Sandy: I'll bet that will make for some interesting reading.",
        "Tammy: You're a funny guy.",
        "Sandy: Yes, i am. But I'm here for business. I'm trying to set up our last week of rehearsals, now that we've finally rescheduled our performance dates.",
        "Tammy: We need it, because i think we have a huge disaster on our hands with this play. I don't see how we're going to be able to pull it all together. I don't think joey understands how important this is.",
        "Sandy: Joey will get back in the swing of things. He's romeo. He has no choice.",
        "Tammy: You think he will? I don'T. The minute he found out we had to postpone this play, it was like he forgot the whole thing. \"Romeo and who?\" And now it's all about baseball. And then there's lizzie, and who knows where her head is these days. Romeo and the nurse have gone awol.",
        "Sandy: Leave lizzie to me. It'll be my pleasure to straighten her out. As for joey, he can concentrate on baseball after the play is over. I'll have a talk with him. I'll tell him, \"hey, lupo, make a choice: Kissing fair juliet or hanging out with sweaty guys on a baseball diamond.\"",
        "Shayne: Well, who says he can't have both?",
        "Sandy: A switch-hitting romeo?",
        "Marina: Why not? They both wear funny pants.",
        "Shayne: Ha-ha.",
        "Marina: It always worked for shayne.",
        "Shayne: Oh, thank you, babe. So, what's up? What's up with this play? Are we ever going to see this thing or what?",
        "Tammy: I didn't know you were so interested in shakespeare.",
        "Shayne: Actually, i'm not. I'm just trying to support my little cousin's stage debut, you see.",
        "Tammy: Thank you.",
        "Shayne: You're welcome.",
        "Sandy: Actually, we've just gotten new performance dates, so you better get tickets while you can.",
        "Marina: I could help you run lines, if you want. I mean, I'm just kind of hanging out, so it would be fun.",
        "Sandy: No need. Tammy here has a really fancy acting coach: Good old prince edmund himself.",
        "Marina: That is great. Edmund is hot.",
        "Tammy: He is, isn't he? (Laughter)",
        "shayne: Oh, he's hot, huh?",
        "Tammy: Yeah, and he's been a total lifesaver these past few months. He's the only person in the whole world who understands what this play means to me.",
        "Sandy: Oh, I'm glad somebody does. (Pager beeps)",
        "marina: Is that your dad?",
        "Shayne: Nope. It's just remy. My dad promised he'd call and say what's going on with marah but nothing yet.",
        "Tammy: Marah's going to be okay, isn't she? My mom keeps saying this is all going to go away.",
        "Shayne: That's what we're hoping. I just wish he'd call.",
        "Josh: So, when the grand jury takes this long, is that usually a good thing or a bad thing?",
        "Jeffrey: It's impossible to call, josh. It could go either way.",
        "Josh: Well, i can't even believe it's gone this far. She had to fire that weapon. Anyone can see that.",
        "Jeffrey: Anyone except marah.",
        "Josh: Yeah, that's kind of the same thing that tony santos said after he saw her.",
        "Jeffrey: Tony santos? Josh, I don't think it's a good idea for marah to be hanging out with anyone with the name of santos.",
        "Josh: If you're worried about bad publicity, i think it's a little late in the game.",
        "Ross: Jeffrey. Are they still in there?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, they're still in there.",
        "Ross: Usually the grand jury wraps it up about this time, unless they're going to take the case into tomorrow.",
        "Josh: No. They can't possibly carry this thing over for another day. They can't do that.",
        "Ross: Josh, they could take it for another full day, yes.",
        "Doris: Good evening, gentlemen. The grand jury has handed down an indictment.",
        "Jeffrey: (Groans)",
        "doris: Your client, marah lewis, will stand trial for murder. As soon as a court date is assigned...",
        "Josh: No! No, no! No, you cannot do this! I'm not going to let you do this!",
        "Reva: What is it, maryanne? Tell me. Tell me what it is.",
        "Harley: Reva? Can you hear us?",
        "Rick: Take it easy.",
        "Harley: Slow.",
        "Reva: (Groaning)",
        "rick: We found you unconscious. Do you remember what happened?",
        "Reva: No. Oh.",
        "Harley: (Gasps)",
        "reva: What's back there?",
        "Rick: You've got a really nasty lump back there. Could be a concussion.",
        "Reva: Carrie?",
        "Rick: Take it easy.",
        "Reva: Oh, my god. Oh, my god, where is she? Where did she go? Is carrie gone? I mean, harley, you saw her.",
        "Rick: Reva, i want you to stay still. Are you dizzy or nauseous?",
        "Reva: No, rick, i'm angry. I don't even remember what happened. I mean, one second i was getting water out of the bag and then the minute i turned my back, she... (Sighs)",
        "harley: She must have hit you with this.",
        "Rick: All right. We need to get you to the hospital right away.",
        "Reva: No, no. I'm not going anywhere until we find carrie. You know, she can't be far. That \"poor me\" act was exactly that. It was an act. But that wound was real. Harley, we saw the blood.",
        "Harley: I know, but she knows these tunnels so well, she could be anywhere by now.",
        "Reva: So we'll split up. You know? Whoever finds her first...",
        "Harley: You need to calm down. The important thing is you're okay.",
        "Reva: No. The important thing is we find carrie. Otherwise her confession means nothing.",
        "Harley: Wait, what confession?",
        "Reva: Her confession. She confessed to everything. To setting up the men. To the drugs. She said she either wanted to hurt them or frame them for her murder-- not that doris wolfe is going to believe any of that, especially coming from me. What? What are you smiling about? We can't prove carrie's alive.",
        "Harley: Oh, reva. Maybe we can.",
        "Josh: What the hell is the matter with you? Do you have no sense of justice at all?",
        "Jeffrey: Josh.",
        "Josh: My daughter had no choice but to fire that gun and you know it. If she didn't, i'd be dead right now. She'd be dead. My brother would be gone right now.",
        "Ross: We'll handle this in court.",
        "Josh: She should not have to stand trial!",
        "Ross: Josh!",
        "Josh: Her life has been destroyed, but that's not enough for you, is it?",
        "Doris: You know what, ross?",
        "Josh: Is it?",
        "Doris: I'd take mr. Lewis home before he does something he'll regret.",
        "Josh: Who the hell do you think you are? My daughter's not a murderer!",
        "Jeffrey: Josh! Josh!",
        "Josh: Do you hear me? She is not a murderer!",
        "Jeffrey: Calm down!",
        "Tammy: Is marah at the courthouse?",
        "Shayne: She only has to go there when it's a trial.",
        "Marina: And that's why we came here, to keep our minds off things. So, I hear that you are really into this theater thing. You know, it's great to have something at school that you really care about. Like shayne did, when he played ball.",
        "Tammy: Shayne, I miss watching you play. Remember when you used to let me play catch with you when nobody else was around?",
        "Shayne: Mmm. Yeah, I doubt that you'd be caught dead playing catch with me now. You'd be too worried about messing up your manicure or breaking a nail or something.",
        "Tammy: True. But I wish i could watch you play.",
        "Shayne: Well, you never know. I'm feeling stronger every day. Feeling better.",
        "Sandy: That's true. And he better start playing ball again soon because he's no poker player. (Laughter)",
        "shayne: Thanks.",
        "Sandy: You're welcome. What about you, marina? What's your passion? What are you dying to do?",
        "Shayne: Actually, marina's life is completely fulfilled at this point because she's with me. So...",
        "Sandy: Ah. But for real?",
        "Marina: (Laughs) that's a good question. I wanted to do the theater thing when i first started at springfield high, but then stuff kept happening-- life stuff-- kept me from having the time to really go for it. It's a big commitment.",
        "Tammy: It is.",
        "Marina: And then I barely started classes at springfield u....",
        "Shayne: She barely started classes before ben started controlling her life and messed it all up.",
        "Marina: It was just one thing after another until I dropped out last semester.",
        "Sandy: So, do you want to go back?",
        "Shayne: Of course she does. We're going to... We're going to be able to start out again together. After this whole mess with marah, then marina and i are going to be able to have a normal life together.",
        "Sandy: Maybe then you can find your passion.",
        "Marina: Maybe. I hope so.",
        "Sandy: Any word?",
        "Shayne: No. No, not yet.",
        "Marina: I just want all of this to be over. Marah has been through more than any of us. I just don't know how much more she can take.",
        "Sandy: I know. I know. And it's tough not being able to help her.",
        "Tammy: Sandy likes to help people. That's his passion.",
        "Sandy: Where'd you get that from?",
        "Tammy: I see it. You're sort of like edmund in that way.",
        "Marina: So it runs in the family, huh? Well, good. Now I know who i can turn to when i need to figure out what the heck my next step is.",
        "Shayne: Well, my next step is getting a bite to eat.",
        "Marina: Why don't you guys join us at company? Employee discount.",
        "Shayne: Hm?",
        "Sandy: I, i... Giddy-up, I'm in.",
        "Tammy: You guys go ahead. But call me if you hear about marah.",
        "Shayne: We will.",
        "Beth: Alan, do we really have to wait for gus?",
        "Alan: Beth, he will come.",
        "Beth: Oh, thank god. Well, what took you so long?",
        "Alan: Look, i'm sure he got here as soon as he could.",
        "Gus: Well, sure. As soon as you tell me what's going on.",
        "Alan: Look, this is a little awkward of me, but i need to ask a favor.",
        "Gus: No favors. No favors. This is family. First of all, does phillip even know that his kid's alive?",
        "Beth: Yes. He's the one who told lizzie.",
        "Gus: Oh. Okay. And how long has she been gone?",
        "Lillian: Not long. Olivia came over here right away after she found out.",
        "Gus: And where's olivia?",
        "Alan: Well, she's out looking for elizabeth now.",
        "Beth: Gus, you know lizzie's history. She doesn't get along with olivia and she is very protective of her father.",
        "Gus: So what are you saying? She swiped the baby to punish olivia?",
        "Beth: I honestly don't know, but I do know that we can't stand around talking anymore. We have to go look for her because lizzie doesn't know how to take care of a baby.",
        "Lillian: She's absolutely right.",
        "Gus: Yeah, well, we're going to get on that. First, i just want everybody to realize what we're dealing with here. Okay, we have a young girl who's got a history of mental instability-- no offense to you, you know-- and now she swipes the baby. I just want everybody to realize what we're getting into, okay? Just tell me what places could she be? What places does she have access to, that the family owns?",
        "Alan: Wait, wait. I don't know why i didn't think of this. Phillip's loft.",
        "Lillian: Absolutely.",
        "Alan: Yeah, it'S...",
        "Lillian: It would be a perfect hiding place. She'd be connected to her father there.",
        "Alan: It's vacant. It's safe.",
        "Gus: Okay, fine. We're going to go there. Would you guys just stay here in case somebody calls on the phone? Just man the phones? Let's go find your granddaughters.",
        "Lillian: Hurry.",
        "Lizzie: Come on, tammy. Is your phone ever on? Hey, it's me. Listen, give me a call as soon as you get this, all right? I've sort of got a situation. Just call me, okay?",
        "Cassie: I do not know why i pay for this if she never has it on her. But I can turn it off and save the battery.",
        "Olivia: Where's tammy?",
        "Cassie: She's upstairs. Why? What's wrong?",
        "Olivia: My baby is gone, cassie. My baby is gone and that monster took her.",
        "Cassie: What are you talking about?",
        "Olivia: Lizzie took my baby. And it's your fault!",
        "Cassie: Lizzie has emma?",
        "Olivia: I told you she was dangerous. I told you. Didn't i tell you that? But you wouldn't listen to me, right? You gave me an ultimatum. And phillip, he wasn't ready, cassie. He's the one who told lizzie about the baby.",
        "Cassie: Oh, my god.",
        "Olivia: So you got what you wanted, okay? You got your clear conscience and now my baby has to pay. Because I don't know where she is or what lizzie is doing to her.",
        "Cassie: I'm so sorry.",
        "Olivia: Don't say you're sorry. I'm sorry. Your babies are safe. I don't I know where mine is.",
        "Tammy: Mom?",
        "Cassie: Tammy, can you go upstairs for a minute, please?",
        "Olivia: No. You're lizzie's friend. You tell me. You tell me where she is.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, go home, you stupid nurse. I want to talk to my dad. (Sighs) okay. You know, I know what we're going to do. All right? (Sighs) all righty. Come on. It's okay. Get your little toy. (Sighs) let's go.",
        "Sandy: If these... You know, if these burgers are cold, you're in deep trouble, lady.",
        "Marina: I drove as fast as i could.",
        "Shayne: Yes, she did. You know, it would have been easier if we'd just stayed at company.",
        "Marina: I just couldn't. I would have started bussing the tables and filling the ketchup bottles.",
        "Sandy: Speaking of ketchup, there's no ketchup. Who forgot the ketchup?",
        "Shayne: That's okay, brother, I can fix that. I'll be right back.",
        "Sandy: All right.",
        "Marina: Look at how happy marah was in this picture. It wasn't even that long ago and now...",
        "Sandy: And now we're all doing everything we can to be cheerful because being depressed isn't going to help marah. Right?",
        "Marina: Right.",
        "Sandy: And she's going to make it through this mess and everything's going to be fine. Right?",
        "Marina: Right. It's just that she's had a pretty miserable year.",
        "Sandy: I'm well aware of that. I contributed to it. So nobody wants to see her happier more than I do. So, we must send out good energy, right now. Good energy.",
        "Marina: Oh, no. You're not going to start chanting are you?",
        "Sandy: No. I think it's really honorable that you're so worried about marah, but there's something else you might want to worry about.",
        "Marina: What? The ketchup?",
        "Sandy: No. You.",
        "Harley: See, this is why we make a great team. You have the psychic abilities, I have the high-tech gadgets.",
        "Reva: You had that running the whole time?",
        "Harley: Yeah. Remember when I went into my bag before i left to get my car keys? I turned it on. You didn't think i'd leave you without backup, did you?",
        "Rick: You and your bag of tricks.",
        "Reva: So the whole confession, her whole confession is on there?",
        "Carrie: A young woman died. Someone... Someone had to be punished.",
        "Reva: So you orchestrated your own death, lured all the players to the fun house?",
        "Carrie: (Laughs) brava, reva. Brava. I always knew I had to be very careful of you, of your strange gifts.",
        "Reva: That's it! We got her! (Laughter)",
        "harley: Wait, wait. First we still have to prove the tape is real, we have to prove it was recorded tonight. It may not be admissible in court. Anything our medical examiner wants to add?",
        "Rick: Well, i mean, obviously we have fresh blood all over this chair. I mean, if it's carrie's blood, then we have ourselves a timeline.",
        "Reva: Physical evidence, a taped confession. I say we get to the courthouse.",
        "Rick: We make a good team.",
        "Harley: Yes, we do.",
        "Rick: I tell you. Good work.",
        "Josh: You shouldn't have come down here, sweetheart.",
        "Marah: I couldn't just sit at home and wait. What was that all about? What was all the yelling for?",
        "Ross: Uh, marah, why don't you have a seat?",
        "Marah: I'm fine.",
        "Ross: No, no, no. Come on, sit down.",
        "Marah: Will you tell me what happened? Somebody, please?",
        "Jeffrey: Marah, the grand jury handed down an indictment.",
        "Josh: You're going to have to stand trial for murder.",
        "Ross: Marah, I want you to remember that it is very easy for a prosecutor to secure an indictment, but that's a far cry from going to trial and winning a case. Now, we are going to have our day in court.",
        "Marah: It's better this way. This is how it was supposed to be. I shot carrie. She's dead because i killed her.",
        "Josh: Marah, you had no choice. If you hadn't shot her, she would have killed me.",
        "Marah: I know. I know. But she's still dead because of me. No matter what happens in court, that isn't going to change. So, when does the trial start?",
        "Jeffrey: I don't think we need to go into all these details right now. Counselor, i think perhaps it would be better if ms. Lewis made her way home.",
        "Ross: Ah, yes. Yes, i agree. Marah, why don't we go out through chambers? Press is not allowed out back.",
        "Josh: I love you, sweetheart. It's going to be okay. You know, I wish she would yell or scream or cry or something. Anything would be better than this! I thought she was going to be... I thought everything was going to work out and she was going to be okay.",
        "Jeffrey: She will, josh. I'm going to make sure of it.",
        "reva: Oh, they're here. I'm so glad I found you. I've got news. It's about...",
        "Josh: Reva, the grand jury handed down an indictment. Marah is going to stand trial for murder.",
        "Reva: The hell she is. Carrie's alive.",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Reva: Carrie's alive.",
        "Jeffrey: What are you talking... How do you know?",
        "Reva: We saw her.",
        "Harley: We tracked her through a tunnel that runs underneath the fun house. It's how she got away the night of the shooting.",
        "Josh: Where is she now?",
        "Reva: Well, she hit me on the head and she got away, but, you know, we can find her.",
        "Jeffrey: She got away? So you don't know where she is. I mean, we need some proof, reva. All we have is your word.",
        "Harley: And hers.",
        "Reva: So you orchestrated your own death, lured all the players to the fun house.",
        "Carrie: (Laughs) brava, reva. Brava. I always knew I had to be very careful of you.",
        "Harley: Carrie has no idea yet but we have her entire confession on tape.",
        "Josh: So that's all we need, right?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, no, not quite. I mean, we have to verify the time frame.",
        "Reva: Well, done. Right?",
        "Harley: Yeah, we have carrie's fresh blood in the tunnel.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, we also need to verify her voice and we need another example.",
        "Josh: We have the other tape, the one from the mc corporation where she's giving instructions. She's leaving instructions, right?",
        "Reva: We did it. We did it.",
        "Josh: You did it. You just saved our daughter's life.",
        "Marina: Oh, no. Not another \"marina, you're not dealing with your own trauma\" lecture.",
        "Sandy: So, you're saying I'm not the first.",
        "Marina: Oh, i can only hope you're the last. I have been dodging my whole family lately because whenever i run into them, i always get them in this, like, really hushed tone of voice.",
        "Sandy: Sounds very soothing, marina.",
        "Marina: It's not. It's creepy. And they all do it. My grandpa, who's, like, overwhelmed with guilt. My aunt harley, gus. Oh, my dad, he's the topper. He and his girlfriend ambushed me the other night. I thought I was going over for this nice, you know, popcorn, movie night. It turned into a \"marina, how are you doing?\" Intervention.",
        "Sandy: Well, they're your family. They love you. That's nice.",
        "Marina: Of course it's nice. They're just too much. They make me feel kind of claustrophobic when I'm around them.",
        "Sandy: Well, you did have a rough year. Right? Maybe they wish they could have protected you from some of the bad stuff.",
        "Marina: Oh, i just want it to be over. I want to move on.",
        "Sandy: Good. That's healthy.",
        "Marina: You know, i wish that i could just skip everything that happened in the last year. Just start over.",
        "Sandy: Starting over. Yeah, I know a little bit about that. I started from scratch when i came to this town.",
        "Marina: Maybe i should move to a new town.",
        "Sandy: Okay, see, now that would be crazy, because you already have everything I came here looking for. You've got family, you've got friends, you've got all these people who care about you.",
        "Marina: Is that all you wanted?",
        "Sandy: Yeah! That's all i wanted. When you don't have it, it's a pretty big thing.",
        "Marina: Yeah, i guess it is. So, now that you have your friends, your family, are you happy?",
        "Sandy: I'm not unhappy.",
        "Marina: I just want to be happy again.",
        "Sandy: Oh, there he is with the ketchup. Where'd you find that, brother? Detroit?",
        "Shayne: It was in the back of the pantry and i hope you guys saved me some french fries. Look at you. You look a little more relaxed.",
        "Marina: Yeah.",
        "Shayne: I guess it's a good thing we came here, huh?",
        "Marina: I'm just trying to breathe.",
        "Sandy: You know, kids, after we eat, we should play cards.",
        "Shayne: Don't do it. He's a card shark.",
        "Marina: I'm not afraid of him. I'm a cooper. We play cards.",
        "Sandy: Is that why I whipped your father a couple of months ago?",
        "Marina: Yeah, well, he's the weak link in the family.",
        "Sandy: Oh, yeah?",
        "Marina: Yeah. So first we eat and then we play. And you can't let me win because i'm in crisis. I need a good challenge.",
        "Sandy: You're on, cooper.",
        "Marina: Yeah?",
        "Alan: If the girls are in there, let me do the talking.",
        "Gus: Open the door.",
        "Alan: Damn!",
        "Lizzie: It's okay, it's okay. (Baby fussing) um, hey, tammy, it's me. Okay, so i'm outside of your mom's hotel. Listen, hopefully I'll catch you either on the way in or the way out, i don't know, but if you're in the middle of something, please just stop and come down here, okay, because I really need your help. I've kind of got a problem here. Okay? Just call me back. Bye. Okay, we've got to get you out of sight, okay honey? All right, here we go. Okay. All righty. There we go. It's okay.",
        "Olivia: So, tammy, where did she go? Did she tell you she was going to do this?",
        "Cassie: Olivia's baby is alive. Lizzie found out and she took her.",
        "Tammy: What? Why...",
        "Olivia: Just tell me what you know!",
        "Tammy: I don't know any... Wait. Where was the baby living? Was it with sam?",
        "Cassie: How do you know that?",
        "Tammy: I didn't know. I just... She said she wanted to give you a gift.",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Olivia: What? What did you do? What did you do?",
        "Tammy: Remember that day i was looking through the files?",
        "Cassie: You said you were getting the bellhop's number, tammy.",
        "Tammy: I was getting olivia's contact number-- sam's number. I didn't know...",
        "Olivia: What were you thinking? God, how can you be so...",
        "Cassie: All right, olivia. Lay off. Okay? You're the one who kept emma a secret. Tammy didn't know she was hurting your baby. She didn't even know there was a baby. So why don't you stop blaming the rest of the world and let's figure out how to get your daughter back? Olivia? Olivia.",
        "Olivia: My little girl. (Sobbing) my little girl. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do.",
        "jeffrey: So, doris, i don't think it would be wise to pursue the indictment against marah lewis. I mean, this thing may never make it before the jury but i wouldn't want you to look like a fool, you know? Trying to prosecute someone for the death of someone who's still very much alive.",
        "Reva: So you orchestrated your own death... Now I know what you went through with carrie. She wanted revenge and she was going to get it any way she could.",
        "Josh: Yeah, but she's not going to. Thanks to you.",
        "Harley: Oh, boy. That was fast.",
        "Josh: Did she agree to drop the charges?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I did all the bluffing i could, but doris said exactly what i would have said if i were prosecuting this case. Time frames can't be verified and tapes, well, they can be doctored.",
        "Harley: Okay, okay, okay. But we have more than that.",
        "Jeffrey: I know what we have, harley. But it's not enough. This thing is not even admissible.",
        "Reva: So her whole confession is worthless?",
        "Jeffrey: No. No. But what we need is rock solid proof.",
        "Reva: Like what?",
        "Jeffrey: Like carrie herself. We've got to find her and we've got to bring her in.",
        "Marah: Thank you for taking me here, ross. I just wasn't ready to go home. I feel like I'm cooped up there all the time. It's almost like jail.",
        "Ross: We are a long, long way from that. Marah, i wish there was something that i could say to make this whole thing easier for you.",
        "Marah: This is how it was supposed to happen. It's how carrie wanted it.",
        "Beth: Voice mail, again. Why haven't they called? We could be out there looking.",
        "Lillian: Honey, i am sure gus and alan will call as soon as they find out anything. Sweetheart, there's no way you could have known.",
        "Beth: Couldn't I?",
        "Lillian: No.",
        "Beth: Yes. I should have listened when lizzie said that she was suspicious. And the first time she said that, she swore up and down that olivia was going to kidnap phillip, and alan and I sat there and we told her there was nothing to worry about. I even drove her out to ravenwood to prove to her that she was wrong.",
        "Lillian: That was the night that olivia married phillip.",
        "Beth: Yes.",
        "Lillian: Mm.",
        "Beth: She didn't kidnap him but lizzie sure wasn't that far off. Why, why, why didn't i listen to her when she said she was suspicious? But mom, even after everything that lizzie has done, I still can't believe that she would hurt a baby. She wouldn't, right?",
        "Gus: Well, there's no doubt that they were here. We probably just missed them.",
        "Alan: They couldn't have gotten far.",
        "Gus: I've got to canvas the neighborhood. I'm going to call the station. I've got to fill them in, all right?",
        "Alan: Oh, gus, listen. This is elizabeth's little sister. There's no way in the world she's going to hurt her, all right?",
        "Gus: If she's feeding her this stuff, she's not a very happy little girl right now.",
        "Alan: Yes, but can't you see? She's trying. So when you call this in, don't make it sound like she's some kind of kidnapper, all right?",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay. Tammy and I, we're going to help you get emma. You just tell us how we can help, okay? Tell us how we can help.",
        "Olivia: Help? It's because of your help that i'm here in the first place.",
        "Lizzie: Tammy's still not answering. Okay, well, honey, we don't have any other choice. You ready? Let's go.",
        "Olivia: I swear to you, cassie, if anything-- anything-- happens to my little girl, i'm going to hold you personally responsible. And I swear, i will make you pay. Next, on \"guiding light.\"",
        "Marah: You're lying. You're lying to protect me, to keep me from going to trial. Well, you know what? It's not going to work, all right?Id let's just everybody face it, because I am a killer.",
        "Lizzie: Promise you'll forget me, please. (Baby fussing)",
