        "Phillip informed Olivia about Alan's drastic change in behavior, saying that Alan definitely seems delusional. He also told Olivia that Alexandra wants him back at Spaulding again in case Alan's not able to do his duties. Olivia, obviously unenthused over their living situation at the loft, told Phillip that it may not be a bad idea, adding that the two of them could work side-by- side, but Phillip told her he wants no part of the Spaulding money or power, saying that it's destructive and ever-consuming. At \"Company\", Eden met with Ben, who was fretting over the expenses involved in living at the old museum. Eden pressed Ben, reminding him of the money to be made by \"entertaining\" women like Ramona. Ben left to go see Ramona at her suite at \"The Beacon\".....Buzz left Marina in charge of \"Company\" after he got a call from Frank about Harley's perilous situation. Eden, who was worried about Gus, insisted on tagging along with Buzz.....Rick dropped in and ordered coffees from Marina, who told him about Harley being held at gunpoint. Rick immediately left.....Later, Shayne showed up at \"Company\" to give Marina a hand with customers.....Marina wasn't pleased when Ben came back and told her he had to go off to \"work\".",
        "Frank, Gus and a SWAT team set-up a command post at the museum, which was across the street from the building where Harley was being held. Gus tried negotiating with Steve Gidric (the perpetrator) over the phone, but his efforts failed. Gidric, who resented women, was livid at his girlfriend, Marie, for withholding the fact that he had a son. Later, Harley calmly reasoned with Gidric, persuading him to give himself up. Gidric allowed Harley to call Gus to notify him that the three of them were going to leave the apartment. Gidric held Marie in front of him, to act as his shield, as they began leaving the apartment, but Marie broke loose and took off. Gidric fired a shot after her.....Across the street, after hearing the shot, Gus insisted on going in, but Frank ordered him to stay put. After Frank turned his back, Gus pulled out his gun and headed off.....Gus climbed the fire escape outside Marie's apartment. Frank radioed Gus and ordered him to hold his fire and let Harley do her job.......Inside, Gidric raged, telling Harley how all women were liars and was about to shoot her when Harley tried to grab the gun away from him. As the two struggled for the gun, Gus smashed-in the living room window with his elbow, aimed his gun, and shot. Harley reeled around and fell, Gidric falling on top of her......."

        "Frank: Listen, we need your place for a little while. It's really important.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Phone rings)",
        "Harley: You know what? If you're not going to answer it, maybe you can just unplug it so we don't have to listen to it ring.",
        "Steve: Just shut up. I'm trying to think.",
        "Marie: A little late for that now, don't you think?",
        "Steve: Oh, and you always with the mouth.",
        "Marie: Maybe I've got things to say.",
        "Steve: Oh, well, you didn't have squat to say to me about having a son! For nine years you kept that to yourself.",
        "Marie: Can you blame me?",
        "Steve: What did you say to me? Huh? I'm talking to you damn it!",
        "Marie: Go ahead. Get off on it.",
        "Harley: Marie, shut up! The man has a gun. Let's try to be polite to the man with the gun.",
        "Steve: Yeah, remember that.",
        "Harley: Look. Look, look, Mr. Getery, it's obvious that you are not going to talk to the police negotiator. That's fine. But I'm here. Why don't you talk to me?",
        "Steve: What is this, you being polite? No, this is you working me.",
        "Harley: This is me trying to stay alive. I know how the department works. I know how the officers think. So maybe I can help you figure out a way to get out of this thing, you know, so nobody gets hurt. Does that work for you? That was the most important thing right you would have no reason to trust me but you're the one with the gun, right?",
        "Steve: Get away from there.",
        "Harley: I heard something.",
        "Steve: We all heard it. Sit down and shut up. They have a swat team in the room.",
        "Harley: What did you expect? It's a hostage situation. It doesn't have to stay that way. You can still make a deal.",
        "Steve: What do you get out of it, what's in if for you?",
        "Harley: I have three kids that I would like to see again.",
        "Steve: That is so sweet. Why should you watch your kids grow up when I didn't see mine.",
        "Harley: Killing me isn't going to bring back the years that you missed with Darren.",
        "Steve: You're right. She ought to die.",
        "Harley: Wait. I know what it's like to lose time with your kid. I lost an eternity with my older child. I know how that feels.",
        "Steve: At least you knew you had a kid.",
        "Harley: That made it worse because I gave her up for adoption. I was always sitting there wondering, what is she doing? Where is she? I gave her up, because I was a kid myself. I was barely a teenager.",
        "Steve: Made a mistake, huh?",
        "Harley: Well, I don't know if bringing a beautiful little baby in the world is a mistake. I was too young to be a mother.",
        "Steve: So bye-bye baby.",
        "Harley: There is a miracle in the whole thing, Steam. ... Steve. She came back to me. Found her way back to me, maybe five years older than your boy is now.",
        "Steve: That is a sweet little story.",
        "Harley: The reason I'm telling you this is because I will never get back the time that I have lost with her. The time I have had with her since has been such a blessing. You can have that, too. You can have that with Darren, time, together. But, Steve, first thing, you have to get out of here alive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Hey Gus, surveillance camera speeds up.",
        "Gus: It's all fuzzy. Come on, Tommy can you sharpen the images? Who's focusing this thing. Who are they? There. Looks like Coop's trying to talk him down. What's he carrying?",
        "Frank: I can't tell.",
        "Gus: At least he's listening to her. It should be me in there Frank.",
        "Frank: Come on, Gus. Who's the guy?",
        "Gus: His name is Steve Getery. Armed robbery and assault with a warrant out for his arrest.",
        "Frank: His girlfriend looks scared to death.",
        "Gus: Why he would get his old lady mixed into this.",
        "Frank: Pick up the phone and maybe we can get answers. You don't smoke anymore, remember.",
        "Gus: I don't. It's a shape. I hope he smokes.",
        "Frank: So you can bum some cigarettes off of him?",
        "Gus: Maybe if he smokes he'll ask for cigarettes even.",
        "Frank: Or food. All we can do is sit tight and wait. That's it.",
        "Gus: My God. That is your sister there, Frank.",
        "Frank: I'm aware of that.",
        "Gus: Do you want to sit like tight while this guy goes crazy. We have a swat team. Let them do their job.",
        "Frank: They are but I'm giving my sister a chance to do her job. So you just sit tight and wait. Keep an eye out here, do you understand with me? I'm going to check in with my family and let them know the situation.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: You know, your thumb could actually end up in the next crumb cake if you're not careful.",
        "Marina: Sometimes I really hate working here, like now, for example, what is that?",
        "Buzz: I'll tell you what, five more minutes of brutal child labor and you can either drop on Ben and the angel of darkness to your heart's content.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ben: Do you know how much I can miss in five minutes?",
        "Eden: You keep looking at that paper. What is it, the obituary to your trust fund?",
        "Ben: You're funny. No that it's any of your business it's my share of the moving expenses. I can't believe it's this high. I haven't even moved in yet. I slept in the carriage house last night. Amazing what life can hit you with sometimes.",
        "Eden: Ramona can change that and make your life comfortable and never want for more and she called again and wants to see you today.",
        "Ben: Is everything so spur of the moment with her",
        "Eden: What? She can't hear us. Look, if you don't want to spend a very profitable afternoon with a very rich and beautiful woman that thinks you're a total hottie, that's fine. That's your choice, and your loss. Ramona Hendon can spend thousands on you. But she won't wait forever.",
        "Ben: I just don't think I can go through with this.",
        "Eden: With what? Sex with Ramona?",
        "Ben: Shhh.",
        "Eden: What is it with you? Are you a virgin? Are you saving it for Marina?",
        "Ben: None of the above.",
        "Eden: Oh, well, what? Don't tell me it's your pride. You can't afford pride anymore, Ben.",
        "Ben: I care about Marina, all right? (Phone rings) And I do not want to hurt her.",
        "Eden: The don't tell her.",
        "Buzz: Company. Hey, Frank. There's only one guy? They can make contact? All right. Jude is with the Bauer's, and Zach I think is with Phillip. I don't know. Should I call them now or wait till we hear more?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: Hey, buddy, don't do that. Come here. Come on play with me. Play with Daddy.",
        "Olivia: Does Zach always wake up at first light?",
        "Phillip: Most of the time, yeah. Not your favorite time of day.",
        "Olivia: Not lately. Crackers help.",
        "Phillip: Yeah, I seem to remember the morning sickness eases off around week 16, something like that.",
        "Olivia: Oh, please come on, week 16.",
        "Phillip: That's also... I mean I got some shades in here. Block some of this light. That'll be better.",
        "Olivia: Like the one's at the mansion?",
        "Phillip: Yeah.",
        "Olivia: It seemed like a thousand years that I didn't see the sunlight. That was another lifetime.",
        "Phillip: Yeah, well, everything changes. Sometimes very, very fast.",
        "Olivia: Are you all right?",
        "Phillip: Yeah, I'm... I don't know. I just... I don't know. You know, yesterday... yesterday I felt so positive without all this and about leaving the family and about being here. And yesterday I felt like a whole new world was opening up.",
        "Olivia: Well, you certainly opened up to Harley about my pregnancy.",
        "Phillip: Was I out of line?",
        "Olivia: I was so surprised that you blurted it out like that.",
        "Phillip: Sorry.",
        "Olivia: You know what? Never mind. It was exuberance. You've obviously come back down to earth.",
        "Phillip: Well, being around my family will definitely do that.",
        "Olivia: What exactly is wrong with Alan?",
        "Phillip: Where should I start? He just seems a little off, you know? He's belligerent and confused and... Whatever is wrong with him, it came on incredibly fast. And of course, in true Spaulding fashion, Alexandra's trying to use to her advantage.",
        "Olivia: Did she say something to you?",
        "Phillip: No, not really, because she didn't have time. But she sort of pointedly talked her way around the subject.",
        "Olivia: You got the message though?",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah, she wants me back. Back in the family, back in the company. All of it. She just never quits.",
        "Olivia: Well, would you go back? Because it wouldn't be the worse thing in the world. Did you get Zach down for his nap?",
        "Phillip: Yes.",
        "Olivia: Wow. Hey, does every little boy have the innate ability to use a paper towel core as a tunnel for his toy truck?",
        "Phillip: Everyone that I've ever known.",
        "Olivia: You know, I wasn't suggesting that you should go back to Spaulding.",
        "Phillip: Just that if I did it would be fine with you.",
        "Olivia: Yeah. Why do you think I'm here? I love you. I want to share your life with you.",
        "Phillip: No matter where and how I choose to do it?",
        "Olivia: Why are you giving me a hard time about this?",
        "Phillip: Maybe it's got something to do with how fast you jumped on the idea of me going back to Spaulding.",
        "Olivia: Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's how you took it. I was just trying to be supportive. I'm sorry if the gimmick crosses the goading of a greedy witch.",
        "Phillip: All right. I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm a little thin-skinned about my family right now.",
        "Olivia: Agreed. So what did Alexandra say that tipped you off that she had hopes for you?",
        "Phillip: She said that after I moved out, Alan asked to see Brandon's will. And she made a couple of cracks about my future. Nothing specific, just... I got the feeling. Why?",
        "Olivia: I just think you should draw her out a little bit, see what's on her mind. Knowledge is power, whether you choose to act on it or not.",
        "Phillip: Don't you understand? See, no, this is exactly why I left.",
        "Olivia: I do understand. But it couldn't hurt to...",
        "Phillip: Yes, it can. It can. That's the point, it can. Because this is probably just a trap. It's probably just a trap that's she's setting using Alan as bait.",
        "Olivia: You're worried about him.",
        "Phillip: If he as sick as he seems to be, it's not good news.",
        "Olivia: Okay. You said that everything changes. What if Alan's problem forces him to step down from Spaulding? Alexandra's going to need you more than ever. And say you did decide to go back. You wouldn't have to run Spaulding alone. We could do it together.",
        "Phillip: You're being supportive again? Or is that what you want?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eden: Ben, you can say no if this doesn't feel right, but I'm not going to ask again. Look, I have a business to run, and I have clients to take care of. That is my priority. Not trying to convince you that this is one hell of a way to make a ton of money. Have fun with your little kitchen maid.",
        "Ben: Is she at the Beacon?",
        "Eden: Room 604. Just call first.",
        "Ben: Do me a favor, all right? Just tell Marina I had to go to work.",
        "Eden: Well, that is the truth, isn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Well, do they know who the guy is?",
        "Buzz: A career criminal wanted for armed robbery.",
        "Marina: How... how did this happen? I mean, I don't understand. Stuff doesn't happen to her?",
        "Buzz: I don't know, I don't know. I only know what Frank told me.",
        "Marina: This is just so weird. You know what I mean? She was just right there yesterday.",
        "Buzz: I'll tell you what. You want to be treated like an adult? Take care of this place until I get back from talking to Frank.",
        "Marina: Okay.",
        "Buzz: The keys.",
        "Marina: Keys. Go.",
        "Eden: Thank you. You know you're really good at this.",
        "Marina: Uh-huh. Where's Ben?",
        "Eden: I don't know. He said something about work. Sorry, you had such bad news.",
        "Marina: Bad news is that my Aunt Harley is being held hostage, and I need his help here.",
        "Eden: Harley's in trouble. Buzz. Buzz, what happened? Buzz, what happened?",
        "Buzz: My daughter's being held at gunpoint.",
        "Eden: Well, where is Gus?",
        "Buzz: I don't know.",
        "Eden: Well, he's her partner.",
        "Buzz: Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steve: Now who's kidding who? I'm not getting out of this place alive.",
        "Harley: That's not true. You know why? Because killing you isn't worth the hassle.",
        "Steve: That's a good one.",
        "Harley: No, I'm dead serious. I'm dead serious. An officer discharges their weapon when they kill someone, first thing they have to deal with, all that paperwork. And then the reporters, and then the grand juries, and the lawyers. It is just a nightmare.",
        "Steve: You are... you are so full of it.",
        "Harley: I'm not. And you know what? You haven't even used that weapon yet. There's still a chance for you, Steve. (Phone rings)",
        "Maria: Steve, talk to them please.",
        "Harley: You should give it a try. I mean, hey, if you're a dead man like you say you are, what do you have to lose?",
        "Gus: Pick up the... yes.",
        "Steve: Who's this?",
        "Gus: Hi, this is Gus Aitoro, Springfield Police Department. How are you doing there, Steve?",
        "Steve: Oh, just great. We're having a party over here.",
        "Gus: You're kidding me. And you didn't invite me. That's a shame.",
        "Steve: Well, no worries. It's not going to be going on for too much longer.",
        "Gus: Well, do you guys need anything over there, like food or something? There is three of you, right?",
        "Steve: Like you don't know.",
        "Gus: I'm just being polite there, Steve.",
        "Steve: (Laughs) You're starting to sound like my lady cop here. She's got this thing about being polite, too.",
        "Gus: Well, I'm just asking. If you're hungry or thirsty or if you want any cigarettes or something, now is the time.",
        "Steve: How about a helicopter on the roof in 20 minutes?",
        "Gus: Well, now, see, Steve, when you start asking for fancy things like helicopters and stuff, things get a little complicated. You know, people get hurt, and that's my partner you got in there. I'd like to see her get out in one piece, if you know what I mean. So I'm sorry, I'm going to have to nix the chopper. I'm sorry about that.",
        "Steve: Well, then how about a hot air balloon?",
        "Gus: Yeah. That's good. I don't know. Let me ask the Chief. But on a more reasonable note, if you ask for something that I could get you, you know, I could try to... I could try to put something together for you. Please keep talking. Please. Please.",
        "Steve: Are you still there?",
        "Gus: Yes. Yes, I am.",
        "Steve: So how come you got a woman for a partner? Couldn't find a guy to work with you?",
        "Gus: Well, it's funny you should ask that. You know, Steve, when they first put us together I said to myself, \"There is no where in hell this is going to work.\" But you know something? I was wrong.",
        "Steve: You got a thing for her?",
        "Gus: Well, she's a first rate cop. She's got more going for her than half the guys on the force.",
        "Steve: Yeah, like what?",
        "Gus: Patience for starters. She's lasted longer with me as a partner than anybody in history.",
        "Steve: You trust her with your back?",
        "Gus: Yeah, I do actually. What you've got against women, Steve?",
        "Steve: They're liars.",
        "Gus: Well, my friend, I can't really argue with that.",
        "Steve: Oh, now, I thought your partner was such a prize.",
        "Gus: Well, no, she is. She's very special. But I'm talking about a whole bunch of other women that have fed me a lot of garbage. You know what I can't stand about their lies?",
        "Steve: What?",
        "Gus: I can't stand the way they twist them. You know, Steve, they twist them to make it seem like it's for you. It's for your own good or someone's good.",
        "Steve: Yeah, I hear you. You know my so-called girlfriend? She never told me that I had a son with her. For nine years, she kept that a secret. Said it was for his own good. Now how's that for a lie?",
        "Gus: Wow. Yeah, I can relate, Steve. You know, my mother, she only told me who my father is this week.",
        "Steve: What, are you serious?",
        "Gus: Believe me, pal, I wish that was the lie.",
        "Steve: Yeah, so what are you going to do about it?",
        "Gus: Honestly, I don't know, Steve. Because I got this little problem, you see, I got to clean up. There's this guy holding a couple of women against their will.",
        "Steve: Well, I'm sorry I'm taking up your time.",
        "Gus: Well, I'll tell you what, Steve. Why don't we just clean this thing up, you know? You play nice with me, I'll play nice with you. If you play nice, Steve, we could get rid of this whole idea of hostage and I can call the DA and maybe get the charges busted down to menacing. What do you say?",
        "Steve: What's that going to do for me?",
        "Gus: I don't know. That would be maybe one extra year tacked on to your armed robbery sentence. What do you say?",
        "Steve: No way.",
        "Gus: Listen to me, Steve. This is a guaranteed out, okay. I would take it. You're not going to get a better offer than this.",
        "Steve: I am not going back to Vailsburg.",
        "Gus: All right, well, then, Steve, what is the alternative? What would you like me to do, huh? Suicide by cop? Is that the way you want to go out?",
        "Steve: Well, it's better than going to the joint.",
        "Gus: All right, look. Okay, so we will go in there and we'll fill you with a bunch of holes, okay? That's going to be a hell of a first impression on your kid.",
        "Steve: Don't you dare lay that on me. This is all your fault!",
        "Gus: Steve! I lost him. Oh.",
        "Frank: That's okay. We'll get him next time.",
        "Gus: No. If there is a next time, Frank. Pushed him too hard.",
        "Buzz: Frank, any progress?",
        "Frank: Maybe. I'm not sure.",
        "Eden: Nicky, thank God, you're okay.",
        "Gus: Oh, God. All right. I'm not okay, okay? Harley's in there. I got to get her out.",
        "Eden: Promise me you won't do anything stupid.",
        "Gus: No, no promises.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: Pregnancy certainly hasn't affected your ambition any.",
        "Olivia: You're the one who seems hormonal.",
        "Phillip: Okay. Let's look at our options. Go ahead.",
        "Olivia: Alan's not himself, agreed?",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm.",
        "Olivia: There is the possibility that he might have to step down. If he's not there to interfere with you, why would you object to taking his place?",
        "Phillip: Because it's not just about Alan. Don't you understand? It's about the business. It eats into your time. It eats into your day and your life, day after day after day.",
        "Olivia: Any challenge is demanding.",
        "Phillip: Okay. Where's the line between demanding and destructive? See, that's what happens. There's so many meetings, there's so many out of town trips. Eventually you miss an anniversary or you miss one of your kids' birthday. First time it happens, you say \"That's okay, just this one time.\" But it'll happen again, and it will happen again, because you have to keep the company rolling. And then before long, you end up being a stranger in your own home with a wrecked marriage and a lifetime of missed opportunities behind you. That is what happens.",
        "Olivia: Whoa! You certainly had us all pegged, don't you?",
        "Phillip: I don't want to risk being right.",
        "Olivia: You wouldn't be if I were in on those meetings and if I took those trips with you.",
        "Phillip: You're about to have a child.",
        "Olivia: So?",
        "Phillip: So unless you're planning on getting some incredible nanny and kissing your kid good-bye a lot, I don't really see how the corporate power couple idea works.",
        "Olivia: We make it work.",
        "Phillip: How do we do that? You... I mean, you want to be a parent? You want to know your child, right?",
        "Olivia: All right, look. I'm more than willing to open myself up to your life. I want to, you know, to play trucks with Zach and get along with Harley, but you have to share my life, too. And I am ambitious, and there's nothing wrong with that. And I have dreams and goals.",
        "Phillip: I know that you do, but isn't one of them to have a safe place to share with somebody that you love? Hasn't that always been one of your goals?",
        "Olivia: You know it has. But we can have both.",
