        "Alan blamed Alexandra for all the losses he's suffered ever since she came back to town: his company, his house, Olivia & Phillip. He then told her he suspects she's plotting something else, but Alex called him paranoid. Alan requested another cup of tea, and when Alex headed out to prepare it, Alan ducked out of the mansion.......Olivia was all frustrated at the loft, trying to clean and think of a fancy meal to prepare for she & Phillip, but at wit's end, she finally called a service to employ to do the work......Alan dropped in, bringing her a string of pearls she'd left at the mansion. Totally oblivious to Olivia's distant attitude, Alan began kissing her hand passionately. Alan seemed to be in a time-warp, believing he & Olivia were still happily married. Olivia, stunned and also concerned, took Alan back to the mansion, where Alexandra was. After Alan left the room, Olivia expressed concern to Alex over Alan's delusional state, and when she found out Alan hadn't seen a doctor yet, she told Alex to make an appointment---or she WOULD. Alex then called Mel. She panicked when Mel advised that Alan should have blood tests.....Later, a nurse came by to take blood tests---but Alex arranged for Lloyd to give blood instead of Alan!",
        "After pulling Steve Gidric off of Harley, Gus realized Harley had been shot and severely wounded. Frank and paramedics rushed in. Buzz and Rick, who were at the command post, also rushed in and Rick tended to Harley before she was transfered to Cedars.....As Marah & Eden bonded, Gus called Eden and told her Harley had been shot. Marina was shaken by the news and Shayne tried to comfort her.....Ben arrived at Ramona's suite at the \"Beacon\". She had wine all ready and was in a seductive mood. Before too long, she and Ben had sex. Afterwards, she told Ben she'd like it to be a weekly occurrence. Ben seemed to go along with it.....Later, Ben returned to \"Company\" and didn't like it when he saw Marina & Shayne sharing a close moment. Marina told him about Harley's shooting......Eden & Marah arrived at Cedars, and as Eden fussed worriedly over Gus, Marah received a call from Reva, who was in Vienna. Before Marah had a chance to tell Reva the news, Reva told her she \"feels\" that Harley's in some type of danger.....Frank raged at Gus, blaming him for Harley's plight. Gus was distraught as Mel and Rick worked over Harley. Rick notified Harley's concerned friends & family that they were finally able to stop Harley's bleeding and that surgery would have to wait until Harley was in the clear......While on the phone with Marah, Reva expressed a sudden, intense fear for Harley just as Harley went into cardiac arrest. The crash cart was hurriedly brought into the treatment room where Harley was, and defribillator paddles were used to try to get Harley's heart beating again, but the flat- line on the monitor persisted......As bright light enveloped Harley, she \"woke up\", hearing a woman's voice calling her. Sitting up, she stared straight ahead, and Nadine materialized. With a loving smile on her face, she approached Harley."

        "Alan: You know ever since you stepped foot in this city, my life has begun to unravel. First, it was the company and then the house, my wife, my son. Tell me what else are you planning on taking from me?",
        "Alexandra: Come on, darling, you're sounding downright paranoid.",
        "Alan: I know what this is about, Alexandra. It's like the game we played when we were children. The last one who's standing wins.",

        "Alexandra: I'll promise you one day you'll understand.",
        "Alan: Don't count on it. I'll tell you what I would like. I would now like some tea. Would you be so kind as to make me some of that tea?",

        "Peggy: ...Out of cardboard, toilet paper cores. All you need is scissors, glue, material, any old shirt or blouse will do. Then we're going to make an edible centerpiece to go with it. A sumptuous, tantalizing array of cucumbers, fruit and parsley nestled in a melon love boat. Or life raft depending on what type of cook you are.",
        "Olivia: Damn good cook, thank you.",
        "Peggy: Naturally, we'll want to decorate our napkin holders. I use beans, glitter, pine needles. Whatever I have around. The object is to make your table look luscious, seductive so that man of yours would want to drop his anchor and stay a while. Ready to begin? First we cut the material to fit around the toilet paper cores.",

        "Eden: Not enough to sacrifice my brother. I don't like anyone that much.",
        "Marah: I know what you mean. Shayne can be annoying sometimes, but I couldn't really imagine not having him around. You know, every time my mom was gone, my dad was always at work. So basically Shayne and I were together most of the time. It wasn't my choice, it was by default.",
        "Eden: You're different than I thought you'd be.",

        "Gus: It's all right. It's all right. Look, Frank, you do whatever you want to do, okay? Because I don't care. I only care about your sister. And if something happens to her, God forbid, she doesn't make it, you can take my gun and shoot me in my head, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Hey, did my dad call?",
        "Shayne: No. Look, I know you're worried about Harley, but like my sister said the best thing you could do right now is just to stay here and take care of things.",
        "Marina: Yeah, except I keep breaking dishes.",
        "Shayne: Don't worry about the restaurant right now. I was hoping you could help me out. You know, practice my pitching, strengthen my arm up a little bit.",
        "Marina: You want me to play catch?",
        "Shayne: Unless you'd rather play with your dollies.",
        "Marina: Okay. Ha-ha. Very funny, Shayne. Just give me the ball.",
        "Shayne: All right, don't scare me now.",
        "Marina: I'll try not to.",
        "Shayne: Right here. What was that? What was that? You pitched like a girl.",
        "Marina: Okay. Okay, just give me the ball again. Give it to me.",
        "Shayne: Let me see your hands.",
        "Marina: Why?",
        "Shayne: Because the size of your hands determines how many fingers you put on the ball.",
        "Marina: Okay.",
        "Shayne: Okay. Your hands are nice. Really nice.",
        "Marina: Yeah, maybe for somebody who scrubs counters all day.",
        "Shayne: Come on, don't put yourself down like that. When somebody gives you a compliment, you're suppose to say thank you.",
        "Marina: Thank you. Now show me how to throw a curve ball.",
        "Shayne: All right. So, your second and middle finger go on this seam right here like this, okay?",
        "Marina: Like that?",
        "Shayne: Yeah. Now to get the spin, you're going to snap your wrist down like this. Like that. No, like this. All the time keeping pressure with your middle finger, okay? So when you release, it's like... like that, okay? Let's try it again. How did that feel? Okay, let's play ball.",
        "Marina: Okay.",
        "Shayne: Right back here. Come on. Ow! Ow! (Marina laughs) I'm going to get you. You! You tricked me. You know how to pitch.",
        "Marina: Yeah, like a boy.",
        "Shayne: No, better than a boy. A lot better than a boy.",
        "Marina: Shayne, I'm serious. Stop it.",

        "Ramona: Would you hand me my other stocking, Ben? It wasn't like taking castor oil, now was it?",
        "Ben: You were great. Amazing.",
        "Ramona: For an old lady?",
        "Ben: There's nothing old about you.",
        "Ramona: Well, thanks. But I think I'll have to double up on my Pilates sessions to keep up with you. (Both laugh) So next week, same time, same place?",
        "Ben: Today was... I don't know what it was. But as to making it a regular thing...",
        "Ramona: Afraid, I'll corrupt you?",
        "Ben: No. No. It's not... No.",
        "Ramona: Well, that's good because I had an incredible time today and I would love to make it a regular occurrence. But that's up to you. I don't want you to feel pressured. So I got to run, okay? The room is paid for till the morning, so feel free to stay as long as you like.",
        "Ben: Mrs. Hendon... Ramona.",
        "Ramona: Yes, Benjamin?",
        "Ben: I had a nice time.",
        "Ramona: Well, that's great to hear. And if you could think of this as a beginning, you know where to reach me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Yes, I want you to search every inch of Spaulding. I want you to check the rooftop patio. I want you to check... Yes, every office there. Yes. My brother's been missing for over an hour. I... Never mind. He's here.",
        "Alan: Alexandra. Isn't it wonderful? Olivia has come back home.",
        "Alexandra: Wonderful. Where did you find him?",
        "Olivia: He found me.",
        "Alexandra: Well, listen, darling, why don't you go up and make sure that the maids have changed all the linens...",
        "Alan: Will you come up there?",
        "Olivia: Give me just a minute, okay? Then I'm going to have to hurry back to work.",
        "Alan: Okay. But don't forget to bring the plans. San Cristobel. It's going to be an amazing project. Almost as amazing as you are. Five minutes. Don't be long.",
        "Olivia: I don't believe this. Phillip said he was under a lot of stress, but he's completely delusional.",
        "Alexandra: Alan needs rest. A lot of rest.",
        "Olivia: No, Alexandra, he needs a doctor. And if you don't call one, I will.",
        "Alexandra: Dr. Mel Boudreau, please. It's Alexandra Spaulding calling and this is an emergency. Yes, Dr. Boudreau.",
        "Mel: I'm going to have to get back to you. I'm in the middle of something.",
        "Alexandra: Yes, but this is important. Look my brother has become irrational. He doesn't know what day it is, what month it is. He doesn't even know where is, what he's doing.",
        "Mel: Look, discontinue all medication and bring him in. We'll have somebody run some blood work.",
        "Alexandra: Blood work? Is that absolutely necessary? I mean, you have some... You have plenty of blood work on him, don't you?",
        "Mel: We have to determine whether it's physical or chemical. Just get him in here.",
        "Alexandra: I'm afraid my brother's in no condition to leave the house.",
        "Mel: Well, we'll send a nurse as soon as we can. But I'm in the middle of an emergency.",
        "Alexandra: Well, no, don't worry. You know, I think I can get our doctor to get these blood samples and get them over to you right away. Oh, God, think fast, Alex. Alan, don't be a baby about this. It's all for your own good.",
        "Nurse: All finished.",
        "Alexandra: Now make certain that Dr. Boudreau gets these samples right away.",
        "Nurse: First the lab then Dr. Boudreau.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, good. Well, thank you for coming over and thank Dr. Kirby for his cooperation.",
        "Nurse: It was nice meeting you. You too, Mr. Spaulding.",
        "Alexandra: Sorry about that, Lloyd. It's all for a good cause. If anyone should suspect that Alan's condition is artificially created, we'd have a big problem on our hands, wouldn't we?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Yeah, I used to play in the sandlot all the time with the boys when I was a kid. And the coach actually told me that I needed to, like, go learn how to bake cookies or do ballet. Which was so ridiculous, because I was clearly like one of the best players on the team. I mean around the horn, long toss, double pump. I was born to play ball. I was just, you know, born in the wrong body.",
        "Shayne: If that's the wrong body, I don't know what to tell you.",
        "Marina: Oh, shut up. You know what I mean. I just had so many ideas about the way the game should be played.",
        "Shayne: Maybe you could teach me a thing or two.",
        "Marina: Yeah, maybe I could.",
        "Ben: Hey.",
        "Marina: Hey, Ben, where have you been? Look, Harley got shot. She's in the hospital.",
        "Ben: What? I knew I should have stayed here with you. Are you...",
        "Marina: It's fine. It's fine. I mean, Shayne was here.",
        "Ben: Right. Thanks.",
        "Shayne: Yeah. I guess I'd better go check on stuff in there. See how things are.",
        "Marina: Yeah.",
        "Ben: You okay?",
        "Marina: Yeah, so how did it go with Mrs. Hendon? Did she give you something challenging to do?",
        "Ben: Yeah, you could say that.",
        "Marina: Good. Where's my handkerchief? Ben, the one I gave you.",
        "Ben: Oh, man. I must have left at the ho... At the office.",

        "Frank: Mel?",

        "Rick: There's possible liver involvement. The good news is that we got the bleeding under control and she's stabilized for now.",
        "Frank: Okay, once she has the surgery she's going to be fine, right?",
        "Rick: That's what we're hoping for, Frank. But we're still worried about infection. There's a possibility that the bullet could move and cause further damage.",
        "Gus: But her chances, how are they? They're good.",
        "Rick: She's tough, Gus. I have all the faith in the world in her.",
        "Frank: You know, would you look at him. He doesn't have a scratch on him and my sister is laying in there. You know what? If he wasn't such a cowboy, he wouldn't be there right now.",
        "Buzz: He didn't mean for her to be hurt like this.",
        "Frank: That's why he's so dangerous. I know he didn't mean for that to happen that way. But you know what? That's what ends up happening.",
        "Buzz: Frank, Harley doesn't need this.",
        "Frank: What do you know what she needs? I should have done a better job protecting my own sister.",
        "Buzz: You know, you would have taken that bullet for her. Everybody knows that.",
        "Frank: He disobeyed a direct order. I swear, if anything happens to sis, losing his badge will be the least of his worries.",

        "Gus: Well, has that ever stopped you before?",
        "Eden: Look, it wasn't your fault. If the situation was reversed, Harley would have done the same thing to save you.",
        "Gus: Yeah, but I didn't save her, did I?",
        "Eden: She's going to be fine. You heard Dr. Bauer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marah: Mom? Good news. Rick just came out and he said that Harley chances look good. So it looks like she's going to be...",

        "Reva: Harley is in terrible trouble.",
