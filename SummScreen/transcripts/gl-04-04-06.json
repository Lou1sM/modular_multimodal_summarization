        "Coop wonders what he has done when he wakes up in bed with Lizzie. She convinces him that they are meant to be together and after he admits that he does miss her and that last night was nice. She goes to take a shower so that they can go announce to his family that they are back together and while she is in the shower Joey Lupo shows up at the door. He tells Coop that Lizzie invited him over last night and Coop realizes that Lizzie lied to him again. She tells him that it was worth it since it brought them back together, but he leaves her at the apartment. Alan-Michael tries to convince Dinah that Harley is not as good as a friend as she thinks and Dinah says that the old Dinah would have hurt Harley for what happened at the meeting but that she has changed. Dinah goes to Gus's welcome home party at Company where Harley meets her and tells her that they need to talk since Mallet told Harley that Dinah knows about the night that they had sex. The women decide that there is nothing to talk about. Blake asks Harley to keep an eye on Dinah since she decided that she is going to tell Ross when he visits this weekend that she is going to move to Washington with him. Marina sees that Alan-Michael has followed Dinah and tells him to leave. A-M tells her that if she doesn't take him back he may have to make decisions that he isn't proud of. Billy suggests to Reva that she get an attorney because of the divorce papers but Reva says that she is confused by Josh's recent behavior. Josh admits to Cassie that he misses Reva and wants her back. Cassie tells Josh that he needs to tell Reva that, but Reva only overhears the negative parts and tells Josh that she got a lawyer."

        "Lizzie: Oops! Sorry!",
        "Coop: Lizzie!",
        "Lizzie: I ordered breakfast. I hope you're hungry.",
        "Coop: Yeah. Is there coffee over there?",
        "Lizzie: Just the way you like it. Here you go.",
        "Coop: Thank you.",
        "Lizzie: How did you sleep?",
        "Coop: Um, I slept okay, fine, I guess.",
        "Lizzie: I slept great. ( Giggles )",
        "Coop: Good.",
        "Lizzie: Look, I know what you're thinking. You're wondering if last night was a good idea. It's only natural. I had the exact same thought. But then I realized that everything really happens for a reason. You stayed here last night because you wanted to, because I wanted you to. It was meant to be. I felt it. I know you felt it. Besides, I know you, Henry Cooper Bradshaw. And you're not the kind of guy who would be here if it wasn't right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I got here as fast as I could. You didn't sound so good on the phone.",
        "Josh: Yeah, that's because I wasn't feeling so good.",
        "Cassie: Something happened with you and Reva?",
        "Josh: Yes. I screwed up, big time.",
        "Cassie: ( Sighs )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Hey.",
        "Billy: Hey. Hey, I'm sorry about yesterday.",
        "Reva: Well, it's not your fault. I mean, Josh is the one who wants the divorce.",
        "Billy: He said that?",
        "Reva: Billy, the papers said it for him.",
        "Billy: Oh, yeah, I guess.",
        "Reva: You guess? Come on, it was right there in black and white. It's just hard to believe, though, you know, because yesterday was amazing. It was just like old times, and then, wham! The ax fell. If Joshua wanted to cut me loose, why didn't he just do it? Why did he lead me on like that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Let's get this party started! That's what we need, good music. Come on, honey.",
        "Harley: Hi.",
        "Gus: Come down to the deejay.",
        "Buzz: Don't worry. I'm saving the Greek for last.",
        "Gus: Best for last, best for last. I'm just saying, you know, what else do you got?",
        "Harley: Why? Is there something particular you're looking for?",
        "Gus: No. What, your dad... it's great what you chose. I'm just seeing what else you have.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, right, right.",
        "Gus: Look, Greek trance music. ( Laughter )",
        "Harley: Welcome home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: I thought you could use one of these.",
        "Marina: Thanks. Guessed right.",
        "Ava: Things will get better.",
        "Marina: Yeah, sure they will, until I meet the next jerk.",
        "Buzz: Hey, hey, no more jerks. Where's Coop?",
        "Ava: Beat's me.",
        "Blake: So listen, I mean, I just can fully appreciate what it's like being reunited with the man that you love. Oh, Ross and I have been apart for so long, I just... I miss him. I miss him so much.",
        "Harley: So the weekend thing's not working out?",
        "Blake: Oh, not at all, not at all. He's just working too much in order to get away. And it's impossible, with three kids, all overscheduled, doing different things.",
        "Gus: When's he coming in?",
        "Blake: 6:17.",
        "Gus: Uh-huh. ( Laughter )",
        "Blake: Yes! We're having a party-- no children-- cake, ice cream, gummy bears.",
        "Harley: So let me guess, this was Clarissa's idea?",
        "Blake: Oh, yeah.",
        "Harley: Well, have fun. ( Laughter ) I know how much you love gummy bears.",
        "Mallet: Hey, guys.",
        "Blake: Hi.",
        "Mallet: Can I borrow you for a minute?",
        "Harley: Sure. Excuse me.",
        "Mallet: There's something I didn't get a chance to tell you, something you should know before Dinah gets here.",
        "Harley: Oh, gosh, that sounds scary.",
        "Mallet: She knows.",
        "Harley: She knows what?",
        "Mallet: She knows.",
        "Harley: ( Groans )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: You wanted to talk to me?",
        "Dinah: What's up?",
        "Alan-Michael: Isn't it obvious? Neither one of us got what we deserved yesterday.",
        "Dinah: You could speak for yourself. Snap out of it, Alan-Michael. It is what it is.",
        "Alan-Michael: Come on, Dinah. You can't be happy about what went down. You were all set to be top dog. But now, thanks to Harley, you're back to playing second fiddle, permanently. Don't tell me you're not looking for a way to get even.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: Your wife's a rock. I mean it. I don't know how she held up. I don't know what I would do if anything ever happened to Ross.",
        "Gus: You would have to hold up, wouldn't you? You'd do it. You'd do it for the kids.",
        "Blake: I guess.",
        "Gus: She never stopped believing.",
        "Blake: That's what true love's all about.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Blake: Just don't do it again, okay? I think she's maxed out.",
        "Gus: Oh, I'm maxed out, too. I am maxed.",
        "Blake: Mm-hmm. Now, if you could just get Ross to stick around maybe.",
        "Gus: Don't you worry about that.",
        "Frank: Oh, there he is! All right! Hey, guys. Listen, sorry we're late, but Olivia had a conference call, so...",
        "Olivia: Yeah, no, but you had your... your four-ten... your ten-four...",
        "Gus: What's that? One more time.",
        "Frank: She is so cute. It's a three-ten.",
        "Gus: Look, it's police humor! Little police jokes. It's really...",
        "Frank: A holdup would be a seven-ten.",
        "Olivia: Oh, please!",
        "Gus: Look at these guys.",
        "Olivia: It's charming.",
        "Gus: You made a funny, Frank.",
        "Olivia: It's charming.",
        "Gus: You made a funny.",
        "Blake: Well, I have to say that it's... it's very charming to see you two so, well... buddy, buddy...",
        "Gus: Chummy. Chummy to chummy.",
        "Frank: Okay, enough of that.",
        "Gus: You look good, Frank.",
        "Frank: Thank you.",
        "Gus: Looks good.",
        "Blake: Take it from me. Frank is one of the most standup guys around. I mean, you know, except for Ross, of course.",
        "Olivia: I'm impressed so far. You want to know what he did for me the other day?",
        "Frank: Oh, no, no, no. Olivia, don't... no, no, no.",
        "Olivia: It's so sweet. He ordered me stuffed pizza. Which doesn't sound like a big deal but it's my favorite comfort food in the world, and he had the chef at Towers whip it up for me, and I just think it's the sweetest thing in the world.",
        "Gus: Good for you.",
        "Blake: Wow.",
        "Gus: A big teddy bear. ( Laughter )",
        "Frank: I do what I can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: How could you be so stupid?",
        "Mallet: Honesty is stupid?",
        "Harley: No, I just... I'm not prepared for this. Could you give me a little heads up?",
        "Mallet: Well, for what?",
        "Harley: The fallout. There will be fallout, Mallet.",
        "Mallet: Well, I didn't plan on telling Dinah. It just kind of happened.",
        "Harley: What do you mean, it happened?",
        "Mallet: I told her when she broke up with me.",
        "Harley: Dinah broke up with you? When?",
        "Mallet: The night I went looking for you. I kind of left her dinner party early.",
        "Harley: So your brilliant idea to win her back is to tell her that we slept together? How's that going?",
        "Mallet: I'm trying here. It's... it's painful.",
        "Harley: Yeah.",
        "Mallet: Look, if Dinah and I are going to work, there can't be any lies between us. I mean, come on, you of all people should understand that. I didn't tell you the truth years ago, right? Look what it cost me.",
        "Harley: Yeah, that's true. I'm just really worried about what the truth is going to cost me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: You need to stop listening to everything you hear. I'm not a psycho chick. Every time I don't get what I want, my claws don't automatically come out.",
        "Alan-Michael: There's nothing psycho about fighting for you deserve.",
        "Dinah: You know, I don't know why I'm even listening to you because you lied to me, you used me. You sent me chasing after Harley and Mallet to that stupid inn, and you wanted me gone and her gone, so don't deny it.",
        "Alan-Michael: I want a clean shot at C.E.O. It doesn't mean we can't be on the same team.",
        "Dinah: You're so touching.",
        "Alan-Michael: Can you honestly tell me that you're not mad as hell about that board meeting? You're not furious with Harley for letting you think that the job was yours to keep and then at the last second yanking it away?",
        "Dinah: Let me tell you something. Harley took that job back so she could crush you.",
        "Alan-Michael: You're a good friend to her, a really good friend, but is she your friend? Does she really have your best interests at heart?",
        "Dinah: Alan-Michael, I am not happy with her choice today. In fact, I'm not real happy with a lot of things lately, and in the past I probably would have taken my own bare hands and hurt her with a lethal weapon, but those days are over, thank you. The new and improved Dinah has a different philosophy. She doesn't stab her friends in the back at the first sign of trouble. So you can take your offer and shove it where the sun don't shine.",
        "Alan-Michael: Oh, you're making a big mistake, sweetheart.",
        "Dinah: No, see, you are making a big mistake, baby doll, because, see, this is a lot bigger than you think it is, and this isn't about Marina, and you're going to take one failed campaign and replace it for another, and you're going to use me for the cover, am I right?",
        "Alan-Michael: Right. You're on to me.",
        "Dinah: You know, Alan- Michael, it's different and it's hard to stay honest, especially in this town. I probably struggle with it every day. And I know that you want Spaulding, and you're not going to get it. And I also know that you want Marina, but she's looking a little upset lately. But I still think it's a good idea to want it all, because that's the only way you're going to get anything in life. Cheers.",

        "Lizzie: No, don't get dressed.",
        "Coop: No, Lizzie, we have to.",
        "Lizzie: No, we don't.",
        "Coop: No, come... what? No, stop. Come on, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: What? I mean, was I totally off base? Don't you want to be here?",
        "Coop: Look, I... I don't know. Look, that's not what I meant to say. What I meant was...",
        "Lizzie: No, it's okay. You don't have to explain.",
        "Coop: No. Would you listen to me for just two seconds, please? Lizzie, I'm confused, all right? It's not that I don't feel something for you, because I do. It's just that I don't know what to make of things yet.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, what are you saying?",
        "Coop: I'm saying that I...",
        "Lizzie: Are you saying that you need more time?",
        "Coop: Yes. Time. Time would be really good thing. Are you okay, Lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: Was it really so bad? Do you hate being with me?",
        "Coop: No. No, not at all. Last night was...",
        "Lizzie: Was what?",
        "Coop: Last night, it felt good to be back where we were, you know, where we used to be. But... but it's time... it can't...",
        "Lizzie: Look, I know... I know that I really messed things up, and I made you doubt what we had, but I never stopped loving you, and you have to believe that.",
        "Coop: I do. I do. Lizzie, I do believe that. It's just that there were so many lies.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, the lies. There were a lot of lies, and I was wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, but I learned my lesson this time, I swear. You just have to give me a chance to prove it, to show you. I want that more than anything. Don't you? Don't you?",
        "Coop: Yeah.",
        "Lizzie: ( Yells out ) I knew it! I love you so much, and you love me, too. You are still in love with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You realize your timing stinks.",
        "Josh: Hey, this was not me, okay, Cassie? I mean, I never intended for Reva to see those divorce papers.",
        "Cassie: Well, then why did you have them drawn up?",
        "Josh: It was a long time ago, okay? That's where I thought we were going at that moment. I was having a bad day, and I wanted to get some control over my life, and then it sort of passed.",
        "Cassie: Okay, so why not tell your lawyer to hold off?",
        "Josh: I did. At least I thought I did. I guess the guy got mixed up or something.",
        "Cassie: Well, unmix him. Get Reva here and fix it.",
        "Josh: I don't think it's going to be that easy.",
        "Cassie: Well, of course it's not going to be easy. It's Reva and she's angry.",
        "Josh: No, actually, I think she's hurt. You should have seen the look on her face.",
        "Cassie: Well, did you try to explain?",
        "Josh: She didn't want to listen to me.",
        "Cassie: Of course not, because she's got it in your head that you want to get rid of her, but you have a chance to decide now, Josh. Do you or don't you want a divorce?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I mean, why would he act like that if he wanted to divorce me?",
        "Billy: He's just trying to let you down easy.",
        "Reva: No, that doesn't sound like him.",
        "Billy: Well, you know, I really can't speak for him. I mean...",
        "Reva: I didn't let him speak for himself.",
        "Billy: You were upset, he was upset.",
        "Reva: I just don't get it, Billy.",
        "Billy: It's nothing.",
        "Reva: What does that mean?",
        "Billy: Well, I'm saying, I've watched you two do this latest version of the dance for the last couple months-- together and miserable, half together, half not, push and pull, I mean, it just hasn't worked out.",
        "Reva: So, what? We're just supposed to end it?",
        "Billy: Well, I mean, you had a good day yesterday, so...",
        "Reva: Hey, you know what? You're not exactly an impartial third party here. I know how you feel about me.",
        "Billy: Yeah, well, you knew that coming in, didn't you?",
        "Reva: Billy, you wouldn't...?",
        "Billy: What, do something for my own agenda? Is that what you think?",
        "Reva: I'm asking you.",
        "Billy: Okay, look. I love you, I love my brother, and I'll do right by both of you.",
        "Reva: You know, I shouldn't be laying all this off on you anyway. You've got problems of your own.",
        "Billy: Darling, I love that you're laying it off on me. I laid things off on you in the last few months. You've been there for me. We kind of have a good relationship that way, don't we?",
        "Reva: It just doesn't add up.",
        "Billy: Okay. Those papers are fact, so now you've got to kind of be thinking about what you're going to do next.",
        "Reva: What I'm going to do?",
        "Billy: Yeah, you've got to get a lawyer. Josh got a lawyer.",
        "Reva: A lawyer?",
        "Billy: Yeah, yeah. I think you need to get a lawyer and protect yourself. That's what you got to do.",
        "Reva: No! No, no, no, no, no. Papers or not, I am not going down without a fight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: If we get back into that bed right there, I am not going to want to get out all day long.",
        "Lizzie: I'm actually okay with that, yeah. ( Laughter )",
        "Coop: I know that you are, but I'm not... we can't. Lizzie, stop. Please, come on.",
        "Lizzie: Come on, come on. Your family, they have a party every other day.",
        "Coop: I know that, but this is Gus' party, and this one is important. Please. This is important, Lizzie. Whoo!",
        "Lizzie: Okay. You're right. You're right.",
        "Coop: You mean that?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I mean it. As long as Gus and Harley can share the spotlight for a minute. Then we can tell everybody that we're back together! ( Laughter ) Eat. I am taking a shower.",
        "Coop: ( Sighs ) ( knock on door ) Lizzie... there... forget it. Yeah, coming, one second. ( Knocking continues ) Hold... one second. Jeez.",
        "Joey: Sorry, man, I got the wrong room.",
        "Coop: Well, what room are you looking for?",
        "Joey: Lizzie Spalding's. Joey Lupo.",
        "Coop: Hey, you think you can just show up here, beg Lizzie to take you back, maybe even threaten her?",
        "Joey: Threaten her? Dude, I was invited here.",
        "Coop: Yeah, sure, her stalker. You were invited.",
        "Joey: Stalker? Lizzie called me last night, told me to come down to her room so she could help me with my music.",
        "Coop: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. She called you last night? You were invited here?",
        "Joey: Yeah, I was invited here. You want proof, big guy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: I do not want a divorce. Not now.",
        "Cassie: Not now?",
        "Josh: Well, I didn't want a divorce then either, but she wasn't giving me a whole lot of options.",
        "Cassie: Okay. So what now?",
        "Josh: Excuse me?",
        "Cassie: What are you going to do now?",
        "Josh: I'm going to tell her I made a mistake and that I'm sorry. Thank you very much. I appreciate that.",
        "Cassie: And?",
        "Josh: I'm sorry. Am I missing something here?",
        "Cassie: That you want her back.",
        "Josh: No, no. Cassie, just slow down, all right? Because we're not there yet.",
        "Cassie: Well, you're not at the place to get a divorce, so where does that leave you exactly?",
        "Josh: We're just testing the waters right now.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I would call that in limbo, which, trust me, is a lousy place to be.",
        "Josh: I am not ready for a full reconciliation, and I know Reva's not.",
        "Cassie: How do you know that? Have you asked her?",
        "Josh: No.",
        "Cassie: What the hell are you waiting for, Josh? Life is short.",
        "Josh: Okay, Cassie, look, under the circumstances I understand what you're trying to do here, I really do, and I appreciate it. Could you give us a minute, please? Thank you.",
        "Cassie: It's pretty obvious what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to push you in the direction of my sister-- which, by the way, is exactly the direction you want to go in, only you're being difficult, fighting it, just to be difficult.",
        "Josh: I'd like to think I'm more grown up than that.",
        "Cassie: Okay, try this on. You're just plain old scared of getting hurt again. That's it.",
        "Josh: Okay. I know that I've said in the past that I don't want to climb back on that roller coaster again, but...",
        "Cassie: But you love that roller coaster.",
        "Josh: Yeah, Billy thinks it's an addiction.",
        "Cassie: Well, you know, I can think of worse things for you to be addicted to. You have to tell her.",
        "Josh: It's too late for that, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Why?",
        "Josh: Because everything has changed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Maybe Josh had those papers drawn up because he thinks it's what I want.",
        "Billy: Well, well... maybe it's what he wants.",
        "Reva: Well, I have to ask.",
        "Billy: Are you sure you're going to like the answer?",
        "Reva: I may not.",
        "Billy: Are you ready to live with that?",
        "Reva: Are you asking me if I'm ready to stand in front of a firing squad?",
        "Billy: Well, I'm trying save you a little pain, that's all.",
        "Reva: And what is the divorce, a picnic in the park?",
        "Billy: I think you should just let it go.",
        "Reva: No. Josh and I reconnected, Billy. It's not just my imagination. I mean, maybe you're right, maybe... I don't know, maybe he was trying let me down easy, or maybe he's changing his mind. I know one thing for sure: Those papers have been in the works for months, Billy. I mean, you know how lawyers work. They charge by the hour. Nothing happens overnight. At least I have that going for me. Thanks.",
        "Billy: Reva. I really don't want to see you get hurt.",
        "Reva: I'd rather get hurt than do nothing.",

        "Josh: Welcome to the club. Because you know what? Reva drives me crazy every single day. Sometimes its a good crazy, sometimes it's a bad crazy. But it's always crazy. Do you have any idea how many times things have fallen apart for us in the years that we've known each other? But this time, Cassie, this Reva crisis that's happening now, this is different. It came out of absolutely nowhere. It hit me right between the eyes. The next thing I knew, my marriage was on the rocks. Was it Jonathan, was it Nate, was it menopause, was it all of the above, was it none of the above. Your guess is as good as mine.",
        "Cassie: Can she be reckless sometimes? No question.",
        "Josh: It's not about... it's not about her being reckless. She broke my heart, okay? Now I freely admit that's not a new thing in our life. But, Cassie, I mean, this time around I couldn't figure out how to fix it. And then it finally hit me that I couldn't fix it because it was in Reva's head. I have this theory about marriage, okay, that each person has to be willing to accept at least half of the responsibility in any given situation whether they're right or wrong, but in this case, in this case it was all Reva. It was 100% Reva. And at first I was just confused about it. And then I was angry and then I was hurt. Then there was a time when I felt like I never wanted to see her again.",
        "Cassie: And now?",
        "Josh: And now that feeling has passed. Because time is a powerful thing, you know. It makes miracles happen. And it makes people change their minds. It allows for that. Something happened when she was giving her speech at her old high school. She said something about destiny, being able to find our place in life, and she said if you... if you listened hard enough, you'll know. And I feel now like I'm listening again. I miss her. I miss her more and more every day.",
        "Cassie: You have to tell her.",
