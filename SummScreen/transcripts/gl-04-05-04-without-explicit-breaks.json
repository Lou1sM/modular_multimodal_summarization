        "Reva corrals Christopher and tells him they must put aside the recent strain on their relationship to help Marah. Reva feels if she can find out why Maryanne Caruthers is reaching out to her, she can clear Marah's name. Christopher is concerned but agrees, partly out of guilt for having lied to Reva for so long. He hypnotizes her and she finds herself not only making contact with young Maryanne \u0096 but also experiencing, side by side with her, the fateful night she went over the bridge. Reva sees Maryanne's encounter with young Josh, the other young men and, surprisingly, a young Carrie. In a heated discussion, Carrie tries to exert control over Maryanne and make her come home, but Maryanne takes an independent stance and goes off with the men. Reva then witnesses the real murder of Maryanne Caruthers as Carrie finds Maryanne on the riverbank after the car went over the bridge. Carrie and Maryanne continue the argument from before but a weakened Maryanne is no match for Carrie who suffocates her with a shawl around her neck. Reva, who is experiencing all that Maryanne is, begins also to suffocate as Christopher races to break the hypnosis and save her life. Josh tracks down Harley for help in locating Carrie but Harley has little to offer. Tony arrives with an alternative: he knows some people who might be able to help. Josh finds himself tempted, if only for a moment, before rejecting Tony's help, saying that he won't compound the mistake he made 30 years ago by commissioning a hit."

        "Gus: I'm glad everything worked out all right; baby emma home safe and sound.",
        "Alan: Thanks to you. You made it all possible.",
        "Alexandra: So you found them?",
        "Alan: Yes, we did. Elizabeth had taken emma to see her father at ravenwood. It was all innocent.",
        "Gus: Let's just say no one got hurt.",
        "Alan: Yeah.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, I can't believe we have a brand-new baby in the family.",
        "Alan: Yes, a baby girl. And oh, you should see her. She is beautiful. I can't wait to see her again.",
        "Olivia: It's okay, sweetie. You know what? You're not going to have to deal with crazy lizzie or any of those people ever again. I'm going to have us packed and out of here in no time. I was so stupid to come back here in the first place. But it's okay because I'm going to get you away from those vultures.",
        "Lizzie: I just need to...",
        "Olivia: Don't ever even speak a word to me.",
        "Phillip: Olivia, calm down.",
        "Olivia: Calm down? My baby was snatched from her crib and taken god knows where",
        "Lizzie: I am not disturbed, olivia.",
        "Olivia: Oh, that's right. Only normal people kidnap babies.",
        "Phillip: Stop it. (Knock at door)",
        "Beth: We need to talk.",
        "Bill: All right. Well, if I haven't told you before, danny really appreciates your support. All right, thanks.",
        "Tony: Nice job, man.",
        "Bill: You know what, ton? I like people. I really do. And it really helps for a job like this. I'll tell you that much.",
        "Tony: Well, that's good.",
        "Bill: By the way, thank you very much for helping out today. We're really shorthanded.",
        "Tony: You don't need to thank me.",
        "Bill: I've also got to thank you for something else the other day.",
        "Tony: What's that?",
        "Bill: Oh, the little... you know, the little, \"if you want something, go for it\" pep talk we had.",
        "Tony: Oh, the pep talk. Yeah, yeah.",
        "Bill: The pep talk, the talk. You told me I was over-thinking and not to do that. Well, guess what I did?",
        "Tony: What?",
        "Bill: I asked eden to marry me. We're engaged. (Laughs) I can't believe it.",
        "Tony: Congratulations, man.",
        "Bill: Well, thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. In fact, I've got to go pick her up now. Do you mind hanging out a little bit?",
        "Tony: No. No, no. I got it.",
        "Bill: You all right? It's good?",
        "Tony: Take care.",
        "Bill: It's good? All right. Take care!",
        "Tony: Have a good one.",
        "Bill: Thanks again, buddy.",
        "Tony: Congratulations, eden. You got what you wanted.",
        "Billy: Hey.",
        "Tony: Hi, billy. What's going on? You just missed bill.",
        "Billy: Oh, that's okay. I came to see you.",
        "Christopher: You want me to hypnotize you?",
        "Reva: I want to save my daughter's life, and I think this is the one way to make it happen.",
        "Christopher: No. I already told you that...",
        "Reva: Christopher, I have to contact maryanne caruthers. You owe me.",
        "Christopher: Reva, this is not something you can force. It has to happen in its own time.",
        "Reva: I don't have the time! My daughter needs me to use this gift now. You have to help me make that happen. I'm going to trust you again.",
        "Christopher: All right.",
        "Reva: Okay. I know this can work. After carrie knocked me out in the tunnel, before rick and harley shook me awake, I was right on the edge of consciousness and maryanne came to me. I need to know if it's possible to recreate that sensation of being on the edge again.",
        "Christopher: Yes, but there's a possibility that this could go too far, reva. You'll be very vulnerable, not only psychically, but physically.",
        "Reva: I don't care.",
        "Josh: I do. I care. Somebody want to tell me what's going on here?",
        "Reva: You're telling me that you don't want me to do whatever I can to help our daughter?",
        "Josh: I'm telling you that we have enough trouble right now. We don't need you going off under some... into some time warp from which you may never return. I can't let you do this.",
        "Christopher: It is highly unlikely that anything like that would happen.",
        "Josh: You know what? \"Highly unlikely\" is not good enough.",
        "Reva: This could be the key to helping marah. I know it. Christopher knows what he's doing. I'll be fine. You need to probably leave.",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Reva: We have to get started.",
        "Josh: You know, I'm not going anywhere. If you're going to do this, if you're going to take this risk, I'm going to be here by your side.",
        "Reva: I don't know. I mean, is that okay?",
        "Josh: It's going to have to be okay.",
        "Christopher: I think it'll be okay.",
        "Reva: All right. Then we should get started. And I need to have you promise me that I won't slip so far to the other side that you can't bring me back.",
        "Christopher: I would never let that happen. Josh, why don't you sit here? All right. Now I'm going to count backwards from three to one. When I reach the number one, you will be fully in an alternate reality. Three... a reality where you will find all the answers that you seek. Two... you will make contact with maryanne caruthers, and you will see exactly what she wants you to see. One. Reva, can you hear me?",
        "Reva: Yes.",
        "Christopher: Where are you?",
        "Reva: I don't really know.",
        "Christopher: Your perception is clear, so take a look around and tell me where you are.",
        "Reva: It's light, but I can't really see anything.",
        "Maryanne: Reva? Reva? Reva?",
        "Christopher: Can you see anything now, reva?",
        "Reva: Maryanne!",
        "Josh: What is that? What is she doing?",
        "Christopher: Reva, no matter what happens you have to stay aware of my presence. Listen to my voice. I'll be right here beside you the whole time.",
        "Reva: I know, christopher.",
        "Christopher: Can you still see maryanne?",
        "Reva: Yes. She's still here, but I can't reach her.",
        "Christopher: Find your way to her. Don't push. Let it be on her terms. Let maryanne be your guide.",
        "Reva: Is that what you want, maryanne? You stay there. I'll come to you.",
        "Josh: Where is she going?",
        "Reva: Hi. I'm here. You look like you have a lot to tell me. That's why you keep coming to me. That's why I'm here. But it's not the only reason. My daughter's in trouble. You know that. I think you are, too. I can see it. Maybe we can help each other.",
        "Tony: You were looking for me? What's up?",
        "Billy: Well, I talked to josh, and he said that you offered to help my niece, and i just wondered what kind of help you're offering.",
        "Tony: Well, billy, what kind of help you need? You know I'd do anything for marah. You know that, right?",
        "Billy: Great. That's just what I wanted to hear. See, josh is going to play this by the rules, and I think it's time to think outside the box, and I'm hoping that's where you come in.",
        "Harley: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, what is that supposed to mean?",
        "Alan: Alexandra, what a difference it's made already in phillip's life. When he holds little emma, he lights up. I mean, it'S... and, of course, elizabeth and emma have been bonding. So all of the fears we had are totally unfounded.",
        "Gus: Look, I'm just really happy everything worked out well. So I'm going to go. I've got to go find harley. I'm going to give her the news. Now, shouldn't you two be getting under way, maybe going to the mall, picking out lots of little pink things for the kid?",
        "Alexandra: Hitting the mall, you say?",
        "Gus: You know what? Better yet, there is a discount outlet on highway nine. That's where harley gets all of zach and jude's stuff.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, dear. I'm not surprised.",
        "Gus: You want anything else? Can I help with anything else before I go?",
        "Alan: I think you've done enough, son. I'll check in with you later.",
        "Gus: I'll talk to you. That's discount outlet, highway nine. Normal folks go there.",
        "Alexandra: Well, alan, this has been quite a year for you, hasn't it? A new son, a new granddaughter.",
        "Alan: The spaulding family is expanding, alexandra. Elizabeth and phillip are getting better every day. I think the future of this family is brighter than ever.",
        "Alexandra: Reall? Well, I just wish the spauldings... spaulding company were faring as well.",
        "Alan: Do you have to rain on my parade?",
        "Alexandra: No, no. No, darling. I don't mean to. I'm sorry. It's just that I do want to remind you that emma can disappear as quickly as the price of spaulding stock, you know, if that hellcat of a mother of hers decides to maybe take her away again. (knocking on door)",
        "Phillip: Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Hey.",
        "Phillip: Hi, honey. I thought...",
        "Lizzie: You probably thought that I'd be behind bars by now, huh? Didn't you?",
        "Phillip: Oh, honey, what happened?",
        "Lizzie: Well, by the time we got home, everyone was so relieved that emma was okay that they didn't even pay any attention to me when I told them that I was going to go take a nap. So I had to get out of the house, daddy. I had to come see you. And daddy, I never would have hurt emma. I mean, I didn't know what to do when I first saw her, but you know I never, ever would have hurt her.",
        "Beth: I have some things i need to say to you.",
        "Olivia: I don't think this is a good time.",
        "Beth: How could you? How could you lie to this whole family? My god, what a fool I was. I cried for you when you said you'd lost your baby. How could you come up with a scheme like this and tell phillip that his baby was dead when you knew that he was in bad shape already? Didn't you know what it would do to him? Didn't you think that it would blow up in your face?",
        "Olivia: I came up with a scheme to try to keep your crazy daughter from stalking me and my baby.",
        "Beth: Lizzie wasn't stalking you. And when she took emma from this house, she did so so she could take her straight to phillip so she could help her father get better.",
        "Olivia: Please, spare me the party line.",
        "Beth: Hey, I know what lizzie did was wrong. I know she has issues. I know the two of you have problems. But I also know that this incident wasn't entirely her fault.",
        "Olivia: Kidnapping my baby wasn't her fault?",
        "Beth: No, it was your fault, too.",
        "Olivia: It was my fault, too? Yeah.",
        "Beth: If you had been honest with us from the beginning, lizzie wouldn't have had reason to take emma from this house, because emma would have already been part of the family.",
        "Olivia: You know something, beth? I don't want to be a part of this family. In fact, I wish I'd never laid eyes on a spaulding.",
        "Beth: Well, if you didn't, you wouldn't have that little girl over there. Hey, you think that I don't know what you're going through? Alan spent years trying to keep phillip and me apart. He tried every trick in the book.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, well, now look at you. You're the crown jewel of the spaulding collection.",
        "Beth: And it took years to find my place in the family.",
        "Olivia: And was it worth it, beth?",
        "Beth: Yeah, it was. Because now I have a family around my children that loves them and protects them, and they would do the same for emma if you would let them.",
        "Olivia: So you think that having a family like the spauldings is better than having no family at all. You are as crazy as your kid, and I want you to leave.",
        "Beth: No. No, olivia, I'm not going to leave. And neither are you.",
        "Alan: What would olivia have to gain by taking emma away from us? I mean, doesn't she want emma to be raised around a family?",
        "Alexandra: This may come as quite a shock to you, darling, but there are some people who believe that our family is a bit overbearing, controlling.",
        "Alan: I don't want to control emma. I just want to give her everything that comes with being a spaulding.",
        "Alexandra: I want her to have all of that, too, my dear, but olivia just may not see it that way.",
        "Alan: Don't forget, emma is also phillip's daughter, and he needs her. I mean, it'S... it's made a huge difference in his life, alexandra.",
        "Alexandra: Yes. Well, then, we have to convince olivia just to stay put.",
        "Alan: All right. I'll call my lawyers, and we'll make it impossible for her to make a move.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, alan, alan, please, you are way off base here. Now, if you don't listen to me, you will drive olivia away, and you will lose your granddaughter forever.",
        "Harley: You guys, marah does not need the kind of help you're talking about.",
        "Tony: And how would you know what kind of help we're talking about, harley?",
        "Harley: Because I know who I'm talking to, tony.",
        "Tony: Oh, okay.",
        "Harley: Billy, you can't do this.",
        "Billy: Look, all I know is i want to get my hands on the woman who caused those girls and the rest of us so much pain. I got my family into this; I'd like to get my family out.",
        "Harley: I know. That's what we all want. But you can't do it the way you're thinking. You've got to sit back. You've got to just let frank handle it, you know? Don't interfere in this investigation, please. You're going to hurt marah more than you're going to help her, trust me.",
        "Billy: I appreciate your concern. I think we're just coming at this from two different places, that's all. I'll be in touch, tony.",
        "Tony: Any time. Anything for marah, billy.",
        "Bill: Hey, dad. What's going on?",
        "Billy: Son, eden.",
        "Eden: Hi, billy.",
        "Billy: Hi. So how's things at the office?",
        "Bill: Oh, pretty good, pretty good. What are you doing here? Are you helping out with the campaign or...",
        "Billy: Oh, don't you wish? No, I actually came down here to try to scare up some help to find that carrie woman so we can get the charges against your cousin dropped, but I didn't have any luck.",
        "Bill: Right, right. Well, listen, is there anything I can do?",
        "Billy: No. You're doing just fine.",
        "Bill: All right.",
        "Billy: Taking care of the office is great. It takes a great load off my mind not having to worry about that. Are you okay? I mean, you look all... you look all flush, like you're carrying some big old secret around with you.",
        "Eden: Me? No, no secret.",
        "Billy: No secret?",
        "Eden: I'm worried about marah.",
        "Billy: Oh. You sure that's all?",
        "Bill: Come on, we've got to tell him.",
        "Eden: No.",
        "Bill: We've got to tell him. We've got to tell him. Dad, your son is getting married.",
        "Billy: You love my boy?",
        "Eden: More than anything. And I promise to spend the rest of my life making him happy.",
        "Billy: Well, that's all i need to hear. Come here. Well, congratulations.",
        "Bill: Thank you.",
        "Billy: You tell your mom yet?",
        "Bill: No, I haven't gotten around to it.",
        "Billy: You'd better get to it. Hey, this is great news. And that's something our family can use right now, some good news. See you.",
        "Bill: Well, what about that, huh? I told you he'd like you.",
        "Eden: Mmm.",
        "Harley: Tony, why don't you stay out of this? Because your kind of help is going to cause more problems than it's going to solve.",
        "Tony: What do you mean, \"my kind of help,\" harley? What does that mean?",
        "Harley: Let's not pretend. Everybody in town knows what kind of business you run.",
        "Tony: Really? What kind of business would that be? You tell me.",
        "Harley: Fine. Fine. I just don't want to see marah or anybody in her family hurt because somebody made a stupid move.",
        "Tony: Okay.",
        "Harley: That's all I'm saying.",
        "Tony: All right, fine. You can relax, because I'm not going to do anything to hurt marah. Well, what do you know? The happy couple now. Congratulations, eden. See you guys.",
        "Bill: Wow, that'S...",
        "Harley: Congratulations for what?",
        "Eden: Nicky didn't tell you?",
        "Harley: Obviously not.",
        "Eden: We're engaged.",
        "Bill: Yep.",
        "Harley: Wow. That's terrific.",
        "Bill: Well, thank you very much. Come on, show her the ring. You can show her the ring. Show her the ring.",
        "Harley: And gus knows about this?",
        "Gus: Hey, people! Hello.",
        "Eden: Hi.",
        "Gus: Honey, I got some news. Wait until you hear.",
        "Harley: Wait until you hear my news. Eden and bill are engaged, but i guess you already know about that.",
        "Bill: Looks like it's going to be a race to the altar.",
        "Reva: My god. Christopher...",
        "Christopher: Tell me what's happening. Tell me where you are.",
        "Reva: I'm there.",
        "Christopher: Where, reva?",
        "Reva: The fairgrounds. I'm in her world. There's music, laughter. I'm seeing everything maryanne saw the night she died.",
        "Christopher: Maryanne brought you back to observe.",
        "Reva: I'm not here to observe. I'm here to bear witness. Joshua?",
        "Josh: I'm right here, reva.",
        "Reva: No. You're there. I see you. You're so young, so earnest.",
        "Christopher: Does maryanne like talking to him?",
        "Reva: They're talking about the fair, about springfield. She has all the money she wants. She can go anywhere she wants. But she loves springfield. She's happy here. She's so happy. It seems like she's out here for the first time in a very long time. Oh, no.",
        "Christopher: What, reva?",
        "Reva: It's her. Carrie. All-new -- beyonce, mi",
        "Alan: Well, aren't you going to tell me how to solve this problem with emma and olivia?",
        "Alexandra: Of course. And I would love to, darling, but you'll never buy my theory.",
        "Alan: Try me. I will listen.",
        "Alexandra: Oh...",
        "Alan: I mean, both of us want phillip to come home to a very happy family, be happy with his family, and we want emma to be a part of this family, so...",
        "Alexandra: I want emma to be a part of this family. We all do, of course. But we won't get it by going after olivia like a couple of rabid dogs.",
        "Alan: Is this the speech where I'm supposed to use honey instead of vinegar to get what i want?",
        "Alexandra: That's the one. I say, darling, we take it even one step further and we give olivia everything she wants.",
        "Olivia: Now get the hell out of my house. Just leave me alone so I can...",
        "Beth: So you can run away? Then what?",
        "Olivia: You're just as bad as the rest of them. You come into my house, you insult me, you tell me I can't take care of my baby. I want you to leave now.",
        "Beth: Don't worry. I'm almost finished.",
        "Olivia: Get it out of your system. Tell me why I should stay in springfield.",
        "Beth: Oh, no, olivia. I don't want you to stay in springfield, believe me. If it were up to me, I would drive you to the airport myself, and I would put you on a plane to a destination of your choice. But it's not about me. It's about phillip. And I don't know what would happen to him if he lost emma now that he's found her. He may fall apart again, and i cannot, i will not let that happen again. I love him, and I want him to be happy. I need him to be healthy for my children. Lizzie and james need him. Emma needs him. So you think about it. I know what I want for my children. You need to decide what you want for yours.",
        "Lizzie: When I first saw emma, the only thing I could think was, \"I've got to get her out of here. I've got to get her away from olivia.\" And I just knew that if we could get to you. Then everything would be okay.",
        "Phillip: I can't tell you how much it means to me that you still feel that way, that you feel like I can protect you. Because I know I haven't been much good at that lately.",
        "Lizzie: Daddy, you protected me today. You took my side against everyone.",
        "Phillip: Yeah, well, you know, I'm not crazy about the fact that you scared everybody, and I don't want you to make decisions that cause you pain. But I couldn't just let them gang up on you. I'm always going to be on your side.",
        "Lizzie: And I'm on your side, too. Well, you're feeling better, aren't you? I mean, you... you know, you seem more like yourself.",
        "Phillip: I'm getting there.",
        "Lizzie: You're not really going to go back living with olivia or anything when you leave here, are you?",
        "Phillip: She's my wife.",
        "Lizzie: Dad, that's a technicality.",
        "Phillip: Honey, we'll just... we'll have to see how it goes, okay? So how do you like having a little sister?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, are you kidding? I love it. I mean, at first, I wasn't so sure, but she's really great.",
        "Phillip: She does look exactly like you when you were a baby. She does.",
        "Lizzie: Tell that to olivia. She'll go nuts. So, does anyone else know about her besides us? Have you told uncle rick yet?",
        "Phillip: Not yet.",
        "Lizzie: He's going to love that, the two of you having a little baby girl together. Mom and nana said his baby's really cute, too. Maybe I could even baby-sit them? I mean, I guess I'd never really considered that before, but for them...",
        "Phillip: Hey, think about how much they're going to look up to you.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. They will, won't they?",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm.",
        "Lizzie: I mean, I could take them shopping or I could get their ears pierced. Or I could... there's lots of stuff.",
        "Phillip: Everything's going to be okay, honey. We're going to be together, and we're going to take care of each other. And that's all that matters.",
        "Lizzie: That's what you want, isn't it, for us to be together?",
        "Phillip: We're a family.",
        "Lizzie: Yes, we are.",
        "Phillip: Hey, where are you going?",
        "Lizzie: Well, today you took care of me, and now it's my turn to take care of you. I'm going to have to figure out some way to get along with olivia.",
        "Phillip: Good luck.",
        "Harley: Well, I've got to get back to work, you guys, because I'm manning the phones. And you look like you could use some sleep.",
        "Gus: Yeah, I would love to have some sleep.",
        "Bill: Hey, you know what we should do? Go out and celebrate sometime. Have a nice little dinner, the four of us, you know? All right, well, I'll call you, okay? But we've got some more campaigning to do out there, so we'll catch you later, all right?",
        "Gus: All right.",
        "Bill: Take care.",
        "Gus: All right. Are you ready for the news?",
        "Harley: First, I have a couple of issues that I'd like to discuss with you.",
        "Reva: Carrie shows up and the whole world tilts. Her energy is so intense, twisted. She's so angry, domineering. Maryanne feels claustrophobic. I sense what she feels. I feel it myself.",
        "Christopher: Just relax, reva, and breathe deeply. What you're feeling is a vision from the past. It isn't reality. In reality you are here with me.",
        "Reva: But it feels... maryanne's so trapped. She feels so trapped and angry.",
        "Christopher: It's not real, reva. You have to remember there are two of you. You are here with me. Maryanne is not.",
        "Reva: She's hurting her. Carrie wants her to come home, but maryanne wants to be left alone. She's begging for her freedom. Don't send her away. Let her stay. She wants to stay. But aunt carrie keeps insisting. Maryanne, maryanne! Come back! I can't find you. I don't feel right. Something's not right.",
        "Reva: Maryanne feels so dizzy, hot. I feel so dizzy.",
        "Christopher: No, reva. Maryanne feels dizzy.",
        "Josh: Alan had drugged the beer.",
        "Christopher: You are right here with me in your own house.",
        "Reva: I'm in a car. I'm going too fast. It's raining. Stop the car. I can't see. Slow down.",
        "Josh: Okay, you have to stop this right now.",
        "Christopher: All right, reva. I'm going to count backwards from three. And as I count, you are going to pull yourself out of this deep vision and into the light of reality. Three... you're coming back now. You're separating yourself from maryanne's experiences. Two...",
        "Reva: Someone open a window. Someone open a window, please. It's hot.",
        "Christopher: Reva, reva, you need to come back now. It's over. Back into your reality. Back into your body when I clap my hands. One. Reva?",
        "Reva: I feel so lightheaded.",
        "Christopher: Oh, god. You had me as scared as I've ever been.",
        "Josh: It's all right, darling. It's over. It's finished.",
        "Reva: Slow down, alan. Slow down. Slow down.",
        "Josh: I'm not alan, reva. It's me. It's josh.",
        "Reva: Slow down the car.",
        "Josh: Reva, it's josh.",
        "Reva: Joshua, tell him to stop. I want to get out. I want to get out of the car. Stop. You're going too fast! Stop the car!",
        "Josh: Reva...",
        "Reva: Stop the car!",
        "Josh: Reva, come back now. Reva! (Sounds of car crash)",
        "Reva: Ooh, it's so cold. It's so cold.",
        "Josh: Reva, come back. Come back to us, reva. Reva, come on back. It's okay. It's okay. It's all right.",
        "Reva: I have to get out of the water.",
        "Josh: Reva...",
        "Reva: I have to get out of the water! It's too cold, I have to get out. It's too cold!",
        "Josh: Reva!",
        "Reva: It's too cold! I've got to get out!",
        "Josh: Please...",
        "Reva: I've got to get out. I've got to get out! (Coughing) you survived. Why didn't they see you? You got out of that car alive. The angels were with you that night.",
        "Maryanne: Then they left me.",
        "Reva: They left me. I didn't die, and they left me.",
        "Josh: You have got to end this right now.",
        "Christopher: Reva, it's time to let go now. Come back, reva.",
        "Reva: They left me.",
        "Josh: Reva?",
        "Maryanne: They left me.",
        "Reva: They left me.",
        "Maryanne: Why did you leave me?",
        "Reva: Why did you leave me?",
        "Carrie: I didn't leave you, maryanne. I'd never leave you. I'm here, maryanne. I'm here now. And nothing, nothing is going to hurt you again ever. I promise you, maryanne, i promise you.",
        "Olivia: Well, I don't know what to do. There's a part of me that just wants to scoop you up and take you so far away from here. And there's another part that thinks that that's selfish, because you deserve a daddy. He loves you so much, em. And you deserve a family, no matter how crazy they are. And I think I can keep you safe here, you know, with their help. Problem is I have a hard time tolerating them, and so if i stay here, I'm probably just going to go crazy, and that's not going to be good for either one of us. Oh, honey, I wish you could tell me the right thing to do.",
        "Alexandra: Well, we have to convince olivia the important thing is that she and emma are very happy here in springfield.",
        "Alan: Well, this will require quite an acting job on my part, because there's nothing I would enjoy more than never seeing olivia again.",
        "Alexandra: Ah, but unfortunately, they come as a package deal, at least for the time being.",
        "Alan: Hmm. Well, once phillip gets back on his feet and returns, we will all three put our heads together and come up with the right plan, I'm sure. But, alexandra, in the meantime, I think gus had a very good idea. Why don't we go on a shopping spree for emma? I mean, it sounds like fun.",
        "Alexandra: It is. It's absolutely a lovely idea. Yes, we've got to cover all our bases before we make a pitch.",
        "Alan: After you.",
        "Alexandra: Thank you.",
        "Harley: I can't believe you didn't tell me about eden and bill. What secrets are you keeping from me?",
        "Gus: I'm not keeping any secrets. I've hardly seen you at all. My father called me over to help with the whole lizzie catastrophe. I don't think that means I'm keeping any secrets.",
        "Harley: What about lizzie? What's going on with her?",
        "Gus: She's fine, she's fine. The bottom line is she's got a new little sister. Olivia's baby is alive.",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Gus: Yes. Olivia was keeping the baby away from the family, away from spaulding, because she was afraid what lizzie was going to do.",
        "Harley: Oh, my gosh. I'm not saying that I'm on olivia's side, but I can't say i blame her, because I might do the same thing if somebody was after my kid.",
        "Gus: Lizzie took the baby, took her out of olivia's house. But only over to ravenwood to show phillip and kind of, you know, snap him out of his trance. But the thing is it kind of worked. This is one of those things that's like a happy ending. Bottom line is I have a new little niece, and her name is emma.",
        "Harley: That's nice.",
        "Gus: It's just... there's a lot of changes going on, you know?",
        "Harley: Yeah, there is a lot of changes going on. Got to hand it to lizzie, though, I'll tell you. No matter what you say about her, when she wants something, she sure finds what she's after.",
        "Gus: Well, she's like a little detective.",
        "Harley: I could use a detective like that on this caroline caruthers case, because the longer time goes by, the less likely it is we're going to find her alive, and then I don't know what's going to happen with marah.",
        "Reva: She's here with me.",
        "Josh: Mary... maryanne is...",
        "Reva: Aunt carrie. She found me after the accident. She found me on the riverbank.",
        "Josh: What is she... what is she doing? What is carrie doing?",
        "Reva: Holding us tight. So tight. So tight.",
        "Josh: Reva? Reva?",
        "Reva: I can't breathe!",
        "Josh: Reva?",
        "Carrie: I won't allow your life to be ruined by these people, by these people who don't love you, by these people who could never, ever love you as much as I do. Never, maryanne, never. Never.",
        "Josh: Reva?",
        "Christopher: Reva?",
        "Josh: What the hell is going on?",
        "Christopher: I don't know! It's never happened before.",
        "Josh: Reva! Reva! Reva! She's not breathing. Get her down here. Reva! Reva? Reva?",
        "Josh: Next on \"guiding light.\"",
        "Blake: Ross, it's not like you to get the jitters. You want to tell me exactly what's going on?",
        "Bill: I'm his campaign manager, okay, honey, and it's part of my job, okay? I've got to get him ready for the fight. And between you and me, looks like danny really has a fight on his hands.",
        "Josh: Darling, are you there? Reva, come on.",
        "Rick: Pulse is faint. How long was she under?",
        "Christopher: Not long, but she went through some sort of trauma."
