        "bill: What are you doing?",
        "Harley: Hey. I was... I was actually just upstairs watching the boys sleep. You know, trying to suck up every last minute bit of them that i can. But I kept waking them up, because I was kissing on them, smelling them, snuggling them. ( Laughs ) mostly though I'm just trying to avoid gus. He's not making that very easy.",
        "Bill: What are you going to do, harley? The guys loves you, you know.",
        "Harley: A lot of good that's going to do him. I'm going to prison and if he doesn't get on with his life, he will lose everything else.",
        "Gus: Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second?",
        "Bill: Come on, gus. You've got to back off. Harley doesn't want to talk to you right now.",
        "Olivia: Billy, billy, billy. You hired this big nasty thug to beat up on phillip. You are a bad boy.",
        "Billy: Billy lewis.",
        "Olivia: It's olivia lewis. How are you doing, dad? I was wondering if you were available for a meeting.",
        "Billy: What kind of meeting?",
        "Olivia: Call it a meeting of the minds. If you need some incentive, it involves your son.",
        "Alan: Sebastian, why don't we go to the country club? I'm a member there.",
        "Sebastian: No, no, no. I like this spot. Sentimental reasons, you know. You know what? I almost died about right there. Let me tell you something, alan, old boy. Nothing like a near death experience to put a little bounce into your life.",
        "Alan: I robbed death a couple times myself. Heart attacks. I had my first heart attack right before my first grandson was born. I think that may be the reason why phillip named him after me.",
        "Sebastian: You miss him very much, phillip, don't you?",
        "Alan: More than i can say.",
        "Sebastian: Well, you must feel a certain closure now that harley's cooper been convicted. Yeah?",
        "Alan: Never. Harley's cooper been convicted. Yeah?",
        "Alan: Never. But now that harley's in prison it will give me more time to devote to the other people who hurt phillip. And believe me, sebastian, they will all pay.",
        "Michelle: So what's going on here?",
        "Tony: What's going on with you? Hey. Take a seat. What's going on? What happened to you?",
        "Michelle: I'm fine.",
        "Tony: Are you okay?",
        "Michelle: I'm okay. I just got...",
        "Tony: Huh?",
        "Michelle: I'm so sorry.",
        "Tony: Hey, hey. It's okay. It's all right. You're home. All right, you're where you belong. All right, whatever happened it's over. It's okay.",
        "Michelle: I've got to tell you what happened.",
        "Tony: Okay, that's fine. You could tell me on the way to the hospital. I want to get you looked at.",
        "Michelle: No, no, no, i'm okay. Tony okay. Come on, please.",
        "Michelle: I don't need to go to the hospital.",
        "Tony: Hey, will you... Michelle, will you let me take care of you, please? You have no idea what's been going on through my head. You have no idea. All right. What's going on? You're trembling. Okay, I need you to tell me what's going on. Please tell me.",
        "Michelle: Tony...",
        "Tony: What?",
        "Michelle: I almost lost you tonight.",
        "Tony: That's not going to happen. Come here.",
        "Michelle: I remember my mom dying. God, it's coming back to me so fast.",
        "Danny: What is?",
        "Michelle: You. I remember loving you.",
        "Marina: Hey.",
        "Danny: Marina. Hi. I am so sorry.",
        "Marina: Okay. That's a good start because i don't know whether to be relieved that you're alive or angry at your nerve for even showing up.",
        "Danny: Look, something happened tonight. Something I need to tell you about.",
        "michelle: There was an accident tonight at the townhouse that danny's constructing.",
        "Marina: What kind of accident?",
        "Danny: Some beams that were supporting the roof gave way. The whole thing collapsed.",
        "Michelle: And i was right underneath it.",
        "Tony: My god, michelle. I recommended that construction team to danny. Michelle, hey, you could have been... You could have been killed.",
        "Michelle: I wasn'T. I wasn't. I mean, physically i'm okay. You know, once all the dust cleared.",
        "Danny: And michelle and i wound up under a whole bunch of debris.",
        "Marina: Is she okay?",
        "Danny: Yeah, she's fine. She's fine.",
        "Tony: What was danny thinking? He should have taken you... He should have taken you to cedars.",
        "Michelle: Tony, we were both in shock. You know...",
        "Tony: I'm just glad that he was with you, okay.",
        "Michelle: Yes. So am I.",
        "Danny: I just... I felt like i really couldn't leave until i was sure that michelle was okay.",
        "Marina: You don't need to explain.",
        "Danny: I'm just so sorry. I really am. I feel terrible.",
        "Marina: I'm just grateful that you weren't hurt.",
        "Michelle: I'm so sorry.",
        "Tony: Relax.",
        "Michelle: There was really no way I could get in touch with you.",
        "Tony: Hey, it's okay. All right, you're home safe now. And that's all that matters. If i had lost you, michelle, i don't know what I would have done.",
        "Michelle: You haven't. You haven't lost me, okay. I'm right here. I'm right here with you.",
        "Marina: It just scares me to think of what could have happened to you.",
        "Danny: I'm okay. I am. I'm fine. It's over. There's nothing to be scared of.",
        "Gus: This has nothing to do with you, bill. This is between harley and me.",
        "Bill: Need a little backup?",
        "Harley: Yes.",
        "Gus: You need a little backup?",
        "Bill: Look, gus, you're killing her. She shouldn't have to worry about you at this point, that's all.",
        "Gus: No offense, bill, but you don't know what you're talking about. So why don't you take a hike.",
        "Bill: Listen to me. I know what harley's told me. She's got a couple of days left with her boys and her family and she would like for you to be able to move on and take care of yourself. And, gus, if you really did love her, you'll do that. You'd honor her wishes. Harley, if you need anything just give me a call. Okay.",
        "Harley: Thanks.",
        "Gus: Is that true? I'm hurting you by trying to help you?",
        "Harley: Yes. The answer is yes.",
        "Olivia: Can i get a scotch on rocks?",
        "Sebastian: There she is, our lady president.",
        "Alan: Yes. Olivia probably hurt phillip more than all the rest of them put together.",
        "Sebastian: Yeah, but harley pulled the trigger.",
        "Alan: Olivia killed his spirit. From the moment they met, it was the beginning of the end of my son.",
        "Sebastian: And she'll be punished for that?",
        "Alan: She's already wondering where and when i'm going to strike next. All I have to do is add a little pressure and she'll go right over the side.",
        "Sebastian: Well, alan, i would like to think that my father would have channeled his love to hurt people in my name.",
        "Alan: Your father would have unleashed a plague.",
        "Sebastian: ( Laughs ) thank you, alan. That is very kind of you to say. Shall we get to work?",
        "Olivia: Golly, is this boy's night out?",
        "Sebastian: Well, boys night out is always more titillating when a gorgeous woman appears.",
        "Alan: I've asked sebastian to meet with me because i'm thinking about targeting a new company for spaulding to acquire.",
        "Olivia: Is that right? And I wasn't included because?",
        "Alan: Conflict of interest possibly. You see I'm going after lewis construction.",
        "Olivia: ( Laughs ) that's very funny.",
        "Alan: Is it? But you know, olivia, if you want to join me, i would love to have your assistance.",
        "Olivia: Alan, this is ridiculous.",
        "Alan: Really?",
        "Olivia: Yeah. And it's totally unnecessary.",
        "Sebastian: Nah, i've already come up with the way to rest the business out from under the...",
        "Olivia: You don't want lewis. You just want to put bill in his place and destroy my marriage.",
        "Alan: Well, i don't think you need any help in that area.",
        "Olivia: Oh, you know, i can't even...",
        "Sebastian: Livvy. Livvy.",
        "Olivia: Livvy?",
        "Sebastian: You don't have to get your hands dirty in this. I'll take care of it.",
        "Olivia: So nice of you to be concerned about me, sebastian. But I'm not afraid of a little dirt. I'm in.",
        "Tony: You know, it still is our night even though it got off to kind of a shaky start. ( Chuckles )",
        "michelle: Well you should know that it would take a lot more than a building falling down on me to wipe me out.",
        "Tony: That I am now figuring out. I love you. I love you so much. I couldn't imagine living without you. Hey, that is kind of supposed to make a little happy.",
        "Michelle: I am happy. Very happy.",
        "Tony: Are you sure?",
        "Michelle: Mm-hmm.",
        "Tony: Okay. Then this is just the beginning. Come with me. I want you to sit right here.",
        "Michelle: What are you doing? You already asked me.",
        "Tony: I took care of a few lose ends. I talked to robbie. Little man gave me his blessing. Well, I guess you could say he more or less jumped in my lap and said, \"yeah, this is great.\" I promised him a big wedding. That's yours.",
        "Michelle: Tony. It's beautiful.",
        "Tony: Not only are you beautiful, but you deserve the best. Will you marry me?",
        "Michelle: I'm just... Oh, god, i'm so overwhelmed. I don't know what to say right now.",
        "Tony: You don't have to say anything. Come here. Because you said enough. You agreed to be my wife and you love me. That's all i need. That's all i need. In fact, i don't want to wait because I can't wait to be your husband.",
        "Alan: You mean, olivia, you're willing to sell out your in-laws?",
        "Olivia: In a heartbeat.",
        "Sebastian: ( Laughs ) olivia, you are an incredible woman.",
        "Olivia: Well, finally, we agree on something, huh? Billy lewis has it coming. I hate doing it to josh, but i want to keep my place at spaulding as well as my family.",
        "Alan: Well, i would expect no less from you.",
        "Olivia: Well, i learned from the master, alan. Besides I trust you way more than i trust billy.",
        "Alan: Because i'm a known quantity?",
        "Olivia: Oh, because at least in you, bill and i have a common enemy.",
        "Alan: Wait, wait, wait. You're going to leave before we start the strategy session?",
        "Olivia: Well, you know what? I am way ahead of you. So what else is new?",
        "Sebastian: Bye. Was she like that when you were married to her?",
        "Alan: She hasn't changed a bit, and that is what I'm counting on.",
        "Billy: You look a little ragged. What's going on? You got trouble at home?",
        "Bill: Stop that. Will you, please?",
        "Billy: Okay. All right. Okay.",
        "Bill: Come on.",
        "Billy: Well, if it's not at home, then what is it?",
        "Bill: I've been spending a lot of time with harley lately, especially after the sentencing. So...",
        "Billy: I know. That was a tough break.",
        "Bill: Yeah. I tell she's something else. I mean with everything she's got going on, facing prison and all, she can still keep her priorities straight. Everything is about her family and her kids, making things right before she has to say \"good bye.\" I don't know. She's showed me that i've taken she's showed me that i've taken a lot for granted, i'll tell you that much.",
        "Billy: Like what?",
        "Bill: Well, like, you know, being a lewis, you know? I mean, I've got my own family. I love olivia and emma. I do. But sometimes I wish... I don't know. Sometimes I wish things were a little different, that's all. But anyway how are you and josh fixed for work around here? You got everything covered?",
        "Billy: ( Laughs ) oh, yeah, right. Would I still be working if i did? Wanda's swamped. And sandy, he's doing his share, but, you know, he's overworked.",
        "Bill: Right, right, right. So maybe... I don't know, maybe you could use an extra hand.",
        "Billy: I mean, you know someone?",
        "Bill: Well, you know, you're looking at him. That is if you're hiring. No pressure.",
        "Billy: ( Laughs ) you're hired.",
        "Bill: All right.",
        "Danny: I'm sorry about chicago. I am. We could still go.",
        "Marina: Tonight?",
        "Danny: Mm-hmm.",
        "Marina: No. No, danny, it's too late. But there'll be other nights, right? It's no big deal.",
        "Danny: I promise I will make it up to you.",
        "Marina: Yes, you will.",
        "Danny: You're really amazing, you know that?",
        "Marina: What can I say. I'm one of a kind. You're a lucky guy.",
        "Danny: It's true. Thank you for being so understanding.",
        "Marina: Please, it's all an act. I pretended to be all low maintenance and once i get you under my spell, I break out to be the diva from hell.",
        "Danny: Oh. Oh, I can't wait to see that.",
        "Marina: Mm-hmm.",
        "Danny: No, really. You just make things very simple.",
        "Marina: Sounds boring.",
        "Danny: No, no, no, no, no. It's anything but.",
        "Tony: Are you sure that you're okay with this? You want to go somewhere else or anything?",
        "Michelle: This is fine. I'm starving.",
        "Danny: Hey.",
        "Tony: Hey.",
        "Michelle: Hi.",
        "Danny: How are you feeling?",
        "Michelle: I'm good. Good. Just like new.",
        "Harley: It doesn't matter what we want or feel. It can't happen now. I'm going to prison. Maybe for life.",
        "Gus: I'M... See i'm going to find phillip's murderer and when i do...",
        "Harley: You know what? We may never know whet happened the night that phillip was shot. And you can't put your life on hold hoping to make it come out the way you want. Then it's like we're both in prison.",
        "Gus: Can I just ask you a favor? Can we just not argue about this tonight, please? I mean, we have such a little amount of time. Can you just come back to my apartment? Come on.",
        "Harley: I can't. I can't do that. I can't do that. I can't be alone with you.",
        "Gus: What are you afraid of? What?",
        "Harley: Of leaving you with the hope of something that will never happen. Holding you when i have to let you go. Making love to you when I should be saying good-bye. I can't do that. I love you too much to do that to you.",
        "Gus: Can you just do me a favor, please? Can you just hold on to the love part, okay, and I'll handle the rest. Before i met you, I didn't even have a family. I had nothing. Then i had love, and i had a family, and I can't just, like, let it go, you know. I'm going to help zach and jude. I'm going to teach them how to play basketball and I'm going to help marina, like, college course out and stuff like that and I'm going to build your house. I'm going to make it perfect. And when you come home and you know... That's not me ruining my life or anything like that. That's making my life. That gives me a reason to wake up every single morning. So don't... Don't make me...",
        "Harley: Gus! Call a paramedic! Coming up on \"guiding light.\"",
        "Bill: So talk business.",
        "Olivia: Maybe it's me, but i have a feeling when the news hits the stand it's going to be bye-bye billy and bye-bye lewis construction.",
        "Harley: Wait with me. Be here when he wakes up. He needs someone, and you owe me. He has to start living without me.",
        "Paramedic #1: What happened?",
        "Harley: He fell... Like he fainted. He has an ulcer, so I...",
        "Gus: I'm okay.",
        "Harley: You're ridiculous. They're taking you to the hospital.",
        "Paramedic #1: Sir, we're going to make sure everything's all right.",
        "Paramedic #2: Did he hit his head or anything?",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Paramedic #1: Okay, let's do it.",
        "Gus: Harley.",
        "Harley: I'm here. I'm coming with you. I'm right here.",
        "Holly: How nice to see you making friends.",
        "Sebastian: ( Laughs )",
        "holly: Are you playing well with others?",
        "Sebastian: Well, if it isn't my favorite shadow. Help me out here, holly. I'm trying to get alan to join the land of the living.",
        "Holly: Come on, play some pool. I'll buy the drinks.",
        "Sebastian: Hmm. Tempting offer. I'd take her up on it.",
        "Danny: Michelle, what happened tonight was... It was pretty traumatic and you should take it easy.",
        "Michelle: Well, how are you doing?",
        "Danny: Me? I'm fine.",
        "Tony: Listen, i wanted to say thank you for what you did for michelle.",
        "Danny: I'm just glad I was there. And... Hey, by the way, congratulations on your engagement.",
        "Tony: Thank you. Thank you. I'm happy.",
        "Marina: I hope you guys are really happy.",
        "Tony: Well, you know...",
        "Danny: Big news.",
        "Michelle: Thanks. Thank you, thank you.",
        "Tony: Okay. All right, show her the ring. Show her the ring.",
        "Michelle: Oh, you know, it's so new, I forget i'm even wearing it.",
        "Marina: Wow. That's beautiful.",
        "Michelle: Thank you. Tony's got really good taste. Let's go inside.",
        "Tony: All right. You sure?",
        "Michelle: Yeah.",
        "Tony: You guys, want to join us?",
        "Danny: No, no, that's all right. No, you two go ahead.",
        "Tony: Okay. All right.",
        "Bill: So where do i start?",
        "Billy: Well, you start by sitting in that desk right over there.",
        "Bill: Oh, no. That's okay. I don'T...",
        "Billy: Go, go. Yes, yes. I'm going to get the plans for that new industrial complex, okay.",
        "Bill: All right.",
        "Billy: Hey. It's really good to have you back.",
        "Bill: It's good to be back.",
        "Olivia: You're still hard at it?",
        "Billy: Oh, you just don't take no for an answer, do you?",
        "Olivia: It's not in my nature.",
        "Billy: This probably isn't a good time.",
        "Olivia: Well, make time.",
        "Billy: No, no. I want to tell you something.",
        "Olivia: Really? My news first.",
        "Billy: What's this?",
        "Olivia: Read it. You might want to grab a seat first before it gets pulled out from under you.",
        "Billy: Well, I'd say you've been a busy little girl.",
        "Olivia: I'd say you've been the busy one, billy. You're running an international corporation, you've managed to turn yourself into a one man wrecking ball to destroy my marriage, and yet you still manage to find the time to hire some thug to break phillip's knee caps.",
        "Billy: I don't think you could prove that.",
        "Olivia: Yes, I can. I'll give harris any amount of money he wants and he will sing any tune i want.",
        "Billy: What is it you want?",
        "Olivia: Your portion of lewis.",
        "Billy: ( Laughs ) in your dreams.",
        "Olivia: ( Laughs ) those papers say differently.",
        "Billy: Does bill know you're up to this?",
        "Olivia: Not anymore than he knows about the thug you hired. But he can and he will, unless we could come to terms.",
        "Billy: Okay. Let's talk business. So you feel pretty sure of yourself about getting my part of the business here. I think I might have to rethink everything, because I don't think you have enough cash.",
        "Olivia: It's not about cash, billy. I could put away for conspiracy, attempted assault. Who knows what else.",
        "Billy: Go for it. I ain't budging.",
        "Olivia: Fine. Have it your way. I'll just go to the da and i'll tell them that you hired some thug to beat up phillip spaulding. Maybe it's me, but i'll have a feeling when the news hits the stand, it's going to be bye-bye lewis construction.",
        "Sebastian: Whoa!",
        "Alan: Well, it's been awhile.",
        "Holly: You could have fooled me.",
        "Sebastian: Well, I guess the next round of drinks is on me.",
        "Holly: Hurts to lose.",
        "Sebastian: Not a word about this in that article you're writing or i'm going to have to sue the \"journal.\"",
        "Holly: Hmm.",
        "Alan: Holly, you want to take on the winner? I mean, you talked me into this. What have you got to lose?",
        "Holly: Actually very little.",
        "Alan: Good.",
        "Holly: Ah.",
        "Alan: Whoa. Very good. Well, that was a pleasant surprise.",
        "Holly: Oh, I'm full of them.",
        "Alan: Yeah.",
        "Holly: So tell me how is sebastian working out at spaulding?",
        "Alan: As matter fact, very well. Roger's probably rolling over in his grave.",
        "Holly: Yeah. Your drink?",
        "Alan: And how is sebastian working out for you?",
        "Holly: Oh, this is strictly professional. I'm doing a story on him for the \"journal.\"",
        "Alan: Oh, is that so?",
        "Holly: Nice.",
        "Alan: So tell me, this article that you're writing, i assume we won't be seeing it anytime soon.",
        "Holly: Why do you say that?",
        "Alan: Unbiased journalism isn't what it used to be. Tell me something. Why are you following him around?",
        "Holly: I'm doing my job.",
        "Alan: Oh, really?",
        "Holly: Mm.",
        "Alan: Well, you know, my experience is that work interests and personal needs sometime overlap, and I think that's true about you. That's one thing that roger and i had in common. We both appreciated that side of you.",
        "Michelle: I'm going to go get us some more napkins, okay?",
        "Tony: Okay.",
        "Michelle: Excuse me.",
        "Danny: You didn't tell tony.",
        "Michelle: No, i... I... No, i didn't. I was going to tell him, but...",
        "Danny: Okay, okay. No, there's no need to explain.",
        "Michelle: I'm going to tell him. I am. That i got my memory back. Did you tell marina?",
        "Danny: No, not yet.",
        "Michelle: It's kind of funny, because I remember how close marina and i were. Strange how everything can be really clear and yet very confusing all at the same time.",
        "Danny: Michelle, you need to take things one step at a time.",
        "Michelle: I just want to be with robbie, you know, and i want him to know that his mommy's back. You know, really back.",
        "Danny: Well, he'll feel that. He will. And it's important that we don't confuse him because we've worked really hard to make things as easy for him to understand as possible.",
        "Michelle: You're right. You're right. You're always really good about him. I should go.",
        "Danny: That's a nice ring.",
        "Michelle: Yeah. Mm-hmm.",
        "Danny: Tony seems really happy about the engagement. I don't think I've seen him like this, ever.",
        "Michelle: I'd never hurt him if that's what you're thinking.",
        "Danny: No, no, I wasn't.",
        "Michelle: Well, i mean, you don't want to hurt marina. You guys... You guys are really close.",
        "Danny: Right. That's true. That's true, you're right. Our lives are different now. Things are different.",
        "Michelle: Yeah.",
        "Marina: I'm really happy for you and michelle.",
        "Tony: Well, thank you. We have a lot to be thankful for.",
        "Michelle: Hi. You ready to go? All set.",

        "Danny: See you.",
        "Marina: It's back isn't it? Michelle's memory?",
        "Danny: It is that obvious?",
        "Marina: I can tell by the way she looks at you.",
        "Danny: Yeah. It's back.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, harley, I got here as fast i could. What's happened?",

        "Alexandra: Well, what can i do?",
        "Harley: Wait with me. Be here when he wakes up.",
        "Alexandra: Well, I don't know if i'm the one...",
        "Harley: I can't stay, alex. He needs someone, and you owe me. You don't understand. I cannot be here when he wakes up. He has to start living without me.",
        "Alexandra: All right. I really don't want you to start thinking this way because, you know, it's a good chance...",
        "Harley: I'm just being realistic. I'm going away for a long time, and he needs someone he can count on. You're the only one in that family i can think of. The only one with half a heart.",
        "Alexandra: Half a heart's better than none, I guess. Of course, i'll be here with gus. Harley, I want you to know that i will do anything to help this family now.",
        "Harley: Good, because i'm counting on you.",
        "Rick: Hey.",
        "Harley: Is he going to be all right?",
        "Rick: We'll know more when we get the test results back. In the meantime I've given him something to help him rest.",
        "Harley: What is wrong with him? Is it his heart?",
        "Rick: No, i think his heart is fine. I think it's the same thing that brought him here last time, which is he has an ulcer and he's exhausted. Now both are treatable if he allowed himself to be treated. Harley, I tried and tried to talk some sense into him last time, but he wouldn't listen to me. I mean, the man lives on coffee, cigarettes and no sleep.",
        "Harley: I know.",
        "Rick: All right, the first order of business is he absolutely has to take this condition seriously. This is the second time that he has passed out.",
        "Alexandra: Well, that's the second time that we know about.",

        "Alan: I don't think i'm ready for that.",
        "Holly: No, no, but it would help.",
        "Sebastian: Don't push him, darling.",
        "Holly: Let me know if you change your mind.",
        "Alan: I will.",
        "Sebastian: Well, what do you say, boss? Time to hit the road?",

        "Marina: I mean, it's what everyone's been hoping for, for so long. I mean, I'm happy about it. At least the old michelle liked me, right? And it is about me.",

        "Danny: You are?",
        "Marina: Yes. Okay? I'm not worried about you and I. Michelle's not the only one who changed, danny. You did, too. You didn't just get over who she was after the accident, you got over who she was before.",

        "Danny: What?",
        "Marina: I'm not going to give up on what we have together. Not without a fight.",
        "Harley: Gus. Good. You need your rest. You've been working so hard. You've been working for me. And it was all for nothing. Look, it's too late for me, but you have a life and you need to get better so you can start living it. With someone else. It's time to stop living for me.",
