        "Coop: Ava. Hey, look, I'm really sorry about taking off after Lizzie called.",
        "Ava: No, that's not a problem. I'm sure there's an interesting story to go along with it, which I don't have time to hear.",
        "Coop: Do you have something fun lined up?",
        "Ava: I've got to go. Temp job. Temp job is exciting--",
        "Coop: Temp job? You just got finished working a double shift here.",
        "Ava: I quit my job at Outskirts; I need something to fill my time. Time flies when you serving fries, right?",
        "Buzz: She's a hard-working kid. She wants to take care of herself; I like that.",
        "Coop: Yeah, but if she's not careful, she's going to run herself into the ground, Pop.",
        "Buzz: We can't let that happen.",
        "Coop: No. You know what? We won't let that happen.",
        "Buzz: What are you thinking?",
        "Coop: You know what I-- you should hire her.",
        "Buzz: I thought I did hire her.",
        "Coop: Uh-uh, come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: My announcement. You kept it. This is all about me.",
        "Harley: Dinah, hi.",
        "Dinah: Hi. The stockholders memo will be out by tomorrow morning. I made a call.",
        "Harley: It's all taken care of.",
        "Dinah: What are you talking about. How is that possible? We don't even have the first draft.",
        "Harley: The new intern, she handled it. It's all taken care of-- at least for today. Don't worry.",
        "Dinah: Oh, okay. So what are you doing here?",
        "Harley: I came to see if there was some way I could help take care of you.",
        "Dinah: Really?",
        "Harley: I know what it is like to want someone there when you lose someone you really love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Gus: Well, I didn't realize it's a power walk race, dip.",
        "Mallet: Hopalong. You know what, maybe this isn't about your leg at all. Maybe you're just getting old.",
        "Gus: Ha-ha.",
        "Buzz: Officers of the law, grab a table there. What do you want?",
        "Gus: I'll have a glass of water straight up.",
        "Buzz: Big spenders, great. I'll be right back with that.",
        "Mallet: I still don't think you're getting the message. I think you need to take a couple more weeks before you sign back on the job.",
        "Gus: I spent plenty of time laying around, chained to a bed--",
        "Mallet: Gus...",
        "Gus: ... For months and months--",
        "Mallet: I can't hear it anymore. I've heard you're big survival tale of woe. My concern is I've got a limping partner with an ulcer that's close to exploding.",
        "Gus: You're lucky to have me.",
        "Mallet: Ladies and gentlemen, this is who's protecting my back.",
        "Gus: You're lucky. Look at the service here; it's terrible.",
        "Buzz: I'll get it. Sit down, I'll get it.",
        "Mallet: I'll get your water. It's like taking care of my grandmother. Don't worry about it, I...",

        "Mallet: Really? It's really good to have you back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jenn: To survive that class, you've got to zone out. The duller the lecture, the better the day dream. And I've had had some hot ones.",

        "Jonathan: Hey.",
        "Jenn: My car's really close?",

        "Tammy: Are you going to keep following me everywhere I go?",
        "Jonathan: Whatever works. I'm very focused; you know that. I got these for you. ( Laughing ) I saw them in front of an office building, but they reminded me of you, so... what, no dice? I thought after the other night--",
        "Tammy: That was a big mistake.",
        "Jonathan: A big mistake letting me kiss you? Now you know that wasn't a mistake. I know it, too. You miss me as much as I miss you?",
        "Tammy: You're not giving me a chance to miss you. I told you I need some space.",
        "Jonathan: You can't mean that.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, I do.",
        "Jonathan: What is this? What? A restraining order against me?",

        "Buzz: Yeah, about?",
        "Lizzie: Me. My feelings. I love him. I made a huge mistake.",
        "Buzz: You've got to let go. You've got to give this guy a break. I mean if it was meant to be--",
        "Lizzie: Do not give me that \"If you love him, let him go.\" I can't lose Coop, don't you get it? I keep losing people. I can't take it anymore. My dad, Uncle Ross...",
        "Buzz: Well I'm sorry about all that, but it doesn't mean you have to hang on to Coop.",
        "Lizzie: But he listens to me. He takes care of me. Just being around him... I swear-- it's turned me into such a better person. He has done so much for me.",
        "Buzz: Exactly. You should think about what you've done for him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: A restraining order. I got you flowers. I thought after the other night you were coming home. And you get me a restraining order.",
        "Tammy: I'm sorry. I just wish you would understand.",
        "Jonathan: You are the most important thing in my life, Tammy. Being with you is all I've got. And you're ripping it away from me with a piece of paper.",
        "Tammy: Please.",
        "Jonathan: Please what?! Please what?! You got one of these on Sandy. What is this? What is this, Tammy?",
        "Tammy: Protection.",
        "Jonathan: For who? For me?",
        "Tammy: No, from myself, Jonathan. Protection from myself. Okay. When I'm around you, oh, I have to just fight so hard. I've missed you so much. I miss the way you feel and the way you smell, and the way when I look in your eyes, I can see...",
        "Jonathan: What? You see what?",
        "Tammy: I can't breathe. I think about you all the time. I didn't get that restraining order because of you. I had to get it because of me. I can't help myself when I'm near you Jonathan. I can't stop wanting you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Hello? Springfield temps sent me over! I'm here! Candlelit table for one. I'm so sorry, but I don't do private parties. I have to go.",
        "Coop: Ava?",
        "Ava: Coop, what are you doing here?",
        "Coop: What do you think?",
        "Ava: About what?",

        "Coop: You had to serve dinner tonight, yeah, I know. I know. I wasn't the one that made the phone call. Pop's did, actually, but I was the one who set it up. Well, I'm your dignitary tonight.",
        "Ava: Well, and I'm lost.",
        "Coop: Um, Ava, this is all for you.",
        "Ava: What?",
        "Coop: This, the room, dinner. I hired you tonight because I wanted you to have the night off. I wanted you to sit and have a wonderful meal and be served; you know, have someone wait on you for a change.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: What did you think of the note?",
        "Mallet: What note?",
        "Gus: The note that Alan-Michael gave Harley that was supposed to be from me that said she should move on. I swear when I read that thing, I could've--",
        "Gus and mallet: ...Killed the sick bastard",
        "Gus: I could have killed the sick bastard.",
        "Mallet: ... The sick bastard.",
        "Gus: I could've--Killed the sick bastard! I got you. I think I got you. I think I was faster.",

        "Gus: Sure. As long as it wasn't with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: I thought maybe I'd hang on to a few things. I didn't think Blake would mind.",
        "Harley: Of course not. A... a hero. That's I always wanted to see him anyway. You're not listening to those rumors, are you, Dinah?",
        "Dinah: You mean with his assistant?",
        "Harley: They're not true.",
        "Dinah: Well, you never know. I mean people... people have their weaknesses, and you know they make mistakes. Everybody... everybody can surprise you, you know.",
        "Harley: Yeah, but sometimes in a good way. Sometimes people step up just when you need them most.",
        "Dinah: I guess.",
        "Harley: I know.",
        "Dinah: There are one or two questions I wouldn't mind having the answers to. I know you know what that's like.",

        "Harley: Sleep in.",
        "Dinah: And blow off the meeting? No, I think you need my help on that one.",
        "Harley: I can handle it. Sweetie, I know that you feel like you need to be there for me, you need to be there for the company, but I've got you covered. I hired someone to take your place.",
        "Ava: Is this a job or a date? It better not be a date, because I told you I don't want to do anything to get between you and Lizzie...",
        "Coop: Ava, please. Look, this is me just wanting to do something nice for you and that's all.",
        "Ava: Why?",
        "Coop: Why? Because I want to do something nice for you and you never let me, that's why.",
        "Ava: Give me that. Mmm. I'm such an ingrate. You know, I love these things. I just-- I'm not comfortable with this kind of situation. It's not normal for me. You know, these are so good. You've got to try one, Coop.",
        "Coop: I can tell. And you know what, it's more fun watching you.",
        "Ava: I don't know how to tell you thank you.",

        "Ava: No, no, no. Where are you going? Please don't go.",
        "Coop: What? There's five dvds on the tv over there; take your pick. I also got you that book you've been talking about after reading the reviews about it. Dinner time will be whatever time you want it to be. And, you know, I just overall want you to just enjoy yourself and just relax and just hang out and do whatever you want, Ava.",
        "Ava: Well I want you to stay.",
        "Coop: Are you sure?",
        "Ava: Well, I'm not sticking around for this \"not a date\" unless you are, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: What have I done for Coop? Buzz is right. What have I done for him? Is it too late? No. It can't be. Wait a minute. Room 404.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: All right. I'm out of here. Buy yourself something pretty.",
        "Gus: You in a big rush?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I'm going to go check on Dinah.",
        "Gus: Hey, let me ask you something. Was it rough on Dinah, you know you and Harley working together?",
        "Mallet: No, not really, why?",
        "Gus: Just wondering.",
        "Mallet: Mm-hmm.",

        "Gus: No, I've got my pogo stick.",
        "Mallet: Buy you a shopping cart?",
        "Gus: I'm good. What, what? What was that for?",
        "Buzz: Stop looking for trouble.",
        "Gus: I'm just a little curious what happened in this town after such a long time of my absence, wouldn't you be?",
        "Buzz: No.",
        "Gus: Oh, come on. Well, I wouldn't be either, Buzz, except Alan-Michael gave your daughter a note that was supposed to be for me telling her to move...",
        "Buzz: Will you let it go!",
        "Gus: You know something you're not telling me?",
        "Buzz: I know my daughter, your wife ached for you for every second that you were gone. I know her kids would have leapt over tall buildings when you showed up. You love her. You know that she loves you. Your job is to be happy; do it.",
        "Gus: So I shouldn't go there.",
        "Buzz: You should go home to your wife and kids.",
        "Gus: Yeah, because she loves me.",
        "Buzz: Yeah.",
        "Gus: That's all that matters.",
        "Buzz: That's all that matters. Go home! Get out of here.",

        "Dinah: You hired somebody else to take my place at work?",

        "Dinah: I've had plenty of time. I'm going to be back here in the morning.",
        "Harley: Dinah, your father just died.",
        "Dinah: And he would want me to be back at work!",
        "Harley: He would want me to help take care of you.",
        "Dinah: Take care of what, Harley?",
        "Harley: I mean just let the temp cover for you, so that you can take of things--",
        "Dinah: You know what, I handled a lot, Harley! I closed a lot of deals. I can be there!",
        "Harley: You're great at your job, but life comes first.",
        "Dinah: And this is my life?",
        "Harley: This is business. And your father died, and you need time, just like I needed time when Gus was gone.",
        "Dinah: Yes, that's right and Gus is back, and good for you. My father is not coming back. And I am not you. And I need to stay busy now. And you need to go and I need to stay there. And if you want to help me in any way, you can be there for your children, and you can comfort them because they need you. So you need to go, please.",
        "Harley: But if you need anything, I'm here for you, okay?",
        "Dinah: Okay.",
        "Harley: Because that's what friends are for. Take care of yourself, Dinah, okay? I'm calling you.",

        "Jonathan: Then what is it about?",
        "Tammy: What I need!",
        "Jonathan: What you need? You need me and I need you. Everything else is just junk people are putting in your head. Come on, come on. Screw the restraining order. Just come home with me.",
        "Tammy: No. Aren't you listening to me? Didn't you hear one word I said?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I heard you say you miss me. I heard you say you think about me all of the time.",
        "Tammy: I want to stop.",
        "Jonathan: You can't stop. You can't stop yourself. And this piece of paper can't stop you. You can stack a million of them a mile high. Who cares? Nothing the court can say is going to keep me from you. Paper can't stop me.",

        "Mallet: Well, why don't you let Blake do that?",
        "Dinah: Blake. Yeah, well, she can get the memories, she can go after the old job, but, you know, I guess everybody has something, right?",
        "Mallet: What's going on?",
        "Dinah: I'll tell you what's going on. Harley relieved me of my duties.",
        "Mallet: What?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, she waltzed in here today, acting all sympathetic, and said, \"Sweetie, do you need any more time to grieve? Do you need to take some time off, sweetie?\" As if I don't know how to handle this after everything I've been through in my life.",
        "Mallet: Dinah, I think what she's saying...",
        "Dinah: \"Sweetie, if you look at the hurt too long, you won't heal.\"",
        "Mallet: None of that sounds like you're fired to me.",
        "Dinah: Well, it's pretty darn close. A couple of days ago, I was running this company. I was running it; I was the CEO. But now she's bringing in all these temps, just to... I don't know, look for my replacements, I don't know. But I made a difference, I know that, I made a big difference, but now I'm doing nothing.",
        "Mallet: That's not true.",
        "Dinah: Maybe not to you.",
        "Mallet: Definitely not to me. People know you're something, you understand that? People see something.",
        "Dinah: My dad saw something.",
        "Mallet: Yes, he sure did.",
        "Dinah: We didn't have enough time ever to talk about it. And just... it's too late now. I found an article, and it's when I got my announcement for the CEO chair. He had it behind his frame. It was just awesome. You know, it was all about me. ( Laughs )",
        "Mallet: He cut this out and he kept it.",
        "Dinah: Yeah.",
        "Mallet: Good for him. He was proud of you.",
        "Dinah: Yeah. I miss him so much.",
        "Mallet: He was proud of a lot more than just a job. He was proud of the woman you became. He was proud of the funny, lovely, smart, beautiful, strong woman you are, the woman you've always been.",
        "Dinah: I miss him so much.",
        "Mallet: Look, maybe you should take some time off from Spaulding, you know? Give yourself a break.",
        "Dinah: Why? Why? Because Harley said so?",
        "Mallet: You know, I know you're hurting a lot, and I know you wish some things. But that's wishing. You know what the reality is? Harley is my ex, she's your boss, she's our friend. The reality is that's all she is. That's it. I want to move on. Do you want to move on with me? Can we move on?",
        "Dinah: Yes. And we will get through this one way or another, we will, but this is not about Harley. This is about... you know, I felt needed. I felt respected.",
        "Mallet: Then talk to Harley and tell her that.",
        "Dinah: What am I going to tell her, that I want her job? Is that what I'm going to say? That doesn't make any sense. I mean, my gosh, I mean, every time I find something solid in my life, it is like the rug is being pulled right out from underneath me. You know, my brother, he is in Venezuela; my mother, she comes in and out of town, which is fantastic. She puts her arms around me, but I don't even have enough time at the end of day to have a real conversation with her. And I don't know, I want to belong somewhere, Mallet. I mean, don't you think that that's fair to ask?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I think, um... I think you ought to come with me.",
        "Dinah: Now? Where? What?",
        "Mallet: I think you ought to come with me because I want to show you something. Come on, trust me, all right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zach: Just like Christmas!",
        "Gus: Are you kidding me? This is the best holiday of the year. And do you know what it's called? Does anybody remember what its called?",
        "Harley: Uh-uh.",
        "Gus: It's called normal day. Normal day, yeah!",
        "Zach: There's no such thing called normal day.",
        "Gus: You said that before, but that's not true, there is normal day. There are thousands of normal days being celebrated all over the world. Now, let me tell you how it works. Normal day: Mommy wakes up, she goes to work, I go to work, you guys go to school, and then when you're finished with school and I'm finished with work, we all come back and we meet at the house.",
        "Harley: Our house.",
        "Gus: We meet at the house. Oh, yeah, there's another thing. Two days a week, we don't have to do anything. You guys don't go to school, we don't go to work, and we sit around the house all day, and we do nothing. We eat whatever we want and we sleep in. How does that sound?",
        "Harley: Yay! It sounds perfect. I want to do normal day, day after day after day.",
        "Gus: I like normal day.",
        "Harley: Uh-huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I knew that there was something going on in here, but this, you...",
        "Coop: All right, all right. Lizzie, what are you doing here, and how did you even find me?",
        "Lizzie: What does it matter how? I'm here because I love you, Coop. And I know that I messed up when I lied about Joey. I came here to tell you how sorry I was, and I know that we would have a chance if it wasn't for her. She keeps showing up everywhere.",
        "Ava: I keep showing up everywhere? Lizzie, you're showing up here. You're not even invited.",
        "Lizzie: You swore that you weren't together.",
        "Coop: We aren't, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: How long? Are you sleeping together, too?",
        "Coop: Jeez, Lizzie, I've tried to tell you this, okay? Ava and I are not together.",
        "Lizzie: You expect me to believe that? Do you really?",
        "Ava: You know what? You can believe what you want. Believe what you want, I don't care. You know what? He came here, he didn't even do anything. You know what? Screw it. Screw it! Does that answer your question, huh? I care about you, okay? I care about you. And I am so sick of watching you play him the way you've been playing him. You know what? This wasn't a date for your information, but it is now.",
        "Coop: Ava, uh...",
        "Ava: You... go ahead, run after her. You can get her if you want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: What do you want me to do, Tammy? I can make him go away.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy, come on. Tell him what you really want.",
        "Tammy: Help me, please.",
        "Frank: That's all I needed to hear.",
        "Jonathan: Get your hands off me! Tammy!",
        "Frank: You're finished. You're done.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy, come on!",
        "Frank: Get away from her.",
        "Jonathan: Look, you did this! You knew who I was when you chose me! You chose me!",
        "Tammy: Don't hurt him, please.",
        "Jonathan: We made promises to each other and I didn't break them! You did!",
        "Tammy: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.",
        "Jonathan: Let go of me. Tammy, wait!",
        "Frank: Stand back!",
        "Jonathan: Tammy, wait! Tammy!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: You brought me back to our room. Why?",
        "Mallet: You said you needed someplace solid, a place where you felt like you were needed.",
        "Dinah: So you brought me here?",
        "Mallet: Yeah. It's home.",
        "Dinah: Look, Mallet, that's awfully sweet. I thank you so much, but I've got real big problems right now.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I know. Me, too. You just told me your whole life is about your job, and that can be kind of depressing. But that's okay. I'm here, and we're going to work on that. Okay? You lost a lot.",
        "Dinah: I lost my father. And my family. But, I'll tell you, we've got this room, and the world is our oyster, baby. Right? This good, old hotel room.",
        "Mallet: Hey. Forget the room. The room's not home. Hey, look at me. I'm home. I need you. And I see you, and I know how good you are. And I know how smart you are. And I know I messed up. ( Dinah sniffs ) But I can't let what I did mess this up. I don't have any family here either. And in regards to my job, I love my job, but it's not all I got. You're the thing I got. I won't leave. I will stay as long as you let me. You've got a permanent place right here, right here in the center of my life, our life. Okay? I love you.",
        "Dinah: You love me?",
        "Mallet: Yeah. And when you need something to count on, then count on that.",
        "Dinah: ( Sighs ) Oh, I've got you. I know I've got you.",

        "Harley: Hurry up, hurry up.",
        "Gus: Keep moving here. We'll take our food with us.",
        "Harley: And then I want them in.",
        "Gus: Fine, fine, fine.",
        "Jude: I feel raindrops.",
        "Harley: Oh, gosh, okay, then everybody in. We'll make room, we'll make room. Don't you worry about it. You guys get in.",

        "Harley: Oh, Daddy, I love you.",
        "Gus: I love you, too.",
        "Harley: Come on out and everybody put on a raincoat please.",
        "Gus: I love you, but that's not going to fit me.",
        "Harley: Come here, baby. Oh, gosh. You know what, forget the raincoats, forget the umbrellas. Everybody in!",
        "Gus: Come on, everybody squeeze together. Come on, let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Ah, Coop, I'm really sorry. I hope I didn't freak you out with the whole grabbing you. I hope I didn't hurt you trying to kiss you.",
        "Coop: No, you didn't. As a matter of fact, I wanted to apologize to you for that whole Lizzie thing and scaring off the waiter. Believe me, this is not how I wanted the whole evening to go, with you cleaning up.",
        "Ava: Well, to be honest, with you not talking, since I haven't heard a peep out of you in 15 minutes.",
        "Coop: Well, I guess I didn't know what to say to you. I didn't know if you wanted to talk about the... maybe not, I don't know.",
        "Ava: Do you?",
        "Coop: Do I? Want to talk about the...?",
        "Ava: Yeah.",
        "Coop: No. No, not really. Um, I guess, honestly, I guess I would rather do it again, though, sometime, maybe. You know. Look, its been on my mind. I'm not going to lie to you. It's been on my mind since it happened, and I'm really kind of hoping that you feel the same way?",
        "Ava: I've been thinking about it a little more than I would like to admit right now, I suppose.",
        "Coop: Fair enough. You know what, I will take that. I will take that. Do you mind if I maybe...",
        "Ava: Do what?",
        "Coop: Yes?",
        "Ava: Yeah, sure.",
        "Coop: Okay. Great. Well, so far so good, huh, Cinderella?",
        "Ava: ( Laughs )",
        "Coop: Look, I'm just wishing your coach didn't turn back into a pumpkin so early. I was really, really hoping tonight was going to go as planned, but unfortunately it didn't.",
        "Ava: I'm kind of glad that it didn't, really.",
