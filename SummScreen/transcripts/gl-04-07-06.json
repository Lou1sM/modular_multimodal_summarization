        "Marina finds Tammy and asks her how she is doing after having Jonathan thrown in jail. Tammy, who didn't realize that Frank put Jonathan in jail, wants to go after him but Marina tells her that she made the right choice. Lizzie bails Jonathan out of jail and the two of them get drunk. They see Marina and Tammy and although Jonathan wants to talk to Tammy, Lizzie tells him it wouldn't be a good idea. They run into Coop and Ava and after a few heated words Jonathan decks Coop. Coop gets in a few punches himself and Lizzie takes Jonathan back to her apartment to clean up. While Remy asks Tammy out on a date and she turns him down saying that she isn't ready to move on, Lizzie and Jonathan start passionately kissing and ripping each other's clothes off. Alan lets Alan-Michael know that he knows about his and Ross's secret meetings and wonders what Marina would think if she knew that A-M had anything to do with Ross's death. Alan later tells Alan-Michael that he plans on taking back over as CEO of Spaulding. Alan-Michael storms out and Alan follows. When Alan berates Alan-Michael, Marina overhears and sticks up for Alan-Michael. Frank tells Buzz that he has two tickets for the policeman's ball for he and Olivia. He starts to wonder how Buzz knows Olivia so well and when Frank says that he wants to take Olivia back to the cabin where they all spent the night together, Buzz decides he can't take it anymore. He goes to Olivia's to tell her that he can't lie to Frank anymore, but Frank overhears them. He lays into Buzz and tells him to find someone else to rent the room at Company because he is moving out. Buzz tells Olivia how he feels about her and has since Bill left and when Olivia asks why he didn't tell her before, Buzz asks if it would have made a difference. When Olivia says probably not, Buzz leaves and Olivia is left alone."

        "Ira: So any big changes in your tax return this year?",
        "Harley: You don't read the newspaper much, do you?",
        "Ira: Not much.",
        "Harley: Okay, well, I started out the year making 50 cents a day because I was in prison, and I ended the year married-- which is good, right?-- Making six figures as a CEO.",
        "Ira: Oh, all right. Gus?",
        "Gus: Nope, everything's easy for me. Although next year might be a problem because I was legally dead, partially, briefly. Do I get a tax break for that?",
        "Ira: I'll have to look that one up.",
        "Harley: Anyway, I don't think these um-- honey-- these receipts really tell the story of what kind of a year we also have. I don't think they also tell you how good it feels to be normal again.",
        "Gus: Save all of these, though, you know.",
        "Harley: You okay?",
        "Gus: What are we talking about?",
        "Ira: Prison salary. You had quite a year.",
        "Harley: Yes. I hope to you never have a year like that ever again.",
        "Ira: Look at it this way, now you can handle anything life throws you.",
        "Harley: Somehow it doesn't make me feel better. Can we just go back to tax talk? There is stuff everywhere, sweetie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Hey, I know you're upset, and that's understandable.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Hey little brother.",
        "Coop: Hey.",
        "Frank: Have you seen Harley?",
        "Coop: No. It's not my day to watch her.",
        "Frank: That's a good thing because you're too busy watching Ava.",
        "Coop: Okay.",
        "Frank: Get over here. What are you doing here? Get in there and sweep her off her feet.",
        "Coop: \"Sweep her off her feet.\" Is that something you would say, Frank?",
        "Frank: Listen, if you don't like her, yeah, I'd love to sweep her off of her feet.",
        "Coop: Okay. All right, all right.",
        "Frank: But you know what? Taking another man's woman is not exactly my style.",
        "Coop: Wow. Is there something we need to talk about?",
        "Frank: No. I just need to talk to Harley, is what I need to do. And being that she's not here, I'm out of here. Now, Henry, go in there and get the girl.",
        "Coop: Okay. Thank you, thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Now what did that poor rug ever do to you, unless of course you're pretending that it's somebody else. Maybe-- I don't know-- Jeffrey.",
        "Cassie: How about you and Reva for being such idiots yesterday. I can't even believe you went through with that divorce.",
        "Josh: Yes, we did. But then later on we changed our minds and we tore up the paperwork!",
        "Cassie: You did?",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: Really?",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: Josh, that is great news!",
        "Josh: I'm still your brother- in-law.",
        "Cassie: I'm so happy for you. Did I tell you or did I tell you?",
        "Josh: You told me.",
        "Cassie: Where's Reva? We've got to celebrate.",
        "Josh: Actually, she went to Paris to be with Marah. That's a good thing, though. She didn't want to disappoint her, change her plans, you know. And she wanted to give her the good news. But Reva can't wait to get back and I can't wait to have her back. So, you're going to have to find somebody else to beat the crap out of. Maybe Jonathan.",
        "Cassie: No. I'm turning over a new leaf. I told Tammy that I'm going to keep my opinions to myself and I'm going to let her make her own decisions, right or wrong. And I am really going to try to stick to that.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Tammy: Mom? Hi, Uncle Josh.",
        "Josh: Hey, Tammy.",
        "Cassie: Hi, honey. I'm so glad to see you.",
        "Tammy: Oh. I'm going to hang on to that for a second, because you might not feel that way after I ask you this question.",
        "Cassie: Why, what are you going to ask me?",
        "Tammy: Um... did you really mean what you said about supporting me and Jonathan?",
        "Cassie: Support?",
        "Tammy: How about tolerate?",
        "Cassie: Better.",
        "Tammy: Good, because I'm about to put you to the test. Isn't it fun being a mom?",
        "Tammy: Uh-huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I will take one of those and a tequila chaser, please.",
        "Jonathan: How about a soda?",
        "Lizzie: What's with this chaperone thing?",
        "Jonathan: I just don't need you getting sloppy drunk around here.",
        "Lizzie: Why, are you afraid you won't able to control yourself?",
        "Jonathan: What? I told you not to come back here.",
        "Lizzie: What are you so worried about?",
        "Jonathan: You left this in my bed, Lizzie. Tammy found it, okay?",
        "Lizzie: All right. What was I supposed to say? Wait a minute, what was Tammy doing in your bed?",
        "Jonathan: Come on.",
        "Lizzie: No.",
        "Jonathan: Goodbye.",
        "Lizzie: Please tell me you didn't taker back? What about making her beg? What about the restraining order she had against you.",
        "Jonathan: We settled out of court. Everything's fine now. Everything is under control.",
        "Lizzie: Everything except for me.",
        "Harley: What are you doing?",
        "Gus: This is stale. The place is going downhill.",
        "Harley: Uh-huh.",
        "Gus: I just needed to stretch my leg. Where did Ira go?",
        "Harley: I told him that we were going to file an extension if that's okay.",
        "Gus: \"Ira.\"",
        "Harley: Ira, our accountant.",
        "Gus: I'm okay with an extension.",
        "Harley: Good. I didn't think we should rush into doing our taxes, if we really didn't have to, especially since you're not feeling so hot.",
        "Gus: No. I feel good.",
        "Harley: Feel good? Is that why you're still popping these?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: I want you to be honest with me, okay? Am I widely insecure to be ticked off at this entire thing?",
        "Mallet: Well, let's see. Well, we've got a whole article here, and it's mostly about your father's legacy, and about Blake's run for mayor. And it finishes up with everything about-- talks about the kids. So you have a whole article and it's not even about you and you're not even mentioned. So, yeah, I would be a little annoyed.",
        "Dinah: Are you kidding me? I wasn't even talking about this article. I was talking about this one on page six. This is unbelievable! No matter what I do, I'm invisible, an after-thought.",
        "Mallet: Well, you make my front page headline.",
        "Dinah: I think that I'm going nuts. I'm at the headline, but what about the other night. The other night when you said \"extra, extra,\" you now. \"Mallet and his ex-wife, they do it.\"",
        "Mallet: That was history. All right. Very much history. Not a headline.",
        "Dinah: You're going to tell me that your ego doesn't love having two women who want you.",
        "Mallet: Well there's one woman I don't want, and there is one that is more than I can handle.",
        "Dinah: Yes, you're right, detective. I am more than you can handle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Hey, what are you doing? Stop!",
        "Coop: If you want to-- It's quitting time.",
        "Ava: I don't know who's watch you're looking at, but I'm still working.",
        "Coop: Well, I said so because I'm the boss's son. Come on, let's go out and celebrate. What do you say?",
        "Ava: Celebrate what?",
        "Coop: Whatever. Do we need a reason to celebrate?",
        "Ava: If I'm going to be losing tips, yeah.",
        "Coop: Fine, fine. Let's go out and celebrate that I did an amazing job of plastering the wall between our rooms, how about that? You like that, don't you?",
        "Ava: Yeah, you mean the whole you punched through the wall? Yeah. I'm still not convinced you didn't do that on purpose.",
        "Coop: Well, I guess that would just make the me the world's biggest Peeping Tom now, wouldn't it?",
        "Ava: You want to be the best?",
        "Coop: Oh. That is a good point. Anyways, look. You, my dear, look pretty ravishing in the whole little facial mask thing you had going on.",
        "Ava: Oh, shut-- shut up! Stop it.",
        "Coop: It was a good look for you; I liked it. Come on, let's just go out-- hey, it was a good look for you. Let's just have some fun. Come on, lighten up a little bit. We had fun fixing the wall, didn't we? Yes?",
        "Ava: Yes. We had a lot of fun. We did. You know, speaking of walls, there is something to be said for walls. You can't get hurt through walls. And you can't get heartbroken when a certain guy goes back to a certain girl again.",
        "Coop: Ava, please. Come here, look at me. That's not going to happen, all right? Lizzie and I are done.",
        "Ava: Can I have your solemn vow on that?",
        "Coop: My solemn vow?",
        "Ava: Yes.",
        "Coop: Yes, you can. And I will cross my heart with it, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Why do I get the feeling you can't let go of the one night we spent together.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, please.",
        "Jonathan: You're here all of the time; you're lonely.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, don't flatter yourself. I'm fine.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, you look fine.",
        "Lizzie: I just think it's a little hilarious and a little pathetic that all of a sudden you and Tammy think you can just work it out. Did you wake up a new respectable human being? Ooh, wait, wait. Now, Tammy has a mom who doesn't hate you.",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) Yeah, you're just pissy because I'm back with Tammy and Coop won't take you back.",
        "Lizzie: He will soon. I stole Ava's room key from Buzz. I'm going to break in and look around--",
        "Jonathan: Bad idea.",
        "Lizzie: How can you say that?",
        "Jonathan: Because I know! Digging up dirt on Ava's the worst thing you can do.",
        "Lizzie: Well, listen to you, the relationship expert.",
        "Jonathan: No. But I'm doing a lot better than you are. Look, if you want to get Coop back, the way to get him back is not to get rid of Ava. The way to get him back is to get rid of Coop.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You want me to invite Jonathan to dinner?",
        "Tammy: Close your mouth. Flies. It's no big deal. It can just be a normal family dinner. We sit around, we talk, we eat, we laugh. Eat some more and talk. No fights, no fires, and no physical violence of any kind.",
        "Cassie: Well, you know, that sounds refreshing, when do you want to do this?",
        "Tammy: Tonight?",
        "Josh: ( Laughs )",
        "Tammy: What, why not?",
        "Josh: Tammy, sometimes people like a little thing called notice.",
        "Tammy: Why, so she can agonize over it and turn it into some huge deal which it doesn't need to be? You said you would respect my decision to be with Jonathan, Mom.",
        "Cassie: I did.",
        "Tammy: You said you'd try.",
        "Cassie: And I will, I will. And what better way than to plunge right in with a home-cooked meal. So, is Jonathan allergic to anything? I mean, other than me?",
        "Tammy: Thank you. Thank you. Oh, you're the best.",
        "Josh: I just want to say that I think the two of you handled this very nicely. I'll see you; have fun tonight.",
        "Cassie: No, no, no. I need reinforcements, and you've got to eat dinner.",
        "Josh: That's a bad idea, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: I think you're a coward.",
        "Josh: I'm not a coward; I just think I would hurt more than I would help, and Jonathan doesn't like me a whole lot these days.",
        "Tammy: No, that is not true, Uncle Josh. Jonathan likes you.",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Tammy: Okay, okay. Well, he respects you. Which is better. Mom's right, you should be here. Besides, it would help to have another guy, and you're a guy.",
        "Josh: I appreciate you pointing that out.",
        "Tammy: Don't make me beg.",
        "Josh: Okay, all right, I guess I can spare the evening.",
        "Cassie: Then we're set. I'll just see what's in the freezer, get cooking. What time is Jonathan coming over?",
        "Tammy: I don't know, I haven't asked him yet.",
        "Cassie: This is going to be super.",
        "Josh: ( Laughs )",
        "Cassie: Fun, fun, fun.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Get rid of Coop? Are you nuts? That is the last thing I would want to do.",
        "Jonathan: You're not listening.",
        "Lizzie: Because you're not making any sense. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Jonathan: Hello.",
        "Tammy: Hey. What are you doing right now?",
        "Jonathan: Nothing much. Why?",
        "Tammy: Because I have an offer that you cannot refuse.",
        "Jonathan: Dinner tonight? With your mom and Joshua, what are you looking for bloodshed?",
        "Lizzie: ( Laughs )",
        "Tammy: Jonathan, where are you?",
        "Jonathan: I'm at Outskirts. There are some really obnoxious people here. Your mom wanting me to come over is not the same as playing musical chairs.",
        "Tammy: Well, I didn't think that would be part of it. It's just dinner, and she's into it. So how about you?",
        "Jonathan: I don't know. The last family event I went to turned into wrestle mania 20.",
        "Tammy: Not this time. This is different. This is the start of us being normal again.",
        "Jonathan: Normal?",
        "Lizzie: Ooh, can I come?",
        "Jonathan: Look, if it's that important to you, okay. But let's get one thing straight: I am done auditioning to your family. If anything, they have something to prove to me now.",
        "Tammy: Well, me, too.",
        "Jonathan: Maybe.",
        "Tammy: Well, how can I prove myself if you're not here?",
        "Jonathan: What time?",
        "Tammy: Five, or whenever you can make it.",
        "Jonathan: Should I bring brownies?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, dinner with the family, it's so sweet.",
        "Jonathan: Well, me and Tammy are going to try to be more normal. It's going to help us really stick.",
        "Lizzie: Well, Coop and I are going to stick, too.",
        "Jonathan: Uh-huh. Only if you take my advice and get him the hell out of dodge.",
        "Lizzie: Dodge? What are you talking about?",
        "Jonathan: You know what, forget it?",
        "Lizzie: Forget what?",
        "Jonathan: You're smart. You figure it out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Wow, I guess the walls are back up, aren't they? All plastered and painted, huh?",
        "Ava: No. It's just that you and Lizzie just broke up. I just want to take things slow, that's all.",
        "Coop: Well, um, if that's the case, well, maybe we should just cancel the plans for tonight and you should just put this back on. No, I'm just kidding. Ava, stop, please, come on. Look, I'm trying here, okay? I just want to spend time with you. Is that so wrong? Just you and me, please.",
        "Ava: Why?",
        "Coop: You really don't know?",
        "Ava: No. Tell me.",
        "Coop: Okay. All right, fine, you want to hear it? Here it is: Because you're fine and you're funny, and you're witty and you're smart.",
        "Ava: And cute.",
        "Coop: Yes, I was getting to there. You're cute, too. And every time--",
        "Ava: Sometimes.",
        "Coop: No, all the time. Every time I'm with you, I want to tell you everything, but like now, I can't even get a complete sentence out. And, um, your nose, you've got a cute little nose. I like that, too. And... ( cell phone rings) Come on. Oh, um, hello. Yeah, this is Henry Cooper Bradshaw. Oxford. Um, yeah, yeah, right. The writing fellowship. That was last year. Unfortunately I had to turn it down. Again? No, ah-- are you serious? Another shot at Oxford?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: I don't know how those got there.",
        "Harley: I saw you take one.",
        "Gus: I just had one. Because my leg, the weather-- you know. Listen, all I need is an aspirin, honestly, and I don't have an aspirin. It's no big deal.",
        "Harley: Then why lie to me about it?",
        "Gus: Did I? I just didn't want you to worry about it, that's all. I know you're such a worry wart.",
        "Harley: Honey, if you're leg hurts, go to a doctor. Talk to the doctor about what's wrong with your leg. They can make it better, but don't start messing with these things.",
        "Gus: All right, listen. You take those, you can have those, okay. You take them, do-- flush them down the toilet because all I need is aspirin. If I can just have an aspirin, I'll just take an aspirin. I'll be happy with that. That's all I need.",
        "Harley: Just talk to Rick, he is a good guy. Just talk to him.",
        "Gus: Rick, okay.",
        "Harley: Because you don't want to talk to me.",
        "Gus: I am. That's cool. I'm good with that.",
        "Harley: Hey! There you are, my right arm, I would be lost without you, sweetie.",
        "Dinah: Oh.",
        "Mallet: Good?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Well, look at you, I thought this was supposed to be a normal, casual, everyday dinner.",
        "Tammy: I could still look good, can't I? ( Knock on the door ) Hey, I'm so glad you're here.",
        "Jonathan: You're all dressed up.",
        "Josh: Hello, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Joshua, Cassie. Here, these are for you.",
        "Cassie: Almost a six-pack.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I pounded one on the way over.",
        "Cassie: That's really thoughtful, thank you. This is perfect. Actually, it will go with what we're having. Chili, I hope you like chili.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, sure.",
        "Cassie: Good. Then why don't we go into the living room. And Tammy, will you help me with the chips and salsa.",
        "Tammy: Yeah. This is good, right?",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, yeah.",

        "Marcy Rylan, \"Inside The Light.\" I get very nervous for interviews, I have to warn you guys. I am really excited about playing Lizzie, which is really fun. I grew up in central Pennsylvania, country girl. Where I grew up, people don't become actors. It's not in the list of things, a high school moment. I thought I could do this for the rest of my life. And I did. See Lizzie, Wednesday, April 19th, \"Inside The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: This guy comes into Outskirts and is going to get us a ticket to the concert.",
        "Cassie: That's great.",
        "Tammy: He's doing Jonathan a favor because he helped him when his car broke down.",
        "Cassie: That's great.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, a friend to every drunk in town, including your brother. Not that I think he is drinking now, to my knowledge, but Billy's all right. You know, I think he has made a lot of mistakes of his own, and that's why he doesn't judge people.",
        "Cassie: Do you enjoy owning a bar? I know it was kind of forced on you.",
        "Tammy: He's great at it.",
        "Cassie: But is it something you want to do long-term? Or are there other things you want to do?",
        "Jonathan: No. I never thought I would ever be this settled down.",

        "Jonathan: No. I mean, owning something and being responsible, that was never my thing.",
        "Josh: Really, you?",
        "Cassie: Some people take longer to find themselves.",
        "Josh: I can certainly relate to that. I was one of those people.",
        "Cassie: Oh, come on. I'm sure you always knew where were you headed and had your feet planted firmly on the ground.",
        "Josh: No, that's not true. I did a lot of things growing up and made a lot of people angry at me, including my father.",
        "Cassie: Really?",
        "Josh: Mm-hmm.",
        "Cassie: I never knew that about you?",
        "Jonathan: You always had his millions to fall back on if you screwed up.",
        "Josh: That was a blessing and a curse. Everything comes with a price, including money.",
        "Cassie: That's right, everything does. I think we all make our mistakes. I think we all have to pay our dues one way or another. The important thing is that ultimately you come to a place where you're happy. I'm grateful tonight that we're all feeling pretty happy, right?",
        "Tammy: Right.",
        "Cassie: And we have what matters most right here. We have family, and we have love. What did I say?",
        "Josh: Nothing, Cassie. You couldn't have been nicer.",

        "Coop: They said they received an anonymous grant, which means that this year there's going to be another writing fellowship.",
        "Ava: And you got it?",
        "Coop: No, I didn't get it, but they said if I would reapply, that they would put me on the short list for it.",
        "Ava: Well, you almost had it last year. Coop, that's so awesome!",
        "Coop: I've got to think about this, Ava.",
        "Ava: Think about what? Are you kidding me? I know how much you wanted this. You left it behind because of Lizzie. Come on, we really have something to celebrate. Let's go.",
        "Coop: That's true.",
        "Lizzie: Can I celebrate, too?",
        "Ava: Lizzie, how did you know about Oxford?",
        "Lizzie: Oxford? I was talking about Coop's birthday. What are you guys talking about?",
        "Ava: It's your birthday today?",
        "Lizzie: Tomorrow.",
        "Ava: Why didn't you tell me?",
        "Lizzie: Henry hates to make a big deal about his birthday.",
        "Coop: Well, that depends. Sometimes I am really up for celebrating.",
        "Lizzie: Is that what you guys are going to do tomorrow night?",
        "Coop: Or tonight. Whatever you want.",
        "Lizzie: Wow, you must really be a good influence on him, Ava. Maybe you can get him to accept this small gift.",
        "Coop: Lizzie--",
        "Lizzie: No, wait. It is nothing fancy. It's just something that I saw that I thought you would like. We're friends now. Friends remember each other's birthdays.",
        "Ava: Open it.",
        "Coop: Oh.",
        "Lizzie: You're always jotting down ideas for stories, so I thought--",
        "Coop: Lizzie, this is beautiful. This is... this is... thank you.",
        "Ava: You can take it to Oxford.",
        "Coop: If I go.",
        "Ava: When you go.",
        "Lizzie: Oxford again, what are you guys talking about?",
        "Ava: He just got a call from Oxford saying they have another writing fellowship, and Coop is going to get it.",
        "Coop: That's a little optimistic--",
        "Lizzie: Really? That's great. I'm so happy for you.",
        "Coop: It is not definite, and there are tests I have to take and writings and samples.",
        "Lizzie: Please. They gave it to you before, and they're going to give it to him again.",
        "Ava: Exactly.",
        "Lizzie: You are so sweet to be so supportive.",
        "Ava: Why wouldn't I be?",
        "Lizzie: I don't know, I guess if I was still his girlfriend, I'd probably be worried that he'd go off and follow up with one of those classy, brilliant Oxford girls and never come home. But clearly you must be more secure than I am.",
        "Ava: Clearly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Thank you. So tell me about last night. Any problems?",
        "Dinah: No problems. None.",
        "Harley: Good. Because the people are raving what a great party it was, the coverage by the press is amazing, and we raised tons of money...",
        "Dinah: We did a good job. All of us did.",
        "Harley: Yeah. And I'm sorry I didn't give you a heads-up about the speech. That was really a last-minute decision because I felt like I wasn't going to be there, but I should be there in some small way to show people that I'm in charge, that somebody is in charge. Especially with Alan-Michael.",
        "Dinah: Well, you know what, people know that you're in charge. They do, especially now.",
        "Harley: You mad at me?",
        "Dinah: About what?",
        "Harley: Okay. This is me promising you for the record that the next time there's some big event at Spaulding, come hell or high water, I will be there.",
        "Dinah: Well, good. That's what I wanted to hear. So, Gus, he looks a little stronger. The pills aren't an issue anymore?",
        "Harley: No. We talked. He's going cold turkey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Stop.",
        "Mallet: Hey. I've got to go. I'll call you. Bye, everybody.",
        "Gus: See ya.",
        "Dinah: You know, I think I'm going to go ahead and go to my appointment.",
        "Mallet: What, I thought we were hanging out?",
        "Dinah: Honey, I'm sorry, I didn't tell you. I will be back a little later. All right?",
        "Mallet: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: It's not right, is it? Okay, so you don't like this, not yet. I just wanted to prove that I love you, that I can have you and I can have my family, too.",
        "Jonathan: It's just weird.",
        "Tammy: And you're not ready to trust that. I can't say I blame you. You think I'm pushing.",
        "Jonathan: No, it wasn't that.",
        "Tammy: What?",
        "Jonathan: No, it wasn't that, whatever, dinner, being with your mom, she was like really talking to me, and she would look me in the eyes. I don't know. I know we took a few shots at each other, but it felt kind of harmless. I guess, like when a real family takes shots at each other. I don't know.",
        "Tammy: So you liked it?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I mean... I mean not to do every night, but sometimes, yeah.",
        "Tammy: So why did you come out here?",
        "Jonathan: I don't know. I'm kind of freaked out. But I had an okay time.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan. Thank you. Hmmm, thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: This fellowship is not a done deal. And even if I were to get it, I wouldn't go over until the summer.",
        "Lizzie: Please, those are details. The point is, Coop, your dream is going to come true.",
        "Coop: Well, at least part of it. Is your passport ready?",
        "Ava: Is my-- mine? Yeah, why.",
        "Coop: Because you're going to need it if you're going to come with me.",
        "Ava: Come with you...",
        "Coop: To Oxford. Ava, listen, okay? You can get a waitress job over there just as easily as here, right?",
        "Ava: Yeah.",
        "Coop: And you can take classes, too. So when we're not taking classes and when you're not taking classes or working, we can travel. We can go to see Bath. We can go to Brighton. We could even go to London. And if my brother's around, we can even see him, too. Plus the easiest thing is... Paris is just so close, right next door.",
        "Ava: Paris?",
        "Coop: Yes. What do you think?",
        "Lizzie: Coop, hi, wait.",
        "Ava: What do I think?",
        "Lizzie: That might not be workable. Ava needs to get a visa.",
        "Coop: That's not a problem. I mean, we have plenty of time between now and then, but the only question is: Are you interested?",
        "Ava: Am I interested? Are you kidding me? Oh, my gosh, Paris! Yes, of course.",
        "Coop: That's answer enough. Okay, you know what? Let me just tell you, if I can find the guy who gave this anonymous grant, I don't know what I would do. I would probably give him a kiss or something like that at this point.",
        "Ava: Okay.",
        "Coop: Come on, I'll tell you what. Come here, I've got something to show you.",
        "Ava: Okay. Oh, my God.",
        "Lizzie: Her-- he'd give her a kiss.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Didn't we have a couple of dates. What happened?",
        "Harley: Life happened. Commitments, obligations, taxes. All that mundane stuff that seems great to me now that my husband is back.",
        "Mallet: Good, so, you're happy?",
        "Harley: I'm very happy. You happy?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I'm doing okay. Life's great.",
        "Frank: Oh, good, good. I'm glad I found you, sis.",
        "Harley: Are you okay?",
        "Frank: Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just checking in. Mallet: Come on, what are you drinking? I'm buying, let's go. You don't need to do that, I'm buying. I'll be right back.",
        "Mallet: What is up with him? Is he all right?",
        "Harley: Yeah, I guess. When he's checking in. It means he wants to talk.",
        "Mallet: Really? Maybe I should leave.",
        "Harley: No. If things get ugly, I'll give you a big kick under this table.",
        "Mallet: Good idea; that's a good plan.",
        "Harley: What's up with Dinah? She seemed a little tense.",
        "Mallet: She is dealing with a lot, her dad's death and shifting her job responsibilities again. She's okay. She'll be fine.",
        "Harley: Of course she'll be fine. She has you to lean on, and I have Gus, and everything is good. Everything is good. I'm really happy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Thank you very much.",
        "Dinah: Gus.",
        "Gus: Hey, how's it going? Are you following me? I think you are.",
        "Dinah: No, I just had an appointment. What are you doing here?",
        "Gus: I just had a little police business.",
        "Dinah: Good. I thought you might be here because of your leg. How is it doing?",
        "Gus: I'm fine. I get little twinges, but I can handle it.",
        "Dinah: Good. Harley is going to need you to be strong. With Alan-Michael and Beth and Alan. I don't know.",
        "Gus: She needs you, too. You need to be there for her. She can count on you, right?",
        "Dinah: You bet.",
        "Gus: I've got to take care of this.",
        "Dinah: See ya.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: So, what are we talking about?",
        "Harley: We're talking about Dinah.",
        "Frank: Oh, well, I'll tell you right now, she's a great girl, and you are a very lucky guy.",
        "Mallet: Thanks, Frank, as long as you approve.",
        "Frank: I do, I do. And you've got Gus, and thank God you're okay with him. You guys are very good together. So, I think we can honestly say here things are working out for some of us.",
        "Harley: Hmm.",
        "Mallet: Cool.",
        "Frank: Cheers.",
        "Mallet: Knock on wood.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Great. Okay. We've got ourselves a checkbook, some facial tissues...",
        "Dinah: Hey.",
        "Gus: Hey.",
        "Dinah: Can I have a hug.",
        "Gus: Of course, what is the matter?",
        "Dinah: I just want a hug. I love your hugs. That's perfect, thank you. Okay, I've got lots to do. So, um, I'm glad you're feel better. You have a good one, okay?",
        "Gus: You, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Okay, where do these go?",
        "Cassie: These go right here, and you're going right out that door. Thank you for all of your help. But you have to stop now, you've gone above and beyond the call of duty.",
        "Josh: Okay. Listen, you did a good thing. You will make Reva happy. I've been thinking about another present for her. I'm going to try to get Cross Creek back.",
        "Cassie: Reva would love that.",
        "Josh: I think so, too. It has always meant a part of or past, and I want it to be part of our future. To show her we have a future. Now, wrestling it away from Olivia, that will be another thing. Thank you for an interesting night.",
        "Cassie: Thank you for being bodyguard and friend all wrapped in one. I'll find a way to repay you.",
        "Josh: Yeah, you get on that.",
        "Cassie: Olivia, hi, it's Cassie. Do you have a minute? I want to talk to you about Cross Creek. I know someone who would really like to take it off your hands. Yes, it's Josh, but before you say no, hear me out. I'm prepared to sweeten the deal, no matter how much it costs me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Oh, that went a million times better than I thought it would. You and my mom were not just making nice. You were acting like friends.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, let's not get carried away. I saw her finger on the knife a few times.",
        "Tammy: But she didn't pick it up. And she is not fighting us anymore. What about me, did I pass my test? I didn't go running for the hills.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, yeah, but you can still earn some extra credit?",
        "Tammy: Oh, how is that?",
        "Jonathan: Well, follow me in the back, and I'll show you. ( Cell phone rings ) Yeah.",
        "Lizzie: You and your stupid ideas.",
        "Jonathan: I don't have time to talk right now.",
        "Lizzie: Make time, because I followed your advice about Coop, and I just pushed him even closer to Ava. Now they're talking about going to England together.",
        "Jonathan: That's tough, but not my problem.",
        "Lizzie: I need to see you. I need you in my bed tonight.",
        "Jonathan: No way.",
        "Lizzie: Find a way, or I am going to tell Tammy everything we did, and I mean everything.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Lizzie: Ooh, you do like it a little rough, don't you. I am looking to feel good and you are more than qualified for the job.",
        "Alan-Michael: What's it going to be, it's your call, Marina. Decide what you want, all or nothing?"
