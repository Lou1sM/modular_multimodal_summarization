In a couple of hours, harley's going to be sentenced. And it's going to be awful. So let's all try to make it as easy on her as we can.

Yes, this is going to be very hard on harley.", "Buzz: Frank. Frank, if you lose it like that in front of harley, I don't think she's going to be able to take it.", "Frank: My little sister's going to prison. I saw that scar on harley's arm and realized that she was ruth karloff, i could have walked away.", "Buzz: Frank...", "Frank: No, I could have walked away, dad. This is all my fault.", "Buzz: Frank, you were doing your job. Don't start blaming yourself.", "Frank: Then who should i blame, dad? Huh? Who?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: So you slept with bill lewis. And you're not even smart enough to deny it.", "Harley: Because i don't owe you an explanation. We're not a couple anymore. Hey, ever since the verdict, i have been trying to tell you to move on, but you refused to get the picture.", "Gus: So what? You jump into bed with somebody? It's like that now?", "Harley: Not anybody, okay. My friend. My good friend.", "Gus: How does his wife feel about it?", "Harley: He had a fight with olivia, he stopped by and I'm sorry that you had to see it, okay. I'm sorry...", "Gus: You're not sorry about anything. You set this up. You did this on purpose. Because you finally figured out a way how to push me away forever, right?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: So do you want to find out the sex or not?", "Josh: It's a little soon, don't you think?", "Reva: I don't mean right now. I mean when the time comes.", "Josh: Oh.", "Reva: What do you think?", "Josh: I know that's what you meant.", "Reva: ( Laughs )", "dr. Sedwick: Reva, josh.", "Josh: Hello.", "Dr. Sedwick: I'm sorry to keep you waiting. I have a patient in the delivery room and the contractions are getting closer.", "Josh: Oh, contractions. That's something for you to look forward, huh?", "Reva: Yeah, i'm going to make him pay for that. So am I right? I'm right, right. I'm pregnant?", "Dr. Sedwick: Let's go in here. We can have a talk.", "Reva: Oh, oh. This is where she warns us that i'm too old for this. That i'm going to have to have amino and a whole bunch of other tests. But you know what? I say bring on the test, because we are so ready for this, right?", "Josh: Yes, we are. Bring it on.", "Dr. Sedwick: I'm sorry to disappoint. But you're not pregnant.", "Reva: I'm not? But I've been nauseous, I've been tired. I missed a period.", "Josh: No? We know the test she took at home was... Was...", "Dr. Sedwick: No, she's not pregnant. But there is another reason for your symptoms.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: What is this?", "Edmund: Cassie, you're back.", "Cassie: Edmund, what's going on? What's all this stuff?", "Edmund: It's for our baby.", "Cassie: Our baby?", "Edmund: Cassie, please. If you just sit down, I can explain.", "Cassie: No, don't.", "Edmund: No, cassie, please. Please. I know this doesn't make much sense right now. But if you sit down I can make everything--", "cassie: I don't want to sit, edmund. I just really need to give you these. Our separation papers.", "Edmund: You can't possibly want that, cassie.", "Cassie: What are you doing? Edmund, what is all this? Did you think that if you went and bought all this stuff that i would come back? That i would see this swing and i'd see all the baby clothes and then my heart would just melt?", "Edmund: Cassie, we wanted to have a baby so much. We loved each other enough to go through months of fertility treatments. You want this, cassie. We both do.", "Cassie: You can't possibly think that i would go to the clinic now. That i would want to go through this entire process again after everything that's happened. Edmund.", "Edmund: No, but, cassie, you don't have to go back to the clinic.", "Cassie: What?", "Edmund: Cassie, i love you. And I know... No, please. Listen. And I know you love me too. We had a dream together. And that dream could still happen. As matter of fact it's already happening.", "Cassie: You're not making any sense. And you're really starting to scare me, okay.", "Edmund: No, cassie. Please, please. The last thing you should be scared. Here it is. We are going to have a baby. As a matter of fact, there's a baby on the way.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Josh: Dr. Sedwick, maybe you should redo the tests. I mean, reva's been pregnant several times before. She... She knows.", "Dr. Sedwick: No, the test is inclusive.", "Reva: Well, i've had all the classic symptoms, though.", "Dr. Sedwick: All the symptoms that you have described to me are hormonally related. And sometimes they mimic the symptoms of pregnancy and then other times they can mean something else.", "Reva: Wow. ( Laughs ) I mean, already?", "Josh: What do you mean wow? I mean already? What? What are talking about? What happened? What's wrong?", "Reva: Nothing is wrong. It's all just part of life, right? I'm no where close to being pregnant, because I probably will never be pregnant again, because I'm going through menopause.", "Dr. Sedwick: Well, actually the stage you're in now is pre- menopause or peri- menopause. Look, I've got to check on my patient. And I'll come back and then we can talk.", "Reva: Well, that is something i didn't expect.", "Josh: I was so positive you were pregnant.", "Reva: Yeah, me, too.", "Josh: I was looking forward to it.", "Reva: Me, too.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: Granddad?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: Elizabeth, I'll... I'll wait out here. You go ahead in. Don't you ever give my granddaughter orders again. Do you understand? Do i have to remind of who owns this place?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Buzz: You want to get popped? Because if you do, you're batting a thousand.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: You have a couple of hours before your sentence and you do this. Is this really the way that you want to say good-bye?", "Harley: I'm sorry.", "Gus: You're precious time. No, you're... This is your last night to be... Last night. I mean, I could... I could have come over. We could have...", "Harley: You could have, what? We could have been together? No, gus. That's the point. No!", "Gus: Just tell me that you didn't sleep with him. Tell me...", "Harley: You just saw it for yourself.", "Gus: I don't know what I saw! I saw two people in bed half naked! I don't know. Okay?", "Harley: You just don't like to believe it, okay.", "Gus: Did you like it? Did like sleeping with him? Did you like it?", "Bill: Gus, gus, gus. Calm down.", "Gus: You should be with your wife, okay. You should be with your wife!", "Bill: She was hurting last night. She still is.", "Harley: I needed someone to hold me, okay. Somebody who wasn't you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: Why do you keep saying that we're going to have a baby, edmund?", "Edmund: Cassie, i know this is a lot to absorb and i hate to be springing it on you like this.", "Cassie: If you really... If you really believe this then...", "Edmund: Then I must be crazy. Then i must be crazy. ( Laughs ) cassie, I am crazy. I am crazy. I'm crazy... I'm crazy to be this in love with you. I am crazy to believe that you're actually coming back to me. But I do believe it, cassie. I believe it. I have to believe it. That's why i did this. I did it for us. I did it for our future.", "Cassie: You did what?", "Edmund: I found a gestational carrier. A surrogate to carry your... Cassie your eggs have already been harvested and fertilized. And there was only a tiny window of opportunity to implant them. And so i seized the opportunity.", "Cassie: Oh, my god.", "Edmund: Cassie, i couldn't lose that opportunity. We had worked so hard for it. We couldn'T... We couldn't lose the opportunity, cassie. And the doctor said we had to make a decision and I didn't know where you were and i couldn't find you and so i made the decision. To...?", "Cassie: You got someone to...? Without even asking me? How could you?!", "Edmund: Cassie, cassie, i know... I know this is a lot. A lot. It's a lot to digest. But I think when you give yourself the time to think about it--", "cassie: I don't want to think about it!", "Edmund: When you give yourself the time to think about it, I know that you'll come to the same choice that i did. Cassie, what i did was a vote of confidence in us, in our love, in the family we want to build together. Cassie, cassie, look. The woman signed a contract. She signed a contract. We are protected. It is all legal. The child is one hundred percent ours.", "Cassie: Oh, my god. I mean, you... Oh, my god. I'm going to be sick. I've got to get out of here, edmund.", "Edmund: But cassie... Cassie, wait. Cassie, come back. Cassie, come back!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dr. Sedwick: So, I'll give you a blood test and we can check your hormone levels.", "Reva: So I will probably taking what? Hormone supplements?", "Dr. Sedwick: Oh, no. At this stage probably not. Actually, it often works out that if you watch your daily diet and intake certain vitamins and certain supplements, it will control the symptoms. ( Phone rings ) oh. Oh, my patient.", "Reva: The one that's in labor?", "Dr. Sedwick: Yes. I really have to get back to her. Call the office, okay, and get an appointment.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: Okay. Thanks, dr. Sedwick.", "Josh: Thank you, dr. Sedwick.", "Reva: Well...", "Josh: It's a lot to absorb. You okay.", "Reva: Yes. I'm fine. Let's get out of here.", "Josh: Sounds good to me.", "Reva: You know what?", "Josh: What?", "Reva: I'm going through the change. I didn't just suddenly turn 90. And if you start treating me like an old lady, I'm going to whoop you upside the head.", "Josh: I love you, too, sweetheart.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: I told you to move on. But you did the opposite. You became obsessed to the point where you made yourself sick. You could have killed yourself.", "Bill: Yeah, i'm going to go inside.", "Gus: Why don't you do that, bill?", "Harley: No, please stay, bill. You know, when i went to your apartment that night...", "Gus: It meant nothing to you.", "Harley: It meant everything to me. Until I realized you had moved to within shouting distance of the prison so you could be closer to me. There's no half way with us, gus.", "Gus: Fine. Whatever.", "Harley: We don't know how to do that.", "Gus: Are you done with your little emotional breakdown or meltdown, whatever it is? Get your stuff. You're going with me. Let's go.", "Harley: I'm not going with you. I have to be in court in an hour.", "Gus: Yes, i'm taking you to the court.", "Harley: You're not listening to me, okay. I have moved on, okay. I've moved on. Now you need to move on, too.", "Gus: This is not... This is not... This is wrong. This whole thing is so wrong.", "Harley: I'm not discussing this with you anymore, okay. You need to go. Now.", "Gus: You did this for me? You did this for me? I'm supposed to be happy. Thank you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: That was... That was rough. He still loves you, harley. You know...", "Harley: That was horrible. Did you see his face? Did you see how hurt he was in his eyes?", "Bill: Harley, i'm sorry.", "Harley: I had to do it. I had do it. Okay, now, listen to me. I know this has been awful for you too, but if gus should come to you, if he starts questioning you about what happened here tonight...", "Bill: Wait a minute.", "Harley: Because i know he will. Because that's how he is.", "Bill: Harley.", "Harley: Please, bill. Please.", "Bill: Yeah. Oh, yes. Oh, yes, i know.", "Harley: I mean, i know it's tough, because what if olivia's finds out. Do you think that you can do it?", "Bill: Look. Hey, hey, listen to me. Listen to me. Don't worry about me, don't worry about olivia, okay. Now what's going to happen when you're at the courthouse and you see gus? Are you going to be able to keep it together?", "Harley: I don't want him there. He can't be there.", "Bill: All right, well, maybe there's something you could do. Maybe I'll talk with frank. I don't know.", "Harley: Yeah, that's good. That's good. Talk, talk, talk to frank.", "Frank: Okay, okay. Okay.", "Harley: What time is it? Oh, god, i've got to go. I've got to go. It's time for me to go.", "Bill: Okay.", "Harley: To the courthouse and find out what they're going to do to me. Thank you. Coming up on \"guiding light\"...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: As the victim's father, I want to say something to the court before the final decision is made.", "Buzz: What are you going to say, alan?", "Alan: You will hear when everyone else does.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: Here are the separation papers. There's no other way to handle this. And we cannot go back.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: I'll keep working on your appeal. It won't be long, baby. It won't be long.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Cassie didn't listen to me. She didn't listen to me. I knew this was going to be a shock to her, but when she heard about the baby, our baby, i didn't expect her to forgive me immediately or anything but...", "Dinah: Edmund, I thought you were great. If she didn't hear the love in that.", "Edmund: All she heard was desperation.", "Dinah: You weren't desperate.", "Edmund: God, dinah, i was desperate. I was desperate to get her back. I'm a desperate man, which is exactly why I kept your name out of it. I had to do it in the exact right way and I just... I didn't do it. I didn't do that. That's all right. That's all right. I'm going to... I'm going to regroup. I'm going to regroup and just think of another angle.", "Dinah: You know i...", "Edmund: I'm in this for the long haul. I just have to think about the next step.", "Dinah: I think I know what the next step should be and that's that I leave now. Yeah.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: I am so, so sorry.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Josh: If there's anything we can do to help. Anything at all.", "Cassie: Oh, my god, it's today? Harley, I'm so sorry.", "Harley: It's okay. No, it's okay. It's okay. Really, you know? It's kind of a relief, actually, at this point. The sooner i get into prison, the sooner i get out.", "Cassie: I want to be there. Okay? I'm going to come and be there when you hear?", "Josh: We'll be there, too.", "Harley: Thanks for offering, but really, don'T. This is hard enough as it is. You can visit me. You can bring cookies or something. I have to get inside because mel is my lawyer and we need to talk about something. Let's just say quick good-byes.", "Harley: I thought gus was your lawyer.", "Harley: I had to let him go. You know, not just as my lawyer. He would have held on forever. I'm very lucky to have a friend like mel who'd step in like this.", "Cassie: He would have held on because he loves you, harley.", "Harley: I'm doing it for him. Please understand. Someone please understand, okay, because... I need my friends right now. I'm going to go because... Um... But you can talk to my dad and frank to get the information on how to get in touch with me.", "Cassie: Okay. I'm going to come visit you wherever you want to see me and i'll bring you cookies and i will... I'll spend time with the boys, I promise you that. I love you.", "Harley: I love you. I love all of you. Um... Hey, do me a favor. Help my dad with the boys. They could come to your farm and that would make it easier for them because it's going to be really hard.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: Oh, what is going on today?", "Reva: Why? What else happened?", "Cassie: Nothing. Nothing. I am just so sick of me. What's going on with you? How did your appointment go with dr. Sedwick, new how far along are you?", "Reva: ( Laughs ).", "Cassie: What's wrong?", "Reva: Nothing, really. Nothing's wrong. It's just there's not a baby. I'm not pregnant after all.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: Alan, lizzie.", "Lizzie: We came to get good seats.", "Alan: Elizabeth, why don't you go in and I'll be in in just a moment. I need to speak with mr. O'neil.", "Lizzie: Sure.", "Alan: I have a request. I know the judge has discretion in the sentencing and as the victim's father, i want to say something to the court before the final decision is made.", "Jeffrey: What do you want to say?", "Alan: Will you tell the judge, or would you like me to?", "Jeffrey: What are you going to say, alan?", "Alan: You will hear when everyone else does.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Okay. Hey, you guys, mommy has to talk to you for a second, okay? You remember how i said that i had to go away? I have to go away now.", "Zach: Right now?", "Harley: Right now. But it will be okay, because look at everybody you have. You have coop and you have daddy and you have grandpa and uncle frank and mel and blake and her kids and all these people to play with.", "Zach: I don't want them. I want you.", "Harley: Come here. You know what? I can call you guys all the time and we can talk on the phone and i can write you letters and you can make me pictures. It's gonna be okay, I promise. It'll be okay. Just be good to each other, okay and love each other. And always look out for each other.", "Frank: Harley...", "Harley: Okay. Give me a kiss. Um, rick, mel's going to come with me. Can you....", "Rick: It's fine. I'll stay here with the boys.", "Harley: Okay. Let's all pile into the limo. What, no limo? ( Gavel banging )", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "judge: Miss cooper, you have been found guilty of murder in the second degree. In determining your sentence, the court has carefully considered all the facts of your case. I've also had a request from the victim's father, alan spaulding, to speak to the court. I'll hear what mr. Spaulding has to say and then I'll give you my final determination. Mr. Spaulding?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Buzz: Don't let him do this.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Mel: He can do this; he's the victim's family.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: Frank?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Frank: You are not wanted in there.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Judge: Go ahead, mr. Spaulding.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: Thank you, your honor. My son was taken away from me in the prime of his life. You've just said that you have received many letters asking you to show mercy for miss cooper in her sentencing. Well, I am here to speak for my son phillip and I know that you will honor his wishes because when it comes to sentencing, miss cooper, i know that my son would want you to be as lenient as possible.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dinah: Once everything you've said has a chance to sink in with cassie, i know she'll be back. She will. And for now I think that this is the best thing for us.", "Edmund: Dinah... Come on. Let me put this in the car for you. And thank you for understanding.", "Dinah: Thank you. Thank you for being so good to me.", "Edmund: Well, you're carrying my child. Cassie's and my child. And she'll understand. She'll love this baby and then she'll come back to me.", "Dinah: Yes, i know she will. Why would she ever turn down an opportunity to be with you or with your baby? I'm going to be at my tower's suite for the next few days and then i'll look for a real apartment.", "Edmund: Good. Good. Find a nice place. Don't worry about the cost, I'll take care of it.", "Dinah: I don't expect you to pay for anything.", "Edmund: No, i will, dinah. I will. Please. Come on, after you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: Those poor little boys.", "Cassie: Are you okay? Not being pregnant and then the other thing?", "Reva: Menopause. You can say it out loud! Ha, ha, ha! ( Laughs ) I'm fine. I am. I can handle it all. I can handle the night sweats. I can handle the hot flashes. I can handle the irritability and the loss of libido.", "Cassie: Loss of libido? You?", "Reva: I don't buy that, either, do you? Actually, I guess this is just someone's way of telling me that i need to pay attention to the children that I already have. You know, concentrate on loving them.", "Cassie: Yeah. I'm sorry.", "Reva: I'm sorry.", "Cassie: Why?", "Reva: That you're not having a baby, either. Do you know that i was shopping, I was. And I was trying to decide what to do about the nursery and thinking about the smells and the little toes and the pudgy little knees. But now neither one of us are getting what we want, are we? But life goes on. It does. It goes on, which brings me to my next question. Have you and edmund decided what you're going to do yet?", "Cassie: No. Not yet. I've got to go. I have to go.", "Reva: Sure.", "Cassie: I'll call you, okay?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: Boy, it is a beautiful day, isn't it? What do you say we go to the park and play some baseball.", "Josh: Get in a little batting practice.", "Rick: That's right. Josh taught his son how to pitch. He made the pros. You know what, son? Mommmy is going to be back soon, I promise, okay?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Zach: I miss her. I want her back now.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: Hi, guys. You're worried about your mom, aren't you? Yeah. You're probably pretty afraid, too. Well, I understand that because i'm a mommy, too, and I have two little boys just like you guys. That's why i really want you to listen to me when I tell you that a mommy's love is so strong. It is the strongest, the most powerful, bestest thing in the whole world. And a mommy never gives up on her babies. And she never really leaves.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: Get out of my way.", "Frank: Walk away. Don't make me call my men.", "Gus: I'm not scared of you.", "Frank: My sister asked me to stay here to make sure you got the message.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: I'll never be able to get back the time that i've lost with my son, and in saying that i want to remind you that there are children involved here. My grandson, alan, jr.; Zach. Zach has already lost his father and to take away his mother from him would be like punishing him. So i ask you, your honor, to please, please give her the lightest sentence possible so that she can get back to her children, my grandchildren, and be the mother, the loving mother that i know she will be. That's all i have to say, your honor. Thank you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Judge: Mr. O'neill? Is there anything further you'd like to say before i proceed?", "Jeffrey: My office has made its position clear, your honor. We support a lesser sentence in this case.", "Judge: Mrs. Bauer, anything more from your side?", "Mel: No, your honor.", "Judge: Miss cooper, would you like to make a statement before i pass sentence? Harley:, Yes, please. Your honor, I want you to know, if i want everyone here to know that ever since I was arrested and charged with phillip's murder, I've been wishing for a time machine so that i could go backwards to way before the night he died and change my behavior so maybe none of this would ever have happened. Maybe we wouldn't ever have gotten to this point. As for my part in this terrible tragedy, i take full responsibility. I can only ask forgiveness. I know that we'll all carry on and do what we have to do to make things right, but it's phillip's children, his family that i know will suffer for a long time to come. My thoughts and prayers are with them. Thank you.", "Judge: I'll pass sentence now. The defendant will please rise again.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Josh: You're allowed, you know.", "Reva: Allowed what?", "Josh: To be disappointed. To cry. To rant, rave, throw furniture, dump a drink on my head, whatever you need to do.", "Reva: You know, it's your disappointment, too.", "Josh: I know that. It's funny, you know, I think i was really getting the idea of having another baby with you, raising a child together. But I also like the idea of being footloose and fancy free in our golden years.", "Reva: Excuse me?", "Josh: Our twilight years.", "Reva: Please? Golden's bad enough. Twilight?", "Josh: I read it in a pamphlet in dr. Sedwick's office. It sounds good to me: Globetrotting, staying up to the wee hours, taking up new and interesting hobbies like skydiving.", "Reva: I was thinking of ski jumping myself.", "Josh: That works for me. Listen, that other news you got today, what dr. Sedwick said, it's just part of life.", "Reva: I know! It's a minor part, a blip on the screen! ( Laughs ) I need some more water. Do you mind? Thanks, sweetie.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Cassie, i won't...", "Cassie: I didn't come here to kiss and make up. Here are the separation papers. There's no other way to handle this, and we cannot go back, so here.", "Edmund: Cassie, really, when you hear what I have to say.", "Cassie: I don't want to hear anything from you, okay? I want to talk, edmund. I am so furious with you. I don't know how you could have done something like this without consulting me first. But you know what? That doesn't matter anymore. Because now there's a baby in the picture. A baby that's a part of me.", "Edmund: And me.", "Cassie: Maybe i can walk away from you.", "Edmund: Maybe?", "Cassie: But i cannot walk away from my own child.", "Edmund: Our child, cassie. Our child, because we made this child together. Now, i'm not going to try to force you into my way of thinking. I'm not going to force you to love me again, cassie, because i know that you still do love me. And I know that as the months go by, this is going to bring us together. I know it will because i know you want this, too.", "Cassie: I want details. I want details. Is the baby healthy? Edmund? You know, I don't even know this woman. You found someone to carry our baby and i don't even know anything about her.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dinah: Yes, you do. It's me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Judge: As i said earlier, I've given careful consideration to the statements submitted on the defendant's behalf. You claimed remorse just now, miss cooper, but i have yet to hear you state to this court that you killed mr. Spaulding. I find your sentiments just now too little, too late. I hear sentence you to a term of 25 years to life in the state penitentiary. You will be eligible for parole after 15 years. Guard, take the prisoner into custody.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Buzz: This will never stand up on appeal.", "Frank: We'll find the real killer.", "Coop: The boys will visit you everyday.", "Harley: I'm okay.", "Frank: Can't we say good-bye?", "Buzz: Take it easy!", "Harley: I don't think it works that way, dad. Why did you say what you just said?", "Gus: Harley, baby?", "Frank: I told him to say what to stay out of here.", "Frank: Do you remember? I will never, ever, let you go, ever.", "Harley: Tell my boys everyday that i love them.", "Gus: Just for a second.", "Gus: Listen to me.", "Frank: Get him back!", "Gus: I'm going to keep working on your appeal. It won't be long, baby, it won't be long. I'll keep working on your appeal!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[NEXT_ON]", "Edmund: Dinah was there when the embryos were...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: No! No! No! Edmund, no! No!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jonathan: Look, i don't need you to come here, okay? Because I don't have reva where i want her yet. Why don't you just stay put where you...
