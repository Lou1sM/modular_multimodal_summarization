        "Danny goes to Father Ray's church but Jeffrey follows him to threaten him with prosecution if he decides not to go back into the mob. When Father Ray comes to congratulate Danny, he brushes off his praise and goes to speak to God in private. Alone in the confession booth, Danny rails at his fate and the family legacy that he can never escape. At the hospital, Marina, Shayne, Billy and Josh have come to check on Marah, who fainted after her most recent brush with Carrie. They try to comfort her but their forced optimism only makes Marah feel worse and she takes off out of the hospital. Marina, Michelle and Shayne then go to Buzz, Ed and Josh and Billy, respectively, to be sure that Carrie's arrest has put an end to her hold on them. At the end of the day, the five men gather at Maryanne's gravesite to make a new pact. Jeffrey finds Marah at the fairgrounds where she confronts the detritus from the old funhouse. She laments on what Carrie has done to her and how she can't forget about the violence. Jeffrey, hurting for her and struggling with his own conflicted soul, wraps her in his arms and takes her home with him."

    "Transcript": [
        "Danny: What? Did you come for some silent reflection, or are you just following me?",
        "Jeffrey: Just wanted to make sure that...",
        "Danny: That I didn't do anything drastic?",
        "Jeffrey: I'm concerned, danny.",
        "Danny: (Clears throat)",
        "Jeffrey: Come here a lot?",
        "Danny: My cousin's the priest here.",
        "Jeffrey: So you buy into all that stuff, you know, confessions and things like that?",
        "Danny: No sense in that when I've got other people to rub my sins in my face, right? What about you, o'neill? On the side of the angels, destroying people's lives all in the name of justice. Your conscience must be as clear as a spring day. Nothing for you to feel guilty about, am I right?",
        "Billy: How's she doing?",
        "Josh: The doctors gave her a clean bill of health.",
        "Billy: But?",
        "Josh: She fainted, billy. Remy came home, found her passed out, called an ambulance...",
        "Billy: Well, you stress a kid out to the max, and then she doesn't sleep, she doesn't eat, something's going to give.",
        "Josh: I know. I was just hoping that she'd be able to relax a little bit now that carrie's been locked up.",
        "Billy: You know, I really would have liked to have been there to see that old bat confess. It would have done my heart good.",
        "Josh: Right.",
        "Billy: You think now that you know the truth maybe you'll sleep better at night?",
        "Josh: No. How about you?",
        "Billy: No, not really.",
        "Shayne: Dad. How is she?",
        "Josh: Hey, son.",
        "Shayne: Hey.",
        "Josh: Take a look.",
        "Marina: Can we go in and see her?",
        "Josh: Yeah, I think that would be fine.",
        "Marina: Hey, honey, we can go in.",
        "Shayne: Hey, you.",
        "Marah: Hey.",
        "Marina: Hey.",
        "Marah: Did you hear?",
        "Marina: About carrie? Yeah. Your dad called to tell me about her and about you. You fainted, huh?",
        "Marah: I just lost it.",
        "Marina: It's almost too much to believe, about carrie.",
        "Marah: I know. Poor maryanne.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, but it's a good thing for us. I mean, now that... now that carrie's in jail, there's not going to be a trial, so you and dad, everybody, you guys are all in the clear. It's over. It's over.C",
        "Josh: Marah's right, you know that? This thing is not over. Have you thought about... have you thought about this? If we had looked for maryanne just a little bit longer, if we had called the police like we should have done, we might have been able to stop carrie from strangling her. But we didn't do that. We were too worried about us. In a sense, we are still responsible for maryanne's death.",
        "Billy: Well, that's just something we're going to have to live with from here on out.",
        "Josh: No. See, that's the way it should be, but that's not the way it is. Marah, she's the one who's suffering the most for our mistakes.",
        "Billy: Yeah. She's certainly been through it, that's for sure.",
        "Josh: I just want her to be happy again. I want to see her smile, but she can't do that. She's closed down. I just wish there was something I could do to help her, that's all.",
        "Marah: You know what? I don't need any more of this.",
        "Shayne: No, no, no. Wait. Hey.",
        "Marah: You said it was over, right?",
        "Josh: Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Marah? Marah? You're supposed to be resting.",
        "Marah: I'm feeling better.",
        "Josh: Let me call the doctor who's on duty, okay?",
        "Marah: No, dad. I just... I want to go, okay?",
        "Marina: I should go see if marah's okay.",
        "Shayne: No, no. Hold on.",
        "Marina: Shayne. Marah just fainted. She shouldn't be up and around like this.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, yeah. Look. Yes, you guys were messed up by that nut, carrie. But you're okay and you got through it. I mean, I think... I think it would do you guys good to be able to celebrate getting through it, you know? Celebrate the fact that you're free.",
        "Marina: Doesn't exactly seem like the kind of thing you celebrate. But you might be on to something.",
        "Josh: Just slow down for a minute, okay? Just talk to us. I know it seems impossible right now that you're going to be able to carry on one day, but you will, marah. You've got everything going for you.",
        "Billy: Look, you're bright, you're intelligent, you're good- looking. I mean, the whole world's waiting there for you. (Voice distorted): The whole world's waiting for you.",
        "Josh (distorted): You can get back to your design work, maybe come up with a new line for next year.",
        "Billy (distorted): Hey, six months from now, things will be so good...",
        "Josh (distorted): You'll do good things again. Maybe even do another fashion show fundraiser.",
        "Billy (distorted): Yeah, the last one was a big hit. It got the whole town...",
        "Marah: I have to go.",
        "Josh: At least let me bring the car around.",
        "Jeffrey: I don't have the luxury of feeling guilty, danny.",
        "Danny: Too busy with your job?",
        "Jeffrey: You know, you should learn not to take things so personally.",
        "Danny: Right. I know that one: \"It's just business.\"",
        "Jeffrey: Good. Then you understand. I need an answer, danny.",
        "Danny: Do I go back into my old line of work, this time as your undercover dog? Or do I say no and let you destroy me and my family, tony, bill lewis, cassie winslow?",
        "Jeffrey: The choice seems pretty clear, doesn't it?",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Jeffrey: But you make your own decision...",
        "Danny: Thank you.",
        "Jeffrey: ...And then get back to me by the end of the week.",
        "Danny: Oh. An ultimatum, a time limit all in one night. I'm loving this.",
        "Jeffrey: No one said it would be fun, danny, for anyone.",
        "Danny: You going to go find marah? Have a little fun with her while you're getting ready to tear her friends and family apart?",
        "Jeffrey: Marah has nothing to do with this, and I try to keep that part of my life separate from this one.",
        "Danny: Oh, but you can't, o'neill. You can'T. Believe me. I know. See, I tried. I tried to be the crime boss at work, the loving husband and father at home. It nearly destroyed my entire family.",
        "Jeffrey: I don't have a family, danny.",
        "Danny: You're thinking you're different from me.",
        "Jeffrey: Am I?",
        "Danny: Mm-hmm. Everybody likes to think that they're the exception to the rule, that they can have it both ways. I think it's called confidence. Until things fall apart. Then it's just called arrogance.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I'm not you. And I've been making these hard decisions my whole life, and i still am. Now it's your turn.",
        "Danny: Yeah, I can see why you wouldn't be big on church. You think the universe revolves around you.",
        "Ray: I thought I heard voices. Look who's in my church, the district attorney and our brand- new mayor. Congratulations.",
        "Danny: Oh, thanks. Thank you. The election hasn't been certified yet.",
        "Ray: Come on! You're the man. You are the man. What are you doing here? There's a big victory bash going on. I was on my way over.",
        "Danny: It's pretty much over. O'neill and I have some business to discuss.",
        "Ray: You were smart to back a winner.",
        "Jeffrey: (Laughs)",
        "Ray: Even smarter to encourage him to run in the first place.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that's me, the genius.",
        "Ray: Well, I thought I was a genius. I always knew this kid was meant for big things, good things. And I was right.",
        "Danny: Okay, save the speech, ray. The polls are closed.",
        "Ray: No. Our family-- our parents, grandparents, cousins, uncles-- they were all criminals. Let's face it; there's no other way to put it. But the crimes they committed, especially on fifth street, will be more than made up for with the good that danny can do and is doing for this city.",
        "Danny: I'm still a santos. Right, o'neill?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, our business is done here. Keep in touch. It was nice seeing you, father.",
        "Ray: Good night. Seemed like it was serious business.",
        "Danny: Everything is serious with that guy.",
        "Ray: You were just elected mayor. How could you not be thrilled?",
        "Danny: I am. I'm tired, ray. I'm just so tired. It was a tiring campaign.",
        "Ray: Danny, to say the least. You won. You won! And, yeah, you are a santos, which makes it even a greater accomplishment. To be honest with you, I never dreamed it was possible. Oh, sure, I prayed on it, but god knows, that's not always a guarantee.",
        "Danny: Well, it was definitely miraculous, the way i pulled ahead in the last few hours.",
        "Ray: Maybe my prayers did do the trick after all. Seriously, I heard you had a late surge of voters from fifth street that put you over the top.",
        "Danny: That's one rumor.",
        "Ray: You're not doubting? You won fair and square, right?",
        "Danny: Ray, look, some people are doubting. That's what o'neill and I were discussing. The da's office is opening an investigation.",
        "Ray: Then you fight. Do you hear me?",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Ray: Danny, you know who you are and what you've done.",
        "Danny: I know. Yeah, I know. I know. But, hey, if everything goes straight to hell, at least I got a glimpse of what my life could be like.",
        "Ray: Hey, don't talk like that, man. Come on. It's not over. It hasn't even started yet.",
        "Danny: Ray, I can see where things are heading.",
        "Ray: You know what I see? I see a guy with a crisis of faith. Look, I know you're full of doubts right now. I know you, danny. Come on, man. We both know things always have a way of working out in the end.",
        "Danny: But that isn't always enough, ray, is it, to just believe?",
        "Ray: What's left to you, then? Look, I'll hear your confession if it'll help.",
        "Danny: No, no. Thanks. I really just want to be alone right now.",
        "Ray: Okay. I'm proud of you.",
        "Danny: Okay. Thanks.",
        "Shayne: I don't know what it was... I wasn't caught up in this whole carrie thing, you know, so I don't know what it was like to experience it firsthand. But it seems to me that you guys should be happy. I mean, maybe not happy, but you shouldn't be scared anymore, now that carrie's gone.",
        "Marina: We let her get to us, and that feeling of being set up and manipulated, it doesn't go away so fast. Oh, god, I hate this. I mean, walking around like everything is normal, pretending that something terrible didn't happen, except something terrible did happen that almost wrecked all our lives, you know? And I figured that there was nothing I could do about it until you gave me an idea.",
        "Shayne: I did?",
        "Marina: Yeah. I can't do this anymore, and neither can any of you. (Gunshot) Oprah: See what happens after the show, next \"opra",
        "Jeffrey: Marah? Marah? What are you doing out here?",
        "Marah: How'd you know I was here?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I got a call that someone saw a car turn in off the road, so I had a feeling that it might be you.",
        "Marah: They're tearing the place down.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, they are. It's alan spaulding's orders. He owns the property.",
        "Marah: The funhouse will be gone.",
        "Jeffrey: It's all going to be gone, marah. All of it. Good riddance.",
        "Marah: Is it that easy?",
        "Jeffrey: What?",
        "Marah: To make something go away? You just tear it down, cart off the pieces?",
        "Jeffrey: Come on. Let me take you back to your car.",
        "Marah: Alan will probably put up some office building or something. People will come in to work every day and never even know what happened here.",
        "Jeffrey: Why did you come back?",
        "Marah: Everybody keeps saying that it's over, that carrie can't hurt us anymore. We're all just moving on.",
        "Jeffrey: You don't feel that you have?",
        "Marah: What I feel is the gun in my hand.",
        "Jeffrey: Marah...",
        "Marah: The handle of it against my palm, my finger against the trigger, the kick of the gun as I fire it. Do I feel like it's over, like I'm moving on? No. I don't think I'll ever feel that.",
        "Bill: Well, now I don't feel bad about leaving you.",
        "Michelle: Thanks.",
        "Bill: Dr. Bauer.",
        "Michelle: Hey. I thought you'd left.",
        "Ed: No, not yet. (Pager beeps) so, what's up with this? This is from you.",
        "Michelle: Yeah. I called you. Actually, marina had called me a little while ago and she helped put something into words that i was thinking about. See, tonight is like the greatest night of my and danny's life.",
        "Ed: But?",
        "Michelle: But I just feel that some things are still unsettled.",
        "Buzz: (Groans) maybe we all go back to that night in our heads just to make sense of it.",
        "Marina: Are you?",
        "Buzz: Oh, every day. It's not my idea of a good time.",
        "Marina: Grandpa, I don't want you to be stuck like this. I don't want any of us to be stuck like this. We should be able to think about other things.",
        "Buzz: Happier times?",
        "Marina: I hate myself like this. I mean, I'm looking over my shoulder. I'm waiting for the next disaster to hit.",
        "Buzz: That's not the marina i know.",
        "Marina: Exactly. There's got to be a way for us to deal with this. I mean, you've been through junk like this before, right? What did you do to get over it?",
        "Buzz: You know the answer. I ran.",
        "Shayne: I still don't get it. I don'T. I mean, you guys didn't kill that girl and marah didn't kill carrie, but it's like you guys have this huge weight on your shoulders and it just... you can't get rid of it.",
        "Josh: There are deeper issues, son.",
        "Shayne: That's what marina said. She said it stirred up some major issues.",
        "Billy: Well, she got that right.",
        "Shayne: Well, I want to help.",
        "Josh: I don't know that there's anything you can do to help.",
        "Shayne: Dad, look, it's been about me for months and months. I mean, the accident and then the operations, not being able to walk, and you supported me 100%. Now I'm back on my feet and i want to help you and marina. I want to make this better.",
        "Michelle: Is it getting better, dad?",
        "Michelle: Is it getting better, dad? Be honest. Can you look at me and not think about everything that we've gone through the past few months?",
        "Ed: So you're talking about now when I hit you. No, most days that's about all i can think about.",
        "Buzz: I was about your age when I hit on this thing called escape. Something got too intense, too scary-- bam!-- I'd be gone. Did the trick, you know, because whatever was bugging me was back there on the horizon. I felt safe again. The problem was that disappearing became my lifestyle. You know the story. I'd skip out-- the army, my family, my kids, you name it. I was just...",
        "Marina: What? What are you going to say?",
        "Buzz: You know that motorcycle I have parked out there behind the restaurant?",
        "Marina: Yeah.",
        "Buzz: Well, it's all gassed up and ready to go all the time. All I have to do is walk across the street-- I've got the keys right here in my pocket-- hop on, and I could be 20 miles out of town in 20 minutes. The truth is, I could still be that guy who takes off. I mean, I sure thought about it a couple of weeks ago.",
        "Marina: But you didn'T.",
        "Buzz: No.",
        "Marina: Why not?",
        "Buzz: I'm not sure. Maybe that lesson that I was too pigheaded to learn the other times I took off finally sank in. I mean, no matter how much you want out, no matter how quick you split, no matter how far you go, there is one thing you cannot outrun. Yourself.",
        "Ed: See, there are just times when I walk into a room, say, and you're there, and it's like I still... I think that I can still see the red marks of my hand on your face. And that just reminds me all over again of what I did and what I am.",
        "Michelle: Dad, look at me. It's not there. Okay? Look. It's not. It's in your mind and it's not in my heart.",
        "Shayne: So this whole thing started because of a pact, of a pact that the five of you made and that changed your lives. Now it's time to fix that.",
        "Josh: Some things can't be fixed, son.",
        "Shayne: Sure they can, by fixing yourselves.",
        "Marina: Hey, grandpa, can i see those keys? You didn't use them, and that's great. But as long as you keep beating yourself up about maryanne, as long as you hold on to that pain, there's a chance you could use those again. And if you did, you would kill everyone you left behind. I know that as soon as you feel better, I'm going to feel better. I think I can help.",
        "Michelle: You know, tonight marks a new beginning for danny and me. Before I can move on, I need to close the book on what happened before, so there's someplace that I need you to go tonight, for me.",
        "Danny: I was really starting to believe. Not in you. In how good life could be. I spent these past two years trying to turn my life around, dedicating myself to making up for the wrongs of my parents. Look at what I did. Fifth street is alive now. There are stores, parks, affordable housing. And yeah, I wanted to do more. It felt good. I wanted to make a difference. All right, I took some money, some dirty money, okay? Every month. But did it come from drugs or prostitution or gambling? No. And look at... look at all the good I did with it. So does that qualify me for redemption? Forgiveness? Something worth praying for? I guess, what's the point? Your man ray says prayers don't come with guarantees. I bet that's especially true when you're a santos. Maybe that's it. I'm miguel and carmen santos' son and I'll never be able to break free of that. There are no new beginnings, just past mistakes. And no redemption for them.",
        "Alan: Danny must be on top of the world.",
        "Michelle: You know, I have no idea where danny is right now. But I need to talk to you.",
        "Alan: Really? Why?",
        "Michelle: Yeah. There's someplace I think you need to be tonight.",
        "Alan: Where?",
        "Michelle: Well, it has to do with moving on.",
        "Alan: Now, if you're referring to the caruthers case, I have already told the police everything. Maryanne's death has been almost 30 years now, carrie's now in custody, so I have moved on. The only thing I'm concerned with is my business and my family. And speaking of business, if you'll excuse me...",
        "Michelle: Well, the others are waiting for you.",
        "Alan: Really? Who?",
        "Michelle: My dad, buzz, josh, billy. They're all at maryanne's grave.",
        "Alan: Well, I'm afraid i won't be joining that party. I'm not like these gentlemen.",
        "Michelle: What does that mean? You're better than they are?",
        "Alan: I don't allow my life to be ruled by guilt. As a matter of fact, the memories of the past are now being literally bulldozed down at the fairgrounds so that I can erect an office building.",
        "Michelle: Alan?",
        "Alan: Hm?",
        "Michelle: Can you look me in the eye and tell me that you'll never dream again of your car sailing off cutter's bridge? Because if you can say yes, and mean it, then you're right, you don't need to go there. But if you can't, then you know exactly where you need to be.",
        "Jeffrey: I know how upsetting this has been for you.",
        "Marah: (Scoffs) I'm not upset. I am furious at what carrie did, at what I let her do.",
        "Jeffrey: Don't do this. Don't punish yourself.",
        "Marah: Look at this place, though, jeffrey. Look. I mean, trapdoors and mirrors. I mean, these are the corniest tricks going, and I fell for it. Not just that, I fell for her stupid romantic stories and magic rings and all her talk of justice. I bought all of it.",
        "Jeffrey: We all want to believe that stuff. It's a lot prettier than the reality of things, marah. That's all.",
        "Marah: You want to know about reality? I'm not the innocent victim in all of this. I helped torture my own father. I made him suffer.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, marah. So, what, you're to blame? You're to blame for this, right? Carrie shares none of the blame.",
        "Marah: No. Hell, yeah, I blame her. I hated her. But I didn't let out any of that rage until I picked up that gun. And you know what? Maybe this is what I wanted all along. Maybe I was just waiting for the perfect...",
        "Jeffrey: You don't believe that. You don't believe that, and neither do I.",
        "Marah: Well, I shot her, didn't I?",
        "Jeffrey: You were trying to protect your father, marah!",
        "Marah: Yeah, that's the official story. But when my mother remembered that carrie was still alive, when she found out and everybody was saying how great it would be for my case, there was a part of me that thought, \"I blew it.\" Do you understand, jeffrey? I wanted her to die. I wanted to have killed her.",
        "Jeffrey: Stop it. Please. I know what it's like to feel that sense of self- loathing that you're feeling right now, marah. I know what it's like to hate the thought of what you've become. You can't let that take you over. It's not you, marah. It's not who you are.",
        "Marah: Who you are. Look at what she did to us, jeffrey. Look at what we've become.",
        "Marah: We were supposed to be fun, simple.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, we kind of blew right past that, didn't we?",
        "Marah: I never wanted to need you, to need your protection. I've made your life so complicated.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, you have. But I'm smiling, see?",
        "Marah: Not your eyes. You look sad.",
        "Jeffrey: That's because of all you've been through, marah. You know, the best part about living a complicated life is you get to feel really alive. You'll never feel more alive than you do right now.",
        "Marah: You don't make that sound very good. This isn't what you wanted. I know that. You fought so hard to not be bogged down by somebody.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, you know, sometimes life doesn't turn out the way you plan it.",

        "Billy: Necessary. Go ahead, josh.",
        "Josh: We've been given a second chance. Maybe we deserve it, maybe we don'T. But the fact is, we made a mistake a long time ago, a terrible mistake based on fear and selfishness. And we can't undo that, but maybe we can do better. From here on in that's what i think we need to be thinking about: Becoming the best men we can possibly be, becoming the kind of men that our kids can be proud of. The kind of men that we should have been the night that maryanne died. If we can do that, if we can accomplish that, then maybe we will have earned this second chance. And that's the kind of pact that I can live with for the next 30 years.",
