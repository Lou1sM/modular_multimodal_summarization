        "Ava and Coop go to their respective bedrooms at the boarding house and both blast themselves for not acting on their attraction for each other. Coop punches the wall and winds up punching a hole straight through to Ava's room. He comes over to apologize and she asks him to stay. They get into a playful fight with the spackling when Coop goes to fix it. Lizzie and Jonathan start kissing passionately and one thing leads to another and they have sex. Lizzie wants to use what happens so that both of them get what they want but Jonathan tells her to forget it ever happened. When Lizzie realizes that she left her bra in Jonathan's room, he goes to get it. Tammy shows up at the bar after a talk with Harley about not caring what other people think. After Lizzie quietly retrieves her bra without clueing Tammy in, Tammy tells Jonathan that she wants him back. Lizzie goes to the boarding house and letting herself into Coop's room sees him and Ava fooling around through the hole in the wall, she calls someone to have them check out everything on Ava. Alan and Alan-Michael go at it until Marina steps in and defends A-M. She corrects Alan when he calls her A-M's girlfriend though and later A-M tells Marina he will get the two things he wants, control over Spaulding and her. Alan goes to Towers where he runs into Gus and Dinah. Getting upset with Gus, Alan takes his cane and smacks Gus in the leg with it. Dinah sees Gus take one of his pills and after threatening Alan goes to talk to Harley. She tells her about the pain Gus is in and the pills and Harley asks Dinah to give her speech at the fundraiser Spaulding is throwing tonight. A-M later congratulates Dinah on getting what she wants from Harley, although Dinah swears not to know what he is talking about."

        "Lizzie: Jeez, you could have at least waited for me.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, well, I didn't.",
        "Lizzie: Pour me one, too.",
        "Jonathan: Look, little girl, you've had more than enough to drink for one night. Hey!",
        "Lizzie: You could have at least used the good stuff.",
        "Jonathan: Do you think this is going to help you forget about Coop?",
        "Lizzie: No. But at least I'll be drunk while I'm obsessing about him. It beats being sober. Why, are you telling me a couple more shots will make you forget about Tammy?",
        "Jonathan: I don't know, but I'm going to find out. You know, it wouldn't be so bad if I knew that she was as miserable as I am, you know.",
        "Lizzie: It's kind of twisted, but I actually get it.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I'll bet you do. It just wouldn't hurt so much if I knew that it cost her something to kick me out.",
        "Lizzie: Is that better?",
        "Jonathan: I heard you say you think about me all of the time.",
        "Tammy: I want to stop!",
        "Jonathan: You can't stop. You can't stop yourself, and this piece of paper can't stop you. ( Heavy breathing )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Hey, whoa! Hi.",
        "Ava: Hi. I didn't expect you up here so soon.",
        "Coop: Sorry. I thought you were already in your room. I didn't mean to...",
        "Ava: Yeah, well, I have an early shift in the morning. After today's drama, I don't know, I'm feeling kind of awake.",
        "Coop: Yeah, right. Warm milk and a boring book. I know it sounds kind of cheesy, but it usually works.",
        "Ava: For what?",
        "Coop: For insomnia.",
        "Ava: Oh! Right. Of course.",
        "Coop: Yeah. Well, anyway, look, I'll see you tomorrow. Okay?",
        "Ava: Bright and early.",
        "Coop: Yes, yes. Good night. Oh, my goodness. Good night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Maybe that's why you're girlfriend gave up on you, because she knows you're weak and will amount to nothing.",
        "Marina: He is not nothing. He is ten times the man you will ever be. Alan- Michael would have been better off being raised by a pack of wolves.",
        "Alan-Michael: Let's get out of here.",
        "Alan: No, no, no, no, no. It's starting to get interesting.",
        "Marina: You know, everyone always talks about how much Alan Spaulding loves his family. Tell me this: Name me one child of yours that even likes you. Go ahead, name one. That's what I thought. Tell me this: Did you ever even really love Alan-Michael?",
        "Alan: Of course I love Alan-Michael. I love all of my children.",
        "Marina: See, that's funny, because the way I see it, the only thing you ever did was make Alan-Michael feel inferior.",
        "Alan: I love this, your girlfriend sticking up for you.",
        "Marina: Ex-girlfriend. What? I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Jason, will you take a look at this speech, run it through a couple of spellchecks, and then another one, so I can make sure I'm not having any typos or anything during the speech?",
        "Jason: No problem.",
        "Dinah: Thank you.",
        "Gus: Hi, how's it going?",
        "Dinah: Hi, how are you?",
        "Gus: Good.",
        "Dinah: You look good.",
        "Gus: Thanks. So, Harley told me how you're throwing yourself into your work ever since what happened to your dad.",
        "Dinah: Yes, yes. I think that's probably the best thing I should be doing right now.",
        "Gus: I just want you to know that we both really appreciate you. You know, this event kind of marks her return, and I can tell she just really appreciates having you on her team.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: \"I'm Harley Cooper, CEO of Spaulding Enterprises, and on behalf of our entire workforce, I would like to welcome you all here tonight...\"",
        "Tammy: Sorry, I didn't realize you were working.",
        "Harley: I'm not really working. I'm practicing a speech. Come on in, this is the living room.",
        "Tammy: It's coming along.",
        "Harley: Yeah, it's coming along. It needs walls and floors, but we call it home.",
        "Zack: Can I show R.J. where my room is going to be?",
        "Harley: Sure, sure, be careful. You okay?",
        "Tammy: Yeah, sure,",
        "Harley: Really?",
        "Tammy: No. It is just life getting more complicated. You probably know about it.",
        "Harley: Yeah.",
        "Tammy: I bet you can't wait for this place to be finished and then something will be simple.",
        "Harley: Oh, gosh, it's our dream home. Our neighbors think we're crazy, but we're actually having a lot of fun. And you get to a point where you know it only matters what you think. It doesn't matter what anybody else thinks.",
        "( Heavy breathing )",
        "Jonathan: You know what this means.",
        "Lizzie: Yes. We both don't need to have clothes on...",
        "Jonathan: I'm just saying when it is done, it's over. We forget about it, okay?",
        "Lizzie: Stop worrying and talk less.",
        "Ava: \"After all of the drama today, I'm feeling really awake.\" Ava, you're such a dork.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: \"Why don't you just grab some milk and a nice book.\" That's great, Henry, that's real eloquent, great stuff.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: He's over Lizzie for like two seconds, if he is even over her at all, and then I kissed him, and it was so amazing, and I'm thinking to myself... I'm thinking to myself... it was so amazing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Oh, gosh, you have a chance to take it a little further with this beautiful girl, and what do you do, you just take it and throw it over a cliff. That's all you do. You're such an idiot. Stupid, that's what you are. You know why, you like this girl, you like her a lot, but you're just so stupid, so ahh!",
        "( Heavy breathing )",
        "Lizzie: So that's what it's like.",
        "Jonathan: What are you talking about? You're not a virgin.",
        "Lizzie: No, but it is different without feelings... you know, without feelings for each other.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, sometimes things like that happen.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I know. But we both want more.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, from other people. I mean that's what we did. We were mad, we got a little upset, had a few drinks, and that get-even sex. But that's all this is. It stops now. So maybe you should go.",
        "Lizzie: Just like that?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, just like that. Oh! Look, you know we agreed we were going to forget about it, so...",
        "Lizzie: Actually, you said that. I didn't. Will you just take a second to listen to what I'm saying? I love Coop too much to let him go.",
        "Jonathan: Good for you. That solves our problem how?",
        "Lizzie: My point is, I want Coop, but I know deep down somewhere he wants me, too. It is the same for you and Tammy.",
        "Jonathan: So?",
        "Lizzie: So why don't we work together to get them back. You're saying forget tonight. What I'm saying is we should use tonight. Face it, we still need each other.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I like the homey touch.",
        "Harley: Hmm? Oh, yes. I hung that up when Gus was missing. You know, holding onto hope, any kind of hope.",
        "Tammy: Hope.",
        "Harley: You and Jonathan?",
        "Tammy: We're over.",
        "Harley: Sorry, babe.",
        "Tammy: It's not like you and Gus. Everybody likes seeing you two together. It makes me believe in true love. Me and Jonathan, not so much.",
        "Harley: The cousin thing?",
        "Tammy: That's part of it. We're not made for each other like you and Gus are.",
        "Harley: Made for each other? You should ask our families about that.",
        "Tammy: It doesn't hurt you to love Gus the way loving Jonathan hurts me.",
        "Harley: Me and Gus hurt each other, plenty. We made a lot of mistakes. We've also gotten through a lot of stuff together. You get to a point where you can't even imagine your life without that person anymore. Sweetie, you're going to meet the person who is right for you someday. And I'm warning you, that's going to be tough, too, because you'll have to work out things with that person, also. I was going to stop construction on this place when Gus was missing, but then, I don't know, it became this thing for me to hang my hope on. Sort of a work in progress, I guess, like we are-- I mean, he and I are. We're never going to be perfect together, but we're not going to stop trying.",
        "Tammy: You must have been so happy to get him back after figuring you would have to spend your life without him?",
        "Harley: Well, I would never stop trying.",
        "Tammy: No.",
        "Harley: No, I would never stop trying. You know, you don't just give up on a love like that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Don't look at me like that.",
        "Jonathan: You seem like you were warming up to me there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: I don't think anyone deserves to be treated like that. Not even you.",
        "Alan-Michael: Oh, so I just happen to be your good cause of the day. No thanks. I can handle my dad without your help.",
        "Marina: Well, excuse me for caring.",
        "Alan-Michael: Oh!",
        "Marina: What?",
        "Alan-Michael: You care.",
        "Marina: I didn't mean it like that. I was just talking about it as an issue.",
        "Alan-Michael: An issue?",
        "Marina: Will you stop doing that?",
        "Alan-Michael: What?",
        "Marina: I'm trying to hate you.",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm making that hard for you?",
        "Marina: Just stop, stop confusing me.",
        "Alan-Michael: I don't understand why you're confused. It's simple: I want two things in my life, you and Spaulding Enterprises, and I'm not going to stop until I get both.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: I didn't know that Harley was looking at the policemen's ball as sort of her coming-out party.",
        "Gus: No. It is not like a huge deal.",
        "Dinah: I don't know if you've ever put one of these things together before, but, yeah, it is a big deal.",
        "Gus: No, I mean the announcement is not a big deal. But the thing is a big deal. That's why she is happy you're doing it all, putting it together, and the planning --",
        "Dinah: Is she planning to make a speech?",
        "Gus: I think she would just as soon skip any speech thing, but seeing it is her first event back as the CEO -- you're upset?",
        "Dinah: I'm a team player, and I'm on Harley's team, and this is going to be big. This whole policemen's ball, it will be a big thing, but it will be huge for all of us.",
        "Alan: Looky here, the inmates are running the asylum. Bourbon and water.",
        "Dinah: And as the most recent ex-con, I bet you feel right at home.",
        "Gus: What do you want, Alan?",
        "Alan: I want world peace, like everyone else, and a son who shows me a little respect.",
        "Gus: Excuse me. This is an Alan Spaulding-free zone. Maybe you didn't know the Springfield Police Department is honoring my wife tonight, the boss, the CEO of what used to be your company. The sooner you can get that through your head, I think the better. There ain't nothing you can do about it.",
        "Alan: We'll see about that.",
        "Gus: No, the only thing that we'll see-- actually, that you'll see-- is that she is going to be the CEO of what used to be your company for a very, very, very long time. So if you get those delusional thoughts of ever getting your big chair back, grab them and leave.",
        "Alan: That's very sad, Gus, because you and I have been through a lot. Especially in the last few months.",
        "Gus: Yes, we have.",
        "Alan: I thought we had come to some kind of understanding or respect.",
        "Gus: Really? I guess we haven't.",
        "Alan: No, no, I guess we haven't. That's a nice cane you have. No true Spaulding ever needed a crutch.",
        "Gus: I cannot even believe you would hurt your own son like that. I understand your arm is not healed completely, so you know what, I'll hit it myself if you don't move!",
        "Alan: You are one tough cookie, Dinah. You all right, son?",
        "Gus: I'll play any game you want to play. Fight you any way you want to fight. With our fists, in the boardroom, in the newspaper, you name it.",
        "Gus: I don't think the old lion likes the changing of the guard.",
        "Dinah: Can I call the doctor? Who's your doctor?",
        "Gus: No, I'm fine. I just need to just sit here for a second.",
        "Dinah: Gus, are you taking something, or can I get you something at all?",
        "Gus: No. I'm just not going to miss this night for anything in the world. Okay? This is her night.",
        "Dinah: If you are hurt, Harley will understand. You two need to stick together...",
        "Gus: I'm not going to steal her thunder and have her start worrying about me. She has come too far and worked too hard...",
        "Dinah: Gus, you're pushing it way two hard. I'm going to look for Harley.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: You want me and Spaulding.",
        "Alan-Michael: I'll have you both.",
        "Marina: A little overconfident for having already lost me.",
        "Alan-Michael: I'll win you back.",
        "Marina: Being cocky is no way to win my heart. We're done.",
        "Alan-Michael: I know you're probably sick of hearing this, but I'm sorry. My fight was never with Harley or your family...",
        "Marina: I know, Alan-Michael, Harley was just in the way of what you wanted, what you've always wanted. It was nothing personal.",
        "Alan-Michael: Look, Harley doesn't care if she runs Spaulding or not. But it is my fight, and I have to take on my father. Otherwise everything he said about me is true.",
        "Marina: I wish that you could see yourself the way that I see you. The way that I used to see you. You don't need Alan's approval for anything. You don't need to be a Spaulding to be someone.",
        "Alan-Michael: When we're together, you almost make me believe that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "( Laughter )",
        "Coop: Ah, oops. Yeah, my internet is on the fritz right now, so I figured I would do things a little bit more low-key. Howdy, how you doing?",
        "Ava: How's it going?",
        "Coop: Good. Great. You okay?",
        "Ava: I'm not the one who hit the wall. You did.",
        "Coop: Ah, yeah. I'll tell you what, would you mind if I came over and looked at the damage from your side? Is that okay?",
        "Ava: Ah, yeah, sure.",
        "Coop: All right. ( Knock on the door ) Hi, wow, I'm glad you opened the door, that way I don't have to bust through that, too.",
        "Ava: Good. It might be a strange question, but why did you put your wrist through my wall?",
        "Coop: Yeah, ah, um, I was boxing, the moving, you know, one-two, shadow boxing.",
        "Ava: Beating up your shadow.",
        "Coop: Something like that. He wouldn't leave me alone.",
        "Ava: What are we going to tell Buzz about this?",
        "Coop: That's a good point. We're not going to tell him anything. I'm going to fix it before he even sees it. If you don't mind.",
        "Ava: Like I said, I'm awake. It seems like a perfect time for home improvements.",
        "Coop: I'll go get some stuff. I'll be right back.",
        "Ava: Hey, wow.",
        "Coop: Yeah, um, so, um, can I do you first... no. No, I mean... the wall. Your side of the wall first.",
        "Ava: I would say knock yourself out, Coop, but I'm afraid you might take yourself too literally.",
        "Coop: That's cute. That's ha-ha, Ava. Why don't you give me a hand?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Some people seal a partnership with a handshake. I personally like the way we do business better.",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie, we are not friends or partners. We're just two people who have just seen each other naked.",
        "Lizzie: And that's something. Why don't we work together to get the people we love back.",
        "Jonathan: Work together how?",
        "Lizzie: You're a force of nature, we all get that. With a little bit of management, we could use that to actually get what we want. Hello, Jonathan, do you not want to get Tammy back.",
        "Jonathan: You don't want to help me get Tammy back. You just want me to help you get Coop.",
        "Lizzie: So?",
        "Jonathan: So. Sleep with another guy. Use him. I'm not getting involved.",
        "Lizzie: You're already involved.",
        "Jonathan: If you do one thing, say one word, manipulate one fact to hurt Tammy, you will be sorry. Look at me. Do you hear me?",
        "Lizzie: Yes.",
        "Jonathan: Good.",
        "Lizzie: I just thought we have both been jerked around. One day they want us, and then they don't want us, and then they want us again. I think Tammy and Coop should feel lucky if we want them back.",
        "Jonathan: Do you have your stuff.",
        "Lizzie: You're a walking attitude problem. Are you aware of that. My hoody and my bag are in the back, along with my bra.",
        "Jonathan: Your bra?",
        "Lizzie: You practically shoved me out of the room, okay?",
        "Jonathan: Fine. No, I'll get it. I don't even want you back there.",
        "Lizzie: Were you always this harsh with Tammy when you were sleeping with her?",
        "Tammy: Lizzie?",

        "Tammy: What are you doing here? Isn't the bar closed?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. Jonathan just let me stay for one more drink. I wasn't exactly enjoying the company down on Main Street, if you know what I mean.",
        "Tammy: I saw you there. I didn't know you guys were hanging out, though.",
        "Lizzie: Me and Jonathan? No, no, no, we don't even like each other. We just ran into each other.",
        "Tammy: Is he in the back?",
        "Lizzie: No! I mean of course Jonathan is back there but you can't get too close to him?",
        "Tammy: Why?",
        "Lizzie: You have a restraining order on him. Now you're following him. Make up your mind.",
        "Tammy: Not that it is any of your business, but it's not.",
        "Lizzie: Maybe it wasn't my business a couple of hours ago, but it is now.",
        "Tammy: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Jonathan: Hey.",
        "Tammy: Hey.",

        "Gus: Fantastic. Look at this, my family keeps crawling out of the woodwork. Why don't you back off a little, before I beat you with my cane.",
        "Marina: I'm okay.",
        "Alan-Michael: I'll go.",
        "Gus: We're not done. Sorry, I feel like I'm intruding on something.",
        "Marina: Yeah, you did.",

        "Dinah: I don't know if I should be telling you this.",
        "Harley: What? Just say it. What is it?",
        "Dinah: Gus came by Towers, and he seemed like he was in an awful lot of pain.",
        "Harley: Oh, his leg. I know, its bothering him. He thinks he's hiding it from me.",
        "Dinah: \"Bothering him\" might be an understatement. I think he's hurting pretty bad. He was going on and on about how proud he is of you, and, my goodness, how he doesn't want anything to get in the way of your big night.",
        "Harley: He is the best. He is my husband, so he has to say that.",
        "Dinah: He definitely put you first, and I think that is amazing, but his leg is not looking too good.",
        "Harley: What is up with him and his macho pride thing.",
        "Dinah: I don't know. I don't know. I think men in general really don't like for you to see their weaknesses at all, you know. And you could probably pump Gus up on some pain meds, but he is popping those pills pretty fast.",
        "Harley: What pills? What do you mean.",
        "Dinah: If that's rude the way I said it, I think he is simply self-medicating. And I know and you know where that can lead. Look as a friend, I just want you to know that... well, you should be aware. You should be aware of what is going on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: I was just cleaning up in back.",
        "Tammy: The bar is closed, but it's open for Lizzie?",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie doesn't have a restraining order against me.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. Thanks for inviting me over, but I'm going to go. Is that the trash? I can take it.",
        "Tammy: Since when does Lizzie Spaulding take out the garbage?",
        "Lizzie: Since I am trying to make a new friend. See you around, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: What are you doing here, Tammy? The cops come in here, I get hauled off to jail again.",
        "Tammy: No one knows I'm here. It's just us... us and Lizzie, anyway.",
        "Jonathan: I don't know what Lizzie said to you.",
        "Tammy: She didn't have to say thing. I can tell what is going on between you two.",

        "Coop: You want to give it a shot?",
        "Ava: Sure.",
        "Coop: All right, take that. Now, first things first. It's all about the motion, okay?",
        "Ava: Okay.",
        "Coop: Take that in there, and hold it there, and now, you go too fast, and it's not going to work. But you go too slow, and you're going to run out of time with it. So everything has to be just perfect. Well, um, okay. All right. All right, happy-go-lucky, that's enough. That's enough. We can't paint yet until it dries, so... I don't have to wait here if you don't want.",
        "Ava: Wait. No. No. No. Stay.",
        "Coop: Okay. All right. You know, I've got to say, what's funny about this whole situation is that you and I have been sleeping in two different rooms that are just separated by a thin layer of plaster. It's almost like we've been sleeping together, if you think about it.",
        "Ava: Yeah, actually, now that you mentioned it, what is the point of putting the wall back up?",
        "Coop: We should leave it as it is. Hello.",
        "Ava: Yeah. Wow.",
        "Coop: Ava, about before, the whole milk and book thing. That was not what I was trying to say.",
        "Ava: What were you trying to say?",
        "Coop: Well, I... ah... ( cell phone rings ) Um...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: ( Sighs ) Where are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Dinah, thank you for coming to me about this. Especially with everything that is going on in your life.",
        "Dinah: I'm fine.",
        "Harley: I am going to talk to Gus.",
        "Dinah: Hey, I don't want to start anything.",
        "Harley: You're not starting anything. You're being my friend. Thank you, thank you, especially thinking about me when you're grieving for your father.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, well, I think this Spaulding event has been good for me. It has been getting me through a lot.",
        "Harley: Ross was an amazing guy, and he would be so proud of the work we're doing. Come here, while you're here, look at the speech I'm working on for tomorrow night.",
        "Dinah: Okay. Hmm, I didn't know you were planning to speak at the event.",
        "Harley: Well, I just... a little something to let them know I'm still sitting in the big chair.",
        "Dinah: Right. Well, this looks good.",
        "Harley: Really?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. It's actually kind of inspiring. You should just delivering it like that.",
        "Harley: I'm glad you like it. But I won't be.",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Harley: You will be. I care about this, but not as much as I care about Gus. I promise you, I'll make him think that I'm not going is all my idea, I'll leave you out of it entirely. He knows I'm not into all of the big party stuff.",
        "Dinah: I agree. I don't think anybody needs that. You know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: I can't even explain it.",
        "Gus: I can. You are in love with my brother.",
        "Marina: No, no, I hate him. I hate him! How can I ever forgive him for what he did to Harley? He lied about you. Then again, maybe he was trying to help Harley.",
        "Gus: You're doing it again. You're doing it again.",
        "Marina: What... I am. I am! I'm defending him.",
        "Gus: You are. You are.",
        "Marina: You okay? You tired?",
        "Gus: I'm good, I'm good. I want to dance tomorrow night at the policemen's ball, the foxtrot.",
        "Marina: I was supposed to go with Alan-Michael. How am I supposed to do this? How am I supposed to do this in a town where he could pop up anywhere at anytime?",
        "Gus: You're just going to have to find a way. That's life in Springfield. Try to remember what you learned by being with him. A person who pretends to be your friend while they're sabotaging you behind your back is the most dangerous type of person there is.",
        "Marina: I don't need this. I'm lucky that I ended it before it... I deserve better than this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: All right, Jason, let's rock and roll. Did you get the speech spellchecked for me?",
        "Jason: I'm sorry, I thought Ms. Cooper was... when you left, I thought Mr. Aitoro said...",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I know. They're not showing up at the ball this evening. Corporate changes. That's the way it goes. Okay, thanks. Make some copies. Thank you.",
        "Jason: Okay.",
        "Alan-Michael: Nice job. How'd you swing it?",
        "Dinah: Swing what?",
        "Alan-Michael: Dinah, this is me. What did you do?",
        "Dinah: Nothing, even if I did know what you were talking about.",
        "Alan-Michael: Harley and the ball, spill it.",
        "Dinah: Alan-Michael, you of all people should know that life can turn on a dime at Spaulding.",
        "Alan-Michael: I also know how some people make things twist in the direction they want to go.",
        "Dinah: Really. You must know some pretty interesting people. Arrivederci.",
        "Alan-Michael: Ciao, bella.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: You're the CEO of a multinational company. Do you know that? Do you know that?",
        "Harley: They all say that to me.",
        "Gus: Who is this \"they\" people? \"Mr. And Mrs. They.\" I would like to meet them.",
        "Harley: Sit, sit.",
        "Gus: Why?",
        "Harley: Because I want you to take a load off. Because Dinah is going to be giving the speech in my place tomorrow, and Zach is out playing with R.J., and Rick is dropping Jude off, and I want to spend some time with my guys. I don't want you to move anymore than you think you need to.",
        "Gus: May I ask why?",
        "Harley: I want to spend some time with my guys. More time with my guys, starting tonight.",
        "Gus: What about your big splashy return to Spaulding?",
        "Harley: You know I don't care about all those big parties. Besides, I'm exhausted. I myself am completely exhausted. It's hard building a house and making big grownup decisions and all that stuff, don't you think?",
        "Gus: Yeah. But I have to say this, if you are feeling that the job is going to wipe you out, I think it is a great idea to spend more time with the kids, great.",
        "Harley: That's what I'm saying to you. Pushing yourself too hard is never a good idea, okay? I'm telling you, that's how you end up getting hurt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Coop, if you're not going to come to me, I'm just going to have to come to you. Coop, I...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: I didn't mean to do it. I didn't mean to break it again. I'm not going to feel guilty about this. I'm the biggest klutz in the world, okay. What are you doing?",
        "Coop: Yeah, right. Come here.",
        "Ava: Get over there and fix that thing, the master spackler, whatever you do with that thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Hey, it's Lizzie Spaulding. I need you to dig up everything you can on a girl named Ava Peralta.",

        "Jonathan: The only reason I am where I am is because you drove me here. Frank takes me off to the precinct.",
        "Tammy: I didn't mean for that to happen.",
        "Jonathan: Well, it did happen. What, why are you here anyway?",
        "Tammy: Because I'm tired of running. Jonathan, I don't care what other people think. I don't care what they say or do. All I care about is loving you.",
        "Jonathan: What?",
        "Tammy: I want you back. No, Jonathan, I'm taking you back. I'm pulling you back, whether you want me to or not. Please tell me I didn't totally mess things up. Please.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Reva: It is something. It is something. It is divorce papers, because tomorrow I get to sign away my marriage to Josh in triplicate. Why in the world would you go through with this? Sometimes it just happens.",
        "Jonathan: What is this, some kind of test?",
        "Tammy: I came back for you, Jonathan."
