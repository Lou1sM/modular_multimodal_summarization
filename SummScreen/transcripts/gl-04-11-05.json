I'm so glad you came back.", "Cassie: I didn't come here to kiss and make up. I want to give you these.

I am so furious with you. I don't know how you could have done what you did, but that doesn't really seem to matter because there's a baby in the picture, and that baby is a part of me.", "Edmund: And me.", "Cassie: Maybe i can walk away from you...", "Edmund: Maybe?", "Cassie: But i can't walk away from my own child.", "Edmund: Our child. We made this child together. Now, i'm not going to force you into my way of thinking. I'm not going to force you to love me again, because i know that you still do love me. As the months go by, this miracle is going to bring us closer together, and i know you're going to want it, too.", "Cassie: I want details. I mean, is the baby healthy?", "Edmund: Yes.", "Cassie: And this woman that you've picked to carry our baby. I mean, I don't know anything about her.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dinah: Yes, you do. It's me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tony: Oh, my god, we're running late.", "Michelle: Oh.", "Tony: We've got 30 minutes to get to the courthouse before the hearing starts. You all right? Everything okay?", "Michelle: Yeah.", "Tony: You sure?", "Michelle: What would be wrong?", "Tony: You got no second thoughts about going through with this, divorcing danny?", "Michelle: Tony, i can't wait to get my life started with you.", "Tony: Good.

I'll ust make a quick call to see if we've got enough time, all right?", "Tony: Michelle, you're not going to believe this.

I'm so sorry.", "Marina: We didn't even get to say good-bye. They just put her in handcuffs and dragged her out. It was awful. My poor grandpa. And my dad. I've never seen him like that before.", "Danny: How long have you been sitting here?", "Marina: I just can't bring myself to go home, you know? If i go home, harley won't be there, and then it will all be real, and I don't want it to be real. ( Crying ) danny...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Josh: I'm just saying, whatever happened to, I don't know, time off for good behavior? Harley's a good cop. She's given her best to the city, and it seems like the judge just forgot about that when she sentenced her.", "Reva: You know, as much as i want to believe that life is good and fair, some days that dog won't hunt.", "Josh: I'm sorry about the baby, reva.", "Reva: I'm fine. Really, I'm fine. It's not like we lost one.", "Josh: I know, i just... I know the dream became a bigger thing over the last few days, and that's a whole other kind of loss. I'm just saying I'm sorry about it.", "Reva: Well, you know what? If harley can deal with going to prison, then i can certainly deal with menopause. It's no big deal. It isn't.", "Josh: Why don't you come upstairs with me?", "Reva: Uh, no.", "Josh: No, no, no, no. Just let me give you a back rub or...", "Reva: No. You know what?

Reva.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Give us a minute alone, dinah. Please.", "Dinah: No, edmund. She deserves to know. You should have called her the day after we decided.", "Cassie: What the hell is she talking about?", "Dinah: I am the woman that's carrying your baby, cassie. Call it fate, call it a miracle, call it whatever you want, but i'm about to give you the greatest gift one human being could ever give another.", "Cassie: She's out of her mind.", "Edmund: Cassie, i realize...", "Cassie: No.", "Edmund: I realize this is a shock to you.

I can explain this. Please. It's...", "Cassie: There is... There is no explanation for something like this, unless you can tell me that I'm hallucinating, edmund. Okay, please, just... You can just tell me this isn't true. For god's sake, edmund, if you do anything, you tell me this isn't real, because dinah marler is the last person on earth that i would want carrying my child, and you know that. You know that.", "Edmund: I had no choice.", "Cassie: Oh, my god!", "Dinah: He did it for you, cassie. He wanted you to come back so badly.", "Cassie: So you give my baby... You give my baby to the one person who hates me more than anything in this world?", "Edmund: You were angry at me, and you went away. We were losing our one chance to have the baby we wanted, and i just couldn't let that happen. I couldn't, cassie. I did it for us. I did it because i love you.", "Cassie: If you loved me... If you loved me, this would have never happened, edmund. Who are you? You gave my baby away.", "Edmund: No. Cassie, I didn't. Cassie, listen to me. Please listen to me. You are the reason... You're the reason i wake up in the morning.", "Cassie: Oh, my god.", "Edmund: You are the reason i take my every breath. I wasn't going to lose our chance to have a baby because of one argument, cassie. I just wasn't going to do that. I realize what i did was drastic. And I realize...", "Cassie: Drastic? Drastic? It's insane, edmund. It's unbelievable!", "Dinah: Believe it. This baby is alive, inside of me. Edmund did this because he loves you enough to risk everything.", "Cassie: I'm calling the police.", "Edmund: No, cassie. Cassie, no. No.", "Cassie: Edmund, you stole my baby!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sandy: What are you doing?", "Jonathan: I have to study up for the family construction business.", "Sandy: Josh hasn't hired you. Therefore, this file is confidential.", "Jonathan: Must be a pretty big deal to a little lackey like you, huh?", "Sandy: If josh hires you-- big \"if\"-- you'll be working for me, j-man.", "Jonathan: Not for long, buddy.

You?", "Josh: Not bad.", "Tammy: I'm here with my favorite guy.", "Josh: That's good, because i was actually going to call him, too. Listen, you're being drafted into family service. I'm wondering if the both of you could come over here to the house for just a bit.", "Tammy: Is everything okay?", "Josh: Yes and no. I'll explain when you get here.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: Okay. We'll be right there. Josh needs us to come over to the house. Some sort of family crisis, but not. Do you think we should invite jonathan?", "Sandy: Did josh say he was invited?", "Tammy: I don't think so.", "Sandy: Well, let him make up his own list. I have a feeling something's wrong with reva, and maybe jonathan's part of the problem.", "Tammy: You know what? Yeah, you're right. Let's go. Yeah.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: Hey. I'll have a bourbon. Make it a double.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: Tony, there's been a lot going on, you know? Danny probably postponed it so that we could have some more time to iron out some of the details. You know, you don't want to rush into things when there's a child involved.", "Tony: Yeah, you're right. You're right. You're right. I'm just... I'm a little impatient, that's all.", "Michelle: Me, too.", "Tony: You are, huh?", "Michelle: Yeah. I want to marry you.", "Tony: You do?", "Michelle: Yes.", "Tony: Good. That's good, because i can't wait to make you my wife. All right, i've got to run. I've got some things i've got to take care of. I love you. I'll see you in bit.", "Michelle: Me, too.", "Tony: All right. Phone. I'll see you in a few, babe.", "Michelle: Okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marina: Isn't the final divorce hearing today?", "Danny: I postponed it. I just... There's too much going on. I wanted to be here for you. Hey, nobody's giving up on trying to find a way to clear harley, okay? You just have to try to keep the faith.", "Marina: It's a lot easier to do when you're here. I don't know what I'd do without you.", "Danny: What?", "Marina: Are you sure that there's nothing else i should know about the divorce? Any other reason you postponed? ( Cell phone rings )", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "danny: Hello?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tony: Danny, it's tony. Whatever you're doing, put it down. We need to talk.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marina: Hey.", "Michelle: Hi.", "Marina: Food okay?", "Michelle: Yeah, it was great. It was great. Have you seen danny? I really need to talk to him.", "Marina: Oh. About why he postponed the hearing?", "Michelle: Yeah.", "Marina: He said it just didn't feel like a good time now, with harley being sentenced.", "Michelle: You know, marina, I'm really sorry about that. Your family doesn't deserve that at all.", "Marina: Thank you. That's very nice of you to say. Nice that you remember.", "Michelle: Yeah, it's weird, huh?", "Marina: I missed you, michelle. I hated it when you woke up and you couldn't remember who I was.", "Michelle: Yeah, you know, everyone kept telling me who michelle should be, and I guess i just wt in the other direction, you know? The wrong direction, mostly. I blew it witl a lot of people. You, my brother, my son, my husband.", "Marina: You mean ex-husband, right?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tony: Look, danny, you're not running the show anymore, in case you haven't noticed. You make a change, you let people know.", "Danny: Um, if this is about the postponement of the hearing...", "Tony: Actually, no, it's not.", "Danny: ...That's something for me need to discuss with michelle...", "Tony: It's more that the postponement, okay?", "Danny: ...And not you.", "Tony: Michelle's told me everything, danny. I know what's going on. You've got some talking to do.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jonathan: You keep drinking like that, that kid you're carrying is going to have oatmeal for brains.", "Reva: No kid.", "Jonathan: No kid?", "Reva: No kid.", "Jonathan: Where'd it go?", "Reva: I'm not pregnant.", "Jonathan: Oh. Bummer.", "Reva: Hm.", "Jonathan: Well, you could always try again.", "Reva: No, i can't. You see these women here? Pretty pictures, aren't they? They're all smiling.", "Jonathan: Oh. Wow.", "Reva: Yeah. Wow. I'm going through \"the change.\" Men hit middle age and they get sports cars. Women hit it and they get hot flashes. Where's the justice?", "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) you had a sports car. You looked good in it.", "Reva: Is that why you trashed it?", "Jonathan: It was my time of the month. ( Laughter )", "jonathan: What? Just talk to me about it, okay? Let's get down to this. Hey, well, that's a good thing, right? At least you're not going to have any pms.", "Reva: Oh, yeah. No annoying symptoms at all.", "Jonathan: Hot flashes. ( Laughter ) conditions commonly associated with pms. ( Laughs )", "reva: You are so funny. I can't stand it.", "Jonathan: Changes in sexual desire, extreme... Extreme sweating.", "Reva: Okay, you're not funny at all.", "Jonathan: Oh, my goodness. Limbs decaying and falling off?", "Reva: ( Laughs ) be afraid. Be very afraid.", "Jonathan: Changes in sexual desire and possible...", "Reva: Can i have another drink, please?", "Jonathan: Children leaving home.", "Reva: You are a laugh riot, you know that?", "Jonathan: Hey, look on the bright side.", "Reva: What?", "Jonathan: Senior citizens get great discounts. ( Laughter ) want to go to the movies?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: So, what's the big emergency?", "Josh: Well, here's the thing. Reva thought she was pregnant, and it turns out that she's not. Now, that may not sound earth- shattering, but I think it hurt her, you know, a lot more than she's letting on. Let me take that for you.", "Tammy: I'm sorry. Well, what can we do?", "Josh: Well, i just... Come with me. I'm just glad that you're here, and I want you to hang around for a little while and show reva... You know, remind her of everything that she already has. In fact, i already called marah and shayne and dylan. I'm hoping that they'll come back later, you know? Remind her that she's a mom.", "Sandy: And a great one.", "Josh: Exactly. ( Phone ringing ) that's exactly the point. I'm going to take this in the other room. I'll be right back. Excuse me. Hello? Yeah.", "Tammy: Phew.", "Sandy: What?", "Tammy: I'm just trying not to think about my aunt and uncle... You know. If they think reva was pregnant, that means that they...", "Sandy: Yes, it does.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Cassie. Cassie.", "Cassie: Edmund, give me the phone. I'm calling the police.", "Edmund: Okay, cassie.", "Cassie: Give me the phone.", "Edmund: Cassie, no crime has been committed here. Just look at me.", "Cassie: Get off of me.", "Edmund: Look at me. I love you, cassie. I love you. Now, i realize what I did may have been a little impulsive, maybe extreme, but we can work that out, cassie. There's a baby. There's a baby coming. My god, cassie, the baby's already here.", "Dinah: We didn't do this to hurt you.", "Edmund: Oh, my god, cassie, no. Just the opposite. It's a baby, cassie. Come on, it's our baby.", "Cassie: Okay, so you... You plotted with my husband to take my baby away?", "Edmund: No. Cassie, no, no, no, no, no, no. The nurses thought dinah was you. Cassie, the embryos were about to be frozen. I mean, what if something had gone wrong? We would have lost our chance to have a baby, all because of one argument.", "Cassie: It wasn't one argument. I left you, edmund, because you started the fire in the barn that almost killed me and my son.", "Cassie: Don't.", "Dinah: Haven't you made mistakes in your life?", "Cassie: Shut up! I don't want to hear anything from you.", "Dinah: I want you to stop looking at the negative in this. Please. I have your baby in here. Doesn't that make you just a little bit happy?", "Cassie: ( Whimpers )", "dinah: That the baby is alive and well inside of me.", "Cassie: Why did you do this? Tell me. Tell me why. Why did you do this?", "Dinah: Because it was the right thing to do.", "Edmund: Dinah, why don't you go upstairs?", "Cassie: No, i want to hear what else she has to say.", "Edmund: What she has to say doesn't matter, cassie. This is about you and me and our future.", "Dinah: I am just the gestational carrier.", "Edmund: Dinah, please.", "Dinah: I went into this knowing that in the end I would surrender the baby that I was carrying.", "Cassie: Stop, stop, stop, stop, because I feel like I have just walked into the twilight zone. I was gone a week. One week, edmund. And now my baby, my baby, it's in there? Oh, my god.", "Dinah: Please stop sounding so ungrateful. There was no guarantee with your medical problems that you could ever carry a baby to term.", "Edmund: Dinah, that's enough.", "Dinah: I am sacrificing nine months of my life, and do I hear a thank you? No. Talk about ungrateful.", "Edmund: Dinah, I said that's... Dinah.", "Cassie: No. You stay away from her. Coming up on \"guiding light\"...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Josh: Reva.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: No, i'll be back.", "Tammy: Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.", "Reva: I can't deal with this. ( Screams )", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "dinah: I want you to feel this. This baby is getting bigger by the moment. A child is going to be born. Your child.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: It's my child.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: Tony, michelle and i have many issues to resolve that don't involve you.", "Tony: Danny, anything that involves michelle involves me, all right? If this is about the memories, i know all about that. She's told me everything. \"Memories\"-- the key word. The past. What's happened back then, it's completely irrelevant, danny. All right, now we're getting married, okay? As soon as this divorce hearing is final. Can you make that happen? Can you do that?", "Danny: I'm moving on.", "Tony: You are. Well, I'm not so sure, danny. Really, I'm not. Because, i mean, when you found out that michelle was in trouble, you flew right down to santo domingo.", "Danny: Because she's robbie mother and i will always care for her.", "Tony: She's moved on, okay? Don't come around playing the memory card. It's not what she wants.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: Yes, you are right. Danny will be my ex-husband.", "Marina: Sorry, just checking.", "Michelle: You really like him a lot, don't you?", "Marina: Danny's been really great to me the last couple of months, with harley's trial and everything.", "Michelle: Yeah, he's a good guy.", "Marina: I can't imagine letting anything get in the way.", "Michelle: Including me, you mean?", "Marina: You've been gone a long time.", "Michelle: Yeah, i know. I know. And you know, you should know that tony and I are getting married. Nothing has changed.", "Marina: Well, good. Great. I mean, I... I just don't want this to be ugly.", "Michelle: Me neither. Me neither. Been there, hated that.", "Marina: We used to be really good friends. That's why i want to be totally up front with you. I guess I'm falling in love with him.", "Michelle: Have you told danny that?", "Marina: Not yet.", "Michelle: Well, i'm happy for you, really. Both of you.", "Marina: Good. It's about time something good happened, right? I mean, you have tony and I have danny. I don't know, maybe we could all double-date some time. Maybe not.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: So aunt reva's really upset about the whole baby thing, huh?", "Josh: Well, actually, it's a little more complicated than just the baby, but for now i'd just like to leave it at that.", "Tammy: That's fine by me.", "Sandy: Sure. You got it.", "Josh: Listen, thank you again, both of you, for being here. I really do appreciate it. I just think she needs family around her right now.", "Sandy: Yeah. It's too bad marah and shayne can't be home.", "Josh: Yeah, well, like i said, I called them. Hopefully they'll call back later.", "Tammy: What about jonathan?", "Josh: Jonathan? Yes, i thought about jonathan, and then i thought to myself, no, reva needs support and encouragement right now. She doesn't need jonathan.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jonathan: Hey, for what it's worth, i'm sorry that you didn't get to have that baby, because it would have been pretty cool to have a little mini-me running around. Well, we could always adopt.", "Reva: \"We?\"", "Jonathan: You. I was just laying out the options. So what now?", "Reva: Now i buy a fan for the hot flashes, and try not to kill anybody.", "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) no, I meant, what are you going to do now?", "Reva: Now? Now now, i should probably go home to my man, who still loves me as much as he did the day he married me.", "Jonathan: I don't know if it's appropriate to say to your mom, but i think you're still pretty hot, for an old chick. ( Laughs ) that was a compliment.", "Reva: Yeah. Yeah, great. I'll take it. What was that for?", "Jonathan: I don't know.", "Reva: Right. I'll see you later.", "Jonathan: Don't wear out the rocking chairs.", "Reva: I guess you're still my baby.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Cassie, i know you're worried about dinah and the baby, but she signed a contract. The baby is ours legally. As soon as it's born, she has no rights to it. I made sure of that.", "Dinah: I'm just the incubator.", "Cassie: Edmund? Is there any... Is there any way we can make a transfer? Can we get it back? Please?", "Edmund: Cassie, i saw an opportunity and I took it.", "Cassie: So, what did you think? Any old uterus would do?", "Dinah: Excuse me, but i am not just \"any old uterus.\" It's functioning perfectly fine, for you.", "Cassie: Edmund, did it occur to you that I might not want a baby this way? That i might say no? That i might not want my own flesh and blood put into the one person who lives to make me miserable? Did you think just maybe that this might hurt me?", "Edmund: Cassie, my only thought was to give you what you wanted. Cassie, when you left... When you left i was terrified i'd never be able to get you back again. I just wanted to show you how much i loved you. I wanted to try to make up for a few of the mistakes in my life. There was a window, cassie, a window of opportunity, and i grabbed it. Now, maybe i grabbed the wrong person, but I didn't have much of a choice. Cassie, I was fighting for us.", "Cassie: You were trying to control me, edmund. You knew that if there was a baby, that we would be connected for the rest of our lives. So you took something that was beautiful, that we made together, and you used it for your own selfish reasons, and there isn't a word for that.", "Dinah: Yes there is. It's called love-- unconditional love. He saved your baby.", "Cassie: I am talking to the walls, here. Oh, my god.", "Dinah: Come here. Come here. Come here. Give me your hand.", "Cassie: Get off.", "Dinah: Give me your hand. I want you to feel this! This baby is getting bigger by the moment, and it may have edmund's smile or your eyes, or the other way around, or it may look just like tammy. And you may hate me, but it doesn't change the fact that a child is going to be born. Your child.", "Cassie: It's my child.", "Edmund: Cassie, we're going to have a baby. A little boy or a little girl to raise together. To love together.", "Cassie: I feel like i'm in a nightmare. Your lips are moving, but i cannot hear anything you're saying.", "Edmund: The only thing you have to understand, cassie, is that i love you. I love you, and you can forget about everything else.", "Dinah: Edmund had his reservations because of our past, but he overlooked them because of his love for you.", "Cassie: What do you get out of this?", "Dinah: Let's just say i owe you one.", "Edmund: Cassie? We're going to have everything we want. All we have to do is hold on. Nine months. No, not even nine months, cassie. Don't give up on our dream. Don't give up on us. Please?

( Cell phone ringing )", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "josh: Everything okay in here?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: Great.", "Sandy: Couldn't be better.", "Tammy: Surprise.", "Sandy: Oh, hey.", "Reva: Surprise. Did I forget somebody's birthday?", "Sandy: No, it's an \"in case you didn't know it, we love revaparty.", "Tammy: How are you feeling? Are you okay?", "Sandy: Hm?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: Excuse me just a second. You told them?", "Josh: Well, i just... I told them about the baby, that's all. I just figured you needed to have family around you right now, so actually i called everybody, but these are the only two that I reached.", "Reva: I wish you would have asked me.", "Josh: I guess i should have, but I wanted you to see how full your life is without having another child.", "Reva: That was very thoughtful of you.\u00f1 Excuse me.", "Josh: Reva. Reva.", "Reva: No, i'll be back. I'll be back.", "Tammy: Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.", "Reva: I can't deal with this. I can't deal with this. ( Screams )", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "marina: Hi. What are you doing here?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: Well, I just wanted to make sure you're doing okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marina: Well, i am now.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: Good, good. I changed the oil in my car. I'm just going to wash off and i'll be right back.", "Michelle: Hey. So, you postponed the divorce hearing.", "Danny: Yeah. I mean, I was going to call you, but...", "Michelle: Why?", "Danny: Why? Well, because there was a lot going on today, with harley being sentenced, and...", "Michelle: No.", "Danny: No, what?", "Michelle: This is me, danny. I want to know the truth.", "Danny: Michelle, come on. I mean, since that little incident...", "Michelle: Which wasn't so little. When my memories came back.", "Danny: Right, and we haven't talked about anything. We haven't talked about the hearing, and i just thought it would be better to postpone it until we could talk.", "Michelle: So, did you set a new date?", "Danny: No. I didn't.", "Michelle: That's what i thought.", "Danny: Michelle, you didn't just get your memory back. All right? That changed things. Or at least for me it did. What? Did it not for you?", "Michelle: Yes, it did.", "Danny: Okay, well i just figured we had some stuff to work out. If you don't, then yeah, we should just go ahead and schedule the hearing and move forward.", "Michelle: No. No, no, no, no. I think it's probably a good idea for us to work out some...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tony: Hey, danny. Listen, I saw marina outside. She was a little worried about you, wondering what had happened to you.", "Danny: So, we'll talk later.", "Michelle: Right.", "Tony: Did you give him hell for canceling?", "Michelle: I bet you did.", "Tony: Look, he's messing with us, okay? I just wanted to know what the deal was, that's all.", "Michelle: And?", "Tony: And he apologized for not telling us.", "Michelle: And you two didn't get into it?", "Tony: What is there to get into? I mean, hey, he seems really, really into marina, you know.", "Michelle: Well, good. That's good.", "Tony: It is good. They're cute together. I mean, you know... Listen, I'm going to get some coffee. You want anything?", "Michelle: No.", "Tony: You sure?", "Michelle: Mm-hmm.", "Tony: All right. Well, you all set? You want to go home and pretend we're in the jungle and look for spider bites?

Let's go home.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Josh: You okay?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gueva: No. Not really.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Josh: Reva, look, if you're set on having another child...", "Reva: It's not the baby.", "Josh: Okay, i guess it's the other thing, then.", "Reva: No. I mean, it is. I knew that this was going to happen sooner or later. I was just kind of thinking that later would be better.", "Josh: You...
