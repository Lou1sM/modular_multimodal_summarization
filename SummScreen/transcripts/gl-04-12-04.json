        "jeffrey: The feds are going to prosecute, danny. They're going to come down on you like a ton of bricks. And I'm going to make sure of it. Your friend cassie winslow, your campaign manager, bill lewis...",
        "Danny: They...",
        "Jeffrey: Your cousin tony. Anybody and everybody that's invested faith and/or money into danny santos is going to be crushed.",
        "Danny: O'neill, not one of them has done anything.",
        "Jeffrey: Danny, it's guilt by association. That's the law. How many times have I got to tell you? I didn't write it",
        "danny: Damn you, o'neill. Damn you. (Phone rings)",
        "marah: Aren't you going to answer that?",
        "Jeffrey: Remember in the old days? There were no cell phones.",
        "Marah: You're dating yourself.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you know what? Curiously, i have no humiliation doing that anymore. Because I have no shame, after all.",
        "Marah: Hmm. Is this your effort to try and cheer me up?",
        "Jeffrey: Is it working?",
        "Marah: I'm smiling.",
        "Jeffrey: Come on.",
        "Cassie: That man is such a manipulator. First, he backs danny, he supports the campaign. Now he's investigating him. Talk about dredging up your own press. Look, I know... I know danny did not do the things that he said he did. And if marah wasn't with him, I'd go up there right now and i'd tell him so.",
        "Edmund: Unbelievable.",
        "Cassie: I know. Unbelievable.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, what is it? Is it his face? Is that it? Is that what keeps you running after jeffrey o'neill?",
        "Marah: Somebody really wants to get a hold of you.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I'm a very important man, don't you know?",
        "Marah: You are to me.",
        "Jeffrey: Come on, i want you to rest. Here we go.",
        "Marah: Do you have an extra shirt I can wear?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah.",
        "Marah: Thank you.",
        "Marah: I like it when you don't resist me.",
        "Jeffrey: That's getting harder and harder to do.",
        "Marah: See, you can still do what you do and be who you are and have me.",
        "Danny: Hey, i'm sorry i took so long.",
        "Michelle: Where have you been?",
        "Danny: I just needed to go for a little drive.",
        "Michelle: Mm-hmm.",
        "Danny: We need to talk.",
        "Michelle: Okay. Come on.",
        "Danny: Can we sit down?",
        "Michelle: Yeah.",
        "Everyone: Surprise! (Cheers and applause)",
        "Cassie: You know what? I am not chasing after him, you know. You, you are the one who has a problem with jeffrey o'neill.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, i don't like the man. I don't like the way he uses women. I don't like the way he uses the power of his office. I don't like his clothes.",
        "Cassie: Oh, come on.",
        "Jeffrey: I don't like the fact that he seems to be your favorite topic of conversation.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Ha ha. See. See. You have a problem with jeffrey o'neill. Not me. You. You don't like the way i deal with him.",
        "Edmund: And, cassie, for once i think just about everyone in this town would agree with me.",
        "Cassie: You're crazy.",
        "Edmund: You told michelle earlier this evening that you had a way of dealing with jeffrey o'neill. Just what is that way?",
        "Cassie: You're jealous.",
        "Edmund: Jealous?",
        "Cassie: Yes.",
        "Edmund: I don't know. Worried? Suspicious? Mistrustful? You betcha. Cassie... Cassie, you have no idea how much energy you put into the man.",
        "Cassie: Would you just stop?",
        "Edmund: You have something for jeffrey o'neill. I'm not saying it's romantic. I'm not even saying it's sexual.",
        "Cassie: Oh.",
        "Edmund: But i'd be surprised if it's not at least in part. But you two have an annoying way of showing up at the same place at the same time.",
        "Cassie: He's staying here in my hotel, edmund!",
        "Edmund: Dinner with him at reva's. You soaked to the bone in about the sexiest thing I'd ever seen, and him half naked in a towel. You have no idea about the man's past...",
        "Cassie: Well, you do. Because you've had him investigated.",
        "Edmund: You're damn right i had him investigated. Who could possibly blame me? The man, a dead ringer for richard, shows up in town, checks into your hotel, starts conducting mysterious business right under our noses. Cassie, of course I'd have him investigated. I'd be an idiot if i hadn'T.",
        "Cassie: He's nothing like richard, okay? And you know what? What do really know about anyone, huh, edmund? Because if someone started looking into your past and everything that you've done... Well.",
        "Edmund: Cassie... Cassie, just because you accepted me, just because you accepted me in spite of my past, doesn't mean you can extend that courtesy to everyone else.",
        "Cassie: Why not?",
        "Edmund: Because you don't know who the man is. And that fact could cost you.",
        "Marah: Aren't you going to get in with me?",
        "Jeffrey: If i did, I don't think either one of us would get much rest.",
        "Marah: What if I promise just to cuddle?",
        "Jeffrey: I'm not talking about what you'd be doing. Come on, slide in.",
        "Marah: Remind me to tell aunt cassie that I love the sheets they use.",
        "Jeffrey: I don't think that she would want to hear about what you think of the sheets on my bed. Hey.",
        "Marah: What is wrong with me?",
        "Jeffrey: It's okay. You're suffering from post- traumatic stress syndrome. It's normal for someone who has gone through a trauma like you. In your case, it's because you shot carrie. You think that you killed her.",
        "Marah: I just keep seeing myself with the gun, and i can't make it stop.",
        "Jeffrey: Shh. I'm going to help you, okay? Right now I just want you to try and sleep. Just close your eyes and forget about everything. In a peaceful, dreamless sleep.",
        "Marah: Can you promise me that when I wake up, everything will be different?",
        "Jeffrey: What do you want to be different?",
        "Marah: It would be like everything that happened before this moment never happened at all. Except for new year's eve and valentine day, mom and dad being back together, and shayne walking again.",
        "Jeffrey: I think I'd better take notes.",
        "Marah: No. It's really pretty simple. I just don't want the life that i have now. Except for you. I just want to be back to the life that I had before i ever met carrie. Before...",
        "Jeffrey: Shhh. Hey, one of the hardest things for you is going to be to accept what happened, accept what you did. But you have to remember one thing, one very important thing: Marah, everything you did, you did because you wanted to save your father.",
        "Marah: I still shot somebody. Jeffrey, do you think I have it in me to seriously hurt people?",
        "Jeffrey: Come on. You know what? Nothing like that night is ever, ever going to happen again, okay?",
        "Marah: Maybe I should play it safe and just wish for that instead.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I think... I think I can arrange that.",
        "Marah: All right. Then we'll make it so. From this point on, until further notice, you will save me from any harm.",
        "Jeffrey: I'll do my best.",
        "Danny: Wow, did you do this?",
        "Michelle: I wish that i could take credit for it, but it was nico's idea, this party.",
        "Nico: Oh, come on, michelle. We all worked hard for this and we won. We had to do this for danny. And you know what? Everything paid off, especially when we saw your face next to that big red checkmark.",
        "Michelle: Yeah.",
        "Nico: You deserve more than another party, man. You deserve a parade on fifth street.",
        "Danny: (Laughs) no, I don't need a parade.",
        "Nico: I just didn't have the time to pull one together.",
        "Danny: Well, this is great. Are you kidding? This is fantastic. I really appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you.",
        "Nico: The party at the beacon was okay.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, but jeffrey hogged you the whole time.",
        "Danny: Yes.",
        "Tony: Yeah, what's his... What's his story anyway?",
        "Danny: Oh, he wanted to tell me privately about the recount.",
        "Rick: Did he happen to mention why?",
        "Ed: Yeah, did ross request that or what?",
        "Danny: No. As far as I know, ross heard about it at the same time as everybody else. And as far as why, i don't know. I guess it's just something to be expected when somebody like me is in politics. And... I mean, really it's not... It's not that unusual, especially when the votes are this close.",
        "Nico: Who cares about some whacked recount? We were onboard the danny express from the beginning, and we're staying on it till we get to the mayor's mansion. (Laughter)",
        "danny: All right. Well, thank you. Look at you. I mean, you... No one would ever know you just had a baby.",
        "Mel: Thank you.",
        "Danny: Hello, beautiful one. She's just gorgeous.",
        "Ed: Yeah, just like her mommy.",
        "Michelle: But they can't get this name thing straight, though.",
        "Mel: Yes, i know.",
        "Danny: Yeah, what's up with that?",
        "Mel: As of yet our baby has no name. But we will be honored if she was the first baby kissed by the new mayor.",
        "Rick: Oh, there you go.",
        "Danny: It would be an honor. I hope i don't... I hope i don't scare her.",
        "Mel: (Laughs) no.",
        "All: Oh!",
        "Rick: I'm so proud of you. I mean, this an amazing accomplishment. I got some parking tickets across at the hospital. (Laughter)",
        "michelle: Oh, you. It was only a matter of time.",
        "Danny: How long was it going to take?",
        "Ed: Are you going to stop whining about one parking ticket?",
        "Danny: It's the same day.",
        "Rick: No, it's not. It's ten parking tickets.",
        "Tony: Can you believe this? What do you say? Danny santos, mayor. Huh? We actually did it.",
        "Father ray: I'm proud, T. Just like you are.",
        "Tony: Yeah, i am.",
        "Ray: How do you think he's doing?",
        "Tony: Well, you know, i mean he's... He's stressed out. Worried about the recount.",
        "Father ray: Is that all?",
        "Tony: Well, i mean, what's up? You know something?",
        "Father ray: He was at church earlier. With jeffrey o'neill.",
        "Tony: Really? What's that about?",
        "Father ray: I'm not sure. He stayed after o'neill left. He was angry... Sad, disappointed. He said my prayers were wasted on him.",
        "Tony: Really? All of that for A... For a recount, huh? I would think that he'd be... That he'd be in fight mode.",
        "Father ray: Yeah, me, too. But he wasn'T. Reminds me of...",
        "Tony: Of what?",
        "Father ray: The old days.",
        "Ed: It's no secret that i had doubts about you running for office. But, like my children, you ignored me and you went out and did what you thought was right anyway, and it turned out you were right. So i am really proud to call myself your father-in-law, but even prouder to call you mr. Mayor.",
        "Danny: Well, thank you. But really, the truth is you showed me. You did. How to... You did. How to overcome your past and do great things. You've been a great example for me. So thank you.",
        "Edmund: All right, so as your first act as mayor...",
        "Danny: Yes.",
        "Ed: ...Would you please name my grandchild? Since lord knows her parents aren't ever going to get around to it.",
        "Danny: I don't know if I can do it.",
        "Mel: We haven't had any brilliant suggestions from you.",
        "Rick: That's exactly right.",
        "Ed: Sophia. Sophia. What's wrong with that? Sophia.",
        "Danny: I like sophia.",
        "Rick: Sophia is nice. Sophia is great. Francesca. Frankie.",
        "Mel: Oh, that's cute.",
        "Ed: Frankie. I don't know about frankie.",
        "Michelle: What were you thinking, rick?",
        "Rick: Well, i was thinking more along the lines of anna.",
        "Michelle: Okay, but anna's a little boring. I like ivy.",
        "Rick: Ivy. Ivy's a great name for a potted plant. Anybody else?",
        "Danny: Ivy is neat. I like ivy. Isabella is nice. (Everyone talking)",
        "nico: Blanca. Blanca. Rosa. Rosa.",
        "Danny alter ego: I know what you want.",
        "Danny: I can't have it, can i?",
        "Danny alter ego: Nope. After carmen was out of the picture, you could have had everything you wanted.",
        "Danny: Then what happened? How did I screw it up?",
        "Danny alter ego: You know how.",
        "Danny: Let's hear your take on it.",
        "Danny alter ego: Interesting story actually. Full of simple truths. Truths that bring down bigger criminals than you.",
        "Danny: What? Nobody's called me a criminal in a very long time.",
        "Danny alter ego: Because you stopped thinking of yoseself as one. You reinvented yourself. You became such a brilliant liar that you started believing the lies yourself. It's common actually. Guys pull off bigger and bigger cons till they think they're untouchable.",
        "Danny: I was. I was invincible.",
        "Danny alter ego: These people here, these people you love, they won't stand by you when they find out you're dirty. They're going to be crushed and angry.",
        "Danny: Especially michelle.",
        "Danny alter ego: You lied to her. She's never going to trust you again.",
        "Danny: I want to protect them from this.",
        "Danny alter ego: Then the only thing for you to do is go back into the mob. Help o'neill bring down salerno. Danny, you've got to accept who you are. You're not a bauer. You're definitely not a mayor.",
        "Danny: I am what I've always been.",
        "Danny alter ego: And you always will be.",
        "Tony: Hey. What's up? Where are you?",
        "Jeffrey: I have to give her up. I have to give her up.",
        "Tony: May i?",
        "Danny: Scotch?",
        "Tony: Yeah, please. Thank you. You know, I never cared about becoming successful the right way. I just always assumed if you win, you win. Despite how you got there, you know.",
        "Danny: Yeah. But it does matter how you get there.",
        "Tony: Danny. Danny... Danny, you won this election on your own. You won it by the book. I mean, come on. That says something, right? Don't you think? Because I do.",
        "Danny: Yeah, I guess so.",
        "Tony: Right?",
        "Danny: You never thought I'd get out of the life.",
        "Tony: (Laughs) all right, i knew that you wanted to, yeah. But no, I never thought it was possible.",
        "Danny: I can't say I blame you.",
        "Tony: You know, for all that it matters, danny, i watched salerno jump on your back and watched him... Like there was a bulls-eye in the middle of your back, you know what I mean? People wanted to take a stab at you; they wanted to come after you. You never let anyone take you down, you know.",
        "Danny: Tony, I still got a bulls-eye on my back and it's bigger than ever.",
        "Tony: Then let me handle that. Let me take care of it, danny. Okay?",
        "Danny: No. I don't want you to.",
        "Tony: What do you mean you don't want me to?",
        "Danny: I don'T...",
        "Tony: This is supposed to be... Come on, man, this is supposed be the best night of your life.",
        "Danny: Yeah?",
        "Tony: It's not. Right? It's not. I want you... I want you to go back in there. I want you to relax, have a good time. This is your night.",
        "Danny: I wish i could. Believe me. I wish i could.",
        "Tony: You wish... You didn't hear a thing that dr. Bauer said, did you? Huh? You inspire people, danny. That's what he said. You inspire people. You do.",
        "Danny: Well, then, tony, that either makes me a real hero or it makes everybody else real stupid.",
        "Ed: She's got your eyes.",
        "Rick: Yeah. Yes, you do.",
        "Ed: You know, i'm holding her here in my arms, and i'm just overwhelmed with the sheer volume of the things i never did for you and michelle. But, you know... (Baby crying) come on, sweetheart. You want this? Come on.",
        "Rick: The paci there, that'll do it.",
        "Ed: You want this? But you know the other side of that coin is that when i left her in your hands, when she still needed a father, you stepped up. You took care of her. You did everything for her, rick. You did.",
        "Rick: Well, dad, you did what you felt was the best at the time.",
        "Ed: Yeah, what I think is the best at the time is never good enough. But looking at you... Looking at you, i see the definition of hope. Yes, i do.",
        "Rick: We thought we lost you there for a while, dad. We're just thankful to have you home.",
        "Ed: An old dog always finds his way home as long as he's got a home.",
        "Rick: Well...",
        "Ed: Hello, darling.",
        "Rick: You're family, dad. You'll always have a home.",
        "Danny: Hey, i want you to promise me something. And you're probably going to have all kinds of questions, but i just... I want you to say yes and then we'll be done with it. Okay? Can you do that for me?",
        "Tony: Yeah. Yeah, I can.",
        "Danny: All right. Okay. Look, I don't know what this recount is going to bring, but if, and I don't know what... But if something should ever happen to me...",
        "Tony: Whoa, whoa. Wait...",
        "Danny: We've never had this talk. If something should ever happen to me, i just want to make sure that you're going to take care of michelle and robbie.",
        "Tony: What are you talking about, danny?",
        "Danny: I want to make sure that robbie is raised to be... Teach him what it is to be a man. Make sure that he's, you know, he's provided for and he stays on the straight path. Ray will help. But I really... Listen to me. I want you to be the man that robbie looks up to. That robbie looks up to.",
        "Tony: And michelle? What? Do i get to sleep with her, too? Danny, what is this? I get your kid, I get your wife. Come on. I mean, is that what you're offering here? I get your house, too?",
        "Danny: No.",
        "Tony: What are you... I don't get this.",
        "Danny: No, it's not what I'm offering.",
        "Tony: Well, then, what the hell is wrong with you?",
        "Cassie: You are blowing this totally out of proportion, edmund.",
        "Edmund: The man gets under your skin, cassie. And that fact gets under mine.",
        "Cassie: The man? (Laughs) the man. Jeffrey o'neill does not get under my skin, okay? So, do you think i should talk to him about danny?",
        "Edmund: Well, you're the one who's supposed to have a way with the man, so... (Cell phone rings)",
        "jeffrey: Yeah. Yeah, I did it. It's all up to danny santos now. If i press him any harder, the guy's going to crack. My judgement is just fine, thank you very much. You'll get your answer when i get it. What's that? Is \"cocktail waitress\" part of job description now?",
        "Cassie: Sometimes.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, thanks. I need it.",
        "Cassie: So, don't you think it's time we talk about danny santos?",
        "Jeffrey: Why do you keep pestering me?",
        "Cassie: Because you keep making an ass out of yourself.",
        "Jeffrey: Thanks.",
        "Cassie: Danny ran this election fair and square. The votes he got he got because he worked hard and because he was committed.",
        "Jeffrey: Fine. Then he's got nothing to worry about, does he?",
        "Cassie: Well, no, he shouldn't have anything to worry about, but the rumors are flying. Danny made people believe in him, jeffrey. Now, look, i know you have a job to do, and that's fine. I just hope you get it done. I hope you get it done fast. Because if you draw out some long investigation, I don't think this town is going to recover from it.",
        "Jeffrey: What could possibly something I care about?",
        "Tony: You want to tell me why the hell you're thinking this way? Seriously. This is probably why i'm not saying yes to anything.",
        "Danny: I'm sorry. You don't have a choice.",
        "Tony: I don't have a choice?",
        "Danny: Not with this one.",
        "Tony: I don't have a choice, right?",
        "Danny: No.",
        "Tony: So what? You ask me to be polite? What's going on, danny?",
        "Danny: Tony, all I'm saying is you are the closest thing that i have to a brother, and i want to know that you will always do right by my boy. That's it.",
        "Tony: You don't have to ask me for that. You know that.",
        "Danny: Okay. All right then. Good. Thank you.",
        "Tony: You're not going to tell me, are you? Huh?",
        "Danny: There's nothing to tell.",
        "Tony: There's nothing to tell. There's nothing to tell.",
        "Danny: Look, tony, you and i... Look at me. You and I both know that i've made some mistakes.",
        "Tony: Everyone has, danny. What the hell is going on?",
        "Danny: Right. That's all. Just remember that my family... I love my family and that includes you. My family means everything to me, okay? I've got to get some more of this.",
        "Mel: I think I'm going to take my time going back to work, you know? The hospital is staffed on the floor, and with my law degree, i was thinking about something in administration.",
        "Ed: What? I don't believe what i'm hearing. You'd rather push papers than practice?",
        "Mel: Ed, law is practice, too.",
        "Ed: Well...",
        "Mel: Come on, with all this malpractice going on, you need someone like me to watch your back.",
        "Ed: (Laughs)",
        "rick: Hey, dad, you're not back on rotation yet. When can we expect you to be on call?",
        "Michelle: Yeah. I think it's time, you know. Patients need you, the hospital wants you back.",
        "Ed: I don't see you running back to pick up any spare shifts. Come on.",
        "Michelle: I've been working there. And I've been very busy.",
        "Ed: Oh, come on, why don't you take a leap of faith? Go back into it.",
        "Nico: You know what? Michelle got the ball rolling, but in the end, danny saved my life, man. You remember where i was a year ago.",
        "Father ray: On the streets, stealing purses.",
        "Nico: Exactly. Look, father, danny took me in and he gave me a second chance. He didn't ask anything in return. There's nothing I wouldn't do for that guy. I mean, nothing.",
        "Michelle: Hey, you.",
        "Danny: Hey, you.",
        "Michelle: Are you thinking about the recount?",
        "Danny: No. I just... Who cares? I don't even know if i want the stupid job anymore. I'm serious. Honey, i mean it. I mean, let's face facts. Win or lose, in the end, in the eyes of this town, i am tainted.",
        "Michelle: Okay, well, if you win, and you're going to win...",
        "Danny: Well...",
        "Michelle: You're going to be the mayor. And nobody is going to care much when they see you cut unemployment in half, you know.",
        "Danny: But obviously, when people like me try to do things...",
        "Michelle: What does that mean: \"When people like me\"?",
        "Danny: People like me...",
        "Michelle: What does that mean?",
        "Danny: When people like me try to do things like this, they get smacked down. I should know better. I mean, trying to run for mayor. That's when a guy like me is going to get slapped.",
        "Michelle: Danny.",
        "Danny: Hmm? What?",
        "Michelle: Earlier tonight when we were at the beacon lying in each other arms, we talked about this.",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Michelle: No matter what, you ran a good campaign.",
        "Danny: Right.",
        "Michelle: And that's why I'm so proud of you.",
        "Danny: Yeah. But maybe we were fooling ourselves.",
        "Michelle: This recount is just a formality. Everyone knows you won. You won.",
        "Danny: But look at what i won. Look at what i got. Everyone's whispering about how i won, if I won...",
        "Michelle: Well, who cares? Let them whisper.",
        "Danny: You know what's really funny? I probably wouldn't be dealing with any of this if I just took salerno's money and bought that damn election.",
        "Michelle: What are you saying? You'd be better off if you'd lied and cheated your way into office?",
        "Danny: Michelle, you and i both know I've never been squeaky clean. And maybe just this whole campaign, moving on away from my past is a joke. I mean, really, this whole town knows who I am, what i am.",
        "Michelle: Well, i thought we both knew who you were.",
        "Danny: Maybe we were wrong.",
        "Ed: Oh, sweetie pie, it's a good thing you didn't decide to come into world early, you know, because grandpa wasn't feeling too good. But I look at you are now and i know how lucky i am. I don't deserve all the blessings I've got, but I got them anyway. And I'll probably not make the wisest decisions in the future, but one thing I can promise you, I will always love you. Always. My sweetie.",
        "Michelle: I don't know where this is coming from. Danny?",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Michelle: I mean, it's been a long day, you're tired. Maybe you've been drinking too much.",
        "Danny: Okay, you're right. I'm just... I am really tired. I'm frustrated. I'm mad as hell about this whole thing.",
        "Michelle: You're just being so negative, you know?",
        "Danny: I know.",
        "Michelle: It's not like you.",
        "Danny: Okay. You're right. It's nothing. Okay.",
        "Michelle: Hey, whoa, whoa. Hey, don't walk away. I mean, I think I deserve to know what this is really about.",
        "Danny: Honey, no. You're right. It's nothing. It's absolutely nothing. Maybe this whole thing wasn't meant to be.",
        "Michelle: What?",
        "Danny: Really.",
        "Michelle: Why are you going to give up so easily?",
        "Danny: I'm not.",
        "Michelle: You won, danny. You've got a lot of people out there counting on you. I'm counting on you. Talk to me. If there's something going on, you know that you can tell me anything. You can trust me.",
        "Cassie: I know you care. I've seen a kind side of you. Like when you're with marah. I've seen a man deeply committed to getting drugs off the streets. I've seen a man who pretends he doesn't like children, but, wow, he seems to be so great with them anyway. I don't know who you work for. And I don't know why you're in this town. I don't even know who you are.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm everything you said i am, okay? I'm all things to all people. How's that?",
        "Cassie: I think you want to help danny, and I think you want to do the right thing.",

        "Edmund: Well?",
        "Cassie: Ah. It didn't go so well.",
        "Edmund: Surprise, surprise.",
        "Cassie: I don't think he wants to hurt danny. I don't know what to think.",
        "Edmund: Here's an idea. Let's stop thinking about jeffrey o'neill altogether.",
        "Sandy: Looks a little tense over there.",
        "Shayne: You know what? I'm not the biggest fan of edmund, but it's got to be kind of annoying for him having this richard lookalike running around town, you know?",

        "Shayne: Yeah.",
        "Marina: I feel bad for him.",

        "Jeffrey: There's so much i wish i could tell you. I want to share everything with you. You deserve that. You deserve all of me. But I can't give that to you, not as long as they have me doing the work that I have to do. I haven't had someone like you in my life in so long.
