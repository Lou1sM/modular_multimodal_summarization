        "Josh: I'm sorry that I left that.",
        "Reva: It's not a problem.",
        "Josh: Well, I'll get it out of here along with the rest of my stuff. I'll move back to the Beacon before we meet with the mediator this afternoon.",
        "Reva: You know, you don't have to do that. What I mean is, there's no rush.",
        "Josh: I appreciate that. I just think it will be a cleaner break if I don't actually have to come back here after we're finished, so... big day, huh? \"D\" day.",
        "Reva: Yeah, so you have any plans for before?",
        "Josh: No, I think I'm just going to work and keep busy.",
        "Reva: Keep busy. Oh, that reminds me. After the papers are signed, I'll be hopping on a plane. I think I'll go spend some time with our little girl in Paris.",
        "Josh: Really? That's great. I'm sure she is going to be happy to see you.",
        "Reva: Well, I'm not so sure.",
        "Josh: Reva, come on.",
        "Reva: No. She's always been protective of you, and rightfully so, and I'm sure she's pretty angry at me for letting you down again.",
        "Josh: You're going to have to make her understand it wasn't just you, that it was both of us. After you.",
        "Reva: ( Laughing ) Okay.",
        "Josh: That was awkward.",
        "Reva: Yes. You know, I just... every time I stop and think about what we're doing...",
        "Josh: I think the thing is we can't really stop to think right now. We just have to move forward. Um, there is something I want to say, though.",
        "Reva: Yeah?",
        "Josh: Just whatever settlement we work out-- settlement, boy-- we work out later today, I just want you to know it is going to be fair. It's going to be good for both of us. No recriminations, no regrets. We will part ways as friends. We will always be friends.",
        "Reva: Always.",
        "Josh: I'll take the suitcase to the car.",
        "Reva: Hi, Angelo. Thanks. You can do this, yes, you can. There's life after Joshua Lewis; there has to be.",
        "Ted: Reva.",
        "Reva: Ted, hi.",
        "Ted: Hope I'm not late.",
        "Reva: No, no. In fact, I just got here myself.",
        "Ted: You look great. It's a great color for you.",
        "Reva: Oh, thank you.",
        "Ted: Did you order drinks?",
        "Reva: No.",
        "Ted: White wine?",
        "Reva: I prefer red.",
        "Ted: You sure. Most women prefer white.",
        "Reva: Well, I'm not most women.",
        "Ted: No, you certainly are not. ( Laughter ) Two red wines. Well, I'm so glad we can do this today.",
        "Reva: Me, too.",
        "Ted: And I have a confession to make. When we met yesterday, I recognized you from your tv show. Truth is, I only saw it a couple of times because I--",
        "Reva: You work during the day, of course.",
        "Ted: But except when I'm having lunch with a beautiful woman. And may I say they were crazy to cancel you. You are a great interviewer, you have such style, such presence. You're truly amazing, you know. Something wrong?",
        "Reva: My husband just walked in-- my ex-husband, I mean.",
        "Ted: You okay?",
        "Reva: Yeah. I mean, I know they have a rule book for dating. I just wonder if anyone has ever written one for divorce.",
        "Ted: I have a copy, and you may borrow it.",

        "Jamie: Josh Lewis? Jamie Reynolds.",
        "Josh: Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were a--",
        "Jamie: A man, yeah. I get that a lot. Do I look like a man?",
        "Josh: Not so much, no.",
        "Jamie: Good answer.",
        "Josh: Have a seat.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ted: I bought out my partner last year and the firm is all mine now, and we only handle portfolios over $2 million.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamie: So, do your kids work with you?",
        "Josh: No, my kids both live in Europe. They're living their own lives.",
        "Jamie: And your wife?",
        "Josh: We are recently separated. There was no other voice...",
        "Jamie: Josh?",
        "Josh: Huh?",
        "Jamie: You just went somewhere.",
        "Josh: Yeah. I'm sorry, this song they're playing right now, we danced to it at our wedding. It's... I can't believe I'm hearing it here, now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: They play this song, today of all days.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: My wife and I are finalizing our divorce today.",
        "Jamie: Oh, Josh, I'm sorry. There is no other voice I miss as much...",

        "Ted: Reva, I'm sorry.",

        "Josh: Sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ted: Come on, Reva, life goes on. As much as you hate it, you've got to suck it up and go! Come on! ( Cell phone rings ) Excuse me, I've got to take this one. It's my biggest client. Mucho bucks. Hi, Larry, you teeing off in New Zealand? Your the sound my heart makes by breathing life lullaby bye bye...",

        "( cell phone rings )",
        "Cassie: Hello.",
        "Reva: Sis, hi, it's me. You were right. We haven't really been in girlfriend mood any time lately, and I know you were just trying to do the right thing, as misguided as it was.",
        "Cassie: Reva, where are you now?",
        "Reva: I'm at Towers.",
        "Cassie: And I thought you had a hot date?",
        "Reva: I do, I am. I'm on it. He is sweet. We're having a lovely time.",
        "Cassie: Since when do you use the word \"lovely,\" and if it is so damn lovely, why you calling me?",
        "Reva: Josh is here with a woman.",
        "Cassie: A woman? Hold on a second, there is someone on the other line. Hello.",
        "Josh: Cassie, hi, it's me. I want to say I'm sorry the way I acted this morning. I realize you were trying to help in your own sort of misguided way.",
        "Cassie: Is there an echo in here?",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Cassie: You're at Towers. How is that business meeting go with that guy?",
        "Josh: The guy? The guy is actually a woman.",
        "Cassie: No. You're kidding me?",
        "Josh: No, I'm not. In fact, she is an attractive way, and it's helping me, which is good because it is helping me not focus on Reva, who's with a date-- who I assume is a date because he's practically pawing her.",
        "Cassie: Sounds like that really bothers you? Don't except it, fight for her, be the hero I know you are and fight for the woman.",
        "Josh: You know what, Cassie, my fighting days are pretty much done--",
        "Cassie: Hold on a second. Don't go anywhere. Reva, you there? What is Josh doing right now?",
        "Reva: He's on the phone.",
        "Cassie: Go over to his table.",
        "Reva: Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Go over there and butt in. It's just a business thing, I'm sure of it. Butt in.",
        "Reva: No. It would seem desperate and pathetic, and I'm neither.",
        "Cassie: Just do it for me.",
        "Reva: What? No. This is crazy. Now, about this guy I'm with, this Ted, I have a question.",
        "Cassie: Oh! ( Laughing )",
        "Reva: Cassie, are you still there?",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Reva: I said I have a question about this guy I'm with. He wants to meet up with me later after the divorce is final to celebrate with champagne. When I told him I thought it's inappropriate, he told me I should suck it up. Don't you think that sounds a bit insensitive?",
        "Josh: Hell, yes.",
        "Reva: Yeah, because I-- wait a minute, who is that?",
        "Josh: Who is that?",
        "Reva: Joshua?",
        "Josh: Reva. What the hell are you doing on the phone?",
        "Reva: What are you doing on the phone?!",
        "Cassie: It's my fault. I was talking to Reva and then Josh. And somehow the wires got-- this is not my fault. This is fate. You guys want destiny? This is destiny. That these lines are crossed, that means to go over and talk to each other, talk, please. Don't just say what you think the other person wants to hear. Just speak from your heart. Because you guys still love each other, damn it, and you have to be together!",
        "Reva: I have to go.",
        "Josh: Me, too.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I'm going to have the salmon with lemon and a little bit of butter.",
        "Ted: Try the red wine sauce. It's terrific.",
        "Reva: I was looking for something lighter.",
        "Ted: It's light.",
        "Reva: I--",
        "Ted: She'll have the red wine sauce. Trust me on this, you're going to love it. Well, am I right. Isn't it delicious?",
        "Reva: Honestly?",
        "Ted: You really don't like it? Or are you just one of those woman who can't admit when she is wrong?",
        "Reva: One of those women?",
        "Ted: All right. One of those people. You know what I mean.",
        "Reva: No, I don't, Ted. Why don't you tell me what you mean?",
        "Ted: Well, I think it's important to be flexible, to be able to admit your mistakes, even when we get older. And, look, when you're divorced, options decrease. And let's face it, Reva, you can't afford to be picky about anything anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: You know what, I need to take care of something. I'm sorry. I'll send you those revised figure, okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I think we need to get something straight, Ted. I am a grown woman, who is over 40, and I'm proud of that because I know who I am, and what I want, and what I need in my life. And what I don't need is some jerk-- who, by the way, is no spring chicken himself-- who goes on and on about his great accomplishments, and his great game of golf, and telling me what I can eat and what I can drink, and that I should be more flexible and I should suck it up. I'll tell you something, I will suck it up if I damn well want to suck it up. And if I want to be miserable, I'll be miserable. And if I want my salmon grilled, plain, I'll have it that way! If you want the wine sauce so much, you have it.",
        "Josh: Okay... time to go. Time to go.",
        "Reva: No, no!",
        "Josh: Nice to meet you, Ted. Come on. Just get in, Reva! Reva, you just need to take it--",
        "Reva: Don't muzzle me. You don't have to muzzle me anymore because you're not responsible for me anymore, remember?",
        "Josh: Just stop, all right?",
        "Reva: You listen to me. In a couple of hours, you don't have to be responsible for me because we'll be divorced, right?",
        "Josh: Reva...",
        "Reva: Right. I'm going back in there.",
        "Josh: No, you are not going back!",
        "Reva: I'm going back; I've got some other things I want to say.",
        "Josh: You're going to calm down. Reva, just stop it. Just stop. Reva! ( Reva screams ) ( splashing ) Great, Reva! This is just great! Thank you! ( Laughter )",
        "Josh: Here, come on. Here, let me help you out of there, okay. Only-- now that I'm thinking about it-- only if you promise to behave.",
        "Reva: You know better than anyone I don't behave. ( Laughing )",
        "Josh: I seem to recall a quiet 1989 when you were behaving.",
        "Reva: Oh, come on. You never liked it. You always loved when I misbehaved even when you said you didn't.",
        "Josh: That's right. Are you cold, honey? Can I help you out here, just a little bit? No, no, I'm fine. Here, let me help you up.",
        "Reva: Yeah, yeah, your wet coat is going to make me feel--",
        "Josh: Is that better?",
        "Reva: A lot warmer.",
        "Josh: Is that better, honey?",
        "Reva: You're such a gentlemen. You know, you've always been such a gentleman, so thoughtful, so kind, and so patient, even when I brought you nothing but grief.",
        "Josh: And joy, Reva. You brought me a lot of joy in my life.",
        "Reva: Yeah, I know.",
        "Josh: What the hell do you think it is with you and fountains?",
        "Reva: It's my favorite place to act out. ( Laughter )",
        "Josh: But this one wasn't really planned, was it?",
        "Reva: No. I just sort of fell into it ( laughing )",
        "Josh: Funny, very funny.",
        "Reva: I don't know. It's you and me, you and me, cross-roads of lifetime. It's water. I don't know, maybe it's a sign.",
        "Josh: A sign of what?",
        "Reva: Well, now, that's the question, isn't it?",
        "Josh: Come on.",
        "Reva: What are you thinking about?",
        "Josh: We'll go inside, we'll sit by the pizza oven and that will keep us warm.",
        "Reva: And really strong coffee. Bud, when we were at Towers, did you hear the song they played?",
        "Josh: Yes, I did.",
        "Reva: That song, that particular song, you know. It was weird that we ended up there together at exactly the same time. And then there was that song and the going into the fountain, it seemed like a lot of coincidences.",
        "Josh: Yeah, it was kind of like--",
        "Reva: What?",
        "Josh: Look at the sidewalk.",
        "Reva: Okay, now this is really scary.",
        "Josh: Look at that. Maybe Cassie's right after all. Maybe it's destiny, fate, trying to tell us something.",
        "Reva: On the day of our divorce. We said we were going to stay out of each other's way today, and yet--",
        "Josh: And yet here we are, together.",
        "Reva: You know, when we were in Tulsa, before the accident, when I was making my speech, I had a revelation.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Reva: I realized that, um, that I believed that you are my destiny, that you always have been and always will be. Oh, my God.",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Reva: Oh, my God. This bouquet, it's my bouquet.",
        "Josh: From which wedding?",
        "Reva: Shush! Look at the little daisies. I mean they're-- well, what would you know about it, you're a man. You wouldn't know the difference between daisies or petunias.",
        "Josh: Okay. Okay. You know what, I'm not sure I really believe in destiny and faith and all of that stuff, but I do know this: That God does things sometimes in weird ways. And if he's trying to tell us something, I think maybe-",
        "Reva: It's too weird. Too weird. It's all just too strange.",
        "Josh: What are you doing?",
        "Reva: Cassie, hey, it's me, sis, Josh and I are standing outside Company right now and would really love to see you, so if you're anywhere within the vicinity, get your skinny butt out here now.",
        "Cassie: Hi.",
        "Reva: Uh-huh.",
        "Cassie: Now don't be mad at me.",
        "Josh: Okay, would somebody like to tell me what's going on here?",
        "Cassie: Reva will fill you in.",
        "Reva: No, no, you're not going anywhere. And you, check out the tag on that bouquet.",
        "Josh: Beacon Hotel.",
        "Reva: Yeah, confession, it's so good for the soul.",
        "Cassie: Fine. My bad. Now can I go?",
        "Reva: No. I want the story, Cassie, the whole story.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Neither one of you wants the divorce, but you're both too stubborn to admit, so I took matters into my own hands.",
        "Josh: And the appointment that was rescheduled?",
        "Cassie: That was me.",
        "Reva: And you had them play our song?",
        "Cassie: I happen to know the maitre 'D.",
        "Reva: And those flowers and the chalk?",
        "Cassie: I followed you here to Towers so you both could see how stupid you are being. Okay, I'll back off, but I will not apologize for trying to saving you both from yourself.",
        "Reva: Go.",
        "Cassie: Just remember it's not too late.",
        "Reva: What did I say?",
        "Cassie: I just think you two should stay together.",
        "Reva: So, so much for the signs we saw.",
        "Josh: Yeah. I guess there was nothing special about any of it.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, because there's really nothing special about us. I guess always doesn't last forever, huh?",
        "Josh: Okay. Then I guess we're still on for 3:00.",
        "Reva: See you then.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ms. Vogel: I've incorporated notes from our phone conversations into the final drafts you have before you. Now, I have a few remaining questions. But if you two continue to be as generous and fair to each other as you have up until now, we should have a final settlement today. And then I'll file the papers for you and the divorce will be official. All right, let's begin at the beginning: Page one, the house.",
        "Josh: Reva keeps the house.",
        "Ms. Vogel: Is that all right with you, Reva?",
        "Reva: Yeah, I guess. Unless you want to sell it or...",
        "Josh: No. Marah and Shayne need some place to come home to.",
        "Ms. Vogel: All right then, Reva gets the house. Next, Josh, you're keeping your car and Reva is keeping hers, and the third you agreed will stay in Reva's name... The stands in your eyes, that color of them wonderful stop me and steal my breath and emeralds from mountains thrust towards the sky never revealing their depth tell me, that we belong together dress it up with the trappings of love I'll be captivated I'll hang from your lips instead of the gallows of heartache that hangs from above and I'll be your crying shoulder I'll be love's suicide and I'll be better when I'm older I'll be the greatest fan of your life and I've dropped out, I've burned up, I fought my way back from the dead...",
        "Ms. Vogel: Sign there, Josh. And you sign there, Reva. And we'll be done. And I'll be your crying shoulder I'll be the greatest fan of your life I'll be the greatest fan in you life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: What are you doing here?",
        "Josh: I guess I'm doing the same thing you are. You okay?",
        "Reva: Yeah, yeah. You?",
        "Josh: I've been better.",
        "Reva: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Josh: I just figured that most of our marriage was spent right here in Springfield, so this would be a good place to come and think.",
        "Reva: Everything seems so clear from up here, doesn't it?",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Reva: Too bad the rest of life isn't that easy. What went wrong?",
        "Josh: I don't know, Reva. I really don't--",
        "Reva: We loved each other so much.",
        "Josh: I still love you.",
        "Reva: Even since we were kids, you know. You were always the one for me, Joshua. Always were; always will be.",
        "Josh: It's the same thing for me.",
        "Reva: Why wasn't it enough? Because of me, because I didn't know how good I had it.",
        "Josh: No, Reva. It was because of me, too. It was both of us.",
        "Reva: No. You know, it should be storming tonight, the end of us. You know, there should be these big black clouds rolling in.",
        "Josh: Thunder, right? Lightning. The Gods angry at us because we couldn't figure out how to make it work.",
        "Reva: It should be written on the stars. It should be written in the wind. \"You fools, don't file those papers!\" But instead it's this beautiful night, you know. It's quiet, clear. Life goes on.",
        "Josh: You feel good.",
        "Reva: So do you.",
        "Josh: Listen to me. We've been fools. We've been looking out there somewhere trying to find answers, and the fact is the answers are here and they're here. They always have been.",
        "Reva: Always. And the signs are there; they're there every day. The way my heart skips a beat every time you walk into a room.",
        "Josh: Yeah. And the way I can't wait to get home to you at night and hear you laugh, and smell your hair.",
        "Reva: Feel your hand in mine. And be grateful, you know, so, so grateful that time and time again you found a way to forgive me, even when I was at my worst, my absolute worst, like these past few months. I was so stubborn, Joshua. I was. In Tulsa, I had this realization, I did. I knew that I made this mistake. I wanted to tell you that it was all a mistake. That I really... that I wanted you, and that I needed you, and to please come back. I thought you wanted to get rid of me.",
        "Josh: No. No, no, no. You were unhappy and you said that it was my fault that you were unhappy--",
        "Reva: Oh, no.",
        "Josh: You said you wanted your freedom, so I gave you your freedom, right?",
        "Reva: You didn't want to?",
        "Josh: No, no. Reva, all I've ever wanted, ever in my whole life is to be with you. Don't you understand that?",
        "Reva: In our house?",
        "Josh: Yes.",
        "Reva: In our big, beautiful house! ( Laughing ) You don't want to split our assets?",
        "Josh: No",
        "Reva: You don't want to leave--",
        "Josh: No!",
