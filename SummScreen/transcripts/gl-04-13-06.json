        "Dinah prepares for the ball, asking Mallet that if Harley shows up to send her home to be with her family. As she puts the final touches on everything, she basks in her success. She is getting ready to give her speech when monitors are wheeled in and Harley's pre-recorded speech is given instead. Dinah complains to Jeffrey who is trying to get her on his campaign trail by getting the dirt on Blake, who is at the same time trying to get the dirt on Jeffrey from Cassie. After Jeffrey leaves, Dinah pushes the monitor with Harley's image off of the roof. Olivia meets Frank in the elevator and convinces him to give her another chance. She tells him that Buzz was there for her and she won't apologize for that but that he pushed them together because he wanted her to be happy. Buzz, who is at the party with Marina, spends most of the night hiding from Frank. Frank agrees that they need to talk but tells Olivia that it is something that needs to just be the two of them. Tammy goes home and tells Cassie that Jonathan wants nothing to do with her after what she did. Cassie tells Tammy that although she still doesn't want her with Jonathan she won't stand in their way anymore. Lizzie tells Jonathan that he needs to make Tammy sweat for a while and teases him about their one night together. Tammy wonders to Cassie how she can get Jonathan to take her back when he won't even answer her calls and from the doorway, he says that she should just talk to him. He asks Cassie if she has been telling Tammy reasons to stay away from him and Cassie tells him that she is through coming between them. Tammy and Jonathan go back to Outskirts together and he tells her that he won't hurt her again."

        "Tammy: Come on, Jonathan, pick up.",
        "Cassie: You just can't stay away from him, can you? How long did you last, maybe two weeks tops?",
        "Tammy: Mom, you don't understand.",
        "Cassie: Oh, honey, I understand more than you know. I understand that Jonathan hurt you so badly you took out a retraining order against him, and now you're going back.",
        "Tammy: It doesn't matter because this time, he won't take me back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Hold on, hold on. Yup, you are going to be the most handsomest man at the ball.",
        "Buzz: Why don't you say hello to your dad. It's a big event for him; I don't want to ruin it. So--",
        "Marina: Why would you ruin it for him?",
        "Buzz: You don't need your old granddad when you're--",
        "Marina: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're not old. You're a little freaky sometimes, but not old. Wait a second!",
        "Buzz: I need some air.",
        "Marina: You promised me a dance. Are you reneging on me?",
        "Buzz: No, its just, um...",
        "Marina: What?",
        "Buzz: I'm scared.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: You invited me to the ball, did you think I was going to let you off the hook that easy.",
        "Frank: Well I just thought after the other night, I thought that uh--",
        "Olivia: I chose you, you know.",
        "Frank: Excuse me.",
        "Olivia: Your father and I were together at the inn that one time. It seemed right at the time, but afterwards, when I had a choice to make, I chose you. I chose you then, and I choose you now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Excuse me, Miss? Do you know the hot-shot behind this event?",
        "Dinah: That would be me, Ms. Hot-shot to you, pal.",
        "Mallet: Well, Ms. Hot-shot, I don't know whether to shake your hand or-- better yet-- wow, you look amazing. You really do it for me, do you know that?",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs ) Thank you, thank you. It's kind of like giving birth. You know, you spend all of the hours plugging away at this thing and cursing people out, but you know what, at the end, it looks pretty amazing. You produce something amazing.",
        "Mallet: Really amazing. And is there anything I can do? He says as he is eyeing the free shrimp cocktail.",
        "Dinah: Well, I think, Officer, tonight is your night to just look pretty on my arm.",
        "Mallet: Is that all I am to you?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Is that a problem to you?",
        "Mallet: I can do pretty.",
        "Dinah: There actually is one other thing--",
        "Mallet: What?",
        "Dinah: --That you can help me out with? Harley.",
        "Mallet: What about her?",
        "Dinah: Well, you know she is home taking care of her family. And you know, I just-- you know her. If she comes in tonight, I want you to turn her around and send her home, okay, no arguments.",
        "Mallet: I can't promise you there won't be an argument, but I'll do what I can do.",
        "Dinah: Okay. You know, I mean Gus has been through a lot. She's been through a lot and she needs to make him a priority tonight, okay-- for everybody's sake.",
        "Mallet: Does she know how protective you are?",
        "Dinah: She has no idea. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Mallet: I've got to take this. The station.",
        "Dinah: Okay.",
        "Mallet: Be right back. Yeah, Mallet. ( Cell phone ringing )",
        "Dinah: No. Not tonight, Harley, not tonight. ( Music playing ) I've got a funny feeling...",
        "Olivia: Ooh, wrong floor, wrong attitude, wrong everything.",
        "Frank: What do you expect me to say, Olivia? It was okay that you slept with my father?",
        "Olivia: Listen, I am sorry about what you heard and certainly the way that you heard it. I never meant to hurt you, Frank, but I'm not sorry that I turned to Buzz that night, okay. I'm not going to apologize to you or to anybody else.",
        "Frank: I'm not looking for an apology. I'm struggling here. I'm trying to understand why my father pushed us together when all along he wanted you in the first place.",
        "Olivia: It's because he loves you, Frank. He wants you to be happy.",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, he's got a very funny way of showing it.",
        "Olivia: Buzz and I have a connection, that's all.",
        "Frank: What about us, Olivia? What about our connection?",
        "Olivia: We have more than that. We have the potential to be-- when I'm with you, I feel safe.",
        "Frank: Could that be because I'm the Chief of Police?",
        "Olivia: Yeah, it could be. It could also be that for the first time in my life I'm with somebody who sees me better than I am. I just wish that we had more time to see what we could be together.",
        "Frank: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Olivia: Give us another chance.",
        "Frank: Why do you keep pushing this?",
        "Olivia: Because I told you, I want to see this through didn't you ever need a second chance, Frank?",
        "Frank: Yeah, I did.",
        "Olivia: Did you get it?",
        "Frank: No, I didn't.",
        "Olivia: Give us a second chance.",
        "Frank: Why don't we see how tonight goes.",
        "Olivia: Together?",
        "Frank: Yeah, together.",
        "Marina: Hey, Dad. Olivia, you look beautiful, doesn't she?",
        "Olivia: Thank you. You look great yourself. Hi.",
        "Buzz: Hi.",
        "Frank: You know, we should get inside because the Chief of Police shouldn't be late for an event that is honoring the department, so excuse us.",
        "Marina: Is dad mad at you or something?",
        "Buzz: Whatever gave you that impression?",
        "Marina: What happened?",
        "Buzz: What didn't.",
        "Marina: Come on, tell me. Tell me!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reporter: I hear you're the driving force behind tonight's benefit, is that true?",
        "Dinah: Well, I have had a lot of help, believe me, but, yeah, this is my first big project as interim CEO. From the get-go, I knew what the focus should be, on the men and women who sacrifice everything for us, for their families. And every dollar that will be raised here this evening will go to the loved ones of officers killed in the line of duty. That's why all costs will be bankrolled by Spaulding. So everything that you see from the invitations to the food, to the pen you swiped off the table-- ( laughs ) I'm kidding, I kidding. It's yours; I want you to have it. It will all be paid for by Spaulding.",
        "Reporter: Ms. Marler, I understand ticket sales are double what they were last year.",
        "Dinah: Actually, I am three ticket sales short of double. So if you care to buy them, we're all good. ( Laughter )",
        "Alexandra: Well, I will. As a matter of fact, put me down for 50.",
        "Dinah: Oh, well, thank you, Alexandra. Excuse us, gentlemen. Thank you. That was quite generous, thank you. What a nice surprise.",
        "Alexandra: Well, is it? I'm surprised at your propensity for self-promoting.",
        "Dinah: I'm glad you could make it this evening, Alexandra, I am.",
        "Alexandra: Yes, well, I am a Spaulding, am I not? I think a Spaulding should be here to represent the company.",
        "Dinah: I am representing the company.",
        "Alexandra: Hm.",
        "Mallet: This is a great party.",
        "Dinah: Good.",
        "Mallet: Can we leave now?",
        "Dinah: Leave? It's barely starting.",
        "Mallet: I know, but you look so beautiful, I just want to take you home. I get insecure if I have to share you with the public.",
        "Dinah: Okay, listen. If we play our cards right, there may be an empty stairwell with our name on it come desert.",
        "Mallet: You're naughty.",
        "Dinah: I know.",
        "Mallet: You're so in charge, it's a big turn on.",
        "Dinah: Oh, it's nice being in charge though, for once.",
        "Mallet: Yeah.",
        "Dinah: It's good.",
        "Mallet: Your dad would be proud of you.",
        "Dinah: My goodness, I hope he can see me up there.",
        "Mallet: Hey, he can see you; he's watching you. Look at everything you've done.",
        "Dinah: You know, the story of Cinderella, when the stroke of midnight happens, you know what happens, right?",
        "Mallet: Uh-huh. Walk towards the dawn.",
        "Dinah: Yes, I know, but you know what, Mallet? I feel accepted, I feel good, I feel happy, and I just want you to promise me that the magic won't end, okay? It's just it's never going to end. Just promise me that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Here, let me help you.",
        "Blake: Oh. That's all right, I can do it.",
        "Jeffrey: Well you haven't quite got there.",
        "Blake: No, really, I can do it. That's Ross's job.",
        "Jeffrey: Of course, I'm sorry. Did you think I was going to take advantage, cop a feel or something?",
        "Blake: It's not what I was thinking. What are you doing here anyway, trying to get the law enforcement vote?",
        "Jeffrey: I am law enforcement-- although a few of my detractors may vote against me. How's it going?",
        "Blake: Getting endorsements all over the place. It's amazing because Ross is so well-loved. And he was. But I still can't believe it, you know?",
        "Jeffrey: I know.",
        "Blake: What is Springfield without Ross Marler? He is the soul. That's what the Commissioner just said, that he's the soul. He's backing me, by the way, the Commissioner.",
        "Jeffrey: Blake, you know, I think it's really wonderful that you want to run for mayor as a sort of tribute/memorial to Ross, but you're grieving right now. You're trying to raise three kids on your own. Why go through that? Why don't you drop out. You can support me...",
        "Blake: Drop out and support you? ( Laughs ) Oh, dear. Oh, dear. You're afraid of me. You're afraid I will wipe the floor with you. You have every right to be afraid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Jonathan is pushing you away?",
        "Tammy: He doesn't trust that I'm not going to leave him again. But this time it's forever.",
        "Cassie: Forever is a big word, honey.",
        "Tammy: He's not perfect, but I don't expect him to be.",
        "Cassie: Well, that's good because there is no perfect man.",
        "Tammy: I love Jonathan, Mom, and I want to be with him. Yeah, we have problems, just like you did with Hart and Richard and Edmund-- even Jeffrey. You know, if we really work hard, really try, maybe we can work through them. I don't want to cut and run every time something goes wrong; I want to deal. I want to deal; I want to make it work.",
        "Cassie: Tammy--",
        "Tammy: No, listen to me, Mom you did everything you can to try to turn me away from Jonathan, but I can't stay away from him, and maybe you will lock me in the bedroom right now--",
        "Cassie: Tammy, can I please say something? Please! Honey... I am not going to try to keep you away from Jonathan anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: No. I need information not gossip. Why don't you go to the boarding house and break into Ava's room and go through her stuff. Isn't that what P.I.'s do? Well, then do something.",
        "Jonathan: You don't belong here.",
        "Lizzie: Why not, lover?",
        "Jonathan: Real funny.",
        "Lizzie: Relax, Tammy's not here.",
        "Jonathan: No, that's because I told her to leave.",
        "Lizzie: You did? Why is that?",
        "Jonathan: Because she got a restraining order against me. What am I supposed to do, ask her to stay?",
        "Lizzie: Admit it, it's me. You had one night with me, you've fallen madly in love. It's okay, I don't blame you.",
        "Jonathan: No, I think Tammy just needs to hurt a little bit so she understands how she hurt me.",
        "Lizzie: What, and then you are just going to... you're just going to take her back?",
        "Jonathan: She's all I want.",
        "Lizzie: Then it's a good thing I got here when I did. You're about to blow it. Dude, you can't just take her back right now; you've got to make her jump through some hoops and I can help you.",
        "Jonathan: Don't do it.",
        "Lizzie: What, I can't help you?",
        "Jonathan: You want me to help get Coop away from Ava. That's why you want me away from Tammy? Word of advice: Nobody comes between me and Tammy. You shouldn't either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Buzz, where you rushing off to? You are sneaking out, aren't you?",
        "Buzz: You always did have my number. Wow, you look stunning tonight. I'd ask you for a dance, but--",
        "Alexandra: Thank you very much. But you're rushing off.",
        "Buzz: Yeah.",
        "Alexandra: And I shouldn't ask why, should I?",
        "Buzz: Listen, if Frank or Marina ask where I went--",
        "Alexandra: I'll say I haven't seen you-- haven't seen you in years. You look stunning yourself. I would ask you to dance, but--",
        "Buzz: Rain check.",
        "Alexandra: Rain check.",
        "Buzz: Come on.",
        "Olivia: If you leave, I'll have to kill you.",
        "Buzz: Well, that would be a big mistake with all of these cops around.",
        "Olivia: Well, you given me no choice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: You think I'm some grieving widow looking for a way to pass the time.",
        "Jeffrey: Blake, all I was trying to do was to give you--",
        "Blake: You're afraid I'm going to win on a sympathy vote. I am going to win, but it won't be from sympathy. Jeffrey, you ought to ask around about who I was before Ross came into my life. I won some, I lost some. I was never afraid to fight.",
        "Jeffrey: Fair enough. May the best man win.",
        "Blake: And he will be a woman.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: You want me to be with Jonathan?",
        "Cassie: No, I don't want you to be with Jonathan. But I won't get in the way anymore.",
        "Tammy: Why? What changed your mind?",
        "Cassie: I don't like who I am when I'm threatening you. And my job as your mother is to help you grow up and let you make your own mistakes. Your own decisions. And that's what I'm going to do.",
        "Tammy: I love you. Oh, I love you so, so much.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I love you, too. Life is short, honey. I've been reminded of that a lot, lately. Ross is gone, and Sandy. And you just never know what tomorrow might bring. If my last words to you were \"get the hell away from Jonathan and don't come home,\" I couldn't bear it.",
        "Tammy: Neither could I. I'm going to make this work for all of us, Mom, I am. That is if Jonathan ever comes around.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Paranoid much?",
        "Jonathan: No, I just want you to understand.",
        "Lizzie: Understand what, that you're just as psycho as everyone says you are?",
        "Jonathan: That this isn't a game to me.",
        "Lizzie: Me, either. I need Coop in my life.",
        "Jonathan: I don't care.",
        "Lizzie: Is this how you treat all of your lovers?",
        "Jonathan: Stop saying that word.",
        "Lizzie: I think it sounds very cosmopolitan, maybe a little creepy, but--",
        "Jonathan: Maybe you're a little creepy. I think that you should leave right now.",
        "Lizzie: What do you know about breaking into a room?",
        "Jonathan: I know that I'm not getting involved in your issues with Ava, Lizzie. You and I are done.",
        "Lizzie: You think you have this all figured out? But you are more screwed up than I am. And you know nothing about women at all.",
        "Jonathan: Well, that's not what you were screaming about the other night.",
        "Lizzie: Maybe you know a few things. But not what goes on in their mind. If you are this easy, Tammy-- she's going to take you for granted again. Listen to me, you need to make her want you, want you the way that you wanted her-- obsessively, passionately, like a prize. Trust me, I know all about this.",
        "Jonathan: From all of your experience?",
        "Lizzie: Okay, how many times have you been in love? Hmm, yeah, see, I do have more experience than you, and I'm a girl.",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughing ) Oh, Tammy is nothing like you.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, maybe she's not. But she's not like you, either. You are hurt, you are angry, and you need to use that. You've got to make her suffer, Johnny; you got to make her beg. You need to make her understand how much she hurt you, and how much she needs you. ( Applause )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: My speech is next. I'm a little nervous.",
        "Mallet: You just have to use it; you'll be fine.",
        "Dinah: I will, I will.",
        "Frank: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I am Police Chief Frank Cooper.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: I thought I would give you and Frank a little space.",
        "Olivia: I appreciate that, but you don't have to do that. You wanted to tell Frank about us, and I didn't. It came out in the worst possible way and we can't take it back. So can we move forward. I'll work on him; I'll bring him around.",
        "Buzz: That could take years with Frank.",
        "Olivia: Well, he was angry with me when we got in the elevator. By the time we up here, he was at least he is talking to me.",
        "Buzz: ( Laughing ) You have powers of persuasion that, you know, I don't have.",
        "Olivia: Frank and I are going to give it a second chance, Buzz?",
        "Buzz: Good.",
        "Olivia: Then stay. Let's just-- let's all start over. Please?",
        "Buzz: I'm going to regret this.",
        "Olivia: No, no, you won't. You know, with all of those tricks you pulled to push us together, it really wasn't necessary, but... it was very sweet.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, that's me, you know, sweet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Something wrong, Chief Cooper?",
        "Frank: No, no. No, there is nothing wrong. We the Springfield Police Department, would like to thank Spaulding Enterprises, for one, for hosting this lovely event, and, two, for picking up the tab. ( Laughter ) ( applause ) I'm sure you're all aware of the recent changes that have gone on in Spaulding. And I'm sure it has everything to do with my sister Harley being the new CEO. ( Laughing ) I know I'm a little biased, but anyway... in all sincerity, thanks to Spaulding because I think our future looks a little brighter. Let's give a big round of applause to Spaulding and I'd like to welcome Dinah Marler. ( Applause )",
        "Dinah: Thank you, Frank. Okay. Well, again, thank you for everything this evening, everybody. Thank you for showing and um... ( whispers ) What's going on? Whoa. What do we have here?",
        "Harley: Good evening, everyone, I am Harley Cooper, CEO of Spaulding Enterprises, and on behalf of our entire workforce, I would like to welcome you here this evening. I am so proud and honored to be your host.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcy Rylan, \"Inside The Light.\" The right girl for Coop. Ava. I know, I said it. I kind of feel bad for the guy. A makeup room? ( Laughs ) I'd like to go in there and torture them. If I wasn't an actor, I would be going to law school. See Lizzie, Wednesday, \"Inside The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: All of the proceeds from tonight's benefit will be donated to the husbands, wives and children of police officers slain why courageously fighting to protect all of us. This is a special privilege for me as my brother Frank is Chief of Police, my husband Gus is a detective, and my niece, Marina recently joined the force. I, myself, was a detective, and those were the proudest days of my life. In that time, however, I lost countless co- workers and friends. I stood on the sidelines and watched as their families grieved. But I never fully understood that grief until recently when I thought I lost the love of my life, my husband, Gus. I can tell you firsthand what it's like to receive that call, to believe that your other half is never coming home. Pain does not describe it. Agony doesn't do it justice. You are empty, you are in shock, you are barely able to function. That is why the money we're raising tonight is so important. It will supply scholarships, pay off mortgages, provide healthcare and living expenses for the families of police officers who made the ultimate sacrifice to keep each and every one of us safe. Spaulding has worked long and hard to make this is a great event worthy of this cause, and that means we want you to have fun. That's an order. So thank you for coming. And before I forget, a special thank you to Dinah Marler for all of her hard work. Have a wonderful night everybody! ( Applause )",
        "Dinah: Hello, is this on? Can I get this on, please. Hello?",
        "Mallet: Hey, hey, hey. Did you know Harley was going to speak tonight?",
        "Dinah: I can't believe this is happening.",

        "Frank: Well, that's it. No more speeches tonight, so...",
        "Olivia: Good, now we can just get drunk.",
        "Frank: How's my dad holding up?",
        "Olivia: Why don't you ask him yourself? No, I guess not, I just wish--",
        "Frank: Olivia, go right ahead and say what you want to say, seriously.",
        "Olivia: Frank, your father helped me to look inside myself. He helped me realize not only what I wanted, but what I needed. I used to think romance was a big contest, something you had to win and that love was supposed to be a challenge. Hard to get, even harder to keep. But your dad helped me realize it doesn't have to be that way. Lucky for me. Lucky for you.",

        "Marina: Big night, Remy. You're right.",
        "Remy: What's wrong?",

        "Dinah: Hi.",
        "Frank: Not only do you look beautiful, but you are doing a terrific job. And how about that sister of mine? Is she amazing or what? She is just totally full of surprises.",
        "Jeffrey: Frank, can I borrow this lovely young lady from you?",
        "Frank: Absolutely.",
        "Jeffrey: Thank you. Nice speech, by the way.",
        "Frank: Thank you. Thank you very much.",
        "Jeffrey: Nice party, but you seem a little stressed out?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, well I received several extra surprises, but you know me, I roll with the punches.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, I know you. It sounds like you need an in with the next mayor, but lucky for you, you already slept with him. But one good turn, deserves another. I need a couple of favors.",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Jeffrey: I need you to answer a couple of questions about your stepmother, Blake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: Hey, Cassie, it's me, Blake. I haven't heard from you in a couple of days, and I don't know, I kind of need somebody to talk to, and I'm sure you do, too, about Tammy and Jeffrey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Jeffrey, I don't want to talk about it. Really, this is a very special night. This was a very special night.",
        "Jeffrey: Come on, you can tell me. I might be able to help.",
        "Dinah: I'll tell you what, this is about Harley. I have slept about three hours a night since putting this whole thing together, okay and what happens? Suddenly Harley reels in the monitors and she is taking the credit, and I am invisible, and an after-thought, at best.",

        "Tammy: It's me again, Jonathan. I get that you're mad about the restraining order, but just call me back, please.",
        "Cassie: I've got a little something that might cheer you up. Two tickets to the police charity ball. We can get all dressed up and we can go over there.",
        "Tammy: Isn't it kind of late?",
        "Cassie: So, we'll make a grand entrance. We can flirt with a few cops.",
        "Tammy: Are you serious?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I've been thinking, I need to get out of the house and shake things up a bit. So, come on, you can be my wing man.",
        "Tammy: Any other night I would say yes.",
        "Cassie: What, but tonight you would rather stay home and wait for the phone to ring?",
        "Tammy: I can't help it, Mom. I need to act fast. I need to make Jonathan see that I love him, and how can I do that if he won't even call me back?",
        "Jonathan: Well, you could do that by just telling him to his face.",
        "Tammy: Hi.",
        "Jonathan: Hi. I hope I'm not interrupting anything, a little mother/daughter bonding.",
        "Cassie: She has been calling you and calling you. At least we know you're all right, anyway.",

        "Jonathan: Is she pumping you full of reasons to leave again?",
        "Tammy: Not this time.",

        "Cassie: No. I am not going to get in the way again.",

        "Jonathan: I wanted to make you wait. I wanted you to prove yourself.",
        "Tammy: I'll prove it every day.",
        "Jonathan: And I wanted to hurt you, but I don't want to hurt you anymore.",

        "Tammy: Look, you should go to that party.",
        "Cassie: I think I'm going to pass.",

        "Jonathan: A little friendly advice from a friend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Trust me, you are not invisible. Which is all the more reason why you should join my campaign, you know. You can help me shore up Spaulding, not to mention the entire Springfield Police Department.",
        "Dinah: Well, you know what, you need to be courting Harley, but you need to get in line first, because I think every man in Springfield is after her.",
        "Jeffrey: Have you been listening to a word I'm saying? I don't want Harley. I want you. What is this with Harley? Forget about Harley.",
        "Dinah: You know, I've been trying, but I just can't. And I don't think Mallet can either.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, what are you talking about?",
        "Dinah: Look, Jeffrey, it is very complicated, and it's all jumbled up in my head, still. And so that, along with tonight's evening and what is going on at Spaulding, I... I'm going to go. But I will be fine. I'll be fine.",

        "Frank: Yeah, I know we do. But I'm kind of glad he's gone because right now I don't know how.",
        "Olivia: Can't we all just sit down--",
        "Frank: Olivia, no offense, but this is between me and my father, and I think it's best it stays that way. How about that drink?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Well, that was a very good idea, the videotape. Don't you think? Inspirational. Was it your idea or Harley's?",
        "Dinah: What do you say we talk about it another day?",
        "Alexandra: Wait a minute, you're brushing me off twice in one night. You should remember who you're working for.",

        "Jonathan: ( Breathing heavy ) Trust?",
        "Tammy: If we trust each other, and trust in our love for each other, then things that hurt won't be enough to split us up. Trust will keep us together. Does that make sense? ( Door slams )",

        "Dinah: I rented the restaurant. I ordered the flowers. I ordered the band. I did everything. I wrote a speech. I wrote a speech! You want to come in on my party? You want to make things impossible for you to shut your big mouth. Every single time I've got something to say, you've got something to say, don't you? I'll tell you something, I'm going to make sure that you never speak again. ( Screams ) Yeah!!",
