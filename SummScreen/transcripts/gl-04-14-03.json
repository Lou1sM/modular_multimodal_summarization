He admits that Richard is teaching him even now and that he intends to live by Richard's words. Cassie tells Edmund that he needs to learn how to love people. That will make him a better person. She leaves. Edmund reflects on Richard and the love he shared with Cassie. Edmund looks at Cassie in amazement. Michelle visits Harley and they discuss Harley's experience with Nadine. Buzz talks to Gus and tells him to get his act together. He tells him that he doesn't need the Spaulding name to make him act like a jerk.",
        "Harley couldn't \"remember\" her shooting. Gus considered Spaulding as an option, and Buzz tried to relate to Gus while playing basketball. Danny met with the Mayor and was congratulated for his efforts to clean up Fifth Street. He also got Ed to agree to a plan for a mobile clinic. Alan's mind cleared until Alexandra drugged his drink. Edward continued his campaign to change, and Cassie is beginning to believe he is trying. The show ended with Gus face-to-face with Alan."

        "Michelle: Danny.",
        "Danny: Hey. What are... Didn't I just see you at breakfast at home? What, do you miss me already?",
        "Michelle: You are a hard man to catch up with, Danny Santos.",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Michelle: The mailman came two seconds after you left.",
        "Danny: Uh-huh. Well, what's so important that you had to chase me down? Did we win the sweepstakes or something?",
        "Michelle: No, this.",
        "Danny: Okay, we're... we're invited to the first annual fund-raiser for Richard Winslow's library.",
        "Michelle: It's our first official piece of mail to our new house.",
        "Danny: Well, that's... that's great. That's... that's very... That's not right.",
        "Michelle: What? What's not right?",
        "Danny: Well, it should say \"Mr. And Mrs. Santos.\"",
        "Michelle: Well, it can't say \"Mr. And Mrs.\" until we're married, and we're not yet. So, why don't you hurry up and make an honest woman out of me?",
        "Danny: Well, that might be very difficult to do, considering...",
        "Michelle: Considering what? You're marrying me. You have no choice.",
        "Danny: I'm talking about the \"honest woman\" part. Come on, honey, I know you love a sentimental gesture as much as the next girl, but you did not chase me down here to show me this.",
        "Michelle: Oh, okay. Then why am I here?",
        "Danny: To check up on me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: No. I can't do it.",
        "Harley: Sorry, I just... I don't remember. Dr. Bauer said it would take a while for it all to come back.",
        "Moses: Just try again, Detective Cooper. Go back to that day just before the shooting started. It's important.",
        "Gus: Excuse me. I think I just heard her say she doesn't remember anything. So why don't you get out? Get out!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Doris.",
        "Doris: Alexandra.",
        "Alexandra: My, my. Are you planning on escorting Alan to the hospital personally?",
        "Doris: (Laughs)... No, no. These are just some forms that I need you to give to the doctor to fill out.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, thank you. Look, Doris, is there any way we can put off this probing and this prodding session? I mean, I'm afraid this might throw Alan right over the edge.",
        "Doris: Absolutely not. I have a responsibility to the community. But trust me, Alexandra, I'm looking out for Alan's interests, too.",
        "Alexandra: Can't you give him just one more day, huh?",
        "Doris: Well, what difference would one day make? I mean, the sooner we get this over with, the sooner that he can get better, and I'm sure that's what you all want. Alan most of all. Oh, you know what? I have to call my office. I forgot my cell phone. Could I use your phone?",
        "Alexandra: Well, actually, I'm expecting a call here, but Lloyd's right down the hall, and he'll show you to another phone. Here you go.",
        "Alan: (Clears throat)",
        "Alexandra: Alan, you should be in bed.",
        "Alan: No, not anymore, Alexandra. I have never felt better. I am back!",
        "Alexandra: Well, I'm so glad, brother dear. Where exactly have you been?",
        "Alan: Well, you know, I wish I could answer that question for you. My mind was very cloudy there for a while. But you see, I see everything clearly now.",
        "Alexandra: Well, good, good. Good. Why don't we go into the dining room? We'll have cook prepare you something. You and I will sit down and have a good chat.",
        "Alan: No, no, I don't want anything to eat. I just want you to tell me what's been going on while I've been gone.",
        "Alexandra: All right, okay. Give me a minute. I've got a messenger coming by-- something I'm sending to the office, so I'll be right back.",
        "Doris: You know, Alex, I have some time now. If you'd like, maybe I can go over...",
        "Alexandra: No.",
        "Doris: ...These forms with you. The more you understand...",
        "Alexandra: Thank you.",
        "Doris: Alexandra?",
        "Alexandra: You've already been more than gracious with your time. I'm sure that the doctor and the lawyer can explain everything I need to know.",
        "Doris: All right. Then I better get going. I'll see you and Alan at the hearing.",
        "Alexandra: Yes, you'll see us there.",
        "Alan: Were you talking to someone out there?",
        "Alexandra: Just the messenger.",
        "Alan: Oh, well, that's good. At least I'm not hearing voices anymore. Now, you sent the package to the office. Don't you think you should tell me what was in it? I mean, I need to get up to speed, especially about things with the company.",
        "Alexandra: Come on, Alan. You're fresh for five minutes, you want to jump right back into business?",
        "Alan: Yes, absolutely.",
        "Alexandra: I think... Just stop for a minute. I think you should have something to eat, something to put in your stomach.",
        "Alan: I don't want anything to eat in this house, Alexandra.",
        "Alexandra: Going on a hunger strike isn't going to bring you back 100%.",
        "Alan: Who knows? It may do wonders for my sanity.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Detective Moses, please just... I would just ask you nicely to leave the...",
        "Harley: Please just do it and get it over with.",
        "Gus: He's taking advantage of you just because you're lying in a hospital bed. She's vulnerable.",
        "Moses: I don't think I'm the one who's taking advantage.",
        "Gus: Now, what does that mean?",
        "Moses: Detective Cooper is trying to remember what happened on the night she was shot. You're stopping it. Why? Are you afraid of what she's going to say about you?",
        "Gus: What don't you understand? I don't care what happens to me.",
        "Moses: That would make two of us.",
        "Gus: I only care what happens to her, okay?",
        "Harley: Thank God, you're here. (Loud arguing)",
        "Buzz: Could you take this outside?",
        "Moses: Detective Cooper, I'll be back when you're feeling a little stronger.",
        "Gus: Yeah, like in a month.",
        "Buzz: Gus!",
        "Gus: You're kidding me, right?",
        "Buzz: Outside! Gentlemen, my daughter has just been through hell. She just got through surgery. What she needs is to be calm and to rest. That wasn't very restful there. You're just going to have to wait for your answers.",
        "Moses: Yeah, after her boyfriend here feeds them to her.",
        "Buzz: Nobody's feeding anything to her. When she's ready, you'll get the truth. She's not ready now. She needs rest. Am I making myself clear?",
        "Moses: Crystal. I'll be back.",
        "Gus: The guy's a clown.",
        "Buzz: No, I'm not done with you.",
        "Gus: Thank you for saving me from myself.",
        "Buzz: By a long shot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Come on, honey. You did not chase me down here to show me our first piece of mail. You're not that sentimental.",
        "Michelle: Yes, I am. I've saved Robbie's first everything.",
        "Danny: Uh-huh. So my meeting has nothing to do with you being here?",
        "Michelle: Oh, you think that I want to meet the mayor.",
        "Danny: No, no, no, no. My other meeting, the one with your dad.",
        "Michelle: Um, I think I see my father enough, don't you?",
        "Danny: But I don't. And this is my first face-to-face with him since you and I got back together, and that's why you're playing postman today. Am I right? Huh?",
        "Michelle: All right, fine.",
        "Danny: Admit it.",
        "Michelle: Fine, you got me. You got me. I thought if I was here, maybe, that I could...",
        "Danny: No.",
        "Michelle: But I could.",
        "Danny: No-no-no. No. \"No\" really means no. Honey, I have to find my own way with your dad. Okay? Oh, and look at that. If you leave right now, you'll be just in time for your shift.",
        "Michelle: You know, you timed it this way, didn't you?",
        "Danny: You bet I did.",
        "Michelle: Mm.",
        "Danny: Meet you later, for lunch, around 1:00 if you'd like. We can catch up then-- but not a minute sooner.",
        "Michelle: Or what?",
        "Danny: Or I'll have to... I don't know, I'll have to think of some way to punish you.",
        "Michelle: Don't tempt me, because I might just skip my shift.",
        "Danny: Hold on a second. The mayor's here. I've got to go. I've got to go. Wish me luck.",
        "Michelle: I do, I do. In both meetings, okay? Bye.",
        "Danny: Mr. Mayor? Danny Santos.",
        "Mayor: It's good to put a face to the name.",
        "Danny: Well, actually, we did meet once before a few years ago. When you ran for City Council, I made a contribution.",
        "Mayor: And I sent it back. That was a different time, very different. And I'm going to make sure that that time never comes again.",
        "Danny: I'm not sure what you mean.",
        "Mayor: This is Ralph Stevens. I gave him a call once I finished talking to you.",
        "Danny: Mr. Stevens. Yeah, I'm guessing that you're not here to discuss the Fifth Street project.",
        "Mayor: He's with the FBI.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Can you tell me what's missing from this picture?",
        "Man: We made all the changes you requested. It's perfect.",
        "Edmund: No, it's not. But it will be.",
        "Man: Sir, you wanted the program to go to print today.",
        "Edmund: Yes, I know, and it will. I just want to add something to it. This is a speech. It's from a speech my brother made when he was sworn in for President. I've been looking for something to close out the program. I've realized this is it.",
        "Man: And who will be reading it?",
        "Edmund: I will be.",
        "Man: Of course, sir. Is there anything else?",
        "Edmund: No, I think we're finally on track. So, I'll call you about the program. \"Today our country takes a step for freedom. I'm a lucky man. I've been blessed with the honor of leading you for many years. But I've never been more fortunate than today because now you have chosen me to lead you. I will do everything in my power to honor that trust.\"",
        "Cassie: Don't you say another word, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: And a very good morning to you, too, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Isn't there something that tells you when you've gone too far?",
        "Edmund: You know, I think I might be able to ask you the same thing.",
        "Cassie: Those are Richard's words. That's his inaugural speech. Wait a minute. Are you... Do you plan on reading that at the fund-raiser?",
        "Edmund: Yes, I do.",
        "Cassie: So, what? Did you think that if you said it enough, that if you practiced enough, that you could do it justice? Well, you can't. There's not enough practice in the world for that. That was written from a place of sincerity and truth. That's where Richard lived, and you can never get there, not ever. And I think it's time that you realized that. Do you understand, Edmund?",
        "Edmund: Enough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Mr. Mayor, I came here in good faith. Mr. Stevens, why are you here? Are you here to check me out, or are you just here to frisk me before I could have a sit-down with the mayor?",
        "Stevens: Oh, I did check to make sure your interests in the Fifth Street project were exactly as you described them, which they are.",
        "Mayor: But I called him in on another matter.",
        "Danny: Uh, which is what?",
        "Mayor: To fill me in on the fugitive you delivered to the Feds. You turned. And it gave Stevens and his friends at the FBI enough evidence to indict ten other cases. That goes a long way towards cleaning up Fifth Street and your family's reputation.",
        "Danny: So you're saying that I have your support?",
        "Mayor: A few weeks ago, if anyone said that Fifth Street could be brought back, I would have laughed. Now it's a distinct possibility. Anyone who can do something like that-- and really do it-- the City considers a friend.",
        "Danny: Well, that's... that's great. Really great. Thank you. And if the rest of my day can go this well, I'll be a happy man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Wow. Totally back to normal. I'm serious. You would never even know.",
        "Harley: That I died and went to Heaven? Thanks. No, the truth... You know, I had a lot of people pulling for me, and I did have a lot of help coming back.",
        "Michelle: I know I shouldn't ask this, but was some of that help from above? I'm sorry. You know, see, one of the nurses overheard Frank talking to Rick,",
        "Harley: No, I... I don't mind. I... Yeah, I saw my mother. Plain as day, I saw her. And the truth is, I wouldn't be sitting here now if it hadn't been for her, so... There. (Laughs nervously) Now, you can give me all of your medical jargon about how it's my mind compensating for the trauma that was taking place in my body...",
        "Michelle: I believe you.",
        "Harley: You do, really?",
        "Michelle: Yeah. Because, actually, the same thing happened to me.",
        "Harley: It did? When?",
        "Michelle: Well, it wasn't a life-or-death situation like yours. It only felt like it was, because it was right when I was getting out of high school, and it just... Everything that was happening to me just seemed like it was just the beginning, you know? Actually, it seemed like the end of the world. And I guess my mom agreed, because she came to me. Whenever I was lost or scared, she... she was there, just to talk to me. She gave me advice. She just helped me work things through, you know? I didn't mean to upset you. I just thought maybe it would feel good to know that you weren't alone.",
        "Harley: No, I'm not... I didn't... No, it's great. It's great to talk about it with somebody who understands, because I don't.",
        "Michelle: You don't what?",
        "Harley: I don't understand. I mean, she... What she... she helped me and then, what, she's just gone and that's it?",
        "Michelle: You miss her.",
        "Harley: I know that my mother came back to help me. Okay, I get that. But I just feel like, I don't know, like I should be getting more from this. I mean, it's the biggest thing that's ever happened to me, you know? Shouldn't I, um, change? Shouldn't I learn something from this? What is... What was my mother giving me?",
        "Michelle: Harley, she's giving you your second chance. It's the one you don't waste.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: It's a little weird, isn't it?",
        "Buzz: You think?",
        "Gus: I don't know, what do you think?",
        "Buzz: You know, you just point and shoot. That's all you do, you just point and shoot. Just basic stuff. Just point, shoot.",
        "Gus: Kind of like I did with your daughter, right?",
        "Buzz: (Laughs) Are you feeling too guilty to take me on, huh? I mean, let's get your game on. Hey, hey, hey. Come on.",
        "Gus: Nice.",
        "Buzz: Is your game off? Your game is off. What, what am I looking at here? I mean, this isn't even my game. Either you're the worst basketball player in the world or your head isn't in it. Where are you in this? Huh? Come here. What's-keeping you? What's keeping you from taking me on?",
        "Gus: Hey, come on.",
        "Buzz: I got it. I got it! Maybe... maybe you can't think straight because you're worried that having the Spaulding name is going to get in between you and my daughter.",
        "Gus: Huh? Hey, well...",
        "Buzz: No? So you tell me: When you first came to town, you weren't exactly the poster boy for honesty, were you? You were a dirty FBI agent. You were a dirty FBI agent. You used your badge for a personal vendetta. You couldn't make a friend to save your life.",
        "Gus: Yeah, except for your daughter.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, except for her. But that's not how you turned things around, right?",
        "Gus: It's because of your daughter.",
        "Buzz: No! Because of you!",
        "Gus: No, because of your daughter!",
        "Buzz: Because of you. The only place to go was up. And you made a good start.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: I think I'm going to have a drink.",
        "Alan: And I think I'm going to join you. What?",
        "Alexandra: Well, do you really think you should on an empty stomach, Alan?",
        "Alan: I think it's a great idea.",
        "Alexandra: (Laughs) You know, the figures from the annual report are on the desk if you would care to take a look at them.",
        "Alan: And here I thought you were keeping everything Spaulding away from my prying eyes. By the way, I am aware that you've been taking out the business section in the morning paper.",
        "Alexandra: Well, all right, darling. Maybe it's time you made a fresh start, okay?",
        "Alan: You know, I think that's a good idea. I will have a look. Where is the damn thing?",
        "Alexandra: Alan, if it's not on the desk, it's probably in the file cabinet.",
        "Alan: Then why didn't you tell me in the first place?",
        "Alexandra: Look, I've already gone over the figures. They look fine, Alan. Besides, it's not really important anymore. You're back to your old self.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: (Grunts) Oh, God.",
        "Gus: Uh-huh.",
        "Buzz: That's what I'm talking about.",
        "Gus: (Coughs) What did you say, there's no place to go but... but what do you think? Oh, yeah, loser takes the ball. Go ahead.",
        "Buzz: You know, there was a time when your popularity, sort of was like with Edmund Winslow.",
        "Gus: Oh, that's nice. Ouch.",
        "Buzz: (Laughs) But now...",
        "Gus: But now? Now I've got my own fan club, right? I've got the Gus bus. Let me tell you something, being a Spaulding isn't even a step up for me. I mean, you know what those people are all about.",
        "Buzz: Oh, yes, I do.",
        "Gus: Yes, you do. So, what's your problem?",
        "Buzz: Well, you know, you think of why you found out about your dear old dad now instead of when you first came to town?",
        "Gus: Someone was playing a lousy joke on me.",
        "Buzz: Or maybe it was a lucky break. I mean, what would have happened if the old Gus had found out? What would have happened then? Now you're prepared for whatever the Spaulding's have in store. Hm? I mean, look at you. Look at you. It's huge. What are you thinking about? You're thinking about how it's going to affect my daughter. (Laughs) That's progress.",
        "Gus: The thing is, being a Spaulding, first of all, don't you think they've done enough to her? I don't want to be a Spaulding. I am one now, okay?",
        "Buzz: Hey, check, check. You are no more a Spaulding than I am. You're an okay guy.",
        "Gus: (Grunts) Thank you. Thank you, I think. (Grunts) I cannot...",
        "Buzz: You decide who you are and how you're going to live your life. Look at me. I'm a Cooper. I'm synonymous with-- what?-- Good hardworking people. I walk... It was in my nature. Do you know what I'm talking about?",
        "Gus: No, I don't understand a word that you're saying, all right? Let me ask you this: What if it's in my nature, all the bad things that I did before I got to town and when I first got here. What if that's my nature? My Spaulding nature? Huh, what then? What if it's just a matter of time until-- boom! What then?",
        "Buzz: You don't need the Spaulding name for an excuse to be a jerk. Maybe it's fate. Maybe it happened now because they need you.",
        "Gus: No... (Laughs) I've got nothing to offer them, okay? The only thing I've got to offer is the old man has another heart attack when he finds out I'm his long-lost son.",
        "Buzz: (Laughs) I'd love to see his face.",
        "Gus: Incidentally, I... I am Alan's worst nightmare, okay.",
        "Buzz: And he's yours.",
        "Gus: Yeah, well, you know. Finding out the fact that you're the son of Satan, that's not exactly your dream. Trust me when I tell you, we've got nothing to offer each other. Nothing.",
        "Buzz: Who knows? Who knows?",
        "Gus: \"Who knows?\" What does that mean? What do you mean with the \"who knows?\"",
        "Buzz: You've been working real hard to make yourself a decent person, right? So spread the wealth. Set an example for your family. And when you do, watch your back. They play dirty.",
        "Gus: So do you, my friend.",
        "Buzz: How about another?",
        "Gus: (Sighs)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Thanks for meeting me here, Ed. I know we really haven't seen each other since Michelle and I got back together.",
        "Ed: No, we haven't.",
        "Danny: It's something I'd like to change. And it's really important for Michelle, that she's close to her family, and it's important to me.",
        "Ed: Danny, I know you want me to make this easy on you, but I can't.",
        "Danny: You can't? Or you won't?",
        "Ed: Won't. So if that's why you invited me down here...",
        "Danny: No. Well, it's not the only reason. I do have some business I want to discuss with you.",
        "Ed: Okay, let's do that. Let's get down to business. Okay? (Clears throat)",
        "Danny: All right. Okay. I heard Michelle talking to you on the phone the other day about that kid you treated?",
        "Ed: I'm sorry, I treat a lot of kids. I don't know...",
        "Danny: The one that... The one who was turned away from the hospital.",
        "Ed: Oh. Yeah, unfortunately, insurance is getting to be kind of a luxury these days. I'm glad he came to me.",
        "Danny: I know. Ray's told me a lot about it, and I know that there are a lot of people in the Fifth Street neighborhood who probably have never even seen an insurance policy. I think what you're doing is terrific and necessary, but have you considered that maybe the clinic is too far away for the people who really need it the most?",
        "Ed: We can't move the clinic.",
        "Danny: No, that's not... No, what I'm proposing, actually, is a mobile clinic. A kind of clinic-on-the-go, whatever you want to call it. A mobile unit that would be fully supplied with everything you need so that you or your team members could make a few runs a week to the Fifth Street area.",
        "Ed: A lot of cities have a program like that.",
        "Danny: I know, and they're very successful.",
        "Ed: It takes time and money.",
        "Danny: I got both.",
        "Ed: It also takes commitment. Look, I've read about what you want to do with Fifth Street, and it sounds terrific on paper. But as far as my involvement goes, you don't want to spread yourself too thin. You know, you're going to end up disappointing somebody or disappointing everybody.",
        "Danny: Are we talking about Fifth Street or are we talking about Michelle?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Let go of me.",
        "Edmund: That is exactly what I need you to do.",
        "Cassie: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Edmund: It means you don't want me to become a better person because you need to keep on hating me.",
        "Cassie: Why is that, Edmund?",
        "Edmund: Because then things, at least in part, stay the same. Everything's changing, Cassie. Your kids are growing up, hotel's up and running. Everything is changing. But at least maybe you can still love Richard and you can still hate me.",
        "Cassie: That's insane. Those two things have absolutely nothing to do with each other.",
        "Edmund: Oh, yes, they do. You like absolutes, Cassie. My efforts to make myself a better person just upset your sense of world order, and so you hate me all the more.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Well, that theory only works if you're making progress, and I don't know if you are. But you're crazy to think that if you read those words, you're going to be anything like Richard or that you're going to make something up to him.",
        "Edmund: I don't. I don't. You're right. Cassie, I prepared my remarks and I realized very quickly they weren't nearly enough for Richard. I wanted to do something, I wanted to say something that could truly honor the man. And aside from getting you to be able to come to the gala event, I... I haven't been able to do that. But reading... reading his speech, I feel at least that I'm getting closer.",
        "Cassie: It's a very nice speech.",
        "Edmund: \"It's a very...\" (Laughs)... \"It's a very nice speech\"? Cassie, what he wrote is so far from my experience. He cared for people. He felt so much for people he didn't even know. I don't know how to do that. I think I'd like to learn.",
        "Cassie: Do you think that now you can?",
        "Edmund: I don't know. But I think he's teaching me. I know that sounds crazy, but I... I really believe it. Cassie, you have Richard in a way that I... I just don't. You're able to hold on to him, knowing that you loved him unconditionally, with all of your heart. I... I just don't think I ever did. This is... This is my one chance to love and honor my brother, and I'm going to take it. So if... if reading his speech is going to keep you from coming to the gala, then I'm sorry, I'm truly sorry about that, because I would really like you to be there. But I'm going to read his words. And then I'm going to try to live by them.",
        "Cassie: We've gone over this before, Edmund. I don't own Richard and I don't own his memory. And I think that you wanting to better yourself is great. I've told you that. I just heard you reading those words and I snapped, okay? I just lost it.",
        "Edmund: Well, I was going to tell you about it.",
        "Cassie: And if I asked you not to read it?",
        "Edmund: I'd read them anyway.",
        "Cassie: You just... You don't get it, do you?",
        "Edmund: Well, apparently there are a whole lot of things that I don't...",
        "Cassie: You think about yourself before you think of anyone else. That's what makes you different from everyone.",
        "Edmund: Face it, Cassie, most people do it that way.",
        "Cassie: No, they don't. No, they don't. And you know what? Until you change that part of yourself, you're still the same person. It's just now you know it.",
        "Edmund: Well, I guess knowledge is at least a part. Maybe I can start to change.",
        "Cassie: Maybe. And maybe not.",
        "Edmund: Okay, then, what do I do to become a real, live boy?",
        "Cassie: You know, it's not that easy.",
        "Edmund: I know, I know.",
        "Cassie: Most people have people that they love more than themselves, people they would do anything for, Edmund. You know? I have my children and I have my friends. And I know this is going to sound corny, but you... you need to learn to love.",
        "Edmund: Well, I've loved.",
        "Cassie: I don't mean romantic love, and I don't mean a love that makes you feel good. Loving someone enough to want to make them feel good. That's how Richard lived, Edmund. That's who he was. You know, until you learn to do that, those are just words on a piece of paper.",
        "Edmund: Cassie?",
        "Cassie: Yeah?",
        "Edmund: I hope my reading this speech won't keep you from coming to the gala.",
        "Cassie: I don't know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ed: See, what you're proposing for the clinic, it's exactly what Fifth Street needs. And I'll be straight with you, I wouldn't mind being involved in something like that. But, Danny, if I have to rely on you, it's...",
        "Danny: What? Are you... Ed, what are you saying, that you can't do that? Why? Because of what happened with me and Michelle?",
        "Ed: You broke my daughter's heart, and I had to stand there and do nothing about it, and now you've mended it again, and I don't know why. It's got to be luck or chance or pure willpower.",
        "Danny: It's love, actually.",
        "Ed: All right, let's get back to what... To the proposal. See, I don't know which Danny I'd be getting.",
        "Danny: You'd be getting the one who sees things through to the end.",
        "Ed: Okay, then prove it. Give me some specs. Talk to me about money. Give me everything you have, and I want you to understand something: I am not going to disappoint people down here. If we are going to do this, then we're going to do it right.",
        "Danny: I agree. I agree. I've got it all here for you to look at. So we... we have a deal?",
        "Ed: Yeah. Yeah, we have a deal.",

        "Alan: What is this place?",
        "Alexandra: I told you in the car, Alan, we were going to the hospital.",
        "Alan: Hospital? I'm not sick.",
        "Alexandra: Well, of course, you're not. Now, I have to go find your room, Alan, and I just have to speak to the doctor who's going to check you out.",
        "Alan: I don't like this place.",
        "Alexandra: Alan, it won't be much longer now, I promise you. You stay with him.",
        "Lloyd: He seemed a lot better this morning, didn't he?",
        "Alexandra: Apparently it just comes and goes, all right? I'll be right back.",
        "Lloyd: All right, sir. How you doing? You... you look a little tired.",
        "Alan: Actually, I'm thirsty.",
        "Lloyd: Oh, well, I could get you something.",
        "Alan: Scotch and soda?",
        "Lloyd: Let's just make it a soda, huh? Not that you would notice any difference.",

        "Danny: Oh, look at that.",
        "Michelle: How are my two favorite men...",
        "Danny: Right on time.",
        "Michelle: ...Getting along?",
        "Ed: Danny was making me an offer I couldn't refuse. A mobile clinic. We'd reach more patients that way.",
        "Michelle: That's great, Dad.",
        "Ed: I hope so.",
        "Michelle: Well, it couldn't make me happier, you two working together.",
        "Danny: You know what? I have to go fill Cassie in on a few things. Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back. Hey, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Danny: Whoa. If looks could kill. I hope that's not about me. What's the matter?",
        "Cassie: Edmund. Edmund.",
        "Danny: Of course. What'd he do now?",
        "Cassie: That's the problem. He's doing everything right, and that scares the hell out of me.",

        "Edmund: Richard, you really did know your stuff didn't you? \"I was born loving this country. This journey taking us to freedom is not something I was prepared for. It's something that I learned along the way. Fortunately, I didn't have to go it alone. I had the love of a woman, the finest woman I'd ever known, my beloved Cassie. She is the reason I'm able to be here with you today.\" He had the love of a woman, the finest woman he'd ever known.",

        "Harley: What is going on? Where have you been? You know, one second you're pulling Gus and the I.A. guy out of here. The next you come back all sweaty?",
        "Buzz: Well, I...",
        "Harley: Where's Gus? Is he alive?",
        "Buzz: I was letting him blow off steam on the basketball court. He'll recover eventually.",
