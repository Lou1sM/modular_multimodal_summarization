        "Jeffrey: Well, you're not calling the shots, danny.",
        "Danny: You want me to bring down the mob, I'll do it. But I am not lying to my wife.",
        "Jeffrey: You're not lying to wife. You've already lied to your wife, danny. Construction, sanitation. Does that ring a bell?",
        "Danny: You know what? Those... those arrangements...",
        "Jeffrey: Were arrangements that you made. Knowing full well what they meant.",
        "Danny: I can't go back into the mob and expect michelle to just stand by me.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, then you might have to consider letting her walk.",
        "Danny: No. No way. We'll do this together.",
        "Jeffrey: That's not a good idea.",
        "Danny: O'neill, michelle and I have been through a lot together and we could get through this. But if I start lying to her, I'll kill my marriage.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, do you want to kill her?",
        "Danny: No.",
        "Jeffrey: Do you want her to die? Because that's the risk you'll be running if you tell her.",
        "Danny: I'm giving you what you want. Don't push it.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, let's say you tell her. What if michelle slips up? What happens to her then? What happens to your kid then?",
        "Danny: It's your job to protect my family.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, my job gets a little harder, danny, if you tell her. As matter of fact it gets impossible.",

        "Danny: That's what you told me.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I thought you'd keep your mouth shut.",

        "Harley: Well, can you talk to the guy another time? What about tomorrow?",

        "Eden: You're just like dad, nicky. All the times he was called away from family dinners, I never liked it, but I guess it was always really important. You have to admire that, right, harley? Nicky doing his job really well.",

        "Harley: Bye.",
        "Gus: You behave yourself, you hear me?",
        "Eden: I will try. But she gets to me sometimes, okay?",
        "Gus: Fine. Just order a lot of wine, okay. Has vinnie salerno been in touch with you?",
        "Eden: No, he's been quiet. Too quiet.",
        "Gus: All right.",
        "Eden: Nicky, where are you really going?",

        "(Eden harley): More wine.",
        "Nico: So, mr. Winslow, you've been a big help to joey. I mean with women and stuff.",
        "Edmund: Well, I think joey gives me a little too much credit.",
        "Joey: Crazy. If it wasn't for edmund who came in, we would not be together right now. Oh, I got to call her.",
        "Edmund: I think she's preparing for your arrival. I don't heard a hairdryer coming out of her room down stairs.",
        "Nico: I'm going to get the car. It'll be a lot quicker.",
        "Joey: Okay. Because if tammy came down stairs and you were here, it would totally blow the surprise.",
        "Nico: I'm going to be outside. Look don't get lost, all right. Hey, mr. Winslow, now I know where to come for women advice.",
        "Edmund: Well, I'll b happy to help anytime.",
        "Nico: Thanks.",
        "Edmund: See you, nico.",
        "Nico: Later.",
        "Joey: He could use your help. I've been with him when he's trying to get with a girl.",
        "Edmund: Let me guess. Just a little too attentive, right?",
        "Joey: You got it. You know, you could actually do this for a living. Have your own realty tv show called \"the prince of matchmaking.\"",
        "Edmund: (Laughs) that's frightening. You know, joey, you did very well with lizzie yesterday. I wanted to tell you that.",
        "Joey: Thanks.",
        "Edmund: She needed a friend, you were there for her.",
        "Joey: Well, I know tammy's sick of dealing with her. Well, lizzie could be a lot of work sometimes.",
        "Edmund: Well, you stepped up to the plate. It was a very good thing you did.",
        "Joey: Thanks. You know, I don't mind lizzie as much as some people do. You know, she's had a rough life in some ways.",
        "Joey: Well, I guess money isn't everything, right?",
        "Edmund: No, it is not.",
        "Joey: Well, I just hope tammy realizes that I was just doing it for her as much as I like helping out lizzie.",
        "Edmund: Yeah, I think she realizes that.",
        "Joey: Yeah. I don't know. She seemed kind of mad at me towards the end of the night. Very distracted.",
        "Edmund: Well, you're going to have to ask her about that. But she didn't seem distracted to me. It doesn't hurt to show a little concern.",
        "Joey: Yeah. I mean, it works for you with mrs. Winslow and everything?",
        "Edmund: Well, nothing's fool proof. And god's know I've been a fool in the course of my life. But it's best I think to air on the side of concern.",
        "Joey: Well, I'd better call upstairs. If I leave nico any longer, he's going to start parking cars or something.",
        "Edmund: Boy's night out?",
        "Joey: No, not really. Just helping me with a surprise for...",
        "Tammy: What's up?",
        "Joey: Tammy. Honey. (Laughs)",
        "Tammy: Joey, what is going on? You look so freaked. Are you two keeping secrets?",
        "Jeffrey: Danny, you know as well as I do the way to keep everyone safer is to keep michelle in the dark.",
        "Danny: You don't understand something. It won't work. Michelle knows me too well.",
        "Jeffrey: All right, why don't you just paint a bullseye on her forehead?",
        "Danny: No, o'neill, you've already done that. So if I'm in danger, my family's in danger.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, the danger gets greater if she knows what's going on.",
        "Danny: You can't separate me from my wife and my kid.",
        "Jeffrey: Do you understand what this is going to require from michelle?",
        "Danny: I'm not changing my mind.",
        "Jeffrey: Do you know the toll that she's going to be put under on? Being on 24/7 day after day?",
        "Danny: Michelle is a lot stronger than you think. We could do a hell of a lot worse.",
        "Jeffrey: I know why, danny. I know why you want to tell her.",
        "Danny: Why?",
        "Jeffrey: You figure at least she'll be by your side when things get ugly. And they are going to get ugly. And you think that' a good thing. But it's not, danny. It's a bad thing. You've got to stop thinking with your heart and start thinking with your head.",
        "Danny: I'm not going to lie to her.",
        "Jeffrey: Don't you think you're being a little bit selfish?",
        "Danny: The last time I did something like this, michelle divorced me and I almost lost her for good.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, what can i say, danny? She might hate you, but at least she'll be alive. Are you going back to the beacon?",
        "Danny: Yeah. Why?",
        "Jeffrey: Good. I want to show you something.",
        "Marah: Okay, why are you guys looking at me like that?",
        "Michelle: We're happy for you. We are. It's just that a few days ago...",
        "Marah: I was a basket case. I know. I know. But you know what? I'M... I'm better now and appreciate your concern, but...",
        "Michelle: You know, you've been through a lot, marah, and nobody expects you to heal over night.",
        "Marah: All right, you guys, I'm not living in some dream world, okay. Did I think that carrie was going to win? Yes, for awhile I did. But she didn'T.",
        "Marina: Going to paris is great. But what changed?",
        "Marah: I went back to the fairgrounds and finally carrie became clear to me.",
        "Marina: How?",
        "Marah: I saw all of her cheap tricks, you know, and she didn't seem so scary anymore. She just seemed psychotic. Yeah. I'm just glad I realized it before it was too late.",
        "Marina: Yeah, but what if she isn't? I mean our wishes did come true. You know, shayne's walking, looks like danny's going to be the next mayor and you're going off into the sunset with jeffrey.",
        "Michelle: Oh, marah, oh, please tell me you're not being serious, please?",

        "Drug dealer: Have I let you down, yet?",

        "Drug dealer: Okay, I'll knock off 40.",
        "Gus: And it's pure? That's what you got, some sort of direct pipeline to the source?",
        "Drug dealer: There you go with the questions again.",
        "Gus: I want to know if my money's just as good as anybody else! Like you, I want to know who I'm dealing with and what I'm getting? Is that a crime?",
        "Drug dealer: You want to make the deal or not?",
        "Gus: $40.",
        "Drug dealer: Good talking to you.",
        "Tammy: You both look very guilty. You might as well confess now or I might have to use torture.",
        "Edmund: Oh, the arrogance of it all, I have no idea what she's talking about.",

        "Edmund: He is a very nice young man.",
        "Tammy: He tries really hard. Well, I guess I'm in for the evening. How about you?",
        "Michelle: Marina, you can not be serious.",
        "Marina: I don't believe in the ring. You know that part of me that wanted to, I feel like I've lost that. I kind of want it back.",
        "Marah: Well, we've all lost part of ourselves, but I don't know, I guess that's part of growing up.",
        "Marina: Is that suppose to be our big lesson from this experience?",
        "Michelle: Possibly.",

        "Marina: I think we sound like a support group.",
        "Marah: We survived.",
        "Michelle: Yeah. You know what? We did.",
        "Marina: Yeah.",
        "Michelle: Thank god. And I am glad that you put all of this behind you.",

        "Jeffrey: You want a drink or something?",
        "Danny: You said you wanted to show me something.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. Well... I said that you had to protect michelle. This is why. Her name is rebecca.",
        "Danny: Let me guess. You are in love with her.",
        "Jeffrey: We graduated top of our class. First and second officers training.",

        "Jeffrey: So that you'll see.",
        "Danny: What? See what?",
        "Jeffrey: Danny, we were working a job. It was the russian mob. It was deep undercover, but not deep enough. They caught her. They held her for a couple of weeks. They tried to break her. They tried to get her to talk, but she wouldn't give me up. Do you know why? Because of me, because she loved me.",
        "Danny: That wouldn't happen.",
        "Jeffrey: That wouldn't happen?",
        "Danny: Nope.",
        "Jeffrey: Michelle loves you in the very same way, danny.",
        "Danny: We are going to protect her, aren't we?",
        "Jeffrey: What if we fail? What if salerno's people get a hold of her?",
        "Danny: We can't let that happen.",
        "Jeffrey: If she doesn't know anything, they'll know that. And maybe they'll spare her. But if she does know something...",
        "Danny: We won't fail.",
        "Jeffrey: If she does know something, danny, they going to go at her and they're not going to stop until...",
        "Danny: No, don'T. Don't even say it.",
        "Jeffrey: Danny, think about! These people don't care that she's a woman, or that she's a mother. All they care about is that she's your wife! And she will pay the price.",
        "Danny: No she won'T.",
        "Jeffrey: I don't beg. Danny, this is the closest I'm ever going to come. Keep her out of it. Michelle loves you enough to die for you, danny. Do you love enough to die?",
        "Rick: That's right, things are looking pretty darn good in bauer land.",
        "Mel: So leah and I do have a part in all this joy?",
        "Rick: Sweetheart, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't even be here.",
        "Mel: Okay, let's not get carried away.",

Honey, I'm so blessed. They have brought me so much joy, words can't even express. And you know how much I want a happy family. That's all I ever wanted. It looks like it's finally going to happen.",
        "Tammy: I wonder where mom is.",

        "Tammy: So I guess we're both on our own.",
        "Edmund: Yes, I guess we are. You know what? I think I'm going to grab a bite to eat and then catch up on some much missed reading.",
        "Tammy: Oh, speaking of reading...",
        "Edmund: Hey, \"othello.\"",
        "Tammy: Well, I figured since we're almost finished with \"romeo and juliet,\" I'd pick out the next play I want to study.",
        "Edmund: Well, it's one of my favorites.",
        "Tammy: Well since you said you've worked on it at school, i thought maybe you could help me out if I have any trouble with it. I actually have a few questions if you have any time.",

        "Eden: Oh, have I?",
        "Bill: Will you stop it? Now, are you ready to order? And no more wine.",
        "Harley: I think we should wait for gus.",
        "Eden: Me, too.",
        "Bill: Fine. You know what, we'll wait for gus. He's the only reason you guys are here anyway.",
        "Harley: He is.",

        "Harley: Feeling's mutual, sister .",
        "Bill: Yeah, see now, there you go again. You both love the guy, so why don't you just bury the hatchet? And I'm not talking in one another's back either.",

        "Harley: I take that as a compliment.",
        "Eden: Okay. We're trying to be nice here, right?",
        "Harley: Yes.",
        "Eden: Okay. Let's go all the way.",

        "Harley: I don't know what to say. I could do that.",
        "Eden: What?",
        "Harley: I could be your maid of honor.",

        "Bill: Yeah, well where is he anyway, huh?",
