Oh, you shouldn't have. I'll go put them in some water, cass.", "Cassie: It's a long story. A really long story.", "Jeffrey: So what's she doing here?", "Dinah: She has a name. And to answer your question, i'm living here now.", "Cassie: It's true.", "Dinah: Would you like to tell him or should I?", "Cassie: I'd like for you to deal with the flowers, okay.", "Dinah: Okay.", "Jeffrey: Okay, I know you might be feeling a little lonely, but if you are, get a dog.", "Cassie: You're going to have to have a little more respect for dinah, because she's carrying my child.", "Jeffrey: You've lost me.", "Cassie: Have I? I can't imagine why. I mean it makes perfect sense to me.", "Jeffrey: Cassie, I don'T...", "Cassie: When I found out about edmund starting the fire and I took off, it was right in the middle of our in vitro process if you remember. See my eggs have already been fertilized. They were ready to be implanted. See edmund saw it as a now or never opportunity, or maybe some messed up way of getting me back. So he had my embryos implanted in somebody else.", "Jeffrey: Not her.", "Cassie: Dinah. It's dinah.", "Jeffrey: Is edmund completely insane? What a stupid question. Of course he is. Come here. What are you going to do?", "Cassie: I'm doing it.", "Jeffrey: Dinah marler, the mother of your child?", "Cassie: No, gestational carrier. I'm the mother. That's my egg, my gene, my baby. Okay, look, I... ( Crying ) am i happy about this? No! I can't believe edmund did this. But that's my baby that she's carrying. I mean, it's a baby that i already love, jeffrey.", "Jeffrey: Okay, cassie, now wait a minute. Think about this, okay. Okay. The baby's born then what? You think dinah's just going to hand him or her over to you just like that before she crawls back in her hole?", "Dinah: Oh, do you think i can't hear you?", "Cassie: Edmund made her sign a contract. Okay, it's the only smart thing that he did.", "Jeffrey: A contract? She could have that contested for any number of reasons. I can tell you that as a lawyer.", "Cassie: Don't tell me that.", "Jeffrey: Dinah hates you. She will use this child to torture you. She's has already started.", "Dinah: That's enough, jeffrey. Now I know that you have a thing here for cassie. And I don't know how far it's gone. In fact, i don't want to know. But I think you need to take your selfish needs and put them aside and focus on what's best for this baby. So either you get on the happy train, or you get lost.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: Is mom back at the farm? I haven't gotten in touch with her, but the front desk said you were here.", "Edmund: Yes, tammy, your mother's at the farm and i am here. And we're living separately for the time being while we work things out.", "Tammy: If you could work things out. I've got to go. Sandy.", "Sandy: What's cooking good looking? So, you want to eat here? Or go someplace else like that new place on the beach?", "Tammy: Let's do that, yeah.", "Sandy: All right.", "Jonathan: I said stop calling me!", "Sandy: Telemarketer?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: Of course, yes. I want to marry you. You just caught me off guard there. I mean, I thought it would be a few weeks away.", "Tony: Okay, i'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I feel... You know what? You want to do it someplace else, we can do it anywhere you want. That's fine.", "Michelle: Oh, yeah. Where? What do you got?", "Tony: Let's say towers, your family's backyard. Or outdoors, laurel falls. It's up to you. You know what? Listen. I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm just so excited about this whole thing. I'm throwing it all at you and i apologize. It's whevever you want. Anything you want. Hey.", "Michelle: Mm-hmm.", "Tony: You all right?", "Michelle: Can we talk about this later on tonight?", "Tony: Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, sure.", "Michelle: Okay.", "Tony: Sure. You're taking off, huh?", "Michelle: Yeah.", "Tony: Well, you want to take these with you?", "Michelle: No, no, you hang on to them.", "Tony: Look over them. You sure?", "Michelle: Yeah. I'll see you later. Bye.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: I just... I feel like i can't leave town right now.", "Marina: Because michelle just got her memory back.", "Danny: No, I'm thinking about robbie. He's going to be able to sense that something is different with michelle. And I don't know if it will freak him out. I mean i don't know how he's going to respond. And I just don't want to leave him.", "Marina: Well, i understand, danny, i do. I wasn't trying to be snarky about it.", "Danny: No, you weren'T. You weren'T.", "Marina: It's just that... I was just looking forward to the trip.", "Danny: I was, too.", "Marina: Not just the trip.", "Danny: I know. I know.", "Marina: Just being with you.", "Danny: I was too.", "Marina: Still?", "Danny: Yeah, still.", "Marina: Are you sure? Because...", "Danny: The... Yeah.", "Marina: Here we are, danny. We're standing in the same spot where you married michelle, and she remembers it now. She remembers how much you loved her?", "Danny: Yeah, I know she remembers. But she's marrying tony and... I don't know what to tell you. I'm happy for her.", "Marina: Danny, you don't have to be.", "Danny: Marina. I'm happy for her.", "Marina: Okay. Good. I'm happy for michelle, too. But I'm even more happy for us. Because when we finally do go to chicago, we're going to have an awesome time together.", "Danny: We will. I know we will.", "Marina: We're good for each other, danny. So you do whatever you have to do about michelle. Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.", "Danny: I know you will. I'm sorry. I hope you don't feel like i'm jerking you around. I... Just... I really appreciate you being so understanding and so patient. This will all sort it self out very soon.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: What are you doing here?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: Olivia and emma--", "olivia: I work with alan, remember?", "Alan: For me, olivia.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Can we talk in private?", "Olivia: Yeah. Out here.", "Bill: You didn't come home last night.", "Olivia: Well, you can't be surprised. I mean you cheated on me.", "Bill: That'S... That'S... Look i don't want to fight about this right now.", "Olivia: What? What do you want?", "Bill: I want you to come home. That's what I want.", "Olivia: You should have thought about that before you slept with harley.", "Bill: Well, you should have thought about that before you tried to blackmail my father, sold out lewis construction, turn your back on harley. Should i go on? Look, I'm talking having to forget each other mistakes or even forgive. But wherever, can't we just be there together?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: I'm sorry to intrude, hilda wanted to know if you and emma were happy in your suite, olivia. If not, she'll be happy to move rooms.", "bill: You and emma stayed here last night?", "Alan: Yes, olivia and emma have moved back in. And we are delighted.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: Alan, please.", "Bill: Are you out of your mind?", "Olivia: I needed a roof over my head.", "Bill: You needed a roof. You own a hotel.", "Olivia: It's booked. Look... Besides, this way I can work out of the house and I can spend more time with emma.", "Bill: All right, it's a about emma.", "Olivia: And me. And me.", "Bill: See that's more like it.", "Olivia: Hey, look i chose to live here, because at least here i know were I stand.", "Bill: Yeah, until alan cut you off at the knees.", "Olivia: No, no, we understand each other, he and i. We want the same thing?", "Bill: Oh, what's that? The rule of the world?", "Olivia: What's wrong with that?", "Bill: Oh, please.", "Olivia: No, we want what's best for emma. What's best for spaulding.", "Bill: Okay, olivia. Not the same thing.", "Olivia: Says the guy who bailed on me.", "Bill: I didn'T... Oh, man, i didn't.", "Olivia: You didn't what? You didn't what?", "Bill: Look, the reason I came here was to...", "Olivia: To blame alan for everything's that's gone wrong between us. I got that. But that's not it. It's not his fault. This is about you and me and how we keep hurting each other.", "Bill: Okay, wait a minute. You honestly believe that you would be happier living here with people that would betray you at the drop of a hat?", "Olivia: You could only be betrayed by someone that you trust. At least here no one pretends to love me.", "Bill: I wasn't pretending. Were you?", "Olivia: My daughter needs me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: Bill, i'm really glad you stopped by. Because you have made my day. You stopped by because you have", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "marina: You know I'm really glad we talked about this.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: Thank you.", "Marina: Really. I want us to be honest each other. Always. Even when it's hard.", "Danny: Me, too. How'd I get so lucky to find you?", "Marina: Good question.", "Danny: ( Laughs ) so where's robbie?", "Marina: Oh, mel took the kids to the park for awhile. They should be back soon.", "Danny: Okay.", "Marina: You can hang out for awhile. There's some leftovers in the fridge if you want them.", "Danny: Okay.", "Marina: I have some errands to run. But I will be back later.", "Danny: Okay.", "Marina: Try to do me a favor while I'm gone, okay?", "Danny: What?", "Marina: Don't miss me too much? See ya.", "Danny: See you later. To love honor and cherish.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: I do.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dinah: I need to get changed for a doctors appointment.", "Jeffrey: I'm speechless.", "Dinah: Yeah. I know the feeling. Look, I know it's not going to be easy dealing with dinah through this pregnancy.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: Oh, you don't think so? You don't think it's going to be easy.", "Cassie: What other choice do i have?", "Jeffrey: Okay, listen. I'm trying to understand and i understand that. But you really want her to move in here with you?", "Cassie: Yes, I want her to live here. Because I want to make sure she's taking care of herself and my baby. Plus, I want to make sure she doesn't have any room to pull anything.", "Jeffrey: Oh, and you think living here is going to stop her? Look, I'm sorry. I... I just didn't... I didn't expect this.", "Cassie: Surprise.", "Jeffrey: You know, cassie, you keep talking about this baby, and how it's going to be your baby and how you're going to take care of it. But you know there is another part of the equation here you're forgetting about.", "Cassie: Edmund.", "Jeffrey: Yeah. The father, cassie.", "Cassie: I don't even want to see him right now. He's done enough. I'm taking over. I'm doing it.", "Jeffrey: Okay. Good for you. I guess I'd better get going. You know, you're going to need someone on your side.", "Cassie: Thank you. Thank you for everything. Thank you for the other night. And for letting me sleep in your t-shirt.", "Jeffrey: Not just any t-shirt. That was a van halen t-shirt. Vintage. Well, that was fun.", "Cassie: Yeah, it was fun.", "Jeffrey: But a lot has changed since that night. So i'll see you later.", "Cassie: Wait. Not everything's changed, jeffrey.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marina: Coming up on \"guiding light\"...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: You get to perjure yourself for harley, you get to build houses for, you even get to sleep with her ( laughs ) and i have to be a saint or selfish?", "Bill: No, listen to me.", "Olivia: I have to give up everything that I've worked long and hard for. You have to give up nothing. That is no deal for, bill.", "Bill: That's no deal.", "Olivia: No.", "Bill: Oh, there it is. There it is. There's that shark that I fell in love with.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: And there's something going on between us. And I don't want deny it. I'm just really confused.", "Jeffrey: You're not confused. You know exactly what you want. And I want the same thing.", "Cassie: These past few weeks have been crazy. And I'm going to be a mom... Again. And I have a housemate from hell. But you're here. And there's something going on between us and i don't want to deny it. I'm just really confused.", "Jeffrey: No, you're not. You're not confused. You know exactly what you want. And I want the same thing.", "Dinah: Cassie? You ready?", "Cassie: In a minute.", "Jeffrey: The doctor, huh?", "Cassie: Dr. Sedwick at cedars.", "Jeffrey: Mind if I tag along? I'd like to talk to this doctor myself about this pregnancy. Besides, the last time you two were in a car together, it didn't work out to well, did it?", "Dinah: Sure. Whatever suits you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sandy: So who called?", "Jonathan: It doesn't matter.", "Tammy: It seems like it does. I know you're ticked off. But the question is, what are you going to do about it?", "Jonathan: Why do you even care?", "Sandy: Tammy...", "Tammy: You saved my life. Which makes you closer to even. Reva's out of town; you don't have any real friends. Why not talk to us?", "Jonathan: You want to know what's going on with me? I'm fed up with this uptight town. I'm fed up with the two of you and I'm leaving springfield for good.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: Did olivia tell you about the little song that emma made up this morning? It was absolutely adorable. I wish you could have heard it.", "Bill: Is emma all right?", "Olivia: Yeah, she went back to sleep.", "Bill: All right. Can we talk? I mean really talk about getting you and emma back home? Please?", "Olivia: Alan, can we have a moment, please?", "Alan: Sure. I've got some files I need to look at. Oh, I made a mistake. Olivia, this file is for you.", "Bill: Wait a minute. This says lewis construction.", "Alan: Yes, I'm lightening my work load, bill. And certain duties are going to fall to olivia now that she's the new director of mergers and acquisitions. I know you're shocked about this. But I just assumed that you would want the job, olivia.", "Olivia: Sure. Yeah. Why not? I'll take it.", "Bill: Wait a second. What...", "Olivia: What?", "Alan: Now, bill, I know you came over here to warn me about taking over lewis construction, but you're going to have to talk to olivia about that now. Olivia, if you think this is a good company that we should acquire, it's up to you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: Hey. So what's going on?", "Michelle: I just thought I'd come by and spend a little time with robbie.", "Danny: Oh, well, mel took him to the park with jude and leah. But marina says they should be back soon.", "Michelle: Oh, yeah. I keep forgetting that the coopers live here now.", "Danny: Mm-hmm.", "Michelle: Is marina around?", "Danny: Uh-uh. She had to do something.", "Michelle: Doesn't that strike you as kind of funny? Like we're in a parallel universe? You're coming to visit marina here.", "Danny: At your family's house? ( Mock scream )", "michelle: Yeah, and we're both coming to visit robbie here.", "Danny: Yeah, michelle. Everything's kind of backwards.", "Michelle: Yeah. Yeah, everything. So marina's good?", "Danny: Mm-hmm. She's fine. How's tony?", "Michelle: He's great. Tony's great. He's going to drive me crazy with all the wedding plans, though. He's got a zillion ideas for, you know, all these different locations, all over the map.", "Danny: Really? Like where?", "Michelle: Well, the beacon, laurel falls, here.", "Danny: Not very original.", "Michelle: Well, don't worry, I have veto power. I know that wouldn't be appropriate. Tony and i will definitely find someplace personal for us to get married.", "Danny: Yeah. Well, then i guess you and i'd better get divorced first.", "Michelle: Yeah. Well, about that: Tony had the hearing pushed up, so it's... It's actually going to be first thing tomorrow.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tony: Thank you very much, man. Have a good day, all right? Well, well, well. I thought you and danny were off to chicago by now, no?", "Marina: So did I. But plans changed. Danny had some stuff he had to take care of.", "Tony: Really? With what, michelle? Since he's convinced that she's coming back to him now, right?", "Marina: Tony, danny's not interested in michelle anymore. He has moved on.", "Tony: Marina, you keep saying that to me, and I'm not sure why you do, but...", "Marina: He just wants to help her, with robbie and stuff like that.", "Tony: Ah. Well, I'm glad to hear that because michelle and i are getting married. We're planning our wedding as we speak. Okay, what are we going to do? Are we going to sit here and do this song and dance over and over again and play this game? Or, are we going to admit that we're both in the same boat?", "Marina: What boat is that?", "Tony: You know what boat, marina. Oh. Okay, well, I guess it doesn't matter to you that i got danny and michelle's divorce hearing pushed up. Tomorrow morning. Yeah, that's right. You're welcome.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: I didn't make the appointment for myself, dr. Sedwick. Dinah is carrying my child.", "Dinah: And I'm thrilled to pieces to be giving cassie and edmund exactly what they want most in the world.", "Dr. Sedwick: Well, that's a wonderful gift.", "Dinah: It is, i know. I know.", "Cassie: I know how unorthodox this is, and i'm sorry that we're just kind of springing it on you.", "Dr. Sedwick: Babies come into the world all sorts of ways, and i certainly know how hard you and edmund have tried. Oh, will he be joining us?", "Cassie: No. Uh-uh. He has a meeting.", "Dr. Sedwick: Oh. And you're here to...", "Jeffrey: I'm just a friend.", "Dr. Sedwick: Oh. Well, dinah, why don't you come along with me? And I'll be back and let you know when we have everything set up.", "Cassie: Okay. Oh, man.", "Jeffrey: It's going to be a long nine months.", "Cassie: Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. I think the saint dinah is almost as bad as the old dinah.", "Jeffrey: There is no old dinah or new dinah. There's just the same leopard who won't change her spots.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dinah: Thank you. ( Cell phone rings )", "edmund: Hello?", "Dinah: Edmund. You need to be here, now.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "bill: All right, you are going to tell alan that you're not taking this job, olivia.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: No, no. I want the job.", "Bill: You want the job?", "Olivia: Mm-hmm.", "Bill: He just told you to take over my family's company.", "Olivia: No. No, he said it was my call.", "Bill: And that is a test, olivia. It's a test. If you don't take over lewis, then you fail the test. You're disloyal to alan and he gives you the boot. Don't you understand? He gave you that file in front of me because he wants you to choose between us. Don't let him win. Come on, olivia. I want us to win.", "Olivia: On your terms.", "Bill: No, that'S...", "Olivia: Yes! Listen to me. You... You get to perjure yourself for harley, you get to build houses for her, you even get to sleep with her! And I have to be a saint or I'm selfish? I have to give up everything that i have worked long and hard for? You have to give up nothing? That is no deal for me, bill.", "Bill: That's no deal?", "Olivia: No.", "Bill: Oh, there it is. There it is. There's that shark that I fell in love with. So you really want to go up against me on this, huh? Head to head?", "Olivia: And may the best man win.", "Bill: Trust me, i will.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: ( Sighs ) what are you doing here?", "Edmund: Shouldn't i be asking him that question?", "Cassie: Look, jeffrey came by the house and he saw dinah, so i told him what happened.", "Jeffrey: It was a nice stunt, edmund. I'll have to review the case law, see how many you broke this time.", "Edmund: I'm not sure you'd have the time, mr. O'neill. Riding to cassie's rescue every two seconds must be awfully time-consuming.", "Jeffrey: Yeah, like going behind her back. That takes time, too, but you managed to pull it off, right?", "Edmund: I know how much she wanted this child.", "Cassie: Okay, can we please stop? Jeffrey, can you leave? Edmund's the father, and i can cut him out of some things, but not everything, and he has a right to be here. Please.", "Jeffrey: ( Sighs ) all right. Call me if you need me.", "Cassie: I will. I have your cell number. Thank you.", "Edmund: Unbelievable, his bullying his way in here like that.", "Cassie: Bullying would be fertilizing my eggs and implanting them in dinah. That would be bullying.", "Edmund: If you don't want this child, cassie, then tell me.", "Cassie: Well, of course i want the child now, edmund.", "Edmund: Then stop saying i made a mistake.", "Dr. Sedwick: Edmund, I'm so glad you're here. Well, why don't you both come in together, and you can have a look. See that shape right there?", "Edmund: Is that...?", "Dr. Sedwick: Your child.", "Cassie: Oh, my god.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: You're leaving town?", "Sandy: You need help packing?", "Tammy: Sandy.", "Sandy: He's doing the right thing, tammy. And it's about time.", "Jonathan: Gee, thanks. I live for your approval.", "Sandy: You hate it here. You've made that abundantly clear from day one. You can still have a relationship with reva. She can go visit you wherever.", "Jonathan: Yeah, well, not unless she gets her psychic powers back because I'm not telling her where I'm going.", "Tammy: Wait. What? You're not telling reva? What do you mean? She's your mom. You love her.", "Sandy: Let's not get carried away.", "Tammy: And more importantly, she loves you. If you leave her like that, it'll crush her.", "Sandy: Yeah, tammy's right about that. You shouldn't do this to reva.", "Jonathan: Did you ever think maybe my staying would hurt reva? Did you ever think about that?", "Sandy: Let me ask you a question: Has this been the plan from the beginning? You get close to reva, you make her think you care, and then you just rip her heart out and crush her for good? Is that really your master plan?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tony: Okay, come on, marina. You know you want this divorce to go on just as much as i do.", "Marina: Sure, i want the divorce to go on, tony, but that's just because it's what danny wants.", "Tony: And you're sure about that, huh?", "Marina: If you have something to say, just say it.", "Tony: Okay, i will. I don't think that you're as sure of danny's feelings as you say you are, okay? Hey, i think you're a great girl, I think you're beautiful, I think that you would make danny very happy if he really gave you the chance. But the fact is, is that he's so obsessed with michelle, so it doesn't matter.", "Marina: You are the one who's obsessed, tony. And you have to chill, okay, or you're going to ruin your chance for a relationship with michelle.", "Tony: Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something. Michelle and i are fine. We're getting married. Okay? Now, you do your part. Next 24 hours, you keep danny busy. You make sure you show him how good of a person you really are and how good you guys are together. You make sure he shows up at the courthouse, signs the papers, and we go about our happy ending. Okay? Deal, partner?", "Marina: I'm not your partner.", "Tony: Oh, yeah, you are. You just don't want to admit it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: So tomorrow morning we just sign those papers, and then it's official. Oh, man, and two years ago on the fourth of july, we got married right here. Do you remember that day? Do you remember how crazy that was? We were running around trying to find a justice of the peace to marry us. Then we realized we couldn't even go through with it because we needed our friends and family there.", "Danny: Yes, michelle, i remember. ( Laughs )", "michelle: And last fourth of july couldn't have been more opposite. I was so angry.", "Danny: Over an apple pie.", "Michelle: No, i was angry because I couldn't remember things that pele were expecting me to remember. And I... I took it out on you on our anniversary. I'm really, really sorry about that. I'm sorry that i hurt you like that.", "Danny: Hey. In the past.", "Michelle: Yeah. Yeah, we can't really undo the past anyway, right?", "Danny: I guess not.", "Michelle: ( Sighs )", "danny: What, are you cold? You want my coat?", "Michelle: It's all right. I'm fine.", "Danny: No, here. Here, here, here. Take it. Take it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: I hope I didn't cause any trouble between you and bill, olivia, because you don't have to take this job.", "Olivia: You know I want it.", "Alan: Well, i'm delighted to hear that because I think you're going to be perfect in it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Okay, i've had it.
