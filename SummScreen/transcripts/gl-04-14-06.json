        "Ira: So any big changes in your tax return \r\nthis year? ",
        "Harley: You don't read the newspaper much, do \r\nyou? ",
        "Ira: Not much. ",
        "Harley: Okay, well, I started out the year \r\nmaking 50 cents a day because I was in prison, and I ended the year married-- \r\nwhich is good, right?-- Making six figures as a CEO. ",
        "Ira: Oh, all right. Gus? ",
        "Gus: Nope, everything's easy for me. Although \r\nnext year might be a problem because I was legally dead, partially, briefly. Do \r\nI get a tax break for that? ",
        "Ira: I'll have to look that one up. \n",
        "Harley: Anyway, I don't think these um-- \r\nhoney-- these receipts really tell the story of what kind of a year we also \r\nhave. I don't think they also tell you how good it feels to be normal again.\r\n",
        "Gus: Save all of these, though, you know.\r\n",
        "Harley: You okay? ",
        "Gus: What are we talking about? ",
        "Ira: Prison salary. You had quite a year.\r\n",
        "Harley: Yes. I hope to you never have a year \r\nlike that ever again. ",
        "Ira: Look at it this way, now you can handle \r\nanything life throws you. ",
        "Harley: Somehow it doesn't make me feel \r\nbetter. Can we just go back to tax talk? There is stuff everywhere, sweetie.\r\n",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\nMallet: Hey, I know you're upset, and that's understandable. ",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\nFrank: Hey little brother. ",
        "Coop: Hey. ",
        "Frank: Have you seen Harley? ",
        "Coop: No. It's not my day to watch her.\r\n",
        "Frank: That's a good thing because you're too \r\nbusy watching Ava. ",
        "Coop: Okay. ",
        "Frank: Get over here. What are you doing \r\nhere? Get in there and sweep her off her feet. ",
        "Coop: \"Sweep her off her feet.\" Is that \r\nsomething you would say, Frank? ",
        "Frank: Listen, if you don't like her, yeah, \r\nI'd love to sweep her off of her feet. ",
        "Coop: Okay. All right, all right. ",
        "Frank: But you know what? Taking another \r\nman's woman is not exactly my style. ",
        "Coop: Wow. Is there something we need to talk \r\nabout? ",
        "Frank: No. I just need to talk to Harley, is \r\nwhat I need to do. And being that she's not here, I'm out of here. Now, Henry, \r\ngo in there and get the girl. ",
        "Coop: Okay. Thank you, thank you. ",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\nJosh: Now what did that poor rug ever do to you, unless of course you're \r\npretending that it's somebody else. Maybe-- I don't know-- Jeffrey. ",
        "Cassie: How about you and Reva for being such \r\nidiots yesterday. I can't even believe you went through with that divorce.\r\n",
        "Josh: Yes, we did. But then later on we \r\nchanged our minds and we tore up the paperwork! ",
        "Cassie: You did? ",
        "Josh: Yeah. ",
        "Cassie: Really? ",
        "Josh: Yeah. ",
        "Cassie: Josh, that is great news! ",
        "Josh: I'm still your brother- in-law. \n",
        "Cassie: I'm so happy for you. Did I tell you \r\nor did I tell you? ",
        "Josh: You told me. ",
        "Cassie: Where's Reva? We've got to celebrate.\r\n",
        "Josh: Actually, she went to Paris to be with \r\nMarah. That's a good thing, though. She didn't want to disappoint her, change \r\nher plans, you know. And she wanted to give her the good news. But Reva can't \r\nwait to get back and I can't wait to have her back. So, you're going to have to \r\nfind somebody else to beat the crap out of. Maybe Jonathan. ",
        "Cassie: No. I'm turning over a new leaf. I \r\ntold Tammy that I'm going to keep my opinions to myself and I'm going to let her \r\nmake her own decisions, right or wrong. And I am really going to try to stick to \r\nthat. ",
        "Josh: Okay. ",
        "Tammy: Mom? Hi, Uncle Josh. ",
        "Josh: Hey, Tammy. ",
        "Cassie: Hi, honey. I'm so glad to see you.\r\n",
        "Tammy: Oh. I'm going to hang on to that for a \r\nsecond, because you might not feel that way after I ask you this question.\r\n",
        "Cassie: Why, what are you going to ask me?\r\n",
        "Tammy: Um... did you really mean what you \r\nsaid about supporting me and Jonathan? ",
        "Cassie: Support? ",
        "Tammy: How about tolerate? ",
        "Cassie: Better. ",
        "Tammy: Good, because I'm about to put you to \r\nthe test. Isn't it fun being a mom? ",
        "Tammy: Uh-huh. ",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\nLizzie: I will take one of those and a tequila chaser, please. ",
        "Jonathan: How about a soda? ",
        "Lizzie: What's with this chaperone thing?\r\n",
        "Jonathan: I just don't need you getting \r\nsloppy drunk around here. ",
        "Lizzie: Why, are you afraid you won't able to \r\ncontrol yourself? ",
        "Jonathan: What? I told you not to come back \r\nhere. ",
        "Lizzie: What are you so worried about? \n",
        "Jonathan: You left this in my bed, Lizzie. \r\nTammy found it, okay? ",
        "Lizzie: All right. What was I supposed to \r\nsay? Wait a minute, what was Tammy doing in your bed? ",
        "Jonathan: Come on. ",
        "Lizzie: No. ",
        "Jonathan: Goodbye. ",
        "Lizzie: Please tell me you didn't taker back? \r\nWhat about making her beg? What about the restraining order she had against you.\r\n",
        "Jonathan: We settled out of court. \r\nEverything's fine now. Everything is under control. ",
        "Lizzie: Everything except for me. ",

        "Harley: What are you doing? ",
        "Gus: This is stale. The place is going \r\ndownhill. ",
        "Harley: Uh-huh. ",
        "Gus: I just needed to stretch my leg. Where \r\ndid Ira go? ",
        "Harley: I told him that we were going to file \r\nan extension if that's okay. ",
        "Gus: \"Ira.\" ",
        "Harley: Ira, our accountant. ",
        "Gus: I'm okay with an extension. ",
        "Harley: Good. I didn't think we should rush \r\ninto doing our taxes, if we really didn't have to, especially since you're not \r\nfeeling so hot. ",
        "Gus: No. I feel good. ",
        "Harley: Feel good? Is that why you're still \r\npopping these? ",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\nDinah: I want you to be honest with me, okay? Am I widely insecure to be ticked \r\noff at this entire thing? ",
        "Mallet: Well, let's see. Well, we've got a \r\nwhole article here, and it's mostly about your father's legacy, and about \r\nBlake's run for mayor. And it finishes up with everything about-- talks about \r\nthe kids. So you have a whole article and it's not even about you and you're not \r\neven mentioned. So, yeah, I would be a little annoyed. ",
        "Dinah: Are you kidding me? I wasn\u2019t even \r\ntalking about this article. I was talking about this one on page six. This is \r\nunbelievable! No matter what I do, I'm invisible, an after-thought. ",
        "Mallet: Well, you make my front page \r\nheadline. ",
        "Dinah: I think that I'm going nuts. I'm at \r\nthe headline, but what about the other night. The other night when you said \r\n\"extra, extra,\" you now. \"Mallet and his ex-wife, they do it.\" ",
        "Mallet: That was history. All right. Very \r\nmuch history. Not a headline. ",
        "Dinah: You're going to tell me that your ego \r\ndoesn't love having two women who want you. ",
        "Mallet: Well there's one woman I don't want, \r\nand there is one that is more than I can handle. ",
        "Dinah: Yes, you're right, detective. I am \r\nmore than you can handle. ",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\nAva: Hey, what are you doing? Stop! ",
        "Coop: If you want to-- It's quitting time.\r\n",
        "Ava: I don't know who's watch you're looking \r\nat, but I'm still working. ",
        "Coop: Well, I said so because I'm the boss's \r\nson. Come on, let's go out and celebrate. What do you say? ",
        "Ava: Celebrate what? ",
        "Coop: Whatever. Do we need a reason to \r\ncelebrate? ",
        "Ava: If I'm going to be losing tips, yeah.\r\n",
        "Coop: Fine, fine. Let's go out and celebrate \r\nthat I did an amazing job of plastering the wall between our rooms, how about \r\nthat? You like that, don't you? ",
        "Ava: Yeah, you mean the whole you punched \r\nthrough the wall? Yeah. I'm still not convinced you didn't do that on purpose.\r\n",
        "Coop: Well, I guess that would just make the \r\nme the world's biggest Peeping Tom now, wouldn't it? ",
        "Ava: You want to be the best? ",
        "Coop: Oh. That is a good point. Anyways, \r\nlook. You, my dear, look pretty ravishing in the whole little facial mask thing \r\nyou had going on. ",
        "Ava: Oh, shut-- shut up! Stop it. ",
        "Coop: It was a good look for you; I liked it. \r\nCome on, let's just go out-- hey, it was a good look for you. Let's just have \r\nsome fun. Come on, lighten up a little bit. We had fun fixing the wall, didn't \r\nwe? Yes? ",
        "Ava: Yes. We had a lot of fun. We did. You \r\nknow, speaking of walls, there is something to be said for walls. You can't get \r\nhurt through walls. And you can't get heartbroken when a certain guy goes back \r\nto a certain girl again. ",
        "Coop: Ava, please. Come here, look at me. \r\nThat's not going to happen, all right? Lizzie and I are done. ",
        "Ava: Can I have your solemn vow on that?\r\n",
        "Coop: My solemn vow? ",
        "Ava: Yes. ",
        "Coop: Yes, you can. And I will cross my heart \r\nwith it, too. ",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\nJonathan: Why do I get the feeling you can't let go of the one night we spent \r\ntogether. ",
        "Lizzie: Oh, please. ",
        "Jonathan: You're here all of the time; you're \r\nlonely. ",
        "Lizzie: Okay, don't flatter yourself. I'm \r\nfine. ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, you look fine. ",
        "Lizzie: I just think it's a little hilarious \r\nand a little pathetic that all of a sudden you and Tammy think you can just work \r\nit out. Did you wake up a new respectable human being? Ooh, wait, wait. Now, \r\nTammy has a mom who doesn't hate you. ",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) Yeah, you're just pissy \r\nbecause I'm back with Tammy and Coop won't take you back. ",
        "Lizzie: He will soon. I stole Ava's room key \r\nfrom Buzz. I'm going to break in and look around-- ",
        "Jonathan: Bad idea. ",
        "Lizzie: How can you say that? ",
        "Jonathan: Because I know! Digging up dirt on \r\nAva's the worst thing you can do. ",
        "Lizzie: Well, listen to you, the relationship \r\nexpert. ",
        "Jonathan: No. But I'm doing a lot better than \r\nyou are. Look, if you want to get Coop back, the way to get him back is not to \r\nget rid of Ava. The way to get him back is to get rid of Coop. ",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\nCassie: You want me to invite Jonathan to dinner? ",
        "Tammy: Close your mouth. Flies. It's no big \r\ndeal. It can just be a normal family dinner. We sit around, we talk, we eat, we \r\nlaugh. Eat some more and talk. No fights, no fires, and no physical violence of \r\nany kind. ",
        "Cassie: Well, you know, that sounds \r\nrefreshing, when do you want to do this? ",
        "Tammy: Tonight? ",
        "Josh: ( Laughs ) ",
        "Tammy: What, why not? ",
        "Josh: Tammy, sometimes people like a little \r\nthing called notice. ",
        "Tammy: Why, so she can agonize over it and \r\nturn it into some huge deal which it doesn't need to be? You said you would \r\nrespect my decision to be with Jonathan, Mom. ",
        "Cassie: I did. ",
        "Tammy: You said you'd try. ",
        "Cassie: And I will, I will. And what better \r\nway than to plunge right in with a home-cooked meal. So, is Jonathan allergic to \r\nanything? I mean, other than me? ",
        "Tammy: Thank you. Thank you. Oh, you're the \r\nbest. ",
        "Josh: I just want to say that I think the two \r\nof you handled this very nicely. I'll see you; have fun tonight. ",
        "Cassie: No, no, no. I need reinforcements, \r\nand you've got to eat dinner. ",
        "Josh: That's a bad idea, Cassie. ",
        "Cassie: I think you're a coward. ",
        "Josh: I'm not a coward; I just think I would \r\nhurt more than I would help, and Jonathan doesn't like me a whole lot these \r\ndays. ",
        "Tammy: No, that is not true, Uncle Josh. \r\nJonathan likes you. ",
        "Josh: What? ",
        "Tammy: Okay, okay. Well, he respects you. \r\nWhich is better. Mom's right, you should be here. Besides, it would help to have \r\nanother guy, and you're a guy. ",
        "Josh: I appreciate you pointing that out.\r\n",
        "Tammy: Don't make me beg. ",
        "Josh: Okay, all right, I guess I can spare \r\nthe evening. ",
        "Cassie: Then we're set. I'll just see what's \r\nin the freezer, get cooking. What time is Jonathan coming over? ",
        "Tammy: I don't know, I haven't asked him yet.\r\n",
        "Cassie: This is going to be super. \n",
        "Josh: ( Laughs ) ",
        "Cassie: Fun, fun, fun. ",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\nLizzie: Get rid of Coop? Are you nuts? That is the last thing I would want to \r\ndo. ",
        "Jonathan: You're not listening. ",
        "Lizzie: Because you're not making any sense. \r\n( Cell phone rings ) ",
        "Jonathan: Hello. ",
        "Tammy: Hey. What are you doing right now?\r\n",
        "Jonathan: Nothing much. Why? ",
        "Tammy: Because I have an offer that you \r\ncannot refuse. ",
        "Jonathan: Dinner tonight? With your mom and \r\nJoshua, what are you looking for bloodshed? ",
        "Lizzie: ( Laughs ) ",
        "Tammy: Jonathan, where are you? ",
        "Jonathan: I'm at Outskirts. There are some \r\nreally obnoxious people here. Your mom wanting me to come over is not the same \r\nas playing musical chairs. ",
        "Tammy: Well, I didn't think that would be \r\npart of it. It's just dinner, and she's into it. So how about you? ",
        "Jonathan: I don't know. The last family event \r\nI went to turned into wrestle mania 20. ",
        "Tammy: Not this time. This is different. This \r\nis the start of us being normal again. ",
        "Jonathan: Normal? ",
        "Lizzie: Ooh, can I come? ",
        "Jonathan: Look, if it's that important to \r\nyou, okay. But let's get one thing straight: I am done auditioning to your \r\nfamily. If anything, they have something to prove to me now. ",
        "Tammy: Well, me, too. ",
        "Jonathan: Maybe. ",
        "Tammy: Well, how can I prove myself if you're \r\nnot here? ",
        "Jonathan: What time? ",
        "Tammy: Five, or whenever you can make it.\r\n",
        "Jonathan: Should I bring brownies? \n",
        "Lizzie: Oh, dinner with the family, it's so \r\nsweet. ",
        "Jonathan: Well, me and Tammy are going to try \r\nto be more normal. It's going to help us really stick. ",
        "Lizzie: Well, Coop and I are going to stick, \r\ntoo. ",
        "Jonathan: Uh-huh. Only if you take my advice \r\nand get him the hell out of dodge. ",
        "Lizzie: Dodge? What are you talking about?\r\n",
        "Jonathan: You know what, forget it? \n",
        "Lizzie: Forget what? ",
        "Jonathan: You're smart. You figure it out.\r\n",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\nCoop: Wow, I guess the walls are back up, aren't they? All plastered and \r\npainted, huh? ",
        "Ava: No. It's just that you and Lizzie just \r\nbroke up. I just want to take things slow, that's all. ",
        "Coop: Well, um, if that's the case, well, \r\nmaybe we should just cancel the plans for tonight and you should just put this \r\nback on. No, I'm just kidding. Ava, stop, please, come on. Look, I'm trying \r\nhere, okay? I just want to spend time with you. Is that so wrong? Just you and \r\nme, please. ",
        "Ava: Why? ",
        "Coop: You really don't know? ",
        "Ava: No. Tell me. ",
        "Coop: Okay. All right, fine, you want to hear \r\nit? Here it is: Because you're fine and you're funny, and you're witty and \r\nyou're smart. ",
        "Ava: And cute. ",
        "Coop: Yes, I was getting to there. You're \r\ncute, too. And every time-- ",
        "Ava: Sometimes. ",
        "Coop: No, all the time. Every time I'm with \r\nyou, I want to tell you everything, but like now, I can't even get a complete \r\nsentence out. And, um, your nose, you've got a cute little nose. I like that, \r\ntoo. And... ( cell phone rings) Come on. Oh, um, hello. Yeah, this is Henry \r\nCooper Bradshaw. Oxford. Um, yeah, yeah, right. The writing fellowship. That was \r\nlast year. Unfortunately I had to turn it down. Again? No, ah-- are you serious? \r\nAnother shot at Oxford? ",

        "\r\nGus: I don't know how those got there. ",
        "Harley: I saw you take one. ",
        "Gus: I just had one. Because my leg, the \r\nweather-- you know. Listen, all I need is an aspirin, honestly, and I don't have \r\nan aspirin. It's no big deal. ",
        "Harley: Then why lie to me about it? \n",
        "Gus: Did I? I just didn't want you to worry \r\nabout it, that's all. I know you're such a worry wart. ",
        "Harley: Honey, if you're leg hurts, go to a \r\ndoctor. Talk to the doctor about what's wrong with your leg. They can make it \r\nbetter, but don't start messing with these things. ",
        "Gus: All right, listen. You take those, you \r\ncan have those, okay. You take them, do-- flush them down the toilet because all \r\nI need is aspirin. If I can just have an aspirin, I'll just take an aspirin. \r\nI'll be happy with that. That's all I need. ",
        "Harley: Just talk to Rick, he is a good guy. \r\nJust talk to him. ",
        "Gus: Rick, okay. ",

Where I grew up, \r\npeople don't become actors. It's not in the list of things, a high school \r\nmoment. I thought I could do this for the rest of my life. And I did. \n",

        "Cassie: That's great. ",
        "Tammy: He's doing Jonathan a favor because he \r\nhelped him when his car broke down. ",
        "Cassie: That's great. ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, a friend to every drunk in \r\ntown, including your brother. Not that I think he is drinking now, to my \r\nknowledge, but Billy's all right. You know, I think he has made a lot of \r\nmistakes of his own, and that's why he doesn't judge people. ",
        "Cassie: Do you enjoy owning a bar? I know it \r\nwas kind of forced on you. ",
        "Tammy: He's great at it. ",
        "Cassie: But is it something you want to do \r\nlong-term? Or are there other things you want to do? ",
        "Jonathan: No. I never thought I would ever be \r\nthis settled down. ",
        "Cassie: You mean at this age? ",
        "Jonathan: No. I mean, owning something and \r\nbeing responsible, that was never my thing. ",
        "Josh: Really, you? ",
        "Cassie: Some people take longer to find \r\nthemselves. ",
        "Josh: I can certainly relate to that. I was \r\none of those people. ",
        "Cassie: Oh, come on. I'm sure you always knew \r\nwhere were you headed and had your feet planted firmly on the ground. \n",
        "Josh: No, that's not true. I did a lot of \r\nthings growing up and made a lot of people angry at me, including my father.\r\n",
        "Cassie: Really? ",
        "Josh: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Cassie: I never knew that about you? \n",
        "Jonathan: You always had his millions to fall \r\nback on if you screwed up. ",
        "Josh: That was a blessing and a curse. \r\nEverything comes with a price, including money. ",
        "Cassie: That's right, everything does. I \r\nthink we all make our mistakes. I think we all have to pay our dues one way or \r\nanother. The important thing is that ultimately you come to a place where you're \r\nhappy. I'm grateful tonight that we're all feeling pretty happy, right? \n",
        "Tammy: Right. ",
        "Cassie: And we have what matters most right \r\nhere. We have family, and we have love. What did I say? ",

        "Ava: I know. I know, about the writing \r\nfellowship. What did they say? ",
        "Coop: They said they received an anonymous \r\ngrant, which means that this year there's going to be another writing \r\nfellowship. ",
        "Ava: And you got it? ",
        "Coop: No, I didn't get it, but they said if I \r\nwould reapply, that they would put me on the short list for it. ",
        "Ava: Well, you almost had it last year. Coop, \r\nthat's so awesome! ",
        "Coop: I've got to think about this, Ava.\r\n",
        "Ava: Think about what? Are you kidding me? I \r\nknow how much you wanted this. You left it behind because of Lizzie. Come on, we \r\nreally have something to celebrate. Let's go. ",
        "Coop: That's true. ",
        "Lizzie: Can I celebrate, too? ",
        "Ava: Lizzie, how did you know about Oxford?\r\n",
        "Lizzie: Oxford? I was talking about Coop's \r\nbirthday. What are you guys talking about? ",
        "Ava: It's your birthday today? ",
        "Lizzie: Tomorrow. ",
        "Ava: Why didn't you tell me? ",
        "Lizzie: Henry hates to make a big deal about \r\nhis birthday. ",
        "Coop: Well, that depends. Sometimes I am \r\nreally up for celebrating. ",
        "Lizzie: Is that what you guys are going to do \r\ntomorrow night? ",
        "Coop: Or tonight. Whatever you want. \n",
        "Lizzie: Wow, you must really be a good \r\ninfluence on him, Ava. Maybe you can get him to accept this small gift. \n",
        "Coop: Lizzie-- ",
        "Lizzie: No, wait. It is nothing fancy. It's \r\njust something that I saw that I thought you would like. We're friends now. \r\nFriends remember each other's birthdays. ",
        "Ava: Open it. ",
        "Coop: Oh. ",
        "Lizzie: You're always jotting down ideas for \r\nstories, so I thought-- ",
        "Coop: Lizzie, this is beautiful. This is... \r\nthis is... thank you. ",
        "Ava: You can take it to Oxford. ",
        "Coop: If I go. ",
        "Ava: When you go. ",
        "Lizzie: Oxford again, what are you guys \r\ntalking about? ",
        "Ava: He just got a call from Oxford saying \r\nthey have another writing fellowship, and Coop is going to get it. ",
        "Coop: That's a little optimistic-- \n",
        "Lizzie: Really? That's great. I'm so happy \r\nfor you. ",
        "Coop: It is not definite, and there are tests \r\nI have to take and writings and samples. ",
        "Lizzie: Please. They gave it to you before, \r\nand they're going to give it to him again. ",
        "Ava: Exactly. ",
        "Lizzie: You are so sweet to be so supportive.\r\n",
        "Ava: Why wouldn't I be? ",
        "Lizzie: I don't know, I guess if I was still \r\nhis girlfriend, I'd probably be worried that he'd go off and follow up with one \r\nof those classy, brilliant Oxford girls and never come home. But clearly you \r\nmust be more secure than I am. ",
        "Ava: Clearly. ",

        "\r\nHarley: Thank you. So tell me about last night. Any problems? ",
        "Dinah: No problems. None. ",
        "Harley: Good. Because the people are raving \r\nwhat a great party it was, the coverage by the press is amazing, and we raised \r\ntons of money... ",
        "Dinah: We did a good job. All of us did.\r\n",
        "Harley: Yeah. And I'm sorry I didn't give you \r\na heads-up about the speech. That was really a last-minute decision because I \r\nfelt like I wasn't going to be there, but I should be there in some small way to \r\nshow people that I'm in charge, that somebody is in charge. Especially with \r\nAlan-Michael. ",
        "Dinah: Well, you know what, people know that \r\nyou're in charge. They do, especially now. ",
        "Harley: You mad at me? ",
        "Dinah: About what? ",
        "Harley: Okay. This is me promising you for \r\nthe record that the next time there's some big event at Spaulding, come hell or \r\nhigh water, I will be there. ",
        "Dinah: Well, good. That's what I wanted to \r\nhear. So, Gus, he looks a little stronger. The pills aren't an issue anymore?\r\n",

        "\r\nTammy: It's not right, is it? Okay, so you don't like this, not yet. I just \r\nwanted to prove that I love you, that I can have you and I can have my family, \r\ntoo. ",
        "Jonathan: It's just weird. ",
        "Tammy: And you're not ready to trust that. I \r\ncan't say I blame you. You think I'm pushing. ",
        "Jonathan: No, it wasn't that. ",
        "Tammy: What? ",
        "Jonathan: No, it wasn't that, whatever, \r\ndinner, being with your mom, she was like really talking to me, and she would \r\nlook me in the eyes. I don't know. I know we took a few shots at each other, but \r\nit felt kind of harmless. I guess, like when a real family takes shots at each \r\nother. I don't know. ",
        "Tammy: So you liked it? ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I mean... I mean not to do \r\nevery night, but sometimes, yeah. ",
        "Tammy: So why did you come out here? \n",
        "Jonathan: I don't know. I'm kind of freaked \r\nout. But I had an okay time. ",
        "Tammy: Jonathan. Thank you. Hmmm, thank you.\r\n",

        "Lizzie: Please, those are details. The point \r\nis, Coop, your dream is going to come true. ",
        "Coop: Well, at least part of it. Is your \r\npassport ready? ",
        "Ava: Is my-- mine? Yeah, why. ",
        "Coop: Because you're going to need it if \r\nyou're going to come with me. ",
        "Ava: Come with you... ",
        "Coop: To Oxford. Ava, listen, okay? You can \r\nget a waitress job over there just as easily as here, right? ",
        "Ava: Yeah. ",
        "Coop: And you can take classes, too. So when \r\nwe're not taking classes and when you're not taking classes or working, we can \r\ntravel. We can go to see Bath. We can go to Brighton. We could even go to \r\nLondon. And if my brother's around, we can even see him, too. Plus the easiest \r\nthing is... Paris is just so close, right next door. ",
        "Ava: Paris? ",
        "Coop: Yes. What do you think? ",
        "Lizzie: Coop, hi, wait. ",
        "Ava: What do I think? ",
        "Lizzie: That might not be workable. Ava needs \r\nto get a visa. ",
        "Coop: That's not a problem. I mean, we have \r\nplenty of time between now and then, but the only question is: Are you \r\ninterested? ",
        "Ava: Am I interested? Are you kidding me? Oh, \r\nmy gosh, Paris! Yes, of course. ",
        "Coop: That's answer enough. Okay, you know \r\nwhat? Let me just tell you, if I can find the guy who gave this anonymous grant, \r\nI don't know what I would do. I would probably give him a kiss or something like \r\nthat at this point. ",
        "Ava: Okay. ",
        "Coop: Come on, I'll tell you what. Come here, \r\nI've got something to show you. ",

        "Mallet: What is up with him? Is he all right?\r\n",
