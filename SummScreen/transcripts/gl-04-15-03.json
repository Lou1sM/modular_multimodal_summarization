        "Marina: Okay, okay. I can do this. I can do this. I can do this. I can do \r\nthis. Okay, I just have to figure out what the guy wants, and I got to give it \r\nto him, and it'll be fine... If I could just figure out what it is that the guy \r\nwants before he comes back. ",
        "Thug: If anyone asks you, you don't know anything, or I\u2019ll slit that pretty little throat of yours. ",
        "Marina: Okay, okay. What... what could someone possibly have? I just don't...\r\n",
        "(Laughter) ",
        "Reva: Don't even think that. ",
        "Shayne: Look at you. What, are you expecting the ghost of the crazy curator?\r\n",
        "Marina: Oh, ha, ha. Like you're not scary enough. ",
        "Josh: How are you doing, Marina? ",
        "Marina: Fine. I'm totally fine, yeah. What's wrong, Mrs. Lewis? ",
        "Reva: Actually I was just going to ask you the same thing. Are you in some \r\nkind of trouble? ",

        "Ben: Ramona, hi. ",
        "Ramona: I've been waiting for your call. ",
        "Ben: Yeah, I've been meaning to call you. I just... ",
        "Ramona: Well, then I guess I saved you the trouble. I was wondering if you \r\nhad an answer for me. ",
        "Ben: An answer? ",
        "Ramona: Did I wake you, Benjamin? You seem a little foggy. ",
        "Ben: No, no. I'm sorry. No, I'm wide awake. ",
        "Ramona: Good. That's just the way I like it. So I was wondering if you were \r\nready to make a commitment? You know, make our arrangement a regular part of \r\nyour schedule? Benjamin? ",
        "Ben: I'm right here, and actually, I was wondering if you'd like to get \r\ntogether today down at the Beacon. ",
        "Ramona: Perfect. I'll book the suite. ",
        "Ben: I'll be waiting in the lobby. ",

        "Harley: My kids would love this. I'm sorry, you must have the wrong room, \r\nbecause I'm actually getting better. I'm almost on my way home. ",
        "Cassie: Check her vitals. ",
        "Blake: Okay, according to this chart, she's suffering from an acute case of \r\nhospital-itis. ",
        "Cassie: Oh, left untreated, it could get very, very... ",
        "Blake: Ugly. Very ugly, yes. Definitely showing all the symptoms. ",
        "Cassie: Playing with the remote control in her hospital bed. ",
        "Blake: Not recognizing her best friends. (Laughter) We'll definitely going \r\nto have to operate. That's right. ",
        "Harley: Get away from me. ",
        "Cassie: Oh, come on, you didn't know it was us. These are great costumes. \r\nAren't these great costumes? ",
        "Harley: You guys are going to have to work a little harder at being \r\nundercover. Come on, I saw your curly hair, Blake. ",
        "Blake: Oh. ",
        "Harley: And I bought those shoes with you. ",
        "Blake: Oh, right. (Laughter) Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Look what we \r\nhave for you. ",
        "Cassie: Rick said you could have whatever you want, as long as we leave him \r\nsome. ",
        "Harley: He would. This is all for me? ",
        "Blake: Of course it is, you dope. ",
        "Cassie: And us, too. (Laughter) ",

        "Alan: Basketball. ",
        "Gus: Do you play? ",
        "Alan: No, no. Our father wouldn't allow it. He didn't want his children to \r\nlearn how to be team players. ",
        "Gus: That's very sad. ",
        "Alan: Yeah, it is. My son, Phillip, he was a good player, especially when he \r\nwas young. I guess sports like basketball is... Something that fathers and sons \r\nhave in common. What about you? ",
        "Gus: What about me? ",
        "Alan: I was... I was just wondering about you and your father. ",
        "",
        "Marina: No. No, no, I'm fine. I'm in no trouble. You know, not any more than \r\nusual anyway. ",
        "Reva: (Laughs) ",
        "Marina: Really. ",
        "Shayne: Mom... ",
        "Reva: No. I just... I just want Marina to know that she could tell us if \r\nthere was some kind of a problem. ",
        "Marina: Yeah, of course. Of course. Of course, I would. Shayne, I tell \r\neveryone everything, right? ",
        "Shayne: Pretty much. Mom, she's okay. She's fine. ",
        "Josh: Yeah, she looks like she's fine to me, too. Hey, why don't we go out to \r\nthe car and get the rest of the stuff, and then we can track down our daughter. \r\nCome here. You want to tell me what that was about? ",
        "Reva: It was really nothing. It was... It was just a feeling, I guess. ",
        "Josh: Just tell me. ",
        "Reva: It's no big deal. It came and it went. It's probably just... Jet lag is \r\nmaking me loopy. ",
        "",
        "Shayne: Are you sure you're okay? ",
        "Marina: Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. I'm totally fine. What's up with your mom, \r\nthough? She was acting really weird. ",
        "Shayne: Yeah, what else is new? She just got back from Vienna. She went to \r\ntalk to these doctors about this thing that's been happening to her. She was... \r\nWell, she thinks she's feeling what people think. It's kind of like reading \r\nminds. I think that's what she thought she was doing with you or something. ",
        "Marina: That's very spooky. ",
        "",
        "Reva: It was a sight. ",
        "Marah: Mom. ",
        "Reva: There you are. ",
        "Marah: How was Vienna? ",
        "Josh: Excuse me. Coming through. ",
        "Marah: I wish I could have come with you. ",
        "Reva: Oh, I missed you so much. But I brought presents. ",
        "Marina: Hey, you guys, I think I'm actually going to get out of here. I \r\nthought Ben was going to be here, but he's not, so... ",
        "Marah: I think he said something about the Beacon. ",
        "Marina: Oh, well, excellent. Then that is where I\u2019ll be. ",
        "Reva: Put that upstairs when you have a minute. ",
        "Marina: Mrs. Lewis, the other day when you and all the moms were like, you \r\nknow, cleaning stuff out in here, you didn't find anything unusual, did you? ",
        "Reva: Um, can you be more specific? ",
        "Marina: I would if I could. ",
        "Reva: Well, all I really remember is a whole lot of garbage. ",
        "Marina: Yeah, you know what? Don't worry about it. It's really not a big \r\ndeal. I'll see you. ",
        "Marah: Okay. ",
        "Shayne: Marina, I\u2019m going to call you later. Like you care. So what happened \r\non your trip? What did the doctors say, huh? Did they say that you got \r\nsuperpowers or what? I hope so, because I need you to read my math teacher's \r\nmind for the test on Tuesday. ",
        "",
        "Blake: There you go. ",
        "Harley: (Sighs) Thank you. My gosh, I forgot how nice it was to have \r\nsomebody brush your hair. (Laughter) ",
        "Blake: It's good, isn't it? Wait, wait, wait. Here, here, here. ",
        "Harley: Am I done? ",
        "Blake: Nice. ",
        "Cassie: Well, getting there. ",
        "Harley: Oh, no, I don't mean my hair. I mean... Oh, my gosh, I look like \r\nsomebody who was... ",
        "Blake: Shot and almost died. ",
        "Harley: Yeah. ",
        "Blake: Yeah. Here. I have something else for you, to cheer you up. Pictures.\r\n",
        "Harley: Oh, I can't look. ",
        "Blake: No, Ross took them last night. ",
        "Harley: Yes, yes. Look at my guys. ",
        "Blake: Yeah. Clarissa and Zach? It's love. It's love. ",
        "Cassie: I like the one of Kevin and Jason holding Jude upside down. That's \r\npretty funny. (Laughter) ",
        "Harley: Was he breathing? He looks blue. Oh, you guys, these are the best. \r\nYou guys are the best. ",
        "Blake: Yeah. ",
        "Harley: Tell Ross I said thank you. This is terrific. Oh, I cannot wait to \r\nget out of here and get my hands on these little guys. ",
        "Blake: Yeah, well, they miss you, too, you know. They do. ",
        "Cassie: Especially Zach. I think it's because he just got you back, you know? \r\nHe won't let anybody do anything for him. I can't tie his shoes. I can't read \r\nhim his story. \"It's only Mommy.\" ",
        "Harley: You're killing me. ",
        "Blake: I'm sorry. ",
        "Cassie: When are you getting out of here? ",
        "Harley: Well, actually I'm hoping tomorrow. I mean, I don't want to get my \r\nhopes up or anything, but I'm starting to go a little nuts. I really think that \r\nI can do my recuperating at home with my kids so that they don't forget what \r\nit's like to spend time with me. ",
        "Blake: Oh, that's not going to happen. ",
        "Harley: You think so? I feel like all I've done is shuffle those guys around \r\nbecause of my work. And then this happens because of my work. I mean, what is \r\nthis, this, my job, tearing my family apart? ",
        "Cassie: Hey, what is this? Working mother's guilt? ",
        "Blake: Yeah, we all go through it. ",
        "Harley: Well, you least you guys don't have to worry about, you know, getting \r\nmortally wounded on the job. It just makes me wonder if it's worth it. ",
        "Cassie: But you love being a cop. ",
        "Harley: Yes, but I love my family, too. I mean, you've got your kids, you've \r\ngot your family, and you've got the people you love. What else really matters?\r\n",

        "Alexandra: My brother, he's disappeared. ",
        "Rick: He's disappeared? Oh, that's great. Good timing, Alex. I was ready to \r\ntell you we're ready to take him for his MRI. Listen I\u2019ve got some time. I can \r\nhelp you find him. ",

        "Nolan: I am so sorry about this. I don't know what I was thinking. I mean, I \r\nshouldn't have left him alone. I'm going to... I'm going to check down the hall, \r\nall right? ",

        "Gus: Maybe you weren\u2019t. Forget it. ",
        "Alan: Well, maybe it... Maybe it was the voices that I hear in here. You see, \r\nthey... they make me say things and they do things that I wouldn't normally do.\r\n",
        "Gus: You're scaring me, big Al. You sound... That sounds pretty scary. ",
        "Alan: Yeah, yeah, it's very scary at times. I... Wait. Wait, I remember now. \r\nBasketball. Yeah, that's what we were talking about. Did your father play \r\nbasketball? ",
        "Gus: No. My father liked all sports pretty much. Baseball mostly. ",
        "Alan: Mmm. ",
        "Gus: Mets games. He used to watch a couple Bulls games. He taught me how to \r\nshoot a jump shot. ",
        "Alan: A jump shot, really? Those are pretty difficult. Let me see. Go ahead. \r\nWow. Well, that was very impressive. I bet your father was proud of you. ",
        "Gus: I don't know, Al. Are you proud of your kids? ",
        "Alan: Oh, I\u2019m proud of both of my boys. Alan-Michael and Phillip. But they \r\nleft. ",
        "Gus: They what? ",

        "Gus: Well, that's a very sad story, Al. ",
        "Alan: Yeah, that is sad. I guess it was mostly my fault. I... I must have \r\nbeen terrible to Phillip. I can't really remember, but that's what people tell \r\nme. But I'm still his father. Tell me, don't you think that I deserve a second \r\nchance? ",

        "Reva: You know, actually I did pass by that place on my way back to the hotel \r\none night, and it looked so beautiful. It was all lit up. But I thought, \"No, \r\nI'm not going to go. I'm going to save that fun stuff for when we have a family \r\nvisit there.\" I pretty much stayed focused on why I was there at the time. ",
        "Marah: And what did you find out? Did you figure out why you're reading \r\nminds? ",
        "Reva: Yes and no. I mean, Dr. Langham tried to explain it all to me in \r\nlaymen's term, but it was still difficult to try to wrap my head around it. And \r\nit's a little difficult to try and explain to you, too. ",
        "Shayne: Just give it your best shot. ",
        "Reva: Okay. Dr. Langham is a psychiatrist who specializes in the study \r\nScience Energy or Energy Science. Anyway, it's the energy that is given off from \r\npeople who are both dead and alive. And some people have the ability to be able \r\nto receive that energy and read it. ",
        "Shayne: So then it's like a common thing? You're not an X-man? ",
        "Reva: Well, unfortunately, no, I'm not. But the ability to receive this \r\nenergy has a lot to with the fact that I tend to be an emotional person. (\r\nLaughs) ",
        "Marah: No? ",
        "Reva: Yeah. And it's... it's been an emotional year, you know, with Richard\u2019s \r\ndeath and the trial and then the stalking business. And I was open to receive \r\nthat energy. I mean, it could go away as easily as it came on, and then I\u2019ll \r\njust go back to being your ordinary, regular wife and mother. (Laughter) ",
        "Shayne: Yeah, I\u2019m still waiting for that day to come. ",
        "Reva: Yeah, well... This is nothing for any of you to worry about. ",
        "Josh: So that's it? That's the whole deal? I mean, you don't have to follow \r\nup with any different kind of therapy or anything? You just relax and it goes \r\naway? ",
        "Reva: Actually, Dr. Langham is coming to make a speech at Springfield \r\nUniversity. And he's going to conduct a study while he's here, too. ",
        "Marah: He wants to study you? ",
        "Reva: No, no. He asked me to be a part of it, but the more I thought about \r\nit, the more I thought it wasn\u2019t really a good idea. ",
        "Josh: Wow... ",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, I knew you've be relieved. I know I am. And I understand \r\nwhy you would be, I do. I mean, it's time to move on. I know everything I need \r\nto know about this gift of mine. ",
        "Josh: And you're comfortable with that? ",
        "Reva: Very comfortable. ",
        "Josh: Okay. So it sounds like the trip was worthwhile. ",
        "Reva: Absolutely. And until this second sight of mines goes away, I want you \r\nall to know that I intend to use my abilities for good, not evil. ",
        "Josh: (Laughs) ",
        "Reva (in English accent): But I would be aware of any bad thoughts you have \r\nof me. You might as well just say them out loud, because chances are, I can read \r\nthem. (Laughter) And hear them. ",
        "Marah: Well, I will keep that in mind, but I\u2019m just glad to have you back, \r\nand maybe things can calm down a little bit now. ",
