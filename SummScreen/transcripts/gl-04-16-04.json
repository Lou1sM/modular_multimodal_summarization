What did you do?", "Jeffrey: Not everybody could just, you know, drop everything and zip off to paris.", "Marah: Well, I think i dropped everything in there.", "Jeffrey: Yes, I noticed. And I had a few responsibilities...", "Marah: Hmm...", "Jeffrey: ...I had to take care of.", "Marah: Well, I have responsibilities, too.", "Jeffrey: Yeah?", "Marah: Yeah. They just all have to be in paris right now.", "Jeffrey: Right. (Laughs)", "Marah: Can you believe I am meeting with one of the biggest fashion houses in france tomorrow?", "Jeffrey: Of course, I believe it. You're a talented fashion designer, marah.", "Marah: Oh! I love mindy for setting this up.", "Jeffrey: That's great.", "Marah: It's going to be the start of something big. I can feel it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Remind me again why we're here?", "Eden: You are tying to be the best maid-of-honor and future sister-in-law the world's ever seen.", "Harley: Right. God, I hate this place.", "Eden: Oh, that's right. I keep forgetting, you're a repeat offender when it comes to the spauldings. Did you ever have a wedding here?", "Harley: Yep.", "Eden: Was it amazing?", "Harley: It was a lifetime ago. You know what, eden? I got to go.", "Eden: Harley, you cannot desert me. You have been married before, more than once. I haven'T. You have done these things before. I don't know how to do them.", "Harley: Okay. Calm down. This is what you say? You say, \"alexandra, I'm getting married. Not only do I need time off, but I can't find any place to get married. So how's about letting use the spaulding estate garden?\" And when she says no...", "Eden: No.", "Harley: ...You keep badgering her till she says yes. That's it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alexandra: All right, eden make it snappy. I've got a new houseguest that i have to keep an eye on-- olivia spencer.", "Eden: Olivia spencer. That must be fun.", "Alexandra: Oh, loads and loads.", "Harley: Hi, alex.", "Alexandra: Hello, harley. What a surprise. Well?", "Eden: Okay, well... I need a little time off from bad girl.", "Alexandra: Time off. Why?", "Eden: I'm getting married and I need three or four weeks, at least, for the wedding and the honeymoon.", "Alexandra: You are the original bad girl, eden. You can't get married and settle down. No, no, I absolutely forbid it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: No, I'm telling do not believe this. Well, of course, we absolutely deny it.", "Michelle: Oh, I promise you that these stories are not true.", "Bill: There's not one shred of proof.", "Michelle: No, no, he didn't break the law.", "Bill: All right.", "Michelle: Danny ran an honest campaign. All right, bye.", "Bill: Well, that's a record even for me-- ten calls in ten minutes. (Phone rmngs)", "Michelle: Bill, you want to take that for you? I will.", "Bill: No, you know what? I'll get it later. In fact, I think we should lay off on the phone calls for now. We got to figure out what our next step ought to be.", "Michelle: You got any ideas?", "Bill: Well, the first thing we got to do is make it clear to danny there's no reason to concede. I think it's time to go public, make a statement. He's got to deny these rumors.", "Michelle: Right, and the sooner the better, so let's go find him.", "Bill: Yeah, right.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: Hey, there. It's danny santos.", "Salerno: Danny santos, the man in the news.", "Danny: Yeah, so you've heard.", "Salerno: Heard, seen, read. You're everywhere, danny. I'm surprised to hear from you. I figured you'd have your hands full about now.", "Danny: Oh, yeah, I do, but there's something that you and i need to take care of.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eden: Where the hell do you get off telling me that I cannot get married?", "Alexandra: Because you're simply going to ruin everything by taking a husband. And please, not just any husband, but a lewis is not good.", "Eden: Oh, gee, I am sorry that my choice in men is not appropriate for you.", "Harley: I wouldn't ask her about the garden.", "Alexandra: Maybe you haven't noticed through your haze of love, my dear, but the spaulding stock is in the proverbial dumper as we speak, and one of few hopes of getting it out is bad girl. It happens to be doing phenomenally well.", "Harley: Yeah, I use it.", "Alexandra: Yes, and the last thing we need to do is jeopardize the bad girl's name. It's image, you see. And if you marry someone and become do-do- domesticated, then...", "Eden: I have a life, alex. There's nowhere in my contract that it says that I need to stay single.", "Alexandra: Do you speak english? Right. Will you explain to her why this is the wrong move at the wrong time?", "Harley: Well, I don't think it is, and I think that bill is quite the catch.", "Alexandra: (Laughs) honestly. (Stammering) you know, it's not just spaulding here that is at risk, my dear. You stand to lose money. I mean, serious money, and it's all going to come right out of your pocket.", "Eden: You know, then I will just chalk that up to the cost of love, wouldn't I? You know, I cannot believe that I am having this conversation.", "Alexandra: Well, neither can I, considering the news of the day, which may greatly affect your major catch.", "Harley/eden: What news?", "Alexandra: Well, haven't you heard? You two must have been in a cave, huh?", "Harley: Close. A bridal shop.", "Alexandra: Well, the recount's finished. The election's been given to ross marler.", "Eden: What?", "Alexandra: Yes. Not only that, it looks as though danny santos is going to be indicted on charges of voter fraud.", "Harley: Oh, no.", "Eden: Bill's got to be flipping out. I got to get to him.", "Alexandra: All right. By the way, will you rethink this ridiculous idea about marriage?", "Eden: Excuse me. See ya.", "Harley: See ya, alex.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Come on.", "Michelle: We are going to continue to fight, and that's what he needs to make clear in his statement.", "Bill: Right, right. Well, maybe if you drive, I can draft something up.", "Michelle: Okay, all right. And he's innocent. That's also important.", "Bill: Oh, my goodness. Did you read this part? \"The initial count revealed more votes cast for santos in the fifth street district than were legally registered there.\"", "Michelle: What?!", "Bill: I mean, this is unbelievable.", "Michelle: What? Danny did not buy votes. No. Bill, he's a changed man. You know that. He is.", "Bill: I know, I know, michelle, but let's face it. You know, his image took a real big hit here.", "Michelle: Oh, bill.", "Bill: Which is why you've got to be at the podium at the press conference, okay? You've got to make your own statement of support. It's important. Very, very important.", "Michelle: Okay, but it's what he says that counts. And he's got the truth on his side, remember?", "Bill: Finally.", "Tony: Hey.", "Michelle: Hi.", "Tony: Oh, honey, I'm sorry. Sorry.", "Bill: Excuse me. I got to take this, okay?", "Tony: So how are you holding up?", "Michelle: I'm just worried, you know, about danny. Not me. Because these rumors, they're going to kill him.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: We alone?", "Salerno: You mean is anyone listening in? Not on my end. Yours?", "Danny: I have no idea, and with what's been going on. Who the hell knows?", "Salerno: From mayor to monster in one news day. Well, you know that's the press for you, you know? So what's up, danny? Why'd you call?", "Danny: I just want to make sure I'm not going to get slammed with something else, like a charge that I took money from you. So just to confirm, you offered to make a cash donation to my campaign and I turned you down, right?", "Salerno: I think you're exact words were, \"keep your money.\"", "Danny: And that's as far as our association went.", "Salerno: In that area, yeah.", "Danny: I said we might have company on the line.", "Salerno: Maybe you should have taken my money, danny. It might have helped. You know, I tend to back winners.", "Danny: Are you kidding me? I was a winner. They're already calling me, mr. Mayor, and then a couple hours later they just take it all away from me.", "Salerno: Was that unfair or was it just bad luck?", "Danny: You know what? It doesn't even matter. The people who thought I'd never be able to go straight are just thinking they were right the whole time. I can turn myself into a saint and it wouldn't change their minds about me, which makes me wonder why I even bothered trying at all.", "Salerno: Good question.", "Danny: What the hell am i supposed to do now, huh? You know what? Forget it. This is not your problem. I just want to make sure we're on the same page.", "Salerno: I think we are.", "Danny: Good.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: Hi.", "Marah: Oh, you don't want to stop.", "Jeffrey: No, I don'T. But you know, there's a little matter of a scheduled plane that we have to catch, and I noticed you made a few last-minute purchases there.", "Marah: Yes, I did. (Laughs) oh, who cares about the schedules? It's a chartered jet. They can wait.", "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, they can wait, but, you know, those hot shots in paris that you've got to meet with tomorrow are not going to wait. And we've got a seven-hour flight to think about, and then we've got to catch a cab and we've got to clear customs and we've got to fight rush hour traffic into the city. You're cutting it close as it is. Trust me.", "Marah: Okay, okay. You know, there are other reasons that I do want to go to paris besides business.", "Jeffrey: Oh, yeah?", "Marah: Mm-hmm. There are lots of other things that I want to do-- together. Do you think you could teach me some french phrases on the way? Just a few key phrases?", "Jeffrey: (Speaking french)", "Marah: I hope that was something nice.", "Jeffrey: It was.", "Marah: (Laughs) good, then tell me more.", "Jeffrey: No, later! Come on. First things first, let's go.", "Marah: Okay. First thing, then, is getting this closed.", "Jeffrey: Yes.", "Marah: Did you think when you met me you'd be getting a girl with so much baggage?", "Jeffrey: That's very funny.", "Marah: (Laughs) it's not really that much of a joke.", "Jeffrey: I promise you, when you get to paris, you're not going to miss a thing.", "Marah: Here or there?", "Jeffrey: Both.", "Marah: We're okay, aren't we? I mean, I just want to make sure that we're both going into this with our eyes open.", "Jeffrey: I see you.", "Marah: Good. Because I just... I want to make sure that, you know, you don't pretend like this thing with carrie never happened, because it did, and it's a part of who i am now. Just don't put me on a pedestal or anything.", "Jeffrey: You know, you don't have to put some people on a pedestal because they're already there.", "Marah: Aw.", "Jeffrey: Put your passport into your bag and get everything that you need. Don't worry about the luggage. I've already arranged for somebody to pick it up for us. Come on.", "Marah: (Laughs) you take really good care of me, you know that?", "Jeffrey: I do my best.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ed: I was afraid of something like this.", "Michelle: Oh. Oh, you were? So then you think that danny did rig the vote.", "Ed: No, I'M... the newspapers said that the allegations came from a pretty reliable source.", "Michelle: Yeah, well, you know those newspapers. They always get everything right, dad.", "Ed: I am not saying that, but...", "Michelle: No, you're saying that this rings true for you.", "Ed: I am not the bad guy here.", "Michelle: Well, you're not acting like my dad. What happened to the guy who had the santos button on the other night, who was raising his glass to toast his son-in-law, the new mayor of springfield?", "Ed: All I care about is you.", "Michelle: Well, you care about me, you care about my husband, and that's how it works.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Oh, my goodness, this is unbelievable. National news is on the story now. You ready to go?", "Michelle: You know what? I'm going to meet you there. I need to talk to my dad.", "Bill: Hey, are you okay?", "Michelle: I'm great.", "Bill: Michelle, we are going to fix this thing, okay? We are. Come here. Come here. Hey, eden. What's going on? Did you hear the news?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eden: Just now.", "Harley: What a mess. Where's danny?", "Bill: Well, I'm on my way over there right now, but I've got to go, and I'll call you later, okay?", "Eden: Okay. Okay.", "Bill: Just when things haven't been tough enough on her lately, huh? All right, I'll see you.", "Harley: Poor michelle. I feel so bad for her.", "Eden: Yeah. It just doesn't seem fair. Her life is falling apart and mine is falling into place.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alexandra: Brad? Brad, call me as soon as you get this message, would you? We've got a problem with bad girl, and I want to nip it in the bud as soon as possible. The last thing we need is some sticky situation at spaulding right now. (Knock at door)", "Sandy: Well, hello, ms. Spaulding.", "Alexandra: Hello, sandy. Are you here to see lizzie?", "Sandy: Uh, she left her books at rehearsal. I thought she might need them, and it wasn't out of my way, so here I am. Your door was unlocked.", "Alexandra: (Laughs) well, of course, it was. Well, thank you. I'll make sure that lizzie gets them.", "Sandy: Thank you. And I wanted to thank you for all that time you spent helping us rehearse the other day.", "Alexandra: Oh, well. My goodness, I had a lovely time. Besides, you didn't really need me. I could tell you had everything under control.", "Sandy: Well, I'm giving it my best shot. It's been fun.", "Alexandra: Yeah. You know, I know it's been wonderful for lizzie. I mean, she's always loved her acting and everything, but this is the first time she's had a grownup part. I'm afraid she's really going to miss it when it's over.", "Sandy: Nah, she won't miss it. It's time for all that end-of- the-school-year stuff, you know? The prom, the graduation.", "Alexandra: Oh, yes, yes. Yes, yes, indeed. I can't believe that she's graduating from high school.", "Sandy: Time flies, huh?", "Alexandra: Sure does, doesn't it? Oh, that reminds me. What's it going to be? Diamond earrings or a trip to europe? Huh? Oh, well, why not both?", "Sandy: Well, if you ask me, i think lizzie needs something a lot more basic and close to home.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marah: One more time, let me check to make sure that I have everything. Passport, address book, euros, phone, and gum. Can't forget that gum.", "Jeffrey: That'd be a disaster.", "Marah: I have everything, including vous.", "Jeffrey: Toi. They're going to start boarding pretty soon.", "Marah: I'm so excited. (Laughs) I can't believe I get to fall asleep in your arms and wake up in paris. I feel so alive, finally. I feel like it's a fresh start on a new day and I get to make it with you, in paris.", "Jeffrey: It's great that you feel that way, you feel like you're making a new start.", "Marah: Don't get all serious on me. (Laughs) half, maybe three-quarters of the reason I'm going on this trip is for fun.", "Jeffrey: No. No, marah, the whole reason you're going is so that you can heal and let go of that baggage you were talking about. Remember?", "Marah: Yeah.", "Jeffrey: And you know what? The only way you can do that is to do that on your own.", "Marah: What are you talking about?", "Jeffrey: I'm talking about your new life, marah, your new start. You're going to get on that plane to paris, and I'm not going to go with you. (Knocking at door)", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Danny! Danny, it's me, open up! (Pounding at door)", "Danny: Yeah.", "Bill: It's okay. Don't worry. I mean it, we're not going to take this lying down, all right? They want to call the election for ross? Let them. It's not going to stick. We're going to demand another recount.", "Danny: Will you just calm down for a second?", "Bill: Hey, look, I already spoke to michelle. We're going to hold a press conference, all right? I got... I roughed out the talking points of your statement right here, okay? Now, the key here is not to give an inch. You're going to look right into the camera and you're going to tell the people, \"hey, don't worry,\" all right? \"This is not over.\"", "Danny: But it is over, bill.", "Bill: What?", "Danny: I'm conceding to ross.", "Bill: No, you're not...", "Danny: He's the new mayor.", "Bill: Danny, you are not going to concede. You will not concede! You can win this thing.", "Danny: We have to let the town move on. You want a drink?", "Bill: Danny. What are you... you don't just give up.", "Danny: Why not?", "Bill: Well, first of all, you are not a quitter, okay? And there's no reason to concede. Look, we're going to fight this thing together, and we will set the record straight. You didn't lose. This election was taken from you.", "Danny: The recount was certified, right?", "Bill: Yeah, but...", "Danny: And it went to ross. Then I lost.", "Bill: Danny, if you don't set the record straight-- listen to me-- if you don't set the record straight, people are going to think it's right the way it is. Oh, my god. Tell me you didn't buy those votes.", "Danny: I didn't say that.", "Bill: You're not denying it, either. Danny, come on. Tell me you did not rig this election. Oprah: Men with wives", "Danny: Bill, go home.", "Bill: Danny, what is going on here? I know you. I know you'd never do something like this.", "Danny: You can either e-mail me the concession speech or I'll just write it myself, okay?", "Bill: You bought the votes. I mean, that'S... that's what you're implying here. Well, then there's got to be proof. I want to see it. Show it to me.", "Danny: (Sighs) bill, this is... this is...", "Bill: No, no, danny. You don't get off without answering me, not after everything I've been through with you-- for you. I mean, I don't know why you want me to believe these rumors, but I am not buying it.", "Danny: Buy it, don't buy it. I really... I don't care.", "Bill: So, what are you telling me, vote rigging is par for the course now? It's just another campaign tool?", "Danny: I didn't run to lose, bill.", "Bill: Well, that doesn't mean that you go and you steal...", "Danny: Politics is a business, and when you come in second, it's bad business. You wind up with nothing. It's winner takes all, bill. I did what I had to do to win. It just didn't work out.", "Bill: Danny, you can go to prison for this.", "Danny: No, actually, doing time does not serve the best interests of my family, so I am laying down, officially.", "Bill: What are you saying? You cut a deal?", "Danny: Bill, the less you know about it, the better-- for you.", "Bill: I mean, I was with you from day one of this campaign. I sacrificed so much of my time, my energy, my money. I honestly believed that you were the man for the job, and i got thousands of people to believe it, too.", "Danny: I didn't think they'd be enough.", "Bill: You didn't think they'd be enough, so what? You go out and you buy a few hundred votes? This is unbelievable. Meanwhile, I'm out there, \"hey, danny santos for mayor! The man who turned his life around, left crime behind!\" Well, it looks like you fooled everyone, danny, and then you made me look like the biggest fool of them all.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eden: It can't be true. Danny has worked so hard to break away from that, that... that mob way of doing things.", "Harley: Well, you know, sometimes you just can't escape who you are, or where you're from. I'm going to call blake, and i am going to try to find a newspaper.", "Eden: Okay. (Cell phone rings) hello?", "Salerno: How's the bride-to- be?", "Eden: Vinnie, how did you get this number?", "Salerno: I've got to keep track of you. We have unfinished business, business we need to discuss.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ed: All right, look, you are loyal to danny. My priority is you, and I can't stand to think of you having to go through another crisis.", "Michelle: Danny couldn't have done this, dad. I know. I know he didn't do it.", "Ed: For a fact? You know that for a fact?", "Michelle: Yes! My eyes are wide open when it comes to danny santos.", "Ed: And you never saw him do anything suspicious? I mean, even questionable?", "Michelle: Never, never. Dad, danny threw himself into this race heart and soul, and it brought out the best man that he could be. I'm telling you, somebody's got to be setting him up.", "Ed: Well, ross wouldn't do that.", "Michelle: No, of course, not. Of course, not. Boy, I really wish that you would jump to danny's defense as quick as you do ross'. (Sighs) I've got to go home.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marah: Jeffrey, you have to come with me. You said that you would.", "Jeffrey: I said a lot of things the last few days, marah, and nothing is more important than what I'm going to tell you right now. This is a trip, this is a journey that you have to make on your own.", "Marah: So, what, you knew the whole time that you weren't going to come with me? You've been lying to me? You're sending me away?", "Jeffrey: I just thought that this trip should be about you healing, that's all.", "Marah: Yeah. Yeah, it's supposed to be. So, why are you trying to cause me more pain?", "Jeffrey: Try to understand.", "Marah: How am I supposed to understand? It doesn't even make any sense!", "Jeffrey: You're going to be fine, you ave.", "Marah: No, jeffrey. I can't do this by myself.", "Jeffrey: You've got to change your thinking there, marah. Not only can you do it by yourself, but you have to do it by yourself. It's the only way it's going to count.", "Marah: Jeffrey, you're the one that I come to with all of my problems. You're the one that makes everything better. How can I do this without you? I never would have gotten through the past few weeks if it wasn't for you.", "Jeffrey: That was an emergency, marah. That's over now. You're safe now. You're safe to do whatever you want, to explore your own world.", "Marah: No, I don't want to do that alone.", "Jeffrey: Do you know how rare it is? Do you know how rare it is to consciously change your life like you're going to do, you know, just to make a clean break? There's no limit to what you can do or where you can go.", "Marah: I want to do that with you.", "Jeffrey: We've gone as far as we can go, marah.", "Marah: Jeffrey, don't say that, please.", "Jeffrey: Why? Because you want romance? You want passion? You're going to have that. You're going to have all that. But you need to be whole first, you know? And you're not. You're not whole yet.", "Marah: But you make me whole.", "Jeffrey: No, no, no. No one can do that for anyone else. You have to do that for yourself. You're the only one that can heal yourself. You've got this world of possibilities that are opening up for you, you know? You're going to choose the right ones and you're going to learn what's right for you. You are, little by little. And that's how you'll become whole again, darling, little by little.", "Marah: Fine. Fine. If you don't want to go to paris, that's fine. I won't go, either. Because I can't go without you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alexandra: So, you don't think that diamond earrings and, what, a trip to europe are suitable gifts for graduation for lizzie?", "Sandy: Well, suitable? Yeah, sure. But too easy.", "Alexandra: Well, you know, the graduation is very important to everyone in this family. We want to show her just how proud we are of her.", "Sandy: Okay. And then what?", "Alexandra: What what? (Laughs)", "Sandy: Well, you could give her the earrings, the trip to europe, she has a fabulous time. She comes back, and it's the big letdown.", "Alexandra: Well, no. Then it's time for college.", "Sandy: You hope. Lizzie's the kind of kid-- young person-- who needs structure. As her director, this is what I've noticed. Now, she may buck the rules every now and then, but having structure makes her happy, and a tangible challenge does, too. That's why she's doing so well right now. If you send her off, you take the chance she may-- excuse the term-- whack out again.", "Alexandra: Oh, well, what do you suggest I do to keep her from whacking out?", "Sandy: I suggest you put her straight to work. You and your family run a big business, ms. Spaulding. Bring lizzie on board.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eden: There's nothing left between us, vinnie.", "Salerno: Oh, I think you know there is. You owe me, and I'm just calling to remind you that I will collect.", "Harley: They have run a front-page story about danny that's based on rumors. And guess what? All the rumors come from \"anonymous sources.\" I mean, there's not a hard fact in this thing except that the recount went to marler. They should call this thing the \"daily innuendo.\" Eden?", "Eden: Huh?", "Harley: Where were you, in the garden or in the bridal shop?", "Eden: I was thinking about bill.", "Harley: Oh, well, don't worry about bill. I don't even see his name in here at all, and that's pretty good considering all's fair in the rumor mill. I hope they come out of this okay. I mean, this is a big mess. Danny, michelle and bill, of course.", "Eden: Me, too. I just want everything to be okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: Bill, come on. Don't take it so personally.", "Bill: You know, I sat in on every strategy session, every policy meeting. You and I put together a master plan that laid out every aspect of your campaign for mayor.", "Danny: It was a damn good plan.", "Bill: Yeah? Well, then what part of it was bogus, because obviously you can't believe in what we stood for, since that was honesty, integrity.", "Danny: We stood for progress.", "Bill: Danny, is that what this is? No. You made what we did a lie.", "Danny: Oh, bill, come on! All campaigns are a lie. Now, they're a manipulation. The whole point of a campaign is to make people think that someone is the right person for the job. You make them think it. Why do you think we staged photo ops and interviews, and you leaked stories...", "Bill: What are you talking about? That is not the same as stealing an election, danny.", "Danny: You bought votes every single day. You just didn't use money. Now, you know what your problem is, bill? You want in on the game real bad, but you insist on turning a blind eye to how it's played.", "Bill: Oh, dirty?", "Danny: Hard.", "Bill: Yeah, well, if you think this is the way the game is played, huh? You try to win no matter what it costs you?", "Danny: It's not going to cost me anything. I told you, I cut a deal.", "Bill: Yeah, well, now I'm talking about michelle. Yeah, that's right.", "Danny: What about michelle?", "Bill: Well, you should have heard her before, sticking up for you. I was so proud of her. Now, danny, I'm nothing but ashamed for her. This is going to tear her apart when she finds out.", "Danny: But she's not going to find out. The terms of my deal say that if I don't contest the election, all of this will go away. None of those rumors will be confirmed. So, she won't find out unless you tell her-- and then you'd be the one to tear michelle apart, bill. Not exactly something a good friend would do, is it?", "Bill: So, you're just going to leave her in the dark, huh? Is that it? Again?", "Danny: Bill, you know what? Look, I don't have to like the way things have fallen into place, but I intend to move on with my life. I suggest you do the same.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: Hey. Why is this happening?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: You think I like doing this? Do you think I want to give you up? Do you think I want to send you away? Marah, I hate it.", "Marah: Then why are you doing it? If it's not what either of us want?", "Jeffrey: If you don't get on the plane, marah, you're going to regret it, that's why.", "Marah: No. I won'T. Not if I get to be with you.", "Jeffrey: You can't be with me! I cannot be with you! (Sighs) do you remember when we first got together?", "Marah: Yeah, it was great.", "Jeffrey: It was great, but it was a time out of time, remember? It was a gift that we gave each other. That's what we said. That's what we said this was going to be. That's what we said on new year's eve.", "Marah: Well, I still feel like it's a gift.", "Jeffrey: Well, that's all going to change.", "Marah: Why?", "Jeffrey: Because you met me a little too early, and I met you a little too late.", "Marah: But that'S... that's what paris is supposed to be about. We can start our relationship fresh again and come back here and be together.", "Jeffrey: Our time together is over, marah.", "Marah: Will you stop saying that?", "Jeffrey: I won't forget it.", "Marah: Right. So you just want me to.", "Jeffrey: No, I don't want you to forget it. I want you to just... I want you to go on and I want you to make new memories, marah. You're going to make new memories, and they're going to be better memories.", "Skycap: The bags are loaded, sir. The passengers and crew are ready for departure.", "Jeffrey: Great. Thank you.", "Marah: The passengers?", "Jeffrey: Your parents are on the plane.", "Marah: My parents are on the plane?", "Jeffrey: Yeah, I told them what I was doing. They agreed with me and they, you know, they wanted to be there for you, help you get settled in paris.", "Marah: Get settled? And I thought I was done with the secrets and lies. That, please, marah. It's not a betrayal. I just thought I would wait for the last minute to tell you. It was the only way to convince you to go.", "Marah: Well, I'm not convinced.", "Jeffrey: I wanted to give you this. It's a chinese symbol for \"harmony.\" And when you wear it, I want you to remember that it means it's going to bring you peace and balance for the most important person in the world. And that's you.", "Marah: Jeffrey, I can't do this. It's too hard.", "Jeffrey: You're already doing it. You are. You know how I know? Because when I looked at you when you were reading that telegram that mindy sent you, you were so excited, you were so happy. I'd never seen you like that, never. You know? You had so much joy on your face. Do you remember when you first learned about paris? Didn't it seem like your whole future was just opening up for you? Well, that's the proof right there, marah. That's the proof that you are healing, you are starting to heal, and I didn't have anything to do with that. That was you. That was your life force inside of you telling you that you have to go on to new things. Without me.", "Marah: (Sobs) no, please.", "Jeffrey: You're amazing, you know? You're going to be amazing.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alexandra: So, you think lizzie should just be tossed right onto the corporate fast track right out of high school, huh?", "Sandy: I think lizzie needs a sense of purpose.", "Alexandra: Yes, well, you know, she has worked for the company before and... well, as an intern, although I don't get that she was particularly taken with the family business.", "Sandy: Well, aside from being beautiful, you're also a smart woman, and I'm sure you could create something to help lizzie and the company. Big corporations are getting a bad reputation these days, right? Good pr is never a bad thing, right?", "Alexandra: Not at all.", "Sandy: So maybe you could come up with something to help lizzie and the company by setting up something to give spaulding that good pr. And who better to run whatever it is than young elizabeth spaulding, mogul in the making?", "Alexandra: (Laughs) well, I don't think lizzie's quite ready to run anything yet, but I like your thinking. A family project that brings good publicity to the company.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Hey, try not to worry so much about bill. He'll be fine. Okay? I'm going to call frank.", "Eden: Frank? Why?", "Harley: Because he's my brother, and I like to check in with him. Eden?", "Eden: Hm?", "Harley: Everything will be fine. It will be.", "Eden: Oh, I hope so.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: Honey...", "Michelle: I'm sorry.", "Danny: For what?", "Michelle: Sorry that I took so long. I just... I was talking to someone about all this.", "Danny: I'm sure a lot of people are talking about it.", "Michelle: It's so infuriating. Not to mention it's wrong, it's unfair, and you know what i think? I think we should sue the papers.", "Danny: Honey...", "Michelle: No, I'm serious. No, really. Until they come out with the so- called source. Are you okay?", "Danny: Fine.", "Michelle: Bill? What, did I miss something here?", "Bill: Kind of. But look, I think you and danny got a lot more to discuss than we do, so I'm just going to take off.", "Danny: Probably a good idea.", "Michelle: No, no, no, no, that's not a good idea. We've got a press conference here to plan. We have the strategy we have to map out.", "Bill: Well, you're going to have to do it without me. See you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: Go.", "Marah: I will.", "Jeffrey: Do it now. Do it and don't look back.", "Marah: You have so many instructions.", "Jeffrey: I've got a lot on my mind.", "Marah: What happens if something goes wrong or something happens?", "Jeffrey: Nothing's going to go wrong, marah. You're not going to need my help.", "Marah: I thought my mom was the psychic.", "Jeffrey: I know this because I know you.", "Marah: Do you know how much I'll miss you?", "Jeffrey: Go. The first step's the hardest, but you have to do it, okay? Just do it. Do it for yourself. Everything's going to be okay. Everything's going to be more than okay, I promise. Now, go.", "Marah: I love you.", "Jeffrey: I love you, too, marah.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Next, on \"guiding light\"...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: You don't look like someone who's lost something. You look like you've given up.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marah: What's best for me is you. You know you'll never be whole again without me.", "Jeffrey: No, I won'T.", "Marah: Then don't ever let me go."], "Transcript Author": ["By Boo"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYuE71j4tFg"}
