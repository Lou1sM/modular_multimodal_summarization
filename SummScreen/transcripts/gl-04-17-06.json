        "Frank, Mallet, and Harley enjoy some beers at Towers and talk about how long it has been since the three of them did this. Mallet asks Harley to make Dinah take some time off so that he can take her on a romantic getaway. Dinah slips some pills into a box of stuff that Gus is going through and he pockets them. Dinah sees him taking some later and tells him that she knows he gave his pills to Harley so she knows the ones that he is using aren't his. He gives her the pills but when Harley arrives and they go outside to talk he takes a pill out of Harley's purse. Harley tells Dinah to take some time off and a fuming Dinah agrees to help Alan-Michael get Spaulding back when she runs into him at the Beacon. She goes to her room and passionately kisses Mallet. Harley later realizes that Gus is still on the pills. Tammy and Jonathan are getting ready to celebrate the family dinner when Lizzie calls and tells Jonathan she wants him in her bed tonight. Jonathan makes up an excuse and goes to Company where he physically threatens Lizzie if she tries to come between he and Tammy. Coop hears the noise and rushes out and pulls Jonathan off of Lizzie. Lizzie tries to make Coop feel sorry for her and take her home but Ava insists that they both take her home. Ava tucks her into her bed and makes it clear that if Lizzie needs anything she should call her, not Coop. Lizzie says that seeing the two of them together makes her sick and she rushes to the bathroom to throw up. Tammy tells Marina that she wants to drop the restraining order and they discuss their love lives. Marina goes to Alan-Michael's room and they start to get passionate, until Alan-Michael tells her that she has to accept him for everything he is. When she can't he kicks her out telling her she has to accept \"all or nothing\"."

        "Jonathan: All right, let's not get all carried away. I saw your mother fingering the knife there a few times.",
        "Tammy: Okay, but she didn't pick it up, and that's a big step. She may not like it, but at least she is not fighting us anymore. What about me? Did I pass my test, too? I mean, I didn't go running for the hills.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, yeah. But you can still earn some extra credit.",
        "Tammy: Oh, really? How's that?",
        "Jonathan: Follow me in the back and I'll show you. ( Cell phone rings ) Hello.",
        "Lizzie: You and your stupid ideas.",
        "Jonathan: I don't have time to talk right now.",
        "Lizzie: Well, make time. Because I just followed your advice about Coop, and I actually pushed him closer to Ava. They are planning their trip to England right now as we speak.",
        "Jonathan: That's tough, but it's not my problem.",
        "Lizzie: I need you. I need to see you. I need you in my bed, Jonathan, tonight.",
        "Jonathan: No way.",
        "Lizzie: Find a way or I am going to tell Tammy everything that we did. I mean, everything. Did you hear what I just said?",
        "Tammy: Everything okay?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, yeah, it was my distributor. He gets all upset if you don't do the paperwork exactly right, so... but that can wait until tomorrow. I'm going to concentrate on you. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Tammy: It's spreading.",
        "Jonathan: Just turn it off.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, I was planning to since you're planning to concentrate on... Lizzie.",
        "Jonathan: What?",
        "Tammy: Lizzie. She hardly ever calls me. I wonder what is up?",
        "Jonathan: Forget about Lizzie.",
        "Tammy: Okay. Okay, no Lizzie. Not tonight. How's that, okay? Jonathan?",
        "Jonathan: You know what? I better call him back.",
        "Tammy: Now?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. New me, right? Trying to be the guy your mother won't hate. Trying to be responsible.",
        "Tammy: I don't know if I like responsible Jonathan, if he's going to leave me.",
        "Jonathan: Well, responsible Jonathan will come right back, he promises.",
        "Tammy: Okay. I'm going to hop in the shower. If you get back in a hurry, pay me a visit. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Lizzie: Hello.",
        "Jonathan: It's me.",
        "Lizzie: There you are. I knew you'd call me back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Okay. Let's see what we've got here. We've got one watch, male, black, and a pack of facial tissues. Hey, how are you?",
        "Dinah: Hey, can I have a hug.",
        "Gus: Sure. What's the matter?",
        "Dinah: I'm just having a hard day, yeah. Oh, that feels perfect, thank you.",
        "Gus: You all right?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I'll be all right. I'm glad to see you feeling better. I've got to go. It was nice seeing you.",
        "Gus: Same here.",
        "Dinah: Bye.",
        "Gus: All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: When was the last time-- here, cheers.",
        "Mallet: Cheers.",
        "Frank: When was the last time the three of us did this?",
        "Harley: Just the three of us? Ten, 12 years ago roughly.",
        "Frank: Well, let's not wait so long next time.",
        "Mallet: I hear that. Good idea, Frank. So, what's up? Tell me about you. Come on, how's Olivia? Ow!",
        "Frank: Did she just kick you under the table?",
        "Mallet: She never misses. I'll tell you, she's lethal with that thing.",
        "Frank: We're okay. We're going to take things a little slowly right now.",
        "Harley: Good idea.",
        "Frank: And I'm okay with that. But let's talk about you and Dinah.",
        "Mallet: Okay. Me and Dinah. Um... I want it to work. I mean, being with her is the first time I felt really good and hopeful, you know, and since... well, you know, for a long time.",
        "Harley: That's good, you should make it work.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I know. It's just lately she's kind of had this feeling, you know, that she's like second best.",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Mallet: Well, I keep trying to tell her that she is wrong, but maybe it is just not about me.",
        "Harley: It's about me.",
        "Mallet: Maybe a little bit about you. You know how that whole CEO thing went down? It kind of gives her a right to feel the way she is feeling. You know what I mean?",
        "Harley: No, no, I get it. You know, it's me.",
        "Frank: What is he talking about?",
        "Harley: It's just I swept in and I pushed her aside and... smart. No, but the problem, though, is that I'm probably the last person you should be turning to for help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I am so sick of being the one with my nose pressed up against the window like some three dollar puppy. It's getting kind of pathetic.",
        "Jonathan: You said it.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I said it. But it's not me, okay. Yes, I need some help. I need some help to feel better. I need a little bit of help to forget everything. That's all I'm asking, and then you can go back to Tammy and I will figure out how to deal with Ava on my own. I'm heading home. Meet me there, Jonathan, okay? Do you understand what I'm saying? I need you. I want you.",
        "Jonathan: Here I am.",
        "Lizzie: Jonathan, I...",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I know. But I'm here now Lizzie. So what's the rush?",
        "Zach: Hi, Gus!",
        "Gus: Hey, what's going on. What are you doing here?",
        "Zach: Uncle Rick brought me here to help him.",
        "Gus: He did? Well, what are you going to do?",
        "Zach: Can we play airplane until he gets back?",
        "Gus: Airplane, right now?",
        "Zach: Please?",
        "Gus: Please? Do we have to... can we do it when we get home later?",
        "Zach: Pick me up! Pick me up!",
        "Gus: Listen you, with this face. Okay, ready? Here we go. One... okay, we're going over the parking lot. We're going over the parking lot and we're going over the houses now. Look, we can see the whole neighborhood, and we're going... we're going out of juice. We've got no power. What happened? I don't know. I don't know what happened. Hey, look, there is Rick with his little brontosaurus-scope around his neck. Why don't you go ask him if you can listen to your own heartbeat. Come on. See you at home, Cap'!",
        "Dinah: Gus, you don't want to do that, believe me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Well, I mean, you're Dinah's friend. You might be her only friend.",
        "Harley: Uh-huh, yeah. I want to be her friend. I want to be her friend. But I'm a part of the problem, a really big part.",
        "Mallet: Well, I mean, it's just not you, Cooper. It's just also that she just lost her father. And I don't know, things are just piling up. I've been trying to get her to say yes to getting away someplace. You know, like, let's go away for a week for, I don't know, a cabin in the mountains or something.",
        "Frank: A cabin is a bad idea. Mountains, no. Yeah, you want to think more, like palm trees, suntan lotion, you know, like, rubbing it all over her body.",
        "Mallet: I like that. Yeah, I like that.",
        "Harley: How about a spa? I think a spa would be good.",
        "Frank: Spa's good.",
        "Harley: They're always fun and, you know... but too expensive though. Well, expensive or you can go cheapskate.",
        "Mallet: Okay, I guess I can handle a few mud baths. I just want a chance to show her, you know... ( laughs ) It's kind of weird.",
        "Harley: No, it's weird.",
        "Mallet: It's just weird talking to you about this.",
        "Harley: It's weird talking to you about it.",
        "Mallet: It's kind of weird. Why don't you help me out then?",
        "Harley: I'm trying. You want me to book the reservation for you?",
        "Mallet: No. Why don't you clear her schedule?",
        "Frank: That's good. You can help him with that, right? That's a good idea.",
        "Harley: Well, guys, I tried that and she refused to take some time off.",
        "Mallet: Force her. You're the boss. Come up with some excuse. Just tell her not to come in.",
        "Frank: Well, try.",
        "Harley: All right. I'll do... I'll... ( scoffs ) Somehow. I'll think of something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Jonathan? Hello! Where are you? \"Be right back.\" Okay, I might as well just... oh, wait a minute. Marina, hey, are you busy right now? Good, because I need to see you right away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: You know, it's weird. I spent most of my life living in England, and I never once made it to Stonehenge or got a chance to see the Tower of London. But you know what? That's kind of the way it is, though. When you live someplace, you never really do the touristy things, right? You know what? I think it's actually a good thing.",
        "Ava: Why?",
        "Coop: Well, because that means that I can go see these places for the first time with you.",
        "Ava: Good answer.",
        "Coop: Thank you very much. I thought you'd like that.",
        "Ava: I do thank you.",
        "Coop: Good, I'm glad.",
        "Ava: Can I tell you a secret?",
        "Coop: Let me guess. You get freaked out by Stonehenge. I understand.",
        "Ava: No. I'm jealous of Lizzie.",
        "Coop: Ava, we've been through this. There's nothing...",
        "Ava: It's not because I think she's going to get back together with you or anything like that.",
        "Coop: So what's this about then?",
        "Ava: It's about what she already has: The history with you. It's like she... she knows the little things.",
        "Coop: Okay. So you and I we're learning about each other. I mean, you... frankly, you're full of surprises, all right? But that's okay because...",
        "Ava: Me?",
        "Coop: ...I'm learning about these things.",
        "Ava: No, I'm totally an open book.",
        "Coop: No, you are not totally an open anything. Look, I didn't even know... it took me to this point to realize what your favorite snack is.",
        "Ava: Yeah?",
        "Coop: Yeah.",
        "Ava: Well, maybe you should spend some time with me hanging out at bedtime.",
        "Coop: Maybe I should. It's been a big mistake not.",
        "Ava: You want to see what I do at bedtime?",
        "Coop: I... yeah. Well, I'd kind of like to taste...",
        "Ava: Try some of this.",
        "Coop: Okay.",
        "Ava: Open up.",
        "Coop: Uh-huh.",
        "Ava: Good right?",
        "Coop: Oh, that's good.",
        "Ava: I can't believe it's not butter.",
        "Coop: I can't believe it's that good.",
        "Ava: I know. I eat it every night.",
        "Coop: I can tell. So, all right. What is it you don't know about me?",
        "Ava: Well, lots of things. Like... I don't know what your favorite flavor of ice cream is. I don't know what your favorite sports team is. I didn't even know tomorrow was your birthday. I don't even know, actually, if you like birthdays. I don't even know how old you are. I don't even... you know, the list goes on and on. It's like she has this... this big part of you that she'll always have and it's always going to be that way. It's never going to change.",
        "Coop: Ava, please, look...",
        "Ava: No, listen. It's the truth, it's how I feel. And it's the way she acts.",
        "Coop: Okay. You're right. Lizzie owns part of my past. But she can have it, all right, because I am just focused on what's in front of me. All right? I'm just looking... I'm looking at you, and you are right in front of me.",
        "Ava: Yeah?",
        "Coop: Yes. Okay? Come on so, now that we got that whole thing settled, what should we do tonight? Hmmm?",
        "Ava: Oh, tonight. Well, we could go upstairs and check on the wall.",
        "Coop: I like that feeling. I like that that's there.",
        "Ava: I have a feeling that it's starting to crumble.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Tammy?",
        "Tammy: Marina.",
        "Marina: Hi. Oh, that's not for you, sorry.",
        "Tammy: Thanks.",
        "Marina: You know, indecent exposure is a crime. I thought you're not supposed to be here. There is a restraining order.",
        "Tammy: About that...",
        "Marina: You're back with Jonathan. So, why did you call me? To show off your back-in-love glow?",
        "Tammy: Tell me how I can get that restraining order lifted. Jonathan's going to be back in a few minutes, and I just really want all of this legal stuff cleared up as soon as possible.",
        "Marina: If you say so.",
        "Tammy: So, can you help me?",
        "Marina: Nope. You're going to have to go down to the station and take care of that yourself.",
        "Tammy: Okay. I will. As soon as possible. I just don't want anymore bad stuff to happen to us, you know?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Ooh, you do like it a little rough, don't you?",
        "Jonathan: Isn't that the way you want it?",
        "Lizzie: You know, I love the danger, J.B., but let's take it off the street. Coop and Stretch Armstrong are right inside.",
        "Jonathan: I thought thrills are what you're after.",
        "Lizzie: You might be all smiles with Tammy right now, but I'm looking to feel good, and you are more than qualified for the job. Anyway, it didn't take you too long to leave Tammy and come running... you're not here to hook up with me?",
        "Jonathan: What do I look like to you? One of your paid escort boys or your servants?",
        "Lizzie: I wish.",
        "Jonathan: You want something warm and cozy to come running when you call? Make nice with that ugly mutt. I am nobody's toy dog.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, but I have a collar that would look so cute on you.",
        "Jonathan: If I were you, I'd start backing off right now.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, yeah?",
        "Jonathan: You think you can take me on Lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: Who knows.",
        "Jonathan: I do. If you don't stay away from me and Tammy, I'll take this little necklace you're wearing and I'll wrap it real tight around your scrawny little neck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Well, there's nothing you can do about the restraining order tonight. You have to take care of it in the morning. So in the meantime, if I were you and your friend, I'd steer clear.",
        "Tammy: Got it. I thought he'd be back by now.",
        "Marina: Maybe he lost track of time at the pond biting the heads off of cute little ducklings.",
        "Tammy: Okay, just because you're miserable doesn't mean...",
        "Marina: I'm not miserable.",
        "Tammy: You gave up on Alan-Michael and now you're stuck.",
        "Marina: Oh. You think I miss Alan-Michael.",
        "Tammy: Please, you might as well wear a sign. You know, and I don't know why you gave up on him anyway. I mean, he's single, your single.",
        "Marina: There is more going on than that, okay. Alan-Michael practically declared war on my entire family. I'd like to ignore that small little fact, but I can't. Some relationships just aren't meant to be. Besides, I want something simpler this time around.",
        "Tammy: Well, good luck. Relationships take work. I mean, Jonathan and I, we had to fight my mom, half the town, even the courts. But if you love somebody...",
        "Marina: Tammy, don't get me wrong. I love you, okay? You are my bestest, most closest friend in the whole world, but when it comes to your taste in men...",
        "Tammy: What? I'm not your role model? Fine. But be happy, Marina. Whatever it takes, you deserve it.",
        "Marina: Well, thank you. Thank you for the good advice and the sodas. All right, I'm gonna get out of here before you know who comes back to his rose pedals.",
        "Tammy: Jerk.",
        "Marina: I'm glad that you're happy.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, me, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: What are you talking about? This is a prescription from Rick. This is taking the edge off my leg while I'm getting better. That's all.",
        "Dinah: That's not all. Look, I'm the last person in the world to be judging you right now. But I know that when you're in pain, it is very easy to fall back on a habit.",
        "Gus: I don't have a habit.",
        "Dinah: Okay. Whatever it is that you're calling this, you see, when you think you've got it kicked, it's gonna pop up again. And then you're going to do whatever it takes to take the edge off a little bit and then suddenly you're hurting people that you care about, but you can't think clearly enough to care.",
        "Gus: Dinah, I'm fine, honest.",
        "Dinah: Okay. If we're being honest with one another, then I should tell you that I know that you gave those pills back to Harley. So I know these aren't yours. Gus, you let them go. You listen to me. You let them go, it's the right thing to do.",
        "Harley: Wow, look who it is. Wow, the two of you together in one place. Lucky me. What's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: What am I doing? I'm done. Forget it. Right? I mean, that's... that's what I said. Wait. Why not? Just talk and find out. That'll settle it. Knock. ( Knock on the door ) If it's meant to be, he'll open the door, open his arms and... ( knock on the door ) Okay, I gave it my best shot. I guess it's not meant to be.",
        "Alan-Michael: What's not meant to be?",
        "Marina: Us.",
        "Alan-Michael: Us?",
        "Marina: Yeah, me, you. You, you. I knocked and you weren't there.",
        "Alan-Michael: No, I'm here.",
        "Marina: That's why you didn't answer.",
        "Alan-Michael: Not even someone with my special powers can answer the door when he's not home. But I could go in, shut the door behind me and you could try again. Or we could just skip a step and you could come in now. It's not a trick question. You want the choices again?",
        "Marina: No, I got it.",
        "Alan-Michael: Good. So now that we're both inside, hi.",
        "Marina: Hi.",
        "Alan-Michael: You're in the running for the last person I expected to see at my door this century. What brings you by? Did you want to go through my drawers again?",
        "Marina: No. It's nothing, really. I mean, I just wanted to, you know, see...",
        "Alan-Michael: Me?",
        "Marina: ...How you were doing.",
        "Alan-Michael: Without you?",
        "Marina: In general.",
        "Alan-Michael: I missed you.",
        "Marina: I missed you, too.",
        "Alan-Michael: I missed you so much.",
        "Marina: Me, too. Not that this means anything.",
        "Alan-Michael: You don't believe that.",
        "Marina: Sure. I mean, why not? You missed me, I missed you and I'm here, and you're... we're just two people that missed each other. I mean, it's just one night. Why does it have to be anything more than that? What?",
        "Alan-Michael: Out.",
        "Marina: What?",
        "Alan-Michael: You heard me, get out. Bye-bye. It's time to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: You needed me. I bailed you out of jail.",
        "Jonathan: I didn't ask for your help.",
        "Lizzie: But you needed me, and you needed me later on that night, too.",
        "Jonathan: Now I don't.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, so what? So that it means you're not going to help me now?",
        "Jonathan: I helped you plenty the other night.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, and I helped you, too. I helped you feel better when Tammy hurt you.",
        "Jonathan: So?",
        "Lizzie: So you might think that you might care a little bit about what I'm going through.",
        "Jonathan: It was sex, Lizzie. That's it. Forget it or you're going to be sorry.",
        "Lizzie: No. You are going to be sorry because if I call Tammy one more time...",
        "Jonathan: Who do you think I am? Coop? You think you can hold that night over my head and I'm going to worry about it? I am not afraid. I don't care about anything but Tammy. I don't care if you disappear off the face of this earth. I wonder if anyone else would even notice.",
        "Lizzie: I can't believe I ever let you touch me. I hope that Tammy lets go of you and I hope it's the real deal this time because...",
        "Jonathan: If you try and come between me and Tammy, I will think of something that will surprise you! Do you understand me?",
        "Lizzie: Yes, I do.",
        "Jonathon: Do you understand me?",
        "Lizzie: Yes, I do!",
        "Coop: Look, that's enough! Get the hell off of her, all right? All right!",

When I think about working on the longest-running television show in history, I think about the people who first started the show, and the dreams that they had for it, and the vision they had for it, and I can't imagine they had no idea how long this was going to go for. I think it's really exciting to be a part of those people's dreams. See Lizzie, Wednesday, April 19, \"Inside The Light\".",

        "Lizzie: Coop, keep him away from he. Did you see that look in his eyes? All I did was say that was Tammy was better off without him, which is true, and he just went crazy. I had no idea what he was going to do.",
        "Coop: All right, all right, look. I think you just need to take a walk, okay?",
        "Jonathan: You going to get fantastic Frank and the rest of the police force?",
        "Coop: I don't need them to deal with you.",
        "Jonathan: Ooh. Whatever you say, Henry. I think Lizzie and I understand each other, so good night, everybody. Sweet dreams, Liz.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, my God. Coop, thank God you were here. I don't know what would have happened. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.",

        "Marina: You want me to leave?",
        "Alan-Michael: Want? No. But ask me how much I like playing games?",

        "Alan-Michael: Not with you.",
        "Marina: Oh, you think I'm the one playing games?",
        "Alan-Michael: One minute you give me a big speech about how you can't trust me. The next minute you're at my door knocking, looking to get lucky. So what's the deal, Officer?",
        "Marina: Looking to get lucky? The deal?",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm being honest with you. Spaulding is my birthright. It's my family business. That makes it more mine than Harley's.",
        "Marina: Says you.",
        "Alan-Michael: I think most people would agree that it's a long time coming for me to have a shot at running the family business. What's so hard to understand Marina? How did your family feel when Phillip went after Company? Pretty awful, right? All I want is to keep the family business in the family. No. No, that's not all. I want you. No games, no lies. It's your call, Marina. Decide what you want, all or nothing. No in-betweens. Marina, all... or nothing?",

        "Dinah: Yeah, what's up?",
        "Harley: I'm making changes at the company. I'm going to change the whole structure of the company. I've already hired a firm to do a feasibility study, and then I'm meeting with the heads of the board and the heads of the division...",
        "Dinah: Okay, good. I think that's good.",
        "Harley: So if you're going to take some time off, this is your window.",
        "Dinah: Are you ordering me to go away? Is that what you're doing? Are you serious?",
        "Harley: I just think you should take some time off, okay. Enjoy yourself. If you're not going to do it for yourself, do it for me. Okay? ( Cell phone rings ) Let me just get this.",
        "Gus: I can't do this. It's about will power. Once my mind is made up, I keep it made up. I promised Harley. I promised.",

        "Tammy: Sure. Marina came by while you were gone.",
        "Jonathan: What did she want?",
        "Tammy: I called her to cancel the restraining order.",
        "Jonathan: Are you sure about that? Forbidden love is kind of hot.",
        "Tammy: We're hot enough on our own.",

        "Lizzie: So?",
        "Ava: So his mind's on her, honey, not you.",
        "Lizzie: Then why wasn't he with her, honey? Come on. You know how crazy he is, Coop.",
        "Coop: More crazy or less crazy than Joey Lupo, the last guy I had to protect you from?",
        "Lizzie: This is for real. You saw Jonathan.",
        "Coop: What did you do to provoke him, Lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: Nothing. He just hates me because I have it all and he has nothing.",
        "Ava: He has Tammy, and that's a lot.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, yeah. How long is that going to last? You know what, I told him... okay, I told him that he was a loser, but that's the truth. And I told him that Tammy was better off without him in her life. Again, the truth. Maybe he's worried that I'm going to call her and try to convince her that she's making a horrible decision, which she is.",
        "Ava: Well, it's a good thing you didn't say anything to deliberately provoke him.",
        "Lizzie: What do I have to do? Do I have to get on my knees? You saw what happened. Please, I'm really afraid. You can't let me go home by myself.",

        "Mallet: That's good news. I can't believe that. How did you manage that?",
        "Harley: I have absolutely no idea. Have you thought about where you're going to take her?",
        "Mallet: No, not yet. I'm thinking about some stuff. I'm looking into some spas.",
        "Harley: Good man.",
        "Mallet: Why? Because I listened to you?",
        "Harley: Of course. No. I want you to make it a vacation that she'll never forget.",

You've got enough fuel in you? Look, we're going over the parking lot, we're going over the ocean. I'm asking you a question, can you see the ocean? Look, you can see mommy's head.
