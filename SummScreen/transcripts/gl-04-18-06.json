        "Blake blames Jeffrey for the story about Ross and the affair with his assistant as a way to get her to lose the election. Frank finds out more facts about the crash, and wonders if someone was trying to murder Ross. He later asks Gus to investigate. Billy tells Josh that he was the one who arranged to have the divorce papers delivered to Reva. Olivia refuses to sell Josh Cross Creek, but later Cassie offers to sell her half of the Beacon if she will sell it to her and Olivia agrees. Harley has Rick talk to Gus about the pills he is taking and Gus resents that Harley doesn't trust him, but she points out that she knows he went through her purse.",
        "Olivia chats with Buzz at Company, but their talking is very intimate. It's clear that she can really communicate well with him, even though she says she has chosen Frank. She thanks him for helping Frank woo her, and he kisses her hand just as Frank walks up and sees them. Frank brushes Buzz off when he wants to make up. Josh can't convince Olivia to sell him Cross Creek, but Cassie convinces her to sell it in exchange for her half of The Beacon. Josh gets excited about restoring the place to the way it used to be. Cassie invites herself along to help out. Billy gets angry when he finds out that Josh and Reva are back together. He lets Josh know that he is the one that let Reva find the papers; the two brothers argue about Reva.",
        "Harley forces Gus to have leg checked out by Rick, who says it is healing. They are both worried about Gus' pill-popping, and Reva confronts him about the bottle of pills that have been moved in her purse. Gus claims he is fine and gets angry at Harley for going behind his back to Rick and accusing him, but they make up. A tabloid newspaper article has photos of Ross and his personal assistant. Blake accuses Jeffrey of planting it, but he denies it. She is very vulnerable and hurting, and Jeffrey seems to feel sorry for her (and perhaps something more). An FAA Agent gives Frank info about the crash-- it was not an accident. Frank tells Jeffrey, who phones someone about it and finds out that Ross' personal assistant, Nikki, was a private eye. Frank gives the file to Gus to investigate but doesn't want to tell Blake yet. Frank is a little concerned about Gus' leg but gives him a chance after Gus pleads with him."

        "Harley: How many were in here? How many did you actually take?",
        "Gus: Look, ma, caneless!",
        "Harley: Why?",
        "Gus: Why? Because I lent my cane to an old lady. She needed it more than me. Because I'm good, I'm fine.",
        "Harley: You look better.",
        "Gus: Thank you, yeah. I'm going to go stickless. I decided. I'm mostly going to say to everybody who comes across me I'm going to go say, \"I'm going to put one foot in front of the other one.\" It's going to be my new motto: One day at a time.",
        "Harley: You look good, let's try out that leg. Come on.",
        "Gus: Sure.",
        "Harley: Just a little... I knew it. I knew it. I knew it.",
        "Gus: I'm fine.",
        "Harley: You're not fine.",
        "Gus: I am fine.",
        "Harley: Okay, I believe you, you're fine. But I'd like a doctor to confirm that.",
        "Gus: Oh, my God. You're going to drag me to a doctor?",
        "Harley: Gus, we're just going to talk to a doctor and then we can move on from this, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Busy day?",
        "Buzz: Oh, I've had worse and I've had better. You?",
        "Olivia: So far, so good. How are things with Frank?",
        "Buzz: I wouldn't know. I haven't seen him since the charity gala the other night.",
        "Olivia: He is your son. We have to fix this.",
        "Buzz: We, as in you and me? That's what started this in the first place, wasn't it?",
        "Josh: Excellent, you're here. Could you excuse us for just a second, Buzz? Thank you. Did you get my message by any chance?",
        "Olivia: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "Josh: I'm very serious about this offer, okay?",
        "Olivia: I get that, I get that. And your desire to buy Cross Creek as a surprise for Reva is surpassed only by my desire not to facilitate that. In other words, no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Hey, Blake, how you holding up?",
        "Blake: I'm fine, I'm fine.",
        "Billy: I hear you're thinking about running for mayor.",
        "Blake: I'm not thinking about it, I am running. And I'm going to win. You pig!",
        "Jeffrey: Blake.",
        "Blake: Shut up, Jeffrey. I was going to call you so we can set up some ground rules for this race, keep it marginally respectable.",
        "Jeffrey: What are you talking... okay, wait a minute, what do you think that I...",
        "Blake: I think you've already dragged this campaign into the stinking gutter.",

        "Golson: Chief Cooper?",
        "Frank: Yeah?",
        "Golson: Dan Golson. Thanks for meeting me.",
        "Frank: Hey, any time an FAA agent calls me, I'm here to listen. Please, sit down.",
        "Golson: Thank you.",
        "Frank: You know, you were pretty tight-lipped on that phone. I assume it's in reference to Ross Marler's plane crash.",
        "Golson: Yes. And I'm here to deal with fact, not fiction.",
        "Frank: I know. Can you believe this garbage?",
        "Golson: This may prove more interesting reading.",
        "Frank: What do you got? Oh, my God.",
        "Golson: It's all very preliminary, of course.",
        "Frank: The plane crash may not have been an accident? What are you saying? Are you saying that Ross Marler was murdered?",
        "Rick: Hey.",
        "Gus: Hey, I was just about to give up on you.",
        "Rick: Well, I just spoke to the orthopedist about your x-rays.",
        "Gus: Yeah?",
        "Harley: Good news?",
        "Rick: Yeah, good news. Your kne... your leg is healing. Slowly but surely it's healing.",
        "Gus: You almost said my knee. Okay, so we can go, right?",
        "Harley: You wanted to do a follow-up with him.",
        "Rick: It will just take a couple of minutes, just a couple of questions.",
        "Harley: I'm going to go and talk to the nurse and finish up that paperwork.",
        "Gus: I'm coming with you.",
        "Harley: No, no, no, you stay here. I'll be gone one minute. I'll be right back.",
        "Rick: Sit down. Go ahead.",
        "Gus: Okay.",
        "Rick: It will just take a second. Is your leg okay in that position?",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Rick: So, when you're experiencing this pain, how long does it generally last?",
        "Gus: It comes and goes. It's not a big deal, right?",
        "Rick: What about the pain medication?",
        "Gus: What about it?",
        "Rick: Well, Harley told me you stopped taking it cold turkey.",
        "Gus: I did.",
        "Rick: Were you experiencing some problems with it? Were you nauseated, were you disoriented?",
        "Gus: No. She expressed a concern, so I just stopped taking it.",
        "Rick: Okay. So, would you say since you stopped taking this medication, would you describe the pain as being worse or has it moderated?",
        "Gus: I never really gave it much thought.",
        "Rick: All right, Gus, let me just put it this way: Does the pain make you think you stopped taking the medication too soon. What?",
        "Gus: I get it.",
        "Rick: Get what? What's so funny?",
        "Gus: It isn't about me or my leg, right? It's about the medication, right?",
        "Rick: No...",
        "Gus: This whole little thing is a setup, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Okay...",
        "Olivia: How many different ways do I have to say, \"no?\" Now, I can try it in Spanish or French, but it's still going to sound the same. ( Spoken in three different accents ) no, no, no.",
        "Josh: Just hear me out, please.",
        "Olivia: You know, I get that you want to buy Reva a nice gift. Okay, that's great. The fruit of the month club is fabulous. Cross Creek is mine.",
        "Josh: Olivia, I know how you feel about Reva and me, and about me and about Reva.",
        "Olivia: Do you?",
        "Josh: And I apologize if somehow I gave you a false sense of hope when Reva and I were separated. But luckily we didn't go too far.",
        "Olivia: Luckily.",
        "Josh: So we dated, right, and it didn't work out, and that's it. No harm, no foul.",
        "Olivia: Listen, I'm not selling Cross Creek, okay? Phillip stole it from you and left it for me, fair and square.",
        "Josh: Olivia, you don't go there. You don't even like going there. You are only doing this because you want to stick it to me and Reva, and why would you do that? Obviously, you've moved on, you and Frank seem to be doing fine.",
        "Olivia: We're doing better than fine.",
        "Josh: And that's so wonderful. It really touches my heart. Share the happiness.",
        "Olivia: Joshua, happiness comes from within. You know that.",
        "Josh: No, actually... ( cell phone rings ) Yeah? Yeah. Wanda, honey, if this is so important, why am I just finding out about it now? Okay, yes, I'll be there. Thank you. I have to go. But we will finish this conversation.",
        "Olivia: No, no, no. We're finished. You have a good meeting.",
        "Cassie: Nice work. He just left. ( Laughs ) Thanks, Wanda, I owe you one. Hi, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: What is this, a marathon? I'm going to tell you what I told Josh: No dice on Cross Creek.",
        "Cassie: Hold on a second, partner. You haven't heard what I'm putting on the table.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Golson: Now, we've been examining the wreckage, trying to pull data off the black box. Nothing is conclusive, but there are enough indicators to tag Mr. Marler's crash suspicious.",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, pending a full FAA investigation, right?",
        "Golson: Right. Now, I assume the FBI will contact you about the murder angle. Although the crash was in a different jurisdiction, this was his home. You knew Mr. Marler, his family, his associates. If you happen to come across any information that could shed light on what happened to him, we would appreciate you sharing.",
        "Frank: Yeah, no, absolutely. Yeah, if I find out anything, I'll let you know.",
        "Golson: I'll do the same.",
        "Frank: Dan, thank you for this.",
        "Golson: Yeah. I don't need to remind you, but be careful who you show it to.",
        "Frank: Yeah, Blakey. I'm thinking whether or not Ross fooled around on you isn't your biggest problem anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: My kids saw this. Their friends that go to school with them saw this. It's bad enough they lost their father, but now...",
        "Jeffrey: Blake, it's a tabloid. Inventing facts is what they do.",
        "Blake: They have pictures, they have quotes from an anonymous source who claims that Ross was having an affair.",
        "Jeffrey: I would defend myself, but you are convinced I that I did this.",
        "Blake: Of course I am. Of course you planted this story because you would do anything to be elected mayor. You as much as said so.",
        "Jeffrey: Smearing Ross would be a monumentally stupid part on my part. Excuse me. This only makes you look more sympathetic, Blake. Think about it. \"Poor, bereaved Blake left alone by her womanizing husband to tend to her three kids all by herself. Every voter who has ever been cheated on or let down is going to take you for their personal savior.",
        "Blake: You didn't do this? You're saying you wouldn't stoop this low?",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, no, I would, but I didn't. I don't need a bag of dirty tricks to win this election.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Hey, you looking for somebody?",
        "Josh: Yeah, Peter Tingley. Wanda called me, said I had a meeting with him I didn't know about, said he would be waiting for me here.",
        "Billy: I haven't seen Pete. I haven't seen much of you, either. How you doing?",
        "Josh: Great. Fine.",
        "Billy: Things have been a little tough between you and me, but I still want you to know we're still brothers.",
        "Josh: Are you working up to something here?",
        "Billy: How did it go when you and Reva met with the mediator?",
        "Josh: Oh, right. We haven't had a chance to talk about that.",
        "Billy: I know. Signing the divorce papers couldn't be easy for anybody. It probably worked out best for everybody.",
        "Josh: Yeah. Billy, there is something you need to know. Reva and I, we did sign the divorce papers, but then we tore them up. In fact, we shredded them into little bits of confetti and threw them off the top of the lighthouse.",
        "Billy: What happened?",
        "Josh: What happened? Well, we were standing there on the brink of divorce again, and we decided not to go through with it. That's what happened. We're going to take our time, but we're going to give our marriage another shot. Look, I'm sorry. I know that is not what you expected to hear or what you wanted to hear, Billy. But, hey, we're still brothers, right?",
        "Billy: Oh, that's real funny.",
        "Josh: Billy, I'm sorry. I know that you were hoping that you and Reva would get a little bit closer, but you've got to understand, we're destined to be together.",
        "Billy: Yeah, right. Reva and Josh together til the end of time.",
        "Josh: We're going to have to talk about this later. But just for the record, I really hope that all of us can get back to the way things were.",
        "Billy: And how was it? Josh and Reva together, and Billy was on the outside.",
        "Josh: Billy, stop...",
        "Billy: Stop, that's the message I've been getting all along.",
        "Josh: I know you thought you had another chance, but the divorce papers was a mistake, it was a fluke. I never meant for it to happen.",
        "Billy: Josh, that wasn't a mistake. I made it happen. I put those papers so that Reva would be able to see them-- me. And you know something, I would do it again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: So what about you? I'm sure you're digging up some dirt on me, aren't you? Have you talked to your good friend Cassie yet?",
        "Blake: I've been a little busy dealing with the grief of losing my husband. Besides, Cassie didn't give me anything on you.",
        "Jeffrey: Aha. ( Laughs ) You're really going to play that grieving widow card, aren't you?",
        "Blake: This is not a card I'm playing. Losing the love of my life is not a strategy for me.",
        "Jeffrey: Look, I didn't mean...",
        "Blake: It's not a game, O'Neill. I wake up every single morning in a bed that I used to share with Ross. I have three kids who have no father, and now I have this. I tried so hard to make myself believe that this wasn't true.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, Blake. You don't know that it is.",
        "Blake: And then I tried really hard just to make myself believe that it just doesn't matter. And now you know what? I don't know what to believe. If I got into this race to honor Ross, and if any of this is remotely true, then what does that make me? Nah, don't even answer that.",
        "Frank: Blake? What happened to her? What's the matter with her? Yeah, I know. And guess what, there is more to come.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: You wanted Reva to get those divorce papers?",
        "Billy: Look, the only accident was that I ran into your lawyer and he told me what he had been sitting on. I just thought I would make use of them, that's all.",
        "Josh: What, by pushing me and Reva to the brink of divorce?",
        "Billy: It's not like you didn't want that. You had them drawn up.",
        "Josh: Billy, that was months ago. I was angry.",
        "Billy: I thought I would just remind you. Excuse me.",
        "Josh: Billy, why... why would you do something like that to us?",
        "Billy: Look, I wanted you guys to get off the fence. On again, off again, hurting each other, making each other miserable. How long was that going to take...",
        "Josh: As long as it took Reva and I to figure out what we wanted.",
        "Billy: Well, suppose it takes you your whole life?",
        "Josh: So what?",
        "Bill: Well, I just thought it was time to fish or cut bait, little brother. And by gosh, something needed to happen.",
        "Josh: Billy, do you honestly believe that Reva and I don't belong together?",
        "Billy: Look, I was the biggest fan of Josh and Reva. But I'm thinking that maybe it's a fairy tale we all bought into.",
        "Josh: I don't believe that.",
        "Billy: You know what, I think this is going to happen all over again. Wait, wait, wait. You're right, I said my peace. You're right. You and Reva are back together, and that's it. But I wonder how long it's going to last this time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: But this is crazy.",
        "Cassie: No, no, not to me it's not.",
        "Olivia: You would sell me your half of the Beacon if I sell you Cross Creek.",
        "Cassie: Which I then turn around and sell to Josh, yes. But don't get me wrong, this isn't charity. I want my full market value for my share.",
        "Olivia: I'm just trying to figure out why you would do this.",
        "Cassie: Because I need a change.",
        "Olivia: After Jeffrey?",
        "Cassie: And Edmund and Sandy and Tammy and Jonathan and Reva. I've been through it this year, if you haven't noticed. I need to simplify. I want to be a better mother and I want to be a better friend. And I want a little independence.",
        "Olivia: But you love the Beacon.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I do. But I love my life and I love my family more.",
        "Olivia: So this is not just about doing Josh a favor.",
        "Cassie: I'm the one who gets the prize.",
        "Olivia: No, Reva gets the prize, as usual.",
        "Cassie: What do you care? You are not after Josh anymore. So suck up your pride and sign the deal. You get a great deal out of this.",
        "Olivia: The deal is good, but the terms are all wrong, Cassie. Wait. Where you going?",
        "Cassie: This is not a negotiation, Olivia. Take it or leave it.",
        "Josh: Wanda, I don't know what happened, either. All I can tell you is that Peter never showed. So much for our important meeting.",
        "Cassie: Well, we can have an important meeting because, ooh, have I got a surprise for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Gus, wait a second.",
        "Gus: I heard what you said, all right. You and Harley have a thing, you talk behind my back...",
        "Rick: No. You said just a moment ago she has a right to be concerned. About what?",
        "Gus: I don't understand. I don't understand what you're getting at.",
        "Rick: What I'm trying to get at, Gus, is these drugs are a mixed blessing. They are great tools for healing, but if you don't respect their power, you can get addicted very, very fast.",
        "Gus: Yeah, yeah...",
        "Rick: I'm not just blowing smoke. Hear me out. When I was in med school, I slipped into abusing meds very fast. And let me tell you something, quitting cold turkey doesn't work. It doesn't work.",
        "Gus: Great, so what's the alternative?",
        "Rick: If you need help, Gus, it's here for you.",
        "Gus: You know what, Rick, thank you for being straight with me. Okay? I appreciate it. I really do.",
        "Rick: I was expecting you to fight me on this.",
        "Gus: No. I'm being sincere. Thank you. And now it is my turn to be straight with you, okay? Yeah, I've been popping the little things like candy. And then when my girl expressed a concern, I just said, \"no.\" And then I realized in my head that it's not that easy just to say, \"no.\" I did it, but it's just as easy to say, \"yes.\" So I'm thinking how do I even talk to anybody about that.",
        "Rick: That's what you do, you talk about it to somebody.",
        "Gus: Yeah. That's what I'm doing. I appreciate it. And if I have that inclination or if I'm tempted, I'll talk to you.",
        "Rick: I appreciate it. You have to thank Harley. She deserves some credit. She told me to speak to you about this.",
        "Gus: Good.",
        "Harley: Everything okay in here?",
        "Rick: I think your patient is doing pretty good.",
        "Harley: Excellent.",
        "Rick: Yes. I actually have work to do. So, Gus, talk to me, call me if you have any questions about anything, okay?",
        "Gus: Okay.",
        "Harley: Sorry. But I'm relieved...",
        "Gus: Listen to me, I'm not a drug addict. And I don't want your sorry. I just want your trust. But I don't have that, do I?",

        "Gus: What is this? What is this? This means that we're married and that we trust each other. I'm married and I'm going to spend the rest of my life with somebody I trust.",
        "Harley: Listen. Listen. I went to Rick...",
        "Gus: You went to Rick behind my back. After all of the crap we've been through, this is what you think of me? Oh, my God.",
        "Harley: I want to help you.",
        "Gus: Well, this is not the way to do it. I've got to stand in here and listen to Mike Brady preach to me about the dangers of drugs. I don't need you or him or anybody else telling me about the dangers of drugs. I'm a cop. I'm a cop. I bust drug addicts, I'm not one of them. I proved that to you. I stopped taking them, I proved myself to you.",
        "Harley: Obviously, you're still in pain.",
        "Gus: I gave you the bottle to you. Have I taken any since?",
        "Harley: I don't know. Have you?",
        "Gus: Excuse me?",
        "Harley: These have been in my bag the whole time. I put them in the front pouch of my bag. Suddenly, they ended up on the inside of my bag. And suddenly you went from being tired in pain guy to happy and full of energy guy.",
        "Gus: I saw Zach and I was happy...",
        "Harley: Maybe what is in the pills is what made you happy. Let me ask you something, did you go through my bag and take the pills?",
        "Gus: Oh, my God. Count them, how many pills are in that thing? Count them out. How many pills...",
        "Harley: I don't want to count them.",
        "Gus: No. Just count them out. So you don't think I rummaged through your bag.",
        "Harley: Gus, I don't want to count the pills. I just worry about you, and I want you to be okay. That's it.",
        "Gus: Listen. If I need a pill, I'll take a pill and I'll tell you about it. That's what normal people do. My point is I don't need them. I just need you. I just need you, okay? Okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: You're staring.",
        "Buzz: You amaze me. Josh comes in here, practically grovels to get you to sell him Cross Creek, and you tell him to get lost. And Cassie comes in here and in about five minutes, bang, it's a done deal all because of...",
        "Olivia: Because of the beacon, and that's a great business deal. And business trumps revenge, as well as it should.",
        "Buzz: I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.",
        "Olivia: Well, it means that I can be rational. It means I can see what's good for me and not screw it up and let my passion get the good of me.",

        "Cassie: If you want it. All I ask is that you pay me what you would pay Olivia.",
        "Josh: Of course I will, I just don't understand. How did you make this happen?",
        "Cassie: I sold Olivia my share of the Beacon.",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Cassie: I wanted to do it, so don't even get started. This isn't about charity or out of guilt or anything about that. This is a win/win situation.",
        "Josh: The Beacon was your hotel, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: I know, I know. And I'm proud of what we've done here. But I wanted to be free.",
        "Josh: Wait a second, is this like a movie where the lady is in a bad relationship and she sells everything she has and moves to Italy...",
        "Cassie: Exactly. That's exactly it. I'm so distraught over not having a man around to make my life worth living that I've completely lost all capacity for rational thought. That's it. How much do you think I could get for R.J.?",
        "Josh: All right, all right, I get the point, but it still doesn't explain why.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: So, what are you going to tell Blake about this?",
        "Frank: I don't know, I haven't decided. I think it would be cruel to go to her without enough information.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, probably.",
        "Frank: I'm going to conduct an investigation to see who wanted Ross dead and why.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, there was somebody else on that plane...",
        "Frank: I know. Nikki Landers. She was his assistant. But I don't think anybody wanted her dead. I've got to go to another appointment, so, Jeffrey, do me a favor. Just keep this under your hat, okay?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, sure. Lavorch, I need you to look into something for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Josh, can I tell you something, something from my heart?",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Cassie: You have, without a doubt, the biggest, most amazing ego of anyone I have ever met.",
        "Josh: Really?",
        "Cassie: Have you not heard a word that I've said? Apparently not. Because if you think that this deal is about me making some huge, cry sacrifice for you. I am the one who gets the sweetest rewards from this. I get my freedom back.",
        "Josh: Freedom from what?",
        "Cassie: From the life I've been living ever since Richard died. I get to refocus now, I get to redefine who I am, and what's important to me. Not everybody gets that chance.",
        "Josh: That's true.",
        "Cassie: So, I'm going to put Edmund behind me once and for all, and that one over there, too. And, you know, without the Beacon taking so much of my time and energy, I can look for new projects to get involved with.",
        "Josh: And new people.",
        "Cassie: They do say life is change.",
        "Josh: You sounded like Reva just then.",
        "Cassie: I'll take that as a compliment.",
        "Josh: Cheers.",
        "Cassie: Cheers. ( Glasses clink )",
        "Josh: So, you are happy?",
        "Cassie: Are you kidding me, I am thrilled. My life is crisis-free right now at this moment. Tammy and I are speaking again and you and Reva are giving it another go. This is a good thing. This is a very, very good thing.",
        "Jeffrey: Hi, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Hi.",
        "Jeffrey: How's it going?",
        "Cassie: I'm doing great.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Okay, I'm not going to lie to myself about why I sold Cross Creek, and I'm certainly not going to lie to you. It's time to let go.",
        "Buzz: Of all of your Oklahoma holdings?",
        "Olivia: Of all of my Oklahomans. When Josh asked me to buy the place, it was easy to say no to him, because if something is going to make Reva's life better or happier, I'm against it on principle.",
        "Buzz: Oh, I noticed that.",
        "Olivia: But when Cassie started to walk away, it hit me. You know, the big reason, maybe the only reason I'm holding onto this place is because I'm also holding onto Josh.",
        "Buzz: I thought you were past that.",
        "Olivia: I thought I was, too. It's just hard for me to let go of dreams. You know, it's hard for me to get on with life, my life as it really is. You know, I had to say good-bye to that, that place and that way of thinking.",
        "Buzz: It is a hard thing to do.",
        "Olivia: Yeah. But you find new dreams.",

        "Harley: Okay, well, let's go. I'll walk you back to Company.",
        "Gus: Hey, give me a little stroller and a blanky.",
        "Harley: Hungry for a knuckle sandwich?",
        "Frank: Hey, kids, am I interrupting anything here?",
        "Harley: No, we were just leaving.",
        "Frank: Hey, sis.",
        "Harley: Hey, babe.",
        "Frank: Can I borrow your husband for a one second, please?",
        "Harley: Sure. I'll go find Rick. He'll want to say good-bye.",
        "Frank: Okay.",
        "Gus: Hi, Frank. What's up?",
        "Frank: I'm good. I'm good. How's the leg?",
        "Gus: It's good. Just like a routine physical, you know? What's happening?",
        "Frank: I want you to take a look at this.",
        "Gus: Somebody murdered Ross? Does Blake know about this?",
        "Frank: No, she doesn't, and I don't want her to know yet. I put you on the case because of your connections in DC. We need to find everything we can about Ross and find out what he was working on down there. Let me get...",
        "Gus: No, it's good. I'm fine. I'm fine. Yeah, yeah, we'll do that.",
        "Frank: You're... you know what, maybe I should put somebody else on this case.",
        "Gus: I'm fine. It's just a rush of blood to the head.",
        "Frank: Well, you don't look fine, actually.",
        "Gus: I... Rick just said my leg is cool. Look it. See, I'm good. I'm good.",
        "Frank: You know, Gus, maybe this is not a good time...",
        "Gus: Frank, please, I need to get back in the game, okay? I need it. And Ross is my friend, too. And you know me, I'll follow the evidence to the end. You know that I will, wherever it takes me. So just... what do you say?",
        "Frank: All right, Gus, I'll give you a shot at it.",
        "Gus: So, I'll take the file and I'll make some calls tonight. And we'll have breakfast or something in the morning and we'll talk... we'll get a fresh start.",
        "Frank: That sounds like a good idea.",
        "Gus: It's a great idea. These are all great... I've got nothing but great ideas, right, Chief?",
        "Frank: Just take care of that leg.",
        "Gus: Yeah, I'm good.",
        "Frank: Okay.",
        "Jeffrey: What did you get? Nikki was a licensed P.I., you sure about that? What was her last job? Yeah, well, she was working as an executive assistant when she died. It was probably a cover-up. Well, we need to find out if someone hired her to check out Marler. Okay, got to go. Hi.",
        "Blake: Relax, I didn't catch any big plans for certain victory. Not that you're going to win.",
        "Jeffrey: I would never discuss strategy with my people in a public place, just to let you know. We have closed-door sessions for that kind of thing.",
        "Blake: Silly me. You and your people, you just have a good day.",
        "Jeffrey: Blake...",
        "Blake: Don't, please. I don't need your pity. So whatever I said the other night about my feelings towards Ross and this rumored affair with Nicole Landers, just forget it. I just don't think it's a wise idea for me to open up to my opponent.",
        "Jeffrey: I'll keep that in mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Ooh, thanks. Listen, I want you to know I'm working on the Frank/Buzz situation.",
        "Buzz: Really, how?",
        "Olivia: Well, at the gala the other night, I told Frank that if it weren't for you, he and I probably wouldn't even be together.",
        "Buzz: I'm just so handy, aren't I?",
        "Olivia: I also said straight out that he had to work things out with you, okay? And he said he didn't know how. But that doesn't mean that he doesn't want to. He does. I know he does.",
        "Buzz: Listen to you. What were you, a cheerleader in high school or president of the optimists' club?",
        "Olivia: There was no football in San Cristobel. And I have a fatalistic streak a mile wide. No. Listen, I just really believe with a little work and patience you guys can work through this.",
        "Buzz: ( Laughs )",
        "Olivia: What? What is so funny?",
        "Buzz: It's not funny, it's sweet. You're so eager to make things right between me and Frank.",
        "Olivia: Well, I'm at least half the reason y they're not.",
        "Buzz: It would be a little easier for you to sit on the sidelines, than it would for me to blame you.",
        "Olivia: I would blame me. You're about you, both of you.",
        "Buzz: I know, thank you.",
        "Olivia: I should phone the Beacon. I need to make a call.",
        "Buzz: Yeah. Frank, what a surprise.",
        "Frank: Yeah, nothing like a good surprise.",
        "Buzz: Can I get you.. I've got pizza...",
        "Frank: No thank you. I'm meeting someone here.",
        "Buzz: I thought maybe, you know, we could have a little talk.",
        "Frank: Not now.",
        "Buzz: Frank, I mean, how are we going to...",
        "Frank: I've got a lot going tonight now. All the other stuff is just going to have to wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: There it is. See, I told you. The floor plan to Cross Creek drawn by heart.",
        "Cassie: Very impressive. Now, can you draw in the changes that Olivia made when she redecorated.",
        "Josh: Yeah, well, you know what, actually I didn't pay a whole lot of attention last time I was down there. Not that what she did wasn't lovely, but it just didn't... it didn't capture the soul of this place.",
        "Cassie: I see. Well, now it is your place.",
        "Josh: That's right, it is. And you know what else?",
        "Cassie: Hm?",
        "Josh: I can change it back. I can do that. It really wouldn't take that much I mean, a little bit of paint, a little bit of sparkle here and there. I could buy up some used furniture at the local shops there and restore it to the way it was back in the days of H.B. Lewis.",
        "Cassie: The pre-Olivia days.",
        "Josh: The real boys of Cross Creek.",
        "Cassie: You are really jazzed about this?",
        "Josh: You know what else? I just had another idea. I can do it before Reva gets back from her trip. This will be great. It would be like a symbol, you know, proof that we can rebuild our relationship and make it the way that it used to be. In fact, I'm going to get the jet fired up right now, I'll get Hawk to help me out. He can help me put together a crew, and... did I say something wrong here? I mean, you got very quiet all of a sudden. Did I forget to thank you for putting this ball in motion? Because I think I did.",
        "Cassie: No. You thanked me about 50 times. I'm just... I don't know, I'm just wondering when you're going to get around to your asking me to go with you. Don't underestimate my spackling ability.",
        "Josh: You want to come with me to Cross Creek?",
        "Cassie: I am out of work now, remember? And R.J. has never been to Oklahoma, he is on spring break right now.",
        "Josh: Okay, okay. Let's fix that right now. Yeah, it's Josh. Fire up the jet. Cross Creek for three.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Okay, we should wait for... what are you doing?",
        "Gus: I'm taking an aspirin, all right?",
        "Harley: For your leg?",
        "Gus: Yes. No, for my ear, what do you think? Don't tell Rick I'm still in the hospital. Plus, I'm on the lookout for one of those robes with the flap in the back because they're very comfortable.",
        "Rick: You two all set?",
        "Harley: I think so.",
        "Gus: Let's get out of here.",
        "Rick: Okay.",
        "Harley: We won't be needing these anymore, right?",
        "Rick: Right. I'll see you two up front.",
        "Gus: Thanks, man. Good to see you. Can we go?",
        "Harley: Wait. Baby, you should get a haircut. ( Laughs ) I'm sorry for not trusting you. We're okay, right?",
        "Gus: Yeah, we're good. We're good. Can we go? I can't stand hospitals.",
