(Door slams) why didn't you try to stop him?", "Danny: Hmm?", "Michelle: Are you going to tell me what this is all about?", "Danny: Bill's upset, honey.", "Michelle: Right, I figured that part out. Why?", "Danny: Because we had a little disagreement.", "Michelle: Okay. About what?", "Danny: Look, neither one of us has been in a situation like this before. It's very intense working so hard only to lose the election to ross after a recount.", "Michelle: Well, then we'll do another count, okay? And we're going to contest every ballot that doesn't go our way.", "Danny: No. That's what I'm trying to tell you-- a recount, another recount, would kill us. Honey, they already think that i rigged the vote.", "Michelle: Danny, that is exactly why we have to continue to fight to clear your name, okay? Look-- you ran an honest campaign, and the people deserve to know that.", "Danny: Well, I need you... (knocking on door)", "Ross: Hello, michelle.", "Michelle: Oh, uh... ross, this really isn't a good time.", "Danny: No, honey, it's okay. I asked ross to come over. We have some business to settle.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Danny is going to be fine. He's a survivor. He has a family who loves him. Stop worrying about danny and start focusing a bit on my distress.", "Cassie: What's wrong?", "Edmund: I am tired of all the restaurants in this town, I am hungry, and I have to eat.", "Cassie: Well, we have to take care of that.", "Edmund: Yes, we do. You know what I'm going to do?", "Cassie: No.", "Edmund: I'm going to put you in the kitchen, and you're going to satisfy every single one of my cravings.", "Cassie: You mean I don't already?", "Edmund: I love you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alexandra: Well, good. I was just about to order another.", "Alan: Well, hold on to your seats, ladies and gentlemen. So, why'd you invite me out at this hour for a late dinner when cook had prepared a lovely meal at home, huh?", "Alexandra: Because we can't talk at home. The walls have ears-- olivia's ears.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Frank: Okay. There you go, sweetheart.", "Marina: Oh, dad, you are so weird.", "Frank: Thank you, honey.", "Marina: Cute weird, making such a big deal out of us having dinner together.", "Frank: Well, it kind of is a big deal, isn't it? I mean, how many chances do we get to do this?", "Michelle: I just feel bad taking you away from darci.", "Frank: Well, don'T. It was her idea. She knew how much I was missing my little girl.", "Michelle: I'm missing you, too, dad. This is nice.", "Frank: This is more than nice, because we're going to have a very big night tonight, because we have something to celebrate.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: Okay, so I guess everyone's gone now except us.", "Tammy: I guess we're the only ones still worried about forgetting our lines.", "Joey: Tonight really helped me a lot. You get points for having us over here tonight, lizzie.", "Lizzie: Yeah, well, I need to make things up to a lot of people-- the whole world, practically.", "Tammy: Spare the world and start with olivia.", "Lizzie: You know, I'm going to start with anyone but olivia. She moved in here, did I tell you that? She's bogarting her way back into our family again.", "Joey: Speaking of family, i think every spaulding in town is going to be at the play. I picked up your tickets.", "Lizzie: Oh, except my dad still... oh, wait. You know what? I think I left the front door open. Let me go check.", "Joey: Maybe I should go check on her?", "Tammy: Whatever.", "Lizzie: You carry a handkerchief?", "Joey: My mom makes me. \"Joseph francis angelo lupo, you're going to be a gentleman even if it kills you.\" Oh. So I'm thinking you're out here crying because you miss your dad, and you're sad he won't be at the play tomorrow.", "Lizzie: How did you know that?", "Joey: I'm missing my dad, too.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marah: Do you know how much I'll miss you?", "Jeffrey: Go.", "Marah: Jeffrey...", "Jeffrey: Look, the first step's the hardest, but you have to do it, okay? Just do it. Do it for yourself. Everything's going to be okay. Everything's going to be more than okay, I promise. Now go.", "Marah: I love you.", "Jeffrey: I love you, too, marah. This portion of \"guiding light\" is sponsored by tampax-- the one, the only, tampax.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: Ross, please have a seat. I'll be with you in just one minute. Okay, look. I wanted to tell you about this before ross came over.", "Michelle: Well, it's too late. He's here. So tell me what?", "Danny: Well...", "Ross: Danny, it's all right, you know? I can come back later.", "Danny: No. No. Okay, you wanted to know what bill and I were arguing about. Ross, it was a fierce campaign with great ideas on both sides. Now, I'm not saying the better man won, but I've... you know I've always respected you. I know that you will make a fine mayor. I'm conceding. Congratulations.", "Michelle: Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.", "Danny: Honey...", "Michelle: No, no, no. Absolutely not.", "Danny: No, the recount was fair. It was close. It was close, but ross won it. It was fair. Congratulations.", "Ross: Danny, this was not what I expected when you called.", "Danny: I'm sure it was a big relief, huh?", "Ross: Not really, because I'm sorry that it's ending this way. You and I both got into this race for all the right reasons.", "Michelle: No, ross. You entered this race to push danny out.", "Danny: Michelle, stop it.", "Ross: It's all right. It's all right. I'm sure blake would fight the same fight if the circumstances were reversed. Danny, I accept your concession. You let me know how you want it to be announced. And believe me, I'm going to do my very best for this city.", "Danny: I know you will. I do.", "Ross: Michelle. All right, we'll be in touch. Both of you take care.", "Danny: You, too. Michelle, it's not ross' fault.", "Michelle: Danny, right now i hate everyone who doubted you-- everyone.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ed: Hey, ross, what's going on?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ross: Danny just conceded the election to me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: Danny, don't do this. Please look-- this is a decision that you're going to regret.", "Danny: Okay, I know that you don't want to give up. I do.", "Michelle: Well, you shouldn't want to, either. No, look. Look, you should be calling right now for a recount.", "Danny: Why? The votes are just going to come back the same way. Ross has the votes.", "Michelle: You don't know that. People make mistakes on their ballots all the time.", "Danny: Trust me, trust me. Trust me, I know.", "Michelle: How do you know?", "Danny: I know.", "Michelle: You have never cared about what people say about you. You've fought much harder battles than this one, danny.", "Danny: Well, those were fights I knew I could win, honey.", "Michelle: Well, you wouldn't have run if you didn't think you could win. You know what?", "Danny: What?", "Michelle: You don't look like someone who's lost something. You look like you've given up. And that is not like you, danny. So what is really going on?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alexandra: Well, alan, it's a crying shame we have to leave our own home in order to have a private conversation, isn't it?", "Alan: May I remind you that bringing olivia into our home was a part of your master scheme?", "Alexandra: Yes, yes, and yes. And I stand by the plan, too. It doesn't mean I have to enjoy it. It's going to be a very difficult time, a difficult period of adjustment.", "Alan: Yes, it will be difficult, but we will do the best we can.", "Alexandra: Yes, of course, we will. And you know something? It is lovely having a new baby in the house again, isn't it? Because she's a doll.", "Alan: Although one would never know it. Olivia won't let us anywhere near emma.", "Alexandra: Well, I swear the nanny is an ex-marine or something.", "Alan: Either that or a bodyguard. Now, alexandra, you didn't invite me all the way down here just to discuss olivia.", "Alexandra: No, absolutely not. Because in the big scheme of things olivia's just a fly on the wall we can just, you know, splat when the time is right. No, I want to talk about something that's far more important-- spaulding. Spaulding's image. We happen to be on a disastrous track right now if we don't do something about it, and I mean now.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: Hi, mom.", "Cassie: Hi, honey. How's rehearsal?", "Tammy: We're done. Can you come pick me up?", "Cassie: I thought lizzie was sending you home in a car.", "Tammy: Her driver's out right now, and I really want to come home.", "Edmund: Does tammy need a ride? Tell her I'm on my way.", "Cassie: Did you hear that? Your knight in shining armor is on his way.", "Tammy: Oh, that is so great. Thanks, mom. And thank edmund for me.", "Cassie: I will. You know what?", "Edmund: Hmm?", "Cassie: You're my knight in shining armor, too.", "Edmund: Mmm. Mmm. Hmm.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: So my dad's in a psychiatric hospital.", "Joey: That's pretty tough.", "Lizzie: If only you knew what it felt like to have your dad just disappear in this dark hole and then miss these huge chunks of your life.", "Joey: At least your parents are still around. It's just been me and my mom for a while now.", "Lizzie: You miss your dad?", "Joey: Sometimes. You know, it screwed with my head for a while. I thought it was my fault my parents were apart.", "Lizzie: You know what? I feel the same way, too. And those feelings, they just make you do stuff.", "Joey: I did stuff.", "Lizzie: Yeah, me, too.", "Joey: And I stopped messing around when I saw how sad I was making my mom. Plus father ray got on my back. Look, lizzie, I'm not telling you any of this stuff so you're going to feel sorry for me. I just want to let you know i get it. I get you. You know, the things with your dad, the stuff you did.", "Lizzie: Why I kidnapped my baby sister?", "Joey: You didn't hurt her, right?", "Lizzie: No, never.", "Joey: Okay, so things went down the way they went down, same with me.", "Lizzie: Yeah, but you have a reputation.", "Joey: So do you.", "Lizzie: Why are you being so nice to me?", "Joey: Give me one good reason why I shouldn't be. I mean, I like you. We're friends.", "Lizzie: Since when?", "Joey: Since you decided that you could be a friend to me. It took you long enough, though.", "Lizzie: Yeah. I guess everyone just thinks I'm a pain in the butt.", "Joey: Yeah.", "Lizzie: Okay. You're supposed to say, \"no, you're not.\"", "Joey: You are. I still like you, though.", "Lizzie: All right. That's cool.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marah: Hi.", "Jeffrey: Hi.", "Marah: I'm not supposed to be here.", "Jeffrey: No, you're not. I didn't want you to leave. I... you had to. It was best for you.", "Marah: What's best for me is you. You know you'll never be whole again without me.", "Jeffrey: No, I won'T.", "Marah: Then don't ever let me go.", "Jeffrey: Hi. What are you doing? What, do you think I'm sad? Well, I'm not. I'm not sad, okay? What, you don't believe me? I bet you your fire truck. I'm not sad. I bet you your fire truck and a bag of marbles I'M... what am I doing? I'm lying to you. You know, I shouldn't be lying to you, you know? We've got a great friendship, right? And that's not going to go anywhere unless we're completely honest with each other, so you pegged me. You're a smart kid, okay? I'm sad. I am. You know, I could smile. I could smile and I could... i could smile so big my face would crack, but people would still know I'm sad. At least you would. So I should be honest with you. I'm sad, I admit it. But you know what? I'm not going to do anything except wallow in my sadness and go to work.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rj: You always work.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: Well, maybe that's because, you know, it helps me to not think about things that i don't want to think about. You know, isn't someone looking for you? Well, here's your mommy, so why don't you get going?", "Cassie: Hey. Mrs. Chitwood's ready to take you to your sleep-over, okay? Yeah.", "Jeffrey: You got a sweet kid there, mrs. Winslow, but i thought... I thought I told you to keep him out of here.", "Cassie: Looks like to me you enjoy the company.", "Jeffrey: Well, I was just trying to be polite to the kid, you know?", "Cassie: Polite? I think the word you used was \"sad.\"", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ed: You know, when danny brought me back to town, i thought I was finally going to become the father my kids needed, but since I've been back, I have... I've caused more problems than I've solved.", "Ross: Both michelle and rick love having you here. For themselves, of course, but now there's also the grandchildren.", "Ed: And then obviously I love the grandchildren, but now all i sit... I sit around and worry, you know? Am I going to let them down, too?", "Ross: You won'T.", "Ed: I've got to go inside.", "Ross: Yeah? I think danny and michelle need a little parenting at this point, and frankly, I feel sorry for danny, because I remember being his age and doing the wrong thing for the right reasons. And he so wanted this to work out.", "Ed: Yeah, I know.", "Ross: Give me a call when you're done. I'll be up... better yet, why don't you come over? Blake is just dying to see you.", "Ed: Okay. Congratulations, mr. Mayor.", "Ross: Thank you, edward.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: Nothing is going on. Nothing is going on. I'm conceding to ross because i lost.", "Michelle: No. No, danny.", "Danny: Yeah, michelle. The recount was fair. Dragging it out will just make me look like a bigger loser.", "Michelle: Okay, you've included me in everything. Now, here is the biggest decision for you to make...", "Danny: You are all I'm thinking about, you and the family.", "Michelle: But we're fine.", "Danny: No.", "Michelle: Okay, we want you to keep on fighting.", "Danny: No, no, no. Look, if I sue for another recount, I will be dragging my name in the mud and the bauer name right along with it.", "Michelle: If you give up and walk away, people are going to think you did rig the vote.", "Danny: Ross is a good man. Ross will be a good mayor. That's it, discussion over.", "Michelle: I can't let this go, danny.", "Danny: Michelle, I don't want to talk about it anymore! (Knock at door) come in. Hey, ed.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ed: It's a bad time.", "Danny: No, actually, it's not. Please, come in.", "Ed: I ran into ross on the way in.", "Michelle: You know what? If you're here to tell us how everything worked out for the best...", "Danny: Michelle.", "Michelle: Just don't, okay?", "Danny: She'S... she's having a harder time of it than I am.", "Ed: That's what ross said.", "Danny: Yeah. I'm so lucky I have a wife that wants to fight for me.", "Ed: Yeah, you are. Look, danny, I'm sorry. I know that I jumped on the bandwagon real late, but I have a lot of faith in you, and i think you would have made a fine mayor.", "Danny: Thanks, ed. I appreciate it.", "Ed: I mean, I know how hard you fight for stuff when you think it's right. I mean, how hard you fought to bring me back to my family.", "Danny: Still one of the best things I've ever done.", "Ed: Well, I'll tell you what: I think I ought to go.", "Michelle: You know what? Don't go because of me, please.", "Ed: Honey, I don't want to intrude.", "Michelle: Hey, that's what parents do, right? I mean, I plan on intruding on robbie the rest of his life, so... you know, if I'm weird right now, it's just because i am. I'm just... I'm still spinning.", "Ed: I understand.", "Michelle: I was really awful to ross before.", "Ed: Don't you think that blake would have fought the same kind of fight as you?", "Michelle: Yeah, I know. I know. I'm just really sorry that we made you choose between us and ross. I know that that's been really hard on you guys.", "Ed: Honey, ross knows that i will always be on your side. And yours, too.", "Danny: Thanks.", "Michelle: Yeah, thank you. I guess maybe there's one good thing that came out of all this mess.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alexandra: And, alan, I don't have to remind you of the beating that spaulding image has taken in the last few months. First, there's phillip's breakdown. Then there's the deal you made to save your own hide, to allow the feds to investigate us.", "Alan: The feds were going to investigate us anyway. I was thinking about the company when I made the deal in the first place, alexandra.", "Alexandra: Yes, you keep telling yourself that.", "Alan: You know, it's interesting that you never mention last year's big scandal, where you tried to drug me into oblivion.", "Alexandra: All right, alan, you and I agreed we would move past that, and I'm talking here and now, in the present. The latest disaster we have concerns bad girl. I was just informed that our spokeswoman for bad girl is going to marry happily and become a good girl. What next?", "Alan: I don't know, but I'm sure you're going to tell me, so why don't you go ahead and make your pitch. What is it? Are we going to open an animal shelter in the lobby? Save the rain forest? Save the whales? What? Tell me.", "Alexandra: I don't know. I just know that we have to do something.", "Alan: Well, that's brilliant. Thank you so much. This has been extremely helpful. Now, if you will excuse me...", "Alexandra: No, no, wait a minute. Whoa, hold on. Here he is. This is the young man who might possibly help us save spaulding's image.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Frank: You know what I was thinking about the other day? I was thinking about all those old father-daughter dances that I used to take you to at your elementary school, you know, before your mother moved you away.", "Marina: You know, I cried the first time I realized we couldn't go to that dance together.", "Frank: Well, you know what? Maybe we can make up for that.", "Marina: (Laughs) what, you want to go to a father-daughter dance?", "Frank: Well, I mean not necessarily a father-daughter dance, but maybe some special event that comes about. Speaking of which, doesn't my little girl have a birthday coming up?", "Marina: That's right. How many shopping days are left?", "Frank: Don't worry, I already have your gift. Don'T... don't worry, darci helped me pick out everything.", "Marina: Everything?", "Frank: We were talking, and we thought that that museum must hold some pretty bad memories for you. I mean, that whole thing that went down with ben and that crazy nut-case carrie.", "Marina: You bought me my own apartment?", "Frank: Better than that. We redid your old room at the house. It is ready and waiting for you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: You know, I never really thought that we had anything in common. I mean, look at us.", "Joey: Yeah. You're like miss richie rich, and I'm, like, not. (Laughs)", "Lizzie: Yeah. I'm sure if I was a guy, I'd be something like you. Except I'd have my money, of course.", "Joey: I'll take your money.", "Lizzie: Yeah. And I would be this big-time baseball stud with a super popular girlfriend.", "Joey: Who's always comparing me to someone else.", "Lizzie: She's comparing you to who?", "Joey: Forget it.", "Lizzie: No, seriously, joey. Do you think she likes someone else?", "Joey: No, not \"likes,\" exactly. She's just... she puts her mom's boyfriend on such a high pedestal he probably has a nosebleed by now.", "Lizzie: Edmund?", "Joey: I mean, you should see the way she looks at him and the way she hangs on his every word, like he's a movie star or something. I can't compete against that.", "Lizzie: Well, you shouldn't have to, joey. Ew. She has a crush on edmund?", "Joey: No. Look, tammy's with me and everything's cool except for this one thing, okay? So forget it. And don't say anything?", "Lizzie: Okay, I won'T.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: There you guys are. Edmund's on his way over. Maybe he can help us work on act I, especially your balcony stuff. It still needs work.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: She so does not deserve him.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: I know what you did for marah.", "Jeffrey: Well, you know what?", "Cassie: It must have been tough.", "Jeffrey: Marah's not here. Marah's gone. Marah left.", "Cassie: I know that.", "Jeffrey: And I really don't feel like discussing it, if you don't mind.", "Cassie: I'm sure you don't, but...", "Jeffrey: But you're not done, are you?", "Cassie: No, not quite. I think what you did for marah was amazing, and I may have been wrong about you.", "Jeffrey: No, you weren't wrong about me, okay? I am a big jerk. Side of things sometimes. And thank you for the compliment, but if the compliments are done, I really do have to get to work. Okay?", "Cassie: Sorry that I made you feel a human connection. But since you mention work, danny santos is a very good friend of mine, and your office is investigating him. Now, maybe you can't tell me anything, but I would like to know if the allegations against him are true.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Joey: Okay, let's do the balcony scene. That's the one thing everyone's going to be waiting for.", "Tammy: You're supposed to be on my right?", "Joey: I'm more comfortable over here.", "Tammy: But that's not the way sandy blocked it.", "Joey: But this works for me. Sandy won't care.", "Lizzie: Yeah, it works for me, too.", "Tammy: You can't just change everything at the last minute.", "Joey: Why not, if it makes things better?", "Tammy: Because... edmund! I am so glad you're here. Joey keeps trying to change everything. We're going to look like a bunch of amateurs.", "Edmund: Whatever happens, you are going to be the loveliest juliet springfield has ever seen.", "Tammy: You really think so?", "Edmund: I'm sure of it.", "Tammy: Lizzie, thanks for letting us use your house. I'll see you guys tomorrow.", "Joey: Whoa, whoa. You're not quitting are you?", "Tammy: Edmund came to take me home.", "Joey: Right. But it's not like you don't have another ride home. This is the last night we're all going to all get to rehearse the play together.", "Tammy: Didn't we just say if you're not ready by now, you'll never be ready.", "Joey: I'm ready. I could be readier.", "Tammy: We'll be fine. I don't want to keep edmund waiting.", "Edmund: We can stay. I can help you.", "Lizzie: You know what? You should get juliet to bed. She needs to get her beauty rest. And I can help joey.", "Tammy: Thank you, lizzie.", "Lizzie: Yeah.", "Tammy: You ready?", "Edmund: Your carriage awaits.", "Tammy: See you tomorrow.", "Edmund: Good night.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: Are you okay?", "Joey: Yeah, I guess... i don't know. We were supposed to hang tonight. I guess I'll just go home.", "Lizzie: Well, no. Why don't you just stay here and... I don't know, you're still nervous about it, aren't you?", "Joey: Well, I have some work I need to do, but I'll just do it at home.", "Lizzie: Well, why don't you just do it with me?", "Joey: Really? I mean, I'm not stupid, you know? I know my lines.", "Lizzie: Have a seat. I'll show you how juliet's really supposed to be done.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alexandra: Go ahead, sandy. Don't be shy.", "Sandy: No problem. What are we discussing?", "Alan: Well, apparently, you and my sister think that spaulding is in need of good pr.", "Sandy: Ah. Ah. No offense, sir. I was making a statement about big corporations in general.", "Alan: Mm-hmm.", "Sandy: You all seem to be getting a bad reputation these days.", "Alexandra: Yes, well, this conversation all started, you know, when we were discussing lizzie and what would be best to plan for her after her graduation.", "Alan: Well, I think that's simple: Diamond earrings and a trip to europe.", "Alexandra: (Laughs) I'm telling you, alan, that i think we have to come up with something, well, challenging for lizzie, and at the same time, very probably prop up spaulding's image.", "Alan: Well, I'm all for this, and I would like to hear what you both have to say. And when you come up with a plan, let me know.", "Sandy: I have a suggestion.", "Alexandra: Go ahead, go ahead.", "Sandy: Why don't you ask lizzie for her input? She's full of ideas. Put them to good use.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Frank: Marina, moving back home doesn't mean that you have to change your life altogether. I just want you to come home and rest and start breathing again. Be young again.", "Marina: Dad? Dad? That would change my life altogether. I mean, what about shayne?", "Frank: Well, he would get liberal visitation rights. I mean... it's not that I want you to be a little girl forever, okay? It's just that I know my daughter's had a lot of pressure on her, a lot of weight on her shoulders, okay, and I just want to alleviate some of the burden, some of the weight? Okay? You deserve to relax and be happy. And I just want you to start breathing again, you know?", "Sandy: She's working on the breathing. She'll get there.", "Frank: Well, if it isn't diamond jim brady.", "Sandy: That's me. Hey there, chief cooper. Mind if I...", "Marina: Don't worry, dad. I saved the family name. I beat him.", "Frank: (Laughs) I'm sure you did. Please, sit down.", "Sandy: Thank you.", "Frank: Well, honey. Did you happen to fill him in?", "Marina: About aunt harley? You bet.", "Sandy: Ah, she's my next challenge. Let it be known, I plan to beat every one of you coopers at poker. Sorry if I interrupted your dinner. I was just dropping off cassie's deposit for the after-party and ms. Spaulding stopped me.", "Marina: You and alex? I'm going to have to tell my grandfather.", "Sandy: We're working on a project for lizzie.", "Marina: Wish you luck. Lizzie's a project all unto herself.", "Sandy: Maybe, but I've taken an interest in her since I've been directing her in \"romeo and juliet.\" She needs guidance.", "Marina: Among other things.", "Frank: Well, sandy, I think that's awfully nice of you to help her out and all that. In fact, I was just having a little conversation here with my daughter, that I don't think it's such a bad idea to have somebody look out for you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ed: I love you, honey.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: I love you, too. Thank you for being here.", "Danny: It was nice of him to come by. You feel better? Make you feel better?", "Michelle: You know what? I'm never going to feel better until I get some real answers.", "Danny: Hey, you have all the answers.", "Michelle: Yeah, well, I don't believe them.", "Danny: You do. Well, that's because you're my wife, and you don't want to think anything bad about me.", "Michelle: Don'T. Don't make me seem like I'm some pathetic \"stand by your man\" wife. I know. I know that there's something wrong.", "Danny: What?", "Michelle: And danny, i can'T... I can't let it go. And I don't believe you can, either.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: So, you want to know if danny santos bought the election.", "Cassie: It's rumors, right? I mean, it's gossip. You could at least tell me whether I should listen to gossip or not.", "Jeffrey: Well, why don't you do this? Here's an idea, hm? Why don't you ignore the rumors and the gossip and believe your friend? Ah, can't do it, can you? See, that silence there should tell you something about how you see danny. You believe that he is guilty. I've got nothing else to say about it.", "Cassie: You can tell me the truth.", "Jeffrey: I'll tell you this: Think about your life, think about your kids, okay? Think about your business. And stay away from danny santos, because if you don't, you're going to find yourself in something that gets very, very ugly, and the life that you know will never be the same again.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Joey: Man, I wish I rehearsed with you more before tonight. You'd make a great juliet.", "Lizzie: (Laughs) well, tonight was the best I've ever seen you do romeo. Seriously, you had every single line down pat.", "Joey: Want to know my secret? Music. I put the words to music.", "Lizzie: Wow. That's weird. It's kind of cool.", "Joey: Music's my life. I mean, I don't know, I love it. Even more than baseball, and well, shakespeare's words are like lyrics anyway, so I just sing them in my head. It's the only way I could memorize this stuff.", "Lizzie: So you just sing your entire performance?", "Joey: Yeah.", "Lizzie: Wow, that's amazing.", "Joey: I've got another secret.", "Lizzie: Okay. Well, you can tell me.", "Joey: I'm going to sing to tammy tomorrow at the cast party. I've got it all planned out.", "Lizzie: You're going to sing, like, a love song to her? You're going to serenade her?", "Joey: Yeah.", "Lizzie: Wow, joey.", "Joey: Don't say anything, okay? I'm afraid I'm going to punk out. I'm nervous as it is.", "Lizzie: No, no, no, it'll be great. I mean, you're singing a love song to your girlfriend. I can't think anything else would be more romantic.", "Joey: Lizzie, thanks.", "Lizzie: No, honestly, you helped me out so much. I feel so much better. I really do.", "Joey: No problem. Anytime.", "Lizzie: Anytime.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: You know what? I think we both need some sleep. You need some rest.", "Michelle: Yeah, okay. I'll rest when this thing is over.", "Danny: Honey, it's over.", "Michelle: So you're just going to sit back and let them do this to you?", "Danny: It's done.", "Michelle: No, danny.", "Danny: Yeah, it is.", "Michelle: No, it's not.", "Danny: It is.", "Michelle: I'm going upstairs and I'm going to check on our son.", "Danny: Okay. I'll be up in a minute. Yeah, I conceded to ross. I'll make it public tomorrow.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: Okay, good. Anything else?", "Danny: Uh, let's see. Bill, my campaign manager and former friend, wanted to beat the hell out of me.", "Jeffrey: Well, you should've let him. That kind of thing would have worked for us.", "Danny: Well, fortunately, bill is a decent guy, so I got to keep my teeth.", "Jeffrey: Well, good for you. Anything else?", "Danny: Yeah. I hope your night was worse than mine.", "Jeffrey: That's funny. Hang on a second.", "Danny: What?", "Jeffrey: Well, it's time for the next step now. Your public confession.", "Danny: How much more do you want from me, o'neill?", "Jeffrey: You're going to have to pace yourself, danny. This is just the beginning. You better go work on that speech. Marah. They say a man can be happy with any woman as long as he doesn't love her. Well, that's a lie. Because I loved you and you made me happier, happier than I ever had a right to be. Good-bye.", "Danny: Next, on \"guiding light\"...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: I don't know why you're trying to destroy my husband, but I do know that you are going to have to go through me to do it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: There's no way to prove I didn't do it, tony.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tony: Well, you know what? There's one way to fix this mess, danny. You tell them I did it."], "Transcript Author": ["by Boo"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WMANmpQqOw"}
