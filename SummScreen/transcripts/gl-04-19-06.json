        "A surprise birthday party is thrown for Coop and although the family thinks that one of the other's planned it for him, it turns out that it was Lizzie. Coop and Ava are upset at first, but Lizzie claims that she planned it while they were still together. Lizzie looks at it as her last chance to get Coop back. She locks Ava away after telling her about she and Coop sleeping together and tries to get back with Coop. He reminds her that things are done but she convinces him to have one last dance with her. Ava escapes and pushes Lizzie's face into the birthday cake. Lizzie calls her mom to complain and when she mentions her recent nausea at the thought of Coop and Ava, Beth says not to mention that word because of her morning sickness. It dawns on Lizzie that she may be pregnant and she takes a test just as Alan shows up to tell her that he is going to sue the Coopers for the way that they treated her. She convinces him to leave before he finds the test. Once he leaves though Buzz shows up to try and convince Lizzie that he knows that there is still a good person inside of her and then Coop shows up and takes her to the cemetery to her Dad's grave. He tells her that at the party she acted just like Phillip and could have hurt Ava to get what she wanted and tells her that she needs to move on. She finds out that she is pregnant and although is very upset about it at first, a talk with Lillian helps her to see that children can be a positive thing in their parent's lives. She goes to the cemetery to talk with her father and tells him that she wishes he were there because although he wouldn't be happy with her she knows he would be behind her."

        "Lizzie: Am I getting fat? Oh, my gosh, tell me that I'm not. I need to look perfect for Coop tonight. Being away from him is actually ruining my complexion. God, I'm tired all the time. I can't eat. This is the last chance I have to make Coop love me again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Gee, Tammy, are there going to be clowns? Can you remind me again why I'm here?",
        "Tammy: Because you're with me, and Coop's your friend.",
        "Jonathan: No, Coop is your friend. He just likes to throw punches at me. Okay, okay, no fighting with the birthday boy, I promise.",
        "Tammy: Thank you. What dress should I wear",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: What dress should I wear tonight? This is definitely the one. Tonight Ava is going down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Hi, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: Hey, Ava. The place looks great.",
        "Ava: Yeah, it does, doesn't it?",
        "Jonathan: How do I look?",
        "Ava: Bigger question: Why are you here?",
        "Jonathan: I came to drop my girlfriend off at a party. If it's a problem, I can leave.",
        "Tammy: I believe in second chances, Ava.",
        "Ava: I'm a big believer in not screwing things up the first time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Oh, here, let me help.",
        "Frank: I got it, thank you.",
        "Buzz: Well, you got carried away there, didn't you?",
        "Frank: Yeah, you would know all about that, wouldn't you?",
        "Buzz: Oh, Frank, come on, look, I'll do anything to make this right between us. You know, I... I won't talk to Olivia, when she comes in a room I'll leave. I won't even look at her if it'll make things...",
        "Frank: This is not the place for this. This is Coop's day. Oh, great. What's this?",
        "Buzz: Blow.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, Frank, blow! ( Laughs )",
        "Ava: Just do it for Buzz. It was so cool of him to throw this party for Coop.",
        "Buzz: I wish I could take credit for this. But I think it's Harley and Frank's doing.",
        "Frank: Actually, it's not. Ava, I thought this was something you did for Coop.",
        "Ava: Oh, well, how would I pay for something like this?",
        "Tammy: Maybe Coop's throwing the party for himself. The invitation said it was a surprise party.",
        "Jonathan: Everybody looks surprised. ( All ) Surprise!",
        "Coop: Hi. What's going on?",
        "Lizzie: Surprise, surprise, surprise. Happy birthday, Coop! Okay, let's try this again. On the count of three. One, two...",
        "Buzz: Lizzie, Lizzie. You planned this?",
        "Lizzie: You do not have to thank me. It was all my pleasure. I did it all for Coop. Tell me you were surprised.",
        "Coop: Uh, yeah, I was. Look, can we talk for a second? Lizzie, you and I are not together, right? This is... is just too much, okay?",
        "Lizzie: Ooh, did you see my dress? Do you like it? Tell me you've never seen it before? It's my party and I'll cry if I want to cry if I want to...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: This is desperate even for Lizzie. I wonder what's gotten into her?",
        "Jonathan: Forget Lizzie. Let's go get a drink, okay? A little too tense in here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I paid for this party ages ago, when Coop and I were still together.",
        "Ava: Hmm. Wow, really?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, that's what I just said.",
        "Ava: Well, why did the invitations arrive so late?",
        "Lizzie: Well, I was going to cancel, and then I found out that they were going to keep my deposit, which was like, I don't know how to put this, Ava, like six months in tips. Okay, so I figured why waste the money when we could use it to celebrate Coop.",
        "Buzz: I'll get you a drink.",
        "Lizzie: Look, Coop, I know that we're not together anymore. But I just wanted to do something nice for you, to show you that I do still care.",
        "Coop: I know, but you've already gotten me a gift, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, if it's too weird, I'll just go. Happy birthday anyway.",
        "Coop: Wait, look, you went to a lot of trouble...",
        "Lizzie: For you. So just enjoy it.",
        "Coop: Come on, no, Lizzie, please, stay, okay?",
        "Lizzie: Only if you really want me to. ...Nobody knows where my Johnny has gone...",
        "Coop: Yeah, I'm sure.",
        "Lizzie: Great. ( Laughs ) Does everybody have a cocktail? Open bar, Coopers. ...He's supposed to be mine it's my party and I'll cry if I want to cry if I want to...",
        "Coop: Ava, you are sitting next to me.",
        "Ava: Coop, you are so naive.",
        "Coop: Come here. Come on. Ava, look, I know exactly what is going on here. I'm not dating Lizzie. I'm here with you tonight, all right? And right now I want nothing more than to be able to give you a kiss.",
        "Ava: Hmm, well, you are the birthday boy, and the birthday boy can have whatever he wants.",
        "Coop: Mm-mm.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, listen up, everybody. We have a great surprise tonight. I have ordered everything that Coop loves-- tacos, burritos, taquitos-- so just eat up, enjoy. I am going to go check with the cook. ( Laughs )",
        "Ava: Hang on a second, I'll help you with that. I speak restaurant.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, that's right. Thank you, Ava.",
        "Buzz: Oh, boy.",
        "Ava: This isn't working.",
        "Lizzie: No, no, no. It will. We're going to start with the nachos...",
        "Ava: You know exactly what I'm talking about, okay? You're in denial about Coop.",
        "Lizzie: ( Laughs ) And you're in denial about this dress. Where did you get it, the tall girl's discount rack?",
        "Ava: Do you think that Coop cares about designer dresses or handbags or fancy parties? You know him better than that.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I do. And I know that Coop deserves someone far better than a waitress who does her own nails. Not very well, by the way.",
        "Ava: Stop beating your head against a wall, okay? It's over between the two of you. Why don't you just let him be happy?",
        "Lizzie: Happy with you?",
        "Ava: Who knows, maybe. We'll see.",
        "Waiter: Nachos?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, no. Oh, get them away from me. I feel sick.",
        "Ava: Oh, please. Save it for an audience who cares.",
        "Lizzie: I'm not faking it.",
        "Ava: Whatever.",
        "Lizzie: I also wasn't faking it the other night when Coop and I slept together. It was great. He stayed all night.",
        "Ava: You are such a liar.",
        "Lizzie: You wish. Go ask him. We both had a night that we will never forget.",
        "Ava: Coop and I weren't even seeing each other then. And if he wanted to do that, then that was his business.",
        "Lizzie: Really? So, you don't want to hear about the details. Because I could give you a couple.",
        "Coop: Is everything okay over here?",
        "Lizzie: Yes.",
        "Coop: How are we doing?",
        "Lizzie: Everything is great. Ava and I were just having a great discussion about honesty; about whether it is better to know things or not know things. You know, just something like that. ( Chuckles )",
        "Coop: Uh-huh. I'll tell you what, why don't we get some fresh air. Okay? Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Maybe we should drag Lizzie out of here, save her from herself before she does something crazy.",
        "Jonathan: Just stay out of it.",
        "Tammy: I can't. You don't know her. When she wants something...",
        "Jonathan: Forget about Lizzie.",
        "Tammy: It's kind of hard to do.",
        "Jonathan: Well, it would be a real shame if we let Lizzie wreck our night.",
        "Tammy: Nothing Lizzie could say or do could wreck our not. We are unwreckable.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: She is so desperate. Coop?",
        "Coop: Ava, I'm sorry. When I told you that... first of all, I wasn't lying when I told you that Lizzie and I had broken up. Right? I thought we did. But sometimes you can't turn off feelings for someone, all right? And she had a rough day. She was really feeling bad that night, and she said that the Joey guy was still going after her, and so I went over there just to make sure that she was all right. And... and it just happened.",
        "Ava: Okay. So, is it just going to happen again?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: Shh, I'm busy.",
        "Tammy: Spying is not going to get you Coop back, neither is this party.",
        "Lizzie: You know, I thought you would be more positive, especially since you and Jonathan are back together.",
        "Tammy: I know you want to find love, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Love? Oh, you know about love? You know, if whatever you and your cousin have is really that great, then he would have never...",
        "Tammy: Never what?",
        "Lizzie: I better go check on the cake. It's a new flavor. You're adventurous. You like to try new things, right?",
        "Tammy: What was that all about?",
        "Jonathan: The chick is psycho. Just steer clear of her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Hey, what's the emergency?",
        "Frank: Hey, little girl.",
        "Lizzie: No emergency. I just didn't want you to miss Coop's birthday party.",
        "Marina: Coop's.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, don't freak out, we haven't done the birthday cake yet.",
        "Marina: I'm sorry, but I thought... didn't Coop break up with her?",
        "Frank: About three or four times.",
        "Marina: Where is he?",
        "Frank: He is out on the terrace looking for an escape route.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: You know what, Coop, it doesn't matter. We weren't even together then and we're not really together now. If you wanted to sleep with Lizzie, you slept with Lizzie, and, whatever, it's no big deal.",
        "Magician: Henry Cooper Bradshaw?",
        "Coop: Yeah?",
        "Magician: Happy birthday, Henry. It looks like you could use a hanky.",
        "Coop: Uh, Lizzie got me a magician. What am I, ten?",
        "Lizzie: Look, everybody, it's a magician!",
        "Magician: All right, kids. I need a volunteer from the audience who isn't afraid of swords.",
        "Jonathan: Use it on the little one in the red dress. It's her birthday. Out of order? Let's use the stairs.",
        "Tammy: It's okay. Come on, I like magic. It's such a magical evening, isn't it?",
        "Frank: This is the strangest Spaulding event I've ever been to.",
        "Marina: Yeah, I've been to some weird ones, but this one is quickly climbing the charts.",
        "Lizzie: Come here, I have to show you something. Come on.",
        "Ava: Where are we going?",
        "Lizzie: I have to show you something. It's going to be the most amazing magic trick of the night. Abracadabra. Now you see her, now you don't.",
        "Ava: ( Laughs ) Funny Lizzie, very funny. Lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: Poof, she's gone. Good riddance.",
        "Ava: Lizzie! ( Cheers and applause )",
        "Lizzie: Come on, everybody, let's dance.",
        "Ava: Is anybody there? Lizzie, let me out!",
        "Lizzie: Tell me, were you really surprised?",
        "Coop: Yeah, I was surprised. Look, come here. Come here. Why would you tell Ava about that night? Whatever we did or did not do was supposed to be private, or at least I thought it was, right?",
        "Lizzie: Okay, so she knows that we were sleeping together. Who cares? Isn't it better to just have everything out in the open? Look, I got a new pair of shoes. Look how cute they are.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, stop, all right? You can't go around buying me gifts, you can't go around throwing me parties. We are not together, all right? It is over.",
        "Lizzie: How can that be?",
        "Coop: Lizzie, we don't belong together. All right, we tried. It was a lot more work than it supposed to be. We just need to meet other people.",
        "Lizzie: That is so easy to say. You were my first. You were my first everything. I thought you...",
        "Coop: I did, all right? I do love you, Lizzie, but just not the way you want me to.",
        "Lizzie: I know, I know. Okay? You keep saying that. I just wanted to do something nice for you before we ended it officially.",
        "Coop: ( Sighs ) Thank you, really. But you just need to stop. Enough. All right? Now, look, have you seen Ava anywhere?",
        "Lizzie: Maybe she is in the ladies' room.",
        "Coop: Maybe. My guess is she probably left.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Oh. Hello! Hello, can you hear me? Hello! Lizzie! Damn you!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: That's our song.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, no...",
        "Lizzie: Oh, come on, just one dance. One dance and then I will back off.",
        "Coop: Okay. All right. Discretely to the point of...",
        "Lizzie: I love the way you smell. No, wait, I like the way Roxy smells, too. ...A secret only a stranger...",
        "Lizzie: Come here. And my dad, too. I used to love the smell of his cologne. I have a bottle of it I keep on my dresser, and I just smell it sometimes. It's so comforting.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: ( Sighs ) I'm boiling in my own skin. ( Banging on the door )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: You really did go all out for me for this party, even if the timing was a little wrong. Thank you.",
        "Lizzie: You're welcome.",
        "Coop: Look, after the cake, I, um, think I should probably get home.",
        "Lizzie: Whatever you've got to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Lizzie!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: We did have some good times, though, right? It wasn't all bad.",
        "Coop: No. It wasn't all bad.",
        "Lizzie: It's really weird. Being this close to you, it's making me dizzy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Lizzie, why are you doing this to me, you little troll!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Oh, there you go, Coop. All right, Coop.",
        "Lizzie: The birthday boy makes the first cut.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "( Banging on door )",
        "Ava: Come on, come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I can't say enough good things about the guest of honor. He... he changed my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "( Banging on door )",
        "Ava: Open.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Make a wish. ( Blowing sounds ) ( blowing sounds )",
        "Frank: What was that?",
        "Ava: Uh!",
        "Coop: Ava, what happened?",
        "Ava: Lizzie...",
        "Lizzie: Oh, don't even try.",
        "Ava: ...Tell him what you did.",
        "Lizzie: I didn't...",
        "Ava: Eat it! You ruin everything! ( Both screaming and yelling at each other ) Don't, don't, don't. Eat it. ( Laughter )",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) Wow!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Mom, could you come down here? I kind of... I kind of did something. ( Sighs ) It wasn't supposed to be like this. How could he stop loving me when I still love him so much?",
        "Beth: I don't know, honey. And if I could, I would make it better.",
        "Lizzie: I can do it. Help me get him back. It's not like I am some waitress with chewed-off fingernails. She was living in a car, Mom. It's like Coop trading me for a bag lady.",
        "Beth: Okay, you're right. You're right. But first let's go home and we'll get something to eat.",
        "Lizzie: I can't. I haven't been able to keep anything down since Coop left me. I'm exhausted all the time and I'm crying myself to sleep every single night. It's like my heart is in my stomach. I wake up in the morning, I just want to vomit. Are you okay?",
        "Beth: Yeah, just don't say that word.",
        "Lizzie: \"Vomit?\"",
        "Beth: Mmm. Yeah. I seem to be having another bout of morning sickness. I don't remember it being this late in the pregnancy with you and James, but dizzy, nausea... ( laughs ) ...tired. It's no way to go through the day. Ooh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I'm tired all the time. I can't eat. Oh, get them away from me. I feel sick. Being this close to you is making me dizzy. No. No, there is no way. Oh, I'm gonna be sick. Positive? Negative? Okay, come here, girl. Come here. Okay, how do you work this thing? Okay. Are they serious? On the stick? How gross. Okay, only three minutes, Roxy, and then we'll know. I can't be pregnant, right? It's probably just... it's probably just the flu. I mean, I slept with... okay, I slept with Coop on... and then I slept with Jonathan on April 10. That was the day of the Flower Festival. Okay. That sounds worse. It happens to a lot of people. ( Knock on the door )",
        "Alan: Elizabeth?",
        "Lizzie: Granddad, what horrible timing. Okay, do not even breathe in the direction of the bathroom.",
        "Alan: Why didn't you open the door? Is something wrong?",
        "Lizzie: No, I tripped over Roxy, and this is really not a good time, Granddad. Maybe I could call you tomorrow.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, you don't have to hide anything. Your mother told me everything.",
        "Lizzie: She did.",
        "Alan: Now, you have to remember when you get involved with a Cooper, it turns into being a disaster.",
        "Lizzie: Yes, it was. It was terrible.",
        "Alan: Terrible? It was a crime. I mean, you paid for this boy's party that you threw, then they had you arrested. I mean, I'm thinking about a lawsuit.",
        "Lizzie: No, Granddad, it is okay.",
        "Alan: No, it is not okay.",
        "Lizzie: You know why, because I'm not going to let the Coopers break my spirit. I am a Spaulding and it's about time people starting treating me like one.",
        "Alan: That's the way I like to hear you talk, Elizabeth. Very special. ( Alarm ringing ) What is that?",
        "Lizzie: That's my alarm clock. Yeah, it's broken.",
        "Alan: Are you cooking something?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, right. It just keeps going off. But you know what, maybe it's a sign.. maybe it's a sign that it's about time for me to start standing on my two feet and taking care of my own problems. I learned that from you. And I love you so much. Yeah, I do. Okay, bye.",
        "Alan: Wha...",
        "Lizzie: ( Sighs ) ( knock on the door ) What... Buzz, what are you doing here?",
        "Buzz: Hi. Can about we talk?",
        "Lizzie: Maybe tomorrow...",
        "Buzz: How about today?",
        "Lizzie: Okay, how did I know that you were going to say that?",
        "Buzz: Listen, I cannot understand all of the things you do, but I've got a soft spot for you, I'm rooting for you. There is a lot of good in you, but it just hasn't found it's way out yet. It hasn't learned yet. You and Coop, if it worked out differently, if you timed it differently, maybe later on it would have worked out.",
        "Lizzie: Why are you being nice to me?",
        "Buzz: Because I've known you since you were a little girl. I watched you grow up. I watched you fight leukemia. You're a strong, strong lady.",
        "Lizzie: That's the second time I heard that tonight.",
        "Buzz: Well, maybe it's because you are. Look, you know, some people remember you because of your bad behavior. But you know why I remember you. I remember a girl who gave me my restaurant back, a girl who fought her whole family to fit in with mine. You made a mistake. So, you made mistakes. So, I don't think you should be alone tonight.",
        "Lizzie: That is so sweet, Buzz. But you know something, I am not alone. I have Roxy. Yeah.",
        "Buzz: I'll tell you what, I'll drop you off at Lillian's or your mom's. Can I use your bathroom because I got some frosting on my pants.",
        "Lizzie: No, if you have frosting on your pants, that is your own fault.",
        "Buzz: No, actually, it's yours.",
        "Lizzie: So, you just come here to tell me I've ruined Coop's whole birthday party? Yeah, okay, where are they? Where are the rest of the Lizzie lynchers. Come on, Coopers, come out, get out before I sic Roxy on you. Yeha, get out.",
        "Buzz: You know, you should talk to someone.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, out! ( Sighs ) ( knock on the door ) What is going on? What do you... hi. No, I don't want to see anyone.",
        "Coop: Look, we're not. We're going to be alone.",
        "Lizzie: ( Sighs ) Okay.",
        "Lizzie: I thought when you said you wanted to be alone, that... no way. Why are we here? Is this some kind of cruel joke, because it isn't funny.",
        "Coop: No, Lizzie, I'm not trying to hurt you. I just needed to bring you someplace so you would listen.",
        "Lizzie: You brought me here...",
        "Coop: To talk. All we're doing is talking.",
        "Lizzie: When my dad tried to kidnap me, you saved me. And when he was killed and I was grieving, you stood beside me. When I found out that it was my granddad that did it, you helped me through it. You have been the only good thing in my entire life, and now you are going to dump me here, outside my dad's tomb?",
        "Coop: Lizzie, I am not dumping you, okay? I'm trying to get through to you. I am just worried about you. Do you remember when your dad was falling apart? You were so hurt because you wanted to help him and he wouldn't let you.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, okay, so I need help right now. Psycho Lizzie. I'm just psycho...",
        "Coop: Would you stop. Just stop it.",
        "Lizzie: It's in my genes, isn't it? It's just a matter of time before I go off?",
        "Coop: You don't have to go off, though, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: No. No, I could see some more therapists, I could maybe go to another camp for freaks. I thought you were different. I thought you believed in me.",
        "Coop: I do. I do believe in you, Lizzie, but you need to step back and you need to take a look at yourself. What you did tonight, Ava could have seriously been hurt.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, Ava, Ava, Ava. Ava is the only thing that you care about.",
        "Coop: Oh, damn it, Lizzie, that is not true. You scared me tonight. And you know what, and I think you scared yourself. Lizzie, you rigged that elevator. You pushed Ava into it. It's like you took somebody and you made them hostage. That's something you can go to jail for. That is something that your dad would have done.",
        "Lizzie: No, it wasn't like that.",
        "Coop: You were hurt because your father did what he wanted to do without any regard for anyone else. And you know what, that's exactly how you acted tonight. And you are better than that, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: You made me better than that. Without you, I will become just like the rest of my family.",
        "Coop: No, no. It is a choice. But you can make the right one. Lizzie, you have overcome so much. I mean, you can get over us.",
        "Lizzie: What if I can't? What if everything is ruined forever?",
        "Coop: No, no. Guilt will not work here, all right? I've seen you play that card 100 different times, right? Look who you're talking to. It's me, Lizzie. It's Coop.",
        "Lizzie: So why do you think... why do you think you don't love me anymore? You can love me, love me.",
        "Coop: Look, I wanted to. I really wanted it to work. Look, did you ever think that maybe we were meant to meet each other right now because maybe I was meant to be the guy that would help you come out from underneath this power, this control that your family had over you.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, great. So, what, I was a project, and now your work here is done?",
        "Coop: Lizzie... look, look at me. Someday in the not so distant future you are going to meet a man who is going to love you the way you deserved to be loved, the way Lizzie wants to be loved. And then you know what, you're going to forget all about me.",
        "Lizzie: No, no, I won't. I can't.",
        "Coop: Lizzie. I'm not him. I'm not that guy.",
        "Lizzie: (Sobbing ) Coop is gone. I had so many stupid dreams for us-- getting married, living in granddad's mansion, driving matching sports cars, which we would have traded in for a minivan as soon as... oh, my gosh, okay. Okay, Roxy, stay here and keep your toes crossed. Okay, well, the box says that if I'm pregnant, the stick will turn blue. It's kind of hard to tell in this light. I left this one in too long because it was... it was a really long time. I just... I need to try it again, yeah. How can this be? I can't even take care of myself. What am I going to do with a baby? Sometimes I'm not even sure if I fed you. ( Sighs ) No, I can't be a mom. I'm too young. I don't have the wardrobe.",
        "Man: Miss, are you okay?",
        "Lizzie: It's just a stomachache. I'm not... I'm not.",
        "Lillian: Lizzie? What a wonderful surprise. Sweetheart. Honey, what is it? What's the matter?",
        "Lizzie: Nana, I don't know what's wrong with me. I screw everything up. I'm trying so hard. And it's going okay for a while, and then I just... I blow everything up. It's like my entire life it is me verses me.",
        "Lillian: Sweetie, we all feel like that sometimes. I mean, especially after we made a mistake, or something.",
        "Lizzie: I am a big mistake.",
        "Lillian: You are not. Now, you come and tell me what happened?",
        "Lizzie: I was born, that's what happened. Look at me, I have never been normal. I shot someone when I was supposed to be playing with dolls. Of course I can't keep a guy. I mean, bullet-proof vests are so last year.",
        "Lillian: I take it this is about Coop.",
        "Lizzie: It's about everything. I can't get a break.",
        "Lillian: Oh, sweetheart, sweetie. Oh, how I wish I could tell you it's going to get easier, but life is so full of challenges. And that's why you're so lucky that you're such a strong, resilient young woman.",
        "Lizzie: You're the strong one. I have no idea how you did it, how you've been through everything that you've been through.",
        "Lillian: Believe me, at your age I was not strong. I had to learn from my mistakes. And let me tell you, and your mother helped a lot.",
        "Lizzie: How does that make a difference?",
        "Lillian: Well, I had to be strong. I decided I had to be strong and protect my daughter. And protecting Beth became my life's work. Of course, I realized I couldn't take care of all her problems. She had to face them on her own. You know what helped her?",
        "Lizzie: Sedatives?",
        "Lillian: No. Lizzie, you.",
        "Lizzie: So, the meaning of life, it's being a mom?",
        "Lillian: No, no, not at all, honey. It's just that when you're a mom, you love someone more than you love yourself. You put someone ahead of you.",
        "Lizzie: But you and mom were all alone, and me and mom were alone when dad left us in Arizona. And having a baby, and doing that all by yourself, that's really hard. Didn't you just want to run away?",
        "Lillian: Never. And that's why I know that you're going to be okay.",
        "Lizzie: You know. You can tell.",
        "Lillian: I know that we're survivors, Lizzie. And things are calming down right now. I mean, your grandfather's home, your mother and your grandfather are having a baby, which we know is not perfect, is it? But something wonderful is going to come out of that. You're going to have a little baby brother or sister. You know, having a baby is such a wonderful event, and it shows you things are turning around. So you just have to hang in there.",
        "Lizzie: Hang in?",
        "Lillian: Yes. I want you to have faith in yourself. I want you to realized how loved you are. You know, when you and James were born, you brought so much joy into this family. You really did. Having a baby is just a wonderful event. Why are you here?",
        "Lizzie: I... it was a stomachache.",
        "Lillian: Do you want me to call Mel to examine...",
        "Lizzie: No. It's... it's not that bad anymore. I love you, Nana. Talking to you made me feel better.",
        "Lillian: You sure you don't want me to call a doctor?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. You are exactly the medicine that I needed. I really do feel better.",
        "Lillian: What? Oh, honey, come. What a precious baby. Hello sweetie. My granddaughter and I were just discussing how wonderful a new baby is.",
        "Woman: Would you like to hold the baby?",
        "Lizzie: No, no, I can't.",
        "Lillian: Oh, yes, yes, you would, honey. Words come out of my mouth and I can't seem to trace what I'm saying everybody wants your time I'm just dreaming out loud I can't have you for mine and I know it I just want to watch you shine tripping up on my tongue it's all over my face and I'm racing got to get away from you burning all the way home try to put her to bed but it chases every little thing I do when the light falls on your face don't let it change you when the stars get in your eyes don't let it blind you, oh you're beautiful just the way you are and I love it all...",
        "Lizzie: Guess what, Daddy, I am going to be a mom. ...And I wish that I could make you see...",
        "Lizzie: I wish that you were here to help me. Even though I wouldn't really want to tell you about it, because I don't think you'd be real happy. But I know that you would help me. Spell it out in a song that you never catch onto my weakness I'm singing every word for you. Here I'm thinking I'm sly then you're catching my eye and just maybe you're thinking what I'm thinking too when you see it on my face don't let it shake you I know better than try to take you with me you're beautiful just the way you are and I love it all every line and every scare and I wish I could make you see this is where you ought to be come down to me come down to me.",
