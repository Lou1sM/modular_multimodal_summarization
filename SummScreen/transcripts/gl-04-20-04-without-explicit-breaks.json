        "Alan: I know you did, sweetheart. I know you did. And I really wanted to come and see you in your play, but unfortunately, I have to fly to washington, D.C.",
        "Lizzie: So just reschedule it.",

        "Alexandra: No, just unfamiliar surroundings. Thank you. I'm so delighted with my new room.",
        "Alan: You know, we had no choice in that matter.",
        "Alexandra: No, you could have put your foot down, alan. You could have. Olivia didn't need that room. She did it out of spite.",

        "Phillip: Don'T... don'T... just alan.",
        "Rick: Okay.",
        "Phillip: You have to remember. And you have to be clear about that though. And make sure that you make him understand that olivia can't know anything about this.",
        "Rick: I understand.",
        "Phillip: You do?",
        "Rick: Yes.",
        "Phillip: Okay.",
        "Rick: Speaking of olivia, buddy, I can't help but ink you didn't have all your faculties when you got married to her. I really see it as being tied in this marriage has been very destructive for you. So...",
        "Phillip: It's all right. Everything worked out for the best. Really. It's okay. We have a child together. Yes, we do. You know what?",
        "Rick: What?",

        "Phillip: I'm sure he does. I'm very happy for you.",
        "Rick: Thanks, buddy. What?",
        "Phillip: Is there something going on? It seems like there's buzzing the hall all day, but I have access to a tv or two in this place.",
        "Rick: Wait. There's all kinds of buzz going on around here.",
        "Phillip: Well, man, don't hold back.",
        "Rick: Oh, yeah.",
        "Phillip: Please tell me. Because what I am is news deprived. Good or bad, I'll take it.",
        "Rick: Good news for your family. And possibly some good news for my family, too.",
        "Phillip: First things first. Good news for my family?",
        "Rick: Yeah.",
        "Phillip: That would be a refreshing change. What?",
        "Ross: Hi.",
        "Rick: Oh. Here he is folks, the new mayor of springfield.",
        "Eden: Bill, come to bed. Honey, I know you're disappointed about danny that he should have won the election. But the recount said otherwise.",
        "Bill: Well, that's not what's bothering me, eden?",
        "Eden: What then?",
        "Bill: What people are saying about danny buying votes, well, all that is true. He is the lying thief that everyone says he is.",
        "Danny: Yeah, it's me.",
        "Jeffrey: Good morning.",
        "Danny: For you maybe. The tv crews are on their way over to broadcast my concession. I've got to get michelle out of the house before they get here.",
        "Jeffrey: So do it.",
        "Danny: I'll call you back.",
        "Michelle: Who's that?",
        "Danny: Tony. I'll call him back. What are you doing? Are you going somewhere?",
        "Michelle: Yeah, I got some patients I have to see at the hospital. And then I'm going to drop some stuff off for the clinic. So, I can hurry up and come back and concentrate on you.",
        "Danny: Good. Every husband's dream.",
        "Michelle: I still feel the same way I did last night. We'll stick together and we're going to fight.",
        "Danny: Michelle...",
        "Michelle: And I will be right back. I just got to go and do what i have to do, okay?",
        "Danny: Bye.",
        "Michelle: Bye.",
        "Jeffrey: Well?",
        "Danny: She's gone.",
        "Jeffrey: Good. You know what you got to do. So do it. Good luck. (knocking at the door)",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, leave it out there. (Knocking continues) I said leave it out there! (Knocking gets louder) what is your problem?",
        "Michelle: What's yours? What have you got against my husband, mr. O'neill?",
        "Jeffrey: I don't have anything against your husband. The recount didn't come from my office, all right. It happens to be mandated by law. And the results are what they are. Danny lost. I know you wanted a different result, but...",
        "Michelle: Yeah, of course i did. But I was also prepared for the possibility that he might lose. But that's not the issue. The issue are these rumors that are circulating. People saying that danny tried to buy this election.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I can't control what people say.",
        "Michelle: Sure you can. You know these accusations are groundless and your office has done nothing to dispel them.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, what can i say? Mobsters and politics make for strange bed fellows.",
        "Michelle: Look, I know danny. And I know how hard danny has worked these past few months to try to be the kind of man that this town would be proud to have as mayor. But you supported him for god's sake. Have you forgotten why?",
        "Jeffrey: I haven't forgotten.",
        "Michelle: Then why don't you defend him? Hold a press conference, set the record straight. I know you can't give him back this election, but you can give him back his good name.",
        "Jeffrey: What do you want me to do? You want me to lie like danny did? Danny made a choice. He made the wrong one. Now he's got to pay for it.",
        "Michelle: I don't know why you're trying to destroy my husband. But I do know that you are going to have to go through me to do it.",
        "Eden: Danny admitted it. He flat out told you that he tried to fix the election?",
        "Bill: Mm-hmm. And I didn't have a clue, you know. How could I have not seen it?",
        "Eden: Because you believed in danny. We thought he had changed. We thought he was good for the town. We all did, all right?",
        "Bill: Just listen to me. Thanks. But you know what? I'm the campaign manager. All right, I'm the one that's suppose to be on top of everything. I see every check coming in, i see every check coming out. I... the checks.",
        "Eden: Do not do this.",
        "Bill: I am so stupid. I am so stupid.",
        "Eden: Do not do this. Do not doubt yourself.",
        "Bill: He's not talking about the checks. All right, danny got a check from vinnie salerno, but of course he refused it. He said he no longer want to be connected to that life, but then out of the blues salerno shows up at the big fund raiser.",
        "Eden: He did?",
        "Bill: Yeah. I mean I should have seen it coming. I guess once your in that life you just don't walk away from it. Just...",
        "Eden: Maybe danny's tried. Maybe salerno has something on him, all right?",
        "Bill: No. The truth is danny never turned his life around. He and salerno probably been working together from the beginning and danny's just as crooked as he was from day one.",
        "Tony: Question of the day.",
        "Danny: What's going on? Want some coffee? I've got cuban stuff.",
        "Tony: You do? Vodka?",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Tony: I thought you stopped drinking that?",
        "Danny: Old habits die hard, i guess. You want it?",
        "Tony: The stronger the better, you know that. What are you going to do about this, danny? I read this morning in the paper that you're not contesting the recount. That you concedeto ross in private last night. Is that right?",
        "Danny: For once, the press gets something right.",
        "Tony: Why not fight this thing, danny?",
        "Danny: Because ross won the recount, tony. He has the votes.",
        "Tony: Well, then you know what? At least get the press to print a retraction about what they're saying about vote tampering.",
        "Danny: Sh...",
        "Tony: It's going to ruin your reputation, danny!",
        "Danny: Just let it be. I am.",
        "Tony: You know what? I'm not going to let it be. This is what I don't understand. You didn't do anything wrong. You're clean. Everyone in town knows you're clean. Am I right?",
        "Danny: There's no way to prove I didn't do it, tony.",
        "Tony: Well, you know what? There's one way to fix this mess, danny. You tell them I did it.",
        "Olivia: Oh, this is a good muffin. Good, good muffin. Hey, can I tap your mind?",
        "Alexandra: Of course not, darling. Which way would you like me to jump? I'm kidding. Of course. Please. You can walk anywhere in this house, olivia. You and that beautiful baby of yours. And how is emma this morning? Did she sleep well last night?",
        "Olivia: Yeah, she only woke up once.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I heard her do the crying, you know.",
        "Olivia: Well, how could you hear her? Your room is all the way down the hall.",
        "Lizzie: I was rehearsing if you have to know. It sure did take you long enough to get to her. I was tempted to go help her myself, but I figured, you know, you'd probably walk in and have a fit.",
        "Olivia: You figured right.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, yeah, cooky lizzie, she can't be trusted can she? Even though emma had an absolutely wonderful time when we were together?",
        "Olivia: When you were together? Oh, you mean when you kidnapped her.",
        "Lizzie: No, I didn't kidnap her. All I did was bring her to go see dad.",
        "Olivia: Oh, is that what you keep telling yourself?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, because it's the truth.",
        "Beth: Okay, you two. That's enough. Lizzie aware that what she did was wrong, but she didn't hurt emma. So why don't we all just try to move on.",
        "Olivia: Oh, beth, always the loyal mother.",
        "Alexandra: Take a lesson.",
        "Olivia: I'll get a pen and paper.",
        "Lizzie: You know, I was just trying to help dad. That's why I brought emma to see him.",
        "Olivia: Okay, let's assume that's true-- it isn't, but let's just assume that it is. Your father is mentally ill.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, obviously. He did marry you, didn't he?",
        "Olivia: That's so funny. Okay. But if you believe that his judgement is that impaired then why would you do what he asked you to do and take emma without my consent?",
        "Lizzie: Because she is his child, too.",
        "Olivia: Well, in the future don't be so quick to do what your father asked you to do, because he doesn't always knows what's best for him.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, and you do?",
        "Olivia: I do as a matter of fact. I also know what's best for you.",
        "Alan: Please, ladies, enough of this, all right?",
        "Lizzie: Hey, she started it.",
        "Beth: Let's just drop it. No one started anything.",
        "Olivia: No, she's right. I started something. I want to finish it.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, wait here she goes with her speech about how bad lizzie is. And she's just a paragon of virtue, isn't she? Not.",
        "Olivia: Oh, no. All I was going to suggest is that you try a little consistency.",
        "Lizzie: Excuse me?",
        "Olivia: Consistency. No, I just... it changes from day to day. Some days your message is poor me and then sometimes it's trust me. You can't have it both ways, lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Does anyone have any idea what she's talking about?",
        "Olivia: I'm just suggesting that you be the adult that you claim that you are. That you take responsibility for your actions like you said you would the other night. I mean if you want people to take you seriously and believe what you say then you can't say one thing and do another, lizzie. You have to step up to the plate. Stop making excuses for your behavior.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. I will. If you will.",
        "Olivia: All right, you're on. From this moment on, we turn over a new leaf, okay? So how should we begin?",
        "Lizzie: Excuse me?",
        "Olivia: How do we begin to heal this rift between us? You know, get back on track. So we can live in this house in peace. How do we begin?",
        "Alexandra: More coffee.",
        "Olivia: Come on. I have an idea. You want to hear my idea?",
        "Lizzie: Okay, yeah. Go ahead.",
        "Olivia: Well, I think we need to focus on the thing that we have in common instead of what divides us. And what we have in common is your father. We both love him. And I know that you're disappointed that he can't come to your opening, so what if i came in his place? How would that be?",
        "Beth: Olivia, that's so nice of you, but it's really not necessary.",
        "Alexandra: Actually, there's a whole group of us going.",
        "Olivia: Well, that's all the more reason that I should go and make it a real family affair. What do you say? I mean, I want to show some good faith. I want to show that I support you. What do you say, lizzie? I'm game if you are.",
        "Phillip: Ross, that's best news I've had in ages.",
        "Ross: Well, thank you. I didn't know if I'd be able to do it without your vote.",
        "Phillip: (Laughs) obviously, you didn't need me.",
        "Ross: Lizzie told me I had the support of most of the family. Although she said I was a little iffy where alan was concerned.",
        "Phillip: Well, I'd been a little surprised if you had alan's vote. I think alan and I navigated each other in every major election for the last twenty- five years. (Laughter) hey, I bet blake must be over the moon.",
        "Ross: Over the moon. Out buying power suits and everything. There's even talk of matching outfits at the inauguration.",
        "Phillip: Oh, for you and blake?",
        "Ross: With the kids.",
        "Phillip: Oh.",
        "Ross: With the kids. Although kevin and jacob it's going to take a bit of arguing to get them to agree to that.",
        "Phillip: I think I'm even happier for blake than I am for you. I know she's been carrying around a lot of guilt since she stepped out from the senate.",
        "Ross: Well, I must admit, she seems relieved. And I think that she's going to be working hard right along next to me once I'm in office and everything's official. How is michelle holing up?",
        "Rick: She's a little disappointed, ross. But you know what? She'll get past it.",
        "Ross: She wasn't quite herself when I saw her last night. She was so hurt and disappointed. I felt terrible for her. And for danny as well.",
        "Rick: Yeah, dad and I talked about for quite awhile.",
        "Phillip: I didn't even think about what this must mean in your family.",
        "Ross: Well, it's been tough from the very smart. I mean, obviously, ross, it put you in an awkward position with my dad and I can't help but think that danny should never run for office in the first place. I mean all those skeletons were bound to come out the closet, which in fact it did. Which I guess made for an exciting racer, right?",
        "Ross: Unfortunately, it ended the way I was afraid it was going to end... with danny's past catching up with him.",
        "Phillip: I don't know if you can ever leave that kind of life in the past.",
        "Rick: I keep hoping for my sister's sake that he can. But it's been tough from the very beginning.",
        "Eden: I used to think that it was so unfair that danny had lost, but now it's a blessing. Bill, if danny had won the election, you know you could have been in big trouble just by association.",
        "Bill: Eden, I would have handled it.",
        "Eden: But still, why do you have to?",
        "Bill: You know what? It's not even me I'm worried about, okay. It's michelle really.",
        "Eden: I know. I love how you care about your friends, but...",
        "Bill: Listen when she finds out that...",
        "Eden: She doesn't know?",
        "Bill: No. No. And when she finds out, it's going to break her heart.",
        "Eden: Honey, michelle... michelle is a grown woman. She knew who danny was when she married him. What are you going to do? You're going to tell her?",
        "Bill: No, it's not place. I mean danny should do it. Because of course he's not going to, because he's a liar. Nothing but a liar. You know I just can't wait to see how he plays it on air today, you know. Eden:N the air?",
        "Bill: Yeah, he's going to make a statement. He's going to officially conceded. I know just how he's going to play it, too. Like he was a victim. Like somehow he was wronged.",
        "Eden: If danny is going on tv, you have to be with him.",
        "Bill: No, I don'T.",
        "Eden: Yes, you do. Honey, listen to me. You have to be right by his side. If you're not, people are going to think that you're hiding something.",
        "Bill: Then let them. I'm not going anywhere near that press conference.",
        "Eden: And what if that's what danny wants? He's up against it, right? He's desperate to save his own skin. He wants to come out of this looking good, right?",
        "Bill: Yeah. So?",
        "Eden: And what is the easiest way to do that? By making somebody else look bad. And if you were danny and you want a fall guy, your campaign manager is the obvious choice.",
        "Bill: You know what? You're absolutely right. You are. No, no, no. You are. You're right. What am I doing here? What am I doing? That's it. Okay. You know what? I'm going to go over there. But I'm not afraid of hat he's going to say, but I just I want him to look me in the eye when he says it. Okay.",
        "Eden: Okay.",
        "Bill: So I will see you soon, all right? (Phone rings)",
        "Eden: Hello?",
        "Salerno: How are you holding up, sweetheart?",
        "Eden: Vinnie, what do you want?",
        "Salerno: I just want to hear your voice. How's your boy doing?",
        "Eden: Bill is fine.",
        "Salerno: Life's full of surprises, huh? See you soon.",
        "Eden: Not if I see you first.",
        "Danny: I'm not going to tell them you did it.",
        "Tony: Danny, if you would have come to me... if you would have come to me your hands would have been clean right hand. I don't care about me. I don't care about me, danny. Can't you see that? I don't care about me. I'm not clean. I'm never going to be clean. Look at me. I have not... I have not helped in any way to change the family image, man. It's been you and only you. All right.",
        "Danny: Tony...",
        "Tony: Tony, what? This is what you're going to do? This is what you're going to do, danny? You're going to call the press right now. You're going to set up... you're going to set up a press conference, you're going to get in front of that camera. I'm talking to you.",
        "Danny: I'm not going to do that.",
        "Tony: You're going to get in front of the camera right now and you're going to get all choked up and you're going to tell them that you made a mistake. You're going to tell them you made a mistake, danny.",
        "Danny: No way. No way.",
        "Tony: No matter what your mistake was, it was...",
        "Danny: No.",
        "Tony: ...It was one that you regret.",
        "Danny: No.",
        "Tony: That you put your faith into someone that you may have trusted or not have trusted and he blew it. You understand me?",
        "Danny: No.",
        "Tony: It was me. Yes.",
        "Danny: No.",
        "Tony: Your cousin.",
        "Danny: Forget it.",
        "Tony: Danny, damn it! Tell them I did it! Please!",
        "Danny: Tony, I tell them that you did it and what do you think happens to you? You go to vailsberg? That's what happens.",
        "Tony: I don'T.... I don't care. For what, a year or two? At least, you're out of this whole thing.",
        "Danny: Are you kidding me?",
        "Tony: Yes. I don't care. At least you're out of the whole thing, danny. You could still run for another campaign. You could do whatever the hell you want to do. At least you're out of it. Now call the press conference now.",
        "Danny: I already did, okay. I made the arrangements last night. Spr's on their way right now.",
        "Tony: Okay, good. Then when thy get here then you can...",
        "Danny: I will make a speech, but I am not blaming you. Forget it.",
        "Tony: Why are you being so stubborn? I don't understand what's going on.",
        "Danny: Because everything they're saying about me is true, okay. I'm guilty.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. Three o'clock is good. All right. Bye.",
        "Michelle: So what are you saying? That danny did tamper with this election? That he did try to buy votes?",
        "Jeffrey: What do you think, michelle?",
        "Michelle: I think that you're the da and if you honestly believed that he did something illegal, you would have announced it publicly.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, really.",
        "Michelle: If you have proof, you would have...",
        "Jeffrey: Well, maybe I do have proof. Maybe your husband and I made a deal...",
        "Michelle: Oh, no. You're lying.",
        "Jeffrey: You know, deep down I do believe that danny is a good guy, but he was brought up in a certain way.",
        "Michelle: No, you're wrong. You're wrong.",
        "Jeffrey: He was brought up in a god forsaken family. He's got a certain mind set that he can't escape. It's in his blood.",
        "Michelle: No, no. Danny has changed.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, has he?",
        "Michelle: People can change.",
        "Jeffrey: He's changed has he? How much has he changed? Hmm? To the point where he would never do anything behind your back?",
        "Michelle: Never, never.",
        "Jeffrey: (Laughs)",
        "Michelle: We don't keep secrets from each other. Danny tells me everything.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, really? So I suppose he told you all about the press conference he's about to give in a couple of minutes on tv? Officially conceding the election. Did he tell you that? Oprah: Attacked at gunpoint in her bed.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, danny scheduled a pretty major press conference and he didn't tell you anything about it.",
        "Michelle: He didn't get the chance, because I left while he was in the shower to come see you.",
        "Jeffrey: Right. Oh. Oh, right, to come see me. And I suppose you told him that you were going to come see me, too?",
        "Michelle: No.",
        "Jeffrey: No.",
        "Michelle: I said I was going to see some patients in the hospital.",
        "Jeffrey: So you kept that little something from him. So what makes you think that he wouldn't keep something from you? Why are you so surprised that he kept something from you? And I'm not talking about the press conference, michelle. You love him, okay. And I admire your loyalty. But it's time you woke up and took off your blinders?",
        "Michelle: You know what? Don't tell me what to do.",
        "Jeffrey: And grow up, okay. Grow up, go home to your very flawed husband, okay. And be thankful that I'm a nice guy and didn't throw him in jail!",
        "Michelle: I don't know what marah sees in you.",
        "Jeffrey: What she saw in me. That's over. Just like this conversation. Get out.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. Yeah, you can come see me. You could use grandpa's ticket because he won't be able top use it. So...",
        "Olivia: Yeah? Are you sure you're okay with that?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. Very sure. You know, you're right. We need to get this negative stuff behind us and... for dad's sake at least. So I think this would be a good step, you know.",
        "Rick: Hey.",
        "Lizzie: Uncle rick.",
        "Rick: (Laughs) good morning, everybody.",
        "Beth rick: Hey.",
        "Rick: Hey, sweetheart. Good to see you.",
        "Beth: Rick. What a nice surprise.",
        "Rick: Hey, beth. Hey, I understand tomorrow's the big opening night.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, are you coming?",
        "Rick: You know what? I'm trying. I have to work tomorrow, but I'm trying to get somebody to fill in for me.",
        "Lizzie: Okay.",
        "Rick: So we'll see.",
        "Beth: You know, you're going to be late for school. You better get going.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, I will.",
        "Rick: All right. See, sweetheart.",
        "Lizzie: Bye-bye, everyone.",
        "Alexandra: Bye, darling.",
        "Alan: Oh, rick, what do we owe the honor of your visit?",
        "Rick: I just need to talk to you about something, alan.",
        "Olivia: Is it phillip?",
        "Rick: No, it's just actually it's hospital board stuff. But it is confidential, so if you'd like, we can go someplace else and talk about it.",
        "Beth: No. No, no. We're all finished here. I'm sure we have places to go, things to do, right? Well, rick.",
        "Rick: See you, sweetie.",
        "Beth: Come and see me before you leave and say good bye.",
        "Rick: I will. I sure will. Okay.",
        "Alexandra: Olivia, shall we go?",
        "Alan: What's going on at cedars? I just spoke with charles yesterday. He didn't say anything.",
        "Rick: Alan, I lied. It has nothing to do with cedars. It's about phillip. He wanted me to talk to you about something. He didn't want olivia to be present.",
        "Alan: What does he want to talk about?",
        "Rick: I think it's safe to say that the honeymoon with olivia is over.",
        "Beth: Olivia, can I speak to you for a moment?",
        "Olivia: Sure.",
        "Beth: Alone. If you don't mind, alexandra?",
        "Alexandra: Of course.",
        "Beth: Thank you. It's about lizzie.",
        "Olivia: What about her?",
        "Beth: I'm assuming your offer to go to her play in phillip place was a genuine one.",
        "Olivia: Yes, of course it was.",
        "Beth: Good. Then I thank you for it. But lizzie is under a lot of pressure. She's worried about remembering her lines, her costume isn't finished.",
        "Olivia: And you think my presence will just add to it.",
        "Beth: Exactly. I'll let her know that you didn't back out. That it was my idea.",
        "Olivia: You know what, beth? Whatever you want. You're her mother.",
        "Beth: Good. And as long as we're on the subject, since we'll be living under the same roof, I think we need to get a few other things straight, too.",
        "Tony: You what? Hmm?",
        "Danny: You heard me. (Door bell rings)",
        "Tony: Don't get it, danny. Don't get that not till we're done here. Do not get that.",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Tony: Danny? Danny? Damn it!",
        "Danny: Hey, kate. Come on in.",
        "Reporter: Good morning, danny.",
        "Danny: Good morning. Good morning, guys. Set up in the living room. Why don't you... I thought maybe you could just set up right over there in front of the fireplace.",
        "Camera man: I think that would be pretty good. Thank you.",
        "Reporter: How did you want to do this?",
        "Danny: I'm going to make a statement and then we could follow up with a few questions.",
        "Reporter: Okay. Along with your campaign manager? Myself today. Let me know when you're ready.",
        "Tony: Danny?",
        "Danny: I don't have time, tony. I need to do this.",
        "Tony: Alone?",
        "Danny: Alone. That's right.",
        "Tony: Danny, every time you've made a statement, every time you've done something like this, somebody's been by your side whether it was michelle or bill. What are you doing...",
        "Danny: Forget about bill.",
        "Tony: Okay, fine. Then michelle. She needs to be here by your side. People need to see that. Where is she?",
        "Danny: No. There was an emergency at thee hospital.",
        "Tony: Danny, get her back here right now.",
        "Danny: This is how I'm going to do it, you hear me?",
        "Reporter: Danny?",
        "Danny: Yeah, you're ready for me?",
        "Reporter: Yeah, we're all set. Come on.",
        "Danny: All right.",
        "Tony: Don't do this, danny.",
        "Danny: I will see you later.",
        "Tony: Don'T...",
        "Danny: I'll see you later. Wish me luck.",
        "Tony: I'm not going to wish you luck.",
        "Danny: Fine.",
        "Bill: Oh, good. I thought you were going to start without me.",
        "Tony: I had no idea you'd be here, bill.",
        "Bill: What? And bailing your cousin whose been nothing honest and up front with me? Excuse me. Danny, I'm sorry I'm late.",
        "Danny: What are you doing here?",
        "Bill: I've been with you every step of the way. You don't think I'm going to bail on you now, do you? We're in this together?",
        "Reporter: Mr. Santos, we're ready.",
        "Reporter: Ready?",
        "Danny: Ready.",
        "Cameraman: In five, four, three...",
        "Reporter: Good morning. We're live with danny santos whose going to issue a statement about the controversy rrounding the recent mayoral elections.",
        "Danny: Thank you, kate. Good morning. As you probably already know the springfield election board just finished it's recount of last week's election. The new certified result is that I did not win the race as originally stated. Many of you have urged me to challenge the recount in court, I've decided not to go that route. So late last night, I officially conceded the election. Ross marler will be your next mayor.",
        "Phillip: Danny bought votes? That's bad cliche.",
        "Ross: Well, phillip, the investigation is on going. So nothing has been confirmed yet, but... you know for the life of me, it's just a part of me that that thinks he might have been set up because how could he be foolish enough to do something so obvious?",
        "Phillip: Unless that's what he was counting on?",
        "Ross: Yeah, well... who knows?",
        "Phillip: You feel guilty?",
        "Ross: A little bit. Don't get me wrong. I wanted to win, but this is not the way. I wanted to win.",
        "Phillip: Don't feel guilty, ross. You deserve this. And springfield deserves to have a mayor like you.",
        "Ross: Thank you. I can't tell you how much better you look than the last time i saw you.",
        "Phillip: Almost out of here. And I can't wait. I can't wait to get home. I can't wait to get back to the office.",
        "Ross: And to get back to that new little daughter of yours which was... that was a surprise for us. (Laughter)",
        "Phillip: Me, too. Me, too. But I love her. I love her.",
        "Ross: I bet you do. And she is lucky to have you as a father.",
        "Phillip: Well, that remains to be seen. But I'm going to do it.",
        "Ross: (Laughs)",
        "Lizzie: Hey, are you talking about me behind my back again?",
        "Phillip: Lizzie, hi.",
        "Ross: Hi, darling. You know, actually we were talking about... oh, thank you. Your new little sister.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, isn't she amazing? Have you seen her yet?",
        "Ross: No. No, not yet I haven'T.",
        "Lizzie: Well, wait till you do. She looks just like me... her eyes, everything.",
        "Phillip: Aren't you suppose to be in school?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, well, I just took a detour. Oh, my gosh! I almost forgot. Congratulations. I told you, you would win.",
        "Ross: That's right. Come here. You did tell me that I would win. She should be on my campaign staff.",
        "Lizzie: Can we come to inauguration?",
        "Ross: You have to come to my inauguration. I won't have any other way. And speaking of that, I have a million things to do. So I got to take off. Phillip, I love you. It's so good to see you getting back to your old self.",
        "Phillip: Take care... mayor. Thank you for bringing me the good news in person. I'm honored.",
        "Ross: Sure. Lizzie, you take care.",
        "Lizzie: Isn't that great?",
        "Phillip: It... it is truly the best news I've had in a long time. (Lizzie laughs)",
        "Phillip: But you are suppose to be at school. And if your mom finds out that you have ditched school to come here instead, we're both going to be in a lot of trouble.",
        "Lizzie: Tonight's my dress rehearsal for the play.",
        "Phillip: Are you ready?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, more than ready. (Laughs)",
        "Phillip: I wish I could be there, honey. I wish I could be there.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I was kind of hoping maybe they can give you some kind of pass or something to go.",
        "Phillip: I'll be at the next play. I promise. I will. I'm just at a point in the treatment where it would probably not be a good idea for me to go ahead and leave and do that now. But your mom's going to be there and lillian's going to be there and they're all going to take pictures to show me. So it'll actually... you know, I'll sort of be there in a way and I ordered you flowers. I wanted it to be a surprise. But I want you to know that if i could be there, I would be.",
        "Lizzie: Yes. Daddy, it's okay. Okay. I understand. All right. I know you would be there if you could. And it's fine. I'm fine with that. You're getting better and that's what matters.",
        "Jeffrey: Don't stop. You know what you have to do, man. Do it!",
        "Danny: By now most of you know about my background. I went into the family business at a young age. And I won't make excuses. I lived that life for awhile, because it was the only life i knew. It wasn't easy to leave the life behind. In fact, it was... it was hard as hell, but I did it. Because it had to be done. Of course, there were a lot of small-minded cynics out there who didn't believe that I really changed. Hey, I guess who could blame them. You want something...",
        "Salerno: Shut up. Shut up.",
        "Danny: But I did not care what those people said. I did what I knew I had to do. Which was to try somehow to make amends for all the pain my family had caused for so many...",
        "Tony: Jumpy, aren't you?",
        "Eden: Aren't we all?",
        "Tony: He's doing just fine.",
        "Eden: Such a liar.",
        "Beth: I understand that you're upset with my daughter. She's done some terrible things to you. But she was also correct when she said you're no saint yourself.",
        "Olivia: Yes, yes. I know. And according to you, I'm no more mature than lizzie.",
        "Beth: If you were, I wouldn't mind you dictating to my daughter the way you just did. But under circumstances, I found it not only presumptuous, but rude.",
        "Olivia: I wasn't dictating.",
        "Beth: So the next time you have the urge to bond with my daughter, I would appreciate it if you would run it by me first. And I'll offer you the same courtesy with your child.",
        "Rick: So felecia boudreaux has stepped in to take care of phillip now that christopher langham's out of the picture. And I will be the M.D. That will be consulting with her. So essentially, alan, I came here to get your permission to start a new therapy with phillip. It's called ect, electric convulsive therapy.",
        "Alan: Electric shock?",
        "Rick: Yeah.",
        "Alan: You want to put electrodes on phillip. Is that what you're saying?",
        "Rick: Ect is light years ahead of the way therapy used to be done. Alan, the side effects are minimal and sometimes the results are immediate. I have some literature for you to read.",
        "Alan: I'll definitely read this. But you feel that this therapy is what phillip needs?",
        "Rick: Yes, I do.",
        "Alan: He knows about this, he's all for it. This is what he wants? Well, then I think this is what we must do.",
        "Rick: There is one condition.",
        "Alan: What's that?",
        "Rick: He asked that olivia not know about this.",
        "Olivia: I'm sorry. I mean, if my conversation if it was this upsetting to you, i really do apologize. I just felt that you of all people would appreciate someone being honest with your daughter... for a change.",
        "Alexandra: Ladies, you've got to come hear this. Well, talk about realty tv.",
        "Danny: I poured my sweat and my soul into developing fifth street and I've turned that neighborhood around. And then I took what seemed to be the next logical step. I decided to run for mayor. Now that I've lost, those same people, those same people are still saying that I cheated. All I want to know is when will you people be finished with me? When will I be allowed to live like everybody else-- free of slander and hatred? Or is that just the price I have to pay for the rest of my life for being born with the last name? When is it going to stop? That's all I want to know. That's all I want to know. When is it going to stop? When?",
        "Michelle: It's okay.",
        "Danny: Honey.",
        "Michelle: I'm going to finish it for you. I know what you've done.",
        "Tony: It's unbelievable. I look at him and I think about how much I looked up to him. I was just a kid, he never let me forget that. I did everything in my power to make sure that he could count on me, you know? That he could trust me. That he could trust me. Never did. Never trusted a damn person. Not one single person, you know that?",
        "Eden: He doesn't even trust michelle, tony. Not even michelle.",
        "Tony: That's the other thing. Michelle. I wonder if they're going to make it through it. He's got everything that I've ever wanted. He's got an amazing child, a great life. A new life, in fact. Look at him. A beautiful wife and he blew it. He blew everything. Great job, danny! Sorry, guys.",
        "Eden: One person just screws up and it messes everyone else's life.",
        "Tony: Blows up in your face now, doesn't it? Blows up in your face. To my cousin danny. Good job.",
        "Michelle: This election may be over, but the fight for danny's reputation has just begun. If something happened illegal to influence the voting, it wasn't danny's doing, and we're going to prove that. We're going to stop the lies and give my husband his good name back. (Phone rings)",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah? Yeah, I see the wife. Don't worry, it's going to make it seem more real. No. No. He can't tell her. He knows the risks. Well, she's the loyal type; i don't think she'll leave him. He's going to have to drive her away.",
        "Alan: Next, on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Tammy: It's all because of you. I'm so glad you came into my life.",
        "Bill: I'm just going to do this.",
        "Michelle: So you're not going to help danny?",
        "Bill: I can'T."
