        "Cassie: You said everything was fine with the baby.",
        "Dr. Sedwick: With the baby, yes. But I'm afraid there's a problem with you, dinah.",
        "Dinah: With me?",
        "Edmund: What's wrong?",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Well, your bullpen is high, I know that from the exam that I did. And the lab work indicates that off severe calcium deficiency.",
        "Edmund: All right. But nothing life threatening, though?",
        "Dr. Sedwick: No, but left untreated it could be quite serious for dinah and the baby.",
        "Cassie: She'll have to take supplements and eat a calcium- rich diet?",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Exactly. And above everything else, you absolutely must avoid stress of any kind. Now, I'm going to write you a script for your supplements.",
        "Edmund: Thank you.",
        "Dinah: She's scaring me.",
        "Edmund: Hey, don't worry. Now that we know what problem is we just won't let it escalate, right, cassie?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, you know, when things go on ignored then they can get really bad. Now that we know, we can...",
        "Edmund: Cassie... cassie...",
        "Dinah: Edmund, don't go. Come on, please, don'T.",
        "Danny: So you sure you're okay with this? Quick trip for an even quicker divorce?",
        "Michelle: Yeah. I'm fine. You?",
        "Woman: You're in my seat.",
        "Danny: Oh, um... well, would you mind just take the aisle or the window so we can sit together?",
        "Woman: I would mind. I always reserve the middle seat. I feel more secure with people on either side of me.",
        "Danny: Okay.",
        "Woman: Let me guess, you two love birds are winging out to vegas to get married.",
        "Michelle: Nope. Divorced.",
        "Woman: Not the chumps i thought you were. Blanch davis, divorce attorney.",
        "Danny: Thanks, we don't need an attorney. We... it's a very friendly divorce. Blanch:( Laughs ) I've heard that one before. Friendly divorce. It's a contradiction in terms. Like \"jumbo shrimp.\" Any kids?",
        "Danny: No. I'm gonna try to get some sleep.",
        "Michelle: Okay.",
        "Blanch: Kids, property, all that can be negotiated. But there's one thing that can't be neatly divvied up: What's inside you, the history, the feelings, the passion. People think a piece of paper ends all that. They're the real chumps.",
        "Gus: Well, here goes.",
        "Alan: I think it's important for all of us to remember that tonight is about our family. I think it's time for all of us to forget and forgive.",
        "Alexandra: Well, I think we can all handle that. Can you, alan?",
        "Alan: I already have, alexandra.",
        "Olivia: Well, you're quite the forgiving soul, aren't you, alan?",
        "Beth: What exactly do you want us to forgive, alan? That gus threw each of us under the bus to say harley.",
        "Lizzie: Mom, does it even matter anymore?",
        "Alan: Ah, gus. Come in. Come in.",
        "Gus: I'm sorry I'm late.",
        "Alan: That's all right. We're just all very happy that you made it.",
        "Gus: I can see that. Someone want to hand me a blindfold and my last cigarette, maybe.",
        "Harley: Your job application is dated the day after I was convicted of phillip's murder. How interesting.",
        "Mallet: Is it? You know, I was working on this application long before I knew you'd be here. I heard this place was looking for someone to take charge with whip the prison into shape, and I thought why not me? I could always use a challenge.",
        "Harley: My ex-husband just happens to show up to run the prison where I'm sent. Uh-uh. I am sorry. I do not believe this is a coincidence.",
        "Mallet: Then what do you call it, hmm? Fate?",
        "Harley: I say you're here for me and that makes me wonder why.",
        "Mallet: Well, what can I say? I'm here; you're here. Deal with it. You know, harley, with good behavior you're up for parole in 15 years. It could be a lot worse.",
        "Harley: 15 years.",
        "Mallet: Yeah. Listen, I wish there was something I could...",
        "Harley: There's nothing you can do and I have work I have to do, right? The sooner I finish up, the sooner I can get back to my cell. That's good behavior isn't it, warden? Oh, and by the way, if you think about it, maybe you want to get a painter up here and update your door. That is if you're planning on sticking around.",
        "Mallet: Oh, I'm here for as long as it takes.",
        "Harley: To do what?",
        "Mallet: To finish what i started-- my job, I mean.",
        "Gus: Is one of you the killer? Are you standing here looking at me knowing that you're the reason harley's in jail?",
        "Alan: Gus, this is a welcoming committee, not a firing squad.",
        "Gus: Well, thank you for that big al-- uh, dad.",
        "Alan: Ladies?",
        "Alexandra: Welcome home, gus. It's nice to have you here.",
        "Gus: Thank you, alexandra. And it makes me, you know, happy to think that perhaps we can all just get along.",
        "Alan: By this time tomorrow gus will have finished his first full day back at spaulding and i can't help but think it's a harbinger of great things to come for the company and our family.",
        "Lizzie: If you say so.",
        "Alan: What was that?",
        "Lizzie: I was just saying that this is the biggest joke of a meal I've ever had in this house.",
        "Alexandra: All right, lizzie. We have all made mistakes here. I think it's important right now we help forgive and just move on.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, but I don't like pretending, pretending that we actually like each other and that we're a normal family.",
        "Alan: It is family, and that's all that counts, lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Family? Okay, gus tore me to shreds on the stand and you? You tried to punish him for months. Olivia hates everyone at this table. And that's a family? And you know what? At the end of the day, dad is still gone.",
        "Alan: I know, elizabeth.",
        "Lizzie: So why are you here? Why do you even want him here? Or her.",
        "Alan: Because gus is a spaulding and so is emma. Flesh and blood. That will always trump everything else.",
        "Gus: Well now wait. Dad, dad, almost everything else. Lizzie's got a point. You know, there was a point that I was after each and every person in this room. And so here's what we should do. Everybody should just put down their forks and pick up their knives and go ahead and here i am. Just take a stab at me.",
        "Edmund: What did you say to her, dinah?",
        "Dinah: About what?",
        "Edmund: About tonight? Somehow she has the impression that I manufactured this medical scare in order to lure her back into my clutches. Imagine that.",
        "Dinah: Maybe she sensed something. I'm sure she has women's intuition.",
        "Edmund: Really? What did you say to her?",
        "Dinah: I barely talked to her about you.",
        "Edmund: And when you did, what did you say?",
        "Dinah: I told her that you were worried about the baby, okay? That that you overreacted most likely and that you wanted me to get in here probably much sooner than I needed to be, that's all. Okay? I swear. Oh, my gosh. I genuinely thought something might be wrong with me. I thought the doctor was going to say something was wrong with me.",
        "Ross: Cassie. I got a message that dinah was brought here with an emergency?",
        "Cassie: It's all right. It's all right. She's basically and okay and the baby is fine.",
        "Ross: Basically okay?",
        "Cassie: There was a minor complication, ross, okay?",
        "Ross: Is she in there?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. She's in there recovering.",
        "Edmund: It's all right, dinah. It's going to be all right.",
        "Cassie: ( Sighs )",
        "Edmund: Quite a night.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. You know, I just can't get used to the idea that my peace of mind depends on dinah. When you called me tonight and told me there was something wrong with the baby...",
        "Edmund: I know.",
        "Cassie: Do you know, edmund?",
        "Edmund: The baby's going to be fine, cassie. It's going to be fine. What happened earlier at the beacon?",
        "Cassie: I told you I wasn't ready to see you yet.",
        "Edmund: I held you in my arms I looked in your eyes and you were ready to be with me again. Then the next thing I know you were off somewhere with jeffrey o'neill. Why? Did he say something to you?",
        "Cassie: No, he didn't say something. He didn'T. When you left and you went upstairs, I was confused, okay? I needed to figure out how I was feeling.",
        "Edmund: And you needed jeffrey o'neill to help you do that?",
        "Cassie: I went for a ride with jeffrey, nothing happened and I wasn't running away. Jeffrey:.",
        "Edmund: Well, you did run, cassie. You did. And you ran not because you stopped loving me. You ran because you still do.",
        "Danny: Yeah, baby. Nice. Very nice.",
        "Michelle: Wow.",
        "Danny: Got the pink bows.",
        "Michelle: Remind me why we never got married in a place like this.",
        "Danny: Well, we came close a couple summers ago. Remember that chapel we found? This place makes that look like the westminster abbey. What do we have here? ( \"Wedding march\" playing ). Uh-huh. Classy.",
        "Danny: How about this one?",
        "Michelle: Don'T. Don'T. It would be weird to get married like this.",
        "Judge: I thought I heard somebody out here. You the folks that booked the no- hassle divorce?",
        "Danny: Yes, we are.",
        "Judge: All right. We'll get you two split up in a jiffy.",
        "Gus: So, let's start with anybody. Somebody. Beth, how about you? Don't hold back. You know I hurt you, we both know it. Go ahead. Now's your chance to say it.",
        "Beth: All right. You hurt me.",
        "Beth: You didn't just put her on the stand. You tortured her. You dug at all of her sore spots you were totally willing to sacrifice my daughter to save harley.",
        "Gus: That's absolutely tr. Just like you. Like you were willing to leave with phillip just to protect your children, forget about the rest of them. We do stuff like that out of love. I understand that. So we're not different, you and me. I'm just human, like you.",
        "Lizzie: Was that supposed to be an apology to make everything think I killed my own father?",
        "Gus: Yes, that's what that was. That was an apology. I'm sorry. I really am sorry. I mean, you know, come on. I couldn't see it back then. Harley saw it. She tried to make me see it. All I could see in my mind, you guys, was harley going to prison. That's it. Love is blind. Or it makes you go blind or whatever. But lizzie I'm no different than you, okay? Wouldn't you do anything you could in this world just to get your father back? Anything at all?",
        "Alexandra: Gus, you really don't have to do this.",
        "Gus: You too, alexandra. Nobody knows better than you. Crossing that line for love. Olivia? You did everything you could to trash harley's trial, didn't you? I mean, why'd you do that in to save your marriage or just keep your life intact? And I hated it. I hated when what you did. But that's what we do. We do anything for love, you know, but I understand it. Do I understand what you did? Absolutely. Absolutely. And, dad, you had said something at the grave site. Do you remember?",
        "Alan: What was that?",
        "Gus: You had said \"you can't always save the people that you love the most, but you don't have to stop loving them.\" Do you remember that?",
        "Alan: Yes.",
        "Gus: Right. Well, that's how I feel about harley... felt. Look, I'm not stupid, okay? Harley's gone. This is my family. This is how I feel about my family. You're my future. I just need a chance to prove it to you all. That I have a place here under this roof with all of you.",
        "Mallet: Thanks for helping me do this.",
        "Harley: Yeah, well, you know, it's part of the job. It's better than being banished down to the laundry room. Why are you... why don't you just put one there and put the other one over there?",
        "Mallet: ( Laughs )",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Mallet: Nothing. Nothing, some things never change.",
        "Harley: Excuse me?",
        "Mallet: What? You have to have it your way. Maybe I like the trophy here.",
        "Harley: Then put the trophy there. It's your office, make it look hideous, I don't care.",
        "Mallet: We're in a prison.",
        "Harley: Yeah, like I hadn't noticed.",
        "Mallet: Here we go.",
        "Harley: Here we go what? What? What?",
        "Mallet: You have to have it your way or you get snarky and personal.",
        "Harley: I do not get personal you big dumb... I don't do that anymore, okay? In case you haven't noticed, things have changed.",
        "Mallet: Hmm. Maybe not.",
        "Harley: Okay. What is that? I mean, what is that supposed to mean? What is this? What do you think, we're going to set up our own cozy little love den in maximum security? Oh, yeah, we missed valentine's day but, hey, we've got the next 15 of them at least to look forward to, right? Maybe we can make some little heart cutouts with our paper. Oh, that's right, I'm not allowed to use scissors.",
        "Mallet: Are you done?",
        "Harley: No, I'm just getting started. You know what? You could come to my cell after lights out. Maybe you could save me a piece of lunch meat at our anniversary. It will be nifty. It will be like every girl's fantasy.",
        "Mallet: Harley, just shut up. Just shut up. You just don't get it, too do you? I'm here to help you.",
        "Harley: And I don't want you-- you -- to help me, okay? Yes, we have history, okay.",
        "Mallet: Our history doesn't matter. Okay? Whatever it means or meant out there is irrelevant. In this place there is no past. The only thing we have is right now. And how many more right nows you have before you get out of here. So let's face it, harley. Whether you like it or not, I'm your present and your future. Coming up on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Harley: I need you to help me again. Please go tell the guard that i don't want any visitors.",
        "Lena: Even him?",
        "Harley: Especially him.",
        "Cassie: You are concerned that dinah is going to use this baby for her own agenda. And let me tell you, I'm concerned about that, too, but it's not going to happen because I'm watching her like a hawk.",
        "Ross: Were you watching when she fell in love with your husband?",
        "Alan: I don't think gus is asking too much.",
        "Beth: He's asking for us to trust him.",
        "Gus: Yeah. That's basically it. Just shot. Olivia?",
        "Gus: I know what it feels like to be desperate and angry and to do things that you normally wouldn't do under other circumstances.",
        "Lizzie: You're like that all the time.",
        "Olivia: I've been more like that lately. All right? I thought my future was with bill, but things change. You either change with them or die. I think we're all proof of that. Yeah, I think we should give him some compassion. He's only trying to do now what we've already done.",
        "Alexandra: Well, now, we all know gus has made his mistakes which, in a way, proves to me that he's absolutely a member of this family. Welcome.",
        "Gus: Thanks, auntie.",
        "Alan: Beth?",
        "Beth: Is this that important to you?",
        "Alan: I've already lost one son. I don't want to lose another.",
        "Beth: Okay. I guess that we do the best that we can and, more importantly, we move forward.",
        "Alan: And elizabeth?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, sure. I mean, I guess things can't get any worse so gus and olivia, welcome home.",
        "Beth: Excuse me.",
        "Alan: Well, I guess that went about as well as can be expected.",
        "Gus: Dad, don't worry about it. All families are like this, okay? I'll see you at the office first thing.",
        "Gus: Dad, don't worry about it. All families are like this, okay? We'll pick this up tomorrow, I'll see you at the office first thing.",
        "Olivia: Taking a breather between shows? It was a great performance. And I mean that. I mean that as a compliment. Sincere or not, you have scoredr major points with alan tonight.",
        "Gus: Maybe you're talking about yourself. Is that why you backed me up, so you could score a few points for yourself?",
        "Olivia: Well, I'm just very aware of my audience. As are you.",
        "Gus: Olivia, I'm just trying to close one chapter of my life, move on to the next. See you around.",
        "Cassie: I never stopped loving you, edmund. But love for you justifies anything: Lying, threats, violence, and I don't want that in my life anymore.",
        "Edmund: Neither do I. Neither do I, cassie. Let me prove it to you. I tried to prove it to you earlier tonight. Just give me chance. Just say yes.",
        "Ross: Dinah, don't you see why this is going? You're moving into cassie's farmhouse, the very house that you once shared with hart.",
        "Dinah: Do you think that's what I want?",
        "Ross: No, I don't think it's all you want and that's what I'm afraid of. Now, you tell me, what's going to happen in eight months.",
        "Dinah: I have a baby.",
        "Ross: No, cassie and edmund are going to have the baby. What you're going to do is go through labor, you're going to take the child, hand it to the proud parents who say \"thank you very much\" and off you go. Where do you go? Off into the sunset?",
        "Dinah: Sort of, yeah. Daddy, I signed a legal agreement.",
        "Ross: A legal agreement? When have you ever cared what the law said? Dinah, you're delusional. You're living in a fantasy world.",
        "Dinah: I am not. I am not. You just said it. Cassie had me come into that farmhouse, she is taking care of me. That is the truth. That is real. Edmund is devoted to me and our baby.",
        "Ross: It's cassie's baby and edmund is her husband.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, for now.",
        "Ross: You're planning to take her place, right? Right, dinah?",
        "Dinah: No, I am not. Daddy, stop.",
        "Ross: You're going to take her baby, take her man, take her farm, you're going to take her entire life like you have always wanted to do. That is the plan, isn't it dinah.",
        "Dinah: I have to stay calm. I am not!",
        "Edmund: Ross, stop it. Let go of her.",
        "Judge: Of course, if you're looking for one final romp, this room doubles as the honeymoon suite and we rent it by the hour.",
        "Danny: No, thanks. We just want to sign the paperwork.",
        "Judge: All right, then, if you here in that big a rush.",
        "Michelle: We have a son waiting for us back home.",
        "Danny: We kind of want to get it rolling, you know what I'm saying? Thank you.",
        "Judge: Okay. First is the music. You can pick any theme you want.",
        "Michelle: Oh, a theme divorce huh? No, no, no thank you.",
        "Judge: Divorce doesn't have to be painful. It can be fun if you let it.",
        "Danny: Fun?",
        "Judge: Turning the page. A new chapter. No different than marriage, really.",
        "Michelle: Well, it feels a little different so...",
        "Judge: Depends on how you look at it. Tell you what, I'm going to finish your paperwork and my oyster stew. Now, you just pick a theme. Just trust me. You'll be glad you did. There you go. Have fun.",
        "Danny: How about we just sign the papers? Isn't there free booze around here? Shouldn't there be free booze?",
        "Michelle: Well, I think i found the perfect music.",
        "Danny: Yeah?",
        "Michelle: \"Breaking up is hard to do.\"",
        "Mallet: So glad we had this talk.",
        "Harley: Yeah, well, it's important to make the warden happy.",
        "Mallet: Hey, do we understand each other or not?",
        "Harley: Yes. You'll be my biggest big house booster as long as I know my place.",
        "Mallet: Yes and your place is a four-by-eight foot cell. And it can be livable or it can be hell. It's your choice. By the way, stay awake tonight, I may need you to do some more office work.",
        "Harley: But it's almost lights out.",
        "Mallet: You work for me; you're on my time.",
        "Lena: What'd you do to tick him off?",
        "Harley: I married him.",
        "Lena: You do work fast.",
        "Harley: That was a long time ago, okay? And, hey, I didn't say anything to you and you didn't hear me say anything, okay?",
        "Lena: Your secret is safe with me. Wow! I've always wanted to say that.",
        "Harley: I'm glad I could make you happy, lena.",
        "Lena: Hey, come on. Remember, I'm the one who got you out of trouble earlier today.",
        "Harley: I know. I remember and I appreciate it. There's something about you that makes me want to trust you.",
        "Lena: You know, I get that a lot. Especially considering I'm not trustworthy.",
        "Harley: ( Laughs )",
        "Lena: Okay, come on. What's the deal between you and this man? You can count on me. I'm a sucker for a good love story.",
        "Harley: What would you call a love story that turned into a horror film.",
        "Lena: Come on, there's always the sequel.",
        "Harley: What do you mean?",
        "Lena: I see sparks between you and the warden.",
        "Harley: No, no. No. No, no, no. What we had was over a long time ago. Over, capital \"o\".",
        "Lena: Over. Is it over with, you know, whatever his name is? Him? Hmm?",
        "Harley: Where did you get this?",
        "Lena: Under your mattress. Let me give you a little tip, sweetheart. Crummy place to hide stuff.",
        "Gus: I told you I've got... I've got special permission from the warden. Come on now, I'm allowed to speak to prisoner, cooper.",
        "Lena: You know the guy you don't care anything about? He's here.",
        "Guard: Hold it right there.",
        "Gus: How many times do I have to tell you, I have special clearance.",
        "Guard: I don't care what kind of clearance.",
        "Harley: I need you help me again. Please tell the guard that i don't want any visitors.",
        "Lena: Even him?",
        "Harley: Especially him. Please , lena, please.",
        "Lena: No. No. No. You have to take my advice here. I a man who looks like that, comes here, wants to see you, just don't pass on that. That opportunity doesn't come along everyday.",
        "Harley: Right.",
        "Lena: Right.",
        "Harley: Well maybe I... maybe I should just visit with him for a while to make sure he's okay.",
        "Gus: Ask him. You ask him, I'll wait for you. She's right through that door.",
        "Guard: I have to get say so from the warden, buddy.",
        "Gus: Cooper! Hey, coop! Coop!",
        "Alan: Olivia, here you are. I want to thank you.",
        "Olivia: For what?",
        "Alan: For standing up for gus in there.",
        "Olivia: Oh. Look, you've been amazing at welcoming emma and me back into the family and I thought the least I could do to reciprocate would be to reach out to your son. Honestly, though, I've got to work with the guy.",
        "Alan: Very diplomatic and very, very appreciated.",
        "Beth: You know how unsettled things have been around here.",
        "Lizzie: Unsettled? Maybe because everybody hates each other.",
        "Beth: That's not true.",
        "Alexandra: No. Not completely. Remember what your grandfather always says.",
        "Lizzie: Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. But aunt alex, I think the god father said that first.",
        "Alexandra: Coup mrs. God father.",
        "Beth: And you know what else your granddad says 1234? He says if you put two piranhas in the same tank, there's a good chance they'll eat each other. ( Laughter )",
        "Olivia: Did I mess the bunch line? Let me guess, I am the punch line.",
        "Alexandra: No. Well, half.",
        "Olivia: News flash, ladies: I have something to tell you. The joke's on you, too. Only it's quite not so funny. Not if you value your freedom.",
        "Danny: Michelle, come on. Put that stuff away. It's not a joke. I mean, our marriage was real. It meant something.",
        "Michelle: Every time.",
        "Danny: It's just... let's not end it like this. Go ahead, tell me what I stick in a mud I am.",
        "Michelle: You know, I feel exactly the way you do, danny. We took vows, we exchanged rings we... we looked into each other's eyes and promised... should be.",
        "Edmund: Comforting your daughter, ross?",
        "Ross: At least I'm not using her, which is what you're doing. But then again, you would use anyone or anything if you thought it would keep you with cassie.",
        "Dinah: Why are you doing this to us, daddy?",
        "Cassie: Ross, dr. Sedwick said....",
        "Ross: I know what dr. Sedwick said. Dinah has to avoid stress and, my, isn't that a convenient prescription because nobody is allowed to tell her what a hideous mess she's getting into. And god forbid nobody can criticize her newfound protector. In fact, nobody can say anything to her, even if it's for her own good.",
        "Edmund: She needs protection if this is your level of trust in her. Dinah's carrying our baby. It's a hugely generous act on her part. If you can't see that, you're the one who needs to see a doctor.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Ross, dinah and the baby have had enough for one night. Please, let's go. Look, ross, I know that you are concerned that dinah is going to use this baby for her own agenda and let me tell you, I'm concerned about that, too. But it's not going to happen because I'm watching her like a hawk.",
        "Ross: Were you watching when she fell in love with your husband?",
        "Cassie: Ross, I know dinah is fixated with my life, but that doesn't mean she's in love with edmund.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, she is. It's as plain as day.",
        "Cassie: Why would you say this?",
        "Edmund: Because she said it to bill. And I can see it in the way that she looks at him.",
        "Cassie: Fine. Okay. Let's say that this is true. It's just a fantasy. Doesn't mean anything.",
        "Edmund: Maybe. But edmund rescued dinah from tz%rplane when I tried to send her to her mother. He took her to the farmhouse to stay with him. Every action, every word out of his mouth just reinforces dinah's fantasy.",
        "Cassie: He doesn't love her, ross. Look, edmund has his faults, okay? And he has his secrets, but the one thing I know, that I am sure of is his love for me.",
        "Edmund: Just like hart's love. And look what happened there. My daughter is a disturbed young woman. And I'm her father. The blinders are off. And what I see is an unmitigated disaster just waiting to happen.",
        "Cassie: What am I supposed to do? Force her to end the pregnancy?",
        "Ross: I am not going to stay out of this. I'll take measures to protect you and dinah whether you approve or not. I will make that decision.",
        "Edmund: She's exhausted. We need to take her home.",
        "Cassie: Fine. I will take it from here.\u00d1i you ready?",
        "Dinah: Uh-huh.",
        "Cassie: Come on.",
        "Edmund: Sweetheart. Good night.",
        "Dinah: Good night.",
        "Edmund: Mr. Mayor.",
        "Ross: Hi, it's me. I hope it's not too late. Good. Where are you? Boston? Listen, you have to take the first available flight to springfield. I need you here, vanessa.",
        "Danny: I think the theme of this divorce, if we have to pick one, should be \"danny and michelle.\"",
        "Michelle: We're not exactly a celebrity breakup couple.",
        "Danny: Well, that's good. We fell in love, got married a couple times, have an amazing kid, went through a lot together some of it not so good. Most of it really good. And through it all they managed to stay friends.",
        "Michelle: Friends. Is that what we are now?",
        "Danny: Hey, how were those oysters?",
        "Judge: Did you guys pick a theme yet?",
        "Michelle: Yes, we did.",
        "Judge: Good for you. Oh. Oh.",
        "Danny: Are you all right?",
        "Michelle: Are you all right?",
        "Judge: How about those oysters? If you eat one that's already open, is that good or bad?",
        "Danny: Was it opened before it was cooked?",
        "Judge: Yeah.",
        "Michelle: That's bad. I think he's having an allergic on top of food poisons. I think he's going to be sick as a dog until morning.",
        "Danny: Morning, huh?",
        "Michelle: Yeah. I think I know what our theme for our divorce should be: \"Not so fast.\"",
        "Beth: Okay, olivia, you have our attention. What's the drama?",
        "Olivia: You don't know?",
        "Alexandra: Well, enlighten us please.",
        "Olivia: What did you think of that show tonight?",
        "Lizzie: What will you talking about?",
        "Olivia: Don't play cute with me. We all know what's going on, except alan. He's too close to gus to see it.",
        "Lizzie: It?",
        "Olivia: The only reason gus came back to spaulding was to make sure he pinned phillip's murder on one of us here.",
        "Alexandra: Ah, yes, pure paranoia. Do you have something to hide, olivia?",
        "Olivia: Do you think he's given up on harley, that he's going to stop investigating this case?",
        "Beth: No.",
        "Olivia: You've been to prison alexandra. You didn't like it very much but gus wouldn't hesitate to send you there if it gets harley out. That goes for the rest of us, too. I suggest we keep a very close eye on him together.",
        "Gus: Whoa. All right. Come on, brisco. Look, I'm not going to lie to you, even though I lied you-to- you earlier and you probably don't believe me. The warden didn't exactly give me special permission or anything, okay?",
        "Mallet: You don't say?",
        "Gus: Hey, how you doing, warden?",
        "Harley: Well, you know, it's probably better that I... i didn't see him. It would have been a mistake. He's my ex-lawyer. Probably was here to give me a bill or something.",
        "Lena: Right. Bill. Probably. I'll be right back.",
        "Lena: Hello, it's me. Lena. Yeah... yeah, I know. I'm not supposed to call you. You're going to call me, I know that. But listen, I just want to make sure that you're living up to your end of the bargain because I know I'm living up to mine. Yeah. Yeah, I... I have something to tell you.",
        "Alan: All right. I'm listening.",
        "Lena: Okay. I... I have news about my little roommate.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Danny: Oh, what the hell?",
        "Lena: Mr. Spaulding, I don't have much time. You set me up as harley cooper's roommate and you asked me to watch every move she made. I'm telling you, you need to get over here right now.",
        "Harley: Hey, roomy. Got something you want to say to me?"
