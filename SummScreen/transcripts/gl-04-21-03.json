Richard tells Cassie it's time to let him go and move on with her life. Cassie and Richard talk about their life together. Richard leaves and Cassie tries to follow him, opening the door to find a stunned Edmund. Cassie tells Edmund about the dream and he asks if he can talk to her. Since she can't sleep, she tells him to come in. She leaves to get a robe. Edmund tells Cassie that the money he used for the memorial was given to him unwillingly and that the money really wasn't his. This angers Cassie and she calls him a jerk. Edmund makes Cassie laugh and leaves. Ross advises Phillip not to lose sight of himself and what he wants while trying to find Alan. Olivia and Phillip discuss the possibility of him returning to the company in a more permanent fashion. Olivia says that's fine, but they are together come what may.

        "Cassie: Richard?",
        "Richard: I looked in on the children. The boys are getting so big. And Tammy, she's... Well, she's looking more and more like her mother every day. So beautiful.",
        "Cassie: You're here. Richard.",
        "Richard: We don't have much time.",
        "Cassie: Please don't go. I can't say good-bye to you again. So much has happened. I made so many mistakes, Richard, before the accident.",
        "Richard: Shh. Cassie, listen to me. I was the one who failed you.",
        "Cassie: No. Never.",
        "Richard: But I can make up for it now, by saying good-bye. Cassie, it's time for you to let me go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: We've hired our own detectives and Frank's got the department out in force, but it's like Alan has dropped off the face of the earth.",
        "Ross: And how are you holding up?",
        "Phillip: I just can't believe that I didn't see this coming sooner. I keep asking myself, if I were Alan, where would I be? And then I remember, he's not Alan. He's not the Alan that I know.",
        "Ross: So in the absence of the real Alan Spaulding, you stepped in.",
        "Phillip: Excuse me?",
        "Ross: I saw the press conference.",
        "Phillip: And?",
        "Ross: And... Good luck in finding Alan.",
        "Phillip: No, no. No. Obviously, you have something to say about me stepping in.",
        "Ross: As a matter of fact, I do. As your uncle, I am concerned about this turnaround of yours, okay? You had your life very much on track.",
        "Phillip: I'm still on track. I'm just taking a different train.",
        "Ross: I can understand your concern for Alan, but the company?",
        "Phillip: What was I supposed to do?",
        "Ross: Well, look for him, yes, of course. But in finding your father, don't lose yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Okay, maybe if I were to go back out and come in. Hi, honey.",
        "Gus: Hi, hi.",
        "Harley: I'm home.",
        "Gus: I know. Welcome home. Welcome home. That didn't hurt, did it?",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Gus: Is Rick outside still?",
        "Harley: Uh, no... Rick took off.",
        "Gus: Okay, all right. Do you want to sit down? Do you want to lie down?",
        "Harley: No, I've been lying down. I'm sick of lying down.",
        "Gus: Okay, well, I'll give you a little update, okay? Jude is over at the Bauer's and Zach's upstairs making a little welcome home banner for you.",
        "Harley: Oh, great. So I will go upstairs and I will surprise Zach. Speaking of surprises...",
        "Gus: Well, I'll explain everything to you a little later, okay?",
        "Harley: Okay.",
        "Gus: Just not right now in front of A-l-a-n.",
        "Alan: Alan. That's me.",
        "Gus: Yes, that's very good. That's good. This is Harley.",
        "Alan: Harley. You must be Gus' girlfriend. He really likes you. I'm Alan Spaulding.",
        "Harley: Yes, Alan, I know who you are, for a long time.",
        "Gus: He doesn't like it when people know who he is. He doesn't like that. She's very good. She would never hurt you, okay?",
        "Alan: Look, I think I... I think I want to go upstairs and take a nap or something.",
        "Gus: Yeah, that's a good idea.",
        "Alan: Make sure you wake me up to dress for dinner, okay?",
        "Gus: But dinner was pizza, remember?",
        "Alan: Oh, yeah, that's right. The works, with extra cheese and... (Laughs) Okay.",
        "Gus: Go ahead. Why don't you sit down, just take a couple of deep breaths and I promise you I'll come down and explain everything. Hold on, Alan. (Cell phone ringing)",
        "Harley: It's probably Alexandra wanting to sleep over, too. Hi, Frank. Yep, I got home okay. A little sore, yeah. Alan Spaulding disappeared from his competency hearing? No, I haven't heard anything about that. No, you can't come over. Because you're the one who instigated the whole I.A. thing with Gus in the first place. Bingo, I'm not over it. Yes, I know I am still your sister. I'm going. I'm going.",
        "Gus: Thank you. Thank you for not, you know, dragging Frank into this.",
        "Harley: Well, he's still in the doghouse for what he did to you.",
        "Gus: Well, he's going to have to build a little extra space for me in that doghouse.",
        "Harley: (Laughs) So I gather Alan is not just taking a nap upstairs.",
        "Gus: He's going to spend the night.",
        "Harley: Of course he is. Welcome home, Harley.",
        "Gus: Just take it easy, okay? Just put this on.",
        "Harley: So what exactly happened at the courthouse?",
        "Gus: Well, I caught the end of the competency hearing. He was even more agitated then than he is now.",
        "Harley: That was a public hearing?",
        "Gus: No. Well, it was private-- Spaulding's only-- but I slipped in.",
        "Harley: Why not? You are one of them.",
        "Gus: Well, anyway, he was... They were bringing up the stalking charges. They were dropped, but he was declared incompetent.",
        "Harley: So he got off?",
        "Gus: Well, I don't know. Did you take a look at him? You see what kind of shape he's in?",
        "Harley: You're really buying his act?",
        "Gus: Yeah. I've got to tell you, yes, I am. But the Lewis's aren't. And then when the Spaulding family moved to have Alan just get home care, there was pandemonium, and he just slipped out the door.",
        "Harley: And you...?",
        "Gus: I tracked him down. You know where he went? He went to the bridge. He was going to jump off. He lost it.",
        "Harley: He's lost it? And he is upstairs with my child?",
        "Gus: No, no, no. He would never hurt Zach. He'd never hurt anybody. The guy was just terrified to go home. Terrified.",
        "Harley: None of this makes any sense to me, okay? Did you tell him?",
        "Gus: Tell him what?",
        "Harley: What do you mean, \"What?\" That you're his son.",
        "Gus: No.",
        "Harley: Do you want to?",
        "Gus: It doesn't matter what I... He wouldn't get it now, anyway.",
        "Harley: Okay. If he is as out of it as you truly believe he is, why now? Why? What could possibly happen to make him go over the deep end?",
        "Gus: It's not what, it's who. Alexandra did this to him, and for all I know, Phillip is behind this whole thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Do you know how much I missed you?",
        "Richard: I've missed you, too. Cassie, did you hear me? It's time. You have to let me go.",
        "Cassie: I can't. Richard, if I don't have your love, then I have nothing.",
        "Richard: Nonsense. You have so much. And you're so strong, stronger than you know.",
        "Cassie: With you, I didn't have to be. You saved me. You gave me so much. You gave me a home and you gave me a life. I didn't know how to share things. I didn't know how to share myself. You taught me so much. You taught me how to love and you taught me how to be loved.",
        "Richard: I made so many mistakes. I was just trying to protect you. I knew you had to fight your whole life and I didn't want you to have to fight anymore.",
        "Cassie: I know.",
        "Richard: But I should have... I should have let you. I should have let you in. I should have let you fight with me, side by side.",
        "Cassie: We did, so many times.",
        "Richard: Yes, we did. But in the end, when things mattered, I was trying to protect you rather than including you, and I'm sorry. I'm so sorry for that. I guess I was just caught up in trying to be your prince instead of being your husband. I should have been a better husband. Just as I should have been a better brother, a more compassionate brother to Edmund.",
        "Cassie: He doesn't deserve your regret. He would tell you that.",
        "Richard: I was the chosen one, Cassie. I had everything handed to me. It's easy when you have everything handed to you. Edmund never had anything, anything of his own, anything that he really wanted.",
        "Cassie: He's fine. He is. He's trying to live up to you. Not that he ever could. Please stay. Please.",
        "Richard: You know I can't. You have so much to look forward to. You just have to take the next step.",
        "Cassie: I can't. Not without you.",
        "Richard: You have to. Neither one of us can have any peace if you keep holding on. Let me be the keeper of the flame, the keeper of our love. You have to make room in your heart for other things now.",
        "Cassie: I can't.",
        "Richard: I'm taking up too much space in there. Good-bye, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Richard!",
        "Richard: I love you so much, but you have to let me go now.",
        "Edmund: Cassie?",
        "Cassie: Richard... Richard... He was here. Richard was here, you know. He would still be here if you didn't show up, Edmund. I know it was a dream, okay? I know it that was a dream, but it was so... It was so real.",
        "Edmund: I'm sorry.",
        "Cassie: I thought I could get him to stay. He was going on and on about all these mistakes that he made before the accident. I kept trying to tell him stop, but he just wouldn't listen to me.",
        "Edmund: You're lucky. I've never had a dream about him. I'd like to see him again, work out a few things.",
        "Cassie: He talked about you. He said that he wished that he... That you... That he could have done things different, so you two would be closer and then you would have had a better life.",
        "Edmund: It's Richard taking responsibility. Cassie, I wish I knew what to say to make you feel better, but I'm not good at this.",
        "Cassie: He wants me to do something that I can't do.",
        "Edmund: What's that?",
        "Cassie: He gave me his blessing. He wants me to move on.",
        "Edmund: And you think you can't?",
        "Cassie: He says that he sees this future for me without him. That he wants me to be some woman who can go through a day without thinking of him. Some woman who has a place in her heart for someone else. I can't be her.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, there's something I need to say to you, and, well, I was wondering if I could stay for a few minutes.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. I'm not going to be able to go back to sleep. I'm going to get a robe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: Oh, come on. Now, you have to know that I am not thrilled about plunging back into Spaulding, but I didn't feel like I had much of a choice.",
        "Ross: Oh, I think you did. And I don't want to see you get sucked into something that doesn't make you happy. It's never made you happy, Phillip.",
        "Phillip: But it's not just about me. I've got my kids to think about. This is their legacy, too.",
        "Ross: And you were going to leave them a legacy far more valuable than a stock portfolio. You were going to give them your time, right?",
        "Phillip: I'm not abandoning them. I'm just keeping the family from going under. And you know what, Ross? Who the hell knows? Maybe at this point in my life, I can actually be happy running the company, if I could do it my way.",
        "Ross: I hope you can pull that off.",
        "Phillip: Well, we'll see.",
        "Ross: But never, never forget what happened to Alan. I saw it firsthand. I was working for him at the time. He made this company his life. It consumed him, and look what's happened.",
        "Phillip: Ross? (Phone ringing) I'm not Alan. Excuse me. Hello. Evie. Yeah. I'll just be a second, Ross. Um, no. No word yet on my father. Listen, I need you to set me up a meeting with all the department heads. As soon as possible. Right. Oh, don't worry. I'll let you know as soon as I hear anything, but don't worry. In the meantime, the company is not going to suffer. Okay. All right. Let me know when you get that meeting scheduled. Thanks. Sorry. Where were we?",
        "Ross: You were saying you weren't Alan.",
        "Phillip: I'm not.",
        "Ross: Mm-hmm. I'm sure that Alan didn't think he was Brandon, once upon a time.",
        "Phillip: Ouch. Okay. The truth?",
        "Ross: Please.",
        "Phillip: There has always been a part of me that wanted to take my shot at running this company and to do it my way-- to show Alan and to show Alex that it doesn't have to be their way, it can be done differently. It can be done better.",
        "Ross: And I understand how tempting that is, but there is a real chance that Alan will not resume his rightful place in the company. Now, are you willing to give up your independence and make Spaulding Enterprises your life, permanently?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Gus, if what you're saying is true, you cannot cure him. You know that? Any more than you could have taken that bullet out of me. The man needs professional help.",
        "Gus: Did you see him in the hospital? He was freaking out.",
        "Harley: Yes. Because he's claustrophobic. Because he was getting an M.R.I. That's not uncommon.",
        "Gus: I offered him a cup of tea, okay, and he saw a skull and crossbones. He said that any time he was eating or drinking, that's when he started to lose himself.",
        "Harley: So you think he's being drugged?",
        "Gus: Hallucinogenics, I would bet my last dollar on it.",
        "Harley: You know what? Alexandra's capable of a lot of things, but doing this?",
        "Gus: Coop, he was talking about lizard people.",
        "Harley: Oh, my God.",
        "Gus: He was talking about monsters. He was saying that she's the queen; Alex is the queen.",
        "Harley: Honey, is somebody putting something in your tea?",
        "Gus: No, no, just stick with me on this for a second, okay? If he is declared incompetent, he can't run the Spaulding corporation, right? That makes Alexandra a very happy woman.",
        "Harley: Okay, I don't doubt for a second that Alexandra would steal her brother blind. But she would do it in the family way, you know? Corporate raids, back-stabbing, blackmail. No matter how warped and twisted their relationship is, they still love each other.",
        "Gus: Yeah, well, I think she loves the corporation more. Okay? And what she's doing, it's not to advance herself, it is to advance Phillip. He is going to take over the company and keep her by his side.",
        "Harley: Okay, okay. Too late. Phillip has moved out of the house. He's left the company, all of it.",
        "Gus: Uh-huh. No. He's playing hokey-pokey with the family and the company. Did anybody even tell you that he held a press conference today? He didn't even talk about his father's disappearance once. All he talked about was keeping that corporation on its feet. Now what do you think of Phillip, huh?",
        "Harley: I don't know. I don't know what to think about any of this. It's like trying to put together a jigsaw puzzle when you don't have the box top to see what it should look like. Maybe you're the missing piece.",
        "Gus: Me?",
        "Harley: Yes. Because Alexandra knows that you are Alan's son and she has done everything in her power to cover that up. Maybe she's doing this to him to keep him from...",
        "Gus: Hey, Zacheroo.",
        "Alan: I think I'm a bit taller than you are. (Laughs)",
        "Harley: Oh, my little boy.",
        "Alan: Let me help you. You poor thing.",
        "Harley: Come to me. Give me a hug. Oh, my big boy! I missed you so much.",
        "Zach: I missed you too.",
        "Harley: You did?",
        "Alan: We've been upstairs working on your welcome home sign, and you got home a little early.",
        "Gus: Who was doing the drawing on the banner? Who did the drawing? He did it?",
        "Harley: Who is that? Grandpa Alan.",
        "Zach: Grandpa Alan.",
        "Harley: Yes. Yes, well, that sounds great. You know, why don't we go upstairs and you can show me that and I'll pretend to be surprised.",
        "Gus: Come here, Zach. Take this with you. No, just take this.",
        "Harley: Take it.",
        "Gus: I thought you were going to try to get a little sleep.",
        "Alan: I couldn't. Because now I know who you are. Yes, I remember you.",
        "Gus: You know who I am.",
        "Alan: I didn't like you much, did I?",
        "Gus: Well, I didn't like you very much, either, so I guess we're even.",
        "Alan: I know you're not one of the lizard people, because I've been watching and waiting for you to turn into one, and you haven't.",
        "Gus: And I never will. I promise.",
        "Alan: It seems I've been trusting the wrong people for a long time. The ones I like, turn out to be the scary ones. The ones I didn't like... Well, you're the only person I can trust. And I want to thank you for it. So, I'm going to buy you a company.",
        "Gus: (Laughs) All I did was loan you a pair of sweatpants.",
        "Alan: No, no, you did a lot more than that. You really helped me out, and well, if you don't want a company, maybe I'll buy you a baseball franchise and a Harley.",
        "Gus: Oh, I love baseball. I don't need anything, but thank you. And why would you buy me a Harley?",
        "Alan: Well, it's the pet name of your girlfriend.",
        "Gus: No, Alan, that's really her name. But I don't need anything. I'm fine, thanks.",
        "Alan: Well, you know, if you ever change your mind, the offer still stands, okay? Is this the kind of house you grew up in?",
        "Gus: For a little while. In Chicago.",
        "Alan: Oh. Are your parents still back in Chicago?",
        "Gus: No, my parents died a long time ago.",
        "Alan: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know. I don't know anything anymore.",
        "Gus: Yeah. Well, I'm sorry, too. Actually, I was adopted.",
        "Alan: Really? Because I have a son who was adopted.",
        "Gus: Yeah. I know. Yeah, Phillip was adopted.",
        "Alan: You know, Zach reminds me so much of Phillip when he was that age.",
        "Gus: That's because Phillip is Zach's father. He used to be married to Harley.",
        "Alan: Wow. Really?",
        "Gus: Mm-hmm. And I used to see you at the mansion all the time because you and Phillip, you wanted to keep Zach away from his mother, so...",
        "Alan: But Zach is so happy here.",
        "Gus: Yeah, he is.",
        "Alan: I get the feeling that I wasn't such a nice guy.",
        "Gus: It was complicated for you, you know?",
        "Alan: Yeah, but that shouldn't be complicated. I mean, parents and children should just love one another. I mean, nothing should stand in the way of that, don't you think?",
        "Gus: That's exactly what I think.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: You know, Ross, maybe this time it'll be the best of both, running the company. I'm not entering into this with any illusions, but you know, it's not the position itself that is the root of all evil. It doesn't have to be that way.",
        "Ross: I don't doubt you, I don't doubt your intentions and I think you could run the company wonderfully. And in spite of the harangue, I am in your corner.",
        "Phillip: I know that you are and I appreciate it. I know I have to be careful about the way I go back this time. I know that I have to remember why it felt so good to walk away.",
        "Ross: And I saw you just after you did that and you were never happier, so I just hope that whatever or whoever changed your mind is worth it.",
        "Olivia: Phillip? You have to do something. Holly is planning on leading the evening news with a piece on Alan. This is going to be a disaster for the company. Hi. Sorry. Maybe you can do something, because...",
        "Phillip: That's all right. I'll handle it.",
        "Olivia: Will you call her? Because she should be back by the station by now.",
        "Phillip: I'll take care of it. Don't worry about it. Ross, I'll be back in a minute.",
        "Olivia: Thanks. Sorry. I hope I wasn't interrupting something important.",
        "Ross: I was asking Phillip a question, that's all, and I believe I just got my answer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Do you really think this thing with Alan is such a good idea?",
        "Gus: I'll sit on the couch all night if you want me to, and watch him, or I'll take him to a hotel. Whatever makes you happy.",
        "Harley: It's not that. You are suspended. If Frank finds out about this, it's not going to look good for you.",
        "Gus: Look, the guy just needs time to get whatever is in his system out, that's making him like this, and then he can fight his own battles. He can fight for himself.",
        "Harley: It's so much easier for you to believe that he's been drugged than the alternative.",
        "Gus: Look, I'll admit I... I hate seeing him like this, but I wouldn't wish that on anybody, you know?",
        "Harley: He's not just anybody.",
        "Gus: I'll admit this version of him is better than the original, okay, but he is terrified. Can't you see that? That is real fear. That fear is coming from somewhere or someone. And if it's Alex doing this to him to keep him away from me, do you really think that Phillip would have a problem reaping those benefits? Do you?",
        "Harley: I find this so hard to believe. I mean, yes, Phillip has flaws, but he wouldn't drug or know about his own...",
        "Gus: Oh, he wouldn't do what? He wouldn't try to keep Zach away from you? He wouldn't try to break your heart? Please. The guy held a press conference today. He didn't even mention that his father's disappeared. If it was me, I'd be holding up a picture. I'd be, like, \"Hello, has anybody seen this man? Does this guy look familiar to you?\" I'd be trying to figure out how to put his face on the back of a milk carton. Come on. This guy's talking about keeping his company together? Keeping the company on its feet?",
        "Harley: He is not your father. At least, he's not your father the way Joe August was your father.",
        "Gus: I just can't help thinking to myself, you know, maybe things would be different for Alan, they would have turned out different if he'd had the right kind of son by his side all of this time.",
        "Harley: You know, honey, you look at him and you see this innocence. You know? And you feel like you want to take care of him. Even I look at him like this and my heart goes out to him a little. But that guy sleeping on the couch, whether its his own mind playing tricks with him or somebody else doing it to him, it's still Alan.",
        "Gus: What does that mean?",
        "Harley: It means don't fall in love with the stray puppy on the couch. It's temporary.",
        "Gus: I know that.",
        "Harley: Do you?",
        "Gus: I know that.",
        "Harley: Do you really? Because, you know, you're going to have to go through this all over again with the real Alan, and before you tell me that there's hope for him, let me just say this: You have to protect yourself. You have to watch your back, and if you won't do it, then I will, because I am not going to see you get your heart broken.",
        "Gus: Look, this is the chance I'm going to have to take, okay? When my dad... When Joe August died, I felt like I let him down, you know? I felt like there's something I could have done. I could have been... I should have been...",
        "Harley: Sweetie, you were a child. There was nothing you could have done.",
        "Gus: Okay. But I'm not a child now, okay? And there's plenty I can do for him. I can help him. I can. I can't turn my back on him and I won't.",

        "Cassie: Warm milk? Wow.",
        "Edmund: Amazing thing, room service.",
        "Cassie: Sorry it took me so long. Tammy's awake. I was telling her about the dream.",
        "Edmund: Good. Cassie, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring up the things I brought up and I upset you. I'm sorry.",
        "Cassie: Wait, Edmund. You were right. Everything you said, you were right.",
        "Edmund: But I upset you.",
        "Cassie: But you told me what I needed to hear. Everyone has been treating me with kid gloves, but you don't. I feel responsible for still being alive while he's gone. I feel guilty for moving on a little, even though I really haven't moved on at all. And even though I know he wants me to, I don't think I can do it. So there it is.",
        "Edmund: He didn't happen to tell you what he thinks I should do, did he?",
        "Cassie: He said that you've never really gotten what you wanted in your whole life. That's true, isn't it? Things are, you know... I mean, things are getting better for you. I mean, they're changing, right? And down the road, you're going to have things of your own.",
        "Edmund: Richard said that?",
        "Cassie: No, I said that. I mean, I know that I've gone back and forth on this fund-raiser thing, but you not only have my presence, you have my full support. You do.",
        "Edmund: Because of Richard? Because of the dream?",
        "Cassie: Maybe. And because I appreciate that you're trying to change. I mean, come on, the guy you used to be would never forgo sleep to talk me through a dream. He would never order me warm milk, that's for sure.",
        "Edmund: Well, you were upset.",
        "Cassie: He would never use his own money to honor Richard.",
        "Edmund: Ah, um...",
        "Cassie: Sorry. Way too many compliments in one evening. Okay.",
        "Edmund: No, no. That money... That money, Cassie, that I donated, that wasn't... That wasn't my money.",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Edmund: Well, it was my money, but it was just, it was... It was money that was given to me somewhat grudgingly, and well, I shouldn't have led you to believe that it was really my money.",
        "Cassie: Why did you?",
        "Edmund: Well, I needed you to go to the event.",
        "Cassie: So a few well-placed lies are fine?",
        "Edmund: Well, Cassie, it worked, didn't it? I mean, you felt obligated. You were even a bit impressed.",
        "Cassie: You are such a jerk, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: What, so my newfound honesty isn't going to go rewarded?",
        "Cassie: I could hurt you right now. Do you know that?",
        "Edmund: I have no doubt. I have no doubt. But you won't.",
        "Cassie: Why won't I?",
        "Edmund: Positive reinforcement. You want me to keep on telling the truth.",
        "Cassie: (Laughs)",
        "Edmund: You know, I think that may be the first... The first smile I've ever gotten from you.",
        "Cassie: I think you're right. I think you should go while you're ahead.",
        "Edmund: I think you're right.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. (Laughs)",
        "Edmund: I will call you with plans about the gala, all right?",
        "Cassie: The gala. Gala. You know, that's a really strange word. People don't usually say \"Gala.\"",
        "Edmund: Well, I guess we could always call it a picnic or a barbecue.",
        "Cassie: You know, in the dictionary right next to the word \"Snob\" is your picture.",
        "Edmund: Well, yours is right next to \"Self-righteous egalitarian.\"",
        "Cassie: If you're going to insult me, could you do it in English, please?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, that was mostly a compliment.",
        "Cassie: You're two for two. Get out of here.",

        "Phillip: Just routine?",
        "Olivia: Maybe a sonogram. I thought you might like to come.",
        "Phillip: Sure, yeah.",
        "Olivia: I figure, with all the bad stuff that's going on, maybe it would be nice to see a glimpse of the good. Have you eaten? Because I asked cook to prepare us something.",
        "Phillip: No, I'm okay. But, you know, you need to eat. I'll keep you company.",
        "Olivia: Okay. Good, let's eat.",
        "Phillip: Hang on a sec. There's something else I want to tell you. I've decided that I don't want to run Spaulding on an interim basis. I want to stay and do it right. What do you think?",
        "Olivia: What do I think? (Laughs) I think it's great! I was just telling Ross that I think we could have it all, and I do. I believe we can. More than anything, I just want to be with you, okay? I don't care where we are, if we're on a private island or in the middle of all this. I'm with you all the way. Okay?",

        "Harley: Well, obviously, this thing with Alan is important to you, keeping him safe. So it is... It is important to me, too.",
        "Gus: So you won't turn him in?",
        "Harley: Why don't we just sleep on things tonight, okay? Maybe we'll wake up in the morning and he'll be back to his old self.",
        "Gus: Thank you. I know you're doing this for me...",
        "Harley: Not just you.",
        "Gus: Oh, because Alan's getting to you, too, right?",
        "Harley: No. Zach is getting to me. I was upstairs looking at that poster that Alan helped him make. Well, apparently it's unusual for Alan to do that. Like, usually, I guess, he supervises playtime rather than participating. And Zach said, \"I got to do that with Grandpa!\" I mean he was so excited, you know? I just... I can't do anything to hurt his grandfather right now.",
        "Gus: You are such a good mom. You are such a good mommy.",
        "Harley: I know.",
        "Gus: You're good at almost everything. I'll tell you what, though. You've got to be exhausted. You're going to bed.",
        "Harley: Before I pass out?",
        "Gus: You're going to bed. You're going to get under those covers. I'll help you get into your pajamas. Okay?",
        "Harley: I look forward to that. But in a little while, okay, because I want to finish reading this book to Zach. We're dying to know if this rabbit gets out of the briar patch.",
        "Gus: Okay. Well, you tell me how that all turns out. Go on.",

        "Gus: I'm sure he doesn't hate you. It's just a misunderstanding.",
        "Alan: No, no. Sons can hate their fathers. I hated mine. You wouldn't hate yours, would you?",
        "Gus: No.",
        "Alan: It would be nice to have a son like you.",
        "Gus: (Whispers) But you do. I am your son.",

        "Gus: No. Checkers. Never chess.",
