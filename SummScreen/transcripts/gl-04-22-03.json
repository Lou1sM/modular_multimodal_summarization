        "Danny and Michelle met up with Tony and Marah at the Beacon, where Tony & Marah gladly accepted when they were asked to be Danny & Michelle's Best Man and Maid Of Honor at their wedding. As Marah and Michelle sat discussing wedding details, Tony & Danny went outside and discussed Danny's recent trip to New York. Tony was angry, at first, when he found out that Danny went behind his back to do this, but Danny explained that it's in everyone's best interests that he gave Salerno control of Carmen's \"businesses\" in exchange for Salerno leaving them all alone. After they rejoined Marah & Michelle, Marah was persuaded to design Michelle's wedding dress. Blake ran into Buzz at \"Olivia's\", and asked for his opinion on the way she was dressed. She told Buzz that she was having a job interview there, soon, and that she needed a challenge in her life right now. She also told him that she hadn't told Ross about any of this. After Blake left their table, Ross appeared and joined Buzz, asking Buzz for his opinion on Ross' new idea: that he & Blake buy the Jessop farm and raise their kids there. Buzz was caught in the middle, feeling uncomfortable.",
        "Marina saw Ben, briefly, at the museum just before he was all set to go to \"work\". When she attempted to tell him something important, he asked if it could wait until after he was through with work. After Ben left, Marina got nervous thinking about the thug who confronted her. She was about to search the old tunnel when Shayne arrived, scaring her out of her wits. Marina told him all about the thug and how the thug wanted his \"stuff\". Shayne went upstairs to look through a storage room for whatever the \"stuff\" might be, but downstairs, Marina was again accosted by the thug! After Marina asked the thug exactly what he was looking for, he told her not to play stupid. Shayne came up behind the thug and clobbered him over the head with a baseball bat, just as Tony & Marah returned home. After filling Tony & Marah in on the thug's request, Tony & Shayne convinced Marah & Marina not to call the police (for fear that Josh won't allow them to live there). Tony remarked that he knew the thug as \"Ernie\", and as Ernie began regaining consciousness, Tony hauled him into another room and told him to leave town, warning him not to ever set foot on the property again. Just as Ernie shuffled off, he smiled back at Tony and told him: \"Don Salerno sends his regards\". Ben met up with Ramona in her suite at the Beacon and the two engaged in sex once again. Afterwards, Ramona told Ben that he needs to learn a few things about sex, that he shouldn't be so \"hurried\", and after promising him that she'll be his tutor, the two had sex once more. Later, after guessing that Ben felt guilty about Marina, Ramona told him that he'll be better able to \"please\" Marina after his association with her. Ramona then told Ben that he needs to drive a better car and gave him a business card for one of the car dealerships her husband owns, promising to put a good word in for him.",
        "Josh expressed concern for his family's safety while Alan is still on the loose. Frank dropped in at the Lewis home and told Josh and Reva that Alan still hasn't been found. Reva told them she doesn't believe Alan's a threat. After Frank & Josh stepped outside to talk, Reva ducked out. She went to the Spaulding mansion and had a conversation with Alexandra. Reva told Alex she's not convinced that she's concerned for her brother's (Alan's) welfare. Later, Reva lifted up a glass ornament and after it sat in the palm of her hand, Reva received a \"vision\" of waves slapping against rocks or wood. Alexandra sensed Reva had a feeling about something, and when Reva filled her in about the \"vision\", a fearful Alexandra rushed off. Later, once Reva returned home, Josh wasn't too pleased, especially after she told him she'd been at the Spauldings. After telling Josh about her \"vision\", Frank called. He was at the Spauldings, and had just learned what Reva had told Alex. Frank told Josh that the police would be looking around the lake for any clues, and told Josh to try to keep Reva out of this. After the phone call, Reva told Josh that whatever's happened to Alan---Alexandra is definitely involved!"

        "Reva: Hey, no playing ball in the house, young man.",
        "Josh: Well, actually I was looking for the other young man at the house. You know, he sort of fell off of his practices while you were away. So... Hey, son. You got an early practice today?",
        "Reva: Hey, sweetie.",
        "Shayne: Hey. No it's spring break.",
        "Josh: Okay, well, you want to go out and throw the ball around a little bit?",
        "Shayne: No, I'm supposed to rest my arm today.",
        "Josh: Well, how about hitting? Pitchers hit, right?",
        "Shayne: I'm on vacation.",
        "Josh: Yeah, from school, but not from baseball.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, baseball's supposed to be a game. It's suppose to just be fun.",
        "Reva: Where are you going?",
        "Josh: Son...",
        "Shayne: I'm going to Marah's.",
        "Reva: Oh, okay. Have fun.",
        "Josh: Good-bye.",
        "Reva: Why are you so intent on him practicing?",
        "Josh: Because he should practice.",
        "Reva: Or is it that he should be somewhere where you can keep your eye on him? Like you won't let me go shopping.",
        "Josh: Reva, we don't know where Alan is right now. (Knock at the door) So, yes, I would like to keep all of you close, okay? Hey, Frank.",
        "Frank: Hey, Josh.",
        "Josh: Did you find him?",
        "Frank: No, I haven't. But he's out there somewhere.",

        "Alexandra: So no admissions overnight? No, I understand. Thank you, Dr. Grant.",
        "Lloyd: The morning papers, madam. I'm afraid Mr. Spaulding's disappearance is on page one in all of them.",
        "Alexandra: That's good.",
        "Lloyd: It is?",
        "Alexandra: Yes, if there's been admissions to hospitals overnight, no one seen him. Maybe now that it's in the paper, someone will spot him.",
        "Lloyd: You look tired.",
        "Alexandra: I really didn't sleep that well.",
        "Lloyd: Alexandra, what if Mr. Spaulding's never found?",
        "Alexandra: Don't even think that way.",
        "Lloyd: Yes, it would be horrible, but if he has... Disappeared in some sort of permanent way, he'd be out of the picture. Isn't that what you wanted?",
        "Alexandra: No! Alan is not an inconvenience. He is my brother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ben: Yeah, of course I'm planning to be there.",
        "Ramona: I'm just making sure that you don't have a date at the mall with your young friend.",
        "Ben: Don't make fun of Marina, all right?",
        "Ramona: Well, I wouldn't. I like the girl.",
        "Ben: I'm on my way. I'll see you shortly. Hey.",
        "Marina: Ha, you're doing the tie.",
        "Ben: Yeah.",
        "Marina: That means work, right?",
        "Ben: I'm sorry. Mrs. Hendon can be really demanding.",
        "Marina: Oh, yeah? So is that how she got the handkerchief I gave you? She demanded it? Or did you just give it to her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: I feel bad leaving Robbie overnight.",
        "Danny: Why? He loves staying with your dad. You know that.",
        "Michelle: I know, I know. But I guess I am feeling guilty for having so much fun.",
        "Danny: Well, you better get used to it.",
        "Michelle: Well, I might need a little practice, you know? I think maybe we should make this a regular event, you know.",
        "Danny: Mm-hmm.",
        "Michelle: Every time you go out of town, we meet back at the Beacon for a welcome home party.",
        "Danny: That sounds good. I like the sound of that.",
        "Tony: Get a room.",
        "Danny: Hey, hey, hey.",
        "Marah: I guess I know what happened to girl's night.",
        "Michelle: I'm sorry, Marah.",
        "Danny: I got back early.",
        "Marah: That's okay. I was only kidding.",
        "Tony: You got back... Where'd you go?",
        "Danny: I had to go out of town for business. Just a little business.",
        "Michelle: Then he got an early flight back from New York and surprised me.",
        "Tony: New York?",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Tony: What were you doing in New York?",
        "Danny: Well, there's an investor interested in Fifth Street. So I flew to New York to pitch it.",
        "Marah: Wow.",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Marah: I can't believe that anyone in New York would have even heard of Fifth Street.",
        "Tony: Neither would I.",
        "Danny: Well, we put out some feelers and Cassie's been getting us some good press in the business journals. So...",
        "Tony: Really. So is this like an investment group?",
        "Danny: Yeah, pretty much.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, and Danny rode in and in one night, totally sold the guy.",
        "Marah: So you got an investor?",
        "Danny: Yeah, it looks... It looks that way.",
        "Marah: Wow, that's awesome. So now when they come into town, we can show them what a great job we've been doing. We could show them the museum once it's all fixed up.",
        "Danny: Don't knock yourself out. I mean, this guy has got a lot of investments. He's not going to be coming here. I mean it's a big deal to us, but it's not a big deal to him.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, as long as the money's helping out, who cares anyway?",
        "Danny: Right. Right. We didn't call you guys here to talk business.",
        "Michelle: No way.",
        "Tony: Really? What did you have in mind?",
        "Michelle: Wedding. See, the thing is we need a maid of honor and a best man, and we wanted to know if you could recommend a young gorgeous couple who might be available?",
        "Marah: Yes. (Laughter)",
        "Michelle: Thank you.",
        "Danny: So what do you say? You want to be my best man or what?",
        "Tony: Sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ben: Oh, the handkerchief. That's right, Marina. I am so sorry about that.",
        "Marina: You said you lost it, Ben.",
        "Ben: I did. I did. Mrs. Hendon must have found it and thought it was hers, you know? I didn't want anyone to make a big stink about it. I mean, unless it's a big deal to you.",
        "Marina: No. No, it's not the biggest deal of the day.",
        "Ben: Okay. Good. Have you seen my keys anywhere?",
        "Marina: Table down there.",
        "Ben: Thank you. So did you just want to hang out or...",
        "Marina: No. Actually, Ben, I need to talk to you about something, okay? There's something I've been meaning to hash over with you.",
        "Ben: Listen, listen. Once I'm done with work, I'm all yours, but can this wait till later?",
        "Marina: Sure.",
        "Ben: Thank you. You're the best. See you.",
        "Marina: Oh, and, you know, just by the way, honey, a man broke into your house and threatened to hurt me unless I find his stuff. Whatever his stuff is. Okay, Marina, let's get to it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Thanks.",
        "Blake: Hey, Buzz.",
        "Buzz: Hey.",
        "Blake: What the heck are you doing here?",
        "Buzz: Why is everyone always surprised to see me without an apron? I got to get out more, mix it up some, you know.",
        "Blake: Don't we all. No, I'm just surprised to see you in bar, you know, at this hour.",
        "Buzz: Why it's business, Beacon and Company have the same, you know, supplier of wine, beer. I'm bringing back their expensive stuff and they're looking for my cheap stuff. You look... Important.",
        "Blake: Do I?",
        "Buzz: Yeah.",
        "Blake: That's good. That's good. That's what I'm going for. Confident. Ready to take on the world.",
        "Buzz: Check.",
        "Blake: It's not too much though, right? Because if it's too much I would appear pathetic and desperate.",
        "Buzz: No. No, actually it's... it's just right.",
        "Blake: Just right for what?",
        "Buzz: Don't do that to me.",
        "Blake: Look, I'm here on a job interview. I'm meeting somebody in the lobby, and I got here early because I wanted to try out my pitch on Cassie, and I can't find her anywhere. (Laughs) You'll do. I'll practice on you.",
        "Buzz: Huh? I have no idea what you're pitching for.",
        "Blake: No problem. You just have to listen.",
        "Buzz: Don't you have a husband for just this purpose?",
        "Blake: No, no. I can't tell Ross about this. And neither can you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Everything I've done has been for Alan's own good. For the good of the family, for the good of the company. And that does not include Alan being permanently damaged in anyway. So you can stop that kind of talk right now, Lloyd.",
        "Lloyd: I'm sorry.",
        "Alexandra: Well, you should be.",
        "Lloyd: I suppose I feel responsible, too, and compromised.",
        "Alexandra: Nobody knows what you've done except me.",
        "Lloyd: And no one knows what you've done except...",
        "Alexandra: (Gasps) What is this, Lloyd? You're trying to shake me down?",
        "Lloyd: No, not at all. I'm just saying with Mr. Spaulding gone, Phillip is taking his place as you intended. And if Mr. Spaulding doesn't return, we both will be held responsible.",
        "Alexandra: Well, I want Alan found. And whether we do it or the police do it, you are going to have every bit of Spaulding resources available to you. And I wanted him found, do you understand?",
        "Lloyd: Of course.",
        "Alexandra: Good. Because I want Alan home with me, whatever it takes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Here, Frank.",
        "Frank: Thank you, Reva.",
        "Reva: You know, I don't know how Alan could just disappear. Everybody in town would recognize him.",
        "Josh: He's in hiding.",
        "Frank: Possibly.",
        "Josh: He's probably planning his next move against you.",
        "Reva: No, I don't think Alan's capable of something like...",
        "Josh: Do you have any leads at all, Frank?",
        "Frank: No, Josh, I don't. Not yet. But he was spotted leaving the courthouse on foot.",
        "Josh: What about after that?",
        "Frank: Nothing. But I did order an unmarked patrol car to, you know, patrol your neighborhood 24/7.",
        "Josh: One car.",
        "Frank: Josh, that's all I can spare right now. Now if you need more protection, I'll be more than happy...",
        "Reva: Hold on please. Hold on. You saw Alan at the courthouse, Joshua. I mean, I don't think he's capable of planning to hurt me or anyone. The man's in trouble.",
        "Josh: Yes, he is.",
        "Reva: And he's sick. I mean, I could feel... And I could see it. I mean, everybody in the courthouse could see it, even the judge. I mean, if Alan's a danger to anyone, it's to himself. Would you let me help please?",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Frank: Reva, I appreciate your efforts, but that's a bad idea.",
        "Reva: Why? Have you gotten anywhere so far?",
        "Frank: Reva, the last thing I need to do right now is worry about you roaming around the neighborhood unprotected. Now if you want to help me now, you can stay here at your home and next to your husband's side. Thank you for the coffee.",
        "Josh: Thank you.",
        "Reva: (Sighs)",
        "Frank: I will be in touch if I find out anything.",
        "Josh: I'm going to talk to him for just a minute.",
        "Reva: I bet you are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marah: So are you guys thinking like a big bash? The whole town, bridesmaids, the works?",
        "Michelle: We're not really sure yet.",
        "Danny: Yeah, it's not like we've done this before. Once or twice.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, once or twice. We should be getting frequent flyer miles for all our trips down the aisle.",
        "Marah: Yeah, you guys might even have my parents beat by now.",
        "Michelle: I know. And we'll still young.",
        "Danny: Oh, no, no. Don't, don't, don't. This is the last time.",
        "Michelle: Definitely.",
        "Danny: I mean it.",
        "Marah: Well, then you have to throw a huge bash. The dress, the flowers, the organ. Or maybe you guys can have a string quartet.",
        "Michelle: I'm just not sure about the dress. You know, like a big white gown, I think might be a little silly now.",
        "Marah: Okay, well, whatever you do it's going to be fabulous.",
        "Michelle: Will you go shopping with me, because you have such good taste?",
        "Marah: Yes, yes. I think that's, like, my job as the maid of honor. And I have great ideas for the bridesmaid's outfits if you just let me know the colors.",
        "Michelle: Well, that's going to depend on where it's going to be.",
        "Marah: (Sighs) Have you thought about where you want it? This place? Or Father's Ray's church? Or at your house?",
        "Michelle: Maybe. And that way instead of walking down the aisle, we can just emerge out of the tunnel. (Laughter)",
        "Danny: Oh, no, no.",
        "Michelle: Just kidding. We're going to have that thing boarded up before we do any weddings.",
        "Marah: Your new place is perfect. It's such a beautiful space.",
        "Danny: Tony? Tony?",
        "Marah: Hello? We haven't even gotten to the invitation design, you can't be bored yet.",
        "Danny: Well, hello. Maybe I've got some big wedding plans of my own that I need to discuss with my best man.",
        "Michelle: Well, you guys, just go on ahead, because you'll slow us down anyway.",
        "Marah: Right.",
        "Danny: Is that right? Okay. (Laughter) Hey what's up?",
        "Tony: Nothing. Everything's fine, right?",
        "Danny: Yeah. Well, what is it? You're not happy about me and Michelle?",
        "Tony: You know... You know that I am.",
        "Danny: Then what's the matter?",
        "Tony: Tell me something. Does Salerno still have that grease ball Rico carrying his train for him? That's why you were in the city, right? Our new investor?",
        "Danny: Tony...",
        "Tony: Danny, what the hell is going on? Are you still in the business? Or maybe you never got out of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ben: Excuse me. I'm looking for Suite 604. Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: This is ridiculous. Somebody's expecting just, you know, stuff to come jumping up out of me. What? Get me my stuff. Get me my stuff. What stuff is he talking about? Oh. Well, I guess it's got be in there, all right. I hate this, I hate this, I hate this. I really hate this. I really, really, really hate this. I really hate this. Okay. (Screams)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: So what do you think? Do I get the job?",
        "Buzz: Why, if I had a job available. The only one I have available is, like, part-time busboy and I just thought... (Laughs) The thought of you and my granddaughter working together, that scares me.",
        "Blake: Actually I think we would be a good team. But other than that, if you were looking for a public relations person, would I get the job?",
        "Buzz: If I were looking for that, yes, you would. Why aren't you telling this to Ross?",
        "Blake: He just thinks I have enough to do, you know, with the radio show and the kids. And we're shopping for a new house.",
        "Buzz: That's a lot.",
        "Blake: Yeah. Why do I feel so empty though? The radio show is just not doing it for me. And I like living in an apartment. I'm not big on home maintenance.",
        "Buzz: Well, houses... The house is, what, it's good for the kids. Better for, you know...",
        "Blake: Oh, kids are flexible. They go with the flow.",
        "Buzz: Well, this type of job would take time away from them.",
        "Blake: I think the kids would be fine. We have a wonderful sitter.",
        "Buzz: Mm-hmm.",
        "Blake: And kids do well with a working mom as long as the mom loves her work. I know they don't want to see me frustrated all day long.",
        "Buzz: I'm sure Ross doesn't want to see you frustrated.",
        "Blake: Well, after this past year, you know, with everything that happened, he's just so protective me and of us as a family. He doesn't want to see me out there, and I can't wait to get back on the fast track. I know we talked about this, didn't we?",
        "Buzz: Yeah, I have some vague memory talking about P.R.",
        "Blake: Whatever. Anything. As long as it gets me back into the world again. Hey, you know, I have a couple of minutes. I'm going to make a few phone calls and go to the ladies room, and I'm going to wait. Thanks for your company. You know what? You know what? I'm going to stop by later and pick up some take-out for dinner, I think.",
        "Buzz: Hey, you know, what about cooking classes?",
        "Blake: Never. Wish me luck on my interview.",
        "Buzz: Go get 'em, girl. Oh, no.",
        "Ross: Buzz.",
        "Buzz: Hey.",
        "Ross: What a stroke of good luck.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, speak of the devil. How are you?",
        "Ross: I'm well. Thank you. Thank you. Who were you talking to about me?",
        "Buzz: Me. I was talking to myself. I was thinking, you know, I wonder how Ross is doing? I haven't seen much of him lately?",
        "Ross: Oh, how nice. I'm glad to see you, because I'm thinking of pitching an idea to Blake and I need to try it out on someone. Now it wouldn't take very long. Do you have a few minutes?",
        "Buzz: Fire away.",
        "Ross: Okay. Well, as you know, Blake and I sold the carriage house for any number of reasons, and I am subleasing Olivia's apartment.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, how's that going?",
        "Ross: Not well. In fact it's rather dismal. You know, apartment life with three kids, it's comfortable at best. I mean, Buzz, they need a yard. They need room to run. And it's breaks my heart to think about what they're missing.",
        "Buzz: Well, you know, kids are flexible. They just... They go with the flow. You know... At least that's what I've heard. Your kids always seem happy to me.",
        "Ross: Yeah, yeah, they're happy, but I know they would be ecstatic if I could get Blake to go along with my plan.",
        "Buzz: Does it involve cooking classes?",
        "Ross: No, it doesn't, but that is another very, very good idea. Anyway here's my plan. I know for fact that Cassie and her kids are not going back to the Jessup farm to live. And I recently heard Cassie saying that she's thinking about putting it on the market. So I started thinking, Buzz, what better place to raise three kids than a farm? A real working farm. What do you think?",
        "Buzz: Well, I'm sort of a city kid myself. I get nervous when there's not sidewalks.",
        "Ross: I have always thought that the country was the ideal place to raise kids.",
        "Buzz: Yeah. What does Blake think about this?",
        "Ross: Well, I don't know, of course. But I think that she'll love it. It's exactly what she needs. Now, I'm not saying that there's not going to be a period of adjustment, but she needs someplace to pour her energy. Something to put it into. Like a farm. That's a full-time project.",
        "Buzz: Oh, yeah, I bet that... You know, I can't picture Blake out there, you know? Way out there.",
        "Ross: What are you talking about way out there? The Jessup farm is not very far from where we're sitting, Buzz. And you know, she'll see Cassie almost everyday and then Harley and the kids and anybody else's kids, they can come over and have really nice play days, because, you know, I've been thinking about buying a couple of ponies and some chickens and goats.",
