        "Rick: Thank you. You feeling better?",
        "Phillip: I feel okay.",
        "Rick: You seem better than when you left, a lot calmer. It's a good sign that it worked.",
        "Phillip: What worked?",
        "Rick: Ect. You just got back from your first treatment, pal.",
        "Phillip: Where... where was I?",
        "Rick: You just had electroconvulsive therapy. And you know what, pal? It's really common to have some short-term memory loss, but that will improve. In fact, you're going to do nothing but improve from here.",
        "Phillip: I feel like my mind is resting.",
        "Rick: Yeah. I bet that feels good, doesn't it?",
        "Phillip: Yeah. I feel like I can finally get my thoughts together. I'm going to figure out what to do.",
        "Rick: Do about what?",

        "Bill: Hm. Well, you know, it's all in the past.",
        "Olivia: You're kidding. Danny just conceded on television. I would think as the campaign manager, you'd be cleaning up, you know? Spinning the spin.",
        "Bill: (Sighs) well, no, no more campaign, no more campaign manager. Moving on.",
        "Cassie: Okay, no, no, no.",
        "Edmund: Come on, say something.",
        "Cassie: Okay, I am officially in awe of my daughter, tammy. You are the best juliet I've ever seen.",

        "Cassie: Be quiet.",
        "Edmund: (Laughs)",
        "Cassie: You know, she gives you all the credit, she does. Did you see her take her curtain call? She was looking at you the whole time.",
        "Shayne: Hey. (Applause) (cheers and applause)",
        "Beth: Sweetie. Oh, you're just wonderful. You just shined up there.",

        "Michelle: It's okay, baby. Oh, good. You're home.",
        "Danny: What's going on? What's the matter?",
        "Michelle: Robbie was at a friend's house and there was a problem. It's okay, baby. It's okay.",
        "Danny: What do you mean? What kind of problem? What happened?",
        "Michelle: You know how we said we were going to do everything we can to keep him out of this election scandal? Well, we didn't do enough. (applause)",
        "Shayne: That was so good. That was so good.",
        "Cassie: May I have a hug, please. You were wonderful. You were wonderful. You had me in tears the whole time.",
        "Tammy: That bad?",
        "Cassie: Tears of joy! I've never been so proud.",
        "Edmund: And I have the soggy handkerchief to prove it.",
        "Cassie: Yes. (Laughs)",
        "Tammy: Okay, so I have mom's review. What did the shakespeare expert think?",
        "Edmund: I laughed, I cried, I'm going to see it three more times.",
        "Tammy: Okay, stop teasing me. For real. What did you think?",
        "Edmund: Tammy, you were a magnificent juliet. I'd like to think it was my guidance and all those long rehearsals, but you're a natural. You're a genuine talent. Brava.",
        "Sandy: Hey, superstar. Tammy? Can I borrow you for a photo op? Can I borrow her?",
        "Tammy: Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Hi.",
        "Tammy: You were great tonight. So funny.",
        "Lizzie: Thanks.",
        "Tammy: It was so real. I mean, in our scenes together, you really did seem like the old nurse.",
        "Lizzie: Great. Yeah. That's what I was going for.",
        "Joey: Check it out. The reviews are in.",
        "Lizzie: Already?",
        "Joey: It's just the school paper, but whatever. All right. \"Springfield high brushed up on its shakespeare tonight with the debut of 'romeo and juliet.' The show wowed the crowd. Definitely the best production to come out of the school in a long time.\" (Laughter)",
        "Sandy: Good work, guys.",
        "Joey: Wait. \"Excellent directing by sandy foster.\" Who's the man? Who's the man? Okay, wait, wait, wait. Here we go. Here we go. \"Lizzie spaulding sparkled as the nurse. Her comic timing and brilliant delivery left the audience in stitches.\"",
        "Tammy: Oh my gosh, congratulations, lizzie.",
        "Joey: Wait, it gets better.",
        "Lizzie: Is there more about me?",
        "Joey: \"And joey lupo and tammy winslow made for the hottest romeo and juliet since leo and claire did it up on the big screen.\"",
        "Tammy: Shut up. Does it see that? Really?",
        "Joey: Look. \"And no one could hold a candle to tammy winslow's masterful performance. She lit up the whole theater with every line. Ladies and gentlemen, a star is born at springfield high.\"",
        "Tammy: I have to show that to mom and edmund.",
        "Joey: Well, you better be sure to tell them I'm as hot as dicaprio.",
        "Tammy: All right.",
        "Shayne: \"Excellent directing by sandy foster.\" Not too bad, my brother.",
        "Sandy: Well, it's just the school paper.",
        "Marina: Hey, mr. Humble, you did a great job. Would it kill you smile?",
        "Sandy: I'm thinking about marah, you know? She did help with the costumes before everything got all crazy. And she was like my sounding board. Maybe she can make it back in time for closing night, though.",
        "Shayne: Actually, I talked to my dad right before the play and it seems that she might be staying in paris for a little while.",
        "Sandy: How long?",
        "Shayne: Just until she can just clear her head and start over, you know?",
        "Sandy: Hey, good for her, you know? Everyone deserves a chance like that every now and then.",
        "Shayne: Mm-hmm.",
        "Joey: I can't believe her tonight.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I know. Where does she get off?",
        "Joey: She's just so amazing.",
        "Lizzie: Oh. Uh, yeah. Mm-hmm.",
        "Joey: I'm really nervous about later.",
        "Lizzie: Why? The show's over.",
        "Joey: No, I'm singing for her tonight, remember? I have this whole thing planned out. I'm just nervous it's not going to be perfect enough for her because she'S... oh, she's so perfect. Well, wish me luck, okay?",
        "Lizzie: Break a leg. Or my heart. You know, whatever. (Sighs)",
        "Rick: It's an excellent start now, excellent. Okay, now is the time to just relax and take it easy, you know? Just give the treatment some time to take effect before you dive back into life again.",
        "Phillip: Okay. Don't go all doctor on me, rick. I know you're talking about olivia.",
        "Rick: You brought her up.",
        "Phillip: Yeah. Hey, I know I've got a long way to go, but I've got to start dealing with what my life's going to be like on the outside and olivia is part of that.",
        "Rick: No more being a doctor. I'm just going to talk to you as your pal, here. Look, we both know that you jumped into this marriage when you were less than coherent, right?",
        "Phillip: Right.",
        "Rick: So, if you want out, just get out.",
        "Phillip: No, I don't want out.",
        "Rick: Phillip, you don't love her. You don't even like her.",
        "Phillip: It doesn't matter. It's not about that. It's about making this work for my daughter. And if I don't stay with olivia right now, if we're not together, she's going to do everything in her power to take my daughter away from me and i won't let that happen.",
        "Rick: All right. So if you're so together, why don't you just tell her about the ect.",
        "Phillip: No. I mean it. I don't want to worry her.",
        "Rick: Is that the only reason? Or...",
        "Phillip: Or what?",
        "Rick: Or are you afraid of her?",
        "Phillip: Afraid of olivia?",
        "Rick: Mm-hmm.",
        "Phillip: (Laughs) if anything, rick, olivia should be afraid of me.",
        "Olivia: You know, that is a really good move, distancing yourself from everything. You are a lot savior than I gave you credit for. No, that came out wrong. It's impressive. It's really impressive.",
        "Bill: Well, thank you. Thank you, I think. But that's funny, you bringing up the election.",
        "Olivia: What's funny?",
        "Bill: Well, word on the street is the house of spaulding is under scrutiny by the feds itself.",
        "Olivia: I've heard that. But I'm new there.",
        "Bill: Oh. Of course. So we're both in the clear.",
        "Olivia: Are we?",
        "Bill: I am.",
        "Olivia: So am I.",
        "Bill: Very good.",
        "Olivia: Thank you.",
        "Bill: So, tell me, how'S... how's everything else? Phillip and the... phillip and kid.",
        "Olivia: Phillip's coming along and the kid is just great.",
        "Bill: Well, good. Good. I'm looking forward to all that stuff, myself. Marriage and kids and all that.",
        "Olivia: Really? Any time soon?",
        "Bill: Well, hopefully real soon. I am... I am engaged, so...",
        "Olivia: Seriously?",
        "Bill: Yes, yes. And why do you say it like that?",
        "Olivia: No, I just thought you were dating gus's sister, eden.",
        "Bill: I am. I am, I am. In fact, if things go as planned, I will be with her for the rest of my life. So...",
        "Olivia: Congratulations. That's wonderful. Really. She's a lovely girl.",
        "Bill: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Well, I would think you of all people would have a little compassion for her. You know, since you have so much in common.",
        "Michelle: Brian's brothers saw you on tv and started repeating things they heard their parents saying.",
        "Danny: Hey. Tiger. People saying not nice things about me?",
        "Michelle: They don't know your daddy, sweetie. Right? Not like we do. And we know he's one of the good guys. That's why we love him so much, right? You going to tell your daddy how you love him?",
        "Robbie: Love you.",
        "Danny: Oh, I love you, buddy. It's okay. It's okay. (Sighs) he should go to bed. You tired? You ready for bed? Okay. You want to take him up?",
        "Michelle: Yeah.",
        "Danny: Mommy's going to take you up and get you ready for bed. I'll be up in a little bit, okay?",
        "Michelle: Okay.",
        "Danny: Give me a kiss.",
        "Olivia: We have a lot in common? I don't really see the see the similarities.",
        "Bill: Well, you're both beautiful and you're smart, and it seems to me like you spent your lives looking in from the outside. Well, I've got to go.",
        "Olivia: Good luck. Good luck. And I'm still hoping that we can work together one of these days.",
        "Bill: Well, you never know. I'm taking my life in a whole new direction, so we just might.",
        "Olivia: Give my best to eden, will you?",
        "Bill: Well, you bet. Same to phillip. And uh... and the kid. All right?",
        "Olivia: Bye.",
        "Edmund: I want to thank you.",
        "Cassie: For what?",
        "Edmund: For letting me into your life, for letting me into your children's lives. I never thought that working on a high school play would be particularly gratifying, but i have to say, I found the whole thing strangely rewarding.",
        "Cassie: Well, there's nothing strange about it. It's called parenting. And speaking of being a good parent, shouldn't I know where my daughter is?",
        "Edmund: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: Have you seen her?",
        "Edmund: No. I'll find her, though.",
        "Shayne: So, sandman, I think the question is, have you been checking out any of the young ladies tonight.",
        "Marina: Shayne.",
        "Shayne: What? They're his age. We can set you up with somebody.",
        "Sandy: Uh, thanks, but I'm okay.",
        "Shayne: You don't look okay. And you know, man, listen, you're not the only one that's upset that marah's going to be in paris for a while, but she has to get on with her life and we have to get on with our life, too.",
        "Marina: I'll be right back.",
        "Beth: Tammy did a wonderful job.",
        "Cassie: Well, thank you. And so did lizzie! I mean, who would have thought she was such a wonderful actress.",
        "Beth: Mmm...",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: I know you guys have been having a tough time with her. I'm sorry, beth. I mean, if there's anything i can do.",
        "Beth: Cassie, you've already done it. There were a dozen different times that you could have cut lizzie out of tammy's life, and you didn't, and I want to thank you for that. I think that tammy is a good influence and I think my daughter is very lucky to have her as a friend.",
        "Cassie: Thank you. How is lizzie doing?",
        "Beth: Uh, well, we're taking it day by day, trying to get her the help that she needs. It's tough right now, because phillip is still in the hospital. But anyway, nights like these, these are the good ones, right?",
        "Cassie: You know what? These are the ones to remember. (Laughter)",
        "Edmund: You know, I thought I'd find juliet out on the balcony. Darling, I admire your commitment to character, but your entire fan club is inside.",
        "Tammy: I just needed a minute to-- I don't know-- soak it all in. Been through a lot of bad times that seemed to last forever. I mean, every once in a while, you get a really great moment and it just flies by. I guess I just wanted to make this one last a little bit longer.",
        "Edmund: Well, you found a perfect place to do it. A star among the stars. Your school paper even said so. \"A star is born at springfield high.\" Don't ever sell yourself short. You were spectacular tonight, an earth-treading star that makes the dark heaven light.",
        "Michelle: Well, I finally got him to sleep. Needless to say, robbie won't be going to brian's house any time soon. Danny? What is it?",
        "Danny: We need to talk. (Sighs) there's something I need to tell you, something that I've tried to keep you away from. But I can't do it anymore.",
        "Michelle: What are you talking about?",
        "Danny: The truth. Honey, you need to know the truth about me. The inside scoop from oprah's producers, next \"oprah.\"",
        "Tammy: This night just keeps getting better.",
        "Edmund: Tammy, we have to talk...",
        "Tammy: I have to get back inside. Don't tell mom or anything, okay?",
        "Edmund: Tammy...",
        "Joey: There you are. I've been looking all over for you. Look, stay right there, all right? Don't go anywhere. I mean it.",
        "Lizzie: Hey, tammy. Are you okay?",
        "Tammy: What? Yeah. I just have to go.",
        "Lizzie: Where?",
        "Tammy: Tonight's just so great, I want to go home and write it all down before i forget about it, you know?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah! You know what? You better hurry up and write it down before you forget it. That's a great idea.",
        "Tammy: Uh-huh. See you later.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, wait. Didn't joey say something about...",
        "Tammy: Oh. Yeah. Would you just tell him I had to go?",
        "Lizzie: Sure, if that's what you want me to do. Okay.",
        "Shayne: There she is, my cousin tammy. The prettiest juliet ever.",
        "Lizzie: That's right, go write in your stupid little journal, tammy. I'll take care of joey.",
        "Edmund: All right. All right, I need to tell cassie about this. Maybe I should sit tammy down first. Maybe I should sit them both down. What the hell just happened here?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, poor joey. Tammy just doesn't appreciate you, but I do.",
        "Joey: Lizzie, have you seen tammy?",
        "Lizzie: Um...",
        "Bill: Working on a big case, chief?",
        "Frank: Oh, hey bill. No. My daughter, for the life of her, cannot hold onto her keys, so she feels like she lost them here, so I told her I'd come by and see if I could find them for her and bring them to her. Bingo.",
        "Bill: Perfect. You're a good dad, frank.",
        "Frank: Yes, I am.",
        "Bill: It's going to be a little weird, though, when the police chief shows up at a teen party.",
        "Frank: Well, it's a kind of an after-party for the high school play. It's at towers.",
        "Bill: Fancy.",
        "Frank: And what are you doing here?",
        "Bill: Well, you ever have a conversation with someone, you remember all the stuff you want to say when it's over?",
        "Frank: Uh, yeah. That happens every single time i talk to my father, my daughter and my sister.",
        "Bill: Yeah. I thought of a good closing statement, but it looks like my sparring partner's gone.",
        "Frank: And that would be eden?",
        "Bill: Olivia, actually, but it was about eden.",
        "Frank: Well, speaking of which, how's she doing these days?",
        "Bill: She's good. Good, thanks.",
        "Frank: You know what? Why don't the two of you join us for dinner? Darci's taking some cooking classes and she's looking for some people to experiment on. Seriously, just have eden call darci.",
        "Bill: Oh, come on, frank. You really want eden as a dinner guest?",
        "Olivia: Hello. How are you?",
        "Phillip: I'm good.",
        "Olivia: Yeah?",
        "Phillip: I'm good.",
        "Olivia: I didn't wake you up, did I?",
        "Phillip: No. No, actually... actually, I was just sitting here thinking about you. Hey, you look great.",
        "Olivia: Oh. Thanks. So do you. I guess this means you're feeling better.",
        "Phillip: Yeah. (Laughs) yeah, I am. I really am. Just what we've been hoping for, huh?",
        "Olivia: Absolutely.",
        "Phillip: I tell you what, i think if I keep feeling like this, I'm going to be out of here before you know it. And then we can start our life together, start raising our daughter together. Hey, I think I owe somebody a honeymoon, don't I?",
        "Olivia: Oh, well, that sounds like a dream. Really. But you know, once you get out of here, you're going to have to take things slowly. And I have to say, you do seem a little different. More clear. Do your doctors know about this... how you've made this sudden improvement?",
        "Phillip: Oh, well, for them it's just a big mystery, but i know.",
        "Olivia: You do?",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm. It's you. Your love has made me a new man.",
        "Danny: Remember when we went to the beach last year with robbie?",
        "Michelle: Yeah.",
        "Danny: And the two of you spent half the day working on that sand castle, made it look just like our house.",
        "Michelle: Yeah. It was some castle, wasn't it?",
        "Danny: Yeah. What happened to it?",
        "Michelle: The tide came in and washed it away.",
        "Danny: Because you built it too close to the water.",
        "Michelle: I never thought robbie would stop crying.",
        "Danny: But he did stop. Because of what you said to him. Do you remember what you said to him?",
        "Michelle: Yes. I told him that next year we'd build an even bigger sand castle further up the beach, that would be safe.",
        "Danny: That's what I tried to do. I tried to do that, michelle. I tried to find a safe spot for us.",
        "Michelle: What do you mean?",
        "Danny: And I wish that i could tell you the same thing that you told robbie, that we'll get another chance.",
        "Michelle: Okay, you're starting to scare me now.",
        "Danny: I built our life too close to the water. And I thought that we'd be okay, I really did. I really did. But what I have to tell you, it's enough to wipe us out.",
        "Michelle: Danny, if this is about the election and how they took it from you...",
        "Danny: No. No, it's not. No, no. It started before then, back when... you remember when i decided to go clean and I wanted to break free of the other families.",
        "Michelle: And you did. You did.",
        "Danny: (Sighs) you remember I told you it wasn't going to be that simple? That you can't just break clean away? It would have left me with nothing, nothing to start over with.",
        "Michelle: I don't understand. I...",
        "Danny: When I made the decision tbreak up the santos crime family and sell off my mob interests, I didn't exactly give everything up. I made a deal with salerno so that I could continue to receive a cut of some of the business that I gave him, sanitation and construction.",
        "Michelle: Dirty money?",
        "Danny: I needed it, michelle. I did. It was the only way I could make fifth street happen, and i really believed-- i really believed-- that construction and sanitation were the lesser of the evils, and they weren't hurting anybody, and that i could really do good with that money. It was the only way I could get fifth street off the ground.",
        "Michelle: All of fifth street? All of it is built on mob money?",
        "Danny: No, not all of it. You've got to believe me that i really thought that if I could give back enough to that community-- that community that my family destroyed-- and give them more housing and more jobs, that would justify what I was doing.",
        "Michelle: Oh, god, danny, what have you done?",
        "Danny: Michelle, I've done a lot of good. That neighborhood is booming. You know that. You've seen it.",
        "Michelle: You are a liar. Everything you told me this past year-- everything-- about coming clean and leaving crime behind was a lie.",
        "Danny: No. Just in the beginning, so we could get on our feet, michelle. I had to do it.",
        "Michelle: For what? For what?",
        "Danny: Us. We would have had nothing...",
        "Michelle: No.",
        "Danny: ...If I didn't do it.",
        "Michelle: Liar! You're a liar! (Door slams)",
        "Olivia: No, I can't take credit for this. You and your doctors must be trying something new.",
        "Phillip: No. No, it's you. Just between the two of us, i wasn't exactly sticking to the program. I wasn't taking my medication all the time because the doctors and nurses, I'd just... I didn't feel like I could really trust them. But then I realized they're the only people that I can trust.",
        "Olivia: Oh?",
        "Phillip: Yeah. If I want to get home to my adoring wife and my kids, my new baby girl, then I have to do everything the doctors tell me to do. Yeah, I had like A... hm. What's the word I'm looking for?",
        "Olivia: An epiphany?",
        "Phillip: An epiphany. I had an epiphany. And rick says that if I keep going like this, I'll be able to go home in no time. You know, I guess... I guess all I really needed was to make myself work at it, and I needed a reason to do that. And that's you. You're the reason.",
        "Olivia: Well, I'm just beyond words.",
        "Phillip: I bet. Pretty exciting, huh?",
        "Olivia: Yeah, it is. Still, you know, you don't want to push it. Things are fine at home. Emma and I have moved into the house and I seem to be getting along surprisingly well with everyone.",
        "Phillip: Yeah. Even with lizzie?",
        "Olivia: Yes, even with lizzie. So don't push yourself, all right? That's what got you in here in the first place.",
        "Phillip: Oh, I know. (Chuckles) I've learned so much in here.",
        "Olivia: And I want that to continue, I do. I just... I want you to avoid any stress that might slow down your recovery.",
        "Phillip: Then I guess you'll just have to make sure you don't stress me out.",
        "Frank: Of course we would love to have you guys over for dinner. I mean, the girls are old friends.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, sometimes people would like to forget they're old friends.",
        "Frank: Yes, I'm sure the girls would like to forget about their past, but that doesn't mean they can't be friends. I mean, darci still cares about eden.",
        "Bill: I'm sure she does, but what about you, frank. Huh? Do you like eden?",
        "Frank: Yeah. She's fine, yeah.",
        "Bill: Oh, man.",
        "Frank: What, are you asking me a loaded question, here?",
        "Bill: No, I'M... look, I'm sorry. It's just... I love eden s much. I mean, I love the way she's faced her demons and she's conquered them. She's worked so hard to make a new life for herself.",
        "Frank: Well, good for her. She's lucky to have a guy like you, who acknowledges and appreciates that.",
        "Bill: See, now that's another thing right there. Everyone says how lucky eden is, but no one ever says how lucky i am to have her. You know? And she knows that. And I hate that for her.",
        "Frank: Don't worry about that, bill. It'll gets easier with time.",
        "Bill: Well, even people like olivia spencer think they have the right to look down on her.",
        "Frank: Olivia?",
        "Bill: Yeah, I mean, come on, olivia is just as much of an outlaw as eden ever was, so...",
        "Frank: Funny you should say that. I've never really pictured olivia as an outlaw. I mean, it's kind of an interesting image, but...",
        "Bill: (Laughs)",
        "Frank: To be honest with you, I really don't put the two girls in the same category.",
        "Bill: See? See what I mean? That's what I'm talking about.",
        "Frank: Bill, let me just share a little history with you, here. My family has definitely made its share of mistakes and shame on me if I don't accept eden for who she is now. You know what I'm saying?",
        "Bill: Thank you, frank. I appreciate that.",
        "Frank: It's all right. I've got to get to towers, so I'll drop off the keys to my daughter.",
        "Bill: You know, I can take those to marina because I want to swing by and say hi to cassie and tammy anyway, so...",
        "Frank: All right. Thank you.",
        "Bill: You got it.",
        "Frank: Bill?",
        "Bill: Hm?",
        "Frank: I meant what I said about eden.",
        "Bill: Thank you, and you're right. Everyone deserves the opportunity to forget about their past.",
        "Joey: Tammy's always thinking that I'm not good enough for her. And you know what? She's so great that sometimes i start thinking that, too, but tonight was going to be the night where I show her that i could be the guy that she wants, you know? With the play and the song. Like in the movies, you know? She drags me to all these chick flicks and there's always this big, hopeless romantic gesture scene. And this was it. This was going to be our scene tonight.",
        "Lizzie: Well, um, the show must go on.",
        "Joey: What?",
        "Lizzie: That's what sandy told us before the curtain went up tonight: That even if you mess up or you flub up on a line that you have to embrace the unexpected.",
        "Joey: Yeah, well, that might work in the play, but, I mean, how can I sing to a girl who's not even here?",
        "Lizzie: Well, you can sing to a girl who is here. Just think of it as the dress rehearsal and I'll be the stand- in.",
        "Cassie: Hey.",
        "Edmund: Oh, hey.",
        "Cassie: So, did you find tammy?",
        "Edmund: Yes, I did. I did. And then I lost her again. Cassie, there's something...",
        "Joey: Hi, everyone. Can I have your attention, please? I had something special prepared for my leading lady tonight, but unfortunately, she had to go. But a friend of mine said i should go ahead and do it anyway. I mean, why not? Practice makes perfect, right, sandy?",
        "Sandy: Oh, yeah. We know how you love those long rehearsals, lupo.",
        "Joey: (Laughs) well, here we go. Tammy, this one's for you. And you can tell everybody this is your song it may be quite simple but now that it's done I hope you don't mind I hope you don't mind that I put down in words how wonderful life is now you're in the world I sat on the roof and I kicked off the moss well some of these verses well, they got me quite cross but the sun's been kind while I wrote this song it's for people like you that keep them turned on so excuse me forgetting but these things I do you see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue oh, i well, the thing is what I really mean yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen. (Cheers and applause)",
        "Olivia: I don't want to stress you out. How could you even think that knowing that it could risk your recovery?",
        "Phillip: Is that a rhetorical question? (Laughing) I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I guess I just feel so good, I'm a little giddy.",
        "Olivia: I know. I know that you can't wait to get out of here. I don't want you to come to this prematurely.",
        "Phillip: No. The sooner the better. The sooner the better. You're going to need my help at the house.",
        "Olivia: Why would you say that?",
        "Phillip: I know my family. I know you're bound to have problems with alan and alexandra. You shouldn't have to go in battle alone. No, we're man and wife. We're a team. And we're going to be a team in a way that we've never been a team before. Running the family, running the company.",
        "Olivia: Well, that's all i ever wanted, you know, the two of us together. But I would never seriously risk your heath to further my own cause.",
        "Phillip: You're really something else. Always thinking about me. You've taken such good care of me, olivia. I can't wait for the day that i can take care of you.",
        "Cassie: Gosh, I can't believe that tammy missed this.",
        "Edmund: Yeah, it's a shame. Joey did a great job.",
        "Cassie: Where is she?",
        "Shayne: I think it's time for my girl to hit the dance floor.",
        "Marina: You're up for dancing?",
        "Shayne: Not me. Not tonight. But the sandman can fill in.",
        "Sandy: Are you saying you want me to dance with your girlfriend?",
        "Shayne: I'm saying that i want my girl to have a good time. And you happen to have the stronger legs at the moment. So...",
        "Sandy: You mean, you're not afraid that I might just sweep her off her feet?",
        "Shayne: Well, I still have the stronger arms. So if you sweep her off her feet, I'll just knock you off yours. Fair enough?",
        "Sandy: Ow! Fair enough. Well put big brother. What do you say, marina?",
        "Marina: I really don't have to dance, shayne. Really.",
        "Shayne: No, baby, go.",
        "Marina: I'm fine right here.",
        "Shayne: Will you go? I'm tired of watching these amateurs. Go, go. Give me this. Have fun.",
        "Cassie: Tammy would be loving this. Where is she?",
        "Beth: So tammy's boyfriend has quite a voice, huh?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, and he's this total baseball stud. And did you see how great he did in the play? Tammy's so lucky. If I had joey as my boyfriend... you know what? I should probably go congratulate him.",
        "Beth: Lizzie. Never mind.",
        "Lizzie: Hey there, rock star. Oh, my gosh, you told me you were going to sing. I didn't think it was going to be like that.",
        "Joey: You liked it?",
        "Tammy: It was amazing. I was so impressed.",
        "Joey: Thanks. I'm really glad that you made me go up there and do it. You catch my little thank you wink?",
        "Lizzie: Is that what that was?",
        "Joey: Yeah.",
        "Lizzie: Well, if you ever need any more encouragement for your next performance, you know who to call. You did really great.",
        "Joey: Thanks, lizzie. I just wish tammy saw it, you know.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, that's too bad.",
        "Tammy: Usually I write what i need to vent and that's a lot. But tonight... tonight I had the most perfect night. So perfect that I'm afraid if i don't put it down on paper, I'll forget how it feels forever. From the moment the curtain went up it's all been so surreal, like I'm watching someone else living my life a million times better than I ever could. But it was me up on the stage. It was me getting the applause. It was me out on that balcony.",
        "Danny: Look, you have to understand something. All I wanted was to be the father and the husband you and robbie deserved. I wanted to give you a name...",
        "Michelle: Don't even say that.",
        "Danny: ...That you could be proud of. I didn't think it could hurt us. I didn't think it could hurt me. If I did, do you think I would have felt safe enough to run for office? And then we got caught up with the campaign and I really convinced myself that what I was doing was for the best. I never dreamed that it would make us vulnerable. Never. I'm sorry. I was wrong. (Door closes)",
        "Tammy: Next on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Danny: I got myself into this situation. I'm going to get myself out of it on my own. It's my problem.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, like hell it is.",
        "Olivia: You know what? Maybe you're right, darling. Maybe time away is just what you need.",
        "Phillip: As long as it's not time away from you."
