        "Inside Company, Coop tells Ava that Lizzie is pregnant. She is shocked and thinks Lizzie is faking it to keep Coop. A British gentleman arrives to interview Coop for Oxford and Coop tries to muddle his way through. At the police station, Tammy gets Remy to rescind the restraining order against Jonathan. A suspicious Remy is in disbelief. At Lizzie's apartment, Jonathan questions her about being pregnant and if the baby is his. She assures him that she was pregnant when she slept with him and that the baby is Coops. A relieved Jonathan and Lizzie decide no one will know about their night together.",
        "Finding Gus at Cedars, Harley questions him about why he is there. After explaining to her that he had to interview a nurse, he hugs her and grabs a pad of prescriptions, stuffing them in his pocket. Harley starts to leave as Gus asks a nurse her name and where the pharmacy is, gets some drugs and takes one. He rapidly gets sleepy and has blurred vision. Mallet calls him into work at the police station and a reluctant Gus obliges. After arriving outside Company, Harley tries to phone the nurse with whom Gus had an interview. Dinah sees her and attempts to have a conversation but Harley is preoccupied. Harley starts to leave as she realizes the nurse has no idea of what she speaks and Dinah grabs Harley telling her she will not just walk away from her. Dinah finally, after raking Harley over the coals for ignoring her, tells her that what's wrong is that she slept with her boyfriend. Harley tries to tell Dinah that she and Mallet regretted it the moment it happened. Gus and Mallet get a lead on the Marler case and go on a stake out waiting on an airplane mechanic. As they sit in the car, it is obvious Gus has very blurred vision and keeps falling asleep. Suddenly, Mallet sees the man they are looking for and tells Gus to act casually. Gus tries to get out of the car but has great difficulty. He sees through blurred vision the man in question point a gun as gunfire rings out. Gus drops his gun and slides down the car side, grabbing his chest in disbelief as Mallet looks on in slow motion. Harley receives a phone call from the police station. Dinah listens in shock as Harley says, \"What, who was shot?\""

        "Harley: Yeah. So I went to Company and Ava told me you sent Marina ahead to the park with the kids.",
        "Gus: Yeah, well, it couldn't be helped. Because I had to come over to this place to get a deposition.",
        "Harley: Oh.",
        "Gus: Well, you know, go back to them. I'll catch up to you and we'll... we're going to throw the ball around.",
        "Harley: How's your leg?",

        "Dinah: What are you doing? What are you doing? Okay. My lipstick. ( Laughing ) You are into this, aren't you?",
        "Mallet: Just one more for the road?",
        "Dinah: Okay, okay, okay. Okay, ow, ow! Watch it, watch it!",
        "Mallet: What? I'm trying to show my girlfriend who's number one here.",
        "Dinah: Well, thank you. I love that. I love that. There better not be a number two.",
        "Mallet: There's no number two. Or three or four or five, unless number one doesn't want me, and I'll have plenty of time to convince her when we get to the island.",
        "Dinah: Seven days. Seven days, wow. Just to relax?",
        "Mallet: Yes. You can sleep in, you can feed me breakfast in bed. You still don't want to go, do you?",
        "Dinah: No, it's not... it's not that I don't want to go. I just... I'm a little wigged out. Why is Harley so anxious to get me out of town?",
        "Mallet: Because she's doing you a favor. You need to just enjoy it. You just need to enjoy me.",
        "Dinah: Okay. You know I do, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: So where are my shoes?",
        "Coop: Oh. I forgot.",
        "Ava: Okay, so, wait a minute. Let me guess here: Lizzie ambushed you again. Well, what bombshell did she drop on you this time?",
        "Coop: I... I tracked her down to her apartment.",
        "Ava: And she lured you there with my shoes.",
        "Coop: Yeah. And when I walked in, there were all these... baby things.",

        "Coop: Clothes and toys, and...",
        "Ava: And I don't understand.",
        "Coop: Ava, she's pregnant. Lizzie is pregnant. Lizzie's pregnant. Ava, I don't know what to say.",
        "Ava: Well, I do. She's a lying, vindictive little bitch.",

        "Remy: Great. The infamous restraining order against your boyfriend, Jonathan.",
        "Tammy: Can you really make it go away?",
        "Remy: You sure you want me to?",
        "Tammy: Jonathan and I, we were having some problems. I overreacted. It was a total mistake.",
        "Remy: I've heard that before. Most of our domestic violence cases are...",
        "Tammy: Remy, no, no. Jonathan would never hurt me. Can you help me with this? I asked Marina, but she told me I had to come down to the station. So here I am.",
        "Remy: I'll take care of it on one condition.",
        "Tammy: What?",
        "Remy: Prove you're right about Jonathan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: How did you get in here?",
        "Jonathan: Hey, goldilocks. You have something you want to tell me?",
        "Lizzie: Get out. I'm not decent.",
        "Jonathan: Nope, it doesn't work that way. Not until I get an answer for my question. Tammy has this crazy idea that you might be pregnant. So, tell me, should I be handing out cigars?",
        "Gus: I have to do the deposition. That's the nurse I have to interview.",
        "Harley: You seem awfully anxious to get rid of me.",
        "Gus: I'm trying to prove to your brother I'm back full force.",
        "Harley: Are you? Because if you're not, why not take some time off?",
        "Gus: If you just go to the kids and I'll join you and we'll go to dinner, we'll throw the ball around. We'll go to the movies or something. We'll act like a normal family.",
        "Harley: Us a normal family?",
        "Gus: So, you know, like an hour or two maximum.",
        "Harley: Okay.",
        "Gus: Okay? Good.",
        "Harley: Bye.",
        "Gus: What does your name tag say there?",
        "Nurse: Martha. Martha Gerrity. Can I help you?",
        "Gus: Martha. Uh, yeah. Martha, where's the pharmacy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Come on, you do know that... cream and sugar?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, thanks.",
        "Mallet: You do know you're amazing, right? And you're brilliant and you're capable and... did I forget something?",
        "Dinah: I'm house-broken.",
        "Mallet: ( Laughs ) You're house-broken, and you're also beautiful.",
        "Dinah: Thank you.",
        "Mallet: But you know all of that, right?",
        "Dinah: Yes, I do, I do. Which is why I don't understand Harley trying to get me out of town so fast, why I have to be sent away.",
        "Mallet: Listen, I know you're feeling a little pushed-aside right now, and that's understandable. But you took over Spaulding on, what, an hour's notice? You were great as a CEO, you're a walking wonder, okay? And Harley knows that, and you know that she knows that, right?",
        "Dinah: Does she? I don't know.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, of course she does.",
        "Dinah: You're right. As much as I hate to admit it, you're right.",
        "Mallet: Thank you. You're going to have to get used to that. You're going to have to accept the fact I'm almost always right. I'll see you tonight.",
        "Dinah: Okay.",
        "Mallet: So call me if you need anything.",
        "Dinah: All right.",
        "Mallet: Call me even if you don't need anything.",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs )",
        "Mallet: Just call me.",

        "Harley: I cannot believe this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Her mother is pregnant. She probably sees all of the attention she is getting and she thinks, \"Oh, yes, I want to be pregnant, too, and get all of the attention.\"",
        "Coop: I know, but at my birthday party, Lizzie and I were dancing, okay? And she even told me that she was dizzy and that she had nausea. I mean, those are symptoms, right?",
        "Ava: Yeah, they're symptoms of too much tequila. Coop, when you broke up with her, she was miserable. Then she finds out you got into Oxford, and then \"oh, well, gee, we can't have that, so...\"",
        "Coop: Look, I know, okay. Believe me, this makes perfect sense.",
        "Ava: It does. It's the perfect way. By the time you find out there's no baby, it's too late. You've passed on the fellowship at Oxford, and keeping you from Oxford isn't the only thing she's trying to keep you from here. There's me, too.",
        "Coop: Ava, look, I want nothing more than for you to be right, okay, really. But we both have to face the reality of the situation, and that reality is that Lizzie might be telling the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: All of the complaints on this restraining order are exaggerated.",
        "Remy: It says here he was stalking you, following you everywhere.",
        "Tammy: Guys like the chase, Remy, right? I mean, without the chase they lose interest.",
        "Remy: It depends on the guy.",
        "Tammy: I love Jonathan, okay? Don't believe me? Give me a lie detector test. You want to know the real reason why I got the restraining order? To restrain myself because I couldn't stay away from him.",
        "Remy: Why did you want to?",
        "Tammy: It's a long story.",
        "Remy: I've got time. We could order takeout.",
        "Tammy: Okay, are we done here?",
        "Remy: Officially, yes.",
        "Tammy: And unofficially?",
        "Remy: You and I go back. And I'm not saying this because I used to have a crush on you. This Randall guy has a record.",
        "Tammy: Don't, don't. I know what you're thinking. Jonathan's a loser, he's a deadbeat who would lie, who would steal, who would threaten people if push came to shove.",
        "Remy: Well, would he?",
        "Tammy: Yes. He would do all of that and more for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Get your hands off of me.",
        "Jonathan: Answer the question, Lizzie. Are you pregnant or not?",
        "Lizzie: It is none of your business.",
        "Jonathan: So you're saying it's not mine?",
        "Lizzie: Are you here because you really care and because you want to be a daddy? Gee, I'm touched. Now get out. I'm going to count to three and then I'm going to scream. One, two...",
        "Jonathan: Three. You know why you're not going to scream? Because I can make your life a living hell.",
        "Lizzie: I have no idea what Tammy sees in you. You are nothing but a menace, and the sex wasn't even that good. Well, okay, I lied. It was great, but that's besides the point.",
        "Jonathan: Cut the crap! Lizzie, answer the question! Are you pregnant or not?",
        "Lizzie: Yes, I am, okay? I'm pregnant, I'm knocked up, I'm in a family way. Now get your hands off of me!",
        "Jonathan: Okay. What are we going to do about it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: I cannot believe this! Did I lose my phone again?",
        "Dinah: You know, Harley, I'd like to talk to you again about a few things that have been on my mind.",
        "Harley: Oh, here it is, here it is. Can you give me just one second? I have to make this one phone call, maybe two, because I was supposed to meet Marina at the park with the boys, but... Gus. Gus. Nurse... hi, Nurse Gerrity, please. Yes, I'll hold.",
        "Dinah: It's about the week that you've given me off. I want to talk to you about that.",
        "Harley: It's Gerrity. I don't know her first name, but she's a nurse in ER. Thank you, I'll hold. I'm sorry, what... what are you saying?",
        "Dinah: I want to talk about the week you've given me off. I don't think it's a very good idea. If you're not looking at the records, I don't know, but this is a very huge week for Spaulding, and I think you need my help.",
        "Harley: That would be great. Yes, paging her, because this is urgent. I really appreciate it, thanks. I'm listening to you, I am, and you said \"Help.\" And of course, you're always a big help, Dinah. Of course you're a help.",
        "Dinah: If you don't want my input, that's fine. But what I'm telling you is that I've covered your job for a very long time, and I want to talk about my role at the company.",
        "Harley: Nurse Gerrity. Oh, I'm so glad that I caught you. I have to ask you some questions.",
        "Dinah ( whispering ): And I want to talk about how angry I am right now. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Come on. Whoever it is... yeah, we don't want any.",
        "Mallet: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Is that any way to talk to your partner?",
        "Gus: It's my day off.",
        "Mallet: It's not your day off anymore. We need you, so you need to get down here.",
        "Gus: I'm napping.",
        "Mallet: You napped for months up in the cabin, okay? If anyone takes a nap, that would be moi.",
        "Gus: Well, go take a nap.",
        "Mallet: I can't. The Commissioner wants all the paperwork up to date for inspection... are you listening to me? Inspection at the end of the week.",
        "Gus: Every single case file?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, that's right. And if you don't help me, if you don't come down here and pitch in, I'm going to have to cancel my trip with Dinah, and that's not going to happen. So you're going to have to move it, move it, move it. Now. Let's go.",
        "Gus: Isn't there some sort of a way you can handle that all by yourself?",
        "Mallet: There isn't. It's just paperwork, okay? Do you have a problem with that, Gus? What's up?",
        "Gus: It's not a problem. I'll be there. Not a problem. Paperwork. Secure the paperwork.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: So call Lizzie up and tell her you want her to take another pregnancy test, a real pregnancy test. Not the at-home, do-it-yourself kind, but at a doctor's office.",
        "Coop: Ava, how can you not be freaked out about this?",
        "Ava: Because there's nothing to freak out about. I mean, we don't really know what's going on, do we?",
        "Coop: No, we don't, but... you know what? You're right. You're right.",
        "Ava: So just tell her you'll go with her, make sure she takes the pregnancy test, not her mother. And don't let her out of your sight, all right? Not for a second.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, it's me. Call me back as soon as you get this, okay? There's some stuff we need to talk about, and I think you know what I mean. So... look, I just need some... some answers. Now we wait.",
        "Ava: I have one kind of weird question for you. When you guys were together, did you use birth control?",
        "Coop: Yeah, we did. But, I mean, that's never 100% now, is it?",
        "Cecil: Henry Cooper Bradshaw?",
        "Coop: Yeah.",
        "Cecil: Cecil Knightly, Oxford Alumni. I'm here for our interview. Is this a bad time?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Remy: The judge agreed to cancel the restraining order.",
        "Tammy: Thank you. Don't look at me like that.",
        "Remy: Like what?",
        "Tammy: With those eyes.",
        "Remy: How else am I supposed to look?",
        "Tammy: Being a cop has made you very judgmental.",
        "Remy: No, growing up with a professor and a shrink for parents did that. Sign here.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan's not what you think.",
        "Remy: And what do I think?",
        "Tammy: He just... he just doesn't have boundaries, you know? I mean, especially when it comes to protecting me. If I were hurt or I were in danger...",
        "Remy: Watch out!",
        "Tammy: I was going to say he would sacrifice himself.",
        "Remy: That's noble.",
        "Tammy: It's true. He already has proved it once.",
        "Remy: You don't have to explain yourself to me.",
        "Tammy: You'd like him if you got to know him. Okay, he is a little rough around the edges.",
        "Remy: Now there's an understatement.",
        "Tammy: Well, he's had a tough life and he tends to take it out on other people sometimes. But there's something else about him, something that other people, they don't know.",
        "Remy: What's that?",
        "Tammy: How sweet he is and how kind. And he feels things more than people do, and I love... I love him. So write that on your restraining order.",
        "Remy: Write about someone's feelings on a police report? No thanks. The guys don't appreciate that. Here you go.",
        "Tammy: Thank you.",
        "Remy: Null and void.",
        "Tammy: Thank you, thank you, thank you, Remy. I owe you for this.",
        "Remy: Tammy. Just remember I'm here if you need me.",

        "Lizzie: You think you can take care of this? You think you can just come in here and threaten me and my baby? Because you can't. There is nothing you can do. It's done, okay, it happened. I'm pregnant, there's a baby...",
        "Jonathan: Shut up, shut up, shut up! Just shut up. You are not the only one affected here. This isn't all about you. I was trying to have a life, and this can ruin it. Damn it, I'm trying to have a life with Tammy, and now...",
        "Lizzie: Now what? Get over yourself, Jonathan. The baby isn't yours.",
        "Jonathan: No?",
        "Lizzie: No. It's Coop's baby, not yours.",
        "Jonathan: Are you sure?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, of course I'm sure. Because I was already pregnant before I slept with you.",

        "Lizzie: Far enough. Now go away.",
        "Jonathan: How far?",
        "Lizzie: A couple of weeks, okay? Now go. You already know more than you should.",
        "Jonathan: How much does your family know?",
        "Lizzie: Nothing, okay? I went to a clinic out of town, I used a different name. Nobody knows because I wanted it that way.",
        "Jonathan: Well, Lizzie, there are signs, you know, symptoms.",
        "Lizzie: I live alone, Jonathan. It's kind of easy to hide.",

        "Jonathan: And how much did he freak out?",
        "Lizzie: He was okay. Okay, yeah, he freaked out. But Coop is a good guy, and I know that he loves me, and I know he is going to love this baby, too.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. Look. Just one more time. Lizzie, are you absolutely sure that it's not my baby?",
        "Lizzie: Yes, I am absolutely sure, that this is Coop's baby. I remember the exact moment that I conceived. It was like one of those perfect nights where you just know that something special is going to happen. And I felt so different afterwards...",
        "Jonathan: Okay, okay. That's enough of that. I'm out of here.",

        "Mr. Knightly: Well, our admissions office was quite impressed with your essays. But we'd like to know a little more about your career goals.",
        "Coop: Well, I've always wanted to travel the world, learn as much as I can about other cultures, so that I can use that and incorporate it into my writing.",
        "Mr. Knightly: You want to write non-fiction then?",
        "Coop: Or historical novels. I've kind of always wanted to teach, too, although a lot of that's up in the air right now.",

        "Mr. Knightly: I understand that. But what we look for amongst our applicants in qualities is focus.",
        "Ava: Focus. Oh, yes, Coop is... oh, he's incredibly focused and driven, too. Oh, did you... did you tell him how you would sell your soul to study under any of those writers in the brochure? Going to Oxford is all Coop has ever talked about since the day I met him.",

        "Coop: You mean the dates?",
        "Mr. Knightly: The workshop is an all-intensive experience which spans over several months. No breaks or holidays to speak of. The professors will expect you to be 100% invested in your classes. Not much time for socializing or a home life. Is that acceptable?",

        "Jonathan: Oh, boy.",
        "Tammy: Hmm. From this moment on I'm burning away the past. All of our lies and misunderstandings and lack of trust, itr burning all of it. From this moment on, we're one. As that thing burns, it burns away the past and all the bad stuff that goes along with it, and you're mine and I'm yours forever. Nothing and nobody can come between us.",

        "Lizzie: Oh, there's got to be somebody that can help me. I mean, how much would it take to find somebody that could help me prove that I was already pregnant before April 10? What's the big deal, anyway? I mean, it could have been either day. I'm just choosing the earlier one. ( Sighs ) From now on, all April 10 is going to represent is the Springfield Flower Festival. Who am I going to get to back me up on that?",

        "Dinah: I know that you're worried about Gus, but you know what I'm real happy about? That you're finally noticing that Dinah Marler really exists.",

        "Dinah: You know, it's always something wrong with me, isn't it? You know what? You go on, you go handle Gus, you go handle your family, you go solve one or two cases while you're at it with Mallet. But I'll just... I'll let you know that I'm here. Okay? I'm here until you're good and ready to give me five minutes, not that you ever even have five minutes to give.",
        "Harley: Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm here. I'm listening.",
        "Dinah: You know what? You are the one that needs a little break, Harley. You're the one who has to get her life in order. You're the one who needs a vacation. And I just want you to know I will be here watching your back, making sure that Alan's not going to come over you, that Alan-Michael's not doing his thing. And I'll be here making the press conferences, making the meetings, and you can flip my switch because here I am, the walking, talking corporate doormat! Is that who I am to you?",
        "Harley: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, I don't know who you've been talking to, but I appreciate everything that you do-- for me and the company. And I would never think of you as a doormat, never. What is this about?",
        "Dinah: This is about how much I've done for you. I have done a lot for you. And what am I to you? Am I some little worker for you? No, you... you have not given me a promotion, you have not given me more responsibility, you haven't given me jack. But you know what you've done? You have demoted me and you slept with my boyfriend on top of it!",

        "Gus: ( Sighs ) He's an airplane mechanic, not a meth freak. I get that he is a mechanic on Ross Marler's plane, okay? But if you ask me, we got ourselves a bum lead here.",
        "Mallet: His name is John Anderson. John Anderson. That doesn't sound like an alias to you?",
        "Gus: Hello, Mr. Anderson. I think you should start the car. We're wasting our time.",
        "Mallet: Do you think you're drinking a little bit too much coffee there, bub?",

        "Coop: Yes, but why hasn't Lizzie contacted me yet? Usually she calls me back within five seconds of me leaving a message.",
        "Ava: Well, maybe she doesn't have any answers for you. Listen, I'm so sorry that I was such a weirdo with the guy from Oxford. It's just that I felt like he needed to know what a great guy you are.",
        "Coop: No, no, please. Thank you for stopping me from being honest about everything right now. It's because of you I still have options if...",
        "Ava: If... if the pregnancy is a total lie, which I hope it is. Oxford is all you've ever wanted.",
        "Coop: Well, Oxford isn't all I want. But as soon as I find out the truth about what is going on with Lizzie, I'll know what to do then.",

We are going to live in a big house, just you, me, Henry, and a little... whoever. Do you like that idea? Huh? Do you like it? I do, too. I love that idea. Oh, I'm so excited. Aren't you? And no one is going to find out that anybody but Coop could be the father. I will make sure of that.",

        "Jonathan: You make me happy, Tammy. It's a weird feeling for me and... I don't know, I like it, though. I like it. I want to feel it every day. You're the first person that, um, chose me and without you...",
        "Tammy: Hey, Jonathan. You're never going to be without me, okay?",
        "Jonathan: Listen. Without you, I'd be worthless. So I'll do anything, anything to keep it, to keep you forever.",

        "Harley: No, Mallet and I, Mallet and I-- we regretted it that day. That day, we regretted it. He loves you. He loves only you. And as for work, you don't know how much I value you.",
        "Dinah: You know what? I'll tell you something. I don't know, what do you value, Harley? Do you value the fact that I make your coffee good? You know, that I'm a busy little worker bee? I don't get it. I mean, what do you think that it takes to make me sane there? I... you're not even seeing me. ( Phone ringing ) You know, you... you think it's okay that you stomped all over our friendship and slept with my boyfriend because, I don't know, is that what happens to Dinah? She always loses, so it doesn't matter. Don't pick up the phone!",
