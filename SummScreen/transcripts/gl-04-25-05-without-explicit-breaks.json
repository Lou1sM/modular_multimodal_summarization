        "Dinah: Thank you. Well, it's funny how things work out for the best, right?",
        "Cassie: You're going to have to explain that one to me.",
        "Dinah: Well, you know, i mean, if edmund hadn't made me pretend I was sick, the doctor wouldn't have checked me out, and, you know, it could have been a month or a week before we knew anything.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, it's nice how lies and manipulation pay off, huh?",

        "Vanessa: Oh, I'm fortifying myself for a mission.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that sounds important.",
        "Vanessa: It is, very important. My daughter's life could depend on it.",
        "Josh: Hey, hey, stop that. ( Laughter ) hey, darling, how are you?",
        "Tammy: Hey. I thought you and aunt reva were planning to be away for a while.",
        "Josh: Yeah, well, I had to come back early. I have a meeting here in town tomorrow. Reva decided to stay in aspen for a bit, though. She's trying to get a good feel for the town before we start breaking ground on our new vacation home.",
        "Sandy: Ooh.",
        "Josh: Yeah. ( Laughs )",
        "Sandy: Well, you almost came home to some really good news.",
        "Josh: Oh, yeah?",
        "Sandy: Jonathan almost left town.",
        "Josh: Why?",
        "Tammy: We don't know.",
        "Darla: Think it's that easy to get rid of me? Hang up on darla and she'll disappear?",
        "Jonathan: What are you doing here, darla?",
        "Darla: You shouldn't avoid our calls, johnny boy. We're not very happy with you.",
        "Mallet: Harley? Are you all right?",
        "Harley: I remembered something. Something from the night of the murder that I didn't remember before. Up until now, all I could remember was struggling with phillip and that I hit the ground.",
        "Mallet: Yeah? Well, what is it? Do you remember picking up a gun, or do you remember...",
        "Harley: I have to call gus.",
        "Mallet: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Absolutely not.",
        "Harley: Mallet, I promise. Let me make this one last phone call, and then that's it. No more favors. I will tow the line. What if what I remembered helps prove I'm innocent?",
        "Mallet: All right. Tell me. I'll help you.",
        "Harley: No, you're not...",
        "Mallet: I'm not what? Trustworthy?",
        "Harley: You're not.",
        "Mallet: Listen, harley, let me in on this, and I'll pursue it.",
        "Harley: Because you believe i didn't do it.",
        "Mallet: Because nothing would make me happier than to see you walk out of this place a free woman.",
        "Harley: Then why won't you let me call gus?",
        "Gus: ( Groans ) talk about a hangover. ( Groans ) where the hell am I? Hey! Open this door! No phone.",
        "Josh: Well, if jonathan needs a ride, I'd certainly be happy to drive him to the airport.",
        "Sandy: I offered, too.",
        "Tammy: Well, he's not going. I think we convinced him to stay, at least for now.",
        "Josh: You convinced him to stay?",
        "Tammy: He was going to leave without saying good-bye to aunt reva. She would be hurt.",
        "Josh: Maybe that's part of his big plan. You know, come to town, make her feel guilty until she can't stand it anymore, then leave town without saying good- bye so she knows that she's failed him once again. It's nice, don't you think?",
        "Sandy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Tammy: I don't think so. I don't think it's a plan at all. He seemed, I don't know, freaked.",
        "Josh: Yeah, well, I noticed that before I left. Something tells me that's not a good thing.",
        "Jonathan: Deal's off. I'M... I'm out.",
        "Darla: Not so fast, johnny.",
        "Jonathan: Look, it's done, okay? I'm not living at home, I can't get a job...",
        "Darla: You were doing so well for a while. You knew this was going to be tough when you signed on. You can't stop now.",
        "Jonathan: And yet, that's what I'm doing, okay? Adios, springfield.",
        "Darla: You won't get far. You know the ground rules. There's no way out. I'd hate to see you try.",
        "Cassie: I'm not jealous of you, dinah. I'm just trying to wrap my mind around what you and edmund did, and I'm having a really hard time.",
        "Dinah: Okay. All right, come on. Let's go. Let it out.",
        "Cassie: Shut up.",
        "Dinah: Look, you are putting on an awesome act, let me tell you. But I know why you're hovering over me: Because you want to be as big of a part of this pregnancy as I am.",
        "Cassie: I am a big part of this pregnancy. I'm that child's mother. Don't forget that.",
        "Dinah: I don'T. And I knew what I was getting myself into when I agreed to carry your child. But you know what? This is not your choice.",
        "Cassie: No, it wasn't my choice.",
        "Dinah: No. And you know what? Yes, you have been doing a great job at it, and I cannot imagine how hard it's going to be to know that the baby is kicking inside of me, I'm feeling that baby grow, and you can't feel it.",
        "Cassie: You know what? If you do everything that you're supposed to do, I'm going to be fine, dinah. I'm going to be better than fine.",
        "Dinah: I know that. You know why? Because we're in this together, okay? It's going to be great. It's going to work out.",
        "Cassie: You know what, dinah? It's not great. Okay? It's not great. I hate the fact that I have to look at you, let alone take care of you while you're carrying my child. I hate it.",
        "Dinah: Good. Good. There you go. You just admitted the truth. Do you feel better?",
        "Jeffrey: Snap out of it, o'neill.",
        "Dinah: Well, you know what? Now you know how it feels to be me. Generally, I'm the one watching you get everything I want.",
        "Cassie: You know what? I'm going to get some air.",
        "Dinah: You know something? I wanted to be you. I wanted to be you for so long. I wanted your life and I wanted your kids. I wanted to be you so badly, i was you.",
        "Cassie: Don't remind me.",
        "Dinah: But it never occurred to me that I actually would have something that you would want.",
        "Cassie: So, is it edmund that you want so badly, dinah?",
        "Dinah: You really need to get past your jealousy.",
        "Cassie: ( Laughs ) I'm not jealous of you. Okay? I'm not. And I don't doubt edmund's feelings for me at all. I'm just trying to figure out where you stand.",
        "Dinah: I don't want to have this child so that edmund could love me. I did this to put my life back together again. And I owe you. I owe both of you.",
        "Cassie: ]Eah, me. You do. What do you owe edmund?",
        "Dinah: He was my friend when I came to this town, when I was the town pariah. And let's just say, I'm trying to return a favor to some people I hurt very badly.",
        "Cassie: So it's that easy, huh?",
        "Dinah: I don't see why not. This baby can heal everything for us. ( Knock on door ) I'll get it. Mom?",
        "Vanessa: Yup, in the flesh. And not a moment too soon.",
        "Josh: I wish I could enjoy this. I wish I could find pleasure in watching jonathan squirm, but...",
        "Sandy: No one's stopping you.",
        "Josh: Yeah, but, you know, he's reva's son, and she's worried about him, and blah, blah, blah. So...",
        "Tammy: Listen, I'm not saying that we really have to care. I'm just saying that we should make sure whatever he's got going on doesn't jump up and bite us.",
        "Josh: Yeah, but either way, reva will kill me if I don't do everything I can to keep him from leaving town. I mean, it's crazy, but I have to figure out a way to stop him from going. ( Laughter )",
        "Sandy: Good luck with that.",
        "Josh: Well, thank you. I do have an idea, though. Unfortunately, if it works, you're going to hate it, and so am I.",
        "Jonathan: There's nothing you can do to me.",
        "Darla: No? You don't think the cops would like to know you came to town with a backpack full of drugs ready to peddle to high school kiddies during recess?",
        "Jonathan: Don't threaten me.",
        "Darla: I'm just the messenger.",
        "Jonathan: More like the hatchet man.",
        "Darla: You know what your problem is? You've been in this town alone too long, with that family, your mommy. You're getting soft, attached to people. Big mistake. We have work to do.",
        "Jonathan: I know. Okay?",
        "Josh: Jonathan? Got a minute?",
        "Mallet: I'm doing everything I can to protect you right now.",
        "Harley: By shutting me off from the one person who could actually clear my name?",
        "Mallet: Harley, you're in prison, and I'm keeping you safe.",
        "Harley: Thank you for protecting me. You're my hero. You feel better now?",
        "Mallet: Not really.",
        "Harley: Okay. Okay, mallet, mallet. You could be a hero, really, if you would let me call my lawyer.",
        "Mallet: Tell me what you just remembered about the night phillip was murdered. Harley, I was a good cop. You know that.",
        "Harley: Well, so was I.",
        "Mallet: Yes. Yes. And I trained you. Come on. Try remembering some of the good stuff and trusting that I can still be that same guy. I can help you. You were the best partner I ever had.",
        "Harley: Well, you're not the best partner I ever had. That would be gus.",
        "Mallet: Gus never lied to you, huh?",
        "Harley: I trust him.",
        "Mallet: But not me?",
        "Harley: No, not you.",
        "Mallet: That's okay. Gus isn't here. I am. He can't help you anymore.",
        "Gus: Thank god for holes. All right. Pull the macgyver up the middle trick and spring this baby.",
        "Distorted voice: Give it up, mr. Aitoro. You're not going anywhere. You're going to be here for a long, long time, unless you do exactly what I say. Coming up on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Jeffrey: Wait. Would you care to join me for a drink, mrs. Winslow?",
        "Cassie: I would love to.",

        "Vanessa: You look very well, sweetheart.",
        "Dinah: Well, I guess you know about the baby, huh?",
        "Vanessa: Yes, I know about the baby. Your father called me.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, of course he did. Well, you know what? I'll give you an update. I'm doing great. I'm feeling wonderful. Cassie and edmund are taking very good care of me.",
        "Vanessa: Oh, I'm sure they are. But you know, I sort of had to come to see for myself. It's a lot to take in all at once.",
        "Cassie: Glad I'm not the only one who thinks so.",
        "Vanessa: Thank you. Well, come. Tell me everything-- how you're feeling, what the doctor says. Have you had an ultrasound yet? Well, this is lovely.",
        "Cassie: Edmund bought that.",
        "Vanessa: He did?",
        "Cassie: Yes, he did.",
        "Vanessa: Where are your other children?",
        "Cassie: They're away.",
        "Dinah: Um, you know what? Cassie, don't feel like you need to entertain us. We're going to be fine.",
        "Cassie: I'm going to go out. I'll head over to the beacon and check some things out, all right?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, that's good. Just... you take a break.",
        "Cassie: Call me if you need anything.",
        "Dinah: Thank you. Cassie's been amazing about this whole thing.",
        "Vanessa: Oh, really? The two of you are getting along?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Actually, we are. It was her idea that I live here, which I think was really a great idea, and they've been making me feel at home, so...",
        "Vanessa: You can lie to cassie, dinah. You can lie to yourself if you have to. But you can't lie to me. This is crazy. This is absolute madness. And I came here to make you see that.",
        "Josh: How are you doing, jonathan? You going to introduce me to your friend here?",
        "Darla: We just met. I was asking him for directions, and he was kind enough to give them to me.",
        "Josh: Ah.",
        "Darla: Your son?",
        "Josh: My stepson.",
        "Darla: Well. Nice to meet you.",
        "Josh: Nice to meet you.",
        "Darla: Thanks for the directions.",
        "Josh: Looked like the two of you were having a very intense conversation.",

        "Josh: ( Laughs )",
        "Jonathan: We were bargaining the price.",
        "Josh: I guess my timing was bad then, huh?",
        "Jonathan: That's okay. Plenty more where she came from. So when did you get back from aspen?",
        "Josh: Just now.",
        "Jonathan: Where's reva?",
        "Josh: She decided to stay there for a bit.",

        "Jonathan: Yeah. All right. See you.",
        "Josh: Just a second.",
        "Jonathan: What, don't tell me you want that hooker's phone number?",
        "Josh: ( Laughs ) no, thank you. You came to me looking for a job a while ago. I told you I'd think about it. I've thought about it. You got the job. Welcome to lewis construction.",
        "Jonathan: I'm sorry, i changed my mind. You keep your job.",
        "Cassie: Just the man I was looking for.",
        "Jeffrey: What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be looking after dinah, tucking her in at the farm or something?",
        "Cassie: Uh, I was. And then her mother showed up, and I don't really care for vanessa, and she doesn't care for me, either, so...",
        "Jeffrey: Her mother.",
        "Cassie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jeffrey: Classy type, wearing a brown jacket?",
        "Cassie: That's her.",
        "Jeffrey: I should have known. Well, that's just what you need, huh? More stress?",
        "Cassie: Yes.",
        "Jeffrey: So is mama dinah going to sleep over at the farm, too?",
        "Cassie: ( Laughs ) no. We're full. Plus rj and will are coming home.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, at least that's something you can look forward to, right?",
        "Cassie: Yes, it is.",
        "Jeffrey: I don't know how you do it.",
        "Cassie: I don't know how you do it. What is this? What are you working on? Show me.",
        "Jeffrey: It'S... well, it's a double homicide, huh, and a robbery. Nice guy.",
        "Cassie: Wow.",
        "Jeffrey: You should marry him.",
        "Cassie: It's big stuff. Let me see. So I guess I'm interrupting, huh?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. I was wondering when you were going to come to that conclusion.",
        "Cassie: So, I should probably go and let you get on with it.",
        "Jeffrey: Yup.",
        "Cassie: Oh.",
        "Jeffrey: Very busy.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Well, I'm going to go.",

        "Jeffrey: Wait. Would you care to join me for a drink, mrs. Winslow?",
        "Cassie: I would love to.",
        "Harley: What is the harm in me calling gus?",
        "Mallet: Because gus is the reason you're in here. He's the reason you got caught up with the spauldings again. He didn't stop you when you went to war with phillip. And during your trial, his mistakes cost you everything.",
        "Harley: That is not true.",
        "Mallet: Oh, it's true. Let me tell you, I met him, okay? Nice guy. I met him. I'm sure he really cares about you. He's all over the place. He's all over the place. Every time he tries to help you, it just makes things worse.",
        "Harley: Sounds like someone i used to know.",
        "Mallet: Listen, I may never be able to make up for what i did to you.",
        "Harley: I don't care about that right now.",
        "Mallet: Then let me help you.",
        "Harley: Sorry. Not interested.",
        "Mallet: Not interested? Okay. Fine.",

        "Mallet: Take the prisoner back to her cell.",
        "Guard: Yes, sir.",
        "Gus: Who are you? What's it going to take for me to get out of here, huh? ( Grunts ) are we negotiating here, or what?",
        "Distorted voice: We'll see.",
        "Gus: Well, if this is about money, you picked a pretty lousy time. I don't think my father's going to go for paying up any ransom.",
        "Distorted voice: It's not the money.",
        "Gus: Oh, that's good. That's good, because those things never work out. Take it from me, I'm a cop. Listen, I'll tell you what. Just.. if you let me go, I'll forget about this whole thing, huh?",
        "Distorted voice: I can't do",
        "Gus: Oh, yes you can. Come on.",
        "Distorted voice: This is a matter of life and death. The sooner you understand that, mr. Aitoro, the better.",
        "Lena: Hm. You were in that warden's office a long time, huh?",
        "Harley: Too long.",
        "Lena: Did he make a pass at you?",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Lena: Disappointed, huh?",
        "Harley: Lena, what is wrong with you?",
        "Lena: Well, you know, a little romance in this place could make it a little easier.",
        "Harley: Not for me.",
        "Lena: You know what your problem is?",
        "Harley: My problem?",
        "Lena: You keep everything inside. It's not healthy for you.",
        "Harley: I just need to sleep.",
        "Lena: Okay. There's always tomorrow, you know? We can talk then. It'll be all right.",
        "Harley: Better still, wake me in 15 years.",
        "Lena: ( Laughs ) I wish it was that easy, honey.",
        "Harley: Yeah. Me, too.",
        "Gus: It's okay. I'm here.",
        "Harley: I'm so scared. I don't know who to trust anymore.",
        "Gus: You trust me. I'll take care of you, and i won't let you down this time. I promise. Whose life and death are we talking about?",
        "Distorted voice: I think you know.",
        "Gus: Phillip. His life and death. Ah. And it's my investigation, right?",
        "Distorted voice: Why don't you tell me about your investigation?",
        "Gus: There's nothing to tell you. See, I loved the girl, and i tried to prove that she was innocent, and it didn't pan out, so I just... I dropped her, and then I droppedy investigation. I'm just trying to get on with my life.",
        "Distorted voice: Liar.",
        "Gus: I got too close to the truth, didn't I?",
        "Distorted voice: Leave it alone.",
        "Gus: That's why I'm in here, right? Huh? Because you had to stop me before I nailed the real killer.",
        "Distorted voice: I told you, leave it alone.",
        "Gus: ( Chuckles ) it's you, isn't it? Huh? You killed my brother, and you're letting harley pay for it. So what's next, huh? You going to kill me, too?",
        "Josh: Jonathan, a while ago, you were anxious. You wanted to prove yourself in the family business. What happened?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, well, you know me. I just jump on whatever interests me at the moment, and I decided that a nine-to-five grind just wasn't for me.",
        "Josh: I see.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, plus sandy and tammy were trying to call me out, and I just felt like proving a point, so... I'm over that now.",
        "Josh: I think I didn't hire you right away, so now you're blowing me off.",
        "Jonathan: Well, I do have some pride. Why are you doing this, josh?",
        "Josh: It would mean a lot to your mom. We both know that. Then again, I'm not going to beg, so you do what you want.",
        "Jonathan: Uh, well, say hi to mom for me.",
        "Tammy: Hi. Hello?",
        "Jonathan: Not tonight, tam- tam.",
        "Tammy: So do you think he's staying or going?",
        "Jonathan: Like I said, who cares?",
        "Darla: Excuse me, I don't mean to butt in.",
        "Sandy: No problem.",
        "Darla: I just had to tell you how pretty you are. Have you ever thought about modeling?",
        "Tammy: No, never. I mean, I took some acting classes, and I was in my cousin's fashion show once, but that's about it.",
        "Darla: I have friends who could do wonders with you.",
        "Jonathan: Hey! Don't touch her! Get the hell out of here!",
        "Jeffrey: They pour a healthy drink here.",
        "Cassie: ( Laughs )",
        "Jeffrey: So, what's the real reason you're here? Not that I'm complaining.",
        "Cassie: I need an impartial opinion.",
        "Jeffrey: Great.",
        "Cassie: Really, I do. It's important.",
        "Jeffrey: Go ahead, shoot.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Why do you think dinah really agreed to carry my child?",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, no. No, no. No.",
        "Cassie: Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Because you are the dinah expert, okay? You're the one who slept with her.",
        "Jeffrey: You know, I was having a nice evening, doing my work...",
        "Cassie: Okay. I'm sorry. I am sorry. Your opinion means a lot to me.",
        "Jeffrey: It's pretty obvious why dinah's carrying this child. It's to get at you.",
        "Cassie: Ross said that she's in love with edmund.",
        "Jeffrey: Really? This week?",
        "Cassie: She ever say anything to you about being in love with edmund or having feelings for edmund?",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie, I haven't talked to dinah in a long time, okay. I don't know what she's feeling. But I can guarantee you, whatever she's doing, it's to get at you.",
        "Cassie: I hate this. I hate that I have to sit around analyzing dinah's next move, wondering the next time she's going to stab me in the back. And you know what? As much as I hate that she's here, maybe-- just maybe-- vanessa can whip her into shape.",
        "Vanessa: So you're living in the house that was meant for you, and you're living with the woman that you hate, you've always hated, and you're carrying her child.",
        "Dinah: Yup.",
        "Vanessa: I really wish that your life were just a little less complicated.",
        "Dinah: I think I'm a little past complicated. So I imagine you've talked to dad. Did he tell you I've lost my mind? Because if he had it his way, I'd probably be off to ravenwood by now.",
        "Vanessa: Dinah, can we talk about this? Can we really talk about this, please?",
        "Dinah: Daddy does not understand, and I expect that. But you, more than anybody, understands the hell I've been through. And the hell I've caused other people. I saw a chance to change that, to make up for all the wrong that I caused people, to become a better person, and I took it. I am doing the right thing here.",
        "Vanessa: For whom, darling?",
        "Dinah: You know what? I'm being selfish. I know that. But I am trying to make people see that I am making a sacrifice here, that I am a caring person, that I can do this. And I'm getting a little tired of everybody seeing me the way i used to be.",
        "Vanessa: What are you talking about?",
        "Dinah: I have changed. Europe changed me. I've changed. I want you to believe that.",
        "Vanessa: I would really love to believe that. And I'M... I'm proud of you for thinking of other people and for trying to do the right thing. I am.",
        "Dinah: And you know something? I'm glad you're here. I'm glad you're here, but I need you now. I am becoming a mother, and I'm having a baby.",
        "Vanessa: Yeah. Well, I'm very glad that your father called me, and I do have an idea that I think might help some people, especially you. And you are my main concern, my love.",
        "Dinah: Thank you. What's your idea?",
        "Vanessa: I want you to pack your bags, and I want you to leave this town with me tonight.",
        "Darla: Keep your hands off me.",
        "Sandy: What the hell's going on here?",
        "Jonathan: She's a madam. She keeps a lot of hookers.",
        "Tammy: What?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. She propositioned me outside.",
        "Darla: Liar. I'm legit. Just looking for talent.",
        "Tammy: I'm not interested.",
        "Sandy: Well, you heard her. Get going before we have to call the cops.",
        "Darla: Looks like I'm outnumbered-- for now.",
        "Tammy: Do you know her?",
        "Jonathan: Shouldn't you be in the library studying or something?",
        "Sandy: She's with me.",
        "Jonathan: Well, then take her home and do whatever you celibates do after the big date-- I don't know, read the zodiac to each other.",
        "Tammy: Why are you acting so strange?",
        "Jonathan: What, is this the thanks I get from saving you from a life in the brothel?",
        "Tammy: You're acting freaked.",
        "Sandy: Yeah. What, did you have a run-in with josh outside, or...",
        "Jonathan: No. He offered me a job.",
        "Josh: Yeah. We're not done with that conversation yet, jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, I came in here to have a drink, not a family reunion.",
        "Josh: Ever since you came to springfield, you've been running wild, no focus whatsoever. Finally you decided to come work for me. Now, what's the problem? What, are you afraid that you won't be able to handle it?",
        "Jonathan: Fine. I'm in. Okay? When do I start?",
        "Dinah: It's a little late to try to fix me, mom. You know what? You should have thought of that before you gave me away to that bearded lady at the carnival.",
        "Vanessa: Stop. You can't use that excuse anymore, dinah. Your daddy and I have been in your life for years. We're on your side.",
        "Dinah: Really? My side? You tried to deport me to italy. Remember?",
        "Vanessa: I want you with me. I did when we tried that. I still do. Look, you remember when hart died? I was on your side. I was trying to protect you, and I always will.",
        "Dinah: On your terms, always on your terms. I want you to understand how important this baby is to me.",
        "Vanessa: I understand. More than anybody, I understand. It's what it's going to do to you that I'm worried about. You carry a child for nine months. You give birth to the child, and then you hand the baby to a woman that you hate? Have you thought about what that's going to be like? You've got to get ready for that. You've got to prepare. I want you to come back with me, and I want you to see a counselor, and I'll go with you.",
        "Dinah: A counselor? What are you talking about? Why do you talk to me like I'm crazy?",
        "Cassie: What's going on?",
        "Vanessa: My daughter and i are talking.",
        "Cassie: Well, your daughter is carrying my child, so they're my concern now.",
        "Vanessa: ( Scoffs ) I wish I believed that.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, maybe you can talk about that some other time.",
        "Cassie: Are you okay?",
        "Dinah: No, I'm not okay, because she wants me to go back to italy is what's happening.",
        "Cassie: No. That's not going to happen. You can check back after the baby's born.",
        "Vanessa: I know what's best for my child.",
        "Cassie: I know what's best for mine. That's why I'm taking out a restraining order against you and ross.",
        "Vanessa: What did you say?",
        "Cassie: Tell her.",
        "Jeffrey: We started the paperwork tonight, yes.",
        "Vanessa: ( Gasps ) that is a very big mistake, cassie.",
        "Cassie: I don't think so. And I'm going to do whatever it takes to protect my child, and right now that means protecting dinah. So I want you out of my house. I want you out now, vanessa.",
        "Dinah: Mom, please.",
        "Vanessa: All right, I'll go. This is not over, cassie.",
        "Lena: Nights are the hardest, you know. Here. Because all you've got is time to think. Hey, you know what? Talk to me. Come on. My calendar is wide open, and i work on a sliding scale kind of thing, so... you know what? You could talk to me. Come on. Talk.",
        "Harley: I remember something about the night that phillip died, and I don't want to tell mallet, but I'm having second thoughts about telling gus.",
        "Lena: Okay. Well, you could tell me, and maybe I could help you decide what to do. Harley, you can trust me. I've got a daughter. Don't you think I want to believe if my daughter was alone that somebody would come along and help her? Right? Outside the warden's office, and I smelled flowers-- jasmine, i think. Something very distinctive like that. It reminded me of a woman's perfume. And I remembered being outside company and hearing footsteps, high heels.",
        "Lena: Right.",
        "Harley: And smelling that jasmine the night that phillip was murdered. I don't remember anything else about her. I don't remember her face, nothing. But my intuition tells me she's the one who killed phillip. I'm sorry. I know that's a lot to share with you, but...",
        "Lena: No, no, no, no, no, no. It's fine, really. Remember, I can keep a secret. I'm thinking maybe you shouldn't tell anybody this, you know, until you kind of start to remember more about this mystery woman.",
        "Harley: Oh, lena, I don'T...",
        "Lena: I don't even think you should tell this gus guy. What are you going to do? Send him out on some stupid wild goose chase to every perfume counter this side of chicago? You know what they do there? They spritz you with all those testers. You know how guys hate that. ( Laughter )",
        "Harley: Yeah, maybe you're right.",
        "Lena: You know, the one thing we have in here is time-- time to think, time to remember. And if I were you, I'd be wise about that.",
        "Harley: You're right. I'm going to keep quiet.",
        "Lena: Okay.",
        "Harley: For now.",
        "Lena: Okay. Good. Yeah.",
        "Gus: I'm going to bury you for what you're doing to harley.",
        "Distorted voice: You are in no position to threaten.",
        "Gus: Well, you're not going to get away with this. I'm not the only one working on phillip's investigation. The others, they'll find you. Do whatever you want to do to me.",
        "Distorted voice: I don't want to hurt you, mr. Aitoro. Call off the investigation, and we won't have a problem.",
        "Gus: No! No!",
        "Distorted voice: You do it, or harley cooper is a dead woman. We can get to her any time we want. Next, on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Dinah: Is that it? Is that all you're going to say, cassie? I mean, edmund has practically been accused of a crime here, and you're not even defending him.",
        "Cassie: I want everybody out right now.",
        "Michelle: I came back here because I'm looking for danny, and I need to tell him that i love him.",
        "Tony: What about me, hm? Do you love me?"
