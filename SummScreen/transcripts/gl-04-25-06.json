        "Josh, Cassie and RJ find H.B.'s old desk in an antique shop. Inside the desk Josh finds H.B.'s blueprints for a privately funded medical center for soldiers. He talks with the owner of the land, Buck, about turning Cross Creek into a ranch-style medical center and Buck refuses. Josh asks Cassie to, \"Use your past\", to get the guy to agree. Thinking Josh meant her past as a hooker, she blasts him, but Buck leaves, agreeing to the project. They shake hands on a deal for the project. Dinah and Harley arrive at the shooting scene. Mallet has been shot and Gus just stares into space, having difficulty focusing. He has flashbacks of taking pills prior to the stakeout. Gus and Mallet give conflicting reports about exactly what happened. Harley tells Gus that she knows he is high and that she knows he didn't have a deposition with the nurse. She is irate that Gus endangered himself and Mallet. A very contrite Gus finally admits that, \"I needed to take them, I needed to\". A very devastated Gus realizes he needs help and Harley agrees to help him as she takes him in for rehab treatment. Mallet is treated for a shoulder wound at Cedars while a worried Dinah stands by his side. The only thing she can do for Mallet is donate blood, but passes out as the nurse comes with the syringes and needles. When she comes to, Rick announces that Mallet is going to be o.k. and that Mallet told him to tell her he loved her.",
        "Lizzie asks a so-called friend who works for her uncle-doctor, an OB-GYN, to fabricate that Lizzie has been a patient of his for a while. Coop follows her to the office, suspicious of her. Coop asks to see Lizzie's medical records and the friend tells him that Lizzie has been a patient for a month. He leaves thinking Lizzie is an established patient. At Company, Olivia tries to get Frank and Buzz back on speaking terms and Frank receives a call about an officer shot. She tells an emotional story to Buzz about when her father was killed in a freak accident as a police officer. Lizzie and Coop walk into Company and tell Ava they need to talk as Alan and Beth walk in. Lizzie announces to a shocked audience that she and Henry are pregnant. Alan attacks Coop, choking him."

        "Josh: Wow.",
        "Cassie: It's here. It's here, and it looks great.",
        "Josh: It's so much smaller than I remember it being. I don't even know how he got his legs under here.",
        "Cassie: You want me to help you move it against the wall or something?",
        "Josh: I think we need to clean it up a little bit, you know, dust it, something like that.",
        "Cassie: Olivia should be shot for selling this.",
        "Josh: You know what, I'm just glad that we have it.",
        "R.J.: Is this your dad's?",
        "Josh: Yeah, yeah. This is the desk that H.B. was sitting at when he started Lewis Oil. You want to sit down, huh, give it a test run? There you go. ( Laughs ) Pretty cool, huh?",
        "Cassie: Careful.",
        "R.J.: Mom?",
        "Josh: Hang on. Step back just a little bit.",
        "Cassie: What are they?",
        "Josh: Something I didn't expect that I'd ever see again.",

        "Lizzie: Hello?",
        "Coop: Lizzie, it's me.",
        "Lizzie: Coop, hey, I was just going to call you. Guess what? The baby just kicked.",
        "Coop: Are you sure? That's impossible. You're not that far along yet.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, well, I felt something. I'm sure I did.",
        "Coop: Look, we need to talk.",
        "Lizzie: When?",
        "Coop: Now. I'm...",
        "Lizzie: I can't. I told my mom that I was going to baby-sit James. So, maybe later?",
        "Coop: I'll come to the house then.",
        "Lizzie: No.",
        "Coop: Why not?",
        "Lizzie: Because we wouldn't be all alone. I mean, James would be all over you to play that game that he's always playing. I will call you later. Okay? All right, bye, sweetie.",
        "Coop: Lizzie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Ava? When you have the chance, I've got a private party.",
        "Ava: Oh, sure.",
        "Buzz: This is a baby shower. We have them all the time.",
        "Ava: Yeah, I know.",
        "Buzz: You have something against babies?",
        "Ava: No, I love babies. It's just that any idiot can have one. You have to go through more to adopt a dog or to drive a car than to become a parent. It just makes me crazy.",
        "Buzz: Okay.",
        "Ava: I won't mention it during the shower.",
        "Buzz: Thanks for that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: No, no, no. I really don't want to do this right now.",
        "Olivia: We're on the date.",
        "Frank: This isn't something, Olivia, that you do on a date, though.",
        "Olivia: Well, it is if you want another one. Frank, please. I don't want to be in the middle of this. You and your father need to sit down and hash this out. Okay, at least sit down with him.",
        "Frank: Olivia, I know you mean well.",
        "Olivia: One of the things I love about us, Frank, is that it started so nice. I don't want to be the woman who tears up the Cooper family. Please. ( Cell phone rings ) Don't answer that.",
        "Frank: I'm sorry.",
        "Olivia: You need to talk...",
        "Frank: I've got to take this. Copper here. What? I'm on my way. There has been a shooting. One of my men are down. I'll call you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Officer: Coop, wait, wait.",
        "Dinah: Let her go, let her go, let her go. He's been shot.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, don't remind me, huh?",
        "Harley: How bad is it? Tell me.",
        "Mallet: It looks worse than it is. It's all right. We've got to let these guys do their job, okay?",
        "Harley: Are you all right?",
        "Gus: I'm fine.",
        "Harley: You're not fine. You are white as a sheet. You're trembling. You are not fine. Hey, look at me. What's going on?",
        "Buzz: I thought that was you. Why didn't you come in?",
        "Olivia: I was going to.",
        "Buzz: But?",
        "Olivia: I don't know, I changed my mind.",
        "Buzz: You thought Frank would find us together.",
        "Olivia: No, he was here.",
        "Buzz: Was?",
        "Olivia: One of his officers was shot.",
        "Buzz: Who?",
        "Olivia: I don't know. My dad was in the army. He was an officer. He trained recruits.",
        "Buzz: I think you told me about that.",
        "Olivia: Yeah. He used to drive my mother crazy. She worried about him. Dad told her that she was too nervous, you know, that nothing was going to happen to him. But I don't think it helped much. I could tell because about the time that he was supposed to come home from work, I would find her sitting alone in the living room pretending to read a magazine. But then, you know, at 6:15 my dad would roll in, he'd come through the screen door, and she'd perk up and say, \"hi, honey,\" and he'd kiss her on the cheek. And then she would leave the room, go into the kitchen or whatever. He would plop himself in front of the tv. And a lot of time neither one of them said a word to each other for the rest of the night.",
        "Buzz: That sounds like marriage.",
        "Olivia: I found out later that when they were first married, my dad had been shot. Some kind of accident on the firing range. And then when I was a freshman in high school, it happened again. A weird, freak accident. And he dies. And just like that, life changed. And I know this sounds crazy, but I think that's when I started to expect the worst; probably even made it happen. But it just changed. It changed, Buzz.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Hey, hey, hey, hey.",
        "Gus: You're going to be okay.",
        "Mallet: Yeah. What's a little hole in the arm, right? The guy was a lousy shot.",
        "Dinah: A lousy shot, he hit him.",
        "Mallet: He was aiming for Gus.",
        "Harley: Mallet, what happened?",
        "Gus: The guy was going into his car and he saw us and he just freaked out...",
        "Mallet: He freaked, yeah, but he was heading to his car. He was coming into the garage.",
        "Gus: He was heading to... from the car.",
        "Harley: Okay, okay. So, what happened? Then you approached him?",
        "Gus: Well, we wanted to show our I.D.'s to the guy and to talk to the guy.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, but we didn't show our I.D.'s, man, he made us for cops right away...",
        "Gus: He showed his I.D...",
        "Mallet: No. I didn't... remember he started shooting as soon as I got out of the car.",
        "Gus: The point is, the guy got away...",
        "Dinah: I don't understand what happened, do you? I don't get it.",
        "Gus: We just wanted to talk to him. We're going to talk to him.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, he's right. We didn't know we were going to become target practice.",
        "Officer: Look, we're ready to transport.",
        "Dinah: Hey, I'm going to come.",
        "Mallet: No, don't come, don't come. I know how you hate the site of blood.",
        "Dinah: I'm going. I'm fine.",
        "Gus: You're going to be... you're going to be okay.",
        "Mallet: Thanks for watching my back, all right. Bye.",
        "Harley: Mallet may be clueless, but I'm not.",
        "Gus: Clu...",
        "Harley: You are high. And your partner almost got killed because of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "R.J.: Is that, like, as old as the Declaration of Independence?",
        "Josh: Almost, yeah.",
        "Cassie: Well. Josh...",
        "Josh: It's my father's handwriting. I just haven't seen it in a... God, I had completely forgotten about these, you know. But he never did.",
        "R.J.: What is it?",
        "Josh: This was just my father's dream; probably the only one he never actually was never able to live out. Did you know he was a pilot in world war II? In fact, he was a very good one. I'll show you a picture of his plane sometime, okay? He had a drawing of my mom on the side of the plain. ( Laughs )",
        "Cassie: So, then these are blueprints for something?",
        "Josh: Yeah. Um, he and I used to go to a veterans hospital a long way away, and we used to visit a lot of soldiers from a lot of wars. And he always felt like we needed to do something more, that he needed to do something for them.",
        "Cassie: So it's a hospital?",
        "Josh: It is a privately funded medical center and community-- yes, a hospital, and also a rehabilitation center.",
        "Cassie: And it looks like there are places here for their families to stay?",
        "Josh: Yeah. That was so the soldiers could come and go through whatever rehab they had to go through without having to say good-bye to their loved ones.",
        "Cassie: So, why didn't he ever do this?",
        "Josh: It's not like he didn't try. He took it to the board a few times, but he ran into 100 miles of red tape, that kind of thing.",
        "Cassie: Well, I think it's a great idea.",
        "Josh: It's a labor of love.",
        "Cassie: I can see that. Not just for him.",
        "Josh: Well, like I said, we used to visit these guys, you know? I mean, wounded soldiers. It wasn't like he gave up on it. He just ran out of... he ran out of time.",
        "Cassie: Uh-oh.",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Cassie: I can see the wheels turning. You're thinking, \"Ooh, I... I have enough time.\"",
        "Josh: No, I don't have time. I'm busy, very busy.",
        "Cassie: Right.",
        "Josh: But it would be an amazing way to honor him. And our soldiers certainly need this now more than they ever had. It just... it would be practically impossible. I mean, there would be a thousand things that could go wrong. Zoning and funding.",
        "Cassie: Blah, blah, blah...",
        "Josh: I just... it would be a huge, huge project to take on.",
        "Cassie: So, do I have to show you a mirror and show you the look on your face?",
        "Josh: No, I don't think so. I think I can... I'm aware of it. It's just a big... it's actually what I'm looking for, I think. (Laughs ) I mean, to do something other than just build big office buildings-- carry on his legacy.",
        "Cassie: What do you think, R.J?",
        "R.J.: Sounds good to me.",
        "Josh: Me, too.",
        "Cassie: So, H.B. was going to build this right here on the land?",
        "Josh: Yeah, yeah. But see, that was part of the problem. There wasn't enough property to do it, so we would have to get a portion of somebody's else's property to make it work.",
        "Cassie: Well, I don't why that would be a problem. The ranch next door is huge. Who's going to miss a few acres?",
        "Josh: A guy named Buck Larkens, a greedy old coot.",
        "Cassie: Well, we'll have to make him an offer he can't refuse.",
        "Josh: We?",
        "Cassie: You didn't think I was going to let you do this all on your own?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Ashlee, hey.",
        "Ashlee: Hi, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: I'm sorry I'm late. I got held up.",
        "Ashlee: It's okay. I wasn't expecting you should show up anyway.",
        "Lizzie: Well, I said I would, didn't I?",
        "Ashlee: Yeah, but you also said that we could go to the movies sometime.",
        "Lizzie: There is not really anything out that I want to see.",
        "Ashlee: That was three years ago.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, I have been so busy.",
        "Ashlee: Yeah, I know. I see your picture in the \"Style\" section all of the time.",
        "Lizzie: You know something, there is a charity event next week. You should totally come with me.",
        "Ashlee: Really?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. Tons of hot, rich guys.",
        "Ashlee: Wow, yeah, I'd love to.",
        "Lizzie: So, about that favor.",
        "Ashlee: Yeah, I wasn't really clear on it. You didn't say much.",
        "Lizzie: It's actually pretty simple. I just... I need you to put me down on the books as having been a patient for the last month.",
        "Ashlee: I can't do that, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, I mean, even as a favor for me? Who would know?",
        "Ashlee: My uncle, the doctor, for one, and he wouldn't be too happy about it.",
        "Lizzie: It is the only way the insurance is going to cover the pregnancy.",
        "Ashlee: Pregnancy? Wow. You're...",
        "Lizzie: I am.",
        "Ashlee: Wow, who's the father?",
        "Lizzie: My boyfriend, Coop, of course.",
        "Ashlee: Oh. Okay, so, why do you need me to do it?",
        "Lizzie: Because we're friends, and that's what friends do, right? I mean, unless you don't want to help me.",
        "Ashlee: I do. I do.",
        "Lizzie: Great.",
        "Ashlee: It's just my uncle could lose his license over something like this. And I really would like to help, but I...(buzzer sounds ) I'll be back. Just one minute, okay?",
        "Lizzie: Come on, Ashlee, wait.",
        "Ashlee: One minute.",
        "Lizzie: ( Sighs ) Hey.",
        "Coop: Hi, Lizzie. I just came to help you baby- sit.",
        "Lizzie: Henry Cooper Bradshaw, you followed me. You are so cute.",
        "Coop: What?",
        "Lizzie: You, you're cute for worrying. You're going to make such a good daddy.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, I followed you because you've been avoiding me, and that really makes me wonder.",
        "Lizzie: What?",
        "Coop: You told me you were going to be babysitting your brother.",
        "Lizzie: I was. And then I... I started to not feel good, so I came here.",
        "Coop: This is your doctor's office? Lizzie, it's a free clinic, and not to mention, it's in the worst part of town.",
        "Lizzie: My family happens to fund this clinic, and Dr. Crane is the best.",
        "Coop: Oh, really. Well, I certainly would like to talk to him, find out how everything is coming along, you know.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, yeah. It's just right now is not a good time.",
        "Coop: Oh.",
        "Lizzie: He is way too busy.",
        "Coop: Uh-huh. Too busy for Lizzie Spaulding, hm?",
        "Lizzie: Look, I'm serious, Coop. I'm serious. He is so busy. He was just going to squeeze me in. I didn't even have an appointment. But I actually feel fine now. So, let's come back another time.",
        "Coop: You know what, I really think you don't want me to talk to the doctor, now, do you?",
        "Lizzie: Okay, why would you say something that silly? I'm late to go get James. We will have plenty of time for doctors, believe me. Come on, let's go.",
        "Coop: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You didn't call your mom and tell her about any of this?",
        "Lizzie: Um yeah, she doesn't know yet.",
        "Coop: So, you didn't call her at all? So she has no idea what's going on or that you're going to late?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, no, I called and told her that.",
        "Coop: Well, then that's good. We've got plenty of time then.",
        "Lizzie: But the doctor doesn't.",
        "Ashlee: Hi, can I help you?",
        "Coop: Yes, I'm sure you can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: So, as you can see, the entire project will encompass about 30 acres, not a whole lot, really.",
        "Buck: No. But I got a new barn up on that corner of my property. Just finished, as a matter of fact.",
        "Josh: You know what, I can rebuild that barn anywhere you want.",
        "Buck: I know, but city limits are close enough as it is, and now you want a medical center butting up against me?",
        "Josh: Have you ever heard the term contextual development?",
        "Buck: You're telling me the place is going to look like a ranch.",
        "Josh: Pretty much, yeah.",
        "Buck: It's a lofty plan, Josh, I'll give you that.",
        "Cassie: Are you sure I can't bring you a sandwich or something?",
        "Buck: No, this will be just fine, little lady.",
        "Josh: Cassie, why don't you sit down, okay?",
        "Cassie: Thanks.",
        "Josh: Sure.",
        "Buck: So, you say you're Reva's sister?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, that's right.",
        "Buck: Hawk told me that you and the misses are separated. Is that true?",
        "Josh: No, no, it is not true. We're still very much married.",
        "Buck: Where is she now?",
        "Cassie: She is in Paris visiting my niece, Marah. So, what do you think of the plans, Mr. Larkin?",
        "Buck: Call me Buck.",
        "Cassie: Okay, Buck. I'm sure you can see what an incredible opportunity this is.",
        "Buck: Opportunity?",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Josh: Yes, to be part of something that will last, something that will actually make people's lives better.",
        "Buck: You can't argue with that.",
        "Cassie: No, sure can't.",
        "Buck: No, it's a great plan, Josh, and I hope you're very successful with it.",
        "Josh: Well, thank you very much.",
        "Buck: Just not on my land. I'm sorry, but my land is not for sale.",

        "EMT: Looks like no visible bones are filed. Bp is 130/90.",

        "Rick: A pint. A pint will be fine. Don't worry. It's going to find. We're going to sew him up and I'll be right out to tell you how it went, okay?",

        "Gus: It's not what you think.",
        "Harley: Look at you. Your pupils are the size of a nickels.",
        "Gus: I had a lot of coffee.",
        "Harley: Don't lie to me. You're taking those painkillers.",

        "Harley: Why did you go to Cedars today? Cedars?",
        "Gus: My job.",
        "Harley: Right, right, right. The deposition, right? Because I talked to that Nurse Garrity. She said she never heard of you. It's no deposition. You went there to get pills. Tell the truth. Tell the truth.",
        "Gus: I'm going to the hospital.",
        "Harley: No, no, no. Focus on me. Deal with this. Okay, your partner got shot. You were supposed to be there for him. You come loaded with a gun in your hand? You risked both of your lives.",
        "Gus: That's not what happened.",
        "Harley: Don't lie to me. We talked about this. You admitted you had a problem.",
        "Gus: I had a problem.",
