        "Tony: I don't know what to tell you.",

        "Tony: Really?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I don't think they're going to prosecute. He said something about a deal being in place and, maybe, Danny should take it.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Why are you here?",

        "Danny: I had things to do, Like feeding my child.",

        "Rick: It's just this election stuff, dad. It's just nonsense.",
        "Ed: Is Michelle here? Her car's in the driveway.",

        "Ed: Maybe I'll go check on her.",
        "Michelle: Oh, don't bother. I'm right here. Just like always, when things go wrong. What are you guys doing?",
        "Rick: Well, I'm, you know, busting my tail making breakfast and dad's relaxing over there, reading the newspaper.",

        "Ed: You don't have to if you don't want to.",
        "Michelle: (Sighs) I really hate it when you're so congenial. Does anyone want some coffee? Rick I hate to break this to you, Michelle, but congenial runs in the family. I mean, you're just as sweet...",
        "Michelle: This doesn't seem weird to you?",

        "Ed: I'm sure there was a reason for you coming over here, and if you want to tell us what it is, that's good. If you don't, that's fine, too.",
        "Michelle: There's nothing to tell. Things went wrong with Danny and I took off. So, what else is new?",
        "Rick: Hey, Michelle.",
        "Michelle: I just don't know which is worse, you know? Running away or running here.",

        "Michelle: You know, I appreciate what you're trying to do, and I love you guys, I do.",
        "Rick: Okay, then what is the problem, Michelle?",
        "Michelle: The problem is I'm a failure, okay? When am I going to learn to stand on my own two feet?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: I don't want Robbie hearing any of this.",
        "Jeffrey: I totally understand. I'm sorry. So, how'd you handle Michelle? I mean, I saw the press conference. She said she was going to stay by your side until the very end.",

        "Jeffrey: Well, Danny, did you?",
        "Danny: Look, O'Neil, how I handle things with Michelle-- my wife-- is none of your damn business. All you need to know is that she's gone. Got it?",

        "Jeffrey: I'm just trying to be understanding here, okay? I really don't care if you believe it or not, quite frankly, okay? We don't have to be friends. We're not friends.",
        "Danny: You got that right, we're not friends. You think I don't know that you don't give a damn about Michelle or my family? Hey, what's the matter? Why did you throw your cereal around? What's up? Huh? Are you bored? You're bored. All right.",
        "Danny: Why are you still here?",

        "Cassie: Well, he's got to keep his head up. People are going to believe in him again.",
        "Tony: Let me ask you something, Cassie. Do you believe in him? Do you?",
        "Cassie: Of course I do.",
        "Tony: Because he's your friend?",
        "Cassie: Because I know him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tony: Okay, because a small part of me thinks that you might... that you might think he's guilty. Am I right?",
        "Cassie: Danny's changed, Tony.",
        "Tony: Is that what you told O'Neill?",
        "Cassie: Yes, that's what I told O'Neill.",
        "Tony: Because you don't know what it's like.",
        "Cassie: What it's like?",
        "Tony: To be a Santos. You have no idea.",
        "Cassie: I think I have an idea.",
        "Tony: No, I don't think you do.",
        "Cassie: I used to be a stripper, okay? Do you know how people used to look at me?",
        "Tony: It's not the same, Cassie. It's not the same. People are scared of us. That's something you don't get over very easily, all right?",
        "Cassie: I used to believe that, but I don't anymore.",
        "Tony: Why compare this to you?",
        "Cassie: Why not?",
        "Tony: Because first of all, people think that Danny is a liar and a criminal. It may be the case. No offense, it's a whole different story from stripper turned princess, all right? I'm sorry. You've never walked in our shoes, Cassie, not once.",
        "Cassie: Okay. But the people who matter the most aren't going to give up on him, Tony. Michelle, you and I are going to help Danny get through this.",
        "Tony: Maybe.",
        "Cassie: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Tony: It means I don't know what Danny wants anymore. I don't know.",
        "Lizzie: Um, Cassie?",
        "Tony: I'm going to grab some breakfast.",
        "Cassie: Tony, wait a second.",
        "Lizzie: I didn't mean to interrupt.",
        "Cassie: That's all right, Lizzie. What is it?",
        "Lizzie: I just need to find Tammy. We were supposed to meet. I've got a project after school and...",
        "Cassie: Well, maybe she's still sleeping.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. Then I guess I'll come back.",
        "Cassie: No. No, don't. I'm going to take care of a few things and I'll go up with you. Okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Hi, Tammy. We have to talk.",
        "Tammy: What would you like to talk about?",
        "Edmund: Last night.",
        "Tammy: It was great, wasn't it?",
        "Edmund: Yes, Tammy. The play was a huge success. You should be very proud.",
        "Tammy: You want to know something? I am proud.",
        "Edmund: Good. Tammy, I-I-I-I'm glad. I'm glad you feel this way. You're happy, you're excited.",
        "Tammy: Really?",
        "Edmund: Yes. Sometimes when we're excited, we do things at the spur of the moment and sometimes we do things that at the time feel right.",
        "Tammy: I don't understand. Everything was perfect.",
        "Edmund: No, Tammy. Not everything.",
        "Tammy: Could we talk about this later? I think, you know, Lizzie's coming over and she might be downstairs.",
        "Edmund: This is something I'd rather not put off, all right?",
        "Tammy: Actually, it's really pretty important. We're working on a project for ancient history.",
        "Edmund: Tammy, it's about the kiss.",
        "Tammy: Yes?",
        "Edmund: I've been thinking about it.",
        "Tammy: Me, too.",
        "Edmund: And I'm trying to understand. It was an impulse, brought on by adrenaline, perhaps.",
        "Tammy: Maybe.",
        "Edmund: And sometimes when we come down from that adrenaline, from that incredible high... Tammy, what I'm trying to say is I think... you may come to regret it when you realize that the kiss was a mistake.",
        "Tammy: A mistake?",
        "Edmund: Yes, Tammy, it was a mistake.",
        "Tammy: Don't!",
        "Edmund: Tammy, the last thing I want to do is embarrass you.",
        "Tammy: I'm not embarrassed. It was just a kiss, Edmund. It didn't mean anything.",
        "Edmund: Tammy, Tammy, I just don't want you to misunderstand.",
        "Tammy: What would I misunderstand? I just... I don't want to talk about it!",
        "Edmund: All right, fine. You're upset.",
        "Tammy: I don't want to talk about it!",
        "Edmund: Tammy, please, just wait.",
        "Cassie: Hey, Tammy. Tammy, what...",
        "Lizzie: Maybe I should go check on her.",
        "Edmund: No, wait. Let her go.",
        "Cassie: Edmund!",
        "Edmund: Just let her go, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: What is going on here? What?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, something happened last night.",
        "Cassie: What happened?",
        "Edmund: Tammy kissed me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Ah, Lupo, what's up, man? I wasn't expecting a wake-up call the morning after the play. I thought we'd all be recuperating.",
        "Joey: I'm sorry, man. I didn't know who else to talk to.",
        "Sandy: Wow. Okay, this is big. Talk to me, Joe.",
        "Joey: It's about Tammy. I'm losing her, and I don't know why. Sandy, I think she's seeing someone else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: No matter how hard I try, I keep going back to the same place over and over and over again.",
        "Rick: Michelle, we don't know what happened here, but you can't take the blame entirely on yourself.",
        "Ed: He's right, hon.",
        "Michelle: You know what? If he... if this was true, then I would be home right now. I would be in my own home. I would be doing something. I would be doing anything but this.",
        "Ed: Sweetie, wait a minute. Just tell us what it is you think you're doing here.",
        "Michelle: I'm running away. I'm escaping the truth.",
        "Ed: Coming to your family is not running away. I mean, that's utilizing... utilizing your resources.",
        "Rick: Right. I mean, just think of dad as an old library.",
        "Ed: Oh, that's good. A librarian who's always cracking corny jokes.",
        "Rick: Michelle, just tell... tell us what it is that you need from us. We'll help you.",
        "Michelle: I don't know. I don't know. All I know is I've got a little boy at home who relies on me, and I can't just up and run away every time Danny and I have trouble.",
        "Rick: You're not doing that. It's just one night. You've been here less than 12 hours.",
        "Michelle: Don't you get it? You can't be my crutch.",
        "Ed: We can be whatever you need us to be, honey.",
        "Michelle: Truth-tellers?",
        "Rick: Yeah, sure, always. What is it?",
        "Michelle: All right, then go ahead. Tell me I should never have gone back to Danny because it was only a matter of time before he broke my heart, right?",
        "Rick: I can't say that I'm surprised by this.",
        "Ed: Michelle, what you just said, is that what you really feel?",
        "Michelle: I don't know, dad. Nothing makes sense to me.",
        "Ed: Then trust your instincts. You can get it right.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, what's right?",
        "Ed: Maureen raised you to know right from wrong.",
        "Michelle: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And I love mom for instilling that in me, but sometimes it would be just so much easier not to care.",
        "Ed: Look, I know that you're looking for answers, but I can't give you any.",
        "Michelle: Oh, dad.",
        "Ed: You've got to figure this out on your own, hon.",
        "Michelle: Okay, Rick, what about you? You've always had your reservations about Danny, so what do you think?",
        "Rick: Michelle, it's your life. It doesn't matter what I think.",
        "Michelle: So much for my crutch.",
        "Rick: Well, you're the one who wants to stand on her own two feet, right?",
        "Michelle: Yeah. I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: How's that? Is that better? Okay, here you go. Why don't you... here, play with your dinosaur. Here's your truck, all right? Daddy's going to talk to Mr. O'Neill for a couple of minutes. I'll be back to hang out with you, okay?",
        "(Danny Sighs)",
        "Jeffrey: You're good with him.",
        "Danny: Let's talk business.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, that's why I'm here. I leave for Salerno, New York City the day after tomorrow.",
        "Danny: You bought my ticket?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that's one of the perks of working for the government.",
        "Danny: The only one.",
        "Jeffrey: Have you thought about what you're going to say?",
        "Danny: What's there to think about?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, did you think you were just going to go in there cold?",
        "Danny: I'm a natural, O'Neill, remember?",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, all right. We'll discuss it.",
        "Danny: Well, I'm not worried.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, we'll discuss it anyway, okay? We'll script out something. I don't want you to go in there appearing too eager.",
        "Danny: I have done this once or twice before.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, Danny, I said this before and I'm going to say it again: You work for me. Don't forget that. Don't do anything without my approval.",
        "Danny: Who's the expert here?",
        "Jeffrey: Just so long as we understand each other.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Hey, Tony.",
        "Tony: What are you doing here, O'Neill? Huh?",
        "Jeffrey: I'm just making a house call, Tony.",
        "Danny: Are we finished?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, for now.",
        "Tony: What's going on? The news is following an investigator that tells of a truck going down the roadway hitting 11 people, who are in critical condition. This is called road rage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Tammy kissed you?",
        "Edmund: On the lips.",
        "Cassie: A real kiss?",
        "Edmund: I don't know. I'm not sure.",
        "Cassie: When?",
        "Edmund: On the balcony, when I went to go look for her.",
        "Cassie: Why didn't you tell me this last night? Okay, Edmund! I don't understand this. I want to know exactly what happened.",
        "Edmund: I went out onto the balcony. She was there. She was gazing at the stars. She was trying to hold on to the magic of the evening. I complimented her, and She kissed me.",
        "Cassie: Okay, well, you know, she was probably so caught up in the magic of the night.",
        "Edmund: That's what I hoped.",
        "Cassie: She probably would have kissed anyone that walked out there at that moment.",
        "Edmund: Perhaps.",
        "Cassie: But you're not buying this.",
        "Edmund: She asked me not to tell you about it.",
        "Cassie: So?",
        "Edmund: Well, if it's so innocent, why hide it? Cassie, I don't mean to imply anything sordid in this...",
        "Cassie: But?",
        "Edmund: ... But the kiss was surprising, yes. But, it is the reaction to the kiss that has me worried.",
        "Cassie: Why? How'd she react?",
        "Edmund: I thought she'd be mortified, but she... she wasn't. She didn't even realize she'd gone too far.",
        "Cassie: Okay. You should have told me about this last night.",
        "Edmund: Maybe. But I didn't... it was her big night, Cassie. I didn't want to humiliate her in the middle of her big night. I thought we could talk about it in the morning and come to some sort of resolution.",
        "Cassie: What did she say?",
        "Edmund: She said it meant nothing and that she didn't want to talk about it.",
        "Cassie: Oh, god. She must have been so embarrassed.",
        "Edmund: Yes, but it was more than embarrassment, Cassie. I mean, you saw what just happened. Cassie, what if Tammy has feelings for me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Edmund, if only you knew how much it meant to me to kiss you, you would never call it a mistake. \"Mistake\" , I hate this word. Why does something so good have to hurt so much? Oh, why am I doing this to myself? Nothing can happen. Nothing will ever happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Whoa, Joe, relax. You're getting delusional on me here.",
        "Joey: I just know she's seeing someone else. I mean, why wouldn't another guy want her? She's smart. She's caring. She's beautiful and she's so hot.",
        "Sandy: True. Don't look at me like that. I'm her cousin, man.",
        "Joey: Okay, \"cousin,\" what do I do?",
        "Sandy: I say if you want her, fight for her. But be smart about it. Get some outside help.",
        "Joey: Outside help?",
        "Sandy: Yeah, someone who knows Tammy even better than you do. Gather some ideas, formulate a plan and make it happen. Surprise her. Women love surprises.",
        "Joey: A surprise plan? I can do surprises. I did a surprise for her with the song.",
        "Sandy: Yeah. That was a good one, actually. So keep it up. But do me a favor, though? Run it by me before you just spring it on her.",
        "Joey: Absolutely. Thanks a lot, man. You're a lifesaver. I owe you.",
        "Sandy: Ah, no problem. Hey, let's start with breakfast, then, huh? You need to build up your strength to win your woman. Come on, let's go. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Why do you think O'Neill was here? He cut me a deal. We were going over the details.",
        "Tony: He cut you a deal? What's with you, Danny?",
        "Danny: I'm not getting into this with you, Tony.",
        "Tony: Well, I want you to. Take a look around here, Danny. You've got a great house, a great kid and a wonderful wife. (Logically)I'm asking you, do you want to lose it all?",
        "Danny: Too late.",
        "Tony: It's too late? Just like that?",
        "Danny: That's what I said, too late. Michelle stayed at her dad's last night.",
        "Tony: Michelle left you?",
        "Danny: That's what it looks like, Tony.",

        "Danny: It just happened.",
        "Tony: It just happened? What the hell is going on here? That's crap, Danny.",
        "Danny: Tony, Michelle knows the truth: I couldn't do it, I couldn't stay clean. Look around you. Look at this house. Michelle and Robbie deserve the best of everything. I did what I had to do to give it to them.",
        "Tony: So you gave in and you get greedy.",
        "Danny: If that's what you want to call it, Tony.",
        "Tony: That is what I'm going to call it. What you're doing makes no sense to me. Nothing makes sense here, Danny.",
        "Danny: Don't tell me that you wouldn't have done the exact same thing if you walked in my shoes",
        "Tony: You want the truth? The truth is if I had what you had, I wouldn't have.",
        "Danny: End of discussion!",
        "Tony: You know something? You're making a mistake, Danny! You're turning your back on everything that you got in this life! What is wrong with you?!",
        "Danny: You know what? I bought into that same bag of bull. That was my big mistake.",

        "Cassie: Tammy, she doesn't have feelings for you. I mean, she sees you as her family.",
        "Edmund: I'm talking about a schoolgirl crush, Cassie-- nothing more-- but it doesn't make her feelings any less real.",
        "Cassie: I would have noticed, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: I didn't. All through the play, I didn't notice. And the signs were all there, in hindsight.",
        "Cassie: What signs?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, all the time we were working on the play, working so closely together, she was ... she was always very grateful to me and always very interested in my opinion.",
        "Cassie: Because she looks up to you. Because she thinks that you're one of her friends. You've been there for her since Richard died.",
        "Edmund: And that could account for a lot of it. Every single man in her life has left her, including her father.",
        "Cassie: Oh, come on. I think you're looking way too into this.",
        "Edmund: Maybe. Maybe I am, but considering what just happened?",
        "Cassie: I know my daughter, okay? But, I also know teenage girls. This is just one big misunderstanding.",
        "Edmund: I hope you're right.",
        "Cassie: Trust me. I will I'll talk to her.",
        "Edmund: Good. Good. Just don't wait too long.",
        "Cassie: I won't. But, you know what? Everything is going to be fine. You'll see.",
        "Edmund: Good.",
        "Cassie: Well, thank you for telling me.",
        "Edmund: Well, you're welcome. And I'm... I'm sorry I didn't tell you last night.",
        "Cassie: You should have. But I understand.",
        "Edmund: Yeah. You know, perhaps I should give a bit of distance until you two talk.",
        "Cassie: I don't think that's necessary.",
        "Edmund: Well, I still... I still think it would be for the best.",
        "Cassie: Okay. All right. Well, I guess I'll see you later.",
        "Edmund: Okay. I'll call you first, all right?",

        "Tammy: (Sniffles) Nothing.",
        "Lizzie: You're crying.",
        "Tammy: You caught me.",
        "Lizzie: Look, I told your mom that I'd come out here and check on you. Did something happen?",
        "Tammy: Just me being an idiot.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. Well, do you want to tell me about it?",
        "Tammy: I just... I feel so stupid. I'm just thinking about the play last night. It's over. After all that, it's just over.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I know what you mean. It's like Christmas. All these months go by and build up for this one day and then, poof, it's the day after. It feels really empty. I always hated it.",
        "Tammy: Though I can't quite imagine hating the day after Christmas in your house.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, you're messing up my story now.",
        "Tammy: Can I ask you something?",
        "Lizzie: What?",
        "Tammy: Did you ever see something and then feel really stupid for not seeing it? I mean, it was slapping you in the face?",
        "Lizzie: Well, I don't exactly miss much.",
        "Tammy: Never? And then you hated yourself for not seeing it?",
        "Lizzie: You're not talking about the play anymore, are you?",
        "Tammy: Does it matter?",
        "Lizzie: No, but I wish I knew what to say to you.",
        "Tammy: You don't have to say anything.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, I did feel stupid one time. I really liked Shayne, and I didn't know that he liked Marina. I guess that was something that should have been obvious, but...",
        "Tammy: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Lizzie: It was a dumb dream, anyway.",
        "Tammy: You know what? I think I'm going to go for a run around the lake.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. Well, I'll go with you.",
        "Tammy: You know what? I think I want to go by myself and clear my head. And then I have to call Joey at some point.",

        "Danny: Get off your high horse! Go back to your ranch!",
        "Tony: You got out, you know that? You got a chance to do something productive for this family.",
        "Danny: You got out, too. You have your own life now.",
        "Tony: Yeah, maybe I do, but you know what? You're the one who should have made it, Danny.",
        "Danny: I tried, Tony. I told you, I couldn't do it.",
        "Tony: Well, you didn't try hard enough. You didn't try hard enough!",
        "Danny: I tried everything that I could do. I shook hands. I hosted parties at the country clubs. It didn't work.",
        "Tony: (Laughs) So, now what, huh?",
        "Danny: You know what, I am who I am. I'm getting smart about it and I'm not running away from it anymore. It's my destiny.",
        "Tony: Really? You want to know what's your destiny? This is your destiny. Your son is your destiny.",

        "Danny: His dad is a mobster. He always has been, always will be.",
        "Tony: What in the hell ... what is wrong with you, man?",
        "Danny: When you came back to town, you made it very clear-- very clear-- that you wanted your own life, separate from me, so let's just keep it that way. Okay?",
        "Tony: What about Michelle?",
        "Danny: She got the message. She walked out.",

        "Ed: No. I know I can't do anything about it, Rick. But, it's driving me crazy.",
        "Rick: Well, I can think of a couple things.",
        "Ed: We can't do anything. We can't push it, not this time.",
        "Rick: You know what? I was going to stay out of it, too, but we don't have to do that, dad, do we?",
        "Ed: We don't even know what's going on.",
        "Rick: We saw that press conference. I think we have a pretty clear idea what is going on.",
        "Ed: Michelle is a grownup. She deserves the right to make her own choices and her own mistakes.",

        "Ed: I'm not saying that.",
        "Rick: All right, then I'll say it.",
        "Ed: Don't.",
        "Rick: Dad, please, I have watched this marriage from the very beginning. It has been one unmitigated disaster after another. Your daughter almost lost her life twice. They have broken up and gotten together more times than I can count.",
        "Ed: I know, Rick. I worry about all of that stuff, too.",
        "Rick: Well, it happens all the time. And this election disaster is just the tip of the iceberg. I'm sure there's more to follow after this.",
        "Ed: No. I think you're just doing the worst-case scenario.",
        "Rick: I have come to expect this with Danny Santos. Now, come on. You saw him. Does he seem like a man who's ready to dive into public service, dad?",
        "Ed: No.",
        "Rick: .Or prove his critics wrong?",
        "Ed: No, he looked like a man to me who was just so completely disillusioned. Why would...",
        "Rick: I don't give a damn about Danny! I care about Michelle. That's all I care about.",
        "Ed: Danny is Michelle's husband and he's Robbie's father. We don't have the right to not give a damn about Danny.",
        "Rick: Well, fine. You can just speak for yourself on that one.",
        "Ed: Rick, my guess is Danny is now just hanging by a thread.",
        "Rick: Michelle should just cut him loose.",
        "Ed: But if she does... if she does, I mean, maybe Michelle is the only one who's keeping him from falling.",
        "Rick: Well, you know what? You can never convince me of that one from experience, but if you believe that, go upstairs and sell it to her, dad.",
        "Ed: I can't. She's got to make up her own mind about this. Now, listen, Michelle can stay here as long as she wants. But, Rick, she doesn't belong here.",

        "Cassie: (Sighs) Richard. I need you. This one's a doozy. Tammy kissed Edmund and then, she took off out of here. (Crackling Voice) Oh, god, I'm so worried about her. You know, you were the first man to ever make her feel protected. If you were alive, I wouldn't be going through this right now. I mean, Edmund's trying hard, but... why am I freaking out about this? Come on, Cassie. If Richard were here, he would tell you you're being completely silly. I have to find Tammy and talk to her about this to find out what's going on. I hope she's going to tell me. Tammy can be completely honest with me, right? God, I wish I knew what was going on in her head.",

        "Lizzie: \"Edmund kissed me, just like I always thought he would. Well, okay, technically I kissed him. It was such a perfect moment. I wonder if he's still out on that terrace thinking of me just like I'm thinking of him.\" Oh, Tammy, you have lost it. Well, it's time for a rude awakening.",

        "Cassie: \"Tammy drop this\"?",

        "Rick: It wasn't enough, was it? Now she's running around, god knows where.",
        "Ed: I feel bad about that, too, Rick.",
        "Rick: You should have gone up there. She needs a father.",
        "Ed: She needs to figure this out on her own. Don't lay all of this on me. You were right along with me having the hands-off approach.",
        "Rick: Well, I've changed my mind.",
        "Ed: It wouldn't have made any difference.",
        "Rick: You could do that to me, the hands-off approach. But I don't need you like your daughter does.",
        "Ed: Neither of you need me, Rick. You got on just fine without me for a long time.",
        "Rick: That's right. Because we had no other choice, did we? But that doesn't mean...",
        "Ed: Go ahead.",

        "Ed: Son, you don't know that.",
