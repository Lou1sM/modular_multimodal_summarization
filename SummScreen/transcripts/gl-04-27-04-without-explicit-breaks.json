        "Josh: Reva? Darling, look, I'm all up for surprises and all of that, but I think it's going to start raining. Thank you very much. I appreciate that.",
        "Reva: What's more important, sweetheart, rain or romance?",
        "Josh: Well, actually, we had romance in Paris.",
        "Reva: Oh, I know. Just wait.",
        "Josh: You know, this is not really a good way to treat your husband who is jet-lagged and starving! Hello?",
        "Reva: Entrez-vous, s'il vous plait, monsieur.",
        "Josh: Very nice.",
        "Reva: Merci beaucoup.",
        "Josh: Lovely. Wow! (Laughs) Look at this. This is great. This is incredible. You look fabulous.",
        "Reva: But?",
        "Josh: I was just thinking we could forget about Paris tonight because I was feeling a little homesick for the United States.",
        "Reva: You know, I had a feeling you just might say something like that. Here. Sit.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Reva: (Laughs) Voila!",
        "Josh: (Laughs)",
        "Reva: The only thing about that meal is the fries.",
        "Josh: This is what I call romantic. Thank you.",

        "Joey: Yeah, she's on her way down so we could study. I'm glad I caught you. There's something we need to talk about.",
        "Edmund: It sounds serious.",

        "Danny: Hi. I'm guessing you're here to take Robbie with you back to your dad's place. He's already asleep.",
        "Michelle: I didn't come here for Robbie.",
        "Danny: What are you going to do, pick up some of your things? I don't understand. I thought that when you left last night...",
        "Michelle: You thought that I wasn't coming back, right? I did. This is my home, Danny and I'm not leaving.",
        "Danny: No. No, Michelle, I can't let you do this.",
        "Michelle: Okay, are you telling me that I can't come into my own home? Are you, also, telling me that you don't want me here?",

        "Danny: It's not?",
        "Michelle: I told you I'm staying, okay? Are we safe to talk here now?",
        "Danny: Yes. I had the house swept earlier. What do you want to say?",
        "Michelle: I need you to just admit to me that you're just worried about our safety.",
        "Danny: Yes, I am. Is there something wrong with that?",
        "Michelle: You're worried about mine and Robbie's safety.",

        "Michelle: .if Saleroom and other mob guys find out you're working with O'Neill...",
        "Danny: Yes, that's why you need to take Robbie somewhere where you'll be safe.",
        "Michelle: We're not going to be safe, Danny, until you bring down this mob for good. I'm not going to live someone else's life while you're doing it.",
        "Danny: Someone else's life? What do you mean, somebody else's life?",
        "Michelle: You know,... I couldn't sleep last night at my dad's house, because my room isn't my room. My room is our room. It's in this house, which is our house. This is our life, and I'm not going to give it up.",
        "Danny: Do Me...",
        "Michelle: I'm not going to give up on you either.",
        "Danny: I mean, come on. Do I really have to list all the reasons why you have to?",
        "Michelle: No, I've thought of all them. I have. The only real reason why I'm not cutting you off is because I love you, Danny.",
        "Danny: I love you, too. That's why you can't stay.",
        "Michelle: No, please. Please don't tell me what I can and can't do, okay? I'm not going to give up on my family, our marriage, and on this life that we built together. We have fought too hard for anyone to take this life away from me-- especially you. \u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671",

        "Reva: What? Order take-out from company?",
        "Josh: No, no, no. I mean all of this. Is this your idea of normal?",
        "Reva: Maybe. What do you think?",
        "Josh: I think someone is trying too hard to make things appear to be normal-- whatever that word means. I think she might be doing it because she misses our daughter.",
        "Reva: You're not fighting fair.",
        "Josh: I do miss her, too, Reva. She seems pretty excited about living in Paris with Mindy.",
        "Reva: I know. I'm excited for her. I just... don't like that she's staying there and the fact that we had to ambush her to get her to go. I realize it'll be good for her after the last few months that she's has and it'll be good for us, too. We deserve it, too.",
        "Josh: Oh, hey, I'm on board for that, you know. I mean, after I saw you in the hospital after... I'm sorry. I just don't ever want to come that close to losing you again. This psychic gift of yours, I don't know if it's a blessing or a curse, or...",
        "Reva: Yeah. Well, about my gift...",
        "Josh: No, I know what you're going to say.",
        "Reva: Really? Are you psychic now?",
        "Josh: I am. I predict that you're going to make some comment about the fact that I have not been completely on board with your research. I have to say that watching the way that you were able to connect with Maryanne Caruthers and prove that Carrie was the one who killed her, that was incredible. It saved Marah and it saved me.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, and now I'm done.",
        "Josh: What does that mean?",
        "Reva: I'm not knocking the gift that I have. I mean, it's helped a lot of very important people. But I'm done with all that now. I am hanging up my psychic powers.",
        "Josh: I didn't think it worked like that.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, me neither. I don't have much choice in the matter.",
        "Josh: So what exactly do you mean?",
        "Reva: I mean that my gift is already gone. \u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671",
        "Cassie: What book?",
        "Tammy: I thought I left it in here. Ancient history. We have an exam tomorrow.",
        "Cassie: Have you been crying?",
        "Tammy: No.",
        "Cassie: Tammy?",
        "Tammy: Oh, okay... well, okay. Well, maybe a little bit at my study group at school. Maybe I cried just a little bit.",
        "Cassie: So what happened?",
        "Tammy: Oh, they were good tears. You know, everyone was just gushing about how well I did in the play and how great the reviews were. And somebody even told me all the teachers really liked it-- even the football coach, and he's a total jock, so...",
        "Cassie: And that's what made you cry?",
        "Tammy: Yeah. Well, it was just all so overwhelming. I just went to the ladies room and had a little moment. Well, you know me, I just get all mushy.",
        "Cassie: Right. Well, I'm glad your friends are treating you like the star you are. Everyone did a great job last night. You kids really put on a fantastic show. You did.",
        "Tammy: Well, you know, we're not exactly little kids anymore. I mean, with all that rehearsal, we pretty much knew what we were doing. I couldn't have done it without you.",
        "Cassie: Me? What do I know about Shakespeare?",
        "Tammy: Well, every time I started doubting myself, you knew just what to say. It was really cool to have you in the audience cheering for me. It's kind of like I did the play just for you.",
        "Cassie: And Edmund. I mean, you said it yourself. You couldn't have done it without him. He made you into the Juliet that you are-- all that hard work, all those lessons.",
        "Tammy: Lessons. Exactly. I needed the books.",
        "Cassie: Oh. Okay.",
        "Tammy: Joey called. He said he's going to come over and work on this stuff with me.",
        "Cassie: Tammy?",
        "Tammy: Yeah?",
        "Cassie: Have fun.",
        "Tammy: Oh yeah, homework. What a blast.",
        "Cassie: Okay, well, she's hanging out with her friends. She's doing schoolwork with her boyfriend. That kiss with Edmund, it was just... it was nothing unless she's a better actress than I thought. \u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671",
        "Joey: So it was some night last night, huh?",
        "Edmund: How do you mean, Joey?",
        "Joey: The play.",
        "Edmund: Oh. (Laughs) of course. It was a great show. Congratulations.",
        "Joey: Congratulations to you, too. I mean, we couldn't have done it without you.",
        "Edmund: No, no, I didn't do much.",
        "Joey: Please, you did. She can't stop talking about the way you drilled Shakespeare stuff into our heads, the way you helped me with the sword fight action, and the way you coached Tammy.",
        "Edmund: Joey, you said you wanted to talk about something.",
        "Joey: Yeah. It's more about the play. The advice you gave me about playing Romeo.",
        "Edmund: All right.",
        "Joey: Well, I realized that in order to nab Juliet, I had to stop playing a part and actually pretend it was for real.",
        "Edmund: Right.",
        "Joey: Right. So now that the play's over, I have to do this in real life.",
        "Edmund: Do what?",
        "Joey: I've got to make things work with Tammy. You know, I have no script now, so I'm trying to play the whole song thing.",
        "Edmund: Well, the song was very good.",
        "Joey: Right, right. But it doesn't count, because she wasn't there to see it.",
        "Edmund: Right.",
        "Joey: So, I was thinking maybe you had some pointers you could give to me. Give me some things that I could to make Tammy happy.",
        "Edmund: What makes you think I'd be able to help you in that department?",
        "Joey: Well, you and Tammy connect. You know what mean? You really get what she wants. Hey, Tam. We were just talking about you.",
        "Tammy: Whatever he said, it's a lie.",
        "Tammy: So what did you say about me, Edmund?",
        "Edmund: Only good things, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: Oh.",
        "Joey: My girlfriend, the drama queen. (Laughs) So, what was that? Rehearsing a line from your new play? \"Whatever he said-itch, it was a lie.\"",
        "Tammy: I'm convincing, right?",
        "Joey: Convincing. I was just telling your uncle that. I was thanking him for how convincing he made us. Last night wouldn't have been the same if it wasn't for him.",
        "Tammy: That's for sure.",
        "Edmund: Tammy, it was a shame you missed Joey's song last night.",
        "Tammy: What song?",
        "Joey: Nothing. It's just that I had something prepared for you at the cast party last night.",
        "Edmund: Oh, please, you're being modest. He is quite a singer. Excuse me.",
        "Tammy: You sang for me after I left?",
        "Joey: It's cool. I'll sing for you some other time.",
        "Tammy: I'm so sorry I missed it.",
        "Joey: Like I said, some other time.",
        "Tammy: So, are you ready to get started on some of this work?",
        "Joey: No, not really. I'm still really pumped about the play last night, you know. I mean, who wants to study about a bunch of dead Romans anyway, right?",
        "Tammy: We do, if we want to pass ancient history. Don't worry about it. If you don't have your notes, you could just use my book.",
        "Joey: Okay. Whoa! Wait a minute. Maybe you could...",
        "Tammy: No, Joey.",
        "Joey: What?",
        "Tammy: I'm sure Edmund has better things to be doing right now.",
        "Joey: But it's ancient history.",
        "Edmund: Well, Joey, I'm not that old.",
        "Joey: But you were like a prince, right?",
        "Edmund: Yes, but I don't think my experience...",
        "Joey: Who better than you to tell us what went down in this royal palace, right? Come on. This is going to be good.",
        "Tammy: At first I didn't get it, but now I can totally see why mom is crazy about Edmund. He's kind of hot in like a grown-up way sort of way. He's fun, but not immature like the guys at school. But, what's really cool is that I'm starting to think he sees me as more than just a kid. When I went to him, because I was stressed out about going to a ball with Joey, he totally jumped at the chance to give me a dance lesson. We were having so much fun until mom caught us. \u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671",

        "Tammy: I haven't danced with a lot of guys. I know that this just felt different. I know he felt it, too. Uncle Edmund has been doing so much for me lately and getting so involved in our life. It's obviously a signal. There's a difference between being a girl and being a woman, and I know I've crossed that line. The problem is getting Edmund to see it. Mom has the best clothes, and when he sees me wearing her dress, it will be just the wake-up call he needs. Once he realizes that I'm the kind of women he can love, well, it will change everything. \u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671",
        "Cassie: Oh, God, Tammy. What have you done?",
        "Josh: So, are you're telling me that your psychic ability has just disappeared?",
        "Reva: I didn't even see it coming. (Laughs) How's that for powerful?",
        "Josh: Reva, don't joke about this, okay? This is a big deal.",
        "Reva: I know. I'm not joking about it. I don't even know how it happened, or if it's forever. But after I connected with Maryanne, something changed. When I was under hypnosis, I just didn't see what happened to her, I felt it. I was there. I felt her pain and her panic.",
        "Josh: Sort of like a near- death experience.",
        "Reva: Well, I don't know about that. But after the experience, it was like a window in my mind was closed.",
        "Josh: So, when you felt Maryanne's death-- or however that works-- something inside of you died, too? Is that what you're saying?",
        "Reva: Well, no, it wasn't like the feeling of death or loss. It was... it was more like liberation. You know, I worked so hard to try to learn how to own this gift. But, most of the time, it really owns me. I'm like wearing my own set of private headphones, and suddenly the music was mute, and I was free.",
        "Josh: Well, you did seem a little bit different in Paris.",
        "Reva: Different how?",
        "Josh: Don't hurt me, okay?",
        "Reva: (Laughs)",
        "Josh: You just seemed a little less distracted than usual. I assumed, of course, that it was because of my charming personality.",
        "Reva: Well, your charming personality was definitely a perk.",
        "Josh: I don't want to be the one to rain on your parade.",
        "Reva: Well, please don't.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Reva: Okay, go ahead. Be logical with me.",
        "Josh: I'm just thinking that if and when you talk to a specialist about this, don't be surprised to learn that it's just temporary.",
        "Reva: Well, I'm not going to talk to a specialist about it. I'm going to accept it and embrace it.",
        "Josh: So, we're not going to reexamine this for months and months on end? Damn!",

Look, these were good men who made a big mistake, and I was really quick to look down on them. Who am I to judge my father? And who am I to judge you? I love you. For years I've been telling you what I need you to be, and the truth is, I just need you as you are.",

I was so happy when Tammy was starting to warm up to him as a father figure in her life. She needed it so desperately after Richard died. But, then something happened that made me wonder if Tammy was maybe confused about the feelings that she felt for Edmund. Maybe there was something else?",

        "Reva: They're a little more than just a crush.",
        "Cassie: There are pages and pages of Tammy assuming every bit of kindness that Edmund showed her meant that he was falling for her. I mean, and the times that she's talking about in this book, I was there for half of them, and they were innocent. They were not the way she remembers them. So I'm sitting here thinking, okay, I have to believe this is Tammy's imagination just running wild, but I can't. I can't. I mean, if she is misinterpreting things in this big of a way, this is serious. And I have no idea... I don't know what to do. What?",
