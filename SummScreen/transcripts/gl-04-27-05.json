        "Michelle: Tony, look, I love you, I do, but I love Danny, too.",
        "Tony: No. No. You can't. You can't love Danny, Michelle. No.",
        "Michelle: You're hurting me. You're hurting me. Please.",
        "Tony: You can't love Danny. Okay?",
        "Danny: Tony. Let her go.",
        "Tony: Well, what do you know? (Laughs) Danny to the rescue as always, right?",
        "Danny: What... what are you guys doing here? I thought you were getting married.",
        "Tony: Getting married, yeah.",
        "Danny: What's going on?",
        "Tony: Getting married. No, we kind of ran into a little bit of a stumbling block, don't you think?",
        "Michelle: Danny, I think you should go home.",
        "Tony: Huh? What about you, Danny?",
        "Michelle: You need to go.",
        "Tony: You want him to go home now? But you've been looking for him all day, Michelle. Haven't you? Oh, come on. This is your chance. This is the best chance you've got.",
        "Danny: Take it easy.",
        "Michelle: Stop it. Stop it, Tony.",
        "Tony: Oh, you know you're dying to tell him, so tell him. Tell him.",
        "Danny: What? Tell me what?",
        "Tony: She's in love with you, Danny.",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Tony: Yeah, that's right. That's right. So guess what? It's the big reunion, you two. But you know what? You can't do it, because you already slept together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: You know, lying next to you, I feel so safe. It's like nothing in this world could ever...",
        "Bill: Hurt you?",
        "Olivia: I thought you were sleeping.",
        "Bill: Me, too. In fact, I thought I was going to wake up and you wouldn't really be here.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, I kind of wondered that myself. I didn't expect this, you know? Considering how much we've been arguing about business. About you and Harley.",
        "Bill: Look, I didn't sleep with Harley. Nothing happened.",
        "Olivia: What do you mean, nothing happened?",
        "Bill: Nothing happened. It was a lie.",
        "Olivia: It was a lie?",
        "Bill: Yes. Look, Harley was going to prison. She wanted Gus to move on and she let him believe that we slept together. But we didn't. We really didn't. And I'm sorry, because I never meant to hurt you.",
        "Olivia: You never meant to hurt... why would you do something like that?",
        "Bill: I don't know. I'm just trying to help her, you know? She's my friend and I just thought, all right, I'll go through with this now and I'll explain it to you later. I mean, you can understand that, right?",
        "Olivia: Yeah, sweetie. I understand.",
        "Bill: (Yells)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Alan? Have you seen Gus?",
        "Alan: No. Why?",
        "Alexandra: Because he didn't come home last night.",
        "Alan: Well, he's probably on his one-man crusade trying to save Harley. Of course, he says he's given up on that but you and I both know he's lying.",
        "Alexandra: That's what I want to talk about, you know? Because what if he did find something?",
        "Alan: There's nothing to find.",
        "Alexandra: Well, what if he found something and he's in trouble?",
        "Alan: There is no trouble, because Phillip's killer is behind bars.",
        "Alexandra: You are not 100% sure of that and you know it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Are you there, coward? What a chicken you are. Let a woman go to prison for a crime that you committed. (Groaning) You better not hurt a hair on her head. Stay away from her. I swear... (groaning)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Cooper.",
        "Harley: Mallet. What do you want?",
        "Mallet: I always thought being a warden would get you more respect.",
        "Harley: Well, in my book, you have to earn respect.",
        "Mallet: Well, I was going to make you an offer, but...",
        "Harley: What? What offer?",
        "Mallet: If you get up off your sorry butt, maybe I'll tell you.",
        "Harley: I'm sorry. You'll have to forgive me. I'm a little tired. My boss has been working me overtime every single night.",
        "Mallet: Oh, stop whining. You get to have the best job in this joint.",
        "Harley: What's the offer?",
        "Mallet: I was thinking about last night. You remembering something about the night of Phillip's murder?",
        "Harley: Yeah.",
        "Mallet: Yeah. I'm going to get you out of this place.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Ugh. Ay-yi-yi, why did you do that?",
        "Olivia: You know why.",
        "Bill: For not sleeping with Harley?",
        "Olivia: For making me believe that you did. For putting Harley ahead of me again. You're the one who is determined to destroy this marriage do you know that?",
        "Bill: What are you talking about? I tried to tell you.",
        "Olivia: When?",
        "Bill: When Gus came over and punched me in the face, that's when.",
        "Olivia: Well, what stopped you?",
        "Bill: You did. You never gave me the chance.",
        "Olivia: What do you mean?",
        "Bill: It was killing me.",
        "Olivia: It's my fault?",
        "Bill: Well, no. You're the one who said you couldn't trust me. That's what... you knew that I was going to let you down.",
        "Olivia: Well, you know what? You know what? I was crushed so I was lashing out.",
        "Bill: Lashing... well, I tried to another time, too.",
        "Olivia: Oh, what's your excuse this time?",
        "Bill: That was the day you moved into Alan's mansion.",
        "Olivia: Okay, again, again. Crushed. I wanted to go somewhere...",
        "Bill: Somewhere where you knew I'd hate. That's what you did, and I wanted to tell you.",
        "Olivia: Did you ever stop to think that maybe I belong there?",
        "Bill: No, you don't. Listen to me. You hurt me ... I hurt you. Are we even?",
        "Olivia: This is so ridiculous.",
        "Bill: Look, I should have told you. I am sorry.",
        "Olivia: Yeah. Yeah. You should have. (Cell phone ringing)",
        "Bill: I have to get this. Hello? Hey, Wanda. Is that right? He did? Well, that's just great. Thanks for calling. Hm. Forgot all about business, huh?",
        "Olivia: Excuse me?",
        "Bill: Your plan worked. You lured me back here, kept me occupied...",
        "Olivia: (Laughs) I didn't lure you back here. We came back here together.",
        "Bill: Yeah, Olivia. That property we were fighting over? Seems that Pierce got a last-minute bid from Spaulding. And he accepted it.",
        "Olivia: He did? Yes.",
        "Bill: He did. You're so surprised. Nice work.",
        "Olivia: No. No, no.",
        "Bill: Yeah, yeah. Nice work, yeah.",
        "Olivia: I didn't do this. Alan must have placed the bid.",
        "Bill: Oh, my goodness. And you just ended up in my bed. How convenient. Well, it was great. Why don't you go find Alan and celebrate? See you around.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Alexandra, I don't want to hear any more of this pro-Cooper propaganda.",
        "Alexandra: Alan, this has nothing to do with the Cooper's. I'm worried about Gus. He's driving himself into the ground trying to free Harley, and now he's missing.",
        "Alan: Well, you know what? He is a grown man. He doesn't have to check in with us. Besides, maybe he's found someone new.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, will you stop it? Really. He's 100% devoted to Harley.",
        "Alan: Yeah, well, I am 100% devoted to this slice of pie, which you should try. Don't you worry, sister dearest. This silly investigation of Gus's will end very soon.",
        "Alexandra: And what makes you so sure of that?",
        "Alan: Well, I think Harley is about ready to let him go.",
        "Alexandra: And why would you believe that?",
        "Alan: Because I suggested it to her.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, really. When?",
        "Alan: At prison, yesterday. Right before she strangled me.",
        "Alexandra: You didn't threaten her, did you?",
        "Lizzie: When will you give up?",
        "Alan: Elizabeth.",
        "Lizzie: No, no, no. Don't explain. Okay? I don't care.",
        "Alexandra: Lizzie, were you listening the whole time?",
        "Lizzie: This is my restaurant. I don't want any more talk about my father's murder. Understood? Both of you.",
        "Alexandra: Darling, I'm afraid it's not quite that simple.",
        "Lizzie: It is that simple, okay? I miss my Dad all the time, but he would want me to move on and have a normal life.",
        "Alan: What would make you happy, sweetheart?",
        "Lizzie: I really don't know. Maybe a party?",
        "Alan: Well, if you want a party, I want you to plan it because I will pay for it.",
        "Lizzie: Really?",
        "Alan: Yes.",
        "Lizzie: Thanks, Granddad.",
        "Alan: Oh, well, you're very welcome, sweetheart. Not to worry.",
        "Alexandra: Alan...",
        "Alan: Well, that was very easy, wasn't it?",
        "Alexandra: Yes, but we are going to have to keep even a closer eye on her.",
        "Alan: You know, Alexandra, your concern for family is very touching. First Gus, now Elizabeth.",
        "Alexandra: Yes, and back to Gus. Because I think he's trying to pin Phillip's murder on Olivia, and if he does that, he had better be careful.",
        "Alan: Olivia? Oh. You would love to see her behind bars, wouldn't you? Where are you going?",
        "Alexandra: Talking to you is completely meaningless.",
        "Alan: You know something, Alexandra? You have a bad attitude.",
        "Alexandra: No, I have a bad feeling. About your son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: How many times do I have to tell you? I don't want you involved in my life.",
        "Mallet: Better me than Aitoro. I've done my research. That guy blew your case.",
        "Harley: That is not true. Gus did everything he could to win my case. He believed in me when I didn't believe in myself.",
        "Mallet: He paid off a witness.",
        "Harley: Why are you here? Why are you doing this?",
        "Mallet: Why not?",
        "Harley: If you're trying to make up for what you did, it won't work. Nothing can make up for that.",
        "Mallet: Do my reasons even matter?",
        "Harley: No, because you're trying to get me to trust you.",
        "Mallet: Don't make this more than what it is, okay? All I'm saying is I still think like a cop and that's what you need right now. Unless you want to spend the next 20 years of your life in this place. What's the worst thing that can happen if I help you?",
        "Harley: I've decided to stop answering that question because every time I think the worst thing has happened, it gets worse. For example, I end up in prison. Cut to, my ex-husband.",
        "Mallet: Last chance, Cooper. You tell me what you remembered or I head out of here, I go back to my office and from now on, we're warden and prisoner. Hm? Guard!",
        "Harley: Wait. The perfume. There's that smell, the flowers. I think it was a perfume, like jasmine. And also I remember the sound of a woman's high heels clicking on the pavement. That's it.",
        "Mallet: Okay. Guard.",
        "Harley: What... what are we doing? Mallet? Where are you going? Where are you going?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Take it easy, Tony. It was one time.",
        "Tony: And that's supposed to make it okay?",
        "Danny: We were married at the time, actually.",
        "Tony: Okay... don't give me that, okay? Don't. Is this your way of putting me in my place? Is this what this is, Danny?",
        "Danny: Putting you in your place?",
        "Tony: Oh, yeah. That's right. Because you always thought you were better than me. You always...",
        "Danny: Oh, Tony. Please. That's not true.",
        "Tony: It is true. Even when we were kids, it was always, you know what, Danny, hey, he's the big cheese, Tony's the dumb thug.",
        "Danny: Okay. All right, Tony. You just think whatever you need to think.",
        "Tony: It's all I know, Danny.",
        "Michelle: Tony, look, please don't blame Danny for this. If you want to blame somebody, blame me, okay?",
        "Danny: Michelle.",
        "Tony: I can't blame you, Michelle. You know why? It was him. You had no idea what you were doing.",
        "Michelle: We weren't thinking about it. It's not like we planned it. It just happened.",
        "Tony: No, you're just saying this because everybody else is telling you this. Ray, Rick, everyone.",
        "Michelle: No. No, Tony. It just... it wasn't a planned thing. We couldn't fight it.",
        "Tony: You couldn't fight it. We were so good together. How can you...",
        "Michelle: Listen, we are good together and I'm not lying to you when I say I love you. I do.",
        "Tony: Okay, so what? You just love Danny more, huh? That's what this is?",
        "Michelle: I... I don't... I really don't know. (Crying) I'm sorry, I don't know.",
        "Tony: Well, you know what? It's okay, because all my life, nothing I do matters. Right, Danny? Nothing I do matters. But you know what's sad? Because you're constantly around, you will always be between me and her. As long as you're alive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: You're not going to break me. I've been through a lot worse than this. This one time, I was trapped in an airplane bathroom for 14 hours. Now, that was scary. This is nothing. This is like a vacation to me. And I don't believe you can get near Harley because I've got people watching her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Alexandra?",
        "Alexandra: Hello, darling.",
        "Guard: No touching!",
        "Alexandra: For heaven's sakes. You think I should know better, wouldn't you?",
        "Harley: What are you doing here?",
        "Alexandra: Would you believe I miss the place?",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Alexandra: No, I didn't think so. How are you doing?",
        "Harley: I'm okay. As okay as I can be. Have you seen my father?",
        "Alexandra: I check up on him all the time. He misses you, you know? He'd be here every single day, but he just thinks it would upset you.",
        "Harley: Well, I miss them all so much. I just feel like seeing them or hearing their voices right now would be worse than missing them.",
        "Alexandra: Alan told me he came by to see you.",
        "Harley: Did he?",
        "Alexandra: Mm-hmm. He inferred that he threatened you.",
        "Harley: Well, that's okay. I threatened him, too. Did you notice the marks I left on his throat?",
        "Alexandra: You're tough. You're tough. I'm glad I didn't have you as a cellmate. So, what did he say to you?",
        "Harley: Well, before he started gasping for air, he told me to stay away from Gus, or else.",
        "Alexandra: Or else what?",
        "Harley: Or else he would get to me. Hurt me. Even in here. Especially in here.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, Alan.",
        "Harley: It doesn't matter. It's okay.",
        "Alexandra: No, it isn't.",
        "Harley: I'm not afraid of him, Alex. Really. But I need you to do something for me.",
        "Alexandra: Anything. What?",
        "Harley: Are you wearing perfume?",
        "Alexandra: Yes.",
        "Harley: What do you call it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Oh, and hey, listen. There's an extra $50 if you can get it here within 20 minutes. Yeah. Okay, great. See you then.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: How do you feel about palm trees around our pool?",
        "Alan: Very festive.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, but very expensive. It costs a lot of money.",
        "Alan: Now, don't you worry about the money. I've got plenty of it.",
        "Lizzie: Thanks, Granddad.",
        "Mallet: Alan Spaulding?",
        "Alan: Yes.",
        "Mallet: Ah, that's what I thought. You look younger in the papers.",
        "Lizzie: Well, that was rude.",
        "Alan: (Chuckles)",
        "Mallet: Oh, and you must be Phillip and Beth's kid.",
        "Alan: Is there something I can do for you, Mr....",
        "Mallet: Yes, as a matter of fact there is.",
        "Lizzie: Who are you?",
        "Mallet: Oh, I skipped that part, didn't I?",
        "Lizzie: Oh.",
        "Mallet: A.C. Mallet.",
        "Alan: A.C. Mallet. Well, we've never met but I've heard you're back in the area. It's nice to meet you.",
        "Mallet: I can't say the same. I've heard a few too many stories.",
        "Alan: Well, you can't always believe what you hear.",
        "Mallet: Well, I do believe in giving people a chance, so we'll see.",
        "Lizzie: What is his problem?",
        "Alan: Elizabeth? A moment, please?",
        "Lizzie: Excuse me.",
        "Mallet: Cute kid. Raising her in your image?",
        "Alan: Now, look; you didn't come here just to insult me and my family, did you?",
        "Mallet: No, but it's been fun. You see, I review the surveillance tapes every day in the prison, and I saw you talk your way past my guard--or pay your way.",
        "Alan: If you're referring to my visit to Harley Cooper, she happens to be the mother of my grandson.",
        "Mallet: Yeah. Well, don't try to sell me that \"concerned grandpa\" bit. It's common knowledge you twisted every arm between here and the state capital to get Harley convicted of Phillip's murder.",
        "Alan: I was merely seeking justice.",
        "Mallet: Really? Stay out of my prison and stay away from Harley, capice?",
        "Alan: Indeed I do. And I must say, Mr. Mallet, I couldn't have asked for a better reaction if I'd paid for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: I can't find my shirt.",
        "Bill: So?",
        "Olivia: So, I have to get dressed.",
        "Bill: A little late to be shy now. I just saw you naked ten minutes ago.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, well, I hope you got a good look because it's the last one you're ever going to get.",
        "Bill: You tricked me.",
        "Olivia: No. No. I didn't trick you. How many times do I have to say it? I needed you, okay? I have needed you for weeks and the first chance you get to doubt me, that's what you do.",
        "Bill: So you didn't really set me up?",
        "Olivia: I need you. You have no idea what I've been going through.",
        "Bill: What do you mean, what you've been going through?",
        "Olivia: In that house. I thought I could handle it. I thought I could handle them.",
        "Bill: I'll tell you what. Why don't we go get a drink, all right? We'll try to figure all this out. All right? I'll even let you borrow one of my shirts.",
        "Olivia: I'd like that.",
        "Bill: Good. Good. Then go get dressed and we'll get out of here, okay? Oh. You forgot something. (Knock at door)",
        "Vanessa: Darling.",
        "Bill: Mom.",
        "Vanessa: Surprise.",
        "Bill: Mom. Mom, Mom, Mom. Mom.",
        "Vanessa: It's so good to see you.",
        "Bill: What are you doing here?",
        "Vanessa: Oh. Well, hello to you, too. I'm just on a visit. Long overdue, don't you think?",
        "Bill: Well, yeah, most definitely. Most definitely. And... what, you're here to see Dinah, though. Is that it?",
        "Vanessa: Well, sure, but I'm also here to see you.",
        "Bill: Yeah. Yeah, and that's great, too. I'm so happy. Yes, I'm so happy.",
        "Vanessa: Good. So nice to see you, honey.",
        "Bill: Yes, you too.",
        "Vanessa: Now, listen. Your Daddy told me that... Billy said that you and Olivia are separated?",
        "Bill: Oh, he told you that did he? I'm sure he's still celebrating the fact, hm?",
        "Vanessa: Oh, no, no. He's very concerned and so am I, but it's all right because I'm going to help you through it.",
        "Bill: Really? Well, Mom, right...",
        "Olivia: Bill, have you seen my panties anywhere?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: You know what? Why don't I take Michelle home?",
        "Tony: Where are going to take her, Danny, huh? Where are you going to take her? My place? Your place? Maybe you want to take your house back from me, too. Huh?",
        "Michelle: Tony. Tony, Danny doesn't want to hurt you any more than I do.",
        "Tony: Michelle, I don't want to hear it! He cares nothing about me!",
        "Michelle: That is not true. You guys are like brothers. You know that.",
        "Tony: Danny, are we like brothers? Do you care about me like a brother? Do you love me like a brother? Do you?",
        "Danny: Yeah, Tony.",
        "Tony: Really? Okay, then back off and let me be happy with Michelle. Please.",
        "Danny: I have backed off. Michelle is free to do whatever she wants to do.",
        "Tony: No, she's not free to do anything she wants to do, with you around. Nothing. Danny, look at me. I love her, okay? You are everything to me. She's everything to me. I'm asking you, please, just let me be happy with her. Don't take that away from me, Danny.",
        "Danny: Tony, Michelle was everything to me, too.",
        "Tony: This is... what are you doing to me, man? What is this pay back? What are you doing to me?",

        "Harley: No, it's not. May I smell that again? That's not jasmine.",

        "Alan: Me? Harass Harley? Now, you were watching the tapes. She almost killed me.",
        "Mallet: I have to admit I did rewind it a couple of times. It's pretty good. You know, I never could figure out how someone Harley's size could be so strong.",

        "Mallet: And you think that would make me happy?",

        "Olivia: No, no, no. It's not a problem, really. I mean your mother and I are just sizing each other up. It's what we women do, right?",

        "Alexandra: Yes, but... darling, you know, your father's death affected so many people. I mean, your grandfather, your Uncle Gus, the Cooper's, me. Our world has changed, as we know it.",

        "Vanessa: I am.",
        "Bill: Why?",
        "Vanessa: Because I've been in Olivia's shoes, and I know what she wants. And I'm telling you, as someone who loves you very much, that when it comes to her child, her career and her marriage, you are always going to come in a distant third.",
        "Bill: Always? Well, that's pretty harsh from someone who managed to have all three of those things.",
