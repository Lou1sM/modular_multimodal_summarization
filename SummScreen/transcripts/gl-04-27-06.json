Jeffrey discovers that Ross's assistant, Nicole, was an investigator and has a female partner of 10 years. He realizes that Ross wasn't having an affair. Blake gets in his car as he is leaving and suddenly comes on to him. They kiss and the passion gets heated. She suddenly slaps him and tells him that she is trying to get over Ross and he is trying to get over Cassie. Also, her brain is shut-off sometimes. They end up debating the campaign issues and tell the other they are adamant about not dropping out of the mayoral race.",

What? No, I'm not okay. I am pregnant and I don't know where the father is. Find Coop or file for unemployment. ( Knock on the door ) Oh, Coop, thank you God.",
        "Beth: Hello, sweetie, how are you on this beautiful, spring morning, hmm?",
        "Lizzie: What if he's never coming back, Mom? What if he's gone for good.",

        "Buzz: You tell me your concern and I'll tell you mine, okay.",
        "Alan: Your son has a chance of a lifetime, Buzz, to attend Oxford University, probably the best university in the English world. They believe in him, and they want him to shoot for the stars. I know you're proud of him--",
        "Buzz: What's your point?",
        "Alan: My point is the last thing he needs right now is to be saddled with a child. Now you and I were young and we know accidents happen, and I think you and I should make sure Elizabeth and Henry learn from this mistake and move on. Put this indiscretion behind them.",

        "Ava: How do you know that?",
        "Jonathan: Tammy.",
        "Ava: So Lizzie says she's pregnant, and Coop's the father. Why should I believe her?",
        "Jonathan: Why shouldn't you?",
        "Ava: It's too easy, too Lizzie. She loses him-- and poof-- all of a sudden she's pregnant.",
        "Jonathan: Wake up and get over it, Ava. Coop's going to be a daddy. You just got to let him go and let Lizzie have him.",
        "Ava: What are you, her new best friend?",

        "Jonathan: About Lizzie and Coop? They're both freaks. What is that look?",
        "Ava: You spent a little time with Lizzie when you and Tammy broke up. You know something.",

        "Beth: Thanks.",
        "Lizzie: I mean, it's fine, but who cares what you look like at this point. But me, in one of those tent dresses and those shoes. And everybody touching you all of the time, is it a boy, is it a girl, is it triplets?",
        "Beth: You will handle it?",
        "Lizzie: Maybe, but all alone.",
        "Beth: No.",
        "Lizzie: Yes. Coop blew the coop, and now I'm all alone.",
        "Beth: And Coop will come back. But in the meantime...",
        "Lizzie: I know, I know, I have you. It's not enough.",
        "Beth: I wasn't a big fan of you and Coop, but that baby needs a mother and a father. And I'm going to make sure that he or she gets it if it's the last thing I do.",

        "Lizzie: So you're going to help me find Coop?",
        "Beth: First of all, I don't think I'll have to, because I think that once the shock wears off, he'll come back. He's a decent young man.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Buzz, Buzz, come on. You don't have to get defensive. Now I admit that I blamed young Coop for everything in the very beginning, but I realize now that he's a very intelligent and talented young man. Apparently Oxford shares in my opinion.",
        "Buzz: Why isn't this fine young man good enough to raise your grandchild? Frank, hi. Look, I want you to-- don't hang up! I want you to uh... check on something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: You haven't missed a thing. She's just upset because Coop pulled a Houdini as soon as she heard about the baby.",

        "Tammy: Wait, Ava. Ava, what makes you think she's making this up?",
        "Ava: Well, I don't trust her. I mean, are you surprised? Something about this situation it's not right.",
        "Jonathan: Wishful thinking. Eggs, now.",
        "Tammy: I guess anything is possible with Lizzie, but I don't know. Lizzie, maternity clothes. No way. No, not unless--",
        "Ava: Not unless... not unless she is pregnant, actually. I would believe that if--",
        "Tammy: If what?",
        "Ava: If, if, if-- what if she did this to set up Coop, to trap him? What if he's not the father?",

        "Josh: Any other hobbies?",

        "Cassie: Why didn't you just come right out and ask him if he likes kids?",
        "Josh: Hey, he seems like a nice guy. It'd be nice to have a doctor in the family, don't you think?",
        "Cassie: In the family?",

        "Cassie: You're saying? You're just saying you think that I'm the kind of woman who can't exist without a man in my life.",
        "Josh: No, that's not at all what I think. And I apologize, okay. I will never try to play cupid again.",
        "Cassie: All right, I'm sorry if I was snipee. That doctor was cute, I mean if you're into that type.",
        "Josh: Are you? I'll take that as a no.",
        "Cassie: Josh, I am doing just fine. I am very happy with my kids and my good friends, and new adventures. I'm great.",

        "Cassie: Blake or Jeffrey? Um, well, actually, I haven't decided who I'm going to vote for yet. I... I can tell you that I know them both very well, and I happen to trust them both. I hope that answers your question.",

        "Jeffrey: Sounds like we both have our regrets.",
        "Cassie: But we're both moving forward, right? I'm working on this new project with Josh that I think it's really going to help a lot of people. And you, look at you, you're really coming out of your shell and running for mayor, going to talk to people and be nice.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm going to talk to people. No one told me about the nice part. I'm not sure about that.",
        "Cassie: Well, I think you're going to do just fine.",
        "Jeffrey: Because of all that you did for me.",

        "Coop: Pop, listen...",
        "Buzz: Come on, being a family man, being married drove me crazy. It drove me so crazy I left my son, I left my wife, I chose to fight a war instead of fighting for my family.",
        "Coop: Pop, what I'm trying...",
        "Buzz: Look, you do this, you make this choice, you get on that plane, you can never go back. You listening to what I'm saying.",

        "Coop: I just came here to see if I could get a refund if it turns out that I can't accept, if I have to give up on this Oxford.",
        "Buzz: First of all, you're not going to have to give up on anything.",
        "Coop: It's just a thought, okay, just an option.",
        "Buzz: You slept here?",
        "Coop: I just needed to drive somewhere. I need to do something. I got here and I felt like I could barely even breathe. I didn't know what was going on, I didn't know what I was going to do, I didn't know what was coming next. So I just sat down. I needed time. I looked around. I saw people, I saw all these strangers going somewhere, doing something. They were all starting out on their adventures. And, you know, it's like I felt like one of them. Even if it was just for like a moment or even two. It's like I felt...",

        "Olivia: Oh, God, cue the violins.",
        "Ava: What?",
        "Olivia: Listen, we've had our differences, but I don't hate you, okay? In fact, I'm kind of impressed of how well you've handled life since you've been here.",
        "Ava: Well, I'm not feeling that impressive right now.",
        "Olivia: Is this about Lizzie and Coop and the baby? That's some announcement, huh?",

        "Olivia: You think Lizzie is lying?",
        "Ava: It's not that much of a leap.",

        "Lizzie: You know what, that's how it happened. Things happen for a reason.",
        "Ava: If you really care about Coop, really care about him, then you'll tell the truth, Lizzie, and you'll let him off the hook. Tell the truth. He deserves it.",
        "Lizzie: I already did. I'm pregnant. It's Coop's. I didn't try to trap anyone. Henry and I were in love... are in love, and our baby came from that love.",

        "Ava: Yeah, a mother. What kind of mother do you think she's going to be?",
        "Olivia: I don't know. You know, good mothers aren't always born that way. People thought I'd be a lousy mother, I'm doing okay. I'm going to give Lizzie the benefit of the doubt.",
        "Lizzie: Thank you, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: On the other hand, I know what it's like to be on the receiving end of the Spaulding power play. It's not fun. I just hope you won't use this baby to hurt anyone, Lizzie.",

        "Ava: Stole my keys?",
        "Jonathan: What's this world coming to? She wanted to break into your room and dig up dirt on you. I told her to keep the car, keep the cash prizes, keep the hell away. You proud of me?",

        "Cassie: I can be when it's for a good cause. Which reminds me, the best part wasn't even renovating the place for Reva's surprise. It was actually that Josh found these plans that his father had drawn up for a rehabilitation community/hospital for injured soldiers. It's a great project, and he wants to build it on part of the property.",
