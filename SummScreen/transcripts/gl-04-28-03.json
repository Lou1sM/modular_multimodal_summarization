        "Alan: What did you just say?",
        "Gus: I am your son. That's why you're here. That's why we took you in. That's why we're protecting you. I know this must be a shock for you. It shocked the hell out of me. None of this would be happening if Alexandra hadn't arranged for us not to know about each other. She robbed us of years. She'd still keep this lie going if she had the chance. But the truth is the truth. You're my father, Alan.",
        "Alan: That's not the truth. It's a big lie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eden: (Sighs)",
        "Frank: Let's try this again. It's a simple question. How did your business card end up in the pocket of a dead man?",
        "Eden: I don't know. Maybe the victim put it there himself. Half the guys in this town have my card.",
        "Frank: I don't.",
        "Eden: Yeah, well, you want one? Okay, maybe not.",
        "Frank: You still haven't answered my question.",
        "Eden: What was the question again?",
        "Frank: His name was Dr. Jed Simmons. He was the County Coroner. Have you heard of him? And before you answer the question, I want you to think long and hard about the answer because if I get the impression that you're not being straight with me, I might have to ask myself why, and then I'm going to have to look at your past activities this week, including everything there is to know about your business. And I doubt very much you would want that to happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ben: Hey.",
        "Ramona: Hi.",
        "Ben: I came as soon as I could. You know, this is an unusual day...",
        "Ramona: No, no. It wasn't that kind of call.",
        "Ben: You mean, you called me over here just to talk?",
        "Ramona: Oh, Benjamin, you know that I love action more than talk. I hope it's okay.",
        "Ben: Ramona, you didn't...",
        "Ramona: I did. You see that red package in the parking lot?",
        "Ben: The convertible?",
        "Ramona: Mm-hmm. It reminded me of you. See, I told you, when I make an offer, I always follow through. I told you to go down to the dealership and pick out one for yourself.",
        "Ben: It was... It was just too much, you know, and I've been really busy.",
        "Ramona: Oh. Too busy to pick up a free car?",
        "Ben: I wasn't really anxious to run into your husband.",
        "Ramona: Well, his company does own the dealership. Come on, Benjamin. Don't be so serious. Just think of the car as, you know, a token of my appreciation. And I am very, very appreciative.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Knocking at door)",
        "Shayne: Hey, anybody home? Marah? Anybody home?",
        "Marina: Hey. Nobody here but us chickens. How did you get in?",
        "Shayne: Because the door was unlocked.",
        "Marina: Ah. I'm waiting for Ben, who's late, again. I'm kind of glad you came here, though. I was getting a little creeped out here all by myself, you know? I mean, it feels like it was just yesterday that you rescued me from the boogeyman.",
        "Shayne: Well, you know what? It was just yesterday. And it wasn't a boogeyman, it was some drug-dealing lowlife.",
        "Marina: Anyway, well, I think I'm going to need your rescuing again. This time you need to save me from being bored to death.",
        "Shayne: I think I can do that.",
        "Marina: That's good. With Ben pulling disappearing acts all the time, this can very well become a permanent gig.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Hey.",
        "Michelle: Well, there's a first time for everything.",
        "Rick: Yeah, yeah. My first visit to your new castle.",
        "Michelle: Not that, you dope. I mean you being late for a meal.",
        "Rick: Well, I got a new job. I can't slack off.",
        "Michelle: Aw.",
        "Ed: Hey, buddy.",
        "Rick: Hey, Dad.",
        "Ed: How is the new job?",
        "Rick: It's going good. It's going really good, yeah.",
        "Michelle: Hey, are you wearing new cologne?",
        "Rick: No, it's just the soap I use and my natural scent.",
        "Ed: You've got to work on some new material, you know?",
        "Rick: You think so?",
        "Ed: Yeah.",
        "Michelle: No, it's something different. It's, like... It's familiar. It's like high school or, like, biology. I see frogs... It's formaldehyde! Wow, you must be driving the girls crazy. Poor Mel.",
        "Ed: Poor you. That was pretty pathetic. She waited all day to tell that insipid joke.",
        "Michelle: It was pretty good, though, huh? Come on in.",
        "Rick: Whoa. Whoa. Very impressive, Michelle.",
        "Michelle: You like?",
        "Rick: I mean, what's not to like? You could fit the first floor of our house in this room.",
        "Michelle: It's not that big.",
        "Rick: Oh, by the way, where's Danny? Did he lose his way from the kitchen?",
        "Michelle: No. He had a meeting on the redevelopment project. He'll be here soon.",
        "Rick: Oh. I mean, you must miss him being a gangster. I mean, at least then he kept regular hours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tony: Nothing yet. This is it, right?",
        "Danny: Yeah, we're here.",
        "Tony: What I meant was, is this it? You made this huge show of getting out-- for you, for Michelle, for me, for everyone down here. You've made a lot of promises, Danny, but here we are.",
        "Danny: Tony...",
        "Tony: Danny, look, I have your back, you know that. But I'm just getting started with Marah, and I cannot go back to this. You've got to be straight with me. Is this it?",
        "Danny: Tony, we wouldn't be here if it wasn't. All right? Look, this is where we turn the page and close the book on everything that came before. You have my word.",
        "Tony: How long do you figure?",
        "Danny: We'll know soon enough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ed: Unbelievable.",
        "Rick: Hm?",
        "Ed: I could never have found my way back without her.",
        "Rick: That and the birdseed showed our way back.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, seriously, though, I think the whole echo thing was much funnier the first time Dad did it.",
        "Ed: Yeah.",
        "Rick: Well, that's pretty flattering. Rick's amazing... amazing... amazing... amazing... amazing...",
        "Ed: Oh, please. Hey, do you know they got a St. Bernard so they don't have to worry about getting lost?",
        "Michelle: Boy, I had no idea that I was related to the funniest father and son comedy team in all of Springfield. You guys are on a roll.",
        "Ed: Hey.",
        "Michelle: You know what it is? You guys just can't stand that I don't share the same address with you anymore.",
        "Ed: Oh, she's onto us.",
        "Rick: Yeah, we're just covering our pain with our humor, that's all.",
        "Michelle: Well, stop it already because even birds leave the nest, too.",
        "Ed: Hey, did you hear that? Leave the nest?",
        "Rick: It was your idea to move back, by the way. Michelle, you have no idea how bad it is at home. I mean, not only is dad not paying any rent, but he makes these sandwiches a hungry coyote couldn't keep down.",
        "Michelle: You love sandwiches. It's the perfect food for you. And Mel is a good cook.",
        "Rick: Mel's a fine cook, she's okay, but she doesn't understand my cuisine needs.",
        "Michelle: You'll live, you'll live.",
        "Rick: Yeah, I guess. I just, I don't know... I mean, I just never pictured you in a place like this.",
        "Michelle: You know I've always loved this house.",
        "Ed: I remember. You know, I've got a daughter with a brand-new house, a son with a new job. It's a nice time to be a Bauer.",
        "Michelle: It is a nice time to be a Bauer.",
        "Rick: If we're done with our \"Brady Bunch\" moment, can we eat? I'm starving.",
        "Michelle: I want to give you a tour of the other wing first.",
        "Rick: Wing? Wing. That's such a pretentious thing to say, Michelle.",
        "Ed: Oh, come on. Let me do the honors. And when we come back, I'll take you through the wing that's got the kitchen, because that's where the food is.",
        "Michelle: Okay, but you look and no touching. No touching when you're in that kitchen, you understand?",
        "Rick: I'm not going to touch anything.",
        "(Knocking on door)",
        "Michelle: I'll get that. Danny, did you forget your...",
        "Bill: Danny's not here now?",
        "Michelle: He'll be back soon.",
        "Bill: But he's not here.",
        "Michelle: No.",
        "Bill: Good, because that'll give us a chance to get something straight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: I can't get this song out of my head. Does this ever happen to you?",
        "Tony: You've got music in your head at a time like this?",
        "Danny: I can't help it. I'm sorry.",
        "Tony: What is it?",
        "Danny: I can't think of what it is. It's completely inappropriate. It's one of those happy songs that Michelle loves.",
        "Man: Can I do something for you, man?",
        "Danny: Yeah, I think so. (Moans)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shayne: I think I've got to get going.",
        "Marina: What?",
        "Shayne: I've got some stuff to do.",
        "Marina: No, you can't leave me. You told me that you were going to stay here. What could possibly be more important than me?",
        "Shayne: I've got to hit the practice field.",
        "Marina: It's dark outside.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, well, the invention of electricity has made it possible for me to practice 24/7. You know, they got those big lights. You can run all around...",
        "Marina: Shut up. You're a natural. You don't need to practice.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, well, if I don't put some more bite into my fast ball, I'm not even going to be starting next week.",
        "Marina: What? That's not fair.",
        "Shayne: The coach says fair is for losers. And you know what? If I can't impress him, then how am I supposed to impress the pro scouts? Hm? He's, like, you know, one of those movie coaches who sees how much potential you have and he feels like he's got to push you really hard because it's going to take you all the way to the big leagues or something. But, I mean, tough love or no, he can't bench you. That would be ridiculous. No, he can. And he will. You know, I know what I need to do. I just can't do it.",
        "Marina: Well, with an attitude like that, no wonder. You know, when I get, like, really close to something I want, sometimes I start psyching myself out. You know, I get really jittery. I don't know, maybe that's the case with you. Maybe it's just all in your head.",
        "Shayne: Try a little lower.",
        "Marina: Shayne.",
        "Shayne: The coach says there's a problem with my stance. He says there's a definite spin on my follow-through and I can't see it no matter what I do. I don't know what he's talking about.",
        "Marina: Oh, well, you know, maybe I can help. But I think I'd have to see it. All right, come on, show me.",
        "Shayne: Am I missing something? What? See?",
        "Marina: You know what? You know what? Actually, I think I did see something. I don't know, I think I'd have to feel it, though.",
        "Shayne: How do you propose we do that?",
        "Marina: Just come on. All right. Get in your stance. What are you waiting for? Ball. All right. Okay, now wind up. Okay, okay. Did you feel that? I felt that. Did you?",
        "Shayne: Uh-uh.",
        "Marina: Okay, well, try it again. Yay. Okay, that was better. Did you see? You held steady that time. Did it feel better to you?",
        "Shayne: A little bit. Let's do it again.",
        "Marina: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ramona: So listen, you keep the tank full-- just in case.",
        "Ben: I don't know what to say. Marah, hi.",
        "Marah: Hi. I was just dropping Tammy and the boys off.",
        "Ramona: Hello.",
        "Ben: Mrs. Hendon, this is my friend Marah Lewis. Marah, this is my boss, Mrs. Hendon.",
        "Ramona: Oh, please, call me Ramona. Mrs. Hendon makes me sound like someone's mother. Speaking of which, I'm a very big fan of your mother's.",
        "Marah: Oh. Well, thanks.",
        "Ben: So is everybody back at the house for the thing?",
        "Marah: The thing?",
        "Ben: You know, the thing tonight.",
        "Marah: Yeah, right. That thing. Um, yeah, actually everybody's just waiting for you, and I have to... I was just getting some food.",
        "Ramona: Well, it seems that you are busy this evening, Benjamin, so we'll just reschedule.",
        "Ben: All right.",
        "Ramona: Okay? It's a pleasure meeting you.",
        "Ben: Bye-bye. Okay, that is not what it looked like.",
        "Marah: Well, good, because it looked like you were kissing your boss.",
        "Ben: She drinks, all right, and she gets a little affectionate. That is all it was. There's nothing going on between us except for business, I swear. Come on, Marah. You know me.",
        "Marah: Yeah, that doesn't exactly help your case.",
        "Ben: I need this job.",
        "Marah: This is sexual harassment.",
        "Ben: She is a nice lady. She just... She just has a problem, but I can handle her. I know I can.",
        "Marah: You know what? If it was just you alone that was in this...",
        "Ben: I would never jeopardize what's going on between me and Marina. She is the one thing, she's the one person that... She means a lot to me. But if she knew about this, she'd want me to quit. And, Marah, I need your help here.",
        "Marah: You need me to cover for you.",
        "Ben: Yes, I do.",
        "Marah: Don't hurt her, Ben.",
        "Ben: I won't. I promise. You know, when we were going out, I didn't know what a good thing was. And I will not make the same mistake twice.",
        "Marah: All right. I will keep quiet. This time.",
        "Ben: Okay. That's all I'm asking.",
        "Marah: Now, I'm going to go back to the museum. Do you need a lift?",
        "Ben: No, no. I got my own wheels. I'll be right behind you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eden: You know, Frank, I want this town to be safe just as much as anyone else does, but I don't know how I can help you. I mean, my card is all over town. And just because someone has my business card, doesn't mean that they use it. And this Jed Simmons guy, he never made that call.",
        "Frank: Well, I'm sure some of your customers don't use their real names.",
        "Eden: I don't like what you're implying.",
        "Frank: If a client uses a credit card, we can track his movement, regardless of what name he uses.",
        "Eden: What do you want?",
        "Frank: I want to look at your clients' records.",
        "Eden: If I open up my records to you, I can kiss my business good-bye. I'm legit, Frank, but I sell privacy.",
        "Frank: Okay. Thanks for your cooperation. I guess I'll be getting that court order now.",
        "Eden: You don't have enough to get one. Look, I want you to solve this case, but you can't walk all over me to do it.",
        "Frank: You just answer the question: Does this guy look familiar to you or not? And whatever answer you give me, I'll keep you and your business out of it for right now?",
        "Eden: Never saw him in my life.",
        "Frank: Then I promise you, you'll be seeing a lot more of me. I guarantee it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: I know you don't like me and I know Harley doesn't like me either. But what you have done is set me up.",
        "Gus: You were set up-- but not by me.",
        "Alan: Then by whom?",
        "Gus: Your sister. The will. If I'm assuming correctly, your father probably wrote something about lines of succession, so your sister had to neutralize you to make sure that Phillip was put in as the head of the company.",
        "Alan: I would have done that myself eventually. What's the urgency?",
        "Gus: Well, when the truth came out-- if the truth came out-- Phillip would already be in position.",
        "Alan: Position for what?",
        "Gus: Alan, the best offense is an active defense. You have another heir. Me. And unlike Phillip, I'm a blood relative. And Alexandra, she wouldn't want someone like me anywhere near the company. But here I am. So she doesn't win.",
        "Alan: And neither did you. You're no Spaulding. And you're no son of mine.",
        "Harley: No. No! I will not let you do this to him. Alan. Alan, don't... don't let your stupid pride get in the way of the best thing that's happened to you in a long time. You've blown through all your chances with your other sons. Don't start out like this with Gus.",
        "Gus: Honey, you don't have to...",
        "Harley: No. No, no, no, no, no. You have been... He has been to hell and back trying to figure out where he came from. He went halfway around the world for some of those answers, and at the end of that long road, he gets you? If you think you're some sort of prize, Alan, think again. He didn't have to... It would have been easy for him to keep this thing a secret, to not deal with somebody like you, but he couldn't do that because he couldn't watch you disintegrate. He had to step up and help you because that's the kind of man that he is. He risked everything-- his badge-- to help you. Now, you look at what your family did to you and you look at what he has done for you, and you tell me who your real family is. Why would he help you? Why not? What could he possibly have to gain?",
        "Alan: Plenty. You're in it for the money.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: You don't want Danny to hear what you have to say?",
        "Bill: Relax, Michelle. I'm not here to profess my undying love.",
        "Michelle: No, I didn't think that... I just don't think that anything has been so awkward between us since... Wow, it used to be so easy. I really hate this.",
        "Bill: I know. Me, too. And that is... That is why I'm here, okay? Because I wanted to say that I'm sorry.",
        "Michelle: You're sorry?",
        "Bill: Yes.",
        "Michelle: For what?",
        "Bill: For being a jerk.",
        "Michelle: Hey, you had every right to...",
        "Bill: Michelle, look. You made your choice, okay? You're with Danny and I respect that. I do. It's just that when you came in and you made the big announcement... I mean, I should be used to you two getting married by now, but I just, I don't know, I just wasn't ready for it.",
        "Michelle: You didn't expect us to waltz into our new house and drop a big bomb like that.",
        "Bill: Well, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter anymore because it ends here. Okay? Because I can see that you're happy, you're really happy, and well, it's great to see. I know with me you were trying to be happy, but...",
        "Michelle: No, no, I...",
        "Bill: Michelle, okay, if we're going to be anything to each other, you're going to have to start being honest with me again, okay?",
        "Michelle: Okay. Well, you're still the best, and I've missed my best friend.",
        "Bill: Well, I missed mine, too. And who knows, maybe this time around, it'll be even better.",
        "Michelle: Yeah. I wish I could just snap my fingers and make all the awkwardness go away, but I know it's not going to be that easy.",
        "Bill: Hey. Easy is boring. But there is something.",
        "Michelle: Anything. What?",
        "Bill: Your dream house here could use a little work, and I thought maybe I could be the one to give you a hand. I mean, that is if you'd let me. I... Well, I guess that is a yes.",
        "Michelle: And I guess that your timing of this apology has nothing to do with you finding a new girl?",
        "Bill: Oh, you heard about me and Eden?",
        "Michelle: Bill.",
        "Bill: What?",
        "Michelle: Eden August?",
        "Bill: What? She's not what you think.",
        "Michelle: Oh, she's not...",
        "Bill: No.",
        "Michelle: Okay, all right. I mean, as long as you're happy, I'm happy. That's all that matters.",
        "Bill: All right. (Knocking at door)",
        "Frank: Hey, Michelle.",
        "Michelle: Hi.",
        "Frank: How are you? Wow. I really feel sorry you have to live like this.",
        "Michelle: Not you, too.",
        "Frank: You guys couldn't find anything bigger? (Laughter)",
        "Michelle: Come on, what's going on?",
        "Frank: If I could just talk to that sorry excuse for a brother you have there. I don't mean to interrupt you.",
        "Michelle: The more the merrier. No problem.",
        "Frank: Hey, Ed.",
        "Ed: How are you?",
        "Frank: Long time, no see.",
        "Rick: Hey, buddy.",
        "Frank: Hey, buddy.",
        "Rick: That's Mr. Medical Examiner to you.",
        "Frank: Yeah, really. Can I talk to you for just a second here? Just to kind of give you an update here.",
        "Rick: What's up?",
        "Frank: I questioned Eden about your predecessor's death. She said she didn't know him.",
        "Rick: What do you think?",
        "Frank: I think she's lying.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Grunts and groans)",
        "Danny: Tony... (Coughing) Let's go. I think they got the message.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Laughter)",
        "Marah: Look at this. I didn't rent a museum, I rented a gym. Did anybody even mention to you guys that you two don't even live here?",
        "Shayne: We're just hanging out. Relax. You know what else? Remy's the one who brought in all this equipment.",
        "Marina: Yeah.",
        "Marah: Yeah. What are you doing here?",
        "Marina: Waiting for Ben.",
        "Shayne: And I'm keeping her company.",
        "Marah: Right. Well, you know what? You can help me unload some of these and make yourself useful.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, but I don't live here, remember?",
        "Marah: Oh, but you have no problem eating our food.",
        "Shayne: All right. In a minute. I just want to say thanks again, okay? You know how much it means to me, and you know what? I could not have done it without you. I couldn't have.",
        "Marina: Oh, please. I already told you, you're a natural, all right? You don't need my help. All you got to do, you've just got to stop playing from up there and start playing from there. That's where the real heat is. Me, I don't know, I'm just... I'm the exact opposite, you know? I'm heart, all heart, always, no matter what. Ah. Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben... What was your last name again? \"A waste of my time.\"",
        "Ben: I know, I know. But I'm gong to spend the rest of the night making it up to you.",
        "Marina: That's what you always do. You know, you were so late Shayne and I were starting to make our own plans.",
        "Ben: Shayne.",
        "Marina: Yes. He was kind enough to keep me company. We were working on his pitching motion and I think we fixed it. We were going to go grab a bite to eat to celebrate.",
        "Ben: Hm. Well, you should do that. I mean, it's not everyday a boy learns how to pitch.",
        "Marina: Oh, you want me to go?",
        "Ben: Go. Uh, yeah.",
        "Marina: Fine. Don't think I won't go.",
        "Ben: I know, but there's one thing you should know first?",
        "Marina: What?",
        "Ben: I wasn't just working today. I had to pick something up.",
        "Marina: Okay, so not only now does work come first, but obviously, like, your laundry or whatever it is, too. Great. Thanks, Ben.",
        "Ben: Go look outside.",
        "Marina: What?",
        "Ben: Just humor me. Come on, go.",
        "Marina: Okay. All I see is a really obnoxious red convertible neither of us could ever afford. What am I supposed to be looking at?",
        "Ben: That's it. What do you think?",
        "Marina: Uh, yeah, I think it's great if you're into, you know, stupid, overpriced status symbols, which obviously you are, so you can impress your stupid bosses. So, what? You stood me up so you could haggle with the dealer? That's great. Ben, that's really great. And my present is supposed to be, what? Now I get to, like, ride around in your car with you, which is just going to ultimately drive you further away from me.",
        "Ben: I have a lot to make up for, don't I?",
        "Marina: Well, you should have thought about that before you bought the car.",
        "Ben: I bought the car, but not for me. I bought it for you. (Laughter)",

        "Alan: So you cook up a little orphan Gus story, and I'm to be the Daddy Warbucks, is that it? I don't think so. Then you have Harley, the true-blue Cooper that she is, defend you. That's a very nice touch.",
        "Harley: My God, you're unbelievable. You assume because you have no moral code, that no one else does either.",
        "Alan: No. Detective Aitoro saw an opportunity and he went for it, that's all.",
        "Gus: All right, all right, all right! Enough, enough, enough, enough. Look, Alan, you don't have to believe me, okay? I was a jerk to you. You've been a jerk to me. But it's important that you understand I don't want anything from you. Nothing. And definitely nothing material.",
        "Alan: Then what do you want?",
        "Gus: I want to know you. You know? I want you to know me.",
        "Alan: (Chuckles) What have you been doing, writing greeting cards in your spare time?",
        "Gus: Let me tell you a little story. You were a young man. Phillip, he was a little boy. This is back in Chicago. And you were climbing your way up through your company. You and your wife were having some difficulty, so you looked outside your marriage for some comfort.",
        "Alan: I don't have to listen to this fiction anymore.",
        "Gus: She was a beautiful, beautiful young woman and she was always around.",
        "Alan: You're spinning it! Why don't you just give it up, Aitoro?",
        "Harley: You know what? You don't need this. Honey, you don't need this. You don't need this. You don't need him. You have family. You have me and the boys, and if he doesn't want to deal with you, fine. To hell with him!",

Look, it is about a client of yours, Jed Simmons. No, he didn't call. As a matter of fact, he will never call again. Look, this is very important. You never met him, okay? And I mean never.",

        "Alan: That's never going to happen. You know what's sad about this? You seem to actually believe what you're saying. Are you that desperate and hard-up for a father figure to let a few chess lessons turn into something more? Sounds like you did have a pretty raw deal. Also, it must be very hard to discover that you're someone's bastard. But you're not mine.",
