        "Edmund: Cassie? Change of plan. Tammy is going to be fine. We spoke and she told me she thinks the kiss is a mistake. She just wants to move on. But, most importantly, she thanked me for not telling you. So, whatever you do, don't let on you know; or we're back to square one.",
        "Cassie: Page after page of Tammy assuming every time Edmund showed her any kindness; it meant that he was falling for her. Reva, I was there for half of these moments, and they didn't happen at all the way Tammy remembered. Now, look, I would like to believe that Tammy is letting her imagination run wild. She is misinterpreting things in this big of a way. This is serious and I don't know what to do about it.",
        "Josh: Cassie, have you... have you considered the possibility that this is not a case of Tammy's imagination running wild?",
        "Cassie: What do... what do you mean?",
        "Josh: Maybe this is not a fantasy thing. Maybe Edmund has been encouraging her in some way.",
        "Cassie: What was I thinking? What was I thinking coming here? You know, I should have known that you guys...",
        "Josh: No, no, no.",
        "Reva: It's hard for us to ignore everything we know about Edmund.",
        "Cassie: Edmund did not hit on my teenage daughter!",
        "Josh: I would like to hear that from him. Maybe I should just track him down and talk with him about it.",
        "Cassie: Josh, I told you that I was just there for half of these moments. Edmund was kind and he was sweet; nothing more, nothing less.",
        "Josh: Cassie, sometimes we see what we want to see.",
        "Reva: Okay, Josh, you're still on a low boil because of the whole Marah and Jeffrey thing, so I think we all need to calm down. And, Cassie, I don't think you were wrong to read Tammy's journal.",
        "Cassie: No? Then why do I feel so terrible?",
        "Reva: Well, you're going to have to get over that. You're also going to have to fess up and talk to her before this fantasy life of hers collides with reality.",
        "Cassie: Well, it's too late because there's already been a major collision. There's been a kiss, a real kiss. \u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671",
        "Harley: They're not going to bust you. They're going to help you. I promise. Listen, just call that number that I gave you first thing in the morning. Promise me you'll do that? Try to get some sleep, okay? No problem. Bye. Hey, is that the Egan's catalog?",
        "Eden: Yes. I can't believe you think I should register for gifts.",
        "Harley: Well, if you don't, you're going to get, like, 500 wine glasses and 20 can openers, so there you go.",
        "Eden: Can we get out of here? I'm really hungry, and I'll buy.",
        "Harley: Actually, can we order in? Marina's supposed to cover the phones, but, because she's late, I have to stay.",
        "Eden: Okay. Well, why don't you let me help you now on the phones and...",
        "Harley: No. No, no, no, no. She's coming. She's just going to be late.",
        "Eden: Okay. So, why don't I just fill in the meantime and... Do you have a problem with that? \u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671",
        "Jeffrey: Don't... don't look at me like that. I had to let you go. I had no choice. There was some stuff happening here that's going to get dangerous and the sooner you got out of Springfield, the better. (Sighs) Besides, you needed to make a fresh start, right? Don't, please. You think I'm making excuses. You think this is easy for me? I can't go back to the life I knew before I met you. You've changed me and I love you. But, I hate you for making me feel these feelings again; for making me feel these feelings that I never, ever wanted to feel again, because they're dangerous. They hurt. I needed to heal, so that's why you had to leave. \u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671",
        "Olivia: Spaulding preferred stock lost another dime today. How many shares did you pick up? So that gives us, what, 25%? Well, yeah, it's good, but it's not great. You should have bought more. So, somebody else is buying? So what? Look, I don't care what you have to do, get me more shares. Look, Phillip is not going to be in this hospital forever, okay? And it's going to be harder for me to gain controlling interest at Spaulding once he's out. So get to work!",
        "Rick: Fancy meeting you here.",
        "Olivia: I wasn't expecting to see you here tonight.",
        "Rick: Uh, Olivia, Phillip's doing very, very well at the moment. He's calm and he's very clear- headed, and I think if we just all pitch in, he should be home any day now. So, don't upset him. Do you hear me?",
        "Olivia: Yes, I hear you. I want what's best for Phillip as much as you do, Rick.",
        "Rick: I hope so. Well, I'm going to go meet my wife for a cocktail, but I'll be checking back later.",
        "Olivia: You do that. Don't worry, Rick. I really do know what's best for Phillip. Hi, honey.",
        "Phillip: Well, if it isn't Mrs. Spaulding.",
        "Olivia: Well, look at you. You look terrific. You look calm and rested.",
        "Phillip: I'm all of that and more.",
        "Olivia: I ran into Rick on the way in.",
        "Phillip: Oh, good. Well, then I guess he told you the good news, that I'm going to be getting out of this place very soon. \u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671",
        "Reva: A kiss. Edmund...",
        "Cassie: No, not Edmund. Tammy. Tammy kissed him.",
        "Reva: Okay, you said it was a \"real\" kiss. How real is real?",
        "Cassie: Too real. There's no question about it, Tammy meant it. I didn't want to believe this either, but I read about this in her journal.",
        "Josh: So, you're telling us that Edmund didn't respond.",
        "Cassie: No, he did not respond, Josh.",
        "Reva: Tammy must have been so embarrassed.",
        "Cassie: No, just the opposite. Her entry in her journal, it was gushy, and scary. And then Edmund tried to talk to her about it this morning, but then she was humiliated and she just literally ran away.",
        "Reva: Well, where is she now?",
        "Cassie: She's with Joey.",
        "Reva: You know what? Maybe he can get her to calm down.",
        "Cassie: God, I hope so, because I don't know what to do.",
        "Josh: You know what? In a way, this really shouldn't come as too much of a surprise.",
        "Cassie: Really? I'm floored.",
        "Josh: Yeah, I'm just saying: Think about it. What did Edmund do? He stepped in and became a father figure for Tammy, right?",
        "Cassie: Yes, and he's very good at it.",
        "Josh: I'm not saying that he isn't.",
        "Reva: You know, and Tammy did grow up without a father.",
        "Cassie: That's true, because Rob wasn't a father worth having, that's for sure.",
        "Reva: And, you know, Richard filled that void for a little while, and then he was gone.",
        "Cassie: I was so caught up in the gap that I had in my life that I wasn't even there for my daughter.",
        "Reva: Cassie, no one can be both a mother and father to a child.",
        "Cassie: Josh did.",
        "Josh: No. I did the best I could when they were younger, but I was lucky. Reva stepped in by the time we got to the terrible teens.",
        "Reva: And even with two parents, it's a tough thing for any family.",
        "Josh: Yes, it is.",
        "Reva: You know? I mean, we had a tough time with Marah, and she's a grown woman.",
        "Josh: Yeah, don't remind me. (Cell phone ringing) I'm going to get that and I'll be back in a minute.",
        "Cassie: I thought that Edmund could help Tammy, you know? He's just so nurturing and he's so there.",
        "Reva: Okay, you said that he did and said all the right things for Tammy, right?",
        "Cassie: Yes, yes.",
        "Reva: Okay. What happened the last time Edmund allowed himself to be so charming? You fell in love with him. So, how can an impressionable, fatherless young girl resist that kind of charisma, cassia?

        "Harley: It's not quite that simple.",
        "Eden: Well, I will catch on. Just give me a try?",
        "Harley: Eden, you know, you have your own style, and that's great. It may not be the tone that we need to establish on these hot line calls.",
        "Eden: Well, when a call comes in, I say, \"hello,\" and I listen patiently to whatever their problem may be, and then refer them to a counselor, rehab center or an adoption agency; whatever their needs are. The numbers are conveniently listed right next to the phone. Is that the right tone?",
        "Harley: Eden... (Telephone rings)",
        "Eden: Here we go! Hello? Fifth Street hot line, how are you doing? Excuse me, um, what is your name? Mark. Hi, Mark. So, your girlfriend what? Wait.... wait. She left you why? How many times? Are you're wondering why she left you? Oh, you have got to be kidding me. Oh, if you were cheating me on like that, I would have tossed you out. You are a loser. Oh, yeah. You heard me. You are a pathetic loser... Mark? Hold on a second?",

        "Rick: \"Beautiful, just like her mother.\" It seems to be the standard line these days.",

        "Phillip: Calm, cool and collected.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, exactly. So, I was thinking that one of the things we can do is to get all the stressors out of your life.",

        "Olivia: (Sighs) look, I hate to be the one to have to tell you this, but since Alan won't, Spaulding is being investigated.",
        "Phillip: Investigated? By whom?",
        "Olivia: Investigated by the federal government. They have dozens of agents just going through files, records and e-mails, basically anything they can get their hands on.

        "Cassie: I have no idea how I'm going to talk to her about this. I can't. I just can't do this.",
        "Reva: Well, you're going to have to.",
        "Cassie: All right. Well, it's bad enough with the situation with Edmund, but now we have the issue that I read her journal without her permission. She is going to be hysterical.",
        "Reva: Well, you're going to have to find a way to discuss it.",
        "Cassie: I don't know. Reva, when I was her age, my life was completely different, except for one thing. Everything really, really mattered, and I would have freaked if someone did this to me.",
        "Reva: Well, Tammy's going to freak, too, but you're going to have to deal with it.",
        "Cassie: Why couldn't I have had boys, all boys?",
        "Reva: Well, you know what they say? You want your heartbroken, have a daughter.",
        "Cassie: Who said that?",
        "Reva: I don't know, somebody.",
        "Cassie: Well, I know you've had your moments with Marah.",
        "Reva: You know something? That is the understatement of the decade. I'll tell you, when I found out that it was Marah that shot Carrie, I thought, \"Well, here we go.

        "Marina: What would I do without you?",
        "Shayne: You're never going to have to find out. Good-bye. See you guys later.",
        "Harley: Bye.",
        "Eden: You know, it's funny; I was just raging against how lousy men are and look at the three of us. I have Bill, who's the most wonderful man. And you have my brother, who's pretty terrific. And you have Shayne.",
        "Marina: Shayne's the best.",
        "Harley: And we all deserve these guys.",
        "Eden: All of us?",
        "Harley: Yes, even you.",
        "Eden: Even me?",
        "Harley: I have to say I am surprised. I still can't believe I found a guy as great as Gus, somebody who I can love and trust.",
        "Marina: Someone who puts you first.",
        "Harley: Yeah. Imagine that.",
        "Eden: Well, now that we have established how happy we all are, I am going to take off and leave the phones to the pros. (Laughter)",
        "Marina: You know, Eden, I think you should come back and try the hot line thing again. I really think that you could be an inspiration to people who are stuck in a hole and think they can't get out of it.",
        "Harley: You know, actually, she does kind of have a point.",
        "Eden: You mean, if I can get out of it, anyone can?",
        "Marina: I'm sorry, I didn't mean it that way.",
        "Eden: No, no, no. You're right. Maybe I will, even though it might ruin my bad girl image for good. Bad girl, she gets married, does volunteer work.",
        "Harley: Alexandra would love that.",
        "Eden: Huh. You know what? I will be in right after the wedding. (Laughter) Now, I am going to go pick out my gifts and I will see you girls soon.

        "Marina: Yeah, no, I'm sorry. I've just been a little bit lost. But I'm not going to fall down on the job, I promise. I...",
        "Harley: Hey, hey, hey. Don't stress out about it. I mean, after the year you've had, it's very understandable if you need some down time.",

        "Phillip: Well, she's not lying about Spaulding.",
        "Alan: No. But she's distorting the truth and manipulating you to prop up her position at the company.",
        "Phillip: Her position?",
        "Alan: Yes. I mean, Phillip, as long as she can keep you here laid up, out of commission, the longer she has your vote on the board. I mean, at the last board meeting, she showed up with your signed proxy.",
        "Phillip: What?",
        "Alan: Phillip, she waltzed in and said this was your request. You are aware of that, aren't you? I mean, it was a legitimate document. I would recognize your signature anywhere.",

        "Alan: You didn't read it?",
        "Phillip: No. Read what? I was drugged half out of my mind. It felt like my brain was filled with cotton. All I remember is her sticking some papers in my lap and a pen in my hand.",
        "Alan: Olivia made you sign it, huh?",
        "Phillip: Yeah. She said \"sign it, it's nothing important.\" She didn't say anything about a proxy or the board.

        "Marina: Yeah. You know, I really want to make him happy. I just don't know how.",
        "Harley: Okay, well, that's your first mistake. You can't worry about making him happy. You have to be happy first. And then, eventually, Frank will catch up.",
        "Marina: I don't know how to do that. I guess I have a lot to figure out.",
        "Harley: That's perfectly okay, because at your age, you're not supposed to have anything figured out yet. (Laughs)",

        "Harley: Yeah. Everything is really good right now. It kind of scares me sometimes. But I'm lucky, you know? There was a time when I didn't think that I would ever find somebody like this. We're very lucky that we found each other.",

We're just going to have to be honest with her. If she pulls back and she freaks out, then we have to deal with that together. You're not an outsider looking in on this family anymore.
