        "Josh: Look, I know you're not a fan of jonathan's, and quite frankly, neither am I.",
        "Bill: He's a menace to society.",
        "Josh: But perhaps he has untapped potential.",
        "Bill: Potential to destroy our company.",
        "Josh: No, you're giving him way too much credit here, bill. Now, don't worry, okay? I'll make sure he's under constant surveillance.",
        "Bill: If you say so. But why don't you tell me the real story? What's jonathan got on you?",
        "Reva: What have you got on josh?",
        "Jonathan: Nothing. He thinks I'm a one-man wrecking crew, so maybe he has something for me in demolition.",
        "Reva: Or you blackmailed him into giving you the job.",
        "Jonathan: Fine. You want the truth? You got it.",
        "Josh: Okay, the truth is, i did it for reva.",
        "Bill: Well, I thought you wanted him to be far away as possible from her.",

        "Bill: Did you tell my dad about this?",
        "Josh: No. So I had to make an executive decision. What do you think about it?",
        "Bill: I think it's a great idea that you're hiring him.",
        "Reva: This was josh's idea?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. He offered me the job, no strings attached. At first I turned him down, of course.",
        "Reva: Well, of course. Why take a nine-to-five when hustling pool at farley's is a full-time job?",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) I like the way you think. But josh came to me a second time and insisted that I take the job, so he made me an offer that I couldn't refuse.",
        "Josh: Look, I don't want to come off like some mafia don pulling your strings in the shadows, all right? You are the man that runs lewis construction.",
        "Bill: Yeah, I know. So when does jonathan start?",
        "Josh: About 15 minutes ago.",
        "Jonathan: Josh isn't big on the whole punctuality thing, is he?",

        "Cassie: He is the father of the baby.",
        "Jeffrey: Unlucky kid.",
        "Cassie: Do you have to be the most insensitive person I know?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, I probably am, but that's what you like about me, right?",
        "Cassie: You're impossible.",
        "Jeffrey: And arrogant and self-serving. I've heard it all before.",
        "Cassie: Yes, you are. But you make me laugh and I need that right now.",
        "Jeffrey: I know. And I know that it's been very rough for you lately and I'm sorry about that. But I'm not sorry that edmund's moving out and I sure as hell am not sorry that you're going to be alone for a while.",
        "Dinah: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We have a deal. You don't leave now.",
        "Edmund: The deal is and always has been, dinah, that while you're carrying this child, cassie and I are its legal and biological parents, which means we call the shots. It's what cassie wants.",
        "Dinah: Edmund, why are we not talking about what I want?",
        "Edmund: I would hope you'd want the child to develop in a peaceful environment.",
        "Dinah: Well, how am I going to do that with you thousands of miles away? Edmund, hey, I feel safe with you. And I don't want you to go. But if you have to go, I'm going with you.",
        "Detective: Mr. Santos? I need you to explain to me what happened.",
        "Michelle: It was an accident. Mr. Santos was protecting me, and tony slipped and fell off the cliff. Detective, he needs to get himself to a hospital.",
        "Danny: ( Shivering ) no, I'll be okay. I'm okay.",
        "Michelle: Danny, you're shivering.",
        "Detective: You need to check this guy out.",
        "Michelle: You're probably hypothermic.",
        "Danny: I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm all right. I'm not going to the hospital. I'm not going to the...",
        "Paramedic: Let's get you into the ambulance, huh?",
        "Danny: I'm not going to the hospital.",
        "Michelle: Danny. Danny, listen to me. You have to get medical attention, okay? I'm not going to lose you, too, okay? This is all my fault. This is all my fault. ( Crying )",
        "Danny: It's not your fault.",
        "Michelle: It's all my fault.",
        "Danny: It's not your fault. No, it's not your fault.",
        "Marina: Oh, my god. Danny. No!",
        "Paramedic: Miss. Ma'am, please.",
        "Marina: No! Leave me alone.",
        "Marina: Danny.",
        "Danny: ( Shivering ) marina.",
        "Marina: Oh, my god. On the police report, they said there was an accident at laurel falls, and they said something about \"santos,\" and I thought...",
        "Danny: It was tony.",
        "Marina: Oh, my god.",
        "Danny: ( Shivering )",
        "Marina: Are you okay?",
        "Danny: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I'm fine.",
        "Marina: Oh, michelle. I'm so sorry.",
        "Michelle: So am I.",
        "Danny: Stop blaming yourself. Okay?",
        "Marina: How did... how did he...?",
        "Danny: We started fighting. He got angry, and we... we just were fighting and he fell.",
        "Michelle: I tried so hard to pull him up. I couldn't pull him up. Tony.",
        "Danny: And he fell. He fell.",
        "Marina: Danny!",
        "Michelle: We need help here now!",
        "Marina: Danny, can you hear me?",
        "Michelle: Danny...",
        "Marina: He's unconscious.",
        "Michelle: Danny. Danny, open your eyes. Come on, open your eyes.",
        "Reva: I'm very proud of you. I am. I just am so proud of you. My little baby boy's all grown up.",
        "Jonathan: Well, it's a step up from boosting cds, I guess.",
        "Reva: No, no, it's more than that. I know you don't need the money. I mean, I know you have your trust fund. So I'd like to think of this as you taking a step in the right direction, and I would like to think that I might have had something to do with that.",
        "Jonathan: You must be kind of happy, though, that this mother- son bonding thing is over.",
        "Reva: Over?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. I mean, now that I'm on my own, you and josh can start living the good life. Move to aspen...",
        "Reva: Sounds like you're trying to get rid of me.",
        "Jonathan: No. I mean, you did the mom thing and I really appreciate that, but josh would love to see me in his rearview mirror, and you deserve a break. I'm okay. I don't need you. For a good reason. You understand?",
        "Reva: Yeah. Sure.",
        "Jonathan: All right. Come on. I got a clock to punch.",
        "Edmund: Dinah, in a perfect world, I wouldn't miss a day of this pregnancy, but it's not a perfect world. I can't have everything i want...",
        "Dinah: Exactly. Exactly. That's what this is about.",
        "Edmund: And it's taken me a long time to accept that.",
        "Dinah: You know something? You and I started this together. Your baby is right here. We can go to san cristobel, but you are not going to miss a single day of this baby's life.",
        "Edmund: Yes, I am. Because cassie wants me to leave.",
        "Dinah: What are you talking about? No. No. We will go, but we're going to go together. What is going on? Is this a plot? What is it? You can tell me.",
        "Edmund: Dinah, the only thing I'm going to tell you is that cassie is bringing the boys here, we are going to tell them together, and then I am going to san cristobel alone.",
        "Dinah: Alone?",
        "Edmund: Alone.",
        "Dinah: Alone?",
        "Edmund: Alone.",
        "Dinah: What, and that's that?",
        "Edmund: That's that. And then cassie is going to realize how much she needs me and she's going to ask me to come back.",
        "Jeffrey: What are you doing?",
        "Cassie: Now?",
        "Jeffrey: Where are you going?",
        "Cassie: Why?",
        "Jeffrey: I was just wondering, you know, if... if you were busy.",
        "Cassie: I have to pick up the boys and take them home to see edmund to say good-bye.",
        "Jeffrey: And then?",
        "Cassie: And then what?",
        "Jeffrey: Edmund's gone. And then?",
        "Cassie: And then... Coming up on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Reva: I love you and I love our life. It's just, I need to start over, joshua.",
        "Cassie: This isn't fair to you.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you know what? Cassie, I've been running away from complicated my whole life, and our situation seems very simple to me.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, I hear you're good at multitasking.",
        "Cassie: This isn't fair to you. Everything is so complicated.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you know what? Cassie, I've been running away from \"complicated\" my whole life and our situation seems very simple to me.",
        "Cassie: I've got to go.",
        "Josh: This is great. His first day on the job; he's over an hour late.",
        "Bill: Well, maybe he got a better offer.",
        "Josh: Maybe he got himself arrested.",
        "Bill: No such luck.",
        "Jonathan: Jonathan randall reporting for duty.",
        "Josh: You're late.",
        "Reva: It's my fault.",
        "Bill: Hey. ( Laughter )",
        "Josh: I wasn't expecting you to come home tonight.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, he picked me up at the airport.",
        "Josh: Welcome home.",
        "Reva: Thanks. Thank you.",
        "Josh: Next time you're going to be late, you call.",
        "Jonathan: Yes, sir.",
        "Josh: Okay. Now, we have some catching up to do, don't we?",
        "Reva: Now?",
        "Josh: Yeah, yeah. Bill will run jonathan through the paces. He's the boss, right?",
        "Bill: Yeah, hey. Why don't we step outside and I'll go over the job description?",
        "Jonathan: Sure. Let's do it.",
        "Josh: What's wrong?",
        "Reva: Nothing.",
        "Josh: I thought you'd be happy that I was bringing jonathan into the family business.",
        "Reva: I am!",
        "Josh: Okay. ( Laughs ) then what's the problem? And don't tell me it's jet lag.",
        "Reva: You know me, I'm just out of sorts lately.",
        "Josh: Oh. Reva shayne lewis out of sorts. I'd better run$and hide.",
        "Reva: You know, why is it that everyone wants to run away from me right now?",
        "Josh: I don'T. In fact, I'm looking forward to having more of you.",
        "Reva: I'm sorry I've been so weird. ( Laughs )",
        "Josh: I prefer to think of it as challenging.",
        "Jonathan: Got to tell you, uncle bill, I'm a little surprised you'd give me a job at lewis construction.",
        "Bill: Well, I'm doing josh a favor. No need to put another marriage on the rocks.",
        "Jonathan: So josh only gave me the job because of reva?",
        "Bill: And I'm keeping you around because of olivia.",
        "Josh: So how were your last few days in aspen?",
        "Reva: Beautiful scenery, beautiful people. Lonely.",
        "Josh: Yeah, I'm sorry i wasn't there.",
        "Reva: No, it's not that.",
        "Josh: Thank you.",
        "Reva: You know what I mean.",
        "Josh: No, actually, I don't know what you mean, and that's part of the problem. I just thought that you'd be happy that jonathan now has a chance to stand on his own two feet.",
        "Reva: I am. And I'm even happier that you were able to get by the past and give him a chance.",
        "Josh: Well, he's your son, reva. It means a lot to you to have him be a part of your life, part of our lives. And I know with jonathan it's never going to be easy, but...",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, like mother, like son.",
        "Josh: I just figured if i could get him more connected to the family, you know?",
        "Reva: And once he's connected, then I'll go away again. Maybe that's the way it's supposed to be.",
        "Josh: Look, if you're not happy about aspen, we can just forget about it, okay? It was just supposed to be a vacation getaway. Springfield will always be our home.",
        "Reva: Home's different now. I love you and I love our life. It's just...",
        "Josh: Different.",
        "Reva: The kids are adults now and they're living lives of their own.",
        "Josh: That means we can have more time together.",
        "Reva: I need to start over, joshua. I don't know whether that should be in aspen, but I know I need a new beginning.",
        "Josh: What does that mean?",
        "Reva: Why does it have to mean anything? Isn't it obvious?",
        "Josh: Not to me. No. I'm sorry, I...",
        "Reva: What are you sorry for?",
        "Josh: I don't know. I'm just... I'm trying here, okay, reva? You're pushing me away and i don't have a clue as to why.",
        "Reva: You know what? Maybe you're just sorry that i came back too soon.",
        "Josh: Where are you going?",
        "Reva: Like you said, I don't have a clue. ( Laughs )",
        "Doctor: What have we got?",

        "Paramedic: Body temp 94. Pulse 126. Borderline shock.",

        "Michelle: Go ahead. You stay.",
        "Marina: Are you sure?",
        "Michelle: Yeah. Can I get just a minute please? Would that be okay? Oh, tony. I never meant to hurt you. I owe you my life, you know that? I couldn't save yours. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.",
        "Doctor: His core temperature is low. He's got some contusions, bruised ribs.",
        "Marina: Well, how serious is it?",
        "Doctor: We'll know more after we take some x-rays.",
        "Marina: Can I stay with him? Hey. Me and my great ideas, huh? Leaving you at laurel falls. Danny? Hey, danny, it's okay. It's okay, you're at cedars.",
        "Danny: Michelle.",
        "Marina: Hang on, I'll go get her for you.",
        "Danny: Michelle, where's marina? I want to talk to marina.",
        "Rey: Danny! Danny, it's ray.",
        "Danny: Ray.",
        "Ray: No, no, no. Don't try to talk. You're okay. That's all that matters. I got a call to give last rites. They warned me it was a family member, but you're okay. Whew. Man, am I glad you don't need my services.",
        "Danny: Ray. Ray.",
        "Ray: What is it? Are you in pain?",

        "R.J.: Are these yours?",
        "Edmund: Yes, they are. Yes, they're mine. I'M... I'm going away on a little trip. You went away on a trip, and now it's my turn. And the only bad part about it is I won't have much time to spend with you because I'm leaving tonight. Come here. Come here. I want to talk to you guys. You come right there. You sit there and you-- whoo-- you sit right there and I sit next to you. I'm going away on a very important mission. But you have a very important mission, too, right here. Right here, because I'm leaving you two in charge.",
        "R.J.: We're too little.",
        "Edmund: No, you're not. You're not too little. I think you're completely up to the task. And the biggest part about the task is you make sure you watch after those two, because they're going to try to paint the outside of the house pink. They're going to try to take you shopping every week, and they're going to try to-- worst thing of all-- have slumber parties. And we can't have that, can we?",
        "Will: No.",
        "R.J.: No way.",
        "Edmund: Absolutely not, right? No slumber parties. So you have to be right on top of your toes. Are we clear about that?",
