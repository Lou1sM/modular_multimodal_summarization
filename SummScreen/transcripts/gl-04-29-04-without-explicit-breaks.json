        "Josh: You're going to guess anytime soon? Or \r\nshould I... ",
        "Reva: Would you relax? I never had to guess \r\nbefore. ",
        "Josh: Okay. I'm sorry. ",
        "Reva: It's always just been there. Three of \r\nclubs. Six of spades. ",
        "Josh: Sorry. I think that's about 60 wrong. \r\nAnd zero right. ",
        "\r\nReva: But you know that it\u2019s. It's gone. After my encounter with Maryanne \r\nCaruthers, it's just that or maybe I just don't want to have another psychic \r\nepisode.\u00a0 Whatever it is I just never thought that the sight would just \r\ndisappear. But I can accept it. Or at least try to... ",
        "Josh: You want to call it quits? ",
        "Reva: Well, you try it now. You guess what \r\nI'm thinking. ",
        "Josh: Whipped cream. I'll get the whipped \r\ncream... out of the kitchen. ",

        "Gus: What have you got? ",
        "Dealer: Well... ",
        "Gus: So, you expect me to be happy and you \r\ncan trust me now, right? Now you're ready to do a little business. ",
        "Dealer: Yeah, I'm all about business. What's \r\nyour problem? ",
        "\r\nGus: My problem is, man, that you bring baby sized bag of weed when I asked you \r\nfor volume. Now you wish you brought your muscle with you? ",
        "Dealer: That's a taster, all right. Don't get \r\nin a panic. ",
        "\r\nGus: I need weight. Weight. I can't be dealing with a 60- count bag of script \r\nthat I can get... I can get that off a frat boy at C.U. ",
        "Dealer: That'll happen. ",
        "\r\nGus: I'll tell you something, man, if you are playing me, you are the one that's \r\ngoing to end of up in a panic, got it? ",
        "\r\nHarley: Hey, Gus, it's me. Again. Remember breakfast, eating and bill? Yeah, \r\nright. So we're at the office. Give us a call please. Bye. I'm really sorry you \r\nguys. You know what? Let's forget about him. Let's just go do it ourselves.\r\n",

        "Bill: Well, obviously the guy is busy. So, \r\nwhy don't we just bag it and reschedule, okay? We can do that. ",
        "Harley: No. No, Bill. Come on, we've already \r\nbagged dinner once before. Let's just do this. Forget about him. ",
        "Eden: I mean, I guess three is better than \r\nnone. ",
        "Bill: Oh, you know what? I'm gong to take a \r\nrain check, okay? ",
        "Eden: Bill... ",
        "\r\nBill: No, seriously. Sitting around with the ladies talking about wedding \r\ndresses, you know... besides I've got to go talk to Josh, so. ",
        "Eden: You all right? ",
        "Bill: Yeah, you know, I'm okay. All right. \r\nHave fun. ",
        "Harley: Sorry. ",

        "Michelle: Yep, we certainly do. ",

        "Danny: Looks like I did. ",
        "Jeffrey: How much does she know? ",
        "Michelle: You know she's in the room in case \r\nyou haven't noticed. ",
        "Danny: Michelle knows everything. ",
        "Jeffrey: Tell me I didn't hear that. Tell me \r\nI didn't hear something completely insane. ",
        "Michelle: I know everything. ",
        "Jeffrey: Congratulations, Santos. You just \r\nsigned a death warrant for your entire family. ",
        "Danny: I know exactly what I did, O\u2019Neill. I \r\nsaved my marriage by telling Michelle everything she needs to know. ",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, yeah? ",
        "Danny: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Michelle: Wherever Danny goes, I go. \n",
        "\r\nJeffrey: Oh, that's nice. So the family that goes under cover together stays \r\ntogether. If that wasn't so asinine, it might be quaint. I can't believe I even \r\nconsidered hiring you, Santos. If you operate like this in the field, you'll be \r\ndead in a week. ",
        "\r\nMichelle: You didn't hire Danny. You conned him from the very beginning and you \r\ngave him no way out until he agreed. ",
        "\r\nJeffrey: Well, that's the way it works, okay. Because guess what, Michelle? Your \r\nhusband here is a criminal. I'm giving him a chance to pay for his crimes. \r\nShould we could just throw him in prison. Is that what you want? I could throw \r\nhim in prison. No, I don't think you want that do you? ",
        "Danny: I told you it was going to have to be \r\nthis way. ",
        "\r\nJeffrey: That's right, you did tell me. I did give you and your husband a \r\nchoice. Either he could lie to you and protect you, or he could do what he's \r\ndoing now. ",
        "Michelle: And he chose the high road. \n",
        "\r\nJeffrey: The high road. Yeah. The road to most exposure you mean. This could \r\nhave worked. You could have gone away with the kid. ",
        "Michelle: And that wouldn't have been a red \r\nflag to the mob? Danny's wife and kid suddenly skipped town. ",
        "\r\nJeffrey: What's the matter with you? Hmm? What's the matter with you? You know, \r\nthis is what got you arrested and caught on the first place because you think \r\nyou got all the angles covered all the time. But guess what? You don't, do you, \r\nsmart guy? ",
        "Michelle: Look, I don't like the way you're \r\ntalking to us. If you want our cooperation... ",
        "\r\nJeffrey: Oh, you're going to cooperate, Michelle. You're going to cooperate \r\nbecause I tell you you're going to cooperate. ",
        "\r\nDanny: Hey, O\u2019Neill, you brought me in, so you can get what you get. I almost \r\nlost Michelle the last time, because I wasn't honest with her. ",
        "\r\nJeffrey: Oh, because you weren't honest with her. Give me a break, Danny. You \r\nonly tell the truth when you feel like it not when it's convenient for you. \r\nDon't ask me to be understanding about how almost lost your wife, because you're \r\na liar. ",
        "Michelle: That's not why we almost lost each \r\nother. ",
        "\r\nJeffrey: It doesn't matter, Michelle! What's going to cost you your marriage now \r\nis a bullet from Vinnie Salerno's gun! ",

        "Josh: Well, actually... ",
        "Reva: Well, private time, we can have another \r\ntime. ",
        "Josh: We can? ",
        "Reva: Have a heart, sweetheart. I am so sorry \r\nabout the whole election mess. ",
        "Bill: Thank you. ",
        "Reva: You must be an emotional wreck? \n",
        "\r\nBill: Pretty much. \u00a0In fact there's so much going on right now, I feel like my \r\nlife is moving along like a freight train. You know, either jump on board or \r\nwatch me pass you by. ",
        "Reva: My goodness. Are you ready to jump on?\r\n",
        "Josh: Depends on where you're going? \n",
        "\r\nBill: Well, the first stop is at the altar. Now, I know you weren't there when I \r\nmade the official announcement, but Eden and I are getting married. ",
        "Josh: Actually we know that. Your dad made \r\nthe announcement for us. ",
        "Reva: Congratulations, Bill. ",
        "Bill: Well, of course. ",
        "Josh: Congratulations. ",
        "Bill: Thank you. Now I know she doesn't fit \r\nthe Lewis bridal profile, but... ",
        "Reva: Bridal profile? ",
        "Josh: The what? (Laughter) ",
        "Bill: Well, yeah. I can't help how I feel. \r\nThat\u2019s... that\u2019s... ",
        "Reva: Why should you? I mean love, marry? \r\nMarry for love. What's that saying? We did, right? ",
        "Josh: Three times. ",
        "Bill: Yeah, of course. ",
        "Josh: If you're happy, we're happy. \n",
        "Reva: I'm happy. ",
        "Josh: I'm happy. So, are you happy? \n",
        "Bill: Well, for the most part, yes, I am.\r\n",
        "Josh: Well, good. ",
        "\r\nBill: But there's one that's been troubling me. I think there's only one thing \r\nto do. I need to resign from Lewis construction. ",
        "Josh: What are you talking about? ",
        "\r\nBill: Josh, I think it's the best thing for the company. I mean with the \r\nelection scandal, people are talking about Danny and me... ",
        "Reva: Well, you know, it's not easy dealing \r\nwith rumors, but... ",
        "Bill: No, especially when they're true.\r\n",
        "Reva: Danny did rig the election. ",
        "\r\nBill: I didn't believe it myself. In fact it made me sick to my stomach. He told \r\nme himself that... I mean I should have seen it coming. Being the campaign \r\nmanager, I'm supposed to see these things. I should have caught it. But... I \r\ndon't know. ",
        "Reva: Well, you know not if he was trying to \r\nhide things from you. ",
        "\r\nBill: Yeah, but you know, Aunt Reva, I should have known better. This guy is a \r\nmobster. He is, was, always will be. He's used to getting what he wants. In \r\nfact, he looked me right in the eye and said he was prepared to do whatever he \r\nhad to do to win. ",
        "Josh: Bill, are you culpable for anything?\r\n",
        "\r\nBill: No. No, I mean I'm not vulnerable to any legal action or anything, but \r\nwhat I'm thinking about here is the company. And let's face it, Uncle Josh, if a \r\ncampaign manager of a crooked candidate is running Lewis construction it's not \r\nnecessarily good for business nor is it good public relations. We're going to \r\nlose customers. ",
        "Bob: We could take the hit. ",
        "\r\nBill: Now, look you trusted me to make the right decision for the company, and \r\nthis is a decision that I have to make. So please just accept my resignation \r\nfrom Lewis construction. ",

        "Harley: I'm standing up for you in this \r\nwedding. ",
        "Eden: You know, \u00a0I haven't always been your \r\nfavorite person. \u00a0",
        "Harley: You've never been my favorite person. \r\nWhat does that have to do with anything? ",
        "Eden: Traditionally, and maybe I'm wrong, the \r\nmaid of honor usually likes the bride. ",
        "\r\nHarley: Yeah, that's a point. But I want to do this for you. Gus wants me to do \r\nthis for you. Despite all that stuff you guys have been through, you love him \r\nand I love him. ",
        "Eden: Okay, so we both love him. So what?\r\n",
        "\r\nHarley: So it's the only thing that you and I have in common. From where I \r\nstand, it seems like as good place as any for us to start building a \r\nrelationship. From where I stand, you know, you asked me to be in your wedding \r\nparty and that was kind of A... you know, that was a turning point for us. I am \r\ngoing to give anything I can to this wedding.

        "Eden: For my sake or Nicky\u2019s? ",
        "\r\nHarley: For both of you. What does it matter? Hey, think about it. You know, we \r\ncould really develop sort of A... a friendship... a little. ",
        "Eden: Okay. You know, I always... I wanted to \r\nclear the air with you and not just for Nicky\u2019s sake. ",
        "Harley: If you and I could just get along, I \r\nthink he'd be very happy. ",
        "Eden: Well, I always thought that for a \r\nsquare you were really cool. ",
        "Harley: I'm square? ",
        "Eden: Not in a bad way. Thought I mean your \r\nmommy and you were a Spaulding and goody two shoe cops... ",
        "Harley: I'm a goody two shoes and a square.\r\n",
        "Eden: Well, compared to me. ",
        "Harley: Yeah, a madam and a murderer. \n",
        "Eden: Okay. Sorry. ",
        "Harley: This might be a little harder than we \r\nthought. ",
        "Eden: Why don't we just think about how happy \r\nNicky will be when we're getting along? ",
        "\r\nHarley: No. You know what? Why don't we think about how great your wedding day \r\nis going to be? Let's put the past behind us and let's focus on what matters, \r\nwhich is how beautiful you are going to look in your dress. ",
        "\r\nEden: Oh, Harley. Thank you. You are very, very sweet... I don\u2019t... I don't have \r\na lot of friends, because Marah's in Paris and Darci, well, she's never around.\r\n",
        "\r\nHarley: Yeah. Well, she's still kind of swinging from a star because of Frank. I \r\nguess until she comes back down to earth, you're stuck with me. ",

        "Eden: I'll see you later, Harley. ",
        "Marie: I'm so surprised at you having \r\ndealings with someone like her. I thought you had more integrity than that.\r\n",
        "Eden: You don't really want to have a \r\nconversation with me about integrity, do you, Marie? ",
        "Marie: I don't think I like what you're \r\nsuggesting. ",

        "Harley: And this time you care? ",

        "Harley: What makes you think she's in San \r\nCristobel? ",
        "Marie: Well, he goes there all the time, \r\nsupposedly on business. ",
        "Harley: Yeah. Doesn't Spaulding manufacture \r\ncertain drugs in San Cristobel? ",
        "Marie: I suppose. ",
        "Harley: So, then overseeing production might \r\nbe kind of a legitimate reason for Brad to be in San Cristobel? ",
        "\r\nMarie: I thought I was going to get the third degree, I don't think I would have \r\ncome over here. But Harley\u2019s angels are supposed to be the best agency in town.\r\n",
