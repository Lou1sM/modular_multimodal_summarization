Tell me I didn't hear something completely insane. \nMichelle: I know everything. \nJeffrey: Congratulations, Santos. You just signed a death warrant for your entire family. \nDanny: I know exactly what I did, O\u2019Neill. I saved my marriage by telling Michelle everything she needs to know. \nJeffrey: Oh, yeah? \nDanny: Mm-hmm. \nMichelle: Wherever Danny goes, I go. \n\nJeffrey: Oh, that's nice. So the family that goes under cover together stays together. If that wasn't so asinine, it might be quaint. I can't believe I even considered hiring you, Santos. If you operate like this in the field, you'll be dead in a week. \nMichelle: You didn't hire Danny. You conned him from the very beginning and you gave him no way out until he agreed. \nJeffrey: Well, that's the way it works, okay. Because guess what, Michelle? Your husband here is a criminal. I'm giving him a chance to pay for his crimes. Should we could just throw him in prison. Is that what you want? I could throw him in prison. No, I don't think you want that do you? \nDanny: I told you it was going to have to be this way. \nJeffrey: That's right, you did tell me. I did give you and your husband a choice. Either he could lie to you and protect you, or he could do what he's doing now. \nMichelle: And he chose the high road. \n\nJeffrey: The high road. Yeah. The road to most exposure you mean. This could have worked. You could have gone away with the kid. \nMichelle: And that wouldn't have been a red flag to the mob? Danny's wife and kid suddenly skipped town. \nJeffrey: What's the matter with you? Hmm? What's the matter with you? You know, this is what got you arrested and caught on the first place because you think you got all the angles covered all the time. But guess what? You don't, do you, smart guy? \nMichelle: Look, I don't like the way you're talking to us. If you want our cooperation... \nJeffrey: Oh, you're going to cooperate, Michelle. You're going to cooperate because I tell you you're going to cooperate. \nDanny: Hey, O\u2019Neill, you brought me in, so you can get what you get. I almost lost Michelle the last time, because I wasn't honest with her. \nJeffrey: Oh, because you weren't honest with her. Give me a break, Danny. You only tell the truth when you feel like it not when it's convenient for you. Don't ask me to be understanding about how almost lost your wife, because you're a liar. \nMichelle: That's not why we almost lost each other. \nJeffrey: It doesn't matter, Michelle!

Your dad made the announcement for us. \nReva: Congratulations, Bill. \nBill: Well, of course. \nJosh: Congratulations. \nBill: Thank you. Now I know she doesn't fit the Lewis bridal profile, but... \nReva: Bridal profile? \nJosh: The what? (Laughter) \nBill: Well, yeah. I can't help how I feel. That\u2019s... that\u2019s... \nReva: Why should you? I mean love, marry? Marry for love. What's that saying? We did, right? \nJosh: Three times. \nBill: Yeah, of course. \nJosh: If you're happy, we're happy. \n\nReva: I'm happy. \nJosh: I'm happy. So, are you happy? \n\nBill: Well, for the most part, yes, I am.\nJosh: Well, good. \nBill: But there's one that's been troubling me. I think there's only one thing to do. I need to resign from Lewis construction. \nJosh: What are you talking about? \nBill: Josh, I think it's the best thing for the company. I mean with the election scandal, people are talking about Danny and me... \nReva: Well, you know, it's not easy dealing with rumors, but... \nBill: No, especially when they're true.\nReva: Danny did rig the election. \nBill: I didn't believe it myself. In fact it made me sick to my stomach. He told me himself that... I mean I should have seen it coming. Being the campaign manager, I'm supposed to see these things. I should have caught it. But... I don't know. \nReva: Well, you know not if he was trying to hide things from you. \nBill: Yeah, but you know, Aunt Reva, I should have known better. This guy is a mobster. He is, was, always will be. He's used to getting what he wants. In fact, he looked me right in the eye and said he was prepared to do whatever he had to do to win. \nJosh: Bill, are you culpable for anything?\nBill: No. No, I mean I'm not vulnerable to any legal action or anything, but what I'm thinking about here is the company. And let's face it, Uncle Josh, if a campaign manager of a crooked candidate is running Lewis construction it's not necessarily good for business nor is it good public relations.

From where I stand, you know, you asked me to be in your wedding party and that was kind of A... you know, that was a turning point for us. I am going to give anything I can to this wedding. \nEden: For my sake or Nicky\u2019s? \nHarley: For both of you. What does it matter? Hey, think about it.

I wanted to clear the air with you and not just for Nicky\u2019s sake. \nHarley: If you and I could just get along, I think he'd be very happy. \nEden: Well, I always thought that for a square you were really cool. \nHarley: I'm square? \nEden: Not in a bad way.

Sorry. \nHarley: This might be a little harder than we thought. \nEden: Why don't we just think about how happy Nicky will be when we're getting along? \nHarley: No. You know what?

You're making things worse yourself. You know, they'll use your son if they have to. Are you getting the picture here? \nMichelle: Yes, I am. \nJeffrey: You know that these people will stop at nothing.

I've already explained to Michelle all the risks. \nMichelle: Look, I'm sorry about this woman Rebecca that you lost. I'm sure it was very traumatic for you. \nJeffrey: Oh, do you think I'm telling you this pretty little story because I want your sympathy? You come in here and you think you know everything, you think you've got all the answers, right? You think your love for Danny is so strong. Higher than the highest mountain, deeper than the deepest sea. \n\nMichelle: You know you don't have to humiliate me to make your point, okay? \nJeffrey: Yeah, well, you don't seem to be responding to the logic angle too well. So, I'm doing what I can here. \n\nMichelle: Then trust Danny and me to know how to handle ourselves. \nJeffrey: Trust you with all of your vast experience. \nDanny: We survived Carmen. \nJeffrey: Carmen was sloppy, Danny. You gave away most of the family business to Salerno and you know how dangerous that makes him right now. \nMichelle: He's going to want to hold on to it. \nJeffrey: Exactly! He's going to want to hold on to it. In spite of everything that snake has up his sleeve, I had Danny\u2019s road back into the mob all mapped out. But, now you're in the mix.
