        "Cassie: Hi. Come in.",
        "Jeffrey: Thanks. Well, I had a feeling you'd call. Place looks good. So edmund-free.",
        "Cassie: Something's happened.",
        "Jeffrey: What's wrong?",
        "Cassie: I need you more than I ever have.",
        "Edmund: I'm at the airport now.",
        "Pa announcer: Flight 1032 to san cristobel is now boarding at gate 17.",
        "Dinah: Cassie pushed your daddy away, little darling. We wouldn't want him to make this trip alone. So we're going to go ahead and meet him on the plane. It should be a nice surprise.",
        "Edmund: Right. 10:32. Have the driver meet me at the gate. Thank you.",
        "Pa announcer: Again, flight 1032 is now boarding at gate",
        "Ross: You'd better hurry, edmund. I'd hate for you to miss the flight.",
        "Buzz: Gus, it's buzz again. Look, where are you? I've been leaving messages for you all over town. You know, it's not my job to worry about you. I've got my own kids to worry about. But something tells me you're not mia on purpose. Look, harley wants to talk to you. So stop messing around. Call me, tell me you're safe.",
        "Gus: How bout you give me some water? And some pepto. My ulcer's killing me. I'm talking to you! They can lock you up, baby, and they can lock me up, but they can't keep us apart. I'll get out of here somehow.",
        "Mallet: Hey.",
        "Harley: Hey.",
        "Mallet: Any luck?",
        "Harley: Well, I have sniffed hundreds of perfume samples, and all I got is a headache and a roommate who's tired of hearing me sneeze.",
        "Mallet: So nothing like the perfume you remember from the night of phillip's murder?",
        "Harley: None of them. Or all of them. I don't know. I don't even know what jasmine smells like anymore.",
        "Mallet: Well, you were pretty sure about it when it came back to you outside my office. That's why I brought you the samples.",
        "Harley: I know. But now my nose is so over stimulated I can't tell what I'm smelling. And I'm even more confused about what I actually do remember from that night. Which is what you wanted. Oh, please. You don't want me to catch the real killer. You want me to stay here stuck here in this place with you. Well, don't you?",
        "Mallet: You tell me, harley. This portion of \"guiding light\" is sponsored by tide. Works wonders.",
        "Danny: We need to talk about funeral arrangements.",
        "Michelle: I mean, it was only a few days ago we were planning our wedding. Now we got to plan his funeral?",
        "Danny: Well, I think that ray would agree that tony wouldn't want something big with a lot of people...",
        "Michelle: No, no.",
        "Danny: ...Standing up and saying stuff about him.",
        "Michelle: Don'T. Definitely keep it simple.",
        "Danny: We'll figure it out, michelle. One thing at a time. Michelle...",
        "Michelle: You know what? Don't really. Because I know what you're going to say. No. How could we even look at each other knowing what tony did for us?",
        "Danny: For us?",
        "Frank: Hey. I heard you were at the hospital.",
        "Marina: Tony'S...",
        "Frank: I know. I heard. How are you holding up? Sweetie, this is just one of the reasons why I don't want you seeing danny. This is what his life's all about.",
        "Marina: Daddy, no lectures today. Please. I just can't take it.",
        "Frank: Okay, honey, no lectures. That's not why I'm here.",
        "Harley: I know what you're trying to do.",
        "Mallet: Oh, man. I know incarceration breathes paranoia, but yours kicked in real fast.",
        "Harley: I am not being paranoid. You keep saying you want to help me, but you're doing everything in your power to keep me from communicating with the one person who canctually help me.",
        "Mallet: Whoa, whoa. I brought you those perfume samples to help you, which is what I've been trying to do since the day you got here.",
        "Harley: I don't want your help! When are you going to get the message?",
        "Mallet: Oh, I got it. The only man worthy of coming to your rescue is gus aitoro. Let's see, the guy who bumbled your trial, put you in harms way again and again.",
        "Harley: It doesn't matter. It's still my choice.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I know it is. That's why I called him.",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Mallet: I called the guy. I left him a message, okay. Two, actually. No response. I guess your efforts to push him away really worked.",
        "Harley: Why should I believe a word you say? This is exactly what you want. Now you get to step in there and you get to be the big hero, don't you?",
        "Mallet: No, no, no. No, thanks. No, thanks. I actually prefer my women available.",
        "Harley: Just stay away from me.",
        "Mallet: Listen, what we had was what we had. But there's nothing between us now, and there won't be, okay. That's why I'm the perfect guy to help you out.",
        "Harley: And that's why I keep telling you for what I hope is the last time I don't want your help, okay? Thank you for the perfume samples. I'll pursue this on my own.",
        "Mallet: ( Sighs ) right. From your cell. With limited phone and restricted e-mail time? Right, okay. You do realize how ridiculous that sounds, don't you? No, of course you don'T. Because you're... you're... you're you. Oh, hey, buzz. Your daughter's right over there. Oh, and you'll be delighted to know that prison hasn't changed her a bit.",
        "Ross: Rumor has it, edmund, that you're leaving town. Is that right?",
        "Edmund: Are you here to give me an official send-off, mayor?",
        "Ross: I'm here to make sure that you get on that airplane. Because I know that what you say and what you do can be two completely different things.",
        "Edmund: You know, ross, you should stop meddling in other people's business. Especially your daughter'S. If you haven't noticed, she doesn't appreciate it.",
        "Ross: Well, dinah seldom knows what's best for her.",
        "Edmund: And you do?",
        "Ross: I do know that it's not you. So you wanted a baby so you could hold on to cassie. That means you needed somebody vulnerable and needy to be your pawn.",
        "Edmund: Dinah is not my pawn.",
        "Ross: Edmund, you took advantage of her feelings for you and used her in the worst possible way. And that's why I want you on that plane and out of my daughter's life.",
        "Jeffrey: What's wrong?",
        "Cassie: It's will.",
        "Jeffrey: Is he sick?",
        "Cassie: I just got this. It's from alonzo in san cristobel. He is will's biological father, and he wants me to send him down there so he could be schooled at the palace in royal tradition.",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie, this isn't just a request.",
        "Cassie: I know. That's a royal decree. That's why I called you.",
        "Jeffrey: And this just came out of the blue?",
        "Cassie: No. Part of my unofficial adoption agreement was that will would go down to san cristobel and at some point be schooled to be a prince. Now I thought this was going to happen when he was much older or when he was a teenager. And I thought by then I could talk to alonzo and figure something out.",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie, he's the heir to the throne.",
        "Cassie: He's a four-year-old little boy, jeffrey. And he needs to be with his mother. And I am not going to send him down there to a country he doesn't know, with a man he doesn't know, and he's going to be surrounded by nannies and guards. I'm not going to do it.",
        "Jeffrey: Calm down.",
        "Cassie: I'm scared. Now, please tell me what I can do.",
        "Jeffrey: Let me see. You know, you need to get in touch with someone in the state department and probably hire a lawyer who's very well-versed with international law. Cassie, I'm sorry. That's not me.",
        "Cassie: So what are you saying, you're just not going to help me?",
        "Jeffrey: No, I'll help you, okay. I'll help you. I'm just saying you that you need to retain an expert. So I'll look into it, okay. We'll get you a big gun on board. How's that?",
        "Cassie: Fine, okay. Thanks.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay.",
        "Cassie: No, really. Thank you. Thank you so much. I really don't know what I would do without you.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, I understand that. But you know what? There's something that you need to understand. You can't keep, you know, just letting me in and calling me when you need me to help you with something. Because I will, you know. I will always help you. Because that's what I do. But you know, there is something between us, something real and special. I'm doing my part and you're not doing yours. So either put yourself into it or let it go. That way we can both get on with our lives. I'll be in touch.",
        "Frank: Give me a second, honey, okay? Good, you got my message.",
        "Jeffrey: About the santos accident? Yeah.",
        "Marina: You guys want to question danny and michelle, don't you? Can't you guys just give them a couple of days? They just lost someone they loved in a terrible accident. They are grieving. Give them a couple of days.",
        "Frank: Honey, please. Listen, you need to just take a step back, okay. You need to stop worrying about danny so much, and start thinking about yourself.",
        "Marina: You know what? I'm already a step ahead of you, dad. Because I already talked to michelle and I told her that i think that she and danny need this time alone together. And I'm staying completely out of it, okay? My choice.",
        "Michelle: You know what? I'm going to be back soon. Just give him a kiss for me. Thanks. He's fine. He's sleeping.",
        "Danny: Michelle, do you think tony... I mean, what are you saying? You think he sacrificed himself for us?",
        "Michelle: ( Sighs ) I... I didn't mean it that way, okay. I just meant that tony made a choice. You know, he put our lives above his own and decided that we... I don't even know why I brought it up. I...",
        "Danny: He decided that we what?",
        "Michelle: ...Can't talk about it.",
        "Danny: Look, I don't understand. What went on with you and tony after I left vegas? Who called off the wedding? Was it you? Why?",
        "Michelle: Listen, I really don't think we should talk about this right now, okay?",
        "Danny: Why?",
        "Michelle: Because tony is dead. Okay, out of respect for tony.",
        "Danny: Well, michelle, we can't just avoid it. Can we?",
        "Michelle: I'm not saying avoid it forever. I'm just saying I don't think right now is the right time, okay?",
        "Danny: Did you call off the wedding because you want to be with me?",
        "Michelle: Danny, I just can'T... I'm sorry. I feel so guilty, I can'T...",
        "Danny: Just tell me, michelle. Is that why you called off the wedding, because of us?",
        "Jeffrey: Danny? I need to talk to you. Michelle, I think frank needs to speak to you as well.",
        "Buzz: Hey, you.",
        "Harley: Hi, daddy.",
        "Guard: Hey.",
        "Harley: No touching.",
        "Buzz: Forgot.",
        "Harley: It's okay. Everybody forgets.",
        "Buzz: Must be rough on gus.",
        "Harley: Well, we haven't actually had an official visit yet.",
        "Buzz: Alex said she visited you.",
        "Harley: She did. It was about alan. Lena?",
        "Lena: Yeah.",
        "Harley: This is my dad, buzz cooper.",
        "Buzz: Hi.",
        "Lena: How are you doing?",
        "Harley: This is lena, my cell mate.",
        "Buzz: Nice to meet you.",
        "Lena: Yes, it's nice to meet you. You have a great daughter.",
        "Buzz: Well, thanks.",
        "Harley: She's pretty great herself.",
        "Lena: No. No, no, no.",
        "Buzz: Um... so you have a visitor today?",
        "Lena: Well, we'll see. Anyway, you two, you have a great visit.",
        "Buzz: Okay.",
        "Lena: Come on, let me have the cell phone. Quick, come on...",
        "Guard: I don't think so.",
        "Lena: Come on.",
        "Guard: This ain't free.",
        "Lena: Spaulding, this is an update. Listen, this one is really going to cost you. I hate this. Harley, is just as... yeah, yeah, I know. You don't care. All right, fine. But I do. You know I thought this was going to be simple for me, you know. It's a role. I mean, like any other role. But, you know, I watch this kid. She has a family, and they love her and she loves them. ( Sighs ) yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay. Here it goes. She thinks she remembers something about the night that your son was murdered. Yeah, it's something to do with the smell of perfume. Jasmine, she thinks. All right, if you do appreciate this then you're going to send my daughter a bigger money order, you understand? Twice as much. Twice. I need her to come here. I... I need to see her. I need to see her here so she can thank me.",
        "Gus: Hello? It's getting very hot. Can I have some water, please?",
        "Disguised voice: You're doing okay, mr. Aitoro. Tell me that you'll drop the investigation and stop looking for the real killer and I will let you out into the cool night air.",
        "Gus: ( Laughs ) you can go to hell! You can go to hell.",
        "Harley: What did mallet say to you when you came in?",
        "Buzz: What did he say to you right before that?",
        "Harley: Nothing. Really. He's just his same-old obnoxious self. Nothing's changed.",
        "Buzz: That's sort of what he said about you. What's this?",
        "Harley: This is just a silly project that I'm working on. Tell me about my boys. Are they all grown-up?",
        "Buzz: Honey, it's been a couple of weeks.",
        "Harley: Feels like a year to me. Hey, don't forget to sign up zach for that soccer camp.",
        "Buzz: I did. I did. Um, have you hear from gus?",
        "Harley: Gus? No, not since I came in. Why?",
        "Buzz: Would you have expected to have heard from him by now?",
        "Harley: Why?",
        "Buzz: Oh, it's probably nothing.",
        "Harley: Daddy, what's going on?",
        "Buzz: It's probably nothing, honey.",
        "Harley: Oh, my gosh. Tell me.",
        "Buzz: He seems to have disappeared.",
        "Harley: Disappeared? You think something happened to him. You think someone got to him. Phillip's killer?",
        "Gus: Coming up on \"guiding light...\"",
        "Harley: He did not just disappear. Something has happened to him. I'm sure of it. Either phillip's killer got to him, or they are already after him. Either way I have to help him. I have to get out of here. oprah: Her husband became a woman.",
        "Cassie: Edmund.Rossatre yoi her",
        "Edmund: Ross and his friend, ralph, wanted to make sure i left town.",
        "Cassie: Ross, you and vanessa are way out of line. Now, we have a legal- binding contract with your daughter to carry our child, and you've got to stop harassing us.",
        "Ross: Cassie, you were the one who wanted edmund to leave.",
        "Cassie: I've changed my mind.",
        "Edmund: You have?",
        "Ross: Why? Look, that's between me and my husband. So if you don't mind.",
        "Ross: You know, you keep telling me that this is none of my business, but it is. Because not only do I love my daughter, I care about what happens to you. And so long as you're with this man, you're begging for trouble.",
        "Edmund: Cassie.",
        "Cassie: This isn'T... this isn't what you think. All right? This is about will.",
        "Edmund: Will? What happened to him? Where is he?",
        "Cassie: Alonzo sent me that, and he wants me to send him will.",
        "Edmund: He's getting pressure from the people around him.",
        "Cassie: Edmund, I am so afraid for my little boy. I talked to jeffrey, but I know that you can help me. I know that you'll know what to do.",
        "Edmund: And this is why you don't want me to leave? No other reason?",
        "Cassie: Edmund, the only thing I can think about is hanging onto my little boy. Are you going to help me? I mean, yes or no?",
        "Edmund: Of course, cassie. Of course I will.",

        "Dinah: Ma'am, I can't travel without him.",
        "Flight attendant: Sit please.",
        "Jeffrey: So danny, this argument that you had with tony, what prompted it?",
        "Danny: I don't see why that matters.",
        "Jeffrey: Just tell me, okay. I'll decide that. Well, marina, if you don't mind.",
        "Marina: You know actually i do mind. Okay, look, I know you and my dad have a job to do, but this just happened. So can it wait?",
        "Danny: Marina, it's okay.",
        "Marina: No, it's not okay, danny. Have you looked at your watch? Because it's time for you to go pick up robbie. His son who just lost his uncle and is getting used to having his mother around again, okay? Danny didn't do anything, and he's not going anywhere. So just it the night.",
        "Jeffrey: All right. But I do need a statement.",
        "Danny: Okay. I'll come to your office in the morning.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Danny, I'm sorry for your loss.",
        "Danny: I don't have to pick up robbie.",
        "Marina: Was I out of line?",
        "Danny: Yeah. It's okay, I'm not complaining. The last person I want to see right now is o'neill.",
        "Marina: Kind of figured.",
        "Danny: I'm really sorry.",
        "Marina: For what?",
        "Danny: It's just... I know you did not sign up for this.",
        "Marina: Danny, I don't remember signing anything.",
        "Michelle: So after we came back from vegas, then tony tracked me down here and we went to laurel falls. He was trying to convince me to give him another chance. And I told him that I was confused and I needed to talk to danny. And he got really upset.",
        "Frank: Did danny go there with you?",
        "Michelle: No. I mean, he just showed up. I don't know, he might have been there already. And when tony saw danny he lost it. And at one point he shoved me, and danny had to push him away from me. And they were just really close to the edge, you know, and tony lost his balance and they both went over.",
        "Frank: Michelle, why do you think tony lost it? I mean, did you tell him that you thought that maybe you and danny might be getting back together again?",
        "Michelle: Are you asking me as a police chief or are you asking me as marina's dad?",
        "Frank: Both.",
        "Michelle: Well, I think both of you should mind your own business.",
        "Harley: When is the last time that you saw gus? What did he say to you?",
        "Gus: He got two messages from someone that he was hinting that he knew who the real killer was. And the second message suggested that it was someone who lives in the spaulding house.",
        "Harley: Did he say that he felt that the messages were legit?",
        "Buzz: Yeah.",
        "Harley: Did he have any idea who sent them?",
        "Buzz: He left me a message that he was going to look into it. That's the last I heard of him. I checked all over the place. No one has seen him.",
        "Harley: This is bad. This is really, really bad.",
        "Buzz: I just... I've run out of places to look. I thought maybe you'd have some suggests, you'd have some ideas.",
        "Harley: What if something has happened to him, daddy? What if he's actually hurt? Why didn't you tell me about this before? Sorry, that's my fault.",
        "Buzz: Honey, I didn't want to tell you this time because i knew it would upset you. There's probably a logical explanation for this.",
        "Harley: Like what, he's on a golfing trip?",
        "Buzz: I don't know.",
        "Harley: Of course you don't know, because there isn't one. Gus was living and breathing my case 24 hours a day. He did not just disappear. Something has happened to him. I know it. Either phillip's killer got to him or they're after him. Either way I have to help him. I have to help him.",
        "Disguised voice: What are waiting for? You said you were thirsty?",
        "Gus: Cause you gave me a bottle that's open. You could have put something in here. You want me to drink something, you have to give me a bottle that is sealed. That I will drink.",
        "Disguised voice: Suit yourself. Have a nice night. Stay warm. Oh, and I'll say hello to harley for you.",
        "Gus: If you touch her, I will kill you. I'll kill you.",
        "Edmund: You will not lose will, cassie. I promise you. He's my son, too. And I'm not going to let anything happen to him. I'm not going to let anything happen to any of our children.",
        "Cassie: Okay.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I know you're not inclined to trust me these days.",
        "Cassie: No, I do. I do when it comes to this because I know that you love the boys, and I so... I appreciate you being here, edmund. I really do. ( Crying )",
        "Edmund: It's okay.",
        "Cassie: Look, maybe this was just a mistake.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, please.",
        "Cassie: No, you know, because this isn't fair. Here I am asking you to help me, but I'm not going to give you anything in return. Edmund, I'm sorry, but I'm just not ready to be with you.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I understand. I do. I'm sorry.",
        "Cassie: No. Look, I just want to be honest with you about what this is and what it isn'T. Jeffrey is working on things here. So maybe you could do more good in san cristobel.",
        "Marina: Dad.",
        "Frank: Hold on one second, honey. Michelle, listen, I'm sorry about all the questions, but...",
        "Michelle: I know. I know it's your job. I understand. Look, I got to go talk to danny so we could make these arrangements, okay?",
        "Frank: Okay. I'm very proud of you.",
        "Marina: For what?",
        "Frank: Well, for handling danny the right way. I know you care about him, honey.",
        "Marina: Yeah. Well, I don't want to be with him unless he wants to be with me. You know the old saying: If you love something let it go, and if it comes back to you it was meant to be.",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, unfortunately sometimes they just don't come back.",
        "Marina: Yeah. Well, I have to take that chance.",
        "Michelle: So should we do something for tony at st. Michael's?",
        "Danny: I don't want to talk about that until you answer my question. Why didn't you marry tony? Is it because you wanted us to get back together?",
        "Michelle: If I had, how would you have felt about it?",
        "Danny: If you'd come back from vegas and told me you realized you didn't want to be with tony and I'm the one you want to be with? Michelle, a large part of me would have wanted to say yes. The part of me that loves you and has always loved you.",
        "Michelle: And the other part?",
        "Danny: Michelle, I have worked so hard to move on. There's a part of me, the other part, that cares about marina.",
        "Michelle: I kind of figured that. So which part are you feeling stronger right now? I kind of figured that, too. Oh, boy.",
        "Buzz: Could you repeat that? I could have sworn you said that...",
        "Harley: I said I have to get out of here.",
        "Buzz: Honey, this is a jail. You can'T... you just can't do that. You can't walk out when you feel like it.",
        "Harley: No, but you can. How's your heart?",
        "Buzz: My heart's fine.",
        "Harley: I don't think it is. I think you're going to have a relapse, daddy. You're going to end up in the hospital tonight. Come on. We can get rick to say this is a life-or-death situation. Mel can petition a judge...",
        "Buzz: Honey, no judge is going to do that. You're in here for murder.",
        "Harley: Okay, maybe that's not doable. But there's something else we can do.",
        "Buzz: Honey, listen. No one wants you out of here more than me. But it's not going to happen.",
        "Harley: There's something. I know there's something. Gus could be anywhere right now. I have to do something.",
        "Buzz: Well, you could do it from the inside, you know. Give us ideas. We'll check out places. And when we find him we'll tell you.",
        "Harley: That's not good enough. I can not just sit on the sidelines. Gus could be out there fighting for his life because of me. No. There has to be a way for me to get out of here. There has to be!",
        "Edmund: I will take care of this, cassie. I will make sure you always have your son.",
        "Cassie: Okay. So where do we go from here? What's our first move?",
        "Edmund: I pick up the phone, I get alonzo on the line and i tell him what he's doing to you is completely unacceptable.",
        "Cassie: All right, well, i want to be on the extension. I want to hear everything he says, okay?",
        "Edmund: All right. ( Glass breaking )",
        "Cassie: Miss chitwood? Is everything all right up there? I'm going to go check. I'll be back.",
        "Edmund: Right. I'll get alonzo on the line.",
        "Edmund: Yes, this is edmund winslow. I want you to put me through my brother, the prince, immediately. Cassie, you'll understand just how much you need me.",
        "Frank: Honey, I got to get back to$the station. So if you need anything you just holler, all right?",
        "Marina: Okay.",
        "Danny: You know, your father has every right to not want you to be around me. My life just never really seems to go in the right direction. Marina, we need to talk.",
        "Marina: No, we don'T. And I don't want you to feel bad about it. Okay? You know, danny, I could give you a thousand reasons why we should be together and it's not going to change anything. And I guess deep down I've always known that. Which is why I held back for so long, and it's why I didn't give the relationship everything i had.",
        "Danny: There's still time for that.",
        "Marina: Danny, I don'T...",
        "Danny: Marina, I am so grateful to have you in my life. ( Crying ) I don't know. I don't know what I have done to deserve that. But if you are crazy enough to still want to be with me, I'm yours.",
        "Marina: Danny.",
        "Danny: Is that a yes?",
        "Ross: Michelle?",
        "Jeffrey: Evening, mr. Mayor.",
        "Ross: Jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: How's everything with you?",
        "Ross: I think you know my situation with dinah. So you could probably guess how it's going.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you know what? Maybe things won't be so bad now that edmund has left town.",
        "Ross: Unfortunately edmund has not left town. He was just about to board the plane when cassie shows up, begged him not to go, and he didn'T. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if edmund moved back into the house with cassie and dinah.",
        "Edmund: No, alonzo, i understand. I understand entirely. Will is the heir to the throne. He's the heir to the throne and you have to do what's right for the country. She'll understand. She will. She'll understand. It's okay. I'll bring her along on this. Just let me do it my way, all right? Let me do it my way. All right, thanks very much. Thanks very much. Talk to you later. Bye. Alonzo, that is completely unacceptable. No. No, I think you should reconsider. Reconsider alonzo, because every court in both of the countries is going to back cassie on this. Oh, you don't think so. You don't think so. Fine. We'll see about that? I'm sorry you had to hear that.",
        "Cassie: Okay, so this isn't going to be easy. ( Sighs )",
        "Edmund: No, cassie, I'm afraid we have a fight on our hands. Look, I don't want you to worry. I don't want you to worry. I'm here for you and I'm here for will. You need me. You do. And I'm not going anywhere. I'm not. I love you. I'll be right here.",
        "Buzz: Harley, don't go quiet on me. What are you thinking?",
        "Harley: I'm thinking that you're absolutely right. There is no way a judge is going to let me out of here. If I want to help gus, I'm going to have to do it from the inside like you said.",
        "Buzz: Well, thank you. I was worried there. Let's get a pencil and a piece of paper. Right down all the place you think we'd be able to find him.",
        "Harley: There's no time, daddy. Visiting hours are almost over.",
        "Buzz: So soon?",
        "Harley: I'll tell you what. I'll go back to my cell and I'll write down everything I could think of and I will call you tomorrow, okay?",
        "Buzz: Okay.",
        "Harley: I wish I could hug you. Just hug the boys for me and give them kisses. Tell them I love them so much, okay?",
        "Buzz: I will. Warden.",
        "Mallet: Buzz.",
        "Harley: Warden?",
        "Mallet: What do you want, cooper?",
        "Harley: I wanted to say I'm sorry for earlier, the way i blew you off.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, well, I'm getting used to it.",
        "Harley: Well, you were nice enough to get me all these perfume samples. And I'm going to have to accept the fact that this is where I am now, probably for a long time. And you are the only person who could help me.",
        "Mallet: Yeah. You're just a little frustrated right now. It's a little frightening. You're going through the ups and downs that every con goes through when they first come to this joint. You know, I could make it a lot easier on you if you just let me.",
        "Harley: Yeah. I have an idea about that. Can we talk someplace private, like your office?",
        "Mallet: Okay. All right. Come on. You changed your mind? Got another lead you want me to track down? Harley?",
        "Harley: Not exactly.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Michelle: I need to leave springfield, danny.",
        "Danny: What do you mean, you need a break",
        "Michelle: No, I need more than a break.",
        "Harley: I was wrong and you were right.",
        "Mallet: About?",
        "Harley: About us."
