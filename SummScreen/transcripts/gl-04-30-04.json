        "Edmund: Cassie? Oh, there you are. \n",
        "Cassie: Hi. ",
        "Edmund: Is Tammy home from school yet? \n",
        "\r\nCassie: I'm trying to think about what I'm going to say to her, you know. How do \r\nI phrase this so she doesn't think that I think she's done something wrong?\r\n",
        "Edmund: Yeah. We all had crushes on older \r\npeople when we were younger. It's just Tammy... ",
        "\r\nCassie: Kissed you. She kissed you. And then she wrote about it like it was \r\nokay, and she wrote about it as if you returned the feelings, Edmund. \n",
        "Edmund: We'll work it out, Cassie. \n",
        "Cassie: When she finds out I read that diary, \r\nshe's going to be so angry with me. ",
        "Edmund: We'll work it out. ",
        "Cassie: ...With me? ",
        "Edmund: We'll work it out. ",
        "Cassie: (Sighs) Thank you. Thank you so \r\nmuch.\u00a0 I appreciate that. \u00a0",
        "Edmund: For what? Giving your daughter the \r\nwrong signals? ",
        "\r\nCassie: No. No, you didn\u2019t. Stop saying that. Thank you for being here, Edmund. \r\nThank you for caring enough to work through this with me, and Tammy. I mean, you \r\nguys have gotten so close this past year, I just hate to think this is all going \r\nto fall apart now. (Sighs) ",
        "\n\r\n\u00a0",
        "\r\nEdmund: Just take it one step at a time, all right? I think if we're honest with \r\nTammy and sensitive to her feelings, we'll clear the air and everything will be \r\nfine. ",
        "\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Harley: Mr. O\u2019Neill? ",
        "Jeffrey: Coop. ",
        "Harley: Where have you been all day? \n",
        "Jeffrey: I've been in court. Why, is there a \r\nproblem? ",
        "\r\nHarley: There is progress. Guess who came to see me yesterday? Marie Green. She \r\ndropped a bomb that could blast this case wide open. ",
        "Bill: You have a plan, don't you? ",
        "Eden: Oh, you bet I do. I want to get you...\r\n",
        "Bill: Mm-hmm? ",
        "Eden: ...Out of this place. ",
        "\r\nBill: Well, you could have fooled me because the more you distract me, the \r\nlonger it's going to take to get my work done. Now, young lady, go sit in that \r\ncorner and don't speak until spoken to. ",
        "Eden: Oh, I think I like this game. You are \r\nthe school principal and I am the bad girl. ",
        "Bill: That's the one. That's the... \n",
        "Gus: Hey, I heard that. \u00a0I'm not so sure that \r\nI'm glad that I did. Hm? ",
        "Eden: Oh, and I like when you act like my \r\nbrother. ",
        "Bill: Hey, Gus. You be a great brother-in-law \r\nand do something for me? ",
        "Gus: Eh, brother-in-law? Yeah, sure. What?\r\n",
        "\r\nBill: Would you take your beautiful yet distracting sister out of here, and I'll \r\nmeet you in a half hour? Where are you going to be? ",
        "Gus: I could do that, sure. Beacon. Let's go.\r\n",
        "Bill: Sounds good. ",
        "Eden: You, don't get lost. ",
        "Gus: Let's go. ",
        "Eden: I'm coming. ",
        "Bill: What's that line from \"Last of the \r\nMohicans\"? \"I will find you.\" ",
        "Gus: Oh. I thought it was \"I'll be back.\"\r\n",
        "Eden: What's wrong with him? ",
        "Bill: That's another one. ",
        "Eden: (Laughs) ",
        "Bill: I love you! ",
        "\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Danny: No, no, that's okay. I'll catch a cab \r\nat JFK. Yeah. Okay, see you soon. Hi. ",
        "Michelle: You're going to New York? \n",
        "Danny: Yeah. ",
        "Michelle: To...? ",
        "Danny: Michelle, we agreed, the less you \r\nknow, the better. ",
        "Michelle: Right. ",
        "Danny: I've got to get going, so I'll call \r\nyou when I'm on my way home, okay? ",
        "Michelle: Danny? ",
        "Danny: Yeah? ",
        "Michelle: There's just one thing I need to \r\nknow. ",
        "Danny: Huh? What? ",
        "Michelle: Are you coming back? ",
        "Danny: Michelle, of course, I'm coming back.\r\n",
        "\r\nMichelle: Don't say \"Of course.\" What if Salerno doesn't buy the fact that you \r\nwant back in the mob? What if he smells a set-up? There are a lot of things that \r\ncould go wrong here. ",
        "Danny: Right, they won\u2019t. ",
        "Michelle: So many things, Danny. I don't even \r\nwant to think about it. ",
        "Danny: Well, then don\u2019t. Okay? ",
        "\r\nMichelle: But you've got to tell me something, okay? What are the real chances \r\nhere? Like, what are the odds that you're really going to come home tonight in \r\none piece? ",
        "Danny: Michelle? ",
        "\r\nMichelle: Okay, you know what? Just give me, like, a ballpark figure, like, a \r\n60% chance that you're going to be coming back? ",
        "Danny: (Sighs) Honey... ",
        "Michelle: Better, 75%? ",
        "Danny: Please, don't do this. ",
        "Michelle: No, no. ",
        "Danny: Please. ",
        "\r\nMichelle: I'm just trying to be realistic, okay? I don't want to pretend that \r\neverything's fine and everything's going to be all right when we both know \r\nthere's a good chance that it won\u2019t. So, I've got to keep reminding myself.\r\n",
        "\r\nDanny: 100%. All right? 100%. Here's the deal: My flight is it's at 1:00, at \r\n1:00. The meet is in Queens at 4:00. I figure about an hour with \nSalerno and the other guys, \r\ntops. That puts me on a 6:00 o\u2019clock flight back to Springfield. ",
        "Michelle: Then, what if there's a problem?\r\n",
        "\r\nDanny: 6:00, honey. So, by 8:00, that means I'm going to be here, home, in our \r\nliving room, giving you a big hug. All right? Come here. ",
        "Michelle: (Sighs) okay, 6:00 flight, right?\r\n",
        "Danny: I've got to go. ",
        "Michelle: You promise? ",
        "Danny: I promise. Promise. ",
        "\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "\r\nBill: Yeah, that's right. Absolutely. Yeah, well, you're a smart guy and that's \r\nwhy you're keeping Lewis stock strong. Yeah. All right. Hey, hold up. I've got \r\nanother call, all right? Okay, fine, get right on it. Bill Lewis. Hey, Uncle \r\nJosh. Yeah, thanks for calling me back. No, not business. It's time to talk \r\ntuxes. Yeah, I'm thinking about a crushed purple velvet. Look good, won't it? I \r\ncan't even joke about that with my dad. I think he actually owns one. Yeah. All \r\nright, great. Yeah, I'll talk to you later about it, then. Okay. Yeah, I'm going \r\nto go see Eden right now. All right, great. Oh, hey-- I just want to say thank \r\nyou, and thank you for not letting me quit, okay? Because I am working hard on \r\nmaking lewis construction better than ever. All right? Thanks a lot. And I am \r\ntaking it to places it's never been before. ",
        "\nOlivia: Here's the plan. I am going to be \r\n  selling some of Phillip Spaulding\u2019s stock. No, actually, I can. I have his \r\n  proxy. Yeah, no, it'll be just like a regular sale. You know, you'll put the \r\n  stock on the block and within an hour, I'll call you and I'll buy it back, \r\n  except I'll be using my personal account this time. So, basically I'm just \r\n  transferring the stock from Phillip\u2019s name to mine. Uh, well, um... yeah. I \r\n  mean, I... I have the cash to back up the purchase. Go ahead and make the \r\n  sale, and I'll call you back. Bye. ",

        "\r\nHarley: So, Marie Green comes to see me yesterday out of the blue. She wants to \r\nhire me as a P.I to investigate Brad, who she's convinced is cheating on her \r\nwith someone in San Cristobel, because he spends so much time down there. \n",
        "Jeffrey: In San Cristobel? ",
        "\r\nHarley: Yes. San Cristobel, the same place Spaulding pharmaceutical manufactures \r\ncertain drugs, including antimonious, and the same place where antimonious is \r\nmost easily diverted to the mob, right? ",
        "Jeffrey: That's interesting. ",
        "\r\nHarley: It gets better. So, before Marie even showed up, I was with Eden \r\nAugust-- Gus' sister. When Marie walked in and saw her, she looked ready to \r\nkill. The two of them got into a fight, \nEden left, and when I asked \r\nMarie about it, she admitted it's because when Marie and brad were living over \r\nin Paris, brad was head of the \r\npharmaceutical company over there, and Brad knew Eden. ",
        "Jeffrey: In France, in Paris? ",
        "\r\nHarley: In Paris. But Eden was not alone in Paris. \nEden had a boyfriend in Paris. \r\nGuess who that was? ",
        "Jeffrey: Vinnie Salerno. ",
        "\r\nHarley: Vinnie Salerno. Now, Marie believed that Brad was hanging out with \r\nVinnie because he wanted Eden. He wanted Eden, he wanted me to know. You and I \r\nto both know that Vinnie Salerno was in Paris because he was doing business with \r\nbrad green. And Eden was there, I don't know, as company. ",
        "\r\nJeffrey: And this is right about the same time that antimonious was evolving \r\nfrom a legal pharmaceutical into a street drug. If we can make that connection \r\nstick, cooper, we might have something. ",
        "Harley: See, now, aren't you glad Marie green \r\ndropped into my office? ",
        "\r\nJeffrey: Wait a minute, wait a minute. We cannot discount the fact that Eden \r\nmight be involved in this somehow. ",
        "Harley: Yeah. No, I thought of that, but I \r\nreally think she was just Vinnie's arm candy. ",
        "\r\nJeffrey: Well, you know what? You're going to find out. You're going to find \r\nthat out, and you're going to find a lot more out. ",
        "Harley: But wait, wait, wait a minute. Now, \r\nwhy do I have to find that out? ",
        "Jeffrey: Well, who else is going to \r\ninvestigate it? ",
        "\r\nHarley: I don't know. I thought you'd give it to your people? Don't you have \r\nother people? ",
        "\nJeffrey: Well, why would I do that? Oh. Oh, I \r\n  get it. It's because... it's because Eden\u2019s your future sister-in- law. \r\n  Cooper, you're a professional, at least you keep telling me that. Coop, you're \r\n  not going to let this personal connection affect your ability to do your job, \r\n  are you? ",
        "\n\u00a0",
        "Cassie: I was just wondering if she was there \r\nwith Christie. ",
        "\r\nEdmund: No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to imply that. I just thought she might \r\nbe studying with Ashley. ",
        "Cassie: Oh. ",
        "Edmund: No, no, no. Nothing's wrong. \r\nEverything's fine. ",
        "\r\nCassie: Well, if you do see her, will you please ask her to come home as soon as \r\npossible? ",
        "Edmund: Well, if you do see her, that'd be \r\ngreat. Thank you. ",
        "\r\nCassie: Thank you. No go? She's never stayed away this long without calling to \r\ncheck in. She is definitely avoiding us. ",
        "\r\nEdmund: Oh, no, Cassie. She's avoiding me. She wouldn't be avoiding us. She has \r\nno idea we're lying in wait to have this ridiculously awkward conversation.\r\n",

        "Tammy: Uh, hello? ",
        "Cassie: Hey, sweetheart. ",
        "Tammy: What are you guys doing in my room?\r\n",
        "Cassie: Just, um, wondering where you were. \r\nActually, we wanted to talk to you. ",
        "Tammy: Can it wait? I just got hit with a ton \r\nof homework. Joey's on his way over, so... ",
        "Edmund: No, I'm sorry, Tammy, it can\u2019t.\r\n",
        "\r\nTammy: We have this trigonometry exam. You know, I really think they should have \r\nthis system where your teachers can compare notes so they don't all hit you with \r\nhuge assignments at once, because it's totally not fair. ",
        "Cassie: Edmund told me what happened at the \r\nparty, Tammy. ",
        "Tammy: What party? You mean the after-play \r\nparty? What about it? ",
        "Cassie: I think you know what I'm talking \r\nabout, don't you? ",
        "Tammy: No. I don\u2019t. ",
        "Cassie: What did you do? ",
        "Tammy: What did I do? ",
        "\r\nEdmund: Your mother's talking about what happened out on the terrace, Tammy. \r\nWhen you kissed me. ",
        "Tammy: You told her about that? But you \r\npromised me that you wouldn't tell!! ",
        "Edmund: No, Tammy! You asked me not to tell \r\nyour mother! I never promised you! ",
        "\r\nTammy: We... we talked about it the next day. I admitted it was a huge mistake! \r\nYou told her anyway? ",
        "\r\nCassie: Honey, Edmund was concerned, and he wanted to share his concerns with \r\nme. Now, I think we should sit down and talk about... ",
        "Tammy: I trusted you! I thought you cared \r\nabout me! How can I ever trust you again?",
        "\r\nEdmund: I do care about you, Tammy. I love you as much as if you were my own \r\ndaughter. ",
        "\r\nTammy: Liar! You don't love me! You never loved me! All this time, you were just \r\npretending to love me so that mom would think you were a good guy like Richard. \r\nWell, you're not, Edmund. You're just a mean, horrible person. I hate you!\r\n",
        "\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Harley: It\u2019s not that I don't think I can be \r\nobjective about Eden. ",
        "Jeffrey: Well, then what is the problem?\r\n",
        "Harley: The problem is my life! ",
        "Jeffrey: No, nice try but no cigar. Get to \r\nwork, terrier. Ruff-ruff. ",
        "Gus: Hey, honey! ",
        "Harley: Hey! ",
        "Gus: You're here! ",
        "Harley: Hey, you're here! What are you guys \r\nup to? ",
        "Gus: You're going to join us, right? \n",
        "\r\nEden: I was just updating Nicky on the wedding plans. I chose a florist, got \r\nbill's tux-- which not only does it fit him like a glove, and I got it on sale.\r\n",
        "Harley: Good. ",
        "Eden: We need to schedule a fitting for your \r\ndress. ",
        "Harley: Whatever you need, I am flexible.\r\n",
        "Eden: Wait until you see your fianc\u00e9e in her \r\ndress. She amazing. ",
        "Gus: Yeah? ",
        "\r\nEden: Everyone's going to be asking you guys when you're tying the knot, so will \r\nyou get that date now? ",
        "Gus: Oh... ",
        "Eden: Oh... ",
        "\r\nGus: We've been thinking of talking about... how was your day, honey? What did \r\nyou do today? ",
        "Eden: (Laughs) ",
        "Harley: Just been running around. ",

        "Bellhop: Ms. August? There's a message for \r\nyou at the front desk. ",
        "Eden: For me? Um, you know what? It has to be \r\nthat caterer I've been trying to get a hold of. He's here at the beacon. \n",
        "Harley: Good. ",
        "Gus: Yeah. ",
        "Eden: I'll be right back. ",
        "Harley: Good. ",
        "Gus: She seems happy. ",
        "Harley: Yeah. ",
        "Gus: When she's happy, you know, it makes me \r\nfeel happy. ",
        "Harley: That's good. ",
        "Gus: Yeah. ",
        "\r\nHarley: Actually, that's amazing if you think about it; because you guys were \r\nestranged for what was it, almost a year? ",
        "Gus: Yeah, almost, a year. ",
        "\r\nHarley: So how's she doing? You think she's being straight? You think she\u2019s... \r\nshe's not keeping anything from you? ",
        "Gus: No, no, no. Come on. She's been straight \r\nfor a while now. ",
        "\r\nHarley: I know. It's just that she was in that other world for a long time, you \r\nknow? With that Salerno stuff. ",
        "Gus: No, no, no. It was a long time ago.\r\n",
        "Harley: So you think she's, you know, she's \r\nnot seeing Salerno. He's not bothering her. ",
        "\r\nGus: No. Well, at least, you know, in her mind, the way she's living her life. \r\nSalerno might be another story, you know, but we made a pact, she and I, that if \r\nhe comes near her, she comes to me first, and I'll handle it. ",
        "Harley: Good. Because you know guys like \r\nSalerno. They can be really persistent. ",
        "\r\nGus: Well, she's very determined, determined to have a great life with bill, and \r\nbelieve me, nobody or no one is going to get in the way of that. ",
        "Eden: Thanks. ",

        "Oscar: I'm surprised you're giving him the \r\ntime of day, Vinnie. ",
        "Salerno: I'll hear him out, okay? If it was \r\nyou, I'd do the same courtesy. ",
        "Oscar: Yeah, well, it wouldn't be me. I \r\nwouldn't mess up like he did. ",
