        "Reva went to the Spaulding mansion and told Alexandra that her \"feelings\" are telling her that Alan is not her stalker. Alan was outside the window, smiling, as he listened. Alex said that all the evidence points to Alan as being the stalker. When Reva came into contact with Alex, she flinched, then told Alex that she's in serious danger. Reva then told a shaken Alex that she senses that the stalker is somebody Alan knows, that Alan knows this and is plotting revenge. After her little act, Reva left. Alan arrived at Harley's and, in a pleasant mood, as he was beginning to tell her and Gus about a plan he's hatched to get revenge on Alex, Reva arrived. Reva told Alan that by the time she left the mansion, Alexandra was left shaking in her boots. Alan and Reva laughed about their plan as Gus and Harley listened. When Gus suggested Alan let Alex squirm and suffer before reeling her in, Alan told Gus he likes the way he thinks---and called him \"son\". Harley took Reva aside as a down-to- earth Alan told Gus that everything Regina said was the complete truth, that the news had thrown him for a loop and now he truly believes that Gus is his son. After Gus went off with Reva to prepare Alan some breakfast, Harley told Alan that yesterday he ran both Regina and Gus through the wringer, but now that he needs Gus' help, he's being too nice and welcoming to Gus, warning Alan that if he's jerking Gus around to do his bidding, he'll be sorry. She also warned Alan about trying to get Gus into the backstabbing Spaulding ways. Later, as Harley was filling Reva in about the connection between Alan and Gus, Gus told Alan that Alexandra should be made to suffer. Alan slowly turned to Gus and told him that he spoke \"like a true Spaulding\".",
        "A pro baseball scout went to \"Company\" and told Marina he's been keeping an eye on Shayne's remarkable talent and Marina sat with him and wholeheartedly endorsed Shayne. Later, Josh and Shayne entered and sat with the scout to discuss Shayne's talent, but Josh was a little too enthusiastic and over- bearing. Later, the scout spoke to Marina about Shayne's father's attitude and asked her to speak to Josh. As Josh was leaving, Marina relayed what the scout had said to her, that sometimes the fathers of promising, up and coming athletes are too overbearing and overzealous and try to monopolize their sons' budding careers, but Josh laughed and told Marina that she must have misunderstood the scout. He told Marina to mind her own business and that Shayne's future is HIS concern. Later, Buzz took Josh aside and told him that he overheard the scout talking to Marina and that Marina didn't misunderstand at all. Josh told Buzz that when he was Shayne's age, he had a chance to become a pro-baseball player, but that he blew his chance and doesn't want Shayne to make the same mistakes HE made. Outside, Shayne was overcome with excitement at the prospect that the scout is interested in him and will be watching when the next game is played.",
        "When Lizzie noticed a stack of mail for Phillip, Nolan informed her that Phillip's moved out and is living at a loft somewhere. Lizzie ordered Nolan to send the driver around to take her to Phillip's. Just as Phillip was telling Olivia how he's dreading to tell Lizzie about all the changes that have occurred since she was last in town, Lizzie arrived at the loft. Lizzie was irritated to learn that Olivia was living with Phillip, then Lizzie noticed that Olivia is pregnant. Keeping her true feelings under wraps, she asked her father if he was happy, and when Phillip said he was, Lizzie told him that's all that mattered. After Phillip left the room to get Lizzie some money, Olivia told Lizzie she's glad she's back, then said she wants Lizzie to be a part of the baby's life. Lizzie snidely told Olivia she doesn't know if the baby will be her brother or sister OR her uncle or aunt, and told Olivia she's obviously found a way to make a permanent foothold in the Spaulding family. Later, Lizzie met up with Tammy and the two went to \"Company\". Lizzie was floored when she found out that Tammy already knew that Olivia was pregnant and living with Phillip. Lizzie then overheard part of a radio show where Alan's sanity was being discussed. After Tammy turned the radio down, Lizzie fumed that everyone seems bent on keeping secrets from her. Back at the loft, both Olivia and Phillip agreed that Lizzie seemed to handle the news TOO calmly. A frantic Alexandra arrived, telling them that Alan's stalking her. After telling them about the phone call, Olivia and Phillip were skeptical. Alexandra told Phillip that his father's crazy as a loon and is coming after them and that they have to go on the offense. Before leaving, she looked pointedly at Phillip and cryptically told him that she's not the only one with a vested interest in this....."

        "Reva: Alexandra? Nolan let me in. Is there still no word on Alan? So sorry though I goofed up the way I did the other day.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, goofed, huh? You told me my brother may be drowned at the bottom... They dredged the entire lake-- the police did-- looking for him.",
        "Reva: Now, just hold on, Alex. I never said that I saw Alan in the lake. I said that I saw water around him. I'm still getting the hang of this whole vision thing.",
        "Alexandra: Really? Well, would you please try practicing on someone else?",
        "Reva: So I guess you don't want to hear the message I received this morning.",
        "Alexandra: If it's about Alan, no, thank you.",
        "Reva: It came to me clear as a bell.",
        "Alexandra: What did I just say, Reva?",
        "Reva: Alan is not the stalker, Alexandra. It's not him.",
        "Alexandra: Well, I... Given the evidence the police have, they seem to think otherwise. And it pains me to say it, but I have to agree with them.",
        "Reva: Well, they're wrong, and that's why I have to help you find Alan, so that I can prove it.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, Reva, Reva, please, please stay out of this now.",
        "Reva: Alex...",
        "Alexandra: Thank you very much.",
        "Reva: (Gasps)",
        "Alexandra: What? Well, what?",
        "Reva: Nothing. Nothing.",
        "Alexandra: You saw something. Now, what?",
        "Reva: Danger. Terrible danger.",
        "Alexandra: Oh. What? Alan's in danger?",
        "Reva: No. You are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Here.",
        "Phillip: Thanks.",
        "Olivia: Sure.",
        "Phillip: Keep feeling like I should have listened to my gut last night and gone over to see about Lizzie.",
        "Olivia: You know what? You're going to be there when she wakes up this morning.",
        "Phillip: This poor kid. She runs away to boarding school to get away from things because they're crazy around here, and then her dorm goes up in flames. And now she comes back here looking for a little comfort serenity and I've got to tell her that things are crazier here than when she left.",
        "Olivia: I know. Beth didn't say anything to her? She didn't... She doesn't know that you moved out and that we're living together?",
        "Phillip: No, or that you're pregnant or that Alan is missing. I don't know... How in the world do you break this many changes to a teenager all at once?",
        "Olivia: Very carefully.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nolan: Hello, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Nolan?",
        "Nolan: Yeah.",
        "Lizzie: Why is all this mail for my dad sitting out here?",
        "Nolan: I've been collecting it so I can bring it to him.",
        "Lizzie: Bring it to him?",
        "Nolan: Mm-hmm. He has a new home.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, well, I was just about to head over there. I'll save you the trip. Do me a favor. Buzz Stuart and have him bring the car around. He knows dad's new address, right?",
        "Nolan: Yeah, he does. But I really...",
        "Lizzie: But what?",
        "Nolan: (Sighs) Nothing, nothing. I'm sure it'll be fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: (Sighs) Hi. You know what you want?",
        "Scout: Hmm.",
        "Marina: Sir?",
        "Scout: How old are you?",
        "Marina: I'm a little young for you to be hitting on me, that's for sure.",
        "Scout: Whoa, whoa, whoa. I wasn't. I was just wondering if you were still in high school. Maybe you know a kid named Shayne Lewis?",
        "Marina: Maybe. Who's asking.",
        "Scout: Sarge McNown. I'm a scout, as in baseball.",
        "Marina: Really? Which college?",
        "Scout: No college, pro.",
        "Marina: Really?",
        "Scout: Mm-hmm.",
        "Marina: Wow! Then I just happen to be your girl, Mr. McNown. I am a certified expert on Shayne Lewis.",
        "Scout: Uh-huh?",
        "Marina: Mm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: I looked everywhere for him, everywhere. I looked at the bridge, under the bridge, over the bridge.",
        "Harley: You're doing a lot more for him than I ever would considering the way he treated you and Lucia.",
        "Gus: But he's my father. He's my father.",
        "Harley: Probably would never admit that, let alone accept that.",
        "Gus: Now, what if he's in trouble? I'm serious. What if... What if the drugs aren't out of his system? If he got hurt, we'd never know. Maybe he's running around town thinking lizard people are after him. I... I don't know. But what if he steps in front of a train? (Knock on door) What now? Alan!",
        "Alan: Morning.",
        "Gus: Good morning.",
        "Alan: Oh, thanks for the coffee. I need it.",
        "Gus: Thanks for the coffee? You need it? Alan, where... What is going on? Where have you been?",
        "Harley: Gus has been looking for you all night.",
        "Alan: I had some things I had to sort out, and I realized I was a bit hasty at rejecting your offer to help me. The most important thing for me right now is to clear my name. And if you can help me in any way, I...",
        "Gus: Right, right, right. Calm down. Just take it easy. We'll deal with all that stuff. Are you okay?",
        "Alan: Yes, I'm fine.",
        "Gus: Well, good. That... That's really good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Shayne Lewis is the best pro prospect this town has seen in years, Mr. McNown. You got to try the pancakes. They're to die for. He's got a 1.13 era. He's got two no-hitters under his belt. The season has just started. He's like a strikeout machine. Are you going to need more bacon than this?",
        "Scout: No.",
        "Marina: You have heard about his signature pitch, right? It's the \"Lewis Lowrider.\" And his fastball is mid-'90s. He's got an awesome curve. And off the field, the guy is just a complete dream. I mean, he is sweet. He's smart. He's really hard working. He's got a 3.5 grade point average. And I'm telling you, sir, you could not ask for a better team player. You just couldn't.",
        "Scout: Sounds like you know Shayne pretty well, Marina.",
        "Marina: Oh, I do, I do. Very well.",
        "Scout: Hmm.",
        "Marina: Oh, no. No, not like that. I have a boyfriend, Ben. Shayne and I are just friends. You know, of course I do give him advice on the game, though.",
        "Scout: Mm, of course.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: So... So how is that new equipment working out for you at the gym?",
        "Shayne: I like the stuff. You know, you should come check it out.",
        "Josh: I think that would be great. I would love that.",
        "Buzz: Hey, hey, hey. See the guy that my spunky granddaughter is charming silly over there?",
        "Shayne: Mm-hmm.",
        "Buzz: He's a pro scout.",
        "Shayne: Pro?",
        "Buzz: Yeah.",
        "Josh: Really?",
        "Buzz: Yeah. Guess who he's in town to see.",
        "Josh: No kidding.",
        "Buzz: Yeah.",
        "Josh: Thank you. I appreciate that. Come on, son. Marina. Hi there.",
        "Marina: Hi, Shayne, Mr. Lewis. You have excellent timing. Shayne this is...",
        "Josh: I'm Joshua Lewis. How are you? You are?",
        "Scout: McNown. Sarge McNown.",
        "Josh: Well, it's nice to meet you, sir. I understand you want to talk to my son. Shayne, this is Mr. McNown.",
        "Shayne: Hi. It's nice to meet you.",
        "Scout: Well, I'm glad to meet you, Shayne. Marina was just giving me your stats. She's quite a fan.",
        "Josh: He's got a lot of fans in this town, that's for sure. Why don't you slide on in, son, all right? Marina, could you bring me a cup of coffee, please? And maybe-- I don't know-- a glass of milk or something for Shayne? Excuse me. Thanks. So where are you from?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: She's going to be okay because she has you-- and Beth.",
        "Phillip: You know, I guess if anything were really wrong last night or this morning, Beth probably would've called me.",
        "Olivia: Beth spent the night at the Spaulding mansion?",
        "Phillip: Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's right. I forgot to tell you. She moved back in. I'm not sure for how long.",
        "Olivia: So she can be near Lizzie?",
        "Phillip: No, actually she made the decision before that. It was Alex's idea. I think the two of them are a little lonely at the moment.",
        "Olivia: Well, that's a little unorthodox, don't you think? Your ex-wife living in your family home? Are you sure you're okay with that?",
        "Phillip: Yeah, I think it's all right. I think it'll be good to have the kids under the same roof. It doesn't matter. We're not living there right now. Why? Do you have a problem with it?",
        "Olivia: No, no, no. Listen, go. Tell Lizzie I said hello and I'm glad she's okay.",
        "Phillip: Okay, I will. I'll see you later. Lizzie? Hi, darling. How are you?",
        "Lizzie: I'm okay.",
        "Phillip: I was just coming to see you. You okay?",
        "Lizzie: I'm fine.",
        "Phillip: Well, how... how did you know that I was living here?",
        "Lizzie: Olivia? What are you doing here?",
        "Phillip: Um... Olivia... We're living here together right now. Honey, come on in and sit down, and I will try to explain this to you.",
        "Lizzie: You're pregnant?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Are you hungry? You want some breakfast? You want something to eat?",
        "Alan: Why are you being so nice to me?",
        "Harley: That's a very good question.",
        "Gus: This is what's called normal, people. If a person has a mental breakdown, if they're running around the streets all night wandering around, if they almost kill themselves, expressing a little concern for that person is not completely out of the ordinary, you know what I mean?",
        "Alan: Yes. But I just thought that maybe after the way I talked to you and Regina... Well, what I said could be perceived as unkind.",
        "Gus: Kind of like saying that I was kind to you, scamming you, that my mother's a slut, that we're both gold diggers. Yeah, that was one of your finer moments.",
        "Harley: But of course there have been so many.",
        "Gus: Look, Alan, you can deny that you're my father all you want, you know, but the truth is you're in trouble, and I am your son, and it is my duty to help you.",
        "Harley: Alan, where were you last night?",
        "Alan: Conducting research. Figuring out how to give my sister her just reward.",
        "Gus: Did you come up with anything interesting?",
        "Alan: Not only did I come up with something interesting, it's already set in motion.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: I'm in danger, huh? Well, Reva, you know, you must be mistaken about that.",
        "Reva: I mean, right. Why would you... Why would you be in danger? I mean, you haven't done anything wrong. But neither did Alan, Alexandra. I'm sure of it. So if you would just let me help you find him...",
        "Alexandra: Reva please, will you just let the police handle this?",
        "Reva: If I could just stay in the house for a while and touch some more of his things, maybe I could get a clearer read of exactly where he is.",
        "Alexandra: Come on. You want to sit down here at the desk like you did the other day and try... I mean, come on. (Laughs) And practically, you know, predict my brother's death.",
        "Reva: I know. I'm sorry. I guess I want to help because I feel so guilty.",
        "Alexandra: Guilty?",
        "Reva: Yes, guilty that Alan was wrongly accused, that your family has been through such an ordeal. I mean, in a way, you've been just as victimized as I was. I mean, what kind of a person would do something like this to other people, to ruin people's lives, and why?",
        "Alexandra: Well, maybe someone who wasn't thinking particularly clearly. I mean, someone who's troubled...",
        "Reva: Not him. Not Alan. But Alan knows who it was. He knows. And... and he's going to get revenge. You had a call, Alexandra. Last night you had a call and there was no one on the other end of the line and that frightened you. I'm... I'm going to just get out of your hair now. And whatever I said about you being in any kind of danger, I'm... I'm really sure it was nothing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: You were developing quite a rapport with that guy.",
        "Marina: Well, yeah, I guess.",
        "Buzz: Until Josh stepped in and took over.",
        "Marina: Yeah, yeah. Well, he's Shayne's dad. It's his job. I just... I don't know.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, you just what?",
        "Marina: Okay, well, first of all, it's whatever's best for Shayne, because that's the most important thing. But I guess I just really liked having that guy, you know, listen to me and take me so seriously.",
        "Buzz: I listen to you. I take you seriously. Your father takes you seriously.",
        "Marina: Yeah, but you think I'm brilliant no matter what I did. It's just nice when someone else does it.",
        "Buzz: Does Ben take you seriously?",
        "Marina: Oh, please. Ben thinks I'm a goddess. He kneels at me feet, tosses me cars left and right.",
        "Buzz: And Shayne-- does he thinks you're a goddess?",
        "Marina: And that guy Mr. McNown, too. I am telling you, we kind of had this whole, like, respect vibe thing going on, you know? Maybe that's what I'll do if the whole rock star thing doesn't pan out, which of course it will, so I guess this would have to be, you know, in addition to my singing career. But...",
        "Buzz: What would?",
        "Marina: You know, I could, like... I could be an agent or something. I could... I could rep people who I think are really talented, like Shayne for example. I mean, I think that would be a really cool thing to do, you know? Just help people out who you believe in.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, that'd be cool. That'd be very, very cool.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scout: So you generally feel good about the advice Coach Hazlett gives you?",
        "Shayne: Yeah. I mean, every call he's made this season has been right on the money.",
        "Josh: Well, not every call actually. You know he didn't start you against that game at Fairview, right?",
        "Shayne: Chip Whitman was pitching well.",
        "Josh: Yeah, but not as well as you would have done against that big old left hander that they have. In fact, you would've struck him out. I'm sure of that.",
        "Shayne: Maybe.",
        "Josh: Maybe? Definitely. With your fastball... Have you heard about his fastball?",
        "Scout: Yeah, yeah, I've heard about it, and I'm looking forward to seeing it at the next game. But right now I got another appointment, so...",
        "Josh: Hey, listen, do you want to come by the house tonight for dinner? A little home-cooked meal?",
        "Scout: Oh, no, thanks. I've got plans. I'll see you soon.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Scout: And we'll talk more, okay?",
        "Shayne: Okay.",
        "Josh: Nice meeting you. You did good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scout: That's your change.",
        "Marina: Thank you.",
        "Scout: Marina, you like your pal Shayne, right? And you want him to be a success?",
        "Marina: Yeah, of course. Why?",
        "Scout: Then can I talk to you for a minute in private.",
        "Marina: Yeah. What about?",
        "Scout: Shayne's father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: Okay, first things first. You have been through quite an ordeal. Are you okay?",
        "Lizzie: I already told you I'm fine. And she's pregnant? Yes, no?",
        "Phillip: Yes. I was waiting to tell you that in person. I'm sure that you're shocked, and you're probably a little hurt and angry. That's completely understandable.",
        "Lizzie: I'm none of those things. A little shocked, but... I need you to answer a question. Are you happy, Daddy?",
        "Phillip: Yes.",
        "Lizzie: Are you, Olivia?",
        "Olivia: Yes.",
        "Lizzie: And this is what you both want?",
        "Phillip: Yeah.",
        "Lizzie: So you and Grandpa, that's over with? You never really loved him, or you just changed your mind?",
        "Phillip: Lizzie...",
        "Lizzie: I'm sorry. That was a dumb thing to say. You and Grandpa were having problems since day one. I guess it just wasn't meant to be.",
        "Olivia: Would you excuse me? There's something I need to... to do.",
        "Phillip: Okay, you're angry. That's okay. You have every right to be. In your shoes I would be, too. Honey, I know one of the reasons that you wanted to go away to school is to get away from all the craziness around here. And now you come home and you see that your world is really turned upside down.",
        "Lizzie: Is it yours? The baby? Are you the father?",
        "Phillip: Lizzie...",
        "Lizzie: You don't know? Oh, Daddy, you poor thing. Talk about a bizarre situation. What are you going to do about it?",
        "Phillip: I'm weighing my options, all right? And that's enough about me. I don't want to talk about that anymore. I want to talk about you. You, young lady. Why did you runaway from school? Why did you do that?",
        "Lizzie: I didn't run away. The fire just freaked me out, and all I could think about was getting home where it was safe.",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm. But without calling anybody? I would've sent the jet for you; you know that.",
        "Lizzie: I didn't want to bother you.",
        "Phillip: You... Honey, I'm your father.",
        "Lizzie: Look, I reacted the way I reacted. Maybe I wasn't thinking straight. But it's over, and I'm happy to be back here and away from that place. It's...",
        "Phillip: Wait a minute. You're talking about school? I thought you loved it there.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, I do. It's just, this may childish, but I was homesick. I missed you and Mom and my friends like crazy.",
        "Phillip: I missed you, too. I missed you so much.",
        "Lizzie: I'm never going away again.",
        "Phillip: (Laughs) Okay. Sounds good to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Knock on door)",
        "Gus: Come on. Come on.",
        "Reva: Hi, Harley.",
        "Harley: Hi, Reva.",
        "Reva: You look good.",
        "Harley: Thanks. I... I actually was on my way out. Sorry.",
        "Reva: Oh, that's okay. I'm... I'm here to see Alan.",
        "Harley: Alan? What makes you think that Alan's here?",
        "Alan: Because I told her.",
        "Reva: Alan dropped by to pay me a visit last night and convinced me that we both have something in common: That we both want to see the real stalker punished.",
        "Harley: Oh. So you think it's Alex, too?",
        "Reva: Well, I suspected, but now I'm pretty certain.",
        "Alan: Yes, and Reva paid Alexandra a little visit and convinced her that she'd had some very disturbing visions about her.",
        "Reva: That she was in terrible danger, that someone with an ax to grind was coming after her and fully intended to inflict serious, serious harm. (Laughter )",
        "Harley: And she bought this?",
        "Reva: Yes.",
        "Alan: Yes.",
        "Reva: Hook, line, and sinker. And now she's running scared-- very scared.",
        "Alan: Great.",
        "Gus: Good job, I guess. Good job, big Al.",
        "Harley: So what's the next step?",
        "Alan: Well, we reel her in.",
        "Gus: No, no. No, I think you should make her squirm. I think you should make her suffer.",
        "Alan: Mm, I like the way you think, son.",
        "Gus: You just called me son?",
        "Harley: Reva, could I...",
        "Reva: Mm-hmm.",
        "Gus: So you... you suddenly believe it now? That I am your son?",
        "Alan: I was in denial at first, but when you brought Regina here, I knew it was true.",
        "Gus: You didn't act like it.",
        "Alan: Well, I was pretty overwhelmed. I mean everything that's happened in my life in the past few weeks. I want you to know one thing: Everything your mother said was absolutely true. We were very close. Circumstances kept us from being together, but I thought of her many times over the years. And then when I discovered we had a child together...",
        "Gus: You want some breakfast?",
        "Alan: Yeah, yeah, that would be good. Yeah.",
        "Gus: Harley. I'm going attempt to make some eggs.",
        "Harley: I'll give you a hand.",
        "Gus: Yeah?",
        "Harley: Mm-hmm.",
        "Gus: Thanks.",
        "Harley: So, now you believe that Gus is your son, huh?",
        "Alan: Yes, I do.",
        "Harley: You better, Alan. This better not be you playing a game. You better not be jerking him around to do your bidding. Because if you are, you'll be very sorry.",

        "Josh: I can't even read this.",
        "Marina: Oh, you know what? Don't worry about it. It's on the house.",
        "Josh: Oh, great. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.",
        "Marina: So how did everything go with the scout?",
        "Josh: You know what? So far, so good.",
        "Marina: Awesome. Mr. Lewis.",
        "Josh: Yeah?",
        "Marina: Okay, okay, I don't... I don't really know how to say this, so I'm just going to, you know, come right out with it. Mr. McNown, he pulled me aside and he was kind of telling me some stuff.",
        "Josh: Stuff?",
        "Marina: Yeah. Just about how, you know, a lot of times parents of top high school athletes, particularly the fathers, they really want their kids to do well, you know. And when you have a scout like Mr. McNown and when he first meets a perspective player, what he's really interested in is getting a sense of the player personally, you know.",
        "Josh: Okay. So?",
        "Marina: So, a lot of times the fathers don't really get that and they keep inserting themselves in the conversation, kind of like monopolizing it. And I kind of got the feeling that he might have been talking about you.",
        "Josh: About me?",
        "Marina: Yeah. Yeah, so you know I was just going to pass that information along because he kind of gave me the impression he wanted me to and...",
        "Josh: Let me just make sure I understand what you're saying here. This pro baseball scout wanted you, Marina Cooper, 17 years-old to pass this message on to me?",
        "Marina: Yeah. Mm-hm.",
        "Josh: Okay. Thank you.",
        "Marina: Wait. What? Yeah, I mean, you think I just, you know, decided to make this up or something?",
        "Josh: No, no, no. I think it's possible that you misunderstood what he was trying to say.",
        "Marina: Okay, yeah, I'm pretty sure I didn't misunderstand him. His meaning was pretty clear. The last thing I'd want to do is to hurt your feelings. (Josh laughs) But I think we both understand how important this guy could be to Shayne's career. You wouldn't want to, you know, alienate him, right?",
        "Josh: You know what? You're a great kid, Marina. You really are. And I appreciate the fact that you've been so supportive of Shayne. You know, you've gone to all his games and you're cheering for him. And I think that means a lot to him. But I think when it comes to his future, that's my deal. By that I mean it's my responsibility, okay? It's my territory. Mine and his mom and pros like this scout, right?",
        "Marina: Yeah.",
        "Josh: Would you agree with that?",
        "Marina: Absolutely. Absolutely. I was just trying to say that...",
        "Josh: And I also know that you are very enthusiastic about a lot of things, and that's great. But I think in this particular situation, you should just back off a little bit, you know. Maybe stay out of it. You wouldn't want to say something, you know, accidentally say something wrong to this guy, right? Something that might hurt Shayne's chances? If you did that, I think that you would feel very bad about it.",
        "Marina: Yeah, I think I'd feel bad about it if anyone were to do that. Excuse me.",
        "Buzz: I need a word with you.",
        "Josh: (Sighs)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: All right, ladies, I'm going to take you to breakfast.",
        "Lizzie: I would love to, but I already promised Tammy I'd meet her at Company. So I wouldn't feel right backing out on her.",
        "Phillip: Hmm. My thoughtful, responsible daughter.",
        "Lizzie: You may not think I'm so responsible after you find out what I did. I blew my whole month's allowance on my bus ride home from school. Now I'm totally tapped out.",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. See, now this is another reason why you should have let me send the jet for you. I'm pretty sure I got a little cash in the other room.",
        "Olivia: You know that your dad isn't the only person who's happy that you're home. We're both really counting on you to be a part of this baby's life.",
        "Lizzie: Your my little brother or sister... Or aunt or uncle. It's still a mystery, right?",
        "Olivia: I guess what's important is that this baby is going to be your family and he or she is really going to need you to show them the ropes.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, I'm sure he you'll give them the down low on the family just fine, Olivia. Now that you've figured out a way to stay in it for good.",
        "Phillip: Take this, sweetheart. That should take care of it.",
        "Lizzie: Thanks, Dad. You're the best.",
        "Phillip: I love you. You have fun. Call me.",
        "Lizzie: I will.",

        "Lizzie: Olivia... Congratulations.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Okay, Buzz, what's up?",
        "Buzz: What Marina told you, that that scout said, she wasn't making it up. I heard what he said. And she passed it along, you know, verbatim.",
        "Josh: Almost.",
        "Buzz: Well, she was kinder than he was.",
        "Josh: (Laughs) Buzz, come on. Now... now why would a pro baseball scout use Marina to pass some message along to me?",
        "Buzz: Well, maybe he's seeing you screw up your son's chances and he wants to get you out of your own way without offending you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shayne: So what exactly were you talking about with my dad while I was on the phone.",
        "Marina: Shayne, nothing. So how cool it is that a pro baseball scout came all the way to Springfield to see you?",
        "Shayne: You know he's going to come to my next game. Oh, man, this is one time I can not afford to mess up.",
        "Marina: Oh, no, you're not going to mess up. You're going to be fine. You just can't be nervous, okay? I mean that.",
        "Shayne: Okay. I won't. As long as you're there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I have missed this place so much. Is it too early for chocolate sundae?",
        "Tammy: Never. Hey, there's Marina. Let's say hi.",
        "Lizzie: Later, okay? She's preoccupied. I guess she's not seeing Ben Reade anymore.",
        "Tammy: Oh, no, they're still together. In fact he just bought her a car.",
        "Lizzie: So what's that about?",
        "Tammy: Oh, she and Shayne are just friends. Same as always. Marina's into baseball, and this year Shayne is Mr. Baseball.",
        "Lizzie: Well, it looks like he still has a thing for her and she's still leading him on. Typical Marina.",
        "Tammy: So, did your parents freak when they found out you left school on your own without telling anyone?",
        "Lizzie: Not to bad. They have other things on their minds. My dad's living with Olivia, my grandfather's ex. Can you believe it?",
        "Tammy: You're kidding.",
        "Lizzie: It's too gross for words, Tammy. I mean to think that... This isn't news to you. You knew about this?",
        "Tammy: Only because my mom works with Olivia. It's not like it's common knowledge or anything.",
        "Lizzie: Why didn't you tell me?",
        "Tammy: I just didn't think it was my place. I'm sorry.",
        "Lizzie: Olivia's pregnant. Did you know that, too? So everyone knows more about my own family than I do.",
        "Sandy: Okay, take a chill pill, Mole.",
        "Tammy: Lizzie, no one kept it from you. It's just like...",
        "Sandy: If you keep ranting like this you're going to spontaneously combust.",
        "Lizzie: Who's that?",
        "Mole: Well, I'm upset, man. You should be, too. With that cracker jack Alan Spaulding running around free, none of us are safe.",
        "Lizzie: What's this show.",
        "Tammy: \"Sammie and the Mole.\"",
        "Mole: That cat is crazy. I'm not talking about, like wearing white after Labor Day crazy. I'm talking about, like hack you off with two little jars and sell you...",
        "Lizzie: What are they saying about my grandfather? This is what you almost told me last night, isn't it?",
        "Tammy: Like I said, it wasn't my place.",
        "Lizzie: How could my parents keep this from me? How?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: So how did Lizzie seem to you?",
        "Phillip: I'm not sure. Pretty calm considering everything. Maybe a little too calm.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, Phillip, look I... (Knock at the door)",
        "Phillip: You expecting someone?",
        "Olivia: No.",
        "Phillip: Alexandra.",
        "Alexandra: Thank goodness you're here.",
        "Phillip: Why? Hey, is it something about Alan? Did you hear something?",
        "Alexandra: Your father has surely gone round the bend. He has started stalking me now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: I realize you might have some mixed feelings about discovering that Gus is a Spaulding.",
        "Harley: No. No mixed feelings. I hate it.",
        "Alan: That's right. Of course you hate it, because Spaulding's are the root of all evil. That's the Cooper party line, isn't it?",
        "Harley: I could only tell you what I see, Alan.",
        "Alan: What is it you see?",
        "Harley: I see Gus showing up in this town filled with anger. And then I see him working very, very hard to get out of that place and to become the man that he is now, a gentle and kind man. And if anybody should try to pull him back to that place of negativity, especially under guise of family loyalty, they would have to deal with me. Do you understand?",
        "Alan: What is it exactly that you're so upset about?",
        "Harley: You were here yesterday and you were putting Regina and Gus through an emotional wringer. Now today you decide that you need Gus' help to further this agenda that you have against Alexandra. And you're calling him \"son.\" Do I look that stupid?",
        "Alan: From what I can tell, Gus and I have the same agenda-- as does Reva. We only want...",
        "Harley: Revenge. Revenge, Alan.",
        "Alan: No. Justice. And the way that Alexandra has treated you, I would think you'd want the same thing.",
        "Gus: We don't have enough eggs, so I put a waffle in the toaster. Is that all right?",
        "Alan: Actually...",
        "Reva: And I'm going to take off. But you guys will let me know as soon as you know what the next step is going to be.",
        "Gus: Thanks for your help, Reva.",
        "Harley: I'll walk you out.",
        "Reva: See ya.",
        "Gus: Everything all right with you and Harley?",
        "Alan: Couldn't be better. Now let us discuss what we're going to do to my sister to make her regret the day she was born.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Buzz, I appreciate the fact that you're protective of your granddaughter. You know, I'm the same way. I'm protective of my son. But when I was his age, I had a chance to make it in baseball. Maybe even make it to the pros. I made some bad choices and it hurt me. So if there's anything I can do to help Shayne, to keep him from making those same mistakes, I'm going to do that. And if that means some scout thinks I'm being a little pushy, maybe that's his problem. Take care.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: I think you're definitely going to pitch a no hitter.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, well, I'll do my best.",
        "Josh: Hey, son, I'm heading to the office. You want a ride?",
        "Shayne: No, I'm going to hang out with Marina a little longer.",
        "Josh: Okay. All right. You take care of yourself, okay?",
        "Marina: All right.",
        "Josh: I'll see you.",
        "Marina: Bye, Mr. Lewis.",
        "Josh: Bye-bye.",
        "Shayne: All right, tell me every single thing that guy said. I want to hear everything he said.",
        "Marina: I already told you twice!",
        "Shayne: I can't help it. I'm just so like...",
        "Marina: You're excited aren't you?",
        "Shayne: Yes. You know this could be my big break, Marina.",
        "Marina: Could be? It will be. All right, you're going place, Shayne Lewis.",
        "Shayne: Oh, yeah, you think?",
        "Marina: I do.",
        "Shayne: You think?",
        "Marina: You just got to promise me one thing. When you get there you're not going to forget who your real friends are, okay?",
        "Shayne: Never. Never! Never! Never! Never!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: I think the question is, how much pain do you actually want to inflict on Alexandra. Do you want to do it quickly? Or would you prefer to draw it out? Personally I would go for the drawn-out version.",
        "Alan: Spoken like a true Spaulding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Now it all make sense. I had this feeling about Alan last night. Gus really wants to make a connection with him, doesn't he?",
        "Harley: Well, you have to understand when Alan was at his lowest, Gus saw this side of him. And now that seems to be the only thing that Gus sees.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, just wait, because Alan will show his true colors again.",
        "Harley: I am sure he will. Then Gus will be heartbroken.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Alan phoned me last night.",
        "Phillip: Well, what did he say?",
        "Alexandra: Nothing. Nothing. But I could hear him breathing and then he laughed. And then he just hung up.",
        "Phillip: (Sighs)",
        "Alexandra: All right, it was Alan.",
        "Phillip: How do you know that?",
        "Alexandra: I know it. I know his laugh. I just know it.",
        "Phillip: Right. Like you know he jumped in the lake.",
        "Alexandra: All right, Phillip. Alan's out there, he's crazy as a loon and he is coming after me. Well, us. If you want to hide your head in the sand like an ostrich, fine, but I'm not going to play sitting duck.",
        "Phillip: I think you're mixing your metaphors.",
        "Alexandra: I'm going on the offensive, my dear. Now are you with me or not? Oh, fine. Fine. Fine. You're not the only one to have a vested interest in this situation.",
        "Phillip: What does that mean?",
        "Alexandra: Well, I guess you will just have to wait and find out now, won't you?"
