        "Blake meets Cassie while taking a stroll and feels guilty. She tells Cassie about sleeping with Jeffrey. Cassie walks away as Jeffrey and Blake share a photo-op and Jeffrey pats Blake on the behind. Cassie, lurking about, watches this display and leaves in a huff. Frank meets up with Jeffrey and Blake asking Jeffrey if he could compare notes about Ross's plane crash. Blake wonders what all the talk is about as Frank tells her that Ross's female assistant had a female life partner. She realizes that Ross wasn't having an affair and asks Jeffrey how long he knew. Jeffrey doesn't answer her when she asks if it was before he slept with her. Reva wants to be discharged from Cedars and Josh sneaks her home. They share a tender moment kissing and drinking champagne. He gets her back to Cedars and both think they have fooled the nurse. The nurse tells them she knew they were gone. Josh presents Reva with an engagement ring engraved with \"always\" and set with stones to represent the children, including Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan and Coop fight and crash through Company. Coop takes the blame. Coop dotes on Lizzie and makes a meal for her. Lizzie loves the attention. Ashley, Lizzie's friend at the OB-GYN clinic; the one who fixed her medical records, finds her at Company. A startled Lizzie tells Ashley that she cannot go shopping with her today because Coop was injured. Jonathan overhears their conversation and asks Ashley to grab coffee with him, telling her his name is Nate. He proceeds to find out that she works with her uncle-doctor who is an OB-GYN. He asks her for her phone number telling her that they will be spending a lot of time together. Ashley is under the misunderstanding that Jonathan is interested in her for other reasons. Reva is finally given the okay to be released but rubs her left shoulder and looks as if she is in pain. The doctor notices and asks to examine her. As she does, a concerned look comes over her as she asks Reva, \"When was the last time you had a mammogram\"? Reva's face freezes."

        "Cassie: You are all over him.",
        "Blake: What?",
        "Cassie: You're all over Jeffrey. I really think you're going to win this election, Blake.",
        "Blake: Oh. Oh, god, thank you. Come on, let's just get out of here, all right?",
        "Cassie: Why?",
        "Blake: Well...",
        "Cassie: Oh, honey, don't worry about that. I mean his face is plastered all over everywhere. And I run into him all the time.",
        "Blake: Really? And you're okay with that? I mean, it's like you're over with him completely?",
        "Cassie: Hell, no, I'm not over him. Not even close, actually. But I'm... I'm trying. So, I hear that you both are addressing the school board this afternoon.",
        "Blake: Well, yes, we're going to be going over our positions-- on the issues, you know, today.",
        "Cassie: Are you nervous about it?",
        "Blake: No, why?",
        "Cassie: Because you just got all flustered. Honey, you are going to be great. You know what, for the most part, Jeffrey doesn't even like kids. So, all you have to do is express how passionate you are.",
        "Blake: Passion isn't always a good thing, cassie. I mean, especially with me. I get very, very impulsive sometimes.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I know that about you.",
        "Blake: No, and it's not like I trying to hurt anybody or anything. It's just like I ( stammering ) I act first and I think later. Or I don't think, or I don't think at all, which is really, really terrible. Cassie, I have to tell you something. I've got to tell you something, and it's not good.",
        "Cassie: Okay.",
        "Blake: I slept with jeffrey.",
        "Reva: I want out of here.",
        "Josh: This is a very small bed.",
        "Reva: You know what? Maybe they'll spring me tonight. What do you think, if I make a big stink?",
        "Josh: What, you making waves? That would be so unlike you.",
        "Reva: Is that your stomach growling?",
        "Josh: Yes, it is. I'm sorry. It's just my wife was taken away by ambulance to the emergency room, and that seemed more important. I didn't eat.",
        "Reva: Yeah, I know, but I'm okay now. And I don't want you passing out on me. So you go to the cafeteria, and find something to eat, and I'll find the doctor and see if I can make my plea to go home. Home, that sounds so good.",
        "Josh: Yes, it does.",
        "Reva: So what was that big secret you're waiting to tell me about?",
        "Josh: I'm sorry, but you're going to have to wait until you're out of here for good. I can't tell you the secret.",
        "Reva: You and your rules! ( Laughing )",
        "Nurse: Excuse me, sir, you're not supposed to be in the bed with the patient.",
        "Josh: Yes. It was doctor's orders, actually; it's was part of her therapy.",
        "Nurse: It is?",
        "Josh: Yeah, it is. Can I get you one of those rubber sandwiches from the cafeteria?",
        "Reva: No, no, no. I'm fine. I'm going to see about taking care of that little matter we discussed.",
        "Josh: Okay. I'll be back.",
        "Nurse: How you feeling, mrs. Lewis?",
        "Reva: Fabulous.",
        "Nurse: You're pulse is racing.",
        "Reva: I know. ( Laughs ) he does that to me every time.",
        "Jonathan: What happened here, cooper? I couldn't have opened a can of worms. I believe it's common knowledge, right, when that baby was conceived.",
        "Coop: You know what, I just gave up my entire future. Today is not the day to mess with me. Got it?",
        "Jonathan: You hear that sound? That's me shaking in my boots-- or not.",
        "Tammy: I actually think jonathan would make a great dad.",
        "Lizzie: You do? I mean, look how he was raised?",
        "Tammy: That's the whole point, he has learned, you know. Jonathan hates what nate did. He would want to be the best father he could be. And I've seen the way he is with rj, and he's gotten his life together, I know that. I really think he would be a great dad some day. ( Coop yelling ) ( jonathan yells out ) ( glass breaking ) ( tammy and lizzie screaming )",
        "Lizzie: Stop!",
        "Tammy: Stop it!",
        "Lizzie: Stop it!",
        "Tammy: Stop it, you guys, stop it!",
        "Lizzie: Stop it! Stop!",
        "Tammy: Jonathan?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, my gosh, what happened? What did he do to you, you're hurt?",
        "Jonathan: It's okay.",
        "Lizzie: You're hurt.",
        "Coop: It's nothing, all right? It's nothing.",
        "Tammy: What happened?",
        "Coop: Look, sometimes a guy needs to be thrown through a window.",
        "Lizzie: What is your problem?",
        "Jonathan: What is my problem? I was just talking to him! And he threw me through the window!",
        "Coop: Why don't try and--",
        "Tammy: Let go! Stop it, stop it!",
        "Lizzie: Stop!",
        "Tammy: What is going on? What are you fighting about?",
        "Coop: It's about the baby! Captioning sponsored by procter & gamble productions, inc. And cbs jeffrey? My-- with jeffrey o'neill?",
        "Blake: Cassie, I'm sorry. Yes. It was just once. It's not like it was anything. It wasn't even planned or anything--",
        "Cassie: Don't say it. Don't say it. I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear anything because you know what? This really isn't any of my business.",
        "Blake: But it is.",
        "Cassie: We are all adults here, and jeffrey and you are both free to--",
        "Blake: No, no, no. Cassie, please, let me explain because I am the jerk here, all right?",
        "Jeffrey: Hello. Mrs. Marler, are you ready to take on the school board?",
        "Cassie: I have to go.",
        "Blake: Wait a minute. Cassie, cassie!",
        "Jeffrey: What's wrong?",
        "Photographer: Mrs. Marler, mr. O'neill. Hi. Can you give us a preview of your speeches? What would you do to the school system if you were elected?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I'll be happy to answer that for you, drew. As a matter of fact, I believe that ross marler left the school system in pretty darn good shape. But that doesn't mean we can't further reduce class sizes, and that means hiring new teachers, which will be a top priority.",
        "Blake: Especially at the elementary level. And being a mother, I have firsthand knowledge of that. I have three children in the springfield public school system.",
        "Photographer: Can both of you turn this way, please?",
        "Jeffrey: Sure.",
        "Photographer: And closer to each other.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay.",
        "Blake: Oh, dear. It's not like you to take the high road. Are you feeling all right?",
        "Jeffrey: Still milking motherhood for everything it's worth. Well, I guess that's your only qualification for the job, isn't it?",
        "Blake: There's the jeffrey i know so well.",
        "Photographer: A little more this way.",
        "Josh: You're still dressed.",
        "Reva: That nurse has a tongue depressor tuck up your you know what. I swear. She told me I have to wait for the doctor who admitted me, who is on rounds right now, and it could be a while. I was overtired from the trip to paris, and I fainted, big deal. This is such a pain! All I want to do is get out of here. I want to go home. I want to go home with you.",
        "Josh: Okay. Well, if you put it that way. I have an idea.",
        "Tammy: Why would you guys be fighting about lizzie's baby?",
        "Jonathan: Because...",
        "Lizzie: Oh, shut up! Stay out of this! You're going to ruin everything.",
        "Tammy: Ruin what? Would somebody please tell me what's going on?",
        "Jonathan: Oh, great.",
        "Lizzie: There is no problem here, officer, no worries.",
        "Cop: What happened to the window? Oh, don't all speak at once.",
        "Coop: Look, jonathan and i had a little misunderstanding. All right, it's my fault. I threw the first punch.",
        "Tammy: Why?",
        "Jonathan: Oh, come on, he's just trying to show off.",
        "Cop: Oh, you want to press assault charges?",
        "Jonathan: No, honestly, I'm just trying to get the hell out of here. So if you don't mind.",
        "Coop: Look, it was a misunderstanding, that's all.",
        "Lizzie: You're not going to arrest him or anything, are you?",
        "Cop: No, but you're lucky. He could have faced assault charges.",
        "Lizzie: Look, please, don't blame coop. I just found out that I'm pregnant; he's the father. It's been a lot to handle. He had to give up a really great fellowship at oxford, and he's just got a lot on his plate because of me. If anybody is at fault, it's me.",
        "Tammy: Hey, stop dragging me, all right? What happened back there?",
        "Jonathan: Do we have to do it here, or can we do it when we get home?",
        "Tammy: Okay, but I have to tell you, you just ruined what i was trying to tell lizzie.",
        "Jonathan: Which was what?",
        "Tammy: That you're finally getting your act together, and that we'll both be there for her and her baby.",
        "Tammy: So what was that fight about?",
        "Jonathan: I was just a little annoyed.",
        "Tammy: Why? About what?",
        "Jonathan: About coop being coop. He knocks up lizzie, then he puts the moves on ava. Does anyone call him on it? No, everybody just thinks he's mr. Wonderful-- you, too. You were sure that I was the one who threw the first punch, weren't you?",
        "Tammy: Yeah. I'm sorry.",
        "Jonathan: Whatever. It doesn't matter.",
        "Tammy: No, it does. You were really sticking up for lizzie? That's really sweet of you.",
        "Jonathan: No, it's really stupid. You heard her. She said stay out of it. Well, I'm going to, and you should, too. I know you're just trying to be her friend, but lizzie spauling, pregnant or not, is trouble. Here comes your mom. I'm sure you don't want her to see me like this, so I'll just meet you at outskirts later?",
        "Tammy: Okay.",
        "Cassie: I hope he didn't leave because of me.",
        "Tammy: No, never. Hey, are you okay, mom? You look upset.",
        "Cassie: Me? No. I'M... I'm fine.",
        "Tammy: Is it hard for you to see jeffrey around town?",
        "Cassie: Some days more than others.",
        "Tammy: You know what? You're coming with me. Let's go.",
        "Reva: Oh, joshua. ( Sighs )",
        "Josh: Welcome home, mrs. Lewis.",
        "Reva: Oh. You know, all the times we've walked through this door together, why do I suddenly feel like a bride again?",
        "Josh: That's the idea. In fact...",
        "Reva: No, oh! No, no. You have a bad back.",
        "Josh: Yes, that's true. Thank you for reminding me.",
        "Reva: So we'll hold hands.",
        "Josh: Okay, okay. Ready?",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) you know what? If I'm the bride, then that makes you the groom, which means that this is our wedding night.",
        "Josh: Ah, yeah, that's the idea.",
        "Reva: Mmm. Mmm...",
        "Josh: Mmm... hang on one second. Are you sure... are you sure you're all right with this stuff?",
        "Reva: Hell, yes.",
        "Josh: No, I... mmm... ( laughter ) I know you're all right with this. I mean, you're a fugitive from the hospital. Are you sure you're feeling all right?",
        "Reva: No, actually, I'm not. I need a drink. And, of course, you have thought of everything.",
        "Josh: Yes, I have.",
        "Reva: Oh! You did all of this for little old me?",
        "Josh: Well, it wasn't just me. It was also tammy, jonathan, and cassie.",
        "Reva: The three of them?",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Reva: Together?",
        "Josh: We're all trying to make nice, you know? It was all supposed to be a part of your welcome-home gift.",
        "Reva: Some gift.",
        "Josh: Yeah, it was meant to be a surprise, but, of course, you had your own surprise as usual.",
        "Reva: A lot of surprises lately.",
        "Josh: You know, I think I'm okay with that. How about you?",
        "Reva: Bring them on, as long as the one thing I can be sure of is you.",
        "Josh: I've never been more sure of us in my entire life.",
        "Lizzie: Um, I can do something.",
        "Coop: Look, lizzie, don't, don't, okay? You shouldn't even be lifting anything anyways.",
        "Lizzie: I guess you're right. Oh, there's so much to think about when you're pregnant. I mean, especially eating. I'm supposed to be eating for two, and you know how I always forget.",
        "Coop: Yeah. When was the last time you ate again?",
        "Lizzie: Hmm... this morning... yeah, this morning. I had a muffin.",
        "Coop: This... this morning. That's it? Lizzie, you've got to eat more than that. The doctor, he gave you some sort of a list, right?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. It should have been labeled \"foods lizzie hates.\"",
        "Coop: I'll tell you what, I'll make you something. I'll make you a milkshake. I'll get you a burger and a salad. How about that? Is that all right?",
        "Lizzie: You really don't have to?",
        "Coop: Just stay right there, okay?",
        "Lizzie: I am not going anywhere. ( Cell phone ringing ) hello.",
        "Ashlee: Where are you, lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: Who is this?",
        "Ashlee: It'S... it's ashlee.",
        "Lizzie: Who?",
        "Ashlee: Ashlee. Remember me? I fixed those records about your pregnancy at my uncle's clinic. I have been waiting for you at co2 for almost an hour.",
        "Lizzie: You have? Why? Oh, I said I was going to meet you there, didn't I? Was that today?",
        "Ashlee: You forgot?",
        "Lizzie: No, I didn't forget. Of course I didn't forget. Something came up, something important. I was going to call you, and pregnancy brain, um... I need to reschedule.",
        "Ashlee: No, no, lizzie, you can't cancel on me. I... I was really looking forward to this. I took the whole day off from work because you said we'd have lunch together and you would give me a makeover and we'd go shopping. I didn't ask you to do this, lizzie. After what I did, you said you owed me, so I...",
        "Lizzie: Um, what? What? Oh, I can't hear you. It's getting fuzzy. We're breaking up. Hello? I'll call you back later. Okay.",
        "Ashlee: Lizzie... lizzie!",
        "Jonathan: Hey there.",
        "Ashlee: Are you talking to me?",
        "Jonathan: Of course I am. I don't mean to butt in, but were you just talking to lizzie spaulding?",
        "Ashlee: Uh, yeah, why? Do you know her?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. But not only do I know her, i know where she is right now.",
        "Coop: Your burger is on its way. And oh, did you even want a burger or did you want something a little more bland?",
        "Lizzie: Bland? Why?",
        "Coop: Yeah, the morning sickness, right?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, yeah, I get it sometimes, but not today. I feel good. Thank you for being so concerned.",
        "Coop: Oh, please, you don't have to thank me. I mean, it's my kid, too, right? Look, I wanted to thank you, though, for sticking up for me before.",
        "Lizzie: I had to. You've been so stressed out lately, and it's mainly to do with this.",
        "Coop: Yeah, well, jonathan's not exactly helping the situation. I mean, that guy is completely out of control, and, honestly, i don't even know what tammy sees in him.",
        "Lizzie: Can we please not talk about jonathan? Mmm. Mm-hmm. I will have no problem drinking my milk if you keep making these for me. Oh, I almost forgot. Prenatal vitamins. Got to take my horse pills.",
        "Coop: Uh-huh. Tell you what, I'll get you a glass of water.",
        "Lizzie: Thanks.",
        "Coop: Yes. ( Ashlee clears throat )",
        "Lizzie: What are you doing here?",
        "Ashlee: You said you'd call me back. What? I don'T... what's going on?",
        "Lizzie: Okay, look, of course I was going to call you back. Something came up.",
        "Ashlee: What?",
        "Lizzie: Something important.",
        "Ashlee: Why are you trying to blow me off, lizzie? I really thought we could have fun.",
        "Lizzie: We can. Of course we can.",
        "Ashlee: I don't know. Maybe because you don't actually want to be my friend. Maybe because you're just using me because I work at the medical clinic. Kim zimmer, \"inside the light.\" It is embrazoned-- embrazoned?-- Emblazoned in my mind always to where that whenever I'm watching another soap or watching our show, and i hear somebody else, another character say to somebody \"always\" I, like, get angry. I, like, think, \"no, you can't say that, okay?\" Nobody else is allowed to use that phrase \"always\"; that is a josh and reva thing. See reva, wednesday, may 3rd, \"inside the light.\"",
        "Blake: Thank you.",
        "Jeffrey: Thanks again. See you later. Okay, so you need a ride to the school board meeting? My car is right around the corner.",
        "Blake: Oh, your car. You mean the o'neill love mobile? I don't think so. I have my own car.",
        "Jeffrey: Fine, see you there.",
        "Blake: Jeffrey?",
        "Jeffrey: Yes?",
        "Blake: Cassie knows about us. I told her.",
        "Jeffrey: You... why?",
        "Blake: I'm not sure.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, well, there's a good reason.",
        "Blake: I think it's because she's my friend, and it was wrong to keep it from her.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, it's wrong! Was there... is there anyone else you care to announce this to? Why don't we bring the press back over here?",
        "Blake: You want cassie back?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, if I did, it's too late for that now, isn't it? Good job.",
        "Blake: You think I told her so I could have you all to myself, o'neill?",
        "Jeffrey: Who knows?",
        "Blake: Oh, please. You're thinking I want something more out of our little romp?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, sometimes i have that effect on women.",
        "Blake: Oh, well, not with me, darling. Although, I think it's going to make it a lot easier to negotiate terms for next last debate.",
        "Jeffrey: You know what? Maybe it's not such a bad thing that cassie knows.",
        "Blake: Okay, I think it's good that it's out in the open. That way, you know, no matter what, if anything ever were to happen-- I'm not saying it would, but...",
        "Jeffrey: You sure you don't want a ride?",
        "Frank: Oh, good, I'm glad you're both here. Listen, I want to compare notes on ross' case, okay?",
        "Blake: Ross' case?",
        "Frank: I promise you that we are going to figure out who caused ross' plane to crash.",
        "Tammy: Jeffrey and blake?",
        "Cassie: So what? Hey, that's the kind of guy he was when I met him, jumping from one woman to the next. So clearly people don't really change.",
        "Tammy: No, mom. Jeffrey was different when he was with you. You brought out a lot of good in him.",
        "Cassie: And now he's reverting back to type.",
        "Tammy: If I were you, blake's the one I'd be mad at.",
        "Cassie: I'm not mad at anybody. Okay, I'm mad any everybody. But I... I get it. It's grief for blake. Maybe for jeffrey, too. Is it petty of me to say I hope so?",
        "Tammy: Who cares.",
        "Cassie: Well, what about jonathan?",
        "Tammy: What about him?",
        "Cassie: When he lost you, did he revert back to his old, bad self?",
        "Tammy: Not that I know of.",
        "Lizzie: You know, everything isn't about you, ashlee. Did you see that window out there? You do you know why it's boarded up? There was an incident in here and my boyfriend, coop, got hurt.",
        "Ashlee: Was there a bar fight? I mean, is he all right?",
        "Lizzie: I don't know. I mean, he's pretty cut up, and he might have a concussion. Now do you understand why my staying with him was a little more important than shopping with you?",
        "Ashlee: No, no, no, it's okay. I... I didn't mean to be, like, this stalker chick calling you all the time if I'm coming here. But it juts... it just... I used to watch you walking through the hallways through school, and i knew we could be friends.",
        "Lizzie: We can. We are.",
        "Ashlee: Cool. Call me and we'll reschedule?",
        "Jonathan: Hey, there. It's you. My lucky day. Did you find lizzie?",
        "Ashlee: Yeah, but something came up with her. We made plans, though.",
        "Jonathan: Good. Does that mean that you're free now?",
        "Ashlee: Why?",
        "Jonathan: I just thought maybe we could go grab a cup of coffee and get to know each other better, you know. We're both friends of lizzie, I'm sure we can find plenty to talk about. ( Laughs )",
        "Coop: There you are. What were you doing outside?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, I needed some fresh air. I guess I have a bit of the morning sickness after all.",
        "Coop: Oh, right. Do you still want this stuff then?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. I feel much better now.",
        "Josh: You think that after everything I'm going to bail now?",
        "Reva: It's just I thought i heard something in your voice.",
        "Josh: Well, I'm sure that was me being overwhelmed with gratitude that we found our way back to each other. Or maybe it was me being a little nervous, or maybe it was... me being overprotective because I just want to make sure that it really sticks this time. No more trial separations, no more divorce papers, no more car accidents or fainting spells.",
        "Reva: You know the reason i fainted, don't you? Overexcitement! ( Laughs ) because I knew I was going to be seeing you soon, and darn it, you still make me wobbly in the knees and a little light-headed.",
        "Josh: I see. So it's my fault that you fainted?",
        "Reva: Yeah. And actually, you're the only one who can revive me.",
        "Josh: Mmm.",
        "Reva: With a kiss.",
        "Josh: I... hate be to the one to break this up.",
        "Reva: Oh, no.",
        "Josh: I hate it, but the truth is we should think about getting back to the hospital before that nurse reports you as a missing person.",
        "Reva: Yeah, big excitement at cedars.",
        "Josh: Well, think of it this way: The sooner we get back there, the sooner we get back here.",
        "Reva: I like your logic. So this was your big surprise?",
        "Josh: Oh, no, no, no. There's a whole lot more to come.",
        "Lizzie: Mmm. For a baby the size of a peanut, the kid can eat.",
        "Coop: Hmm, well, he takes after his dad.",
        "Lizzie: You said \"his.\" Do you think it's going to be a boy?",
        "Coop: You know what? I don't even care. I just want everything and everyone to be okay. That's it.",
        "Lizzie: If it's a boy, I hope he has your eyes. And if it's a girl, I hope she's nothing like me.",
        "Coop: Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: No, I'm serious, coop. I make such a mess out of everything. I wouldn't blame you if you hated me.",
        "Coop: All right, stop. I don't hate you, all right?",
        "Lizzie: I hate myself sometimes. I'm so scared that I'm not going to be a good mom. I mean, what if I'm not nurturing enough? What if I don't no what the baby wants when its crying?",
        "Coop: Okay, okay, stop, all right. You're going to figure this all out, all right? I'm scared, too, here, but we're going to take it one day at a time, one step at a time, all right? And we will figure this stuff out, but we'll do it together.",
        "Lizzie: Really? You're going to help me and the baby? Look after us?",
        "Coop: Of course I will.",
        "Ashlee: I can't believe you. I mean, I don't even know your name.",
        "Jonathan: Nate. I'm nate. And you are...",
        "Ashlee: Ashlee.",
        "Jonathan: So you were friends with lizzie in high school?",
        "Ashlee: Not exactly. We met while doing a play. You see, she was the lead and i helped with the costumes because I really want to be a fashion designer.",
        "Jonathan: But right now you work in a medical clinic. That's what I heard you say, right?",
        "Ashlee: Yeah, it's my uncle's clinic. He's a doctor.",
        "Jonathan: Cool. What kind of doctor?",
        "Ashlee: An obgyn. Most of his patients are pregnant women.",
        "Blake: I don't understand this. You're telling me ross' plane was sabotaged? How long have you know this?",
        "Frank: Not long, blake. We just started the investigation. Listen, did you find out anything more about nicole anders?",
        "Blake: Ross' slutty assistant?",
        "Frank: You didn't tell her anything, did you?",
        "Jeffrey: It's an investigation, frank.",
        "Blake: What the hell is going on here? What does anything have to do with the woman that ross is having an affair with?",
        "Frank: Well, she was a pi.",
        "Blake: Okay. So what? She was investigating him while she was sleeping with him?",
        "Jeffrey: Actually, we believe that ross hired her to the job.",
        "Frank: Well, did you tell her the other thing about nicole?",
        "Blake: What? There is more?",
        "Frank: Blake, nicole had a partner. Her name was kelsey, okay. And I'm not talking about a business partner here, I'm talking about a life partner. So that pretty much told us that ross didn't sleep with anyone, all right? I mean, that's good news, isn't it? Why do I get the feeling that I've stirred something up here?",
        "Blake: You've got good instincts, frank.",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, right now my instincts are telling me to get out of here, so...",
        "Blake: That's a good idea.",
        "Frank: All right, blake, you hang in there. I'll keep you informed.",
        "Jeffrey: Look, I can explain.",
        "Blake: Okay, go for it. No, wait a minute, let me guess. You knew ross that was not having an affair when he died. When did you find out? Before or after you slept with me? Oh. Oh, my god.",
        "Reva: Wow, that was easy. They didn't even know we were gone.",
        "Nurse: Welcome back.",
        "Reva: Damn.",
        "Nurse: Did you two have a nice little adventure?",
        "Josh: How did you know?",
        "Nurse: You were reading \"model bride\" upside down. Dead giveaway.",
        "Reva: So much for our life of crime.",
        "Josh: Well, actually, I was reading this for a reason. I... let's see, I wanted to make sure I made the right choice. I don't know. For my bride.",
        "Reva: Oh. Oh, joshua! Oh, it's gorgeous. And it's engraved. \"Always.\"",
        "Josh: There's a stone for each one of us, and one for each of the kids, including jonathan. Here. Take this one.",
        "Reva: What made me think i could ever live without you?",
        "Nurse: Still fraternizing? Dr. Gold just got out of surgery. She'll be here to see you shortly.",
        "Reva: Oh, good. Thanks.",
        "Josh: Hang on. I know, I know, I can't take this here. Business call. I'll be right back.",
        "Reva: Thanks.",
        "Josh: Yeah, cassie. Reva's doing fine. I haven't told her yet about cross creek. I'm just waiting for the right moment to spring it on her for maximum effect. I know, she's going to be really happy about it, and the thing about, you know, hb's dream and the hospital and all that. I just... what? How can you possibly tell I'm smiling? We're on the phone.",
        "Reva: \"Always.\" This is it, today's daytime dollars official winning code number. For your chance to win cash and prizes, register at daytimedollars.Com, and keep watching for your chance to win. Good luck.",
        "Blake: You are the lowest of the low, o'neill.",
        "Jeffrey: I was going to tell you. I tried to tell you.",
        "Blake: When? After a couple more romps in the car? You knew I thought ross was cheating on me when he died. That's why I let you do what you did.",
        "Jeffrey: You let me? Wait a minute. You came after me like a heat seeking missile, okay. Not that I minded, but let's be honest here.",
        "Blake: You should have stopped me. What kind of man are you?",
        "Jeffrey: One with a pulse, okay? I told you from the beginning, i am not a gentlemen. And all is fair in love and politics.",
        "Cassie: Thank you for making me talk about the whole jeffrey- blake thing. I can't believe I just said \"the jeffrey-blake thing.\" I was going to say I actually feel better, but you know what? I really don't think I do. But I am really glad, honey we can at least just talk like this again. Just be together.",
        "Tammy: Me, too.",
        "Cassie: And you know, if there's ever anything that you want to talk about, I am here.",
        "Tammy: Okay. Why do I get the idea you're asking me that for a reason?",
        "Cassie: Well, I'm not judging, but I did notice when i saw jonathan earlier, that it looked like he had been in a fight? Hey. Your turn.",
        "Tammy: Okay. Yeah, jonathan was in a fight with coop, but coop started it.",
        "Cassie: Coop started it. Coop? Mellow coop?",
        "Tammy: It's true. Coop admitted it. Yeah, jonathan was just telling coop to do right by lizzie, and coop lost it. Mom, I'm telling you, there's a part of jonathan that you don't even know about. He really goes to bat for the underdog.",
        "Cassie: Since when is lizzie spaulding an underdog?",
        "Tammy: Well... okay, I guess it will be obvious soon enough. Lizzie's pregnant with coop's baby.",
        "Cassie: Oh, lord. I thought lizzie and coop had broken up.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, well, I guess they got back together for a night. That's all it takes is once, right?",
        "Jonathan: Thank you. So most of your uncle's patients are pregnant women?",
        "Ashlee: Yeah, why?",
        "Jonathan: No, just interested, that's all.",
        "Ashlee: Look, we both know why you're so interested in the clinic.",
        "Jonathan: We do?",
        "Ashlee: How did you get those cuts? A fight, I'll bet. So let me guess. You need to see a doctor, but you don't have any insurance, so you're hoping I'll get my uncle to see you for free.",
        "Jonathan: No. No, it's nothing like that. I'm really interested in medicine, and you shouldn't jump to conclusions like that, ashlee. Not everybody is a user like lizzie.",
        "Ashlee: Lizzie's not a user. Okay, maybe she is a little. But she had a good excuse. Her boyfriend got her and she had to take care of him. I mean, after all, he is the father of her child.",
        "Jonathan: So you know about that, too?",
        "Ashlee: Yeah.",
        "Jonathan: I have to run to work, but I'd really like to see you again.",
        "Ashlee: You mean like a date?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Why don't you give me your number so I can call you?",
        "Ashlee: Really?",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) yeah. I promise you, we're going to be seeing a lot of each other.",
        "Coop: I'll tell you what. You wait here, and I'll go get the car.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. Coop, look, I know that all this stuff you're doing it doesn't mean anything for us, but I just want you to know that I really do appreciate it. We were in love with each other at one time, and our baby came from that love. And that's special and important, even if we're not together when the baby is born. Okay, I'm being really mushy. It's hormones, please stop me.",
        "Coop: No, no, lizzie, it's fine. That's okay, all right, don't worry about it.",
        "Lizzie: Baby steps, little one. Baby steps.",
        "Josh: Hey.",
        "Reva: Hi.",
        "Josh: That was a business thing I've got to take care of. So I'm going to do that and then I'll come back.",
        "Reva: Okay. Well, I'll just get the doctor to spring me and then I'll meet you back home.",
        "Josh: You sure about that?",
        "Reva: I am positive and then we can have the rest of our dinner. I'll see you soon.",
        "Josh: All right.",
        "Dr. Gold: Mrs. Lewis?",
        "Reva: Hey.",
        "Dr. Gold: Word is you want to go home?",
        "Reva: Yes, the sooner the better.",
        "Dr. Gold: Well, the lab tests just came back normal. So I think that can be arranged.",
        "Reva: Hallelujah. You have no idea how happy you've just made me.",
        "Dr. Gold: Is your shoulder bothering you?",
        "Reva: Yeah, I had a car accident a while ago, and i think the seat belt did a number on my shoulder. Sometimes hurts...",
        "Dr. Gold: Sit down, let me take a look at it.",
        "Reva: It's really nothing.",
        "Dr. Gold: Any other complaints while we're at it?",
        "Reva: Just tired, jet lag, and the food here sucks.",
        "Dr. Gold: Oh, yeah, this is quite a knot.",
        "Reva: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Dr. Gold: Where is it that your chest hurts?",
        "Reva: You know, like, right around here. I think it was the seat belt probably smashed it or something. The shoulder and the chest hurt sometimes. You know, maybe if you can give me a painkiller or something, or maybe an anti- inflammatory. I've got a big night planned for tonight. What is it, doctor?",
        "Dr. Gold: Reva, when did you have your last mammogram?",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "sponsored by airwick.",
        "Dr. Gold: And you have a soreness in your chest, not to mention the lump that I felt. People have a tendency to get nervous when they hear the word biopsy.",
        "Dr. Mccabe: I've taken over your case, dr. Mccabe.",
        "Reva: Why are you taking over my case."
