        "\r\nJack: I want you to tell me if the secrets you've been keeping for your sister \r\nhave something to do with Cabot! ",
        "\r\nRosanna: Don't walk out, okay? Look, right now, you are more important to me \r\nthan any man has ever been in my entire life. ",
        "\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Edmund: Cassie. Don't worry; Reva will be \r\nhere in a minute. ",
        "Cassie: I just hope it's enough. ",
        "Edmund: Well, if it's not enough, I don't \r\nknow what is. ",
        "Cassie: Thank you so much for coming so \r\nquickly. ",
        "Reva: Has anything changed since you called \r\nme? ",
        "\r\nCassie: No. She's still locked in her room. This is killing me, Reva. I mean, we \r\ntried to be very careful when we brought up Tammy kissing him. ",
        "Reva: She blew up anyway? ",
        "\r\nCassie: Yeah. She tore into us. She was even angry at Edmund for telling me \r\nabout the kiss. ",
        "\r\nReva: Angry at you for reading her journal? You know what, she's just feeling \r\noverwhelmed right now. Why don't we go up there and talk to her? ",
        "Cassie: Okay. ",
        "Reva: Uh, I think maybe you should stay here. \r\nGirl talk might get us further. ",
        "\r\nEdmund: Right, that makes sense. I've got some work to do on festival anyway, so \r\nI'll just stay down here. ",
        "Cassie: I'll let you know the second \r\nsomething changes. ",
        "Edmund: Thanks. ",
        "\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "\r\nJoey: Hey, Oliver, how are you doing? I was supposed to meet Tammy Winslow in \r\nthe outdoor cafe for a study date, but she's not there. Do know if she's in the \r\ndining room? ",
        "Bellhop: I haven't seen her. Perhaps she's up \r\nin her room. ",
        "Joey: Okay, cool. Thanks. ",
        "\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Lizzie: Oh, wait, Joey. You can't do that.\r\n",
        "Bill: Honey, please, please. No more jewelry \r\nstores, okay? ",
        "\r\nEden: Bill, this is important. Harley has gone out of her way to help me with \r\nall the wedding plans, and I want to get her a nice maid of honor gift. \n",
        "\r\nBill: I think that's great. You should do that. \u00a0But, I don't think you need me \r\nfor that. So, I'm just going to go down to the... ",
        "Eden: You know, I thought you liked all this \r\nstuff. ",
        "Bill: Yeah, sure... almost all of it. \n",
        "Eden: To tell you the truth, I need your \r\nhelp. I've never bought a gift for a woman before. ",
        "Bill: Seriously? ",
        "Eden: Seriously. ",
        "\r\nBill: All right, well, then you know what? We're going to have to look at this \r\nfrom a whole new direction. Okay, think Harley. Harley... ",
        "Eden: Harley? ",
        "\r\nBill: Yes. How about the gift certificates for CDs, you know, electronics, \r\nsomething in that realm. ",
        "Eden: Even I know that's wrong. ",
        "Bill: Really? Because that\u2019s... ",
        "Eden: You are no help either. ",
        "Bill: I don't know. That's cool though.\r\n",
        "Eden: No, it's not. ",
        "\r\nBill: You see, this is why Michelle would always help me pick out gifts, you \r\nknow, and I'd just sign the card. And that\u2019s... ",
        "Eden: Oh, Michelle picked out your gifts, \r\nhuh? ",
        "Bill: I confess. ",
        "Eden: Really? Oh, all of them? ",
        "Bill: Not this one. This one was me. I mean, \r\ncome on, that's straight from the heart. ",
        "Eden: You know, I wish Michelle was here \r\nright now. ",
        "\r\nBill: Well, in that case, may I be excused? I've got to go to the office, \r\nbecause I have so much to do. ",
        "Eden: No, I need you. Please, don't disappear \r\non me. ",
        "Bill: Disappear, huh? ",
        "Eden: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Bill: Not a chance. ",
        "Eden: You're so cute. ",
        "\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "\r\nMichelle: So, I should just disappear, huh? I'm supposed to grab Robbie, hop on \r\na plane to... oh, London, while Danny\u2019s in the middle of his meeting in New \r\nYork? ",
        "\r\nDanny: Yeah, that's right. No one said it was going to be easy, Michelle. \r\nConsider the alternative. ",
        "Michelle: You mean, loyalty? ",
        "\r\nJeffrey: You're so gung-ho on protecting Danny and staying by his side. You're \r\ncompletely ignoring how dangerous you are to him right now. ",
        "Michelle: I'm not going to let Danny face \r\nthis alone. ",
        "\r\nJeffrey: Well, that's not common sense, Michelle, okay? That's your pride \r\ntalking. You and Robbie should leave right now. This way two people will be \r\nsafe, you and your little boy. \u00a0Danny will be a hell of a lot better off. \n",
        "Michelle: While Danny is left in Springfield \r\nwith nobody he can depend on?! ",
        "\r\nJeffrey: Depend on to do what? To help him? I thought we'd been through this \r\nalready. If the mob gets suspicious of Danny, and decide to put the squeeze on \r\nyou, what do you think they are going to do, Michelle? What are you going to do? \r\nWhat did you agree to do? Are you going to give him up? It doesn't have to come \r\nto that if you want to help Danny get out of town. ",
        "\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Tony: Danny, get on a plane. ",
        "Danny: Yep. ",
        "Tony: Get on a plane. Go home to Michelle and \r\nRobbie. ",
        "Danny: Tony, get off it. I told you, I'm late \r\nfor a meeting inside. Do you mind? ",
        "\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Salerno: Is there a problem, gentlemen?\r\n",
        "\r\nDanny: Yeah, actually there is, Vinnie. Your associate here seems to think I'm \r\ncrashing your party. Tell him I'm an invited guest. ",
        "Salerno: Looks like you're having a little \r\ntrouble convincing him yourself. ",
        "\r\nDanny: Well, I've spent a lot of time lately being an upright citizen. He didn't \r\nbuy that I have some business with you. I guess I wouldn't buy it myself. \n",
        "Salerno: Is that all it was? ",
        "Tony: Yeah, that's right. ",
        "\r\nSalerno: I did invite Danny. He asked if he could address the group. Surprised \r\nto see Tony working for me, Danny? ",
        "\r\nDanny: To be honest with you, Vinnie, there's not a whole hell of a lot that \r\nsurprises me anymore. ",
        "Salerno: Cool as ever, aren't you, huh? I \r\nlike that. Come on. Everybody's waiting. ",
        "\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "\r\nSalerno: As I told you, our old friend here requested a meeting. Exactly why he \r\ndidn't say, I think he wants something from me. You're here to bear witness and \r\ncounsel me if need be. Go ahead, Danny, the floor is yours. ",
        "\r\nDanny: All right. First, I want to thank all of you for agreeing to meet with \r\nme. All right, here it is. I've made some mistakes, one of them being not \r\nknowing my place. I reached too high and got slapped for it. ",
        "\r\nSalerno: In other words, you tried to buy that election, and you got caught. Now \r\nyou're taking the hit. ",
        "\r\nDanny: Yeah, well, it doesn't matter, Vinnie. I'm out. The other guy is in. \r\nNothing is going to change that. ",
        "Oscar: Yeah, well, how come you're not in \r\njail if things happened? ",
        "\r\nDanny: Because they can't lock me up for rumors they can't prove. As much of \r\nthat smug sob of a D.A. Jeffrey O'Neill wants me on ice; it's not going to \r\nhappen. I guarantee you that. ",
        "\r\nSalerno: Look, Danny, I like you, okay? But let's not mince words. You wanted \r\nthis shiny new life of yours. We're the nasty past you turned your back on. So \r\nlet me ask you what everybody here is thinking: Why are you back here talking to \r\nus? ",
        "\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Michelle: Nice speech. But I'm not leaving.\r\n",
        "Jeffrey: You've got a death wish, don't you?\r\n",
        "\r\nMichelle: You know what? I'm not fooling myself. I know the odds Danny\u2019s facing. \r\nBut I also know his odds are a lot better with me by his side. ",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, really? The whole is greater \r\nthan the sum of its parts? Is that it? ",
        "Michelle: That's it. ",
        "\r\nJeffrey: There's another part you're forgetting about, Michelle. You've got a \r\nson to consider. ",
        "\r\nMichelle: No, maybe you should have considered that before you put Danny into \r\nthis position. You know, it's not the mob that's put Danny, Robbie and me at \r\nrisk. You did. ",
        "Jeffrey: You don't have to be at risk. This \r\nis what I'm trying to tell you. ",
        "\r\nMichelle: Oh, this all well and easy for you to say, sitting behind your little \r\ndesk pushing plane tickets, while Danny\u2019s going it alone in Queens. ",
        "Jeffrey: I'm trying to help you. ",
        "\r\nMichelle: Then try to understand. You think I like always looking over my \r\nshoulder, worrying about my son? Of course I don\u2019t. I just know that if I'm \r\naround to support him, he'll have a much better chance of getting through this, \r\njust like Robbie will have a better chance of growing up and knowing his father.\r\n",
        "Jeffrey: These are the only guarantee that \r\nthat will happen. ",
        "\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Edmund: I'm expecting a call from San \r\nCristobel. Has it come in yet? ",
        "Bellhop: Not that I know of, Sir. ",
        "Edmund: All right. Let me know the minute it \r\ndoes, all right? ",
        "Bellhop: Of course. ",
        "Edmund: Thank you. ",
        "\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "\r\nLizzie: Okay, look, Tammy told me to meet you guys here to study, and I cannot \r\nfind her anywhere. I went to her room, she's not there. So, maybe you can go get \r\nus some sodas and I'll call her and try and find her. Sounds good? ",
        "Joey: Okay, cool. ",
        "Lizzie: All right. (Phone rings) ",
        "Tammy: Lizzie? ",
        "\r\nLizzie: Hey, I heard you and your mom got in, like, this huge fight and you \r\nlocked yourself in your room. Is that true? ",
        "Tammy: What did she do? Go on the news or \r\nsomething? ",
        "\r\nLizzie: No, no. Relax. I wasn't even supposed to hear. I just overheard a \r\nhighlight. That is so awesome, girl. ",
        "\r\nTammy: Lizzie, I'm alone in my room with the door locked, and I haven't eaten \r\nall day. This doesn't exactly feel like a victory to me. ",
        "\r\nLizzie: Well, trust me, it is, okay? You can guilt them to death with this but, \r\njust don't leave your room. ",
        "Tammy: But... ",
        "Lizzie: \u2026..Don't worry about that whole food \r\nthing. I'll be right up. I'll take care of it. ",
        "Tammy: No, Lizzie, I... Lizzie? ",
        "\r\nLizzie: Hi, excuse me. Do you think maybe you could run down to the mini mart \r\nfor me and get as much junk food as you possibly can and bring it back here?\r\n",
        "\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Bellhop: Sure. ",
        "Lizzie: Oh, maybe you could get something to \r\ngo from the restaurant, too? ",
        "Bellhop: Right away, miss. ",
        "Lizzie: Thanks. ",
        "\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Reva: So she really let you have it, huh?\r\n",
        "\r\nCassie: Yeah. She was mostly embarrassed, but I've never seen Tammy this angry.\r\n",
        "Reva: Well, maybe she won't be so embarrassed \r\ntalking to me about it. ",
        "Cassie: That's why I called you. ",
        "Reva: Let's give it a try. ",
        "Tammy: I can hear you whispering out there, \r\nyou know, whoever you are. ",
        "Reva: Tammy, honey? It's your Aunt Riva. I \r\nwas kind of hoping we could talk. ",
        "\r\nTammy: Yeah, with mom standing there maybe feeding you what to say to me. I \r\ndon't think so. ",
        "Reva: Tammy, honey... ",
        "Tammy: Go away. ",
        "\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Tammy: You're still there, aren't you? \n",
        "Reva: Yeah, I am. But your mom is leaving. \r\nOkay, we're alone now. ",
        "Tammy: Am I supposed to believe that?",
        "Reva: Tammy, open the door and find out for \r\nyourself. ",
        "\r\nTammy: Forget it. You'll probably throw a log down or something so I can't close \r\nthe door again. ",
        "Reva: You know that's not a bad idea. \n",
        "Tammy: I'm glad you think this is so funny.\r\n",
        "\r\nReva: I don't, honey. I'm just trying to lighten the mood. I was hoping we could \r\ntalk without the door between us. ",
        "Tammy: I don't want to see anybody, or talk.\r\n",
        "\r\nReva: Oh, boy, this really has gotten out of hand. Tammy, what happened was a \r\nbig misunderstanding. Your mother and Edmund... ",
        "\r\nTammy: Look, I said I don't want to talk. Oh, I can't believe she called you. \r\nWho else did she tell\u2026\u2026 Everybody? ",
        "Reva: No, she only told me because I'm \r\nfamily. ",
        "Tammy: Family is the reason that I'm in here. \r\nI wish I didn't have a family. ",
        "Reva: You don't mean that. ",
        "Tammy: Yes, I do. ",
        "Reva: Speaking of family, did I ever tell you \r\nthe story about Marah and new ground? ",
        "Tammy: New what? ",
        "\r\nReva: New ground. It was a band that Marah was really into a couple years back. \r\nAnyway, they were playing a concert in Chicago, and Marah wanted to go to it, \r\nbut I told she couldn't, because she was too young. Well, she took upon herself \r\nto go to it anyway with Tony and Susan and the whole gang, and when she got \r\nback, I punished her. Well, of course, she told me that I was cruel and unfair, \r\nand that I was a terrible, rotten mother, and this went on for days, until the \r\nwhole issue just magnified into everything that was wrong between Marah and me. \r\nAnd the whole thing started because a band was playing in Chicago and not here.\r\n",
        "Tammy: So how did it end? ",
        "\r\nReva: Two weeks later, everything was 100% back to normal. Marah had already \r\npicked a new band to be in love with. ",
        "\r\nTammy: Oh, please, and I'm supposed to draw some kind of parallel here? To think \r\nthat in a week or two, I'll just forget about everything that my mom and her \r\nboyfriend just did to me? ",
        "Reva: Tammy... ",
        "\r\nTammy: I can't believe you would try to compare total betrayal with some \r\nflavor-of- the-month rock band. ",
        "\r\nReva: Tammy, I'm not trying to minimize how painful this has been for you. I \r\nknow that your mother and Edmund hurt your feelings. But what I'm trying to say \r\nis that feelings change. If I've insulted you in anyway, sweetheart, I am sorry, \r\nbut talk to me, please. Open the door and let's talk. ",
        "\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Joey: I got the sodas. ",
        "Lizzie: Oh, well, we don't need those \r\nanymore. Let's go. We have to go to company. ",
        "Joey: Company? ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, that's where Tammy is. \n",
        "Joey: What is she doing there? ",
        "Lizzie: Waiting for us. ",
        "Joey: Right. But she said she was going to \r\nmeet me here. ",
        "\r\nLizzie: You know how girls are. They change their mind all the time. They expect \r\nyou to know exactly what they're thinking. ",
        "Joey: Yeah, I know that. ",
        "\r\nLizzie: Okay. So you and I and Tammy are going to meet at company, and we're \r\ngoing to get this trig out of the way. ",
        "Joey: All right, cool. Let's go. ",
        "\r\nLizzie: Oh, wait. I can't go just yet. My mom is around here somewhere, and I've \r\ngot to find her and let her know what's up. But, you know what? Don't wait for \r\nme. Go ahead. Tammy's going to wonder what has happened to you. I'll be as quick \r\nas I can. ",
        "Joey: All right. And I'm going to save the \r\nreally hard problems just for you. ",
        "\r\nLizzie: You do that. What an awesome guy. Okay, one down, one to go. Where's \r\nthat bellman at? ",
        "\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "\r\nEdmund: I was told my call from San Cristobel has come in. Thank you. Edmund \r\nWinslow speaking. Well, that's completely unacceptable. Look, we had a deal. The \r\nshipment must arrive on time, or the entire thing is blown apart. No. People are \r\ngetting really tired of waiting. You have a job to do. Do it. ",
        "Jeffrey: Trouble? ",
        "Edmund: Nothing I can't handle, Mr. O\u2019Neill. \r\n(Laughter) ",
        "\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Harley: I can't believe that about Rick.\r\n",
        "Mel: Hey. ",
        "Harley: Hi. Hey, this is Monday, right?\r\n",
        "Mel: Yeah, unless they skipped it this week.\r\n",
        "Harley: What are you doing here? You don't \r\nwork this shift, do you? ",
        "Michelle: No? Oh, what was I thinking? \n",
        "Harley: You okay? ",
        "Michelle: Yeah, I'm fine. The phones have \r\nactually been pretty quiet. ",
        "Harley: How's Danny? ",
        "Michelle: Oh, he's fine. He's fine. Robbie \r\nand his two pet turtles are fine, too. ",
        "Mel: Everything okay at home? ",
        "Michelle: Yeah, why wouldn't it be? \n",
        "Mel: I'm just asking. ",
        "Michelle: Right. ",
        "Mel: Michelle, I don't mean to pry, but I'm \r\njust following up. ",
        "\r\nMichelle: Oh, you mean because of my one-night pit stop at the house last week. \r\nYeah, yeah. ",
        "\r\nMel: Well, we haven't talked to each other since then. You can't blame me for \r\nbeing concerned. You were pretty upset that night. ",
        "Michelle: Well, you know, I didn't come back \r\nthe following night. I went back home. ",
        "Harley: What's been going on? ",
        "Michelle: Nothing, really. I mean, it was one \r\nnight. It's no big deal. It's totally over. ",
        "\r\nHarley: Good. Listen, there's no reason for you to hang out if you don't want to \r\nhang out. I mean, we don't need three people to work the phones. ",
        "Michelle: No, I don't mind staying. \n",
        "Harley: Don't worry about it. If you and \r\nDanny have to go somewhere... ",
        "Michelle: I said I'll stay. I mean, I feel \r\nlike making a contribution, you know. Runs in the family, right? ",
        "Mel: Uh-huh. ",
        "\r\nMichelle: Oh, come on, you guys, it's not that foreign of a concept to you. I \r\nmean, that's why we all work here at the hotline, isn't it, to make a \r\ndifference? I just feel like I need to fill my time constructively right now. I \r\nmean, God knows there are a lot of people out there with problems. And wouldn't \r\nit be great if we could make some of those problems go away? ",
        "\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "\r\nSalerno: It seems to me you've been a little mixed up about what you wanted, \r\nDanny. One day, it's the legitimate world; the next day, it's ours. You're the \r\ncomplete opposite of your cousin Tony here. He's always known who he is, and who \r\nhe belongs with. ",
        "\r\nDanny: I know who I am, Vinnie. I just... I got confused. All right, I tried to \r\nchange my life. I thought that there was something else out there for me. \n",
        "Salerno: Something better than the family \r\nbusiness? ",
        "\r\nDanny: Yeah, yeah. I was wrong, okay? I was wrong. That's why I'm here. All I \r\nwant now is to come home. ",
        "Salerno: If you can find one. ",
        "\r\nDanny: Well, I'm hoping that you would help me out with that. Vinnie, you've \r\ndone damn well by me. Everybody in this room has. Each one of you got a nice \r\nchunk of the Santos interest when I pulled my family out of the business. \n",
        "Stan: Are you saying you want your end of the \r\nbusiness back? ",
        "\r\nDanny: No, no, no. I know I can't do that. What's yours now is yours. I screwed \r\nup, and I am more than willing to pay for that mistake. ",
        "Salerno: So, then what do you want to do?\r\n",
        "Danny: I want a chance to prove myself again.\r\n",
        "Salerno: In other words, you need a job.\r\n",
        "\r\nDanny: Yeah, I need a job. I've got a family to support again, Vinnie. I am \r\nformally requesting an opportunity to work for your organization, not on my \r\nterms, but on yours. I will do anything, whatever you want me to do, anything at \r\nall. I just want to come back.

        "\r\nLizzie: Yeah, but you're her mom, and Reva's her aunt. I'm her friend. At least \r\nI'm her age, and I can relate to her. You guys haven't had parental torture in, \r\nlike, decades. ",
