        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Reva: We just got back from aspen.",
        "Josh: So we'll extend our vacation by a few weeks.",
        "Reva: Until when? Retirement? Stop trying to slow us down.",
        "Josh: I'm not talking about slowing us down, reva. I'm talking about taking time to enjoy each other more.",
        "Reva: Can't you enjoy me right here at home? You know, I've got a show to do. I've got, like, all these new ideas I'm pitching my new producer.",
        "Josh: Forget about the show, okay? Think about it. White sands, dinner, dancing.",
        "Reva: You know what? You know what? This producer is barely out of high school. She has no patience.",
        "Josh: This is not about work, is it? This is about reva. This is about taking the \"I need to be needed by my children\" thing to the extreme.",
        "Reva: I don't want to be needed. I'm already needed. And so are you, at work. Wish me luck with my pitch.",
        "Josh: I wish I could get you to forget about work.",
        "Reva: Well, I may give you that shot when we both get home later tonight. ( Squeals ) ( laughter )",
        "Jonathan: Yes. Yes.",
        "Lizzie: Hey, jb. Oh, sorry, jonathan. So, you here for my party?",
        "Jonathan: Was I invited?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. I sent out a lot of invitations. I just figured... never mind. Did that guy ever find you?",
        "Jonathan: What guy?",
        "Lizzie: I don't know. Some guy a couple of days ago.",
        "Jonathan: Well, what did he look like?",
        "Lizzie: I don't remember.",
        "Jonathan: Well, how old was he?",
        "Lizzie: Well, I don't know. He was older than us, but definitely younger than my granddad.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, come on. You can do better than that. Think!",
        "Lizzie: What are you...?",
        "Jonathan: Think.",
        "Lizzie: Are you going to shake it out of me now? Thank you.",
        "Coop: Well... what's going on here?",
        "Lizzie: I'm having a party for my friends.",
        "Coop: ( Laughs ) yeah, it's pretty jumping, actually.",
        "Sandy: Tammy? Hi. I just got your message. What's wrong?",
        "Tammy: What's wrong is that you have been working too much.",
        "Sandy: Hm.",
        "Tammy: I decided that you needed a day off.",
        "Sandy: Ah. You decided? You're not exactly the boss.",
        "Tammy: Well, I'm family. That has to count for something, right? Come on. Here, have a strawberry. Are you mad?",
        "Sandy: I'm furious. ( Laughs ) here's a beautiful day, you're the most beautiful girl in the world, and I am stuck here with you. It couldn't get any worse.",
        "Tammy: No, wait.",
        "Sandy: Hm?",
        "Tammy: I have to tell you the truth. I set you up.",
        "Edmund: Alonzo, just listen to me. All right? Do not call cassie. She's far too emotional right now. I will persuade her to hand will over to you. You just need to give me more time. All right? All right. All right, good. I'll be in touch. Cassie?",
        "Cassie: I just got off the phone with the american consulate. They referred me to three different lawyers who gave me three different versions of the custody law.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, alonzo will not take will. I'll make him see reason. I just need a little more time. You can depend on me.",
        "Cassie: Richard and I agreed that will would be schooled in san cristobel. But this is just too soon. It's so soon.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, just... just leave alonzo to me, all right? I will, I'll take care of everything.",
        "Cassie: I'm so glad you're here. We all have it. But what if we were all made to face it, you know? And I'm not just talking about eating worms or getting locked in a cage with bats. I'm talking real phobias, things that cripple people's lives. We hire a psychologist and we profile one guest each week. And it culminates with he or she being forced to confront their biggest fear, like taking a ride in that elevator or parachuting out of an airplane, and I'm right there for the ride, you know? Hang-gliding, bungee jumping, being buried alive.",
        "Stephanie: Reva, it's totally cool the way you came to this meeting so prepared.",
        "Reva: Thank you.",
        "Stephanie: I mean, it's so professional. You seem really buzzed about the whole thing.",
        "Reva: I am so buzzed. ( Laughs ) I am so looking forward to working with...",
        "Stephanie: I don't want to be a buzz kill, but I have some bad news. We're going to have to-- I don't really know how to tell you this-- let you go. We've decided to take your show in a new direction.",
        "Edmund: Trust me, cassie. Alonzo is way out of his league. I'm going to expose his cruelty. I'm going to make him sorry he ever tried to lay claim to your son.",
        "Cassie: Alonzo is not cruel, and he never has been. I'm going to call him myself and I'm going to handle this.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, cassie, cassie, cassie.",
        "Cassie: Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Let me take care of this. I have a good relationship with him. I can handle it. Really. That's why you wanted me to stay, isn't it? ( Cell phone ringing )",
        "Cassie: That's my cell. It might be the american consulate.",
        "Edmund: Right. ( Knocking on door ) well, dinah. How was your day trip to san cristobel?",
        "Dinah: Good. Full of surprises, the main one being the fact that you never got on the plane.",
        "Edmund: Well, I'm sorry about that, but I had no idea you were joining me. How's the baby?",
        "Dinah: The baby is good. The baby is good. I'm actually glad that you decided to stay in town. I need you here. What exactly changed your mind?",
        "Cassie: Dinah. How was the spa?",
        "Dinah: It was good. It was very relaxing, actually.",
        "Cassie: I missed the call.",
        "Edmund: Well, I'm sure it wasn't about will, anyway.",
        "Dinah: What, will?",
        "Cassie: His biological father wants custody.",
        "Dinah: Why? What's the big deal? You guys legally adopted him. It wasn't legal?",
        "Cassie: Of course it was legal, okay? It's just complicated.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, you don't have to explain yourself to dinah. The only important thing to remember is we're going to fight and we're going to win. That's it.",
        "Dinah: So this is a royal thing?",
        "Edmund: Will belongs here, with this family. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Cassie: Excuse me. Hello?",
        "Dinah: Very nice.",
        "Cassie: Yes, this is cassie.",
        "Dinah: Very nice. Very convenient for you, prince charming.",
        "Cassie: No, you can't do this to us. Yes, I understand that, okay? I understand that, but what you are asking is impossible. Hello? No. Hello!",
        "Edmund: Cassie, cassie, what's going on?",
        "Cassie: That was a representative for alonzo. He said that will has to be in san cristobel in two weeks.",
        "Tammy: You know I think you're the hottest guy on the planet, right?",
        "Sandy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Tammy: You're cute, you're funny. You are the perfect candidate for this. It's no big deal. It'll just take 20 minutes, max.",
        "Sandy: Okay, I must admit my imagination... running wild.",
        "Tammy: Get your mind out of the gutter. This is a medical experiment.",
        "Sandy: We're going to play doctor. Okay, okay, still in the gutter.",
        "Tammy: It's for my psych class. I'm supposed to ask you some questions about your background and then do an analysis.",
        "Sandy: Okay. That'S... that's disappointing. ( Sighs )",
        "Tammy: It's fine. It's easy. Ready? Okay. Okay, so hi.",
        "Sandy: Hi.",
        "Tammy: So, you're sandy foster.",
        "Sandy: That's me.",
        "Tammy: Where did you grow up, sandy?",
        "Sandy: Have I really grown up?",
        "Tammy: Good question. How old are you?",
        "Sandy: 64. I look good, right?",
        "Tammy: ( Sigh ) do you have any brothers or sisters?",
        "Sandy: Um... okay, six brothers. Doc, dopey, grumpy, sneezy...",
        "Tammy: What was your earliest childhood memory?",
        "Sandy: Tammy, I don't even remember lunch yesterday.",
        "Tammy: What was your happiest childhood memory?",
        "Sandy: Do you know how cute you look right now?",
        "Tammy: Would you stop? I have to show this to my class.",
        "Sandy: Well, hello, class. Is she gorgeous or what?",
        "Tammy: Are you going to help me or not?",
        "Sandy: I just... I'm sorry. It'S... you're making me nervous. I can't focus. How about I ask the questions?",
        "Tammy: Uh-uh, uh-uh.",
        "Sandy: Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? First question: How does it feel to be as attractive as you?",
        "Tammy: Give it back.",
        "Sandy: Uh-uh.",
        "Tammy: You're impossible.",
        "Sandy: I think I have my diagnosis. Now it's time for my experiment.",
        "Coop: I think the party's getting a little too wild. You might want to keep it down. Otherwise the springfield pd might come in and shut it all down.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, you're so funny. They're being fashionably late, which you would know nothing about. What are you doing here in the first place?",
        "Coop: Well, I just came to get my letter of recommendation.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, no offense, but you suck as a waiter.",
        "Coop: Yeah, that I know, and actually, you suck as a party planner, apparently?",
        "Lizzie: You know what? If you're going to act like that, then just...",
        "Coop: Like what?",
        "Lizzie: Like you. You know what? Go. My friends are going to be here in a few minutes. I don't need you here.",
        "Blake: So, thanks for returning my phone calls.",
        "Sebastian: Oh, chrissie. I'm sorry, I was going to call.",
        "Blake: Yeah, yeah. Right, right, right, right.",
        "Sebastian: I was.",
        "Blake: So listen, I just want to know what happened with alan. Did our little act pan out?",
        "Sebastian: Like a dream. You're looking at alan's go-to guy.",
        "Blake: He trusts you?",
        "Sebastian: Yeah. He's very vulnerable right now. Gus is mia and guess who's been put on the search and rescue?",
        "Blake: Gus is missing?",
        "Sebastian: Yeah. He's probably just taking a break from the old man, which is something I'm probably going to need pretty soon.",
        "Blake: You should put me on the case, you know? I'm a fabulous pi.",
        "Sebastian: Uh, no, I'm doing just fine by myself.",
        "Blake: Oh, come on. I'd be your secret weapon. Think how happy dad would be if he knew we were working together, you know?",
        "Sebastian: Well, I can't argue with that.",
        "Blake: Actually, you'll find that arguing with me is a huge waste of time.",
        "Sebastian: ( Laughs )",
        "Blake: Besides, I already have an idea of how I can help you.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, joshua. You weren't at the office today.",
        "Josh: No, I wasn't, but you were.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. I didn't get to finish that project you gave me because the phone kept ringing off the hook.",
        "Josh: That happens sometimes.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, it's no big deal, though. I'm going to bring it home with me, get it done.",
        "Josh: ( Laughs )",
        "Jonathan: Why are you laughing like that?",
        "Josh: I... you're taking this job very seriously, aren't you?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. I want you to know that I don't just go around trying to hurt people all day. I mean, it's not like the only thing I do, you know? There are people like that, but I'm not.",
        "Reva: Whose idea was it to drop my contract?",
        "Stephanie: It came from the top.",
        "Reva: Alan. Didn't even have the guts to fire me himself.",
        "Stephanie: Reva, don't take it personally. It's a numbers game, and yours were down.",
        "Reva: Not the last time i looked.",
        "Stephanie: The household ratings were consistent, but you know how it goes. The group that really counts is 18 to 49.",
        "Reva: So I'm being fired for a younger person.",
        "Stephanie: You've had a nice long run.",
        "Reva: Admit it. You're replacing me with a younger face.",
        "Stephanie: No. A different face. A new direction. Talk shows change their focus all the time.",
        "Reva: How would you know? You've been with us for, what, six weeks? When do you want me out?",
        "Stephanie: I brought this. It's your severance check. I thought I'd save you the trouble of having to come pick it up.",
        "Reva: Thanks, steph. You're so very thoughtful.",
        "Stephanie: It's been really great working with you. You should stop in and say hi.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) ooh. ( Sighs ) ( telephone rings )",
        "Jonathan: Hello?",
        "Reva: What are you doing?",
        "Jonathan: Working. How about that, huh?",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) well, bag it. We need to raise some hell.",
        "Edmund: It's decaf.",
        "Cassie: Look who's up from their nap.",
        "Edmund: Will. Hey, what's wrong, buddy?",
        "Cassie: He had a bad dream. Didn't you? He said that a monster was after him, was trying to catch him and that he couldn't find us and he was lost.",
        "Edmund: Oh, no. A monster. Well, you know what we should do? We should draw a picture of that monster. We should rip it into a million- zillion pieces and throw it away. What do you think? We'll banish him forever.",
        "Cassie: That sound good to you? Yeah? I'll never, ever let a monster take you away from me. Come on.",
        "Edmund: Come on.",
        "Dinah: You'll always be first with me, baby. Don't worry.",
        "Cassie: Now, don't make it too scary, okay? I don't want to have a hard time going to sleep. I'm so lucky to have you.",
        "Edmund: Cassie? I don't think your luck is ever going to run out, but if by chance we should lose in court and you have to relinquish will, we can always move to san cristobel.",
        "Cassie: San cristobel.",
        "Edmund: San cristobel or some other place where alonzo can never find us.",
        "Tammy: Sandy?",
        "Sandy: Yes?",
        "Tammy: Your break's over. Time to get back to the interview and get serious.",
        "Sandy: I'm always serious.",
        "Tammy: There's something wrong. It's not working.",
        "Sandy: Maybe that's a sign that we should get back to...",
        "Tammy: Hey! The tape's missing.",
        "Sandy: You forgot the tape?",
        "Tammy: Hand it over.",
        "Sandy: I don't have it.",
        "Tammy: Do I need to frisk you?",
        "Sandy: Go right head.",
        "Tammy: ( Laughs ) okay, maybe not. ( Clears throat )",
        "Sandy: Where did that come from? Do you believe in poltergeists?",
        "Tammy: You know what? From now on, I will be asking the questions. Let's start with your parents. Who were you closer to, your mother or your father?",
        "Sandy: Tammy, I don't like talking about myself.",
        "Tammy: Were they happy?",
        "Sandy: Who knows?",
        "Tammy: How long have they been married?",
        "Sandy: Shut it off.",
        "Tammy: Sandy, I just need a thumbnail sketch.",
        "Sandy: Then ask reva or josh, or billy. Marina.",
        "Tammy: I want you.",
        "Sandy: I have nothing to say. Come on. Let's go.",
        "Josh: Hey, coop.",
        "Coop: Josh.",
        "Josh: Heading in to work?",
        "Coop: Um...",
        "Blake: Hey, josh? Do you have a minute?",
        "Josh: Yeah, sure.",
        "Coop: Guys, excuse me for just one second? I really need your help.",
        "Josh: What kind of help?",
        "Coop: Well, lizzie's trying to throw a party and I need to round up some guests.",
        "Blake: Us?",
        "Josh: ( Laughs )",
        "Coop: Yeah. You, anybody her own age. I mean, look, anybody that can... well, that's frankly brave enough to withstand a spaulding event.",
        "Josh: What about her real friends?",
        "Coop: That's the thing. I don't think she has too many friends. And I know this is last minute and this is going to be asking a lot, but ever since her dad died, I mean she's been... she's just been hurting a lot and I... look, just help out if you can. If you want to, it would be greatly appreciated, okay?",
        "Sebastian: Well, lizzie is a spaulding.",
        "Blake: I suppose it couldn't hurt, huh?",
        "Sebastian: Mm-hmm.",
        "Blake: Technically she's ross's niece, which makes her family.",
        "Josh: Great. Sounds like you two have it under control. I'll see you around.",
        "Blake: Wait a minute. Josh? We may have a proposition for you.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, there.",
        "Reva: Hey, kid. ( Laughter ) what are you drinking?",
        "Jonathan: Actually, I'm working. I have to get back to the office or joshua will kill me.",
        "Reva: You know something? I own a big chunk of that company, and I say take the rest of the day off.",
        "Jonathan: Why? What's going on?",
        "Reva: I just need a buddy, that's what's going on.",
        "Jonathan: Well, I can't believe I'm saying this, but i actually have work to do.",
        "Reva: You need to loosen up, jonathan. You're growing old before your time. My son needs a drink! Yoo-hoo! ( Laughs ) what?",
        "Jonathan: You're wearing me down.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs )",
        "Jonathan: Okay, I'll have a drink.",
        "Reva: I knew it. ( Laughter )",
        "Jonathan: Why don't you get me an iv, too. And drinks for everybody.",
        "Reva: And music. Come on.",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs )",
        "Reva: It would be a big mistake to cross me today.",
        "Stephanie: Reva, you've had a nice long run.",
        "Reva: Admit it. You're replacing me with a younger face.",
        "Stephanie: No. A different face. A new direction.",
        "Reva: I'll show you a new direction. Coming up on \"guiding light.\"",
        "Edmund: Alonzo. Hi. I'm sorry I had to put you on hold. Look, about will, everything is going very well with cassie. It's just going to take a little more time.",
        "Jonathan: You got canned.",
        "Reva: Yes. ( Laughs ) and it's the best news I've had all year because now I can do whatever I want. oprah: Insider secrets to make",
        "Jonathan: Isn't it a little early for this?",
        "Reva: Are you sure you're my kid? ( Laughs )",
        "Tammy: Hi.",
        "Sandy: Hi.",
        "Reva: Hi. ( Laughs ) great music, right?",
        "Sandy: Right.",
        "Tammy: Are you okay?",
        "Reva: I've never felt better. And I'd offer you two a drink, but I know you can't have alcohol.",
        "Sandy: No.",
        "Reva: Because that would mean that I was a bad parent. Right, johnny?",
        "Jonathan: Right, mommy. ( Laughs )",
        "Sandy: Aren't you supposed to be at work, \"johnny\"?",
        "Reva: Oh, that's my fault. I sprung him.",
        "Jonathan: Reva, do you have a few extra bucks so I can get another drink?",
        "Reva: Did you go through all that trust fund money already?",
        "Jonathan: Can I have a few bucks or not?",
        "Reva: Yes, in my purse. Over there.",
        "Jonathan: Thank you.",

        "Josh: No luck, huh?",
        "Blake: Well, I told just about everybody in town about this party, except for, I don't know, maybe the guy collecting change at the mini-mart.",
        "Sebastian: Excuse moi.",
        "Josh: So, what's this proposition you wanted to talk to me about?",
        "Blake: Sebastian's about to knock alan off his throne and if you play your cards right, lewis could get half the pot.",
        "Josh: I'm listening. Go on.",
        "Sebastian: Well, I never had a slew of friends at my parties, either. I figure, their loss.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah.",
        "Sebastian: You know what, lizzie? It's not easy being different. Nobody gets you. I know that's hard because sometimes your family doesn't even get you. Do you know what? Van gogh, picasso, beethoven, they were all misunderstood.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. And then people act surprised when you do something crazy. They're here. I told you this was going to be a great party.",
        "Sebastian: Look at that.",
        "Lizzie: Everybody come in. Drinks are over here, food's over there. What are you doing back here?",
        "Coop: I actually lost my keys. I thought I may have left them... oh. Right here.",
        "Lizzie: Well, I told you everybody would come.",
        "Coop: Yeah.",
        "Lizzie: Word must really get around. I don't even know these people.",
        "Coop: Yeah. You're going to have a full house, here.",
        "Lizzie: What can I say? People just want to hang out with me.",
        "Coop: I guess so.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, we can move to the south pacific. An island somewhere, where alonzo can never get to will. We can take dinah with us.",
        "Cassie: Ugh.",
        "Edmund: Just until will turns of age. Okay, shh, shh, shh. Just think about it. Think about it. It's a last resort type of thing. ( Cell phone rings ) it's san cristobel. I have to get this. Wish me luck.",
        "Cassie: Hey. Sweetie, want a cookie?",
        "Dinah: You're a good mom, cassie. You're good with the boys. I don't think I ever really wanted to admit that.",
        "Cassie: I think it's the other way around. I think they're good with me. They're just so innocent and pure. Children just bring the best out of you.",
        "Dinah: All of them?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, all of them. Doesn't matter that I didn't give birth to him. The second they put them in your arms, it's like they're a part of you. Even the ones that think they're too big for hugs and kisses. ( Loud kisses )",
        "Dinah: Another one?",
        "Edmund: Well, tell alonzo he's going to be speaking to me whether he likes it or not!",
        "Dinah: Oh. That doesn't feel good, my stomach. Oh.",
        "Cassie: Dinah!",
        "Dinah: What happened?",
        "Cassie: You fainted. All right, I'm going to get an ice pack. Will you please call the doctor, edmund?",
        "Dinah: How long was I out?",
        "Edmund: Long enough to get our attention. Mission accomplished, dinah.",
        "Dinah: Golly, edmund, I don't know whether or not cassie actually deserves you. She wasn't going to take you back. She decided to because she needed you. Is that what you want? Is that what you really want?",
        "Cassie: Okay, I can't find it out there. What did the doctor say? Are you going to call the doctor?",
        "Dinah: I didn't call him. The baby is fine. The baby is fine. I just... I got woozy, I think that's it. ( Cell phone ringing )",
        "Edmund: I'll get it. Hello? Oh, alonzo. Wait, I'm having a hard time hearing you. Alonzo? It's about time you called me back. Now, what's all this business about two weeks? Oh, you think that's a good number, do you? It's a good time to wait? I don't think that was in the original document. It's completely unacceptable, alonzo. Are you having a problem with any of this? I don't see why you should be bullying this family.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) you guys.",
        "Sandy: Hey, your seat. So, are you still mad at me about turning the video off?",
        "Tammy: All I needed was a quick sketch of you-- you know, background-- for a class. What's the big deal?",
        "Sandy: I'm a lousy subject, that's all. Some people love to talk about themselves. Jonathan for one. Now, there's a guy in need of some psychological assistance.",
        "Tammy: Why is it that every time I bring up your past, you change the subject or clam up?",
        "Sandy: Because it's not important. It has nothing to do with now.",
        "Tammy: Where you come from has everything to do with who you are now, and I want to know everything about you, sandy.",
        "Sandy: All right. I like beautiful blondes, especially smart ones in college. A great personality doesn't hurt...",
        "Tammy: Sandy, stop it. I've told you all about my time growing up in foster care, everything about san cristobel, jonathan, every secret. You haven't even told me one.",
        "Sandy: You know everything you need to know.",
        "Tammy: I know that you went to school with jonathan, that your parents weren't around very much, but beyond that I really don't know anything.",
        "Sandy: You know I love my job at lewis. You know what makes me laugh. You know what I care about. Tammy, you know everything about me that's important. And you know what? You know me better than anyone has ever known me.",
        "Tammy: No. I can't leave it like this.",
        "Lizzie: I had no idea that throwing a party could be so exhausting. I'm so in demand. Wait, why are you still here?",
        "Coop: Well, I'm still waiting for my letter of recommendation.",
        "Freeloader: Yo. Hey, dude, thanks for the tip, man. This food is great.",
        "Coop: ( Clears throat )",
        "Lizzie: You invited him?",
        "Coop: Who, him? No. I saw him outside. I thought he was one of your friends.",
        "Lizzie: No wonder everybody's a stranger. You did this, didn't you?",
        "Coop: Come on. I've got better things to do with my time than to worry about your parties.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, coop, I don't need any favors, okay? I was doing just fine by myself.",
        "Coop: Yeah, you were. It looked real great from what i saw. Hey, what...",
        "Lizzie: Everybody, that's it. Get out. The party's over. Now.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, these are guests. What are you doing?",
        "Lizzie: You've got one minute to clear out of here or I'm calling the cops.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, come on. Can we just...",
        "Lizzie: Go, go. Move. This way. Come on. Thank you. Come on, let's go. Move.",
        "Coop: You know what? That's great. That'S... you know, have it your way. You always seem to.",
        "Lizzie: Uh-uh. No, no, no, no, no. You get back here. I am so not through with you.",
        "Josh: So, your sister was just telling me about your plans for alan spaulding.",
        "Sebastian: Is that before or after the takeover?",
        "Josh: You know, many have tried and failed.",
        "Blake: I think alan's been abusing his power for too long. I mean, look at what he did to harley. He's practically ruined her life.",
        "Josh: Yeah, I don't need another reason to go after alan spaulding. I'm just curious to know what yours might be.",
        "Sebastian: Well, let's just say, joshua, that I made my father a promise.",
        "Josh: ( Laughs ) that does not really instill confidence for me.",
        "Sebastian: No?",
        "Blake: His motivation shouldn't matter to you, as long as you want this.",
        "Josh: Look, I don't even run the day-to-day at lewis anymore. My nephew bill does that.",
        "Sebastian: Yeah, well, you know what? There's no problem there because his wife is already on our team.",
        "Josh: Olivia's on your team?",
        "Sebastian: Yes.",
        "Josh: Again, not really a selling point.",
        "Sebastian: ( Laughs )",
        "Blake: Come on, josh. Just take whatever you need out of this, go as far as you want. There's no obligations. Help us give alan what he deserves.",
        "Reva: Perfect. Mm. Thank you.",
        "Jonathan: You got canned?",
        "Reva: Yes. ( Laughs ) and it's the best news I've had all year, because now I can do whatever I want.",
        "Jonathan: Like drown yourself in a bar in the middle of the day?",
        "Reva: I'm celebrating. I'm celebrating. I say leave the grind to the young ones. I can go to aspen. I can take that beach vacation joshua wants to take. The possibilities are endless.",
        "Jonathan: You want me to talk to somebody?",
        "Reva: What, are you kidding? No. I never would have quit. Firing me was doing me a favor. I should send them a gift, you know? A bicycle with training wheels or a big red scooter. Here. You know what? You keep the party going, okay? I'll see you later.",
        "Jonathan: Are you leaving?",
        "Reva: Well, yeah. It's such a beautiful day, I'm going to take a walk. I'm going to go smell the roses. ( Laughs )",
        "Jonathan: I'll come with you.",
        "Reva: No. You stay here. The day is young. And so are you.",
        "Lizzie: You must be so happy, coop. Poor little rich girl throws a party and nobody shows up.",
        "Coop: Tell me exactly why you threw this party again?",
        "Lizzie: Because I wanted to have some fun. I wanted to get away from my family trying to tear everybody apart. I don't know, I haven't had any fun since my dad died. I guess I really just wanted to feel again.",
        "Coop: Feel what?",
        "Lizzie: Normal? I wanted to be like a normal person with friends and nothing to care about but boys and clothes and not much else.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, you can be normal.",
        "Lizzie: I can't, coop. I'm a spaulding, okay? We've got lots of money and power and everybody hates us, and that gives us more than enough reason to hate them back.",
        "Coop: Right, exactly. So now you're going to be like alan and especially you're going to be like your father, right?",
        "Lizzie: I am like my dad.",
        "Coop: No, li... lizzie, you are not like him at all.",
        "Lizzie: Fine. You know what? You win. I'm not going to fight about it anymore. This is a party and I think it's time for presents. So, here you go. Here's your happy whatever gift.",
        "Coop: What is it?",
        "Lizzie: It's your recommendation letter. Wait, no.",
        "Coop: No? What do you mean, no?",
        "Lizzie: Well, I don't want you to quit. I don't want you to go. I'm going to miss you.",
        "Coop: ( Laughs )",
        "Lizzie: Working here, anyway.",
        "Cassie: Let me talk to him. Let me talk to him.",
        "Edmund: What? Fine. Go ahead and try. Go ahead and try, alonzo. We're going to drag this out with the american courts for as long as it takes. As long as it takes, do you understand me? Will is not going to leave this family.",
        "Cassie: Hey. Hey, no he's not. No, he's not. I'm going to take will out back and play.",
        "Edmund: Right, right, right. Alonzo? Alonzo, I want you to stop your shouting. I am not going to let you hurt this family. Alonzo? Hi. I'm sorry I had to put you on hold. Look, about will, everything is going very well with cassie. It's just going to take a little more time. I need you to keep up the pressure and I'll take care of all the rest.",
        "Sandy: Okay, tammy. I'm not some guy with a secret like jonathan, some deep, dark secret. I'm just a guy who wants his past to stay in the past.",
        "Tammy: Why?",
        "Sandy: Because it's not important. What's important to me is here and now, and what's standing right in front of me. You know what I mean?",
        "Tammy: For a while I didn't even want to think about my life, much less talk about it. And you let me do that. You stood by me even when people came down on you. So, yes, I guess I do understand. I just... I want to know more about you.",
        "Sandy: You will. The longer we're together.",
        "Tammy: Okay, forget the assignment.",
        "Sandy: You promise?",
        "Tammy: Yes, I will not let it come between us. You're too important to me.",
        "Sandy: Hm. What do you say that I go and pay the check and we get out of here?",
        "Tammy: I say great.",
        "Sandy: Done.",
        "Tammy: Is reva coming back?",
        "Jonathan: Don't know.",
        "Tammy: You two seem to be getting along.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, well, we have our moments.",
        "Tammy: No fear of bad things happening to her with you around.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, it might be a little too late for that already.",
        "Reva: There's my baby. Solid. Reliable. Old. We're moving in a new direction. Looking for a sleeker, newer model. Something with not so many miles on it. ( Mirror breaks )",
        "Josh: Reva? What are you doing? Next, on \"guiding light.\"",
        "Cassie: Thank you. You know, you really are such a good friend. ( Gasps )"
