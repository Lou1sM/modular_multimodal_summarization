        "\"In a Moment\"",
        "Reva's doctor tells her that she felt a lump and it is necessary to have a mammogram now. Reluctantly, Reva has the test done after waiting for hours for her turn. She cries softly during the procedure. Afterwards, the same physician tells her she needs to talk to another physician about further testing; a needle biopsy for the mammogram showed something. Reva has the biopsy and the doctor tells her he will call with the results. After leaving and walking around, she realizes she cannot wait for the phone call and returns only to find another doctor assigned to her case; an oncologist. Reva is shocked that he is a cancer doctor. He explains in clinical terms about what he needs to do; a lumpectomy. Reva is less than pleased with the doctor and lights into him about the fact that he treats her as a \"color-coded number\". He turns the tables on her and informs her that she didn't have mammograms as she should have and needs to take responsibility. She agrees to the surgery the next morning.",
        "Reva goes for the surgery the next morning. Reva tells the doctor that she hasn't told her husband about the surgery. After she wakes up from the surgery, the doctor tells her that he is waiting on the laboratory results to see if the mass is benign or malignant and will call her. A sore Reva goes home and strolls around town. She receives a call from the doctor and goes back for the results. A shocked Reva walks out of her doctor's office. She hears the words echoing, \"As we feared, the tumor we removed from your breast was malignant\". Reva goes home to Josh. As she tries to tell him that she has something to tell him, he takes her away for her surprise at Cross Creek. She realizes that Cross Creek has been refurbished and is excited to see most of the original furniture. Josh tells her that he bought the place back from Olivia and now is theirs. He proceeds to tell her about the plans for the long-term care facility. He realizes she was trying to tell him something and Reva tells him it is nothing. . She grabs a knife and Josh's hand. They walk to the mantle and carve the word, \"forever\" under their names and the word \"always\". He hugs her and whispers, \"Now everything is right where it should be and that's the way it's going to stay always\". Reva looks sad"

        "Reva: Do you really think it's important that we do this right this minute?",
        "Dr. Gold: Mrs. Lewis, it's already been too long. And you have a soreness in your chest, not to mention the lump that I felt.",
        "Reva: It's left over from the accident I had. I know it is.",
        "Dr. Gold: Well, then, this is a way to confirm your diagnosis. Go. When I hear from the clinic, I'll be in touch. (Pager beeping ) I have to go myself. Good luck.",
        "Reva: Good luck. I can't even remember what I was about to say but I am determined not to let this get in my way. What if, what then what now. She's been late, so rearranged give me a moment. God, it's strange how life can change in a moment. My distractions the ramblings in my mind. Well, it's not too bad now. Baby, it's so cold without you. Oh, the time what if, what then, what now. Shifting lanes, so rearranged. Give me a moment God, it's strange how life can change in a moment. What if what now. God, it's strange how life can change in a moment. God, it's strange how life will change in a moment. I can't remember what I was about to say.",
        "Dr. Gold: I want to do some more testing. The pictures from the mammogram don't... they don't give us the clarity we need.",
        "Reva: Of?",
        "Dr. Gold: There's something there, and I want to find out what it is.",
        "Reva: And it can't be from the accident? Because it happened too long ago. Oh! Okay, you keep saying \"something,\" as in something else?",
        "Dr. Gold: I'd like to do a tissue sample.",
        "Reva: Tissue?",
        "Dr. Gold: Mm-hmm. A biopsy. A small needle. It's a simple procedure that will give us the information we need. Dr. Chou could handle it.",
        "Reva: Fine. I'll call and make an appointment.",
        "Dr. Gold: I already did. They're expecting you. You can tell your husband to meet you there.",
        "Reva: No. I don't want him to worry until I know what's going on. Look, I'm supposed to be going home to meet him at home. I mean, can it wait till tomorrow?",
        "Dr. Gold: Dr. Chou is in the Rauch Pavilion, third floor. Give him this when you get there. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Reva: Hey, you.",
        "Josh: Hey, darling, where are you?",
        "Reva: At the hospital. But, uh, I'll be out soon.",
        "Josh: Well, tell them to hurry, okay, because the fact is I miss you more and more every minute.",
        "Dr. Chou: Ms. Lewis?",
        "Reva: Yes.",
        "Josh: Who is that?",
        "Reva: I've got to go, hon. I won't be long, I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: ( Sighs )",
        "Cassie: You just can't wait to tell her, can you?",
        "Josh: I just... I'm not very good at keeping secrets, you know. I mean, I... it was everything I could do to not tell her on the phone just now.",
        "Cassie: So is there any word from the initial financing?",
        "Josh: No, no, not yet. But it's going to come through soon, and when it does, I'm going to have a world-class surprise for Reva.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: So that should be everything.",
        "Dr. Chou: I'm sorry. I'm finishing up with another patient. Please, have a seat. I'll take a look at the file. Be with you shortly.",
        "Reva: Oh. Oh, nice mermaid.",
        "Susie: She's a sea princess. Are you taking a test?",
        "Reva: Yeah. Yeah, I am.",
        "Susie: I took a test today. I passed, see? I hope you do, too.",
        "Reva: Well, that makes two of us.",
        "Dr. Chou: Mrs. Lewis, we're ready for you now.",
        "Susie: Her name's Reva.",
        "Dr. Chou: Oh! ( Laughs )",
        "Reva: And this is Susie.",
        "Dr. Chou: Hmm. People have a tendency to get nervous when they hear the word \"biopsy.\" There's no need to worry. The procedure's quick, easy and relatively painless.",
        "Reva: Oh, phew. I was worried maybe you were going to stick me with a needle in the breast and pull out a big hunk of tissue.",
        "Dr. Chou: Uh...",
        "Reva: That was a joke. ( Laughter ) I mean, I know... never mind.",
        "Dr. Chou: I should have the results soon. I'll give you a call at home so that we can...",
        "Reva: Oh, no, no, not at home. I want to keep this private for now.",
        "Dr. Chou: Even from your husband?",
        "Reva: It's been emotional enough, so I don't want to worry him about something I don't know anything about yet. I mean, why stir things up when it's probably just a false alarm, right?",
        "Dr. Chou: Well, we always hope for false alarms. But even so, I will need to contact you.",
        "Reva: Well, I'll... thank you.",
        "Dr. Chou: Oh, here.",
        "Reva: I'll give you my cell phone number.",
        "Dr. Chou: Try to put all this out of your mind till I call with the results.",
        "Reva: Okay. Thanks.",
        "Dr. Chou: Mm-hmm.",
        "Reva: Doctor, what happens if it's not a false alarm?",
        "Dr. Chou: Let's take this one step at a time. I found that's the best approach.",
        "Reva: Great. One step at a time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Sorry.",
        "Tammy: Reva! Hi.",
        "Reva: Hi.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, welcome back. Your trip to Paris?",
        "Reva: Oh! Right, thanks.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, how was it? Did you have a good time with Marah?",
        "Reva: She ran me ragged, but, yeah, we had a great time. It just already seems so long ago.",
        "Tammy: Are you okay?",
        "Reva: Fine, great. I'm a little jet lagged, but couldn't be better.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, with us, too. What? Reva, um... Mom, I'm glad you're back, because I owe you an apology.",
        "Reva: Oh, you know, let's not go there.",
        "Jonathan: I lied to you when I asked you to help me with Tammy, and then I let you down and I put you in a really...",
        "Reva: Stop. I don't want any apologies. I don't want any explanations. Cassie said that she was okay. Josh told me that she's okay with the two of you being together, and that's that. I mean, if she's okay with it, then who am I to say I'm not? Hmm?",
        "Tammy: Okay.",
        "Reva: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jonathan: So does this mean you're not really pissed at me anymore?",
        "Reva: Not at the moment, so let's try to keep it that way.",
        "Jonathan: Maybe I'm still pissed at you.",
        "Reva: I'm sorry for everything I've done wrong. I do want to move forward, I swear.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, hey, it's okay. I was kidding. ( Laughter ) I was joking.",
        "Reva: I know.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, I just want us all to be okay so we can be a big, happy, you know, whatever we are. ( Laughter) Reva, we were going to go see a movie, but do you want us to stay...",
        "Reva: Oh, no, no. Go, please. We'll catch up later. No rush. I swear.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. See 'ya.",
        "Reva: Mm-hmm.",
        "Tammy: Bye.",
        "Reva: Bye. ( Cell phone rings ) Oh, good. Wanda, what's up? No, no, I'll check on it when I get to the office. Okay. Screw this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "( Knock on the door )",
        "Colin: Come in.",
        "Reva: Dr. Chou, I know I said I'd wait for the results before I showed up. I'm in the wrong room. I'm sorry, I was looking for Dr. Chou.",
        "Colin: Uh, yeah, I got that. Are you Reva Lewis?",
        "Reva: Yes. Why?",
        "Colin: Oh, good. Well, I was just looking over your test results. We were about to call you and ask you to come in.",
        "Reva: Where's Dr. Chou?",
        "Colin: Uh, I don't know. Lunch, maybe. It doesn't matter. I've taken over your case. I'm Dr. McCabe.",
        "Reva: Why are you taking over my case?",
        "Colin: I'm an Oncologist.",
        "Reva: A cancer doctor?",
        "Colin: Yeah, that's right. Please, take a seat. I can't remember what I was about to say.",
        "Colin: Oh. Mrs. Lewis, please, sit.",
        "Reva: I'd rather stand. And more than that, I would like to know exactly what's going on.",
        "Colin: You have a mass in your breast that might be a malignancy. Your mammogram and the needle biopsy gave us a lot of information, but we're going to need another procedure to help us determine exactly the precise nature of this mass.",
        "Reva: Oh, another needle biopsy?",
        "Colin: We're looking at surgery now-- a wide local excision, or WLE, also known as a lumpectomy. Uh, I said \"lumpectomy\", not \"mastectomy\". There's a big difference. We wouldn't get to the latter, if at all, for a while. What I need to know now is the exact nature of this lump, if it's a tumor-- and if it's a tumor, whether or not it's malignant. Uh, I was thinking first thing in the morning.",
        "Reva: What?",
        "Colin: The time for the procedure.",
        "Reva: Oh, no. I mean... well, that's too soon. I don't even know if it's the right thing. I'm just supposed to take your word for it?",
        "Colin: You're welcome to do some research or seek out a second opinion. I encourage my patients to be proactive. My concern is that being that you've skipped yearly mammograms, I'm concerned you might be inclined to avoid treatment, and that would be a very, very bad move.",
        "Reva: Avoid treatment? I'm not crazy.",
        "Colin: Yes, tomorrow morning looks like it would be good. ( Phone rings ) Just a second. Yes. Mm-hmm. They took a frozen section? Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay.",
        "Reva: Excuse me, where are you going?",
        "Colin: Oh, I'll be back in just a minute. Make yourself comfortable.",
        "Reva: Colin McCabe, M.D. American Society of Oncologists, Colin McCabe.",
        "Colin: Oh, where were you going?",
        "Reva: I haven't decided yet. Tahiti, maybe India.",
        "Colin: Uh...",
        "Reva: I know, take a seat.",
        "Colin: ...Take a seat. All right. Where were we?",
        "Reva: Well, you were just about to tell me why I should let you cut me open.",
        "Colin: Excuse me?",
        "Reva: I don't know you. I mean, you're a doctor. I know that because you have these diplomas on your wall. But Dr. Chou never mentioned you. The only information I have is the information I got when I walked through that door about an hour ago. And I have to say that I haven't been exactly thrilled because when I saw you first, you had your nose shoved in a file, and then you lectured me about the difference between a lumpectomy and a mastectomy-- which I know the difference, by the way-- without so much as a \"hello\" or a \"hi, how are you feeling?\" And now you have me scheduled for this surgery first thing tomorrow morning because it works for you. So I have to wonder: A, why I should do this; and B, why I should let you do it?",
        "Colin: Oh, wow. All right. A, because you need it; and B, because I'm the best.",
        "Reva: I have shoes in my closet older than you.",
        "Colin: Oh, okay. Well, age is irrelevant.",
        "Reva: It's relevant to me, damn it. You know why? Because this morning when I got up, my only concern was what I was going to have for breakfast. And now I have to have a test to find out whether or not I have cancer. You know, you already have me scheduled for some surgery that could change my life, but have you treated me like a human being, much less a person? I mean, this person? I mean, have you even recognized the fact that my name is Reva Lewis? I'm not just some color-coded file with a number on it.",
        "Colin: I'll treat you like I treat all of my patients, and I assure you you'll be very happy with my skill level.",
        "Reva: See, that's what I'm talking about. How do you know I'll be happy? You don't know what makes me happy because you don't know me.",
        "Colin: Well, I'm getting a sense of you very, very quickly.",
        "Reva: I'm not all your other patients; I'm me. So if you don't want to take the time to get to know me, I'm sure as hell going to take the time to get to know you.",
        "Colin: Okay, well, how much can you learn between now and tomorrow morning?",
        "Reva: Tomorrow morning was your idea, not mine.",
        "Colin: Are you going to seek a second opinion?",
        "Reva: Yes! Well, no, actually, because I'm having a hard enough time absorbing what you're saying to me.",
        "Colin: Well, then it would be foolish for you to put this off, Mrs. Lewis.",
        "Reva: No. It would be foolish to rush into doing something where I don't have the confidence in the guy who's going to be holding the scalpel.",
        "Colin: Okay, again, you are entitled...",
        "Reva: Yeah, I know. I know I'm entitled. I know I'm entitled to a second opinion. You know why I know that? Because I had to answer questionnaires piled this high when you don't even have to give me any answers, like how are you feeling? Do you perform well under pressure or do you get a little rattled? Or do you have family problems that maybe, you know-- God forbid-- you may bring into the OR? Or, you know, maybe you get a little shaky on that first morning procedure because of the three martinis you had the night before!",
        "Colin: Okay, this is ridiculous.",
        "Reva: No. Whether or not you're reliable is ridiculous?",
        "Colin: Enough.",
        "Reva: No. I'll tell you when it's enough. Look, Doctor, if this little procedure seems a little personal, it's because the one you want to do to me is the most personal as it can get because you want to cut open my breast.",
        "Colin: It's called surgery.",
        "Reva: And if you botch it, I'm not the only one that suffers. I have a husband, I have kids. I want you to put me first when you scrub in. I want you to promise me that you'll do that, and I want to believe you.",
        "Colin: Well, I guess I better use some pretty strong soap.",
        "Reva: I'm just not another case. You've got to care.",
        "Colin: What about you, Mrs. Lewis? Do you have to care?",
        "Reva: What are you talking about?",
        "Colin: When's the last time you had a mammogram before this afternoon? I mean, there's no record of it here in your... in your case study. How about that nagging ache you were experiencing? How long was that going on before you did something about it? Which you know you should have. Because, again, there's no... there's no mention of it here in your chart.",
        "Reva: I know.",
        "Colin: Look, my job is to help you, which I can do, but don't put this all on me. You have a responsibility here, too, and let's be honest, you shirked it. Look, tomorrow morning, when I walk into that OR, I'm going to do the same thing I always do, which is to do the very best that I know how. You just have to trust that, just as I have to trust that all this passion you're showing will be channeled into dealing with your condition in a positive, mature, responsible manner. So, Mrs. Lewis, will I see you tomorrow morning?",
        "Reva: First thing in the morning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Okay, look, I will tell you the minute I get the green light from the bank. But when I call, you better be ready to go, okay? Great, thanks. Bye hey, how you doing? I... you know what? I didn't even hear you come in. Clean bill of health?",
        "Reva: Squeaky clean.",
        "Josh: Excellent. ( Laughs )",
        "Reva: Why do you look like that?",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Reva: Like you have a canary knocking on your teeth from inside.",
        "Josh: ( Laughs ) Take off your jacket, relax, sit down, dinner's almost ready.",
        "Reva: You going to tell me about that surprise?",
        "Josh: Ah, let's see. No, I don't think that I am. I'm going to go check on the steaks. I opened a bottle of wine. Pour yourself a glass, if you like.",
        "Reva: Oh, no wine before surgery. Surgery.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: What are you doing up so early?",
        "Reva: I have so many things to take care of this morning.",
        "Josh: Are you all right?",
        "Reva: I am rearing to go. See? And there's plenty more where that came from. Lots and lots. Years of it.",
        "Josh: Reva, get back here as quick as you can, okay?",
        "Reva: Why wouldn't I?",
        "Josh: Well, I'm just saying that I might have that surprise ready for you later.",
        "Reva: Well, finally.",
        "Josh: Hey, I don't like keeping secrets from you, okay? But in this case, it's gonna be worth it.",
        "Reva: I know what you mean.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colin: Good morning.",
        "Reva: Oh, hey, from your lips to God's ear.",
        "Colin: We're going to put you under now, all right? Once the mask is in place, count backwards from 100.",
        "Reva: Is that 100 with the bottles of beer on the wall or without?",
        "Colin: Do you want the nurse to tell anything to your husband?",
        "Reva: Uh, no. He's not with me. I... I'll involve him when and if it's necessary, and not before.",
        "Colin: He doesn't know anything about this, Mrs. Lewis? I think it would be advisable to...",
        "Reva: Let's just do this, okay? Okay. Oh, wait. Dr. McCabe?",
        "Colin: What is it?",
        "Reva: Nothing. Oh.",
        "Colin: Lie back.",
        "Reva: Ah. Ah! How did it go?",
        "Colin: Pretty much as I expected it would. The lab's working on the answers we need now.",
        "Reva: So we just wait to find out whether or not the lump was benign or...",
        "Colin: Malignant, right. The nurse should be in soon. Do we have a contact number for you?",
        "Reva: My cell phone. So that's it? That's... that's all you're going to say to me?",
        "Colin: Well, there is nothing more I can tell you right now. You might feel some discomfort while the stitches heal. Drink plenty of fluids, get some rest.",
        "Reva: Fluids? That's it?",
        "Colin: For now. I'll call.",
        "Reva: Wait. What was the music?",
        "Colin: Excuse me?",
        "Reva: In the operating room, who was that you were playing?",
        "Colin: You and your questions. ( Chuckles )",
        "Reva: Well, there is only one answer I really care about. Joshua!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susie: Hi!",
        "Reva: Hi! We keep bumping into each other, don't we? It's Susie, right? How's your mom? At the hospital, you didn't say why she was there. Is she okay?",
        "Susie: She has to go every week. You know what was really bad?",
        "Reva: What?",
        "Susie: All her hair came out. She cried about it one night, only she doesn't know I heard her.",
        "Reva: Well, I hope she gets better.",
        "Susie: Me, too. Sometimes I feel like crying.",
        "Reva: You know what? It's okay.",
        "Susie: There's my dad. Bye, Reva.",
        "Reva: Bye. Take care of yourself and your... mom. What the... oh, come on! I just charged this battery this morning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Salesman: Trust me, this is the model you want.",
        "Customer #1: I just don't know. ( Overlapping dialogue )",
        "Reva: Excuse me, excuse me, I have an emergency here. My... do you have any batteries?",
        "Cassie: Well, this looks like fun!",
        "Reva: Oh, Cassie, I can't believe it! My phone is dead, and I need it fixed now. I mean, it... of all of the times for this to happen.",
        "Cassie: Honey, what is wrong?",
        "Reva: I'm expecting a call from Josh. He said he's got some kind of a surprise for me and that he'd call me.",
        "Cassie: Uh-huh. Well, it sounds like an emergency situation. Super sis to the rescue.",
        "Reva: Well, no new messages.",
        "Cassie: Well, then, you haven't missed any calls from Josh, now, have you? Life is good. Mm-hmm?",
        "Reva: Right. Thanks, super sis.",
        "Cassie: ( Chuckles ) You're welcome. I'm going to take off. But Reva, don't wait for Josh to call. I think you should call him. You'll be glad you did.",
        "Reva: Now, wait a... why would you... ( cell phone rings )",
        "Reva: Doctor, guess where I am? I'm standing in this fabulously expensive boutique, and I'm eyeballing a very sexy, low-cut dress, and I mean low-cut. Should I buy it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colin: As we feared, the tumor we removed from your breast was malignant. ( Echoing ) malignant. Malignant. Malignant. Our hope is that we were able to remove all the cancer, but we can't be certain. ( Echoing ) malignant. Malignant.",
        "Reva: No. Not now.",
        "Josh: I thought I heard your car drive up. Perfect timing.",
        "Reva: I was sneezing.",
        "Josh: ( Laughs ) Okay!",
        "Reva: Are you going somewhere?",
        "Josh: Yes. As a matter of fact, that's part of the surprise. In fact, another part of the surprise is that you're coming with me.",
        "Reva: What?",
        "Josh: Yeah. Everything fell into place, and now I'm ready to tell you... show you this good news-- no, this amazing thing.",
        "Reva: Oh. Well, I have some news, too.",
        "Josh: Okay, it's going to have to wait because we have to get to the airport.",
        "Reva: Airport?",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Reva: Just wait, wait a minute. Just slow down.",
        "Josh: Reva, I don't want to slow down. In fact, for the first time in my life, I just... I want to move as fast as I possibly can, even faster, and not look back, okay? Wow, that's weird. I sound like you right now, don't I?",
        "Reva: Is that part of your surprise?",
        "Josh: I'm not going to tell you because this is something I want to show you. Just let me do that, okay? Please let me show you the thing that's going to change or lives.",
        "Reva: Okay...",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Reva: ...Show me. Did you get Olivia's permission to be here? Does she know we're here because... oh, my God.",
        "Josh: Surprise.",
        "Reva: How?",
        "Josh: You like it?",
        "Reva: It's exactly the way it was. The rocker looks exactly... it is! This is the rocker that I used to rock Marah to sleep in.",
        "Josh: Yes, it is, Reva. In fact, most of the furniture you see in here, right here, most of the stuff, it's original. In fact, here, take a look at this desk over here.",
        "Reva: H.B.'s desk. I can't tell you how many times I saw him sitting behind it till all hours of the night working on one project or another.",
        "Josh: A lot of great memories in this place, Reva.",
        "Reva: Joshua, what's going on?",
        "Josh: I'm sorry. What do you mean, \"what's going on\"?",
        "Reva: The pictures, they're not Olivia's pictures; they're ours.",
        "Josh: Yeah. In fact, that's because this whole place is ours, Reva, and everything in it.",
        "Reva: I don't understand.",
        "Josh: Reva, honey, I bought Cross Creek for you. This place is, once again, a Lewis home.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) Joshua, listen to me. There's something I want to...",
        "Josh: Just give me a couple more minutes, okay, because there's more.",
        "Reva: What?",
        "Josh: There's more to the surprise. Sit down. I want to show you something. Remember you were saying earlier how H.B. used to sit at this desk, you know, working on stuff after everybody else had gone to bed. Working on projects, right? Well, this here... this is one of those projects. Say hello to the H.B. Lewis Center, Reva, long-term care for returning soldiers and their families. I mean, we've got a state-of- the-art hospital, rehabilitation center, housing, parks, shopping-- everything! Everything.",
        "Reva: H.B. drew up these plans himself?",
        "Josh: Yeah. I found them right there in that desk drawer. I mean, they were just sort of jammed in the back, you know. And the funny thing is that he used to talk all of the time about wanting to do something for the veterans, but I don't think it really hit me until I found these papers. And then something... Reva, when I saw these, something happened to me.",
        "Reva: What do you mean?",
        "Josh: I've been searching for something like this really my whole life, you know, to do something significant, something that would last, Reva. ( Laughs )",
        "Reva: You're going to build this place?",
        "Josh: Yes, right here at Cross Creek. In fact, I hope to break ground by Memorial Day. ( Laughs )",
        "Reva: Well, that's, um...",
        "Josh: It's right around the corner-- I know that, I know that-- but I feel like a man with a mission. And that's exactly what I am, a man with a mission, and I love this feeling, Reva! I love it almost as much as I love you. I feel like I found my life's work, Reva, and I have my life's partner at my side again. And I am the most blessed man on the planet. I am going to make this happen.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, you know, life can come up with some surprises of its own, though.",
        "Josh: Oh, really? ( Chuckles )",
        "Reva: Yeah.",
        "Josh: You're telling me! After everything we've been through in our lives. But Reva, it would take a whole lot to derail this train. I mean, there's momentum here, there's a forward motion here that's happening, and I'm going to make sure that that continues. I've never wanted anything more in my life, Reva, and I'm going to make this thing happen.",
        "Reva: Well, you know what this woman says? This woman says that that train isn't going to slow down, much less derail, not if I have anything to say about it. Because you deserve this, Bud. After all the emergencies that you've had to deal with, all of the dramas that you've had to deal with, mostly coming from me.",
        "Josh: Now, Reva.",
        "Reva: This is your time. It is.",
        "Josh: Reva, darlin'...",
        "Reva: No, no, just let me finish. You know, you've always been so busy putting your dreams on hold, you know, making sure that we all reached our own. You did that because you are our rock. We always turn to you. Well, you know what? We're all going to have to wait now because it's the rock's turn.",
        "Josh: Thank you.",
        "Reva: You're welcome.",
        "Josh: Those are exactly the words I was hoping you would say.",
        "Reva: Yeah?",
        "Josh: Yeah. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry. You were trying to tell me something earlier, and I kept interrupting you. What was it?",
        "Reva: Oh, pssst! It's nothing.",
        "Josh: ( Laughs ) Oh, come on!",
        "Reva: Really. No, it's not. It's really... it's not important and I really don't want to talk about it. So let's just, you know... I want to do something. I remember that there's something here. And, I mean, it worked for you, and I know it's going to work for me, too. So you come here. I need your help.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Reva: Let's see if I can not cut myself.",
        "Josh: Now, everything is right where it should be. That's the way it's going to stay. Always.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Beth: I think you better get over here.",
        "Lizzie: Coop! Granddad, what's going on here?",
        "Ashlee: I guess I can tell you about Lizzie.",
        "Mallet: Hey.",
        "Dinah: Oh, I'm sorry. I was trying so hard to be quiet, not to wake you up.",
        "Mallet: You mean so I wouldn't find out what that phone call was all about?",
        "Dinah: Alan-Michael, if you know anything about my father, I will find out."
