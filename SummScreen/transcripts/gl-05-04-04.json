        "Beth: Cassie, hi. ",
        "Cassie: Hey, Beth. ",
        "Beth: Are Lizzie and Tammy upstairs? \n",
        "\r\nCassie: Yes. Lizzie is coaxing Tammy out of her room. She's mad at me so she's \r\nlocked herself in. ",
        "Beth: Ah. Is this about the other night? \r\nAbout the kiss? ",
        "Cassie: How do you know about that? \n",
        "Beth: Edmund told me. Reluctantly. I \r\npractically had to drag it out of him. ",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Well, he's upset and it's just \r\none big misunderstanding, Beth. ",
        "Beth: That's what I thought. Lizzie will get \r\nher to come out. ",
        "Cassie: We'll see. ",
        "Beth: I mean, who better to understand \r\nTammy\u2019s problems, right? ",
        "Cassie: No offense, Beth, but Tammy\u2019s \r\nproblems don't compare to Lizzie's. ",
        "Tammy: You didn\u2019t see what you think you saw.\r\n",
        "Lizzie: Okay, Tammy, I know a kiss when I see \r\none, and that was definitely a kiss. ",
        "Tammy: No, it wasn\u2019t. ",
        "Lizzie: Sweetie, you don't have to lie to me. \r\nI'm not going to tell anyone. ",
        "Tammy: I would kill you if you told anyone, \r\nLizzie. ",
        "Lizzie: Don't worry! Gosh. So, was it good?\r\n",
        "Tammy: Would you please just shut up? \n",
        "\r\nLizzie: What? Edmund's a good-looking guy. Of course, I always looked at him as \r\nan uncle, but I guess you... ",
        "Tammy: Oh, do not start with me, okay? I'm \r\nnot in the mood for your games. ",
        "Lizzie: It just came out wrong. ",
        "Tammy: Yeah. I bet. ",
        "\r\nLizzie: What? Why do you have to be so defensive? Now, I brought you some food. \r\nAre you hungry? ",
        "Tammy: Yeah. ",
        "\r\nLizzie: Okay, well, so am I. We can talk and eat if you want, but if you don't \r\nwant to, that's okay, too. ",
        "Tammy: What did you bring? ",
        "Lizzie: Oh, let's see. We've got sodas, \r\nsandwiches and cheesecake. Want some? ",
        "Tammy: But I don't want to talk about Edmund.\r\n",
        "Lizzie: Okay. ",
        "Tammy: Or my mom, okay? ",
        "Lizzie: That's fine. ",
        "Tammy: I mean it. ",
        "Lizzie: Fine! Okay, there's just one thing.\r\n",
        "Tammy: Lizzie. ",
        "\r\nLizzie: I saw you when you guys kissed and from where I was standing, it looked \r\nlike you both were enjoying it. So, was I right? ",
        "\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Salerno: So, what are you really up to, \r\nDanny? ",
        "Danny: You think I'm pulling something?\r\n",
        "Salerno: Simple question, my friend. \n",
        "\r\nDanny: Yeah, one you don't have to ask. Vinnie, come on. How long have we known \r\neach other? I don't operate like that. ",
        "Salerno: Try telling that to mamacita. \n",
        "Danny: Vinnie, have I ever broken my word to \r\nyou? ",
        "\r\nSalerno: You've always been an honorable guy with me, Danny, but that doesn't \r\nmean I'm buying what you're selling. ",
        "Danny: You know, I came here with nothing but \r\nrespect... ",
        "\r\nSalerno: Hey, hey. Save it, kid. All right? I was born at night, but it sure as \r\nhell wasn't last night. ",
        "Danny: Well, I don't know what to tell you, \r\nVinnie, except you got to trust me. ",
        "Salerno: No, I don't have to do anything.\r\n",
        "Danny: Well, then... so why are we still \r\ntalking? What do you want from me? ",
        "Salerno: I want you to tell me what your game \r\nis, Danny. And this time, no more lies. ",
        "\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Michelle: Danny? Oh, hey, Tony. ",
        "Tony: Okay, listen, Michelle, I need to talk \r\nto you about Danny. ",
        "Michelle: Is he all right? ",
        "Tony: Yeah, why wouldn't he be? He's fine.\r\n",
        "Michelle: I thought, um... I thought maybe \r\nyou'd seen him. ",
        "Tony: No, not since the other day. I'm \r\nworried about him, Michelle. ",
        "Michelle: Did he say something to you? \n",
        "Tony: Just that he's upset about not winning \r\nthe election. ",
        "Michelle: Right. Well, we're both pretty \r\nangry about what happened. ",
        "\r\nTony: Yeah, no, I know. And rightfully so. I'm just... I'm afraid of what he \r\nmight do. I'm not trying to scare you, I just... I've never seen him like this \r\nbefore. ",
        "Michelle: Okay. And what are you saying, \r\nTony? ",
        "Tony: I think he could slip, Michelle, and go \r\nback to the life. ",
        "Michelle: Could you blame him if he did?\r\n",
        "\r\nTony: Okay. So, you're okay? You're okay if Danny goes back in the life? That's \r\nwhat you're saying? ",
        "\r\nMichelle: Of course I'm not okay with it, Tony. I hate the idea. I'm just \r\nsaying, I understand that he might be tempted. ",
        "Tony: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you mean, \r\n\"understand,\" Michelle? ",
        "\r\nMichelle: Tony, he's done everything he could to redeem himself. He tried to \r\nprove this town that the Santos name is more than guns and drugs. ",
        "Tony: I know and he almost made it all right.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, he almost did. ",
        "\r\nTony: I don't understand what's going on here. It's like, it's okay for you to \r\nstand here and justify this... ",
        "Michelle: I'm not justifying anything. \n",
        "\r\nTony: All right, then answer me this, Michelle: What are you going to do... what \r\nare you going to do if he does go back? Huh? Are you going to turn the other \r\ncheek? ",
        "Michelle: I don't know, okay? I'm just really \r\nangry that they took his dream away. ",
        "\r\nTony: I think you're angry at the wrong people. Honestly, I do. Listen, \r\nMichelle, Danny bought the votes. ",
        "Michelle: No, he didn\u2019t. ",
        "Tony: I'm telling you he did. ",
        "Michelle: Oh, he told you that? Those were \r\nhis words? Danny said that? ",
        "Tony: Not exactly, no. ",
        "Michelle: Because he didn't do it, Tony.\r\n",
        "\r\nTony: Michelle, I admire you for sticking up for him. I do. But this is not what \r\nDanny needs right now. ",
        "Michelle: Okay. Tell me what he needs. \n",
        "\r\nTony: I don't know. Just don't let him do something that the both of you will \r\nregret, all right? ",
        "Michelle: How am I supposed to do that, Tony? \r\nThis is killing him. ",
        "Tony: Pull him back. Make him see. If not, \r\nMichelle, leave him. ",
        "Michelle: Yeah, we tried that one, remember? \r\nIt doesn't work. ",
        "\r\nTony: Okay, so this is how you do it. This is exactly what you do, right? You \r\njust stand by and watch the good wife? ",
        "Michelle: I'm proud of being Mrs. Danny \r\nSantos. ",
        "Tony: Okay. And how long is it going to last? \r\nHuh? ",
        "\r\nMichelle: I don't know. I don't know. All I know is that I want Danny to do what \r\nhe needs to do, go through what he needs and know that I am here for him. This \r\nis his home. I am here. ",
        "Tony: And you can do that? ",
        "Michelle: I have to. I love him. ",
        "\r\nTony: I know you do. That's a good, but love doesn't keep you from getting hurt, \r\nMichelle. You know that, right? ",
        "Michelle: Oh, I'm not worried about me.\r\n",
        "\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Danny: You know what, Vinnie? I'm insulted.\r\n",
        "Salerno: Maybe I should add a little injury \r\nto that. ",
        "\r\nDanny: Oh, yeah? Is that why you wanted to get me alone? You tell me now I need \r\nto watch my back? ",
        "Salerno: It's not your back I'm worried \r\nabout. ",
        "Danny: If you think I'm such a threat, \r\nVinnie, take care of it. ",
        "Salerno: Is this how two old friends talk to \r\neach other? ",
        "\r\nDanny: Well, then stop wasting my time. Otherwise I'd like to go and pick up a \r\ntoy for my kid and a little something for my wife. ",
        "\r\nSalerno: Ah, the lovely Michelle. How's she doing, Danny? Is she on board with \r\nthis? If she has a problem, you have a problem. ",
        "Danny: Vinnie? Leave my family out of this.\r\n",
        "Salerno: I'm just saying. ",
        "\r\nDanny: Yeah, I know what you're saying. You know where my wife and kid are; I \r\nknow where yours are. ",
        "Salerno: Friends don't foster good relations, \r\nDanny, but neither does secrets. ",
        "Danny: You're a lot smarter than those other \r\njerks, Vinnie. You are. ",
        "Salerno: I knew it. I knew it. What's your \r\nplan, Danny boy? ",
        "Danny: No, no, no, no, no. You know, I want \r\nto earn your trust before I present it to you. ",
        "Salerno: No, no. Come on, come on. I need a \r\nlittle taste. ",
        "Danny: When the time's right. ",
        "Salerno: I don't like being kept in the dark, \r\nDanny. ",
        "Danny: It's not forever, trust me. It's going \r\nto be well worth the wait. ",
        "Salerno: Yeah? Big? ",
        "Danny: I am going to make you so much money.\r\n",
        "Salerno: Oh, yeah. That's music to my ears.\r\n",
        "Danny: You haven't heard nothing yet, Vinnie.\r\n",
        "Salerno: Soon, Danny. Soon. ",
        "Danny: Vinnie? Let's keep this between \r\nourselves. ",
        "\r\nSalerno: Oh, yeah. I wouldn't have it any other way. I'm glad we could have this \r\ntalk, okay? ",
        "Danny: Me, too. ",
        "Salerno: Safe trip. ",
        "Danny: All right. ",
        "Salerno: Call you when I get there. \n",
        "Danny: Get where? ",
        "Salerno: \nSpringfield. Didn't I tell you? It's going to be my new home away from home. \n",
        "\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Rick: All right, so, are you feeling okay?\r\n",
        "Phillip: Yeah. ",
        "Rick: Good. ",
        "Phillip: I do, I feel good. I'm a little \r\ntired, but I feel good. ",
        "Rick: Good. ",
        "Phillip: Thanks for being there. ",
        "Rick: Well... ",
        "Phillip: It's nice to wake up and see your \r\nface. ",
        "Rick: Where else would I be? ",
        "\r\nPhillip: Oh, I don't know. How about home with your wife and your daughter? That \r\nsounds nice, doesn't it? Go home at the end of a long day to a family that loves \r\nyou. ",
        "Rick: You have that, buddy. That and a \r\nhousehold staff, you spoiled brat. ",
        "\r\nPhillip: I just want... simple. It's been so long since anything has seemed \r\nsimple, probably since Beth and Lizzie. ",
        "\r\nRick: You know what, buddy? Once you're out of this place, you're going to start \r\nall over again, make your life whatever it is you want it to be. ",
        "\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Beth: Cassie, I wasn't comparing Tammy to \r\nLizzie. ",
        "Cassie: Good, because there's no comparison.\r\n",
        "\r\nBeth: I just meant that they're the same age. You know, Lizzie isn't perfect, \r\nbut what child is? I know that that's hard to admit. ",
        "Cassie: I don't think Tammy\u2019s perfect. She's \r\njust no Lizzie. ",
        "\r\nBeth: What the hell does that mean, Cassie? You know what? Never mind. You're \r\nmisunderstanding what I'm trying to say. ",
        "Cassie: I don't think I am. ",
        "Beth: Well, it seems like it. ",
        "\r\nCassie: Everything with Lizzie? Not your typical teenage growing pains. Tammy \r\nnever arranged for a pregnant woman to fall down the stairs and she never \r\nkidnapped anyone's baby. ",
        "Beth: Yes. Lizzie has dealt with some serious \r\nissues. ",
        "Cassie: (Scoffs) Well, now, that's a bit of \r\nan understatement, don't you think? ",
        "Beth: I'll admit that I was slow to see them.\r\n",
        "Cassie: Do you see it now? ",
        "\r\nBeth: I understand that you're upset with Tammy, but that's no reason to take it \r\nout on me. Instead, you should be hoping that my daughter gets through to yours, \r\nbecause obviously, you couldn\u2019t. ",
        "Lizzie: So? Give me some details. ",
        "Tammy: I won't hesitate to throw you out of \r\nhere. ",
        "Lizzie: Okay, fine. I'll shut up. ",
        "Tammy: You're so stupid sometimes. So, I hear \r\nyour mom read your journal. ",
        "Tammy: You know about the journal? \n",
        "Lizzie: I overheard her talking with your \r\naunt Reva about it. ",
        "Tammy: You were eavesdropping. ",
        "Lizzie: It's a true art form. ",
        "\r\nTammy: Okay, I'll keep that in mind for future reference. I should have just \r\nburned that damned journal! ",
        "\r\nLizzie: Well, personally, I won't keep one. My shrink tried to get me to do it \r\nand I just made up stuff and overheard her and just made up stuff and wrote it \r\nall in there. You know, it never fails. Journals have this creepy little way of \r\ngetting into the wrong person's hands. ",
        "Tammy: I didn't think she would read it. She \r\nisn't like that. ",
        "Lizzie: Underneath, they're all like that, \r\nokay? ",
        "\r\nTammy: I could kill her. What's even worse is I feel like a complete idiot, \r\nlocking myself in my bedroom. What am I, 12? ",
        "\r\nLizzie: Well, what else are you supposed to do? I mean, your mom wouldn't shut \r\nup about it. ",
        "Tammy: She still won\u2019t. ",
        "\r\nLizzie: My mom's the same way. It's not like they're telling you anything you \r\ndon't already know. ",
        "Tammy: I just wish this was over. What did I \r\ndo? ",
        "Lizzie: You like older men. So what? \n",
        "Tammy: I do not like older men. ",
        "Lizzie: Well, you could have fooled me.\r\n",
        "Tammy: I do not like older men. I like Joey.\r\n",
        "Lizzie: Okay, can we just forget about Joey \r\nright now, because it's confusing the issue. ",
        "Tammy: What issue? ",
        "\r\nLizzie: This, Tammy. You got your mom right where you want her. She read your \r\njournal. Who cares if you kissed her boyfriend? She invaded your privacy. \n",
        "Tammy: Yeah? What do you mean, I've \"got \r\nher.\" ",
        "\r\nLizzie: I keep forgetting how green you really are. Okay, look, you didn't do \r\nanything wrong. ",
        "\r\nTammy: Okay, look, do you think you could just maybe help me figure out a way to \r\nget out of here with just a little bit of my dignity still intact? ",
        "Lizzie: Dignity? Tammy, you're going to walk \r\nout of here with a lot more than that. ",
        "\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Cassie: I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I was \r\nout of line. ",
        "Beth: Yeah, you were. But you're also \r\nfrustrated. It's all right. ",
        "\r\nCassie: No, it's not. If someone would have talked to me that way, I probably \r\nwould have punched them. ",
        "Beth: Don't think it didn't cross my mind. \r\n(Laughs) ",
        "Cassie: Maybe Tammy will listen to Lizzie. \r\nMaybe. ",
        "Beth: Friends are better than moms in some \r\nsituations. ",
        "Cassie: I never had that choice. Maybe that's \r\nwhy I feel so clueless. ",
        "\r\nBeth: Tammy will come around. You know Lizzie for all her faults; she can be a \r\ngood friend-- when she wants to be. ",
        "Olivia: And when would that be? Between \r\nstabbing you in the back and slitting your throat? ",
        "\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Tammy: The last thing I need right now is any \r\nmore drama. ",
        "Lizzie: Sometimes a little drama can be good.\r\n",
        "Tammy: I'm sorry, but coming from you, that \r\nscares me. ",
        "Lizzie: Okay, just give me a chance to \r\nexplain. ",
        "Tammy: I know I shouldn\u2019t. ",
        "Lizzie: But you will. ",
        "Tammy: I'll listen. ",
        "\r\nLizzie: Smart girl. Okay, the fact is, you did nothing wrong. The only one who's \r\nat fault here is your mother. ",
        "Tammy: Yeah, she messed up, all right. \n",
        "Lizzie: Now you're going to have to use it to \r\nyour advantage, though. ",
        "Tammy: This sounds sneaky. ",
        "Lizzie: Sneaky could be good, too. \n",
        "Tammy: How? ",
        "Lizzie: Okay, first you have to figure out \r\nwhat you want. ",
        "Tammy: What I want? ",
        "\r\nLizzie: Yep. The sky's the limit. Anything you want. You've got to make sure \r\nthat it's exactly what you want because you only get one shot, so it better be \r\ngood. ",
        "\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Beth: Olivia, you don't even know what we're \r\ntalking about. ",
        "Olivia: If Lizzie is involved, it can't be \r\ngood. ",
        "Cassie: What's going on? What are you doing \r\nhere? ",
        "Olivia: I came by to do some paperwork. What \r\nwere you talking about? ",
        "Cassie: Tammy is locked in her room and \r\nLizzie is trying to help her get out. ",
        "Olivia: Are you crazy? ",
        "Beth: This doesn't concern you. Why don't you \r\njust stay out of it? ",
        "\r\nOlivia: Cassie is my friend. If Tammy is in some kind of trouble and Lizzie is \r\ncounseling her, I'm going to say something. Sorry. ",
        "Beth: Lizzie and Tammy are friends. \n",
        "Olivia: I assume you use that term loosely.\r\n",
        "Cassie: Can we not, you know, make this \r\nmatter worse? ",
        "Beth: That would be difficult. ",
        "Cassie: Tammy and Lizzie are friends and \r\nLizzie is only trying to help. ",
        "\r\nOlivia: Look, with all due respect, Cass, as smart as you are, I have never \r\nunderstood how you could allow Tammy to hang out with Lizzie. ",
        "Beth: Enough with the Lizzie- bashing. \n",
        "Olivia: I'm just saying that I would never \r\nentrust my daughter's welfare to Lizzie. ",
        "Beth: You're overreacting and you're being \r\nridiculous. ",
        "\r\nOlivia: Really? Well, if Lizzie can be so erratic, behave so erratically with \r\nher own baby sister, what's to say she wouldn't do something worse to Tammy? \r\nHuh? ",
        "Cassie: I better go check. ",
        "Beth: Was that really necessary? ",
        "Olivia: I'm just one mom trying to help \r\nanother, Beth. (Cell phone rings) ",
        "Lizzie: Do you mind if I take this? \n",
        "Tammy: Okay. ",
        "\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Lizzie: Hey. ",
        "Joey: Hey. Tammy's not here? ",
        "Lizzie: Oh? ",
        "Joey: Where are you? ",
        "Lizzie: At the beacon. ",
        "Joey: Still? Is she with you? ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, but you're going to have to \r\nwait. Sorry. ",
        "\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Tammy: Who was that? ",
        "Lizzie: Uh, that was Nina. Boyfriend \r\ntroubles. So, where were we? ",
        "Tammy: We were sticking it to my mom. \n",
        "\r\nLizzie: Yes, we were. Okay, so you have to promise me you're not going to \r\nchicken out. Promise? ",
        "Tammy: Lizzie, I really don't think I can \r\npull this off. ",
        "Lizzie: Why? ",
        "Tammy: She's going to know that you put me up \r\nto it. ",
        "Lizzie: Oh, that's easy. One word, okay? \r\n\"Subtlety.\" You're an actress, you can do that. ",
        "Tammy: I don't even know what I'm supposed to \r\nbe acting. ",
