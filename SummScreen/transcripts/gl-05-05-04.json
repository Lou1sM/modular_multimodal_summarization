        "Harley tells Gus on the phone that he needs to turn down Alan's inheritance. Gus reluctantly goes along with it and tells Alan that. Alan tells him that he can't reverse it but maybe Gus will need the money someday. Harley wonders how Eden is involved with the Greens. Eden and Harley meet so that Eden can try on wedding dresses. Harley quizzes her about Paris, so Eden thinks Harley knows everything. She spills it all to Harley that Salerno was obsessed with her and kept her as his \"toy\". Brad Green used to hit on her and she got the idea of starting the escort service from how he acted with her. Harley feels great sympathy to Eden's plight and wants to help her, but Eden doesn't want to risk Harley being endangered from Salerno, too. Eden hopes that she is able to marry Bill but fears the future; she asks Harley not to tell Bill. Later, Harley is trying on wedding dresses, too, when Gus comes in. He is glad to see them getting along. Harley asks Eden to tell Gus about Salerno, but she won't.",
        "At the Beacon, Tammy won't come out of her room. Edmund and Cassie try to get her out by first talking to her, then cutting off her phone and electricity. Joey puts a ladder to her window and climbs up. She feels better after talking to him. He sings his song to her. Cassie gets Edmund to open the door, but Tammy is gone. She comes in behind them and says she's going to school. Cassie is annoyed and lectures her. Olivia is concerned about Philip and begs Rick to tell her what's going on with his treatment, but Rick won't tell her. She leaves the baby with Philip, who in turn lets Lizzie hold her, so Olivia freaks out and takes the baby back. There is tension between Philip and Olivia about that; Olivia tells him that Lizzie will not get near her daughter. Gus poses undercover as a drug dealer but gets busted by cops. Frank is called and he yells at Gus for doing police work on his own. Gus explains he's trying to figure out where the drugs at Spaulding came from, so Frank agrees to let him work with them."

        "Gus: I... I don't think I can go through with it.",
        "Harley: Honey, we talked about this. You say, \"Alan thanks, but no thanks. I couldn't possibly accept the money.\"",
        "Gus: Honey, did you see on the table this morning? Did you see we got a bill from the mechanic?",
        "Harley: I saw it.",
        "Gus: Okay, well, what if Zach and Jude, what if they need braces, you know, down the road?",
        "Harley: I think their fathers can help pay for that.",
        "Gus: I'm just saying. I'm just saying.",
        "Harley: Look, honey, if you don't want to say no to Alan, then don't say no, okay? I'm just telling you that that money comes with strings attached; long, tangled, knotty strings. You're new to the whole Spaulding thing, remember? I have lived through this nightmare-- more than once.",
        "Gus: All right. \"Thanks, but no thanks, Alan. I just... I cannot accept this money.\"",
        "Harley: That's what I'm talking about.",
        "Gus: Done. Hey, Alan. Thank you very much for coming down this morning.",
        "Alan: Well, you know, I'm not the one who wanted to create this distance between us in the first place.",
        "Gus: Well, I think we both had a hand in that, right? Here we are.",
        "Alan: Well, what is it you wanted to see me about?",
        "Gus: Alan, thanks, but no thanks. Look, it's about the inheritance, right? I can't accept it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Wait a minute. We cannot discount the fact that Eden might be involved in this somehow.",
        "Harley: Yeah. No, I thought of that, but I really think she was just Vinnie's arm candy.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you know what? You're going to find out. You're going to find that out and you're going to find a lot more out.",
        "Harley: But, wait a minute. Now, why do I have to find that out?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, who else is going to investigate?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eden: Hey, sis.",
        "Harley: Sis?",
        "Eden: What? Too much?",
        "Harley: A bit.",
        "Eden: Well, once you and my brother set a date...",
        "Harley: Yes, once we do, then you and I can have that kind of conversation. What did you do, rob a bridal shop?",
        "Eden: I borrowed a bridal shop, and I knew I could count on my maid of honor to give me her honest opinion. I mean, you're nothing if not honest.",
        "Harley: That's me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Let me give it a shot, all right? (Whispers)",
        "Cassie: Good luck.",
        "Edmund: Thank you, thank you. Tammy? I brought you some breakfast.",
        "Tammy: I'm not hungry.",
        "Edmund: Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.",
        "Tammy: Then you eat it.",
        "Edmund: All right, all right. Let's start this over again. Tammy, I'm not going to beg you to come out. I think you know how sorry I am about our misunderstanding. I just want you to know that you're very much missed out here, on this side of the door.",
        "Tammy: Don't try to be nice, okay, because I'm not coming out. I'm not going to school. I'm going to miss all my classes and flunk out and live the rest of my life in shame.",
        "Cassie: You taught her to be dramatic.",
        "Edmund: All right, all right, all right. Tammy, if you want to play it that way, that's fine. You can always... you can start over later in life. As I did. Hey, look at me now. I play hide-and-seek. I read bedtime stories. I go to high school plays. I bring your mother home flowers whenever I screw up. She's a florist at this point. And thanks to you and your mom and your brothers, I think I have a good idea of what it means to be a part of a family now, so maybe you're just... you're just teaching me another lesson, right? The problem is, Tammy, we can't be a family without you. So, maybe if you came out here...",
        "Tammy: Yeah, nice try.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Looking good, buddy. Looking real good.",
        "Phillip: That's because I'm stress-free. Thanks to my incredible wife.",
        "Rick: Ah. Nice work, Olivia. Listen, I'm going to check with you later, okay?",
        "Phillip: Okay.",
        "Olivia: You know what? I just want to talk to Rick for a minute. Would you hold her?",
        "Phillip: Yeah. Come here, you. Come here. Yeah, you do that.",
        "Olivia: What's really going on?",
        "Rick: What are you talking about?",
        "Olivia: Come on. Ever since you came to see Alan at the house, nurses have been whispering in corners. Huge chunks of Phillip's schedule can't be accounted for. His mood improvement, making plans for the future.",
        "Rick: Olivia, we've been through this, haven't we?",
        "Olivia: We're going to keep going through it until you give me a straight answer. If there has been a change in my husband's treatment, I have a right to know and I'm going to find out, whether you like it or not.",
        "Olivia: Rick, please.",
        "Rick: Look, Olivia, you need to talk to Phillip about his treatment.",
        "Olivia: Talk to Phillip.",
        "Rick: That's right.",
        "Olivia: He's sick. He can't possibly know what's best for him.",
        "Rick: But he was in his right mind when he married you, wasn't he?",
        "Olivia: According to his last doctor, yes. But that doesn't mean he doesn't have moments of confusion, or else why would he still be here?",
        "Rick: Look, all I can do at this point is tell you to look at the bright side. You said it yourself: His mood's improving; he's making plans for his life. He's getting better every day, isn't he?",
        "Olivia: Please. Look, I know you don't like me very much right now, and I know this is hard to believe, but I actually do care very much for Phillip's health and my marriage.",
        "Rick: Well, I'm glad. That's the way it should be, shouldn't it? The fact of the matter is, you guys have had problems from the very beginning. Maybe you should think about getting some therapy.",
        "Olivia: Right. Yeah, well, it's done wonders for Lizzie, hasn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: You're so strong.",
        "Lizzie: Hi, daddy.",
        "Phillip: Hi, sweetheart.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, hi.",
        "Phillip: I'm just spending some time with my other little girl here.",
        "Lizzie: Hi, Emma.",
        "Phillip: How are you doing?",
        "Lizzie: It's good to see you, too.",
        "Phillip: Well, you two must be seeing a lot of each other now, being under the same roof.",
        "Lizzie: No, actually, Olivia keeps her under lock and key, so I hardly ever see her.",
        "Phillip: Really? Huh. Well... (Baby fussing) how would you like to hold her now?",
        "Lizzie: What about Olivia?",
        "Phillip: What about her?",
        "Lizzie: Well, hello, beautiful. Hi. It's okay. I'm your sister. Yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Let's give her ten minutes and try again.",
        "Cassie: Ten minutes isn't going to do anything. She's not coming out of that room.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I've led armies. I'm not about to be outwitted by your teenage daughter.",
        "Cassie: Leading an army and raising a teenage daughter, they're two very different things, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: No, because they're both rooted in rebellion.",
        "Cassie: Okay. I'm listening.",
        "Edmund: Okay. What we've got is a classic hostage situation. Tammy, the bad, is holding Tammy, the good hostage, locked in her own room, a prisoner of her own emotions. What we have to do is rescue her.",
        "Cassie: Granted, Edmund, I am at my wit's end with Tammy, but I don't understand what you're talking about.",
        "Edmund: I can negotiate with Tammy the bad to let Tammy the good... I can get Tammy out of there.",
        "Cassie: Tell me what you have in mind.",
        "Edmund: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Well, the \"I's\" are dotted, the \"T's\" are crossed. Gus, I don't see the problem here.",
        "Gus: The problem... the problem is, Alan, I can't accept it. Offering me an inheritance, is very generous, incredibly generous.",
        "Alan: Incredibly, but...",
        "Gus: But. Money... money changes things.",
        "Alan: Yes, it does, son. Yes.",
        "Gus: Yes, and Harley and I like things the way they are.",
        "Alan: While it's true money can't buy happiness, it can certainly buy you a lot of options. So, why don't you just give this a little more time and think it over, huh?",
        "Gus: I have thought about it and the answer is still no.",
        "Alan: I respect your decision. I just hope that you didn't think I was trying to buy your affection.",
        "Gus: You already have that.",
        "Alan: There is one problem, though, Gus. This trust can't be undone. Now, you can ignore this if you want to, but it's not going to go away. Who knows? Maybe someday the IRS will come knocking at your door and you'll need some petty cash. You'll thank me then.",
        "Gus: This coming from the guy with the feds all over him. It's funny. Are they still at Spaulding?",
        "Alan: Well, they've questioned all the employees, gone through our records, our files and they still can't find the drug connection.",
        "Gus: Well, try not to worry about it so much. I'm working on a little something on my end.",
        "Alan: What are you working on?",
        "Gus: It's nothing I can't handle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eden: Look at us, surrounded by silk and taffeta, bonding like a couple of girly girls. Who would have thought we would be here now, back when you dragged me into town in handcuffs?",
        "Harley: Are we about to have a warm, fuzzy moment?",
        "Eden: Harley, I'm sorry. I... I am sorry for every time I felt jealous of you or threatened by you. I know now that we weren't in competition for Nicky's attention. He has plenty to go around. And I don't know if my apology means anything to you now, it's so overdue.",
        "Harley: It means something.",
        "Eden: Okay. Enough of the fuzzy moment. Um, try this.",
        "Harley: Me? No, no, no, no. I'm just the bridesmaid here.",
        "Eden: You are getting married, too.",
        "Harley: No, no, no.",
        "Eden: And... (Shrieks) you should try this on.",
        "Harley: No, no, no. Because that's very white and that is very fluffy.",
        "Eden: Oh. You are afraid to show the softer side of Harley cooper?",
        "Harley: No, no, no. I'll try on every dress on that rack, just as long as I get to keep my pistol tucked inside my garter. Wait, let me ask you something. I don't understand, why are you limiting yourself to just local bridal shops in Springfield? Why don't you go to Milan or, I don't know, Paris? You know, you could jet off this European thing. You could hook up with Marah.",
        "Eden: You know, Bill knew what I was doing today, and he made sure to remind me that it's not the dress, that it's the girl who wears it.",
        "Harley: Aw.",
        "Eden: I guess it's his way of keeping me close to home.",
        "Harley: (Laughs) that's okay. I never saw you as much of a world traveler anyway. It's just funny because Marie green said the craziest thing. She said something about you being in Paris with Vinnie Salerno. Isn't that crazy? I mean, it doesn't even make sense. Why would you be in Paris with Vinnie Salerno?",
        "Eden: Why would you ask me that?",
        "Harley: Just a hypothetical.",
        "Eden: But why? Why would you even bring up his name?",
        "Harley: I don't know unless there's something to it. Is there something to it?",
        "Eden: God. You know, don't you? You figured it out. You know.",
        "Harley: What exactly have I figured out, Eden?",
        "Eden: If I tell you, you'll let it go, and I mean drop it forever.",
        "Harley: I'm not on the force anymore. I'm not in a position to grant you some sort of immunity.",
        "Eden: Hey, I was legal then.",
        "Harley: Are we talking about the same thing here?",
        "Eden: Salerno. He was in love with me and obsessed with me. He had a thing for toys. You know, race cars, speedboats. I used to tell people we were in business together. But the truth is, I was just his favorite toy. Bill doesn't know anything about this, and Nicky found out but I passed it off as a quickie fling.",
        "Harley: What does that have to do with you and Brad Green in Paris? His wife seems to think you two had a thing.",
        "Eden: Vinnie, he would have killed both of us if we had. But that didn't stop brad from hitting on me. I told him how dangerous it was and he... that just encouraged him. That's how I got the idea for the Garden of Eden, Harley.",
        "Harley: Connect the dots for me.",
        "Eden: (Sighs) I started the escort service because I figured out if there was one stupid rich guy like brad out there who was willing to risk it all for a little action, that there had to be more. Nice, right?",
        "Harley: Well, we all screw up, Eden. It's not a perfect world.",
        "Eden: No kidding. (Sniffles) no father, no brother. Just a mobster boyfriend who terrorized me. I did what I had to survive until I could get away from him. And I got away from him, Harley. I got away from him. You can't tell bill or Gus. Please. Please, don't tell them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Drug dealer: You waiting on the \"D\" train?",
        "Gus: Who's asking?",
        "Drug dealer: The guy driving it into the station.",
        "Gus: Where's the other guy? I don't like dealing with strangers.",
        "Drug dealer: He sent me. You want the stuff or not?",
        "Gus: Whoa, what is this? This is not the deal.",
        "Cop: Freeze! (Men fighting) Hey, I know you. Freeze.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: First, we cut off the enemy's supply line.",
        "Cassie: Can we not call her \"the enemy,\" please?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, you're either with me or against me.",
        "Cassie: Edmund. Okay, I'm with you.",
        "Edmund: Good. Put the breakfast over there. She had her chance.",
        "Cassie: All right. What next?",
        "Edmund: We destroy her communication infrastructure.",
        "Cassie: Can't you just say, \"We cut off her phone?\"",
        "Edmund: Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Okay, fine. I'll have her phone line disconnected.",
        "Edmund: Thank you.",
        "Cassie: But she has her cell phone with her. And her computer.",
        "Edmund: You see, I saw her charger on your desk this morning. I give her cell phone a few hours, tops. As for the rest, we kill the electricity.",
        "Cassie: I like that.",
        "Edmund: I'm good.",
        "Cassie: Okay. All right. I hope it works, I hope it works. Stan, it's Cassie. I need you to cut the electricity to my daughter's room. And the phone line. No, just in Tammy's room. Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Mm-hmm. All right. Now what?",
        "Edmund: We wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Lizzie? Hey, it's me. Okay, I am playing this just like you told me to, but my mom's starting to get really ticked off. So just call me back when you get this and remind me why I'm doing this in the first place. Mom? Mom, are you out there?",
        "Cassie: Sounds like confusion to me.",
        "Edmund: Go ahead, humor her.",
        "Cassie: Uh, yeah. Yeah, Tammy, what's up?",
        "Tammy: Is everything okay out there?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, everything's great. Why?",
        "Tammy: Because everything just went dead in my room.",
        "Cassie: Really? Well, hm. I'll have to look into that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: Hey, Tammy. Are you out here?",
        "Tammy: Joey? Joey? What are you doing down there?",
        "Joey: You weren't in homeroom, so...",
        "Tammy: I'm home sick.",
        "Joey: Lizzie said you had a fight with your uncle.",
        "Tammy: What, is she telling the whole world?",
        "Joey: No, but I think I just did. So, are you coming down?",
        "Tammy: No, not right now.",
        "Joey: All right, then I'm coming up.",
        "Tammy: No, no. Oh. Stop it. Stay. No, no, no. No, this is not...",
        "Joey: How \"Romeo and Juliet\" is this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: Are you two talking about me again?",
        "Olivia: Where's the baby... do you see what I'm talking about?",
        "Lizzie: Yes. I'm going to be the best big sister ever! Uh-huh. Oh, hi Olivia.",
        "Olivia: Lizzie, give her to me. (Baby fussing)",
        "Lizzie: But we were getting along so well.",
        "Olivia: Just, please, give her to me.",
        "Lizzie: She really does have my eyes.",
        "Olivia: Come here. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, it's okay.",
        "Lizzie: What did I do wrong? I was gentle and I supported her head, like you said.",
        "Olivia: Lizzie, it's not what you did. It's what you've done up until now.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, well, you know what? I'm trying hard. Why do you always have to think the worst of me?",
        "Olivia: Because you usually live up to my expectations.",
        "Lizzie: See? Look at that. Why am I even trying? It doesn't even matter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: Yeah, it matters. I know that you've worked very hard to get better, and I'm very proud of you. That was uncalled for.",
        "Olivia: I'm sorry you feel that way.",
        "Phillip: Well, so who does get to hold the baby? Does my best friend Rick pass inspection? What about me? Can I hold my own child?",
        "Olivia: Yeah. Of course you can.",
        "Phillip: Oh, good. Okay. I just wanted to know.",
        "Olivia: I'm not going to argue anymore. I'm not going to argue anymore.",
        "Phillip: No, I know, honey. I just want to learn the rules, that's all.",
        "Olivia: Not in front of the baby.",
        "Phillip: Thank you, sweetie. I know. You know, she's so lucky. She's got so many people that love her. I love you. Your big sister Lizzie loves you. Hey, you know what? Big sisters make the best baby- sitters. Maybe we can work our way up to that.",
        "Lizzie: Well, only if you both trust me.",
        "Phillip: Yeah. Soon. Very soon.",
        "Phillip: Yeah. How about this? Do we look like a family? Does this look like progress to you, or what?",
        "Rick: It doesn't matter what I think, pal. It's what you think that counts.",
        "Olivia: I think it's time for Emma's nap. Come here, sweetheart.",
        "Phillip: There you go. Go to mommy.",
        "Olivia: Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I'M... you know, I better get to school, too. Homeroom's almost over and I've got this big math test today.",
        "Rick: Okay. You want a lift to school?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, you know what? That's okay. Bruno's waiting outside.",
        "Phillip: Don't worry about it. First-time mothers, you know.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: I'm sorry, Brandon. I'm sorry. You were just about to blow my cover.",
        "Cop: But you don't work vice, detective. I saw you make that buy.",
        "Frank: Okay, what's going on here? I got your call. Who was resisting arrest?",
        "Cop: One of our own, chief.",
        "Frank: What? All right, Brandon, I'll handle this, thanks. Okay, Aitoro, what's going on?",
        "Gus: I'm working undercover, Frank.",
        "Frank: Not for me, you're not.",
        "Gus: All right, look. You know that the feds are investigating Spaulding, right? The whole delirium thing.",
        "Frank: Go on.",
        "Gus: Well, they're starting at the top. I figured I'd start at the bottom.",
        "Frank: You're doing what? What, are you out of your mind? What, are you some kind of vigilante now?",
        "Gus: Please.",
        "Frank: Your face was all over the newspapers when you first signed up with Spaulding. You're very lucky somebody didn't recognize you. Not to mention blowing the cover of other operatives.",
        "Gus: Frank, come on. You don't have any other operatives working on this thing.",
        "Frank: How do you know that? Listen, you're not the one running this department.",
        "Gus: Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm looking for answers, you know?",
        "Frank: No, what you're looking to do is protect your family business, and this is not the job to do that.",
        "Gus: Frank, there is a drug war brewing out there, okay? This whole town is in play. And my family's involved. I'm sorry. So what? I have been making a lot of contacts and connections. I've been laying a lot of groundwork.",
        "Frank: You know what? You can just forget it.",
        "Gus: No, Frank, I'M... I'm knowing the players now. Okay? I've got weeks and weeks invested in the field. Use me. That's all I'm saying. Use me. Okay? I get results, you know I do.",
        "Frank: I want a full report of everything that you've done. I want names, I want connections, and I want everything you've bought.",
        "Gus: Okay, you've got it.",
        "Frank: I want it on my desk today.",
        "Gus: Done. Done. Done.",
        "Frank: And then I'm going to look over it and I'm going to see if vice will find anything interesting about it and then see if we can open up an official investigation.",
        "Gus: That's... frank, you're making the right decision, okay, and you can count on me. You can count on me.",
        "Frank: Aitoro, you are not a vice detective. And I do not want my sister to be a widow before you've even bothered to make her a bride. Now, if I sense that you're in over your head, I'm going to yank you off this case. Do you understand me?",
        "Gus: Fair enough. Fair enough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Life is not fair, Eden.",
        "Eden: That's all you've got?",
        "Harley: Well, I... I don't know, if you're sitting here expecting me to judge you. I'm not going to do it, and I'm not going to make your business everybody else's business in town. I won't do that, either.",
        "Eden: Thank you, Harley.",
        "Harley: You know, when I was 16, I was giving birth in the back seat of a car. It took me a long time to get where I am today, so I know what it's like to have to fight for what you want.",
        "Eden: I'm tired of fighting, Harley. I just want to be with bill. I want a real future. And it just seems like it's too good to be true. Maybe it is.",
        "Harley: Why would you say that?",
        "Eden: I don't know.",
        "Harley: Eden, if you're having any problems with Salerno, I wish you'd tell me. You don't have to stand up to him alone.",
        "Eden: Harley, Vinnie gets what Vinnie wants. If he does not want me to marry Bill, that's what will happen, all right?",
        "Harley: Okay. Let me help you.",
        "Eden: We're finally getting along. I'm not going to put you in danger.",
        "Harley: Your life is in danger?",
        "Eden: No, I am fine. I'm just going to lay low and I am going to hope that Vinnie forgets about me, okay?",
        "Harley: Eden, don't do this alone. Please.",
        "Eden: (Sighs) okay. Um, I'M... this is a mood- killer, okay? So, we're clinging on to the past when today is just supposed to be all about my future. So why don't we just try on some dresses and see what the future looks like, okay?",

        "Tammy: Joey, you are crazy.",
        "Joey: You wouldn't come down, so can you help me over?",
        "Tammy: No, no, no, no. You can't come up here. If my mom found you here, she would kill me. I'm already in enough trouble.",
        "Joey: Whatever. So, are you going to tell me what happened with your uncle?",
        "Tammy: Uncle Edmund is the least of my problems right now. It's my mom. She's been spying on me. She even read my journal.",
        "Joey: So? They all do that. It's a mom thing. I'm serious. My mom raids my sock drawer every Sunday after church. Says she's \"folding laundry.\"",
        "Tammy: My mom doesn't know how good she has it with me. I'm like a parent's dream come true. You know what? I am sick of being a good girl all the time.",
        "Joey: Uh, Tammy? We both have juvenile records.",
        "Tammy: I'm not saying that I never screwed up. But you know what I mean. I just... I'm tired of trying so hard. My mom does whatever she wants and she is still saint Cassie. I do one little thing, and it's like the end of the world.",
        "Joey: You going to tell me what you did?",
        "Tammy: What?",
        "Joey: Well, you said you did one little thing. What was it?",
        "Tammy: You know, now that you're here, it doesn't seem like it's that big of a deal anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: There's still no answer.",
        "Edmund: Give her time.",
        "Cassie: No. My mommy alert is going off. It's too quiet in there. You've got to get me in this door, Edmund, now.",
        "Edmund: Are you saying you want to storm the barricade?",
        "Cassie: Quit with the code talk.",
        "Edmund: All right, I'll pick the lock.",

        "Harley: I look like little Bo Peep.",
        "Eden: Stop it. You look fabulous.",
        "Harley: No, I'm serious. I mean, you give me a flock; I'm like a walking nursery rhyme here. As compared to you, who looks like A...",
        "Eden: Yeah, it's pretty hot, but it doesn't scream \"Mrs. Bill lewis.\"",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Eden: Help me find something more tasteful.",
        "Harley: Yeah. Why don't you try... here, this.",
        "Eden: See? I knew you could give me something great. I'll be right back.",

        "Gus: No, just let me see. Let me see. Hm. Hm.",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Gus: I just feel bad, you know? You lost your sheep and everything.",
        "Harley: Shut up.",
        "Gus: You look... you look nice.",
        "Harley: No, I was thinking the same... it's fluffy.",
        "Gus: No. No, I could see us... I could see us doing this. Someday. I just think you look really... I just think you look really nice. I get it. I see how... I get it now.",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Gus: Just why women get all crazy with the whole planning the wedding stuff and everything, because I look at you like this and I think, you know, I want to protect you for the rest of my natural life.",
        "Harley: Sounds like a plan.",
        "Gus: Oh, wait, is this where I get to... now I can kiss the bride?",
        "Harley: Now I get to kiss you.",

        "Edmund: I am working as fast as I can.",
        "Cassie: Well, kick the door down.",
        "Edmund: That only works on television. Besides, I know the owner of this hotel.",
        "Cassie: Would you please come on. Hurry up, hurry up.",
        "Edmund: All right, okay, okay.",

        "Joey: I thought maybe I would sing for you.",
        "Tammy: Sing?",
        "Joey: Yeah.",
        "Tammy: That song I missed at the party? You mean, like, right now?",
        "Joey: It's a little bit funny this feeling inside. I'm not one of those who can easily hide. I don't have much money if I did I'd buy a big house where we both could live in. You can tell everybody this is your song. It may be quite simple but, now that it's done I hope you don't mind that I put down in words.",
        "Tammy: Joey, that was beautiful.",
        "Joey: We need to get out of here.",
        "Tammy: Yeah.",

        "Gus: Oh, for the... um. Interesting, I guess. Yeah.",
        "Harley: Yeah, I'd go with interesting.",
        "Eden: Yeah. It's not the right one. Respectable, yes, but boring.",
        "Harley: Hmm-mm.",
        "Gus: Yeah?",

        "Harley: Well, we had a very nice morning.",
        "Eden: Mm-hmm.",
        "Harley: Actually, I was just telling Eden how lucky she is to have a brother like you. You know, somebody who would be willing to help you fight your battles.",
        "Gus: Which battles are those?",
        "Eden: No battles. Just girl talk.",
        "Gus: Oh, yeah, I get it. It's like the sister secret ya- ya-ya-hood code. You know? It's that thing?",
        "Eden: No, no, no, no. No ya-ya secret. No, no.",
        "Gus: Yeah, well, that's better anyway, because, you know, secrets, they're not always the best idea.",
        "Harley: Unless the secret is absolutely unavoidable.",
        "Eden: That doesn't happen very often.",
        "Gus: Right.",

        "Cassie: Joey? You know what, Tammy? You're not going anywhere until you understand that your actions have consequences to them. This hotel is your home, Tammy, and as long as you live here with me, you're not going to lock me out of any part of it-- ever. Do you understand me.",
        "Tammy: Uh-huh. Can I go now?",
        "Cassie: No, you can't.",
        "Tammy: What are you going to do, lock me in my room?",
        "Cassie: You're pushing it, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: Well, I'm going to be late.",
        "Cassie: For what?",
        "Tammy: School. I already missed homeroom, but I can still make it in time for my math test.",

        "Edmund: Yeah. Well, I for one, I think you're a terrific mother, Cassie. I am going to stick to rebel armies and leave the teenagers to you.",
        "Cassie: I don't think so. We're in this together.",
        "Tammy: That was the coolest thing ever, the look on my mom's face.",
        "Lizzie: Tammy. What are you doing outside of your room? I thought we had a plan.",
        "Tammy: We did. And it worked great. Then Joey talked me out of my funk. Thanks anyway. Hey, aren't you going to school? We have that math test.",

        "Olivia: How dare you?",
        "Phillip: How dare I what?",
        "Olivia: You know that I don't want Lizzie alone with the baby. How could you put Emma at risk like that?",
        "Phillip: At risk? Don't you think you're exaggerating just a little bit?",
        "Olivia: No, I don't. You are putting our daughter at risk, Phillip, by asking Lizzie to handle jealousies and emotions she's not equipped for.",
        "Phillip: Olivia, are you angry?",
        "Olivia: Listen, you talk about baby-sitting? I have to tell you, hell will have to freeze over and pigs will have to fly before I ever let her baby-sit our daughter.",
        "Phillip: Olivia, Lizzie is an enormous part of my life and she always will be. Didn't you think all that through before you arranged for us to be married?",
        "Olivia: Well, I married you, not your daughter.",
        "Rick: Hey, buddy, listen. I'm headed home. Just try to get some rest, okay?",
        "Phillip: Mm. Okay.",
        "Olivia: I know you're up to something, and whatever it is, I'll find out.",
        "Phillip: Honey, I don't know what you're talking about, but I wish you wouldn't get so upset because I'm getting worried about you and I think Rick is, too.",
        "Olivia: Is this really how you want to play this, Phillip? Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Next, on \"guiding light.\"",
        "Olivia: It was my fault, all right? I provoked him.",
        "Rick: You're telling me Phillip did this to you.",
        "Olivia: He didn't mean to hurt me, Rick. I know that in my heart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: You need to grow up, Bill, because life is a lot harder and I am not that person.",
        "Bill: Oh, that's too bad, because I liked her.",
