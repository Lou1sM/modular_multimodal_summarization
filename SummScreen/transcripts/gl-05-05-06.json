        "Mel: It's got everything you need to know, Lizzie, right down to the date of conception. Okay?",
        "Coop: Thank you very much, ma'am.",
        "Mel: No, problem. Take care.",
        "Coop: Yup. Lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: What?",
        "Coop: Whoa, I guess I'm just surprised at how much information we can get so quickly. Can I see it?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, God, the baby!",
        "Coop: Whoa, whoa. Take it easy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: I don't even know what I'm looking for. Hell, whatever Lizzie is making up about her pregnancy probably has nothing to do with me, right? Right. So the quicker I find out, the quicker I can move on and put it out of my mind. Move on with Tammy. That's all I want. I don't think I'm asking for too much.",
        "Ashlee: Hey, Nate. What are you looking for? Maybe I can help you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I know it's a pain, but Mr. Lewis needs those numbers by noon at the latest on Monday because we need to turn them around and submit them to the state by 5:00 P.M.",
        "Tammy: Mom?",
        "Cassie: Would that be a doable at your end? Great. Thank you. Perfect. Bye. Hi.",
        "Tammy: Oh. For a minute there, I thought you were...",
        "Cassie: Talking to myself?",
        "Tammy: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: It's not. I've just become completely high-tech and wireless ever since I began working on this project with Josh. It's amazing. You know, I can now officially do 17 things at once.",
        "Tammy: Ooh. Well, I hope that one of those things might include coming to my parent/student dinner tonight.",
        "Cassie: What parent/student dinner thing? You didn't tell me about a parent/student dinner thing.",
        "Tammy: I didn't?",
        "Cassie: No.",
        "Tammy: Are you sure? I could swear that I... shoot. Well, it's tonight at Outskirts at 9:00 P.M.",
        "Cassie: A parent/student dinner at Outskirts?",
        "Tammy: Why not? More business for Jonathan. So can you make it? Please.",
        "Cassie: Well, look at that. Apparently I can. This thing is so cool, I'm just going to put you in here right now.",
        "Tammy: Well, great. Great. Mom, wear that new dress that we got, the one that we got together-- and those cute shoes, okay? Are you listening?",
        "Cassie: Uh-huh.",
        "Tammy: Because you never know who you might meet. The world is full of great, nice, eligible guys.",
        "Cassie: Tammy Winslow, do you think I don't know what you're doing here? You know, I realize you're hoping if I meet a new man that I'll become so busy I don't have time to keep tabs on you and Jonathan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: The stitches and the lump is gone, and that's it, no big deal.",
        "Josh: George, that is great. Thank you so much. Give my love to your wife, okay? Thank you, I appreciate it. Bye-bye. The governor is on board with our project. He has got a son serving overseas right now and he has agreed to lend his name to our fundraising efforts.",
        "Reva: That is terrific. And I am so proud of you.",
        "Josh: Proud of us, is what is you really mean, right? Because I couldn't possibly be doing any of this without you, Reva. Fulfilling my father's dream and having you by my side, life just doesn't get much better than this.",
        "Reva: No, it doesn't.",
        "Josh: And I promise you we'll have more fun collaborating on this project than we have since, well, conceiving Marah and Shayne.",
        "Reva: I love you. And I love that you're so happy. It makes it all worthwhile.",
        "Josh: Makes what worthwhile?",
        "Reva: Everything. Everything we've had to do to get here. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Josh: Are you going to see who that is?",
        "Reva: Unavailable. Must be wrong number.",
        "Josh: You're getting a lot of those lately...",
        "Reva: No, no, no. Oh, besides, you're going to have to answer that. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Josh: Yes, I am. Sorry about that. Hello? Yeah, I do. I'll be right back. I have it in the other room. Just a second.",
        "Reva: What do you want?",
        "Colin: Reva Lewis, please?",
        "Reva: Don't you believe in leaving messages, Dr. McCabe?",
        "Colin: Mrs. Lewis?",
        "Reva: You know who the hell this is, and I know who you are too, because your name keeps popping up on my caller I.D. every ten minutes.",
        "Colin: Okay, you need to come into my office ASAP so we can go over your treatment options. Time has gone by since...",
        "Reva: I can't talk to you right now.",
        "Josh: So who was it?",
        "Reva: A telemarketer. Can you believe that they're calling cell phones now?",
        "Josh: Well, I hope you hung up on him?",
        "Reva: Actually, I told him that all that matters to me is my fantastic husband and making all of his dreams come true.",
        "Josh: Okay, I think that's... oh, thank you very much. I'm just going to take care of a couple of things at the office and I'll be back as quick as I can.",
        "Reva: Okay. Don't rush. I'll be holding down the fort.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Reva: I can't believe how excited you are about this project-- I mean, I can believe it, but I haven't seen you this excited about anything in a very long time.",
        "Josh: I'm so glad to be doing something important, something that will make a difference in people's lives. I mean, these soldiers that come home, they're so young, they've made incredible sacrifices. You know what else I was thinking?",
        "Reva: What?",
        "Josh: Maybe Shayne will come home and help us with this. I mean, I was just thinking about what he went through to walk again after his accident.",
        "Reva: I would love that. I miss my baby boy.",
        "Josh: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Reva: You know what else?",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Reva: Maybe Marah could come home to design the nurses' uniforms.",
        "Josh: Mara designing nurses uniforms. That's a scary thought, but that could work. That could work. It could be the ultimate Lewis family project.",
        "Reva: Yep.",
        "Josh: This is going to be a really good year, Reva. I know it. I can feel it in my heart. Okay, okay, what's that? What's wrong?",
        "Reva: Nothing, nothing's wrong. It's just all so wonderful, and so are you.",
        "Josh: That's a good thing.",
        "Reva: Yeah.",
        "Josh: Your phone, it's shimmying.",
        "Reva: It's okay.",
        "Josh: Wait, wait, wait. I'll be back as quick as I can.",
        "Reva: Oh, okay. Bud?",
        "Josh: Yes?",
        "Reva: I love you.",
        "Josh: I love you, too. ( Door shuts )",
        "Reva: I told you, Dr. McCabe...",
        "Colin: When you get a direct call from me, it's because it's urgent.",
        "Reva: And I'm so honored. But as I said, I'm busy. You took the lump out, and you said it hasn't spread.",
        "Colin: That's not the end of it.",
        "Reva: A couple of more months. You know, just until things calm down. What's a couple more months?",
        "Colin: Well, it could be the difference between life and death. Look, Mrs. Lewis, this is the last call I'm going to make. If you're not going to take responsibility for your own care, then I'll have done all I can do as your physician. You'll no longer be my patient or my responsibility.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Don't give me that stunned, \"I never thought of such a thing\" look.",
        "Tammy: Fine, you win. All right, maybe I do want to keep you so busy you don't have time to be my freaked-out, overprotective mom.",
        "Cassie: Thanks.",
        "Tammy: And I want you to start dating again, Mom. You deserve a guy treating you right and adoring you.",
        "Cassie: Honey, you're in love. You want everybody else to be in love. I remember that feeling. It's beautiful. And it is also very annoying to everyone else.",
        "Tammy: Too bad.",
        "Cassie: And, you know, there is something else you should understand about this, honey. I had you when I was very, very young, right? And I've pretty much gone from one relationship to the next since then. And now for the first time in my life, I'm not looking to do that. So the bottom line is I'm good. You can back off.",
        "Tammy: You sure?",
        "Cassie: Absolutely.",
        "Tammy: Just you and your gadgets?",
        "Cassie: And R.J., and visiting Will and helping Josh with the project. These are all things that really matter to me and things that challenge me and fulfill me.",
        "Tammy: How very evolved of you.",
        "Cassie: Thank you. And did I mention, keeping tabs on you and Jonathan and making your life a living hell? Just kidding. Besides, what would I have to bug you guys about these days? You guys seem very happy, and Jonathan even seems like the model citizen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Ashlee, hey, I was looking for you.",
        "Ashlee: Yeah, sure. I was wondering how I lost these.",
        "Jonathan: Well, you left them on the table where we had had coffee, and I was going to give them back to you, but...",
        "Ashlee: Yeah, yeah, so you come to give them back to me, and you just walk in here and look through patient files. You've been a bad boy, Nate. I could call the cops right now and have you arrested.",
        "Jonathan: You could, but you won't. Because that is not cool.",
        "Ashlee: Lizzie Spaulding again. What is your obsession with her? And don't deny it.",
        "Jonathan: No, I do have a thing with Lizzie. Like a while back she pulled something really low on me, and now I'm looking to get some dirt on her so I can pay her back.",
        "Ashlee: Did you guys, like, go out or something?",
        "Jonathan: No. The girl is not my type. The chick is warped and totally mean. You saw how she blew you off the other day.",
        "Ashlee: She had a good reason.",
        "Jonathan: Ash, come on. Don't cut her any slack. I've seen the way she treats you. You don't deserve that. When I pay her back, I'll be doing it for you, too. I just need something on her.",
        "Ashlee: I have something.",
        "Jonathan: You do? What?",
        "Ashlee: I guess I can tell you if...",
        "Jonathan: If?",
        "Ashlee: First, can you do something for me?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah.",
        "Ashlee: Great, great. Okay. So, um... 9:00 P.M., Main Street. Oh, oh, and wear a tux.",
        "Jonathan: A tux?",
        "Ashlee: Yeah.",
        "Jonathan: Why?",
        "Ashlee: You'll see when you get there. You're going to look so hot. I can't believe things are going to work out so well.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Oh!",
        "Coop: What is it? Is something wrong with the baby?",
        "Lizzie: I don't know. I hope not.",
        "Mel: Sit down here. Sit her down here. How intense is the pain, Lizzie? Describe it to me. Is it short or what?",
        "Lizzie: I guess it's not that intense, really. It's kind of going away.",
        "Coop: What?",
        "Lizzie: It's gone. Oh, my gosh. This is really embarrassing. I think that it's something I ate. I ate a really big lunch. You told me to eat for two, and so I had two of everything. I think I overdid it.",
        "Mel: Was the pain in your abdomen, or was it a little higher?",
        "Lizzie: A little higher.",
        "Mel: Okay. Then it probably was digestive. You just had a sonogram, and everything looks fine. But it doesn't hurt to get another checkup if you want to. Okay? I'm on my way home, but I can arrange for another doctor to see you.",
        "Lizzie: That would be great, Mel. Would you come with me?",
        "Coop: Yeah, sure, of course I will.",
        "Mel: All right, well, I'll set it up. You guys meet me in the E.R., okay?",
        "Lizzie: All right. Thank you for looking after me. I'm so happy that you're the father of my baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Who the hell are you, letting that girl Ashlee tell you what to do? Anything to keep Lizzie from Tammy, I guess.",
        "Tammy: Hey, what are we doing tonight? Hey, where are you guys? Actually, more importantly, what are you doing right now?",
        "Jonathan: Sounds good to me.",
        "Tammy: I just saw my mom.",
        "Jonathan: Usually that has the opposite effect on you.",
        "Tammy: I'm just glad I have you, that's all. I just never want anything to come between us again.",
        "Jonathan: It won't. It won't. I'll make sure of it.",
        "Tammy: Hey, what's that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Thank you for being so great about all of this.",
        "Coop: Well, I am the baby's father, and I care just as much as you do.",
        "Lizzie: Would you hold me for a second? I'm just a little scared. I promise, I won't read anything into it.",
        "Coop: Yeah, come here. Look, don't worry, okay? Everything is going to be fine.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. I don't know how I'd get through this without you.",
        "Coop: Well, you're never gonna know because I'm always gonna be here, for you and for our baby.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. Our baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: I'm just so happy I ran into you.",
        "Cassie: Well, I got that. All right, could you possibly let me breathe now?",
        "Josh: Yes, I'm sorry. I apologize.",
        "Cassie: I'm guessing from that hug and that smile that the trip to Cross Creek with Reva was a big success?",
        "Josh: It was a fantastic success. I mean, Reva was so jazzed when she saw the place restored to its former glory, and she was even more excited when she found out we got it away from Olivia.",
        "Cassie: Really?",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: And what about the veterans project?",
        "Josh: She's totally onboard. She's helping me out with public relations, budgets, things like that.",
        "Cassie: That is great. Oh, my gosh, I'm so happy for you guys.",
        "Josh: Thank you.",
        "Cassie: Wow, so if Reva is going to be that involved, then you really don't need me working on the project anymore.",
        "Josh: Excuse me. I'm sorry, what are you talking about here? Of course I need you. In fact I wouldn't be doing anything if it weren't for you. And you have already given me a lot of great ideas.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, well, Reva will have a lot of great ideas. In fact, I'm sure she'll have better ones.",
        "Josh: You know what I was thinking actually? That you have experience in zoning regulations and variance applications, so you would be the logical person to find out what the regulations are in Oklahoma, and we're going to need a variance if we're going to do the back entrance into this complex.",
        "Cassie: Josh, no. You're not listening to me. I told you, this has been an amazing experience collaborating with you, but my work is done here. I'm out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Did I hear you right? Did you threaten to dump me as a patient?",
        "Colin: If you're here to discuss your treatment options rationally, then I have five minutes to spare. Otherwise you'll have to call my secretary to make an appointment.",
        "Reva: I told you, I'll make an appointment when I'm damn well ready to make an appointment.",
        "Colin: Mrs. Lewis, in that case, have a nice evening.",
        "Reva: Wait! Get back here!",
        "Colin: Is this better, more private for you? I could book us a room somewhere.",
        "Reva: You are incredible. You know that? You're terrible on the phone, you're worse in person. Hanging around hospitals just makes me sick.",
        "Colin: Most people would say the opposite.",
        "Reva: And you're so arrogant.",
        "Colin: I have a professional obligation to go over your treatment options with you, Mrs. Lewis. After that, if you prefer another oncologist, I'll recommend one to you-- very happily, believe me. Very happily, all right? All right, now first off...",
        "Reva: Stop steam-rolling me. Is this how you get your kicks? Harassing cancer victims? Cancer. I've got cancer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole Forester, \"Inside The Light.\"",
        "Cassie: I would love for Cassie to be happy. I would love to see Cassie happy for more than just a couple of moments in her day. But for a couple days in a row or maybe a couple of weeks. I'm psyched to be a part of a show that has lasted all these years and that everybody loves and I can't believe it. See Cassie on Wednesday, May 10, \"Inside The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Lizzie, if this is going to work, you have to stop doubting me.",
        "Lizzie: You think I'm doubting you?",
        "Coop: I'm just saying I'm not going to bail on you, okay? I'm here, I'm not going anywhere. Maybe this isn't exactly how we planned...",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, it definitely isn't.",
        "Coop: But you know what? It's going to be fine. It's going to be more than fine. Lizzie, it's going to be absolutely amazing. To see my own flesh and blood come into this world, to see him or her learn to walk and talk. You know, it's like I'm going to be the father. They're going to be dependent upon me. Whatever the child needs, I'm going to be there, Lizzie. Right now, if it's, let's say, a little girl, I'll be at all of her dance recitals, and I'll take her to the father/daughter picnics. And if it's a little boy, I'll teach him how to play catch and try and teach him how to ride a bike.",
        "Jonathan: When it's time for John-John's first tattoo, I'm going to make sure they only use sterile needles on him and I'm going to take him to get a custom motorcycle helmet so he doesn't crack his little head when I take him on his first road trip.",
        "Lizzie: Oh!",
        "Coop: Lizzie, are you having another pain?",
        "Lizzie: Ah, no, no, I'm fine. You know something? You're right. I'm never going to doubt you again, Coop, because now I know how really, really lucky our baby is that you're its father. You know what? I feel so much better. Let's get out of here.",
        "Coop: No. No, no, no. You're having the exam, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, but why are they taking so long? Look, it's a birthing class signup sheet.",
        "Nurse: I'm teaching this course. Are you and your husband expecting?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, he's not my husband.",
        "Nurse: Boyfriend?",
        "Lizzie: He's just the father of my baby. Okay, wait I didn't mean \"just\" like it's not important, what I meant was...",
        "Coop: What she meant was we'll be taking the class, both of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: You feel good.",
        "Tammy: Mmm, you, too. What is that stuff?",
        "Jonathan: It's just.. I don't know, somebody's tux or something. They left it here in the lost and found. You can make a contribution if you want.",
        "Tammy: Contribution?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, you could take off your shirt and put it in there. Or your pants. ( Laughs )",
        "Tammy: Did you notice we're not alone?",
        "Jonathan: Let's get alone real quick then.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I don't know what I'm going to do, Josh. The point is, it's called recharging your batteries and figuring stuff out.",
        "Josh: What are you talking about? You're not that deep.",
        "Cassie: I'm so that deep.",
        "Josh: I want you to work for me, okay? I need for you to work with me on this project.",
        "Cassie: You don't need me. You want me around because you want to keep an eye on me. You're afraid I'm going to go into a post-Jeffrey, post-Beacon funk.",
        "Josh: No, that's not true. I need you to work on this project because you're a very talented business woman and because I know you're already enthusiastic about this project. Think about it. Stop and think with me for a minute, okay? Here it is: Imagine the first day we break ground. Imagine the first time we admit patients to this facility. We would be fulfilling my father's dream of helping thousands of servicemen and women. Now, don't you want to look back on that one day and think to yourself, \"I was a part of making that happen\"?",
        "Cassie: Does anyone ever say \"no\" to you?",
        "Josh: Um, just my wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colin: You've admitted it, good.",
        "Reva: Is that the biggest step?",
        "Colin: No. So let's talk treatment. The mass that I removed with the lumpectomy looks to be localized.",
        "Reva: What do you mean \"looks to be\"?",
        "Colin: I took out some surrounding tissue and tested it, and it looks to be all clear, but you can never be sure. So the next step is radiation to eradicate any abnormal cells that might have moved beyond the area we removed. If they are still in your body... Mrs. Lewis, are you hearing me?",
        "Reva: Reva.",
        "Colin: I'll do some more tests on you before we start radiation to make sure nothing has changed in your condition.",
        "Reva: Changed?",
        "Colin: That's probably not the case.",
        "Reva: But if it is, could it be worse? Are you going to have to pump me full of chemo? Because that's worse than the cancer.",
        "Colin: That's ridiculous.",
        "Reva: No, you puke your guts out, you're in bed, you lose your hair, you can't take care of the people you love.",
        "Colin: That's not necessarily true.",
        "Reva: I've seen what it does to people and their families.",
        "Colin: Let's take things as they happen, Mrs. Lewis, okay? Just one step at a time.",
        "Reva: Easy for you to say. Okay, so, um, if I agree to the treatment, the radiation or whatever else, will I be cured? Promise me I'll beat it.",
        "Colin: I can't promise you that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Hey, where do you think you're going?",
        "Jonathan: I totally forgot that I have to do a family thing today.",
        "Tammy: What family thing?",
        "Jonathan: Just with Reva. I'll come back as soon as I can.",
        "Tammy: You better.",
        "Jonathan: You don't know how much I would rather just stay here with you than do what I have to do. But I'm doing it for us.",
        "Tammy: For us?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, Reva... you know, things have been like weird lately, so I figured we need a little mama bear/baby cub time.",
        "Tammy: I guess you're right. I'll miss you, but say hi to Reva for me. I'll see you later. Hey, Jonathan, I could go with you...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Boy, oh, boy, you have some bedside manner, doc. \"You know, lady, you're absolutely right, you could die.\" Not exactly the answer I wanted to hear.",
        "Colin: You want me to lie or happy it up? I could put it in a song for you.",
        "Reva: Do you get punched a lot?",
        "Colin: I'm just trying to be honest, Mrs. Lewis. Anything else would be a waste of your time and mine. If you're looking for a guarantee, a promise, I can't give you that. No doctor can. What I can give you is the best care possible. I'm an excellent physician, Mrs. Lewis.",
        "Reva: And so humble.",
        "Colin: But you have to let me do my job. And, as I said, there is no time to waste. Did you hear me?",
        "Reva: Yeah. And thanks for everything. I'll be in touch.",
        "Colin: You'll what?",
        "Reva: You've done your job as a doctor. You fulfilled your obligation. You gave me the facts. You suggested a course of treatment. And I'm opting to hold off.",
        "Colin: Opting? There is no opting in this situation, unless you consider living an optional condition.",
        "Reva: And that's what I'm doing, okay? I'm living. And if my days are numbered, I don't want to count them lying in a bed or with my head stuck in a toilet.",
        "Colin: Why are you doing this? It makes no sense. You're a bright woman-- though clearly not bright enough to have had yearly mammograms the way you should have. Why didn't you, Reva? What were you afraid of? Finding yourself facing exactly this? Well, welcome to reality. You're here now, exactly where you didn't want to be, and keeping your head stuck in the sand is not going to do you any good. It's only going to be making things worse.",
        "Reva: Just because you saw my breasts on an operating table doesn't mean you know all there is to know about me or my life. You don't know squat, pal. My husband is the most wonderful man and he is working on this brand-new project, this huge, important project, his father's legacy, his legacy. He needs me by his side right now. He needs me whole and healthy, not some shadow of myself wearing a wig and barfing every two seconds. All the times I've counted on him to be there for me, now finally for the first time ever he needs me. And Reva Shayne Lewis is not going to let him down. There is no way. I'm not going to let that man not fulfill his dreams, not for a little...",
        "Colin: Cancer?",
        "Reva: I was going to say a little scare.",
        "Colin: I'll make sure someone tells him that when you're gone.",
        "Reva: Go to hell. And one more thing. You're fired.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Okay, yes, this is going to be one big giant family circus, and we're going to drive each other crazy because we're going to be working together, but it's going to be great. Besides, it's not about me or some other guy or your sister trying to help you out because you're in need. This is about us helping each other, or helping other people, in fact, people we don't even know yet. If you want to do this, hey, I'm trying to figure what life is all about thing, you'll have time for that.",
        "Cassie: Are you making fun of me?",
        "Josh: No, not at all. But I promise you this, every morning at the office, we'll start the day this way: We'll all join in a circle, we'll hold hands, we'll breathe, we'll sing Kumbaya.",
        "Cassie: Good thing you're not making fun of me. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Josh: Okay, okay. What do your business instincts tell you about this call? Should I answer this call? Should I not answer it? I'll take that as a answer the call. Josh Lewis. Really? I'll be right there. I have to go. So the question is this: Are you going to help me with the zoning thing and work with people you love in a positive, nurturing environment on a project that will change people's lives, or are you going to sit around in your house all day in some kind of pretzel position doing a yoga thing and eating, I don't know, garbanzo beans or something like that? Thank you so much. Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I mean, I guess he or she will probably be okay. I mean, look at us. After my parents split, they had one bizarre marriage after another. You lost your mom and barely saw your dad. We turned out okay, right? Well, you did.",
        "Coop: Lizzie...",
        "Lizzie: No. A baby doesn't need its parents to be together. It just needs to know that it's loved. Coop?",
        "Coop: You know what? I've got to make a phone call. I'll be right back.",
        "Lizzie: Okay.",
        "Coop: ( Sighs ) Ava, hey, it's Coop. I know we had plans to hang out tonight, but I'm gonna have to bail on them. Something's come up. Look, I'm really sorry about this. I, um... you know what? We'll talk later. Bye.",
        "Lizzie: Date of conception. Oh, God. Why can't you be Coop's baby? Why do you have to be Jonathan's?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ashlee: Wow, I knew you would clean up good, Nate. I was beginning to think you were a no-show. Look, look what I got you.",
        "Jonathan: What's going on?",
        "Ashlee: Um, um... wait. Hold still, let me get it on. Look, we'll match.",
        "Jonathan: What is this?",
        "Ashlee: What do you think it is? It's my senior prom. And I'm here with the hottest guy in Springfield.",
        "Jonathan: Your prom? No. No way!",
        "Ashlee: No, Nate, please don't go. Hey Brianna, hey, Shawna, have you met my boyfriend?",
        "Jonathan: How old are you?",
        "Ashlee: I'm legal. I'm just a couple years younger than Lizzie.",
        "Jonathan: Okay, Lizzie. Let's talk about that. You promised me if I put on this monkey suit, you'd tell me the dirt you had on her.",
        "Ashlee: I will. You just have to dance with me first. Here, come on. Where everyone will see.",
        "Jonathan: No. No. I do not dance. No.",
        "Ashlee: Oh, hey, Madison, cool party, right? Just one dance, please.",
        "Jonathan: I'm sorry. Forget it. I can't. It's not worth it.",
        "Ashlee: She's a liar, Nate.",
        "Jonathan: I know.",
        "Ashlee: She lied about my uncle's clinic. She never saw a doctor there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I think it's really cool the way you're standing by Lizzie. I mean, I know you never expected to find yourself in this situation, especially with a girl you're not even involved with anymore.",
        "Coop: No, I am involved with Lizzie. I mean, we're connected for life now.",
        "Tammy: I know. And that must be overwhelming. But from a girl who grew up without a father and watched my mom struggle to raise me all by herself, I know how much this will mean to Lizzie and her baby, that you're going to be in their lives.",
        "Coop: It's just that everything has changed. I mean, everything. A few weeks back, I was all set, ready to go to Oxford. Everything was going really, really well with Ava and me, and now it's like... now it's like I'm this new guy. This guy with all these new problems. And...",
        "Tammy: So what are you thinking?",
        "Coop: Well, I'm thinking I can't be two people at once. I'm thinking that something has to give here. I have to face facts. I have to make a choice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Well, look at you. All the comfort and support I will need while my stitches heal. I think I can deal with a little discomfort. Besides, you don't work with my new dress.",
        "Josh: Hey.",
        "Reva: Hey.",
        "Josh: Is that my big surprise, a shopping bag?",
        "Reva: Actually it's what's in the bag that is the surprise. I went shopping.",
        "Josh: Ah, so much for work, I guess.",
        "Reva: Well, I figured working hours are over in Oklahoma, and you know what they say about all work and no play, so...",
        "Josh: Very, very nice. What's the occasion?",
        "Reva: There isn't one. We don't need an occasion. Not anymore.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Man: Very nice to meet you, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Likewise. You are so dead.",
        "Lizzie: There is somebody here at the prom here that really doesn't belong here.",
        "Tammy: Is there trouble? I'll be right there.",
        "Lizzie: Boy, I hope she drives fast."
