        "Jeffrey: Hi. Do you mind if I come in? Thanks.",
        "Michelle: I'm going to the hospital but, first, I think I might stop by the travel agency and see if I can exchange these.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, you've got travel plans, Michelle?",
        "Michelle: Yeah, you know, Bermuda, maybe Cabo. Danny and I are definitely going to take a vacation after all of this.",
        "Jeffrey: (Laughs) On the government's dime?",
        "Michelle: Yeah. I figure you'll owe us.",
        "Danny: Bye.",
        "Michelle: Bye.",
        "Jeffrey: Your wife doesn't do well with authority, does she?",
        "Danny: Yeah, well, neither do I. Authority tends to know all the angles, but doesn't fill anyone else in on them.",
        "Jeffrey: Sounds like you're talking about me, Danny. Is there a problem?",
        "Danny: Tony's back in the mob, working for Salerno. Tell me you didn't know.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, if I did, I'd be lying.",
        "Danny: That's my problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Will you marry me?",
        "Eden: Asked and answered, pal.",
        "Bill: Wow. Now, that is a gorgeous ring. The guy who gave it to you must have great taste.",
        "Eden: He does. Um, ready for a lifetime of commitment?",
        "Bill: Bring it on. As soon as we get this guest list sorted out and pick a date, pick a place and pick out my socks...",
        "Eden: I have a new idea for a guest list.",
        "Bill: What?",
        "Eden: Me and you and a witness and where, I'm thinking Vegas, and when, a flight as soon as we can get out of here.",
        "Bill: Come again?",
        "Eden: Let's just hop on a plane and then do the deed now. Let's get married tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Good morning, sweetheart. How are you feeling today?",
        "Phillip: Oh, couldn't be better.",
        "Olivia: Good.",
        "Phillip: Counting the days until I can come home to you and Emma and start my new life.",
        "Olivia: Won't that be something?",
        "Phillip: I'll take my place back at the head of Spaulding enterprises. You'll get to be a real stay-at- home mom to Emma, going to the park with the other moms, shopping for my ties.",
        "Olivia: Oh, it's like you know me better than I know myself. That's my idea of heaven. Listen, I just forgot something in the car, for you. Pictures of Emma. I think you'll like them. Let me go get them.",
        "Phillip: Oh, great.",
        "Olivia: What a nightmare.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Just have him page me at the hospital. Yeah. No, it isn't anything. Just have him call the office... no. Just have him call the office and make an appointment, that'll be the easiest thing to do. Okay, thank you. Bye. Hey.",
        "Olivia: Hi.",
        "Rick: What happened to you?",
        "Olivia: Nothing. Nothing. It's... it was my fault, all right? I provoked him.",
        "Rick: You're telling me Phillip did this to you?",
        "Olivia: He didn't mean to hurt me, Rick. I know that in my heart.",
        "Olivia: Look I've read everything I can on his condition, okay and I thought I was prepared. We were having a better morning, you know. I bought him some coffee. He told me he was feeling better. Just forget it all right.",
        "Rick: Tell me exactly what happened.",
        "Olivia: I was explaining to him how it feels to be living at the Spaulding mansion and how I think Lizzie was handling everything.",
        "Phillip: Yeah. I read the minutes of the last meeting, but nobody's got anything on the fluctuation of the stock price. Well, yeah. No. I want to know what's causing it. Set up a board meeting for two weeks. I'll be out by then.",
        "Olivia: All of a sudden he just grabbed my arm and he wouldn't let go. He was talking, he was paranoid, defensive, and incoherent.",
        "Rick: So how did you handle the situation?",
        "Olivia: I pretended like I heard a doctor walking down the hall. Then, as quickly as it started it was over and he was normal again, you know. It's like none of this ever happened.",
        "Rick: Did you confront him about this behavior?",
        "Olivia: I showed him my arm, my ripped clothes. He just looked at me like he had no idea what I was talking about. He just said hello to me just like I just walked into the room.",
        "Rick: I'm definitely going to talk to Phillip.",
        "Olivia: No, you can't do that. Don't please. Look. Just don't talk to him about the violence, okay. He would never believe that he was capable of hurting anybody.",
        "Rick: I'll be gentle with him.",
        "Olivia: Rick, I do want him to get better. It's just that my faith is a little shaky right now.",
        "Rick: Well, after what you've just described to me, I don't blame you for feeling that way. Soon as I know something I'll let you know.",
        "Olivia: Hi, it's me. Is there anymore Spaulding stock available? Wow, that would be a huge buy. No, I don't have that kind of cash. But I'll find it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Wow, you got here fast.",
        "Sandy: I move fast when someone offers to buy me lunch at towers.",
        "Lizzie: Well, I'm sorry I'm late.",
        "Sandy: No problem. You're a busy girl.",
        "Lizzie: No, I'm really not. If I was, I wouldn't have to fill my day with last minute lunch dates.",
        "Sandy: Ouch. That was harsh.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that.",
        "Sandy: Don't worry I can take it, as long as lunch is on you.",
        "Lizzie: You're kind of weird, Sandy.",
        "Sandy: Maybe that's why we get along, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, and I'm hard to get along with? Okay, I guess I (unintelligible) and you asked.",
        "Sandy: I like to think of you as a challenge. So, how come you're not busy? It's the end of the school year, graduation is coming up.",
        "Lizzie: Big deal. I'm acing every class except for one. Let's see I got my cap and gown measured. I don't think there's anything else left.",
        "Sandy: There's a lot left. Which is why I'm so glad you invited me for lunch today. Lizzie Spaulding, it's time to face the rest of your life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Look, you don't have to get mad at me.",
        "Eden: I am not mad.",
        "Bill: Well, your lip, it's doing that thing.",
        "Eden: It is not.",
        "Bill: And your tone. Come on.",
        "Eden: Oh, how am I supposed to say it, huh? I want to marry you and you don't want to marry me.",
        "Bill: I do want to marry you. I'm just not ready to do it in the next twelve hours that's all.",
        "Eden: We love each other. I want you and you want me.",
        "Bill: Yes, that's true. I mean... honey, what's the hurry? Are you afraid I'm going to dump you or something? Come on.",
        "Eden: You know, you could have your pick of any woman in the world, and I am just so lucky.",
        "Bill: Okay, you're crazy. First of all, you could get any guy you wanted.",
        "Eden: Yeah, only the guys that are interested in me, I'm just not interested in, okay.",
        "Bill: Wait a minute. I'm interested in you. What are you trying to say here? Come over here. I don't know where this is coming from all right, but I want you to know one thing. I am going to marry you.",
        "Eden: What if something happens, bill? I love you so much. The thought of living my life without you is like death to me.",
        "Bill: Listen. I mean...",
        "Eden: Really.",
        "Bill: ...What about the ceremony? You know, and all the great stuff. I mean you were so excited about the dresses and the flowers and gifts. I mean...",
        "Eden: It's just getting all complicated. I just want to be your wife.",
        "Bill: I don't know. We've been dreaming about this big wedding and stuff. It's tough to just get out of my head right now.",
        "Eden: I know...",
        "Bill: And I really want my uncle josh and my dad standing up for me.",
        "Eden: I know.",
        "Bill: Listen. Okay, we are about to pledge our life and our love to one another in front of everyone who cares about us. All right. This is huge. This is going to be an amazing start to a new life, all right.",
        "Eden: Can't we just skip the rest and get to the new life part? I literally can't wait, Bill.",
        "Bill: I'm getting that.",
        "Eden: I already bought the tickets for Vegas.",
        "Bill: What?",
        "Eden: Just in case you said yes. Can you just go to the travel agent and pick them up? We don't have to use them. We can just... just in case, okay? Honey, you love me, right?",
        "Bill: More than anyone in this world.",
        "Eden: All I want is you. You're all I need. Please, make me your wife. Please.",
        "Bill: I'll get the tickets.",
        "Eden: Thank you. Thank you, honey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: You know the truth about Tony was going to come out one way or another. You just don't like surprises that's all.",
        "Danny: You're damn right. I don't like surprises.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, Tony is in the mob, Danny! I don't believe for a second that you were that surprised when you found out.",
        "Danny: That's not...",
        "Jeffrey: No, that's what I thought. So you're angry at him and at yourself and not me.",
        "Danny: The point is you nearly compromised this entire operation. When Tony and I saw each right outside the meeting with Salerno, we nearly ripped each other heads off.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you've got to learn to control your temper, Danny. What's the matter with you, throwing punches? What's wrong with you?",
        "Danny: If you want a better chance of success, you need to tell me everything. Not just what you think I need to know.",
        "Danny: Let's get one thing clear.",
        "Jeffrey: I think I'm going to play this close to the vest, if you don't mind. I think that's what you would do isn't it?",
        "Danny: Let's get one thing clear. The deal was I cooperate, help you bring down the mob, and Cassie and Tony don't get touched.",
        "Jeffrey: That's still the deal on the table, Danny.",
        "Danny: They both get immunity?",
        "Jeffrey: I've got no reason to throw Cassie Winslow into jail, okay? She trusted you. She still doesn't know that you duped her. I'm willing to keep things the way they are.",
        "Danny: And Tony?",
        "Jeffrey: Tony has been a messed up kid his whole life, okay? Now don't tell me that you thought he went out of town and came back a new man?",
        "Danny: Is Tony still a part of our deal?",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, he is, Danny. You obviously care a lot about him. That gives me some leverage on you to keep you in line. What I want, Danny...",
        "Danny: Yeah, I know what you want: The big fish.",
        "Jeffrey: That's right. The big fish.",
        "Danny: How long have you've known Tony was back in?",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, it doesn't matter how long, Danny. Okay, he's in the mob. If you do your job, there's not going to be a mob for him to be involved with. Can we get down to business please? Thank you. Now, Salerno, did he and the other mob bosses just welcome you back with open arms or what? What happened?",
        "Danny: I'm still breathing.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, for now.",
        "Danny: Yeah, I'm in. I'm at the bottom, but I'm in.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, what did you learn?",
        "Danny: Salerno was planning to make a move into Springfield.",
        "Jeffrey: Really?",
        "Danny: Mm-hmm. Yeah. He's going to want to assert himself right away. Make a bold statement. Let everyone know that's there's a new boss in town.",
        "Jeffrey: And what kind of a statement would that be, Danny?",
        "Danny: He thinks that killing the district attorney might make a big enough splash.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Hey. I heard you got Tammy out of the room.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, nothing like the love of a good boyfriend to make things rosy again.",
        "Olivia: Joey got her to come out?",
        "Cassie: Yes. But she's still playing hardball. She's one emotional bat and she's not afraid to use it.",
        "Olivia: She'll come around. She's your little girl.",
        "Cassie: No, what you have is a little girl. What I have resembles a woman and I am just not prepared for that I guess.",
        "Olivia: You're being too hard on yourself. It was a moment, okay. You're wonderful with Tammy.",
        "Cassie: I'm not. Don't come here for any more advice. I just walked away from a barricaded stand off. You're on your own.",
        "Olivia: No. No, no, no.",
        "Cassie: Yes.",
        "Olivia: You can't abandon me like that. I'm going to need you when Emma's Tammy's age.",
        "Cassie: Send her away when she's Tammy's age. Send her away and don't let her come back till after she's graduated college and she can live on her own.",
        "Olivia: You don't mean that. (Laughs)",
        "Cassie: Well, I think it... sometimes. I do. I never thought I would. Tammy and I always had such a great relationship. We were never going to be like all those other people, you know, have all those problems, all those horror stories, you hear, but... never mind. How are you? How's Emma? How's Phillip?",
        "Olivia: Fine. Fine. Fine. And I actually have an idea that I think might cheer you up.",
        "Cassie: You have a way of brainwashing Tammy to be my little princess again?",
        "Olivia: No, but I can give you something else that you love: The beacon.",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Olivia: I want to sell my half of the hotel.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: So, how are we doing today?",
        "Phillip: How are we doing?",
        "Rick: Yeah.",
        "Phillip: I don't know about you, but I'm doing great. I'm on top of the world, pal.",
        "Rick: Good. That's great. So talk to me. Tell me what's going on.",
        "Phillip: Everything is good. Energy is good. Head is clear. I don't know if you can tell, but I am-- hey, talking to you.",
        "Rick: I'm listening.",
        "Phillip: I am feeling very close to my old self.",
        "Rick: Good. So, how is life with Olivia?",
        "Phillip: My loving wife?",
        "Rick: Ah-huh.",
        "Phillip: I guess as well as can be expected. This has all been very hard on her.",
        "Rick: Right. So did things go okay with you guys this morning?",
        "Phillip: She was just here.",
        "Rick: Right.",
        "Phillip: Did you see her?",
        "Rick: Okay, so you do remember seeing her, right?",
        "Phillip: Is that a trick therapy question?",
        "Rick: I guess I was never good at those, was I?",
        "Phillip: No.",
        "Rick: No. I ran into Olivia in the hallway.",
        "Phillip: I think she's a little surprised at how quickly my condition is improving.",
        "Rick: Yeah, that's definitely true, but then again she doesn't know about the ECT treatments, right?",
        "Phillip: Right. She doesn't need to know about it. I'm getting better. That's all that matters. Buddy, I know that you're anxious to get out of this place.",
        "Phillip: Yeah. I can't wait to get my life back. You're going to help me with that. You tell me, honestly. What do you see?",
        "Rick: Well, I see great improvements, you know. I mean and I was actually thinking it seemed that you're well on your way to recovery actually.",
        "Phillip: Seem? Okay. What's going on?",
        "Rick: Well, I did talk to your wife.",
        "Phillip: Ah-huh. Yeah. What did she have to say?",
        "Rick: Well, she... she, you know, she had some concerns.",
        "Phillip: About?",
        "Rick: Let me reevaluate your chart, go over everything and just to see where we are at.",
        "Phillip: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: So Vinnie wants to press the button on me, huh?",
        "Danny: Actually, his exact words were, he wanted to whack you. But I talked him out of it.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, good thing for me that I had a friend in the room.",
        "Danny: Don't be so sure. If you go down, I go down. Besides, I think Vinnie was just talking. I think he'd much rather see you suffer-- really suffer.",
        "Jeffrey: Should I be scared?",
        "Danny: Hey, you could play tough guy all you want, O'Neill, but watch your back.",
        "Jeffrey: That's what you're supposed to be doing, remember? So Vinnie's got me in his sights. That's a good thing. At least he's close enough to be in mine. So tell me, Danny...",
        "Danny: Hmm?",
        "Jeffrey: What was it like being back with the old cronies? Did you miss them?",
        "Danny: O'Neill, the only reason I'm dealing with those guys or you for that matter is to protect the people I care about.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, good. Then you could start by telling everything that Vinnie said in that room.",
        "Danny: Well, the whole meeting was obviously a test-- not the last test I'm going to get. (Knock at the door)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eden: Bill? Is it locked? (Screams)",
        "Salerno: How are you doing, Eden? Packing? You're not leaving me, are you? I just got here. Have a seat.",
        "Bill: Well, someone's making a \"B\" line for the travel agency. Going somewhere?",
        "Michelle: No. Are you?",
        "Bill: Maybe. So then what are you doing? Just here checking out the weekly specials or what?",
        "Michelle: Is that what you're doing?",
        "Bill: Answering a question with a question. Wow, someone doesn't want to talk.",
        "Michelle: You know, Bill, after what you said about Danny rigging the election the other day, I really don't think we have anything to talk about.",
        "Bill: Okay, Michelle, can we just forget about that stuff for now. I really need a friend to talk to. if you can just pretend that you're my friend for now, that will really help.",
        "Michelle: Hey, I guess I can try.",
        "Bill: Eden wants to elope.",
        "Michelle: Why?",
        "Bill: I don't know. She's like stressed out about the wedding. She's just wants to be married.",
        "Michelle: Bill, is she really the one?",
        "Bill: Yeah, she is.",
        "Michelle: All right. Well, then does it really matter where you get married?",
        "Bill: I guess not. I don't know. I think she's going to miss having a real wedding. I mean honestly at this point, I mean I want a real wedding, you know. I don't know why she changed her mind so quickly.",
        "Michelle: Well, sounds like she got spooked.",
        "Bill: I don't know. Maybe. Who knows? It's like one minute she's so excited looking at dresses and the next she's a wreck. She wants to fly out to Vegas.",
        "Michelle: Well, you know getting married is a big deal whether it's in Springfield or in Vegas. I mean you need to figure out why she got freaked out so suddenly though. Does she have some sort of a secret or...",
        "Bill: No, there's no secret, Michelle.",
        "Michelle: Well, how do you know?",
        "Bill: Because... because I know her. That's why.",
        "Michelle: You wanted to talk. So, this is what I have to say.",
        "Bill: Well, great. Well, at least we're talking about something you hold near and dear. Keeping secrets in a marriage, huh.",
        "Michelle: Okay, now we're done talking. Now we're going to fight.",
        "Bill: Mm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You want to sell your half of the beacon to me?",
        "Olivia: Yeah. I mean, think of how exciting, it'll be. You'll finally be able to re- carpet the fifth floor with that really ugly blue flowered print you like so much. Come on.",
        "Cassie: Well, as exciting as the way that sounds, why the heck are you doing this?",
        "Olivia: Cassie, why not? You've been running this place by yourself practically for the past few months. It just seems like a good time to get out.",
        "Cassie: Is this because of what happened with Emma?",
        "Olivia: No.",
        "Cassie: Then why?",
        "Olivia: The truth?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, that would be nice.",
        "Olivia: The truth is my life is different now. I wish it was completely in my control, listen, I have Phillip to consider and I have a baby. And I am forging a new path at Spaulding, and right now running this hotel would sort of tip the scales a bit.",
        "Cassie: So you're overloaded?",
        "Olivia: Basically, yeah. Up until now, Emma was my first concern, you know. My biggest fear for her was her safety and she's safe now. She's fine. And I just feel like I need to focus all my energies and time into raising her in that family. And I do have Phillip to worry about.",
        "Cassie: Will he be coming home?",
        "Olivia: I don't know. I just know I have to be ready. The truth is I don't know what kind of man is coming home. And right now this hotel just isn't as important to me as it used to be. I want out.",
        "Cassie: Wow. Wow, that's... it's major. I don't know what... I don't even know how to respond to this.",
        "Olivia: I'll make you a fair deal. I promise you. Fire sale fair.",
        "Cassie: Are you sure this isn't because of me?",
        "Olivia: No, Cassie. It's not personal. I promise. At least not between you and me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: Okay, do we have a prognosis? Educated guess? Forecast?",
        "Rick: Fair with a chance of rain.",
        "Phillip: Oh, good. Well, that's my normal forecast.",
        "Rick: Yeah. Listen, buddy, don't you think you're gong to jump on the rat race again being an unchanged man, because you're not.",
        "Phillip: I just want to get back in the race.",
        "Rick: I know. Just give me time to go over all this information. We'll just see where we are, okay.",

        "Michelle: Bill, I am a part of that stuff. That's what marriage is all about. You stay. You do whatever you can to stay.",
        "Bill: No matter what?",
        "Michelle: Look, I've got nothing to escape from. I'm exactly where I need to be. But you, you're thinking about the good old days and being free. You should think really hard before you start eloping with Eden.",
        "Bill: Hey, hey, hey, I am cool with Eden. I don't want you under the impression that I'm getting cold feet with her--",
        "Michelle: You know what? It doesn't even matter. It doesn't matter what I think, does it? Because all the really matters is what you think deep down in your heart. I mean are you really being honest about how you feel?",

        "Danny: Tony, I'm not muscling on anyone. Especially not you. All right? But I get what you're saying. We're not a team anymore.",
        "Tony: No, we're not. Just make sure, Danny, that your plans don't interfere with Salerno's operation. I don't want to get a call about you.",
