        "Mallet: Not always.",
        "Harley: No, you have. You've always made me feel safe. I missed you.",
        "Mallet: I missed you, too.",

        "Edmund: I'm the one who should be meeting with alonzo cassie. I've been speaking with him on the phone, I'm his ambassador, he's my brother. Makes sense that I continue the dialog personally.",
        "Jeffrey: No offense, mr. Ambassador, but I think that cassie should be allowed to plead her own case being that will is her son.",
        "Edmund: Well, thank your opinion, mr. O'neill. But you don't quite understand the situation.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, what's to understand, mr. Ambassador. It's a mother's love for her son. Certainly the good prince could understand that.",
        "Edmund: I'm afraid it's not that simple.",
        "Cassie: Well, it should be that simple, edmund. Alonzo knows how much I love will.",
        "Edmund: But it's not question of how much you love your son, cassie.",
        "Cassie: No, it's a question of politics.",
        "Edmund: Exactly.",
        "Cassie: Well, you know what? Alonzo used to be my friend. And I think he'll listen to me.",
        "Edmund: I don't mean to discourage you, cassie. It's just that a lot has changed since we last saw alonzo.",
        "Cassie: He's that different?",
        "Edmund: Well not just he, we. Our situation. Our living arrangements. Dinah.",
        "Cassie: He knows about that.",
        "Edmund: Well, I'm sure his advisors have been keeping abreast of the situation.",
        "Cassie: Well, then there's even more of a reason for me to go down there and talk to him myself.",
        "Jeffrey: All right, kids. Clocks ticking. Got to go.",
        "Cassie: Jeffrey's right.",
        "Edmund: I just wish you'd let me handle this.",
        "Cassie: Well, I thank you for wanting to help me, edmund. But this is something I really need to do.",

        "Lizzie: Why does my family do half the crazy things they do?",
        "Cooper: ( Laughs ) you're actually admitting that your family...",
        "Lizzie: You quote me, I'm going to deny it.",
        "Copper: Okay. All right. Wait. Here's the lights.",
        "Lizzie: Oh.",
        "Cooper: All right. That's better. So... now you're sure that this is the right place?",
        "Lizzie: Yes, I'm sure.",
        "Cooper: All right. So where is he?",
        "Lizzie: Well, this is big building. There's lots of rooms.",

        "Buzz: They're not going to let you in.",
        "Gus: Yeah. That's where you come in.",
        "Buzz: It's going to take a lot more than my help to get you in that prison.",
        "Gus: Do you believe in divine intervention?",
        "Mallet: Harley, come on. Come on. Harley, wake up. Wake up. Wake up.",

        "Mallet: Yeah, you're right. You're always right, harley.",
        "Harley: Even though I'm always right, I'd give anything not to be right this time. But we don't want to give the natives any other reason to be unhappy. Right?",

        "Harley: I'm going back to my cell...",

        "Lizzie: I'll let him out when I'm good and ready.",
        "Coop: Let me see if i understand this, here. Your claustrophobic grandfather is locked behind this door right here and you want to leave him in there?",
        "Lizzie: No.",
        "Coop: No, but what, lizzie? I mean, look, I don't even like the guy, and I'm not even that cruel.",

        "Coop: You're scared.",

        "Coop: Wow.",
        "Lizzie: What just makes me so mad is that it's like my granddad doesn't even care who killed my dad, just... he just wants someone to pay.",
        "Coop: Yeah. That someone seems to be my sister.",
        "Lizzie: Today, yeah. He's going to be so mad when we let him out of there.",
        "Coop: Yeah, he is. But we have got to let him out of there. I mean, doesn't he have a heart condition?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. Here.",
        "Alan: You.",
        "Lizzie: No, wait. Don't touch him! I'll lock you back in there!",

        "Mallet: Harley? You've got to ke up.",
        "Harley: Well, your little walk down memory lane put me to sleep. It must not have been too exciting a story.",
        "Mallet: No, I guess not.",
        "Harley: Mallet, look. That was different, okay? We were different.",
        "Mallet: Not so different. Don't you ever think about it at all?",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Mallet: Us. What it used to be.",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Mallet: Yeah. Me, either.",
        "Harley: I want to go back to my cell.",
        "Mallet: Okay. Okay, go back to your cell. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Ssh. I got you.",
        "Harley: Why do I get the feeling that you are enjoying this?",
        "Mallet: What kind of a feeling is it?",
        "Harley: Don'T... don't do that, okay?",
        "Mallet: Uh, do what?",
        "Harley: The banter thing.",
        "Mallet: Ah, you mean flirting for trying to keep you from lapsing into a coma?",
        "Harley: That's just obnoxious. But you always were obnoxious.",
        "Mallet: ( Laughs ) okay. Uh, like when?",
        "Harley: Like when we were at the academy and you were my teacher.",
        "Mallet: Yh?",
        "Harley: Yeah. And you would always put me on the spot and you'd try to embarrass me. You were way too tough on me.",
        "Mallet: I was. I was?",
        "Harley: Yes. You were a jerk to me then, just like you're a jerk to me now.",
        "Mallet: Well, I wasn't about to give you special treatment.",
        "Harley: Well, what was that? I mean... was that just some kind of thrill for you, punishing me like that in front of everybody?",
        "Mallet: No, I didn't do it to punish you. I did it because I loved you.",
        "Lena: Hey, wait, wait, wait a minute. It is you.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, did I hear you just say that you would lock me back up in there?",
        "Coop: She was upset, okay?",
        "Alan: Not a word out of you, mr. Bradshaw. This is a family matter.",
        "Lizzie: You were out of there for two seconds and you were going to hurt someone. What is wrong with you?",
        "Alan: Nothing is wrong with me now; I am out of there. But you tell me why, when I was hollering for you, you would not open the door.",
        "Lizzie: I'm sorry.",
        "Alan: I know why. Because he put you up to it, that's why.",
        "Lizzie: No! It was me, okay? I did it because I was scared to death. I was scared of you. I mean, you locked gus in that basement...",
        "Alan: I told you, I'm not the one who locked gus in there, elizabeth.",
        "Lizzie: ( Exasperated sigh ) this is ridiculous. No wonder everybody hates us; we hate each other.",
        "Alan: Nonsense. I know why you're doing this. You're doing this all because of him, isn't that right? Admit it.",
        "Lizzie: You know what? You're right. And it's about time. You know what? Somebody had to showur family what they were doing, and I'm glad coop opened up my eyes.",
        "Alan: You don't mean that, elizabeth.",
        "Lizzie: I do mean that. I don't want to end up like dad. Or like you.",
        "Harley: Do you have any coffee?",
        "Mallet: It makes you uncomfortable.",
        "Harley: Prison coffee? Well, you know, it's not always pleasant, but...",
        "Mallet: No, I mean when i talk about our past.",
        "Harley: Uncomfortable, no. Angry maybe.",
        "Mallet: Is that all?",
        "Harley: Most of the time.",
        "Mallet: Well, what about the rest.",
        "Harley: Why are you doing this?",
        "Mallet: Because I don't like lying.",
        "Harley: Well, that is pretty funny coming from you, now.",
        "Mallet: See, that's what I'm talking about. You say over and over again that the past means nothing to you, that you've moved on, and then every time I bring our past up, you look like you're going to rip my eyes out. That's not moving on.",
        "Harley: Then what is it?",
        "Mallet: That's raw. That's still hurting.",
        "Harley: You sure about that?",
        "Mallet: Hell, yeah. Yeah, I'm pretty sure.",
        "Harley: Well, you said... you said that you were hard on me when I was in the academy because you loved me. Why are you being so tough on me now?",
        "Lena: Wait. You were the guard that told me my daughter was visiting today. I just... is she here yet?",
        "Gus: Well, actually I just got that call. I was on my way to get you.",

        "Guard: But visiting hour time ended an hour ago.",
        "Gus: Yeah, I know, I know, i know. But it'S... what can I say? Special orders.",
        "Guard: Do I know you?",
        "Gus: Well, no. Augustino. I juts got transferred two days ago from jackson.",
        "Lena: Could we go? I'm a little anxious.",
        "Gus: Yes, absolutely. You know what? I'll take it from here. Thanks.",
        "Lena: Thanks. Quite an outfit.",

        "Gus: Who are you?",
        "Lena: Oh, harley and I are roomies. I've seen your picture. You don't smell so good. You know you're actually cuter in person.",
        "Gus: Wait, wait, wait. She's got a picture of me?",

        "Dinah: Listen, you know how suspicio jeffrey is, especially of you.",
        "Edmund: Don't play games with me.",

        "Jeffrey: It'S... it's nothing but I think I might have to go get some help.",
        "Cassie: Well, you can't go by yourself, jeffrey.",
        "Dinah: Well, I'll go with him.",
        "Cassie: No, you're not going to go with him. You're pregnant. You need to stay here, keep your feet up. You need to rest, okay? I will go with him.",
