        "Harley: There. Something tells me this is a big mistake. Alexandra's not just going to leave drugs lying around the study.",
        "Gus: Not so fast, Coop.",
        "Harley: You found the drugs?",
        "Gus: Look at this.",
        "Harley: This is the bracelet that your mother was wearing in the picture.",
        "Gus: I can't believe that she's had this bracelet the entire time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: No one was more surprised than I, when Richard made his decision to leave San Cristobel and make life here in Springfield. As always, he had everyone else's best interests at heart. That is how he lived his life. And as much as he missed the home he loved, he never regretted that decision for one minute. That was due in part to the fine welcome he received here in his new home. So on behalf of my brother, I thank you for your kindness and generosity both then and now. Good night. (Cheers and applause)",
        "Bell captain: Good evening, sir. The Richard Winslow event has started a long time ago. All of the guests are out on the garden, and I think that was the last speech.",
        "Cassie: That was a wonderful speech. It was amazing.",
        "Edmund: Thank you. Thank you, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: I mean, you really affected those people. Did you see the looks on all of their faces? Yes. Thank you.",
        "Edmund: I hope so.",
        "Cassie: This memorial for Richard is going to be such a huge success. Thank you, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: No, Cassie. Cassie, thank you. You've inspired me.",
        "Cassie: Me?",
        "Edmund: Yes. I saw Richard through your eyes.",
        "Cassie: I wish you could see yourself through my eyes right now. You're a different man tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: It was in Roy's safe, she beat me to.",
        "Gus: And this is what he was holding over our head the entire time. So my mother is the servant, Alan has his fun, and then his sister comes and cleans up the whole mess for him. Nice.",
        "Harley: Listen to me. Alex did a hell of a job keeping the truth from you, but you... you can't take that personally.",
        "Gus: I can't take it personally? Are you serious?",
        "Harley: No. No, you can't. Listen, there is so much bad blood between Alan and Alexandra. Their... their dynamic is just twisted.",
        "Gus: This whole family is twisted. She's done so many rotten things, but the worst thing of all is keeping the truth from me. I'm sorry, but I'm going to nail her for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: I shouldn't have done that.",
        "Tammy: Mom, are you ready?",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Tammy: To form our receiving line.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I'm ready.",
        "Tammy: Are you okay?",
        "Cassie: I'm fine.",
        "Edmund: Shall we?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lloyd: Can I get you something, Ms. Spaulding?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, as a matter of fact, you can. They're only serving champagne here. I would like a vodka martini, very dry, very cold, with two olives.",
        "Lloyd: Of course. I'll be right back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: You know we don't have to stay. We could just go back to the loft if you want.",
        "Olivia: No, it's still early.",
        "Phillip: That doesn't matter. I know that this is difficult for you.",
        "Olivia: It's hard, but I want to be here for Richard.",
        "Phillip: Okay.",
        "Olivia: Okay. Whoa!",
        "Phillip: What?",
        "Olivia: You have to feel this.",
        "Phillip: Whoa. She packs quite a wallop.",
        "Olivia: Or he. You know, I've been feeling this little fluttering for a while, but these are so...",
        "Phillip: Makes it real.",
        "Olivia: It's our baby, Phillip.",

        "Cassie: And bringing masks. You guys look wonderful.",
        "Rick: Thank you.",
        "Tammy: Glad you came.",
        "Edmund: Richard meant so much to our family. I mean, without him, you know...",
        "Cassie: I know.",
        "Rick: Save me a dance later, okay?",
        "Tammy: Yes.",
        "Ed: Looking tired.",
        "Rick: Oh, I just had a long day, Dad. I'm fine. I just... I actually got to call my service. Why don't you, you know, hook up with Mel, and I'll talk to you in a few minutes.",
        "Ed: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Hi.",
        "Reva: You were great. You look so good.",

        "Marah: I second that.",
        "Cassie: Thank you.",
        "Reva: Are you happy?",

        "Josh: Glad to be here.",
        "Edmund: Thanks for coming.",
        "Josh: Nice speech.",
        "Edmund: Well, Richard's words mostly, but I think he'd be happy.",
        "Josh: It's a start.",
        "Edmund: Ah.",
        "Phillip: Good show.",
        "Edmund: Another one of my fans.",
        "Phillip: No, I mean it. It was a good speech.",
        "Edmund: Thank you.",
        "Phillip: Had me going there for a minute. And then I had a thought.",
        "Edmund: You did?",
        "Phillip: Yeah.",
        "Edmund: Hmm.",
        "Phillip: Yes, my aunt has been acting so strangely since she came back to town, and she's been spending so much time with you. Go figure.",
        "Edmund: What are you saying, Phillip?",
        "Phillip: Just that people don't generally change.",
        "Edmund: Well, I hate to burst your big Spaulding bubble, but I don't even think you can bring me down tonight, because not everyone has that opinion.",

        "Tony: ...Graham cracker crust.",
        "Marah: Mmm, yes.",
        "Tony: What do you say we go outside and we have a drink under the stars?",
        "Marah: I think that sounds like fun.",
        "Tony: Let's go.",
        "Josh: I think that that sounds like fun, too. I think I'll join you, okay?",
        "Tony: (Sighs)",
        "Josh: I'll see you.",
        "Reva: Okay.",
        "Shayne: So what's the story? What are you and Dad fighting about?",
        "Reva: We're not fighting.",
        "Shayne: What, you didn't think we were going to notice? You guys have been giving each other the cold shoulder all night long.",
        "Reva: Shayne, we're having a disagreement about something, but it's no big deal, really. Nothing at all.",
        "Shayne: Nothing at all. Okay, well, you know what? This better not be about me and my baseball, because it's not worth making everybody miserable, okay?",
        "Alan: Reva, you've never looked lovelier.",
        "Reva: Alan?",
        "Alan: Don't turn around. Look straight ahead.",
        "Reva: You old buzzard. You know half the town's looking for you.",
        "Alan: Well, they can keep on looking.",
        "Reva: What are you doing here?",
        "Alan: Well, let's just say I'm on a mission. But don't you worry. The only ones that'll be affected are my nearest and dearest.",

        "Harley: Hello?",
        "Alexandra: Harley, thank goodness I've reached you. Is everything all right there?",
        "Harley: Yes, so far.",
        "Alexandra: Well, no sign of Alan? Nothing out of the ordinary, huh?",
        "Harley: Well, I'm upstairs now. It's been pretty quiet actually.",
        "Alexandra: Well, good, good.",
        "Harley: So you're coming home?",
        "Alexandra: In a little while. I'll... I'll ring you before I leave.",
        "Gus: Look what I found. Look, what I...",
        "Alexandra: Harley, who is that? Is someone there with you?",
        "Harley: Nobody's here.",
        "Alexandra: I distinctly heard...",
        "Harley: It was the TV, okay? I just flipped on the TV. I'll turn it off, and I'll check the house again before I leave.",
        "Alexandra: Well, maybe you want to turn on the stereo. The button's right next to the TV.",
        "Harley: She heard you.",
        "Gus: Well, I didn't know you were on the phone. I'm sorry. Did she buy the story?",
        "Harley: I doubt it. What is this?",
        "Gus: Look what I found. Look what I found. Now, do you remember when he said that Beth was coming on to him? Remember when Alan said that? This is what I found at the bottom of Alex's closet.",
        "Harley: Oh, come on, you don't suppose...",
        "Gus: Oh, I think so; I think so. And I found enough tranquilizers... Enough tranquilizers to take down an entire country, okay? Now, if any of this is the same stuff that we found in Alan's system...",
        "Harley: Okay, we got to get... We got to get out of here.",
        "Gus: I'm not finished yet.",

        "Alan: Keep watching, because the fun is about to begin.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Lloyd, I just spoke to Harley, and she's at the house. It didn't... It didn't sound quite right. There might be some trouble that she couldn't say anything about. But I distinctly heard a man's voice.",
        "Lloyd: Your brother?",
        "Alexandra: I don't know. But I want you to go to the house, and I want you to check it out anyway, all right? Go, please.",
        "Lloyd: I shouldn't leave you alone.",

        "Phillip: ...Easy.",
        "Ross: Phillip, my secretary said that you called.",
        "Blake: Oh, yeah. Any word from Alan?",
        "Phillip: No. But I'm adopting a no-news-is-good-news philosophy on that subject.",
        "Blake: You're tougher than I am. I don't think I could handle the no news.",
        "Olivia: I mean, wherever Alan is, he's a resourceful person. I'm sure he's going to be fine.",
        "Phillip: Yeah, actually, Ross, I am... I called to ask you something else. Would... would you consider heading up the legal department at Spaulding again?",
        "Ross: Why? Did Gordon Maynard quit?",
        "Phillip: No, I fired him. He's one of Alan's cronies.",
        "Blake: You're really taking over the company, aren't you? That must make you happy.",
        "Olivia: I'm happy for Phillip, yeah.",
        "Blake: Of course you are.",
        "Bell captain: Excuse me, Ms. Spencer. I hate to interrupt, but there's a problem with one of the cases of champagne.",
        "Olivia: Sure. Excuse me, please.",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm. Okay, look, I know, you've been out of the corporate shark tank for a long time.",
        "Ross: And there's an awfully good reason for that, as I recall, Phillip. I am very content with my law practice, and I'm still teaching at the university.",
        "Phillip: I understand that, and all I want you to do is tell me that you'll think about it. It would be different. I'm going to make a lot of changes once I officially take over.",

        "Cassie: Call me Cassie, please, and thank you so much for coming.",

        "Olivia: Okay, if you can just take care of that, I'd appreciate it. Thank you. Hi.",
        "Rick: Hey.",
        "Olivia: I asked you if this were your own private party, but you look like your dog just died or something.",
        "Rick: Really?",
        "Olivia: Yeah.",
        "Rick: Why don't you sit down?",
        "Olivia: Thanks.",
        "Rick: Do I really look that bad?",
        "Olivia: No. No, you just look a little tired.",
        "Rick: That seems to be a recurring theme tonight. My dad told me the same thing.",
        "Olivia: But you're not tired. You know, I... I thought about not showing up tonight, just skipping the whole thing.",
        "Rick: Really? Why?",
        "Olivia: Probably the same reason you're sitting by yourself. Richard.",
        "Rick: Richard. Makes you think.",
        "Olivia: And feel-- something I've tried real hard to avoid most of my life, but I couldn't tonight, you know. There was a time when he meant the world to me, and I just knew that if I wasn't here, it'd be like letting him down, you know, somehow-- and myself.",
        "Rick: I really wanted to be here tonight, and I just...",
        "Olivia: Didn't think you would think about it so much. I know.",
        "Rick: (Sighs) I really should be out there.",
        "Olivia: Wait, wait, wait. That wasn't what I was getting at.",
        "Rick: No. You should just suck it up and go. I mean, Richard probably did things all the time that he didn't want to do. He was the prince, this perfect guy.",
        "Olivia: I'm going to let you in on a little secret, but Richard was actually very human. I mean, he wasn't big on events like this. Trust me. So you're taking a moment for yourself. So what, right?",
        "Rick: (Sighs)",
        "Olivia: Right. Look, there was a state dinner once. It was this big, fancy formal affair, and Richard was gone. He just disappeared. I couldn't find him anywhere. And I looked all over, and finally I found him out on one of the terraces, and there he was sitting on the ledge with his bare feet dangling over the side. He was just sitting there listening to the ocean.",
        "Rick: Really?",
        "Olivia: Yeah.",
        "Rick: I really didn't know him that well.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, not many people did. You may not be a prince, Rick Bauer, but you certainly have the values of one, and Richard would be so proud that you have his heart.",
        "Rick: Thanks. Thanks.",
        "Olivia: Sure. See you.",
        "Rick: Bye.",
        "Ed: Hey.",
        "Olivia: Hey.",
        "Ed: Mel's worried about you.",
        "Rick: Where is she?",
        "Ed: She's out there. She's cornered by a couple of hospital board members. You got to go rescue her.",
        "Rick: All right, all right.",
        "Ed: Listen, what's going on? What's wrong?",
        "Rick: Nothing's wrong, Dad. I'm fine. I was just taking a break. Do you want to get a ginger ale?",
        "Edmund: Okay, sure.",
        "Rick: Could I get a couple ginger ales, please? I'm almost ready to go back in. I just... We got to hit that dessert buffet line-- have you seen that?-- Before we leave.",
        "Ed: I'm worried about you.",
        "Rick: Dad, you have no idea what you're going to miss if you don't hit that dessert buffet line. Oh, come on. Will you just lighten up? I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm just... I was just sitting here thinking how lucky I am to be here.",
        "Ed: Unlike Richard Winslow, right?",
        "Rick: Yes.",
        "Ed: It is not your fault the man died.",
        "Rick: Dad, the fact is he did, and if he didn't die, I wouldn't be here.",
        "Ed: You don't even know that.",
        "Rick: Yes, we all know that. We all know that. I was watching Tammy and Cassie tonight, listening to people talk about Richard. He was one hell of a man, Dad.",
        "Ed: And so are you.",
        "Rick: But you have to say that. Dad, I want to deserve everything that has been given to me. Do you understand?",
        "Ed: Well, that explains the second job, doesn't it?",
        "Rick: When I took the job as M.E., Dad, I... I thought it was going to be temporary. I had no idea that my predecessor was going to be found drowned in a lake.",
        "Ed: Okay, this is what I worry about. You got two jobs now. That's a lot of stress for anyone.",
        "Rick: But the fact is I'm enjoying it. I'm having the best time of my life. You know that I've always toyed with the idea of forensic pathology, and I'm having a good time doing it.",
        "Ed: Then why don't you think about giving up the job at the hospital?",
        "Rick: Dad, no.",
        "Edmund: One or the other, Rick. One or the other-- not both.",
        "Rick: I'm still able to manage my time. I'm able to come home in time to read Jude his bedtime stories.",
        "Ed: You're going to do what you're going to do, so, you know...",
        "Rick: I've been given a second chance, Dad, and I'm not going to blow it.",
        "Ed: I hope you don't think I was interfering. I'm just, you know...",
        "Rick: I'm glad you're here to interfere, Dad. I really am. What do you say we get out of here?",
        "Ed: Yeah, that's a plan. Let's go.",

        "Harley: Oh! What are you doing sneaking up on people like that?",
        "Lloyd: I asked you a question.",

        "Cassie: I will talk to the staff and get you another drink, okay?",
        "Edmund: Alan?",
        "Alexandra: Of course it was Alan. It's his clever way of telling me he's here and he's keeping an eye on me.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Toys. Zach left some things here. He wanted me to bring them home.",
        "Lloyd: Ms. Spaulding was afraid something had happened. She heard a man's voice in the background when she was speaking to you.",
        "Harley: No, I was watching television. I told her that.",
        "Lloyd: Yes, well, she didn't believe you and quite frankly neither do I.",
        "Harley: You know what? I don't care what you believe. I'm the law. And you are what? Alex's secretary?",
        "Lloyd: Personal assistant.",
        "Harley: Okay, well, then why don't you go on ahead to the gala and assist. And I will stay here and watch the house. Otherwise you're intruding on a job I was hired to do by Alexandra.",
        "Lloyd: You were hired to protect the house, not ransack it.",

        "Reva: Okay, I will try to see it your way.",
        "Josh: Why would you want to do that?",
        "Reva: Because I don't want to fight anymore.",
        "Josh: (Laughs) Neither do I. Listen, what I said before about regrets, I didn't mean with us. I have wanted to live my whole life with you since the moment we met, darling.",
