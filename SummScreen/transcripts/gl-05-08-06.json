        "Tammy sets Cassie up with her college professor at Outskirts. Cassie is not pleased but agrees to stay to meet the man named Evan. When he tries to kiss her, she rattles off a long list of why their relationship would never work and leaves him sitting at the table. At the Main Street prom, Jonathan attempts to get information out of Ashley about Lizzie. She tells him that Lizzie is keeping something from her boyfriend. Jonathan gets her to drink some liquor from a flask. Lizzie happens to be at the same event and sees the two of them together. She gets Ashley's attention. Ashley tells Lizzie her new boyfriend's name is Nate. Lizzie tells Ashley that \"Nate\" is evil and nasty and not to tell him anything about her. Jonathan sees the two of them talking and he spikes Ashley's punch. He gets her drunker and asks more questions. Lizzie tells a teacher that Jonathan is trouble and the teacher calls Tammy who shows up at the prom. Jonathan makes up a lie to Tammy that he was rescuing Ashley from mean-spirited girls. Tammy falls for the lie. Lizzie sneaks into Ashley's office to destroy evidence of her medical records. Alan follows her and tells her he has made arrangements to get Henry out of her life.

        "Reva and Josh go to Company and meet with Rick and Mel. They introduce Josh and Reva to a new doctor, Colin McCabe, who is renting their apartment. Mel doesn't like him for he has no personality. Colin is Reva's oncologist and she is shocked to see him, but Colin does not tell anyone they have met. Josh is pleased to know Colin and tells him that he would like him on the project. After Colin and Reva are left alone, she thanks him for keeping their secret. He tells her that she needs to arrange for her records to be moved before Rick or Mel find them. Reva tells him snidely that she will see him at the Bauer barbeque.

        "Coop: Yeah.",
        "Rick: Well, you know what this means, right?",
        "Coop: What's that?",
        "Rick: That I'm really old and your life is over. It's not, it's not. I just... I haven't had a chance to talk to you since you and Lizzie... yeah, this is big.",
        "Coop: Yeah, this is really big.",
        "Rick: This is, yeah, it's pretty big, all right. And you probably have some father questions.",

        "Jonathan: I know.",
        "Ashlee: Lizzie never saw a doctor at the clinic.",
        "Jonathan: Well, then, why does the clinic have a record on her if she never saw a doctor? What is she doing?",
        "Ashlee: Could I have a picture with you, Nate? Please, come on. We can talk about this later.",
        "Jonathan: Okay, okay, okay, okay. We'll have a picture, but why don't we loosen up a bit first?",
        "Ashlee: Is that liquor?",
        "Jonathan: What's a prom without it, right?",

        "Ava: I'm really sorry that we couldn't do dinner.",
        "Coop: Yeah, me, too. I really didn't mean to cancel on you like that. It's just... but it was a Lizzie thing.",

        "Coop: Um... she's okay now.",
        "Ava: Did something happen?",
        "Coop: She just had some pains. So I took her to the hospital, and whatever it was seemed to pass, so... you know, there was a weird moment there, though, with the nurse. It's like when she found out that Lizzie and I, we weren't married and we weren't even together, she gave us this look-- I don't know what it was; it was like one of those, \"You're sinners.\"",
        "Ava: You know, people just need to learn how to mind their own business.",
        "Coop: You know what? We shouldn't even be talking about this. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring this up.",

        "Lizzie: What are you doing with him?",
        "Ashlee: Oh, Nate? Oh, no, he's my date. Wait, that rhymes: Nate, he's my date. Is he hot or what?",
        "Lizzie: No. No, absolutely not. Okay, look, it's just... we're cool, right? Okay, and I would be a really rotten friend if I didn't warn you that Nate is really big trouble.",

        "Lizzie: What do you mean \"excellent\"?",

        "Lizzie: You're not understanding me.",
        "Ashlee: What?",
        "Lizzie: Okay, look, he's not just a bad boy. He's evil. You can't trust him, like not at all, zero. Anything that you tell him, he's going to use against you. I've seen him in action.",
        "Ashlee: I'd like to see him in action.",
        "Lizzie: Listen to me! Okay, he will trash you just for kicks. You haven't told him too much about yourself-- your uncle, the clinic, anything?",
        "Ashlee: Well, it came up, you know. He seemed interested.",
        "Lizzie: What about me? Did he ask you anything about me?",
        "Ashlee: Believe it or not, not everything is about you, Lizzie. I mean, he's not automatically using me just 'cause he asked me a few questions.",
        "Lizzie: Hello! Why else would a guy care about a clinic?",
        "Ashlee: To make conversation. I mean, to get to know me. I mean, face... come on, face it. Maybe he just is into me. The last thing I want to do is spend my time with him talking about you. Talking... yeah, talking to him about you. Yeah, I... I won't say another word.",
        "Lizzie: Have you been drinking?",
        "Ashlee: ( Laughs )",
        "Jonathan: Hey! I missed you. Come on. Sit down.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: This isn't good. This is really, really, really, really, really bad. ( Dance music playing ) Mr. Lord, hey, like, you were so cool in English class. So I thought I should help you out. There is someone here at the prom tonight who really doesn't belong here. There.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Oh, I just realized I have a call to make... and paper to write. So excuse me.",

        "Evan: Sure.",
        "Cassie: You set me up?",
        "Tammy: Evan is so cool, Mom.",
        "Cassie: I don't care. Did I or did I not just tell you that I am not lonely? And people who try to set up people who don't want to be set up are really irritating people.",
        "Tammy: Okay, I'll give you that. But I already talked to Evan, so it's too late to cancel. Besides, I think you guys might really hit it off. He's cute, isn't he?",
        "Cassie: I don't care if he is George Clooney. I am not ready to enter into a relationship.",
        "Tammy: Okay, who said anything about a relationship? It's a date. What are you so scared of?",
        "Cassie: Nothing.",
        "Tammy: Okay, fine. Then you will have no trouble walking back over there and having a simple, nice time with an attractive, intelligent man.",
        "Cassie: And to think I paid for those psychology classes. All right, honey. I know what you're trying to do here, and not that I have to prove anything to you, but I will go through with this because you're right. It's no big deal. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Tammy: Hello.",

        "Mr. Lord: I hear you are involved with a young man named Jonathan Randall?",
        "Tammy: Yes, why?",
        "Mr. Lord: I'd appreciate it if you could come down to the Promenade on Main Street.",
        "Tammy: Is there trouble?",
        "Mr. Lord: I hope not. And I'd rather not bring the police into it.",
        "Tammy: Okay, I'll be right there.",

        "Mel: Nice drawing, Jude. I love it.",
        "Rick: So, no kiss for your hero? Ooh, boy. All right, what did I do wrong this time?",
        "Mel: Nothing, if you don't mind your husband renting the garage apartment to a complete stranger.",
        "Rick: Sweetheart, he may be strange, but he's not a stranger.",
        "Mel: Oh, what do you know about him? Besides the fact that he's not exactly Joe personality.",
        "Rick: He cooks and he cleans; that's huge. Besides, his father knows my father.",
        "Mel: Oh, then why don't we just invite his father to come live with us too?",
        "Rick: All right, sweetie, what is this really about? Our apartment is empty.",
        "Mel: I know.",
        "Rick: And now he can use it. What's the...?",
        "Mel: It's just... it's just that we don't have any time alone.",
        "Rick: I told you, I'm planning a trip to London for us. Now, look, he's new in town, he doesn't know anybody, he doesn't have a place to stay.",
        "Mel: Right, so it's the Bauers to the rescue.",
        "Rick: Why not? That's what we do best, isn't it?",

        "Rick: Oh, good. This is somebody you both should meet.",
        "Rick: Reva, Josh, this is Colin McCabe. Colin recently transferred from St. Louis General to join our staff at Cedars.",
        "Josh: Great, well, how are you doing? Nice to meet you. How do you like working at Cedars with this guy, huh?",
        "Colin: Oh, no complaints. I had a few difficult patients, but I handled them.",
        "Josh: Well, don't let him give you any golf tips, 'cause it's not pretty. ( Laughter ) Oh, you didn't get a chance to meet my wife.",

        "Rick: You're building a hospital?",
        "Josh: Well, it's going to will be a lot more than that. There will be rehab center, there will be housing, park, shops-- sort of a Mecca of healing for men and women who have served our country. It was my father's goal and something he wanted to do his whole life, and I get to be the one to follow through with it.",
        "Rick: That's fantastic.",

        "Ashlee: Yeah. Yeah, I guess.",
        "Jonathan: You know, I'm sorry. I... I didn't mean to ruin your prom night, and it was wrong of me to bring you into all this stuff with Lizzie. Why don't the rest of the night we just make it about us? You and me, that's all.",
        "Ashlee: Really?",
        "Jonathan: Uh-huh, and for the record, you have pretty nice eyes yourself.",
        "Ashlee: You're sad. You're worried about Lizzie.",
        "Jonathan: I don't know. You know, I'll fix it. I'll get it done somehow.",
        "Ashlee: I'll tell you what you want to know. Lizzie only pretended to be going to the clinic and seeing a doctor there.",

        "Tammy: You think?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Well, check it out. I was at the mall earlier, and I saw this girl there...",
        "Tammy: That girl?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, and there was like a bunch of chicks raging on her because she didn't have a date to the prom, and I was like, I'll just take her myself to shut those girls up.",
        "Tammy: So here you are, in your tux.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, well, call me a softie, call me nuts, but Ashlee's having fun.",
        "Tammy: She looks drunk.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, well, she was already buzzed at the mall, and that's another reason that I couldn't leave her there all messed up like that. I mean look at her.",
        "Tammy: Oh, well, you big softie. I guess you probably did make her night.",

        "Lizzie: Granddad, what are you doing here?",
        "Alan: When I saw you leave in your car from Main Street, I followed you here. Which begs the question, what are you doing in a clinic after hours when you know the Spaulding's don't go to clinics?",
        "Lizzie: Look, after I found out I was pregnant, I was too ashamed to tell anybody, so I came here. And then I started to worry, you know, maybe one of the staff would sell the story to a tabloid and I can see it now \"unwed Spaulding heiress carrying mystery love child.\"",
        "Alan: So you decided to get rid of the paper trail, correct?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. Yeah, that's it.",

        "Lizzie: We have been through this.",
        "Alan: Yes, and I'm happy to say that we are now through with it.",
        "Lizzie: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Alan: It means I have taken care of everything. Or I should say my lawyers have.",
        "Lizzie: How?",
        "Alan: Well, I instructed my lawyers to draw up a contract that will limit Mr. Bradshaw's contacts with you and the child to an absolute minimum. Believe me, he will cooperate.",
        "Lizzie: Granddad, kind of a smart move on your part as well. Coop is going to fight you every inch of the way. Which us going to make him realize how much he wants to be with me.",

        "Alan: But the man you love does not love you, nor does he deserve you. And believe me, it will be better when he is out of the picture permanently.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: That is crazy. I'm only go to see my kid every fourth weekend for a lousy four hours. What if I decide I want to drop by one day?",
        "Lawyer: That won't be permitted.",
        "Coop: You guys can't do that. You cannot do that.",
        "Lawyer: We'll be in touch.",
        "Ava: This towel is filled up with at least four of the food groups here. Here, check it out, look. What's wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mel: It's so nice seeing you guys together again.",
        "Josh: Thank you very much. And this time we're in it for the long haul, right, darling?",
        "Reva: It's better than it ever was.",
        "Rick: So what is it, like, guys to be empty-nesters?",
        "Reva: Well there are times when I miss my kids a lot, I do, but there's something to be said for it just being the two of us again, I mean the flexibility and the freedom.",
        "Josh: I totally agree-- not that I wouldn't want them to be part of the project of course.",
        "Reva: No, I mean we get to go wherever we want, whenever we want to go. It's that full bliss agenda, you know living fully in the moment every day.",
        "Rick: Boy, you guys sound like a couple of crazy teenagers. ( Laughter ) It gives hope to couples like us.",
        "Josh: There's a lot more where that came from, too, because we're going to be together for what, another 50 years, maybe?",
        "Reva: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evan: See, this isn't so bad, is it?",
        "Cassie: No, it's not bad at all.",
        "Evan: You have a wonderful smile. And, no, I don't say that to all of the girls.",
        "Cassie: Thank you. Ooh, I'm sorry.",
        "Evan: No, I'm sorry. Really. I tend to push things too fast.",
        "Cassie: No. I'm sure the kiss would have been fine, Evan. In fact, it would have been great, I'm sure, but with me, nothing starts slowly. It's one kiss, and wham, I am transported into la la land of love. So if you so much as brush your lips against mine, I'm gone. Before we know it, I'm moved in, and we have these big expectations of how perfect life is going to be. And a few months later we find out, no, it's not perfect. The truth is you can't live up to my expectations-- not that anybody could-- and it's another crushing blow, another devastating failure, another broken heart and I have done that dance, thank you very much. I'm going to sit this one out, but thank you. Let's go Dutch on this one.",

        "Ava: You're the father to Lizzie's baby, I mean, come on.",
        "Coop: Yeah, I'm the father. This is always going to be so complicated.",
        "Ava: Like my life has been easy and simple already.",
        "Coop: Ava, this-- all this-- this doesn't bother you.",
        "Ava: I just want you to be happy. Whatever that is.",
        "Coop: You're amazing. You know that?",
        "Ava: Sometimes.",
        "Coop: Look, I'm going to make some phones calls, get a lawyer of my own, tell me what rights I do have still.",
        "Ava: I'll hold down the fort until you get back.",
        "Coop: That is going to help me out a lot, actually. Thank you. All right, um, I'll see you later, okay?",
        "Ava: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: I don't want to hurt you. As a matter of fact, I want to do the opposite.",
        "Lizzie: I love Coop, Granddad. I want him. We -- we want him.",
        "Alan: I know you do, sweetheart. And this impending birth of your child is a miracle. Now, I wasn't around when your mother was pregnant with you, and I missed many moments with my other children, but I am not going to miss those moments now.",
        "Lizzie: You're excited to be a father again, aren't you?",
        "Alan: Yes. I'm going to be the best. And you're going to be a fabulous mother, too.",
        "Lizzie: You think so?",
        "Alan: Of course I think so. I told you many times, you can do anything you set your mind to do. But I want you to think about what I've told you about Mr. Bradshaw. I think you're going to realize that I'm telling you the truth, and that I'm right. It would be better off if he were out of the picture permanently. I'll see you later.",

        "Colin: If you are so determined to keep your condition a secret, you ought to remove your files from Cedars before Rick or Mel could absolutely run across them.",
        "Reva: No lecture to go along with the suggestion. No editorial comment.",
