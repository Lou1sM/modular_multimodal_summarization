        "Dinah: Edmund, forget it. Come on, you're going to have better luck sending a smoke signal.",
        "Edmund: Try holding it out your window, will you?",
        "Dinah: Edmund, come on. There's nothing happening out here. There's no signals happening. It's dead. Deadsville.",
        "Edmund: I'm glad you find this so amusing, dinah. Here we are in the middle of nowhere, hanging out in a broken-down van with no idea how far the nearest town is.",
        "Dinah: Edmund, chill. Jeffrey and cassie are going to find a gas station. The tow truck is going to be here before we know it. Put your feet up, relax. ( Thunder crashes )",
        "Edmund: Relax? Yes, of course, because nothing bad ever happens in an electrical storm.",
        "Cassie: The last time we were in a storm like this, we both almost died in a fire. Ow.",
        "Jeffrey: What? You all right?",
        "Cassie: Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.",
        "Jeffrey: What? What is it?",
        "Cassie: Ow, there's a rock in my shoe and it hurts really bad. ( Gasps )",
        "Jeffrey: Nice arm.",
        "Cassie: We're never going to make it, are we? We're never going to make it in time to catch alonzo.",
        "Jeffrey: Not if we just stand around here and talk about it.",
        "Cassie: Right. You're right. Will belongs with me, and alonzo is not going to take him away from me, okay? I can'T... I can't lose him.",
        "Jeffrey: Hey, I'm not going to let you lose him.",
        "Cassie: Okay. ( Thunder crashes ) ( gasping and grunting )",
        "Danny: Hey.",
        "Marina: Hey.",
        "Danny: I called buzz. He told me you were here.",
        "Marina: Yeah, I stopped by to see a friend who works here. Want a drink?",
        "Danny: Yeah, I could drink. But right now, all I really want is you.",
        "Harley: Gus.",
        "Mallet: Harley, take it easy.",
        "Harley: Oh, gus, you're okay!",
        "Mallet: Careful, careful, careful.",
        "Gus: Why does she have to take care... what's the matter with you?",
        "Mallet: There was a little incident. Don't worry about it. She's fine.",
        "Gus: Really? I thought you were supposed to be protecting her.",
        "Mallet: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing here?",
        "Harley: No, no, no. I'm okay. I'm okay. Are you okay?",
        "Gus: I needed to talk to you.",
        "Harley: Well, I was worried about you. Nobody knew where you were.",
        "Mallet: Excuse me. This is all very touching. What are you doing here?",
        "Gus: What, I shouldn't be here because you're doing such a great job protecting her?",
        "Mallet: Look, you just broke into my office. You're wearing, what, a stolen uniform? Last time I checked, both were federal crimes. So if you want to look out for harley, I think you're a little late.",
        "Gus: Listen, mallet. I think she's in a little more danger here than you realize, and this incident, it's probably just the beginning.",
        "Mallet: It's handled. I don't need you coming in here...",
        "Gus: What does that mean?",
        "Mallet: ...And making it worse.",
        "Gus: What does that mean, \"it's handled?\"",
        "Harley: You know what? I'm okay. I'm okay. Mallet brought me in here to protect me.",
        "Gus: I need to talk to you, okay? I need to talk to her alone.",
        "Mallet: No. Not a chance.",
        "Gus: Yes. As her attorney, I have the right to do that.",
        "Mallet: Come back during visiting hours.",
        "Gus: Oh, really? What are the visiting hours?",
        "Mallet: Did you read it? It's posted...",
        "Harley: You guys? You guys? Mallet, if he has some information that might be able to help me, don't you think that's worth just a couple of minutes?",
        "Mallet: ( Sighs ) are you sure you can handle this?",
        "Harley: Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.",
        "Mallet: Five minutes.",
        "Harley: Thanks.",
        "Mallet: Yeah. Aitoro? No more stunts.",
        "Harley: I'm so glad you're here. ( Knock on door )",
        "Mallet: Uh, come in.",
        "Guard: Warden? This was just sent over for you.",
        "Mallet: What the hell is this? Oh, no, no, no. No, no. They can't do this. Um... uh... watch this door, okay? Nobody comes in or out until i get back. Got me?",
        "Gus: What does that mean, some of the guards roughed you up?",
        "Harley: No, no, no, no, no. You first. Where have you been? My father couldn't find you. I was worried sick. I thought you were dead.",
        "Gus: This isn'T... I'm here now, all right? That's all that matters.",
        "Harley: No, no, no. Don't placate me. What happened?",
        "Gus: Alan locked me in a boiler room at spaulding.",
        "Harley: Your father is crazy. Who does that?",
        "Gus: He doesn't want me working on your case; he doesn't want me to clear your name. It's you he's after, not me, and I think he can do it from in here.",
        "Harley: Do you think those guards were working for alan?",
        "Gus: I don't know. I don't know, but we've got to work on a plan to protect you.",
        "Harley: We have a plan. Mallet is protecting me.",
        "Marina: You're a man on a mission.",
        "Danny: Yeah, well, funny you should say that, because I am thinking about going out of town.",
        "Marina: Oh.",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Marina: You're going to be with robbie and michelle. That's why you're here: To say good-bye.",
        "Danny: What? What?",
        "Marina: Wake up, marina.",
        "Danny: Hold up, hold up. Stop. Don't bug out. No, I'm talking about us-- you and me. I told you that we'd go away together.",
        "Marina: Yeah?",
        "Danny: Yeah. So, how about tonight? I was thinking we could just swing by your place. You can throw some stuff in a bag and we can drive to chicago, maybe get there in time to watch the sunrise over the lake.",
        "Marina: Now?",
        "Danny: Yeah, now. Why not?",
        "Marina: I mean, don't you think you've been through a lot, with tony, and michelle and robbie leaving?",
        "Danny: Yeah, but I can't really change anything that's happened. All I can do is get on with my life.",
        "Marina: Right this second?",
        "Danny: Why not?",
        "Marina: You're amazing... or crazy.",
        "Danny: Both, probably. So, are we going to go?",
        "Marina: No.",
        "Danny: Why not?",
        "Marina: Not tonight.",
        "Danny: Marina, I really want to be with you.",
        "Marina: And I really want to be with you, but if we take off tonight, the highlight of my evening is going to be tucking you in to some roadside motel. And with my luck, you snore.",
        "Danny: You really think I'd be able to sleep, with you in the same room?",
        "Marina: Yeah. You know what? Don't worry about rushing things on my account, okay? I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Danny: You sure?",
        "Marina: I promise. So, let's just...",
        "Danny: One step at a time.",
        "Marina: Yeah.",
        "Danny: Sounds good.",
        "Marina: Okay.",
        "Jeffrey: You're such a klutz, mrs. Winslow.",
        "Cassie: Me?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, you. Who else?",
        "Cassie: Oh.",
        "Jeffrey: You all right?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. What's wrong? Are you all right?",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, I'm fine. I'm going to see if I can get a signal out here.",
        "Cassie: Well, the storm's coming in.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, thanks a lot. I can see that. If I could just get a hold of my guys in washington, they can stall alonzo and stop him from leaving town.",
        "Cassie: But if we take too long doing this, we're not going to find a gas station that's open for you to fix the van so that we can get it back on the road.",
        "Jeffrey: I got a signal. I lost it.",
        "Cassie: Okay, I'm gone. I'm out of here.",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie...",
        "Cassie: No. See? No more stops. No more stops. Not for lightning, not for rocks in the shoe, nothing. Let's go.",
        "Jeffrey: You going to walk backwards all the way to dc?",
        "Cassie: Try and keep up, mr. O'neill.",
        "Jeffrey: Hey, wait up.",
        "Dinah: Gosh, I hope jeffrey and cassie don't get hit by lightning or anything.",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie wouldn't be out there at all if it weren't for you. She and I would be making this trip together, alone, in my car, which has a working engine.",
        "Dinah: Hey. Easy, big fellow.",
        "Edmund: I should be out there with her.",
        "Dinah: And then I would be all alone here with jeffrey, who has a way of getting me to talk, especially about secrets like the fact that you're playing both sides against the middle by getting alonzo to get will so you can look like a hero to cassie.",
        "Edmund: I'm doing what's best for cassie and will, and me. We belong together, and I'm going to do whatever it takes to make that happen.",
        "Dinah: You keep telling yourself that.",
        "Edmund: It's the truth.",
        "Dinah: Edmund, I see it. I understand. Look, cassie... she... she wanted to go to washington with jeffrey and not with you. I understand that you're under the gun, here. And it's obvious that jeffrey has the hots for cassie, and who knows what happened during their time together? And actually, now they are alone on a country road, walking...",
        "Edmund: I've got to get out of here. I'm going to take a look at that engine, see if I can get it started.",
        "Dinah: Hey, have you ever, like, looked under a hood of a car before?",
        "Edmund: Well... I've looked.",
        "Dinah: Ugh, lord. Get out of my way.",
        "Edmund: What do you think you're doing?",
        "Dinah: I am going to take a look at the engine. I know what I am doing. I spent my formative years stuffed into one of these things, traveling around the country. I know a thing or two about an engine.",
        "Edmund: Really? From the back seat?",
        "Dinah: I can also fix a ferris wheel, if you'd be interested. Now, get behind the wheel and I'll tell you when to start the engine.",
        "Edmund: Fine.",
        "Dinah: Where's a sledgehammer when you need it?",
        "Edmund: Should I try it now?",
        "Dinah: Sure, go ahead.",
        "Edmund: ( Sighs ) damn.",
        "Dinah: Did you do it?",
        "Edmund: Yes. Still dead.",
        "Dinah: Okay, let me try something else. ( Whispers ): Five, six, seven, eight. ( Normal voice ): Okay, give it a try.",
        "Edmund: Nothing.",
        "Dinah: Oh, really? I was sure that was going to work.",
        "Edmund: Dinah, what are you doing in there?",
        "Dinah: You know what, eddie? You do your job; I'm going to do mine, okay? I'm going to try one other thing here, with a cable, I learned a long time ago. Should work. Oh, nuts. ( Engine starts )",
        "Edmund: Hey! You did it, you did it, you did it. Oh!",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs )",
        "Edmund: Oh. I love you!",
        "Dinah: Oh. This was nothing.",
        "Edmund: Come on. The storm's coming in. We've got to find cassie.",
        "Dinah: When you finally give out, I hope they turn you into a toaster. ( Loud thunder )",
        "Cassie: Jeffrey, we can't stay here. I saw lights up ahead.",
        "Jeffrey: You saw lights way ahead, cassie. The storm is about to hit.",
        "Cassie: I'm not staying in here. Let's go.",
        "Jeffrey: Putting your life at risk is not going to do will any favors.",
        "Cassie: I'm not afraid of a storm.",
        "Jeffrey: Listen to the wind out there. ( Wind howling ) okay, if you go out there in the dark, you're going to get hit by something-- a falling tree branch, electrical wires. It's dangerous.",
        "Cassie: You're being dramatic, okay? I'll take my chances. What if the lights we saw up ahead were a garage? We've got to try it.",
        "Jeffrey: All right, just... just give it a few minutes, okay? It's going to pass.",
        "Cassie: You're really freaked out, aren't you?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, I'm reliving the night in the barn with your psycho husband who tried to kill me-- my brush with death. Okay. I think we're in luck here. Let there be light. Yeah. Okay. Not so bad.",
        "Cassie: Jeffrey, there's a phone.",
        "Jeffrey: Go for it.",
        "Cassie: There's no dial tone.",
        "Jeffrey: Mine's not working either.",
        "Cassie: Your phone hasn't worked since the van broke down.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, I know.",
        "Cassie: This is my chance to save my son, and I'm not going to be stuck in here because of some storm, okay?",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie, don't be stupid.",
        "Cassie: No! ( Wind howls )",
        "Jeffrey: I told you. ( Loud thunder ) ( crashing )",
        "Cassie: What was that?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, make yourself comfortable, mrs. Winslow, because I think we're trapped. ( Wind howling )",
        "Tammy: Hello, my hero. Are we ready to ride?",
        "Sandy: Not exactly.",
        "Tammy: Oh, let me guess. You sneezed and the whole car fell apart.",
        "Sandy: Well, my spare has a flat, too. I called roadside assistance. They said there would be an hour wait because we're a non- emergency.",
        "Tammy: Well, did you tell them we have a movie emergency, that we're trying to get to the late show?",
        "Sandy: Somehow I don't think that would work with the guys at the garage.",
        "Tammy: No, I guess not. Well, okay. We could call, um... who? My mom and edmund are on their way to washington right now.",
        "Sandy: I already called reva and josh's cell. They didn't answer. Hopefully they're having a better night than we are.",
        "Tammy: Um... we could call jonathan.",
        "Sandy: Gee. I'd really rather not. I'm sick of him making fun of my car, and I'm really not in the mood to let him be your hero.",
        "Tammy: Well, it would take more than one favor to make jonathan my hero. Anyway, we'll think of something. And in the meantime, what are you drinking? I'll buy.",
        "Sandy: Better and better. I'm supposed to be taking your mind off your troubles, and instead, you're buying me drinks at some bar in who knows where?",
        "Tammy: Think of it this way: I've been wanting to branch out and try new places. Who knows? This could turn into our new favorite hangout.",
        "Danny: Before we offend anybody, I think we should kind of maybe get out of here and go somewhere else.",
        "Marina: How about your apartment? Can you start your new life there?",
        "Danny: I think I can. Hold on.",
        "Marina: What?",
        "Danny: Something's not right.",
        "Marina: I want to be with you. I thought you felt the same way.",
        "Danny: I do, I do.",
        "Marina: So then let's go to your apartment.",
        "Danny: No, marina. Hold on. If I'm really starting my life over, I want it... I want to start it clean, and if I'm going to do that, there's something that you need to know.",
        "Frank: Mallet?",
        "Mallet: Hey, frank. You got a minute?",
        "Frank: Is this about harley?",
        "Mallet: Yeah. I think harley might be in trouble. I just got word from the state capitol. They want to transfer her to another facility.",
        "Frank: Away from you? Well, that would be a good thing, wouldn't it?",
        "Mallet: They're not sending her to camp cupcake.",
        "Frank: Hellis correctional? That's one of the toughest prisons in the midwest. Why would they do this to her? If they find out she's an ex- cop, that could be a death sentence. You can't let this happen to her.",
        "Mallet: I've been on the phone with the governor's people trying to get it reversed or at least a stay. They hung up on me.",
        "Frank: Well, why would they do this to harley? She hasn't caused any trouble since she's been inside.",
        "Mallet: We've got to figure out a way to stop this, frank. Damn it. I promised her I was going to protect her. Maybe she's right not to trust me again.",
        "Frank: Oh, no. You see, she trusted you once but you blew it.",
        "Mallet: I know that, frank. I know that. That's why I have to do this. I have to make it up to her. Man, I can't let her down again. ( Sighs )",
        "Frank: You're still in love with my sister, aren't you?",
        "Gus: Wait a second. Weren't you married to mallet? And didn't he betray you?",
        "Harley: Okay, mallet is doing his job as warden. He'd protect any of the other prisoners this way. This has nothing to do with our past.",
        "Gus: Oh, nothing. Right. Nothing at all.",
        "Harley: Don't you think this is an awkward time for you to start getting jealous?",
        "Gus: No, I am not being jealous, okay? This is not me being jealous. I'm just thinking, aren't you smart enough? Can't you figure the guy's playing you?",
        "Harley: Oh, yeah. You have got it all figured out. You, who hasn't been here at all.",
        "Gus: Hey, I know what I saw when I walked in this room.",
        "Harley: Oh, yes. You saw me wrapped in my ex- husband's arms, locked in his office all alone. You've got it all figured out. Hey, you know, as a matter of fact, mallet and I have been sending each other love letters all these years, hoping for the day when I might actually get arrested for murder and sent to prison so he could come up here and rescue me as warden. You thought this was hot? You should see us in the laundry room. Whoo!",
        "Gus: I did not come here to do this with you.",
        "Harley: You're being ridiculous.",
        "Gus: I'm being ridiculous? I was worried about you.",
        "Harley: I was worried about you! I didn't know where you were. No one knew where you were. I knew you disappeared. I was worried sick.",
        "Gus: Well, I'm here now, aren't I? Coming up on \"guiding light.\"",
        "Jeffrey: No one's going to take your boy away from you, and we're going to get out of here. I promise.",
        "Marina: You told me you still had feelings for her. You told me everything that night when you came to meet me at company.",
        "Danny: Not everything.",
        "Harley: Ow! ( Laughs ) I missed you.",
        "Gus: I love you so much. ( Knock on door )",
        "Guard: What's going on in there? ( Knocking on door )",
        "Harley: Get off me. What are we going to do?",
        "Gus: I'll take care of it, okay? I'll take it... I'm officer, um...",
        "Harley: Briscoe?",
        "Gus: Yeah, that's another story. Go. Hey.",
        "Guard: I heard a noise.",
        "Gus: Yeah, yeah. Thanks, uh, johnson. I was... I'm fixing the warden's computer, because I'm good at that and I got wrangled into it, and just dropped this whole thing. But I'll pick this up. But thank you for... thank you for checking on me. I'm just clumsy. Okay.",
        "Harley: You're good. ( Laughs )",
        "Gus: You're good.",
        "Frank: Admit it. You're still in love with my sister.",
        "Mallet: Come on, frank. Harley and I, we were over, what, years ago.",
        "Frank: No, no. I was there when you fell in love with her, okay? That was the real deal, and those feelings, they just don't go away.",
        "Mallet: All I want to do, frank, is protect her. That's it. I'm her warden. I have responsibilities to her and to the prison at large. Come on, we both know this order was a mistake. Are you going to help me find a way to beat it or not?",
        "Frank: Look, I don't know what we could do. I mean, yeah, you could stall the deal, but what? You know the routine. A transfer truck is going to pull up to your gates and you're going to have to put harley on it. What? What?",
        "Mallet: That's it.",
        "Frank: What's it?",
        "Mallet: Frank. Brother, you just saved your sister. Got to go.",
        "Marina: Okay, go ahead. Talk. Whatever it is, you can tell me.",
        "Danny: So many things have happened recently that maybe would have happened differently. I mean, if michelle had been honest with tony, and if I had maybe done things differently, then maybe he'd still be alive.",
        "Marina: I don't understand.",
        "Danny: Remember a couple of weeks ago when I asked you to go away with me?",
        "Marina: Right, the night that michelle got her memory back.",
        "Danny: Mm-hmm. Things happened so quickly that night. One minute the roof was falling in around us and michelle was unconscious, and then she was looking at me and she remembered everything, and she was michelle again. And it was like nothing had ever changed between us, like no time had passed.",
        "Marina: I know. You told me you still had feelings for her. You told me everything that night when you came to meet me at company.",
        "Danny: Not everything. When michelle remembered everything, it was very overwhelming. We both got very caught up in it and it was almost like... like an instinct took over and...",
        "Marina: Instinct?",
        "Danny: ( Sighs ) michelle and I slept together that night.",
        "Jeffrey: Come on, come on. ( Grunts )",
        "Cassie: Okay, what do you think?",
        "Jeffrey: What do I think? I think that lightning must have hit that tree outside the door and it fell down and it's blocking the door. That's what I think.",
        "Cassie: I can't believe we came all this way and we're stuck in a shed.",
        "Jeffrey: All right, well I'm going to get us out of here, okay?",
        "Cassie: How are you going to get us out of here?",
        "Jeffrey: Just give me a minute.",
        "Cassie: We don't have a minute. Jeffrey, we don't have a minute because alonzo's going to be on a plane back to san cristobel, and we're still going to be here in this shed.",
        "Jeffrey: What happened to that famous cassie winslow fighting spirit, huh?",
        "Cassie: Well, it's hopeless and you know that as well as i do. I cannot believe that I'm going to lose will. I can't believe that dinah marler is carrying my child.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, listen. You're not going to lose your boy no matter what happens, okay? And once dinah has that baby, that's going to be fine, too.",
        "Cassie: I never thought I'd have to give him up so soon, jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie, listen to me. No one is going to take your boy away from you, and we're going to get out of here. I promise. I won't let you down.",
        "Cassie: Edmund, how did you find us?",
        "Edmund: We saw the shed by the side of the road. Are you all right?",
        "Cassie: Yes. Yes. But how did you get here?",
        "Dinah: We fixed the van.",
        "Cassie: You fixed the van. Okay, so that means we still have time to get to washington?",
        "Edmund: Of course we do.",
        "Cassie: When it started lightning and thundering, you know, jeffrey saw this place.",
        "Dinah: Well, edmund must have been reading your mind, because he knew you'd be here. I'd miss the place, but hey, if it was up to me, you two would be here alone.",
        "Edmund: I think it's important to get cassie to washington, dc, while alonzo is still there, so we should go.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, I'll get the lantern.",
        "Cassie: No, you know what? I've got that.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay.",
        "Dinah: See you outside. ( Wind howls )",
        "Cassie: So, are we all set? ( Thunder rumbles )",
        "Edmund: Not quite.",
        "Tammy: I hate it when my mom's away and she doesn't pick up her phone.",
        "Sandy: Well, it's not like she could help us if she did. I'm starting to think hitchhiking is the way to go.",
        "Tammy: Could be fun. I've never done that.",
        "Sandy: And you never will. Not while you're with me.",
        "Tammy: You know, I wasn't even going to tell my mom that we're stranded. I just wanted to check on her and make sure she's okay. She's been so upset about alonzo wanting to take will back to san cristobel.",
        "Sandy: Have you thought about maybe moving back in with your mom? Give her some moral support?",
        "Tammy: I've thought about it. But you know, at the same time that I want us all to be okay, i really feel like I'm at a stage in my life where I need to protect my life, figure out my life. I do miss being home sometimes, though. What about you? Do you miss living with your family?",
        "Marina: You and michelle...",
        "Danny: Okay, marina, I really debated whether or not I should even tell you, but I just didn't want there to be any secrets between us.",
        "Marina: But you came back that night and you acted like everything was the same between us.",
        "Danny: Oh... marina, I'm telling you because I want to be with you.",
        "Marina: For how long?",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Marina: Tonight, since michelle is not here?",
        "Danny: No.",
        "Marina: Or just until she gets back from africa, or...?",
        "Danny: Michelle... michelle and I are over. What happened with us that night was... I don'T... it was about the past.",
        "Marina: Even if that's true...",
        "Danny: It is true. It is true. Look, I don't expect you to understand. I just... I didn't want tonight to happen... I didn'T... i couldn't be with you for the first time without you knowing.",
        "Marina: You're right. What am I even doing here with you? I'm going home.",
        "Danny: No, no, no. Marina, don't go. Please.",
        "Marina: No.",
        "Danny: Please.",
        "Marina: You know what I don't understand, is why you didn't just let me take a step back. I offered to let you be with michelle, to give it that chance. It was a really hard thing for me to do, but I just wanted us to be honest with each other. So much for that.",
        "Danny: I'm sorry.",
        "Marina: You know, I'm not... I'm not even upset that you slept with michelle. I mean, I am, but the worst part of it is, is that you went all this time and didn't even say anything.",
        "Danny: You're right. You're right. You deserved much better.",
        "Marina: This is your problem, not mine. You need to figure this out.",
        "Danny: Marina, I have figured it out. I know what I'm doing. I... I have moved on. I've let michelle go.",
        "Marina: No, danny, she was going whether you wanted her to or not.",
        "Danny: Well, but I could have followed her, but I didn'T. I stayed here because I want to be with you.",
        "Marina: It's not enough. I need to figure out where I fit in to all this. I mean, if anything like this were to ever happen again, would you choose me over her? Or are we just kidding ourselves?",
        "Danny: Marina...",
        "Marina: No. You know what? Don'T. Don't call me. Don't come after me. Just leave me alone.",
        "Harley: You're really here this time, right? You're not just in my mind?",
        "Gus: No, I'm here. I don't know if you remember, but I told you nobody could keep us apart forever. But then you pushed me away. But then your father told me that you wanted to talk to me, so...",
        "Harley: Oh, that's right. Yes, because I remember something about the night of the murder.",
        "Gus: Well, great. Is it about the killer?",
        "Harley: I don't know. It was a perfume scent.",
        "Gus: Yeah, yeah?",
        "Harley: And footsteps. Somebody was there. Somebody was at company that night. It was a scent, a strong scent like jasmine.",
        "Gus: Jasmine. That's good, that's good. That's traceable.",
        "Harley: I know it's not much, but...",
        "Gus: No, it could be everything, it could be nothing. Whatever. Listen, I promise you, I'm going to get you out of here, okay? I'm going to get you out of here, away from this danger, away from the guards. I promise. ( Knock on door )",
        "Mallet: Sorry, guys. Visit's over.",
        "Dinah: Well, it's too bad that edmund insisted on investigating tonight. You could have been stuck in a shed with cassie all night, or even longer.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, it's a good thing you came along when you did, isn't it?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, well, if you say so. Hope we didn't blow your chance with cassie.",
        "Cassie: I, um... I can understand if you're upset, you know. This trip has been pretty hard on everybody.",
        "Edmund: It doesn't matter, as long as we accomplish what we set out to do.",
        "Cassie: Look, um, you know, when it started to thunder and lightning, I wanted to keep going, but jeffrey thought we should come here.",
        "Edmund: I'm glad. I'm glad he found a place for you to ride out the storm. And I know it must have been very frustrating for you to be trapped in here. But you're all right now, right?",
        "Cassie: Yes, right. No. I'm not. I am so terrified, edmund, that I'm going to lose will, and...",
        "Edmund: Cassie, alonzo is not going to take will away from you. I promise you that. I am going to do whatever it takes to make sure he doesn'T. All right?",
        "Cassie: I know you will. I know you will.",
        "Edmund: Come on, let's go.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. ( Storm rages )",
        "Tammy: Well, do you miss living with your family?",
        "Sandy: Um, I like to live in the present, and nothing is as great as the present that I have now. I have a great job, a great girl. I think I see lights. Maybe the roadside assistance is here.",
        "Tammy: Great timing. Oh, well. We have a long ride ahead of us. You can answer all my questions on the way home.",
        "Sandy: All right. Well, let's get you out of here. If you haven't noticed, every guy in this place has been checking you out.",
        "Tammy: Really? Maybe I should come back sometime. Joke. Ha-ha.",
        "Sandy: Come on.",
        "Danny: Good move, santos.",
        "Frank: Hey, honey.",
        "Marina: Hey, daddy.",
        "Frank: I thought you were going to go over to see danny.",
        "Marina: I did.",
        "Frank: Is everything okay?",
        "Marina: Yep.",
        "Frank: Do you want to talk about it?",
        "Marina: Nope.",
        "Frank: Um, is it okay if i just sit here next to you?",
        "Marina: I'd like that.",
        "Frank: Me, too.",
        "Mallet: Well, I'll have to write you a pass out of here so nobody gets suspicious.",
        "Gus: Thank you.",
        "Harley: Um, we just need a few more minutes.",
        "Mallet: I'm sorry. The guard already knows something's going on.",
        "Harley: Do you have everything you need?",
        "Gus: We'll see.",
        "Mallet: You need to get out of here; I need to make a phone call. And say your good-byes out there. Let's see. Yeah, hi. This is warden mallet. About the prison order I got tonight, a prison transfer for a ms. Harley cooper? Yeah. No, I can'T... I think there's some kind of mix-up. She's already... she's gone. I can't send her to hellis. No, listen... no, listen to me. She transferred out already. Okay, I don't have a prisoner by that name on my list anymore. Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah, I'm sure. Listen, you guys screwed up, not me. Do that. Thank you.",
        "Harley: So maybe next time you could impersonate a prisoner and stick around.",
        "Gus: Sure. All-women's prison. That would be any guy's fantasy.",
        "Harley: Hey, well, you look great in a dress.",
        "Gus: Right. Well, I guess the next time I'll see you is at the release gate. Try to protect her, all right?",
        "Mallet: Good-bye, gus.",
        "Harley: Listen, mallet...",
        "Mallet: It... it's fine.",
        "Harley: I was just going to say thanks for taking...",
        "Mallet: Harley, you know what? It's okay. It's all right. I've just got other things on my mind.",
        "Harley: Well, what?",
        "Mallet: I got an order tonight to transfer you to another facility.",
        "Harley: Why?",
        "Mallet: Don't worry about it, okay? It's not going to happen.",
        "Harley: How are you going to keep that from happening?",
        "Mallet: I think I already have. I'm not going to let you go. You're going to stay here, with me. Next, on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Mallet: I'm going to hide you in here.",
        "Harley: Well, wait. Then I can'T... I can't see my family, or gus.",
        "Mallet: No, no one. Except me.",
        "Gus: You locked me in there and you were threatening harley. Well, I think it's a whole new world now, don't you?"
