        "Gus and Harley are blackmailed by a man showing them pictures of Gus at the cabin when he was getting off drugs. Harley makes the man give her the pictures and negatives after telling him that she will ruin his life. He leaves and phones someone telling them, \"Mr. Spaulding? Yes, they are rattled\". Beth tries to convince Coop to fight Alan about the visitation rights. Coop tells a hurt Ava that he and Lizzie will figure out what to do with their lives and she needs to move on. Jonathan follows Lizzie to the clinic and finds her destroying her medical records. He pins her down, threatening to call Coop about the baby's true father and she finally lies and convinces a very relieved Jonathan that Coop is the real father.",
        "Gus finds Billy at Company and begins to tell him about his pill problem. Billy asks why he is telling him and Gus tells him, \"I can't tell my wife\". Ashley tells Tammy that she thinks \"Nate\" has something going on with Lizzie. Lizzie tells this to Jonathan and he lies, telling her that he was just trying to make Ashley feel better and wanted to keep Tammy out of \"stuff\". Dinah tries to get Harley to help her find Ross's murderer. Harley refuses. Blake goes to Mallet and tells him that she wants more to be done to find Ross's murderer. He tells her to leave Dinah out of everything or she will have to cross him. Dinah returns to the apartment and Blake tells her that she wants to take her to a spa. As the closing music plays, she whispers to Dinah, \"Once we get out of here, no one can stop us from taking down together whoever killed Ross\". Dinah looks at her, knowingly and tells Mallet that she needs a massage and is getting her suitcase. As she leaves the room, she shoots Blake an affirmative glance."

        "Mallet: Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah someone's in the kitchen I know-oh someone's in the Dinah... -- hey, come in here and help me wash my back.",
        "Dinah: All right, I'll be right there. Let me just do something, okay? Hey, Blake, it's me. I'm giving you a call because pretty much I think you're the only person that would understand. You know, losing daddy... losing daddy was tough and awful. And it's one thing when they tell you it's an accident, but to think that someone took him from me, that's another... I've been admittedly angry my whole life, but I'm focusing my anger now, and it has a name and a face, and it's Alan-Michael. And Alan-Michael has done a lot of things that people don't know about. I guess it doesn't matter, but I know that the police are going to deal with this the way they're going to deal with it. And I have a life and a job and an incredible guy who means everything to me, everything, and I don't understand why I'm so angry. ( Answer machine beeps )",
        "Blake: I'm angry, too, Dinah.",

        "Gus: Hi.",
        "Harley: Hey. Who's our guest?",
        "Gus: This is Eddie Gibson. He works in photography.",
        "Harley: Okay.",
        "Gus: I was thinking if he's any good, maybe we could a portrait done with the kids.",
        "Gibson: Here are some samples of my work. I guess you can call me more of a collector than a photographer. And I get pictures published for magazines.",
        "Harley: What is this?",
        "Gus: Where'd you get these?",
        "Gibson: That's not important, Mr. Aitoro. The important thing is these pictures never see the light of day. So I was thinking maybe we could work something out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: I am not trying to say she is an unfit mother. I'm not trying to have a custody battle; I just want to be able to see my kid. No, the baby has not been born yet. No, we are not married. Yes. Because I've already been served with the papers. Elizabeth Spaulding, the name is-- hello? Hello? Son of a... ( crashing sound )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Jonathan!",
        "Ashlee: This place is cool!",
        "Tammy: Okay. Sit down right over here. You need to have got to have some coffee.",
        "Ashlee: I don't want any. Where's Nate? He is so cute. You think he likes me?",
        "Tammy: I'm... not sure. So why did Nate leave you? Hello, Ashlee?",
        "Ashlee: Clinic.",
        "Tammy: Clinic?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Hey, those are--",
        "Jonathan: What's the deal, Lizzie? You're in the clinic all alone, you got the shredder all fired up. You got something you don't want anyone else to see.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. I lied about the baby, but you're not going to like the truth.",
        "Jonathan: You lied. You weren't pregnant when we slept together, were you?",

        "Ava: Oh.",
        "Coop: Hey.",
        "Ava: Hey. It looks like we have to go back to work.",

        "Ava: Yeah.",
        "Coop: How are you? Are you...",
        "Ava: Yeah-- well, I have a cold. Um... I think we better do something about that fist of yours.",
        "Coop: I don't--",
        "Ava: Keeps chopping through the wall.",
        "Coop: Oh. No, I'm sorry. Look, I'm just not feeling myself right now. I've been going over the papers Alan's lawyers sent over here. I'm making phone calls and I'm trying to figure out a way--",
        "Ava: If I can help you, please, let me know. Anything-- I mean...",
        "Coop: Look, don't worry about it.",
        "Ava: Wait, let me help. At least let me make some phone calls or something. I mean you're not going to win a metal by doing this by yourself.",
        "Coop: Whatever's going on, okay, I don't want you to be a part of it, okay. Whatever's going on between Lizzie and me, it's our mess. Please.",
        "Ava: I thought I was stuck in the middle of it.",
        "Coop: Look, Lizzie and I will figure it out, okay?",
        "Ava: Right, sure.",
        "Coop: Yeah.",

        "Lizzie: I know what this looks like, but it isn't what you think?",
        "Jonathan: Then tell me what it isn't, Lizzie, because from where I'm standing, it looks like you're trying to lie about the day you conceived.",
        "Lizzie: If I didn't get the dates just right, the doctor would've-- they would have denied my insurance.",
        "Jonathan: You're a Spaulding, you don't need insurance. Look, I've told more lies in more ways than you've ever dreamed of. You are not going to con me. What did you do? Fine. Let's call Coop. He and I can compare notes, dates, intimate details about where you have your birth mark. Cool with you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ashlee: But I don't want anymore coffee. Do you have any chai?",
        "Tammy: All right, you were telling me about the clinic, Ashlee.",
        "Ashlee: I was?",
        "Tammy: Did Jonathan have to go to a doctor or something?",
        "Ashlee: Who's Jonathan?",
        "Tammy: I mean Nate.",
        "Ashlee: Oh, Nate. He's so cool; he's classic cool. He's like James Dean. Can I tell you a secret?",
        "Tammy: What?",
        "Ashlee: He's coming back for me. I'm so excited. We should-- oh, we're not on Main Street anymore, are we? Oh, wait. I should get back; I really don't want to miss him.",
        "Tammy: You know what? It's getting kind of late.",
        "Ashlee: I know. I don't want the night to end. I... did he say he was coming here? I really should surprise him, like... I should get on the bar or something. ( Laughs ) That'll be so fun, and like dance.",
        "Tammy: Okay, no, no, no. You know what, somehow I don't think that's really going to surprise him, you doing that. All right.",
        "Ashlee: It doesn't matter. Just so long as long as we can pick up where we left off.",
        "Tammy: Okay. Ashlee, here's the plan, all right? I'm going to get you sober enough that you can take a cab home. I think you and Nate are done for the night.",
        "Ashlee: Did he say that? No, no, it's prom. It's prom and I have the coolest date. We like bomded--- bonded. We connected. This is going to be the start of something big.",
        "Tammy: And yet he is nowhere to be seen.",
        "Ashlee: That was rude. Hey, so, do you think I should play hard to get? Maybe for like a minute? ( Laughing ) Oh. Oh, so you should really leave, I guess, because we're going to need our privacy. I'm going to let Nate make it up to me.",
        "Tammy: Oh, no you're not.",
        "Ashlee: Why, jealous?",
        "Tammy: Oh, God, Ashlee.",
        "Ashlee: What?",
        "Tammy: I think it's time for you to get a reality check about your dream date.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Oh, my gosh, please stop. Have I told you I'm the luckiest girl in the world.",
        "Mallet: Yes, you are, you're very lucky. Does this feel good? You okay?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I'm okay. You know, earlier when I was dozing off, I had a dream about my dad. He came to me, which was amazing. He just... he had this beautiful smile and this look in his eye, you know, this warmth. And he just-- he didn't say anything. He just glowed, full of light. And then as I caught myself waking up, it was like he was being pulled away from me. But I expected to feel cold or strange, but I didn't. Actually, I don't know, I felt even worse than that. I felt like I was in this hole. It was as if he took all of that light and that warmth with him, and I had no hope, and I had nothing.",
        "Mallet: You know that light from your father, it's still here, you know. It's around you. It's right here.",
        "Dinah: You're right. I know that, I know that and I know that's all that matters.",
        "Mallet: And I think Ross would be really proud of you for not letting his death rob you of your life, you know. And you haven't let your bitterness and your anger take away the good things in your life.",
        "Dinah: You're absolutely right. ( Laughing ) Hey, you got anything to go with that rum?",
        "Mallet: I never got around to it.",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs ) Well, if I can have my leg back, I'll fix that. ( Laughing ) Yeah, let me go fix some mixers. Honey, you just rest, okay.",
        "Mallet: All right.",
        "Dinah: Thank you. You know you're a prince. Thank you.",
        "Mallet: Thank you.",
        "Dinah: I'll be right back.",
        "Mallet: All right.",

        "Gus: All right, so who sent you? Hmm? And how did you know where to find me?",
        "Gibson: It's my business to know, sir.",
        "Harley: Don't call it business; it's blackmail.",
        "Gibson: I could have gotten it published. I'm doing you a favor. Now for a small fee, you can count on me to keep quiet about the fact that you ditched out of rehab after just one day.",
        "Gus: How much you want?",
        "Gibson: I knew we could reach an agreement.",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Gibson: No? Perhaps I'm not being clear.",
        "Harley: No, no, no, we heard you. The answer's no.",
        "Gibson: Okay. Well if that's the way you want it, I can make more on these in the open market.",
        "Harley: Just give me the pictures; give me the negatives.",
        "Gibson: Lady, I don't think you get it.",
        "Harley: Oh, I get it. Now it's your turn. Maybe you are forgetting who you're dealing with. My name is Harley Cooper, but you already know that. What you're forgetting is who I am, what I do, and all of the resources available to me at my disposal. And what you should be saying to yourself right about now is: This woman is CEO of Spaulding Enterprises. Is there anything they can't do? The answer, in fact, is no. See, I will make it my business to know everything there is to know about you. You, your friends, your family, your wife. I'll know about your credit history; I'll know about your bank account. I will know everything there is about your tiny little existence and then I will piece by piece, bit by bit, tear apart everything that you care about. And I will enjoy myself doing it.",
        "Gibson: You can't?",
        "Harley: Yes. Yes I can. So give me the pictures, give me the negatives, in fact, give me the camera, while you're at it.",
        "Gibson: Yeah, Mr. Spaulding? It's Gibson here. Definitely. They definitely seemed rattled. Don't worry about it. You made it worth my while.",
        "Gus: I've never seen you like that.",
        "Harley: Yeah. Where are you going?",
        "Gus: To make sure he actually leaves the building.",
        "Dinah: Knock, knock.",
        "Harley: Come in. Hey. Dinah, I have not... I haven't seen you in a while.",
        "Dinah: Since Mallet was shot.",
        "Harley: Yeah.",
        "Dinah: I'm sorry I was so wacko that day. I'm sorry I came after you the way I did.",
        "Harley: No, I'm just sorry that something like that happened between us. Can we just forget about it?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, yeah, you bet. Look, I've come to you to ask for some help. I know that because you're my friend, you're going to come through for me.",
        "Harley: Anything you need.",
        "Dinah: It's about my father.",

        "Mallet: Blake?",
        "Blake: Hey.",
        "Mallet: Dinah just stepped out a minute ago. If you're here for a campaign contribution, I already gave at the office.",
        "Blake: So, Mallet, why aren't you on the job, tracking down leads about Ross's plane crash? Isn't that what the city pays you for?",
        "Mallet: I kind of got shot.",
        "Blake: Right. You got shot, which means you're on the right track. So I just want to know what else is being done in this investigation. Are you the only investigator in this case?",
        "Mallet: No.",
        "Blake: Because it doesn't seem like you're doing a very adequate job. And you're not leaving me and Dinah any options.",
        "Mallet: Hold it. Wait a minute, okay. You only have one option: To let the police do their job. We're not your personal security force.",
        "Blake: Well, perhaps I should get one.",
        "Mallet: Excuse me? Meaning what?",
        "Blake: Nothing.",
        "Mallet: No, I hope nothing. What did you come over here to talk to Dinah about?",
        "Blake: Nothing. Nothing at all.",
        "Mallet: No, the truth, Blake. I want to know the truth. What are you looking for, huh? You looking for justice or revenge?",
        "Blake: Why not both?",

        "Beth: Coop. Coop.",
        "Coop: Oh, let me guess, you're just following up after Alan's attack dog of a lawyer, right? You coming to pick on the carcass?",
        "Beth: No, no, no, no. I'm here to tell you that I think that what Alan is doing is wrong.",
        "Coop: You're defying your husband?",
        "Beth: Defying? No, no, no. I don't defy. Lizzie is my daughter. I make up my own mind.",
        "Coop: All right. Um... what are you here to say, Beth?",
        "Beth: The agreement that Alan wants would give you minimal rights to Lizzie's baby.",
        "Coop: It's my baby, too.",
        "Beth: Exactly. Exactly. I know. And I want to help you, I do. For the baby's sake. And I will help you. But what I can do is nothing compared to what you can do yourself.",
        "Coop: Now what does that mean?",
        "Beth: You can take Alan on and beat him. You interested?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Okay, Ashlee. Look, I don't want to be mean, but I don't think you're seeing the whole picture here.",
        "Ashlee: Wait, you're not jealous, your Nate's cousin. I forgot. Wait, wait. Could you help me out with him?",
        "Tammy: All right, first of all, let's get a few names straight, okay?",
        "Ashlee: All right.",
        "Tammy: Nate's Jonathan's father's name.",
        "Ashlee: Wait, who's Jonathan?",
        "Tammy: That's Nate's real name.",
        "Ashlee: Oh. But why would he give me a fake name?",
        "Tammy: Well, forget about that for a minute, okay. It's not important. He was trying to do you a favor.",
        "Ashlee: What?",
        "Tammy: Taking you to the prom.",
        "Ashlee: How do you even know this? How would you know any of this?",
        "Tammy: I know this because Jonathan is my boyfriend. I live with him, right here.",
        "Ashlee: You live here? In a bar?",
        "Tammy: For now.",
        "Ashlee: Wait, I thought you said you guys were cousins?",
        "Tammy: We are.",
        "Ashlee: Eww.",
        "Tammy: Listen, I know about him taking you because you had no prom date. And he's a nice guy, okay. All right, well, maybe not nice, exactly, but he does have a soft spot for people in trouble.",
        "Ashlee: That's what he told you? That I was some loser, he found?",
        "Tammy: No, no, he didn't say that. I just think you should step back and look at the truth.",
        "Ashlee: The truth? I can tell you about the truth. I can tell you about the real reason why he wanted to spend all of this time with me in the first place.",

        "Jonathan: Then tell me the truth!",
        "Lizzie: He loves this baby; he's going to figure out that he loves me, too. It's just going to take some time.",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie, you're stalling. You're stalling.",
        "Lizzie: If you call him, you're going to ruin everything.",

        "Lizzie: I went to an abortion clinic. I didn't do anything, obviously, but that wasn't going to help me with Coop.",
        "Jonathan: Why didn't you just tell him the truth the whole time from the beginning?",
        "Lizzie: Okay. By the time I found out I was pregnant, Coop was so over me. It was the darkest day of my life, okay. I was totally alone.",
        "Jonathan: Sorry, but... well, you didn't do anything, right? So it's all good.",
        "Lizzie: You mean it's all good for you and Tammy.",

        "Jerry: No, I was making a bad joke about having ten buzz burgers, which would give anybody a coronary, which I guess isn't very funny-- which is why I made a joke, but clearly you don't think it's...",

        "Harley: I know. But Gus is working on this thing. He'll solve it.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, maybe, but Frank and Mallet and Gus sometimes can't do everything.",
        "Harley: What are you saying?",
        "Dinah: What I'm saying is I'm not going to sit on the sidelines. You're about the only person who can help me around here.",
        "Harley: You know I don't have my badge anymore, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: You've got more than a badge, Harley. You've got Spaulding resources.",
        "Harley: Okay.",
        "Dinah: I need access to the jet, to the servers, to the labs, to the politicians in D.C. that you guys support. I don't have much to go on here, but I think if we keep throwing resources at this thing, that I will generate leads, definite leads.",
        "Harley: And what will you do if you get a lead?",
        "Dinah: I haven't thought about that yet.",
        "Harley: You sure.",
        "Dinah: Look, Harley, I'm coming to you as a friend.",
        "Harley: And I'm being your friend; just listen to me. Your father, the man who never failed you, who always believed in you was possibly murdered, and you're asking me to believe that you haven't given one thought to what you will do if you should find that killer? Dinah? Word on the street is that Alan-Michael might be involved.",
        "Dinah: Whoever.",
        "Harley: I think we both know that you will take matters into your own hands.",
        "Dinah: This is my father we're talking about here.",
        "Harley: You are asking me to drag the company into the biggest scandal this town has seen in years.",
        "Dinah: Nobody has to know what we're thinking, what we're doing, what--",
        "Harley: No, you don't know what you're asking. You don't know what you're asking.",
        "Dinah: I am asking my friend to help me here.",
        "Harley: No, no. Because a friend doesn't ask another friend to get into a position like this. I'm sorry, my answer's no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Why are you here?",
        "Blake: I'm here because Ross was Dinah's father.",
        "Mallet: No, I think you came over here to rev Dinah up and watch her spin off like a top, maybe get her to do your dirty work, huh?",
        "Blake: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Mallet: Let her be the loose cannon, risk everything for revenge, get her to be the one that lashes out. After all, that's what she's good at, right.",
        "Blake: I didn't say that.",
        "Mallet: No, but that's what everybody thinks. But I'm here to tell you, you are wrong. Because that's not who she is. That's not who she is anymore, so I'm not going to let you play with her head, okay? You're hurting; I understand that, but that does not justify you dragging Dinah down with you.",
        "Blake: Mallet.",
        "Mallet: You leave Dinah alone. Just keep her away from whatever you've got planned, because widow or not, you will regret crossing me.",
        "Dinah: I am asking you to help me find the person who killed my father.",
        "Harley: Exactly. This is what I'm talking about. Somebody could get hurt. Have you thought about that?",
        "Dinah: Mallet. Mallet got hurt, Harley. He got a bullet in his arm because your husband was too messed up not to cover his partner's back. And I covered for you in front of your brother, and this is what I'm getting now?",
        "Harley: Is this what we're going to do now? We're going to keep score all the time?",
        "Dinah: No, I'm saying that I am clearly seeing right now who my friends are. And you talk to me about how much you admire me, but that is all crap.",
        "Harley: That's crap, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: No, let me tell you something, you're not even talking to me about how to figure this thing out with me. It is a simple no with you. You are something else. You are something else. ( Door slams )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: I don't give my number out at work.",
        "Jerry: You don't?",
        "Ava: No.",
        "Jerry: Well, then you call me. Here's my card at the station. Look, I really enjoyed meeting you. And if you felt any kind of connection at all, why don't you give me a call.",
        "Coop: What was that about?",
        "Ava: That was just some dude asking me out. I mean, can you believe that?",
        "Coop: Of course I can believe it. You're... you. I think you should call the guy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Hey.",
        "Dinah: Hi. Blake, what are you doing here?",
        "Mallet: Blake was just leaving.",
        "Blake: No, actually, Dinah I wanted to talk to you.",
        "Mallet: No, I think you were leaving.",
        "Blake: No, because I feel that we could both use a little stress relief, and I wanted to invite you to a spa. A day spa. Maybe out of town, up in Chicago. I just think we could both use it. Take the time to bond, get our mind off things.",
        "Mallet: Oh, man.",
        "Dinah: A spa? I'd rather sit in the middle of the road and get hit by a mac truck.",

        "Jonathan: Hey, you okay by yourself?",
        "Tammy: Mm-hm. I had Ashlee to keep me warm.",
        "Jonathan: Ashlee?",
        "Tammy: Yeah, I went back to Main Street to ask you a question, but you were gone, so... Ashlee was plastered, so I brought her back here to sober up, and she started blabbing.",
        "Jonathan: What was she blabbing about?",
        "Tammy: She seems to think that you and Lizzie have a thing for each other. Any idea why she might even think of something like that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: I don't want to call that guy, Coop.",
        "Coop: Look, he seemed like he was a nice guy, all right? Good-looking, he's a cop. Why don't you just go for it?",
        "Ava: Why don't you just stop talking like this. I don't want to call him. Some other girl might want to call him, but I don't want to.",
        "Coop: Why?",
        "Ava: Because he's not you.",
        "Coop: Ava, I just want to be fair to you. All right. This whole situation is pretty unfair. Everything about it is unfair to everybody. I don't want to do it anymore. I'm not-- I'm not able to give you what you deserve. Call the guy. Ava, if you're not going to call him, just call somebody. Please. Come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: It's me. Listen, you have got to come up with better stuff on Ava. What am I paying for? Ah, ah, no, don't talk. No excuses. Find something good and find it fast. I've got to get her out of Coop's life, like yesterday.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Ashlee said that Lizzie and I--",
        "Tammy: Yeah. But why Lizzie, that's strange.",
        "Jonathan: No, not really, actually, no.",
        "Tammy: What do you mean?",
        "Jonathan: I don't know, I uh... I kind of wanted her to think that Lizzie and I--",
        "Tammy: Lizzie and you what?",
        "Jonathan: I mean I only went to the high school prom to give this girl a break. Her life was imploding, so I figured I'd help her, right. And then at dinner, I just started dropping hints that Lizzie and I-- whatever-- so that the girl wouldn't get too attached.",
        "Tammy: Why didn't you just tell her about me?",
        "Jonathan: Because, I don't want to play games where you're involved. You know, I want to keep you at arm's length from everything that happened tonight. I want to wake up tomorrow morning and have it be just us. You know, no stories, no prom hangovers. I'm not going to let anything happen to us, Tammy. You know that, right? Hmm?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: Dinah, I know you're excited because Mallet's investigation is about to pop, and you think that you should be here. But actually, it's the best time for us to get out of here. Let these guys solve the case without looking over their shoulders trying to wonder how we're reacting. We're going to get our answers faster. And isn't that what we both want?",
        "Dinah: Did you put her up to this?",
        "Mallet: Um, no, I didn't. But, um, maybe it's not a bad idea.",
        "Blake: Dinah, come with me. You need the break. We both need the break. Actually, we need each other. Once we get out of here, no one can stop us from taking it on together. Come with me, please.",
        "Mallet: So, what do you think?",
        "Dinah: I need a massage. I need a massage, and I'm going to go get it, okay. I'm going to go get my suitcase. I love you. I love you.",
