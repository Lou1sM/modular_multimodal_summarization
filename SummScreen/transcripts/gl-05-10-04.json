{"Episode Summary": [], "Recap": ["Harley catches Gus at the mall in his undercover disguise, after which she grills him on the why and what of his unusual attire. After he dances around a bit, she lets the matter go and enlists his help in checking on Eden and Bill. Phillip continues his reign of creepiness on Olivia in their bedroom while downstairs, Lizzie is telling Alan, Alex and Beth that Phillip is back. Alan is party bound, wanting to celebrate the return of the prince. Phillip and Olivia eventually cease their verbal dancing and go downstairs to meet and greet the family. Two toasts later, everyone splits off into groups and begins plotting their strategy regarding Phillips return to the fold. Alex wonders if he's ready while Alan says not to worry. Olivia has conversations with everyone but Beth in hopes of turning them against Phillip - to no avail. She resorts to torturing Alex instead before following Phillip to bed. Upstairs, Phillip puts more pressure on Olivia to see if she'll crack but she throws him off with a few choice words. He tells her he feels he should take things slow and sleep in the guestroom but once outside the door, he becomes outraged. Later that evening, he creeps back into her room to watch her sleep but she wakes up and freaks out. He leaves and she bolts the door. And.... after most everyone goes to bed, Beth tells Alan that she's considering moving out of the house. He talks her out of it.", "Meanwhile - at Danny and Michelle's house, Salerno visits, brings an unreasonably big ugly vase as a gift and doubts Michelle's sincerity when she invites him to dinner and encourages him to bring a guest. Michelle finally tugs on the right strings and Salerno leaves with Danny, somewhat convinced she's on her way to accepting life as a mob wife. Danny and Michelle share a tortured kiss and he runs off with Salerno. Later in the day, Tammy pays a visit to Michelle and asks for the keys to the family cabin for her and her friends to hang out. Michelle is under the impression that Cassie approves so she hands over the keys. When next we see Danny, he's at the club with Tony, Salerno and two henchman. Salerno drops a hint that something is going down on the weekend but won't say what. After Salerno goes to check the place for bugs.. Danny expresses to Tony that Salerno doesn't trust him... to which Tony replies, \"Neither do I.\" After a bit of sleuthing later on... Danny may have a clue to the weekend doings. At Towers, Eden and Bill are kissing on each other and Eden says she wants the big wedding after all. Bill goes to make the arrangements for the use of the club and also to meet with Gus. Once he's out of earshot...Eden leaves a message on Salerno's phone saying that she'll do one more job and then she's out. Harley shows up with her coconuts (the tropical theme for the shower) and Eden lets her know that the wedding is definitely back on. During their conversation Harley worms the truth out of Eden about her relationship with Salerno by showing her the discarded note from the Beacon. Eden says that Salerno's not going to be a problem.. Harley warns her that may not be true. At the mall, Bill meets with Gus for the \"she's my sister\" talk. At Towers, Salerno calls Eden with her new assignment. She refuses but he says that if she does just this one last thing, she's out so she agrees."], "Recap Author": "Silver Eagle Dreamer", "Show Title": "Guiding Light", "Transcript": ["Gus: Ah, sexy mama.

Dad's home. Uncle Rick said he was okay, and he let him go from Ravenswood.", "Beth: Oh, my word.", "Lizzie: Well, wasn't that worth rushing home for?", "Alan: Well, of course it was, sweetheart. I think this moment calls for a celebration, huh?", "Lizzie: Yeah. Then tomorrow we can finally start getting back to normal.", "Beth: Well, one day at a time, sweetie. It's going to take your dad a chance to settle back in.", "Alexandra: Lizzie, last time I saw him he was still quite out of it. Are you sure he's his old self again?", "Lizzie: Maybe even better.", "Alan: Well, that's great. Well, let's get the celebration started.

Are you wondering if I'm still crazy or just how far am I willing to go?", "Olivia: Okay, Phillip. You want to act crazy? Bring it on. There was a time when I thought you'd never want to touch me again, after everything I did to you.", "Phillip: Like I said, just water under the bridge.", "Olivia: But I lied to you about losing our baby. I mean, all those days and weeks of your life that you'll never get back again. When I came back to town, I took over your place at the company, I moved into your home. I wouldn't let your family visit you. After all that, you're willing to move past this? After everything I did, you still want me?

You've got to eat, right? And feel free to bring a guest.", "Salerno: Well, this is a surprise.", "Danny: Is it?", "Salerno: I always got the feeling you never really liked me, you know? Maybe you heard some rumors, read things in the papers.", "Michelle: I don't really buy into rumors, and I've read a lot of lies about my own family, so I don't believe everything I read.", "Salerno: I should tell you that Danny has offered to get me settled into Springfield.

All right. That's what I like to hear. So you're back on board?", "Eden: Yes, thanks to Mel and Rick Bauer. They helped me realize how much a real wedding means. And yes, I will marry you.", "Bill: You know, you make me very happy.", "Eden: And you make me very happy.", "Bill: All right. This is what I'm going to do. I'm going to call the country club to let them know that the wedding is still on, okay? I love this wedding stuff. Does that make me a little weird?

I'm trying to figure out how delirium's getting out onto the streets.", "Harley: Frank moved you to vice and you didn't tell me? Don't tell me that you're doing this without a partner.", "Gus: Well, you know how it goes sometimes, right? But don't worry, don't worry. It's official now, because he pushed the paperwork, pushed it through for me. So...", "Harley: Let me guess what took place. You did something without following department procedure, and yet Frank still miraculously moves you to vice, which is where you want to be anyway?", "Gus: No, no, no. I didn't say that. I practically had to get myself arrested first.", "Harley: I knew it was something like that.", "Gus: Well, I'm trying to do my job, okay?", "Harley: This is not about you doing your job. This is about you trying to figure out how delirium gets from Spaulding to the mob to the street, which is why you're working the street. This is about you trying to clear Alan.", "Gus: All right, so a little piece of it has to do with Alan. All right, a big chunk of it. All right, the whole thing, okay? The whole thing is because of Alan. But I'll tell you this-- he's got nothing to do with how the mob is getting their drugs. I can't... I think it's Brad Green, except I can't make the connection between brad green and Salerno. I can't...", "Harley: What does that have to do with you and Brad Green in Paris? His wife seems to think you two had a thing.", "Eden: Vinnie, he would have killed both of us if we had. But that didn't stop Brad from hitting on me.", "Gus: Are you listening? So I think that I'm making some progress, you know? I think I'm getting some information to help clear my father. Can we get out of the mall, and can we go home, please? I'm offering now, huh?", "Harley: No. I can't go home. I have to go meet your sister. Shower stuff.", "Gus: Coconuts?", "Harley: I'll tell you later.", "Gus: I didn't even know the mall sold coconuts.", "Harley: Well, now you know. Listen, I want... I want this shower to be special for Eden. I want it to be great, because she seems really, really worried. Does bill seem worried to you?", "Gus: I don't know. What, you want me to look in on the groom, you take care of the bride?", "Harley: Yeah. I just want to make sure that my groom can meet me later at towers. Is that cool? Could you change your clothes, ice-g?", "Gus: You don't know what you're talking about.", "Harley: Mm-hmm. \u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: Welcome home, son.", "Phillip: It's good to be home.", "Alexandra: Phillip, Phillip, you look wonderful, darling. You look better than you've looked in a long time.", "Beth: We missed you around here.", "Phillip: Not nearly as much as I missed being here. I can promise you that. And I can't tell you how ready I am to jump back into everything.", "Alan: Good.", "Phillip: I had Evie schedule a board meeting for the end of the week, because I want everyone at Spaulding to know that I'm back and ready to go, which reminds me...", "Olivia: Phillip, don't you think it's a little too soon just to jump back into work? Maybe you should just ease into it, you know? Get used to being home.", "Phillip: Look at you. I'm back and I'm all better, and you're still looking out for me.", "Lizzie: I'm looking out for your social calendar. Okay. So I had this idea that maybe you and mom and I could hang out this weekend-- you know, make it a real family affair. And Zach and James and Emma can come, too.", "Phillip: That sounds great.", "Alan: I want to make a toast to my son Phillip, to his good health and long- awaited return home. May he never leave home again. Hear, hear.", "Phillip: And I would like to make a toast to my family, and especially to my wife Olivia, for the daughter that she has given me, which makes everything worthwhile. Here's to all of us being under one roof again.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Did you get anything on the Brad Green phone list I gave you? Well, help me out a little here, O'Neill. I'm meeting green tomorrow. Good. Yes, I'm still working the Eden angle. I'll tell you, I hope I come up empty, because I hate the thought of her being involved in this drug business in any way, especially now. Well, I'll do what I'm going to do.

How are you?", "Harley: Hi, bill. I mean, chick stuff. You know, you don't want to be around.", "Bill: Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. Of course. Okay. I'll catch you later, all right?

Bye.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eden: I almost canceled on you today.", "Harley: You did? No shower?", "Eden: No wedding.", "Harley: What? You and bill are...", "Eden: No, we're good. We're better than good. I was just thinking the whole big wedding wasn't the way to go. No worries, I am back on board, and... just a temporary case of wedding jitters.", "Harley: Right. You sure that's all it was?", "Eden: Mm-hmm.", "Harley: Okay. Because we have a party to plan. See? And look-- I already sorted your guest list.", "Eden: Darcy, and all of bill's friends.", "Harley: Well, bill's friends are your friends, right?", "Eden: Harley, please. They were just hoping I was a phase. You know, it's pathetic. I have no friends.", "Harley: That's not true. You have Marah.", "Eden: Overseas.", "Harley: You have Danny and Michelle.", "Eden: Co-ed bridal?", "Harley: Well, we won't call it a bridal shower. We'll call it an engagement party. Come on. At this point I don't think we're in a position to rule anybody out.", "Eden: Bill and Danny, they're on the outs. They had a big blowup after the campaign scandal.", "Harley: Yeah. Well, I talked to Michelle, and I'll tell you, she really believes that Danny did nothing wrong.", "Eden: Yeah, but bill believes he did.", "Harley: Bill really thinks that Danny rigged that vote?", "Eden: Yeah. That and that he didn't cut his ties to the mob.", "Harley: Yeah. That's a whole world that it's tough to get out of. Your case, for example.", "Eden: Harley, we've gone over this.", "Harley: Yeah, and we didn't get very far. Come on. Tell me the truth.

Really, Michelle's just inviting you over for dinner sometime.", "Michelle: No, it's okay, Danny. I completely understand why he'd question it. I'm not from your world, and I've tried many times to bring you into mine. Obviously didn't work.", "Salerno: So, if you can't beat them, join them.", "Michelle: Bottom line, I love my life. I love my house. I love the fact that my son is going to go to all the best schools. And I love my husband and the security that he provides us. And it's all a product of your world. I'm not thrilled about it, no. But I also realize at the end of the day I love what I have. You can't always get it where you want it.", "Salerno: Women, huh? They know where their bread is buttered. Come on, Danny. We've got places to be.", "Danny: Oh, you... okay, sure. Can you just give me a minute to get my stuff together?", "Salerno: Yeah, I'll meet you in the car.", "Danny: All right.", "Salerno: Make it quick.", "Danny: Sure. Hey, you okay? Huh?", "Michelle: Yeah.", "Danny: This is just the beginning. He's going to be in our house again. He's going to be in our life until this is over. It all starts now.", "Michelle: Okay.

Well, it's great having Phillip hope, isn't it?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: It is. And I think home is where he should stay. Look I know he's eager to get back to work and pick up where he left off at Spaulding, but I hope you'll support me in keeping him away from the office right now.", "Alan: Well, I think that decision should be left up to Phillip. I mean, he looks fine.", "Olivia: Yes, he looks fine, but who knows how fine he really is? And I've been doing a good job of keeping his seat warm.", "Alan: You know, you're going to have to give up that suite one of these days, Olivia.", "Olivia: Before or after the feds tear your company apart, Alan? I have been able to keep the press from ripping us to shreds while this investigation is going on. I am the face of squeaky clean Spaulding enterprises, and you know it.", "Alan: Yes, I suppose I do. \u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Beth: So, a bit of a full house around here.", "Lizzie: Yeah. Maybe grandpa can get Olivia her own wing so she can leave the rest of us alone.", "Beth: Actually, honey, we may need to be the ones to get out of her way.", "Lizzie: What do you mean?", "Beth: Well, I just thought since your dad is home that maybe you and James and I would be better off getting a place of our own.", "Lizzie: How would that be better?", "Beth: Honey, you can't be comfortable living with Olivia.", "Lizzie: Mom, I don't care as long as dad's here.", "Beth: Okay. I just want you to think about it. It would make the transition easier for everyone, especially for your dad.", "Lizzie: Well, no one's trying to make this whole transition easier for me. \u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alexandra: Oh, darling, I'll tell you, it is so good to have you back home again. And it must be wonderful to be able to think straight, huh?", "Phillip: Yes, it is.", "Alexandra: Well, now you can take back control of your life.", "Phillip: Why is it I have a feeling you have some suggestions about how I should do that?", "Alexandra: Oh, well... oh, maybe just one or two. For instance, you could dump Olivia.", "Phillip: I appreciate your concern. I really do. But don't worry. I have Olivia exactly where I want her.", "Phillip: Well, I think I've had enough excitement for one day. I'm going to call it a night.", "Alexandra: Oh, good-night, darling.", "Phillip: Good night. Coming, sweetheart?", "Olivia: I'll be up in a minute.", "Phillip: Okay. Don't be long.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alexandra: Well, aren't you going up with your husband?", "Olivia: Soon.", "Alexandra: Oh, well, don't worry. I'm sure it'll come back to you like riding a bike.", "Olivia: Always the class act.", "Alexandra: Of course, it's really none of my business what goes on behind closed bedroom doors. I just want my family to be happy.", "Olivia: I'm happy.", "Alexandra: Happy now, or when you had Phillip under your thumb at Ravenswood?
