        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Sandy: Already legally subdivided.",

        "Gus: Yo, what's up, lifer? Let me explain how this is going to work, big al. I'm going to keep you in here until you tell me every single guard that you have paid off at the prison, okay? And then I'm going to show you some of my more interesting techniques that I learned when i was down at the bureau. Son of a gun.",
        "Harley: They want to transfer me to hellis correctional?",
        "Mallet: Yeah.",
        "Harley: That's the worst of the worst. There has to be a mistake. There has to be.",
        "Mallet: It's not a mistake. That's it right there.",
        "Harley: They call that place hell house. It is the drop-off for the unredeemable, and I'm not just talking about the prisoners.",

I haven't seen her since morning. You know what? Maybe that's a good thing. Okay. But, you know, this isn't summer camp. I just can'T... all right. Okay. I said okay. I'll try and find out what's going on, all right? All right. Go ahead, alan. Make my day.",
        "Harley: What am I looking at? When is the transfer?",
        "Mallet: Never. Never. Listen to me: Orders get lost all the time; so do prisoners.",
        "Harley: Prisoners get lost?",
        "Mallet: I'm going to hide you in here. Now, I told them they made a clerical error, that you're already gone, but we have to keep you out of circulation, mplelylateunl can haansfer",

        "Mallet: No. No, no one. Except me.",
        "Tammy: Do you need some help, jonathan?",
        "Jonathan: If there was another way, I wouldn't even ask you.",
        "Tammy: Chill out, it's fine. You saved me from that fire, so I owe you. And I don't like owing you, so let me just help you and we can call it even, okay? So, what are you working on? Sit. Show me.",
        "Jonathan: You'd sit at a table alone with me?",
        "Tammy: I'm not scared of you.",
        "Jonathan: All right. This is what I'm working on, or supposed to be working on.",
        "Tammy: \"Basic blueprint.\"",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, well, the construction starts with the blueprint, right, and then you estimate a cost, work up a bid. But, I mean, it'S... see? This?",
        "Tammy: It looks like a description of what the client wants.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I know. It's the construction project lead. But it's these... I don't know, the print is too small and the letters get almixed up in my head. It's like the \"p's\" look like \"b's\" or \"d'S.\"",
        "Tammy: Oh. You mean you are...",
        "Jonathan: Whatever. I'm looking for help, not a diagnosis.",
        "Tammy: No, no. Millions of people have it, jonathan. It's not like you're in bad company.",

        "Nate: What's a bloke got to do to make it a special occasion?",
        "Reva: Well, most times he marries me.",
        "Nate: I'll pass.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) so, you're the bartender here.",
        "Nate: I wonder what gave me away.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs )",
        "Nate: Actually, I own this bar.",
        "Reva: I have always wanted to do that.",
        "Nate: Well, you came to the right place. Step right up. Get yourself a free lesson. One night.",
        "Reva: Wow.",
        "Nate: One night only.",
        "Reva: Cheers. You've got to roll with it you've got to take your time you've got to say what you say don't let anybody get in your way 'cause it's all too much for me to take don't ever stand aside don't ever be denied you ought to be who you be if you're coming with me...",
        "Reva: Please don't make me. I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside I think I'm gonna take me away and hide I'm thinking things that i just can't abide I know the roads on which your life will drive...",
        "Reva: ( Screams ) I find the key that lets you slip inside... ( laughter ) Kiss the girl she's not behind the door did you know I think i recognize your face but I've never seen you before you've got to roll with it...",
        "Reva: Easy. You've got to take your time you've got to say what you say don't let anybody get in your way 'cause it's all too much for me to take...",

        "Harley: What about my dad? He's got a bad heart. And my kids. I can'T... I can't just disappear, mallet.",
        "Mallet: Harley, you can't go to that place. Chances are you'll never come out alive. ( Intercom buzzes ) yeah, what now?",
        "Guard: Mr. Keys from the department of corrections is here.",
        "Mallet: Uh. Uh, hold him for five and then send him up.",
        "Guard: Sorry, warden. He's already on his way, sir.",
        "Mallet: That's your transfer. You've got to get out of here. Come on, let's go. Get out of here. Harley, what are you doing? You have to go. Harley, listen. Are you listening to me?",
        "Harley: Did you ever lose something that was staring you right in the face?",
        "Mallet: Oh, no. You're coming up with one of your schemes, aren't you? Harley, this is not the time. Don't go off on some irrational tangent, here.",
        "Harley: Come on. We haven't been divorced that long. Stay with me, here.",
        "Mallet: Oh, gosh.",
        "Harley: Perfect. When did you$start wearing glasses?",
        "Mallet: They're just for reading. ( Knock at door ) one second.",
        "Harley: Go ahead, answer the door.",
        "Mallet: Go hide on the balcony.",
        "Harley: Open the door, mallet.",
        "Mallet: Get in the closet.",
        "Harley: Open the door. ( Knock at door )",
        "Mallet: Yeah, one second. I've got a bad feeling about this. Mr. Key. Good to see you again. How are you, sir?",
        "Mr. Key: I'm running late. Where's the prisoner?",
        "Mallet: Oh, I've... sorry, i should introduce you to...",
        "Harley: Gail seton.",
        "Mallet: Gail seton.",
        "Harley: Yeah. Feature reporter, \"times- gazette.\"",
        "Mallet: \"Times-gazette.\"",
        "Harley: Uh-huh. You couldn't have come at a better time, mr. Key. This warden and his prison are a complete and utter disaster.",
        "Olivia: Let's try this again, gus. Give up the investigation.",
        "Gus: Or what's going to happen to me? Can you be a little more specific?",
        "Olivia: You know, maybe you haven't had enough time to think about our conversations.",
        "Gus: Hm. I think I've had all the time in the world, don't you?",
        "Olivia: ( Gasps )",
        "Gus: That's funny, because i thought that was alan walking down the hallway, but then i realized he hasn't worn heels since the '70s. And now I know it's you. You locked me in there and you who was threatening harley. Well, I think it's a whole new world now, don't you?",
        "Reva: Gin and tonic, tom collins, screwdriver.",
        "Nate: In under 60 seconds. You're a natural.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) I'm not saying that I'm a professional bartender, but I do have experience around alcohol.",
        "Nate: All right, let's go again. Tandem.",
        "Reva: Okay. ( Laughs ) this is so much fun! It almost makes me want to forget about... oh. Wow. My demographically correct producer, the one who fired me, is here. She's the one that told me I was too old and too out of touch to host my own show. And I know that I should do the adult thing and just kind of forget about it...",
        "Nate: You're not going to, are you?",
        "Reva: No way in hell.",
        "Tammy: The project calls for the construction of 25 2,200 square foot buildings with kitchen and living area, and if the plumbing and electricity cost $60,000 on 3,000 square feet...",
        "Jonathan: That's $44,000 for 2,200 square feet.",
        "Tammy: How did you do that?",
        "Jonathan: It's easy when i hear it out loud. You're surprised, huh?",
        "Tammy: No, I'm not. I always knew you were smart. You just act stupid most of the time.",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) thank you for the clarification.",
        "Tammy: But you know, this problem that you have, letters getting mixed up, that can be dealt with. Learning disabilities are...",
        "Jonathan: I'm not disabled. Don't call me that. I'm tired.",
        "Tammy: But you didn't finish your bids yet.",
        "Jonathan: Screw the bids. I don't even care about this lewis construction crap.",
        "Tammy: You should. It's your family's business.",
        "Jonathan: No. Correction: Joshua is not my family.",
        "Tammy: Well, reva's your mother. Josh and billy's dad, H.B. Lewis, left his are of the company to her.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, that's a nice gift for the housekeeper's daughter.",
        "Tammy: She was his wife once, too, you know?",
        "Jonathan: Right. It's hard to keep track.",
        "Tammy: You would have liked H.B. He was a rule-breaker, a hell- raiser, just like you. He started lewis oil on a nickel and a handshake. He was one of those wild... whatever you call them.",
        "Jonathan: Wildcatter?",
        "Tammy: That's it. All the lewis and shayne men were pretty colorful guys. They made their marks on the world in their own little ways. They may have made mistakes along the way but they weren't quitters.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, well, I'm part prince. I'm entitled to certain things.",
        "Tammy: You're part shayne, too. And richard wasn't a quitter, either.",
        "Jonathan: All right. All right. Well, maybe if I act and think like a lewis it'll help. ( Drawls ): You all want to talk turkey on some drywall and paint? Reva, darling, can you get me my liniment?",
        "Tammy: ( Laughs )",
        "Jonathan: Oh, no, it's in the corn whiskey bottle. Now, don't give me no gruff, because the doctor prescribed it. ( Laughs )",
        "Harley: I wouldn't board my cat here. The food is inedible, the guards are unsupervised and security is a joke. Give me a break.",
        "Mr. Key: All right, I'll look into all of it. Warden? About this prisoner we're transferring to hellis? Cooper. Harley cooper.",
        "Mallet: Uh, right, right. That's the one we talked about on the phone. She was transferred out earlier this morning and she's someone else's problem now, and i couldn't be happier.",
        "Mr. Key: I have the transfer order right here.",
        "Mallet: Uh, right. Well, that's a clerical error.",
        "Harley: Wait a minute, wait a minute. You lost a prisoner?",
        "Mallet: No, we didn't lose a prisoner.",
        "Harley: That is unbelievable. Mr. Key, would you give me that name again?",
        "Mallet: Uh, don't give that crazy reporter any more ammunition. Look, I'm going to look into it personally. I'll call you back.",
        "Mr. Key: It was very nice to meet you, ms. Seton. I'll be in touch.",
        "Mallet: Absolutely. ( Chuckles ) cooper, man, you still have it, don't you?",
        "Harley: Don't pat my back just yet. This is serious business. If somebody catches on to whet we're doing here, I'm going to hell house and you're going straight to maximum security.",
        "Mallet: Don't worry about me.",
        "Harley: It's a little hard to do, since you're risking everything for me, mallet.",
        "Mallet: I'll be fine.",
        "Harley: Why are you doing this? Why are you risking everything for me? We haven't seen each other in ten years. And don't give me that crap about you cheated on me so you owe me. I don't think that's what's going on. We're not married anymore. We don't have any kids together. You could lose everything for me.",
        "Mallet: We're wasting time, harley. Let's get down to logistics.",
        "Harley: How long do you really think you can hide me here?",
        "Mallet: As long as it takes.",
        "Olivia: I could lie. I could pretend that this was all a misunderstanding.",
        "Gus: Yeah, but that would be insulting my intelligence.",
        "Olivia: I did it. I locked you in that room.",
        "Gus: Why?",
        "Olivia: Because I was scared. Alan wants revenge against phillip's murderer, and not just against harley. He said that if harley walked, i would take her place. And then you moved into the house and you started grilling me, and I panicked. I just needed to find some way to shut you down before you...",
        "Gus: Before I what? Found evidence that linked you to the murder?",
        "Olivia: This isn't about evidence. You don't care. You care about harley. You're desperate. You would sell out your own mother if it meant she got out of prison. I had to find some way to get you off my back.",
        "Gus: You were going to make me disappear.",
        "Olivia: Not forever. Just long enough... just long enough for me to make things right with bill, because i couldn't bear the thought of going against both you and alan by myself.",
        "Gus: Well, I got to respect that.",
        "Olivia: You believe me?",
        "Gus: Well, I don't know if it'S... I'm just in a good mood or if I'm intoxicated or not, because... do you smell... what is that?",
        "Olivia: My perfume?",
        "Gus: Yeah. Yeah, because when I was in the little room, I was smelling, like, what I thought was a garden or something. Is that...",
        "Olivia: It's jasmine. Coming up on \"guiding light.\"",
        "Mallet: You're going to be safe. No one's going to find you. Just put yourself in my hands and relax.",
        "Harley: I just don't know if I can do that.",
        "Gus: You had plenty of time to kill phillip. You shot him. Just say it.",
        "Olivia: No. Stop.",
        "Gus: Oh, just say it! Just say it!",
        "Olivia: Stop it!",
        "Mallet: We have to keep you hidden for a few days until i can get that transfer order withdrawn. It may take a few days, it could take longer. And no one can see you, not even my own administration.",
        "Harley: There has to be somebody you trust.",
        "Mallet: No. No one. We trust no one.",
        "Harley: So, what do we do now? We just sit here?",
        "Mallet: Maybe get some sleep. This is a pretty comfy couch. I've got some... hey, a pillow.",
        "Harley: You don't have to do that, really.",
        "Mallet: I've got a blanket. I'll make you a bed.",
        "Harley: I did always love the way you made a bed.",
        "Mallet: Really?",
        "Harley: Because you'd tuck in the corners so tight, you know? And then when I'd crawl in, it would be like I was in a cocoon, you know? It felt so warm and safe.",
        "Mallet: Well, I'm not making any promises this time, but I'll do my best.",
        "Harley: ( Laughs )",
        "Mallet: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. You come here. Inside. Inside, now. How much did you hear? ( Clears throat ) you've been in this prison for a while, haven't you?",
        "Lena: Oh, uh... a while.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, that's a problem. I mean, not for me, but for you. You see, for me, it's fairly simple. I just pick up the phone and you spend a nice chunk of time in solitary.",
        "Harley: No, no, no, no, no.",
        "Mallet: It's because...",
        "Harley: Wait, wait. Before you make that call, can i just talk to her for a minute?",
        "Mallet: No.",
        "Harley: Please?",
        "Lena: This is a pretty cozy little setup, huh?",
        "Harley: Lena, here's the story. Lena, are you listening to me?",
        "Lena: Yes.",
        "Harley: They want to transfer me. To hellis correctional.",
        "Lena: Oh, that'S... that's not good at all.",
        "Harley: No. You know they call it hell house, right? Yeah. And I don't know why they want to do this, but I do know that an ex-cop like me wouldn't do real good in that place. Do you understand?",
        "Lena: \"Tomorrow is another day.\" \"Gone with the wind,\" 1939.",
        "Harley: Listen, lena, remember how scared I was when i got here. I don't know what I expected. I certainly didn't expect... him. And I didn't expect you. You have actually made this place bearable for me, you know? You kind of take care of me a little bit, and if you knew me better, you'd know how hard it is for me to let somebody take care of me. Ou'vbe rllfor me, too. And I haven't been much of a caretaker in my life. You could just ask my daughter that.",
        "Harley: You know what? My own mom had her mothering issues, too, and I loved her anyway. I did. Lena, listen. What you heard? I know that you could take that information and you could call somebody and you could maybe get some time off your sentence, and I would understand...",
        "Lena: No.",
        "Harley: ...If you did that. I would understand if you chose to save yourself. All I can ask is just please think about it before you make that decision.",
        "Olivia: Why the sudden interest in my perfume?",
        "Gus: I just noticed it, is all.",
        "Olivia: It's just that you're the second person who's asked me about it.",
        "Gus: Well, when I was in my little hotel room here, I kept smelling, you know, flowers. I thought I was hallucinating.",
        "Olivia: So you know I'm the one who locked you up in there. What are you going to do?",
        "Gus: Why do you think that alan would frame you for phillip's murder?",
        "Olivia: I'm not saying that he is, I'm just saying that he could.",
        "Gus: Yeah, well I'm saying, what would he gain from it? Everybody knows you got to company after phillip was shot, right?",
        "Olivia: No... yes.",
        "Gus: Right.",
        "Olivia: Right.",
        "Gus: So what's the... I don't get it, what's the problem?",
        "Olivia: I just know alan. Come on. He has a way of making things happen.",
        "Gus: Mm-hmm. That sounds like paranoia to me.",
        "Olivia: It's not paranoia when people are really out to get you.",
        "Gus: Unless, of course, you've got something to hide. I'll ask you one more time: What time did you get down to company, olivia? You got down there before everybody else, didn't you? Before everybody else, so you had plenty of time to kill phillip. You shot him. Just say it.",
        "Olivia: No. Stop.",
        "Gus: Oh, just say it! Just say it!",
        "Olivia: Stop it!",
        "Bill: Hey! What the hell is going on?",
        "Tammy: Hi.",
        "Sandy: Hi. Mm.",
        "Tammy: I was helping jonathan study.",
        "Sandy: Well, there's something new.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. It's lewis construction stuff. I want to impress myoss and earn my paycheck.",
        "Sandy: Next time you want to talk business, call me. I'll help you out.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, look, tammy. The gods have smiled on me. Sandy's going to be my tutor.",
        "Tammy: I think we've done enough for today.",
        "Jonathan: Well, thank you for sticking it out with me.",
        "Tammy: No problem. I owe you.",
        "Sandy: You owe him?",
        "Tammy: I can explain.",
        "Sandy: No, no need. We spend... waste too much time talking about jonathan.",
        "Tammy: This is nice. I wasn't expecting to see you tonight.",
        "Sandy: Well, I had a meeting with bill and he had to take off. I thought I'd pick up some food, take it to your place. I come in here and...",
        "Tammy: Here I am.",
        "Sandy: What more could a guy ask for?",
        "Reva: Be a doll and deliver this to her. Flash your best smile, give her a wink, because girls like that are suckers for accents.",
        "Nate: I hope you're not handing my number. She's not my type.",
        "Reva: Just deliver the message. You'll be fine. ( Laughs )",
        "Stephanie: Hi.",
        "Nate: This is for you. \"You'll be fine.\"",
        "Reva: ( Laughs )",
        "Nate: Fine? I almost drowned out there.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) it was for a good cause, right?",
        "Nate: I think I deserve to know the contents of that note.",
        "Reva: \"Hey there, baby. You're looking so fine and sexy. Why don't you drop the broads and we can go out for some little adult fun?\" ( Laughs )",
        "Nate: You're so cruel, reva shayne. ( Laughs )",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, she deserved it. And you know something? Mm. You make a very good cosmo. ( Laughs )",
        "Nate: I'd hate to get on your bad side.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, you know, back in the day I went through one or two stephanies a week if they got in my way.",
        "Nate: In the way of what?",
        "Reva: Of what I wanted. You know: Joshua, money, respect. I pretty much wanted it all back then.",
        "Nate: And now?",
        "Reva: I pretty much have it all. Except the job.",
        "Nate: Forget the job. Take off the gloves, stop fighting. Your life is set.",
        "Reva: Yeah. My life is set.",
        "Nate: And that's not working for you.",
        "Reva: Well, yes and no.",
        "Nate: It's kind of hard to break yourself from raising hell, isn't it? It's like kicking smokes. That old urge keeps coming back when you least expect it.",
        "Reva: How did you know I was a troublemaker?",
        "Nate: Was? I imagine you still are.",
        "Reva: Well, my husband and my sister would have to agree with you on that, because I have been at it lately. But I'm ready to kick that habit, kick all that and give it all up and just behave myself.",
        "Nate: If you say so.",
        "Reva: I say so.",
        "Tammy: What's this?",
        "Sandy: Open it. You'll see.",
        "Tammy: A present.",
        "Sandy: I looked at the calendar and I saw that it's been six months.",
        "Tammy: For us, really?",
        "Sandy: Mm-hmm. Six months ago today, I found you at the docks, desperate because of what jonathan did to you.",
        "Tammy: That was my low point. But you pulled me up from it.",
        "Sandy: No. You picked yourself up, and from that moment, you've been climbing step by step, getting your life together.",
        "Tammy: I couldn't have done it without you.",
        "Sandy: You would have done it anyway.",
        "Tammy: A ladder.",
        "Sandy: So you can keep going up.",
        "Tammy: Sandy.",
        "Sandy: You're amazing, tammy. You really are. Okay, uh, let's go. Your place, my place, I don't care.",
        "Tammy: I, um... I'm sorry, I can'T. I'm sorry.",
        "Sandy: It's okay, i understand.",
        "Tammy: Can this happen, but later?",
        "Sandy: Of course. Okay, go. Go. I'll call you.",
        "Tammy: Sandy, thank you. For helping me climb the ladder.",
        "Gus: I don't think you want to know what's going on here?",
        "Bill: No, I know what's going on, gus. You've been on a roller coaster since harley was accused of phillip's murder. You're lashing out at anyone and everyone, and I'll tell you, it's going to stop with my wife. All right? I am sick of the pain that you've been putting her through. I've had it.",
        "Olivia: I'll always love you.",
        "Gus: Can I talk to you for a minute?",
        "Bill: No, anything you've got to say to me, you say it right here in front of my wife.",
        "Gus: No, just for a second.",
        "Bill: No, no. You say it right here.",
        "Gus: Just come this way, will you? Take a look at this room, bill. What do you think?",
        "Bill: I think it could use a little paint. Maybe do something fancy with the pipes here. What do you want, gus?",
        "Gus: Your wife locked me in here for days on end and she left me in here to rot.",
        "Bill: Why would olivia lock you up?",
        "Gus: Well, bill, because she wanted me to stop my investigation. See, I was getting too close to the truth, asking too many questions. And then to top it off, she threatened harley. And I managed to get out of here, bill, and I went down to the prison, and guess what? Harley got roughed up by a bunch of prison guards and she ended up with a concussion.",
        "Bill: So you think olivia had something to do with that? Why?",
        "Gus: Because I think your wife over there killed phillip.",
        "Lena: You're such a nice kid, harley. And you deserve a lot better than this.",
        "Harley: Oh.",
        "Lena: You do.",
        "Harley: Lena, you too.",
        "Lena: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. ( Laughs ) hey, hey. \"Here's looking at you, kid.\" Bogart, 1942.",
        "Harley: \"Casablanca.\"",
        "Lena: \"Casablanca.\" ( Laughs )",
        "Harley: See? See? I knew that one.",
        "Mallet: Yeah?",
        "Harley: You know what? I think she's going to keep quiet. I do. We have this connection. ( Laughs ) she reminds me of my mom. You know, because she's got all this movie trivia stuff and she calls me \"honey,\" like my mom did.",
        "Mallet: Poor nadine. I'm so sorry that you weren't here when... I mean, if I hadn't taken you to the florida, maybe you could have stopped it somehow. Maybe your mother would still be...",
        "Harley: Hey, you know what? We talked about this. Maybe she wouldn't be.",
        "Mallet: Yeah. But hey, you're the one we have to worry about now, okay? You're going to be safe. No one's going to find you. Just put yourself in my hands and relax.",
        "Harley: I just don't know if I can do that.",
        "Mallet: Is there another choice?",
        "Harley: I guess not. You know, you never answered my question. Why are you doing this?",
        "Mallet: Um, hey, everybody's got to have a hobby.",
        "Bill: Okay, so now you think olivia murdered phillip.",
        "Gus: Mm-hmm. Well, there's proof, bill.",
        "Bill: Proof?",
        "Gus: Yeah. Harley smelled jasmine down at company.",
        "Bill: Jasmine. ( Laughs )",
        "Gus: Jasmine.",
        "Bill: My goodness, gus.",
        "Gus: Olivia's favorite perfume. Now, a lot of people wear jasmine, I'm sure they do, but not necessarily the same people that locked me in this room to try to keep me from the truth.",
        "Nate: Wow. What a showoff.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) yeah, well, you know. This is so much fun I do it for free.",
        "Nate: Good, because I'm not sharing my tips.",
        "Reva: Your tips? I seem to remember a certain salesman giving me a very big, fat tip that...",
        "Nate: What is it?",
        "Reva: Well, I... never mind. I just thought... doesn't matter. Cheers.",
        "Jonathan: I hope you're not all freaked out about the stuff between me and tammy.",
        "Jonathan: I hope you're not all freaked out about the stuff between me and tammy.",
        "Sandy: You and tammy?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Yeah, we're getting along really good lately, and she's promised to help me with a few things, so we're probably going to be spending a lot of time together. Alone. If tammy were my girl, i wouldn't want her spending time alone with a guy like me.",
        "Sandy: Tammy's not yours. She never will be. And we're doing great together.",
        "Jonathan: We'll see about that.",
        "Bill: Olivia's not the one who killed phillip.",
        "Gus: Why did she get so upset at the trial? Why did she take pictures of my witness, jack webster?",
        "Bill: I don't know, gus.",
        "Gus: Why is she getting herself so involved?",
        "Bill: Gus, I don't know.",
        "Gus: What if this: What if she is a murderer. How are you going to sleep at night knowing you're lying down next to a cold-blooded killer? Hm?",
        "Bill: Olivia? Olivia! Hey!",
        "Olivia: It's way too hot in this little town. We should have left after... but you know what? We have a chance to leave right now, and I know you're going to miss bill because I am, too, but we have to go. Okay, baby? We have to say good-bye to springfield. So let's do that right now. Okay? All right, sweetie? Give me your hand. Let's go.",
        "Harley: You're asking too much. I'sorry, okay, but how do i trust you? You broke my heart. You destroyed my dreams. You took years off my life. I mean, you know how long it took me to get over you? You know how long it took for me to trust anybody after you?",
        "Mallet: Harley, just one thing at a time, okay? Slow down. Right now, we have to focus on the fact that you cannot go to hellis correctional. What about your kids? What about your father and frank? If I let you leave here, they may never, ever get you back. Take a chance on me.",
        "Lena: Alan, it's me. You have to bring me my daughter. Listen to me. You have to bring me my daughter this week. This week or I'm not going to do this. You promise? You promise if I do that, you'll bring her to me? Cross your heart? Harley's with the warden. He's hiding her so she doesn't get transferred. ( Sobs )",
        "Mallet: You're safe with me. You're safe.",
        "Tammy: Next, on \"guiding light.\"",
        "Gus: Bill, wake up.",
        "Bill: No, you wake up, gus. She's home, which is exactly where I'm going.",
        "Gus: Not yet.",
        "Harley: Do you have any idea what you're getting yourself into. You do this, we're going to be cell mates.",
