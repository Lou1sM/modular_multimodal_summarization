        "Coop, Reva, Cassie and Harley - In the Light \u0096 Happy Mother's Day",
        "Buzz, thinking of and missing Jenna, throws a 23rd annual Mother's Day picnic celebration on Main Street. Suddenly, many get sick, including Cassie, Harley, Buzz, and Lizzie. They go to Cedars Hospital with food poisoning. Jonathan tells Reva, who is trying to retrieve her medical records, it was from the potato salad, but brags that he never was ill after eating two helpings.",
        "Buzz lies in an examination room, half asleep. Suddenly, there are voices in the room. They all run together as echoes saying, \"Oh, Buzz, if only I could have spared you ..Jenna, you can't let him see you . Oh, relax, Nadine ..I just want to look at him Well, I do, too ..You are breaking the rules Will you two just stop your bickering You tell her, Sarah\". Buzz lies in silence, unable to hear the bantering voices echoing back and forth. Suddenly, as he lies quietly, Jenna appears whispering in his ear, \"Poor Buzz. Buzz, I've missed you .Our son is in trouble, you know that . Don't worry because I am here to help\". She starts to kiss him and is suddenly called back by Nadine's voice. Buzz suddenly sits bolt upright.",
        "Jenna finds Coop outside Cedars crying and starts to talk to him. He is so glad to see his mom and hugs her tightly. They talk about the baby and he tells her a baby needs two parents. They walk around Main Street, looking at diamond rings. Later, Coop looks at the diamond ring in his pocket and starts to ask Lizzie something, but changes his mind.",
        "Harley sits in an exam room of Cedars Hospital looking at her cell phone. \"You're not supposed to have that in here\", Nadine says disapprovingly. A shocked Harley turns to the voice, \"Mommy\"? Nadine jumps up and runs to her side, grinning widely. Nadine and she talk about her role at Spaulding and Nadine makes her realize that she was not nice to Dinah. She decides to help Dinah.",
        "Meanwhile, inside Cedars Hospital, Reva stands up against a wall and hears Sarah say in a stern voice, \"Ah, Reva girl. Pulling away is not the answer. You know better than that\". \"Mama, you're here\", Reva says happily. \"I'm here to give ya a swift kick in the britches\", Sarah retorts. Sarah tries to convince Reva that she needs to fight for her life.",
        "Cassie prepares for discharge from Cedars and hears, \"I'm sorry I missed out on your life, Cassie, and you mine. G-d knows I regretted it until the day I died\". Cassie turns and with a shocked smile says, \"Sarah\"? \"Better late than never\", Sarah laughs. Sarah tells her that she needs to learn to let go of Jeffrey and Tammy. Cassie asks her who her father is and Sarah tells her that she will know when the time is right. Cassie and Reva meet up again and both agree that Sarah can make their fears and doubts go away for a while.",
        "At Company, Jenna and Nadine critique Olivia. Nadine thinks she is right for Buzz and Jenna disagrees. When Frank comes in, Nadine tells the two of them, who are oblivious to her presence, that they will work everything out. She gently touches Franks face and he turns around, seeing nothing. Buzz cannot understand what went wrong with the potato salad. Emma sees \"shiny ladies\".",
        "Back at the site of the Mother's Day picnic, Jenna, Sarah and Nadine meet. \"Our work is done her girls\", Nadine grins to Jenna, holding her hand. \"That is until the next time, of course\", adds Jenna. \"That's right, girls; a mama's work never really ends\", says Sarah. Nadine says, \"Wait! Who's got the stuff we put in the potato salad\"? Sarah holds up a bottle and shrieks, \"Castor Oil. My kids always did hate this stuff\". The three giggle as they fade away",
        "As the closing theme music is playing, Harley thinks about Nadine and says,\" Mommies are always there. Frank senses Nadine blowing a kiss. Coop tells Jenna happy Mother's Day. Cassie stares in awe at Sarah. Reva hugs Sarah and weeps, \"I love you mom\"."

        "Lizzie: You did. What did he say?",

        "Jenna: Coop, what do you really, really want?",
        "Coop: It's not about what I want. It's about the kind of man I am.",
        "Jenna: Oh, coop. Oh, I like that one over there. Oh, yes, I would say that's one- and-a-half carats, emerald cut, sbs1g. I've always had a favorite for diamonds. That was a jewel thing, but that was momentary.",
        "Coop: You know that's probably going to run me more than I make in a month, right?",
        "Jenna: Six months to a year. I can always show you how to vomit. It was just a thought.",

        "Jenna: You're so right. If I had to do it again...",
        "Coop: But you don't. And I pretty much just get one shot at this.",

        "Nadine: So my little girl is the big cheese now.",
        "Harley: Can you believe it?",
        "Nadine: What I always dreamed for you when you were little. I don't know about the power suits and all of that. But you must love the money and the power, and you're in the paper all the time.",
        "Harley: I know.",
        "Nadine: I know it was rewarding being a cop, but this, baby, you're a star.",
        "Harley: I'm so glad you're here, even though I'm pretty sure it is because of bad mayonnaise.",
        "Nadine: Maybe.",
        "Harley: I don't have time for this. I don't have time to be sick. I have a business meeting.",
        "Nadine: Great. I get to see you in action.",
        "Harley: The deal went through.",
        "Nadine: That's great. So, the business is going good?",
        "Harley: Oh, incredible.",
        "Nadine: Oh, I'm so happy for you, baby. Oh, look, champagne. I know you were going off track there for a while, you were worried so much about being a stay-at-home mom, but I always knew you were destined for something more. I saw it in the stars. So, I would like to make a toast, to my beautiful daughter, a real powerhouse.",
        "Harley: Oh, mom.",
        "Nadine: Congratulations, honey. So, I guess you're one of them, now. What? Is something wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: This is grandma Sarah. I didn't know you still carried this.",
        "Cassie: I don't. But I thought I would today. Mother's Day and all.",

        "Cassie: Thanks, sweetie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: You're not here, you're not here.",
        "Sarah: Oh, yes, I am, I come and go when I choose.",
        "Reva: You're not changing your mind, Mama. And you can't play those tricks on me anymore because I'm a grown woman.",
        "Sarah: And you're just as stubborn and silly as ever, but we are going to talk about the \"c\" word, and I'm not talking about \"cellulite\".",
        "Reva: It's my decision, Mama, please stay out of it.",
        "Sarah: I can't. As much as I want you with me, I'm not ready yet. Not like this.",
        "Reva: Do you think I want to die, Mama? I don't. I don't want to die. And I am a fighter. But I'm not going to spend my life going through a series of awful treatments just because some stiff of a doctor wants to be safe.",
        "Sarah: Wake up, child. What you're doing isn't fighting. It's running.",
        "Reva: You act like this is the easiest thing in the world for me. But it's not, Mama, not anymore. I've been in and out of this hospital so many times this past year. That's not how I'm going to spend the rest of my life, with tests and needles and blood work. I can't do it.",
        "Sarah: Baby girl, you have no choice.",
        "Reva: Wrong! This is my life, Mama, mine! And I'll live it the way I choose to live it. Do you know that Josh and I just got together after being split up for the umpteenth time? I'm not going to do that again, and he isn't, either.",
        "Sarah: Well, why don't you let Joshua be the judge of that?",
        "Reva: And let him uproot his life for some stupid lump? No, Mama. He is involved in the biggest project of his career.",
        "Sarah: Oh, I know all about that.",
        "Reva: You know that Joshua's dream is Harlan's dream, and if Josh can make that a reality --",
        "Sarah: You're full of excuses, aren't you?",
        "Reva: I'm scared. I'm scared.",
        "Sarah: I know you are, darlin'. I know, I know. You are in the fight of your life. Now, you think your family needs you, especially that Jonathan, boy, does he remind me of you. But, honey, you need them, too.",
        "Reva: I wish I was as strong as you are.",
        "Sarah: You are. I made sure of that. And don't forget that other gift I gave you.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) Cassie. She's the best.",
        "Sarah: That's right. And you need Cassie. And she needs you. Now think about this for a minute. Think about your sister, and your kids and your husband. And then tell me you don't still have fight in you.",
        "Reva: ( Sobbing ) I love you, Mama.",
        "Sarah: I love you, too, baby. Now, you stop running and start fighting.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Singer: I am determined not to let this get in my way what if, what then, what now god, it's strange how life can change oh, in a moment.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse: Now just take it easy and get some rest if you can. Your mother will understand.",
        "Cassie: My mother? Oh, my mother is not around.",
        "Nurse: Oh, I'm sorry.",
        "Cassie: Oh, no, really, it's okay. I never even knew her, actually.",
        "Sarah: I'm sorry I missed out on your life, Cassie. And you, mine. God knows I regretted it till the day I died.",
        "Cassie: Sarah?",
        "Sarah: Better late than never.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Mom, mommy, I'm not like the Spauldings.",
        "Nadine: Honey, I meant that as a compliments.",
        "Harley: I went to the company to change its image, to do good things. Not for power and money. And so that Zach would not be ashamed of where he came from.",
        "Nadine: So you're doing this all for him?",
        "Harley: Yes, and Gus.",
        "Nadine: Well, that's different. How would you say things are going so far?",
        "Harley: I would say that I have had a lot of success.",
        "Nadine: You mean with that photographer the other day?",
        "Harley: You know about that. Of course you know about that. Yeah, Gus had a minor painkiller problem.",
        "Nadine: I know, and it's too bad. And it's a crying shame about what happened to poor Mallet. Well, I know he turned out to be a deadbeat husband, but to take a bullet...",
        "Harley: I know. Gus really slipped up. I know. You should talk.",
        "Nadine: All right, I know you're right. I was a major screw-up.",
        "Harley: Yeah.",
        "Nadine: There are no two ways about that. I know I was selfish, but at least when you do bad stuff, you do it for the right reason.",
        "Harley: What bad stuff? What are you talking about?",
        "Nadine: You know, that stuff with Dinah and that ugly business with Ross. Oh, Ross, he was such a lovely man. But you know, there will be a lot of fallout from this business, and it could affect your bottom line.",
        "Harley: I turned into Alan Spaulding, with blonde hair and boobs.",
        "Nadine: ( Laughs ) oh, baby, you said it; I didn't.",
        "Harley: You know, I'm dropping the ball with my friends, I'm letting them down all over the place. What in the.... in the name of good business? When did it all go so wrong?",
        "Nadine: No, honey. The better question is: How do you make it right?",
        "( Knock on the door )",
        "Harley: No, and I don't even know what that is. Mom, I want a Buzz burger.",
        "Nadine: I don't think that would be so good for your stomach.",
        "Harley: I'm fine. I've never felt better. I want a Buzz burger.",
        "Nadine: Then say it again. But say it louder.",
        "Harley: I want a Buzz burger.",
        "Buzz: Okay, you don't have to yell.",

        "Nadine: Of course he is. He has Buzz's heart.",
        "Olivia: That bad?",
        "Buzz: I poisoned half the town.",
        "Olivia: Well, it's not great, but I sure would not mind shedding a few pounds.",
        "Buzz: And vital organs.",
        "Olivia: No one blames you, Buzz. They love you. How could they not?",
        "Nadine: Here we go.",
        "Jenna: What?",
        "Nadine: I've got to do something for my other kid.",
        "Nadine: This is a mess, Buzz really seems to care for her.",
        "Jenna: But she is with Frank, she would break his heart.",
        "Nadine: Like we didn't.",
        "Jenna: Nadine, take a look at her, her track record.",
        "Nadine: At least she doesn't have a police record. What if she is just right for him?",
        "Jenna: Oh, that's a good one. And then what happens to Frank?",
        "Frank: Where is Emma? Where is she? How you doing?",
        "Olivia: We were waiting for you.",
        "Frank: Well?",
        "Olivia: I wanted to say thank you.",
        "Frank: For what?",
        "Olivia: For helping Emma. I believe you helped her dial 1- 800-flowers, and she gave me the most beautiful Mother's Day bouquet.",
        "Frank: Good job, Emma. ( Laughter )",
        "Buzz: And we're celebrating Mother's Day with a peach pie.",
        "Olivia: Emma's favorite.",
        "Jenna: She certainly seems to have put a nice wedge between father and son.",
        "Nadine: True, but I don't think she is out to hurt Frank. He just needs someone different, another Laney. But I like her.",
        "Jenna: No, no, she is wrong for both of them. Just look at her, honestly. Although she does have some rather nice...",
        "Nadine: You call that an intervention?",
        "Jenna: Who's side are you on anyway?",
        "Nadine: Buzz's and Frankie's.",
        "Jenna: Well then you better hope she makes up her mind before she hurts both of them.",
        "Buzz: Would you like a piece of pie, Emma?",
        "Emma: Give it to the shiny ladies.",
        "Buzz: Shiny ladies? What shiny ladies?",

        "Lizzie: Great. Thanks. Why do you want to stop by here on our way?",
        "Coop: Well, there is something I wanted to talk to you about.",
        "Lizzie: Okay.",
        "Coop: You know how things have gotten a little weird since we found out that you were pregnant? And nobody knows where they stand and our families... well, you know, our families.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah.",
        "Coop: Lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: What is that string for? Are you supposed to remember something? Coop?",

        "Cassie: I guess I have good genes.",
        "Sarah: But we do share one flaw, though.",
        "Cassie: Um, this isn't normally what happens when...",
        "Sarah: Just hear me out. You need to learn to let go.",
        "Cassie: You think I'm holding onto Jeffrey?",
        "Sarah: And that pretty little granddaughter of mine.",
        "Cassie: That's not the same thing. And as far as Jeffrey goes...",
        "Sarah: All I want you to do is think about it. Aside from that, you're darn near perfect. And I couldn't be more proud.",
        "Cassie: Mama, there is something I've always wanted to ask you. Who was my father?",
        "Sarah: You'll know when the time is right. But until then, you just remember that I am always here in your heart.",

        "Cassie: Reva, have you... have you ever seen...",
        "Reva: Seen what?",
        "Cassie: Never mind.",
        "Reva: She's one tough cookie, isn't she?",
        "Cassie: But she's so warm.",
        "Reva: And you're feeling better?",
        "Cassie: I am. It's strange, but it's like all my doubts and fears were just kind of washed away. For the moment, anyway.",
        "Reva: For the moment, anyway. I was kind of thinking the same thing myself.",

No, nothing is wrong. Listen, do me a favor. Why don't you grab mallet and come back to town? I'm going to have the jet fueled and ready to go. Dinah, my good friend Dinah, she needs me.",
