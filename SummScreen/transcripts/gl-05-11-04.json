        "Jeffrey: All right, go ahead. I can hear you.",
        "Danny: Yeah, I'm at Towers, waiting for Salerno. There's a boat coming in tonight from San Cristobel, and Salerno's been acting very protective of its cargo. I'm guessing it's got something to do with this big score he's planning.",
        "Jeffrey: Where did you get this?",
        "Danny: Tony, but he doesn't know I know. I saw him write it down.",
        "Jeffrey: All right. Well, give me the information. Tonight, you said.",
        "Danny: The \"gilded lily,\" from san Cristobel, pier 14. You know what this could be.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, the antimonious shipment we've been waiting for.",
        "Danny: Right, and if it is and you can nail Salerno, then we're square, right?",
        "Jeffrey: No, Danny, wrong. We're going to follow the antimonious and we're going to find out how and where the mob is turning it into \"D.\" And then, and only then, we'll be square. In the meantime, I want you to stay on Salerno. I'll follow brad green. And do not-- I repeat, do not-- go anywhere near the docks tonight. You got it? My agents will take it from here.",
        "Marie: Why is customs making such a fuss? I do this all the time and I have never had so much paperwork to fill out. Harley. Thank you so much for coming all the way down here to meet with me about our little project, especially since I have been unavoidably detained.",
        "Harley: So, what's going on, Marie? You going on vacation?",
        "Marie: Oh, I wish. No, I collect antiques, and I have a very large shipment coming in tonight from another country. I don't know why there are so many extra forms to fill out today. You'd think I was smuggling drugs or something.",
        "Travel agent: Good news, Mrs. Green. Customs says the shipment is ready and will arrive tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Hey there, Mr. Ambassador. Sandy Foster is reporting for duty.",
        "Edmund: Well, you're quite the morning person, aren't you, Sandy?",
        "Sandy: Well, I have to be. People seem to need me early in the day.",
        "Edmund: Yes, well, I appreciate you showing up on such short notice, but you're a bit before you're time.",
        "Sandy: Okay.",
        "Edmund: So if you'll excuse me, I'll just take care of a few things and then I'll be right with you, all right?",
        "Sandy: All right. All right. Take your time. I'll be at Olivia's, tossing back some shots of juice.",
        "Edmund: Terrific. Put it on my tab.",
        "Sandy: You got it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Bring it down a little. You are more beautiful than the last time I saw you.",
        "Cassie: That was five minutes ago.",
        "Edmund: Well, still, it's true.",
        "Cassie: Thank you. That's very nice of you. It's nice for someone to say something nice to me for a change.",
        "Edmund: So are you going to have another talk with Tammy this morning?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I was going to talk to her before she left to go to school, and then I thought I'd probably wait until she came home from school. Then I thought maybe she'd be busy, so I could wait until after that, but... I'm usually not this much of a chicken. There's just so much rejection I can take. Then there's the whole flipping of the hair, \"mind your own business\" thing that...",
        "Edmund: That's not true. Sometimes she does the eye-roll, \"mind your own business\" thing. Well, I think I'll make myself scarce, all right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Hey. We missed you at breakfast this morning.",
        "Tammy: I wasn't hungry. And now I have to go, so...",
        "Cassie: Wait, wait, wait. So what's on the agenda today?",
        "Tammy: Uh, school?",
        "Cassie: I know school, but you look so pretty. Is it a special day?",
        "Tammy: It's senior fun day, remember?",
        "Cassie: Oh, right, yeah. Well, that should be fun. (Laughs)",
        "Tammy: Original, mom. Can I go now or do you want to drill me some more?",
        "Cassie: You can go. I love you, Tammy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: Hey, beautiful.",
        "Tammy: Oh. Isn't it a gorgeous day out? Perfect day.",
        "Joey: Okay. You're in a good mood today. How come?",
        "Tammy: You know why, silly. Today's the day we run away together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: Oh, you're up. I was going to bring you breakfast in bed.",
        "Olivia: Were you? That's very sweet.",
        "Phillip: Well, sweets for the sweet. How did you sleep?",
        "Olivia: All right. Although I did have this very strange dream in the middle of the night.",
        "Phillip: That's usually when they come.",
        "Olivia: Yeah. You were... you were here in my room and you were standing over me, just staring. But you wouldn't do that to me, I mean, purposely try and scare me like that, right?",
        "Phillip: Did I scare you, honey? I'm sorry.",
        "Olivia: So you were here.",
        "Phillip: Yeah. I... I had a really strange dream that someone was trying to harm you. So I got up and I came in here to make sure that you were all right. And I walked in and I saw you laying so still and so pale in the moonlight. You looked so beautiful that I guess I did just gaze down at you for a few moments thinking about how much I love you and how lucky I am to have you in my life. Juice?",
        "Olivia: No, thanks.",
        "Phillip: You know, this color is so becoming on you.",
        "Olivia: Thanks. And you look very handsome in your suit.",
        "Phillip: Thank you.",
        "Olivia: What's the occasion?",
        "Phillip: No occasion. Just going to the office.",
        "Olivia: Why?",
        "Phillip: To go to work. Listen, I can't tell you how much I appreciate you covering for me while I was sick, but I feel... I feel perfectly fine now, so I'll take it from here.",
        "Phillip: Olivia, what's wrong? We discussed my going back to work just last night.",
        "Olivia: I know, I just thought you meant in a few weeks, not today. I just think it's too soon.",
        "Phillip: Oh, well, I don't.",
        "Olivia: Well, you just got out of the hospital. Don't you think you ought to ease back into things?",
        "Phillip: No, I don't see any need for that. I feel perfectly fine.",
        "Olivia: Well, it's just crazy at the office. It can be so stressful.",
        "Phillip: You know that's true. I don't know how you managed to juggle all that extra responsibility with everything else that you've already got on your plate. Mother, stepmother, owning half the beacon. My God, you must be exhausted. You're the one that needs to rest.",
        "Olivia: I don't. I'm fine.",
        "Phillip: You do, and you will. Relax. Rest. Spend time with our little angel. Let me carry the burden for a while. That's what married couples do, Olivia. They look after each other, in sickness and in health, until death parts them.",
        "Olivia: Look, I appreciate your willingness to help, okay?",
        "Phillip: Then what's the problem?",
        "Olivia: I just...",
        "Phillip: What? You don't trust me?",
        "Olivia: ...Think it's too soon.",
        "Phillip: Don't think I'm up to the task?",
        "Olivia: No. It's too soon.",
        "Phillip: I didn't realize there was a timetable.",
        "Olivia: There isn't a timetable. Look, there's a matter of an investigation going on, a federal investigation at Spaulding right now.",
        "Phillip: Right, which will be my first priority.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, but here's the thing. I have positioned myself just so on this issue with the press, with the stockholders. Right now, I am the person best able to keep this company's image intact. Ask Alan, he agrees with me. I can be such an asset to you, if you will let me.",
        "Phillip: Oh, Olivia, I know full well what an asset you can be. I just see you functioning in a somewhat different capacity.",
        "Olivia: What's that?",
        "Phillip: Being my loyal wife and helpmate. Pouring on the charm at cocktail parties and the country club, and so forth. Taking care of our little angel. Keeping those home fires burning, showing everyone that you support your husband 100%.",
        "Olivia: That'll just free you up to do the real work?",
        "Phillip: Hey, don't minimize your contribution. I just think that's how you can help best right now.",
        "Olivia: Well, yeah, that's one way I can help, but that's not going to...",
        "Phillip: Good, I'm glad it's settled. You know what? I'm probably going to be late, so give a kiss to Emma for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: We're running away?",
        "Tammy: I told you yesterday when we were at the mall.",
        "Joey: Right, but I didn't think you meant it.",
        "Tammy: It's not really like running away. It's really taking a day off to recharge.",
        "Joey: Does this have anything to do with your mom?",
        "Tammy: One thing has nothing to do with the other.",
        "Joey: You sure?",
        "Tammy: Joey, when was the last time I played hooky, huh? Never. Not once. How many times did you cut school?",
        "Joey: Um... uh...",
        "Tammy: Yeah. Well, how come every time you or Lizzie or one of our other friends does something wild, it's cool. But as soon as I do it, it's, like, oh, there's something the matter with me.",
        "Joey: Tammy, I wasn't saying...",
        "Tammy: All I do is go to school and baby-sit and do homework, and...",
        "Joey: You make a great Juliet.",
        "Tammy: It's senior fun day. That's all I want to do: Have fun. They'll be really loose about taking attendance at school. This is a golden opportunity. We must seize it, Romeo.",
        "Joey: You're a nut.",
        "Tammy: Are you saying you don't want to have fun with me?",
        "Joey: No, I'm not saying I don't want to have fun with you. I'm just saying all I've got is $15 in my wallet, and I don't know how much fun we can have with that.",
        "Tammy: Don't worry. Where we're going, we won't need any money. The Bauer cabin, up by the lake. Michelle said we could use it. She already gave me the keys. I packed us some food and some CDs, a whole bunch of stuff.",
        "Joey: You're serious. Michelle knows it's just going to be the two of us, and she's cool with that?",
        "Tammy: Well, not exactly, but who cares?",
        "Joey: Tammy, what about your mom? You know, if she finds out, we could be in some serious trouble, you know? Your parents could forbid you to see me.",
        "Tammy: Joey, are you backing out on me?",
        "Joey: No, I'm not backing out. I'm just saying, think of the repercussions. Your parents forbidding...",
        "Tammy: Parents? Plural? Where did you get that? Because I only have one parent: My mother.",
        "Joey: I know, I know. It's just your uncle Edmund acts like a dad.",
        "Tammy: Well, he's not, okay? And if he acts like it, it's just that: It's an act.",
        "Joey: I know, but from the way he's looking at us right now, it's pretty dad- like to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Good morning, Tammy. Joey. That's an awfully big bag. What's in it?",
        "Eden: We don't have to do this now, Bill. We can do it another time.",
        "Bill: No, no, no, no, no. Come on. We're here to discuss the wedding. Come here. Nothing's going to ruin that, all right? Yes, yes, come on. It's a beautiful day, and no one's going to ruin that, okay? All right, so tell me, what's this great idea that Harley has, huh? Some sort of theme for your shower?",
        "Eden: Our shower.",
        "Bill: Oh, yeah, sorry.",
        "Eden: And Harley is thinking \"tropical paradise.\" Palm trees, steel band, jerk pork, and rum drinks.",
        "Bill: Well, will you be wearing a grass skirt?",
        "Eden: If you are especially nice to me, and you ply me with lots of rum drinks.",
        "Bill: Will it be a very, very short grass skirt? You know, with coconuts that are placed in strategic...",
        "Eden: I think that we should wait for the honeymoon for that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Salerno: The coffee better be strong here.",
        "Danny: Good morning, Vinnie. What's the matter? You didn't sleep well last night?",
        "Salerno: Nah, I never sleep good away from home. I like things familiar, just a certain way. And speaking of things I like, there's the blushing bride herself.",
        "Bill: Will there be sand and a little limbo stick that we...",
        "Eden: Honey, what?",
        "Bill: I was thinking maybe we'll have the little umbrellas in the drinks, you know? Like the little... Vinnie Salerno with Danny Santos. Well, good thing Danny didn't win the election that dirt-bag would be running this city. He keeps staring over here. Has he been starting at you?",
        "Eden: No, no, no. Don't worry about it. Let it go. It's nothing.",
        "Bill: My goodness, what is going... has he been staring? How long has he been staring at you like that?",
        "Eden: Don't worry about it, okay?",
        "Bill: You know what? Maybe I should go talk to him, okay?",
        "Eden: Bill, don't. No, no, no. Just sit down. It's not worth it.",
        "Bill: Don't worry. I'm just going to go talk. Relax.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marie: So what has my darling faithful husband been up to in san Cristobel?",
        "Harley: Well, you were right about one thing:E's been running down there on average every two weeks. But if he's got a girlfriend, he has kept her very well-hidden. Here's a copy of all his credit card purchases the last four times he was down on the island. You can look at them, but nothing rings a bell. He's checked himself into a double room in the hotel, but as you can see form his hotel bill, all the room service charges have been for one person. And here's a copy of his phone records. Now I've highlighted all the repeat numbers, see? And I'm checking on those, but so far, there's nothing.",
        "Marie: Boy, you are thorough, aren't you, Harley?",
        "Harley: That's what you're paying me for.",
        "Marie: I had no ia that a private detective could acquire all this information. I thought you had to be with law enforcement.",
        "Harley: Well, I've made a few connections.",
        "Marie: I'll say. My release. Finally. The shipment arrives tonight, pier 14, the \"gilded lily\" from San Cristobel.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Joey, if you'll excuse us for a minute, please? I'd like to have a word alone with Tammy.",
        "Tammy: I don't have time. I have to get to school.",
        "Edmund: Well, not according to my watch. So that's an awfully large knapsack, Tammy. You didn't have it when you came downstairs this morning.",
        "Tammy: I was storing it behind the desk. It's my science project. It's due today. Take it out to the car for me, would you, Joey? I'll be right out there in a sec.",
        "Joey: Sure.",
        "Tammy: I don't appreciate you grilling me in front of my boyfriend, uncle Edmund. In fact, I don't appreciate you grilling me, period. You have no right. You're not my father.",
        "Edmund: No. You're right, Tammy, I'm not. What I do seem to be at the moment is the person you're angry at, not your mother. So why don't you lighten up on her a bit, all right?",
        "Tammy: I think you might need to say that a little bit louder. I'm not sure she heard you.",
        "Edmund: Who heard?",
        "Tammy: Mom. She's standing right over there. Like you didn't know? Your concerned act is all for her benefit.",
        "Edmund: Tammy...",
        "Tammy: Don't deny it.",
        "Edmund: Tammy, I understand you feel your mother and I violated...",
        "Tammy: (Scoffs) oh, I don't just feel it. I know it. Excuse me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: So did that go as well as it looked?",
        "Edmund: Oh, even better.",
        "Sandy: Hey. What's up, Joe?",
        "Joey: What's going on, sandy?",
        "Sandy: You know, I was thinking about you the other day. I was watching the Yankee/mariner game. I've been catching up on my baseball because of you and my brother.",
        "Joey: That's cool. We should catch some games this summer.",
        "Sandy: Yeah. And I'd like to see you play. Not much baseball where I grew up.",
        "Joey: I can imagine.",
        "Sandy: So how's project Tammy coming?",
        "Joey: It's amazing. Things have completely changed. She can't stay away from me.",
        "Sandy: Excellent.",
        "Joey: Yeah, I don't even know why.",
        "Sandy: Oh, don't over-think it. Just enjoy.",
        "Joey: Enjoy. Right. Hey, beautiful.",
        "Sandy: Hi, little cousin.",
        "Tammy: Hi, sandy. What are you doing here so early?",
        "Sandy: Edmund summoned me. So what's up with you guys today? You off to school or are you going to play hooky on this beautiful day?",
        "Tammy: Oh, no, we're definitely going to school. Don't want to get in trouble this close to the end of it, you know?",
        "Sandy: Yeah. You're such a good girl, Tammy. Well, you guys enjoy school. I'm going to get back to work. Adios.",
        "Joey: I didn't tell him, but if I did, it's not like he'd tell anyone, anyway. He'd keep a secret.",
        "Tammy: Secret's half the fun.",
        "Joey: So what about uncle e? He suspects anything?",
        "Tammy: Oh, no. No problem. Bauer cabin, here we come.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Well, things are looking up already, huh?",
        "Phillip: Phillip Spaulding reporting for duty.",
        "Alexandra: Darling, for heaven's sakes, I really wasn't expecting you this morning, but it's wonderful. You're looking wonderful.",
        "Phillip: I'm feeling wonderful, and I can't tell you how good it is to be back.",
        "Alexandra: Well, where's Olivia?",
        "Phillip: Where's Olivia?",
        "Alexandra: Well, I just presumed you two might be driving in together.",
        "Phillip: Olivia is at home where she belongs, spending quality time with our little girl.",
        "Alexandra: Oh. Well. Things are really looking much brighter, aren't they?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Danny. Power breakfast with an old friend?",
        "Danny: Some friends are more loyal than others.",
        "Bill: We haven't been formally introduced. Bill lewis.",
        "Salerno: Yeah, I know who you are.",
        "Bill: Well, you do. Good. Well, that saves me a little time explaining, then. (Cell phone ringing)",
        "Danny: Sorry. Excuse me for a second. (Whispers): What?",
        "Jeffrey: Did he show?",
        "Danny: Yeah. So?",
        "Jeffrey: I need more information about that shipment, Danny. I'm getting conflicting reports.",
        "Danny: Yeah, whatever.",
        "Bill: Now, look, I know you and Eden are old friends.",
        "Salerno: Oh, yeah. Your girlfriend and I go way back.",
        "Bill: See, she's not my girlfriend. She's my fianc\u00e9e. We're getting married.",
        "Salerno: I heard.",
        "Bill: You did? That's great. Well, then maybe you'd understand, maybe it's time to stop sending the champagne and the flowers and the gifts, and at the very least stop drooling every time you look at her. Can you do that?",
        "Salerno: Excuse me?",
        "Danny: No, no, no, no. Vinnie, excuse us. Do you mind? I'd like to talk to you. Are you out of your mind? You keep that up and you won't live long enough to marry Eden.",
        "Bill: Oh, you got some nerve.",
        "Danny: Me?",
        "Bill: Telling me to beware the consequences? You should have used that advice yourself in the campaign. Unbelievable, Danny. It didn't take long to get back in the old life, did it? And that's me assuming that you even got out of it to begin with, huh? Salerno the one who helped you buy all those votes during the election? Is that what happened?",
        "Danny: Bill, the campaign is over, all right? So why don't you get over it. Now what's with all this macho posturing nonsense that you're doing for your girlfriend?",
        "Bill: I don't like the way he's staring at my girl. It's...",
        "Danny: Too bad. Vinnie the fox is not someone you antagonize unless you have a death wish.",
        "Bill: You know what? He's playing these games with Eden, and I'm not taking it.",
        "Danny: What do you expect? Bill? Salerno's got a thing for Eden. He still wants her, but you've got her. You won. So just ignore the guy.",
        "Bill: You know what? That's easy for you to say. Why don't you do me a favor? Just go back to your table, talk about whatever business you need to talk about, but tell him to keep away from my girl. Okay? Enjoy your breakfast.",
        "Salerno: That kid runs lewis construction now, right?",
        "Danny: Oh, yeah. He's a punk.",
        "Salerno: A punk who needs to be taken down a peg.",
        "Danny: You're telling me, Vinnie. He has been pulling this holier- than-thou crap ever since I lost the election.",
        "Salerno: How so?",
        "Danny: But you know, this deal I was telling you I'm working on? It involves lewis.",
        "Salerno: Oh.",
        "Danny: Let me put it this way, Vinnie. If you go after bill lewis now, you'll only be hurting him once. But if we follow my plan, by the time we're through with him, he'll have lost everything and everyone. He will suffer for the rest of his life.",
        "Salerno: Sounds good. Just make sure that happens, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Jeffrey O'Neill, I have a bone to pick with you. Gus is buried under mountains of paperwork, and he says your office is to blame.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, if your boyfriend can't handle his duties, you know, it's not my office's fault, is it?",
        "Harley: Sit down. I just came from seeing Marie green. I was giving her the lowdown on brad's activities when he was down in san Cristobel and guess where I found her?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, how the hell should I know?",
        "Harley: Smooth. I found her talking to a customs agent about a shipment of antiques she has coming in tonight by boat from san Cristobel. So if Marie is in on brad's deal to divert antimonious...",
        "Jeffrey: An antiques shipment would be the perfect cover.",
        "Harley: Exactly. And I wrote down the name of the ship.",
        "Jeffrey: \"The gilded lily.\" Pier 14.",
        "Harley: How did you know that?",
        "Jeffrey: Vinnie the fox has got another shipment off that same boat tonight.",
        "Harley: Okay, do not yank my chain.",
        "Jeffrey: No, I'll leave that up to your boyfriend.",
        "Harley: Do you know what this means? Do you have any idea what this means?",
        "Jeffrey: I know what it could mean.",
        "Harley: Okay. So what's next?",
        "Edmund: So, as I get more and more involved in planning this whole event...",
        "Harley: The first annual san Cristobel festival.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Right. Well, sorry I haven't come up with a catchier title yet.",
        "Sandy: Ah, the title's fine.",
        "Edmund: I keep thinking that I need some help, and I go over the logical choices and guess who's come to mind?",
        "Sandy: Aunt Olivia.",
        "Edmund: Well, no, no. She's got a bit of a full plate at the moment. You, I've been thinking of you.",
        "Sandy: Ah.",
        "Edmund: Well, I think it makes good sense, doesn't it? You were very impressive in putting on the whole \"Romeo and Juliet\" project. And you are, after all, the son of the former crown prince of the country.",
        "Sandy: Yeah. Well, I'm sorry, Edmund. I think you've got the wrong guy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Just find out what my legal rights are and get back to me. Damn. Damn. Damn, damn.",
        "Cassie: Wow. It's been one of those days, huh? What happened? Did Emma, like, roll her eyes at you and flip her hair?",
        "Olivia: What? What?",
        "Cassie: Nothing, nothing. What's going on? Talk to me.",
        "Olivia: Phillip. Phillip is home and he thinks he's better, and he went in to work today.",
        "Cassie: Right. That's great, olivia.",
        "Olivia: He had the audacity to tell me that my services were no longer needed at Spaulding.",
        "Cassie: Oh. So much for taking over the universe.",
        "Olivia: He also suggested I might want to stay home and keep those home fires burning.",
        "Cassie: Did he actually say that phrase?",
        "Olivia: I worked my tail off getting the press on our side and making... stroking the feds so that his family legacy won't go down the toilet.",
        "Cassie: Well, it is his family legacy.",
        "Olivia: No, it isn't. It's my family legacy, too. I'm the mother of his child. So if he thinks I'm going to stay at home and bake cookies while he throws our daughter's future away, he's got another thing coming.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Well, I can't believe you convinced Olivia to stay at home.",
        "Phillip: I didn't convince her. I didn't give her any choice.",
        "Alexandra: Oh.",
        "Phillip: Children grow up so quickly. Why should Olivia miss precious time with Emma when I'm ready, willing, and able to be back here at the office?",
        "Alexandra: Yes, she's a lucky lady, isn't she?",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm.",
        "Alexandra: Think of all the women out there who'd give anything in the world to stay home with their children, their babies, instead of trotting off to work everyday.",
        "Phillip: You should tell her that the next time you see her.",
        "Alexandra: (Laughs) of course I will, because Olivia lives for my words of wisdom.",
        "Phillip: Well, I better get to work. I don't want to disappoint that new bride of mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eden: Bill, what happened?",
        "Bill: What? I told him to enjoy the eggs benedict and \"keep your eyes on someone else's fianc\u00e9e, not mine.\"",
        "Eden: Honey, I appreciate you taking care of me, but you cannot go confronting guys like Vinnie Salerno. Bad things happen when he gets angry.",
        "Bill: Listen, listen, okay? You are out of that life, okay? You don't need to be intimidated by guys like that. No.",
        "Eden: You are the most amazing guy I've ever met.",
        "Bill: Well, then trust me, okay? I'm going to take care of you. Yes?",
        "Eden: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: I got you the Springfield paper, and the \"new York daily news.\"",
        "Salerno: Thanks.",
        "Danny: Vinnie, look, I know you're real busy with getting settled here in town. I know you've got something going on tonight. I know all these players here in Springfield. If you use me, I know I can help you.",
        "Salerno: You want to help?",
        "Danny: Yes, that's what I'm saying.",
        "Salerno: Then, get me some more coffee.",
        "Danny: Right. Sure.",
        "Salerno: No cream.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Voila. The Bauer cabin. So what do you think?",
        "Joey: It's out of a time warp or something.",
        "Tammy: Actually, I think they call it rustic.",
        "Joey: They got a TV?",
        "Tammy: No. I guess there's really not much to do here in terms of indoor activities. Unless you like to play games.",
        "Joey: What kind of games are we talking about?",
        "Tammy: Um... gin rummy, monopoly.",
        "Joey: Doctor.",
        "Tammy: Okay, down Romeo. So are you ready for some lunch?",
        "Joey: I'm always hungry, you know that.",
        "Tammy: Okay, I will get us something set up, and you can build a fire.",
        "Joey: Fire? Tammy, it's may. (Laughs)",
        "Tammy: But it's chilly in here. Plus a fire is so romantic.",
        "Joey: Like I said, I'm going to build a fire.",
        "Tammy: I brought us sandwiches and potato salad, and brownies for dessert.",
        "Joey: You brought wine?",
        "Tammy: No, soda. But I thought the nice glasses would make it more special. Same with these candles and stuff.",
        "Joey: You know what?",
        "Tammy: What?",
        "Joey: You are the classiest girl I know. Not to mention the smartest, the nicest, the most drop-dead gorgeous.",
        "Tammy: I kind of like you, too.",
        "Joey: \"Kind of\"?",
        "Tammy: Kind of a lot.",
        "Joey: Okay. I'm going to go light the fire, warm you up. How about I lay down a blanket? Maybe we can have, like, a picnic? Sound good?",
        "Tammy: Sounds perfect.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Sandy. Sandy, wait, wait, wait. Please, please. You will be the perfect choice for the job. It'll look great on any resume. The Spaulding's are sponsoring the project, so who knows where it can lead?",
        "Sandy: Yeah, well, thanks for thinking of me, but the last thing I want to think about right now is san Cristobel.",
        "Edmund: You know, I used to feel the same way, and I've really come to terms with my life there.",
        "Sandy: Well, good for you. My problem is that I was robbed of my life there. Sorry I can't help you. I've got to go. (Cell phone rings) talk to me. Now? Sure. I'm on the move. Peace.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Come on. I'm sure Phillip doesn't expect you to stay home and bake cookies. He has people who do those things, right?",
        "Olivia: This isn't funny.",
        "Cassie: Of course not. I know how much time and energy you've put in at Spaulding.",
        "Olivia: What do you mean? I'm not doing enough here?",
        "Cassie: No, I wasn't saying that.",
        "Olivia: I thought I explained to you yesterday how important it is for me to maintain influence at Spaulding. I can't let Phillip get the upper hand.",
        "Cassie: That's because you're afraid of him, and you think he's playing head- games with you.",
        "Olivia: No, I know he is.",
        "Cassie: Then why on earth would you be living in that house? I don't understand why you do the things you do. If he wants to go back to work at Spaulding, there's nothing you can do to stop him. (Telephone rings)",
        "Olivia: Yes, there is. Here.",
        "Cassie: Hello, the beacon? Yes, this is Mrs. Winslow. Yes, it's Tammy's mom. Is something wrong? Well, I don't understand that. I saw Tammy leave here just a half an hour ago with Joey Lupo. So maybe if you check... he's not here, either? Okay. Yes, will you please call me as soon as you hear anything? I'll do the same. Bye.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, what's wrong?",
        "Cassie: Tammy and Joey didn't show up for school. So that means they've either been in a car accident or they've skipped.",
        "Edmund: Well, nothing makes sense, because if it was a car accident, someone would have called.",
        "Cassie: Right.",
        "Edmund: And she wouldn't have skipped school. She had that huge science project due today.",
        "Cassie: What science project?",
        "Edmund: I don't know. It was quite cumbersome. She was lugging it around in her knapsack.",
        "Cassie: She doesn't have a science project due today. All of her lab work was turned in for the semester. She told me herself that today was senior fun day.",
        "Edmund: If she's not there having senior fun?",
        "Cassie: Then she's skipped. What if her and Joey ran off together?",
        "Edmund: No, I can't see that.",
        "Cassie: What do you mean, you can't see it? She's furious with us. She thinks we betrayed her. She's been acting incredibly defiant, and now she's gone off without telling anyone, with a packed bag? I'm sorry, but I have a really bad feeling about this.",
        "Edmund: Okay, okay. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let's call Tammy on her cell phone. If she doesn't answer, we'll take it from there. We'll track her down. Don't worry, Cassie, we'll find her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: But if you're keeping Gus so busy, what am I supposed to do?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, if you shut up, I'll tell you. I want you to go down to pier 14 and check out that ship, the \"gilded lily.\"",
        "Harley: I was so hoping you would say that.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm going to send some of my men to back you up, okay?",
        "Harley: No, no, no, no, no, no. No, we can't risk Marie green or Salerno making one of your guys. Not when we're this close.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, they're not going to be wearing jackets that say \"fed\" on the front.",
        "Harley: No, no, no, they'll just be dock workers or fishermen with ear-pieces and crew cuts talking into their collars. No, no, no, no, I do this alone. That's it.",
        "Jeffrey: Harley. Harley.",
        "Harley: Or you can find somebody else to go down to the dock.",
        "Jeffrey: All right, if you feel that strongly about it.",
        "Harley: And I better not see any feds at that dock tonight.",
        "Jeffrey: Don't worry, you won't see them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Tammy, please call me the second you get this. I am very worried about you. Any word?",
        "Edmund: Well, I checked with buzz down at company and that coffeehouse Tammy and Joey like to go to. No one's seen them.",
        "Cassie: Marina, sandy, and Shayne haven't seen her, either. She ran away. This is the part where you tell me that she's going to come back, you know? Right? Please?",
        "Edmund: She'll come back, she'll come back. She will. I'm just going to make sure that's sooner rather than later. Just stay here and work the phones.",
        "Cassie: Where are you going? You don't know where she is.",
        "Edmund: No, I don't, but I think I know who does.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: All right, how about my fire? I did all right.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, you did great. You act, you sing, you play baseball, and you build a great fire. Is there anything that you don't do well?",
        "Joey: No.",
        "Tammy: Isn't this nice? No parents on our cases. No little brothers going through all my stuff. No whining phone calls from Lizzie begging me to get her out of her latest dumb move.",
        "Joey: That could have been Lizzie calling before, while we were eating lunch.",
        "Tammy: That's what voice mail is for.",
        "Joey: Yeah, you know what? You were right. I do like this. I like being alone up here with you.",

        "Danny: Here you go, Vinnie.",
        "Salerno: Thank you.",

        "Eden: Sure, if you want to. But why?",
        "Bill: I've got to go see her. Tell her what kind of company her husband's been keeping these days.",
        "Eden: Maybe she already knows.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, what kind of friend would I be if I didn't help her?",
        "Eden: Not a very good one, I guess.",
        "Bill: That's right.",
        "Eden: I want to be her friend, too, so...",
        "Bill: So, let's go. Come on.",
