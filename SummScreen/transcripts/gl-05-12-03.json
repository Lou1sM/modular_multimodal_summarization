        "Jeffrey: Good morning.",
        "Bell captain: Good morning, Mr. O'Neill.",
        "Jeffrey: Are there any messages for me?",
        "Bell captain: Let's see. Yes, a few actually.",
        "Jeffrey: Thank you. I need to speak with Mrs. Winslow. Is she going to be around this morning, do you know?",
        "Edmund: Mr. O'Neill. Good morning. We met last night when the gala was winding down.",
        "Jeffrey: I remember.",
        "Edmund: Right. If you're looking for my sister-in-law, I'm afraid she's not around this morning. But if you have a message for her, I could always pass it on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Knocking on door)",
        "Alexandra: Come on, Phillip. Phillip?! Oh. Nobody here but us chickens. Olivia... Elizabeth? Just when I thought you bedded every single available Spaulding. Where's Phillip?",
        "Olivia: Out for a run, according to his note.",
        "Lizzie: Hi, Aunt Alex. You got Dad's message, right?",
        "Alexandra: Message?",
        "Olivia: Yeah, his message. He left you a message on your machine saying that Lizzie was spending the night. She's very upset about her grandfather.",
        "Alexandra: Well, aren't we all? When will Phillip be back?",
        "Olivia: I don't know.",
        "Alexandra: Didn't take his cell phone with him? I tried calling him, but...",
        "Olivia: I don't know. Why? Is it important?",
        "Alexandra: Can't you just answer the question?",
        "Olivia: Not if you speak to me in that tone, I can't. Now what's got you so upset?",
        "Alexandra: I... I have... I just have to warn Phillip.",
        "Olivia: Warn him? About what?",
        "Alexandra: Not to go anywhere near the house today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: Well, I don't understand. Who... who... Nolan, what the hell is going on? I got a call while I was running on my cell phone to get here as soon as possible because this is something about a meeting with our attorney.",
        "Nolan: Right. That's right.",
        "Phillip: So...",
        "Nolan: I'm glad you here, but they just left a few minutes ago.",
        "Phillip: They left?",
        "Nolan: Yeah.",
        "Phillip: And nobody bothered to call me?",
        "Nolan: I don't know what to say to you, sir. I'm sorry.",
        "Phillip: They left? There's nobody here? Meeting's over.",
        "Alan: No. We're still having a meeting, just the two of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Hey, sis.",
        "Cassie: Hi.",
        "Reva: Hi.",
        "Cassie: Hi. So where do you want to go for lunch?",
        "Reva: I thought we were eating here.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, well, you know, I'm always here, so why don't we go somewhere else? Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: So the mayor, you know, told me that I should drop... Hey, there.",
        "Edmund: Oh, sorry. Sorry. You were saying?",
        "Jeffrey: I was saying that the mayor wanted me to meet your sister-in-law last night, but I didn't get the chance.",
        "Edmund: Right. Well, I'm sure the two of you will be catching up at some point. Hotel to your liking?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, it's fine.",
        "Edmund: Good.",
        "Jeffrey: You're not going to start doing that again, are you?",
        "Edmund: Doing?",
        "Jeffrey: The staring. You're staring at me again.",
        "Edmund: Sorry.",
        "Jeffrey: I know why you're doing it. And it's not because you want a date.",
        "Edmund: Well, I'm glad we have that point cleared up. (Laughter)",
        "Jeffrey: I look a lot like your deceased brother, don't I? Richard.",
        "Edmund: There's a slight resemblance, I suppose.",
        "Jeffrey: What, except for the beard?",
        "Edmund: That would be about it.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, look, I hope it's not going to be a problem for you, because, you know, we might be seeing a lot of each other around town.",
        "Edmund: No, it's nothing I don't think I can't handle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: You want to go to my place?",
        "Cassie: That's great. That's great. I could use some distance from this place.",
        "Reva: From the hotel? Work?",
        "Cassie: Edmund.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: All right. Well, the second you see Phillip, would you please tell him to call me?",
        "Olivia: No. You don't get to blast in here and blast out without giving me an explanation. Now what's going on?",
        "Alexandra: Well, isn't it a little bit late for you to be concerned, my dear? I mean, you, the person who started all this big fat mess. Hmm? And how's the morning sickness, by the way?",
        "Olivia: It's gone.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, pity.",
        "Olivia: What's going on? Did they find Alan? Is he all right? Is he...",
        "Alexandra: No, Alan is alive, and he's well. He's resurfaced on his own. No one found him, and he came back with a great big chip on his shoulder, ready to wreak vengeance on all of us for everything we've done to him. Happy? Satisfied? Want to know more?",
        "Lizzie: Grandpa's back? And he's mad at you. Why? What did you do to him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: You're back. Thank... Are you all right?",
        "Alan: Yes, Phillip, I'm just fine, no thanks to you.",
        "Phillip: Where the hell have you been? We've been looking all over for you. Does anybody else know that you're back? Has a doctor seen you yet?",
        "Alan: Would you please just stop with this phony concern of yours, Phillip?",
        "Phillip: What?",
        "Alan: You heard me.",
        "Phillip: Look, I've been worried sick about you. Besides the police, I've got private investigators looking for you all over the state.",
        "Alan: Yes, while you got more and more comfortable in my chair.",
        "Phillip: What is this?",
        "Alan: Your resignation from Spaulding Enterprises, effective immediately.",
        "Phillip: Look, I don't know what's going on with you, but I stepped in and took over the company because we had a crisis here. You had a breakdown.",
        "Alan: Yes, I know all about that.",
        "Phillip: Okay, well, then you know that somebody had to run the company. Alexandra was overwhelmed, so she asked me to do it.",
        "Alan: You and Alexandra planned the whole thing.",
        "Phillip: What?",
        "Alan: You conspired against me with malice. You took away my company, practically my whole my life. Well, you know, it's not going to work, because I am going to take back everything that is mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: So you really didn't know who Richard was till last night?",
        "Jeffrey: No, I really didn't.",
        "Edmund: But you had heard of San Cristobel before?",
        "Jeffrey: San Cristobel, yeah. Beaches, bikinis, cheap rum drinks, right?",
        "Edmund: But you've never actually been there yourself?",
        "Jeffrey: If I wanted to go to a place like that, I think I'd choose Hawaii. No, I really got to go, if you'll excuse me.",
        "Edmund: Hmm. Born in the states, were you?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah.",
        "Edmund: Whereabouts?",
        "Jeffrey: Chicago.",
        "Edmund: Ah, Chicago. Where you raised there?",
        "Jeffrey: I was raised there, yeah, until I went away to school. And then I went to law school, and then I was working for the D.A. in New York, and I had this great little apartment in Tribeca, and every morning I would go to the Four Brothers coffee shop and I'd have a coffee and a bagel.",
        "Edmund: I beg your pardon?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, and just a little bit of sugar in the coffee. I don't like caviar, and I don't like pate. I don't like bubbles in my drink unless it's a cold beer. And the last time I wore a crown, it was Halloween. I was six years old. Is that all the information you need?",
        "Edmund: Yes, I'd say that's already a lot more than I bargained for.",
        "Jeffrey: So I think we're done here.",
        "Edmund: No, Mr. O'Neill, I don't think we are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: And then will read the book back to me-- of course, from memory. But it was still so cute.",
        "Reva: Yeah, that's cute. Now tell me what you were going to tell me about.",
        "Cassie: And R.J. is loving school, and absolutely loving his teacher. Her name is Mrs...",
        "Reva: Edmund.",
        "Cassie: No, her name's not...",
        "Reva: Tell me about Edmund, Cassie. What were you going to tell me? You said at the Beacon that you needed a break from Edmund. What did you mean by that?",
        "Cassie: I was working on getting to that.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, you know, pick up the pace, girl.",
        "Cassie: Well, you know that... Well, these last few weeks, I've spent a lot of time with Edmund.",
        "Reva: Planning the gala.",
        "Cassie: Right.",
        "Reva: Uh-huh.",
        "Cassie: Especially this past week, you know, dealing with all the last-minute details and... You know, it's pretty much been constantly.",
        "Reva: Okay.",
        "Cassie: And it's been pretty emotional. And I guess, you know, I haven't been really paying too much attention. Or I kind of let my guard down, or something.",
        "Reva: Okay. Now, I knew this. I knew you shouldn't have been working that closely with Edmund. I knew something like this was going to happen.",
        "Cassie: You did?",
        "Reva: Yes. He hurt you, didn't he? I can see it in your eyes.",
        "Cassie: No.",
        "Reva: What? Did he take advantage of you? Did he talk you into some little detail about the library in a weak moment, and now you regret it?",
        "Cassie: No, no. It's been nothing like that at all. I mean, Edmund's been great. He's been really great. You know, he's been sensitive and kind and understanding and thoughtful, and out of nowhere, I am like... Drawn to him.",
        "Reva: As a friend? Yes? A friend, Cassie, please.",
        "Cassie: More.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: He's home? Grandpa's home?",
        "Alexandra: Safe and sound.",
        "Olivia: Where was he all this time?",
        "Alexandra: Well, that detail has yet to be unfolded.",
        "Lizzie: Well, at least he's home now, and he's safe. And he's mad at you?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, not really, dear.",
        "Lizzie: Well, that's what you just said. I heard you.",
        "Alexandra: Well, he... That's just a manner of speaking. I mean, he's mad, but he's more mad at the world, you know. He's still in a very disillusioned state right now from this ordeal.",
        "Lizzie: And he wants to wreak vengeance on you? Well, that's what you just said. On both of you?",
        "Alexandra: Well, Lizzie, your grandfather is still a little shaky, you know. He's unfortunately a little paranoid, too. And he seems to have gotten into his head that I perpetrated all kinds of wrongs against him.",
        "Lizzie: What wrongs?",
        "Alexandra: Well, I don't know exactly. He seems to misunderstand all the help I tried to give him over the past few weeks, and think I was trying to harm him. But, you know, I'm sure it's nothing that can't be worked out. We can talk...",
        "Lizzie: I don't believe you. I'm sorry, but I don't. Oh, Aunt Alex, I'm taking the car. I'll send it back for you.",
        "Alexandra: Elizabeth, were are you going?",
        "Lizzie: To see Grandpa-- tell him how happy I am that he's home safe, and find out what's really going on.",
        "Olivia: I'd like to know the answer to that one myself, Alexandra. What exactly did you do to Alan to make you so afraid of him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: Look, Dad...",
        "Alan: Oh, so now we're back to \"Dad.\" I thought you disowned me, Phillip.",
        "Phillip: Look, would you just listen to me for a second, please? I'm trying to explain to you, all right? Now, I don't know what you remember, but you recently had a breakdown, right? And I think you're still a little bit aggravated. I'm not sure you're quite yourself yet.",
        "Alan: No, I didn't have a breakdown.",
        "Phillip: Okay. Well, a judge ruled otherwise.",
        "Alan: Yes, because the judge didn't know about the drugs.",
        "Phillip: Drugs?",
        "Alan: Yes, the drugs that you and Alexandra plied me with to make me paranoid, have hallucinations, so that everyone would think I'd lost my mind so you could sweep in and save the day.",
        "Phillip: What?",
        "Alan: No, it wasn't enough that you took away my wife. You had to take my company, too, Phillip.",
        "Phillip: I have no idea what you're talking about.",
        "Alan: Oh, of course you don't.",
        "Phillip: I don't. I have no... What drugs? What drugs?",
        "Alan: How interesting that you would distance yourself from Alexandra. How pathetically predictable on your part. You know what? It's not going to work, because I have proof. And I am going to take back everything you took from me. Now sign the letter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: I didn't do anything to Alan. You heard what I said to Lizzie. The man's still delusional.",
        "Olivia: About what?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, damned if I know.",
        "Olivia: What is it, Alexandra? Is it because you arranged to have Phillip step in for Alan when he was incapacitated? Does he think you went behind his back or something?",
        "Alexandra: Yes, that's it.",
        "Olivia: Well, he's going to have to face reality, because the court declared him incompetent. We had to take steps to protect the company.",
        "Alexandra: Yes, well, there's a notion that Alan's not going to particularly take to.",
        "Olivia: Well, too bad. It's true. It isn't true?",
        "Alexandra: No. Yes, of course it's true. It's just that Alan's... The state of mind... He's so vindictive. He somehow thinks that I'm responsible for incapacitating him from the very first.",
        "Olivia: Well, that's absurd.",
        "Alexandra: Well, yes, it's absurd.",
        "Olivia: Well, what? He thinks you did something to him physically to cause his meltdown? What?",
        "Alexandra: He's claiming I drugged him.",
        "Olivia: You drugged him?",
        "Alexandra: It's crazy, isn't it?",
        "Olivia: That's wild. That's so wild it could actually be true.",
        "Alexandra: Excuse me?",
        "Olivia: No, it makes sense. I mean, it would explain all his strange behavior, right? You did it. You did it! You actually drugged your brother, and somehow he found out about it.",
        "Alexandra: I never...",
        "Olivia: Alan knows about it. But why are you walking around free, unless... unless there's more. Unless you did something else, something much, much worse, and he's holding it over your head. Well?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: You don't have any proof of anything, Alan.",
        "Alan: Oh, \"Alan.\" So now we're back to \"Alan,\" huh? What happened to \"Dad\"?",
        "Phillip: You don't have any proof because there isn't any, because I didn't do anything to you. I did something for the company. I stepped in and provided leadership, because that was what was required. And I've got to tell you, given the bizarre behavior that I am seeing here today, it's not an authority that I think I'm going to relinquish anytime soon.",
        "Alan: Oh, you will. You will. And you will do it immediately.",
        "Phillip: Really? You think?",
        "Alan: Oh, yes. And if you don't believe me, I suggest you check with your Aunt Alexandra, because I don't think she is too keen on spending the rest of her life in prison.",
        "Phillip: In prison? What is she going to prison for? Oh, for drugging you. Right.",
        "Alan: And stalking Reva Lewis.",
        "Phillip: No. Now, wait a minute. You were the one who stalked Reva Lewis.",
        "Alan: Hmm. That's what you and Alex want everyone to think, but I have proof.",
        "Phillip: You do.",
        "Alan: Yes. But don't worry. I'm not going to run to the police or anything, because I've been judged incompetent to stand trial. No, Phillip, I won't tell anyone what you and Alex did to me unless I don't get my way.",
        "Phillip: Yeah, okay. Well, you know, this has really been fascinating. I'd love to listen to more of it, but I think...",
        "Alan: Don't patronize me.",
        "Phillip: Well, then don't insult me. You really think I'm capable of the things you've just accused me of? You think I'm going to stalk Reva Lewis?",
        "Alan: Yes. In a heartbeat.",
        "Phillip: Really? Okay. Let's say that I did. Then who framed Olivia?",
        "Alan: You did. With her full knowledge, because you were working together.",
        "Phillip: That's...",
        "Alan: That's absolutely true, and you can't deny it.",
        "Phillip: If you believe that, you can go to hell.",
        "Alan: No, you can go to hell, Phillip, because I have found out who is loyal to me-- my son, my real son. Not Alan-Michael-- my eldest biological son. So you, Phillip, can step aside and make for room for Gus Aitoro.",
        "Phillip: I had suspicions.",
        "Alan: Yeah, that was the reason you planned this whole coup, so that he wouldn't get control of the company.",
        "Phillip: So you believe it. You believe...",
        "Alan: Yes, I believe it. And I know it.",
        "Phillip: There's not a doubt in your mind.",
        "Alan: No, not one doubt, because he stood by me when I was at my lowest. He was there for me and nursed me back to health. He understands the meaning of family loyalty-- something you never will.",
        "Phillip: This from the man who faked two heart attacks.",
        "Alan: Yes. And this from the man who stole his own father's wife, and has the audacity to say that she's carrying his child.",
        "Phillip: Leave her out of it.",
        "Alan: Yeah, well, I'd like to leave her out of it. And I'd like if you would have left her alone in the hot tub.",
        "Phillip: Did it ever occur to you, Dad, that maybe the woman just plain does not love you?",
        "Alan: Did it ever occur to you how much I loved you? How much I gave you? I taught you everything that I know, Phillip. I was prepared to make you the most powerful man in America.",
        "Phillip: Because God knows I certainly couldn't accomplish anything on my own.",
        "Alan: But you couldn't wait, could you? No. You took what you wanted, and you left without any respect for me. Well, let me tell you something. You're going to pay, and pay heavily for that choice you made.",
        "Phillip: You know what? I don't know if Alex drugged you. I certainly wouldn't put it past her, or if you just cracked up on your own. But I do know that one way or the other, you have lost your mind, and I don't intend to listen to any more of this.",
        "Alan: Phillip?! Sign it.",
        "Phillip: You want me out of this company, you're going to need a truckload of lawyers. And if you want me out of the family, not even you have enough juice for that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: You did it. You did it, and Alan has proof. And he has proof of something else. Otherwise, you would be in jail right now.",
        "Alexandra: All right. All right. When I saw Alan going downhill so far, I took certain actions, but solely to help Phillip, to protect the company. I would never harm him with any drugs, no. None of this would have happened if you'd had the good sense to keep your damn clothes on instead of lusting after my nephew after you'd married Alan, and then somehow you managed to get yourself knocked up.",
        "Olivia: All the terrible things that you did, Alexandra, were not my fault.",
        "Alexandra: As a matter of fact, they are. You started things rolling that couldn't be undone.",
        "Olivia: You want to talk about rationalizing?",
        "Alexandra: Yes, yes, you were the scourge of this family, if whatever exists... Or what's left of it.",
        "Olivia: Oh, no, sweetheart, that would be you, ever since you got back to town.",
        "Alexandra: And why did I have to come back to town, Olivia?",
        "Olivia: I don't know. Why did you have to come back? We were doing just fine without you.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, yes, you cavorting in a hot tub with my nephew, and Alan feigning heart attacks over the place to keep you. Yes, everything was hunky- dorry in Spaulding land.",
        "Olivia: No, there was problems, but you made things ten times worst with your meddling, which apparently escalated to criminal behavior. Do me a favor. When you need somebody to bail you out, don't call me. Now there's the door. Use it.",
        "Alexandra: If you see Phillip, would you...",
        "Olivia: I will tell him to stay as far away from you as possible. But I think he's catching on to that.",
        "Alexandra: And whose doing is that?",
        "Olivia: You know the biggest irony in all this, Alexandra? Is you claim to do all these hideous things in the name of family. Well, look around. Where is your family? You're all alone. If there's any justice in this world, it'll stay that way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dax: I wish I could have been here for the gala. Everyone said it was a huge success, and certainly these figures bear that out.",
        "Edmund: Yes.",
        "Dax: And you and Cassie got along well?",
        "Edmund: Quite.",
        "Dax: The old animosity is gone then? Or at least diminished?",
        "Edmund: Well, so it would seem.",
        "Dax: Splendid. I'm sure Richard would be happy about that.",
        "Edmund: I hope so. Well, this is fantastic, Dax. It's a very nice order. Thank you very much. And please thanks Prince William for me as well.",
        "Dax: His Highness also asked me to give you this, Edmund. Now that you've raised the money for the library, an appropriate site must be chosen. The building committee feels any of these would be suitable.",
        "Edmund: Mm. Oh, I love this property-- western side of the island, high up on the bluff overlooking Sherman's Bay.",
        "Dax: Ah, yes, that's a beautiful spot. So are these.",
        "Edmund: Hmm.",
        "Dax: You can make a trip to the island soon and look at them yourself, and then advise the committee as to which one you prefer.",
        "Edmund: Research trip to San Cristobel. That's an excellent idea. Speaking of research, Dax, there's something I need you to do for me.",
        "Dax: Of course.",
        "Edmund: I need you to look into a Jeffrey O'Neill. He's the new district attorney here in Springfield.",
        "Dax: O'Neill spelled?",
        "Edmund: N-E-I-L-L. Jeffrey with a \"J.\" Do the usual background check, and then go deeper, Dax. I need to find out everything about this man.",
        "Dax: Is this inquiry official or unofficial?",
        "Edmund: Find a photo of him, Dax. Look at his face. You'll know why I'm interested in him. And while you're doing that, I'm going to pour all my energies into this next phase of the project.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Oh, good Lord. Tell me I did not hear what I just heard.",
        "Cassie: It's not like I planned for this to happen, Reva.",
        "Reva: Oh, that's very reassuring.",
        "Cassie: Listen, I just have been spending so much time with him, you know, going all the details for the library, and then we had to plan the party and come up with the guest list, and plan the menu and then the champagne. And then we had to taste the champagne, and before I knew it, I was being twirled around.",
        "Reva: You were drunk? Tipsy? Whatever. But you certainly were not thinking clearly.",
        "Cassie: I... I may have been a little drunk, maybe with the dancing. But not when he was massaging... My foot, okay? He was massaging my foot. I'm not that far gone.",
        "Reva: He was giving your foot a massage? No big deal. Right?",
        "Cassie: And then he kissed me.",
        "Reva: Edmund Winslow kissed you.",
        "Cassie: Would you rather me lie to you about this?",
        "Reva: I'm at a loss, honey. I believe for the first time in my entire life, I don't have a thing to say, except this: This is the same con man who locked you in a tower.",
        "Cassie: I know. I know. Okay, I know that. And I... I... When I'm with him, I feel like I still have a part of Richard.",
        "Reva: Richard hated Edmund.",
        "Cassie: No, Richard hated the things he did. He did not hate Edmund. And Edmund is trying to become a better person. He is. I've been spending a lot of time with him. And when Richard got up there and spoke those words, I swear for a minute it was like I could hear Richard's voice.",
        "Reva: Wait. Hold it. Do you know what you just said? Did you hear what you just said? You said when Richard got up and spoke. You meant Edmund.",
        "Cassie: No, I... I said that? I said Richard instead of Edmund? Are you sure?",
        "Reva: Uh-huh.",
        "Cassie:: Well, then, that must be it.",
        "Reva: What? What's it?",
        "Cassie: God, that must be it. These feelings that I think that I'm having for Edmund. They're not about him. These are feelings that I still have for Richard. It's like I'm trying to put him into the closest substitute, his brother.",
        "Reva: Well, that sounds possible.",
        "Cassie: Oh, my God. My God. So I'm not really falling for Edmund here?",
        "Reva: I sure as heck hope not.",
        "Cassie: Oh, thank God. Thank God. I mean, this I can handle.",
        "Reva: Yes, you can.",
        "Cassie: Okay, you know what? I'm going to have to get back to the hotel, because I have so much to do. Thank you so much for putting me on track. I'm so glad we had this talk. I'll see you later.",
        "Reva: Yeah. I'm glad we talked, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Grandpa! Oh, thank God you're okay.",
        "Alan: (Laughing) Elizabeth. Oh, you're home. Wait... wait a minute. Aren't you supposed to be in school?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, sure, I'm going to stay at school with you missing and the entire town looking for you? Are you all right?",
        "Alan: Well, yeah, I'm fine.",
        "Lizzie: You sure?",
        "Alan: Yes. (Laughs) I am so... Missed you so much. You look wonderful.",
        "Lizzie: Grandpa...",
        "Alan: What?",
        "Lizzie: I just saw Aunt Alex, and she said some pretty heavy stuff about you.",
        "Alan: Hmm.",
        "Lizzie: Did you guys get in a fight or something?",
        "Alan: Or something, yes.",
        "Lizzie: I'm serious.",
        "Alan: Well, I'm serious, too. Now, let me tell you something. You're going to be hearing things from Aunt Alex and a lot of other people that I want you to shut your ears about. And I want you to also keep it out of your mind.",
        "Lizzie: Because Aunt Alex is terrified that you're furious with her and you're going to do something bad to her.",
        "Alan: Hmm. Could I get you a soda?",
        "Lizzie: You know, it's bad enough I come home to find out my dad's shacked up with Olivia. But then I find out you're missing and crazy, and guilty of stalking Reva on top of it. But then suddenly, here you are home again, and you don't seem crazy at all.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, what you heard... Well, let me just say this. I was troubled for a while, but I am my old self again, in full control of my faculties.",
        "Lizzie: But what... what happened?",
        "Alan: Don't concern yourself with anything. The only thing you need to know is that I am here to put everything right.",
        "Lizzie: What everything?",
        "Alan: Well, the things that were wrong around the house here and the company. I'm going to fix everything. Now, it's not always going to be pretty, but it's going to be necessary.",
        "Lizzie: I don't know if I like the sound of that.",
        "Alan: Well, let me put it this way then. Sometimes people do things with good intentions. They think they're doing the right thing, but they're not, and the truth eventually catches up with them. Well, those people have been doing things for months. It was their turn. And now it's mine.",

        "Bell captain: Ambassador Winslow?",
        "Edmund: Hmm.",
        "Bell captain: I hate to interrupt, but I'm getting off duty. I know you've been working closely with Mrs. Winslow.",
        "Edmund: Yes, yes. What is it?",
        "Bell captain: Mr. O'Neill left a message for your sister-in-law. He wanted to introduce himself to her. He left his room number and the phone number at his office.",
        "Edmund: Oh, yes. Mr. O'Neill mentioned as much to me earlier so... Well, I'll see that Cassie gets the information.",
        "Bell captain: Great. Thanks so much, sir.",
        "Edmund: Thank you.",
        "Cassie: Hi.",
        "Edmund: Hi.",
        "Cassie: Do you have a minute?",
        "Edmund: For you?",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Edmund: A lot longer than that.",
        "Cassie: Okay, can we sit down?",
        "Edmund: Sure.",
        "Cassie: I owe you an apology.",
        "Edmund: An apology? For what?",
        "Cassie: Last night, you know, when we were in the bar and I had that cramp in my foot, and you were nice enough to help me get rid of it, I just kind of jumped up and ran out without even saying thank you.",
        "Edmund: No, actually you said thank you, and then you jumped up and ran out.",
        "Cassie: Well, anyway... Whatever. It was silly. You know, the whole gala and planning the memorial library, it's... You know, it's stirred up a lot of stuff for me.",
        "Edmund: For me, too. Me, too. And I haven't...",
        "Cassie: I haven't been myself. I guess I've been some crazy messed up version of myself. But I want you to know that I'm fine and I'm back on track, and I'm dying to know how we did last night. Have we gotten any kind of numbers from the Embassy?",
        "Edmund: Well, as a matter of fact, Dax just dropped them off. Would you like to see?",
        "Cassie: Love to. Are these for real? We made this much money?",
        "Edmund: Mm-hmm. Disappointed?",
        "Cassie: What do you think?",
        "Edmund: (Laughs)",
        "Cassie: This is amazing. We'll be able to break ground.",
        "Edmund: Yes, we will, which means we can go on to the next very important task, and that's choosing the building site now. Prince William and the building commission have given us a few options. Care to see?",
        "Cassie: Love to. Oh, this is right next to the old sugar cane plantation. Look at this one, on the west side of the island.",
        "Edmund: High up on the bluff, overlooking Sherman's Bay.",
        "Cassie: God, that was one of my favorite places.",
        "Edmund: And mine, too.",
        "Cassie: Well, there are so many beautiful places to choose from. You know, it's going to be hard.",
        "Edmund: Yes, it is. But I don't want to shoulder this task alone. Cassie, I need your input, all right?",
        "Cassie: Absolutely. Yeah, you know, the site is just as important as the building itself, so sure.",
        "Edmund: Good. I'm glad you feel that way, because I'm flying down to San Cristobel to scan out some of the sights, and I'd like you to come with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: I still can't believe this. I mean, did Alexandra actually admit to drugging Alan?",
        "Olivia: No, she didn't admit it. But you said Alan had proof?",
        "Phillip: Oh, he says he has proof. He could be bluffing.",
        "Olivia: No. No, Alexandra wouldn't be this upset unless Alan had something on her.",
        "Phillip: Well, whatever it is, he is determined to make her pay for it-- and me.",
        "Olivia: You didn't do anything wrong.",
        "Phillip: Oh, tell him that. It doesn't make any difference. You know what? God, I'm so sick of trying to reason with him. He wants to see demons in every corner and reap revenge on everyone, fine. I don't give a damn. And that goes for bringing his new son into the fold.",
        "Olivia: Wait a minute. You mean...",
        "Phillip: Yes. Yes, Gus. Alan found out somehow, and he's convinced that it's true.",
        "Olivia: Do you think it's true? Does Alan know this for a fact? Maybe he just wants to believe it.",
        "Phillip: I don't know. It doesn't make any sense. I mean, he's got to figure at some point if he's serious about trying to replace me with Gus, he knows I'm going to challenge him. I can't imagine he's going to go down that road if he can't deliver the goods.",
        "Olivia: Unless he's doing it to spite you or to drive you crazy.",
        "Phillip: No.",
        "Olivia: So what happens? Gus just steps in and takes your place?",
        "Phillip: No, hardly. And you know, you're assuming that he wants my place.",
        "Olivia: Oh, you don't think he does?",
        "Phillip: Gus Aitoro? Does he strike you as a captain of industry? Has he ever shown the slightest interest in what my family does or how we do it?",
        "Olivia: Even Gus' attitude could be changed with a few million dollars dangled in front of him.",
        "Phillip: You know what? I hope. I hope he does. I hope Alan brings him into our happy little family. I'd love to see it. I'd like to take bets on how long he lasts. I hope... I hope Alan does try to play kingmaker with Gus. I want a front row seat so I watch it blow up in his face.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: And Grandpa, I had nothing to do with that fire. I swear. It was these two witchy girls who set it, and they set me up to take the fall. So it's on my school record, and I just don't want it to affect how colleges see my applications.",
        "Alan: Don't you worry about a thing. I'll make a few phone calls and take care of everything for you.",
        "Lizzie: You will?",
        "Alan: Yes, of course. Now, look, I want to talk about this more, but I really must go.",
        "Lizzie: Go? You just got here.",
        "Alan: I understand that. And I want to talk to you some more. But I have a few things I need to attend to.",
        "Lizzie: Things? What things? Business things?",
        "Alan: Well, business and family. You see, someone did me a very big favor, and I am going to pay them back. Bye, sweetheart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You want me to go to San Cristobel with you?",
        "Edmund: Well, you just said you wanted input on the location of the library, so... Oh, Cassie, I'm sorry. This is probably all just too soon, going back to San Cristobel without Richard and with me.",
        "Cassie: With you? What does that mean, like, with you? It's not like we're a couple or anything.",
        "Edmund: Well, no, no. That's not what I meant. It's just... Well, it's one thing to go to an official function with me in the United States. It's another to go back to San Cristobel together. You know how people are.",
        "Cassie: I don't care what people think.",
        "Edmund: Well, if that's not what's bothering you, then what is?",
        "Cassie: My kids. You know, I'm going to have to figure out who's going to take care of the kids and then the hotel. I have to talk to Olivia and find out if, you know, she's available to run the place.",
        "Edmund: We can always postpone the trip.",
        "Cassie: No, no. We don't need to postpone the trip. The sooner the better, right? I'm just going to... I'm going to call Olivia, and I'll figure it out.",
        "Edmund: Great."
