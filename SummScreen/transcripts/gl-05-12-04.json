        "Reva: \"Dearest mom and dad, lunched with Christian La Valle. Loved my sketches-- \"C'est formidable!\" He asked me to dress a certain movie star. I can't really pronounce her name, but I seem to be the hottest ticket in town.",
        "Josh: Whew!",
        "Reva: Love, Marah.\" Oh, wow. Christian La Valle. That is something.",
        "Josh: Wow, that is. That is something. You're right.",
        "Reva: You have no idea who Christian La Valle is, do you?",
        "Josh: Haven't the faintest idea, but he sounds very important, and she sounds happy.",
        "Reva: Oh, is it possible that we could have done something right?",
        "Josh: You know, I'm beginning to think that sending Marah away was one of the best things we've done for her in a long time. Come here, my darling. Mmm.",
        "Reva: Oh...",
        "Shayne: Hey.",
        "Reva: Hi.",
        "Shayne: I hate when I walk in on that mush.",
        "Reva: Oh, there's plenty of mush to go around. Hey, we got a postcard from Marah. She's doing great.",
        "Shayne: Well, that's good news. You guys think you can handle some more news? The role of marina cooper will be recreated by Mandy bureau.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Hey, Marina. Did Shayne call you over, too?",
        "Marina: Something about a huge surprise?",
        "Sandy: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: Wait.",
        "Tammy: What?",
        "Joey: Are you sure you want to...?",
        "Tammy: Yes.",
        "Joey: You didn't hear what I was going to say.",
        "Tammy: Yes. Yes means yes, Joey. Isn't that the magic word that every guy wants to hear? This is so fun.",
        "Joey: That's the idea, isn't it?",
        "Tammy: When my mom and Edmund find out... what? Why did you stop?",
        "Joey: Will you be honest with me about something?",
        "Tammy: Okay.",
        "Joey: Are you doing this to be with me or to get back at your mom?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ed: You know, honey, all of this stuff is, like, for summer school. It's like you're trying to become a doctor in the next six months or something.",
        "Michelle: Well, I've wasted enough time, haven't I?",
        "Ed: Well, I admire your determination, but...",
        "Michelle: But then what's the problem?",
        "Ed: You. It's like you're diving into this, you know? Like it's really about something else.",
        "Michelle: Dad, nobody drowns themselves in chemistry in order to get away from their problems.",
        "Ed: So you don't think you're compensating for all the bad news that's going around about Danny?",
        "Michelle: I'm trying to live up to the family business of saving lives. So act like my mentor and guide me through this stuff.",
        "Ed: All right, look. I wrote a letter here of recommendation for a research assistant position. If you get that, at least it'll save you some bucks.",
        "Michelle: I've got a postmark Africa here. So, are you any closer to making that decision about going?",
        "Ed: Well, I got all the shots I need, just in case.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Nice day, huh? Oh, and this is nice. They have the owner of the hotel out here personally greeting the guests as they arrive.",
        "Cassie: Not now, Jeffrey. Come on.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Your jaw seems a little tighter than usual. What's going on?",
        "Cassie: Tammy skipped school, okay? And I can chalk that up to her newfound love with teenage rebellion, except for the fact that she's with Joey Lupo and I don't know where they are or what they're doing. Edmund's out scouring the town, but you can see that I'm not in the mood for your witty banter, okay?",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Sorry. If you think it's necessary, I can call the department and have them send out every available man to help find her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vinnie: This O'Neill must have reporters on the payroll. There's a puff piece on this guy almost every day.",
        "Danny: I know. He loves for everybody to know who rules this town.",
        "Vinnie: For now.",
        "Danny: He's a publicity hog. He's no threat to us.",
        "Vinnie: Hey, don't tell me my business, Danny, all right?",
        "Danny: All right.",
        "Vinnie: I got a lot of plans for this town. Some of them are going down tonight.",
        "Danny: You know, maybe we should send O'Neill a message; let him know he shouldn't mess with you.",
        "Vinnie: Maybe.",
        "Danny: You know, Vinnie, sometimes the best messages are delivered in person.",
        "Vinnie: Yeah. That's a good idea. Glad I thought of it.",
        "Danny: Let's go.",
        "Vinnie: You make a good lap dog, Danny. You're smart. Just don't get too smart, okay?",

        "Reva: Marina, before I forget, happy birthday.",
        "Josh: Yes. Happy birthday. Is that what this is about?",

        "Shayne: I wanted to wait until everybody that I love is in the same room when it happens. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the new and improved Shayne lewis. I don't need... it's all over. I don't need my cane anymore. I don't need it.",
        "Josh: Whoa, Nelly.",
        "Reva: Oh, my god.",
        "Josh: Nice.",
        "Shayne: I've been running around for weeks in secret. I got the green light from my orthopedic surgeon, my neurologist, my therapist, everybody that you guys have been paying insane amounts of money to. I don't need it.",
        "Josh: Congratulations. Come here.",
        "Sandy: You know what that means, bro? Now I can kick your butt on the basketball court, too.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, well, bring it on. You bring it on.",
        "Josh: Does this mean you're going to be cutting the grass for us this summer?",
        "Shayne: Well, fire up the lawnmower, dad, because I'm back. I'm back. And now you guys can say good- bye.",
        "Reva: What do you mean?",
        "Shayne: I'm moving the rest of my stuff out of the house. The last baby bird is finally leaving the nest! I'm gone. That's it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: We'll be able to talk in here. The dining room's the only private place in the entire house.",
        "Edmund: I have nothing to hide. Lizzie, I've come to ask about Tammy.",
        "Lizzie: Oh. Tammy. Right. We can talk about her. You don't have to pretend with me, though.",
        "Edmund: Pretend?",
        "Lizzie: I know.",
        "Edmund: You know what?",
        "Lizzie: I was there at the cast party. I saw the whole Hollywood lip- lock.",
        "Edmund: Oh, really? No doubt you've spoken to Tammy about this.",
        "Lizzie: Yes, and of course she stuck up for you and said it was all her fault. Whatever. You and I know the real deal. Tammy's a sweet girl so I decided to set her straight on the way things really are.",
        "Edmund: Indeed. Lizzie, where is Tammy?",
        "Lizzie: I don't know. No, I really don't. I figured maybe she stayed home from school.",
        "Edmund: Well, she's not home. Whatever it is you said to her to set her straight, she took to heart because she's run off with Joey.",
        "Tammy: I'm sorry if I made this seem like it was some kind of revenge thing against my mother.",
        "Joey: Tammy, you didn't make it seem like it. It is.",
        "Tammy: No, it's not. I swear. I wanted to be alone with you, that's all. Isn't that what you've been wanting, too?",
        "Joey: Look, Tammy, I'm just a simple guy.",
        "Tammy: I think you're wonderful, Joey.",
        "Joey: I mean, put me in a cabin in the middle of nowhere, a fire in the fireplace, a girl who's just so hot...",
        "Tammy: Just any girl?",
        "Joey: No, not any girl. You. Look, I like you, a lot, and in a situation like this, I more than like you.",
        "Tammy: Then stop trying to be so noble.",
        "Joey: Don't you get it? Tammy, I want to kiss you. I want to touch you. I want you to touch me.",
        "Tammy: Me, too. Me, too.",
        "Joey: But I'm not a prince like your uncle.",
        "Tammy: Forget that. Ugh. You are a million times better than he is. I'm sorry that I ever compared the two of you. I want you, Joey. Just you. You're not kissing me back.",
        "Joey: I know. I can't believe I'm doing this.",
        "Tammy: What, kissing me?",
        "Joey: No, not kissing you. Not touching you. Not trying to get as far as I can with you. Tam, I don't know what's going on with you and your family, but if we're going to be together, I want it to be right.",
        "Tammy: Me, too.",
        "Joey: Come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You would really call out the dogs for me?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, sure. Every last one. But I've got to warn you, they've got guns.",
        "Cassie: I don't think we need to shoot Joey.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, now, don't be too hasty.",
        "Cassie: You know what worries me the most? My worst nightmare? It's imagining Tammy's going to wind up like me when I was her age.",
        "Jeffrey: You know, you seem to have turned out all right.",
        "Cassie: Do you really think I want my daughter to be a teenage mother, swinging from some pole in a strip joint to make a living?",
        "Jeffrey: Look, you've done a great job with her, okay? You've got to trust that. And Edmund's got the bull by the horns. I'm sure he's doing everything he can, or he will do everything he can, to find her.",
        "Cassie: He will, won't he? Right?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, yeah. The man goes after what he wants. So, you know, I'm sure that Tammy is going to come to her senses and she's going to come home. She is.",
        "Cassie: Or she's going to keep making me pay for breaking the trust that she thought we had.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, so this is... this is your fault. You didn't tell me that.",
        "Cassie: It's not.",
        "Jeffrey: It's not?",
        "Cassie: No. I didn't... I did the same thing any mother would do. I did. Wait until you become a parent. Your kid's going to hate you, too.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, there's a rosy picture of parenthood. Thank you.",
        "Cassie: Okay, I take it back. I'm sorry. And I know Tammy doesn't hate me, she's just trying to figure out who she is and she's... (Sighs) ...trying to find her place in this world.",
        "Jeffrey: I do that from time to time.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Me, too.",
        "Jeffrey: This kid never stops, does he?",
        "Cassie: Hey. You keep running away from Ms. Chitwood, don't you?",
        "Jeffrey: All right, he's got that \"how come you look like my daddy?\" Look on his face again.",
        "Cassie: RJ, honey, it's really not polite to stare.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "RJ: Where's my sister?",
        "Jeffrey: Where's your... your what?",
        "RJ: Where's my sister?",
        "Cassie: You want to help me out here, please?",
        "Reva: Oh, honey.",
        "Shayne: Mom, I know you guys are in shock right now, but if you just think about it, I think you guys are going to realize...",
        "Reva: To see our son walk on his own again. Honey, our prayers have been answered.",
        "Shayne: Mom? Me walking, that's cool, but I'm talking about what you guys can do with my room once I'm gone. Did you bring those brochures?",
        "Marina: Now I understand why you wanted me to pick up all these things.",
        "Josh: (Laughs)",
        "Shayne: Home decorating ideas. Okay, look. We could do A... you guys could build a home gym, okay? You could build a solarium. Or this. You could build a home media center, huh? I mean, now that I'm going to be at the museum full- time, I officially give you guys permission to do whatever you'd like with my room.",
        "Josh: That's so thoughtful of you, son. Are you going to pay for all this?",
        "Shayne: No, because it's your house. Take it as it is. (Laughter)",
        "Sandy: You know, the gym is pretty sweet.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, but like they'd use it. I say they build a solarium. Or they could build a new sauna.",
        "Sandy: Oh, swedish dry heat with red wood paneling, throw a jacuzzi in there, some candlelight. Hm?",
        "Shayne: I don't need that image. These are parents.",
        "Reva: I like the sound of the jacuzzi.",
        "Josh: Me, too.",
        "Marina: He's right. Think of us as \"young eyes for the old guys.\" My advice, Reva? Take control now and turn it into your own personal study. Josh has to knock whenever he wants to come in.",
        "Shayne: No, not so much, dad. Build it, make a home entertainment studio, okay? Look, you can do HDTV, plasma big screen, all right? You can do floor to ceiling speakers, a DVD changer and those two big easy chairs, get two of those right next to each other.",
        "Sandy: Movie night would definitely kick lame games night butt.",
        "Reva: Wait a minute. What's up with the lame game night?",
        "Sandy: I meant lame in the best possible way.",
        "Shayne: People, I think our job is done here.",
        "Sandy: Yeah.",
        "Marina: Yeah.",
        "Shayne: Yeah.",
        "Sandy: Yeah. Time to do some real celebrating.",
        "Shayne: Time to go.",
        "Josh: Because I think you should all leave now.",
        "Sandy: I'm buying.",
        "Josh: Not that we don't love you.",
        "Shayne: Bye.",
        "Marina: Bye.",
        "Sandy: Bye.",
        "Reva: Your son can walk on his own.",
        "Josh: I guess that means I can breathe again.",
        "Cassie: RJ, honey, Tammy's going to be back real soon.",
        "RJ: When?",
        "Bellboy: Mrs. Winslow? Mrs. Santos is here. She asked if you had a moment.",
        "Cassie: Oh, okay. I'll be right back, sweetie.",
        "Jeffrey: Wait. Wait. Mrs. Winslow. No... oh. (Sighs) don't... all right, fine. Your mom wants to leave you here, hm? I suppose she expects me to take care of you, read you a book or something. Fine. I'm going to read you a book. Here's one right here that I was going to read anyway. It's the Springfield criminal code, huh? I'm working on a little case called \"sanders vs. Sanders\" that ought to put you right to sleep. See, the precedent for the case... all right, let's try this. Once upon a time, there was a man named sanders and there was a woman named Gillespie. And they fell in love and they got married and then they broke up.",
        "RJ: Why?",
        "Jeffrey: Why? Well, you see, the thing is, sometimes, RJ, men and women... well, especially women... okay, well, because there was an evil wizard that cast a spell on them that made them hate each other. That's why.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Look, if I knew where Tammy and Joey were, I would tell you.",
        "Edmund: And why should I believe that?",
        "Lizzie: Because it's the truth.",
        "Edmund: How do you feel about Joey, Lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: He... he's okay. I mean, he does that whole Eddie Haskell thing with parents, but he's cool.",
        "Edmund: I'm sorry; I'm not familiar with the reference.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, he sucks up to parents and old people like you. But of course, he does have a reputation.",
        "Edmund: Reputation for what?",
        "Lizzie: Joey has been with a lot of girls, and he talks about it to everyone. (Cell phone rings)",
        "Edmund: Yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Where are you?",
        "Edmund: Fact-finding. Any word?",
        "Cassie: I just saw Michelle and she told me that Tammy asked for the keys to the Bauer cabin. Edmund, that's all the way up on highway 20. If Joey's with her...",
        "Edmund: Right. I'm on my way. Call me in ten minutes with better directions.",
        "Lizzie: Wait. Wherever you're going, can I come with you? Maybe I can keep you from killing Joey.",
        "Edmund: I'll try to control myself.",
        "Lizzie: But please... oh, Joey, what has she gotten you into this time?",
        "Cassie: Come on, Tammy, pick up the phone. Please pick up the phone. (Phone ringing)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: I hope I didn't get Tammy in trouble.",
        "Ed: Oh, yeah. To be a teenager in trouble again.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, the good old days. So give me some information about going to Africa.",
        "Ed: I don't really know that I'm going yet.",
        "Michelle: Well, just... why don't you tell me about it anyway?",
        "Ed: All the children in the area that I would be assigned to, none of them have been immunized. They don't have any medication for sleeping sickness. You know, there's an epidemic that's just ravaging the countryside, so...",
        "Michelle: Sounds like the medical staff must be overwhelmed.",
        "Ed: It's not really a staff. I mean, it's two old doctors and a nurse.",
        "Michelle: They need you.",
        "Ed: I could be of use, yeah. But I could also be of use here, with my family. I mean, especially now that Danny's...",
        "Michelle: Don't bring Danny into this.",
        "Ed: Well, it's hard not to, honey.",
        "Michelle: It was a political defeat. It's not a life-threatening illness. We will survive.",
        "Ed: Of course you will survive. I know that. I mean, it's just that I would like to be part of that, you know? With Robbie and with Rick and Mel and the new baby. Anyway, I promised I'd help get you through med school, you know, so you can't get rid of me that easily. Now, listen, if you want to know the key to organic chemistry, it's in how you organize your original inquiry.",
        "Danny: Do you really think you can do this? I know how much your family means to you.",
        "Michelle: That's why we have to shut them out. It's for their sake. Dad, we've been going back and forth with this, and I'm just going to come out and say it: I want you to go to Africa. We're not going to leave this table until you agree.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: The people were watching him and he said, \"No, no!\" The wizard said, \"If I can't be happy, then no one can be happy!\" When the charming prince of a lawyer picked up the scales of justice and he hurled them at the wizard, like a boomerang, and it went... (makes whooshing noises)...and it hit the wizard right in the head and he fell down and everybody leaped and shouted, and they were all happy and they were all going to live happily ever after. That is, once the handsome lawyer got paid his 850 billable dollars per hour. The end.",
        "RJ: Again!",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, no, no. No, RJ, not again. Please. Do you know what? Here. Take your picture. George at the front desk told me that he wanted to buy you an ice cream cone. And there he is. George, buy him an ice cream! Go get him, RJ.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vinnie: Counselor. My friend Danny said you and I should clear the air.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh. Well, that would require that you stop polluting the air, Vinnie, by opening your mouth.",
        "Vinnie: You want to play like that, O'Neill? There's always plan B. But I don't think you're going to like what that means to you.",
        "Jeffrey: You know, you should pay more attention to the company you keep, Danny. At the very least, you used to be known as a well-mannered criminal.",
        "Danny: Yeah? What makes you any different, O'Neill?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, a higher IQ than both of you combined, for starters.",
        "Danny: That's funny, coming from a liar and a cheat who hides behind the law to run this town.",
        "Vinnie: Hey. Hey, hey, hey. I came here as a courtesy, O'Neill, to let you know that I'm here now. Putting down roots.",
        "Jeffrey: Roots? Interesting choice of words. More like tentacles, I'd say. Hey, Vinnie? You already got one wrapped around Danny-boy's neck. How does that feel, Danny? Hm? And to think that this guy used to answer to you and your family.",
        "Danny: Actually, he's my family now.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, well, that's touching. That really is. Well, I guess people get what they deserve. And I guess you deserve to be at the end of someone's leash.",
        "Vinnie: Hey.",
        "RJ: Jeffrey, Jeffrey. Come in for ice cream.",
        "Vinnie: Who's this? How you doing? My name's Vinnie. What's your name?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Tammy! Joey! Well, that's good to know. Oh, my God. Tammy?",
        "Shayne: Hey. This is where you take me to celebrate, huh? You take me to the mall.",
        "Sandy: Well, where else can you get dinner for three from ten different countries for under $20, because that's all I got.",
        "Marina: I'll buy the sodas. Would you slow down?",
        "Sandy: Whoa, there, hot rod. You'll be running a 44-40 in no time.",
        "Shayne: 4.3. And then I'm going to do a 10k, and then I'm going to hit up a marathon, and then I'm going to do an ultra-marathon. How about that? First, I'm going to stand here with my beautiful girl and hug her and love her, and then take in the sights and sounds and smells of this mall.",
        "Sandy: An ultra-marathon?",
        "Shayne: Okay. All right. We could do some snowboarding out west. We could do some cliff-diving in Mexico.",
        "Marina: Shayne, take it easy.",
        "Shayne: We can do dancing in panama for spring break.",
        "Sandy: Nice.",
        "Shayne: And something simple: Kicking a football.",
        "Sandy: How about kicking somebody's butt?",
        "Marina: (Laughs) riding a bike. Riding a horse.",
        "Shayne: Running through this mall completely naked.",
        "Sandy: Marina goes first. Whoa, hold that thought. Hold that thought. Look at this, over here. Huh? Huh?",
        "Marina: It's a sign.",
        "Sandy: You know what to do with this?",
        "Shayne: You know what time it is?",
        "Sandy: What time?",
        "Shayne: It's time to play ball.",
        "Sandy: Oh. Well, I don't know how to play ball, but...",
        "Shayne: Well, that's okay, brother, because you taught me how to play poker and I'm going to teach you how to play some baseball. You're going to catch, baby?",
        "Marina: I'm ready.",
        "Shayne: Okay. You ready?",
        "Marina: Uh-oh.",
        "Guard: Do you kids work here?",
        "Shayne: Um, no. We were actually just...",
        "Marina: Sir, do you know who this is? Shayne lewis. He was a top draft pick of the cubs last year.",
        "Shayne: Marina, it's okay...",
        "Guard: Yeah. Yeah, I do know you. Hey, just glad to see you back on your feet.",
        "Shayne: Thanks, man.",
        "Marina: (Laughs)",
        "Shayne: Did I ever thank you guys? I don't think I've ever had so much fun in my life.",
        "Marina: Just seeing you like this is the \"thank you\" I've been waiting for.",
        "Sandy: I love you guys.",
        "Shayne: Oh, you want a group hug? Is that what this is?",
        "Sandy: Give me one. Give me one.",
        "Marina: Hey, guys?",
        "Shayne: Mm-hmm?",
        "Sandy: Yeah?",
        "Marina: Race you to the food court.",

        "Reva: Here you go.",
        "Josh: Our son can walk again. Even more than that. Did you see that? He threw his cane aside. He laughed. He was jumping up and down. I mean, to see him move like that. It feels like some kind of forgiveness. I just... I mean, I always wanted him to walk again, you know? But not for me.",
        "Reva: I know.",
        "Josh: It was for him. For him.",
        "Reva: We haven't had a day this big and wonderful in a long time.",
        "Josh: Thank you for loving me. For still loving me.",
        "Reva: I wouldn't know how not to. You know, I know you've been holding in so much for such a long time. You need to let it go. Shayne would want you to.",
        "Josh: I think I was so excited and so surprised that I forgot to tell him how proud I am of him.",
        "Reva: I think he knows. You know what else he knew? How to make an exit. Do you realize what just happened? We have officially become empty- nesters. Not only has our son given us his blessing, but he's also given us interior design ideas for his own room. So, what are we going to do now? (Doorbell rings) we've got to get that.",
        "Josh: I'll get it.",
        "Reva: Quick. Hurry.",
        "Josh: I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. Joey?",
        "Joey: Hi.",
        "Josh: Hi, how are you?",

        "Joey: Come here.",
        "Reva: Hi, Tammy.",
        "Josh: Hello.",
        "Tammy: Aunt Reva. Uncle Josh. You wouldn't happen to have a spare room for me, would you?",
        "Tammy: I shouldn't have come here. We could have just stayed where we were.",
        "Joey: I'm not the one saying that. But where we were was pretty nice for a guy, if you know what I'm saying?",
        "Tammy: Joey.",
        "Reva: Can we assume that this has something to do with what's been going on with you and Edmund and your mom?",
        "Tammy: Yes. Yes.",
        "Reva: Okay, at least you're not locked in your room any longer. That's progress.",
        "Tammy: I didn't just leave my room. I'm leaving my mom's hotel for good.",
        "Josh: You ran away?",
        "Tammy: How could I run away when I'm here? You can't run away to your family, right?",
        "Josh: So, do you have a plan?",
        "Tammy: I thought I was going away to be with someone that I care about.",
        "Joey: Tammy, Edmund's the prince of a country, okay? He would have had the entire cabin surrounded by an army before I got to second base.",
        "Tammy: Joey, stop it.",
        "Reva: So, your mother has no idea where you are, is that what you're saying? She must be worried sick.",
        "Tammy: Okay, before you call the mommy police, could you at least listen to my side?",
        "Reva: Tammy, your mom doesn't have an idea where you are. How could you possibly think there are sides in any of this?",
        "Josh: She has a right to know that you're okay, that you're safe.",
        "Tammy: Okay, we'll call.",
        "Josh: Joey, come here. Come outside with me for a little bit. We'll be outside. (Telephone rings)",

        "Cassie: Thank god she's all right.",
        "Reva: Yeah, she's fine. And Joey's here, too. Tammy said she wanted to talk to me. What do you think?",
        "Cassie: I'm just grateful that she wants to talk to anyone. Please, talk to her. And call me back as soon as you can.",
        "Reva: Okay, I'll do my best. Okay, young lady. What's the story?",
        "Tammy: Um...",
        "Reva: And don't hold back a thing. Nothing you could possibly say would surprise me.",

        "Michelle: While you were gone, I missed you. I did. I missed having a dad.",
        "Ed: Of course you did, honey. That's why it's hard thinking about leaving again.",
        "Michelle: We both know you have to.",
        "Ed: Not necessarily.",
        "Michelle: The children there need you, dad. You have to go where you're needed.",
        "Ed: Then tell me why.",
        "Michelle: Because we're going to survive. Can you say the same thing about the lives you might be saving in Africa? Because that's what you're doing, you know? You're saving the world a little piece at a time. And when you need a break, we're going to be here waiting for you.",
        "Ed: I don't know what kind of a doctor you're going to make, but you're a wonderful daughter, Michelle.",

        "Vinnie: Hey, what for? Come on. I love kids. Listen, this doesn't have to be complicated, okay? My message is simple: Don't make trouble for me, and I might not make trouble for you.",
        "Jeffrey: Vinnie, you want to settle in this little town of ours, that's fine. I can't stop you.",
        "Vinnie: No, you can't.",
        "Jeffrey: But I will tell you this: If my office hears of any accidents, like, you know, someone choking on a fish bone or someone breaking a kneecap because they fell off a curb, I'm coming for you. And you, well, I think it's nice that Vinnie has a new friend, but what he's really going to need is an alibi. Come on, son.",
        "Vinnie: I offer him my hand and he spits on my shoes.",
        "Danny: I think you make him nervous, Vinnie.",
        "Vinnie: Of course I do. I've got a lot of plans for this town. And they start tonight.",

        "Marina: Your brother is so weird.",
        "Sandy: Yeah, he's a weirdo. But in a good way.",
        "Marina: We get all the way to the food court and he sends us to wait here so he can pick out our food and surprise us.",
        "Sandy: See, I told you this was going to be an exciting outing.",
        "Marina: It's a big day. I remember a lot of days when Shayne thought he'd never get out of bed again, much less run around a mall picking out junk food for a picnic.",
        "Sandy: You know, he got out of bed because you wouldn't let him stay there, so it's a big victory for you, too.",
        "Marina: You are giving me way too much credit.",
        "Sandy: No, I'm not. Think about it. And it's pretty cool seeing you guys come full circle. Everything is great again, almost as if nothing has changed.",
        "Marina: And yet everything has. Everything has changed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Tammy, honey, I know that you're having a difficult time, but it sounds to me like you may be punishing your mom for reading your journal.",
        "Tammy: You say that like it's a bad thing. She had no right.",
        "Reva: Sweetheart, with a mother's law, there is no clear cut when it comes to an issue like this. You push us up against the wall; we have the right to do pretty much what we want.",
        "Tammy: Like I backed her into a corner? I'm the one who got shafted.",
        "Reva: I don't think your mother would have just opened your journal and read it unless she had pretty good reason. Like maybe she thought you were keeping secrets.",
        "Tammy: Well, so what if I do have some secrets? I don't do drugs. I get good grades. I'm doing the best I can, Aunt Reva.",
        "Reva: And so is your mother. She's doing the best she can. Maybe she overreacted...",
        "Tammy: Maybe?",
        "Reva: Maybe. Maybe not.",
        "Tammy: Well, what would you have done if this happened between you and Marah?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: What would you have done, Mr. Lewis? You're in a cabin in the middle of nowhere, complete privacy, with the girl of your dreams.",
        "Josh: Joey, you did the right thing.",
        "Joey: I don't feel like I did.",
        "Josh: (Laughs) well, that's because there's a difference between doing the right thing and doing what you want to do, sometimes. Look, I'm sorry. The best I can offer you right now is a pat on the back from an understanding guy. And now you get to go home and take a cold shower.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: You know, Tammy, before I was a mother, I was a lot like you.",
        "Tammy: You got in a lot more trouble than me. But that's the thing. It was okay for you to rebel, because after a while everyone just started to expect it.",
        "Reva: I was a free spirit.",
        "Tammy: Well, I am just the opposite, okay? Sweet, innocent Tammy.",
        "Reva: I had my sweet moments, too.",
        "Tammy: You didn't have to live a whole lifetime full of them.",
        "Reva: Okay, sweetheart. Who said you had to make a choice between playing with dolls and playing with fire? You can't see any of this from your mom's point of view?",
        "Tammy: I'll tell you what her point of view is, okay? \"Tammy, stay nice and innocent and cute. You mean you're alive under there, Tammy? You actually have feelings? No, no, no. Quit that.\"",
        "Reva: I don't think you're giving your mother enough credit.",
        "Tammy: You want us to make up. Wouldn't everyone benefit from a little bit of space? Please let me stay with you and uncle josh for a little while. You have room.",
        "Reva: At least we did.",
        "Tammy: I could even stay in the pool house. I'll clean the pool for you.",
        "Reva: (Laughs)",
        "Tammy: I'll take out the garbage, feed the cat.",
        "Reva: I don't have a cat.",

        "Reva: Yeah, well, that's good because you'll probably be seeing a lot more of him.",

        "Edmund: Well, Cassie, far be it from me to suggest anything. Um, this episode with Tammy...",
        "Cassie: I know. She's acting out. But you know what? In the end, it's harmless.",
        "Edmund: I don't know if it necessarily was.",
        "Cassie: Why? Did something happen?",
        "Edmund: Well, the road was being paved, I think, in that direction, with blankets strewn across the floor and a roaring fire and wine glasses filled with gourmet soda pop. Cassie, I'll let you know the details when I see you again, but I think you get the picture. Actions have consequences, Cassie. I think Tammy needs to understand that.",
        "Cassie: Drive safe.",

        "Vinnie: Oh, is this girl a keeper or what? Listen, you're going to find once you get to know me that I think family is very important. I'll tell you what. Don't even look at the kitchen. Why don't you two go grab some good Italian, a nice bottle of vino and have a great night on the town.",
