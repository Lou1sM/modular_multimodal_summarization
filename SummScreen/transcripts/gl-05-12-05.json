        "Tammy: I didn't realize I had such stiff competition.",
        "Sandy: She's looking good for her age. You know, she makes a mean cookie. She doesn't even use chocolate chips. She breaks bars...",
        "Tammy: I've been wanting to do that all day.",
        "Dinah: Oh, man. Okay, I need a shower.",
        "Jeffrey: All right, I'm going to call the state department and see if my friends found out about alonzo.",

        "Edmund: I put in calls, cassie. I should hear back shortly.",
        "Cassie: He's just trying to avoid us. Why is alonzo doing this? Why doesn't he trust me anymore?",
        "Edmund: Alonzo's under a lot of pressure. Cassie, you know that as well as I do.",
        "Cassie: I don't care. You know, I don't care. I know that will loves alonzo, and I know he loves going to san cristobel, but I'm the only mother he's ever known, edmund.",

        "Tammy: Sorry. I'm kind of surprised you even want to see me after I left you last night.",

        "Josh: That's good. Because actually I wasn't 100% sure what we've been fighting about anyway.",
        "Reva: Well, that would be my fault.",
        "Josh: No, I'm not pointing any fingers or anything. I'm just saying that for me it's better when we fight if we do... do it about something more specific.",
        "Jonathan: Like me?",
        "Josh: Yes, exactly. So what have we been fighting about?",
        "Reva: I don't know.",
        "Josh: That's not really encouraging, reva.",
        "Reva: I'm just going through something, you know. And it has nothing to do with you.",
        "Josh: If something affects you, it affects me.",
        "Reva: Not always. I mean, there are some things that I have to work out on my own.",
        "Jonathan: She's an independent woman, joshua.",
        "Josh: I know! Okay? Sorry.",
        "Reva: I'm sorry if I've been making your life miserable lately.",
        "Josh: No, really I can handle it. I mean, I knew I was signing on for a roller coaster when I said \"I do\" three times.",
        "Jonathan: You must be kind of woozy by now.",
        "Reva: You know what? Somebody's going to be feeling woozy.",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) you said I could stay.",
        "Reva: There was a reason for that, and the reason is I'm going to really steal the boss away. So what do you say? Come with me.",
        "Josh: I can'T. I have a business meeting.",
        "Reva: Oh. Oh, all right.",
        "Josh: Another time?",
        "Reva: Sure.",
        "Josh: Jonathan, I need you to hold down the fort while I'm away at this business meeting. Take messages. Don't touch anything.",
        "Jonathan: Aye-aye, captain.",
        "Josh: All right. I'll see you later, okay?",
        "Reva: Okay.",
        "Josh: Wait up for me.",
        "Jonathan: So, that went well.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs )",
        "Jonathan: ( Moans and laughs )",
        "Reva: Why don't you come with me?",
        "Jonathan: Oh, you're a bad... you're a bad influence on me. You just heard him say I have to stay here and hold the fort down.",
        "Reva: So what are you doing? Going for employee of the month or something? I'm not going to rat you out. Come on.",
        "Jonathan: No, I didn't take this job to mess it up. Hey, what's wrong with you?",
        "Reva: Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, come on. Stay here. We can collate!",
        "Reva: No.",
        "Jeffrey: No, no, no. I got it. Just let me know if you hear anything else. Okay, thanks.",
        "Edmund: Still nothing?",
        "Jeffrey: All we know is that alonzo's flight was delayed because of the storm.",
        "Edmund: Oh. Well done.",
        "Jeffrey: How about you, mr. Ambassador? How are your connections working out?",
        "Edmund: Excellent.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. Well, why don't we just try to get some shuteye, okay.",
        "Edmund: Fine by me.",
        "Jeffrey: You take the bed, I'll sleep in the chair.",
        "Edmund: Oh, no, you're not going to blame your stiff neck in the morning on me. You take the bed. I'll take the chair.",
        "Jeffrey: You just love playing the martyr, don't you?",
        "Edmund: Isn't that what you're doing?",
        "Jeffrey: You know what? It's a big bed. We'll share.",
        "Edmund: You have got to be joking.",
        "Jeffrey: What side do you want?",
        "Edmund: I don't care.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, fine. I'll take the left.",
        "Edmund: That's my side.",
        "Jeffrey: I thought you said you didn't care.",
        "Edmund: I don'T. Take whatever side you want, mr. O'neill.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. I'm going to take the left.",
        "Dinah: Do you know what's going on out there, little one? Why do things get so messy with adults? Look, I know it seems lonely even with all these people around us, but it's not going to be that way forever. Things are going to work out for us. I know they are.",
        "Tammy: Hey.",
        "Jonathan: Don't say it.",
        "Tammy: What, that you clean- up good? I won'T.",
        "Jonathan: I thought you were going to take a cheap shot at the suit.",
        "Tammy: No. It actually makes you look like you belong.",
        "Jonathan: Well, looks can be deceiving. And it's actually one of joshua'S.",
        "Tammy: You borrowed a suit from josh, mr. Trust fund baby?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, well, what's the point of spending good money on new clothes if I don't know if this gig will last?",
        "Tammy: Well, you haven't been fired yet. You must be doing okay.",
        "Jonathan: Whatever.",
        "Tammy: Admit it. You're having fun and you're doing a good job. It's cool.",

        "Tammy: Surprise. Remember that summer job I told you about? It's here, at lewis.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, we can all do lunch.",

        "Sandy: I won't be long.",
        "Jonathan: So little tammy got a job in the big city? Wow. Why didn't you say anything about it last night?",
        "Tammy: I don't know. I guess I didn't think it mattered.",
        "Jonathan: How do you think old sandy feels about you and i working so closely together?",
        "Tammy: Sandy's not threatened by me helping you, jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: He's not?",
        "Tammy: No. Sandy's the kind of guy that would give you the shirt off his back if you needed it.",
        "Jonathan: Me?",
        "Tammy: Although on second thought I guess you already would have borrowed it.",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs sarchastically ) we're not the same size.",

        "Blake: So, josh, are you on board 100%?",
        "Josh: Yes, absolutely.",
        "Blake: Because usually you're a little cautious; you look before you leap.",
        "Josh: I looked.",
        "Sebastian: It's not that i don't trust you, joshua, buy my sister and I, we know why we're onboard.",
        "Blake: It's our legacy.",
        "Sebastian: Yeah, our father's unfinished business.",

        "Reva: ( Laughs ) don't flatter yourself.",
        "Nate: I'm not. It's just some people don't appreciate my signature drink. I guess it's an acquired taste.",
        "Reva: So am I.",
        "Nate: ( Laughs )",
        "Jeffrey: I can't handle this. Where are you going?",
        "Dinah: Prenatal vitamins. I forgot them in the bag. What about you?",

        "Jonathan: Well, I didn't want to come in here today and look like a complete idiot.",

        "Nate: I didn't teach bob the secret. It's all in the hips.",

        "Nate: You were a natural behind the bar.",
        "Reva: Well, that's because I've spent so much time in front of it. Or on top of it.",
        "Nate: No.",
        "Reva: You doubt me?",

        "Blake: I know she was.",
        "Josh: The point is, alan had no reason whatsoever to fire her.",
        "Sebastian: Don't be naive, josh. Alan had a reason.",
        "Josh: Yeah, because reva supported harley during her trial.",
        "Sebastian: I also heard through the grapevine that she took on phillip, head to head.",
        "Josh: Yes, she did that. It's her job. She's a journalist, she's not a puppet, and nobody knows that better than alan spaulding.",
        "Blake: Which is why alan fired her.",
        "Josh: Yeah. Yeah. He just threw her away like some old shoe.",
        "Sebastian: An expensive old shoe. I saw her contract.",
        "Sandy: She was worth it. She made a lot of money for that station.",
        "Sebastian: Hm. Yeah. You're right. Well, is this all you want?",
        "Josh: Oh, no, actually I want to kick alan where it hurts. Wspr, that's just a little appetizer.",
