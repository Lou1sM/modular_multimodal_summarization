        "Dinah sneaks up on Alan-Michael in San Gabriel. He says he left Springfield because of the corporate roller coaster and Marina. He also insists that his deal with her is still on. Dinah pulls out Mallet's gun and threatens Alan Michael. She accuses Alan-Michael of having something to do with Ross's death and tells him she's heard that he might have been the last person to see Ross alive. Alan Michael is truly afraid of Dinah and thinks she is going to kill him and he pleads for his life. Meanwhile, Mallet, Gus and Harley arrive in San Gabriel to find Dinah. The group separates, and Harley and Gus go to a hotel looking for Dinah and inadvertently find out that Ross has a suite there and they are able to talk their way into it. Harley pretends to be Blake. Once inside they find Ross's private eyes' business card and phone her lesbian lover, Kelsey who says she has evidence they can use. She faxes them a photo and Harley sees it and says she thinks she knows why Ross was killed. Mallet is able to bribe a local photographer who points him in Dinah's' direction. He finds Dinah alone, on the Cliffside terrace and wants her to admit what she did. Dinah says he will never want her if he knows what she did. Billy tells Cassie he doesn't think that Josh and Reva will last. Cassie says that it's wishful thinking. Cassie warns Billy to stay out of their relationship. Reva is visibly in pain but doesn't let on to Josh. She eventually lies to Josh saying she's going to do research with Dr McCabe and leaves the fundraiser with her doctor. Mel learns she can't go on the romantic vacation Rick has planned because she's been scheduled to work at the hospital. She tells him to go on without her."

        "Cassie: Not a good idea. And when you come back, get the model of the hospital display table. The last thing we need is the press spilling punch all over the east wing. Thank you.",
        "Billy: I like the way you take charge.",
        "Cassie: Hi. Somebody has to do it. It's H.B.'s dream on the line.",
        "Billy: And we're going to do him proud.",
        "Cassie: I hope so. And I think it's great that Josh and Reva have this project to work on.",
        "Billy: Yeah. How's that going?",
        "Cassie: Josh and Reva?",
        "Billy: Yeah.",

        "Reva: I'm calling about an appointment for tomorrow. Reva Lewis, yes Dr. McCabe recommended a series of radiation treatments. A few weeks? Well, you have my files there, right? Okay, then, I'll see you tomorrow.",
        "Josh: So who's that?",
        "Reva: Ah, my boyfriend.",
        "Josh: Oh, I hope you told him that we're back together.",
        "Reva: He's having a very hard time.",
        "Josh: Oh, well, I certainly can't blame him.",
        "Reva: Did you eat some of my fries?",
        "Josh: Maybe.",
        "Reva: You can have it all?",
        "Josh: What, you're not hungry?",
        "Reva: Actually, I'm just-- there's going to be a lot of food at the reception, and I'm saving myself.",
        "Josh: I see. Suit yourself. Mm.",
        "Reva: ( Laughing )",
        "Josh: I can't believe it. I can't face reporters with mustard on my tie.",
        "Reva: Well, you know-- not to worry.",
        "Josh: You carry a-- never mind. This is very wifey of you.",
        "Reva: Well, yes, hopefully I'll get it right this time.",
        "Josh: I don't know what I would do without you, Reva.",
        "Reva: Well, hopefully, you'll never have to find that out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: It's a small island. So I think if we split up, we can cover all of the hotels in a matter of hours.",
        "Harley: What if Dinah goes straight to the Spaulding house?",
        "Gus: What would be the point of her getting a hotel and if she's just going to stop off and whack somebody?",
        "Mallet: She's not going to whack Alan-Michael. She's not going to whack anyone else either. She's just coming down for answers and she deserves that.",
        "Gus: Really? And if Alan-Michael did have something to with her father's death, you think she's just going to forgive and forget?",
        "Mallet: No, but I think there's middle ground between forgive and forget and... pulling the trigger.",
        "Gus: Who said anything about a gun?",
        "Harley: Hey, where's your service revolver?",
        "Gus: She took it?",
        "Mallet: She took it for protection.",
        "Gus: When were you going to tell us this?",
        "Mallet: Well, what? What would have you done differently?",
        "Gus: For starters, I would have told Alan-Michael he should be wearing a bullet-proof vest.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: What the hell was that for?",
        "Dinah: It's just me saying hello.",
        "Alan-Michael: Let me just guess, you didn't just happen to be in the neighborhood.",
        "Dinah: No, I flew all the way out here to see you. We have some unfinished business, my friend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: I never should have let her out of my sight. If something happens, man...",
        "Harley: Nothing is going to happen. Nothing will happen. We'll find her before she hurts herself or anybody else for that matter. We found him, right? We thought that was impossible.",
        "Mallet: That was Alan-Michael. Mallet: She's not going to whack Alan-Michael.",
        "Harley: You two stop.",
        "Mallet: I'm not going to stop until you all realize if Alan-Michael brought down Ross' plane, we have no idea, we have no idea how dangerous he really is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: You don't seem too happy to see me.",
        "Alan-Michael: No. What the hell is in that thing? I'm just surprised; you're a long way from home.",
        "Dinah: So are you, Andrew Mark Spencer. I took a drive by the old Spaulding vacation home and when I saw that you weren't there, I decided to nosey around for a while. F.Y.I., never ever when you're trying to hide, use your initials when you wan to hide.",
        "Alan-Michael: I just wanted to relax, be alone for a little while.",
        "Dinah: Really? Since when did the future CEO of Spaulding Enterprises have time to relax? Wrong idea, Alan-Michael.",
        "Alan-Michael: You here to talk shop?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I'm a little nervous about our momentum dropping. You know, I mean, we were just moments away from busting in you know Harley on this whole Gus/photo thing, and you decided to slip away, you little rascal.",
        "Alan-Michael: I didn't bail out, I just...",
        "Dinah: Was I too much for you?",
        "Alan-Michael: No, it wasn't you, Dinah. It was Marina, and the whole corporate roller coaster. I wanted off.",
        "Dinah: Oh, I understand.",
        "Alan-Michael: But our plan is still good.",
        "Dinah: Good, I am very glad to hear that. I had trouble getting on that plane, though. I don't like flying so much. Now after, especially after what happened to my father.",
        "Alan-Michael: Yeah, I always loved flying, but I guess it would be tough after just having lost somebody.",
        "Dinah: I loved him more than anybody in the whole entire world.",
        "Alan-Michael: I know. I'm so sorry.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I don't feel very safe right now. Now that he is gone. You know what I mean.",
        "Alan-Michael: I can only imagine.",
        "Dinah: Hey, imagine this: You know, after daddy's plane went down, Mallet tracked down the mechanic that was working on the plane, and guess what happened? He shot Mallet. First my dad and then, Mallet. So you can understand why I really don't feel safe these days.",
        "Alan-Michael: I guess you can't be too careful these days.",
        "Dinah: No, you guessed right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mel: I can't believe it. You want to stop on the way to an event that is bound to have a lot of food.",
        "Rick: Honey, I'm a growing boy.",
        "Mel: Yeah.",
        "Rick: Don't do that to my gut; that's not nice.",
        "Mel: You said you wanted to wear a bathing suit on our little beach getaway.",
        "Rick: Well, yes, but I'm not going to be running around in a speedo with my mesh showing. Hi. Thank you.",
        "Mel: Thank you.",
        "Rick: But you know what? You've got to admit, I mean with all of those renovations that we're doing, I've to be burning up a lot of calories.",
        "Mel: Renovations? We're painting our daughter's room.",
        "Rick: Painting's hard work, honey. It's very hard work.",
        "Mel: Sweetheart, you standing in the den and telling me where I missed a spot, that does not burn calories.",
        "Rick: Well, you're a better painter. You're a better cooker...",
        "Mel: Uh-huh.",
        "Rick: You have a better smile.",
        "Mel: You know what, you have paint on your face.",
        "Rick: Nice try. Nice try. But you know you've got to admit, honey, that you know, it's just fun. Isn't it just fun doing something together like a normal couple, like painting our daughter's bedroom?",
        "Mel: It is fun.",
        "Rick: I just cannot wait to be a full-time parent again.",
        "Mel: For a little while. Leah is only home for the summer.",
        "Rick: She might change her mind.",
        "Mel: She's not going to change her mind. She loves school.",
        "Rick: I can dream, can't I?",
        "Mel: Daddy's little girl coming home.",
        "Rick: It takes one to know one.",
        "Mel: Yeah, I know, I admit it. I am daddy's little girl and I'm proud of it.",
        "Rick: You know something real special that connects you between father and daughter. I just can't help but think what Phillip is missing and now Ross. I just-- I can't even go there.",
        "Mel: Sweetheart, that's why we have to treasure every moment as a family. Because you never know when things can change.",
        "Rick: You're right, again.",
        "Mel: Right.",

        "Cassie: Josh and Reva are about as happy as any couple can be.",
        "Billy: Wait, wait. That's always the way it is until the next time.",
        "Cassie: There isn't going to be a next time. They belong together. They're solid.",
        "Billy: Easy. I get the feeling you're trying to sell me something. You spent time with Josh, you spent a lot of time with him when he was split up from Reva.",
        "Cassie: And what does that have to do with anything?",
        "Josh: Hi, everybody. How you doing? Nice to see you.",
        "Photographer: Mr. Lewis, can I take a picture of you and your wife? ( Reporters ask questions all at once )",
        "Josh: Yes, you may. Let's do a couple right now. In a little bit we'll talk, okay, but for right now-- we'll do more pictures later, but for now, let's head on over here to the food. Help yourselves, folks.",
        "Reva: You know what, I'll be back in a second.",
        "Josh: Okay. So....",
        "Cassie: I can't even believe this is all coming together. You are really pulling this off?",
        "Josh: It's not me. It's you.",
        "Billy: Guys, guys, guys! Where's Reva?",
        "Reva: Great. Hello. So who invited the grim reaper?",
        "Billy: Hey, everybody! Step right up. Everybody, yes, sir.",
        "Josh: Come on over, folks. First of all, on behalf of the Lewis family, especially my father, Harlen Billy Lewis, I would like to thank you for being here today. I really appreciate it. Imagine with me for just a minute that you are returning from a foreign land where you have fought for our country, wounded, broken, facing a future that is uncertain. And, now, imagine entering a state-of-the-art facility where you will learn not just to walk again, but to run, to swim, to-- I don't know, kayak, to drive a car, to prepare yourself for the life ahead of you. And now imagine doing all of that with your family living right there at the complex with you for as long as you need them to be there. This was my father's dream. He believed strongly that as a community we owe our veterans this and so much more, and I am with him 100% on that. The H.B. Lewis Center will fulfill not just my father's dreams, but the dreams of countless men and women who have served this country and fought for our freedom. I invite you, and I encourage you to be part of this dream. Thank you for being with us today. (Cheers and applause )",

        "Reva: Let me guess, no alcohol? You're going to tell me that I'm throwing my life away by not taking care of myself?",
        "Colin: Any idea what time it is. My watch seemed to have stopped.",
        "Reva: Time for you to tell me exactly what you're doing here?",
        "Colin: You're husband invited me and Dr. Grant thought I should represent Cedars.",
        "Reva: Ooh, lucky you.",
        "Colin: Do you think it would be rude if I left, though? I have research waiting for me back at the lab.",
        "Reva: Bad, huh?",
        "Colin: Well, one or two here or there probably isn't deadly, but if you're asking me if it makes your condition worse, the answer is yes.",
        "Reva: Hey. That is not nice, steeling your patients' drinks.",
        "Colin: Why aren't you over there with your husband?",
        "Reva: I needed to put on some lipstick.",
        "Colin: It's hard to smile and pretend like nothing's wrong?",
        "Reva: I'm fine. I've been through a lot in my life and I always land on my feet.",
        "Colin: What if your husband sees the bandage from your lumpectomy?",
        "Reva: It's covered, literally. It's nice chatting with you. I have to go join my husband now. See you at radiation tomorrow. Oh, no.",
        "Josh: Hey, there you are.",
        "Reva: Is it over?",
        "Josh: Yes, it is. Where were you?",
        "Reva: It's a long and boring story. Am I in the doghouse?",
        "Josh: No, you're not in the doghouse. In fact, come on up here and dance with me. I'm so excited, I feel like I can fly. I think tomorrow at this time we're going to have more money than we ever dreamed. In fact, I feel like there's somebody up there helping us out just a little bit.",
        "Reva: Yeah, and I know who that somebody is. Harlen must be doing cartwheels. I'm so happy for you.",
        "Josh: Thank you. Kind of makes you want to dance.",
        "Reva: Oh!",
        "Josh: You okay?",
        "Reva: Yeah, I'm just a little sore.",
        "Josh: From what?",
        "Reva: I ran into that pantry door putting the groceries away. The speech was great.",
        "Josh: The only thing it was missing was you. But you can make it up to me.",
        "Reva: I really am so happy.",
        "Josh: Me, too. I'm happy for all of us. I mean this is a family thing, and I'm so glad that the whole family is here to celebrate. Come here. ( Laughter )",

        "Mel: Hey, you've got to finish that. You've got to get to Josh's party. Honey, what are you thinking about?",
        "Rick: I'm still on fathers and daughters. Honey, I know you didn't think much of Phillip, especially towards the end, but he was a spectacular father to Lizzie.",
        "Mel: I know this is going to sound harsh, but I think Lizzie's better off without him.",
        "Rick: Right, she's better off with Alan as stepdaddy/grandfather. That's sick. This town is getting scarier and scarier.",
        "Mel: I don't know if it is that or you know all of the stuff.",
        "Rick: Maybe not. Have you been in touch with Blake? Have you spoken to her?",
        "Mel: Yes, actually, yesterday.",
        "Rick: How is she doing? You know, I haven't touched base with her since Ross--",
        "Mel: Yeah, she mentioned that. She's doing okay. She is hanging in there. And she is busy with the three kids and the mayoral race.",
        "Rick: I really wish she would re-think that.",
        "Mel: Why?",
        "Rick: Honey, I love Blake, but the thought of her running Springfield, come on. I think Jeffrey's the better candidate.",
        "Mel: Oh, please. You've got to be kidding me.",
        "Rick: I know, honey, I'm a man. We're born, we're wrong and then we die. I'm wrong again.",
        "Mel: Listen, I invited her over with the kids when Leah comes home. I told her we should have dinner.",
        "Rick: That's a good idea.",
        "Mel: I still can't believe that Ross is gone. It's such a tragedy. Those poor kids are losing out on so many years of being with a terrific dad. We're all missing out.",
        "Rick: I miss him so much.",
        "Mel: Well, thank God our daughter has her two parents. I believe I took that for granted when I was younger.",
        "Rick: Lucky you.",
        "Mel: I am very lucky, and that's what I want for her. I want her to have two very happy parents when she comes home.",
        "Rick: Well, I'm happy now.",
        "Mel: Good.",
        "Rick: And I think it's time to go to the party. Because a party is not a party until I get there, right?",
        "Mel: Yes, honey. This is a fundraiser, so you brought your checkbook, right?",
        "Rick: Oops, I forgot.",
        "Mel: Honey, you are so cheap.",

        "Mallet: I know. I just don't want you to miss her. I mean, you know, she might have registered under a different name. Honey, please, I know how difficult it was looking for you. And you never complained, not even once, so whatever you need, okay?",
        "Gus: We're not leaving this island until we find her, okay?",

I don't know if you get service here, but if you do, could you call me. Hey, it's me again. Just tell me where you are. I miss you. Dinah, hey, come on, would you call me. I'm worried about you, okay? Where are you? Would you tell me where you are. I feel like a damned stalker. Dinah? Hey. Sorry, I thought you were somebody else. Have you seen this woman, here? Are you sure. How long have you been here?",

        "Alan-Michael: We had a few meetings.",
        "Dinah: Isn't that funny. You and I worked very closely together, and you failed to mention you were meeting my dad in D.C., Doing business with him, and very possibly the last person who met with him before he died. So who knows, maybe I'm going to be the last person you get to meet with.",

        "Ricky Paul Golden, \"Inside The Light.\" Theater is like a train ride that is like a wreck or a glorious trip. Once you start you can't stop. But this medium may be my favorite because we're flying and we're going really fast and we don't have a lot of time to prep and it's about relationships and chemistry. So it is like theater, and I think I'm on a movie every day. I treat it like that. See Gus, Wednesday, May 17, \"Inside The Light.\" .",

        "Dinah: I don't know, why don't you tell me?",
        "Alan-Michael: Nothing. How could killing Ross help me take over Spaulding. Maybe it would expose me as killing the most beloved man in Springfield.",

And then you vanish. You take off right before we're to take down Harley, and now we're talking sabotage, and it might not have been an accident at all. So you tell me what I'm supposed to think.",

        "Reva: So how does it feel to finally realize a dream?",
        "Josh: Well, we're not quite there, but so far we're pretty damned close.",
        "Reva: I am so proud of you.",

        "Cassie: Billy, they're faking it. They're really miserable.",
        "Billy: I just don't think this reconciliation is really going to last, that's all.",
        "Cassie: Why is that? Do you know something that I don't know?",
        "Billy: Probably. I used to be married to her.",
        "Cassie: And maybe you'd like to again?",
        "Billy: There is a lot of things I might like, but it doesn't mean I'm going to get it, does it?",
        "Cassie: My God, Billy. You've got to let that go. Because they're about a million miles from ever being apart again. You're fooling yourself if you think...",
        "Billy: Oh, really.",
        "Cassie: Did it ever occur to you that maybe you're the one in a rush.",
        "Billy: That's harsh.",
        "Cassie: You think that's harsh. You mess with my sister's happiness, and I will show you harsh.",

        "Josh: Hey, how are you.",
        "Rick: Congratulations.",
        "Mel: That's a nice color on you. Paint on your face. We're getting Leah's room ready, and Rick insisted on painting it that color. She's 14, it's midnight blue-- I'll let you guys fight it out. Right now I have to concentrate on packing.",
        "Reva: Where you going?",
        "Mel: My husband is taking me on a romantic island get-away.",
        "Rick: Romantic. Alan and Beth are renewing their vows. The only thing romantic about that is how much champagne I'll have to drink to get through it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I know that Reva has helped you a lot lately, and it's easy to mistake that kind of caring for someone.",
        "Billy: Can we talk about something else?",
        "Cassie: No, Billy. I think you need to be clear about..",
        "Billy: Shh, here's Josh.",
        "Josh: Did you tell her about Cross Creek? About how I'm going to surprise Reva, and take the whole cabin and move it right here to Springfield.",
        "Cassie: Stop it.",
        "Josh: Yes!",
        "Cassie: Mr. Romance, I didn't think you could top yourself bringing Reva to Cross Creek, but now you're going to bring Cross Creek to Reva.",
        "Josh: That's the plan. It's really been important to Reva, and why not have that in our lives every day. So I'm going to give it to her as a gift.",
        "Cassie: You are just full of surprises.",
        "Josh: I think it's my turn. Reva has made a career out of surprising me, right?",

        "Gus: He died in a plane accident. I guess you didn't hear about it. And now his daughter is missing and we're kind of worried about her safety.",
        "Harley: I can't lose them both.",
        "Hotel manager: I'm very sorry to hear about Mr. Marler. He spoke often of his family. I thought you had red hair?",
        "Gus: She dyed it. Anyway, if we can get into the room...",
        "Harley: Dinah may have been in there.",
        "Hotel manager: No one has been in that room.",
        "Gus: We would like to get into that room to get his things.",

I've been to the Spaulding house, and no one has been there, including Alan-Michael, so we've got to find Dinah soon because I... we've got to find her. Call me. Call me. Come on, man, what's your problem, I don't want a damn-- I don't want a damn photo. Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: My timing was bad. I went out of town and didn't tell you. But it's no reason to... look, put down the gun and we can forget about this.",
        "Dinah: Back up. Move! I want to talk to you about coincidences. What a coincidence it was that you vanished when my father died. What a coincidence it was that I found you here under a registered name, an entirely different name, and what a coincidence it is I have a gun pointed at you, and what a coincidence it's going to be when you go over 60, 70 feet.",
        "Alan-Michael: Dinah, slow down.",
        "Dinah: My father's life was worth a million of yours. And I'm going to take what I can get.",
        "Alan-Michael: Look, if you pull that trigger, you'll be saying good-bye to everything you accomplished. You were the CEO of Spaulding Enterprises. You have the respect of everyone in town. You have a great guy. Mallet loves you, Dinah. What would this do to him? Do not pull the trigger.",
        "Dinah: I'm not going to shoot you. But you might have an accident, like my father had an accident. Do you know what he was to me? Huh? Do you know how much he grounded me. Do you know how proud I wanted to make him, but that's not going to happen now. That's not going to happen now because he's not going to be able to see me turn my life around. He is not going to see me walk down the aisle if I ever get married. He can't hold his grandchildren, and he can't even hold my children. So let me tell you something, I'm not okay with that! I'm not okay with that, and I don't care what it takes, I'm going to make sure you understand it.",
        "Alan-Michael: Look, what you do matters. If you do this, think about Mallet, your mother, Harley, your brother Bill. What you do matters.",
        "Dinah: Let me tell you something. You know how good it feels to be on top. People say it's good.",
        "Alan-Michael: Yes, and you have so much potential.",
        "Dinah: But when you're on top, you have a great view, but sometimes you go a little too far, and whoa!",

        "Mallet: This one, where did you take this one? Where? Where did you take that one? Yeah? Thank you.",

        "Harley: We've been so busy looking for Dinah, sometimes I forget that Ross really is gone. God, I miss him. You know? I found something.",
        "Gus: What?",
        "Harley: The PI who died on the plane with Ross. Her business card, Nicole Landers.",
        "Gus: Who do you expect to reach?",
        "Harley: I'm not sure. Let's see. Hi, I'm a friend of Ross Marler's, and Ross employed Nicole as a... right. Yes. So you know all about that? I'm sorry, who am I speaking to? Kelsey, Nicole's partner. I'm really sorry for your loss. I'm sure that you want to find out why that plane went down as much as I do. Did Nicole keep any notes or files on this case? You sure? Nothing? Well, that's something. How soon can you get it to us?",

        "Cassie: Josh is so hopeful right now. I am not going to let you get in the way of that.",

        "Cassie: Whether I need to or not, that's what I'm doing. Because I won't let anyone interfere with Josh and Reva, not anyone.",

        "Cassie: I don't know. Are you?",
        "Billy: No. The worst period of my life Reva was there. She was a raft, and I climbed up on it and she saved me. When somebody does that for you, it's sometimes hard to let go. Maybe that is something you can't understand.",
        "Cassie: Maybe I can.",
        "Josh: Hey, not you, but would you like to dance with me? I can't seem to track down my wife.",

        "Reva: Dr. McCabe was going over some medical statistics that I thought would be great in the press package for the project. So I thought I would go over to Cedars and check it all out if you've got everything handled here?",
        "Josh: No, no, I got my dance in. I'm doing fine. I'll see you at home.",
