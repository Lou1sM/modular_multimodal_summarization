I've learned a lot hanging out with you guys these past couple of months.", "Marina: Really?", "Sandy: Yeah. Not to get weird on you or anything...", "Marina: Oh, no. It's okay. Be weird. You can't help it.", "Sandy: But you guys have inspired me to look at my own life, and I realize there are a few changes I want to make, too.", "Marina: Great.

Up at the mansion. I was looking for Tammy.", "Phillip: Mm-hmm.", "Edmund: It's amazing how Spaulding-like she's become.", "Phillip: What does that mean?", "Edmund: Well, I just think that Beth should have taken her out of that house years ago.", "Phillip: I see. So because of Tammy, you're now an expert on raising children?", "Edmund: Hardly. Hardly. I just think that Lizzie was once a very sweet girl and now...", "Phillip: Edmund, you would be wise to keep your opinions to yourself. Especially when they regard my daughter.", "Edmund: Oh, I'm not blaming Lizzie.", "Phillip: No. And you're not blaming Beth.", "Edmund: No. I saw the paper today.", "Phillip: (Laughs)", "Edmund: Did you have a nice vacation?", "Phillip: More two-bit advice? Thank you anyway, but I'll pass again.", "Edmund: How about a word of caution?", "Phillip: How about no?", "Edmund: Forgo the corporate intrigue and pay attention to your daughter.", "Phillip: Edmund, not that it's any of your business, but my daughter is perfectly fine. She had some problems a while ago, but she's put them behind her.", "Edmund: Your daughter kidnapped your child from its mother.", "Phillip: I asked her to bring Emma to me at the hospital. There was no kidnapping.", "Edmund: And Olivia was sick about it.", "Phillip: It was a misunderstanding. End of story.", "Edmund: Ah. Well, I think I'll still stick to my two-bit analysis: Lizzie is hurting and so Lizzie is lashing out. Which means Phillip needs to step up to the plate and be a father for once in his life.", "Phillip: Edmund, why would I ever take any advice from you?", "Edmund: Because I speak from first-hand experience. My father had time for everything except me, and look how I turned out. \u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: Nothing.

You know in this line of work, you make one wrong move; it puts Nico in Salerno's line of fire. Now, of course, you could have stayed on the outside where you belong, and you wouldn't have had to break the kid's heart.", "Danny: Shut up, Tony. I am so sick of your self- righteous act. Stop acting like you think you're better than me.", "Tony: I... (Laughs)", "Danny: Just get off my back, all right?", "Tony: Why don't you go home? There's nothing for you to do here.

I've got a husband, I've got a son and I've got a life of my own.", "Bill: A life with more ups and down than anyone I've known. Michelle, it doesn't have to be that way.", "Michelle: I love my life. I love my husband. And I know exactly who he is.", "Bill: No, see I don't think you do. Because buying votes is probably small potatoes compared to what he's up to now.", "Michelle: We don't know anything, Bill!", "Bill: Michelle he is hanging out with Vinnie Salerno in public.", "Michelle: Yeah, well, he's got to do what he's got to do.", "Bill: He's got to do... what does that mean? Do you even know how that sounds?", "Michelle: What about you?", "Bill: What about me?", "Michelle: You're such a hypocrite. It's so easy for you to attack Danny. Well, what about if I started attacking Eden? Now how would like that?", "Bill: There not the same thing.", "Michelle: Well, Eden used to work for Salerno, didn't she?", "Bill: A long time ago. And she never tried to hide it.", "Michelle: Well, I guess we both love people with less than perfect pasts.", "Bill: Michelle, we're talking about people in their past. We're talking about the present. Danny is back with the mob, okay-- not assuming he ever got out of it.", "Michelle: Nothing you can say is going to change my mind about Danny!", "Bill: All right.

Now do you want to give your job back or what?", "Olivia: You want me to fail.", "Alan: No, of course I don't want you to fail. You're trying to save my company.", "Olivia: Fine.

Otherwise the surprise will be yours.", "Gus: Phillip, please, I'm a cop. I would hope that my instincts are decent.", "Phillip: I'm sure they're very decent.

I'll still be the same guy.", "Phillip: Really? Did you tell her?", "Gus: For what?", "Phillip: Because our family had a lot to do with finally finishing us off.", "Gus: Yes, yes, I've heard the story.
