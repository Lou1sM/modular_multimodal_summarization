        "Olivia was still trying to get her grubby paws on Spalding stock when Alex wandered in with Emma. Danny left Michelle to meet the ship at the dock. After he left, Ed, Rick and Mel arrived so Ed could bid tearful goodbyes and ride off into the African sunset. Gus told Phillip that the woes at Spalding aren't just corporate and that he shouldn't set himself as the fall guy for the company. Phillip grilled Alan about what the problems at Spalding really are. Harley skulked around Pier 14 looking for clues. Jeffery ordered her out of the area after she spied Danny lurking around for his own clues. Olivia suspects Bill may be the one buying up Spalding stock, though he denies interest.",
        "Tony found Danny hiding behind boxes, caught red-handed lurking around. Tony admitted he set Danny up and can't trust him now. Danny made Tony believe he left but instead he stayed. Jeffery showed up and they came up empty-handed after going through one of the boxes. Harley found antimonious inside a box of Eden's wedding decorations."

    "Transcript": [
        "Olivia: Who is snapping up Spaulding stock? No, of course you can find out. When a block of shares that big sells, it has to be reported. That's the best you can do? The buyer has a Springfield address? Get me more information, or I'm getting a new broker, you moron!",
        "Alexandra: Oh, look it, darling, mommy's working away and insulting somebody.",
        "Olivia: What are you doing with her? Sweetheart. Hi, baby. What... how did you get your hands on her? I gave my nanny strict instructions not to let anybody like you...",
        "Alexandra: Well, I can be very persuasive. You know that.",
        "Olivia: And my nanny's going to be very fired.",
        "Alexandra: Look... oh, come on. Olivia, you work such long hours. I mean, I just thought Emma would be missing you, that's all.",
        "Olivia: Nothing is ever \"all\" with you.",
        "Alexandra: Fine, fine. It was a very bad idea. So, darling, you wave bye-bye to mommy, okay?",
        "Olivia: No, just leave. Don't touch her.",
        "Alexandra: We'll go onto to another adventure.",
        "Olivia: Come here, sweetheart. Come here. Ooh.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, come on, I'm only trying to be a helpful auntie here.",
        "Olivia: Give me a break. I know what you're up to... Auntie.",
        "Phillip: Me. (Phone rings)",
        "Eden: Hello?",
        "Harley: Hi. It's me. I'm sorry. I know I'm late. But it gets worse. I can't make it.",
        "Eden: You can't?",
        "Harley: No. I'm sorry. I know I said I was going to help you with the decorations for your party. They did get delivered, right?",
        "Eden: Yeah, I expect them any time now.",
        "Harley: Okay, good. It's just that this work thing came up, and it's really important. I can't get out of it.",
        "Eden: Harley, you know what? It's okay. I was going to cancel anyway. I have a really horrible headache.",
        "Harley: Oh, good. I mean, not good that you have a headache, but good that I'm not screwing you up. And listen, if I finish up soon enough, maybe I'll head over to your place afterwards, okay?",
        "Eden: No, it's okay. Why don't we just talk tomorrow?",
        "Harley: Okay. Sorry.",
        "Eden: Okay.",
        "Harley: Bye.",
        "Harley: Hey, it's me. Where are you?",
        "Jeffrey: I'm busy. Where are you? Are you at the docks?",
        "Harley: Not yet.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, why not? What are you waiting for? Get down there. The \"gilded lily\" is set to tie up about now.",
        "Harley: Don't worry. I will get down to the docks in plenty of time to check out to check out Marie Greene's shipment.",
        "Jeffrey: All right. You confirm its arrival and then you get out of there. That's it.",
        "Harley: Listen, I was thinking about that, Jeffrey. If those drugs are being smuggled in the antiques, I want to prove that, you know? This could crack the case wide open.",
        "Jeffrey: In and out, terrier. That's an order. Now go, and keep me posted. All right, you got all your gear? Okay, get to work. Salerno's at some christening, and he's not going to be back for a while. This is a perfect opportunity for us to get this place wired. I want to be able to hear every single word that's spoken in there.",
        "Agent: We could really use a mole, someone on Salerno's crew.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, we could.",
        "Rick: Hey.",
        "Mel: Hi.",
        "Michelle: Well, this is a surprise.",
        "Mel: Well, we thought we'd just come by for a visit.",
        "Rick: Yeah, while our family's are still intact.",
        "Ed: What he's trying to say is they brought me over to say a fast good-bye. Your brother's not crazy about this, but I got a call a little while ago, and we're all set. I'm definitely going to Africa.",
        "Rick: Well, can you blame me? We're on borrowed time here, aren't we?",
        "Ed: You see, a seat opened on a diplomatic charter to Africa... tonight.",
        "Michelle: Tonight?",
        "Ed: Got to be at the airport in two hours.",
        "Rick: So, can you all believe he's leaving tonight?",
        "Ed: There won't be another flight for two weeks, Rick.",
        "Rick: (Sighs) dad, you just told us about your plans. I mean, listen, can't we have just a little time to get used to the idea? This is crazy.",
        "Ed: But you think the whole idea is crazy. I mean, thank god your sister is on my side.",
        "Michelle: I just know how important it is for you to feel like you need to make a difference. And I also realize that Dr. Sandarac needs his help. This epidemic is taking over this village. I did think we'd have a little more time to...",
        "Ed: To say good-bye.",
        "Michelle: I can't believe you're going.",
        "Ed: And the faster I get over there, the bigger a difference I can make. If I don't get on that plane tonight, it's just going to be selfish.",
        "Mel: You've never sounded more like a doctor, Ed.",
        "Ed: Well, I'm in good company, sweetie.",
        "Rick: Two hours. Two hours.",
        "Ed: It's going to be fine. Now, listen, this is how I want you to think of it. I am on call. They need me in the ER, and it's just that the ER is 10,000 miles away. Where's Danny? I want to say good-bye to him, too.",
        "Michelle: Danny's not here. He had an important business meeting. And he's going to be really upset that he didn't get a chance to say good-bye to you. I just can't believe that you're really going. But it's the right thing, dad. It is. It's the right thing. It is.",
        "Ed: Thanks.",
        "Alexandra: Olivia, all I'm trying to do is give a lonely little girl some attention.",
        "Olivia: Oh, please. Just give me a break. You're trying to be a helpful auntie? This isn't a visit, it's a guilt trip.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, not at all. Although I will admit I am concerned about this precious little child.",
        "Olivia: You are unbelievable.",
        "Alexandra: Well, no, no. She spends all day with a sterile nanny while you're off dedicating your day to business and money and self-interest.",
        "Olivia: Oh, you have no idea how wrong you are.",
        "Alexandra: Well, you know, in my day...",
        "Olivia: In your day, you didn't come home to your kids because you didn't raise them, Alexandra. I know my Spaulding history.",
        "Alexandra: Fine, exactly my point.",
        "Olivia: Emma is going to be fine. In fact, she is fine. She knows that everything that I'm doing here is to give her a bright and beautiful future, don't you, sweetheart? Fyi: We don't make women feel like bad mothers because they're maintaining their careers. It's very pass\u00e9.",
        "Alexandra: Well, you know, still I wonder who you love more, this child or all of this. (Baby coos)",
        "Olivia: Both. How's that? Besides, somebody has to keep an eye on things around here.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, what? It might as well be you?",
        "Olivia: I've got my finger on the pulse of this company, yes. For example, someone has been buying up large, large blocks of stock recently.",
        "Alexandra: Who? I certainly wish it were me. If I had a little bit more clout, I'd make sure that things are run a bit differently around here. Oh, don't leave on my account.",
        "Olivia: Well, actually, I'm not. I have a nanny to fire. (Baby crying) it's okay, sweetheart. Okay, sweetie. Besides, I was just leaving when you got here.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, were you?",
        "Olivia: Yes, yes. So your little ploy to shame me out of the office didn't work. I'll be back behind that desk tomorrow morning. Alexandra. Hey, up here. Don't you so much as go near my daughter again without my permission. You got it?",
        "Alexandra: Well, Olivia, if my little ploy didn't work, why are you gone and I'm still here? (Metal clang)",
        "Olivia: A few minutes with Auntie Alex can ruin anybody's day. She's done that to me so many times. Are you smiling?",
        "Bill: My, my, my. Look who has a life.",
        "Olivia: Hi. Is that so hard to believe?",
        "Bill: Well, considering the corporate pressures those Spaulding types put on you; I'm surprised they let you out of the office.",
        "Olivia: Well, don't tell anyone, but I escaped.",
        "Bill: Is that right?",
        "Olivia: Yeah.",
        "Bill: Well, now, there's a secret I don't know if I can keep. People need to know. Spaulding is a publicly traded company. (Clears throat)",
        "Olivia: Cut me a break, just this once?",
        "Bill: Well, maybe just this once. I guess the last thing your stock needs is a jolt of crummy pr. I mean, it's tanking on its own, pretty badly.",
        "Olivia: You follow the Spaulding share price?",
        "Bill: Well, it's hard not to when the media is doing a story or a number on it every other day. But what I do find amazing is how fast the stock can go down.",
        "Olivia: Well, that will change, you know. I mean, the basic principle of the stock market is to buy low and sell high. Spaulding stock might be really appealing to somebody who is looking to make a killing in the end, when things turn around.",
        "Bill: I wouldn't know. I'm just a simple hammer-and- nails type of guy.",
        "Olivia: I don't know. You run one of the top construction firms in the region, and I certainly wouldn't call you simple.",
        "Bill: Well. You calling me a liar?",
        "Olivia: I'll go with \"disingenuous.\"",
        "Bill: That's a big word.",
        "Olivia: That's big money, which is probably what you're making, right?",
        "Bill: Well, now, that is a personal question.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, so?",
        "Bill: Well, I'm doing okay.",
        "Olivia: Well, good. So you probably want to do something smarter with your cash than to throw it into a savings account. So do you play... the market?",
        "Bill: Who, me?",
        "Olivia: Mm-hmm.",
        "Bill: Nah. I wouldn't know what I was doing if I tried. (Clattering)",
        "Dock worker #2: What are you doing in here?",
        "Tony: Get out of here. Go out of here. I'm on Salerno's business. Go. Get out of here. Go. Get out of here! This is unbelievable, you know that? Salerno told you to... he told you that this was none of your business. You ignored him. You came to me, sniffing around for information. What's going on?",
        "Danny: Well, Tony, I want to be involved.",
        "Tony: You do, huh?",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Tony: That why you went through my stuff when I blew you off? Checking to see if I wrote anything down about tonight?",
        "Danny: What are you talking about?",
        "Tony: Danny, you think I left that pad? You think it wasn't an accident? I left it on purpose, all right?",
        "Danny: Whoa, Tony. You set me up.",
        "Tony: I needed to know if I could trust you. Obviously I can't.",
        "Rick: Yes, it is, dad, but you can make a difference right here in Springfield. You know that.",
        "Mel: Rick, honey, your father has got to follow his own path.",
        "Rick: Mel, your parents live ten minute away. Now, come on, you've never been through something like this before.",
        "Mel: Honey, look, I'm going to miss him, too, okay? But he's made up his mind. Let's not make this any harder.",
        "Ed: Now, see, that's why you're my favorite daughter-in- law. I'm going to count on you to keep your eye on these two, you know?",
        "Mel: I'll do my best.",
        "Rick: So, have you called roses and holly?",
        "Ed: I'm going to call roses from the airport. Holly knows about this.",
        "Michelle: I think we should make a toast, okay? Rick?",
        "Rick: Go ahead.",
        "Michelle: All right. Here's to...",
        "Ed: (Laughs) oh, come on, you two. Please. Come on.",
        "Michelle: I can do this. I can do this. Okay. Here's to the bravest man I've ever known.",
        "Ed: Oh, sweetie.",
        "Rick: Um, actually, dad, Mel was asking me about how you get recruited for a doctor in a place like this, so maybe you could tell her about it.",
        "Ed: Oh, yeah. Sure. I mean, once the international agencies know that you're willing to go overseas, then they just contact you. You put your name on a list, and they get to you and say, \"When do you want to go? What area are you interested in?\"",
        "Rick: Help me here, Michelle. Help me. How can you think this is the right thing for him to do?",
        "Michelle: How can you not, Rick?",
        "Rick: Last time he left, years went by until we saw him again. Is that what you want?",
        "Michelle: Rick, look how excited he is. Look at him. He wants this so badly. He needs this.",
        "Rick: What about what our family needs? I mean, is it so terrible to want our father around to be a part of our lives? I mean, another doctor could easily fill in that slot until he's ready to go, right?",
        "Michelle: He's ready now, Rick.",
        "Rick: Are you ready? Be honest. Are you ready for our father to leave?",
        "Michelle: No.",
        "Rick: All right. Then talk him out of it, Michelle.",
        "Michelle: What?",
        "Rick: He will not listen to me. You're the one who talked him into going to Africa in the first place. Tell him it's too soon. Tell him that we need him to stay.",
        "Michelle: I can't, Rick.",
        "Rick: Okay. Then in two hours, our father is going to be on some plane and we're not going to see him again. Is that what you want?",
        "Danny: Tony, I'm trying to prove myself to Vinnie.",
        "Tony: Danny, Salerno gave you one thing to follow, and that was to stay out of it. You couldn't do it. Why?",
        "Danny: I don't know, you tell me.",
        "Tony: You're not fit to take orders, you know that? You think you're too good for everyone in this crew, Vinnie included. Am I right? It's true.",
        "Danny: That's not true.",
        "Tony: (Scoffs) \"that's not true.\" Danny, you were begging Salerno to take you back in. Didn't you?",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Tony: You said that he was the boss. He knows everything, everything's right, goes by him. You couldn't follow it. Goes to show you. Proves it.",
        "Danny: What, Tony? Tell me what...",
        "Tony: You shouldn't have gotten back in, Danny. You don't belong in this game anymore. Go find something normal for yourself before you create more problems. (Sirens approaching) you know what? Listen to me. That's the cops. He called the cops. You get out of here. We better split. You and I can deal with this later.",
        "Danny: Sorry.",
        "Tony: You understand?",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Jeffrey: Danny, what are you doing here? Get out of here.",
        "Danny: No. Too bad, O'Neill. I got work to do.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, frank, it looks like it was a false alarm. I'm sorry. Yeah, I'll get back to you. What are you doing, Danny? I told you to get out of here.",
        "Danny: If these crates contain the goods to nail Salerno, I'll be done with him and done with you.",
        "Jeffrey: Hey. Hey!",
        "Danny: What? You think that Salerno's smuggling antimonious in from san Cristobel. How else are we going to find out?",
        "Jeffrey: Danny.",
        "Danny: I don't believe this. There's nothing in these crates! They're clean. There are no drugs in here.",
        "Jeffrey: Is that the last one?",
        "Danny: Yes! (Sighs)",
        "Jeffrey: Satisfied?",
        "Danny: Do I look like I'm satisfied?",
        "Jeffrey: It's a bad lead, Danny. That's what happens sometimes.",
        "Danny: Why would Salerno be so protective of these crates?",
        "Jeffrey: Danny? You want to get this guy; you want this to be over. So do I. But these things take time, Danny. Stakeouts take time!",
        "Danny: O'Neill, I know how it works.",
        "Jeffrey: You want to nail him? You're going to have to listen to me, okay? You're going to have to do what I tell you to do. That's the only way we're going to bring him down.",
        "Alan: Gus. How are you? How's... how's work going?",
        "Gus: Slow and steady. Good to run into you.",
        "Alan: Well, I'm glad to hear that.",
        "Gus: Yeah. You going in? Because if you're going in, just... I'll give you a little heads up. I was talking to Phillip.",
        "Alan: Really? About what?",
        "Gus: Well, Spaulding. What else? And he was telling me how he's not going to be going back right away.",
        "Alan: Wait a minute. You didn't tell him about the mob and the drugs, did you?",
        "Gus: No. No, I didn't. And I suggest that you don't. Well, you know that. Two reasons, let me remind you. First of all, O'Neill would fry you for giving out information about an undercover operation. Number two, Phillip, god help him, he might go nuts again from such bad news.",
        "Alan: Well, don't worry. I'm not going to tell Phillip anything specific. I'm going to keep it all general.",
        "Gus: Okay.",
        "Alan: But thanks for giving me a heads up on this.",
        "Gus: Oh, I'm just trying to keep the damage down, you know? The less that it causes...",
        "Alan: So am I, son.",
        "Gus: Good to see you. Hey.",
        "Harley: Hi.",
        "Gus: Hi. How's it going in there?",
        "Harley: Not good.",
        "Gus: Why, what happened?",
        "Harley: I will tell you later. Actually, I'm dropping in to see your sister. Or not. I hear the water running. She is never going to hear me knocking.",
        "Gus: Well, why don't you stop knocking and start using the key that she keeps under the mat?",
        "Harley: Well, aren't you the helpful brother?",
        "Gus: So it was a bad night?",
        "Harley: Pretty much. First I had to bail out on my plans with your sister to go to the docks. Then there were the docks, which made me feel even worse.",
        "Gus: And you're at Eden's because of what?",
        "Harley: Because I'm trying to salvage some part of my evening.",
        "Gus: Right. And so it didn't go well at the docks?",
        "Harley: I don't want to talk about it.",
        "Gus: Well, did they make the bust?",
        "Harley: I don't know. Maybe it did, I don't know, and I don't care. Frankly, the last thing on my mind right now is... antimonious.",
        "Gus: Harley? Hello?",
        "Alan: Are you ready to get some dinner?",
        "Phillip: Uh, yeah, in a minute. I was speaking with Gus a little earlier.",
        "Alan: Yes?",
        "Phillip: Yeah. He didn't give me any details.",
        "Alan: Mm-hmm.",
        "Phillip: But he led me to believe that the situation at Spaulding is much worse than what I thought.",
        "Alan: Well, I hope this investigation gets over as soon as possible, Phillip.",
        "Phillip: Our stock's taking a pounding.",
        "Alan: Yes, I know it is. And I'm concerned about that, but I'm more concerned about you. I mean, you've been a real trooper, understanding that we want your transition back into the company to happen slowly. I would never have agreed to this, except...",
        "Phillip: I know, dad, except the stock can't take another hit.",
        "Alan: Right.",
        "Phillip: No, I understand that. It's okay. It really is. No, you did the right thing. Olivia should be in charge at Spaulding for the time being. At least until the investigators find what it is they're looking for. It's all for the best.",
        "Danny: Honey.",
        "Michelle: Oh, Danny. Oh, thank god you're all right.",
        "Danny: I'm fine. How did it go with your dad?",
        "Michelle: He's gone.",
        "Danny: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.",
        "Michelle: I know you had to go.",
        "Danny: I wish I could have...",
        "Michelle: It's okay. I understand, you had to go.",
        "Danny: I'm sorry.",
        "Michelle: Did you find anything?",
        "Danny: No. No! Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.",
        "Michelle: Hey. You have me, okay? We have each other.",
        "Alan: Next, on \"Guiding Light.\"",
        "Michelle: Take any action against Danny and you're gong to regret it, Tony.",
        "Tony: You don't belong in here, all right, Michelle? I'm sorry. Danny...",
        "Michelle: Don't turn your back on me, Tony. You do not want me as your enemy.",
        "Harley: You're the connection for smuggling drugs into Springfield from San Cristobel.",
        "Eden: I am doing what I have to do to save my life, Harley!"
