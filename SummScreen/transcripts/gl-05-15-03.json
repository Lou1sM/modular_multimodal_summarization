        "As Marina and Tammy were talking outside of \"Company\", Lizzie arrived. Marina told her off for ratting to Frank about the new car Ben gave her, but Lizzie insisted she didn't rat-out Marina on purpose, that she'd made a \"slip\". Offering to rectify the matter, Lizzie suggested they all go out to the impound lot and drive the car away. Against Tammy's better judgment, she tagged along with them. At the impound lot, Lizzie suggested Tammy boost Marina over the fence into the lot, and also directed Marina to drive her car away and stash it behind a garage on Spaulding property. As Lizzie kept watch, a cop came around and asked why she was there, but Lizzie lied, saying her name was Marah Lewis and that her car had broken down. As this was happening, the cop noticed Marina driving off with the car and he radioed for back-up, not allowing Lizzie to take off, either. Meanwhile, at \"Company\", Harley attempted to break the ice with Frank, but he blasted her for her decision to quit the force and remain with Gus, whereas Harley needled Frank for letting his new promotion alter his judgment and his attitude. When Harley asked Frank why he reinstated Gus, Frank told her he didn't---that he was pressured into it. At that time, Frank received a call from a cop at the police station, who told him about Marina and 2 of her friends being taken down to lock-up. While the girls cooled their heels in jail, Marina was tense about Frank finding out, and Tammy was worried what her mother would think, but Lizzie wasn't worrying at all. She told the two that the situation would easily be \"fixed\" and that it was a plus that Marina's dad was the chief. Frank and Harley arrived and an angry and disappointed Frank pretended not to know who Marina or the girls were and walked away. Later, he directed a cop to give the girls a few more minutes to sweat things out and let them go.",
        "Josh, Reva and Shayne all went to \"Company\", buoyed by the successful ballgame Shayne just played. As they were enjoying themselves, an agent approached them and began to spout off ideas on how he could manage Shayne's baseball career and bring him great success. Reva, annoyed by the man, said that the family was going home, but she was irritated when Josh invited the man back to their house. Later, the agent told Reva and Josh how Shayne would do best to go to a baseball camp in Florida immediately, and Reva was angered to learn that it would mean Shayne wouldn't be able to finish high-school. After hearing more ideas from the pushy agent, Reva threw him out of the house, but Josh followed him outside. Josh was surprised when the agent showed him a contract that he'd already drawn-up with Shayne's name on it. The contract needed both parents' signatures on it, and Josh, floored by the agent's suggestion that Josh forge Reva's signature on the document, ripped up the contract and told the man to leave. When Josh saw Reva, he recounted what happened and told her she was right about the agent.",
        "In St.Cristobel, after getting off the phone with Alonzo, Edmund told Cassie that Alonzo had a sudden council meeting to attend and couldn't meet with them to discuss a site for Richard's memorial library. Edmund suggested he and Cassie rent a motorcycle and travel the beautiful countryside to choose a site for the library, and Cassie wholeheartedly agreed. Later, after they returned to the hotel and settled back into their rooms for the night, there was a power outage and their phones weren't working either. Through their adjoining door, Edmund offered to give Cassie a lighted candle, but Cassie turned him down and started to settle into bed, but when she threw the covers aside, she was startled to see an Iguana there! Responding to her cries, Edmund entered her room and got rid of the reptile for her. Telling him she didn't think she'd be able to sleep, Edmund offered to sit up and talk with her for a while. After much talk, Cassie told him how much she loved Richard, yet she didn't want to spend the rest of her life alone, either. Looking at her, Edmund softly told Cassie that she was a young, vibrant beautiful woman and that she'd known great love, and that she has every right to know it again--- if that's what she wants. Staring over at Edmund, Cassie quietly told him that she DOES."

        "Josh: Too good! Too good! We've got to get some ice on that wrist, but that was a fantastic game, son.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, well, I'm just lucky we won.",
        "Josh: No, no, no. You were good and that's a whole lot better than lucky. Uh, Reva, could you...?",
        "Reva: Yes, I'll get ice. I'll get ice for his wrist.",
        "Josh: How's the wrist feeling? You swelling up there a little bit?",
        "Shayne: Yeah, a little bit.",
        "Josh: You know, when you took that line drive, I think my heart skipped a beat.",
        "Shayne: That's because I tried to jam the guy. But I had to. I was in some major trouble right there.",
        "Josh: Oh, no you weren't. You know, you had one tough inning where you got behind a little bit, but other than that, son, nobody could touch you. And I want to tell you something: I was very proud of you.",
        "Shayne: So, what if I'd gotten shelled? Would you have still been proud of me, then? If...",
        "Josh: What kind of a question is that, huh? I mean, in the first place, you didn't get shelled. You had one tough inning, you stayed poised and you worked your way out of it. And the answer to your question is, yes. I would have been proud of you no matter what happened.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Why don't you go inside and congratulate Shayne?",
        "Marina: Oh, I already told him \"Good job\" on the field. Besides, his dad's in there and he kind of thinks I'm a pain.",
        "Tammy: Why?",
        "Marina: Because I dare to talk baseball with him. Me. A girl.",
        "Tammy: Hm. Josh is pretty intense about Shayne.",
        "Marina: Oh, yeah. You've heard of stage mothers? He's a diamond dad.",
        "Tammy: I hate when grownups try to zoom in like that. Edmund's doing it right now, with my mom. He's suddenly all into her and it's really creeping me out.",
        "Marina: I don't know. I mean, I think he's a trip, but I guess I really wouldn't want him hanging out with my mom. I don't even like my mom.",
        "Tammy: How can my mom forget all the horrible things Edmund's done?",
        "Marina: Well, it just goes along with my whole theory that parents are really messed up. And they're not the only ones.",
        "Lizzie: Hi.",
        "Tammy: Hi.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, I got it. I accidentally told your dad about that car Ben got you. I make one little mistake and you're ready to shut me out of your life for good, right?",
        "Marina: Well, it sounds like a plan to me, yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: No, we arrived just a little while ago. Right. (Laughs)",
        "Cassie: Is that Alonzo? Tell him \"Hi.\"",
        "Edmund: Cassie says hi. She's fine, fine. \"Hi\" back. So, about the library: Cassie and I have put together a short- list of the sites we'd like to see today with the architect.",
        "Cassie: Tell him I brought tons of pictures of Will.",
        "Edmund: Cassie says that... You heard? You heard? Okay, good. He's dying to see them. Okay, about today, I... Why is that? No, no. It's not a problem, if it can't be avoided... Right. No, no, I understand. That's fine. Good, then we'll see you tomorrow. Right. Bye.",
        "Cassie: Something wrong?",
        "Edmund: It's a council meeting that he can't reschedule.",
        "Cassie: So our plans are on hold.",
        "Edmund: Well, it's not a total loss. I know exactly what we can do in the meantime.",
        "Cassie: What is it we could do, exactly?",
        "Edmund: We can take this journey of ours to a different place.",
        "Cassie: Sounds like you have one in mind.",
        "Edmund: Coral Mountain, for starters.",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, why stay here just because some official expedition was canceled until tomorrow?",
        "Cassie: You want to go out now? I mean, isn't it kind of late?",
        "Edmund: On a motorcycle.",
        "Cassie: Are you joking?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I know this island like the back of my hand and so do you. We don't need some motorcade bloated with Bureaucrats and P.R. people acting as tour guides to show us around to Richard's library sites. We can do that ourselves.",
        "Cassie: I guess we are going to pick out the location ourselves, in the end, right?",
        "Edmund: Mm-hmm. I can have a motorcycle in an hour. We can be at Aguilera Crest in two. It's a full moon tonight. It will be beautiful.",
        "Cassie: Where?",
        "Edmund: It's one of the most beautiful places on the face of the planet, Cassie, not to mention San Cristobel. I became very well acquainted with it when I was hiding in the mountains.",
        "Cassie: Must have been nice to have a beautiful place to visit while you were planning your coup against Richard.",
        "Edmund: Long time ago, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: You're right. It was.",
        "Edmund: You game?",
        "Cassie: You going to let me drive?",
        "Edmund: Half the time.",
        "Cassie: I'll change. Make sure you rent us a big one-- 750 at least.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Come on, guys. Please don't fight.",
        "Marina: We're not fighting. I'm just telling the truth.",
        "Lizzie: What I said to your dad, it just popped out of my mouth.",
        "Marina: Oh, come on. Lizzie, you were upset because Shayne and I were having such a good time.",
        "Lizzie: Shayne? That is so yesterday's news.",
        "Marina: Okay, well, the point is that I had a beautiful shiny new red convertible until you squealed on me and now I don't have it anymore, and my dad was so mad at Ben for giving it to me that now it's being impounded.",
        "Lizzie: I didn't squeal. God, this is so boring.",
        "Tammy: Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: No. It's like being at Alston all over again. No matter what I say, the kids say opposite. No matter what I do, I'm bad or wrong or stupid. I feel like a loser.",
        "Tammy: Well, Lizzie, I mean, it's really more about Marina's car than you. I mean, would you even be mad at her if you still had it?",
        "Marina: I don't have it.",
        "Lizzie: If I got your car back, would that make things better?",
        "Tammy: Well, how would you do that? Like, pay the fine or whatever.",
        "Lizzie: Well, you shouldn't even need my help. You're the Chief's daughter. You should be able to walk into the impound and take your car back. Let's go get your car.",
        "Marina: Oh, yeah. Okay. Let's just, you know, go get my car behind the locked gate. Uh, no. My 18th birthday is tomorrow. I really don't need to be getting in any more trouble.",
        "Tammy: Yeah. Not a good idea.",
        "Lizzie: You won't get in any trouble. Do you have any spare keys?",
        "Marina: Yeah.",
        "Lizzie: Well, I'll drive us up to the impound lot on Mountain Road. I know exactly where it's at.",
        "Marina: And what? We're just going to walk in and get my car? How exactly are you planning on pulling this off?",
        "Lizzie: I'll tell you on the way. Come on.",
        "Tammy: Oh. Uh, I really don't think this is such a good idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Here, try this. I know it's cold.",
        "Shayne: Thanks.",
        "Reva: Oh, hi. I'll be right back. I've got to talk to you.",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Reva: Frank said that you quit the force.",
        "Harley: Uh, yeah.",
        "Reva: Well, you must have been pretty angry to take that kind of step.",
        "Harley: Well, you know, Frank-- because he's Chief now-- told me that I wasn't allowed to work with Gus anymore. I mean, he gave me an ultimatum, so I...",
        "Reva: Oh. Wow. So, how does it feel so far?",
        "Harley: It feels great. You know? I've been thinking about this for a long time. And now I won't have to juggle baby-sitting and stakeouts, you know? I can actually cook a meal instead of picking something up on my way home in the middle of the night. When my children wake up in the morning, I can play with them instead of rushing off to work. No. It'll be great. It's going to be great. However, I'm not really sure if things between me and Frank will be right again.",
        "Reva: This caused that much damage?",
        "Harley: We are being pulled in different directions and I feel like the thing that was holding us together just broke.",
        "Reva: Well, you know something? You're sitting here very calmly having this wonderful little talk with me and I would suggest maybe you have that little talk with Frank. Give it a try.",
        "Harley: That's actually why I came.",
        "Reva: Uh-huh. Go for it.",
        "Harley: Now?",
        "Reva: Yeah. Good luck.",
        "Harley: Thanks. (Clears throat)",
        "Frank: I knew you'd come over here and blast me one more time.",
        "Harley: You know, Frank, if you drop the sarcasm, you might actually get an apology from me.",
        "Frank: Are you asking for your old job back?",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Frank: Fine.",
        "Harley: Frank.",
        "Frank: I already have one hot-headed cop who doesn't listen to me. I don't need another one.",
        "Harley: Right. Better to have a bunch of mindless drones who go 100% by the book day in and day out, everyday, all the time. Now, that's law enforcement.",
        "Frank: My God, you're sounding like him already.",
        "Harley: And you know what you sound like, Frank? Ever since you got that gold braid on your cap, you sound like somebody who values control over judgment. Well, maybe your judgment isn't so hot.",
        "Frank: You want to talk about judgment? Fine. You've been making some lousy calls lately.",
        "Harley: What, like quitting?",
        "Frank: Like quitting.",
        "Harley: Well, I just assumed you wouldn't need somebody with my attitude on the force anyway.",
        "Frank: Well, you can change your attitude.",
        "Harley: If I did change my attitude, you'd be the last one to know. I don't... I don't want it to be like this.",
        "Frank: I know that.",
        "Harley: I love him, Frank. I do. And I love who I am and how I feel when I'm with him.",
        "Frank: You see? That's exactly where the trouble is.",
        "Harley: No. Maybe as the Chief, you have to see it as trouble.",
        "Frank: I am responsible for an entire department, not to mention the safety of this town.",
        "Harley: Well, that's got to be a lot of work.",
        "Frank: It is a lot of work. You know what, sis? I don't think we can get past this because there's a huge wall between us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: And that pick-off play in the seventh inning, that was a thing of beauty, son. I mean, you got that guy leaning off the back and bang, you nailed him.",
        "Reva: Hey. You know what I found beautiful about the seventh inning?",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Reva: The stretch.",
        "Josh: Oh, funny.",
        "Reva: Now let's stretch at home. What do you say? Can you grab my bag?",
        "Josh: Ouch. Oh, yeah.",
        "Agent Petito: There's the man of the hour. Hey, hey, hey! Jack Petito.",
        "Josh: The agent.",
        "Agent Petito: Mr. Lewis, your boy pitched quite a game tonight.",
        "Josh: Well, you know, it's a funny thing, that happens every time he has a baseball in his hands.",
        "Agent Petito: Yeah, well, if that's true, he's going to make your retirement very comfortable.",
        "Reva: I'm Shayne's mother.",
        "Josh: Oh, yeah. Sorry. This is my wife, Reva.",
        "Agent Petito: A pleasure. Listen, I don't mean to interrupt a family celebration, but at some point, I'd like to sit down with you and talk about Shayne's future.",
        "Josh: How about right now?",
        "Reva: Uh, actually, we were just getting ready to take our little C.Y. Young home and put him to bed.",
        "Agent Petito: You know, I represent three of the last seven C.Y. Young winners?",
        "Josh: Really?",
        "Agent Petito: Uh-huh.",
        "Josh: We don't have to leave right now, do we?",
        "Reva: It's late.",
        "Agent Petito: You know, it is. But if you're going home, I could always tag along.",
        "Josh: I think that's a great idea. You know, there's no better time to start planning for the future than the present. Come on, let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Ooh, look. There's my car!",
        "Lizzie: In five minutes, you'll be driving it out of here.",
        "Tammy: I really don't think we ought to do this.",
        "Lizzie: There's nothing to it. You've got the keys.",
        "Marina: Yeah.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, you're going to hop this fence and pull the car to the gate. Now, the gate will open from the inside. Just boogie back to town as fast as you can and park it behind my family's stable for a couple of days.",
        "Marina: Just until I turn 18.",
        "Lizzie: And by that time, Ben will have the title turned over in your name, so when we discover the car, you'll be completely legit. It's simple. Now, I'll give you a boost.",
        "Tammy: What are you going to do?",
        "Lizzie: Stay here. Just in case someone comes.",
        "Marina: Look, Tammy, come on. It's not that high. It'll be fine.",
        "Tammy: What are we going to do if someone does come?",
        "Lizzie: Would you get going?",
        "Marina: Tammy, come on!",
        "Cop: Hey! What are you doing here? Are you all right?",
        "Lizzie: I wasn't until now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: The moon was beautiful tonight. I had a great time. Good night. (Knock at door) Before, I thought that you were getting choked up.",
        "Edmund: No.",
        "Cassie: What were you thinking about?",
        "Edmund: I was a very young boy when I first saw Aguilera Crest. Growing up with Richard, Cassie, he was the earth-- solid and stable. And I was the sun, just circling around him day after day, burning up with jealousy. I lost my focal point, Cassie. I just... I feel as if we're adrift in a big, empty sky.",
        "Cassie: I don't feel sorry for you. For one thing, the earth revolves around the sun. For another thing, you've come along way from that jealous little brother. Especially now. Richard would...",
        "Edmund: Please finish that thought, Cassie. Richard what?",
        "Cassie: He might be proud. And I surely thought that was impossible. But now I'm not so sure. It just goes to show you that it's never too late. Speaking of late, I'm going to turn in.",
        "Edmund: Right. Sleep well.",
        "Cassie: Thank you. Edmund? Are your lights out, or am I getting special treatment?",
        "Edmund: Look out your window, Cassie. The power seems to be out all over this part of the island.",
        "Cassie: The phone's dead! Did you hear me?",
        "Edmund: Yeah, hold on. I'm looking for some matches. I've got a candle.",
        "Cassie: We still have the moon. (Knocks at door)",
        "Edmund: Cassie?",
        "Cassie: Yeah?",
        "Edmund: I've got a candle for you.",
        "Cassie: Um, I'm just going to go to bed. I'm okay.",
        "Edmund: Couldn't hurt to have a candle, just in case.",
        "Cassie: I'm fine.",
        "Edmund: You know, I really think if you had a...",
        "Cassie: It's okay, Edmund. I'm okay. Good night.",
        "Edmund: Good night.",
        "Cassie: Oh, my God!",
        "Edmund: Cassie?",
        "Cassie: Oh, my God!",
        "Edmund: Cassie?",
        "Cassie: Edmund!",
        "Edmund: Cassie!",
        "Cassie: Oh, my God.",
        "Edmund: Cassie!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Officer, I'm so glad to see you.",
        "Cop: What's the problem?",
        "Lizzie: See, I got lost driving around, and then I pulled over to use my cell phone and my car just stalled and I couldn't get it started again.",
        "Cop: Not a good night, huh?",
        "Lizzie: Could have been worse. You might not have been here.",
        "Cop: What's your name, Miss?",
        "Lizzie: Marah Lewis.",
        "Cop: Well, Marah Lewis, I think I can give you a hand.",
        "Lizzie: Would you?",
        "Cop: Not a problem. I'll just have Mike open up the gate.",
        "Lizzie: That's really sweet.",
        "Cop: Where's the car?",
        "(Engine starts)",
        "Cop: What the...?",
        "(Tires squeal)",
        "Cop: Post six to dispatch. I've got a 10-3 in progress. Request units respond. I'm holding one minor for questioning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: I've been thinking a lot lately about who I am, and I'm not thrilled.",
        "Harley: Well, you're where you want to be.",
        "Frank: I never thought in a million years I'd be Police Chief, partly because I didn't think I deserved it or I wasn't ready for it. But I honestly believe that I can make a difference. I understand what it is to be a good cop and a lawbreaker. Hell, I've been both.",
        "Harley: So then what's the problem?",
        "Frank: The problem is, is I'm following everything too closely by the book. But it makes sense to me, sis. I see it. Everybody in the whole world is mad at me right now. You're mad at me, Marina's mad at me. Hell, I'm even mad at myself.",
        "Harley: Well, what do you care? You just said you're doing what you think is right.",
        "Frank: And look what happens. My first day on the job, you nearly got killed.",
        "Harley: That is not your fault, Frank. But it wasn't Gus' fault, either.",
        "Frank: I still don't agree with what he did.",
        "Harley: Then why reinstate him? I mean, if you're so going-by-the-book, why reinstate him?",
        "Frank: It wasn't my idea. I was pressured into it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Agent Petito: Mrs. Lewis, I don't blame you for being cautious. I mean, you don't know me from Adam, so let me explain how I work and how I'll work for Shayne, okay? Now, first of all, I'm not like the other agents who take on, what, 20, 30 prospects at a time.",
        "Josh: You have fewer?",
        "Agent Petito: 12, tops. So I can focus on what each of them needs most.",
        "Reva: Like a good education.",
        "Agent Petito: Uh... Right. Anyway, Shayne's got great potential as a ballplayer. I mean, he could go in the top ten of the draft.",
        "Josh: Really? You think that high?",
        "Agent Petito: If he's brought along right.",
        "Reva: By you?",
        "Agent Petito: See, as part of the overall strategy, the more valuable Shayne is, the more leverage we have to keep him from getting locked into some lousy team in a small media market.",
        "Reva: But I thought that was the point of the draft: To make sure that all teams were competitive.",
        "Agent Petito: Technically, yes, that's true. But, you know, that doesn't mean we can't use the system to a player's advantage.",
        "Josh: Well, that's exactly why he needs an agent, right?",
        "Agent Petito: Exactly. Now, if Shayne signed with me, the first thing I would do, I would get him down to a baseball camp in Florida.",
        "Reva: After graduation.",
        "Agent Petito: Oh, no, no, no, no. Right away. This week, if the pen came out.",
        "Reva: Shayne has school this week, and every week until the end of June.",
        "Agent Petito: All right, all right. Well, he can commute down to the camp on weekends until he graduates and then he can stay for good.",
        "Reva: You mean, all summer until college starts.",
        "Agent Petito: No, no. Until he's assigned to a farm club after the draft.",
        "Reva: So you're saying just skip school altogether and go straight to the pros.",
        "Josh: Yeah, that's exactly what he's saying, sweetheart, and I think we'd be foolish not to consider it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Go away! Go away!",
        "Edmund: Cassie? Cassie?",
        "Cassie: No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Get out of here! Get out of here! Oh, God!",
        "Edmund: Cassie, what's wrong?",
        "Cassie: Oh, my God. Edmund!",
        "Edmund: Cassie?",
        "Cassie: Edmund!",
        "Edmund: Cassie? (Grunts) Where is he?",
        "Cassie: It's under the bed. It's an iguana.",
        "Edmund: What?",
        "Cassie: It's the biggest one I've ever seen in San Cristobel.",
        "Edmund: An iguana, Cassie?",
        "Cassie: Do you think I'm seeing things, Edmund?",
        "Edmund: Do I need to answer that?",
        "Cassie: Well, then check out the one under the bed.",
        "Edmund: Oh, my God! Okay, let's get you out of here. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Come on. There you go. It's okay. There, see? Very happy now.",
        "Cassie: Good. Out there.",
        "Edmund: (Laughs)",
        "Cassie: Thank you. I am never going to get any sleep tonight.",
        "Edmund: I could sit up with you for a while, if you'd like.",
        "Cassie: That would be nice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Do you know who she is? Marina Cooper? Frank Cooper's daughter. You should think twice before you put that paperwork through.",
        "Cop: I do know you.",
        "Marina: Okay, look. Could you just please not call my dad? I mean, I'm sure...",
        "Lizzie: Frank will bust you so far down, you'll have a minus sign in front of your badge number if you hassle us.",
        "Cop: Put them in cell two.",
        "Marina: Okay, great. Great. He's calling my dad. Exactly what I didn't want to happen here. I am so dead.",
        "Lizzie: You're not. You're the Chief's daughter. That's as good as having a get-out-of-jail-free card. Relax. We're untouchable.",
        "Marina: You relax. I know my dad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Wait a minute. You... you gave Gus his job back because when all was said and done, you consider him an asset to the force, right?",
        "Frank: I was pretty much pushed into a corner to do it. (Cell phone rings) Hold on. Yeah, Cooper here.",
        "Cop: Chief, it's Hanley. I'm sorry to bother you this late, but we have a situation here.",
        "Frank: That's all right. What's up?",
        "Cop: Your daughter and a couple of her friends were brought in tonight.",
        "Frank: What? Why?",
        "Cop: (Sighs) Well, she, uh, was caught scaling a fence and trying to take her car out of the impound lot.",
        "Frank: Oh, God. Let me guess... No, I know. The red convertible?",
        "Cop: Yes, sir. Look, I'm sure it was just a prank. They are teens, so I just sort of filed away the paperwork. I hope that's okay.",
        "Frank: I'm on my way.",
        "Harley: What happened?",
        "Frank: That's terrific. Oh, Marina stole that car back that Ben gave her. The red convertible from the police impound lot.",
        "Harley: Oh, no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Agent Petito: Why don't I let you discuss this...",
        "Reva: There's nothing to discuss. Shayne's going to college for four years and then after graduation, he can play badminton if he wants to.",
        "Josh: Wait a minute. What if he gets hurt playing college baseball? Then what's going to happen to his pro career?",
        "Reva: He can get hurt playing in Florida, too, on those wild weekends.",
        "Josh: He can go to college and get a degree whenever he wants. This is an opportunity that's before him right here and right now. Now, didn't you used to be the one who was so spontaneous?",
        "Reva: You want spontaneity? Leave.",
        "Josh: Oh, Reva.",
        "Reva: Get out of here, now.",
        "Josh: Reva, honey.",
        "Reva: And once you get out that door, don't you ever come back. If you come within 30 feet of my son...",
        "Josh: Okay, okay.",
        "Reva: ...I'll have you hauled in for harassment.",
        "Josh: Okay. Come on, let me walk you out.",
        "Reva: I mean, if he needs an agent, it's not going to be a snake like you.",
        "Josh: Listen, you know what? I apologize. My wife is not the most rational human being on the planet.",
        "Agent Petito: It's the mother thing. I see it a lot. So, why don't you and I talk about what's best for Shayne, one on one? Man to man?",
        "Josh: That's a contract.",
        "Agent Petito: Yeah, well, like I said, I'm only interested in top prospects, but I am very interested in them. And by the way, I only take 10% commission, not the 15% some guys get.",
        "Josh: My son's name is already printed on this contract.",
        "Agent Petito: Well, I like to be prepared.",
        "Josh: I see.",
        "Agent Petito: You don't have to sign now, given your wife's issues. Read it over. Check up on me on the internet. I've got nothing to hide.",
        "Josh: (Laughs)",
        "Agent Petito: But I do have one small request.",
        "Josh: What's that?",
        "Agent Petito: Well, if another agent comes along and wants to sign you-- and somebody will-- make sure you talk to me again.",
        "Josh: Yeah. Yeah, that's fair. I see there's places here for two people to sign, so that would be me and my wife.",
        "Agent Petito: Well, all I have to do is take care of your kid's arm. You have to handle his mother. (Laughs)",
        "Josh: Well, see, if that's the case, this contract may never get signed.",
        "Agent Petito: Oh, now, don't say that. No, no, no. You've got to think positive. I'm sure the Missus could change her mind, if you change it for her.",
        "Josh: What does that mean?",
        "Agent Petito: Women understand flowers and champagne a lot better than they do baseball. So, you take her out one night. You treat her like a queen, you bring her home, you have a good time together and, then, you bring up signing the contract.",
        "Josh: So I con her?",
        "Agent Petito: You might call it \"loving persuasion.\"",
        "Josh: (Chuckles)",
        "Agent Petito: And if that doesn't work, you could always pull out the pen yourself.",
        "Josh: Forge her signature.",
        "Agent Petito: It's been done.",
        "Josh: Get off my property. I mean it. Get off my property right now. Never come back.",
        "Reva: Is he gone?",
        "Josh: Yes, he's gone.",
        "Reva: You were out there an awful long time.",
        "Josh: He had a contract.",
        "Reva: May I see it?",
        "Josh: You were right, he's a snake.",
        "Reva: There will be many more out there.",
        "Josh: I know that.",
        "Reva: Joshua, I'm sorry I flew off the handle the way I... Well, semi-flew off. But from now on, can we promise each other one thing? Can we agree that there will be no more discussion about Shayne not going to college?",
        "Josh: You won't hear any from me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I'll bet we'll be out of here in an hour. Make that two minutes. (Laughs)",
        "Frank: Hello, ladies. Did you enjoy your drive?",
        "Marina: Daddy, I am so sorry.",
        "Frank: Hey, Hanley? There seems to be some mistake here.",
        "Cop: What, sir?",
        "Frank: I actually don't see my daughter in here, because my daughter would never do anything like this in a million years. As a matter of fact, I don't recognize any of these ladies.",
        "Marina: Daddy. Daddy, you can't just leave us in here!",
        "Harley: Talk about tough love.",
        "Frank: Hanley, do me a favor. Drop all charges, okay? Just give them a couple minutes here to think about what they've done, and then I'll call the families.",
        "Cop: All right.",
        "Frank: Thanks.",
        "Harley: Nice work, Chief.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: When exactly did you say we were going to be getting out of here?",
        "Tammy: I hope never, because when we do, my mom is going to kill me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Did you say something?",
        "Edmund: No. What are you thinking about?",
        "Cassie: Beauty.",
        "Edmund: So am I.",
        "Cassie: Richard must have loved Aguilera Crest.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I think that may be just a little too remote for a library. (Laughter)",
        "Cassie: Maybe. Another drawback would be, you put a building up on something so wild and wonderful and it just changes it forever. If not ruin it, you know?",
        "Edmund: Everything changes with time.",
        "Cassie: It's just a shame that it seems like the beautiful things go first.",
        "Edmund: Like Richard?",
        "Cassie: It's weird being here without him. Richard. See, I can say his name over and over again and I could work really hard for all the causes that I know he loved, but at the end of the day, I'm still alone. And I'm tired of it, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, you won't be alone forever.",
        "Cassie: Do you know how many people have said that to me? Everyone.",
        "Edmund: Well, maybe that's because it's true.",
        "Cassie: But I'm here, now. And I'm alive. And sometimes...",
        "Edmund: Sometimes?",
        "Cassie: Sometimes I just want to be held.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, there's nothing wrong with that. You are a young, vibrant, beautiful woman and you've known great love. And you have every right to know it again, if that's what you want.",
        "Cassie: I do."
