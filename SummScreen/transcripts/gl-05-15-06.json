Coop shows Ava the ring and tells her that he might ask Lizzie to marry him. Ava is devastated. In a jet, Mallet tires to get Dinah off the island because she killed Alan-Michael. She tells him that she didn't kill him, but wanted to; he is relieved. She tells Mallet she was stopped by his love for her. He tells her that she needs to apologize to Harley.

Mallet lies and tells the policeman that Dinah Marlar left the island.",
        "Beth and Alan arrive on the island. They plan their wedding. Alan bought a white wedding gown and tells Beth he just wants to be loved by his baby's mother. She suddenly sees a two place setting on the table and the Springfield newspaper with articles on Spaulding circled in red ink. She quizzes Alan about this. While on the same island, Harley and Gus receive a fax of Phillip's picture dated 4-10-06. Harley and he decide that Phillip has been alive all along and that Alan was telling the truth the whole time. They wonder if Beth knows. After finding out that Alan and Beth are on the same island, they pay the two a visit. They tell Alan and Beth they are investigating Ross's plane crash. Harley confronts Alan with Phillip's picture. Alan tells the two to leave. Beth is confused and wants to know what Ross's death has to do with anything and that the picture is an old one. Suddenly Beth realizes the cross-word puzzles are completed in red ink, just like Phillip used to do. \"Oh, my G-d. He was here. Phillip is alive and you knew it\", Beth implores Alan. \"Where is he\", she screams. Alan tries to tell her that Harley and Gus are lying about everything. Suddenly, there is a noise at the door and all rush to it. Gus peeks through the slats to see a man walking in the hall way. A very shaken Beth exclaims, \"Phillip? Phillip\"?"

        "Coop: Got in pretty late last night.",
        "Ava: Company. Please hold.",
        "Coop: I take you must pretty tired, huh?",
        "Ava: Yeah, a little. Why are you looking at me like that? You're the one that wanted me to go out with Jerry in the first place.",
        "Coop: No, I... ( stammering )",
        "Ava: You did. You wanted me to go out with him, okay? Why are we even talking about this? You stay out of my business and I'll stay out of yours, okay?",
        "Coop: You're right. It still kills me, though.",
        "Lizzie: Hey, you. I just found the cutest highchair.",
        "Coop: Please tell me you didn't buy it?",
        "Lizzie: No, why?",
        "Coop: Well, because if you want to get it, I want to be able to pay for it. I'm working double shifts here and over at Co2, so I should be able to pay for it.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. The baby really does have the best daddy. But that... that's actually not why I'm here. Hey, Ava, what's up? You want to join us?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Welcome to my island retreat.",
        "Beth: Hmm. Can't believe I've never been here before.",
        "Alan: Well, just stick around because I've got lots of surprises for you.",
        "Beth: It's beautiful. A perfect place for a wedding.",
        "Alan: At least it is better than our last site, a mental hospital.",
        "Beth: I don't know, it had its charms. You being locked up, for instance. ( Laughs )",
        "Alan: Wait a minute. Now you didn't... you didn't really mean that, did you?",
        "Beth: No, I didn't.",
        "Alan: Well, then, I think that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.",
        "Beth: What about \"I do\"?",
        "Alan: Well, I like that. But the nicest thing you've ever said was that you're pregnant.",
        "Beth: Alan Spaulding, you are full of surprises. ( Laughing )",

        "Mallet: Harley and Gus will have to find their one way back. Now, and you talk to the pilot?",
        "Dinah: Yeah.",
        "Mallet: Good, because we've got to get you out of here. We've got to get you back to the states. It's better to turn yourself in there.",
        "Dinah: Turn myself in?",
        "Mallet: Baby, you killed somebody. You killed somebody with my gun.",
        "Dinah: I didn't shoot Alan-Michael. Check the gun yourself. I didn't fire it.",
        "Mallet: What are you talking about? You just told me you went after him. All right, you just told me that yourself.",
        "Dinah: And you didn't let me finish.",
        "Mallet: Listen. Just save it, okay? Let's get back to the states,",
        "Dinah: Honey, listen to me. Stop it!",
        "Mallet: What?",
        "Dinah: I'm still shaking. Come on, listen. I know that I shouldn't have come here, but I needed some answers. I needed some closure. Do you know how difficult it was to confront Alan-Michael about my father. But I saw him on the railing and he was holding on for dear life, and it is amazing, but I did it, I let him go.",

        "Gus: Do you think this tip is real?",
        "Harley: Chelsea was Nicole's life partner.",
        "Gus: You mean girlfriend?",
        "Harley: Girlfriend, yes. You better that hope she knows something, because or otherwise what do we have? It's a picture.",
        "Gus: Of who?",
        "Harley: I think I know why Ross died. It's Phillip.",

        "Coop: Okay, let's go.",
        "Lizzie: No, come on. I just want to chat.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, come on.",
        "Ava: I don't have time for your games right now. I'm busy.",
        "Lizzie: I know, you're a very hard worker, and I can see why Coop respects you so much.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, what is this about?",
        "Lizzie: Nothing. I don't know, okay. Maybe it's the hormones. I don't know.",
        "Ava: You know what, enough baby talk. I'm out of here.",
        "Lizzie: Ava, I just want to say thank you for being such a good sport.",
        "Ava: Can you excuse us for a second?",
        "Coop: No, I don't think so.",
        "Lizzie: We have to work this out at some point.",
        "Coop: Okay, right. I'll be over there at the first-aid kit.",
        "Ava: He's gone, what is this about?",
        "Lizzie: I just want you to sit with us, relax, hang out, you work for Coop's family.",
        "Ava: Well, I do, yes. But if I don't to get back to my customers... I don't know what you came to do...",
        "Lizzie: I know you think the worst of me. I was really horrible to you the other day.",
        "Ava: You're always horrible to me.",
        "Lizzie: I know. I'm sorry for that. I was reading this pregnancy book that my mom gave me. And it says that the baby can feel everything that I'm feeling-- jealousy, anger, hatred-- and then that made me start thinking about you. Look, okay, Ava, you fell in love with a great guy. I can't hold that against you forever. And now you're backing off, which is really cool. Look, I heard you had a date? That's good.",
        "Ava: Thanks.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, look, for my baby's sake, I'm not going to lie to you. I want Coop, and I really, really want to make him happy. And I think he would like it if I was nicer to you. He's always nice to everyone that works for my family.",
        "Ava: Oh, my gosh!",
        "Lizzie: I think we could be friends. I mean, not for a long time, but that's okay.",
        "Ava: What do you want from me?",
        "Lizzie: I want you to say you'll think about it? Don't do it for me. Do it for him.",
        "Ava: We will never be friends.",
        "Lizzie: We could. We just have to understand each other.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Why is it every time you kiss me, I feel like I should check for the knife in my back?",
        "Alan: It's only my reputation. But I can assure you that was real.",
        "Beth: Let's see. I locked you up in a cabin, I blackmailed you, I made you sign a post-nup...",
        "Alan: And I've never been more attracted or impressed.",
        "Beth: I'm not sure I know how to take that.",
        "Alan: Oh, come on, admit it. You love it when a man tells you how beautiful you are and independent and strong.",
        "Beth: And ruthless and tough.",
        "Alan: And pregnant and beautiful. Hold that thought. I have something for you. Voila.",
        "Beth: Alan. Thank you. It's beautiful. And white.",
        "Alan: Well, I mean you wore white the last time.",
        "Beth: Yes. But I was wearing my mother's lab coat and I was playing the happy bride.",
        "Alan: Well, you could be the happy bride for real if you would just let yourself.",
        "Beth: You're really excited about this wedding, aren't you?",
        "Alan: Yes, I am. And you know, you may not believe this, but Alan Spaulding is a true romantic at heart.",
        "Beth: Who would have ever guessed?",
        "Alan: You know, you and I started our marriage out as a business deal. Then we quickly moved to sparring partners, but I want us to become a husband and wife in every way.",
        "Beth: What about this little guy?",
        "Alan: I want our child to redeem the wrongs of my past as a terrible father.",
        "Beth: You know something, Alan, I don't think you need redeeming, just reloading. We are going to renew our vows. We're going to have a wonderful vacation. We're going to go back to Springfield completely united. Harley and Gus will never know what hit them. Now that, that deserves a kiss. That was the plan, wasn't it, Alan?",
        "Alan: Maybe... maybe we should rethink that plan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: I didn't let him go off the balcony. I let him go as in laying that gun down and telling him to get lost.",
        "Mallet: Are you saying that Alan-Michael is alive?",
        "Dinah: Yes.",
        "Mallet: Oh, man. Oh, oh. I thought...",
        "Dinah: I know. I know. I wanted to, and I almost did, but I didn't.",
        "Mallet: Oh, babe! I should take you in my arms and tell you how grateful I am. Man, what were you thinking? Come on, you took my gun and you ran away and you tried to chase down the guy that you thought killed your father. That's not just crazy. That's crazy and stupid.",
        "Dinah: I know, and I'm sorry.",
        "Mallet: For what? Doing it or lying to me?",
        "Dinah: For all of it. Not trusting you. What's going on in my head, not telling you that.",
        "Mallet: How about next time?",
        "Dinah: You don't get it. There's not going to be a next time.",
        "Mallet: I hope not.",
        "Dinah: The reason I did not pull that trigger is because of something bigger than that. I didn't... I wouldn't let Alan-Michael push me that far.",
        "Mallet: What stopped you?",
        "Dinah: You. It was you.",

        "Harley: He looks pretty good for a dead guy!",
        "Gus: The picture doesn't mean anything.",
        "Harley: He's in this room.",
        "Gus: It could be a picture made to look his this.",
        "Harley: Or a room made to look this, that's true.",
        "Gus: The picture was definitely taken before Alan shot him.",
        "Harley: That could be true, except that says room 406, which you know... a month ago?",
        "Gus: Okay, so people don't set their cameras wrong? You've never taken a picture from eight years ago?",
        "Harley: That's true. That's true. It could be somebody making it look like a lie.",
        "Gus: Exactly. Can we please not go down this road again, please?",
        "Harley: Can we just go down this road for 30 seconds? Just what if, just what it Phillip was not killed? That is the perfect motive for a very real, very recent murder.",
        "Gus: What if you just put a few more ifs in that sentence. Do you hear yourself?",
        "Harley: Honey, it all makes sense. It all makes sense. Ross' P.I. had this picture. She knew Phillip was alive, which means Ross knew Phillip was alive.",
        "Gus: It doesn't make any sense. Ross loved him like a son. If he knew he was alive, he would have tried to get him home.",
        "Harley: What if that is why Ross was here, to try to get Phillip to go home? Only somebody didn't want that. Somebody wanted to make sure that Phillip never got home no matter what. We have to figure out who.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: See, it's not that hard to have a little girl time.",
        "Ava: What do you want from me?",
        "Lizzie: I want to know how you feel, okay? I want to know if you and Coop and what's...",
        "Ava: We're friends. That's it. End of story.",
        "Lizzie: Really?",
        "Ava: Really.",
        "Lizzie: That wasn't so hard. I feel better now, and hopefully you do, too.",
        "Coop: ( Clears throat ) Is everything okay over here?",
        "Ava: Ask her.",
        "Lizzie: It was good.",
        "Ava: You know what, I have seven orders to take care of.",
        "Coop: Um, what was that about?",
        "Lizzie: I swear. It's a good, okay. No big deal.",
        "Coop: Look, I'll be right back, okay?",
        "Lizzie: Okay.",
        "Coop: Hey, let me give you a hand here.",
        "Ava: No, I'm fine. I got it.",
        "Coop: I'm just looking out for my dad's plates and the laps of our customers. Listen, Lizzie says it's all good. I'm not really sure that I believe her.",
        "Ava: It doesn't matter. All she wanted me to do is assure her at you and I are just friends. And we are friends, right?",
        "Coop: Friends?",
        "Ava: Yes, we're all friends. She is having your baby and everything is right in the world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Their friends. Just friends.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: When I held that gun in my hand, my entire life passed before me. All of the pain, all of the lousy choices. When I killed Hart and played princess Cassie, I can't explain to you how hard I have worked to turn my life around and to put everything behind me. Sometimes I don't even know if I am completely away from that dark place that felt like home to me. But then I feel something. I don't know, it's this little voice, it's this little voice inside of me and it could be my conscience coming back to life. I don't know, but I do know that you make me hear that voice stronger and clearer, and I can hear it. You, Mallet. You, the guy that actually makes me believe that we could have a future. The one that throws words around like \"truth\" and \"honesty,\" and believes them. You, the guy who tells me he loves me, and who I love. You have given me a glimpse of a life that I have always dreamed of, and I thank you for that, and I would never-- I couldn't let Alan-Michael take that away from me.",
        "Mallet: Do you really mean that?",
        "Dinah: With all of my heart. With all of my heart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Daddy, do me a favor, just let the kids sleep with you tonight. Because I want you to. I know they kick. It's one night, you'll survive. Do this for me, please. I'll explain when I get home. Thank you.",
        "Gus: Don't freak out on me.",
        "Harley: What else would you have me do? If Phillip is alive, I want to be prepared.",
        "Gus: First thing we've got to do is get a real photo, okay? It's too easy to doctor a photo.",
        "Harley: Okay. But I want to be prepared in the meantime. Because if he is alive, it means he could still be going after me, which means he could do something to the kids.",
        "Gus: If he was alive, and he was going to do something, he would've done it by now. He would have done something to us.",
        "Harley: But you do think he is alive?",
        "Gus: No. I'm just saying we have to check out all of the angles, that would be the right thing to do.",
        "Harley: You understand why we can't let our guard down. We have to protect our family. This guy was going to let me rot in jail for a murder I didn't do, and also that never happened. I'm the mother of his child.",
        "Gus: That's sick.",
        "Harley: I could have been in prison for years. When I find this guy, he will wish he stayed dead.",
        "Gus: The problem is, if he's alive, he must have help from Alan.",
        "Harley: Which means Alan is telling the truth. Do you think Beth knows?",
        "Gus: Of course not. Do you think she would marry Alan knowing that Phillip was alive someplace?",
        "Harley: That's a very good point.",
        "Gus: I've got to make a call. Hilda, hey, it's Gus. Is my father there? Can I talk to him? He isn't? Where is he? Where? Okay. Thanks. You don't have to tell him I called. Thanks. Let's go.",
        "Harley: Wait a minute. We can't leave until we hear from Mallet.",
        "Gus: Who said anything about leaving the island? Alan's here. For all we know, Phillip is with him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: When you kept me in that cabin, you not only opened my eyes about you, you opened my eyes about a lot of things. I realized that not one of my sons wants anything to do with me. And it's all my fault. I've been selfish, ruthless, and narrow-minded. And I put the company ahead of everything else. Now, I convinced myself I was doing it for the family. Maybe in truth I was, but I am certainly paying a very high price.",
        "Beth: You were going after what you want. And isn't that what you like about me now?",
        "Alan: Yes. But my values were all wrong. I lost the company, and I lost my family because of that. And I lost my future until now, until you told me that you were pregnant. Now, I finally have another chance, another chance to be the father that I haven't been. I want that this child, our child, to respect me for who I am. To admire me. If he or she wants to be a part of the company, I want it to be because they want to, not because I make them. Does any of that make sense?",
        "Beth: You want to be loved.",
        "Alan: Yes. I want to be loved by this child and by this child's mother.",
        "Beth: You are loved. You are loved. That's strange.",
        "Alan: What?",
        "Beth: I didn't notice that before. So I know how the three bears felt. Somebody's been here. Somebody's been at our house.",

        "Beth Elhers \"Inside The Light.\" I like being a blond. I think it's my personality. If I wasn't an actor, I wanted to do something with medicine, particularly with childbirth. My first acting job was for PBS, and it was a little movie they ended up describing to college campuses about safe sex and using condoms. I was ten years old, by the time I got to college they were still showing it, and I was known as that for about a week on campus. Isn't that that little girl in the condom movie? See Harley, Wednesday, May 17 \"Inside The Light.\"",

        "Lizzie: Okay, it's barely two carats, and there's a slight flaw. Oh, but who cares? It's from Coop, obviously. I am doing something right. Okay, getting pregnant by Jonathan was pretty stupid, but who's going to know? Oh, my God! I am going to be Mrs. Henry Cooper Bradshaw!",
        "Ava: No, I cannot do this right now, okay?",
        "Lizzie: I hope I didn't say something that upset her.",
        "Coop: No, no, she's fine.",
        "Lizzie: You know that you really can tell me anything.",
        "Coop: Yeah, um... you know what? We do need to talk. But not here, not here. Are you free later?",
        "Lizzie: Um... yeah, I could free up my schedule. Dinner?",
        "Coop: Yeah, sure. But someplace quiet, though, please.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, you just took the words right out of my mouth. I'm going to need a little bit of time. I've got to change, something a little bit more appropriate for the club.",
        "Coop: The club? The club?",
        "Lizzie: Come on! It's my treat.",
        "Coop: No, Lizzie, you don't have to...",
        "Lizzie: No... yes, yes, yes, I insist.",
        "Coop: Okay, fine, sure.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, um... so pick me up at 7:00, and it's a date. It's not a date. It's just dinner. Yeah, okay. Um... I will see you. Bye.",
        "Coop: Ava, look, I'm sorry...",
        "Ava: It's... it's... it's... um, no, I'm dating, you're having a baby, and that's just the way it is.",

        "Dinah: I act like I am.",
        "Mallet: Alan-Michael's alive because you chose to let him stay that way. You knew it was wrong, so you can't put this on me. This is all about you.",
        "Dinah: You sound like you're channeling my daddy.",
        "Mallet: That's not so bad, is it?",
        "Dinah: No. You forgive me?",
        "Mallet: Why don't you tell me the rest?",
        "Dinah: The rest?",
        "Mallet: Why'd you let him go?",
        "Dinah: I told you.",
        "Mallet: No, you told me why you didn't kill him. You didn't tell me why you didn't let him go. You would have hung on to him, called the police, waited for them to show up. What if he did set up Ross's plane?",
        "Dinah: I don't care anymore.",
        "Mallet: Does Alan-Michael have something on you? Huh? Does he?",
        "Dinah: Mallet, it's not the reason that I let him go. Before I figured out that he was involved with my dad's death, we made an agreement.",
        "Mallet: What did you agree to?",
        "Dinah: To partner up and take over Spaulding.",
        "Mallet: Where would that leave Harley?",
        "Dinah: Out.",
        "Mallet: Out? So let me get this straight: The whole time you were working with Harley, you were plotting with Alan-Michael to kick her to the curb?",
        "Dinah: Not the whole time.",
        "Mallet: Not the whole time? What, a little bit of the time? Maybe half the time, almost full time, what... what were you doing here?",
        "Dinah: Mallet, listen to me. Alan-Michael came to me many times to partner up with me, and I turned him down.",
        "Mallet: Oh, what, did he sweeten the deal?",
        "Dinah: This isn't about Alan- Michael. This is about Harley.",
        "Mallet: Oh, so you're saying this is Harley's fault?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. No, I... look, I don't know why but I felt like I was being taken... I don't know, taken for granted, I guess, okay? Do you even understand how it feels to be unappreciated?",
        "Mallet: Come on, Dinah, she entrusted you enough to let you have her job!",
        "Dinah: Yeah, and then she yanked it away.",
        "Mallet: That's not how it was.",
        "Dinah: Well, that's how it felt.",
        "Mallet: What the hell is wrong with you? Harley gave you a second chance when nobody in town would even look your way. I would say that's a pretty friendly thing to do.",
        "Dinah: Friends don't sleep with the guy you're in love with.",
        "Mallet: ( Sighs ) Is this partnership with Alan- Michael, is that over?",
        "Dinah: Done. Mallet... I don't know. I feel like when daddy's crash happened, it was like payback for everything I was doing to Harley. I mean, talk about karma.",
        "Mallet: You didn't cause Ross' death.",
        "Dinah: How can you be so sure?",
        "Mallet: Because I'm pretty sure. Well, I guess I know how you can make it up to me.",
        "Dinah: How?",
        "Mallet: You're not going to like it.",
        "Dinah: I don't care. I'll do anything.",
        "Mallet: All right. Let's go. Come on. Grab your purse.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Look at this. These are all copies of the \"Springfield Journal.\"",
        "Alan: Well, I do have a subscription sent down here, but if it upsets you, Beth, I'll tell the household to not let them to accumulate, that's all.",
        "Beth: No, no, it's not that.",
        "Alan: Well, then, what is it?",
        "Beth: I don't know, but... well, look. It's like somebody has been waiting here for us.",
        "Alan: Beth, Beth, sweetheart, I think your hormones are making you a little paranoid right now.",
        "Beth: Oh, come on! Look at this, look at this: Every time Spaulding is mentioned, it's been circled.",
        "Alan: This is a Spaulding house.",
        "Beth: You don't find that this is strange.",
        "Alan: Well, I'm sure that there's a simple explanation for it.",
        "Gus: Or a not-so-simple explanation.",
        "Alan: What are you two doing here?",
        "Gus: It's nice to see you, too, Dad.",
        "Harley: What's wrong, Beth? Wow! Someone is awfully interested in the goings- on at home. You see this? Any explanations, Alan?",
        "Alan: Just the household staff, Harley, and I was explaining it to Beth.",
        "Gus: How are his explanations going so far?",
        "Beth: I just want to know what you're doing here.",
        "Gus: We're down here trying to find some answers about Ross's plane crash.",
        "Alan: Ah, the dynamic duo at it again, huh? Haven't you two learned anything by now?",
        "Harley: Maybe. Maybe something that could help to explain your unexpected visitor. Why don't you tell her, Alan? Why don't you tell all of us? Phillip is alive, isn't he?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Nana!",
        "Lillian: Hi, honey.",
        "Lizzie: Hey, what are you doing here?",
        "Lillian: Well, I came to see you. I came across this box today, all these baby things I'd made you. Look at these little booties. Aren't they darling?",
        "Lizzie: They're so cute. Is mom here?",
        "Lillian: Didn't she tell you? She and your grandfather went off on a little jaunt to the islands.",
        "Lizzie: Today?",
        "Lillian: This morning.",
        "Lizzie: Oh. I wanted to tell her something.",
        "Lillian: Can't tell me?",
        "Lizzie: I guess I could. Okay, Nana, everything that I have ever hoped for is coming true.",

        "Ava: There you go.",
        "Coop: Ava, sorry...",
        "Ava: You know what? I don't have time right now, okay? So just... stop it. Come on, snap out of it. Stop walking around like a sick puppy here.",
        "Coop: Gee, thank you very much. I appreciate that.",
        "Ava: Look, don't feel guilty, okay? I'm fine. We're fine. We're still friends. We started out as friends. We're all good.",
        "Coop: Then tell me why I still feel so lousy about this whole thing?",
        "Ava: Because you're a nice guy, okay? And you want to make sure that everything's okay for everybody, but sometimes it's not possible. We can just be friends, it's fine. I'll look at your baby pictures, I'll tell you about my dates, and eventually we'll forget that there was ever anything more between us. We'll be friends.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I mean, the ring, our date tonight, it all adds up. Coop is going to ask me to marry him tonight.",
        "Lillian: It certainly sounds like it.",
        "Lizzie: You're happy for me, right?",
        "Lillian: Well, of course I am, sweetie.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, well, don't ruin this, okay?",
        "Lillian: I'm not trying to ruin anything.",
        "Lizzie: Good, because then you can come with me to go buy some bridal magazines.",
        "Lillian: Okay, but first I just have to ask you one question. Do you think that Coop is going to ask you to marry him because he loves you or because he feels some sort of obligation to the baby?",
        "Lizzie: He loves me. And I love him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: What you and I had, it was... it was... you just have to do the right thing. That's what makes you you.",
        "Coop: So... we're friends?",
        "Ava: Absolutely. Want to hear about my date?",
        "Coop: Nope.",
        "Ava: Sure, you do.",
        "Coop: Fine, fine. Just... it's a band-aid. Tear it often, make it quick, tell me.",
        "Ava: My date, well, he was cute and nice, and he kissed me at the end of the date.",
        "Coop: Yeah, I saw that part.",
        "Ava: Oh. Okay, your turn.",
        "Coop: Right, um... I kind of need that friend to talk to right now.",
        "Ava: Okay.",
        "Coop: I bought something for Lizzie.",

        "Police chief: Mr. Mallet!",
        "Mallet: Hey, Chief. How're you doing? Uh, this is...",
        "Police chief: Do you know a Mr. Alan-Michael Spaulding?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, yeah, we're all from the same town.",
        "Police chief: He's at my headquarters.",
        "Dinah: Really?",
        "Police chief: It seems he was threatened at gunpoint.",
        "Dinah: Wow.",
        "Police chief: I have a warrant for Dinah Marler's arrest.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: I want you two to take your wild accusations and leave. We're preparing for a wedding.",
        "Gus: You mean a joke of a wedding. Let me ask you something, Dad. How do you explain this?",
        "Alan: That's a photo of Phillip.",
        "Harley: Taken at the grand hotel on this island-- beautiful rooms.",
        "Beth: This doesn't make any sense.",
        "Harley: Look at the date.",
        "Beth: It's obviously wrong. Isn't that right...",
        "Harley: Actually, it's not. Tell her, Alan.",
        "Beth: Alan?",
        "Alan: I want you to leave.",
        "Harley: You already said Phillip was alive.",
        "Alan: I said that to stay out of prison and you know it, Harley.",
        "Harley: And you let me go to prison for something that never even happened. You kept me away from my kids...",
        "Alan: I want you to leave or I'm going to call the police.",
        "Harley: We will wait for them to come! We'll wait for them.",
        "Alan: You have ruined this night. Thank you very much, Harley. Come, Beth. Beth?",
        "Beth: This crossword puzzle.",
        "Harley: What? What is it?",
        "Beth: It's done in red ink. Phillip always did his crossword puzzles red ink. This is his handwriting. Oh, my God! He was here! Phillip is alive, and you knew it! Where is he?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Wow. It's beautiful. Lizzie's going to love it.",
        "Coop: You think so?",
        "Ava: Yeah. It's amazing. When are you going to give it to her?",
        "Coop: I almost did yesterday. But I had a talk with my mom, and basically she said to follow my heart, do what it was telling me.",
        "Ava: So are you going to propose tonight?",
        "Coop: I don't know.",
        "Ava: Hey, you're looking at me like you want me to give you a reason not to do this, and I'm not going to do that. I don't want you to grow to resent me because you can't see your baby.",
        "Coop: Ava, I would never resent you...",
        "Ava: No. You could. You could, okay? Do what you need to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lillian: Honey, I know you love him. I mean, you've always worn your heart right there on your sleeve. I just don't want to see you get hurt.",
        "Lizzie: Coop isn't going to hurt me. He's a good guy.",
        "Lillian: I know he is. That's why I'm...",
        "Lizzie: Why is it that all of you want me to be as miserable as you are? Look, I'm sorry, Nana, I'm not going to end up alone like you.",
        "Lillian: There are worse things in the world than being alone.",
        "Lizzie: I know. I could end up like daddy. I mean, look, he looked so happy here.",
        "Lillian: Oh, he was.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, and then it all changed. He died so mad at the world, and hated, feared by everyone. That is not going to happen to me, and it's not going to happen to my baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Well, thanks, Chief. I appreciate that, and I believe me, I know this woman Dinah Marler, and she's long gone. You don't have to worry about her coming back to the island.",
        "Dinah: Thank you. Thank you.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, you're welcome. We don't need the hassle.",
        "Dinah: No, no... okay, so you... you care what happens to me.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, a little bit. Of course I do. I kind of love you. I'm a little pissed at you, though, but you're starting to do the right thing.",
        "Dinah: So, um, what happens now?",
        "Mallet: You have to go apologize to someone.",
        "Dinah: You mean Harley?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, yeah, so let's go and get that over with, okay? So once and for all we can finally just get on with our life. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Beth, they're lying. You know them.",
        "Beth: You have told so many stories, I don't know what is true anymore. Phillip was dead, Phillip was alive, Harley was the killer, you were the killer. Which is it, Alan? What is the truth?",
        "Alan: He's dead.",
        "Beth: Then explain this.",
        "Alan: They've obviously altered it, that's all.",
        "Beth: You're lying to me!",
        "Alan: How dare you come in here and upset the mother of my child, Harley!",
        "Harley: Me? You did this. You knew Phillip was alive and you kept quiet. You are the reason that Ross is dead.",
        "Alan: Oh, yes, yes, I put on my pilot cap and crashed the plane myself.",
        "Beth: What are you talking about? How is Ross connected to Phillip?",
        "Harley: Ross's P.I. found out that Phillip was alive, and somebody wanted to keep him quiet.",
        "Beth: Oh, my God.",
        "Alan: Beth, you can't take these two seriously.",
        "Beth: Phillip? Phillip?",
        "Gus: Wait a second. Make sure he doesn't get away.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Lizzie: Where's the ring? Okay, forget it; it doesn't matter. Just ask me. I think you're really going to like the answer.",
        "Jeffrey: Phillip had someone working for him, and I'm expecting a call any minute now from my assistant with a name.",
        "Beth: You didn't have anything to do with Ross' death, did you?"
