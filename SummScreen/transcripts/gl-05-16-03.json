        "Phillip: Well, I don't care what my father told you. I am the CEO of Spaulding Enterprises, and that letter will go out with my signature on it, not his. Thank you. Copy me on that. Unbelievable. Alan's calling secretaries at home now, trying to strong-arm me. You think that's funny?",
        "Olivia: No, I... What, does that surprise you?",
        "Phillip: You know what? There's a little part of me that would like to just say the hell with all this. I'd like to just let him have the company and let him run it with his long-lost son, Gus. It's not worth the gray hair I'm getting from this.",
        "Olivia: The gray hair?",
        "Phillip: Yeah.",
        "Olivia: No. First of all, they were already there. Second, Spaulding isn't just a company; it's your family. And third, we don't know that Gus is Alan's son. Neither does Alan. He doesn't know that Gus is his son unless he had some kind of DNA test run and we don't know about it.",
        "Phillip: I think he would have gleefully sprung that information on me.",
        "Olivia: Okay, so it's all conjecture at this point.",
        "Phillip: Well, maybe it is, but I will need to know the truth soon enough, because I don't like uncertainty. I don't deal with it well.",
        "Olivia: I had no idea.",
        "Phillip: I think I may know who can give me some of these answers.",
        "Olivia: Really? Who? Phillip?",
        "Phillip: I'll see you back at the loft.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Did you get a hold of my mom and dad?",
        "Frank: Not yet, Lizzie. Yours either, Tammy. It seems that everybody's turning their phones off tonight.",
        "Lizzie: Harley...",
        "Harley: Okay. I think it's time to let them out of the cell. They feel bad enough.",
        "Frank: I can't do that. They stole a car.",
        "Harley: But didn't you just tell me that you needed to find another approach with Marina because the whole tough love thing wasn't working?",
        "Frank: I told Hanley to drop charges, okay? I mean, look. Their parents are going to be here soon enough, and we can wrap this baby up. I don't think we should let them off this easily.",
        "Harley: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Marina's parent is right here, Frank.",
        "Frank: No.",
        "Harley: Why not?",
        "Frank: Because I can't play favorites, sis. That's why. What is going on here? What's happening? How am I here? I mean, I... I feel like I'm losing my little girl.",
        "Harley: Well, then, let her out of the cell.",
        "Frank: No. She's got to see that there are consequences for her actions.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: No, no, no. You called the right person, and I appreciate it. Okay. Thanks a lot. Bye.",
        "Mayor: Jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: Ah, Mr. Mayor. What brings you here?",
        "Mayor: Obligatory dinner with some constituents. Can I buy you a nightcap?",
        "Jeffrey: No, no, no, no, no. Thanks. I'll take a rain check. Something came up downtown; I want to handle it myself.",
        "Mayor: Something important?",
        "Jeffrey: It's just three teenage girls tried to steal a car from the impound lot, and they're the daughters of some well-connected, well-to-do Springfield residents, so I thought I would make sure that the paperwork didn't mysteriously get lost, if you know what I mean.",
        "Mayor: No, wait, wait, wait. Why did they go all the way out to the impound to steal a car?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, apparently one of the girls thought that the car was hers, and she thought that it was also unfairly impounded. It's kind of complicated.",
        "Mayor: So the girl was trying to get her own car back, and her friends helped.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, that's the gist of it.",
        "Mayor: Sounds like a simple prank to me.",
        "Jeffrey: Mr. Mayor, you brought me to Springfield to do a job, right? And that job is to make sure that justice is applied, and that the law is applied evenly and fairly to everyone, even well-connected Springfield residents. I want to make sure that these girls and their parents know that that's a fact.",
        "Mayor: Jeff...",
        "Jeffrey: Now, just so you know-- and I'm going to give you a heads-up here-- one of the daughters is Chief Cooper's daughter. So, is there a problem?",
        "Mayor: There is, actually.",
        "Jeffrey: Now, listen. You've got to give me the authority and the autonomy to take care of these matters. I can't have political interference every time I try to do something.",
        "Mayor: Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, relax. My problem isn't with the way you're handling the situation. My problem is with the way you look.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Phone rings)",
        "Cassie: That could be the sitter. (Phone rings) Hello?",
        "Frank: Cassie?",
        "Cassie: Frank?",
        "Frank: Listen, there's nothing to worry about. Nobody's hurt.",
        "Cassie: What's up? What's going on?",
        "Frank: Tammy's in a bit of trouble. It seems that Marina and Lizzie Spaulding were arrested tonight.",
        "Cassie: Arrested?",
        "Frank: Yeah, they tried to steal back Marina's car from the police impound.",
        "Cassie: Oh, my God. Why would they do something so crazy? Tammy helped Marina and Lizzie steal a car.",
        "Frank: Marina's trying to make a misguided point to me, and the other two helped, so technically it's grand theft auto.",
        "Cassie: No. You can't be serious.",
        "Frank: We're trying to keep the paperwork out of the system. Hopefully the D.A. will be out of it, so...",
        "Cassie: Please, please, Frank, you've got to keep him out of this.",
        "Frank: We have another small problem-- that is that Tammy's underage, so I'm going to have to release her to the custody of a legal guardian or parent. Would you like me to call Josh or Reva, or do you have somebody else in mind?",
        "Cassie: No. I will be there to pick up my daughter.",
        "Frank: You're going to come all the way back from San Cristobel?",
        "Cassie: What would you do if it were your daughter?",
        "Frank: See you soon.",
        "Cassie: Thanks. I've got to go home, and I've got to get Tammy out of jail.",
        "Edmund: All right, all right.",
        "Cassie: I don't even know what time it is. What time is it? I mean, is there going to be a flight that I can get back to Springfield right now?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, don't worry about that. I know people at the airport. I can charter us a jet.",
        "Cassie: Us? What do you mean, \"us\"? No. You've got to stay here. You've got to find the location for the memorial. You've got to stay here and do everything that we planned, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, Cassie, I'm not taking my eyes off you tonight. I am taking you back to Springfield whether you like it or not. So get dressed, and I'm going to call the airport.",
        "Cassie: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Now, hey, hey, hey. Wait a minute, Mr. Mayor. What do you mean, the way I look? What's wrong with the way I look?",
        "Mayor: Your appearance. Your beard.",
        "Jeffrey: My beard? What's wrong with my beard? People love my beard. Women tell me it's sexy.",
        "Mayor: Look, maybe they don't mind their D.A.'s being bearded and scraggly in New York, but here in the Midwest we like well-groomed...",
        "Jeffrey: Scraggly? What, is there a dress code now?",
        "Mayor: I thought that was implied. All my people are clean-shaven. They wear suits and ties.",
        "Jeffrey: Suits and ties? So now it's my wardrobe? You're all over my wardrobe?",
        "Mayor: And they wear shoes, Jeff. Shoes. Not those hippy-dippy sneakers.",
        "Jeffrey: You knew what you were getting when you hired me.",
        "Mayor: And you knew where you were going-- the kind of community Springfield is, and its values.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, I'll lose the beard. Maybe people will stop mistaking me for this Richard character if I do. And you want me to dress like Mr. Middle-of- the-road, well, I'll do my best. But for the record, I choose my battles, and this is the last one I plan on losing to you.",
        "Mayor: Duly noted. I need a drink.",
        "Jeffrey: Hippy-dippy shoes. Yeah, this is D.A. O'Neill. I want to speak with Chief Cooper, please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: You ladies hungry, thirsty? Can I get you something to eat or drink? Okay. You're going to be here a while. You know, sis, sometimes I really think I would really like to be on the other side of the law. It was a whole lot simpler when I had the chop shop.",
        "Harley: Oh, please. You were born to do this job. And for the most part, you're great at it, except when you let your frustration over your teenage daughter's relationship with an older guy get you so riled up that you do something stupid like impound her car, when all you had to do was give Ben a ticket for parking illegally. And then you take it a step further and you leave her in jail when she tries to get the car back.",
        "Frank: They stole the car back.",
        "Harley: Frank, it's time to let her out of the cell.",
        "Frank: I can't do that, sis.",
        "Harley: You can do whatever you want to do. You're the big guy. You're the chief of police. Hey, you waved your magic wand and got Gus' badge back.",
        "Frank: No, I didn't. That wasn't my call. I was just following orders.",
        "Harley: Okay, that's the third time you've said that. Whose orders?",
        "Frank: It doesn't matter, sis.",
        "Harley: Frank, it's me. Whose?",
        "Frank: The mayor. The mayor. And who else in Gus' life would the mayor owe a favor to?",
        "Harley: Alan pulled strings to get Gus' job back?",
        "Frank: You didn't hear that from me. Looks like big daddy's taking care of his new son.",
        "Harley: Or trying to win him over. I know Gus. This whole thing is going to backfire.",
        "Frank: You mean to tell me he doesn't know what his dad has done?",
        "Harley: Of course not. Gus hates it when big shots throw their weight around, especially the Spaulding's.",
        "Frank: All right. Well, now that you know, are you going to tell him?",
        "Harley: That's a good question.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: Hello, Reggie. You got a minute?",
        "Lucia: Phillip. Look at you. All right, who told you?",
        "Phillip: It wasn't all that hard to figure out.",
        "Lucia: Would you sit down with me for a minute? I've been meaning to get in touch with you, especially now that everything's out in the open. I bet you have a question for me.",
        "Phillip: Yeah. So is it true? Is Gus really Alan's son?",
        "Lucia: Yes. Yes, that's true.",
        "Phillip: So that's why you left the house when I was little?",
        "Lucia: Mm.",
        "Phillip: Had an affair with Alan, and he found out there was going to be a baby.",
        "Lucia: Yeah.",
        "Phillip: (Sighs) Okay, well, that's a relief.",
        "Lucia: That's a relief?",
        "Phillip: Mm. Yeah, I always figured you left because of me. Thought it was something that I did.",
        "Lucia: Oh, no, never. Are you kidding? I adored you.",
        "Phillip: So let me guess. Alan... Alan maneuvered you into bed and had his fun for a little while and then sent you packing. Fairly classic.",
        "Lucia: No. No, it wasn't really like that. If it was, things would be a lot simpler now for everybody.",
        "Phillip: What are you saying? You saying that you and my father...",
        "Lucia: Loved each other. We loved each other very much, and Gus is a product of that love-- a son that Alan never even knew he had. And now that he does, I think he wants to make up for lost time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Hey.",
        "Harley: You did the laundry?",
        "Gus: Yeah. Uh-huh. I separated all the hots from the colds and the, you know, pinks from the blacks-- everything.",
        "Harley: Well, I'm very impressed.",
        "Gus: Yeah. Where you been?",
        "Harley: Oh, I went down to Company to see if I could, you know, iron things out with Frank.",
        "Gus: Yeah?",
        "Harley: Didn't go very well. And halfway through, we got a call from Hanley saying he busted Marina.",
        "Gus: You're kidding me. Busted for what?",
        "Harley: For stealing her car back from the impound, along with two of her friends.",
        "Gus: Get out of here. God, that girl loves to test your brother.",
        "Harley: She sure does. And Frank, you know, handled it in his usual manner. He let them all sit in the tank.",
        "Gus: (Laughs) Yeah? Then he sprung them all?",
        "Harley: No, they're still in there. Yeah. I think he's allowing them bread and water.",
        "Gus: You're joking. Your brother's on a roll, let me tell you something. Good, old, by-the-book Cooper. It's a wonder the guy even changed his mind to give me back my badge at all.",
        "Harley: Well, you shouldn't give him too much credit for that.",
        "Gus: I can't believe he's leaving his daughter in the slammer. I mean, honestly, fathers are supposed to be by your side, stick, you know, with you through thick and... They're supposed to bail you out no matter what.",
        "Harley: Uh, Gus...",
        "Gus: Hmm?",
        "Harley: Frank told me something on the Q.T., and you should probably know about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ben: There you are. I've been looking all over for... You.",
        "Blake: Whoops. Wrong redhead, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Tammy, I was able to locate your mother. She's on her way back to get you.",
        "Tammy: From San Cristobel? Great, I'll be grounded for life.",
        "Lizzie: What about my mom and dad, Frank?",
        "Frank: Lizzie, I wasn't able to reach them yet, okay? But I was able to find someone else for you.",
        "Lizzie: Who, my grandfather? Aunt Alex?",
        "Cop: Chief...",
        "Olivia: Lizzie. How's it going?",
        "Lizzie: He called you?",
        "Olivia: Any port in a storm, I guess.",
        "Lizzie: Where's my dad?",
        "Olivia: I don't know.",
        "Lizzie: Well, find him, please.",
        "Olivia: That's what we're all trying to do here, Lizzie.",
        "Marina: Lizzie...",
        "Cop: Ms. Spaulding.",
        "Olivia: Yes?",
        "Cop: Hi. I'm the arresting officer.",
        "Olivia: Hi.",
        "Cop: Could I have a word with you?",
        "Olivia: Sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Why are you being so mean to Olivia? She's just trying to help you.",
        "Lizzie: Well, I don't want her. I want my parents. She's not even family-- not officially.",
        "Marina: Well, who cares, as long as she's going to get you out of here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop: When I bring in a kid Lizzie's age and they do something like this, I think it's really important to be straightforward with the families.",
        "Olivia: Yeah. No, that's fine. But you said that of the three girls, you think Lizzie is the instigator. Why would you say that?",
        "Cop: Ma'am, I've seen a lot of troubled kids, all right? And that Lizzie-- well, she likes to pull the strings. My advice would be to nip it in the bud. Okay.",
        "Olivia: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You know, Edmund, you really didn't-- thank you-- have to fly back home with me.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, we agreed to it in the car, we agreed to it in the airport, we agreed to it on the plane. My presence with you now is no longer a suitable topic for discussion.",
        "Cassie: You're right, we did agree.",
        "Edmund: And I'm not going to choose a site for Richard's library without you.",
        "Cassie: You made that clear.",
        "Edmund: And although you are a former princess, I'm a current ambassador, and therefore can pull strings with the Springfield Police Department, and you can't.",
        "Cassie: Gotcha.",
        "Edmund: Good. You know, it's not half bad to have someone in your corner pulling for you sometimes.",
        "Cassie: No, it's not half bad; it's nice. Thank you.",
        "Edmund: You're welcome.",
        "Cassie: I wish I had someone with me when Tammy was arrested before for stealing my ring.",
        "Edmund: You know, the two crimes have an uncanny similarity. In both instances, an item was taken to be returned to its rightful owner. You don't suppose that Tammy's become some sort of modern-day Robin Hood, do you?",
        "Cassie: (Laughs) That's not funny.",
        "Edmund: Then why are you smiling?",
        "Cassie: I'm not smiling; I'm gritting my teeth, trying to brace myself for what lies ahead. You know what I'm going to have to do? I have to go to the police station. I have to deal with the police. Then I have to fill out all this paperwork. And then I have to sit down with the D.A., so that he can tell me what a horrible mother I am and how my daughter is a juvenile delinquent.",
        "Edmund: The D.A.?",
        "Cassie: Yes, the District Attorney. That's the person who prosecutes people. Except this time instead of dealing with a she, I'm going to have to deal with a he. What is this new guy's name again?",
        "Edmund: Jeffrey O'Neill I hear is going to be working with Doris Wolfe.",
        "Cassie: Well, then I guess I have to deal with Jeffrey O'Neill. I just hope he's not a tyrant like Doris Wolfe.",
        "Edmund: Wait, wait, wait. Do you really think it's going to go that far? Do you think you'll have to meet with the D.A.?",
        "Cassie: I had to the last time. Don't want no secret agent don't need no long Cadillac I don't want nobody with no problems I don't need a man with a monkey on his back I want a real man I said a real man I need a real man ain't messin' with no toy I don't need no baby boy don't need to send me no flowers, babe sendin' flowers is real nice way I've been feelin' my heart's been a' reeling. I need a man to love me once I want a man to love me twice I want a real man I need a real man I want a real man I said a real man I want a real man...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: So what did your brother tell you? On the Q.T.?",
        "Harley: Yeah, it's about you getting your badge back. That wasn't exactly Frank's idea.",
        "Gus: No, I know that.",
        "Harley: You do?",
        "Gus: Yeah. Well, I mean, he as much as said it himself when he came over to deliver the news, remember?",
        "Harley: Uh-huh.",
        "Gus: I think he said he was pressured by somebody. It was probably, like, that citizen group.",
        "Harley: No, wasn't them.",
        "Gus: No?",
        "Harley: It was the mayor himself.",
        "Gus: Get out. The mayor himself? Really? Well, that's understandable. I mean, Hamilton's such a suck-up, you know. He'd do anything to get votes later on down the road, right? Who cares how it happens? It's the end result that matters. Right? Coop?",
        "Harley: Uh, yeah. But the mayor didn't just do it to get votes. He did it because you are, you know, a great detective, and he needs you to work on the coroner's homicide case.",
        "Gus: The mayor himself. I didn't even know the guy knew I was alive.",
        "Harley: (Laughs) Neither did I. Okay, I got to go.",
        "Gus: What are you talking about? You just got home.",
        "Harley: I know, but I got to go talk to my dad. I got to see if he can get through to Frank and convince him to spring poor Marina.",
        "Gus: Okay, but I... I was thinking-- I don't know-- we could...",
        "Harley: You're okay with the kids, right?",
        "Gus: ...Eat. Yeah, I'm fine. But I'll need...",
        "Harley: I love you. Thank you.",
        "Gus: On my cell.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucia: When you were a little boy, Phillip, your father was a very different man. You know, I think I met him when he was at a crossroads in his life.",
        "Phillip: Really? How so?",
        "Lucia: Well, you know that Brandon had raised him and groomed him to be C.E.O. of Spaulding Enterprises, but Alan had other aspirations for himself.",
        "Phillip: Oh, he was... He was never content with just running Spaulding. He wanted to run the world.",
        "Lucia: No. No, Alan never wanted to run the world. The only thing he wanted to do was to sing.",
        "Phillip: (Laughs) To sing?",
        "Lucia: Yes.",
        "Phillip: What?",
        "Lucia: That's right. You've never heard him sing? Oh, he has the most magnificent voice. I... I really think he could've been a professional-- I mean, Broadway or, I don't know, maybe even the opera. But Brandon told him that if he ever pursued such foolishness, he would... He'd just cut him off completely. It's true. You didn't know this?",
        "Phillip: That Alan ever dreamed of anything other than amassing as much power and money as he could? No. Never occurred to me.",
        "Lucia: No, but think about it. I mean, look at yourself. You were so artistic as a little boy. I honestly thought that you'd become some sort of a writer.",
        "Phillip: Well, actually I did.",
        "Lucia: What?",
        "Phillip: Yeah, I did. Tried my hand at it for a few years-- even got a novel published.",
        "Lucia: Good for you.",
        "Phillip: Yeah. Alan eventually sucked me back into the corporate quicksand.",
        "Lucia: It's so interesting how history repeats itself, isn't it? I mean, that's why I wanted to never let Gus know that Alan was his father, or vice versa, because I wanted my son to grow up to be his own man, to follow his own heart, and not end up like Alan.",
        "Phillip: Or me.",
        "Lucia: I'm sorry. No, I didn't mean to imply that...",
        "Phillip: No, no, no.",
        "Lucia: I'm so sorry.",
        "Phillip: It's okay. I know. Listen, you've explained an awful lot to me. Thank you.",
        "Lucia: You're welcome. Anytime.",
        "Phillip: I have to get going.",
        "Lucia: Mm-hmm.",
        "Phillip: Things are kind of crazy right now, but when they settle down, let's get together, all right? I would really love for you to meet my kids.",
        "Lucia: Well, thank you. I would love that so much.",
        "Phillip: Okay. It's good to see you.",
        "Lucia: Phillip? You know, when you were a little boy, I always worried about you. I didn't... I didn't want your spirit to be crushed. (Sighs) Now it's Gus I have worry about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Hey, how are you?",
        "Olivia: Hi.",
        "Cassie: What are you doing here?",
        "Olivia: Oh, just standing in till Phillip can get here.",
        "Cassie: Well, this is a mess.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, Frank's gone off to take care of it. They're not going to be in there much longer.",
        "Cassie: All right.",
        "Olivia: Okay. What are you doing here?",
        "Edmund: I'm lending a little moral support, and some political pull if I have to.",
        "Tammy: Mom. Before you say anything, I am so sorry for doing such a stupid thing and making you come back here, and everything. I had no idea it would turn into such a big deal.",
        "Cassie: Well, of course this is a big deal, Tammy. What did you think?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, let's get her out of here first, all right? Officer, what do we have to do to get these girls out of here?",
        "Cop: Chief Cooper's working on it right now.",
        "Edmund: All right, thanks.",
        "Cassie: Frank! Can I take Tammy home?",
        "Frank: Unfortunately that's not going to happen.",
        "Cassie: What? You said all I had to do was come down and pick her up.",
        "Frank: That was then, but now it's out of my hands. The D.A. wants to make an example of the girls. He's pressing charges.",
        "Cassie: Pressing charges?",
        "Olivia: For what?",
        "Marina: Well, wait, it's some silly, like, you know, misdemeanor thing like aggravated mischief or something.",
        "Frank: Okay, why don't we try grand theft auto? The girls will be arraigned in the morning, which also means that bail will have to be posted, and then that also means that...",
        "Marina: It means we have to spend the night in here?",
        "Frank: Marina...",
        "Cassie: Frank, this is crazy.",
        "Edmund: They're just children.",
        "Frank: I understand that.",
        "Olivia: Come on, it was a prank, Frank.",
        "Cassie: I mean, believe me, I think that they should be punished and they should learn their lesson. But this is insane. Prison? Where is this O'Neill guy?",
        "Edmund: Cassie...",
        "Cassie: No. He's an insensitive jerk, so how can I get in touch with him?",
        "Frank: Well, you're not going to have to wait much longer. He's on his way down here right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: So, are we going to see you this weekend at the big bash?",
        "Ben: What big bash?",
        "Blake: Marina's 18th.",
        "Ben: Oh...",
        "Blake: The big Cooper family party.",
        "Ben: ...Yeah.",
        "Blake: I know Ross and I are invited.",
        "Ben: Yeah, well, if Frank has his way, I'll be uninvited. So if you don't see me there, don't wait up.",
        "Blake: (Sighs) Frank still hasn't calmed down about you two?",
        "Ben: Oh, no. No, that's not going to happen.",
        "Blake: Yeah. Well, for the record, I think you and Marina are great together.",
        "Ben: Thanks, Blake. Well, it's good to know there's one person in this town who doesn't think I'm going to ruin her life.",
        "Blake: You won't, will you?",
        "Ben: No. I care about Marina, Blake. I really do. I mean, she really is the best thing that has ever happened to me. And having her in my life, it's... Well, it's the first time in a long time that I haven't felt like I'm alone. So the last thing I want to do is screw that up.",
        "Blake: So don't, all right? Do as I say, not as I've done, about a million times over, okay?",
        "Ben: Mm-hmm. Blake, have you ever felt like you started something because you thought you could keep it separate from the rest of you life, and then it started taking over, and you got in over your head? Forget it. No, I'm in a weird mood tonight.",
        "Blake: Oh, no, no, no. Hey, Ben, that's much more than that. You need to talk, you should talk. Trust me. Whatever it is, I've done worse.",
        "Ben: I don't think so. Thanks, though. I'm just... I'm just worried about doing the right thing for Marina.",
        "Blake: You know, when Ross and I started out, it was tough. And trust me, nobody in my family liked it one bit. But we loved each other and we stuck it out.",
        "Ben: And now you guys have the perfect life together.",
        "Blake: Well, I wouldn't go that far, but, you know, as long as you and Marina care about each other and you don't let the outside world interfere with you guys, you're going to make it. Where is she tonight?",
        "Ben: Good question. I came here to surprise her, and she's nowhere to be found.",
        "Blake: Well, who knows? Maybe she's out celebrating a pre-birthday bash with her girlfriends.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Marina?",
        "Marina: I have nothing to say to you.",
        "Frank: You know I didn't mean for this to happen, for it to go this far.",
        "Marina: Well, now you have your secret wish, Dad. I'm a real, actual criminal instead of you just treating me like one.",
        "Frank: Honey, I know you're scared.",
        "Marina: I'm not scared. I just have nothing to say to you.",
        "Frank: I'm going to go to Company, I'm going to get some bail money, and I'm going to come back here, and I'm going to get you out of here as soon as I can. I promise. Sweetie? You folks need to get counsel as soon as possible. I'll be back.",
        "Olivia: Great. All right, don't worry. Your father's going to be here soon, I hope. And I'm going to find you an attorney.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, fabulous. Thanks.",
        "Olivia: Don't be so grateful.",
        "Lizzie: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to snap at you. It just... I'm really upset.",
        "Olivia: Lizzie, the arresting officer seemed to think that stealing this car was your idea.",
        "Lizzie: What?",
        "Olivia: He thinks that you egged on Marina and Tammy and convinced them to do it.",
        "Lizzie: That's so stupid it doesn't even dignify a response.",
        "Olivia: Are you sure about that?",
        "Lizzie: They were the ones who climbed the fence. They were the ones in the car. I would never do something like that, Olivia, never. I wouldn't. Ask my dad.",
        "Olivia: Hmm, your dad. I could ask your dad, or I could just have Officer Hanley talk to him directly. How would that be? Or maybe... Maybe there's another way we can handle this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I can't believe this is happening.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, neither can I, trust me. Didn't you learn a thing from that incident with my ring?",
        "Tammy: It was Marina's car.",
        "Cassie: Locked behind a fence, Tammy! Under police jurisdiction.",
        "Tammy: It shouldn't have been there.",
        "Cassie: You broke the law. You do remember the law, don't you? Right from wrong?",
        "Tammy: Yes, I know right and wrong, Mom. Do you?",
        "Cassie: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Tammy: Nothing.",
        "Cassie: What would you father think? Do you know how disappointed he would be?",
        "Tammy: Well, how do you think he'd feel about you hooking up with Edmund down in San Cristobel? Mommy, I just want to go home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: You're a tough man to track down.",
        "Mayor: And what can I do for you, Mr. Winslow?",
        "Edmund: I need to see you immediately, Mr. Mayor.",
        "Mayor: Tonight? Regarding?",
        "Edmund: Your new District Attorney. He just made a serious error in judgment. I'll give you the details later. Where are you?",
        "Mayor: I'm in the lobby of the Beacon.",
        "Edmund: Good. Stay put. I'll be right there.",
        "Cassie: Hey, Olivia's going to watch out for Tammy. I want to go find her an attorney.",
        "Edmund: That's a good idea. Let's go back to the hotel and make a few calls and do just that.",
        "Cassie: Why don't you make a few calls? I'm going to find Jeffrey O'Neill, and I'm going to give him a piece of my mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Doorbell rings)",
        "Phillip: Hey.",
        "Gus: Hey. Zach's asleep.",
        "Phillip: Um, that's okay. Actually, I didn't come over to see him. Can I offer you a beer?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: All right. If that's the best we can do, then... I understand that. Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much.",
        "Harley: All right, I want you to know, I didn't tell Gus that Alan was the one who got him his job back. I know you think I'm being selfish, but we just got Alan out of our lives. I don't want to give him an invitation to come back in. So if you see Gus, don't tell him about Alan, obviously, and don't tell him that you told me. What are you doing?",
        "Frank: Counting.",
        "Harley: Does this have something to do with Marina? Did you spring her?",
        "Frank: It's not that easy anymore, sis. This is bail money.",
        "Harley: Bail money? Why?",
        "Frank: Because our new hard-pressed D.A. is going to make an example out of the girls. He's pressing charges. Grand theft auto.",
        "Harley: Oh, no.",
        "Frank: Sis, what have I done? What have I done? What was I thinking? This is all my fault.",
        "Harley: Okay. Frank, Frank...",
        "Frank: Harley, we're talking about my little girl, my little girl.",
        "Harley: Okay, calm down. Just calm down.",
        "Frank: Calm down? I've got to get back down there. She's going to be spending the night in jail, and she's not going to be there alone.",
        "Harley: I'll come with you.",
        "Frank: Chain up and watch this place, please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Are you trying to blackmail me? You can't keep this from my dad, Olivia. It'll be all over the papers tomorrow.",
        "Olivia: The arrest will be, yes, but I don't think your parents necessarily need to know that you were the criminal mastermind. At least they don't have to hear it from me.",
        "Lizzie: If I do something for you in return. What?",
        "Olivia: Stop being a little brat. Stop trying to cause trouble between me and your father. And I mean a sincere effort, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Why?",
        "Olivia: Because I am a much better friend than I am an enemy. So, do we have a deal?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: We'll be out of here soon.",
        "Marina: Yeah, straight into the big house.",
        "Tammy: Did you see the look on my mom's face when she lit out of here? She catches up to that new district attorney, he's in big trouble.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mayor: Well, I hope that your neighborhood school will see some of the benefits of our new education.",
        "Edmund: Excuse me, Cassie. There's something I need to take care of.",
        "Cassie: Okay, I'm going to run upstairs and change, and then we're going go find Jeffrey O'Neill.",
        "Edmund: All right.",
        "Cassie: Okay.",
        "Mayor: Mr. Ambassador, what's the problem?",
        "Edmund: Your new man, Jeffrey O'Neill. He made a serious mistake, Mr. Mayor. And I suggest you cut your losses and ship him back to New York City on a rail.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Oh, God. I'm so sorry.",
        "Jeffrey: That's just great. Great! Thanks. Ugh!",
        "Cassie: I said I was sorry. You were in the way.",
        "Jeffrey: You said you're sorry. Yeah, I heard you. You said you were sorry. Sorry's not good enough. Do you get some sort of perverse pleasure mowing people over or something?",
        "Cassie: No. Can you..."
