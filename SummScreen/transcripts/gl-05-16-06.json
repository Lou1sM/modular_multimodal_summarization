        "Colin: Hey, where do you think you're going? You almost fainted earlier.",
        "Reva: That was an hour ago. That is how long I was waiting for you while you chose to ignore me.",
        "Colin: I wasn't ignoring you, Mrs. Lewis. I had an emergency to deal with, and now I'm ready to deal with you. Nurse? Mrs. Lewis. Our first order of business is to draw some blood.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, that won't be necessary. Like I told you, I am feeling better.",
        "Colin: I'm glad to hear it. I suspected it has been a panic attack.",
        "Reva: I've never had a panic attack in my life.",
        "Colin: Well, you never had cancer before. You're about to start radiation while trying to keep the whole thing secret...",
        "Reva: Thanks for the recap, Doc.",
        "Colin: What I'm trying to say is that you have very good reason to feel anxious.",
        "Reva: Terrific. Now I'm out of here.",
        "Colin: No, no, not so fast. Mrs. Lewis, please, roll up your sleeve.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: I don't know if I can do this. Hey.",
        "Ava: Hey.",
        "Coop: Did you ever wish you could be anyone else by yourself?",
        "Ava: I would never want you to be anyone but you.",
        "Coop: That's not exactly what I was...",
        "Ava: Look, whatever you decide tonight, good luck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Okay, so how many people do you want to bring? Two? No, that's great. Great. I am so glad that you're going to make it. Okay. I'll see you then. Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Hey, hey, wait up. How about we bag meeting with your friend, and get back to my bike and go some place more private, like Laurel Falls.",
        "Tammy: And then what?",
        "Jonathan: And then... I'm just saying.",
        "Tammy: I'm saying I think I should answer my phone right now. ( Cell phone ring )",
        "Tammy: Hello?",
        "Lizzie: Hey, Tammy, it's Lizzie. Listen, I am having a party at my family's house tomorrow, and it's kind of important to me, and I was really hoping you guys could come?",
        "Tammy: What do you mean it's a big deal? Is it a special occasion or something? Are you serious? Wow, I thought, um... well, that's great. We'll be there. Yeah, okay. All right, bye.",
        "Jonathan: What's up?",
        "Tammy: Lizzie and Coop are getting engaged.",
        "Jonathan: Really?",
        "Tammy: He is taking her out tonight to propose.",
        "Jonathan: How does she know that?",
        "Tammy: Some girls just know, I guess. Well, they're having a party tomorrow to celebrate.",
        "Jonathan: Wow, that's good, though. I mean, this way that kid is going to be raised by a mom and a dad.",
        "Tammy: I guess it's good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: This is it, little one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: We think that Ross' PI found out that Phillip was alive, and somebody wants to keep him quiet.",
        "Beth: Oh, my God.",
        "Alan: Beth, Beth, you can't take these two seriously.",
        "Beth: Phillip, Phillip...",
        "Alan: Wait. Wait.",
        "Gus: Sorry. I'm sorry. What the hell is going on?",
        "Mallet: I found her.",
        "Harley: Dinah, where have you been?",
        "Alan: Isn't this great, the entire town of Springfield in my house.",
        "Blake: I don't care who is here. I want some answers about my husband's death. Jeffrey and I found some interesting information...",
        "Gus: Wait, time out. We have something to tell everybody, but it may come as a shock, except to my father, of course. But that is a whole other story. Baby, tell them.",
        "Harley: Rick, the reason that Gus just jumped you right now is because we thought you were somebody else. We thought you were Phillip. Phillip is alive.",
        "Jeffrey: Phillip?",
        "Harley: We have proof. The picture that Beth was holding was taken here in the hotel room here on the island, and it is Ross' hotel room.",
        "Beth: Oh, my God.",
        "Jeffrey: We just learned that Ross' plane was headed here, too.",
        "Harley: We think that Ross was coming down here to talk to him, try to convince him to come home.",
        "Gus: When Phillip found out he was coming down here, he made sure the plane never made it.",
        "Dinah: Phillip loved my father.",
        "Harley: Maybe he is still as sick as he was when he left.",
        "Gus: Sick and dangerous.",
        "Alan: You can stop looking at me that way.",
        "Gus: I can't help myself. You're amazing to me. This whole time you knew that Phillip was alive.",
        "Alan: Yes, and I tried to tell everyone, but no one would believe me. I can tell you this: I don't know anything about this latest business. I haven't seen or heard from Phillip since he escaped from where I had the doctors taking care of him, and that was over a year ago.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, the Springfield Police just arrested the mechanic who sabotaged the plane and shot Detective Mallet. That's how we found out the plane was headed this way.",
        "Blake: He also told us he never met the person he worked for. He just assumed it was a man. The money he got was deposited directly into a special account.",
        "Jeffrey: We traced the checks to something called the Blue Skies Corporation which was set up in Springfield about a month ago. We checked the names and the social security numbers, and they were all bogus. Phillip had someone working for him. And I am expecting a call from my assistant with a name, and that person will be charged as an accessory to murder.",
        "Alan: I'm telling you it wasn't me.",
        "Harley: Then who? Who else, Alan?",
        "Beth: I don't feel well.",
        "Alan: Are you all right? Is it the baby?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "( Knock on door )",
        "Lizzie: Hey, there you are. I'm so glad that you're here. I know that you hate this place.",
        "Coop: No, it's great. The house is beautiful, it's just that I...",
        "Lizzie: I understand. I understand. My grandfather has made you the enemy. How could you possibly feel comfortable here? But granddad is not going to run our lives.",
        "Coop: Our lives?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. You, me, we make a good team, and we're going to be great parents together.",
        "Coop: Yeah. We will be good parents. I promise you that I will do all that I can for this baby.",
        "Lizzie: We're very lucky to have you.",
        "Coop: We?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, me and the little whoever. Come on, let's go. I'm starving, starving!",
        "Coop: Okay. Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I guess it is good that Lizzie and Coop are getting married for the baby's sake, anyway. But Coop doesn't love Lizzie.",
        "Jonathan: Worse things can happen to a dude than marrying into a family of zillionaires, and he'll be set for life. Plus, Lizzie will be thrilled and she'll have everything she wants and she'll leave us alone. So, it's a win/win.",
        "Ava: Hey, guys.",
        "Tammy: How are you?",
        "Ava: Good. I'm really busy. I had to go to Co2 and get some more sugar.",
        "Tammy: Are you okay?",
        "Ava: Yeah, why?",
        "Tammy: Lizzie called me about the engagement.",
        "Ava: Lizzie knows?",
        "Tammy: Yeah.",
        "Ava: Then I guess it's really going to happen.",
        "Tammy: I'm sorry.",
        "Ava: Don't be. I'm fine.",
        "Jonathan: Please, new subject. Lizzie, Coop, Ava, boring. How about that ride to the Falls?",
        "Tammy: I told Lizzie I would meet her to congratulate her.",
        "Jonathan: I'll meet up with you later? I think I'll skip that event.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, I'll call you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colin: I asked the lab to expedite your results. I'll be back.",
        "Reva: Hey, wait. I told you that the panic is gone, bye-bye, and you ran a whole slew of tests...",
        "Colin: A few weeks ago, and then you refused treatment, and now you have no symptoms. I can't just dismiss you without following up.",
        "Reva: Okay. Run whatever tests you want to run, but tell me tomorrow when I come in for my first radiation treatment.",
        "Colin: Now, Reva.",
        "Reva: Why can't it wait a day? If I'm not home by the time Josh gets there, I'll have to make up a whole other excuse and I would really not have to do that.",
        "Colin: So tell your husband the truth.",
        "Reva: Not yet. Why can't it wait? What's the problem?",
        "Colin: The problem? The problem is the emergency I had to deal with earlier, one of my patients died, and I don't want the next one to be you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Oh.",
        "Coop: I am sorry they gave away our table.",
        "Lizzie: I am going to talk to my granddad, what's the point of belonging to a country club if they give your table away?",
        "Coop: I will make it up to you.",
        "Lizzie: I'm not worried. I'm just happy to be spending a wonderful night with you.",
        "Coop: Yeah. Listen, Lizzie, about why I wanted to see you tonight...",
        "Lizzie: Look at the flowers. Look over there, they are so beautiful.",
        "Coop: Yeah, yeah, I guess so.",
        "Lizzie: They're so different, I've got to find out who did them.",
        "Coop: Yeah. Back to why I wanted to see you tonight. There is something we need to talk about.",
        "Lizzie: Yes.",
        "Coop: It's kind of important.",
        "Lizzie: Okay.",
        "Coop: Look, I've been thinking about us and the baby. And the baby coming, and it is just so important that we do this right. You know, that we do everything for him or her to make their life the best it could possibly be. You know?",
        "Lizzie: I know. I totally agree. We're on exactly the same page.",
        "Coop: That's great. That's excellent. And I hope that we stay on that same page, you know. It's just that things are not always going to be easy. And problems will come up...",
        "Lizzie: We will fix them. We can do anything together.",
        "Coop: Yeah. Yeah. And then, of course, there is your family. We both know how unpredictable your grandfather is.",
        "Lizzie: Stop worrying about him. You are so freaking cute. It's taking you forever to say this. Are you nervous?",
        "Coop: Yeah, uh-huh. A little, I guess.",
        "Lizzie: Just spit it out, Henry.",
        "Coop: Right. Lizzie, it's not that easy.",
        "Lizzie: It is. Look, I'm going to help you. Take your hand, put it into your pocket, and pull out the... what's this? Where's the ring?",
        "Coop: The ring?",
        "Lizzie: Okay, seriously, don't tease me. I saw the ring, and I know... never mind. You're really going to like the answer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: It's really sweet of you to be concerned about me, but, you know, you don't need to be. It's really all up to Coop, and it's about whether or not he is going to marry Lizzie.",
        "Tammy: Well, I mean, he already decided, right?",
        "Ava: Well, when he left, he hadn't actually proposed before he left, so... well, where are you going?",
        "Tammy: To save Lizzie from herself. It's a lousy job, but who else is going to do it?",
        "Ava: Has it happened yet?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colin: You trying to take off again?",
        "Reva: No, I was looking for you, because you left me in here all by myself again forever. Are those the results of my tests?",
        "Colin: Yeah.",
        "Reva: Well?",
        "Colin: Your left nodes are still \"O\" positive, which means they're cancer- free.",
        "Reva: That's good, right, that's good?",
        "Colin: Yeah, that's good. But I'm afraid that's the only good news I have for you. It's what I suspected, given your symptoms-- dizziness, weakness. Your blood work shows an elevated white cell count. And with your state of stage- two breast cancer, that means that the cancer could be spreading through your bloodstream. I cancelled your radiation appointment for tomorrow. I want to get you straight to the chemotherapy. I can't remember...",
        "Reva: The cancer has spread?",
        "Colin: Could be spreading, and we need to blast it out of your body.",
        "Reva: Chemo, like make you sick, like lose your hair-type chemo?",
        "Colin: I know it's a shock. I'll give you a few minutes to digest it. I'll be back.",
        "Reva: Wait, he tells me that, and then he just walks out.",
        "Jonathan: Reva?",
        "Reva: Hi, Jonathan. Oh, dear lord.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: I'm dizzy and I'm having cramps.",
        "Alan: We've got to get her to the hospital now.",
        "Beth: No, I just want to go upstairs and lie down.",
        "Rick: That's a very good idea. Let me help you.",
        "Beth: Alan.",
        "Rick: I got it, Alan.",
        "Harley: Dinah, you never answered my question. Where have you been? Did you ever find Alan-Michael? What happened with him?",
        "Mallet: Dinah found him, but he didn't have any answers for us.",
        "Rick: You need to get upstairs. Are you okay? Just lay in the bed.",
        "Beth: Phillip is alive.",
        "Rick: I know it comes as quite a shock. Just lay back and take it easy.",
        "Beth: And Alan... Alan knew all along, and he didn't tell me. How could he to that?",
        "Rick: Maybe he was just trying to protect his son.",
        "Beth: From us? We love Phillip, we've done crazy things trying to protect him. We could have been out looking for him.",
        "Rick: Stop it. You're manic, and your heart is racing out of control. You've got to stop it.",
        "Harley: How is she doing?",
        "Mallet: She's doing fine. How are you doing? It's got to be kind of scary?",
        "Harley: I'm not sure how I'm doing. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Jeffrey: It's my office. Hello?",
        "Beth: Something isn't right here. I keep thinking about the night Phillip was shot.",
        "Rick: Don't think about it. Don't do this to yourself.",
        "Beth: There was so much blood on the floor, and I kept thinking how could anybody survive that losing all of that? Blood?",
        "Rick: You haven't told me about baby names. Have you come up with any new baby names?",
        "Beth: At the hospital, the doctor came out and said that Phillip had died...",
        "Rick: Stop it. Please stop it.",
        "Beth: I remember that like it was yesterday, just like I remembered Harley's wedding after the autopsy, and you... you exhumed the body. You said that he was in that coffin, you said...",
        "Rick: Beth, give me a second and I can explain this to you. Let me explain, please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Could you repeat that? The person who was fronting Phillip's dummy corporation was...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: You knew all along! You knew! You knew!",
        "Rick: Beth, stop it.",
        "Beth: ( Sobbing ) you knew!",

        "Beth Elhers, \"Inside The Light.\" I don't know anything but the crew, my whole life. Like Harry Met Sally, it's such a great romantic comedy, and I guess that's what I like to play. That's what I always like to play, the comedy things. See Harley, Wednesday, May 17, \"Inside The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Hey, don't do that. Don't. What happened?",
        "Jonathan: I fell off my bike. No biggie.",
        "Reva: Well, are you sure that there are no broken bones or internal...",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, Reva, I'm fine. Stop being such a mother.",
        "Reva: Look at this. Oh, Dr. McCabe, this is my son, Jonathan. He's been in an motorcycle accident and he needs assistance.",
        "Colin: I'll get an attending.",
        "Reva: You're here right now.",
        "Colin: Mrs. Lewis, I'm not an E.R. physician. I'm an oncol...",
        "Reva: This is my son, help him.",
        "Colin: This way.",
        "Jonathan: Wow, one word from Reva, and they're jumping.",
        "Reva: Momma's got pull, baby.",
        "Jonathan: What are you doing here, anyway?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Look, Lizzie, I didn't mean to give you the wrong idea.",
        "Lizzie: The wrong idea?",
        "Coop: How do you see the ring anyway?",
        "Lizzie: Who cares. Just ask me to marry you.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, I'm not ready to do that.",
        "Lizzie: I don't understand. You have a ring. I saw the ring. I wasn't snooping. I found it. I was looking in your pocket for a tissue. Why else would you have a ring if you weren't... oh, my God. Ava? Are you going to propose to Ava?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Get a grip, Ava. Coop is gone for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Thanks, I'll get back to you.",
        "Gus: Who is it. Who is doing Phillip's dirty work?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: How could you do this to me!",
        "Rick: Beth, I didn't know he was alive all this time. I swear to you. And whatever happened that day at the hospital, the day he supposedly died, I wasn't a part of that. I thought he died, just like you did. I grieved, just like you did. And quite honestly, I was relieved he wasn't around, that he couldn't hurt my son anymore. And then one day he came to the house. I walked out the back door and there he was with this stupid grin on his face. Beth, do you have any idea how surreal it was to be standing there and looking in the face of my best friend that I thought was dead? He was manic, he was out of control and he was angry. And he acknowledged he was emotionally unstable and he did terrible things and he needed to stay away. So he begged me to lie, Beth. He begged me to lie and say-- listen to me-- he begged me to lie and say he was the one in that casket, and in his words, he said that he would stay away from my son. That's what he said. What other choice did I have? Yes, it was a lie, but there is no way in hell I was ever going to let him touch my son again. Beth, you would have done the same thing. If it was your child, you would have done the same thing. If it was your son...",
        "Beth: That was the last time that you saw him, that you talked to him? Rick, you would do anything...",
        "Rick: I want you to calm down right now. I want you to calm down. Don't do this, Beth. Where are you going?",
        "Dinah: You killed my father. How dare you! How dare you!",
        "Rick: Blake.",
        "Blake: Rick, tell me you had nothing to do with this. Oh, my God.",
        "Rick: It was a mistake, Blake. It was a tragic mistake. The plane was never supposed to take off. I just told Beth that I didn't hear from Phillip until Gus and Harley's wedding, the day the body was exhumed. I thought he was dead just like everybody else did. I did this... I did this because he was a dangerous man. I did this because I was convinced if he ever came home, I would never see my son again.",
        "Gus: But you heard from him again?",
        "Rick: He called last month in a panic saying that Ross had found him and he didn't feel safe. He needed some time to get off the island. So he made contact with a mechanic who was servicing Ross' plane. He had this guy arrange a problem that would prohibit the plane from ever leaving the ground in Washington, D.C. You see, Ross was... he was supposed to switch planes.",
        "Blake: No.",
        "Rick: He needed somebody to pay this guy. So I did it.",
        "Blake: Why did you do that, Rick?",
        "Rick: Because Jude is my son. And I wasn't going to allow anybody ever to kidnap him ever again. I'm so sorry. I loved Ross and respected him more than any man I ever met in my life, more than my own father. I will never forgive myself. I'm so sorry. Blake, I'm so sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: No, no, no, Lizzie. I was thinking that when I bought the ring that perhaps maybe you and I should get married for the baby's sake.",
        "Lizzie: Right.",
        "Coop: But someday, who knows, but not now. There is just way too much that has happened. Look at me, would you please. If we were to rush this, Lizzie, it just wouldn't be right. Okay. I care about you, and now we have this brand-new connection. We'll always have this connection because of the baby. But...",
        "Lizzie: But you don't love me?",
        "Coop: Not like that. Not the way you should love someone to say that you're going to spend the rest of your life with her.",
        "Lizzie: And Ava?",
        "Coop: Look...",
        "Lizzie: Do you love her like that?",
        "Coop: Ava and I are not together, and you know that.",
        "Lizzie: That's not what I asked you.",
        "Coop: Look, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Lizzie, look... would you please just look at me. Listen. Geez. I care about you, and I care about the baby. That is not going to change. Lizzie, I am here for you.",
        "Lizzie: Well, that is what's important.",
        "Coop: Oh, my gosh, come on. Would you stop pretending and playing games here. It's me. If your upset, if your disappointed, if you're mad, fine, I understand that. Be honest with me. That's all I'm asking. Just be honest with me.",
        "Lizzie: Is that what you want, you want me to be honest with you?",
        "Coop: Yes, that's what I want.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, I'll be honest with you. Yes, I am disappointed. I thought that you were ready to make a family. But if your heart is not in it, then okay. Okay, I understand, I hurt you. And you've got your pride and you're on the rebound, and Ava is always around.",
        "Coop: This is not about Ava.",
        "Lizzie: Ava doesn't matter. That's not the point. If you don't want to marry me, then I don't want to marry you. Because the guy that I am going to marry is going to be madly and deeply in love with me, and I am going to find that guy. And he is going to be a great father to my child.",
        "Coop: You mean stepfather.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, technically, but think about it, Coop, if me and him are together, he is automatically going to be with our child a lot. And the child will probably consider him his father, but you know what, those are all details we're going to work out. Just you, me and granddad's lawyer.",
        "Coop: Whoa, Lizzie, it really doesn't have to come to that.",
        "Lizzie: You don't have to stay. Go back to your whatever. Just go.",
        "Coop: I'm not going to leave you here alone.",
        "Lizzie: I'll call a car. Just go.",
        "Coop: You really want that?",
        "Lizzie: Yes, please. I feel like you're feeling sorry for me, and it's making me feel self-conscious. Just go.",
        "Coop: Okay. I'll see you later.",
        "Lizzie: Call you tomorrow.",
        "Tammy: Hey, Lizzie, congratulations!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: So you didn't answer my question: What are you doing here?",
        "Colin: Answer your son and stop hovering.",
        "Reva: Dr. McCabe offered to give me some information -- data and research and that sort of thing for the, um, PR packages for the veterans' hospital project. But enough about that. Let's talk about him. How is he?",
        "Colin: Well, he doesn't seem to have any broken bones, although an ER doctor should order some x-rays just to be sure.",
        "Jonathan: See, told you.",
        "Reva: Watch it, kid.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, I've been taking care of myself long before you came into the picture.",
        "Reva: Oh, yes, and you did such a great job of it, too. You were such a joy when we met.",
        "Jonathan: We haven't known each other very long. She gave me up when I was born to a bunch of circus clowns.",
        "Colin: Right.",
        "Jonathan: It's true, it's true. ( Laughs ) That guys a barrel of laughs.",
        "Reva: Oh, he's cute. Are you sure you didn't bump your head or anything when you fell?",
        "Jonathan: Bump my head, I don't know.",
        "Reva: What do you mean?",
        "Jonathan: I was wearing a helmet. Lighten up. I liked you better when you were teaching me how to hot-wire cars.",
        "Reva: Motorcycles are dangerous, you need to be more careful.",
        "Jonathan: I was being careful. It was the other guy who wasn't being careful. Some yuppie in a convertible. Went through a stop sign at 60 miles per hour and didn't even notice it. You want me to be like that, Reva, some jerk, stuck-up yuppie in a sports car and mows down pedestrians and croaks of a heart attack.",
        "Reva: I don't want you to croak at all.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, right. We've all got to go sometime. Follow your bliss. That's what you always told me, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: I'll take you back to Springfield so you can make a formal statement.",
        "Harley: Wait, before you go, please tell us everything you know about Phillip.",
        "Rick: I have no idea where he is.",
        "Gus: He is still protecting him.",
        "Beth: Rick, help me.",
        "Rick: What's wrong.",
        "Beth: Cramps, cramps. Oh! Don't leave me!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: What happened? Are you all right?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, yeah, yeah, fine, I'm great. Tears of joy.",
        "Tammy: Where is Coop?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, he had to run back to Company for some minor emergency. We're going to hook up later.",
        "Tammy: So you're engaged?",
        "Lizzie: Of course I am.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, I was just wondering because I don't see a ring?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, yeah, well, um, you know, Coop doesn't have very much money right now, so he is going to have to save up to buy me one. But he asked me, and, um, I said yes. So, yeah, we're engaged. ( Cell phone rings ) Hello? Yes, yes, you were absolutely right. You should order more for the raw bar. Oh, yeah. Yep, lots of people. Okay, bye.",
        "Tammy: So the party is happening tomorrow?",
        "Lizzie: Of course it is. Everything is arranged. Everybody has their invites.",
        "Tammy: I just thought...",
        "Lizzie: We're engaged, Tammy. The ring is really just a formality. It's what's in our hearts. That's what really matters.",
        "Tammy: Okay.",
        "Lizzie: Why are you saying it like that. You're saying it like you don't believe me.",
        "Tammy: No, it's not that I'm doubting you, Lizzie. It's just I find you here sitting all alone without a ring on your finger and you don't look happy, so I just thought maybe one or both of you weren't so sure about this engagement thing, which under the circumstances would be perfectly understandable.",
        "Lizzie: What am I going to do, just call off the party? Everybody has the invitations and everything.",
        "Tammy: Not call off. Just postpone until you're sure.",
        "Lizzie: I am sure. We're sure. Coop and I are engaged, and we're going to have a party tomorrow, and that is that. So are you going to come or not?",
        "Tammy: Of course I'll come.",
        "Lizzie: Great. Make sure to bring Jonathan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colin: All right, Jonathan, these are instructions on how to change your dressings there.",
        "Jonathan: Thanks.",
        "Colin: And, Reva, here is that information that you wanted.",
        "Reva: Thanks. Thank you.",
        "Colin: Any questions?",
        "Jonathan: No.",
        "Reva: No.",
        "Colin: Okay, well, you can go home now, both of you.",
        "Reva: Thank you.",
        "Colin: All right.",
        "Reva: Okay. ( Laughs ) Let's go.",

        "Rick: We need to get her to the hospital. Somebody please call an ambulance. I'll do it.",
        "Alan: \"We.\" Rick, after what I just learned, I don't want you near my wife or my unborn child.",
        "Rick: Alan, do you have any medical training? I didn't think so. She is staying in my hands until we get another medical doctor. If you don't like that, tough.",
        "Jeffrey: Ambulance is on it's way.",
        "Rick: An ambulance is on its way.",
