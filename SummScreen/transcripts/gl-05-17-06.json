        "On the island, Mallet admits to Harley that he knew Phillip was alive and that Rick was covering for Phillip. Gus looks annoyed that Harley and Mallet are talking. Gus receives a phone call from a housekeeper across the island who heard a plane take off in haste; someone was leaving the island in a hurry. A police officer tries to arrest Dinah and Mallet smoothes over everything and gets the charges against Dinah dropped. Later, Gus pours a whiskey for Dinah to settle her nerves. Mallet and Dinah are talking in their bedroom and Gus, out of their sight, walks in. Dinah tells Mallet that she can see when someone is grieving how they reach out to others for comfort. \"I get it how two people like you and Harley could sleep together when Harley thought Gus was gone\", she tells Mallet. Gus starts to take a drink of the whiskey and horrified by what he hears, crushes the glass in his hands. Gus tells Harley he needs to ask her something but Mallet returns to help Harley dress the wound. Gus has hate in his eyes.",
        "A reverend arrives announcing that he is there to marry the Spauldings. Since Beth and Alan have left, Harley tells him that she and Gus will renew their vows. Gus is less than eager. They stand before the reverend and Harley tells Gus that he is her hero and she loves him. Meanwhile, Mallet finally admits to Dinah that he knew Phillip was alive. She finds a letter from Ross addressed to Mallet. In the letter Ross tells Dinah that he is proud of her and is glad she has Mallet. After the renewal vows, Gus takes Harley upstairs and makes angry love to her. Mallet and Dinah make sweet tender love. Gus, after Harley is asleep, goes downstairs and starts to drink from a bottle of alcohol. He finds Harley's purse and searches for a bottle. Once he finds this, he takes a pill from it, pauses to look upstairs, and shoves the pill in his mouth. He washes it down with long gulps of alcohol, disappointment and disbelief written on his face."

        "Gus: Nice job, Phil. I'll find you, you can put your money on it. You're not going to hurt my family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: How you doing? The guy can't hide from us forever, okay.",
        "Dinah: I don't care if they find Phillip; I really don't care. It still doesn't bring my father back.",
        "Mallet: Well, at this point in time, maybe it's a matter of justice.",
        "Dinah: Justice? Justice would be if my father decided never to get on that plane. And nobody can help us out with that.",
        "Harley: Go, go, go, go after her.",
        "Mallet: I don't want to; I can't.",
        "Harley: She's a wreck. Mallet, she needs you.",
        "Mallet: I can't.",
        "Harley: Why not?",
        "Mallet: I just... because I knew.",
        "Harley: Knew what?",
        "Mallet: I knew that, um-- I knew that Phillip was alive. ( Cell phone ringing )",
        "Mallet: When was that, this? Are you positive?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Oh, daddy, are you at peace? I think if I knew, it'd be a little easier. Oh, man, I promised you I would figure out what happened to you, and I did. I figured it out. And I know who did it. And I know why you died, but why is not making it any easier. It's not making it any easier losing you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Yeah, well, where would that be exactly? Uh-huh.",
        "Harley: What did you just say?",
        "Mallet: I said that, um... I knew Phillip was alive.",
        "Harley: How long have you known this?",
        "Mallet: Since your wedding.",
        "Harley: Oh, my god!",
        "Mallet: I saw him in a parking garage in Springfield that morning.",
        "Harley: Did you talk to him?",
        "Mallet: No, I didn't talk to him. I caught a quick glimpse of him, but it was long enough to be pretty sure about who it was. And then I ran to the ceremony and that's when I learned Rick had performed an autopsy on him.",
        "Harley: So you knew what Rick did?",
        "Mallet: What I knew was what Rick told me. Rick swore to me he was not coming back and he was not going to hurt you.",
        "Harley: This makes no sense. You knew that Phillip was alive and you said nothing to me, of all people.",
        "Mallet: I was going to. I was going to run right into your wedding ceremony.",
        "Harley: But you didn't?",
        "Mallet: I didn't. I stood inside Company, and I watched you on the monitor, and I watched you walk down the aisle, and I saw Gus take your hand. You looked so damn happy.",
        "Harley: Oh, Mallet.",
        "Mallet: I weighed my options.",
        "Harley: I guess I understand that.",
        "Mallet: Ow.",
        "Harley: But Dinah is different. You have to be honest with her. I'm serious.",
        "Mallet: What she needs is comfort, and how can I give her that when my silence may have cost her her father's life?",
        "Harley: I don't know. Sometimes I just...",
        "Gus: Hi. Well, I got some news. Everything all right?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, we're just talking about Dinah and how tough this whole thing is on her.",
        "Gus: Yet, you're still out here. It's funny how that works.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I was just getting ready to go inside. What have you got? What did you find out?",
        "Gus: There seems to be an estate across the other side of island, and I put a couple of phone calls out and the housekeeper just called me back. They have their own landing strip, right. She hears a plane take off earlier this morning from the house. The owners haven't been there for at least two weeks. Somebody needed to get out of town in a hurry.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, let's go check it out.",
        "Harley: No, no, no, no. You stay with Dinah. Gus and I will check it out.",
        "Island cop: You won't find Mr. Mallet and Ms. Marler here when you get back.",
        "Mallet: Is there a problem, officer?",
        "Island cop: You told our chief that you and Ms. Marler would be gone a long time, that was a lie.",
        "Harley: According to who?",
        "Island cop: A local photographer identified Mr. Mallet as having been with him during the time Mr. Mallet claimed to be with his lady friend, which casts doubt on both your stories.",
        "Mallet: Well, what are you going to do, arrest us?",
        "Island Cop: You and Ms. Marler need to come with me for further questioning.",
        "Harley: Can't we talk about this? I'm sure we can straighten this out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Mallet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: You're right, Officer and thank you. I forgot to tell the chief of police that I asked a photographer about Dinah. We were walking together down a side street, I lost track of her and I was trying to find her again. Now as far as Dinah's story goes, Alan-Michael Spaulding's charges against her are totally bogus.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: What are you doing?",
        "Gus: There is a cop out there. He's not here to arrest me. He's here to arrest you.",
        "Dinah: Like hell he is.",
        "Gus: You go out there, you're going to make things worse, okay?",
        "Dinah: You know what, how can they get any worse?",
        "Gus: Why are you talking like this? You have Mallet in your life; try to remember that, okay?",
        "Dinah: Until he gets his butt thrown into jail.",
        "Gus: He's not going anywhere.",
        "Dinah: You know what, I really wish I could say that about my father. I really do.",
        "Gus: Dinah, all I can tell you is that things get better. I know this because I was exactly where you are right now.",
        "Dinah: I'm sorry, I forgot.",
        "Gus: Hey, look, my father was murdered and I saw it happened-- I was a kid-- I mean, you know I was eating ice cream.",
        "Dinah: How did you do it?",
        "Gus: What?",
        "Dinah: Get past the rage and the hurt?",
        "Gus: Harley made it easier for me not to let the anger run my life.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, but those feelings, those feelings, they don't do anything. They don't bring your daddy back.",
        "Gus: No, no, they don't. And my father's not coming back. And your father's not coming back. So the only thing you can do is just hang on for dear life, you know, to the people that are around you, the people that love you the most.",
        "Dinah: It's really wrong, and it's unfair. It's really messed up, actually, because I know that Phillip didn't want my dad to land on this island, and for that, he's dead. I don't understand that. I can't stop thinking about it. I question so much, and I come up with not one answer. I end up having more questions, you know. And I'd like to know, you know. I mean, in that moment, when it was going down, what was he feeling? Did he have terror?",
        "Gus: Dinah, you do this to yourself, and you're going to drive yourself crazy.",
        "Dinah: Like I give any-- like I care? Half the town thinks I'm crazy, so why don't I go for it?",
        "Gus: Why? Because you would be letting your father down. Your father loved you. He loved the woman that you were becoming. He loved how you turned your life around. And my advice to you is you keep being that woman, you keep being that daughter that your father wanted you to be.",
        "Dinah: I don't think anybody really understands what that entails, and how much I fight that every day.",
        "Gus: You don't feel like you have Mallet that you can lean on?",
        "Dinah: I have a difficult time trusting. And I am not as vulnerable as I probably should be. And it makes me do the stupidest things.",
        "Gus: Like hunting down Alan-Michael? Right?",
        "Dinah: I went completely out of my head on that one.",
        "Gus: But I see that Mallet loves you. I mean, you know I... you don't feel like you can trust that? Is it because of Harley?",
        "Dinah: No. It's not that. It's me. It's me. And I have to learn how to rein myself in.",
        "Gus: You want to tell me what you're really scared of?",
        "Mallet: Hey.",
        "Gus: Everything all right?",
        "Mallet: Yeah. Yeah, she's quite the liar this one.",
        "Harley: ( Laughs ) No match for you.",
        "Gus: Teamwork: Go, go.",
        "Mallet: But anyway, you're in the clear now, okay? You're case is being dropped.",
        "Gus: Who wants a drink?",
        "Mallet: No, I'm good, man. Thanks. You?",
        "Harley: We're going to get a couple of mango coolers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: That's not a mango cooler.",
        "Gus: Yeah. It's just a shot of whiskey. It's not for me, it's for Dinah. I thought it would mango cool her down.",
        "Harley: What were you guys talking about in there?",
        "Gus: We were talking about our demons and how we both have them, and how we both fight them on a daily basis.",
        "Harley: But you're winning, right?",
        "Gus: So far, right?",
        "Harley: Good.",
        "Gus: Um, if you are worried about Phillip being out there, going after our kids, it ain't going to happen. So, don't.",
        "Harley: I'm not worried about Phillip. Because we are together, and you're getting better every day. And I hope by now you know that's the most important thing in my life, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: You know, I'm really starting to understand what this is all about. This whole nightmare has taught me a lot about my father's death. I don't know, I mean I learned more about grief than I can even explain, and how loss just makes you feel like you've lost yourself as a person.",
        "Mallet: Do you feel lost?",
        "Dinah: No. What I'm saying is that I think that it's made me think about Harley and how-- sweetie, I get it. I get it how two people like you and Harley could sleep together, you know, when Harley thought Gus was gone. I... I get it. ( Glass breaks )",
        "Harley: Hey, did you-- whoa, what happened? Honey.",
        "Gus: It was an accident.",
        "Mallet: Hey, what's up?",
        "Dinah: Gus?",
        "Mallet: Whoa.",
        "Gus: I'll clean myself up.",
        "Harley: Do you have an handkerchief?",
        "Dinah: Gus, let me see.",
        "Mallet: What happened?",
        "Harley: I'm not sure.",
        "Dinah: I have some bandages in here.",
        "Harley: Oh, no, that's good. Thank you. How are you guys doing?",
        "Dinah: I think we're okay.",
        "Harley: Yeah? Let me take it off. I'm going to go.",
        "Gus: We're good.",
        "Harley: Hey, let me help you. Oh, gosh, you are really bleeding.",
        "Gus: I'm okay.",
        "Harley: Are you crazy? Let me look at that thing. Babe, we've got to get that glass out of there. Really. How did you do this, anyway? Oh, gosh. Are you okay?",
        "Gus: We have to be open with each other, right?",
        "Harley: Yeah, uh-huh.",
        "Gus: And we learned that lesson the hard way, didn't we?",
        "Harley: Uh-huh.",
        "Gus: That not being open with each other, telling each other everything, well, that's the way we get screwed, right?",
        "Harley: Are you going into shock on me, babe?",
        "Gus: Yeah, I think I am going into shock. Can I ask you something.",
        "Mallet: How's the patient?",
        "Gus: Well, I'm not going to fall off the end of the planet and die.",
        "Mallet: Good. Dinah's sweeping up the glass. I just wanted to assist Dr. Cooper.",
        "Gus: We don't need your help.",
        "Harley: Actually, I could use it. Could you get some peroxide and bandages out of there? And find me a big bowl.",
        "Mallet: Peroxide.",
        "Harley: Honey, relax your hand, okay? Thanks.",
        "Mallet: Gauge, tape, bandage.",
        "Harley: Please wash your hand. Let me do this. If you have any problems, I'll just take it up with management later.",
        "Mallet: What about this, is this big enough?",
        "Harley: Yeah, that is perfect, thank you. Could you put your hand over the bowl? Thanks. Ooh. Well, that's not so bad.",
        "Mallet: It looks kind of serious?",
        "Harley: No, it's not serious at all. There.",
        "Mallet: Man, take it easy on the glass next time.",
        "Harley: I agree.",
        "Gus: I can do this.",
        "Harley: No, no. Here, let me just wrap the bandage around it at least.",
        "Gus: It's fine, I've got it.",
        "Harley: Okay.",
        "Mallet: No problem.",
        "Harley: Some wrappings.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I hear you.",
        "Harley: Did you have that conversation with Dinah?",
        "Mallet: No.",
        "Harley: Mallet, I think you should tell her. I think it's best for both of you.",
        "Mallet: Is there anything else you need me to do?",
        "Gus: Are you two done?",
        "Harley: Yeah.",
        "Mallet: Yeah.",
        "Gus: Mind if I talk to my wife?",
        "Mallet: That's fine.",
        "Harley: Is there a problem?",
        "Gus: That's an interesting question.",
        "Harley: Is your leg bothering you again?",
        "Gus: No, my leg isn't bothering me.",
        "Harley: Well, do you want uh...?",
        "Gus: Do I want what? Finish your sentence. Do I want what?",
        "Harley: You know.",
        "Gus: Oh, do I want drugs? Is that... no, I don't.",
        "Harley: Well, obviously something is wrong.",
        "Gus: Remember how you always said that trust is everything? And truth is everything? Well, I'd like to believe that. But I don't think that I can.",
        "Harley: I think I know what's happening here. There's been so much awful stuff, you know. Every time that we believe that things are getting better, there's another crisis, there's another hurdle we have to get past, and it gets hard to trust that things really will be okay this time.",
        "Gus: Will they?",
        "Dinah: Well, I cleaned up all of the glass. I'm sorry, am I interrupting?",
        "Harley: No, of course not. Thank you for helping.",
        "Gus: Yeah, you're a big help. ( Knock on the door )",
        "Harley: Yes.",
        "Minister: Wonderful, you are here. Which one of you lovely ladies is the bride?",
        "Harley: Excuse me?",
        "Minister: I'm reverend weeks. I'm here to conduct the ceremony.",
        "Harley: Excuse me?",
        "Minister: The renewal of vows celebration. Are you Mrs. Spaulding?",
        "Dinah: No. She sort of is.",
        "Harley: Sort of. I think you have the wrong joyous household.",
        "Mallet: I think Alan and Beth were planning on renewing their vows. I bet that's why they came down here in the first place.",
        "Gus: Love's all over the place, isn't it? Actually, you know, the couple you're looking for flew home. An emergency came up. Mr. And Mrs. Spaulding left the island.",
        "Minister: That's a pity, because Mr. Snead is waiting outside with a van full of food and flowers.",
        "Mallet: Wow. Wow, that's a shame.",
        "Minister: Well, I suppose I should be going now.",
        "Harley: Wait. We'll do it.",
        "Gus: We'll do what?",
        "Harley: Renew our vows.",
        "Gus: You crazy.",
        "Harley: Come on. We can use Mallet and Dinah as our witnesses, right? It's a chance to reaffirm everything that we think is-- I don't know-- true and good in this world, and that's you and me.",
        "Gus: Me and you?",
        "Harley: Me and you. Whatever. Come on, you said you were afraid of what might happen next. Screw what might happen next. Right now is us.",
        "Mallet: This should be a private moment. Do you want to take a walk?",
        "Dinah: Yeah.",
        "Mallet: All right. Hey, have a... have a good wedding. Again.",
        "Harley: You're so not into this.",
        "Gus: I just got a lot on my mind.",
        "Harley: Is it because it was Alan's idea? Because his food and his flowers and his stuff? Forget about that. Just think of it as something for us. Think of it as a gift for us. Please do this. Because I feel like I need to be closer to you now than ever before.",
        "Gus: Why is that?",
        "Harley: Because we've had a really bad two years, you know, that we didn't deserve. Entire families have been blown apart, and we're still standing here, stronger than ever. You and me. Isn't that a reason to celebrate something?",
        "Gus: You make it all sound so believable.",
        "Harley: So believe it. Let's do this for us. Let's do something for ourselves. Heck, why shouldn't we? Give me one good reason why we shouldn't. Just one. Baby, will you be my groom?",
        "Gus: Well, you'd... you'd have to be my bride.",
        "Harley: Okay, I'm thinking maybe I should change into something wedding-y, we have the minister waiting downstairs, and I don't think I should retie the knot dressed like this, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Minister: Let us begin, or rather, continue. Because you have chosen a life together based on love, respect and fidelity, tonight's ceremony simply serves as a reminder of how truly blessed your union is. That you, Gus, and you Harley, would rededicate yourselves to one another here like this, is proof that your love is not just strong but unshakable.",
        "Gus: Wait a second. Sorry, I can't do this.",
        "Harley: Hey, let it go.",
        "Gus: Let what go?",
        "Harley: Whatever it is. Rick, or Phillip, the past, the present. I don't know, whatever it is, we'll deal with it. Later. And, besides, you know, the past only has power over us if we give it power.",
        "Gus: Well, some things are manageable, but some things are just not get-over- able at all.",
        "Harley: I don't believe that. I won't believe that.",
        "Gus: Well, I wish I could say the same.",
        "Harley: Fine. You don't want me to tell you why I love you. Fine. I will tell him why I love you. I'm telling you why I love him. I love this man because... because he's my hero. Not obviously the Lancelot-type of hero, just a normal guy with quirks and flaws. Quirks and flaws that drive me crazy, like his habit of disappearing without telling me what's going on. The last time he did that, I thought it killed him. I thought... we all thought he was dead. And I wanted to stop living myself. And I felt like my whole future had been erased. And I just wanted to stop breathing. And I think I would have died, except for my kids. I couldn't leave them alone. But then he couldn't leave me alone either because he came back to me. And the day that I found him again, I found my future because my life is his life. And he's my best friend. And he's my partner in every way. He's my life. Somewhere deep inside me, I knew that the first time that we met. And I was right. Gus, God, I love you. You are my hero, the only hero I will ever want or ever need.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: You know, when I suggested a walk, I was thinking the beach; I was thinking moonlight. Breaking into a room wasn't really part of the picture.",
        "Dinah: It's only going to take a second.",
        "Mallet: This could get us arrested, okay.",
        "Dinah: Okay, look. Mallet, my father stayed in this room. I need to take one last look, just to see if I could pick up some traces.",
        "Mallet: Oh, man, this has go to stop. This has got to stop.",
        "Dinah: Okay, you know what? I'm going to do it myself.",
        "Mallet: No, that's no what I'm talking about. There is something I need to tell you I knew for a long time.",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Mallet: I knew Phillip was alive because I saw him in Springfield. And I even suspected that Rick helped cover the whole thing up. And I didn't say anything.",
        "Dinah: Why not?",
        "Mallet: Because Phillip was long gone, and it seemed like he wanted to stay that way. So I thought he wasn't a threat anymore to anyone.",
        "Dinah: So you figured it was better not to say anything at all?",
        "Mallet: I guess, yeah.",
        "Dinah: Why are you telling me this right now?",
        "Mallet: Because everything has changed with the picture of Phillip. It's proof now that he was involved in your father's death, if not actually behind it. And it put a whole new spin on it, and everything I know now really matters.",
        "Dinah: Why are you telling me, you could have said something earlier about my father, you could have said something and you didn't? I can't even believe you.",
        "Mallet: Listen to me, I'm just trying to be honest with you.",
        "Dinah: Congratulations, congratulations, Mallet. Do you feel better now that you unburdened yourself and landed this on me?",
        "Mallet: I know what keeping secrets does. It always turns out worse in the end.",
        "Dinah: Stop it.",
        "Mallet: Listen to me. We're going to hurt each other once in a while. We're going to make mistakes, and misinterpret stuff, that's just the way it is when two people are trying to be together. But the lying and secrecy only adds to the problem. I learned that by being with Harley.",
        "Dinah: Oh, yeah, which time?",
        "Mallet: Listen to me. When you went behind Harley's back, plotting with Alan- Michael and played that little secret back, you asked me if I could forgive you and I did. And now you need to ask yourself if you can forgive me. If you can, great, we can move on. But if you can't... those are your two choices.",
        "Dinah: Daddy wrote this letter and never sent it.",
        "Mallet: To you?",
        "Dinah: No, to you.",

        "Gus: I love you.",

        "Mallet: \"Dinah and I didn't get to know one another until she was an adult. But I like to think we're finally making up for lost time. I enjoy every minute with her now. I am so proud of her to having weathered a hideous, dark period in her life and emerged with such style and grace.\"",
        "Dinah: Oh, daddy.",
        "Mallet: \"You're a good man, Mallet, and you're good for Dinah. I could see that the first time the three of us were together. What you and Dinah have is solid and real. Vanessa agrees, by the way. She is very impressed with you. Don't get me wrong, no father likes to see himself surplanted in her father's mind, but I willingly place her in your hands. Take care of my little girl, A.C. She's a treasure, but I think you already know that. I look forward to seeing you both soon, Ross.\" \"A treasure.\" I think I know that.",

        "Harley: That's all you have to say. After my big speech. You love me.",
        "Gus: I've got a couple of things I've got to say.",
        "Harley: Okay.",
        "Gus: I'm still stuck on the quirks and the flaws bit.",
        "Harley: We're not going to start going over mine, are we?",
        "Gus: No, because when it comes to making mistakes, I'm definitely in the lead. I'm the guy that makes things happen that shouldn't be happening.",
        "Harley: It's a party, right?",
        "Gus: Kind of like New Year's Eve. Did I show up at the movie theater like I said I would at midnight? No. No. I vanished.",
        "Harley: You didn't do it on purpose.",
        "Gus: I should have just stuck with you.",
        "Harley: What? What? What?",
        "Gus: You wouldn't have needed anybody else to help you get through the pain. Instead, I was chasing my father around, and I just couldn't leave it alone.",
        "Harley: We can't rewrite history as much as we would like to.",
        "Gus: Well, that's a shame, isn't it?",
        "Harley: Hey, why are we going over this now? I mean, we're past all of that stuff, aren't we?",
        "Gus: Because I opened that door I shouldn't have opened.",
        "Harley: Baby, tonight is about moving forward. That future that I was talking about, the way I see it, it's full of love and happiness and more kids and grandkids.",
        "Gus: That would be nice.",
        "Harley: Well, it's there. It's right there for the taking, you know. So are we going to grab all of that good stuff together because I can't see my future without you in it.",
        "Gus: I can't see mine without you in it either, so...",
        "Harley: Okay. Let's do it.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: Right back where it belongs, like us.",
        "Gus: All right.",

        "Mallet: Dinah.",
        "Dinah: Are you taking care of me?",
        "Mallet: I'm trying. Does this mean you forgive me?",
        "Dinah: I have nothing to forgive you for. I can't stand to fly I'm not that naive I'm just out to find the better part of me I'm more than a bird I'm more than a plane I'm more than some pretty face beside a train and it's not easy to be me I wish that I could cry fall upon my knees find a way to lie about a home I'll never see it may sound absurd, but don't be naive even heroes have the right to bleed won't you concede that even heroes have the right to dream and it's not easy to be me but it's all right and all stems to tonight I'm not crazy",
        "Dinah: This is weird. I was telling Gus about how sad I've been because of daddy, how much I've been crying, but I also have to tell you that this is the happiest I've ever been in my entire life.",
        "Mallet: It's all going to be okay. I can't stand to fly I'm not that naive men weren't meant to rise in a silly red sheet I'm more than a man in a funny red sheet begging for kryptonite on a one-way street I'm more than a man in a funny red sheet I'm only a man look for his dreams I'm more than a man in a funny red sheet looking for special things inside of me inside of me inside of me inside of me inside of me inside of me inside of me I'm more than a man in a funny red sheet I'm only a man look for his dreams I'm more than a man in a funny red sheet and it's not easy to be me it's not easy to be me...",
