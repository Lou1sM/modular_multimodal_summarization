        "Jeffery and Harley anxiously await Eden's arrival at Salerno's. Jeffery told Harley that the drugs Eden was supposedly carrying were fake. Salerno frisked Eden when she got there, suspicious that she was up to something.",
        "Gus dragged Bill to his bachelor party. Edmund and Joey had a heart to heart about the Bauer Cabin incident. Joey told him nothing happened. Olivia made an appearance. HB spilled the beans about Bill being a stock wiz. Olivia made use of a very drunk Bill to try to find out if he had bought Spalding stock. Salerno told Eden that he owned her and she wasn't finished working for him. After he'd dismissed her, she snatched a key ring that had been hanging on the wall near the door. Later, she returned and let herself into Salerno's empty house, retrieved her bag, dumped the drugs and then left again."

        "Olivia: Look, all I know is that someone is snapping up Spaulding stock faster than I can get my hands on it. I thought I knew who it was. I'm not so sure. Here's an idea. You're the broker. Why don't you find out and make it fast. I have a company to take over.",
        "Phillip: All work and no play make Olivia a very dull wife.",
        "Josh: Hello. Hello. How are you? About time.",
        "Bill: About time.",
        "Sandy: Well, now we have a party on our hands.",
        "Josh: Yeah. About that. Bill came by the house earlier.",
        "Bill: You didn't tell him now. I want this to be a surprise.",
        "Josh: No, I didn't tell him.",
        "Bill: Okay.",
        "Josh: But it came up.",
        "Sandy: It turns out he's been giving you the slip, because he thinks you're throwing some sort of bachelor party.",
        "Bill: So my boy's trying to weasel out of this. Well, you know, I thought something like this might happen. So I've got myself a secret weapon.",
        "Sandy: Secret weapon?",
        "Bill: Yeah, yeah. You see, boys, now it's all in knowing your target and I know my son just about as well he knows that little Philly that he's getting hitched to.",
        "Eden: What's up? I thought you were out for the night.",
        "Bill: I was, but now I'm back. So you don't have to go to the gym.",
        "Eden: Well, I need to...",
        "Bill: You could burn off calories right here. Goodness, what do you have in this thing? It weighs a ton.",
        "Eden: Honey, don't open it.",
        "Bill: Why not?",
        "Eden: You know, it's just stinky old gym clothes.",
        "Bill: It's got to be tough to work out in 30 pound gym clothes. Come on.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, you know what? If she doesn't show in ten minutes, I'm sending the troops in.",
        "Harley: Okay. You need to relax, all right. She will be there. If I were Eden, I wouldn't be rushing in either. Because after she's done with Salerno, she's going to have to confront bill. And then Gus. You know what he's going to do when he finds out what his sister's been up to?",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, so I guess it's better that he remains in denial about who his sister is?",
        "Harley: No, he's not in denial about his sister. He just knows that she's been working hard to move past this life.",
        "Jeffrey: (Laughs) you're kidding. Ignorance is bliss.",
        "Harley: I'll tell you I would buy myself a little ignorance right now. I keep having visions of this eager-beaver cop pulling Eden over and getting an urge to check that gym bag.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, let them. Let them pull her over and let them check the bag, because she doesn't have anything illegal with her.",
        "Harley: What are you saying?",
        "Jeffrey: You heard me. What, you think I was going to risk having those drugs hit the streets? I switched it when I went down to my car to test it.",
        "Harley: Are you telling me that we just sent my future sister-in-law to meet a dangerous mob boss with phony drugs?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, exactly.",
        "Harley: Are you out of your mind?",
        "Bill: I guess the last thing your stock needs is a jolt of crummy PR. I mean it's tanking on its own pretty badly.",
        "Olivia: Are you following the Spaulding share price?",
        "Bill: Well, it's hard not to when the media is doing a story or a number on it every other day.",
        "Phillip: Not quite sure how I made the guest list, but...",
        "Olivia: What?",
        "Phillip: Maybe they felt sorry for me.",
        "Olivia: Because you're sick.",
        "Phillip: Yeah, that, too. Yeah, I'm tired. I think going to home. You coming?",
        "Olivia: You know what? I'd love to, but I have a few more hours of work here.",
        "Phillip: That's too bad. I was hoping we could spend some quality time together.",
        "Olivia: Rain check?",
        "Phillip: Okay.",
        "Joey: So, this is what guys do at bachelor parties, just stand around?",
        "Ross: Well, this is what guys do when the man of the hour is a no show. I think I'm going to check with Billy and find out what is holding up bill. And, Joey, if you're good, I'll tell you about my bachelor party.",
        "Joey: Cool. So how are you doing?",
        "Edmund: I've been better. You?",
        "Joey: I'm okay.",
        "Edmund: How 'bout your trip to the Bauer cabin? Was that okay, too?",
        "Joey: Yeah. Look, I can totally explain that. And just to let you know, nothing happened between us.",
        "Edmund: Look, Joey, it's all right. You brought Tammy home safely and that's all that matters. How is Tammy?",
        "Joey: She's still mad at her mom, I guess. And you for some reason. I really don't know the whole story.",
        "Edmund: You don't?",
        "Joey: Well, no, I know she's mad at her mom for reading her journal. And I don't know what you did that got her so fired up.",
        "Edmund: Well, I suppose she has her reason.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, I'd say it's time we get this guy a drink, huh?",
        "Josh: Gingerale, right?",
        "Shayne: Yeah, whatever.",
        "Josh: Gingerale or the hard stuff?",
        "Eden: Vinnie? Vinnie, are you here?",
        "Salerno: You're late.",
        "Eden: I got here as fast as I could. I have your stuff. Hey, that was not part of the deal. Get off of me!",
        "Salerno: Don't flatter yourself, darling. I'm just making sure it's you and me. Understand what I'm saying?",
        "Eden: You satisfied?",
        "Salerno: Just about.",
        "Eden: Here you go. You wanted a delivery, you got a delivery.",
        "Salerno: Not so fast. You're as nervous as I've ever seen you.",
        "Eden: So?",
        "Salerno: So, it's makes me wonder if something else might be going on here.",
        "Eden: Like what, Vinnie?",
        "Salerno: You tell me. And make it fast because I'm about a minute away from losing my patience. And trust me, you don't want that. (laughter)",
        "Olivia: What's going on with you? Guest of honor doesn't have a drink in his hand. Come on, bs, what kind of party you throwing him?",
        "Phillip: Honey, I thought you said you had a few more hours work to do? If I didn't know better, I'd think you were afraid to be alone with me. Hey, pal. Hey, why aren't you at bill lewis' bachelor party? Oh. Well, now see that's why I didn't go to med school. All that suffering and then more suffering. No, I'm still at the office. I just finished up a few things. No, actually I like it at night. It's quiet. I get a lot done. Listen, I wanted to see you. Do you want to hook up later for awhile? There's something I'd like to run by you. Hmm. No, I don't think I feel like waiting till 3:00. No, it's all right. You know what? It's not a big deal. I'll talk to you about it tomorrow.",
        "Alexandra: (Sighs)",
        "Phillip: Yeah. That's fine. Great. Aunt Alex, hi.",
        "Alexandra: Well, this is a surprise. And you are looking (laughs)...",
        "Phillip: Lucid?",
        "Alexandra: (Laughs)",
        "Phillip: Alert? Well dressed? What?",
        "Alexandra: All the above, darling. It so good to see you in this office. You have been sorely missed.",
        "Phillip: Well, perhaps by you and Alan. I have a feeling not by its current occupant.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, don't worry. You'll have this office back in no time at all. As this soon as this ridiculous investigation is finally over, you will be right back where you belong.",
        "Phillip: And Olivia?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, I have a nice, quiet, little cozy spot picked for her.",
        "Phillip: Really?",
        "Alexandra: Yes, it's down in the boiler room.",
        "Phillip: (Laughs)",
        "Alexandra: Well, what, darling? Really. She'll get all that exercise going up and down the stairs.",
        "Phillip: Aunt Alex, one of the many things that I have always adored about you...",
        "Alexandra: What?",
        "Phillip: You always have a plan.",
        "Alexandra: And you're saying you don't?",
        "Alexandra: I can't believe that I'm actually having fun. (Laughs)",
        "Phillip: Me, too.",
        "Alexandra: I just hate going home these days. It doesn't feel like home.",
        "Phillip: Really? Not for me. I couldn't wait to walk through that door, which my entire life I hated living in that house, but now I have to tell you, now it's home. Or I'm just getting old.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, hardly, dear, come on.",
        "Phillip: You know what it is? I think my kids are enjoying growing up there more than I did. (Laughs) I found James and Zach down the pantry today. They were stealing cookies, but they told me that they were taking them for the new little sister.",
        "Alexandra: Mm-hmm.",
        "Phillip: I'm not quite sure their motives were quite that pure.",
        "Alexandra: (Laughs) well, you have wonderful children, Phillip.",
        "Phillip: I do. I give their mothers all the credit.",
        "Alexandra: (Sighs) and a beautiful new little girl. I've always wanted a daughter.",
        "Phillip: That would be great.",
        "Alexandra: Mm-hmm. Raise any child would have been great, period.",
        "Phillip: It is. I'm sorry you had that taken from you. I know you miss being a mother.",
        "Alexandra: Heavens I still am a mother. I talked to nick. What, regularly. It's just not the same though.",
        "Phillip: I know you still Miss Lunacy.",
        "Alexandra: Yeah, that never changes. And every time I try to go to a quiet place, his face pops up in front of me. Just hi, mom. How are you doing? Fine. I want you to be happy. So you do. You get on with it. That's what you're supposed to do. You're supposed to get on with life. Yeah, I miss him. Everyday. It never goes away. Listen, darling, aren't you forgetting you're suppose to be somewhere?",
        "Phillip: There is no place I would rather be. Although there is a bachelor party.",
        "Alexandra: Uh-huh. Yeah, I know.",
        "Phillip: Bill lewis is having a bachelor party. I actually may pop by there on the way home or I may not.",
        "Alexandra: (Laughs) buzz said he was going to pop in himself at some point.",
        "Phillip: Oh, really?",
        "Alexandra: Yeah.",
        "Phillip: Well, maybe I'd better go then. You know, somebody's always got to look after buzz.",
        "Alexandra: (Laughs) he wasn't very enthusiastic about it. And I don't know why.",
        "Phillip: Well...",
        "Alexandra: I mean, he likes bill, but...",
        "Phillip: I'll tell you a little secret, Aunt Alex. Most men actually hate bachelor parties.",
        "Alexandra: (Laughs)",
        "Phillip: They do.",
        "Alexandra: Really?",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm.",
        "Alexandra: Well, I'll tell you a little secret, my dear. I've crashed a few of those bachelor parties in my day and for the most part they were very disappointing. Bachelor parties in my day and",
        "Phillip: There you go. I don't even know how I got invited to this. Bill and I are not exactly friends. And we became even less so when he was seeing Beth.",
        "Alexandra: You know, Beth is looking absolutely wonderful these days. And Lizzie's doing so much better you're home. I mean, Beth is looking very... especially wonderful these days.",
        "Phillip: Don't even think about it. I'm a married man.",
        "Alexandra: Of course you are, dear. Nothing wrong with having a backup plan is there? Just in case.",
        "Phillip: You know, I don't think Beth would appreciate being thought of as my backup plan.",
        "Alexandra: Of course not. What about a permanent plan? Permanent solution? Well, you can't blame a girl for dreaming can you, dear? Hmm? You two so belong together.",
        "Phillip: I have to live in the present. I have a little daughter that I have to take care of. And who knows, maybe we'll all just live together as one big, happy family. Stranger things have happened.",
        "Alexandra: Name one.",
        "Phillip: (Laughs)",
        "Lizzie: It's mine.",
        "Tammy: Wait, Lizzie. Hold up.",
        "Lizzie: What? I thought you wanted to go in there. Come on.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, but not like this.",
        "Lizzie: What? This is the best idea, okay. I can't believe I didn't think of it before now. Okay. Take a roomful of guys partying then you bring in a camera phone. We're going to have more fun then we're doing now, right? They're probably half drunk by now anyway. They're not going to care if we take pictures. We could have some great champagne, too.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, but we're not old enough to drink it.",
        "Lizzie: Have I taught you nothing?",
        "Tammy: Lizzie, let's just go rent some movies or something. This is too weird.",
        "Lizzie: Tammy, I'm going in there with or without you.",
        "Tammy: Without.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, so, you know, if Joey's getting a lap dance or something, I'll just take a picture of it for you.",
        "Tammy: Okay, yeah, let's go in. You know what? I've seen enough.",
        "Lizzie: Fine. Suit yourself.",
        "Ross: Olivia.",
        "Olivia: Ross.",
        "Ross: Imagine meeting you at Olivia's.",
        "Olivia: Oh, come on. Well, you saw me come in, right?",
        "Ross: Oh, yes, I did. It's hard to miss. Say, how is my nephew doing now that's he's out of the hospital?",
        "Olivia: He's fine. He's doing great actually.",
        "Ross: Oh, good.",
        "Olivia: You know what? I haven't had a chance to congratulate the soon to be ex- bachelor. So if you'll excuse me?",
        "Ross: Oh, yeah.",
        "Olivia: Hey. Oh.",
        "Bill: Olivia. I'm sorry. I was just looking at the thing.",
        "Olivia: I know. Do you have a second? I hope you don't mind, that I sort of barged in here. But, you know, that is my name...",
        "Bill: You did barge in here.",
        "Olivia: I did.",
        "Bill: That's okay. But I'm the man of the hour here and I probably need to make the rounds...",
        "Olivia: But I need to talk to you.",
        "Bill: ... And talk to everyone.",
        "Olivia: I think you need to sit down before you fall down, all right?",
        "Bill: Sit down. Whoa. Come here. Come here. You know what they say about lewis men?",
        "Olivia: What?",
        "Bill: They hold their liquor.",
        "Olivia: They do.",
        "Bill: They do.",
        "Olivia: I don't think so.",
        "Bill: That's right. That's right. That's right.",
        "Olivia: You need a chair.",
        "Bill: I think I do.",
        "Olivia: I'll show you where one is. Come on.",
        "Alexandra: Well, I guess we better be getting on home, huh?",
        "Phillip: I'm going to let you go ahead. And I will be right behind you, okay?",
        "Alexandra: All right, darling.",
        "Phillip: Clean this mess up and finish up a few last-minute things, and I'll be on my way.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, Phillip. Phillip, I want to thank you. I want to thank you for spending some time with me.",
        "Phillip: Hey. It was my pleasure. I'll see you at home. All right. See what Tokyo's doing with my stock. My stock has been sold. She is my power of attorney. I'll be damned. Hmm. Okay, honey, let's see what's in your portfolio. Oh, yeah, my access is denied? All right, my darling wife, just what in the heck are you up to now?",
        "Edmund: Well, quite the party, isn't it?",
        "Gus: Bored out of my mind. I wish I was home with my girl.",
        "Edmund: Hmm. Me, too. Well, care to play a hand?",
        "Gus: I'm playing solitaire.",
        "Edmund: Well, I thought we might have a game of go fish. No? All right. Red jack on black queen. Mr. O'Neill, I'm quite surprised you were invited to this party.",
        "Jeffrey: Actually, I just came in for a drink.",
        "Edmund: Hard day at work destroying more lives?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, what can I say? I must have found my calling.",
        "Edmund: If only it weren't in Springfield.",
        "Bill: Wait a minute. Where did everybody go?",
        "Olivia: We left the party, remember?",
        "Bill: Party?",
        "Olivia: You had too much to drink; you didn't want to embarrass yourself.",
        "Bill: Wait a minute. You telling me I said all that.",
        "Olivia: You sure did.",
        "Bill: No. I must be more sober than I...",
        "Olivia: Then you... then you what?",
        "Bill: I don't remember what I was going to say?",
        "Olivia: (Laughs) It's okay. Why don't you sit down? Sit.",
        "Bill: Huh? Where?",
        "Olivia: Over there. Anywhere you want.",
        "Bill: Oh.",
        "Olivia: You know, it's really a kick seeing you like this. Usually you're so together, so on top of your game and business and life.",
        "Bill: Nah, nah...",
        "Olivia: Come on, you're a pretty savvy guy, bill. And if I get you some coffee in you, you'll just dazzle me with your brilliance.",
        "Bill: No coffee. No coffee.",
        "Olivia: Come on, you're a brilliant guy, you know. I'm sure that you never let an opportunity slip through your fingers. Like the stock market for instance. I'm sure you play. I play. Bill, if we pull our resources.... bill?",
        "Bill: (Snoring)",
        "Olivia: It happens to me a lot."
