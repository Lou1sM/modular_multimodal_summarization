{"Episode Summary": [], "Recap": ["Cassie confronted Tammy and Joey about their time in the cabin. They bury the hatchet and Cassie gave her a new locking diary as a gift. Salerno tore through his house looking for the drugs Eden dumped. When Danny appeared, he zeroed in on him, accusing him of stealing from him. Thugs also arrived at Danny and Michelle's house to search for the drugs. Michelle called Danny asking to talk to Salerno and talked him out of completely trashing her house. Tony helped her clean up the mess.", "An extremely hung-over Bill refuses Eden's cure for a hangover. Eden lied about her whereabouts the previous evening. Then Jeffery showed up and questioned Eden about the drugs. He told her that he'd switched the drugs with the fakes and blamed her for setting the investigation back. Then he told her she'd have to testify against him. He then assigned Harley to be Eden's bodyguard. Bill grilled Harley about Eden. Danny found empty bags behind the toilet in the bathroom and sent Danny to kill Eden."], "Recap Author": "Silver Eagle Dreamer", "Show Title": "Guiding Light", "Transcript": ["Reva: Would you please sit down? You know how long it takes her to get ready for school.", "Cassie: She'd better hurry up. We're not going to have any time.", "Reva: There's plenty of time. It's still early.", "Cassie: Why are Tammy and I having problems now? She graduates in a few weeks; she's going to school in the fall.", "Reva: You know what? You've been lucky. And you're still lucky. And she's a good kid. It could have been a whole lot worse.", "Cassie: Yeah, you're right. You're right. I have no idea what I'm going to say to her.", "Reva: You'll figure out something.", "Cassie: Do you think something happened between her and Joey at the cabin? I mean, you saw them after they got back. (Doorbell rings)", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eden: It must have been some bash.", "Bill: Oh, it was. It was. My bachelor days went out with a real bang. Just remind me never to do that again.", "Eden: Whoa. You don't ever have to do that again. But I'm glad you got to do it this once.", "Bill: What? You're glad?", "Eden: It makes the wedding seem more real and like it's actually going to happen, you know.", "Bill: Hey, come here. What are you talking about? Okay, it's going to happen.", "Eden: I know.", "Bill: Hey, where were you last night? I thought you were going to be asleep when I came home, but you weren't even here.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Salerno: Who did it? Who betrayed me?", "Danny: Vinnie, hey, what's going on?", "Salerno: You want to act stupid, Danny, okay. But let me tell you something, all right. Nobody steals from Vinnie Salerno. Nobody!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: Who are you? What are you doing? No, stop right where you are. No, I want you out of my house now. Get out!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: What are you doing?", "Cassie: I was talking to Joey.", "Tammy: It sounded more like you were grilling him.", "Cassie: Don't talk to me like that, Tammy.", "Tammy: How do you want me to talk to you?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: Okay, excuse us.", "Cassie: Tammy Winslow!", "Reva: Excuse us a minute. Come. I think you may be getting off on the wrong foot.", "Cassie: Did you hear how she talked to me, Reva?", "Reva: She's a teenager. They get lippy.", "Cassie: Well, that's no excuse.", "Reva: Okay, take it from someone who's been there. You might want to change your approach.", "Cassie: Okay. Tell me how. How do I do that?", "Reva: You talk to her and then you listen to her.", "Cassie: I listen to her. What happened to my wonderful, sweet, loving little girl? Where is she?", "Reva: She's going through the change.", "Cassie: I thought that was menopause.", "Reva: Oh, hush. What I'm trying to say is that mama's little girl has grown up. Cassie, she's almost an adult.", "Cassie: Well, I wish she'd hurry up and get there.", "Reva: Hope for the best and expect the worst.", "Cassie: Well, that's encouraging.", "Reva: Yeah, well, that's the best I can do right now. But in the meantime, just don't go crazy.", "Cassie: Can we talk?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: If you're here to drag me home, you can just forget about it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: O'Neill, call me back. How are we supposed to do anything if I can't even get in touch with you? Call me. Hey, Tony Santos.", "Tony: What's up, Harley? How are you doing? Hmm?", "Harley: How are you doing? You look like you've got the weight of the world on your shoulders.", "Tony: Yeah, well, I haven't had my coffee yet.", "Harley: I'm on my fourth cup.", "Tony: Good for you. (Phone rings) excuse me. Do you mind?", "Harley: Yeah.", "Tony: Good. Thanks.", "Harley: I'll let you get that.", "Tony: Okay. Yeah, this is Tony. Well, you were supposed to call me before I started.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sandy: Harley cooper, my next poker victim.", "Harley: Hi, sandy. How are you?", "Sandy: Hung over. And I don't even drink.", "Harley: Hmm. Interesting.", "Sandy: Yeah, I was here for the bill lewis bachelor party last night.", "Harley: Oh. Did you have fun?", "Sandy: Yeah. But I don't think bill had such a good time.", "Harley: Really? (Laughs) why do you say that?", "Sandy: Well, when I congratulated him he mumbled something about taking a lesson from him and never doing what he did. And I don't know if he meant coming to the party or getting married.", "Harley: Well, he must have meant the party. Because bill is very excited about getting married.", "Sandy: Getting... wow! Must take a lot of guts to get married.", "Harley: Why does everybody in this town think that I'm the expert on marriage? I think there are people in this town that have been married a lot more times than I have, Sandy.", "Sandy: Well, how many are we talking here, Harley? Doesn't matter. Because I think it takes someone very brave to try it more than once. You know, if it at first you don't succeed and all that. It's better than getting all cynical and just shutting down. I hope I'm brave enough to try it once. Any advice?", "Harley: How about do as I say, not as I did? Sorry. Seriously. Okay. I think the one thing that you need if you want to have a successful marriage is trust. Trust is everything.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: It took you long enough.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: Tammy, your mother didn't come here to drag you home.", "Cassie: No, I'd like to talk.", "Tammy: Like we used to?", "Cassie: I'd like to try.", "Tammy: Things are different now.", "Cassie: No. Not really.", "Joey: Hey, I'm going to take off.", "Tammy: Joey's my ride.", "Reva: Joey, you know, I have some fresh baked muffins in the kitchen if you're hungry. Actually, I think I may go for one myself.", "Tammy: No, no, stay. Please?", "Reva: You don't need me here.", "Cassie: It's okay, Reva. I think you should stay. I understand why you felt like you needed to come here.", "Tammy: Then don't try to talk me out of it!", "Cassie: Would you stop assuming that that's why I came here? That's not why I'm here, Tammy.", "Tammy: I don't think we're ready for this.", "Reva: You might want to give it a shot.", "Cassie: I'll try if you'll try.", "Tammy: Okay.", "Cassie: I know that you are very angry with me.", "Tammy: You read my journal.", "Cassie: I'm so sorry that I invaded your privacy, Tammy. But if I had to do it over again, I would. Because I had to know that you were okay.", "Tammy: (Laughs) you are unbelievable.", "Reva: But you can still move forward. Sounds cheesy. I know. But that's what you have to do.", "Cassie: Reva's right.", "Tammy: I know.", "Reva: Well, get moving.", "Cassie: Oh, Tammy. I'm just so worried about you. You skipped school. You went up to the Bauer cabin with a boy. I mean, that doesn't sound like you.", "Tammy: Everyone was doing it.", "Cassie: That doesn't sound like you either.", "Tammy: That depends. I think you did it. I think you went to that cabin to get back at me somehow, to make me worry. I mean, is that it? Is that why you did it?", "Cassie: On what?", "Tammy: Did it work?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: What's going on?", "Jeffrey: Didn't your girlfriend tell you?", "Bill: Tell me what?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: Okay, Michelle. All right. She should be on there.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Salerno: Hello, Michelle.", "Michelle: Hello, Vinnie. I assume you're aware there are two gentlemen destroying my home as we speak.", "Salerno: I sent them.", "Michelle: That's what I thought. You know, Vinnie, with all due respect, if you were going to ransack our home, you could have done it yourself. Or you could have at least instructed your men to be careful. They're trashing my home. I have a lot of antiques, Vinnie, and some of them belong to my grandmother.", "Salerno: I'm sorry, Michelle, but you have to understand there has been a breach of my trust.", "Michelle: Well, I'm sorry, Vinnie, I don't understand. Why would you think of Danny?", "Salerno: Something was taken from me. I can account for everybody I work with... except for Danny.", "Michelle: Well, when did this happen?", "Salerno: Last night.", "Michelle: Well, it's impossible. He was home with me all night.", "Salerno: Just the same.", "Michelle: Did you ask him?", "Salerno: Hey, hey, look nobody talks to me this way, all right?", "Michelle: Well, nobody breaks bread at my table and then breaks my table, Vinnie. By the way, Vinnie, there's a safe in our house. Would you like me to show the goons where it is?", "Salerno: Okay. All right, Michelle, you win. Put Paulie on the phone, please.", "Michelle: Which one of you guys is Paulie?", "Paulie: Vinnie?", "Salerno: You find anything?", "Paulie: Nothing. You want us to keep looking?", "Salerno: No, why don't you get out of there?", "Paulie: Vinnie said take off.", "Michelle: Thank you, Vinnie. But my house is a wreck.", "Salerno: I send my apologies along with my maid.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: Apology accepted. You'd better send the maid. Tony.", "Tony: You got a complaint, Michelle? Why don't you take it up with me? These guys did a number on you, huh? Hmm? All right, look, Michelle, I know... I know you kicked me out last night, all right?", "Michelle: Yeah, and I told you not to come back until you figured out where your loyalties lie. You have nothing to say, Tony?", "Tony: What do you want me to say, Michelle? Come on, you let Danny back in, you invited Vinnie in your house. Look at this. What did you expect?", "Michelle: I expected this from Salerno. I didn't expect it from you, Tony.", "Tony: All right, well.", "Michelle: What are you going to do? You're going to stand there?", "Tony: Do you want my help, Michelle? Do you?", "Michelle: Are you afraid it's going to mess up your little manicure?", "Tony: Now you think I get a manicure?", "Michelle: I don't know. Isn't that what guys like you do?", "Tony: What do you mean, \"guys like me\"? What does that mean?", "Michelle: Just shut up and help.", "Tony: You're going to help me with this couch? Let's get this turned over. Hold on. Hold on. You know, you're not fooling me, Michelle, all right?", "Michelle: I didn't realize I was trying to fool you.", "Tony: Not just me.", "Michelle: And how am I trying to fool people, Tony?", "Tony: This. Right now. This. Acting tough. You're keeping this wall up while Danny's doing what's he's got to do, Michelle. This isn't you. All right? It's not you.", "Michelle: I guess you just didn't know me very well, huh?", "Tony: It's not the real you.", "Michelle: What's the real me, Tony? Huh? The woman who lectured her husband on morality? The woman who told Danny to play by the rules, because everything is going to work out?", "Tony: Pretty much, yeah?", "Michelle: Yeah, well, she doesn't exist anymore. Not after the year I've had with my dad and everything that happened with Carrie. Because she was wrong.", "Tony: What does that mean? Wrong about what? I don't understand.", "Michelle: The rules. See, because the rules keep changing. So now Danny has to make up his own rules.", "Tony: And you're going to stand by him no matter what, right?", "Michelle: Yes. Yes, I am.", "Tony: Okay.", "Michelle: I don't care if you respect me for it or not.", "Tony: Actually I've never respected you more, Michelle.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Salerno: Feisty little woman you've got there.", "Danny: Yeah, she is.", "Salerno: What is it, Danny? Come on.", "Danny: Well...", "Salerno: I can tell you want to say something. What is it?", "Danny: Yeah, Vinnie, I do. The next time you've got a problem with me, I'd appreciate it if you came to me and left my wife alone.", "Salerno: Danny, Danny, Danny. Come on, I had to be sure. What else was I supposed to do?", "Danny: Come to me first.", "Salerno: And give you a chance to cover your tracks?", "Danny: Vinnie...", "Salerno: Is that what you would have done if you were running things? Just as I thought. No hard feelings?", "Danny: No, Vinnie, no hard feelings. I don't have a problem following orders, but we had a deal that our families were off limits.", "Salerno: You have my word. Your family is my family.", "Danny: Okay. There's still a problem.", "Salerno: What problem?", "Danny: Well, Vinnie, I didn't steal from you, but somebody did. Any idea who?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sandy: Howdy, Bill. Looking good, partner!", "Bill: Okay. Shhh.", "Sandy: Oh. Sorry. Sweet party last night, man.", "Bill: Was it?", "Sandy: I was just keeping Harley company until you got here. She was giving me advice on love and marriage.", "Bill: Yeah, well, she's had a lot of practice.", "Harley: Well, thanks for keeping me company. It was fun.", "Sandy: Thanks for the words of wisdom.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Words of wisdom. I feel so old with him.", "Bill: Well, I hope you have some of those wise words left over for me.", "Harley: Well, I guess that depends. What do you want to talk about?", "Bill: What's going on with Eden?", "Harley: I don't know. What's going on with Eden?", "Bill: I don't know, Harley. I was hoping you could tell me. I left her with Jeffrey O'Neill. It was either that, or he was going to take her down to the station.", "Harley: Really?", "Bill: Yeah. I don't know. He had some questions about Vinnie Salerno or something.", "Harley: Well, she has a past with Vinnie Salerno.", "Bill: That's just it. A past.", "Harley: Yeah. But wasn't he sending her flowers and stuff like that?", "Bill: Yeah, well, I took care of that. I had a little talk with him. It was a one-sided deal. Eden had nothing to do with this.", "Harley: But maybe that's why Jeffrey is asking her questions, you know, about him.", "Bill: I don't know. I don't know. I mean, it's got to be more to it than that. I mean, why would he have to talk to her in private?", "Harley: I don't know.", "Bill: Harley, come on. You've been spending a lot of time with her.", "Harley: I don't know anything.", "Bill: Well, were you with her last night?", "Harley: Bill, you know what? I know nothing. And actually I got to go. I mean, I really shouldn't even have stayed this long. I've got to meet somebody. So...", "Bill: Harley, listen to me. I'm worried about Eden and if something happened, you've got tell me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eden: Do you know what you're asking me to do?", "Jeffrey: I have a pretty good idea, yes.", "Eden: There has to be another way. I will do anything...", "Jeffrey: Eden.", "Eden: ...To get Salerno. I swear that...", "Jeffrey: No, Eden. No.", "Eden: We have to find another way.", "Jeffrey: I'm sorry, no.", "Eden: (Sobs) you have to help me.", "Jeffrey: I can protect you, okay? I can do that. I can promise you protection.", "Eden: I don't want protection! I want bill. (Sobbing) I want my life.", "Jeffrey: We don't always get what we want, Eden. We can't have what we want all the time. I'll be in touch.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tony: Well, looks better, right?", "Michelle: Yeah. Thank you, Tony. You didn't have to do all that.", "Tony: Now you tell me.", "Michelle: Tony, did you tell Salerno that Danny was down at the warehouse? Is that why this happened?", "Tony: I didn't say anything, Michelle.", "Michelle: So you were loyal to Danny after all.", "Tony: You know, I remember... I remember when I first walked in this place. Danny wanted to give you the world, Michelle. You know that? I thought that... I don't know, I thought I'd have a place like this someday.", "Michelle: Well, someday I hope you will.", "Tony: Yeah. Well, listen, I'm going to... I'm going to get out of here. All right?", "Michelle: Hey, Tony.", "Tony: Yeah?", "Michelle: If I came across as superior or judgmental to you before, I didn't mean to. I've learned a lot about people in this past year, and you included, and I just hope we're always family.", "Tony: Family. I'll see you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: I found these stashed behind the cabinet in the bathroom. There was also some powder on the floor.", "Salerno: There was what?", "Danny: Yeah. Your shipment wasn't stolen, Vinnie. It was flushed down the toilet.", "Salerno: That little...", "Danny: Vinnie? You know who it was?", "Eden: We're done. You gave me my last job and I pulled it off, so excuse me.", "Salerno: I don't think so. Yeah, I know who it was.", "Danny: So, what are you going to do about it?", "Salerno: No, Danny. The question is, what are you going to do about it?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: Sorry. Come here. I had to put out a fire, or I tried to, anyway. It's still blazing.", "Harley: I know. I just saw bill.", "Jeffrey: What?", "Harley: He's almost convinced that something happened between Eden and Salerno last night.", "Jeffrey: Almost?", "Harley: I talked him out of it, almost. He said he'd drop it.", "Jeffrey: Well, let's hope for his sake that he does. When Vinnie Salerno finds out that Eden flushed his stash down the toilet, there's going to be trouble.", "Harley: She what?", "Jeffrey: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. New development: Eden panicked and decided she wanted to hurt Salerno any way that she could.", "Harley: Oh, no.", "Jeffrey: Oh, yes.", "Harley: Eden. Well, you have to protect her.", "Jeffrey: Yes, I know I have to protect her. Because she has to testify now.", "Harley: No. It could cost her...", "Jeffrey: I know what it's going to cost her, Harley. It's going to cost her everything. And she's aware of it, too.", "Harley: Everything, O'Neill.", "Jeffrey: At least she'll be alive, which is where you come in.", "Harley: Me? Why?", "Jeffrey: Yeah, because as of right now, you're Eden's new bodyguard.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: Next, on \"Guiding Light.\"", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Salerno: Keeping my house in order is as important to me as your family is to you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: Are you saying that if I don't kill Eden, you'll come after my wife and kid?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: Because whoever Salerno is after, like I said, it's business-related. But that's a good thing, because whenever he finds whoever it is he's looking for, it isn't going to be pretty.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Phillip: I see you're wearing the necklace I gave you.", "Olivia: Yeah. Of course I am.", "Phillip: Boy, they really did clean it up. Look how it sparkles. It almost doesn't look like the same piece."], "Transcript Author": ["By Boo Proofread By Linda"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrKQypXeqiE"}
