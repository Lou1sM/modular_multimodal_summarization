        "Ashlee: Here, let me.",
        "Jonathan: Hey. Do you see that? Then use that.",
        "Ashlee: But, but... wait, I'm legal.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, how much did this set you back? Hey! Put that down!",
        "Ashlee: What I...",
        "Jonathan: You are under age. I don't need another run-in with the cops.",
        "Ashlee: Oh, come on. I was grown up enough on prom night for you to spike my punch.",
        "Jonathan: Okay, you are a slow learner; you don't get the message. Everything about that night was a one-time only deal.",
        "Ashlee: Yeah, but thanks to you, I grew up a lot that night.",
        "Jonathan: Great.",
        "Ashlee: I realized that I didn't like just spending time with you to impress my snotty friends. I want more. A chance to show you how happy I could make you.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, you want to make me happy?",
        "Ashlee: Yeah.",
        "Jonathan: Get out. I have plans and they don't include you.",
        "Ashlee: But I really want us to be together.",
        "Jonathan: See ya.",
        "Ashlee: Is that really how you treat a friend? Especially one who knows about you and Lizzie Spaulding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Lizzie. Hey. Hey, come here. Look, I got here as soon as I could. What are you doing sitting out here? Don't you need to be in a room laying down or something like-- hey! Excuse me, can I get some help over here!",
        "Lizzie: Coop, stop.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, look. Sit down, sit down, sit down. Okay, look, these people are going to take care of you. All right. You just had a miscarriage.",
        "Lizzie: No. No, it was my mom's baby.",
        "Coop: But when you called, I just assumed that--",
        "Lizzie: What, that you were off the hook? Free and clear of me? I am so sorry to disappoint you, but our baby is just fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: So did Coop come back here after Lizzie's pseudo- engagement party?",
        "Ava: He did, and then he got a phone call and he had to take off.",
        "Tammy: Lizzie?",
        "Ava: Probably. It's not like we're together. He has responsibilities and so do I. The other plate is waiting in the back.",
        "Cassie: Ooh, I'm so excited, I think this is really coming together.",
        "Tammy: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: And, you know, I have the feeling that a lot of investors are going to show up for Josh's veteran's project.",
        "Tammy: Well, you know, when it comes to getting people to open their wallets, nobody beats Jonathan.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Honey, the idea is for them to give freely, not at gunpoint.",
        "Tammy: Don't start. Jonathan really wants to help out today and show that he's part of the family.",
        "Cassie: Well, that's good. And I hope he does, because this is a really important party and I don't want anything to mess it up.",
        "Josh: Excuse me, ladies. Have either one of you seen my wife? Because the guests are going to arrive any minute and I'm counting on her to sort of-- what?-- Wow them into a state of hyper-generosity.",
        "Cassie: Relax. Relax. She will be here. Reva would rather die than let you down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Hey, Doc, it's Reva Lewis.",
        "Colin: If you're calling to cancel...",
        "Reva: I'm not, but I am running late.",
        "Colin: Okay, this is chemotherapy, not a manicure.",
        "Reva: And this happens to be a very important day for my husband.",
        "Colin: Okay, I'll give you an hour to get hear. If you're not here by then, I'm giving your time slot to another patient.",
        "Josh: Ah-ha! There you are, you look gorgeous.",
        "Reva: Hi. Thank you.",
        "Josh: Put the cell phone away, come inside.",
        "Reva: Yes, sir.",
        "Josh: I need you, Reva.",
        "Reva: Right back at ya.",
        "Josh: Excellent.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Hello! Can I get an opinion here? What do you think? Button-down business woman, or sexy. Huh, huh?",
        "Gus: I don't know. Were you a button-down business woman or sexy when you decided to sleep with Mallet? I don't think it really matters. You look beautiful either away.",
        "Harley: Aw. That doesn't help at all. I mean, it's very sweet, but it doesn't help at all. Sexy it is.",
        "Harley: Honey, don't let me spend every nickel of Spaulding's money on Josh's project, okay? You know how easy I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: You think the way to get a guy to like you back is to put the squeeze on him? No wonder you're ordering pizza for one every night.",
        "Ashlee: I'm not a freak or some dumb little girl. If you give me a chance, I know I can prove that to you.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. You're not getting it. Watch my lips: I'm with Tammy.",
        "Ashlee: Yeah, yeah, but that could change when she finds out what kind of person you really are.",
        "Jonathan: She already knows what kind of person I am. She found out the hard way. She loves me anyway. There's nothing you can do to break me and Tammy up. And if you don't mind, I have a party to get to.",
        "Ashlee: Well, maybe I'll stay and have a beer.",
        "Jonathan: Out. Out, out. Go!",
        "Ashlee: Hi. Could I have a tequila sunrise, please?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Lizzie, wait! Wait... please, just wait.",
        "Lizzie: No. It is obvious you thought this was your way out, okay? That you were free. But you don't have to worry, okay, Coop? Because I am officially letting you go. Now let me go.",
        "Coop: Stop, stop. Just wait. Don't say another word about me not wanting our baby.",
        "Lizzie: Our baby? Like you care about it?",
        "Coop: I do care, all right. I just didn't realize how much until I thought I lost it.",
        "Lizzie: Really?",
        "Coop: Yes, really. Look, until your phone call just now, I thought the baby was more of an idea than the real thing. Even when I saw the sonogram, it was just weird because I looked and I saw this weird blobby looking thing on the screen, and all of a sudden it was a kid, let alone it was my kid. Somehow in the instant that I thought it was gone, it totally just suddenly turned into this real thing. Lizzie, I had a little son or a baby growing inside of you, and just like that it was gone. But then, when you said the baby was okay, that it was good... it is good, right? Yes?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah.",
        "Coop: Good. Thank you. Lizzie, I don't want you to lose this baby. It's my child; it's our child. I mean, do you understand what I'm saying here?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. You love it as much as I do.",
        "Coop: Yeah, I do.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, Coop.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Look at this, my three favorite women on the planet all working together. Those investors, they don't stand a chance.",
        "Tammy: You think Jonathan's going to be a no-show, don't you?",
        "Reva: Well...",
        "Tammy: Believe me, Aunt Reva, he will be here-- even if it's only to prove everyone wrong about him, again. Ha. See? We're connected like that.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs )",
        "Jonathan: Hey.",
        "Tammy: Hey. We were just talking about you.",
        "Jonathan: Let me guess, there was a fire in the kitchen.",
        "Cassie: Cute.",
        "Jonathan: Isn't this supposed to be the kind of party where you want people to open their checkbooks and give, give, give? Well, it won't work unless you give, give, give them a little lubrication first. Where's the booze? It's flowing like mud around here! I'm on it!",
        "Josh: Excuse me, ladies. ( Cell phone rings ) Yeah.",
        "Reva: Cassie, I have a favor to ask.",
        "Cassie: Okay.",
        "Reva: I know that we agreed to host this party together. But I'm going to have to leave for a little bit.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Is something wrong?",
        "Reva: No, no, nothing. In fact, it's really all good stuff. I have a line on a potentially major investor, a guy I used to work with in television, Dan Harrison. Have you heard of him?",
        "Cassie: Um, no.",
        "Reva: Well, major buckolas. The only problem is he's just here for a little bit, and I offered to meet him. So it's now or never.",
        "Cassie: Okay, well go.",
        "Reva: Okay.",
        "Cassie: And take his wallet while you're at it. ( Laughter ) And I will just stay here and make sure that Josh doesn't bring any shame to the family name.",
        "Josh: Excuse me?",
        "Cassie: Oh, and I believe it is time for the welcome wagon to roll.",
        "Josh: Listen, Reva, I heard you saying something to Cassie about going to see this-- what was his name?-- Harrison guy?",
        "Reva: Yes.",
        "Josh: Forget about that, I need you here, okay? And besides, is he more important than me?",
        "Reva: Nothing is more important than you.",
        "Josh: Thank you. Hello. It's good to see you. Welcome.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Well?",
        "Gus: Very nice.",
        "Harley: Nice? Nice is a card on your birthday from your aunt. I wanted to hear: \"Wow, every guy there is going to envy me when I walk in with this chick.\"",
        "Gus: It's so funny how women just love attention.",
        "Harley: I know what your problem is.",
        "Gus: Do you?",
        "Harley: Uh-huh. Phillip is still out there, and you can't do anything about it, and you hate that. I don't blame you, hon. Hey, I didn't sleep at all last night.",
        "Gus: That makes two of us.",
        "Harley: Is there anything else going on I should know about?",
        "Gus: I just think you're beautiful, and I'm... I'm just thinking in my mind I don't really like sharing you with anybody else.",
        "Harley: That's sweet. But it's just a party. A little party, and then I'm all yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: How is Alan taking the news?",
        "Lizzie: Its... it's hard to tell. Right now mom is acting like it's all his fault.",
        "Coop: How could Alan possibly be responsible for the miscarriage, though?",
        "Lizzie: Granddad.",
        "Coop: Sorry about the baby. I'll give you two some time.",
        "Lizzie: Why is mom so mad at you? I have a right to know what's going on. Besides, mom is going to tell me sooner or later.",
        "Alan: Your mother lost our baby because she was deeply upset.",
        "Lizzie: Why?",
        "Alan: Because of what she learned down at the island about your father. It was very shocking for her.",
        "Lizzie: She already knows every awful detail. Daddy's gone. You killed him.",
        "Alan: That's just it, Elizabeth. I didn't.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, you're back to that crazy lie again? No wonder mom's furious at you.",
        "Alan: I shot your father, but I did not kill him. He's alive. Your father is alive!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Hey, how you doing? Welcome. Thank you for coming.",
        "Tammy: Come on. Let's go raise some money. Hi.",
        "Jack: Hi.",
        "Tammy: I'm Tammy Winslow. I'm Josh Lewis's niece. This is Jonathan Randall.",
        "Jack: Jack McCauley, and I shouldn't even be here.",
        "Tammy: Why not?",
        "Jack: Well, these folks are big time. I just run a small customized bike shop.",
        "Jonathan: Wait, McCauley?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Jonathan: Like McCauley, like the hottest bikes in the world?",
        "Jack: If you say so.",
        "Jonathan: Yo, Jack, you and I can talk.",
        "Jack: Alrighty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Is that Jonathan I see working the room? Wow, I guess miracles really do happen.",
        "Reva: Yeah, speaking of which, Cassie, you know what I was the saying about the guy I need to meet?",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Reva: If I don't leave right now, I'm going to miss Harrison and his money.",
        "Cassie: Okay, well, go. I'll cover for you.",
        "Reva: Okay, good. Everything's going to be okay, sis. You just remember that, okay?",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Josh: Excuse me. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Look, okay, if you're going to do this-- if you're going to go see this Harrison guy, that's fine, but let me come with you, okay? I'll say hello to him, and--",
        "Reva: No, no. Sweetie, I really-- I have to do this alone.",
        "Josh: Okay. So it's going to be one of those meetings?",
        "Reva: Yeah.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Reva: But just remember, I'm doing it all for you.",
        "Josh: Thank you.",
        "Reva: You know, besides the fact that you're going to have some major money people here who are going to want to have face- time with the big cheese. So, you do your job and I'll do mine.",
        "Josh: Okay, Reva, darling, I'll catch up with you at home, all right?",
        "Reva: You know, if I'm asleep-- it's very possible that I could be-- I'm exhausted, and I think I'm going to turn in early.",
        "Josh: I have ways of reviving you.",
        "Reva: Really?",
        "Josh: Really.",
        "Reva: Great. Okay. I'll see you then.",
        "Josh: Good luck.",
        "Reva: Hi, guys.",
        "Gus: Hi.",
        "Cassie: Hello, Harley, you look fabulous.",
        "Harley: Oh, my gosh. That's a compliment. Get ready for the sales pitch.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. All right, well, so you want the short version or you want the full court press?",
        "Harley: I want to talk about that later and spend a little time talking to my friend who I haven't seen in a really long time. Excuse us. So, how's Jeffrey?",
        "Cassie: Wow. Wow, we really haven't talked in a really long time, have we?",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Cassie: Um...",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Cassie: Jeffrey is pretty much receding into the past already. I don't know, the quicker, the better, I guess. Because I... I don't know, maybe somebody else would have been able to handle it better, but for me, once the trust was broken, I just couldn't get past it.",
        "Harley: I don't blame you. I don't blame you. Trust is everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lynn: Hi, Gus. Would you like some wine?",
        "Gus: Thanks.",
        "Josh: So, Gus, what's your secret?",
        "Gus: Hmm?",
        "Josh: I mean, with Harley. I'm just asking, how do you keep your wife by your side like that, because my wife right now has gone fishing. Pig in a blanket?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse: Mrs. Lewis?",
        "Reva: Reva.",
        "Nurse: I know, I used to watch your tv show. Now, we're not exactly formal here, so you can change in here.",
        "Reva: I may be sick.",
        "Colin: Usually patients say that after the chemo.",
        "Reva: I bet you didn't think I was going to make it.",
        "Colin: Actually, I didn't give it much thought one way or the other.",
        "Reva: Well that's comforting.",
        "Colin: You're not my only patient, Mrs. Lewis.",
        "Reva: Do all of your other patients find these sickly blue robes to be as disgusting as I do? I prefer red, the brighter the better.",
        "Colin: I'll make a note of that in your chart. Look, you don't have to put on an act for me.",
        "Reva: An act?",
        "Colin: Pretend like you're not concerned, you're not worried about the outcome.",
        "Reva: I'm not doing anything for you, Dr. McCabe. What I am doing, and I'm doing it the best possible way to beat this disease, is for me and my family. So that we can go on with the rest of our lives, just like your poster says.",
        "Colin: Good.",
        "Nurse: All ready, Doctor.",
        "Colin: Good. Let's start. Isn't it strange how life can change-- ooh, in a moment my God, it's strange how life can change in a moment...",
        "Reva: So far, so good.",

        "Ron Raines, \"Inside The Light.\" We hope Alan is going to see the light. He's inside the light. I enjoy teaching, whatever I've learned, passing it on and connecting. I think many people would be surprised to know that I am basically a simple guy. See Alan, Wednesday, May 24th, \"Inside The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: How about them Cubbies? This just might be the year for them, you know? They have a shot at it. I would love it, just once in my lifetime.",
        "Colin: I'm not that big a fan of baseball.",
        "Reva: Why am I not surprised? So what do you think about puppies and young children? Are they on your grinch list, too?",
        "Nurse: Mrs. Lewis, try to relax.",
        "Reva: It's a little difficult with that fluid dripping into my arm. Sure you have the right bag there? Sure it's not embalming fluid? ( Laughs ) That was hospital humor.",
        "Colin: Nurse, you can go.",
        "Nurse: You'll be okay.",
        "Reva: No, don't leave me! Please, come back soon!",
        "Colin: Relax. Let the cocktail work.",
        "Reva: \"Cocktail\": Now, that's a word that will never mean the same thing again. So, Doc, how about you tell me what I have to look forward to? You could serve that straight- up.",
        "Colin: All right. Let's talk about what you can expect the morning after.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Daddy is dead. We had a funeral. We buried him in the Spaulding crypt. I still take flowers there.",
        "Alan: I know this is very shocking for you...",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, it's shocking, but I really miss him. But the person that he became... I don't want him anywhere near my baby.",
        "Alan: That's why he disappeared, because of all of the damage he did. That's why he wants to stay as far away from Springfield as possible. He still feels that way.",
        "Lizzie: How do you know that?",
        "Alan: Well, I mean it's the only logical...",
        "Lizzie: No, no, I don't buy that.",
        "Alan: Sweetheart, you're just upset right now.",
        "Lizzie: No. Somebody had to have helped him. Who was it, Granddad? I know you know the answer to every question, so tell me this one. It was you. No wonder mom doesn't want to see you. She figured it out, didn't she? That's why she freaked out. That's why she miscarried, because of you.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth...",
        "Lizzie: No, I don't want you near me. I don't want you anywhere near me or my baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: The way I see it, this is the kind of project where nobody loses; everybody wins. First and foremost, of course, the veterans.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I've never seen Uncle Josh this excited about a project.",
        "Jonathan: Check out the look on your mom's face. She's totally digging this, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Honey, how much do you think Spaulding should contribute to Josh's project?",
        "Gus: I think that's way too much.",
        "Harley: Did you hear a word I said?",
        "Gus: I heard every one of the words that you said. Oh, look who it is.",
        "Doris: I need to speak with you or your wife, take your pick.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: What's Ashlee doing here with the district attorney?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Could you excuse us for just a minute, please? Ms. Wolfe, my wife is not here. And in case you haven't noticed, I'm sort of in the middle of something important right now.",
        "Doris: Well, this cannot wait. There he is.",
        "Josh: Oh, no.",
        "Cassie: Doris, this is a private party.",
        "Doris: Private party, I see, to raise money. Oh, well... I don't know who would invest in you when your family brazenly flouts the law.",
        "Josh: Excuse me, what are you doing?",
        "Ashlee: Can we just go?",
        "Doris: Absolutely not.",
        "Josh: Can you just answer my question, please? What the hell is going on?",
        "Doris: Harboring a criminal is a felony, Mr. Lewis.",
        "Josh: Me?",
        "Doris: Is that him? Is it? Selling alcohol to minors is illegal in every state. Ashlee is 17, and she was just picked up for a DWI immediately after leaving your bar today.",
        "Jonathan: Whoa. Whoa, no. She did not drink anything in my place. I kicked her out myself.",
        "Doris: There are several witnesses. The bartender served her many beers.",
        "Jonathan: Did you go back?",
        "Doris: Oh, please. Spare us the theatrics. This is not the first time you got this young lady drunk. You took her to her high school prom and plied her with liquor. There are several witnesses to that, too.",
        "Tammy: Ashlee was already drunk when she got there. This was not Jonathan's fault.",
        "Doris: That's fine, but what about the...?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Say something to Doris? Look at me. Are you high?",
        "Gus: Looking for these?",
        "Harley: Oh, let's go.",

        "Cassie: The charges are ridiculous!",
        "Jonathan: She is just a kid looking for attention. That's why she does things like this. What's your excuse?",
        "Doris: She's my daughter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colin: We're almost done.",
        "Reva: Good, I can get out of here. With any luck, Josh's party will still be going on.",
        "Colin: You're not leaving so fast. I need to monitor you for a while.",
        "Reva: But you said I may not even have a reaction at all the first time.",
        "Colin: I said every patient is different.",
        "Reva: I read the pamphlets, I know the side effects. I know what could possibly go wrong. I also know that staying positive and active can make me feel as good as I can. Maybe I will be one of the lucky ones...",
        "Colin: And what if you're not? How do you plan to keep your secret from your husband when the expected side effects happen? Because they will.",
        "Reva: That depends. How do you feel about redheads?",
        "Colin: What? You trying to set me up with one of your friends?",
        "Reva: No, no, no. ( Laughs ) I went by this wig store, and I saw this spiffy little wig, and I thought maybe when I go all Michael Jordan, I thought I could buy it and wear it and tell Josh I'm going for a new look.",
        "Colin: You have a real talent for being devious.",
        "Reva: You have no idea.",
        "Colin: This is going to be tough, Reva, and doing it alone-- it has been done before, people keeping their condition secret from the world-- but you are going to be sick.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, I may feel sick, but I refuse to be a sick person. Okay? Do you think I like keeping the truth from the one person I'm closest to in this world? I have cancer, and I would tell him that in a heartbeat if it weren't the worst possible time for him right now. He's putting together this project that is his whole life's dream come true for him, you know? And he would give it all up. He would give up that dream, he would put all of his time and all of his energy into me if I -- if he knew I was sick, and I won't do that to him, not this time. Not telling him about this isn't out of fear, Dr. McCabe; it's out of love. Can you possibly understand that?",
        "Colin: Well, I... we're... yeah, well, we're done here. I'm going to get the nurse. For the record, I did like a redhead once, an Irish Setter named McGraw-- a cute dog.",

        "Lizzie: Keep away from me.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, everything I did, I did to protect your father and this family. You must believe that.",
        "Lizzie: I had a right to know that my father was alive.",
        "Alan: Yes.",
        "Coop: What?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, yeah, yeah, daddy didn't die. He was part of some conspiracy to keep it a secret.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, that is not...",
        "Lizzie: I am so happy that my baby is going to grow up with Coop as its father. Maybe that will keep it from being as screwed up as the rest of his family. You should go. Go!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Officer...",
        "Jonathan: What the hell is this?",
        "Doris: This is an arrest. The district attorney's office is pressing charges.",
        "Tammy: He didn't do anything.",
        "Jonathan: Tell her I didn't force you to drink at the prom and I didn't let you drink at my bar today.",
        "Cassie: You went out with her?",
        "Tammy: Mom, please.",
        "Ashlee: Mom, can we go home?",
        "Doris: We're going home, and he is going to the police station.",
        "Josh: Folks, I'm sorry about this. We'll reschedule. Thank you very much.",
        "Doris: Good luck with your project.",
        "Josh: Thanks.",
        "Cassie: I should go with Tammy, but I hate to leave you.",
        "Josh: It's fine. In fact, I think the best thing I can do is contact Reva and tell her about her son's latest run-in with the law. So just go. I'll be fine.",
        "Cassie: I'll call you.",
        "Josh: Okay.",

        "Gus: Yes, mommy.",
        "Harley: Oh, I'm not your mommy. I'm just your wife. The one who sat through every minute of that 48-hour detox hell, and listened to you swear up and down you could break your painkiller habit, and if you had so much of a craving for a pill, you would go right back to rehab.",
        "Gus: Stop. Stop! You had me at \"I'm not your mommy.\"",
        "Harley: It's not charming, Gus. Hey, listen to me. What are you doing? Why are you doing this? Listen to me. You got yourself cleaned up. Things were going our way. What's going on? What is this?",
        "Gus: Shh. Stuff happens, and, believe me, not just to me.",
        "Harley: Just give me a straight answer. Why are you trying so desperately to ruin a good thing?",
        "Gus: How is it possible that I'm the one that ruined everything, when you have been the one to blow everything to hell?! How is it possible?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: We ought to get you home to rest. Come on, I'll take you.",
        "Lizzie: Coop, if it wasn't for you, I would end up just like all of them.",
        "Coop: Stop. Stop. Don't. Lizzie, you are nothing like Alan, all right? Besides, you've got a little more company now. ( Cell phone ringing )",
        "Coop: Speaking of company, this is my dad. Hold on one second. Hello.",
        "Ava: Is everything okay?",
        "Coop: Lizzie's mom had a miscarriage.",
        "Ava: That's so... I don't know what to say.",
        "Coop: It kind of made me think about my own baby, if something had happened to it. I don't know, I would just feel...",
        "Ava: Of course. The baby is a part of you. How's Lizzie?",
        "Coop: She's hanging in there. Look, I should probably get going.",

        "Nurse: The doctor wanted to talk to you before you leave.",
        "Reva: I'm fine. It's really okay. Whoa! It's okay. Maybe the doctor was right. Maybe it wouldn't hurt to just sit and rest a little bit longer.",

        "Cassie: Listen, lady...",
        "Doris: He's not going to skate by on this one. Let's get him booked.",
        "Cassie: Doesn't he at least get a phone call?",
        "Doris: Later, much later. I'm going to take my sweet time finding a judge for the bail hearing, just so you know.",
        "Tammy: Wait, Jonathan. Call Jeffrey, call Josh, call anybody who can help get him out of here. Mom, he didn't get Ashlee drunk. He was just trying to help her.",
        "Cassie: Right, of course not. Jonathan can't be at fault. No. Josh's party for the project of a lifetime just happened to go bust. Jonathan had nothing to do with it.",
        "Tammy: He was trying to help. You know he was. You saw him.",
        "Cassie: Honey, we're all trying, but there are limits.",
        "Tammy: So you're not going to help him?",
        "Cassie: I will do what I can. But, Tammy, when Jonathan gets out of here, he cannot have anything to do with Josh's project.",
        "Tammy: And you expect me to keep him away from it? Fine. No problem. Josh won't have anything to worry about from Jonathan, I promise.",

        "Gus: I have reasons. I have reasons why I don't want to feel anything, okay? Taking a couple of these little babies, they work. You know why? Because they put me nowhere. Nowhere. Nowhere is where I would rather be than be here with you!",
        "Harley: Well, I'm so glad I've been such a comfort to you through this whole thing, Gus. Let's start at the top of the list, okay? Is your leg hurting you again?",
        "Gus: No, no, it's not my leg.",
        "Harley: What is it then?",
        "Gus: It's not my leg, it's not my arm. It's none of that stuff.",
