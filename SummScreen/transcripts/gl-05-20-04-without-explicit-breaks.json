        "Olivia: Wow. This is a perfect copy of my \r\nnecklace. You really outdid yourself, Mr. Carson. ",
        "Phillip: Oh, I was just looking to see... \r\nyou're not wearing that necklace that I got you. ",
        "\r\nOlivia: No, no, I'm having it cleaned. If I'd known you were coming home, I \r\nwould have picked it up. You caught me off-guard. Thanks for getting it to me so \r\nquickly. It really was an emergency. ",
        "Jeweler: I'm glad you're pleased with it, \r\nMrs. Spaulding. Wear it in good health. ",
        "Phillip: Pardon me. That beautiful diamond \r\nnecklace you just gave that woman. Did you make it? ",
        "Jeweler: Stunning, isn't it? ",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Jeweler: You'd never guess it was a fake.\r\n",
        "Phillip: Yeah, you're right. I never would.\r\n",

        "Eden: Where are you going, honey? ",
        "Bill: I just have to go. ",
        "Eden no, no, no. Where... no. ",
        "\r\nBill: All right, listen to me. If you must know, okay, I will tell you. I'm \r\ngoing to go pick up a bottle of wine, I'm going to go pick up some dinner from \r\ntowers and we are going to have our own little candlelight dinner right here.\r\n",

        "Robbie: When is daddy coming home? \n",
        "\r\nMichelle: I'm not sure, sweetie. You know those men that were here earlier \r\ntonight? They played a mean trick on us by messing up our house, so daddy is \r\nplaying a trick back on them. We just have to hope that he does a really good \r\njob of pretending and fools them really, really well. ",
        "Danny: You want me to kill Eden august?\r\n",
        "\r\nSalerno: The chick stole from me, Danny. She flushed my dope down the toilet. \r\nWhat, am I supposed to turn a blind eye? ",
        "Danny: No. ",
        "\r\nSalerno: No. Just like I can't let one of my guys refuse an order. There are \r\nrules. Keeping my house in order is as important to me as your family is to you.\r\n",
        "Danny: Are you saying that if I don't kill \r\nEden, you'll come after my wife and kid? ",
        "Salerno: Danny, it pains me to even think of \r\nit, but we've all got to follow the rules. ",
        "\r\nDanny: Vinnie, you have my loyalty, you know that. But we have a deal. If you so \r\nmuch as touch a hair on Michelle or Robbie\u2019s head... ",
        "\r\nSalerno: Come on, Danny. Danny, Danny, why would I do that? We're one big family \r\nhere. Same goals, same dreams. You said you would do anything to work your way \r\nback into the business. I'm just giving you a chance to prove it. Go home, think \r\nabout it, all right? Call me back tonight. Say hello to that lovely wife for me.\r\n",

        "\r\nOlivia: Hi, it's Olivia. Did any more stock go on sale before the market closed \r\ntoday? Yeah, I know what you said. I was just hoping that... (Sighs) well, I'm \r\ngoing to have to get it some other way. Well, somebody's figured it out because \r\nthey're snatching it up before I can. No, I have a pretty good idea who it is. \r\nLook, I'm getting another call, okay? I have to go. Bye. Hello? ",
        "Phillip: Hi. It's your husband. ",
        "Olivia: Phillip, hi. ",
        "Phillip: Where are you? ",
        "Olivia: At the beacon. Why? ",
        "Phillip: Oh, that's perfect. Why don't you \r\nmeet me at the bar in a half an hour-- the one with your name on it? ",
        "Olivia: What's going on? ",
        "\r\nPhillip: Oh, you know, I'm just... I'm tired of this tension between us. Why \r\ndon't we have some dinner, a little wine, try to reconnect, see if we can't \r\nremember all the things that are right between us and why we fell in love in the \r\nfirst place. What do you say? ",
        "\r\nOlivia: Sounds lovely. But I don't think I can take a break. You know, I have \r\nall this paperwork that I need to catch up on. I've been avoiding it for weeks.\r\n",
        "\r\nPhillip: Oh, that's too bad. Actually, I was sort of hoping to discuss a little \r\nbusiness with you about Spaulding as we go down the line, and your ongoing role \r\nwith the company, but that's okay. We can do it another time. ",
        "Olivia: No, if it's that important to you, I \r\ncan put my paperwork off for another day. ",
        "Phillip: Are you sure? ",
        "Olivia: Positive. I'll meet you in a half an \r\nhour. ",
        "Phillip: Great. Can't wait. ",
        "Olivia: Me, too. Bye. ",
        "Phillip: Bye. ",
        "Olivia: A little wine, a little dinner. What \r\nare you doing, Phillip? ",

        "\r\nJosh: Hey. Excuse me. I was under the impression you moved out of this house. \r\nYou want to give me your keys right now? ",
        "Shayne: No, thank you. What happens if I get \r\na little hungry and there's no food in our fridge. ",
        "Josh: Oh, yeah. That's the only reason to \r\ncome over here now, right? To eat? ",
        "Shayne: Well, actually not this time. \n",
        "\r\nSandy: No, no, no. This time it's all about the never-ending move. I thought \r\nwomen were bad with the stuff, but this guy is the worst. ",
        "Shayne: Hey, hey. It's sports equipment, \r\nokay? It's sports equipment. Dad? ",
        "Josh: Yeah? ",
        "Shayne: I hope you didn't throw out those \r\nboxes of old mitts and bats that I have in the back of my closet. ",
        "\r\nJosh: No, no. Of course we didn't throw that stuff out. Your mother's going to \r\nturn all that stuff into the Shayne lewis shrine one day, I'm sure. She's \r\nfeeling a little sentimental these days. ",
        "\r\nShayne: Well, she can have it all after the summer's over. I need all the stuff \r\nfor the fifth street baseball summer program.. some of the kids can't afford \r\nequipment, so I'm going to bring my old stuff. ",
        "Josh: That's great. That's very nice of you. \r\nI guess the shrine is going to have to wait, then. ",
        "Shayne: And you can actually hang out until I \r\nfigure out how many boxes there are. ",
        "Josh: (Laughs) ",
        "Sandy: Can I? ",
        "Shayne: Yes, you may. What is this? \n",
        "Josh: I think they're... it's from Paris. I \r\nthink they're gifts from your sister. ",
        "Sandy: Ooh. Did Marah send us anything?\r\n",
        "Josh: I don't know. I think it's mostly \r\nwedding presents for bill and Eden. ",
        "Sandy: Ah, the wedding. My first big family \r\nwedding. ",
        "Josh: Ooh, lucky you. ",
        "Shayne: Well, see, usually it's daddy and \r\nmommy getting married. ",
        "Josh: Yeah, well, this time it happens to be \r\nbill and Eden\u2019s turn. ",

        "Tony: This is a private club, bill. \n",
        "Bill: Tony. ",
        "Tony: Don't do this. Not now. Do you \r\nunderstand that? Don't do this. I'm telling you. ",
        "Bill: Listen, I told half the town I'm coming \r\nover here, so if anything happens to me... ",
        "Tony: If anything happens to you, bill, it's \r\nbecause you asked for it. I'm not here to help, all right? ",

        "Harley: Hey, Eden. I thought we could go over \r\nsome wedding plans. ",
        "Eden: It's okay. Bill's not here. He's out \r\ngetting us dinner or stewing, or both. ",
        "Harley: Did you guys have a fight? \n",
        "\r\nEden: He saw how anxious I was and his mind immediately went to Salerno. But I \r\nconvinced him it was just pre-wedding jitters. I think. ",
        "Harley: Are you sure? ",
        "Eden: Yeah. ",
        "\r\nHarley: I just mean, if bill didn't buy your story, if he goes and confronts \r\nSalerno, I mean, given what you just did to the guy... ",
        "Eden: O\u2019Neill told you? ",
        "Harley: O\u2019Neill told me. And we are really \r\nconcerned about your safety, Eden. ",
        "Eden: I'm concerned about my safety. \n",
        "Harley: Okay. O\u2019Neill has assigned you a \r\nbodyguard. Me. You okay with that? ",
        "\r\nEden: Are you kidding? I would have you move in here, but bill would get \r\nsuspicious. Oh, Harley, I hate lying to him. ",
        "Harley: I know. I've been doing a lot of \r\nlying to your brother the last few days. ",
        "\r\nEden: More than the last few days. You thought for a while I was involved with \r\nVinnie's drug operation. Why didn't you say anything to Nicky? ",
        "Harley: I wanted to wait until I was sure.\r\n",
        "Eden: And now that you are? ",
        "Harley: Let's just get through what's in \r\nfront of us. Okay? And then we'll see where it stands. ",

        "Sandy: So, brother, you sure you don't need \r\nmy help up there? ",
        "Shayne: That's quite all right. The guy has \r\nquestions about everything and he screws up my process. ",
        "Josh: Oh, that's a terrible thing, isn't it? \r\nYour brother wanting to know more about you. ",
        "Shayne: I'm going to holler when I need some \r\nmuscle, okay? ",
        "Sandy: All right. You see, that's pretty \r\ncool, seeing him fly around like that. ",
        "\r\nJosh: Yes, it is. That's how he was as a kid, you know? He never walked \r\nanywhere. He always ran or galloped or whatever. And of course, all that \r\nstopped. ",
        "Sandy: But now he's back. ",
        "Josh: Yes. ",
        "Sandy: In full effect. ",

        "Sandy: Well, he's been a great brother to me.\r\n",
        "\r\nJosh: I think it was a good thing for him to have somebody around that needed \r\nhim at a time when he felt so helpless. A lot of us... I was guilty of this, you \r\nknow? We got so focused on trying to get him to walk again that we sort of \r\nsuffocated him, made him feel like he didn't have any purpose. But you helped \r\nhim. That's why I'M... especially now that Marah's not around, I'm glad that \r\nyou're here for him. ",
        "Sandy: Well, thank you, josh. ",
        "\r\nJosh: It's funny how things work out, isn't it? I was just thinking about how \r\nwhen we first found out about you, I wasn't quite sure that you were going to \r\nfit into this family. ",
        "Sandy: Yeah. Now? ",
        "\r\nJosh: Oh, now you're stuck with us, (Laughs) whether you like it or not. You are \r\na full-fledged member of this family now. ",

        "Eden: You know? ",
        "\r\nGus: Yeah. He's on a rage. He's on a tear. Nobody on the street knows exactly \r\nwhat put him there, but anybody who's been connected to him is beating it out of \r\ntown, but quick. ",
        "Harley: But they don't know who really set \r\nhim off? I mean, that's what I hear. ",
        "\r\nGus: Yeah. They don't know. You have nothing to worry about, though, because \r\nwhatever it is, it's business-related. ",
        "Eden: I know. I just... ",
        "Gus: You just got a little scared. Right? You \r\ncalled your girl here. But you should have called your big brother. ",
        "\r\nHarley: She didn't call me. I heard rumblings about Salerno on the street, so I \r\ncame here to fill her in and see if she was okay. ",
        "\r\nGus: Really? Well, that makes you lucky, doesn't it? I mean, not only do you \r\nhave a bridesmaid, but you got yourself a bodyguard. (Laughs) ",

        "Gus: Yeah. ",
        "Eden: Yeah. ",
        "\r\nGus: You got nothing to worry about, honey, because whoever Salerno is after, \r\nlike I said, it's business-related. But that's a good thing because whenever he \r\nfinds whoever it is he's looking for, it isn\u2019t going to be pretty. ",

        "\r\nBill: Look, Vinnie-- may I call you Vinnie? All right, look, I know that you and \r\nEden knew each other a while ago. Okay, I don't know what the relationship was \r\nand, really, I don't care. But what I do know is that she is with me now, and \r\nshe is going to be my wife. And she is the toughest, bravest woman that I know, \r\nbut lately, for some reason, the mere mention of your name puts her in a real \r\nstate. Okay? She is scared. ",
        "Salerno: Scared of me? Did she say why?\r\n",

        "\r\nDanny: It's nothing like that. I'm just... I'm getting a feeling, that's all. \r\nI'm getting a feeling that things are coming to a head. Vinnie's in a rage.\r\n",
        "Michelle: Yeah, no kidding, Danny. The way he \r\nsent those thugs here to destroy our home. ",
        "Danny: Michelle, he thinks that someone stole \r\nfrom him and double-crossed him. ",
        "Michelle: But he knows it wasn't you now, \r\nright? ",
        "\r\nDanny: Yeah, he does, but Michelle, he's not thinking straight and if he goes \r\noff again, I don't want him or his thugs coming back into our house. ",
        "Michelle: Or coming after our son. \n",
        "Danny: Right. How was Robbie when Salerno's \r\nguys were here? Was he... was he upset? Was he afraid? ",
        "\r\nMichelle: I told him that the grownups were all playing a game and he could \r\nplay, too, by going up into his room and hiding. So he wasn't really here for \r\nmost of it. ",
        "\r\nDanny: Good. Michelle, there can't be a next time. There can\u2019t. Honey, we've \r\ndone everything we can to protect ourselves and the people we care about. We got \r\nyour father out of town. We got Nico out of here. We've pushed everyone else \r\naway. But we knew that this was coming. I'm sorry. Robbie cannot stay with us \r\nright now. It's not safe.
