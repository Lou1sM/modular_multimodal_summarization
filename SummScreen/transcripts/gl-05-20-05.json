You're just saying that to make me feel better.", "Ross: If I am, it's not working.", "Marina: I have to refill those coffees. My grandfather is taking care of the kids, my dad is in prison and coop is...", "Ross: Hey, you don't have to do everything yourself.", "Marina: Are you offering to maybe take some tables? Or to do something about what's going on at the prison?", "Ross: No, what am I'm offering is a friend to listen to the radio with you or to talk about something else. Anything else.", "Marina: You'd do that for me?", "Ross: Yeah, I guess I would, but I'm not talking about me. I'm talking about...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Mallet: Listen to me. I'm going to do whatever it takes to keep cooper safe, okay? And keep her where she belongs. Yeah, I know it's not my decision, but guess what, bob? I'm making it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: Harley, I'll clear you. I'm going to find olivia and prove that she shot phillip. I won't let you down. I'm going to bring you home. I know that you can feel that. I'm going to bring you home.", "Olivia: I'm going to keep you safe. I promise. ( Baby babbling ) yeah!", "Gus: You need to face the facts, pal. Your wife shot phillip. Why else would she run away?", "Alan: Gus. Gus. We're almost there.", "Gus: Yeah. Right. When we get to this house, we're going to play this my way, you understand?", "Alan: All right. I'm just glad you trusted us enough to include us.", "Gus: Yeah, right. Whatever.", "Alan: Well, the only things that really matters is that we're all together.", "Gus: The only thing that matters is getting the truth out of olivia and getting harley out of that hell hole. ( Knocking ) hello, we don't need a scenic tour of oklahoma, okay. Can we go, please?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Mallet: You shouldn't really be standing in the window.", "Harley: Well, frank said he was going to buy us as much time as he could. I'm sure that's running out by now. I'm going to hell house. Come on. That is the only bottom line that prison authority is going to go for.", "Mallet: I'm not going to let that happen. I won't let you go.", "Harley: You mean you won't let me go to that other place.", "Mallet: I mean I won't let you go.", "Harley: I'm not doing this with you right now.", "Mallet: You got something better to do.", "Harley: I don't know. Stay alive, maybe?", "Mallet: Well, hey if we're going to go down, shouldn't we at least be honest with each other. Harley, you found my letters. You know how I feel.", "Harley: That was years ago.", "Mallet: There's never been anyone else.", "Harley: You think they turned off the A.C. Because it's getting really...", "Mallet: Not like you.", "Harley: ... Warm in here. Well, I have to tell you something, mallet. I've actually had several else'S.", "Mallet: Yeah, and?", "Harley: What? What the hell are you asking me? If I've gotten over you? If I still love you? I can answer that. Yes. Okay. Yes, I do. And no, I don'T.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: Hey.", "Marina: Hey.", "Danny: Any word on harley?", "Marina: She's still inside. And the cops are still on the outside.", "Danny: Okay, marina...", "Marina: What more is there?", "Danny: Considering what's going on, why don't you think about closing up early.", "Marina: No, I'm keeping the restaurant open. Everyone in this family has a job to do.", "Danny: I know. But the world won't come to an end if...", "Marina: You know what? I'm fine. This is my responsibility and I'm handling it.", "Danny: Okay. Can I help?", "Ross: A valiant effort. I gave it a try myself.", "Danny: I don't know why she bothers with this place tonight. I mean it's not even the coopers restaurant anymore.", "Ross: I think it's the stay very busy syndrome. Brought on by a feeling of helplessness.", "Danny: I know the feeling.", "Marina: Hi, dad, it's me. No, I was just calling to see if... yeah. That's what I thought. No. No, I'm going to call them in just a minute and see if everything's okay with the boys. Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. All right. Okay. I love you, too.", "Danny: Are you scared? Do you need someone?", "Marina: I do. I need you, danny. I need you to hold me and make everything okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Mallet: So that's your answer, yes and no?", "Harley: That's it. Take it or leave it.", "Mallet: What are you afraid of?", "Harley: Why are you doing this now? With everything that's going on outside those walls, you want to revisit our lives?", "Mallet: I just want to know where we stand.", "Harley: Okay. Okay, this is where we stand. You were the first man that i ever loved. I mean really loved from way down deep inside me. Nothing held back.", "Mallet: We were good together.", "Harley: But when you love that deeply and it's just over, you're never the same. There's a part of that you don't get back.", "Mallet: Yeah, that's a good way of putting it.", "Harley: The girl who loved you then is still in here, yes. But the woman I am now, I'm in love with someone else. Gus.", "Mallet: That's pretty convincing. But see when I look into your eyes, I see the woman that i fell for and the one who fell back. I mean she's right here. ( Tap at the door ) relax. If that was tac unit, they wouldn't knock.", "Harley: Well, who is it then?", "Mallet: I asked one of my men to have your cell-mate bring some food.", "Harley: Lena?", "Mallet: I thought it'd do you some good to see a friend. Hey.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lena: Hi.", "Mallet: I'm going to check and see if there's any word from the governor.", "Lena: Hey. What did I just walk in on here?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: The last thing I need right now.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: All right, this is it. This is as close to the house that I want to get, okay. You just stay put.", "Alan: Wait a minute. I didn't fly all the way from springfield to sit here...", "Gus: I'm going to handle olivia by myself, okay. You two, just stay put. Please.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alexandra: If olivia is in there, then emma's obviously there. We do not want to traumatize that child.", "Alan: That's a good point. All right, go ahead, son. But you know that we're here to back you up if you need us. Good luck.", "Alexandra: Well, bravo. Brilliant.", "Alan: What are you talking about?", "Alexandra: How long are you going to keep this up, alan? Until harley's dead?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: So you can play in the play area for a little bit, but keep your jacket zipped up, okay? Go ahead.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: All right, olivia. No more running for you.", "Bill: What are you doing here?", "Gus: I'm saving the woman i love by burying the woman that you love.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lena: Life with the ex isn't all it's cracked up to be? Hmm?", "Harley: It's torture.", "Lena: My ex is dead. So I guess it wouldn't be so bad.", "Harley: I wish I could just hate him the way I have for the past eight years. That was easy.", "Lena: \"I want the truth.\"", "Harley: \"You can't handle the truth.\" ( Both laughs )", "Lena: \"A few good men.\" 1992.", "Harley: 1992.", "Lena: Right. I thought I'd really stump you with that one.", "Harley: I was a cop. I'm pretty quick with things, you know.", "Lena: So the warden, you're starting to...", "Harley: Lena.", "Lena: What?", "Harley: I love gus.", "Lena: Ah-huh.", "Harley: I love gus. That's all.", "Lena: I didn't hear a period at the end of that sentence. What I heard was I love gus, comma but...", "Harley: Is mallet paying you off?", "Lena: A guy risked his life and limb-- not to mention his job-- for you. I think he's probably expecting at least a comma, but. What?", "Harley: This is crazy? Listen to me. There are sharp shooters outside those gates. I'm in the middle of a police standoff here! And you're forcing me to admit I'm still in love with my ex- husband!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marina: I want you to take me home, danny.", "Danny: Yeah, what about distance? What about you not believing that I want to be with you and only you.", "Marina: Did I say that?", "Danny: Yes, you did. Many times. You think I still love michelle.", "Marina: Well, do you?", "Danny: No. How could I want to be with anyone other than you.", "Marina: Take me home.", "Danny: I will. I'll take care of you. Take away all your worries and doubts.", "Ross: Danny, have you heard from michelle?", "Danny: She's doing okay. She's really happy to be with her dad.", "Ross: Yes, and vice versa. How are you doing? Are you holding up okay?", "Danny: Yeah. I'm fine. You must be relieved that michelle's away from anything santos.", "Ross: Danny, all I've ever wanted was for michelle to be safe. And I want the same thing for marina, too.", "Danny: Yeah, so do I.", "Marina: I'm tired of this. I'm tired of waiting, making you prove yourself. I don't care about michelle. I don't care about the past. We're good. No. No, screw that. We're great. And it's good enough for me. So say good bye to distance and just hold me as close as you can.", "Danny: Well, you sure?", "Marina: You tell me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lena: You're the one who told me that the warden was the great love of your life. Now there's always unfinished business when that happens. I mean it could be worse. He could hate your guts. He doesn'T. He's on your side. And in love.", "Harley: Forget love. Okay, stop thinking about that.", "Harley: I am a convicted murderer under the protection of some rogue warden.", "Lena: Mm, if that were a movie...", "Harley: It's not. Okay. I mean, what does he expect me to do anyway? Just jump back into a life with him? Even if we weren't in here. Forget about that part. It's all crazy. I'm a different person now.", "Lena: He's probably a different person, too.", "Harley: Has he been remarried? Divorced? Had children? Did his mother die? I don't think so. Mine did. And that changes you.", "Lena: Oh, honey. Come on.", "Harley: I want my mother now. God, I miss her. I've been thinking about her so much lately. Yeah, granted the woman made mistakes, okay. But she had a way of seeing things that was just so clear, you know. She was like you. She liked all those movies and stuff. So being with you it makes me feel like she's here.", "Lena: If you were my daughter, I'd say you have a good heart, a true heart. Trust it and do what it tells you to do.", "Harley: Trust it?", "Lena: Yes. Faith is what's behind everything. If you were my little girl, i would say, after I hugged you very tight, that everything is going to be just fine.", "Harley: If I was your little girl, I would say I believe you.", "Lena: Oh, honey.", "Harley: Lena, thank you for every...", "Lena: No! No. No, no, don't thank me. Don'T. Okay? Don'T.", "Mallet: Thanks, lena.", "Lena: Yeah. Excuse me.", "Harley: What's going on?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Mallet: I just got word my buddies heading in right now to meet the governor. This is big. This is huge. This could solve everything. You might be able to stay here, with me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: Emma? Yeah, no. Keep your jacket zipped up. Okay. Oh, I shouldn't have come here. There's too many memories. They're not even my own.", "Bill: Go home, gus. Please.", "Gus: I don't think so. Is she in there?", "Bill: I don't know.", "Gus: Is she in there?", "Bill: I don't know.", "Gus: Well, there's only one way to find out.", "Bill: Listen, listen. If you go in there, she's not going to talk to you, all right? She will tell me the truth so just let me go in there alone.", "Gus: I don't think so. I'm not...", "Bill: Gus, ten minutes. If it was harley, you would ask me the same thing. Ten minutes.", "Gus: You've got five.", "Bill: Olivia? Is that...", "Olivia: Hey! What are you...?", "Bill: Well, hello, sweetheart. Is that any way to greet your hubby?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alexandra: Alan, don't you think that I can see through you.", "Alan: I have no idea what you're talking about.", "Alexandra: He's your son, for heaven's sakes. You think by destroying the woman he loves that that's going to bring back your other son? Alan, it's only going to push him farther away.", "Alan: You know what? I think I should make a note of that.", "Alexandra: Really. I know how your mind works, my dear. You know something? Even if olivia is proven to be phillip's murderer, you're still going to go after harley, aren't you?", "Alan: You bet I am.", "Alexandra: Phillip's dead, alan. Lizzie's running around terrified she's going to turn into her father or you-- yes, you. Enough is enough.", "Alan: It will be enough when I say it's enough, alexandra, and you would be wise to remember that.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Mallet: Once my friend gets in there and convinces the governor to call me, we're golden.", "Harley: I don't know.", "Mallet: No, I can make the governor see that ther'es no way you belong in hell house, that it was a lousy idea from the start. Well, come on, harley, have a little faith. No matter what you feel for me or don't want to feel, I need you to believe in me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: I'm doing what needs to be done for the family. ( Telephone rings )", "Lena: Alan?", "Alan: Where's harley? Is she still in mallet's office?", "Lena: The deal is off. I'm not going to hurt her anymore. I won'T.", "Alan: Well, if you want your daughter in your life, you will honor our agreement.", "Lena: I'm not sure that i deserve my daughter in my life. I want... I want to be someone that she can respect.", "Alan: Do I have to remind you, lena, that I have connections in prison that could make your life a living hell?", "Lena: Oh, honey, my life is hell. Good-bye, alan. It was really nice working for you. Coming up on \"guiding light.\"", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: What if I told you that I did it? That I shot phillip?", "Bill: Well...", "Olivia: Would you leave with emma and me?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: You pretended to be my friend. And all this time you've been feeding information to a man who is hell-bent on destroying my life, lena.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lena: I do care about you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marina: And don't forget to fold jude's blanket into thirds. That's how harley did it and she'd kill you if... I know you know. I was just trying to help. I was trying to help.", "Ross: Marina, you know that guy at table five? He was screaming for his dessert, so I ran into the kitchen, I grabbed it and I gave it to him.", "Marina: You didn't have to do that.", "Ross: Yeah, I think I did, because I was about to call my security people to take care of him.", "Marina: Thank you.", "Ross: Yeah.", "Marina: You know, I think this is the only restaurant in town with the mayor as a waiter.", "Ross: ( Laughs )", "Marina: Don't expect to fork over my tips, though.", "Ross: I'll just skim the normal 10% off the top.", "Marina: Oh, all right.", "Ross: You know, there's a young man in there who wants to make you feel better and take care of you.", "Marina: I don't doubt that. And I want to let him in, I do. But...", "Ross: But the 800-pound gorilla that everybody's trying to ignore, michelle.", "Marina: That's not a very nice way to talk about your best friend's daughter.", "Ross: ( Laughs ) at least you still have your sense of humor about things.", "Marina: Yeah, well, I have to laugh. You know? I have to make light of it. I have to keep from getting too close.", "Ross: I suppose that's one way to live.", "Marina: Maybe at some other point in my life, you know? Maybe if harley wasn't in danger and things weren't so complicated. I mean, I would love to have a guy like danny to make me feel safe and loved.", "Ross: You know something? I love michelle like a daughter, but I couldn't say for sure that danny would pick her.", "Marina: It really doesn't matter. I just can't do it. Not now. Why can't things be like they were before, you know? Why can't harley be safe and zach and jude have their mom back? I just need to be alone. It's okay, really. I'm fine alone.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: I want to.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: You were talking to alan spaulding? Don't deny it, lena.", "Lena: I won'T. I won'T. I'm sick of lying to you.", "Harley: Working for him? Spying for him?", "Lena: I'm so sorry.", "Harley: You pretended to be my friend. And all this time, you've been feeding information to a man who is hell-bent on destroying my life, lena.", "Lena: I do care about you.", "Harley: Yeah, as a payday.", "Lena: No. No, no. I did not do this for money.", "Harley: Then what?", "Lena: My daughter. I... I want to see my daughter. I can't get her to come and visit me here, and alan said he could get her to come.", "Harley: Mm-hmm. If you'd keep tabs on me and report back to him. How convenient for everyone. Except me, of course. It was you, wasn't it? You ratted me out when mallet was trying to hide me.", "Lena: That's why I can't do this anymore. I made a terrible mistake, harley.", "Harley: And you're so sorry, aren't you?", "Lena: Yes. Yes, I'M... I'm sick about it.", "Harley: Well, that's very comforting, lena. Thank you.", "Lena: Listen, you can believe me or you don't have to. But I would give anything right now if I could just make myself go back in time and not make that phone call.", "Harley: No wonder your daughter wants no part of you. What are you waiting for, lena? Get out of here!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: Oh, so you're not going to pick up this time. Listen to me, lena. You will do as I say or your next stop will be the same as harley cooper'S. And you know I can do it.", "Alexandra: What was that all about?", "Alan: Nothing.", "Alexandra: You only mentioned the same prison that harley's being trans... you're behind the transfer, aren't you? You know, alan, if harley goes to that prison, her whole life could be destroyed. For heaven's sakes, good lord, she could be killed! Oh, god. That'S... that's what you're planning, aren't you?", "Alan: I arranged the transfer, alexandra. I'm not responsible for the security or lack of in prisons.", "Alexandra: And after harley's destroyed, what? You... I know what. You could find some way to exonerate her of phillip's murder. Maybe then you could go after olivia.", "Alan: Hm. How inspired. You know, great minds think alike. Where are you going?", "Alexandra: To get some air. It's a little stuffy in here. All this genius brain-power sucking out all the oxygen.", "Alan: You listen to me: Don't go too far.", "Alexandra: Me wander away from the flock, alan? Don't give it a thought. Oh, get me out of here.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: So, what happens now? You have me cuffed and dragged back to town?", "Bill: Olivia, is that what you think? Is what why you left the spaulding cottage before I got there? You just don't trust me.", "Olivia: You know what? I shouldn't have told you where I was to begin with. It was a moment of weakness.", "Bill: I don't think it was a moment of weakness. I think you did it out of love, that's what.", "Olivia: Is that why you're here? Because of love?", "Bill: That's exactly why I'm here. But olivia, you've got to answer some questions for me.", "Olivia: Here we go. Here we go.", "Bill: No, listen to me. Listen to me. Will you listen? Listen to me. Why did you lock gus in that room? Why would you leave town? Help me understand this.", "Olivia: You would never understand!", "Bill: Why wouldn't i understand?", "Olivia: Because you're bill lewis.", "Bill: Oh, here we go.", "Olivia: You're somewhere between an eagle scout and an angel. You have no idea what it's like when people assume that every word out of your mouth is a lie or manipulation or both. All right? I could run into a burning room and scream \"fire\" and no one would believe me.", "Bill: Well, you know what? I'd believe you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alexandra: Gus. I'm sorry, but there's something I really want you to know about your father.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Mallet: Damn it.", "Harley: What? What now?", "Mallet: The governor canceled the meeting with my buddy. He was called away at the last minute.", "Harley: I think I can tell you why.", "Mallet: What?", "Harley: Turns out that my friend-- my dear, dear friend-- lena? She was in alan spaulding's pocket, probably since the day i got here. She's the one that ratted us out when you were trying to hide me.", "Mallet: What?", "Harley: We didn't stand a chance with her.", "Mallet: Well, you know what? In about five minutes, she's going to be in solitary.", "Harley: No. No, no, no, no, no. Don't, don'T. Don't bother. Come on, the damage is already done. What does it matter? And at least we know alan was the one pulling the strings behind that transfer. He's probably the one who gave the idea to the prison authority to begin with.", "Mallet: I bet you he's the one that got to the governor.", "Harley: ( Laughs bitterly )", "Mallet: Okay, that's all right. We've still got some options.", "Harley: Oh, this I've got to hear.", "Mallet: What? There are a few other people i can call.", "Harley: And I should have faith, right? Because it's from faith that all good things come. I'm so stupid! I don't know why I trusted her.", "Mallet: You were locked up. You were scared.", "Harley: No. People always let you down. Always. I should have learned that by now, right?", "Mallet: Well, what are you going to do? Give up? Not trust anyone anymore?", "Harley: I don't know. I don't know, okay? I'm just... I'm tired. Can I just be a little tired?", "Mallet: Yeah. I know. And lena, phillip, gus, me, we all let you down.", "Harley: You did.", "Mallet: I'm not going to let that happen again. I'm going to get you out of this mess, harley.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Swat team leader: ( On bullhorn ): Harley cooper. The building is sealed off. Last chance. Give yourself up now!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: You're a mess, you know that?", "Marina: Is that supposed to charm me?", "Danny: Just a reality check. A shot in the arm.", "Marina: Well, you really are very charming.", "Danny: Have you noticed that the more you need me, the more you pull away?", "Marina: Is that so?", "Danny: Look at you. You're completely overwhelmed by everything, what's happening with harley, and you can barely let me be next to you.", "Marina: You're sitting next to me now.", "Danny: Because you thought i was ross.", "Marina: I didn't want him next to me, either.", "Danny: Just lean on me. Just for tonight, if that makes you feel better. Until we know more about harley.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: Go ahead, talk fast.", "Alexandra: All right. I hope you know how much your father loves you.", "Gus: This couldn't wait?", "Alexandra: He would do anything in the world for you...", "Gus: Sure, except tell the truth or leave harley alone. Do you want me to go on? Because the list is very, very...", "Alexandra: All right, all right. I agree he can be stubborn, he can be contrary, but I honestly believe it is all out of love.", "Gus: Alex, I don't have time for this, okay? I can't deal with this right now.", "Alexandra: Maybe you're right.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Baby, I am here and i want to help you, but you have to let me.", "Olivia: What if I told you that I did it? That I shot phillip?", "Bill: Well...", "Olivia: Would you leave with emma and me? Would you run away with us?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: You talked to gus, didn't you?", "Alexandra: Oh, yes, I did, i did. But I didn't tell him you were the one behind harley's transfer.", "Alan: Why not?", "Alexandra: Because I love you. And I have this silly notion that maybe I can convince you that you're behaving like a complete ass!", "Alan: I know you think I'm making a mistake, alexandra, but I am doing the right thing and i just wish that you trusted me on this.", "Alexandra: Okay, you are so stubborn. You have always been so stubborn.", "Alan: Yeah, well, my stubbornness is what's kept this family together.", "Alexandra: ( Laughs ) well, you have a very odd concept of what \"together\" is, alan.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Mallet: Please, keep away from the window. Come on. ( Sirens )", "Harley: They're all here for me?", "Mallet: The tactical unit deploys for any incident in a prison. You know that. It's a standard procedure.", "Harley: Quit acting like it's no big deal.", "Mallet: Harley, we're fine.", "Harley: We are not fine!", "Mallet: Listen...", "Harley: And this is where it ends.", "Mallet: No. Come on. I still have some options.", "Harley: Stop. Stop trying to be a hero. Stop trying to make up for something that happened a lifetime ago by saving me now.", "Mallet: That's now what I'm doing here, okay?", "Harley: Look wheve we are! I should have just gotten on that bus when they first came for me, mallet.", "Mallet: Oh, so they can find you in your cell with a shiv in your back?", "Harley: Stop it. Because I'm not listening to you anymore. Now, I'm going out there and I'm turning myself in before I get us both killed.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ross: Blake, it's me. Really? I was just thinking about you. Well, why don't you rustle up a baby-sitter. I'd really like to take you out tonight.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Olivia, are you telling me that you killed phillip?", "Olivia: I asked you if you would run away with us.", "Bill: Stop playing games with me and tell me the truth.", "Olivia: What does your heart say, bill?", "Bill: It says that I love you, olivia...", "Olivia: What else does it say?", "Bill: ...But you have to tell me.", "Olivia: Besides that!", "Bill: Right after phillip got shot, I asked you if you did it and you said you didn't, and i believed you. And when you went down to the airport and tried to leave town, I stopped you. Why? Because I believed you, and i love you, and I wanted you in my life. Do you remember that?", "Olivia: And now?", "Bill: I still want you in my life.", "Olivia: What happened to the belief part, bill?", "Bill: Listen, you have to tell me what is going on. Why would you lock gus in that room? Tell me. Whatever it is, olivia-- whatever it is-- we can handle it.", "Olivia: Because we love each other.", "Bill: Yeah, that's right, because we love each other, and no matter what you say, no matter what you tell me, olivia, nothing will change that. But you've got to tell me the truth.", "Olivia: The truth is I don't want to lose you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: I miss my boy.", "Alexandra: Alan, I know. But you've got to let phillip go. I mean, that's what has to be done. You've got to let your boy rest in peace.", "Alan: I don't know how to do that. ( Knock on window )", "Gus: We're out of here.", "Alan: We're going to springfield? What about olivia?", "Gus: She'll be in springfield soon. Trust me.", "Alexandra: How can we be sure of that?", "Gus: This is how.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Mallet: You're not going out there.", "Harley: It's my life. It's my call.", "Mallet: Harley, think about it. What if spaulding paid off one of the snipers.", "Harley: Mallet, get out of my way!", "Mallet: We have to find a way out of this that guarantees your safety.", "Harley: There isn't one! Have you looked out the window lately? We are out of options.", "Mallet: You're wrong. You're wrong.", "Harley: Then you give me a viable alternative. You give me one positive thing that I can hang on to. You give me one good reason why I shouldn't walk out that door right now and turn myself in. Next, on \"guiding light.\"", "Mallet: You wanted a reason not to turn yourself in. That was one.
