        "Olivia: What happened to you? ",
        "Bill: I ran into a rose bush. ",
        "Olivia: Oh, that's cute. You've obviously \r\nbeen in a fight. ",
        "Bill: Well, you should see other guys. Not a \r\nscratch on them. ",
        "Olivia: Does this have anything to do with \r\nyour blushing bride? ",
        "Bill: Why would you say that? ",
        "Olivia: No reason. It\u2019s just a guess. \n",
        "Bill:\u00a0 A good guess I might add. ",
        "Olivia: Do you want to tell me about it?\r\n",
        "Bill: Not really.\u00a0 I\u2019m just protecting the \r\nwoman I love, that's all. ",
        "Olivia: Yeah. Well, I admire your gallantry, \r\nbut next time, you might want to hire a little muscle. ",
        "Bill: That's Vinnie Salerno style, not mine.\r\n",
        "Olivia: Vinnine Salerno? ",
        "Bill: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Olivia: Is Eden in some kind of trouble?\r\n",
        "Bill: Not anymore. ",
        "Olivia: Are you sure? ",
        "Bill: I took care of it. ",
        "Olivia: I can see that. ",
        "Bill: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Olivia: Wow, you've had a rough 24 hours. \r\nThis, last night. How are you feeling this morning, by the way? ",
        "Bill: You drove me home. ",
        "Olivia: And tucked you in. ",
        "Bill: And tucked me in. Was Eden there?\r\n",

        "Gus: So are you going to tell me the truth, \r\nor do I have to drag it out of you? ",
        "Harley: Why do you think I'm lying? \n",
        "\r\nGus: Well, because I just saw bill, and apparently bill paid a little visit to \r\nSalerno on your behalf and Salerno's goons roughed him up just a little bit.\r\n",
        "Eden: Oh, my God, is he okay? ",
        "Gus: He's fine. ",
        "Eden: I need to get to him. ",
        "Harley: Eden, you can\u2019t. ",
        "Eden: Where is he? ",
        "Gus: Why can't she? ",
        "Eden: I'm going. ",
        "Harley: You can't do this. ",
        "Eden: Harley! ",
        "Gus: No, I need some answers. ",
        "Harley: Eden, no. ",
        "Eden: Don't put yourself in the middle, all \r\nright? Just stop... ",
        "Harley: Why don't you let me make that \r\ndecision? ",
        "Gus: All right, one of you is going to answer \r\nme because no one's going anywhere until I know what's going on! ",

        "Jeffrey: Ah, if it isn't the happy \r\nhoneymooners. ",
        "Josh: Hello. No, no, no. We're just an old \r\nmarried couple. ",
        "Reva: No, I think we still have that glow, \r\nhoney. ",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. It's glowing so much that it's \r\nblinding me. (Laughter) so, if you'll excuse me. ",
        "Reva: What, you have places to go, crimes to \r\nsolve? ",
        "Jeffrey: Just going to grab some dinner. How \r\nabout you two? ",
        "Josh: Pretty much the same thing. We're just \r\nenjoying the quiet before the storm. (Knocking) ",
        "\n\r\n\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671",
        "Michelle: Hey. Tony, is Danny inside? \n",
        "Tony: Michelle, what are you... what are you \r\ndoing here? ",
        "Michelle: Look, I need to see Danny. Are you \r\ngoing to let me inside? ",
        "Tony: No, I'm not going to let you inside.\r\n",
        "Michelle: Well, I'm not going to take no for \r\nan answer. ",
        "Tony: What... what is this, Michelle? Why are \r\nyou carrying a loaded gun? ",
        "Michelle: Don't worry about it. ",
        "Tony: No, I am worried. I am worried, Chelle. \r\nThis is not the kind of life you need to be living. ",
        "Michelle: Well, it's too late for that.\r\n",
        "Tony: No, it's not too late. Michelle, go see \r\nyour friend, your brother. Do something normal. Not this. ",
        "Michelle: What's normal, Tony? ",
        "Tony: Not carrying around a loaded gun, do \r\nyou understand? ",
        "Michelle: Look, I know what I'm doing. \n",
        "\r\nTony: You don't know what you're doing, Michelle. Here. You don't pick up a \r\nloaded gun unless you're ready to use it. What's going on? ",
        "Michelle: I am ready to use it, Tony. Now, \r\ngive me back the gun. ",
        "Tony: No. ",
        "Salerno: Blow Eden off the map? ",
        "Danny: Yeah, you wanted to make a statement. \r\nThat makes a statement. ",
        "Salerno: I like the way you think. \n",
        "Danny: Come on, Vinnie, you didn't give me \r\nmuch of a choice. ",
        "Salerno: Oh, we all have choices, Daniel.\r\n",
        "Danny: (Sighs) I know what would have \r\nhappened. ",
        "Salerno: Still, you made a choice, my friend.\r\n",
        "Danny: So, I just want to do it and be done \r\nwith it. ",
        "Salerno: Good. The sooner the better. \r\nBye-bye, Eden. Boom. ",
        "Tony: Forget it. You don't need a gun, all \r\nright? ",
        "Michelle: That's not for you to decide.\r\n",
        "Tony: You don't even know how to use the \r\nthing, Michelle. ",
        "Michelle: I've fired a gun before, Tony.\r\n",
        "Tony: This is not the same, you understand? \r\nIt's not the same. ",
        "Michelle: Look, I realized you're concerned, \r\nand I appreciate it... ",
        "Tony: I am concerned! ",
        "Michelle: ...But carrying the gun was Danny\u2019s \r\nidea. ",
        "Tony: It was Danny\u2019s idea? ",
        "Michelle: Yes, as a precaution. ",
        "Tony: Well, it's a stupid idea, Michelle. You \r\nget yourself killed. ",
        "Michelle: Well, take it up with Danny. I \r\nstill need to see him. ",
        "Tony: He's inside with Vinnie. I was given \r\norders not to interrupt them, all right? No. ",
        "Michelle: Those orders don't apply to me.\r\n",
        "Tony: Go home, Michelle. Go home. Whatever it \r\nis, it can wait. ",
        "Michelle: No, Tony. It can\u2019t. ",
        "Tony: Yeah, it can. I'm not... I'll tell him \r\nyou were here, all right. That's it. ",
        "Michelle: All right, all right. (Sighs) \r\nyou're not going to be happy until I go home? ",
        "Tony: That's right. I'm not going to be. You \r\nasked to be family. Michelle, I'm looking out for you. ",
        "Michelle: All right, then, since I'm going \r\nhome, will you give me back the gun? I promise I will lock it up. ",
        "Tony: You going straight home? ",
        "Michelle: Yes. ",
        "Tony: Straight home? ",
        "Michelle: Yes. And you'll give Danny the \r\nmessage? ",
        "Tony: You're going straight home? ",
        "Michelle: Yes! ",
        "Tony: Yeah, I'll tell him. ",
        "Michelle: You'll tell Danny, okay? \n",
        "Tony: I will tell him. Go home. ",
        "Michelle: All right. ",
        "Salerno: I didn't think you had it in you.\r\n",
        "Danny: Why is that? I'm Miguel and Carmen \r\nSantos' son. ",
        "Salerno: Ah, but the sensitive one. \n",
        "Danny: The smart one. Why get my hands dirty?\r\n",
        "Salerno: That's a good motto, but you're \r\nstarting from the ground up. You've got to prove yourself. ",
        "Danny: That's what I'm doing, Vinnie, isn't \r\nit? ",
        "Salerno: Yeah. And I'm proud of you. \n",
        "Danny: All right, so does that mean I have \r\nthe green light? ",
        "Salerno: And my blessing. Go. Tell Tony to \r\ncome in. ",
        "Danny: Vinnie wants you. ",
        "Tony: Everything okay? ",
        "Danny: Yeah. Why shouldn't it be, Tony?\r\n",
        "Tony: Hey, hey, I was just asking, Danny.\r\n",
        "Danny: Better get in there. ",
        "Tony: I'm going, relax. Danny, Danny, \r\nMichelle was.... ",

        "Jeffrey: You're expecting a storm? Thought we \r\nwere supposed to have a calm evening. ",
        "Reva: No. No, no, no. With us, there's always \r\na storm right around the corner. ",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, that's true. You guys are \r\nnormally pretty worked up about something or other, aren't you? ",
        "Josh: That\u2019s... yes. We're just taking \r\nadvantage of this unusually quiet time and just being together. ",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that's nice. No, really, that \r\nwarms the cockles of my heart. ",
        "Reva: Yeah. I'll bet. Yeah, it's quiet all \r\naround, though. You must feel it. ",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, I do. As a matter of fact, \r\nSpringfield is about as boring as it's ever been. Even before I got here. \n",
        "Josh: Sounds like you've done your job, then.\r\n",
        "\r\nJeffrey: Yeah, well, there are still a couple details I got to work out. So, you \r\nkids have a great evening. (Laughter) ",
        "Reva: And to think he could have been our \r\nson-in-law. ",
        "Josh: Okay, I need a drink now. Let's go.\r\n",

        "Olivia: Was Eden there? ",
        "Bill: Yeah. It's not a trick question. \n",
        "Olivia: Kind of feels like it. ",
        "\r\nBill: No, see, the thing is, she says she was in the bathroom when I got home \r\nlast night, and by the time she got out, I was already asleep. ",
        "Olivia: Well, you were asleep when I left.\r\n",
        "Bill: Did you see her? ",
        "Olivia: No, I didn't see her. ",
        "Bill: She wasn't there then, was she? \n",
        "Olivia: I can't say. ",
        "Bill: Oh, that's right. You don't have to. \r\nSee, I was right. That's it. ",
        "Olivia: You were right about what? \n",
        "Bill: It doesn't matter, because the bad \r\nstuff is behind us and what's important now is the future. So that\u2019s... \n",
        "Olivia: The future? We were talking about the \r\nfuture before you passed out. Our futures. ",
        "Bill: Maybe we should have eloped. That's \r\nwhat we should have done. ",
        "Olivia: I don't know. A wedding is nice the \r\nfirst time. You can certainly afford it. ",
        "Bill: See, Michelle said the same thing about \r\nthe wedding. ",
        "Olivia: That you can afford a wedding? \n",
        "Bill: No, the other thing. ",
        "Olivia: Most women dream about their wedding \r\nday their entire lives. ",
        "Bill: You, too? ",
        "Olivia: Yeah, it just didn't pan out the way \r\nI'd hoped it would. ",
        "Bill: Now is this the one to uncle josh?\r\n",
        "Olivia: I don't want to take this trip down \r\nmemory lane. ",
        "Bill: Yeah, sorry, sorry, sorry. ",
        "Olivia: But there is something I want to talk \r\nto you about. ",
        "Bill: Now, you're second one was a big one, \r\ntoo, wasn't it? ",
        "Olivia: It was Alan\u2019s idea. Listen! If you \r\nwant to talk about hearts and flowers, I am the wrong person to talk to. \n",
        "Bill: Oh, a little jaded now, huh, Olivia?\r\n",
        "\r\nOlivia: Yeah, just a little bit. The last one, I did it in a mental institution \r\nwith a judge and my brother as a witness and, personally, it was my all-time \r\nfavorite. Look, feelings come and go, all right, but the constants in our lives \r\nare kids, our careers, bills to pay. Those are the things we've got to focus on.\r\n",
        "Bill: Bills, bills. Okay, now this \r\nconversation has changed, okay? ",
        "Olivia: Thank you! Yes, look.... ",

        "Reva: What happened to you? ",
        "\r\nBill: No, no, no, no. I'm fine. Actually, Olivia and I were just discussing \r\nweddings, but then, who comes walking in: The experts, so... ",
        "Olivia: Yeah, we figured you might have made \r\nit into the record books. ",
        "\r\nReva: Maybe under the category of \"love conquers all.\" So, what, are you handing \r\nout premarital advice, Olivia? ",
        "Olivia: Oh, no, no. Bill felt that you and \r\njosh would be better suited for that. ",

        "Gus: What was the favor? ",

        "Gus: You delivering drugs? The antimonius?\r\n",
        "Harley: Okay, but listen, she's not the \r\nmissing connection. This was a one-shot deal. Last night, only. ",
        "Eden: Nicky, I had to do it. ",
        "\r\nGus: No, just stop. I love your logic. You had to jump in bed with the mob one \r\nmore night and everything would be okay. ",
        "Eden: You know, there's no logic to it.\r\n",
        "Gus: Why didn't you come to me first? \n",
        "Eden: There was no time. It happened all too \r\nfast. ",
        "Gus: There's no time. That's funny. But you \r\nhad enough time to tell Harley, right? ",
        "Harley: No, no, no, no, no. I stumbled into \r\nthis. I found the drugs by mistake. ",
        "Gus: Okay, so you knew about this first, yet \r\nyou let my sister go face-to-face with Salerno with no backup? ",

Like I \r\nsaid, I was talking to Olivia before, but she's so jaded and cynical, and then, \r\nwho comes walking in, Uncle Josh and Aunt Reva. Now, if two people can help me, \r\nit'd be you two. Now, can you help me? Can you help me here, please? ",
