        "Dr. Grant: Alan, you all right?",
        "Alan: Oh, yes, Charles, thank you. I must have gotten a bug down at St. Gabriel, but nothing a good night sleep won't cure.",
        "Dr. Grant: I heard about Beth's miscarriage. Alan, I'm sorry.",
        "Alan: Well, thank you, but these things happen in life. It's important to move on.",

        "Rick: Hey, so you're awake obviously. How you feeling? I'm sorry. Stupid question.",
        "Beth: I want you to leave.",
        "Rick: Beth, we've been best friends since high school. You know me. You know that no one is more upset about how this happened than I am. I... Ross was more than a friend, he was my family. Like you and Lizzie, you're my family. I did this because I was convinced it was best for Phillip to stay dead. He promised me he was going to stay away. No one was supposed to get hurt, no one. I mean, there has got to be a part of you, a parent that understands why I--",
        "Beth: I do. You did what you had to do, and now I'm going to do what I have to do.",
        "Rick: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Dr. Grant: Hello, Beth. You wanted to see me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: No, daddy, no, I can't go with you. No. No, no, no, let go of me! Let go of me!",
        "Coop: Lizzie, Lizzie, wake up. You okay?",
        "Lizzie: Coop?",
        "Coop: Hey. It's me, Lizzie. You're safe, okay? Don't worry. Can I get you anything?",
        "Lizzie: No, just, um-- no, that's okay. It's... it's morning. Why didn't you go home?",
        "Coop: Um, you fell asleep, so I figured I'd stick around and I'd wait and make sure you were okay a while. And I fell asleep myself. And you just woke me up. I think you were having a nightmare.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I was dreaming about daddy and that night on the dock. He tried to kidnapped me right before he went-- right before he went away. And I feel like I'm still dreaming. I've got to go. I've got to go see my mom.",
        "Coop: No. Whoa, wait a minute. Let me order you some breakfast first.",
        "Lizzie: I'm not hungry.",
        "Coop: Well, you might not be, but I'm sure the baby is.",
        "( Telephone ringing )",
        "Ava: I got it! Company. Hello?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: You ever get the feeling like we've done this before? You know, like deja vu and all of that?",
        "Tammy: We'll get you out. I just need to make a few more phone calls. I tried Reva, but she hasn't called me back yet.",
        "Jonathan: Well, because I screwed up Joshua's fundraiser, Reva's probably trying to forget I'm her son again.",
        "Tammy: It's so unfair; anybody can see that. Listen, stay here, okay?",
        "Jonathan: Stay here? ( Laughs ) You need a new boyfriend.",
        "Tammy: I got the one that I want. You sit and relax. I'll have you out of here before you can say...",
        "Jonathan: Ex-con?",
        "Mel: We've got to stop meeting like this.",
        "Jonathan: I so happy you're here. How soon can you get me out of here?",
        "Mel: Well, let me see if I got the story straight. Tammy said you took some poor girl to a prom because you felt sorry for her. And, naturally, she fell in love with you, showed up at your bar with a fake I.D. and when you wouldn't let her drink, she found a way to get herself tanked anyway?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, yeah. I just didn't know that Ashlee was the D.A.'s daughter. I just felt bad for the kid. I was trying to help her out.",
        "Mel: If you knew what I've been through this week, you would know that my tolerance for liars is non-existent. So let's try this again. You can either tell me the real reason why you took that girl out, or I can walk and leave you here to rot.",
        "Jonathan: You know they say no good deed goes unpunished, and right now I'm sure as hell starting to believe it.",
        "Mel: First of all, you're not the good deed type, second of all-- which I probably should've made first-- is we're dealing with Doris Wolfe, the District Attorney. You messed with her teenage, under-aged daughter and she's out for blood, your blood. Now the only way we're going to win this case is if I know exactly what's going on. What did you want from Ashlee Wolfe?",
        "Ashlee: Lizzie Spaulding again. What is your obsession with her? And don't deny it.",
        "Jonathan: I need something on her.",
        "Ashlee: I have something.",
        "Jonathan: Nothing. I took her to the prom because nobody else would.",
        "Mel: And you cared so much because?",
        "Jonathan: Because the kid was pathetic. She was alone, friendless. And I'll you what, after meeting her mother, I can see why.",
        "Doris: My ears are burning, Mr. Randall. I trust you enjoyed your night.",
        "Jonathan: You know, you are making way too big a deal of all this.",
        "Doris: Oh, you think so? Because I haven't started--",
        "Ashlee: I don't want to do this, Mom.",
        "Doris: Look, I know I can't keep you in there forever. You're going to make bail. You'll hit the streets again. But not for long. I will make sure that this case goes to trial. And when it does, I will push for the maximum sentence, no plea bargains, no deals. I also intend to make sure that every police officer in this town knows your name. You so much as jaywalk, you'll be inside. You run a red light, you'll stay inside. Your days of abusing minors are over.",
        "Ashlee: He didn't abuse me.",
        "Doris: Ashlee is 17 years old. You have damaged her for life.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, lady, what planet are you living on? All I did was--",
        "Mel: Let me handle it. We'll see you in court.",
        "Doris: Yeah, for starters. But I'm not going to start there. You and your entire family will pay for this. No one hurts my daughter and gets away with it. Come on, Ashlee. Ashlee:( Whispers ) Sorry.",
        "Tammy: See that? Even Ashlee is on Jonathan's side. These charges aren't real--",
        "Mel: Okay, you know what, we're going to talk later, okay?",
        "Tammy: My mom's covering bail. Are you crazy?",
        "Jonathan: I'm not putting this on your mom.",
        "Tammy: You want to stay in here another night?",
        "Jonathan: Look, I'll be fine. I have the bar, I have money, I'll make bail.",
        "Tammy: Fine. Ashlee's mom hates you. She's--",
        "Jonathan: I just said we'll be fine! I'm not scared of Doris Wolfe! Ow. Ow.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: They're shorthanded today, which means there is no delivery. Maybe I should just order from some place else.",
        "Lizzie: Let's just skip it. I just want to get to the hospital and see my mom.",
        "Coop: You know what, I know you do. And it is important to see your family, but, Lizzie, you can't let them stress you out. You know that if they do, you know what's going to--",
        "Lizzie: I know, I know. You're worried about the baby.",
        "Coop: No, I'm not just worried about the baby. I'm worried about you, too. You know finding out your dad is alive is huge, all right. You've just got to think about it and--",
        "Lizzie: I know, I know. I might see him again. I might see him again. And if he's back to normal, it would be amazing.",
        "Coop: Yeah. He loves you a lot. I do know that.",
        "Lizzie: He wasn't always scary and angry. When I was a little girl, he was my hero. I practically worshipped him.",
        "Coop: I'm sure he worshipped you, too.",
        "Lizzie: I feel so lucky that you're the father of my baby.",
        "Coop: No, no--",
        "Lizzie: I'm sorry. No, I know, we're not anywhere close to where we used to be. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",
        "Coop: No, it's okay.",
        "Lizzie: It's just everything, it's my mom, it's my dad, and it's these hormones that have got me completely out of whack. I'm sorry.",
        "Coop: No, it's okay.",
        "Lizzie: There is one good thing, though.",
        "Coop: What's that?",
        "Lizzie: They are getting bigger every single day.",
        "Coop: Whoa, that's okay.",
        "Lizzie: No, seriously!",
        "Coop: I'm sure they are. Wow, that's good.",
        "Lizzie: They are. You want to see?",
        "Coop: Lizzie, please, no.",
        "Lizzie: I'm kidding. I'm just kidding!",
        "Coop: I've got to get back to work, okay.",
        "Lizzie: Thanks for staying last night.",
        "Coop: Any time you or the baby need anything, just give me a call, okay?",
        "Lizzie: Looks like we're just going to have to need him a little more often. Isn't that right, baby?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: It's not easy, is it? Pretending not to want someone you actually do want?",
        "Ava: Coop and I are friends and I hope we stay friends.",
        "Buzz: Hmm. I have a friend like that myself, you know. Listen, I'd give anything to see Coop happy with someone like you, but I would like to advise you to stay here and wait and be patient and see what happens, but I think you deserve a lot more than to be a traffic cop waiting to see if Lizzie shoots herself in the foot. So, you when you want to leave, I won't stand in your way.",
        "Ava: I appreciate you saying that.",
        "Buzz: Good.",
        "Ava: You and your family have been great to me.",
        "Buzz: Then maybe you'll answer a question.",
        "Ava: Anything?",
        "Buzz: What are you up to?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Remy: Hey, what time did Rick and Mel say they'd be here?",
        "Leah: Ten minutes ago. Want to take bets on who gets here first?",
        "Remy: So I'll put ten on my sister.",
        "Leah: Oh, great. Dad's never on time. Mom's usually early. Let's make it five.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Grant: Again, Beth, I'm sorry for your loss.",
        "Beth: Thank you, Dr. Grant.",
        "Rick: So what was that all about?",
        "Dr. Grant: We need to talk.",
        "Rick: About what? Is Beth okay? What's going on?",
        "Dr. Grant: She's fine. Look, Rick, I've known you for more years than I can count. You're father and I are good friends. You're a fine doctor; you're a fine person. And I really do regret having to inform you that as of today, you will no longer be practicing medicine here at Cedars.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Would you tell me who I need contact about making arrangements for the baby's funeral?",
        "Nurse: I'll check on it, Mr. Spaulding. I'm sorry for your loss.",
        "Alan: Thank you. You know, everyone's been so supportive, kind. Oh, nurse? Um, I didn't have a chance to find out the sex of the baby. A boy. I lost another son.",
        "Dr. Grant: Beth was not indicative. She even said you believed you were acting to protect your family.",
        "Rick: I did, Charles. It may be hard for you to understand, but I did what I had to do.",
        "Dr. Grant: Maybe so. But that doesn't excuse your breach of ethics. You were acting as medical examiner. You falsely identified a body for personal reasons.",
        "Rick: You know what, you took this-- you know what? I can't do this right now, Charles. My daughter just came home from boarding school; my wife and I are having a lot of problems. I want to work. Charles, I need to work. I need this place. I need it. There's got to be something we can do to work this out, please.",
        "Dr. Grant: Rick, I am sorry, I really am. But pending a further investigation, by the review board, you are suspended from further duties indefinitely. You've opened us up to lawsuit, publicity--",
        "Rick: No one is going to-- I don't think anyone's going to publicize it, Charles. Why would they do that?",
        "Dr. Grant: Rick, right now it does not matter what you think. Right now, I want you to clear out your locker, turn in that security badge, and I'd like you out of here by the end of the day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: For mom's baby. Let mine be okay, please. I know that telling people that Coop's the father it isn't exactly right. But in my heart, it's not like I'm lying or anything because I really do want Coop to be the dad. Okay, it's a little lie. But it's the best thing for my baby. Everyone knows that. Even you, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Hey, sorry I'm late.",
        "Leah: Mom's even later.",
        "Rick: Of course.",
        "Leah: Pay up, loser.",
        "Remy: I don't know what they teach this kid in school, but if I were you, I'd enroll her at Springfield High.",
        "Rick: See, I never wanted her to leave in the first place, but no, she had to go to school with Cynthia Morris, who's not her best friend anymore.",
        "Leah: She's so immature.",
        "Rick: Being immature is not such a bad thing. So is sticking around with your parents.",
        "Leah: I have a life. I can't just leave it cause you're getting old.",
        "Remy: Ooh.",
        "Rick: Ooh, I was counting on you to change my bed pans, but if you've got a life, later. ( Laughter )",
        "Leah: Dad, can we go somewhere to eat?",
        "Rick: Sure.",
        "Leah: Anywhere. I'm like totally starving.",
        "Remy: Yeah, she's fading away.",
        "Leah: Shut up.",
        "Rick: Fine.",
        "Mel: Hey. Hey, is that any way to talk to your Uncle Remy?",
        "Leah: Mom.",
        "Mel: Hi, honey.",
        "Leah: I thought you never get here.",
        "Mel: Oh, I'm sorry. I had had a last minute case.",
        "Remy: Medical or legal?",
        "Mel: I am practicing law today. Come here, let me look at you! Oh, baby. Give me a hug. You are so big. Does that mean I'm getting old?",
        "Leah: No, it means you should have another kid.",
        "Mel: Come here. Listen, tell me everything, okay. I don't want you to hold back. You know how I like to be kept up to speed?",
        "Remy: Now you sound like mom.",
        "Rick: Well, before the interrogation, how about we get something to drink and then we'll decide what we can eat, okay?",
        "Mel: Sure.",
        "Leah: Why don't we get something to eat and drink?",
        "Rick: Why don't you help me with that, honey. Excuse us. You seem a little tense. We haven't finished talking, have we?",
        "Mel: I was done. You can stay in the house as long as Leah's there, but when she goes back to school, we'll make some decisions.",
        "Rick: Honey, this is insane, okay? This is insane. Yes, I made a mistake that blew up in my face, but it's not like I'm running around cheating on you, is it? I love you. You know that.",
        "Mel: I love you, too, but I feel like I don't know you anymore.",
        "Rick: I haven't changed. What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Mel: You're a stranger, and that scares me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Hey, Pop.",
        "Buzz: Hey, Coop.",
        "Coop: What? Okay. All right. Yes, I was out with Lizzie. She found out--",
        "Buzz: I heard. I heard. It's really bad about Beth's baby.",
        "Coop: And Phillip?",
        "Buzz: Not as surprising as it should be. Speaking of surprises...",
        "Coop: Hey. Wow. What's with all of the bags?",
        "Ava: Well, I'm leaving, Coop, I'm moving out today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Okay, um, I know that lying is wrong. But sometimes it's necessary. Like, for instance, if someone asks you, do you like my hair? You're not going to say, \"ooh, you look like inmate number 64.\" You lie to protect their feelings. Just like I'm lying to protect my baby. Can you imagine if this child was raised by Jonathan? There's no way you could want that. I bet even you don't like him. You're on our side. I know that. But if you want, you could show me with a sign, like maybe coop proposing. Please give me a sign. Jonathan.",

        "Ron Raines, \"Inside The Light.\" Ricky Paul is someone I adore and I have to smack around at sometimes. Beth Chamberland is an incredible colleague and I'm thrilled to be working with her. Marcy is a welcomed new addition to \"Guiding Light.\" She really stepped up to the plate and is doing a marvelous job as Elizabeth. There's lots of good memories. I can't name one; I have to name a whole list. See Alan, Wednesday, May 24th, \"Inside The Light.\"",

        "Lizzie: What are-- what are you doing here?",
        "Jonathan: I needed a minor tune-up.",
        "Tammy: He slammed his fist against the bars in jail.",
        "Lizzie: You are in jail again. What this time?",
        "Jonathan: Let's just go, we can talk about this later.",
        "Lizzie: That bad, huh? Did you burn down another house?",
        "Tammy: You're friend Ashlee tried to burn him. She got drunk and tried to blame Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: It's not the kid. It's her mother, the Wolfe woman. Come on, let's just go. My hand's starting to throb.",
        "Lizzie: I hope your hand feels better.",

        "Coop: Ava, look, I am sorry about last night. I wanted to talk to you when you called. It's just that Lizzie had just found out--",
        "Ava: It's fine. Coop, okay it's fine. I understand. I understand completely. You're a great guy. If you weren't a great guy, then I wouldn't feel-- you did the right thing.",
        "Coop: Okay. Look, I was worried about the baby. That's why I stayed with Lizzie. To make sure she could get calmed down, to relax a little bit, maybe try to get some sleep. And... I fell asleep myself.",
        "Ava: I didn't expect you to call me.",
        "Coop: Right. So you're just moving right?",
        "Ava: I'm just moving out of the boarding house. It's not that I'm not going to work here. I'm not walking out on our friendship.",
        "Coop: You sure?",
        "Ava: Of course I'm sure, goofy. I'm still going to be busing tables and stealing your tips when you're not looking.",
        "Coop: What is this? Are you bleaching your hair a different color these days? You've got green stuff--",
        "Ava: It's paint.",

        "Ava: It's paint.",

        "Lizzie: Are you sure? Is it too painful because of the baby?",
        "Beth: No, no, no. Don't be silly. Your baby is my baby, too. If anything, I'm glad that we still have something to look forward to.",
        "Lizzie: You don't have to put an act on for me. How are you, really?",
        "Beth: Okay, darling.",
        "Lizzie: Is there anything I can get you?",
        "Beth: I have everything that I need right here.",
        "Lizzie: Granddad told me about dad.",
        "Beth: He shouldn't have done that, Lizzie. I wanted to be the one to tell you.",
        "Lizzie: No, it's okay. I'm okay, I think. How can he be alive and not want to see us?",
        "Beth: Do you want to see your father, Lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: Not if he's the same way. The way he was right before he was gone. But if he's better, if he's dad again, I miss him so much.",
        "Beth: So do I. And I don't know what to believe. Everyone that lied to us that he is not himself. In fact, he was supposedly so dangerous, they had to deceive us into believing he was dead.",
        "Lizzie: Granddad that said it was for our own gone, to protect us.",
        "Beth: We don't need that kind of protection, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: But you know Uncle Rick. I mean if he thought that--",
        "Beth: We are not china dolls. We don't need big strong men to take care of us.",
        "Lizzie: It's not that bad if it's the right strong man.",
        "Beth: Don't count on it. There's always a price. You count on yourself. We don't need protection from your father. And we don't need protection from your Uncle Rick or your grandfather, for that matter.",
        "Alan: How you feeling?",
        "Beth: I was feeling better until about five seconds ago.",
        "Alan: Beth, please, this is a very confusing time for all of us.",
        "Beth: Confusing? I lost a baby because you lied to me. I don't think there is anything confusing about that.",
        "Alan: This is not the time for recriminations. It's a time to pull together and put the family--",

        "Remy: So, how many boyfriends do got now?",
        "Leah: Like I would ever tell.",
        "Remy: But you could tell dad.",
        "Mel: Can we talk about something important, like her grades.",
        "Remy: I was just trying to catch up with her.",
        "Mel: Look, the last thing she needs right now is a man to break her heart and screw up her life.",
        "Remy: Sis, on behalf of guys everywhere, it is not only the guys who screw things up.",
        "Rick: Amen to that.",
        "Leah: My estimation: You're just about perfect, right, dad? Okay, what is going on with you two? What's the deal with you and mom? When I left for school, you guys were so lovey dovey, it kind of weirded me out. I know something happened, but what? Look, I'm not a little kid anymore. Just tell me and maybe I can help you deal with it.",

        "Mel: Yeah, but don't celebrate yet. Because your father faked an autopsy and helped him escape.",
        "Rick: I was just trying to help everyone.",
        "Mel: Help everyone and Ross, too, who died because Phillip didn't want to be found.",
        "Rick: It was an accident. Ross was like a father to me.",
        "Leah: Dad, what happened?",
        "Rick: Honey, I was doing a favor for my friend.",
        "Mel: For God sakes, why don't you take some responsibility.",
        "Rick: You know what, if I could give my life for Ross being alive, I would do it in a second. And I can explain about Phillip.",
        "Leah: That's okay, Dad. I'm on your side. Dad is the most loyal guy and the planet. He was just trying to help his son.",
        "Mel: Yeah, but that doesn't excuse Phillip and his lies and what happened to Ross.",
        "Leah: It was an accident, Mom. Look at him, he is totally sorry.",
        "Rick: I appreciate you saying that. Thank you.",
        "Leah: So Uncle Phillip is alive? That's wild.",
        "Mel: He is not the same Phillip. You're old enough to understand how he affected us and our family.",
        "Remy: Maybe you need to chill. Phillip being alive is not affecting us. The horrible accident that happened to Ross is affecting us.",
        "Mel: How unlucky that Ross is dead, then, right?",
        "Rick: Excuse me. I need to take a walk.",
        "Leah: Dad, I'll go with you.",
        "Rick: No, that's okay, sweetie. You stay here with your mother.",

        "Coop: All right.",
        "Ava: So are you sure you like it?",
        "Coop: Yeah, oh, my God. I can't believe you did all of that work. You decorated it all by yourself?",
        "Ava: I did. All by myself, and I'm not even near finished yet. But I might need your help with the clouds on the ceiling unless you want to buy a taller ladder.",
        "Coop: So this is why you're moving out. You're making a nursery out of your old room.",
        "Ava: Listen, I know you have a tough fight with the Spaulding's. This way, Alan can't say you weren't prepared. And if he sends his sneaky lawyer snooping around, at least he can't say you don't live next to your ex-- to another woman.",
        "Coop: Come here. Thank you. Thank you. You are just...",
        "Ava: I know. I know I am.",

        "Alan: Our family has been at war for generations, but when external crisis comes into our lives, we pull together --",
        "Beth: External crisis? That's what you call this, external crisis?",
        "Lizzie: You need to go, Granddad.",
        "Alan: Not until your mother realizes that we're unbeatable.",
        "Beth: Of course you're right. Alan. Of course you're right. We lost a baby, but there is still another move. It is just a powerplay to you. Just a game. Our baby would have been nothing but a pawn to you.",
        "Alan: Nothing can be further from the truth.",
        "Lizzie: She doesn't want to talk about it. You have to go.",
        "Beth: Alan, you're upsetting both of us. And in case you've forgotten, Lizzie is still pregnant. And unless you want the same thing to happen to her that happened to me, I suggest that you leave.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, I love you, sweetheart, and I'll be outside waiting for you if you need anything. And Beth, we will talk about Phillip and what to expect for the future a little later.",
        "Lizzie: What can we expect, Mom?",
        "Beth: Everything is going to be okay. You have my word on that.",

        "Mel: The D.A. has nothing. We'll prove she's had it in for you since the fire.",
        "Jonathan: You've got to be kidding me. She shut me down. She shut me down. Closed by order of the District Attorney for selling alcohol to minors.",
        "Tammy: That's not true. It's a lie. She can't do that.",
        "Jonathan: Stupid Ashlee can't tell her mother the truth. It's not just a bar; we actually live here.",
        "Tammy: That's okay. We'll find a hotel until things are straightened out.",
        "Jonathan: We can't. I spend all of my money on bail.",
        "Tammy: There is always Reva.",
        "Jonathan: I don't think so.",

        "Ava: Okay.",
        "Coop: That's going to drive me crazy.",
        "Ava: You think that is going to drive you crazy. Try having a baby?",
        "Coop: Thank you for everything you've done. I wish, um... well, I wish a lot of things. I guess I just hate the fact that you're moving out of the boarding house, but I understand why.",
        "Ava: It's not like I'm moving that far. I'm just going to the Beacon Hotel.",
        "Coop: Okay, wow. What about Olivia, you guys are--",
        "Ava: Yeah, we've had our problems, but at least I know the owner, right?",
        "Coop: Yeah.",
        "Ava: I've got to get moving.",
        "Coop: Ava, wait. Um... thank you. I really wish that...",

        "Tammy: I have some money I saved up for school. We can use that.",
        "Jonathan: No",
        "Tammy: You always talk about you and me, and every time something comes up, you're the one who takes all of the is responsibility for it. Let me do something to help us.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy, you're the best part of us. I made this mess.",
        "Tammy: No, you didn't. You defended a girl. You made her feel like a prom queen for a night. If anything, what you did was selfless and noble. So the girl turns out to be a nut job and her mom is the D.A. Is that your fault?",
        "Jonathan: You know, losing this place, I can handle. But losing you, being separated from you...",
        "Tammy: Hey, you're not going to jail.",
        "Jonathan: I'll do whatever it takes to keep these people from ruining everything for us.",

        "Lizzie: Do you believe that things happen for a reason?",
        "Beth: I used to. But I don't see any good reason for losing a child, do you?",
        "Lizzie: No.",
        "Beth: I'm sorry, honey. Why do you ask?",
        "Lizzie: I went to the chapel, and I lit a candle for your baby, and I prayed for mine. And when I left, something happened that I want to read one way, but what if it isn't? What if it is another way. What if it's a sign that I...",
        "Beth: What can be?",
        "Lizzie: Nothing. We are in control of our lives. God gives us choices, and I am going to make the choice that is the best for my baby. I am going to protect this little boy or girl from dad, from granddad, from... anything else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: So she threw you out, too?",

        "Alan: You've lost a lot this week.",
        "Rick: No more than you. In fact, less than you. This makes me understand why Phillip made all of the decisions he did. So what about you, Alan? What would you do to hold onto your family?",
        "Alan: Anything I have to. I always prided myself for being prepared for anything that life may throw at you. I want you to come with me, Beth. I have a special surprise for you.",
