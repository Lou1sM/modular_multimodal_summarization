{"Episode Summary": [], "Recap": ["Phillip brought Emma to the hospital. Rick reported that she just had a cold. Danny, unaware that Michelle was also in the building, pushed the button blowing up the warehouse with her and Eden inside. He took a picture of a bloody Eden which he then presented later to Salerno. Rescue workers retrieved Eden but missed Michelle, camouflaged by the rubble. Tony poked around the rubble and reported to Salerno that Danny had done what was required. Danny later tried calling her, causing her cell phone to ring under the rubble and alert Tony that there was someone trapped under it all. He found her in bad shape.", "Billy's car broke down at the hospital. Josh and Reva came to give him a lift. All of them end up going over to give Bill the bad news about Eden being at the warehouse. Eden was pronounced dead by the rescue workers but later showed up in Jeffery's car with Harley - very much alive."], "Recap Author": "Silver Eagle Dreamer", "Show Title": "Guiding Light", "Transcript": ["Eden: Danny?

What's wrong?", "Phillip: Her nose was bleeding. I think something's wrong with her.", "Rick: Okay, we'll just... let's just go right inside. I'll take a look. Okay, sweetheart. Listen, just put her in your lap. Kids don't tend to like this part very much.", "Phillip: Babies don't get nosebleeds, right?", "Rick: Take it easy. She'll be fine. Okay, sweetheart. Come here. Uncle Rick's going to take a listen, okay? Is that okay? How you doing, sweetheart? Okay? She sounds a little congested. Has she been coughing?", "Phillip: Some.", "Rick: Okay. Has her nose been running?", "Phillip: Yeah.", "Rick: I see. Okay. I'm going to take a look at your ears, okay? All right. It's just a little thing. Here you go. Okay. Just take a look at this one.

Yes.", "Phillip: A cold?", "Rick: Yeah, a cold.", "Phillip: Well, don't you think you need to run some tests? Why was her nose bleeding if she's just got a cold?", "Rick: It's probably just the dry air. Have this prescription filled and she should be fine in a couple weeks. Did I say a couple weeks? Three days.", "Phillip: Are you sure?", "Rick: Yeah, I'm sure. Tell your daddy he worries too much.", "Phillip: I guess I overreacted.", "Rick: Just a little bit, but you know what? Given Lizzie's history, it's understandable.", "Phillip: That's what it was. I saw the nosebleed and it just made me think about Lizzie and it just scared me. I'll tell you, this is the one part of my life that's still out of whack.", "Rick: Hey, being a parent is a lot of responsibility, pal. Everybody gets freaked out every now and then.", "Phillip: Yeah, but it's more than that, because I can handle the rest of it. The tension with Olivia and being back at Spaulding, that's fine.

I just sent in a team to search for casualties.", "Frank: You did what? On whose authority?", "Jeffrey: On my authority. My guess is that there was a night watchman on duty and so we want to get him out of there before the place blows again, right?", "Frank: You're unbelievable. You sent guys into a building without knowing what they're getting themselves into?

Actually, we're both looking for work. We've got to get it together if we're going to afford college.", "Joey: Yes.", "Cassie: Tammy, I don't want you to worry about paying for college.", "Tammy: Mom, I know there's no secret college fund floating around anywhere. I mean, sure, we have the hotel, but it's not like we're rolling in money or anything. Don't worry. Lots of people work their way through college. So I guess that book's not here.

You mean to tell me you never had a case of cold feet in all of your shotgun weddings?", "Reva: For starters, I never had a shotgun wedding because I knew exactly what I was doing every time.", "Billy: And you're selling bridges today.", "Josh: (Laughs)", "Billy: Huge ones, right?", "Josh: You should have heard the advice she gave bill.", "Billy: Oh, yeah?", "Josh: Mm-hmm.", "Reva: Watch it, mister.", "Josh: Hm.", "Billy: Reva, I really want to hear what you told my boy.", "Josh: Actually, it was to Eden.", "Billy: Oh, to Eden. You didn't tell him to tell Eden to buy herself a red dress?", "Josh: Keeps things spicy. Isn't that what you told him?", "Reva: It does keep things spicy, and you both know it.", "Billy: That's a big \"no comment\" here. (Laughs)", "Josh: No comment from here, either.", "Reva: (Laughs) okay, I've had just about enough from the peanut gallery. Do either one of you have any brilliant ideas when it comes to bill and Eden?", "Josh: Oh, my.", "Billy: Well, you know, actually, as a matter of fact, I do. I thought they should take their honeymoon at cross creek.", "Josh: Well, it's pretty nice up there this time of year.", "Reva: I think for once, Billy, you've got a great idea there. What do you think?", "Josh: (Laughs) I... hey, the smell of daisies in the air and the spirit of H.B. And Miss Martha. I think it's a fabulous idea.", "Billy: Okay, well, I'll bring it up to them.", "Reva: Eden is a lucky gal.", "Billy: Yeah, and I think bill is, too.

Do you think this was an accident?", "Frank: Well, your guess is as good as mine. You know about these old buildings.

I'm her father.", "Rick: And Olivia is the mother, right?", "Phillip: Right. So? Olivia controlled everything for months. I'm just taking back some of that control.", "Rick: Sounds like another war coming on, which makes me ask the rhetorical question: Why are you married to this woman?", "Phillip: As I told you before-- we've been through this-- she's my wife.", "Rick: Yeah, so you say.", "Phillip: Olivia and I have an understanding, Rick.

I do. I just... I don't like that you sometimes work with the Spaulding's.", "Edmund: Oh, please. The Spaulding's are sweethearts compared to most of my former business associates. Besides, there's something else. There's something more than just my meeting with Alexandra. What's wrong, Cassie?", "Cassie: It's just... Tammy. You know, I...
