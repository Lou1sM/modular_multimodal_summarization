        "Reva: Well, you should probably get a mop so this doesn't happen again.",

        "Josh: Make good?",
        "Sebastian: You owe us, Blake and me. Make no doubt about it, I'll be thinking of a way that you can repay the debt.",

        "Bill: Olivia, what are you doing with that? Put the gun down, please.",
        "Olivia: Stay out of this, Bill. Give me my little girl. You don't think I'll kill you to get her back, then you're a stupid man.",

        "Reva: ( Laughs ) A nice guy? Use that defence in court and see how far it gets ya.",
        "Nate: You'd probably get more for your buck by suing me for slipping on spilled beer, and it would be your word against mine anyway.",
        "Reva: I'd win.",
        "Nate: So you're actually going to say that you were harassed while trying to kiss me?",

        "Josh: Alan needs to be taught a lesson. I'm just trying to figure out what it is that you're cooking up.",

        "Gus: Olivia, if you didn't kill my brother, why'd you lock me in that room for over a week? Hmm?",
        "Olivia: I had to protect myself. You were coming after me for no reason. You were so desperate to get Harley out of prison.",
        "Gus: Whoa, no reason? No reason? Keep telling yourself that.",
        "Olivia: Please, tell me where my baby is.",
        "Gus: Do you understand I could have you locked up for so long that by the time you got out Emma wouldn't even know your name. And she'll be here because she is a Spaulding. She is a Spaulding child and I'm a Spaulding so she belongs to me. She belongs to the Spauldings with me.",
        "Olivia: No she doesn't.",
        "Gus: And you want to know why? Because you are a cold-hearted manipulative bitch! That's why.",

        "Olivia: Shut up, Phillip! No, you tortured me! You pushed me. You threatened me. You threatened to take away everything that I love. My entire life. You think that I won't fight back? I always fight back. I will always protect my daughter!",
        "Gus: You're not going to fight anybody because all you do is run. So why don't you run along and find a little hole to bury your head in?",

        "Mallet: One thing at a time. Right now, we've got to get past that gate. Come on.",

        "Mallet: Yeah, it's going to Hellis.",
        "Harley: So, what is she doing on the bus? Is she taking my place?",
        "Mallet: She volunteered to go. I switched the numbers. I think I can pull it off for you.",
        "Harley: She gets nailed instead of me? She doesn't deserve this.",
        "Mallet: You will see people in that prison that you put in that prison. Even if you don't, you are still a cop.",
        "Harley: But Lena will...",
        "Mallet: She will survive.",
        "Harley: No, she will get thrown to the wolves so I can survive.",
        "Mallet: Nothing comes without a price.",
        "Harley: I can't let her go.",
        "Mallet: She sold you out to Alan Spaulding. I know it's awful that someone else has to pay but that's the way it is. She doesn't have little children waiting for her. She doesn't have a life full of promise waiting for her anywhere and she knows that, okay? She wants you to be free.",
        "Harley: No! The only reason that woman is in prison is because she was in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong guy. No matter what she's done, she doesn't deserve this.",
        "Mallet: Let Lena decide what she thinks she deserves. We're running out of time. We have to keep moving. Come on.",

        "Harley: What about you? If you help me out, you will lose everything. Mallet, everything. And if they catch us, you will go to prison.",

        "Mallet: Can we do this later?",
        "Harley: No, we have to do this now. I'm not going to let you keep feeling like you have to pay back something that happened years ago.",
        "Mallet: I still owe you and I still owe myself.",
        "Harley: Listen, I hated you. Hated you for eight years. I never thought I'd get over what you did to me. I never thought I'd trust someone again but you know what? I got over it.",
        "Mallet: With Gus?",
        "Harley: Yes. With Gus I found someone that I could trust again. But, listen, you didn't do anything worse to me than anybody else in my life. And I survived okay? I will always survive. And seeing you now and seeing how much you would sacrifice for me, I know that I can trust you again. I mean, please, I have been free-falling through this nightmare...",
        "Mallet: And I wanted to catch you.",
        "Harley: And you did. And I want to say thank you. Thank you.",

        "Bill: Olivia, come on. Olivia, you are not capable of this. You are not capable of shooting anyone in cold blood.",
        "Olivia: It's the only way I can protect my daughter, Bill. It's the only thing anyone named Spaulding seems to understand.",

        "Bill: Then what, honey? You want to kill him? Where does that leave you? Honey, where does that leave you? In prison for the rest of your life? Then you'll lose your daughter. She'll be away from you for the rest of your life. You don't want that, honey. I'm not going to let that happen. I'm not letting you get away. The only place you are going is home. Going home with me and Emma and that's it. That is it.",

        "Olivia: I can do anything I need to. Oh, my baby! You saved mommy. You saved mommy again, didn't you? I'll never forget what you did to me, Gus, never. You're more evil than Phillip ever was.",
        "Gus: You saw that right?",
        "Bill: I saw you almost get shot, that's what I saw.",
        "Gus: No, what you almost saw was a confession.",

        "Reva: All right. You caught me.",
        "Josh: Ah-ha!",
        "Reva: I owe you an apology.",
        "Josh: And apology and a kiss or was the kiss itself an apology and what are you apologizing for?",
        "Reva: You buying me that television station was a really nice thing to do.",
        "Josh: You already thanked me for that, Reva.",
        "Reva: I don't know. But I didn't tell you how much I appreciated it. I mean really, really appreciated it. And how much I appreciate you.",
        "Josh: I didn't buy that thing because I was trying to score points with you. I bought it because I was trying to help you feel better.",
        "Reva: All I'm saying is that I love you and I wish that it made everything better.",
        "Josh: Reva, I'm just trying to help you get through whatever it is you're trying to get through.",
        "Reva: You know those videos that you put up on the monitors at the T.V. station? That was, like, looking at a different person, you know? I didn't even recognize myself on tape.",
        "Josh: No, that was you for better or worse.",
        "Reva: For better or worse. You know, I remember making that promise once. Twice. Three times. Sold!",
        "Josh: I certainly hope so.",
        "Reva: All I want to say is that I couldn't ask any more of you.",
        "Josh: You've finally run out of ammunition, huh?",
        "Reva: I don't know what more a woman could want in a husband. And I'll never take you for granted, ever.",

For everything that happened with Gus. He would like nothing better than to take Emma away and make her believe she never had a mother.",
