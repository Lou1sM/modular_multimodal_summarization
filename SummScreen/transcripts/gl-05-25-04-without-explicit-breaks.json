        "Tony and Michelle suffered a second blast nearby. Rescue crew finally went back into the building to see if there was anyone else alive. At that time, Tony had recovered enough to carry Michelle to the entrance. Frank tried to take her from Tony but Tony panicked - unable to hear anything Frank was saying.",
        "Eden was told she couldn't tell Bill she was still alive and blew a gasket, begging them to let him in on it. Harley had to deliver the bad news to Bill. Later, Bill found her ring among the ruins. Danny and Salerno toasted to Eden's demise. Danny found out that Michelle was trapped in the blast."

        "Jeffrey: Well, I'm sure Danny also told you that we had to make your death seem real. That we had to sell your death, Eden.",
        "Eden: Yeah, \"selling my death.\" What a concept. The only way to make Salerno think that the hit he put out on you was carried out was to convince frank and the cops and the fireman that you are gone. But I'm really am gone, aren't I?

        "Jeffrey: Irrational is more like it, wouldn't you say?",
        "Eden: We can work this out. We can. Some how we can. Danny, you know, what if it was Michelle who blew up, huh? Wouldn't you want to know she wasn't really dead? Hey, Nicky, what if Harley was the victim? Would you rather someone told you a lie and said that she was dead?",
        "Gus: Honey...",
        "Eden: No! And what if you just got the news that Nicky was gone?",
        "Jeffrey: All right, Eden, listen no one said it was going to be easy or fun, or even fair. You saw what bill did when he saw that Salerno was threatening you. He went and threatened Salerno.",

        "Jeffrey: Listen, Eden. Listen to me. What if we did let you go see bill? What would that accomplish? You might spare him a broken heart. But you might also get him killed. Because what's he going to do? What's hardheaded bill going to do when he finds out the lengths that you had to go to get away from Salerno? He's going to go right back at that guy and he's going to get himself killed. Is that what you want? Salerno had no problem putting a hit on you. He's going to have no problem putting a hit out on bill. It's not safe. And even you can see that.",
        "Eden: How can you even do this? How can you look into bill's eyes and tell him a lie that's going to destroy him? (Crying) how can you do this?",
