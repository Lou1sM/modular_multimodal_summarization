        "Frank: Hey, Bill, I really am sorry.",
        "Bill: Darci, you were a great friend to Eden. She appreciated that more than you'll ever know.",
        "Ross: Gus, I am so sorry. I can't think of a worse situation.",
        "Gus: I don't know what I'll do without her.",
        "Blake: Hey, listen. I'm not going to the beacon, because I'm going to meet roses we're going to go see Michelle.",
        "Harley: Oh, good. Good. But do me a favor. Don't say anything to bill. He doesn't know about Michelle yet.",
        "Blake: What are you talking about? He doesn't know his best friend's in a coma?",
        "Harley: Well, Blake, we thought it was better to tell him after the funeral about the other bad news.",
        "Reva: Bill, we talked to Marah before we came over.",
        "Bill: Yeah, she left some messages. I keep meaning to call her back, but with the time difference, you know...",
        "Josh: She wanted you to know that she's thinking about her favorite cousin.",
        "Reva: If you need anything from us, we're close by.",
        "Reva: Speak of the devil.",
        "Jeffrey: Hand it over.",
        "Eden: What?",
        "Jeffrey: The photograph. Take it out of the wallet and give it to me now.",
        "Eden: But it's just...",
        "Jeffrey: Nothing can remain from your previous life. That was the deal. Let's go. Thank you. This portion of \"Guiding Light\" is sponsored by the new nice 'n easy from Clairol-- color wonderful.",
        "Eden: So my life's trashed, literally.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you're starting a new one, Eden. Whether that's a happy and successful one, well, that depends on you.",
        "Eden: It would be lot easier to accept my new life if I could just say good- bye to bill first.",
        "Jeffrey: We're not going to start on that again, are we?",
        "Eden: So it's started already, my funeral?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. They're probably coming up to him now, as we speak, telling him, you know, how sorry they are.",
        "Eden: To him. Not for me. Deep down they're just thinking, \"good riddance.\"",
        "Alexandra: Well, what do you think Gus and Harley are up to now?",
        "Alan: I don't know, but it looks like they're talking.",
        "Alexandra: Yes. Well, they weren't very gracious yesterday, all but accusing us of having a hand in Eden's death.",
        "Alan: No, Alexandra. They didn't all but accuse us. They all but accused you.",
        "Alexandra: Fine, Alan. But I want you to remember that Gus has sandbagged you before. And besides, he's the reason we're in this mess with the feds to begin with.",
        "Ross: Hello, sweetheart. I told your dad I was going to spend some time with you today, and he thought that was a good idea. But I wasn't sure how much you would like it. You were pretty angry with me the last time we spoke, but that's okay, because I understand. I know how much you love that husband of yours. And in that regard, you are so much like your mother. Just like Maureen, when you love somebody you'll fight anyone or anything that gets in their way. I'm just sorry that you think I was the one to get in Danny's way. I still believe that he has a wonderful future, so long as you're there to share it with him. Michelle, you wake up when you're ready. But you should know that there are a lot of people who would like to see that happen sooner rather than later. We all want to see that smile of yours.",
        "Cassie: People are saying stuff. They think you're back in. You've been seen around town with Vinnie Salerno, and I feel that since the election you've been avoiding me. Actually, you've been avoiding everyone. Then I think since losing the mayor's race, all the accusations, that you've needed some down time and you just really wanted to be alone. So feel free to jump in anytime here, Danny.",
        "Danny: I'd rather not, because then I'd have to lie to you.",
        "Cassie: I see. So do you mind if I ask you another question?",
        "Danny: No.",
        "Cassie: Technically, we're still business partners, so am I in any danger?",
        "Danny: No.",
        "Cassie: Are my children in danger?",
        "Danny: No.",
        "Cassie: How can you be so sure?",
        "Danny: Because I am.",
        "Cassie: Well, pardon if I doubt you, but your wife was just blown up under very suspicious circumstances, and she is upstairs fighting for her life right now, Danny.",
        "Danny: I give you my word, Cassie, as your... I would say friend, but...",
        "Cassie: You are my friend, and you always will be. Because I know deep down that you're a good guy. You'd have to be, or Michelle wouldn't love you so much. If there's any justice, Michelle's going to wake up, and she's going to come back to you.",
        "Danny: Yeah, that's a big \"if.\"",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Well, you know what? The world's full of them. That's why imperfect people like us wind up in places like this-- to hedge our bets.",
        "Danny: I'm a lot more imperfect than you.",
        "Cassie: Well, would you mind telling my teenage daughter that? Because she can't even stand to look at me right now.",
        "Danny: Sure. Anytime.",
        "Cassie: Great. It's a deal. Well, listen. I am going to go upstairs, and I'm going to sit with Michelle, and I'm going to tell her what a great guy you are. And I'm going to tell her how much you and Robbie miss her. And I'm going to give her every reason in the world for her to open her eyes and come back to you, if that's okay with you.",
        "Danny: It's more than okay. Yeah, it's great. Please stay with us for the second half of \"Guiding Light.\"",
        "Danny: Thank you. Actually, Cassie was going to go in and talk to Michelle. Talking helps.",
        "Cassie: Well, then I'm your girl. She's probably going to wake up just to tell me to shut up. So are you going to stick around?",
        "Edmund: Yes, I've got some calls to make, so I'll stay here. Take as much time as you need.",
        "Cassie: Okay.",
        "Edmund: How's... how's your boy taking all this? Does he know?",
        "Danny: No. No. Fortunately, Mel took Robbie to dc before this all happened to visit Michelle's uncle. So he doesn't know.",
        "Edmund: Well, that is fortunate, I suppose.",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Ross: Oh, Danny, hello.",
        "Danny: Hi, Ross.",
        "Ross: You know, Blake is going to be here in a little while. I left Eden's funeral early, so I could... well, I ended up spending a few minutes with Michelle.",
        "Danny: Thank you.",
        "Ross: What is Rick saying about this?",
        "Danny: Until the swelling in her brain goes down, they really just... they won't know anything.",
        "Ross: All right. Oh, I've also been in touch with Ed.",
        "Danny: Yeah, I have, too. And Rick's been talking to him a couple times a day.",
        "Ross: Well, then Michelle's in good hands. Danny, I'm sure that you've heard the rumors that that explosion was not an accident.",
        "Danny: Yeah, I have. I'm assuming that that's what they are, rumors.",
        "Ross: Well, we're going to know very soon once the fire department's investigation is completed. And if foul play was involved, naturally Springfield PD will pursue it.",
        "Danny: Right, naturally.",
        "Ross: And my office is going to see that they do it quickly and thoroughly, and we're going to catch whoever's responsible, whoever it may be.",
        "Danny: Ross, I have no idea what you're suggesting, but this really isn't the time or the place. So if you can't be here just to support Michelle, don't be here at all.",
        "Edmund: Difficult situation for everyone.",
        "Ross: Extremely difficult, yes.",
        "Edmund: Hard to know what to say sometimes. Sometimes I suppose it's best just to say nothing, except maybe support Michelle right now.",
        "Ross: That's what I'm doing, Edmund. Ed Bauer is my oldest and dearest friend, and Michelle is his daughter. Unfortunately, he can't be here to take care of her, so I'm going to do it for him.",
        "Edmund: Somehow I don't think Ed Bauer ever would have spoken to Danny the way you just did.",
        "Ross: Oh, no. No, no. Probably not. You know, Edmund, I am surprised that you don't want me to pursue this aggressively.",
        "Edmund: I never said that.",
        "Ross: Because when your brother died, you were adamant that someone had to pay for his suffering.",
        "Edmund: I thought that someone should represent him.",
        "Ross: That's what I'm doing.",
        "Edmund: As it turns out, I was too emotionally invested. I wasn't able to be objective. I think I did more harm than good, but that can happen to the best of us.",
        "Ross: If you think I'm out to get Danny, you're wrong. Now, I truly hope that that explosion was an accident. But if it wasn't, by definition, it is a crime. And if Danny was involved in that crime, I'm going to do what needs to be done. Michelle deserves that. She deserves justice. And so does Eden August.",
        "Cassie: Michelle, you've been through so much. So many ups and downs and challenges. You had Carmen Santos for a mother-in-law. If you can survive that, you can survive anything. Seriously, Michelle, you... you need to think about Robbie. You need to think about that adorable, sweet face. He needs his mommy. He needs you to help him bake cookies, and he needs you to tuck him in at night. He needs you to prove to him that there's no monster underneath the bed when he wakes up from a bad dream. And Danny needs you, Michelle. He's... he's losing it. He needs your guidance, and he needs your faith, and he needs your love. You're needed here, Michelle. Do you hear me? You've got to come back to us.",
        "Tammy: Can I come back, too?",
        "Cassie: Tammy?",
        "Tammy: Please?",
        "Cassie: Oh, god, Tammy...",
        "Tammy: Mom, I'm so sorry.",
        "Cassie: Shh, honey.",
        "Tammy: No, I am.",
        "Cassie: I'm sorry.",
        "Tammy: I'm getting mascara all over you.",
        "Cassie: I don't care about that.",
        "Tammy: Poor Michelle.",
        "Cassie: I know.",
        "Tammy: When I look at her, oh, I can't believe I got so mad at you and almost ruined everything between us. Over what? It was so petty.",
        "Cassie: Oh, you were upset, baby, you were upset. And you had every right to be. I invaded your privacy.",
        "Tammy: You were just worried about me. Mom, Aunt Reva and uncle josh have been really great, but I miss you and the boys. I want to move back home, okay?",
        "Cassie: Okay, okay! Of course okay! Oh, baby...",
        "Danny: Hey.",
        "Cassie: Hey. We're ganging up on your wife over here.",
        "Danny: Good. If it helps her wake up, do it. Bring R.J. And will, too.",
        "Cassie: You're going to be going home with her soon, you know? You, Robbie, and Michelle.",
        "Danny: Yeah, if there's any justice in the world, right?",
        "Cassie: Look, I know that it's hard being here and watching her, just waiting. So if you need anything, Danny, anything, even if you just want to vent...",
        "Tammy: Same here.",
        "Danny: Okay.",
        "Tammy: You know, vent at me all you want.",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Danny: Thank you. Thanks. Edmund's waiting for you.",
        "Cassie: Okay.",
        "Danny: Go. I'm fine, really.",
        "Cassie: Anything.",
        "Danny: Okay. Thanks. Thanks, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: Being here, seeing Michelle like that, it reminds me so much of Richard.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I know. Hopefully they're going to have a different outcome. We just need to stay positive. Let's go home.",
        "Danny: You're breathing easier, honey. Right? I think. I don't know. Honey, I wish I knew if you were in pain so I could help you. Cassie's right. You're going to come out of this just great. And before you know it, you're going to be out of this bed and coming home with me and Robbie, and everything's going to be fine again. Everything's going to be fine.",
        "Michelle: Oh, right, like I'd really go home with a liar.",
        "Danny: Michelle?",
        "Michelle: We made a pact. We swore to each other, that we would tell the truth from now on. You lied to me.",
        "Danny: Honey...",
        "Michelle: I knew you were up to something, and I asked you. You should have just told me where you were going and what you were doing. Then I wouldn't have to follow you, and then I would be in this bed right now.",
        "Danny: If I told you what I was planning for Eden, then you would have known.",
        "Michelle: Exactly.",
        "Danny: You would have been involved, and O'Neill and I didn't want to put you at risk.",
        "Michelle: I'm not at risk now? I'm not suffering now?",
        "Danny: Honey, honestly...",
        "Michelle: Danny, I'm so sick of your excuses. I will never forgive you for this, Danny. NEVER!",
        "Danny: Michelle, please! Honey, listen to me.",
        "Harley: I still think there's a way that we can tell Bill that Eden's alive without putting anybody's life in jeopardy.",
        "Gus: I think we've had a meeting of the minds here, personally.",
        "Harley: I don't think we have.",
        "Gus: Well, no. I think that that's her version of agreeing.",
        "Harley: No, I think Eden is sad and exhausted and overwhelmed. I don't think that's the same as agreeing.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I agree with Gus. The subject is closed.",
        "Harley: Says the man with the heart of ice. Come on, O'Neill. Hasn't there ever been anybody in your life that you've lost that you would give anything to have just a few more minutes with, to say all the things you didn't get a chance to say? Your mother, your father, a favorite aunt, your girlfriend? Oh, I'm sorry. Did I touch a nerve there? Maybe now you know how Eden feels.",
        "Jeffrey: She's been in there a long time.",
        "Harley: No, she hasn't.",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, she has. (Knocking on door) come on, Eden. Open it up now! Eden, open it! Great.",
        "Gus: Oh, my God."
