        "Lizzie: Aunt alex?",
        "Alexandra: Yes, darling?",
        "Lizzie: I really don't want to do this whole birthday thing?",
        "Alexandra: Well, I'm afraid we're just going to have to make the best of it anyway. You know, alan does miss your father terribly.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, well, so do i and so does everybody else. It still doesn't make it right.",
        "Alexandra: Well, I know. I know, darling. ( Thunder claps ) good lord, that was right over head. ( Laughs ) well, where thunder is lightening sure to follow, huh?",
        "Lizzie: Actually, I think it's the other way around. Lightening travels faster.",
        "Alexandra: What? ( Gasps )",
        "Lizzie: Aunt alex, what's wrong?",
        "Alexandra: I don't know. I thought I saw someone out there. I think my eyes are playing tricks on me. No one would be out in the garden in this kind of a storm.",
        "Lillian: Beth, what are you doing out here, sweetheart?",
        "Beth: I just needed to get some air.",
        "Lillian: Oh. I think you should get some air somewhere other than around these big trees. Maybe better. Come on back inside with me.",
        "Beth: You go on in. I'll be in a minute.",
        "Lillian: You don't want to be in there anymore than I do, do you? I could strangle alan. The idea of having a party for phillip like this. It's so strange.",
        "Beth: The whole night is strange. I just... I don't know. I can't explain it. I have this feeling like something bad is going to happen.",
        "Lillian: Well, honey, that's just because everything's out of kilter. I mean, nothing makes sense to us. Phillip should be here with us celebrating his birthday, not...",
        "Beth: That's just it, you know. He wouldn't be here. He would be off, god knows where, with his children.",
        "Lillian: Speaking of that, have you told alan about what you're going to do with lizzie?",
        "Beth: No. No, I'm waiting till the last minute, so he can't stop us.",
        "Lillian: He's going to be absolutely devastated. He can't let you and lizzie out of his sight as you well know. And that is exactly why we have to get away. No sense putting this off any longer. We should get in and try our best to get through this evening. ( Thunder claps )",
        "Alexandra: Well. Good save. What was it? Bordeaux, merlot?",
        "Olivia: Actually it was a lovely cabernet. And so what, I had a glass of wine?",
        "Alexandra: Just one?",
        "Olivia: You know what? I'm here for an evening with the family. So I thought I would just give myself a little shot of courage. What's wrong with that?",
        "Alexandra: Well, you were suppose to bring emma, you know. Alan is not going to be very happy.",
        "Olivia: My heart bleeds.",
        "Alexandra: Olivia, tonight is going to be difficult enough for all of us without you purposely making alan angry.",
        "Olivia: I think it's so funny that everyone's first concern is will alan be angry. I would worry if I'm going to be angry. What I would do if I'm pushed.",
        "Lizzie: You guys get in here now. Come on.",
        "Tv announcer: The vehicle was a prison van transferring female inmates to the hellis correctional facility. It swerved off route 17, overturned and exploded into flames. There are no survivors. It is believed one of the inmates on board and presumed dead was harley cooper who was recently convicted for the murder of her ex-husband, phillip spaulding. ( Thunder claps )",
        "Buzz: Harley! Harley... what was I thinking? You'd be sitting here reading bedtime stories, giving them snacks, and barking at me and frank to pipe down so that you could calm them down and put them to sleep. I know. I know. Alcohol and heart medicine don't mix. ( Thunder claps ) god. God. ( Sobbing ) my heart is broken. So what the hell? I can't do it yet. I can't call him.",
        "Tv announcer: The victims have been transported to the city morgue and their names will be officially released pending confirmation by the medical examiner's office and next of kin. Stay tuned for details as they develop.",
        "Buzz: I've got to know. ( Thunder rolls )",
        "Gus: News of the accident is all over the car radio. They're thinking that your dead. They're just waiting for the medical examiners office to confirm it.",
        "Harley: Okay, then we don't have much time. You have to get over to the spaulding house and get olivia to crack.",
        "Gus: I know it's hard to believe, but you're going to get your life back, okay?",
        "Harley: I'm starting to believe that.",
        "Gus: Good, good. Something wrong?",
        "Harley: I'm just... was there any news about mallet?",
        "Gus: No... well, he's unharmed. He's in custody but he's unharmed.",
        "Harley: Good. Good. Now listen to me. You need to be careful. I mean really careful. Extra careful.",
        "Gus: Extra.",
        "Harley: Yes. Because if olivia is the killer, she is not going to like being exposed. We know that alan was behind my transfer to hellis. He called in a favor to the governor. And if he is capable of that...",
        "Gus: Yeah, he's capable of that, he's capable of anything.",
        "Harley: Ouch.",
        "Gus: What's wrong?",
        "Gus: Why didn't you tell me you were hurt?",
        "Harley: I didn't even know until now. Gus, I didn'T... I don't want to make a stink. Because I don't want to slow you down, okay. We have to use this little window of time to break olivia. You can't be worrying about me. Please.",
        "Gus: Have you realized that olivia and the spauldings aren't the only ones who are going to think you're dead?",
        "Harley: My family will. I know. That's why you have to get olivia to crack as fast as possible. Please go.",
        "Gus: I can't leave you here like this.",
        "Harley: Well, I can't exactly waltz into an emergency room, can I? So we're back to plan \"A.\" Go, please.",
        "Gus: Okay.",
        "Mel: Yes, this is dr. Bauer. What? Where? No survivors. Wait a minute. What person did you say? Do you have the names? No, not harley.",
        "Buzz: Oh, hi. I'm here about the accident. The one on route 17, the prison van.",
        "Attendant: Sorry, we're not releasing any information to the press.",
        "Buzz: One of the victims might be my daughter. News releases... I'm not a member of the press. I just need to know for sure.",
        "Attendant: I'm sorry, sir. I'll see what information I can get.",
        "Tv announcer: Again, initial reports suggest one of the victims at the accident was convicted killer, harley cooper. As soon as we get confirmation we will of course bring that to you...",
        "Lizzie: What are you doing?",
        "Olivia: We were watching that.",
        "Lizzie: We were watching that. They're saying that harley was killed.",
        "Alan: I know. I heard. But tonight is not about harley. It's about phillip. We're celebrating his life, not dwelling on his death or the person who may have caused it.",
        "Beth: May have?",
        "Olivia: He means me, beth. What? So harley's gone, now I'm your target du jour? Go ahead. Take your best shot, alan. But ladies, I have to warn you once he's done with me, he's going to go after one of you. Lillian, you haven't had a turn yet. It might be you.",
        "Alan: Well, olivia, you're drunk. How fitting.",
        "Olivia: Alan, you are just so on top of it. I like that.",
        "Alan: Excuse us. Are you trying to provoke me, olivia? I asked you to bring emma here tonight and you defied me. But in the spirit of forgiveness...",
        "Olivia: What was that word again?",
        "Alan: You are here. And you will behave yourself. Do you understand that?",
        "Olivia: What if I don't, daddy?",
        "Alan: You will switch to water. I'm going to tell the staff to prepare.",
        "Olivia: Well, it's a party, ladies. So let's eat, drink and be merry. Come on. Let's do a toast, to phillip. Happy birthday and may you rot in the ground. And hey, take your father with you very soon. Drink up.",
        "Buzz: Hey, how long... damn it, don't walk away from me. I have to know if that's my daughter in there? Don't you understand that.",
        "Attendant: The body's burned. It's not a pretty site.",
        "Gus: I have seen burn victims.",
        "Attendant: Just give me a few minutes.",
        "Mel: Harley is alive?",
        "Gus: Yes.",
        "Mel: Thank god. Well, I just got a call from the hospital. They wanted me to relieve rick, so he can get over to the morgue.",
        "Gus: Okay, well, here's what happened. She had a cellmate who was trying to help her out. On the bus transfer, the cellmate got on the bus and she got herself killed.",
        "Mel: Wow.",
        "Gus: But harley was in the accident as well and she's hurt. She needs medical attention.",
        "Mel: Okay, well, I have my bag in the car. But if it's serious, she's going to have to go to the hospital.",
        "Gus: You know what? She can't go to a hospital, because if she goes to the hospital, they have to admit her and they have to tell the authorities and we'll be worse than when we started. I'm just begging you please. I know I'm putting you in a tough spot, but she just needs medical attention. If you could give her the medical attention, we'll take it one step at a time.",
        "Mel: Of course. Of course, I will. Where is she?",
        "Gus: She's at the construction site of her house. If she hears your voice and sees you, she'll come out, okay?",
        "Mel: But... wait a minute. Maybe you should come with me. Because I doubt that she'll come out. Even to me.",
        "Gus: But I can'T. I can'T. I've got to go to the spaulding mansion.",
        "Mel: You're not going to that morbid party that alan's throwing for --",
        "Gus: Yes, I have to. I have a window of opportunity about this big to nab phillip's killer.",
        "Mel: You think the killer's going to be at the party? Who?",
        "Gus: Stay tuned.",
        "Buzz: Okay, lift the sheet. It's my daughter. Oh, god. She's alive. She's alive.",
        "Frank: Dad?",
        "Mel: ( Whispering ) harley? Harley, it's mel.",
        "Harley: Over here.",
        "Mel: Oh, my, harley. How are you? Oh. Show me where it hurts, okay. Let me see. Okay. It's deep, but I think I can stop the bleeding. When didt happen?",
        "Harley: I don't know. When the bus overturned.",
        "Mel: Did you lose consciousness?",
        "Harley: Yeah, but just for a little while.",
        "Mel: So you saw gus. He found you.",
        "Harley: At company. Ow. So he was on his way to the spauldings?",
        "Mel: Yes. That horrible gathering that alan spaulding has for phillip's birthday. Thank god, rick had to work. Do you have any pain in your head or your neck?",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Mel: Okay. All right, I'm going to clean this wound and then I'm going to stitch it up. Plus, I'm going to give you a broad spectrum antibiotic. Hopefully, that's all you need. If you get a fever or if you're dizzy or nauseous or develop any other signs of an infection, you have to promise me you're going to go to the hospital, okay.",
        "Harley: Okay.",
        "Mel: Promise me.",
        "Harley: Mel, you know why gus was on his way to the spaulding's, right?",
        "Mel: He's trying to find the real killer.",
        "Harley: And it could be dangerous. He needs backup. There's no way that maybe rick could go over there...",
        "Man's voice: Hey, who's in here?",
        "All: The itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout down came the rain and washed the spider out out came the sun and dried up all the rain and itsy bitsy spider went up the spout again. ( Applause )",
        "Alan: Good. Boy, that was fun. Now let's see what is next on the agenda? Maybe we should have some cake or open some presents or maybe both. What do you say?",
        "James: Both!",
        "Alan: Great, great.",
        "James: We should have one turn.",
        "Alan: All right, we'll do that. But first, I want... I want to say something to you all. And elizabeth as well. Something very important. So come around here, sweetheart. I want... I want to tell you something about your father, about your dad. Because I believe he right now is sitting up in heaven looking down at you. All of you. And he's feeling very proud right now. James, you know, your father was a very gifted writer. He wrote novels and poems. And you are a wonderful writer, too, just like your dad. Zach, your father was a born leader. And I have watched you in the playground at school and when you have play dates over here, how the kids all look up to you and follow you. And why is that? Because you're a born leader just like your father was. And, elizabeth, I don't have to tell you, sweetheart, how much like your father you are. You already know that. I will only say this: Don't ever resist it. Embrace it. Because your father loved you till his dying day. I can only hope that you will love him to yours. Well, why don't we have some cake, aunt alex?",
        "Alexandra: Yes, yes. Well, I will go speak to the cook about that. You stay here and enjoy your grandchildren. Gus.",
        "Gus: What's up?",
        "Alexandra: You heard about harley. I'm so sorry. Tragic. She's dea...",
        "Gus: What?",
        "Alexandra: Well, unless of course she isn'T. Well, I mean it could be a mistake, right? I mean the prison made a mistake. Maybe harley was never on that bus to begin with.",
        "Gus: Maybe.",
        "Alexandra: Yes. What are you doing here?",
        "Gus: Where else should I be?",
        "Alexandra: Well, I don't know. I thought maybe you might be with the coopers. The people who loved her every bit as much as you did. Instead of coming to the house of the man who sent her this fate.",
        "Gus: That man is my father. I can't seem to get around that.",
        "Alexandra: Well, don't expect to get any sympathy from him tonight. Let me tell you, he's in there right now celebrating phillip's life. Not harley's death.",
        "Gus: Is olivia in there? Lillian or beth?",
        "Alexandra: What? And the children. And what? Look at you. You're rumpled. You're muddy. How did you get so muddy?",
        "Gus: Excuse me.",
        "Alexandra: No, no. Why are you here? No, stop. What is that? No, what is that?",
        "Gus: I was out in the rain. It was messy out, all right.",
        "Alexandra: No, no, that's blood. Where have you been? That is blood.",
        "Gus: It is not blood. Please listen.",
        "Alexandra: Does that hurt?",
        "Gus: Do you have to ask me a million questions? Just let me get in there and do what I have to do, all right.",
        "Alexandra: What? Which is what? Hmm? You're acting very, very odd. Let me tell you that. Because I should think the only thing you'd be thinking about right now is harley. And you could stand here as if... well, not really anything happened. I'm not... she's not dead is she? She's alive. Was this a whole plan? A plan to escape? You helped harley escape. And she's alive?",
        "Lillian: \"My daddy is an angel,\" by zach spaulding. This is a wonderful book, honey. \"My daddy died and now he's an angel. I can't see him anymore, but he sees me. Angels are everywhere. They see everything. They touch us in our dark moments to help us find our way back to the light. They use their wings to wipe away our tears. We feel their light touch on our arm as they travel with us, so we don't feel quite so alone. But most of all, they know what's right and wrong in the world and they know how to fix it.\" Coming up on \"guiding light.\"",
        "Buzz: We're the difference between her being caught and getting away. So don't you say a word. You keep your mouth shut, do you hear me?",
        "Frank: I don't have a choice.",
        "Olivia: Well, that's it, then. The last of our little secret. Happy birthday and may you rot in hell.",
        "Olivia: Gus, what are you doing here? Haven't you heard...",
        "Alexandra: Yes, he's heard. He's devastated. Absolutely devastated. And... oh, I'm so sorry. We all loved her, gus. I'm so very sorry, it's just... oh. Now I'M... oh, dear, I'm so...",
        "Gus: It's okay. I'm sorry, I stepped on your toe.",
        "Alexandra: No, it's all right. Please. Please. I mean... we all loved her. I know how much you loved her. And buzz, buzz must be going absolutely out of his mind.",
        "Gus: Yeah, I...",
        "Alexandra: You haven't seen him?",
        "Gus: No, I...",
        "Alexandra: Well, let me tell you, you must go see him. You must go see him soon.",
        "Gus: I just haven't been able to wrap my head around it, so...",
        "Olivia: Well, I don't think you want to go in there. Pretty scary.",
        "Gus: I'm surprised you're here.",
        "Olivia: Well, you know when alan snaps his fingers...",
        "Gus: I thought you hated phillip.",
        "Olivia: I loved him once, too. I have a daughter to prove it.",
        "Gus: Oh, yeah. The same kid he kidnapped, right?",
        "Olivia: Oh, here we go. ( Laughs )",
        "Alan: Alexandra, where is... oh, gus. Glad you decided to come.",
        "Gus: Alan, I don't need your phony sympathy, okay? I'm here for everybody else's sake but yours.",
        "Alan: Ladies, would you excuse us for a minute?",
        "Olivia: Sure.",
        "Alexandra: Sure.",
        "Alan: Gus, gus, look. I am truly sorry. I know how much you loved her. But I'm glad that you're here with your family now. Why don't we go in and...",
        "Gus: I can't, okay?",
        "Alan: Well, you're going to make zach very disappointed.",
        "Gus: You didn'T... don't tell me you told him about...",
        "Alan: No, no. I'm not going to tell him. I think the coopers should do that tomorrow. Tonight is about his father's birthday.",
        "Gus: The girl I am in love with just died.",
        "Alan: And her baby boy, who has already lost his father and now his mother, is in there and he needs you, gus. Please. ( Thunder crashes ) zach, look who's here.",
        "Zach: Gus! ( Laughter )",
        "Gus: What's up, champ? Who's too high? Who's too low?",
        "Alan: And you know what? His timing couldn't have been perfect, because it's time to open some presents.",
        "Alexandra: Cake's on the way.",
        "Alan: Yes. And everybody gets a present tonight, even the grownups, so let's start with some of the grownups here. We've got olivia. Gus, here is your present. And lillian, here's yours.",
        "Lillian: Thank you.",
        "Alan: Beth, right here. Now, come on, guys, come on. Let's get these presents open. Put your cookie down so you can open your present. Yes, open it.",
        "Lillian: I can't wait to see...",
        "Alan: And you're going to get two of them. Yeah.",
        "Lillian: How come they get two? Why don't I get two?",
        "Alan: Elizabeth.",
        "Olivia: Open yours.",
        "Alan: Come on. You get two.",
        "Frank: Harley is alive?",
        "Buzz: Yes. For all we know. But as far as the system knows, she's dead, and frank, it's going to stay that way.",
        "Frank: How did this happen? I mean, how did she... mallet. It was mallet. I heard he was collared at the scene, but how did she get away?",
        "Buzz: I don't know and i don't care. Sure, they're going to find out sooner or later that she's not dead. Frank, you and me and rick can buy her some time. All right? We're the difference between her getting caught and getting away, so don't you say a word. You keep your mouth shut, you hear me? Frank! Did you hear me?",
        "Frank: I don't have a choice. I need to find her before someone else finds her. Do you understand that?",
        "Cop: Answer me. Who's in here?",
        "Mel: I am. Who are you? Oh. Officer. Hello.",
        "Cop: This is private property. What are you doing in here, ma'am?",
        "Mel: I'm checking on something for the owner, a friend of mine. May I show you my id? Melissande bauer.",
        "Cop: Bauer. Any relation to rick bauer?",
        "Mel: I'm his wife.",
        "Cop: He's got a busy night ahead of him.",
        "Mel: That's right. Thank you for reminding me. I have to get over to the hospital because I've got to relieve him to get to the morgue. Okay. Clean and bandage your wound, and stay put.",
        "Harley: Thank you.",
        "Buzz: Frank, what's wrong with you? It's your sister we're talking about, not some anonymous perp.",
        "Frank: That's why I have to find her. If a fed or one of my fellow officers spots her-- a felon on the run-- are you kidding me? They're going to shoot first and ask questions later.",
        "Buzz: They're not going to know she's escaped unless you tell them, frank.",
        "Frank: Oh, right, dad. No one's going to recognize harley, right? No one from town, no one from the force. Are you kidding me? Someone's going to spot her.",
        "Buzz: You don't know that.",
        "Frank: Are you willing to take that chance, dad? Are you? ( Cell phone rings ) cooper here. Yeah, rick. It's rick. He's waiting for mel to relieve him at cedars. No, I'm here. What's up? Mel was where? No, no, that'S... no, thanks. Thanks, rick. I've got to go.",
        "Buzz: Where?",
        "Frank: I'm sorry, pop.",
        "Buzz: Frank? Frank, what are you sorry about? You know where she is, don't you? Frank!",
        "Alan: When the boys return...",
        "Beth: Alan, coop just picked zach up and I put james to sleep. It's way past his bedtime.",
        "Alexandra: Mine, too.",
        "Alan: Alexandra, remember when phillip was just about 12 years old? ( Thunder rumbles ) this was his favorite cake, remember? Carrot cake with the cream cheese.",
        "Olivia: Oh, stop it. Please. The kids are gone. This is dragging on and we're all miserable. ( Thunder rumbles )",
        "Lizzie: You know, for the first time, I actually agree with olivia.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, how can you not want to celebrate your father's birthday?",
        "Lizzie: No, I want to think about my dad in my own way on my own time, and however you want to do that, that's fine, okay, but I really resent you pulling us all in on your little drama, here.",
        "Alan: I am very sorry if you all feel that way. Far be it from me to keep you one minute past your own will.",
        "Beth: Alan, it'S...",
        "Alan: No, no, no. It's all right. But before you leave, I would like to make a toast to phillip. To phillip spaulding, a true visionary. A man who knew what he wanted and went after it and never conceded defeat. A man who loved his wives and children passionately. A son I am honored and proud to have been a father to, even in his darkest moments. I am grateful to have known you, phillip, to have loved you and to have called you my own. Happy birthday, son. ( Thunder crashes )",
        "Olivia: Oh, good lord, what's next?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, good question.",
        "Buzz: I owe you a big one for today, I know that. You've got to give me one more, though. Don't let frank find harley. He thinks it's the right thing, but it's not. You know frank. He's lost his perspective. He's so undone by not being able to help her in the first place that he doesn't know what he's doing right now, but she's out there. She's better off out there. Even if I never see her again. I can accept that. ( Thunder crashes ) frank can't, but I can. She didn't kill phillip, you know that. So it's justice. So be just.",
        "Mel: Oh, I'm sorry. You were hoping...",
        "Buzz: You know about harley.",
        "Mel: I got a call from the hospital. ( Thunder crashes ) buzz, I don't know what to say. Buzz, what do you know?",
        "Buzz: What do you know?",
        "Mel: What if harley survived that bus crash? ( Thunder crashes )",
        "Buzz: I hope she runs as fast as hell and gets as far away as she possibly can, until she's safe. I do not want my daughter back in that prison. What do you know?",
        "Mel: I saw her. She was hurt, but not bad, okay? Gus wanted me to see her. She's okay.",
        "Buzz: And gus is...",
        "Mel: Gus is out there, still trying to find the real killer and keep her safe. He went over to the spauldings.",
        "Buzz: She's alone?",
        "Mel: No, she's okay. Please, don't try to find her. It's just going to call attention.",
        "Frank: Harley! It's me. ( Thunder crashes ) I know you're here. Come on, honey. Come on out, please, before you get hurt. Come on, sweetie. Harley! ( Thunder rumbles ) damn.",
        "Alexandra: Breathe, darling.",
        "Gus: Hey, where's alan?",
        "Alexandra: Well, he said he went to look for a flashlight.",
        "Beth: You know, there should be one right in the desk.",
        "Lillian: Where?",
        "Beth: The top left drawer.",
        "Lillian: You know, there are matches here. I've got some matches right here.",
        "Beth: Oh, perfect.",
        "Alexandra: Here's a candle, for heaven's sake. ( Thunder crashes ) here you go.",
        "Lillian: Oh, does that help any?",
        "Beth: Oh, I guess I need a candle. Did lizzie go okay?",
        "Announcer: And there is still no confirmation on the victims of that prison van accident on route 17. Springfield county is under a severe thunderstorm watch until 3:00... ( thunder crashes )",
        "Buzz: Did you find her?",
        "Frank: No.",
        "Buzz: Thank god.",
        "Frank: You know what? You're being a little irrational, here. The best way to keep harley safe is to bring her back to the jail.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, that's if one of us stays with her 24/7. She's not safe at the jail. Now she doesn't even have mallet. Frank, thank god you didn't find her.",
        "Frank: You just don't like playing by the rules, do you?",
        "Buzz: Frank... ( thunder rumbles ) even I am not that immature. I'm just taking a different tack on this, frank. You know? Just leave it at that.",
        "Frank: I wish I could.",
        "Buzz: Well, why don't you, frank? Forget what I told you. You'd still be playing by the rules. You forget it and she's no longer alive.",
        "Frank: Dad, you id'd the body.",
        "Buzz: I id'd it myself. She was dead. I came out and told you that was her on the sheets. You believed it. It will work. What's the matter?",
        "Frank: You're living in some kind of fantasy world. Any second, someone could call over this radio and say that they spotted harley, and guess what? The entire state patrol would be looking for her and they'll be shooting to kill, dad. That's why I have to find her first.",
        "Beth: Found it.",
        "Alexandra: Ah.",
        "Beth: Well, hold on. Here, you take this.",
        "Lillian: It's okay, honey.",
        "Beth: Sweetie, why don't you take this? Okay?",
        "Lizzie: Okay, um, there's some more candles out in the closet. I guess I'll go get them.",
        "Beth: Okay, sure.",
        "Gus: Wait, wait, wait a second. Where'S... wait. Olivia? Where is she? ( Thunder crashes )",
        "Olivia: Well, that's it, phillip. The last of our little secret. Happy birthday and may you rot in hell.",
        "Harley: Burying evidence?",
        "Olivia: My gosh, you're alive.",
        "Harley: Yes. But don't worry, olivia. They're keeping my cell nice and warm for you. What do we have here? Ah. Letters. All addressed to phillip from you.",
        "Olivia: Full of sweet nothings and heartfelt declarations. Proof that I was once stupid enough to love the man, but hardly proof of anything else. ( Thunder crashing )",
        "Alan: Why, phillip? Why did you force me to shoot? ( Thunder crashing ) Next, on \"guiding light,\" brought to you by spray and wash.",
        "Alan: Happy birthday, phillip.",
        "Olivia: You've come back from the dead so you could prove that I killed phillip?",
        "Harley: Not if you didn't kill him.",
        "Olivia: You're so full of crap. You give me one good reason why I shouldn't turn you in right now."
