        "Tony finds a note about Eden meeting with Salerno and insists that he go with her. As they leave, a car tries to run them over, and Tony saves Eden. After she's alone, Eden calls the driver to thank him for such a realistic accident. Shayne is playing the good friend part to a T with Marina. She's very upset, and all Gus can do is tell her what a great girl she is and how Ben's the dumb one. Shayne tells her that all she did was throw herself at Ben, and that he might not have went elsewhere if she had made him work for it more. Marina thanks him for being honest. They go to the station, and Marina confronts Ben. Ben asks her to tell the police how they were together right before he found Ramona, and that she could clear him. She tells him that she wasn't watching the clock, and she's not going to lie to make up an alibi for him. Reva and Cassie are in the room starting to clean things up when Reva has a 'vision' about the murder. It looks suspiciously like Ben drowning Ramona, but Reva doesn't tell anyone that it's Ben-just that she was drown. Jeffrey is very interested in Reva's abilities, and that seems to make Cassie jealous. Holly comes to the Beacon and suggests a story on the murder to help Ben's case. Reva tells her that she'll do whatever needs to be done."

        "Marina: O thwhy you conveniently forgot to turn off your phone. So that you uld wear me do th dozs ofls until i ca herreed your alibi? Wasn't it enough to break my heart, ben? No, you had to set me up, too?",

So I can't say exactly when you were with me and when you were with ramona. I could make something up, but that would be lying, which seems to be your specialty and not mine. Me? I have too much self-respect. At asi'd likethink so.",
