        "Beth: Lizzie, why are you worried about Jonathan? How could he ruin things between you and Coop?",
        "Lizzie: ( Sighs ) Oh, my God, this is such a mess. Coop and I are supposed to be building a life together, and everywhere I look, it's Jonathan, Jonathan, Jonathan!",
        "Beth: Okay, okay.",
        "Lizzie: He's everywhere that I look.",
        "Beth: You're not making any sense.",
        "Lizzie: None of it makes any sense. It's all wrong. Coop should be the father of my baby.",
        "Beth: Wait a minute. You mean he isn't?",
        "Lizzie: No. Jonathan is.",
        "Beth: Jonathan? You and Jonathan...",
        "Lizzie: I know. It was one night. It was a mistake. I had a couple of drinks; he had a couple of drinks. We both had been dumped. I was angry. I was hurt and...",
        "Beth: Lizzie, why didn't you something? --Use something? Why didn't you...",
        "Lizzie: I know I should have been more careful. I should have done a thousand things differently, but it happened, and I'm pregnant.",
        "Beth: Oh, my God. Jonathan. I can't imagine a worse father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: We made a deal.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, we agreed to separate bedrooms, not a vow of chastity, so... I mean, technically, we're not breaking any rules.",
        "Tammy: R.J., hi. I thought you were studying.",
        "R.J.: I thought you were studying.",
        "Tammy: I was. I just took a break, and then Jonathan wanted to...",
        "Jonathan: Wrestle. We were wrestling.",
        "R.J.: You guys were kissing.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, that's the deal. The loser gets... forget it. Here, big man, go find yourself an ice cream truck.",
        "R.J.: A dollar. Thanks, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: You're welcome.",
        "Cassie: I'll take that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Stop it, stop it, stop it.",
        "Gus: Come on. There's always been a little something between us.",
        "Dinah: No, this is not about attraction. This is about revenge.",
        "Gus: So what's wrong with revenge? It could be fun. If anybody knows that, you do.",
        "Dinah: Gus, we are not crossing this line; stop it.",
        "Gus: Why not? Harley and Mallet crossed the line; they had a good time. Nobody was upset there, right?",
        "Dinah: Gus...",
        "Gus: Listen, listen. This is our time. Nobody's here. It's just you and me right now. You can call it revenge or payback. You can call it lust, whatever. And we get a little chance to even the score.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Wow! Ava, this is amazing. This is beautiful. It must have taken you hours-- days.",
        "Ava: Yeah, just a few.",
        "Harley: I don't get it. You're doing all of this for Coop?",
        "Ava: Well, wouldn't you do the same for Gus?",
        "Harley: Yes, but you and Coop aren't even together anymo-- I don't know what I'm talking about. Nobody's together anymore these days.",
        "Ava: I'm really sorry about you and Gus.",
        "Harley: Thanks.",
        "Ava: It's crazy that you guys aren't together. Why aren't you chasing after him?",
        "Harley: He doesn't want to be chased.",
        "Ava: No, forget it, that's crazy. Come on. You guys are in love. You can't just ignore it. It's not going to go away. You can't move on. You know you'll always be wanting him. And, I mean, Harley, you have to fight for the person that you love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Coop is the one that I love, okay? So I slept with Jonathan, but he doesn't ever have to know about this baby.",
        "Beth: He's the father!",
        "Lizzie: Biologically. Just think about it. You can buy what he gave me on the internet. It's like he is a donor. I mean, not a donor that I would have chosen, but--",
        "Beth: Lizzie, what have you done?!",
        "Lizzie: Just promise you won't give me away. My baby deserves a good, decent father like Coop, not some freako-loser like Jonathan. If you could just help me keep this a secret.",
        "Beth: I've got to think about this.",
        "Lizzie: There is nothing to think about, Mom. You've got to do what's right for this baby, and that is Coop. If you do, nobody is going to know the difference.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Gus, we both know how much you love Harley. Stop.",
        "Gus: Well... I was too, um, true. And too, um... loyal, and too faithful, I think. And everybody in town is probably laughing their... off at me.",
        "Dinah: Oh, yeah, that's what they're doing. 'Cause they have nothing better to do but to gossip about Gus Aitoro and how his wife cheated on him when he was dead.",
        "Gus: Well, I wasn't dead that long. That's the problem, see?",
        "Dinah: No. No. You're right. You're back. You're back. And you know what, I'll tell you something. Hey, if people weighed what you did against what Harley did, you know what they'd say? They would say, you know what, bud, get over it, get over it.",
        "Gus: I don't understand. It's okay what Mallet did?",
        "Dinah: No. No. But I've forgiven him?",
        "Gus: It's okay with you what Harley did?",
        "Dinah: No. But you know what? She... she's not getting back together with Mallet. They're not looking for a house with a white picket fence, and it was one slip.",
        "Gus: When did you get so... um... rational, so reasonable?",
        "Dinah: Because I've never had a man who loves me like Mallet has. And every time I get a little bit jealous, I just remind myself that that man would do anything for me, just like Harley would do anything for you. Gus, honey, don't you want to give her another chance?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Sorry about the lecture.",
        "Harley: No, don't apologize. I think you're right. Maybe I am giving up on Gus too easily. I think if you love somebody, you should be able to get past just about anything, right?",
        "Coop: Yeah.",
        "Harley: Bye.",
        "Coop: Right. Bye, Harley.",
        "Ava: Bye, Harley.",
        "Coop: Wow, Ava, this looks great.",
        "Ava: Well, I should have been finished a while ago. I'm sorry I'm still here.",
        "Coop: No, please, Ava, this place looks amazing. I mean I can't believe you did all of this stuff on your own. I mean you've got some real creativity here. You should be like a designer-- a painter even.",
        "Ava: I am a painter.",
        "Coop: Okay. Look, Ava, please. There you go. I'm being serious here. You've got some real creative ability, I bet.",
        "Ava: Well, I was actually thinking about putting maybe some stars up here in the corner, you know, so it looks like an evening...",
        "Coop: A starry night-type thing?",
        "Ava: Yeah, I don't know and then maybe like some baby... ( screams ) Oh, my gosh.",
        "Coop: It's okay.",
        "Ava: Oh, my gosh.",
        "Coop: It's all right. No...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Just promise me that you're not going to say anything.",
        "Beth: And Jonathan isn't suspicious? He believes that this baby is Coop's?",
        "Lizzie: I mean it took a lot of work, but believe me, he does not want this baby to be his anymore than I do.",
        "Beth: That, I believe. Honey, you can't understand how complicated this can get. I've been there, I know.",
        "Lizzie: It's different. It's different. Look, I only want the best for my baby. And if you love me and if you love this baby, you just won't say anything.",
        "Beth: Damn it, Lizzie! You of all people should have known better. And, Jonathan-- do you understand the problems he could cause?",
        "Lizzie: No, no, no. He won't. He loves Tammy. The last thing he wants in his life is my baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: All right, up to your room, and pack up a few things because we've got to get going.",
        "R.J.: But I want to stay and see the fight.",
        "Cassie: There isn't going to be a fight, now go. And if you were just a little bit younger, I'd send you to your room, too.",
        "Tammy: I know what you're thinking, but...",
        "Cassie: But what? Explain this to me. What, Jonathan wasn't just trying to bribe your little brother to get lost so you two could mess around on the sofa?",
        "Jonathan: Okay. I mean, guys have been paying off little brothers for centuries.",
        "Cassie: And, what, you were respecting tradition? How about respecting our ground rules?",
        "Jonathan: We did respect the ground rules. We're sleeping in separate rooms. I didn't sneak in to be with her.",
        "Tammy: We thought we were alone, Mom.",
        "Cassie: And what if R.J. had walked in just a few minutes later, honey? What exactly would he have seen then?",
        "Jonathan: What does he see on the internet or on the nature channel? Birds do it, bees do it...",
        "Cassie: I don't ...you don't! And not in my house. That was the deal. And, you know, talk about long- standing tradition, Jonathan, how about your complete inability to control yourself?",
        "Tammy: It wasn't just him, Mom.",
        "Cassie: I agreed to take you in, but not at the expense of your little brother. So it is time to go.",
        "Tammy: You're kicking us out?",
        "Cassie: If you need money for a room, I will help you. But I don't want any more trouble, so it is time to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Jonathan is trouble. He bounces in and out of jail like a rubber ball. He's bad-tempered; he's unpredictable. And don't even get me started on that hair. God, I hope my baby doesn't inherit that hair.",
        "Beth: Do you hear yourself? That hair. His hair, eyes-- you look like me. What if this baby...",
        "Lizzie: Coop has brown hair, too. It won't be a problem if you just keep your mouth shut.",
        "Beth: You can't hide something like this. I know, it is bound to come out sooner or later.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, I choose later. Don't you want me to be happy?",
        "Beth: Of course I do.",
        "Lizzie: I shouldn't have told you. I actually thought that you were going to help me. I thought that you loved me.",
        "Beth: Lizzie, Lizzie. Wait. What just happened to me? Hmm, what?",
        "Lizzie: You lost your baby.",
        "Beth: That's right. All I have are you and James. Your happiness means everything to me.",
        "Lizzie: Then don't say a word. We can't let Jonathan ruin my life.",
        "Reva: Excuse me, what did you just say about my son?",
        "Beth: We uh... we weren't talking about Jonathan.",
        "Reva: Sounded like it to me.",
        "Lizzie: Actually, Mom, we should just tell her. We were chatting about how everything that's happened to Jonathan is really unfair.",
        "Reva: Which is what?",
        "Lizzie: You know, the charges, that girl Ashlee that he got drunk? God, she is a total liar.",
        "Reva: Is she?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, totally. Jonathan will get off. I'm sure of it.",
        "Reva: Well, it's nice that you care so much about my son. I didn't realize you were a friend of his. That's nice.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, well, I care about Tammy.",
        "Reva: Oh, yeah, right.",
        "Beth: So, what brings you to Cedars, Reva?",
        "Reva: I was here gathering medical statistics for a press package for Josh's new project. Beth, I heard about your miscarriage. I'm really so sorry. My heart goes out to anyone who has a baby and loses it.",
        "Beth: Thank you. Well, it would be unbearable if it weren't for Lizzie's baby. Right now all that matters is that she and that baby have the best future possible.",
        "Reva: It's good to hear you say that.",
        "Beth: Well, we have to get going. A doctor's appointment. It's good to see you, Reva?",
        "Reva: Yeah. Excuse me. You, too. Have a good day.",
        "Lizzie: Do you think she...",
        "Beth: No. I don't think so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: R.J. and I are going to Oklahoma today for the groundbreaking on Josh's veteran's hospital complex. And we're going early so that R.J. can see Rusty.",
        "Tammy: And let me guess, you want us gone by the time you get back.",
        "Cassie: Well, I...",
        "Jonathan: It's okay. Cassie, we're as good as gone.",
        "Cassie: Honey, I don't mean to be such a hard-nosed about this, but this is the way it has to be. Sweetie, I do love you. R.J.!",
        "Tammy: What are we waiting for? Let's get our stuff and get out of here. How hard can it be to find another place? We don't need this house. I don't even want to stay here another minute.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, it's always going to be hard for that like us here, so... why don't we just go find another place, huh? A new town, me and you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: I'm not...",
        "Dinah: Let it go! Will you let it go?! All of this... all of this is empty, Gus! Don't you see that?!",
        "Gus: All I see is Harley touching him and kissing him.",
        "Dinah: Gus, listen to me. Honey, if anybody knows about this, it's me. I know that feeling and what your imagination can do. It lives inside of you, and it eats you up from the inside out until there's nothing left of you, nothing for Harley to come back to and nothing for her to love.",
        "Gus: Well, help me. Can you help me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: ( Laughing )",
        "Coop: Oh, gosh, that's horrible.",
        "Ava: Maybe you should take off your pants.",
        "Coop: What? Okay, sure.",
        "Ava: Not now!",
        "Coop: I'm just kidding.",
        "Ava: Okay, thanks. Just take your pants off and put them in the washer before the paint dries. I'm sorry.",
        "Coop: You know what, Ava? Just forget it. I think they'll have to be my painter's pants from now on.",
        "Ava: Good idea.",
        "Coop: Thanks. Look, you didn't think I was going to let you paint this entire nursery by yourself, did you?",
        "Ava: Well, it was a gift.",
        "Coop: I know it was a gift, but now you might as well tell me what to do. Otherwise, I'm just going to get creative.",
        "Ava: No, no, no! Please don't get creative. Okay, um... why don't you help me with the molding? The molding, yeah.",
        "Coop: The molding?",
        "Ava: Around the door. The choo-choo tracks, there.",
        "Coop: Yes?",
        "Ava: Perfect.",
        "Coop: Okay. All right. Okay. First, you must hold the brush in your hand. Then you must bend the knees. It's in the bending of the knees that you get the artistic talent. That's what you've got to do. Then you take it and you let the inner Michelangelo come out and you go... fump! And you just throw the paint on there just like this.",
        "Ava: Okay, Mike? Mike, Mike, Mike?",
        "Coop: Yes, what are you talking about?",
        "Ava: Tape... blue tape. How about taping the sides there?",
        "Coop: Would you... don't insult the master when...",
        "Ava: ( Screams )",
        "Coop: Oh, gosh. I'm sorry. ( Laughs ) Whoa, hey, easy.",
        "Ava: Bring it on, master.",
        "Coop: Again?",
        "Ava: Yeah.",
        "Coop: Are you kidding? Whoa... hey. Okay. Again.",
        "Ava: Ha-ha.",
        "Coop: It doesn't taste very good, thank you. You know what?",
        "Ava: Come on, come on.",
        "Coop: You are going down really hard.",
        "Ava: You didn't hear me. I said bring it on.",
        "Coop: You don't want any of it.",
        "Ava: ( Makes whipping sound )",
        "Coop: Okay, okay. You know what?",
        "Ava: ( Screams )",
        "Coop: Okay. Come here. Come here!",
        "Ava: ( Laughing ) Oh, my God. Are you okay?",
        "Coop: You are covered in paint. I'm sorry, let me just get that off your neck. No, don't lick it. That's disgusting.",
        "Ava: ( Laughs )",
        "Coop: I am so sorry.",

        "Tammy: Just you and me, huh?",
        "Jonathan: We don't have to go. It was just an idea.",
        "Tammy: No, you're right. If we stay here, we're just always going to be trying to justify who we are and why we belong together. Someplace else people won't even know that we're cousins.",
        "Jonathan: Really? You're in?",
        "Tammy: It's time to grow up and get some distance from my mom, stand on my own.",
        "Jonathan: Uh-uh, you'll never been on your own. --Be on your own.",

        "Tammy: Yes, I'm sure. I'll miss my mom and R.J., and aunt Reva and Uncle Josh, but...",
        "Jonathan: But?",
        "Tammy: It's a great idea, an adventure. I'll go get our things, and then we'll find a place to stay tonight; then, I don't know, throw darts at the map and figure out where we're going to live.",

        "Jonathan: Let me guess. You got into another fight?",
        "Reva: No, but I was tempted. I backed off because I figured I'd leave this up to you.",
        "Jonathan: What are you talking about?",
        "Reva: There is something you need to know.",

        "Dinah: Okay, you stop it. Stop it! Stop it! I'm going to call the police-- the other police. Now, you leave him alone. This is not what it looks like.",
        "Mallet: Oh, really? He wasn't all over you trying to kiss you?",
        "Dinah: No, he's upset. He's had too much to drink. He's upset about Harley.",

        "Mallet: Hey, man, if you want to destroy your life and destroy your relationship and not save it, you go ahead. I don't give a damn. But don't you dare get in the way of mine. Let's go. You all right?",
        "Dinah: I think we should stay and help him, Mallet.",

        "Harley: Yeah. Yeah, Gus, I want more.",
        "Gus: What are you doing?",
        "Harley: You want to hate me for what happened with Mallet? Fine. You want to hate me for asking Frank to give you leave? Fine. At least let me stop the bleeding, though.",
        "Gus: It's a pretty deep wound.",
        "Harley: Not too deep to heal, if you just give it a chance. Who were you expecting when I came in?",
        "Gus: Our friend Mallet came by to defend the honor of his girlfriend.",
        "Harley: Dinah? What happened?",
        "Gus: Nothing. I couldn't even get a decent revenge on, so...",

        "Mallet: You like that? Me defending your honor?",
        "Dinah: Yeah.",
        "Mallet: Whatever works.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, it was very sexy. You know, what if I told you I kind of liked Gus kissing me?",
        "Mallet: Did you?",
        "Dinah: What if?",
        "Mallet: Well, I know you're not a block of ice. So you probably responded a little bit, but you probably didn't respond the way you did with me.",
        "Dinah: I kind of like it when you're jealous-- a little jealous, I like it.",
        "Mallet: ( Laughing ) I'll remember that.",
        "Dinah: Uh-huh. Why don't you get recharged? And I'll be right back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: I'm going to miss having you next to me.",
        "Ava: Yeah?",
        "Coop: In the room next to me, I mean.",
        "Ava: It's for the better, anyways. You can concentrate on your writing and your family. Right? And you don't have to worry about someone listening through the wall or wondering if you're awake at night.",
        "Coop: Whoa, whoa, wait a minute! You did that?",
        "Ava: Once or twice.",
        "Coop: Uh-huh. Once or twice.",
        "Ava: Yeah.",
        "Coop: Well, since we're confessing, I think I should tell you that I actually enjoyed hanging out outside of your door, listening to you sing along to the radio and cd's and tapes and whatever.",
        "Ava: So, do you know how to change a stinky diaper?",
        "Coop: Sure. Yes, I've done it once or twice... not really, no. I don't know how to do much, actually. What? You're thinking something.",
        "Ava: I'm thinking your baby is really lucky to have you.",
        "Lizzie: We both are. Oh, gosh! Coop, it's beautiful. I can't believe you did all of this for our baby.",
        "Coop: Actually...",
        "Lizzie: You know what, I don't even know why I would say something like that. Of course you would do this. This is so you.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, this is so Ava.",
        "Lizzie: What?",
        "Coop: It was her idea. She's done all of this for the nursery. It's pretty great, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Cassie, she took... all R.J. saw was me and Tammy kissing...",
        "Reva: I don't even know what the hell you're talking about.",
        "Jonathan: Oh. What then? What do you have to tell me?",
        "Reva: You are so much like me, it's scary sometimes. You're impulsive, emotional, acting out when you think somebody's hurt you. Giving up so much of yourself, and most of the time, you can't take it back. Everything changes in an instant.",
        "Jonathan: What's going on?",
        "Reva: Oh, Jonathan. I was at the hospital earlier, and I heard something. It was just by fluke that I happened to be there, but I don't believe in chance. And I heard what I heard because you have a right to know.",
        "Tammy: Okay. One down, one to... oh, hey, Reva.",
        "Reva: Hi.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, my mom's got something important to tell me.",
        "Reva: Sweetie, do you think I could have a moment alone with Jonathan?",
        "Jonathan: No. It's all right. Me and Tammy don't keep secrets. You can tell us anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Did you miss me?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, yeah, you bet. Did you, uh... did you get a postcard today?",
        "Dinah: No. Did you send me one?",
        "Mallet: Uh... no. I just... I'm getting a lot of junk mail lately, and I just couldn't keep it all straight.",
        "Dinah: Honey?",
        "Mallet: Hmm?",
        "Dinah: I'm dressed like this and you're talking about junk mail? I don't think so. Maybe I should send you one: \"Dear A.C., It's so lonely here on this side of my bed. I wish you were here.\"",
        "Mallet: Hmm. \"Dear Dinah, I did receive a postcard, and it got me thinking about you. Then I had this dream that you were lying in bed and your hair was all messed up and you looked so damn sexy.\" Oh, I forgot... I forgot something.",
        "Dinah: \"Dearest Mallet, why are you double-bolting the door?\"",
        "Mallet: \"Dear Dinah, I'll show you the second I get my hands on you.\"",

        "Harley: We fought so long and so hard to be together, and look at us still fighting it out.",
        "Gus: I'm done fighting.",
        "Harley: I miss you. I know what we have isn't perfect, but it doesn't have to be. I love what we have. Baby, come back to me. Come back to the kids. Come back to our bed.",
        "Gus: I'm not quite... quite myself these days.",
        "Harley: You will be by morning. And then we can try again. We can beat this thing, baby. We can do it. Together, we can do anything if we're together, right?",
        "Gus: I have some place I've got to be. Thanks for trying to treat the wound.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Ava, really? Wow! Um, this does look incredible. It's almost designer quality if you don't look at it too closely.",
        "Coop: ( Clearing his throat )",
        "Lizzie: That... that was a compliment. It was.",
        "Ava: Thank you.",
        "Lizzie: Actually, I don't know how to thank you. It was so gracious of you to give up your room for my baby, our baby.",
        "Ava: Well, there isn't anything I wouldn't do for Coop and his child. Oh. I forgot.",
        "Coop: What?",
        "Lizzie: Wow, it's cute.",
        "Coop: Che guevara. Rad.",
        "Ava: It's just a little reminder for the baby that money and power aren't everything. I'm late for my shift. See you at work.",
        "Lizzie: Wow! Just think, if I hadn't gotten pregnant, you could have gotten yourself one of these and be on your way to Peru or somewhere, wherever, on a motorcycle.",
        "Coop: Yeah. Right now I'm just looking forward to being a father, being able to hold our baby.",
        "Lizzie: Are you just saying that?",
        "Coop: No, I'm not just saying that. All right, yes, I was a little freaked out at first, but I can't wait to be a father.",
        "Lizzie: I can't wait either. I think I'm going to like you being a daddy, the daddy.",
        "Coop: I can't say that the timing was very good, but everything happens for a reason, right?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: My mom told you she kicked us out.",
        "Jonathan: No, she hasn't seen Cassie.",
        "Reva: No, I didn't know. You're welcome to stay at my place.",
        "Tammy: Well, thank you, but no thank you. Jonathan and I are going to do this on our own. It will be us against the world.",
        "Jonathan: I think the world had better look out.",
        "Tammy: Are you hungry?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah.",
        "Tammy: Burgers?",
        "Jonathan: It works for me.",
        "Tammy: Are you hungry? You want anything?",
        "Reva: No, I'm fine. Where are you going?",
        "Jonathan: Just away.",
        "Reva: Far away?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, you're going to find out sooner or later anyway. Once the trial... once that's all done, we're going to go-- I mean, anywhere, just to get away.",
        "Reva: You can't do that.",
        "Jonathan: Don't worry. I'll buy you a big, ugly sofa bed so you can visit...",
        "Reva: No, I'm telling you. You can't leave town right now.",
        "Jonathan: Why not? I'm tired of this. I'm tired of everything being so complicated and everybody trying to break me and Tammy up. Just give me one reason why I shouldn't go.",
        "Reva: Because you're going to be a father.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Lizzie: I'm moving back in. At least I'll be a single mom getting a lot of TLC.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, I can't let you do that.",
        "Reva: Tammy knows.",
        "Tammy: I know what?",
        "Reva: Congratulations, Jonathan. You're going to be a daddy."
