        "Blake: Have you heard from Cassie?",

        "Blake: You, mister, I will be back at 4:00, all right, darling? You have a good time with Auntie Reva. Thank you.",
        "Reva: See you later. You know what, partner? How about you go and get us a couple of Italian ices? What do you say? Take that. Head on over to the ice cream man. Hurry back. Okay.",
        "Josh: Josh's pleasure palace.",
        "Reva: And I thought I was calling my husband!",
        "Josh: What are you up to, darling?",
        "Reva: We're outside with Will and I thought you might want to join us.",
        "Josh: I can't. I'm sorry. I'm pretty swamped here.",
        "Reva: Too swamped to put some suntan lotion on your wife's back?",
        "Josh: Hey! Play fair!",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) Okay. Maybe later.",
        "Josh: Listen, darling, I've got an axe hanging over my head right now. I'll have to get back to you, okay?",
        "Reva: Sure.",
        "Nate: Need a hand?",

        "Tammy: Morning.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, what's up, Tammy? This building better be on fire for you to be waking me up this early.",
        "Tammy: It's not that early.",
        "Jonathan: I just went to bed a few hours ago.",
        "Woman: Can I borrow your toothbrush?",
        "Jonathan: Be my guest.",
        "Woman: Thank you.",
        "Tammy: Busy night.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, yeah. Hey, we're two consenting adults. And, anyway, she's the one who picked me up. So...",
        "Tammy: Brand new friend.",
        "Jonathan: Uh-huh.",
        "Tammy: So what's her name?",
        "Jonathan: Summer, I think. I don't remember. Why don't you come on in and ask her. You two have a lot in common.",
        "Tammy: I'm gonna leave now.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, wait. You don't have to. You say the word and I'll kick her out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Cassie Winslow, yes. All right, fine. If you see her or if she calls, please let me know. Thank you. Where are you, Cassie? Where are you?",
        "Dinah: Did you say something?",
        "Edmund: Just going a little crazy waiting for Cassie. What are you doing wearing a wash cloth?",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs ) Well, with my tummy getting bigger and bigger, it's getting harder and harder to cover. What a nice shower. Awfully relaxing. You look like you need to be relaxed, too. Come on. Why don't we work on that?",
        "Edmund: I'll relax when Cassie gets back.",
        "Dinah: Cassie is fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Get... excuse me!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Now worrying is such a waste of energy. Cassie can take care of herself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Look, look, you're making a huge mistake. I used to be the princess of this island. You can't do this to me! Hello?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Get dressed, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: Edmund, come on. I'm not a fool. You may have \"no\" on your lips but I think there's a \"yes\" somewhere in those eyes.",
        "Edmund: I'm a man, Dinah, and you're half naked.",
        "Dinah: What do you think I should do with the other half?",
        "Edmund: Get dressed and stop playing games.",
        "Dinah: Well, we can't do much until Cassie shows. All we have is time. You know what? Just rub my back.",
        "Edmund: What? Why.",
        "Dinah: Because it hurts. It hurts. I'm compensating with extra weight for the baby.",
        "Edmund: Dinah, you're barely showing.",
        "Dinah: After everything I've done for you, don't you think you could manage a little back rub?",
        "Edmund: No, I can't.",
        "Dinah: Edmund? You know, I'm carrying your baby and your secret. I'm your accomplice. You say you love Cassie, then you lie to her. You scheme and you encourage Alonzo to take her child away from her.",
        "Edmund: I encouraged him to fight for Will, that doesn't mean I want him to succeed.",
        "Cassie: You know, I can blow your dreams right out of the water, but I don't complain and I don't judge. I don't ask much from you.",
        "Edmund: Are you threatening me, Dinah? I came down here to help Cassie keep her son, not to play footsy with you every time we're alone. Now here, get dressed and stop playing games.",
        "Dinah: Oh, I'm not playing games. And you of all people should know you can't help who you fall in love with.",
        "Edmund: I'm in love with Cassie.",
        "Dinah: No, that's the woman you've decided you're in love with. She'll never love you back. Not like I will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: You really are a sleaze.",
        "Jonathan: Have I ever acted like I was anything different?",
        "Tammy: Once.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. Since then?",
        "Tammy: Who is she? Do you care about her?",
        "Jonathan: Care about her? I just met her last night.",
        "Tammy: Yeah.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, don't give me the whole you-have-to-have feelings-for-someone- to-sleep with-them deal because that's not my bag.",
        "Tammy: I'm not a kid, I get it.",
        "Jonathan: So?",
        "Tammy: So I don't get it, okay? I don't. How can you be with someone you don't even care about and I...",
        "Jonathan: You what?",
        "Tammy: Nothing.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, hey, what's up with you?",
        "Tammy: Nothing.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy, you didn't even tell me why you came to my room yet.",
        "Tammy: It's not important.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, Tammy, you avoid that room like it's the plague. You must have had a reason.",
        "Tammy: I wanted to ask you a question.",
        "Jonathan: What?",
        "Tammy: A favor. It's for work. Uncle Josh said I could come with him to a client meeting and help with the presentation.",
        "Jonathan: Field trip. Cool. Can I come?",
        "Tammy: This really could be important for me, okay? And I have to leave in a little while. I just thought I'd practice my pitch on you.",
        "Jonathan: Me? Why me? I don't even know anything.",
        "Tammy: Well, you know how to play people, so who better?",
        "Jonathan: You got a point there.",
        "Tammy: So, will you help he?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, sure. Why not.",
        "Tammy: I have a proposal here somewhere.",
        "Jonathan: All right. First things first. What are you wearing?",
        "Tammy: This. I'm wearing this.",
        "Jonathan: Big mistake.",

        "Sebastian: Nice day, isn't it?",
        "Josh: Yes, it is.",
        "Sebastian: Been outside much?",
        "Josh: Sebastian, you're circling.",
        "Sebastian: Come on. You're paranoid.",
        "Josh: I recognize the flight pattern of a vulture when I see it.",
        "Sebastian: Gosh, Josh, there's just no beating around the bush with you, is there?",
        "Josh: You helped me get wspr. [cant make this out]",
        "Sebastian: At a stellar price I might add.",
        "Josh: Now I'm sitting around here waiting for you to call in this favor.",
        "Sebastian: I thought we were working together on this.",
        "Josh: We were.",
        "Sebastian: Then why am I getting the funny feeling that your heart isn't in it anymore?",
        "Josh: You helped me and now I help you, right? That's the deal. Within reason.",
        "Sebastian: See? See? There it is again. That hesitation.",
        "Josh: I have better things to do with my life than start with war with Alan Spaulding.",
        "Sebastian: I'm not asking you to start a war with Alan Spaulding. All I'm asking you is to be on the offensive.",
        "Josh: Well, isn't that how wars are started these days?",
        "Sebastian: Look, there has never been a more perfect time to go after the Spaulding's.",
        "Josh: Sebastian, just tell me what you want.",
        "Sebastian: Simple, I want you to be my buddy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: You missed a spot. Do you mind?",
        "Reva: No.",
        "Nate: I just hope...",
        "Reva: Whoa. Nate:... That you can control yourself.",
        "Reva: Excuse me?",
        "Nate: I know what my touch does to the ladies.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) What are you doing out here, anyway? I wouldn't peg you as a sun worshiper.",
        "Nate: I'm not a vampire. I'm just British.",
        "Reva: Okay, that's good. Thank you.",
        "Nate: Sure.",
        "Reva: Okay. It's really chilly here.",
        "Nate: I've got a great idea. Why don't we head down to the ach [can't make this out] and rent a speedboat. We'll take a ride. We'll go as fast or slow as you like.",
        "Reva: Oh, hey! There he is! That looks so good! Which one do you want? Red one, yum.",
        "Nate: Is this yours?",
        "Reva: It's my sister's Cassie son's Will.",
        "Agent Nixon: Mrs. Lewis? I'm agent Nixon and this is agent Fox.",
        "Agent Fox: We're prince Alonzo's security unit. Hi, Will. We're here to take young Will to see his mother.",
        "Reva: Oh, no, no, you don't. I'm going to start a riot in",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Hello?! I'm going to start a riot in here! Hello?! Get over here! No, let me tell you something. I want to talk to Alonzo. Do you hear me? You better get Alonzo for me.",
        "Guard: Hold on! I'll see what I can do.",
        "Cassie: Oh, thank god it worked.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Dinah, you wouldn't understand. Cassie brings out something in me I've never felt before.",
        "Dinah: Please. You know, let's just cut to the chase. The reason why you're begging for her love is because you're a man desperate to find redemption. You figure if Cassie loves you, you'll finally be worthy to be loved.",
        "Edmund: Is something wrong with that?",
        "Dinah: No. Nothing. That's just not love. It's called need. You know, with me you are yourself. I mean, I... I don't need you to lie to me. I don't think I've ever made you feel ashamed. I mean, you don't owe me. If a man looked sideways at me on the street and you removed him from the planet, I think I would give you a standing ovation. Look, Edmund, you can love who you want to love, but just be honest about that love. And what's really in it for you. ( Cell phone rings ) just let it ring. Let it ring.",
        "Edmund: Cassie? Cassie, where are you? Oh, my god. Right. We're on our way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: There's nothing wrong with this dress.",
        "Jonathan: You're right, if you're going to run out and teach Sunday school.",
        "Tammy: I suppose you think I should dress more like your friend Summer, right?",
        "Jonathan: Why not?",
        "Tammy: Because she was naked. I can only imagine what she was wearing last night when you took her home.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, it got her what she wanted, didn't it?",
        "Tammy: This is a business meeting.",
        "Jonathon: With a bunch of guys, right?",
        "Tammy: Yes.",
        "Jonathan: Trust me. All guys respond to the same thing, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: Well, I would like to be taken seriously.",
        "Jonathan: Believe me, you will be. I'm not saying you've got to dress like a whore, I'm just saying you got to use what you got.",
        "Tammy: Like maybe my brains or my creativity.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, that, too.",
        "Tammy: It shouldn't matter what I look like.",
        "Jonathan: But it does. Especially with guys.",
        "Tammy: Not all guys are like you. Sex isn't all that it's about.",
        "Jonathan: Not to you, maybe. But something happens when a guy looks at you. I mean, nobody's immune.",
        "Tammy: Get out.",
        "Jonathan: You just... I was just giving you my opinion.",
        "Tammy: I made a mistake.",
        "Jonathan: I didn't mean to freak you out.",
        "Tammy: Just go.",
        "Jonathan: Wait, wait. Just hear me out one second.",
        "Tammy: Why should I? You think I'm some kind of freakish prude.",
        "Jonathan: No, I don't. I don't! Tammy, I think you're beautiful.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: I want you to be my buddy, my pal, my compadre. Or at least pretend to be.",
        "Josh: Why?",
        "Sebastian: In case you haven't noticed it, Josh, I have a very bad rep in this town. Roger Thorpe's son, you know. And I need some good P.R. And you are one of the most well- respected men in Springfield. Everyone likes you.",
        "Josh: That's good to know.",
        "Sebastian: So I figure if people see us together, then maybe they'll start changing their minds about me.",
        "Josh: What about Alan? He's not going to like seeing us together.",
        "Sebastian: That's no problem. I'll tell him I'm keeping my enemies close.",
        "Blake: Hey.",
        "Sebastian: Chrissie.",
        "Blake: Sorry I'm late. What'd I miss.",
        "Josh: Well, your brother was just calling in the favor I owe him.",
        "Blake: Oh.",
        "Josh: Yeah. He wants me to be his friend.",
        "Blake: Oh.",
        "Josh: I'm confused myself.",
        "Blake: I didn't say that.",
        "Josh: You didn't have to.",
        "Sebastian: Josh...",
        "Josh: No, no, no. Just a second. Sebastian. Blake, you know your brother a whole lot better than I do. What does he want from me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Cassie, are you all right?",
        "Cassie: Edmund! Oh, I'm so glad you're here.",
        "Edmund: Open the cell immediately.",
        "Guard: I'm sorry, ambassador, I can't do that. You lifted my cell phone!",
        "Cassie: I just need to talk Alonzo.",
        "Edmund: Thank you, come here, cassi...",
        "Dinah: Get your hands off me.",
        "Cassie: Leave her alone! Oh!",
        "Dinah: That went well.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: You're not taking Will to Sand Cristobel, I don't know you guys.",
        "Nate: Whoa, she just told you to beat it. I suggest you leave. You're scaring the kid. Gentlemen, in that building is a room full of people that love this woman. Now, one word from her and you'll be surrounded by a gaggle of angry diners with forks and knives. Look, I'm a peaceful man, but I can't vouch for your safety should that lunch mob just become a mob.",
        "Agent one: Who are you?",
        "Nate: I'm the guy that's saving your life. Have you ever wondered what it's like to be a pot pie?",
        "Reva: Go. Now.",
        "Agent two: This isn't over.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) Oh, yes, it is. If I see either one of your faces again, I will call the cops. Come here, sweetie. Sit right here, okay? You okay? Good. You can eat that now. ( Sighs ) thank you.",
        "Nate: I don't think they'll come back.",
        "Reva: Well, they'd be stupid if they did.",
        "Nate: Do you want to tell me what's going on?",
        "Reva: It's a long, complicated story.",
        "Nate: Okay.",
        "Reva: Why they thought they could take a kid away from his mother is beyond me. I don't understand how people can mistreat a child. It just brings up really bad things in me.",
        "Nate: It's okay. It's okay.",
        "Reva: Thank you for being here, for being my backup. I'm glad you were here.",
        "Nate: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Reva: Oh, thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I just wish we were home.",
        "Edmund: So do I. Soon. Very soon.",
        "Guard: Good news, you're out of here.",
        "Edmund: Good.",
        "Cassie: Oh, thank heavens.",
        "Guard: Just her.",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: Will you tell your husband?",
        "Reva: About the kiss?",
        "Nate: Well, now's your chance.",
        "Reva: What? Hey!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: If Sebastian said he just wants one thing from you, I'm sure that's all he wants.",
        "Josh: Do you trust him?",
        "Blake: He's my brother.",
        "Josh: You're not answering my question, Blake.",
        "Blake: Look, Josh, Sebastian wouldn't have asked you to be his friend if it wasn't going to help get Alan. That's our common goal, right?",
        "Josh: Sorry, I'm still not sold.",
        "Sebastian: Don't put my sister in the middle of this. It's not fair to her.",
        "Josh: You're right. I'm sorry, Blake, I shouldn't ask you to choose between your newly acquired brother and somebody you've known for a very long time.",
        "Blake: I don't even know what to say.",
        "Sebastian: Than why say anything, Chrissie? It seems to work best for you.",
        "Josh: Ooh. On that happy note, I'll leave you two alone.",
        "Blake: You don't have to go, Josh.",
        "Sebastian: Where are we leaving things, Josh?",
        "Josh: I'll be in touch.",
        "Sebastian: You do that. But don't take too long, okay?",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Sebastian: Well, thanks for the support, sis.",
        "Blake: He so put me on the spot.",
        "Sebastian: No, he didn't, actually. He asked you a very straightforward question.",
        "Blake: Come on, I came in the middle of your conversation.",
        "Sebastian: Do that again, Chrissie, and you're out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Come here. You're beautiful.",
        "Tammy: You're not just messing with me.",
        "Jonathan: No. Tammy, take the compliment. It's not often that I dish them out.",
        "Tammy: You really think I'm beautiful?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah.",
        "Tammy: Why?",
        "Jonathan: I don't know. I just do.",
        "Tammy: That's the best you can come up with?",
        "Jonathan: It's not just your looks. It's everything that you have inside of you and how you listen to people and how you understand them and how you get to them.",
        "Tammy: You just said it was all about sex.",
        "Jonathan: Just be yourself. With a different dress.",
        "Tammy: Do you really think that's enough?",
        "Jonathan: Do I think that what's enough?",
        "Tammy: Being myself with guys. The guys at the meeting.",
        "Jonathan: We're not talking about the guys at the meeting. We're talking about Sandy, aren't we?",
        "Tammy: No.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, come on. You brought all this up. What's going on with you and the sand man?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: At least let us see a lawyer.",
        "Edmund: They don't have to let us do anything.",
        "Guard: You, come with me.",
        "Dinah: No, I'm not going with you.",
        "Edmund: Don't touch her. She's not going anywhere. I want you to listen to me very carefully. You may have us locked up in here but I have powerful friends on this island who will hunt you down.",
        "Dinah: Thank you.",
        "Edmund: This is too much stress for you.",
        "Cassie: Are you all right, Dinah?",
        "Dinah: No. We may never get out of here.",
        "Cassie: We're going to get out of here, okay? Alonzo is not going to keep us locked up in here.",
        "Dinah: How do you know that? There's no air in here. I can't. I can't be in here, I need to get out.",
        "Cassie: I need you to come over here and sit down. Let's go. Have a seat. Just sit down and relax.",
        "Dinah: I cannot be in here.",
        "Cassie: Dinah, everything is going to be fine.",
        "Dinah: I can't breathe. I can't breathe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: It's... you know, I just really hate when people do things to kids. It gets to me.",
        "Nate: It's because you're a good person with a big heart.",
        "Reva: Well, I don't know about that.",
        "Nate: I do. Do you want to know something? I would think you would have been just fine even if I hadn't been here.",
        "Reva: I'm glad you were here, though. You always seem to be around when I need you.",
        "Nate: Glad to help. Mission accomplished. They didn't take the kid. Talking of which, we haven't been introduced.",
        "Reva: Oh, I am so sorry. Will, Will, Will... he loves his ice cream, this is my boss....",
