        "Jonathan - In the Light Baby Daddy",
        "Jonathan remembers hearing Reva's words telling him that he will not be like Alfred and will be a good father. He finds Lizzie at the mansion and makes her level with him about him being the baby's father. He starts to leave and Lizzie tells him he has to make an honest woman out of her. Alan, standing in hunting gear and holding a gun, tells Jonathan he will do it his way or else. Jonathan goes back to Tammy and is dressed in a tuxedo, carrying a bridal bouquet. She thinks he is asking her to marry her and finally, after seeing a very pregnant Lizzie standing behind Jonathan, realizes Jonathan is the baby's father. He tries to explain to Tammy and she throws him out. Time seems to pass by and Lizzie pitches a newborn baby into Jonathan's hands and tells him that he has to learn to catch a child when he falls. Jonathan, at Company's nursery, holds his son. Buzz tells him the child will grow to hate him. Alan and Beth dress Jonathan in \"Spaulding attire\" and tell him what they expect of him. Lizzie tells him it's not to bad being Mr. Lizzie Spaulding.",
        "Year pass and a very young boy asks his daddy who the pictures are. Jonathan is looking at the pictures of Henry Cooper Bradshaw and Tammy as they have made it big time. The little boy wants to play ball and Jonathan makes him cry telling him no. Lizzie gets mad. Jonathan starts drinking heavily. Years later, a graying and drunken Jonathan starts a fight with a teen. He ends up slapping him and as the teen leaves, he tells him, \"I'm sorry, Johnny\". Jonathan visits Reva and tells her that he has turned into Alfred. He receives a phone call from a doctor telling him that his son, Jonathan Randall, Jr., has been in a motorcycle accident. As he goes to the hospital, Lizzie screams that Jonathan is at fault for he never loved him. The doctor leads him to a body; the body of his dead son. Jonathan sobs heartbroken. Suddenly, Lizzie brings Jonathan back to reality. He tells her that no matter what type of screw up she is, the baby is Coop's. He returns to Tammy, kissing her and hears his last words to Lizzie, \"Yeah, the baby is all Coops' and I am not going to give you anymore trouble for we both have exactly what we want."

        "Reva: I hate the fact that you had to spend one day in the care of Alfred. But that doesn't mean you're doomed to repeat his mistakes-- just the opposite, Jonathan. You would never allow a child to feel unloved or unwanted. And that baby will be lucky to have you!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Hey, Lizzie. How was your Memorial Day?",
        "Lizzie: Jonathan, what do you want?",
        "Jonathan: I'm just checking in, on you and the baby.",
        "Lizzie: We're good-- great, actually. Coop is moving in. Is this where you lean on me, try to get me to testify again? Did you come back with more threats about trying to ruin my relationship with Coop?",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie...",
        "Lizzie: I can't lie under oath, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, now lying is a problem for you? You are jacking up my entire life!",
        "Lizzie: Oh, I'm ruining things for you? Like you have a life worth ruining.",
        "Jonathan: You want to play who the bigger screw-up is, Lizzie? I know.",
        "Lizzie: You know what, Jonathan? What? What do you know? Jonathan! Don't run away from me! Jonathan, what do you know?",
        "Jonathan: You're pregnant.",
        "Lizzie: That's the big news?",
        "Jonathan: And the kid is mine.",
        "Lizzie: No! No, no, no! Coop is...",
        "Jonathan: Coop is a sucker. He should have kicked you to the curb a long time ago.",
        "Lizzie: I'm not carrying your child.",
        "Jonathan: Reva heard you tell your mother!",
        "Lizzie: Okay. What are you going to do?",
        "Jonathan: You're not denying it? Oh. This is going to get out, you know.",
        "Lizzie: Ever heard of spin control? People only know what you let them know.",
        "Jonathan: No, not in this town.",
        "Lizzie: No. Jonathan....",
        "Jonathan: Look, I mean, this baby could look like me, or when it gets older, what if it needs a kidney transplant and Coop doesn't match up? This isn't something you can hide. Someone's going to find out. If I tell Tammy now, maybe we can move past it.",
        "Lizzie: Forget that! She's never going to forgive you when she finds out. It will be over, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: No. Tammy and I are stronger than you know. I can tell her, and she'll handle it.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, can she handle me hounding you day and night to marry me?",
        "Jonathan: I am not marrying you.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, really? I'm sorry, do I look like some guy's baby mama? My family is not going to rest until you make an honest woman out of me.",
        "Alan: She's right. Elizabeth asked you to think, boy. I suggest you do that.",
        "Lizzie: Oh goody! It's groom hunting season.",
        "Jonathan: Whoa. Is that thing loaded?",
        "Alan: You don't want to find out, now do ya? Now if you want to claim your child, I suggest you do whatever Elizabeth wants you to.",
        "Jonathan: Well, what if I don't want to? I'm going to do this my way.",
        "Alan: No. It's my way or the highway. Now say yes, or your head's going to be on my mantle. ( Trigger cocks ) Speak now, or forever rest in peace.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Wow! I thought we were just going to the movies.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy, I have to get married.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan, I want that too!",
        "Jonathan: Uh, Tammy, wait...",
        "Tammy: I thought you were just scared, that you wanted to make sure that everything was perfect.",
        "Jonathan: I did. I do.",
        "Tammy: There's no such thing as perfect. We are what we are, and that's more than enough for me. Who cares if it's sudden, right? I don't need a big wedding. I don't need a ring or any of that. I just... all I need is you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: There he is. I know, it is beautiful, isn't it? I never thought that I would find a bridal shop to give me a dress that covers this. But they did, and here I am. Oh, those. Thanks. He told you, right?",
        "Tammy: Told me? Told me... oh, my God.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy...",
        "Tammy: Why, Jonathan? Why?",
        "Jonathan: I am so sorry. That baby is mine.",
        "Tammy: What are you telling me?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, wow. You didn't tell her? Oh, well. I need you for pictures.",
        "Jonathan: Give me a minute.",
        "Lizzie: All right, you know what? Make it snappy, okay? This kid waits for no one. I've got to toss this bouquet before I pop the kid out.",
        "Tammy: This is a joke. You are going to tell me that she is carrying Coop's baby! Oh, God...",
        "Jonathan: Tammy.",
        "Tammy: Don't touch me.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy, Tammy. I have to do what's right for the kid. I have to do what's right.",
        "Tammy: How about not sleeping with Lizzie in the first place? You think that might have been the right thing to do?",
        "Jonathan: I know, I know. But the Spaulding's are going to make my life miserable if I don't...",
        "Tammy: The way I feel right now, this is familiar.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy...",
        "Tammy: The last time you humiliated me, I thought it would never happen again. And I didn't even love you back then, the way that I do now.",
        "Jonathan: Look, we will find a way to make this work. I promise you.",
        "Tammy: What even makes you think that I want to make things work?",
        "Jonathan: I love you. I love you. You have to know that. Come on. Come on. I love you. Come here.",
        "Tammy: I know. No. No, Jonathan! I am done with you, with us! It's over! It's over!",
        "Jonathan: Come on, let me work this out. Please! Please forgive me, Tammy. You're the only thing I want in my life.",
        "Tammy: I stood up for you when no one else would. I was wrong. You know what? My mom was right: Once a dog, always a dog. I hope you and Lizzie have a miserable life together. I hope you hate yourself. I hope you hate who you are forever.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy! Hey! Tammy!",
        "Lizzie: Heads up! First lesson of fatherhood.",
        "Jonathan: What are you, crazy?",
        "Lizzie: Always be there for your children, catch them when they fall.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: I'm going to do good by you. It's going to be different than it was with my dad.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, yeah. Nate, right? I hear that didn't go so well-- you know, since you killed him.",
        "Jonathan: Well, I want it to be different with him.",
        "Lizzie: Well, then do something about it.",
        "Jonathan: Like what?",
        "Lizzie: I don't know.",
        "Buzz: No one will confuse me for someone who raised kids from the cradle, but I say keep it simple, you know. Love it, feed it, clothe it, change its diapers.",
        "Jonathan: And then what?",
        "Buzz: Sorry, pal. You know, he's probably going to grow up to hate you, especially if he knows you hate him for what he cost you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: I don't hate him.",
        "Alan: Hello, sweetheart! Up and at 'em, boy! Wait a minute here. This is not standard Spaulding dress. No. Why don't you try this on for size? Let's see here. That's more like it. And the hangman's noose.",
        "Jonathan: What do you guys expect from me? What do you think I'm going to do at Spaulding?",
        "Alan: I expect you to show up at the office and not burn down the building. You think you can handle that?",
        "Beth: And remember, you're a father now. It's not about what you want.",
        "Jonathan: No, it's about what you guys want.",
        "Alan: Stop your whining and enjoy the perks.",
        "Beth: A brand-new sports car.",
        "Lizzie: See? Being Mr. Lizzie Spaulding, it's not all that bad.",
        "Alan: And I expect you at the office Monday through Friday.",
        "Beth: And the Country Club on Saturday.",
        "Lizzie: Ooh, and brunch with the family on Sunday.",
        "Alan: And I will be keeping a watch on the mileage, so don't go anywhere you're not supposed to and we don't have any problems. You understand?",
        "Jonathan: So what you mean is, no freedom.",
        "Alan: All right, have it your way. No freedom. ( Laughter ) No freedom. No freedom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: You're going to wear a hole in the ground.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, well, I'm in training for when I run screaming the hell out of here.",
        "Reva: I am so proud of you, you know that? I mean, here you are trying... I know this is all very overwhelming for you, but you're doing a good job.",
        "Jonathan: Really?",
        "Reva: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jonathan: Doesn't feel like it.",
        "Reva: Trust in yourself. You have a son now, and with that comes the chance to really do something good with your life.",
        "Jonathan: Nothing good is going to come of this if this kid turns out like me. Mom, I really feel like I'm going to mess this one up.",
        "Reva: Let him in, Jonathan. If you do that, he'll teach you just as much as you can teach him.",
        "Jonathan: Why do I feel like the things that you learned from me are probably illegal in most states?",
        "Reva: You know what, I'm still learning from you. I am, watching you with your son, trying, even though I know this is the last place in the world you want to be.",
        "Jonathan: I can't give him up, though. Tammy's gone. He's the only thing I've got.",
        "Reva: Then hold on to him.",
        "Jonathan: And be the kind of dad I wish I had?",
        "Reva: Mm-hmm. ( Baby crying )",
        "Jonathan: Great.",
        "Reva: Whoa, that's quite a set of lungs on that kid!",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Shh, okay. That's enough out of you little man. Isn't this the part where you tell me everything's going to get better? That I'm going to get better at the daddy thing, and then Tammy's going to come back to me?",
        "Reva: I know there's no love in your marriage, and that you still hold out hope for Tammy, but don't.",
        "Jonathan: That hope is the only thing I have.",
        "Reva: She's with Coop now.",
        "Jonathan: Coop? Is it serious?",
        "Reva: She's moving to England with him. ( Baby crying )",

        "Young Johnny: Daddy, who's Henry?",
        "Jonathan: Just eat your cereal.",
        "Young Johnny: Why can't I see the paper? What's it say?",
        "Jonathan: I already told you, it's nothing.",
        "Lizzie: What is going on? Why are you letting him eat that?",
        "Jonathan: Because he told me he wanted a snack, so I made him one.",
        "Lizzie: And spoiled his dinner.",
        "Jonathan: Would you stop? You come in here, you just right away, getting on me.",
        "Young Johnny: Can we play catch, Daddy?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, not in the house, honey. Go outside and play with him, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: I'm busy.",
        "Lizzie: Doing what? Reading the paper?",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie...",
        "Young Johnny: Daddy, would you teach me how to throw? Sam's dad taught him how to throw.",
        "Jonathan: Well, I'm not Sam's Dad. And if there's something you want to learn, you teach it to yourself, because that's how you survive in this world.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, could you just turn the grumpiness off for one minute and teach your son how to throw a football?",
        "Young Johnny: Please, Daddy?",
        "Jonathan: I take orders from Spaulding's all day. Don't you start in now, too.",
        "Lizzie: Jonathan...",
        "Jonathan: There you go. Go! Go!",
        "( Crying )",
        "Lizzie: What is wrong with you? Can't you see how much he loves you?",
        "Jonathan: Of course I can! You spoiled little brat! I have given up everything for that kid. I live here, I work for your family. I kiss Alan's ring all day long. Watching him run around on the field trying to win trophies, that is not me. That's not me. Wait, wait! Wait. Stop! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Look, we just don't spend enough time alone together.",
        "Lizzie: No, we don't.",
        "Jonathan: Okay, I want to make this as good as it can be. I want to make it work.",
        "Tammy: I want you, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy...",
        "Lizzie: What did you say to me? It has been six years. Get over her! She doesn't want to have anything to do with you.",
        "Jonathan: What do you know about it?",
        "Lizzie: I had things all set up so that Coop would be the father. I was lying my butt off, and it was working.",
        "Jonathan: I was trying to do the right thing.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, yeah, that's great. That's great, Jonathan. Look where it got us. You made this mess, and you live with it. And don't ever yell at our son like that again.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, Tammy, it's me. I need to talk to you. I know it's been a really long time, but I really need to talk to you.",
        "Young Johnny: I did it, Dad. I taught myself how to throw.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, you did. That's uh... that's good.",
        "Young Johnny: We can play catch now.",
        "Jonathan: You go. You go play.",

        "Jonathan: You're late.",
        "Teen Johnny: So?",
        "Jonathan: Where have you been?",
        "Teen Johnny: Out. Yeah, that's right. Check the right pocket. That's where I keep my rubbers, cigarettes, and drugs. I'm not doing anything wrong. I wouldn't want to disappoint mom.",
        "Jonathan: Ouch.",
        "Teen Johnny: Why are you always waiting around for me? Why don't you go drink your beer, or stare at the walls, or finger through your stash of old pictures of that girl you used to know.",
        "Jonathan: What?",
        "Teen Johnny: Nothing.",
        "Jonathan: It better be nothing. You better watch your mouth about what you don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Teen Johnny: So mom had a bunch of cute friends back in the day. I'm just saying that...",
        "Jonathan: You should be saying nothing. That's what you were saying when you first came in-- nothing, right?",
        "Teen Johnny: Whatever.",
        "Jonathan: You know who you're dealing with?",
        "Teen Johnny: The guy who gets paid to be married to mom.",
        "Jonathan: Wow. You're really feeling it tonight. You want to do this with me?",
        "Teen Johnny: I'm not afraid of you.",
        "Jonathan: No?",
        "Girl: Hey, baby. So, this is the dad?",
        "Jonathan: Excuse us. What is that? What happened to Melissa?",
        "Teen Johnny: She's \"too nice\" girl. She's always studying or hanging out with her boring family.",
        "Jonathan: You trade a good girl in for a girl who's more comfortable on her back? I don't want to see you make the same mistakes I made.",
        "Teen Johnny: Like me? I'm the mistake, right?",
        "Jonathan: No, no. Johnny, no, I didn't mean that you were a mistake.",
        "Teen Johnny: And why don't I believe that?",
        "Lizzie: Hi, honey. How... what is that about? Why is it that every time I find the two of you together, Johnny leaves looking like that? Oh, no, no. You've gone out every night this week. They're already starting to talk about us at the Country Club.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, no, not that.",
        "Lizzie: It's not always about you.",
        "Jonathan: It's always been about Tammy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: So have you heard anything?",
        "Cassie: She started teaching. An all-girls school outside London. Coop's still teaching, too.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah?",
        "Cassie: There's a postcard from her right there. She said she's learning how to ride.",
        "Jonathan: She hated the horses when she was here.",
        "Cassie: Well, I guess she's getting pretty good now. I remember how spooked she was when Jeffrey got thrown that one Valentine's Day. You remember? Of course, he deserved it, I'm sure.",
        "Jonathan: Wow, that was like... that was like 16 years ago.",
        "Cassie: Long time.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: You know, I don't think I believed that you really loved her. But here you are, still coming around.",
        "Jonathan: Yep. I tell you, sometimes when I'm here, I feel like she could just, you know, walk through the front door. I still pray a little bit that she does, but...",
        "Cassie: I miss her, too. How's... how's Johnny?",
        "Jonathan: He's a good kid. He's... you know, I come down too hard on him. I just can't help it sometimes when I look at him. I'm reminded of...",
        "Cassie: Of yourself?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. And other stuff.",
        "Cassie: How many of those have you already had today?",
        "Jonathan: Including the one that you gave me?",
        "Cassie: I'm only asking because I care.",
        "Jonathan: Well, I've got to go anyway, before the S-patrol puts out an APB on me.",
        "Cassie: Jonathan?",
        "Jonathan: I'm sorry.",
        "Cassie: She's coming home.",
        "Jonathan: When?",
        "Cassie: Tonight. Do you want to come by, maybe for dinner?",
        "Jonathan: No, no, I can't. I can't. I'm going to... I'm going to head back to the mansion, but... good to see you.",
        "Jonathan: I can't do this anymore. Tammy. Been a long time.",
        "Tammy: Years.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Long years.",
        "Tammy: So, how have you been?",
        "Jonathan: Uh... you know. I haven't left Springfield, if that tells you anything. You are still the most beautiful girl to ever come in this place.",
        "Tammy: Girl. It's been a long time since I've been one of those. I'm more used to wife and mother these days. So how's Lizzie?",
        "Jonathan: You know, Lizzie's Lizzie. It's not ever been...",
        "Tammy: I hope not. We're way too old for that kind of craziness.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Tammy: I mean, you and I could never catch a break. It was always crazy, emotions flying everywhere. As long as I was with you, life never did seem bad. It was actually pretty exciting.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, it was.",
        "Tammy: You always made me feel like everything would be okay.",
        "Jonathan: I... I think about it a lot.",
        "Tammy: You do?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. I think about what we had, and what could have been.",
        "Tammy: I remember it all. That time they caught us in the barn, or when we broke into the department store and hung out in the Christmas display.",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughing ) Yeah.",
        "Tammy: Or that bar you used to own.",
        "Jonathan: Well, you be careful, because that was also our home.",
        "Tammy: I'm the one who put us there, remember? Did we ever come out of that back room?",
        "Jonathan: Only to make more trouble.",
        "Tammy: I never said anything, but I always hated having my clothes smell like beer.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. You know, when you left, I knew the best part of my life was over.",
        "Tammy: When you married Lizzie, something died inside me. I thought I was literally going to die. Young love, so dramatic.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah.",
        "Coop: Oh, this old place hasn't changed a bit. Johnny, how have you been?",
        "Jonathan: Coop.",
        "Coop: Let me guess, has my girl here been boring you with British tales of our stuffy lifestyle?",
        "Jonathan: No. No, actually, we were just catching up. Don't worry.",
        "Coop: Oh, I don't.",
        "Tammy: We've been traveling all day. I should go and freshen up. It's good to see you, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: It's good to see you too, Tammy.",
        "Coop: So, you're still with Lizzie. I know that certainly can't be too easy. Tell me, how's your boy?",
        "Jonathan: He's fine.",
        "Coop: Well, I must say, I didn't think you'd hang in there, but...",
        "Jonathan: But I did.",
        "Coop: Yes. I was going to say that you did. Good man.",
        "Jonathan: Thank you, Henry.",
        "Coop: Just think, that could have been my life. Ah.",
        "Jonathan: Could've been. I can afford it. Look around.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: You smell like a warthog. I am not going to do this again. I'm not going to do this again. You get him help.",
        "Lizzie: What, he had a few too many drinks to drive. That makes you better than us?",
        "Buzz: You're welcome! Do not let him come back to my restaurant until Tammy and Coop leave.",
        "Lizzie: You saw Tammy? The love of my life is in town, too. You don't see me getting sloppy drunk.",
        "Jonathan: Too bad for you.",
        "Lizzie: You ruined things for everyone, Jonathan-- for me and Coop, for you and Tammy. And now you're ruining the life of the child that you say you did it all for. Your son hates you.",
        "Jonathan: He's going to realize one day that it was all for his own good!",
        "Teen Johnny: Well, sounds like whatever you do, it's always messed up.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, don't you walk away from me. Hey! It's a school night. Where you think you're going?",
        "Teen Johnny: Leave me alone.",
        "Jonathan: I did not raise some spoiled brat party boy. You are going to do something with your life.",
        "Teen Johnny: Yeah, I'll get right on that. I'm out of here.",
        "Jonathan: Hey! You go when I say you go. You do what I say you do!",
        "Teen Johnny: Get real! You're not even the man of this house! Great-grandpa Alan is. And at least he loves me.",
        "Jonathan: What do you know about love?",
        "Teen Johnny: What do you know about it? You spit on anything and everything you can.",
        "Jonathan: Don't you disrespect me. I gave up my life for you.",
        "Teen Johnny: You didn't give up your life. You just gave up, period. Nobody wants you here. Everyone in Springfield hates you. Do us all a favor and go drink yourself to death.",
        "Jonathan: Johnny... Johnny...",
        "Teen Johnny: Get away from me! Don't act like you haven't wanted to do that your whole life!",
        "Jonathan: Johnny. I didn't mean to. Johnny, relax.",
        "Teen Johnny: Whatever.",
        "Jonathan: Johnny! Hey, Johnny! Johnny!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: I'm him. I swore to myself I was never going to become my father. I tried over and over. I told myself, don't do it, don't give in, and then I didn't know how. I didn't know what to do. I've seen this coming my whole life. I've watched myself try and be something different, and then... I just don't know how.",
        "Reva: Let me get some ice for your hand.",
        "Jonathan: I don't care about my hand! If I could, I would cut it off to remind myself I made a promise, remember? I was going to be the kind of father I never had. Instead, I turn into Alfred.",
        "Reva: You tried harder, Jonathan, than he ever did.",
        "Jonathan: And what good did it do me? I should have seen this coming. Do you remember that day in Company, when he was just a baby? You had so much hope for me. I held him, even then, in my arms. I looked at that kid and I said, \"This is your fault.\"",
        "Reva: You were so young, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: But that feeling took hold. I blame Johnny for my decision, a decision that I've always regretted.",
        "Reva: You got trapped into a life that you never wanted, and we both know why.",
        "Jonathan: Why? Why? Because I did the right thing? Let's just acknowledge that for the B.S. that it is, because we both know I was never the right thing for that kid.",
        "Reva: He's just going through a phase. It'll pass.",
        "Jonathan: You know, he could have had a decent life with Coop as his father, if I'd have just been selfish and lied. That's what Lizzie wanted. That's what I really wanted.",
        "Reva: Well, you just have to love him more, the way I did when you first came to town. Remember how you kept trying to push me away, and I said, \"No, I will love you.\"",
        "Jonathan: I hated you so much.",
        "Reva: You hated the world.",
        "Jonathan: I hit him, Reva. I hit him. Johnny and I shouldn't even be in the same house. It's not safe.",
        "Reva: You just have to love him more. You have to want the love more than the anger.",
        "Jonathan: You know, I dreamed about the kind of father I would be. But I always thought that Tammy would be there with me.",
        "Reva: Well, she's not. And she never will be. But you still have a child.",
        "Jonathan: I know. But he is so angry and so upset, and I taught him that. Why couldn't I teach him to be someone better?",
        "Reva: You can.",
        "Jonathan: I just never really tried. That poor kid. I never really tried. That changes now. I'm his father. I will do what I have to do to save him.",
        "Reva: Yes.",
        "Jonathan: I will. I will do that, Mom. ( Phone rings )",
        "Reva: Maybe that's Johnny.",
        "Jonathan: Johnny?",
        "Dr. Brown: Jonathan Randall?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah?",
        "Dr. Brown: This is Dr. Brown calling from Cedars. You're the father of Jonathan Randall, Jr.?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, why?",
        "Dr. Brown: Your son has been in a motorcycle accident. You need to get down here as fast as possible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Where is he?",
        "Lizzie: This is your fault! You did this!",
        "Jonathan: Where is he?",
        "Lizzie: You did this! You never loved him enough! All you ever did was reject him! This is your fault!",
        "Reva: Stop it.",
        "Lizzie: No! ( Crying ) No! No!",
        "Jonathan: ( Crying )",
        "Lizzie: You did this! This is your fault! No! No! ( Sobbing )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Jonathan? Jonathan? What? What do you know, Jonathan?",
        "Jonathan: What?",
        "Lizzie: What?",
        "Jonathan: Nothing.",
        "Lizzie: What is wrong with you? Are you okay? You just spaced out.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, what were you talking about? What do you know?",
        "Jonathan: Reguardless of whatever kind of screw-up you are, Coop's going to make a great father.",
        "Lizzie: Of course he is. It's Coop's baby.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. It's all his. And I'm not going to give you any more trouble, because we both have exactly what we want. What anybody has to say, say it's our time...",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Alan-Michael: And when I do take my revenge-- and I will-- I intend to enjoy every minute.",
        "Mallet: Who the heck is after you?",
        "Dinah: I'm pumping the brakes and nothing's happening. It's like they're not working.",
        "Cassie: I am trying to help you.",
        "Josh: Well, that's a good thing, because I need you.",
        "Cassie: I'm here looking for my sister, Reva Lewis. Have you seen her, by any chance?"
