        "Jeffrey: All right, we've got some java.\r\n",
        "Harley: Listen, we've got a problem. \r\n",
        "Jeffrey: What? ",
        "\r\nHarley: Gus went straight back to work. He's out on the street right now trying \r\nto make contact with that drug dealer. ",
        "Jeffrey: So why is that a problem? \r\n",
        "Harley: Why? ",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. ",
        "\r\nHarley: Because he just said good-bye to his sister forever. He\u2019s... he's \r\nfreaked out. The last thing anybody undercover should be is freaked out. \r\n",
        "Jeffrey: Take it easy. No, I disagree. The \r\nstreet is exactly where Gus needs to be right now. ",
        "Harley: No, I disagree. He's not 100%, \r\nJeffrey. He could get into trouble out there. ",
        "\r\nJeffrey: Vinnie Salerno just lost $5 million of his top selling drug. His \r\ndealers are going to be screaming for product, okay. Now we've mounted the \r\npressure on Salerno, which means he's likely to slip up, make a mistake. That's \r\nwhat we want, and that's why it's good to have Gus out on the street. \r\n",
        "Harley: Okay, but in his current state of \r\nmind... ",
        "Jeffrey: Gus is a big boy, Harley, okay. He \r\ncan take care of himself. I suggest that we worry about our work. ",
        "\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
        "Dealer: Hey. ",
        "Gus: Hey. ",
        "Dealer: (Laughs) I heard you were looking for \r\nme. ",
        "\r\nGus: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. You know the little dance we've been doing with each \r\nother for the last couple of weeks? Well, it's over, because I would like to \r\ntake our business to the next level, you know what I'm saying'? ",
        "Dealer: Well, it can't happen right now.\r\n",
        "Gus: That is the wrong answer my friend.\r\n",
        "\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
        "Tony: What am I going to do about it? I mean, \r\nDanny, come on. This is... ",
        "Danny: Tony, like it or not, my future is in \r\nyour hands. I need to know what to expect. ",
        "\r\nTony: You come to me and tell me you're working with O\u2019Neill to bring down our \r\nboss. What do you expect from me? ",
        "\r\nDanny: All I'm asking is that you're straight with me. Tony, you heard Vinnie. \r\nMichelle's in danger if he finds out that she knows something that could hurt \r\nhim... ",
        "\r\nTony: This is crazy. Do you realize that all this time you've been going around \r\nbehind my back, lying to my face, and now you have the audacity to ask me what \r\nI'm going to do about it? Danny... ",
        "Danny: Yeah? ",
        "Tony: Okay, fine. You know what? I'll tell \r\nyou exactly what I'm going to do about it: Nothing. Not a thing, all right?\r\n",
        "\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
        "Edmund: It was an accident, I assure you, an \r\nunfortunate mix- up. ",
        "\r\nSalerno: All I know is you were supposed to deliver me a package today from San \r\nCristobel and you don't have it. ",
        "Edmund: I was fully expecting delivery.\r\n",
        "Salerno: Well, maybe you weren't the only \r\none. Could be that item was seized. ",
        "Edmund: No, the seal was intact when I \r\nreceived it. It wasn't tampered with. ",
        "Salerno: Yeah, whatever, all right? We still \r\nhave a problem. I'm expecting a package. It's not here. ",
        "Edmund: Our deal can still go forward as \r\nplanned. I'll come over, explain everything to you. ",
        "Salerno: It's late. ",
        "Edmund: It's not too late to put things back \r\non track. I'll be right over, explain everything. ",
        "Cassie: Sounds important. Where are you \r\ngoing? we wish you ",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I'm sorry. I have to meet \r\nsomeone. ",
        "Cassie: Yeah, to put things back on track. I \r\nheard. ",
        "Edmund: Yes, and it is important, as you \r\nnoted. ",
        "Cassie: Official business? ",
        "\r\nEdmund: Ah, yes. Yes. That's exactly what it is, and I do really have to get \r\ngoing. I'm sorry, but hopefully it won't take too long. ",
        "Cassie: Well, duty calls, huh? ",
        "Edmund: Literally. ",
        "Cassie: Oh. This message from the castle. \r\nEdmund? Vinnie Salerno? ",
        "\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
        "Marina: Thank you. That walk was just what I \r\nneeded. ",
        "Shayne: I guess there's nothing like a \r\nrelaxing walk around the lake to get your mind off a funeral. ",
        "Marina: Almost off. ",
        "Shayne: So you ready to go back to the museum \r\nyet? Go visit Michelle first. ",
        "Shayne: Sweetie, you need to get some sleep.\r\n",
        "Marina: Well, it'll be good for her to have \r\npeople around talking to her, reminding her that's she's missed. ",
        "Shayne: All right, we need to try to make...\r\n",
        "Marina: Shayne, I can't possibly go to bed \r\nwithout finding something positive to end the day with. Come on. ",
        "\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
        "Danny: You're not going to tell Vinnie what I \r\ntold you? ",
        "Tony: No, I'm not. I'm not. ",
        "Danny: What about protecting your boss and \r\ngiving him a heads up when there's trouble? ",
        "Tony: Look, Danny... Danny, you asked me what \r\nI'm going to do about it and I told you, all right? ",
        "Danny: This is interesting. What happened to \r\nyour loyalty? ",
        "Tony: I am loyal to the organization. And \r\nyeah, Vinnie's the boss, but he's got me a little worried. ",
        "Danny: Why? ",
        "Tony: Because he's turning into a loose \r\ncannon, Danny. ",
        "Danny: How so? ",
        "\r\nTony: You know him. You do. He's emotional; he's superstitious; he's nuts, this \r\nguy. I mean, he's got a lot more power now that's he's in charge, and he's not \r\nusing it the way he should. ",
        "Danny: Which is? ",
        "\r\nTony: Running the business like a business. It's the way it's always been done \r\nin the past; it's the way it works best. You know that. Clean and simple, right? \r\nBut with Vinnie, it's like everything's personal. A deal falls through, \r\nsomebody's late on a payment-- to Vinnie those aren't just problems; they're \r\ninsults, Danny. I don't know. He runs the operation like it's all about him, and \r\nit's not good. ",
        "Danny: It weakens the organization. \r\n",
        "\r\nTony: Yes, it does. It weakens. You're right. I mean, that hit on Eden, it was \r\njust... I'm telling you, man, it's showing how out of control this is all \r\ngetting. He didn't have to do it, Danny. He didn\u2019t. I mean, he could have \r\ntrusted Eden enough to make sure she followed through on the deal. But, no, he \r\nwanted her dead, you know? And now, this is the worst part, Danny, right now. \r\nI'm telling you, now he's going to want Michelle dead. You understand that?\r\n",
        "Danny: Yeah. I'm not going to let that \r\nhappen. ",
        "\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
        "\r\nMarina: Thank you for being understanding about this. I just wouldn't feel right \r\nif I didn't see Michelle before we went home. ",
        "Shayne: Anything for you, baby. Anything.\r\n",
        "Sandy: How come you never say that to me?\r\n",
        "Shayne: Well, because you're not quite as \r\ncute. ",
        "Sandy: No argument there, brother. So, what's \r\nthe cozy couple up to tonight? ",
        "Marina: We're going to stop at the hospital \r\nto see Michelle. ",
        "Sandy: You're a good friend, marina. \r\n",
        "\r\nMarina: I just want her to wake up. Well, you should come with us. We could stop \r\nand get something to eat at company afterwards. ",
        "Sandy: Thanks, but I think I'll let you guys \r\noff the hook tonight. ",
        "Shayne: Off the hook? What are you talking \r\nabout? ",
        "Sandy: Well, the last thing you need is old \r\n\"third wheel\" sandy slowing you down. ",
        "\r\nMarina: Will you stop? I talked to him about setting him up with someone, and \r\nnow he thinks I'm trying to get rid of him. ",
        "\r\nSandy: And I'm deeply hurt. Kidding. Seriously, you guys go ahead. I, believe it \r\nor not, have other friends I can hang out with in this town if I feel the need \r\nfor company. ",
        "Shayne: For instance, who? ",
        "Sandy: Her. ",
        "\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
        "\r\nTony: I want to do this for the family, okay.\u00a0\u00a0 I want to do it for you. I want \r\nto do it for Michelle and Robbie. So, no, to answer your question, Vinnie\u2019s not \r\ngoing to find out what you're doing. Not from me. And if there's anything else \r\nyou need from me, you're going to let me know, right? ",
        "Danny: Tony, thank you. ",
        "Tony: You don't need to thank me, Danny. You \r\ndon\u2019t. Just know... Vinnie\u2019s the problem now, man. I'm telling you. ",
        "Danny: Yeah. ",
        "\r\nTony: Yeah, I mean, you told him that story about Michelle, right? But when she \r\ncomes out of this coma, she\u2019s... she\u2019s... ",
        "Danny: I had no choice, Tony. I had to \r\nprotect Michelle. ",
        "Tony: I know that. I do. I know that. You \r\nstill do. ",
        "Danny: Maybe we need to give him someone else \r\nto worry about. ",
        "Tony: Someone like O\u2019Neill? ",
        "Danny: Eden took the heat. I've been taking \r\nit. Now Michelle. Maybe it's his turn. ",
        "Tony: I couldn't agree more. ",
        "Danny: All right, let me think about it...\r\n",
        "Tony: Yeah. ",
        "Danny: ...And I'll get back to you. \r\n",
        "Tony: All right. ",
        "\r\nDanny: Honey, you just certainly had an earful. You rest, sweetie. I'll be back. \r\nAnd when you wake up, everything's to be okay again. Tony? ",
        "Tony: Yeah. ",
        "Danny: We're going to bring Vinnie down.\r\n",
        "Tony: I know that. That'd be good. That would \r\nbe good for all of us. (Sighs) ",
        "\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
        "\r\nGus: Listen, man, all I... all I've been trying to do is deal with you for weeks \r\nnow. For weeks. All I want to do is a serious buy and you keep putting me off. \r\nWhy do you do that? ",
        "Dealer: Let me go, man. ",
        "Gus: I have $500,000 burning a hole in my \r\npocket. I just want to know if you're in or you're out. ",
        "Dealer: $500,000? ",
        "Gus: $500,000. Do I stutter? ",
        "Dealer: Yeah. Yeah, man. Only I've just got a \r\nlittle inventory problem, all right? ",
        "Gus: You don't have stuff, do you? \r\n",
        "Dealer: Look, it's only temporary. Trust me.\r\n",
        "Gus: Trust you? Trust you? You're a drug \r\ndealer. ",
        "\r\nDrug dealer: Look, a major stash disappeared a week or so ago. That's the truth. \r\nLook, I want to do business with you. ",
        "Gus: If you want to do business with me, just \r\nhandle your little supply and demand problem, okay? ",
        "Dealer: All right, I'll get you what you \r\nneed. I swear. ",
        "Gus: You don't even have to swear. Just \r\ndeliver. ",
        "\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
        "\r\nJeffrey: I know that Gus is torn up over losing his sister, but I really don't \r\nthink we have anything to worry about with him being back out on the street.\r\n",
        "Harley: He's angry. He's emotional. He could \r\noverreact. ",
        "\r\nJeffrey: I'd even go so far to say it's the best thing for him. Work is like \r\ntherapy for the guy. You know that. His whole life is about putting the bad guys \r\naway and helping the good guys. Now, if what he's doing tonight can help put \r\nSalerno into Vailsburg, then he's going to feel a lot better about what happened \r\nwith his sister, that somehow the sacrifice was worth it. ",
        "\r\nHarley: You know the difference between you and me? I actually love that guy out \r\nthere. To you, he's just another operative. ",
        "Jeffrey: Do not try to change his mind about \r\nworking, okay? Because this is close. We are too close right now. ",
        "Harley: Yeah, that's the other thing I want \r\nto talk about. ",
        "Jeffrey: What? ",
        "Harley: We are close. Not to just nailing \r\nSalerno, but his suppliers, too-- which means our contact at Spaulding. \r\n",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that's a good thing isn't it?\r\n",
        "\r\nHarley: Okay. So do you really think that brad green is as far up the ladder at \r\nSpaulding as this thing goes? Or do you think... ",
        "Jeffrey: Or is the sky the limit? I don't \r\nknow. You know, that's what we're trying to find out here. ",
        "\r\nHarley: Gus thinks that Alan and Alexandra Spaulding are the only family that he \r\nhas left. Do you really believe he's just going to slap the cuffs on them, no \r\nquestions asked, if he finds out that they're supplying the mob with antimonious?\r\n",
        "\r\nJeffrey: I believe that he's a professional, okay? And I believe that you are \r\noverreacting. The point is, the man knows he has a job to do and he knows what \r\nthat job is. (Cell phone rings) O\u2019Neill. ",
        "Harley: Cooper. ",
        "Gus: I was just calling to check in. Tell \r\nyou... ",
        "Danny: It's Danny. I'm at Salerno's club.\r\n",
        "Gus: ...A heck of conversation probably about \r\nto go down at the social club. ",
        "Jeffrey: How's Michelle? ",
        "Harley: You made contact with your man?\r\n",
        "Danny: Vinnie came to the hospital. \r\n",
        "Gus: Let's call him my \"domino man.\" \r\n",
        "Danny: He thinks that Michelle knows \r\nsomething. I had to lie to him and tell him that she's never going to recover.\r\n",
        "Gus: I gave him a push. All you have to do \r\nnow is sit back and watch all of the rest of them go down. ",
        "Danny: So I need to get Vinnie to focus on \r\nsomething else. I wanted to be sure you were listening. ",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, yeah, I'm here. ",
        "Harley: That sounds good. That sounds good. \r\nAre you okay? ",
        "Gus: I'll be okay. ",
        "Danny: Got to go. ",
        "Gus: I'll be okay. I'm not going to let me \r\nfeelings get in the way of my job, you know. Thank you. Coop, thanks. \r\n",
        "Harley: Got to his guy on the street. He says \r\nthe pressure should hit Salerno soon. ",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that was Danny and he's going \r\nto see Salerno right now. ",
        "\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
        "Salerno: Hey, look who's here! ",
        "Danny: How are you doing, Vinnie? ",
        "Salerno: I'm surprised you're not at the \r\nhospital. ",
        "\r\nDanny: Yeah, I know, but sitting around hour after hour watching Michelle, \r\nknowing that she's never going to be the same again... ",
        "Salerno: I know. It's a terrible thing.\r\n",
        "Danny: I can't believe that there's no hope \r\nfor her. It's killing me. ",
        "Salerno: You've got to get your mind off of \r\nthings, Danny. ",
        "Danny: I know. I know. That's why I'm here. I \r\nneed to do something. I need to work. ",
        "\r\nSalerno: Maybe in a couple of weeks, I'll put you on numbers with Lugi, all \r\nright? In the meantime, just try to relax. ",
        "\r\nDanny: Vinnie, come on. Would you be able to relax if you knew that your wife \r\nwas going to be a vegetable for the rest of her life? Give me a break here. Let \r\nme get back to getting a hold of that antimonious that Eden flushed on you. Let \r\nme work on that. ",
        "Salerno: What is this with you, a pet \r\nproject? You wanted to go to San Cristobel to help with the delivery. \r\n",
        "Danny: Oh, yeah, you've got to be having \r\nsupply problems by now, right? ",
        "\r\nSalerno: I do. I do, and I can handle them. Just sit tight, Danny. I'll put you \r\nback to work when I think the time is right. Not before. ",
        "Danny: All right. All right. Yeah, okay, \r\nVinnie, whatever you say. ",
        "Salerno: Something else on your mind, Danny?\r\n",
        "Danny: Yeah, I think I screwed up. \r\n",
        "Salerno: About what? ",
        "Danny: Jeffrey O\u2019Neill. ",
        "Salerno: Something happen? ",
        "\r\nDanny: Remember when I came to you looking for a spot in your organization and \r\nyou offered to take out O\u2019Neill as a gesture of goodwill? ",
        "Salerno: And you talked me out of it. \r\n",
        "Danny: Yeah. That was my mistake. O\u2019Neill is \r\non the war path now that Eden\u2019s dead. ",
        "Salerno: He can't prove it was a hit, can he?\r\n",
        "\r\nDanny: No, no, no, no. I made sure of that. But I... I overheard him at the \r\nhospital talking to some cops and he's convinced that you had something to do \r\nwith Eden\u2019s death, and he is going to come after you with everything he's got. I \r\nthink you need to get to him first. ",
        "\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
        "Jeffrey: What the... ",
        "Marina: Has there been any change? \r\n",
        "Tony: Well, she... she woke up. ",
        "Marina: Michelle was awake? ",
        "Tony: For a little bit. She went back under. \r\nRick says it, kind of... it's common. Happens sometimes. ",
        "Marina: Well, was Danny here? ",
        "Tony: He was in fact here, yeah. ",
        "Shayne: That's great. I mean, if she woke up \r\nonce, she's probably going to do it again. ",
        "Tony: Well, we'll see. ",
        "Marina: Next time, when you wake up it'll be \r\nfor good. Now that's an order. ",
        "Tony: Well, I guess we're all... we're all \r\nhoping that she pulls through this okay. So... ",
        "Marina: Tony, would you mind if Shayne and I \r\nhad a couple of minutes alone with her? ",
        "\r\nTony: Nope. Not a problem. I'll be outside if you guys need me, too, okay?\u00a0 Hey, \r\nCassie, it seems like everybody's showing up. What's going on? ",
        "Cassie: Just here to see Michelle. \r\n",
        "Tony: You all right? ",
        "Cassie: No. But maybe you could help me.\r\n",
        "Tony: If I can. What's up? ",
        "Cassie: I want to know about Vinnie Salerno. \r\nWhat he's doing in this town, everything he's after. Everything. ",
        "\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
        "Marina: Coming up on \"Guiding Light.\" \r\n",
        "\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
        "Michelle: Looking for me? ",
        "\r\nJeffrey: You've got another problem, a very real problem closer to home. And \r\nthat's what I want to talk to you about. ",
        "Tony: Vinnie Salerno, huh? ",
        "Cassie: That's right. I want to know whatever \r\nyou could tell me about him. ",
        "Tony: What makes you think I would know \r\nanything, Cassie? ",
        "Cassie: There's a good bet that you do, Tony.\r\n",
        "Tony: I'm trying to figure out why you're so \r\ninterested in him all of a sudden. ",
        "Cassie: You've heard the rumors about Danny.\r\n",
        "Tony: Yeah, I have. ",
        "Cassie: Well, he's my friend. He's a good \r\nfriend, and I think I have a right to know if he's back in the mob. ",
        "Tony: Okay, so ask him yourself. ",
        "Cassie: I did. ",
        "Tony: And? ",
        "Cassie: Well, he didn't say yes, but he \r\ncouldn't say no. ",
        "Tony: All right, Cassie, you know what? \r\nWhatever it is or isn't going on, Danny can handle himself, all right? \r\n",
        "Cassie: Well, you're good in the non-answer \r\ndepartment yourself, Tony. ",
        "\r\nTony: All right, look, Cassie, I'm going to give you some advice, okay? Forget \r\nthe rumors, forget Salerno. You run your business, you raise your kids and \r\neverything's going to be fine, all right? ",
        "Cassie: Can you guarantee that? ",
        "Tony: I... ",
        "Cassie: Can you? ",
        "Tony: I don't know. ",
        "\r\nCassie: Because if Danny\u2019s connected to the mob again and I'm connected to danny, \r\nwhich I am through government loans that underwrote the fifth street project, \r\nthen I may have more on my hands to worry about then kids in a hotel. A lot \r\nmore. ",
        "Tony: Is there... is there something else \r\ngoing on here you're not telling me about, Cassie? Huh? ",
        "Cassie: No. No, I just want to know what I \r\nmay have to deal with. So tell me about Salerno. ",
        "Tony: You can't let it go, can you? Let it \r\ngo. ",
        "\r\nCassie: Just tell me how he operates. Just give me a general idea, okay? You \r\ndon't have to give me specifics, Tony. ",
        "Tony: Cassie, if I had any, I would, all \r\nright. ",
        "Cassie: Does he have any business partners?\r\n",
        "Tony: What does that mean, partners? \r\n",
        "\r\nCassie: Business partners in town, someone that he does legitimate business \r\nwith, you know, someone who was here before he came to town-- bankers, \r\nmerchants, government, employees, diplomats, maybe? ",
        "Tony: Ambassadors? ",
        "Cassie: Well, does he? ",
        "\r\nTony: Now, Cassie, listen to me. I'm going to tell you something, okay, and I \r\nneed you to hear me. I need you to believe me, all right? You're a lot better \r\noff not knowing. A lot better off. ",

        "Sandy: Why wouldn't I? ",
        "Lizzie: Oh, Shayne and marina thought you \r\nwere nuts. ",
        "Sandy: Uh, no, they didn\u2019t. ",
        "\r\nLizzie: Believe me, they did. Okay. So marina and Shayne and I used to be close \r\nat one point, but then I guess we kind of fell apart and they just avoided me.\r\n",
        "Sandy: You can change that if you want.\r\n",
        "Lizzie: Maybe, maybe not. But, I mean, I do \r\nhave other friends. I've got you, and I've got Tammy and Joey. ",
        "Sandy: Oh, yeah, you're their third wheel.\r\n",
        "Lizzie: Um, I don't think so. Joey and I have \r\na different relationship than Tammy and I do. ",
        "\r\nSandy: No offense, but Joey can't see straight when he's with Tammy. (Sighs) but \r\nhey, it's no big deal. I'm the odd man out when I'm with Shayne and marina. \r\nWe're our own three-pack. ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, and is that fun? ",
        "Sandy: Sometimes. ",
        "Lizzie: So, what are they doing that you \r\ndidn't want to be with them right now? ",
        "Sandy: Going to the hospital to see Michelle.\r\n",
        "Lizzie: Hello, that's like a waste of time. \r\nShe's in a coma. ",
        "Sandy: Hello? It helps coma patients to have \r\npeople around them and talking to them. ",
        "Lizzie: Really? Maybe I should go by there. \r\nYou think I should... that might be a good idea, right? ",
        "Sandy: Unless you're afraid of hospitals.\r\n",
        "Lizzie: No, not at all. I spent a lot of time \r\nthere when I was sick. ",
        "Sandy: For someone who talks a lot, you've \r\nnever talked about that. ",
        "\r\nLizzie: Well, I guess I just don't normally think about it. This is kind of like \r\nmy anniversary, so it's been on my mind lately. But, I mean, I don't mind \r\ntalking about it. I'm not hiding anything. Not like you anyway. ",
        "Sandy: My life's an open book. ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, sure. Sandy, you talk a lot, \r\nbut you always put the focus on the other person. ",
        "Sandy: Speaking of, how's that Spaulding \r\nsummer project idea coming along? ",
        "Lizzie: You're doing it again. ",
        "Sandy: Well, why don't we go to the outdoor \r\ncafe and work on your idea. ",
        "Lizzie: Only if you're buying. ",
        "Sandy: Well, as a matter of fact, I am. And \r\nif you're a good little girl, I'll tell you all my secrets. ",

        "Danny: I don't know exactly word for word, \r\nbut I do know that you're on his hit list now. ",
        "Salerno: How about that, huh? So he really \r\nthinks I'm the one who had Eden popped? ",
        "Danny: That's what I heard him telling the \r\ncops. ",
        "Salerno: What? ",
        "\r\nDanny: Vinnie, I really thought I had it right. I did. My take on O\u2019Neill... I \r\nwas sure that he wouldn't be able to cause us any trouble, but I was wrong.\r\n",
        "Salerno: It's unlike you to misjudge someone, \r\nDaniel. ",
        "Danny: Yeah, I know. I know. I guess I was \r\ntrying to, I don't know, make a good impression on you. ",
        "Salerno: What do you mean? ",
        "\r\nDanny: When I came onboard here I wanted you to think that I could handle \r\nanything and anybody, that I hadn't lost my chops. And so when you offered to \r\ntake O\u2019Neill, I said, \"no, I can handle him, maybe even use him.\" ",
        "Salerno: Now he's turning up the heat, huh?\r\n",
        "\r\nDanny: I don't know, Vinnie. He's acting like a real renegade. I'm sorry. I was \r\nwrong about him. But I want to make it up to you, you know, should you decide \r\nthat you want to make a statement or a move... ",
        "Harley: I don't believe this. ",
        "Salerno: I appreciate the offer, Danny.\r\n",
        "Jeffrey: It's really something, isn't it?\r\n",
        "Salerno: You've done good. ",
        "Danny: Vinnie, I don't know about that.\r\n",
        "\r\nSalerno: No, no, no, no. Look, look, look. You want to be seen as a \"can do\" \r\nguy. I don't hold that against you. I might have done the same thing myself way \r\nback when. Besides, thanks to you, I know I'm on O\u2019Neill\u2019s day planner. That \r\nmore than makes up for it. ",
        "Danny: All right. (Phone rings) well, thanks \r\nfor understanding, Vinnie. All right. ",
        "Salerno: Listen, I got to get this. \r\n",
        "Danny: All right. I'm going to take off. I'll \r\ncheck in with you later. ",
        "Salerno: Yeah. ",
        "Danny: Okay. See you guys. ",
        "Salerno: Yeah? ",
        "Jeffrey: Very smooth, Mr. Santos. ",
        "Harley: What? Why? ",
        "Salerno: What? ",
        "Jeffrey: The next act is about to begin.\r\n",
        "\r\nSalerno: Half a million? What are kidding me? I don't even have ten gram worth \r\nof the stuff lying around let alone 500. He'll have to wait. Well, what do you \r\nmean he won't wait? ",
        "Jeffrey: Temper, temper, Vinnie. It's just \r\nGus' dealer who wants to make a new deal. ",
        "\r\nSalerno: Look, it's not my fault the stuff is gone, all right. That was an \r\naccident. Don't you think I'm trying to get more? You've got to be... tell the \r\nguy to be patient. We've all got to be patient. Shut up with the excuses, all \r\nright. Shut up. You will not lose this guy, do you understand me? Tell him I \r\nwill get what he needs, whatever it takes. ",
        "\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
        "\r\nJeffrey: All right everything's in motion. I'll be very interested to see who \r\nVinnie Salerno calls now. ",
        "Harley: You mean at Spaulding. ",
        "\r\nJeffrey: Well, it's an emergency, so he's going to have to call somebody at the \r\ntop. So you better get cracking. Don't be afraid to use those contacts of yours, \r\nall right? ",
        "Harley: Yeah. Brad and Marie Green. Got it. \r\nFor the record, you better hope that the Salerno buck stops with Brad Green.\r\n",
        "\r\nJeffrey: Yeah, otherwise we'll both be selling beachfront property in Atlantis. \r\nGo. Okay, Vinnie, now what? (Knocking on door) another visitor. Busy night.\r\n",
        "Salerno: More good news? ",
        "Jeffrey: May I come in? ",
        "\r\nSalerno: You're here to make a pitch, make it. I don't have a lot of time, even \r\nfor a hot-shot ambassador like you. ",
        "Jeffrey: Slumming, Mr. Ambassador? \r\n",
        "\r\nJeffrey: What brings you to Salerno\u2019s house, Edmund? It's not like you to make \r\nhouse calls, especially not this kind of house. ",
        "Salerno: What are you moonlighting as an \r\namateur shrink now? ",
        "Edmund: No, I'm simply pointing out that you \r\nseem more disturbed than when we spoke before. ",
        "Salerno: Yeah, well, an associate just gave \r\nme very bad news, okay? Satisfied? ",
        "Edmund: Well, I'm sorry to hear that. \r\n",
        "Salerno: And on top of what you're telling me \r\nnow... ",
        "Edmund: Look, that's precisely why I'm here: \r\nTo let you know that all the news is bleak. ",
        "Salerno: So you're telling me the package is \r\ncoming through after all? ",
        "Edmund: No. But I will deliver. That's a \r\npromise. ",
        "Salerno: No, you promised it would be here \r\ntoday. ",
        "Edmund: I know. I did. I'm looking into the \r\nproblem. ",
        "Salerno: I don't care about that. I want the \r\nstuff. ",
        "Jeffrey: Package of stuff? ",
        "\r\nEdmund: I understand your frustration.\u00a0\u00a0 Believe me, I do. I share your \r\nfrustration. I can see how this mishap might strike you as a show of bad faith. \r\nBut, I promise you, the last thing I want to do is to hurt our relationship, to \r\nhurt our arrangement. ",
        "Jeffrey: What arrangement? Come on, Eddie, \r\nboy, give me more. ",
        "Salerno: It doesn't help it any. ",
        "Edmund: You don't want to cancel our business \r\nall together, do you? ",
        "Salerno: No. I don't want to do that just \r\nyet, anyway. But your timing couldn't have been lousier, my friend. ",
        "Jeffrey: This hasn't been a good day for you, \r\nhas it? ",
        "\r\nSalerno: I have been taking it in the teeth from every direction. I'm not in the \r\nmood for another disappointment, okay? Especially from someone who approached me \r\nto make a deal. ",
        "Jeffrey: A deal about what? Come on, let's \r\ngo. Keep talking. ",
        "Edmund: The package will be in the next \r\ndiplomatic pouch from San Cristobel. I promise you. ",
        "Salerno: (Laughs) here we go, huh? Round two \r\nwith the promises. ",
        "\r\nEdmund: Well, yes, but this time it's more a guarantee. I've made the calls and \r\neverything is going to go as planned. ",
        "Salerno: The package will go right through \r\ncustoms. ",
        "Edmund: Right through customs. I'll get it \r\nand drive it straight to you. And then... ",
        "Salerno: No, and then I will live up to my \r\nend of the bargain. Only then. ",
        "Edmund: Of course. ",
        "Jeffrey: What kind of deal have you two \r\ncooked up? ",
        "Edmund: So we're in agreement? ",
        "Salerno: Yeah. I think this could work out \r\nfor both of us. ",
        "Jeffrey: Excellent. Excellent. ",
        "Salerno: Thanks for coming. ",
        "Edmund: No, thank you. It's well worth the \r\ntrip. I'll be in touch. ",

        "\r\nMarina: So we were sitting that blah room and I thought who would want to open \r\ntheir eyes if all they'd be looking at is those bare walls? ",
        "Tony: Okay? ",
        "\r\nMarina: So, then it hit me. What if we get in touch with all Michelle friends \r\nand family and ask them to come up with mementos and pictures-- well, anything \r\nupbeat that reminds them of Michelle-- then we could plaster the walls with \r\nthem. ",
        "Shayne: When she wakes, it'll be the first \r\nthing she sees. ",
        "Marina: She'll literally be surrounded in \r\nlove the second she wakes up. ",

        "\r\nMarina: Tony, I know you're worried about Michelle, but miracles do happen. I \r\nmean, you could take that from Shayne, too. ",
        "Shayne: Believe that. ",
        "\r\nTony: Well, listen guys, thank you. Thank you for coming. I'm sure Michelle \r\nheard every word guys said. So listen, thank you, all right. ",

        "Tony: Okay. ",
        "Marina: What was that for? ",
        "Shayne: That was because you're incredible.\r\n",
        "Marina: Incredible sexy? Brilliant? Funny?\r\n",
        "\r\nShayne: Nobody has had a worse year than you and all you could think about is \r\nmaking sure everybody else is okay. ",
        "Marina: Shayne, I am no saint. I just try to \r\ntake what I've learned and put it out into the world. ",
        "Shayne: Yeah, well, I've learned something \r\nthis year, too. I've learned that I love you more than ever. ",
        "Marina: I'm really very luck. ",

        "Marina: I just hope some of that luck rubs \r\noff on Michelle and Danny. ",
        "\r\nTony: Hey, we need you to wake up, Michelle. You've got to come back home, okay? \r\nI really wish you would. It's not that simple, is it? If I were in charge, it \r\nwould be. If I were in charge, Michelle, this never would have happened. \r\n",

        "\r\nGus: Yeah, yeah. It's been a pretty good night, but, you know, I just... I don't \r\nknow, I rattled my little drug friend pretty good. Oh, did you talk to O\u2019Neill? \r\nDo you know if he called Salerno yet? ",
        "Harley: Yeah. Oh, yeah. Vinnie went \r\nballistic. ",

        "Harley: I realize that. ",
        "\r\nGus: No, if you realize that, then just... I mean, if Salerno\u2019s blowing up \r\nbecause of his drug supply, you know, who's he going to call? He's going to call \r\nsomebody on the Spaulding side of things. Isn't that right? ",
        "Harley: Exactly. ",

        "\r\nHarley: I'm sorry. I'm sorry to do this now. But you know what? Since it is just \r\nthe two of us, listen, we are either going to prove that Brad Greene is \r\nchanneling antimonious to the mob on his own, or we're going to prove that he \r\nhad help. ",
        "\r\nGus: Whether he's getting help from the top at Spaulding, somebody like \r\nAlexandra, maybe, or Alan Spaulding? ",

        "Gus: Well, I'm sorry, I don't think that's \r\ngoing to prove to be the case. ",

I've been watching him. \r\nYeah, he's my father, but I've been watching him, and if something was going on \r\nthere, I think that I would... I think that I'd be able to tell. No. When this \r\ncomes down, Salerno\u2019s contact at Spaulding is Brad Greene. That's the way it is, \r\nperiod, end of story.
