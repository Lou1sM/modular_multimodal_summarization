He's out on the street right now trying to make contact with that drug dealer. \nJeffrey: So why is that a problem? \nHarley: Why? \nJeffrey: Yeah. \nHarley: Because he just said good-bye to his sister forever. He\u2019s... he's freaked out. The last thing anybody undercover should be is freaked out. \nJeffrey: Take it easy. No, I disagree. The street is exactly where Gus needs to be right now. \nHarley: No, I disagree. He's not 100%, Jeffrey. He could get into trouble out there. \nJeffrey: Vinnie Salerno just lost $5 million of his top selling drug. His dealers are going to be screaming for product, okay. Now we've mounted the pressure on Salerno, which means he's likely to slip up, make a mistake. That's what we want, and that's why it's good to have Gus out on the street. \nHarley: Okay, but in his current state of mind... \nJeffrey: Gus is a big boy, Harley, okay. He can take care of himself. I suggest that we worry about our work. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDealer: Hey. \nGus: Hey. \nDealer: (Laughs) I heard you were looking for me. \nGus: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. You know the little dance we've been doing with each other for the last couple of weeks? Well, it's over, because I would like to take our business to the next level, you know what I'm saying'? \nDealer: Well, it can't happen right now.\nGus: That is the wrong answer my friend.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nTony: What am I going to do about it? I mean, Danny, come on. This is... \nDanny: Tony, like it or not, my future is in your hands. I need to know what to expect. \nTony: You come to me and tell me you're working with O\u2019Neill to bring down our boss. What do you expect from me? \nDanny: All I'm asking is that you're straight with me. Tony, you heard Vinnie. Michelle's in danger if he finds out that she knows something that could hurt him... \nTony: This is crazy. Do you realize that all this time you've been going around behind my back, lying to my face, and now you have the audacity to ask me what I'm going to do about it? Danny... \nDanny: Yeah? \nTony: Okay, fine. You know what? I'll tell you exactly what I'm going to do about it: Nothing. Not a thing, all right?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nEdmund: It was an accident, I assure you, an unfortunate mix- up. \nSalerno: All I know is you were supposed to deliver me a package today from San Cristobel and you don't have it. \nEdmund: I was fully expecting delivery.\nSalerno: Well, maybe you weren't the only one. Could be that item was seized. \nEdmund: No, the seal was intact when I received it. It wasn't tampered with. \nSalerno: Yeah, whatever, all right? We still have a problem. I'm expecting a package. It's not here. \nEdmund: Our deal can still go forward as planned. I'll come over, explain everything to you. \nSalerno: It's late. \nEdmund: It's not too late to put things back on track. I'll be right over, explain everything. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: Sounds important. Where are you going? we wish you \nEdmund: Cassie, I'm sorry. I have to meet someone. \nCassie: Yeah, to put things back on track. I heard. \nEdmund: Yes, and it is important, as you noted. \nCassie: Official business? \nEdmund: Ah, yes. Yes. That's exactly what it is, and I do really have to get going. I'm sorry, but hopefully it won't take too long. \nCassie: Well, duty calls, huh? \nEdmund: Literally. \nCassie: Oh. This message from the castle. Edmund? Vinnie Salerno? ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nMarina: Thank you. That walk was just what I needed. \nShayne: I guess there's nothing like a relaxing walk around the lake to get your mind off a funeral. \nMarina: Almost off. \nShayne: So you ready to go back to the museum yet? Go visit Michelle first. \nShayne: Sweetie, you need to get some sleep.\nMarina: Well, it'll be good for her to have people around talking to her, reminding her that's she's missed. \nShayne: All right, we need to try to make...\nMarina: Shayne, I can't possibly go to bed without finding something positive to end the day with. Come on. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDanny: You're not going to tell Vinnie what I told you? \nTony: No, I'm not. I'm not. \nDanny: What about protecting your boss and giving him a heads up when there's trouble? \nTony: Look, Danny... Danny, you asked me what I'm going to do about it and I told you, all right? \nDanny: This is interesting. What happened to your loyalty? \nTony: I am loyal to the organization. And yeah, Vinnie's the boss, but he's got me a little worried. \nDanny: Why? \nTony: Because he's turning into a loose cannon, Danny. \nDanny: How so? \nTony: You know him. You do. He's emotional; he's superstitious; he's nuts, this guy. I mean, he's got a lot more power now that's he's in charge, and he's not using it the way he should. \nDanny: Which is? \nTony: Running the business like a business. It's the way it's always been done in the past; it's the way it works best. You know that. Clean and simple, right? But with Vinnie, it's like everything's personal. A deal falls through, somebody's late on a payment-- to Vinnie those aren't just problems; they're insults, Danny. I don't know. He runs the operation like it's all about him, and it's not good. \nDanny: It weakens the organization. \nTony: Yes, it does. It weakens. You're right. I mean, that hit on Eden, it was just... I'm telling you, man, it's showing how out of control this is all getting. He didn't have to do it, Danny. He didn\u2019t. I mean, he could have trusted Eden enough to make sure she followed through on the deal. But, no, he wanted her dead, you know? And now, this is the worst part, Danny, right now. I'm telling you, now he's going to want Michelle dead. You understand that?\nDanny: Yeah. I'm not going to let that happen. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nMarina: Thank you for being understanding about this. I just wouldn't feel right if I didn't see Michelle before we went home. \nShayne: Anything for you, baby. Anything.\nSandy: How come you never say that to me?\nShayne: Well, because you're not quite as cute. \nSandy: No argument there, brother. So, what's the cozy couple up to tonight? \nMarina: We're going to stop at the hospital to see Michelle. \nSandy: You're a good friend, marina. \nMarina: I just want her to wake up. Well, you should come with us. We could stop and get something to eat at company afterwards. \nSandy: Thanks, but I think I'll let you guys off the hook tonight. \nShayne: Off the hook? What are you talking about? \nSandy: Well, the last thing you need is old \"third wheel\" sandy slowing you down. \nMarina: Will you stop? I talked to him about setting him up with someone, and now he thinks I'm trying to get rid of him. \nSandy: And I'm deeply hurt. Kidding. Seriously, you guys go ahead. I, believe it or not, have other friends I can hang out with in this town if I feel the need for company. \nShayne: For instance, who? \nSandy: Her. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nTony: I want to do this for the family, okay.\u00a0\u00a0 I want to do it for you. I want to do it for Michelle and Robbie. So, no, to answer your question, Vinnie\u2019s not going to find out what you're doing. Not from me. And if there's anything else you need from me, you're going to let me know, right? \nDanny: Tony, thank you. \nTony: You don't need to thank me, Danny. You don\u2019t. Just know... Vinnie\u2019s the problem now, man. I'm telling you. \nDanny: Yeah. \nTony: Yeah, I mean, you told him that story about Michelle, right? But when she comes out of this coma, she\u2019s... she\u2019s... \nDanny: I had no choice, Tony. I had to protect Michelle. \nTony: I know that. I do. I know that. You still do. \nDanny: Maybe we need to give him someone else to worry about. \nTony: Someone like O\u2019Neill? \nDanny: Eden took the heat. I've been taking it. Now Michelle. Maybe it's his turn. \nTony: I couldn't agree more. \nDanny: All right, let me think about it...\nTony: Yeah. \nDanny: ...And I'll get back to you. \nTony: All right. \nDanny: Honey, you just certainly had an earful. You rest, sweetie. I'll be back. And when you wake up, everything's to be okay again. Tony? \nTony: Yeah. \nDanny: We're going to bring Vinnie down.\nTony: I know that. That'd be good. That would be good for all of us. (Sighs) ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGus: Listen, man, all I... all I've been trying to do is deal with you for weeks now. For weeks. All I want to do is a serious buy and you keep putting me off. Why do you do that? \nDealer: Let me go, man. \nGus: I have $500,000 burning a hole in my pocket. I just want to know if you're in or you're out. \nDealer: $500,000? \nGus: $500,000. Do I stutter? \nDealer: Yeah. Yeah, man. Only I've just got a little inventory problem, all right? \nGus: You don't have stuff, do you? \nDealer: Look, it's only temporary. Trust me.\nGus: Trust you? Trust you? You're a drug dealer. \nDrug dealer: Look, a major stash disappeared a week or so ago. That's the truth. Look, I want to do business with you. \nGus: If you want to do business with me, just handle your little supply and demand problem, okay? \nDealer: All right, I'll get you what you need. I swear. \nGus: You don't even have to swear. Just deliver. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nJeffrey: I know that Gus is torn up over losing his sister, but I really don't think we have anything to worry about with him being back out on the street.\nHarley: He's angry. He's emotional. He could overreact. \nJeffrey: I'd even go so far to say it's the best thing for him. Work is like therapy for the guy. You know that. His whole life is about putting the bad guys away and helping the good guys. Now, if what he's doing tonight can help put Salerno into Vailsburg, then he's going to feel a lot better about what happened with his sister, that somehow the sacrifice was worth it. \nHarley: You know the difference between you and me? I actually love that guy out there. To you, he's just another operative. \nJeffrey: Do not try to change his mind about working, okay? Because this is close. We are too close right now. \nHarley: Yeah, that's the other thing I want to talk about. \nJeffrey: What? \nHarley: We are close. Not to just nailing Salerno, but his suppliers, too-- which means our contact at Spaulding. \nJeffrey: Well, that's a good thing isn't it?\nHarley: Okay. So do you really think that brad green is as far up the ladder at Spaulding as this thing goes? Or do you think... \nJeffrey: Or is the sky the limit? I don't know. You know, that's what we're trying to find out here. \nHarley: Gus thinks that Alan and Alexandra Spaulding are the only family that he has left. Do you really believe he's just going to slap the cuffs on them, no questions asked, if he finds out that they're supplying the mob with antimonious?\nJeffrey: I believe that he's a professional, okay? And I believe that you are overreacting. The point is, the man knows he has a job to do and he knows what that job is. (Cell phone rings) O\u2019Neill. \nHarley: Cooper. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: I was just calling to check in. Tell you... \nDanny: It's Danny. I'm at Salerno's club.\nGus: ...A heck of conversation probably about to go down at the social club. \nJeffrey: How's Michelle? \nHarley: You made contact with your man?\nDanny: Vinnie came to the hospital. \nGus: Let's call him my \"domino man.\" \nDanny: He thinks that Michelle knows something. I had to lie to him and tell him that she's never going to recover.\nGus: I gave him a push. All you have to do now is sit back and watch all of the rest of them go down. \nDanny: So I need to get Vinnie to focus on something else. I wanted to be sure you were listening. \nJeffrey: Yeah, yeah, I'm here. \nHarley: That sounds good. That sounds good. Are you okay? \nGus: I'll be okay. \nDanny: Got to go. \nGus: I'll be okay. I'm not going to let me feelings get in the way of my job, you know. Thank you. Coop, thanks. \nHarley: Got to his guy on the street. He says the pressure should hit Salerno soon. \nJeffrey: Well, that was Danny and he's going to see Salerno right now. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSalerno: Hey, look who's here! \nDanny: How are you doing, Vinnie? \nSalerno: I'm surprised you're not at the hospital. \nDanny: Yeah, I know, but sitting around hour after hour watching Michelle, knowing that she's never going to be the same again... \nSalerno: I know. It's a terrible thing.\nDanny: I can't believe that there's no hope for her. It's killing me. \nSalerno: You've got to get your mind off of things, Danny. \nDanny: I know. I know. That's why I'm here. I need to do something. I need to work. \nSalerno: Maybe in a couple of weeks, I'll put you on numbers with Lugi, all right? In the meantime, just try to relax. \nDanny: Vinnie, come on. Would you be able to relax if you knew that your wife was going to be a vegetable for the rest of her life? Give me a break here. Let me get back to getting a hold of that antimonious that Eden flushed on you. Let me work on that. \nSalerno: What is this with you, a pet project? You wanted to go to San Cristobel to help with the delivery. \nDanny: Oh, yeah, you've got to be having supply problems by now, right? \nSalerno: I do. I do, and I can handle them. Just sit tight, Danny. I'll put you back to work when I think the time is right. Not before. \nDanny: All right. All right. Yeah, okay, Vinnie, whatever you say. \nSalerno: Something else on your mind, Danny?\nDanny: Yeah, I think I screwed up. \nSalerno: About what? \nDanny: Jeffrey O\u2019Neill. \nSalerno: Something happen? \nDanny: Remember when I came to you looking for a spot in your organization and you offered to take out O\u2019Neill as a gesture of goodwill? \nSalerno: And you talked me out of it. \nDanny: Yeah. That was my mistake. O\u2019Neill is on the war path now that Eden\u2019s dead. \nSalerno: He can't prove it was a hit, can he?\nDanny: No, no, no, no. I made sure of that. But I... I overheard him at the hospital talking to some cops and he's convinced that you had something to do with Eden\u2019s death, and he is going to come after you with everything he's got. I think you need to get to him first. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nJeffrey: What the... ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marina: Has there been any change? \nTony: Well, she... she woke up. \nMarina: Michelle was awake? \nTony: For a little bit. She went back under. Rick says it, kind of... it's common. Happens sometimes. \nMarina: Well, was Danny here? \nTony: He was in fact here, yeah. \nShayne: That's great. I mean, if she woke up once, she's probably going to do it again. \nTony: Well, we'll see. \nMarina: Next time, when you wake up it'll be for good. Now that's an order. \nTony: Well, I guess we're all... we're all hoping that she pulls through this okay. So... \nMarina: Tony, would you mind if Shayne and I had a couple of minutes alone with her? \nTony: Nope. Not a problem.

I want to know whatever you could tell me about him. \nTony: What makes you think I would know anything, Cassie? \nCassie: There's a good bet that you do, Tony.\nTony: I'm trying to figure out why you're so interested in him all of a sudden. \nCassie: You've heard the rumors about Danny.\nTony: Yeah, I have. \nCassie: Well, he's my friend. He's a good friend, and I think I have a right to know if he's back in the mob. \nTony: Okay, so ask him yourself. \nCassie: I did. \nTony: And? \nCassie: Well, he didn't say yes, but he couldn't say no. \nTony: All right, Cassie, you know what? Whatever it is or isn't going on, Danny can handle himself, all right? \nCassie: Well, you're good in the non-answer department yourself, Tony. \nTony: All right, look, Cassie, I'm going to give you some advice, okay? Forget the rumors, forget Salerno. You run your business, you raise your kids and everything's going to be fine, all right? \nCassie: Can you guarantee that? \nTony: I... \nCassie: Can you? \nTony: I don't know. \nCassie: Because if Danny\u2019s connected to the mob again and I'm connected to danny, which I am through government loans that underwrote the fifth street project, then I may have more on my hands to worry about then kids in a hotel. A lot more. \nTony: Is there... is there something else going on here you're not telling me about, Cassie? Huh? \nCassie: No. No, I just want to know what I may have to deal with. So tell me about Salerno. \nTony: You can't let it go, can you? Let it go. \nCassie: Just tell me how he operates. Just give me a general idea, okay? You don't have to give me specifics, Tony. \nTony: Cassie, if I had any, I would, all right. \nCassie: Does he have any business partners?\nTony: What does that mean, partners? \nCassie: Business partners in town, someone that he does legitimate business with, you know, someone who was here before he came to town-- bankers, merchants, government, employees, diplomats, maybe? \nTony: Ambassadors? \nCassie: Well, does he? \nTony: Now, Cassie, listen to me. I'm going to tell you something, okay, and I need you to hear me. I need you to believe me, all right? You're a lot better off not knowing. A lot better off.

Okay. So marina and Shayne and I used to be close at one point, but then I guess we kind of fell apart and they just avoided me.\nSandy: You can change that if you want.\nLizzie: Maybe, maybe not. But, I mean, I do have other friends. I've got you, and I've got Tammy and Joey. \nSandy: Oh, yeah, you're their third wheel.\nLizzie: Um, I don't think so. Joey and I have a different relationship than Tammy and I do. \nSandy: No offense, but Joey can't see straight when he's with Tammy. (Sighs) but hey, it's no big deal. I'm the odd man out when I'm with Shayne and marina. We're our own three-pack. \nLizzie: Yeah, and is that fun? \nSandy: Sometimes. \nLizzie: So, what are they doing that you didn't want to be with them right now? \nSandy: Going to the hospital to see Michelle.\nLizzie: Hello, that's like a waste of time. She's in a coma. \nSandy: Hello? It helps coma patients to have people around them and talking to them. \nLizzie: Really? Maybe I should go by there. You think I should... that might be a good idea, right? \nSandy: Unless you're afraid of hospitals.\nLizzie: No, not at all. I spent a lot of time there when I was sick. \nSandy: For someone who talks a lot, you've never talked about that. \nLizzie: Well, I guess I just don't normally think about it. This is kind of like my anniversary, so it's been on my mind lately. But, I mean, I don't mind talking about it. I'm not hiding anything. Not like you anyway. \nSandy: My life's an open book. \nLizzie: Yeah, sure. Sandy, you talk a lot, but you always put the focus on the other person. \nSandy: Speaking of, how's that Spaulding summer project idea coming along? \nLizzie: You're doing it again. \nSandy: Well, why don't we go to the outdoor cafe and work on your idea. \nLizzie: Only if you're buying. \nSandy: Well, as a matter of fact, I am.

My take on O\u2019Neill... I was sure that he wouldn't be able to cause us any trouble, but I was wrong.\nSalerno: It's unlike you to misjudge someone, Daniel. \nDanny: Yeah, I know. I know. I guess I was trying to, I don't know, make a good impression on you. \nSalerno: What do you mean? \nDanny: When I came onboard here I wanted you to think that I could handle anything and anybody, that I hadn't lost my chops.

Keep talking. \nEdmund: The package will be in the next diplomatic pouch from San Cristobel. I promise you. \nSalerno: (Laughs) here we go, huh?

What if we get in touch with all Michelle friends and family and ask them to come up with mementos and pictures-- well, anything upbeat that reminds them of Michelle-- then we could plaster the walls with them. \nShayne: When she wakes, it'll be the first thing she sees. \nMarina: She'll literally be surrounded in love the second she wakes up. \nTony: Well, I think that\u2019s... I think it's a good idea. \nMarina: Tony, I know you're worried about Michelle, but miracles do happen. I mean, you could take that from Shayne, too. \nShayne: Believe that. \nTony: Well, listen guys, thank you. Thank you for coming. I'm sure Michelle heard every word guys said. So listen, thank you, all right. \nMarina: I'll try to stop by again tomorrow.\nTony: Okay. \nMarina: What was that for? \nShayne: That was because you're incredible.\nMarina: Incredible sexy? Brilliant? Funny?\nShayne: Nobody has had a worse year than you and all you could think about is making sure everybody else is okay. \nMarina: Shayne, I am no saint. I just try to take what I've learned and put it out into the world. \nShayne: Yeah, well, I've learned something this year, too. I've learned that I love you more than ever. \nMarina: I'm really very luck. \nShayne: I know. \nMarina: I just hope some of that luck rubs off on Michelle and Danny. \nTony: Hey, we need you to wake up, Michelle. You've got to come back home, okay? I really wish you would. It's not that simple, is it? If I were in charge, it would be. If I were in charge, Michelle, this never would have happened.

Hi. \nGus: What are you doing here? \nHarley: Um, looking for you. How are you?\nGus: Good. I'm good. I'm just waiting on my guy, that's all. \nHarley: That's why you're still in your old get-up? \nGus: Yeah, yeah. It's been a pretty good night, but, you know, I just... I don't know, I rattled my little drug friend pretty good. Oh, did you talk to O\u2019Neill? Do you know if he called Salerno yet? \nHarley: Yeah. Oh, yeah. Vinnie went ballistic. \nGus: Really? \nHarley: Just like you said. \nGus: Well, it\u2019s nice to be right once in awhile. \nHarley: Good. \nGus: Yeah. \nHarley: Then you can, you know, you can go home now. You can relax a little bit, take a shower. \nGus: (Laughs) why, are you going home? \nHarley: Uh, me? No, I've got to go to the office. I've got to pull out my files on the Greenes. \nGus: If it's good enough for you, I'm going to stay. If you're working, I'm working, as well. \nHarley: Okay, but after the night you've had, I think you need some down time. \nGus: Well, I don't think so. I'm fine. \nHarley: You've done your part. \nGus: I've done my part? \nHarley: You've done enough. \nGus: Why are you pushing me on this, okay? I lost my sister, but I'm not pulling apart at the seams here, okay? I don't need... down time is not what I need. I don't even like that expression. Just let me do my job. \nHarley: I realize that. \nGus: No, if you realize that, then just... I mean, if Salerno\u2019s blowing up because of his drug supply, you know, who's he going to call? He's going to call somebody on the Spaulding side of things. Isn't that right? \nHarley: Exactly. \nGus: Exactly. So? \nHarley: So... \nGus: So what? \nHarley: So, I'm wondering.... \nGus: What are you wondering? \nHarley: I'm wondering how you're going to handle it if you find out that Salerno\u2019s people on the Spaulding side are the Spaulding\u2019s. \nHarley: I'm sorry. I'm sorry to do this now. But you know what? Since it is just the two of us, listen, we are either going to prove that Brad Greene is channeling antimonious to the mob on his own, or we're going to prove that he had help. \nGus: Whether he's getting help from the top at Spaulding, somebody like Alexandra, maybe, or Alan Spaulding? \nHarley: Yes. \nGus: Yeah, well, really? I don't think that's the case. \nHarley: Then who else? Who else could ensure that his dirty little secret keeps running smoothly under the radar? Who else? \nGus: I'm sorry. I don't buy it. I don't buy it. \nHarley: Don't or won't? \nGus: You know something? I realize that you hate them. I realize that you hate Alan and Alexandra, okay. You've got your whole little anti-Spaulding thing going on in your head. \nHarley: Listen to me, that's not what this is. \nGus: No? \nHarley: I'm thinking logically. \nGus: Logically? \nHarley: This is no bias, I promise. \nGus: You think... oh, so logic is telling you that Alan or Alexandra is supplying antimonious to the mob. Do you hear yourself? \nHarley: Sweetie, I am saying that may prove to be the case. Yes. \nGus: Well, I'm sorry, I don't think that's going to prove to be the case. \nHarley: I hope it isn\u2019t. \nGus: Look, I'm not delusional, okay? I don't think that Alan Spaulding is the perfect human being. But I am also... I am also a cop. I've been watching him. Yeah, he's my father, but I've been watching him, and if something was going on there, I think that I would... I think that I'd be able to tell. No. When this comes down, Salerno\u2019s contact at Spaulding is Brad Greene. That's the way it is, period, end of story. And when that ax comes down, its Brad Greene that will be under it, trust me, not my family. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nMichelle: Looking for me? \nDanny: Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Honey....\nMichelle: Danny, I missed you so much. \nDanny: Me, too. Me, too. How... Michelle, how... how did this? \nMichelle: Rick said it was everyone talking to me that brought me out of the coma. And he said I'm going to recover completely. \nSalerno: You lied to me! \nDanny: No! (Gunshot) hey, honey. It's almost over, Michelle. Then it will be safe for you to come back. I promise.

I'm glad you're here. I really need to talk to you. \nJeffrey: You need to talk... well, I need to talk to you. \nCassie: Really? \nJeffrey: Yeah, but you go first.
