        "Reva: She's not answering. I hope she's okay. Alonzo sent those guys after Will. Who knows what he might do?",
        "Josh: Hopefully Cassie and Alonzo will work things out. I'm just glad you stopped him from taking the kid away.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, I'm glad I had backup.",
        "Josh: Nate. He's a good guy.",
        "Reva: Yes, he is.",
        "Josh: Except for that whole wanting you thing, of course.",
        "Reva: He's my boss.",
        "Josh: Reva, it's okay. It is. If the guy didn't have interest in you, he wouldn't have a pulse. Excuse me. Could I get some milk in here, please? Thank you.",
        "Reva: Oh, he has one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: Aren't you glad to see me, son? You're stunned, speechless. Come here. Come here.",
        "Jonathan: What are you doing here?",
        "Nate: Nice place you've got here. Not as nice as the Lewis compound, though.",
        "Jonathan: I like my privacy.",
        "Nate: Do you? You trying to get rid of me already? No time for your dear old dad?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: Hey, hey.",
        "Sebastian: I got your call, what's up?",
        "Blake: I can't find Josh and Reva and they took Will. Somebody took Cassie's kid.",
        "Sebastian: Who did?",
        "Blake: Alonzo's guys.",
        "Sebastian: Isn't that the kid's father?",
        "Blake: Oh, come on! This is Cassie's kid! Are you going to help me?",
        "Sebastian: Relax. Let me take care of it right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Where have you taken Cassie?! If Alonzo hurts her in any way...",
        "Dinah: Edmund, she's fine! She's fine! She's with Alonzo. She is settling the whole Will mess right now. But I tell you something, she is not thinking of us right now. She is not in this cell with no light and no air. I can't breathe!",
        "Edmund: This is not... this is not the way it's supposed to happen.",
        "Dinah: No it's not.",
        "Edmund: If Alonzo tells the truth, she's not going to understand why I did what I did.",
        "Dinah: Edmund, I want you to forget about your plan to be some hero to Cassie. And I want you to get us out of here before it's too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: What is going on? Why am I here? Hello?",
        "Jeffrey: Need some help?",
        "Cassie: Oh, Jeffrey.",
        "Cassie: What are you doing here?",
        "Jeffrey: I thought I could help.",
        "Cassie: The last time I saw you, you said that, um... that you were washing your hands of me and you weren't going to come in between me and Edmund again.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well I lied.",
        "Cassie: Thank you. Thank you so much.",
        "Jeffrey: Don't thank me just yet. I've got something to tell you. Apparently Will is on his way down here right now on a plane.",
        "Cassie: What? He's not supposed to...",
        "Jeffrey: Take it easy. He's fine and even a little excited to be coming down here to see his father.",
        "Cassie: He doesn't belong here, Jeffrey. We have to stop this.",
        "Jeffrey: That's why I'm here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Guard: Princess Cassie is safe and well. She's waiting with prince Alonzo.",
        "Edmund: Where? Where?",
        "Dinah: Edmund, stop it! Stop it. Stop worrying about Cassie. Worry about us, me and the fact that I am a pregnant woman stuck in a cell.",
        "Edmund: Dinah, one way or another I will get us out of here.",
        "Dinah: From what I've seen, you have about as much clout in here as I do. You know, this... this whole thing could be a plan, you know, to get rid of us for good. And then we're stuck in here and the baby is born on the floor of a cell. My god, is that what you want.",
        "Edmund: Come on, Dinah, that's never going to happen.",
        "Dinah: What are you talking about? You do not know what it's like to be in a jail.",
        "Edmund: Just calm down and think about the baby.",
        "Dinah: Calm down? You have never been sent into a cell and forgotten.",
        "Edmund: Cassie has not forgotten us!",
        "Dinah: You have got to wake up! She doesn't care. When she finds out what you've done, she's not going to want you or the baby. If she can get rid of me in the process, she's going to live happily ever after! Why did they let me out the first time?",
        "Edmund: Dinah, what are you talking about? It's not the same people, it's not the same situation.",
        "Dinah: No one's going to come looking for me, not my father, not my brother, nobody. It's going to be just like before. And if this baby wasn't inside of me, you couldn't care, either. You'd leave me for dead.",
        "Edmund: Dinah, stop. Stop this. Just stop it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: You're beautiful.",
        "Tammy: I don't know exactly what you meant by me being me, but... hi.",
        "Sandy: You were expecting...",
        "Tammy: Nobody.",
        "Sandy: Hmm. Didn't sound like that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: What are you doing here?",
        "Nate: What kind of dad would I be if I didn't come looking for my runaway boy?",
        "Jonathan: I didn't run away.",
        "Nate: You took off without saying a word. Not even good-bye. That... that hurt.",
        "Jonathan: What are you doing here?",
        "Nate: Well, it took me five minutes to figure out where you'd gone. Another five to confirm it. You came here to confront the mommy that deserted you.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. That's what I did.",
        "Nate: Yeah. But imagine how I felt when I found out that you were living the life, enjoying your privacy while the family that abandoned you got a free ticket and the one that raised you doesn't even get a postcard.",
        "Jonathan: I'm sorry. I was busy.",
        "Nate: Hmm. Too busy for the man that took you in and raised you? That went hungry to feed you? Too busy enjoying the good life to even think about sharing the wealth with your dear old dad? Well, shame on you.",
        "Jonathan: I sent you money whenever I could get my hands on it.",
        "Nate: A pittance.",
        "Jonathan: Well, I have a new job now so I'll have more money.",
        "Nate: Can't you hit your mom up for some cash? I'd say she owes you.",
        "Jonathan: No. I'm just getting to know Reva.",
        "Nate: Reva. Your drinking buddy. Your soul mate.",
        "Jonathan: I'm her son.",
        "Nate: No. No. Her son in name and blood only. You are my son. I'm the one that loves you, right?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Right.",
        "Nate: I always did my very best for you, John. I never turned my back on you, did I?",
        "Jonathan: No.",
        "Nate: No. Reva... to Reva you were an inconvenience. You still are. Some people don't understand what's really important. But you try so very hard with her, the little girl next door, don't you? She's your cousin, isn't she? Oh, yeah. I did my homework. I wanted to find out all about your long lost family. Johnny, when you first came here you... you really gave it to them. I was so proud. But you really could have handled it with the little girl better.",
        "Jonathan: You leave Tammy out of this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I wasn't expecting anyone. I was just practicing a pitch for some the Lewis clients. And trying to a new look.",
        "Sandy: Well, it looks good.",
        "Tammy: You didn't come over to talk construction business.",
        "Sandy: No, I came over for dinner and maybe some other things.",
        "Tammy: Like what?",
        "Sandy: Well, if you have to ask...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Look, just forget about Tammy, okay? She doesn't even have anything you want.",
        "Nate: You know what I want now, do you? You're a mind reader now, are you? That's better. What I want is fairly simple, and if you go along with my plan we both win, because I know we both want to see Reva pay for dumping you. But if you can't handle it, that's fine. I'll go after Reva myself, my own way.",
        "Jonathan: No. Listen, that's why I'm here, to make Reva pay for what she did to me as a kid. But I'm going to do it my way.",
        "Nate: That's my boy. Shh. We understand each other, huh? We always have.",
        "Jonathan: ( Crying )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Listen to me.",
        "Josh: Ow! Okay.",
        "Reva: You have clients coming in from out of town, right? Why don't you bring them over to Outskirts? The place has a lot of atmosphere.",
        "Josh: What are you talking about? Aren't you the one that wanted to find something that's your own, something just for you? You wanted a place where you could go and wouldn't have the eyes of Lewis gazing down upon you at all times, right?",
        "Reva: That is a bit dramatic.",
        "Josh: I'm serious, Reva. You wanted to find yourself a clubhouse, for lack of a better term, and you found one. The last thing I want you to do is feel guilty about that.",
        "Reva: Guilty? Who's guilty.",
        "Josh: You are.",
        "Reva: No, I'm not.",
        "Josh: Why are you suggesting I bring my clients to your bar?",
        "Reva: To help you out, maybe.",
        "Josh: I don't need your help and you don't need my help. Admit it, Reva. You declared your independence, right? Now you're feeling a twinge of guilt so you feel like you should throw me a bone.",
        "Reva: I do not.",
        "Josh: I'm not biting. Reva, I love your independence. I do. I love the fact that you want to strike out and do something on your own. But I also know what happens when I try to reign you in. Not good things. So why don't we stick to our plan, okay? Outskirts is your turf. What happens there stays there. Lewis construction, my turf. Deal? Whoa. Whoa.",
        "Reva: Sorry.",
        "Josh: It's just, you know, I...",
        "Reva: What?",
        "Josh: You know, you dream about stuff, about that kind of thing and then when it actually happens it's just kind of A...",
        "Reva: I'm sorry.",
        "Josh: Reva, I think I know every kiss that we've ever had together. That one, though, that felt a little more like a kiss-off.",
        "Reva: When have I ever, ever given you a kiss-off. I just gave you a great kiss.",
        "Josh: I know, you're a great kisser.",
        "Reva: I know. Maybe I'm distracted. I'm starting this big new life and Jonathan told me I was in a rut.",
        "Josh: Well if Jonathan said it, it must be true.",
        "Reva: Maybe I should thank him.",
        "Josh: Tell him I said hi.",
        "Reva: Right, I will.",
        "Josh: Wait. I'm all for this independent woman thing, but it doesn't mean I don't miss you.",
        "Reva: And I don't want you to ever, ever think that this new job is going to take me away from you.",
        "Josh: Okay. Same for me and for my new job.",
        "Reva: What new job?",
        "Josh: Well, I mean, you're not the only person around here who has new friends, Reva.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: I can't... I can't take much more of this. Look at this place.",
        "Edmund: Don't, don't look at this place, don't look at this place. Look at me. Look at me. Let's play some pretend, all right? Let's pretend we're somewhere else.",
        "Dinah: Pretend?",
        "Edmund: Yeah, pretend. Come on! Didn't you play pretend when you were little?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Yeah, of course I did. I pretended that I had a home and a father and a mother who loved me very much.",
        "Edmund: Well good! Good! Let's pretend we're somewhere else, all right? Let's go back to the ball, okay?",
        "Dinah: How?",
        "Edmund: Just... just look at me, all right? Look at me. Go back together, hear the music see... see the beautiful people. What did you like best about the ball?",
        "Dinah: Being with you. Having the people watch us be together.",
        "Edmund: Dinah, you were beautiful. You are beautiful. You're the most beautiful woman in the room.",
        "Dinah: Tell Cassie.",
        "Edmund: Don't think about Cassie. I'm not thinking about Cassie. I'm only thinking about you. Hey, you know what? We never had the opportunity to dance.",
        "Dinah: No.",
        "Edmund: Come on. Come on. Let's run with that, huh? Come on. Come with me. It's okay. I want to dance with you. It's okay. Come on.",
        "Dinah: Yeah. I can... I like this.",
        "Edmund: See? You do? How about this? You like that? How about this? ( Laughs ) oh, sorry, I got a big carried away. Are you all right?",
        "Dinah: Oh, Edmund, the baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Are you sure Will's okay?",
        "Jeffrey: I have it on good authority.",
        "Cassie: Who's?",
        "Jeffrey: Alonzo. Cassie, I wouldn't be telling you this if it wasn't true. And I wouldn't let anything happen to that boy.",
        "Cassie: I know that.",
        "Jeffrey: Now, you're going to have to prepare yourself because the fact of the matter is, Alonzo is the birth father, you are not the biological mother. He's going to play that card and he is going to want his son and heir by his side.",
        "Cassie: The last thing I want is to have Will pulled apart in all of this.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, he doesn't want that, either. Trust me. He loves his son and he knows that you love him, too. So he's going... you're just going to have to remind him. Remind him of why he allowed you to raise Will in the first place. Show him how loving you can be, how your presence in someone's life can make a difference and how loving... how a person being loved by you can change anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: The kid's okay, he's fine. He's on his way to see his dad.",
        "Blake: That's fine?",
        "Sebastian: It's not?",
        "Blake: He's not supposed to be with his father. He's supposed to be with me.",
        "Sebastian: Chrissie, I don't know what you want me to do.",
        "Blake: I want you to call somebody.",
        "Sebastian: They told me Cassie is already on her way to San Cristobel. He's fine, really.",
        "Blake: Really?",
        "Sebastian: Would I lie to you? Come on, Chris, I'm trying to help.",
        "Blake: Oh, god.",
        "Sebastian: Don't worry.",
        "Blake: I just so glad you're here. Just in case.",
        "Sebastian: Just in case you need someone to take care of your dirty business?",
        "Blake: Uh-uh. Just in case I need a partner to help me.",
        "Sebastian: Well, I need to take care of some personal business on my own right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Sebastian? Roger's son Sebastian wants to be friends with you? You can't trust him.",
        "Josh: I don't and I won't.",
        "Reva: If he has one ounce of Roger's blood in him...",
        "Josh: We'll see. Hello?",
        "Sebastian: Josh, my man!",
        "Josh: Speak of the devil.",
        "Sebastian: Why does everyone say that every time I talk with them?",
        "Josh: That's a good question.",
        "Sebastian: But you're still willing to give me a chance, right?",
        "Josh: I guess I am. .",
        "Sebastian: Great. Um... is your afternoon free?",
        "Josh: Hey, I always have time for friends.",
        "Reva: You're seriously in business with Sebastian?",
        "Josh: Reva, I'm playing him, he's playing me. That's what guys do.",
        "Reva: Joshua...",
        "Josh: I don't tell you how to pick your friends, Reva. That's all part of being independent, right? See ya.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: I can see how you could get a little attached to Reva. She's quite a character, I know. Seductive. She makes you want to like her. But you haven't forgotten how she walked away from you, have you? Never forget, Johnny. That's how her type treats people like us.",
        "Jonathan: You know, that's what I thought at first when I got here, but I don't know. Getting to know Reva, she's just complicated.",
        "Nate: Oh, how so? Is being self-absorbed, selfish, and a really bad mother all that complicated?",
        "Jonathan: No. But, I don't know, she turns around and she's really cool.",
        "Nate: Oh, she's cool. All right. That's nice.",
        "Jonathan: She cares about me. She loves me.",
        "Nate: Have your not heard a single word I said to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: What the heck is going on over there?",
        "Tammy: Jonathan had some girl in there before.",
        "Sandy: Sounds a little rough.",
        "Tammy: Could we not load up on images of Jonathan and his flavor of the week?",
        "Sandy: Sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: You are disappointing me! Johnny, I raised you to be this avenging angel and here you're coming on like some gutless mama's boy.",
        "Jonathan: I'm not gutless! You don't know who I am anymore!",
        "Nate: All right. You need to remember something, Johnny. It is so easy to throw around the a word like \"love.\" But the truth is, in this life you are lucky if you have one person, just one, that knows who you are, who you really are and loves you all the same. And you already have! That person, it is me! It's me! It's only me!",
        "Jonathan: No!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I don't think that's a girl in there. Maybe we should go over.",
        "Sandy: Jonathan's a big boy. I'm sure he can take care of himself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: Okay. I can understand wanting a mother's love, hmm? I can. My mother ran away from me when I was a boy and I never got over it. But it's too late for me now, Johnny. Just like it's too late for you and Reva. Reva made her choice when she tossed you to the curb like trash. But, Johnny, ha, ha, ha, here's the joke: She's the trash. Yes, yes! That's what I wanted. That fire in you, rage, and a bitter, bitter, rotten to the core Johnny. You are a killer and you know it. ( Laughs ) okay, here's the plan, okay? You took that job with the Lewis's, that's a good move. We will bleed them dry before they realize they're bleeding.",
        "Jonathan: I already gave you my trust fund. Isn't that enough?",
        "Nate: No. That was seed money. It's all gone. We're just getting started.",
        "Jonathan: No. I'm done with you. I am never going to do another damn thing you tell me to do again!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Don't be afraid. We'll get through this together, okay?",
        "Alonzo: Hello, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Will's my son.",
        "Alonzo: And mine.",
        "Jeffrey: I'll leave you to discuss this, okay?",
        "Cassie: You had your people take him away from his home, Alonzo.",
        "Alonzo: I didn't want to do that. But, look, Will had a great time on the plane. He knows you're down here now and he's with Mrs. Everest and he loves her.",
        "Cassie: I know that. But he needs his mother.",
        "Alonzo: A child needs family.",
        "Cassie: He has a family. I thought you understood that.",
        "Alonzo: There was a time I thought he was better off with you and Richard, but things have changed. I'm settled in here and now you're with Edmund. And my child will never call Edmund Winslow \"father.\" My child is the heir to the throne of San Cristobel. He belongs here. He belongs with his people and if push comes to shove, he's my flesh.",
        "Cassie: Well, you know, being a parent isn't just D.N.A.",
        "Alonzo: You knew this day would come, Cassie. Hey, buddy.",
        "Cassie: Hey, Will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: We need a doctor.",
        "Dinah: Edmund, no, no, no. No. What I just felt, it's a good thing. It's a good thing. I felt the baby kicking.",
        "Edmund: What?",
        "Dinah: You want to feel? ( Laughter )",
        "Edmund: It's so soft. It's like feeling a butterfly. Dinah...",
        "Dinah: It's real. ( Laughs )",
        "Edmund: How could this possibly be? You're not even showing.",
        "Dinah: Thank you. Thank you for getting me through this. Thank you. I'm grateful to share this moment with you. Thank you. This baby is going to be extremely lucky to have a father like you and when I have my own child one day, I want the father to be exactly like you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: Nice.",
        "Josh: You were doing it wrong.",
        "Sebastian: Obviously.",
        "Josh: Your father never taught you how to pitch pennies, huh?",
        "Sebastian: No, he was too busy dying by the time I caught up with him.",
        "Josh: Sorry about that.",
        "Sebastian: Hmm.",
        "Josh: This is something I used to do with my son when he was younger. We did it for fun, actually. This is not that.",
        "Sebastian: It's not?",
        "Josh: No. But I guess if we're going to work together to bring down Alan Spaulding we have to start trusting each other, right?",
        "Sebastian: Yeah. Or at least, you know, pretending to trust each other.",
        "Josh: And maybe I have to teach you how to pitch pennies.",
        "Sebastian: It's all about form, right?",
        "Josh: Everything in life is about form, my friend. And this has got to be one of the weirdest days of my entire life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: ( Laughs ) Oh, we are going to have to do something about your attitude.",
