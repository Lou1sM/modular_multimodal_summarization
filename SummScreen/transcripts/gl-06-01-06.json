        "Reva: Jonathan, it's me, again. Look, I'm just calling to see if you've thought about all of this. Have you talked to Lizzie yet? It's your baby, too, you know, sweetie, and there's some things you just can't avoid. Call me. (Sighs ) Some things that you just can't avoid. ( Sighs ) Oh, I'm... ( laughs )",
        "Buzz: Wow, gee, hi. I hope he's worth it.",
        "Reva: Uh, who?",
        "Buzz: The guy you're willing to run me over for.",
        "Reva: Oh... ( laughs )",
        "Buzz: I like the do, the hairdo. It's nice.",
        "Reva: Oh! Oh, yeah. Uh, change of life moment.",
        "Buzz: Okay. It's one of those days, huh?",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, it's one of those lifetimes.",
        "Buzz: Okay. Look, I won't ask, but... I can't ignore a friend who needs a boost.",
        "Reva: And what kind of boost did you have in mind, Buzz Cooper?",
        "Buzz: Come with me, Reva.",

        "Josh: Was that about our surprise, by any chance?",
        "Cassie: Your surprise. Reva's surprise. But yes.",
        "Josh: Mm-hmm.",
        "Cassie: And it turns out everything is right on schedule.",
        "Josh: That's a good thing, because that gives us some time to concentrate on the important things in life, like gossip.",
        "Cassie: Oh.",
        "Josh: ( Laughs )",
        "Cassie: Wow, I may be selfish, but I'm just glad it's not my baby having a baby.",
        "Josh: What, you're not excited about the idea of Jonathan and Tammy procreating?",
        "Cassie: ( Fake laugh ) Not even funny. Thank you. I am trying with those two. I really am. But he does not make it easy.",
        "Josh: What now?",
        "Cassie: I had to ask them to leave.",
        "Josh: Dare I ask why?",
        "Cassie: Broke the house rule, the only house rule-- or at least the only one that mattered, for that matter. I don't know. If it hadn't been that, it would have been something else.",
        "Jeffrey: Hi, Josh.",
        "Josh: Hi.",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Jeffrey? Hi.",
        "Jeffrey: Sorry if I'm interrupting something. Tammy called me and, well, she asked me to help Jonathan with his pending legal issues.",
        "Josh: Huh.",
        "Cassie: She did?",
        "Josh: Yeah, that's funny, because I told her not to call you.",

        "Josh: Well, I just... don't think Cassie needs to be around you right now.",

        "Alan-Michael: Just come right out with it, Dinah. \"Don't fire me, Harley, please. Bosses get stabbed in the back every day. Friends betray their best friends all the time. You can trust me.\"",
        "Dinah: Harley and I are fine. We're fine. You just want to see two girls go at it, don't you?",
        "Alan-Michael: ( Laughs ) Maybe. Put my money on you, though.",
        "Dinah: Me, too. But there's going to be no fight because Harley knows that I'm on her side again.",
        "Alan-Michael: Wow. You actually said that with a straight face.",
        "Dinah: I know, 'cause it's the truth. Alan-Michael, why don't you just give it up? Spaulding Enterprises is being run by people who actually care about the future.",
        "Alan-Michael: A family business should stay in the family. Why is that so hard to understand? It's good business.",
        "Dinah: Is that what we're doing here, \"good business\"?",
        "Alan-Michael: Absolutely. But getting even with you... well, that's personal, Dinah. Don't think I'll forget what you've done. And when I do take my revenge-- and I will-- I intend to enjoy every minute.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Good. Come on in. I want to ask something. So you handle on the deliveries here, right? 9-to-5 room service, mail, right? So, how did this get into my room? Did you leave it in my room?",
        "Bellhop: No.",
        "Mallet: Okay, well, if you didn't leave it here, I already know housekeeping didn't. How did this get here if you didn't leave it?",
        "Bellhop: Honestly, Detective, it wasn't me.",
        "Mallet: Right. Okay. Thanks. Oh, Fred, here. Sorry. Thanks.",
        "Bellhop: Thanks a lot. Oh, I almost forgot. Miss Marler's dry cleaning got dropped off.",
        "Mallet: Oh, yeah, the little black number with the slit up to... never mind. Thank you for that.",
        "Bellhop: No, thank you.",
        "Mallet: That's a weird- looking receipt. Hey, Fred, sorry. Got a few more questions. Where did this dry cleaning come from? I mean, how long was it in the lobby? Did anybody have access to it where it was stored?",
        "Bellhop: Look, my manager told me to deliver it when you called. That's all.",
        "Mallet: That's all you know?",
        "Bellhop: That's it.",

        "Alan-Michael: No threats, just promises. You'll be very sorry you didn't stick with me. I promise.",

        "Alan-Michael: You tell me. Hey.",

        "Alan-Michael: Two old friends just getting a couple of things straight, that's all.",

        "Alan-Michael: It's business, Marina.",
        "Marina: As in none of mine.",
        "Alan-Michael: If you want us to have any kind of relationship, you need to stay out of this part of my life.",
        "Dinah: Are you crazy enough to think that this beautiful girl would even be interested in you again after what you did to her aunt?",
        "Alan-Michael: My dealings with Harley are strictly business. Marina and I... well, that's something completely different.",
        "Dinah: ( Whispering ) This is where you put him in his place.",
        "Alan-Michael: If she really feels that there's no future for us, then maybe she should return one or two of the gifts I've sent.",
        "Dinah: Oh, he gave you gifts. What a surprise.",
        "Marina: Flowers. But they died. Makes them hard to return.",
        "Alan-Michael: And the pearls, don't forget. They looked so perfect dangling that way from the orchids.",
        "Dinah: Okay, before I puke, I think you should slither your way into somebody else's life, 'cause you're not going to get the company, and you're definitely not going to get the girl. I'm going to make sure of that.",
        "Alan-Michael: Now who's threatening who, Dinah? Marina, I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who felt how good it could be between us, how good it was.",
        "Dinah: He's an arrogant jerk. And unfortunately, he's planning to do something with Spaulding. I don't know what it is, but I have to figure it out fast.",
        "Marina: You know, Dinah, I think I might know just the thing to help you out.",
        "Dinah: Oh, no. No, no, no, no. Your father would kill me if he found out I was pushing you towards Alan-Michael again.",
        "Marina: Hey, who's pushing? No one's pushing anybody here. This is... this is all me. You need someone on the inside, and if I could get him to think that I want him back...",
        "Dinah: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Do you want him back?",
        "Marina: I just want to help.",
        "Dinah: Look, Marina, we'll talk about this later, all right? But let me tell you something: He's a very dangerous guy, and you need to stay clear of that, okay? I don't want anymore drama between me and your family.",
        "Marina: Hello? You're not listening to me here, okay? This is all me. It's all my decision. I can take care of myself.",
        "Dinah: All right, look, we'll talk later. Okay? Okay.",

        "Jeffrey: So you think Cassie would be better off staying away from me, hmm? And you just decided that on your own?",
        "Josh: ( Laughs ) I just think you guys need a little space from each other.",
        "Cassie: Okay, okay, okay, Josh, I think I'll... I can handle this.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, that's a good idea.",
        "Cassie: I'm sorry, I... I wouldn't have called you. I don't... don't think it's fair to ask you to help.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Well, you know what? It doesn't matter, because I'm not sure how much help I can be. See, the D.A., the new D.A., has put me in charge of Jonathan's case.",
        "Cassie: So you're going to prosecute Jonathan's case?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, she's assigned me to it, and I don't see that there's any way out of it. And between you and me, she does have a hell of a case against him-- with her own underage daughter as the primary witness. So somebody needs to talk to Jonathan and get him to take a deal while he still can. But you didn't hear that from me. Oh, and next time I need to talk to you, maybe I'll just go straight to your personal answering machine, okay?",

        "Buzz: Ava did it for Liz and Coop's baby. The things people do for love.",
        "Reva: Coop and Ava?",
        "Buzz: Oh, nothing's going to come of it, you know. They're both being very grown up and unselfish.",
        "Reva: Ah. Like us, huh?",
        "Buzz: ( Laughs ) Exactly. I'm not... I'm not crazy about the idea of Coop being connected to Lizzie for the rest of his life, but, you know, I'm kind of sappy about this... this new baby thing.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, I understand that.",
        "Buzz: I kind of like this grandfather thing. You know, it's the lower expectations, I think. I think I'm good at it.",
        "Reva: Oh, you are good at it. I mean, you were always Susan's favorite.",
        "Buzz: Girls like me.",
        "Reva: I like you, too. So you ever think these things come around for a reason?",
        "Buzz: You think Lizzie and Coop belong together?",
        "Reva: No, no. I'm not talking about that. I just mean... you know, you're going along and your life just happens, and then something comes around and knocks you flat. You think someone's trying to tell you something.",
        "Buzz: If so, I must have done something pretty good along the way, because here I am, still around to greet the newest member of the family. So it doesn't get much better than that.",
        "Reva: Not much.",
        "Buzz: You know what this makes me think of? Two years ago, me lying flat on the floor, hanging on by a thread.",
        "Reva: Oh, your heart attack.",
        "Buzz: Yeah. Just... just to be here, to appreciate all this stuff, you know?",
        "Reva: I do know. It's a beautiful room. Thanks, Buzz.",
        "Buzz: I hope you're going someplace fun.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) Yeah, well... no, it's... it's... it's great. And the baby's going to love it. I can still make it.",

        "Cassie: I can't believe that Jeffrey is going to prosecute Jonathan's case.",
        "Josh: Well, I'm just hoping he can move it along, that's all. I miss my wife. You know, I'm having the time of my life working on this veteran's project. I want her by my side, but I can't really compete with Jonathan.",
        "Cassie: I'm sure you'll have her all wrapped up just as soon as you reveal your little surprise.",
        "Josh: My little surprise, yes. I think if I don't tell her soon, my head's going to explode.",
        "Cassie: Oh, don't do that. Messy.",

        "Reva: What about the little cowgirl?",
        "Josh: She'll be fine. Come on.",
        "Reva: No. You know what? I'll just meet you later, because I have an... an errand.",
        "Josh: Are you playing hard to get?",
        "Reva: I might be. How's it working for ya? Does this surprise have something to do with this project of yours?",
        "Josh: Yes and no. What about what you're doing? Does that have something to do with Jonathan, by any chance?",
        "Reva: Yeah, what else? So I'd better go.",
        "Josh: You should know Jeffrey is going to be prosecuting Jonathan's case.",

        "Josh: Okay. Is there anything that I can do?",
        "Reva: Nothing. You've already got enough on your plate as it is.",
        "Josh: ( Sighs ) It's just that once we get past this Jonathan debacle, I'll have you back, and my life will be perfect.",
        "Reva: You deserve that. More than anyone else. And I owe you so much. So as soon as I'm done with whatever it is I'm going to do, I'm all yours.",

Some people aren't lucky enough to watch their kids grow up, or their kids' kids... be able to hold that little baby. That wonderful smell. Having my own kids was always marred by some drama or trauma, and now this new little baby? It's a whole new beginning. And that's what I want.",
