        "Bill: Where's Tony? \r\n",
        "Danny: I don't know. \r\n",
        "Bill: You haven't seen him?\r\n",
        "Danny: No. He was here \r\nearlier, but he took off. ",
        "Bill: You knew. ",
        "Danny: Where have you been? \r\nMan, bill, you've been drinking. ",
        "Bill: You knew. Oh, wow. \r\nGold star for Danny. That's very perceptive. ",
        "Danny: Why don't you go home \r\nand t some sleep? ",
        "Bill: No, no, Danny. I'm not going anywhere until you get... I \r\nget some answers. How did you know that \r\nEden was alive? ",
        "Danny: Bill, now is not the \r\ntime. ",
        "Bill: No. ",
        "Danny: Keep it down. \r\n",
        "Bill: Keep it down? \r\n",
        "Danny: Yeah. Keep it down.\r\n",
        "\r\n\r\nBill: I'm not keeping anything down. You tell me. I want to \r\nknow. You knew. You sent me over there knowing I was going to find \r\nEden. How did you know she was \r\nalive? ",
        "\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
        "\r\n\r\nGus: I'm going to go with my instincts on this one, okay? And \r\nmy instincts say that it's brad green at Spaulding. Brad Green is the connection \r\nat Spaulding for Vinnie Salerno. ",
        "Harley: Okay, and you know \r\nhow much I hope you're right, but if you're not... ",
        "\r\n\r\nGus: Just don't point the finger at Alan for a while, okay? \r\nHe's already a prime target. O\u2019Neill would love to have him as a collar. The \r\nfeds are all over him. That's why I got to... ",
        "Harley: Protect him. Save \r\nhim, right? ",
        "\r\n\r\nGus: Come with me, okay? Come with me to \r\nEden\u2019s. Come with me to Eden\u2019s. \r\nWe'll find something that connects brad green to Vinnie Salerno. Oh, come on. \r\nJust... ",
        "\r\n\r\nHarley: Honey, I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t. I've got to go to the office. \r\nI've got to pull up the files on the greens, and then I want to go to cedars and \r\nsee Michelle. ",
        "Gus: I'll see you later, \r\nthen. ",
        "Harley: Okay, wait. Wait a \r\nsecond. Be careful. Please. I love you. I just... I don't want you to get hurt, \r\nokay? ",
        "Gus: Sweetie, you've got \r\nnothing to worry about. Nothing. ",
        "\r\n\r\nAlan: \r\n\r\n\r\nJoey: I can tell Lizzie. She's a friend, you know? She needs \r\nto know the truth. So, I was hoping I was going to get some money-- a grant, \r\nactually, to pay for classes in the fall. But I just found out that my \r\napplication was late, so I'm not getting any money. ",
        "Lizzie: Joey, I'm sorry.\r\n",
        "\r\n\r\nJoey: Yeah, well, my mom keeps telling me she's going to come \r\nup with the Cas and I'd hate for her to work two jobs, so I got to do what I got \r\nto do to come up with the money myself. ",
        "\r\n\r\nLizzie: I wish there was something I could do. Um, you know \r\nwhat? I'll be right back. Just wait here, okay? Don't go anywhere. ",
        "Joey: Okay. Thanks, Lizzie.\r\n",
        "Lizzie: Hi, Aunt Alex. Are \r\nyou all right? ",
        "\r\n\r\nGus: Give me the box. Give me the box. I didn't ask you to do \r\nthis. I need to do this. I need to do this for myself. This was my sister.\r\n",
        "Alan: Look, I understand \r\nthat. ",
        "\r\n\r\nGus: And you know, Bill... don't you think Bill should be \r\nhere? Her future husband, he should be here if you're doing something like this, \r\nnot to mention the fact that he lives here. Did you think about that when you \r\nlet yourself in? ",
        "Alan: No, I was only \r\nthinking of you. ",
        "Gus: How did you get in \r\nhere? ",
        "Alan: The superintendent let \r\nme in. I explained the situation, and he was kind enough to let me in. \r\n",
        "Gus: How much did you pay \r\nhim? ",
        "Alan: Is that really \r\nimportant? ",
        "Gus: You need to understand \r\nsomething here, al. You cannot control every single little situation. \r\n",
        "Alan: Is that what you think \r\nI'm trying to do, control... ",
        "Gus: When you bribe somebody \r\nto get yourself into places that you shouldn't be-- isn't that what you did?\r\n",
        "Alan: I just want to help \r\nyou. That's all. ",
        "Gus: Well, thank you. I \r\nappreciate that. ",
        "Steve: The last thing I \r\nwant, Gus, is to be pushy. But if you change your mind, please... ",
        "Gus: Yeah, no problem. It's \r\nokay. I will call you first. Look, thank you. ",
        "\r\n\r\nAlan: Look, I have no idea the pain you must be experiencing \r\nright now. Alex and I fight all of the time, but if anything ever happened to \r\nher, I would be beside myself. ",
        "\r\n\r\nGus: That's why you have to think to yourself, you know you've \r\ngot to be happy with what you've got while you still have it. ",
        "Alan: And that is why I'm \r\nhere. You see, you and I want the same thing. ",
        "Gus: Right. ",
        "Alan: You have Harley, but \r\nyou also have me. I mean, we're a family. We're not perfect. ",
        "Gus: Nobody's perfect.\r\n",
        "Alan: But we're a family, \r\nand don't forget, we're your family. ",
        "Gus: Fine, if I need you, I \r\nwill call you, okay? I will. ",
        "Alan: Please do. ",
        "Gus: Okay. When are you \r\ngoing to stop lying to me, Al? ",
        "\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
        "Alexandra: Yes. ",
        "Lizzie: So get some more.\r\n",
        "Alexandra: New blood, \r\nuh-huh. And whom do you have in mine here? ",
        "\r\n\r\nLizzie: Well, see sandy kind of pushed me, but it's my idea. I \r\nwas thinking why Spaulding doesn\u2019t host a contest for, say, high school senior \r\nand college students. ",
        "Alexandra: Well, it sounds a \r\nlot like our internship program now. ",
        "Lizzie: But no, it's nothing \r\nlike that. I mean, who wants to intern at a company that's under investigation?\r\n",
        "Alexandra: (Laughs) all \r\nright, what's the spin? ",
        "\r\n\r\nLizzie: We'll offer an incentive. Okay, we'll get a whole crew \r\nof fresh new faces and they'll come up with ideas, of products and ways to \r\nmarket them, and the best idea wins. ",
        "Alexandra: Wins what, dear?\r\n",
        "\r\n\r\nLizzie: A job, working with you and Grandpa Alan, and you can \r\ntake whoever it is under your wing. Lucky person. ",
        "Alexandra: (Laughs) well \r\nit's an interesting idea. ",
        "Lizzie: And maybe you \r\nshould, I don't know, pay their college tuition as parts of the deal? Well, do \r\nyou like it? ",
        "Alexandra: As a matter of \r\nfact, Lizzie, I do, I do, but we're going to have to run it past your \r\ngrandfather first. ",
        "Lizzie: Oh, he won't be a \r\nproblem. I'm so happy you like it. I have a feeling you're not going to be the \r\nonly one. ",
        "Alexandra: Ah. ",
        "\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
        "Cassie: Have you been \r\nwatching Edmund as part of your investigation? ",
        "Jeffrey: Yes. ",
        "Cassie: Are you kidding me? \r\nEdmund? ",
        "Jeffrey: It's not that much \r\nof a stretch, Cassie. ",
        "Cassie: This is ridiculous.\r\n",
        "Jeffrey: Hang on, let me try \r\nyou explain. ",
        "Cassie: You can explain all \r\nyou want, but I'm still going to think it's ridiculous. ",
        "\r\n\r\nJeffrey: This started a number of years ago when your husband \r\nwas still leader of San Cristobel. There was a lot of antimonious being produced \r\non the island and... well, we feared the mob wanted to get a piece of the \r\naction. ",
        "Cassie: Richard would have \r\nnever stood for that. ",
        "\r\n\r\nJeffrey: Well, he may or may not have known anything about it, \r\nbut Edmund certainly would have done anything to oppose his brother back then, \r\nand I think you know that. ",
        "\r\n\r\nCassie: You lied to me. When I asked you if and you Richard \r\never crossed paths, you said... you pretended like you never even heard of him.\r\n",
        "Jeffrey: I was undercover.\r\n",
        "Cassie: So have you just \r\nbeen spying on everyone? ",
        "Jeffrey: The drugs, made a \r\npath to Springfield, okay? I followed the drugs here. ",
        "Cassie: Did you ever meet \r\nRichard? Did you talk to him about Edmund? Did you talk to him about the drugs?\r\n",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie... \r\n",
        "\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
        "Coming up on \"Guiding \r\nLight\"... ",
        "Danny: You going to nail \r\nSalerno? ",
        "Harley: I'm going to try.\r\n",
        "Edmund: What was that about?\r\n",
        "Cassie: Edmund, I have to \r\nask you something. ",
        "Edmund: Is everything all \r\nright? ",
        "Jeffrey: Edmund. ",
        "Cassie: I uh... ",
        "Jeffrey: We were just \r\ntalking about the San Cristobel gala coming up. ",
        "Edmund: And I do hope you \r\nbought your tickets. ",
        "Jeffrey: Not yet, but I am \r\nlooking forward to it, and everyone is telling me it's going to be a rocking \r\naffair. ",
        "Edmund: Well, I don't know \r\nif I'd use the term \"rocking,\" but we do hope bring business to the island.\r\n",
        "\r\n\r\nJeffrey: That's a lofty goal. How is business on the island \r\nanyway, Edmund? Things moving well, you know, imports, exports? ",
        "Cassie: Why don't you buy an \r\nencyclopedia and find out. ",
        "Jeffrey: Do they print those \r\nthings any more? You know with the internet... ",
        "Edmund: Business is good.\r\n",
        "\r\n\r\nJeffrey: Well, good, I'm glad to hear it. So you expect a lot \r\nof people, you know, making the trip from the island for the party? ",
        "Edmund: I imagine many will \r\nmake the trip. I'm curious, Mr. O\u2019Neil, why the sudden interest in San \r\nCristobel? ",
        "\r\n\r\nJeffrey: Well, Cassie was just painting such a lovely picture \r\nof the place, I was a picture of the place, I was thinking about buying a time \r\nshare. With your face, I don't think you'd find it very relaxing. That's right. \r\nI didn't even think of that. ",
        "\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
        "Lizzie: I'm delighted you're \r\nable to be with us? Tammy, I invited your friend, Kira. ",
        "Sandy: What's going on? You \r\nwere so mysterious on the phone and insistent. ",
        "Lizzie: It\u2019s because it's \r\nimportant. ",
        "Sandy: Is this about the...\r\n",
        "Lizzie: I want to do it.\r\n",
        "Sandy: Okay. It's all you. \r\nPitch it. ",
        "Tammy: We've been waiting \r\nlong enough. ",
        "Lizzie: Oh, hi Kira. \r\n",
        "Tammy: Hi, Lizzie. \r\n",
        "\r\n\r\nLizzie: Yeah, Tammy told me you got a job the club together. \r\nThat's great. In fact, all of you probably have plans for summer right now, \r\nright? ",
        "Sandy: I'm working at the \r\ncollege radio station, unless have you a better idea. ",
        "Tammy: Company, where else.\r\n",
        "Lizzie: What about you \r\nShayne? ",
        "Shayne: I think I'm going to \r\ncoach a little bit of little league. ",
        "Lizzie: Okay, wow. That's \r\nexciting. But not as exciting as what I have to tell you. ",
        "Marina: This should be good.\r\n",
        "Lizzie: Spaulding will host \r\na contest for people our age. ",
        "Shayne: So it's, what, an \r\ninternship? ",
        "Lizzie: Do you really think \r\nI would call you guys over here for some silly internship? Come on. ",
        "Tammy: Kind of sounds like \r\nan internship. ",
        "Lizzie: Well, that's because \r\nI haven't finished yet, Tammy. ",
        "Tammy: Sorry. ",
        "\r\n\r\nLizzie: No problem, sweetie. Anyway as I was saying, it's a \r\ncontest, and by the end of the summer we will all walk away with the knowledge \r\nof the inner workings of a major conglomerate. I mean, it's a major resume \r\nbuilder. ",
        "Sandy: Well, I don't get it. \r\nYou said that this is a contest though. ",
        "Lizzie: It is a contest. We \r\nwill all be competing this summer to improve ourselves. ",
        "Tammy: Wait a second. You're \r\ntaking part in your family company's contest? ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, why wouldn't \r\nI. ",
        "Shayne: Well, who's going to \r\nbe judging this little contest? ",
        "Lizzie: My Aunt Alex and \r\ngrandfather. They're very fair people. ",
        "Tammy: How about impartial?\r\n",
        "Lizzie: This will help \r\neveryone with their future. I mean it, all of you. ",
        "Tammy: Okay. ",
        "Sandy: So what is the winner \r\nget? ",
        "Lizzie: A job. ",
        "Sandy: A job? That's good \r\nwith a conglomerate. ",
        "\r\n\r\nLizzie: And it's so much more than that. You guys, you don't \r\nunderstand. The last person standing at the end of the summer is going to learn \r\nthe ropes from Alan Spaulding himself. ",
        "Shayne: So the winner gets \r\nto hang out with your grandpa? ",
        "Lizzie: No. I guess I'm not \r\nexplaining it right or something? ",
        "Tammy: Well, no, I get it, \r\nbut I think I'm going to have to pass. ",
        "Sandy: Yeah, I think me, \r\ntoo. ",
        "Shayne: Yeah, I'd rather be \r\nsitting by a pool. ",
        "Tammy: Yeah, me too. \r\n",
        "\r\n\r\nLizzie: But you guys aren't even giving me a chance. Tammy, \r\nyou don't know how much fun this could be. Tammy! ",
        "Tammy: I'm just not \r\ninterested in business. I'm going to go to company. ",
        "Sandy: Sounds good to me.\r\n",
        "Shayne: Yeah, I can get some \r\nfood. I'm driving. ",
        "Tammy: Okay. ",
        "Sandy: Valiant effort. Keep \r\nworking on it. ",
        "\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
        "Harley: Any change? So, I \r\nhear you're looking for answers about Eden. ",
        "Bill: No, actually I wanted \r\nto know what's going on with Danny. I want to know what he's up to, that's all.\r\n",
        "Harley: Why, what will that \r\ndo for you? ",
        "Bill: Well, Harley, I am \r\ntired of finding out things when it's too late to do anything about it. \r\n",
        "Harley: Really? ",
        "Bill: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Harley: That's what you care \r\nabout right now? ",
        "Bill: Yeah, yeah. \r\n",
        "Harley: I don't think so. I \r\ndon't think you care about Danny. ",
        "Bill: Well, then Harley, why \r\ndon't you tell me. You seem to be the expert on what I care about. ",
        "Harley: I think you're angry \r\nabout \r\n  Eden\r\n\r\nLizzie: Okay, listen. You guys probably think Spaulding is \r\nthis big, boring company that does a lot of stuff that up doesn\u2019t care about, \r\nright? ",
        "Shayne: Well, no offense.\r\n",
        "\r\n\r\nLizzie: None taken, but did you know that Spaulding owns a \r\ncouple minor league baseball teams. Maybe you can come up with marketing ideas \r\nfor them? ",
        "Marina: So you own a couple \r\nof minor league baseball teams? ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, and a few not \r\nso minor record labels. ",
        "Sandy: She's got through, \r\nMarina. ",
        "Lizzie: And TV and radio \r\nstations. ",
        "Sandy: Sounds good to me.\r\n",
        "Tammy: So, Kira, what about \r\nyou? ",
        "Kira: I'm not really sure \r\nyet. ",
        "Lizzie: Well, by the end of \r\nthe summer, maybe you'll have some ideas. ",
        "Tammy: Do you have any movie \r\nstudios? ",
        "\r\n\r\nLizzie: No. You know, I should be still mad at you for \r\ndeserting me. But you know grandfather has been known from time to time to \r\ninvest in Broadway shows. ",
        "Tammy: I know you were going \r\nto say that. ",
        "\r\n\r\nLizzie: The opportunities are endless. And by the way, the \r\nwinner gets a full college tuition. I know you're saying that your mom has to \r\nwork two jobs for to you to go to school, so... ",
        "Joey: Yeah, she's hardly \r\never home. I feel so bad for her. ",
        "Lizzie: There you are.\r\n",
        "Tammy: Well it's no country \r\nclub. ",
        "Joey: Mom could quit her \r\nsecond job and you and I could still be together. ",
        "\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
        "Alexandra: I asked you to \r\nhave a drink. I wish I had known you were in such a grumpy mood. ",
        "Alan: Grumpy mood? I haven't \r\nsaid two words. ",
        "Alexandra: You don't have \r\nto, darling, it's all over your face. What is it now? ",
        "Alan: It's Gus. ",
        "Alexandra: When isn't it?\r\n",
        "\r\n\r\nAlan: When it's you. I wanted so badly to help him during this \r\nperiod he's going through, but he won't let me have any part of it. ",
        "Alexandra: Oh, for heavens \r\nsakes, why not. ",
        "Alan: Let's just say there \r\nare things that still divide us. ",
        "\r\n\r\nAlexandra: There are things dividing us all over the place, \r\naren't there? It's a nightmare, which is why I think we have to start taking \r\nsome action, Alan. Starting with the negative publicity, the pitiful image of \r\nSpaulding, and we also need get Lizzie moving, because I think she can be key to \r\nour... improving our image. ",
        "Alan: Wait, this sounds \r\nfamiliar. Didn't and you sandy foster just pitch this? ",
        "Alexandra: Shh, that really \r\ndoesn't matter right now. This is Lizzie's idea. ",
        "Alan: Elizabeth\u2019s. \r\n",
        "\r\n\r\nAlexandra: I do suspect that the girl has some ulterior \r\nmotives, but I just choose not to think about it for the moment. Besides, we \r\nneed good press, Alan. We need to improve this image very badly and I think she \r\ncould do it. (Knocking on door) ",
        "\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
        "Gus: Brad Green. Brad Green. \r\nThat's \r\n  Salerno\u2019s \r\nconnection. ",
        "Harley: Okay, calm down. You \r\ndon't know that for sure. ",
        "\r\n\r\nGus: Please, come on. Brad green, he's the head of a \r\npharmaceutical division, he's the top of the... top dog, head of the food chain, \r\nhe's got to answer to nobody. He's got all the resources he needs right? It's in \r\nthe picture, look at it. ",
        "Harley: There's a fourth \r\nperson in this picture, Gus. And I know who it is. ",
        "\r\n\r\nBill: How did we get here, Michelle? Hm? How did we get to \r\nthis point in our lives? Remember when we were kids? (Laughs) and we put the \r\nlaundry detergent in the hot tub and the bubbles went all over in the back yard? \r\nHey, you what I've got to do? I've got to yell at the moon. I've got to yell at \r\nthe moon. Remember when we were kids, and Maddie taught us how to yell at the \r\nmoon? Do you remember that? Well that's what I've got to do right now? So you've \r\ngot to... you've got to get up because I don't want to yell at that moon alone. \r\nMichelle. We've got to take control. Michelle, we've got to take control of our \r\nlives because I'm telling you, I'm tired of letting things just happen. I am \r\nsick and tired of it. And I hope when you wake up, you realize the same thing. \r\nYou've got to look out for yourself. And you, you've got to keep away from \r\nanything \r\n  Santos."
