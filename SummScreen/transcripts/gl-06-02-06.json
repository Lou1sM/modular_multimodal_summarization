        "Harley: Stewart. Hello. ",
        "Stewart: Congratulations, harley. ",
        "Harley: Thank you. ",
        "Stewart: This makes me very happy. ",
        "Harley: You and me both. ",
        "Stewart: And your timing couldn't have been better. ",
        "Harley: I think so, too. ",
        "Gus: She's incredible. She's got such a great mind for business. ",
        "Harley: Hi, honey. You okay? ",
        "Gus: My wife, a mover and shaker, that one. Knows how to get things done. \r\nWhen she wants something, believe me, she gets it. ",
        "Harley: Okay, what are you doing? ",
        "Gus: I'm sorry. This is for you. As it happened, I'm off the force. Thanks \r\nfor having them take my job away from me, honey. ",
        "Alan-michael: This is starting to get old. ",
        "Dinah: Don't worry, sweetie, I don't have a firearm. It's just you and me.\r\n",
        "Tammy: Well, it was just an idea. All right, I'll talk to him about it. ",
        "Jonathan: Who was that? ",
        "Tammy: Mel. ",
        "Jonathan: Good news from my lawyer, huh? ",
        "Tammy: Doris wolfe refuses to negotiate. ",
        "Jonathan: Of course she does. She's the D.A. I got her daughter sloshed-- \r\ntwice. She wants my blood and the blood of anyone who knows me. ",
        "Tammy: Well, she's wrong. We just have to prove it. ",
        "Jonathan: You have other things that you should be doing. ",
        "Tammy: This is the most important thing. Mel says you need a witness, \r\nsomebody who can stand up for your side of the story, somebody who knows the \r\ntruth about you and ashlee. Can you think of anybody? ",
        "Rick: Lizzie, I'm sorry. I was going to call you. ",
        "Lizzie: How's my dad? ",
        "Rick: I don't know. I haven't spoken to him since this whole thing came out. \r\nI don't know where he is. ",
        "Lizzie: Oh. ",
        "Rick: But when I was in touch with him, sweetheart, he asked about you every \r\nsingle time. He loves you and he's proud of you and he really, really misses \r\nyou. ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. Were you fired? ",
        "Rick: I was suspended. ",
        "Lizzie: Uncle rick, I'm sorry. ",
        "Rick: Well, you know what? In some ways I deserved it. ",
        "Beth: Lizzie, come on, you'll be late. ",
        "Lizzie: But, mom... ",
        "Beth: Come on, lizzie. ",
        "Lizzie: You should have said something. ",
        "Beth: What do you want me to say, lizzie? He lied to everyone he supposedly \r\nloves, you and I most of all. You don't just forget that kind of deceit. ",
        "Colin: What's going on, mrs. Lewis? ",
        "Reva: You tell me. I'm having a rough time of it. ",
        "Colin: The side effects of the chemo. ",
        "Reva: You gave me that list of normal and not normal. ",
        "Colin: Yeah. ",
        "Reva: I'm seeing spots, and i feel like I'm burning up, and it's gotten \r\nprogressively worse by the minute. ",
        "Colin: You were right to come in. ",
        "Reva: No kidding. ",
        "Josh: Hi there. Excuse me. Could you tell me where I might find dr. Mccabe?\r\n",

        "Tammy: Did you talk to brad? He was working at the bar that night... ",
        "Jonathan: I am paying mel all my money to get me out of this. I have other \r\nplans for you. ",
        "Tammy: Which can wait. Jonathan, you're in trouble. ",
        "Jonathan: I know. I am, me. It's my problem, not yours. ",
        "Tammy: Why do you always do that? ",
        "Jonathan: Do what? ",
        "Tammy: Try to put this all on yourself. ",
        "Jonathan: It's not like you can fix it. ",
        "Tammy: I want to. ",
        "Jonathan: I know and I love having you on my side, but I've caused enough \r\nproblems. I just don't want this one to touch us, okay? So, please, can we do \r\nthis one my way? ",
        "Tammy: All right, for now. ",
        "Jonathan: Cool. I'm going to go take a walk. I'm going to clear my head. ",
        "Tammy: ( Laughing ) ah! Try again. What are you really going to do? ",
        "Jonathan: I'm going to go take a walk. There's A... um... bail of hay on the \r\nnorth 40 that has got my name on it. ",
        "Tammy: That sounds good for thinking. Listen, just be careful, okay? ",
        "Jonathan: What could happen to me? ",
        "Tammy: Like I said, be careful. ",
        "Jonathan: I'll see you later. ",
        "Tammy: You need my help, like it or not. ",
        "Nurse: I'm afraid dr. Mccabe is going to be a little while. Is there \r\nsomething I can help you with? ",
        "Josh: It's all right. I just need to see him on a business project I'm \r\nworking on. I'll wait. ",
        "Nurse: Okay. ",
        "Josh: Thank you. ( Cell phone ringing ) hey, tammy. ",
        "Tammy: Uncle josh, are you busy right now? ",
        "Josh: Sort of, yeah. What's up? ",
        "Tammy: I was hoping you could meet me. I need some advice. ",
        "Josh: I'm near company. Would that work? Great, I'll see you then. ",
        "Colin: How did you feel this morning when you first woke up? ",
        "Reva: Exhausted, nauseous, and a little dizzy, and it has gotten \r\nprogressively worse by the minute. ",
        "Colin: When did you first notice that redness on your chest? ",
        "Reva: I didn'T. ",
        "Colin: I can't find the diphenhydramine! ",
        "Reva: You said it was going to be bad, but you didn't say it was going to be \r\nthis bad. ",
        "Colin: Start some o2 on her right away. ",
        "Nurse: Lie back, please. ",
        "Reva: No, just... wait. Wait, wait a minute. Tell me what's going on. Hello! \r\nWould you tell me what's happening? ",
        "Colin: You're having an allergic reaction. ",
        "Reva: No, I kind of figured that out. My body's falling apart here and you \r\nwon't even talk to me! ",
        "Colin: Would you just do as the nurse asked you and lie back? ",
        "Reva: So she can do what? ",
        "Nurse: Give you some oxygen, mrs. Lewis. ",
        "Reva: Finally a straight answer. You know what? She should be the doctor and \r\nyou... ",
        "Alan-michael: Can I get you something? ",
        "Dinah: No, thank you. You don't need to be nervous. I'm not here to cause any \r\ndamage. ",
        "Alan-michael: What, no ice pick under the mattress? ",
        "Dinah: No. That would require me getting you into bed, and, quite honestly, \r\nI'm not interested. ",
        "Alan-michael: I understand. You have a dog show you need to get to, but don't \r\nknock it until you try it. ",
        "Dinah: Marina got over it pretty quick. ",
        "Alan-michael: Whatever you say. Dinah, as much as I'd love to stay here and \r\nexchange one- liners with you, I've got things to see, people to do. ",
        "Dinah: You still after harley? ",
        "Alan-michael: I'm after harley's job; there's a big difference. ",
        "Dinah: Is that what you tell yourself so you can sleep at night? ",
        "Alan-michael: I've got no problem sleeping. What did you want? ",
        "Dinah: I think you need to pick up a new hobby. ",
        "Alan-michael: I think you need to mind your own business. ",
        "Dinah: Harley is my business. I think you need to stay away from her. ",
        ">&gtLachae ach ai d lovebeeve wle best in show, protective pit bull act \r\nyou've got going, i don'T. ",
        "Dinah: I'm trying. ",
        "Alan-michael: Harley knows about us? ",
        "Dinah: Every dirty detail. ",
        "Alan-michael: And she let you keep your job? ",
        "Dinah: She hasn't fired me yet. ",
        "Alan-michael: What possessed you to tell her? I wouldn't have sold you out.\r\n",
        "Dinah: Oh, no, not yet you haven'T. ",
        "Alan-michael: You're no fun anymore. Oh, I get it. You're on the straight and \r\nnarrow for mallet. ",
        "Dinah: I told the truth because it's the right thing to do, and that's the \r\nsame reason why I'm sticking by harley. ",
        "Alan-michael: Uh-huh. ",
        "Dinah: You find that hard to believe? ",
        "Alan-michael: Then I'd have to believe you're not jealous of harley and not \r\ninsecure and not angry. ",
        "Dinah: I'm not. ",
        "Alan-michael: Fish got to swim, birds got to fly, and sooner or later, dinah \r\nhas got to do what she does best. ",
        "Harley: Excuse me for just one minute. Honey, put it away. I'm in the middle \r\nof an important meeting. ",
        "Gus: Oh, I'm sorry. Am I embarrassing you? Oh, I'm embarrassing you. She's \r\nnot as innocent as she looks, believe me. ",
        "Coleman: Harley, we can do this another time. ",
        "Harley: Stewart, no. ",
        "Coleman: My secretary will reschedule. ",
        "Harley: I cannot believe you just did that. ",
        "Gus: You had me taken off the force. ",
        "Harley: Not off the force, just time off. That was it, time off. ",
        "Gus: What did you say to him? ",
        "Harley: Nothing. ",
        "Gus: You must have said something. What, did you tell him I'm a drug addict? \r\nYou said I'm an addict? ",
        "Harley: I didn't say anything about the pills. ",
        "Gus: A junky? ",
        "Harley: No, I said you were under pressure and just needed a leave of \r\nabsence. That was it. ",
        "Gus: Why are you doing this to me? Why? ",
        "Harley: Because I'm scared. Because the last time you were out on the street, \r\nyour partner got shot. ",
        "Gus: That's what this is about. ",
        "Harley: What? ",
        "Gus: It's about him. God forbid something happen to him. ",
        "Harley: It's not about mallet. ",
        "Gus: Oh, yes-- please, this whole last year has been about mallet. ",
        "Harley: What happened to the guy in the cabin, the one who was going to break \r\nthat drug habit? Where'd he go? What happened to him? ",
        "Gus: You know, when you talk, I can't hear you anymore. But when I look at \r\nyou, all i see is you and him. I can'T... ",
        "Harley: Don't keep using that as an excuse not to fix what's really is wrong. \r\n--What's really wrong. I want to help you, but you have to let me. ",
        "Gus: Right. ",
        "Harley: What? What? Honey, let me help you. I'm right here. Let me help you. \r\nI'm right here. ",
        "Dinah: Good old alan-michael, manipulating to the end. ",
        "Alan-michael: If it makes you feel better. Gee, I hate sprinkles. --Wrinkles.\r\n",
        "Dinah: Just how weak and insecure do you think I am? Mallet and I are on \r\nfirmer ground than we've ever been. Harley and I are going to get through this. \r\nYou know, you can't shake me. ",
        "Alan-michael: I can try. ",
        "Dinah: Why don't you give it your best shot? ",
        "Alan-michael: Okay. Try this one on for size. How sure are you that the worst \r\nthing harley's done to you is sleep with mallet that one time? ",
        "Dinah: That's good. Very good. Not good enough. ",
        "Alan-michael: Don't say i didn't warn you. ",
        "Dinah: You know, I cannot wait to drive your butt out of this town. You know \r\nwhy? Because I'm tired of you and everything you represent. ",
        "Alan-michael: You mean the real you? ",
        "Dinah: No. Harley's my friend. You are my enemy. ",
        "Alan-michael: If you say so. But don't come running to me when the roof \r\nstarts falling in. Are we finished here? ",
        "Dinah: I don't know. You tell me. ",
        "Alan-michael: Yeah, we're finished. I need to take a shower. ",
        "Dinah: Is this supposed to impress me? ",
        "Alan-michael: It'll do something to you. Oh. No wrinkles, remember? ( Toilet \r\nflushes ) ( yells ) ",
        "Reva: Where am I? ",
        "Colin: I want to observe you for a few hours. ",
        "Reva: Like in the zoo? When's feeding time? ",
        "Colin: How are we feeling? ",
        "Reva: We? Well, I can't answer for you, but I'm feeling better, I think. What \r\nhappened? ",
        "Colin: You had an allergic reaction. ",
        "Reva: Right. I thought I was taking something so that wouldn't happen. ",
        "Colin: You were, but it didn't work. ",
        "Reva: So this is going to happen every time? ",
        "Colin: Well, hopefully not. This whole thing is a process. We need to keep \r\nadjusting your meds. ",
        "Reva: Okay. ",
        "Colin: Wait, wait, wait. Please, don'T... don't sit up yet. What are you \r\ndoing? ",
        "Reva: Lying back down. ",
        "Colin: ( Laughs ) wow, you followed my orders for once. ",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, don't get used to it. ",
        "Colin: Take her vitals again, julie. ",
        "Nurse: Dr. Mccabe? There is someone waiting for you in the E.R. ",
        "Colin: Oh, who? ",
        "Nurse: I didn't get a name. Um, you going to be done soon? ",
        "Colin: I'm not sure. Find out who it is. ",
        "Nurse: You know, um... a bunch of us are going out for drinks later. Do you \r\nwant to join us? ",
        "Colin: Oh, I don't think so. I have a bunch of paperwork to catch up on. My \r\nnewest oncological journal monthly just came in, so... ",
        "Reva: Wow! A wild, wicked weekend for you, huh? ",
        "Colin: Well, I don'T... i don't know anyone, anyways, so... ",
        "You'd know kristi. ",
        "Colin: Yeah, I guess so. I still think... I still think I'll pass. ",
        "Reva: Whew-ee, brilliant and clueless all at the same time. ",
        "Josh: There you go, sweetheart. ",
        "Tammy: Thank you. ",
        "Josh: You are quite welcome. ",
        "Tammy: Well, mom's really excited about the groundbreaking day. ",
        "Josh: Well, that makes two of us. But my guess is we're not here to talk \r\nabout my project. ",
        "Tammy: I've been trying to figure out a way to ask you. ",
        "Josh: Ask me what? ",
        "Tammy: I want to bring in another lawyer to help on jonathan's case. ",
        "Josh: Didn't he hire mel? ",
        "Tammy: Yeah, but she seems really distracted. ",
        "Josh: Well, that may be so, but she's a professional. I don't think you have \r\nanything to worry about there. ",
        "Tammy: I'm not, not really. I just... I think jonathan could use someone with \r\na little more bite, you know? ",
        "Josh: Like who? ",
        "Tammy: Jeffrey. I want him to help us. I thought I would run it by you first. \r\nHow do you think mom is going to react? ",
        "Josh: Oh, having her ex who lied to her hanging around? I don't see why she \r\nwouldn't love that. ",
        "Lizzie: I just feel bad. Uncle rick got suspended. ",
        "Beth: Yeah, I know. ",
        "Lizzie: And you didn't do anything? ",
        "Beth: Lizzie, I couldn't even if I wanted to. ",
        "Lizzie: Oh, come on. Our family practically runs this place. ",
        "Beth: Okay, I didn't want to. ",
        "Lizzie: Mom, uncle rick is your oldest and dearest friend. ",
        "Beth: Lizzie, I don't want to talk about this. I have an appointment. I'll \r\nsee you later. ",
        "Lizzie: Hey, where did you come from? ",
        "Jonathan: Hell. You sent me there, remember? ",
        "Lizzie: Okay, your problems with ashlee and her mother, not my fault. ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, they are. And I'm going to give you a chance to make things \r\nright. ",
        "Lizzie: Or what? ",
        "Jonathan: Or what? That little baby there is going to grow up without coop as \r\nhis daddy. ",
        "Topelfrey, \"inside the ",
        "light.\" ",
        "Stephanie, she's fantastic. Stephanie makes me feel very comfortable, and \r\nworking with her is a real pleasure. Kim zimmer is out of control. When I work \r\nwith kim zimmer, I'm always in a good mood and always laughing, and as a person, \r\nshe is just the real deal. I mean, somebody who is always giving you that much \r\nhonesty and openness, and it'S... her attitude is so infectious, and i think it \r\nraises the desire to be creative and have fun and, you know, get to work. ",
        "See jonathan on wednesday, ",
        "may 24, \"inside the light.\" ",
        "Dinah: My, my, my, are we having some liquid lunch? ",
        "Gus: It's my new diet. ",
        "Dinah: Okay. Well, you know what? You're not going anywhere like this. ",
        "Gus: Yes, I am. I got to refill it up. I'm all out. ",
        "Dinah: No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You need to sleep this off. ",
        "Gus: No, and I don't need a babysitter 'cause I'm not a baby. ",
        "Dinah: I know you're not... I know you're not a baby. But guess what? You're \r\nnot going anywhere. Because if you're going to self- destruct, you're not going \r\nto do it with the aid of some heavy machinery. Okay? ",
        "Colin: Well, you're obviously feeling better. I guess I'll check back in a \r\nhalf hour or so. ",
        "Reva: Who's in denial now? ",
        "Colin: I don't know what you're talking about. ",
        "Reva: The nurse. The one who found every reason she could to keep touching \r\nyour arm. ",
        "Colin: Okay, don't you have more important things to worry about, mrs. Lewis?\r\n",
        "Reva: Yes, I do. Which is why I'm trying to keep my mind off it by bugging \r\nyou. ",
        "Colin: Okay, look, I'm sorry, I have other patients to go see, and for the \r\nrecord, I don't date nurses, so... ",
        "Reva: Who do you date? ",
        "Colin: You know what? You're my patient. I'm not having this conversation \r\nwith you. ",
        "Reva: I have poison running through my veins, doc. You could at least help \r\ndistract me. ",
        "Colin: Well, that's why we have magazines. ",
        "Reva: But you're so much more fun. ",
        "Colin: Well, nurse kristi thought I was okay... ",
        "Reva: Kristi. See, you remembered her name. How's your social life? ",
        "Colin: ( Sighs ) ",
        "Reva: That's what I thought. ",
        "Colin: When I try to get out there, you know, I just... i don't really do \r\nthat well. ",
        "Reva: Oh, really? ",
        "Colin: I guess I tend to be... ",
        "Reva: Cold? Socially inept? ",
        "Colin: Well, I was going to say shy, but... ",
        "Reva: Well, we can go with that. Look, doc, you keep saying and talking about \r\nhow you're saving my life. I thought maybe I might pay you back a little bit.\r\n",
        "Colin: How? By getting me a date with a nurse? ",
        "Reva: Oh, go out. Have a drink, have two. Maybe it'll loosen you up a bit. \r\nAnd you should get to know the people you work with. And you know something? You \r\nhappen to be looking at the bearer of life's greatest secret known to mankind.\r\n",
        "Colin: Oh, yeah? What's that? ",
        "Reva: What women want. ",
        "Colin: ( Laughs ) ",
        "Josh: Yeah, thank you. I'll get back to you. ",
        "Tammy: Did you call jeffrey? ",
        "Josh: Tammy, you asked my opinion and I gave you my opinion, all right? \r\nBesides, you know everything that jeffrey put your mom through. ",
        "Tammy: It was a bad idea. I shouldn't have brought it up. ",
        "Josh: You're going to ask him, anyway, aren't you? ",
        "Tammy: Jonathan needs help from someone on the inside. ",
        "Josh: Jeffrey's job is to put guys like jonathan away, not to defend... ",
        "Tammy: Guys like jonathan? ",
        "Josh: I don't mean anything like that, tammy. I'm just saying... ",
        "Tammy: Okay, whatever, whatever. If it was aunt reva in trouble, wouldn't you \r\nwant to do everything you could to help her? ",
        "Josh: Yes, I would, but even she wouldn't want me to hurt somebody I love in \r\nthe process, all right? Especially not somebody as important as your mom. ",
        "Tammy: I'll talk to her about it first. I'll try to make her understand. ",
        "Josh: Put yourself in her shoes. Would you understand? ",
        "Tammy: I might. ",
        "Josh: Tammy, darling,, i think you're being just a little selfishere, all \r\nright? I'm sorry to say that, but i think sometimes when you're with jonathan, \r\nyou lose... ",
        "Tammy: Jonathan didn't even want me involved in this, okay? ",
        "Josh: Then I think you should think about listening to him. ",
        "Tammy: Well, I can't just do nothing. ",
        "Josh: I'm not asking you to do nothing, sweetheart. There's a thousand \r\nlawyers out there. You want another lawyer for him? We can handle that, but I \r\ndon't know that it's going to help anything. ",
        "Tammy: Well, it has to. Because this time jonathan didn't do anything wrong, \r\nnothing. ",
        "Jonathan: Ow! Hey! ",
        "Lizzie: Don't you ever touch me again. And stay away from coop, too. ",
        "Jonathan: Relax, I'm not interested in henry. ",
        "Lizzie: Then why did you just say...? ",
        "Jonathan: I'm threatening you, lizzie, only you. ",
        "Lizzie: You don't have anything on me that I don't have on you. ",
        "Jonathan: True. But I think you have more to lose than I do. ",
        "Lizzie: How so? ",
        "Jonathan: Well, you have coop now, but he's got both eyes on ava. He finds \r\nout you lied to him again? ",
        "Lizzie: Wait, I didn't lie to him. I didn't! ",
        "Jonathan: Did you tell him you got in my pants? I didn't think so. ",
        "Lizzie: Okay, I really hate to pull the pin out here, but we're kind of in \r\nthe same boat. Do you think that tammy is going to stand by her man when she \r\nfinds out what you did? ",
        "Jonathan: Let's go ask her. ",
        "Lizzie: What? You're out of your mind! ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I'm nuts. Let's go. ",
        "Lizzie: She's never going to forgive you, ever. ",
        "Jonathan: We'll see. She'll be mad at first, sure, but she'll get over it. Me \r\nand tammy have been through some really bad things. We always end up on top. Can \r\nyou say the same about you and coop? ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. ",
        "Jonathan: Okay, let's test my little theory. ",
        "Rick: Mind if I join you? ",
        "Harley: Why not? ",
        "Rick: I was going to call you. I just wanted to give you a couple of days.\r\n",
        "Harley: Probably a good idea. ",
        "Rick: I'm sorry. I am truly, truly sorry. ",
        "Harley: Do you have any idea what you've done? I mean, I let my guard down. I \r\ndidn't know he was out there. ",
        "Rick: I did this to protect everyone. He promised me he was going to stay \r\naway. ",
        "Harley: Okay, and what if he had taken the kids again? What then? ",
        "Rick: I trusted him. I trusted him when he told me he wanted to get better, \r\nand I made a mistake. ",
        "Harley: You made a huge mistake, rick. ",
        "Rick: I just want us to find a way for us to get past this, harley, please.\r\n",
        "Harley: We have a child together. I don't think we have a choice. ",
        "Rick: Just... all I want is a chance to regain your trust; that's all, just a \r\nchance. ",
        "Harley: Rick, you hurt a lot of people. ",
        "Rick: Harley, if I knew a way... if I knew a way that i could make this up to \r\neverybody, I would. ",
        "Harley: Maybe you can. ",
        "Rick: How? Just tell me. ",
        "Harley: Fix gus. ",
        "Dinah: Honey, do you really think that's going to make things better? ",
        "Gus: I think it makes it better 'cause I'm going to be drunk and I don't have \r\nto solve anything... ",
        "Dinah: Honey, I think you're drunk already. ",
        "Gus: You're very argumentative. ",
        "Dinah: Yeah, you know what? You're going to thank me tomorrow. ",
        "Gus: I'm going to kick your butt right now, is what I'm going to do ",
        "Dinah: So this is what you're going to do? You're going to be angry at \r\nharley, you're going to be bitter. Is that your gig? Is that what you do? ",
        "Gus: You're okay with this? ",
        "Dinah: No. I'm not okay with this. I went crazy the first day i found out. \r\nBut I'm going to get through it. ",
        "Gus: Wow, good for you. Good for you, because I can't get through it. ",
        "Dinah: You know something? I bet you're going to surprise yourself. I've got \r\nthat feeling. ",
        "Gus: I rarely surprise myself. ",
        "Dinah: Hey, listen, look at it this way: In 70 years, you're going to be \r\ndead. ",
        "Gus: A little more so... that little nugget of knowledge, when did that take \r\nshape in your brain? ",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs ) honey, I think I've got a point. Would you agree? ",
        "Gus: So I should forgive and just forget it? ",
        "Dinah: Yeah. You forgive anyway. That's the deal. ",
        "Gus: Forgive anyway, like the poem. ",
        "Dinah: Look, harley and mallet, did they sleep together? Yeah, they did. All \r\nright. Will... will it make things worse when you look at the fact that, you \r\nknow, I don't know, they fell in love years ago and they were an item? Yeah, it \r\nmakes things hurt a lot more. But you were dead. You were dead and I was the new \r\nkid on the block. All right? And they could have made it work if they wanted it \r\nto, but they didn'T. Mallet chose me; harley chose you-- a dead you at that. I \r\nmean, that's got to mean something. ",
        "Gus: If I was gone, dead, the two of them would be a couple-- period, end of \r\nstory. ",
        "Reva: That girl liked you, and you weren't even paying attention. And even if \r\nshe's not your type, there's still something called being a gentleman. We like \r\nthat, too. So, as I was saying, you're trying to save my life. I'm just trying \r\nto return the favor. ",
        "Colin: By getting me a date? ",
        "Reva: That could be harder than you getting rid of my cancer. So yeah. ",
        "Josh: Dr. Mccabe is still unavailable then? ",
        "Reva: That's josh. That's josh. He's supposed to be away. ",
        "Colin: Well, maybe the gods are trying to tell you something. ",
        "Reva: No, this can't be happening. The groundbreaking, I can't ruin that for \r\nhim. ",
        "Colin: Here we go... ",
        "Reva: Just get rid of him for me. ",
        "Colin: These games you're playing with your husband, they're not going to...\r\n",
        "Reva: Save the lesson for later, would you please? Just do this for me. I \r\npromise I won't ask you again. ",
        "Colin: Don't make promises you can't keep. ",
        "Josh: Oh, hey. Dr. Mccabe, josh lewis. We met before. Is there someplace we \r\ncan talk in private? Can we just step inside here? ",
        "Lizzie: What do you want me to do? ",
        "Jonathan: Tell the D.A. You gave her daughter the booze. ",
        "Lizzie: No one is going to believe that. ",
        "Jonathan: You can be very convincing. ",
        "Lizzie: Okay, and what if doris wolfe comes after me? ",
        "Jonathan: You're a spaulding. You'll get off. ",
        "Lizzie: I'm not having this baby in a prison ward. ",
        "Jonathan: I'm not going to jail for something that's your fault! ",
        "Lizzie: You got involved with ashlee on your own! I had nothing to do with \r\nthat! Okay, I could lose coop if I do this. ",
        "Jonathan: Let me spell it out for you: You will lose coop if you don'T. ",
        "Lizzie: This isn't going to work! I'm going to get caught! Mom, it's me. \r\nThings... things are really bad, and I need your help. ",

        "Harley: It was awful, but we left the cabin, and he really kicked the drugs.\r\n",
        "Rick: Well, are you absolutely positive he stopped taking the drugs? ",
        "Harley: Yes. ",
        "Rick: Are you sure? ",
        "Harley: Because I could see it in his eyes. I can tell when he's high. It's \r\njust that things got complicated after we left the island. ",
        "Rick: Is that when he started taking them again? ",
        "Harley: Yeah, I can'T... i can't talk about why. ",
        "Rick: All right. ",
        "Harley: But we came home, he moved out, won't let me near him. So this is \r\nwhere you come in. ",
        "Rick: I don't know what I can do. If gus doesn't want help... ",
        "Harley: Help him! Can't you lock him up? You're a doctor. I don't care what \r\nyou do. You've got to get him off those drugs, rick. ",
        "Rick: Okay, I'll give it my best shot. ",
        "Harley: You have to do more than that. You owe me. ",
        "Rick: Harley, I will do everything I can. I will not let you down this time. \r\nYou can count on me. ",
        "Harley: Because I don't have anywhere else to turn, and neither does gus. ",
        "Dinah: Okay, okay, all right, you know what? Gus, you have had enough. Give \r\nme the coffee. Give me the coffee. Let me tell you something. You can play the \r\nwhat-ifs if you want for the rest of your life, but that's pointless. Mallet \r\nchose me, harley chose you, if you let her be with you. And if anyone makes that \r\nmistake, that's just going to be you, you alone. ",
        "Gus: Well, first, I didn't push anybody away. I just can't take the idea of \r\nhim. It's driving me crazy, mallet in my brain. ",
        "Dinah: Honey, it's very difficult because you're dwelling on it, and right \r\nnow you're drunk. You're drunk, and it's hard because you're thinking about it, \r\nbut tomorrow you're going to be sober and you can try. ",
        "Gus: I'll be sober tomorrow? ",
        "Dinah: Yes. ",
        "Gus: She... slept with him. Anybody but him... I could handle anybody but \r\nhim. Oh! ",
        "Dinah: I know. I know. I understand. ",
        "Gus: Do you? Do you? ",
        "Dinah: Yeah. You know how difficult it was for me to finally accept what i \r\naccept? ",
        "Colin: Uh, uh... there's a patient inside. ",
        "Josh: Oh, okay. ",
        "Colin: What did you want to talk to me about? ",
        "Josh: Actually, the rehab center and hospital for veterans that we spoke \r\nabout. I was wondering if you might be interested in coming on board as a \r\nconsultant? ",
        "Colin: Consultant? ",
        "Josh: Yeah. ",
        "Colin: Oh, well, yeah, i don't think I'd have the time, josh. My practice is \r\nvery busy. ",
        "Josh: I'll tell you what, let me buy you a cup of coffee and try to talk you \r\ninto it. How's that? ",
        "Colin: Well, I suppose I have time for a cup of coffee. ",
        "Josh: Great. ",
        "Beth: Lizzie, what is it? What's wrong? ",
        "Lizzie: Jonathan. He's trying to ruin my life. What tammy sees in him, I have \r\nno idea. ",
        "Beth: Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Stress is not good for the baby. So just \r\nbreathe and tell me what's wrong. ",
        "Lizzie: I am going to lose coop. And everything was going so well, but I'm \r\nreally going to lose him. ",
        "Beth: Honey, you have to calm down. And just tell me clearly what's going on.\r\n",
        "Lizzie: Not here. ",
        "Jonathan: Whoa, what is all of this? ",
        "Tammy: A diversion, and also sort of an apology. ",
        "Jonathan: You don't owe me an apology. ",
        "Tammy: I really wanted to help you with your case. I just couldn't think of \r\nany ideas. ",
        "Jonathan: Hey, don't worry about it. I have enough ideas for both of us. ",
        "Tammy: You do? We shouldn'T... not here. ",
        "Jonathan: Well, your mom isn't home. Who is going to know? ",
        "Tammy: Hey. Come on. ( Laughter ) ",
        "Beth: Lizzie, I don't understand why you're worried about jonathan. How is he \r\ngoing to do anything to ruin you and coop? ",
        "Lizzie: My god, it is such a mess! I am supposed to be building a life with \r\ncoop, and everywhere i go, it's jonathan, jonathan, jonathan. He's everywhere! \r\nHe's everywhere that I go. ",
        "Beth: Honey, you're not making any sense. ",
        "Lizzie: It doesn't make any sense. Everything is wrong. Coop should be the \r\nfather of my baby. ",
        "Beth: Wait a minute. You mean he isn't? ",
        "Lizzie: No. Jonathan is. ",
