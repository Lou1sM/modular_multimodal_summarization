        "Edmund: Yes, I know. Yes, I know. I don't care. I need delivery of that package today. Its contents are vital to the operation I have in place.",
        "Cassie: You look different.",
        "Edmund: I am?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. All I know is that cell phone that's been permanently attached to your ear these days.",
        "Edmund: Oh, I guess I do have more business than usual.",
        "Cassie: San Cristobel business?",
        "Edmund: All kinds of business.",
        "Cassie: Well, then I'll do my best not to distract you.",
        "Edmund: Now, now, now...",
        "Cassie: Or not.",
        "Edmund: Now, now, now, I know how distracting you are. And trust me, I am not going to let you get in my way.",
        "Josh: You know, I just don't want bill to feel like we're hovering over him.",
        "Billy: We are hovering. I mean, he's like a freight train that's been derailed-- doesn't sleep, doesn't eat. I want to head him off before he meets with our best client.",
        "Josh: He's got to ease back. He's just... you know, he's mourning Eden. Oh, my goodness. Look what we have here. Don't tell me you're here because of the Johnson meeting, please. You're a mess.",
        "Bill: Well, nice to see you, too, Uncle Josh. Now, since when have you been chaperoning my deals?",
        "Billy: You look like you slept in your car.",
        "Bill: I do not. I'm just getting myself...",
        "Billy: What about a clean shirt?",
        "Bill: What are you talking about? This is my cleanest dirty shirt. All right. Well, thanks for the input, but I don't need you guys around today. Thanks a lot.",
        "Billy: Whoa, whoa, whoa.",
        "Josh: Wait a minute.",
        "Billy: Take a deep breath. You come with me. Let's talk for a second.",
        "Danny: Go ahead.",
        "Jeffrey: So Vinnie's finally got the stones to press a button on me.",
        "Danny: Yeah, he wants you dead. And I thought Vinnie and I had nothing in common.",
        "Jeffrey: Why now?",
        "Danny: He wants to clear the decks before they meet with the supplier from San Cristobel. Besides, now's as good a time as any for you to take a dirtnap.",
        "Jeffrey: You're loving this, aren't you?",
        "Danny: Hey, you had no problem serving me up. It's your time to step up to the plate. You've got proof that Vinnie put the hit out on Eden, and now with you.",
        "Jeffrey: He's after a federal agent.",
        "Danny: That's right. It should be good for a lot of years. With Vinnie, everything's personal. And now you're personal with him.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, the feeling's mutual. So how does he want it done?",
        "Danny: With a bullet.",
        "Jeffrey: And who's the triggerman?",
        "Danny: You're talking to him.",
        "Bill: Hey, barkeep. Could I get a martini straight up? If you've got a sipping bottle, it would be great. If you've got a bib, it would be even greater.",
        "Billy: Sorry I'm stepping on your feet, boy, but look, you've got a big, important meeting, and you're a mess.",
        "Bill: Dad, this guy Johnson I'm meeting with, he's got three office complexes he wants built, and I'm his man.",
        "Billy: Of course you are. You're half his age, you're scruffy. You're just the kind of guy that a man wants to give a multimillion dollar contract to. Now, come on. Give me that. Thank you. All right.",
        "Tammy: Hi, Billy.",
        "Billy: You're looking more and more like your mom every day.",
        "Tammy: Thank you, I guess.",
        "Billy: Yeah.",
        "Tammy: Well, hey, this must be my lucky day.",
        "Billy: Why is that?",
        "Tammy: Mom's always saying you're one of the most generous guys she's ever met.",
        "Billy: Oh, generous? That's going to cost me some money, isn't it? You're much too old to be selling girl scout cookies, so...",
        "Tammy: I'm trying to win a contest for an intern position at Spaulding.",
        "Billy: People are competing to hang out at Spaulding, huh? Well, that's interesting. Who roped you into that?",
        "Tammy: Oh, it was Lizzie's idea. But all the kids are doing it.",
        "Billy: Oh, I see. Well, that's peachy. Well, what'll ten bucks buy me?",
        "Tammy: How about a hundred?",
        "Billy: A hundred? Geez. Okay.",
        "Tammy: Oh. One ticket for a drawing at the San Cristobel festival. Thank you.",
        "Billy: All right. Well, good luck, girl. Hey. You clean up good.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, thank you. You've got to ask yourself, \"How could I ever have doubted my son bill? Such a capable young man.\" You want to stick around and watch?",
        "Billy: No, I think I'll just come in for a second, and then I'm going to leave it up to you and Josh.",
        "Bill: All right. All right. I've just got to get one shot before I go, because... I'm kidding.",
        "Harley: Okay.",
        "Edmund: I appreciate you doing me this favor. Any problem getting the mail bag?",
        "Brad: Your people turned it over straight from customs.",
        "Edmund: Well, the rest of what you'll need you'll find right in here.",
        "Bill: Well, Johnson's not here yet?",
        "Josh: Bill, you know, I've been thinking about it. I'm not sure that you should be taking this meeting.",
        "Bill: Well, now, there's a decisive executive decision if I ever heard one. You either want me in or you don't.",
        "Josh: You shouldn't be here. You should go home.",
        "Bill: Josh, what am I going to be doing, sitting home and grieving?",
        "Josh: Dealing with your grief, yeah.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, I'm fine, all right? What, you don't think I can cut it anymore?",
        "Josh: That's not the issue, bill. I know you can cut it. But you've been through a traumatic experience. You're dealing with Eden's death. You've got big business issues here. Maybe I should help you out on this one.",
        "Bill: Don't worry about it. I'm fine. I'm fine, all right? Hold that thought.",
        "Billy: Call me when it's over, okay?",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Bill: Mr. Johnson, good to see you.",
        "Johnson: Bill, you're looking fit.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, thanks. You can still take me on the golf course, I'm sure.",
        "Johnson: Yeah. Josh, you've got your big wheel working with me today, huh?",
        "Josh: Craig, it's great to see you. Yeah. You know, bill's been on point on this one.",
        "Johnson: I like what I've seen thus far.",
        "Bill: All right, then. Let's grab ourselves a seat, have a drink, and I'll dazzle you a little more.",
        "Phillip: Honey, you're absolutely right, and I think it sounds like a wonderful idea.",
        "Bill: Well, I just want you to know this, Craig. The numbers are solid. The numbers are solid, we'll bring in two crews, no charge up front, then you can move in, start work. We'll bring three more crews in, and you can pick up the rest of the...",
        "Johnson: Well, that's very generous, but josh and your father don't like to commit unless there's 60% of the total cost already in the bank. Josh, do you have a problem with any of this?",
        "Bill: All right, here's the thing. You've been working with us for ten years now. We want to do you a service, okay? You're just on the hook for one thing.",
        "Johnson: Here it comes.",
        "Bill: Right here, right now, give lewis construction the contract for the manufacturing plant you've got slated for 2006. Inflation, we're going to ignore it. We're going to do both jobs, same rate.",
        "Johnson: Well, that would save us a lot of money.",
        "Bill: You bet it will save you a lot of money, all right? And know this-- lewis construction will not go broke.",
        "Josh: Bill, Bill, Craig and I have already discussed this. Now, I don't want to push you into anything.",
        "Johnson: Are you going to be overseeing all of this, bill?",
        "Bill: I'm going to be running the show from the first shovel of dirt to cutting the ribbon.",
        "Johnson: Then we have a deal.",
        "Bill: All right. That's what I like to hear.",
        "Johnson: Josh, you and Billy have a good man here.",
        "Josh: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Johnson: Don't let me hire him away from you.",
        "Josh: Okay. Thanks, Craig. You take care, now.",
        "Bill: You should see the look on your face.",
        "Josh: Your grandfather would be proud of you.",
        "Tammy: Fellows, this is your lucky day.",
        "Josh: Is that right? Well, Tammy, what's going on?",
        "Tammy: I'm trying to win an internship at Spaulding by selling tickets to the San Cristobel festival.",
        "Bill: Really? Well, lewis construction loves a charitable donation tax write- off. How much?",
        "Tammy: Well, if you're buying for your business, I could just sell you everything I've got.",
        "Bill: Well, that sounds like a hustle to me.",
        "Tammy: Lizzie is in this contest, too, and I bet she's just going to buy all her own tickets so she can win.",
        "Bill: Okay. Now, are you a Spaulding, or are you a Winslow?",
        "Tammy: Oh, is this a lecture coming? \"Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps,\" or something? Come on, bill. You can afford it.",
        "Bill: All right, girlie, but you can't. Sit down. Now, be a businesswoman, all right? Not a con artist. Do you want to work for what you get, or do you want everything handed to you on a silver platter?",
        "Tammy: Handed to me sounds nice.",
        "Bill: No, you want to work for it. Why? Because it's the only way you can hold your head up in the world. And it's the only way you're going to know what you're truly capable of achieving. Let me tell you something, Tammy. That way victory is so much sweeter. I mean, you want to be on the baby bottle the rest of your life? No.",
        "Tammy: Sounds pretty pathetic.",
        "Bill: Yeah, doesn't it? You're going to be a loser. Sometimes you've got to stand up and ask for the ball, even demand it. Wouldn't you agree with that, uncle josh?",
        "Josh: Actually, I would.",
        "Bill: Okay. All right. All right, this is what I'm going to do. I'm going to buy two tickets right now, okay? But whatever legit sales you make by the end of the day, I'm going to match it, in honor of my granddaddy, H.B.",
        "Tammy: Oh, wow. Thank you.",
        "Bill: Yeah. Well, just remember this-- keep it legit.",
        "Tammy: I will.",
        "Bill: All right. I love helping the kids. You've got that look on your face again.",
        "Josh: Do you have any idea how much you're your mother's son right now?",
        "Bill: I don't know.",
        "Josh: Vanessa has a great head for business.",
        "Bill: Some of us have it like that.",
        "Josh: You're a natural.",
        "Bill: Are just seeing that now?",
        "Salerno: So what is it? You don't like the way I'm running things, or what?",
        "Danny: No, Vinnie, come on. You know it's not that. It's just that I have this hit on O'Neill all worked out.",
        "Salerno: Look, I'm trying to protect you, all right? You're still working your way back into the life. Your wife is in the hospital. Why get blood on your hands?",
        "Danny: For one thing-- to prove my loyalty.",
        "Salerno: I like that. Look, you've one done one hit for me before, right? This is a biggie. I need it done right.",
        "Danny: Vinnie, I know I'm not your right hand man. I know that. But I could be, for this. Let me do this. I promise you I'll get it right.",
        "Salerno: You really want this?",
        "Danny: Has there ever been someone you wanted to take out, that you just had to take out? Believe me, after what O'Neill did to me, this would be a pleasure.",
        "Salerno: You and I are a lot alike, my friend. We take things personally.",
        "Danny: Thanks for the complement.",
        "Salerno: Yeah, well, don't let it go to your head. You got the job.",
        "Edmund: Hello?",
        "Bill: What are you going to do, huh? You going to kill me, huh?",
        "Salerno: You came through for me, mar. Ambassador.",
        "Phillip: Sharing this office with Lizzie is a very, very nice gesture.",
        "Olivia: Well, you just want one big, happy family. I'll do my part.",
        "Lizzie: That's so sweet of you, Olivia. I just wish that...",
        "Phillip: Honey, what it?",
        "Lizzie: Nothing. It just makes me so happy when I see things work out.",
        "Phillip: Huh?",
        "Olivia: What about this office?",
        "Phillip: I love you, honey.",
        "Lizzie: You can keep it.",
        "Phillip: You know what? I've been neglecting you.",
        "Olivia: I don't feel neglected, sweetheart.",
        "Phillip: Oh, come on. I know how much attention you need. You need almost as much as Emma. And I want to do something about that. And I'm not talking about our marriage. I'm talking about our business relationship.",
        "Olivia: Well, then, you're going to have to get this office situation worked out.",
        "Phillip: Oh, now, arguing about little things is just a waste of time, because we want the same thing. We want the health of Spaulding enterprises. And that's what I came here to talk to you about today.",
        "Olivia: Am I in trouble?",
        "Phillip: I want to give you access to everything, even the things that I was working on before I got sick.",
        "Olivia: Well, that's a really big step, Phillip.",
        "Phillip: I think we need to trust each other without reservation. So I brought you this. It's a confidential memo about a very important deal that we're working.",
        "Olivia: The pharmaceutical division. Antimonius, right?",
        "Phillip: Don't say anything to Alex. She runs that division like a secret society, but it's a huge moneymaker. I just want you to take a look at it. And if you have any ideas about increasing marketing or sales, tell me, and we'll work on it together.",
        "Olivia: I don't know what to say. Thank you for putting so much trust in me.",
        "Phillip: Well, I want you to feel the same way about me. But be very careful with those. Keep them safe. They're for your eyes only.",
        "Billy: You turned out to be a real lewis, boy.",
        "Bill: And a chamberlain too, according to Uncle Josh here.",
        "Josh: I underestimated you again. I'm sorry. I won't do it anymore, as long as you promise not to continue freaking me out with the way you do business. Otherwise, I'm going to have to start drinking.",
        "Billy: So my boy threw you for a loop, huh?",
        "Josh: Yes, he did. Reminds me a little bit of you, as a matter of fact. He can be a real mess, and then five minutes later close a multimillion dollar deal. Listen, Bill, I'm worried about you, but you did well today.",
        "Bill: All right. Well, does that mean I stop proving myself to you?",
        "Josh: Yeah. Sort of.",
        "Bill: Sort of.",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Bill: All right. All right.",
        "Josh: We'll see you. All right, man. Bye-bye.",
        "Billy: Thanks. Whoa, hey.",
        "Tony: How are you doing, Bill?",
        "Bill: Took a lot of guts going to Eden's funeral.",
        "Tony: Well, I was invited by you. Last I remember, you had a gun pointed at my head, and Olivia stopped you from doing whatever it was you were going to do. You and me were cool, right? Last I remember.",
        "Bill: You told me how bad you felt for me, how sorry you were that she was dead, meanwhile laughing at me behind my back, huh? Trying to muster up all that phony sympathy.",
        "Tony: How much have you had to drink already, bill?",
        "Bill: Yeah. You lied to me about Eden.",
        "Tony: What's the matter with you? I didn't lie about anything. Look, all I know is Eden's a good girl. You guys were great together.",
        "Bill: Yeah? Were you good with her, too? Were you good with her, too?",
        "Tony: What are you talking about?",
        "Bill: She's dead. You didn't think anyone was going to find out, huh? But I did. You slept with my girl.",
        "Tony: You're losing it, man, I'm telling you. Look, I never slept with Eden. But I will say at one point I...",
        "Bill: Why don't you admit it? Why don't you admit it? Why don't you admit that you did? Admit it to me. You and your cousin, that's all you do. All you do is lie.",
        "Tony: It's funny.",
        "Bill: Well, here's the thing. I knew. The way you're always hanging around. The way you were always uncomfortable with each other. Give me a break, Tony. I was going to call you on it the other day, but you stopped me. I don't know. Maybe for once I did want to believe you, but...",
        "Tony: Part of you believes it wasn't true.",
        "Bill: Own up to it. Own up to it. You and Eden, you both played me for a sucker.",
        "Tony: All right, you know something? Look, I've told you the truth. You don't want to believe me, that's not my problem, that's yours. But Eden's dead, okay? So you let her rest in peace, you hear me? You're lucky.",
        "Bill: What are you going to do, huh?",
        "Tony: You're lucky.",
        "Bill: What are you going to do? You going to kill me, huh? Is that what you mob guys do? You kill me, huh? Just like Eden.",
        "Tony: You know something, bill? One, you're not worth it. Two, you've lost your mind. And let me tell you something, okay? I suggest you get your life together and your mind straightened out, or your life could end, just like Eden's.",
        "Bill: Yours could, too.",
        "Lizzie: Joey, we have tickets to sell. Let's go. Well, I already hit up everybody here, so, I mean, you wouldn't want to make a fool of yourself by begging, would you? Come on, Joey. Let's go.",
        "Olivia: You know, I'm surprised that you trust me with such sensitive material. Honestly, I didn't think that you trusted me at all.",
        "Phillip: Well, we've been through a very bad time, the two of us. I trust you. You know that.",
        "Olivia: Thank you.",
        "Phillip: This company is our daughter's future. It's her legacy. If we let it go down the tubes, we'll have nothing but regrets about what might have been.",
        "Olivia: I just can't believe you're really working with me like this.",
        "Phillip: Well, I think with your instincts and my knowledge of the business, I think we're unstoppable. I'd be a fool not to take advantage of you. Just think what we might be able to do together.",
        "Olivia: I used to do that all the time.",
        "Phillip: I'm setting up meetings for you with all the principal board members.",
        "Olivia: Well, that would certainly show them that I have your support.",
        "Phillip: Oh, it'll do a lot more than that. It'll tell them that when you talk they'd better listen. Because I want you fully briefed on everything. I want you go get credit for everything that you've done.",
        "Olivia: My head is spinning right now. I mean, come on. You have to know that this is something that I've always wanted.",
        "Phillip: Well, I'm not giving you anything. I'll clear the way for you, but once you're there, you'll have to do the rest for yourself. So look at all of that. Learn it. Because I do want you to know about all of it.",
        "Olivia: I'll look at it first chance I get.",
        "Phillip: Okay. Just make sure that you do keep it in a safe place.",
        "Olivia: I can't tell you how happy this makes me.",
        "Phillip: Well, okay. Don't you have a meeting to be getting ready for?",
        "Olivia: Right. I'll just... I'll put these away for...",
        "Phillip: Okay.",
        "Olivia: Are you hanging around?",
        "Phillip: You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to make a few calls from here, and then I'm going to head home, okay?",
        "Olivia: Yeah. You still need your rest.",
        "Phillip: You're still thinking about me. I don't know how you do it.",
        "Olivia: Deep, abiding love.",
        "Phillip: Right back at you. So predictable. Alan? Yeah, it's done. She's got the memos. She's sticking her head in the noose. Are you kidding me? She was practically salivating when I told her she was going to have free rein around here. Yeah. I'll let you know. Good-bye, Olivia.",
        "Jeffrey: Shall we find a potted plant to hide behind?",
        "Harley: Why, are you flirting with me? No, I saw something just now. I saw Edmund Winslow deliver something to Brad Greene. It was a mailbag, like a diplomatic pouch.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Well, who got what?",
        "Harley: Edmund handed something to brad from the bag, and then took something for himself.",
        "Jeffrey: Since when did Brad Greene become a diplomatic courier?",
        "Harley: My thoughts exactly. And since we like him for the antimonius connection, and his wife thinks Brad's spending way too much time down in San Cristobel, now he's making a drop with the ambassador of San Cristobel? Come on.",
        "Jeffrey: I don't know. It seems a little circumstantial to me.",
        "Harley: Well, it's a puzzle, yes. All the pieces fit, though. We just don't know how yet.",
        "Jeffrey: When did he go back upstairs?",
        "Attendant: Sorry, I wasn't...",
        "Tony: You're threatening my life now, bill? Is that it? Better watch what you're doing, because I might have to do something about that.",
        "Bill: Well, I don't care what you do.",
        "Tony: Just like I don't care what people say to you. Nothing happened with me and your fianc\u00e9e. Do you understand that? If you're so in love with her, as you say you are, why would you let me within 100 feet of her? If you're so threatened by me, why would you keep her...",
        "Bill: Maybe I was...",
        "Tony: Why bring it up now? She loved you, bill. You guys were meant to be together. She was faithful to you. Do you understand that? Comprehend? What are you going to do now?",
        "Bill: Because all I know is this-- you and your cousin, yeah, you are going down, and I'm going to do whatever it takes to make that happen.",
        "Tony: Guess I should watch my back now, right?",
        "Bill: That's it. That's it. I am not playing by the rules anymore.",
