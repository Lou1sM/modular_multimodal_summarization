        "Ashlee: I did what I had to do.",
        "Lizzie: What does that mean?",
        "Ashlee: Look, all I know is that I need to get Tammy away from Jonathan so that he'll realize that he has feelings for me. And I'm pretty sure whatever you're hiding about your pregnancy will help me do that.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, Ashlee, no offense. But you're delusional. Jonathan is never going to leave Tammy for you. You should just forget about him and stop screwing up my life and my kid's life! Ashlee? Hello? You are not going to ruin this for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Ashlee's telling the truth, isn't she?",
        "Jonathan: No, Ashlee's nuts. I never should have taken her to the prom, because...",
        "Tammy: I believe her.",
        "Jonathan: What?",
        "Tammy: I believe her. I think you're scared about something, something in this file. The real reason you took Ashlee to the prom. You can tell me, Jonathan, you can tell me anything.",
        "Jonathan: I did tell you. Ashlee's off her rocker.",
        "Tammy: What's in here, Jonathan?",
        "Jonathan: Nothing! Nothing!",
        "Tammy: Things are so good between us. Don't do this again.",
        "Jonathan: Do what?",
        "Tammy: Keep secrets. Thinking like you have to handle everything on your own. You're not alone, Jonathan, you have me.",
        "Jonathan: And I want to be with you forever. Come on, come on. Let's go, let's-- get on my bike right now and we'll go someplace else, like you said. We'll go to San Francisco. We can start fresh.",
        "Tammy: We can't just leave. You have your hearing today.",
        "Jonathan: So what?",
        "Tammy: So, you have charges pending against you. You can't leave the state.",
        "Jonathan: I don't care about that.",
        "Tammy: I do.",
        "Jonathan: Look. The only reason Doris Wolfe is prosecuting me is because she wants me away from her daughter, out of this town. So let's just give her what she wants, okay? Let's just... come on. You and me. We'll go away, no rules, no people breathing down our neck. Come on, please. Say yes.",
        "Tammy: Okay. If you wanna leave, we'll leave.",
        "Jonathan: ( Sighs ) Okay.",
        "Tammy: Right after you tell me the truth about this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Patient: Dr. Bauer? What on earth is going on? I took Bobby to the E.R. last night, another seizure. The nurses wouldn't page you.",
        "Rick: Mrs. Federov. I'm sorry. My offices were actually supposed to contact you. I'm not working at Cedars anymore. Actually, my pediatric cases are being handled by-- ( snaps fingers )-- Dr. Macmillan.",
        "Patient: But we don't want another doctor. We like you. We trust you.",
        "Rick: Listen, I really appreciate that, but Dr. Macmillan's a fine doctor. So if you'll excuse me...",
        "Leah: Oh, daddy. You're a mess.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mel: Okay, People V. Jordan, 1987, uh... prosecutor claimed the defendant was intoxicated with--",
        "Jeffrey: Wow, maybe I should have spent more time on this case. It seemed simple enough to me.",
        "Mel: I just like to do my homework.",
        "Jeffrey: Did you use a label maker?",
        "Mel: Excuse me? It's called preparation. It's the sign of an organized mind.",
        "Jeffrey: Or the sign of someone who's trying to get her mind off of something else.",
        "Mel: This is not about Rick.",
        "Jeffrey: I didn't say it was.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Well?",
        "Jonathan: Look. Everything that I do, I do it for us. To protect us. I know I've made some mistakes in the past, and I know that I'm going make some mistakes again--",
        "Tammy: Oh, this is bad. Isn't it?",
        "Jonathan: No.",
        "Tammy: Then just tell me. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Jonathan: I have to take that.",
        "Tammy: No, you don't.",
        "Jonathan: Uh, yeah, I do. It's Mel. My lawyer, remember?",
        "Tammy: ( Sighs )",
        "Jonathan: Hello.",
        "Mel: Jonathan, it's Mel. I'm at the courthouse, and I just ran into Doris Wolfe. She is on the warpath. So do not-- I repeat-- do not come down here.",
        "Jonathan: I thought I had to be there today.",
        "Mel: Not for this hearing. Not until she cools off. I want to keep this as impersonal as possible, so-- uh, you know what, I have to go. I'll let you know how it goes.",
        "Tammy: You don't have to go over there?",
        "Jonathan: No, she said to stay away. Mel probably doesn't trust me, imagine that. But... so can we leave now?",
        "Tammy: No, Jonathan, we're not running away. Just tell me what this is all about. Tell me what Lizzie's medical file has to do with us.",
        "Jonathan: It's nothing. It's no big deal. Where are you going? What are you doing?",
        "Tammy: If you're not gonna tell me what this is about, then I'm just gonna go find Ashlee and ask her.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy, don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Oh, my God. What did Ashlee tell you? Please, I can explain everything!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Can we just--can we talk about it later-- ( cell phone ringing )",
        "Josh: Just wait for a second, all right? This is Reva. Hold on. Hey, sweetheart. You having a good time with R.J.? What? When? No, I'm standing here with Cassie right now. Yeah, we'll make a couple of phone calls and-- okay. Listen, don't panic! I'm sure it's fine. Okay.",
        "Cassie: Don't panic?",
        "Josh: Cassie, R.J. isn't with Reva right now. Apparently he took off for some reason.",
        "Cassie: What do you mean he took off?",
        "Josh: Well, he's just not there, and she's called Frank Cooper already, so the police are on it, but I think--",
        "Cassie: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.",
        "Josh: No, no, listen, listen.",
        "Cassie: Well, where would he go? He doesn't just walk out.",
        "Josh: Well, he's a kid, you know, kids do funny things. They hear an ice cream truck down the block and they go running out of the house. Look, I think the best thing for us to do right now is for you to get me back to the car.",
        "Cassie: He's not answering.",
        "Josh: We'll go to the house, we'll wait for him there. I'm sure he'll come walking in. He'll tell us some great boy story about an adventure he was on.",
        "Cassie: You think?",
        "Josh: It's going to be okay, Cassie. I promise. Come here, it's gonna be okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Thank God.",
        "Colin: Hey, I got your message. What's going on?",
        "Reva: My nephew, R.J.. Cassie's son. I was watching him, and I-- he's missing.",
        "Colin: Wait, your nephew?",
        "Reva: Yeah.",
        "Colin: You gave me the impression that this was a medical emergency.",
        "Reva: It was. Sort of.",
        "Colin: I just canceled an appointment with another patient to come over here. So we're clear from here on in, Reva? I'm not your--your confidante. I'm certainly not your babysitter. I'm your Oncologist.",
        "Reva: But you know what, you're the only one who knows I'm sick.",
        "Colin: Well, that's your decision, not mine. And you know how I feel about it.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well you know what? You are a part of this. You know why? Because you're the only one who knows why this happened. It's because of all the drugs you're pumping into my body. The chemo made me sick, and I had to race off to the bathroom while I was watching R.J., and when I got back, he was gone.",
        "Colin: Well, that's terrible. But it has nothing to do with me.",
        "Reva: Well, you know what, it does. Because the sad fact is, right now, you're all I got.",
        "Colin: Reva, you have a husband and a family who would very gladly support you if you would just give them half a chance. You can't keep leaning on me like this. It's just not appropriate.",
        "Reva: Since when have I ever cared about anything being appropriate?",
        "Colin: Well, never, apparently, but I do. And I have a very full schedule.",
        "Reva: Yeah, I thought you were working on that bedside manner.",
        "Colin: You look awful.",
        "Reva: Yeah, hey, thanks.",
        "Colin: If you felt this bad, why did you agree to babysit your nephew?",
        "Reva: Because I had to do something. It was family, okay? They needed me. My son Jonathan's going on trial today, and now he's got some girl pregnant. He's the father; he doesn't even want to acknowledge the child. And now I may not even get to know my own grandchild, okay? So, everything is falling apart, everything. And I thought, babysitting R.J., well, that's something I can do. I can do that. But now I...",
        "Colin: Why don't you come back to the hospital with me and let me check you out?",
        "Reva: Oh, why? So you can lecture me again? Tell me how I'm doing everything wrong? I don't think so. Just go back to your other patients, and I'm sorry I bothered you. It won't happen again.",
        "Colin: All right. This kid R.J., tell me a few places he might go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: I'm just going to grab something out of my car.",
        "Cassie: Josh, hold on a second.",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Cassie: Just thank you for being here. I feel like I'd be losing my mind right now if you weren't here.",
        "Josh: It's going to be okay, Cassie. It is, I promise you. We're gonna find R.J.. why don't you call him again on the cell phone.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, exactly.",
        "Josh: Maybe he'll pick up this time.",
        "Cassie: This is exactly why I got this for him, for emergencies. Pick up, pick up, pick up. ( Cell phone ringing from inside car )",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Cassie: Is that coming-- R.J.?",
        "Josh: R.J.!",
        "Cassie: R.J., R.J..",
        "Josh: Hey!",
        "R.J.: Mom. What are you doing here?",
        "Cassie: What am I doing here?! What are you doing here?",
        "Josh: You're in my car, young man. I mean, not that we're upset about that or anything, but...",
        "R.J.: I got sleepy.",
        "Cassie: Oh, sweetie. I have never been so relieved in my entire life.",
        "Josh: That makes two of us. See, I can actually remember the days when children would be afraid to talk to their parents like that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Leah: Dad, come on. It's not like I don't know what's going on with you. You're a train wreck. You miss your work and you miss mom.",
        "Rick: What do you mean, sweetie?",
        "Leah: Don't bother. You're sleeping on the couch. I know what that means.",
        "Rick: And it means that your dad has a bad back, and I'm sleeping--",
        "Leah: Dad.",
        "Rick: ( Sighs ) Would you believe the bed bugs?",
        "Leah: Nope.",
        "Rick: Man. Yeah, there was a time, sweetheart, you used to believe everything I used to tell you. Remember the dirty sock fairy? Remember that?",
        "Leah: I still have nightmares about that guy. ( Laughing )",
        "Rick: All grown up. Well, I guess this boarding school has gotten you to a place where your father's going to have to start talking to you like an adult.",
        "Leah: Might be nice.",
        "Rick: Come here. Sweetie, I am so sorry that you had to come home to this.",
        "Leah: It's okay. Don't worry, I'm gonna fix it.",
        "Rick: Leah, don't get involved with this.",
        "Leah: I am... don't worry about it. You told me when I was little I can do anything I can put my mind to. Well, getting you and mom back together is the most important thing in the world to me. I'm going to fix it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: All right, the 14th or the 15th, which is best for you? Mel, 14th or 15th? Christmas? Easter? New Year's?",
        "Mel: Hmm?",
        "Jeffrey: You want me to write it on your label maker? \"The People V. Jonathan Randall.\"",
        "Mel: Oh. The 15th, Jeffrey, the 15th.",
        "Jeffrey: The 15th. Thank you.",
        "Mel: Yes, and I'll expect copies of the depositions by your office.",
        "Jeffrey: What are you talking-- you know, you're wearing me out here.",
        "Mel: Gee, sorry.",
        "Jeffrey: So this is how you deal with your troubles, huh? You just pour yourself into your work, hmm? That's so boring. You know, I always secretly hoped that you would have an affair or sleep around or something.",
        "Mel: Excuse me?",
        "Jeffrey: I'm serious. You know, you're just so neat and on top of it all the time. Sometimes it's a good thing to make a bad decision. Just go get drunk and, you know, wake up somewhere you don't know where you are.",
        "Mel: ( Laughing ) That is the single worst piece of advice I have ever gotten.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, consider the source. Let me try this. My campaign manager taught me this one. Um. How are you?",
        "Mel: Is that supposed to get you elected?",
        "Jeffrey: Not warm and fuzzy enough?",
        "Mel: No, just a little bit insincere.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, what if I told you that I really did want to know how you are.",
        "Mel: ( Sighs ) Well, then I would tell you that I'm worried about Rick. On the one hand, I am so angry with him, and on the other hand...",
        "Jeffrey: On the other hand, you're worried he might end up in one of these courtrooms.",
        "Mel: Charles Grant suspended him from the hospital.",
        "Jeffrey: Does that surprise you?",
        "Mel: I'm not defending him. Jeffrey:. Oh. Please, do. I mean, he is your husband.",
        "Mel: I just-- I can't stomach what he did. His loyalty to Phillip contributed to Ross' death. Even if it was an accident, I am so furious with him-- ( sighs ) and then, I picture him sitting in a jail cell, and... I can't bear it. And Leah and Jude, I mean, it would just totally destroy them.",
        "Jeffrey: And you.",
        "Mel: No matter what way I look at it, there's just no right answer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: That's mine. Ashlee gave this to you? I can't believe-- this is such a violation of my privacy.",
        "Tammy: I didn't look at it.",
        "Lizzie: You didn't? Oh.",
        "Tammy: But something in there has something to do with Jonathan. So I really wish that you both would just come clean!",
        "Jonathan: All right, I'll tell you what-- what's going on, but Lizzie stays out of this.",
        "Tammy: No, Lizzie's already in it. So... now don't all speak at once.",
        "Lizzie: She's right, Jonathan. She deserves to know the truth.",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie...",
        "Lizzie: So here it is. Jonathan was trying to do something nice for Ashlee when he took her to the prom. Only it backfired, because she has a thing for him, which I'm sure you already know. Um... but when he told her that the feeling wasn't mutual, she turned on him. Turned on him. She went to her mom and told... she told her mom that he got her drunk!",
        "Tammy: I know, I know all about that. I just don't know how that thing fits in.",
        "Lizzie: Jonathan was trying to find a way to beat the charges. He needed someone to stand up in court and swear that he hadn't given Ashlee the booze. So he came to me.",
        "Tammy: Why you?",
        "Lizzie: Because Ashlee told him something. She told him something that's in this file. And he knew that he could use it against me, that he could blackmail me with it. See, I went to the clinic that Ashlee works at for counseling. Because I thought I was going to get an abortion. I had the appointment scheduled and everything. I wasn't even going to tell Coop. Obviously, I didn't do it. But I was so scared that if Coop found out what I almost did, it would ruin everything between us.",
        "Tammy: So you used that against her. You threatened to tell Coop.",
        "Jonathan: I was desperate. I needed a witn--",
        "Tammy: I gotta go. I have to take a walk. I don't even know what I'm feeling right now.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy.",
        "Lizzie: Don't! We have way more important things to deal with. We have to find a way to shut Ashlee up. She is so close. If that freak puts two and two together and figures out we slept together... God, this is all your fault!",
        "Jonathan: My fault? You lied to me.",
        "Lizzie: No, I mean, what I just told Tammy-- that was the truth. I was scared that if Coop found out--",
        "Jonathan: No. No no no. Let's talk about the big lie. Let's talk about the lie that started this whole thing. And don't tell me that it's not true, because I know it is. That baby is mine. I am the father of that kid.",

        "Jonathan: Lizzie, Reva heard you.",
        "Lizzie: What?",
        "Jonathan: Reva heard you at the hospital tell your mother I am that kid's father.",
        "Lizzie: I think I'm gonna be sick.",
        "Jonathan: Well, welcome to the club.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. You're the father. And now you know. Big whoop. I mean, it's not like it's gonna change anything.",
        "Jonathan: Excuse me?",
        "Lizzie: You heard me. Do you think I want the world to know that I was stupid enough to get knocked up by you? I mean, you're not exactly father material. How many times have you been in and out of jail?",
        "Jonathan: Well, who do you think you are? Springfield's next mother of the year?",

        "Tammy: He didn't do it. He didn't, Remy. Ashlee Wolfe has it in for him. She made the whole thing up. It's true!",
        "Remy: Then why are you getting so worked up?",
        "Tammy: Because I am sick of everybody in this town always trying to pin everything bad that happens on Jonathan. None of you know him like I do. He's a good guy. And even when he does make mistakes, it's only because he's trying to protect and help the people that he loves.",

        "Jeffrey: Uh, Tammy. How's your mom doing?",

        "Mel: Okay. I'll talk to my client and then I'll get back to you. All right?",
        "Jeffrey: Mel, you should bag the coffee with your brother and get some rest. You're running on fumes.",
        "Mel: You sure you don't want me to get liquored up and stumble into your room, stammering something about making my husband pay for lying to me?",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, you really do need to get some RT. And you need to get to that husband of yours, fast. Go home.",
        "Mel: \"Go home.\" Yeah, that used to sound great to me. Now the house is filled with so much tension. I feel like I don't know my husband anymore. Who is this man who's willing to give up everything just to help a friend?",
        "Leah: Sounds like something my dad would do. Remember him? The guy you love? Mom, you're a lawyer. Dad, you need one. Come on, help each other out.",

        "Colin: Well, I just thought-- well, when I was his age I used to like to sneak off to the science museum and check out the new exhibits.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well. You're you. ( Cell phone rings ) Josh? Hi. Oh, thank God. And he's all right? Oh good, um... no no, I'll meet you back at home. And Bud? Thank you.",
        "Colin: The wayward child's been located?",
        "Reva: Yes, yes!",
        "Colin: All in one piece?",
        "Reva: Yeah, he was asleep in Josh's car the whole time.",
        "Colin: Well, looks like my work here is done, so... sure you don't want to come back to the hospital with me and get checked out? I think you should.",
        "Reva: No, I think I'll pass on that. I uh... I'm just tired, you know? I'm just really, really tired.",
        "Colin: Okay. Well, suit yourself. And uh, by the way? You're welcome.",
        "Reva: Oh by the way, you're welcome. You were almost human there for a moment, worrying about something other than your tests and your potions.",
        "Colin: Hey, well those tests and potions...",
        "Reva: I know. They're what's keeping me alive. And you just love having that kind of power over me, don't you?",
        "Colin: No, not particularly.",
        "Reva: Come on. You love it. You know what else you love? The fact that I'm leaning on you. The fact that you're the only one that knows that my body is turning against me. You get some kind of perversion out of helping me keep my secret.",
        "Colin: Actually, it's just the opposite. Your personal drama is an enormous drain on my time and energy. And I have more important things to do.",
        "Reva: Oh really? Like what? You don't date, and as far as I can tell, you don't have any friends, Doc. So come on, I'm entertaining, right? It's a good story. And it's only gonna get juicier and juicier by the moment, I mean-- because look, I'm barely standing upright. I had to cut my hair because it's coming out in fistfuls. I can't even take care of my own nephew without screwing it up. And can I get through to my son? Nope. In a nutshell, Doc, I'm a failure. As a woman, as a wife, and as a mother. I am a failure with a capital F. And not even you have the cure for that.",

        "Cassie: Come here. R.J.? Honey? You terrified me. You cannot run off like that without telling someone where you're going. You terrified me and your Aunt Reva and your Uncle josh. You have to promise me you will never do that again, okay?",
        "R.J.: Okay.",
        "Cassie: Okay.",
        "R.J.: Are you mad at me, Uncle Josh?",
        "Josh: What? No, champ, I am not mad at you, okay? But you are making me a little bit sleepy when you keep yawning like that. I'll tell you what, let's get you guys back to your house. Why don't you hop in your mom's car, it's right there.",
        "Cassie: I forgot how sleepy that cold medicine makes him.",
        "Josh: Are you okay?",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Josh: You're not okay. I promised you, right, just a few minutes ago that we would find him, and we did.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, you did. You're always there for me, Josh. I can always count on you.",
        "Josh: And I'll always be there for R.J., too. Whenever you guys need me. It's okay.",
        "Cassie: Um... actually, no. I don't think it's a good idea. I don't think it's a good idea. In fact, I think... I think it would be a good idea for you to keep your distance from us for a while.",
        "Josh: Cassie, have I offended you in some way?",
        "Cassie: No, God no. I just worry that if you keep spending time with me and R.J. that he'll depend on you like I do.",
        "Josh: And what exactly would be wrong with that?",
        "Cassie: Nothing, except that you're married to my sister.",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: And I mean, have a million obligations and a family of your own.",
        "Josh: Cassie, you're part of that family.",
        "Cassie: I know I am. But you have already done enough for me.",
        "Josh: No, now come on. You know that there's no such thing as enough when you're talking about doing something for someone you love. It doesn't work that way.",
        "Cassie: I don't want to disrupt your life.",
        "Josh: You're not disrupting my life in any way.",
        "Cassie: I need to stand on my own two feet. It has to go back to normal.",
        "Josh: I get that--",
        "Cassie: Things have to get back to normal.",
        "Josh: You know what? You are as stubborn as your sister. Why do you insist on going about things on your own?",
        "Cassie: Uh, because I am on my own.",
        "Josh: No...",
        "Cassie: That's the fact. I am alone. And I don't want R.J.--",
        "Josh: You don't want him to depend on me. Yeah, I get that. What I don't understand is the why.",
        "Cassie: Because I have put him through enough ups and downs in his life. He needs stability.",
        "Josh: Yeah, well that's exactly what I'm trying to give him, Cassie. And that's what I'm going to keep on giving him until the day I stop breathing, so what's the problem?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: You should not have lied to me, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, okay, well I did. So get over it. Why? Why would you want to rock the boat right now? You have Tammy. I have Coop. He's gonna be a great father. Everybody wins, just keep your mouth shut.",
        "Tammy: You're still here?",
        "Jonathan: She was just leaving.",
        "Tammy: And did you guys work everything out? Did he apologize to you?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. We reached an agreement. This is my problem. I'll deal with it. You're off the hook.",
        "Lizzie: I hope so. Look, I'm sure that you guys are gonna work this out and it's gonna be good. Better than good. It's gonna turn out great. Just like everything with me and Coop. Take care.",
        "Jonathan: So, on a scale of one to ten, how mad are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colin: You're determined to make your situation as difficult as possible, aren't you.",
        "Reva: \"Situation\"? Oh, you mean my cancer. I don't know how to make anything easy. I know that I'm gonna take care of my family and put them first. What happened with R.J. today, that scared the hell out of me.",
        "Colin: And breast cancer doesn't?",
        "Reva: I will not lose a grandchild, too. I'll do what has to be done.",
        "Colin: And what's that?",
        "Reva: I'm gonna have to knock some sense into my son.",

        "Mel: Leah, honey. I know you're just trying to make this right, okay? But it's not that simple.",
        "Leah: Seems pretty simple to me. I mean, dad messed up. I get that. But it's not like you haven't messed up before. Actually, come to think of it, you probably haven't, you're the perfect one in the family.",
        "Rick: Leah, please.",
        "Leah: At least you could think about what dad's been through. Or at least care enough to help clear his name so we can get back together and be a family again, and listen to dad's bad medical jokes at the dinner table.",
        "Mel: Leah. Look, I know-- I'm glad that you have said what you needed to say, okay? But this is between your father and I.",
        "Leah: No, it's not.",
        "Rick: Leah, you know what, I appreciate your support, sweetheart, but you need to stop this. Please.",
        "Leah: Does this mean you're not gonna help him? Is that what you're saying?",
        "Remy: Leah, let's grab a soda, give your folks some time alone, okay?",
        "Leah: Not until I get this straight. Let me make sure I understand. Basically, you're bailing on our family. Is that it?",
        "Mel: No, honey, I'm not bailing on anybody.",
        "Leah: You couldn't care less whether me and Jude have our father around. Being mad at him is more important to you.",
        "Rick: Leah, you can't blame your--",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Cassie, you... look, you're missing the point. Okay, R.J. depends on me, that's exactly how it's supposed to be. That's how I want it to be. I'm his Uncle. In fact, I'm the closest thing he's had to a father figure that he's had since, what, Richard died!",
        "Cassie: Yes, exactly. There was Richard, and there was Edmund, and there was Jeffrey, and now there's gonna be you--",
        "Josh: No no no, forget about all that. Through all of it, there was me. Pre- Richard and post-Richard. That's exactly why I can't walk away from him now. And besides, who knows what kind of loser boyfriend you're gonna have walk into your house next! I mean, come on, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Oh, that's cruel.",
        "Josh: I love him. I like being with him. We have fun together. What-- I think I know what this is about.",
        "Cassie: You do?",
        "Josh: You're worried about me because I'm crazy busy right now, dealing with the project, dealing with Reva...",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Right! That's exactly it. It's like you have two full time jobs already.",
        "Josh: Listen, listen to me. I will always have time for R.J.. I will always have time for you. Okay? Okay. Let's get you guys home.",

        "Jonathan: Pretty mad. I'm not proud of what I did.",
        "Tammy: But you did it anyway.",
        "Jonathan: I did it so we could be together, because I love--",
        "Tammy: Shh. I want you to listen to me. And really hear me this time. This is the last time you will ever shut me out, Jonathan. If we're going to be together, if we're going to make it, we have to tell each other everything. Share everything. Okay?",
