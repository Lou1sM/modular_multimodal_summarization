        "Mallet has Dinah checked out at Cedars after the car incident and tells her that he wants to find who sent the threatening notes. A beautiful woman visits and Mallet tells Dinah she is his possibly his new partner, Brooke Pearson. Dinah is obviously jealous. The car mechanic told Mallet the brakes had a slow leak and no tampering evident. Cassie fantasies about Josh rubbing her shoulders. Cassie asks Colin out on a date. Reva is shocked and afraid that Colin will tell Cassie about her cancer. Reva arranges a meeting with Jonathan and Lizzie telling them they need to tell about Jonathan being the father of the baby. Jonathan goes with Tammy to see the nursery and he cannot take his eyes from the baby items. Lizzie freaks seeing this and phones Beth for help. Lizzie, trying to scare Coop, starts to climb on the bar for a cup; Jonathan sees this and runs to \"catch\" her. Lizzie is irritated that he caught her and not Coop. Coop is frightened and tells Jonathan he was glad he was here. Jonathan tells him it was okay for Coop would have caught her if he hadn't been preoccupied (looking at Ava). Beth tells Lizzie that she will help her with the problem."

        "[I missed the first two minutes of this transcript. Sorry.]",
        "Jonathan: Didn't I already tell you I'm done dealing with your baby drama?",
        "Lizzie: Uh, yeah. You did, actually.",
        "Jonathan: Well, then what are you doing here?",
        "Lizzie: What am I doing here? You're the one who text messaged me, told me to come down here. What the hell do you want?",
        "Jonathan: No, I didn't send you a message.",
        "Lizzie: You didn't? Then who did?",
        "Reva: That would be me. Yeah, I thought maybe it was time the three of us had a little sit-down before the blessed event. Mommy, daddy, granny reva.",
        "Jonathan: Reva, you don't have to do this. We already worked it out.",
        "Reva: Really? How'd you do that, agree to continue this charade that coop is the father of the baby?",
        "Lizzie: It's for the best, reva.",
        "Reva: The \"best?\" For you two, maybe. What about everybody else? What about that baby?",
        "Jonathan: Would you stop? You already gave me the \"life is precious gift\" crap.",
        "Reva: I will not turn my back on this child. That would be like turning my back on my future, and I won't do it.",
        "Lizzie: This is none of your business.",
        "Reva: You and my son made a baby together. I'm trying to get you to understand how serious, and yes, what a precious gift that is.",
        "Lizzie: You are making it sound like I hate this kid. I don't! I already love this baby. Can you please get her out of here?",
        "Jonathan: Mom.",
        "Reva: No. Just listen to me.",
        "Lizzie: No! You listen. What kind of life is this baby going to have with jonathan? Because he doesn't want to have anything to do with it. Coop does. That's why he's going to be the daddy, not jonathan. Deal with it.",
        "Reva: So what are you going to do, lizzie, lie to coop and the baby for the rest of their lives?",
        "Lizzie: Once we get through the next few months, it'll be easy.",
        "Coop: Uh, I just... I did that.",
        "Ava: Oh. Okay.",
        "Coop: Um, so, how come you swapped your shift?",
        "Ava: Because I have a date. How about you?",
        "Coop: Lizzie's next sonogram. I thought I should probably be there. They said that we'll be able to tell whether it's a boy or a girl this time.",
        "Ava: You know what? I think that we should have just slept together. That's it. It would have been so much easier. ( Cell phone ringing )",
        "Josh: Cassie, hey, it's me. I just wanted to say thank you for this front page thing on the veterans' center. That's fantastic. And I wanted to check on rj, see how he's doing. So give me a call back when you have a chance, all right? Bye-bye.",
        "Cassie: Hey.",
        "Tammy: You're cut off.",
        "Cassie: Why?",
        "Tammy: Is there something wrong?",
        "Cassie: No, I'm fine. I... you know, I think I've been working really hard on josh's project, and the scare with rj yesterday, my brain's kind of in hyper- drive.",
        "Tammy: Oh, and you're thinking...",
        "Cassie: I'm thinking weird thoughts. I'm thinking strange thoughts, crazy things that I should not be thinking.",
        "Tammy: You have worst-case- scenario head, huh? You're imagining how bad things could have ended up with rj.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. I'm thinking I shouldn't have left him with reva after all.",
        "Tammy: Why not?",
        "Cassie: Well, she wasn't feeling well. I knew that, I think she had a hangover or something. And then, you know, she's got a full plate. She's working hard, too, helping josh with the project and... you know, they're just taking time to be together. And they deserve to enjoy their life right now. And the last thing they need is to worry about me.",
        "Dinah: Would you get off me? What is your problem?",
        "Mallet: Um, I'm trying to save your life.",
        "Dinah: From what, a door slamming across the hallway? You're my hero. What is your deal?",
        "Mallet: All right, this is my deal.",
        "Dinah: \"Payback's a bitch.\" Okay...",
        "Mallet: No, not okay. This was clipped to your dry cleaning yesterday when it was delivered. All right? Remember a couple of days ago i asked if you'd gotten a postcard in the mail, and you said you didn't? Well, you did get one. And it said, \"memorial day, how fitting\" written on it.",
        "Dinah: Are you serious?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, then there was the accident. And given the note and given the postcard, I'm not so sure that it was an accident. I got my mechanic checking out the car to make sure the brakes weren't tampered with.",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Mallet: Don't worry, okay? Nothing's going to happen to you.",
        "Dinah: Until somebody kills me.",
        "Mallet: Don't even think like that, okay? I'm going to protect you.",
        "Dinah: You know what, I am a walking bull's-eye here. And you don't so much as give me a heads-up?",
        "Mallet: I didn't want you to freak out.",
        "Dinah: Okay, excuse me, I'd rather be freaked out than dead. I would have driven a tank yesterday.",
        "Mallet: You don't need a tank. You don't need a tank, okay? Nobody's going to touch you. I'm on the case. And if some joker is out there trying to hurt you, I'll get him.",
        "Dinah: If?",
        "Mallet: Yeah. Look, I will track him down, okay? I'll find him. I'll give you my word.",
        "Dinah: Honey, there is no mystery about this. There's only one person this could be.",
        "Reva: Lizzie. Wake up! The truth will come out. And when it does, it's going to be a nightmare for everyone, including your baby.",
        "Lizzie: Well then I guess I'll just have to make sure that it doesn't come out.",
        "Reva: You're a fool, jonathan. You're a fool to think that you'll be able to live with this, or to pretend that that child means nothing to you.",
        "Jonathan: How do you know?",
        "Reva: Because no parent can. It will start gnawing at you. And it'll never stop.",
        "Lizzie: Okay! You've made your case, you've gone on record. But now you have to swear that you are not going to tell anyone else. Promise us.",
        "Tammy: Wow, hi.",
        "Reva: Hi.",
        "Tammy: Having a party?",
        "Jonathan: Hey.",
        "Tammy: Hey.",
        "Jonathan: I thought you had to run some errands.",
        "Tammy: I did. I'm done. And look who I found.",
        "Cassie: Hey, what'S... what's going on?",
        "Jonathan: Are we okay?",
        "Reva: This has to be your decision.",
        "Tammy: Decision about what?",
        "Jonathan: Oh, reva's just doing the mom thing. She's worrying about where we're going to live. I told her not to sweat it.",
        "Tammy: And you're here because?",
        "Lizzie: Because I was looking for you.",
        "Tammy: Well, you must have read my mind, because there's something I want to talk to you about, actually.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, great.",
        "Tammy: Well, let's do it at company, over a snack. The three of us.",
        "Lizzie: I'M... you know, I'm actually... I'm not that hungry.",
        "Tammy: Well come on, we've got to make sure your little guy is getting enough french fries. Come on.",
        "Lizzie: Okay.",
        "Mallet: So,lan michael threatened you? Let me get th... alan michael threatened you? When did this happen?",
        "Dinah: Honey, the other day.",
        "Mallet: Oh, jeez, thanks for telling me.",
        "Dinah: Well, now you know how it feels. Look, I am not so convinced that he's not behind this whole thing, or is behind this whole thing. I don't know. I mean, despite my dazzling personality, I think a lot of people hate me and it could have been any one of them. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Mallet: Oh good, it's the mechanic. Hold on. Hey man, it's A.C. What's up? Okay. Really. Really? Are you positive? Okay. No, thanks, man. Thanks. Wow, okay. So your brake lines were not sabotaged. There was just a slow leak in the line.",
        "Dinah: Well, that's good. Better than someone making them fail.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, but still, i think you should stop pissing off so many people.",
        "Dinah: Honey, look. I'll tell you what, what do you want me to do? You want me to stop living?",
        "Mallet: No, I want you to maybe, first of all, stop going to spaulding and associating with anybody by that name.",
        "Dinah: Well, I can't do that. That's not really an option, okay? Look, I want you to relax. I'm not stupid. I'm a smart girl. Okay? And I'm not going to go into my shell and hide. I mean, I have a job to do.",
        "Mallet: I know. I'm just telling you, though, just please stay away from spaulding. Let's just start there, okay?",
        "Dinah: Honey, look. Let me tell you something, i just can't not go to work. And I don't want you to worry. But, you know, I'm okay. There are people at work that are okay with me. I just... ms. Marler has everything under control, all right?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, fine.",
        "Dinah: All right. Enjoy. See you later.",
        "Mallet: See you.",
        "Brooke: I'm looking for A.C. Mallet? And there he is.",
        "Mallet: Oh, hey. How are you? Uh... uh, wow. Here you are.",
        "Dinah: Who's here?",
        "Mallet: Uh... dinah, this is... uh, brooke pierson.",
        "Brooke: I'm mallet's new partner.",
        "Cassie: You think I'm mad at you, don't you?",
        "Reva: No, that really isn'T...",
        "Cassie: You blame yourself. Come on, you blame yourself for rj running off. And you think that I point the finger at you, too, but I don'T. I know you did everything you could.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well...",
        "Cassie: You got that doctor what's-his-name to help.",
        "Reva: I'd still be mad if i were you.",
        "Cassie: Well, I'm not. I know it's not your fault. I had a long talk with rj last night, and he admitted he knew it was wrong to run off like that. I don't know, I think temptation just got the better of him.",
        "Reva: Well, still, I'm glad you're not mad at me. I've been a little preoccupied lately.",
        "Cassie: Well, with good reason. Reva, I... I am so on your side. This is a whole new beginning for you and josh, you know? It's the start of years and years of happiness.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, that's what I want. I really, really want that. I want to live, and I want to enjoy life because, believe it or not, you can take it for granted so easily, you know? What we have, the time that we have, the people we love, family.",
        "Josh: There they are, the two sisters sitting together. Which is kind of a surprise, because I was just thinking to myself which one of you two has been tougher to track down?",
        "Coop: ( Clears throat )",
        "Ava: Yeah, I just didn't say that.",
        "Coop: What, about wishing we had slept together?",
        "Ava: I just... I didn't mean anything by it, I'm sorry. It just kind of came out, and...",
        "Coop: Hey, that's fine. It just sounded like something a guy might say, that's all.",
        "Ava: Uh, and why would a guy say that?",
        "Coop: Well, uh, because, you know... there's a lot of tension that can build up in guys, um, from, you know, thinking about it, waiting for it, wondering what it would be like.",
        "Ava: Mm.",
        "Coop: ( Laughs )",
        "Ava: Yeah, I... and?",
        "Coop: And... and, you know, sometimes that tension can just sort of go away after you... you know. I mean, finally when you...",
        "Ava: What... how?",
        "Coop: ...Do have it. Sex, I mean.",
        "Ava: Oh, oh. Okay. Very interesting theory, don't you think?",
        "Coop: ( Laughs ) yeah.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, no, you don'T.",
        "Tammy: Uh-oh. Better go referee.",
        "Lizzie: Coop! I have to show you something.",
        "Coop: Oh, uh...",
        "Lizzie: Feel this. It kicked.",
        "Coop: Are you kidding? Already?",
        "Ava: Going to the kitchen.",
        "Coop: Ava, right...",
        "Lizzie: Look, look there, there.",
        "Coop: What? What's there. Did I miss it?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, you missed it. I can't believe it.",
        "Tammy: Hey coop.",
        "Coop: Yes?",
        "Tammy: Can I go up to the nursery? I want to show it to jonathan.",
        "Coop: Um, sure. I'll take you up there.",
        "Jonathan: No, that's fine. You guys can go up. I'm going to stay down here.",
        "Tammy: Don't be such a guy. It's a sweet room.",
        "Lizzie: But it's small. You know, for so many people.",
        "Tammy: Well, we can squeeze. Come on. Oh, I love it in here. It's so cute. Well, don't be shy. The stuffed animals won't bite ya. I mean, can't you imagine that little baby just chilling out in here? Rob bogue, \"inside the light.\" I think mallet's best quality is he'll always try to do the right thing. His worst quality probably would be he's very hard on himself. Working with gina has really been fantastic since I've been here. Just watching her taking this quantum leap as an actress. She's just, like, blossoming right in front of my eyes, and it's really exciting to watch. See mallet, wednesday, june",
        "Dinah: My, my, my, I didn't realize you got a new partner.",
        "Mallet: Well, it hasn't been confirmed yet. Uh, gee, brooke, I... I... uh... I didn't know you were stopping by.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, sorry just to drop in on you like this, but chief cooper suggested I swing by.",
        "Dinah: And here you are!",
        "Brooke: I'm glad we can finally have some time together.",
        "Mallet: Brooke-- I mean, detective pierson--just transferred in from chicago, and we... well, we kind of met in passing at the station.",
        "Dinah: And you're mallet's new partner?",
        "Brooke: I hope so, given his record. It would be an honor and a privilege to work with you, A.C.",
        "Mallet: Oh, you can call me mallet. Everybody does. It's cool.",
        "Dinah: They call me dinah, his girlfriend.",
        "Mallet: This is my girlfriend.",
        "Dinah: Hi. We live together. Apologize for the mess.",
        "Mallet: ( Laughs )",
        "Brooke: You're a lucky woman.",
        "Dinah: (Laughs) so far!",
        "Mallet: Anyway, we were just... we were on our way, right? We were running... we were getting ready to run out.",
        "Dinah: Actually, I have all day. I have all day. I have plenty of time. More time here means less time there, and the safer things will be.",
        "Mallet: Right. Well, ladies, I hate to be rude, but I got a case I got to be cracking on, and... brooke, thanks. Thanks for stopping by. It's good to see you again, and you know what? Let's stay in touch. Yeah?",
        "Brooke: Yeah, I can't wait.",
        "Mallet: Okay.",
        "Brooke: Nice meeting you, dinah.",
        "Dinah: Nice to meet you too, blair... brooke. Take care.",
        "Mallet: ( Laughs )",
        "Dinah: And what case do you have to focus on?",
        "Mallet: Yours!",
        "Dinah: Mm-hmm.",
        "Mallet: Oh, and you know what? I'm kind of glad that you decided to bag work so we can get to the bottom of who's sending those nasty letters.",
        "Dinah: Honey?",
        "Mallet: Hmm?",
        "Dinah: You're a damn fool if you think that's why I stuck around.",
        "Mallet: ( Sighs ) I was afraid you were going to say that.",
        "Coop: It's still amazing to think about, that in a few months, the baby's going to be spending time here. And at your family's house, too.",
        "Tammy: Ava did a beautiful job with the room. Didn't she? Jonathan?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Yes.",
        "Lizzie: I'm getting hungry. We should go.",
        "Coop: Fine.",
        "Jonathan: So ava put this room together for you and all by herself?",
        "Coop: Yes. What about it?",
        "Jonathan: Nothing.",
        "Tammy: Did you come up with any names yet?",
        "Coop: Um, lizzie did. She seems to think that it's going to be a girl. So she wanted to name it jenna after my mom.",
        "Tammy: Oh, that's sweet.",
        "Coop: We really haven't even thought of any boys' names yet, although I spent an hour the other day looking through the book, through the a's, and i came up with arthur, adam, ambrose.",
        "Tammy: Ambrose.",
        "Coop: Ambrose.",
        "Tammy: ( Laughs )",
        "Lizzie: Jonathan knows about the baby. Well, yes, of course I am sure. This is turning into a nightmare. Yeah, okay, guess where he is right now? He's at the nursery at company. No, I'm not kidding! It's coop, tammy, jonathan, and me. We're together, we're down here, and I am losing my mind. Help!",
        "Beth: Lizzie? Hello?",
        "Tammy: So jenna if it's a girl. Jenna what?",
        "Coop: Jenna elizabeth?",
        "Tammy: Oh, that's a good family name.",
        "Coop: Yeah, well, we're not even sure we want to... we like that-- I mean if it's a boy, it'll... maybe phillip frank maybe.",
        "Tammy: Were you named after somebody?",
        "Coop: Actually, yeah. My mom's old-time friend. I kind of like that, though, keeping it in the family.",
        "Tammy: Yeah.",
        "Coop: So it's really nice.",
        "Tammy: It's sweet.",
        "Reva: You know, you have perfect timing because cassie was just getting ready to launch into another dissertation on how she needs to back out of our lives and not burden us with hers.",
        "Cassie: I was not.",
        "Reva: You have this crazy idea that you're imposing on us and holding us back.",
        "Josh: Which is absolutely not true. In fact, it's quite the opposite. You make things better. It's one of the things I love about you.",
        "Cassie: Well, you know, you guys have each other to love, and... and you need time to... just to enjoy that.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs )",
        "Josh: Mmm, yeah.",
        "Josh: Hey, dr. Mccabe. How you doing?",
        "Colin: Good.",
        "Josh: On your way to the hospital or something?",
        "Colin: Yeah, I am actually, and I'm late, so excuse me.",
        "Josh: Hey, have you had a chance to meet my sister-in-law? This is cassie winslow. Dr. Mccabe. It'S... uh, colin, right?",
        "Colin: Yeah, uh.. actually, hello again, cassie.",
        "Cassie: Hi. Yeah, we actually already met at the hospital.",
        "Reva: Small world.",
        "Cassie: Oh, reva told me that you helped look for my son, rj.",
        "Colin: Oh. Well, I... no, I didn't do very much. I barely know the town myself yet.",
        "Cassie: Well, still, i appreciate you making the effort.",
        "Colin: Well, I understand the boy was found safe and sound. That's all that matters.",
        "Josh: He was actually asleep in my car.",
        "Colin: Oh, well, at least he didn't go very far.",
        "Josh: Yeah. Rj and I have been bonding a little bit lately, don't you think? I mean, a couple of weeks ago in the farmhouse, remember, he and I were, like hanging out, and...",

        "Cassie: Don't worry, I'm not crazy.",
        "Colin: ( Laughs )",
        "Josh: Actually, she is crazy.",
        "Cassie: Hey, help me out here. I was just thinking, you said you don't know springfield very well, and that... you know, maybe I could show you the sights as a thank you for helping to look for rj.",
        "Colin: Well...",
        "Cassie: It wouldn't be a grand tour or anything, just, you know, a few sights. I could... I could take you to my favorite bar. We could have a drink, or dinner...",
        "Reva: I'm sure that dr. Mccabe is too busy to...",
        "Colin: I'd like that. I'd like that.",
        "Reva: Well, I know what I'd like, a cup of coffee. Anybody else? You want to warm that up?",
        "Colin: Uh... yes, right.",
        "Josh: Hey, did you see the newspaper cover on the...?",
        "Colin: Why did you do that?!",
        "Reva: Why did you do that?!",
        "Colin: You're the one who's always telling me I need to get a life. Maybe I'm trying to.",
        "Reva: Yes, that's fine, but not with her!",
        "Colin: A beautiful woman asks me out for a drink, maybe dinner and I say yes. What's the big deal? That's all.",
        "Reva: The big deal? The big deal is that you're going to sit there over a drink or over dinner, and you're going to talk.",
        "Colin: What are you afraid of, reva, that I'm going to talk to her about your cancer treatment?",
        "Reva: Maybe.",
        "Colin: Reva, relax. I'm not that unprofessional, or easy.",
        "Josh: Um...",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Josh: I was just thinking that it's very unlike you to, um...",
        "Cassie: Ask a guy out on a date who I'd only met once before?",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, well, I guess you could say I had an impulse, and I went with it, took a shot.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Cassie: It's because of you. I mean, because of you and reva, because you two inspire me.",
        "Dinah: You're still not partnering up with detective babbling brooke.",
        "Mallet: Oh, good lord.",
        "Dinah: Look, I'm trying to help you out.",
        "Mallet: Right, right.",
        "Dinah: Look. There is no way a beautiful, tall, gorgeous woman is willing to mess her little mane to take a bullet. You need a bullet-taker.",
        "Mallet: It's hard to get people to apply for that job, okay? She's a good detective. I checked her out.",
        "Dinah: I bet you did.",
        "Mallet: Brooke is not even my type. You're my type.",
        "Dinah: You want a cracker with that cheese?",
        "Mallet: ( Laughs ) come here. Come here. Excuse me, but who was it before who was trying to hook me up with a new partner? Let me think about that. Hmm... oh, that's right. That was you.",
        "Dinah: Not the point.",
        "Mallet: Let's forget about the pd for a second, okay? You're my full-time job. And I want to be good at it. Am I good at it?",
        "Dinah: Yes, you're good. But you're still not teaming up with her.",
        "Mallet: ( Groans ) and you say I can't keep you from going to work just because of someone who might be there?",
        "Dinah: Two completely different scenarios, my friend. When I'm at work, the only thing I have to worry about is a parking space and avoiding the occasional paper cut. You, on the other hand, you are living on the streets.",
        "Mallet: So?",
        "Dinah: So? Alan michael, he may be my partner, but I am not dependent on him. I am not dependent on him, and i don't have to lean on him. You, on the other hand, have to put your life in this woman's hands. You're going to get in high emotional situations, you're going to start bonding. And once you start bonding, then...",
        "Mallet: What, then I'm going to cheat again?",
        "Dinah: Things happen.",
        "Mallet: You still don't trust me.",
        "Coop: I need to go back downstairs and get back to work, so, uh...",
        "Tammy: Oh lizzie, wait. Hey, um... what I wanted to talk to you about was your baby shower. You know, I figured your mom might not feel up to planning it since what happened with her baby, so... if that's the case, I'd be willing to help, make some calls, and... when are you due again?",
        "Lizzie: I, um... uh... can we talk about this later? I'm starving, and jonathan's all babied out. Look at him. We should go.",
        "Coop: Frank, look, I am so sorry. I didn't mean for you to get pressed into service here. I took too long. It's my fault. I'm sorry.",
        "Frank: That's okay. That's what brothers are for, okay? Don't worry about it. It's all good, man. It's all good.",
        "Coop: Thanks. Yeah, right. Ava, hey, look... look, I just wanted to apologize. I didn't mean to take so long up there and get hung up and leave you...",
        "Ava: Don'T... it's fine. Frank helped me out. It's no big deal. How did the tour of the nursery go?",
        "Coop: Um, well... fine.",
        "Ava: Listen, what I said to you earlier about you and me and sex...",
        "Coop: Yeah, ava, please, if we could just not talk about those three words together, that would really help actually.",
        "Ava: Right.",
        "Coop: Right. ( Clears throat )",
        "Tammy: So could I, like, get something to eat?",
        "Coop: Uh, sure. What can I get you all?",
        "Tammy: Jonathan, what do you feel...?",
        "Tammy: Jonathan?!",
        "Lizzie: He's still up there? Oh, god, I hate this day!",
        "Tammy: Oh, lizzie, hey. Chill. Coop is a totally stand-up guy. If he says he's committed to you and the baby, you can count on that. I mean, he's willing to move in with you and your family. Doesn't that prove to you where his heart is?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. Yes, you're right. I have nothing to worry about. It's just... it's these hormones just keep kicking in. Ava, could I get a cup of decaf coffee? Ooh, from a fresh pot please.",
        "Ava: Of course. ( Cell phone rings ) hello? Officer morris. Ooh, that's very sophisticated. ( Laughs ) okay, only when you're wearing your uniform. I'll remember that. So are we still on for tonight?",
        "Lizzie: Forget the coffee. I'll get it myself.",
        "Ava: 8:00 is perfect actually. That sounds wonderful. It is so beautiful by the lake.",
        "Jonathan: Hey!",
        "Mallet: You know, what happened before is not going to happen again. Do you know why? Because I'm not going to let it. Because last time I lost my marriage, but I'm not going to lose you.",
        "Dinah: I thought we were pretty good partners.",
        "Mallet: We're great partners. And I think we should stay together. I think we should stay together no matter what. All right? Especially with these notes, these stupid threatening notes. Who's behind these notes? Hmm?",
        "Dinah: I don't know. Maybe they're just a prank.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, possible, but... we have to make sure, and until we can make sure, we can't afford to let our guard down, okay? And come on, we can't afford to keep doubting each other. All right? Do you understand me?",
        "Dinah: Yeah.",
        "Mallet: Okay, good. Look, I'm going to go into work tomorrow. Brooke may be my partner, or frank may hook me up with somebody else. But, you know, I don't care. I don't care. Who cares? Because either way no one's going to come between us. You got that?",
        "Dinah: All right, well, I'm going to still hold out for your partner to be a big, hairy, sweaty, ugly dude.",
        "Mallet: ( Laughs ) I'll pass along your request.",
        "Dinah: All right.",
        "Mallet: So uh, I'm going to take a shower. Do you want to take a shower?",
        "Dinah: Yeah.",
        "Mallet: Yeah?",
        "Dinah: In a second.",
        "Mallet: Okay, partner. Maybe, uh, half a second?",
        "Dinah: Hi, it's me. Um, I want to let you know that I'm not coming in tomorrow. I have some important business to do outside the office. Okay. All right. Bye-bye.",
        "Colin: Here you go.",
        "Cassie: Oh, thanks.",
        "Colin: Oh, I didn't even ask if you wanted coffee. Did you...?",
        "Cassie: I did, I do. Thank you.",
        "Josh: So, okay. I'm just going to leave you two kids alone. Excuse me.",
        "Cassie: Funny guy, huh?",
        "Colin: Yeah. Well, uh, so how do you want to do this? Should I give you a call later?",
        "Cassie: Please. Yeah. We'll do something fun.",
        "Colin: Fun. Maybe we could get some pointers from those two.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, we should all be so lucky to have what they have. They are the most amazing couple I know. There's really nothing that those two can't overcome.",
        "Josh: You feeling okay?",
        "Reva: Mostly.",
        "Josh: You said you had some errands to run today, right?",
        "Reva: Yes, and I got them all done but one. I have one left, and I'm going to do it, I guarantee you of that, even if it takes drastic measures.",
        "Josh: Okay, reva, I don't think going to the market really requires a blood oath, but i appreciate it.",
        "Reva: Oh, you, you. You know how I am when I set my mind to something. I don't give up.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, what was that?",
        "Lizzie: I just... I just sort of lost my balance. Thanks.",
        "Coop: Uh... are you okay?",
        "Tammy: She should get some water.",
        "Lizzie: I'm fine.",
        "Coop: Look, um... and the baby?",
        "Lizzie: The baby is fine. See?",
        "Coop: Man, if, uh... if you weren't here...",
        "Jonathan: No, no. You would have caught her... if you weren't so, um... distracted.",
        "Lizzie: Mom!",
        "Beth: Sweetie. What just happened?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, I just had the most unbelievable scare.",
        "Beth: Yeah. You and me both. But you're safe now. Everything's fine.",
        "Lizzie: No, everything is falling apart. Jonathan knows, reva knows.",
        "Beth: Shh! Keep your voice down.",
        "Lizzie: Did you see the way he was looking at me when he was holding me?",
        "Beth: Well, the truth is, he probably did just save you and your baby.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, his! His baby!",
        "Beth: You have to be more careful. You're pregnant, what are you doing being so reckless?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, god, what difference does it make? My life is going to hell.",
        "Beth: Don't say that.",
        "Lizzie: It is. Jonathan is going to blow this. He is going to blow it for me and coop and the baby. I know that he is, I can feel. Mom, you've got to help me.",
        "Beth: Hey, hey. Who's to say that I already haven't, hmm?",
        "Tammy: That baby owes you a lot.",
        "Jonathan: No.",
        "Tammy: What's wrong?",
        "Jonathan: Nothing. Let'S... let's get out of here. I've had enough baby drama crap for one day.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Dinah: Well, we have an episode of \"the law\" here. They're following mallet on one of his stakeouts.",
        "Mallet: Hi.",
        "Dinah: Baby, bubble bath's getting... oh, my gosh, what are you all doing? What the hell's going on?",
        "Brooke: You're a hero! He's a hero. He's a hero, and springfield is lucky to have him.",
        "Dinah: What do you think, babe? Think you're going to have to shoot somebody tonight? Oh, honey, I got stories for you. They will eat it up."
