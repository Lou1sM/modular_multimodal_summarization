        "Mallet, clad only in a towel, is met at his door by a woman who is assigned to follow him around tonight with a camera crew filming for the TV show, \"The Law\". The TV show stars Gus, Marina, Frank, and Mallet. Dinah, clad in a towel, too, is all excited and asks to go along. She ends up asking Mallet to let her go patrol and the camera people tell Mallet they want to see him in action on the streets and in his personal life, too.",
        "Dinah gets bored, makes a nuisance of herself and drives Mallet crazy. He collars a perp on the streets and by mistake, the guy is only buying groceries and not drugs. The camera people see Gus in an alley and Mallet makes them stop filming, but they don't and instead film a drunken-looking Gus. Mallet goes to a church after hearing about a hostage situation and Dinah ends up talking a woman out of killing her ex-fiance. Mallet is impressed, the two stay to see a bride and groom marry and Mallet ends up asking Dinah to marry him. She says yes. The camera crew continues to film all of this without Mallet and Dinah knowing. Later, Mallet and Dinah nervously ask the other if they still want to get married and they both say yes, but are not convinced themselves. The camera crew continue to film everything..."

        "Mallet: Yeah! Coming! Just put that cold beer right over here in the... whoa, hey. Oh. Oh, no. Oh, no. You're kidding me. We're not doing this tonight, are we? I mean, you're not... we're not taping tonight?",
        "Mia: But Chief Cooper sent me over to get you miked up and get you ready. Come on in, boys. You are ready for this, aren't you?",
        "Mallet: Well, yeah, I just... I agreed to let a camera crew follow me around, but I... I got a lot... I got a lot going on right now. I don't know... if this is a good idea. Hi.",
        "Dinah: Baby! Bubble bath's getting... oh, my gosh! What are you all doing? What the hell's going on? I'm not even dressed! What is this?",
        "Mallet: Well, this is... this is... I agreed a couple of weeks ago with Frank that I'd let them do that show, you know, where they follow cops around and watch them bust people.",
        "Dinah: \"The Law\"?",
        "Mallet: Yeah.",
        "Dinah: They're going to put you on TV?",
        "Mallet: Yeah. ( Laughs )",
        "Dinah: Honey, you're not much of a show-biz type. Are you sure?",
        "Mallet: I'll have you know I won my eighth grade lip-synching contest. I was a killer Diana Ross.",
        "Dinah: Okay, shh... don't admit that!",
        "Mallet: Oh yeah, you guys weren't taping that, were you?",
        "Mia: Don't worry, we air after 10.",
        "Mallet: Oh, okay. So I guess we're doing this, right? I have to go to work now, so I guess I'll get dressed.",
        "Dinah: Okay, wait, can I go with you? Let me go with you. Let me just see what you do and who you do it with.",
        "Mallet: No, I think another day. I don't... another day.",
        "Dinah: No. Come on, listen, I won't make a peep. I'll be real quiet. Unless you want that little sexy partner that you got, your new partner, the sexy one, and who knows what she's going to do? She going to grab at your service revolver?",
        "Mallet: Whoa, honey! She's not my partner yet, and she's not that hot. I mean, she's not... she's... she's a... she's a little hot.",
        "Dinah: He didn't mean that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: This is our... base of operations. This is what we call the hub, mission control, HQ. This is where it all happens, this is... this is where it all goes down. We believe in teamwork here, and.... well, speaking of which, the Chief of Police. It all starts at the top. There he is now. Hey, Frank. Reporting for duty, sir. Yeah, he's... he's a heck of a guy. I mean, all the glory always goes to his men. Dust bunny, upper right corner there, Frank. He's always cleaning up after us. And someone has to, because we have a very large caseload.",
        "Mia: How do you decide which cases get top priority?",
        "Mallet: That's a good question. That's a very good question. And, as you can see... we have as many unsolved cases as we do actual officers. We have a little bit of everything, of course-- homicides, robberies, even some missing pets. I think the thing that we always try to remember around here is that every single one of these cases is important to someone. An old lady is just as concerned about her lost cat as, let's say, maybe a robbery victim about his wallet. The thing I try to remember every night before I go to bed is, where can I do the most good? Is it this case or that case? Which one poses a greater risk to the general public? And I guess, you know, after so many years, it becomes instinctual. It's like, I don't know, second nature. It's kind of like eating or drinking, or...",
        "Dinah: Sex. Just to remind him, folks.",
        "Olivia: And who can blame her? I mean, really. I mean, as significant others of police officers, we have to remind them who they're coming home to, you know? Why it's important to be careful. Because police officers are injured every day. Frank! Psst, come here.",
        "Frank: Excuse me.",
        "Olivia: Frank? Frank, Frank, Frank. Chief Cooper, he took a bullet just a few weeks ago.",
        "Frank: Look, it wasn't really that big of a deal...",
        "Olivia: How could be a bigger deal? He saved a little girl's life. And when I think about how... how much I care about him, how much I almost lost him, how brave he was...",
        "Frank: Olivia, that's... that's...",
        "Olivia: You're a hero! He's a hero. He's a hero, and Springfield is lucky to have him.",
        "Frank: I'm going to check the timesheets, so excuse me.",
        "Olivia: Hey, Frank... bye.",
        "Frank: Yep.",
        "Olivia: He's humble. He's so humble.",
        "Marina: We've got a hot one! Oh, Mallet, wait until you get a look at... hi!",
        "Mallet: This is Chief Cooper's daughter, Marina Cooper, one of our finest, youngest officers. ( Quietly ) They're shooting an episode of \"The Law.\" So, what kind of tip do you have there, Marina? What kind of... what kind of hot tip do you have? Marina? ( Chuckles ) Marina, what kind of tip do you have there?",
        "Marina: Marina? Oh, tip, yeah.",
        "Mallet: Let's see what this hot tip is. Drug supplier's scheduled drop- off: Corner of 4th street and Main. Okay. We got to move on this one. We're going on a stakeout.",
        "Dinah: Oh, honey. Honey, can I come along? Let me come along. I'll fill in as your partner.",
        "Mallet: ( Softly ) You know, that's not a good idea.",
        "Mia: I love it.",
        "Dinah: Yeah... yeah. Listen, I'll be quiet as a mouse, they won't even know I'm there. You guys have to hook me up with a mike pack, right?",
        "Mallet: No, listen, honey, that's not a good idea. It could get really messy tonight. You just need to stay here, stay...",
        "Dinah: No! Honey, please, come on!",
        "Mallet: No, that's final! Okay, let's move. That's what I love about this job is that no two days are ever the same. You know, it's always the... always the thrill of the unexpected.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Eww, there's chewing gum stuck back here!",
        "Mallet: ( Sighs ) I mean, one day, you got a domestic violence case; the next, pack of teens with a glue problem.",
        "Dinah: Honey, how long does this take, usually? I mean, do we just, like, swoop right in, or... hot damn, that guy just ran a red light! Baby, come on, move it!",
        "Mallet: Honey, calm down, all right? I'm on patrol.",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs )",
        "Mallet: She's a little nervous.",
        "Dinah: I'm not nervous, I love these things. I love patrolling, I love the lights, I love the sound of the sirens. Gets my mojo going. What do you think, babe? Think you're going to have to shoot somebody tonight?",
        "Mallet: Oh, I just might. Policeman, policeman we're makin' it safe for you Policeman, policeman we're puttin' 'way bad guys Policeman, policeman we're makin' it safe for you Policeman, policeman we're puttin' 'way bad guys Protecting the people in town You break the law we gonna bring you down We're working night and day to keep you safe in every way Policeman, policeman we're makin' it safe for you Policeman, policeman we're puttin' 'way bad guys Policeman, policeman we're makin' it safe for you Policeman, policeman we're puttin' 'way bad guys Policeman, policeman we're puttin' 'way bad guys. Policeman, policeman we're makin' it safe for you Policeman, policeman we're puttin' 'way bad guys Policeman, policeman we're puttin' 'way bad guys.",
        "Mallet: Well, that's the thing about surveillance is you can never totally relax... because you never know when all hell's going to break loose, especially when it comes down to a drug deal.",
        "Mia: Which way should we be looking?",
        "Dinah: I don't see anything. Seriously, I don't see anything. When are we going to see something?",
        "Mallet: I don't know.",
        "Dinah: Do we have snacks?",
        "Mallet: ( Sighs )",
        "Dinah: You guys have got to buy some snacks. These guys put their life on the lines...",
        "Mallet: We have donuts. We have donuts, back at the station.",
        "Dinah: Oh, lot of good that's going to do me now. My blood sugar's plummeting. Okay, let's turn on the radio.",
        "Mallet: We can't use the radio, okay? We're trying to be incognito.",
        "Dinah: Babe? We've got a camera crew in the car. I don't think we're pulling off incognito very well. All right, let's just play some word games. ( Clapping ) Apple!",
        "Mallet: No word games. I need to be alert here. Thank you.",
        "Dinah: Babe, I got a better idea for the segment. You know what we do? I play the sexy new partner, we talk about sports, weather... and then, we talk about sex.",
        "Mallet: I... ( laughs ) I'm sorry, guys, I don't...I don't think you should be shooting this, because it's... this isn't really police business.",
        "Mia: Our viewers like to see all aspects of your day, including the personal stuff.",
        "Dinah: Oh, honey, I got stories for you. They will eat it up...",
        "Mallet: All right, you know what? I think I actually have some snacks. I think I've got some Pringles in here somewhere.",
        "Dinah: ( Gasps ) What flavor?",
        "Mallet: Sour cream and... and onion. You know what, honey? Company is right down the street. Why don't you go get all of us some coffee...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Hi, okay, you're following me, aren't you? Um, you don't need to. I'm not a cop. I'm the antithesis of a cop. I spent some time in jail, and at one point, a Turkish prison, but I mean, that's not... don't use that! Don't use that. That's not good. Nope. I'm going to check on that, make sure you don't air it. Buzz, hi!",
        "Buzz: Hi.",
        "Dinah: Can I get a dozen donuts and some coffee?",
        "Buzz: What, are you doing a reality show of your own?",
        "Dinah: Well, we have an episode of \"The Law\" here. They're following Mallet on one of his stakeouts. And unfortunately, nothing, and I mean nothing, was happening. They'd probably have more action seeing you cook up some toast.",
        "Buzz: ( Laughs )",
        "Dinah: Guys, this is Buzz Cooper.",
        "Buzz: Hey.",
        "Dinah: This is Chief Cooper's father. It's the coolest place in town, the best restaurant in Springfield. Isn't it strange watching people tape you all the time? I feel very self-conscious... I don't know about you.",
        "Buzz: Well, you know, I've actually had some on-camera experience and people saw... I was on a game show, and they thought I looked so natural, maybe I should pursue a career in acting. But it probably wouldn't have panned out anyway...",
        "Dinah: We're going to go back to the stakeout. Buzz, you take care. Come on, guys, let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mia: Considering all the hours you put in, the danger... is it hard to maintain a relationship?",
        "Mallet: ( Laughs ) Yeah, it's not easy. But I don't think the job has anything to do with it, really.",
        "Mia: Well, what do you mean?",
        "Mallet: Well, I mean... things with Dinah are great. It's just... but...",
        "Mia: But what?",
        "Mallet: Nothing, I really don't want to get into it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: You know, I have to make a bit of a confession, I don't open up very easily. I'm like a clam, you know? But I tell you, I've been trying to get over my past. I've been trying to let it go, and... it's a hard thing. I've been hurt, I've been hurt more than once. I've been hurt a lot, actually. But I got a guy in my life like Mallet. You know, he just is a gem. He makes me... just makes me feel amazing. He just... he says the right things, he does the right things, but I tell you what, he's... he's not always had it so easy. He's had his problems, too, you know. I mean, he had a problem with his past wife. He cheated on her during stakeouts.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: You know, there's one thing I've learned on this job. You see the same people making the same mistakes over and over again. And they always say the same thing-- \"Oh, I'm never going to do that again,\" and \"I'm never going to go back to jail.\" Blah, blah, blah. But... a week after their release? Boom, same crime.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: You know? I mean, I don't know if they were always in the car or where they were, you know. I don't even want to think about it, it swirls in my head like a... I don't know, like a boat without a rudder. I don't know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: I think older can mean wiser. I think if you learn from what you did, you learn from the past, you protect what you have.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Okay, guys, come on. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: I think that's the guy. That's him, right there. Policeman, policeman...",
        "Mallet: That's the guy.",
        "Dinah: Hi, they only had cappuccino...",
        "Mallet: Come here, quick. Okay, thanks, get in the car.",
        "Dinah: ( Gasps )",
        "Mallet: Quick, get in the car, get in the car. Come on, we got to go.",
        "Dinah: Oh... ow!",
        "Mallet: Oh, man. Uh, here. Hang on. Put your seatbelt on, sweetie, and stay quiet. We're puttin' 'way bad guys...",
        "Mallet: All right, we just wait for the exchange.",
        "Mia: Big bag.",
        "Mallet: Big bag means big crime. 10 to 20 at least, poor sucker. All right, time to clean up the streets. Policeman...",
        "Mallet: Freeze, police! Hand in the air, scumbag! On your stomach! On your stomach, hands behind your back! You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you...",
        "Man: No, hold on, man! I'm clean! Clean!",
        "Mallet: Oh, is that right, tough guy? Let me take a little look here, huh? What do you think there, champ? What do we got here, huh? Bread... apple... salami... we got eggs... what else we got in here, man? Aha! A toothbrush?",
        "Man: Look, man, I pay somebody to do my shopping, okay? Big freaking crime.",
        "Dinah: All right, okay. Honey, you broke some eggs, he's going to get over it.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, it's... well, sometimes you miss. All right, man, clean it up. Get this out of here, let's go. Move along, people, nothing to see. I don't want to citation you for littering. Let's go.",
        "Mia: Detective Mallet?",
        "Mallet: Yeah?",
        "Mia: Uh... that guy doesn't look so good.",
        "Mallet: Bread's fine.",
        "Mia: No, that guy over there. Policeman, policeman...",
        "Mallet: Turn off that camera, man. Turn it off! Policeman, policeman, we're puttin' away bad guys Policeman, policeman, we're puttin' away bad guys...",
        "Dinah: Hey. You know what? He asked you to turn the camera off. You leave, right now.",
        "Mia: Why? What's going on? Who is that over there?",
        "Dinah: That was his friend and his partner, and they've had personal problems, so... you know what, this is not for public consumption, so I ask you guys to leave right now, all right?",
        "Mia: Sure. We understand. ( Whispers ): Circle around. Don't let them see you.",
        "Mallet: Gus, what's up man? What are you doing here? Hey, man, you getting clean?",
        "Gus: Hmm?",
        "Mallet: What are you doing?! What are you... did you talk to Harley? Gus, did you call Harley? Listen. Just call her, okay?",
        "Gus: Leave me alone.",
        "Mallet: Just call her, okay? She just wants to come home, that's all she wants.",
        "Gus: It's none of your business.",
        "Mallet: Listen, what's the... why don't I take you home, all right? Clean you up, we'll do some talking, all right?",
        "Dispatcher: Code three. 923 Burnett Avenue. Please respond. Code three.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, this is Blue Dog One, go ahead. I'm a few miles from there. What do we got?",
        "Dispatcher: Possible hostage situation.",
        "Mallet: Roger. I'm all over it. Hang on, everybody. It's time to go to work.",
        "Dinah: Yee-ha! Going to see some action, honey! ( Sirens blaring )",
        "Dinah: I love listening to the sirens and watching all the lights... I love seeing people just move out of the way.",
        "Mallet: That's kind of the idea, honey.",
        "Dinah: Mm-hmm. Why didn't you do this last week when I was late for my meeting?",
        "Mallet: Because it's a little bit illegal?",
        "Dinah: Oh, come on, no one would know.",
        "Mallet: I would know!",
        "Dinah: Mallet plays everything by the book. He's a good guy. Except when we get home in private, he gets a little naughty. ( Laughs ) Honey, what do we got going on for tonight? What kind of situation will we be getting into?",
        "Mallet: It's, uh... ten... it's a ten... it's a hostage crisis situation.",
        "Dinah: What kind?",
        "Mallet: It's... one involving a hostage?",
        "Dinah: Oh. Wait a minute, wait a minute, you haven't asked any questions? What if we need back-up?",
        "Mallet: We won't need back- up, because you're staying in the car because it might be dangerous.",
        "Dinah: Honey, if you're not afraid, I'm not afraid.",
        "Mallet: Dinah! I don't know what we're walking into, okay? But I have no intention of going home alone tonight to an empty room, okay? So just... do you understand that?",
        "Dinah: ( Mumbles ) Okay. Yes, sir, Detective, sir.",
        "Mallet: All right, come on, give me a little sugar. Come on. I'm sorry, I just want you safe. Oh, there it is! There it is. That's the place. All right. Let's rock and roll. ( Gasps ) Man, you scared me. Baby, you got to wait outside by the car. Go on, it's a crisis situation. Come on, go. Thank you. ( Sigh ) Police, freeze! Policeman, policeman, we're puttin' away bad guys... Policeman, policeman we're puttin' 'way bad guys Policeman, policeman we're puttin' 'way bad guys.",
        "Mallet: Uh... hello, everyone. Hi. I'm Detective A.C. Mallet, Springfield P.D. How are you? We got a call that there might be some trouble here.",
        "Minister: As you can see, we're about to have a wedding here.",
        "Mallet: Uh-huh.",
        "Minister: Now, the groom was a little late, but that doesn't seem like a crime just yet, Detective.",
        "Mallet: Father, how much... how much would be a \"little\" late?",
        "Minister: 20 minutes or so. He's getting changed now.",
        "Mallet: Uh-huh, and where would that changing area be?",
        "Minister: Right through there. Second door on the right.",
        "Mallet: Okay, then. Have a nice day. Enjoy. Congratulations. ( Knocks on door ) Hey, Brian? You in there? (Knocks again ) Got a whole church-load of people waiting for you out here.",
        "Sasha: Stay back! I'm warning you, stay back!",
        "Mallet: How you doing? How you doing? Detective Mallet, Springfield P.D. Slow down, easy. What's going on here?",
        "Sasha: This man, if you can call him a man, promised to love me forever. He vowed we'd never be apart, and... I believed him. You see this knife?",
        "Brian: I'm pretty sure he sees the knife, Sasha.",
        "Sasha: Oh, funny. You're always so funny. This is from a very expensive knife set, a gift off our wedding registry. \"Send it back,\" he said. \"Send it all back.\" Well, I did, except for this. This I saved for you, see... I want you to know how it feels to have a knife plunged through your heart, Brian, to have it ripped out!",
        "Mallet: So, excuse me... so, you two were supposed to get married?",
        "Brian: Yes. As you can see, the only problem was, she couldn't cook. I mean, what else could it have been?",
        "Sasha: You were supposed to love me. It's supposed to be me in a wedding dress, not that chick you met at the dry cleaners!",
        "Brian: It was actually at the bagel shop next door.",
        "Sasha: You think this is funny? Are you actually laughing at me...",
        "Mallet: Whoa, whoa. Slow down, it's okay. Slow down, everything's fine. We can work through this. Just put the knife down. I can help you get whatever it is you need. Okay?",
        "Sasha: But I need him to love me again, that's what I need. And if he can't... if he won't... she'll never have you. No one will.",
        "Dinah: Right on, sister! You go! I think you should take that knife and plunge it in his heart, and then cut him up into little pieces. Policeman, policeman, we're puttin' away bad guys... Policeman, policeman, we're puttin' away bad guys Policeman, policeman, we're puttin' away bad guys...",
        "Mallet ( whispers ): Dinah, out. Get out.",
        "Dinah: Is that the best knife you could find?",
        "Mallet: Can you wait in the car, please? Sasha and Brian and I are having a nice little private chat.",
        "Dinah: No, actually, honey, you're trying to cop her down. She can even see that. Men, they think they're so clever.",
        "Sasha: Who are you?",
        "Dinah: I'm Dinah Marler. It's good to meet you. I see you have actually a pretty decent knife there. Now that I look a little bit closer, I... ( laughs ) I think I registered for a set like that when I was going to get married. I mean, they're expensive, but they do cut through anything.",
        "Sasha: You a cop, too?",
        "Dinah: No. No, I am not a cop. I'm more like you than I am him. I stood where you are right now, and... the only difference was, I had a gun in my hand, and these are pretty tough to register for.",
        "Mallet: Okay, thank you for sharing. And we're going to go back to our private little moment...",
        "Sasha: No, I... I want to hear what she has to say. You pulled a gun on someone?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. I didn't just pull it, I used it.",
        "Mallet: Dinah...",
        "Sasha: Let her talk!",
        "Dinah: I killed him.",
        "Sasha: What happened?",
        "Dinah: You really want to know? He didn't love me the way that I wanted him to love me. And I think I figured if I tried to stick around a little bit longer, he'd come around, and he'd start loving me maybe as much as he started loving her.",
        "Sasha: Her?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. My guy left me for a stripper.",
        "Sasha ( softly ): He left you for a stripper?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Didn't have much class. ( Laughs weakly ) But I tell you what, I don't know if I've ever hated anybody as much as I hated that girl. Her name was Cassie. And... I think I wanted them both dead. One, because he loved her more than he loved me. And because of that, I wanted both of them to suffer. And one day, I found myself in a farmhouse. I don't know how, but I... had... something in my hands that was really dangerous.",
        "Sasha: What? The gun?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I had the gun. And I don't know how, but I pulled the trigger, because I was so emotional, and, uh... suddenly, it went off, and... I was aiming for her. But it was him that was falling.",
        "Mallet: You don't have to get into this right now.",
        "Dinah: Sasha, I... I shot him. And I saw him there, just lying there, and it's... it's like slow motion when I try to actually recall it. But he was lying there, and I asked him to talk to me, and I asked him to come back, and that I was sorry. But he didn't respond, and he just laid there and he was dead, and he didn't say a word.",
        "Sasha: He really died?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, he really died. And I tell you something, the minute that I did it, I didn't feel a bit better. I didn't. In fact, I felt sorry. I felt sorry because I had done a terrible thing. Sasha, you probably are going to have another chance, and I think that it's worth it. Because I'm going to tell you something, you cannot make a man love you. No matter how hard you try, you can't. You can have a second chance, Sasha. Now, I know that you don't think you're ever going to love a man as much as you've loved Brian. But you're wrong, and I know that because I was wrong. Now let me tell you something. I saw his brother and his father out there? Guaranteed, he's going to be fat and bald in, like, five years.",
        "Sasha: And you really found someone else?",
        "Dinah: Well, I had to go through a few lemons. But yeah, I found my guy. I found my guy and he loves me so much, I can't stop him from loving me, no matter how much I try to convince him.",
        "Sasha: And you're over the pain.",
        "Dinah: No. No, I'm not, and I doubt I'll ever get over that kind of pain. Because the thing is, Sasha, I mean, as much as I am... having a wonderful guy and things are going great, you never know. I was jealous and I was insecure and... you know what? I'm going to have to fight that, and you're going to have to fight that, probably for the rest of your life, but I mean, you're worth it. You're worth it. And let me tell you something? That's worth it, too.",
        "Sasha: Okay.",
        "Dinah: You're not going to be sorry.",
        "Sasha: I believe you. You can take me in now.",
        "Mallet: Okay. Raphael, could you take her downtown? And, uh, go easy on her, okay? She's had.. she's had a rough night. Thanks.",
        "Brian: ( Sighs ) Thank you. Both of you. If you'd like to stay, you're welcome to.",
        "Mallet: Would you like to watch a wedding?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Minister: The good book tells us that love is patient, love is kind. It does not hold grudges, nor keep records of wrongs. Love always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. The bond of a man and woman is strong, but no power is greater than the healing power of love. If you love someone, you will always be loyal no matter what the cost, because love never fails. God tells us that himself, and he is love. Now, if you're sitting next to someone you love today, I want you to take their hand. And I want you to look into their eyes and say three simple words. Go ahead. Say \"I love you.\"",
        "Mallet: I love you.",
        "Dinah: I love you.",
        "Minister: Something changed, didn't it? You experienced the power. Now, remember, as long as you live by those words, day after day, love will never fail you.",
        "Mallet (whispers): What do you say we, uh, ditch these cameras?",
        "Minister: Now let us acknowledge God's blessing in this ceremony and begin.",
        "Mallet: Any sign of them?",
        "Dinah: No, I think we lost them.",

        "Mallet: Good.",
        "Dinah: Oh, my feet hurt.",
        "Mallet: Hey, I was really impressed the way you talked that woman down. That was...",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs )",
        "Mallet: The way you opened yourself up to her.",
        "Dinah: Yeah... well, you know what, I recognized the look in her eyes. That's the one I've been trying to keep out of my own for a long time.",
        "Mallet: I'm sorry your had to go through that. And I'm even sorrier that my mistake with Harley brought all that back up to you. I just want you to feel safe and secure with me, you know? I want you to trust me.",
        "Dinah: I trust you...",
        "Mallet: And I want you to believe that I'm not going to leave you. I'm not going to let you down.",
        "Dinah: Well, I... I want to believe that, I do. It means a lot to hear that from you. Thank you.",
        "Mallet: You know, saying isn't really doing it, though. Does it, I mean...",
        "Dinah: Doing what? ( Laughs )",
        "Mallet: ( Sigh ) What... why don't we... why don't we do it?",
        "Dinah: Do what?",
        "Mallet: Well, I was... I was standing in the back of the church and I was thinking and I was looking at everything, and I was thinking, I love this girl. I love this girl, and if she loves me...",
        "Dinah: I do. I love you a lot.",
        "Mallet: What's stopping us?",
        "Dinah: From what, Mallet?",
        "Mallet: From... getting married.",

        "Dinah: I could have sworn I just heard you ask me to marry you.",
        "Mallet: I did.",
        "Dinah: Well, if you want to think about it for a few more seconds, I won't bother you.",
        "Mallet: Well, I don't know. You know, I was just... I was standing in that church and... I was watching that couple get married. And I thought, I want to marry Dinah.",
        "Dinah: Are you sure? I mean, have you thought about this?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, of course I've thought about it. I thought about it before. Are you worried that I'm going to make the same mistakes that I did with Harley?",
        "Dinah: No, I didn't say that. I didn't say that.",
        "Mallet: Because I'm not. That won't happen. I want to do it right this time. Okay? Look, we don't have to do this tomorrow or anything, but why don't we do it for real? Why don't we get a ring? And why don't we... why don't we set a date? Why don't we send out an announcement? Why don't we... we'll get one of those goofy pictures in the newspaper, and... did I forget anything?",
        "Dinah: Do you really want this? Do you really want this?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I really do.",
        "Dinah: Even with all my baggage and... and the fact that we don't even know what the next day's going to bring now?",
        "Mallet: I have my own baggage, and I kind of like the surprises.",
        "Dinah: Hey, not all of them. You know, I've got a bad temper.",
        "Mallet: I know.",
        "Dinah: And I... I tend to break things a whole lot, Mallet.",
        "Mallet: I know.",
        "Dinah: And you're not worried at all that they're not just things that I break?",
        "Mallet: I'm not worried.",
        "Dinah: After all that, you still want me?",
        "Mallet: Yes, I do. Dinah Marler, will you marry me? Will you be my wife?",

        "Olivia: What? Nobody. I saw them bring the woman in. She... she had a knife, and she was threatening to carve up her fianc\u00e9, and you talked her down. Scorned women of the world unite, eh?",
        "Dinah: Oh, gee. No, well, you know, I mean... I don't know, I channeled who I used to be, but at least some go came of it.",
        "Marina: Hey, Dinah. I heard what happened. Great job.",
