        "Gus assembled the Spaldings plus Brad Green to let them know that the feds cleared them and everything would be fine; forcing Alan and Phillip to come up with another plan to get rid of Olivia. The noose tightened around Salerno as Harley, Gus and Jeffery put their plan to keep him in town in place. Reva faked psychic visions of doom to encourage him to stay for the festival.",

        "Salerno: (Sighs)",
        "Tony: What is it? Bad news?",
        "Salerno: My horoscope for today. You want to hear it? \"Think twice before starting a big job today and remember, if you want it done right, do it yourself.\" If I'd read that earlier, I might have thought twice about letting Danny try to take out that jerk, O'Neill. I would have done it myself and done it right. It would have been \"bye-bye, Jeffrey O'Neill.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I can't believe this. I can't believe this. Not Edmund. You know, not Edmund. Something's got to be wrong here. Oh, my god.",
        "Jeffrey: What happened?",
        "Cassie: You know, I should go down there and I should have Edmund tell me what he and Alan were talking about. I mean, I should trust him that much. That's exactly what I should do.",
        "Jeffrey: No, no. What you should do is you should calm down. Why don't you sit down, please? Sit down. Tell me, what did Edmund say to upset you like this.",
        "Cassie: They were talking about money.",
        "Jeffrey: Money?",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Jeffrey: What for?",
        "Cassie: A delivery of some kind. Edmund warned Alan to pay up, and Alan said that he would come up with the money and... I can't believe this.",
        "Jeffrey: Here.",
        "Cassie: I can't believe this.",
        "Jeffrey: Here, here.",
        "Cassie: No, I can't... I don't like...",
        "Jeffrey: Try some of this. It'll calm your nerves. Just go ahead. (Sighs)",
        "Cassie: This is terrible.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. Have some water. There you go. Now, try to remember what happened. You went downstairs to the bar. You saw Edmund and Alan in a huddle. Did Edmund see you?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, he saw me.",
        "Jeffrey: So, what happened?",
        "Cassie: He acted like he didn't want me to see him. How could he betray me like this? How could he do this?",
        "Jeffrey: You tell me.",
        "Cassie: I don't know. I don't know. I saw Edmund give Vinnie Salerno a package. Then someone takes a shot at you and I almost get killed, and now I see that Edmund is tight with the prime suspect in a drug trafficking scheme? (Laughs)",
        "Jeffrey: It's all circumstantial, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Now you're defending him?",
        "Jeffrey: I was just reserving judgment, that's all.",
        "Cassie: Can you do the same for me? Can you please convince me that the man I love isn't involved in a criminal conspiracy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: Yeah, I got that. I just wanted to see if there was another message.",
        "Alan: Cassie couldn't get away from us fast enough. Have you two parted ways?",
        "Edmund: Our business is finished, Alan-- or rather, will be, when you hold up your end of the deal.",
        "Alan: Don't you worry, Edmund. You will receive full payment before the festival, as promised.",
        "Edmund: See that you do. We can't afford to have anything go wrong. There's too much at stake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Well, how's \"plan a\" shaping up?",
        "Harley: My contact is on the way. You all set with \"plan b\"?",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: You getting cold feet?",
        "Gus: What, about setting my old man up to take a fall? Maybe a few.",
        "Harley: Well, like you said, innocent until proven guilty.",
        "Gus: Right. Either way, I still need to know. So you just go ahead and rattle Salerno's cage and I'm going to give Alan a false sense of security. I mean, if he's the one supplying the drugs to Salerno-- I can't believe these words are coming out of my mouth-- I will be the one there tomorrow night to nail him.",
        "Alan: Tomorrow, our business association will pay off big time.",
        "Gus: I'm counting on you to see that it does.",
        "Phillip: Have you seen Gus? He left me a message asking me to meet him here.",
        "Alan: Well, he called me, too.",
        "Phillip: Okay. Well, it sounded important. Maybe he's heard something about the investigation.",
        "Alan: Well, the way the investigation is going, they may have thrown the book at us.",
        "Phillip: If they do, Olivia will take the hit. It won't be us. I planted enough incriminating information on her to get rid of her for good.",
        "Alan: Speaking of the devil.",
        "Alexandra: Alan, what in the world is going on?",
        "Brad: Your son dragged the three of us out of a meeting and now he's a no- show.",
        "Gus: Hey. Glad to see you could all make it, folks. I'm here with the results from the attorney general's office. Are you ready for the big news?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Hey. I got here as fast as I could. Is everything okay?",
        "Harley: Everything's fine. Sit down. Drink up. The good stuff.",
        "Reva: Well, thanks. So, what are we drinking to?",
        "Harley: Partnership.",
        "Reva: Really? Whose?",
        "Harley: Ours.",
        "Reva: What's the deal?",
        "Harley: Crime busting.",
        "Reva: No. You're the pi, not me.",
        "Harley: No, no, no, no. Reva, come on. Your instincts are great. That's how you took down Carrie Caruthers.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, that was personal, and I had help.",
        "Harley: But that's the help I need: Your psychic abilities.",
        "Reva: Well, you know what? You're out of luck there because I don't have those abilities anymore.",
        "Harley: No, that's not true. You have a gift.",
        "Reva: Gift or a curse, Harley, it's gone. Don't look at me like that, either. You'll figure something else out.",
        "Harley: Well, no, no, no. I already have. If you can't do the real thing, can you fake it?",
        "Reva: You want me to fake being psychic?",
        "Harley: One time only. Well, I think it'll only be once.",
        "Reva: And it won't matter to you that I'm struck down by lightning because I'm trying to pull a fast one?",
        "Harley: No, because this is for a good cause. This case I'm working on affects all of us, everyone in Springfield.",
        "Reva: Excuse me, could you cue the music, please?",
        "Harley: Reva.",
        "Reva: Harley!",
        "Harley: I'm serious. This is a big deal. We are very close to bringing down vinnie Salerno and the drug ring that is dealing \"d\" on the streets.",
        "Reva: \"D\"? That's from antimonious, right? That's the drug that Caruthers used on Marina, Marah, and Michelle?",
        "Harley: That drug is killing kids. We need your help.",
        "Reva: Who's \"we\"?",
        "Harley: The police. Me. Jeffrey O'Neill.",
        "Reva: O'Neill. O'Neill. He's the one that put you up to this.",
        "Harley: No, no. This was my idea, I swear. And I know it can work.",
        "Reva: I'm not saying I'll do it, but what's the plan?",
        "Harley: Everything is in place to bust vinnie Salerno tomorrow night at the San Cristobel festival, but we can only get him on drug trafficking if we can keep him in town long enough for the bust to go down.",
        "Reva: How do I come into it?",
        "Harley: We need you to convince him that he needs to stay put, that his safety-- no, his whole future-- depends on him being in town tomorrow night.",
        "Reva: How, Harley? How? I don't even know the guy.",
        "Harley: No, but he knows you. He knows you from your show, he knows you from all the press coverage on your psychic abilities, and this is a guy who is very superstitious. He plans his life around his horoscope, I swear.",
        "Reva: So, what? You want me to conjure up some travel advisory?",
        "Harley: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Reva: Lay it out to this sociopath mobster not knowing whether he's going to buy it or not?",
        "Harley: You will be perfectly safe. We are already monitoring the social club. I will be nearby. The police will be nearby.",
        "Reva: Great. Well, that's fine for me, but what about my family, Harley? And my kids. No, I can't afford to put them at that kind of risk.",
        "Harley: They already are. Salerno took a potshot at Jeffrey O'Neill. Cassie got caught in the crossfire.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: You know, you're still in shock from the shooting, Cassie. So you shouldn't be making snap judgments about Edmund.",
        "Cassie: You're just as suspicious as I am.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I'm suspicious of everybody all the time, okay? That's my job. So, don't go looking for things that aren't there.",
        "Cassie: Do you think that I want to believe that Edmund is in business with a mobster and a drug dealer? Do you? I saw him with Alan and Salerno.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, you saw, you saw. Eyewitness accounts are always undependable. They're unreliable because, well, normally the witness is emotionally involved.",
        "Cassie: I didn't have a doubt in my mind about Edmund until you came around asking questions and putting doubts in my mind.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, if you say so.",
        "Cassie: Excuse me, I've never doubted Edmund. Never. Even when everyone told me to cut and run.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, right.",
        "Cassie: Look, I don't doubt that the man had a past, okay? I know, but he has changed.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: He has! I mean, how could I love him as much as I do if he hasn't changed? How could I trust my children with him if he hasn't changed?",
        "Jeffrey: Save it, Mrs. Winslow, okay? Because underneath all of that devotion, you cannot tell me that you haven't been waiting for little Eddie boy to slip up and revert back to type.",
        "Cassie: That's a terrible thing to say. You are such a jerk, Mr. O'Neill.",
        "Jeffrey: Ooh, ouch.",
        "Cassie: How dare you tell me what I feel for Edmund? And what the hell do you know about love?",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, not much.",
        "Cassie: You can say that again.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, and I hope to keep it that way. Ow!",
        "Cassie: Are you okay? Are you all right? Is there something I can get you?",
        "Jeffrey: Oh. Cassie, could you get me some more scotch, please? Please?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I'd like to pour it over your head.",
        "Jeffrey: Wouldn't that be a waste of scotch, Mrs. Winslow? Now, be a good little lass and get me a glass, would you, please? Thank you. (Groans)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Are we going to prison or not?",
        "Gus: Hm. Well, the answer is \"not.\" You're all off the hook.",
        "Alan: Are you serious?",
        "Gus: Mm-hmm. According to the attorney general, you bent the law; you didn't quite break it.",
        "Alexandra: I knew it. The feds came up empty.",
        "Phillip: That's it? All the charges are dropped?",
        "Gus: Yeah. Well, a few minor infractions, that's what I was looking at, and a fine of $25,000.",
        "Alan: Well, that's nothing!",
        "Alexandra: Oh, Alan. Alan, thank heavens this whole thing is over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Emma's future is secure.",
        "Phillip: It always will be. That's one thing you never have to worry about.",
        "Gus: Congratulations, everyone. This is for Ross, compliments of Detective Aitoro.",
        "Alan: So you knew all along, Gus. Right?",
        "Gus: I had a sneaking suspicion.",
        "Alan: Well, then I would like to propose a toast, a toast to my family, if I may. You see, when we stick together, everything always turns out for the best. To family.",
        "Phillip: To family.",
        "Alexandra: Here.",
        "Edmund: Celebrating already? The festival isn't until tomorrow night?",
        "Alexandra: Well, this is a personal celebration.",
        "Alan: Yes. Like the mythical Phoenix, Spaulding has risen from the ashes.",
        "Alexandra: In spite of Gus and Jeffrey O'Neill trying to shut us down, I might add.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Hey, I'm very glad that you proved me wrong.",
        "Brad: This is not over, Aitoro. The feds have to do more than send a letter. There's restitution, reparations.",
        "Gus: Put a sock in it, green.",
        "Olivia: Come on, you're a Spaulding. Don't you care about the hit this company has taken these past few months?",
        "Gus: Well, actually, I'm not really losing any sleep at night. What about you, Phillip? You think that the feds owe Spaulding anything?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: No, not a thing. I think they've done quite enough.",
        "Alan: It's over. That's all that matters.",
        "Reva: Cassie was shot? Where is she? The hospital?",
        "Harley: No, no, no, no. She wasn't hurt, she was just shaken up. Jeffrey was the target. She just gets in the way.",
        "Reva: Well, I have to talk to her.",
        "Harley: I spoke to Jeffrey. He's with her. She's okay.",
        "Reva: Where? Upstairs? Here?",
        "Harley: Do you want to help? Help me put away Vinnie Salerno for good, Reva.",
        "Reva: Josh is going to wring my neck.",
        "Harley: Are you in?",
        "Reva: Yeah. I'm not going to let someone take a potshot at my family and get away with it.",
        "Harley: Exactly.",
        "Reva: Tell me where and when.",
        "Harley: Well, now, and I will personally escort you. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Hi. Could we please see Michelle? We won't be long.",
        "Nurse: Visiting hours are over.",
        "Shayne: Oh, come on. Remember when I was a patient here? You bent the rules a little bit. One night you even let a bunch of my friends sneak in late and bring a pizza.",
        "Nurse: That was different.",
        "Shayne: Look, we won't stay long. We just want Michelle to know that we're here.",
        "Nurse: All right. A few minutes, that's all.",
        "Shayne: You got it.",
        "Marina: Thank you so much. And thank you.",
        "Shayne: For what?",
        "Marina: Being you. Not taking no for an answer.",
        "Shayne: You're welcome.",
        "Marina: What are you doing?",
        "Shayne: You have to ask?",
        "Marina: Not now, Lewis. You've got a job to do.",
        "Shayne: You doing okay?",
        "Marina: She's so still. Hey. We brought you something.",
        "Shayne: Actually, we brought you lots of somethings.",
        "Marina: We didn't think you'd mind if we lifted a few items from your house.",
        "Shayne: And you don't have to worry. We didn't steal any of the valuables.",
        "Marina: Just the photos. Lots of pictures of you and your family. Danny. Everyone sent pictures. Ross and Blake.",
        "Shayne: Oh, yeah. My mom had a million pictures from all the Bauer barbecues.",
        "Marina: And Marah sent you this kimono. Real silk. She designed and made it herself, all the way from Paris. Until we all get to go shopping together again. So, we are going to redecorate this room, which is now done in hospital drab.",
        "Shayne: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. You know what? It's going to be like one of those TV makeover shows. We're going to knock down a few of your walls; we're going to rip up a few of the floorboards.",
        "Marina: Don't listen to him. He's got construction in his blood.",
        "Shayne: Yes, I do. So, where are we going to start?",
        "Marina: We'll start with this. This is a picture that Robbie drew you in nursery school. It's of your garden at home, because he knows how much you love spending your summers out there.",
        "Shayne: It's a good idea. Robbie's masterpiece will definitely be in a prominent place. The best spot. Let's get started.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: There you go, fill her up. No, I'm good. Here's to my brother. May he take this company right back to the top.",
        "Phillip: Thank you, Gus. I'll do my best.",
        "Alan: Well, Olivia, this is wonderful news. Now you can spend 24-7 with Emma. You can be a real stay-home mother.",
        "Alexandra: Of course, we'll be forever grateful for you stepping up to the plate in Spaulding's hour of need.",
        "Alan: Yes, we will, but we will no longer need you to shore up the family business.",
        "Olivia: Well, I wouldn't dream of stepping down now, now that I've won their respect and trust of the board and all our associates. And Phillip, he and I are a team. Together we're going to restore Spaulding's good name and bring this company back to its rightful prominence. Isn't that right, sweetheart?",
        "Phillip: This is no time to talk about business. We're celebrating.",
        "Olivia: Where are you going?",
        "Phillip: Oh, to get some air.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Ah, young love.",
        "Olivia: I'll be right back.",
        "Alan: That won't be necessary, Olivia. I will go.",
        "Brad: Don't you worry your pretty little head. The men-folk are back in charge.",
        "Olivia: Don't take your job security for granted, brad. I'm still in charge.",
        "Brad: I'm not afraid of you, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: Big mistake.",
        "Edmund: Well, I'm counting on all of you to be there tomorrow night.",
        "Alexandra: Well, of course. Spaulding's the biggest sponsor. We'll all be there. You too, Gus?",
        "Gus: I wouldn't miss it for the world. I'm sure it's going to turn out to be a heck of a night.",
        "Edmund: Well, I'd drink to that if I had a glass, but right now, I have too many things to take care of for the festival, so good night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: I know it's good news, but everything was in place to get Olivia out of Spaulding and out of our lives, and now we're stuck with her.",
        "Alan: Why don't we focus on the good news? The federal investigation is over. Now you can push through those projects at Spaulding that you've always wanted to do. They can happen now.",
        "Phillip: No, they can't. I can't start on any of them until I get rid of her.",
        "Alan: Well, there's more than one way of getting rid of her, Phillip.",
        "Phillip: I'm listening.",
        "Alan: You could divorce her. We could buy her off, send her out of town. I mean, it lacks melodrama, but it's very effective.",
        "Phillip: No, I can't do that because if she goes, Emma goes with her. I just got out of a psychiatric hospital. There's no court in the world that's going to give me custody of her, and I can't lose my daughter. Not again.",
        "Alan: Emma is a Spaulding. She will be raised as a Spaulding.",
        "Phillip: Right. So I'm tied to Olivia forever?",
        "Alan: No. We still have one more card to play. You know, you may be a first- rate executive, but you still have a lot to learn from your old man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: You know, last time I saved your life, you treated me a little bit better than this. You gave me free mints on the pillow. I had free room service. I was upgraded.",
        "Cassie: I was grateful.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, for, like, ten minutes, you were grateful.",
        "Cassie: More like a week, okay? But then you showed your true colors. You started being a jerk again. Talk about reverting to type.",
        "Jeffrey: And what's that supposed to mean?",
        "Cassie: Oh, my god, you were snapping at me all the time, you were growling at my kids. My kids were terrified of you.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, yeah. Your kids were really terrified of me. RJ is really terrified of me.",
        "Cassie: (Laughs)",
        "Jeffrey: He won't leave me alone.",
        "Cassie: Well, that's just because of your face. He didn't realize that the personalities didn't match. And then your attitude. Excuse me. Saying \"hello\" to you in the morning is like walking into a deep freeze. Still is, some days.",
        "Cassie: Why do you think we get on each others' nerves so much?",
        "Jeffrey: I don't know. Expectations, maybe.",
        "Cassie: Expectations?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, expectations. We both remind each other of someone. I remind you of Richard, and my behavior is not exactly like his, is it? So you get upset. Animosity sets in, and you start taking potshots at me for no reason at all.",
        "Cassie: Oh, come on. Now, that's a laundry list.",
        "Jeffrey: Just trying to clarify things.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Who do I remind you of?",
        "Phillip: Coming up, on \"Guiding Light.\"",
        "Cassie: Thanks again for saving my life.",
        "Jeffrey: Ditto. You saved mine.",
        "Marina: I love you so much. I never want to take that love for granted.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Killing time while your shirt's in the wash?",
        "Cassie: There was a shooting. Jeffrey was almost killed.",
        "Edmund: Almost?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, almost. Close, but no cigar. Sorry to disappoint you there, Ed.",
        "Cassie: Be careful, would you?",
        "Jeffrey: I'm fine. Now, my assassin was a lousy shot. Good thing.",
        "Cassie: Well, he almost hit me. If Jeffrey hadn't pushed me to the ground, I could have been killed.",
        "Edmund: My god, Cassie. Are you all right?",
        "Cassie: Yes, thanks to Jeffrey I'm fine.",
        "Edmund: What were you doing in the line of fire?",
        "Cassie: I was...",
        "Jeffrey: She was chasing me down, trying to get the last word in in one of our arguments. Good thing, too, because she probably scared the sniper away.",
        "Edmund: Any idea who's trying to kill you?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you know, it could be any one of my fans in this town. As a matter of fact, what were you doing earlier?",
        "Cassie: You know who it was. It was one of Salerno's boys.",
        "Edmund: I warned you about this, Cassie. This is exactly the kind of incident I'm afraid of.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, thanks for the talk.",
        "Edmund: You should check into a hospital, O'Neill.",
        "Jeffrey: No, no, no, no. It was just Salerno getting off a warning shot. Nothing to worry about.",
        "Cassie: I think you should be careful.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I think you should be careful, too.",
        "Cassie: Thanks again for saving my life.",
        "Jeffrey: Ditto. You saved mine. Here, I'm no hero, and don't be so sure you know who all the bad guys are.",
        "Edmund: Thank god you're all right, Cassie. If anything happened to you, I don't know what I'd do. Are you all right? Cassie, is there something you're not telling me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Okay, Michelle. Time to wake up. See all these pictures? All these people who love you?",
        "Shayne: Yeah, you better listen to her, Michelle, because when I was here, she was in there kicking my butt every day until I walked out.",
        "Marina: Tough love works wonders. Romance is in the air, Michelle. Think about it. Summer nights, long walks on the beach, holding hands. Tell me you don't miss that. Sure you do. Danny's waiting for you, Michelle. Look, no matter where you are right now, you can find your way back to him, to all of us. We all miss you so much, Michelle.",
        "Shayne: And trust me, it's no fun hanging out here. You know, you have the nurses changing your IV, putting thermometers in your mouth, mumbling all this medical stuff.",
        "Marina: So you get your act together and come back to us. Hey, come home, Michelle.",
        "Nurse: Nice work, but it's time to go.",
        "Marina: I love you. I'll see you tomorrow. Can you just hold me? (Sobs) we are so lucky, you know that? I love you so much. I never want to take that love for granted. Ever.",

        "Harley: What did I miss?",
        "Detective: Big excitement. Salerno sent somebody to get a pizza.",
        "Harley: Oh, good. Why don't you take a break? I'll cover for a while.",
        "Detective: Stay awake.",
        "Harley: That is not going to be a problem, because the fun is about to start. Okay, Reva. Do your stuff.",

        "Tony: Okay. Phone it in, please? You don't need to be here, Reva.",
        "Reva: I had... what are you, embarrassed by your place of business? Is that what this is?",
        "Tony: Okay, listen, if this is about my life, the way I'm living my life...",
        "Reva: No.",
        "Tony: I'm sorry.",
        "Reva: It's not, it's not. This is about repaying a debt. You helped Marah when she was accused of murder. Now I want to help you.",
        "Tony: Do it by leaving, all right?",
        "Reva: I've had a premonition, Tony. Of danger. And the images just won't stop, and that's what brought me here.",
        "Tony: Okay, so what? Somebody's coming after me? It's nothing new. All right? Please, let's go.",
        "Reva: It's not you.",
        "Tony: What do you mean, it's not me.",
        "Reva: It's someone else. It's someone close to you, but... it's so close that I can feel it... them. It's like the minute I walked in here, I sensed a presence.",
        "Salerno: Antonio, I need you...",
        "Reva: It's him.",
        "Salerno: You brought a broad in here? What are you thinking, man? I know you. The television show, right?",
        "Reva: That's right. I'm Reva Lewis.",
        "Salerno: Yeah. You're the psychic. You found that kid that everybody thought was dead.",
        "Reva: So you've heard about my work with parapsychology.",
        "Salerno: Oh, yeah. I'm a student of the science, myself.",
        "Reva: No.",
        "Salerno: My mother, God rest her soul, she reads tea leaves.",
        "Reva: Then you'll understand when I say I have a message for you.",
        "Salerno: What do you take me for, huh? You work for the police.",
        "Reva: No, I work for whoever needs my help. And the messages just won't stop until I make contact with the person who needs to hear them.",
        "Tony: She means well.",
        "Reva: Are you planning a trip? Is there some sort of trip that you're going to be taking?",
        "Salerno: You're the one with the answers. You tell me.",
        "Reva: Just a few minutes, that's all I need.",
        "Salerno: Sure. Why not? I'm curious. Tony, where are your manners? Come on, get the lady a chair, huh?",

        "Jeffrey: Sorry. Has the band started?",
        "Harley: Oh, it's just warming up.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, I'll take over from here.",
        "Harley: Oh, come on. I don't want to miss the good stuff.",
        "Jeffrey: I need you to talk to Gus, and then report back to me on the Spaulding's. Ow!",
        "Harley: Are you okay?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, I'm fine. Nothing that nailing Vinnie Salerno won't cure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Salerno: So, what's with the travel advisory, Mrs. Lewis? Huh?",
        "Reva: Well, at first, I didn't know where the message was coming from, just that it had something to do with Tony, someone close to him.",
        "Salerno: Close to Tony. I mean, that could be anybody. Could be Danny.",
        "Reva: Does Danny play cards here every Friday night? Sit in that chair? Use a wooden match to puncture the tips of his cigars?",
        "Salerno: Go on.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, he's hooked. Now reel him in nice and slow.",
        "Reva: Men rushing in, blaming you for something. But I don't know what it is. And there's a car and someone sitting behind the wheel, but the car isn't moving, but there's danger. Great danger.",

        "Alan: Exactly.",
        "Phillip: But how is that enough?",
        "Alan: Olivia forced to you sign that proxy at raven wood. Now how do you think that's this going to look to board, huh? This woman with this unblemished business record who turns out to be a heartless money-grubber. She used you when you were very vulnerable, and she showed no mercy whatsoever.",
        "Phillip: She'll just swear that she was doing it to protect me and our child.",
        "Alan: Yeah, but it won't work. No, no, she sold your stocks and your bonds that rightfully belong to you and your children. Now that is fraud in any man's book. Believe me, the board won't be able to get rid of her fast enough. The honeymoon is over.",
        "Phillip: She'll fight it.",
        "Alan: That's why you have to get to the D.A. And set up a meeting immediately. Report this crime. It is your civic duty, Phillip.",
        "Phillip: You know, you're right. A crime has been committed. Failure to report it would make me an accessory, wouldn't it.",
        "Alan: Yes, all you have to do is play the anguished husband who didn't want to turn in his wife.",

        "Cassie: I don't need a doctor. Jeffery was the only one who was hurt.",
        "Edmund: I don't care if Jeffery O'Neil wants to live on the edge, but he has no right to put you in the line of fire.",
        "Cassie: Don't blame him, Edmund. Okay? He didn't do anything. I was upset and I walked right into it.",
        "Edmund: Upset about what?",
        "Cassie: It's not important.",
        "Edmund: Well, it's important to me.",

        "Edmund: Something you could tell Jeffrey O'Neill about, but you can't tell me? Cassie. Tell me. You've always been able to tell me anything. Come on, you can tell me what you saw.",
        "Edmund: How can I help you, Cassie, if I don't know what you saw?",
        "Cassie: It's over now. I'd just like to forget it.",
        "Edmund: Are you angry at me for some reason?",
        "Cassie: No, I just don't want to relive it. That's all.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I don't mean to be insensitive, but you've got to talk to me.",
        "Cassie: You know, I just really should get up. I should. Because there are hundreds of things to do for the festival.",
        "Edmund: All right, all right, all right. Just take care of yourself, and I will take care of everything else. Cassie, this is at least one of the most important nights of my life. And it's going to mean absolutely nothing without you by my side. Everything I am, everything I've become, I owe to you.",
        "Cassie: Edmund, did you have to do too much to win my love?",
        "Edmund: Everything I am, everything I've done, everything I've become, and it was all worth it. Why don't you go ahead and sleep for now?",

        "Marina: Yeah, Shayne picked out some wonderful music for you.",
        "Shayne: To remind you of Danny.",
        "Marina: Now you just think about dancing with Danny and all you have to live for, and come home to us.",

        "Gus: We did it. We're a good team, a very good team.",
        "Harley: Yes, but let's not jump the gun. The jury's still out on Reva.",
        "Gus: Salerno didn't shoot Reva in the head, so it looks pretty good.",
        "Harley: Let's not get ahead of ourselves, even though the Spaulding's are celebrating.",
        "Gus: Yeah, it looks like they bought. They're running up a champagne bill that I have to pay for.",
        "Harley: Hey, it's going to be worth it, if they let their guard down. The bust is going through tomorrow night as planned.",
        "Gus: Well, good. I hope so.",
        "Harley: Are you ready to do this, if it turns out Alan's our man?",
        "Gus: I just need to know, you know, at this point I just need to know.",
        "Harley: I know. Alan has a serious case of corporate greed, but I can't see him getting into bed with vinnie Salerno.",
        "Gus: I hope you're right. Why don't you call O'Neill, see how Reva's doing.",
        "Harley: Yeah right. Hey, at least this is one thing we don't have to worry about. You know, no matter what happens with vinnie Salerno tonight, at least she's not in danger. Reva is perfectly safe.",

        "Salerno: I know a con job when I hear one.",
        "Reva: Fine, it's your life, not mine. But this message... the messages. Have you thought about the fact that they could be coming from your mother? She may be trying to protect her son?",

        "Salerno: Talk fast.",
        "Reva: I can't even breathe with you breaking my arms.",
        "Salerno: I am warning you, lady.",
        "Reva: Okay. Thank you. I just... I need a minute because the images, they stop if I'm not centered. Okay. What I'm getting is that the information about the car was delivered deliberately to hit a nerve, so that you would pay attention to everything that's said here. Does that make any sense?",
        "Jeffrey: All right, stand down everyone. We're back on track.",
        "Reva: An eye for an eye. What does that mean? Oh, I see.",
        "Salerno: What? What is that?",
        "Reva: Because of the bad vibrations that you've been putting out into the world, you need to be extremely careful. Don't travel. Stay in your chair or sit. Play cards, smoke cigars, but do not travel. It could be hazardous, it could be life threatening.",
        "Salerno: Why? Who's after me?",
        "Reva: I'm sorry, but... the images are gone.",
        "Salerno: Well, maybe if you rest.",
        "Reva: No, I... Tony, can I have my purse? You really can't, you can't... thank you sweetheart. You can't force it. If it's not there, you can't force it.",
        "Salerno: Hey, hey, hey, hey. You're not leaving.",
        "Jeffrey: No Vinnie, she's not leaving. There's still one more thing.",
        "Reva: There's something else Mr. Salerno. The pizza... the pizza that you order. You order it from Chinelli's, is that right?",
        "Salerno: That's amazing. Now how do you know that?",
        "Reva: You don't have to be psychic to read the name on the box. But I am getting something from this. It's... for the next day or so, order your pizza from someplace else.",
        "Salerno: But I love Chinelli's. They get the crust just the way I like it.",
