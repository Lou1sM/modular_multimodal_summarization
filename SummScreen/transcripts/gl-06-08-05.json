        "Buzz: \"Dear Harley, I don't know where to send you this letter, but somehow just putting the words on paper makes me feel closer to you. Zach's first grade graduation is next week. His class voted him best smile. Of course he won. It's your smile. Jude is growing so fast I had to buy him new sneakers again. Now if he'd only learn to tie them. I think I'm doing okay with them I hope. Whenever I'm lost, I ask myself, what would Harley do? I'd sell my soul to have you back home safe and sound with us kiddo. But until then, at least I feel a little better knowing you're not alone. Gus loves you.\"",

        "Lizzie: Why are you wearing that?",

        "Gus: We know what he looks like.",

        "Harley: Enough. Enough with the picky stuff.",

        "Harley: The bright side? Elaborate.",
        "Gus: This is the greatest adventure of our life. You and me and the open road. We've got over a dozen super crunchy cones back there. This is a quest for justice and truth. It doesn't get better than that. All right, it gets better than that. But you know what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying?",
        "Harley: I know what you're saying. I know what you're saying. You're over the edge. Maybe I should be drinking this. What's in here?",
        "Gus: I don't know, but it's making me hungry. Give me an ice cream cone. Give me a raspberry vanilla swirl. I like those. You have to see the ice cream at the end of the tunnel. Nothing ventured, nothing frozen. We're going to find the goatee guy in New York City. We're going to find him because he's the answer to our prayers. I don't think Alexandra will say anything, either. I think she'll keep her mouth shut.",

        "Zach: A lady said something really mean about mommy.",
        "Buzz: Oh, and that hurt, didn't it? What did we say we'd do when that happened? What did we say? The stuff people say about your mom doesn't count. Only the stuff that we know is true, right? In here. In here.",
        "Zach: I want to run away like mommy did. What happens if she never comes back?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: You knew Michelle would be back. I guess they just picked up right where they left off. French toast. Low blow, Santos. That's my favorite brunch food and you know it. I've got to get out of here.",
        "Danny: What's the matter? You didn't like the French toast? Come on, Marina, you didn't think I'd know you'd follow me here? Now we can finally enjoy that weekend in Chicago that we've been talking about.",
        "Marina: I don't understand. You did this for me? But Michelle...",
        "Danny: Michelle who? Michelle's in Africa, Marina. How many times do I have to tell you that I want to be with you? Now, will you give us a chance? I ordered that French toast for nothing?",

        "Lizzie: Well, you have to be prepared. I mean, I think I've got everything. I've got sandwiches, lots of C.Ds, I've got drinks, chips. Over here I've got hats and sunscreen and...a chest.",
        "Coop: What?",
        "Lizzie: Nothing. It's just an ice chest.",
        "Coop: Ice chest? Lizzie, we don't have an ice chest.",
        "Lizzie: Do you think we should have one?",
        "Coop: No, please. No. We've got enough stuff here already. If we need anything we'll just grab it from Company.",
        "Lizzie: Good.",
        "Coop: All right. What have we got? Oh, you've got to be kidding me. ( Laughs ) Good selection. I love this C.D.",

        "Zach: Go get her, grandpa.",
        "Buzz: I wish I could. She'll find her way home, she will. And all this bad stuff will seem like it never happened. You know those comics Uncle Frank gets you? Now in those comics, who wins out in the end, good or evil?",
        "Zach: Good.",
        "Buzz: You betcha. And you know what? I forgot. Frank got you a new comic. It's in the kitchen. Come on. I told Harley I was okay with those kids but I am hanging on by a threat. I told her that in here, you know? In a letter, which I can't send because I don't know where she is. Crazy, huh?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, no. It's not crazy at all.",
        "Buzz: I want her back more than anything else I've ever wanted in my life. She never murdered anyone!",
        "Alexandra: No.",
        "Buzz: She and the kids are suffering so much. What if they never find the guy that killed Phillip?",
        "Alexandra: Look, Buzz there's something that I need to tell you....",

        "Harley: When we met, did you ever imagine that we would be here in an ice cream truck on the way to New York City?",
        "Gus: I knew the ride would be interesting.",
        "Harley: ( Laughs )",
        "Gus: Well I knew it would be an incredible journey. And you do not disappoint.",
        "Harley: See, now, if you were smart you would have seen trouble and you would have turned around and walked away.",
        "Gus: No, I saw trouble. Damn prettiest trouble I ever did see. ( Laughs )",
        "Harley: You are such a romantic.",
        "Gus: You're such a pessimist. Come on, hon. Where's the love? Where's the trust? Where's the faith, huh?",
        "Harley: It's here.",
        "Gus: Where?",
        "Harley: It's right here.",
        "Gus: Right there?",
        "Harley: Give me your hand. It's this thing. It's between us. It's all I have. It's everything to me. No, no, I mean... I mean you are everything to me.",

        "Alexandra: Call off those bounty hunters this minute and give harley at least a fighting chance.",
        "Alan: If I don't, what will you do?",
        "Gus: This if they pull us over, I'm going to do all the talk. I'm going to say I took you against your will.",

        "Coop: This is nice. This is really nice. Good idea.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I... you know, I thought it would be a good idea. But that suit. Oh, wow.",
        "Coop: I only wore the suit because I was going to try to take you out to lunch at the country club. But this is so much better. Being outside, that is.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. Well, you know, the country club would have been a great idea, too. It's... I don't know, maybe we can do that next time. Not to say that, you know, there's going to be a next time or there has to be a next time.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: What the heck are we doing here? I mean, you and I... this. Usually we can't even shut each other up.",
        "Lizzie: That's because we're always fighting.",
        "Coop: Not always.",
        "Lizzie: 99% of the time.",
        "Coop: 99% is not 100%.",
        "Lizzie: You never agree with me.",
        "Coop: You're always talking in absolutes. There are plenty of things that you and I have agreed upon, but forget it.",
        "Lizzie: Forget what? The subject or the date?",
        "Coop: I did not say the date. I just... if we can't talk as normal people, and we certainly can't fight, what's the point? What the heck are we doing here? What are we supposed to do?",
        "Lizzie: You know, um, I... maybe we could talk about business. We have that in common, don't we?",
        "Coop: Yeah. ( Laughs ) yeah. Yes, we could. What do you think of the place? I mean, I've made a couple changes here and there.",
        "Lizzie: All of them good.",

        "Lizzie: Yes, I like them 100%.",
        "Coop: ( Laughs ) Good. Well, I'm glad because I've been thinking about making a few other changes. I was thinking about taking the specialty board and I was going to move it to where Roxy's portraits are so people can see it.",
        "Lizzie: Where are Roxy's portraits going to go?",
        "Coop: I don't know. Whatever. The trash?",

        "Lizzie: That's good. You're not getting it.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, I didn't need to ask because, well, frankly, I don't have to anymore. You gave me the keys to the restaurant, which means that I am in control now.",
        "Lizzie: Not gonna happen. I gave you the keys because I was going to Switzerland for six months. It's not happening anymore. Sorry, you're stuck.",

        "Lizzie: We always said we don't want to be like our family and we try so hard not to.",
        "Coop: So... so let's not do it anymore. Every time we catch ourselves going into one of these fights and into that area, we just won't and that's all we have to do.",

        "Marina: Okay, considering. It's really hard to think about anything but that.",
        "Zane: Poor little Zach and Jude. Especially Zach. Losing his dad and now this. Does she call them? Your Aunt Harley? Sorry, none of my business. I know she's on the run and even if you know anything you can't... can't say it. But I just hope for the kids' sake she's at least called them. Called you guys to let you know she's okay.",
        "Marina: She hasn't called.",
        "Zane: Really. She was such a great mom. You'd think she wanted-to-hear her kids' voices. All the news reports say her boyfriend is with her, Gus. What do you think?",

        "Zane: Gus came from Chicago originally, didn't he?",
        "Marina: I'm sorry, Zane, what did you say you were doing here exactly at this hotel?",
        "Zane: I'm here on business.",
        "Marina: What kind of business.",
        "Zane: Sales.",
        "Marina: What kind of sales?",
        "Zane: Computer. Software.",
        "Marina: Interesting. Look, it's been great catching up but I have to go.",

        "Danny: Um, no, actually my girlfriend decide to skip the food and go to the spa instead.",
        "Man: You mean the pretty redheaded lady? I just saw her. She's in the lounge talking with a gentleman.",

        "Alan: I told you what I would do to you if you tried to hold me up.",
        "Man: You're in no position to make threats, Alan. Get in that private jet of yours, fly to New York and bring me double what you gave me last time.",
        "Alan: Double?",
        "Man: Unless you'd rather go to prison, double. You know where to find me.",
        "Alexandra: Alan, I want you to listen to me. Do you hear me? I want you to listen-to-me. Do you know what I have been doing for the last half hour? Do you know? I've been standing in there helping Buzz to try to quell that boy's fears because he has lost both of his parents, both of them. And it's all because of you, you. And you stand there like some stupid hypocrite and pretend and say that you love that child! That child is our family, too.",
        "Alan: Would you calm down, Alexandra, and get to the point!",
        "Alexandra: My point is you... you call off those bounty hunters this minute and you give Harley at least a fighting chance!",
        "Alan: And if I don't, what will you do?",
        "Alexandra: I have the bloody gloves that you wore that proves you shot Phillip. All it's going to take is one word from me, Alan, and that mother of that child is going to come home safely.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: I think you should really know by now that I would never quit. That I would never give up on you. And you, my friend, you're being very negative sometimes, but I know that you wouldn't quit, either. And I swear I thought that we learned this lesson. I thought we learned this very hard lesson in a day that... forget it.",
        "Harley: No. No. Out. I want to hear what you have to say. Say it.",
        "Gus: I thought that we learned this lesson about quitting on the day of our wedding. The day that we were supposed to have our wedding. And we could have, you know? And things could have been very different if you were just able to look forward. Would you like to know how it should have gone? You saw the surveillance tape of Alex and Alan and me the wine cellar and you confronted me and I... I 'fessed up to it and, granted, it was after the fact but you were furious. You called me every name in the book and it was over. Well, here's what should have happened. You shouldn't have bailed on me. You shouldn't have left me. Because I never left you. So we did get married that day. We got married because we still loved each other. We don't know how not to love each other. And it was rocky, but we did... we did rebuild that trust. And we had ourselves a fantastic year, you and me and Jude and Zach. And that, that's the way it should... that's the way it should have gone.",
        "Harley: But it didn't happen that way.",

        "Lizzie: Yeah, you're right, it'll never work.",
        "Coop: Well, of course it can work if we both want it to. So all we have to do is just set up a couple serious ground rules.",
        "Lizzie: Here we go again.",
        "Coop: Like a dress code.",
        "Lizzie: A dress code?",
        "Coop: Absolutely. We should set up a dress code. I think you need to be in this bikini whenever you're around me.",
        "Lizzie: ( Laughs ) As long as you don't ever wear that suit again.",
        "Coop: Guaranteed. But I'm going to need you to smile at me at least a couple dozen times a day.",
        "Lizzie: Only if you smile back.",
        "Coop: As long as I can take you out to dinner sometimes.",
        "Lizzie: Promise it won't be at the country club?",
        "Coop: I can guarantee it. It has to be someplace that allows you to wear that bikini.",
        "Lizzie: You are way too infatuated with this bikini!",

        "Lizzie: 59 seconds.",

        "Marina: No, I haven't been in the mood to be social Zane, with everything going on with my Aunt Harley. Particularly about everyone who's after her. I mean, the cops I understand, but bounty hunters. As far as I'm concerned, those people are the scum of the earth.",
        "Zane: I wouldn't know.",
