        "Lizzie finds Coop's journal in his room and one entry reads that he is sad that he cannot share his life with the woman for whom he cares: Ava. Frank asks Olivia to move in with him and she tells him she cannot; not now. They make love and he is very content. Later, she goes to CO2 and tells Buzz that she blew it with Frank. As Buzz and she are talking, she touches his face and Frank walks by just in time to see this. He looks sad and hurt and walks away. Beth bribes Jonathan with a $100,000 check to leave town. Josh finds the check, tears it up and tells Jonathan that he cannot leave town, then proceeds to find Beth and bawls her out for trying to bribe his family.",
        "Reva, at the hospital, eavesdrops on Lizzie's conversation with the sonogram nurse. She phones Buzz, disguises her voice and leaves a message for Henry Cooper that Lizzie's sonogram has been canceled. She phones Jonathan to come to the hospital now. Jonathan arrives, walks into Lizzie's room and Reva shoves a chair under the door, preventing him from leaving. He sees the monitor during the sonogram and says, very intrigued, \"Is that the heartbeat\"?"

        "Ava: Now go ahead and eat some healthy food with that, would you? Thanks.",
        "Frank: Thank you.",
        "Buzz: Frank. It's great having you hang around here again.",
        "Frank: Well, it's great being somewhere where everyone knows your name.",
        "Buzz: Why so quiet today?",
        "Frank: I just got a lot on my mind. Been thinking a lot about Gus and Harley and, well, I've got my own stuff going on.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, I mean, those two, after all they've been through, you'd think they'd find some common ground and forgive each other. They should be just happy they're alive, for God's sake.",
        "Frank: Well, I don't think they realize how great they really do have it.",
        "Buzz: Most of us don't.",
        "Frank: Yeah. I do. At least, I think I'm starting to feel that way. Oh, Pop, Olivia makes me feel like I can do anything, you know? ( Laughs ) And to think I almost pushed her away because...",
        "Buzz: Because of some old idiot.",
        "Frank: Well, yeah. No offense, Pop, but that would have been the stupidest move of my life. Look, I know you still have feelings for her. But it doesn't bother me anymore, because I want more. And tonight I'm going to do something about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: We have people that can do that, you know.",
        "Coop: Oh, I don't mind. I'm not exactly one of those \"We have people to do that\" kind of guys myself.",
        "Lizzie: Right.",
        "Coop: Um... the sonogram is not for a while. I mean, I didn't get the time wrong, did I?",
        "Lizzie: No, I just... wanted to say hi. And if you want to bet on what we're going to have, five bucks says it's a girl. It's going to be a girl.",
        "Coop: ( Laughs )",
        "Lizzie: ( Laughs )",
        "Coop: Well, my dad says, as long as it has ten fingers and ten toes, you're lucky. But I'm pretty sure with our kid, it'd still be pretty cool if they had 11.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, they might. You want to hang out before the sonogram? Maybe get some ice cream or something?",
        "Coop: Um... maybe. Actually, I have to run downstairs, though, and make sure that we have enough people to cover the shifts today.",
        "Lizzie: Well, we will be waiting here. Can you believe that? We'll be waiting. We're plural now! ( Laughs )",
        "Coop: Yes, we are. Be right back, okay?",
        "Lizzie: Okay. ( Sighs ) I need another box. \"People say everything you take for granted in life will suddenly change and become magical once your baby arrives. Things smell better, taste better, look different, especially once your baby experiences those same things for the first time. Maybe that'll happen to me, too. The sad irony is I can't share this exciting time with the woman that I care most about, Ava.\"",

        "Coop: Yeah. Have fun on your date tonight.",
        "Ava: ( Laughs ) Thanks. Have fun at your sonogram.",

        "Ava: No, don't.",
        "Coop: What?",
        "Ava: Please, okay? For both of us?",
        "Coop: Hey, guys.",
        "Josh: Hey, Coop! I heard some big news about you. You're going to be a dad, is that right?",
        "Coop: Yeah, that's what they tell me.",
        "Josh: Ah... well, are you going to have a boy or a girl, or do you know yet?",
        "Coop: We're actually going later on today, so we should be finding out soon.",
        "Josh: Great. Good luck to you.",
        "Coop: Thank you. Enjoy.",
        "Josh: Sure. You know, back in my day, you had to wait until the baby came out before you found out what sex it was, but that was a long time ago.",
        "Coop: ( Laughs )",
        "Reva: Yeah, now you get to find out all kinds of things.",
        "Josh: Yeah. Lizzie, right? Yikes. He's a good kid, though, Coop. I think he'll be a good dad.",

        "Jonathan: You and Coop-- cut it with a knife, huh?",
        "Ava: You know what? I am so not in the mood for you right now.",
        "Jonathan: Well, I was the first person to help you when you got to this town, so I feel a little responsible for you, and I want to make sure you're not getting a raw deal.",
        "Ava: You want to do me a favor? You want to help me out? Stay out of my business.",
        "Beth: You know, Jonathan... I think Ava might have a point. You should mind your own business.",
        "Jonathan: Maybe that's what I'm doing.",
        "Beth: You know, if I were you, I would stay as far away from Lizzie and her baby as possible.",
        "Jonathan: Would you?",
        "Beth: Yes, I would. And I might have a little something to help you do that. It's time for you to go away.",
        "Jonathan: That is a lot of zeroes. You hate me this much, huh?",
        "Beth: You know the truth about Lizzie's baby.",
        "Jonathan: What, the fact that it's my baby?",
        "Beth: ( Laughs ) You know, Jonathan, I'm not your mother.",
        "Jonathan: Obviously.",
        "Beth: I don't care about this attitude that people call your rebellious streak. No, what I do care about is my daughter and her baby. That child is ours.",
        "Jonathan: Yours? That is so Spaulding.",
        "Beth: You don't love Lizzie. You love Tammy. You claim this child, and you'll lose Tammy. Look, I've been where you are. It's not a good place to be. What am I offering you? I'm offering you a life of freedom with the woman that you love. Now, you nearly tore your family apart fighting for Tammy. Well, now it is time to step up and take what you fought for. Do it for Tammy.",

        "Reva: It's... it's Jonathan. What's new?",
        "Josh: Well, what happened?",
        "Reva: He and Tammy want to move away. Go someplace else. You probably think that's a good thing.",
        "Josh: Well, no, actually. Not if it upsets you, I don't.",
        "Reva: I just want things to be better for him, you know? For everyone. I mean, I look around and I... I want good things for the people I love. I want things to be right, you know? There's so much time wasted on mistakes and fear... and I just want to help.",
        "Josh: People have to live their own lives, Reva, make their own decisions.",
        "Reva: You mean I can't save someone from screwing it all up?",
        "Josh: ( Laughs ) No, I'm sorry, you can't.",
        "Reva: Dang.",
        "Josh: You can't save the world, but if it's any consolation at all, you saved me. And I know if you were to ask Billy, he would say the same thing-- you saved him. And the truth is, where would Jonathan be without you?",
        "Reva: You know something? You're right. We all have our own destiny. I'm just glad you're mine. I have... I have so much that I have to get done today, and you have to get back to work, so... I'll call you later.",

        "Coop: Are you... looking for something?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, I was... I was checking out your furniture. Are you going to move this yourself or should we get a mover?",
        "Coop: Um... what? I...",
        "Lizzie: Well, I... I thought that you would want to have some of your stuff at the house. I mean, if you don't, we have tons of stuff.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, look, okay. I told you before that I'm not ready to move in just yet, okay?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I know. I don't know why I keep torturing myself, okay? You're not ready to move in. When do you think you will be?",
        "Coop: ( Laughs ) Well, we certainly do have some time before the baby gets here, so... there's no rush.",
        "Lizzie: No. I think I'm just anxious.",
        "Coop: I know.",
        "Lizzie: I'm not trying to pressure you.",
        "Coop: It's not pressure. Stop. You're not pressuring me. I mean, this was my idea, remember? I want to do this. It's just that... there are some things that I need to sort out first.",
        "Lizzie: Sort out? Okay. Uh... whenever you're ready.",
        "Coop: Tell you what, I need to grab another box for some more baby stuff. I think there's one in the storage room, so... I'll bring those up. Come on. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Beth: Hello?",
        "Lizzie: Can I ask you something?",
        "Beth: Lizzie! You'll never guess what I'm looking at on my wrist right now.",
        "Lizzie: Um, if it's from granddad, a leash?",
        "Beth: You know me better than that.",
        "Lizzie: I would like to pretend that I can be mature about everything that I'm going through, but actually right now I don't even think that it'll make a difference.",
        "Beth: Honey, I told you that I would take care of things and I have.",
        "Alan: Is she all right?",
        "Beth: It's hormones. Okay, honey, what... what is it? What's the problem?",
        "Lizzie: Um... everything? Coop, Ava, Jonathan...",
        "Beth: Well, you can cross that one off your list.",
        "Lizzie: You took care of Jonathan?",
        "Beth: I did. I think you've seen the last of that little problem.",
        "Lizzie: Thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!",
        "Beth: No need to thank me, honey. Now, what's next on the agenda?",
        "Lizzie: Um... okay. Coop. He is... he's stalling about moving into the house, and every time that he looks at me, he can't hide the fact that he'd rather be somewhere else. Or with someone else.",
        "Beth: Ava.",
        "Lizzie: She is like a rash. She's like a rash that won't go away.",
        "Beth: Only because we haven't applied the right cure. Now, what about you? You're going for your sonogram this afternoon, aren't you?",
        "Alan: I think we should go with her.",
        "Beth: Shh.",
        "Lizzie: That is one good thing. Coop is going with me.",
        "Beth: Now, that is good. See, this afternoon you're going to find out the sex, and once that happens, it will be very real. There's no going back. He'll be all yours. And don't worry about Ava. I'm on it.",
        "Lizzie: Thank you! Thank you so much! ( Laughs )",
        "Beth: Call me after your doctor's appointment. And I love you, sweetie.",
        "Alan: Well, she's obviously all right.",

        "Olivia: Oh, no, no, I'm just going through Emma's old toys and clothes. I'm going to donate them.",
        "Frank: What's... what's Emma's take on this? I mean, Marina hated to give up her toys.",
        "Olivia: Well, she's on a play date. She doesn't know about it. I'm just a big chicken. No, I just need to make some room, you know? I need to purge and make space.",
        "Frank: Yeah. Well, you know, uh... you wouldn't have to make room if you had more room, right?",
        "Olivia: Well, I just have this one suite to myself. I still have a business to run.",
        "Frank: Oh, well, I was actually thinking more along the lines of... well, like getting a house. There's a nice big backyard and a basement.",
        "Olivia: Yeah. I mean, we don't have that now, but we will someday.",
        "Frank: You know, maybe you could have it now. Have you seen this?",
        "Olivia: Morningstar Estates... yes, I was working at Lewis when Josh was planning these. They are actually really beautiful. I don't know if it's the right neighborhood for me, though. You know, I kind of have this reputation, and I don't want Emma to suffer because we're not the typical two-family, two- kid, dog, cat, parakeet family.",
        "Frank: Well, then, maybe someone wouldn't mind living next to the Chief of Police. You know, I've always wanted to have a dog.",
        "Olivia: Are you moving there?",
        "Frank: Well, I need to... I mean, find two roommates. And I heard the schools are excellent.",
        "Olivia: Are... you asking me to...",
        "Frank: To live with me, you and Emma? Yes, I am.",

        "Reva: Well, that depends on when you ask me.",
        "Nurse: Chemo side-effects are no joke.",
        "Reva: Yeah, I know. I have my good days and I have my bad days. But... I'm lucky, because today is a good day. There's just no time to be sick today.",

        "Josh: Moving in or out?",
        "Jonathan: Moving on.",
        "Josh: Ah, yes.",
        "Jonathan: Yep. Things have gotten a little too complicated here.",
        "Josh: Really? How so?",
        "Jonathan: Well, with the charges against me and the fact that they're shutting down the bar and all that.",
        "Josh: Yeah. Are you sure that you and Tammy have enough money to... to move on somewhere else?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, we'll be okay.",
        "Josh: I guess you will. You want to tell me why Beth Spaulding is paying you to leave town?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: You're so gallant, Frank.",
        "Frank: No, I'm just a man who knows exactly what he wants, and I want you and I want Emma. So if you just say yes, I promise you, it would open up a whole new world for you. Olivia...",
        "Olivia: And what if I say no? It's just such a huge step.",
        "Frank: Yeah. Yeah, I know.",
        "Olivia: Listen, you misunderstand me. Look... I'm saying no to moving in, but I'm saying yes to... you know...",
        "Frank: You mean I'm going for the gold here and I'm going to end up with the silver?",
        "Olivia: Trust me, you'll feel like a winner in just a minute.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: This should cover it.",
        "Beth: I'll take care of this, Alan. My treat. You leave the tip. I'm going to pay at the counter. Oh, Ava! Don't you look your best today.",
        "Ava: Thanks.",
        "Beth: Have, uh... special plans?",
        "Ava: I'm not meeting up with Coop, if that's what you're getting at.",
        "Beth: Mm, yeah, I know that you and Coop are over. But you just look so nice, I just thought, you know, maybe you had a date or something.",
        "Ava: You know, you don't have to play me, Mrs. Spaulding.",
        "Beth: Okay. I admire the way you handled things with Henry. And I think it was very wise, especially considering that he and Lizzie are moving into the mansion with us. Have fun on your date. ( Whispers ): Looks cute.",
        "Jerry: For you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: ( Sighs ) Where have you been? Why did it take so long? ( Laughs )",
        "Coop: I had to work on the schedule. Somebody just called out sick at CO2, which means I have to now go down there and fill in for them.",
        "Lizzie: Today? What about the sonogram?",
        "Coop: I know, I know. Look, I'm going to have to call someone and see if I can get them to fill in for me. But in the meantime, I think that it's best if you just go down there and then I will get there as soon as I can. I am sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Ooh, smells like a bribe to me!",
        "Jonathan: How do you know that I didn't do a job for Beth?",
        "Josh: What, did you go to law school and not tell me about it?",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) The Spaulding's have a bad rep. They're actually very generous people.",
        "Josh: Yeah, especially when they want something. So they're buying you off to leave town. Why is that, Jonathan?",
        "Jonathan: They don't trust me. Now that little Lizzie's knocked up, they don't want me anywhere near her.",
        "Josh: What's Lizzie got to do with you?",
        "Jonathan: It's bad blood. It happens, you know. Lizzie's involved with the trial, with Ashlee, that whole stich. Bottom line: The Spaulding's want me gone, I'm going.",
        "Josh: You see, here's the thing, Jonathan. Spaulding money... comes with a price.",
        "Jonathan: Well, not to me. Money's money.",
        "Josh: So you're saying there's no strings attached here?",
        "Jonathan: There's nothing I can't handle.",
        "Josh: But the thing is, I can't let you be in debt to the Spaulding's.",
        "Jonathan: What?! Why not?",
        "Josh: Jonathan, the reason you and I started butting heads in the first place is because I didn't want you hurting the people I love-- Reva, Tammy, Cassie. And right now I'm standing up for you for the same reasons.",
        "Jonathan: What?",
        "Josh: If you and Tammy go running off, it's going to hurt the family, just at a time when we're getting it all back together again. So here's the deal. You're one of us now. We can't lose you again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I have a sonogram scheduled, but could we just hold off a couple of minutes until the father gets here?",
        "Nurse: I'll see, but we can't wait too long. We have other appointments.",
        "Lizzie: I know. I'm so sorry. I just really don't want the daddy to miss another chance at seeing the baby.",
        "Nurse: I understand. Why don't we just take you into an examination room and we'll make you as comfortable as possible.",

I think that our brother-brother relationship off-camera and on- camera really started practically from the first day that we started working together. Kim Zimmer is... she's just a force to be reckoned with. She's just, like, this crazy, wild ride, and you can either get on or she's just going to leave you behind.

        "Olivia: Yeah, that too.",
        "Frank: Well, let tell you something, young lady. I am... totally reliable. I'm a homebody. I'm really good at fixing things. I'm not such a good cook, but I've been known to...",
        "Olivia: Do you think we could just slow it down, just a little bit?",
        "Frank: I would really take care of you and Emma, I promise.",
        "Olivia: I know, and I appreciate the offer. I'm just not sure that I'm ready for such a big commitment, Frank.",
        "Frank: Whoa, boy, the \"C\" word. Most guys would be, like, running and screaming out the room right now, not the woman.",
        "Olivia: I'm not running. I'm not screaming. I'm right here.",
        "Frank: I see that.",
        "Olivia: This was amazing, Frank...",
        "Frank: Amazing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Ah, yes, just the person I was hoping to see.",
        "Alan: Oh, here we go. Well, what have I... done this time, Josh?",
        "Josh: You know, Alan, not everything is about you. Beth, you're more and more like him every day, right? How's that working out for you?",
        "Beth: You know, Josh, we were just here to get a little take- out, so... you know...",
        "Alan: Yes, what do you keep going on and on about here?",
        "Josh: Okay, let me just break it down for you, all right? Keep your filthy money and stay away from my family. No bribes, no extortion, no secret plans. Otherwise, Beth, the next time I see you... I won't be so nice.",
        "Beth: ( whispers ) Must be something in the water.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: I thought you were with Lizzie, getting the sonogram.",
        "Coop: I was. It's canceled. So... what's up?",
        "Ava: Oh, nothing. I'm just, you know, hanging out, getting something to eat.",
        "Jerry: Yeah, we'll take a couple of the chicken chipotle wraps and the mushroom soup. You going to write that down?",
        "Coop: It's not a very difficult order to remember. But the problem is, she doesn't like mushrooms.",
        "Jerry: Oh. All right, well, what about the french onion soup? I mean, that's from scratch, isn't it?",
        "Coop: It is, but we're out of onions.",
        "Jerry: Why don't we go someplace that actually has food?",
        "Coop: Corn chowder.",
        "Ava: Yeah, uh, sure.",
        "Coop: It's good.",
        "Ava: Yeah.",
        "Jerry: Great. Can we get our waters, too?",
        "Coop: Uh... yeah.",
        "Jerry: Let me guess: An ex.",
        "Ava: Sort of.",
        "Jerry: Well, you know what they say about exes, don't you?",
        "Ava: What?",
        "Jerry: Not much; that's why they call them exes.",
        "Coop: All right... is there anything else I can get for you?",
        "Ava: Can you excuse me for a second? Come here. Can I talk to you, please? What is the problem?",
        "Coop: The problem is you... living your life.",
        "Ava: You're supposed to be with Lizzie right now, holding her hand, looking at the baby that you put in her stomach. And you're here harassing me on my date?",
        "Coop: Yes. All right, I admit it. But you know what? I would be stupid not to.",
        "Ava: Did you ever think about how stupid it is that you're here bugging me?",
        "Coop: Yes, I did.",
        "Ava: Yeah? Why are you doing it, then?",
        "Coop: Ava, because I still have feelings for you. Now, I know that I don't have the right to tell you where you can go or who you can see. I know that.",
        "Ava: Just like you have the right to live with whoever you want, wherever you want.",
        "Coop: I was... going to tell you about moving in with Lizzie...",
        "Ava: Yeah, when were you going to tell me? When I got the invite to the housewarming party?",
        "Coop: Ava, please, come on now...",
        "Ava: So what if I've been spending all this time painting the nursery for you? Okay? So what if I've been bending over backwards trying to be understanding?",
        "Coop: And I know you have. I know.",
        "Ava: Okay, you know what, it's like... I know... and I like the fact that you're a nice guy, I do. But you need to start taking responsibility for the way it affects other people. It's crazy to think that we can be friends. I mean, this is...",
        "Coop: No, it's not, Ava, please...",
        "Ava: Okay, I don't want any more of your nice guy stuff, okay? Your life belongs with Lizzie and the baby. Stop splitting yourself in half. I just... I'm going to make this easy for you, okay? I don't want you in my life anymore. Am I clear? Do you understand me? Whatever it is that's going on with us, whatever's been happening, Coop, I'm sorry, okay? But I can't do it anymore. Um... maybe we can do this another time, Jerry.",
        "Jerry: What did he say?",
        "Ava: There was nothing that he could say. Look, I have to go. Sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Josh, what are you talking about?",
        "Josh: I'm sorry. Was it not your wife's signature on the check that she gave to Jonathan?",
        "Alan: Well, I'm sure you just misunderstood Beth's intention, that's all.",
        "Josh: I don't think so. Your intention was to get Jonathan to leave town, right? To ship him out sort of parcel post? Give him a bunch of money just like Alan would? But you know what? My family... my family, they ain't bitin'.",
        "Alan: Since when is that mutt part of your family, Josh? You've never liked him.",
        "Beth: Yeah, Alan has a point. You put him in the hospital. Didn't you throw him down a flight of stairs at Towers?",
        "Josh: This is not about me, Beth. This is about you. You want Jonathan to stay away from Lizzie and Coop, is that right?",
        "Beth: Can you blame me?",
        "Josh: Well, there's a problem, see. Jonathan is Reva's son. So he's not going to leave town. So I would suggest this-- you want Lizzie to stay away from Jonathan? Send her out of town, maybe to a convent. Or lock her up in that butt-ugly house of yours! Have a good day.",
        "Beth: Macho blowhard!",
        "Alan: Beth, would you mind shedding a little light on what that \"Macho blowhard\" is talking about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse: I'm ready when you are.",
        "Lizzie: We can't wait a little bit longer?",
        "Nurse: We should get started. I have an appointment after you. Would you lift your shirt, please?",
        "Lizzie: Well, maybe he'll get here before you're finished. I just really wanted the father to be here. Coop?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Okay, fine. I did bribe Jonathan to get him to leave town.",
        "Alan: Didn't seem to work very well, did it? My question to you, Beth, is why?",
        "Beth: Because he was being a nuisance to Lizzie. And don't give me any flack about it. You've bribed so many people, you can't even keep track.",
        "Alan: Look, I don't dispute your right to do whatever you think is necessary for your daughter. But my question to you is, why didn't you tell me about it?",
        "Beth: Well, because I wanted to, uh... to handle it on my own, Alan, you know, I wanted to flex some muscle.",
        "Alan: A little advice: Once you bribe someone, it's best that they stay bribed. You still have a few things to learn. I take ice.",

        "Buzz: Whose idea was it to run two places? Right, mine.",

        "Buzz: Mm-mm. Not here.",
        "Olivia: Great. ( Sighs )",
        "Buzz: Never respond to a woman's sigh.",
        "Olivia: A thigh?",
        "Buzz: No, sigh.",
        "Olivia: Oh.",
        "Buzz: No, never mind. ( Laughs )",
        "Olivia: I... I think I blew it. I... Frank asked me to move in with him.",
        "Buzz: And you said...?",
        "Olivia: I blew it.",
        "Buzz: No, I can't get involved in this, I really can't. No, you... ( laughs )",
        "Olivia: No, I'm not, I understand...",
        "Buzz: I'm already involved in this, I'm already involved, you know? I asked, you sighed, I asked again, you responded... I don't... I can't be involved in this.",
        "Olivia: I understand, I really... God, what's wrong with me?",
        "Buzz: Was that rhetorical or...?",
        "Olivia: Frank is such a nice guy. I mean, he's the first guy I've been with that I really believe would never hurt me. I just need more time.",
        "Buzz: If you need more time, you need more time, you know? Your problem is, you always think you're running out of time, but you're not. You have all the time in the world because you hold all the cards. So you've got time, you've just got to believe that.",
        "Olivia: Thanks. Thanks for getting me.",
        "Buzz: Ain't all that hard.",

        "Ava: Hi, jerry, it's Ava. I... I just wanted to call and apologize about the date. I don't blame you if you don't want to ever talk to me again. I'm just really sorry. I just wanted to apologize. Bye. ( Knock at door )",
        "Ava: Oh, of course it's you. What part of \"Stay out of my life\" don't you understand?",
        "Coop: All of it.",
        "Ava: Good-bye, Coop.",
        "Coop: No, Ava, wait, look, I can't let you walk out of my life, not this time.",
