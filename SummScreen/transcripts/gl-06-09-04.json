        "There were a few touchy moments where it looked as though Salerno wouldn't go through with the plan but Danny brought him around and got the deal back on again. That took most of the episode actually. Lizzy thought Joey would ask her to the Spring Fling but instead, he asked her to go with one of his friends. She declined. Gus got into place in the wine cellar so he could witness the buy and found Alan waiting instead. Phillip insisted Olivia wear the red dress that he got for her that didn't leave much to the imagination."

        "Alan: Well, tonight will be a welcome change. Past few months people have been starring at us wondering if we're going to be the next corporate casualty.",
        "Phillip: Although, would have been nice if they had found just enough incriminating to lock Olivia out for a couple years.",
        "Alan: There's more than one way to skin a cat.",
        "Phillip: It's amazing she was able to come through that investigation when her image intact, though.",
        "Alan: Well, she convinced everyone that she was the stabilizing force in the company, when in truth she was trying to undermine us.",
        "Phillip: Well, it's all about perception. But you know, perception can change overnight, all it takes is a few bad decisions.",
        "Alan: What have you got up your sleeve?",
        "Phillip: I'm just having a little fun. Although by the end of the evening you never know, there may be a little tarnish on Olivia's reputation.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Isn't this fun? It's like playing dress-up.",
        "Olivia: It is, thanks for letting me do this, and I really needed to see a friendly face tonight. So this is a big night for Edmund, huh?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, it's huge.",
        "Olivia: Do have an eye lash roller?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, it's on the back of the top shelf. I'm going to have to go in a few minute to run and check on the boys. Then I'm going to have to call around and see how Edmund is doing, you know, he's been acting a little crazy, checking every detail, he certainly doesn't want anything to go wrong.",
        "Olivia: What could go wrong, is only a party, right?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, but it's his first big thing since he became ambassador to San Cristobel.",
        "Olivia: Well, then you're really not going to like what I have to say.",
        "Cassie: Great. What is it?",
        "Olivia: Phillip and I aren't staying at the party tonight.",
        "Cassie: What? You have to. I mean come on, you guys, well, you are San Cristobel, you are, you are a part of it. We need you.",
        "Olivia: Look, you're going to be fine, it's just that Phillip feels like it's too big of an event, too many people, too much stress, we're going to say our hellos and then go have dinner at towers.",
        "Cassie: All right, I guess you have to do what you have to do. I'll be back; I'm going to go run and check up on the boys.",
        "Olivia: Wait, don't go, I need to you tell me how to strap this, okay, and really, thank you for letting me change here because I didn't want to go home.",
        "Cassie: Oh, you look so beautiful! And elegant. It's amazing.",
        "Olivia: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: Wait, video view of you hanging those banners, that's the perfect digital journal, seriously, that way when your grandpa checks the website he's going to see all the hard work we've been doing.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. So what do you think?",
        "Joey: A little bit higher on the right.",
        "Lizzie: All right, you're going to have to hold onto me, because I can't do this myself. All right.",
        "Joey: I got you, I got you, and I got you.",
        "Lizzie: Okay.",
        "Joey: Looks good to me.",
        "Lizzie: I think it may need to come up a little bit just on the right side. Oh my gosh!",
        "Joey: Now I've really got you.",
        "Lizzie: I'm sorry.",
        "Joey: It's a good thing I was here.",
        "Lizzie: I know, and you're so strong.",
        "Joey: Yeah.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I'm fine.",
        "Joey: Right. So, it looks pretty straight to me.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. You're right, it looks great, perfect.",
        "Joey: You know, I really hope our team wins the ticket in the contest; I want to be relaxing enjoying the party instead of working all night.",
        "Lizzie: I'm sure we'll win.",
        "Joey: Yeah. I wish Tammy was here.",
        "Lizzie: You won't get to see her the whole night?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tony: Will you stop pacing, Danny? If Vinnie sees you this nervous he's going to know something's up.",
        "Danny: If Michelle wakes up before at the tell Salerno he's going to go after her.",
        "Tony: Stop it, stop it, everything is go to go according to plan. Look, Reva already convinced Vinnie he needs to stay put. And I'm going to make sure he's here when the feds come to bust him. You're going to make the switch for the money, for the antimonious. O'Neill will have what he needs, it's good, and you'll be underneath that idiot's thumb, Danny. (Phone rings)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. Tell your cousin I heard that.",
        "Danny: I hope you all heard that, you need to rewire this place.",
        "Jeffrey: Speaking of wires, you got yours?",
        "Danny: Yeah, I'll put it on before I go to the beacon to make the switch.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, good. And I want to you stay put, we're going to run this whole thing down one more time. Let's see if these things work. Harley, can you hear me?",
        "Harley: Roger.",
        "Jeffrey: Gus?",
        "Gus: Roger.",
        "Jeffrey: Gus?",
        "Gus: Roger! That one, boss.",
        "Jeffrey: That's funny, but it's not really time for fun and games right now.",
        "Gus: This whole thing is pretty funny to me if you want to know the truth.",
        "Jeffrey: Just please try to stay focused.",
        "Gus: Hey, if anything goes wrong tonight, O'Neill, it isn't going to be Cooper and it isn't going to be me, okay?",
        "Jeffrey: What if it's Alan, Gus? What if the Spaulding connection is your father, are you going to be able to slap the cuffs on your own father tonight?",
        "Gus: How many times do we have to have this conversation? I'm a professional; I do what I have to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Not bad, Olivia, not bad at all. (Knocking) Phillip! I thought we agreed we were going to meet downstairs.",
        "Phillip: A change of plans, brought you something.",
        "Olivia: It looks like a dress.",
        "Paul: It is a dress.",
        "Olivia: For tonight?",
        "Phillip: Uh-huh. Can't wait to see you in it.",
        "Olivia: You're going to have to because I have a dress, it's new and it's just for tonight.",
        "Phillip: Lovely, you look great in it. But this, this will be spectacular on you.",
        "Olivia: Look, we're not even staying for the party, why don't we save that dress for another bigger event.",
        "Phillip: We're a married couple with a child, every night out is a big event. You know, this dress makes a statement; it lets everybody know exactly what you're all about. Wear this; people will be talking about you all night.",
        "Lizzie: But we'll still be able to have fun even though Tammy is not here, right?",
        "Joey: I guess. But...",
        "Lizzie: Look, we worked hard for it and we deserve it, we make a great team, Joey.",
        "Tammy: No kidding. What would you do without my boyfriend, Lizzie? He helps you hang banners, catches you when you fall.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, you saw that.",
        "Tammy: I saw it.",
        "Lizzie: I'm such a klutz, what can I say?",
        "Tammy: Among other things.",
        "Joey: Yeah, check out the time. We probably should go up and get changed; I don't think your grandfather wants his Spaulding interns running around in blue jeans tonight, does he.",
        "Lizzie: I took a room here just to get ready; you're more than welcome to use it.",
        "Tammy: Oh, that's generous of you, Lizzie, but I already live here, remember, so Joey already has a place to get changed.",
        "Joey: Right.",
        "Lizzie: That's true, what was I thinking?",
        "Tammy: I know what you were thinking.",
        "Joey: Come on, guys, let's get this show on the road.",
        "Lizzie: Now you sound like sandy. I can't believe you brought that camera in here.",
        "Shayne: Believe it, nobody's safe. That's part of the project, remember? Come on, Lupo, look alive, Juliette, come on.",
        "Lizzie: You guys, Joey and I are working in here.",
        "Tammy: One of you is working all right.",
        "Shayne: Guys this is a video, come on.",
        "Lizzie: Enough of me.",
        "Joey: It's never enough of you.",
        "Lizzie: Oh stop.",
        "Joey: All right. Group shot, everybody. Group shot. Here we are, ladies and gentlemen, here is the future of Spaulding Enterprises. Lupo, get in there man, you are part of this. Come on.",
        "Lizzie: Right here, Joey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I can feel it. This is going to be the best party.",
        "Edmund: I take it you're not in the middle of being overwhelmed by fond memories.",
        "Sandy: San Cristobel can sink into the sea.",
        "Edmund: I didn't have an idyllic childhood there, either, despite appearances. And for many years I used that as an excuse for everything that went wrong in my life, for all of my bad choices. You are just one of the many people adversely affected by my bad choices, but Sandy, the key is that we all do have choices. If we have choices, we can change. We can be happy.",
        "Harley: You know, when this project wraps up, I think you and I should take off to an island for a couple weeks.",
        "Gus: That would be amazing. Here you go.",
        "Harley: Thanks.",
        "Gus: I better go down to the wine cellar.",
        "Harley: So early?",
        "Gus: I'm a little antsy; I want to make sure everything is ready to go.",
        "Harley: Okay. Just check your ear piece and your microphone, okay him and remember that I love you.",
        "Gus: Yes, I love you, too. You're the second person that's said that to me.",
        "Harley: Yeah. What brought that with about?",
        "Gus: It was out of the blue. Came complete with a hug.",
        "Harley: You okay?",
        "Gus: I'm fine. Wine cellar."
