        "Dinah: I'm going to be there. Me, too.",
        "Mallet: So do we rest up for the honeymoon, or do we keep practicing?",
        "Dinah: Well, you know what they say, \"Practice makes perfect.\" Good night!",
        "Mallet: ( Laughs ) You know what, though? Before we walk down the aisle, we better figure out what's up with those notes. I don't want somebody with a grudge to ruin your wedding.",
        "Dinah: My wedding?",
        "Mallet: Well, our wedding.",
        "Dinah: Look, honey, I don't know. I mean, who's to say those notes are just for me? I'm not so sure that you're not the one being threatened here.",

        "Gus: Any questions with the house, that goes to my wife, and she's not around. Yeah. Well, I don't know that, either, 'cause if I knew where she was, I'd just put you on the phone with her. That's her department. I can't... look, I can't help you, but we'll handle this, all right? I don't know where she is, so... all right, bye. I don't know where she is because I'm only the husband. Why should I know where she is? Although, I've never been married before, so maybe this is the way marriage works. Oh, hello.",
        "Buzz: How many of you are there?",
        "Gus: Yeah, you're a funny guy. You've always been funny. But a funny guy is not really what I need right now. It's not going to help me find what I'm looking for, so take it easy.",
        "Buzz: You looking for my daughter?",
        "Gus: Yes, also known as my wife.",
        "Buzz: Well, stick around. Maybe I can help.",

        "Colin: Do I know you?",

        "Tammy: A friend of mine is having a pregnancy sonogram, and I wanted to go see her, but I just didn't know where or what floor, but...",
        "Colin: Sonogram. Oh...",
        "Tammy: I shouldn't have bothered you. It's okay. I'll ask at the desk.",

        "Coop: We aren't finished.",
        "Ava: Oh, yes we are, whether you like it or not, and I don't. We were finished the day you got Lizzie pregnant, which is why I was out on a date-- a date that you ruined.",
        "Coop: No, Ava...",
        "Ava: Thank you very much.",
        "Coop: ...That guy wasn't even right for you, all right? I thought that maybe I could... but I changed my mind.",
        "Ava: Really? Okay, great. Why don't you tell me who you think my boyfriend should be, Coop? Huh? Go ahead.",

        "Gus: Buzz, that's what I do. That's all I do is make her safe.",
        "Buzz: I know, you're well- intentioned, but you've made some questionable choices. How's she going to trust you when you go out and do some of the crazy things you do?",
        "Gus: Well, that's a good point.",
        "Buzz: The mistakes she makes is because she wanted to feel safe, like she was in a safe place. Maybe that's why she married Phillip. Who knows?",
        "Gus: Yeah. Maybe that's why she's had three different kids with three different men.",
        "Buzz: If you're high, you're not safe, and you never will be.",
        "Gus: Buzz, I got a problem, okay. I don't need you to come over here and whisper it in my ear. I know I have a problem. And I thought that I could deal with it. It's just a little more difficult than I... than I thought. I don't... I don't know how this happened to me.",
        "Buzz: It happens, so fix it. Clean yourself up. Make yourself a safe place for her. Believe it or not, we miss you. I miss you. Fix it, or I'll sic Frank on you.",

        "Ava: What? You're not sorry that you looked at me?",
        "Coop: No. Ava, I couldn't help what I said, and I certainly couldn't help what I saw or what I did. When I saw you with that cop, I hated him.",
        "Ava: You hated... why would you hate him?",
        "Coop: Because he was with you, and I wasn't. Ava, I want you so much. It's consuming me. You are... all-consuming, and I don't know what to do about what I'm feeling for you inside right now. I don't...",
        "Ava: Please, okay, Coop, don't make me do something we can't do, okay, because we can't do this.",

        "Jonathan: There she is.",

        "Lizzie: Yes.",
        "Jonathan: Is he going to take care of that kid?",
        "Lizzie: Yes. Coop is the real deal. He's... he's the kind of guy that any kid would be lucky to have as a father. This is going to work if you'll just let it. Please. Give this little girl every chance that she deserves. Give her a chance to be happy.",

        "Jonathan: Yeah. It's a girl.",
        "Reva: You gonna name her after me?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Do you see my name anywhere on these notes? I don't.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, but one of the notes was attached to your dry cleaning. And if someone was looking to threaten me, wouldn't they attach it to my dry cleaning?",
        "Dinah: Well, I don't know. I mean, somebody trying to get a note into a room we both occupy, I don't know if they'd be all that particular.",
        "Mallet: Hmm. Well, that's a pretty good point.",
        "Dinah: I'm just saying I have every right to worry about you as much as you worry about me-- that is, if we want to stay alive long enough to, you know, walk down the aisle, exchange vows, exchange rings. You do want to shove the whole wedding cake in my face, don't you?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I can't wait.",
        "Dinah: Even if it means you have to marry me?",
        "Mallet: Yeah. I did ask, right?",
        "Dinah: Yes, and I did say yes, so...",
        "Mallet: Yes, you did say yes. It took you a while, but yes, you did.",
        "Dinah: Yeah.",
        "Mallet: So I guess we're... ( cell phone rings ) ...guess we're getting married.",
        "Dinah: Okay, hold that thought. Hold that thought. It's Harley. Hey! Hi.",
        "Mallet: I'm going to take off.",
        "Dinah: Just hold on. What's going on. How are you? Sure. Yeah, he's here. One second. She wants to talk to you.",
        "Mallet: Hey. Good, good, you? Yeah. Yeah, I know you are. Yeah, I saw him the other day. No, no, because I don't think I'm the best choice for keeping an eye on Gus. Because I'm way down on his list. And all he has to do is look at me and it just sets him off. Well, I know that, but... ( knock on the door )",
        "Gus: Surprise.",
        "Dinah: Hello.",
        "Gus: This a bad time?",
        "Dinah: Yeah.",
        "Gus: That's too bad. Let me ask you something: Do you know where my wife is? 'Cause if she'd talk to anybody, she'd talk to you.",
        "Dinah: Hey, Gus, even if I did know where Harley was, I don't think I should be getting in the middle of anything.",
        "Gus: I'm not trying to do that. I'm not doing anything. It's just we have a contractor and we have a house, and he's trying to work on the house and he wants answers, and she wants things a certain way, and I don't know what to tell the guy. I don't know what to say to him. I'm stuck in the middle. I'm the guy holding the bag here.",
        "Dinah: Okay, okay. Listen, honey, I don't know. I don't know what makes you think I was talking to Harley.",
        "Gus: Because if there was anybody, it would be you, right, that she would be in touch with.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, that sounds good. I'll talk to you later, Harley. All right. Okay, bye. Hey, man, how's it going?",
        "Gus: Give me that phone. Restricted number. That's convenient.",
        "Dinah: Gus, listen, okay...",
        "Gus: No. You, what is the matter with you? Do you live under a rock or something?",
        "Dinah: No. I just don't want to get into this right now.",
        "Gus: He was talking to my... he just talking to my wife! I have a right...",
        "Mallet: Harley was talking to me about helping you.",
        "Gus: I don't need any help from anybody.",
        "Mallet: Isn't it nice and convenient having me around to blame for everything?",
        "Gus: You know what you should do? You should get on a plane, go to Europe and find my wife. And then you should hold her hand and you should be there for her and comfort her, just like you were in the past.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, okay. That's it. We're through.",
        "Gus: Well, I'm not through. I'm not done talking to you.",
        "Mallet: I am, I am. I'm through here, man. It's time for you to stop blaming the rest of the world for all your problems, okay? I'm tired of pulling punches, man. You know what? Get a grip.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colin: We should go to my office.",
        "Reva: I'll bet you're not a very good poker player, are you? So, how long do I have? I mean, you can spit it out because I want to know the truth. You can tell me.",
        "Colin: If we could just talk about this back in...",
        "Reva: No, we're not going to talk about this in your office. We're going to talk about it now. Hi, sweetie.",
        "Tammy: Aunt Reva!",
        "Reva: How are you, honey?",
        "Colin: Aunt Reva?",
        "Tammy: Oh, hello, Doctor. Would you believe, even after you gave me directions, I still managed to get lost somehow? So how do you know my Aunt Reva?",
        "Reva: Well, we don't really know each other...",
        "Colin: Well... no, well, we do, actually. And, if you'll forgive us, we're about to... about to leave.",
        "Reva: No, that... you know, that actually was before I realized that I got my sweet little niece right here with me, and I've got something important I need to talk to you about.",
        "Colin: Mrs. Lewis?",
        "Reva: No. I mean, I can catch up with you. I'll... I'll track you down. It'll only take a minute. We have all the time in the world to talk about Josh's project.",
        "Colin: Come and find me when you're done. Miss...",
        "Tammy: Winslow.",
        "Colin: Miss Winslow, Cassie's daughter?",
        "Tammy: You know my mom?",
        "Colin: Yeah. I... I should be going.",
        "Reva: Wow! What can I do for you?",
        "Tammy: I'm trying to find Lizzie. I know she's around somewhere.",
        "Reva: Lizzie? She's having a sonogram right in that room.",
        "Tammy: Oh. So you know about Lizzie's baby, the pregnancy and everything?",
        "Reva: Yeah. Yeah, as a matter of fact, I do. You know, sweetie, I'm... I'm very concerned about you and Jonathan.",
        "Tammy: Concerned? About what?",
        "Reva: About how much things are going to be changing for... for both of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: No more talking, okay? Not tonight. Just take it off.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, what the hell, man! What the hell are you doing, man? You don't deserve to be a father. You do not deserve that kid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Robert Newman, \"Inside The Light.\" Josh and... Josh and Dinah were locked in an elevator together for a few hours, I think it would be really interesting-- or maybe just, like, ten minutes. That would probably be plenty for Josh, the umpteenth time that he brought Reva back to life, you know? I mean, I've... I think I've saved about a dozen people's lives on this show. I think he's a man that cares deeply about his friends and his family and will do anything for them, including risk his own life. See Josh, Wednesday, June 14, \"Inside The Light.\"",

        "Gus: I'm wasting my time.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, you are, 'cause you're a busy guy digging that hole for yourself. But you keep going. You're almost near the bottom. You keep digging.",
        "Dinah: Mallet, come on.",
        "Mallet: Poor Gus, he got a raw deal, man. Your wife thought you were dead; she made a bad call. But you're right, I'm over it, too. I'm through, so why don't you just get out? And if you run into the old Gus, you let him know that my door is always open. But pill-popping cops? That's a whole other matter. Remind me to call Harley back and let her know that Gus is kind of a lost cause.",
        "Gus: You're an idiot, a self- righteous idiot, and you're going to pay for this. Trust me. And you, why don't you wake up, get smart, and get away from this clown while you still can?",
        "Dinah: He's a mess. I can't believe he just threatened you.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, baby, you can't believe it, but I can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: What the hell is your problem, Jonathan?",
        "Jonathan: What the hell are you doing? You get some girl pregnant, you turn around two seconds later, you're hooking up with another one.",
        "Coop: Hey, listen, man, my relationship with Ava is none of your business.",
        "Jonathan: No, you listen, man. You got other business to think about, you got it? Coopers are supposed to be so damn decent, like everybody says. Turns out you're worse than me.",
        "Ava: Stop it!",
        "Coop: Get out of here, Jonathan! Get out!",
        "Jonathan: You're going to do the right thing by Lizzie, you understand? You're going to be a good father to that kid, or I'm...",
        "Coop: Or what? Or what? Huh? Or what? What happens, Jonathan, if I don't measure up to your little standards you got set for me, huh? Better yet, why don't you just show me? What are you going to do, huh? Come on, Jonny.",

        "Tammy: Aunt Reva, I haven't said anything to my mom about moving away, so please don't tell her. Just let us do it, okay? I mean, you're right, it... it's going to be a big change.",
        "Reva: Tammy, leaving town now...",
        "Tammy: It's exciting, it's exciting, I know. And I really think it's time, too, you know. Seeing new places and meeting new people, it's going to be great. The best part is just knowing that we've come to this whole new place in our relationship, you know. Jonathan thinks so, too. All the bad stuff is finally behind us.",
        "Reva: I want you to be happy, I do-- both of you.",
        "Tammy: I know.",
        "Reva: But, you know, life isn't perfect. There's... there's always problems.",
        "Tammy: Well, sure. We'll handle them together.",
        "Reva: Just remember that.",
        "Tammy: It's simple. Loving Jonathan is as simple as breathing; it's living with Jonathan.",

        "Lizzie: Oh, yeah! This is... this is the perfect time. Let's go across the street and get a table.",
        "Tammy: Perfect. Oh, wait. First, was there something else you were going to say to me?",
        "Reva: No, no, honey. I'm... I'm all done.",
        "Tammy: Okay. Well, it's really great just running into you like this.",

        "Reva: Not now.",
        "Colin: No, I'm sorry, you've got to listen to me. The blood test you took?",
        "Reva: Yeah, what about it?",
        "Colin: Your white cell count is through the roof. God, it's strange...",
        "Reva: Which means? ...Life will change...",
        "Colin: Reva, your cancer is spreading. ...Ooh, in a moment.",
        "Reva: My cancer is spreading?",
        "Colin: White cell count usually indicates the cancerous cells are spreading through the bloodstream. I'm sorry.",
        "Reva: Thanks.",
        "Colin: I had hoped, before I saw your test results... I had... I had... I had hoped for something else.",
        "Reva: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Colin: Of course, this means we'll have to make adjustments now to your chemotherapy. There'll be more side effects, more pronounced.",
        "Reva: Yeah, because they were so pleasant before.",
        "Colin: We'll have to consider some surgical options, as well.",
        "Reva: You know what? Take the detachment and your Chicken Little routine and tell someone else the sky is falling, because I'll tell you something, Doc. I have family and I have friends, and I have people who need me, and I'm not going to let them down, damn it. I also have a granddaughter on the way, and there's no chance in hell I'm not going to be here to spoil her. So you just go, Doctor Doom, you just go and you find someone else who needs you, someone who's really sick.",
        "Colin: Reva...",
        "Reva: Because it's not me. That person is not me. It's not me.",
        "Colin: Reva, we're going to need to discuss the next course of action. Call me... call me any time if you have any questions, or if you need to talk about anything.",

        "Jonathan: Look at us here going at it, her singing backup, me playing good guy speaking the truth, saying, \"Do the right thing,\" and you being so selfish you put little Mr. Willie above the baby.",
        "Coop: You know what? You've got about three seconds to get the hell out of here before we call security to make sure I don't do something that I'm going to regret.",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) Okay! Listen, then, just try and forget who the messenger is and listen to the message. You'll see it's the right thing. Not that you're going to do that with Victoria whispering secrets in your ear.",
        "Ava: Why don't you get out of here, Jonathan?",
        "Jonathan: Hey, hey, I'm already gone, kids. Just remember, Coop, do the world a favor: If you're going to stick around this time, use a condom. One little Coop-a-doop running around this town, more than enough.",

        "Ava: No, Coop, don't, okay? Please.",
        "Coop: Look, I know that I...",

        "Tammy: Is something wrong?",
        "Lizzie: I just think maybe we could talk about it later. Coop never showed up for the sonogram. I'm getting kind of worried.",
        "Tammy: Well, I'm sure there's a good reason why he didn't show up.",
        "Lizzie: Right.",

        "Lizzie: Really? Flowers?",
        "Tammy: Trust me. If it was me having that sonogram, Jonathan would have been glued to that screen. Most people probably won't believe it about him, but he'd be so blown away at the thought that he helped to create a life. There's no place he would rather be than there.",
        "Lizzie: If you say so.",

        "Reva: Nothing.",
        "Jonathan: Nothing? Yeah, right. Tell that to the look on your face. Come on, something's up. What, did you just see a ghost?",

        "Reva: It's your baby, too, and no tricks. Just logic, okay. Just the truth.",

        "Mallet: It was your idea in the first place. I mean, you were the one that came up with the idea I could be the target. And really, it's not that big of an idea, really. It's not that big of a leap to think that Gus could have sent these.",
        "Dinah: He's your partner.",
        "Mallet: He's not my partner anymore. You know what he is? He's a junky. He's a junky. He sneaks around paranoid. His eyes are hollow. It's like he's numb from the neck up. And he's blaming me... he's blaming me for all of this problems.",

        "Mallet: Hey, hey, hey, where are you going?",
        "Dinah: Well, I am going to go find Gus-- number one, to prove you wrong; and number two, you saw him; he looks terrible. He shouldn't be driving that way.",
