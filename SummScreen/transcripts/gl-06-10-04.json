        "Danny: All right, I'll make the switch. I'll meet you back here with the goods. You're making the right decision, Vinnie.",
        "Salerno: Oh, I know I am.",
        "Danny: All right. Yeah, it's me. We're all set. Salerno called the supplier. The deals back on. Yeah, I'm on my way.",
        "Tony: So we're good?",
        "Danny: Yeah, I'm going to make the drop at the beacon. And also the bus is going to be here at midnight. Which means you've got to keep him in here.",
        "Tony: Don't worry about it. I've got it covered. I'm the one who set tonight's card game up. So it's good, all right?",
        "Danny: You think that's enough to keep him here?",
        "Tony: Now listen. Vinnie never has been one to pass up a good hand of poker. So it's good.",
        "Danny: Okay.",
        "Salerno: Well, boys, I'm leaving town.",
        "Lizzie: Can you believe her?",
        "Joey: Yeah... wow.",
        "Lizzie: The only reason why she's parading around half naked is because she gets hot flashes.",
        "Joey: Where are you going?",
        "Lizzie: Someone has to hose her down.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, it's that pizza joint off of fifth. Cinelli'S. Good. Take care of it. Thanks. What's going on with you?",
        "Cassie: I lost Edmund.",
        "Jeffrey: What?",
        "Cassie: Well, everything was going fine, but he disappeared again.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm sure he's'\u0097",
        "Tony: You can't go, vinnie, all right. You can't.",
        "Salerno: No, I don't answer to you, Antonio, all right. The deal is back on. Which means I'm leaving. That's how I operate.",
        "Danny: Vinnie, I thought we agreed that we'd meet here.",
        "Salerno: I changed my mind, Danny, all right? What you said before--",
        "Tony: Of course, it's always what Danny says. See it's always you listening to what Danny has to say, right?",
        "Salerno: You've got a problem, Tony?",
        "Tony: Yeah, I got a problem, okay.",
        "Salerno: What are you talking about?",
        "Tony: I want the job. I want the drug job. I want to be the bag man.",
        "Salerno: Hey, hey, hey. Keep it down, huh? You don't know who's out here.",
        "Joey: Yeah. (Laughs)",
        "Tammy: I wish we were on the same team. Now I have to go in and work this thing.",
        "Joey: No, you don't have to go in yet.",
        "Tammy: I wish I could spend the whole night out here with you. At least we have the big dance. You know, last year I almost didn't go to the prom because I didn't have a date. But then I went and I met you and that changed everything.",
        "Joey: No kidding. Last year, I was on a field in a catchers mask and this year I was up on stage in tights.",
        "Tammy: (Laughs) well, not everything's changed, you know. Last year my mom hated you and this year my mom hates you.",
        "Joey: All right.",
        "Tammy: I'm just kidding. Mom and Uncle Edmund are really overprotective, but they both really like you a lot.",
        "Joey: Well, I'm just glad you worked everything out with them. I mean things were pretty tense for awhile.",
        "Tammy: Yeah. Now we're just one big happy family.",
        "Harley: Oh, wow.",
        "Buzz: Oh, I'll second that.",
        "Harley: Yeah, I just can't believe Olivia's wearing that dress.",
        "Alexandra: Well, actually it's not really a dress. It's looks more like a tacky tutu.",
        "Harley: (Laughs) that dress sure is distracting.",
        "Buzz: These Spaulding family events are always a good time.",
        "Alexandra: Yeah, speaking of family, I haven't seen Phillip near Olivia since they paraded in their grand entrance. I wonder where he could be hiding?",
        "Buzz: Nice party, princess.",
        "Cassie: Hey, you're suppose to bow when you say that. (Laughter)",
        "Buzz: Where's Edmund? I wanted to congratulate him. It's hard to pull something like this off.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, well, you should tell him that when you find him, because I have no idea where he is.",
        "Marina: Hey, did you hear? We won the ticket challenge?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, that's because I'm on the team.",
        "Tammy: I know you hate these formal things. Thanks again for asking me to the summer fling.",
        "Joey: Well, who else was I going to ask?",
        "Lizzie: Hey, did you hear? We won the big ticket challenge.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, Lizzie, we heard.",
        "Lizzie: Well, come on. Let's go. Our team got to celebrate. Come on.",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Salerno: We had this settled the other day, right? You were standing right there when I gave Danny the job.",
        "Tony: Vinnie, you know what? I didn't like it then and I don't like it now, okay. You didn't just give him the job, Vinnie. You gave him the hit on O'Neill too. Now how well did that go? You want to risk the fact that he's going to have screw up that up again?",
        "Danny: Shut up, Tony.",
        "Tony: You better watch who you're talking to, Danny. I got more seniority than you do.",
        "Danny: Oh, like that means anything. Give me a break. Vinnie didn't give you the drug job because he thinks you can't handle it. It takes a little more than muscle. You've got to have some brains, some know-how, some finesse.",
        "Tony: Oh, finesse, right?",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Tony: Really? Did you finesse the job at the warehouse when you blew your wife up?",
        "Salerno: Hey, that's enough, all right? I'm not going to stand here and listen to you two, all right? I put up with it the other day. I'm not going to do it now. You think I'm going to hang around here and settle this score for you, huh? Nice try, boys, but I can see right through you.",
        "Salerno: Look, I'm not buying this little fight, all right? It wasn't about the job before, and it's not about the job now. It's about two cousins with a lot of bad blood between them. But you've going to have to get over it, because I've got a business to... that's Cinnelli'S.",
        "Reporter: Late breaking news. A car lost control just off Fifth Street. It crashed through the plate glass window of Cinnelli's pizza. Amazingly, there were no injuries. Police suspect the driver...",
        "Salerno: That's the pizza place your friend Reva told me to stay away from.",
        "Tony: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.",
        "Salerno: Remember? And she said I shouldn't go anywhere.",
        "Danny: So what does that mean, you're not leaving town now?",
        "Salerno: No. No, no, no. I've got to stay here and watch this report. So take this fight or whatever it is outside, all right? And Danny, don't come back until you get the job done.",
        "Reporter: ...Bring you details as we have them.",
        "Danny: Yeah, sure, vinnie.",
        "Tony: So Reva did well, right?",
        "Danny: Well, he's staying in town. That's what matters.",
        "Tony: I'll tell you, for a minute there, I thought he was onto us, that's for sure.",
        "Danny: Me, too.",
        "Gus: I was just doing the same thing you were doing. Just checking out the wine.",
        "Alan: No, I just asked you that, and you said that you were down here...",
        "Gus: No, no. You asked me if I was getting wine. I'm not getting wine. So I said no. I'm just checking it out, though, because now... recently I've been kind of interested in wine. I've got the whole wine appreciation thing going on. It's the rage. I think it's been since I've been hanging out at the Spaulding Mansion, you know?",
        "Alan: Really?",
        "Gus: Mm-hmm.",
        "Alan: Well, Gus, if you're interested in wine, I can really help you out there. As a matter of fact, I've got a very good wine I'm taking upstairs. Look, when you're at the house next time, why don't I take you to my cellar, and we'll...",
        "Gus: Sure.",
        "Alan: Wait. Were you not going to come back up to the party?",
        "Gus: I'll be up in a minute, in a little bit. I'll see you up there. I've got to take this call.",
        "Alan: I didn't hear a ring.",
        "Gus: Yeah, well I've got it on vibrate.",
        "Alan: Okay.",
        "Gus: All right. What is your problem, al? You're killing me.",
        "Jeffrey: Gus, can you hear me? What's the deal down there.",
        "Gus: When I came down to the wine cellar, Alan was already here. He said he was picking out wine.",
        "Jeffrey: And you believe him?",
        "Tammy: This is the lamest night ever. I was having the greatest time with Joey until my team lost the ticket challenge. Now I'm stuck doing kitchen duty. Do you even know what these things are? They smell really fishy.",
        "Cassie: That's great, honey. I'll hear about this later, okay?",
        "Tammy: Mom, are you listening to me?",
        "Olivia: Brad. How about we talk shop, huh?",
        "Brad: Oh, absolutely.",
        "Tammy: Fine. If you're more interested in the party than your own daughter...",
        "Cassie: No. No, honey. I want to hear about this. I do. I just have to do something real quick. Coming up on \"Guiding Light\"...",
        "Gus: Cassie is down here.",
        "Harley: Phillip. Phillip, it's not what you think. oprah: Decorating on a budget with.",
        "Bill: Get that drink later. Oh, my goodness. So did my dad send you here, huh, complete with the worried look, sad voice? Because I've been getting a lot of that lately.",
        "Josh: And you're going to keep getting a lot of it. A lot of people are going to be asking you how you're doing.",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Josh: Believe me, I know. I've been there. So when your dad told me you were going to be here...",
        "Bill: Ah, there you go. So he did send you here. That's...",
        "Josh: I just know that you're going through a bad time right now.",
        "Bill: You have no idea.",
        "Josh: Actually, I do. I just wanted to say that if you need some time off work, I can step back in.",
        "Bill: Oh, uncle josh, please, work is good for me right now, and my job performance lately through the roof. So...",
        "Josh: Well, so was your dad's when he was drinking heavily.",
        "Bill: Uncle J... this is me having a good time, that's all. Look, I appreciate your concern. I really do. But I'm going to tell you something about Eden. She wouldn't want me sitting home hiding from the world. She would want me to get out, have a little fun, and that's...",
        "Josh: I understand that. It's going to take you some time to get over her death.",
        "Bill: I'm on my way. Eden's taught me so much-- to land on my feet. Nothing is as it seems, even death.",
        "Josh: What does that mean?",
        "Bill: It's just not an end. It's a beginning.",
        "Josh: You don't have to be so brave about it, you know. You loved her. I know that.",
        "Bill: I did. And Eden loved so many people.",
        "Joey: I think I'm going to give Tammy a break, take her tray around for a while.",
        "Lizzie: No, no, no, no. Don't do that. She's the loser, Joey. She lost the ticket challenge.",
        "Joey: Tammy's no loser, Lizzie, ever. I'm going to go help her out.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, my gosh.",
        "Joey: What? What?",
        "Lizzie: I lost my earring, and grandpa gave me them, and they're real expensive, and if I don't find them then...",
        "Joey: What?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, my gosh. He's going to be so mad, Joey, he's going to take it out on all of us at work. You've got to help me retrace my steps. Come on, let's go.",
        "Remy: What's that all about? Lizzie pushes that team around like she owns them.",
        "Harley: Marina, do not sneak up on...",
        "Brad: Hello, Harley. Find anything interesting?",
        "Gus: What's going on with Harley? She got anything on brad green?",
        "Jeffrey: We don't know yet. What's the verdict on Alan?",
        "Gus: Not guilty. I didn't know how I'd feel with my judgment when it came to my old man, but I've got to tell you, I believed him just now. He's not our guy.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, check the cellar just in case, because he may have planted something down there before you got there, okay?",
        "Gus: Right. I'm on it.",
        "Josh: Okay, you know what? I have to go track down Reva. She was supposed to be here a while ago. Do you want to come with me?",
        "Bill: No, no. I'm good here. I'm good here.",
        "Josh: All right. If you change your mind about work...",
        "Bill: No, I won't. I won't.",
        "Josh: And if you need anything...",
        "Bill: I'm going to call.",
        "Josh: Okay. I'll see you.",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Danny: Checking in. Anything new?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, there's not much here, but the wine cellar seems to be getting a lot of traffic. Is that the money?",
        "Danny: No, it's a fashion statement. As soon as I make this drop, it's over. Michelle and I are free.",
        "Jeffrey: What about vinnie? Is he ready? Is he there for the takedown?",
        "Danny: Yeah, I took care of it. Vinnie's in for the night.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, good.",
        "Tony: Danny, come on, danny. Danny, answer the phone, please. Answer the phone. Danny? Danny, it's me. Listen, you've got to call me back, man. Vinnie's gone. Please call me back.",
        "Jeffrey: Turn your cell phone off. The signals' going to interfere with the...",
        "Danny: It's off.",
        "Jeffrey: All right, Gus, what's going on down there?",
        "Phillip: I'm not sure that I really want to know, but if the intent was to get rid of brad for the moment, then you're welcome.",
        "Harley: Thanks, Phillip.",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm. It's a very interesting night. Night of the exes. Beth had me cornered before, now this.",
        "Harley: Yeah. And what about your wife du jour? Nice dress.",
        "Phillip: Yeah. I don't know what's going on with her. She's been ditching me all night.",
        "Bill: Well, you look beautiful, olivia.",
        "Salerno: Who knew you could sneak up on a psychic?",
        "Gus: Cassie is down here.",
        "Jeffrey: Get ready, Gus.",
        "Bill: Olivia, don't you get it?",
        "Olivia: It's going to be better.",
        "Bill: I feel better sitting right here.",
        "Olivia: You need to talk to me.",
        "Bill: Will you please stop?",
