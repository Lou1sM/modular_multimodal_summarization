        "Gus: All right. There it is, the hotel of our \r\ndreams. ",
        "Harley: We've said that about a lot of hotels \r\ntonight, haven't we? ",
        "Gus: Yeah, but this is the one. The one under \r\nthe Brooklyn Bridge. The only one under the Brooklyn\r\nBridge that looks like the stationery. ",
        "Harley: You're pretty smart, aren't you? I \r\njust think you're hopped up on ice cream. ",
        "Gus: Well there's that. The bottom line is we \r\nhave to find Phillip\u2019s killer and get you your life back, okay? Let's go. \n",
        "",
        "Marina: So what do we do next? Lay a trail \r\nfor these bounty hunters? I feel like I'm in a bad movie every time I say that.\r\n",
        "Danny: I know. So do I. So stop saying it.\r\n",
        "Marina: We want people to think I'm Harley to \r\nkeep them away from her. ",
        "Danny: Not exactly. You can't be too good at \r\nbeing Harley, because we need to protect her without letting you get hurt.\r\n",
        "Marina: Look at you, all macho and \r\nprotective. ",
        "Danny: Marina, come on, this is a very \r\nserious, very tricky situation. So you think you can follow my lead? ",
        "Marina: Yes. ",
        "Danny: You think you can do that? All right. \r\nI guess we should, um, hit the streets of Chicago, Harley Cooper. ",
        "Marina: All right, Gus. ",
        "Danny: You're working on my last nerve.\r\n",
        "Marina: ( Laughs ) ",
        "",
        "Sebastian: No worries, Alan. I'm on it. If \r\nHarley\u2019s in this hotel, I will find her. Excuse me, I'm looking for a friend of \r\nmine, Gus Aitoro from Springfield. Does that sound familiar? It\u2019s... it's very important that I find him.\r\n",
        "Concierge: I think there is somebody here by \r\nthat name. ",
        "Sebastian: You think, or you know? \n",
        "",
        "Dinah: You're playing both sides against the \r\nmiddle. Like getting Alonzo to get Will so you can look like a hero to Cassie.\r\n",
        "Edmund: I'm doing what's best for Cassie and \r\nWill and me. We belong together and I'm going to do whatever it takes to make \r\nthat happen. ",
        "Dinah: That ought to do it. ",
        "Edmund: All right. All this painting has made \r\nme hungry. ",
        "Cassie: Oh, okay. Well you know what? I can \r\npull something together for you. ",
        "Edmund: No, no. Better yet, let's call it a \r\nday and head over to Towers. ",
        "Cassie: I'm a mess. ",
        "Edmund: Absolutely nonsense. You're \r\nbeautiful. You go change; I'll finish up here, make reservations. ",
        "Cassie: Okay. Well, sounds great. ",
        "Edmund: Good. Thank you. I'll take care of \r\neverything. ",
        "Dinah: Hello. Getting ready for a big night \r\nout with the little woman, huh? ",
        "Edmund: Yes, I am. And you have excellent \r\nhearing. ",
        "Dinah: Well, save some energy; I'll be \r\nwaiting up for you. ",
        "Edmund: Dinah... ",
        "Dinah: Edmund. I need a man and I want you \r\nand you need me to keep your dirty little secret so you can have Cassie. Now, if \r\nyou play nice, we both can get what we want. ",
        "",
        "Nate: Hello. How was your day off? \n",
        "Reva: Fine. Fine. It... well, no, actually, \r\nit wasn\u2019t. ",
        "Nate: You must have had a little chat with \r\nyour boy. ",
        "Reva: No, I haven\u2019t. And ever since you told \r\nme what he did, it's been driving me crazy. ",
        "Nate: It would drive me crazy if I thought my \r\nkid was feeding girls date rape drugs. ",
        "Reva: It's just that Jonathan hurt Tammy when \r\nhe first came to town, but he's changed. He has, and he's made a life for \r\nhimself here so why would he jeopardize that by doing something so stupid?\r\n",
        "Nate: Well, I suppose you could just keep \r\nquiet and hope nothing happens. ",
        "Reva: Oh, gee, thanks. You've made me feel so \r\nmuch better. ",
        "",
        "Jonathan: You stay away. Nate: You are going \r\nto choose me, hmm? You're going to choose the only father that ever loved you or \r\nyou are going to be sorry. ",
        "Tammy: Here with all your friends? \n",
        "Jonathan: Later, okay? Not a good time.\r\n",
        "Tammy: What, no snappy comment? No \r\ninappropriate sexual come-on? ",
        "Jonathan: What's wrong with you? ",
        "Tammy: For no good reason you attacked me in \r\nyour room the other day. Since then you've been avoiding me. And all of a sudden \r\nit occurred to me you've been trying too hard. Why? ",
        "Jonathan: I've been busy. ",
        "Tammy: Well, you're not busy right now. Sure, \r\nI'll have a drink. ",
        "Nate: I'm sorry if I upset you. ",
        "Reva: You didn\u2019t. ",
        "Nate: Isn't that your boy? ",
        "Reva: Oh, my God. Tammy, what are you doing \r\nhere all by yourself? ",
        "Jonathan: She's not by herself. Whoa! What's \r\nwrong with you? ",
        "",
        "Edmund: Say whatever you want to Cassie, \r\nDinah, but you do so at your own risk. ",
        "Dinah: Come on, you wouldn't hurt me. I'm \r\ncarrying your child. ",
        "Edmund: Not forever. ",
        "Dinah: Fine. If you're not going to help me, \r\nI am sure I'll find out a man out there who will. ",
        "Edmund: No, no, no. I'm not going to let you \r\nwander around Springfield picking up aimless men. ",
        "Dinah: Oh! Oh! Is somebody jealous? \n",
        "Edmund: Dinah, this ridiculous \r\nconversation... ",
        "Cassie: Okay. I'm ready. What'd I miss?\r\n",
        "",
        "Harley: Not very busy. ",
        "Gus: Hi, how are you? I was wondering if \r\nmaybe you could help me out and my wife. We're looking for a guy that had \r\nintroduced us... we just got married and he introduced us. We met in Central \r\nPark. ",
        "Harley: This man. ",
        "Concierge: Sure, Steve Wallace stays here all \r\nthe time. ",
        "Gus: Steve Wallace! ",
        "Harley: Steve Wallace! ",
        "Gus: Wally. ",
        "Harley: He doesn't happen to be staying here \r\nright now, is he? ",
        "Concierge: As a matter of fact, I believe he \r\nis. ",
        "Gus: You are kidding me. That's good. \n",
        "Harley: That's very, very, very, very good.\r\n",
        "Gus: We're just... we're very excite about \r\nseeing Mr. Steve Wallace again, aren't we, honey? ",
        "Harley: We can't wait to thank him for what \r\nhe did for us. Is he in his room? ",
        "Concierge: I believe he's out right now.\r\n",
        "Harley: What room number is that? ",
        "Gus: Honey... ",
        "Harley: Sorry. That's so inappropriate. When \r\nwill he be back? ",
        "Gus: Um, does he have a favorite restaurant \r\nthat he frequents? ",
        "Concierge: Why does this look like this was \r\ntaken from a security camera? ",
        "Gus: ( Laughs ) ",
        "Harley: ( Laughs ) ",
        "Gus: June Bug, what did I tell you? She's not \r\nmuch of a photographer. She buys the cameras in the supermarket. Lighting, I \r\ntold you lighting. Thank you. But we'll... you know, thanks. Okay. ",
        "Harley: Do you think he bought it? \n",
        "Gus: Not really. But at least he didn't \r\nrecognize you. I don't think he did, anyway. ",
        "Harley: Steve Wallace! Now we wait. \n",
        "Gus: Yes, yes, we wait. We wait. ",
        "Harley: I can almost feel the boys' arms \r\naround me. If this works out... ",
        "Gus: I know, baby. I know this is taking a \r\nvery long time, but I promised you, I promised you I'd get you out of this mess.\r\n",
        "Harley: It's okay. Because you never stopped \r\nbelieving in me. ",
        "Gus: I never will. ",
        "Harley: Do you know what this means? If we \r\nfind the person who's really killed Phillip, I might actually be able to start \r\nbreathing again. ",
        "Gus: I know. I know. ",
        "",
        "Dinah: Hi, Cassie. I was just saying to \r\nEdmund that I need to find something that helps me relax, something nice. \n",
        "Cassie: I just bought a few magazines. You \r\ncan go inside, lie on the couch, put your feet up, read some magazines. \n",
        "Dinah: I was just thinking about lying down.\r\n",
        "Edmund: Do whatever you like, Dinah. Cassie \r\nand I were going out. ",
        "Dinah: I'm going to go out, too. I'll let you \r\ntwo enjoy your dinner. ",
        "Cassie: Well, thank you. ",
        "Dinah: You two love birds save some room for \r\ndessert and entertainment. ",
        "Cassie: Are you going to change before we \r\nleave? ",
        "Edmund: Well, actually, with Dinah going out \r\nand R.J. over at Billy Flanagan\u2019s, we have the place to ourselves. ",
        "Cassie: Yeah, we. Do how about that? \n",
        "Edmund: So, we can do all of our celebrating \r\nright here. Unless, of course, you're counting on dinner at Towers? ",
        "Cassie: No. I think it's going to be great.\r\n",
        "Edmund: Great. Then leave everything to me.\r\n",
        "Cassie: All right. I'm going to go call Frank \r\nand see if there's any word on Harley. ",
        "Edmund: Okay. Great. ",
        "Cassie: I'm really happy that everything's \r\nworking out, Edmund. ",
        "Edmund: Good. Because all the bad days are \r\nbehind us, Cassie. No more secrets. Everything is going to be out in the open.\r\n",
        "Cassie: I really want to believe that. I do.\r\n",
        "Edmund: You can, because it's true. \n",

        "",
        "Reva: I'm sorry. I overreacted when I... it \r\nwas my mistake. What can I get you? ",
        "Jonathan: It was for Tammy. You can ante up \r\nwith her. ",
        "Reva: What can I get you drink? ",
        "Jonathan: I know what she wants. I'll get it.\r\n",
        "Reva: No! Tammy, you order whatever you want \r\nto drink. I need talk to Jonathan a minute, okay? ",
        "Tammy: Yeah. ",
        "Reva: What was in that drink? ",
        "Jonathan: Soda. ",
        "Reva: Were you putting drugs in Tammy\u2019s \r\ndrink? ",
        "Dinah: Hi, Tammy. When Jonathan\u2019s done with \r\nhis mommy, can you tell him I need him? ",
        "Tammy: Sure. Anything for you. ",
        "Dinah: Thank you. ",
        "Tammy: What a freak. ",
        "Jonathan: Are you loaded? I didn't put \r\nanything in Tammy\u2019s drink. Why would you think that? ",
        "Reva: I heard something about you. \n",
        "Jonathan: From who? ",
        "Reva: Does it matter? It was about how you're \r\nputting stuff in girls' drinks that you were planning on doing the same to \r\nTammy. ",
        "Jonathan: Who said that? ",
        "Reva: My boss heard some things. ",
        "Jonathan: Your boss? So now you listen to \r\nanybody who's willing to trash me. ",
        "Reva: Were you going to drug Tammy\u2019s drink?\r\n",

        "Jonathan: That is not mine! Reva, somebody \r\nset me up. It's the truth. ",
        "Reva: Yeah. ",
        "Jonathan: Reva, this is somebody's idea of a \r\nbad joke. Mom, come on, you've got to believe me. ",
        "Reva: This is yours? ",
        "Jonathan: What's with you? ",
        "Reva: I can't believe you. After everything \r\nwe've been through, we're right back to square one, is that it? You're putting \r\ndrugs in Tammy\u2019s drink and yet you're looking me in the eye and lying to me?\r\n",
        "Jonathan: You know, I told you not to expect \r\ntoo much from me and you're the one that didn't listen. ",
        "Reva: Come on. We're leaving. ",
        "Tammy: But... ",

        "Jonathan: Not interested. ",
        "Dinah: Come on, get interested. I have to \r\nstraighten out Edmund and help him figure out I'm the girl for him, the person \r\nwho's going to love him for who he is. ",
        "Jonathan: I'm not interested. You're on your \r\nown tonight, dynamite. ",

        "Jonathan: It was you, wasn't it, who planted \r\nthose drugs on me? ",
        "Nate: You were going soft, kiddo. You heard \r\nthese people tell you that they loved you and you believed them. You thrived on \r\nit. ",
        "Jonathan: So you had to ruin it. ",
        "Nate: No, I didn\u2019t. I just lifted the curtain \r\non the ugly truth. They don't love you, kid. I'm the only one that cares about \r\nyou. ",

        "Danny: I think we should just lie low until \r\nmorning. ",
        "Marina: Morning? Tomorrow morning? \n",
        "Danny: That would be tomorrow morning. We \r\ntold the porter we're flying out in the morning so that would suggest that we're \r\njust going stay in for the rest of the night. ",
        "Marina: Yeah. I guess it does. ",
        "Danny: Do you want to... you didn't bring \r\nanything. Do you want to take a shower or a bath? I can... ",
        "Marina: It's okay. I'll just use the sink \r\nand... ",
