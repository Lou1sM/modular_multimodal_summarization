        "Jeffrey: Gus, I know you can't respond, so just listen. We can't do anything about Cassie getting in the way down there. So for her own protection, if something happens, take her in, and anyone else who gets involved for that matter. You got it?",
        "Harley: It's terrier. I don't like this. Cassie and Edmund are tight. How could he think she wouldn't be by his side all night? There's no way he'd risk her finding out.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I'm just concerned about the big picture right now. Cassie's paranoid, and she's running on emotions. She could compromise this whole investigation. We need a break.",
        "Edmund: Why did you follow me down here, Cassie?",
        "Cassie: That box. It's just like the box you gave vinnie Salerno, and it sailed through customs in your diplomatic mailbag.",
        "Edmund: Yes, it did. What are you talking about?",
        "Cassie: And you knew no one was going to see it, not even the police.",
        "Edmund: The police?",
        "Cassie: I mean, this is perfect, Edmund. It's just perfect, isn't it?",
        "Edmund: What are talking about?",
        "Cassie: Edmund, why did you do it? Was it the money? Was Salerno blackmailing you?",
        "Edmund: Blackmailing me into doing what?",
        "Cassie: Oh, come on, Edmund! I am not an idiot, okay? Would you just admit it? You have been running drugs into this country from San Cristobel.",
        "Edmund: Drugs?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Okay, Reva, where are you? Reva?",
        "Salerno: Glad I caught up with you. You got a minute?",
        "Reva: Actually, no. I'm meeting my husband.",
        "Salerno: No, no, maybe you could make some time.",
        "Reva: Mr. Salerno...",
        "Salerno: Vinnie.",
        "Reva: Mr. Salerno, you know, maybe we could do this some other time. You could come to the studio.",
        "Salerno: Yeah, you know, I just want to tell you how amazing you were the other day, you know? Everything you predicted came true. I'd like to find out just how much more amazing you can be.",
        "Tammy: Uncle josh, you should be dancing.",
        "Josh: Hello. Yes, I would like to be dancing, but I can't find my wife. And I don't understand where she is. (Chuckles)",
        "Tammy: Ah. Stood up.",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Tammy: I know how you feel. You haven't seen Joey anywhere, have you?",
        "Josh: No. Sorry.",
        "Joey: You're trippin', Lizzie. Tammy would never kiss Edmund.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Look, Joey, I'm sorry. I never would have said anything. I thought you knew.",
        "Joey: Whoa. Stop. Just start from the beginning.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. It was after \"Romeo and Juliet.\" Tammy and Edmund were on the balcony alone. And I don't know what the deal was, but I just know they were definitely swapping spit.",
        "Joey: No. No, no, no. Wait. That is gross, okay? There's no way... you saw them?",
        "Lizzie: I know it's weird and everything, but I had front-row seats.",
        "Joey: Then what happened?",
        "Lizzie: Then Cassie found out because she read Tammy's journal. Tammy freaked out, locked herself in her room. But you were the one who talked her out of her room. How could you have done that if you didn't even know what was going on?",
        "Joey: I guess I'm just stupid, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: You look beautiful, olivia.",
        "Olivia: Don't.",
        "Bill: You do. You look beautiful. Amazing.",
        "Olivia: What are you doing here?",
        "Bill: It's a party.",
        "Olivia: I know. I thought you might want to be out there enjoying yourself.",
        "Bill: I'm enjoying myself right here with you.",
        "Olivia: I just thought that after everything you've been through with Eden, that maybe you'd want to cut loose a little bit.",
        "Bill: Look, you want to talk a little?",
        "Olivia: About what?",
        "Bill: Whatever pops up.",
        "Jeffrey: You ready, Danny?",
        "Danny: Believe me, nobody wants this over with more than I do. The sooner we nail Salerno, the quicker I can get my life back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: How could you possibly think I was running drugs?",
        "Cassie: Because Jeffrey told me.",
        "Edmund: Oh, of course.",
        "Cassie: Now, look, I know all about Salerno's drug operation, and I saw you with him. And Spaulding's involved in this somehow, and I saw you with Alan.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, you saw me talking to Alan Spaulding and giving something to a mobster. And you just knew that in your heart, it had to be this.",
        "Cassie (whispering): Cigars?",
        "Edmund: Cigars, Cassie. Cigars. Somebody call a cop.",
        "Cassie (whispering): That's a box of cigars. I thought that...",
        "Edmund: You thought they were drugs. Drugs, Cassie. Yes, I think you've made that perfectly clear.",
        "Cassie: Edmund...",
        "Edmund: They're for the Spanish ambassador. He's a personal guest of mine tonight.",
        "Cassie: I'm so sorry.",
        "Edmund: You could chide me, I suppose, for greasing the wheels of diplomacy with illegal contraband, but sometimes that's just how things get done.",
        "Cassie: I know.",
        "Edmund: And I did the same thing with Vincent Salerno because I needed a favor from him.",
        "Cassie: What could you possibly want from that man?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I wanted this party to be perfection.",
        "Cassie: I don't understand.",
        "Edmund: I wanted to give something back to you. I wanted to throw a fantastic, sensational, successful party in your hotel. And that meant making sure the right element was in attendance and wrong element was not. Vincent Salerno promised to stay away, and all it was going to take was a box of cigars.",
        "Cassie: Oh, my god. How could I be so stupid? Edmund?! Edmund?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: O'Neill, did you hear all of that?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, I heard. So now we know that Edmund isn't our man. Are we good to go?",
        "Gus: Yeah. Green light. I repeat we are green. Let's catch ourselves a big fish.",
        "Lizzie: Look, Joey, it's not that big of a deal. It was just a little kiss.",
        "Joey: Lizzie, I don't care how big the kiss was. They kissed.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah.",
        "Joey: Man.",
        "Lizzie: Look, I'm sure Tammy has her reasons for not telling you.",
        "Joey: Like what?",
        "Lizzie: I don't know. But I'm sure if you ask her, she'll tell you. I mean, I could probably come up with something, but it'll just make things worse. She'll tell you what was on her mind and... and... you know.",
        "Joey: Tammy's always talking about Edmund, always comparing me to him, asking his advice. Do you remember that one time that she gave him a scarf and then gave me the exact same one?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. That was kind of messed up.",
        "Joey: Messed up, right. I just let it slide. You know, I figured, hey, it's just better to act clueless sometimes, right? Look, I got to go.",
        "Lizzie: Joey, listen, don't be hard on Tammy, all right?",
        "Joey: What am I supposed to say to her?",
        "Lizzie: I really don't think she meant to hurt you.",
        "Joey: Lizzie, if you were me, what would you do? That's what I thought.",
        "Lizzie: Joey?",
        "Tammy: Lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: Tammy. (Laughs) I was just thinking about you.",
        "Tammy: Have you seen Joey?",
        "Lizzie: Actually, I think he's looking for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Salerno: Soon you'll be dancing the night away.",
        "Tony: Vinnie, where have you been, huh?",
        "Salerno: Hey, hey, whoa, what are you, keeping tabs on me now?",
        "Tony: No, no, I'm not. It's just you're here one minute; you're gone the next. I don't have keys. I'm locked out.",
        "Salerno: Where are your manners? You know Mrs. Lewis.",
        "Tony: Yeah. Mrs. Lewis, how are you doing?",
        "Reva: I'm being inconvenienced.",
        "Tony: That's not good. Not good.",
        "Salerno: We're going to fix all that, huh? Want a drink?",
        "Tony: I got to get you out of here. What's she doing here?",
        "Reva: Mr. Salerno, aren't you worried at all about being late for the gala?",
        "Salerno: No, I think I'm going to stay put tonight, you know? It's not my kind of crowd, or I'm not the kind of guest. Either way, it's mutual. Keep your shirt on. Don't mess me up.",
        "Tony: Vinnie, I don't understand. I don't understand what she's doing here. I don't. I'm sorry.",
        "Salerno: Antonio, can you go check on something or do something? Reva and I need a little privacy.",
        "Tony: Well, you know that... you know our friend in queens? Well, he's calling tonight, all right?",
        "Salerno: Well, take it on your cell.",
        "Tony: No, he's calling here. And you need to...",
        "Salerno: It's okay. I'll talk to him then, all right? Bye-bye.",
        "Reva: Um... you know, I'm so late for the gala already. My husband's probably called out the national guard.",
        "Salerno: Nah. You just tell him you had pressing business.",
        "Reva: Do we have business?",
        "Salerno: One of the many things I've learned in all the years of staying alive doing what I do, that it's never smart to waste a valuable asset. And right now, you're the best asset I've had in a very long time.",
        "Danny: Josh.",
        "Josh: Hey, Danny.",
        "Danny: How are you?",
        "Josh: Well, I'd be doing a lot better if I could find my wife.",
        "Danny: I haven't seen Reva, but there's a lot of traffic tonight. Everyone's headed over here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Yeah. Maybe that's it.",
        "Joey: Hey, guys, have any of you seen Tammy?",
        "Remy: You just missed her, man.",
        "Lindsey: She went that way, Joey.",
        "Joey: This is such a weird night. No one's where they're supposed to be and...",
        "Remy: What are you still doing here, Lupo? Go find your girl.",
        "Joey: Yeah, I got to go. I got to find Tammy.",
        "Jeffrey: So Edmund was totally clean after all.",
        "Harley: I hate that Cassie had to go through that, but it's not going to be the last time. No matter how much she loves Edmund, she cannot forget who he used to be.",
        "Gus: Whatever. Whatever. Yeah, my heart bleeds for the guy. He isn't a drug dealer; he's got chick problems. What's next?",
        "Jeffrey: We're back to the task at hand: Idling whoever making the drop of drugs for Salerno.",
        "Gus: Is danny on time with the cash?",
        "Jeffrey: Danny will do his job. Don't worry about him. Once we get Salerno with his hands on the drugs, we got him.",
        "Gus: Somebody's coming. Who are you missing up there?",
        "Jeffrey: I don't know yet. It better not be a waiter going down there. Gus, our unidentified subject, who is it?",
        "Harley: Can you see who it is, Gus? What's going on?",
        "Gus (whispering): Brad Green. Do you hear me? It's brad green. Do you hear me?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, copy that. Harley?",
        "Harley: I've got green coming out of the wine cellar.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Danny, time to make your move.",
        "Gus: I'm checking out the bag now. Oh, my lord. This is, like, a $1.5 million, maybe $2 million street value. So maybe it wasn't Alan after all, huh? It was Brad.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, Harley, you stay on brad. Gus, you get ready to nail brad when he comes down for the cash, okay?",
        "Harley: When do we get to slap the cuffs on him?",
        "Jeffrey: Don't worry. Just take it easy. We're going to get our rewards in due time. We don't want to make a mistake here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I made a terrible mistake.",
        "Edmund: Yeah. So, what's it like sharing your bed with a drug kingpin?",
        "Cassie: I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, Cassie, Cassie, Cassie, what's really just eating me up here is how you arrived at the conclusion you did.",
        "Cassie: I didn't want to, Edmund. I didn't want to, but I kept catching you in little lies, and I saw you with Salerno. What was I supposed to think?",
        "Edmund: I think, Cassie, you were supposed to trust me. You were supposed to have faith in me.",
        "Cassie: No, no, wait. After what I saw... after what I heard?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, what you thought you saw, what you thought you heard. Cassie, once you started, you never stopped telling me how much you loved me, how much I meant to your family. But I think... I think you were saying all that not because you believed it, but because you wanted to believe it.",
        "Cassie: No. No. No matter what I thought, no matter what I thought, I should have cornered you and made you explain everything to me.",
        "Edmund: Why didn't you?",
        "Cassie: I don't know.",
        "Edmund: You don't know? You don't know, Cassie, and that's just... it's not good enough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: Mr. O'Neill just ran out of here as though the place was on fire.",
        "Beth: Well, he's a busy man.",
        "Phillip: She says with more than passing interest.",
        "Beth: She did not.",
        "Alan: Well, if the man wants to leave, why question it? I'd rather make a toast.",
        "Phillip: Has anyone seen olivia?",
        "Alan: Phillip, how could you miss her?",
        "Beth: Oh, Alan. No, we haven't.",
        "Phillip: Okay. Well, if any of you do see her, would you...",
        "Alexandra: What, run the other way?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Listen, there are so many people here, it would be easy to misplace someone.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, Joey's probably just having fun.",
        "Lizzie: No, I just saw him a few minutes ago, and he was on his way to the lobby.",
        "Tammy: Well, are you sure he was looking for me? I'm starting to get the feeling that something's wrong.",
        "Lizzie: Well, of course he's looking for you. What else? He's your guy. He's taking you to the summer fling, isn't he?",
        "Tammy: Yeah, I don't know. I mean, something's not right. If you see him, will you tell him I'm looking for him?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: You're going to thank me in the morning.",
        "Bill: What, if I can't sleep tonight?",
        "Olivia: Drink up.",
        "Bill: I'm not worried about tomorrow.",
        "Olivia: That sounds like a song. Come on. You just belted back two scotches in ten minutes.",
        "Bill: Yeah, so why ruin it with a coffee chaser? All right, look. I'll meet you halfway, all right? No more drinking. We'll just talk.",
        "Olivia: All right. You're still hurting about Eden.",
        "Bill: Not the topic I would have picked, but...",
        "Olivia: Your feelings for her, or whatever you're trying not to feel, it's all that matters, bill.",
        "Bill: Oh, interesting. So now I'm defined by the death of my fianc\u00e9e. I would have thought you'd find me more interesting than that, olivia.",
        "Olivia: You can joke all you want to, but this is the kind of pain that's going to have you running up a bar tab every single night, and it's not going to solve anything.",
        "Bill: What's to solve?",
        "Olivia: What's to solve?",
        "Bill: Yes.",
        "Olivia: The woman you loved, the woman you were going to spend the rest of your life with, is gone. You're never going to see her again.",
        "Bill: Well, true, in a way.",
        "Olivia: What part did I get wrong?",
        "Bill: Well, you'd be surprised.",
        "Olivia: What?",
        "Bill: How about the part that I didn't want to talk about this, okay?",
        "Olivia: Don't do this. Don't deny this. Don't joke. You're in 20 kinds of pain, and you don't think you're allowed to feel anything.",
        "Bill: Goodness. You know what? This was a lousy idea. I don't think we should talk anymore.",
        "Olivia: Just talk to me.",
        "Bill: I just don't think we should do... okay, you're right. You're right. Olivia, you are right. I'm hurting, okay? I am in pain for reasons you can't even understand, all right?",
        "Olivia: Well, then talk to me. Come on, just talk to me.",
        "Bill: What do you think I'm trying to do now?",
        "Olivia: Really talk to me.",
        "Bill: Look...",
        "Olivia: Come on. Don't put yourself into self- destruct mode. It isn't fun, all right? You may not believe this, but in time, things are going to be okay.",
        "Bill: Olivia, don't you get it? I feel better just you sitting right here.",
        "Olivia: You're not... you need to talk to me.",
        "Bill: Will you please stop?",
        "Olivia: You are hurting, and you need to talk\u0097",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Salerno: I've got to tell you, I never met anybody like you, Reva.",
        "Reva: If I had a dollar for every time I've heard that...",
        "Salerno: Are you superstitious? Because I believe in life, there are no accidents. You see, everything happens in its own way, in its own time. You told me about that pizza place. Then I saw the news. Crash nearly took out the whole place.",
        "Reva: It's lucky you weren't there.",
        "Salerno: I'm a skeptical man. I'm a careful man. But it's still good to be lucky. You were my luck on that. If it wasn't for you, I'd be dead, or close to it.",
        "Reva: I really think you're overestimating my abilities, Mr. Salerno.",
        "Salerno: No, no, no. No, no, no. No. I canceled my plans because of your advice. I stayed in town because of you. And so far, I have no reason to regret that choice.",
        "Reva: Well, that's one of us.",
        "Salerno: I can tell you're not happy here. I can change that.",
        "Reva: By letting me get on with my evening.",
        "Salerno: I take care of the people who take care of me. Isn't that right, Tony?",
        "Tony: You're the great benefactor, vinnie.",
        "Salerno: You know, I don't know why I encourage you.",
        "Tony: Hey, must be my charm.",
        "Salerno: Reva, a proposition. I'll only tell you certain things about my business, and then you give me your take on it.",
        "Reva: My take?",
        "Salerno: Yeah, your take. Your vibe or whatever, about people, situations. Sounds like a good gig to me.",
        "Tony: Okay, well, vinnie, you've got to be kidding, right?",
        "Salerno: Hey, look. I let you stay, all right? Speak when spoken to.",
        "Tony: Vinnie, I'm sorry. I can't let this one go.",
        "Salerno: Did I ask your opinion?",
        "Tony: This woman? You can't bring her in here, man. She's... she's a flake. I'm sorry.",
        "Salerno: Hey, hey. Watch your mouth, all right? I'm sorry. He's so rude. Apologize.",
        "Tony: Maybe it was a coincidence, vinnie. Have you thought about that one? Huh? Maybe she just guessed what was going to happen at that pizza joint. Have you thought about that one, too? You really want to hand over the ability to make decisions to a psychic? What are you going to do? You going to call her 900 number when you want to make a move?",
        "Reva: Do I have a say in any of this?",
        "Salerno: Say yes. Listen, Tony, I've done my homework. This woman is talented. She'll be a very good asset to us. And that's enough out of you, all right?",
        "Tony: Vinnie, what are you going to do when she makes a move that lands you in handcuffs? Huh?",
        "Salerno: Tony...",
        "Tony: You think she's not going to double-cross you? No, I'm serious. And what about the other families, vinnie? You think that they're not going to be laughing behind your back? No. You want to know why? Because they're going to be laughing in your face, man. You realize that one? You think you're a man of respect? When that happens, you're going to be a joke.",
        "Salerno: You think I'm a joke, huh? You think I'm funny? But you won't know whether to laugh or cry.",
        "Tony: Why don't you listen to what I'm saying to you, vinnie? You brought me in for that-- to help you, to listen to what... do you understand that? You have to listen to me. Please.",
        "Salerno: I will take my own counsel. I will listen to who I want, when I want.",
        "Tony: She is an outsider, man. Vinnie, she is an outsider. You cannot let her in. Okay?",
        "Reva: Um, gentlemen. Really, you have a lot to discuss...",
        "Salerno: You stay put, all right?",

        "Salerno: Tony, look, I can tell you want to be a boss.",
        "Tony: Yeah, I do.",
        "Salerno: It's in every move you make. It's in everything you say, everything you don't say. But this? This is why you'll never be fit to take my place.",
        "Tony: And why is that?",
        "Salerno: Because you're young but you think old. You've got to think outside the box, five, ten steps ahead.",
        "Tony: Vinnie, give me one reason why she will not walk out this door and open her mouth about what we do here. Huh? What's one reason?",
        "Salerno: Well, that nice family, for one. Nice husband. Two boys-- Sandy and Shayne? Daughter Marah. You follow me, Reva?",
        "Reva: Yeah.",
        "Salerno: You see? Now get out. We've got business.",

        "Reva: I know. I...",
        "Salerno: He means well.",
        "Reva: I have a job, though. I really do. I have a job that I love, and I don't need another one.",
        "Salerno: No, no. I know that. I know that. But this is an offer.",
        "Reva: You know what Tony said? He's partially right. I really don't think you should trust my abilities, because I don't see the future exactly as it happens. But there are people out there who do, who could probably do what you need them to do better than I can.",
        "Salerno: No, no, no. I want you, okay? And I'm not used to people telling me no.",
        "Reva: I gather that. What's that?",
        "Salerno: Give me a figure. Compensation. Take a few minutes, let your mind wander. But write something down. You don't want me to be the one filling in the blanks.",

        "Tammy: I bet we're making the same wish.",
        "Josh: Well, I was wishing for my wife to show up.",
        "Tammy: And I was wishing that I could find Joey. See? Same thing.",
        "Josh: There you go. Of course, if Joey is anything at all like your aunt Reva, you're in trouble, because you're going to spend most of your relationship waiting for him to show up.",
        "Tammy: I never did think he was anything like aunt Reva, until tonight. I mean, he's always been there when I needed him. More like you, uncle josh.",
        "Josh: (Laughs) see, there's a little problem with us guys who are dependable. Sometimes we feel like being not so dependable. And my guess is that's where Joey is right now.",
        "Tammy: He's playing hard to get?",
        "Josh: Something like that, yes.",
        "Tammy: Have you ever done that?",
        "Josh: Well, I've tried. (Laughs) I just... I wouldn't worry about Joey if I were you. He's a good kid. I don't know him that well, but it's very clear to me that he knows that he has something special in you.",
        "Tammy: I wish I knew more about guys. I never really knew that many growing up. You know, maybe I'd be doing better if I'd had you around my whole life.",
        "Josh: Well, it didn't seem to help my daughter all that much.",
        "Tammy: Don't say that. You are a great dad.",
        "Josh: I appreciate your saying that, but the fact is, I was not able to do anything to keep Marah from having... just making serious mistakes with the men in her life.",
        "Tammy: Well, hey, maybe she's just waiting for a guy to come around who's as great as her dad.",
        "Josh: (Laughs)",
        "Tammy: Hey, I better continue my search.",
        "Josh: Okay, all right. I'll keep my eye out for Joey, and if I see him, I'll send him your way.",
        "Tammy: Thank you. You know, at least looking for Joey is giving me something to do tonight, because other than that, it's been so boring.",

        "Danny: Okay, Michelle. Vinnie puts his hands on this bag, it's over. It'll be safe for you to wake up.",

        "Edmund: No, Cassie, I'm not.",
        "Cassie: Well, you were hammering me for months that I had every right not to trust you, that you couldn't forgive yourself so why should I?",
        "Edmund: What?",
        "Cassie: Look, my point is, if you were so afraid that I was going to think the worst of you, why were you fanning the flames?",
        "Edmund: What flames?",
        "Cassie: You were sneaking around here. You were lying to me. I woke you up the other morning to tell you how much I loved you and that you could tell me anything. Now, you could have told me about this stupid plan then.",
        "Edmund: Stupid? Stupid?",
        "Cassie: Oh, come on. Come on, Edmund. I mean, what are we doing here, huh?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I have no idea.",
        "Cassie: There have been misunderstandings. There have been double meanings and there have been half-truths, okay? All for what? The greater good here?",
        "Edmund: Well, when you put it that way...",
        "Cassie: I'm right.",
        "Edmund: Oh, Cassie, on that point, you're exactly right. But drugs? Half- truths for the greater good of drugs? Couldn't it possibly have been for something else?",

        "Alan: Excuse me. Cassie, would you come with me just for a second? Ladies and gentlemen, if I could have your attention, please. I have a very important announcement to make at this time. Tonight we have had quite a magnificent evening, and we're very grateful to ambassador Winslow for pulling it off. He did a magnificent job, don't you think? (Applause) it's been quite a sparkling event. Now, he is keeping something under wrap, though. Yes. You see, he and I made a bet. I bet him that he couldn't pull off such a magnificent evening, and guess what? I lost. I lost big-time. (Laughter and applause) but now for the surprise. Cassie? Tonight benefits something very near to your heart. I want you to know that all of the money made here this evening-- and it's quite a lot-- goes to the building of a new wing on the children's museum of san Cristobel.",
        "Cassie: Wow, Alan. This is incredible. Did you promise Edmund this money?",
        "Alan: Well, yes. Of course. Let's make a toast, if we could. A toast, ladies and gentlemen, to the children.",

        "Bill: I'm sorry. I don't know why I just did that. I mean, I guess I just... (clears throat) I'm sorry.",
        "Olivia: No. Don't be sorry. I was pushing you to get in touch with your feelings. I just... I can't complain if they weren't the feelings I had in mind.",
        "Bill: Well, that was the alcohol that was kissing you. I mean, I like you, but... I mean, I admire you. I...",
        "Olivia: You're kissing me, and then brushing me off?",
        "Bill: No, I'm not brushing you off.",

        "Bill: This is what I... no disrespect.",
        "Olivia: It didn't feel like that.",
        "Bill: All right. Well, good. Good. I just, you know... the other day when I was angry and had a gun in my hand, you were there, and I'll never forget that. I mean, you're honest. You don't play games. You mean well. (Laughs)",
        "Olivia: Well, no one's ever really described me quite like that.",
        "Phillip: Oh, I don't know about that. But you're right, bill. Olivia is a rare creature. You do always know exactly what she's thinking. You know why? Because she doesn't have a deceitful bone in her body. No, with olivia, what you see is what you get.",
        "Olivia: I thought that you were with the other partygoers.",

        "Phillip: How are you holding up, bill?",
        "Bill: Uh, good. Good. In fact, olivia was just trying to comfort me about Eden.",
        "Phillip: Well, I'm not surprised. That's the way she is. She's always finely attuned to the needs of others, always willing to give freely of herself to those in need.",
        "Olivia: Um, we were kind of in the middle of something.",
        "Phillip: Yeah. Phillip: Yeah. Phillip: Yeah. That's what it looked like. But, bill, you don't mind if I pull my wife back to the party? That dress is just going to waste in here.",
        "Bill: I can't agree with you on that, but she is your wife.",
        "Phillip: And I am so proud.",
        "Olivia: We can do this some other time.",
        "Bill: Yeah. I'd like that.",
        "Phillip: Good luck, bill. Oh, and listen, I am sorry about Eden. Getting through the grief of a tragic loss can be a very difficult thing, but I'm sure you'll find a way.",

        "Danny: Where are you going to be?",
        "Jeffrey: I've got to wrap up a few things here first. Oh, and give me your comm system.",
        "Danny: No, no. There's no time for that. Let's go. Come on.",
        "Jeffrey: Danny, it's not exactly a wise idea to be walking into the club wired for sound, now, is it?",
        "Danny: If he sees the wire, so what? A wire and a smile on my face will be the last things he sees before you haul him off.",
        "Jeffrey: You're becoming a loose cannon at the 11th hour? Okay, look, keep the wire. Do your job and get out of there.",

        "Tammy: About what?",
        "Edmund: It doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter. Tammy... you know, I never apologized to you.",
        "Tammy: For what?",
        "Edmund: For jumping to a whole lot of conclusions when you and Joey... well, up at the cabin, about what you and Joey might have... I made assumptions, and I shouldn't have done that. I'm sorry. They always end up badly.",
        "Tammy: What's going on, uncle Edmund?",
        "Edmund: \"Uncle Edmund.\" I like hearing that. It doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter. Tammy, you are young, you are vibrant and you are full of life. You and Joey, be honest with each other about everything. Talk about... rehash every plan, every intention, everything, until you're blue in the face, because it's worth it.",
        "Tammy: Some \"don't make the same mistakes I did\" advice?",
        "Edmund: Yeah. I'm sorry. I guess I'm a little too sad to hone a rapier wit.",
        "Tammy: The best cure for sadness? A hug from somebody who cares.",
        "Edmund: Yeah, well, in my life, I guess those people have just been in short supply... (applause)",
