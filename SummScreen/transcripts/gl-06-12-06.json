        "Coop: Look, I... I have this ring, which is kind of special. I picked it out with... with a member of my family. If you don't like it, we can always exchange...",

I know we're just getting the license and it's not the wedding or anything, but I should... I should change into something more designer, something more, like, that would go really, really well with the ring!",
        "Mallet: Mallet. Hey, how's it going. Good, you in town now? All right, then let's meet. Ah, yeah. Got it. Okay. Hey, Dinah, sweetie.

        "Dinah: No, no. Not at all. I was just being a knucklehead. We... had a little argument and I put my foot too much on the gas, and you know... I don't know. Every time he drinks coffee like this at night, it makes me nuts. He wants to stop by CO2, he wants his coffee, he can't shut up.",
        "Nathan: He needs a fix.",
        "Gus: Yeah, sue me.",

        "Lizzie: Of course! She's only going to be the most loved, happiest baby in the entire world. I really thought that I was going to have to do this alone. Say hi to your dad, Jenna!",

        "Reva: You know what? Don't worry. I'm not staying.",
        "Jonathan: Reva, what's the big deal? There was a time when you would have killed for me to do the \"dutiful son\" thing.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, there was a time I would have killed for you to do the \"dutiful daddy\" thing too. Because even though you're in denial, it's... it's not that it's not real. Okay, so it was an accident...",
        "Jonathan: We're talking about your accident...",
        "Reva: No, we're talking about you and that little girl you're getting ready to abandon.",

        "Dinah: I can't believe you live like this. Do you know I've seen kitty litter I'd rather play in?",
        "Gus: I'm not really sure how I hit that wall. I've been meaning to work on the brakes.",
        "Dinah: You know, huh? Do you know how you hit that wall? You were high, Gus. You're still high right now. You are still high!",
        "Gus: Prescription.",
        "Dinah: You know what, bud? I'm going to tell you something. I've been where you are... right now. I've been at the bottom. But I'm going to give you a little news flash right now: I'm not covering for you anymore. Do you hear me?",
        "Gus: What are you talking about, cover for me? It was a little baby fender- bender, that's what...",
        "Dinah: That wasn't a fender- bender. Do you know that you almost hurt yourself? Do you know that you almost hurt somebody else? And what do you think Harley's going say about this?",
        "Gus: ( Groans )",
        "Dinah: The way she reacted when she found out about the pills, what do you think?",
        "Gus: Let me ask you something, have you spoken to Harley? I bet you haven't. But I bet I know who has. Mallet. I bet he's talking to her right now. I bet he's been talking to her every single day since I'm out of the picture. And I bet he's holding her, and caressing her. And I bet it's just a matter of time before they actually hook up. ( Slap )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Did you check and see if he's still in the prison system?",
        "Regina: Yeah. O'Malley got out a few weeks ago.",
        "Mallet: Ugh.",
        "Regina: God, you remember all the fun he used to have in court watching the D.A. try to prove that he was the one sending those threatening notes to the jurors?",
        "Mallet: And no one could prove a thing. And he beat the murder one charge...",
        "Regina: Yeah, but we got him for manslaughter.",
        "Mallet: Yeah.",
        "Regina: And now...",
        "Mallet: Looks like he's looking for revenge.",
        "Regina: Mm-hmm.",
        "Mallet: Well, you know what? He's not going to get it.",
        "Regina: I wouldn't be so sure about that. I mean, he knows where we work, where we live. He knows where you do your dry cleaning. For all we know, he's watching us now.",
        "Mallet: I'm glad you contacted me. I was thinking those notes were for my fianc\u00e9e.",
        "Regina: Fianc\u00e9e?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, you know what, will you excuse me? I should call her and let her know that she's not the one in danger.",
        "Regina: Oh, yeah, of course.",
        "Mallet: Um... would you do me a favor? No one knows that um... well... we haven't told anybody that we're engaged. So I'd appreciate it if...",
        "Regina: Why is it a secret?",
        "Mallet: That's a good question.",
        "Frank: Oh, Mallet, excuse me. What's this? Hm?",
        "Mallet: Uh... I don't know, Frank. Looks like a DVD.",

        "Mallet: Oh it is? Really? Great, cool.",
        "Frank: Yeah, yeah, it's a good episode. You know what my favorite part is?",
        "Mallet: What?",
        "Frank: At the end.",
        "Mallet: With the gun, right?",
        "Frank: No, no, actually, when you and Dinah get engaged. Were you ever going to tell anybody about that?",

        "Lizzie: Ava. Hey. What are you doing here?",
        "Ava: Oh, my friend Jerry, he's on duty. So I thought I would stop by and apologize for our last date. You guys are...?",
        "Lizzie: Getting a marriage license. No, I know, I know, I was totally surprised too, but... Coop asked me to marry him, and I said yes.",
        "Ava: Well... congratulations.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, would you give me just a second?",

        "Lizzie: A witness?",
        "Clerk: Yeah.",
        "Lizzie: Is that really necessary?",
        "Clerk: It's the law.",

        "Jonathan: What's up with these?",
        "Reva: Where'd you find these?",
        "Jonathan: They fell out of your bag when we dodged the car. Go ahead, read the label. It says something about the side effects of chemo?",
        "Reva: Well, they're not mine.",
        "Jonathan: Your name is on the label.",
        "Reva: Well, you know, the pharmacy must have made a mistake. You know, they... they got the label wrong.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, right. Try again.",
        "Reva: You know what, they're... they're... they're antibiotics for the flu. I'm taking a lot of different prescriptions, you know? Vitamins, vitamin B and calcium. You know what I'm going to do, I'm going to go right down there now to that pharmacy and I'm going to straighten it out.",

        "Robert Newman, \"Inside The Light.\" Why do the women in Josh's life go crazy? Uh... I think most of them actually start quite sane, but I think there's something about being in between Josh and Reva that would drive anybody crazy. Well, I think also the fact that Reva continues to return from the dead probably drives most of my ex-wives crazy. See Josh, Wednesday, June 14, \"Inside The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Cancer. How bad?",
        "Reva: Well, it's hard to tell. You know, they've done a bunch of tests, and they're throwing a bunch of numbers at me, but... I guess the numbers aren't getting any better, if that's what you mean, but... don't worry about it, because I'm going to beat this thing.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. My money's on you.",
        "Reva: Yeah, I know. Thanks. You know, I let you go once before, and I... promised you the... this is just a bump in the road, or in my case, a lump in my breast.",

        "Reva: Yeah, can you figure that? I mean, I was on my way out of this place, and I was having a pain in my chest, and... a I thought it was from the seatbelt in that car accident that Billy and I were in, so. The doctor, you know, checked it, and she... she sent me for a mammogram, and then she sent me for another series of tests, and I couldn't even believe it. I mean, I... I really... I thought for sure that Dr. McCabe was going to come in and tell me that he'd made some terrible mistake.",

        "Coop: I mean, get married, Lizzie. Look, the justice of the peace is right down that hall. We can go there, we can grab some coffee or something, and... we can wait for our turn.",
        "Lizzie: Oh... okay.",
        "Coop: What? What is it?",
        "Lizzie: Nothing. Nothing, it doesn't matter.",
        "Coop: Do you want to call your mom, or you grandfather...?",
        "Lizzie: Listen. Okay, I get that you're just marrying me because I'm having your baby. And I get that you probably wish that you weren't such a great guy...",
        "Coop: Lizzie...",
        "Lizzie: Because then you'd get to be with Ava. But this is my wedding. And I don't want it to be some...",
        "Coop: Lizzie!",
        "Lizzie: ...Drive-thru Elvis wedding! I want my family...",
        "Coop: Lizzie! Stop! That's it! Okay, that's enough. Stop.",

        "Jonathan: You are such a hypocrite. You are ragging on me about family, about how I need to claim my baby, when you haven't even told your husband or anyone that you are sick. You give me all this bull about how I keep secrets, about how I'm living in denial. What about you, huh?",
        "Reva: It's just the wrong time. Josh is on the brink of the biggest achievement of his life.",
        "Jonathan: ( Groans )",
        "Reva: He is. A hospital, Jonathan. A community where thousands of people can have better lives. People who are heroes. This was H.B.'s dream. I mean, he could only dream about this. But Josh is making it happen. And I'm not going to stop that, because that's what'd happen. If he knew I was sick, he'd drop the whole thing so he could be with me. So I'm... I'm going to beat this disease so that we can have our life back.",
        "Jonathan: Maybe you just don't want to tell anyone because when you do, then it becomes real.",
        "Reva: What do you want me to do? Huh? You want me to put out a memo? \"Hey, I have cancer!\" ( Laughs ) You know, this is the happiest part of my life, the happiest time! I've never been happier in my life. But you know what? Cancer doesn't care! So treat me like I'm sick, you know? Give up everything. Give it all up, so that... so that you can hold my hand, so that you can clean up my puke, so that you can help me pick out a couple of wigs. What good could possibly come from that, Jonathan?",
        "Jonathan: Well, then you won't be alone.",
        "Reva: Well, I'm not alone. Not now. I'd kind of like to... get to know that grandchild of mine, too.",
        "Jonathan: ( Sighs ) You are unbelievable.",
        "Reva: I am. You know, I'm right. I am unbelievable, because I'm going to fight this thing like I've never fought anything before in my life.",
        "Jonathan: Hey. If you don't tell Josh, I will.",
        "Reva: Well, hey. I'll make you a deal. You come clean about getting Lizzie pregnant, and I'll come clean about Josh.",
        "Jonathan: That is not the same thing.",
        "Reva: You don't want to hurt Tammy. I don't want to hurt Josh. How is it so different? I'm not telling anyone that I'm sick. And neither are you. ( Sobs )",
        "Jonathan: Here.",
        "Reva: Thanks.",
        "Jonathan: So. Hey. What are you going to do about living with Josh? How are you going to hide the pills and the puking?",
        "Reva: I don't know, I've been doing pretty good so far. You know, because I'm smart. ( Laughs ) And stubborn.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah...",
        "Reva: And I'm pretty sneaky.",
        "Jonathan: And what happens if you fall down again? Like you did today?",
        "Reva: Just pick myself back up again.",
        "Jonathan: Doctors screw up. Did you get a second opinion? Are you sure this is for real?",
        "Reva: More sure than I want to be. ( Crying ) I'm glad you came back.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, your hair.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, it's the chemo. It's probably all going to come out pretty soon.",
        "Jonathan: This is really happening, huh?",
        "Reva: Yeah, it's really happening.",

        "Dinah: Gus. I've been where you're at. Like I said before. And do you know who pulled me out? Harley. She pulled me out and she helped me just like I'm going to help you, okay? First, we're going to take these pills. We're going to take these pills that I found in the car, and we're going to flush them down the toilet. Okay? We're going to get rid of them.",
        "Gus: That's been tried before. It doesn't work. It has to come from me. When those pills are in front of me, and I can walk away... that's when I've won. Just uh... go home to your fianc\u00e9e.",
        "Dinah: All right. You feel like a fix, then I want you to do me a favor, and you focus on Harley. Your kids, your future. And you give me a call if you need anything, okay? And I mean anything. I'm still proud of you.",

        "Ava: Do the right thing. The right thing, right? Yeah. You know what, sometimes I really wish that he wasn't wired that way.",

        "Coop: Stop. Stop, right there. That is exactly what I'm talking about, Lizzie. All right, I'm not doing this just for our baby. I'm doing this for us. You, me, the baby, all three of us. Look, I don't want to live together, to get married just for our baby, to put on a show for her. All right? I want to get married for real. I want to have a real wedding, a real life with you. All right? And I want to have more babies down the road.",

        "Coop: No, no, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Your heart is telling you to have a real, traditional wedding. I get that. ( Sighs ) Maybe, maybe we should. I know you're going to want photos to show the kids years from now, and... you know what, maybe that is what we should do. Maybe we should have a traditional wedding.",

I don't know nothing except change will come Year after year what we do is undone Time keeps moving from a crawl to a run I wonder if we're gonna ever get home You're out there walking down a highway And all of the signs got blown away Sometimes you wonder if you're walking in the wrong direction But if you breakdown, I'll drive out and find you If you forget my love, I'll try to remind you And stay by you when it don't come easy when it don't come easy, oh-oh.
