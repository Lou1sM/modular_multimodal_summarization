        "Gus: Hey.",
        "Harley: Hey.",
        "Gus: You waited up all night?",
        "Harley: I wasn't sure what time you were finishing up at the country club.",
        "Gus: I should have called. I'm sorry.",
        "Harley: No, it's okay. I totally understand how you can lose track of time working on an investigation like this.",
        "Gus: Yeah, I've got to change my clothes and go right back. The autopsy report's coming in.",
        "Harley: So I guess it wouldn't be a great time to talk.",
        "Gus: No. You know, like I said....",
        "Harley: No, it's fine, of course. It's not a problem it can wait.",
        "Gus: Okay. Coop?",
        "Harley: Yeah?",
        "Gus: Did Alan call? Because I asked him to call to make sure he got home safe.",
        "Harley: Alan called. He's fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Hey, honey.",
        "Shayne: Hey, Mom. Some guy called for you when you were in the shower.",
        "Reva: Guy. \"Some guy.\" Does he have a name or any distinguishing characteristics?",
        "Shayne: Oh, was I supposed to get a name?",
        "Reva: (Laughs sarcastically)",
        "Gus: I think it was Christopher something.",
        "Reva: Christopher Langham.",
        "Shayne: Yeah.",
        "Reva: Christopher Langham. What did he say?",
        "Shayne: He said he's still in town, but he's leaving soon. So you should call him. His number is right there.",
        "Reva: Thanks.",
        "Shayne: See you later.",
        "Reva: See you, sweetie.",
        "Josh: Hi. Where is Shayne?",
        "Reva: Upstairs. Why? What are you doing... You were at work.",
        "Josh: Yes. Yeah, I was at work, but I got a phone call from Shayne's coach. Apparently, he missed practice yesterday, so...",
        "Reva: Oh, wow. I'm sure he had a pretty good reason.",
        "Josh: Yeah, actually, it's happened twice. He's missed two practices so far this week, you know, and Shayne has a lot difficult decisions in ahead of him-- career decisions. You know, he's got agents who are interested in him and Stanford. Stanford is interested in him right now. So you know it's just not a good thing that he's missing...",
        "Reva: You know, now that you've mentioned it, since you're on the subject, I think maybe we should talk about...",
        "Josh: Yeah, you know what? Actually, I want to talk to Shayne first. Excuse me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I am still surprised you passed up cook's pancakes for the food here.",
        "Phillip: I like the food. And I don't see her. She must be caught in traffic.",
        "Lizzie: See who?",
        "Phillip: Olivia.",
        "Lizzie: That's why you brought me here? What are you trying to do? Get us together?",
        "Phillip: Honey, what happened the other night was not a good thing. Olivia is pregnant. Whether you like it or not, one way or the other, you're going to be related to this child. So you two need to come to an understanding. Since you don't seem to be managing it on your own, I'm going to facilitate it.",
        "Lizzie: You mean, we'll just miraculously be best friends?",
        "Phillip: At the moment, I'll settle for stability. As far as the future is concerned, that's up to you. You were friends before.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, until she stabbed Mom in the back. (Cell phone rings)",
        "Phillip: That's probably her. Yep, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: Hi. Are you on your way to Company?",
        "Phillip: No, I'm already here with Lizzie.",
        "Olivia: Oh, darn, I was hoping I could catch you, save you a trip.",
        "Phillip: Why? Where are you?",
        "Olivia: Something's come up today. I can't make it.",
        "Phillip: Okay. What came up?",
        "Olivia: Just some picky, boring stuff I have to do at the Beacon. I can't get there. I'm really sorry.",
        "Phillip: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Olivia: You know how much I want to do this with you, right? I'll tell you what. Later, we'll just put our calendars together and we'll reschedule this, okay?",
        "Phillip: Sure.",
        "Olivia: Okay. I'll talk to you later.",
        "Lizzie: Darn, Olivia can't make it?",
        "Phillip: That's okay, honey, it'll give us time to talk about school, whether it's going to be the academy or Springfield High next year.",
        "Lizzie: Actually, do you think you can take a rain check on that, too? You wanted to see Zach, remember? And Tammy and I should really study for our history final.",
        "Phillip: Tammy's been a good friend to you, helping you get back on track at school, hasn't she? I know it's been tough for you to make that change this late in the year.",
        "Lizzie: Yep, Tammy's the best. What can I say? And she promised to help me study for my history final.",
        "Phillip: All right. All right. But we're going to do this soon, okay?",
        "Lizzie: Sure.",
        "Phillip: You have a good day, darling.",
        "Lizzie: You, too, Daddy.",
        "Phillip: I'll see you later.",
        "Lizzie: Hey.",
        "Tammy: Hey. What are you smiling about?",
        "Lizzie: Christmas just came in June.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Olivia. Hello.",
        "Olivia: Hi.",
        "Dr. Sedwick: How are you feeling?",
        "Olivia: Great.",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Oh, good. Good. Now I understand that you've changed your mind. I mean, you've decided that you do want me to run a paternity test for you?",
        "Olivia: Yeah, please, but I just have one request.",
        "Dr. Sedwick: You want the results as soon as possible.",
        "Olivia: Well, that, yes, but mostly... Can you guarantee them?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Joshua.",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Reva: Would you come back in here, please? Just come back in here. Just for a minute.",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Reva: Do you hear yourself?",
        "Josh: Do I hear myself, what?",
        "Reva: How worked up you're getting over Shayne missing a couple of baseball practices.",
        "Josh: No. Well, it's not just practice, Reva. You have to think of it as sort an audition, you know? You never know who's watching him.",
        "Reva: Like someone from Stanford?",
        "Josh: Right. Or a scouting pro or an agent, you know.",
        "Reva: I thought we agreed that we were going to take Stanford's offer seriously?",
        "Josh: I thought we were going to take all offers seriously. And it's not really what we agree on, right? It's what Shayne wants. I mean, he's the one who's going to ultimately make all the decisions.",
        "Reva: That's right.",
        "Josh: And he's the one who is missing practices.",
        "Reva: Maybe that tells you something.",
        "Josh: Like?",
        "Reva: Like Marina was involved in a murder investigation and Shayne was there trying to support her through it. Or maybe our son has different priorities than you do.",
        "Josh: Well, he also has a future to think about.",
        "Reva: Yes. Yeah. And it's his future.",
        "Josh: You know what? I'd really like to deal with this, just one thing at a time, okay? So the first thing I want to do is talk to Shayne about missing practices.",
        "Reva: Right. I think it's the same thing.",
        "Josh: And I'd kind of like to do that in my own way.",
        "Reva: Meaning what? Meaning you want to him on your own alone?",
        "Josh: Yes. That would be a good thing. You know, we've sort of bonded over baseball. We have a common language with baseball.",
        "Reva: I see. Okay. Well, you go ahead then. You talk to him about all of this.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Reva: Mano a mano.",
        "Josh: (Laughs)",
        "Reva: And I'll just go to the grocery store like the good little woman I am. Do you want to call Shayne down here or...",
        "Josh: No. No, actually I've changed my mind about that. I think I'm just going to sit here and I'm going to wait for him.",
        "Reva: I'll be back.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Reva: In a bit.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: What are you talking about, Christmas in June?",
        "Lizzie: Nothing. It's just nice to get a break, that's all.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, I wish I could say the same.",
        "Lizzie: Believe me, I am due. My family is so messed up. I'll take whatever favors I can get. Like getting out of breakfast with the wicked witch of the west, so my dad can prove she's really not that bad after all. I mean, she separated my parents and practically humiliated my mother.",
        "Tammy: ...She broke your grandfather's heart. The list goes on and on.",
        "Lizzie: I'm sorry. Am I boring you?",
        "Tammy: You're like a person who hit the remote and got stuck on repeat. Every time I see you, you launch into the same sad story about Olivia and the horrible family you're stuck with, and how you wish it would all end.",
        "Lizzie: Well, I do.",
        "Tammy: Well, at least you have parents to complain about. Heck, you have a surplus of them. Well, me, I've lost two fathers, and the way things are going, I'm going to have another one soon who makes Olivia look like an angel. So do me a favor and count your blessings, okay? And save the complaining for those of us who have reasons to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Yeah. Yeah, that's perfect. All right, well, just tell Dr. Rick Bauer I'll be there as soon as I possibly can. All right, thank you. I stuck my head in to say good morning to the kids, give them a kiss, but they were still sleeping, so...",
        "Harley: So I guess you're going to rush off?",
        "Gus: Make that four murders in a row. Barely took a breather since last night.",
        "Harley: Well, see, I wanted to talk about last night.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: I wanted you to understand why I did what I did. I mean, why I worked on Eden's side without telling you about it. Why I wired that poor girl.",
        "Gus: The girl that's dead now.",
        "Harley: Yes. I need you to understand why.",
        "Gus: I do understand why. You don't like me working with Alan as my partner, isn't that right? I mean that is right. (Knock at door)",
        "Phillip: Good morning. Anybody awake? Hey.",
        "Harley: Hey.",
        "Gus: Awake? We didn't even go to sleep.",
        "Phillip: Oh, yeah. What happened at the country club last night?",
        "Gus: Well, didn't Alan tell you everything?",
        "Phillip: No, it's all over the news. What's Alan got to do with it?",
        "Gus: That's a very good question. I've got to go.",
        "Harley: Wait. When are you coming home?",
        "Gus: I don't really... I don't know.",
        "Harley: Unfortunately, Zach is still sleeping, but I'm sure he'll be up in just a little bit.",
        "Phillip: Something tells me I could have come at a better time.",
        "Harley: No, I mean it. He really is going to be up in a little while.",
        "Phillip: I'm talking about you and Gus.",
        "Harley: If there still is a me and Gus.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Oh, fake pass. Oh, look at that. Did you see that? Now you cannot buy instincts like that. That was great.",
        "Shayne: What are you doing here right now, Dad?",
        "Josh: Well, actually, I thought we could have a little talk about these practices that you've been missing. Now stay calm, all right? Because I'm not going to demand explanations from you. I'm not going to make you give me an account of your day-to-day activities. I just want to know if there's any problems at all that I need to...",
        "Shayne: There's no problem. There's no problem, Dad.",
        "Josh: You sure about that?",
        "Shayne: Everything's fine.",
        "Josh: Everything's fine.",
        "Shayne: Mm-hmm.",
        "Josh: You know, I've always thought that we had a pretty good relationship, son. That we can... We can talk about pretty much anything. And maybe that's because of all of that time that your mom spent away... Way back... Way back when. I hope that you know that I won't judge you, that you can tell me anything you want to tell me. So if something did change...",
        "Shayne: Dad, I missed a practice. It's no big deal.",
        "Josh: Well, actually you missed two practices. Two practices in one week.",
        "Shayne: Well, stuff come up.",
        "Josh: What stuff?",
        "Shayne: Stuff came up.",
        "Josh: What stuff?",
        "Shayne: It's no biggy, okay? Just leave it alone.",
        "Josh: It's a big deal, son. If you want a career in the pros, it is a big deal. Now you have to figure out how to focus. You have to figure out a way to keep your eye on the prize. Because if you can't...",
        "Shayne: Well.. You know what? Maybe baseball's not... Maybe baseball's not the prize I want. Did you ever think of that?",
        "Josh: Son. Son, you told me it's what you want. If I recall, we talked about it a couple weeks ago. And I asked you if it was what you wanted, if you were ready to commit, and you said to me...",
        "Shayne: Yeah, well, maybe... You know what? Maybe I changed my mind, okay?",
        "Josh: Why would you do that?",
        "Shayne: Because of the way you're pushing me. You keep pushing me. It's not even fun anymore. You're making me hate baseball.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Sedwick: The culture from your amnio is still available, so we can run this D.N.A. test in relatively short time. I mean, as these things go.",
        "Olivia: But it's still going to take some time, right?",
        "Dr. Sedwick: I'm afraid so.",
        "Olivia: Yeah. Okay. Listen, when you get the results could you...",
        "Dr. Sedwick: I'll get right back to you.",
        "Olivia: But... but by phone, okay? Don't send anything by mail or it could be opened by the wrong person. And if you get the machine, please don't leave any details, okay?",
        "Dr. Sedwick: I understand. Yes.",
        "Rick: Hi, Margaret.",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Hi, Rick.",
        "Rick: Good to see you.",
        "Dr. Sedwick: I'll call you.",
        "Rick: You okay?",
        "Olivia: Yeah, I'm fine.",
        "Rick: You look beautiful.",
        "Olivia: Thanks.",
        "Rick: How are you doing? Amy morning sickness, cramping, that sort of thing?",
        "Olivia: No, everything's great. Listen, I would love to chat with you, but I have a pile of work waiting for me at the Beacon. So I'll see you.",
        "Rick: Okay. Sure. Say hi to Phillip for me, okay?",
        "Olivia: I will.",
        "Gus: Rick.",
        "Rick: Hey.",
        "Gus: Hey.",
        "Rick: I got a message you'd be stopping by.",
        "Gus: Yeah, yeah. So did you get the results?",
        "Rick: Not yet. No. But I do know that she was injected with something right before she died. I found a fresh puncture mark in her right arm.",
        "Gus: A needle?",
        "Rick: Yes.",
        "Gus: So you think the killer took her out with a poison?",
        "Rick: Or a high dose of some sort of drug. I'll know more when the tox screen gets back.",
        "Gus: Well, the guy must be good with a needle if he worked that fast.",
        "Rick: With a one-shot hypodermic syringe, all it takes is two seconds.",
        "Gus: Yeah. Yeah, I knew a guy in Chicago on the force, used to get migraines. He used to use one of those types.",
        "Rick: Well, and some diabetics used them. Also people at risk for anaphylactic shock-- people allergic to shellfish, bees, that sort of thing.",
        "Gus: Right, right. No, this is good. This is good. Because then I can screen everybody in the room to see if they have that kind of condition, maybe to get access to that type of syringe. Anything else?",
        "Rick: Yeah. Let's talk for a second.",
        "Gus: What? What?",
        "Rick: There's probably is... There's probably no connection here. One of these victims happens to be a diabetic. So there is a possibility that they could have used this sort of syringe.",
        "Gus: Well, who?",
        "Rick: Ramona Hendon, the victim just before Ariana.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: Thanks. Anything you'd like to talk about?",
        "Harley: Do you want to hear my latest news?",
        "Phillip: Sure.",
        "Harley: I have developed this nifty little habit.",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm.",
        "Harley: I dig these really, really big holes for myself and then I jump right into them.",
        "Phillip: (Laughs) Are they so deep they you can't get out?",
        "Harley: Have you been there?",
        "Phillip: Well, see shovels are no longer good enough for me. I've moved on to bulldozers. Mm-hmm.",
        "Harley: Olivia?",
        "Phillip: Oh, yeah.",
        "Harley: Well, you had to know that was trouble going in.",
        "Phillip: I know.",
        "Harley: I'm just saying.",
        "Phillip: You know me when I get these strong urges...",
        "Harley: Mm-hmm.",
        "Phillip: ...I have a hard time ignoring them. And, you know, but it's not like I do it blindly, you know. I got a system.",
        "Harley: Mm-hmm.",
        "Phillip: I put one foot in front of the other, I come to a bump in the road, I make what seems like a reasonable adjustment. I come to anther bump, I make another adjustment. A turn here, detour there. I avoid all the potholes that I see.",
        "Harley: Mm-hmm. How's that working for you?",
        "Phillip: I have no idea where I am.",
        "Harley: (Laughs)",
        "Phillip: That's how it's working.",
        "Harley: All right, let me ask this. The bumps?",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm.",
        "Harley: Was the biggest bump for you guys, was it named Alan?",
        "Phillip: Ding, ding, ding.",
        "Harley: Because that's who it is for me and Gus. See I thought when you and I got divorced...",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm.",
        "Harley: ...I thought your father was going to go away. But, no, no, he's back. And with a vengeance.",
        "Phillip: Yeah, but he always gets to you. You always let him. He does. He pushes your buttons. I never understood why. It's not like he's your father, you know, but he does. He pushes your buttons.",
        "Harley: Okay, well, we are at our little go-around thing, right? He acts; I react. He's dictating all of my behavior for me.",
        "Phillip: Well, don't let him. You can turn that around. You can change it. All you have to do is start calling the shots.",
        "Harley: Is that what you're doing?",
        "Phillip: I'm trying.",
        "Harley: But you said that you're just finding yourself in total confusion with him.",
        "Phillip: Oh, no. No, my confusion is my doing.",
        "Harley: Oh. Whatever. I have to... I got to break this pattern that I have with Alan. And so do you. I don't... I don't know about you and Olivia. I mean, I don't know if you guys are meant for each other, but if you care about her-- and it seems like you care about her-- you shouldn't let something get in the... You shouldn't let Alan get in the way of that, okay?",
        "Phillip: Sounds like you're giving advice that you need to take.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Normally, I wouldn't care who my mom dates as long as she's happy. But Edmund? I mean, you should know. Your mom was married to him.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, and he hurt her, but, personally, Edmund was really great to me, especially when I was sick.",
        "Tammy: Well, you're the only person who feels that way about him. Last night, my mom had a her first real date with him, packed me and my brothers up and sent us to spend the night at Aunt Reva's. It was like she didn't want us around when they got back home. If you catch my drift.",
        "Lizzie: You don't think that... You know?",
        "Tammy: I hope not. I don't think so. One of the bellboys told me that the cops showed up around that same time.",
        "Lizzie: Why?",
        "Tammy: Something about questioning one of the guests. At any rate, Mom was dealing with them. So I doubt they had a chance to get very far, if anywhere. But I'm afraid it's only a matter of time.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, believe me, I hate that Olivia's with my dad, too. And don't think I haven't thought about doing something about it.",
        "Tammy: Doing what?",
        "Lizzie: But then I figure, maybe he'll just work it out for himself. I mean, Dad seems less enchanted with her everyday the more he sees her true colors. Maybe that will happen with your mom and Edmund.",
        "Tammy: You think?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, maybe we just sit back and relax... They'll end up screwing things up anyway. So did you get a prom dress?",
        "Tammy: Yeah, but I don't think I really like it. What about you?",
        "Lizzie: Same. You have a date, though?",
        "Tammy: No. You?",
        "Lizzie: I couple guys have asked me, but I'm not sure if I like them enough to say yes.",
        "Tammy: Really? What guys?",
        "Lizzie: Yes, really. Why do you seem so surprised?",
        "Tammy: I bet I know who you'd really like to ask you to the prom. Shayne.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, come on, Shayne. Please.",
        "Tammy: Oh, come on, like you don't have a thing for him.",
        "Lizzie: I don't. I did. But then I went away to boarding school and once I dated some guys there it just...",
        "Tammy: What guys? It was an all-girls' school?",
        "Lizzie: With an all-boys' school down the road. What's with you today? How come you all of a sudden don't believe me?",
        "Tammy: You want me to be honest?",
        "Lizzie: Not if you're going to be nasty about it, no.",
        "Tammy: Sometimes I think you sort of color the truth a little bit, Lizzie. I mean, embellish it or just sometimes plain lie.",
        "Lizzie: What about you? You're lying right now.",
        "Tammy: How?",
        "Lizzie: Pretending to be my friend, when obviously you're not.",
        "Tammy: Oh, come on, Lizzie, sit back down.",
        "Lizzie: Why? So you can beat up on me a little bit more?",
        "Tammy: I wasn't. Lizzie, you are my friend. And sometimes I see you acting like you're not hurt when I know you are. And I know what that's like, because I've done it so many times myself.",
        "Lizzie: I don't act like I'm not hurt. I already told how I'm upset about my dad and Olivia. I would have told you more. You just didn't want to hear it.",
        "Tammy: I wasn't talking about your parents. I was talking about Shayne. I know how much you like him.",
        "Lizzie: Liked him. I told you it's past tense.",
        "Tammy: So you have no more feelings for Shayne? None?",
        "Lizzie: Honestly, no, I don't. I mean, he's nice and, yeah, he's cute, but he's too much of a jock for me. Baseball's great. Don't get me wrong. But he needs to get a life.",
        "Tammy: So you're totally fine with him being so hot for Marina?",
        "Lizzie: No, it bothers me, but only because I know he could do a lot better.",
        "Tammy: With you?",
        "Lizzie: Better period. Quit twisting my words around.",
        "Tammy: Okay. Sorry.",
        "Lizzie: Jeez, you're as bad as the shrinks my parents are sending me to.",
        "Tammy: You're seeing a shrink?",
        "Lizzie: I know. Ridiculous, right? My parents are the ones who need to get their heads examined. They're the jerks that keep making the same dumb mistakes over and over again.",

        "Frank: All right, did I get here fast enough for you, big man?",
        "Rick: Hey, Frank. Thanks, pal. I really appreciate it. I just had to get away from the hospital just for a couple of minutes. I just thought, you know, I'd run around the park once and maybe clear my head.",
        "Frank: Clear your head. Okay, are you going to be able to clear your head and fill me in about Ariana at the same time?",
        "Rick: Frank, I don't want to talk about business, man. I just want to run. That's all I want to do. No business.",
        "Frank: Well, you know what, Rick? You're not going to be able to talk period after your run so... (Laughs)",
        "Rick: You know, if I wanted this abuse, I would have called Phillip. And by the way, I'm the best shape of my life right now. I'm running a 10k race tomorrow, by the way. Did you know that?",
        "Frank: You're running a 10k?",
        "Rick: That's right.",
        "Frank: Good for you.",
        "Rick: Yeah.",
        "Frank: Who would have thought that a year ago.",
        "Rick: Yeah, look at me now. Hey, look at us now, Frank. Big jobs we have. Big men around town, aren't we?",
        "Frank: Yep. Pretty crazy, isn't it? And all the responsibility.",
        "Rick: Frank, you're the most responsible person I know. I wouldn't worry about that. By the way, how's Marina doing?",
        "Frank: She's all right, man. She's hanging in there. Here, let me stretch. She's... she's been really going through a lot stuff lately, you know.",
        "Rick: Yeah, she's a Cooper. She'll be fine.",
        "Frank: Yeah, she sure is. (Laughs) You know, it's you that I'm worried about right now, though. Are you all right... Holding down two jobs and everything?",
        "Rick: I'm fine. No, I'm fine. I've never been better, Frank.",
        "Frank: Come on, Rick.",
        "Rick: I'm fried. I'm totally fried. I'm cooked. I haven't stopped since I took over this new job.",
        "Frank: See, I know that, man. You look very stressed to me. I'm worried about you. I mean, you're not taking it out on your beautiful wife, are you?",
        "Rick: No, I'm not. At least, I don't think I am. I'm not trying.",
        "Frank: Well, good.",
        "Rick: I never see my wife anymore, Frank. Never. I just... I take it out on my father. I've been such a jerk to him lately.",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, thank God I got my dad. He's been helping me out these days, so...",
        "Rick: Thanks, Frank. That makes me feel a lot better.",
        "Frank: Oh, come on. I didn't say it for that reason.",
        "Rick: Oh, no, this is stuff... Let's talk about what's going on with you. Some exciting things? I saw the new girl you're going out with. She's cute.",
        "Frank: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Rick: What's going on there?",
        "Frank: She's great, actually. Had a hell of a first date. I mean, nothing like a little murder before your entree.",
        "Rick: Yeah, I heard about that. You didn't have to pay for the dinner, did you?",
        "Frank: You're a piece of work, you know that? How did you ever get Mel to marry you?",
        "Rick: Frank, you've got to move real fast. You got to marry them before they know what hit them. Before they know anything about my demented personality. Go. I'll follow.",
        "Frank: No, you go ahead.",
        "Rick: You go.",
        "Frank: All right.",

        "Phillip: I love watching Zach when he's sleeping. Oh, boy, if life could be that simple again. Just thinking...",
        "Harley: What about?",
        "Phillip: This mess with Olivia. She has doubts about how much I care about her. She's feeling insecure.",
        "Harley: Phillip, she is so pregnant. Do you remember how I was? I mean, you're just a bundle of raging hormones.",
        "Phillip: No, but she has reasons to have doubts. I've been acting distant. I've been preoccupied.",
        "Harley: With Alan?",
        "Phillip: It's more than that. And it's Lizzie. She's got a lot going on right now.",
        "Harley: I'm sorry. What are you going to do about it?",
        "Gus: Hey. You guys having a little coffee klatch?",
        "Phillip: Something like that.",
        "Harley: I didn't expect you back so soon. (Phone rings)",
        "Gus: I left my notebook somewhere. Aitoro. Yes.",
        "Phillip: I'm going to take off. Listen, thanks for the coffee and thanks for listening.",
        "Gus: Well, why don't you prove to me you're worth this? Would you just listen to me? Yeah, Gavin Strong. The suspect from last night. Just find out if he's a diabetic for me. Thank you. Incompetence. See, it's right here.",
        "Harley: Did you get a big break on the case?",
        "Gus: Well, maybe I did. I don't know. Rick said that Ariana, the girl from last night, she was done in by a toxin that was injected by one of those one- shot deals that, you know, like a diabetic would use, you know?",
        "Harley: So if Gavin Strong is a diabetic then he would have access to those kinds of needles.",
        "Gus: Exactly. And as it turns out, Ramona Hendon, victim number three, she's a diabetic as well. Coincidence?",
        "Harley: Maybe. Not likely.",
        "Gus: What are you thinking?",
        "Harley: I'm thinking that Alan said Ariana was wearing a pin all night and that it disappeared. Most likely the killer took it, right?",
        "Gus: Yeah. So?",
        "Harley: So if there's another murder, I bet you I know what the weapon will be. So far, each murder has had some sort of connection to the one before it, right? I mean, besides the obvious connection that they all have to your sister's business.",
        "Gus: Go on.",
        "Harley: Murder victim number one was found, looked like a drowning, but it wasn't. Number two was found on dry land...",
        "Gus: ...But was indeed a drowning.",
        "Harley: Number three...",
        "Gus: Number three, looked like it was an electrocution, but it was also a drowning.",
        "Harley: Of a diabetic, right? Victim number four: She was poisoned with a diabetic syringe. Now this is all a very thin line, but stay with me. It doesn't seem quite so logical to us, anyway, but it looks like the killer is weaving the incidents together into some sort of pattern. Do you see it?",
        "Gus: Yes. And if the killer strikes again...",
        "Harley: ...I bet it's going to be with Ariana's pin. Ariana's pin is a sharp object, a syringe is a sharp object, you see?",
        "Gus: Yes. Yes.",
        "Harley: I mean it's just a theory.",
        "Gus: Well, it's more than I had a minute ago. I miss this, you know. I miss this partnership, hashing things out, trying to make sense of things together.",
        "Harley: I miss it, too. I miss the job. A lot.",
        "Gus: And that's why you did what you did. You had to get involved...",
        "Harley: ...In something that was absolutely none of my business. I mean that's... that's a small part of it, yeah. But the main reason was-- and Phillip actually said this to me and he was right-- Alan pushes all my buttons. And I think that usually I'm pretty good at hiding my insecurities, but Alan just seems to bring out the worst in me.",
        "Gus: Well, on that note...",
        "Harley: No, let me finish, because if I just don't say it I'm... I was wrong. I was so wrong what I did last night. I mean, besides interfering in your case, I was trying to come between you and Alan. I was trying to minimize his influence on you. And that is just meddling of the worst kind, because I didn't even let you into the equation. I didn't give you any credit. I didn't trust you to handle it. And I'm sorry. I'm really sorry about it. Because... because you told me over and over again that you could handle it. And now you must think that either I wasn't listening, I didn't care, or I didn't believe you-- none of which is true. I'm sorry. And I love you. And I wasn't doubting you. I was doubting myself. And I know that's not an excuse, but it's something. I mean, do you understand? Can you... Can you see what I'm saying even just a little... little bit?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I think we should just hang tight. I have the feeling our parents will be coming to their senses real soon. What's my dad doing here?",
        "Tammy: He probably came to see Olivia.",
        "Lizzie: I bet he's going to blast her for standing us up this morning. I'll see you later, okay? Hi, Dad. I thought you were going to see Zach?",
        "Phillip: Yeah, well, that the plan, but he was sound asleep. That's just as well. I need to speak to Olivia about something.",
        "Lizzie: Oh?",
        "Phillip: Yeah. Actually I need to talk to you about something, too.",
        "Lizzie: Okay.",

        "Olivia: What a nice surprise.",

        "Olivia: I was. I was, but things sort of sorted themselves out. So... I'm sorry I couldn't make breakfast. I know it was important to both of you.",
        "Phillip: That's okay. What are your plans for the next couple of days?",
        "Olivia: Plans?",
        "Phillip: Yeah, do have anything pressing here? Anything important scheduled?",
        "Olivia: I don't think so. Why?",

        "Josh: Wait a minute.",
        "Shayne: What?",
        "Josh: Just slow down for a minute, all right? Now that was an exaggeration. You do not hate baseball.",
        "Shayne: What? You're not exaggerating? You're not exaggerating?",
        "Josh: No.",
        "Shayne: I missed a couple of practices, and you're acting like I'm throwing away my career.",
        "Josh: Son, you're in a very important juncture in your career right now.",
        "Shayne: I know. I know that.",
        "Josh: And I'm just trying to look out for you.",
        "Shayne: No, you're only focusing on one thing, okay? I have a life, too. You know, I used to come home and you'd be like, \"Oh, son, how was school? How was your day?\" And now it's just, \"Oh, how was that fastball, son? How's the curveball coming along?\"",
        "Josh: Come on now. That's not fair. That's an exaggeration.",
        "Shayne: It's true. And also, you know where I was? The reason I missed practice, because I was up late night with Marina-- my friend who was just a little traumatized because she found two dead bodies in one day.",
        "Josh: Son...",
        "Shayne: Not to mention her boyfriend, her jerk of a boyfriend, broke up with her. But did you ask me how she is? No. You don't ask me. You just still talk about baseball.",
        "Josh: Look, I'm sorry.",
        "Shayne: You're like obsessed.",
        "Josh: Yeah, okay, maybe I am a little bit obsessed, but I think parents get obsessed about their kids. I think they want what's best for them. And you said this was what you wanted.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, I do. I do.",
        "Josh: It's not what I want. Do you want to play in the majors?",
        "Shayne: Yes, yes.",
        "Josh: Do you want to make it in the big league?",
        "Shayne: Yes, I do.",
        "Josh: Then how do you think that's going to happen? You think you're just gong to be sitting around on the couch and suddenly it's going to magically dropped in your lap, son? It's not going to work that way.",
        "Shayne: I know.",
        "Josh: You have to work and work hard...",
        "Shayne: I know that.",
        "Josh: ...Even when you don't feel like it. Even when there's some pretty young girl that needs a shoulder to cry on, you have to sacrifice.",
        "Shayne: I have been.",
        "Josh: You have to make a commitment and stick to that commitment.",
        "Shayne: I have been.",
        "Josh: And it's the difference between being a man and being a boy. So you're not going to miss any more practices, right? Shayne?",
        "Shayne: What? I'll try not to miss any more practices.",
        "Josh: You have to do better than try.",
        "Shayne: I said I'll try, okay? I'll try not to miss if I'm not too tired.",
        "Josh: Well, you won't be too tired. I promise you that. You will get plenty of sleep, because from now on, starting today, you're under curfew.",
        "Shayne: What?",
        "Josh: I'm sorry. You need a little help with discipline right now, and you have a curfew.",
        "Shayne: Oh, yeah? Okay, so what are you, my coach?",
        "Josh: No.",
        "Shayne: I'm sorry. I thought you were my dad.",

        "Josh: Don't even start with me.",
        "Reva: I'm not trying to start anything.",
        "Josh: Look, here's deal, all right. I had a little talk with Shayne, I told him some hard truths he didn't want to hear, he wasn't happy about it and that's it. End of story.",
        "Reva: What? Hard truths about missing baseball practice?",
        "Josh: Yeah. Well?",
        "Reva: Well, what?",
        "Josh: Well, don't you want to say, \"I told you so?\"",
        "Reva: No.",
        "Josh: I think you do. I think you do, because that helps you to continue to play the role of always being right.",
        "Reva: Well, I don't feel like the kind of person that is always right. I mean, I've made some pretty big mistakes very publicly.",
        "Josh: Yes, you have, but somehow you get through untouched, you know, unscathed. You glide through. You get a free ticket. It's okay for you to do the stuff you do, because you do it out of the passion that you have inside of you. You follow your passion. You follow your heart. But when I feel passionate about something, something relatively simple, like the future of our son, then I'm irrational. I'm overbearing.",
        "Reva: Maybe a little. And obviously it's...",

        "Harley: I do. I really do.",
