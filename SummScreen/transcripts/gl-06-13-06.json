        "Buzz: Frank, could you get coffee for table number four over there?",
        "Frank: Uh, yeah, sure. Where is everybody? You all by yourself?",
        "Buzz: Well, Lynn's at a wedding, Jamie's sick, Ava isn't on until this afternoon, and Coop's, he said he had stuff to do, whatever that means.",
        "Frank: Ah well, Lizzie's probably got him trying on tuxedos. ( Laughs )",
        "Buzz: Tuxedos?",
        "Frank: Yeah. What, you don't know? Of course you don't know. He didn't tell me either, so...",
        "Buzz: Know what, Frank?",
        "Frank: Coop and Lizzie are getting married. Ava saw them at the courthouse getting their license.",
        "Buzz: Here, cover for me.",
        "Frank: Where are you going?",
        "Buzz: Going to rescue my son.",

        "Lizzie: Did you tell nana about the shower?",
        "Beth: Shower?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I kind of convinced Tammy to put a little something together.",
        "Beth: Tammy?!",
        "Lizzie: This has to be a real wedding, Mom! I have to have a shower.",
        "Beth: Okay, okay, you're right. You're right. You deserve to have a shower, and it's very sweet of Tammy to do this. I just hope she doesn't bring that boyfriend of hers.",
        "Lizzie: No, no! Shh...",
        "Beth: Well, I'm sorry, honey. But he knows that he's the father of this baby. And that means he's a threat to your happiness.",
        "Lizzie: It is going to be fine. Once Coop and I are raising our child, everything will be perfect. Ooh, did you get a hold of the dove wrangler? I know it's a little short notice, but I have to have at least two dozen.",
        "Coop: Doves? Well, so much for a small, simple wedding, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Tammy? Coast is clear. You sure about this? We're going to do it?",
        "Reva: Yeah, kid, we're going to do it. I just... I want to take my pills first, though. Can you get me some water?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. So how many times a day do you have to take these?",
        "Reva: Twice. Twice daily, but it still doesn't keep the doctor away.",
        "Jonathan: What do all of those do?",
        "Reva: Well, this one... anti- nausea for the chemo. Others are vitamins and... well, this one. That one. But this isn't the hard part. This... this is the hard part.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: There. That's good, right? Right?",
        "Billy: Yeah, yeah. Josh, it looks fine.",
        "Josh: Yeah, but does the place look good enough to be on camera? That's the question.",
        "Billy: Come on, Josh. It's only \"Tulsa World.\" Grannies watch that show.",
        "Josh: Yeah, but see, Billy, here's the thing. Grannies, they're the ones that have all that money, you know? And we still need all the contributions we can get for the H.B. Lewis Center. So if this thing doesn't go well, that's going to be a bad thing for us.",
        "Billy: Josh, calm down. You've been on television before, you know this speech by heart. And besides that, you're going to have a bona fide TV star with Reva Lewis Shayne sitting right next to you. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Josh: Hello?",
        "Reva: Hi, it's me.",

        "Reva: I'm sorry, I... I can't make it.",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Reva: Jonathan needs my help.",
        "Josh: Reva...",
        "Reva: It's important. I'm sorry.",
        "Josh: Yeah, well, so is this, sweetheart.",
        "Reva: Cassie can sit in for me.",
        "Josh: No, Reva, you can't push this off on Cassie.",
        "Reva: Well, sweetie, she knows more about the project than I do anyway.",
        "Josh: Yeah, but she doesn't have the history that you do with H.B. That's the whole point of this.",
        "Reva: I will definitely make this up to you. I promise. ( Sighs )",
        "Jonathan: How many times can you do that?",
        "Reva: Too many times already. But this time I think I really let him down.",
        "Jonathan: Hey. Call him back, go over there...",
        "Reva: I can't. He has to do this interview, and... I have to do this before I lose my nerve. I've been looking at my skull, trying to see if I have any weird lumps or bumps or splotchy birth marks or anything.",
        "Jonathan: Well, I think you've got a good head.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) I think that's probably the nicest thing you've ever said to me.",
        "Jonathan: We don't have to do this.",
        "Reva: Yes, yes. We do, because I'm already losing clumps of hair. You know, I cut it once to try to hide it, but...",
        "Jonathan: You sure?",
        "Reva: It's going to grow back. You know, it will. Quickly. So turn that puppy on. ( Cell phone ringing )",
        "Jonathan: That's Tammy. I'll just call her back later.",
        "Reva: No, no, no, no. Take the call. I need a few minutes to run my fingers through my golden locks.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, what's up?",
        "Tammy: I'm at a bridal/baby shower. No, scratch that. I'm giving a bridal/baby shower.",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie?",
        "Tammy: Who else?",
        "Jonathan: So. Coop's going to marry Lizzie, that's... that's good. That's definitely good for the baby.",
        "Tammy: Listen, I know we were going to do lunch, but that was before.",
        "Jonathan: No, it's okay. I have, um, something else I need to do too, so... okay, I love you, too. Bye.",
        "Reva: You're going to let Coop marry Lizzie?",
        "Jonathan: Better him than me.",
        "Reva: Jonathan, you keeping quiet about this...",
        "Jonathan: Reva. Not now, okay? Come on.",
        "Reva: Okay.",
        "Jonathan: Are you ready?",
        "Reva: Yeah. Yeah, I am. I... think I need a drink first, though.",
        "Jonathan: Are you supposed to drink?",
        "Reva: No... well... no. But...",
        "Jonathan: Then I'm not going to let you drink.",
        "Reva: You know what? One of us has to be drunk. Or you're going to have to drink for me, because if I'm going all cue-ball, then... one of us has to be drunk.",

        "Beth: Henry! Hello! Champagne?",
        "Coop: No, thank you.",
        "Beth: Well, then I guess I'll just have to settle for a hug. Welcome to the family.",
        "Coop: Thank you very much, Beth.",
        "Beth: And don't be too hard on Lizzie. She's just trying to make this a special day.",
        "Coop: I... know she is. But Lizzie? I thought we agreed that we weren't going to get too... crazy here.",
        "Lizzie: That doesn't mean it can't be beautiful.",
        "Coop: Uh-huh. Right. Can I take a look at that, please?",
        "Beth: Sure. Yeah.",
        "Coop: Thank you. A horse-drawn carriage?",
        "Lizzie: That's just for me and mom.",

        "Lizzie: No, but...",
        "Coop: Oh. This should be fun.",
        "Beth: Let me speak to him first. Hello, darling.",
        "Alan: Darling? This is never a good sign. What's going on here?",
        "Beth: Going on?",
        "Alan: Yes, I thought it was going to be the three of us for lunch.",
        "Beth: I lied. Alan, Alan, come on. Be a sport. Lizzie and Coop have something wonderful to tell us.",
        "Alan: Really? That he's not the father of her baby?",
        "Beth: That's really not very nice.",
        "Alan: I can dream, can't I?",
        "Beth: Alan. Come on. Just... think. Think how grateful I would be if you were just happy for Lizzie and you didn't interfere at all. Hmm? Come on. Smiles, Alan. Smiles.",
        "Lizzie: Granddad! I'm so glad that you could make it.",
        "Alan: ( Laughs ) Well, I... your mother told me it was going to be the three of us for lunch.",
        "Lizzie: Well, it's going to be lunch, and a whole lot more. Henry and I are getting married. This week! ( Laughs )",
        "Alan: Absolutely not!",
        "Buzz: Well, hell has actually frozen over. Alan is right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Am I late?",
        "Josh: No! No, actually, you're just on time. Glad to see you. Come on down. Um... I need you to... fill in for Reva.",
        "Cassie: Oh, not again. Where is she now?",
        "Josh: You know what? It... doesn't matter. It's not important. What do you say?",
        "Cassie: Well, I say I'm just here to watch. You and Reva are the faces of this project.",
        "Josh: Yeah, I know that. That was sort of my concept for this thing, too, but Reva as usual had other plans, so... will you help me out, please?",
        "Cassie: Uh... you know, I don't think I'm appropriately dressed, actually.",
        "Josh: What are you talking about? You look amazing. As usual, what a surprise. Billy, tell her she looks amazing...",
        "Billy: Oh! Wow, you... you look wonderful.",
        "Cassie: Billy, what about you? Come on, I mean H.B.'s sons finishing his work together. It's perfect!",
        "Billy: I don't want to show Josh up on television. I'm too tall.",
        "Josh: Okay, all right. You know what? Never mind. I can do it myself, it's not a problem.",
        "Cassie: Or you could just reschedule until Reva's available.",
        "Josh: No, actually, I can't, because the reporter's already on her way.",
        "Cassie: Or do it on your own. You don't need us. You really don't. You're going to be fine.",
        "Josh: Cassie...",
        "Billy: Just out of curiosity, why's Reva not coming this time?",
        "Josh: It... it's not important.",
        "Billy: Well, I'm just trying to point out a pattern. I mean, she didn't make it for the groundbreaking, now she's not going to be here today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Hey!",
        "Reva: Mm. Look, the only reason you're here is because I knew you wouldn't lecture me.",
        "Jonathan: Fine, but that's... enough.",
        "Reva: Okay. You know, I can remember when I was born. I mean, I don't remember it, but mama used to tell me that I had this beautiful head of blonde hair like she'd never, ever seen before. Born to be bad, I guess.",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs )",
        "Reva: And pop. You know, pop knew by the time I was four that I was going to be trouble and that he was going to be in trouble. You know, because I used to do that hair-flip thing over my shoulder whenever those Lewis boys were around. The power of that hair flip... ( laughs ) ...turned those boys into jelly when I was younger. And the '80s, oh man... you're lucky you weren't around for the '80s, because the '80s was the time of the big hair, you know. I had such a hairdo. Well, actually, it was more like a... more like a hair- don't. ( Laughs ) Teased really high. So you think I have a good head?",
        "Jonathan: ( Sighs ) No doubt.",
        "Reva: Okay. Crank that puppy up. ( Sound of clippers )",
        "Reva: Wait! ( Laughs ) you know what? I don't like the sound of that. Turn up the tunes, and turn them up really loud. (Laughs) ( rock music playing ) ( sound of clippers )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Buzz, please don't ruin this day.",
        "Buzz: When were you going to tell me?",
        "Coop: Uh, later. Right after we...",
        "Lizzie: Look, please don't blame Coop. I just wanted to tell granddad first.",
        "Buzz: Oh, you wanted to get the worst part over with first. I'd be the easy one, right? Just because I embrace her and the child, what do you think I think of the marriage? I don't like it any more than he does. Are you just going to leave me here by myself, or are you going to help me out here?",
        "Alan: Buzz, I think you know that Henry would not be my first choice for my granddaughter. But if... she chooses him, then I'm not going to stand in their way.",
        "Lizzie: Thank you.",
        "Alan: ( Laughs )",
        "Lizzie: I love you.",
        "Alan: And I love you too, sweetheart. Now I expect you to treat her like the princess she is.",
        "Coop: I will do my best.",
        "Alan: Well, see that you do.",
        "Buzz: Are you nuts?!",
        "Coop: Pop, please. Let it go, okay?",
        "Buzz: Please, I made the same mistake myself and ruined people's lives. I don't want to see you do the same thing.",
        "Lizzie: Coop is not making a mistake. We love each other and we're doing the best thing for our child. Why can't you just be happy for us?",
        "Coop: Lizzie, please, look... just let it go, okay? He will, in time. Just give him some time, that's it.",
        "Beth: You know, speaking of time, we need to get going for your shower, hmm?",
        "Lizzie: Talk to you later?",
        "Coop: Yeah. Have fun.",
        "Buzz: They're going to give her a shower?",
        "Alan: Yes, Buzz, it's a tradition. And I think your son deserves the same consideration.",
        "Coop: What? A shower?",
        "Alan: I believe they call it a bachelor party, and your father is going to be the host. A toast to the baby that Elizabeth is carrying, and... to the future.",
        "Crowd: To Lizzie and Coop! ( Laughs )",
        "Buzz: Alan, that toast, uh... the toast, you didn't include Lizzie or Coop. Just about the baby.",
        "Alan: The baby is what all of this is about, Buzz.",
        "Coop: Do you guys mind? I mean, this is supposed to be my bachelor party, right?",
        "Frank: Yeah, Coop's right. You know? We should be showing him a good time here, so...",
        "Alan: I agree, I agree. Listen, does anyone remember the bar that Cassie Winslow used to work in, in Chicago?",
        "Frank: That's not exactly what we had in mind, Alan.",
        "Buzz: You know, why doesn't this happen. Why don't we just sit around here and figure out all the reasons this wedding should not happen?",
        "Alan: Buzz, could I have a word with you for a minute? ( Quietly ) You keep this up and you're going to blow it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Well, if there's anything I can do to sabotage the wedding, let me know.",
        "Alexandra: ( Laughs ) I think there's not a thing you can do, dear. It's already done.",
        "Marina: Are you kidding me? The big, bad Alexandra is giving up?",

        "Lizzie: Thank you for all of this.",
        "Tammy: Does that mean you're having a nice time?",
        "Lizzie: Of course, I'm having a great time. You know, Coop may not believe this, but I can do simple if I have to. Here is the proof.",
        "Tammy: Well, it's great to see you so happy.",
        "Lizzie: It's great to be happy. Oh, Tammy, we are getting everything we want.",

        "Jonathan: Stop.",
        "Reva: And you're bringing a new, little life into this world.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, it's a real riot.",
        "Reva: Oh, I don't... I don't mean about me dying. I mean, that's... that's not going to happen. There's no chance of that. And all of this secrecy, you know, keeping this whole thing from the world and from Josh, is just because... well, it's because I'm going to get better. It's really not too bad.",
        "Jonathan: You scared?",
        "Reva: Actually, I'm terrified. But I just... live my life, you know? That's what I have to do. I mean, I'm only scared when I stop to think. But if I just live my life and know that I'm doing this for the kids, for Josh, and that new little grandbaby of mine.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. You don't know when to stop.",
        "Reva: Yeah, I know, it comes in handy sometimes. Jonathan, you saw your little girl.",
        "Jonathan: Reva, cut it out.",
        "Reva: Come on, you saw her heartbeat.",
        "Jonathan: I don't know what I saw.",
        "Reva: It's your daughter, sweetie. It is. It's a baby that you helped create. You can't tell me that that doesn't get to you.",
        "Jonathan: All right, it got to me, but it doesn't matter, because I'm not going to do anything about it.",
        "Reva: The bond between a father and his daughter can be very strong.",
        "Jonathan: Tell it to Coop.",
        "Reva: I've got something for you.",
        "Jonathan: ( Sighs )",
        "Reva: I've gotten pretty good at sneaking around the hospital.",
        "Jonathan: What am I supposed to say?",
        "Reva: I just thought you'd like to have it. Thank you.",
        "Jonathan: Of course. You look good.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Well, now, darling. From me.",
        "Lizzie: Auntie Alex, is it what I think it is?",
        "Alexandra: You're going to have to open it and find out, aren't you?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, I have wanted these since I was a little girl.",
        "Alexandra: Well, now you have them, darling. You can pass them on to your little girl.",
        "Lizzie: Aren't they beautiful?",
        "Alexandra: They were my mother's.",
        "Lizzie: Thank you.",
        "Alexandra: You're welcome, darling.",
        "Lizzie: I think I'm going to wear these in the wedding. Wouldn't they be perfect with my dress?",
        "Tammy: I don't know about everybody else, but I'm starving. So let's have cake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Mom, I want to thank you for making this such a special day. It wasn't too difficult, was it?",
        "Lillian: Well, of course not. I mean, I certainly want the exact same thing you want. I want Lizzie to be happy forever, have a wonderful life with a man who loves her.",
        "Beth: You see? We do want the same thing.",
        "Lillian: Do you think Coop loves her?",
        "Beth: Oh, mom, please.",
        "Lillian: ( Laughs ) Honey? I have been sitting here having an incredible sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and finally it hit me.",
        "Beth: Okay, I'll bite. What hit you?",
        "Lillian: We've been here before. You've been here before. You were about Lizzie's age, but someone else was playing Lizzie's part. Mindy. She was madly in love with the boy who wasn't in love with her, she got pregnant, he-- Phillip-- felt obligated to marry her. Is this ringing some bells?",
        "Beth: Okay, okay, that's enough. Maybe you don't understand how important this is to Lizzie, but I do. How important this is to all of us. No one is going to hurt another one of my children.",
        "Lillian: Is this about your baby?",
        "Beth: No one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Don't get any ideas, Alan.",
        "Alan: Oh, come on, Frank. Every bachelor party ought to have a girl that pops out of a cake. You got a cake in the back, Buzz?",
        "Frank: Seeing Ava right now is about the last thing that Coop needs, okay? I mean... oh. Oh, I know what you're doing. That's a pretty shrewd plan.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, I wish I'd have thought of it.",
        "Frank: Isn't it a little late for your games here, Alan?",
        "Alan: No, not at all. You see, Frank, I have a knack at calling situations like this.",
        "Frank: So if Coop just happens to call off the wedding, you could just stand there and let Lizzie hurt like that?",
        "Alan: If I had to. But I'll tell you one thing: Her baby will never be hurt. Because if she is, there will be hell to pay.",
        "Buzz: Hey.",
        "Coop: What... what are these?",
        "Buzz: I figured you could use them. Your mom gave them to me. Said that I should... remember how much I loved her every time I wore them. That was your mother.",
        "Coop: The tux that Lizzie got me already has cufflinks.",
        "Buzz: Exactly. You don't love her.",
        "Coop: ( Sighs ) The tux that Lizzie got me is nice. I've got to get some air.",
        "Buzz: Coop, Coop, come on. You can be a good father without handing your life over. Is this what you want for yourself?",
        "Coop: Dad, stop, all right? Enough. Please. I mean, you're acting like I'm some dead man walking here. All right? Yes, this is what I want. And no, no one is pressuring me into this. Lizzie and I don't have what you and mom had right now, but... we've got time, all right? We've got time. I need to get some air. I just...",
        "Ava: No offense, but your bachelor party seems a little lame.",
        "Coop: ( Laughs ) How dare you? That Alan is a fun guy.",
        "Ava: Fun guy?",
        "Coop: Yes, he's a fun guy.",
        "Ava: ( Laughs ) Like a mushroom or something.",
        "Coop: Sort of.",
        "Ava: So, you're getting married.",
        "Coop: Yep. That's what they tell me. Which means tonight is my last night of freedom.",
        "Ava: It would be so easy to be selfish right now.",
        "Coop: Yeah. To do what just feels right in the moment. Like the other night in your room.",
        "Ava: I was a different person, like Olivia or Lizzie, I would grab you and push you up against the wall and kiss you.",
        "Coop: Hey, now.",
        "Ava: And beg you... beg you not to go through with it. Maybe if I was that girl, you... ( sighs ) ...you would call it off, the wedding.",
        "Coop: Maybe.",
        "Ava: But I'm not that girl. And you couldn't walk away from something that you felt you had to do. Even if I asked you to.",
        "Coop: You wouldn't ask. And that's why. ( Sighs ) Good-bye, Ava.",
        "Ava: Hey, wait a minute. What about your party?",
        "Coop: The party is over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: If anyone tries to get in your way, whether it's your grandfather, or Jonathan...",
        "Lizzie: Look around, Mom. Look around. Nobody is trying to get in the way. Everyone is so happy for me.",
        "Beth: You're right, of course. You... you just marry the man that you love, and you have a happy life together.",
        "Marina: Punch, ladies?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, thank God, could I use a drink.",
        "Jonathan: What the hell is wrong with you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I never knew H.B., actually, but I know Josh Lewis. And I can tell you that he is an amazing, wonderful man who is going to make his father very proud with this project.",
        "Josh: Wow. It's not like I'm doing this on my own, though, of course.",
        "Cassie: You are the heart and soul of this thing.",
        "Reporter: Now, H.B. Lewis. Founder of Lewis oil. A lot of people said no to him. They said it couldn't be done.",
        "Josh: Hey, you know what, my father never took no for an answer from anybody. The fact is, he ran out of time. That's it. I, fortunately, have time.",
        "Cassie: Not to mention the talent and the vision...",
        "Josh: ( Laughs ) I pay her a lot of money.",
        "Reporter: So it has been a struggle, though?",
        "Josh: Pretty much every step of the way, yes.",
        "Cassie: But you fought through it. I mean... and that's another wonderful thing about this man, is that he is a fighter. He never gives up. I mean, you are as much of a hero as the people you're looking to help. I'm just very... I'm very proud to know him.",
        "Reporter: Wow. Your sister-in-law's a big fan.",
        "Josh: Well, I'm a big fan of hers, so...",
        "Billy: It's just a big old family love-fest.",
        "Josh: ( Laughs ) Yeah, well, the fact is, this is a family project, that's true, and that's what makes it so special. But we need outside help, still. So if you're thinking about making a donation out there, if you do that, you'll make it onto my list of heroes, and I will thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: How am I going to pull this off?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Well, it's obvious that your son is in love with that girl out there, Buzz.",
        "Buzz: He feels obliged to marry Lizzie. I don't know, maybe we're wrong. Maybe we can't win this one.",
        "Alan: This wedding shouldn't happen. Elizabeth's going to be hurt.",
        "Buzz: She won't be the only one.",
        "Alan: Well, it ain't over yet.",
        "Buzz: Well, what are you going to do?",
        "Alan: I don't know, but I have a feeling you're not going to stand in my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Oh, boy. Pretty rough day, huh? You know, Marina was in the same type of situation not too long ago.",
        "Ava: With Danny?",
        "Frank: You know about it, huh?",
        "Ava: He broke her heart. You know, the most frustrating thing for me about this whole situation is watching Coop settle. He deserves so much more.",
        "Frank: Yeah, but you know what? Ava, so do you. You're a great girl. No, you are, seriously. And you know what, you really deserve to have a good life, don't you? I mean, come on. And if it, you know, turns out that you're not with Coop, I'm sorry to say that it's his loss. Trust me. There's really someone else out there for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: What goes on in your head? Why would you drink?!",
        "Lizzie: It was just punch!",
        "Tammy: There wasn't alcohol in there.",
        "Lizzie: What are you even doing here? Get out!",
        "Coop: Hey! What's going on?",
        "Lizzie: He's crazy! Get him out of here.",

        "Beth: Marina, you're a police officer. Arrest him for disorderly conduct. Do something.",
        "Tammy: Stop, no! Okay, we'll leave. He was just trying to help. Weren't you? We're leaving. Sorry. Excuse me. What was that about?",
        "Jonathan: I just came here to get you. I'm sorry. I had a bad day.",
        "Tammy: Let's go home, okay?",
        "Jonathan: Okay.",
        "Tammy: You can tell me about it later.",

        "Josh: Thank you very much. ( Door shuts ) Wow! What... ( laughs ) Wait, wait, okay, let me start again. Thank you very much. ( Door shuts ) Hi there. What's your name?",
        "Reva: ( Fake accent ) My name is... Carlotta.",
        "Josh: Carlotta. I like that.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) I know, I know, I just feel very bad that...",
        "Josh: Shh, shah, shah. Don't speak, don't speak. See, I don't want to waste any time talking because my wife could walk in that door any minute. She was supposed to be here for an interview.",
        "Reva: Oh, yes, I know, she told me that she was running late, but she also said that Cassie filled in, right?",
        "Josh: Yes, she did. She was fine, but tell me, tell me some more about Carlotta.",
        "Reva: Oh, well. Carlotta is starving.",
        "Josh: What a coincidence. Joshua is starving as well.",
        "Reva: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Carlotta is starving for food. Steaks on the grill, fire it up. ( Laughs )",
        "Josh: Okay. Anything for Carlotta.",
        "Reva: Love you.",
        "Josh: Love you, too.",
        "Reva: Bud, you keep wanting me to tell you what's been wrong with me. Well, there is something that I've been keeping from you. No. I won't do that to you.",

        "This is more than I could have asked for. Josh, I'm proud of you.",
        "Josh: You know how it is, you and somebody have that sense of helplessness because you have no hope of ever getting them back again.",
