        "Alex was revealed as the Spalding connection but blamed Brad Green for threatening to expose her, as the reason she was still involved in the drug trade. She told Gus it was her word against his when Alan stepped from the shadows of the cellar and pleaded with Gus not to arrest Alex. Gus couldn't believe what he was hearing and of course refused. During the time they were arguing, an impatient Brad Green showed up to pick up the money, implicating him and enabling Gus to keep Alex's involvement a secret should he choose to. (they were all hidden of course) Brad headed upstairs where Harley and the feds were waiting to arrest him. Gus told Alan that Brad would rat Alex out and was probably spilling the beans to Harley right now when... he got word from Harley over the intermittent earpieces that Brad had dropped dead of a heart attack - leaving Gus with an interesting choice regarding Alex.",
        "Lizzie consoled both Joey and Tammy (different times of the evening). Once alone in their room, Phillip showed Olivia a receipt, signed by her from the boutique where her dress was bought. Danny captured Salerno, after a few tense moments. He'd knocked Danny out and kidnapped Reva, who later turned on him and demanded he shoot her or stop threatening her."

        "Jeffrey: How are you holding up? It's Banfield, right?",
        "Agent #1: Yes, sir.",
        "Jeffrey: Where do we stand?",
        "Agent #1: The perimeter has been established. My team is standing by. We'll move in and take Salerno down on your \"go.\"",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, I'm afraid there's a little change in the situation.",
        "Agent #1: What's the problem?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, my guy in there has informed me that there's a little extra company, some unexpected company-- a civilian.",
        "Agent #1: A civilian.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. Her name is Reva Lewis. So our main priority now is going to be to get them both out of there before the fireworks start.",
        "Agent #1: Yes, sir.",
        "Jeffrey: I just hope to god we can do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Salerno: Give me the bag, Danny.",
        "Danny: Vinnie, why don't we let Reva get out of here first?",
        "Reva: No problem.",
        "Salerno: Sit down!",
        "Reva: Well, no. You two have business. Obviously it's important. I'll just be on my way.",
        "Salerno: I said sit down.",
        "Danny: Vinnie, we do have business to discuss, and I think it should be done in private.",
        "Salerno: Isn't this private enough?",
        "Danny: Why don't we let Reva get out of here?",
        "Salerno: I'm not through with her yet.",
        "Danny: What are you talking about? Are you telling me that she is more important to you than what is in this bag? This is the shipment that you've been waiting for, from San Cristobel. I don't think anybody should see me handing it over to you.",
        "Salerno: Why don't you let me decide that?",
        "Danny: Vinnie, I think we need to keep this neat.",
        "Salerno: Listen, I don't really care what you think, all right? If this bothers you so much, leave the bag and get out. You hear what I said?",
        "Danny: You didn't hear what I said. I said Reva leaves, now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: It's you. So you're the pipeline of antimonious to the mob.",
        "Alexandra: Gus, you don't know...",
        "Gus: I have been down here for four hours, sitting down here in the dark, waiting to see who was going to come down and get this case, hoping to god it wasn't a family member, a Spaulding. Maybe it was Brad Green, and at the end of the day, we could all put the blame on him. But you?",
        "Alexandra: Gus, let me... just listen to me.",
        "Gus: What? Listen to you what? Explain how it's okay to sell drugs to the mob? Or how it's okay to betray your own family, or the entire community for that matter? Kids on the street are doing delirium. That's what this stuff is. These kids are Lizzie's age. These kids are going into the hospital, and a lot of them aren't coming out!",
        "Alexandra: I want to explain this to you. Just...",
        "Gus: I would like to hear you explain this to Alan!",
        "Alexandra: No. Alan can't know. Gus, you can't tell anyone.",
        "Gus: Yeah, Cooper?",
        "Harley: I've been trying to raise you for ten minutes. My radio is acting up, now of all times. Can you believe it?",
        "Gus: Where are you?",
        "Harley: I am upstairs, still looking for Brad. He hasn't left yet, not for good. He still needs his money. How are things going down there?",
        "Gus: What's going on down here? Is that what you said?",
        "Harley: That's what I said. Am I breaking up again?",
        "Gus: No, coop, I hear you loud and clear. There's a lot going on down here in the old wine cellar.",
        "Harley: Really? How so? There's Brad. Listen, I don't want to risk losing him again. Let me get back to you when I have a better idea of what's going on. Copy that?",
        "Gus: Cooper, are you there? (Static)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Stupid radio. I'm not worrying about this right now. Looking mighty nervous there, Casanova. What are you waiting for? The cash is downstairs. Why don't you get it?",
        "Phillip: Harley. Harley. Hey.",
        "Harley: Hey.",
        "Phillip: It's been ages.",
        "Harley: At least an hour.",
        "Phillip: It's a nice event, isn't it?",
        "Harley: Has been, yeah. Are you guys on your way home?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Yes, we are. It's late.",
        "Phillip: Oh, but it's not that late. Harley, I want you to take a look at my beautiful bride here.",
        "Harley: (Laughs)",
        "Phillip: Can you believe this dress?",
        "Harley: That dress is a real eye-opener, I'll tell you that.",
        "Phillip: Hey. Who you looking for? Gus?",
        "Harley: No. No, I'm not looking for anybody. And actually, I'd love to stay in here and chat with you guys, but I am kind of...",
        "Phillip: Busy? At a party, you're busy?",
        "Harley: I take my parties very seriously.",
        "Olivia: Phillip, we should go.",
        "Phillip: I don't want to go. I'm getting such a kick out of showing you off like this. It doesn't happen very often. Now, really, tell me: Isn't she something?",
        "Harley: (Laughs) yeah, she is something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Cooper! Cooper!",
        "Alexandra: Look, Gus, forget Harley for now.",
        "Gus: Why is that? So this can be our dirty little secret?",
        "Alexandra: Gus, we have to talk before you do something we will both regret.",
        "Gus: Oh, I'm not going to regret anything, Aunt Alex, not at all. I'm just going to hand you over to the D.A so he can prosecute you for trafficking drugs, okay?",
        "Alexandra: You don't want to send your own aunt to prison, Gus.",
        "Gus: My own aunt?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, come on.",
        "Gus: My own aunt is a drug dealer. That's disgusting to me. You've had an... this is an all- time low for you. I've got no problems sending you to prison, do you understand me?",
        "Alexandra: For what?",
        "Gus: You've got to be kidding me, right?",
        "Alexandra: No. No, I come down here looking for a bottle of wine. You bust out at me, shove a gun in my face, accuse me of all sorts of incredible things. The whole thing's rather outrageous, isn't it?",
        "Gus: No, you came down here to pick up this case. This isn't a bottle of wine.",
        "Alexandra: Exactly. It's a briefcase, sitting out here ominously in the middle of nothing. Wouldn't I be curious? And as a matter of fact, you're mistaken. I did not pick it up.",
        "Gus: Is that right?",
        "Alexandra: You're a policeman, Gus. You know people remember things differently. And it's your word against mine, isn't it?",
        "Gus: Alexandra, I know what I saw.",
        "Alexandra: Really? And do you have a shred of proof?",
        "Alan: Oh, yes, he does. I'm right here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Agent #1: Sir, I let my men know the target's not alone in the building. They're repositioning.",
        "Jeffrey: Make sure that they stay out of sight, would you, please? If Salerno catches wind of what we're up to here, my guy and Reva Lewis could be dead. (Salerno's voice over earpiece) hang on. (Danny's voice over earpiece) what are you up to, Santos?",
        "Danny: I really need you to hear what I'm saying and trust my judgment.",
        "Salerno: The lady is no threat.",
        "Danny: How do you know that? Reva may be a psychic, but she's also a journalist with her own TV show. You really want her to make you her next big story?",
        "Reva: Well, you don't have to worry about that, because I haven't really seen or heard anything.",
        "Danny: Right-- yet.",
        "Reva: There's no reason it can't stay that way. I'll leave, and you two do whatever it is you do.",
        "Danny: Good. Go.",
        "Salerno: You stay put. You give me the bag.",
        "Danny: Vinnie? My job is to watch your back. That's all I'm trying to do.",
        "Salerno: Why don't you take five with that, huh?",
        "Danny: I'm not going to take five. You and I have business to deal with, and Reva is not a part of it.",
        "Reva: You're right. I'm not. I'm not even interested in what you do here, so I'll just walk out that door and forget I was ever even here.",
        "Danny: See, vinnie, she's not stupid. Come on, let her get out of here.",
        "Salerno: You got some stones, you know that, Danny? Nobody talks... this is a setup.",
        "Danny: What? What do you mean?",
        "Salerno: Do you know anything about this?",
        "Reva: No. Nothing. Really. I swear.",
        "Salerno: Somebody set me up.",
        "Jeffrey: He made us. Salerno made us. He saw your snipers. So much for repositioning.",
        "Agent #1: I'm sorry, sir.",
        "Jeffrey: You're sorry? We could have a couple of corpses on the floor in there. You're sorry? All right. We're going to have to make our move now. Things are escalating too fast. It doesn't matter who's going to get hurt, we're going to have to make a move.",
        "Salerno: You know who did this.",
        "Danny: What are you talking about, vinnie? I have no idea.",
        "Salerno: It was somebody who knew what was happening tonight, all right? Somebody that wanted us both to go down. Dirty, lousy...",
        "Danny: All right, vinnie, calm down. Just take it easy.",
        "Salerno: Are you kidding me? With those cops out there? Didn't you see them surrounding the place?",
        "Reva: I had an image of something, but I wasn't sure what the connection was. I'm sorry.",
        "Salerno: A lot good that does me.",
        "Reva: No, you know what? I may still be able to help you out here, though.",
        "Salerno: How?",
        "Reva: By buying some time.",
        "Danny: She's right. Vinnie, the cops have got to know that she's in here. We need to let her go, first.",
        "Salerno: Too late for that.",
        "Danny: No, Vinnie.",
        "Salerno: If I'm going down, I'm taking as many of them with me as I can.",
        "Danny: Vinnie, you're not thinking. Listen to me. This is what we need to do. The cops are going to want us to turn ourselves in, so the first thing we do is we let Reva go. We send her out, alone, as a gesture of goodwill, and that'll give us time to figure out what we need to do.",
        "Salerno: Maybe you're right. How do we handle this? Do we send her out the back or the front?",
        "Reva: I'm not fussy.",
        "Danny: She has to go out the front so the cops know that we're letting her go. Otherwise it'll look like she escaped.",
        "Salerno: Yeah. That's a good idea.",
        "Danny: Right. Now, everybody needs to stay away from the windows.",
        "Salerno: Did you see that coming?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Alan, how long have you been down here?",
        "Alan: Long enough to confirm my suspicions, Alexandra. So, my sister, selling drugs-- Spaulding drugs-- to the mob. It doesn't get worse than that.",
        "Gus: I really didn't want to believe that it would be anybody in our family.",
        "Alan: Neither did I, Gus, but it's become painfully clear to me the past couple of months what Alexandra's been up to.",
        "Gus: Excuse me. You have known about this for a couple of months?",
        "Alan: I knew that Brad Green could not have pulled off something on this scale alone. He had to have other resources-- resources very high up to make things run smoothly, and also to cover his tracks.",
        "Gus: Somebody like her.",
        "Alan: I knew it wasn't me, so it had to be her.",
        "Alexandra: All right, Alan, there's a lot...",
        "Alan: So I have had my sister followed day and night, and her calls monitored.",
        "Gus: Al, that's against the law.",
        "Alan: The authorities may have to play by the law, but I don't. Tell me something. Why would you do something like this? You don't need this money. Was it the thrill of destroying the youth of this city?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, for god's sake. Alan, stop it! I am not a monster!",
        "Gus: Could have fooled me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: You know, I still can't quite believe that I'm actually married to this woman. She's like some goddess. Isn't she?",
        "Olivia: We should go. Harley said she's busy.",
        "Phillip: Oh, I don't see her running off anywhere.",
        "Harley: No, but I just might, any second.",
        "Phillip: You know, I don't remember you ever having a dress like this.",
        "Olivia: Enough with the dress.",
        "Phillip: Did you? Harley? Did you ever...",
        "Harley: Have a dress like this?",
        "Phillip: Yeah.",
        "Harley: No. If I had a dress like that, it would certainly be seared in my memory.",
        "Phillip: Well, it made quite a splash here tonight.",
        "Harley: I assume that was the idea.",
        "Olivia: It was a gift from Phillip.",
        "Harley: The idea to make a splash?",
        "Olivia: No, the dress.",
        "Harley: Oh.",
        "Olivia: And you'd think he'd know better than to fish for compliments from every soul in the place.",
        "Phillip: I can't help it. Just... you're just such a sight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: You know, this whole time I knew that Tammy didn't think I was good enough for her.",
        "Lizzie: Well, I don't think it's exactly that. I just... I think a lot of girls start falling for older guys. And here's Edmund, this cultured and gorgeous guy, and he's being nice to her, and just... she fell for it.",
        "Joey: Yeah, well, I should have just broken up with her when I thought she was trying to change me. But I thought it would just stop, that it was just something that was just going on but it didn't. And then she pushed me to do all the Shakespeare stuff and... (Sighs)",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, but you really were a great Romeo.",
        "Joey: Buying me the same presents that she bought for Edmund. I mean, I would never do anything like that to her. I cared about her too much-- or whoever I thought she was.",
        "Lizzie: I really don't get why Tammy would ever want to change you. I mean, here you are, this big baseball star, and almost every girl in high school liked you at one point or another, and they would be happy to have you just the way you are.",
        "Joey: Yeah. Well, I used to think that, but now I don't know.",
        "Lizzie: She's shaking your confidence. That's not good. Listen, my grandmother is a nurse, and she says chocolate does have medicinal value. Come on. (Laughs) see? Now, that's better, isn't it?",
        "Joey: Yeah. You crack me up.",
        "Lizzie: See? Isn't that better than sitting at home with your mom all night?",
        "Joey: Yeah, I guess. You know, I really don't know what I would have done without you tonight. I don't know who else to talk to. Sandy and Shayne are Tammy's cousins, and I can't exactly talk to them about her and Edmund. And no matter what she's done to me, it still wouldn't be cool, you know?",
        "Lizzie: Do you see how lucky she is? I mean, after everything she's put you through, you still are protecting her.",
        "Joey: Yeah. I'm going to get going. Your family is going to be home soon, and I'm sure they'd freak out if there was a guy here.",
        "Lizzie: No, it's okay. My family loves it when I have friends over. In fact, I don't even think anyone's home. They're probably still at the party.",
        "Joey: Yeah. At least someone's having a good time tonight.",
        "Olivia: I understand that cassia raised a lot of money for her museum.",
        "Harley: Yes. Yes, that's certainly a possibility, yes.",
        "Phillip: Oh. Well, it's such a good cause. And I know you love a good cause. It just makes you feel warm inside to know that you're doing something good, doesn't it?",
        "Harley: You know what, Phillip? I just... I really have to get going.",
        "Olivia: Oh, we understand.",
        "Phillip: That's okay. We were on our way out. Oh, I wanted to ask you: You haven't sold any of your Spaulding stock, have you?",
        "Harley: No. No, I haven't sold any of it. No.",
        "Phillip: Smart woman. I know the share price took a nose-dive recently, but I promise you, it's on its way back up.",
        "Harley: Good.",
        "Phillip: In fact, for everybody who held on to it or for anybody who tried to buy up as much as they could possibly get, they're going to see it pay off in unexpected ways-- in very unexpected ways.",
        "Harley: What do you mean?",
        "Phillip: Enjoy the rest of your evening. Shall we go, my goddess?",
        "Harley: Okay, brad. It is well past midnight, and you still haven't gone for the money. What's up with that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: No, I swear! I didn't know anything about drugs.",
        "Alan: Oh, please, Alexandra.",
        "Alexandra: No, I swear it. I swear it. When I found out, I did try to stop it, but it was too late. It was...",
        "Gus: Are you the victim here all of a sudden? How did that happen?",
        "Alexandra: No, no. I was a fool, and a coward. Let me tell you, when I was sent to Spaulding, the European division, I felt exiled. I wanted to be right back here in Springfield.",
        "Alan: Yes, with your beloved family.",
        "Alexandra: Yes, my beloved family and my beloved company. I will admit to you, okay, I was a little desperate because I wanted to be back in the thick of things, right here at Spaulding headquarters, and I knew the only way to do that was to make a splash somewhere, and Brad Green came to me with a way.",
        "Gus: And Brad Green didn't mention anything about drugs to you at the time?",
        "Alexandra: Brad Green came to me with a marketing plan. I thought it was brilliant. He said the only thing he'd have to do, possibly, is jingle some numbers, but they'd all equal out in a few months, and I had to give him total operating freedom.",
        "Alan: And then the profits started rolling in, I bet, huh?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, yes. Oh, yes, they were wonderful, sky-high. Spaulding pharmaceuticals were never more profitable. And then, when you had your heart attack and you let me come back, everything was perfect. Spaulding was thriving, I was back in the family, and I ran across a memo that Brad Green obviously felt he had destroyed and shredded-- something about a pickup, a drop-off. It didn't look right to me. I confronted him with it. He looked at me with a smile and said he couldn't wait to tear my life to shreds.",
        "Gus: And at that moment, that's when he told you about the smuggling of antimonious from San Cristobel?",
        "Alexandra: Alan, I know this was a terrible mistake, a terrible mistake.",
        "Alan: You just didn't want to go to prison, did you?",
        "Alexandra: I actually thought about going to Jeffrey O'Neill. Oh, yes, make the kind of deal you made.",
        "Gus: Then why didn't you to go Jeffrey O'Neill? I mean, if what you're saying is true, he'd have cut you a break. You would have given him Brad Green, and he would have cut you a deal.",
        "Alexandra: Sure, sure. Because I was afraid! There were threats made. There were so... you know, I was also afraid that Jeffrey O'Neill couldn't really handle this point, and I was also ashamed to bring any more grief and unhappiness on this family. We'd had enough. And I didn't want to be the cause of anything worse happening!",
        "Alan: Believe me, you have made it worse, Alexandra.",
        "Alexandra: I don't know how to ask for your forgiveness.",
        "Gus: All right, look, I'm sorry. It's over, Alex. It's over, okay? I got brad green bringing drugs down here. I got you picking up the money. I'm sorry.",
        "Alan: No, Gus. Gus, I came here to confirm my suspicions. Now I am pleading with you for mercy. Do not arrest your Aunt Alexandra. Do not arrest her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: Coming up on \"Guiding light\"...",
        "Reva: Shoot me.",
        "Salerno: What?",
        "Reva: I mean it. Just shoot me. Go ahead. You've been threatening me over and over again. Just pull the trigger.",
        "Olivia: I never signed this. This is a forgery, a fraud.",
        "Phillip: Is that what you're accusing me of, Olivia? Fraud?",
        "Olivia: How long have you been there?",
        "Phillip: You changed already. It's early.",
        "Olivia: Somewhere. In this time zone, it's after midnight.",
        "Phillip: Oh, no, I meant it was early in that there may actually be one or two people left in this time zone who haven't seen you in that thing.",
        "Olivia: You feeling okay, sweetheart?",
        "Phillip: The butler, the cook. Although they would be among the few, as you were cooperative enough to parade yourself past every guest, waiter, and busboy at the party tonight.",
        "Olivia: What?",
        "Phillip: I'm sure you think that all the Spaulding board members that were there really enjoyed your little show, but, you see, \"cleavage on parade\" does not play well with the brain trust.",
        "Olivia: What are you doing, Phillip?",
        "Phillip: Oh, I'm simply stating the obvious. I think someone around here needs to do it.",
        "Olivia: I thought you were so proud of me tonight.",
        "Phillip: Proud of you? Proud of you? No. That would not have been me.",
        "Olivia: What are you up to, Phillip?",
        "Phillip: Why would I be up to anything?",
        "Olivia: Well, one minute I'm your goddess, the next minute I'm your tramp.",
        "Phillip: Maybe I'm just a multifaceted husband.",
        "Olivia: Cut the act.",
        "Phillip: Act? What act? Are you suggesting somehow that I'm faking my feelings?",
        "Olivia: Well...",
        "Phillip: Well, if I were doing something like that, then I'd be a fraud, wouldn't I? That's your territory.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: Lizzie, I don't know what I would have done without you tonight.",

        "Joey: No, no. No. You did the right thing telling me the truth about Tammy and Edmund.",
        "Lizzie: Well, you know, you're always so honest to me. I figured I owed it to you. But listen, you can call me any time you want, all right? I'll leave my cell phone on all night long. Whenever you want, just give me a call. (Laughs)",
        "Joey: Thanks. (Cell phone rings)",
        "Lizzie: Oh, that was fast! Oh, Tammy. Where are you? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Sure. Yeah. Come on over. Sweetie, calm down, it's okay. I'm right here. Wow, that was close. I guess everyone needs my help tonight.",

        "Gus: I caught her committing a crime. I'd say that constitutes a criminal.",
        "Alan: Now, I won't deny she had terrible judgment in this situation...",
        "Gus: I can't believe this!",
        "Alan: But the person who is to blame for all of this is Brad Green.",
        "Gus: Brad Green is her accomplice. That's what Brad Green is.",
        "Alan: He dreamed up this entire scheme and conned her into going along with it.",

        "Alan: Look, all I am asking...",
        "Gus: I know what you're asking. I know what you're asking, and the answer is no.",

        "Gus: Brad Green is coming down here?",
        "Harley: Yes. Yes. He is definitely on his way down. I still can't figure out why he waited so long, but he's on his way down there, and I say when he grabs the money and comes upstairs, we bust him.",
        "Gus: All right, so he is coming down here. All right, listen, Coop, if you can hear me. It's a little bit more complicated... (Static) Coop?",

        "Alan: Well, you saw him drop off the drugs earlier. You have three witnesses that just saw him pick up the money. He carried out a complete drug deal, Gus. All you have to do now is arrest him. Case closed. (Static)",
        "Harley: Gus? Gus, can you hear me? This thing keeps cutting out. Did you see him?",
        "Gus: Yeah, I saw him.",

        "Salerno: Thought you could get the drop on me, huh? All right, listen up, whoever's in command out there. Here's what's happening. The two of us are getting in my car and we're driving to the airport. When I get there, I want a plane waiting, fueled and ready to go.

        "Phillip: Are you feeling okay?",
        "Olivia: I'm fine.",
        "Phillip: Well, I only ask, Olivia, because I didn't buy you that dress. I'd never pick out anything as trashy as that.",

        "Olivia: I never signed this. This is a forgery, a fraud.",
        "Phillip: A fraud? Now, that's interesting. That's the second time that word has come up in this conversation. Is that what you're accusing me of, Olivia? Fraud? That's a serious accusation to make of someone.",
        "Olivia: I never signed this credit card slip.",
        "Phillip: Oh. Okay. Well, let's say for the moment that you didn't, and I did, and that I am guilty of fraud-- I wonder where I would have gotten the idea to do something as common and as blatantly illegal as that.",

        "Salerno: Well, that would be a sight, but no deal. I've got no edge with you, O'Neill. The only reason one of your guys hasn't taken a shot at me is because I've got Springfield's TV sweetheart with me, huh? Who would risk a shot and hit her? That would be tragic. That would be a big mistake.",

        "Alan: When you came back to Springfield, you were hell-bent on making sure that Danny Santos was put behind bars. You faked evidence, you lied under oath, and you broke every rule in the book, didn't you? And why? Because the Danny Santos family was responsible for your father's death. Forget the law, Gus. There is no justice. We must always put family first, and that is what I'm asking you now: To put your new family first.",
        "Gus: Alan, my father-- the man who raised me-- he was an honest man. He knew what justice was. Alan, I don't bend the law to protect criminals; I bend the law to catch them. That is my justice.",
        "Alan: I realize this is a very tough choice for you, but never forget, Gus, that you are a Spaulding. And Spaulding's take care of their own, just like the august family did. Do you see? We're identical in many ways. So why don't you just look at this as an opportunity?",
        "Gus: For what?",
        "Alan: An opportunity to do for your new family what you couldn't do for your other family. An opportunity to save Alex when you couldn't save Eden. Lauren Anderson and Craig Shand started dating until senior year. By the authority vested in me by the laws of the state",
        "Gus: This is insane, you know that? This whole... this is insane. Insane!",

        "Brad: Not alone.",
        "Gus: It is not that I don't have loyalty to this family; it's the opposite. It's the opposite, because she betrayed you. She betrayed every single one of us. Look, all right, maybe Brad Green lied to her, maybe he pressured her or whatever, but she chose-- she chose-- to be a part of this.",
        "Alan: And we will punish her our way, Gus. Don't turn her over to the outsiders. They will get it wrong-- they always do-- and you will regret it until your dying days.",

        "Harley: Oh, god. Chest compressions.",
        "Gus: Look, do you realize it doesn't even matter what I think right now. It doesn't matter, because green is going to give her... he's going to give you up the minute he's arrested, do you understand that? He's probably talking to cooper upstairs right this second. Hello? Coop?",
