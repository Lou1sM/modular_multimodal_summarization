        "Reva: Hi.",
        "Josh: Hi, there.",
        "Reva: Is Jonathan around?",
        "Josh: Actually, you just missed him.",
        "Reva: Thank God.",
        "Josh: Excuse me?",
        "Reva: He's the last person I want to see right now.",
        "Josh: Since when?",
        "Reva: You know, maybe you were right about him. You know, I thought I was going to make a difference with him, that he was going to come around.",
        "Josh: And he's not?",
        "Reva: And I don't know what to think. You know, I mean, he's trying so hard. He's working here with you, trying hard and then...",
        "Josh: Are you okay?",
        "Reva: ( Sighs ) I really thought he was coming through, that I was getting through to him, you know. And when that was working, it gave me something to cling to, you know? But now that's all gone, and I don't know what's left for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: You know, people could see us out here together.",
        "Nate: Look, I know I've been a little rough-- planting the drugs on you, making Reva think that you were after that hot little niece of hers.",
        "Jonathan: All in a day's work, huh, dad?",
        "Nate: I did it to prove a point: That I'm the only one you can count on.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, yeah, Salt of the Earth.",
        "Nate: Reva may make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside, but she doesn't want a son. She wants a lap dog. One stain on the rug, and you're out in the backyard, or worse.",
        "Jonathan: So what now?",
        "Nate: Now continue to work my magic on Reva.",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs )",
        "Nate: You go back to what I raised you to do: Wrecking the lives of the people who hurt us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: What I had in mind was an intimate gathering in celebration of my wife, and we have a great deal to celebrate, including the fact that she's made me the happiest man in the world. And nothing is going to keep us from being together.",
        "Tammy: Fancy spread. So I guess you and Edmund are...",
        "Cassie: Back together.",
        "Tammy: And that's a good thing?",
        "Cassie: Yep.",
        "Tammy: Okay.",
        "Cassie: Honey, I know that things have been really...",
        "Tammy: Awful.",
        "Cassie: I was going to say \"complicated.\" And me being back with Edmund, you know, it is... it's for the best. It's best for the family.",
        "Tammy: I hope you're right.",
        "Cassie: Tammy, Edmund and I are finally going to have a baby, and I want that baby to grow up in a very safe, loving environment. And I wasn't able to give you and your brothers that for a long time, okay? Now, I really believe that this is right. I do.",
        "Tammy: And you don't have any doubts?",
        "Cassie: I did, but I don't anymore. Getting back together with Edmund is what this family needs, okay? It's what I need.",
        "Tammy: Okay. Then I just have one question.",
        "Cassie: What's that?",
        "Tammy: You keep talking about what's best and what you need. What about what you want?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: I've got to take care of something first.",
        "Dinah: Hi there, Sexy.",
        "Jonathan: I already told you I'm not interested.",
        "Dinah: In me?",
        "Jonathan: No, not in you. In whatever you plan on doing to Cassie.",
        "Dinah: Can't a girl just come over and say hi?",
        "Jonathan: You don't want anything?",
        "Dinah: Of course I do. Look, I made a recording of Edmund, and it could have caused a lot of trouble.",
        "Jonathan: So?",
        "Dinah: So it got erased, and now I'm stuck.",
        "Jonathan: So you want my advice?",
        "Dinah: Well, not quite. I just need someone who's hated even more than me, and that's you. So I need you to help me drive Edmund crazy.",
        "Jonathan: You want to drive Uncle Eddie crazy? ( Laughs ) It's too late. That dude took the short bus to Psychoville a long time ago.",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs ) Maybe not crazy. Just... I want to push him. I want to make him angry. You know, I think that's good. Angry people talk. They say things that people need to hear.",
        "Jonathan: Hm. I see. So you want to do a take-two with Eddie, huh?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Yeah, I actually have a brand- new recorder, right here.",
        "Jonathan: Well, that sounds like some masterful planning. But you're on your own, Dee.",
        "Dinah: No, no. Come here, come here. It's only going to take a few minutes, and I'm going to do all the work, okay? Come here.",
        "Edmund: Dinah, what the hell do you think you're doing?",
        "Dinah: Edmund. Relax. He didn't do anything.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. I didn't do anything.",
        "Edmund: Dinah, are you completely out of your mind?",
        "Dinah: Edmund...",
        "Edmund: That's Jonathan.",
        "Dinah: I know who it is. I talked to you about the book and the sex drive and the pregnancy thing, okay? And you made it very clear that you were not available.",
        "Edmund: I've heard enough. And you're coming with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I love Edmund. I wouldn't have married him if I didn't, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: Well, a lot of things have changed since then. I mean, you found out he smacked Jeffrey upside the head with a shovel, started a fire. He put your embryo in...",
        "Cassie: Okay, yeah, I get that. All right? I know that, Tammy. But you know what? He loves me, and he loves you guys.",
        "Tammy: Well, if you're cool with that, I guess I'm cool with it.",
        "Cassie: I'm cool with it. Come on. Let's get out of here. What's this?",
        "Tammy: Let's find out. \"Dear Mrs. Winslow, You once said something to me that really stuck in my head. It turned into a pretty decent song. I thought you might want to sing it to your baby someday. Enclosed you'll find the sheet music and a dollar for royalties.\" Oh, my God. Mom, Jeffrey O'Neil wrote a song about you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: ( Tuning guitar ) Let it go, O'Neil. Let her go and get on with it. ( Sighs )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Hey, Mom, are you okay?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. Do you want to go get a salad?",
        "Tammy: I would love to, but actually, I have to meet Sandy at Towers.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Then how about I give you a ride?",
        "Tammy: Great.",
        "Cassie: Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: Nice work if you can get it. You'll have to introduce us sometime. She's not really your type, though, is she? You always preferred the innocent ones, if I remember correctly.",
        "Jonathan: Never mind her.",
        "Nate: Suit yourself. What time are you expected back in the office with Step daddy Josh?",
        "Jonathan: After what you did to me in front of Reva the other day? She'll have him fire me on the spot.",
        "Nate: No.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah.",
        "Nate: You've got to have faith, Johnny, like I've got faith in you. And like I've still got faith in your so-called mother.",
        "Jonathan: You have faith in Reva?",
        "Nate: I've seen her type a thousand times, carrying on like they're better than everyone else, smarter. But we know better, don't we?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I guess so.",
        "Nate: You know so. Deep down inside, you want to prove to them that they can't laugh at people like us. They can't just kick us to the side of the street whenever they get the notion. Well, prove to me, son that that's the way you feel. That I can trust you to take down Reva, Josh, the whole lot of them. Take them down and take their money.",
        "Jonathan: I said yes, didn't I?",
        "Nate: It's time to see you actually do something about it.",
        "Jonathan: Like what?",
        "Nate: Well, since I went through your trust fund, I'm kind of light in the pocket, Johnny. I need some walking-around money. Get it from the Lewis's.",
        "Jonathan: How? How do you want me to do that?",
        "Nate: You're smarter than they are, remember? You'll think of something. Oh, one more thing. While I'm taking care of Reva, I'm assigning you a project of your own: I want to see you make somebody else in the family look bad, real bad.",
        "Jonathan: Anybody in particular?",
        "Nate: Surprise me. Josh, or cutesy-wutesy Tammy, or what's his name, your wannabe clone.",
        "Jonathan: Sandy?",
        "Nate: That's the one. Go forth and prosper. Make them miserable. Make us rich.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: I know you put a lot of your energy into Jonathan. You put a lot of yourself into Jonathan, and obviously he's done something now that's let you down. But that happens, you know? The world doesn't come to an end. We both knew that Jonathan was not going to be easy.",
        "Reva: I know. I just thought that I understood him.",
        "Josh: And now you're a little shaky on that, huh? Let me tell you something. You want to lean on somebody? You want to count on somebody? I'm your guy. I'm not going to go anywhere. I'm not going to let you down.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, you better not if you know what's good for you.",
        "Josh: ( Laughs ) Yes, ma'am. And if you want somebody to deal with Jonathan, I'm your guy, too.",
        "Reva: No way. I remember what happened the last time you said you were going to try to help him.",
        "Josh: It'll be different this time. Now he's on the company insurance policy, so, you know...",
        "Reva: That's cute. Maybe it would be best if I just let him go.",
        "Josh: Let me give it a try, okay? Maybe I can turn him into somebody that we can all get along with.",
        "Reva: Maybe. But did you ever think that there are those people that just don't fit into any mold? You know, you beat your head up against them again and again, time and time again, and it just doesn't make any difference? I mean, what are you supposed to do with somebody like that?",
        "Josh: You fight and fight. And when you're tired of doing that, you fight some more. But you never give up.",
        "Reva: Doesn't it just wear you out, Bud? Taking care of somebody that can't even take care of themselves?",
        "Josh: Yeah, sometimes. But if you really love the person and care about the person, you don't give up.",
        "Reva: It used to be so easy.",
        "Josh: When was that?",
        "Reva: Oh, I don't know. Maybe \"easy\" isn't the right word, but there was a time when I could make things better, for the kids and for you.",
        "Josh: We're in it together, darling.",
        "Reva: I know. When I'm in your arms, it makes me feel safe, but it also makes me feel like if you're not holding on, I'm going to spin out into a hundred different pieces.",
        "Jonathan: Hey. Hope I'm not interrupting anything.",
        "Reva: I'll take that as my cue to leave. I've got to go to work, so I'll see you later.",
        "Josh: I love you.",
        "Reva: I love you.",
        "Jonathan: Don't mind me. I just work here. So do I get my severance pay now, or...",
        "Josh: Your mother is out of sorts with you.",
        "Jonathan: You think?",
        "Josh: It's my job to take care of her, and that's what I'm doing by keeping you on here.",
        "Jonathan: You're so clueless, you don't even know what Reva's getting herself into.",
        "Josh: Well, why don't you clue me in, then?",
        "Jonathan: Never mind.",
        "Josh: No, no, no. Never mind the never mind. Tell me what's going on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Hey. Nice bumping into you here.",
        "Sandy: You showed up. I'm so excited. I thought you might have forgotten. I didn't call earlier because I was stuck on the job site. No service.",
        "Tammy: Oh. And I thought you might be annoyed about last night.",
        "Sandy: No. I had a great time with you, and your mom and Edmund.",
        "Tammy: I know it's not exactly how we intended the night to go.",
        "Sandy: That's okay.",
        "Tammy: No, it's not. How about tonight? You, me, no interruptions.",
        "Sandy: Tonight would be perfect.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Jonathan?",
        "Dinah: Well, I didn't realize I was looking for your approval when it came to my dates.",
        "Edmund: Date? Jonathan doesn't date, Dinah. He lays siege.",
        "Dinah: Maybe I am looking for some companionship, Edmund. And you know what they say. He may not be Mr. Right, but he could be Mr. Right for right now.",
        "Edmund: God, I'd rather see you seek companionship from his snake.",
        "Dinah: Well, I'm going to assume you're talking about the pet.",
        "Edmund: Sleeping with Jonathan is incredibly irresponsible.",
        "Dinah: Edmund, your concern is not for me, it's for the baby. And you can control what's growing inside of me, but you cannot control me.",
        "Edmund: Is that so?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, and I think you need to be careful with these charges of irresponsibility.",
        "Edmund: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Dinah: I think you need to remember what I know about you.",
        "Edmund: Oh, God, here we go again, Dinah the one-hit wonder. I am getting really sick of this one.",
        "Dinah: Wow, you know what? I'm not. I don't think you're seeing how much I'm doing for you. Do you know how hard it is to keep quiet about this behavior of yours towards Alonzo every time Cassie's in the room?",
        "Edmund: Cassie was going to have to hand over Will to Alonzo no matter what I did.",
        "Dinah: What you did?",
        "Edmund: Yes, what I did! ( Exasperated sigh ) Let's not do this, because contrary to popular opinion, Dinah, I really do care about you. Your feelings.",
        "Dinah: Do you?",
        "Edmund: Yes, of course I do. Look, perhaps I was... I was a little too quick to turn down your offer. Look, you don't... you don't have to go to Jonathan or anyone else. You have me. And if you have needs, I'm sure I can meet them for you. Come on. Just, before we go any further, Dinah... what's this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: I want to sing a new song, and it was inspired by somebody that I used to know. So here it goes. ( Plays guitar )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: So what exactly did you have in mind for tonight?",
        "Sandy: You are kidding, right?",
        "Tammy: I just meant, do you think we should go out first?",
        "Sandy: Oh, I was thinking more along the lines of taking you in, to my apartment. ( Cell phone rings ) Hold on a second. I've got to... Hello? Oh. Hi. Can I... hold on a second. So I got your letter. I miss you, too. Is it okay if I call you back later? Great. Okay. You, too. Bye.",
        "Tammy: Anything good?",
        "Sandy: Not so good. Josh, work, emergency. Could be a while.",
        "Tammy: A long while?",
        "Sandy: Maybe.",
        "Tammy: Work's work. Rain check?",
        "Sandy: Absolutely. Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: ( Strums guitar ) You know, I think I'm going to take a quick break before I get started. I'll be back. Sorry.",
        "Cassie: What happened?",
        "Jeffrey: I kind of lost the moment there.",
        "Cassie: I really wanted to hear you play that song.",
        "Jeffrey: I heard Edmund can play the piano, and that's why I put the music in there, so he could play it for you. Okay?",
        "Cassie: You wrote it. I want to hear you play it. Besides, I'm the McCartney to your Lennon, right?",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie, um...",
        "Cassie: Did you ever, I don't know, wonder what would have happened if we would have came into each other's lives at a different point? You think we would have killed each other after two dates?",
        "Jeffrey: No, I think it would have been good. I think it would have been better than good. But I'm not interested, you know, in what might have been. I'm more interested in there here and now, you know what I mean?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: This is so not what it looks like.",
        "Edmund: Really? Because it so looks like a recording device.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, it is.",
        "Edmund: So like a running recording device.",
        "Dinah: You're not going to believe me anyway.",
        "Edmund: Try me.",
        "Dinah: Okay. I needed to record your voice so I could listen to it in bed and play it when I am alone, because they say that a child should be familiar with their father's voice.",
        "Edmund: Oh. Well, that makes perfect sense. Of course, it also explains why you barged in here, got rid of me, and played a tape for Cassie, a tape with Sandy's voice on it. Care to try again?",
        "Dinah: Do you understand how hard it is for me to see and to hear you and Cassie together, down the hall, when I'm alone?",
        "Edmund: Dinah, I know. I understand. It's just...",
        "Dinah: It is a knife. It is a knife in my heart. I happen to believe that you two do not belong together. She doesn't deserve you. And I'm the only woman that can make you happy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Tell me. Let's hear it. What's Reva gotten herself into?",
        "Jonathan: Well, Reva's always getting herself into things. I mean, you should know that better than anybody.",
        "Josh: You know what? Actually, I don't need you to tell me about Reva. And quite frankly, I don't like her telling me about you, either.",
        "Jonathan: Her tell you about me?",
        "Josh: The point is, you work for me. You don't work for Reva, so you do what I tell you to do.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, really?",
        "Josh: Really. Yes. Now, I'm not going to give you the satisfaction of being fired, because-- I can't believe these words are about to come out of my mouth-- you're actually doing a pretty good job around here.",
        "Jonathan: Why, Joshua, a compliment from you?",
        "Josh: Just a fact. Nothing more, nothing less. Now, if this mysterious problem with your mother makes you want to quit, that's fine with me. I don't care. But I'm not going to fire you unless you give me a good reason to, or unless you fail completely, which most people are expecting you to do.",
        "Jonathan: Well, if I quit, I mean, I don't get a Severance Package, right? And then I can't collect Unemployment, so I'll stay.",
        "Josh: That's the kind of attitude that's going to get you climbing up the stairs in this place. That was great. Terrific. I need you to download the current figures from the Oklahoma Deal. I've got to go get something in Billy's office. I'll be back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: (Remembering) Since I went through your trust fund, I'm kind of light in the pockets. I need some walking-around money. Get it from the Lewis's. The loveliest sight I've seen all day.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) And you are the sorriest. It's early, and you're drunk already?",
        "Nate: Drunk? No. Drinking, maybe. But drunk, no.",
        "Reva: You can call it whatever you want, but you're not going to make a very good impression on your customers.",
        "Nate: No, not at all, because if we don't have any customers, they cannot be disappointed in my behavior.",
        "Reva: What are you talking about, no customers?",
        "Nate: It's appalling. Have I ever told you you're my favorite bartender?",
        "Reva: Once or twice. What do you mean, no customers?",
        "Nate: Oh. There's a payment due on a loan by the end of the business today, and I don't have nearly enough money to pay. And if I pour drinks this poorly all the time, I'm not surprised.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) You can get an extension.",
        "Nate: Not on the health inspection.",
        "Reva: Health inspection?",
        "Nate: Yeah. Yeah, he's... he's due any minute, and I'm fairly confident this place will not pass.",
        "Reva: Well, we have to get you sober before the Health Inspector shows up.",
        "Nate: Me being sober will not improve our score one little bit.",
        "Reva: Well, then just humor me. Let me get you the coffee.",
        "Nate: Okay. You humor me and join me in a dance.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) No. No, no, no, no, no. No. I'm not going to... it's not the time. Oh. Hello. ( Laughs )",
        "Nate: Reva.",
        "Reva: What?",
        "Nate: It has been so very long since I held a woman in my arms that felt this good.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, that... you know, that's very, very nice to hear, but it's also too soon, too much.",
        "Nate: No, no, no. Too much is never enough.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) Okay, Mr. Astaire. Come over here. You're going to sit down, you're going to have some coffee and lie back and just rest.",
        "Nate: ( Laughs ) I could get used to this very easily.",
        "Reva: Okay. Okay, okay.",
        "Nate: Tell me something, Barkeep.",
        "Reva: What?",
        "Nate: Do you have any idea at all how much I want you?",
        "Reva: I am flattered, but that is the booze talking.",
        "Nate: No, the booze is allowing me to speak from my heart. In vino veritas.",
        "Reva: I'm getting you the coffee.",
        "Nate: You are a beautiful, exciting, fascinating woman, and you make me laugh all the time. And when I'm awake, I think of you, and when I'm sleeping, I dream...",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) You really are drunk.",
        "Nate: You know, actually, I'm lying. I dream of you all the time, even when we're working side to side.",
        "Reva: You don't know what you're saying.",
        "Nate: No, I know exactly what I'm saying. Reva, let me make you feel as good as you make me feel. Please.",
        "Reva: This would be so easy to do, but I can't.",
        "Nate: I'm glad I won't remember this part when I wake up.",
        "Reva: You are a sweet man.",
        "Nate: As Winston Churchill once never said when he was in his cups...",
        "Reva: ( Laughs )",
        "Nate: Shut up. He never said, \"In the morning, madam, I will be sober, but you will still be beautiful.\" Now, I'm going to lay down for a minute. My eyes are tired.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) Reva Lewis, you really, really need to walk right out that door right now and never come back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: All right. Here we go, Accounting. Protected password. Great. Let's see. \"Reva?\" No. \"Shayne?\" No. It couldn't be \"Jonathan,\" could it? Great.",
        "Reva: You don't have to do this, Jonathan. After everything we've been through, I'm still your mother. I never wanted to give you away, and now that you're back in my life, I realize that you are part of my very soul.",
        "Nate: Rubbish. Do you hear how she manipulates the situation? She never wanted to give you away. She's still trying to give you away now, isn't she? Reva: I'm speaking from my heart.",
        "Nate: You're speaking from calculation. Every little thing you do is designed to show how smart you are, how superior you are to people like me and Jonathan. It's all about humiliating you, kiddo. That's her entire game.",
        "Reva: This isn't a game! This is about a son and his mother.",
        "Nate: Yeah. I suppose it is. But which son? Jonathan or Sandy? ( Chuckles ) tell me, which one is closest to this heart of yours?",
        "Jonathan: Great. Locked desk drawer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Hello, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: Hey, the big, bad boss man.",
        "Josh: Oh, come on. I'm not that bad, am I?",
        "Tammy: Calling Sandy away from me earlier was a little much.",
        "Josh: I didn't call Sandy in today. In fact, I gave him the day off.",
        "Tammy: Oh. I guess I got something mixed up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: You didn't want that kiss to break, did you?",
        "Edmund: Dinah, listen to me.",
        "Dinah: No. Because I don't want to hear how much you love Cassie. And I really don't want to hear how you will deny that there's anything between us.",
        "Edmund: No, Dinah, there is no us. There's no us. I don't love you, I'm never going to love you, and the quicker you remove that from your fantasy world, the better.",
        "Dinah: I think if you don't give us a chance, you'll be sorry.",
        "Edmund: What was that? Another threat? I have tried everything with you. I've tried being sympathetic. I have tried being nice. None of it works, Dinah, so no more. I'm going to spit out a few things. Let's see what you can figure out, all right? First of all, you are never going to try to trap me again. Do you understand?",
        "Dinah: Yeah.",
        "Edmund: If you ever think you know anything, shut your mouth. Because if you don't, I'm going to make you feel more alone than you've ever felt in your life before. You're going to crank out that baby, and then I'm going to have you run out of town. And if you don't think I can turn everyone in Springfield against you, you've got another thing coming. I can do it, and you know I can.",
        "Dinah: I know you can, yeah.",
        "Edmund: Good. So drop it. If I even hear you whisper the name \"Jonathan\" again, I'm going to consider it a threat, and you know how I deal with threats, don't you?",
        "Dinah: I do.",
        "Edmund: One thing, Dinah: I want a happy, bouncing baby. Deliver it. Oh, oh, wait, wait. Sorry. One more thing. I'm having a party for Cassie, a celebration of our future together. I want you to be there, and be really happy for us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I inspired the song. It's my right to hear it.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, is it? Well, you know, you're very persistent, Mrs. Winslow.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I know I am, Mr. O'Neil.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, fine, I'll do it, but you have to sing backup.",
        "Cassie: Oh. ( Laughs ) No. See, my singing days are over.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, I guess they are. I guess a lot of things are.",
        "Cassie: You know what? You're right. This is probably the last place I should be right now.",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie... Hi again. I guess we'll pick it up where we left off. This is a new song. ( Plays guitar ) Which way does the wind blow 'cause that's the way I'll go I'm just kicking down the street far away from everything and I don't pay no mind to people telling me I'm wasting time all my life I go the other way I know that's right...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Hey. What are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: You make me feel like I'm not in a rut, that there's still surprises left for me. So I'm just going to feel that, and see where that road takes me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: And I've been to London and I've been to Paris, too and I've been all around the world watching what the people do but of all the things I saw there's nothing that compares to your sweet eyes all my life I go the other way with you because I know that's right. ( Applause ) thank you. And thank you for the inspiration. Can I buy you a drink?",
        "Woman: Sure.",
        "Jeffrey: Two beers, please. Hey.",
        "Cassie: Nice song.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, thanks. I'm glad you liked it. Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Mr. O'Neil.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I guess we're going to grab a table. See you later. Come on.",
        "Cassie: I was about to send a search party out for you. I called you earlier. What's going on? Are you okay?",
        "Edmund: Oh, yeah. Everything's fine. Everything all right with you?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Perfect.",
        "Edmund: Good. Good, because I've got a surprise for you.",
        "Cassie: Is it a good one?",
        "Edmund: I'd like to think so. I'm throwing a bit of a party for you in celebration of our family's strength, and of course our love.",
        "Cassie: Sounds wonderful.",
        "Edmund: I want to make you happy, Cassie. And I don't want anything to stand in the way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Good old Edmund is going to throw a party for princess Cassie. Very sweet. Well, I guess I could sulk, but no. I think I'm going to take this as an opportunity to make sure it's a night that Cassie never forgets.",

        "Edmund: Everything has to be perfect.",
        "Dinah: None of us will forget what happens at the bash tonight.",
        "Jeffrey: She's made her choice. Do I like it? No, I hate it.",
        "Dinah: Here's what's on my mind.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, your love is the most precious thing I have.",
        "Dinah: Don't they look cozy? I'm not going to shut my mouth. The truth is going to come out, and it's going to come out right now. Please, please. Don't touch me."
