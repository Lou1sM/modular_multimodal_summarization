        "H.B.: Josh. Joshua.",
        "Josh: ( Groans )",
        "H.B.: Come on, now, boy. You know what the word is on the early bird, don't you?",
        "Josh: He eats worms. Daddy? Oh, my.",
        "H.B.: Don't lie there staring at me, son. Nobody ever got a dream built by staying horizontal. Up and at 'em!",
        "Josh: You know, the minute that I found those plans in your old desk there, I knew that I was going to be building this thing. I had to do a couple of add- ons, though. I mean, not to change anything, but just to make it state-of- the-art. Like, for instance, right here, this... this wing right here. That's going to be for nuclear medicine. These are things that... these are things that weren't even dreamt of when you were doing your dreaming, so... do you not like it? Because if there's something wrong, then you just need to tell me what that is, and... and I can fix it.",
        "H.B.: There's nothing to fix when you get it right the first time, son. This is more than I could have asked for. Josh, I'm proud of you. Say, did I ever tell you the one about the traveling salesman and the milking machine? ( Laughter )",
        "Josh: It won't stop until it gets 12 quarts.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Hey, Joshua. Hey, hey, Bud. Hey, hi. Carlotta. ( Laughs )",
        "Josh: Oh! Yes, Carlotta.",
        "Reva: You all right?",
        "Josh: Yeah, I'm fine. I was just dreaming, that's all.",
        "Reva: Yeah, you were dreaming and mumbling. Mumbling the punch line from one of those old jokes that Harlan used to tell.",
        "Josh: That's exactly what it was. He was here. He was right... standing right there. As real as you or me. And then...",
        "Reva: Yeah?",
        "Josh: Then we were... we were standing by his old desk, and I was showing him the plans for the hospital, and he was just staring at them. He didn't say anything. For a minute there, I thought... I thought that he hated everything that I had done.",
        "Reva: Did he?",
        "Josh: No. He said he was proud of me.",
        "Reva: Well, that's nothing new.",
        "Josh: It felt so good to be there with him. I didn't really want to wake up. I'm sorry.",
        "Reva: You miss him, don't you, sweetie?",
        "Josh: I do. Especially right now. Now that his dream is becoming a reality, it'd be nice to have him here with me, you know, standing by my side. But then again, it would probably hurt twice as much to have to lose him again. I mean, you know how it is. When you lose somebody, you have that sense of helplessness because you have no hope of ever getting them back again.",
        "Reva: ( Sighs )",
        "Josh: You okay?",
        "Reva: Yeah.",
        "Josh: You cold or something?",
        "Reva: No, no. I'm fine.",
        "Josh: I'm really thankful that I have you. Oh, man. We'd better get going if we're going to be in Chicago by this afternoon.",
        "Reva: Chicago?",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Reva: What?",
        "Josh: Oh, come on. ( Laughs ) How soon they forget. The sculptor, the guy who's going to do the bust of H.B. that's going to be in the lobby of this... of the hospital.",
        "Reva: Ah, it's all coming back to me now.",
        "Josh: Okay. ( Cell phone rings ) Huh, that's weird. It's Cedars calling for you. I wonder why they're calling this early in the morning.",
        "Reva: Uh, yeah, you know what that's probably Charles Grant. He... he's going to give me some staffing recommendations for the clinic.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Reva: You go make us coffee and I'll handle this.",
        "Josh: You got a deal. ( Laughs ) Oh, ow, oh.",
        "Reva: This is Reva Lewis. No, I haven't forgotten what day it is, if that's what you mean. Tell Dr. McCabe that I will be there for my chemo. ( Sighs )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Whoa! Okay, okay. This is for you. I love the new look and everything, but...",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) I know, sweetie, I just, I want to... you know, I'm thinking I might go red. I want to walk in the shoes of a redhead today.",
        "Josh: Here's the thing, though, darling. I appreciate that, but, after this meeting, I was planning to take you out to a really nice, you know, meal and maybe...",
        "Reva: Well, yeah, you know, about... about the whole trip thing. I... I can't go to Chicago with you.",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Reva: It's just... something's come up.",
        "Josh: You... Reva...",
        "Reva: I know. It's that same thing. It's... again, again. I know what you're thinking, that I miss the... the fundraising party, I miss the groundbreaking, I miss the interview...",
        "Josh: What's going on? Reva.",
        "Reva: Don't you think that I would be there with you today if I could?",
        "Josh: Yeah, I... okay. Okay.",
        "Reva: Are you sure?",
        "Josh: Yes, I'm sure. It's... it's fine. I would be lying to you if I were to say that I'm not disappointed, but I know you'll be there with me-- in spirit, at least.",
        "Reva: Joshua...",
        "Josh: No, really, honey, it's fine. If you can't go, you can't go. I can't expect you to drop everything that you're doing for this project. I understand that.",
        "Reva: I wish I could.",
        "Josh: Look, you know what? This actually doesn't have to be an issue. I'm going to call this guy right now, I'm going to get a rain check on this, you know...",
        "Reva: No, no, no! No, you're not! No, you're not. You're going to go to Chicago. You're going to... you're going to take that trip just as you planned, because look at you. Look how much you love the idea of this. I don't want you to cancel it. And you know what else? You're not going to have to go alone. You're not, because... see?",
        "Cassie: ( Laughs ) Well, look at you!",
        "Reva: My name is Carlotta! I'm just trying the red, you know, thing.",
        "Cassie: Ah...",
        "Josh: Reva, did you talk Cassie into going to Chicago with me?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. But you know, I was thinking on the way over that I think that Josh should just postpone the trip.",
        "Josh: Yeah, that's pretty much what I was thinking, too.",
        "Reva: No! Please, don't be silly!",
        "Cassie: This project is your baby.",
        "Reva: Yes, all the more reason why we shouldn't waste any time. You need to get that hospital up and running. Believe me, with that bust of H.B. in the lobby as soon as possible.",
        "Cassie: Well, then, you should go.",
        "Reva: You know, I would be sitting there right next to that seat with you, if...",
        "Josh: If what?",
        "Reva: It's... it's an emergency with Jonathan.",
        "Josh: Let me guess. He's in trouble again, right?",
        "Reva: Well, no, it's more like trouble kind of keeps sticking to him. Doris Wolfe has clamped onto him again and won't let go.",
        "Cassie: But I thought you guys had made headway on getting the charges against him dropped.",
        "Reva: Well, we... we thought so too, but, you know, she just... Madame D.A. threw us a curve ball. And Jonathan made it all worse by blowing up again.",
        "Josh: Gee. You know, that kid, I don't know, somehow he just doesn't know when to back off. I wonder where he got that from.",
        "Reva: Oh, come on, you two. Really, I mean, that is all the more reason why I need to stay and smooth things over, right?",
        "Josh: I know, I know, I know. I just hate this.",
        "Reva: You know, it takes one to know one. I know you do.",
        "Josh: It seems like, Reva, that something or... whatever has kept you from being a part of the bigger moments of this project.",
        "Reva: I love this project as much as I love you-- well, almost as much as I love you-- but I'd be lying if I said that my son doesn't claim a part of my heart, too.",
        "Josh: I know, Reva.",
        "Reva: And you figure in this too, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: I do? Why?",
        "Reva: Because, you know, I've been behind Tammy and Jonathan from the very beginning over your objections. And now I feel like I owe you, to give you the best that Jonathan has to offer, so you don't have to worry about Tammy anymore. So that she can have the life that she deserves.",
        "Cassie: Remind me to get you one of those \"World's Greatest Sister\" mugs, would you?",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) Yeah, well, you know I keep trying.",
        "Cassie: And I really like the wig.",
        "Reva: Oh, thanks.",
        "Cassie: I think it works.",
        "Reva: Thank you. You know, I... I should go. I really should.",
        "Josh: Yep.",
        "Reva: And... you should go, too.",
        "Josh: I know, I know.",
        "Reva: Have a safe trip.",
        "Josh: Thank you.",
        "Reva: You, too. See you, guys.",
        "Cassie: Is she okay?",
        "Josh: Yeah, I think so. I just you know, in some ways, things have never been better between Reva and me.",
        "Cassie: Well, that's really saying something.",
        "Josh: We've come such a long way. We've closed a huge gap. And in some ways, it feels like it was never there in the first place, and I feel her support, and I know she wants to make this marriage work, and so do I, so...",
        "Cassie: That's great. I'm happy for you both.",
        "Josh: So why am I not jumping for joy? I get it. You know, somebody's got to stand up for Jonathan, because God knows nobody besides Reva has the patience to do that, but... but still, sometimes...",
        "Cassie: Sometimes?",
        "H.B.: Sometimes a man just wants his woman when he wants her, plain and simple.",
        "Josh: Yeah, there's nothing plain and simple about Reva.",
        "Cassie: Well, that's true, but, you know, you wouldn't want it any other way, would you?",
        "Josh: What? No, no. You're right. I wouldn't want it any other way.",
        "Cassie: Josh, if you don't want me to go to Chicago with you...",
        "Josh: You know what, Cassie? No offense, but I... I think I'm going to put off the Chicago trip until Reva can go with me. Special delivery for Reva Shayne Lewis! Reva! ( Cell phone rings ) What? Hello? Yeah, you know, I think this is a wrong number, I... what? Yes, this is Josh Lewis. Would you mind telling me what this is about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Would you stop looking at me? I'm not thinking about you. The guy is not only married, he's married to your sister. Get over it already. I thought cousins was a bad idea. Mop and forget. I'm mopping. I'm forgetting. Mopping and forgetting. I'm going to get a fresh bucket of water, and I am going to wash that man...",
        "Josh: Cassie? Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!",
        "Cassie: Oh, sorry. Hi.",
        "Josh: Hi. Oh, I got a call fm R.J.'s school.",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Josh: Can I come in?",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Josh: There's a problem.",
        "Cassie: What kind of problem? Is he sick?",
        "Josh: No, he's not sick. He... apparently, he got in a fight. Actually, he started a fight, and the counselor would like to talk to us as soon as we can get there.",
        "Cassie: Us? I don't... I don't get why would they even have called you first.",
        "Josh: Because R.J. gave them my cell number, and then he begged the counselor to talk to me instead of you.",
        "Cassie: Well, that's weird.",
        "Josh: Yeah, I know. But... fighting, it's kind of a guy thing, and he probably thought that I would understand in a way that you, perhaps, would not and cut him more slack. And there's no kid on the planet that wants his mom to rescue him from school.",
        "Cassie: Well, that's tough, because I'm going down to that school. I'm going to find that little punk and his parents, and I'm going give them a talking to.",
        "Josh: Yeah, Cassie? Cassie? I think... I think that's kind of what he's worried about.",
        "Cassie: Oh. Okay, so I'll calm down, and I will be a concerned parent, and not someone who looks like she wants to start a fight herself.",
        "Josh: Okay, all right. I'll go with you, then.",
        "Cassie: No, I can handle it.",
        "Josh: Just, just... just slow down, okay, because I really don't think you want to go out like that. I mean, not that the Daisy Duke outfit doesn't work, but I don't think it's projecting the loving, caring mother that you're looking for.",
        "Cassie: Fine. I'll go change.",
        "Josh: I think that's a fine idea. I'll wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I'd like to hear what that principal has to say about this fight that R.J. supposedly started. I'm going to go find him.",
        "Josh: No, wait, wait. Cassie, just wait a minute. He's going to be here in a minute, I'm sure.",
        "Cassie: I don't want to wait. I hate these offices. Every time... every time child services had to move me to a new foster home, I had to come down. So I...",
        "Josh: Cassie.",
        "Cassie: You don't need to come with me, but I need to get out of here.",
        "Josh: Wait... Cassie, just wait a second. Cassie. Okay.",
        "H.B.: Bring the whole family, huh? In my day, that was a snap. There was just mom and pop and the kids. Now, Lord, it's more complicated than calculus. You got divorce and remarriage and folks living together and others sharing kids on alternate weekends unless it's raining. Hell, you need a scorecard to know who's who and who goes where.",
        "Josh: I got news for you, daddy. I don't think it was ever easy.",
        "Marah: Daddy, we won!",
        "Josh: Yes, we did, darling. We are the fastest family on six feet, don't you think?",
        "Shayne: This trophy is so cool!",
        "Josh: Hey, buddy, how you doing? Let me see, let me see, let me see. First place, family relay. How about that, huh? Come here, come here, come here. I am proud of you, and I am proud of you, and you think I'm smiling real big right now? Look at that. If your mama were here today, her face would light up. She would be smiling just as big if she were here with us.",
        "Marah: It's okay, Daddy. We've got each other.",
        "Josh: I know we do, darling. Give me a kiss. ( Laughs ) come here, come here, come here, come here, come here.",
        "Marah: ( Laughs )",
        "Counselor: Mr. Lewis? I'm Dorothy McCrory, the school counselor.",
        "Josh: I'm sorry, hi. Hi. It's nice to meet you.",
        "Counselor: My secretary mentioned that you'd come along with Mrs. Winslow. I'm glad you did.",
        "Josh: Yeah. Well, you sounded very concerned on the phone. I thought maybe I could help.",
        "Counselor: I hope so. We've got a serious problem with R.J..",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Is that bandage staying put?",
        "R.J.: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: Are you sure? Let me see.",
        "R.J.: Mom, I'm okay.",
        "Cassie: You are not okay. You were hurt.",
        "R.J.: You should see the other guy.",
        "Cassie: What did you say? Honey, honey. You are not to be in fights. You... you are under no circumstances ever to start a fight. Do you understand me?",
        "R.J.: I had to.",
        "Cassie: Why? R.J., why?",
        "R.J.: Because of the volcano.",
        "Cassie: The what?",
        "R.J.: The volcano that I had to build for my science project. I messed it up.",
        "Cassie: Well, you never told me you had a science project. Did you... did you build the volcano at home?",
        "R.J.: I tried. In the barn.",
        "Cassie: Well, why didn't you just ask me for help? What?",
        "R.J.: Like girls know how to build stuff.",
        "Cassie: Excuse me? This girl had a hand in building an entire hotel. I know plenty.",
        "R.J.: About volcanoes?",
        "Cassie: Well, I'm... I'm sure I could figure it out. I'm sure I could build one that would rival Mount St. Helens.",
        "R.J.: Bull.",
        "Cassie: Hey!",
        "R.J.: Dads are supposed to help with this kind of stuff. Not moms. That's why Jason and Malcolm started laughing at me. Because my volcano was lame and I don't have a dad. So I had to hit them! Leave me alone.",
        "Cassie: R.J.. R.J., honey, look at me. Look at me, honey. I'm sorry that those boys made fun of you. I'm sorry that they made you angry. And I wish you did have a dad around. But that's just not the way it is right now, honey. You have me, okay? We have each other.",
        "R.J.: ( Crying )",
        "Cassie: Sweetie, don't forget that, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: R.J. took on two kids? He must have been pretty mad.",
        "Counselor: He was out of control the first few minutes. That's really the only way to describe it. I'm very concerned.",
        "Josh: Look, R.J.'s a good kid. I'm not going to condone fighting here or anything, but if he started throwing punches, he must have had a pretty good reason.",
        "Counselor: This wasn't an isolated event, Mr. Lewis. R.J. has been acting out for the past few months. He clearly craves attention, which fits the profile. It's difficult for a young boy to have his needs met growing up in a broken home.",
        "Josh: Whoa, whoa, whoa. R.J.'s home is not broken, all right? His mother is an incredible woman who would do anything... she's totally dedicated to her children.",
        "Counselor: Still, there's no father.",
        "Josh: I understand that. But, on the other hand, there's no mother who's willing to give more for her children than Cassie.",
        "Counselor: The question is, is it enough?",
        "Josh: Hey, let me tell you something, okay, about Cassie Winslow that's not in your file. From day one, she was dealt a lousy hand. She has two choices, succeed or not succeed, and it was touch or go there for a while as to which it would be. Now, let me just give you one example of her, okay? Her daughter Tammy was placed in a foster home when Cassie was still essentially just a child herself. Now, she could have left her there, but she didn't do that. She was dedicated to raising her child, her daughter, on her own. So she did not take the easy route, because that's not who she is! Cassie gives more to her children than any person I know! And she has never been negligent in any part of their upbringing. Believe me when I say this, she is not just a decent human being and a good mother, she is a wonderful human being. She is one in a million! Why don't you put that in your file?",
        "Counselor: Are you finished?",
        "Josh: Yes, I am! And I think this is the part where you tell me to take a hike.",
        "Counselor: No. This is where I say that I wish that there were more couples who were as committed to their children and to each other as you are to R.J.'s mother. It's obvious that you love Cassie Winslow very much.",
        "Josh: I think there's been a misunderstanding. I... I am not Cassie's...",
        "Counselor: Significant other?",
        "Josh: No. Actually, I'm her brother-in- law.",
        "Counselor: Oh, my goodness.",
        "Josh: Exactly.",
        "Counselor: I'm so sorry, Mr. Lewis.",
        "Josh: We're both blushing, I guess, aren't we?",
        "Counselor: But you can see how I might have been confused... I mean, given the circumstances.",
        "Josh: The circumstances?",
        "Counselor: Well, first, R.J. insists that the school call you, and then you show up with his mother and go on to speak so eloquently in her defense. After all that, I simply assumed that you and Mrs. Winslow were...",
        "Josh: We're not.",
        "Counselor: I see that.",
        "Josh: We are not. I was just trying to...",
        "R.J.: Uncle Josh!",
        "Josh: ...Help you to understand what kind of a woman she really is. There he is! Hey, buddy! Success, huh? You found him.",
        "Cassie: I did.",
        "R.J.: I can't believe you're here.",
        "Josh: Hey, I wouldn't miss it for the world. Besides, this is serious stuff, young man.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, it sure is.",
        "Counselor: Why don't I step out into the hall and give you a couple of minutes alone?",
        "Josh: Thank you. They tell me you started a fight. Is that true?",
        "R.J.: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, some boys were teasing him because they had this science project, and he had to build a model volcano, and...",
        "Josh: Ah.",
        "Cassie: R.J.'s didn't turn out as well as he wanted it to, because he didn't have a father to help him build it the right way.",
        "R.J.: Could you help me, Uncle Josh? Please?",
        "Josh: Well, I could, but you know, your mom, she's a heck of a builder.",
        "Cassie: See?",
        "R.J.: That's what she said.",
        "Cassie: Honey. Your Uncle Josh has a project of his own right now that he's working on.",
        "R.J.: The hospital?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, and it's very important. He's going to help a lot of brave soldiers who are hurt or who are sick. We can't just expect him to drop everything for our project, okay? But don't you worry. I'm going to help you, and we're going to make one together.",
        "R.J.: How? We don't even have a plan.",
        "Josh: Actually, you know, what, I think I can help you with that. I can call Wanda-- you know Wanda-- and ask her if she could go on the web and do some research and find a really cool plan for a volcano, and then I could have her email that to you. How would that be?",
        "Cassie: Well, you see? That'd be great. And then we'd have some tips, and we'd be off and running.",
        "Josh: You could get started right away, maybe even this afternoon.",
        "Cassie: R.J., it'll be fun. I promise.",
        "R.J.: Okay. Thanks for helping, Uncle Josh.",
        "Josh: You're quite welcome, young man.",
        "R.J.: Can I go back to class now?",
        "Cassie: Yes, you can. I'll see you after school. I'm sorry you got dragged into this, Josh.",
        "Josh: No, no, no. Don't be sorry. I mean, I... I'm the one who volunteered to come along, right?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, like you'd ever not come, knowing that R.J. was in need. You've got so much on your plate already, and then you turn around and you give me even more of your time.",
        "Josh: I'm glad to do it.",
        "Cassie: You should go. You've already wasted enough of your day.",
        "Josh: I didn't waste any of my day. And... and listen, if it's that important to R.J., I'd be happy to help him build this thing.",
        "Cassie: No! I am capable of doing this. I am going to help my son with whatever he needs, whether that's a model volcano or a lesson in self-defense or a how- to on shaving.",
        "Josh: Shaving, really? Don't you think you're jumping the gun just a little bit on that?",
        "Cassie: I'm just saying...",
        "Josh: I know what you're saying, Cassie. I'm just trying to tell you that all of these great, wonderful things that you want to do for your son, you don't have to do them alone, okay? You've got me.",
        "Cassie: I got to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Hey, Reva, it's me. I know you're with Jonathan today, so you're probably not answering your phone. But I wanted to let you know that I've decided to put off the trip to Chicago. I... I'll call you back. Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Good memory.",
        "Josh: What are you doing here?",
        "Jonathan: On my way to get a Buzz Burger. What, does a guy need a passport to get into this joint now?",
        "Josh: Well, just... just a second. You see, I was under the impression that you had more pressing business that you had to deal with today.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, man, nothing's more pressing than my next meal when I'm starving, you know what I mean?",
        "Josh: ( Laughs ) That's funny. But Reva, she told me that she was going to help you out with some emergency that you had to deal with, so obviously that's not the case. What's the story?",
        "Jonathan: I don't know what you're talking about, so I will see you later.",
        "Josh: Wait. Come here, come here. See, here's the thing. Reva told me that she had to help out with some situation today, and she and I had plans and she begged off because of that. So... so what's the deal?",
        "Reva: I'm not telling anyone that I'm sick, and neither are you.",
        "Josh: Is Reva lying to me?",
        "Jonathan: No. Reva's... no. She's not lying.",
        "Josh: She's not?",
        "Jonathan: Okay. ( Groans ) You got me. I was lying.",
        "Josh: Really.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. I screwed up again. I just didn't want anybody to know about it.",
        "Josh: Screwed up how?",
        "Jonathan: It doesn't matter. Reva did say something about feeling bad, though.",
        "Josh: She's feeling bad?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, about canceling the plans, you know? So she wanted to get you some kind of gift, like a... a peace offering? But don't tell her I told you. You'll blow the whole surprise, and I'll be back in the doghouse, only with mommy dearest is time.",
        "Josh: Okay, all right. I won't tell her anything about it. And thank you, by the way, for putting my mind at ease. I don't think I've ever said that to you before, have I?",
        "Jonathan: No, no you haven't.",
        "H.B.: That young fellow's a natural-born liar.",
        "Josh: Well, at least he came clean this time.",
        "H.B.: Only to set up a bigger lie. That story of his stunk to high heaven.",
        "Josh: Why would he lie about something like that? What, to give her a cover story? To protect her? That's crazy.",
        "H.B.: There's crazy, and there's crazy, son.",
        "Josh: Hey, I am... I am not going to let anyone make me doubt Reva, and that includes you.",
        "H.B.: But you really could never pin that gal down. She was too wild. That's why I married her and why you fell for her in the first place. Or am I wrong?",
        "Josh: No, you're not wrong. It... did I make a mistake, Daddy? Giving my heart to Reva, again?",
        "H.B.: Oh. Do I think you made a mistake? Never did, never could, never will.",
        "Josh: Have you ever built a volcano?",
        "H.B.: I can't say as I have. I did see Vesuvius once, though. Overrated, if you ask me.",
        "Josh: ( Laughs )",
        "H.B.: Where are you off to?",
        "Josh: I just think every boy needs a father, even if he has to borrow one. You've got to kind of trust me on this, okay? If you let R.J. take that back to his classroom, he's going to get in a worse fight than he was in before.",
        "Cassie: Well, not as bad as the one I'm about to have with you.",
        "Josh: What's the big deal? We're talking about a science project here.",
        "Cassie: One that you seem convinced is beyond my abilities.",
        "Josh: Yeah, well, the proof is in the... did you... I'm sorry, did you actually use vanilla pudding to put this thing together? Is that what that is?",
        "Cassie: That's very funny. I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.",
        "Josh: I... I'm just saying that I have the materials necessary to put something like this together back at Cross Creek. I have the tools, the right tools, okay?",
        "Cassie: And I don't have the right tools? That's the point, right?",
        "Josh: So, just explain to me again why it is that you don't want my help.",
        "Cassie: Because I... I can't keep depending on you every time the tiniest little project crops up in my life!",
        "Josh: That was a tiny little eruption right there, wasn't it?",
        "Cassie: I'm sorry. I am always in such desperate need of a hand.",
        "Josh: No! It's not about you! I'm talking about me! I'm talking about what I need. It's about me being a part of something-- you know, you and R.J., as a part of your family. Something that I would get something out of.",
        "Cassie: And what is it exactly that we could give you?",
        "R.J.: Uncle Josh! You changed your mind. You came to help build the volcano.",
        "Josh: Well, I don't know, R.J.. Maybe so, maybe not. Ask your mom.",
        "Cassie: Hey, two against one is not fair.",
        "Josh: I think that sounded like an \"okay.\" Was that an \"okay\"?",
        "Cassie: Okay.",
        "Josh: ( Laughs )",
        "R.J.: What are we going to do first?",
        "Josh: Well, I think we have to have a clean start. So come with me to Cross Creek and we will build a new volcano.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Goggles on? Ow! Tool belt adjusted? ( Grunts ) Let's build something, my friend. ( Saw buzzing ) Excellent! Now cut that one right there. ( Evil, maniacal laugh ) Let's do another one. Here we go.",
        "R.J.: Okay.",
        "Josh: One more. Here you go. Nice.",
        "Cassie: All right. You must have worked up an appetite by now.",
        "Josh: Okay. We're good here, good here, good here. I think we're ready to start painting, my friend.",
        "R.J.: Good.",
        "Josh: You ready?",
        "R.J.: Yeah!",
        "Josh: Okay. Let's go. You take this one here.",
        "R.J.: It came out just the way you planned!",
        "Josh: The way we planned. Come on, come on. Ah!",
        "Cassie: Oh, my goodness!",
        "Josh: Ah, yes! Come on now, come on, come out! ( Laughs )",
        "Cassie: Wow! That is pretty, pretty darn cool.",
        "Josh: Very nice.",
        "Cassie: What is that in the lava?",
        "Josh: You know what? It's actually a secret. If I were to tell you, I'd have to kill you.",
        "Cassie: Ah.",
        "R.J.: Awesome right?",
        "Cassie: Definitely awesome.",
        "Josh: Thank you.",
        "Cassie: ( Laughs ) Josh, I don't know what to say.",
        "Josh: No, no, no. It wasn't me. R.J. did most of the work.",
        "R.J.: Me?",
        "Josh: Absolutely! Hey, I know a natural-born builder when I see one, and you are a natural-born builder! H.B. would be proud of you.",
        "R.J.: Your dad?",
        "Josh: ( Laughs ) Yes. H.B. was my dad, but he was a whole lot more than that. Come over here. Let's forget about school for just a second. Let me give you a history lesson, all right? H.B. Lewis, he was a cowboy who dreamed big dreams. He sat right here at this desk. Remember, I told you this was the desk? This was his?",
        "R.J.: Uh-huh, yeah?",
        "Josh: Well, he built companies from scratch right here. Lewis Oil. He helped me build Lewis Construction. And at the same time, he built a family.",
        "R.J.: He died, right?",
        "Josh: But his dreams, his dreams are still alive. You know that veterans' project we've been talking about? That was something he dreamed up a long time ago. And I'll tell you about something else that he built that's still standing strong-- this house, right here.",
        "R.J.: Really?",
        "Josh: Yeah, really! He built this house nail by nail, brick by brick. And when he was finished with this house, it was more than just a house. It was a home.",
        "R.J.: What's the difference?",
        "Josh: Well, a house, I mean, a house is just a collection of, I don't know, wood and nails and stones, things like that. But a home, a home is a whole lot more, R.J..",
        "R.J.: I can't wait to take this to school tomorrow.",
        "Cassie: I believe it, because you are going to be a huge hit.",
        "R.J.: Hey, Uncle Josh.",
        "Josh: Yes?",
        "R.J.: Can we take the volcano back to our house tonight?",
        "Josh: Absolutely, we can do that. In fact, we'd better hurry up, because I hear there's a storm coming.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: ( Thunder rumbles ) Wow, okay. I think I'd better go before it starts to rain. You... you let me know how things go tomorrow at school, okay?",
        "R.J.: I will.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Cassie: And what do you say to your Uncle Josh?",
        "R.J.: Thank you very much.",
        "Josh: You are very welcome. Come here! ( Laughs )",
        "R.J.: You know?",
        "Josh: What?",
        "R.J.: This ended up to be one of the best days ever.",
        "Josh: You know what? It's pretty high on my list, too. I'll see you, all right. ( Thunder rumbles ) Whoa, I got to go. I'll call you.",
        "Cassie: All right. Hey, Josh?",
        "Josh: Yeah?",
        "Cassie: I just wanted to thank you again. You took a lousy day and you made it into something wonderful, something my little boy will probably remember the rest of his life.",
        "Josh: I'll tell you a secret. Your little boy is not so little anymore.",
        "Cassie: ( Laughs )",
        "Josh: But the truth is, he did the same thing for me. You both did. ( Thunder rumbles )",
        "Cassie: ( Gasps ) Oh, jeez. Sorry.",
        "Josh: ( Laughs )",
        "Cassie: Just a little jumpy. ( Laughs )",
        "Josh: You okay? It's okay, just a little summer storm. No one's going to get hurt.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. ( Laughs )",
        "Josh: So, I'll go. I have to go. I'll see you later.",
        "Cassie: Thank you again.",
        "Josh: Yeah, you know what? You keep saying that.",
        "Cassie: Well, I keep meaning it.",
        "Josh: You're quite welcome. I'll see you around. ( Thunder rumbles ) I was... I was trying to, you know, kiss you on the cheek.",
        "Cassie: I... I... I know.",
        "R.J.: Mom?",
        "H.B.: Just a summer storm, huh? Say Josh, did you hear the one about the man who got what he wished for?",
        "Josh: No, I didn't. What happened to him?",
        "H.B.: I was hoping you'd tell me. ( Thunder rumbles )",
