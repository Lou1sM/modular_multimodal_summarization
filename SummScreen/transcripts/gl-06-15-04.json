        "Cassie: Edmund, I've been looking for you.",
        "Edmund: Cassie...",
        "Cassie: Okay, okay, okay. You're angry with me. I mean, you're angrier than you probably ever thought you could be. I accused you of being a drug dealer. It's so ridiculous, it's funny.",
        "Edmund: Well, it's ridiculous at any rate.",
        "Cassie: You were so angry with me that you left the party before I got a chance to thank you. What you did tonight was amazing. You raised more money for the San Cristobel children museum than anyone ever has.",
        "Edmund: That was the idea.",
        "Cassie: I'm just so glad that you're here and that we can have... you're leaving?",
        "Edmund: That is also the idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Yes, Miss Lewis, my name is Joshua Lewis. I'm your husband. I would appreciate it if you would call me back. Or better yet show up, because I'm worried about you. And you know, when I'm worried about you I'm not really at my best. So I'm at the bar right now and I'm going to drink until you show up. I love you. Good-bye. Could I have a martini, please? Vodka, straight up. Thank you.",
        "Tammy: Uncle Josh.",
        "Josh: Tammy.",
        "Tammy: I just don't know what to do.",
        "Josh: Hi. Well, okay. I'll tell you what. Why don't you sit down with me for a minute? I'll buy you a soda and we can talk, okay? Go ahead.",
        "Tammy: Where's Aunt Reva?",
        "Josh: Well, don't worry about Aunt Reva. Just go ahead, have a seat. What do you got there?",
        "Tammy: Tickets to the summer fling. I'm supposed to be going with Joey, but something happened and he left them for me with a note that basically says he doesn't want to go with me anymore. I can't take this, uncle josh. What am I going to do?",
        "Reva: So when I saw Danny coming up behind Salerno, I knew everything was going to be okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Salerno: I should have known about you, Danny. You turned your own mother in. What chance did I have?",
        "Danny: You were reckless, Vinnie. You were going down one way or another.",
        "Salerno: Well, tell you something. Whether I'm free or in the slam, I'm going to spend the rest of my days figuring out ways to hurt you and your family.",
        "Danny: Yeah? That works both ways. You think I can't get to you in jail?",
        "Jeffrey: That's enough. That's enough, Danny. Tony Santos, glad you're here. Tony Santos, you're under arrest for conspiracy to distribute illegal drugs.",
        "Tony: (Laughs) you're serious, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Cooper! Cooper, I could use an update.",
        "Alan: Gus, is something going on upstairs?",
        "Alexandra: Is this about brad?",
        "Gus: He what? He what? How did that happen? What happened? What happened?",
        "Harley: He's gone. Lauren Anderson and Craig Shand",
        "Gus: What happened? Tell me what happened?",
        "Harley: I approached Brad Green with his suitcase full of money. The agent attempted to take the suitcase, brad resisted, he clutched his chest, he fell to the ground.",
        "Alexandra: Is... is Brad dead?",
        "Harley: He got away with it.",
        "Gus: What do you mean, he got away?",
        "Harley: He got away with it. He... he was the center of the drug ring and like the snake that he is; he managed to get away without paying.",
        "Gus: He's dead. He's dead, Coop, come on.",
        "Harley: Really? Well, how many people are dead from those drugs?",
        "Gus: You all right? Hm? We lost contact.",
        "Harley: Yeah, I know. My mike was working, it wasn't working. I'm sorry I was off-line.",
        "Gus: It's all right, it's all right. Just tell me what happened.",
        "Harley: He resisted. He was freaking out. I mean, that's weird. With this guy's money? Call your lawyer, get out on bail, you know what I mean? But he went crazy. And I'm sorry that I said what I said. I mean, certainly I wanted this thing over, but I never saw it ending like this.",
        "Gus: Neither did I. Neither did I.",
        "Harley: \"I don't want to go alone.\" That's the last thing he said to me. \"Not alone.\" So I feel like... I don't know, all that matters in the end is who you love and how much they love you, because otherwise, you're lying on the floor like Brad Green clutching your money, but you are all alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Jeffrey, don't do this. Tony tried to help me.",
        "Jeffrey: Reva, please stay out of this. Tony's in this, just like everyone else.",
        "Salerno: Antonio, don't worry about it. My lawyer will have us out in the morning.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, yeah? Good luck with that.",
        "Tony: Reva, don't sweat it, okay? Some of us got out, and some of us didn't. It's all right.",
        "Salerno: Danny stabbed you in the back, Tony, just like he did me.",
        "Tony: You know what, Vinnie? You should have listened to me when this thing was getting out of control in the first place, all right?",
        "Salerno: Because you knew this was going down?",
        "Tony: Oh, yeah, I did. That's right. That's why I got cuffs on!",
        "Jeffrey: That's enough, ladies. You can argue about this when you're in your cells. Now get them out of here. They're ready for processing.",
        "Tony: You mind if I say something to my cousin first?",
        "Jeffrey: Go.",
        "Tony: Is that okay with you? Thank you, Jeffrey. All's well that ends well, right?",
        "Danny: Take it easy, take it easy. You're immune. You just sit tight.",
        "Tony: It better happen.",
        "Salerno: You're a good actor, Daniel, but you know what they say about sincerity? Once you fake it, you've got it made. Nobody is ever going to believe you again-- not your wife, your family, nobody. And you can bet they're not going to hold me.",
        "Danny: Yeah, Vinnie? Try coming after me. See what happens.",
        "Salerno: Oh, I'll do more than try.",
        "Jeffrey: Sorry about Tony.",
        "Danny: Yeah, you just keep your end of the deal and make sure he gets his immunity.",
        "Jeffrey: Wait, where are you going? We need your statement.",
        "Danny: Get it later. I'm going to go see my wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Excuse me.",
        "Cassie: Edmund, you cannot leave.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, we both know I have to.",
        "Cassie: No, you're doing this just to punish me.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, the fact that that thought even entered your head is...",
        "Cassie: Oh, stop being righteous and hurt, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I'm not trying to be righteous and...",
        "Cassie: We haven't even sat down and talked about this.",
        "Edmund: I'm sorry, I thought we had.",
        "Cassie: I hurt you. I hurt you terribly. I mean, I doubted you and I should have shared my doubts with you.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I'm well aware of what happened.",
        "Cassie: And I have never wanted to take something back more in my entire life.",
        "Edmund: But you can't, Cassie. You can't. And so we have to deal with what's happening now. More importantly, we have to deal with what's going on underneath of all of this, what neither one of us has dared to say.",
        "Cassie: I have never faked my love for you, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: I know that.",
        "Cassie: It's not like I'm stuffing down all these thoughts or feelings about you that I'm afraid to say to you.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, you have never hidden anything from me, and that's my point.",
        "Cassie: Okay, well, if I've never hidden anything from you, then what are you talking about?",
        "Edmund: It's the thoughts and feelings you don't know you have that I'm talking about, thoughts you've been denying for I don't know how long.",
        "Cassie: What are you saying?",
        "Edmund: Cassie... (Sighs) the way you have responded to things over the last several days, especially tonight with the doubts, with the feelings, I'm saying that maybe it all just came naturally.",
        "Cassie: Don't... don't say that, Edmund, because I know how I feel and I know what I'm thinking and I know who you are, okay?",
        "Edmund: You know who I am?",
        "Cassie: Yes!",
        "Edmund: Good. I'm glad you know who I am, Cassie, but that doesn't mean you've forgotten the man I used to be, and that man, what he... what I did to you back then-- me, Cassie-- what I did is fresh on your mind.",
        "Cassie: No, it's not. That's not true.",
        "Edmund: If that's not true, Cassie, then why were you so quick to assume that I was a drug dealer? Assume it, Cassie-- you were convinced. You were convinced I was a drug dealer. And why? Because the memory of who I was, of the man I used to be, is fresh on your mind.",
        "Cassie: It's who you used to be, Edmund. You're not that person anymore.",
        "Edmund: Well, that's what I would like to think, but it doesn't matter now. I could stay, and we could try to get past this very ugly episode in our lives as best we could, but I think we would both be lying awake at night wondering when it would happen again.",
        "Cassie: No, no, I wouldn't. I swear, I wouldn't, Edmund. I wouldn't.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, you'd try to forget, you would... you would bend over backwards trying to think the best of me. You would. You'd put blinders on and it just...",
        "Cassie: Oh, god. Stop it, okay? So it would be hard, yes. And you know what, Edmund? It would be hard, because I do remember. I do remember what you did to me. And if I think about it too long, I get angry and I get hurt. But you know what? I don't care. I don't care because my love for you-- how much I love you, Edmund, right here and right now-- just wipes everything off the map. And you know what, Edmund? You deserve it. You deserve it. And I choose to give you my love. And you better take it. When you feel...",
        "Cassie: Edmund, please stop. Please. I love you so much, Edmund. Please don't do this.",
        "Edmund: I love you, Cassie. I do.",
        "Cassie: Then how can you just walk out?",
        "Edmund: I don't see that I have a choice.",
        "Cassie: What are you trying to do? Save me? To protect me from not doubting you again?",
        "Edmund: Cassie...",
        "Cassie: It doesn't work that way, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: The doubt was already in your mind. It just took a series of events to bring it out.",
        "Cassie: We love each other. We trust each other. We have been through so much together. Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, Cassie, Cassie. I was a broken man and I had nothing...",
        "Cassie: Oh, stop! Stop! Stop talking like that! All I want to do is wake up in the morning and roll over and be in your arms and make love with you, and to know that my life is better just because you're in it.",
        "Edmund: You don't have to say that, Cassie. You don't owe me anything.",
        "Cassie: Oh, yes I do owe you, Edmund!",
        "Edmund: Cassie, you don't owe me your loyalty, you don't owe me your honesty.",
        "Cassie: I do owe you, Edmund. I hurt you. But you know what? That's a blip compared to how much we mean to each other.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, it's not a blip. It's real. It's what's really inside of you. It's what you're really thinking about me, and you're not realizing it.",
        "Cassie: That's the best you can come up with, Edmund? Because you're going to have to come up with something better than that if you're going to walk out on me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Hi. Oh! Hi, honey. (Laughs) you scared me.",
        "Josh: You're here.",
        "Reva: Yes.",
        "Josh: Where have you been?",
        "Reva: Not dancing the night away with you.",
        "Josh: Yes, yes, I'm very much aware of that.",
        "Reva: Can you get me a drink?",
        "Josh: I can, yes. Excuse me. Excuse me. Could we have another one of these, please? Thank you. You know, I was angry with you earlier and then I got worried about you, but then I thought to myself, \"No, wait a minute. We're talking about Reva here. She's an adult. She can take care of herself.\" Then I thought to myself, \"wait a minute, we're talking about Reva here, and anything could happen.\" And then I thought to myself, \"No, we're past all that weird stuff, and right now our life is just sort of humming along,\" you know? We're just sort of humming.",
        "Reva: That's right, we're humming.",
        "Josh: We're humming. So I spent most of the night watching Shayne and Marina dance.",
        "Reva: I'm sorry I missed that.",
        "Josh: Yeah, you should be. It was a lovely thing. I mean, considering the fact that we weren't sure if he was ever going to walk again and there he was dancing, and it was really one of the best times I've ever had on a dance floor. Of course, I would have had a better time if I had been dancing with my wife. So, where were you? If you want to take a minute and think about the answer to that question, I can fill you in on the rest of the events of the night.",
        "Reva: Do I have a choice?",
        "Josh: Not really, no. First of all, I was stood up, but you know that. And then Cassie and Edmund had a big fight. I don't know what that was about. And then Tammy came walking in here in tears and I got the chance to be, you know, the comforting uncle.",
        "Reva: Really? What's wrong with Tammy?",
        "Josh: Boy trouble. Like her mom.",
        "Reva: Well, boys do cause trouble, don't they?",
        "Josh: Yeah. Is that what you were dealing with tonight? Boy trouble?",
        "Reva: Not until you're finished.",
        "Josh: Okay. Brad Green, works for Spaulding Enterprises, had a heart attack. That was interesting. He apparently was involved in some kind of drug thing and he was busted by Gus and Harley, and the only way he could avoid a life sentence, or life in general, was to die of a massive coronary.",
        "Reva: Well, you know, now you're moving into my territory.",
        "Josh: I don't follow.",
        "Reva: Why I was late.",
        "Josh: Bartender?",
        "Reva: (Laughs)",
        "Josh: Please?",
        "Reva: My evening tonight was more like an \"e\" ride, I'm sure.",
        "Josh: It couldn't have possibly been more exciting than mine.",
        "Reva: Well, unless you take into account the fact that Vinnie Salerno, the mob kingpin, basically kidnapped me.",
        "Josh: Kidnapped you?",
        "Reva: Right out in front of this hotel.",
        "Josh: Oh, my.",
        "Reva: Forced me to go back to his social club with him, where he told me he wanted me to be his personal psychic, whether I wanted to do it or not. And then he reminded me what he could possibly do to you or my kids or me if I refused. A gun was involved, so who was I to say no?",
        "Josh: A gun?",
        "Reva: Well, it was all right, though, really, because I was able to convince him that I sensed that there were no bullets in the gun. That gave Danny room to come in, tackle him to the floor, and then the cops came in, Jeffrey O'Neill came in. Vinnie Salerno is on his way to jail. Of course, then again, Tony is, too, which I really don't think is fair because he tried to save my life earlier in the evening.",
        "Josh: You know what? You need this more than I do.",
        "Reva: You're probably right. Cheers.",
        "Josh: Salerno, he wanted to hire you to do what?",
        "Reva: To predict good and bad days to whack guys and knock over banks.",
        "Josh: Sounds like good work if you can get it.",
        "Reva: Absolutely. Bartender? Can you make those drinks doubles, please? Thanks.",
        "Josh: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Honey? It's over. We did it. O'Neill has everything he needs to put Salerno away for life. He's not going to bother us anymore. Michelle, did you hear me? It's safe for you to come back. Honey? Please come back. Come back.",
        "Rick: Danny? Danny? The nurse said that you would be here.",
        "Danny: Yeah. I just wanted to see how she was doing.",
        "Rick: No change.",
        "Danny: No. Not yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Did he say anything else before he dropped dead?",
        "Harley: I didn't catch it all.",
        "Gus: Confession?",
        "Harley: Well, he didn't shout \"I'm guilty,\" but yeah, he knew he was caught.",
        "Gus: Did he say anything else?",
        "Harley: What did he say? He said... he was crying out to god. He said something about being free.",
        "Gus: Free? Of what?",
        "Harley: His guilt. I don't know. He was losing consciousness. He was delirious.",
        "Gus: And something about alone?",
        "Harley: Yeah. I guess he meant he just didn't have any friends or family here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Harley is right. The man was alone in his life. Every action he took divided him from his friends, his family, and even, in the end, his business associates.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, what have we got? I heard most of it on the radio. A heart attack? That's the way it looks right now. All right. Get this money off the ground and tag it for evidence. This body goes directly to the coroner, okay? Tell Dr. Bauer to check for anything unusual, not to assume anything.",
        "Agent #1: Sir?",
        "Jeffrey: And tell him to call me personally as soon as he's got this body open on a slab.",
        "Alan: Ever the warm-hearted public servant. The man's dead.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, the man who was using your business as a front for running drugs, is that right?",
        "Alan: Yes, a very bad apple in an otherwise very clean company.",
        "Jeffrey: Right. Well, tell your spin doctors good luck with that one. Okay, they briefed me on the way over. What have we got? You got anything else?",
        "Harley: Brad was definitely our man. I watched him go down to the cellar where Gus got a clear view of him picking up the case full of money and exiting. So we've got him on the drop-off and we've got him on the cash pick-up.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Anything else. Did Brad Green give us anything before he died?",
        "Harley: He was crying out to god, so I guess even drug dealers feel like they deserve redemption.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, so you saw Brad Green pick up the money. Did you see anything else that we need to know, Gus?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coming up on \"Guiding Light\"",
        "Reva: But he loves you. You're the best thing that's ever happened to him. Why would he leave?",
        "Cassie: Because I wasn't smart enough to love him the way he loves me.",
        "Edmund: Your mother and I are having some problems and I think it's probably best that I move back to my suite in towers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Thank you.",
        "Gus: Don't.",
        "Alan: Gus...",
        "Gus: Don't. I haven't done anything yet, okay?",
        "Alan: You kept your mouth shut, and you could have handed Alexandra over to the D.A, but you didn't.",
        "Gus: I haven't done anything yet. Okay?",
        "Alan: We're at the end of the line, here. Brad Green is the only person that could have implicated Alexandra.",
        "Gus: Well, I guess it's a good thing he's dead, isn't it?",
        "Alan: Yes, it is. We both agree on that.",
        "Gus: We'd agree on it if we both wanted the same thing. I did not get involved in this operation to protect my aunt.",
        "Alan: But you were planning on protecting me, weren't you?",
        "Gus: I don't know. What were you doing in the basement?",
        "Alan: I told you, I was keeping an eye on my sister.",
        "Gus: Maybe you were her partner. How do I know?",
        "Alan: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Are you accusing me?",
        "Gus: What were you doing in the basement?",
        "Alan: I told you. My sister was in trouble and I thought she was being squeezed by Brad Green. Let me tell you one thing, she is not a drug dealer. I know that. Why ever she was covering for Brad Green, she had no choice.",
        "Gus: You should have fixed this. You should have... what is the point of having the money and the power that you have if you let a man like him walk all over you? You should have fixed it. You should have stopped it but you didn't, right? Because stopping it would have meant you would have had to show that you knew what was going on and you could do that, because that would make you an accessory.",
        "Alan: Wait. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Tell me something: Are you planning on turning your own father in?",
        "Gus: Oh, do not start with this.",
        "Alan: Answer me a question. You do love me, don't you? I mean, you have a home with me, with us. We're not perfect people. We're Spaulding's. We live very big lives, Gus.",
        "Gus: What is this? What does that mean? Is that a family motto or something? Do whatever you want, say whatever you want, but you're a Spaulding so you get away with it? Is that what you're saying?",
        "Alan: It means when you're in our class, normal rules don't apply to you. We help our own, we protect our own, and we punish our own.",
        "Gus: What do you want me to do? You want me to give my aunt a little slap on the wrist?",
        "Alan: No, no, no, no, no. She is going to suffer, believe me. But it is time now for you to step up, step up and take your rightful place in this family and do what is right.",
        "Gus: I suppose you want me to find away to get her off the hook or something?",
        "Alan: No, no, no, no. Just think about family. Think how important it is to have a family. What good would it do to put her in jail? You have your man. What else do you have to prove, Gus?",
        "Gus: I am not trying to prove anything.",
        "Alan: Then you will have no problem in doing what is right, son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You're running away. That's what you're doing.",
        "Edmund: I'm not running away. This is not running away, Cassie. I'm not running away.",
        "Cassie: Yes you are, because you're hurt. But you know what? That's not good enough. It's not. Because I have been more than hurt by someone standing here in this room, and you know what? Here I am. I'm not going anywhere. And if you stand here and you say that you don't deserve to be with me, I'm going to hit you. And I will. You have to know I regret what I did. And I'm not going to lose you over one mistake. And you have to be big enough to understand that something like this was going to happen.",
        "Edmund: And I've been fooling myself because I thought it never would. I thought... I thought your love would save me. I thought your forgiveness was enough. I thought...",
        "Cassie: I never lied to you. I have never lied to you, Edmund. I'm going to go downstairs, and I want you to stay here and I want you to look around this room. And I want you to remember the joy and the happiness and true passion that we experienced in this room. And then you tell me how you can just walk away.",

        "Josh: Well, that was quite a night.",
        "Reva: Yes. Yes, it was, and I say that we should probably go home and tuck ourselves into bed. What do you think?",
        "Josh: I think I'm glad you're safe. Were you scared at all?",
        "Reva: A little.",
        "Josh: Okay. Let's go home and have a night of peace and quiet.",
        "Reva: I love that idea.",
        "Josh: (Chuckles) right after we deal with this family crisis.",
        "Reva: What is it?",
        "Cassie: I lost him. I fought as hard as I could, I opened my heart as wide as it would go, but it didn't work, Reva. Edmund's leaving.",
        "Reva: But he loves you. You're the best thing that's ever happened to him. Why would he leave?",
        "Cassie: Because I wasn't smart enough to love him the way he loves me.",
        "Reva: Oh, honey.",
        "Cassie: I don't know why I'm sitting here talking to you guys about this because I know you've wanted this to happen all along.",
        "Reva: Cassie, all I've ever wanted was for you to be loved the way you deserve to be loved.",
        "Cassie: But I know you never believe that Edmund and I belong together.",
        "Reva: You know, it doesn't matter what I believed-- or believe. Because Edmund and... no. I'm not going to say it. I'm going to excuse myself before I say something I really regret. Joshua, you talk to her.",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Reva: Well, you've been rescuing damsels in distress all evening. So here, take another shot.",
        "Josh: Wait a minute. Reva, what... (Sighs)",
        "Cassie: Sorry.",
        "Josh: No, no, no. Don't... don't be sorry. Okay. I'm guessing that you can understand why Reva has a hard time with you and Edmund.",
        "Cassie: Yes, I do. Josh...",
        "Josh: I think she just wants the best for you, I really do. And you may not know this, but my family had a tough time with me and Reva being together at first. You know, they thought she was going to ruin my life, go figure.",
        "Cassie: So you understand.",
        "Josh: No, I don't. Because I don't know that I like Edmund a whole lot more than Reva does, but I will say this for him: He's trying hard to change and he's doing that for you. And I'll tell you one more thing.",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Josh: If Edmund ever does anything to harm you, Billy and I will hurt him. So, having said that, I'm listening.",
        "Cassie: I just feel like Edmund was looking for a reason to leave.",
        "Josh: I don't think so. He loves you. Anyone can see that.",
        "Cassie: Well, apparently our love isn't strong enough.",
        "Josh: You know what? We need to step back and just take another look at this, okay? Just for a minute. I think Edmund is different for you than any other man you've been with in your life.",
        "Cassie: What? Is it because of his past? Things he's done to me? Then you sound just like him or Reva.",
        "Josh: No, no, no. That's not the point I'm trying to make. It's not because he's... it's not because of his past. It's because you chose him. I mean, think about it, just for a minute, okay? Every other man in your life has come after you. Richard romanced you. Hart had Dinah in his life, but he wanted you in his life, so he made that happen.",
        "Cassie: What are you getting at?",
        "Josh: Every other man has romanced you in some way. Edmund wasn't looking for romance, certainly not with you. I mean, if anything, he was ready to spend the rest of his life feeling guilty where you were concerned. But you opened up your heart and your life to him. You went after him. You picked Edmund in the same way that I picked Reva. You may not know it yet, but you're not going to let that go. You're not going to give up on that. You're going to fight for that to the end.",
        "Cassie: How do I fight if he's not here, josh?",
        "Josh: Cassie, you never know. I mean, maybe you got through to him upstairs. I'm guessing whatever you said to him, you said from your heart, and he's going to respond to that. But even if you fell short, you're not going to let it go. You're not going to give up, because you don't have it in you.",
        "Cassie: Then why do I feel like I've already lost him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Hey, guys. I just wanted to say good night. Oh, hi, Edmund. Where's mom?",
        "Edmund: Downstairs, I think.",
        "Tammy: What's up? Are you going somewhere? Edmund, what is wrong?",
        "Edmund: Tammy, I think it's probably best if your mother talked to you about this.",
        "Tammy: Whatever it is, you can tell me.",
        "Edmund: Well, your mother and I have... your mother and I am having some problems and I think it's probably best that I move back to my suite in towers.",
        "Tammy: What? But how could... you just had this big party tonight. You raised all that money for mom's museum in San Cristobel. I mean, what could have happened since...",
        "Edmund: Tammy, Tammy, I want you to know that wherever I am, I will always be there for you and your brothers no matter what. I will. And I think... I think that maybe your mother will be best to help you to understand.",
        "Tammy: No, no. You make me understand. You explain to me why everybody has to leave. Why?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: So, I was trying to get Reva away from Salerno and he just whacked me from behind.",
        "Rick: What happened to Reva?",
        "Danny: She's fine. She managed to get away from him.",
        "Rick: Did the police shoot this guy?",
        "Danny: No, no, no. Rick, really, I'm fine. It's okay. No, I came to and got Vinnie to the floor and the cops came in and busted him.",
        "Rick: So this makes sense now. The night that Michelle came over, she was upset about something but she wouldn't tell me what it was.",
        "Danny: Everybody kind of thought that was about me buying the election.",
        "Rick: So you didn't buy it?",
        "Danny: No, Rick, I didn't.",
        "Rick: What, you're upset that I could possibly think that you might do something like that?",
        "Danny: It would have been nice to have been given the benefit of the doubt, all right?",
        "Rick: You know, for my sister's sake, Danny, I really wanted to believe in you, but fortunately I know your track record well enough to know that you couldn't possibly change.",
        "Danny: Well, thanks for keeping up with the charade.",
        "Rick: Come on, please. All this stuff that you've been into.",
        "Danny: \"Stuff\" that I've been into?",
        "Rick: Do you have a normal life? Do you have a normal job? Do you come home at night to see your children? Do you keep your wife safe from death threats and warehouse explosions, Danny?",
        "Danny: Rick, I'm not going to fight with you.",
        "Rick: I'm not fighting with you; I'm just stating fact.",
        "Danny: Anyway, no, I did not buy the election. It was a cover so that I could cooperate with O'Neill and the feds.",
        "Rick: Cooperate. You cooper... did the feds make you cooperate?",
        "Danny: Does it really matter?",
        "Rick: No, it doesn't matter.",
        "Danny: Michelle and I were just trying to do the right thing. It really doesn't matter if I don't get her back.",
        "Rick: You put my little sister right smack in the middle of harm's way once again, Danny.",
        "Danny: Rick, if you're blaming me...",
        "Rick: I blame you for putting her into a coma. Who else could I possibly blame? I've got work to do.",
        "Danny: Rick? Is there any change in her prognosis?",
        "Rick: She'll come back to us. We've just got to give it some time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Hey. I hope you don't mind. I came by to see how she's doing.",
        "Gus: Is this what I have to look forward to every time I deal with you, every time I turn around?",
        "Alan: Look, I realize this is a tough choice, Gus. Just remember, though, you are a part of this family.",
        "Gus: Don't play me, Alan!",
        "Alan: I'm not playing you. I am your father. Let me ask you a question. What would you do if all this happened to me instead of Alexandra?",
        "Gus: What kind of question is that?",
        "Alan: Well, I guess it's not a fair question, but you see, I'm desperate. Because Alexandra is my Eden. Now, didn't you do everything you could to protect your sister? Even when you found out she wasn't blood, you watched over her like a grumpy angel. Gus, if you would protect me, couldn't you protect my sister? Your aunt?",
        "Gus: Man, it is true you cannot choose your family in this life.",
        "Alan: No, you can't. You're stuck with us. And that makes you responsible because we deserve whatever we can do to help each other.",
        "Gus: But I... see, I think you should draw the line someplace, like maybe at drug dealing, you know what I'm saying?",
        "Alan: Brad Green is the key here. He is the one that twisted arms and made up this scheme. All Alexandra is guilty of is not figuring out how to get out of it.",
        "Gus: Please.",
        "Alan: She should not go to prison.",
        "Gus: She is a big girl. She knows what she's doing. She knows all the risks, okay, and she knows all the angles, too. Believe me.",
        "Alan: Until now.",
        "Gus: I don't believe that. I'm sorry.",
        "Alan: It doesn't matter. I know you've suffered and you're suffering a lot through all of this. I want you to know, Gus, I am very proud of you. I am proud to call you a son. You are a part of me. And never forget, son, you are a Spaulding.",
        "Josh: Everything is going to work out, Cassie. I mean, maybe you did make a mistake, I don't know, but with all the mistakes I've made in the last 18 months, the fact that Reva has forgiven me for those... I think Edmund should be waiting for you in the room with a bouquet of roses.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Any change?",
        "Danny: No.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, there was some good luck tonight at least, hm? And it was a long time in coming, and well, we couldn't have done it without you, Danny.",
        "Danny: You mean without forcing me to.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I prefer not to look at it that way.",
        "Danny: That's convenient for you.",
        "Jeffrey: Danny, we've been down this road before. I'm so sorry about Michelle. But you were calling the shots all along.",
        "Danny: What does that mean?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, we would have never gotten the breaks we got if it wasn't for you. You opened every door for us.",
        "Danny: Well, I hope this means that you're done with me, because if I never see you again, it will be too soon.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I just wanted you to know that you have the thanks of a grateful government, that's all.",
        "Danny: Well, that means the world to me. Just keep your end of the bargain. Make sure that Tony gets immunity.",
        "Jeffrey: Just want do to whatever I can, you know?",
        "Danny: Really? Can you bring Michelle back?",
        "Jeffrey: No.",
        "Danny: Can you make up for the time my son has lost with his parents? Can you promise me that we'll all be safe while Salerno is plotting away in prison?",
        "Jeffrey: I could just offer you the deal we offered Eden.",
