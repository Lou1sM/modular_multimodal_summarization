        "Blake: There you are.",
        "Cassie: Hi.",
        "Blake: I was knocking at your front door forever and nobody answered.",
        "Cassie: Oh. I'm sorry. What's up?",
        "Blake: A party for you at the Towers, so I hear.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. It was Edmund's idea. Should be fun, right?",
        "Blake: Well, I came to see if you needed anything. You know, any help getting ready or anything.",
        "Cassie: You know, this barn has a lot of memories. I married Edmund right here.",
        "Blake: You almost died because of him right there, too.",
        "Cassie: We're starting over, Blake. We are. There's a baby coming. A new life on the way means a new life for us.",
        "Blake: You make your future sound like a greeting card, but you don't sound all that happy about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: The idea here is to make my wife happy, blissfully happy, which means more flowers, more candles, more everything. She has to remember this night for the rest of her life, which means everything has to be perfect.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: You don't have to do this, Cassie?",
        "Cassie: Go to the party?",
        "Blake: Or go back to Edmund.",
        "Cassie: Yes, I do have to.",
        "Blake: You have to?",
        "Cassie: Edmund can give me and my kids everything that we've ever wanted.",
        "Blake: Why does everything out of your mouth sound like it's a prepared statement?",
        "Cassie: It is an amazing gift to be given so much, okay? And I am not going to get that with...",
        "Blake: With what? With who?",
        "Cassie: I'm not going to get that with anybody else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: And I've been a loner wandering endlessly and I've been a real gentleman in the high society and I know I'm wasting time if opportunity were on my mind all my life I go the other way I know that's right...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: The booze has really knocked you out, hasn't it? You know something? Tomorrow morning, you're going to wake up and your head's going to be pounding like a pile driver and that's the bad news. The good news is that you're not going to remember anything you said to me tonight. Not that I'll forget it. You sleep tight. Don't let the health inspector bite.",
        "Nate: ( Mumbles ) I'll get up.",
        "Reva: Oh, hey, hey, hey. It's okay. It's okay.",
        "Nate: No, over there. It's over there.",
        "Reva: No, I'm here. I'm right here. Hey, Nate. Nate. You were having a nightmare. Just a bad dream.",
        "Nate: Oh. Oh, Reva. Lord, I am so glad you're still here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: What are you doing?",
        "Jonathan: My job. What are you doing? Playing spy?",
        "Tammy: Do I need to be?",
        "Jonathan: Chill, Tam-Tam. You're not the only one who needs to work overtime around here.",
        "Tammy: I don't remember Josh asking you to work late tonight.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. All right, you got me. I broke into here, busted open that drawer and stole the security codes to the bank accounts, wrote them down on this piece of paper.",
        "Tammy: What? Why?",
        "Jonathan: Well, because it's kind of hard to run the company into the dirt if you don't have access to the computer records. I want to gut Lewis. Leave them road kill. Come on, get it. You got me. Are you satisfied?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Everything's fine, Blake. It is. Everything is great, okay?",
        "Edmund: I thought I heard voices. Hello, Blake. Cassie, you look beautiful. Ready to go?",
        "Cassie: Yes, I am.",
        "Blake: I'll see you over there.",
        "Cassie: Okay.",
        "Edmund: Excuse me.",
        "Cassie: A little Winslow family trivia. Nearly six months to the day we were married.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, we're rededicating ourselves to one another, and that is far too important not to mark with a celebration more memorable than our wedding.",
        "Dinah: Don't worry, Edmund. Trust me. None of us will forget what happens at the bash tonight.",
        "Dinah: Hey, guys. Getting ready for the big night out?",
        "Edmund: You know, Dinah, you needn't go to the party if you're uncomfortable with it.",
        "Cassie: I think she should come. I do. She's carrying our child, and I think that makes her as much a part of our new life as we are.",
        "Dinah: Thank you, Cassie. That's very sweet.",
        "Cassie: And since we are starting over, I want you to have this.",
        "Dinah: What's this?",
        "Cassie: Just something. Open it up.",
        "Dinah: It's beautiful.",
        "Edmund: That's very generous of you, Cassie.",
        "Dinah: It's beautiful. Look at this. Would you mind?",
        "Edmund: Of course, of course, of course.",
        "Dinah: Wow. I'm going to treasure this forever. I'm going to treasure both of you. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Why do you want to hang out here and drink some beer when you can be with me tonight and break up Cassie and Edmund for good?",
        "Jeffrey: Break up Cassie...? You know, you need a new opening line, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: I need you to crash a party with me.",
        "Jeffrey: I don't like to go where I'm not wanted.",
        "Dinah: Even if the party is for Cassie?",
        "Jeffrey: Especially if it's for Cassie. Besides, I've got a little party of my own going on here, if you know what I mean.",
        "Dinah: Please, come on. You're dying to know what I've got planned for tonight.",
        "Jeffrey: Look, you've got Cassie's baby inside of you and now you want to steal Edmund, too.",
        "Dinah: Cassie doesn't want Edmund. Deep down inside, she does not trust Edmund anymore.",
        "Jeffrey: Whatever. You know? I don't care anymore. She's made her choice. Do I like it? No, I hate it. But I'm not going to wait for her to come to her senses anymore.",
        "Dinah: Well, that is just it. I am going to knock her back into her senses, and I think you need to see it.",
        "Jeffrey: ( Sighs )",
        "Groupie: Jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, Hi.",
        "Groupie: I've been waiting.",
        "Jeffrey: I know.",
        "Dinah: Excuse me, we're having a conversation here, so if you don't mind... leave us alone.",
        "Jeffrey: There's those people skills.",
        "Dinah: Oh, please. What do you care? You're taken, or at least you will be soon. Count on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Very funny. Security codes. This is a list of girls' names and their telephone numbers.",
        "Jonathan: It is? Oh, yeah. That's what I was doing. A little talent search.",
        "Tammy: You know what? I think I want to check and make sure that those security codes are still in the drawer where Uncle Josh put them. Just to make sure.",
        "Sandy: Drop what you're doing, gorgeous. We're out of here.",
        "Josh: That's right and that's an order because there's a party being thrown right now for your mom and Edmund, and we've been invited, which means we basically have to go.",
        "Jonathan: Where is it?",
        "Sandy: Towers. But...",
        "Jonathan: What? Oh. I get it. This is a family thing, only the whole family's not invited. Aunt Cassie and Uncle Edmund wanted a certain member of the clan to stay away?",
        "Tammy: Uncle Josh, shouldn't Jonathan...",
        "Jonathan: No, no, it's cool. I don't want to go suck down champagne with the guy who tried to off me when I was a baby. You go, though. Have fun. I've got to print out the Oklahoma leads, anyway, so... you trust me holding down the fort by myself, right?",
        "Josh: If I didn't trust you, you wouldn't be here at all. Let's go, guys.",
        "Sandy: All set.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: No. No coffee. I don't think my system could handle the shock.",
        "Reva: Oh, come on, drink it. It'll make you feel good.",
        "Nate: The coffee or the shock?",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) At least lay off the alcohol for the rest of the night.",
        "Nate: I promise I won't touch another drop tonight. While you're watching. Reva, um, if I said anything or did anything out of line...",
        "Reva: If you did?",
        "Nate: Oh... what happened?",
        "Reva: Well, you seem to have forgotten that you put the cat in the margarita blender.",
        "Nate: Did I do that again? ( Laughter )",
        "Reva: Look, I know that you're worried about your loan and the Health Inspector, but I get the feeling that there's another reason why you've been drinking.",
        "Nate: Oh. ( Laughs ) Now, don't worry. There's considerably less going on in here than meets the eye.",
        "Reva: I don't buy that for a minute. ( Cell phone ringing ) Excuse me. Hello?",
        "Cassie: I hope you're not busy tonight. Edmund's throwing me a party at Towers and I'd really like for you to come. I really need you to come.",
        "Reva: Uh, yeah. I'll get over there. Okay, Sweetie, I'll see you later. That was my sister, Cassie. Her husband is throwing her a Here-We-Go-Again party, and I would imagine my whole family's going to be there.",
        "Nate: Meaning you want to be there as well. Oh, go on. I understand. Go. I'll be fine.",
        "Reva: Are you sure?",
        "Nate: I intend to hit the hay and not the bottle, if that's what you're worried about.",
        "Reva: I'm going to call you first thing in the morning. Thanks, Nate. ( Laughter )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: (Cell phone ringing) What?",
        "Nate: Aren't you on your way to the big family do? No. ( Laughs ) I didn't think you would be. Right, question. Talking about the Lewis's: Do you think Josh is the jealous type? I mean, is he the kind of guy that would cause a scene in public? Hey, actually, you know what? Don't worry about it. I'll find out myself.",
        "Jonathan: Great.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Jeffrey, what if I said when Alonzo told Cassie that he wanted will back in Ssan Christobal that Edmund called Alonzo and encouraged him to go after the boy and did not talk him out of it?",
        "Jeffrey: I'd say that's insane.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, well, his plan was to raise the stakes and terrify Cassie into thinking that Will was gone for good, and then he was going to dramatically turn everything around right at the end so he could play the hero.",
        "Jeffrey: And a forever- grateful Cassie would go running back into his arms.",
        "Dinah: You got it.",
        "Jeffrey: No, I got nothing. And neither do you.",
        "Dinah: Jeffrey, let me tell you something. I am the one person on this earth who understands who and what Edmund is about. She doesn't and I am going to prove that tonight at the Towers.",
        "Jeffrey: Stay away from there, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: When I show Cassie the real Edmund, she's going to realize that the lies, they haven't stopped, they never will, and that Edmund, he's not going to change no matter what she does. And then it's going to be over. So the only question is, here, when she falls to pieces, are you going to be there to pick up the pieces?",
        "Groupie: Excuse me, but Jeffrey, aren't you supposed to do another set?",
        "Jeffrey: Uh, yeah.",
        "Dinah: Oh, you're singing tonight?",
        "Groupie: He rules.",
        "Dinah: So, let me guess. You're going to sing some love songs filled with loss and regret.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, that's right. And I'm not going to crash that party, and if you do, and if you hurt Cassie, well, you know the drill.",
        "Dinah: Or what? You're going to make me pay? Yeah. You moved on. And you're telling me that I'm in a dream world? You know what, Jeffrey? You go on and sing your song about lost love, okay? But for me, tonight, I'm going to go after what I want, with or without you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: Yeah, we are absolutely delighted that you found the time to stop in Springfield after that wonderful win.",
        "Blake: What a pleasure to meet you. My boys and I, we watch \"The Amazing Race.\" We love it. We followed you. We were so for you. And you oh, we so felt for you when you had to shave your head. But it looks so wonderful.",
        "Joyce: Thank you.",
        "Blake: Oh, Josh.",
        "Josh: Yeah?",
        "Blake: Come here. I want you to meet Joyce and Uchenna. They are the winners of \"The Amazing Race.\"",
        "Ross: This is a friend of ours, Josh Lewis.",
        "Joyce: My pleasure to meet you.",
        "Josh: Nice to meet you, too. Congratulations. My niece and her boyfriend, big fans.",
        "Ross: We wish you could stay and join us for dinner.",
        "Uchenna: Unfortunately, we have another stop to make.",
        "Blake: But we'll see you tomorrow at City Hall.",
        "Joyce: Yes.",
        "Blake: Ross is giving them a key to the city.",
        "Josh: Ooh, great.",
        "Ross: So, congratulations again. Nice to see you.",
        "Joyce: Thank you.",
        "Ross: And we'll see you in the morning, all right?",
        "Joyce: Okay.",
        "Ross: Good night.",
        "Blake: See you then. Bye. Okay, remind me, bring a camera, all right?",
        "Ross: Bring a camera. Josh, it looks like you've lost somebody.",
        "Josh: My wife.",
        "Ross: Oh, she's a tough one to lose.",
        "Blake: Well, I talked to Cassie earlier and she said she was going to pry Reva from her job.",
        "Josh: Yeah, that may be a little tough, though. She loves that bartending thing.",
        "Ross: What does she find so appealing in doing that?",
        "Josh: I don't know, actually. I think maybe it has something to do with getting quality time away from me.",
        "Blake: Oh, stop it. That's not true.",
        "Josh: I think it's a little bit true, Blake.",
        "Blake: No, it's not. When Reva walks in, she's going to see your face. She's going to light up like she always does.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Hang on.",
        "Tammy: What's wrong?",
        "Sandy: Nothing. I just wanted you to myself for a minute. ( Clears throat )",
        "Tammy: Oh. Well, that can be arranged.",
        "Sandy: So, right after we toast Edmund and your mom, we leave.",
        "Tammy: Definitely.",
        "Sandy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Tammy: I want you to have me to yourself all night long.",
        "Sandy: Tammy, if you don't feel right, if you're not ready to spend the night, it's okay. We can wait.",
        "Tammy: No, it's not that.",
        "Sandy: Then what's wrong? Is it... you're not too psyched out about your mom and Edmund getting back together.",
        "Tammy: Uh, I have my doubts about it, for sure, but my mom's made her choice. I respect that.",
        "Sandy: Okay, then. Jonathan. What was he up to when Josh and I stopped by?",
        "Tammy: Um, he was... wait. Jonathan who?",
        "Sandy: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Joshua. Hi.",
        "Josh: Hey.",
        "Reva: Hi, guys.",
        "Josh: Hi, darling.",
        "Reva: Did I just totally miss everything? Am I too late?",
        "Josh: No. Hey, seeing you in that dress right now is well worth the wait. And I have to remember to thank Nate.",
        "Reva: For what?",
        "Josh: Well, for letting his best bartender have the night off. His loss, my gain. Hey, Sweetie.",
        "Nate: Can I have a beer?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Have you made all your calls?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. They're all going to be there.",
        "Edmund: Let us go, then.",
        "Cassie: You know what? I... I need a minute, if that's okay.",
        "Edmund: All right. All right. I love you.",
        "Jeffrey: ( Playing Guitar ) All the lessons that you learn and all the prayers that you offer in the night and all the strength that it takes to ease the pain and stop the fear Who would dare to try to tell you what is wrong and what is right out alone into the fields now you're asking is it real is it real you don't know but you've seen enough now you've seen enough now to last for years You are tired of the taste of salt and sadness in your tears you remember when the love and all the magic fell on you and in your mind's eye that's all you can see reflections of your memories memories all the lessons that you learn and all the prayers that you offer in the night and all the strength that it takes to ease the pain and stop the fear who would dare to try to tell you what is wrong and what is right Rright, right, right, right lonely, lonely, lonely time lonely, lonely, lonely time all the lessons that you learn and all the prayers that you offer and all those sweet, sweet, sweet memories. ( Cheers and applause ) Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Hey.",
        "Cassie: Hey.",
        "Sandy: Hey.",
        "Cassie: I'm so glad you came.",
        "Josh: It's nice to be here, thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Fun bunch, huh?",
        "Jonathan: Oh, yeah. That's right. ( Claps ) Whoop it up!",
        "Dinah: I had a feeling you'd be out here.",
        "Jonathan: Hm. Well, they wouldn't let me in there. What's your excuse?",
        "Dinah: Well, I'm just getting some fresh air before the real festivities begin. But you know what? I'm as much of an outsider as you. I always have been. Up until now.",
        "Jonathan: Are you saying that things are going to change? You're always saying that that's going to change.",
        "Dinah: Look at the happy couple. They're reunited. They have no idea how close they are to disaster-- disaster that you're going to help me hit them with.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: All right, I'll bite this time. Why should I help you, Dinah- mite?",
        "Dinah: Okay, I'll tell you why, Johnny boy. Because there's a party going on in there and your family's throwing it and it is for your family. But where are you? You're left out. Aren't you dying to get back at them?",
        "Jonathan: I don't care about their stupid party.",
        "Dinah: Oh, no. So, you're just hanging out here staring through the window for the fun of it. I think there's another reason.",
        "Jonathan: Let's hear it.",
        "Dinah: Those folks in there, they're smiling like idiots because they're celebrating a sham of a marriage. It is as phony as their pathetic lives. And I have known men that are too proud and too noble to shake things up, even if it is in their best interest. They don't want to make people know the truth. You're not like that.",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) Are you telling me that going after Cassie and Edmund is in my best interest?",
        "Dinah: You scratch my back and I'll scratch whatever you've got.",
        "Jonathan: Oh. Well. Now things are getting a little more interesting.",
        "Dinah: Well, you haven't heard the rest of it. Here's what's on my mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? Cassie and I wanted to gather our friends and our loved ones together in celebration of a reaffirmation of the commitment we made when we were married.",
        "Josh: Is it just me or does Cassie look like she's in the middle of a root canal?",
        "Reva: Ssh.",
        "Edmund: One thing has kept us together. One thing is going to keep us together for the rest of our lives, and that one thing is faith in one another. So, Cassie, tonight, before the people we care about the most, I want to say to you again what I first said to you when you won my heart. Your love is the most precious thing I have and I want to spend the rest of my life making sure you never regret the choice you've made. I love you. To our life together. To love.",
        "Reva: Love. ( Classes clink )",
        "Sandy: To love. ( Glasses clink )",
        "Ross: Don't even think it. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: ( Cell phone rings ) I'm off the clock.",
        "Nate: How about that dress your cousin Tammy's wearing?",
        "Jonathan: Where are you?",
        "Nate: I'm out of sight, like you. But I don't need to see your face to know what your expression is. Hurts, being left out, doesn't it?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah.",
        "Nate: You never get used to the sound of a door slamming in your face, or the laughter coming from a party you're not invited to. You do that thing I asked you?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. I took some money out of Lewis and put it in your account. I mean, enough... they won't notice it, but it's there.",
        "Nate: What about the other thing?",
        "Jonathan: Well, if I'm supposed to hurt somebody in the family, I want to do it to whoever is going to be hurt the worst, so it takes some time to figure that stuff out.",
        "Nate: Less than you think. Actually, cross it off your list, because I've got it covered.",
        "Jonathan: Hello? Hello?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: You know, for your information, Dad, I was invited to this party. She gave me this necklace.",
        "Ross: Well, isn't that nice?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. You know, why can't you be happy for me, because for the first time I am finally a part of an honest-to-goodness family.",
        "Ross: Dinah, this night should clearly tell you that once this baby is born, your role in this so-called family is over.",
        "Dinah: That is not true.",
        "Ross: They are not your friends and this necklace, at best it's a peace offering. It is not a guarantee that you're going to be a part of their lives. You have to come to your senses, honey. There's only one thing that you can do: Get a life of your own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Cassie, you have never looked lovelier and I've never been happier.",
        "Cassie: I'm happy, too.",
        "Dinah: Excuse me. Can I cut in?",
        "Cassie: Uh, sure.",
        "Edmund: All right.",
        "Dinah: No, actually, I'd like to dance with you.",
        "Edmund: That's not funny, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: It's not a joke. Cassie's a friend of mine. I don't think there's a problem dancing with her.",
        "Edmund: For God's sake, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: Oh, Edmund. Stop being so uptight.",
        "Cassie: I bet you're lighter on your feet than she is. I'll lead.",
        "Dinah: You know, this is a lovely party, and I love the necklace you gave me. It's very beautiful. And I appreciate you making me a part of everything.",
        "Cassie: You are a part of it.",
        "Dinah: I think this may usher in a whole new phase for this little m\u00e9nage a trois we have going on.",
        "Cassie: I don't know if I'd call it that, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: Sorry.",
        "Edmund: Do you mind if I cut in?",
        "Cassie: Not at all.",
        "Edmund: Thank you. You think you're so clever, don't you?",
        "Dinah: I got you to dance with me, didn't I?",
        "Tammy: My mom dancing with Dinah. That was weird.",
        "Sandy: I think it was pretty...",
        "Tammy: If you say \"hot,\" you're a dead man.",
        "Sandy: I wasn't going to say anything.",
        "Tammy: You just keep your focus on your partner.",
        "Sandy: Don't worry.",
        "Tammy: I really have been waiting for this night, Sandy.",
        "Sandy: And I've become the \u0091King of Cold Showers.'",
        "Tammy: Oh, I'm sorry. You've been so incredibly patient with me. I just hope that it's...",
        "Sandy: Oh, it will be. You'll see.",

        "Josh: Not only do I love that dress, I love the way you move in it.",
        "Reva: Oh, well, my partner helps that situation.",
        "Josh: ( Chuckles )",
        "Reva: Uh, you know what? I really am thirsty. I would love to have a drink, drink, drink, drink.",
        "Josh: You got it.",
        "Reva: Thanks. What are you doing here?",
        "Jonathan: I'm getting a drink.",
        "Reva: Jonathan, this is not the right place for you to be. There are people here who...",
        "Jonathan: What, full of people who hate me? Chill out. I'll get a drink and then I'll leave, and I'll never disgrace the blessed doors of this family again.",
        "Reva: Stop it. Stop it. You know that's not what I want. It's just that I worry about you. That... ( exasperated sigh )",

        "Cassie: This feels so good, so right. I don't know why I fought this for so long.",

        "Groupie: You know what I like about you, Jeffrey?",
        "Jeffrey: What?",
        "Groupie: You don't want some deep, heavy relationship. You're not into the hearts and flowers kind of junk, all those complications. You just want to have a good time. That makes things so much more fun. So come on, take me home. It's fun time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: Don't they look cozy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: I wonder what your wife would say if she knew that you used Will and you royally screwed it up, pardon the expression.",
        "Edmund: Listen to me, Dinah, and listen to me well. If I ever find out that you've even hinted to Cassie about what happened to Will, the child may live happily ever after, but the same will not be said for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: What are you doing?",

        "Reva: ( Laughs )",
        "Nate: I was about to come in and surprise you and I decided I needed a little air. ( Laughs )",
        "Reva: What you need is a couple of aspirin and a good night's sleep.",

        "Josh: I don't suppose you've seen your mom anywhere, have you?",
        "Jonathan: Nope, can't say that I have.",
        "Josh: Well, maybe she's had one of her hot flashes and went out to the balcony. Excuse me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Easy.",
        "Nate: Yes. Easy, it is.",

        "Josh: All right, I'm on my way.",
        "Reva: Is there trouble?",
        "Josh: Yeah. A snafu at one of the construction sites. I really hate to leave, but...",
        "Reva: I understand. When duty calls, you have to answer. I get that. I'll find my own way home.",
        "Josh: Actually, I was kind of hoping you would say that you couldn't possibly live without me.",
        "Reva: You already know that.",
        "Josh: Okay, this is for you.",

        "Edmund: I just want to make sure I'm getting through to you.",
        "Dinah: And I want to make sure that I'm getting through to you. If you hurt my baby, I may have to leave and protect my baby.",
        "Edmund: Don't use this baby to coerce me, Dinah. We have a deal and it's in writing.",
        "Dinah: I have a baby inside of me and believe it or not, I am more dangerous than you are right now.",
        "Cassie: Hey. Everything all right?",
        "Edmund: Yes, well, I don't think Dinah and I are suited as dance partners. She keeps stepping on my toes.",

        "Jonathan: Why do you have to mess with Reva?",
        "Nate: Would you rather I mess with you? I quite like her, actually. The security codes, do you have them?",
        "Jonathan: What are you going to do with them?",
        "Nate: I'll tell you when everything's ready. In the meantime, there's more than one way to penetrate Lewis. ( Laughs )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: This time, no one cuts in.",
        "Cassie: I want to dance with you, I do. I just really need to go freshen up.",
        "Edmund: Okay.",

        "Sandy: Right now?",
        "Josh: Yes. I'm afraid so. Tammy, we could use your help, too, if that makes you feel any better.",
        "Tammy: We were just about to leave anyway.",
        "Josh: Okay. Let's go.",
        "Sandy: Might as well cut your losses. You can't ruin this event.",

        "Dinah: Well, I am. I'm going to tell Cassie and I'm going to tell everybody how you manipulated this situation just to look like you were worthy of love in front of Cassie's eyes.",
        "Edmund: Dinah, I want you to shut your mouth.",
        "Dinah: I'm not going to shut my mouth because I'm not going to bring this baby into a family that is living a lie. The truth is going to come out and it's going to come out right now. _Next, on \"Guiding Light,\" _",
        "Dinah: Where's our hostess?",
        "Cassie: We shouldn't do this now.",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, yes. Yes.",

        "Edmund: Dinah is perfectly safe. I can guarantee that.",
        "Dinah: And I know they're going to find me. I know it.",
        "Bill: For once, this isn't one of Dinah's games.",
