        "Tammy: What do you think? For the wedding.",
        "Jonathan: What wedding?",
        "Tammy: The wedding. Lizzie and Coop? I can't believe it's today. It just... happened so fast. But okay, what do you like? Be honest.",
        "Jonathan: You really want to go to this thing?",
        "Tammy: Okay, so Lizzie and Coop aren't the perfect couple, but... it's a wedding. And there's a baby. Happy, happy!",
        "Jonathan: Happy, happy.",
        "Tammy: Oh, Coop asked me to come and meet him. But I'll be back soon to get ready, okay? And Reva called. She wants you to call her back. Be back soon. ( Door opens and closes )",
        "Jonathan: ( Sighs ) I don't have to call her back. I already know what she's going to say...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Okay, Jonathan. ( Coughs ) Cough. Get a cold, comes out of nowhere. ( Coughs ) \"Spaulding heiress weds today.\" \"Spaulding wedding,\" \"Spaulding merger\"... everything's Spaulding. Maybe I'm allergic to the Spaul... ( coughs ) Jonathan. You have got to stand up. You've got to stand up today and say something about that baby of yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Okay. It didn't mean anything. It didn't... mean... anything. Hello, Reva darling. I'm sorry, were you...",
        "Reva: No, no.",
        "Josh: ...Calling somebody, or...?",
        "Reva: No, it wasn't important.",
        "Josh: Well, this is important. I have to go meet with the architect to talk about some changes I want for the... for the rehab project.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) So you're flying to Tulsa, then?",
        "Josh: ( Laughs ) No, not to Tulsa. I am flying to... wait, let me check, let me see. Uh, yeah, San Francisco. And I was thinking that maybe you would like to come along with me.",
        "Reva: San Francisco?",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Reva: Today?",
        "Josh: Yeah. I just, I know we've had a little problem connecting lately. You know, the thing that happened with the interview, and then postponing the trip to Chicago.",
        "Reva: I'm sorry.",
        "Josh: No, no, no, that's fine. I told you before, you don't have to put your life on hold because of my project. But this is sort of a... a special request. And I promise you, we'll have a really good time. So don't... don't turn me down, okay? I really, really... really want this to be something that we do together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: No! No, no, no! Not there, up here. I already said that.",
        "Beth: And those. Those there have to go half a foot to the left or they are going to be in the way of the photographs. Do you...",
        "Lizzie: There's not much time! He's not paying attention.",
        "Beth: We'd better check with the chef.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, gosh. Could you do that? I... I've got something I have to do.",
        "Beth: What? Lizzie...",
        "Lizzie: I will meet you in the suite. You're going to help me get ready, right?",
        "Beth: Yes, of course... I wouldn't miss it. Don't... don't you be late, hm?",
        "Lizzie: To my own wedding? Please. Everything's going to be perfect. Thank you, Mom. Oh, God. This is it. I'm going to get to marry Coop. ( Laughs ) I never knew I could ever be this happy, Mom. Ever.",

        "Alan: Beth.",
        "Beth: Alan. You're early.",
        "Alan: Well, if you ask me, I'd say I was too late.",
        "Beth: Oh, Alan, could you at least pretend to be happy, for Lizzie's sake?",
        "Alan: If the man that Elizabeth chose was worthy of her, I might be excited about it.",
        "Beth: Coop is a very nice young man.",
        "Alan: But he doesn't love her. And judging by what I saw last night, he never will.",

        "Buzz: What are you looking for?",
        "Coop: Oh, what, uh... nothing. Nothing, everything's fine.",
        "Buzz: Oh good, then we can talk about me.",
        "Coop: Okay.",
        "Buzz: This father of the groom thing, you know, I didn't even understand the job description. Father of the bride is sort of straightforward, but the father of the groom is... you know, I don't know what the responsibilities of that particular situation are.",
        "Coop: Okay, you were at Frank's wedding, right?",
        "Buzz: I... I... how shall I put this? I was, uh... on the outside looking in, so this would be my first attempt at the role.",
        "Coop: Well, this is my first attempt at being a groom, so... if you have any words of wisdom about marriage and married life, I would be happy to hear it.",
        "Buzz: Don't forget who you are. Hang onto that, and you'll be just fine.",
        "Coop: Don't worry about that.",
        "Buzz: I wasn't worried about it.",
        "Coop: Okay.",
        "Buzz: You asked.",
        "Coop: ( Laughs ) Come here. Thanks so much, Pop.",
        "Ava: ( Shrieks ) Oh my gosh, where's the fire?",
        "Buzz: Uh, well, not in the kitchen, I hope. I've got some pastries...",
        "Ava: No, I took them out. Of the oven. They're fine.",
        "Buzz: Oh, thank you. Thank you. Yeah, I have to pack them up and take them over to Towers for...",
        "Ava: For the wedding. It's okay, you can say... Lizzie and Coop's wedding. I'm proud of Coop being a stand up guy, Buzz.",

        "Coop: Tammy, hi. Thank you for coming down, uh...",
        "Tammy: Listen... I'm sorry about the mess with Jonathan at the shower the other day. He honestly thought that Lizzie was drinking...",
        "Coop: Actually, you know, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. I needed to ask you a favor.",
        "Tammy: Okay?",
        "Coop: Tammy, I need you to keep Jonathan away from the wedding today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "( Knock a the door )",
        "Jonathan: Shouldn't you be getting all fluffed up somewhere?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, that's actually exactly where I should be, but I thought that I would stop by and make sure that there aren't going to be any surprises today.",
        "Jonathan: Surprises?",
        "Lizzie: In a couple of hours, it's going to be me, Coop, and the baby. For better or worse, til death do us part, okay? We are going to be a family unless you do something to screw that up. So this is it, Jonathan. Promise me that you are going to walk away from this baby for good.",
        "Lizzie: You swore to me that you didn't want to have anything to do with this child.",
        "Jonathan: I don't.",
        "Lizzie: That's why you were right there to catch me when I fell off the ladder? Yesterday at my shower, Jonathan, you turned into nervous Nelly because you thought I was boozing?!",
        "Jonathan: That doesn't mean anything.",
        "Lizzie: I have to... you kept this?",
        "Jonathan: Reva left it here.",
        "Lizzie: What the hell are you doing? Were you trying to blow this for everyone?",
        "Jonathan: No, I told you, I'm walking away.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, you'd better be! Coop is going to be a great dad, okay, Jonathan! And you, you're...",
        "Jonathan: What? Me, what?!",
        "Lizzie: Nothing! Come on, that picture says something else. It is my wedding day, Jonathan, give me the picture!",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie, get off!",
        "Lizzie: Look, it is everything. And that means you have to throw this picture away! You have to burn it! Coop is the father of my baby. You know that that's how it has to be! Give that picture to me! You have just as much to lose as I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: So you're uninviting us to the wedding.",
        "Coop: No, not you. Just Jonathan. All right? Lizzie definitely wants to see you there.",
        "Tammy: Well, you take away his invitation, you take away mine. I'm sorry.",
        "Coop: Well. Me, too. Every time Jonathan gets anywhere near me or Lizzie, he just starts to... look, Jonathan doesn't like me, I don't like him. Neither does Lizzie, all right? And she has worked very hard to make sure that everything comes out right.",
        "Tammy: What do you think Jonathan is going to do?",
        "Coop: I don't know. Tammy, I really don't know. But I don't want to take the chance.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, well, no one does.",
        "Coop: Tammy, come on...",
        "Tammy: It's fine. Don't worry about it.",
        "Coop: Just... come alone. It would mean a lot to Lizzie.",
        "Tammy: Doesn't work that way. Have a nice wedding. Congratulate Lizzie for me.",

        "Coop: Hey.",
        "Ava: So today's your big day. Good for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: So, there he was, the man who is going to marry our Elizabeth, in the arms of another woman. A woman who looked like they could pop out of the cake at any bachelor party.",
        "Beth: That would be Ava.",
        "Alan: Yes, Ava. The waitress. It was obvious they were very connected. And would have liked to have been more connected.",
        "Beth: And just how long were you standing there, Alan? And... and did anything actually happen?",
        "Alan: Well, no, nothing actually happened, but judging from his behavior, he does not love Elizabeth.",
        "Beth: Oh, Alan, so what? He loved her once. He will again. That baby will bring them together. No, don't put those there!",
        "Alan: The baby does not need Henry, nor does Elizabeth.",
        "Beth: Alan, it's what Lizzie wants. And Coop will be a very good father to that baby.",
        "Alan: We can take care of the baby.",
        "Beth: What?",
        "Alan: Yes. Why must there always be a Cooper involved in our future? No good ever comes of it!",
        "Beth: Alan, don't get worked up. It is what it is. Lizzie wants to marry Coop.",
        "Alan: That's not my priority.",
        "Beth: Really? Then what is?",
        "Alan: The child, Beth. The child.",

        "Reva: You have to believe that I want to be a part of everything you're working on.",
        "Josh: I do believe that, yes.",
        "Reva: Then you also have to believe that there's not a problem, it's just that we... we've both been so busy lately.",
        "Josh: That's true, we... Reva, um... listen, uh, I know that you're happy here. And I can see that you're happy when we're together.",
        "Reva: I am.",
        "Josh: Well, lately, I've just been feeling like there's this little bit of distance between us.",
        "Reva: No. No, not like that.",
        "Josh: I'm just saying that, uh, if there's something wrong, I don't know if there is, but if there is... then let's fix it before it gets really bad.",
        "Reva: No...",
        "Josh: You know, just tell me what it is, and we'll fix it.",
        "Reva: No, no, sweetie. There's nothing to fix. Everything's fine. I mean you know... you know how proud I am of you and the work that you're doing. And I've never seen you this happy.",
        "Josh: Well, I don't know that I ever have been. But I'd be a whole lot happier if I knew that my wife was, you know, with me in this.",
        "Reva: I am, I am here for you. 100%. I would never do anything to get in the way of what you're doing.",
        "Josh: So we're okay?",
        "Reva: Absolutely.",

        "Josh: A cold? That's your excuse?",
        "Reva: No, it's not, it's not an excuse, sweetie. You know how it is, you know? You... ( coughs ) You get on the plane, even if it's the Lewis jet, you get on with a cold and you walk off with full-blown pneumonia. And I just can't afford to get sick right now. Not now, because you need me for the project. You know? You need my help, you need me there 100%. To help you.",
        "Josh: Reva, what you're saying, it doesn't even really make any sense. Okay? You don't want to go with me now and help me now because you're afraid you're going to get sick... and not be able to help me later?",
        "Reva: You know what I meant.",
        "Josh: No, actually, Reva, I don't. All I know is that you're doing your best to try to avoid me.",
        "Reva: No.",
        "Josh: Then help me to understand, Reva. How can I not get on that plane and fly all the way to the west coast and not be thinking about the empty seat that's sitting next to me?",
        "Reva: Whatever you're thinking, it's not what you think.",
        "Josh: Then what is it?",
        "Reva: I just can't go, okay? I just can't pick up and go!",
        "Josh: Why can't you go, Reva!",
        "Reva: Because, there's-- there's a wedding, okay?",
        "Josh: A wedding?",
        "Reva: Yes.",
        "Josh: You're talking about Lizzie Spaulding's wedding? Who cares about that. We're not even invited!",
        "Reva: I care! I care.",
        "Josh: Why, do you care!",
        "Reva: Because, I just-- I care. Okay?",

        "Beth: You are not going to call off this wedding. And yes, I am aware how important the baby is. But Lizzie wants Coop and that baby. Her happiness and security is every bit as important to me. And I am aware that Coop has feelings for another... girl. But he will get over that. He knows what his obligations are. He will put Lizzie first.",
        "Alan: Where did you get this high opinion of Henry Cooper?",
        "Beth: He is a good young man, and so is his father.",
        "Alan: His father?",
        "Beth: Mmm.",
        "Buzz: Oh, thank you for that. Just for that, I'll set you aside... let you sample one of my pastries.",
        "Beth: Well, thank you very much, but I think I'll do it after the wedding. But just so I know, do you have any...",

        "Alan: Really, and what woman are you baking for these days, Buzz?",
        "Buzz: Oh, that's cold.",
        "Beth: Play nice, you boys.",
        "Buzz: Don't worry, the role of the supportive father of the groom will be played by me.",
        "Alan: You should be supportive. He's very lucky to have Elizabeth.",
        "Buzz: Elizabeth is lucky to have him. I'll drop the pastries off. Save a dance for me.",
        "Beth: ( Laughs ) You know, I think that Lizzie is marrying into a very nice family. And you know what I think, too? I think they're going to be very happy together.",
        "Alan: Once again, I must resolve myself to spend holidays with the Coopers. While you, on the other hand, are looking forward to dancing with Buzz tonight, and sharing the special pastry he's making for you.",
        "Beth: Well, at least he knows I have a favorite pastry.",
        "Alan: Yes, and you've also become the president of Henry Cooper's fan club.",
        "Beth: Well, Alan, what can I say to you? Coop and I, understand each other. And, he understands what he has to do.",
        "Alan: Tell me something, why would you want Elizabeth to marry a man who may never love her back?",
        "Beth: Because Coop is the father of that baby. And believe me, he is much better than the alternative.",
        "Alan: Alternative? Wh...what do you mean, alternative?",
        "Beth: This wedding is going to happen. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go and help my daughter get dressed. And you know, Alan, if I were you, I would sit back, relax, and start to accept that Henry Cooper is going to be joining this family. Because that will happen, and nothing is going stop it!",

        "Lizzie: ( Claps ) Two thumbs up. Three handkerchiefs, I cried until I cried.",
        "Ava: I'm surprised you're here.",
        "Lizzie: I bet you are.",
        "Ava: I hear Towers looks beautiful. It's going to be very elegant.",
        "Lizzie: Yes, it will be.",
        "Ava: I want you to take care of Coop. Take good care of him. And I am really happy for you. You and for Coop.",
        "Lizzie: Please. I was here for the big goodbye, Ava. You can drop the whole Mother Teresa thing, we both know what you really wish. But there are some wishes that just don't come true, though. This would be one of them. It's over, Ava. Once and for all. Sweetie, I won. And you lost. That's all she wrote.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Welcome to the family, Henry.",
        "Coop: Thank you, Alan.",
        "Alan: Perhaps I should save my warm welcome until after the wedding. That is, assuming there will be a wedding.",
        "Coop: There will be a wedding, Alan. Lizzie and I are starting our life together.",
        "Alan: Yes, I, got an eyeful of your old life last night. You in the arms of a woman who isn't the bride today. My wife tells me not to worry about that, that you will honor your commitment and that you are the best man possible for Elizabeth.",
        "Coop: Beth told you that?",
        "Alan: Yes, she did. But I'd like to hear it directly from you.",
        "Buzz: Everybody okay?",
        "Coop: I can take care of this, Pop.",
        "Buzz: You're the man. See you in a bit.",
        "Coop: Yeah.",
        "Alan: As I was saying, I would like to hear it directly from you.",
        "Coop: I'm starting a family, Alan. That's why, I'm here. Now, if there's one thing that you and I both agree upon, it's about family. The word, family. I'll be raising a daughter. And in a few short hours, I will be taking a wife. I'll be taking care, of the wife. I take both of those very seriously. Very seriously, Alan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: \"I won and you lost\"? You don't love him. You wanted to win him.",
        "Lizzie: I had him. And long before you wormed your way into our town, Coop loved me like you will never be loved in your wildest dreams. We're just trying to fix something that should have never been broken.",
        "Ava: Mm. Just do your best to keep him happy.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, we will be. Because the truth is, Coop and I belong together.",
        "Ava: No, the truth is, if you weren't pregnant and using it to get at him, there would be no wedding. There is one reason why Coop's marrying you and that is because he's a good guy. And if you love him even a fraction of the amount you say you do, you wouldn't let him go through with this. But Coop feels responsible, so he's willing to sacrifice his life, and keep his standards so high, and feel good about himself, that he's going to go through with this. And that's just because he's a great guy.",
        "Lizzie: Wow. You poor thing. You really are desperate. But, by all means, I mean, do what you have to do, make up what you have to make up to get through this, because I know how Coop feels about me. Were you there when he asked me to marry him, Ava? No one was holding a gun to his head. He said how he feels to me. So if you loved him as much as you say that you do, you would disappear. Let him move on and be happy. But I get it. You're lost and alone, and you know that by tomorrow, the man probably won't even remember your name.",
        "Ava: Poor Coop. He's going to be stuck with a selfish bitch like you. Maybe he needs a last-minute wake-up call.",
        "Lizzie: Go ahead, Ava. Do what you have to do.",
        "Ava: Oh, don't worry. I'll do what I have to do. Mrs. Spaulding...",
        "Beth: Hello, Ava.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Ready when you are. So, what do we have to take care of before we go?",
        "Jonathan: Uh, one quick phone call, and then we can go.",
        "Reva: ( Coughs ) ( cell phone rings ) Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. I got your messages, all 20 of them.",
        "Reva: Well, good, um, I need to see you. I just want to talk to you for a few minutes. Just tell me where you are, and I'll... ( coughs ) I'll come to you.",
        "Jonathan: Sorry. Not today. Don't have time to fit an argument in. I'm just calling to say goodbye.",
        "Reva: Goodbye?",
        "Jonathan: We're leaving town. Tammy and me.",
        "Reva: But the... ( coughs ) The wedding.",
        "Jonathan: We're skipping it. Sorry. I can't talk anymore right now. But I'll call you back later, okay? I love you. Bye, Mom.",
        "Reva: ( Coughs )",
        "Jonathan: Nothing standing in our way.",
        "Tammy: You sure?",
        "Jonathan: I'm more sure than I've ever been. Let's get the heck out of dodge.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Nana. You're here.",
        "Lillian: Oh, of course I am, sweetie. Hi.",
        "Lizzie: ( Gasps ) Is that...?",
        "Lillian: All ready for Springfield's most beautiful bride.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, gosh! It's a dream, Nana. Part of me still can't believe that it's happening. It's finally happening. I am getting married. I'm getting married. ( Laughs )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: What's going on here, what's this all about?",
        "Beth: This? This is me making sure my daughter has a wonderful day with no unexpected surprises. This is me taking no chances. Me, saying... it's time to go.",
        "Chauffeur: Yes, ma'am.",
        "Ava: Where are we going?",
        "Beth: Bye, bye.",
        "Ava: ( Shrieks ) What are you doing to me?",
        "Chauffeur: Come on.",
        "Ava: No!",
        "Beth: Look at that. I broke a nail. Yes?",
        "Chauffeur: Meat locker. Don't worry, I threw a coat in there with her.",
        "Beth: Well that was very nice of you. I have a wedding to go to. Shall we?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Is there anything else, Alan? I still do have to get ready.",
        "Alan: Yes, there's something that we should talk about before everything gets started.",
        "Coop: We haven't said everything that we wanted to say?",
        "Alan: I want to know what you're going to do after the wedding. What kind of work you're going to do, how you're going to provide for Elizabeth and her baby.",
        "Coop: Uh-uh. Our baby.",
        "Alan: I may be able to help you.",
        "Coop: No, Alan. Thank you very much, but no.",
        "Alan: Now's the time to put your foolish pride aside, because the more important thing here is that baby. And providing for Elizabeth and the child. Now, what's more important than that?",
        "Coop: Not a thing. There is not a thing in this world that is more important.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Oh, wait till you see it on. The first time I put it on and looked in the mirror, I couldn't even believe it was me.",
        "Lillian: Oh, sweetie.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, wait, the veil's in here too, right?",
        "Lillian: Wait a second. There's something I want to say.",
        "Lizzie: Now?",
        "Lillian: Yeah, right now. I think you know how I feel, I mean, you know how much I love you, and you know how much I want what's best for you.",
        "Lizzie: Of course. That is why I know that you want this for me. Coop is the best thing for me. The best thing for me and my baby.",
        "Lillian: You're absolutely sure?",
        "Lizzie: Absolutely.",
        "Lillian: Because, you know, you don't have to get married.",
        "Lizzie: I want to. I want to marry Coop.",
        "Lillian: Then I'm very, very happy for you. ( Knock on door ) Ooh, you'd better hide, in case someone will see the perfect bride. Oh, sweetie, I'm so glad you're here.",
        "Beth: Mom... yeah, I had something to take care of. Is Lizzie...",
        "Lillian: Yes, she's about to get dressed.",
        "Beth: Lizzie? Oh, sweetie.",
        "Lizzie: Did you... do that...?",
        "Beth: Yes. Yes, everything is, taken care of. We're all set.",
        "Lizzie: Then I guess the only thing left is to start getting dressed. Getting on with my life, with Coop. ( Laughs )",
        "Beth: Yes.",
        "Lizzie: This is my day. It's finally happening. It's really, really happening!",
        "Beth: Yes, sweetie, it is your day. And nothing and no one can take that away from you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colin: Don't, don't move. Stay right where you are. You're not going anywhere.",
        "Reva: Why are you making this such an emergency?",
        "Colin: Be quiet, Reva.",
        "Reva: So give me a vitamin shot, and...",
        "Colin: Open up.",
        "Reva: ...I swear that I will go right home and go to bed.",
        "Colin: No, you won't. You're already in bed and you're staying right where you are.",
        "Reva: Why? It's a cold! ( Coughs )",
        "Colin: No, it's not. According to your blood work, Reva, you have the flu.",
        "Reva: Okay, so I have the flu, so give me something and send me home.",
        "Colin: No! What, what is the matter with you? Did, did you not take a look at the stuff I gave you, the pamphlets?",
        "Reva: Yes, I read the stuff.",
        "Colin: Okay, well, lousy memory. Lie back, listen and do what you're told. For patients on chemo, the flu can be very serious, Reva. Very serious.",
        "Reva: What does that mean?",
        "Colin: Lie back. Nurse, let's get an I.V. on her stat, please? Of fluids, antibiotics. Let's move, huh? The works. We've got no time to waste.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Oh, I can't believe we're going away together.",
        "Jonathan: The town outcasts.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, well. Getting uninvited to Lizzie and Coop's wedding is the best thing that ever happened to us.",
        "Jonathan: Forget about them. Time to forget about everything but us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Colin. ( Coughs ) Listen to me.",
        "Colin: No, Reva, Reva. You listen to me. Close your eyes and rest, okay? You're not going anywhere.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Alexandra: Where's the groom?",
        "Buzz: Good question. He disappeared while I was dressing. Haven't seen him since.",
        "Alan: Another Spaulding- Cooper union. God help us, Buzz.",
        "Beth: Kindly escort Mr. Randall out. ( Gasp ) ( crash )",
        "Coop: Things could get worse for you very quickly."
