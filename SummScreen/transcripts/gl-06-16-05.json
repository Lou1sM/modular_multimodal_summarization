        "Edmund: Okay.",
        "Cassie: Hi.",
        "Jeffrey: Hi. Okay, I know what you're thinking, and I shouldn't be here. You're right, I shouldn't be here, but there's something I really need to tell you and if you look into my eyes, Cassie, you'll know exactly what that is.",
        "Cassie: Oh, Jeffrey, please. Not now.",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, right now. I don't give a damn. Okay? I've waited long enough and I'm not going to wait any longer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Dinah, what are you doing?",
        "Dinah: I am going to let Cassie and everybody know how you have used this situation with Will.",
        "Edmund: No, Dinah. You're going to shut your mouth.",
        "Dinah: I am not going to shut my mouth. And I am not going to bring a child into a family that is living a lie. That is not fair to the child. I'm not going to do this. And the truth, it's going to come out right now, right here.",
        "Edmund: Dinah. Dinah, I'm not going to let...",
        "Jonathan: Uncle Eddie.",
        "Edmund: Get out of my way.",
        "Jonathan: Man, when you have a party, you really know what you're doing. Nothing but the best.",
        "Dinah: Testing, one-two- three. Testing. Is this on?",
        "Edmund: Dinah...",
        "Dinah: Could you please turn the microphone up, please? Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: All right, Brian, this all looks good. Thank you very much. Somebody from the department will be in touch.",
        "Buzz: Looks like you could use a break.",
        "Frank: Hey, Pop. You bet I could. Thank you. Hey, listen, have you seen or heard from Marina lately?",
        "Buzz: Frank... sit down. You know how wound up you get whenever Harley takes off without thinking, you know?",
        "Frank: Yeah, and gets herself into big trouble.",
        "Buzz: Yeah.",
        "Frank: Like she is, like, now with Gus and all that with bounty hunters and marshals on her tail?",
        "Buzz: Right. Exactly. Drink up, Frank. Have a drink.",
        "Frank: Hey, Pop, out with it. Why are we talking about Harley when I just asked you about Marina?",
        "Buzz: Well, your daughter and your sister are a lot alike. They're like, you know, two peas in a pod, Frank. Just two peas in a pod.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: What? At least it went over there.",
        "Danny: I guess you don't need my help.",
        "Marina: No. But you did learn something about me today, didn't you?",
        "Danny: I did?",
        "Marina: Yeah, I'm real good at this.",
        "Danny: That you're a pool player?",
        "Marina: I'm going to take the money anyway just for that comment. Thank you very much.",
        "Danny: Maybe we should take all that money and go on another trip as Gus and Harley-- or better yet, as Danny and Marina.",
        "Marina: Oh, yeah.",
        "Danny: Rio. Tahiti.",
        "Marina: What's the matter?",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Marina: Are you afraid I'm going to show you up if we play another game?",
        "Danny: Yeah. Yeah, terrified. There is one thing I'm afraid of though.",
        "Marina: What's that?",
        "Danny: Well, if you and I were to spend another night in a hotel room together, I might not be such a gentleman about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Guess who?",
        "Bill: ( Laughs ) What do I get if I guess right?",
        "Olivia: Well...",
        "Bill: My goodness. I know that grip anywhere. Is it old Suzy Q?",
        "Olivia: Hey.",
        "Bill: Oh, wait a minute. It's you.",
        "Olivia: Oh, me.",
        "Bill: You have an appointment?",
        "Olivia: I do not need an appointment. I came to take you away from all of this.",
        "Bill: Oh, you came to take me away? That's funny, because I thought I was the one taking you away.",
        "Olivia: From a weird... admittedly weird, but challenging job at Spaulding that offers me a lot...",
        "Bill: Whatever it offers, it can't offer you what I can, and that is a loving beautiful family.",
        "Olivia: I've never known that feeling before. I mean, now with you, yes, but never before.",
        "Bill: Well, what about with your sister? Marissa? I mean, you must have had... all right, well, you know what? It's never too late to start building. In fact, have you heard from your sister lately?",
        "Olivia: No. Not in a long time. And Sam hasn't either. And I'm worried about her, because... I don't know. I'm just hoping she pops up, that she's just hiding from that miserable husband of hers.",
        "Bill: Turned out to be a bad guy, huh?",
        "Olivia: The worst.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: Didly-diley. Got you.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) What am I doing? My family is in there celebrating, and where am I?",
        "Nate: You're out here with me. And you hardly seems anxious to leave, Reva. Why is that? Hmm?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You're right, Jeffrey. You shouldn't be here. This is my night. It's my night with Edmund. And we shouldn't do this now.",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, yes. Yes. We should do this now. We're going to do this now, okay? Yeah, this is your celebration tonight. You're celebrating a new life. And tonight is the first night of the rest your life.",
        "Cassie: My life with Edmund.",
        "Jeffrey: No, Cassie, your life. Okay? You understand? Your life. So how are you going to spend it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: What are you doing here?",
        "Jonathan: You really know how to roll out the red carpet. Nothing but the best.",
        "Edmund: You're disgusting. Dinah. Stop.",
        "Dinah: Can I have your attention everybody, please?",
        "Jonathan: Oh, speech! Whoo-hoo!",
        "Dinah: Thank you. There's something that I wanted to say tonight, and there's really no time like the present and to share it with all of you, right here, right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: We have to go to Cassie's party.",
        "Bill: Party? We can have our own little party right here. We can.",
        "Olivia: No. No. Look, anticipation has its rewards, partner.",
        "Bill: Mm-hmm.",
        "Olivia: All right. Besides, we have priorities.",
        "Bill: You talking about Emma?",
        "Olivia: Yes. Which we're going to war with Alan. So we need a lot of support. So we need to go to this party and show this town what a loving, supportive couple we could be.",
        "Bill: By showing up to Cassie's big night. That's okay. That's great.",
        "Olivia: Look, I promise you when this is over...",
        "Bill: Yes.",
        "Olivia: ...I will take you home and I will slather lots of delicious dessert topping all over your body.",
        "Bill: I like the sound of that.",
        "Olivia: Uh-huh.",
        "Bill: I like the sound of that. But just keep calling me \"Partner.\"",
        "Olivia: Yeah, it's just an expression. Don't read too much into it.",
        "Bill: So you're telling me you're not going to be quitting Spaulding any time soon?",
        "Olivia: I'll let you know. Don't worry.",
        "Bill: You'll let me know?",
        "Olivia: Yeah.",
        "Bill: Okay, I'm all set. I'm not worried. Because tonight I'm focused on three things: Making you believe I am the best partner you could have in business, parenting, and in bed. And not necessarily in that order.",
        "Olivia: Oh. We have a party to get to. I'm not letting you do this.",
        "Bill: Listen. No drafting table?",
        "Olivia: No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: The reason I'm not leaving right now is because I'm afraid.",
        "Nate: Afraid.",
        "Reva: Afraid for you, you dope. You're half drunk 20 stories up.",
        "Nate: You're afraid, but not for me. Not just for me.",
        "Reva: Look, Nate...",
        "Nate: I am. And what I see is a woman who claims to be fearless, but when she's in my company...",
        "Reva: I'm not scared. I'm not. What I am is married.",
        "Nate: So I've heard, repeatedly.",
        "Reva: Jonathan.",
        "Nate: Reva, wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Jonathan, you're either going to leave under your own steam or I'm going to throw you out...",
        "Reva: Jonathan?",
        "Jonathan: Mama Bear.",
        "Reva: Hi. Why are you still here? Get the hell out. How much plainer do I have to be now? Get out of here now. You don't belong here tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: All right, here we go. Actually, I can't go on with my speech without the other guest of honor here. Cassie, where are you? Cassie?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Say what you have to say.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. I was set, you know... I was thinking a lot about this and, yeah, you have a choice to make. And it's your choice. But, you know, there's other people that have a choice, too. And I have a choice. I realize that I have a choice. And, Cassie, I choose you. And I know you don't want to hear that right now.",
        "Cassie: You're wrong. I do want to hear it.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Well, then here it is. Nothing... nothing held back. I feel like you've changed so much for me and you've brought so much into my life.",
        "Cassie: Oh, yeah. Like frustration and misery.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, that too. But you've done something that no other woman has done for me in so long. You made me feel again.",
        "Cassie: Do you know that every night when I lay down and I close my eyes...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Come on, where's our hostess? Cassie? Cassie?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: I think you'd better go.",
        "Cassie: No, Jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, yeah, you'd better go. Go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Edmund.",
        "Dinah: There she is.",
        "Edmund: Hi.",
        "Dinah: Cassie...",
        "Cassie: Is everything okay?",
        "Dinah: There's something I think needs to be said, you know. Something that needs to be known with all of us here.",
        "Edmund: You know, how Dinah is. I mean she just wants to talk tonight.",
        "Cassie: This is Dinah. She just wants to say something. Just let her. There's nothing that she could do that's going to hurt us.",
        "Edmund: Oh. Oh, I'm so terribly sorry. I'm going to go get some napkins.",
        "Cassie: That truth would be something that is very important for... for... hello? Can we turn the microphone on, please? Excuse me. Can you turn the microphone on, please?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: Well-done, kid.",
        "Jonathan: What are you still doing here?",
        "Nate: You know how I like a good party.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah? You like getting caught, too? This place is crawling with Lewis's. And you remember that Aunt Olivia is married to one of them, right? So I suggest you sneak out of here while you still have time.",
        "Nate: What's your hurry?",
        "Jonathan ( Imitating Nate ): I've got something else to do, Dad. ( Laughter )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: She went to Chicago with Danny?",
        "Buzz: Yeah, to pretend to be Gus and Harley. To throw anybody off whose looking for them.",
        "Frank: Dad, doesn't she know how stupid this is?",
        "Buzz: Frank.",
        "Frank: How dangerous this is? Are you kidding me?",
        "Buzz: She's her own woman. She made a choice. Frank, for what it's worth, Danny said she's something to see on her feet. Frank.",
        "Frank: It's me, Pop, right? It's got to be me, right? Because I've raised both of these girls. And you know what? They're getting into trouble time and time again.",
        "Buzz: They're going to keep doing it probably for the rest of their lives. So you'd better get used to it.",
        "Frank: Why couldn't I just have raised, like, two safe, reliable housewives?",
        "Buzz: Because you raised them to be strong and smart enough to take on the world. Good job.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Well, we made a pretty good team in Chicago together. You've got to admit that.",
        "Danny: Yeah. I have to say, for someone with no experience at undercover work, you were pretty impressive. And I'm a professional.",
        "Marina: Very nice.",
        "Danny: Hmm.",
        "Marina: Well, I just used my experience as a once aspiring actress and teenage heavyweight manipulator. I know how to wiggle my way out of situations.",
        "Danny: Yeah. No kidding. Nice changing of the subject.",
        "Marina: What subject?",
        "Danny: You know what subject. Being alone together in a hotel room. Do you care to comment? Or are you still avoiding?",
        "Marina: No, I'm not avoiding. I just don't think you know what kind of dangerous situation you might get yourself into.",
        "Danny: Oh, yeah? Really?",
        "Marina: Yeah, my family knows all about this. Two people work undercover together, there's pretty good odds of them falling in love, you know.",
        "Danny: Really? For example?",
        "Marina: Harley and Gus. Harley and Mallet. Mallet and whatever that piece of trash was he cheated on Harley with and...",
        "Danny: And...",
        "Marina: I can't believe it. It's staring me in the face: What I've always looked for my whole life.",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Marina: Come on, let's go.",
        "Danny: What? What is that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Poor waiter. Well, no use crying over spilled champagne.",
        "Cassie: I don't understand why you were so upset with Dinah about the speech she was going to make.",
        "Edmund: Dinah is the last person anyone wants to hear from tonight. It's our night, Cassie. Besides Dinah won't and can't ever bother us again.",
        "Dinah: One point for you, Eddie. No big deal. This party just getting...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Hey. Hi, Bill. Olivia. You guys are late.",
        "Olivia: Sorry.",
        "Bill: Well, I don't know. Beautiful people always show up late, don't you?",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) I know now. It's nice to see you, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: You, too.",
        "Bill: So what did we miss?",
        "Reva: You want the short version? One word: Dinah.",
        "Olivia: Oh, my crazy sister- in-law. I mean that with love.",
        "Bill: I know you do.",
        "Olivia: Oh, would you like a drink?",
        "Bill: Great.",
        "Olivia: Me too. You?",
        "Reva: No, I'm fine. Thanks.",
        "Olivia: Okay.",
        "Bill: Oh, so where's Josh?",
        "Reva: Business called away he went.",
        "Bill: Hmm. So that crazy man left you alone. My goodness.",
        "Reva: Yes, he did. Well, I'm not exactly alone. My new boss is here.",
        "Bill: Really?",
        "Reva: The one that I'm working at his bar?",
        "Bill: Oh, the... yeah, yeah, the... that's great.",
        "Reva: I'm sure Josh told you about him.",
        "Bill: He did.",
        "Reva: Yeah, I know. I'm sure he did.",
        "Bill: My goodness. Good for you.",
        "Reva: Thanks.",
        "Bill: That's great.",
        "Reva: Great.",
        "Bill: Well, is your boss here? Because I'd... I'd...",
        "Reva: Yeah, he's here somewhere.",
        "Bill: Is he really?",
        "Reva: You know what? I'm going to find him and I'll introduce you.",
        "Bill: You will?",
        "Reva: Yes.",
        "Bill: That's fantastic.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs )",
        "Olivia: Here you go.",
        "Bill: Hey, Honey. Guess what? Reva's new boss is here.",
        "Olivia: Oh. Oh, that's right. You've embraced your other bar maid.",
        "Bill: She's going to be good. I promise.",
        "Olivia: I'm going to be very good.",
        "Reva: Uh-huh.",
        "Olivia: And I want to meet him. So let's just bring it on.",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Olivia: Let's meet the new boss. To the new boss.",
        "Bill: To the new boss.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Well, you're back. In one piece.",
        "Danny: Buzz, I know what you're going to say.",
        "Marina: Don't apologize, Danny. I'm not sorry that we went and helped Harley. Now there's one less bounty hunter on her trail. We did good work. And we're ready for our next assignment.",
        "Danny: ( Laughs )",
        "Buzz: You sound like you're all warmed up to see your dad.",
        "Danny: Yes.",
        "Marina: You bet I am. Where is he? All right. Here goes nothing.",
        "Danny: This is going to be interesting.",
        "Marina: Stay back, Santos.",
        "Danny: Why?",
        "Marina: This is my meeting.",
        "Danny: Okay.",
        "Buzz: Once she makes up her mind there's no stopping her.",
        "Danny: Oh, yeah, believe me, I tried. She was good, though, I have to tell you. She was very natural at that little undercover work we did.",
        "Buzz: Yeah?",
        "Danny: Mm-hmm.",
        "Buzz: You know, since keeping her physically safe is out of your hands, I'd like you to make a promise that you can keep.",
        "Danny: If I can. Okay.",
        "Buzz: Don't hurt her. Just don't hurt her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Thanks for stopping by. Somebody from the department will be in touch. Go ahead and sit down. I'll be right with you.",
        "Marina: No rush, Chief.",
        "Frank: Marina.",
        "Marina: All right, you've got three minutes for the lecture. Go.",
        "Frank: That little trip that you pulled in Chicago was stupid.",
        "Marina: Was stupid and dangerous. And I could have gotten myself killed.",
        "Frank: Yeah, and guess what? You could have been killed.",
        "Marina: I know. But I didn't.",
        "Frank: Absolutely.",
        "Marina: And I'm fine. And I'm here. And I'm safe. And we helped Harley, too.",
        "Frank: That's debatable.",
        "Marina: And I would love to have that debate with you. But right now there's something more important that we need to talk about.",
        "Frank: Okay. What's on your mind?",
        "Marina: I want to be a cop.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: What did you mean when you said Dinah wouldn't be bothering us anymore? Where is she?",
        "Edmund: No idea. I assume she left when people stop listening. Perhaps she's at home sulking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: You're dying to know what I've got planned tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: It's unlike Dinah to disappear when she's got something to say.",
        "Edmund: How did you find us, Mr. O'Neil? I'm quite sure I forgot to mail your invitation.",
        "Cassie: You know what? Maybe she's in the bathroom. I'm going to check for her in there.",
        "Edmund: Good idea, Sweetheart. Likely she's sobbing theatrically in a stall somewhere. Nothing to worry about. Punch?",
        "Jeffrey: No thanks. What makes you so sure about that?",
        "Edmund: Well, I'm a confident man, Mr. O'Neil. That being said, thank you so much for dropping by to wish us well. But everything's under control. And I'm sure something needs prosecuting somewhere.",
        "Jeffrey: No, the prosecuting is all taken care of, Edmund. Thanks. I think I'll stick around.",
        "Edmund: Lucky me.",
        "Ross: Gentlemen, is everything all right?",
        "Edmund: Couldn't be better, Ross. Of course, I can't speak for Mr. O'Neil, but this is one of the happiest nights of my life. And getting happier by the minute. The man has finally realized when he's not wanted. Punch?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Hey. You all right?",
        "Cassie: Sure. No. I don't know, Jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: Dinah?",
        "Cassie: No one's seen her. We have to stop, please. Just stop.",
        "Jeffrey: What? Stop what?",
        "Cassie: Every time you look at me, I... I...",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie.",
        "Cassie: I can't think of anything else.",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie. Cassie. Cassie. Shh. Look. Look at me. Look at me.",
        "Cassie: No, I can't do this. I can't do this.",
        "Jeffrey: What is it? What?",
        "Cassie: This is the necklace I gave Dinah tonight.",
        "Jeffrey: Can I see?",
        "Edmund: What's the matter? Didn't Dinah like her necklace?",
        "Cassie: I guess not. I guess she just took it off and threw it on the floor.",
        "Jeffrey: No, I don't think so. This looks like it was ripped off of her. And not gently at that.",

        "Frank: No, no, it wasn't work. It was a fluke. And you're emotionally invested in this because you wanted to help your Aunt Harley. But guess what? When you do this job first time...",
        "Marina: I will be a happy girl. There's a whole division of young cops you sent out to schools and bars. Like 21 Jump Street. I'd be perfect for that. I'm a very good liar. Come on. Dad, just treat me like everyone else. Let me sign up and take the test.",
        "Frank: I'm sorry, Honey, but acceptance of recruits' applications is at my discretion. Come on, sweetie, can't you pick another job? Something that doesn't involve felons and guns? I mean, come on, have a little respect here.",
        "Marina: That should go both ways, don't you think, Dad?",
        "Frank: Where's all this coming from, anyway? Because last I heard, right, you wanted to go back to school. Didn't you want to take some theater with Tammy?",

        "Danny: Well, we all have that.",
        "Buzz: Some more than others. I know what it's like to love two women at the same time.",
        "Danny: Buzz, I'm not going to deny that Michelle is very important to me. She is. But she's also a part of my past.",
        "Buzz: Well, that's neat and tidy. But I've been looking at the calendar schedule of events for the restaurant the next month and I'm noticing in less than two weeks there's a holiday coming up.",
        "Danny: July 4th.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, 4th of July. Bauer Barbecue. I'm betting that Michelle is going to try and make it to the big event.",

        "Ross: Earlier this evening I overheard you threatening Dinah.",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Edmund: Oh, Ross, that is completely ridiculous. Dinah is carrying our child. No one cares more about her well-being than we do.",
        "Ross: I'm going to look for my daughter. I want you to wrap this up and do the same thing. Keep your cell phone on.",
        "Edmund: Politicians, all very excitable. As is Dinah. I'm sure there's a logical and simple explanation for all of this.",
        "Cassie: Well, what if there isn't, Edmund? What if she's hurt? And what about our baby?",
        "Edmund: Cassie. Cassie. Cassie, don't let Ross do this to you. It's Dinah. She's just trying to ruin your party.",

        "Jeffrey: Yes.",
        "Cassie: Is there anything you could do? Anything else?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I was thinking, you know, we could make a call and put out a missing person's report if you want.",
        "Edmund: ( Laughs ) Please. Please. You're overreacting. That's just not necessary. Cassie, Cassie, it's Dinah. It's Dinah. You know what she's capable of. It's one of her stunts. It's laughable. It's predictable. And so are we for listening to her every time she cries wolf.",

Please, please, for this sweet, innocent life that's growing inside of me. Please, if you're a common man with some shred of decency...",

        "Dinah: What? That was too much?",
        "Jonathan: It's like watching a train wreck. You call that acting? No. You hire me to make you look halfway believable. Take it again. From the top. This time try and sell it.",
        "Dinah: Ouch.",
        "Jonathan: Now remember, I'm the kidnapper, and it is the scared mommy.",
        "Dinah: Kidnapper and drama critic now. Hmm.",
        "Jonathan: Ha, ha. If we're going to make this work it's got to be real. Now, show me a motivation, okay? And dig in, get your hands dirty, make something happen. Grab it. Grab it. Make something...",

And you looked so handsome and I was so proud of you, knowing that your job was making people lives safer and better. And your extra badge? I brought it into school every Thursday for Show-and-Tell,week after week, even after Mrs. Cobb asked me to please bring in something else.",
        "Frank: Mm-hmm. And you see, Honey, and you didn't listen to her, now, did you?",
        "Marina: When I know it's right in my heart, it doesn't matter what anyone else says. Someone taught me that.",
        "Frank: Someone?",
        "Marina: My hero. Face it, Dad, it's in my blood. It's a family thing.",
        "Frank: Oh, Honey, you keep talking about families. I think you've seen firsthand what this job does to families. I chose this job because I wanted to make a good living. I wanted to provide for you and your mom. But this job... this job consumes you. It takes you over. And look what happened. I lost my marriage and I lost my little girl for a long time.",
        "Marina: And maybe I learned from your mistakes, Dad. So please just let me try.",
        "Frank: Okay, honey. I'll tell you what. You fill out the paperwork and we'll see what happens, okay?",
        "Marina: Thank you, Chief.",

        "Dinah: You know what? I am not going for an Oscar here.",
        "Jonathan: Huh.",
        "Dinah: And by the way. You know what? People believe what I dish out. Thank you very much. You know what? The necklace that you left behind, now that... that was a master stroke. Very good.",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) Yes, but we've all seen that movie before. And we've seen the remake. So it's time for a little 21st Century details.",
        "Dinah: Such as?",
        "Jonathan: Well, skin cells. ( Laughs ) Now, the more skin the better.",

        "Reva: You? Not necessarily. But Edmund is still Cassie's husband. Marriages go through phases. Believe me, I know that. But Cassie takes her marriage vows very seriously. Look, all I'm saying is that if you plan on getting involved...",
        "Jeffrey: I am involved, Reva. I'm involved.",
        "Reva: Okay, okay, then what I'm saying is just think about what your presence in her life means to her, how confusing that is. Edmund is still her husband and there you are, waiting, hoping that you can help throw all the pieces in the air. And look, I know that you understand what I'm saying.",
