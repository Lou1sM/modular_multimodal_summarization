        "Rutledge: What a beautiful day for your granddaughter's wedding, Mr. Spaulding. You must be a very happy man.",
        "Alan: Couldn't be happier.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: The Spaulding's certainly pulled this together in a hurry, didn't they?",
        "Olivia: Yeah, but this is very low-key for them.",
        "Frank: I guess you would know.",
        "Olivia: Don't start.",
        "Frank: ( Laughs ) Seriously, I mean, if Lizzie were marrying someone other than a Cooper, I'm sure Alan would have rented out the Taj Mahal.",
        "Olivia: I'm just trying to figure out, is this a happy occasion?",
        "Frank: I know some people aren't thrilled, but I'm really proud of Coop for standing up for his kid. I mean, what is more important than family, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: Here, it will calm your nerves.",
        "Marina: Nervous, who says I'm nervous? I'm not nervous.",
        "Alan-Michael: I am, so I thought you might be.",
        "Marina: You're nervous about Coop and Lizzie getting married?",
        "Alan Michael: No, that is what it is. I was nervous about seeing you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Well, well, well. Here he is, father of the groom.",
        "Buzz: Cool as can be.",
        "Alexandra: It looks lovely, doesn't it?",
        "Buzz: Well, you guys throw great parties.",
        "Alexandra: But you don't seem in the mood to celebrate?",
        "Buzz: You are?",
        "Alexandra: I am cautiously optimistic.",
        "Buzz: Good for you. Where's the bride?",
        "Alexandra: Well Lillian and Beth are helping Lizzie get dressed. So, where's the groom?",
        "Buzz: Good question. He disappeared while I was dressing. I haven't seen him since.",
        "Alexandra: Oh...",
        "Buzz: Oh, not to worry. He's not me. He'll be here.",
        "Alexandra: ( Laughs )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: It's for our baby, Coop. I'm pregnant. ( Echoing )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: We're really leaving town!",
        "Jonathan: You and me, enough of this town.",
        "Tammy: Who needs that stupid wedding, anyway?",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) Yeah, well, let's stop worrying about everything except us because when we get on that road, by tonight we are going to be far away from here.",
        "Tammy: Hmm, works for me. Pit stop before we go. I mean, what do we have to stay in Springfield for anyway? For my mom and your mom-- it's not like they're babies, they don't need us.",
        "Lizzie: In a couple of hours, it is going to be me, Coop, and the baby, for better or worse, till death do us part, okay. We are going to be a family, unless you do something to screw that up. So this is it, Jonathan. Promise me that you are going to walk away from this baby for good.",
        "Tammy: Hey, what are you thinking?",
        "Jonathan: I'm thinking you're right. I'm thinking that there is no reason for us to stay here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colin: Lie back. Keep her on nasal O2 at three liters and get an ABG. And keep an eye on her stats.",
        "Reva: It's just the flu.",
        "Colin: Please, Reva, be quiet. And call respiratory and get a nebulizer. And I want another chest x-ray on her.",
        "Reva: You know what? My first round of series chemo was a breeze compared to this.",
        "Colin: That's what I'm trying to tell you. The chemo has suppressed your immune system. That's why we're trying to get these antibiotics in you as fast as possible.",
        "Reva: Or what?",
        "Colin: Or things could rapidly progress in direction that we don't want them to.",
        "Reva: What does that mean? Are you saying I could die?",
        "Colin: I'm saying this is very serious, Reva. Please, lie back.",
        "Reva: I can't believe this is happening. I mean, I was coughing just a minute ago and now... (gasps )",
        "Nurse: Hold my hand and breathe.",
        "Colin: Upper fluids.",
        "Nurse: Deep even breaths.",
        "Reva: I'm freezing. I'm freezing. But I'm sweating. What is happening to me?",
        "Colin: Reva, listen to me, okay. You need to call someone and let them know you're here.",
        "Reva: You, you're here.",
        "Colin: No, a family member. Your husband.",
        "Reva: No!",
        "Colin: Yes, Reva, you have to let me call someone. You shouldn't be alone right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: There is nothing holding us here, so the sooner we get out, the better.",
        "Tammy: Whoa! ( Laughter )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Oh, sweetie, you look so beautiful. I know I keep saying it, but...",
        "Lizzie: Okay, let me guess: I'm glowing. How does my belly look?",
        "Beth: You're belly looks perfect.",
        "Lillian: Beth, I need some more bobby pins. Get me some, honey.",
        "Beth: Yeah. I don't see any.",
        "Lillian: Oh, there have to be.",
        "Lizzie: I think we might be out of them.",
        "Lillian: Out of bobby pins? I'm not even done. I want to make your beautiful hair perfect today, so I'm going to go get some, honey.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. Nana?",
        "Lillian: Yeah?",
        "Lizzie: I know that you have doubts about this, but you'll see. Coop is going to be a wonderful husband and a wonderful father, and we're going to be really, really happy.",
        "Lillian: That's really what I want for you, sweetheart.",
        "Beth: Don't worry, she'll come around.",
        "Lizzie: I just want nana and granddad to just be excited for me. I don't want anything to ruin this day.",
        "Beth: Nothing will. All of your friends and family are going to be around you to help you celebrate. And Jonathan and Tammy won't be here, and neither will Ava.",
        "Lizzie: What if Ava shows up?",
        "Beth: She won't. She won't. I took care of everything. Oh, sweetie, you're going to have the happiness that seems to have alluded being a Raines woman. You're going to have it. Well, we need to get you dressed. ( Knock on the door ) Oh, that was fast. Mom, it's open!",
        "Coop: Beth. Will you excuse us? We need to talk.",
        "Beth: Coop, you know that the groom is not supposed to see the bride before the wedding.",
        "Coop: Beth, I don't believe in superstitions. It's important, please.",
        "Lizzie: It's okay, Mom.",
        "Beth: Okay.",
        "Lizzie: What is it? Is it my grandfather?",
        "Coop: Well, he certainly is trying very hard to turn me into a Spaulding. That's not going to happen.",
        "Lizzie: Of course not. Don't worry, Henry, I have no desire to change you. I love you just the way you are. Maybe they'll play that at our reception.",
        "Coop: Maybe. Look, um, there's something else that I have to tell you. It's the real reason why I'm here.",
        "Lizzie: Okay.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, this is something that we need to be clear on, all right?",
        "Lizzie: Okay.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, um, I know it seemed for the last little bit while that things have been kind of complicated. My feelings have seemed probably divided.",
        "Lizzie: Coop...",
        "Coop: Look, I'm just saying that after today, you're not going to have to worry about doubting me again. Okay? You and I are going to be husband and wife. We're going to be married. And we're also going to be parents.",
        "Lizzie: ( Laughs )",
        "Coop: But from now on, that's all I'm going to think about, and that's all I'm going to care about, okay?",
        "Lizzie: I love you so much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: What is the hold up now? Well, keep me posted.",
        "Buzz: Got everything under control?",
        "Alan: You tell me, Buzz. Your son just barged in and demanded an audience with Elizabeth, and he kicked Beth out and now he and Elizabeth are talking.",
        "Buzz: Interesting.",
        "Alan: Interesting? Oh, come on, Buzz, don't be so annoying.",
        "Buzz: Sorry.",
        "Alan: Another Cooper- Spaulding union. God help us, Buzz.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Please, don't tell me that you were so anxious about seeing me that you had to toss back a couple. Please, Alan-Michael, that is such a line.",
        "Alan-Michael: Not a bad one, though.",
        "Marina: I noticed you didn't bring me here as your date.",
        "Alan-Michael: You would have said yes?",
        "Marina: It might have been fun to turn you down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: I can't believe she can't find a nice, decent, normal guy.",
        "Buzz: Well, at least they're not walking down the aisle.",
        "Frank: You got that right. Where you going?",
        "Buzz: I've got things to do.",
        "Frank: You need backup?",
        "Buzz: No, I got this one.",
        "Olivia: Are you and your dad okay?",
        "Frank: Um, I just think he's got something else on his mind right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: You're not going to tell Josh. You're not going to tell anyone.",
        "Colin: Reva, lie back, please.",
        "Reva: No.",
        "Colin: Be reasonable, okay? You said that you would keep this quiet until you couldn't anymore. Well, listen, you can't anymore, okay?",
        "Reva: If you take one step towards a phone, and I will run out of here. I mean it, I will.",
        "Colin: How are you going to leave, Reva, crawl? Look, I know how hard you have worked to keep your cancer from Josh, and I think you're crazy, but strange as it is, I sort of admire you, all that you've done. But now--",
        "Reva: You're not going to change my mind.",
        "Colin: Reva, I don't mean to scare you, but if these antibiotics don't help you, things could get worse for you very quickly. And if that should happen, I guarantee you, you will want your husband here.",
        "Reva: No. If you're half the doctor you keep bragging you are, you'll honor my wishes and not call my husband.",
        "Colin: Try to get some rest. I'll be back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: You know, we could have been on the road by now if you didn't distract me.",
        "Tammy: Me distract you?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. You want to distract me some more?",
        "Tammy: At this rate, we'll never get out of town.",
        "Jonathan: Okay, okay. I'll be good. I'll be a good boy. Um, I don't know. Maybe we could pull over on the side of the road and then--",
        "Tammy: I think we should probably hold out until we get where we're going. Where are we going?",
        "Jonathan: Who knows? I just figure we'll let the road take us where it takes us. Remember, Tammy, it's not the destination that is important. It's about what you've learned along the way.",
        "Tammy: Listen to you. ( Laughs ) You sound like someone's dad. So, ready to go?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, let's go. Let's get out of here. ( Telephone ringing ) Yeah.",
        "Colin: Mr. Randall, this is Dr. McCabe at Cedars.",
        "Jonathan: You're Reva's guy, right?",
        "Colin: Yes, her Oncologist. Could you come down to the hospital? I need to speak to you about something.",
        "Jonathan: Actually, I was just on my way out of town.",
        "Colin: Well, it's important, actually, it's very important. If you could just come down to the hospital, I can't explain it on the phone.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.",
        "Tammy: What was that all about?",
        "Jonathan: What else? Reva.",
        "Tammy: Who's her guy?",
        "Jonathan: Her assistant is making up some kind of emergency. Basically just because she wants to talk to me, so... sorry, but the sooner I handle this, the sooner we can hit the road.",
        "Tammy: It's okay. I have things I can do before we go. Don't take too long. The sooner we get out of here, the sooner we can distract each other again.",
        "Jonathan: I'll hurry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: There is a weird energy in here. Do you think they're actually going to go through with it?",
        "Frank: I don't know. Dad went off to talk to Coop, and I have no idea what that means. So uh-- no thank you.",
        "Olivia: Thanks. Is Coop getting cold feet?",
        "Frank: Oh, no way. Coop's pretty committed, that's for sure.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, but does he love her? Or does he love somebody else?",
        "Frank: I know Ava cares a lot about him. And I'm glad she's not here because seeing this would certainly break her heart.",
        "Olivia: That's so nice that you're concerned about her.",
        "Frank: We talked a little. I mean, I feel bad for her, you know. She's still new in town; she doesn't have any family and that whole mess with Sandy Foster, and now this. She's a great girl. I just feel bad for her, that's all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Coop, you have my promise that I am going to be a wonderful wife to you. Sit. And a wonderful mother to this child, our child. I know that if it wasn't for her, you wouldn't be here.",
        "Coop: Lizzie...",
        "Lizzie: No, just let me finish. I know that you had feelings for Ava, and I know part of you is wondering what might have been. But I honestly believe that everything happens for a reason. And I'm having this baby because somebody up there, they think that we deserve a second chance. And I know that you were in love with me once, and I believe that, in my heart, you will be again. We are going to have an amazing life.",
        "Coop: Hmm, well-- but, but, but...",
        "Lizzie: But?",
        "Coop: You... get over here. Come here. ( Laughter ) All right, you need to finish getting ready.",
        "Lizzie: I do, and I'm glad that you didn't see me in my dress, because the bad luck only counts if I'm in the dress.",
        "Coop: Uh-huh.",
        "Lizzie: Come here.",
        "Coop: What?",
        "Lizzie: This is going to be a great day. ( Laughs )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lillian: Beth, is something wrong?",
        "Beth: Oh, Coop came by to talk to Lizzie. He's in there with her now.",
        "Lillian: Oh. Well, I guess whatever will be, will be.",
        "Beth: Thanks.",
        "Lillian: Beth, it's hard enough to make a marriage work when two people are passionately in love. Look at you and Phillip.",
        "Beth: Yes, look at Phillip and me. Maybe it's better to go into a relationship with lower expectations.",
        "Lillian: Keep thinking that.",
        "Beth: I just want to support Lizzie. After everything she's been through, I just want her to have a happy life.",
        "Lillian: So do I, sweetheart.",
        "Buzz: Oh, hello.",
        "Lillian: Hi, Buzz.",
        "Buzz: Are both the bride and the groom in there?",
        "Beth: Yes, yes, do you have any idea what Coop would be talking about?",
        "Buzz: I haven't a clue.",
        "Beth: Well, he wouldn't call things off now, would he?",
        "Buzz: I-- ( stammering ) I don't think so, but you know, you never know.",
        "Coop: Hello.",
        "Buzz: Is everything all right?",
        "Coop: Yeah, everything is fine.",
        "Lizzie: It's better than fine. It's wonderful. It's almost time!",
        "Beth: Well, then, I guess we'd better get you dressed. ( Laughs ) Yes.",
        "Lillian: Thank you.",
        "Buzz: Uh-huh. So, everything is still on schedule?",
        "Coop: Yeah, yeah, everything is on schedule. So...",
        "Buzz: So?",
        "Coop: Come on.",
        "Buzz: Okay.",
        "Coop: Okay. ( Laughs )",

        "Colin: Mr. Randall, thanks for coming so quickly. Your mother had you down on her emergency form.",
        "Jonathan: Why didn't Reva call me herself?",
        "Colin: Well, your mother who's a very bad case of influenza.",
        "Jonathan: The flu, that's why you called me down here?",
        "Colin: No, no, no.",
        "Jonathan: You know I had a whole trip planned. I have somewhere to be.",
        "Colin: Well you said that on the phone.",
        "Jonathan: Where's Reva? Is she in there?",
        "Colin: Yes, she is, but--",
        "Jonathan: Okay, the flu. You know what? I'll stop in and say hi, but then I really got to get going.",
        "Colin: Before you go-- ( sighs )",
        "Jonathan: What is this?",
        "Colin: The course of chemotherapy has suppressed her immune system. In that weakened state, even the slightest infection can wreak havoc.",
        "Jonathan: Hey. Reva, can you hear me, Mom? Hey.",
        "Reva: When did you get here?",
        "Jonathan: Just now. When did this happen? The last time I saw you, you seemed fine. What's going on? What do you need? What can I do for you?",
        "Reva: I've already told you, what I've been telling you for weeks. Please, Jonathan, please, you have to acknowledge that you're the father of Lizzie's baby.",

        "Jonathan: It's happening, okay? Lizzie's going to marry Coop. It's going to be the best thing for everyone.",
        "Reva: That baby is yours. That baby is yours. You hated me when I walked away from you. And now you're doing the exact same thing. You know you're making a mistake. I can see it in your eyes.",
        "Colin: Jonathan, can I see you for a moment?",

        "Jonathan: I wasn't getting her agitated. She's agitating herself. So what's going on? You'll give her drugs to make her feel better, right? When's that going to start working?",
        "Colin: I can't say.",
        "Jonathan: You can't say. How long is she going to be in here?",

        "Colin: Jonathan, what I need to know for you is: Will you be here for her? You're the only person who knows she's ill. She shouldn't be by herself right now. Jonathan?",

Lizzie, I think Beth thought I was going to show up at the wedding and I don't raise hell or something. Oh, my God. After little Lizzie shows up here, shoving my nose in her happiness, acting like she won and I lost. I mean, it's like... it's unbelievable. I don't know. I mean I know you're friends with her, but this is just like--",

        "Ava: She acts like-- oh, my God-- like Coop is some sort of prize. You know, like she won him. You know what, he is a prize, Tammy, but not like that. He's a prize because of who he is.",
        "Tammy: I cannot believe they locked you in there. You've got to something about it.",
        "Ava: What am I going to do? It's my word against Beth's word. She's going to win. There is nothing I can do.",

        "Frank: I don't like it.",
        "Marina: Well, it's not real, Dad. Do you honestly think that I could be interested in him after everything he's done to our family? It'd be nuts!",

        "Marina: Are you happy?",
        "Coop: I am. It's my wedding day.",
        "Frank: I'll be right there. You know what, excuse me. I've got a little police situation here. So hopefully it won't take very long. Are you going to be okay?",
