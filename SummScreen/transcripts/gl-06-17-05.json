        "Alan: Really? ",
        "Sebastian: I had some thoughts about\r\ntracking down Harley. ",
        "Alan: There's been a change of plans. ",
        "Sebastian: Oh. Okay. ",
        "Alan: You remember one time you told me that\r\nyou would do anything for me, even if it meant crossing the line? ",
        "Sebastian: Yeah, that offer still stands. ",
        "Alan: Good. Because there's someone that's\r\ncausing a very big problem. ",
        "Sebastian: What kind of problem? ",
        "Alan: The kind of problem I don't want\r\nanymore. ",
        "Alexandra: After everything you have been\r\nthrough all those months in prison... all those months in prison swearing\r\nyou've changed. Yes. How could stand here, right here and let Buzz's life go\r\ninto... in the drain for heaven's sake when you hold the evidence right hands\r\nthat could clear Harley. Oh, you love your brother. Maybe that's it. Or maybe\r\nthat's your ticket back to the big time out of the mailroom, back at the...\r\nwell, either way you've made a decision. ",
        "Sebastian: This person is more important\r\nthan finding Harley? ",
        "Alan: For now? ",
        "Sebastian: Who is it? ",
        "Alan: Let's say that this someone is a very\r\nbig threat to Spaulding. ",

        "Dinah: He wants me to keep quiet. ",
        "Cassie: Why? ",

        "Harley: ( Bell ringing ) Can you help us? ",
        "Clerk: You checking in? ",
        "Harley: Are you crazy? My husband is so\r\ncheap, he's got us at the Dewdrop Inn in Newark. ",
        "Gus: What do you want a mint on your pillow?\r\n",
        "Harley: How about a map? He's too cheap to\r\nspring for that to. ",
        "Clerk: Where are you trying to go? ",
        "Harley: The Empire State Building. ",
        "Gus: Yeah, how far is she? ",
        "Clerk: She\u2019s... it's across the river in Manhattan. You're in Brooklyn. ",
        "Harley: Shut up. ",
        "Gus: Brooklyn. Well, we could see her from outside. ",

        "Clerk: Sir, I can't leave the desk. ",
        "Gus: Just for a second. How do I get to George Washington Bridge? ",
        "Clerk: Actually it's the Brooklyn Bridge you want. ",
        "Gus: Brooklyn? You sure? ",
        "Clerk: Sir, can I make a suggestion. ",
        "Gus: Sure. ",
        "Clerk: Take the subway. It's going to be a\r\nlot faster. ",
        "Gus: Take the subway. And get myself mugged.\r\nDid you see her? I mean, come on. Honestly. No, I'm not stupid. ",
        "Clerk: The crime rate is low as it's been\r\nin, like, 30 years. ",
        "Gus: Oh, all right. So in New York should I just get myself maimed instead of murdered.\r\nNo thank you. I'm not some dumb tourist. Sorry if I... ",

        "Alexandra: Did you or did you not just send\r\none of henchmen after Wallace? ",
        "Alan: Wallace lied to me. I paid the man to\r\ndisappear and he is still in New York. ",
        "Alexandra: So you send Roger Thorpe\u2019s son\r\nafter him? ",
        "Alan: That doesn't matter. The only thing\r\nthat matter is that Wallace doesn't tell Gus and Harley what he knows. ",
        "Alexandra: And what do you expect Sebastian\r\nto do? How's he going to handle that? ",
        "Alan: Well, that's up to Sebastian. ",

        "Coop: Freak. I was freaking not seeing you. ",
        "Lizzie: Really? ",
        "Coop: Yes, really. Come here. I missed you. ",

        "Lizzie: No, I'm not saying that at all. I\r\njust... you could have gotten caught. ",
        "Coop: I didn't, though. And I won't get\r\ncaught. Believe me, right now Alan\u2019s got so much on his mind, especially trying\r\nto railroad Harley to think about anything else. ",
        "Lizzie: I know. I wish I could change that.\r\nI do. I just... ",
        "Coop: Well, I wish you could change that,\r\ntoo. But I am happy that you finally came around. What the-- ",

        "Coop: What the hell? ",
        "Lizzie: Oh, my God. Are you okay? ",
        "Coop: Yeah, I'm okay. What is... this is\r\nanother room. ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. ",

        "Cassie: I saw what you wanted me to see. ",
        "Dinah: Okay, maybe. Maybe not. But that\r\nwould be a great excuse for you to keep your head in the sand. ",
        "Cassie: My head's not in the sand. And\r\nyou're not fooling me. ",

        "Dinah: For your family sake? So that you can\r\nhave a daddy for your children? Is that why? ",
        "Cassie: Yes. No. Dinah that is not the only\r\nreason. ",
        "Dinah: You know what it is. It's sad. That's\r\nsad to me. That you would actually think that you have a family just so that\r\nyou don't have to face the truth. I guess I understand it. I mean I should\r\nknow. ",
        "Cassie: Don't you dare compare us. ",

        "Lizzie: My parents used to always come up\r\nhere. My dad kind of made it his writing room and I guess they would come up\r\nhere to get away from the craziness of this place. ",

        "Lizzie: You know I never really understood\r\nit, but now I... I don't know. I guess I-- ",
        "Coop: Now you do, right? ",
        "Lizzie: I'm not the only one. It's like my\r\ndad is like that, Aunt Alex, my mom. That's why we have all these secret\r\nhideaway places to get away from it. ",

        "Coop: The big warehouse store. The store\r\nthat we always go to. What do you think? ",
        "Lizzie: Who picked this out? You or me? ",
        "Coop: No, you did. And you like it, too. ",
        "Lizzie: Okay, I guess it kind of goes in\r\nthis room. Although this room is filthy. ",

        "Coop: We? ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, me and my mom and my dad. It\r\nwas... my mom used to paint all day long and my dad, he would just write and\r\nsometimes he built furniture. You know, it was fun. ",
        "Coop: Sounds a lot like a movie. ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, it was great. I used to laugh\r\nso much. And ever since my dad left my mom, I don't think I ever heard her\r\nlaugh like that. ",
        "Coop: Lizzie, just because your parents had\r\nit rough, doesn't mean that you're going to be doomed at the same faith. Okay,\r\nwho knows, maybe... maybe you will end up in Arizona. Or maybe we'll take a trip and we'll go back there.\r\nYou never know. Why don't we do that? Why don't we go there right now? I want\r\nyou to tell me right now what the weather is like in Arizona.
