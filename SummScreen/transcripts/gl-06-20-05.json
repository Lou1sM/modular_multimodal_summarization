        "Edmund: You're...",
        "Dinah: In love with you. I've never made my feelings a secret to you.",
        "Edmund: Get away from me, Dinah. Just leave me the hell alone.",
        "Dinah: Edmund, now stop it. Just calm down. Take a breath, okay? You really... you really need to focus now because you need to face the truth, and the truth is your marriage to Cassie is over.",
        "Edmund: Because of you.",
        "Dinah: Oh, no, no, no. No, no, I am not the one that played Cassie against Alonzo so I could look like a big old hero.",
        "Edmund: Cassie would never have found out if you hadn't told her.",
        "Dinah: That doesn't matter. That doesn't matter, because all she saw was the shovel that you raised to my head. And she's never going to get that image out of her head. She's convinced deep down now that you are actually capable of harming the woman who is carrying your child.",
        "Edmund: Well, perhaps I am.",
        "Dinah: Stop! Would you stop? Don't be silly. Why... will you stop being angry at me for your mistakes and start thinking clearly? Cassie is out of your life. And I know that's painful.",
        "Edmund: Painful? Painful? Painful doesn't even begin to describe it, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: All right, you know what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But you've got to tell me, don't you feel just a little bit relieved? Relieved that you can finally stop pretending to be someone you're not? You are free. You are finally, finally free. Happy Independence Day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Wait, wait. Cassie. What is going on?",
        "Cassie: I want you. That's all you need to know.",
        "Jeffrey: You... you want me? What are you talking about?",
        "Cassie: Do you want me, too? Yes or no?",
        "Jeffrey: ( Sighs )",
        "Cassie: You're packing.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, I'm trying to. I'm going to make a clean getaway and put as much distance between us as possible.",
        "Cassie: No. No. No distance. Jeffrey, I want to be close. Close as we possibly can be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: This one's diet, right? Okay, how much do I owe you? That was quick. Hey, that's not yours.",
        "Jonathan: It is now. I paid for it. You're welcome, by the way.",
        "Tammy: Sandy's parking the car. I ordered that for him.",
        "Jonathan: I thought you two usually just ordered one and had two straws.",
        "Tammy: You know what? I'm glad you're here. I want some answers. You never told me what you were doing at Lewis the other day.",
        "Jonathan: Hello? We're off the clock. Can't we find something different to talk about? I mean, the parking lot's pretty full. We're going to have a few minutes to ourselves. Me and you can spend some quality time.",
        "Tammy: Sure, whatever. I'll find out one way or the other.",
        "Jonathan: No doubt, a smart girl like you. Aren't you afraid to be alone with me?",
        "Tammy: Well, one, we're not alone. And two, get it through your head once and for all, I'm not scared of you.",
        "Jonathan: Nor should you be. I'm an open book compared to Sandy. He's the one with all the skeletons rattling around in his closet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: ( Laughs )",
        "Gus: Maybe we should stop this.",
        "Harley: Oh, no, we rely should stop.",
        "Gus: You think so? We're supposed to be paying attention to the monitor in case our man comes walking through.",
        "Harley: We wouldn't want to miss him. No distractions. You're right, we really should stop this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You were just going to leave, just like that, without saying good-bye?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, I've tried to say good-bye, you know, a lot of times. It doesn't work, so I thought I'd try to make a clean getaway and make it stick this time, but here you are, again. We can't keep doing this, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: We don't have to keep doing this, Jeffrey, because I left Edmund and my marriage is over.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, right. Until you go back to him again, until you...",
        "Cassie: No.",
        "Jeffrey: ...Decide you need",
        "Cassie: I'm not going to need him again, Jeffrey, or want him. I get it now. Edmund has never changed and he never will.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, he's going to convince you otherwise, isn't he?",
        "Cassie: No, no. It doesn't matter. It's over. My marriage is over, and here I am.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, my... yeah, here you are. Here you are again.",
        "Cassie: Again. Again, because I can't stay away from you. It's different this time, it is, because I'm free, and I want to be with you. Don't you want to be with me?",
        "Jeffrey: You know I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Get away from me. For months, you've been trying to come between me and Cassie.",
        "Dinah: Or the other way you could look at it is that I helped you see the truth. You knew that the two of you would never work. Deep down you knew that the two of you wouldn't last. And now you haven't. Edmund, you heard her yourself. She couldn't have said it any clearer. Cassie doesn't love you anymore.",
        "Edmund: She's upset. She's upset, and I will get her back.",
        "Dinah: No. No, and that's good, because you deserve better. You deserve a woman who is going to admire your strength, support your dreams and your ambitions, and for the first time who appreciates you. Stop living in the past, Edmund, and look to the future. Open your eyes to the future and know that you can have it all, and a baby to actually seal it, a baby of your own. Everything you've ever wanted and needed, you just need to reach out and you need to grab it.",
        "Edmund: Grab it, Dinah? You? Grab you? There's one problem with your plan: I hate you. No, perhaps \"despise\" would be a better word. \"Loathe,\" perhaps?",
        "Dinah: Try \"love.\"",
        "Edmund: ( Laughs ) you are just... you have completely lost it.",
        "Dinah: Love and hate. They're both sides of the same coin. It's about passion and a desire that can't be ignored.",
        "Edmund: God, where do you get this stuff?",
        "Dinah: Because it's you that I've been waiting for my whole life. I know I'm not perfect, but you've been a friend to me. We know each other because deep down, we're the same. Your child is growing inside of me and I have wanted that. I've made no apologies for that. And I have put my heart and my soul and my pride on the line to make that happen. And I know that turns you on. Don't deny it.",
        "Edmund: Stop.",
        "Dinah: I know that turns you on...",
        "Edmund: Stop.",
        "Dinah: ...Because you have always been the pursuer, Edmund, and you've never gotten what you've wanted: Undying devotion. And you can have that inside of me. I want you to feel my pulse. Feel my heart, feel that racing. That's what you do to me. That's what you do to me, and I think about being with you all the time. And I want you to let me in and I want you to love me, because I promise you, you are not going to regret it. I promise you, you will never regret it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Jonathan, it's time to put the past behind you. Get over your grudge against Sandy.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy, the guy came to this town and for months passed himself off as me. He slept in my bed, he lived with my family, and then I show up and expose what a big liar he is and everybody still likes him more than they like me. I mean, talk about a con artist.",
        "Tammy: It takes one to know one.",
        "Jonathan: Who do you like better?",
        "Tammy: That's a stupid question.",
        "Jonathan: Is it? Okay, let me try a different one: What do you like about Sandy?",
        "Tammy: Sandy's a great guy.",
        "Jonathan: That's not an answer. Let me try again: What do you know about him?",
        "Tammy: I... ( sighs ) I know that I can count on him. He tries to make my days better.",
        "Jonathan: And I don't?",
        "Tammy: Sandy and I have a lot in common.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, that's what he'd like to have you think.",
        "Tammy: Stop it.",
        "Jonathan: No, Tammy, did you ever think that he's doing to you what I did to you? He's setting you up.",
        "Tammy: No, he wouldn't.",
        "Jonathan: Yes. He pretended to be me, just like he's pretending to be the perfect boyfriend right now. Why is he everybody's favorite? What did he do?",
        "Tammy: People make mistakes. Sandy's working hard to redeem himself.",
        "Jonathan: Even the name? Sandy Foster? Can you tell me that's a real name?",
        "Sandy: Hey, Jonathan. You must know something I don't know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: ( Laughs ) I thought... I thought we were going to stop this.",
        "Gus: Is that what you want?",
        "Harley: ( Laughs )",
        "Gus: All you have to do is say the word. If you want me to stop, I'll stop.",
        "Harley: Wallace.",
        "Gus: Wallace. We've got to go. We've got to go. ( Cell phone ringing )",
        "Sebastian: No worries, Alan. Everything's under control. I've got Wallace in my sight right now. I'll take care of him and then Harley. I assume \"dead or alive\" is still good with you, yes?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Baby. Come on. The coast is clear. Come on, let's go.",
        "Harley: I have the weirdest feeling that something is going to go horribly wrong.",
        "Gus: It's just your nerves.",
        "Harley: It's not my nerves. It's spooky. Listen, if something does happen out there....",
        "Gus: Nothing's going to go wrong.",
        "Harley: Just listen to me. Please don't try to make me feel better; just hear what I'm saying, okay? Tell the boys, tell my family how much I love them.",
        "Gus: Oh, my god!",
        "Harley: Promise me!",
        "Gus: Oh, my... yeah, yeah.",
        "Harley: And I love you too, okay?",
        "Gus: Listen, I love you. You don't have...",
        "Harley: But make sure the boys know this. Tell them I didn't do it. I didn't kill Phillip. You make sure they know that and tell them I'll always be with them.",
        "Gus: Listen to me. You'll be able to tell them this, okay, face to face. But you're not going to be able to unless you leave right now. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: This is what you can have with me. You can have this with me, okay? There's no more denying your urges. No more of that. There's nowhere we can't go. There's nothing we can't do. You are an amazing, powerful man, Edmund, and I'm going to make sure the whole world knows about it. You're going to be happy for the first time in your life, and all you need to do is say yes. ( Gasps )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Listen, you know I want you. I always have wanted you. But it's not going to work. Don't you understand? We've been here before, Cassie, and every time, you go back to him.",
        "Cassie: I'm not...",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, yes, yes, you go back. You always go back. So let's just spare us the agony and the heartache, please, okay? There's the door. Use it, or I will.",
        "Cassie: I'm not going back to Edmund. How many times do I have to tell you that? How many times do I have to say it, Jeffrey?",
        "Jeffrey: Now, what you say and what you do are two different things, aren't they? Besides, even if what you were saying was true...",
        "Cassie: It is true.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you'd be on the rebound, then, wouldn't you? Okay, I don't necessarily want to be in that place with you, with you on the rebound.",
        "Cassie: Why are you doing this? Why? Why are you doing this when I'm giving you what you have claimed to have wanted for months?",
        "Jeffrey: A lot longer than that.",
        "Cassie: All of a sudden you don't want it anymore? Why, Jeffrey? Why? What's happened? What, is there someone else? Have you changed your mind?",
        "Jeffrey: What do you think?",
        "Cassie: Then why are you pushing me away? Why are you pushing me away when we could finally be together? Unless that's not what you really want. Unless it's just been about the chase for you.",
        "Jeffrey: Now you're being ridiculous.",
        "Cassie: Well, you tell me, because I'm giving you what you want and all of a sudden, you don't want it anymore.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that's not it, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Well, then what is it, Jeffrey? Damn it, you tell me why you're pushing me away. Why? With everything that we've been through, if you're going to turn your back on me, then you owe it to me to tell me why.",
        "Jeffrey: It's not that I don't want you, Cassie, it's because I do want you, okay? I want you too much. And if we go down this road together, I'm never going to want to leave you. Do you understand that? I'll never let you go.",
        "Cassie: Then maybe I was just selfish, coming here and just...",
        "Jeffrey: Maybe you were.",
        "Cassie: Just assuming that you were just going to, you know... I'm just going to screw your life up.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, you're right. You'll just screw my life up. And now I'll never be the same again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: It's weird seeing you two out after curfew in a place like this.",
        "Tammy: This place is nice.",
        "Jonathan: If you say so. Places are a lot like people. They might look all shiny and nice on the outside, but you never know what's crawling around inside the walls. So, what are you two kids up to tonight?",
        "Tammy: Movies.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, if you don't want to go right home afterwards, I know of a great party not too far from here. It's kind of a rough crowd, but...",
        "Sandy: No. Thanks.",
        "Jonathan: Come on, man. Surprise Tammy. You used to roll around in the fast lane when you were at school. I mean, thanks to me, of course. Just take off that boy scout uniform and show her who you really are.",
        "Sandy: Tammy knows who I really am. But how about I surprise you?",
        "Jonathan: Go for it.",
        "Sandy: Why don't you come out and hang out with us? Come to the movies. We work together, right? But never hang out.",
        "Tammy: Do it. Come with us.",
        "Jonathan: Share popcorn with you guys?",
        "Sandy: Unless, of course, you have something better to do.",
        "Jonathan: As a matter of fact, I do. Thanks, but no thanks.",
        "Sandy: I tried. We better get going.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Well, you two kids have fun. Thanks for the invite.",
        "Tammy: We'll all go out after work sometime.",
        "Jonathan: Sure.",
        "Tammy: He wanted to come. He wants to be friends.",
        "Sandy: He wants to torture us and remind us that he's much, much cooler than we are.",
        "Tammy: No, I saw something else. He's lonesome, Sandy.",
        "Sandy: He brought that on himself.",
        "Tammy: Still.",
        "Sandy: Don't give in to him, Tammy. We both know that'll lead to nothing but trouble. Come on, let's go.",

        "Sebastian: Come on, Mr. Wallace. Finish your cigarette and cross the street. ( Car engine starts )",
        "Wallace: Oh, hey. It's you.",
        "Gus: That's right, it's me. Remember me, the guy you've been sending all the notes to about Phillip Spaulding's murder?",
        "Harley: Hello, Mr. Wallace. If you know something, I think you should tell us.",
        "Gus: Yeah, I think you should. Her life depends on it. Literally.",
        "Wallace: How much is it worth to you?",
        "Harley: You have information? Solid information?",
        "Wallace: Yeah, solid as it gets. I know who the shooter is. I can clear you.",
        "Sebastian: Well, what do you know? An extra pair of birds with one stone.",
        "Gus: So let me get this straight. You've been giving us all this crap, and now you want to charge us, too?",
        "Harley: How much? You name your price and you've got it. Let's just go somewhere and talk. You tell us who killed Phillip, and we will pay, I promise.",
        "Gus: All right, start walking. This way. ( Tires squeal ) ( crashing )",

        "Gus: I'm all right. Idiot cabdriver. New York city. Where's Wallace?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: It would never last. You would never be happy here with the picket fences and the Thanksgiving dinners with the Lewises. Why don't you get real? You knew it wouldn't last. That's why you sabotaged it.",
        "Edmund: I didn't.",
        "Dinah: Yes, you did. Yes, you did. You made mistake after mistake with Cassie because you didn't want to get caught. You wanted her doubt and all of her judgment out of your life.",
        "Edmund: Dinah, if I wanted to lose Cassie, why did I go to such great lengths to have a child with her?",
        "Dinah: That's my point. You're not having a child with Cassie; you're having it with me. So why don't we raise it together? Oh!",
        "Edmund: You know, Dinah? You are unbelievable. You ruined my life-- ruined my life-- and then you think you can just get away with it? Well, if you know me at all, Dinah, you know perfectly well that I am not going to let this go...",
        "Dinah: ( Gasps )",

        "Tammy: No, it was just still there on the bar. No one even took any money. ( Laughs )",
        "Sandy: Unbelievable.",
        "Tammy: Yeah. I probably just put it down when I went to pay for the drinks earlier, and then Jonathan paid, and I guess I got distracted.",

        "Sandy: I don't know. Why wouldn't you?",

        "Edmund: You two are very chummy, aren't you?",
        "Dinah: No, we are not! We're not.",
        "Edmund: So, are you the one who helped her stage this little kidnapping? Am I on point, Johnny-boy?",
        "Dinah: Stop it. No! Stop it! Stop it! You stop it! If you want to help me, you go! Now, you focus on me, and you listen to me, and you focus on the truth that you were about to see before he walked in the door. You, me, and this baby, we could be a family right now.",
        "Edmund: Oh, my god. You're insane. You're insane, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: No. No, you want this. You want this as much as I do. I know it. I know it.",
        "Jonathan: Would you stop begging him? You're pathetic.",
        "Dinah: Just shut up.",
        "Jonathan: No. He doesn't want you, and you should be grateful. Edmund's still hung up on perfect, blonde little Cassie. She dumped your butt, didn't she? Yeah. Oh, gee, I hope for Cassie's sake it doesn't take her too long to find a nice guy to help her pick up the pieces. Maybe a certain D.A. who bears an uncanny resemblance to her equally perfect poor dead hubby?",
        "Edmund: God. You miserable son of a bitch!",
        "Dinah: Edmund, will you put that down!",
        "Edmund: Get out.",
        "Dinah: You heard him. Go.",
        "Edmund: No. Both of you. Get the hell out of here.",
        "Dinah: I've offered you everything I have, all of me. What...",
        "Edmund: What could possibly make you think that I could ever love you, that I could ever find something in you worth loving? There is nothing, Dinah. Nothing.",
        "Dinah: You don't mean that.",
        "Edmund: As much as you want me, Dinah, I hate you. Now go. Go.",
        "Jonathan: Come on.",

        "Jeffrey: Do you have any regrets?",
        "Cassie: Hell, no. ( Laughs )",
        "Jeffrey: I do.",
        "Cassie: You do?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. That we didn't do this a hell of a lot sooner.",
        "Cassie: Do you know how long I've wanted to be with you like this?",
        "Jeffrey: Not as long as I have.",
        "Cassie: I don't know how long. No, I do. Since the first night you brought me here.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, now you're lying.",
        "Cassie: ( Laughs ) okay, so it was before then. But I didn't really think it was possible until that night.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, me too.",
        "Cassie: And you wrote me that beautiful song.",
        "Jeffrey: That's because I... I never thought I could have you. I never thought that I could have this.",
        "Cassie: If I would have showed up a half an hour later, you would have been gone. Would you have left me a forwarding address? Wow. I almost blew it. Would you have missed me?",
        "Jeffrey: Would I have missed you? Yeah. For a day or two at least.",
        "Cassie: Come on. You need me. I'm your muse. I'm your Mona Lisa. Without me, the music stops.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, you think so?",
        "Cassie: ( Laughs ) I think that you probably have a box full of love songs you've written for all the women that you've had in your life.",
        "Jeffrey: No, Cassie Winslow, you were the first.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, right.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, maybe I might have, you know, written a couple of love songs before, but they were all for you. I just, you know, didn't know it at the time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Hi. Excuse me. We were witnesses to that hit- and-run and we followed the ambulance. We were just wondering how he was doing.",
        "Nurse: Well, he just went into surgery, so we won't know until he gets out, but between me and you, it doesn't look good.",
        "Harley: If he doesn't make it...",
        "Gus: Baby, he's alive, okay, so there's hope.",
        "Harley: And that car sure came out of nowhere, huh?",
        "Gus: Nice coincidence. Just like the coincidence with the fire alarm going off at the hotel.",
        "Harley: I told you. And you know what? The guy who was driving that car is probably Phillip's shooter, and he knows we're here now. He saw us.",
        "Gus: All right, well, good. Good.",
        "Harley: Good?",
        "Gus: Yes, good. Let him chase us until we catch him. Let's go talk to the nurse and maybe get some more information out of her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Are you all right? You're sad. You don't have to hide it from me. I know you had this dream of what your life would be, and all that's changed now. Cassie, I wish I could have protected you better.",
        "Cassie: I wouldn't let you. I had to figure it out on my own, in my own time. But I have. I'm not sad.",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie.",
        "Cassie: I'M... ( sighs ) okay, maybe I'm sad that I didn't realize this sooner, that I didn't see what you and everyone else saw. Because then I would have been here a lot sooner.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, then stay with me now. You told me that R.J.'s staying with the Marlers and Tammy's okay, so you have... you have nowhere else to be except for right here in my arms.",
        "Cassie: Hm. Okay.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay?",
        "Cassie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that was easy.",
        "Cassie: ( Laughs )",
        "Jeffrey: You'll stay?",
        "Cassie: I'll stay. You wrap your love around me like a big, warm blanket, and you make me feel safe, and you love me and accept me for who I am. And I want to spend every day of the rest of my life making you happy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: I'm going to go back in there and talk to Edmund...",
        "Jonathan: Are you nuts? Dinah, the guy doesn't want you.",
        "Dinah: Yes, he does.",
        "Jonathan: No! N-O. Man, you're the biggest masochist I know.",
        "Dinah: No, he's just angry. I need to talk to him. I need to calm him down and make him understand why I love him.",
        "Jonathan: I think he gets that you love him. I just think he doesn't care less. He doesn't want you, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: Why would... what are you doing here anyway, huh? Jonathan? Did I ask you to rescue me? Do you know I was going to get through to him before you barged in?",
        "Jonathan: I was trying to help you.",
        "Dinah: Do you know what? Do me a favor: Don't help me anymore. I am a big girl. You're poison, and you screw up everything you touch.",
        "Jonathan: Fine. Fine. Go back in there and get beat up. See if that'll make him love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: You have been so helpful, dear. Thank you so much. \"Mr. Wallace made it through surgery.\" Why couldn't you just die, dude?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: What's the matter, babe? Your neck?",
        "Harley: Oh, just a pulled muscle, that's all. It'll go away. How many more people are going to get hurt in this thing? You know? Wallace is in there, he's fighting for his life. Lena's dead. Mallet's in prison; his life is just ruined. It's all my fault.",
        "Gus: No, the person who pulled the trigger, they're the person that's responsible for all of this, not you, okay?",
        "Harley: Then why do I feel so guilty?",
        "Gus: Because you're a good person. You've got a conscience. The best person I've ever met. Stay here for a second. All right, he just came out of surgery, so let's go and see if we can talk to him.",
        "Harley: Oh, my god.",
        "Gus: What? It's not that bad. He's going to be fine.",
        "Harley: Oh, my god. Gus, this was my last chance. This was my last shot at getting my name cleared from Phillip's murder and going home to my kids, and... look at him.",
        "Nurse: We need some contact information for you, Mr. Wallace. Good lord.",
        "Harley: Nurse, can I see Mr. Wallace's chart?",

        "Reva: I'm fine, and josh and I are fine.",
        "Jonathan: It's my cousin Tammy. She saw me near the computer. I think she's been following me.",
        "Nate: You do something about her, or I will.",
        "Tammy: ( Gasps )",
        "Jonathan: Hey, Tammy. What are you doing following me?",
        "Harley: If we'd gotten there ten seconds earlier, he could have told us what he already knows. I want to go home, Mr. Wallace. Can't you help me go home?"
