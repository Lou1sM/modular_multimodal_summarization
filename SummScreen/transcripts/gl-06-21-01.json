        "Reva: Noah, it's me. God, I hate answering \r\nmachines. I know you're undercover and all, but I... Still can't believe \r\nRichard's gone, and I want to come down there, okay? I want to come down and \r\nbring Cassie home. ",
        "Marah: Mom, can I get you something to eat? \r\nYou haven't eaten anything since you heard. ",
        "Reva: No, sweetie, thanks. I'm really not \r\nhungry. ",
        "Marah: I want to come to the funeral with \r\nyou. ",
        "Reva: Oh, Marah, no, honey. You can\u2019t. \r\n",
        "Marah: Why not? I'm great at funerals. You \r\nknow what I mean. I'd be very supportive. ",
        "Reva: Sweetie, it's your senior year. You \r\nonly have a few more days of classes before graduation. ",
        "Marah: Signing yearbooks does not compare \r\nwith losing somebody. Somebody that you shared so much with. ",
        "Reva: Okay. What is this really about? What \r\nhappened? Is it Tony? ",
        "Marah: Dad offered him his job back. \r\n",
        "Reva: Well, that's good. ",
        "Marah: And Tony refused. ",
        "Reva: Oh, not so good. ",
        "Marah: He doesn't want to have anything to do \r\nwith my family or me, especially me. ",
        "Reva: Oh, Marah, things have a way of \r\nchanging in a heartbeat. ",
        "Marah: Yeah, maybe, if it was just me and \r\nTony, but there's someone else involved... ",
        "Reva: Sam? ",
        "Marah: Mom, Sam\u2019s my friend. ",
        "Reva: Well, maybe to you. ",
        "Marah: That is what he is. ",
        "Reva: Okay, then what's the problem? \r\n",
        "Marah: Catalina. ",
        "Reva: Ah, Tony likes her? ",
        "Marah: She likes Tony, big time. ",
        "Reva: Oh, well, then there's really nothing \r\nto worry about because Catalina would... ",
        "Marah: Would never stab me in the back with a \r\nnail file, no. ",
        "Reva: No, Marah, that doesn't sound like \r\nsomething... ",
        "Marah: ... The girl that he rescued and \r\nbrought her home and got her a green card, no, she wouldn't want to steal my \r\nboyfriend, too, would she? ",
        "Reva: Sweetie, I think you're \r\nmisinterpreting. ",
        "Marah: Mom, I know that you want to think the \r\nbest of her. But she has wanted Tony ever since she laid eyes on him, and now \r\nshe thinks that this is her chance. ",
        "",
        "Michelle: Don't stop on my account. \r\n",
        "Danny: Oh, you don't need to worry about that \r\nanymore. The surveillance van is gone. ",
        "Michelle: So the 20 laps you're doing around \r\nthe kitchen is just for fun? ",
        "Danny: I'm fine. ",
        "Michelle: We're a long way from fine, aren't \r\nwe? ",
        "Danny: How'd you sleep? ",
        "Michelle: Not very well. I just kept waking \r\nup trying to put it all together. ",
        "Danny: Put all what together? ",
        "Michelle: How Aitoro after months of \r\ninvestigating us all of a sudden gets inspired to drag the water around the \r\ndocks. ",
        "Michelle: Someone tipped him off. ",
        "Danny: Yep, that's what I figure. ",
        "Michelle: And that someone was Claire. \r\n",
        "Danny: You think so? Really? ",
        "Michelle: She's the one who helped Carmen \r\nfake her death in the first place. You just caught her wearing a wire for \r\nAitoro. It's not that great of a leap to assume that Claire's the one who tipped \r\nhim off. ",
        "Danny: No, I... I don't think so. I think it \r\nwas Carlos. Honey, both he and Abuela knew that Carmen was still alive. Carlos \r\nprobably lined up those guys to kidnap you from the hospital. Abuela knew that \r\nCarmen took you to the docks. I'm sure she told Carlos. ",
        "Michelle: Yeah, but what about our insurance \r\npolicies? Carlos knows better than to hurt us. ",
        "Danny: Right, right, and what better way for \r\nhim to get rid of those policies hanging over his head, then making an anonymous \r\ncall to the feds, tipping them off and keeping his nose clean at the same time.\r\n",
        "Michelle: We can still find our way out of \r\nthis, can't we? ",
        "Danny: In the meantime, for now, just forget \r\nabout Claire. She's tipped her hand at us. She knows that we're on to her. She \r\ncan\u2019t... Hurt us anymore. ",
        "",
        "Russo: You sit here. I'll go in and nail down \r\nwhat he expects from you on the grand jury stand tomorrow. Your job is to take a \r\ndeep breath. Don't be nervous and be firm. ",
        "Claire: Yeah, I could say the same to you.\r\n",
        "Russo: I'm sorry? ",
        "Claire: When you go in there, would you \r\nplease get it in writing this time? I will not let that storm trooper put a \r\nlightsaber in my back again. ",
        "Russo: You don't have to remind me of my job, \r\nClaire. I'm here to take care of you. You have nothing to worry about. \r\n",

        "Ross: Hello? Hello? You're going to have to \r\nspeak up. I can't hear a word you're saying. Who is this, and why are you \r\ncalling at this ungodly hour? ",
        "Gus: Oh, good morning, this is your \r\nunofficial wake up call, courtesy of the F.B.I. ",
        "Ross: That's about the only thing the F.B.I. \r\ncan get right these days. Is this your idea of a joke? ",
        "Gus: No, I just wanted to give you a little \r\nheads up that the grand jury will be convening this morning. ",
        "Ross: So soon? How'd you manage that? \r\n",
        "Gus: Well, the D.A.'S just as anxious as I am \r\nto get started. As a matter of fact, I think we might even have an indictment by \r\ntonight. But you know what, why don't you get your sleep and have sweet dreams \r\nwhile you're at it? ",
        "Ross: Oh, this is not the way I wanted to \r\nstart our morning.\u00a0 ",
        "(Call ends)",
        "",
        "Gus: Take your corners, ladies, please. All \r\nright, I\u2019m going to make this as quick as possible, okay? When you go in front \r\nof the grand jury, you are going to tell the truth. You're going to tell nothing \r\nbut the truth and you're going to help us take Danny Santos down. If you tell \r\none lie, one little tiny lie, the deal is off. You can trade in your hospital \r\nwhites for little orange jumpsuits. As a matter of fact, we got a little orange \r\njumpsuit for Michelle as well, okay? ",
        "Claire: You said that you would protect \r\nMichelle... ",
        "Gus: And I will as long as you go in there \r\nand do your job, you've got a bargain. You got my word on it. ",
        "Claire: Thanks, but I trust that piece of \r\npaper a lot more than your word. ",
        "Gus: Thank you. ",
        "Russo: See you downtown. ",
        "Harley: It doesn't bother you that your case \r\nrests on the word of a woman who would betray her own daughter? ",
        "Gus: Not as long as she's on our side. \r\n",
        "Harley: Claire only has one side: Her own.\r\n",
        "Gus: I would call that instincts. It's just \r\nself-preservation. At least she's not trying to slow the investigation down.\r\n",
        "Harley: And you think I am? ",
        "Gus: (Stammering) I'm not trying to pick a \r\nfight with you, okay? I am simply trying to make an observation here. I have \r\nnever had a partner that never saw eye to eye with me like this before. I've \r\njust... I've never experienced it. ",
        "Harley: You have never worked on a case where \r\nyou couldn't bully your partner into blindly believing everything that you \r\nsay... ",
        "Gus: No! No, no, no, I just think that you \r\nmix up your personal friends and your professional life. I think the whole \r\nthing's a big blur to you. ",
        "Harley: Me? ",
        "Gus: Yeah! ",
        "Harley: Are you joking? ",
        "Gus: In all fairness to you, maybe it is... \r\nMaybe it is the pregnancy. Maybe it's your hormones. Maybe it's your... \r\n",
        "Harley: Well, then what's your excuse? Are \r\nyou pregnant, too? ",
        "Gus: (Sighs) Look, maybe we should just get \r\nRick down here, the doctor, okay, maybe he can check us both out. ",
        "Harley: What is that supposed to mean? \r\n",
        "Gus: He's the only other doctor I know \r\nbesides Claire Ramsey. I don't know, and he seems to know you inside and out. \r\nIt's a joke, all right? It's just a joke. I'm joking! ",
        "Harley: I'm ignoring you. You know, you tell \r\nme that I have no objectivity? You are obsessed. You are obsessed, and not just \r\nwith Danny, with the whole Santos family. ",
        "Gus: No, it's not an obsession. It's a case.\r\n",
        "Harley: What, did you lose control of your \r\nhighlighter? Look at this. ",
        "Gus: This is research, okay. This is the \r\nSantos bible. I mean, whoever got into this information, knows the family well. \r\nWell. They are in this family. ",
        "Harley: Aitoro, even if... Even if this book \r\nwere not a work of fiction, which it is, it has no bearing on our case. \r\nEverything in it happened in the past. ",
        "Gus: It has some bearing on the case. This is \r\nnot the past. This is happening now. There is not statute of limitations on \r\nmurder, Cooper. ",
        "Harley: So what are you going to go after all \r\nof them? Are you going to go after the whole family, not just Danny? ",
        "Gus: Oh, look at that. What is that? That \r\njust ruins your whole idea of personal vendetta that i have, didn't it?\r\n",
        "Harley: No, it just widens the net. You are \r\nnot normal. ",
        "Gus: Let me explain something to you. With a \r\ncrime family, you can never get them, you can never bust them on the worst thing \r\nthey did, because they're too clever. You can never get the real dirt. Nobody \r\never gets close enough. But with Blake, she got in closer than anybody has ever \r\ngotten in before and lived to tell the tale.If I can get to that source, that is \r\nthe end of the Santos family, period. ",
        "Harley: You know, when I told you to read \r\nthis book, I... You know, you are just demented. Thats it. ",
        "Gus: Well, maybe that's what makes me so good \r\nat my job. ",
        "Harley: Cooper. You. Hello? ",
        "Gus: Just patch it over, would you? Aitoro. \r\nYeah, no, that's in the mail. No. All right. Okay, you got me. It's not in the \r\nmail. I just have a few \"i's\" to dot and some \"t's\" to cross, I\u2019m just trying to \r\nmake it foolproof, that's all. Yeah, no Santos size loopholes, you know? \r\n",
        "",
        "Ross: Yes, I know. It's a lot to research, \r\nbut we're up against it, aren't we? I mean this is going before the grand jury \r\nlater on today. Well, you keep doing that. Have Susie take care of the paper \r\nwork, and I'll be in well, whenever I can be in. I have something I have to take \r\ncare of. All right. You do that. Bye. Blake? Ah, well. ",
        "Blake: Don't even think about picking up that \r\nphone. ",
        "Ross: Well, thank heaven. It's about time.\r\n",
        "Blake: Just rescued from a pile of legal \r\nbriefs. ",
        "Ross: Yeah, I\u2019m afraid you did. You're my \r\nhero. ",
        "Blake: What's wrong? ",
        "Ross: It's Danny and Michelle. Their case is \r\ngoing to go up to the grand jury later on today, probably. ",
        "Blake: I'm sorry. ",
        "Ross: And here they've just started this \r\nfamily, with this beautiful little boy. Now their fate is going to be decided in \r\na court room. ",
        "Blake: You're going to help them out of this \r\nbecause you are the best lawyer in the world. ",
        "Ross: I just want to be the best lawyer for \r\nthem in this case. How did our bed get so full? ",
        "Blake: I don't see anybody else in it right \r\nnow. ",
        "Ross: Well, i do. It's cluttered with \r\ncClarissa, and Kevin, and Jason, and your publisher, and your editor, and all my \r\nclients, led by Michelle and Danny. ",
        "Blake: Oh, listen, if you're feeling guilty \r\nabout our anniversary celebration being interrupted, don't, because... \r\n",
        "Ross: Oh, no, no, no. Actually, I was glad \r\nfor the interruption. ",
        "Blake: You were? ",
        "Ross: Yeah. ",
        "Blake: I was kind of thinking you were \r\nleading up to something important, but I guess you changed your mind. \r\n",
        "Ross: The only thing that is changed is the \r\nlocation, and for the better, too. And this is the perfect place for me to \r\nfinish what I started on our anniversary. ",
        "Blake: Oh Ross. ",
        "Ross: Ever since we got back together, you \r\nhave been telling me in big ways and little ways, but mostly it's in your look, \r\nthat says that you love me and now it's my turn. And I hope you don't mind if I \r\nframe this in the form of a question. (Phone rings) ",
        "Blake: No, I don't mind at all. We're not \r\ngetting that. ",
        "Ross: Would you... I can't do this... (Phone \r\nrings) ",
        "Blake: Where's the machine? I'll get rid of \r\nthem. We're not home right now. ",
        "Reva: Blake, it's Reva. I'm sorry. I should \r\nhave called you before, but I just didn't feel ready to tell anyone or talk \r\nabout it until someone convinced me otherwise. ",
        "Blake: Ready for what? What? Is it Cassie?\r\n",
        "Reva: You don't know? ",
        "Blake: Know what? ",
        "Reva: You're the first person I\u2019ve actually \r\nhad to tell. Richard's dead. ",
        "Blake: (Stammering) I don't understand.\r\n",
        "Reva: Dax killed Richard to protect Edmund. I \r\nmean, the official report is that Richard pulled a knife on Edmund, but...\r\n",
        "Blake: That doesn't make sense. I don't \r\nbelieve that. ",
        "Reva: I know. ",
        "Blake: This is terrible. What about cassie?\r\n",
        "Reva: Well, no one really knows anything \r\nabout her yet. But if she knows what really happened to Richard, then god knows \r\nwhat Edmund is going to do. ",
        "Blake: Sit tight. I'm going to be right \r\nthere, Reva. ",
        "Ross: Tell me. ",
        "Blake: Richard's dead. ",
        "Ross: Oh, dear god. How? ",

        "Ross: Dax? ",
        "Blake: I don't know. I don't know. That's \r\nwhat I'm going to find out. I'm going to go over to Reva's right now. \r\n",
        "Ross: I'll get dressed; I\u2019ll drive you over.\r\n",
        "Blake: You know what? I'm going to be okay. I \r\ndon't know what I would do if anything ever happened to you. ",
        "Ross: I feel the same way about you, honey. \r\nAre you going to be okay? ",
        "Blake: Yeah. As long as I have you. And Ross, \r\nwhatever you were going to ask me before? Yes. The answer is always yes. \r\n",
        "",
        "Russo: Claire, what you're asking me, I \r\nunderstand your impulse, but it will not be easy to honor your request. \r\n",
        "Claire: You know what? Alan doesn't pay you \r\nfor easy. If Michelle were to testify about destroying the FBI's evidence \r\nagainst the Santos\u2019s, she'd walk, right? ",
        "Russo: Not exactly. Once she's on that stand, \r\nthe D.A. has the right to ask her anything and everything about the case \r\nrelating to Danny. ",
        "Claire: What if she refuses to answer a \r\nquestion? ",
        "Russo: It's a grand jury. There's no taking \r\nthe fifth. It's full disclosure. ",
        "Claire: She could stretch the truth. \r\n",
        "Russo: If she gets caught in a lie, she's in \r\nmore trouble than she is in already. It's contempt, it's perjury. ",
        "Claire: So in other words, they're expecting \r\nMichelle to be the last nail in Danny's coffin. ",
        "Russo: Anything less, she goes to jail.\r\n",
        "Claire: So if she testifies truthfully, she's \r\nfree? ",
        "Russo: Yes, but... ",
        "Claire: That's all I need to know. \r\n",
        "Russo: Correction. What you need to know is \r\nthat she'll comply. And this is not your deal to make. It's Michelle\u2019s. \r\n",
        "Claire: You handle Aitoro. I will handle my \r\ndaughter. ",

        "Danny: Honey, come on. I'm guilty. \r\n",
        "Michelle: You were defending my life. You \r\nknow what? That's what we have to prove. We have to prove that you were \r\ndefending me and the baby. ",
        "Danny: No one but no one was there to see it. \r\nWho would believe us? ",
        "Michelle: That's not true, actually. There \r\nwere those two kidnappers who kidnapped me from the hospital. They could testify \r\nto the kidnapping and I could testify to the rest. ",
        "Danny: No. Look, even if we could find them, \r\nlet's say, they're not going to testify. They wouldn\u2019t. ",
        "Michelle: Why not? They don't have to worry \r\nabout betraying Carmen. ",
        "Danny: Because they're not going to testify \r\nagainst any member of any crime family, even if that person is dead. That's how \r\nthe code of silence works. ",
        "Michelle: It is worth a try, isn't it, Danny? \r\nWith my testimony there's a chance that we could... ",
        "Danny: Honey, with your testimony? You've \r\nbeen on the stand before. And even with your reputation, your Bauer reputation, \r\nyou were convicted of a crime that you didn't even commit. These guys I\u2019m sure \r\nhave rap sheets a mile long. Who's going to believe anything that they say?\r\n",

        "Marah: But she... ",

        "Blake: When's the funeral? ",
        "Reva: Tomorrow. ",

        "Reva: Yeah, well, that'll never happen.\r\n",
        "Blake: What about Cassie? Have you heard \r\nanything? All right. We have to go down there. Now. ",
        "Reva: Marah, you know, sweetie, I really am \r\nfeeling a little hungry. Could you maybe get me something to eat? ",
        "Marah: Yeah, that's the code for all children \r\nout of the room. Technically, I\u2019m an adult, mom. ",
        "Reva: I know. But you'll always be my child.\r\n",
        "Marah: Even though I think I\u2019m old enough to \r\nhear this, I'll go, I\u2019ll go. ",
        "Reva: I don't think I\u2019ll ever be old enough \r\nfor this. This wasn't Richard's time. ",
        "Blake: What didn't you want Marah to hear?\r\n",
        "Reva: About the funeral. I told her that she \r\ncouldn't go down there. ",
        "Blake: Well, that's understandable. \r\n",
        "Reva: And Blake, I know that you want to go \r\nas much as I do, but I know you want to say good- bye to Richard, and I know you \r\nwant to bring Cassie home, but it's not as simple as all that. (Phone rings) \r\nHello? ",

        "Noah: Well, you're on the other end of the \r\nline. You make it easy. ",

I went to the \r\nvictim's wife and I asked what did her husband do that morning, the morning that \r\nhe got killed. Well, it turns out that he went to the race track. And as the \r\nstory unfolded, we found out the heads of all the other crime families were also \r\nat the race track. And at the end of the day, we got our man. And we were able \r\nto take down one of the biggest crime syndicates in Chicago, and that is how it \r\nworks! ",
