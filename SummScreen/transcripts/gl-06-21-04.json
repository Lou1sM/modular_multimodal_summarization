        "Olivia says she's only looking out for Emma when talking to Bill. She tries to get Bill to share his Spaulding stock with her so they can have joint power. She's desperate to gain control over Philip. Later, Bill tries to become business partners with Philip. Philip convinces Beth to \"oversee Emma's care\" and hire Emma's new nanny. Beth firmly states that she will neither keep Olivia from Emma nor manipulate Olivia in any way. Olivia hates the idea of Beth looking out for Emma, but changes her mind. She can put more focus on Emma's future since someone's caring for Emma and she doesn't have to worry about Philip taking Emma away. Harley stresses over her wedding plans. She's worried about her marriage to Gus. Gus insists on looking through Brad Green's box of things. He finds incriminating evidence against Alexandra, but he keeps it to himself after confronting her. Gus stops Harley from taking and looking though the box. Michelle, having just come out of her coma, has amnesia. She only vaguely remembers Tony. Rick explains that she'll have long-term memory loss. It may not even come back at all. Tony explains to Michelle how he saved her from the warehouse explosion. Danny is determined to get Michelle to remember him and their love for each other."

        "Tony: I can't believe you're awake, Michelle. Hey, listen. Don't move, okay? Please don't move.",
        "Michelle: Don't worry.",
        "Tony: I'm going to go get Danny. Hold on. Danny? Danny? Michelle's awake. She's awake. Get inside. Come on.",
        "Danny: Oh, my god. Hi. Oh, god. Oh, god, you came back to me. Oh. Oh, god, you came back. Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: We can dance around this all day, or you can just simply tell me what you know. Who's buying up Spaulding stock?",
        "Bill: Well, how important is it to you?",
        "Olivia: It has the potential to change my entire future.",
        "Bill: Hm. Sounds like you'd pay a hefty price for that information.",
        "Olivia: Or I'd be willing to share the rewards.",
        "Bill: Ah, always seeing dollar signs, huh, Olivia?",
        "Olivia: I'm doing this for my daughter.",
        "Bill: Well, something tells me your daughter doesn't need you doing this.",
        "Olivia: Let me guess. She's a Spaulding. She'll always be taken care of.",
        "Bill: Something like that.",
        "Olivia: Yeah. Well, in this family, Bill, being taken care of means being under Phillip or Alan's control, and I don't want that for Emma. I don't want that for myself.",
        "Bill: Well, it looks like I'm in the driver's seat. You'd probably promise me almost anything.",
        "Olivia: You own the stock.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: Beth, I'd like you to meet Ms... I'm sorry. Murph. Just Murph. Murph is here to apply for the nanny position.",
        "Beth: Really?",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm. She's worked for some of the finest families in the country.",
        "Beth: Ah. I see you're a former marine.",
        "Murph: Semper fi.",
        "Beth: Right back at you.",
        "Murph: Child rearing, the military, it's all about discipline.",
        "Phillip: Yes. Well, why don't you wait in the living room, and I'll bring Emma down in a few minutes. What do you think? I know she's a little gruff, but she has excellent credentials.",
        "Beth: What are you doing?",
        "Phillip: I'm hiring the best caretaker for my daughter.",
        "Beth: No, you're not. You're hiring a bodyguard so you can keep Olivia away from her child.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: I heard purple is a very big color this year.",
        "Harley: What does that even mean?",
        "Frank: I don't know. It just sounded wedding-ish. (Laughs)",
        "Harley: What about these wedding phrases? \"Time crunches.\" \"Difficult decision making.\" \"Pressure.\"",
        "Frank: Just how big a wedding are you planning for here?",
        "Harley: Big enough, and you should be happy that you're a guy.",
        "Frank: Yes, I am happy. (Laughs) you know, you're not alone in doing this, sis. Come on. You've got dad, you've got Darci, Marina, you've got me, and...",
        "Harley: I know.",
        "Frank: You know, dad's been planning menus ever since the engagement.",
        "Harley: I know. I know. They all want to help. But...",
        "Frank: So what? Look, I know I'm a guy, but isn't planning a wedding supposed to be a very happy and exciting thing? Look at you. You look so depressed.",
        "Harley: I'm not depressed.",
        "Frank: All right, so what's the problem?",
        "Harley: I'm worried.",
        "Frank: Worried about what? The wedding?",
        "Harley: The marriage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop: Is this Brad Green's stuff?",
        "Gus: What are you doing?",
        "Cop: Chief Cooper told me to go through it.",
        "Gus: Well, it's fine. It's my case, and I'll take care of it.",
        "Cop: I'm just doing what I was told.",
        "Gus: I don't care what anybody told you. This is my case. I'll take care of it.",
        "Cop: You sure?",
        "Gus: I... can you read my lips? Thanks. Unbelievable. Please. Unbelievable. Alexandra? Yeah, I just found something else in brad green's stuff. How many times do I have to save your butt?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Are you okay, huh? How do you feel?",
        "Michelle: I feel... I don't know. I feel fine, I think.",
        "Danny: Okay. Rick will check you out. I can't believe this. I just can't... oh, god, you came back to me. You came back. I can't believe it. I just... I can't... what? What's the matter? What?",
        "Michelle: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but who are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Have you forgotten how great marriage can be?",
        "Harley: Well, if marriage is so great, why don't you and Darci go for a little walk down the aisle?",
        "Frank: We've talked about it. I'm not afraid to go back there again.",
        "Harley: Really?",
        "Frank: Yeah.",
        "Harley: Even after everything that happened with you and Eleni?",
        "Frank: What about Eleni? We had a lot of good years there, and I've got a beautiful daughter to show for it.",
        "Harley: I know. It's just... the way things ended, Frank.",
        "Frank: Yeah, they ended terribly, but I don't have any regrets.",
        "Harley: Well, I do, and I don't want to regret this. Not this time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: A little love note from you to brad green. Warms the cockles of my heart.",
        "Alexandra: (Sighs) all right. We were involved. It's not exactly a big secret.",
        "Gus: Now, you told me there was no paper trail between you and Brad Green.",
        "Alexandra: And there is none.",
        "Gus: Well, what do you call this?",
        "Alexandra: Meaningless.",
        "Gus: No. Are you aware that there's an ongoing investigation? Does that even cross your mind?",
        "Alexandra: And you told me you'd handled it.",
        "Gus: Look a little closer. No, look a little closer.",
        "Alexandra: Okay, there is nothing in here to connect me to Brad Green. Why are you so upset?",
        "Gus: You signed it \"Mrs. Godfrey.\"",
        "Alexandra: That's a name we used when we were...",
        "Gus: Please, please. That's a little too much information.",
        "Alexandra: All right, Gus. Why don't you tell me what it is that has you so upset?",
        "Gus: Godfrey. You signed it \"Godfrey.\" When Brad Green was lying on his deathbed, the last words he breathed, \"Godfrey.\" What, you didn't know that? You didn't know that? Yeah, Harley thought maybe he was praying to god or something. No, but you know what he was doing? He was pointing out his accomplice, and his accomplice was you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Haven't you learned anything? You're doing the same thing to her that you did to me and you did to Harley.",
        "Phillip: Whose side are you on?",
        "Beth: Emma's.",
        "Phillip: Doesn't sound like it to me.",
        "Beth: Oh, no. (Laughs)",
        "Phillip: What?",
        "Beth: Don't pull that with me.",
        "Phillip: Pull what?",
        "Beth: You're trying to make me feel like I did something wrong. Well, forget it, buddy. The spotlight stays on you.",
        "Phillip: I hate how well you know me sometimes.",
        "Beth: Hm. Well, it comes in handy sometimes.",
        "Phillip: Look, Olivia plays dirty. You know that firsthand.",
        "Beth: Okay. Yes. But don't take her bait. Is this the example you want to set for Emma and your other children?",
        "Phillip: I'm protecting my daughter. Yeah. I would like all my children to grow up and protect their own. Emma needs...",
        "Beth: Emma needs her mother.",
        "Phillip: She will still have her mother, on my terms.",
        "Beth: This isn't about power.",
        "Phillip: Oh, Beth, it's always about power, especially with Olivia. What else would it be about? Love?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Well, now, why would I need all that Spaulding stock?",
        "Olivia: I've suspected you for a while.",
        "Bill: Well, I don't know anything about the stock market.",
        "Olivia: Your father says you're a whiz.",
        "Bill: He said that?",
        "Olivia: Mm-hmm.",
        "Bill: Well, a beautiful lady could always get him a little flustered. I've got to talk to him about that.",
        "Olivia: Well, don't blame Billy. He was just playing proud papa. But now that the cat's out of the bag...",
        "Bill: Now, what kind of person would put a little kitty cat in a bag?",
        "Olivia: You're enjoying this way too much. It was a nice plan, though. I mean, who would ever suspect you of making a play for Spaulding?",
        "Bill: Well, you. All right, let's say I am the guy. What would I need you for?",
        "Olivia: Because alone, your stock is just stock. My stock is just stock. But together, we have a major block, and that equals power.",
        "Bill: Well, who's talking about power? Maybe I'm looking for a little investment.",
        "Olivia: You're not going to get it alone. Together we could run this town, Bill. We could build an empire.",
        "Bill: I don't know. Seems like a lot of work.",
        "Olivia: I'm offering you an opportunity of a lifetime. You'd be an idiot not to jump at it.",
        "Bill: Oh, come on, Olivia. You don't want to run an empire with me. You're living in a world of hurt. You need me to bail you out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: It's okay. It's okay, it's all right. You don't know who I am?",
        "Michelle: Should I? What's your name?",
        "Tony: Tony.",
        "Michelle: Tony.",
        "Danny: Tony's my cousin.",
        "Michelle: And who are you again?",
        "Danny: I'm Danny. I'm your husband. You don't...",
        "Michelle: No. No, I don't. I don't. I don't remember you.",
        "Danny: Find Rick. Get him in here right now.",
        "Michelle: Wait, wait, wait. Where are you going?",
        "Tony: To find a doctor. He's your brother. It's okay, all right? I'll be right back.",
        "Michelle: So why am I here? Like, am I sick or something? What's wrong with me?",
        "Tony: No. No, you were in an accident. But it's okay, Michelle. You're going to be fine.",
        "Michelle: Michelle? I'm Michelle?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: And, you know, Gus isn't Alan-Michael, he's not Phillip, and he's not even Mallet.",
        "Harley: I know. I know.",
        "Frank: All right. Well, then don't judge the guy by what all these other guys did.",
        "Harley: I'm not judging Gus. I am judging the institution of marriage.",
        "Frank: Well, you know what, sis? When it's right, it's right, and it is happily ever after.",
        "Harley: Okay, but you can have that. I think Gus and I can have that without all the paperwork, without the rings, without the pressure.",
        "Frank: You're hopeless.",
        "Harley: All right, forget about us. Let's not talk about our misery and our unhappiness. How about Blake and Ross, for example?",
        "Frank: Okay, good. How about Blake and Ross? They're back together, and they're happy.",
        "Harley: Okay, that was a bad example. It was a bad example. What about Phillip and Olivia? Now, there's a reason never to get married.",
        "Frank: Why are you going there? Why would you...",
        "Harley: Brad and Marie Green.",
        "Frank: That's even worse. You would never be like that.",
        "Harley: Never say never. Time plus love equals misery.",
        "Frank: Oh, my god, sis, you're nuts. (Laughs)",
        "Harley: Yeah, I'm nuts. Speaking of the Greens, actually...",
        "Frank: Were we?",
        "Harley: We are now. Marie Green wants me to... well, she wanted me to watch her husband.",
        "Frank: Well, that's an easy job, being that he's dead.",
        "Harley: Well, that's not the point. The point is, you know, there are loose ends that need to be tied up that really want some closure, you know, what I mean?",
        "Frank: Are you changing the subject? (Laughs)",
        "Harley: Shut up.",
        "Frank: You're still nuts, but I love you, and you are my sister.",
        "Harley: Yeah, I love you, and I'm still getting married. Just after I take care of this first.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: I am not cutting Olivia out of Emma's life, all right? I have learned a few things over the years.",
        "Beth: Good. I'm glad to hear it.",
        "Phillip: At the same time, Emma does need to have someone who is a more positive influence.",
        "Beth: She has you.",
        "Phillip: Well, I'm told that I don't always cut it.",
        "Beth: I didn't say that.",
        "Phillip: I'm talking about when I'm at work, during the day. Emma needs to have somebody who will give her the kind of love and affection, the kind of attention that you were talking about. Someone who really cares about her.",
        "Beth: Then forget about Murph. Go back to the drawing board. Find someone with those qualities.",
        "Phillip: I don't need to. I already have.",
        "Beth: Great. Who?",
        "Phillip: You.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Fine, all right. I'm desperate.",
        "Bill: I can see that.",
        "Olivia: Phillip is threatening to take my daughter away from me.",
        "Bill: And your solution is to make a power play?",
        "Olivia: It's the only thing he understands.",
        "Bill: Well, look. Why don't I just walk away, huh? Take Emma with you.",
        "Olivia: It's not that simple.",
        "Bill: Why isn't it?",
        "Olivia: The almighty Spauldings wouldn't allow it. Phillip would never allow it.",
        "Bill: Well, what's he got on you?",
        "Olivia: Doesn't matter. The point is he has control and I don't.",
        "Bill: All right, look. I don't care what's going on between you and your husband, but there is a kid involved.",
        "Olivia: A kid that he's using like a bargaining chip.",
        "Bill: Yeah? Well, maybe he's justified.",
        "Olivia: How can you say that?",
        "Bill: You told him that she was dead. I don't think I could forgive that.",
        "Olivia: I lied to protect her from his psychopathic daughter.",
        "Bill: Well, it doesn't erase the fact that you kept him from seeing his child born.",
        "Olivia: Bill, if Lizzie had gotten her way she would never have been born at all. I made a difficult decision.",
        "Bill: The wrong decision.",
        "Olivia: And what would you have done, Bill, stuck around and given Lizzie another chance to push you down the stairs?",
        "Bill: And yet you came back. Why?",
        "Olivia: For love.",
        "Bill: Of what? Money, power? Certainly not Phillip.",
        "Olivia: I love my daughter enough to sacrifice anything for her, even my own happiness.",
        "Bill: And what she needs from you right now is for you to take over Spaulding enterprises, right?",
        "Olivia: I don't expect you to understand this.",
        "Bill: All right.",
        "Olivia: I'm not asking for charity. I'm offering you a deal, a deal that you would be foolish to pass up.",
        "Bill: And yet here I am not jumping at it.",
        "Olivia: Oh, come on. You pretend you're so above this, that you're not as desperate and hungry as I am.",
        "Bill: Thanks for coming by, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: You want that power, the respect that daddy and uncle Josh will never fully hand over to you.",
        "Bill: Maybe you should go home now, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: You need me as much as I need you.",
        "Bill: Go home to your daughter. Go home to your husband.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Gus, there is nothing in here that proves that I'm Brad Greene's accomplice. I was not his accomplice.",
        "Gus: You knew what he was doing. You could have stopped him.",
        "Alexandra: No, I would have eventually. But he was a loose cannon. Beside that, it just proved far too great a risk to the family, and Alan in particular as head of the company.",
        "Gus: What, too great of a risk to continue, or too great of a risk to stop it?",
        "Alexandra: I was scared.",
        "Gus: Of what?",
        "Alexandra: Things those people said they'd do. Oh, come on. I may be a lot of things, Gus, but I am not a drug dealer.",
        "Gus: Yeah, well, the law would say differently.",
        "Alexandra: Really? Well, there must be somewhere in you that you understand this.",
        "Gus: Now, there isn't anywhere in me that would understand it.",
        "Alexandra: Really? Well, I don't believe that. Otherwise you wouldn't have protected me this far.",
        "Gus: Alexandra, when are you going to get it through your head? I did this to protect my father.",
        "Alexandra: Yes, and we do have that in common, don't we? But it's a little bit more than that, because you also would do anything for your family.",
        "Gus: We have nothing in common.",
        "Alexandra: All right. I suppose we don't.",
        "Gus: Is there anything else?",
        "Alexandra: Anything else?",
        "Gus: Anything else I need to know? Anything in that box, anything up your sleeve that connects you to Green or the drugs? Anything?",
        "Alexandra: Nothing that I know about.",
        "Gus: Well, Alexandra, that just isn't good enough for me.",
        "Alexandra: Gus, I told you that I only recently found out about Brad's operation. I most certainly never endorsed it.",
        "Gus: Well, I certainly hope you're telling the truth, Alexandra, because I am so tired of putting out your fires.",
        "Alexandra: Well, you won't have to anymore. Come on. This is one note.",
        "Gus: One note, one note, one little lie. Do you understand that I'm about to get married? You know, I'd like to spend a little time being a good detective, being a good husband.",
        "Alexandra: And you will. You have my word.",
        "Gus: I need to get back to work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Hey, you. I can't tell you how good it is to see you up and awake, Michelle.",
        "Michelle: He's my doctor?",
        "Rick: And your brother. I'm Rick.",
        "Michelle: I don't remember you. I'm sorry.",
        "Rick: No, don't apologize. It's okay. Do you mind if I ask you a couple of questions?",
        "Michelle: Sure. I don't if I'm going to know the answers, but...",
        "Rick: Do you know your name?",
        "Michelle: Yeah, but that's just because he told me. Danny told me. Danny, right?",
        "Rick: Right. Do you know the date, the year?",
        "Michelle: It's 2004. It's May.",
        "Rick: Well, no, actually it's June, but that's okay. Don't worry about that. What about your birthday?",
        "Michelle: I don't know. I have no idea. What's wrong with me? You're a doctor. Why can't I remember anything?",
        "Rick: You suffered a massive head trauma, okay, which has lead you to some long-term memory loss.",
        "Danny: Long-term memory loss?",
        "Rick: It's very common.",
        "Michelle: Well, how long is it going to last?",
        "Rick: I can't say.",
        "Danny: When will it come back?",
        "Rick: In time, the memory usually does come back, but every case is different.",
        "Danny: All right, it's okay. It'll come back. Honey, it'll come back because you're a fighter and you always have been.",
        "Michelle: I don't remember you or you.",
        "Tony: Stay with me, Michelle.",
        "Michelle: But I do remember you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coming up on \"Guiding Light\"...",
        "Beth: I don't understand.",
        "Olivia: The last little girl you tried to raise tried to kill me and my baby. So your track record isn't exactly stellar. What? I'm sorry. I... I just can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: You want me to be Emma's nanny?",
        "Phillip: No. Not her nanny. Just oversee her care.",
        "Beth: (Laughs) oh, yes. And I'm sure Olivia would just love that.",
        "Phillip: Well, I'm telling you, it's either you or sergeant Murph, there.",
        "Beth: She might prefer the sarge.",
        "Phillip: Will you at least consider it?",
        "Beth: Consider what, exactly? What are you talking about?",
        "Phillip: Hire a nanny. Somebody warm, loving, neutral. And then just, you know, be around.",
        "Beth: Oh, come on, Phillip. This isn't exactly a normal situation. The ex-wife looking out for the new wife's baby?",
        "Phillip: Beth, you're a hell of a lot more than just the ex.",
        "Beth: You're serious. You think that I'm the best choice?",
        "Phillip: You're the one that said I was getting a second chance. Help me with it.",
        "Beth: So you want me to hire the nanny and then check in every now and then?",
        "Phillip: Yeah, that's pretty much it. I mean, you're going to have to try to keep me in line anyway, right?",
        "Beth: No. I'm not going to get in the middle of the ugliness between you and Olivia.",
        "Phillip: Better you than Emma.",

        "Beth: Yes.",
        "Phillip: Good. Thank you. Oh.",
        "Beth: What?",
        "Phillip: I just realized somebody has to tell Murph.",
        "Beth: No. No. You're on your own for that.",
        "Phillip: Fair enough.",
        "Beth: Excuse me?",
        "Phillip: Yeah?",
        "Beth: I'm not finished yet.",
        "Phillip: What?",
        "Beth: I will not keep Olivia from her child or manipulate Olivia in any way. Are we clear?",
        "Phillip: Absolutely. I would never ask you to do that.",
        "Beth: Good, because I'm not going to stand by and watch that beautiful little girl suffer from the venom you and Olivia are spewing at each other. (Phone rings)",
        "Phillip: Hold that thought. Hello?",
        "Bill: Hey, Phillip, Bill Lewis.",
        "Phillip: Well, Bill, how are you?",
        "Bill: Oh, good, thanks. Look, I wanted to run a business proposal by you.",
        "Phillip: I'm listening. What sort of a business proposal?",
        "Bill: Well, it's about Spaulding. I thought you'd like to know I'm part owner now.",
        "Phillip: Is that a fact? Well, in that case, I'm available whenever you are.",
        "Olivia: Phillip?",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm?",
        "Olivia: Who's the burly woman in the living room?",
        "Phillip: Where?",
        "Beth: Oh, she didn't introduce herself?",
        "Olivia: She said her name was Murph, and she practically broke my hand. Who is she?",
        "Phillip: She's a candidate for Emma's nanny.",
        "Olivia: Emma has a nanny-- Janice.",
        "Phillip: Well, not any longer. I let her go.",
        "Olivia: You what?",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm. I know you've been concerned about Emma's care and safety.",
        "Olivia: That woman is not taking care of my baby. I'm calling Janice.",
        "Phillip: No, Janice is not acceptable, but I found someone whose objective.",
        "Olivia: Wait, wait, wait. I'm not finished discussing this. Where are you going?",
        "Phillip: I have a meeting. Beth will explain everything.",
        "Olivia: Phillip...",
        "Beth: Phillip!",

        "Gus: Excuse me. What is it you think you're doing?",
        "Harley: I was just taking my client's... Alexandra, what are you doing here?",
        "Gus: She was here to discuss the wedding and all the plans.",
        "Harley: Our wedding?",
        "Gus: Yeah, but I...",
        "Alexandra: We have to get together, Harley.",
        "Gus: And you should do that, but I know you're just leaving, so...",
        "Alexandra: All right, yes. Well, I'll call you.",
        "Gus: And I'll walk you out. It'll be my pleasure to do that.",
        "Alexandra: What are you going to do, Gus?",
        "Gus: It's really nice of you to stop by to see me. Take it easy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Alex, good. Just the person I needed to talk to. You got a minute?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, for you, chief, anything, sure.",
        "Gus: I didn't think you wanted to talk about weddings or plans or anything, you know?",
        "Harley: Well, you thought right, Gushopper.",
        "Gus: Gushopper. I like that one.",
        "Harley: But you didn't have to usher Alexandra away. We called a truce.",
        "Gus: A truce? Who, you did? When?",
        "Harley: Yeah, yesterday. She and I used to be sort of friendly, you know.",
        "Gus: Yeah?",
        "Harley: Before. And before everything with you and Alan.",
        "Gus: Well, that's a lot of everything.",
        "Harley: It sure is. But I didn't come here to talk about Alexandra.",
        "Gus: No?",
        "Harley: Smooth move with the box, honey. Are those Brad Green's things?",
        "Gus: Yeah. Well, yeah, we got them out of his office. We collected everything.",
        "Harley: Well, good, because his wife sent me... his wife, my client, she sent me down to get them. So hand them over.",
        "Gus: No, honey, you can't touch that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: This is good. Okay, so what do you remember about Tony?",
        "Michelle: He... you lifted me up.",
        "Tony: Yeah, and you kind of opened your eyes. You said my name.",
        "Rick: You found her? Is this before the second explosion?",
        "Tony: Yeah.",
        "Michelle: What? Explosion? What?",
        "Danny: The accident that you were in. There was an explosion in a warehouse and you were trapped inside.",
        "Michelle: And you saved me?",
        "Tony: I pulled you out.",
        "Rick: Tony is the one who brought you here, Michelle. He's the reason that you're still in our lives.",
        "Tony: No, I just... I happened to be at the right place at the right time, Michelle. It was Danny's faith. Seriously, it was his faith that brought you back to us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Would you help me out here? I am trying to close an investigation.",
        "Gus: Why? For what? What do you need to find out, huh? You want to find out who the guy was sleeping with before he died? You doing that for his wife?",
        "Harley: Yes, I am doing that for his wife, my client. You know, she needs a little closure. Maybe something in that box could provide it for her.",
        "Gus: Oh, please. Just tell her the guy was a dirty dog. That's the way it is, right? What difference does it make? What does it matter?",
        "Harley: It matters.",
        "Gus: How does it matter? How? Does it matter if this hurts my reputation or gets me in trouble?",
        "Harley: In trouble with whom?",
        "Gus: Does that matter?",
        "Harley: Who is going to care if you look at...?",
        "Gus: Because people are listening to us. This person... how about your brother? He's the chief of police, right there. He's listening.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: I just wanted you to know that my guys have been assigned cleanup duty into the Spaulding investigation.",
        "Alexandra: Cleanup? Well, I wouldn't think there'd be much cleanup. After all, the feds got their man.",
        "Frank: Well, that's the way it looks, but anyway I just wanted to thank you and your family for your full cooperation.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, please, Frank. Why wouldn't we? We have nothing to hide.",
        "Frank: I know, but, Alex, well, you know how it is.",
        "Alexandra: (Laughs) how is it?",
        "Frank: Well, a top Spaulding executive arrested for dealing drugs, I mean, that could be very embarrassing to a company.",
        "Alexandra: Well, okay, I'll admit that our P.R. department's been working overtime.",
        "Frank: I'm sure. You know, I wouldn't have been surprised if you'd tried to keep us out.",
        "Alexandra: Well, thank you. Thank you for the vote of confidence, Frank, really.",
        "Frank: I didn't mean that in a negative way. I'm just saying that you people did a very good job.",
        "Alexandra: Okay. Well, I'm glad we could make your job easier.",
        "Frank: You have.",
        "Alexandra: Well, maybe it's all due to your future brother- in-law over there. Maybe he's been a good influence on us, huh? (Chuckles) you have a good day, Frank.",
        "Frank: You do the same. Hope to see you soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Olivia, Phillip isn't trying to keep you from Emma. I wouldn't let him.",
        "Olivia: Why are you taking on my daughter's care?",
        "Beth: Emma shouldn't have to suffer because of her parents' idiotic feud.",
        "Olivia: She's not suffering, Beth.",
        "Beth: But she will if you don't do something. Children sense these things.",
        "Olivia: Is that what happened with Lizzie?",
        "Beth: I don't understand.",
        "Olivia: The last little girl you tried to raise tried to kill me and my baby, so your track record isn't exactly stellar.",
        "Beth: You're right. I think maybe that's something you should discuss with Phillip.",
        "Olivia: No need. Believe it or not, I actually think this could be a good thing.",
        "Beth: A good thing?",
        "Olivia: Yeah. Despite my reservations, I know you're not out to hurt me or Emma.",
        "Beth: No, I'm not. And this is only temporary, until you and Phillip can work things out.",
        "Olivia: Of course. And I assume that you've learned from your mistakes. You'll be extra vigilant with Emma.",
        "Beth: Believe me, I've learned plenty.",
        "Olivia: Good. Then you know your number one job is to protect Emma from her father.",

        "Bill: Ah, Phillip, come on in. Have a seat.",
        "Phillip: Doing some renovations?",
        "Bill: Yeah, a little bit. I needed a little change, that's all. You're probably wondering why I called you over here.",
        "Phillip: Well, actually, I'm surprised you're even thinking about business this soon after what happened to Eden.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, work takes my mind off it, you know?",
        "Phillip: I do.",
        "Bill: It's also helped me realize that life's too short not to go after what you want.",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm. And what exactly is it that you want from me?",
        "Bill: Well, when Alan and Gus stepped in for you, I went to them with a proposal.",
        "Phillip: You did?",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Phillip: Oh. I wasn't aware of that.",
        "Bill: Well, old grudges die hard, but you and I, we're the next generation.",
        "Phillip: Well, maybe you are. I think I had already been around the block a few times before you were born.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, I'm not a kid anymore.",
        "Phillip: I assumed that much when you were dating Beth.",
        "Bill: Okay, Phillip, I think we can form a very profitable partnership.",
        "Phillip: You do?",
        "Bill: Mm-hmm. Spaulding Real Estate Development and Lewis Construction.",
        "Phillip: Oh. I have to say I'm relieved.",
        "Bill: Why is that?",
        "Phillip: Oh, I don't know. I thought perhaps you were going to try to kiss me the way you kissed my wife.",

        "Rick: All right. I'm going to run a few more tests. I'll be right back.",
        "Danny: Do you think you'll find something?",
        "Rick: Danny, I'm just going to try to play it safe here, okay? Michelle, listen. If you need anything, just push the call button and ask the nurse to come track me down, okay? Everything's going to be fine. I'll be right back.",
        "Michelle: Thanks.",
        "Tony: Listen, Danny, I'm going to give you some time, okay?",
        "Danny: Can I get you something? Do you want anything?",
        "Michelle: Some water.",
        "Danny: I can't imagine what you must be going through right now. Here you go.",
        "Michelle: We were married?",
        "Danny: Are. We are married.",
        "Michelle: Were we in love?",
        "Danny: More than I can tell you.",
        "Michelle: So our marriage was good?",
        "Danny: Mm-hmm. Our lives were complicated, but yeah, you and I were good, and we've always been good.",
        "Michelle: Good. That's good. That's good.",
        "Danny: I guess this is... this must be kind of scary for you, not remembering.",
        "Michelle: It's a little freaky.",
        "Danny: It's okay. I know that I'M... right now, I guess I'm a little bit of a stranger to you, so maybe you can't really believe anything I'm telling you. But can you look in my eyes and see how I feel about you?",
        "Michelle: I don't really know what I'm seeing.",
        "Danny: Okay. It's okay. It's all right. We're going to get through this together.",
        "Michelle: Thank you.",
        "Danny: This is a little awkward.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, it's a little.",
        "Danny: God, there is so much I want to tell you.",
        "Michelle: Well, we've got time, right?",
        "Danny: Yeah. I just... Michelle, I want you to know that, however long it takes, I'm not going anywhere, okay? I'm going to be right here, right here. What?",
        "Michelle: I'm sorry. I... I just can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: So, you saw me kiss Olivia, huh? That figures.",
        "Phillip: Did you find her enjoyable?",
        "Bill: Look, Phillip, I was drinking. It didn't mean a thing, okay?",
        "Phillip: No, it's really all right. It's perfectly all right. I would only be concerned if your intention were to try to play Olivia and me off against each other.",
        "Bill: Well, now, why would you think that?",
        "Phillip: Well, I don't know, Bill. Sometimes a kiss is more than just a kiss.",
        "Bill: Look, I'm just trying to strike the best deal, Phillip.",
        "Phillip: Aren't we all?",
        "Bill: Great. So, then, are you in? Because I'm ready to get this thing moving.",
        "Phillip: I'll be in touch, all right? In the meantime, a piece of advice: Don't bother hedging your bets. There will only be one winner, and it will not be Olivia.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Olivia, don't try to get me to take sides, because I won't.",
        "Olivia: Is that what I was trying to do?",
        "Beth: Olivia, I understand how difficult this is for you. I only want what's best for Emma.",
        "Olivia: We both do. Remind me to show you, there is a trick to feeding her her bottle, and there's a way that I rock her. It always makes her go to sleep.",
        "Beth: Good. I want to know it.",
        "Olivia: Believe it or not, I'm a good mother.",
        "Beth: I believe it.",
        "Olivia: Can I trust you to make sure that Phillip won't run away with Emma?",
        "Beth: That won't happen. But the same goes for you. Emma stays right here.",
        "Olivia: Fair enough. I'm actually relieved.",
        "Beth: You are? Why?",
        "Olivia: Because as long as my daughter is being cared for and I don't have to worry about Phillip, I'm free to secure Emma's future.",

        "Harley: What about fianc\u00e9s? Don't they get any privileges?",
        "Gus: No, that would even look worse. That's not...",
        "Harley: You are spending too much time with my brother.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: Well, throw me a bone. I mean, if you see something in there that you think could help me, would you tell me, please?",
        "Gus: I wouldn't even... well, that I would do, yeah.",
        "Harley: Gee, thanks.",
        "Gus: Mm-hmm. Not a problem.",
        "Harley: You sure have changed. You know, when we were partners, I was the one reminding you not to break the rules.",
        "Gus: (Laughs)",
        "Harley: All right.",
        "Gus: All right.",
        "Harley: I'll see you later.",

        "Danny: It's okay. Michelle, really, it's okay. I understand. It's okay. I'm going to go talk to Rick. If you need anything, I'll be right outside, okay?",
        "Michelle: All right.",
        "Danny: Okay. All right, you just take it easy.",
        "Michelle: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: I know this is frustrating, Danny. It's frustrating to me. We just... you've got to give it time. You have to give it time.",
        "Danny: Tony, will you go sit with her, please? Thank you. How long could this last?",
        "Rick: It's like I said, Danny, I don't know.",
        "Danny: All right. What can I do to help her get her memory back?",
        "Rick: You slow down. You slow down right now. You show her pictures, you tell her about herself, and who knows? Maybe she will come back. Maybe she will remember.",
        "Danny: What do you mean, maybe? You sound like she might never remember again.",
        "Rick: It's a possibility, Danny, that it may never...",
        "Danny: No, it's not, Rick. That's not going to happen. I won't let it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: So, you make a habit of rescuing amnesiacs from exploding warehouses?",
        "Tony: No. You happen to be the first. Listen, Michelle, this is going to sound a little funny, but what's it like not having any memories?",
        "Michelle: It's weird, though I really don't have anything to compare it to.",
        "Tony: I guess not. You want me to leave so you can, you've got to be somewhat tired, right?",
        "Michelle: I think I got plenty of sleep lately, don't you think?",
        "Tony: A little, yeah.",
        "Michelle: Actually, if you don't mind, I'd really like you to stay.",

        "Michelle: Why don't I feel anything for you?",
        "Tammy: No one wants to lose, especially not me.",
        "Olivia: It makes me a desperate woman. You wouldn't like me when I'm desperate. You've never seen anyone so dangerous before."
