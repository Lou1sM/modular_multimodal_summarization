        "Ava: \"Coop, this place has been more than a great place to work. It's been my home. You've treated me like part of the family. That meant everything to me. I'm so sorry to leave you like this, but I think you understand why. I'll miss you, more than you'll ever imagine. Good luck with Lizzie... and the baby.\"",

        "Buzz: You're still here?",
        "Coop: Pops, what the hell do you do when you're feeling 500 different emotions all at the same time?",
        "Buzz: 500 emotions?",
        "Coop: Yes, 500 of them. Fury at Lizzie for lying to me, grief because I just lost a child, but also relief because I'm not married to Lizzie. I mean, do you want me to go on? The list is huge.",
        "Buzz: I think I'd pick the positive emotion.",
        "Coop: ( Laughs ) Dad, the positive? What possible emotion could that be?",
        "Buzz: Hope.",

        "Frank: Don't move!",
        "Ava: What are you doing? Oh, my God. Who did you think was in here?",
        "Frank: Somebody who would turn on the lights to let me know that they were here?",
        "Ava: I'm sorry.",
        "Frank: No, I'm sorry for scaring you, but...",
        "Ava: Jeez.",
        "Frank: What's going on here?",
        "Ava: I'll give you three guesses. I'm taking off.",
        "Frank: You're leaving Springfield?",
        "Ava: That's the plan.",
        "Frank: Look, uh, Ava... hey, I know you've had a rough day, but you'll get through it.",
        "Ava: I have had a rough day. And I'm worried about the day after that, and the day after that, and the day after that. You know? I mean, you know how Coop is. He believes in doing the right thing, and there's nothing I can do about that. I saw him at the altar with Lizzie today. And I saw how he was looking at her. And it made me realize he would never break those vows, and I would never ask him to do that.",
        "Frank: I had to leave the wedding. I had no idea that you were there. Why would you ever do that to yourself?",
        "Ava: Well, believe it or not, I was thinking about stopping it-- at least, I was going to try to.",
        "Frank: And what changed your mind?",
        "Ava: The look on his face. He was so serious, and he reminded me of, like, a character from a romantic novel or a book or something, a movie. He's just so good and so nice, and he has a really, really big heart, too. Lizzie doesn't deserve him, but his child does. And I'm not going to be the one to stand in between that, Frank.",
        "Frank: Ava, I am so sorry.",
        "Ava: Do you know how hard it's going to be for me to go on without him? I mean, I never thought this could happen to someone like me. But Coop is one of those people that you just never get over.",

        "Ava: ( Laughs )",
        "Frank: Ava, I've got to be honest with you, you don't seem like the cut and run type to me.",
        "Ava: Frank, I mean, you and your family, you're really all I have here in Springfield. And I love you guys. But if I stay here, I'm going to spend the rest of my life watching Coop move on with Lizzie? You know, the reality is, is that ever since I came to town, I've been causing trouble. That's it.",
        "Frank: No, that's not true.",

        "Coop: No! Ava. You and Lizzie may have just ruined the best thing that's ever happened in my life.",
        "Beth: But she loves you, Coop. Lizzie, she loves you beyond reason. She just doesn't know what to do with all of that love.",
        "Coop: I can tell her exactly what she can do with that love.",
        "Beth: So that's it? You're just going to walk away from her and the baby. You're going to make her fend off Jonathan Randall all on her own.",
        "Coop: Beth, I did everything I was supposed to do. I almost went through with that lie of a wedding. But you know what? It's over. So why don't you people do me a favor and go on with the rest of your lives, and let me live mine-- at least what I have left of it.",

        "Ava: Are you accusing me of something?",
        "Olivia: No, see you around.",
        "Ava: I didn't ask for his sympathy. He gave it to me, he was just being nice to me. You know you're really lucky, you're really lucky that you have such a nice guy. I'm not like you, looking for money and men, all I want is",
        "Olivia: All you want is love, right Ava. You know we are not that different, I've just lived a little longer than you have. I've seen what vulnerability can do to a woman, you see things you never saw before, you do things that you thought you would never do, just makes you needy.",
        "Ava: I'll remember to avoid that. You are such a hypocrite",
        "Olivia: Excuse me?",
        "Ava: It never stopped you from hitting on anybody you wanted to, right? How about leading Buzz around while you're dating Frank? Josh Lewis? How about Bill?",

        "Coop: Look, where is she, Frank?",
        "Frank: Okay, Jim, could you hold on one second here? You see, this is a cell phone. When it's pressed against my ear, that means that I'm talking, so...",
        "Coop: I'm sorry.",

        "Coop: You saw her. When?",
        "Frank: A little while ago. She was leaving you a note.",
        "Coop: A note? Uh...",

        "Coop: My wi... Frank, is that supposed to be funny?",
        "Frank: Uh, no, I don't think so, because the last time I saw you, you were about the take the plunge, and, um... I got called out on a case, so...",
        "Coop: So you don't know, then, right. Okay.",

        "Coop: Yeah, Frank, I didn't do it.",
        "Frank: You didn't do what?",
        "Coop: I didn't take the plunge, all right? I didn't jump off the broom, I didn't break the glass. I mean... don't you get it? I didn't get married, all right? I left Lizzie at the altar.",
        "Frank: What?! What happened?",
        "Coop: Yes. Look, Lizzie lied to me. The baby? It's not mine.",

        "Frank: My God. I hope I'm retired by the time that baby grows up.",
        "Coop: Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, hold on. Wait, whoa, whoa. Can we deal with that whole shock and awe of that later? Right now, I need to know where Ava is. Um... note. You said that there was a note. Where is it?",
        "Frank: She left it right by the bar.",
        "Coop: Oh, no.",
        "Frank: What?",
        "Coop: She's leaving. She's... she's leaving, Frank. Damn it! No, wait, you said you just talked to her, right? You saw her before. That means she couldn't have gotten far.",
        "Frank: She's probably at the Beacon packing her suitcase.",
        "Coop: The Beacon. She's at the Beacon. Great. I've got to burn that luggage. ( Knocks on door ) Ava. Ava, it's me, Coop. Please, look, I know that you're hurt, and that I'm probably the last person that you want to see or even talk to right now, but, please, if you could just open up the door. Come on, Coop, you're such a jerk. She doesn't even know why you're here. Ava, please, look, open the door. I didn't do it. I didn't go through with it. Look, I didn't marry Lizzie. Ava, if you would just open the door, I would...",
        "Olivia: Coop!",
        "Coop: Olivia.",
        "Olivia: Aren't you supposed to be...",
        "Coop: No, the wedding didn't happen, all right? Where is she?",
        "Olivia: Wait, wait, back up. The last I left you, you were getting ready to be Mr. Lizzie Spaulding.",
        "Coop: Right, I know, that's very funny. No, she lied to me, all right? Lizzie lied to me again, as usual. So I need to know, where is she?",
        "Olivia: I'm sorry, Coop, she's gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: The worst day of my life. Also happens to be the longest day of the year. It wasn't supposed to be like this. I guess I was lucky to find Coop at all. And I thought finding him would make all the difference in the world. And it did, you know, for a little while.",
        "Ava: So why don't we pick up where we left off?",
        "Coop: Mm, okay. Let me see, let me see. Boxing Day.",

        "Ava: Mm-hmm.",
        "Coop: In fact, I'm kind of wishing that I was over there, back in England right now, to celebrate it this year.",
        "Ava: Well, maybe we can go next year together. How's that?",
        "Coop: Mm-hmm. Whoa. Together as in together together?",
        "Ava: Yeah!",
        "Coop: Not one of these, you know, \"Hi, we happened to run into you, how are you doing, it's good to see you, we just happened to be here by coincidence on Boxing Day together\"?",
        "Ava: No. How about this? How about next year, on Boxing Day, we wake up in each other's arms.",

        "Ava: What the hell is Boxing Day?",
        "Coop: Boxing Day, all right. Whoa. Hey, easy there, slugger. All right, all right. Boxing Day, Boxing Day, Boxing Day. You know what? I'll explain it later. What I do want to know is, what is your favorite obscure holiday?",
        "Ava: That's so easy. Groundhog Day.",
        "Coop: Groundhog Day?",
        "Ava: Of course!",
        "Coop: Ava, that's hardly a holiday.",
        "Ava: I think we should do more to celebrate Groundhog Day-- you know, out of respect for the groundhogs. How about Groundhog Day baskets? Little baby chocolate groundhogs? Little chocolate ears?",
        "Coop: Okay.",
        "Ava: Groundhog carols!",
        "Coop: All right, you know what, I'm following you here. I see where you're going. The whole winter into spring thing. I got you.",
        "Ava: It's about hope, actually.",
        "Coop: Well, my other favorite holiday would be the summer solstice, June 21. I don't know. Just something about it. I enjoy the longest day.",
        "Ava: The longest day of the year?",
        "Coop: Yeah. What?",
        "Ava: What?",
        "Coop: What?",
        "Ava: The longest day of the year? I love the longest day of the year! It's like my favorite day. Honestly, remember I told you that my mom and I cleaned house for the Foster's, back in the day.",
        "Coop: Yeah.",
        "Ava: Okay. So, my mom never had any time off. But the one day of the year she did was the longest day of the year, summer solstice. And that was the only day that she let us go out. We could do whatever we wanted, as long as we were outside, playing from sunrise to sunset. Summer solstice.",
        "Coop: So what were these things? What would you go out and do?",
        "Ava: We would just hang out together, you know? Spend time together. Have fun. Nothing in particular.",
        "Coop: Hmm. Tell you what. I have an idea. Come here. Watch out!",
        "Ava: Whoa!",
        "Coop: Come here. You know what? That's what we'll do this year.",

        "Coop: Did she say anything about where she was going?",
        "Olivia: No, not particularly.",
        "Coop: Come on, Olivia, think, please.",
        "Olivia: Whoa, whoa, whoa. This isn't my fault.",
        "Coop: I'm sorry. All right, look, I'm just a little desperate right now to find out where she might be going, what she might have said. Perhaps she said something about where she might be going, but it might not have been important at the time when she said it.",
        "Olivia: I saw her. I drove her here to the Beacon. We spoke. She left. Will you just take a deep breath? It's been a long day.",
        "Coop: Long day. That's it! The longest day! It's the summer solstice. Today, it's the longest day. That's it! Olivia, come here. You are a genius. Thank you so much.",

        "Ava: Nah. I think the world would be a pretty sad place if everything was already decided, right?",
        "Colin: Especially when the guy you love runs off and marries someone else.",

        "Coop: Well, do you?",
        "Jonathan: Henry. That's none of your business.",
        "Coop: So what are you going to do, you going to step up now?",
        "Jonathan: Don't worry about it.",
        "Coop: Up until a few hours ago, I was the little girl's father.",
        "Jonathan: Good for you, Henry. The best thing I can do for that kid is walk away. You can thank me later, after you and Ava come up for air.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colin: Hey, it stopped ringing.",
        "Ava: Oh, good. Thank you. It's time for me to go.",
        "Colin: Oh. Okay. Can I drop you off somewhere on the way?",
        "Ava: Sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Hey. No luck finding love?",
        "Coop: Well, she's either gone, or she just doesn't want to be found. So now... Frank, it's up to you.",
        "Frank: To me?",
        "Coop: Yeah. You're my brother.",
        "Frank: Uh, yes I am.",
        "Coop: And you're also the Chief of Police, all right? You can do something here.",
        "Frank: Look, Coop...",
        "Coop: No, Frank, please. You can put out an APB. You can do something for me.",
        "Frank: Look, brother, officially I can't do that. You know that.",
        "Buzz: Frank, come on! Come on, look at him.",
        "Coop: She thinks I'm married to Lizzie. Okay? But I mean, don't you get it? I almost was so close to having a life that I never wanted. And all of a sudden, I have the opportunity to have the life that I've always wanted, with the first girl that's ever...",
        "Buzz: Frank. Come on, look at him. He loves her. Come on.",
        "Olivia: But you know, she doesn't want to be found.",
        "Coop: Because she doesn't know, that's why! Look, I mean, don't you guys see? This, means everything to me. She, Ava, means everything to me. All right? I lost a child today. Okay? I was slapped in the face at my own wedding. But I walked away with hope. I mean, Frank, you've got to have felt something like that along the way, something so special for someone, feel that much about them.",
        "Buzz: Of course he has. Frank, come on!",
        "Coop: Please, come on.",
        "Buzz: Damn it, come on.",
        "Frank: This is Chief Cooper. I need you to put a 20 on Ava Peralta. I want you to spread it around to all the patrol cars out there. It's for a very good reason. ( Laughs ) True love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: There's no one for you but me. Without you, there is no me.",
        "Ava: And without you, there is no me.",
        "Beth: Well, well, well. Hello, Ava. I assume that bag inside is yours. Going somewhere?",
        "Ava: Surprised to see me thawed out, Beth?",
        "Beth: Oh, please. Don't be so dramatic. I wasn't trying to hurt you.",
        "Ava: Oh, no. No, no, no, no. Locking someone in a meat locker until they almost run out of air, that's not what you were trying to do at all, right?",
        "Beth: You had plenty of air, obviously. So, what are you doing here? Come to see Coop?",
        "Ava: I know that Coop and Lizzie, they're long gone, enjoying their honeymoon. I just came here because I just wanted to see everything for myself. You know, take it all in before I go.",
        "Beth: Yes. Go.",
        "Ava: I'm leaving. You can tell Lizzie. I'm sure she'll be happy about that.",
        "Beth: You know, Ava, you might find this hard to believe, but I know what it's like to be in your place. I know the kind of pain you're in, loving someone and not being able to be with them. It's a good idea, getting away from it all. Where are you going?",
        "Ava: I haven't decided yet.",
        "Beth: Well, don't hang around here. Seeing Lizzie and Coop every day will just torture you. And then, when the baby comes...",
        "Ava: I know, okay?",
        "Beth: So, go, go, as fast and as far away from Springfield as you can. You don't want to end up hard and bitter like me.",
        "Ava: England. I was thinking about going to England. That was the one thing that Coop and I had that Lizzie wasn't involved in. I could go there and live out the dream that Coop and I never had a chance to have.",
        "Beth: My driver could take you to the airport.",
        "Ava: ( Laughs ) Thanks. You've done enough for me already, Beth.",
        "Beth: No, no. You know, I really... I want to do this for you. The sooner you get away from Springfield, the happier you'll be. I'm sorry. Okay. I'll get your bags.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Okay, thank you for checking. She checked out of the Beacon, okay? If she's driving around out there, we need a license plate number.",
        "Coop: Uh, licen... oh, jeez, I don't even know. I think there's a \"J\" in it or something.",
        "Frank: A \"J.\"",
        "Coop: A \"J,\" yes.",
        "Buzz: Well, why don't we narrow this down, guys? I mean, where does she go when she's upset? Where does she hang out?",
        "Coop: Pops, here. She hangs out here when she's upset, when she does anything.",
        "Marina: What's going on?",
        "Frank: Well, we're looking for Ava, for Coop.",
        "Marina: Well, she called me on my cell phone.",
        "Coop: When?",
        "Marina: She was at the airport. She said that she was leaving for England.",
        "Coop: England?",
        "Olivia: Maybe you should let her go. She's had a lot of drama for one day.",
        "Coop: No. Letting her go is not an option here. Look, maybe her flight hasn't left, right?",
        "Frank: You have a siren on top of your car?",
        "Coop: Frank, no, I don't have a...",
        "Frank: I do.",
        "Coop: All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Attendant: You just made it. The plane is boarding now.",
        "Ava: Thank you.",
        "Attendant: Have a nice flight.",
        "Ava: Okay, Coop. This is where you rush in, and you stop me just before I board the flight out of your life forever. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Excuse me! Wait! Look, I've got a ticket. Please. I need to get on that flight to England.",
        "Attendant: That flight has already left. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Coop: Ava!",
        "Lizzie: No, it's me.",
        "Coop: Lizzie. What do you want?",
        "Lizzie: Okay, look, I know that you probably don't want to talk to me right now. Probably never, actually.",
        "Coop: Look, what do you want?",
        "Lizzie: I can't find my prenatal vitamins. You... you always stayed on top of that stuff, and I'm kind of lost without you.",
        "Coop: Look, just, I think they're in the fridge, okay?",
        "Lizzie: Coop, what if I begged? What if I begged you not to leave me? Would you... would you at least listen, because... um, that's what I'm going to do. Please don't make me have this baby alone.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, you can't...",
        "Lizzie: Look, I know what I did was wrong, okay? I mean, it was way, way, way wrong, past wrong. It was crazy. But you know what, we've all been doing kind of crazy stuff, and maybe we could try to make sense of it all, and maybe we could try to grow up.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, I can't promise that. In fact, I can't promise anything, all right? Just please, go take your vitamins, okay?",
        "Lizzie: I just checked in the fridge. They're not there.",
        "Coop: Look, I don't know! I don't know.",
        "Lizzie: Coop, are you there?",
        "Coop: Yeah, I am.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, I also left some stuff in the nursery at the boardinghouse. I was wondering maybe when I could come by to get them.",
        "Coop: No. I'll have them sent over. Excuse me, what's going on?",
        "Guard: Sir, step away from the gate.",
        "Coop: What is going on?",
        "Guard: Step away from.",
        "Lizzie: Coop, are you there?",
        "Coop: Lizzie, look, gotta go.",
        "Lizzie: Coop, no!",
        "Ava: Stop it! Get your hands off of me! What are you doing? I already went through security!",
        "Coop: Ava!",
        "Ava: Stop! Coop! What are you doing here?",
        "Coop: I'm trying to find you!",
        "Ava: I thought you were supposed to be on your honeymoon!",
        "Coop: No. No, no, no. I didn't go through with it. I didn't marry Lizzie.",
        "Ava: What?!",
        "Coop: Yes! Look, she lied to me.",
        "Ava: No.",
        "Coop: Lizzie lied to me. The baby is not even mine. It's Jonathan's.",
        "Ava: Jon... no!",
        "Coop: Yes!",
        "Ava: Oh, my God! Okay, the last time I saw you, you were doing your vows and everything.",
        "Coop: I know, I know, I know. You left. You took off too early. Jonathan burst in. The wedding never happened.",
        "Ava: You're not married?!",
        "Coop: No. I'm not anything except here with you!",
        "Ava: You're not married! Oh! ( Laughs )",
        "Frank: Okay. Good job, fellas. I'll take it from here. You can release them to me. I'll take them straight to the station, so...",
        "Coop: Frank, I owe you so big.",
        "Frank: Coop.",
        "Coop: I owe you, big brother.",
        "Frank: It's all right, man. That's what brothers are for. Don't worry. I'll collect some day. (Laughs)",
        "Coop: Thank you so much.",
        "Ava: Thank you. Thank you.",
        "Frank: Ava, you're welcome. All right, now, let's get out of here, because I'm double-parked. Come on.",
        "Coop: Come here.",
        "Ava: Oh, my gosh.",
        "Coop: I never gave up. I never gave up hope at all. Look, I'm here with you.",
        "Ava: I...",
        "Coop: I didn't want to let you get away.",
        "Ava: I kind of gave up hope, because I didn't dream it could happen.",
        "Coop: No. No, no, look, we're here together. We're here together right now.",
        "Ava: ( Laughs ) You better not leave me, okay? This is it, for real, right?",
        "Coop: This is us, you and me.",
        "Ava: Okay, good.",
        "Coop: This is the beginning of u the two of us, here, together, always.",
        "Ava: I'm going to make sure that you don't get away from me.",
        "Coop: What?",
        "Ava: You're not getting away from me again.",

        "Lizzie: He's emptying out the nursery? Why? Oh, to make room for Ava.",
        "Marina: I'm so totally over the guy. But he is crazy about me. And I think that I can use that to get us the information that we need about Harley.",
