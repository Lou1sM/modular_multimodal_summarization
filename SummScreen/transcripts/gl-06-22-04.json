        "Olivia: Don't burst a blood vessel. That one on your neck looks like it's about to blow any second.",
        "Bill: What tells me this is not a coincidence?",
        "Olivia: You know what I don't get? If it hurts so much, why did we do it?",
        "Bill: Well, I think you understand just fine... Mrs. Spaulding.",
        "Olivia: I came to you with my heart on my sleeve. I gave you a chance to parlay Spaulding stock into an empire. What do you do, you go to Phillip.",
        "Bill: Did I?",
        "Olivia: Yes.",
        "Bill: I thought the Spauldings were known for their discretion.",
        "Olivia: Playing me against Phillip? Is this really how you want to do this?",
        "Bill: It's just business, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: No, it isn't just business. It's personal for me. Phillip could take my daughter away from me. That makes me a desperate woman. You wouldn't like me when I'm desperate.",
        "Bill: And how do you know that?",
        "Olivia: Because you've never seen anyone so dangerous before.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Thank so much for coming over here before your internship meeting.",
        "Joey: Yeah, how could I say no to a limo outside of my house? The neighbors were going crazy.",
        "Lizzie: (Laughs)",
        "Joey: Plus, mom. I wish you were there to see that.",
        "Lizzie: I just... I wanted to get you alone for a second. And I really am sorry about what happened with Tammy.",
        "Joey: Yeah. Don't you get tired of always apologizing to everyone?",
        "Lizzie: And I'm really thought you knew about Tammy kissing Edmund. I don't want all this drama to interfere with you getting the Spaulding internship, you know.",
        "Joey: Yeah, well, thanks for thinking of me. I appreciate it. No, I really do.",
        "Lizzie: Can I tell you something without you freaking out? I care about you. I mean, as a friend. Not that other way.",
        "Josh: Yeah. (Laughs) that other way. I heard about that.",
        "Lizzie: No, I'm serious.",
        "Joey: Look, Lizzie, we're cool, okay.",
        "Lizzie: Really? Can I have a hug?",
        "Joey: You didn't get enough the first time?",
        "Lizzie: No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Tammy. Hi, sweetie pie.",
        "Josh: Hello, Tammy.",
        "Reva: What are you doing here? I thought there was a big internship meeting at Spaulding today.",
        "Tammy: I'm dropping out.",
        "Josh: What are you talking about? I thought the contest just started.",
        "Tammy: Thing. The competition and the people. Alan and his million dollar suits. I could think of better ways to spend the summer.",
        "Reva: This is about Joey, isn't it? I heard you two split up.",
        "Tammy: Did I say anything about Joey?",
        "Josh: Look, darling, we know that Joey hurt you and you probably never want to see his face again. I understand that. But in spite of the way I feel about the Spauldings, this is an excellent opportunity for you.",
        "Reva: And I know you probably don't want any advice.",
        "Tammy: Like that's going to stop you.",
        "Rick: Okay, here's the deal. You get tough. Because no niece of mine is going to let some guy ruin her chances of living her life. So the fact is you have two options. The first one is, you get in there and you fight for Joey. The second one is, you punish him for leaving.",
        "Josh: She's actually done both with me. And the first one is more desirable.",
        "Reva: No. Now there are some good points about option b though.",
        "Tammy: I am liking the punishment angle.",
        "Reva: Well, good. Good choice. So this is what you do. You go home and put on something that Joey could never even imagine seeing you in and then you strut into Spaulding Enterprises and you ignore him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Hey. Wow, look at you. You're up.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, well, don't get all excited because I still don't remember everything.",
        "Danny: Oh, that's okay.",
        "Michelle: I'm not lying in this bed any longer, you know. I don't care if I ever sleep again.",
        "Danny: Okay.",
        "Michelle: So what do you got?",
        "Danny: Well, I brought a couple of things of yours from our house. They might trigger your memory.",
        "Michelle: Okay.",
        "Tony: I'm going to take off, okay.",
        "Michelle: You're leaving?",
        "Tony: Yeah. You guys need some time alone. So I'm going to go.",
        "Danny: Well, hold on. Hold on.",
        "Michelle: You know what, Tony? I don't know. You're like the only thing I do remember. So I'd really like if you stay.",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Tony: You don't need me here, Michelle. I mean, you and Danny have a lot of things to remember.",
        "Danny: Tony. Come on, stay. Sit down. You could help.",
        "Tony: Are you sure?",
        "Danny: Yeah. Please.",
        "Tony: All right.",
        "Michelle: All right. So let's see who I was.",
        "Danny: Yeah, I was thinking maybe you could, you know, take one thing out at a time, and I can explain.",
        "Michelle: All right. So we've got a rock and a seashell.",
        "Danny: I was thinking I could explain...",
        "Nurse on intercom: Danny Santos please come to the nurses' station on level three. Danny Santos, to level three nurses' station.",
        "Danny: I've got to... I've got to go find out what that's all about. Tony, why don't stay and go over some of the...",
        "Tony: It's okay. Go over some. You stay with Michelle. It's all right. I'll go, all right?",
        "Michelle: Wait, Tony?",
        "Tony: Yeah?",
        "Michelle: I'm starving. Do you think that you could see if they have any like, I don't know chocolate pudding or something?",
        "Tony: I'll see what I can do, Michelle, all right?",
        "Danny: Flan.",
        "Michelle: Who?",
        "Danny: Flan. That's your favorite dessert.",
        "Michelle: Right. Well, I'm in the mood for chocolate. All right, so fill me in. When is a rock more than a rock?",
        "Danny: Okay, I know it doesn't look like a lot, but it's actually a symbol for all the dreams that we had together.",
        "Michelle: Will our dreams sink like a stone? That was a joke.",
        "Danny: I know. I know.",
        "Michelle: I'm sorry. I know, you know, this isn't... it's not funny. I know that. This is just really hard for me, you know, because it's like I'm looking at all things that I have no clue about, and they're supposed to have some meaning attached to them, and they don't.",
        "Danny: Well, will you let me tell you about the rock then?",
        "Michelle: Sure.",
        "Danny: Okay. It's from a place called Laurel Falls. It's a beautiful place that you've always loved. And I bought some land there a couple years ago. We were going to build our dream house there.",
        "Michelle: Did we?",
        "Danny: No, we got another place, where we live now. It's a house that you have been nuts about ever since you were a kid, so I bought it for you.",
        "Michelle: Wow. That's... that's really sweet. You know, you seem like... you seem like a really nice guy.",
        "Danny: Michelle, I haven't always been.",
        "Michelle: That's just in case I never forgave you for not always being nice. All right. What about the seashell? Please, please, please tell me you, like, bought me an island somewhere or something.",
        "Danny: (Laughs) close, very close. It's... we have a villa on an island called San Cristobel. We don't have the greatest memories of the villa, but there is this one beach that is very special, and you love it. We both love it. And you picked up that seashell there.",
        "Michelle: You know, I think that I love the water.",
        "Danny: Mm-hmm.",
        "Michelle: I don't know, maybe I... I don't mind the water. And I can't even make this stuff up, you know, because I don't remember. I just don't. I don't remember. And you know what? I just feel all this pressure right now. I don't know, maybe it's these faces just staring at me. I just... they're like always looking at me.",
        "Danny: Michelle, they're you're friends and your family.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, well, they might as well be somebody else's, because I don't recognize one of them, not one of them. And they keep looking at me, and they're smiling at me, and they want something from me that I can't give them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Well, good morning, my young cutthroats. Only seven of you? I don't remember dismissing anyone.",
        "Lizzie: That's because Tammy's not here, and I really don't think she's coming back.",
        "Alan: Let me remind all of you, no one quits this job without my permission.",
        "Lizzie: Well, I think she just might be having some personal problems.",
        "Marina: Lizzie, you don't know any more than the rest of us.",
        "Lizzie: Well, I know she's not here.",
        "Tammy: I apologize, Mr. Spaulding. There was a huge, huge line at Company.",
        "Alan: Stopping for coffee is hardly a...",
        "Tammy: Double caf\u00e9, vanilla and nutmeg.",
        "Alan: Oh, just the way I like it, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: I did my research, sir.",
        "Alan: Well, I see you did. Are you ready to take on the world this morning?",
        "Tammy: Yes, sir.",
        "Alan: You probably spent around five dollars for this coffee, and Buzz Copper probably paid around fifty cents. Does anyone know what that is called?",
        "Lizzie: Robbery?",
        "Tammy: Charging what the market will bear.",
        "Alan: Excellent, Tammy. Excellent. You know, if you leave the house a little earlier, you probably won't be late next time. I want you all to know that you can't bring me any more apples. You see, Tammy beat you to the punch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Don't let me keep you from working out.",
        "Olivia: We have business to discuss.",
        "Bill: I don't believe we do, Olivia. I mean, you act like I owe you something. But that kiss the other night at the gala, I did that because I felt like it. There was no promise of a partnership on my lip.",
        "Olivia: You think this is about a kiss?",
        "Bill: Well, you said you were desperate.",
        "Olivia: You said you were tired of letting life run over. So stop it. Take control. You spent your entire life trying to prove yourself to Josh and Billy, and you trade them in for Alan and Phillip. You really think you could be your own man working with them?",
        "Bill: Look, I'm trying to be honest with you, Olivia. That's just the way it goes. I'm just not interested in working with you, okay? It's just not in my plans. Don't take it personally.",
        "Olivia: Well, it is personal for me.",
        "Bill: Well, maybe that's your problem.",
        "Olivia: No, you are my problem. And I can make your life very difficult.",
        "Bill: Well, you're too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Now, I think we all know who the winning team was: Elizabeth",
        "Lizzie: Joey, I think we would work really well together.",
        "Tammy: Surprise.",
        "Kira: Shayne, how about you and me?",
        "Marina: Kira, you don't waste any time, do you?",
        "Lizzie: I'm going to go get some water. Anyone want some? Okay. Grandpa, what do you think you're doing?",
        "Alan: I beg your pardon, Elizabeth? What are you talking about?",
        "Lizzie: Look, I need to know if you're going to give me what I asked for, okay, because I'm dancing around here as fast as I can to make this work, and you are not helping me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Anything you can do, I can do? Is that what's going on here?",
        "Olivia: You tell me.",
        "Bill: Well, I'm not the one issuing threats.",
        "Olivia: Well, at least I gave you a chance to save yourself. Accept my offer. Join me against Phil and Alan.",
        "Bill: Or else what?",
        "Olivia: You really want to find out?",
        "Bill: You just don't get it, Olivia, do you? There's nothing you can do to me. I mean, you talk tough, but I am not scared. I've got nothing to lose.",
        "Olivia: There's always something to lose.",
        "Bill: Well, you're tough, I'll give you that. But if you think you can take on the Spauldings, you're out of your league.",
        "Olivia: So are you. Just remember, you had your chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: And this is Mel, Rick's wife, and your sister-in- law, obviously.",
        "Michelle: She's pretty.",
        "Danny: Yeah. And a doctor here at Cedars, too.",
        "Michelle: Is everyone in my family a doctor?",
        "Danny: Yeah, pretty much.",
        "Michelle: Great. More stuff I've got to live up to.",
        "Danny: Let's see, who else? There's Mel with Blake and Harley. You work with her. You run a hotline for troubled teens. Actually, you started with...",
        "Michelle: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.",
        "Danny: What? What's the matter?",
        "Michelle: Danny. Danny.",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Michelle: Can we just stop? You know, because I'm barely remembering your name, and you're sitting right there in front of me, and I don't know how I'm supposed to be remembering the who's who of Springdale, you know?",
        "Danny: Springfield.",
        "Michelle: Whatever. Whatever. See, the thing is, I had to write my own name right here on the palm of my hand so I can remember who I'm supposed to be.",
        "Danny: I'm going too fast. I'm sorry.",
        "Michelle: No, it's not you.",
        "Danny: I am. I can... I'll go slower.",
        "Michelle: No, you know what? You know what? It is. It is actually you. Well, it's... well, it's really me. I just... I just... can we just stop trying to remember things just for like a minute, right?",
        "Tony: Danny. May I see you, please? Right now?",
        "Danny: I'll be right outside.",
        "Michelle: Take your time. Take a lot of time.",
        "Tony: Robbie is here.",
        "Danny: What? Oh, god, already? Oh, no. I called them last night, and he was so upset and homesick. I called Mike to have the nanny send him up for a couple of days.",
        "Tony: He wants his mother, Danny, you know.",
        "Danny: Yeah, yeah. Is he at the nurses' station?",
        "Tony: Yeah.",
        "Danny: Okay. Michelle, there's something I need to take care of, but I'll be back.",
        "Michelle: Well, I will be here.",
        "Danny: All right. Tony is going to stay here with you, okay?",
        "Michelle: So, you going to try to force feed names and faces down my throat?",
        "Tony: Not if you don't want me to, Michelle.",
        "Michelle: I think we can leave that up to my husband, right?",
        "Tony: Well, he does it because he loves you. You know that, right? He can't... he can't... he can't help it.",
        "Michelle: I know that. I just can't stand the look of disappointment on his face anymore. Can you get me out of here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: Coming up on \"Guiding Light\"...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: You saved my life, right?",
        "Tony: If you want to call it that, yeah.",
        "Michelle: So then you, you, are responsible for me.",
        "Josh: Well, you said you were worried about bill.",
        "Olivia: I was over at his place, seeing if there was anything he needed before the funeral. When I came in, he had a gun.",
        "Tammy: And no one wants to lose, especially not me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tony: I can't just take you out of the hospital.",
        "Michelle: How old am I? I mean, I've got to be at least 18, right, so I can check myself out.",
        "Tony: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Michelle: Oh, god, look, I've just got to get out of here. I just need some air. I just need some space, or something.",
        "Tony: I'll tell you what, when Danny comes back, we can...",
        "Michelle: Do you always do everything that Danny tells you to do? Is that what it is? I guess the real question is to why.",
        "Tony: Listen, do me a favor. Just stay here, please, okay?",
        "Michelle: Okay, but you saved my life, right?",
        "Tony: If you want to call it that, yeah.",
        "Michelle: So then you, you, are responsible for me.",
        "Tony: You just wait right here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Hi.",
        "Joey: Donut.",
        "Tammy: No thanks. Wait. Can't we spend like five seconds together without you catching on fire or something?",
        "Joey: Go ahead. That was a good one you pulled on Alan this morning. Pretty slick.",
        "Tammy: I wasn't trying to be slick.",
        "Joey: Oh, Tammy, you played the game and won. That's what Edmund would do, isn't it?",
        "Tammy: I don't care about Edmund! Joey, I like you. I want to be with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Grandpa, you said we were going to talk about dividing the groups into couples.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, I never used the word \"couples.\" Now, you asked to be placed with Joey Lupo.",
        "Lizzie: Yes, as a business decision. You said when there's something that I want to go after it.",
        "Alan: This is a competition, not a dating service. Now you will make do with whomever I assign you with.",
        "Lizzie: But grandpa, please!",
        "Alan: Please, Elizabeth, go back into the room.",
        "Joey: What do you want me to say, Tammy? No problem? You kiss your uncle, no big deal?",
        "Tammy: How many times can I say I'm sorry? What do you want me to do?",
        "Joey: Can you change your face? Because every time I look at you, I can't help but think about what you did to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tony: Michelle? I figured since you can't... I know you can't go. I figured you'd like company. This is Reva Lewis, one of your very close friends.",
        "Michelle: Okay.",
        "Reva: Hi, Michelle.",
        "Tony: I'll tell you what. I'm going to go out and make a phone call. Are you going to be here?",
        "Reva: Mm-hmm.",
        "Tony: All right.",
        "Michelle: So, um... so I guess I know you? If you expect me to remember anything, I...",
        "Reva: I don't. So, trying to cram all these faces into your head?",
        "Michelle: Well, Danny thinks that, you know, some of these might trigger a wave of memory, and we can all live happily ever after.",
        "Reva: But you don't feel that way.",
        "Michelle: No. No. No, I mean, I'm glad to know my own name right now, but, you know, the funny thing is, I don't think it's a name I would have chosen for myself.",
        "Reva: So what name would you rather have?",
        "Michelle: I don't know. I don't know. But, you know, Michelle is someone else's name. It's like... it's somebody that I don't know, somebody who I'm supposed to be, so I don't really know why I should even use her name at all.",
        "Reva: Maybe because it's much easier on everyone else, I suppose.",
        "Michelle: Well, I'm the one in the hospital.",
        "Reva: I know how hard this is.",
        "Michelle: Do you know who you are?",
        "Reva: Yes.",
        "Michelle: So then how could you possibly know?",
        "Reva: Maybe I should say I know who I am now, but that wasn't always the case.",
        "Michelle: You're kidding.",
        "Reva: No. There was a time when I was in this exact same place you are. I'd lost everything. I didn't know myself. I didn't know my husband. The world was a whole new place for me. But I was able to find my way back, and I believe you will, too.",
        "Michelle: So until then, I'm just supposed to sit around and wait?",
        "Reva: No. No, until then you live. I mean, life goes on, even if you can't remember what it was like before. I mean, right now you are creating new memories for the person you are right now. And it's okay. It's okay to like that new person.",
        "Michelle: Thank you. Thank you.",
        "Reva: For what?",
        "Michelle: For just saying out loud exactly what scares me the most.",
        "Reva: If you want, I can keep being that person.",
        "Michelle: Yeah.",
        "Reva: So what do you want me to call you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Hey! Oh, my gosh, look how big you got! Oh, I missed you so much. I did. How are you? Are you good? Did you have a good time at Uncle Mike's? You did? Hi, Judy.",
        "Judy: Hi.",
        "Danny: Have you been a good boy for Judy? Good. One minute. So what's going on?",
        "Robbie: Nothing.",
        "Danny: Nothing? You've been doing what I told you to do? Huh? Looking up at the stars every night? You remember what I told you, how when you're looking up at the stars, you know daddy is looking up at them, too, and that means we're underneath the same stars, which means that we're not very far apart from each other? Buddy, what's up? Huh, what's up?",
        "Robbie: I miss mommy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Josh, thanks for meeting me.",
        "Josh: Well, you said you were worried about bill.",
        "Olivia: I am.",
        "Josh: You know, he's still in the process of getting over Eden 's death.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, I know. But he's not handling it as well as he wants people to think he is.",
        "Josh: Maybe he just needs more time. It's not like I haven't been talking to him about it. He claims he's doing fine.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, of course he did. Look, I shouldn't even say anything, but I was over at his place, seeing if there was anything he needed before the funeral. And when I came in, he had a gun.",
        "Josh: A gun?",
        "Olivia: A gun. And the only reason I'm telling you this is because I know how much you love him. But Josh, if I didn't show up when I did...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: You might want to keep your left up.",
        "Tony: Just grab the bag, will you? She's awake, Bill-- Michelle.",
        "Bill: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you talking about? Is she all right?",
        "Tony: She doesn't remember anything-- nothing.",
        "Bill: What do you mean, about the accident?",
        "Tony: About anything, Bill-- not Rick, not Danny, not her own name. It's like her mind is a clean slate, man.",
        "Bill: All right, well, what... Tony, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait a minute now. What is the doctor saying? When is she going to get her memory back?",
        "Tony: Rick can't say. He can't say. Maybe in time.",
        "Bill: I've got to go see her.",
        "Tony: Don't! Bill, don't.",
        "Bill: What are you telling me, no? Why not?",
        "Tony: Because don't.",
        "Bill: Maybe she sees my face, and it will...",
        "Tony: Because Bill, if she doesn't remember her own husband, you think she's going to remember you? Huh, do you?",
        "Bill: Doesn't she remember Robbie at all?",
        "Tony: We haven't crossed that bridge yet, man. Listen, don't make a move without talking to Danny-- for Michelle's sake, okay? She's trying to start over.",
        "Bill: I guess we all are, huh?",
        "Tony: I guess so.",
        "Bill: Hey, listen, while I got you here, you want to hear a business proposition?",
        "Tony: About me and you working together, huh? Right? Is that what you're trying to say?",
        "Bill: Yeah, is that so hard to believe?",
        "Tony: Bill, come on, considering that you've hated my guts from day one, not to mention everything about me, yeah.",
        "Bill: Well, talk about a fresh start-- why don't you and I give it a shot?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Buddy, I need you to listen to me right now. Be a little man for me, okay? Can you do that? Mommy's not feeling very well right now, okay, so we need to let her rest. Does that make sense? Okay. It just means that you and I have to be extra special patient. Hey, you know what? Did I ever tell you mommy can hear you, even when you can't be with her? Do you know that? You do? Well, good. So all you have to do is say what you want to say to mommy in your head or out loud if you want, and she'll be able to feel what you're saying, because mommy knows everything you're doing and everything you're feeling. Is there something you want to say to mommy?",
        "Robbie: I picked this for your and mommy. I love you, mommy.",
        "Danny: Oh, buddy, she loves you too. She does.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Using every waking moment trying to keep track of everyone in this town, trying to figure out who you know or who you're supposed to know is going to make you crazy.",
        "Michelle: Already there.",
        "Reva: Even trying to figure out one person alone is a nightmare.",
        "Michelle: You mean, like my husband? You see, that even sounds weird to me, because I don't feel married. I mean, I just... I don't know, I don't... I just feel like... I just feel like I'm alive, and this guy Danny, you know, he's a character.",
        "Reva: Yes, he is.",
        "Michelle: And apparently, he's really loaded, I guess, or we are loaded, because he said he bought me some huge house that I loved when I was a kid, and we have a villa on an island, and land somewhere else.",
        "Reva: He's done quite well for himself, and for you.",
        "Michelle: What does he do?",
        "Reva: Danny? He's a self-made man.",
        "Michelle: You know, I think I can stand to learn a little bit, at least about one person that I've met.",
        "Reva: Well, that's a start. Who?",
        "Michelle: You.",
        "Reva: Oh, well, that's easy. I'm the town crazy.",
        "Michelle: No, you're not.",
        "Reva: Many would beg to differ.",
        "Michelle: All right. Well, just tell me. Tell me anyway.",
        "Reva: Okay. I am married to a man that I have loved pretty much my entire life. We have two children. Mara and Shayne are up there. And my husband's name is Josh, and I also have a son Dylan by Josh's brother Billy, and a son Sandy...",
        "Michelle: Okay, you get around much? And who's Sandy's father?",
        "Reva: He was a prince. Richard Winslow.",
        "Michelle: There's a prince in this town?",
        "Reva: No, actually in San Cristobel, where you have your villa. He passed away. But he was also married to my sister Cassie.",
        "Michelle: Is there like a shortage of eligible men around here?",
        "Reva: Oh, it gets better. Now Cassie is involved with Richard's brother Edmund.",
        "Michelle: Well, at least we're keeping it all in the family. Jeez.",
        "Reva: Now, you try.",
        "Michelle: Well, apparently my name is Michelle. And I don't really remember one lousy thing. Pleased to meet you.",
        "Reva: The pleasure has always been mine.",
        "Michelle: So what about me? I mean, did I at least have some sort of exciting past-- multiple husbands, tons of children?",
        "Reva: As a matter of fact, you are what we refer to in this town as normal. In fact, you're the paragon of normalcy.",
        "Michelle: Have I always been married to Danny?",
        "Reva: Well, Danny was pretty much it for you, Michelle. You married young. You had a couple of bumps in the road, but you pulled through. I know that this is a difficult time for you. But you have something that I never had after my accident. You have family.",
        "Michelle: Where was your family?",
        "Reva: Nowhere to be seen. I remember part of me could feel Josh, so I knew that there was someone out there somewhere. But beyond that, that was it. You have Danny. And you love each other. And I know that somewhere deep inside of you, you know it too.",
        "Michelle: I don't know. I don't. I don't know him, so how can I know if I love him or not?",
        "Reva: Love isn't just about memories. It's also about feelings. You and Danny have one of those epic, romantic love stories of all time. Trust that. But most important, trust him.",
        "Michelle: Oh, it would just be so much easier if it could all just, you know, suddenly come back to me, and then I could just be what everyone expects me to be.",
        "Reva: You don't have to do that. All you have to do is be who you are-- whoever that is at any given moment. I'd really like to come back and see you again.",
        "Michelle: Oh, please, please do.",
        "Reva: Okay. You take care of yourself.",
        "Michelle: Why don't I feel anything for you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Now, your teams are as follows. Team one: Shayne and Kira.",
        "Kira: Power of positive thinking.",
        "Alan: Team two: Marina and Sandy.",
        "Sandy: Sorry, man. I'll take good care of her.",
        "Alan: Team three... and may I remind you that in a business partnership, you don't have to like the person you're working with. He or she may have strengths where you're weak, and you may be strong where he or she is weak.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, yeah, okay. Grandpa, what's team three?",
        "Alan: Team three is Tammy and Remy. And team four is Elizabeth and Joey.",
        "Lizzie: That works.",
        "Alan: Now, are there any questions? If there are, figure the answer out among yourselves. Good luck, and don't embarrass me.",
        "Marina: Well, Kira, you're willing to make things happen worked like a charm.",
        "Kira: Maybe you didn't will hard enough.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, will shmill. It's all about hard work.",
        "Tammy: Well, having connections like granddaddy running the show doesn't hurt either.",
        "Lizzie: Tammy, I told you months ago: If you want something, you've got to go for it. Isn't that right, Joey? We're going to win this thing.",
        "Joey: I like our chances.",
        "Tammy: Well, just remember, everyone else is going for it too, and no one wants to lose, especially not me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Look, I probably just caught him at a bad time.",
        "Josh: No, no. Just... you know what, tell me about Bill and the gun. What was he planning on doing with it?",
        "Olivia: I don't know. He was very emotional for obvious reasons. And then Tony Santos came in, and they got into it.",
        "Josh: What, he was going to shoot Tony?",
        "Olivia: I don't know. I just know the gun was loaded. I don't know who he wanted to use it on. Look, I've said too much, okay. He took me into his confidence.",
        "Josh: No, no, I'm sorry. I appreciate what you're doing here. You did the right thing.",
        "Olivia: He was overwhelmed-- everything that's happened with Eden, the pressure of running Lewis. I just... I thought you should know.",
        "Josh: Thank you. Thanks for coming to me. And I will take care of it.",
        "Olivia: Sorry, Bill.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: So you and Danny sent me packing from the hospital the other day, said drop my old grudges, huh?",
        "Tony: Yeah, that's right. We meant it.",
        "Bill: Well, that's what I'm doing.",
        "Tony: Glad to hear it.",
        "Bill: So, look, I'm going to need a little union support. I figure with Salerno out of the way, you're going to be the man, and I could use some friends.",
        "Tony: Wait, hold on. You and me friends, same category? What's that?",
        "Bill: Well, Tony, call it what you like, all right? You're going to like my terms.",
        "Tony: I can't talk about this right now, Bill. I've got to get back to the hospital. I'll see you around.",
        "Bill: Yeah. You just keep me in mind.",
        "Tony: I might.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Reva, hi.",
        "Reva: Hi.",
        "Danny: Have you seen Michelle?",
        "Reva: Oh, honey, yes. I know how heartbreaking and difficult this must be for you.",
        "Danny: I have to ask you, how does she seem to you?",
        "Reva: About as well as can be expected. You know, she looks the same, but she isn't.",
        "Danny: Right. I know.",
        "Reva: I know you want her back, and I know it's tearing you apart, but...",
        "Danny: What, am I doing something wrong?",
        "Reva: No. No, not \"wrong\" per se. But I think Michelle is going to need some space.",
        "Danny: I can't do that. I can't do that. She doesn't know who she is. She doesn't remember any of her life. I have to be with her all the time, helping her remember that there are people who love her. She has a child and a husband. I can't give her space. I can't do that.",
        "Reva: Honey, she needs to have time to figure things out on her own.",
        "Danny: No, Reva, she can't do that. There is no time for that, because the Michelle in that room doesn't think there's anything to be figured out.",
        "Reva: Danny, if you push too hard, you're going to scare her away.",
        "Danny: I know that, but this isn't just about me. There's Robbie, and I just saw him, and he's begging to see her. And I can't let him see her until I can make her understand.",
        "Reva: Make her?",
        "Danny: Reva, my son is going to see his mother. He needs to see her and know that she loves him, even if Michelle has to fake it.",
        "Reva: I understand. I do. I understand what you're going through. I know what she's going through. If you need to talk to someone, you call Josh. He knows better than anyone what you're feeling right now. Please, call him.",
        "Danny: Okay.",
        "Reva: Call me, anytime.",

        "Cassie: Brenda couldn't be here, so I came instead. I hope you don't mind.",
        "Danny: Michelle doesn't remember who she is. How is she supposed to know who she can trust? We have to find her."
