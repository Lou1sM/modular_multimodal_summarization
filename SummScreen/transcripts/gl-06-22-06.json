        "Mallet: Fianc\u00e9. Right. These are for you.",
        "Dinah: Sweetie, these are beautiful. You feeling guilty about something?",
        "Mallet: Mmm, yeah, actually I'm feeling guilty for spending money on these when you don't appreciate them. Okay, okay. Why don't we call them \"Thank you for saying yes when I proposed\" flowers?",
        "Dinah: Sweetie, there was never any doubt. Thank you, they're beautiful.",

        "Mallet: Okay.",
        "Dinah: Okay? They're gorgeous. Thank you.",
        "Marina: Hey, Dinah. I know I'm early, but I really have to talk to you about my plan to nail Alan-Michael.",
        "Dinah: Okay.",
        "Marina: I know that you're not...",
        "Dinah: Everybody asks me who does my nails. Okay, I'll give you the number.",
        "Mallet: Oh, hey.",
        "Marina: Oh! Hi, Mallet. Flowers.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, flowers.",

        "Dinah: ( Laughs ) He's sexy.",
        "Marina: Sorry about that. I didn't know he was here.",
        "Dinah: It's okay. What were you saying about Alan-Michael?",
        "Marina: You know, um, right now is probably not a good time. So, uh, why don't you give me a call on my cell? Do you have a pen?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, um... I think I have a pen. Somewhere around here. Honey, do we have pens anymore, in this room?",
        "Mallet: Uh, yeah, look in my jacket.",

        "Gus: Hey, Harley, it's me. Just wanted you to know I'm on the straight and narrow, and uh, was wondering if you're going to come home.",

        "Ava: Coming up here to watch the sunrise was a great idea.",
        "Coop: Yeah?",
        "Ava: Yeah. Of course, it was three hours ago...",
        "Coop: Hey. Are you saying you're getting sick of me already?",
        "Ava: Are you kidding? I was sick of you a long time ago.",
        "Coop: What?",
        "Ava: ( Laughs )",
        "Coop: Please.",
        "Ava: No, never. Why, are you getting sick of me already?",

        "Ava: Hmm?",
        "Coop: No. Never.",
        "Ava: Good.",
        "Coop: Good, good, good. So, I guess we should go, then?",

        "Buzz: Lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: Hey, that's from the nursery. Where are you going with it?",
        "Buzz: Uh... Coop wanted me to get rid of it.",
        "Lizzie: He's emptying out the nursery? Why? Oh. To make room for Ava.",
        "Buzz: Do you want to torture yourself?",
        "Lizzie: No, I don't, I just...",
        "Buzz: Then go home.",
        "Lizzie: This is all your fault!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: I think the most important thing here is that we protect Harley from Alan-Michael, and if we work together, I really believe that we can do that, Dinah. Dinah?",
        "Dinah: No. No. Marina, you can't do this, because it's going to be too tempting for you. And you're only going to get hurt.",
        "Marina: Hurt? Please, I'm a cop.",
        "Dinah: You're also a woman.",
        "Marina: Dinah, I don't think you're getting this. I am so totally over the guy.",
        "Dinah: Completely?",
        "Marina: Yes. Completely. Totally. 100% totally and completely over Alan- Michael Spaulding. I wouldn't be with him if he were the last man on earth. But he is crazy about me , and I think that I can use that to get us the information we need about Harley.",
        "Dinah: All right, so hypothetically, you're telling me it won't freak you out in the least if in some way, you have to kiss Alan-Michael to get information from him.",
        "Marina: It's just part of the job.",
        "Dinah: You hope. Marina, look, um... I don't think that this is a good idea. I think it's real bad to-- you know, put your hopes into somebody and play with their feelings in that way. Even if somebody has done some bad stuff in their life, his or her life, they have flaws. They have major flaws. And it's not fair for you to get their hopes up that high.",
        "Marina: And since when are you Alan-Michael's best friend?",
        "Dinah: I'm not. I'm just saying I think you and I have to find a way to neutralize this whole thing, okay? And so give me a day to think about a different plan, a different approach. And in the meantime, I want you to stay away from this guy, all right? Because I don't think you're over him as much as you think you are.",
        "Mallet: Dinah? Hey. Is everything all right with Marina?",
        "Dinah: Fine.",
        "Mallet: All right. I've to get going.",
        "Dinah: Where?",
        "Mallet: I'm going to run some errands and then I'm going to go to work, and... I love you. And I'll see you later.",

        "Jonathan: Ow, what the hell? Knock it off!",
        "Lizzie: It's all your fault! Why?! Why did you come to my wedding and open your big fat mouth? You took Coop from me and you just handed him right to Ava. You just pushed him right into her long freaking arms! Coop. Hey, you look great. Coop!",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) Hey, that went really well. That went good.",
        "Lizzie: You see that door? That's your future, too, because Tammy's never going to take you back. Are you glad that you did the right thing now? You ruined my life, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, would you stop with the drama queen crap and start showing me some respect. I am the father of your kid.",
        "Lizzie: Only by a cruel act of nature.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah? You liked it, babe. Takes two, doesn't it. And don't lay this \"Coop dumped me\" crap on me either, because you need to just start thinking about what you're going to do to fix it.",
        "Lizzie: I don't suppose you have any ideas?",
        "Jonathan: Whoa. How to ice Legs McGee? No, I, uh... I don't have a clue. I have my own stuff to deal with, but I'm sure with your imagination, you'll be fine.",
        "Gus: Hey, Lizzie, how's the baby?",
        "Lizzie: Drop dead.",
        "Gus: Okay. Well, rumor has it I missed quite a wedding. Kind of like the first time I tried to marry your daughter.",

        "Alan-Michael: Well, hold on. I was... the desk called up, there's a package for me downstairs, but it can wait. How would you feel about visiting another friend?",
        "Marina: You mean you?",
        "Alan-Michael: All I'm talking about is a cup of coffee, Marina. So we can catch up.",

        "Regina: I know that it's kind of wimpy to admit this, but, uh... I was scared.",
        "Mallet: That's okay. But you don't have to be scared anymore. Because he's back in prison, and we can go back to living our lives. And I guess you, uh, you don't need a bodyguard anymore.",

        "Reva: I... I was. Am. I am.",
        "Jonathan: No, no no. You made it seem like you weren't going to make it? Like if you were going to die, your dying wish was that you wanted me to get you your grandchild? So I go over to Coop and Lizzie's wedding, bust in, stop the thing, say, \"Hey everybody, that's not his baby, it's mine!\" And look where it got me.",
        "Reva: You stopped the wedding? You told the truth?",

        "Reva: I know.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I know you know. Because it's exactly what you're doing with Josh. You're protecting him from the fact that you have cancer, right? Well, guess what, Mom? I fessed up. Now it's your turn. Either you tell Josh that you're sick, or I will.",

        "Reva: You told the truth because you knew it was the right thing.",
        "Jonathan: I wish you could have seen the look on Tammy's face. I slept with her friend. I got her friend pregnant. I might as well have taken a knife and stabbed it in her guts. On top of all that, I might be chained to psycho Lizzie Spaulding for the rest of my life.",
        "Reva: Honey, it's not a chain. It's a baby. It is a baby who won't feel abandoned now, the way you felt that I abandoned you.",

        "Regina: Was it so awful?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, it was not... it was not good. It was not good. All right, and don't tell me that you'd like to do that again. That you'd settle for being \"the other woman\" again.",

        "Mallet: Because I loved her. Because I loved her. I loved Harley deeply. I loved her desperately. And I didn't think I deserved her, so you know what? I found a way to screw that up. And I lived with that mistake for years, wishing and wanting to take it back. And now, by the grace of God, I've been given another chance, another chance with a really amazing woman.",

        "Marina: Oh, whatever.",
        "Alan-Michael: Whatever? I would think that would matter to you a lot. Yes, I wanted you and the company at the same time. But I don't think either wish is unreasonable. Nor are they mutually exclusive. I still don't think that. But I should have had the guts to be up front with you about it. I tried to tell you a couple of times, but I was afraid of losing you.

        "Dinah: Oh, well, I was right.",
        "Mallet: You were right. I was the target, not you. So... now the guy's back in prison, case closed, problem solved, and um... I guess you'll be heading home now, right, Regina?",

        "Mallet: Uh, I'm a cop and I can spot a tail?",
        "Dinah: Oh, yes, you can. You can hold a hand real good, too. So I wouldn't have followed you if you had told me where you were going. So why didn't you tell me where you were going?",
        "Mallet: Because I know you, and I know you get jealous when there's no reason to be.",
        "Dinah: Unless that's what you wanted.",
        "Mallet: What? Why would I want you to be jealous?",
        "Dinah: I don't know, Mallet. Maybe you're getting cold feet about this wedding. And you're just not saying it. Well? Do you deny it?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I do deny it. You know what's really interesting about all of this? The fact that your mind went to a place like that tells me that uh... maybe you're the one who's having the misgivings.",
        "Dinah: Why would you even think I would be capable of thinking that?",
        "Mallet: Why would you think that about me?",
        "Dinah: Because you're the one who lied, Mallet.",
        "Mallet: You followed me.",

        "Reva: When are you going to get it through that thick head of yours that I'm doing this to protect Josh? And you.",
        "Jonathan: Reva knows best, huh?",
        "Reva: I'm sorry you're mad. I am. But this is going to work out. And I'm going to tell Josh when the time is right.",
        "Jonathan: Oh. I hope I get tickets to that show. Who's your next victim, Reva? You've pushed Josh away. You've ruined my freaking life with Tammy. Who's next on the fix-it list?",
        "Reva: I know it's going to work out.",
        "Jonathan: You think you know everything.",
        "Reva: Hey!",
        "Jonathan: Like telling me to claim Lizzie's baby.",
        "Reva: Your baby! Just tell me exactly what Tammy said when she found out.",
        "Jonathan: Not much. She was pretty freaked out and pretty mad. And I thought I had a chance when Cassie told me I could talk to her, but... I don't know.",
        "Reva: She does know that you only slept with Lizzie after she broke up with you, right?",
        "Jonathan: No. I forgot to tell her that. Of course she knows that, Reva! She's not even that freaked out about the fact that I slept with Lizzie. What really upset her is the whole lie about the baby. Now no matter what happens between us, things are always going to be different.",
        "Reva: It'll work out.",
        "Jonathan: No. Not with this baby hanging around always over my head. Because now if the baby comes out and I turn my back on it, and I ignore it, Tammy is going to think I'm some kind of creep. Or, if the baby comes out, and I play dada and coo to it and feed it a bottle and take it to the park, Tammy's...",
        "Reva: You might like it.",
        "Jonathan: No. I don't want this baby in Tammy's face. Every time she looks at it, she's going to love me less and less.",
        "Reva: She may love you more, because it's part of you, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Reva, you've got to back off. I did something for you; now you do something for me. Shut up about Lizzie's baby.",
        "Reva: Your baby!",
        "Jonathan: Fine! I admitted it's my baby! That is all I am going to do! If, by some miracle, Tammy takes me back, she will be my priority from now on, Reva. She is what I care about, not some baby that I didn't even want in the first place.",

        "Ava: There is no three of us. There's me and Coop. And then there's you. And then there's you flying around in the radar up here somewhere, not being detected.",
        "Lizzie: Wow, somebody's pretty sure of herself.",
        "Ava: Wow, somebody's really delusional thinking Coop wants anything to do with her.",
        "Lizzie: No, Ava. I know the score. I know that Coop is over me. For the moment. But the baby? There's no way he's over her.",
        "Ava: Oh, Jonathan's baby? The baby you've been lying to Coop about for months?",
        "Lizzie: Lie or no lie, Coop still loves this baby.",
        "Ava: He thought she was his.",
        "Lizzie: That's how it started. But once a love like that starts, I mean, you can't just turn it off. Especially not for someone like Coop, who feels things so deeply.",
        "Ava: You actually believe what you're saying?",
        "Lizzie: Listen to me. Coop is hurt, okay? So of course he's going to deny how he's really feeling, but pretty soon he is going to start to question his choice. Not just about the baby, but about you, too. Actually, you'll probably start to question him as well.",
        "Ava: Yeah? How do you figure?",
        "Lizzie: Come on, Ava. He left you for me. Didn't he? That's got to hurt.",
        "Ava: It was out of obligation, not because he loved you, babe.",
        "Lizzie: Still, part of you has to be angry at him. And you have to be wondering whether you'll ever be able to trust him again.",
        "Coop: Lizzie. That's enough. Get out.",
        "Lizzie: I was just trying to be honest.",
        "Ava: For a change. She thinks you're going to be the father to her child.",
        "Coop: Why would I want to be a father to a child that's not even mine?",
        "Lizzie: It's true. I can see it in your eyes.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, what you see is me being done with you. I'm done.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, fine, I'll go. But I know that I'm right, Coop. I know you still love this baby.",
        "Ava: You okay?",
        "Coop: Fine. You?",
        "Ava: Well, I'm not so sure. I find myself in the awkward position of actually agreeing with Lizzie for a change.",
        "Coop: About what?",
        "Ava: How could you not have feelings for this baby? I mean, you're only human.",
        "Coop: Ava, how could I have feelings for a kid that's not even mine to begin with?",
        "Ava: Because that's the kind of guy you are, Coop. And you didn't bring it up to me. I don't know, maybe you thought I would be upset, I wouldn't understand. But the reality of the situation is, you know, if you lie and you underestimate me, we're not going to be having a healthy relationship here.",

        "Marina: Oh, no. No, Dinah, really, you were right.",
        "Dinah: No, you know, I think it's actually a good idea that you reel this guy in. I think that's one of the only ways you're going to get close to him and see what's happening, and, like you said, you're a cop, and you're going to keep your feelings out of the mix, and um... you know, if you have to play footsie with him a little bit, I don't think that's so bad. I'm sure you can handle it. It's not like you're going to be sleeping with him.",
        "Marina: No. God, no.",
        "Dinah: Yeah. So tomorrow you can give me a call, and we will find a way to get you closer to him and in his orbit. And he won't know what hit him.",

        "Gus: No, actually, I have nothing to do. I don't even have a job, so I don't have any money, so I'm not going to go buy anything that's not good for me like booze or... I can't even take caffeine. But I could go home and watch TV and I could remind myself how miserable my life is. I could do that.",

        "Gus: I thought you were mad at me.",
        "Buzz: I am.",
        "Gus: I thought that you and Frank were trying to avoid me.",

        "Gus: How is she?",
        "Buzz: More to the point, how are you?",

        "Buzz: That's fantastic! That is fantastic! God!",
        "Gus: Yeah. Well, Dinah had a little chat with me, and it kind of pushed me over the hump. And so five days, five days... who are you calling?",
