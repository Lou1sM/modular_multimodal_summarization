        "Jeffrey: Just give me... Give me...",
        "Cassie: Give me the towel! Look, I fell asleep and my bathtub overflowed, and I woke up to him pounding on my door waking me up.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. I usually wait till the morning to take my showers, but she didn't give me much choice.",
        "Edmund: You must have been exhausted.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Yes. And everything is a mess. And his room is trashed, and it's going to cost me a thousand dollars in sheet rocking.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, you think?",
        "Cassie: Hi, it's me. Look, my bathtub overflowed. There is a waterfall in Mr. O'Neill's room. Can you please send Pete or Mike up here to check everything out? Great. Thank you. They're working on it.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, how long are they going to be working on it?",
        "Cassie: I don't know, Mr. O'Neill. We don't know how much damage has been done, okay?",
        "Jeffrey: And what am I supposed to do in the meantime?",
        "Edmund: Why don't you go down to the lobby, Mr. O'Neill, and have a drink on me?",
        "Jeffrey: Put your money away, Mr. Ambassador. I can't work with people coming in and out.",
        "Cassie: Fine. But I will move you to another room.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, that's just great. That's just great.",
        "Cassie: Good morning, it's Cassie.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm inconvenienced because you can't figure out how to turn your own bath water off. Wonderful, Mrs. Winslow. Another evening completely ruined because of you. I changed my mind about that drink.",

        "Gus: You've got to keep it clean, okay?",
        "Harley: (Laughs)",

        "Gus: Are you kidding me? You're joking me, right?",
        "Harley: All right, how about this? I love you. I love you. I have never been happier. I love you. I've never been more in love with anyone in my whole life. How's that?",
        "Gus: Is that right? That's a little better.",
        "Harley: I have to say this, though. I just... I think that my cop instincts have really gotten a little more rusty than I thought, because I just... I didn't see this coming at all.",
        "Gus: Right. Well, that's because we've been very preoccupied with things that are so less important than us. And we have to kind of get back to you and me, you know.",
        "Harley: Me and you.",
        "Gus: Absolutely.",
        "Harley: You and me.",

        "Danny: Why?",
        "Michelle: Well, we won't become so lax about our date night.",
        "Danny: Oh, come on, Michelle, we've been really good about keeping the romance alive.",

        "Michelle: But you know the curse of the old married couple.",
        "Danny: I do.",

        "Danny: Hey, that works both ways, you know.",
        "Michelle: I know. But you know we don't have to worry about that, because we skipped the married part and things will stay fresh.",
        "Danny: Free from the curse.",
        "Michelle: Yes, and uncomplicated. Besides, you know, if we're happy, that's all that matters, right?",
        "Danny: Right. Right. It's just a formality anyway.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, it's one that we've already experienced.",
        "Danny: Right.",
        "Michelle: We made the right decision, Danny. We did.",

        "Eden: Yeah, if he catches him.",
        "Bill: Hey, listen to me. You have to think positively, all right? They're going to catch this guy. And when they do, we can go anyplace, we can do anything we want. Mm-hmm.",
        "Eden: Well, why can't we do anything we want right now?",
        "Bill: Well, we can. But I have to do something first, okay?",
        "Eden: What could be more important than having dessert with me right now?",
        "Bill: All right, I will hurry. Okay, I'll be back soon. I promise.",
        "Eden: What? No appetite?",

        "Eden: Okay.",
        "Bill: Okay. (Knocking at the door)",
        "Eden: What did you forget now? (Screams)",
        "Photographer: Who do you think is doing this to you, Eden?",
        "Eden: Stop this.",
        "Photographer: Huh? You think you're next on the killer's list?",
        "Eden: Get out of here!",
        "Tony: Hey!",

        "Danny: Oh, now who's starting to sound a little jaded, huh?",
        "Michelle: No, I'm just realistic, because life has a way of throwing you some wicked curb balls.",
        "Danny: True. But we've knocked most of ours out of the park.",
        "Michelle: We did. We went through a lot.",
        "Danny: And then some.",

        "Michelle: Right.",
        "Danny: Honey? Hey, listen to me. I don't want you to think that our life is just one drama after another, and that you've got to be prepared for anything to happen, because that's in our past. I'm going to make sure that... That Springfield and our lives stay very calm.",
        "Michelle: Well, not too calm, I hope.",
        "Danny: Oh, no, you'll never be bored with me.",
        "Michelle: Well, that I wasn't really worried about. You know, I do... I like the fact that we're not totally traditional.",
        "Danny: What? Since when?",
        "Michelle: I know. In the beginning, it scared me. But now, I wouldn't change anything about us, not anymore.",
        "Danny: Marital status included?",
        "Michelle: We don't need that. We're going to go straight to the happily ever after.",
        "Danny: No pit stop at the altar?",
        "Michelle: Nope.",

        "Blake: Yeah, yeah, yeah, sugar.",
        "Gus: Let me ask you something, because, it's just... I've got to... You know, I'm thinking to myself. I just proposed 20 minutes ago, and then, bang, you're at the door, and you're looking at... Checking out the rock. What, are you like the... You got the Reva Lewis thing? Whoa! You got that going on?",
        "Blake: Oh, she called me.",

        "Harley: When you were doing the dishes? It was really quick.",
        "Gus: Is that right?",
        "Harley: I just didn't think you were going to be coming over so soon, Blake.",
        "Gus: Oh.",
        "Blake: Yeah, but I just thought that Alan was still here.",
        "Gus: No, you see, I thought it would be best if my father wasn't here, because it was kind of killing the mood. But...",

        "Harley: Yes, he did. I'm engaged. (Laughs)",
        "Blake: I ought to help you mess up more often. Next time you'll get a pair of earrings out of it.",

        "Gus: All right. So what's up?",
        "Bill: Well, I need to talk to you about your sister.",
        "Gus: Yeah. What about her?",
        "Bill: I'm just starting to wonder if you're doing everything you can to make sure she's safe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tony: Get up. Get up.",
        "Eden: Be careful.",

        "Edmund: Then why don't you put on some dry clothes and get back to work?",
        "Jeffrey: I would like to get back to work as soon as your girly friend finds me a room-- if she ever finds me a room.",
        "Cassie: Hold a second. We're booked solid, okay? There's a court reporters' convention.",
        "Jeffrey: In Springfield?",
        "Edmund: Why don't you try the Regency, Mr. O'Neill? It's really much closer to your office.",
        "Cassie: Right.",
        "Jeffrey: Do I intimidate you or something, Winslow?",
        "Edmund: Hardly.",
        "Cassie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jeffrey: Because, you know, let me just let you in on a little secret. Chicks, they don't like insecure guys. Big turnoff.",

        "Cassie: I'll get you one first thing in the morning.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, you know what? Don't bother, okay? You've wasted enough of my time already.",
        "Edmund: Then how about the Regency? Here, Mr. O'Neill, let me show you the door. Don't bump your head on the way out, and have a very good night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: You're kidding me with what you just said, right?",
        "Bill: No. Look, Gus, I need to know.",
        "Gus: Well, Bill, there's a whack job out there after my sister, and even if I wasn't a cop, I'd never let anything ever happen to her.",
        "Bill: Right. Right. Look, I'm sorry. I guess I just needed to hear you say it.",
        "Gus: But don't get me wrong. I mean, it's very nice to hear somebody else concerned about her well-being.",
        "Bill: Yeah. Yeah, I care about her. It's just driving me nuts that something could happen, you know. And it's driving me nuts that she feels so cooped up all the time.",
        "Gus: Well, my sister is not easy to keep in one place very long.",
        "Bill: Right. But I'm thinking maybe we could fix that.",
        "Gus: Well, what did you have in mind?",
        "Bill: Four-dollar movie house down on Route 59, the one by the old skating rink.",
        "Gus: Now, Bill, Bill...",
        "Bill: Gus, it's not a high-traffic area.",
        "Gus: No, no, no, no.",
        "Bill: On weeknights you're going to find maybe ten, 12 people there, tops.",
        "Gus: Movie theaters are dark. There's a lot people there. Why?",
        "Bill: Well, why not?",
        "Gus: All right. You know what happened at the country club? Lights go out. I mean, come on, do we have to go through this stuff?",
        "Bill: Yeah, but look, you know what I could do? I could rent the place out for a night.",
        "Gus: Well, that's a very nice thought and everything.",
        "Bill: Gus, your sister, she needs normal, okay? And she needs cheering up. I mean, I know she puts on this tough act, but underneath it all she's scared.",
        "Gus: You can tell that, huh?",
        "Bill: Yeah. She needs a diversion. In fact, I think we both do.",
        "Gus: You care about my sister?",
        "Bill: Yeah, I do. I do. And I'm going to do everything I can to make sure she's okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: You know, how does someone cut off the power, they sneak in, find their victim in the dark, steal her jewelry, kill her, and then get out of there without getting caught?",
        "Harley: With a great deal of calculation.",
        "Blake: Yeah, well, we should be talking about who was in that room.",
        "Harley: Well, we know it wasn't us.",
        "Blake: Yeah, or Frank or Gus. Hey, what about Frank's date?",
        "Harley: Darci? Well, she was alone in the dark when Frank went to investigate, but they were together when the lights went out.",
        "Blake: Yeah. What about Alex's date? He was pretty creepy.",
        "Harley: Yeah, that's a real possibility, except it turns out he's got alibis for two of the murders.",
        "Blake: Yeah, well, we should be making a list.",
        "Harley: I've got a name we can put on that list. What about Ben?",
        "Blake: Oh, no, I don't think so.",
        "Harley: Blake, come on.",
        "Blake: Oh, I know that he's had his moments since he's come to town, but he's not a killer.",
        "Harley: He was in the room.",
        "Blake: So was Eden.",
        "Harley: Let's skip Eden.",
        "Blake: Oh, I don't think so. You of all people have to admit to that possibility.",
        "Harley: I do not-- not if I want to marry her brother, I do not.",

        "Marah: Here, can I get you guys some iced tea or something?",
        "Eden: Yeah.",
        "Tony: Sounds good. Look, I'm sorry I snapped.",
        "Eden: No, you don't have to apologize. You did the right thing. Marah just doesn't understand.",
        "Tony: No.",
        "Eden: I mean, it's the life. She just... She doesn't get it.",
        "Tony: You have to do what you have to do to stay alive, right?",
        "Eden: Right. And to protect your friends.",
        "Tony: And my girlfriend. It's just that this reminds her of a really bad time for us, and that kills me.",
        "Eden: I'm sorry, Tony.",
        "Tony: Yeah, me, too. You think... What, you think I like scanning the license plates of cars before we go into a restaurant? You think I like figuring out the best exit?",
        "Eden: Well, that's what you've got to do, right, to stay alive? Do you think I wanted this life, Tony? No, I hate it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: It's just been so crazy, Edmund. It's been so crazy with the kids and the hotel. I mean, there's just been one thing after another.",
        "Edmund: It's all right. I understand.",
        "Cassie: And I didn't mean to fall sleep. I did not mean to fall asleep.",
        "Edmund: I know. I know.",
        "Cassie: And there's that jerk, Jeffrey O'Neill. He is so irritating.",
        "Edmund: Yes, I know that, too.",
        "Cassie: What is it with him? I mean, that man is never satisfied with anything.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, you flooded his suite.",
        "Cassie: So? You know, what goes around comes around.",
        "Edmund: Yes, I know that.",
        "Cassie: I mean, everything with Tammy. You know, he was such a jerk after that, and all stuff with R.J. and his toys, and now this. I mean, he is so irritating!",
        "Edmund: Yes, I think we've established that.",
        "Cassie: I'm babbling.",
        "Edmund: Madly. But it's very cute.",
        "Cassie: I'm sorry.",
        "Edmund: Don't be. Are you nervous?",
        "Cassie: Very.",
        "Edmund: Well, just try and relax. The evening started off a little wet. There's nothing wrong with that. It doesn't matter. So just relax. Does that feel better?",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, all day long you've been doing for others, and I think it's time someone took care of you.",
        "Cassie: I don't even know what that feels like anymore.",
        "Edmund: All right, then let me remind you. How many meals did you serve in the hotel? A hundred?",
        "Cassie: A lot. Not a hundred.",
        "Edmund: All right, all right. Regardless, did you take any time out in all that time to feed yourself? A snack even?",
        "Cassie: No. There wasn't time. There was no time.",
        "Edmund: All right. All right then. Come on.",
        "Cassie: Thank you.",
        "Edmund: You're welcome.",
        "Cassie: Aren't you going to join me?",
        "Edmund: I will, in a minute. But right now, I'm enjoying this far too much.",
        "Cassie: That feels so good. You have no idea.",
        "Edmund: Good. I'm glad.",
        "Cassie: Don't stop.",
        "Edmund: I have no intentions of stopping, not until you tell me to.",

        "Danny: I think the celebration ended a little early, don't you?",
        "Michelle: No, I think I heard them say they're getting a room upstairs.",
        "Danny: Well, they've got all night. What's the rush?",
        "Michelle: Oh, you really don't know?",
        "Danny: Oh, please. I know that a woman wants her man to take his time, reel her in.",
        "Michelle: Uh-huh. Are you know this from experience, Mr. Santos?",
        "Danny: Maybe.",
        "Michelle: Are you trying to make me blush?",
        "Danny: I don't need to try. Look at you. You're already getting red.",
        "Michelle: Stop.",
        "Danny: I've only just begun.",
        "Michelle: Maybe we should get ourselves a little room upstairs.",
        "Danny: Mm. This is good.",
        "Michelle: It's better than good, actually.",
        "Danny: I was so miserable when we weren't together. I don't know what I would have done.",

        "Eden: I am just so sick of this. I'm just so sick of everything being so messed up. I mean, I was... I was this close to having it all.",
        "Tony: Eden, you run an escort service.",
        "Eden: Yeah, and for me that is a step above of what I was doing. You know, we're both the same. Don't you get that?",
        "Tony: Well, yeah, I mean, we both worked really hard for change. I mean, you wouldn't be here if I didn't believe that. But, what, you think it's going to be a piece of cake? I mean, the way that I look at it, this is just a test, to see if you can really cut it.",
        "Eden: Yeah, believe me, I can cut it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: It's just that I never dated anyone like your sister.",
        "Gus: Mm-hmm. I bet.",
        "Bill: I mean, we are an unlikely pair, though.",
        "Gus: Mm-hmm.",

        "Gus: (Laughs)",
        "Bill: What's so funny?",
        "Gus: I got engaged tonight.",

        "Bill: Wait, did I just walk in on that?",
        "Gus: No, no.",
        "Bill: Is that what happened here? Because if I did...",
        "Gus: Blake beat you to it, so it's nothing. It's fine.",
        "Bill: I'm sorry. Look, the last thing I want to do is get on Harley's bad side, really.",
        "Gus: No, no. I mean, she... Her bark is a lot worse than her bite.",
        "Bill: Yeah, yeah, well, I got one of those, too.",
        "Gus: Yeah. About my sister, she's a little... Well, she's a tough nut to crack. I'm warning you.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, she's worth it.",
        "Gus: Who would have thought? Me and Eden trying to make a normal life for ourselves. Now, if she could just get out of the hooker business.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: That girl asked for trouble the minute she opened up the Garden of Eden.",
        "Harley: No doubt, Blake. But I cannot go spouting off to the world accusing Eden of murder. I have no proof.",
        "Blake: Since when are you her big protector?",
        "Harley: Okay, obviously there are some things that you need to get off your chest. Go ahead. Just make it quick.",

        "Blake: She's the only person whose tied to all four people.",
        "Harley: It doesn't make sense, Blake.",
        "Blake: No, just hear me out. Okay, Gus enters Spauldingville full-time, right, leaving Eden all alone. She's left behind. How else does she get him back into her universe?",
        "Harley: I don't buy it. First of all, it doesn't fit the M.O. of a serial killer. Second of all, when that girl was drowned, Eden was having a dinner party. She has all these witnesses. Gus saw her himself.",
        "Blake: Well, that's very easy. She hires somebody to do it for her.",
        "Harley: I don't want to hear this anymore. I'm not listening to this anymore. This is me not listening to you anymore. La-la-la la-la-la... See, I can't hear you. La-la-la la-la-la...",
        "Gus: I don't think that's the wedding tune. Is it?",

        "Blake: Oh, gee, look at the time. Okay. Congratulations again.",
        "Harley: Bye. (Laughs)",
        "Blake: And you-- you are one lucky guy.",
        "Gus: Yes, I am. Yes, I know. Thank you for coming. Where were we?",
        "Harley: So do you think that Bill went away satisfied with your plan of protection for Eden?",
        "Gus: You don't want to talk about my sister?",
        "Harley: No, I do.",
        "Gus: No.",
        "Harley: You know I can be curious that way.",
        "Gus: Well, if want information you're going to have to work a little harder than that.",
