        "Jonathan and his new girl Zoe hang out at Farley's. Nate and Jonathan confer about their plan while she is in the bathroom, looking for the earrings. Jonathan covers that they don't know each other when she comes back; Nate flirts with her. Tammy is upset to find the earrings in Sandy's place. She checks with Josh again to see if Sandy really lied about working for him tonight. Sandy is surprised to find her there when he returns; she asks him where he's been and acts very suspicious. He assures her that he's happy to see her there. They go to Farley's. Tammy almost tells Sandy about the earrings but stops. Sandy gets a call, so she goes in by herself. Jonathan sees her and decides to leave. He asks Zoe not to talk to Tammy, but she does anyway. Zoe recognizes the earrings and tells Tammy they are hers. Tammy is shocked. Sandy comes up after Zoe leaves and tells Tammy she has to leave town with Josh. At Cross Creek, Olivia gives Bill a late-father's day gift: a wallet with Emma's picture, binoculars, and a mug that says \"World's Greatest Dad\". Someone watches them and then a big pile of wood falls on Bill. He is woozy but fine. Olivia thinks Alan made the \"accident\" happen because he doesn't want Bill to adopt Emma. She phones Josh, who agrees to come out there and look into it. JOsh threatens Alan that nothing had better happen to Bill or Olivia. JOsh asks Nate to give Reva a message that he's going to Cross Creek, in case he can't find her before he leaves. Nate is happy to look after Reva. Nate tells Sebastian that he arranged for the accident in Cross Creek in order to get Josh out of town. He plans to romance (and hurt) Reva. Jonathan tries to talk him out of it, but Nate ends up physically hurting Jonathan to shut him up.",
        "Gus and Harley try to Dr. Wallace, but the police want to chat with them about the accident. They give their statements. They plan to talk to Dr. Wallace again to find out who killed Phillip. Wallace tries to write Gus a note, but he falls unconscious. Sebastian has the $100,000 check that Alan wrote to Dr. Wallace, so he questions Alan over the phone about how Wallace and Harley are connected. Later, Alan goes to the hospital and threatens Sebastian that he will tell the police that he ran over Wallace, but Alan will deny giving him that order. Sebastian prepares to smother Dr. Wallace with a pillow just as Gus and Harley are about to talk to him."

        "Zo\u00eb: Love your body, hate your name.",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) What's wrong with Sandy?",
        "Zo\u00eb: You look more like a Spike or something.",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs )",
        "Zo\u00eb: You know, sexy, dangerous. Hey, where are my earrings?",
        "Jonathan: Uh-oh.",
        "Zo\u00eb: I must have left them at your apartment.",
        "Jonathan: I don't remember seeing them there.",
        "Zo\u00eb: You know what? Maybe the Ladies' Room. Be right back.",
        "Jonathan: What the...?",
        "Nate: You having fun?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah.",
        "Nate: Did you forget you've got a job to do?",
        "Jonathan: No, I didn't. I'm supposed to hurt someone in Reva's family, right?",
        "Nate: Yeah. And that girl's got nothing to do with the Lewis family.",
        "Jonathan: No. She's my sword, man. A sword right through cousin Tammy's little heart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I don't believe this. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Josh: Josh Lewis.",
        "Tammy: Uncle Josh.",
        "Josh: Tammy. Everything okay?",
        "Tammy: I don't know. I know I asked you earlier, but are you sure you didn't send Sandy out on an errand for Lewis?",
        "Josh: No, I didn't, darling. Why? What's happened?",
        "Tammy: Nothing. I'm just having trouble tracking him down.",
        "Josh: Well, I wouldn't worry about it, okay? Wherever Sandy is right now, I guarantee he's only thinking about getting back to you.",
        "Tammy: Yeah. Thanks, Uncle Josh.",
        "Sandy: Tammy. This is a surprise.",
        "Tammy: I bet. Where were you?",
        "Sandy: I told you, I was delivering files.",
        "Tammy: Files. Right. Well, did they reach their destination? Or were you unexpectedly sidetracked?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: So it's basically an exact replica of Josh and Reva's room with a few changes.",
        "Olivia: My man in work clothes. Me like. ( Gasps )",
        "Bill: Whoa.",
        "Worker Two: Sorry.",
        "Bill: It's all right. My fault, my fault, my fault.",
        "Olivia: Are you all right?",
        "Bill: I don't know. It was close. I saw my life flash before my eyes, but you'd better kiss me to... yes, I think everything's still intact and working just fine. See, now, that's why I didn't want Emma coming here and I wanted her to stay at the hotel for a while. It's not the safest place for a little girl to be.",
        "Olivia: Well, see, if the family eats sawdust... I mean,",
        "Olivia: Well, see, if Emma eats sawdust... I mean, not that she would, Mommy would be here to help her. If Alan gets hold of her, then it's a whole other story.",
        "Bill: But you know what? That's all going to change in a few days. Because I will legally be her father. So what can Alan do, huh?",
        "Olivia: Not a good idea to ask questions like that.",
        "Bill: Well, how about this question? Hm?",
        "Olivia: I know how to do that.",
        "Bill: You can? Go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Come on, Sebastian. Out with it. What do you have to say?",
        "Sebastian: Seems there's a connection between a certain man you wanted me to take care of and our favorite little fugitive, Harley Cooper. A rather large connection.",
        "Alan: You don't say.",
        "Sebastian: Oh, I do say, Alan. It's a real puzzler, so I don't know, maybe you could help clear it up for me. What do Gus and Harley hope to learn from Dr. Wallace?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: You know we're taking a big risk coming here, right?",
        "Harley: Well, the way my luck's been this past year, don't you think I deserve some payback?",
        "Gus: It's a good point.",
        "Harley: So, Wallace is an ER doc at Cedars? I'm not sure what that means, but I'll tell you, Cedars is right across the street from Company. I think he saw something that night.",
        "Gus: Yeah. Well, I'm thinking if he knows who killed Phillip, why doesn't he just come out and say it? I don't understand.",
        "Harley: Because he must be afraid of something.",
        "Gus: Or someone.",
        "Harley: Or someone.",
        "Gus: Someone tried to run him down in a yellow taxi cab. That person could still be around.",
        "Harley: Mm-hmm.",
        "Nurse: Did you talk to him yet?",
        "Gus: Who?",
        "Gus and Harley: Dr. Wallace?",
        "Nurse: He just woke up. He's anxious to speak to you.",
        "Harley: Oh, my God. He's awake?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: Nice work, Johnny.",
        "Jonathan: I didn't do it. Sandy did.",
        "Nate: Your good friend Sandy. But you picked her up anyway, didn't you?",
        "Jonathan: No. Sandy did. Tammy Winslow's Mr. Perfect. Not so perfect now, is he? Sandy had this coming for a long time.",
        "Nate: You do know it's the girl you want to hurt, right?",
        "Jonathan: Two for the price of one.",
        "Nate: Oh. And why are you so angry at little Tammy?",
        "Jonathan: Tammy, like everybody else in this town, thinks I'm a piece of dirt and has no problem telling me that over and over again.",
        "Nate: You can't let them do that to you, son. Once they know they can get to you, make you feel like less, they've got no problem putting on their high- heeled pumps and walking all over you every single chance they get. You ought to keep them in their place, son.",
        "Jonathan: That's what I'm doing. Matter of fact, I'll show you, too. You think I've gone soft? Keep watching.",
        "Nate: Who's my boy? Hey? You make me proud.",
        "Zo\u00eb: My earrings weren't in... Hi.",
        "Nate: Hello.",
        "Zo\u00eb: Who's your friend?",
        "Nate: No, I don't know him.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. He just came up and asked me for the time.",
        "Nate: It's amazing how it flies when you're having fun, isn't it?",
        "Jonathan: That's right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Did I forget something? A date? Anniversary? Your birthday? Because you're giving me that look.",
        "Tammy: What look?",
        "Sandy: The \"You did something wrong and you're going to have to figure it out for yourself\" look.",
        "Tammy: No, I'm not. I'm... I am not.",
        "Sandy: Okay, okay. Something's going on here and you're not telling me. Wait. Let's start over. Hi, Beautiful. I'm so glad you're here. I mean it. I really missed you.",
        "Tammy: I'm sorry if I sounded... I should have called first.",
        "Sandy: No, not necessary. Seeing you here when I walk in the door is the best thing in the world.",
        "Tammy: Is it?",
        "Sandy: Of course it is. I was just a little thrown earlier-- in a good way.",
        "Tammy: I guess I was just curious as to where you were.",
        "Sandy: I'm so hungry. You want to go to Farleys? Let's go to Farleys. I'll even let you win at pool.",
        "Tammy: Sure. It'll be fun. Just you and me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: You know what? Maybe I should get back outside, check on our bedrooms. I'm not so sure I like the hardware on the closets, you know?",
        "Olivia: Attention to detail. I like that in a man.",
        "Bill: You do, do you?",
        "Olivia: Mm-hmm.",
        "Bill: Well, tell me, what else do you like, huh?",
        "Olivia: Well, I find you very...",
        "Bill: Sexy?",
        "Olivia: Yes.",
        "Bill: Handsome?",
        "Olivia: Yes.",
        "Bill: Probably a good bowler, a great cook, great sense of humor.",
        "Olivia: I was going to say paternal. Paternal.",
        "Bill: Paternal?",
        "Olivia: Paternal.",
        "Bill: That's lame.",
        "Olivia: No, it's not lame.",
        "Bill: That is lame. It is a little.",
        "Olivia: It is not. It's a good thing. You're going to be a great father.",
        "Bill: A father? Well, I've got to tell you, I like the sound of that.",
        "Olivia: Emma's a lucky girl, and so am I.",
        "Bill: You mean I get presents on top of you Two? This is unbelievable. This is unbelievable.",
        "Olivia: It's a late father's day gift.",
        "Bill: Let's see. What have we got here? Well, we've got a wallet. Let me see. But there's no cash in here, hon.",
        "Olivia: No, you've got... look at the picture of your beautiful little baby girl.",
        "Bill: Oh, she is beautiful.",
        "Olivia: Come on. You need bragging rights when you hang out with the guys.",
        "Bill: She's beautiful, she is. She is. She really is. What else do we have here? Oh, let me see. Oh, binoculars. Yes, yes, yes. I'm going to need these when I'm looking at, you know, insects and birds.",
        "Olivia: No, no. That's for watching your daughter on the playground when she's with the boys.",
        "Bill: No. No, no, no. That is not going to happen until she's 30 years old, all right?",
        "Olivia: ( Laughs )",
        "Bill: She's going to find a nice boy and marry him.",
        "Olivia: Oh, yeah. Who's going to pick out the guy?",
        "Bill: I will, okay? What else have you got?",
        "Olivia: Emma picked that out. She pointed to it in the store.",
        "Bill: She really picked this out? She did?",
        "Olivia: Uh-huh. Because she loves you.",
        "Bill: Well, right back at her, you know?",
        "Olivia: I know. I know you do. I can see it in your eyes when you look at her.",
        "Bill: You can see it in my eyes? Can you see it when I look at you?",
        "Olivia: Oh, I see it. I see it. We love you, too. Happy Father's Day.",
        "Olivia: Yes. ( Laughs )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: I really don't like to be played, Alan. Now, I was asking you about the connection between Wallace and Harley. I kind of doubt that they get together to play cards so, you know, naturally I'm curious.",
        "Alan: Usually I encourage curiosity in my employees, but I think you should finish this mission before you ponder any more questions. Unfinished business can be dangerous, Sebastian.",
        "Sebastian: Dangerous for you, maybe, Alan. I mean, that's just my best guess because I can't know for sure when I'm operating in the dark.",
        "Alan: Just finish the job and then we'll talk.",
        "Sebastian: ( Sighs ) you know, Alan, I take my work very seriously and I would hate to make a mistake because I'm only operating on half the facts. Now, this job could end with results that you hadn't counted on, and you don't want that, now, do you?",
        "Josh: We need to talk, Alan.",
        "Alan: Josh, I'm on the phone.",
        "Josh: Actually, you're not.",
        "Alan: Give me my phone.",
        "Josh: Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. Not until we've had a chance to talk.",

        "Harley: Dr. Wallace?",
        "Gus: Dr. Wallace, you remember us, right?",
        "Harley: From the accident?",
        "Wallace: ( Coughs ) Yes.",
        "Gus: Dr. Wallace, you're like our last hope, our last chance to clear Harley of murder, a murder she didn't commit. She's lost her life and her kids, and... do you think you could help us out?",
        "Harley: Does that mean that you know who shot Phillip?",
        "Wallace: I... I sent the... ( Coughs )",
        "Gus: You sent the messages. Yeah, we know.",
        "Harley: We know, we know. Listen, we know this is hard for you, so you take it easy. You go as slow as you need to go, but please, please give us a name.",
        "Nurse: They're the Two you're looking for.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: Can I buy you Two kids a drink?",
        "Zo\u00eb: Sure.",
        "Jonathan: No, thanks.",
        "Nate: Smart boy. He wants you for himself. For all he knows, you have a weakness for sophisticated older men.",
        "Zo\u00eb: I'm open-minded.",
        "Nate: ( Laughs ) Good girl.",
        "Zo\u00eb: ( Giggles )",
        "Jonathan: Back off, man.",
        "Nate: Oh, he's the jealous type.",
        "Zo\u00eb: Isn't he cute?",
        "Nate: As long as you think so, Angel. Relax, Toddler, she's all yours. I've got to go. You keep that open mind, young lady.",
        "Zo\u00eb: Wow. Two hot guys fighting over me? This is a good day.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, well don't make a big deal out of it.",
        "Zo\u00eb: And you were all cute and protective.",
        "Jonathan: Whatever.",
        "Zo\u00eb: Why don't we go back to your place and look for my earrings?",
        "Jonathan: I'm doing fine just here.",
        "Zo\u00eb: Come on, Sandy.",
        "Jonathan: I'll tell you what. If I find them, I'll give you a call.",
        "Zo\u00eb: Hello. Do I have to hire a skywriter? The earrings were an excuse to get you alone for a little while. Come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: You coming?",
        "Tammy: Yeah.",
        "Sandy: Is something wrong?",
        "Tammy: I found something.",
        "Sandy: What?",
        "Tammy: Doesn't matter. I'll tell you about it later. Let's just go in and get a drink.",
        "Olivia: Mommy and Daddy are going to see you very soon, sweetie. Okay? We love you, too. This is so perfect.",
        "Bill: ( Groaning )",
        "Olivia: Oh, my God. Bill. Bill. Help! Somebody help us! Help! Are you...",
        "Worker Two: What happened?",
        "Olivia: I don't know. We need help. He needs help. Please.",
        "Bill: ( Groaning ) Olivia.",
        "Olivia: Are you okay?",
        "Bill: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Olivia: Can you move?",
        "Bill: Yeah, yeah. Now, all right, who wanted my sandwich and chips?",
        "Olivia: Stop it. That's not funny, all right?",
        "Bill: Which one of you...",
        "Olivia: You need a doctor.",
        "Bill: I'm fine. I'm fine. Really, I am. I'm good. I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.",
        "Olivia: Let's get him inside.",
        "Bill: Yes, really, I guess I can... I'm fine.",
        "Olivia: Just get him on the couch, okay?",
        "Bill: I'm good, you guys.",
        "Olivia: Come on, sit down.",
        "Bill: You're not going to get paid extra.",

        "Bill: Easy on them, Olivia. Please just go easy.",
        "Worker Two: Pete, I stacked those three feet from the edge.",
        "Worker One: Then how did they fall?",
        "Worker Two: Someone would have had to have moved them. It just doesn't make sense.",
        "Olivia: Or maybe it makes perfect sense.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: I've just been asked to testify in an adoption hearing on behalf of my nephew, Bill. Now, Bill has asked for my help, see, and I feel the best way that I can help him is to talk to my good old friend, my pal, Alan Spaulding. I understand that you're not too happy about the idea of Bill adopting Olivia's daughter, Emma.",
        "Alan: Phillip's daughter, Emma. And I don't have time for this conversation.",
        "Josh: You see, Alan, I know very well what you're capable of when you're not happy, so I just want to say this. If something happens, anything at all, that causes a problem for Bill in this adoption process, I'm going to hold one person responsible and that's going to be you.",
        "Alan: Are you finished? I am.",
        "Josh: Just consider yourself warned, Alan. Do not mess with Bill or I'll show you a side of Lewis you've never seen before.",
        "Alan: I'll handle this myself. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Josh: Hello?",
        "Olivia: Hey, Josh, it's Olivia. I'm at Cross Creek with Bill.",
        "Josh: How's the renovation coming?",
        "Olivia: Well, it was going pretty well until Bill got hurt.",
        "Josh: Hurt? How bad?",
        "Olivia: Well, he's okay, but it could have been serious.",
        "Josh: Really?",
        "Olivia: Here's the thing. I... something weird is happening, okay? I don't think it was an accident.",

        "Cop Two: No.",
        "Harley: I am not going down for this. Seconds before I find out who really killed Phillip. I'll make a break for it.",
        "Gus: You're not doing anything.",
        "Harley: Go back into Wallace's room...",
        "Gus: We're not going to let some beat cop outsmart us.",
        "Harley: I'm not outsmarting. I'm not. I'm a convicted killer. I'm a fugitive. They're going to figure it out.",
        "Gus: It was an accident. Listen, it was an accident. It was an accident. The bus turned over. You saw me with a gun in your face and I had to take you with me because I'm in love with you and I went crazy like that. Okay?",
        "Harley: Honey, that's really great and it's very romantic, but it doesn't really explain the whole \"Why I killed Phillip\" thing.",
        "Gus: Just let me do the talking, okay?",
        "Cop Two: Okay, did you get a license plate number?",
        "Gus: License...",
        "Cop Two: You were a witness to a hit and run, right?",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: Yeah. Absolutely. We were. We saw it. We saw everything. We were right there the whole...",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: ...Time. It was terrible. That's all you need from us?",
        "Cop One: Well, what else would we need?",
        "Gus: Uh...",
        "Harley: I don't know. I mean, we're just obviously not ourselves. I'm still in shock.",
        "Gus: It's scary to see something like that. And this poor guy looks like death warmed over.",
        "Cop One: I heard he'd be dead if it weren't for you two.",
        "Gus: You know, just doing our civic duty.",
        "Harley: Absolutely. That's absolutely what that...",
        "Gus: My wife. She's got such a big heart. She's got the biggest heart of anybody I've ever met. Don't you, Sweetheart? Hmm? Very kind, kind-hearted. Every day of my life, I thank God she's still with me. Every single day.",
        "Gus: I'm so sorry. Somebody's medicine. I'm so stupid. I'm sorry. Sorry. Thank you. That's why they don't yell at me.",
        "Harley: I just realized, my favorite soap is on right now.",
        "Gus: Honey Bunny, we don't have time for watching stuff like that.",
        "Harley: Oh, no. I know that we don't. But, you know, I just love that show. I mean...",
        "Gus: Well, I'll... you... you know what?",
        "Harley: I feel like I live with the people in \"Love of Light.\"",
        "Gus: Makes you happy. You watch it. I know you love this show.",
        "Harley: I will.",
        "Gus: Anyway... she likes that stuff. About the accident, yeah. The license plate, no, we didn't get to catch it. It was all happening so fast. I mean, one minute Dr. Wallace was standing there, next thing you know, he's laid out on the ground. He was hit by a... it was a Yellow Cab. It was an older male and it was a male driver. But I've got to tell you, it was kind of so far way we couldn't tell if the guy was 15 or 50, you know? I'm sorry.",
        "Cop Two: Okay. We'll write this up and once you sign, we're finished.",
        "Gus: Okay. Okay, thanks.",
        "Harley: Let's go see Wallace.",

        "Sebastian: I'm sorry that you took what I said as a threat, Alan. Maybe I didn't make myself clear.",
        "Alan: Oh, you've made yourself very clear. Now let me make myself clear. I asked you to go talk to a man. Now, imagine my shock and surprise when I discovered that you ran over him with a taxi cab. What would the police say? Who would they blame? Do you understand?",
