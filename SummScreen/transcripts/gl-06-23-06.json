        "Josh: Hey...",
        "Reva: Hey.",
        "Josh: I'm sorry, do I know you? ( Laughs ) Morning, beautiful.",
        "Reva: I didn't hear you come in.",
        "Josh: Well, I did my best to not wake you up. You were just peaceful and dreaming.",
        "Reva: You worked late.",
        "Josh: Yes. And today's going to be busy, too.",
        "Reva: I'll go grab you some coffee.",
        "Josh: Hang on, hang on. It's not going to be that busy. Oh, I'm sorry. What is this?",
        "Reva: It's...",
        "Josh: \"10 things I want to do before I die\"?",
        "Reva: Yeah, I just, I found it in a box full of old stuff. I probably wrote it when I was 14 or 15.",
        "Josh: Well, that's very sweet. ( Laughs ) You want to knock off a few of these?",
        "Reva: Yeah. But not with you. I... there's just some things I need to do by myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Hey, do I smell biscuits and gravy?",
        "Cassie: ( Laughs ) Sorry, cowboy. Only thing on this ranch is pop tarts and apple juice.",
        "Billy: Oh, well, they don't make cowgirls like they used to, do they?",
        "Cassie: Hey, this cowgirl grew up in Chicago, okay?",
        "Billy: All right.",
        "Cassie: But if you're lucky, if I spend enough time in Oklahoma, there could be biscuits and gravy in your future.",
        "Billy: Oh, you're going to go to Oklahoma?",
        "Cassie: You bet I am. Yes. I was thinking that you're right. I've been leaning on Josh too much, and the only solution is to spend more time in Tulsa and less time...",
        "Billy: Ah, I understand. Thanks.",
        "Cassie: One thing for sure, though, is that Josh and Reva are more in love with each other than they ever have been. And that's as it should be, Billy. 'Til death do them part.",
        "Billy: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: What? What did I say?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Ugh, Alan, coming here was a terrible idea. Why bring Lizzie back to the scene of the crime?",
        "Alan: Beth, she can handle it. I realize she's in a lot of pain right now, but I think that...",
        "Lizzie: Hi, mom! Hi, granddad! Oh, it's a beautiful day outside, isn't it?",
        "Beth: Is it?",
        "Lizzie: Well, yeah. The sun is shining, the birds are singing and I can't think of one reason not to be happy. Besides, today is the first day of the rest of my life with the man that I love, Henry Cooper Bradshaw.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: The padlocks are off the door? Are you sure? Wow. D.A. Doris says she's going to lock us up for life, I... hey, I'm not complaining. Yeah, we're back in business. So if somebody shows up, you turn the lights on and start pouring, okay? All right, I'll be there as soon as I can. Things are starting to look up. You want to talk? I'm up for that.",
        "Tammy: Hey, I'm here. Got here as soon...",
        "Jonathan: Hey.",
        "Tammy: Hey. So what's wrong?",
        "Jonathan: Nothing. Not anymore. Come here.",
        "Tammy: What's the emergency, Jonathan? I told you I needed so time.",
        "Jonathan: And was giving it to you, until I got your note... \"I want to talk, let's meet\"? So...",
        "Tammy: I didn't send this.",
        "Jonathan: Then who did?",
        "Tammy: Maybe it's the same person that sent me this?",
        "Jonathan: \"Tammy, Jonathan needs you, please help him. He's waiting for you at the lighthouse\"?",
        "Tammy: Reva. She did this...",
        "Jonathan: No way.",
        "Tammy: Of course she did. It's just like her to play cupid.",
        "Jonathan: No, believe me. Whoever sent the notes, it wasn't Reva. She's got enough on her plate now with...",
        "Tammy: With what?",
        "Jonathan: Look. Who cares who sent the notes? Whoever did it knows that we should be together. You know it, too.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan...",
        "Jonathan: Tammy... you and me. You...",
        "Tammy: And me. And Lizzie and the baby.",
        "Jonathan: No. Tammy, look, things are already changing. I just got a call from Outskirts. We're open again. I mean, that's just the beginning. Things are really starting to balance out.",
        "Tammy: I'm really happy for you. I should go.",
        "Jonathan: No, Tammy, wait. Tell me you didn't miss me last night. Tell me you didn't pick up that phone and start to dial like a hundred times. Tell me you didn't lie there and stare at the ceiling and think of me and miss me and want me. Just like I wanted you. Say it, Tammy. Tell me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Am I the only one eating? What's wrong you two?",
        "Alan: Um... Elizabeth, I think your mother and I are concerned that you may be covering up your feelings.",
        "Beth: Yes, honey, it's okay to let it out. Of course you're grieving. Your wedding collapsed, all your plans, your dreams...",
        "Lizzie: Mom...",
        "Beth: You can scream if you want to. You can cry. Losing Coop was devastating.",
        "Lizzie: I didn't lose him. I mean, yeah, the wedding didn't go exactly how I would have wanted it to, and... I mean, it hurt, but... I don't know, maybe I'm in shock or something, but I don't see any reason to keep wallowing. I was so glad when I got your call. Actually, it reminded me of something that you taught me. You always told me when you fall off the bicycle, you pick yourself up and you keep going.",
        "Alan: You know, Elizabeth, I think it's very important that you focus on your baby right now.",
        "Lizzie: And just forget Coop and how much I need him?",
        "Beth: Honey, we want you to be happy.",
        "Alan: Yes, but you cannot go around chasing after someone who is not interested in you.",
        "Lizzie: No!",
        "Alan: Especially a Cooper.",
        "Lizzie: You're wrong! Coop does love me. I know that. You know what, he's just angry because I kept that... you know, a little bit of the truth from him. He's going to forgive me. He will. Look, Henry is going to forget what happened, he's going to come back to me and little Jenna.",
        "Beth: Honey, honey, you need to forget this. Now, the baby is what we have to focus on. The baby is not Coop's.",
        "Lizzie: You know something? Coop is my future and my baby's future, and that is the way that I want it. I want it that way, I need it that way, I am going to have it that way. Now what are you doing, Granddad, to help me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I would have thought you'd be thrilled that I'm taking your advice and putting some distance between me and Josh.",
        "Billy: I am, I just... I'm really glad you see it that clearly, you know? I was just thinking about me and Reva and how my feelings have kind of gotten in the way, and I couldn't really, you know, see what was right there down in the bone. You know, some things you just can't do anything about, like... death and taxes.",
        "Cassie: Like Josh and Reva.",
        "Billy: Yeah, well, I think their love is so contagious that we just got kind of caught up in it.",
        "Cassie: Well, my fever has broken. I'm feeling more myself, and it's freed up some energy.",
        "Billy: That's good news.",
        "Cassie: It is good news. In fact, I'm not only going to be spending more time in Tulsa, I'm going to get back into business right here in town.",
        "Billy: What kind of business?",
        "Cassie: Hotel management.",
        "Billy: Yeah?",
        "Cassie: It's what I know. ( Laughs ) What else?",
        "Billy: Okay.",
        "Cassie: I actually have a meeting today at Towers with the general manager.",
        "Billy: Well, hey, I'd better get out of your way.",
        "Cassie: Take your time. Enjoy your coffee. I think I've got an hour.",
        "Billy: No, actually, I'm... I'm heading down to the hospital. I've got to see somebody I promised to drop a visit by.",
        "Cassie: Must be a really good friend, because I know how you hate hospitals.",
        "Billy: Yeah, yeah, you're right. But no, this is a favor that's long overdue.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: So am I missing something here?",
        "Reva: Oh, no, no. This is... this is my problem, really. I mean, I just found that list and it... it upset me a little.",
        "Josh: A little?",
        "Reva: Yeah, you know, seeing it all spelled out. All these things that I wanted to do and never really got done. So I've decided that I'm going to stop putting things off. I'm going to start taking care of everything on that list today.",
        "Josh: You mean, today after the meeting, today, right?",
        "Reva: What meeting?",
        "Josh: What...? ( Laughs ) With Jeffrey O'Neill, Reva. We... you know, he's quite possibly going to be the next mayor of Springfield after the election. We have a lunch meeting with him at Towers.",
        "Reva: You know, you don't need me to sit down with Jeffrey O'Neill. I mean, the sooner I can take care of these things...",
        "Josh: You're going to miss another meeting? I see. How am I not... ( laughs ) Why... why are you pushing me away again, Reva?",
        "Reva: I... I'm not. That's... that's not true, not at all. I mean, every... every choice I've made, everything I've done, everything I've said has been to keep us together in spite of...",
        "Josh: In spite of what, exactly? Are you having second thoughts?",
        "Reva: No! No!",
        "Josh: That I need to know about...?",
        "Reva: No, sweetie, no. No doubts. Never again, I mean, when we tore up those divorce papers and sent them flying, I sent all those crazy thoughts along with them. You are everything to me.",
        "Josh: Okay. Okay. If that's true, then... forget about the list, okay? Just... just for now, and come away with me today. Live... live in the present, Reva. With me. You don't... you don't need to climb the Alps. You want memories that will last you a lifetime, that you'll never forget? We can do that. Come with me, we'll do those things together. We'll have more fun than you can possibly imagine, I promise you that. Just... what do you say? ( Cell phone rings ) No, Reva...",
        "Reva: I have to get that.",
        "Josh: No, actually, you don't have to get that, just...",
        "Reva: I don't... it won't take long. Hi there.",
        "Billy: Hey darling, it's chemo time. You want me to pick you up, or do you want me to just meet you down at the hospital?",
        "Reva: I'm still here.",
        "Billy: You're not thinking about backing out on me, are you?",
        "Josh: Reva, Reva. You know what, just...whoever it is, just tell them that you'll call them back, okay? Please.",
        "Reva: Listen... can I get back to you, Billy?",
        "Josh: Billy?",
        "Billy: Hey, you know, I gave up my golf game this morning so that I could make happy hour with you. Now you're not thinking of canceling on me, are you?",
        "Josh: Reva, Reva, just... just tell him you're busy, okay? You want to go drive race cars? We can do that. You have the right brother right here, right now.",
        "Billy: You still there, darling?",
        "Reva: Billy... I'll see you in a little bit.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Billy, I thought you were off to see that sick friend of yours.",
        "Billy: Oh, you know, I had him on the phone here, and you know, I'm going to go down to that hospital, and I'm going to see him through this, even if it kills him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: You and my brother are going to go drive race cars together, Reva?",
        "Reva: Just please try to understand...",
        "Josh: No, I'm sorry. You know what? That well is dry. You... go. Both of you. Have a great time together. I'll give Jeffrey your best. Have fun.",
        "Reva: Please don't... don't act like that. It's not that...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Sweetheart. Have I ever let you down? Well, not intentionally.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, then what are you saying? Are you saying that you're going to help me get Coop back?",
        "Alan: First things first. Now, you take care of your baby, and I will take care of everything else.",
        "Lizzie: Meaning Coop.",
        "Alan: Meaning I will take care of everything. Your baby will have a perfect life, sweetheart. Now, if you ladies will excuse me.",
        "Beth: Okay, well, you see. You... you feel better now?",
        "Lizzie: Why should I? All that did was prove that you and granddad care more about the baby than me.",
        "Beth: That is not true.",
        "Lizzie: It doesn't even matter anymore.",
        "Beth: Honey. You are my little girl. We are in this together.",
        "Lizzie: Then why is it that I feel all alone?",
        "Beth: Honey, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry. Forgive me. And I know, I know you've been through so much, but you can't forget how lucky you are.",
        "Lizzie: Lucky? Mom. It is Jonathan's. Okay, because I don't want you to forget that, because I can't forget that. And if I can't be with Coop, and if I can't raise this baby with him, then there's no reason for either of us to be alive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Do I want you?",
        "Jonathan: Do you?",
        "Tammy: I'll want you as long as I'm breathing. Did I want to call you last night? Did I lie awake thinking about you, and dream about you?",
        "Jonathan: Well, that's all I need to hear. Look, all the rest of it, nothing else matters.",
        "Tammy: No, you're wrong.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy...",
        "Tammy: Other stuff does matter, Jonathan. I admitted it to you, I... I faced the truth. You're not the only onto blame, I made mistakes too.",
        "Jonathan: No, who cares? Let's drop it. Let's drop all the blame. All that matters is us and what we have together.",
        "Tammy: It's not that simple.",
        "Jonathan: Look at us. Up here. Me and you, looking down on everything. Making it seem small.",
        "Tammy: How did we get here?",
        "Jonathan: Who cares? Who cares who wrote this stupid note? Let's chalk it up to fate.",
        "Tammy: We make our own fate.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. Then how do we fix this thing? It got screwed up. You just tell me how.",
        "Tammy: What I need is a little more time and a little more space.",
        "Jonathan: How much more?",
        "Tammy: I don't know. Just let me be for now.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, Tammy. Tammy.",
        "Alan: She's right, you know. It wasn't fate that brought you together. It was me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim Zimmer, \"Inside The Light.\" Well, I have a lot of fun working with Ricky Paul for sure. We had a couple of scenes early on. I think that they'd have a... I don't know on what level you could... certainly not a romantic level, but there's gold there, I think, with the two of us, and... and I think Reva and Gus could... could make a wonderful, little intriguing couple. See Reva, Wednesday, June 28, \"Inside The Light. \"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: You're my pen pal. Nice penmanship.",
        "Alan: No need to thank me.",
        "Jonathan: No kidding. That's how you get your kicks, old man? You mess with a few lives? Or is this revenge for knocking up your granddaughter? It takes two to dance, gramps.",
        "Alan: Jonathan, I'm aware that my granddaughter made a big mistake in getting involved with you.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, she made a few mistakes. Like telling Coop that baby was his.",
        "Alan: Neither you or Henry Cooper is good enough for my granddaughter, but that's not the point I'm here to make.",
        "Jonathan: Well, what is the point?",
        "Alan: Elizabeth's baby will be well taken care of, and you, my friend, are off the hook.",
        "Jonathan: Is that what Elizabeth wants?",
        "Alan: Why should that matter to you?",
        "Jonathan: It doesn't. Believe me, I think this baby's far better off without me in the picture. And plus, I've got my own stuff to take care of.",
        "Alan: Yes, like bringing business back to the Outskirts bar.",
        "Jonathan: How'd you know about that?",
        "Alan: No one has contributed more to the district attorney's political future than I. You see, we share many of the same concerns.",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) You have Doris Wolfe in your back pocket. You got her to take off those padlocks.",
        "Alan: Yes, and it brought you and Tammy together for a brief encounter.",
        "Jonathan: Uh-huh.",
        "Alan: Yes, that's what guardian angels do.",
        "Jonathan: Ah. Until the other wing drops.",
        "Alan: No surprises up my arm. Only... Havana cigar. See, I like to share in the finer things of life to my new partner.",
        "Jonathan: I'm not your partner.",
        "Alan: ( Chuckles ) Not yet, Jonathan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Tammy, no. Don't leave, don't move out.",
        "Tammy: Lizzie. Hope I'm not disappointing you, but I'm not leaving.",
        "Lizzie: What are you doing?",
        "Tammy: Taking some time to think things through.",
        "Lizzie: Wow, you have no idea how happy that makes me to hear that. Look, I would have felt awful. This thing with me and Jonathan, it was just some crazy night. Everybody has them, you know, a crazy, stupid night where you're not thinking. I mean, if I was thinking, come on, Tammy... Jonathan? Not my type. Look, and you are my friend, okay? Sometimes I think you're the only real friend I've had. If I do or if we still are friends. Look, it was just... it was a horrible mistake, okay? You just have to believe that.",
        "Tammy: I do.",
        "Lizzie: You do? Why are you leaving, then? I mean... taking a time out.",
        "Tammy: No offense, but what we do and how we handle what happened is our business, not yours.",
        "Lizzie: Great. That's great. Hey, it's more than fine with me. I... oh, God, I'm just glad that you're not blaming me for this.",
        "Tammy: I didn't say that. Oh, there is more than enough blame to go around. There's plenty for Jonathan, there's plenty for everyone. So, if you've said everything you came here to say...",
        "Lizzie: Well, no, not yet.. not everything. It's because we're friends that I know that I can say this to you, and you're going to understand.",
        "Tammy: You sure about that?",
        "Lizzie: Well, you want to be with Jonathan. And I want to be with Coop, right? If we work together, I mean, I can't think of a single reason why we can't both get what we want. First, you have to help me save Coop from Ava.",
        "Tammy: ( Laughs ) Oh!",
        "Lizzie: What is so funny?",
        "Tammy: You didn't come here to apologize for sleeping with my boyfriend. You came here to ask me for a favor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I'm sorry Reva had some conflicts this afternoon.",
        "Josh: Yeah, well, I'm sorry, too. How can I help you?",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, right to business, huh?",
        "Josh: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jeffrey: Actually, Josh, I think we can help one another.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I would love a fresh start right here in Springfield. And you know that I am a perfect fit for Towers. So I'm not taking no for an answer.",
        "Bradley: Who knew you were so persistent?",
        "Cassie: Well, when there's something you want, go after it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Really? I appreciate your support.",
        "Jeffrey: So. When I'm elected mayor, I want Lewis Construction to build us a facility right here in Springfield.",
        "Josh: You mean, if you're elected mayor.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. And if we announce the plans right away and the great jobs that will come along with it, and the care that our brave soldiers in uniform will be getting.",
        "Josh: Yeah, Jeffrey, this project is not a game at all for me, and it certainly is not for sale.",
        "Jeffrey: Josh, you're a smart and capable guy. Okay, I just... we're coming at this from different angles, is all, okay? You seem to be focused on the logic, and I'm going at it one step at a time. But I'm trying to tell you, without the passion, you're going to be dead in the water. Hi.",
        "Cassie: Hi, guys. I've been eavesdropping. Now, Jeffrey, are you really suggesting that Josh lacks passion? Because if you are, you are nuts. Josh is one of the most passionate men I have ever known.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Relax, Reva.",
        "Reva: Yeah, that's easy for you to say. Nurse, excuse me. What is taking so long today?",
        "Nurse: Dr. McCabe's orders. He'd like to speak to you first.",
        "Reva: Why? Well, where is he? I don't have all day!",
        "Billy: Darling, just take a deep breath, okay?",
        "Reva: You know what? Do not \"deep breath\" me, Billy.",
        "Colin: Hello, everyone.",
        "Reva: Well, there he is. Down from the mount. Who do I have to sleep with to get a round of chemo?",
        "Billy: You'd better give her that treatment, she's really riled up.",
        "Reva: So what's up, Doc? ( Laughs ) You want to double my dosage? Hell, why don't you triple it? You can start taking bets, you know, on what's going to fall out next. My teeth, my toenails. Not in the mood for joking today, huh?",
        "Colin: You want to sit, Reva?",
        "Reva: No, why?",
        "Billy: Either you've got a great poker face, or that's, uh...",
        "Colin: These are your latest results. And the numbers confirm... what I, um...",
        "Billy: What you what?",
        "Colin: What I thought was the case, I'm afraid.",
        "Reva: Which is?",
        "Colin: Reva, I'm sorry. The chemo's not working. Your cancer is spreading.",

        "Jonathan: So what's next, big Al? ( Laughs ) You going to give me a V.P. job at Spaulding, or maybe my own room at the mansion? What do you got next?",
        "Alan: ( Laughs ) No, no, I don't want you near the mansion or Elizabeth or Spaulding Enterprises. I don't want you burning down what I've spend a lifetime in building up.",
        "Jonathan: So then... what are you doing? You got my bar opened back up, you have me meet with Tammy. What are you trying to do?",
        "Alan: A few weeks ago, I lost a child, Jonathan. A son. And the feelings I went through at that time, something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. I not only lost a child, I lost my last chance.",
        "Jonathan: Last chance for what?",
        "Alan: Redemption.",
        "Jonathan: Good luck with that.",
        "Alan: Good luck to both of us. Because if there is a man less suited to be a father than I, it's you, my friend.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, you don't see me arguing. I don't want anything to do with that baby. I don't like Lizzie. I don't want to play daddy. So... what? What are you offering me?",
        "Alan: The one thing you want most in your life. The one thing you're afraid of losing: Tammy Winslow.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Okay, you have me all wrong, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: Lizzie, you are predictable and pathetic. Poor Lizzie shows up here with a tear in her eye, saying \"Please, please forgive me... because I need a favor.\" Ugh! It's classic.",
        "Lizzie: It's true, okay! I... I feel awful. You think I'm not sorry that I slept with Jonathan? You think I'm happy that I'm pregnant with his baby?",
        "Tammy: There is one good thing that can come out of this whole mess. One. And that's that baby. Jonathan's baby. Who knows, maybe one day she'll change everything. At least change you.",
        "Lizzie: I don't want to change. I mean, I am who I am, okay? I mean, love me, you have to love my shoes and my clothes and my household staff. Actually, Coop did love me for who I am. And he would still be loving me right now, but Ava sunk her nasty little unmanicured claws right into him.",
        "Tammy: That's right. Blame Ava.",
        "Lizzie: You bet I do. She's ruining your life, too, Tammy. Can't you see that? If she hadn't went after Coop, we would be married by now and what happened with Jonathan would have never happened. If you can just help me get rid of her...",
        "Tammy: For once in your selfish life, stop blaming everyone else. Lizzie, you did this. And I take it back. I feel sorry for that baby. Because no child should be stuck with a mother like you.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, stop.",
        "Tammy: You deserve everything that you get. I've been your friend. I have supported you through all of this!",
        "Lizzie: Just wait... um... I...",
        "Tammy: What?",
        "Lizzie: Hold on... I don't feel good. I think there's something wrong.",

        "Jeffrey: Excuse us.",
        "Cassie: Right this way, Mr. Mayor.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. What's this all about?",
        "Cassie: Just bear with me. It's a visual aid here. Take a look. Look. You see the one building that stands out from the rest? You know who built that?",
        "Jeffrey: Sorry, no idea.",
        "Cassie: Lewis Construction. And not just out of steel and glass and concrete, but out of heart and soul. It is passion that Lewis Construction is built on, Jeffrey. It's in everything we do.",
        "Jeffrey: We?",
        "Cassie: That's right, we. Because it is a family business. It is my family. And if you respect quality and vision and expertise, then you will back this project because it is based on all the things that we at Lewis Construction believe in. And passion, and commitment, and caring. And you will back it not just because of what standing behind it will do for your standing politically.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, okay. Yeah, sure. I mean, I agree with you.",
        "Cassie: You do?",
        "Jeffrey: 100%.",
        "Josh: Great. Then we have a deal. Not quite a full endorsement, but Lewis will definitely back you on your plans to build a veterans' center here in Springfield. Does that work for you?",
        "Jeffrey: I guess it's going to have to.",
        "Josh: Excellent. We shake on it, and it's a done deal.",
        "Cassie: Ooh, wow, hold on. I have to get a picture of this. For... I don't know. Posterity... the front page, a few pamphlets, maybe?",
        "Josh: Oh, okay.",
        "Jeffrey: All right, well listen, so I'll let you know when I arrange the press conference, and I want you both there.",
        "Josh: No problem.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay? To make it official.",
        "Josh: Okay. That was a lovely speech, thank you.",
        "Cassie: Well, I... I meant every word of it, Josh. I just... you know, I've tried staying at home and watching from the sidelines. It doesn't work for me. I'm not going to watch anymore. And I think Jeffrey was right, don't you?",
        "Josh: About what?",
        "Cassie: Without passion, we might just as well be dead.",
        "Josh: Absolutely.",

        "Reva: You know what, Billy, just stop, okay? Let me talk to Dr. McCabe alone?",
        "Billy: You sure? All right, I'll be right outside if you need me.",
        "Reva: I know. So, there's no mistake?",
        "Colin: No mistake.",
        "Reva: Okay, so... what do we do? Another lumpectomy?",
        "Colin: Well, I think it's in the lymph nodes.",
        "Reva: Okay, so we take the lymph nodes out, and then we test them, and then...",
        "Colin: Well, yes, but...",
        "Reva: Oh, you know what... ( laughs ) Now is not the time for you to all of a sudden become evasive with me, Dr. McCabe. Where is that famous bluntness I've gotten to know and hate?",
        "Colin: Look, I've been playing with you, Reva. Chemotherapy, protocol, looking for the right combination and dosage that would make you respond in the way that we'd hoped.",
        "Reva: Okay, so can you double the dosage?",
        "Colin: Well, that's what I want to talk to you about.",
        "Reva: Okay, good.",
        "Colin: Look, I'm not giving up on conventional means of treatment. With some luck...",
        "Reva: Luck?",
        "Colin: If all goes well, removal of all the affected lymph nodes, continuing to hit it with radiation, will...",
        "Reva: And what if it doesn't go well?",
        "Colin: Cedars is an excellent hospital, but I think I may be able to help you more at another hospital. I used to work at the Langer clinic in Minnesota, and they are performing some very cutting-edge procedures.",
        "Reva: Cutting edge?",
        "Colin: Yeah.",
        "Reva: As in, experimental?",
        "Colin: Well, they're having some success with this one procedure called a stem cell rescue. It basically involves overwhelming your body with both chemotherapy and radiation, a massive dose.",
        "Reva: How massive?",
        "Colin: Well, enough to wipe out every cancer cell in your body. And to wipe out your immune system.",
        "Reva: Completely wipe out?",
        "Colin: This is just a last resort, just something to have in our back pocket.",
        "Reva: That's a hell of a back pocket.",
        "Colin: I think you should think about the Langer clinic. They're just better prepared to handle whatever way your disease progresses.",
        "Reva: So just pack up and move to Minnesota.",
        "Colin: Well, your husband can come with you.",
        "Reva: It's really that bad?",
        "Colin: Do you really have to ask that with the week you've had?",
        "Reva: Thanks, Doc. As always, you have been wonderfully comforting. Billy.",
        "Billy: Reva, you...",
        "Reva: Don't you look at me like that. I'm not dead yet. So what do you say we blow this pop stand, huh?",
        "Billy: Good idea. I'm with you, sweetie. Let's go.",
        "Reva: Thanks.",
        "Billy: Whoa, whoa, okay.",
