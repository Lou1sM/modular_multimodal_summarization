        "Mel: Okay. I have your file right here. Yes, you know, I'm so sorry. We've been really swamped lately, but your case is top of our list.",
        "Harley: You guys are sure busy today.",
        "Mel: Yeah.",
        "Harley: I said you guys sure are busy today.",
        "Mel: All right, what's the address?",
        "Harley: Yeah, I'm kind of busy myself. Went to a yoga class with Cassie, and then I helped her fix something with Edmund, and then went for a drink with Gus. Then we got to talking, and, well, long story short, we're eloping.",
        "Mel: What?",
        "Blake: What are you talking about?",
        "Harley: Eloping. Yeah, that's us. We're going to join the marital circus, so to speak. Isn't that romantic?",
        "Blake: No.",
        "Mel: No!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Oh, Gus.",
        "Gus: How are you?",
        "Alexandra: You have no idea how I'm looking forward to this wedding.",
        "Gus: Right. Well, actually, that's what I have to talk to you about.",
        "Alexandra: I know you're nervous.",
        "Gus: No, I don't have... there's not a nervous bone in my body.",
        "Alexandra: Not to worry. I have everything under control.",
        "Gus: Yeah, I know. You always say that. That's the thing that...",
        "Alexandra: Gus, I realize it's been... well, a rough couple of weeks. I think this wedding can put a lot of that behind us.",
        "Gus: Yeah. Well, it's funny that you think that, because I don't... I don't see that happening.",
        "Alexandra: Well, I do. Besides that, it gives me a chance to repay you for protecting me.",
        "Gus: Yeah, but I didn't do it for you. Can you remember that, please? I did it for Alan; I did it for the family.",
        "Alexandra: Whatever the reasons.",
        "Gus: Alex, do you really think that a big, fancy wedding's going to make me feel better about lying to my future wife?",
        "Alexandra: You know, I actually do.",
        "Gus: You are a piece of work. It doesn't matter anyway, because the wedding's off.",
        "Alexandra: What?",
        "Gus: Yeah. We're eloping. It's just... it's, you know, hassle-free, no headaches. It's better. It's better this way.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, really? Better for whom? Come on, Gus. Gus, you don't want to elope, do you? It's Harley.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Phillip.",
        "Phillip: Olivia.",
        "Olivia: I talked to Beth.",
        "Phillip: Well, if it's about her overseeing Emma's care...",
        "Olivia: It's a great idea.",
        "Phillip: Oh, you like it?",
        "Olivia: Beth has your best interest at heart, which means she has Emma's at heart. And I want that for my daughter.",
        "Phillip: Well, good. The one thing we may actually agree on.",
        "Olivia: You can call off your dogs.",
        "Phillip: The dogs?",
        "Olivia: The little spies you have following me.",
        "Phillip: Oh, those. No, I'm sorry, I can't do that. While we may both want what's best Emma, we have very different ideas about what that is. So, until a judge decides that you'll have to get used to the dogs.",
        "Olivia: You know, Emma's going to grow up one day and realize what animal you are. You will lose her, like you've lost every other woman in your life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Proposal?",
        "Cassie: You know what you need? You need to relax. We both need to relax. So, why don't we sit and take off our shoes. I can help you take off your shoes.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, Cassie, Cassie. You don't... you don't have to do this.",
        "Cassie: I do. I really want you to be in the mood to hear my proposal. I really want you to listen to me.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I'm the one who should be on bended knee, not you. If our situation was different...",
        "Cassie: It wasn't that kind of proposal.",
        "Edmund: Oh. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I felt that.",
        "Cassie: I want to be close to you. God, I do. Edmund, you had a dream. You had a vision. You wanted to make this place a home for me, my boys and Tammy. Tomorrow that dream comes true. I mean isn't that amazing?",
        "Edmund: I'm glad for you, Cassie. RJ is going to love this place and Tammy is going to be riding everyday.",
        "Cassie: Everyone's going to be happy. Everyone except me.",
        "Edmund: Cassie...",
        "Cassie: Edmund, I am not going to be happy here without you.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I can't. I've got to go.",
        "Cassie: Don't say nothing. Just sit. Please. Sit. Stay.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, it is a mistake, for you and for me. And the kids... it's just I don't... mm. Duck a l'orange. Did you make this?",
        "Cassie: I had it made for you.",
        "Edmund: At the beacon.",
        "Cassie: I know it's your favorite, and it goes very nicely with this.",
        "Edmund: Chateau neuf-du-pape.",
        "Cassie: I did mark the box with the wine glasses.",
        "Edmund: Smart move. Thank you. Mm. Well, if this is... if this is farm living, count me in.",
        "Cassie: Is that a yes, Edmund?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, it has to take more than fine wine and French cuisine. Are these zucchini flowers?",
        "Cassie: With fresh mascarpone.",
        "Edmund: Wow. You really don't fight fair do you?",
        "Cassie: Well, you know what they say, all's fair in love and war.",
        "Edmund: Which one is this, Cassie?",
        "Cassie: I love you, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: You just don't trust me.",
        "Cassie: I made a mistake.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, you thought I was a drug dealer.",
        "Cassie: I made a mistake, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Mistake. So what do we do now? We just forgive and forget?",
        "Cassie: Forgive, but don't forget. No. Not any of it. Especially how much we mean to each other.",
        "Edmund: I want to forget all of it, Cassie, because that will just make it a lot easier.",
        "Cassie: Is that what you want, Edmund? Do you want everything to be easy? No risk? No danger? No payoffs?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I risked I risked everything for you.",
        "Cassie: No. Neither of us did. I didn't trust you. But you held back and you expected me to doubt you. But no more. I want to give everything to this, Edmund. I want to give everything to you.",
        "Edmund: How do I know that?",
        "Cassie: You've got to trust me.",
        "Edmund: So I give you what you couldn't give me.",
        "Cassie: You gave us what we both deserved: A second chance.",

        "Harley: You guys don't know the first thing about being romantic. Okay, well, maybe you know something. But hey, one woman's romantic is another woman's...",
        "Blake: Huge mistake.",
        "Harley: I don't think that eloping with Gus is a huge mistake.",
        "Mel: Harley, you only do this once.",
        "Harley: No, Mel, you only do this once.",
        "Mel: Okay. Once with Gus.",
        "Blake: Well, not necessarily.",
        "Harley: Mm-hmm.",
        "Mel: My point is your wedding day is a day you want to remember.",
        "Harley: Yes, but not for the headache you got planning it.",
        "Blake: Oh, honey. There will be no headache here. Do you not realize you have not one, but two angels to help you pull off the wedding of the century?",
        "Harley: Well, you guys need to get in line behind my father and Frank and Alan and Alexandra. My problem is not enough help. It's too much help. All Gus and I want to do is say I do.",
        "Blake: Are you sure?",
        "Harley: Well, you know, I have been really nervous about the thought of getting married again.",
        "Blake: You know are you sure this is what Gus wants?",
        "Harley: My Gus? To elope? This is the man who owns two suits. This is the guy who thinks putting beer in a glass is being fancy.",
        "Mel: All we're saying, Harley, is you've done this before. He hasn't.",
        "Harley: I think I would know if the man I loved wanted this extravaganza that everybody else seems to want to throw for us.",
        "Blake: Men never really tell what they really want.",
        "Harley: I thought that was us.",
        "Blake: They've been watching us.",
        "Harley: So you think that Gus really wants a big, fancy wedding and he won't admit it?",
        "Blake: It wouldn't be the first he's kept something from you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: No, Cooper and I, we both want this. We both want to elope. That's the thing.",
        "Alexandra: Really? Well, you're lucky you're a cop, because you're a lousy liar.",
        "Gus: Really?",
        "Alexandra: Mm-hmm.",
        "Gus: You'd better hope that's not true, Mrs. Godfrey.",
        "Alexandra: Okay, Gus, I don't want to tell you what to do or...",
        "Gus: Yeah, but you are.",
        "Alexandra: Okay, I am. But it's because I care about you.",
        "Gus: Okay. You see what's happening here? You're overcompensating, because you feel guilty that I covered for you and you don't have to go to prison. That's what's happening.",
        "Alexandra: All right, maybe I do. Mm-hmm. Maybe I do, but that doesn't change the fact that we are family now, Gus. And I really do want to make this a special day for you.",
        "Gus: Yeah, but this is... this is, like, pressure. I don't need this kind of pressure.",
        "Alexandra: All right, no pressure. Look, I am safe. You did it. That letter is the last connection between Brad and I. Come on, you don't have to run away. You can stay here. You can enjoy the wedding that you deserve, for heaven's sakes. Don't you want this to be a day you're never going to forget?",
        "Gus: Yes. It's going to be. It will be.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, sure. Yes, indeedy. It's going to be a day you will never forget how you've disappointed your family. Come on, Gus. I mean, a justice of the peace, an Elvis wedding chapel? That's just hunky-dory for some people, but it's not for you. No, family's too important to you. Otherwise I don't think you'd risk so much to protect me.",
        "Gus: Okay, look. Yes, my family is very important to me, okay? But what Harley wants, that's got to count for some... I've got to do what she wants.",
        "Alexandra: Gus, what do you want? You only just found your father. Don't you think he wants to be there to see you marry Harley? What about her father, huh?",
        "Gus: I'm sorry. We're eloping. That's it.",
        "Alexandra: Are you sure?",
        "Gus: Yes, yes. I'm sure. That's it, okay? Please, please. You promise me... just promise me right now you are not going to interfere. Just promise me. Say it.",
        "Alexandra: Okay. Okay. If it's what I think you really want, cross my heart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: Well, I'm far from the perfect father.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, Lizzie's proof of that.",
        "Phillip: I love my children and they love me. It'll be no different with Emma.",
        "Olivia: Well, it might be. I mean, Emma's nothing like Lizzie.",
        "Phillip: She will be. Once she grows up and gets to know her big sister, she'll want to be just like her.",
        "Olivia: Over my dead body.",
        "Phillip: Works for me.",
        "Olivia: I'm not afraid of you, Phillip.",
        "Phillip: You should be.",
        "Olivia: You want to fight? Bring it on. Just remember I give as well as I get.",
        "Phillip: Right. Well, you'll begin by giving me back my stock.",
        "Olivia: Did I not do that yet?",
        "Phillip: It must have slipped your mind.",
        "Olivia: Hmm. Well, I'd love to do it right now, but the fireworks are about to go off, and I don't want to miss them.",
        "Phillip: I thought the fourth of July was next week. There will be no fireworks for a while.",
        "Olivia: It shows you what you know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Well, Josh, drinking in the middle of the afternoon? That's not like you. That's more like me.",
        "Josh: Well, that's why I took the liberty of ordering for you-- club soda with a lime.",
        "Bill: How about a splash of gin, huh? I see. So this is a conversation I should be sober for?",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Bill: Oh. That's fine. I've got a lot of work to do tonight anyway. Did you hear we got that thing going on on Fifth Street? It's going to be huge for us.",
        "Josh: This actually isn't about work, Bill.",
        "Bill: What's going on?",
        "Josh: I had a little talk with Olivia.",
        "Bill: Olivia? What did she want?",
        "Josh: Well, she seems to think that you're not getting over Eden's death as well as you're letting on.",
        "Bill: Is that right?",
        "Josh: She also said you have a gun, which you were thinking about using on somebody, maybe even yourself.",
        "Bill: Unbelievable. Could I get a scotch, please? Thank you.",
        "Josh: I just have one question for you, Bill.",
        "Bill: What, is it true? What, you think I'm so messed up about Eden that I'd actually kill somebody?",
        "Josh: Are you?",
        "Bill: I'll tell you something. Right now there's a prime target in mind.",
        "Josh: Bill...",
        "Bill: Look, Uncle Josh, I'll tell you what's going on here. Olivia came to me with some business proposal. I turned her down. Now this is some sort of lame attempt to get back at me.",
        "Josh: That's not what Tony said.",
        "Bill: Tony? You would believe him?",
        "Josh: Actually, there was nothing to believe. He told me to ask you, and that's what I'm doing right now. I'm asking you. Did you have some purpose in mind for that gun?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: I have been selfish before, but this takes the cake. I mean, I took the flowers, I took the wedding dress, I took the cake, and I threw it right out the window. I am depriving Gus of his one and only chance to have a fabulous wedding. What was I thinking?",
        "Blake: Maybe about all those other times you walked down the aisle.",
        "Mel: Or the miserable marriages that followed.",
        "Harley: Yes, yes. But I should have been thinking of Gus. This is his first time.",
        "Blake: Yeah, you want it to be special.",
        "Harley: He deserves that.",
        "Mel: So do you.",
        "Harley: Yes. So it's settled, then. Elopement off, wedding on!",
        "Mel: Wonderful!",
        "Blake: All right, there's so much to do. All right. We have to figure out the place, right?",
        "Mel: Oh, the courthouse garden, that's nice.",
        "Harley: No, I'd just be copying Blake and Ross' first wedding.",
        "Blake: Oh, why not? We loved it. I'll give you a tip. If you do it at sunset, it won't be too hot.",
        "Mel: Oh, and the dress, the dress. I saw this great place over on Montana.",
        "Blake: Oh, yes. You know what? They're all from Paris.",
        "Mel: Yes.",
        "Blake: They're open late. We could go tonight. Music.",
        "Mel: Music.",
        "Blake: I'm thinking a harp would be so romantic.",
        "Mel: Oh, that's beautiful.",
        "Blake: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Mel: Oh, and I know a guy who does great ice sculptures.",
        "Blake: Oh.",
        "Harley: (Whistles) time out. No, no, no, no, no. No gardens, no harps, no French wedding dresses, no ice sculptures. No, this is simple. This is simple. I... it's going to be me and Gus. It's going to be a few family and friends.",
        "Blake: Are you going to have food?",
        "Harley: We'll do hot dogs and beer at company.",
        "Mel: Oh, no! Are you going to order enough for the Spauldings?",
        "Blake: I could see the look on Alex's face if you give her a hot dog.",
        "Harley: Actually, so can I.",
        "Blake: No, no, no. I can't even image what she would say.",
        "Mel: No, no, no. You have to; have to upgrade the catering at least.",
        "Harley: No. No. This is my wedding. I will do my wedding my way. And I'll tell you something. If that old cow doesn't like it, she can stay home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Moo.",
        "Gus: Well, okay, because you have an ad here that says, \"Wedding package, license, ceremony.\" All you can eat pizza? Uh-huh. Okay. Well, how much is... yeah, right. Of course flowers are extra. I get that. That would... uh-huh. Okay. What's your name? Ziz? How do you... never mind. Okay, look. I'll just... I'll call you back soon, all right? You know, I could see us doing this someday.",
        "Phillip: So I understand those vicious rumors about your bachelor days being over are true.",
        "Gus: Dude, I didn't even hear you slide in here.",
        "Phillip: I'm very good at stealth.",
        "Gus: Yeah. Yeah, I guess that runs in the family, huh?",
        "Phillip: How are you doing? You okay?",
        "Gus: Yeah, I'm good, you know? Things are good.",
        "Phillip: Yeah?",
        "Gus: Thinking of myself, you know? I guess Harley deserves someone a little better than me.",
        "Phillip: Well, of course she does. But you'll have to do.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Phillip: You're getting a good woman.",
        "Gus: Yeah. What about you? Are you getting any?",
        "Phillip: These days?",
        "Gus: Well...",
        "Phillip: No.",
        "Gus: No?",
        "Phillip: Not much.",
        "Gus: Literally or figuratively?",
        "Phillip: Both.",
        "Gus: I see.",
        "Phillip: That's all right. My life is very interesting.",
        "Gus: You deserve to be happy, too, you know? Remember that.",
        "Phillip: Don't worry. I will be. (Phone rings) excuse me.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Phillip: Phillip Spaulding. Marjorie, hey. She did? All of it? Hmm. Well, I don't know what my wife's up to. No, that's great. Just keep me posted, okay? Thanks.",
        "Gus: Olivia monkey business?",
        "Phillip: No, actually she did exactly what I told her to. She returned all of my stock to my account with a healthy profit.",
        "Gus: Hmm. Sounds promising.",
        "Phillip: Yes, it does. But you have to remember with Olivia, nothing is ever exactly what it seems.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: You going to answer my question sometime today?",
        "Bill: Uncle Josh, obviously Olivia's trying to work some sort of angle here. It has nothing to do with her being worried about me.",
        "Josh: You know what? I was married to Olivia. I know all about Olivia. It's you I can't read right now.",
        "Bill: Well, it's easy, Uncle Josh. I work and I play, end of story.",
        "Josh: Lacks depth and honesty.",
        "Bill: Oh, gee, now you're a critic. That's...",
        "Josh: Look, I know you're in pain, Bill, okay? I understand you're not dealing with it well. So maybe a therapist...",
        "Bill: Can shrink someone else's head. Look, Uncle Josh, I appreciate it, but work is my therapy.",
        "Josh: That's not good for you or the business.",
        "Bill: Lewis construction is thriving right now.",
        "Josh: What about you?",
        "Bill: Thriving.",
        "Josh: I know a lot has gone down these last few weeks with Danny and Eden. If you want to talk...",
        "Bill: I'll call. You will be the first person I call. Thank you.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Bill: Tony? Bill. Yeah, let's start demolition on that thing right away, all right? Well, I want to get moving. Are you all set on your end? Good. Well then don't let me down. All right. Talk to you later. What do you want?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: I just saw Josh leave. I hope the two of you had a chance to talk.",
        "Cassie: Meet me halfway, Edmund. Grab my hand. Take a leap of faith with me. If we jump together, we'll both land on our feet.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I don't know. With all of our baggage, we're more likely than not going to crash to the earth like a ton of bricks.",
        "Cassie: Would we be any worse off than we are now?",
        "Edmund: You make this really hard to say no.",
        "Cassie: Say yes.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, how do you do it? How? How do you just sit in the present moment without thinking about the past or the future?",
        "Cassie: Oh, we deal with the past and we face the future, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: But Cassie, how do you get beyond... without trust, getting beyond the suspicions? How do... stay right here. I'm going to take care of it.",
        "Cassie: No, no, no. It's probably a bird. They come in all the time. Look, just... just say here, please, and have another glass of wine. I'll take care of it.",
        "Edmund: Yeah, yeah. Cassie?",
        "Cassie: Oh, my God.",
        "Edmund: What? What?",
        "Cassie: Oh, my God. That was not a bird. That was Dracula!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coming up on \"Guiding Light\"...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You need me.",
        "Bill: Mind games and dirty tricks aren't going to cut it with the boys I'll be doing business with.",
        "Olivia: Boys like Tony Santos? Because if you're climbing into bed with him, you're definitely going to need my help.",
        "Edmund: Dracula's in the next room in the middle of the day. How odd.",
        "Cassie: You're not taking me seriously.",
        "Edmund: Oh, I'm sorry. So perhaps we should offer him a glass of wine.",
        "Cassie: I think our visitor prefers blood, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Okay, you've got me curious. What is that?",
        "Cassie: It's a bat, a bat with big black wings are red beady eyes.",
        "Edmund: A bat?",
        "Cassie: Yes.",
        "Edmund: All this fuss is over a bat? Cassie, we had hundreds of them back in the castle in San Cristobel.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Well, we also had 50-foot ceilings, okay? We weren't in face-to- face combat.",
        "Edmund: Oh, Cassie, this is probably just a harmless little fruit bat.",
        "Cassie: Well, I will leave the species identification up to you.",
        "Edmund: All right, fine. I will identify and eliminate in one fell swoop.",
        "Cassie: Wait a minute. What do you mean, eliminate? You're going to kill it?",
        "Edmund: Well, the thought had crossed my mind, yes.",
        "Cassie: Well, why do you have to kill it? The poor little thing.",
        "Edmund: Well, what would you prefer, rehabilitation, foster care?",
        "Cassie: Edmund, stop joking. I mean, we have to do this humanely.",
        "Edmund: We?",
        "Cassie: We do.",
        "Edmund: We?",
        "Cassie: Well, yes. It's a two-person job.",
        "Edmund: All right. What are we going to do?",
        "Cassie: We are going to catch it and we're going to let it go.",
        "Edmund: Okay. Onward and upward, Buffy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Look, Alexandra, if this is about the wedding, it's under control.",
        "Alexandra: Mm-hmm. Gus tells me you're going to elope.",
        "Harley: Change of plans.",
        "Alexandra: Really?",
        "Harley: We're going to have a simple but meaningful ceremony with a few friends and family, Spauldings included. Satisfied?",
        "Alexandra: Well, does it matter?",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Alexandra: Yes. What about Gus? I'm telling you, this is going to break his heart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: If Harley wants a Spaulding-free ceremony, I don't blame her.",
        "Gus: Oh, please. Neither do I.",
        "Phillip: Yeah. I mean, I'm sure Alan will be disappointed. I'm sure he was looking forward to pulling out all the stops and doing the usual Spaulding dog and pony show.",
        "Gus: Big Al and I, we've got our issues, believe me.",
        "Phillip: Really? I thought you were the new golden boy.",
        "Gus: Oh, please.",
        "Phillip: It's okay. I'm not afraid of you moving in on my territory. You know what? I think you deserve all the praise that they're giving you. I really do. If you hadn't figured out it was Brad Green putting that antimonious on the street, we could have been in real trouble.",
        "Gus: No, no. I'm just doing my job.",
        "Phillip: Humble and heroic. I couldn't compete with that if I tried.",
        "Gus: Are we all right, me and you?",
        "Phillip: Gus, you and I are more than all right. You did me a huge favor.",
        "Gus: What, clearing up the old family name?",
        "Phillip: Well, yeah, you did that, but you also watched my back when I was in the hospital. I will not forget it. You helped to keep Olivia irrelevant at work. Soon, with any luck, she'll just be irrelevant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Refill? It's on the house.",
        "Bill: I don't want anything from you.",
        "Olivia: What did I do?",
        "Bill: Well, you didn't do anything. It's what you tried to do. You tried to make trouble for Josh and I. You failed.",
        "Olivia: No, I just... I expressed my concern. I am concerned.",
        "Bill: Oh, is that right? Olivia, you're trying to use me to get back at Phillip. I'll tell you something. It's not going to work, all right?",
        "Olivia: I can't believe you think I would play you like that.",
        "Bill: I'll tell you right now, don't ever try to play me again.",
        "Olivia: Threats. How typically male.",
        "Bill: I'm just telling you, you're out of your league, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: Really? Well, if I were you wouldn't be quite so upset, would you? Josh got to you. That was just my brush-back pitch. Watch out for my fastball, Bill. When it hits you, it hurts pretty badly .",
        "Bill: Now, is that a threat, Olivia?",
        "Olivia: Well, what can I say? I'm in touch with my masculine side. Some men are intimidated by that.",
        "Bill: Well, not the ones I'll be working with. Lewis construction is moving on to a whole new level. So mind games and dirty tricks aren't going to cut it with the boys I'll be doing business with.",
        "Olivia: Boys like Tony Santos? If you're climbing into bed with him, you're definitely going to need my help.",
        "Bill: What will you bring to the party?",
        "Olivia: Well, I keep the feds out. Two's company, three's interesting, but the feds spoil everything. Their investigation could have ruined Spaulding, but I kept the company image clean, and I can do the same for you.",
        "Bill: If I let you into my bed.",
        "Olivia: You won't be sorry.",
        "Bill: Apparently Phillip was. He tossed you out. Here you are trying to creep into mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: I think I know a little bit more about Gus' heart than you do.",
        "Alexandra: Well, all I'm saying is he deserves to have some sort of...",
        "Harley: A wedding. He deserves a wedding. I know. I figured it out all by myself, thank you. (Mel clears her throat) without you. I figured it out without you, okay? We canceled the elopement.",
        "Alexandra: What are you going to have, a nice little simple no-frills wedding?",
        "Harley: Yes. A Cooper-Aitoro affair.",
        "Alexandra: Gus is a Spaulding.",
        "Harley: By blood.",
        "Alexandra: Yes, by blood. It runs right through to his heart, trust me.",
        "Harley: Yes, yes, yes, I know. But this is what Gus wants.",
        "Alexandra: Gus wants you. You say elope, he'll say yes. I mean, you say a nice simple little no-frills wedding, he'll say yeah. You know, if you want to exchange your wedding vows stark naked, bungee jumping, he would go along with it.",
        "Harley: Wow. I hadn't thought of that one.",
        "Alexandra: Have you thought about asking Gus what he wants? By the way, he did ask me not to interfere. When it comes to something this personal in the family, I'm sorry; I just can't turn my head and look away.",
        "Blake: Of course not.",
        "Harley: Okay. What did he say, Gus?",
        "Alexandra: Well, he didn't have to say anything.",
        "Harley: Oh, so now you're the new town psychic?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, heavens, no. You know, when I saw him looking at this picture of a girl in this wedding dress, this beautiful wedding dress, he has this cute little grin, and I know he was thinking of you.",
        "Harley: Yeah. He was thinking of the time that he saw me trying on wedding dresses.",
        "Alexandra: But, that's the way he wants to see you. He's afraid if he admits it it'll make him weak, you know, or so he thinks.",
        "Blake: I think it's romantic.",
        "Mel: Hmm, so do I.",
        "Alexandra: Well, of course it is. But if it never happens, it's another empty dream. We all have plenty of those.",
        "Harley: Well, do you think that... do you think Gus really wants a big wedding with all the bells and whistles?",
        "Alexandra: I told you, Harley, he wants you. I mean, this wedding is nothing more than icing on the cake. By the way, I do happen to have a fantastic pastry chef. Say the word; I'll give him a call. Okay. I would appreciate if you didn't tell him I was here. Gus and I seem to be getting along very well these days.",
        "Harley: Yeah. I meant to ask you about that. How come?",
        "Alexandra: Well, I think now that we finally share something very important... yeah. Well...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Blood! That flying rat was out for blood. God, we were just trying to save its life. Ew!",
        "Edmund: Well, I think perhaps it misunderstood our intention.",
        "Cassie: Well, you could have been gentler with the mop. And thank god I was there to cover it with the bucket.",
        "Edmund: Thank God you then proceeded to scream, \"What do I do now? What do I do now?\"",
        "Cassie: It was a rhetorical question.",
        "Edmund: Oh, was it?",
        "Cassie: Yes.",
        "Edmund: Well, at least I came to your rescue.",
        "Cassie: You did not come to my rescue. I was just fine, thank you very much.",
        "Edmund: Oh, come on, admit it. You needed me.",
        "Cassie: I did not.",
        "Edmund: Oh, yes, you did.",
        "Cassie: I did not.",
        "Edmund: Yes, you did.",
        "Cassie: I did not.",
        "Edmund: Say it, Cassie. Tell me you needed me. I need to hear you say it.",
        "Cassie: I need you, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Cassie...",
        "Cassie: You need me.",
        "Cassie: Stay.",
        "Edmund: I can't.",
        "Cassie: Stay with me.",
        "Edmund: I can't.",
        "Cassie: Yes. I know you want to, Edmund. I can feel it in your lips. I can see it in your eyes.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, it's my heart talking, and I've got to listen to my head.",
        "Cassie: Why?",
        "Edmund: Because if I don't, we are both going to end up being hurt.",
        "Cassie: Well, it's too late.",
        "Edmund: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.",
        "Cassie: So am I. Edmund, I'm sorry for everything. You know, if you stay I promise I won't make you carry any heavy boxes tomorrow. I promise.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, Cassie, we had fun tonight. Let's just leave it at that, all right?",
        "Cassie: I can't. You're always going to be here. You're always going to be here.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I just don't want you wasting your time wishing for something that is just not going to happen.",
        "Cassie: I'm not, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: I've got to go.",
        "Cassie: Thank you. Thanks for helping me with the bat. Thank you.",
        "Edmund: You're welcome. Good night.",
        "Cassie: Good night. Good night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: So honestly, you're not going to give me any advice on this whole wedding thing?",
        "Phillip: Actually, you know what? I did think of a piece of advice that I can give you.",
        "Gus: Well, don't be cheap. Lay it on me.",
        "Phillip: Here's what you do. I want you to really think about my marriage, okay? Study it very, very closely, and do the exact opposite.",
        "Gus: Oh, ouch. If you really feel that way, why are you still married to her?",
        "Phillip: Oh, Gus, it's complicated. Everybody always assumes that marriage is about unconditional love and trust, and you know, sometimes it's about other needs.",
        "Gus: Just tell me that, you know, even if it's not perfect it can still be good.",
        "Phillip: Gus, you can still change your mind. You can do the big wedding.",
        "Gus: Oh, right. No, no, no. This is Harley's gig, and if she wants to elope, that's what we're doing. We're eloping.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: I just wish I knew what Gus wanted, you know? If he really does want a big blowout wedding...",
        "Mel: I would consider the source very carefully if I were you.",
        "Blake: I know. Alexandra isn't exactly an authority on Gus.",
        "Harley: Yeah. Yeah, but Gus has been spending a lot of time with Alan and Alexandra lately. It's almost like they share something I'm not a part of. More importantly, why would she lie?",
        "Blake: Because she's Alex.",
        "Mel: Well, let's think about this logically.",
        "Harley: Spoken like a true lawyer.",
        "Mel: Right. You know Gus probably better than anybody. Do you see him wanting a big, fancy wedding?",
        "Harley: Well, if you'd asked me this a year ago, I would have said no. But, a year ago I didn't see Gus shining his shoes and going to work at Spaulding as a Spaulding and liking it.",
        "Blake: Yeah, well, executive men's room, big shiny table in the boardroom, cute secretaries-- you know, what's not to like?",
        "Harley: I think it was feeling like a son to someone, you know? Like being a part of a family again.",
        "Mel: And now that Eden's gone...",
        "Harley: Yes. They're all he's got.",
        "Blake: No, he has you.",
        "Harley: But see, he's caught in the middle, you know, between me and them. What if he really does want a Spaulding wedding, but he's turning it down because of me?",
        "Mel: I wish there was some sort of test you could give them both.",
        "Harley: Melisande Boudreau- Bauer, you are an angel.",
        "Mel: I am?",
        "Harley: Yes. Thanks to you, I know exactly what I'm going to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: I really appreciate your time and your effort.",
        "Super: You look like a standup guy. Take your time.",
        "Josh: Thank you. I appreciate that. Billy, its Josh. Listen, you might want to get over here as quick as you can, okay? Call me back. I think Bill might be in worse shape than we thought.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: I don't need a man to bail me out, Bill. I just need a business partner.",
        "Bill: Well, I'm not interested in any kind of partnership with you.",
        "Olivia: Well, it's just as well. You probably wouldn't appreciate what I bring to the table or to the bed. You're so messed up over losing Eden and what happened with Danny I'd be better off taking all my assets to someone with a whole lot less baggage.",
        "Bill: Baggage? I'm the one with baggage? You're the one with the husband and the kid. Desperation.",
        "Olivia: And what does talking to Tony Santos make you? We're both desperate. We're desperate to change our lives.",
        "Bill: Well, my life is fine.",
        "Olivia: Fine. When you're tired of being daddy and uncle josh's hired hand, you give me a call, because we could do amazing things together.",
        "Bill: Well, sweet little birdie, looks like you're going to have to fly solo on this one, on all fronts.",
        "Olivia: Well, then, you don't know what you're going to be missing. On all fronts.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Cassie: So what, you're just going to take off?",
        "Jeffrey: Mrs. Winslow, I'm going to get on the first plane that I can find.",
        "Michelle: Wow. Please tell me we slept together."
