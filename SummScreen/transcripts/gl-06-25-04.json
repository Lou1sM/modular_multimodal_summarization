        "Gus: Hey. That's nice. You've got the flowers going.",
        "Harley: Yes. Well, I'm pulling out all the stops.",
        "Gus: You know, you don't have to do this. Really, it's just Alexandra and Alan.",
        "Harley: Well, I need to soften the blow. Your family's not going to like it when they find out we're eloping.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "(Both laugh)",
        "Harley: You're excited, aren't you? Right?",
        "Gus: About eloping, yeah.",
        "Harley: Tell me you're not going to be too disappointed not having the big wedding. I mean I know your family has their heart set on the big Spaulding wedding.",
        "Gus: No. Come on, this is about us. This is not about them.",
        "Harley: Exactly. That's exactly how I feel.",
        "Gus: Okay.",
        "Harley: So I was wondering, we don't have to do just a small, little justice of the peace thing, do we?",
        "Gus: Really? It's okay.",
        "Harley: Well, I was thinking of something maybe a little more festive. (Laughs)",
        "Gus: Oh, maybe we could do a little chapel, like 12 guests.",
        "Harley: We could do Niagara Falls? (Laughs)",
        "Gus: The place with all the water.",

        "Cassie: I just wanted to thank you for giving me the advice about Edmund.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you don't have to thank me.",
        "Cassie: I do. I mean, just when I think about the worst about you, you turn around do something that makes me realize that, well, you really are a stand- up kind of guy.",
        "Yoga instructor: Hey.",
        "Jeffrey: Hi. Did you find your bag?",
        "Yoga instructor: Yeah, under the bed of course.",

        "Jeffrey: Oh, she's your yoga instructor? She's... well, she's mine now, too. What?",
        "Cassie: Nothing. Just for a second there I forgot what a shallow instant gratification, jump on anything that moves kind of guy you are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Oh, I am sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you up. I just... I thought maybe you were cold. I'm sorry.",
        "Michelle: No, that's okay. You know, you don't have to be here all the time, Dan.",
        "Danny: I prefer Danny.",
        "Michelle: Right.",
        "Danny: So now you're okay, do you want to work on your memory some more? We can go over the pictures again. I can answer your questions.",
        "Michelle: No, no. You know what? No. I'm good with the pictures right now. I mean, they didn't really work anyway. So, I mean...",

        "Michelle: Maybe... maybe if you just um...",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Michelle: Maybe if you touch me. No, like this.",
        "Michelle: Sorry. Nothing. Don't get me wrong. I mean, it's nice.",
        "Danny: No, it's okay. It's okay. I understand. Its okay, I'm serious. The important thing is that you're awake and you're recovering. I'm very grateful for that. I can't ask for everything at once. The rest will come. I'm not going anywhere. Do you want this?",
        "Michelle: Thanks. Wait. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Don't tell me. Don't tell me. I know that face. I know that face. Okay, okay. Hang on. Marina cooper.",
        "Danny: Right. Very good.",

        "Michelle: Good, good. So you go, you go and marina will keep me company, right?",
        "Danny: Okay. All right, I won't be far.",
        "Michelle: All right. So what's our deal? We're, like best friends forever or do we secretly hate each others guts?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Hello.",
        "Alan: Hello.",
        "Gus: Welcome. Come on in. Harley's in the kitchen. And the grub will be up in just a few minutes.",
        "Alan: Well, Gus, thank you for having us over this evening. You know we should do this more often.",
        "Gus: Alan, stop. I know why you're here. You're here for the mac and cheese. I'm not a fool. (Laughter) now listen, who wants something to drink?",
        "Alan: That's true.",
        "Gus: We've got beer and we've got beer. So thrilling.",
        "Alexandra: Beer. Beer... beer it is.",
        "Gus: Beer. And that works because that's what we have.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, Gus seems pretty relaxed, doesn't he?",
        "Gus: Why shouldn't he?",
        "Alexandra: Well, because he's got a lot of pressure on him... so he keeps reminding me.",
        "Gus: Hi. There you go.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, merci.",
        "Gus: I wonder why Gus would have that kind of pressure in his life.",
        "Alan: Now, Gus, you've made the decision to protect her. Now you're going to have to find a way of living with that.",
        "Gus: I can live with it. I can keep a secret. Just don't make me regret it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Hello, everyone.",
        "Gus: Honey.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, Harley.",
        "Harley: Soup is on.",
        "Gus: Alexandra.",

        "Harley: Well, and macaroni and cheese for you, Alan.",
        "Alan: Oh, yes.",
        "Harley: But you can thank company for the mashed potatoes and gravy and the chicken pot pie and the cornbread and the apple pie. (Laughs)",
        "Alexandra: My, my out the window with my low-carb diet.",
        "Alan: Well, you're going to have to indulge yourself this evening because Harley makes excellent macaroni and cheese.",
        "Harley: Yes. Well, I wanted tonight to be special, you know, family and comfort food. Enjoying the simple life, right? Life's simple pleasures. Anyway me and Gus, we are, you know, simple folks. We like to keep things simple.",
        "Alexandra: Is this your simple way of telling us you've decided against letting us host the wedding?",
        "Gus: We want to say it's very nice of you to extend yourself in anyway. But we have made alternative arrangements.",
        "Alan: Whatever wedding you planned for, know that we are behind you 100%.",
        "Gus: Right. Well, like, I had told Alexandra before, we want to elope.",
        "Harley: To Niagara falls.",

        "Jeffrey: (Whistling) wow.",
        "Cassie: Don't you knock?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, the door was open. Kind of.",
        "Cassie: What are you even doing here?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I'm looking for you. What do you think I'm doing here?",
        "Cassie: You can't just walk into my home and make yourself comfortable, Mr. O'Neill?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you can't just bump into me on the stairway of the beacon hotel and be rude to me about my private life, Mrs. Winslow.",
        "Cassie: If you're waiting for an apology, you're going to be waiting a long time.",
        "Jeffrey: I've got all day. (Whistling)",
        "Cassie: Okay, fine. Do you want to know what my problem is?",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, I would love to know what your problem is.",
        "Cassie: You are a grown man. You're a district attorney, but you walk around town acting like you're a college kid on spring break. And you can't live like that.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, who says? You? You know what I don't get is why you care how I live my life or who I sleep with. What difference does it make to you?",
        "Cassie: I don't care who you sleep with. I mean, why would I care who you sleep with? I just don't appreciate being lied to, that's all.",
        "Jeffrey: Lied to? When did I lie to you?",
        "Cassie: Oh, when you said you cared about my niece.",
        "Jeffrey: First of all, I put Marah on the plane because I did care about her. A lot, okay. I put her on that plane because it was the right thing to do and it was the best thing for her. And secondly, well, I forget about secondly. But please, Mrs. Winslow, continue your ramblings, because I am just fascinated. What?",
        "Cassie: Forget it.",
        "Jeffrey: No, no, not forget it. What?",
        "Cassie: Richard use to come here, you know. And seeing you sitting over there just freaks me out. All right?",
        "Jeffrey: I'm sorry. I'm sorry about that. And I'm sorry about not knocking before I came in. Now it's your turn.",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Jeffrey: I said, I'm sorry. Now it's your turn.",
        "Cassie: I guess I'm sorry for insulting you at the beacon. Now if you want to screw up your life that's your problem.",
        "Jeffrey: Apology accepted. I think. So you're really going to move back in here?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. I had some good times here. Some bad times here. But... I don't know. I feel like this place just keeps calling me back. I guess everybody has a place like that, huh?",
        "Jeffrey: No. No, not everyone. I mean I think this is like the longest I'd ever stayed in one place because of my job.",
        "Cassie: So what are you just going to take off when you wrap up this Salerno thing?",
        "Jeffrey: (Laughs) Mrs. Winslow, I'm going to get on the first plane that I can find once I wrap up this case.",
        "Cassie: Wow. I would buy you a going-away present, if I believed you for one second.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Yeah, well, you got here a little late.",
        "Marina: Late?",
        "Michelle: Yeah, you just missed feeding time.",
        "Marina: I don't understand.",
        "Michelle: Stick around. You will. See I'm like an exhibit at the zoo. People come here and they watch and they stare and they toss the occasional peanut...",
        "Marina: Maybe I should go.",
        "Michelle: No, stick around. Heck. Tell me what we used to do for fun.",
        "Marina: Well, we've been really good friends. We just became really close recently. And I guess there wasn't very much time for fun.",
        "Michelle: What was keeping us so busy?",
        "Marina: I guess you don't remember Carrie.",
        "Michelle: I don't remember anyone, marina. But you know, tell me about her. Was she one of our friends?",
        "Marina: No, no. She was definitely not.",
        "Michelle: Okay. Can you be a little more vague? I mean your worst than Danny.",
        "Marina: Well, I'm sure he's doing his best. He just wants to help you.",
        "Michelle: Yeah. Yeah, why don't you tell me what you think of him?",
        "Marina: I don't know. I know how much he loves you. I mean you can't say Michelle in town without saying Michelle and Danny. You guys were like a super couple.",
        "Michelle: Super couple. Great. No pressure there.",
        "Marina: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...",
        "Michelle: No, no. No. Of course you didn't. Nobody does. You know, everyone just wants their wife or their friend or their sister back. I mean isn't that what you're here for?",
        "Marina: What? I came to see you.",
        "Michelle: Really? To see me or to watch? Did you know that Danny sits here and watches me sleep? Is that a little weird?",
        "Marina: I don't think you should take that out on him.",
        "Michelle: And whom am I going to take it on, you?",
        "Marina: Okay.",
        "Michelle: Okay, maybe you should go.",
        "Marina: You know, I'll come visit again soon.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, right. I believe that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shayne: How are you doing?",
        "Sandy: Oh, hey. Hey. Just checking my e-mail.",
        "Shayne: Just checking your e- mail. So you check your e-mail in Swahili these days?",
        "Sandy: Oh...",
        "Shayne: What kind of weird computer language is this here?",
        "Sandy: Just... I don't know. I was just messing around.",
        "Shayne: Just messing around. Well, you know what? You should be... you should be marina should be working on your project, because you don't want to show up to that boardroom with nothing to show.",
        "Sandy: Don't worry. I've got something in the works.",
        "Shayne: You've got something good enough to impress the wizard of Spaulding?",
        "Sandy: The wizard was just an ordinary guy hanging out behind a curtain. I'm not worried about impressing Alan.",
        "Shayne: You sound pretty confident there, brother.",
        "Sandy: Well, I'm a confident guy. Alan Spaulding doesn't give any of us enough credit. But after I'm through with him, he will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: I just didn't want this wedding to be like any of my other Spaulding weddings. And, Niagara Falls can be very tasteful. And cost efficient.",
        "Alan: Oh, cheap.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: I actually heard about a place where you could actually rent a wedding dress by the hour. So there you go. (Laughter)",
        "Alexandra: Well, how convenient.",
        "Harley: Yes. I say if you're going to go different, you should go different. You know what I mean? (Laughter)",
        "Gus: This will be different. This will be very different.",
        "Harley: Okay. So go ahead. Tell me what you really think.",
        "Alexandra: Well, we think that we want whatever you and Gus want.",
        "Alan: Absolutely. As matter of fact, I have a very good friend who owns a hotel up there. I will call him to make sure you have excellent accommodations. And consider this a wedding gift.",
        "Gus: I thought he was going to say he's got a friend that owns Niagara Falls. (Laughter) but we want to thank you. That is a very generous-- thank you, right? Offer.",
        "Harley: Okay, you win.",
        "Alexandra: Win? Win what?",
        "Harley: I thought that by pushing a few of your buttons and by twisting your arm, I can get you all to admit how you really feel about this wedding. But you've been respectful. Even supportive.",
        "Alan: Why are you surprised?",
        "Harley: I am pleasantly surprised. Did you really think that I was going to make you go through a drive-through with me in a rented wedding dress? I think we both deserve a little bit better than that.",
        "Gus: Oh, yeah.",
        "Harley: And I realize now that the two of you are just trying to understand us. So I think I should work a little harder to try to understand you. We'll be family. So in the spirit of full disclosure...",
        "Gus: Take it easy, honey. Don't... don't push it.",
        "Harley: No, I really feel like I need to say this.",
        "Gus: Okay. I have been suspicious of the two of you lately for a lot of reasons. I was wrong about your intentions, about your motives, about our wedding. Sweetie, your wedding day should be unlike any other day in your life. I want ours to be that kind of special. With every step that I take I want to know that I am getting closer and closer to the man that I have waited my whole life for and that every missed step I took was just the scenic route to getting to you. A man who taught me how to love again and to trust again. Because I love you. And I do trust you. You are my whole heart. Having said that since I have no idea how to throw a party that says something that big, how'd you like to throw us a wedding?",
        "Alan: Wow! (Laughter)",
        "Alexandra: Well... (Sighs)",
        "Michelle: Okay. I know this. I'm feeling a Cathy. Cathy, right? Cassie. Oh, close. Okay. And this the red head. She's... what's her name? I know this one. I know this one. This is Blake. This is Blake. Yes, yes. I rock. All right, give me more. Give me more. (Knock at the door) come in. Wow. Please tell me we slept together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Coming up on \"Guiding Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: I can't do this.",
        "Gus: What?",
        "Harley: There's something I need to tell you about Alexandra.",
        "Michelle: Home?",
        "Rick: Your test came back, Michelle. There's no reason for me to keep you here.",
        "Jeffrey: Trust me, Mrs. Winslow; I am going to buy a one-way ticket destination anyway out of this one-horse town as soon as I get a chance.",
        "Cassie: I thought you were a good liar.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm not lying, okay. That's the truth.",
        "Cassie: You've made connections in this town. Yes, you've annoyed almost everyone in it, but it's still a connection.",
        "Jeffrey: Even you, Mrs. Winslow, can understand that I don't connect with anyone in this town.",
        "Cassie: Well, that's just sad. Because there's nothing more satisfying than a meaningful relationship between two people who care about each other.",
        "Jeffrey: Speaking of Eddie boy, where is he?",
        "Cassie: Look, Edmund and I have a real problem, okay. Which means that we have something real. I just hope that he has faith in that and he's going to come back to me.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, maybe it's just the lawyer in me, but I prefer to have faith in more tangible things. Like the plane ticket that's going to be in my hand when I get out of this town. See you.",
        "Cassie: So annoying.",
        "Jeffrey: Do you ever wonder why I annoy you so much, Mrs. Winslow? It's not that hard to figure out, is it? Maybe it's because I have your husband's face. So every time I do something that isn't prince-like or Richard-like, you freak out.",
        "Cassie: Okay, fine. That's why you annoy me. Why do I annoy you? What have I ever done to you?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, maybe you remind me of someone, too.",
        "Cassie: Was it an ex?",
        "Jeffrey: Something like that.",
        "Cassie: Where is she?",
        "Jeffrey: She's... she's gone.",
        "Cassie: So was it a bad relationship?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, it was toxic as a matter of fact. But I ended it before any real damage was done if you really need to know.",
        "Cassie: Did you love her?",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, this is getting little too heavy for me. I got to go.",
        "Cassie: Wait a second. Why are you telling me this now?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, because you told me that I didn't care about anybody. I wanted to show that maybe, just maybe, you were wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: So you said your name is Bill, right?",
        "Bill: Bill. That is correct.",
        "Michelle: Right.",
        "Bill: In fact, we were best friends growing up.",
        "Michelle: Yep, see, there you are.",
        "Bill: This is so weird. I feel like you're going to wink at me and tell me its one big joke.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, well, that's not going to happen. I'm sorry if I freaked you out before when you came to the door. I was actually kind of glad to see you thinking maybe you were an ex-boyfriend or something.",
        "Bill: Oh.",
        "Michelle: No? We were just friends. Was I blind before I went in this coma?",
        "Bill: Oh, now you're making me blush.",
        "Michelle: You didn't answer my question.",
        "Bill: No, you weren't blind. But we actually did try to make a go of it.",
        "Michelle: Really?",
        "Billy: Really.",
        "Michelle: What happened? Did you break my heart? Or did I break yours?",
        "Bill: Um...",
        "Michelle: And don't tell me it was one of the mutual things because I'm not going to buy it.",
        "Bill: No. No, no. Actually you were hung up on someone else.",
        "Michelle: Let me guess. Danny, right?",
        "Bill: Yep. Danny. What?",
        "Michelle: You don't like him. So, you're my best friend and you hate my husband? Okay, this you have to tell me about, because this is interesting.",
        "Bill: Michelle, it's really not too much to...",
        "Michelle: No, tell me. Come on. Nobody will give me any dirt around here.",
        "Bill: You know what? It doesn't matter what I think now, because it didn't matter then. I mean he's a guy. You knew the good, the bad and the ugly about him and you still wanted to be with him. So...",
        "Michelle: Yeah, I mean, I guess I can see that. You know, he's sweet, right? I mean, obviously he's hot.",
        "Bill: Yeah. Well, the truth is he's loyal to just one thing.",
        "Michelle: Himself?",
        "Bill: No. You.",
        "Michelle: The pressure returns. You know, but the thing that I don't get about this is everyone keeps saying how much we loved each other, but then why don't I feel anything? Unless... unless our marriage wasn't so picture perfect. Maybe... maybe we were just keeping up appearances.",
        "Bill: No, I wanted to believe the same thing, but you two are the real deal. He loves you and you love him.",
        "Michelle: Now I feel bad for getting annoyed with the guy. You know, he's been hanging out here just looking at me, waiting for me to give him a sign that his wife's still in here somewhere.",
        "Bill: You know what, Michelle? I don't have faith in a lot of things. But I do believe one thing. That you and Danny are going to find a way through this. It's just... it's just who you are.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, except I don't really remember who that is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Danny, good news, Michelle's test have come back. Physically she's fine. She can go home.",
        "Danny: You're kidding. That's great. This is great. Because I know as soon as she gets home, she'll... things will start coming back to her. She'll be sleeping in her own bed and she'll be surrounded by familiar things.",
        "Rick: Danny, obviously, I'm really happy that she's going home too, but Michelle's going to need some time. I mean, a lifetime of memories are not going to... come flying back the moment she walks through the door. We need to be patient here.",
        "Danny: Right. Well, I choose to be optimistic, Rick. Is that all right with you? Michelle's going to come back to me. You'll see.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shayne: So how was your visit with Michelle?",
        "Marina: Not as much fun as your perfume project.",
        "Shayne: You know, I was thinking, you know, after everything you and Michelle went through and Marah, maybe, you know, you'd be able to connect with her better.",
        "Marina: No. No, it was like I was looking at my friend and talking to a total stranger. It's just bizarre. She kind of made me upset. We really should get back to work.",
        "Shayne: Are you okay?",
        "Marina: Yeah. Go. I'll be fine.",
        "Shayne: All right. Let's do it. I'll call you later, okay. I love you.",
        "Marina: Love you. Hi.",
        "Sandy: Oh, hey. Hey, hey, hey.",
        "Marina: Sorry I'm late. How's it going?",
        "Sandy: It's going. I was just messing around waiting for you.",
        "Marina: Question.",
        "Sandy: Already? I haven't even finished a sentence.",
        "Marina: Question about Kyra.",
        "Sandy: Okay, shoot.",
        "Marina: Are guys seriously dumb enough to fall for her whole act?",
        "Sandy: Oh. Well, since she's hot, yeah. But if you're worried about Shayne, I don't...",
        "Marina: Oh, no, no. I know Shayne's not interested her. But I'm interested in beating her at this intern competition. Although that means beating Shayne too.",
        "Sandy: I think he'll get over it, partner. All's fair in... well, actually no. Nothing's fair here at Spaulding.",
        "Marina: So do you have any ideas we can pitch to Alan about our project?",
        "Sandy: No.",
        "Marina: Then what are you working on?",
        "Sandy: Trust me. You don't want to know. That way you have plausible deniability.",
        "Marina: (Laughs) whoa there. \"Plausible deniability.\" Who's playing detective now, chief? Spill it.",
        "Sandy: Spill it? Well, if I don't, officer cooper, what am I looking at here? A strip search? A beat down? Jail time?",
        "Marina: Game over. I'm serious, sandy. Tell me.",
        "Sandy: I'm hacking into Alan's Spaulding's computer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Harley, I know that you're making a sacrifice allowing our family to host your wedding.",
        "Harley: Well, your family and my family are going to be family soon. Again.",
        "Alan: Yes. This time we're going to get it right.",
        "Harley: (Laughs)",
        "Alan: I will also try to keep a close reign on Alexandra during your wedding planning.",
        "Harley: That'll be greatly appreciated. Thank you, Alan.",
        "Alan: I know you're including us because you love Gus very much. And I'm very glad he has you in his life.",
        "Harley: Thank you, Alan. But I'm the lucky one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Gus, I hate to bring this up tonight. But have you taken care of that Mrs. Geoffrey note that you've found in brad's things?",
        "Gus: Alexandra, come on. This isn't the time.",
        "Alexandra: I know, but I can't stop thinking about it. That's the only piece of paper I know about that could lead to me or point a finger to me now. Have you?",
        "Gus: Not now, okay?",
        "Alexandra: Harley, I'm going to call you first thing. And we're going to start on the details.",
        "Harley: Great.",
        "Alexandra: Okay, darling. Good night.",
        "Alan: Well, good night, Harley. Thank you for the wonderful meal.",
        "Harley: Thanks, Alan.",
        "Gus: Thanks.",
        "Alan: Good night, son.",
        "Gus: Good night.",
        "Alexandra: Good night.",
        "Gus: Get home safe.",
        "Alexandra: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Baby, so what was it? What changed your mind?",
        "Harley: I told you. I want our wedding to be special. Not that a wedding in Niagara Falls wouldn't have been special.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: Almost as special as a big, fat cooper wedding or a shotgun wedding in the back of a pick-up.",
        "Gus: Yeah, now, see I like that one.",
        "Harley: (Laughs)",
        "Gus: You never asked me about that one.",
        "Harley: But any doubts that I had about you wanting a big wedding were erased when I saw the look on your face after I gave the okay.",
        "Gus: Honey, you know me. I don't need a big old fancy wedding. I just... this is the very last wedding either one of us are ever going to have, you understand? And so I think, you know, maybe we should do it up right that's all. And I... I love you for making that happen.",
        "Harley: I can't do this.",
        "Gus: What?",
        "Harley: I... there's something I need to tell you about Alexandra.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: So can you really break into Alan's records?",
        "Sandy: Well, I haven't yet, but I'm getting warmer.",
        "Marina: I don't understand why you're willing to risk your internship like this. I mean, don't you want to win the competition?",
        "Sandy: Well, there's more than one way to win. I may not get very far in this competition, but if I pull one over on Alan Spaulding, that's a victory in and of itself.",
        "Marina: Man, you must really hate this guy.",
        "Sandy: No, I just detest his condescension and how he feels entitled to manipulate our lives. Did you notice how when he paired us off, he split up you and Shayne and Tammy and Joey to provide some conflict? Well, that's probably another one of his lessons. And while it may seem clich\u00e9, I want to teach him a lesson.",
        "Marina: You are going to teach Alan a lesson?",
        "Sandy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Marina: I got to be in on this.",
        "Sandy: You want to help?",
        "Marina: Sure. Although, you know, I may lose my membership in the Alan Spaulding fan club.",
        "Sandy: And you wouldn't want to do that.",
        "Marina: So catch me up.",
        "Sandy: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I'm not above admitting that I was wrong about you. I just think that you have to admit that, you know, you're wrong too if you think that it's not possible for you to have a meaningful relationship again.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I'm not good at meaningful. I don't put down roots. And I don't develop warm, fuzzy connections.",
        "Cassie: That's because you're probably afraid to feel how you felt when you were with... what did you say her name was?",
        "Jeffrey: I didn't. This is getting a little too heavy for me.",
        "Cassie: You know, work on your hang ups, Jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: Why? Hang ups are good, Mrs. Winslow. Yeah, hang ups prevent you from making the same mistake twice. Hang ups are great for holding on to grudges. And no one can hold a grudge like I can.",
        "Cassie: Want to bet?",
        "Jeffrey: Oh. Okay, how's this? Ricky Sabatino. Fourth grade. Stole a ham sandwich right out of my lunch box.",
        "Cassie: Gracie Mckewan. Second grade. Dropped my pink plastic head band in a mud puddle.",
        "Jeffrey: That's pretty good, but I'm not buying it. Anyone who holds on to grudges wouldn't be with Eddie boy.",
        "Cassie: Well, if I saw Gracie tomorrow, I'd still want to punch her in the face.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, yeah?",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, how's this? I just last year ran a check on little Ricky and found out he was doing 15 to 20 for grand theft auto.",
        "Cassie: Well, that's a step up from a ham sandwich.",
        "Jeffrey: And on top of it, I called the warden to make sure that I'd put in a bad word for him.",
        "Cassie: Wow. Well, I think you win.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: I don't know what I was thinking protecting you from Alexandra. I should have told you about this right from the start.",
        "Gus: Please just say it.",
        "Harley: Alexandra broke your confidence. I didn't sense that you wanted a big wedding. Alexandra told me that you wanted a big wedding.",
        "Gus: Oh.",
        "Harley: I think her heart was in the right place.",
        "Gus: Uh-huh. Yeah.",
        "Harley: What's wrong? What did you think I was going to tell you?",
        "Gus: Oh, I don't know. Something like you're not getting into the Spaulding thing. You don't like... you don't get along with everybody. I don't know. You know, this whole thing has kind of made me... I mean, I'm loopy over it.",
        "Harley: Yeah, I'm pretty loopy myself. Because if you think about it, a couple of weeks ago, we were ready to arrest your family for drug running. And now they're throwing our wedding.",
        "Gus: How about that?",
        "Harley: Yeah. You know, it's funny, sweetie, because if you think about it, I'm finally at peace with your family and you and I have found peace now that the drug case is over.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: Brad Green seems to have found some peace, I hope, from this weird little speech, God free. I know that I'll be sleeping peacefully now that the decision with the wedding has been made. (Laughs)",
        "Gus: I just want to be your husband. That's all I want. I just want to be your husband and as long as that happens, I don't care how it happens.",
        "Harley: Oh, honey. Well, it's going to happen. And it's going to happen big. And it's going to happen with monogrammed invitations and china patterns.",
        "Gus: Oh, you're going to get it now.",
        "Harley: And a big fancy...",
        "Gus: Graphs and charts.",
        "Harley: ...Wedding dress that cost more than my car.",
        "Gus: (Laughs)",
        "Harley: The important thing is that when I walk down that aisle, you think that I'm the most beautiful bride in the world.",
        "Gus: That's the thing. I already think you're the most beautiful bride. I don't need you to walk down an aisle.",
        "Harley: we don't need any stinking aisles.",
        "Gus: We don't need that. Look it, I'll clean up a little bit.",
        "Harley: You sure?",
        "Gus: Why don't you jump in the shower? Go on upstairs.",
        "Harley: Are you sure?",
        "Gus: I got it.",
        "Harley: Thanks.",
        "Gus: No problem. Well, Mr. Green, you weren't trying to say a little prayer. God free. You were trying to take Alexandra down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: No bacon. Bacon and non-sausage.",
        "Michelle: Nah-uh.",
        "Bill: Yes.",
        "Michelle: Get out.",
        "Bill: Yes. I've seen you eat a whole pile. Like a bacon and sausage piled up.",
        "Rick: That's true.",
        "Michelle: I'll guess I'll have to try it again. Can I get a pizza in here?",
        "Rick: No, but you can have one delivered at home.",
        "Michelle: Home?",
        "Rick: Your tests came back, Michelle. There's no reason for me to keep you here.",
        "Danny: Yep. As soon as I'm finished with this paperwork, we're out of here. This is great. You're going to be able to sleep in your own bed tonight and be surrounded all your things at home.",
        "Michelle: And you're going to be there?",
        "Danny: Yeah, of course, I'M... I'm not going anywhere. Don't worry. I'll get you through this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Michelle, this is great. It's just in time for the Bauer barbecue.",
        "Rick: Yeah.",
        "Bill: It's a tradition your family does every Fourth of July.",
        "Rick: Basically the whole town shows up in the backyard. The Coppers, Lewis's, Marler's, Spaulding's.",
        "Danny: Oh, yeah, hey, there are always fireworks.",
        "Rick: Yeah. We try to keep them in the sky, but sometimes there's a few on the ground too. Depends on the guest list.",
        "Bill: Yeah, that's right. And of course, what else is on the ground? Eggshells.",
        "Rick: Eggshells.",
        "Bill: We have the egg toss.",
        "Rick: Which didn't go very well last year, did it?",
        "Bill: Why? I thought it went fine.",
        "Rick: I didn't think so. Did Cassie and Edmund win that thing?",
        "Bill: Reva and Marah, I believe.",
        "Danny: You know, Michelle, last year's barbecue was really big for us.",
        "Rick: Oh, my goodness. It's already a year.",
        "Bill: That's true.",
        "Michelle: Can you guys, just stop it. Can you just stop it? I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know who you're talking about the egg tosses and the fireworks. Just stop. Just get out. Leave me alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Next on \"Guiding Light.\"",
        "Lizzie: The job is as good as yours. You got the money. You can still work on the project. Come here. This is all going to work out. Just stick with me, okay? I promise you.",
        "Danny: What's with the attitude, Michelle? Who do you think you are giving these guys a hard time?",
        "Cassie: I thought you like the farm, Tammy?",
        "Tammy: That doesn't mean I want to live here now. I'm sorry, mom, but we might as well be on mars; we're so far removed from everything."
