        "Lizzie: Ow! Ow! Tammy, I'm serious, I'm not faking it this time! Ow!",
        "Tammy: Lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: (Breathing hard) There is something wrong with the baby. There is something wrong with the baby!",
        "Tammy: Okay, Lizzie, just calm down. Try to breathe.",
        "Lizzie: The baby is...",
        "Tammy: All right, the baby is going to be fine. I'll get you right over to Cedars.",
        "Lizzie: No, no, no, I don't want to go!",
        "Tammy: If there's something wrong, you have to go to the hospital, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, God, why is my life always so messed up? Okay, I am pregnant. People are supposed to be making a fuss over me. I am supposed to be shopping for baby stuff from dawn until my ankles swell. I'm supposed to be married to Coop. And look at me... I am all alone. And everyone... ow!",
        "Tammy: Lizzie, it's not all about you anymore. You've got to take care of Jonathan's baby, okay?",
        "Lizzie: (Gasping)",
        "Tammy: Let's go.",
        "Lizzie: Oh... ow!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Let's sit down.",
        "Alan: You know, we have more things to worry about than young Henry.",
        "Beth: Alan. Lizzie asked you... no, she practically begged you to help her get Coop back. Now, what could be more important than her peace of mind? Especially when she's carrying a baby.",
        "Alan: Trust me, Beth. Elizabeth will be content, and that baby will be protected and safe. After all, isn't that what we all want?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: You would think there'd be at least one Spaulding-free day a week.",
        "Ava: Relax. I'll wait on them.",
        "Coop: What? No, hey! Ava, stop.",
        "Ava: No, it's cool.",
        "Coop: No, it's not cool. I can't let you do that.",
        "Ava: I have a great idea.",
        "Coop: An idea.",
        "Ava: How about this?",
        "Coop: What's your idea?",
        "Ava: How about we flip on it?",
        "Coop: We're going to flip on it? No. Give me this.",
        "Ava: No!",
        "Coop: No, look, I've got a better idea. Just listen to me, all right?",
        "Ava: Okay.",
        "Coop: How about we both just leave? Simple.",
        "Ava: We're just going to leave, like, as in go someplace else? Right now?",
        "Coop: Yes! We're going to go somewhere else right now. Look, it's dead in here, all right? And besides, I'm sure Lynn can handle herself. She was just telling me, by the way, that she's going to make lousy tips today. So honestly, we would be doing her a favor by taking off.",
        "Ava: Mmm, okay. And where would we go?",
        "Coop: Well, it's funny that you ask that, because Harley asked me to do a favor for her. So I want you to come with me. Please? Pretty please? Yes?",
        "Ava: Umm... sold!",
        "Coop: Sold? Yes, I like that.",
        "Ava: Okay, let's go.",
        "Coop: Come on. Uh, you're not going to need that, for one thing. Come here. All right, got your stuff?",
        "Ava: Yeah.",
        "Coop: We're out of here.",
        "Ava: Okay. Oh, hi!",
        "Coop: Hi, Blake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: Cassie, I want to talk to you about the Fourth of July celebration, the one with Josh and his veterans' project, because I heard that Jeffrey O'Neill is a part of this. And if that man is, I want in too, okay? I'm not letting him take all the prime photo ops here, so... pencil me in. Oh, God, are you blowing me off?",
        "Cassie: Um... no, I, I... have you ever had something just sneak its way into your head, and no matter what you do, you can't get it out?",
        "Blake: Something or someone?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: So, this is it, huh? This is how it works now? You just tell me you're going to go away for a while and that's it?",
        "Reva: I'll be back as soon as I can.",
        "Josh: Where are you going?",
        "Reva: Uh, you know there's this story that I've been following in... Minnesota, I... it could be my comeback to WSPR if I really wanted it to be. I mean, I thought I'd visit pop, you know, Dylan, Marah.",
        "Josh: Wow, you're going to go to all those places, huh? Alone?",
        "Reva: It's just you have a lot to do.",
        "Josh: When did you decide all this?",
        "Reva: I've been thinking about it for a while.",
        "Josh: First I'm hearing of it.",
        "Reva: Well, you know, I don't tell you every little thing every minute of the day.",
        "Josh: Doesn't make any sense, Reva.",
        "Reva: You've just been incredibly busy, Joshua.",
        "Josh: Well, yes, but you're the most important thing in my life, so...",
        "Reva: No. No, the veterans' project-- sweetie, come on, it's been taking up almost your whole days, you know? And that's... that's the right thing. You know, this is the biggest thing that's come along for Lewis Construction, not to mention Joshua Lewis. And you've got millions of little details you have to keep tabs on and all this momentum built up, and... you need that to focus on. You don't need to be wondering whether or not I'm around. I just... I need to start packing.",
        "Josh: Not so fast, Reva. You... you don't get to do this, okay? You don't get to pack up and leave. You need to talk to me. You need to tell me... please, what the hell is going on?",
        "Reva: You're reading way too much into this, sweetie. You are. I mean, sometimes a trip is just a trip.",
        "Josh: Unless you're pulling away from me again.",
        "Reva: What?",
        "Josh: Reva, come on. You weren't at the hospital fundraiser, you didn't make it to the TV interview, you pulled out of the trip to Chicago, the trip to san Francisco, I mean, it's...",
        "Reva: You know what? It's just there's been a lot going on with... with... Jonathan and everything.",
        "Josh: The pieces are not fitting into place, Reva.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, I'm just trying to get some things accomplished.",
        "Josh: What things?! Come on, help me out here. Just give me something, all right? You talking about the things on that list that you made when you were a child, you were a teenager? The stuff that you don't want me to help you with?",
        "Reva: You can't help me with this! You just... it's personal.",
        "Josh: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, it's personal. Am I overstepping my boundaries here, because I thought I was your husband, I...",
        "Reva: No, you just have to try to understand. I mean, the sooner I can get this stuff taken care of... the sooner I can be back here with you. I guess there's just no way I'm going to make you understand.",
        "Josh: No, Reva, actually, you know what? I understand just fine. I understand perfectly. It's quite simple: You're selfish.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: So what's going on?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, let's... let's just drop it.",
        "Blake: (Laughs) I don't think so, no, no, no. Not after that lead-in. You need to talk. What?",
        "Cassie: No, I think... you know, I shouldn't have even... I shouldn't have even mentioned it.",
        "Blake: Cassie, I've got to tell you something. I can seriously help. I have been in this situation, I can't even tell you. I mean, having the wrong feelings for the wrong guy. That was my whole life before Ross... during... if... that's what's going on?",
        "Cassie: In the biggest, most unbelievably inappropriate way.",
        "Blake: So... so who are we talking about? Billy?!",
        "Cassie: No. No... but you're close.",
        "Blake: Josh?! Are you saying you have a thing for Josh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: (Squeals) Stop it! I've got heels on! I've got heels on and I beat you! Ha!",
        "Coop: No! You did not beat me! You cheated! You tripped me and then you took off, so...",
        "Ava: Oh, whatever! Whatever.",
        "Coop: Ow, I think I busted my knee back there.",
        "Ava: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Okay, fine, so I... we're here...",
        "Coop: I'm okay, I'm okay.",
        "Ava: What are we doing here?",
        "Coop: Um, here. Well, Harley asked me to keep an eye on things and to look after her house.",
        "Ava: Well, it's too late, somebody already stole the walls.",
        "Coop: That's cute. That's very funny. Come here. You, my dear, are even cuter.",
        "Ava: Oh yeah?",
        "Coop: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ava: You'd better be careful. Remember there's no walls here; people might peek in on us.",
        "Coop: And...?",
        "Ava: I suppose we could fix that.",
        "Coop: Whoa, whoa, whoa, we can?",
        "Ava: Yeah. I mean, we're killer painters and spacklers, right? You got a busted-up wall? We're the ones to call!",
        "Coop: Oh, geez...",
        "Ava: You got a bedroom you need to make into a baby-ready nursery?",
        "Coop: Uh-huh.",
        "Ava: Oh... I'm sorry.",
        "Coop: No. No, don't worry about it.",
        "Ava: I didn't mean it, it just came out... I didn't mean to say that.",
        "Coop: I know, I know, I know, I know. Shh, it's okay, don't worry about it. Look, I know... that you're absolutely beautiful, and I know, and I've known, how much fun you are to hang out with. But... if we hadn't gone through all this baby stuff, all the drama, I wouldn't have known how generous a person you are. And how patient and also brave you are, too.",
        "Ava: I did it to make it easier for you.",
        "Coop: And it has been. It has been.",
        "Ava: So you have no regrets?",
        "Coop: No regrets. And I'm not looking back.",
        "Ava: Good. Good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Ow! (Screaming)",
        "Tammy: What's wrong with her, Doctor?",
        "Lizzie: It feels like the baby's coming, but it's too soon!",
        "Doctor: Braxton hicks; false labor.",
        "Lizzie: Well, make it stop! God, it hurts so bad!",
        "Tammy: Is the baby all right.",
        "Doctor: Yes, once we stop the contractions, there's no immediate danger.",
        "Lizzie: What's that?",
        "Doctor: It's a fetal monitor to track the baby's heartbeat.",
        "Lizzie: I just want Jenna to be okay. If I knew it was going to be this hard...",
        "Doctor: All right, would you like us to notify the father that you're here?",
        "Lizzie: No, that won't be necessary.",
        "Tammy: Yes, I'll call him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Jonathan Randall has left town.",
        "Beth: (Stutters) Alan, how do you know that? (Gasps) You made it happen, didn't you? (Laughs) Wait, wait, how does this help Lizzie get Coop back?",
        "Alan: It doesn't, but that's not my problem. Is it possible to get a glass of water in here?",
        "Beth: Alan, Lizzie specifically asked you to help...",
        "Alan: I know what she wants, but my main priority is her baby. That baby will be protected and want for nothing.",
        "Beth: Except a father! And what happens if daddy Jon decides he wants back in the picture.",
        "Alan: He won't. He's not coming back, ever again. Is it possible to get a slice of lemon with that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Please, don't call him, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: Why not?",
        "Lizzie: Um, well, for one thing, neither of us want to see him. Besides, the baby's fine now.",
        "Tammy: Well, that's... that's not exactly true. I mean, about me not wanting to see Jonathan. We aren't broken up.",
        "Lizzie: Then what are you?",
        "Tammy: Just... taking a little time apart.",
        "Lizzie: That isn't going to change what happened.",
        "Tammy: You should at least give him a chance to know what's going on.",
        "Lizzie: Why are you pushing this so much, Tammy? Why do you even care? This guy that you love so much made a baby with someone else.",
        "Tammy: I hate what Jonathan did. But I do love him. And your baby is part of him and he is part of her. So I have to call him.",
        "Lizzie: No, Tammy! Don't. Doctor Wills? I made a mistake, I just told my friend not to call the father. Um... I want the hospital to do it. There's his number. His name is Henry Cooper Bradshaw.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Cell phone rings)",
        "Coop: Mmm, hold on, hold on. (Panting) Hello? Yes. What happened? Is she okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Hi, it's Tammy. Is Jonathan there? I tried his cell, but I couldn't even get his voicemail, so I thought I'd try Outskirts. What?! No, I didn't know. Did he say where he's going? He took his passport?! Well, did he leave a note or a message...? Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Thank you.",
        "Beth: So you're telling me that you got rid of Jonathan?",
        "Alan: Yes, that's what I'm telling you.",
        "Beth: How? I mean, did you... literally get rid of him?",
        "Alan: Would you be upset if I said... yes?",
        "Beth: Would you be upset if I said... no?",
        "Alan: (Laughs) Let's just say I made Jonathan an offer he couldn't refuse.",
        "Beth: Oh, Alan, you gave him a choice?",
        "Alan: Don't worry, Beth.",
        "Beth: Well, I have to worry, because unless you shipped Tammy off with him, he will come back for her.",
        "Alan: No, he won't.",
        "Beth: How can you be so sure?",
        "Alan: You forget how persuasive I can be. Trust me, Beth, everything's under control.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Okay, it's not what you think, Blake.",
        "Blake: It's not? I mean, so... Josh is not the person you're in love with?",
        "Cassie: No, it is Josh, uh... but... it's not love.",
        "Blake: Oh, so he's just... you know wedged into your brain, in your head, and you can't get him out?",
        "Cassie: See, I knew I shouldn't have said anything to you.",
        "Blake: Oh, honey, it doesn't matter, it's all right. It's going to come out anyway. That's how love is.",
        "Cassie: I am not in love with him. I'm... I'm just... you know, he's been there for me, so many times. And he's always there to help. And I think I've just maybe gotten used to feeling him be so... supportive... or something.",
        "Blake: Or something.",
        "Cassie: Blake, you have to stop. Josh loves Reva, okay? And Reva loves Josh. And I love them both.",
        "Blake: Yeah, and...?",
        "Cassie: And... that's the way it's going to be! They're meant to be together-- I know that. End of story.",
        "Blake: Oh, honey, I'll tell you when it's end of story. Do you dream about him?",
        "Cassie: Occasionally...",
        "Blake: Do you think about him whenever you have a spare moment?",
        "Cassie: No. Not... not every spare moment.",
        "Blake: Josh walks into the room. You see his face for the first time, does your face... do this?",
        "Cassie: It doesn't mean anything.",
        "Blake: Uh-huh.",
        "Cassie: Blake, I cannot be in love with the man.",
        "Blake: I've got to tell you something. You're screwed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: So you're just going to take off, then? Minnesota, Oklahoma, France... wherever. To hell with what I think about it.",
        "Reva: I can't... not go, Joshua.",
        "Josh: Okay. I guess we have nothing more to say to each other, then.",
        "Reva: You can keep insulting me if you'd like.",
        "Josh: You'd better finish packing.",
        "Billy: Yeah, let's get a move on. Car's outside.",
        "Josh: You're going away with him?",

        "Kim Zimmer, \"Inside The Light.\" My daughter, Rachel, as I said, has graduated from college two years ago. And she's been taking her time figuring out what she wants to do with the rest of her life. And my son Max is finishing up his sophomore year in college and is going into... would like to go into sound engineering. My son Jake is acting, and doing very well. See Reva, Wednesday, June 28, \"Inside The Light.\"",

        "Josh: (Laughs) You're... you're going away with Billy?",
        "Billy: Hey, whoa. I'm just taking her to the airport.",
        "Josh: Right. Whatever. What's the first stop, I forget... Minnesota, right? You're going to go visit Dylan?",
        "Reva: Yes. Well, no... I just, I haven't really decided yet, because the story that I'm working on is at one end of the state, and then of course Dylan and Bridget are at the opposite end of the state, and...",
        "Josh: Right. (Laughs)",
        "Reva: It's a big state.",
        "Josh: Yeah, yeah. What else are you going to do while you're there, just out of curiosity? Are you going to... take in a Twins game, or shop at the Mall of America? Something like that?",
        "Reva: I really don't want to turn this into a fight.",
        "Josh: What the hell, Reva? Not only do you tell my brother about this epic adventure you're about to take, but you book a flight to God knows where before it even occurs to you to tell me what's going on! How am I not supposed to take that as a slap in the face?",
        "Reva: I'm sorry.",
        "Josh: Me too.",
        "Billy: Hey... it's not going to be that long.",
        "Josh: Thank you, I'll put that in my calendar. I appreciate that. Have a wonderful time. Wherever it is you're going, have a great trip, okay? You've got to do what you've got to do, right? Well, so do I. I have a life here, Reva. Right here in Springfield. As you pointed out, I've taken on the biggest project ever for me. And I thought you were going to be a part of that. Mistakenly, as it turnout.",
        "Reva: You know what I think about this project, Josh.",
        "Josh: I know... what you say ,but it's not the same as what you do. You have a plane to catch, right? Go! I'll see you... when I see you. Unless, of course, you decide not to come back.",
        "Reva: (Sniffles)",
        "Billy: Hey... come on. Sweetie, everything's going to be okay.",
        "Reva: He thinks I'm being selfish.",
        "Billy: Yeah, I know, I heard him.",
        "Reva: You think the same thing?",
        "Billy: Oh, come on. You've got the biggest heart on the whole damn planet. I do, however, think that you are going about this wrong, you...",
        "Reva: Oh, Billy, I can't tell him I'm sick. I can't tell him now, I can't! You heard him. He's in the middle of the biggest project of his life. And he needs it. And I need him to have it.",
        "Billy: But, supposing he never sees you again? What do you think he's going to think, he's going to think about this project? Every time he thinks about this project and he realizes that the last time he had an opportunity to spend time with you, he got mad and walked out. Come on. You know that'll kill him.",
        "Reva: I'm coming back, Billy. I'm coming home. I am. And when I do, I will tell Joshua everything. The whole story. Like you said, it's going to be okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Now, don't look at me like that. My life is not some plot line out of one of your novels. And it better not be. Besides, what I'm feeling for Josh is...",
        "Blake: Yearning. Need. Lust.",
        "Cassie: No, I... it's craziness.",
        "Blake: Uh-huh.",
        "Cassie: It's crazy! I am the one who kept pushing Josh and Reva to get back together again. Why would I do that if I were secretly hoping to have a thing with the guy?",
        "Blake: That is so easy. Because you were so busy trying to lock these two up as quickly as possible, and as tightly as possible... so it prevents you from making the moves on Josh yourself.",
        "Cassie: Wrong. Wrong, wrong.",
        "Blake: Honey, you said yourself that you are in love with him.",
        "Cassie: You said that. Not me. And even if I had said that... everyone loves Josh. What is not to love about Josh? He is the greatest guy in the world.",
        "Blake: Would you please call me if you need any help?",
        "Cassie: I'm fine. Everything's normal, and I am perfectly fine.",

        "Ava: What did they say about the baby?",
        "Coop: I don't know. I didn't ask what they said about the baby, all right? You know what, they must have called me by mistake.",
        "Ava: Since...",
        "Coop: Since... since I'm not the father of the baby. I mean, that's why... the people at the hospital must've looked at the old paperwork and haven't changed it over and... stupid place to keep some freaking rope.",
        "Ava: Are you okay?",
        "Coop: Yes. Ava, I'm fine, okay. It's just, this is not my child, okay? Which means none of this is my problem anymore. I just can't help but think that perhaps I should...",
        "Ava: Should what?",
        "Coop: Should call Cedars back and tell them to start calling Jonathan Randall as opposed to calling Coop.",
        "Ava: Do you want to go and see Lizzie?",
        "Coop: No. No, no, I don't.",

        "Coop: No, I...",
        "Ava: If you do, I understand. Okay?",
        "Coop: Ava, I am not into hurting you any more than I already have. Especially over a child that's not even mine in the first place. Oh, gosh! This is ridiculous! I'm having feelings like... I... oh!",
        "Ava: Like what, like you want to go and see Lizzie?",
        "Coop: (Sighs)",
        "Ava: I will go with you. Okay? I'll go with you. Let's go.",
        "Coop: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Tell me you didn't talk to Jonathan.",
        "Tammy: No. I didn't.",
        "Lizzie: Good. I so don't want him coming here.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan couldn't come even if you did want him to.",
        "Lizzie: What do you mean?",
        "Tammy: A manager at Outskirts told me that he left town.",
        "Lizzie: It was all too much for him.",
        "Tammy: What was?",
        "Lizzie: Everything. You, me, the baby... good riddance.",
        "Tammy: How can you say that, Lizzie? Jonathan's the father of your child. How could Jonathan just pick up and leave town without so much as leaving a note? Were would he even go?",
        "Beth: Lizzie? Lizzie, are you all right? Your grandmother called and said you'd been admitted.",
        "Alan: Did Tammy upset you?",
        "Lizzie: It was false labor, Granddad.",
        "Alan: After she upset you, I bet.",
        "Lizzie: She didn't do anything. I take that back. Tammy got me here. If it wasn't for her, it could have been really, really bad.",
        "Beth: Well, did the doctor say that you're out of danger?",
        "Lizzie: We're all better now. I can't wait to get out of here. I think Jenna hates hospitals. I know I do.",
        "Tammy: And as far as Jonathan goes, you don't have to worry about him poisoning Lizzie or the baby, he left town.",
        "Alan: Really?",
        "Lizzie: Yup. He bailed. Can't say I'm surprised.",
        "Alan: Walked out on his own child. Hm. I guess that fits his character very well, doesn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Hi. It's me. I'm at Cedars, I just brought Lizzie to the emergency room. But could you come over? I really need you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: The heartbeat sounds strong.",
        "Alan: Yes, that's no surprise to me. It's a beautiful sound, too, Elizabeth.",
        "Lizzie: Can you guys talk to the doctors and find out when I can get out of here?",
        "Alan: Listen, we don't want to rush things. You will stay in here as long as necessary.",
        "Beth: To keep the baby safe. You have to think about her.",
        "Lizzie: I am! All I do anymore is think about the baby! What about me?!",
        "Beth: We're thinking about you. Alan and I are going to make sure that you are happy and healthy.",
        "Alan: Absolutely.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, well, then I'm 0 for 2 today.",
        "Alan: Well, then I guess we're going to have to cheer her up. Because a contented mother makes for a robust baby.",
        "Lizzie: Mm, we're back to the baby again. You really want to make me happy? Help me get Coop back.",
        "Beth: We already promised that we would, sweetie.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, yeah, I don't see anything happening.",
        "Alan: I don't think you should focus so much on young Henry.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, I want him, Granddad. And I need a hand getting him. The baby can take care of herself.",
        "Alan: Well, I don't think that is true, or you wouldn't be here, Elizabeth. Now... if you ladies will excuse me, I'm going to go talk to Dr. Wills.",
        "Beth: Honey, I'm... I'm going to get you some fresh water. I'll be right back. Coop!",
        "Coop: Hello, Beth. Is Lizzie in there?",
        "Beth: You... you came to see her?",
        "Coop: We heard that there is a problem with the baby.",
        "Ava: Is she okay?",
        "Beth: Oh, she'll be so glad to see you. Go, go! Go in. I'm sorry, Ava, only one visitor at a time. Hospital rules, something about germs.",
        "Ava: It's okay. Go ahead.",
        "Coop: You sure you don't mind?",
        "Lizzie: You know, I can't really deal with anybody right now, so just go, okay?",
        "Coop: Hey, no problem.",
        "Lizzie: Coop, don't you dare leave this room.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Okay, so I brought the extra set of blueprints. Oh, I also have this memo from the... planning commission. This coffee is just so weak. What... what did Blake have to run out of here so quickly for?",
        "Cassie: Um... I don't know.",
        "Josh: She had a pretty funny look on her face, I thought.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, it seems to be going around.",
        "Josh: What does that mean?",
        "Cassie: Well, this going on here is not your normal expression.",
        "Josh: Yeah, I just, I have a lot on my mind right now. You know, 4th of July is coming up pretty quick, and there's a thousand things that we haven't done yet, so... we need to get on it.",
        "Cassie: Okay, well, I thought things were pretty much under control.",
        "Josh: No. Things are not under control at all. In fact, here, I made a list. We've got to, um, reschedule the meeting with the Congresswoman. We've got to file final residential plans, print up some programs, send out press... could I get some milk over here, please, Lynn? Thank you very much. Uh... just a lot of logistics for the event itself that we still have to hammer out.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, well, that part I thought Reva was going to handle.",
        "Josh: No. No, Reva is not... um... she had to go out of town. Unexpectedly, which is a word that, um... I seem to be using in reference to Reva a lot these days. Where's that other... where's something else here, that other thing...",
        "Cassie: Okay, just... just stop. Josh. Are you telling me that Reva just... she just left? To go where?",
        "Josh: A lot of places.",
        "Cassie: Her timing is kind of weird...",
        "Josh: Yeah. Tell me about it. I wish I could explain... more to you, but I can't, because I don't really understand it myself. I just know that, um... I can't sit around and wait for her, because I've got a lot of things to do. We, we in fact have a lot... it's just me and you now, Cassie, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: You know, there is one good thing about going to Minnesota.",
        "Billy: Oh yeah? What's that?",
        "Reva: I can ditch the wig! It's not exactly summer wear.",
        "Billy: It's a little itchy, is it?",
        "Reva: Yeah. But I do have alternatives, you know. You never know, they just might have some kind of a talent show at that clinic. And I might have to pull out my Tina Turner outfit.",
        "Billy: (Laughs) Damn you, Reva...",
        "Reva: What?",
        "Billy: How come this doesn't make you mad? I mean, I'm so mad at your disease right now, I could kick the living stuffings right out of it...",
        "Reva: It does make me mad. It makes me furious. But what good is that going to do?",
        "Billy: It will keep you fighting.",
        "Reva: That's the right answer. Because I'm not ready to give up on this thing yet, Billy. And that bag wouldn't be sitting right there if I planned to take this lying down.",
        "Billy: Well, that's the way to talk there, pilgrim.",
        "Reva: Yeah, I'm a real tiger.",
        "Billy: Yeah, come on. Let's go.",
        "Reva: Grrr! (Laughs) Just one minute, I just want to take a last look around. Not that I don't know this room and everything in it. Just reminds me exactly what I'm fighting for. Think he'll wait for me?",
        "Billy: Oh, hey. He's waited his whole life for you. What's a few more weeks? He'll wait.",
        "Reva: Right. What's a few more weeks?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Lizzie, you, um... you look good.",
        "Lizzie: How can I look good? I'm in a hospital bed.",
        "Coop: I'm just saying that you look... you know... healthy.",
        "Lizzie: You should have been here an hour ago. It wasn't pretty.",
        "Coop: Is that the baby's heartbeat?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. It's going really fast because Jenna's really excited that you're here. So's her mom.",
        "Coop: Ah, well, um... I'm glad that you're okay.",
        "Lizzie: Is that why you came? To see if I was?",
        "Coop: Lizzie. When I heard that something was wrong, I felt I had to come over.",
        "Lizzie: That's nice to hear.",
        "Coop: You know, it is weird. After everything that's happened... I just can't seem to shake the feeling that this is my baby. Even though I know that it's not.",
        "Lizzie: Well, maybe it's because we're meant to be together. The three of us.",
        "Coop: (Sighs) I, um... I just wanted to check and make sure that you're okay.",
        "Lizzie: I went into false labor.",
        "Coop: Yeah, I heard.",
        "Lizzie: You know, as bad as the pain got... I wasn't really afraid for my sake. I was terrified at the thought of losing this person that means the world to me.",
        "Coop: But I thought you said the baby was basically out of danger?",
        "Lizzie: I was talking about you, Coop.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Honey?",
        "Tammy: Oh, thank you for coming!",
        "Cassie: Baby, I got... I got your message, what happened? You had to bring Lizzie to the ER?",
        "Tammy: She's okay now. But Jonathan's gone.",
        "Cassie: Gone? Gone gone?",
        "Tammy: He packed up and left town. I just found out.",
        "Cassie: Well, without any... warning?",
        "Tammy: None. He just... went.",
        "Cassie: Wow. Uh, I have to admit I used to pray that Jonathan would leave Springfield, but it's the one thing I was pretty sure he'd never do.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, well, I didn't think he'd sleep with Lizzie ever. But he did. When I was in there, she seemed so real.",
        "Cassie: Lizzie?",
        "Tammy: The baby. He didn't just leave me. He left her too.",
        "Cassie: Honey, um... I know you love him. And I know you probably want to work things out with him, even now. Am I right? And I'm not going to try to stop you, but... sweetie, you've got to think about this. Okay, I mean this is the guy who says he loves you, and then he gets another girl pregnant, he leaves town... leaving you, this other girl, and his unborn daughter? I mean, you've got to ask yourself, if this were anyone other than Jonathan... or if this were happening to a friend of yours, and she was hooking up with a guy who could do this kind of thing...",
        "Tammy: I'd never stand for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Bon soir, beautiful lady. (Laughs) Yeah, that's the perfect thing to say to your father. Thank you, I appreciate that. How are you, Marah, my darling? No, I'm just calling to say hi. I understand your mom's coming for a visit. She didn't say anything to you about...? Did she say anything about... paying a visit to Dylan? Really? Not a word, huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Hey. You're going to be coming back here real soon. Real soon.",
        "Reva: Do me a favor? Put that in a prayer or two?",
        "Billy: Darling, I already have. Night and day.",
        "Reva: I'm going to beat this thing, Joshua. And when I do, you're going to be my next stop.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Mallet: Calm down.",
        "Dinah: No! You cheated on me and I hate you!",
        "Mallet: God, can you blame me? You're nuts!",
        "Marina: Meet me at my place. Alan-Michael.",
        "Frank: Look at her all you want. It's... a nice place to raise a family.",
