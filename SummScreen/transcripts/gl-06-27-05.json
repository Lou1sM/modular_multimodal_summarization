        "Harley: Gus? ",
        "Gus: You miss me? ",
        "Harley: What is going on out there? I was \r\nterrified. ",
        "Gus: Somebody must have tipped off the cops. \r\nThey're all over the place. It\u2019s only a matter of time until this place is \r\ncrowded. ",
        "Harley: I think whoever it is, is already in \r\nthe studio. ",
        "Gus: We're going to be good. ",
        "Harley: Gus? I was thinking we should split \r\nup and go in opposite directions. ",
        "Gus: Don't start again, please. ",
        "Harley: We'll be harder to find. ",
        "Gus: I haven't come this far with you to \r\nleave now. ",
        "Harley: Gus, please. ",
        "Gus: No! ",
        "Harley: Listen to me. You know I'm right \r\nabout this. We'll go out there and we'll find each other again when we're safe.\r\n",
        "Gus: I'm so in love with you. (Doors rattle) \r\n(Gunshot) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ",
        "Harley: Gus? Gus? Gus? Gus? Oh, my God. What \r\ndid you do? ",
        "Gus: I've waited so long for this. \n",
        "Harley: Too long. ",
        "Gus: Yeah. ",
        "Harley: Well, they say that anticipation \r\nis... ",
        "Gus: What? ",
        "Harley: Highly overrated. ( Laughs ) \n",
        "Gus: That's my girl. I agree. ",
        "",
        "Guard: Anthony Camaletti Mallet. Car keys. \r\nWallet containing $23. One photo. You travel light. ",
        "Mallet: I've got everything here that matters \r\nto me. ",
        "",
        "Cassie: What? ",
        "Jeffrey: You just called me Richard. \n",
        "Cassie: No, I didn\u2019t. ",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, you did. ",
        "Cassie: Are you sure? Because I have baby on \r\nthe brain and... ",
        "Jeffrey: Trust me. Trust me, you did. \n",
        "Cassie: This is crazy. I didn't call you \r\nRichard. Why would I call you Richard? ",
        "Jeffrey: I don't know. ",
        "Cassie: Edmund was here earlier, and he was \r\ntrying to make me doubt myself, Jeffrey, and he was saying a lot of things, \r\nand... ( Knock at door ) we're not expecting anyone, so I should probably just \r\nget the door. Hey, Dinah. Wow. It's good to see you. ",
        "Dinah: It is? ",
        "Cassie: Uh, sure. What's going on? How's the \r\nbaby? ",
        "Dinah: Well, it's funny you should ask, \r\nactually. I came here to warn you. When this baby is born, you may not be able \r\nto see it. ",
        "",
        "Jonathan: Worthless? After all the tears and \r\nthe shouting, is that what we're down to, Mom? That I'm still worthless? \n",
        "Reva: I didn't say that. ",
        "Jonathan: You didn't have to say it. I see it \r\nin how you don't trust me and how you choose everyone else, including yourself, \r\nover your own son. ",
        "Reva: No. That's what you want to believe.\r\n",
        "Jonathan: Why would I want that? ",
        "Reva: Because it makes it easy on you. \n",
        "Jonathan: Oh... ",
        "Reva: If you believe that nobody cares, then \r\nyou don't have to. ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Cue the Dr. Phil theme music.\r\n",
        "Reva: So what are you going to do with that \r\nknife? Does it make you feel like a big man? What are you going to do with it?\r\n",
        "Jonathan: Oh, I'd like to cut through all the \r\ncrap you've been feeding me about family, about loyalty. ",
        "Reva: It's all true. ",
        "Jonathan: Liar. I was useful to you. You used \r\nme to get over your guilt. You used me to get out of your boring life. \n",
        "Reva: No. You're more than that. ",
        "Jonathan: What am I? Am I the good company \r\nemployee for the family business? Am I your partner in crime when you feel like \r\ncutting loose? ",
        "Reva: You're my son. ",
        "Jonathan: What does that mean? Reva! Who am \r\nI? Who am I to you? I want to know what you really think of me. Be honest, Mom. \r\n(Traffic noise)",
        "",
        "Gus: Wow. Wow. ",
        "Harley: Wow. Wow. I mean... I mean, it was \r\nalways... you know? But when you... ( Giggles ) ",
        "Gus: Yeah. ",
        "Harley: Yeah. I mean, wow. ( Laughs ) \n",
        "Gus: You said that already, baby. ",
        "Harley: Maybe we were wrong about the whole, \r\nyou know, anticipation thing. That was important. ",
        "Gus: Believe me, I'm not going to wait that \r\nlong again for this. You know, the last time... the last time we had sex was, \r\nlike, two days before we were supposed to get married. Or what would have been \r\nour wedding, you know? ",
        "Harley: I remember. But this was like that \r\nnight. I mean, it was... this could have been our wedding night. This could have \r\nbeen any night when we were free. ",
        "Gus: Well, soon. Okay? Soon. ",
        "Harley: I don't know how it's going to be \r\npossible, being on the run. Always looking over our shoulders, waiting to be \r\ncaught. ",
        "Gus: You and me and the boys are going to \r\nhave a new life. A brand-new life, and that's just perfect with me. ",
        "Harley: Me, too. ",
        "",
        "Reva: You won't believe anything I say \r\nanyway, so what's the point? ",
        "Jonathan: Why should I believe you? You're \r\njust as messed up as I am. ",
        "Reva: You think so? ",
        "Jonathan: I know it, because I see it. Reva, \r\nwhat are you doing here, at this bar, with him? ",
        "Reva: That's not your problem. ",
        "Jonathan: No, but it's yours, because you're \r\ntrying to hang on to whatever little piece of life you have left. ",
        "Reva: Is that the best you can do? Calling me \r\nold? ",
        "Jonathan: You have everything you could have \r\never wanted. You have the husband, the life, the kids. Does that make you happy? \r\nNo. Does that make you want to run the hell out and go flirt and cheat with some \r\nstranger in a bar? ",
        "Reva: Stop. ",
        "Jonathan: What is your fixation with me? What \r\nis that? Are you trying to recapture your youth? ",
        "Reva: Stop. Stop. ",
        "Jonathan: Reva, it's gone. It's gone. \n",
        "Reva: I said stop! ",
        "Jonathan: The doctor told you it's gone, \r\nremember? She gave you... ",
        "Reva: Oh, my God! Oh, my God, Jonathan. ( \r\nSobbing ) Oh, my God. ",
        "Jonathan: No. That's good. Now I see how \r\nsimilar you and my abusive father really are. ",
        "Reva: No, no, I shouldn't have done it. I \r\nshouldn't have. I'm sorry. But we can't keep going on like this. Please let me \r\nhelp you, because we need help. We need help. ",
        "Jonathan: You mean I need help? ",
        "Reva: No, but I want to help you but I can\u2019t. \r\nThere's not enough of me. I just... I don't know why my life isn\u2019t... \n",
        "Jonathan: What do you want, Reva? What the \r\nhell do you want? Do you want the good boy who works for Lewis? Do you want the \r\nupstanding citizen that gets along with the rest of the kids? You don't even \r\nknow, do you? I was never good enough for Alfred, and I'll never be good enough \r\nfor you. ",
        "Reva: No. ",
        "Jonathan: Yes. ",
        "Yes. I don't act the part, I don't look the \r\npart. Well, maybe that's the problem. Maybe if I looked more like your son, I \r\ncould be a son to you. Maybe if I looked more like Shayne, hm? A son that you \r\ncould really love? Huh? ( Sobbing ) ( Screams ) Is this better, Reva? \n",
        "Reva: Stop. ",
        "Jonathan: ( Crying ) Is this better? Do I \r\nlook more like your son now? Am I less worthless? Huh? ",
        "",
        "Dinah: Edmund is threatening to keep this \r\nbaby away from you. ",
        "Cassie: Why would he do that? He wants us to \r\nraise it together. ",
        "Dinah: Well, he's beginning to lose hope, and \r\nif all fails, his backup plan is to make sure that he raises the kid by himself.\r\n",
        "Cassie: Okay, why are you here helping me, \r\nDinah? ",
        "Dinah: Ow. Oh. The baby's kicking, right in \r\nthe bladder. ( Laughs ) Ow. You know, I'm sorry, I think that I've interrupted \r\nsomething here. I know the two of you are in the beginning of whatever's going \r\non between the two of you, so I'm sure you have a lot to deal with. ",
        "Cassie: Dinah, you don't have to leave, okay?\r\n",

        "Gus: Did you hear something? ",
        "Harley: What was that? ",
        "Gus: I don't know. Maybe it was the morning \r\ncrew. Remember, they usually show up around this time. I don't know what to...\r\n",
        "Harley: Okay, we've got to get going. \n",
        "Gus: Listen, I'll check it out. I'll see what \r\nit is. Make sure it's safe, okay? ",
        "Harley: Yeah. You should go. ( Cell phone \r\nringing ) Hi, Mallet. ",
        "Mallet: You're not safe where you are. \n",

        "Mallet: I know you're in New York. \n",
        "Harley: How? ",
        "Mallet: You've got to get out of there and \r\ncome meet me. ",
        "Harley: Meet you where? ",
        "Mallet: Anywhere. We can go back to \r\nSpringfield to find the real killer, or try to get you out of the country.\r\n",
        "Harley: Mallet, Mallet, Mallet. Wait, what \r\nare you doing? ",
        "Mallet: I'm trying to protect you. I'm not \r\ngoing to lose you again. ",
        "Harley: Listen, Gus and I have it handled.\r\n",
        "Mallet: You don't understand what kind of \r\ndanger you're in right now. Now, whatever you do, stay on the line, okay? Just \r\nin case. ",

        "Reva: No. No. Not for me. ",
        "Jonathan: Yes. Yes, it's for you. It was all \r\nfor you. First it was for dear old dad, and now it's for you, because you're the \r\none who's trying to fix me. ",
        "Reva: What did he do to you? ",
        "Jonathan: Nothing that you haven't tried.\r\n",
        "Reva: No. No. I am not your father. All I \r\never wanted was for you to be a part of the family. I wanted to... I wanted to \r\nhave a chance to love you. ",

        "Mallet: Is this Aitoro's idea? Why don't you \r\nlet me help you? ",

        "Jonathan: That's too bad. ",
        "Dinah: Why is that? ",

        "Jonathan: Why are you pretending to be \r\npregnant? ",
        "Dinah: I have my reasons. This baby has been \r\nmy hold on Edmund, and as long as he believed I had a child growing inside of \r\nme, he trusted me and he listened to me. ",
