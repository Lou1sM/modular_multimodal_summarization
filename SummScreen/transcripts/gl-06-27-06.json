        "Dinah: Honey?",
        "Mallet: Mm?",
        "Dinah: I never knew I could be this happy.",
        "Mallet: Ah. And we have the rest of our lives to enjoy it.",
        "Dinah: Honey, you can let me up now.",
        "Mallet: Oh, sorry. It's just that Harley looks so hot in that dress.",
        "Dinah: Harley? This our wedding day. How could you still be obsessed with Harley?",
        "Mallet: No, no, I'm not obsessed.",
        "Dinah: Ow! You stepped on my foot.",
        "Mallet: Next time why don't you move out of the way a little faster, honey.",
        "Dinah: Well, next time, why don't you pay a little bit more attention?",
        "Mallet: You know, you're awfully klutzy for someone who was raised by a circus.",
        "Dinah: Circus? I told you, I was raised in a carnival. Like ten times I told you. Where I developed some very important skills like knife throwing.",
        "Mallet: Whoa! Would you put the knife down?",
        "Dinah: No.",
        "Mallet: Put the knife...",
        "Dinah: Make me.",
        "Mallet: Put the knife down.",
        "Dinah: No!",
        "Mallet: Calm down!",
        "Dinah: No! You cheated on me and I hate you!",
        "Mallet: God, can you blame me? You're nuts!",
        "Dinah: I'm not nuts! And I don't know what I ever saw in you!",
        "Mallet: What did I see in you? I have no idea! Drop it!",
        "Dinah: Don't... ow! (Shriek) Honey?",
        "Mallet: Hey.",
        "Dinah: You okay?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, no, I'm fine, fine. I'm fine, I just... I kind of had a weird dream.",
        "Dinah: Me, too. What was yours about?",
        "Mallet: Um... those, you know, those threatening notes I got. Why, what about you?",
        "Dinah: Just naked in gym class again. (Laughs)",
        "Mallet: (Laughs) Well, honey, that's not a nightmare for teenage boys like myself. It's a dream come true.",

        "Olivia: Morning.",
        "Frank: Hi.",
        "Olivia: Hi.",
        "Frank: My God, look at you. You are so beautiful. I could look at you forever. And ever, and ever, and ever. (Laughs) I have to get going.",
        "Olivia: What?",
        "Frank: Yeah, I'm sorry.",
        "Olivia: (Laughs)",
        "Frank: I know. One more, though. (Laughs)",
        "Olivia: You're a tease.",
        "Frank: Oh, yeah. I promised pop that I would help him out with the morning shift, so... anyway. But we're... we're still good for later on, right? You, me, and Emma, dinner and movie, right?",
        "Olivia: Sounds wonderful.",
        "Frank: Good, good. Actually, you're the one who's wonderful.",
        "Olivia: Frank? Do you still have that brochure, the one with the gated community?",
        "Frank: Oh, Morningstar Estates? Yeah, why?",
        "Olivia: I just want to have another look at it, see what the houses are like.",
        "Frank: Really? Well, um... I just happen to have it right over here. You can look at it all you want. It's a nice place to raise a family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: All right, just like they say in narcotics anonymous... one, uh... (laughs) What do they say? One job at a time... no, one day a time. One job at a time.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, that's one day at a time.",
        "Gus: That's what I'm thinking, one day at a time. I'm kidding, I know that, thank you.",
        "Buzz: Decaf?",
        "Gus: That's... don't mind if I do. Perfect.",
        "Buzz: You here often?",
        "Gus: Well you know, lot to be done. A lot to be done, and I don't have the right tools.",
        "Buzz: You know, I bet if Harley knew that you were drug free, she'd come back home. Why don't I tell her?",
        "Gus: Because I only have like a week and a couple of days. I just think maybe if I have two weeks, she'd be more...",
        "Buzz: Okay. Can't argue with that logic.",
        "Gus: Yeah. Oh, you know what, I have to do something. I totally forgot. Are you going to be around?",
        "Buzz: Yeah, I'm going to hang with you all day. No, I'm just kidding, I've got a bike here. I'm going to go hit the road.",
        "Gus: Well, I can't say I blame you. I'll see you back here. Let's, make sure we lock up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Oh, I have so much to do today. Oh, honey! Did I show you this? This is a wedding planning workbook. Everything that we need to know about being married is right in here.",
        "Mallet: Well, I've got news for you, sweetie. We already know everything that we need to know. Don't we?",
        "Dinah: Okay, we can't do this again?",
        "Mallet: Oh, why not, I think we can.",
        "Dinah: No, no, we really can't.",
        "Mallet: It's too late, we've already done it.",
        "Dinah: No, we're not doing it! We're not doing it. Come on, I'm the bride!",
        "Mallet: Why not?",
        "Dinah: Because! I'm the bride! We've got a wedding to plan. Besides, you've got to fill it out.",
        "Mallet: What is this?",
        "Dinah: This is a personal profile. It is meant to identify the most appropriate wedding style for our personalities and tastes.",
        "Mallet: (Laughs) Oh, boy.",
        "Dinah: Oh, come on, don't be such a guy.",
        "Mallet: Really? I really have to fill this out?",
        "Dinah: Yes, sweetie. This is going to save us a whole bunch of time. Now come on. Don't delay, fill yours out today.",
        "Mallet: (Laughs) Okay, okay, okay, I'll do it. Matter of fact, you know what? I'll take it down to the station, ask the guys for their input. Guys, guys, grilled salmon and champagne or hot dogs and a beer keg.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Remy: Wow. Some guy just wasted a lot of money.",
        "Marina: Yup.",
        "Remy: Anyone I know?",
        "Marina: Don't ask. Actually, Remy? Can we talk, um... interrogation techniques?",
        "Remy: Flowers, interrogation techniques? I can't keep up with you. All right, go for it.",
        "Marina: Okay. Say you have to question somebody.",
        "Remy: A suspect?",
        "Marina: Yeah, and you know him pretty well. And so it's... it's hard to put the screws to him. And you're conflicted about it, and you're concerned because he knows you so well, he might sense your anxiety and totally shut down on you. So what's your approach?",
        "Remy: I think instead of fighting the fact that I know and like this dude, I'd use it to my advantage.",
        "Marina: How?",
        "Remy: Remind him what pals we are and confide in him that it's really killing me to have to question him like this. And it is, right?",
        "Marina: Definitely.",
        "Remy: So use the truth, and you'll seem sincere. He'll think you're on his side, and then maybe he'll tell you something that he wouldn't have otherwise.",
        "Marina: You know, that might just work.",
        "Remy: I'm not going to regret giving you this advice, am I?",
        "Marina: Oh...",
        "Remy: What is this case, anyway?",
        "Marina: No, no. No case, just... a hypothetical question. Thanks again.",

        "Gus: Frank? Can I talk to you?",
        "Frank: Yeah. What's up?",
        "Gus: Remember how you said when I was ready to get my job back, you know, to come and talk to you? Well, I'm ready.",
        "Frank: Uh, so soon?",
        "Gus: Well, I know that it seems like it's soon...",
        "Frank: Well, it is soon. A little too soon.",
        "Gus: Well, yeah, but Buzz doesn't seem to think so.",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, Buzz isn't the Chief of Police.",
        "Gus: Yeah, but still, he doesn't think so, and he thinks I'm ready, and I think I'm ready.",
        "Frank: Okay, Gus, look. How long has it been since you've been off the pills?",
        "Gus: Uh... a little over a week.",
        "Frank: A week. All right, well, that's good. Good for you. But let's have this conversation... when it's been, like, over a month, okay?",
        "Gus: Frank, I need to get my life back, okay?",
        "Frank: No, I think what you're trying to say is that you want to get my sister back. And you think I'm going to help you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: I'll see you later.",
        "Dinah: Mm-hmm. Okay. \"First, tell us a little bit about yourself. Where did you grow up? Small town, big city?\" What does it matter, people move around. Oh, okay. Well, all right, well at least somebody has had to move around more than I have, so maybe this will work out. (Whispering) Dinah, stop making yourself an outsider. Stop. (Knock on door) Hold on. Whoa! Hi! (Laughs) Welcome back. (knock at the door)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: Marina. Wow, you look great. Come on in. I was beginning to think you weren't going to show up.",
        "Marina: And yet here I am. Nice. Now you think you're going to ply me with champagne and... what? Let me guess. Of course, chocolate covered strawberries.",
        "Alan-Michael: They are your favorite.",
        "Marina: I know they're my favorite. All right.",
        "Alan-Michael: Come on.",
        "Marina: I know.",
        "Alan-Michael: Just admit it already. We're meant to be together. It's fate.",
        "Marina: No. I don't believe in fate, Alan-Michael. And I don't believe in fancy promises, either. I believe that actions speak louder than words, so if you really want me, it's time for you to prove it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Hi. My car broke down, and I was trying to call for a tow truck, and I...",
        "Buzz: But your phone didn't work because there's... I heard.",
        "Olivia: Yeah.",
        "Buzz: You okay?",
        "Olivia: Yeah. Yeah, clumsy, but I'm good. Thanks.",
        "Buzz: Um, you know, uh, you could hop on my bike, I can take you into town or wherever you want to go.",
        "Olivia: Wait a minute, I finally get a ride on the Buzz-mobile? I'm honored.",
        "Buzz: What do you mean, finally?",
        "Olivia: You never asked me before.",
        "Buzz: Well, I didn't think you were interested. You know? What's this? Morningstar Estates. Hmm, nice houses. This yours?",
        "Olivia: Frank wants to buy a place and move in together.",
        "Buzz: Ooh, whoa.",
        "Olivia: It's a home, Buzz. It's a real home. And Emma deserves that, and so do I.",
        "Buzz: Of course she does. So, I assume you said yes.",
        "Olivia: No, not yet.",
        "Buzz: What's the holdup?",
        "Olivia: Well, I look at these pictures, and I love the porches, and the yards with the swing sets, but my eye keeps going to... (sighs)",
        "Buzz: What?",
        "Olivia: No, never mind.",
        "Buzz: Tell me.",
        "Olivia: The fences. There are fences everywhere, and it's like people are being locked up or held in.",
        "Buzz: Yeah.",
        "Olivia: They're pretty to look at, I'm just not a fence person.",
        "Buzz: I'm not a fence person either.",
        "Olivia: I know.",
        "Buzz: So tear down the fences. It might sound crazy, but you know, in your heart, you know what makes you happy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Fine, Frank. Look, I'd like to get my family back, so... I need to know if you're going to help me.",
        "Frank: I can't do it, Gus. Not yet.",
        "Gus: Well then when?",
        "Frank: I don't know when. You had a substance abuse problem which affected your performance on duty. And your partner was also injured as a result. Look, I.N.S. hasn't even completed their investigation. And you know what, you've been sober, what, a week?",
        "Gus: So put me on desk duty, then.",
        "Frank: I don't need another detective doing desk duty. I need you out in the field.",
        "Gus: Exactly, Frank. You need me in the field.",
        "Frank: Yeah, but that would mean partnering you up with another detective. And the only detective that needs partnering right now is Mallet. And he would have to be okay with that. And trust me, that's going to need a lot of convincing.",
        "Gus: Hey, partner. Long time no see.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Come on in. I'm glad you're back.",
        "Harley: Well, I'm not officially back. My kids are still in Europe with my family. I just, um...",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Harley: Dinah, are you and Mallet...",
        "Dinah: We're planning a wedding. (Laughs)",
        "Harley: Congratulations.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, yeah. It's a little harder than I thought. Being engaged, planning a wedding. You know? We have to agree on what we don't agree on, and I don't know. I guess that's what marriage is about, right? Negotiating and compromising.",
        "Harley: No, don't... don't worry about all the small stuff. Just try to focus on the love part.",
        "Dinah: I'm trying to. Hey, enough about me. Have you seen Gus at all. No?",
        "Harley: No, uh... I mean, I want to. You know, I miss him. I do miss him. But I went into this thing with the tough love approach, and I've got to stick that out. But that's why I'm here, actually. Because I knew that I could come to you, and that you would give me the straight scoop. How is he? I mean, is he together at all? Is he still a mess?",
        "Dinah: Well, uh... it was a little rough going there for a while. He was a wreck. He, um... got behind the wheel while he was high and he had an accident. Honey, listen, it's... it's okay. It's okay, I think something good came from that. I don't know what, but I think it was a wake-up call for him. He quit the pills.",
        "Harley: Cold?",
        "Dinah: Well, from what I can tell, he's really towing the line. And, you know, I know it doesn't sound like much, but I... I know he's determined.",
        "Harley: He is that. I wish that I could believe that things were going to be different this time, I just...",
        "Dinah: Honey, listen to me. What you did, that tough love thing, that worked. That worked. He knows that if he does not get his act together, you will walk out of his life for good.",
        "Harley: Then I should go back to Europe.",
        "Dinah: No.",
        "Harley: Yes, I should go back to Europe if it's working.",
        "Dinah: That is not what I'm saying.",
        "Harley: I need to give him space to continue to do what he needs to do.",
        "Dinah: Honey. Harley, let me tell you something. That worked up until now. I know how Gus is feeling. He is feeling alone. He is feeling desperate to make some kind of connection and make sure that the woman he loves still cares about him. But honey, he is turning a corner and I know he is. And in order to make it all the way through, he is going to need your attention. And your love. And your support. Oh, honey, he needs you.",

        "Kim Zimmer, \"Inside The Light.\" No, it's never really been explained. It was a pet name that Reva had for him, and I'm sure it came from, you know, Reva, when she 13, going... \"okay...\" I used to, I mean, I still call Robert \"Budhead.\" You know, whenever I have to say \"Bud,\" I always add the \"head\" in rehearsal. \"Budhead.\" And I have a feeling that's what Reva probably did as a kid. You know, instead of saying, \"your posterior head,\" she would say, \"You're a budhead.\" You know, and it got shortened to being an affectionate term. \"Bud.\" (Laughs) See Reva, Wednesday, June 28, \"Inside The Light.\"",

        "Alan-Michael: You know I want you, Marina.",
        "Marina: Then prove it.",
        "Alan-Michael: I already have. Harley publicly humiliated me. Practically ran me out of town. But I came back. I came back for you.",
        "Marina: You came back for Spaulding as much as you came back for me. Maybe even more so. You practically said so yourself the other day when we... you know.",
        "Alan-Michael: You know?",
        "Marina: Will you stop smiling? It's not funny. I'm trying to pour my heart out to you, and you're laughing!",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, it's just... you're so cute when you're upset.",
        "Marina: You want to see cute? I'm even cuter when I'm walking out the door.",
        "Alan-Michael: Hey, whoa. What is going on with you?",
        "Marina: I am trying to tell you, and you are not listening.",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm sorry. Talk to me.",
        "Marina: When I first met you, I fell for you right away. It freaked me out, because I sensed from the start that I shouldn't trust you, and yet you played me really well and I fell for you...",
        "Alan-Michael: I did not play you.",
        "Marina: Please! You were going after me and Spaulding at the same time and you neglected to tell me about it.",
        "Alan-Michael: Okay. Mea culpa. Go on.",
        "Marina: I get that you want that company. Okay? I get that you feel that it's your birthright. But you hurt me, Alan-Michael. And I didn't deserve it.",
        "Alan-Michael: No, you didn't.",
        "Marina: What guarantee do I have that you're not going to hurt me again? The answer is, I don't. Not as long as I'm in competition for your heart and soul. So that competition has to end. You have to make a choice. Do you want the company, or do you want me? Because the truth of the matter is, you can't have both.",
        "Alan-Michael: What are you asking me to do?",
        "Marina: Forget about your dream of running Spaulding Enterprises. Give it up, for me.",

        "Frank: Hey, beautiful. I was just calling to see how your day was going. I was just thinking about you, and um... just wanted you to know that I was really looking forward to seeing you and Emma tonight. And listen, if you want to bring that brochure, we could maybe pick out some paint colors, or... just kidding. Anyway, I will be talking to you later.",

        "Buzz: Oh, I think you can. I may be biased, but I think Frank's terrific. I think you're terrific, too.",
        "Olivia: Well, you think too highly of me. If you really knew me...",
        "Buzz: I know you. That's why I think highly of you. What's wrong?",
        "Olivia: I'm just in a mushy mood today, that's all.",
        "Buzz: Oh, can't have that. Somebody might, you know, walk by and think you have a heart.",
        "Olivia: You do know me. So, um, can I still get a ride on this thing? Back to town?",
        "Buzz: You have to wear a helmet, you know. You think hat head is bad, wait 'til you see helmet head.",
        "Olivia: Oh, you know, it's a heavy price to pay for a ride back to town, but I think I can hack it if there's a reward waiting on the other end.",
        "Buzz: Such as?",
        "Olivia: My very own Buzz Burger? (Laughs)",
        "Buzz: Oh, you're on. You ever ridden one of these before?",
        "Olivia: I've ridden scooters in San Cristobel.",
        "Buzz: Well, this is sort of the same principle. You sort of just, you know, get on behind me and hang on. Tight. No, wait, I need my arms.",

        "Gus: I know you overheard my conversation with Frank, so you know what I'm going to ask you. See, he thinks that I can get my job back if you vouch for me.",
        "Frank: Oh, no, no. I didn't say that. There's the whole matter with I.N.S.",
        "Gus: Frank, I'm just saying that it would be a lot easier, right, if I... if I have him as a partner, I would get reinstated, right? If he was the partner.",
        "Mallet: Right, so I go to the brass, and I tell them even though I got shot, I don't hold a grudge, and even though you were high as a kite on the street, and I nearly lost my life over it... I tell them, \"Hey, we're cool.\"",

        "Dinah: (Laughs) Well, maybe it's my mixed up perceptions from my previous relationships, but... you know, when Mallet and I were on the outs, I wanted to run, too. I didn't even want to stick around; I wanted to give up. I think because putting it back together, and the hard work that you need to do is so painful. It doesn't feel good. But the idea of losing that person was a lot worse to me.",
        "Harley: I saw him today. At the house. Our house. He didn't know I was there, I hid. (Laughs) But I watched him work. And that's what he does. He just works and works and gets nothing done. (Laughs)",
        "Dinah: But he does it for you.",
        "Harley: I should go.",
        "Dinah: I want you to call me.",
        "Harley: Oh, I will. I will. But, um... do me a favor, Dinah? Just don't tell anybody that I'm back in town yet, because I just... kind of want to do this on my own right now, okay?",
        "Dinah: You got it.",
        "Harley: (Laughs) Dinah Marler's getting married.",
        "Dinah: Oh! (Laughs) Yeah.",
        "Harley: Congratulations. I mean it.",

        "Olivia: So, what's next? Are we going to go bungee jumping or parasailing or...",
        "Frank: Well, uh... how about some lunch?",
        "Olivia: Hi!",
        "Frank: Hey, how are you?",
        "Olivia: Good.",
        "Frank: So, uh, you... you guys went for a little ride, did you?",
        "Olivia: My car broke down on Olmstead Hill Road and your dad was there.",
        "Buzz: Fortunately, I was nearby.",

        "Olivia: Mm-hmm.",
        "Frank: So are you up for some lunch?",
        "Buzz: Oh yeah, she is. She wants a Buzz Burger with everything on it. But since I'm off the clock until noon, somebody else has to make it. Have fun, guys.",

        "Marina: There is no middle ground, that's the point.",
        "Alan-Michael: I would never ask something so huge of you.",
        "Marina: You already have. You've asked me to give up my loyalty to my family, to Harley. I will not do that.",
        "Alan-Michael: Marina, if I do this for you, I'll be miserable. I'll regret it the rest of my life. I'll be thinking of what might have happened if I'd gotten my shot. You're asking me to respect your right to be a Cooper. Well, you have to respect my right to be a Spaulding, too. And part of that legacy is the company.",
        "Marina: Just stop. All right. I get it. I understand how this is, all right? But you are dreaming if you think you're going to actually get that company back. Please, you can't even make it through security. Harley fired you, remember?",
        "Alan-Michael: Like that matters.",
        "Marina: Well, you're going to need to be able to get in. And you're not in cahoots with Alan anymore, I mean at least from what I know, so... you have no leverage, Alan- Michael.",

        "Frank: (Laughs)",
        "Olivia: I like that.",
        "Frank: Yes, it is a little sneaky, but, um... you know, isn't this the house that has the fence around it that you don't like?",
        "Olivia: Oh, we can tear the fence down.",
        "Frank: You know there's something very interesting about a nice solid fence. And that is that it keeps the bad guys out and the good guys in. I mean, there's absolutely nothing wrong with security. And um, I mean it kind of gives you a nice sense of freedom.",
