        "edmund: I've just got one more box out in the car, and then i'll head back to town.",
        "Cassie: Oh. I thought you might stay.",
        "Edmund: This is your place, cassie. And you should probably decide where everything goes. Expecting company?",
        "Cassie: Oh, that's tammy. Hey, you need some help there?",
        "Tammy: No, I got it.",
        "Edmund: Hi.",
        "Tammy: I didn't know you were going to be here.",
        "Edmund: Well, i'm just helping your mother with the move.",
        "Tammy: Oh.",
        "Edmund: Yeah. One box and I'll head back to town. Excuse me.",
        "Tammy: Yeah... Right. I knew it.",
        "Cassie: Wait. Knew what? What is wrong with you? What's your problem?",
        "Tammy: This move. That's what. This whole thing is a big mistake, and you know it.",
        "Cassie: I do not. I thought you liked the farm, tammy.",
        "Tammy: That doesn't mean i want to live here now. I'm sorry, mom, but we might as well be on mars, we're so far removed from everything.",
        "Lizzie: Whoa, nice catch.",
        "Joey: Okay. Don't sneak up on me like that again. (Both laugh)",
        "lizzie: Sorry to keep you waiting.",
        "Joey: No problem. This stuff looks old, huh? I think my mom would like this.",
        "Lizzie: Very old actually. 17th century, I believe.",
        "Joey: No way. I must say, this place is like a museum. So, ready to go?",
        "Lizzie: Actually I was thinking, why don't we stay here? Because no one's home, and we could have the place for ourselves.",
        "Joey: I don't know, lizzie. Your grandfather wants us to come up with product design for spaulding. So i was thinking we should be out there at the mall talking to people.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, we could search on the web that way, and i have the internet in my room.",
        "Joey: Lizzie, come on, let's be out there.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, you're probably right. That's why you cannot say no to this.",
        "Joey: I don't get it. Tickets to the summer fling.",
        "Lizzie: Two of them, two of us. \"Out there,\" right?",
        "Sandy: Yeah, I was pretty sure we both said tonight. No. Marina, no. Hey, it's no big deal. Just tell my brother that he owes me big time. A progress report... I don'T. Yes, boss. I'll have it for you tomorrow. All right. What now?",
        "Buzz: All dressed up and nowhere to go.",
        "Sandy: Mr. Cooper, howdy. Not exactly dressed, though.",
        "Buzz: It's a figure of speech.",
        "Sandy: Your granddaughter stood me up.",
        "Buzz: Oh.",
        "Sandy: We're partners in the spaulding summer internship.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, she told me. Yeah, right. She's having a lot fun with you.",
        "Sandy: Yeah, she's quite fun herself.",
        "Buzz: So you're keeping alan on his toes?",
        "Sandy: That's the plan. Some of the kids are a little intimidated though.",
        "Buzz: By the great and powerful alan spaulding?",
        "Sandy: Yeah, I don'T... But marina, she's not afraid to stand up to him.",
        "Buzz: I think she gets that from me. Boy, it's good to see her laugh again. It's good to see her having a good time. She's overdue. You must be a good influence on her.",
        "Michelle: Back off. It's just... Get out, all right?",
        "Danny: No.",
        "Rick: Michelle...",
        "Michelle: I can't give you the answers that you want, all right?",
        "Danny: We're sorry. We didn't mean to overwhelm you.",
        "Rick: Take it easy.",
        "Danny: We didn'T.",
        "Rick: We're just trying to help you.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, i know what you want. I know. All right? And I can't give it to you. And as soon as i know who I am, you guys will be the first to know.",
        "Rick: All right.",
        "Bill: Michelle, michelle, we didn't mean to upset you.",
        "Danny: We just... We just keep hoping that if we come up with the right memory or the right question, everything will click into place for you.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, right. For you! For you, you mean, right? Oh, okay, let me guess. That was a real non-michelle thing to say.",
        "Tony: Hey. What's with the attitude, michelle, huh? Who do you think you are giving these guys a hard time?",
        "tony: It's okay. This is crazy, michelle. Knock it off. I'm serious. Knock it off.",
        "Michelle: I'm having an identity crisis here. Do you mind?",
        "Danny: Tony.",
        "Tony: Do you trust me? Do you trust me? These guys, michelle, these guys are not out to get you, all right?",
        "Michelle: Okay. So what do you suggest i do? Just fake remembering to make everybody happy?",
        "Tony: You know what? Yeah. It might be a way to get them off your back, yeah.",
        "Michelle: All right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm being a real pain.",
        "Danny: No, don't apologize. It's okay. Really.",

        "Tony: You're going home?",
        "Michelle: Yeah, the doctor says i'm ready.",
        "Danny: But how do you feel about it? Are you ready?",
        "Michelle: You know, i think that i just need to change.",
        "Danny: All right, okay. Take your time. Just take your time. We'll be outside. Okay?",
        "Tony: Yeah, all right.",
        "Michelle: Tony?",
        "Tony: Yeah?",
        "Michelle: Can you stick around for a second?",
        "Tony: Yeah, sure.",
        "Sandy: So you and alexandra spaulding.",
        "Buzz: (Moans)",
        "sandy: Ah. You guys been together a long time?",
        "Buzz: We've been friends a long time. The other not so long.",
        "Sandy: Ah. Is that the way to go? Start out as friends, get to know each other?",
        "Buzz: I guess that would be one way to go. You've got a girlfriend?",
        "Sandy: Not at the moment.",
        "Buzz: You know, when I was your age, I had a little boy and a wife.",
        "Sandy: Wow. I can't imagine. I don't think I could handle that much responsibili at this point.",
        "Buzz: I think you'd be better at it than i was, which isn't saying much.",
        "Sandy: Hey, the little boy... Frank?",
        "Buzz: The one and only.",
        "Sandy: Oh, good work. He's a great guy.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, he's the best guy in the world, but I didn't have much to do with that. I left him as a little boy, and we only got to know each other again when he was grown.",
        "Sandy: And how did that go, getting to know each other again?",
        "Buzz: That took time. He gave me a shot, and i think it word out pretty well. It was tough on him and harley.",
        "Sandy: Harley. Hey, there's another card, huh? And I mean that in a nice way.",
        "Buzz: (Laughs) she's one of a kind. They're both great. It just took me a long time to figure out that my family meant the world to me.",
        "Sandy: Everyone around here seems so family-oriented. Even the spauldings.",
        "Buzz: That would be one of the very few things the coopers and the spauldings have in common.",
        "Cassie: You will get used to living here. I promise.",
        "Tammy: You will maybe.",
        "Cassie: Oh, come on. This is a home for us. We were at the beacon way longer than i ever intended. And your little brothers need a yard, tammy.",
        "Tammy: They like the park.",
        "Cassie: We were so crowded there.",
        "Tammy: We weren't crowded. There were lots of people at the beacon. You know, I liked it that way. All I had to do was go out the front door, and I saw lots of people that I know, lots of people that I wanted to see.",
        "Cassie: All your friends can come here and visit anytime they want.",
        "Tammy: Why would they want to?",
        "Cassie: Okay, you are acting like we are out in the middle of nowhere, and that is not the case. So you will get used to this place, okay? And we're going to have a great time here.",
        "Tammy: It's not like I have a choice. It's already a done deal. I have more stuff to go get out of the car.",
        "Cassie: Gee, why didn't i see this coming? I thought she would love this place, but obviously not. No, she doesn'T. Of course not.",
        "Edmund: So what are you going to do about it?",
        "Cassie: I guess i'm just going to keep talking to her until I can... I don't know... Make it work.",
        "Edmund: May i give it a try?",
        "Cassie: I thought you said that you had to leave after that box?",
        "Edmund: Suddenly I'm very thirsty, and i could use something cold to drink before i leave.",
        "Cassie: Well, i can take care of that. I have somlemonade in the cooler in the other room. Send up some smoke signals if she gets too difficult, okay?",
        "Edmund: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: Thank you.",
        "Tammy: Where's mom?",
        "Edmund: She's in the back.",
        "Tammy: She asked you to talk to me, didn't she?",
        "Edmund: No, no, i volunteered. I have an idea why you may be so upset about leaving the beacon and moving out to this beautiful farm.",
        "Tammy: Don't stop now.",
        "Edmund: All right. The problem is not the move. The problem is joey.",
        "Joey: You're asking me to the dance?",
        "Lizzie: Well, it's not like it's a date or anything.",
        "Joey: Okay, what's your spin on it?",
        "Lizzie: I think it will be a great research opportunity, one we really can't afford to pass up.",
        "Joey: Yeah, i can.",
        "Lizzie: What do you mean? You're the one who said we need to get \"out there.\" I mean, what better time? The whole... Half the school's going to be there.",
        "Joey: I kno lizzie. They're going to be there to party, not to answer survey questions we haven't even come up with yet.",
        "Lizzie: Yes, but we will. And it will take no time. Just say yes and we'll get it all done.",
        "Joey: I don't think so.",
        "Lizzie: Why? The other groups are going to be there. Kyra and shayne and sandy and marina, they're all going to be there.",
        "Joey: And tammy and remy. I know.",
        "Lizzie: Joey, we can't just give them the advantage. You want to win this, don't you?",
        "Joey: Yes, lizzie. It's just weird, okay? I was planning on taking tammy to the dance.",
        "Lizzie: Look, i know this has really hurt you and tammy, but i just was hoping this was going to help you forget.",
        "Joey: Forget? How? By watching tammy all night with some other guy?",
        "Lizzie: Well, i'm not even so sure that she's even going to go.",
        "Joey: Look, lizzie, it's not just about tammy, okay? There's something else i wanted to tell you.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, well, tell me.",
        "Joey: It's about the project. You know, it's cool and everything, but I kind of just wentlong with it.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, what's wrong with that?",
        "Joey: I need to earn money this summer. That's what's wrong. And if i don't get a job, I'm going to have to work while I'm taking classes next year. I'm sorry, lizzie, but i need to make some real money and get a job no",
        "bill: You think she's ready to go home?",
        "Danny: She can't hang out here in limbo forever.",
        "Bill: Well, then you'd better make the transition as easy as possible.",
        "Danny: Yeah, yeah. I got it covered.",
        "Rick: All right, all right. All right. That's enough. We all want the best for michelle, right?",
        "Danny: Yeah, I wish she'd realize that.",
        "Rick: That's not possible at this point, danny. She's completely overwhelmed.",
        "Danny: Yeah, all right, you're right. So what do i do? Help me out here. What am I supposed to do, or not do, when i get her home?",
        "Rick: Keep visitors to a minimum, and spend as much time together in that house as possible until she feels comfortable.",
        "Danny: Yeah. Comfortable with me.",
        "Bill: What about robbie?",
        "Danny: No. He's staying with ross and blake right now.",
        "Bill: You're not going to tell her that she has a son?",
        "Rick: That plan's on hold for a while.",
        "Bill: What are you going to do when she seesll the stuff in her house?",
        "Danny: The stuff is packed up and stored away, and his room is locked. They can't see each right now. It'll be too much for both of them.",
        "Rick: All right, let's get these forms filled out and let's get michelle out of here, okay?",
        "Danny: (Sighs)... Yeah.",
        "Michelle: If I don't get my act together, all these nice people are going to take a hike.",
        "Tony: That's not going to happen, michelle. It's not. We love you. And we're here for the long haul, all right? I just want you to do me a favor. Don't push yourself. Please? Just let this all take it's course. Let it happen naturally. Because it will.",
        "Michelle: And what if it doesn't? What if I never become tt person they want me to be?",
        "Tony: What do you mean? If you change? Michelle, it doesn't matter if you change. Everyone's going to adjust.",
        "Michelle: Everyone?",
        "Tony: Yeah. And if they don't, you know what? It's their problem. It's not yours. Okay? I'll see you outside.",
        "Danny: Thanks. Hey.",
        "Tony: Hey.",
        "Danny: Thanks for coming over.",
        "Tony: Oh, please, danny, don't thank me. How are you? You okay?",
        "Danny: Yeah, I'm great. My wife trusts you more than she trusts me. I mean, what's your secret?",
        "Edmund: You've lived at the beacon ever since you started seeing joey, so leaving the beacon's like leaving joey.",
        "Tammy: Oh, you're way off, uncle edmund. Joey and i aren't even seeing each other. And even if we were, there are lots of reasons why we shouldn't move here. Joey has nothing to do with them.",
        "Edmund: Well, whatever the reasons are, tammy, they must be pretty important or you wouldn't be so upset.",
        "Tammy: I'll handle it. So i guess you're leaving? Since you're not buying into mom's big plan.",
        "Edmund: Plan?",
        "Tammy: You know, the plan to make us one big happy family out here on the farm. See? You're just like me. You don't want it either.",
        "Edmund: Well, it's not that i don't want it, tammy.",
        "Tammy: Well, what is it? Mom is not going to be happy until the two of you are together. And having us live out here and you living in town isn't going to make it any easier for you two to hook back up.",
        "Edmund: Where your mother lives, tammy, doesn't affect my relationship with her.",
        "Tammy: Places have histories, you know. Especially this place. Never mind. You know what? Let's just forget it, okay?",
        "Edmund: All right, if that's what you want.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, I'm going to go find mom and say good night.",
        "Edmund: Tammy, tammy, i know you think I'm way off base about this whole joey thing, but i have an idea that can make him a regular visit at the farm if that's what you like.",
        "Tammy: I don't exactly see that happening.",
        "Edmund: Well, there's always a lot of work to do around the farm, and joey could make quite a bit of money over the summer doing some of that work if you think he could use the money.",
        "Tammy: I know he could, but he won't do it. I mean, I'll be here.",
        "Edmund: Oh, but theob may be just the thing he needs as an excuse to see you.",
        "Tammy: You think so?",
        "Edmund: Well, it's worth a shot. If you want to see him, that is.",
        "Tammy: I do. You know, I do. Thank you, uncle edmund. Thank you for thinking of that.",
        "Lizzie: Joey, how could you givep on it like this? Did you forget the first prize, the full scholarship, the four years of college paid, already?",
        "Joey: Yes, lizzie, I know. I have a one in six chance of winning, okay? I'm sorry to let you down, but you're not going to have a problem finding a new partner, trust me.",
        "Lizzie: No. I don't want a new partner, okay? There has to be some way we could work this out.",
        "Joey: Lizzie, give it up.",
        "Lizzie: No. There has to be some kind of part-time job that you can make good money and we can still be together.",
        "Joey: Lizzie, there's no part-time job that's going to allow me to just call the shots on my hours.",
        "Lizzie: Well, then work here.",
        "Joey: Doing what, dusting the antiques?",
        "Lizzie: No, my grandfather was saying how unhappy he is with the company that's cleaning our pool and taking care of our hot tub. So take it over.",
        "Joey: Lizzie, i don't know the first thing about pool work.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, it's nothing. You just have to skim the top of the pool every couple of days, like every day in the summer. But then you just have to check the chemicals in the hot tub. And grandpa always overpays his people. This is the perfect solution. Come on.",
        "Joey: Okay. All right. I can call your grandfather's office and...",
        "Lizzie: No, i'll talk to him for you. Don't worry about it.",
        "Joey: No, lizzie, i don't think...",
        "Lizzie: What, you don't trust me?",
        "Joey: Um...",
        "Lizzie: Listen. I'll take care of the job. It's as good as yours. You've got the money, you can still work on the project. Come here. This is all going to work out. Just stick with me, okay? I promise you.",
        "Danny: Look, tony, michelle obviously feels more comfortable around you. All I do is make her feel cornered.",
        "Tony: No, danny, I don't think so, you know. I'm not as connected. You know, there's less pressure for her, you know.",
        "Danny: Yeah, I know, but also she trusts you.",
        "Tony: Maybe because i'm the one she remembers.",
        "Danny: Right. Because u saved her life. You are her only link between the past and now. I need you to help me out here and just make yourself available. At least until she starts to get her memory back, okay? Will you do that for me? Tony:Eah, i can do that.",
        "Danny: Thank you. There she is. Hey, hey.",
        "Michelle: Hey, so can we do this?",
        "Danny: You look great. You look trific.",
        "Michelle: Oh, thanks. It's really pink.",
        "Rick: So you guys want to...",
        "Michelle: I guess i'm ready to say good-bye.",
        "Rick: Yeah. Well, just for now.",
        "Michelle: You know, i might not remember you as my brother, but, you know, as a doctor, you kept me alive. So that's a plus, right?",
        "Rick: That's real sweet, michelle. Listen, I'm going to see you soon. I'll see you soon, okay?",
        "Bill: Do I get one of those?",
        "Michelle: Oh, why not? I'm passing them out. Um, thanks. Thanks for the flowers and all the nice thoughts and everything, thanks.",
        "Bill: Any time.",
        "Michelle: And you, don't be a stnger, okay?",
        "Tony: I won't. You take care, all right? Okay?",
        "Michelle: Okay.",
        "Danny: Okay. Ready to go home?",
        "Michelle: Yes, let's do it.",
        "Danny: I got it.",
        "Lizzie: Coming up on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Cassie: And i know that we can be happy and we can be together here.",
        "Danny: Would you be more comfortable if tony were around?",
        "Michelle: That would be really great. You wouldn't mind that?",
        "Danny: Absolutely. I can talk to tony.",
        "Joey: We're friends, lizzie, okay? You don't have to try so hard to get me to like you. I already do. jacksontoday at 5 \u00f1 \u00f1 C#c c \u00f1 ( \u00f1 \u00f1 T \u00f1 \u00f1 \u00e7 ?P ? \u00e7 Cg c \u00f1 H K \u00fa \u00d1 # & \u00d1 K \u00f1 \u00d1 \u00f1 X",

        "Edmund: You still have to clear this with your mother.",
        "Cassie: Well, i don't think that'll be a problem.",
        "Tammy: You heard?",
        "Cassie: I think i heard enough. So are we okay on this?",
        "Tammy: Yeah. I'm sorry I was so down on you before about the move.",
        "Cassie: I know. It's okay. Remember the last time we moved in here? We thought that was it, you know, this would be the last stop.",
        "Tammy: Things happen.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, but i always promised myself that you and your brothers, you know, would have a good home, a stable life, tammy.",
        "Tammy: Oh, mom, we have that. You've always given us that. I should go back to the hotel and pick up the rest of my stuff.",
        "Cassie: Yes.",
        "Tammy: Are you going to be here when I get back?",
        "Edmund: Probably not.",
        "Tammy: Maybe I'm not the only who has stuff to work out about the farm.",
        "Cassie: Uh, tammy?",
        "Tammy: Can I help it if i want you to be together? Come on, whatever it is, just work it out.",
        "Cassie: All right. Go pack, okay? Let's go. Good-bye.",

        "Edmund: Well, tammy seems to think this place is going to be a roadblock for us.Li",
        "cassie: Did she say that?",
        "Edmund: Well, she says it has a history. You want to clue me in?",
        "Cassie: Why would i do that when it might push you further away?",
        "Lizzie: So what do you think? About the pool? (Laughs)",
        "joey: Right, the pool. Well, it's an olympic-size pool, so it's going to be a lot of work. And then there's the jacuzzi. I don't know, lizzie. It's a lot of maintenance.",
        "Lizzie: You can handle it.",
        "Joey: I guess i can. But we have to ask your grandfather first.",
        "Lizzie: No, first we've got to give it a test run. I figured we'd go for a swim and check out the hot tub. I didn't get changed for nothing.",
        "Joey: Great. Lizzie, we should probably work on the project though.",
        "Lizzie: No. Work first, project later. Here, catch.",
        "Joey: What is this? Some type of pool boy uniform?",
        "Lizzie: It's just extras we have for guests. You can change out in the pool house, and i'll see you out there in a minute, okay?",
        "Joey: Whoa, lizzie, wait. Hold on.",
        "Lizzie: What?",
        "Joey: Can you do me a favor? Don't try so hard.",
        "Sandy: Hey, you know what you were talking about earlier, about relationships and starting out as friends?",
        "Buzz: Yeah.",
        "Sandy: Has it always happened for you like that?",
        "Buzz: Sometimes love creeps on you slow and nice and easy and, you know, like from a friendship. Other times it comes like a bolt of lightning. My advice would be, go with it.",
        "Sandy: All right. Do you have a secret to your success with miss spaulding, other than the family and friendship things?",
        "Buzz: A secret? Our secret is that we know tha it's a waste of energy to have a secret, so we tell each other anything, anything at all. That's our secret.",
        "Sandy: Hmm.",
        "Bill: Hey. I thought I saw you head back here.",
        "Tony: Hey, bill. I just... I figured michelle might...",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Tony: ...Want these. They're good pictures.",
        "Bill: Right. Well, some day maybe. There not much use to her now, except yours, of course.",
        "Tony: Yeah. That's going to change when e gets her memory back, so...",
        "Bill: I guess it makes sense. You're the one she remembers. You pulled her out of the warehouse.",
        "Tony: It was a lucky break, bill.",
        "Bill: Look, tony, i know i didn't say this before, but thank god you were there. Really. I mean, those reports are making you out to be a hero. This rescue's made people sit up and take notice.",
        "Tony: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Bill: You know what that means: Opportunities open up for you in this town.",
        "Tony: Time will tell.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, especially in business. Like that project I was talking about on fifth street. I mean, if you're interested, I...",
        "Tony: I could be.",
        "Bill: All right. Well, we should talk about it sometimes.",
        "Tony: You want to talk?",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Tony: All right, good. How about right now?",
        "Bill: That's great.",
        "Tony: All right, let's go. So i have been conjuring up my own project, one you might want to get in on.",
        "Bill: What kind of project?",
        "Tony: Renovation. Out with the old, in with the new.",
        "Danny: Welcome home.",
        "Michelle: This is our place?",
        "Danny: Actually, no. This is the guesthouse. We live in a much bigger house right behind here.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, right. This is... This is like graceland.",
        "Danny: What? You remember graceland? I mean, elvis? Do you...",
        "Michelle: I saw it on tv in the hospital. So... So you must do okay. I mean, you can afford all this kind of stuff, right?",
        "Danny: Well, we've never starved.",
        "Michelle: Oh, whose idea was it to buy this house?",
        "Danny: Mine. Ever since you were a little girl, you've been in love with this house. You did all the decorating.",
        "Michelle: Don't tell me, I'm the interior designer and a physician's assistant.",
        "Danny: No, no. You just... Decorating was just something that you enjoyed. So, well, what do you think?",
        "Michelle: Um, i... It's impressive, you know. I really didn't know what to expect.",
        "Danny: Well, we can change anything you don't like.",
        "Michelle: Don't push the panic button, you know? I'm just a little... A little surprised by my taste, you know, in a lot of things.",
        "Danny: Right. Curtains... Husbands.",
        "Michelle: Oh, husbands? Now I've got more than one? Just kidding.",
        "Danny: Me, too. So do you want... Do you want the grand tour of the whole place? Or do you...",
        "Michelle: No, no. Maybe later. Maybe later.",
        "Danny: Sure, whatever. Take your time. Take your time. Yeah, actually this room was the first room that you worked on, that you decorated, everything from the paint to everything you see. It was your idea. You had a very, very clear vision of how you wanted everything to be. It was almost like a natural instinct.",
        "Michelle: An instinct, huh?",
        "Danny: Mm-hmm.",
        "Michelle: Then why don'i feel that now? Why don't I feel anything?",
        "cassie: Tammy's right. The farm has history, good and bad.",
        "Edmund: I remember you telling me that R.J.'S father, hart, was shot here.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, that was pretty horrible. For tammy and for all of us.",
        "Edmund: Yeah, i can imagine that something like that would haunt her.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, but it's not just the bad memories that scare her; it's the good ones, too, edmund. She has memories of richard here and our life together.",
        "Edmund: Oh.",
        "Cassie: But we have memories here, too. And that's what I thought about when you brought me here and i saw all the love that you put into this place. I mean, you gave me a home. You gave me a home for me and my kids. Don't you see that's why i'm here? And I know that we can be happy and we can be together here.",
        "Edmund: Without being haunted by history?",
        "Cassie: We have our own history. And it started that afternoon in the hayloft when you told me you love me. Edmund, I thought we'd be together forever.",
        "Lizzie: I just wanted us to have a little fun, that's all.",
        "Joey: Putting the sews to your grandfather so he'll give me a job; presenting me with this little bathing suit, or whatever you want to call it: These are bribes, lizzie. Thanks, but no thanks.",
        "Lizzie: You know, what's wrong with me trying to help you get some money and have fun at the same time?",
        "Joey: We're friends, lizzie, okay? You don't have to try so hard to get me to like you. I already do, job or no job. So just ease up, okay?",
        "Lizzie: I'm sorry. So does this mean we can still do the project together?",
        "Joey: Yes, yes, we can still do the project together. Work is work. We could do it right now.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. So go put on some music, any kind you want. Just pick it.",
        "Joey: Music to work by coming right up. Wait a second. I've got it.",
        "Lizzie: What?",
        "Joey: The project. The project that we could pitch to your grandfather. It's a winner. It's a total winner.",
        "Tony: You know, i've got to tell you, bill, I like the hotel idea, I do. But I see a whole city... Whole city development thing happening.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, i like the way you think.",
        "Tony: Well, you know, i've got the power, the influence to make it happen. Why not go for it? You're interested?",
        "Bill: Well, i've got one question for you.",
        "Tony: What's that?",
        "Bill: How does danny fit into this?",
        "Tony: He doesn'T.",
        "Bill: Well, then I'm interested.",
        "Tony: All right, good. Good. Well, we have one thing that we need to discuss before we move forward. I saw josh the other day, and he told me he's got some concerns about lewis construction.",
        "Bill: About me, you mean, right?",
        "Tony: Olivia told him that you pulled a gun on me.",
        "Bill: If you're afraid I'm going to go crazy or something...",
        "Tony: No, i'm not afraid. I can handle myself, bill.",
        "Bill: All right, good then.",
        "Tony: Don't worry about that. But what i don't want is josh or your father interfering with you and I when we're doing this project. Do you understand that?",
        "Bill: Tony, that's not going to happen, all right? They know I'm running lewis construction. They're not going to mess with it, all right? So relax.",
        "Tony: All right, good. As long as we got that straight.",
        "Bill: No problem.",
        "Tony: All right. Looks like i got myself a contractor.",
        "Bill: That's right.",
        "Danny: Michelle? Michelle, there is no pressure, none, to... To remember anything, feel anything. Forget it. Just... You know, relax, relax, relax. Have a good time. Enjoy the house.",
        "Michelle: Whoa, whoa, what's not to enjoy? I mean, you know, it's beautiful.",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Michelle: So did we have fun here?",
        "Danny: Yeah, of course, we did. Of course.",
        "Michelle: What did we used to do?",
        "Danny: We watched a lot of movies and had friends over for dinner. You liked to dance in here a lot. You would just put on the stereo.",
        "Michelle: So why don't we try that? Why don't we play some music",
        "danny: Great. Okay, yeah, sure, sure. Great. That's a good idea. Let's see.",
        ">Ichelle;: You know, this is a really big house for only two people.",
        "Danny: Huh? Yeah. Well, we haven't always lived here alone.",
        "Michelle: What are you trying to tell me? We take in borders?",
        "Danny: No, no, not exactly. There's tony and...",
        "Michelle: What? Tony lives here? Why didn't he tell us? He could have come home with us.",
        "Danny: Well, he useto live here. He doesn't live here now.",
        "Michelle: He probably lives in that bigger house behind this one, right?",
        "Danny: No, actually, he... He lives out of town on a horse ranch, and he also rents a room, or keeps a room, at the beacon hotel.",
        "Michelle: So do we have any other tenants that i have to worry about?",
        "Danny: No. Well, there was nico. He's this kid who you kind of took under your wing. It's a long story. He moved out a while ago.",
        "Danny: Would you feel more comfortable if tony were around?",
        "Michelle: Really? I mean, that... That would be really great. You wouldn't mind that?",
        "Danny: No, no. If that works best for you, I... Absolutely. I can talk to tony, I guess.",
        "Michelle: You know what? No, no. No no. This is our house and it was just us, right, before, you know, the accident. So that's what we should do. It should just be us.",
        "Danny: Okay, well, you don't have to decide right now. Just think about it. I'll mention it to tony and we'll see what happens, okay? Um, I'll be right back. (Sighs)",
        "Joey: Okay, so check this out. You're in a jacuzzi or a pool, whatever, and your music ends, okay? What do you do?",
        "Lizzie: You get out and change it.",
        "Joey: Okay. But if your cd player, boom box, mp3 player, whatever it is, floating in the tub with you, bam! All you've got to do is reach over, grab another cd, pop it in and instant music.",
        "Lizzie: That's a great idea. But do you think we'll be able to get it to work?",
        "Joey: Yeah, of course. They have waterproof watches, waterproof camping gear, waterproof sunscreen.",
        "Lizzie: No, you wait. You know what? I see it now. We can make them in, like designer colors. Like hot pink and neon green...",
        "Joey: Lizzie, lizzie, ease up, okay? Let's work on the technical problems first.",
        "Lizzie: No, seriously. That's a great idea. I told you we'd make a great team.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, i still love you. You and your children are the first real family I've ever had. The reason we're not together...",
        "Cassie: But we are together, edmund. Don't you see that? You didn't have to help me move in here, but you did. You didn't have to step in and talk to tammy for me, but you did. Being together comes naturally for us. We can work through whatever problems we have. I know we can.",
        "Edmund: We can't make it, cassie, without trust.",
        "Cassie: I trust you, okay? I trust you. I made a mistake, edmund.",
        "Edmund: Look, maybe... Maybe it was a warning. Maybe it was a warning that we just can't escape our past, who we were, everything that happened, everything that i didn't...",
        "Cassie: No, uh-huh. You know what? I don't buy that. Not when there's love. Not when there's forgiveness. Can't you forgive me?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, there's no reason to forgive you. I have no reason to forgive you. You have every reason to doubt me. Erything. I just don't want to see that look of fear and suspicion in your eyes again and know that i w s the cause of it. And can you promise me that's never going to be there again?",
        "Cassie: Maybe we can just put this part of the discussion on hold and just concentrate on the love, edmund. Just maybe. Just maybe we could be gazing into each other eyes over breakfast in the morning. What do you say?",
        "Tony: I'll tell you what? Give me a call. And we'll set up a time to do a walkthrough, all right?",
        "Bill: All right. How about tomorrow afternoon?",
        "Tony: All right, good.",
        "Bill: Good.",
        "Tony: Listen, one other thing. What we discussed the other day about the unions?",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Tony: Fifth street? Don't you worry about it. It's taken care of.",
        "Bill: Thank you.",
        "Tony: Yep.",
        "Billy: So since when are you and tony drinking buddies?",
        "Bill: Strictly business. Dad, we're just closing a deal.",
        "Billy: Doing business with a santos?",
        "Bill: Well, last I checked his name was cleared.",
        "Billy: No, danny' hey, just watch it. You know, you do business with the devil, he brings you down.",
        "Bill: Okay, okay, dad. Thanks for the vote of confidence.",
        "Billy: Hey, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait. Can't we... Can't we disagree on business, son?",
        "Bill: You know, i just... I can't take getting the third degree every time I'm trying to do business. All right, i'm running lewis construction. I think the track record should speak for itself.",
        "Bill: It does, it does. All right, it's wonderful.",
        "Bill: Then good.",
        "Billy: Well, look, how many times I got to tell you and uncle josh i'm fine? Work is fine. I'm on top of my game. Things are great.",
        "Billy: Whew! Your apartment doesn't say that to me.",
        "Bill: What are you talking about? You went into my apartment?",
        "Billy: Yeah.",
        "Bill: What, are spying on me? This is unbelievable.",
        "Billy: Josh, wanted me to check you out. Hey, you trashed the place.",
        "Bill: Dad, I lost my fiancee. I knocked a few things over. Big deal. So what?",
        "Billy: Well, maybe you're just not ready to make decisions right now.",
        "Bill: No, no, dad. Things have never been more crystal clear to me. I know what I want and i'm after it, all right? So just get off my back.",
        "Michelle: That's nice. The music is nice.",
        "Danny: Yeah. Glad you like it. I'd ask you to dance... But I'm a little rusty.",
        "Michelle: How about a drink?",
        "Danny: That's a great idea. You know, I have this amazing bottle of wine that I was saving for, you know, to celebrate.",
        "Michelle: That's perfect.",
        "Danny: Okay.",
        "Michelle: Perfect.",
        "Danny: All right, i'll get it.",
        "Michelle: What is going on here?",
        "Danny: This is a rioja from spain.",
        "Michelle: What's this? Don't tell me we have children.",
        "Edmund: Next on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Cassie: Go... If you want to go. I mean, I can't stop you.",
        "Edmund: Csie, i'm not doing this to hurt you.",
