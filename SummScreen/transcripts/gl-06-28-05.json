        "Reva: Jonathan, it's me. Look, I know I'm \r\nprobably the last person you want to talk to right now, but I... there's \r\nsomething I have to tell you. So call me, please. Olivia, its Reva. When you get \r\nthis message, could you call me back, please? I found out that your sister's \r\nhusband is very much alive. And I can't find Jonathan to warn him about his \r\nfather. And we both know what he's capable of. I think we have to find him, \r\nbefore he finds us. ",
        "",
        "Jonathan: I guess we both lost something, \r\nhuh? You lost your baby. I lost my mother. I'm not saying that those two things \r\nare equal. It's just... a loss. What? ",
        "Dinah: You never told me what happened.\r\n",
        "Jonathan: It doesn't matter. Mothers come and \r\ngo like the tide. ",
        "Dinah: Oh, come on. You don't mean that. I \r\nspent most of my life dreaming what it would be like to have a mother. \n",
        "Jonathan: Cue the violins. ",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs ) Stop. It was pretty great. \r\nPretty great to finally find her and have her. The connection was pretty \r\namazing, you know. I mean even though we weren't getting along, my mother loves \r\nme very much. I think she would do anything to protect me. ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, well, I'm me and you're \r\nbetter off not being an incubator. ",
        "Dinah: Don't talk about it that way. I loved \r\nthat baby. Maybe you like being alone, but I don\u2019t. ",
        "Jonathan: I know. But you would have been. \r\nThat baby belonged to Cassie and Edmund. ",
        "Dinah: Yeah, but there was a life growing \r\ninside of me, and it was my link to Edmund and all the plans I had, and that's \r\nwhy it was very hard to tell anyone that I lost it. ",
        "Jonathan: How long are you going to keep this \r\nup? ",
        "Dinah: I don't know. ( Laughs ) Maybe until \r\nI'm pregnant with Edmund\u2019s baby for real. ",
        "Jonathan: Well, I don't want a baby. I just \r\nwant some mindless sex. ( Both laugh ) ( Knock at the door ) ",
        "Cassie: Dinah? It's Cassie. Can we talk?\r\n",

        "Harley: Gus? Gus? Gus? Gus? Oh, my God. What \r\ndid you do? Mallet, what did you do? ",
        "Sebastian: Alan. Alan. Come with me. Alan.\r\n",
        "Mallet: Harley. Harley, forget about him. \r\nWe've got to get you out of here. Come on. ",
        "Harley: No. ",
        "Mallet: Got to get out of here. You've got \r\nto. Come on. ",

        "Mallet: Come on. Come on. ",
        "Harley: No. ",
        "Mallet: It's okay. It's going to be all \r\nright. Come on. They're going to find you. Come on. ",

        "Nate: Everything all right? ",
        "Reva: Nate... ",
        "Nate: Yes? ",
        "Reva: What happened before? ",
        "Nate: You love your husband and he is \r\neverything. And I get it. ",
        "Reva: Thank you. ",
        "Nate: That was quite a scene out here with \r\nyour son. Is that what the phone call was about? ",
        "Reva: I came back here to tell you that I'm \r\nquitting. ",
        "Nate: You don't have to do that. Look, angel, \r\nif I went too far... ",
        "Reva: No, it's not that. Well, actually it is \r\npart of that. I mean, if you play with fire, you're going to get burned. And I \r\nhave been spontaneously combusting several times a day as it is. ",
        "Nate: So you should stay away from anything \r\nflammable. ",
        "Reva: Something like that. What happened with \r\nJonathan was a cold slap in the face for me. And he desperately needs someone to \r\nlove him, someone to try to undo the damage that was done to him by that \r\nmiserable piece of garbage. ",
        "Nate: Garbage. ",
        "Reva: Yeah. I mean, what else do you call a \r\nman who willfully destroys a child that he was trusted to raise? ",
        "Nate: Hmm. I'll admit it's hard to find much \r\ngood in Jonathan, but you're his mother. ",
        "Reva: Well, you know, I was there for the \r\ncreation and absent for the duration. That's me. He'd actually get a laugh out \r\nof that. ",
        "Nate: I just think there comes a time when a \r\nyoung man has to take responsibility for his life. I mean, his old man's gone, \r\nright? ",
        "Reva: That's actually what the phone call \r\nwas. It appears that Jonathan\u2019s adoptive father is alive. And I could never \r\nforgive myself if I didn't make him face what he did to my kid. ( Crying )\r\n",
        "Nate: You need to quit this job to do that?\r\n",
        "Reva: I need to quit this job because I love \r\nmy husband, Nate. And I need to help my son, too. We need to find this man that \r\nnearly destroyed him. ",
        "Nate: Well, on that point, all I can say is \r\nlook no further. ",
        "",
        "Cassie: Dinah? Come on. Let me in. \n",
        "Dinah: Get out. Get your clothes. ",
        "Jonathan: No, I wouldn't miss this for the \r\nworld. ",
        "Cassie: I have a pass key, Dinah. I can just \r\nopen the door. ",
        "Dinah: Get away from the door. ",
        "Cassie: Dinah, is something wrong? \n",
        "Dinah: No. I'm not feeling well. I have \r\nmorning sickness. ",
        "Cassie: Still? ",
        "Dinah: You keep your mouth shut. You keep \r\nyour mouth shut about... ( Jonathan laughs ) don't laugh. You keep your mouth \r\nshut about this baby. ",
        "Dinah: You're going to get mindless sex, \r\nokay? All you can handle. ",
        "Jonathan: I can handle a lot. ",
        "Dinah: Just... do we have a deal? ",
        "Jonathan: Sounds like a fair trade. \n",
        "Dinah: Okay. ",
        "Jonathan: ( In southern accent ) But, Dinah, \r\nwhat ever will we do about the baby? ",
        "Dinah: Stop. Give me the baby. I've got to \r\nput it on. You've got to help me put it on. Come on. Hurry. Hurry. Thank you.\r\n",
        "Jonathan: You're welcome. ",
        "Cassie: All right, Dinah, I'm coming in.\r\n",
        "Dinah: Wait a minute. ",
        "Cassie: No. Coming in. What's going on?\r\n",
        "Dinah: Nothing. Nothing. I actually got \r\ndizzy. So I went to the bathroom and I got dizzy again and I went to the \r\nbathroom and I got dizzy again and I have to go to the bathroom a ",
        "Cassie: Well, are you okay? Do you want me to \r\ncall a doctor? ",
        "Dinah: Oh, yeah. No, no, no, no. I'm \r\nactually... I'm feeling good. I'm good. ",
        "Cassie: You just went to the bathroom three \r\ntimes. ",
        "Dinah: Except for that, I'm good. ",
        "Cassie: Was Edmund here? ",
        "Dinah: No. Why would Edmund be here? \n",
        "Cassie: Because you seem nervous and you seem \r\nscared. ",
        "Dinah: You make me nervous. That's why.\r\n",
        "Cassie: Since when do I make you nervous?\r\n",
        "Dinah: Since the pressure of carrying your \r\nbaby and the challenge, you know. I mean, my gosh. Would you just give me a \r\nbreak? ",
        "Cassie: Okay. You know, you could tell me if \r\nEdmund were here, right? I mean, did he threaten you? ",
        "Jonathan: Don't worry, Auntie Cassie. As long \r\nas I'm here, no one's going to lay a hand on my Dinah- mite. Ain't that right, \r\nSugar Plum? ",

        "Harley: ( Crying ) ",
        "Mallet: Harley. Shhh. Shhh. Harley. Come \r\nhere. Harley, Harley, I'm sorry. ",
        "Harley: What do you mean you're sorry? \n",

        "Alan: Now my son's shot. That\u2019s not supposed \r\nto happen. ",
        "Sebastian: Alan. Alan, listen to me. Do you \r\nwant to get caught? ",
        "Alan: Not another son. No. ",
        "Mallet: Now you can hit me all you want, but \r\nit's not going to change the fact. ",
        "Harley: You shot the man I love. ( Crying )\r\n",
        "Mallet: Listen to me. He had a gun! He was \r\nreaching for it. I didn't know what he was going to do. ",
        "Harley: You're a liar. I don't understand. \r\nWhat... what happened? What are you doing with that gun? ",
        "Mallet: Harley. Harley, listen to me. Harley, \r\nthink about your kids. There's still a chance that you could raise them, but we \r\nhave to run. ",
        "Harley: Let me go. ",

        "Cop: Don't move. ",

Okay, take it off the trigger. \r\nNow listen, pal, you're young. You don't want to mess this up, okay. This is \r\nwhat you're going to do; you're going to call for backup and then you're calling \r\nin a 10-38 for an ambulance. We've got a guy here that's been shot. He was \r\naiding and abetting a fugitive. ",
        "Cop: You took him out? ",
        "Mallet: Call for back-up. This place is about \r\nto be swimming in blue. If someone recognizes you... hey, Harley. ",

        "Alan: I will not! I want my son. Not you.\r\n",
        "Sebastian: Listen to me. Alan, Alan. I'm your \r\nonly salvation now, okay. So if you be quiet, we're going to get out of this. \r\nIt'll be fine. ",

        "Sebastian: Alan, death waits for everyone. \r\nShe'll have her day. ",
        "Nurse: What's the problem? ",
        "Sebastian: This is Alan Spaulding. He's a \r\nvery, very influential man. He needs treatment and he needs you to be discreet. \r\nMr. Spaulding is generous to those who take care of him-- very generous, if you \r\ncatch my drift. ",
        "Nurse: Do you know what's wrong with him?\r\n",
        "Sebastian: Nothing critical. He's just had a \r\nvery terrible shock. He's had some really bad news. The thing is, he has a heart \r\ncondition, okay? And I want to make sure he gets the best of care, starting with \r\nsomething to calm him down, calm his nerves. And a private room. ",
        "Nurse: We have a top cardiologist on call. \r\nI'll make sure he understands the situation. ",

        "Nate: As a friend. And my best mixologist. \r\nYou shouldn't have to find this guy by yourself. ",
        "Reva: I don't even know where to start \r\nlooking for him, and I have no idea how dangerous he is. ",
        "Nate: Exactly. You need assistance, someone \r\nto watch your back. Well, you've got me. ",
