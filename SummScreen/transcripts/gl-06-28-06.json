        "\"Finish Line\"",
        "Reva lurks about Springfield watching Josh and writing a note telling him she loves him and that she is having surgery in Minnesota. Billy takes her to the cancer center and she makes him leave her there. Later, Billy prays to G-d to bring Reva home. Reva meets a brusk woman named Tracey who has cancer, too. They bond and during the night, Tracey dies after her battle with cancer. Colin happens to be the attending physician for Reva. She gets him to help her with her 10 things she wants to do before she dies. One of them is to kiss David Cassidy, the singer. At a club, that plan fell through and Colin sings Karaoke to Cassidy's song, \"I Think I Love You\". Reva is elated. Colin helps Reva make a tearful goodbye video for her children and Josh. Then, he takes Reva to the car race track where she meets the racer, Travis Kvapil who lets her work with the pit crew. She dons a racing suit, takes the car around the track several times, speeds like a demon, and stops short of the checkered line. Colin applauds her, she lifts her visor and all you can see are her dark eyes, looking at the ..Finish Line."

        "Reva: Joshua. I wish I could say this was a love note. When's the last time either one of us wrote one of those? But I guess if we stretch the definition of love to fit what I'm saying, then maybe this is a love note. I see your face in my mind as I write this. Oh, what a face. I haven't seen you this energized by your work in such a long time. I'd hate to drag you down. I'm going to Minnesota for a while. There's a little surgery in my future. And if that doesn't work, they tell me there's an experimental treatment with a lot of promise. You're going to ask why I'm not telling you about this until now, and why I'm not letting you come and support me. You've spent all your adult life living with me, or looking for me, or waiting for me. It's just time I handled my life on my own. I'm not letting you go, Joshua, but I need to do this alone. I love you with all that I am. Reva.",
        "Billy: What's that?",
        "Reva: Just something for me.",
        "Billy: You ready?",
        "Reva: See you, Bud. Good-bye, Springfield.",
        "Billy: Looks like a snazzy hotel, doesn't it?",
        "Reva: Yeah, with crash carts in the hallways.",
        "Billy: No, no, you've got to think of that as room service.",
        "Reva: Have you seen the spa?",
        "Billy: (Laughs) Hey, shh, darling. It's not polite to stare, okay?",
        "Reva: I just... I don't... I don't feel like one of them.",
        "Billy: One of them?",
        "Reva: Yeah, one of them-- sick. You know, like one of them. (Sighs) That was a really bad thing to say, wasn't it?",
        "Billy: Oh, hey. You never were one to fit in. Come on. Oh, look, here's your room. Okay, so, I'll tell you what. We'll go inside and get you all settled, and then I'll go out and I'll get us some grilled cheese sandwiches and a couple of shakes.",
        "Reva: Grilled cheese?",
        "Billy: Yeah, grilled cheese. Minnesota, cheese. (Laughs)",
        "Reva: Billy, that's Wisconsin.",
        "Billy: Oh. (Laughs) Okay, well, what's Minnesota famous for?",
        "Reva: Miraculous cancer recoveries?",
        "Billy: Yes! Okay. All right, seriously. Now, I'm going to take you inside and make sure that you get all the things that you need, and then we'll go out and maybe we'll get you a little food. Then we'll go out and maybe see what's going on...",
        "Reva: No, no, no.",
        "Billy: No? No to what?",
        "Reva: No, no, no. You are going to go.",
        "Billy: Oh, I get it. You're going to take it from here. Hey, I had to sneak you out here. I'll be damned if I'm just going to leave you here.",
        "Reva: Well, then you be damned, and go.",
        "Billy: (Laughs) Want to hear something funny? I swore that I was not going to cry about this. Can you believe it-- I mean, a big, goofy guy like me?",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, you're a big, goofy guy with a big, goofy heart.",
        "Billy: Look, um... you know, when we were on the plane, and you went into the bathroom, I... the stewardess came by, and I said... well, she said, \"You want a drink?\" And I thought well, I'd like a bloody Mary, it'd be great. Then I immediately thought...",
        "Reva: Billy.",
        "Billy: I want you to let me be strong for you, Reva. Think about it. I could help. I know you're going to lick this thing, and I know you're going to come back and be that crazy ol' Reva who lives her crazy ol' life. But, you know, let me do things for you. Let me do something.",
        "Reva: No, Billy. You have a life, too. And a family-- our family. And you need to be back there. You need to be back there with them.",
        "Billy: Why?",
        "Reva: I need you to be my link.",
        "Billy: Okay, I'm just going to cut to the chase here. Is this just like Josh? You're not going to give in on this, are you?",
        "Reva: No. Unless you want to tangle with clinic security.",
        "Billy: Yeah, okay. You're going to get better. Get better.",
        "Reva: Okay.",
        "Tracy: I can't believe the lack of privacy in this place. Nice room. You must know somebody. Lucky you.",
        "Reva: Uh, no, actually, I'm... I'm just here for the procedures, just like everyone else.",
        "Tracy: Oh, save the \"We're all in the same boat\" routine for somebody who cares.",
        "Reva: Hey!",
        "Tracy: What, you got something to say?",
        "Reva: Yeah! Like, I have cancer, too, so I don't have to be nice to you.",
        "Tracy: Yeah, well, right back at you, rookie.",
        "Reva: I'm sorry I don't have your experience.",
        "Tracy: Well, obviously, because if you did, you'd know you're not fooling anybody with that horse hair on your head.",
        "Reva: Speak for yourself. The only thing you're missing is a patch on your eye and a parrot on your shoulder.",
        "Tracy: (Laughs)",
        "Reva: Sorry. (Laughs) I really am.",
        "Tracy: (Laughs) That was a good one!",
        "Reva: Sorry, that was awful. I'm Reva.",
        "Tracy: Tracy.",
        "Reva: I'm sorry, I really am.",
        "Tracy: (Laughs) Well, you know, I guess I deserved it.",
        "Reva: It's nice to meet you. No, no.",
        "Tracy: It's nice to meet you. (Laughs)",
        "Reva: I mean, you're just such a wonderful welcoming committee, what can I say?",
        "Tracy: I know. I'm a little cranky today. I had, you know, chemo earlier, and oh, God, I feel like pulling my stomach out and throwing it in the washing machine.",
        "Reva: I know.",
        "Tracy: I like you.",
        "Reva: Already? We've barely even started to insult each other.",
        "Tracy: Well, I've got to move fast. Time is no friend of mine.",
        "Reva: Yeah. So why don't you tell me how things work around here so I don't step on any more toes?",
        "Tracy: Oh, I can do that. This is trip numero quattro for me. I can't get enough of this place.",
        "Reva: How are the nurses?",
        "Tracy: Oh, Joe. The best. If you ever need a sponge bath, make sure to ask for one in the morning. He's on from 6:00 till 11:00",
        "Reva: Ohh. He's cute?",
        "Tracy: Oh! Muscles on top of muscles. And, you know, just a good, solid guy.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, I've had my fill of them.",
        "Tracy: Oh. Lucky lady.",
        "Reva: Well, there's only one that really counts, though.",
        "Tracy: So where is he now?",
        "Reva: You know, I don't exactly know what the protocol is, you know, the whole, uh... you show me yours and I'll show you mine.",
        "Tracy: What the hell are you talking about?",
        "Reva: The cancer thing, you know. I mean, I... I don't really want to get into it. I mean, we both know what we have, right?",
        "Tracy: Oh, yeah, we're sick. Enough said. I'm really sorry about that wig crack. (Laughs)",
        "Reva: No, hey, that's all right, because, you know... I guess I thought it was making me strong, and really it's more like ashamed or... I don't know, scared, hiding from the people who love me.",
        "Tracy: Well. Think of it this way. Nobody in this room loves you, so what difference does it make?",
        "Reva: You tell me. I don't see you walking around without a scarf on your head.",
        "Tracy: Oh. Yeah, see, the thing about me, though, is I don't have a problem taking it off. Kind of like looking in a mirror, isn't it?",
        "Reva: Kind of.",
        "Tracy: What about courage?",
        "Reva: Oh, no. No, no, no. Wait, just wait. You know, I need to hold on to... I mean, I need to look... (sighs) I don't know, maybe I'm fooling myself.",
        "Tracy: Like we've got time to waste fooling ourselves.",
        "Reva: Time. Maybe taking this wig off would free me.",
        "Tracy: Mm, you look terrible.",
        "Reva: I do not!",
        "Tracy: No, you don't.",
        "Reva: My mama used to say, \"There are all kinds of beautiful things in this world, Reva, even if they're ugly at first. All you have to do is open your eyes up wide and take a good look.\"",
        "Tracy: So what are they doing for you?",
        "Reva: Lymph node surgery. And if that doesn't go so well, then my doctor in Springfield said that they were going to try something called stem cell rescue?",
        "Tracy: Where they wipe out your whole immune system, right?",
        "Reva: Yeah, it sounds so pleasant.",
        "Tracy: Reva. I'm glad you're here.",
        "Reva: We're going to be okay.",
        "Tracy: Promise?",
        "Reva: I promise. You're going to be okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: I know a good person who needs your help, and she doesn't deserve what she's going through. I think you know it. I... I don't know why you're testing her this way, but you made your point. For this, please, bring her back to us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Beeping, grows louder) (voices in distance)",
        "Doctor: What happened?",
        "Nurse: I don't know, Doctor, but we're losing her.",
        "Doctor: I don't like her breathing.",
        "Nurse: She had an adverse reaction to the chemo.",
        "Doctor: I don't want to take the time to put a line in.",
        "Nurse: All right, well...",
        "Doctor: We've got to get her right in and move her.",
        "Nurse: The O.R.",
        "Doctor: They're ready?",
        "Nurse: Yes.",
        "Doctor: What room?",
        "Nurse: Five.",
        "Doctor: Okay, let's move it.",
        "Nurse: Let's get her out of here.",
        "Doctor: Ready? Let's go.",
        "Nurse: Go, go, go. God, it's strange life will change in a moment.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Excuse me. My suitemate, Tracy, she had some trouble last night, and they took her away. I just... can you tell me how she is?",
        "Nurse: I'm sorry, I just got on shift.",
        "Reva: Well, can you find out for me?",
        "Nurse: I'll ask.",
        "Reva: Thanks. Hang in, Tracy. It's so sad. For the first time in my life, I want to be somebody else. I don't want to be me right now.",
        "Josh: I'm afraid it doesn't work that way, darling. We don't get to choose when we go through times like this. You just have to hope that when your time comes, you'll have people around you that you can count on.",
        "Reva: Have I been stupid?",
        "Josh: I'm not sure I would go quite that far. (Laughs)",
        "Reva: I was only doing what I thought you would do, you know, self-sacrifice-- try to protect everyone, but not yourself.",
        "Josh: Who knows?",
        "Reva: You must have had moments when you thought about what your life would have been like without me in it, what it would have been like if you'd met some nice, well-behaved girl.",
        "Josh: Well, my life would have been simpler, that's for sure.",
        "Reva: (Laughs) Would it have been happier?",
        "Josh: What do you think?",
        "Reva: I think the real question is, do we love each other enough now to get through this?",
        "Josh: I'd say yes. But you haven't given me the chance to help.",
        "Reva: Great. I dominate everything. I close myself off and I never compromise. I tell you to take it or leave it, and then you take it until you finally wise up, and then you leave.",
        "Josh: I've never left you, Reva.",
        "Reva: Oh, yeah. And now, oh, by the way, I have cancer, you know, so drop everything, and gimme, gimme, gimme.",
        "Josh: Stop. That's not how it is. And this thing you're doing right now, this beating yourself up thing?",
        "Reva: It's selfish?",
        "Josh: Borderline, yes.",
        "Reva: I'm sorry.",
        "Josh: Don't be sorry. That's you.",
        "Reva: I know.",
        "Josh: And I love every bit of you as much as I ever have. You're going to make it.",
        "Reva: Thanks. Have you seen my list? (Knock at door) Finally, a doctor.",
        "Colin: Hello. How are you feeling today?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Hey, Josh.",
        "Josh: Yeah, hi, Billy.",
        "Billy: How are you doing?",
        "Josh: Great, fine. Thank you for asking. I'm kind of in an inspired frame of mind right now, so if you don't mind...",
        "Billy: Oh, I can see that. Yeah, what... oh, solar panels? And is this a heating duct?",
        "Josh: Yeah, running through every floor.",
        "Billy: You're going to recycle the...",
        "Josh: Everything. Recycling everything from heat and water to plastic and paper, even the heat generated by the blacktop of the parking lot.",
        "Billy: So you'll have a totally green building, huh?",
        "Josh: 100% green, yup. Self-sustaining, self- generating, self-contained.",
        "Billy: When's the last time you took a break?",
        "Josh: I don't need a break. I love what I'm doing.",
        "Billy: I'm just trying to look out for my best interests, that's all.",
        "Josh: So, Reva's plane. She get in okay?",
        "Billy: Yup.",
        "Josh: Good.",
        "Billy: She's going to call you when she gets a mind to, you know that.",
        "Josh: Uh-huh.",
        "Billy: Look, you know Reva, Josh.",
        "Josh: I'm not sure I do, Billy.",
        "Billy: You do, Josh. Trust me.",
        "Josh: Why should I trust you? You... you know what's going on with Reva; I don't. You know what Reva needs and wants; I don't. Congratulations. Good for you.",
        "Billy: You know, I'm not going to do this with you.",
        "Josh: Hey, listen, if you talk to her, give her a message for me. Tell her the project is coming along fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colin: Well, all done. You look good today. Everything should be a go with the surgery.",
        "Reva: And if it's not successful, then we move onto that other fun stuff, the experimental stuff?",
        "Colin: Let's take things one step at a time.",
        "Reva: Oh, right. No experimental stuff until after the third date. (Laughs)",
        "Colin: So what do you think of the facility here?",
        "Reva: Oh, I wanted to ask you. My suite mate, Tracy, she was having some trouble last night, and they wheeled her away. I thought maybe you might be able to find out how things are going with her.",
        "Colin: Tracy... Tracy Rollins?",
        "Reva: Yeah.",
        "Colin: Um, I'm sorry, Reva, I... I just... I overheard the doctors speaking in the lounge. She didn't make it.",
        "Reva: Oh. Wow, I mean, she just... she was so funny. I didn't realize that she was so sick.",
        "Colin: Well, from what I understand, she... she fought a good battle for a long time.",
        "Reva: Well. Now I know what I have to do.",
        "Colin: What?",
        "Reva: The list, my list. Ten things I want to do before I die. I thought maybe we could knock off a few of these before my surgery. What do you think?",
        "Colin: Uh... okay.",
        "Reva: Okay? Good! Good. Then I'm going to do it. And you, Colin McCabe, are going to help me. And don't give me that \"You'll have plenty of time to do all this stuff, Reva.\"",
        "Colin: Well, I wasn't going to give you that.",
        "Reva: You weren't? Why not? Never mind, I know the answer: \"Because I'm a doctor, I'm in the medical profession. I'm not in the hope and fairy dust profession. I am sure that we will be able to heal you, but I'm not going to make any promises.\"",
        "Colin: (Clears throat) I'm, uh... I'm kind of a stiff, huh?",
        "Reva: You said it, not me. But you never lie to me, which is why I'm recruiting you.",
        "Colin: No, Reva, I'm not here because I care. I'm here because it's my job.",
        "Reva: Thanks a lot. Don't be in such a hurry to walk out of here. Stay a while. It could be fun!",
        "Colin: According to who?",
        "Reva: Just sit, would you? Just sit. Read.",
        "Colin: (Laughs) Oh, number one. Did you-- ever buy your mother a fur coat?",
        "Reva: Yes, but she thought it was too nice to wear, so it hung in her closet.",
        "Colin: Number two. Have you ever been to the French Riviera?",
        "Reva: Not that I know of.",
        "Colin: Number three. Kiss... (laughs) You wanted to kiss... (laughs)",
        "Reva: Well, hey, it used to be David Cassidy, but when I was about 25, I changed my mind, and I mean... I have all his CDs. He's cute!",
        "Colin: Well, if you say so... (laughs)",
        "Reva: This reminds me of who I am. Or who I was.",
        "Colin: Look, this is ridiculous, Reva. I mean, what does a 15-year-old think the highlights of her life should be, anyway?",
        "Reva: Innocence, Colin, innocence. You know? I've given birth. I've been near death. I've been called crazy and much worse.",
        "Colin: Well, one woman's innocence is another man's foolishness.",
        "Reva: Do I have to beg you to grant a dying woman her last request?",
        "Colin: Look, you're not dying. Let me... okay, let me see the list. This is the list? This... this is all you wanted to do with your life?",
        "Reva: You think we can knock off a few of these before my surgery?",
        "Colin: Okay, if I help you, you have to promise me that you'll tell me exactly how you're feeling. No lies, Reva. 100% honesty between us, okay?",
        "Reva: Deal.",
        "Colin: How are you feeling?",
        "Reva: Like I don't want to be Tracy, not for a long time. Like I don't want to have any regrets.",
        "Colin: Okay, I know I'm going to regret doing this, but maybe we can knock off a few. A few, Reva, a few.",
        "Reva: (Squeals) Thank you! Thank you.",
        "Colin: Here, I, you know, I... (laughs) I have to tell you something. This is just too... you're going to think that this is fate or something. I say it's just an odd coincidence.",
        "Reva: What? What?",
        "Colin: Brace yourself, okay? Number three there? I... your guy, I saw in the paper, he... he's playing at a club down the street.",
        "Reva: No way.",
        "Colin: Would I make that up?",
        "Reva: No. You wouldn't. Oh, I can't believe it. I feel like I'm blushing! Oh, thank you! This is going to be great. Come on, come on. Right this way. Come on, come on.",
        "Colin: I need to have my head examined.",
        "Reva: I wonder if he'll do anything from his new CD. You know, I bought it right before we left Springfield, and I brought it with me. Maybe he'll autograph it for me.",
        "Colin: Reva, this is ridiculous. We're going to embarrass ourselves.",
        "Reva: You know what? Sometimes, in order for a plan to work, you have to shut up about it and let it flow. You're getting ready to talk yourself right out of helping me.",
        "Colin: Is that such a bad thing?",
        "Reva: Maybe not for you, but it is for me.",
        "Colin: Reva, why...",
        "Reva: Please, all you have to do is find the man and bring him over to me during one of his breaks.",
        "Colin: Me? Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh.",
        "Reva: Hey, I'd do it myself... but I'm actually feeling a little shy. I am! It happens sometimes, that's why I need your help. Now, do whatever it takes. You know, bribe him, put him in a headlock. Just get me my man.",
        "Colin: Look, he'll either come over here of his free will or he won't. My guess is, he won't.",
        "Reva: Why?",
        "Colin: Because this has the distinct smell of something that Lucy and Ethel would cook up, and their plans always failed.",
        "Reva: Well, I have complete faith in you. Hey, you talked me into chemo. The last thing you could do is just get some guy to come over here for a little meet and greet with a longtime fan. I want that kiss. And if you make this work, there just might be a kiss in it for you, too. Now go on. Go. Go find the guy. Find his people. Just don't tell him I'm sick.",
        "Colin: (Sighs) Can I tell him you're crazy?",
        "Reva: Yeah, that works for me. I can't believe he'd just cancel out like that at the last minute.",
        "Colin: The bartender said he was sick.",
        "Reva: I'm sure you're thrilled that you don't have to embarrass yourself.",
        "Colin: Well, everyone here thinks I'm a stalker.",
        "Reva: All I wanted to do was kiss him. That's it. You know what? David Cassidy goes back on my list! I just wanted to kiss the man. You know what's strange is that you can get so excited about meeting a famous person. It was nice, though. Kind of made me forget about everything for a minute. Felt like a kid again. And it was fun. I mean, it's not wrong to have fun, is it? It's good for me, right, Colin? Colin?",
        "Colin: (Singing) I'm sleeping and right in the middle of a good dream I wake up once I wake up from something that keeps knocking in my brain before I go insane I hold a pillow to my head and spring up in my bed screaming out the words I said, \"I think I love you\" come on, you know it!",
        "Reva (Singing): I think I love you!",
        "Colin (Singing): This morning I woke up with this feeling I didn't know how to deal with and so I just decided to myself I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it and didn't I go and shout it when you walked into this room \"I think I love you!\" I think I love you, DJ, I think I love you! So what am I afraid of? I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for I think I love you though it worries me to say that I've never felt this way. Oh, I think... oh, there's a key change. Now we're going to play out. Now they're just going to play. I need another cocktail.",
        "Reva: (Laughs) Give him another beer! Here.",
        "Colin: My beer. Okay, okay. Wait, here it comes. (Applause)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colin: No, no, no, Reva! That's it, that's enough. I'm not doing... no, no.",
        "Reva: Oh, come on, please, please! We're just getting started.",
        "Colin: I was up all last night waiting for the talent police to crash down the door and arrest me for being a bad... a bad singer.",
        "Reva: (Laughs) Oh, come on. Really? You were... okay, never mind. Now, on to the next project.",
        "Colin: No, how about this? You're cured. I didn't want to say anything until I was sure, but you're cured.",
        "Reva: No.",
        "Colin: It's all gone. You can go home now.",
        "Reva: Let me tell you something. This next project I think you're going to be okay with. I do, because it's just... it's something that I need to... it's just something I need to take care of. Oh, Dylan. Sweetie, you were my first born, and there's something... so special about that. Marah and Shayne, I think you know how I feel about you. I am so incredibly proud of both of you. Not that I can take any credit for it, of course, because your daddy did all the work. You're very lucky to have such an amazing father. And Jonathan. (Tsks) (laughs) We've had... such a wild ride, haven't we? You've taught me more about forgiveness than I could ever hope to learn. So take a lesson from who you are, son, because now with your own baby coming, I may not be around here to help you, you know. You know what the right thing is to do. You do. You know that, son. And then you, my sweet man. Joshua. You are the love of my life. These last few months have shown me that we're not human beings in search of a spiritual experience. We are spiritual beings in search of a human one. And we have walked hand in hand in that journey. And I've been so blessed to have you as my partner. To say I love you just doesn't cut it, because you are a part of me, just like I hope I can always be a part of you, always. That's it. Bye, everyone. (Crying) Okay, Colin, turn it off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: It's very scary. My voice is echoing, too. (Gasps)",
        "Colin: Okay.",
        "Reva: Oh, my God!",
        "Colin: (Laughs)",
        "Reva: Oh, this is exactly like I remember tracks being. I mean, the sights, the sounds, the smells. My pop used to take my sister and brother, Roxie and Rusty, to the track all the time, and I so loved it. I can't believe I'm here.",
        "Colin: Well, let's go.",
        "Reva: Whoo!",
        "Travis: Isn't she a beauty?",
        "Reva: You're Travis Kvapil!",
        "Travis: That's me.",
        "Reva: I'm Reva Shayne Lewis.",
        "Travis: Nice to meet you.",
        "Reva: Oh, it's so nice to meet you! This is my friend, Colin McCabe.",
        "Travis: Hi, Colin.",
        "Colin: Nice to meet you.",
        "Reva: Oh, it is an amazing car.",
        "Travis: What do you say? You want to take it for a spin?",
        "Reva: I'll see you at the finish line!",
        "Colin: Go get 'em.",
        "Reva: Thank you. Oh, wow.",
        "Colin: Go get ready. Go, go, go.",
        "Reva: Ooh! This is going to be such a rush.",
        "Colin: Reva, are you sure?",
        "Reva: Yes, let's do it.",
        "Colin: We? No, no, no. Not me. No.",
        "Reva: What are you talking about? We're doing this together.",
        "Colin: I'll be right here, rooting you on.",
        "Reva: You know what, that's your problem. You're a watcher, and I'm a doer. Well, I'm going to do it, because this car has my name written all over it!",
        "Travis: Sounds like you're ready.",
        "Colin: She was born ready.",
        "Reva: You bet. Thank you.",
        "Travis: Just need to show you a few things before we get you behind the wheel. Some girls go to church on Sunday Live life by a golden rule You got girls gonna graduate one day Summa cum laude from party school Some they walk the straight and narrow Some girls they just don't care Good girls go to heaven bad girls go everywhere Some girls are into heavy metal Dance with the devil everywhere they go Others up and cut a rug to the fiddle Dance to the rhythm of a cotton-eyed Joe Some they walk the straight and narrow Some girls they just don't care Good girls go to heaven bad girls go everywhere Miss hi-falutin' wants to sip fine champagne Prim and proper dripping in diamond rings Little sister wears high heels and blue jeans A long-legged dream and certified wild thing Some they walk the straight and narrow Some girls they just don't care Good girls go to heaven bad girls go everywhere.",
