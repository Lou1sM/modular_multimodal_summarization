        "Olivia: Listen, you pencil pushing weasel, you reactivate this card or I will hunt you down and force it down your skinny little gullet.",
        "Phillip: I hope I'm not interrupting.",
        "Olivia: No, actually, I was going to come looking for you.",
        "Phillip: Beth's reading Emma \"good night moon.\" I could swear she understands every word. The look on her face is just indescribable.",
        "Olivia: You're at a loss for words. That's kind of funny, because a few come to mind, like sick, twisted, despicable, heartless. Stop me when something rings a bell.",
        "Phillip: Something troubling you?",
        "Olivia: Canceled, canceled, canceled. All of them, by you. And don't try and deny it.",
        "Phillip: Have you've tried accessing your Spaulding account? I had that frozen, too. Just a little gift from me to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Then stay with me. Stay with me tonight in my bed. Our bed. I want to fall asleep in your arms and I want to wake up in the morning the same way.",
        "Edmund: Cassie...",
        "Cassie: Oh, Edmund. Come on, we've been doing this dance too long. You have to be honest with yourself. You came here to help me unpack. You helped Tammy earlier. You're here right now, because you want to be. There's a pull between us that you can't deny. You have to stop fighting it. Remember how good we are together. Please.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, Cassie, I remember that every minute of everyday . I couldn't forget it if I tried.",
        "Cassie: Then stay with me.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, you're right about why I came here. I can't seem to stay away, and that has to stop tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tony: So we're clean now. All right, we're strictly business types from mainstream all the way. You got it? Huh? All right, now you get in your car, you follow me down to the club because we need to discuss the union contract with Bill Lewis, his new development, all right.",
        "Bill: Hey, Tony.",
        "Tony: Hey.",
        "Bill: Since it involves me, why don't I follow you out there?",
        "Tony: Yeah, yeah, sure if you want. I mean, I thought you had someplace to be.",
        "Bill: No, no, no. That way we could talk about our remodeling ideas. All right, partner?",
        "Tony: All right. Sounds good to me.",
        "Bill: All right, come on. Let's go.",
        "Tony: Okay, let's go.",
        "Billy: Partner?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Danny? Do we have a child?",
        "Danny: Michelle...",
        "Michelle: Because if we do I can't imagine why you wouldn't tell me something like that. A teddy bear? I mean, really what else could that mean? What else could it possible mean? Unless...",
        "Danny: I just...",
        "Michelle: Okay, no, no. I get it, I get it. I get it. I collect these, right?",
        "Danny: Collect?",
        "Michelle: Yeah, the teddy bears. Teddy bears. That's... that's... that would be Michelle's taste. Or I mean my taste. Sorry. I'm sorry I freaked out on you.",
        "Danny: No, it's okay. It's all right. Everything is so confusing right now.",
        "Michelle: It is. It's confusing. It really is. And it's exhausting.",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Michelle: Can I take a rain check on the wine? I really just want to go to bed right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: You cut off my cash flow, access to credit.",
        "Phillip: I tried to cancel your passport, but actually takes a bit of doing. I'm working on it though.",
        "Olivia: My passport?",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm. Can't have you flying off to god knows where in the middle of the night with my daughter, can I?",
        "Olivia: Gee, why would I want to?",
        "Phillip: You see, Olivia, we're a family. And when we travel, we should travel together. Especially when we're spending my money.",
        "Olivia: You know what, Phillip? I don't need to spend your money. I have my own money.",
        "Phillip: Oh, then by all means please use it. Right. But see, that's marriage. It's just one big compromise, isn't it?",
        "Olivia: That's what you're all about compromise.",
        "Phillip: Olivia, if you weren't ready for a little give and take, you shouldn't have roped me into marrying you.",
        "Olivia: I didn't rope you in.",
        "Phillip: Or broken half a dozen laws when you bought and sold my my stock without my consent.",
        "Olivia: I transferred all those shares back to you.",
        "Phillip: Yes, after I made you.",
        "Olivia: And after I made you a nice chunk of change. You should be thanking me.",
        "Phillip: I'm keeping you out of jail. Isn't that thanks enough? While we're on the subject of reparations, you need to clear your schedule tomorrow. Something's come up.",
        "Olivia: Do tell.",
        "Phillip: I've called a special meeting of the Spaulding board just for you. You're going to greet the board, say a few heartfelt words complimenting them on their hard work, and then promptly resign. Here's your script.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Is this our bedroom?",
        "Danny: Mm-hmm.",
        "Michelle: And did I decorate this, too?",
        "Danny: Yes. Michelle, everything you see you decorated.",
        "Michelle: Wow. Physician assistant by day and interior decorator/wife by night. Talk about a superwoman.",
        "Danny: And you run a hotline in the crises center for troubled teens.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, and was that before or after ended world hunger and cured the common cold?",
        "Danny: Oh, it was during.",
        "Michelle: Yeah. So this is where I slept?",
        "Danny: Mm-hmm.",
        "Michelle: Hmm.",
        "Danny: That's your side of the bed.",
        "Michelle: Yeah?",
        "Danny: Yeah, you went to it first right away. Maybe that means you remember something.",
        "Michelle: Are my clothes in there? Yeah?",
        "Danny: Go see.",
        "Michelle: Oh.",
        "Danny: Yeah, the entire closet is yours. Mine is... my much smaller closet is in the other room.",
        "Michelle: Look at all these clothes. All right, let's see. What do we got? Oh, I like this. I like this. Cute print. Yeah?",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Michelle: Love the ruffle.",
        "Danny: Mm-hmm.",
        "Michelle: It's cute. It's cute. I think, you know, I have good taste here, right? Okay, but what's with all the suits? What did I wear suits to work or something?",
        "Danny: Sometimes. Mostly for important meeting, fundraisers. For the crisis center. And during the election you looked the part.",
        "Michelle: The part? What's the part?",
        "Danny: Mm-hmm. First lady. Yep, I ran for mayor of Springfield during the last election.",
        "Michelle: Are you serious? I figure you lost, because I haven't heard anyone calling Mr. Mayor or anything.",
        "Danny: Yeah, I lost.",
        "Michelle: Oh, look it here. Pink pants suit. Cute.",
        "Danny: Actually you wore that election night.",
        "Michelle: You remember what I wore?",
        "Danny: Yeah. Well, don't get too excited. I only remember because you had a little problem with the, you know, the zipper. It's a long story.",
        "Michelle: Oh, like this.",
        "Danny: Long story. You looked great in it.",
        "Michelle: I like this. This is pretty.",
        "Danny: Oh, yeah, yeah. That's one of your favorite dresses.",
        "Michelle: Really?",
        "Danny: Mm-hmm.",
        "Michelle: I wonder... you know...",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Michelle: I'm going to put it on. You know, you'll never know. Maybe it'll trigger something right? Let's try it out.",
        "Danny: Absolutely. Go for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Edmund, I know I hurt you, and I know you counted on me to trust you.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, maybe I counted on you too much. Even if we get past this, what happens the next time I do something to make you suspicious of me? Because there's going to be a next time, because this is more than a misunderstanding, Cassie. It's something that's going to crop up over and over and over again.",
        "Cassie: Then we deal with it, Edmund, we deal with it!",
        "Edmund: Yes, we deal with it by hurting each other and that's something I won't... I can't do that.",
        "Tammy: I'm back, and I bought a helper. Should we leave?",
        "Cassie: Actually...",
        "Edmund: No, no, no, Tammy. Of course not. I was just talking with your mother. Hello, Remy.",
        "Remy: Hey, Mr. Winslow.",
        "Tammy: Remy, saw me lugging my stuff out of the beacon and took pity on me, said he would help out.",
        "Cassie: Well, that was very nice of you. Thank you.",
        "Remy: Oh, not a problem.",
        "Tammy: Why don't we turn back around and get another load?",
        "Edmund: No, no. Tammy, you don't have to leave on my account. I'm about to head off soon anyway.",
        "Tammy: That's what you said two hours ago. Just FYI, I won't be staying here tonight. I'm going to stay at the beacon, so I can pack up the rest of my stuff.",
        "Remy: Excuse us. Thank you.",
        "Cassie: Just go if you want to go. I mean, I can't stop you.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I'm not doing this to hurt you.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I know. Self preservation.",
        "Edmund: What?",
        "Cassie: This is to keep yourself from getting hurt, Edmund. You're the one who has a problem with trust, not me. And I get that. I do. I just think it's about time you grow up.",
        "Cassie: I doubted you, Edmund, and I am truly, truly sorry. Now I've said it I don't know how many times, I don't know how many ways.",
        "Edmund: And now you think I should grow up?",
        "Cassie: Grow up. Move on. Except the fact that we're never going to be perfect.",
        "Edmund: I never expected us to be perfect.",
        "Cassie: But in a way you did. You needed this relationship to make up for everything that came before it. That's a lot to live up to, don't you think?",
        "Edmund: Yes, it is.",
        "Cassie: I'm going to hurt you, Edmund, and you're going to hurt me.",
        "Edmund: And you're all right with that? You're obviously all right with that.",
        "Cassie: No, I hate it. Everybody does. Okay. But you know what? You put yourself out there.",
        "Edmund: I did that.",
        "Cassie: Then you suck it up and you do it again. Because it's worth it. It's worth it to trust, Edmund. It's worth it to believe. It's worth to have your heart scrunched up ten different ways like a pretzel if it means you have what we have. (Sobbing) I know its scary terrifying, but you take that leap of faith because the alternative is to not trust at all, and to not love. That's unthinkable.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Remy: All right, one more load should do it. Tam?",
        "Tammy: I think my mom and Edmund are going to break up for good tonight, and there's nothing that I could do about it.",
        "Remy: Well, what went wrong? Those two have always looked totally in love to me. Now suddenly...",
        "Tammy: All I know is that mom said or did something that really hurt Edmund, and he just can't seem to get past it. And she says she's not going to give up on him, but you know, you try and try, and if the other person doesn't let you in...",
        "Remy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Tammy: After awhile it's like bashing your head against a wall, and you just hurt so much that you give up.",
        "Remy: Ah-huh. Are we talking about your mom now or someone else?",
        "Tammy: She and Edmund had something really great.",
        "Remy: Past tense?",
        "Tammy: I'm just afraid that if Edmund leaves here tonight, he may never come back.",
        "Remy: Okay.",
        "Tammy: So I guess the first thing to do would be to come up with some sort of way to make sure that he stays here.",
        "Remy: Yeah.",
        "Tammy: Remy, you're a genius.",
        "Remy: I know this.",
        "Tammy: Come on, we've got to work fast.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: You want me to...",
        "Phillip: Resign.",
        "Olivia: Mm-hmm.",
        "Phillip: You no longer have a place at Spaulding.",
        "Olivia: You expect me to read this?",
        "Phillip: Every word.",
        "Olivia: This garbage you wrote makes it sound like I did nothing for the company during my tenure. Like I was just keeping your seat worm.",
        "Phillip: Well, as I recall that's exactly what you said. You didn't mean that?",
        "Olivia: I'll use my own words.",
        "Phillip: No. You'll use those words. Or I'll pick up the phone, and I'll call district attorney O'Neill. I worked very hard on that speech. I expect to see it on a corporate record.",
        "Olivia: Well, then read it yourself. Tell the board I came down with a bad case of bite me.",
        "Phillip: No. You'll do it yourself in person. You will read it with conviction and feeling. Oh, and, you know what? It wouldn't hurt if you looked up and made a little eye contact.",
        "Olivia: Why are you doing this?",
        "Phillip: Because the board needs to know that there's been a smooth transition of power, and that everyone is okay with it. Everyone.",
        "Olivia: Well, what if I'm not convincing?",
        "Phillip: Oh, I have great faith in your ability to lie. Read it over a few times so that you're familiar with it. I really want it to sound like it's coming from you.",
        "Olivia: Phillip, just curious. Will you ever get your fill of humiliating me?",
        "Phillip: I'll let you know.",
        "Olivia: Hi, it's Olivia Spaulding. I need you to do something for me, now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: So, Tony, I really like what you're doing here.",
        "Tony: Thanks, man. Yeah, the architect had a pretty good design.",
        "Bill: I mean not just the design. I mean, you know, striking out on your own. You know, you work with someone else you've got to work within their limits. But when you work for yourself, the sky's the limit. If you fail, hey, least it's not for lack of trying, right?",
        "Tony: You've got full reign over there at lewis, right?",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, so I was told.",
        "Tony: Sounds like a \"but\" in there somewhere.",
        "Bill: I ran into my dad the other day at the beacon.",
        "Tony: Yeah.",
        "Bill: He's concerned about because he saw me upset about Eden once or twice. I get the impression he wants me to take a little time off or something.",
        "Tony: Time off.... time off for what, bill? So you could be miserable and bored?",
        "Bill: Exactly.",
        "Tony: You know what I mean?",
        "Bill: Exactly. I guess it's my fault. Oh, I guess I just got to learn to hide the feelings a little bit better.",
        "Tony: Yeah, well, you know sometimes it's hard, but you've got to do it, right? Or people take advantage of you. Piece of advice: Never let them see you sweat; you always travel light.",
        "Bill: Dad, what are you doing here?",
        "Billy: Excuse me for barging in like this, Tony, we need to finish the conversation that we started the other day.",
        "Bill: No, we don't.",
        "Josh: Yes, we do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: I'm sorry. I know this has got to be really weird for you.",
        "Danny: Oh, hey, you, too. You want me to leave?",
        "Michelle: No, I'M.... I'm actually... I'm done. You can turn around.",
        "Danny: Okay. Yeah, I've always loved you in that. I mean, that on you. You know what I mean. Oh, do you want me... it's always...",
        "Michelle: Yeah, I do. Thanks.",
        "Danny: Every time it gets stuck in the same spot. How's that feel? The dress?",
        "Michelle: You want to know if it triggered something.",
        "Danny: Okay. Well, hey, it's okay. It's like you said, it was worth a try. Oh, man.",
        "Michelle: Danny?",
        "Danny: Hmm?",
        "Michelle: Was I good to you?",
        "Danny: No, you weren't good to me. You were great. The best.",
        "Michelle: But we had our ups and downs, right?",
        "Danny: Oh, you know, you know. Not because of us. There were some outside things that we couldn't control, but we were always great, solid. I'm sorry.",
        "Michelle: You were good to me, weren't you?",
        "Danny: I tried. I tried, but you've always deserved more.",
        "Michelle: Can you do that again?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Coming up on \"Guiding Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I just want everything to be okay. Playing by the rules just doesn't cut it these days.",
        "Cassie: I love you, but the ball is in your court. Just let me know what you decide.",

        "Danny: How do you feel?",
        "Michelle: Like I married a really good kisser.",
        "Danny: And?",
        "Michelle: It was nice. And I like this dress, and I like this room, and that's kind of it.",
        "Danny: (Making a crashing bomb sound) (laughs)",
        "Michelle: But there's always tomorrow, right?",
        "Danny: That's right. Oh, you're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. Tomorrow, and we don't have to rush ourselves. Just take time.",
        "Michelle: Right, and I think tomorrow... it's going to be a little better because we won't be by ourselves, because Tony will be here, and I think that's really going to help me a lot.",
        "Danny: Umm... yeah. Well, I'm glad that you and Tony have that, you know, that connection.",
        "Michelle: You're still okay with that, right?",
        "Danny: Uh-huh.",
        "Michelle: Him moving in?",
        "Danny: Yeah, sure. Michelle, if that'll help you feel more comfortable.",
        "Michelle: Well, you said that he used to live here, so I'm thinking, you know, maybe it could spark something.",
        "Danny: Uh-huh. Yeah. I know you're tired, so I'm just going to go downstairs and lock up. And what else do you need to know? There's a... you'll find your nightgowns in the dresser over there, and the bathroom is just through your closet. I'll be back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: So you brought reinforcements?",
        "Josh: No, Bill, come on now. We are not trying to gang up on you here.",
        "Bill: No, why would I think that, right?",
        "Josh: If you want to go to my house or your place, any place that makes you comfortable, we could do that.",
        "Bill: Well, I'm comfortable right here.",
        "Billy: But this is Tony's place of business, and we want to talk family business.",
        "Bill: Now, see we're discussing business right now, Tony and I, and you two are interrupting. So please say what you need to say here or it could wait. But since I'm sure I know what this is all about, let me save you the trouble. You're concerned about me. The whole grieving thing, I get that. I appreciate it, I really, really do. But like I said I'm discussing business, and I'm about to close a deal. A deal that I brokered with myself, which proves that I am at the top of my game. So your concern is unfounded. So please.",
        "Josh: Bill, this is not about closing one deal. It's about making hundreds of little decisions everyday.",
        "Bill: Well, I know. I've been doing it for months.",
        "Josh: Decisions that have to be made with a certain amount of level headedness, do you understand?",
        "Bill: Like I have. What's the problem?",
        "Josh: Normally, yes, but not now.",
        "Bill: So what are you saying then, uncle josh? Tel me one bad business decision that's I've made since Eden's left? Just give me one.",
        "Josh: There hasn't been one yet.",
        "Bill: Then what are you saying? Spell it out for me, because...",
        "Billy: Okay. Look, we want to support you, but we also want what's best for the company, and josh and I have made a decision.",
        "Josh: Billy and I are going to become involved in lewis construction, again, just to help you out a bit until you get past this hump.",
        "Bill: This is unbelievable. You're demoting me.",
        "Josh: No, we're supporting you.",

        "Man: Well, it's nice to finally meet you.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, look, I don't have a lot of time. Can you do what we discussed?",
        "Man: On such short notice? Might be a little iffy.",
        "Olivia: Would this make it less iffy?",
        "Man: Hmm, I thought your husband left you high and dry.",
        "Olivia: Can you do what I want or do I find somebody else?",
        "Man: No, no, I can do it.",

        "Tammy: Remy, please tell me we didn't just do a really sneaky thing?",
        "Remy: Oh, it's not like we slashed Edmund's tires. We just disconnected his battery cables. (Laughs)",
        "Tammy: Right, and if that means that he has to stay at the farm, I mean it brings him and mom back together. There's nothing wrong with that, right?",
        "Remy: Absolutely. See, Tammy, the way I see it sometimes people need a little push to do what they really want to do anyway. Like Joey with you.",
        "Tammy: What about Joey?",
        "Remy: You know what? He's still crazy about you, Tammy?",
        "Tammy: No.",
        "Remy: Yeah.",
        "Tammy: You really think so?",
        "Remy: Oh, when we're at one of those meetings at Spaulding's and Joey thinks no one is watching him, his eyes are glued to you.",
        "Tammy: Well, maybe. But if he won't admit it and Lizzie keeps putting the moves on him all the time.",
        "Remy: Like Joey's really going to fall for Lizzie's, \"I only want to be a friend\" act.",
        "Tammy: I'll bet you anything that she's going to try to convince him to go to the summer fling with her. Then, you know, people will think that they're a couple, and pretty soon they'll be a couple. Lizzie will make sure of that, trust me.",

        "Tammy: I don't see how I can prevent it.",
        "Remy: For starters, make sure you see the dude whenever you can. That way he can't forget how terrific you are. And making him jealous probably wouldn't hurt either.",
        "Tammy: You mean, date other guys?",
        "Remy: Let him think you are. Tell you what. If you and Joey haven't reconciled by time the dance comes around and you have no one else to go with, I'll take you.",
        "Tammy: Get out. Seriously?",
        "Remy: Yeah. Why not? We'll have fun and really rub it in Joey's face.",

        "Cassie: It makes sense period. But what? You won't try?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, it's not that easy.",
        "Cassie: No, I didn't say it was easy. If it was easy, Edmund, it wouldn't be real. But it is real, and you know it is. I love you, but the ball is in your court. Just let me know what you decide. I have a house to unpack.",

        "Billy: No, no, let... let me. You're rung out and you're strung out, and if you listen to yourself for five seconds, you'd know it. We're just going to give you some time to get your act together.",
        "Bill: What? Before what? I wreck the company? Is that what you're implying here?",

        "Bill: Well, thank you, Mr. Aa.",
        "Billy: Hey, come on, I saw your apartment.",
        "Bill: What are you talking about? I did a demolition before I'm renovating.",
        "Billy: You think you could hold your feelings in and then just let them out when nobody else is around?",

        "Bill: Yeah, exactly. Like you're one to talk.",

        "Josh: That was the other day. This is today.",
        "Bill: That's what you said. But now you are here questioning my judgment because that's what's going on here? You don't like some of the business decision I made.",

        "Bill: To demote me is why...",
        "Josh: Billy and I are going to step back into the company until it's time for us to back out again. Then we'll leave it to you.",

        "Bill: No, you trusted me...",
        "Billy: Don't do this.",
        "Bill: ...To make these decisions. You trusted me to run the company my way, and that's what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to run it my way. Now stop second guessing me. Either get rid of me or just let me be. Do my own thing.",
        "Billy: This is exactly why we doubt you. Bill, do you think you're being rational right now?",
        "Josh: We'll look for you tomorrow. In the meantime you think about this.",
