        "Alan: Well, how's my beautiful Elizabeth this morning?",
        "Lizzie: Ready to make her escape. The doctors say I am ready to roll.",
        "Alan: Really?",
        "Lizzie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Alan: How's your baby?",
        "Lizzie: She is right where she's supposed to be. You know what she told me last night?",
        "Alan: What did she tell you?",
        "Lizzie: She said to me, she said, \"Mommy, I know that Coop still loves me even though he's not technically the dad, exactly.\" That's why he came to the hospital last night, he just can't let go of the baby!",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, I think you should forget about Coop and think about yourself. Now, your family is all your baby is going to need.",
        "Lizzie: Well, maybe so, but I need Coop. I mean, if we get back together again, Jonathan... well, there'd be no way that he'll even...",
        "Alan: Jonathan is not going to be a problem.",
        "Lizzie: What if he tries to make a claim on this baby, Granddad?",
        "Alan: Sweetheart. He will never bother you again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Tammy? No, what...",
        "Tammy: You're not going to believe it. Jonathan is gone.",
        "Josh: Gone?",
        "Tammy: He packed up his things from Outskirts and left town. No note, no message... I need to talk to Aunt Reva. Where is she?",
        "Josh: Funny thing: She's gone, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Hey. McCabe.",
        "Colin: Hey. Lewis.",
        "Reva: You know, if there's a problem today, I mean, if things don't go well...",
        "Colin: Hey, my surgeries always go well. Besides, you were driving at 180 miles an hour yesterday. This is nothing.",
        "Reva: Says the man with the big knife and the woman lying under it.",
        "Colin: Scalpel.",
        "Reva: I'm serious. Really. Things happen, unexpected things. And if for any reason...",
        "Colin: Put her out.",
        "Reva: Hey, that's not fair.",
        "Colin: Good night, Reva.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Wow, I sure have missed a lot.",
        "Coop: Har... Harley? Wow, where'd you come from? I thought you weren't even supposed to be back until...",
        "Harley: Well, I came back a little earlier than I thought.",
        "Coop: Uh-huh.",
        "Harley: Coop and Ava, Ava and Coop.",
        "Coop: Uh-huh, well... things are, well, a bit different.",
        "Ava: Very perceptive on your part.",
        "Coop: They're a bit different. How are you? (Laughs)",
        "Harley: (Laughs) Don't be embarrassed.",
        "Buzz: Hey!",
        "Coop: Uh-oh.",
        "Buzz: Get over here, get over here.",
        "Harley: Hi, Daddy!",
        "Buzz: When did you get back?",
        "Harley: Uh, sorry. Yesterday.",
        "Buzz: Yesterday?",
        "Harley: Yes. I stayed at a bed and breakfast.",
        "Buzz: Where are the boys?",
        "Harley: Uh, the boys are still with Lucy. I came by myself. I wasn't sure how long I was staying, that really depends on Gus.",
        "Buzz: Have you seen him?",
        "Harley: I've seen him. He hasn't seen me. I'm trying to, you know, gauge if he's ready. Or if I'm ready.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: I will find you, I will find you. You think you can just disappear on me? I will track you down! I will track you down! Appear right now! Right now! Appear right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Holy Hannah.",
        "Harley: What? What, what?",
        "Buzz: This is worse than I thought it'd be. Look at this place!",
        "Harley: Oh, my gosh. This is great.",
        "Buzz: This is... this is great?",
        "Harley: This is great! For Gus? This is neat! For Gus, this is neat! Don't you get it? He's going to be okay. Look. He rinsed out all the Chinese take-out containers. I don't even do that. And he stacked all of his back issues of \"Dirt Bike Illustrated. \" And underwear. Look, underwear on the chair! But it's clean underwear.",
        "Buzz: Um, uh...",
        "Harley: That's Mona. Hi, Mona. Look, she's wearing his dress blues cap.",
        "Buzz: Oh, good, he wasn't lonely. Wait, what is... shouldn't this be buried?",
        "Harley: This was the toupee from the first perp that Gus ever collared. First scalp, get it?",
        "Buzz: (Laughs)",
        "Harley: But look, he had it dry cleaned.",
        "Buzz: Oh, boy. Love is blind.",
        "Harley: No, Daddy. My eyes are wide open. Can't you see? The cartons, the toupee, the underwear? It's a sign. It's all the sign that Gus is... is back! Well, okay, maybe not back. But he's trying. That's the important thing. He's trying. And I don't even see any ashtrays anywhere, do you?",
        "Buzz: No, I don't see any ashtrays. You know, maybe they're out on the balcony. Maybe he smokes outside, you know.",
        "Harley: What are you hiding?",
        "Buzz: Nothing, let's get out of here...",
        "Harley: No, we're not getting out of here. I want to see what's in there that you're hiding from me.",
        "Buzz: I'm sorry.",
        "Harley: It's full.",
        "Buzz: So?",
        "Harley: It's full. That's what Gus would do. He would keep this in plain sight where he can see it, so he can fight his drug habit. Looking this thing in the eye, saying, \"I'm stronger than you! I'm going to win this battle!\" And you know what? He is winning the battle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: I'll find you if it's the last thing I do.",
        "Frank: Hey, I found it! All the way up here.",
        "Gus: Are you kidding me? You found it? Where?",
        "Frank: Oh, it must have fallen out of the box and rolled under the house, so...",
        "Gus: I got to tell you something. I don't know whether I'm missing a chromosome or what, but I am, like, genetically incapable of putting this thing together. I just... I can't do it, all right?",
        "Frank: Oh, Gus, it's... it's not just you. I mean, it's me, too. Look, I remember a time when I was putting together a swing set for Marina. I was so frustrated, I was screaming and the neighbors called the cops, and...",
        "Gus: Frank, I think we should just read the instructions, that would be the way to go, okay? Because we haven't read them, and I think that it just might help.",
        "Frank: Okay, well, how's your Korean?",
        "Gus: See, I promised to put this bike together like three months ago for Jude. And I just... I want to keep my promise, so...",
        "Frank: Well, this isn't just about Jude, now, is it?",
        "Gus: I'd like to get my life back together, just... this is a start. This bicycle is a start.",
        "Frank: Well, I think a very good start for you is getting off those pills. I know it hasn't been easy for you, so good for you, man.",
        "Gus: Well, it's like they say, it's like riding a bike. I got to learn how to build it first, I guess. But if I can do this, man, getting my badge back is going to be a breeze, right? Chief? Right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: So, um... what exactly did you do to Jonathan, Granddad?",
        "Alan: What wouldn't I do to protect the people that I love? Ask yourself that, huh?",
        "Lizzie: There is nothing that you wouldn't do. Which is why I know that you are going to help me get Coop back for the baby's sake.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth...",
        "Lizzie: Look, I need him, Granddad. Come here. Ooh, my goodness, I love you so much! And I know that you're going to get me what I want. You always do. And I love you. Bye-bye.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth. No, Elizabeth!",
        "Nurse: One more signature, Mr. Spaulding.",
        "Alan: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ashlee: Oh, oh, my God, Lizzie. When I heard, I rushed right over.",
        "Lizzie: Rushed? Ashlee, I've been in the hospital for 24 hours.",
        "Ashlee: Well, okay, whatever. I just wanted to let you know how sorry I was that your wedding was, you know, totally botched. But I just thought it was interesting that, if you believe it, people are actually saying that Jonathan's your baby daddy.",
        "Lizzie: (Laughs) Um, he is.",
        "Ashlee: What? You and... and Jonathan were with the... and the...",
        "Lizzie: That's how babies are made, Ashlee.",
        "Ashlee: So that's why he was so interested. In the clinic... he knew the whole time!",
        "Lizzie: Okay, yeah, I just don't want him anywhere near my baby, okay?",
        "Ashlee: Oh, all right. Are you saying you don't want him?",
        "Lizzie: Of course I don't want him. And the way it's looking right now, it doesn't look like Tammy wants him too much either. So if you happen to still want him, go find him. Oh, my God. Okay, careful of the baby! Hi.",
        "Ashlee: Oh! Sorry. It's just... if you ever need anything, you know, I'm always there.",
        "Lizzie: I am good. All I need is Coop. And I have everything I need to get him back. Right here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Where did Aunt Reva go?",
        "Josh: Uh, I believe Minnesota was the first stop. Don't ask.",
        "Tammy: Maybe Jonathan's with her.",
        "Josh: No, I don't think he is. She went off someplace by herself. I... something to do with a story. We're talking about Jonathan, though, right? So, why did he leave?",
        "Tammy: I told him I needed some time to think.",
        "Josh: Okay, well, maybe he's off someplace doing some thinking on his own. A baby's a big responsibility. Excuse me. Thank you.",
        "Tammy: Lizzie thinks he can't handle the pressure.",
        "Josh: Well, he stepped up and told the truth about the child. That's a start.",
        "Tammy: Yeah. He said he did it for Aunt Reva, but he wouldn't tell me why. Did she talk to you about it?",
        "Josh: No, she didn't talk to me about it. You know what I think, though, Tammy? I don't think he did it for Reva. I think he did it, in the long run, because of you. Because he knew that he would have your love and your support.",
        "Tammy: So I gave him the courage to break my heart?",
        "Josh: (Laughs) Yeah, is your heart broken, really, darling? Because I don't think it is. I think you're upset and confused and maybe a little bit hurt because he was with somebody else. But I think there's also a part of you that's very proud of him right now.",
        "Tammy: At first I wanted that baby gone. But that changed at the hospital.",
        "Josh: The hospital?",
        "Tammy: Lizzie almost miscarried. When I got her to the ER they hooked her up to this fetal monitor and I heard the baby's heartbeat. Jonathan's baby's heartbeat, it was incredible.",
        "Josh: He's lucky to have you. I think he knows that. I'm sure he just... just wants some time alone, that's all.",
        "Tammy: Yeah. Aunt Reva will be back soon. Just like Jonathan. They would be crazy to stay away. Right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse: She's ready.",
        "Colin: All right, hang in there with me, Reva. All right, let's get going. Scalpel.",
        "Josh: Reva, what's wrong?",
        "Reva: There's something I should have told you, something you should know. But I need to know you'll forgive me in case I don't...",
        "Josh: In case you don't what? (Heart monitor beeping)",
        "Colin: Could you adjust the BP cuff, please?",
        "Nurse: How long are you staying?",
        "Colin: I'm not sure. Just at least until Mrs. Lewis recovers. She will recover.",
        "Reva: Before you get upset, you should know that the prognosis is good. I will recover.",
        "Josh: Recover from what, Reva? What the hell is going on?",
        "Reva: I found a lump in my breast.",
        "Josh: Oh, no.",
        "Reva: It was malignant. They did a lumpectomy and gave me chemo, but the cancer... the cancer was stronger.",
        "Josh: How long have you known?",
        "Reva: Since I got back from Paris.",
        "Josh: And you didn't tell me?",
        "Reva: I couldn't tell you. Believe me, I wanted to tell you, but you... you were so happy. You were so involved with the veterans' hospital, your dream. I couldn't take that away from you. You've been the rock for years. You've taken care of everyone in this family, and especially me. So I decided that I was going to beat this on my own and not interfere with H.B.'s project.",
        "Josh: You didn't tell me you have cancer because of the veterans' hospital? What if those last few months that we weren't together ended up being the last months that we have?",
        "Reva: That's... that's not going to happen, because Dr. McCabe, he gave me a clean bill of health. The cancer's gone. I'm free! We're free to live our lives together. Oh, Joshua, I was so scared. I was so scared that I was never going to be me again because I've been so tired and so weak, not at all the Reva that you fell in love with. But now she's back. We have all the time in the world now.",
        "Josh: No.",
        "Reva: What?",
        "Josh: I'm sorry, Reva. I'm sorry. Too little, too late. (Heart monitor beeps)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean when you say forget the names of the veterans? It's a fountain of remembrance! I don't care. Just cut from someplace else. Look, it's... listen to me, all right, this fountain was Reva's idea. She wanted to have the names of heroes right there in front of the hospital so the families could see them when they come in. You know what, I would like to talk to Reva about it, but she's not available right now. But even if she were, I know... okay, all right. Thank you. I appreciate that, Doug. Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Where's... is Lizzie okay?",
        "Alan: Yes, she's fine, Tammy. You just missed her.",
        "Tammy: So she was released?",
        "Alan: Yes, she was. I... I was a little hard on you the other day, but I want to thank you for being there for her. Especially given all the circumstances surrounding the situation.",
        "Tammy: I'm glad I was there. The baby didn't do anything wrong.",
        "Alan: No. And neither did Jonathan. I know you're very disappointed in him right now, but I've seen a lot of good men make the same mistake. Now, I would hate for you to walk away from someone who seems to love you so much.",
        "Tammy: Why? Why would you care?",
        "Alan: I don't want there to be a lot of drama or complications surrounding Elizabeth and her baby. And from what I've seen, Jonathan would give up everything for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Stop! Stop it!",
        "Coop: (Laughs) All right, all right, all right. Let me see. How about a nice weekend at the lake? How does that sound?",
        "Ava: Ooh, that sounds nice.",
        "Coop: That sounds nice?",
        "Ava: Yeah.",
        "Coop: That sounds nice? Let me guess, you don't think it's going to happen, do you?",
        "Ava: It's just that every time we try to get together something always gets in the way.",
        "Coop: Lizzie. Uh, what are you doing here?",
        "Lizzie: They released me. Hey, Ava?",
        "Ava: Hey. How's the baby?",
        "Lizzie: She's great. Your visit made all the difference. Right after you left, she just... Jenna just stabilized.",
        "Coop: Jen... you're still planning on calling her...",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. That's the only name she's known. Right, Jenna? She doesn't really answer me.",
        "Coop: So, are you having something to eat?",
        "Lizzie: Um, yeah, maybe. Look, I was thinking that you were Jenna's father for a couple of months before we found out that you weren't. And it is still your mother's name, so I thought, well, maybe you'd want to be the Godfather?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Only three dishes. Three! That's got to be some kind of record. Don't you think? I mean, he is back, Daddy! And he's better than ever. I'm telling you, I am calling Lucy and I'm telling her I'm coming to get the boys.",
        "Buzz: Slow down.",
        "Harley: Because I think I've wasted enough time as it is, don't you? He's back. Okay, maybe not completely, but he's trying, right?",
        "Buzz: I just don't want you to get your hopes up too high.",
        "Harley: Mm, I'm fine. I'm an ex-cop, I take stock in physical evidence. But you know what, you're right, it might be circumstantial. Yeah. I think it's time to go to the source.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: So what's the matter, Frank? You think just because I can't put a bicycle together I'd be no good in the field? I won't be any good when it comes to a drug bust or a high- speed chase or something?",
        "Frank: Look, you've got to take this off first here, okay? Now. What about Mallet?",
        "Gus: What about him? He's got his doubts, I guess.",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, I've got a few of my own.",
        "Gus: Frank, I know what I've got to do, okay? I'm going to just pace myself and I'm going to stick with the program and... I guess when it's time to get my badge back, it'll be time to get my badge back, just like it'll be time to get my family back. I'm all right with that. There. (Cell phone rings) It's Harley.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ricky Paul Golden and Beth Elhers, \"Inside The Light.\"",
        "Ricky: We should tell the story over. It's too long, I'm going to condense it. I'm going to make it really small. Okay? Shall I tell you the story, but really quick? Okay. Oh, exhausted myself. Here's a funny story. (Laughs) What's great about working on this show is I don't have to give Beth any cues, I don't have listen. We just talk over each other and it's... it's like we're really married!",
        "Beth: Thank you. See Gus and Harley, Wednesday, July 5, \"Inside The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Cell phone ringing)",
        "Frank: Well, answer it. I mean, she wouldn't have called if she didn't want to talk to you.",
        "Gus: Yeah. Hi.",
        "Harley: Hi. (Laughs) Ow.",
        "Rick: Not a good idea.",
        "Harley: Hey, could I have my phone back, please?",
        "Rick: No. No, no. In a minute. We need to talk, okay? I just saw Gus.",
        "Harley: What? What is it?",
        "Rick: I'm sorry, Harley, but he is completely out of control.",
        "Gus: She hung up.",
        "Frank: What? Well, what did she say, what happened?",
        "Gus: Uh, she said, \"Gus, hi,\" and then the phone went dead. Well, we have to finish this bike up. Let me get it rolling. When Jude comes home with his mother, I want it to be there for him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: You know, as a Godfather you don't have to babysit, you don't have change diapers, you don't even have to play a lot.",
        "Coop: Lizzie...",
        "Lizzie: Look, all you have to do is look out for Jenna's best interest. You were her father for a couple of months.",
        "Coop: Lizzie! Okay, I know what a Godfather is.",
        "Ava: I'm going to go inside and let you guys finish this conversation.",
        "Lizzie: Thank you, Ava. Look, I wouldn't even consider asking you. Look, I know all the lies that I told you, but Jonathan is long gone, and me and the baby are all alone.",
        "Coop: Yeah. Alone except for the fact that you have an entire Spaulding family, not to mention a house full of servants that are ready to wait on you hand and foot. All right, Lizzie, I'm sorry, but I'm out of this.",
        "Lizzie: I know you still care, because you came to the hospital.",
        "Coop: When I thought the baby was still mine and I was the father. All right, I was willing to give up everything for you. But I'm not the father, Lizzie. All right? I'm not the father, and I have other responsibilities now.",
        "Lizzie: I know that she loves you, okay? But she doesn't need you like we do. Can't you just...",
        "Coop: No, no, Lizzie. That's the thing, I can't. All right? I can't be a Godfather to your baby. In fact, I can't be anything. Are we clear?",
        "Lizzie: Everyone always tells me that they love me, and then they leave. And now you're doing the exact same thing to my daughter.",
        "Coop: Just, would you... go home. Okay? Go home and get some rest before you end up back in the hospital again.",
        "Lizzie: Maybe if her and I had never left the hospital then everyone would be happy.",
        "Coop: Don't talk that way. Lizzie, I'd never want anything to happen to you or your baby. I've already told you how I feel about you.",
        "Lizzie: You loved me.",
        "Coop: You need to let go of the past. It's over. Okay? Now, go home and get some rest. Promise me.",
        "Lizzie: I will.",
        "Coop: Good-bye, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Good-bye? I do not think so. Ashlee? Hey, it's me. Look, if you're my friend, you're going to do exactly what I say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: When are you coming back, Reva? (Heart monitor beeping) When are you coming back?",
        "Reva: We just got back together.",
        "Josh: Back together? Reva, come on. How have we been together? I mean, we've barely seen each other these last few months. Did... did you think I was just going to wait, Reva, wait for you to decide that you need me again?",
        "Reva: I do need you, I've always needed you.",
        "Josh: Really? Is that why we've gone our separate ways? But then again, now that I think about it, this is exactly how it's been through most of our lives, isn't it? You in one part of the world, me and the kids someplace entirely different. But it's different this time, Reva. I'm not just holding down the fort this time. I'm actually doing something. I'm trying to make a difference in the world, Reva. I'm creatively challenged in a way I never have been before. Because of the veterans' project, I see the world in an entirely different way. I see you in an entirely different way.",
        "Colin: Hold on, Reva. Just a little bit longer.",
        "Reva: Hold on! Just... you have to...",
        "Josh: What, Reva? Wait? Stop? Put my life on hold. Is that really what you expected me to do, Reva? Because I couldn't do that. That's not the way life works, and you damn well know it. Life has a way of moving forward. It moves on. Even without Reva Shayne in it.",
        "Reva: I never wanted to exclude you. I just didn't want to be a burden. I knew that it was a risk I had to take. I had to. For you.",
        "Josh: For me?",
        "Reva: I didn't want our lives together to be about my cancer. I didn't want to be your sick wife.",
        "Josh: I never asked for your protection, Reva. And by the way, a sick wife is a whole hell of a lot better than no wife at all. (Heart monitor beeping)",
        "Colin: All right, all affected nodes have been removed. You can bring her out.",
        "Reva: Bring me out. Wake me up. Because this isn't real, Joshua. I have cancer. I just told you, I have cancer, and what, you're moving on? You're walking away? You're telling me that it's over? Who are you?",
        "Josh: I'm Joshua Lewis. Your childhood sweetheart, the father of your children. Your husband.",
        "Reva: Yes.",
        "Josh: I've known you most of my life, Reva. But you've never really known me. If you really knew me, you would have told me. You would have let me help. If you really knew me, we wouldn't be having this conversation at all. Because you wouldn't have shut me out. You wouldn't have left me again.",
        "Reva: I didn't leave you! I didn't! I put you first. I put the kids first, I just didn't want you to... to worry about me every day and to spend your nights wondering whether I was going to wake up in the morning. I wanted to come back to you whole, full of energy. And it worked. I did! I kicked the cancer. And you kick-started that hospital. We should be overjoyed right now. And I promise you, the next time something goes wrong, I'll let you in on it. I will tell you.",
        "Josh: Reva. There won't be a next time.",
        "Reva: No, Joshua, don't say that. Please. Joshua? (Echoing) Joshua!",
        "Colin: Welcome back. I should say you did a good job, but, really, you should be saying that to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Remy: Winslow!",
        "Tammy: Oh, what happened?",
        "Remy: (Laughs) Nothing. I was here questioning a witness and I saw you up the hall.",
        "Tammy: Oh. Well, Jonathan's gone. He packed up and left.",
        "Remy: Sounds about right. I'm sorry. You know how I feel about the guy.",
        "Tammy: Yeah.",
        "Remy: But I have a really good sympathetic face. Want to see it?",
        "Tammy: (Laughs) Not bad.",
        "Remy: (Laughs) So, the Bauer barbecue is coming up. You want to go with me? Come on, it'll be good for us. So what do you say? (Cell phone rings)",
        "Tammy: It's a text message from Jonathan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ashlee: I got here as soon as I...",
        "Lizzie: Shhh. Just wait until he goes. Good, we're alone. Thank you for coming.",
        "Ashlee: Well, yeah, I'm just wondering, what are we doing on the roof?",
        "Lizzie: I just love the view. I mean, take a look. I thought that I would share it with you before I share it with Henry.",
        "Ashlee: Oh, this is a first.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, come on, I'm sorry for being such a freak before, okay? It's... I don't know, it was my hormones. I really do think of you as a friend. And friends help each other out, right?",
        "Ashlee: Right, yeah. How much will it cost me?",
        "Lizzie: All I want you to do is deliver a note. It's that simple.",
        "Ashlee: I was born at night, yes, but not last night.",
        "Lizzie: Look, I just want Coop to see all of this. It's kind of romantic. And if you deliver the note, he will come for sure.",
        "Ashlee: What do I get out of it?",
        "Lizzie: You still want Jonathan, don't you?",
        "Ashlee: Of course I do.",
        "Lizzie: Deliver the note and I'll get you what you want.",
        "Ashlee: You're on. Careful. It's a long way down.",
        "Lizzie: Tell me about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: I'm sorry. I really am. I know you were hoping that Gus was going to kick the habit, Harley. I was, too.",
        "Harley: And what makes you think he hasn't?",
        "Rick: Because I just saw him, Harley, and he was acting like a maniac. He was out of control, he was incoherent. He was a mess. And there's no way that I'm going to allow Jude to share a home with a man that's unstable, possibly even dangerous.",
        "Harley: (Laughs) Wait. Are you serious?",
        "Rick: Harley, I can't forget what I just saw, especially when it concerns our son. Now, you... if you were honest with yourself, if you weren't in love with this man, you wouldn't allow him anywhere near our children. You're enabling him, Harley. You've got to stop it. He's an addict. He's a junkie. He's hooked on something, I don't know what it is. Now you... believe me, I've been through this. I know what I'm talking about. I'm just telling you the way I see it. It's going to be a very long time before he's in any shape to be anywhere near you and the boys.",
        "Harley: I think I'll decide that.",
        "Rick: No, you're not. No, you're not. Because if you're even thinking about bringing him back, Harley, I will take you to court. And I'll do anything to keep him away from my son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colin: It went so well I should be charging you double.",
        "Reva: I don't trust that smile.",
        "Colin: (Laughs)",
        "Reva: You didn't do anything sneaky while I was under, did you?",
        "Colin: You're the worst patient I've ever had.",
        "Reva: You're the worst doctor. All I really want is to just wake... I need a phone. I need... I need to call Joshua.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Wanda, just tell the pilot to get the jet fired up. Just got to drop me off and then he can go. Okay, it's a one-way deal. And I need you to arrange a hotel for me, okay? A suite. Something big, something I can live in for a while. No, no. I'm going to stay for as long as the project takes, all right? I'm going to supervise from here on in onsite, in Oklahoma. What about Reva? Well, that's a hell of a good question.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Remy: Okay, so why aren't you reading Jonathan's message?",
        "Tammy: What if it says, \"Good-bye,\" and \"I'm gone for good?\"",
        "Remy: You want me to read it first?",
        "Tammy: No. It's okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: You would not take Jude away from me.",
        "Rick: Harley, I don't trust him and neither should you. And if I have to go to court to protect Jude, that's what I'm going to do.",
        "Harley: I know he's going to kick this. You want to take us to court? Rick, you go right ahead. Because we'll win.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Ava, you still haven't asked me what happened with Lizzie.",
        "Ava: I'm not sure I want to know.",
        "Coop: I told her that I couldn't be the Godfather of her baby. All right? So basically, I set her straight about a lot of things. Now, I know. I know that this is my fault, and I never should have gone over to the hospital.",
        "Ava: Well, you went there because you care about the baby and because you're a good friend. With Jonathan gone, probably for good...",
        "Ashlee: Jonathan's gone?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Now, don't worry, baby Jenna. Mommy wouldn't dream of hurting you. We just need to remind daddy Henry how much we mean to him.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Alan: All you have to do is sign on the dotted line and we will all have reason to smile.",
        "Cassie: You'd go to Oklahoma and leave Springfield?",
        "Josh: Yeah, why not?",
        "Reva: Hey, it's me. I need you.",
        "Ashlee: There's somebody out on the roof. It looks like they're planning to jump."
