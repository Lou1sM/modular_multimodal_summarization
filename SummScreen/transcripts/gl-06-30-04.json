        "\r\nDanny: Michelle? Hey, rise and shine sleepy head. It's late. I got your coffee-- \r\nbreakfast of champions. All right, now don't make me get the tickle bug. Here it \r\ncomes. Hey, Michelle? Michelle? ",

        "Cassie: Edmund? ",
        "\r\nEdmund: Well, hello. Mystery solved. I know why the car wouldn't start last \r\nnight: It was a loose battery cable. I fixed it and am ready to go. ",
        "Cassie: You're leaving? ",
        "Edmund: I have to, Cassie. I can't move in \r\nhere with you without getting the rest of my things. ",
        "",
        "Phillip: Show time. ",
        "Olivia: Yeah, no, I know. Just give me a \r\nminute, okay? ",
        "Phillip: Why? It's not like you have to \r\nprepare what you're going to say. I've already given you your speech. \r\n",
        "Phillip: You've had enough time. Let's go.\r\n",
        "Man: Ms. Spencer! ",
        "Olivia: It's about time. Where have you been?\r\n",
        "Man: These weren't easy to get, but I think \r\nthese are what you wanted. ",
        "\r\nOlivia: Yeah. You know, I was a little worried about my speech, but I think this \r\npresentation is going to be quite entertaining. ",

        "Mel: Chips. ",
        "Rick: Okay. ",
        "Mel: Dips, pretzels. ",
        "Rick: Got it. Pretzels. ",
        "Mel: Soda. ",
        "Rick: Drinks. ",
        "Mel: Napkins. ",
        "Reva: Whoa. Whoa, whoa. I thought you might \r\nneed some help with some food. ",
        "Rick: You mean... wait a minute, you're \r\nactually going to help out? It's not about eat and run this year? ",
        "Reva: Don't start with me, sweet one. \r\n",
        "Mel: (Laughs) ",
        "\r\nReva: No, I'm here to help. I figured with Ed not here and Michelle not quite \r\nherself right now, you might need an extra hand. ",
        "Mel: Well, you're early. You know, the \r\nbarbecue is tomorrow. ",
        "Reva: Well, I know that. There's all this \r\nfood here. There must be something I can do. ",
        "Rick: Go right ahead. ",
        "Reva: Veggies. ",
        "Mel: You know what? Macaroni salad. \r\n",
        "Reva: Is that for this? ",
        "Mel: Yes. ",
        "Reva: Okay. ",
        "Mel: That would be perfect. ",
        "Reva: Let's do that. ",
        "Mel: Thank you. ",
        "\r\nRick: So, Danny brought Michelle home from the hospital last night. I just don't \r\nthink she's going to show up until after the party starts, if at all. \r\n",
        "\r\nReva: Rick, I know exactly what she's going through. I mean, to have her life \r\ntotally erased like that. She's feeling lost and confused. She will for some \r\ntime. ",
        "Rick: Well, judging by the way Danny looked \r\nwhen he brought her home last night; she's not the only one. ",
        "",
        "Michelle: Hey. ",
        "Danny: What's going on? ",
        "Tony: Well, look who I found. ",
        "Michelle: Are you hungry? I went to Halber's \r\nBakery that\u2019s down the block. ",
        "Danny: When did you...? I mean, I didn't know \r\nyou... I went to the room and... ",
        "Michelle: I'm sorry. Was I supposed to check \r\nin with you? ",
        "Danny: (Sighs) no, no. Of course not. I \r\nmean... how did you know about the bakery? ",
        "Michelle: We passed it last night on the way \r\nhere. Check out Tony\u2019s hair. It's pretty cool, huh? ",
        "Tony: Yeah, thanks. ",
        "\r\nMichelle: All right, well, I'm going to go upstairs and change. Oh, how come \r\nthere's a bunch of rooms that are locked up there? ",
        "Danny: Michelle, it's a big house. I just \r\ndidn't want it to be too much for you all at once. ",
        "Michelle: I can handle a couple of extra \r\nrooms, Danny, unless you're hiding a bunch of skeletons in there. ",
        "Tony: Yeah. Boo. You had no idea she was \r\ngone, did you? ",
        "\r\nDanny: Hm? No. I spent the night in one of the guest rooms. I guess I didn't \r\nhear her when she got up this morning. ",
        "Tony: Maybe because she didn't, Danny. I \r\nthink she was out all night. ",
        "Michelle: Date book, huh? Hm. Let's see what \r\nI have been up to. Take \u201cR\u201d to the mall.\u00a0 Who's \u201cR\u201d? ",
        "",
        "Edmund: Mm. ",
        "Cassie: You don't have to take off so soon, \r\ndo you? ",
        "Edmund: I may never leave. God, I missed you.\r\n",
        "Cassie: Is that what changed your mind about \r\nus? ",
        "Edmund: Well, do you really want to know the \r\ntruth? ",
        "Cassie: I'm feeling brave. Sure, yeah. \r\n",
        "Edmund: I was afraid. ",
        "Cassie: I don't understand. What do you mean?\r\n",
        "\r\nEdmund: Do you remember when you drew your now-famous conclusion that I was part \r\nof\u00a0 Vinnie Salerno's drug ring? Well, at that moment, I said, \"that's that.\" I \r\nmean, how do you overcome a suspicion that runs that deep? I thought that's the \r\nend of the relationship. ",
        "Cassie: I thought so, too. ",
        "\r\nEdmund: But Cassie, when you realized you were wrong, you bounced back and you \r\ndid everything you possibly could to keep us together. ",
        "\r\nCassie: I'm sorry, I couldn't lose you over one stupid mistake. I mean, that \r\nwould be a mistake. Are you still hurt? I mean, because of what I did? \r\n",
        "Edmund: Yes, I am. I can't pretend that I'm \r\nnot. Cassie, you're teaching me that love and pain, they can coexist. \r\n",
        "Cassie: You sound surprised about that.\r\n",
        "\r\nEdmund: Well, I am. I am. I never thought that was possible. For me, in my past, \r\nif anyone ever hurt me, I'd hurt them back. And worse, I'd declare a war on \r\nthem. I'd annihilate anyone who... well, I guess we see how quickly that feeling \r\ncomes back. ",
        "",
        "\r\nTony: Obviously, Michelle is going to make her own choices, Danny. You know, \r\nshe's going to go places; she's going to talk to people. What if someone-- \r\nanybody-- asks her about Robbie? ",
        "Danny: Yeah, I know, Tony. I know. I'm going \r\nto tell her. ",
        "\r\nTony: You're going to tell her. Okay, when? You cannot shut her out from her \r\nfamily and her friends, Danny, like you did upstairs. ",
        "Danny: I am going to tell... I'm going to \r\ntell her before the barbecue. ",
        "Tony: Okay, good. ",
        "Danny: Okay? ",
        "\r\nTony: Good. Go upstairs, unlock the doors and make it feel comfortable for her \r\nbeing here, all right? This is home to her. ",
        "Danny: What about you? Do you feel like \r\ncoming home again? ",
        "Tony: What does that mean? ",
        "Danny: I need you to move back in here with \r\nus. ",
        "Tony: Danny, I can\u2019t. No. ",
        "Danny: Look, I know that you've tried to put \r\nsome distance between us. ",
        "Tony: I'm sorry. ",
        "Danny: It's temporary. It\u2019s for Michelle.\r\n",
        "Tony: It can't work. It can't work. It can\u2019t.\r\n",
        "Danny: Why not? ",
        "Tony: It won't work because with the life \r\nI've got going now, it's just not going to work, Danny. ",
        "\r\nDanny: I don't care, Tony. I don't care. You are the only thing that Michelle \r\nremembers. You are her... the only steady thing in her life. ",
        "\r\nTony: Listen to me. Listen to me, please. When she gets her memory back, it's \r\ngoing to be because of you, not me. What am I to Michelle, anyway? I'm nothing.\r\n",
        "Danny: Right now? You're it. ",
        "Tony: Don't do this to me, Danny. I can't do \r\nit. I'm sorry, I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t. ",
        "Danny: Tony, it's not what I want. It's what \r\nMichelle wants. ",
        "Tony: (Sighs) ",
        "\r\nMichelle: \"R.\" Took to the dentist. \"R.\" Pizza. R, R. Rick, my brother? I guess \r\nwe're pretty close. (Sighs) stop looking at me like that. You're not helping. \r\nAll right. All right, come on, really. How busy can one person be? I donated \r\nblood. Took course at cedars. \"Harley's angels,\" whatever that is. Another \r\nhot-line shift. \"Georges... Georges, 8:00 pm.\" Either that's a French restaurant \r\nor I'm stepping out on Danny. All right, come on. Get serious here. We've got a \r\nlot of clues in here. A fashion show and a 4-h club meeting all on the same day. \r\nWho are you? ",
        "",
        "Cassie: You're not the guy that causes pain \r\nanymore. ",
        "\r\nEdmund: Well, that's only because you showed me another way to live and only \r\nbecause you've loved me and I didn't want to hurt you back. I think, maybe, \r\nthat's also why I pulled away. ",
        "Cassie: That did hurt me. ",
        "\r\nEdmund: I know, I'm sorry. I think that's just all part of the love/pain thing. \r\nYour showing me how not to be afraid anymore and the world can be a very gray \r\nplace. I love you. ",

        "Tammy: So, is your car okay? ",
        "Edmund: Yes. It's funny you should mention \r\nthat because there was a loose battery cable. I fixed it, but it was... \r\n",

I mean, as drastic as \r\nit was, the electroconvulsive therapy, it might have cut his stay at Ravenswood \r\nby months, wouldn't you say? So, why not share the wealth?
