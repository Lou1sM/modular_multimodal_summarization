        "Coop: Excuse me, sir. You forgot your...\r\nhave a good day. All right, I never thought that guy was going to leave. How many\r\ncups of coffee did he have, anyway? ",
        "Lizzie: Six. And we really do need to start\r\ncutting our refills down to two. They're kind of cutting into our profit\r\nmargin. ",
        "Coop: Forget that. Come here for a second. I\r\nhate the fact that we have to wait until everyone else is gone before we can\r\neven wink at each other. ",
        "Lizzie: I understand that, but we're not\r\ngoing to have to hide much longer. We've just got to wait for my Granddad to\r\ncool down. ",
        "Coop: I'm not worried about Alan, okay? ",
        "Lizzie: Well, you should be. I mean, I love\r\nhim to death, but he's got this look lately that just really scares me. Listen,\r\nokay, we don't need to cross him right now. ",
        "Coop: Cross him? By doing what? This? ",
        "Lizzie: ( Laughs ) ",
        "Coop: Mm. ",
        "Ross: Hello. ",
        "Lizzie: Coop, go bus the tables. I swear you\r\nhave the attention span of a gnat. ",
        "Coop: Shouldn't you be at the mall right now\r\nbossing around some shoe salesperson? I swear, TGIF to her means \"Thank\r\nGod It Fits.\" ",
        "Lizzie: He is such a loser. ",
        "Ross: Well, obviously I can't keep up with\r\nanything because I thought for sure that you two were an item. ",
        "Lizzie: I don't think so. ",
        "Coop: No. No way. ",
        "Lizzie: There's no way I could date him. ",
        "",
        "Alexandra: Alan, where are you? Look, I know\r\nyou're upset with me, but please, please call me as soon as you can. I don't\r\nwant you to go off the deep end like Phillip did and do something we'll all be\r\nvery, very sorry for. I'm worried about you. ",
        "Alan: I shot my boy.\u00a0 I knew that he... ( Gunshots ) ",
        "Alexandra: Where was he? ( Gunshots )\u00a0 You killed your own son! ",
        "Alan: He laughed in my face.\u00a0 You figured it out, did you, Sebastian? ",
        "Sebastian: Phillip, you murdered your own\r\nson. ",
        "",
        "Gus: Hey. ",
        "Nurse: Hey. Come with me. I'll find you a\r\ndoctor. ",
        "Gus: No, no. The only doctor I need to see\r\nis the doctor that I got killed, Dr. Wallace, in that hit and run. I don't know\r\nif you remember, but my wife and I were the witnesses to that, and I was just\r\nwondering... ",
        "Nurse: If he left a message or anything else\r\npersonal behind? ",
        "Gus: Yeah. How did you know I was going to\r\nask that? ",
        "Nurse: His brother just asked, but there's\r\nnothing. ",
        "Gus: His brother? Is his brother still\r\naround? Well, it's true what they say. New York\u2019s got one of everything. You want to tell me what\r\nyou're doing here? ",
        "",
        "Mallet: You looking for this? That's what I\r\nlove about old Times Square hotels. They lock from the inside. ",
        "Harley: Mallet. ",
        "Mallet: Hmm? ",
        "Harley: Give me the key, okay? I have to go\r\nout and find Gus. He could be in trouble. ",
        "Mallet: We're sticking to the plan, Cooper. ",
        "Harley: But what if something went wrong?\r\nWhy haven't we heard from him? We can't just leave him out there all alone. ",
        "Mallet: You here, Gus there. ",
        "Harley: Okay. ",
        "Mallet: Okay. ",
        "Harley: Great. Smart. ",
        "Mallet: Thank you. Good night. ",
        "Harley: Give it. ",
        "Mallet: You are being very grabby. You know,\r\nsome people might call that sexual harassment. ",
        "Harley: Give me the key. ",
        "Mallet: Nope. I have to protect you and Gus.\r\n( Groans ) ",
        "Harley: You're not interested in protecting\r\nGus. You want to replace him. ",
        "",
        "Ross: Hello, Alex. ",
        "Alexandra: Oh, hello, Ross. ",
        "Ross: Are you here for the fireworks? ",
        "Alexandra: Oh, well, that's just an act, you\r\nknow. ",
        "Ross: Yeah, I figured as much. So the\r\nSpauldings and the Coopers, the Montagues and the Capulets, kept apart in spite\r\nof their overwhelming love for each other. ",
        "Alexandra: ( Laughs ) well, then, you know\r\nwhat happened to Romeo and Juliet. ",
        "Ross: You're being a little melodramatic,\r\naren't you? ",
        "Alexandra: This Coop-Lizzie situation is...\r\nwell, it's just the kind of thing that can throw... send Alan right over the\r\nedge, huh? ",
        "Ross: I think Alan has been teetering on the\r\nedge ever since Phillip died. ",
        "Alexandra: Well, don't worry about it, Ross.\r\nI'm handling everything. ",
        "",
        "Coop: Lizzie, I can't do this anymore, okay?\r\n",
        "Lizzie: I thought you said you didn't worry\r\nabout my Granddad. ",
        "Coop: This is not working, all right? For me\r\nor for you. ",
        "Lizzie: Are you dumping me? ",
        "Coop: No, I'm not dumping you. I'm just saying\r\nthat I'm tired of hiding this, I'm tired of keeping secrets. All right? You may\r\nbe a spoiled little rich brat, but you're my spoiled little rich brat, and I'm\r\nnot going to let anybody-- anybody-- come between us. All right? Unless, well,\r\nyou want to get rid of me? ",
        "Lizzie: Oh, stop it. Don't even say that.\r\nLike, what do you mean, you can't do this anymore if... ",
        "Coop: Because we can't do anything here at\r\nCompany, all right? I'm tired of trying to sneak into the supply room just to\r\nget a kiss or touch your hand over by the trash can. All right, that's not a\r\nrelationship. ",
        "Lizzie: I understand that, but that's just\r\nhow it's going to have to be for a little while. My Granddad doesn\u2019t... ",
        "Coop: I don't care about your Granddad,\r\nokay? I don't care about Alan. Like I told Alex, all right, I'm serious here.\r\nAre you? ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. ",
        "Coop: Then come away with me. ",
        "",
        "Alan: What do you want? ",
        "Waiter: Room service. I have your meal, sir.\r\n",
        "Alan: Come in, come in. No one followed you\r\noff the elevator, did they? I mean, it's very important. ",
        "Waiter: No, no. ",
        "Alan: And no one knows about this room,\r\nright? ",
        "Waiter: No one, sir. ",
        "Alan: Good. Look, I'm sorry I'm a little\r\njumpy. It's just... I'm kind of stressed and tired. And I'm also wondering why\r\nyou're not asking me the obvious question: \"Mr. Spaulding, what are you\r\ndoing here instead of that big house you have, huh?\" ",
        "Ross: Yeah, Mr. Spaulding. Why aren't you in\r\nthat great big house of yours? ",
        "Alan: Ross, what are you doing here? ",
        "Ross: I have an apartment and an office\r\nhere. How about you? ",
        "Alan: Well, I just... I just needed a little\r\ntime away from the family and a little time on my own. Here you go. Here, just\r\ntake it. ",
        "Waiter: Wow. ",
        "Alan: Thank you. ",
        "Waiter: Thank you. ",
        "Ross: Does Alexandra know that you're here? ",
        "Alan: Why does she have to know I'm here,\r\nRoss? I'm not a three-year-old. I can go anywhere, do anything I please. ",
        "Ross: Alan, are you okay? ",
        "Alan: I'm just tired, that's all. And I'm\r\nvery hungry. Would you like to join me? ",
        "Ross: No, no. I got some takeout because I\r\nwanted to do some work while I eat. ",
        "Alan: Do you smell that? ",
        "Ross: Smell what? ",
        "Alan: It\u2019s... it smells like almonds.\r\nCyanide smells like almonds. ",
        "",
        "Sebastian: What the hell are you doing here,\r\nGus? I thought you were... ",
        "Gus: What? ",
        "Sebastian: Hiding out with Harley. Where is\r\nyour lady love? ",
        "Gus: I will be asking the questions here.\r\nYou understand? ",
        "Sebastian: Okay. You know, take it easy.\r\nI'll answer. ",
        "Gus: What are you doing here? What are you\r\ndoing here in New\r\n  York City? ",
        "Sebastian: What am I doing here? Your father\r\nsent me to find you, Gus. He misses you. ",
        "Gus: He misses me? ",
        "Sebastian: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Gus: I think you'll have to do a little\r\nbetter than that. ",
        "Sebastian: Can't do much better than the\r\ntruth. ",
        "Gus: What are you doing here, posing as Dr.\r\nWallace's brother? ",
        "Sebastian: ( Sighs ) It's the only lead we\r\nhad, okay? Alan caught wind of the hit and run, there was a description of the\r\nwitnesses, he thought it was you and Harley, and you know, Alan... ",
        "Gus: Oh, so Alan figured it all out from the\r\ndescription? A blonde girl and a guy with dark hair? Like that doesn't fit a\r\nmillion descriptions of people that live in New York City? ",
        "Sebastian: Well, maybe, but there aren't a\r\nmillion doctors that worked at Cedars the night Phillip died. ",
        "Gus: You're telling me that Dr. Wallace\r\nworked at Cedars that night? ",
        "Sebastian: Yeah. And Alan thought that maybe\r\nyou and Harley were on to something, and he thought that if I found Wallace,\r\nthen I'd find you, and... ( Laughs ) ...he was right. ",
        "Gus: Oh. Well, you found me. So now what? ",
        "Sebastian: Alan wants to hire a team of\r\nattorneys, the best money can buy. He wants you to come home, Gus, and you're\r\nnot going to serve a year. ",
        "Gus: I'm not interested. I'm not interested.\r\n",
        "Sebastian: It's a good offer, Gus. Come on.\r\nYour father loves you. ",
        "Gus: Let me tell you something: I don't care\r\nabout my father. Do you understand? So the only way I'm going anywhere is if\r\nyou take me, and I highly suggest against it. ",
        "",
        "Harley: There was a good half hour there\r\nwhere you let me believe that Gus was dead. ",
        "Mallet: It was the only way I could get you\r\nto leave with me. ",
        "Harley: No, no, no, because even after we\r\nleft the TV station and we came back here, you still let me believe the worst. ",
        "Mallet: I tried to tell you, but you're\r\ndoing exactly now what you did then-- actually, what you've done since the day\r\none I met you. You just keep talking and talking like you know everything and\r\nto hell with what anybody else has to say. ",
        "Harley: \"A,\" that's not true, and\r\n\"B,\" all you had to say was three words, three little tiny words: Gus\r\nis alive. Not even big words. But did you do that? No. Instead you chose to\r\nreach into my soul and rip my heart out. You gutted me like a fish! ",
        "Mallet: See? See? You're doing it again. You\r\njust keep talking, you don't let me explain. That was one of the problems when\r\nwe were married. ",
        "Harley: What? ",
        "Mallet: What? ",
        "Harley: So now you're blaming our marital\r\nproblems on me? Oh, I'm sorry, that's right. It was all my talking that made\r\nyou go to bed with Slutty Jones. ",
        "Mallet: Her name was Kingsley. Slutty\r\nKingsley. ( Laughs ) What? ",
        "Harley: Are you making a joke? ",
        "Mallet: No. Look, I've made mistakes, okay?\r\nI'm sorry. ",
        "Harley: No, no, no, no, no. Staking out your\r\npartner in a cruiser while lying to your wife, that's not a mistake. ",
        "Mallet: I blew it. Okay? And I'm sorry. And\r\nI've proven it by putting my life on the line, helping you escape from prison.\r\nOh, and by the way, I think I had something to do with the fact that you're\r\nstill breathing? ",
        "Harley: Which is the other thing. Why are\r\nyou here? Why am I conveniently locked in a hotel room with you, while Gus is\r\nthe one who's out there risking his life? ",
        "Mallet: Because somebody had to draw the\r\nshort straw and I guess it was me. Do you think I came up with all this just so\r\nI could be alone with you? I've got news for you, honey, okay? You're not the\r\nonly one that's moved on. I'm completely over you. ",
        "Harley: Really? ",
        "Mallet: Yeah, that's right. I look at you\r\nand I see the past. Nothing else. So stop flattering yourself, okay? I don't\r\nwant you anymore. ",
        "Harley: Good. ",
        "",
        "Alan: Does it smell like almonds or not? ",
        "Ross: I'm not sure almonds even have a\r\nsmell. ",
        "Alan: Yes, but cyanide does, Ross. ",
        "Ross: This is taking me back to my youth,\r\nwhen dear old Mom used to cook up that cyanide casserole. ",
        "Alan: Look, maybe it's the cold medication\r\nthey gave me. I can't smell very well. It... the salmon looks pretty good,\r\nthough, doesn't it? Why don\u2019t... why don't you try it? ",
        "Ross: You mean I should try it first, see if\r\nI live? Alan, who would try to poison you? ",
        "Alan: Who wouldn't? I'm Alan Spaulding. ",
        "Ross: I mean, do you know that somebody is\r\nout to get you? ",
        "Alan: No. ",
        "Ross: Alan. ",
        "Alan: I mean, I just read this article about\r\nthis woman who poisoned her husband with cyanide. I just read it recently, and\r\nI guess that's on my mind. You know how that goes, Ross. ",
        "Ross: No, I'm not sure that I do. ",
        "Alan: You know, I think it would be best if\r\nI was left alone. ",
        "Ross: I think it would be best if you came\r\nupstairs and had dinner with us, where there's no cyanide and I won't let Blake\r\ncook. ",
        "Alan: Well, I appreciate that offer, but I'm\r\nvery tired and also thinking about the loss of my sons. And I think it'd be\r\nbest if I were alone. ",
        "Ross: Sons? ",
        "Alan: Son. Phillip. So, please, if you don't\r\nmind.",
        "Ross: Alan? You call me if you need\r\nanything. ",
        "Alan: What I need, Ross, you can't give me. ",
        "",
        "Sebastian: I didn't come here to fight with\r\nyou, okay? I'm just your father's emissary. ",
        "Gus: Right. Right, because my father's so\r\nworried about me. ",
        "Sebastian: Mm-hmm. The man wants his son\r\nback. Is that so hard to believe? ",
        "Gus: The man wants Harley. That's what he's\r\nafter, okay, and he ain\u2019t ever going to find her. So I've got a message for my\r\nfather and I think you know what it is, and the same goes for you. ( Cell phone\r\nrings ) ",
        "Sebastian: Excuse me. Alan. I have great\r\nnews. I found your son. ",
        "Alan: Is Gus...? ",
        "Sebastian: He's alive and well in New York City. ",
        "Alan: ( Relieved sigh ) ",
        "Sebastian: Alan? You still there? Hello? ",
        "Alan: I'm here. You're sure he's fine. ",
        "Sebastian: I would stake your fortune on it.\r\n",
        "Alan: Where is he? ",
        "Sebastian: Damned if I know, Alan. I had him\r\nand then all of a sudden he was gone, just like that. I don't know. I suspect\r\nmaybe he's hooked up with Harley and Mallet. I told you not to trust that guy. ",
        "Alan: I want you to find them, find all of\r\nthem. And when you do... ",
        "Sebastian: I will, and you'll be the first\r\nto know, Alan, old boy. I'll talk to you later. ",
        "Gus: Why didn't you tell him where I was? ",
        "Sebastian: Because you and I want the same\r\nthing, Gus. ",
        "Gus: Oh, really? ",
        "Sebastian: You want to lose Alan and I want\r\nyou to get lost. ",
        "Gus: Really? ",
        "Sebastian: Yeah. ",
        "Gus: And why is that? ",
        "Sebastian: Because with you out of the\r\npicture, I get to become the son that Alan doesn't have anymore. The one that\r\nhe relies on. ",
        "Gus: ( Laughs ) So you want to be Alan\u2019s\r\nson? ",
        "Sebastian: Yeah. I hunger for a father; Alan\r\nwants a son. ",
        "Gus: Right. ",
        "Sebastian: And you know what? Truth be told,\r\nI'm getting kind of attached to the old man. ",
        "Gus: I don't really think you know what\r\nyou're getting yourself into, but you want to be a Spaulding, that's great,\r\nbecause... but I'll warn you; it's hazardous to your health. ",
        "Sebastian: I have a killer immune system. ",
        "Gus: Do you? ",
        "Sebastian: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Gus: You know your explanation, it's a\r\nlittle too simple for me. ",
        "Sebastian: It's because it is simple, Gus.\r\nYou go your way, I go mine. We both get what we want. ",
        "Gus: And I highly suggest you don't try\r\nfollowing me to get to Harley. ",
        "Sebastian: I am not going to follow you,\r\nGus. I promise. I'm not going to follow you for at least 30 more seconds. Yes. ",
        "Gus: You don't think I trusted you, did you?\r\n",
        "Sebastian: What did you...? ",
        "Gus: Did you? Huh? How about a little\r\nnighty-night juice? ",

        "Lizzie: Coop? Oh, he's so annoying. ",
        "Alexandra: Of course he is, dear. ",
        "Lizzie: No, Aunt Alex, I mean it. He really\r\nis. ",
        "Alexandra: Yes, yes. And you, you're an\r\nabsolutely wonderful little actress. But, then, I know better, don't I? ",
        "Lizzie: Aunt Alex, I think it's safer for\r\nyou if Granddad thinks you're on his side.",
        "Alexandra: I am on his side. And you are\r\nplaying with fire. ",
        "Lizzie: I know. ",
        "Alexandra: No. I've tried to help you both out,\r\nbut, you know, this time its different, my dear. I cannot control your\r\ngrandfather like I used to, okay? Now, if he finds out that you and Coop are\r\nstill seeing... ",
        "Lizzie: He won't find out. We're careful. ",
        "Alexandra: One little slip, Lizzie. I mean it.\r\nAnyway, darling, you don't have to worry because your grandfather loves you so\r\nvery, very much. But honey... ",
        "Lizzie: You're right. I know what I have to\r\ndo. I'll be right back. Excuse me. So do you still want me to come away with\r\nyou? ",
        "Coop: ( Clears throat ) Well, I'm not\r\ntalking about eloping, here. I'm just thinking that there's a music festival\r\ngoing on this weekend up in Cleveland,\r\nso I thought we might be able to take a drive and maybe stay overnight. ",
        "Lizzie: Wait, you mean like stay in a hotel together?\r\n",
        "Coop: No, I'm thinking more along the lines\r\nof a sleeping bag and, if the festival grounds allow it, maybe camping out\r\nthere, and... well, come on. Does that sound good? ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. It sounds really good. But how\r\ndoes that whole sleeping bag thing work? Like, do you need to bring a mattress,\r\nor... ",
        "Coop: No. Let me take care of the\r\narrangements, okay? What I need for you to do is I need for you to find\r\nsomebody, preferably Alex, to cover for you. That's all. ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, she's out. We're definitely\r\ngoing to need somebody with innovative thinking and nerves of steel and\r\nsomebody who doesn't mind stretching the truth a little. ",
        "Coop: Okay, so who do you have in mind? ",
        "Lizzie: You're looking at her. ",

        "Harley: So you're really over me? ",
        "Mallet: Yep. You bet I am. ",
        "Harley: You're not just saying that because\r\nyou think that's what I want to hear? ",
        "Mallet: Would you like it better if I said\r\n\"I can't live without you\"? ",
        "Harley: Of course not. Well, maybe. ",
        "Mallet: So you want me to suffer and live\r\nbrokenhearted for the rest of my life while you and Gus live happily ever\r\nafter? ",
        "Harley: Yes. ",
        "Mallet: Well, that's real nice. I just want\r\nyou to be happy and you just want me to suffer. ",
        "Harley: Well, you wanted to hear the truth. ",
        "Mallet: Well, I didn't say that. ",
        "Harley: You are so not over me. ",
        "Mallet: What makes you so sure of that? ",
        "Harley: Because you're here. And because I'm\r\nun-get-over-able. ",
        "Mallet: ( Laughs ) Un-get-over-able? Really?\r\n",
        "Harley: Yes. And what we had was... thanks. ",
