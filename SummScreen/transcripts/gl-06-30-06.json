        "Reva wakes from surgery insisting that Collin allow her to call Josh. He stops her by saying that if she calls Josh will come running to her. Lizzie goes out onto the Cedars hospital roof in hopes of getting Coops' attention and winds up in danger when the scaffolding she's on breaks from the building. She's eventually rescued by Gus. Tammy goes to meet Jonathan in the islands, unaware that Alan has been there to persuade Jonathan to sign over custody of the baby. Alan offers Jonathan a weekly bank deposit and the house. Tammy is not aware the house is a gift from Alan, provided Jonathan signs away his rights to his grandchild. Jonathan lies to Tammy saying he mortgaged the bar to buy the house. Tammy tells Jonathan that she had to take Lizzie to the hospital but that everything with the baby is fine. Gus is at Cedars for a Narcotics anonymous meeting when a nurse tells him that someone is on the roof about to jump. Gus eventually rescues Lizzie with Harley looking on. Gus and Harley talk at their shell of a house. Alan and Beth agree that there can't be anymore episodes like that from Lizzie and that maybe Lizzie isn't fit to raise her own child."

        "Reva: Joshua. I have to call him... now.",
        "Colin: Reva, you just got out of surgery.",
        "Reva: I... I just, I... I had a dream where I tried to tell him why I've been keeping this a secret. And he couldn't see.",
        "Colin: You'll have a chance later on.",
        "Reva: No. There's no time. What if I never come home from this place, Colin? I have to tell him while I still can...",
        "Colin: No, Reva. Please. Wait.",

        "Josh: Hey, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Josh, hi. Has Reva checked in yet?",
        "Josh: Uh, not with me, no. Do you have a second? I want to talk to you about something.",
        "Cassie: Um, something about the project?",
        "Josh: Sort of, yes. I'm kind of thinking this, I've been spending a lot of time on the phone with contractors and then dealing with emails and faxes, here. So I was thinking that it might be easier for me if I were actually there on site managing the project myself.",
        "Cassie: You mean you'd go to Oklahoma and leave Springfield?",
        "Josh: Yeah. Why not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Remy: Tammy, what does Jonathan say?",

        "Remy: You're kidding.",
        "Tammy: He says he needed a little time away after everything that happened with Lizzie. He wants me to meet him. He says there's a ticket for me at the airport.",
        "Remy: Are you going? Tammy, first the guy disappears, then he sends you a ticket to who knows where, and you off and go?",
        "Tammy: I know what I'm doing. I know where I'm going, I know...",
        "Cassie: Going?",
        "Tammy: Mom. Uncle Josh...",
        "Cassie: Where are you off to?",
        "Tammy: Uh... Jonathan. We need some time to work everything out, so I'm going to meet him. But don't worry, it's no biggie. I'll see you guys soon.",

        "Jonathan: Where you been?",
        "Alan: Good morning, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: What took you so long?",
        "Alan: Did you miss me?",
        "Jonathan: I'm not going to miss when I take a swing.",
        "Alan: Oh, my, my, and I thought a few days out here in paradise, away from all your distractions back in Springfield, would have mellowed you. Tell me. Did you sleep well out here?",
        "Jonathan: Would have slept a lot better if Tammy was with me. Where is she? I warned you, if you screw me over on this...",
        "Alan: She will be here shortly. You will sleep with her tonight with a big smile on your face. All you have to do... is sign on the dotted line, and we will all have reason to smile.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Now don't worry, baby Jenna. Mommy wouldn't dream of hurting you. We just... need to make daddy Henry remember how much we mean to him.",

        "Gus: Multi-purpose room.",
        "Nurse: Detective Aitoro. There's somebody out on the roof. It looks like they're planning to jump.",
        "Gus: All right, you call 911, you tell them the hospital has a jumper, okay? You tell them I'm here and to bring the trampolines and nets. Then you tell your security guards to clear all the entrances and exits, all right? Thank you.",

        "Frank: Hey, sis.",

        "Frank: He finished it!",
        "Harley: Who?",
        "Frank: Unbelievable! Gus. He was all stressed out trying to get this thing ready for Jude. Wow.",
        "Harley: He doesn't even like doing stuff like this. He's not very good at it, either.",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, he's actually working pretty hard at piecing his life together, so...",
        "Harley: You're defending Gus?",
        "Frank: This time, I am.",
        "Harley: Wow. I guess being with Olivia has made you a little more... flexible? How are you guys?",
        "Frank: That's a very a good question, actually. You know, one step forward, two steps back, but, uh... I'm hanging in.",
        "Harley: Well, you know, I think she's lucky.",
        "Frank: Thank you, sis.",
        "Harley: (Laughs) I miss him. I do. I miss him, I miss him a lot. I want to believe that he's clean this time, and that he'll stay that way. Because I need him, I need our life back.",
        "Frank: Well... you going to give him another chance?",
        "Harley: I just don't want to make the same dumb mistake again. (Cell phone rings)",
        "Frank: Sorry. Cooper here. What?!",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Frank: Uh, I'm on my way. There's a jumper on top of Cedars. Gus called it in, and he's actually on his way over there to talk them down, so...",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Now don't worry, baby Jenna. Coop is going to come running as soon as he hears. As soon as he hears, he is going to remember how much he loves us... and how much he needs us. No big deal. (Screams) Oh, my God! Oh, my God! This isn't the way it's supposed to happen! I don't actually want to die, I just want to be with Coop. Ay it's not moving. That's good. Just need to get back up onto the roof. (Screams) Okay, all right, I just... I just can't look down anymore. Okay, that's it, I'm not going to look down. I'm not looking down. Okay. I can go. You've got to be kidding me. Ow! Ow. Ow, ow! No, okay. Baby, I've got you. We're not going to fall.",

        "Gus: No, no, there won't be any of that kind of talk now, okay?",
        "Lizzie: I don't, I just don't want my baby to fall, okay? This isn't her fault!",

        "Jonathan: How did you get her to come?",
        "Alan: I didn't. You did. You bought her a ticket and left her a beautiful text message.",
        "Jonathan: I did?",
        "Alan: Yeah. Heartfelt. Didn't know you had it in you. I would, uh... read that contract, if I were you.",
        "Jonathan: Fine. I knew there'd be a catch.",
        "Alan: It's nothing you can't live with.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, you figured you'd throw in the house and that would seal the deal? You know, the view of the ocean's nice, but...",
        "Alan: It's not just a house, Jonathan, it's your future. Yours and Tammy's. I'll be making a deposit each week to an account for you. Billy Lewis will be taking care of your bar back in Springfield. Your dream with Tammy and paradise is all coming through. All you have to do is sign on the dotted line that you will relinquish all rights to Elizabeth's baby.",

        "Lizzie: I think that was my baby's way of telling me I'm supposed to be taking care of her. I can't help it! Oh!",
        "Gus: What, what, what? What is it?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, I shouldn't have looked down, now everything's spinning! Gus, I'm going to fall!",
        "Gus: Just listen to me! Nothing's going to happen to you, okay? Just listen to the sound of my voice. Just breathe in deep, okay, and now I want you to open... are your eyes open? Just look out to the horizon. I want you to look out straight to the horizon.",
        "Lizzie: Okay.",
        "Gus: Okay, Lizzie, how did you get yourself into this mess? I don't understand.",
        "Lizzie: I wasn't going to jump.",
        "Gus: Well, I'm glad to hear that.",
        "Lizzie: I just wanted him to think that I was.",
        "Gus: Who, Coop?",
        "Lizzie: I don't know, I thought maybe he'd rescue me. As soon as he heard, he'd come running. What am I going to do, Gus? It hurts so much.",

        "Josh: Oh, uh... no more than usual.",
        "Cassie: (Laughs) Oh, gee, thank you. See, now if you go to Oklahoma, what ever will I do without someone to give me such great advice like that? (Laughs)",
        "Josh: So you're okay with it. I mean with me, um, going down there for a little while. Cassie?",
        "Cassie: Josh, no! No, I would hate it. You are the best part of my day! I need you here. You give me reason to wake up in the morning.",
        "Josh: Cassie? Thank you very much. Look, don't worry about Tammy, okay? She's going to be fine. She's following her heart.",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Josh: You can't stop that.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I know. And... we should all follow our hearts. So if yours is telling you that you need to go and manage the project on site, then I think it's a... I think it's a good idea.",
        "Josh: Really?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, with Reva away... why not? Go and get your hands dirty, and watch your daddy's dream coming true, and... you know, we'll all miss you, but...",
        "Josh: But follow my heart. I get it. Okay, um, that's yours. I'll see you.",
        "Cassie: See you, Josh. (Sighs)",

        "Reva: Give me the phone.",
        "Colin: Not yet.",
        "Reva: Are you afraid that if I call my family and something goes wrong, they're going to sue you?",
        "Colin: Hardly. I've always wanted you to tell your husband, but you're the one who's insisted from the very beginning on keeping him in the dark about your illness.",
        "Reva: So?",
        "Colin: It's not about what I think. So... I know a spur of the moment decision when I see one, and I don't believe in them.",
        "Reva: No kidding.",
        "Colin: Look, if you want to tell Josh, if you've really changed your mind about that, then I'll dial for you. But you have to be prepared for what comes next. I mean, you tell your husband, five minutes later he's going to be on a plane. Next thing you know, he'll be right here in this room, and you'll never be able to stop him from trying to protect you and comfort you day and night. Now, for most people... most normal people... that would be a good thing. The question is, what do you think? Reva?",
        "Reva: Hey, it's me. I need you... I didn't... I didn't want to have to do this.",
        "Billy: So how'd it go? How are you feeling?",
        "Reva: Okay, I guess, but I need your help, Billy.",
        "Billy: Whatever you need, darling.",

        "Lizzie: (Groans) Ow!",
        "Gus: Hang on, Lizzie.",
        "Frank: I'm going to go make some calls. Don't do anything, sis, you stay put.",
        "Lizzie: Ow!",
        "Gus: Same thing as you, Lizzie. I've wanted to crawl out on a few ledges lately. Actually, I have... what is on this?",
        "Lizzie: I don't know! How do you do it, huh?",
        "Gus: Ow!",
        "Lizzie: Because I don't get it. I don't know how I'm supposed to keep going, okay? Everybody that I know, practically everybody that I know has left me. And I thought that having this baby was going to make me feel important. I just feel really alone.",
        "Gus: You're not alone, Lizzie. You've got your favorite uncle.",
        "Lizzie: Favorite?",
        "Gus: That's right, I'd like to think so.",
        "Lizzie: Ow!",
        "Gus: Okay, hang on. Almost got this rope off your feet.",
        "Lizzie: What's that sound? Those sirens, they're not for me, are they?",
        "Gus: Yes, they are.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, no, no, no. That means pictures and newspapers and they're going to call my mom and everybody's going to know what a mess I am! I'm going to be crazy Lizzie again!",
        "Gus: No, you're not, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: God, I don't deserve to have this baby. I don't deserve to have Coop! Oh! (Screams)",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: What do you need, Reva?",
        "Reva: I need you to keep an eye on Josh for me. The last thing I wanted to do was distract him. The project has made him so happy. And he needs to keep his focus on that, so if he starts asking about me... you need to change the subject.",
        "Billy: I'll try.",
        "Reva: You have to promise me, Billy, that you'll keep an eye on him.",
        "Billy: I'll try.",
        "Reva: We'll talk later.",
        "Billy: Reva? (Door slams)",
        "Josh: Oh, how nice, what is this? Did Reva leave something behind, ask you to come by and pick it up for her, maybe hop on a plane, take it to her? Is that it?",
        "Billy: Um... look, Josh. It's not what you think.",
        "Josh: Really? Then what is it, Billy? Go ahead, explain it to me.",

I'd love to be the gladiator in the gladiator movie. Well, my free time, I do a lot of boating. Actually, I don't do any boating, I'm just fixing a boat. So eventually I'm going to go boating.

        "Billy: Listen, Josh...",
        "Josh: You know what? Don't. Don't say anything, because Reva's all ready given me all of her... excuse me... all of her excuses. And I am not a big fan of recap.",
        "Billy: Um... are you mad, or are you worried?",
        "Josh: I don't know, Billy, what do you think, should I be worried?",
        "Billy: Josh, she's worried about you, okay? Hey, once she gets back, everything's going to be fine.",
        "Josh: Oh, thank you so much for sharing that with me. I personally can't wait to get on the plane to Tulsa and leave all this behind me.",
        "Billy: Wait, you're going to Tulsa?",
        "Josh: Yeah, I'm going to Tulsa. I'm going to stay there from now till the project's finished. Do you have a problem with that?",
        "Billy: Josh, come on, you can't leave right now. Hey, when she gets back from Minnesota visiting that friend of...",
        "Josh: Friend? Huh.",
        "Billy: Yeah, look, come on, Josh! Okay, she's being Reva. You be Josh, be that pillar for her. I mean, you know she's going to make everything all right with you when she gets back.",
        "Josh: (Laughs) Yeah, just like she always does.",
        "Billy: Right.",
        "Josh: Are you done? Because I'm done. I've got things to do. Excuse me.",

        "Colin: Well, I prefer being inside, staying busy, but if someone forces me outside...",
        "Reva: So says doctor McVampire.",
        "Colin: Then something like this, sort of private, quiet... is, you know, my kind of outside.",
        "Reva: I don't understand you.",
        "Colin: You're not the first.",
        "Reva: You act like you care... actually, that you don't care very much about people, and yet... you spend every minute you're awake taking care of them. All your time and all of your energy. How did you get here? Colin?",

        "Jonathan: Uh... uh, what?",
        "Tammy: How'd you find it, how long are you going to stay here? Why didn't you tell me you were leaving, Jonathan? Why are you here? Did you think that when I told you I needed time, that I was planning to leave you? Did you come to some sort of decision about Lizzie's baby? Feel free to jump in with an answer, any answer...",
        "Jonathan: I don't have an answer. I have a question. Did you come here to be with me? If you say yes, we'll make it forever. I needed to clear my mind and think about how I could get you back. That's why I came here. Remember, like you were saying? Like you needed time away and you needed to get out of town? Well, that's what I needed, too. And you... you have to be in my life, Tammy. Nothing else matters.",
        "Tammy: Your baby?",
        "Jonathan: I want a life with you. That's all I want. Can we do that? Have you forgiven me?",
        "Tammy: Forgiving you is not the point. We have to fix this. You have to find a way to do that first.",
        "Jonathan: Well, I made a good start. I 'fessed up about being the father of the kid, now everyone knows. I did what Reva wanted. But what I want has been the same since day one. It's you, Tammy. That's never changed for me.",

        "Lizzie: No, it isn't!",
        "Gus: Lizzie, all those guys down there? They're just doing their job. You know, it's just protocol type thing. Listen, I want you to step your feet of this rope when I count to three, okay? One, two, three.",
        "Lizzie: (Shrieks)",
        "Gus: All right, Lizzie, I'm going to tell you a secret, okay? It's my secret. When I'm in pain with something like this, over love, what you got to do is breathe. It takes you from this moment to the next moment. Understand? And then what you do is, you think about the people that you love and who need you and want you, like your grandpa and Lillian and your crazy aunt Alex, okay? And then you breathe. And it takes you from that moment to the next moment. Do you understand me? Now, I want you to think about the child that you're going to be bringing into this world, and how that child is going to need you and want you. Your baby is going to need you. It needs you.",
        "Lizzie: Her. Her.",
        "Gus: Her, right, her. Well, and I'm sure she's going to grow up just as beautiful as her mommy.",

        "Lizzie: I'm going to be the worst mother there ever was.",
        "Gus: That's not true, that's not true. You know why that's not true? Because your daughter won't let that happen. They change you, Lizzie. You'll see. You'll see, I believe in you.",
        "Lizzie: You do?",
        "Gus: Yes, I do. Okay, listen, this is what's going to happen. I'm going to stand up. You can hang on, and I'm going to stand back on this rail. You're going to give me your hands, okay? And I'm going to pull you off. Okay, now just hold... you got it?",
        "Lizzie: Okay... yeah...",
        "Gus: Okay. Put your hands on the top rail, both hands.",
        "Lizzie: Oh!",
        "Gus: Okay. I'm going to leave for just a second.",
        "Lizzie: Okay... (wails)",
        "Gus: All right, ready? All right. Your right hand first. Come on.",
        "Lizzie: I can't!",
        "Gus: Come on, yes, you can. Come on, come on. This way, that a girl. That's it.",
        "Lizzie: Oh! (Crying)",
        "Gus: Okay... okay.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, my God, thank you!",
        "Gus: It's okay. It's okay.",
        "Lizzie: I didn't mean it, I... I really didn't want to die.",
        "Gus: I know, I know. I know. I know, honey, I know.",

        "Jonathan: I missed you so much.",
        "Tammy: I missed you, too.",
        "Jonathan: Are you okay?",
        "Tammy: You still haven't told me whose house this is.",
        "Jonathan: It's mine. It's ours.",
        "Tammy: We barely had enough money to pay for our room at the Beacon, so how?",
        "Jonathan: I have everything under control this time. Outskirts is open, so I borrowed against it.",
        "Tammy: The bar as collateral?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, why not? I mean, to have a time like this... Tammy. It's crazy out there. And here, it's... it's ocean and sand and trees and pillows and... we can stay as long as we want to.",
        "Tammy: No, we can't.",
        "Jonathan: I thought about that, too.",
        "Tammy: No, it's... it's more than that, I know what I'm talking about, all right? Don't forget that I grew up without a dad until my mom married Richard. Your baby needs you.",
        "Jonathan: What about what I need? What, you want me to stay chained to Lizzie Spaulding and her crazy family for the rest of my life? Is that what you think is good for me?",
        "Tammy: No. But you can't change it now. I'm just thinking about what's best for the long run. For you and your baby. That's why I took Lizzie to the hospital.",
        "Jonathan: The hospital? Is the baby...?",
        "Tammy: See, you do care. And everything's fine, Lizzie and the baby are fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Go ahead and sit down.",
        "Beth: What happened? What were you doing up there?!",
        "Lizzie: Okay, I'm sorry! It was really stupid, okay? I won't ever do anything like that again. But I'm fine. I won't. Just please don't tell Coop.",
        "Frank: Whoa, hold on. You went out there for Coop?",
        "Gus: Frank...",
        "Frank: Oh, this is unbelievable.",
        "Gus: She got herself into a little bit of a bind, okay? She was trying to figure something out, but... the worst is behind us, and it's over, okay? I'm sure Beth can write a check for all the emergency services.",
        "Lizzie: The baby kicked.",
        "Beth: What?",
        "Lizzie: When we were out there, she kicked. It was so weird, I've never felt anything like that before in my life.",
        "Beth: Oh...",
        "Frank: Excuse me, do you know how much manpower and money you have wasted by this little stunt?",
        "Beth: Frank, can you give it a rest? I'll write you a check right now.",
        "Frank: No, that's not the point that I'm trying to make here, Beth.",
        "Beth: Haven't you done anything crazy for love ever in your life?",
        "Frank: No comment. Look, just as long as no one got hurt here, I guess we can all move on, right?",
        "Gus: Okay, we're all going to move on. All behind us. You know, Lizzie... sometimes the only thing that a person needs is another chance. Just depends on what they do with that chance. Take it easy, okay?",
        "Lizzie: Thank you.",
        "Gus: Another time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: That story doesn't fly. There's no one like me.",
        "Colin: Yeah, well maybe... (laughs) Not nearly half as irritating, but Maggie was a handful.",
        "Reva: Who's Maggie?",
        "Colin: Maggie was, uh... my sister. My twin sister.",
        "Reva: Twin sister?",
        "Colin: She was my best friend.",
        "Reva: Cancer?",
        "Colin: Yeah, she, uh, died on our 24th birthday. I got the call right after I finished my midterm exams. Grad school, chemistry, you know, 4.0 and all that, that was me.",
        "Reva: I guess you weren't even going to be a doctor.",
        "Colin: Hm, no. I applied to med school the next week.",
        "Reva: You wanted to be an Oncologist so you could help other people who had what your sister had?",
        "Colin: Oh, no, no. Nothing as noble as that. I, uh, I just want to get revenge on this... this thing that took my sister away from me.",
        "Reva: You wanted revenge against cancer.",
        "Colin: Yeah, I know it's not rational, but... you know, when someone comes to me, I don't see a person, I just see... I see... I see an opportunity, a battle. One more fight, one more chance, maybe this time, I'll get what I'm looking for. Maybe this time I'll get justice.",
        "Reva: You're not nearly as cold as you want other people to think you are.",
        "Colin: Well, you're not nearly as tough as you want other people to think you are. What's your point?",
        "Reva: My point? I don't want to die, Colin. That's my point.",
        "Colin: Good. Because I'm not going to let you die.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: I can do this. Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: I made a big mistake. And so did Lizzie. But I want the baby to be okay.",
        "Tammy: Of course you do. So do I. One thing I will never make you do is choose between me and your daughter.",
        "Jonathan: Okay, okay. Let's talk about all this later. We'll talk it through later, I promise. But... we're here. Alone. We're here alone.",
        "Tammy: For once.",
        "Jonathan: I love you.",
        "Tammy: I love you.",

        "Alan: How is the baby?",
        "Beth: The baby is fine, and so is Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Look, I'm so sorry!",
        "Alan: We're certain that there's no complications with the child, at all?",
        "Beth: Alan, Alan, we're waiting right now for somebody to come and do a full check-up. And Frank Cooper is insisting that a consulting psychiatrist be called.",
        "Alan: No, no, I will take care of Frank. There's no...",
        "Lizzie: No, no, Granddad. I want to do everything that I can to make sure that this baby has a chance to be as strong and as healthy as she possibly could be. You know, when I was out there... right when I thought that I might die, she kicked.",
        "Alan: The baby kicked?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, she did! And it changed something in me. It changed everything right in that moment, I got it. I understood that... this is real. And there is someone real... inside of me. And she's my daughter.",
        "Nurse: Dr. Sedwick will be here in a moment. But first I need to get your vitals. Would you excuse us?",
        "Beth: Oh. Yeah, sure.",
        "Lizzie: Mom? I will never do anything like this again. I will be better. Just like Uncle Gus said, I have to be. For my baby.",
        "Beth: We'll be right outside, waiting for you.",
        "Alan: Well, how did this happen? She put that child's life on the line, Beth!",
        "Beth: Both their lives, Alan. Thank goodness both of them are okay.",
        "Alan: What about next time? I'm concerned that she's going to do it...",
        "Beth: There can't be a next time. We have to make sure of that. I hate to say this, but I don't think that Lizzie is up to this. Being a mother, raising a child.",
        "Alan: And being a child herself. Well, I've just had some conversations with Mr. Randall, and it's only a matter of time before he signs away all of his rights to Lizzie's baby.",
        "Beth: So that's where you were?",
        "Alan: Taking care of the family. Thank goodness Lizzie's child has us.",
        "Beth: Thank God for that.",

        "Gus: Oh, so it's you?",
        "Harley: Yeah. You know, just because I'm here, it doesn't mean...",
        "Gus: Look, whatever. I'm here, you're here... we're both here.",
        "Harley: Yeah, it's just... you know, before we can even think about...",
        "Gus: Before you say anything, I just want you to know... that I'm clean.",
        "Harley: I know, I could tell. And I, um, I actually broke into your hotel room, today. You'd have been very proud of me.",
        "Gus: Really?",
        "Harley: Mm-hmm.",
        "Gus: The blow-up doll is just for the carpool lane, I told you that, I...",
        "Harley: I know, I get that. You know, um... what you did today was...",
        "Gus: What I did today... it's what I do.",

        "Colin: What, did you think you were special?",
        "Reva: I was hoping. I'm not going to let go, Colin.",

        "Josh: Yeah, thank you for coming by. Uh, you said that... you said that Reva left you a message before she left town, right?",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Josh: What did she say, exactly? Did she talk about where she was going?",
        "Cassie: That she's working on a story for WSPR. She's in Minnesota, right? Isn't that what she told you?",
        "Josh: Yeah. That's what she told me, but that's not what she told Billy, see, and Billy knows more than either one of us, because he's been in touch with her.",
        "Cassie: And...?",
        "Josh: He said she went to visit a friend. The stories don't match.",
        "Cassie: So you think one of them's lying.",
        "Josh: Actually, I think both of them are lying. I don't know where Reva went, I don't know why she left, but I do know this. She's hiding something.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Reva: Joshua...",
        "Josh: You didn't really think you could hide from us much longer, did you, darling?",
        "Jonathan: We need you too much, Mom.",
        "Beth: Just go to our suite at the Beacon so your grandfather won't know what we're up to.",
