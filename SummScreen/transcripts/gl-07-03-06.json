        "Colin gets Reva to go to a cancer support meeting and she agrees only if he streaks naked down the hospital corridors. During the meeting, she opens up to some ladies and realizes she needs to get home to Josh. Afterwards, Reva makes Colin streak naked and he does it, but is mortified. He tells her later that her lab results look \"promising\". Tammy finds Alan's papers making Jonathan give up parental rights and tells Jonathan she doesn't want to live this way. Alan tells Coop that Lizzie made up the \"accident\" on the roof and Coop tells Lizzie goodbye. Lizzie is mad at Alan and at the Bauer's house, she tells him that she will prove to Coop that she is domestic and maternal. Alan, after trying to contact Jonathan on St. Gabriel, arranges for a jet to fly down and make Jonathan tow the line. Josh has a fight with Billy and tells him that he (Billy) may love Reva, but she will dump on Billy like she has dumped on him. He tells Billy and Cassie that Reva is now on her own."

        "Jonathan: Yo, Mom!",
        "Reva: Jonathan... Joshua?",
        "Josh: Hey, darling. You didn't really think you could hide from us much longer, did you?",
        "Jonathan: We need you too much, Mom.",
        "Cassie: Come home to us, Reva.",
        "Josh: Come home.",
        "Colin: Reva... Reva. Reva.",
        "Reva: Oh... Colin. They were here, my family, Joshua... they were all right here. So real.",
        "Colin: Looks like it's time to start facing reality, Reva.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Reva tells me she's gone off to cover a story. Billy tells me she's gone to visit a friend. (Knock at door)",
        "Alan: Josh, you passed right by me in the lobby without saying one word.",
        "Josh: What do you want, Alan?",
        "Alan: I was just wondering if Reva had heard... anything from Jonathan in the past few days?",
        "Josh: Why do you ask?",
        "Alan: Well, like it or not, our families are connected by the fact that Jonathan has fathered Elizabeth's baby.",
        "Josh: You know, here's an interesting idea. Why don't we let Jonathan and Lizzie work through this on their own?",
        "Alan: I think it's a little late for that. Because that boy damages everything and everyone he comes in contact with. And I'll be damned if I'm going to stand by an allow him to destroy the newest member of my family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Lizzie. Just go to our suite at the Beacon so your grandfather won't know what we're up to. Coop, Coop. I'm so sorry to bother you, it's... it's about Lizzie.",
        "Coop: Again? What now?",
        "Beth: No, Coop... she tried to hurt herself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Jonathan...",
        "Jonathan: We'll talk later, I promise...",
        "Tammy: No, I need to talk now. I'm sorry. It's my problem. I missed you so much. And I want you so much, but I want answers, too. This house...",
        "Jonathan: The house is ours. And while we're here, right now is all there is. Outside, nothing else exists.",
        "Tammy: Even your baby? Is that why you're here, you're pretending the baby isn't coming?",
        "Jonathan: No. I'm here for you. That's it. And that's more than enough for me. We can stay here for the rest of our lives.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: I shouldn't even be here. Lizzie is not your problem, you're not even together anymore.",
        "Coop: No, we're not together, Beth, but... what happened? Would you just... tell me what's going on.",
        "Beth: She, uh... she climbed out onto the roof at the hospital, and she was teetering on the edge... I can't stand to think about it.",
        "Coop: Okay.",
        "Beth: Thank God for Gus, that's all I can say, because he's the one that talked her down. And she's fine. The baby is fine. But I'm just, I'm so scared for her. Thank you. That's why I'm here.",
        "Coop: Well, where is she now?",
        "Beth: She's at our suite at the Beacon, but she won't let me in. She won't talk to me. She thinks that we're going to send her away again, I just... I don't know what to do.",
        "Coop: Okay, all right, relax. I'm glad that you told me...",
        "Beth: You know what? What am I doing, what am I doing? I'm sorry, Ava. I came in here to ask for your help, but I can't... it's not your problem. I'm sorry. I'm sorry to interrupt.",
        "Coop: (Sighs) Damn it, you know, when is this stuff going to end? Ava, when is it just going to be you and me and...",
        "Ava: I don't know. But it'll happen. I'll cover for you. Go, go.",
        "Coop: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I know that we've talked about moving away from Springfield, but are you sure... this is where you want to live for the rest of our lives?",
        "Jonathan: It's just... look at it! Look, come here. Look, just come here. Oh, oh, wow. (Laughs) Come here! Look at it, look, look. Just calm down for a second, and really... (inhales) Take it in. I mean... even just that breeze. And I've never really cared much for flowers, but... that smell? And... the quiet. All the quiet. And it's ours. And we'd be away from the crap for the first time since we've been together.",
        "Tammy: What's that? There in the water, the shadows?",
        "Jonathan: Oh, are you referring to the dolphins?",
        "Tammy: Dolphins?!",
        "Jonathan: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I had to pay them to come by at exactly this moment. Those suckers drive a hard bargain.",
        "Tammy: I want to see them! Come on!",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, you go, go. I'll be right behind you. And I heard if you feed them, they come right up to you. So, go.",
        "Tammy: Okay. I'll meet you.",
        "Jonathan: (Laughs)",
        "Tammy: Love you!",
        "Jonathan: Love you. (Sighs)",
        "Alan: All you have to do is sign that you relinquish all rights to Elizabeth's baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Back into doctor mode, are we. So what's the bad news?",
        "Colin: Bad news?",
        "Reva: That's why you're here, isn't it? You came to tell me...",
        "Colin: Oh, no, your test results aren't back. The lab hasn't finished yet.",
        "Reva: So we don't know yet whether the surgery was a success? Good. More waiting. So what's this reality I have to face?",
        "Colin: I stopped by to see you a few times, check on you while you were sleeping. And every time, Reva, you were talking with various members of your family, telling them everything that you've been going through.",
        "Reva: I dream about them. It keeps me connected. It's comforting, it's a good thing.",
        "Colin: Well, anything that helps you keep your energy up is a good thing.",
        "Reva: Yeah, to avoid that last chance procedure.",
        "Colin: I never called it that.",
        "Reva: No, experimental stem cell research. That doesn't sound much better.",
        "Colin: One step at a time. You remember? Listen, at this stage of the illness, as things drag on, patients often encounter such symptoms as depression, fear... these things need to be addressed. They can get in the way of your recovery. Fortunately for you, I can help you.",
        "Reva: Really?",
        "Colin: Mm-hmm.",
        "Reva: How? Prozac?",
        "Colin: Better. Support group.",
        "Reva: Oh, no. No, please.",
        "Colin: Coward.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Come on, Reva, call me. You promised you were going to call me back. (Cell phone rings)",
        "Billy: Reva?",
        "Jonathan: No, I'm looking for her too.",
        "Billy: Where are you, boy?",
        "Jonathan: Away, just sorting some stuff out.",
        "Billy: Like mother, like son.",
        "Jonathan: Where is she?",
        "Billy: She's having a surgery up in a hospital in Minnesota. Um... doctor wanted to do it as soon as possible. The chemo wasn't working.",
        "Jonathan: What kind of surgery?",
        "Billy: Lymph nodes. Your mom and I had a conversation before she left, and she's... she's kind of worried about you.",
        "Jonathan: Me?",
        "Billy: Yeah, you and that new baby of yours. Now, um, between you and me, I think that's the single biggest reason she has for going on. Oh, hold on a second. I have to take this call. Um, Jonathan, look. Don't screw this up. You make this happen. Your mom really needs something to believe. I mean, she really does. Yeah.",
        "Josh: You got here quick.",
        "Billy: Well, I was just down the hall, and the phone's still with me. You sound serious.",
        "Josh: Yeah, I need you to, uh... I need you to get a message to Reva for me.",
        "Billy: Okay.",
        "Josh: Alan Spaulding was here a little ago.",
        "Billy: Oh, he was?",
        "Josh: We talked about Jonathan, we talked about Lizzie's baby.",
        "Billy: Sounds like trouble.",
        "Josh: Maybe so. I just think Reva should know.",
        "Billy: Well, I... I think she's staying on top of this.",
        "Josh: (Clears throat) You mean while she's visiting her friend in Minnesota? Any other lies you want to share with me, Billy?",
        "Billy: Josh... just let it go, okay?",
        "Josh: Is that the best you've got, really? I call you a liar, and you just... say let it go? I mean... there must be something wrong here, because the brother I grew up with? He would beat the hell out of any man who called him a liar to his face.",
        "Billy: Okay, Josh, you want to go at it? Is that it? You want to lighten up here or you want to get...?",
        "Josh: (Laughs)",
        "Billy: Let's go, come on. I'll slap you around.",
        "Josh: I don't really want to fight you, Billy. I just want to know what the hell is going on in my marriage.",
        "Billy: Josh, you... (sighs) I don't want to hurt you, and I know Reva doesn't want to hurt you, and you're just going to have to have faith that what she's doing is right for her right now. Just... believe in Reva for right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Okay. I'll go to this... club cancer... but you're going to have to take off all your clothes... and streak up and down these hallways... flapping your arms like a mad hen. Well?",
        "Colin: Well, if that's what you decide.",
        "Reva: What makes you think I haven't already made my decision? (Snaps) Bring the car around, Colin.",
        "Colin: Colin. Interesting. Interesting, not so formal again. (Knock at door)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: It's open.",
        "Coop: Hey.",
        "Lizzie: Hey! What are you... doing here?",
        "Coop: I saw your mom. And she told me what happened.",
        "Lizzie: I'm surprised you believed her.",
        "Coop: I made a few calls.",
        "Lizzie: Look, I feel awful about it, okay? But... I didn't have a choice. I've been really lonely. It's not easy to go through a pregnancy alone.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, you're not alone. You've got your mom, and you've got your granddad, and...",
        "Lizzie: And I miss other people. Like you.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, Lizzie, you promised me that you were going to take care of yourself and also the baby.",
        "Lizzie: I know, I will. I swear. I know how much she means to you, Coop, and she is going to know how important you are to me.",
        "Coop: Lizzie...",
        "Alan: Well, Henry. I thought you might be headed this way. I assume that Elizabeth's told you about her ordeal on the hospital roof?",
        "Coop: Yeah. That must have been pretty scary for you.",
        "Alan: Yes, it was. That is until we found out the truth.",
        "Coop: The truth?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, you should go. Coop, thank you for visiting me. You should go.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, you did tell him... the real story? Elizabeth's ordeal was all an act. She did it for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Six dolphins! That's like something out of a movie! I just kept thinking it couldn't even really be happening.",
        "Jonathan: But it is.",
        "Tammy: And of course we would be happy here, I mean, who wouldn't? It just doesn't even seem... real.",
        "Jonathan: No? How about this? You and me. That's all. That's all that matters.",
        "Tammy: What's that? Does this place belong to Alan Spaulding?",
        "Jonathan: No, it's ours, I told you, just leave it!",
        "Tammy: Jonathan... oh, my God. You signed a contract with Alan giving up your rights to the baby?",
        "Jonathan: For us.",
        "Tammy: No. I won't let you do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ricky Paul Golden, \"Inside The Light.\" Shhh! Yeah, he's got a pill problem, so? Well, it's interesting that he's an addict at the moment, because... you know, he's more of a hero with an edge. And this takes the edge off. I think it's important, though, for the story to be told, because we are in a society right now where everything's a pill. A purple pill to feel better. Walking through wheat fields, going like this. You know? And I'm serious, it's on television every day. And I think, I hope, that something like this and maybe the way that we unfold the story will help people realize, you know, it's good to really feel things. See Gus Wednesday, July 5, \"Inside The Light.\"",

        "Reva: Colin...",
        "Colin: It's too late to change your mind. Come on.",
        "Reva: I haven't.",
        "Colin: You're more frightened of this than you were driving around a racetrack at 180 miles an hour.",
        "Reva: It's just, the more people I share this with, the more real and scarier it gets, so just... take me back, or I swear...",
        "Linda: Hey girls, look who's here!",
        "Jen: All right, fresh blood.",
        "Colin: Ladies, this is Reva. Take good care of her.",
        "Linda: Reva, huh? Well, join the club. We'd say join us for lunch, but we're not eating. Sadie's not up to it.",
        "Reva: I understand. Wish I didn't.",
        "Jen: We'll play cards instead. The waitresses don't mind.",
        "Linda: Yeah, they don't mind if we leave a big tip. Jen, will you put that ridiculous thing away?",
        "Jen: Sorry, some of us aren't retired, Lin. I work for...",
        "Linda and Jen: Retrograde Records.",
        "Linda: Don't worry, we've never heard of it either.",
        "Reva: So... how does this work?",
        "Linda: How does what work?",
        "Reva: Uh, well, this. This is my first time, I've never... been in a support group.",
        "Linda: Oooh, a virgin! (Laughs) Well, you'll pick it up right away. We do whatever we want. Say and do anything we want. That's pretty much it. Um, you dealing?",
        "Reva: What? Sorry?",
        "Linda: I'm asking if you're dealing.",
        "Reva: Uh, yeah, I guess. I'm trying.",
        "Jen: Reva, she...",
        "Reva: I mean, it's not easy. I don't have to tell you that...",
        "Linda: Uh, Reva...",
        "Reva: I mean I do my best. I have good days and then I have bad days...",
        "Jen: Reva, she means the cards.",
        "Linda: (Laughs)",
        "Reva: I'm in! (Laughs)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: You know what, Billy? I have a life to live. A life that needs to go on with or without Reva. Right now, I'm working on one of the most important things I've ever done. I have no one to share it with, no one to celebrate with. I want Reva by my side! I know she's struggling with something right now. I get that. But I don't know what it is! You know what it is! And you would think after all these years that we've spent together, she and I... that she would know that she could come to me and she could tell me anything!",
        "Billy: Josh, she must have her reasons.",
        "Josh: Then what are they?! Billy, I can't help but think to myself that if you had stayed out of this, she might have turned to me!",
        "Billy: (Sighs) Josh, this is not my call. It isn't. I'm not running the show. I'm not driving the car. I have no control over anything. Reva's doing this exactly the way Reva wants to... whether I think it's right or wrong. I'm not going to lie to you. I like being there for Reva, I do. But Reva's never been easy.",
        "Josh: Do you realize how crazy this sounds? You're saying that like Reva... has forced you into this. She's dragged you into this situation of hers, when here I am, wanting to be a part of it, wanting to jump in with both feet.",
        "Billy: Yeah, well, I... I really didn't have a choice. And you are right, she... she didn't choose you, she did choose me this time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Do not believe anything that he says!",
        "Coop: You lied to me about being up on the roof?",
        "Alan: No, no, no. She was on the roof. That part is true. But she almost fell, which she didn't plan. She thought she was going to be up there safe, and you would come and rescue her. But she almost had an accident. And I hope she's learned a lesson.",
        "Coop: Are you out of your mind?!",
        "Lizzie: Oh, Coop...",
        "Coop: Lizzie, that... that is sick. That is sick, using your baby!",
        "Alan: She was desperate to get you back, Henry. She felt that if she...",
        "Coop: I don't care what she felt! I don't care. I'm done caring, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, so what, that's it? You're just going to abandon Jenna?!",
        "Coop: No. She is not my daughter, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: But she could be! She wants to be, I know it!",
        "Coop: No! You know what? It's over. This is it. I'm done, Lizzie. Goodbye.",
        "Lizzie: No! Coop, no! Don't leave!",
        "Alan: Elizabeth. Elizabeth, come back. It's better this way.",
        "Lizzie: Things were better until you showed up. We finally had a chance to work things out, but you ruined it, just like you always do! Just like you ruin everything! How could you do this to me?",
        "Alan: How could you do this to your baby?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: In exchange for the above referenced property and monthly stipend, the undersigned hereby agrees to relinquish parental rights in perpetuity.",
        "Jonathan: Blah, blah, blah. I made sure Reva'd have her rights, and that takes care of that.",
        "Tammy: And you really think Alan can't get past that silly scribbling in court?",
        "Jonathan: No, what I really think is that this baby is going to be a lot better off without me. And look, I'm signing away something that I was going to give away anyway, except now we're getting something for it. A life together, Tammy... a beautiful life, with dolphins and flowers and no hassles, ever again. I mean, at home in Springfield, it's just about everyone judging. Is that what you want for us?",
        "Tammy: You know it isn't. I always thought we'd be sharing a baby together. I can handle that. As long as I'm with you, we can handle anything. Down the road, we'll... have our baby, too. But if you give up that child to be raised by the Spaulding's, you'll regret it, I know you.",
        "Jonathan: If I was giving something up I would feel it. But this is not a sacrifice to me. It's not. (Cell phone rings)",
        "Tammy: Later on, you don't know.",
        "Jonathan: Later on is later on. No one knows. Yeah.",
        "Coop: Where the hell are you?",
        "Jonathan: Coop? What do you want? Why don't you go earn a merit badge or something, huh?",
        "Coop: Do you even care what's going on right now?",
        "Jonathan: What? What's going on with the baby? What happened? Lizzie was in the hospital?",
        "Coop: No, dude, she was on the hospital. All right? She was pretending that she was jumping, except something went wrong, and she almost fell.",
        "Jonathan: Is the baby okay?",
        "Coop: Yeah, they're both fine.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, good. Well, then, why are you bothering me? It's not my problem. Lizzie wanted to get your attention, it worked. You're a fool. It's not my problem.",
        "Coop: This is your baby, all right? So it's time for you to step up. You know what? I'm out of this. And that baby does not deserve to suffer.",
        "Jonathan: Back off, boy wonder. I don't want to be anybody's damn father, okay?",
        "Coop: How about this? How about you just be a man? (Sighs) Hey...",
        "Ava: Hey... why did you do that?",
        "Coop: Because that little girl deserves to grow up with her real father being around. And... because... taking care of her cannot be the focus of my life anymore. Starting right now, it's you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I can't believe it.",
        "Jonathan: I can. She ought to be locked up, putting the baby in danger like that. Stupid. What?",
        "Tammy: You just keep proving it over and over again. You can't help caring about that baby.",
        "Jonathan: I care about you. That's it.",
        "Tammy: That's a lie, Jonathan. I was there, I heard the heartbeat. You saw a sonogram. You could see your daughter. And no one who cares about kids as much as you do could just walk away. Jonathan, I don't want you to resent me for coming between you...",
        "Jonathan: I won't, I won't. I won't let that happen, Tammy. You're what I want.",
        "Tammy: You've got me, Jonathan. Baby or no baby. But... why make a deal with the devil? Why... live on an island, away from the rest of our families and home? Choice, Jonathan? Home? Why do that when you have a choice, Jonathan? You have a choice. You can choose your baby.",

        "Alan: Elizabeth, what are you doing? Would you stop, please?",
        "Lizzie: I am getting Coop back. I'm taking control of my life. No more whining, that didn't work. I am going to show him how domestic and maternal I can be. Look at this! It is a homemade pie for the Bauer barbeque. I'm a regular Michelle Bauer.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, listen to me. He is not coming back. It is over.",
        "Lizzie: Don't say that!",
        "Alan: Sweetheart, he told you in his own words that he doesn't love you anymore.",
        "Lizzie: No!",
        "Alan: Now, you have got to grow up and move on. Please. Stop holding onto this fantasy about a working class guy swooping down and saving you. You don't need to be saved, sweetheart. You are a Spaulding. You need to think about the future, the future of the baby, before it is too late.",

        "Sadie: Me, too.",
        "Jen: Pair of jacks. You win, right, Reva? Reva...?",
        "Reva: I didn't want to be here today. I didn't want to be one of you, or... think of myself that way.",
        "Jen: Which way?",
        "Reva: As... I don't know, I just, I thought that, you know, I... I was above it all, you know? Stronger, better. Talk about having your head up your wig. (Laughs) I mean, you guys are...",
        "Linda: Go on, deal.",
        "Jen: No, let her finish.",
        "Reva: You know, I... I've worked really hard to try to do this on my own. You know, I pushed everybody else away. I was tough, and I was independent, and I was lonely. I didn't know how much I needed this. So far away from home with only Colin as company.",
        "Linda: (Laughs) Been there.",
        "Jen: That bedside manner. (Laughs) You've got to get up just so you can get out. (All laugh)",
        "Sadie: I think he's hot. (More laughter)",
        "Reva: Anyway. Thank you, thank you.",
        "Linda: For what?",
        "Reva: For making room for me. For making me see how hard I have to fight so that I can get well and get back home to my Joshua.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Reva and I just found each other again, but she chose you.",
        "Billy: You know what your problem is here, little brother? That you are in such a hurry to get this whole thing sewn up, between you and Reva and you and your project, that you are not realizing that... your needs aren't everybody else's needs. And what Reva needs right now is to take things day by day. That's what she needs, and that's what she wants. That's what she wants from me. And that's what I'm going to do.",
        "Josh: Well. Good luck with that, Billy. Let me give you a piece of advice, though. Brother, don't get too comfortable, okay? Because one day this phase for her will be over... and she'll dump on you the same way she's dumped on me. There's nothing you can do about it. And believe me when I say this, you won't see it coming. So, you make sure you get back to me when that happens, okay? And we'll talk about it. After you've figured out that you love her more than life itself. And that no matter how hard you try and no matter how long you try, you won't be able to get inside of her head, because she won't let you do that. (Door closes)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: You know, Colin, thank you for, um... taking me to the group. It did help.",
        "Colin: Oh, my God. Has... has time stopped? Is this, is the earth still revolving around the sun?",
        "Reva: Just like you left it, o mighty one.",
        "Colin: Wait, so you're actually admitting that your doctor knows what might be best for his patient.",
        "Reva: I'll admit that as soon as you live up to your end of the bargain. Because I believe a deal is a deal. Drop 'em.",
        "Colin: Right now? Reva, you're tired.",
        "Reva: No, it'll perk me right up. Come on, you said you would.",
        "Colin: Well, I can't, everyone knows me here.",
        "Reva: Well, you can wear a mask, unless there's a couple of nurses around who might recognize a mole or two.",
        "Colin: No.",
        "Reva: (Laughs) I didn't think so. (Giggles)",
        "Colin: Reva, I can't!",
        "Reva: (Fake accent) Take it off. Take it all off. Go on. Now, go. Go... now. Hurry up! I'll just be here... (laughs) ..Picturing the beauty of it all.",
        "Colin: (Clears his throat)",
        "Reva: (Whistles) You can leave your socks on.",
        "Colin: Oh, great.",
        "Reva: Take your time.",
        "Colin: How about just...",
        "Reva: Every day is a new reason to live. Go on now.",
        "Colin: Very awkward.",
        "Reva: Don't be afraid. Go.",
        "Colin: I feel very, I don't...",
        "Reva: Run. On your mark, get set, go! Go! Go, go, go! Dr. McCabe's in the hallway! Come on out, people! (Laughs) You're just disappointed you didn't get more attention.",
        "Colin: You're crazy.",
        "Reva: And you've got great buns. (Laughs) I'm crazy in a good way.",
        "Colin: Hey, Kevin! Wait, just a second.",
        "Reva: Colin.",
        "Colin: No, he works in the lab, he might have your results.",
        "Reva: Colin... are those the... the results?",
        "Colin: Yeah.",
        "Reva: Well, what does it say? Colin?",
        "Colin: What does it say... it says that, uh... things look promising. Very promising.",

They want interviews, photos. They want an interview with you on site in Tulsa. I told them, sounds good, let me just check his schedule. Hey. Hey, you.",
        "Josh: I have a phone number for Reva.",
        "Cassie: And you haven't called her yet? What are you waiting for? Call her! Find the woman, call her!",
        "Josh: No, I don't think so. I, um... I think I'm done chasing her. Besides, she would just blow me off anyway, right? And I have so much stuff to do here.",
        "Cassie: What are you talk...",
        "Josh: That I can't track her down someplace God knows where and grab her and throw her over my shoulder and bring her home against her will.",
        "Cassie: Josh. Call her.",
        "Josh: No. No. I can't do that anymore. Reva's on her own.",

        "Ava: Really?",
        "Coop: Yeah, is that okay?",
        "Ava: I just don't know if we're going to know how to handle that, Coop, right? I mean, no complications? Nobody standing in our way, nothing holding us back at all?",

No one can guilt me... I don't want to be there. You've got to get that. Reva does, too. It's my call, it's my choice. This is my way out. It's my freedom. It's our future. Look, signing away all my rights to this baby... is the best thing for everyone. Most of all for her.",

        "Jonathan: Fine... fine, we'll go back. I don't care. You're right. I mean... baby or no baby, I shouldn't let someone tell me what to do. Especially I'm not going to let Alan Spaulding chase me out of town. (Cell phone rings) Speaking of the devil...",
