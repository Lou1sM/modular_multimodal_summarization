        "Reva: Jonathan? Jonathan? Hey. ( Music stops\r\n) Hey! ",
        "Jonathan: Hey! Happy Fourth of July. ",
        "Reva: What do you think you're doing? ",
        "Jonathan: Blowing off some steam. What's it\r\nlook like? ",
        "Reva: It's looks like you're destroying my\r\nhouse. What's gotten into you? ",
        "Jonathan: I was thinking about Moms, and how\r\nsome of them are better off dead. ",
        "",
        "Rick: The Bauer forecast looks to be 99%\r\nchance of showers. Great. ",
        "Mel: You don't want to cancel, do you? ",
        "Rick: Oh, no, not on your life. This is a\r\nperfect day for a barbecue: My dad's not here, Michelle\u2019s not here, my best\r\nfriend's dead. ",
        "Mel: Oh, honey, you're missing your wingman\r\nfor the barbecue. ",
        "Rick: Well, you know what? You can be my\r\nwingman. I'll tell you what. You hold the umbrella. ",
        "Mel: How about I loan you my raincoat instead?\r\n",
        "Rick: I'll tell you what. You throw in the\r\ngaloshes, you've got yourself a deal. ( Laughter ) ",
        "Mel: This can't be the first time it's\r\nrained at a Bauer barbecue. ",
        "Rick: Usually there's so much chaos around\r\nhere, you don't even notice the weather. ",
        "Danny: Hey. ",
        "Mel and Rick: Hey. ",
        "Danny: Are we going to get rained out today\r\nor what? ",
        "Rick: No. ",
        "Mel: I know. ",
        "Rick: You're not going to melt with the\r\nrain, so we're going to have a barbecue. ",
        "Danny: Have you guys heard from Michelle? ",
        "Rick: I don't know. Did she get on the\r\nplane? I mean, I have no idea. ",
        "Danny: Well, it would be nice if she gave us\r\na heads up, don't you think? ",
        "Mel: I think she's just trying to give you\r\nand Marina your space. ",
        "Danny: Still, it's her house, her family's\r\nparty. ",
        "Rick: Michelle's trying to let you get on\r\nwith your life, Danny. ",
        "Danny: Well, I am, but Michelle and Robbie\r\nbelong here. ",
        "",
        "Buzz: Zach? Zach, where are the chips? ",
        "Zach: I ate them. ",
        "Buzz: What? You ate them? You ate all of\r\nthem? ",
        "Zach: I was hungry. ",
        "Buzz: Yeah, that would be hungry. ",
        "Zach: Mommy used to give me these chips. ",
        "Buzz: Yeah. Yeah. Will you do me a favor? Do\r\nyour old grandpa a favor? I think we got some more in the back. Can you go in\r\nthe kitchen and get me some more chips? ",
        "Alexandra: Well, I thought Fourth of July\r\nwas supposed to be a happy holiday. ",
        "Buzz: Well, it's a rainy day, and Zach\r\nmisses his mom. ",
        "Alexandra: I'm sure she misses them too. ",

        "Mallet: Cooper, huh? Okay. Thanks. ",
        "Harley: What? What is it? Cooper? Cooper, what?\r\nWhat? ",
        "Mallet: Frank was here. He took Gus back to Springfield. ",
        "Harley: Frank? ",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I guess that explains why the\r\ncops weren't waiting for us when we got back here. ",
        "Harley: No, no, no. Frank would never let me\r\nget away; not if he had the chance. ",
        "Mallet: What are you talking about? He's\r\nyour brother. He doesn't want to see you hurt. ",
        "Harley: Yeah, which is why he would stick\r\naround to turn me in. No, it was Gus. Gus threw him off our trail. Don't you\r\nget it? ",
        "Mallet: Thanks, Gus. ",
        "Harley: No, not \"Thanks, Gus.\" I'm\r\nnot going to let him take the fall for me. ",
        "Mallet: Well, there's not much you can do\r\nabout it now. ",
        "Harley: I can turn myself in. ",
        "Mallet: Oh... what will that accomplish? ",
        "Harley: Could you just unlock me, please? ",
        "Mallet: No. No. Today is about you and it's\r\nabout your freedom. We are here to find Phillip\u2019s killer, and that's exactly\r\nwhat we're going to do. ",
        "Harley: We have reached a dead end here. Come\r\non. Wallace is dead. Sebastian has disappeared. ",
        "Mallet: Yeah, so we just got to keep\r\nlooking. ",
        "Harley: Looking where, Mallet? Where? Where?\r\nWhere? Andrea Wallace is his only living relative, and she doesn't know\r\nanything. ",
        "Mallet: We have to think about it. Come on, Cooper,\r\nthink. Have you forgotten everything I've taught you? ",
        "Harley: I... I am going out there, and I am\r\ngoing to find Gus even if it means dragging you with me! How much do you weigh?\r\n",
        "Mallet: More than you. Now would you please\r\njust give me a chance to help you? ",
        "Harley: No. Thank you for trying. Thank you.\r\nBut you've done everything you could. There's nothing more you can do. There is\r\nnothing anybody can do. ",
        "Mallet: Now, I know you are tired of this\r\nwhole damn mess. I'm not exactly loving it myself, okay? But you've got to\r\nstick it out. ",
        "Harley: Stick it out? What? There's nothing\r\nmore to learn. ",
        "Mallet: What are you talking about? Nothing\r\nto learn? What was Wallace being paid to cover up? ",
        "Harley: I don't know! ",
        "Mallet: Well, there you go. ( Thumping ) Would\r\nyou, please, please... would you stop that? ",
        "Harley: I need to find Gus. Ow! ",
        "Mallet: You are not going to go see Gus. And\r\nyou are going to sit down, and for God's sakes, would you please just stop\r\ntalking for a minute? Here. ",
        "Harley: You're not the warden anymore. You\r\ndon't get to tell me what to do, okay? ",
        "Mallet: You didn't listen to me when I was. ",
        "Harley: Well, I'm certainly not going to\r\nstart now. ",
        "Mallet: That's fine. Then don\u2019t. But we're\r\nnot moving. Now, I need to rest. I need to do some thinking. ",
        "Harley: Gus has never deserted me, not once.\r\nI'm not going to desert him now. ",
        "Mallet: I'm sure he's going to be very\r\ngrateful when you both have adjoining cells. ",
        "Harley: You are so jealous. ",
        "Mallet: You are giving me a headache. ",
        "Harley: Good. ",
        "Mallet: Just let me think, okay? ",
        "Harley: Well, let me give you some room,\r\nbecause I don't want to get caught in the... ",
        "Mallet: You know, this isn't about you and Gus.\r\n",
        "Harley: What is it about, then? ",
        "Mallet: What? ",
        "Harley: This. If it's not about me and Gus,\r\nwhat is it about? ",
        "Mallet: It's about Frank, your boys, your\r\ndad. Don't you ever think about them? ",
        "Harley: You know I do. ",
        "Mallet: Well, don't you want to go home and\r\nbe able to stay there and not have to think about leaving them again? ",
        "Harley: I think you already know the answer\r\nto that question. ",
        "Mallet: Good. Then you know exactly what you\r\nhave to do right now. ",
        "Harley: But you don't understand. I can't\r\njust leave Gus out there. He has... he's never done that to me. He's been so\r\ngood to me through this whole thing. ",
        "Mallet: Oh, my God. You're going to make me\r\ndo this, aren't you? ",
        "Harley: What kind of person am I... ",
        "Mallet: What would Gus want you to do? ",
        "Harley: Well, I don't know. ",
        "Mallet: Would Gus want you to give yourself\r\nup right now? ",
        "Harley ( Softly ): No. ",
        "Mallet: I'm sorry. What? I didn't hear that.\r\n",
        "Harley: I said no. ",
        "Mallet: You said no. Then you have to figure\r\nthis out, Harley. Do you want me to unlock these cuffs right now so you can go\r\nrunning back to Gus, or what? ( Knock at door ) ",
        "",
        "Buzz: Zach, you know your mom would do\r\nanything to be with you right now. ",
        "Alexandra: Your grandpa's absolutely right, Zach.\r\n",
        "Buzz: But she can\u2019t. ",
        "Zach: I don't want to go if Mommy's not\r\nthere. ",
        "Buzz: But you've got to go. You won the\r\nPotato Sack Race last year. ",
        "Alexandra: Wow, the Potato Sack Race. I\r\nwonder who's going to win it this year, huh? ",
        "Zach: I hop faster than anybody. ",
        "Buzz: You're fast, but if you don't go... I\r\nmean, how are you going to win if you don't go? ",
        "Alexandra: Who will? Maybe I will, huh?\r\nSuppose I win? ",
        "Zach: In those shoes? ",
        "Buzz: You think you can take your Aunt Alex\r\non? ",
        "Zach: Okay. ",
        "Alexandra: ( Laughs ) ",
        "Buzz: Okay? Okay? ",
        "Alexandra: Is that a challenge, young man?\r\nYou whippersnapper. ( Knock at door ) ",
        "Buzz: We're closed. Closed. ",
        "Zach: Hi, Granddad. ",
        "Alan: Well... ",
        "Buzz: Alan. ",
        "Alan: Hello, Buzz. Happy fourth of July.\r\nHey, Zach. Where are you off to, buddy? ",
        "Buzz: Oh, gee, where do you think? Maybe the\r\nBauer\u2019s? We were just heading out the door. ",
        "Alan: Well, I won't keep you guys long. I just\r\nwanted to stop by and say \"Happy Holiday\" to you all. ",
        "Alexandra: Well, that's very good of you, Alan.\r\nWhy don't I show you out, hmm? ",
        "Alan: Bye, Zach. ",
        "Alexandra: You followed me, Alan. ",
        "Alan: Can you blame me? ",
        "Alexandra: Alan, you are out of control. ",
        "Alan: I told you to stay away from Buzz Cooper,\r\nand disobeying me is not a wise choice. ",
        "Alexandra: And you know what? I'm really\r\nsick and tired of your threats. Now I've kept your promise. Now I'm warning\r\nyou: You just back off. ",
        "Alan: Or what? ",
        "Alexandra: Or maybe you've forgotten about a\r\ncertain little videotape that names you as Phillip\u2019s killer. ",
        "Alan: That would not be a wise choice, Alexandra.\r\n",

        "Mel: Have you told Michelle how you feel? ",
        "Danny: No. ",
        "Mel: Maybe you should. You know, just put it\r\nall out there on the table. It's so sad when a marriage ends, especially when\r\nit doesn't have to. I'm so glad you're here, Danny. ",

        "",
        "Mel: Oh, my... Marina! I am so sorry. Oh, my gosh. Are you all right? ",

        "Mel: Let me get you an ice pack. ",
        "Marina: No, don't bother. I'll... I'll just use this. ",
        "Mel: Well, at least let me give you a couple\r\nof aspirin. Hold on. ",

        "Danny: Does Mel think I'm trying to get back\r\ntogether with Michelle? ",
        "Rick: It's just that my wife has a tough\r\ntime with change, Danny. You know, once she believes in something, she has a\r\nreal tough time giving it up. ",
        "Danny: Okay. Well, maybe I should say\r\nsomething to her. ",
        "Rick: No, no, no. Let me... let me burst her\r\nbubble, okay, and save you the speech? ",
        "Danny: You think I'd get a speech? ",
        "Rick: You have no idea. I mean, every time\r\nmy sister calls, it's the same speech over and over. \"You can work it out.\r\nBlah, blah, blah.\" She means well. She really does. ",

        "Reva: What? ",
