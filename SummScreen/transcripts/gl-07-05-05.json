        "Alexandra: Well, here you are. Looks like\r\nit's going to clear up, huh? ",
        "Buzz: Oh, I hope so. I'm getting tired of\r\nclouds. ",
        "Alexandra: Yes, I know. You miss your little\r\ngirl, don't you? Well, I'm going to make a prediction. ",
        "Buzz: Yeah. ",
        "Alexandra: But it must remain completely entre nous. ",
        "Buzz: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Alexandra: Harley will be here next year for\r\nthe barbecue. I can feel it. ",
        "Buzz: Is your loony tunes brother going to\r\nbe here? Because if he is, we're not going to need fireworks. ",
        "Alexandra: Oh, well, I don't think you have\r\nto worry about Alan. I have him under control. But until I know you have both\r\nfeet on the ground, I'm calling the shots. ",
        "Alan: If you betray me, you will regret it. ",
        "Alexandra: I swore I wouldn't, and I haven\u2019t.\r\nBut if anything... anything happens to anyone else, like I said, Alan, that\r\ntape is going to be released, and you'll find yourself smoking that last\r\nillegal Havana in the electric chair. ",
        "",
        "Danny: I missed you so much, Buddy. Look at\r\nhow big this guy is getting. Look at this. I bet your mommy can't even pick up\r\nanymore. Can she? Where is Mommy? ",
        "Rick: She didn't come. ",
        "Danny: What do you mean? ",
        "Rick: She just couldn't get away. One of my\r\ndad's nurses was flying home, so Michelle sent Robbie with her and just dropped\r\nhim off a couple of minutes ago, right, pal? We're going to have a good time\r\ntoday. ",
        "Danny: Yeah, we are. I've been dying to hear\r\nall about Africa. You're going to have to fill me in. Can you do\r\nthat? ",
        "Robbie: I'll tell you everything. ",
        "Danny: Good. Well, why don't we eat first?\r\nAre you hungry? Let's see what we got set up for you over here. Come on. Oh,\r\nlook at this. Why don't you sit here? ",
        "Buzz: You okay? ",
        "Marina: Yeah. ",
        "Buzz: Yeah? ",
        "Marina: Now I know. ",
        "Buzz: Now you know what? ",
        "Marina: I was telling Dad a little while ago that I\r\nwouldn't be sure if Danny was really over Michelle until I saw the two of them\r\ntogether again. ",
        "Buzz: Well, you haven't seen them.\r\nMichelle's not here. ",
        "Marina: No. But the look on Danny\u2019s face answered all my\r\nquestions. ",
        "Buzz: What look you talking about? ",
        "Marina: The one of total and complete disappointment. ",
        "",
        "Dinah: Oh, come on. ( Sighs ) Maybe I'm\r\neating for one, but that doesn't mean that I'm not... ",
        "Ross: Hungry? ",
        "Dinah: Hi, Daddy. ",
        "Ross: You know, Buzz always closes this\r\nplace every year on the Fourth of July, because he goes to the Bauer Barbecue. ",
        "Blake: We were sent on Olive Duty, because Buzz\r\nforgot to bring them. ",
        "Ross: Yeah. So you're not going to find a\r\nhamburger here today. So why don't you join us at the barbecue? ",
        "Dinah: Be seen with me in public? Well,\r\nthat'll be a holiday first. ",
        "Ross: Dinah, come on. It'll be good for you.\r\n",
        "Dinah: It would, really. I remember being\r\npregnant at the Bauer Barbecue. It's a lot of fun. You see all the kids running\r\naround, and you realize that next year there's going to be another one. ",
        "",
        "Bill: You sure you're up for this? ",
        "Olivia: Yeah. ",
        "Bill: Yeah. ",
        "Olivia: Yeah, I told you before. Marissa and\r\nI weren't really that close. ",
        "Bill: Come on. ",
        "Olivia: But, you know, when she went\r\nmissing, I just... you don't want to fear the worst, but then you get a phone\r\ncall, and, you know, she's gone. But I really think it's good for me to be here\r\nbecause I want to see Emma playing and laughing and enjoying herself. And I\r\nalso really want to be a family, you know, a real family with you. ",
        "Bill: Well, you got that, okay? ",
        "Olivia: And I want something else. ",
        "Bill: Hmm. ",
        "Olivia: I want to change her name, her last\r\nname, to Lewis. It just feels right, Bill, you know: Emma Lewis. ",
        "Bill: Yes. Yeah. ",
        "",
        "Reva: I really miss you, Joshua. So what\r\nhave the police said? Do they have any clues about her husband at all? Nothing.\r\nSweetie, I know. It's just that I'm frustrated, okay? Jonathan seems to think\r\nthat Alfred might have had something to do with Marissa\u2019s drowning, and now\r\nhe's trying to back off the idea. Yes, which is why I think it's more important\r\nthat we try to track the guy down. ",
        "Jonathan: I'm not going to that lame\r\nbarbecue with Reva. ",
        "Nate: Maybe I should be her date. ( Laughs )\r\n",
        "Jonathan: You'd be bored worse. Come on. How\r\nabout we go out to the bar, talk about how to strip the Lewis payroll clean out\r\nof the bank account? ",
        "Nate: You couldn't care less about the Lewis\r\npayroll. You just want me away from Mrs. Lewis. You think I killed Marissa, and\r\nnow you're worried I'm going to do the same thing to your real mom. ",
        "Jonathan: You've got some imagination. ",
        "Nate: Jonathan, I know what you're thinking.\r\nI always know what you're thinking. I can read it, right there. So let me\r\nschool you. I'm not here in Springfield to kill Reva. I'm here in Springfield to take what she's got. ",
        "Jonathan: That was the plan? ",
        "Nate: Yeah. You don't cook the goose that\r\nlays the golden eggs. There's no advantage to killing Reva, so it's not on the\r\nagenda at the moment. As for Marissa, shame on you for thinking I could\r\npossibly murder my own wife. What kind of man do you take me for? ",
        "Jonathan: You hit her hard enough to kill\r\nher sometimes. ",
        "Nate: Yeah, maybe. But I was forceful with\r\nyou as well, and you're still alive. ",
        "Jonathan: So far. ",
        "Nate: What did you just say? ",
        "Nate: What did you just say? ",
        "Jonathan: Nothing. ",
        "Nate: That's really rude, Jonathan,\r\nanswering under your breath. I don't care for that. ",
        "Jonathan: Sorry. ",
        "Nate: How many times do I have to say this?\r\nThere is a right way to behave, and there is a wrong way to behave. People have\r\nto understand that. I feel really bad about Marissa, but I had nothing to do\r\nwith her death? Got it? ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I got it. ",
        "Nate: So you're with me? You believe in what\r\nwe're doing? Say you're with me. ",
        "Jonathan: I'm with you. ",
        "Nate: And you're going to stop doubting me\r\nall the time. ",
        "Jonathan: I'll stop. ",
        "Nate: That wasn't very convincing. ",
        "Jonathan: I'll stop. ",
        "Nate: One more time. ",
        "Jonathan: I'll stop. ",
        "Nate: That's better. We're going to see this\r\nthrough to the end, you and me, together, right? Words, Jonathan. ",
        "Jonathan: Yes. ",
        "Nate: Yes? ",
        "Jonathan: Yes, we'll see it through\r\ntogether. ",
        "Nate: Or else what? Or else what? ",
        "Reva: Hey, what's going on? ",
        "",
        "Dinah: What did I say? Like summer, the\r\nbaby. My gosh. I mean, don't you see how cruel that sounds? ",
        "Ross: Blake only meant for you to look at\r\nthe big picture here. ",
        "Dinah: I just... I'm not going to have the\r\nbaby next summer, okay? I'm not going to have anything. And I appreciate you\r\nfor reminding me of that, Blake. ",
        "Blake: I'm sorry. Excuse me. ",
        "Ross: Dinah, you have known all along that\r\nyou were going to have to give up this child. ",
        "Dinah: I know that, Dad. I just... I thought\r\nthat... ",
        "Ross: You thought that when Cassie and Edmund\r\nbroke up that Edmund would turn to you because you're carrying his child. But\r\nthe reality is, Edmund did not turn to you. ",
        "Dinah: Daddy, nothing is working out the way\r\nI wanted it to. ",
        "Ross: Well, then let us help. You don't have\r\nto do this alone. Now, we put pressure on you the past few months, but that is\r\nnot the reason that Edmund rejected you, honey. ",
        "Dinah: Okay, it's not the reason why I\r\nlost... ",
        "Blake: Lost what? What did you lose? ",
        "Dinah: My faith in your support. Not that I\r\never had it to begin with. ",
        "Ross: Dinah, please. ",
        "Dinah: You know what? I said that I have\r\nnothing, but I'm wrong, because I'm going to get everything I want. I'm going\r\nto get everything. ",
        "Alan: Emma Lewis? My granddaughter's last\r\nname is Lewis, huh? ",
        "Olivia: It has a nice ring to it, don't you\r\nthink? ",
        "Alexandra: Bill. Olivia. I thought you two\r\nwere out of town. ",
        "Olivia: We were, but it wasn't a safe place\r\nto be. ",
        "Alexandra: It wasn't safe. ",
        "Alan: You know, I think you've forgotten\r\nthat Emma\u2019s last name is Spaulding. ",
        "Bill: Alan, your vote doesn't count. ",
        "Alan: Well, let's ask Emma. Emma,\r\nsweetheart... ",
        "Olivia: You can see her from where she is. ",
        "Rick: We having a great time? Great. Keep it\r\nhappy. ",
        "Olivia: Stay away from my daughter. ",
        "Bill: Olivia has every right to change Emma\u2019s\r\nname. ",
        "Olivia: The adoption went through. ",
        "Bill: That's right. ",
        "Alan: What? ",
        "Bill: It's legal. Bill is Emma\u2019s daddy,\r\ndespite the accident you created for him at Cross Creek. ",
        "Alan: What the hell are you talking about? ",
        "Alexandra: Alan! ",
        "Alan: Wait a minute. Let me get this\r\nstraight. So Emma\u2019s real father means nothing? He's just going to be forgotten?\r\nAre you out of your mind? Phillip would never have allowed this. Do you hear\r\nme? ",
        "Gus: They hear you in the next county. ",
        "Alan: Emma Lewis. Well, Emma Lewis, huh? ",
        "Olivia: Yeah. That's going to be her name.\r\nYou might as well get used to it. ",
        "Alan: Well, it doesn't just trickle off the\r\ntongue like Emma Spaulding. But if that little girl needs a new father and a\r\nnew last name, if that will make her happy, there's nothing else that's important,\r\nis it? ",
        "Alan: Rick, this all looks marvelous. ",
        "Bill: You can't be okay with this, Alan. ",
        "Rick: Bill, he's trying very hard not to be\r\nthe subhuman that he is. Just leave it alone. ",
        "Alan: Bill, you're asking me if I have\r\nissues with the choice your wife made. Of course I do. But you wouldn't want me\r\nto interrupt this gathering would you just because I disagree with you? ",
        "Bill: No. No, no. ",
        "Olivia: That would be so out of character\r\nfor you. ",
        "Alan: Come on, everyone. This is Fourth of July.\r\nThis is a wonderful celebration, and let's all enjoy ourselves. Rick, there\r\nmust be something that I can help you with. ",
        "Bill: Go play on the freeway. ",
        "Olivia: It's got to be the sedative. ",
        "Bill: You think? ",
        "Olivia: Hm. Alan, listen to me. I'm sorry,\r\nfirst of all. And I really appreciate you being so open-minded about this. You\r\nknow, I have to say, I mean, the look on your face when I told you about the\r\nadoption, you seemed like you were really taken aback. ",
        "Alan: You know something? I was. Because the\r\nlast time you and I discussed this, you said you were going to put the adoption\r\noff. ",
        "Olivia: I did no such thing. ",
        "Alan: You have selective memory. Now, if you\r\nwill excuse me. ",
        "Olivia: All right, this is weird, because I\r\nhonestly believed that he didn't know anything about the adoption. ",
        "Bill: Okay, well, then if this is the first\r\ntime he's heard about it... ",
        "Olivia: Then maybe he didn't set up the\r\naccident in Cross Creek. ",
        "Bill: Well, then maybe it was just that-- an\r\naccident. ",
        "Olivia: No. No way. ",
        "Alexandra: Alan, maybe you... maybe you\r\nshould... ",
        "Alan: Just leave me alone, Alexandra. I need\r\na drink. I need to get those two pretenders out of my sight. ",
        "Alexandra: ( Gasps ) ",
        "",
        "Reva: I said, what's going on? What are you\r\ndoing? What did he say to you? ",
        "Nate: Go ahead, Jonathan. Tell your mom what\r\nthis is all about. ",
        "Jonathan: We were talking about baseball. ",
        "Reva: Jonathan? Jonathan, wait. Jonathan?\r\nWell? ",
        "Nate: I love baseball. It's so American. All\r\nright, Reva, look. I owe you an apology. I shouldn't meddle in your family\r\naffairs. I do understand that. But I can't just stand by while that boy\r\nmanipulates you again. ",
        "Reva: Manipulate me? How? ",
        "Nate: I should leave. I've muddled things up\r\nenough already. ",
        "Reva: No, no, no. No. I'd like an\r\nexplanation. ",
        "Nate: ( Clears his throat ) Jonathan always\r\npulls you into his dramas, all right? That much is obvious, even from the\r\nrelatively little time that I've been around. But this time he's using his\r\nadoptive mother's death to play you. ",
        "Reva: His mother drowned. He has a right to\r\nbe hurt. ",
        "Nate: He's after more than sympathy, Reva.\r\nBelieve me, I know. ",
        "Reva: What is that supposed to mean? ",
        "Nate: He's always trying to twist you into a\r\nknot of guilt, every chance he can get, forever. And he always will do, unless\r\nsomeone stops him. ",
        "Reva: So you're such an expert on my son. ",
        "Nate: I'm just telling you as a friend.\r\nDon't let him get away with it, for your own sake. ",
        "",
        "Marina: The zebra went backwards? ",
        "Robbie: Like this. ",
        "Danny: Come on, show us. Oh, no. ( Laughter\r\n) That's great. What a good story, Bud. That's excellent. ",
        "Robbie: Where's the\r\nfireworks, Daddy? ",
        "Danny: Well, the fireworks are going to be\r\nlater. It has to get dark out. You remember that. ",
        "Marina: I bet you're glad that you made it back in time for\r\nthem, huh I bet you wish that your mom could have been here, too. ",
        "Danny: Well, we all wish that she could be\r\nhere, right? So what do you feel like eating, if you don't want to eat your\r\nsandwich? ",
        "Robbie: Fries, ice cream, cookie, candy. ",
        "Danny: Oh, I see. Oh, cake and candy. ",
        "Marina: Oh, boy. ",
        "Danny: Okay. ",
        "Marina: Does your mom let you eat all that kind of stuff? I\r\nmean, we wouldn't want to break any rules. ",
        "Danny: Well, it's a holiday. It's okay to\r\nbreak the rules today. Right, Buddy? So... ",
        "Rick: Are you guys... are you guys going to\r\njoin the party or what? I mean, there's plenty of sunshine to go around out\r\nthere. ",
        "Danny: Yeah, of course. Hey, why don't ask Uncle\r\nRick where the candy stash is? ",
        "Rick: I ate all the candy. ",
        "Danny: What? ",
        "Rick: I'm sorry. Do you still love me? Come\r\non, buddy, let's go outside. We've got some more candy out there. Come on. ",
        "Danny: Hey. Hey. You know, if you want to\r\nknow how I feel about Michelle not being here, you can just ask me. ",
        "Marina: Yeah. Subtlety is not my thing. ",
        "Danny: No, not really. The truth is, I'm\r\nupset that she stayed in Africa. I can't even begin to tell you how much I wanted\r\nher to be here. ",

        "Jonathan: Hey. It's me, babe. Sorry to\r\ndisappoint you. ",

        "Jonathan: Hoping for a prince? That's cool.\r\nI'm used to wrecking people's dreams. ",
        "Dinah: What do you want? ",
        "Jonathan: Angelina Jolie. No wait. Lindsay Lohan.\r\nNo wait. Angelina Jolie and Lindsay Lohan. ",
        "Dinah: Oh, okay. Good luck. ",
        "Jonathan: Wait. Wait. I went out for a walk,\r\nand I ended up here. So I thought I'd come up and ask. ",
        "Dinah: Ask what? ",
        "Jonathan: When you came to town, you had one\r\npurpose, right? To ruin Cassie. And you hit like the Mega-Jackpot, you know,\r\nrevenge. You ruined her marriage. ",
        "Dinah: So? ",
        "Jonathan: Well, I'm just like wondering\r\nabout this revenge thing. I mean, when is enough enough? ",
        "",
        "Bill: So if Alan didn't rig the non-accident\r\naccident at Cross Creek, who did? ",
        "Olivia: Well, maybe he was lying. ",
        "Bill: I don't think so. All right, look, I\r\ndon't want to sound naive here, but do you think it's possible that Alan\r\nrealized that he can't fight us on the adoption, so he's actually putting Emma\r\nfirst? ",
        "",
        "Buzz: Oh, Ross, I forgot to mention, I read\r\nyour guest editorial in the paper, and... ",
        "Alexandra: I read it too, actually. It was\r\nquite good. ",
        "Buzz: It was great. ",
        "Ross: Thank you. ",
        "Buzz: My favorite line went \"Our\r\nheaviest responsibility may well be not to take our freedom lightly.\" ",
        "Ross: Very good. ",
        "Alan: Freedom. Freedom. Right. ",
        "Ross: I'm sorry, Alan. Did you say\r\nsomething? ",
        "Alexandra: Well, I think he said he was\r\ngoing back inside. ",
        "Alan: No, the subject that Ross was talking\r\nabout was freedom and some people who abuse it. Now, a jury returns a guilty\r\nverdict, a sentence is given, and yet, if you free yourself from prison, you\r\ncan go around the country on a quest to prove your innocence and become a folk\r\nhero. ",
        "Buzz: You really should go inside. ",
        "Alan: And justice. Would anyone like to hear\r\nabout justice? ",
        "Alexandra: Alan, please. ",
        "Alan: These two waltz in here announcing\r\nthat Phillip is no longer Emma\u2019s father because of some court paper. Harley Cooper,\r\na convicted murderer, is traveling around the country. You want her here to\r\nhelp you stir up the potato salad. ",
        "Buzz: Enough, Alan. ",
        "Alan: No. No, no, no. Today is Independence\r\nDay, Buzz. And I think it's my patriotic duty to announce the truth. And the\r\ntruth is you're all hypocrites, because the truth of the matter is, Harley Cooper\r\nshould be in prison, where she belongs. ",

        "Alan: Congratulations, Buzz. ",
        "Rick: I think some seltzer water will take\r\nthat right out, Alan. You might want to go clean up. A beautiful left hook. ",

        "Rick: I don't know. Listen, Buzz, I don't\r\nwant to see Marina get hurt any more than you do. In fact I've been encouraging\r\nDanny to move on with his life. But Danny and Michelle are... ",
