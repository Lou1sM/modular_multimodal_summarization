        "Gus explains to his rehab group that Harley doesn't trust him and he doesn't trust himself. Buzz helps Gus build the house. Harley wafts back and forth about Gus building the house without a contractor. Mallet and Dinah pitch in to help build the house as well. Mallet tells Gus that if he lets him help and they do a decent job together, maybe they can be partners again. Rick, who mistrusts Gus, has Mel draw up a custody amendment and gives to Harley, who refuses it and tells him to get out of her house. Later in the night, Frank, Coop, Mallet, Dinah all pitch in to help build the house. Rick comes back and Buzz tells Harley that Rick might be reconsidering what he said about not wanting Jude to stay with Harley and Gus.

    "Transcript": [
        "Gus: So I recently ran into my own wife. My own wife. How screwed up does that sound, \"I ran into my own wife?\" But there was good news and there was bad news. The good news is that she still loves me. And the bad news is that she doesn't trust me. And I can't really say that I blame her, because I lied to her. I lied to myself, and um... I don't know if I even trust my own self, so... thing is, I have a lot of things to fix and I know how to fix them now. Or at least I'm learning. When it comes to relationships, I was never really the guy that could fix anything or build a relationship that could really last. But, like I said, I'm learning. Framework. (Sound of drill)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: What is that? Hi-- yes, good morning. Is there is any construction going on in this building? There isn't? Oh. I must have been dreaming.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Are you kidding? Oh.",
        "Harley: What are you doing?",
        "Gus: What does it look like I'm doing? Finishing the house.",
        "Harley: No, you're not.",
        "Gus: Why not?",
        "Harley: Why not? There's too many \"nots\" for me to count. Let's start with, we already have a contractor.",
        "Gus: No, no, we don't have a contractor. We had three contractors. The first one moved to Venezuela. The second one just ripped us off. The third one doesn't even answer our phone calls. So no, this house needs to be finished.",
        "Harley: Okay, I'll find another contractor.",
        "Gus: No, no.",
        "Harley: I'll pay him double.",
        "Gus: We're not having any other contractors. This is it, I'm doing this house. Nobody touches this house but me.",
        "Harley: Uh, Gus? I know you. And I know how you operate. And this is you needing to prove something to me. But could you find another way to do it? You don't know a thing about construction. Should I remind you of that?",
        "Gus: Ow! Come here. Look at this, what is this? This is a book, right?",
        "Harley: Uh-huh.",
        "Gus: This is how people learn things. Look at this, nice color illustrations. Oh, that looks... well",
        "Harley: Looks like our contractor.",
        "Gus: The second contractor, right. So, I got these, I got the pictures, I even got some DVDs out of the library, okay? You can learn everything you need to learn from something like this.",
        "Harley: If it were that simple, just reading some things in a book, there'd be no need for contractors, because everybody would be doing it!",
        "Gus: Well, maybe I'll start a new trend. Maybe I'll get my own reality show. Yeah, this week Gus does gutters, how about that? Hm? I think I like that. I like the sound of that.",
        "Harley: It'll take you years.",
        "Gus: So what? It'll take as long as it takes.",
        "Harley: You're out of your mind!",
        "Gus: This house needs to get done, okay? And, uh, I really don't appreciate the fact that you have very little faith in me. And I intend to prove you wrong.",
        "Harley: Honey, you're not even starting it right. Look at what you're doing!",
        "Gus: What, I'm putting up a door on the house. The house needs a door.",
        "Harley: Yeah, yeah, houses need doors. They also needs insulation! Sheetrock!",
        "Gus: The house needs a door. I've got to put up something for you to slam when you get angry, okay?",
        "Harley: Houses need a lot of things. That's my point.",
        "Gus: What's your point? Go ahead, say it. Say it.",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Gus: You have something to say, just say it. What, the house needs a lot of things like what? Something I haven't been able to provide, is that what you want to say?",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Gus: Listen, I'll prove you wrong. Okay? New house, new start, new life.",
        "Harley: Listen to me. This is not a joke. What if you fall off a ladder and break your neck? You could get electrocuted. This is serious, Gus. Listen to me! What makes you think you can do this?!",
        "Gus: This is just something I've got to do. Excuse me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Dad, the man has never built so much as a birdhouse. This is construction work. It's dangerous. He could get hurt.",
        "Buzz: You're worried about him being hurt? That means you love him.",
        "Harley: Of course I love him, I always have. That's not in question; it never was. He thinks that if he finishes this house for me and the kids, that we'll all move in, everything will be hunky-dory...",
        "Buzz: Will you?",
        "Harley: It's not about where we live.",
        "Buzz: It's all right. I already said he's sober. He's going to meetings. So?",
        "Harley: Yes, but he scares me when he gets like this.",
        "Buzz: Like what?",
        "Harley: Driven. Single-minded.",
        "Buzz: Maybe he has to be that way to get where he wants to get to.",
        "Harley: It's like when I was found guilty, and he rented that dive apartment across from the prison. It's like... Daddy, he was willing to give up his whole life for...",
        "Buzz: For you! Some things never change.",
        "Harley: (Grunts)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Door works! All right, what's next? Let's go with plumbing. Yeah. It's cake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Okay. Let's quick, quick, quick. We're going to pack that bag for camp tomorrow, and then I'm taking you to your dad's.",
        "Jude: I want to see Gus.",
        "Harley: Uh, we can't see Gus, because he's really, really busy right now. He's working on a special project.",
        "Jude: Please let me see him? He's sad.",
        "Harley: Okay. We'll go see Gus, but just for a few minutes. Jump! Good. Just remember, when we go in there, there's lots of nails and stuff on the floor, so be careful, okay? Come on...",
        "Gus: Hey! What's up, little man?",
        "Harley: He wanted to see you.",
        "Gus: Yeah, I wanted to see you too. Come here, let me show you something. This... sit right here. You like this? This is going to be your sink, in your bathroom.",
        "Jude: My bathroom?",
        "Gus: Yes, your bathroom. You're going to share that with your brother.",
        "Harley: You're going to install a sink?",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: Doesn't that need running water?",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: Which would require plumbing, something you know nothing about.",
        "Gus: I know everything about plumbing. Lower my pants a couple of inches, I'm a plumber, okay? And what I'm going to do is I'm going to connect the outside world with this house. See, and all the good stuff comes in. And lots of bad stuff goes out. And there's more where that came from, if you know what I'm saying. Just turn the faucet on.",
        "Harley: That's deep.",
        "Gus: Thank you.",
        "Harley: (Laughs) I knew it. You did hire a plumber. A professional, someone who knows what he's doing!",
        "Buzz: This, so they tell me here, is a female swivel pipe connector.",
        "Gus: Right.",
        "Buzz: And if I'm reading this diagram right, then the one we need now, of course, is a male.",
        "Gus: Mm.",
        "Buzz: Hello there. You made it! This house is going to have some bones! Oh, oh, you know in the, um...",
        "Gus: Laundry room, yeah.",
        "Buzz: The laundry room. The, the...",
        "Gus: Valve?",
        "Buzz: Valve, the valve! I found the correct valve.",
        "Gus: Oh, perfect.",
        "Buzz: You won't flood.",
        "Harley: That's comforting.",
        "Buzz: You want to stay here and help?",
        "Jude: Yes.",
        "Buzz: Yes!",
        "Harley: No! Uh, no, Jude is spending the night at his father's, and I will indulge this lunacy no further. Excuse us. Bye, grandpa! Say goodbye to grandpa.",
        "Buzz: Bye-bye.",
        "Gus: Bye.",
        "Buzz: She'll come around.",
        "Gus: You didn't see my rib-joint pliers, did you?",
        "Buzz: Relax.",
        "Harley: (Sighs)",
        "Gus: Hey, Buzz! You've been an incredible help, but maybe you should go home and get some rest?",
        "Buzz: Are you implying that I am too old to pull an all-nighter?",
        "Gus: No, I'm just saying that you've gone beyond the call of duty.",
        "Buzz: Shouldn't I be the judge of that?",
        "Gus: Well, that depends.",
        "Buzz: On what?",
        "Gus: Whether you have some sort of, uh... alternative motive-- ulterior motive.",
        "Buzz: Agenda?",
        "Gus: You know what I'm saying. Do you?",
        "Buzz: I know what you're saying.",
        "Gus: Well, maybe you do, I don't know, because... I made some mistakes, I hurt your daughter. I don't know, maybe you should be mad at me.",
        "Buzz: You are a remarkable man. I've never met anyone like you. You sacrificed yourself for my daughter. That being said, hell, yeah, I'm mad! You hurt my daughter repeatedly. I half hope that she'll just... not give you another chance. There's a certain kind of dad who would say, \"Cut him off. That's the end of it.\" But I'm not that kind of dad, you know. I didn't know I was a father when she was growing up. I crawled back to her too late to bed for the time of day, you know? I mean, how many years did it take her to forgive me? How many to trust, I mean, until she finally trusted me again? And how lucky did I feel when I got that trust? So we're, see, you're kind of like... see the parallel? Can't help myself. I'm rooting for you. Partly because you remind me of me, and partly... well, mostly, because she loves you. Okay. But, you know, if she gives you this chance, and you blow it...",
        "Gus: Wait, before you say anymore, it doesn't involve you and Frank and Coop and a lot of pain and some quick drying cement and a long trip down the Jersey turnpike, because if it does, I...",
        "Buzz: It might involve Frank. But, you know, I've got things to take care of in my own life, you know? My own house to put in order. Who doesn't?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and email Noriko in Tokyo and tell her about the new dates, make sure she's up to date with it. Um... what's next? The board meeting, that's right. Okay.. Gruen wants to go ahead and present the results he got from the new marketing survey we did. Harley?",
        "Harley: He's setting himself up for a major fall. You see that, don't you?",
        "Dinah: Okay, so we're back with Gus and the house again, eh?",
        "Harley: The hard part hasn't even started yet. You know, he thinks he's got this whole thing all figured out. But he doesn't realize, he's running on adrenaline right now. What happens when the problems start to come up? What happens when... when the building inspector doesn't give us a permit, or they send over the wrong flooring or the wrong tile? You know, the problems. And Gus' whole big \"I'm going to build you a house\" plan comes crashing down! What happens then, huh?",
        "Dinah: You deal with it, is what you do.",
        "Harley: What if we can't? What if there's bad weather? You know, there's something, there's always something. There's going to be some new temptation or some old habit, you know, and all that hope, and all that hard work is going to be for nothing.",
        "Dinah: Are we talking about the house here?",
        "Harley: Huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: What is happening up there?",
        "Buzz: Just give me a minute! Just give me a minute.",
        "Gus: This is my whole life in the balance! Come on, how much longer?",
        "Buzz: Just a... okay, all right, okay, are you ready?",
        "Gus: Yeah, yeah. No, wait. (Whispers) Please let this work, please. Okay! Ready?",
        "Buzz: Okay!",
        "Gus: Fire in the hole! (Toilet flushes) (Laughs) Yes, I hear it! Yes!",
        "Buzz: Yes, yes! Hey!",
        "Gus: Yes! (Laughs) Oh, it's excellent.",
        "Buzz: Well done.",
        "Gus: Yes! It's better than the super bowl.",
        "Buzz: It's a toilet bowl.",
        "Gus: It's a toilet bowl! (Laughs) (music playing)",
        "Buzz: Okay, that's it. I'm done.",
        "Gus: Ah, look at you. You're finally going to admit that you're tired.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, well... (mumbles) Because the next thing is the electrical.",
        "Gus: Oh, yeah.",
        "Buzz: I don't know squat about electrical. You know anything about electrical?",
        "Gus: Oh, yeah, yeah, I'll manage. I'll manage.",
        "Buzz: Are you kidding me?",
        "Gus: What?",
        "Buzz: You can't... do-it- yourself plumbing is one thing. I mean, you make a mistake, the floor gets wet. Do-it-yourself electrical, you get fried!",
        "Gus: No, I'll be fine.",
        "Buzz: No, call an electrician.",
        "Gus: Okay, I'll call an electrician.",
        "Buzz: Gus, no, a licensed electrician.",
        "Gus: I will call an electrician.",
        "Buzz: No, you won't!",
        "Gus: And you go home and get a little bit of sleep. Oh, you were fantastic, thank you.",
        "Buzz: It was a good. Gus, it was a great flush!",
        "Gus: Close the door, huh? (Laughs) Close the door! I finally get to say that. Okay, \"The electrical rough-in. First determine where the electrical panel will be located.\" It's right there. Yes, I can do that. \"Now you mark the locations of all the outlets and the switches and fixtures.\" Cake, cakewalk. \"And then you follow the installation instructions applied to a three-phase, three-wire grounded B phase 240 vac system.\" What? (Knock at door)",
        "Mallet: Hello, Mr. Craftsman, Mr. Carpenter.",
        "Gus: Hey.",
        "Mallet: Oh, no. You don't have a clue what you're doing, do you?",
        "Gus: I'm fine. I'll manage.",
        "Mallet: Here, take this. Let's see.",
        "Gus: No, no, I need this.",
        "Mallet: Oh, no, that's garbage. That's garbage. Trust me.",
        "Gus: What are you talking about?",
        "Mallet: You don't need that.",
        "Gus: Yes, I do need this.",
        "Mallet: No, you don't, you need an electrician. You don't need that book.",
        "Gus: What, did you two come down here to just harass me?",
        "Dinah: We came to help.",
        "Mallet: Wasn't my idea.",
        "Dinah: Oh, come on. He really just wants to show off.",
        "Mallet: No, actually, I want to see you in a tool belt.",
        "Gus: You guys don't have to do this.",
        "Dinah: We want to.",
        "Gus: Well, what if I don't want you to?",
        "Dinah: You're going to pass up some free help?",
        "Gus: You punched me in the face.",
        "Dinah: That was for your own good, mister!",
        "Mallet: Okay, guys, enough, enough. All right? Time for a man's man to do some man's work.",
        "Dinah: That's right. Woof, woof! Go for it, honey.",
        "Mallet: You're killing me, sweetie. Is this the... forget this book. Is this the wiring plan?",
        "Gus: Don't pretend you know how to read that thing.",
        "Mallet: Do you know how to read this?",
        "Gus: I will after I read chapter 17.",
        "Mallet: Would you forget that book? I'm telling you, it's trash. It'll get you into trouble. Now listen. We need to find a power box.",
        "Gus: It's right there.",
        "Mallet: I used to know how to read one of these. No, on the plan.",
        "Gus: Oh.",
        "Mallet: I worked for an electrician for two summers in high school.",
        "Dinah: See, I told you he wanted to show off. Very good.",
        "Mallet: Actually, I figured if... you know, I could help you finish this house, then maybe... you know, if you could do a halfway decent job, then maybe someday down the road, we could be partners again. I don't know, maybe it's a stupid idea. Power box! Power box, right in this room, here on this wall.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: You just want to go over to the house again so you can see Gus again, right?",
        "Harley: Hello, food delivery. That's all.",
        "Frank: So you're just going to take the food over there, and then you're going to leave.",
        "Harley: Don't give me a hard time, Frank.",
        "Coop: Frank, stop giving her a hard time.",
        "Harley: Thank you.",
        "Frank: Okay, you over there, you be quiet. And you, don't be so easy on Gus, okay? He hasn't been sober for that long. What? What are you looking at?",
        "Coop: What? It's her husband we're talking about here. You know what? If she wants to be with him, she should be with him. All right? Yes, don't be too easy on him. But you know what, she shouldn't be too hard on him, either, okay? The guy, he got addicted to painkillers after he had major medical problems, all right? So he's more of a victim here than he really is a criminal. And I think, Frank, that you should be a little bit more compassionate.",
        "Frank: More compassionate? I'm showing a lot of compassion here, okay? My first priority is our sister's happiness, okay? And guess what? You weren't here for a number of years.",
        "Coop: Thank you, Frank, I know that.",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, you know, you didn't see what Harley went through. Okay, with Phillip, and with Mallet and all that. It took her a long time to be able to trust a guy again. You know, and this isn't the first time Gus has let you down, either.",
        "Harley: Well, it's not the first time I've let him down, either.",
        "Frank: No, no, no, not like this. All I'm saying...",
        "Harley: I know what you're saying! Okay? You don't think I'm scared? I'm petrified to believe in Gus again and have the whole thing fall apart, because I love him so much. And these ups and downs are killing me! But losing him would be a lot worse. So this is me trying to find a middle ground. I'm trying to help him without enabling him, and I'm trying to be kind to him without being a patsy. Is that okay with you? Or do you have any other words of wisdom you'd like to throw my way?",
        "Frank: Look, if that's what you want...",
        "Harley: It's what I want. Thank you. (Door slams)",
        "Frank: Bingo.",
        "Coop: Yes!",
        "Frank: (Laughs)",
        "Coop: (Laughs) Nice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Gus? Hey, Gus, are you here. I brought... (gasps)",
        "Gus: Hello! (Laughs)",
        "Harley: You look terrible. Why don't you go home and get some rest? Seriously, what's going on? Your generator broke? Why is it so quiet in there?",
        "Gus: Because I shut it down. We don't need it anymore.",
        "Harley: (Laughs)",
        "Gus: Come inside. Come inside!",
        "Harley: Okay.",
        "Gus: Okay, watch your step! Oh, lovely. Groceries. Come on, let's go. Let's go.",
        "Harley: (Shrieks) I can't see anything!",
        "Gus: I want to you show you something. Now look at that. What's that? See that?",
        "Harley: That's a light switch.",
        "Gus: That's right. I want you to go ahead, hit that.",
        "Harley: No, I'm not touching that.",
        "Gus: You should hit that, go ahead. Hit that.",
        "Harley: I'm not going to touch it, because if you did it wrong, I'm going to get electrocuted...",
        "Gus: I'm asking you to do the honors and just push the button. Just push it, please!",
        "Harley: You did it! You did it!",
        "Gus: Yeah, no, no. Not me. I didn't do it. We did it.",
        "Buzz, Mallet, and Dinah: Surprise!",
        "Gus: It's good, right? What did you get us?",
        "Mallet: All right, Gus, did you buy... did you buy another bundle of shingles? Because if you didn't, then we just ran out.",
        "Gus: That's a good question.",
        "Mallet: Uh-huh. You have a good answer?",
        "Gus: I think I brought all the shingles up here, but there might be another bag downstairs. I'm not sure.",
        "Mallet: Do you think, or do you know?",
        "Gus: Don't look at me like that.",
        "Mallet: I'm not looking. I'm looking for shingles.",
        "Gus: No, you're looking at me like I'm an idiot, like I don't know what I'm doing, like I'm hanging on by a little thread here, okay? Who's the one that got the whole lights going?",
        "Mallet: Uh, I think that was me.",
        "Gus: Well, who got the plumbing going? That's not easy to do, plumbing, got a toilet going.",
        "Mallet: Buzz. Buzz did the plumbing.",
        "Gus: What, are you trying to make me feel bad about myself?",
        "Mallet: Jeez, man, watch out!",
        "Gus: Whoa.",
        "Mallet: Easy, bud, it's a long ways down. You should clear your head. You're on a roof.",
        "Gus: Yeah. It's a good thing that we're getting along; otherwise it could be a bit of a dicey situation.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, it'd be a little tricky, a little messy.",
        "Gus: Somebody could get hurt.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, you could get hurt, or I could get hurt. Let's just make sure it's you or me and nobody else.",
        "Gus: What, are you still trying to go beyond the call of duty and protect my wife from me? You're probably very happy I'm having marital problems at the moment, and that I'm trying to get into her good graces again.",
        "Mallet: No, see, this shows you how much you don't know. You want to know the truth? This is the truth. I think you're... I think you're kind of a screw-up on a lot of levels, and plus, you're an addict to boot.",
        "Gus: A recovering addict.",
        "Mallet: Okay. And you're a pain in the butt, and you're a so-so partner. I also think you're an unbelievable slop. You're roofing in your socks, for God's sakes. But you know what I also think is unbelievable, is I kind of... get, I kind of understand what Harley sees in you.",
        "Gus: You're making me blush.",
        "Mallet: You know what I also think is equally unbelievable? I actually think you're going to finish this house for Harley. So do you want to finish this house sooner, or you want to finish it later? Let's go, come on.",
        "Gus: What do you think? What do you think?",
        "Mallet: I think you're going to keep on needing my help, so why don't we just stop ticking each other off?",
        "Gus: I'm going to go check on the shingles.",
        "Mallet: Good, I'll come with you, because I have to check in at the station. Oh, hey, Gus. What was said on this roof...",
        "Gus: Yeah, yeah. Stays on the roof.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Look at this!",
        "Harley: Hey!",
        "Gus: For somebody who doesn't approve of my work ethic, you sure hang around a lot.",
        "Harley: Even fools have to eat.",
        "Mallet: Am I included in that statement?",
        "Harley: You're here, aren't you?",
        "Mallet: No, I can't, not for long. This fool's got to get to his real job.",
        "Harley: Oh.",
        "Mallet: See you.",
        "Harley: See you.",
        "Gus: Take it easy.",
        "Harley: Don't eat the muffin cap!",
        "Gus: Why?",
        "Harley: So you guys were on the roof together and nobody got thrown off?",
        "Gus: Well, I dangled him from his ankles a little bit.",
        "Harley: Did it make you feel better?",
        "Gus: A lot better. What's next? What's... that's my last book over there. Yeah, insulation! Insulation.",
        "Harley: I have to say, I can't believe what you've done here. You know, I mean, the toilets flush and the lights work, and... you know, it's a great accomplishment.",
        "Gus: Yeah, it's a good start, solid foundation. I'm going to keep going.",
        "Harley: Yeah?",
        "Gus: Oh, yeah. Can't turn back now.",
        "Harley: How's that muffin?",
        "Gus: Muffin's delicious.",
        "Harley: (Laughs)",
        "Rick: Be careful, be careful. Look who's here.",
        "Harley: Wow, look who's here!",
        "Rick: He really wants to see you guys.",
        "Harley: I didn't think I'd see you guys till 4:00.",
        "Rick: Well, actually something came up that, uh... that we need to talk about.",
        "Gus: Hey, Jude, come here. I want to show something. Me and your grandpa put in a toilet. You can go to the bathroom in it and everything. How would you like to flush it?",
        "Rick: Wow. Got the electricity all set up and everything.",
        "Harley: I know. Insulation is next.",
        "Rick: Wow. And I'm assuming once the construction's done, you're going to be moving right in here with Gus, right? You and the kids?",
        "Harley: Um... we haven't actually talked about that yet.",
        "Rick: Well, that's actually something we need to talk about.",
        "Harley: Excuse me?",
        "Rick: I've decided, Harley, that it's much, much safer for Jude to live with Mel and me.",
        "Harley: You've decided?",
        "Rick: Just for a little while, until we know that Gus is 100% better-- which he's not right now. So I had Mel draw up a letter that amends the arrangements of our custody. Why don't you take a look at it? Harley, it's fair. It's for our son and his safety. Just take a look at it.",
        "Harley: I'm not going to look at it, because it's garbage. I can't believe you'd have the nerve to come over here and even suggest something like this. My friend?!",
        "Rick: I can't believe you have the nerve to think that I would let our son stay in a home with a drug addict, Harley. Come on.",
        "Harley: This coming from the man responsible for killing Ross Marler?",
        "Rick: I can't believe you said that. You know I'm a good father. I'm not going to hurt my son.",
        "Harley: Well, you can't tell me that you didn't show unbelievably poor judgment, and that a man died as a result of that. At least the only person that Gus has hurt is himself!",
        "Rick: Well, for now! And what about, you left him up... you've left him here while you took off to Europe with the children? So you're telling me you trusted Gus with the kids by doing that?",
        "Gus: I understand what you're saying. You know, I can sympathize and everything. But you need to understand something.",
        "Rick: No, you know what, Gus, you don't... you don't understand. When you have a kid, you'll understand.",
        "Gus: No, I do understand. Now, you need to understand that I am clean, okay? And I'm going to meetings every day.",
        "Rick: Gus, I wish the best for you, because I care about you and I want you to get better. I do, because I've been where you're at, and I know how tough it was, man. I was a drug addict in med school. I said all the same things you're saying now. You know, I made all these promises to all the people I loved, and meanwhile I had a... these pills burning a hole in my pocket.",
        "Gus: Yeah, well, you're not me. I'm not you.",
        "Rick: Okay. Fine. My understanding is that Harley works full-time at Spaulding, and you don't have a job right now, which means you'll be spending a lot of time with the kids. And I tell you, I'm just not comfortable with that.",
        "Harley: Get out of my house.",
        "Rick: Don't be an unreasonable parent.",
        "Harley: Get out.",
        "Rick: Fine. Jude? Son, it's time to go home. Come on. Okay, say good-bye to mommy.",
        "Harley: I'm going to see you at 4:00. Okay, baby? 4:00. 4:00. Have fun with daddy.",
        "Gus: (Sighs) You defend me like that... I want you to know you don't have to, when I know that deep down inside, you don't even know if you can trust me. Right?",
        "Harley: You want to know what I know about insulation? Insulation keeps things that are inside the house from drifting away. And it keeps the people inside the house from getting colder by what's outside. That's what I know about insulation.",
        "Gus: Very deep.",
        "Harley: Did I ever tell you about the time that Frank showed me how to put up insulation? That looks good.",
        "Gus: Yeah?",
        "Harley: Is it supposed to be that loose?",
        "Gus: What? I don't know, you're the insulation expert. You tell me.",
        "Harley: I never used the word \"Expert.\"",
        "Gus: Well, you told me that you built a house with Frank.",
        "Harley: It was a doghouse, and it was like ten years ago.",
        "Gus: Wait, excuse me, it was a doghouse? You told me that you... I cannot believe you. Let me tell you something. In the middle of the winter, when we're freezing our butts off and I say I want a blanket, you have to get me a blanket, just like that, every time I ask for one.",
        "Harley: The important thing is not to panic, okay?",
        "Gus: I'm not panicking.",
        "Harley: We've got the book. We'll look at chapter 12, make sure we're doing all right. That's all.",
        "Gus: Oh, she wants to read my book now. She wants directions. Look who's living in my world, eh? You like this, don't you?",
        "Harley: Listen to me. I am 80% sure it's perfect.",
        "Gus: 80%?",
        "Harley: I meant 90%!",
        "Gus: 80%?",
        "Harley: I meant 90%!",
        "Gus: Oh, it's 90%.",
        "Harley: It looks good! Look, honey, look at it!",
        "Gus: It looks so good that we should actually build houses for people across the United States. What?",
        "Harley: (Laughs)",
        "Gus: Don't you think? (Thunderclap) Uh-oh. Ooh.",
        "Harley: Wow, that's close. I think it's going to pour.",
        "Gus: That's not good, no. That's really bad, actually.",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Gus: Well, you see, the... the thing is that Mallet and I didn't really finish this whole roof thing, because we ran out of shingles.",
        "Harley: You ran out of shingles?",
        "Gus: Yeah. I was going to get them to... see, the problem is, if we don't put a tarp on this thing, I'm going to be forced to rip this whole roof off and start over again.",
        "Harley: No, what is this \"I\" thing? It's \"We.\" We are going to be forced to rip everything out. So we are going to the roof together to put the tarps on.",
        "Gus: Good. I'm just going to use the new toilet first.",
        "Harley: Okay? We're in this together. Come on.",
        "Gus: Oh, I was going to use the new toilet. (Thunderclap)",
        "Harley: (Shrieks)",
        "Gus: Keep the tarp down so the wind doesn't get under it! It'll act like a sail!",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Gus: I said keep the tarp down. The wind will go under it, and act like a sail and pull you off the roof.",
        "Harley: I feel like I'm getting pulled off the roof!",
        "Gus: Don't look down!",
        "Harley: That's your big advice? Don't look down?",
        "Gus: Honey, we can do this. Okay?",
        "Harley: Can I hold onto this chimney?",
        "Gus: Sit down and slide to it if you're going to hold it.",
        "Harley: It's slippery!",
        "Gus: Okay, hold onto the chimney, hold onto the chimney. It's okay.",
        "Harley: The chimney is made of metal! I could get electrocuted. This is crazy! This is stupid!",
        "Gus: Yes, it's crazy! Yes, it's stupid! It's not safe! You should go downstairs and just let me do this by myself!",
        "Harley: No! No! If you can do this, I can do this! (Thunderclap)",
        "Harley: (Whimpering)",
        "Gus: Get your hands off the chimney!",
        "Harley: Right, right. Okay, right. Honey, this isn't a good idea. This is a bad idea. I think we should go down. It's not meant to be.",
        "Gus: But we've come so far, and we've just done so much already.",
        "Harley: It's crazy!",
        "Gus: Yes, it is, in a way. But when you think about it... when you think about it, you put your love and your sweat and your tears into something that's really important to you, and the whole thing becomes everything. You understand me? You following me?",
        "Harley: There's too many tears. There's too many cracks. I'm going down!",
        "Gus: Okay.",
        "Harley: There's no ladder!",
        "Gus: What?!",
        "Harley: The ladder fell! The ladder fell. There's no ladder. There's no way to get down!",
        "Gus: Oh! (Thunderclap) Okay. See, we made it. We're still here.",
        "Harley: Uh, yeah, exactly. That's the point. We're still here. We still don't have a way to get down. Oh, my gosh, the ladder! The ladder!",
        "Gus: Who is it?",
        "Harley: Oh, my gosh. I don't know.",
        "Gus: Careful.",
        "Harley: Okay. Hello! Thank you! Who are you?",
        "Gus: Who is it?",
        "Harley: I don't see anybody. I'm going down.",
        "Gus: Okay, well, I'll help you.",
        "Harley: You already have.",
        "Gus: You are a champion.",
        "Harley: No. You're et. (Laughs)",
        "Dinah: Hey, took you guys long enough. Come on! Come in here. Hurry! Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.",
        "Mallet: Guys, come on, get in here. We got food. Roast beef and salsa and some sweaty salami...",
        "Buzz: Don't tell them it was your idea. It was my idea.",
        "Frank: No, it was your idea. It was a great idea. Dad figured out a way to attach a tarp on the inside of the roof, and we didn't have one drop of rain.",
        "Coop: Yeah, so we averted the crisis. Oh yeah!",
        "Harley: Is that a wool blanket?",
        "Mallet: Yeah. Isn't that nice?",
        "Harley: Am I dreaming?",
        "Dinah: Nope, this is a party! P-A-R-T-Y. A pre-housewarming party.",
        "Frank: Actually, it's a work party, and we figured if we work through the night, then we can get a bunch of stuff done, so... and we did.",
        "Rick: Need another pair of hands here?",
        "Harley: What are you doing here?",
        "Rick: Just thought I'd help.",
        "Frank: Hey, Rick.",
        "Rick: If it's all right with you guys.",
        "Buzz: I think he may be reconsidering about Jude. Make nice.",
        "Harley: Mm-hmm. The more, the merrier. Right?",
        "Gus: Well, that's the funny thing about stranding yourself on the roof. You work up an appetite.",
        "Harley: (Laughs)",
        "Buzz: (Laughs)",
        "Gus: Come on, we'll eat. Have some crackers and some cheese. (Music playing) Ain't no river wide enough, baby If you need me call me No matter where you are no matter how far don't worry, baby Just call my name I'll be there in a hurry You don't have to worry 'cause baby there Ain't no mountain high enough ain't no valley low enough Ain't no river wide enough to keep me from getting to you, babe...",
        "Harley: This is a beautiful house.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: Don't you think? I mean, this house is more beautiful than I ever imagined it could be! The only way the boys and I are moving in here, though, is... is if you move in with us.",
        "Gus: I don't know.",
        "Harley: You want me to beg? Okay. I'm sorry. I was wrong. I didn't always believe in you. I didn't always believe in us.",
        "Gus: Well, I gave you a couple of reasons.",
        "Harley: I gave you some, too.",
        "Gus: Yeah, this house could be great. It's got a lot of potential, you know?",
        "Harley: Yeah.",
        "Gus: It's got a lot of potential. We could make a lot of fresh memories here.",
        "Harley: This is our house, you know? This is the first house that we've ever had that didn't have somebody else's past, you know? No ghosts, a clean slate.",
        "Gus: This house can be anything... anything we want it to be. Anything.",
        "Harley: It already is everything I want it to be. It's our home.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: You're going to paint it, right?",
        "Gus: There's no money for that. Ain't no river wide enough to keep me from getting to you, babe...",
