        "Michelle: Whew! That was amazing. I have never ever gone that fast in my entire life.",
        "Tony: Yeah. How you know?",
        "Michelle: Because 85 on a bike? On country road? At night? That is something that i would remember.",
        "Tony: It's very cool, huh?",
        "Michelle: Oh, man. And I feel so much better. I was so close to going off on somebody at that party.",
        "Tony: Yeah. I gathered that.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, well, my husband forgets to tell me i have a son. And then he got the mayor there telling me i'm the heart of soul of some family i don't even know anything about. And then everybody staring at me expecting me to turn into some wonderful little mommy michelle... Oh. No, thank you, tony, for getting me away from there.",
        "Tony: Oh, please, michelle, don'T... Listen don't thank me. I wanted to leave too, you know. You know what? Let's just... I don't know. We'll enjoy this and we'll calm down, relax, head back to town. What do you say?",
        "Michelle: I want to keep going. I mean it, tony. I don't care if I ever go back.",
        "Cassie: Any word from michelle?",
        "Danny: Nope. But she's okay. She's with tony. I'm sure she's fine.",
        "Cassie: She seemed to be a little overwhelmed by the festivities.",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: How's robbie doing?",
        "Danny: He's confused. But I guess it could have been a lot worse. What?",
        "Cassie: This is very hard for you, too.",
        "Danny: I'm doing all right. I'm just trying to keep it all together for michelle. Try to keep clean.",
        "Cassie: Now that you are clean.",
        "Danny: Cassie, is there something you want to say to me?",
        "Cassie: I hate to pile it on, but when it rains it pours.",
        "Buzz: You know what? For about the clean up. Lets just move on to another party. I have two-- count them, two weddings on tap for my little family. That is cause for massive celebration.",
        "Harley: Oh, daddy.",
        "Frank: And apparently constant bragging. You're cute, father. All right. You ready for the station?",
        "Harley: Sure. Yeah. Hey, gus, do you...",
        "Gus: Do i, what?",
        "Frank: Well, she was going to ask you if you wanted to come to the police station with us, but there's no reason to do that. I was just going to pick her brain a little so...",
        "Gus: Yeah, pick her brain about what?",
        "Frank: About the brad green drug case.",
        "Buzz: You're still on that?",
        "Frank: Yes, i have a few questions about it.",
        "Gus: Well, I can answer questions that you have.",
        "Frank: No, that's okay. This one is hard to get a hold of so...",
        "Alexandra: That case is still open?",
        "Frank: Till i say it's not.",
        "Gus: We're a family of terriers.",
        "Alexandra: So i've noticed.",
        "Harley: I won't be long.",
        "Gus: Can we talk?",
        "Alexandra: Forget talking. You've got to go after them two. You've got to find out what frank knows and what he is trying to get out of harley.",
        "Gus: I cannot do this anymore. Do you understand me? No more.",
        "gus: I am through lying. Do you understand?",
        "Alexandra: Gus, you're just protecting your family.",
        "Gus: What i'm going to do is follow my fiance around like i'm a spy or something so do that the chief of police doesn't get any closer to the truth? Is that what you want me to do?",
        "Alexandra: I just want you to stay one step ahead of them, because they can't find out about that note. Besides it doesn't mean anything anyway, gus. You know that. But don't stop now, not when the jobs just half done.",
        "Gus: I used to be a detective. And now I'm just a liar. Do you realize that I'm getting married in a few weeks and this should be the happiest time of my life? But now this little mess... This little mess could cost me the only person I've ever loved.",
        "Darci: Do you trust, alex?",
        "Buzz: Do I... (Laughs) you mean because she's a spaulding?",
        "Darci: It's just that harley had some trouble over the years with them.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, they put her through a lot. Do i trust alex? I trust her enough to hurt me. That's enough for now.",
        "Gus: I hate this. I hate this. I'm not that good at this. Half the time I think that harley's on to me anyway. She could tell. She could tell.",
        "Alexandra: Gus, put out this one fire. I promise you by the time the wedding comes around... By the time it rolls around, all of this would be forgotten.",
        "Gus: One little fire.",
        "Frank: All right, let's do this one more time. Right up until the bust, you were in the beacon lobby and gus was in the wine cellar. Is that right?",
        "Harley: Yes, that's right, frank. Would... Would you look at us. I mean it's fourth of july, you know, we're both about to marry these wonderful people, and are we with them? No. We're here at the police station hanging out with an evidence box.",
        "Frank: So what?",
        "Harley: I just think there's something wrong with this picture.",
        "Frank: Yeah, I think that this case should not be considered closed.",
        "Harley: Frank, I was there, okay. It was brad green who dropped the antimonious in the wine cellar. The danny came along, he took the drugs and left a briefcase of salerno's money in it's place. And it was brad green who came out of the wine cellar with that briefcase in his hand. I mean, it's pretty straight forward, don't you think?",
        "Frank: Darci told me that brad green and alexandra were partners. I think alex is up to her eyeballs in this.",
        "Harley: And that's why you didn't want gus to come down here? Because you want me to help you nail his family.",
        "Michelle: Whoa! Whoa! Did you know there's a waterfall down there?",
        "Tony: Pretty amazing, right?",
        "Michelle: Wow. Wow. This place is unbelievable. Where are we?",
        "Tony: Well--",
        "michelle: No, no, no. Wait, wait. I know where we are. I know where we are. Don't tell me. This is... This is laurel falls, right? This the place that danny told me about when I was in the hospital.",
        "Tony: Your memory did it. You did it. You remembered.",
        "Michelle: You're a funny guy.",
        "Tony: Yeah, well, okay, listen, michelle, I brought you here for a reason. Okay, I did.",
        "Michelle: Because this is where danny and I were going to build our dream house, right?",
        "Tony: Different reason.",
        "Michelle: All right, let me guess. We... We camped out here. We got engaged here. We gave the big guy, little guy, whatever his name is a birthday party. Did you see how that kid put his arms around me today at the party?",
        "Tony: Yeah. That was tough to watch. But I know it was tougher on you, because he's your son and he loves you.",
        "Michelle: He ought to be loved back, tony. I don't even know who this kid is.",
        "Tony: Michelle, you will. I know that.",
        "Michelle: I can't give what this kid needs, tony. And that's not right",
        "tony: You're dealing with what you've got, michelle. It's all anybody could do, you know.",
        "Michelle: Yeah.",
        "Tony: Am I right?",
        "Michelle: So was I a good mother?",
        "Tony: You were in fact the best.",
        "Michelle: Of course. I shouldn't even ask that question. I mean, I'm michelle bauer, right? I'm just the best, you know... Fill in the blank. What am I? The best mother, daughter, sister, doctor in training. I'm the pillar of the community, right?",
        "Tony: You know what? It beats being the worst.",
        "Michelle: No, i am competing with my own, history, tony. How am i supposed to live up to everything i was?",
        "Tony: It's simple. Don'T.",
        "Michelle: What?",
        "Tony: You're trying so hard to measure up to the old michelle. I'm telling you, stop trying to.",
        "Michelle: I can't, tony. I can't just say, \"forget it. I'm done trying to figure out who I was.\"",
        "Tony: Why not?",
        "Michelle: Because...",
        "Tony: Because why?",
        "Michelle: Maybe there's some people counting on me.",
        "Tony: So?",
        "Michelle: Okay, now you're doing a 180 on me.",
        "Tony: No, no, no. I'm not, michelle.",
        "Michelle: Yes, you are. Yes, you are. Because that day in the hospital when i was having my whole identity crises melt down, you said to me to knock it off or suck it up or something like that.",
        "Tony: That is exactly what i said.",
        "Michelle: And now you're telling me the complete opposite?",
        "Tony: No, i'm not. I'm just telling you that i see... Okay, look, michelle, I do. Look, I see the pressure that people are putting on you right now. Okay, I do. They are looking at you. And they are watching. And they are hoping. I also see that they have this image of you and how you should be and if you don't live up to that, you're going to let them down. Now to me honestly that's the worst kind of pressure there is.",
        "Michelle: And what if i'm never the same?",
        "Tony: You know what? You'll be different.",
        "Michelle: And what if people hate me, tony?",
        "Tony: They're not going to hate you. They're not. If they do, you know what? Let them. It's their loss, michelle.",
        "Michelle: How do you mean?",
        "Tony: You may end up hundred times better than you were.",
        "Michelle: I guess i never really thought about it like that.",
        "Tony: I think you should.",
        "Michelle: Maybe so. When's my birthday, tony?",
        "Tony: You know, i should remember this, but i... I...",
        "Michelle: Don't worry about it. Forget it.",
        "Tony: I do.",
        "Michelle: It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. You know why? Because now I can just officially declare today as my birthday. Today.",
        "Tony: Okay. All right, time to be reborn.",
        "Michelle: Yes.",
        "Tony: All right.",
        "Michelle: Today, I am free. I am free to start over. (Yells) free to start over.",
        "Cassie: I got a call from the bank.",
        "Danny: About what?",
        "Cassie: The government loans for fifth street. They're due. Actually, they're overdue.",
        "Danny: Don't worry about it. I'll take care of the payments, okay.",
        "Cassie: Okay, i'm sorry, I'm still a little freaked out because you didn't tell me that you were using dirty money for fifth street when I co-sign those government loans for you. And you put me and my family at risk. So are you sure you have the money, danny?",
        "Danny: Yes, cassie, i have the money.",
        "Cassie: All right. Since you brought down salerno, I know your cash flow...",
        "Danny: I told you the money's not a problem. Drop it, will you?",
        "Cassie: Well, now that you've got some extra hands, I'm going to head home. Thank you so much. See you later.",
        "Buzz: Well, good night, my soon to be daughter-in-law. Thanks for making my son happy. And I wouldn't wait up for him.",
        "Darci: I will.",
        "Buzz: I know you will. What's that the coldest shoulder in recorded history or what?",
        "Alexandra: Really? I didn't notice. I mean some people just don't like me.",
        "Buzz: Well, how could anyone not take an instant and permanent liking to such a gentle soul?",
        "Alexandra: Stop.",
        "Buzz: What's up?",
        "Alelexandra: Nothing. Nothing.",
        "Buzz: Don't give me that. Come on.",
        "Alexandra: No, no, buzz. I'm fine.",
        "Buzz: You're not going to tell me?",
        "Alexandra: (Laughs)",
        "buzz: Well, the i'm not going to tell about the mystery item that landed in alan spualding salad that i didn't warn him about. (Alex laughs) I'm not going to tell you.",
        "Alexandra: Why is everything so simple when i'm with you?",
        "Buzz: You know there was a time when I would have been offended at that.",
        "Alexandra: Well, don't be. Don't be. For heaven sakes with you I can breath, breath. Oh, god, why didn't we meet years and years ago, when it was still time to make some different choices.",
        "Buzz: I would have ruined your life.",
        "Alexandra: I doubt that.",
        "Buzz: I was bad news.",
        "Alexandra: (Moans)",
        "buzz: What is all this about? You have me here right now.",
        "Alexandra: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That's true. Very true. Very true.",
        "Buzz: And in a couple weeks when gus and harley tie the knot, we'll be related. (Gasp for air)",
        "alexandra: Again.",
        "Buzz: Again.",
        "Alexandra: Baby does that scare you?",
        "Buzz: A little. But I'm sort of looking forward to it, sharing eveththing now that we're connected. A bright future.",
        "Alexandra: Yeah. You think so?",
        "Buzz: How can you even doubt it?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, dear, I don't know.",
        "Harley: You want to bust gus's family and you want me to be your hit man.",
        "Frank: That's not true.",
        "Harley: I am his fiance. We're getting married.",
        "Frank: I understand that. I understand that.",
        "Harley: You remember? But you are asking me to conspire against the man that i have pledged my life to. I just had this conversation with dad.",
        "Frank: Will you take it easy?",
        "Harley: About how i am working so hard to meet this great belief of faith to trust the spualdings again, to trust gus, to trust our relationship. How could you ask me to do this?",
        "Frank: Exactly how much do you really know?",
        "Harley: Don't make me do this. Don't make me do this, frank. This is... This is the spaulding's, we're talking about. These people are throwing my wedding. This is gus' family. And he needs to know if they're involved.",
        "Frank: I can answer that for you right now.",
        "Michelle: Coming up on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Marina: If sandy's going to jail, I should, too.",
        "Sandy: No problem.",
        "Michelle: How deep would you say that water is below the waterfall?",
        "Tony: It's pretty deep.",
        "Michelle: Yeah?",
        "Tony: Yeah.",
        "Michelle: Good.",
        "Tony: What are you doing?",
        "Michelle: Whew! honey.",
        "Gus: What are you doing? You don't have to answer that. I know what you're doing. This is about your resentment, right? Your doubt.",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Gus: My family, they put you through the wringer. Caused you a lot of pain. Can't let go of that resentment. That's why you can't wrap your arms around the fact that maybe brad green acted alone in this little dirty drug scam. That's just the kind of thing that would involve alexandra spaulding. Maybe even alan spaulding.",
        "Harley: Don't do this.",
        "Gus: Don't do what? Am i wrong? Is not about my family? What's it about? It's about me?",
        "Harley: It's not about you.",
        "Gus: No. But I... Sorry, honey, i understand you. You're just following your cop like instincts, right?",
        "Harley: I go to head back to the bauers.",
        "Frank: Okay. That's all right. That's fine.",
        "Harley: Are you staying?",
        "Gus: I got a lot of paper work to do, you know. So i'm here. I might as well do it.",
        "Harley: Okay, i'll see you later then.",
        "Gus: All right.",
        "Harley: You got the car keys?",
        "Alan: You're all probably wondering why I called you down here tonight.",
        "Lizzie: Well, it did sort of cross our minds, yeah.",
        "Alan: There is a fool among you. Earlier today at the bauer barbecue i decide to do a little personal business via my computer. And I discovered that someone had hacked into my personal file. A file that contains very private and sensitive information of mine.",
        "Lizzie: They didn't get into our bank account, did they?",
        "Alan: No, not that, elizabeth. But they did leave me this. They thought they were so clever using my own words against me.",
        "Marina: If it's so clever, how could whoever did it be a fool?",
        "Alan: Because breaking into one's personal computer is trespassing. And it's against the law. Now I know one of you is responsible for this. You have one of two choices: Come to me and confess or we will take whatever means necessary to ferret you out. The choice is yours.",
        "Sandy: Hey, boss? What if the choice is stand up right here and confess? Is that okay? Because I sent you that message.",
        "Danny: Look, sorry. Okay, I didn't mean to snap at you. I really didn'T. Cassie...",
        "Cassie: It's okay.",
        "Danny: No, it's not. Look, you're entitled to an explanation. You are. When i asked you to co-sign those loans for me, I thought i could have it all. I could have it both ways. Take the dirty money and keep it a secret. Believe me, I am still finding out how wrong I was. Every time i look into michelle's eyes and see a stranger, I'm reminded. Or when people who have been good to me look at me like i'm stranger, I'm reminded.",
        "Cassie: You're a hero.",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: That's what the papers are saying. You took down the mob.",
        "Danny: I should be able to generate some more business and income. So don't worry about the loan payments, okay?",
        "Cassie: Okay.",
        "Danny: Are we okay?",
        "Cassie: We're okay.",
        "Danny: Okay. It's just... You know, money has not been on my mind, which is ironic given that it used to be the only thing on my mind. It's just with everything going on, it's very low on the priority list.",
        "Cassie: I know. I get that, and I'm sorry. I didn't mean to badger you. I just...",
        "Danny: No, no. It's... Hey, you're...",
        "Cassie: I'm just real sensitive right now, danny. I have someone running all over europe with a credit card in my name.",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Cassie: But they're paying it, so i don't know.",
        "Danny: It's not much of a scam.",
        "Cassie: I know. It's like a weird kind of identity theft. I know that I've been pretty angry with you lately, and this is going to sound really weird, but if you need anything, anything, please call me.",
        "Danny: Thank you. Michelle didn't even know her own son today. She held him in her arms and felt nothing. So i don't know what anybody can do about that. What makes it worse is that it's like she doesn't even feel the loss. It's like it never existed. It doesn't make any sense. I mean, I'm grateful to have michelle back, i am. But it... Then again, it's like she's not michelle. But she is michelle. It's just so confusing. This is when you tell me that she's going to get all of her memory back.",
        "Cassie: I can't do that.",
        "Danny: Yeah, I know.",
        "Cassie: But there is a way that you can get back what you had with michelle.",
        "Danny: How?",
        "Cassie: Make her fall in love with you again.",
        "Michelle: You know, it was really rude of you not to give me a birthday present.",
        "Tony: All right, hold on, hold on. Who says that I don't, huh?",
        "Michelle: Really?",
        "Tony: Really. All right, here we go.",
        "Michelle: Yeah?",
        "Tony: Here we go.",
        "Michelle: All right.",
        "Tony: Celebrating your birthday, right?",
        "Michelle: Yes.",
        "Tony: Okay. I'll get you this little thing here ready, flatten it out. No, I'll tell you what. Give me your hand. Give me your hand.",
        "Michelle: All right.",
        "Tony: Keep it right there.",
        "Michelle: Mm-hmm.",
        "Tony: Now, we're going to have to move fast.",
        "Michelle: Okay, i'm ready. I'm ready. Come on. Come on.",
        "Tony: You're ready? Sure?",
        "Michelle: Yep.",
        "Tony: All right.",
        "Michelle: Okay.",
        "Tony: Here we go. Now... Wait.",
        "Michelle: Okay.",
        "Tony: There you go. Blow. Now, we will have better candles next year.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, but i want the same cake, all right? No different.",
        "Tony: Okay. All right.",
        "Michelle: Yes. Mmm.",
        "Tony: Good?",
        "Michelle: Mm-hmm. It's awesome.",
        "Tony: So what'd you wish for?",
        "Michelle: I don't remember.",
        "Tony: Okay.",
        "Michelle: You know...",
        "Tony: Yeah?",
        "Michelle: I can see why danny would want to build a house here. It's really nice. It's special.",
        "Tony: In a lot of ways. Mm-hmm.",
        "Michelle: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Tony: Nothing. Nothing. It doesn't mean anything.",
        "Michelle: Oh, wait. Excuse me. This is straight-talking tony. Come on.",
        "Tony: It's nothing.",
        "Michelle: Tell me. Tell me what you were going to say.",
        "Tony: I was just going to say that this is one of the places that you and danny had your wedding. One of your weddings, I should say.",
        "Michelle: And?",
        "Tony: That this is also the place that you were almost murdered.",
        "Michelle: So a wedding and a murder attempt, huh? See, that is something that i wish i could remember.",
        "Tony: You two were great together, michelle, you were. The thing is, you guys came from two different worlds, and I mean night and day.",
        "Michelle: Okay. I was raised in a doctor's family with middle-class comforts. How about danny?",
        "Tony: Danny's family had money, but he grew up in a really rough neighborhood in chicago. But I will say the families had one thing in common.",
        ">Michelle;: What's that?",
        "Tony: They hated the idea of you two being together. They hated it. But you and danny, you stuck it out, you fought, because you wanted to be together. No matter that the families kept pulling you apart anyway.",
        "Michelle: Right.",
        "Tony: This is why he built this place. This is why he wanted to build the house up here, michelle, so you guys can get away and you can start your life together and have something away from that crazy world that the santoses live in.",
        "Michelle: So the santos world is crazier than the bauer's? Come on.",
        "Ty:Y: Yes. Yes, they are.",
        "Michelle: All right. Well, you've got to tell me how. You've got to tell me why. Come on. Tony?",
        "Tony: Michelle, this is up to me to tell you. This is for danny, your husband, to talk to you about.",
        "Michelle: Well, you already are. You already are. So look... You know, see, the thing is, you see, i got a feeling when i woke up that you guys were keeping some, like, big secret from me.",
        "Tony: You did?",
        "Michelle: Yeah. Yeah. And now I'm getting the feeling that maybe that's the whole reason why danny and i had such a hard time staying together. Maybe even why i almost got myself killed.",
        "Tony: All right. You had mother-in-law issues, okay?",
        "Michelle: All right, keep going.",
        "Tony: Danny was not raised to be a lawyer. He was not raised to be a doctor, okay? He is a mob boss. That's what he was raised to do, michelle.",
        "Michelle: What?",
        "Tony: Yes. The santoses were a part of organized crime for generations. It's the family business. That's what we've done. And his mother carmen, danny's mother carmen, she was the boss, as tough as they come. She was grooming him. That's what she was doing. She was grooming him to take over the job, okay? And then a problem came up.",
        "Michelle: Me?",
        "Tony: Yes, you. You and danny fell in love. She saw you as a threat, so she took steps.",
        "Michelle: And she tried to kill me. Okay.",
        "Tony: A couple of times. I don't know. I don't know. In carmen's mind, she was protecting her own interest, okay? But I will say to you that danny's attitude did change when he met you, michelle.",
        "Michelle: How?",
        "Tony: Because he realized that he wanted something more for you and for robbie, okay? He did. He... Michelle, he wanted you... He wanted you and robbie to be safe, to be happy, to be proud of him and what he's done. That's what this place is all about. And he did that, because he brought down the mob. And he's clean. He's out.",
        "Michelle: Wow. I... I mean, i don't even... A mob boss. I married a mob boss. Danny just seemed so, like, straight-laced to me. Obviously he's got another side to him i haven't even seen.",
        "Tony: I hope you don't have to.",
        "Michelle: Wow. He really must love me a lot to give up all that.",
        "Tony: That was the only reason he left, he got out. He did it for you and michelle. And like i said, he's out. He's clean.",
        "Michelle: Well, what about you? You a reformed bad guy, too?",
        "Lizzie: It was you?",
        "Marina: No way. Sandy's always kidding around. Sit down.",
        "Alan: You have a lot of nerve, mr. Foster.",
        "Sandy: Right back at you, mr. Spaulding.",
        "Shayne: Sandy, chill.",
        "Remy: What, do you have a death wish?",
        "Sandy: You move us around like we're these little pawns on your little chessboard, and get off on watching us squirm. Does that make you feel powerful, bullying people half your age?",
        "Alan: Does it make you feel powerful to sit in a dark room and hack into my personal computer and pretend to make some kind of statement?",
        "Sandy: Oh, I think the statement was made.",
        "Alan: Tell me something. Do you think adults are all idiots, and youth is savvy and cool?",
        "Sandy: The statement wasn't that global. You messed with our privacy, so i messed with yours.",
        "Alan: Ah, a simple case of tit for tat then, huh?",
        "Sandy: There was another reason.",
        "Alan: I'm listening.",
        "Sandy: I wanted to know if you had anything that could stop me. There's my answer.",
        "Alan: You know, you're a very talented young man.",
        "Sandy: Yes, i do know that. Thank you.",
        "Alan: Well, you've very welcome. And I know just the place for you-- jail. Take him away.",
        "Shayne: Come on! That's crazy! Alan...",
        "Sandy: I'm not going to squirm. You might as well just have them shoot me.",
        "Alan: Don't give me any ideas. Take him.",
        "Marina: No. Tell them to let him go right now.",
        "Gus: So frank, what is it that darci told you made you want to take a closer look?",
        "Frank: So you saw us talking?",
        "Gus: Yeah, I did, right before you said you wanted to pick harley's brain.",
        "Frank: Well, the truth is, gus, that right now I'm going more on my gut feelings than on evidence. You know, on darci's gut feelings. She told me that she thinks that alexander and brad green are partners.",
        "Gus: Right. You know, frank, sometimes i think that... Sometimes I think that we all want to know the truth, you know, but really, we'd be so much better off just living in this blissful ignorance.",
        "Frank: Yeah, I know what you mean. But not on this case.",
        "Gus: Frank, you're the chief of police, right? You know what the problem is here? You don't have enough indians running around for you, detectives. This is what they should be doing for you, you know? The fact of the matter is, you know, I'm the one detective that knows everything about this case. And the next logical step is that i handle it for you, and then i just keep you updated on everything that's going on, all right? I'll start that right now.",
        "Buzz: Hey. You're here. You're back. What are you back for?",
        "Harley: Me and frank, we cut short the whole police station thing. And I wanted to see you.",
        "Buzz: Well, you're seeing me. This is me sweeping. What's wrong?",
        "Harley: Remember how earlier you said that you were proud of me because i had taken this great leap of faith in marrying gus and letting the spauldings throw my wedding?",
        "Buzz: I remember a sweeping, heartfelt comment along those lines. What about it?",
        "Harley: I think my leap of faith has turned into a crisis of faith.",
        "Alan: You give me one good reason i shouldn't haul him off.",
        "Marina: Because he didn't do it. Not alone, anyway. I'm the one who came up with that message. Oh, yeah. The password, too.",
        "Alan: Well, marina, you've had quite a busy day, haven't you?",
        "Marina: Well, maybe it's not over yet. I mean, if sandy's going to jail, I should, too.",
        "Alan: No problem.",
        "Shayne: Marina, what are you doing?",
        "Mitchell: Don't worry about it. It's just an act. He won't have me arrested. We're practically family.",
        "Alan: Ah, but not yet. Why don't you plead your case to your father in your nice cozy cell? I understand it's not your first time. You'll have company.",
        "Shayne: Hey! Hey, guys, look. Don't worry about it, okay? I'm going to get in touch with ross, my parents, whoever. I'm going to get you out of this, all right?",
        "Alan: Thank you all for coming.",
        "Cassie: Come on. You remember how easy it was for michelle to fall in love with you the first time. Make it happen again.",
        "Danny: Okay, first of all, it was not easy. She's not the same person at all. And how am i supposed to do that?",
        "Cassie: That's not the issue. It's the loss of closeness with her that is really hurting, isn't it?",
        "Danny: Yeah. Yeah. It's like we're miles apart.",
        "Cassie: Then change that, danny. Come on. You can do it. Get back what you guys had. I mean, is there anything better than just falling in love?",
        "Danny: I guess there'd be nothing to get in our way this time.",
        "Michelle: I've been so busy trying to get a handle on who i was, i just kind of skipped past danny. I didn't even... I just looked at him, he was like the dutiful husband, and moved on. But, i mean, if we meant that much to each other on so many levels, then there's got to be a lot more danny that I haven't discovered.",
        "Tony: And it's up to you to dig deeper if you want.",
        "Michelle: Yeah. I'm free to do that now, aren't i?",
        "Tony: If it's important to you, yeah.",
        "Michelle: See, you know, the thing is, tony, it's one thing when people have expectations, but it's a whole other thing when it's your husband and it's your son counting on you, right? And they do. They count on me.",
        "Tony: Yeah. Yeah, they do.",
        "Michelle: So I owe them that. You know, maybe not to be who they remember me to be, but maybe just to be who i am and just see how it goes.",
        "Tony: You might like it, michelle.",
        "Michelle: You know, an hour ago I just wanted to keep going. I wanted to go where nobody knows who I am. And now I'm thinking that that would be running away, right?",
        "Tony: Maybe.",
        "Michelle: You're no help, you know that?",
        "Tony: What do you mean, i'm no help?",
        "Michelle: Just kidding. You've helped me a lot, tony. Thank you. Thank you for telling me about danny and your family.",
        "Tony: You don't have to thank me, michelle. You were going to find out sooner or later.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, but you know what? I'm glad i found out tonight, because it's going to make it a lot easier to go back.",
        "Tony: Is that what you want to do?",
        "Michelle: Yeah. You know, maybe we can try to be how we were, but as we are.",
        "Tony: Okay. Well, you know, it's getting a little late, so why don't we head on out?",
        "Michelle: Hang on a second, because I want to give myself a birthday present.",
        "Tony: Here?",
        "Michelle: Mm-hmm.",
        "Tony: Okay.",
        "Michelle: How deep would you say that water is below the waterfall?",
        "Tony: It's pretty deep.",
        "Michelle: Yeah?",
        "Tony: Yeah.",
        "Michelle: Good.",
        "Tony: What are you doing?",
        "Michelle: (Yelling)",
        "tony: Michelle!",
        "Frank: Listen, I appreciate you wanting to help, but i can take care of this.",
        "Gus: No, it's not a problem, frank, i swear. It's not a problem.",
        "Frank: I don't think you understand. This case has now become personal for me.",
        "Gus: Why, because of what darci told you? Frank, it's, like, personal for you. I saw her talking to you at the barbecue. She looked pretty upset. I mean, if you're doing this for her sake...",
        "Frank: No, there's another reason. The drug antimonious that was smuggled in has now ended up as delirium. Do you know what delirium is? It's one of the most dangerous drugs to hit the streets right now. And guess who's targeting... The drug dealers are targeting. Teenagers. And guess who's a teenager? My daughter marina.",
        "Gus: Frank, i understand. I understand...",
        "Frank: Did I ever tell you the reason why i became a cop? Because I really wanted to make a difference in this town. I wanted to go after the lowlifes who were victimizing good innocent people without a second thought. And if there's anybody left that's still attached to this whole deal that's managed to slip under the radar, they'd better not get too comfortable, because I'm going to go after and I'm going to find them. And I'm going to throw them in prison to rot. And that's a promise from frank cooper.",
        "Buzz: When you and phillip split up, you said you were never going to get married again, not only to a spaulding, but to any man. And voile, here you are taking the plunge not only with a man, but with a spaulding. You would be crazy not to feel some trembling, some jitters, some fear.",
        "Harley: Well, you're with a spaulding, dad. How's your faith holding up?",
        "Buzz: I get spasms of paranoia.",
        "Harley: Uh-huh.",
        "Buzz: You know, i mean, you know, we take a lot of lickings from that family. But alexandra's taught me something.",
        "Harley: To drink heavily when you're around them?",
        "Buzz: Not to look off to the next problem. It's a lesson. You're in love. You look to that, to love. Hang in there.",
        "Harley: Look to love, huh? Marie green, it's harley cooper. I know it's late. I know. But this couldn't wait. Listen, you told me that over the years you had had various detectives checking out brad's affairs with other women. I'm assuming that includes the time he was in paris. Good. Listen, I need everything that you've got, anything that involves the connection between brad and alexandra spaulding. Yeah, asap.",
        "Danny: Next on \"guiding light,\" brought to you by cover girl...",
        "Olivia: Well, then, if he's focusing on what we're doing on a personal level, maybe he won't look at the fact that we're trying to steal his company."
