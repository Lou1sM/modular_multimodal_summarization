        "Dinah: Did you like it? ",
        "Mallet: Wow. Oh, baby, oh, baby! ",
        "Dinah: Was it good? ",
        "Mallet: That\u2019s... wow! That's quite a way to start the day there. ",
        "Dinah: Okay. Well, you don't know anything because you haven't had it all \r\nyet. ",
        "Mallet: Hmmm. ( Laughs ) ",
        "Dinah: Huh? Okay, which one is it? ",
        "Mallet: Hmm, that's nice, too. I'd try them all over again to make sure which \r\none. ",
        "Dinah: Honey. ",
        "Mallet: God, that is good. ",
        "Dinah: Come on. You've already had pineapple dream, coconut heaven. We've got \r\nto make a decision. These things, you've got to order them, like, nine months \r\nahead of time. I told my mom I would give her an answer by tonight. ",
        "Mallet: We haven't even picked out a date and your mom is overnighting \r\nwedding cake samples to us. Come on. ",
        "Dinah: Honey, come on, she's into it, she's into it. And given my track \r\nrecord with men, it's actually a really good sign. ",
        "Mallet: It's our wedding, okay? It's our wedding, just you and me, so why \r\ndon't we tell Vanessa we'll have our cake and eat it in our own time? Ah, yeah. \r\nMmm. Your turn. ",
        "Dinah: Okay. I don't think I have tried berry bliss. ",
        "Mallet: Berry bliss. ",
        "",
        "Matt: Why bother planning food, flowers, invitations? You should just drag \r\nthe minister along if you're so hot to see this wedding happen. ",
        "Vanessa: Now when did you get so cynical? ",
        "Matt: Vanessa this is Dinah we're talking about. Odds are she's going to \r\nshred this relationship long before the two of them get anywhere close to an \r\naisle to walk down. ",
        "Vanessa: A couple of years ago, I may have believed you, but not now. She's \r\nchanged. ",
        "Matt: Uh-huh. ",
        "Vanessa: She has. She's grown up, and she's found the man she loves. ",
        "Matt: Yeah, well, I hope so, for your sake. ( Laughter ) ",
        "Mallet: Come in. ",
        "Vanessa: Oh, a surprise... where's the... ",
        "Dinah: Hi, Mom. ",
        "",
        "Olivia: Hi. ",
        "Buzz: Hi. ",
        "Olivia: Hey, I thought you were off today. ",
        "Buzz: Oh, so you thought you would just sneak in and leave me a note. ",
        "Olivia: No, no. ",
        "Buzz: Well, it has my name on the envelope. But that sort of makes sense \r\nbecause I've been trying to get a hold of you since the barbecue, and I just \r\nmissed you somehow. ",
        "Olivia: Yeah. ",
        "Buzz: So you're trying to avoid me. Why? ",
        "Olivia: Well, it's all here in the note. I just wanted to clarify... ",
        "Buzz: I'm here. Say it to my face. ",
        "Olivia: Okay. I may have overstated my situation with Frank. ",

        "Alan: Excellent work, Milton. I assure you I will not forget this. ",
        "Lizzie: Granddad. ",
        "Alan: Well, is everything all right with the baby? ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, it's fine. Me, too, in case you're interested. What are you \r\ndoing here? ",
        "Alan: Well, your mother told me you had an appointment with the doctor, and I \r\ntook it upon myself to come by and pick you up. ",
        "Lizzie: Hmmm, poor pathetic Lizzie with no husband to pick her up from the \r\ndoctor\u2019s. ",
        "Alan: Now sweetheart, you are not alone in this. The whole family is behind \r\nyou. ",
        "Lizzie: I want Coop. Jenna and I want Coop. ",
        "Alan: Coop is out of the picture permanently, and I think you need to start \r\nthinking about a different name for your child. ",
        "Lizzie: It's so hard. ",
        "Alan: I know, I know. But remember, she's a Spaulding, not a Cooper. ",
        "Lizzie: She's not even born yet. And actually, if you want to be technical, \r\nshe's a Randall, which kind of makes her a Lewis. So I should name her Reva? ",
        "Alan: Never. Now, she's a Spaulding, and she will be named appropriately. I'm \r\nalso going about getting Mr. Randall removed from the picture permanently as \r\nwell. ",
        "Lizzie: You still haven't told me how. ",
        "Alan: Don't concern yourself with that. You take care of the baby, and I'll \r\ntake care of the rest. ",
        "Lizzie: You know, I actually think that Jonathan would have stayed away from \r\nme if you hadn't started messing with him in the first place. ",
        "Alan: He made a serious mistake defying me, and he will regret the day that \r\nhe returns to Springfield, I assure you. ",
        "",
        "Jonathan: Nothing like breaking and entering. ( Laughs ) ",
        "Tammy: So this is the plan? You're going to be cute and funny, and we're not \r\ngoing to talk at all about what happened here the other night. ",
        "Jonathan: There is nothing to talk about. ",
        "Tammy: You stood up to Alan Spaulding in front of the whole town, Jonathan.\r\n",
        "Jonathan: Well, he got on my nerves, Tammy. ",
        "Tammy: There is more to it than that, and you know it. You had every right to \r\ntear up that... whatever it was, that agreement. You are that baby's father. ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, but does that mean I want to play daddy? No. And does that \r\nalso not mean that we can't start our lives over new right now. I mean, check it \r\nout. Outskirts is open, we're going to get a lot of money coming in from the \r\nsummer crowd, and there's a lot of partiers in that bunch. Speaking of which, \r\nlet me go see if I can steal a beer from the Bauer fridge without getting \r\ncaught. ( Laughs ) ",
        "Process server: Are you Jonathan Randall? ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, what about it? ",
        "Process server: You've been served. ",
        "Jonathan: ( Scoffs ) \"Foreclosure proceedings on Outskirts.\" No way, man. I'm \r\nnot going to let you take my place from me. You show your face around here \r\nagain, I'll rip it off the front of your head. You got it? ",
        "Tammy: What's going on? ",
        "Jonathan: Nothing. This clown was just leaving. ",
        "Tammy: Who was that? ",
        "Jonathan: Nobody. ",
        "Tammy: He made you pretty mad for nobody. ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, well, he works for Doris Wolfe. ",
        "Tammy: What does she want now? ",
        "Jonathan: Another warning from the D.A. ",
        "Tammy: Great. ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. But, hey, it's going to be fine. We are fine. We're fine. \r\nCome on, let's go back in the tub. ",
        "",
        "Lizzie: Granddad, you do not have to go to war over my baby. ",
        "Alan: Your baby is the future to our family, and I will do anything to \r\nprotect its legacy. ",
        "Lizzie: Isn't that the mother's job? ",
        "Alan: In theory, yes. ",
        "Lizzie: Okay, okay. I will admit that some of the things I've been doing \r\nlately might seem a little uncool for the perfect mom of tomorrow. ",
        "Alan: I would agree with that. ",
        "Lizzie: Okay, yeah, but I am over all of that, Granddad, seriously. From now \r\non, all I want is what is best for Jenna. ",
        "Alan: I'm glad to hear you say that. Elizabeth, do you understand what is \r\nbest for this baby? ",
        "Lizzie: Sure. Anything healthy. ",
        "Alan: Yes, and to be around family. Totally surrounded by family with no \r\noutside interference. ",
        "Lizzie: Okay. So we will come visit a lot after she is born. ",
        "Alan: No, you will be living with us. From the very start, this baby will be \r\nwith us and I will be there to guide her every step of the way. ",
        "",
        "Dinah: We were doing what is called a blind taste test of all of the wedding \r\npieces of cake you sent us. ",
        "Mallet: Mmm, yeah, and we loved the lavender lust. ",
        "Dinah: Yeah. ",
        "Mallet: The pineapple dream. ",
        "Dinah: Front runner. Awesome. ",
        "Mallet: Our top choice there. ",
        "Vanessa: Good, I'm really glad that you were taking the issue of the cake so \r\nseriously. ",
        "Matt: Marriage is serious business. ",
        "Dinah: You would know, Matt. So, what brings you guys into town? ",
        "Vanessa: What? You. Both of you. I mean, we do have the issue of a huge, \r\ngorgeous, wonderful wedding to plan, right? I mean, come on. See what we \r\nbrought. I found some wedding organizers, and there's some lovely samplers in \r\nthere of invitations, and we can get good ideas. ",
        "Dinah: Invitations? I really haven't thought about the invitations. I mean, \r\nwe haven't even really set a date yet. ",
        "Mallet: We haven\u2019t... yeah. ",
        "Vanessa: Still? ",
        "Mallet: Well, we've both been incredibly busy, and we just... we haven't had \r\ntime... yet. ",
        "Vanessa: Oh. Well, when do you think your schedules might lighten up, loosen \r\nup so that you would have time to pick a date? The most important day of your \r\nwhole life. ",
        "Dinah: It's hard to say, but soon. Very soon. We're going to get right on it.\r\n",
        "Mallet: We're going to get right on it. We were... like with the cakes, we're \r\ngoing to get on it. ",
        "Dinah: So, why don't we go to brunch right now? ",
        "Mallet: Yeah, yeah, on us. ",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Yeah, we'll change and you guys wait for us in the lobby, and \r\nmeet you down there. And I'll take you some place fun. Promise. ",
        "Vanessa: Okay. All right. And then we'll talk about the wedding. ",
        "Dinah: Yes. ",
        "Matt: The wedding is not even going to happen. ",
        "Dinah: I just invited them to brunch. ( Laughs ) I can plan and book a root \r\ncanal right now. (Laughs ) ",
        "Mallet: It's okay. It's all okay. I think we're going to handle it. Mmmm, \r\nthis is orange-gazmic. ",

        "Olivia: You reminded me of this life that Frank could offer. ",
        "Buzz: You said you wanted to... ",
        "Olivia: To feel safe and secure, yes, I did want that. I do, I do want that. \r\nAnd you know, when I looked at all of those people and those families, I could \r\nimagine myself having that kind of life. And I tried to tell Frank that, but he \r\nwouldn't listen. ",
        "Buzz: And he ended it. You said he said it was over. ",
        "Olivia: Well, I was upset. ",
        "Buzz: He didn't actually say that it was finished? That it was over? He \r\ndidn't do that, that's what you're trying to tell me? That it wasn't that he \r\ndidn't have any feelings for you, he's just, sort of, you know, backpedaling?\r\n",

        "Buzz: Do you want me? Because he's going to kill me. ",

        "Beth: Honey, Alan says you refused to let him give you a ride home? ",

        "Beth: What? ",
