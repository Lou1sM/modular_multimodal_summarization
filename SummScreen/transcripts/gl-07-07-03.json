        "Tony: Marah, where are you going to hide these? Not that it would matter if Danny and Michelle don't show up.",
        "Marah: Tell me about it. Tony, where are they? How can we have a surprise wedding if the bride and groom aren't even here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: No. No they wouldn't.",
        "Josh: Look it, you're doing a tremendous job.",
        "J.O.P.: Thank you so much.",
        "Josh: How are you doing? Is that what you do for a living or is that a side thing?",
        "J.O.P.: Neither. I'm here on other business. I'm a justice of the peace. I'm officiating at a surprise wedding ceremony a bit later.",
        "Josh: Who's getting married?",
        "Marina: Uncle Sam!",
        "Zach: Uncle Sam! (Marina screams) J.O.P. Now they're going to pull my tails again.",

        "Cassie: Where did Reva say she left that camera?",
        "Tammy: Here it is.",
        "Cassie: Oh, great.",
        "Tammy: Great. Let's go.",
        "Cassie: Wait. I wanted to talk to you about something before we go to the barbecue. So, let's sit.",
        "Tammy: Okay, is something wrong?",
        "Cassie: No, no. In fact I think it's something good. And I hope you do, too. I know in a few days it's going to be a full year since your father died. And it's been a tough year. And I have missed him so much. I have. And I didn't think I could ever imagine for one minute sharing my life with another man. I mean the thought of that... But it looks like fate or whatever has had some other plans for me.",
        "Tammy: You're talking about Edmund.",
        "Cassie: I'm talking about Edmund, yeah. Edmund and I have been getting closer and I really enjoy spending time with him, and I hope you're okay with that.",
        "Tammy: If I wasn't, would you stop seeing him?",
        "Cassie: You dislike him that much? I can't say I blame you.",
        "Tammy: He has some good qualities, Mom. He was great about my prom, buying me the dress and stuff. But no matter how nice he is to us, he's still Edmund. After all of the terrible things he's done, I honestly don't think I could ever completely trust him.",
        "Cassie: You think you could try?",
        "Tammy: You invited him to the Bauer's, didn't you? That's why you wanted to talk about this now.",
        "Cassie: Yes, basically.",
        "Tammy: What a fun day this will be. I'll be the envy of all my friends.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shayne: Coming through.",
        "Marina: Thank you, Shayne. I was just waiting to wash my hair. Really.",
        "Shayne: Check this out. I just got this special delivery from the organization. They said this is the most official Cub's hat you could get. And it's yours.",
        "Marina: Thank you. So, Shayne...",
        "Shayne: Yeah?",
        "Marina: ... Your fans are dying to know: How does it feel to be the newest pitcher for the Chicago Cubs farm system as well as a future hall-of-famer?",
        "Shayne: It feels pretty darn good.",
        "Marina: (Laughs)",

        "Ed: Hey, how's it going?",
        "Rick: No, please.",
        "Ed: You did a good job. Have you noticed... Have you noticed that we are the only adult Bauer's at our own party?",
        "Rick: Well, Mel's got a quick meeting with the D.A. She should be back soon.",
        "Ed: What, on a holiday?",
        "Rick: O'Neill's a workaholic, Dad. You know what? If she ends up working with this guy, she's going to be one too.",
        "Ed: And so where's Michelle? Where's Danny?",
        "Rick: I don't have any idea. I have no clue.",
        "Ed: So they are the ones who lobbied for this thing and now we're the ones taking it over.",
        "Rick: Would you just stop complaining. Come on now.",
        "Ed: I'm not complaining.",
        "Rick: I saw you giving piggyback rides to all the children. You were having a blast and so is everybody else. In the end, that's what this gathering's all about, Dad. We're all here together with the people we love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: The fact of the matter is, Phillip, you've lost Olivia and your child now. And why? Because you were too honest, too ethical. Because your standards were too high. No, not at all. It's because you have stooped to the same manipulations and lies that you have accused me of all these years. I guess the apple didn't fall too far from the tree, did it?",

        "Josh: Excuse me. Have you guys seen Reva anywhere?",

        "Blake: I'm sorry.",
        "Josh: Okay. Well, thank you anyway.",
        "Phillip: What is the point of this? Are you just trying to goad me?",
        "Reva: I'm sorry. I don't mean interrupt. Is Josh... Have you seen him? Did he come through here?",
        "Phillip: No. I don't know. I haven't seen him.",

        "Gus: Hey, what's happening, Frank.",
        "Frank: Where's Harley? Have you seen my sister?",
        "Gus: She's helping the nanny put the kids down for a nap.",
        "Frank: Oh, good.",
        "Darci: Thank you.",
        "Rick: Another burger?",
        "Gus: No, I've got enough. Please. And you're burning everything.",
        "Rick: Darci, you want some?",
        "Darci: Oh, no, thanks. I've got to watch my girlish figure.",
        "Frank: I'll do that for you.",
        "Buzz: Oh, Frank, knock it off. We got to warm up.",
        "Frank: Warm up? For what?",
        "Buzz: For the egg toss contest. We came in second place last year. This year we're going to rule.",
        "Frank: Hey, Pop, listen, no offense, but I'm going to be teaming up with Darci this year.",
        "Buzz: Should've known. Pretty face, family loyalty, tradition out the window. Whatever. You.",
        "Gus: Yo. Right here.",
        "Buzz: You are about to become my son-in-law. You will be my egg toss partner.",
        "Gus: Well, Buzz, don't you think you could take me for a drink first? All right, prepare to be crushed, Frank. Excuse me for a second. Sis, I didn't think I'd see you here.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, she came with me.",
        "Eden: Come on, everyone gets to celebrate the fourth. Even murder suspects.",
        "Gus: Well, I'm sorry that I had to question you the other day. You know I have a job to do. It's not always the most popular one. I hope you understand.",
        "Reva: Excuse me, Gus? Alan and Phillip are talking in the kitchen. There's knives. (Laughs)",
        "Gus: Gotcha. Gotcha.",
        "Bill: Whoa! Might need backup.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Phillip, you could beg Olivia to come back all you want, but she's not going to come back to you now.",
        "Phillip: Tell me what any of this is to you?",
        "Alan: Let me ask you something. If she did come back to you, would you really want her? I mean, wasn't your attraction to her in the first place because she was forbidden? Isn't that why you stole your father's wife from him in the first place?",
        "Phillip: I didn't steal her from you.",
        "Gus: Hey. Rick's looking for you.",
        "Phillip: Hmm.",
        "Gus: He's burning everything on the barbecue.",
        "Phillip: That's okay. We're finished here.",
        "Alan: No, we're not.",

        "Lizzie: No.",
        "Young girl: Come with me. Come on, come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lillian: Oh, I don't know. Lizzie seems to be having some fun.",
        "Beth: Yes, seems being the operative word. I don't know, Mom. I really can't get a read on her lately.",
        "Rick: Hello.",
        "Lillian: Hello.",
        "Beth: Hello.",
        "Rick: Having a good time?",
        "Beth: The best.",
        "Lillian: You know I have not seen you at the hospital in a long time. Are you too busy with that new job?",
        "Beth: Oh, yes, how is that? Isn't that creepy seeing so many dead people?",
        "Rick: Oh, you get used to the dead bodies. It's the hours I can't get used to.",
        "Beth: Worse than medicine?",
        "Rick: It's this new D.A. This guy Jeffrey O'Neill. The guy's an absolute tyrant.",
        "Lillian: Speaking of tyrants, where's your wife? Where's Mel?",
        "Beth: Nice, Mom.",
        "Rick: With O'Neill.",
        "Lillian: Oh.",
        "Rick: She's seen me have so much fun, now she wants to work for him, too.",

        "Rick: See you later. Have a good time.",
        "Lillian: Thank you.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you've passed test number one. Willing to walk away from holidays and family obligations when the boss calls.",
        "Mel: Well, I'm a doctor. I understand emergencies.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you may not always understand my idea of an emergency.",
        "Mel: Well, like you said, you're the boss. So I guess I'm just going to take your word for it.",
        "Mayor: Jeffrey? Dr. Boudreaux, good to see you.",
        "Mel: You, too, Mayor.",
        "Mayor: Your father wiped the tennis court with me the other day.",
        "Mel: Yeah, he told me.",
        "Mayor: Yeah, that Clayton, so humble. (Mel laughs) Well, Jeffrey, what's so important that you need to see me this minute? I do have a parade to get to.",
        "Jeffrey: What's so important, Mr. Mayor, is that it is independence day. The day our forefathers declared their freedom from tyranny and impressive rule. And I in my own little way am going to follow in their footsteps. Yes, that's right, Mr. Mayor, the beard is back. Whisker here, whisker there, whisker everywhere. It's a whisker revolution, Mr. Mayor. If you don't like it, fire me.",

        "Tammy: Mom, sometimes when everyone in town loathes a person, there just might be a valid reason for it.",
        "Cassie: Don't you think loathe is a pretty strong word, Tammy?",
        "Tammy: Well, how did you feel when he locked you in that tower? Or when he caused you to have that car accident and then you had a miscarriage, Mom? Or how did you feel when he totally went against your wishes and brought charges against Aunt Reva for what she did to Dad?",
        "Cassie: Okay, I was furious, all right? But I'm not anymore.",
        "Tammy: Why? Because he had this bright idea to build a library in Dad's honor? Because he shows you a little affection? Are you that desperate for attention? I'm sorry.",
        "Cassie: No, it's okay. You know what? I'm sure a lot of people think that. But the answer to that question is no, I'm not desperate, Tammy. I'm not desperate at all. I'm with Edmund because he gives me what I need and he makes me happy in a totally different way than Richard did. But does he make me happy. And he has changed, okay? He has changed. And I understand that you are weary. I really do. But if you open your mind and you give Edmund a chance, you will see what I see and you will understand why I feel the way I feel for him.",
        "Tammy: This sounds serious. Is it?",
        "Cassie: I don't know.",
        "Tammy: So what's next? Edmund moves in with us?",
        "Cassie: No, not at all.",
        "Tammy: And we all play the big happy family routine one more time with another guy? What happens if they send him back down to San Cristobel? Or they send him off to be ambassador of some other country? Are we going to move there again?",
        "Cassie: Wait. Wait. Wait. All right. None of that has happened, okay? Not yet.",
        "Tammy: But it could at some point? Just promise me two things, okay, Mom?",
        "Cassie: Okay, what?",
        "Tammy: Number one, don't tell me too many details about you and Edmund, because it really grosses me out. And number two, please, please talk to me before you make any major decisions. Especially ones that'll affect me and the boys.",
        "Cassie: You know I would do that. You don't have to ask. Look. Look, everything is going to work out. We just need to keep an open mind, okay? Can we do that?",
        "Tammy: I will if you will.",
        "Cassie: Okay, great.",
        "Tammy: We should get to the barbecue. I'm sure Edmund's waiting for us and I'm sure no ones talking to him. (Cassie sighs)",

        "Marah: Wait, wait, wait. I know you have another wedding to go to, but please, please, the bride and groom will be here any minute.",
        "Tony: Yeah. Just stick around for a little. Please. Please.",

        "Marina: All right, you heard it here first. Shayne is on his way to the major leagues. (Cheers and applause)",
        "Lizzie: That's great, Shayne. You must be on cloud nine.",
        "Shayne: Life's pretty good right now.",
        "Lizzie: I'm so happy for you.",
        "Marina: So do you have any nibbles for endorsements yet?",
        "Shayne: Are you kidding me? I don't even have a locker room yet. And then I have pay my dues in triple A. And they might even start me in double A.",
        "Marina: Oh, please, though. I mean you're going to be on the road, you know, you're going to be living the dream.",
        "Shayne: You know, I'll be in Chicago a lot, right? I'm going to come back here all the time.",
        "Marina: (Laughs) Please, you're going to be like traveling around to all these amazing places and having a blast. Why would you ever want to come back to Springfield?",
        "Shayne: I have my reasons.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: They're still lining up.",
        "Ed: Come on. Bases ready. On your mark, get set, go! Back up. Back up.",
        "Beth: Lizzie said she wanted to be part of the three legged race and now she just walked off. Well, you called it, Mom. As soon as she got home from school you said that she was in trouble.",
        "Lillian: Yes, I know. But remember when you were in trouble, I didn't know. It took me so long to admit that, honey.",
        "Beth: But you did admit it. And we got help.",
        "Lillian: Look, I am very proud of what you're doing to help Lizzie.",
        "Beth: Mom, the thought of her hurting and not being as happy as she should be...",
        "Lillian: I know. But you and I will be sure she gets all the love and support she needs, right?",
        "Beth: Right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I found this. Marah left it in a brown paper bag on a picnic table on the patio.",
        "Josh: Did you see the guy playing Uncle Sam? He's a justice of the peace. He told me that himself. He was hired to come here and perform a surprise wedding.",
        "Reva: Oh, no. That's it. They're getting married.",
        "Josh: She's so young though. I mean how long has he held down a legit job? For less than a year.",
        "Reva: I know. And now with Shayne leaving the house it's too much.",
        "Josh: What are they thinking?",
        "Reva: We're going to have to talk some sense into them.",
        "Josh: I agree. I'm with you. But wait. Wait. Wait. Wait a minute. What? What if we're misunderstanding something here?",
        "Reva: Like what?",
        "Josh: I don't know. But what if we are. What if we go find and we put down our collective foot and it's about nothing.",
        "Reva: Marah won't like that. She won't like it at all.",
        "Josh: Maybe it's a practical joke that somebody's playing. I realize that sounds far fetched, but I think we need more information. How about a little reconnaissance? You talk to Marah, I'll talk to Tony, okay? And maybe we'll get them to spill the beans.",
        "Reva: Good idea. You lead the way.",
        "Josh: Okay, let's do it.",

        "Mayor: O'Neill, you're actually willing to lose your job over a little facial hair?",
        "Jeffrey: I have a strong aversion to shaving, Mr. Mayor. And, besides, I don't think the good people of Springfield really care whether I have a beard or not. I think they care about whether I do a good job or not. Of course we can always send my new clerk out to take a poll on the matter if you'd like. Dr. Boudreaux, I think the mall would be a good place to start? Don't you?",
        "Mel: You want me to go out and ask some people?",
        "Jeffrey: Of course not. That's ridiculous.",
        "Mayor: Fine. Keep your damn beard if it's that important to you. Now if you don't mind, I have constituents waiting.",
        "Jeffrey: Of course... Of course, Mr. Mayor. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And happy fourth of July.",
        "Mel: Wow, the declaration of independence over your beard. If this the type of challenging work that I can look forward to if I come work for you. Great.",
        "Jeffrey: Now the mayor needed to know how far he could push me and now he does. And you know what? I am starving to death. Let's say we go get a burger.",

        "Edmund: Hi.",
        "Cassie: What are you doing out here? Why didn't you go inside?",
        "Edmund: Well, I was inside for a little bit and then I thought I'd fair better with some reinforcements.",
        "Tammy: Good idea. Let's go.",
        "Edmund: Hi, Tammy. Hi.",
        "Cassie: Hi.",

        "Lillian: Yeah, of course.",
        "Beth: (Laughs) Not again.",
        "Rick: Egg toss is ready to start. We need a team.",

        "Frank: We got a team right here. Darci and I.",
        "Buzz: And you have me and what his name.",
        "Rick: Okay. What about Harley, Mr. Cooper?",
        "Buzz: Where is Harley?",
        "Gus: She's upstairs taking care of the kids. He's got sensory overload. Well, we'll be right over here.",
        "Rick: Oh, that's okay.",
        "Cassie: Hey.",
        "Rick: Hey.",
        "Cassie: Did you say egg toss?",
        "Rick: I sure did. Are you in?",
        "Cassie: Yes. Sign up me and Edmund.",
        "Rick: Okay.",
        "Buzz: So where have you gotten all this practice, huh? Down in San Cristobel between the teas and the tiddlywinks and the coups?",
        "Edmund: No, Buzz, actually, this will be my first foray and to the cut-throat world of American lawn games. But I don't think I'll fare too badly.",
        "Frank: Oh, we'll see about that, Eddie.",
        "Phillip: Gus really seems to be buying into this whole warm and fuzzy father routine. When are you going to start to ruin his life?",
        "Rick: We got the egg toss coming up. I'm assuming you love birds are going to be teammates?",
        "Alan: Nah. No, I don't think so. Because you see Phillip avoids competition, Rick.",
        "Rick: Oh.",
        "Alan: Because he's afraid that he will lose.",
        "Phillip: Hang on just a second. If this means that the great and powerful Alan Spaulding has deigned to participate in a game of egg toss with the little people, how could I say no? Sign us up.",
        "Rick: Oh, the little people.",
        "Phillip: Sign us up. Sign us up.",

        "Reva: How are we going to find out what's going on without being obvious?",

        "Josh: Yes.",
        "Rick: But we're going to do the egg toss. Are you guys yes, no, maybe? We got to get going here.",

        "Marah: Really? I had no idea that you felt so strongly about it. Tony and I actually just already signed up.",
        "Reva: Oh. Well, of course you did. I mean why wouldn't you. Why would you want to play a silly old game with your silly old mom.",
        "Josh: You know what? That's okay. We can play as a team. It'll be okay.",
        "Reva: Sure.",
        "Tony: No, come back. What are you... Come back here. Go ahead and play with your mother. What do I care? I'll just sit out.",
        "Josh: No, you don't have to do that. Because you and I can play as a team.",
        "Reva: Now that's a great idea. That's a great idea.",
        "Josh: It'll be fun.",
        "Marah: Okay.",
        "Tony: Okay.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Marah: Ready to go?",
        "Tony: Sure. Why not?",
        "Reva: I can't wait.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: What do you want?",
        "Eden: So you want to do the egg toss together?",
        "Bill: I didn't think you were into that kind of stuff.",
        "Eden: Well, I'm into expanding my horizons.",
        "Bill: Oh, really. How can I say no? You might have a little bit of... Let me have a little bit of this first. (Rick blows whistle)",
        "Rick: Thank you. Can I have your attention please? Everybody please come here. I have the most unbelievable news. The fun is not going to stop. Josh and Reva have just agreed to do the egg toss! (Cheers and applause) The egg toss... The egg toss hasn't been cancelled. Thank you. Thank you. I mean that. Reva, look at me. I'm talking to you. All right, let's all line up please. Teammates please line up.",
        "Gus: Will there be enough eggs now?",
        "Rick: There's plenty of eggs.",
        "Marina: No fastballs. Or should I say fast eggs? (Whistle blows)",
        "Rick: Stop the fraternizing.",
        "Frank: All right, only 24 hours in a day. Let's move it. No flirting, Frank. Let's go. (Laughter) All right. All partners face each other one step apart. When I say toss the egg, you toss the egg. Do not move your legs, do not hand of the egg. If you drop the egg, you're immediately disqualified. All remaining teams will take an additional step... (Screams) Nice. All remaining teams will take an additional step backwards and we continue until the last team remains.",
        "Gus: I don't think anyone remains.",
        "Rick: Is that clear? I can't hear you!",
        "Everyone: Yes!",
        "Rick: Buzz.",
        "Buzz: Yes.",
        "Rick: Throw it, baby. Let the Bauer Olympics begin! (Applause)",
        "Cassie: Did you say egg toss?",
        "Rick: I sure did. Are you in?",
        "Edmund: Well, I managed to survive my first egg toss.",
        "Cassie: And your first Bauer barbecue.",
        "Edmund: Careful, the day is yet young.",
        "Cassie: (Laughs) You're a funny guy.",
        "Edmund: Is that a good thing?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, it's a good thing. Most people don't know that about you. Now that you're starting to loosen up a bit, they'll see.",
        "Edmund: I'm sorry, what?",
        "Cassie: What do you mean, \"what\"?",
        "Edmund: You think I'm uptight? (Laughs) Cassie, that is very rich coming from you.",
        "Cassie: You think I'm uptight? I am the poster child for laid-back.",
        "Edmund: No, no, no. That was the old Cassie. You see, the new Cassie over- schedules herself madly.",
        "Cassie: I do not.",
        "Edmund: No?",
        "Cassie: No.",
        "Edmund: Oh. I don't suppose you brought your day planner with you?",
        "Cassie: In my purse. Why?",
        "Edmund: May I see it, please?",
        "Cassie: I guess.",
        "Edmund: Thank you very much. You know, I could ask you why you even bothered bringing it to a casual family function, but I don't think we'll go there. Thank you.",
        "Cassie: Give me my purse. That's private.",
        "Edmund: Just a moment, please. Let's see, what do we have? Yes, here it is, exhibit A: Every 15-minute block of the day scheduled, including your morning coffee. Oh, your second cup of coffee, a shower. What do you have for today's events? Ah, yes, here we are: Mandatory have fun.",
        "Cassie: I have fun. I was having fun until you started driving me nuts with this.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, Cassie, as beautiful as you are, you're the one who needs to loosen up around here. (Guests chattering)",
        "Mel: So Jeffrey had nothing else to do today, so I said the more the merrier.",
        "Rick: Sure, by all means. You know, as long as we don't talk about the Garden of Eden murders. And sweetheart, I definitely don't want to hear the words \"autopsy\" and \"murder weapon.\"",
        "Jeffrey: Actually, that's two words, Bauer, just like tox screen-- which, by the way, I was going over victim number four's, and I noticed something really strange. I'm just kidding. Just kidding.",
        "Mel: You know what? Why don't we get you a burger, okay?",
        "Reva: Did I hear you right? You want to give Marah our blessing?",
        "Josh: No, I'm not saying that I want to, Reva. I still think she's too young, and I'm not sure that Tony's the right guy for her. But if she's determined, if they're determined to do this, if they're going to do it, how can we possibly stop them? And if we push too hard, we'll just alienate Marah.",
        "Reva: So then...",
        "Josh: Look, think about how angry you've gotten at me because you think I'm trying to control Shayne's life. Now, how is this situation any different?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Shayne really does care about you. Sorry, I wouldn't be surprised if he just said no to the whole thing and stayed right here.",
        "Marina: He better not. Pitching for the majors is Shayne's dream. If he gave that up for me, I'd never forgive myself.",
        "Lizzie: I hear you. (Guests chattering) Hey, Ben, it's Lizzie. Listen, you need to call me back as soon as you get this...",
        "Beth: What on earth are you doing talking to Ben Reade? He's a prime suspect in a murder investigation.",
        "Lizzie: Mom, he didn't do that. He didn't kill anyone.",
        "Beth: Oh, okay. Then he's a male hustler. Is that much better?",
        "Lizzie: No! Okay, yes, he does need some help, and that's why I was talking to him, Mom. I was just trying to help him out. I told him he should go to Felicia. I told him how much she helped me.",
        "Beth: Then let Holly or one of Ben's friends convince him. You stay out of it.",
        "Lizzie: Okay.",
        "Beth: Promise me that you will not see or talk to Ben Reade again.",
        "Lizzie: I promise. Bye, Mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: You were great at the egg toss.",
        "Eden: So you and Frank are the egg toss champions. So what other games have you guys been up to?",
        "Darci: Get away from me. I told Frank I don't know you, and if he finds out otherwise... I just don't want him to find out about my old life, okay?",
        "Eden: Well, so it sounds like you really fell for the guy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You think I'm uptight?",
        "Edmund: A bit too regimented perhaps.",
        "Cassie: Uptight? The other day Jeffrey O'Neill said that I was harsh, and that I didn't know how to have fun.",
        "Edmund: Well, Jeffrey O'Neill's an idiot.",
        "Cassie: Yes, he's an idiot, but sometimes idiots are right. I didn't used to be like this, you know? (Sighs) It's been since...",
        "Edmund: Since Richard died.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I just... I just felt like if I kept myself busy that I wouldn't feel his absence so much.",
        "Edmund: Do you still feel that way?",
        "Cassie: No.",
        "Edmund: Why?",
        "Cassie: Because I don't feel empty anymore, and I have things to look forward to-- things, people that make me happy.",
        "Edmund: Well, then perhaps you should wean yourself of this. Get rid of the lists. Get rid of the schedules. Let life just happen again, because if you do, you just might end up someplace interesting.",
        "Cassie: If I do... Will you come along for the ride?",
        "Edmund: I will be there every step of the way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shayne: All right, I got the plan. Here's what we do. We cut out early, take a ride in your convertible, okay? We'll come back for the fireworks, and then we'll stay up all night and watch the sun rise, just the two of us. What do you think?",
        "Marina: Sunrise?",
        "Shayne: Yeah.",
        "Marina: Don't you have all-star practice tomorrow?",
        "Shayne: So what? I mean, how much time do we have left to spend with each other? I can miss one practice...",
        "Marina: Shayne, no, you can't.",
        "Shayne: Yes, I...",
        "Marina: Look, anyway, I have a really early morning tomorrow, okay, so a late night is out.",
        "Shayne: Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Darci: Look, I know I started this relationship with Frank for the wrong reason, but I really like him now. Please don't screw this up for me, Eden. If he ever finds out I...",
        "Frank: Darci, I thought you ladies didn't know each other.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tony: Ed.",
        "Ed: Yeah?",
        "Tony: Have you heard anything from Danny and Michelle?",
        "Ed: No, and I thought they'd at least be back in time for dessert, especially since I left a whole bag of cookies and stuff-- which reminds me, I've got to set it out.",
        "Tony: This is so not good. If they don't show up, Marah, that means I have to cancel the most important part of the surprise.",
        "Josh: Marah, Tony, there's something very important we'd like to say to you.",
        "Reva: We know what you've been up to, the big surprise.",
        "Marah: The big what?",
        "Josh: Yeah, and I'd be less than honest if I said that I was completely thrilled. I mean, your mother and I would prefer it if you'd wait another five or ten or, you know, 20 or 30 years. That would be nice.",
        "Reva: But if this is what you want, I mean, we're not going to stand in your way, honey. Marah, you have our blessing. Tony, welcome to the family.",
        "Josh: I just...",
        "Tony: Um...",
        "Josh: I just hope you'll let me walk you down the aisle.",
        "Marah: Walk me down the aisle?",
        "Josh: Yes.",
        "Marah: Wait, you guys think that...",
        "Tony: You think that we're getting married?",
        "Marah: (Laughs)",
        "Reva: Well, aren't you?",
        "Tony and Marah: No!",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Reva: Well, what about the... the bride and the groom for the top of the cake and the flowers you smuggled in?",
        "Josh: The Uncle Sam guy, who's a justice of the peace? He said he was doing a surprise wedding.",
        "Marah: A surprise wedding for Danny and Michelle, not for us.",
        "Tony: No.",
        "Reva: (Laughs)",
        "Ed: You guys were asking about Danny and Michelle earlier.",
        "Marah: Yeah.",
        "Ed: They left this note in the kitchen. They're on some mysterious errand out of town, and they're not going to be back until really late tonight.",
        "Tony: Great, great. There goes our foolproof plan.",
        "Marah: I guess we won't have a surprise wedding for Danny and Michelle after all. (Music playing)",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Ed: A surprise wedding at the barbecue? That's never happened before.",
        "Pastor: Welcome to shady tree wedding chapel.",
        "Michelle: Thank you.",
        "Eden: You need to come up with some evidence to take the pressure off, unless you think that I'm the killer."
