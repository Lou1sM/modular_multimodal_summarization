        "Cassie: And now look at us on the same page, sitting here making out and ordering the same food.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, we're even on the same page about your assumed-to-be ex. Now he needs to get out of the picture and leave you alone.",
        "Cassie: Yep, that's going to happen. It is, because Dinah is going to come through for us. She is. She's going to go to the police. She's going to tell them that he kidnapped her. They're going to arrest Edmund. He is going to be out of my baby's life and out of our lives.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, then things are looking up.",
        "Cassie: Don't jinx us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Now come on. What's it going to be? Am I going to turn you in and ruin your shot of being Daddy of the Year, or are you going to go ahead and jump in the bed with me and get rid of this yuckiness.",
        "Edmund: I never kidnapped you. It'll be your word against mine.",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs ) Okay, well, one liar against another liar. I don't know, I think that they're going to believe the pregnant liar.",
        "Edmund: A pregnant liar with a history of mental instability who was once a fugitive from the law on murder charges.",
        "Dinah: Where are you going?",
        "Edmund: To take a deep breath to keep from strangling you.",
        "Dinah: You'll be back. I know you will. Oh, you know what? We won't be needing you much longer. Before we know it, I'll be carrying Edmund's baby for real.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: (To Marissa) You never stood a chance, mom.",
        "Tammy: Hey. I'll have... never mind. I'll sit at a table.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy? Who died?",
        "Tammy: Not now. I'm not in the mood.",
        "Jonathan: Where's your boyfriend? Don't tell me you and Sandy got into a fight? Oh, about what?",
        "Sandy: You still want him? Every time you two are in a room together, I see it.",
        "Jonathan: Come on, spill it, Cuz. Don't tell me you caught Sandy with another girl?",
        "Tammy: Sandy did do something to hurt me, okay? But it's my fault. Because I hurt him just as bad.",
        "Jonathan: How?",
        "Tammy: It doesn't matter. You just shouldn't hurt the people you love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: So, why don't you go inside and grab a table and I'll be in a minute. He's gone. Well, was I right?",
        "Olivia: That's Alfred. That's Jonathan's adoptive father.",
        "Reva: Oh, my God.",
        "Olivia: How long has he been here, Reva?",
        "Reva: A long time.",
        "Olivia: Doing what?",
        "Reva: I don't know.",
        "Olivia: He was your boss?",
        "Reva: Just doesn't make sense. I mean, Jonathan...",
        "Olivia: What about Jonathan?",
        "Reva: All this time I thought that Nate was...",
        "Olivia: No, no. There is no Nate.",
        "Reva: Okay, not Nate. He's Alfred, the man who has been beating on my kid.",
        "Olivia: And he probably killed my sister.",
        "Reva: I want him to suffer.",

        "Jonathan: Hey, what did Sandy do to you?",
        "Tammy: None of your business.",
        "Jonathan: Well, let me tell you something. If you told him off as good as you told me off in the barn the other day, you're rid of that dude for good.",
        "Tammy: I wish I could say the same about you.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Well, you're better off without Sandy, because he's nothing.",
        "Tammy: What is it with you, J.B.? Why are you so cruel? I don't want to hear that I'm mean because I was abused garbage anymore, because I don't buy it. I think you get some kind of a sick thrill out of hurting people.",
        "Zo\u00eb: Sandy. Hi, Honey. Did you miss me?",
        "Tammy: Sandy?",
        "Jonathan: Do I know you?",
        "Zo\u00eb: Don't tell me you haven't told her. Sandy's with me now, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: I have news for you. This isn't Sandy.",
        "Zo\u00eb: That's not what he said when I was in his bed.",
        "Tammy: Meet Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Scram, Zo\u00eb. Get out of here. I said, beat it.",
        "Tammy: He used you to hurt me.",
        "Zo\u00eb: You lying jerk.",
        "Tammy: That's the girl I thought Sandy was with. You set this whole thing up, didn't you? You made me think that Sandy's cheating on me.",
        "Jonathan: I didn't make you think anything. You thought it because you wanted to think it.",
        "Tammy: You are such A...",
        "Jonathan: What?",
        "Tammy: You couldn't find another target this time, huh? What did I ever do to you?",
        "Jonathan: Nothing. You've done nothing.",
        "Tammy: Then why, Jonathan? Why? Why is it so hard for you to see other people happy? Or is it just that you can't stand to see me being with anybody else?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I have something to ask you.",
        "Jeffrey: What? ( Phone rings )",
        "Cassie: Oh.",
        "Jeffrey: Who is it?",
        "Cassie: It's Edmund. He can leave a message. Okay.",
        "Jeffrey: What?",
        "Cassie: Here.",
        "Jeffrey: What's that?",
        "Cassie: Okay, like, all of the parents get together throughout the summer and they throw parties for the kids. And now it's my turn to throw a party. And I know kids' thing is not really your scene, but I thought just maybe that you would... bad idea. I'll just take it back.",
        "Jeffrey: What, what... did I say that?",
        "Cassie: No, but your face said that.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, then you don't know my face very well at all, because RJ happens to be one of my bestest friends in the whole world, and as matter of fact, he liked me before you did. So I would be very honored to come to his party.",
        "Cassie: You would?",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, I would. And since we're dispensing invitations. One for you.",
        "Cassie: This is a grown-up party.",
        "Jeffrey: Hm. It's, you know, a political thing. It's good for my career and all that. They're even giving out awards. And what do you know, one of them is for me.",
        "Cassie: Really?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. It's black tie. But the chow apparently will be very good, and there will be dinner and...",
        "Cassie: I would love to go to this dinner with you. But, Jeffrey, it's the same night as RJ's party.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Hey. Calmer now? You know, I didn't realize that this was going to be such a struggle for you. You know, get laid, go to jail. Tough one. I know.",
        "Edmund: Okay. Far be it for me to turn down sex with a beautiful woman.",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs ) Okay, well, I'm also the mother of your child. Let's not forget that.",
        "Edmund: No, the woman who's carrying my child. Let's go. I'll go for it. Why not? Just don't be under any illusions, Dinah. Every second I'm with you I'll be thinking about Cassie.",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs ) Oh. No. No, you won't.",
        "Edmund: Oh.",
        "Dinah: Mm-mm. ( Knock at the door ) Come in.",
        "Bill: Is this a bad time?",
        "Edmund: No. Couldn't be better, actually. Think about what I said, Dinah. Bill.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: How'd you figure it out?",
        "Reva: I don't know. It was just something.",
        "Olivia: Well, good for you. I'm calling the cops.",
        "Reva: No, Olivia. You can't. We have no proof. We have no evidence that he's committed any crimes, and then he's going to escape and we've lost the element of surprise.",
        "Olivia: What do you suggest? You're going to go on some vigilante mission on your own?",
        "Reva: You know what? I have to find a way to keep him away from my son.",
        "Olivia: Reva, come on. What makes you think that he won't hurt you, too?",
        "Reva: Wow, all of this concern about my personal safety now. I'm touched.",
        "Olivia: I didn't help my sister. She was in trouble. I didn't... I didn't help her. I didn't help Jonathan. I'm just not going to make the same mistake with you.",
        "Reva: Olivia, if we call the police, it's going to spook Nate, and we'll never know why he was here or why he's all of sudden latched on to me.",
        "Olivia: ( Laughs ) I love how you make everything about you. My sister is dead. And he's the one who probably killed her. Now, I'm calling...",
        "Nate: Reva? You're off the phone, good. Come inside so we can order.",
        "Reva: You know that call I made, I have to go and do something.",
        "Nate: Right now?",
        "Reva: Yeah. I know. I'm sorry. Rain check?",
        "Nate: All right. I suppose it's for the best. I should be getting back to the bar. We're short-staffed now that I've lost my favorite bartender.",
        "Reva: Oh, well, you know flattery will get you nowhere, buddy.",
        "Nate: ( Laughs ) we'll see about that.",
        "Olivia: Oh, my goodness. It's all making sense to me now. I see why you want to handle this on your own, why you're taking is so personally. But I'm sorry. Either you turn your boyfriend in, or I will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Little brother in the house.",
        "Bill: Yes.",
        "Dinah: It's good to see you.",
        "Bill: Dinah, why was Edmund here? Okay, this guy just tried to kidnap you. Why would you let him in?",
        "Dinah: He's the father of my child, okay? He wanted to talk to me about something.",
        "Bill: What does he have to talk to you about?",
        "Dinah: It's nothing.",
        "Bill: Okay.",
        "Dinah: Okay?",
        "Bill: All right.",
        "Dinah: He's gone. Now you're here. Excellent. So is it official?",
        "Bill: Is what...?",
        "Dinah: Did you adopt Emma.",
        "Bill: Yes, you are an aunt.",
        "Dinah: ( Cheers )",
        "Bill: And I am a dad. My goodness, yes.",
        "Dinah: Hey. I'm happy for you.",
        "Bill: Well, thank you very much.",
        "Dinah: LB, my gosh, you have found yourself a wife, you've got a child, you're married. When did this all happen?",
        "Bill: I have no idea, but it feels pretty damn good, I've got to tell you.",
        "Dinah: I bet it does.",
        "Bill: But listen to me. Speaking of family, I have to ask you something. Please, please sit. How would my favorite sister like to do me a favor?",
        "Dinah: Oh, okay. Well, I'm going to call Mindy.",
        "Bill: Well, I'm talking about you, so don't you move, all right? Now, are you up for it or what?",
        "Dinah: Well, depends.",
        "Bill: All right. Well, you heard about Olivia's sister Marissa, right?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Yeah. Which is awful. What, did she drown?",
        "Bill: Well, yes. And Olivia is a mess.",
        "Dinah: I can only imagine.",
        "Bill: My goal right now is to put a smile on Olivia's face, and I'm pulling out all the stops. Now, I have this idea of having a family photo session. This is something that I won and I haven't used it and I just feel like I have to surprise...",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs )",
        "Bill: Don't laugh, because I want to surprise Olivia with this. And I need this to work.",
        "Dinah: Aw. That's very sweet. You know what? I think she's going to love it.",
        "Bill: You think so?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Yeah, okay. How can I help?",
        "Bill: Well, I want you to be a part of it.",
        "Dinah: You want me to be in the photo?",
        "Bill: Yes. It's a family photo and you are family, so I want you there.",
        "Dinah: With Emma and Olivia?",
        "Bill: Yes.",
        "Dinah: Look, Bill...",
        "Bill: Dinah, please.",
        "Dinah: Bill, Hi.",
        "Bill: What?",
        "Dinah: Dinah Marler? I'm a reject of Springfield. I think that it would be bad luck for me to be in the photo.",
        "Bill: Okay, see what you're doing right there? I don't want to hear that, this pity thing, okay? Because you are my sister, and I love you, and I am proud of you.",
        "Dinah: Well, don't be.",
        "Bill: Well, I am.",
        "Dinah: I mean, don't be, Bill, because I do not deserve it, okay? I am a liar, and I'm a fraud.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Jeffrey, I really want to go to this dinner with you, but it's...",
        "Jeffrey: It's okay, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: I don't know how to change RJ's party.",
        "Jeffrey: No, it's fine.",
        "Cassie: Five different parents got together, and we all came up with this date.",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Two other set of parents changed their whole vacation for the summer just so they could come to the party.",
        "Jeffrey: Really, it's okay. I didn't want to wear the penguin suit, anyway.",
        "Cassie: Wear the penguin... no, wait. No. No, no, no.",
        "Jeffrey: No, what?",
        "Cassie: You can't not go to your dinner because of some silly kid party.",
        "Jeffrey: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. First of all, it's not silly, and secondly, I don't remember asking your permission.",
        "Cassie: You're getting an award.",
        "Jeffrey: So one of my associates can accept it for me. They can say that I had a family obligation or something.",
        "Cassie: Wow.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. I mean... I didn't mean...",
        "Cassie: No. No, no.",
        "Jeffrey: Because I'm not...",
        "Cassie: No, no. We're not your family, and I know how important your work is to you.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, RJ is important to me, too. It's... I mean, his social development is important to me, too. I mean, shouldn't he have a male presence there? That's all I'm saying.",
        "Cassie: You mean like a father figure.",
        "Jeffrey: Look, just... uh... there's going to be a bunch of moms there, right? I mean, they're going to play games, aren't they?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, so?",
        "Jeffrey: So boys should be with boys and the...",
        "Cassie: There will be other parties.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, yeah? When?",
        "Cassie: Okay, let's compromise. Why don't you come over to my place afterwards and you can have cake and ice cream with me and RJ, and we will give you a blow-by-blow description of every single thing that happened at the party.",
        "Jeffrey: Are you sure?",
        "Cassie: I'm sure.",
        "Jeffrey: I mean, because, you know, I could... you know.",
        "Cassie: I said I was sure! ( Laughs )",
        "Edmund: Anything I can do to help?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: I want to be with you as little or as much as you want to be with me.",
        "Tammy: What does that mean?",
        "Jonathan: It means you don't want to be with me, and I don't want to be with you. Right?",
        "Tammy: Don't look at me like that.",
        "Jonathan: Hey. I tried to walk away.",
        "Tammy: Then why do you keep doing everything in your power to break me and Sandy up?",
        "Sandy: Tammy? Is everything okay here?",
        "Tammy: Sandy. I'm so sorry. I accused you of being with that girl, and I should have believed you.",
        "Sandy: You believe me now?",
        "Tammy: It was Jonathan. He set the whole thing up. He pretended to be you and he took the girl to your place and he made sure that I found out about it.",
        "Sandy: What?",
        "Jonathan: You borrowed my life for a while, Sandy, so I took yours.",
        "Tammy: No, Sandy, don't. He is so not worth it. Just forget about him, okay? We can just forget about this whole stupid thing. Pretend it never happened.",
        "Sandy: But it did happen, Tammy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Nate was my boss.",
        "Olivia: I think it was more than that.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, why does it matter?",
        "Olivia: Why does it matter? Your cozying up to the same sick animal that probably killed my sister and hurt your son.",
        "Reva: Okay! What happened... the truth...",
        "Olivia: What is the truth with you?",
        "Reva: The truth is that Nate came along at a time... well, he was very charming, okay? And we got along.",
        "Olivia: Oh, my God. He came on to you and you fell for it.",
        "Reva: I was... I was vulnerable, okay? Or needy, I don't know. Stupid. But he was there.",
        "Olivia: Did you two actually...",
        "Reva: No. Nothing happened between us. But he paid attention to me. He was interesting and he was funny and he made me feel beautiful when I needed it. But I was just stupid enough to believe that maybe he was... you know...",
        "Olivia: He did the same thing with my sister in the beginning. He was very sweet. I remember watching them at their wedding, exchanging their vows, and my sister was glowing. She had never looked so happy. And we thought he was such a catch. Reva, does Jonathan know that he's here?",
        "Reva: Yeah. He has for a long time.",
        "Olivia: He didn't tell you about it?",
        "Reva: No. But then we've been at odds with each other. But I can't believe that if Nate wanted to hurt me, that Jonathan would be protecting him.",
        "Olivia: Are you really sure about that? Jonathan has been covering for Alfred for a very, very long time. Jonathan could know that Alfred killed Marissa.",
        "Reva: No. I don't believe that.",
        "Olivia: All right. Well, this is making sense. When Jonathan was little, Alfred would walk into the room, and I just thought it was a healthy dose of respect. Jonathan was showing him that he was afraid of him.",
        "Reva: You know, he was just starting to get his act together here until Alfred showed up. But now, you know, he's back to square one. He's angry and he's hurt and he's lashing out. I can't... I can't let him near my son, this guy, until I do what has to be done.",
        "Olivia: And what is that?",
        "Reva: Get my son and your sister the justice they deserve.",
        "Olivia: Okay, I know what he's capable of.",
        "Reva: Then help me figure out some way we can nail this guy, because that's the only way we're going to be able to get the bastard! Just help me!",
        "Olivia: All right. ? Don't make me regret trusting you. This has to be between us, okay?",
        "Olivia: Okay.",
        "Reva: Thanks. I'll be in touch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Dinah, you've done some stuff, okay? Who hasn't. But that is all behind you now. You have changed. You are a different person now.",
        "Dinah: People don't change, Bill.",
        "Bill: Yes, people do. They can. The smart ones can. And you're one of the smart ones.",
        "Dinah: You know what? I'm smart. I know I'm smart, you know? I get several things but the one thing I can't get is love and the whole feelings thing. I'm not good...",
        "Bill: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. Is that... come over here. Come to my office again. Where is all this coming from? Huh? You have changed. You have and that little bambino that you're carrying right there, that is living proof. Now, I have no idea why you did it, but I can tell you this, it's going to make Cassie and Edmund very happy. That's going to make you happy, it will. Because that's what children do. They connect us. They make us better than we were before. That's what that's going to do.",
        "Dinah: You're right. Babies connect people, don't they?",
        "Bill: Hey, I know that you wanted to be a mom for a long time. I know that. And listen to me. Listen to me. That is going to happen. You are going to find someone who is good and who loves you for who you are. You got that?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, man, that's what I want. You know that's always what I wanted.",
        "Bill: Well, guess what? It's going to happen. It is going to happen, it will. But listen to me: You have to do something for me right now and get your butt cleaned up because we have a photo session to get to. Come on.",
        "Dinah: Bill, I can't. No, I'm not going to go.",
        "Bill: Yes.",
        "Dinah: No, I'm not going to go.",
        "Bill: Yes. Yes, please.",
        "Dinah: It's so sweet of you to ask me, it really is, but you know, if it was Mom and Billy, then it would maybe make sense for me to go, but I'm not going to do this.",
        "Bill: I want you there.",
        "Dinah: This time around, it should be you and Olivia.",
        "Bill: Dinah, I want you there.",
        "Dinah: No. No. Now, go. You go on and you give yourself some time to change this tie that you have on, and th",

        "Edmund: You two seem to be having a scheduling dilemma.",
        "Cassie: Um, no. We're...",
        "Jeffrey: We've got it all worked out, Edmund. Thanks.",
        "Edmund: But it's not the ideal solution, now, is it? Let's see. Cassie, you'd like to go to the awards ceremony with Jeffrey, help him celebrate his big honor, now, wouldn't you?",
        "Cassie: You were eavesdropping.",
        "Edmund: You should go, Cassie. Have fun. I can supervise RJ's party for you, if you'd like. I wouldn't mind at all. In fact, I'd enjoy it.",
        "Cassie: You're not invited, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: So invite me.",
        "Cassie: Thank you, but no.",
        "Edmund: Ah. Right. Don't know why I bothered.",
        "Jeffrey: What was that all about?",
        "Cassie: I don't know but I'm going to find out.",
        "Jeffrey: Down, down, down, girl. Don't bite. That's what he wants.",
        "Cassie: What the hell was that? You are so smug, do you know that?",
        "Edmund: Smug?",
        "Cassie: Yes, smug. Because you think you're going to be able to keep the baby from me now.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, how does my offering to bail you out of a scheduling conflict have anything to do with the baby? I was trying to do you a favor. Let's face it, Jeffrey O'Neil is hardly the domestic type.",
        "Cassie: You don't know anything about Jeffrey O'Neil.",
        "Edmund: I wasn't criticizing him, Cassie. I wasn't criticizing him. I'm sure Mr. O'Neil will do his very best to be the kind of man you need in your life. I just don't think he's up to the task. I don't think he has it in him. He's incapable of commitment, Cassie. And not just with you but with any woman. And he has a history to prove it. So I think while you're counting my past against me, maybe you should give a long, hard look at Jeffrey O'Neil's, too.",

        "Tammy: What happened was that Jonathan purposely tried to break us up. We can't let him do that, because if we do, then he wins.",
        "Sandy: You see? Right there, that's the problem. If we break up, it's because Jonathan won. If we stay together, we beat Jonathan. In your mind, everything is about Jonathan and that's what's between us. That's the real issue.",
        "Tammy: No, but I told you, I don't care about him.",
        "Sandy: You don't think you do.",
        "Tammy: And? What? No matter how much I deny it, you're still not going to believe me? Sandy? What's happening here? Are you walking away from me?",
        "Nate: Your shiner's healing up nicely. ( Laughs ) Come on, son. You practically accused me of murdering your mother. I couldn't let that go, could I? ( Laughs ) Pals again?",
        "Tammy: Sandy, you can't mean that. You can't let Jonathan come between us.",
        "Sandy: I'm not dumping you, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: You're not?",
        "Sandy: I just think we should take a break.",
        "Tammy: That is the same thing and you know it. You're just trying to let me down easy.",
        "Sandy: I'm sorry, I don't know what else to say, here. Tammy, I still care about you, but what kind of future can we have if you doubt me so easily.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan did everything he possibly could to put those doubts in my mind.",
        "Sandy: And he succeeded in putting doubts in mine.",
        "Nate: You know, I would deem it disrespectful for you not to shake your father's hand. Do you not hear me?",
        "Sandy: That's it.",
        "Tammy: Sandy! Stop it!",
        "Jonathan: Tammy!",
        "Tammy: Stop it!",

        "Jeffrey: What did you say to Cassie?",
        "Edmund: Why are you so concerned, Mr. O'Neil? Does Cassie seem upset to you? Or does she just seem quiet? Because that's the way she gets when she's thinking.",
        "Jeffrey: Thinking about what?",
        "Edmund: Maybe about the offer I made to her about her child did I do something? Did I do something wrong?",
        "Edmund: All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: All right. You go to Cassie and tell her I never kidnapped you.",
        "Dinah: Okay, so once I hold up my end of the deal, how do I know you're going to hold up yours, so to speak?",
        "Edmund: Because when your end's up, mine just won't stay down.",
        "Edmund: Deal?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Deal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: Enough! Come on.",
        "Reva: Stop it! Stop!",
        "Jonathan: He started it.",
        "Sandy: He started it.",
        "Reva: I don't care who started it. Just walk away. Now!",
        "Jonathan: Nobody lays a hand on me!",
        "Reva: Stop it!",
        "Jonathan: Nobody!",
        "Reva: Tammy! Tammy, please.",
        "Tammy: Sandy, come on.",
        "Reva: Go, now. Go. Please. Don't. Are you all right? What happened?",
        "Jonathan: I know you're not going to believe me, but he started it.",
        "Reva: All I care about is that you're all right. You're going to have bruises on top of bruises.",
        "Jonathan: Don't baby me. I'm going to be fine.",
        "Reva: But...",
        "Jonathan: Stay away.",
        "Nate: That's... that's his second bar fight. The poor kid doesn't know when to stop.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, you know what? I think I forgot my invitation to my party on the table.",
        "Cassie: No, you put it in your pocket. I saw you.",
        "Jeffrey: No, this is the invitation to RJ's party.",
        "Cassie: Oh. And I have yours. Well, you can keep...",
        "Jeffrey: Here. Take mine.",
        "Cassie: So, are we on the same page again?",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie, you know, I really don't want all this",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Okay. Perfect time of the month. Good, good, good. Before long, Edmund will not know what hit him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Is it my tie? Is that what...",
        "Olivia: No, it's a lovely tie. I just love you.",
        "Bill: I love you. I love you so much. But I need something from you, and that's a smile, honey. Do you think you can do that? Because these photographers, that's what they want in pictures, for some reason, is a smile. So can you smile and say cheese? Hm?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: My son is so messed up. I don't know what to do. Well, you know, never mind. That's a rhetorical question. I need a drink.",
        "Nate: Well, you look good behind that bar. ( Laughter )",
        "Reva: Yeah, baby. Oh, yeah. I do, don't I? It feels good, too. It feels like this is where I belong. I never should have left.",
        "Nate: Now, Reva, don't you tease. You're dangling a juicy steak in front of a starving man.",
        "Reva: I'm not teasing. So what do you say? I want my job back. If you'll have me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: I'll do it.",
        "Tammy: Sandy, don't be like that. Come on, you just told me that you still care about me.",
        "Sandy: I do. But I can't be with you, Tammy. Not like this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: You're serious about this?",
        "Reva: Completely.",
        "Nate: You know, this isn't going to sit well with Josh.",
        "Reva: He'll understand. Joshua wants me to be happy, and he knows this job makes me happy. And now that we have the ground rules clear, what's the harm?",
        "Nate: None. I'm just surprised. You were so determined to steer clear of this place, and me. What changed your mind?",
        "Reva: Well, let's just say I have a new perspective. So, is the job still mine?",
        "Nate: All I can say is, welcome back, Reva. _Next, on \"Guiding Light.\" _",
        "Lizzie: I'm spending my first night alone with you. I wouldn't miss that for anything. Oh, yeah.",
        "Mel: They're going to want to know how to find Harley.",

        "Mallet: You can't go see Gus.",
