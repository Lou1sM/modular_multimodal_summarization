        "Jonathan: Let's get this straight, old man. You and your flunkies are not going to run me out of town. Foreclosure notices? Cancelled credit cards? Think that's enough to rattle my cage? Do you?",
        "Alan: Is that all you've got to say to me? It's a pity. I guess I've wasted a trip.",
        "Jonathan: I'm not done with you.",
        "Alan: Let me make one thing very clear to you, Mr. Randall. This war between us was started when you did not accept my offer. But I assure you, I will be the one that finishes it.",
        "Jonathan: Maybe I'm just stupid. You don't scare me.",
        "Alan: You're not smart. Because if you were, you would realize I don't waste my time scaring people.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Hope that's a dirty magazine you're looking at, not my insides.",
        "Colin: You should be resting, huh? Surgery, group therapy, not to mention a little spin around the racetrack.",
        "Reva: New experiences are exhilarating. You should learn from the good example I set.",
        "Colin: Yeah, I can't imagine you really want to set a good example. Now, uh... go get better, I'm busy, huh.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) You're so boring.",
        "Mandy: I have those slides, Dr. McCabe.",
        "Colin: Oh, uh, good. Just set it down right there. Thanks.",
        "Reva: I don't know about you, but I am starving.",
        "Colin: Well, I'll have someone send a tray of food to your room...",
        "Reva: No, I want to go out.",
        "Colin: Okay, well, I'll sign of on a...",
        "Reva: No, I want to go out with you. I'm not taking no for an answer. You owe me a couple, anyway.",
        "Colin: Excuse me?",
        "Reva: Okay, maybe you don't. But I just... I want to share something with you.",
        "Colin: Now what?",
        "Reva: You know how to keep me alive, and I know how to live.",

        "Col. Briggs: Joshua Lewis.",
        "Josh: Yes.",
        "Col. Briggs: Colonel David Briggs. I flew in from Washington. Uh, Wanda told me how and where to find you.",
        "Josh: Oh, uh... I'm sorry, I didn't realize that we had an appointment today. Maybe we should go back to my office, I have a model of the hospital there, we can...",
        "Col. Briggs: I'm not here about the hospital, Mr. Lewis. Although word on the street is that you're doing a bang-up job. No, I'm here to give you something. While going through our records, the army discovered that your father, H.B. Lewis, was awarded this medal from president John F. Kennedy. For some reason, the medal was never delivered, even though we have record of Mr. Lewis being awarded the honor.",
        "Josh: He... he mentioned this to me. But he said that he knew what he had done, and that's all that really mattered, so...",
        "Col. Briggs: He was an honorable man. And since you're doing so much work on behalf of the veterans with this hospital, the secretary of the army sends his deepest apologies for the oversight and asks that you accept this honor on behalf of a grateful nation.",
        "Josh: That's really something there, daddy. Reva's going to be... ( sighs ) Okay, uh, Billy's going to be really excited about this...",

        "Buzz: Ava, could you bus table two over there?",
        "Ava: ( Sighs ) Yeah.",
        "Buzz: Thanks.",
        "Ava: Be a heck of a lot easier than cleaning up all the other junk in my life.",
        "Buzz: Are we okay today?",
        "Ava: We?",
        "Buzz: You.",
        "Ava: No.",
        "Buzz: Well, you want to talk about it? I mean, I noticed you're upset. I can't pretend I didn't notice you're upset. We don't have a confessional here, but...",
        "Ava: You go first.",
        "Buzz: Me?",
        "Ava: Yeah, you're the one who stole the woman that your son's in love with.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Frank... what is it you think you know?",
        "Frank: Are we really going to play this game? Because there's no sense in lying. I know all about you and dad.",
        "Olivia: I don't know who told you about Buzz and me...",
        "Frank: See, I could just ask him, and he'll tell me the truth. Now talk.",
        "Olivia: Frank, I was hurt and angry. You told me you wanted to step back from our relationship.",
        "Frank: And then you just jumped in bed with him.",
        "Olivia: No! No! Who told you that?!",
        "Frank: I don't think it matters.",
        "Olivia: Frank, I didn't sleep with Buzz. Even if I was tempted, I wouldn't...",
        "Frank: You stopped yourself? You think you deserve a free pass now because of that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I can't believe you'd want to be my birth coach.",
        "Tammy: Why not?",
        "Lizzie: Because I'm having your boyfriend's baby?",
        "Tammy: Yeah. And that doesn't exactly make me happy. But I love Jonathan. It's his baby, and we're going to be connected anyway, so I figured, just do the adult thing, and...",
        "Lizzie: Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Do you know that you're the first person who has asked to help me just... just because? And you should be the one that hates me the most.",
        "Jonathan: What's going on?",
        "Lizzie: Um... Tammy's going to help me out.",
        "Jonathan: Really? Hey, what you said before, you were right. Lizzie and I need to talk about a few things.",
        "Tammy: That's great. Good, I'll leave you two alone. Lizzie, I'll call you.",
        "Lizzie: Thank you. ( Gasps )",
        "Jonathan: If you and your family come after Tammy, things are not going to work out too good for you and the little one. You got it?",
        "Lizzie: Let go of me! You're hurting me! The baby!",
        "Jonathan: The baby is fine, and so are you, for the moment.",
        "Lizzie: What the hell is wrong with you?",
        "Jonathan: Your grandfather is trying to take away everything that means anything to me. Look at me, he's already got my bar, my money. But all he's really done is gotten my attention.",
        "Lizzie: What do you want me to do?",
        "Jonathan: I want you... I want you to understand that I do not scare off. Someone comes at me, I come back twice as hard.",
        "Lizzie: Nobody asked you to do this. Nobody asked you to get involved!",
        "Jonathan: I am involved! Alan is going to wish...",
        "Lizzie: Stop! Stop it! Stop it, stop it! I am so sick of this tug of war! Do you want this baby, Jonathan?",
        "Jonathan: What?",
        "Lizzie: Do you want to fight for this baby? Because if you do, that is fine. Take it! Take the birth charts, take the sonograms, you know what, why don't you take the bills... you can step up and be my birth partner! If you really want me to, I'll take you to the next OB appointment, you can hold my hands and you can tell me some stories...",
        "Jonathan: All right. Enough.",
        "Lizzie: No! It's not enough! I hate this! Everybody hates this! It's really happening! It's really happening and everyone hates it, and that is sick! Jonathan, there is a life growing inside of me, and everybody hates it!",
        "Jonathan: Stop.",
        "Lizzie: No, then tell me that you don't hate it!",
        "Jonathan: I do hate it, but there's nothing we can do about that.",
        "Lizzie: Then let go of me, you jerk.",
        "Jonathan: You are not going to ruin my life!",
        "Lizzie: Let go of me!",
        "Jonathan: Wait, wait... wait...",
        "Lizzie: What?!",
        "Jonathan: It... shh! I think it moved. It moved.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I understand that! What I'm telling you is that I was... I am... all paid up through the semester. What do you mean it was rejected? Since when does the school reject payments from students in good standing? So you're telling me that my grades are good enough to get me qualified for the dean's list, but that's still not enough to get me invited back to school? Fine, fine! I will call them! This is crazy. No way. There's no way. This has got to stop.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Frank, you are the man that I want, okay? Buzz and I, we're just friends, that's it.",
        "Frank: Yeah, the guy that you always manage to run to.",
        "Olivia: Okay, so we're good friends.",
        "Frank: Look, I'll give you the weekend at the country inn when you guys slept together. But we've been talking lately about moving in together.",
        "Olivia: Frank, I was ready to move in with you. I was ready. And you put on the brakes.",
        "Frank: So this is my fault?",
        "Olivia: No, I'm not blaming you, I'm not saying that I even like the way I acted.",
        "Frank: But?",
        "Olivia: You want the truth?",
        "Frank: Yeah, that would be nice, actually.",
        "Olivia: The truth is I've had to sort out my feelings for you and Buzz. Okay, it's very complicated for me.",
        "Frank: Yeah, it's complicated all right.",
        "Olivia: I'm human. I've had thoughts... but Buzz and I both knew it would be wrong, Frank. And I'm here, standing right in front of you.",
        "Frank: Is that supposed to be enough?",
        "Olivia: It is for me.",
        "Frank: Until I hear something from someone else, right?",
        "Olivia: Hear what?! Who told you this?",
        "Frank: It doesn't matter.",
        "Olivia: It does matter! The only reason we're having this conversation is because somebody saw Buzz and me and jumped to the wrong conclusion! Who said this?",
        "Frank: I really don't think it matters.",
        "Olivia: It matters, Frank. Who would deliberately...? Oh. Oh, that lying, skinny, google-eyed bar wench!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Uh, uh, excuse me. That is none of your business.",
        "Ava: I know.",
        "Buzz: I don't know where you're getting your gossip from, but look elsewhere. Olivia and I did not, I repeat, did not spend last night together.",
        "Ava: Lying will only make things worse.",
        "Buzz: I... I'm not!",
        "Ava: Buzz!",
        "Buzz: What?!",
        "Ava: You gave me a job, a place to live. You've been like a hero to me. You are one of the most fantastic people I've ever met in my entire life. But when I saw you kissing her... and then the next day, I had to...",
        "Buzz: The next day? Kissing? I think we know what we're working with here. You just jumped to the wrong conclusion. We both came to our senses. Neither one of us wanted to hurt Frank.",
        "Ava: It's too late for that.",
        "Buzz: What do you mean, it's too late for that?",
        "Ava: He knows. Frank knows.",
        "Buzz: You told him?!",
        "Ava: But he pried it out of me, Buzz! I'm really bad at keeping secrets, anyways. I'm sorry. I told him, I'm sorry.",
        "Buzz: It's my fault, I messed up. You know what's worse?",
        "Ava: Don't tell me you still have a thing for her...",
        "Buzz: Okay, I won't.",
        "Ava: Oh, Buzz!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Reva's phone number in Minnesota. I should have memorized it when I had the chance. I didn't have a reason to, but now I have something... I want to share with her. Something wonderful, and I can't share it with my wife!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colin: Whoa, the whole thing, huh? You're actually, uh... actually pretty hungry I guess, huh?",
        "Reva: Sorry, Doc. Wrong girl.",
        "Colin: What?",
        "Mandy: Dr. McCabe, it was so nice of you to invite me to dinner.",
        "Reva: Call him Colin. I have to have my fun somehow. And, uh, be gentle on him. He doesn't do this often.",
        "Colin: Oh, well, take a seat, Candy, I, uh...",
        "Mandy: ( Laughs ) Mandy.",
        "Colin: Uh, Mandy. I'm sorry, of course, Mandy. Silly of me. Mandy. Wow. Goodness. Well, this is great, isn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Hi.",
        "Bartender: What's your poison?",
        "Reva: That would be chemo. But I'm looking to branch out a bit. What do you recommend? (Cell phone rings )",
        "Bartender: Going to get that?",
        "Reva: I'm working on it. I'm almost there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Oh, I... I didn't think you were going to be here. I was going to go over some things on the project, but I'll come back.",
        "Josh: No, wait. Stay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: ( Sighs ) Joshua. Hello?",
        "Bartender: Bad connection?",
        "Reva: Yeah. It happens.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: If this is a bad time for you, I really...",
        "Josh: Um, no, it's not, I was just, uh... I was trying to call Reva.",
        "Cassie: Oh? And, um... did you get a hold of her?",
        "Josh: Actually, I changed my mind.",
        "Cassie: About calling her?",
        "Josh: Yes. I'm glad you're here. I want to show you something.",

        "Colin: Oh, God.",
        "Mandy: ( Laughs )",
        "Colin: Oh, wow. All right, here it is, wait a second...",
        "Bartender: Friend of yours?",
        "Reva: Uh, he's like little baby bird out of the nest for the first time.",
        "Bartender: Eh, you look too good to be anyone's mama bird.",
        "Reva: I bet you say that to all the cancer patients. You'd better be careful. You are flirting with a bald- headed woman.",
        "Bartender: Hey, you've got the big C. Half our clientele has the same.",
        "Reva: Really?",
        "Bartender: Yeah. Close to the clinic.",
        "Reva: So, it's a turn-on to you? The big C?",
        "Bartender: No, courage is a big turn-on.",
        "Reva: Maybe they should put you on a poster. Encourage women to seek treatment.",
        "Bartender: Well, somehow I don't think cancer is your biggest problem.",

        "Olivia: Tell me it wasn't Ava. ( In high pitched voice ): \"Oh, golly, Frank! I feel just awful! I don't know what to do. I hate that you're the last to know.\"",
        "Frank: It wasn't like that.",
        "Olivia: It was her! She is lying about Buzz and me to score points with you, Frank!",
        "Frank: Don't blame Ava for what's wrong with us.",
        "Olivia: Whatever it is, let's just fix it.",
        "Frank: It's not that easy.",
        "Olivia: It is if we want it to be.",
        "Frank: I need some time, now, okay? I need some time to sort this all out.",
        "Olivia: Okay, all right. All right, I'm not going to push this. You do your thinking. You're going to figure out that we belong together.",
        "Frank: Maybe. Maybe not.",

        "Lizzie: Yeah.",
        "Jonathan: I mean, you felt it?",
        "Lizzie: I always feel it. It's definitely your kid in there. She kicks me all day long.",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) Really? So she's tough, huh?",
        "Lizzie: You surprised? It makes it real, doesn't it? There's really a little person in there.",
        "Jonathan: That freak you out?",
        "Lizzie: Sometimes. Sometimes it's kind of nice to be needed. Even if the thing that needs me is half yours.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Wow. One crazy night...",
        "Lizzie: You were just trying to forget Tammy, and I was just trying to forget Coop. And now...",

And I wasn't supposed to fall in love with him, I was just supposed to get him adopted by somebody else. But I fell in love and I couldn't help it. I took him home with me. The people that I work with are the same people that I go out with on the weekends. We all hang out, we all go on vacations together and hang out in the city. We're all good friends.

        "Tammy: What do you want from me?",
        "Alan: Tammy, I admire your loyalty. And I think you are a very sensible young lady.",
        "Tammy: If I were sensible, why would I be with Jonathan?",
        "Alan: I realize the guy is, um... a little volatile at times, overly emotional. Even... irrational. But you, on the other hand, you were raised the daughter of Prince Richard Winslow, and you understand power, and how power can be used for the good or for the ill.",
        "Tammy: And?",
        "Alan: Your schooling, Jonathan's bar, credit cards... you see, this is just a taste of what I can do. Now, you're much smarter than Jonathan. He'll listen to you. Get him to relinquish all of his rights to Elizabeth's baby.",
        "Tammy: His baby.",

        "Jonathan: Ha ha. That's not saying much.",
        "Lizzie: No, I guess not.",
        "Jonathan: Well, they say that having a baby changes you.",

        "Jonathan: Well, who knows what else could change, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: What do you mean?",

        "Reva: Yeah, well, I wouldn't know what to say.",
        "Bartender: It's hard for other people. Once the doctor comes and gives you the bad news, your life changes forever. I used to work on Wall Street, 70, 80 hours a week, no vacation. I just got back from hiking Costa Rica. I'm more alive now than I've ever been before, and I plan on staying that way.",
        "Reva: And your personal life?",
        "Bartender: My wife left when I lost my hair. No, that's a bad joke. All I'm trying to say is, there's life after cancer. Watch for it.",

        "Reva: Wow! Just think how great it would be if you did this on a more regular basis.",
        "Colin: Well, I'd never get any work done if, uh... I mean...",
        "Reva: You'd be a lot happier.",

        "Reva: No, actually, I'd say they're meant to be broken. But then I'm an old pro at this. Ah, ah, ah. You have to learn to crawl before you walk, grasshopper. But don't quote me on that.",

        "Tammy: There you are.",
        "Jonathan: Oh. That's nice.",
        "Tammy: I just had a great idea. Let's go back to that island and not let anybody find us. I just want to have you all to myself.",
        "Jonathan: You don't know how quick I could go for that. What's up with you?",
        "Tammy: Nothing.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. ( Laughs ) That's not working. Tell me what happened.",
        "Tammy: Alan came by.",
        "Jonathan: He waited until I left.",
        "Tammy: I don't know.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. He wanted to deliver a message. What did he say?",
        "Tammy: Nothing.",
        "Jonathan: What did he say?",
        "Tammy: They took away my spot for school in the fall.",
        "Jonathan: I knew he was going to come after you next.",
        "Tammy: You scare me when you do that.",
        "Jonathan: What? I'm not breaking anything.",
        "Tammy: No... it's when you get real quiet that the smoke and fire comes next.",
        "Jonathan: Mm-mm. No fire. Not this time.",
        "Tammy: Where are you going?",
        "Jonathan: Alan thinks that he can play dirty? Attack you because you're my weak spot? Alan has a weak spot too.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan...",
        "Jonathan: I'll see you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Well, I was about to send security out after you. How's the baby?",

        "Alan: I'm glad to hear that.",
        "Lizzie: Why? Do you think I'm not able to take care of my own daughter?",
        "Alan: I do have my concerns, Elizabeth...",
        "Lizzie: Well, don't! You can't do anything except make things harder for Jonathan and me.",

        "Alan: And if I don't?",
        "Lizzie: You're really not going to do...?",
        "Alan: What you tell me to? No, Elizabeth. Because, you see, I've finally found the chink in that thug's armor, and I'm going to exploit it until he bleeds.",

        "Ava: I admit I jumped to conclusions, and I am sorry about that.",

        "Olivia: They're lucky to have a friend like you.",

        "Olivia: No, not really.",
        "Ava: Okay, this is usually the part where I'm like fighting you off, or...",
        "Olivia: No, no. Don't get me wrong. I mean, I did think about coming down here and tearing into you. You know, exposing you for the back-stabbing hypocrite you seem to be. But then I thought if anything should happen to Frank or Buzz, you would never forgive yourself.",
        "Ava: Okay, um, whiplash, hold on. What do you mean, if something happens to either one of them?",
        "Olivia: Well, you don't think that Frank would take something like this well? I mean, you dropped a bomb on him.",
        "Ava: What happened?",
        "Olivia: I tried to stop him, but he was determined to go after his father, and who knows what's going to happen? They're very passionate men, Ava. But whatever does happen, you shouldn't feel responsible or guilty. It's not your fault.",

        "Frank: Let me finish.",
        "Buzz: What?",
        "Frank: Let me finish. After I found out that the two of you slept at the Inn, I asked you, I said, \"Was it serious between the two of you?\"",
        "Buzz: Frank...",
        "Frank: All I wanted was the truth, Dad.",
        "Buzz: Frank!",
        "Frank: And then you swore up and down that you said it was a one-time thing!",
        "Buzz: I thought it was over, Frank!",

        "Josh: No, no, that's alright. You've already done enough, thank you.",
        "Cassie: And I've loved every minute of it.",

        "Cassie: No. Josh, no.",
        "Josh: No, no, I just want to see how it looks, that's all. Thank you for all the work you've done. (Laughs ) It's a good thing that we're not French because then I would... have to kiss you on both cheeks.",

        "Reva: Well, I've always been fearless, but what I'm looking for from you is a little spontaneity.",
        "Colin: Like this?",
        "Reva: Whoa. How long have you been holding that in?",
        "Colin: You said be spontaneous. You had the cure for what ails me. I was just trying to be a good patient.",
        "Reva: And so you just felt like kissing me?",
        "Colin: Yes, in fact, I could get used to it.",
        "Reva: No! Whoa, whoa! A little too much spontaneity for you. You know, too much of a good thing can be a bad thing. Just ask my husband.",
        "Bartender: Do you need a hand?",
        "Reva: Uh, no, no, we're... we're okay. But the good doctor here, he needs to get back to the clinic before he starts kissing everyone in the room.",
        "Bartender: Yeah, yeah. Well, he's cute and all, but, uh, not my type, huh?",
        "Reva: ( Laughs )",

        "Colin: No, wait, wait... I've got a dare for you. In fact, I have a... I have a triple, quadruple, practically nuclear dog dare.",
        "Reva: Just as long as it doesn't have anything to do with kissing.",
        "Colin: Okay, I dare you to tell me, with the exception of streaking and the race car driving, I dare you to tell me that there has ever, ever been a better day than this.",

        "Josh: Thank you.",
        "Cassie: The only thing missing is Reva. I know you must be wishing that she were here with us.",
        "Josh: Yeah, that's the thing, though. I'm not.",
        "Cassie: Isn't this where one of us should be saying something? ( Clears throat )",
        "Josh: I think so, yes, but I don't really know what that would be. Cassie...",
        "Cassie: Let's blame it on the champagne. I, uh... I really should get back to work.",
        "Josh: Oh. What I was going to say is that when this day started, and I received H.B.'s medal, I... I couldn't wait to share that with Reva. But, um... the way things turned out, I'm... I'm really glad that I was able to have this moment with you.",

        "Frank: Yes, you are lying, you're lying to yourself! Dad! Dad! Back up here. You're right. You're right, maybe I should stop lying to myself. It's obvious I love Olivia. I've loved her from the very beginning. I was trying to win her over. And obviously she doesn't feel the same way. You know the biggest problem between us, where we always get into danger in this family?",

        "Ava: I was ready to take responsibility and blame if they started fighting.",
        "Olivia: I understand.",
        "Ava: And then I got an earful of your passive-aggressive crap. And it totally cured me.",
        "Olivia: Passive-aggressive?",
        "Ava: Why didn't you just throw a glass of water in my face, Olivia? It would have been more honest.",
        "Olivia: You're even too stupid to be scared! You are like a deer caught in headlights. You are going to get run over, girl. Oh, Ava. Do me a favor. Tonight, when you go to bed, think about Coop. Just think about how much you love him and want him. Think about how much you're going to miss him.",
