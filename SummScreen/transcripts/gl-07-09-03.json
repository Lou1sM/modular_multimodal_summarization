    "Recap": [
        "Marah caught Michelle's bouquet, but balked at the idea that she could be the next bride. Pop star Daniel Bedingfield, an old friend of Tony's, then performed for the bride and groom. Christopher arrived at the barbecue, and told Reva that he wanted her to go to a conference with him in Milan the next day. Josh was visibly irritated at the idea, and Reva thought he was rude. Josh asked what he could do to fix things between them; he apologized, but admitted he would do the same thing again if the situation presented itself. Reva said she couldn't get past that, and thought she should go to Milan after all. Danny promised both Ed and Michelle that his marriage would work this time. Danny and Michelle then shared their wedding night with champagne, dancing, and peanut butter cups. Harley told Gus that Mrs. Hendon's killer was wearing a signet ring, like Mitch Hendon's. She thought he may have tried to make it look like one of the serial killings. This would take suspicion off Ben, since he had no motive for the other killings. Holly found Ben unconscious underwater in the hot tub. When Ed and Rick pulled him out, they discovered a stab wound in his abdomen; it was made by an ice pick that Frank found in the bushes. Eden appeared just as Ben was being rushed to the hospital, and Gus was suspicious."

        "Gus: Why do you insist on pinning these murders on Eden?",
        "Harley: I'm just following the evidence.",
        "Gus: As long as the evidence leads you away from Ben Reade, right?",
        "Harley: Look at these.",
        "Gus: Yeah. The autopsy photos of Ramona Hendon. I've seen these.",
        "Harley: Look at the bruise on her shoulder.",
        "Gus: I know all about the bruise on her shoulder. We've ordered extreme close- ups on these. They're coming.",
        "Harley: Okay, well, when you get them back I think you'll find that they match a man's large signet ring, the kind the killer wore when he held her under the water.",
        "Gus: Yeah, I thought of that as well, okay. I've thought about the ring. I've gone through Ben Reade's things. He doesn't own a ring like this, or we couldn't find one, anyway.",
        "Harley: Mitch Hendon does. My dad got one just like that when he was in the service. He and Mitch Hendon served in the same unit.",
        "Gus: So you like Mitch for these murders.",
        "Harley: I... Yeah. He has motive. And you know what? If Ben didn't murder Ramona, then his motive is starting to look weaker and weaker, isn't it?",
        "Gus: Yeah. Let's just back up for a second. Shall we? Where did you get these photos in the first place?",
        "Harley: Rick gave them to me. I mean, I took them from Rick and I had them copied.",
        "Gus: In your efforts to try to pin these murders on Eden.",
        "Harley: I am looking at these murders objectively. I have no need to pin them on anyone or to protect anyone. Look, I know this is hard for you, but if you want to protect your sister, maybe you should take a step back and realize that her problems are bigger than you know.",
        "Gus: I know that my sister's got problems, okay, and I know that she's hiding something. I just... I just don't know what.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: So, you can do it? You can do it. Great, Cassie. That's great. No, really, whatever you can swing. Perfect. That's perfect.",
        "Michelle: Okay, great, you guys. Thank you so much. Can you take this into... Okay! All you single ladies up front and center.",
        "Blake: No.",
        "Michelle: Get ready! (Good-natured grumbling) Are you ready? Here comes the next bride. (Applause)",
        "Marah: That's not fair! I would have ducked, too. I wasn't ready.",
        "Blake: Oh, that's brilliant. Did Reva see that? Where is Reva?",
        "Josh: I don't know. Maybe in the kitchen or something. Let me go find her.",
        "Marah: So, babe, you ready for Bridezilla?",
        "Tony: Any time.",
        "Danny: Good catch.",
        "Michelle: You guys are angels. Thank you guys so much.",
        "Marah: You're welcome.",
        "Danny: This really... This was fantastic. It was everything we ever wanted, but we just didn't know. Well, she didn't know.",
        "Marah: Well, it was Tony's idea, so...",
        "Tony: Well, sort of. But if it wasn't for Marah, this would have never happened.",
        "Michelle: Well, you're a sweetheart. And you know, now that you've had all the practice with the planning...",
        "Marah: Whoa! Don't you even go near the \"M\" word, okay? That's a long way off. We're still young, right, babe? You know what? We have one more great surprise for you so you guys just wait right here.",
        "Tony: Oh, yeah. We'll be right back. We'll be right back.",
        "Josh: Reva, look, I'm sorry, okay? I know you're mad at me, I get that, and you have every right to be, so why don't you just lay it on me, okay? Just give me both barrels here.",
        "Reva: We're at a party, Joshua.",
        "Josh: I know that, and yesterday we were at Shayne's graduation, and tomorrow we'll be somewhere else. But the fact is that right now we're alone, so once again, Reva, I'm sorry. Just tell me what it is that we have to do to make things right between us.",
        "Christopher: Reva!",
        "Reva: Hey!",
        "Christopher: I hope I'm not too late.",
        "Reva: No. As a matter of fact, you're just in time.",
        "Josh: Um, have we met?",
        "Reva: Oh, I'm sorry. This is Dr. Christopher Langham. I invited him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marah: This is so exciting.",
        "Tony: Are we ready?",
        "Daniel: Yeah, absolutely.",
        "Marah: Thank you so much for doing this.",
        "Daniel: Oh, Tony asked me. Let's do it.",
        "Tony: All right, man.",
        "Daniel: Yeah.",
        "Marah: Babe, how did you pull this off?",
        "Tony: Bedingfield? I've known the guy for years. I saw that he was doing some concerts in Chicago and I snagged him.",
        "Marah: Thank you. (Laughter)",
        "Michelle: Um, Danny?",
        "Danny: Huh?",
        "Michelle: Isn't that... Huh?",
        "Danny: Daniel Bedingfield. Hey. He's an old friend of Tony's. How are you? Long time, no see.",
        "Michelle: Hi.",
        "Daniel: You guys did it! Congratulations. Thank you so much for letting me be part of the first dance of Mr. And Mrs. Danny Santos.",
        "Danny: Thanks.",
        "Daniel: If you're not the one then why does my soul feel glad today? If you're not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way? If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call? If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all? I'll never know what the future brings but I know you're here with me now we'll make it through and I hope you are the one I share my life with I don't want to run away but I can't take I don't understand if I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am? Is there any way that I could stay in your arms? If I don't need you then why am I crying on my bed? If I don't need you then why does your name resound in my head? If you're not for me then why does this distance maim my life? If you're not for me then why do I dream of you as my wife? I don't know why you're so far away but I know that this much is true we'll make it through and I hope you are the one I share my life with and I wish that you could be the one I die with and I pray that you're the one I build my home with I hope I love you all my life I don't want to run away but I can't take it I don't understand if I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am? Is there any way that I can stay in your arms? Because darling, I miss you body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away and I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today 'cause I love you whether it's wrong or right and though I can't be with you tonight you know my heart is by your side I don't want to run away but I can't take it I don't understand if I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am? Is there any way that I could stay in your arms?",
        "Tony: Daniel Bedingfield, I owe you big-time, man! (Cheers and applause)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Well, Dr. Langham, it's nice to meet you. I've heard a lot about you.",
        "Christopher: And I, you.",
        "Josh: What exactly brings you to Springfield?",
        "Christopher: Work.",
        "Josh: Really?",
        "Reva: Yes. He's going to be here for a while, too, so I thought maybe it might be nice for him to come over and meet some of the people.",
        "Josh: You have work here?",
        "Christopher: Yes. A research project at the university.",
        "Josh: Well, that surprises me, Dr. Langham. See, I...",
        "Christopher: Please, I'm Chris.",
        "Josh: Right. It surprises me because of what you do. Springfield University is not exactly a center for the paranormal, is it?",
        "Christopher: Well, I follow the money, Josh, like any researcher.",
        "Reva: Spaulding Enterprises funded a huge grant.",
        "Josh: Oh, they love throwing money around, don't they? Bless their hearts.",
        "Christopher: Actually, Reva being here was a big incentive for me to go after them. She's going to be an important part of the study.",
        "Josh: She is? I don't know that... Did you tell me that?",
        "Reva: I haven't made any decision yet.",
        "Christopher: Well, I'm hoping a trip to Milan will persuade you.",
        "Josh: Excuse me?",
        "Reva: He has a conference there. You're leaving when? Tomorrow?",
        "Christopher: Yeah, that's right. I didn't mention it yesterday but the more I think about it, I'd really like you to come. There's still a lot of seats left on the plane. I figured it'd be the perfect way for us to start our work.",
        "Reva: It sounds so fabulous but I really can't leave now. Shayne's only home for another month or so.",
        "Christopher: Oh, really? He made a decision then?",
        "Reva: A decision was made. He's been drafted by a major league team and he'll be leaving soon.",
        "Christopher: Oh, well. It was worth a try.",
        "Josh: You know what? There's still a lot of people here out on the patio, probably. You said you came here to meet some people, right.",
        "Christopher: Thanks. I came mainly to see Reva.",
        "Marah: Mom, have you seen the tray... Dr. Langham, hi.",
        "Christopher: Hi, Marah. Nice to see you again.",
        "Josh: Again?",
        "Marah: We met at the demonstration at the country club.",
        "Josh: Demonstration? I... Did I know about that?",
        "Reva: No.",
        "Josh: Did you tell me?",
        "Reva: Well, yeah, actually I told you about it. You must have had other things on your mind.",
        "Marah: Mom, the tray with the birdseed?",
        "Reva: Yes. On the table. Right there.",
        "Marah: Thanks. You guys, come on. Danny and Michelle are leaving.",
        "Reva: Okay, we'll be there in a minute.",
        "Josh: Wow. Dr. Langham, it seems that you have met my entire family. That's really something. And now you've met me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ed: It's wonderful seeing you so happy.",
        "Michelle: That's because you were here to give me away. It made all the difference in the world. You will never know. Thank you, Dad.",
        "Danny: Michelle and I have decided that you are going to be our good luck charm.",
        "Ed: Hey, whatever works, you know?",
        "Danny: We will, this time. All right? I promise.",
        "Ed: I'm not the one you married.",
        "Danny: Well, yeah. When I married Michelle, I married this entire family. I mean it. I'm going to make all of you proud.",
        "Ed: Just make her happy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marah: Okay, birdseed instead of rice.",
        "Blake: Oh, very smart. You read the manual, didn't you?",
        "Holly: Good thing. You're going to be next.",
        "Marah: Oh, yeah. You guys, stop it. All of you. (Laughter)",
        "Tony: Hey, babe.",
        "Marah: Hey, honey.",
        "Tony: Can you excuse us?",
        "Marah: What's up?",
        "Tony: What took you so long?",
        "Marah: Well, it was pretty heavy in the kitchen. My parents were in there and one of my mom's friends, and they were talking about something.",
        "Tony: What's up?",
        "Marah: I don't know, but I'll find out.",
        "Tony: But you're okay?",
        "Marah: Yeah. Yeah, why? What's up?",
        "Tony: The way that you freaked out, about the \"M\" word.",
        "Marah: Oh, babe, they were just joking. I mean... What? You weren't thinking...?",
        "Tony: Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry. I will not say that word again. Last time I said \"marriage\" we didn't speak for months.",
        "Marah: That was different. That was a long time ago. I love you.",
        "Tony: I know. And I love you. So why won't you marry me?",
        "Marah: (Laughs nervously) I didn't say that I wouldn't marry you. I just... That's...",
        "Tony: (Laughs)",
        "Marah: Oh, you little brat.",
        "Tony: (Laughs) I got you.",
        "Marah: Yes, you did get me. (Laughs) Don't scare me like that.",
        "Rick: Marah, hurry up. They're trying to leave.",
        "Marah: Okay, okay.",
        "Frank: Rick, hold on. I need a final picture here, big man. Oh, come on. I'm out of film!",
        "Darci: I've got a camera in my purse out at the car. I can go get it and meet you out front, if... if you want me to stay.",
        "Frank: It's up to you. Thanks.",
        "Danny: Wow, it looks like we got to. All right, you ready to rumble?",
        "Michelle: All right, let's go.",
        "Danny: All right. (Crowd cheering)",
        "Holly: Hey. How are you doing?",
        "Ed: I'm fine. There's a saying: You're only as happy as your happiest child. So tonight I'm a happy man.",
        "Holly: Really?",
        "Ed: I'm sorry all that stuff happened with Ben earlier.",
        "Holly: It's not your fault. I just feel terrible. I wish I could have known how to...",
        "Ed: Don't... Just let it go. There's nothing you could have done anyway.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: All right, run it all down for me. Tell me what you're thinking.",
        "Harley: You're sure? I thought you might take my head off when you found out...",
        "Gus: Just be my clear-thinking mind for me. Go ahead. What have you got?",
        "Harley: Okay, I've got two theories here. Okay, one: If Mitch Hendon murdered his wife, then maybe he did all the other killings, too, to make her look like she was just one in a string of serial killings.",
        "Gus: No, because he's got an airtight alibi for the country club murder.",
        "Harley: Okay, still a possibility. Here's the other one: Mitch is a copycat. See, all the other murders, they were already public. So maybe he decides he can kill Ramona and she'll just look like one in the chain.",
        "Gus: Well, that would mean that we have two killers.",
        "Harley: Maybe.",
        "Gus: Hm.",
        "Harley: Listen, why do you think Eden is hiding something?",
        "Gus: Because I asked her for all of her records for her escort service and she said she didn't have any.",
        "Harley: Be pretty smart-- illegal business and all.",
        "Gus: Mm-hmm, but that's not her. See, ever since she was a little girl and she could hold a pair of scissors and a can of paste, she would document every single minute of her life.",
        "Harley: Really?",
        "Gus: Oh, yes.",
        "Harley: I don't see her as that dried-flower newspaper clipping kind of gal.",
        "Gus: Well, she is. She documents everything, and believe me, she's got documents and records of her business. She's just got them somewhere, I know it",
        "Harley: All right. What do you want to do next?",
        "Gus: I say we bring Mitch Hendon in, we throw him against the wall, we see if he pops. And then we get a search warrant for one Eden August. (Cell phone rings) Aitoro. What? No, no, no. Just get all units on it right away. You track him down.",
        "Harley: What? What is it?",
        "Gus: Ben Reade shook the guy that we had tailing him. He's on the loose.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Christopher: It seems I've brought this conference up at a bad time.",
        "Reva: You know, I'm so sorry that you didn't get here sooner. You missed half the party, but there's still people out there so why don't you go say hello to them, and I'll call you later about the conference.",
        "Christopher: Sure. It was nice to meet you, Josh.",
        "Josh: Hey, it was great to meet you, too. Really. A joy. Chris.",
        "Reva: At least you waited until he got out the door. Could you have been a little more rude?",
        "Josh: Reva, you've got to be kidding me. I mean, come on. The guy comes waltzing in here, I've never laid eyes on him in my life, he wants to take you to Europe tomorrow. You've agreed to work with him in some capacity. He knows all my family. And you've told him private things about our life.",
        "Reva: I haven't told him anything about Shayne.",
        "Josh: He knows about Shayne.",
        "Reva: Well, yeah, because it came up in our work. He... There were some images I was getting of Shayne that didn't make any sense. And it's because there were facts that I didn't know about. So, you know, it's...",
        "Marah: Hey, you guys, you missed it.",
        "Tony: Yeah. Danny and Michelle just left.",
        "Reva: So the party's winding down? That's good, because I feel like leaving.",
        "Marah: Babe, you know what? I have some summer clothes I need to pick up at the house, so I can just go there and come back to the museum.",
        "Tony: Okay, I'll drive you.",
        "Marah: You know what? I'll catch a ride from my parents.",
        "Reva: No problem.",
        "Ed: This can't be our kitchen.",
        "Rick: The cleaning fairies showed up.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, it's a wedding present for the father of the bride.",
        "Mel: And for his daughter-in-law. Thank you so much, Reva.",
        "Reva: You're welcome. Congratulations, Ed.",
        "Ed: Thanks.",
        "Josh: Thank you, Ed. Great party.",
        "Ed: Well, you guys don't have to run off now?",
        "Reva: Yeah, actually we do.",
        "Ed: We're celebrating...",
        "Josh: We have to.",
        "Reva: We have to do some things.",
        "Josh: Sorry. Thank you very much, though.",
        "Ed: Thank you for coming.",
        "Reva: You bet.",
        "Ed: And you... you throw a wonderful wedding.",
        "Marah: Well, thank you for letting me have it. Babe, I love you. I've got to...",
        "Mel: Tony, is there something wrong?",
        "Tony: Looks like.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: Ross, I left my purse up here on the picnic table, I think.",
        "Holly: And Clarissa had mine here somewhere.",
        "Ross: Yeah, Blake, can you hurry it up? I want to call Ben before it gets too late and make sure he's okay.",
        "Blake: Found it.",
        "Ross: Good girl. Holly, can we give you a ride home?",
        "Holly: No, I think I'll stay with Ed. It seems like he needs company. Thank you again for everything you've done for Ben.",
        "Ross: Don't mention it. My pleasure. We'll call you tomorrow.",
        "Holly: Okay.",
        "Blake: Bye.",
        "Holly: Good night. (Screams)",
        "Holly: Help! Somebody, quick! Help! Somebody! Help me!",
        "Ed: What? Oh, come on.",
        "Holly: It's Ben! It's Ben!",
        "Ed: What happened?",
        "Holly: He was in the water.",
        "Rick: He's in the water.",
        "Ed: Do you know what happened?",
        "Holly: I don't know.",
        "Ed: Get something underneath him. All right, gently. Gently put him down. Okay.",
        "Mel: I'll get my bag. I'll get my bag.",
        "Frank: Has somebody got a cell phone? This is Chief Cooper. ...1713 Coventry Road. We've got a possible drowning. What's your E.T.A.? All right, I'll hold.",
        "Rick: He's breathing, but it's very shallow.",
        "Ed: His pulse is fast. He's probably in shock. Any idea how long he was in the water?",
        "Holly: I don't know. It couldn't have been long.",
        "Blake: No, we were here just five minutes ago.",
        "Tony: Practically.",
        "Ed: All right, pupils are good.",
        "Rick: He's got a puncture wound here. And it's not bleeding, but it looks deep.",
        "Ed: All right, Frank, tell the EMTs we have an abdominal wound. They've got to get here fast. Fast!",
        "Frank: We also have an abdominal wound. What's your E.T.A.? All right, ambulance will be here in five minutes.",
        "Rick: Could somebody get a blanket from the house, please?",
        "Ross: I got it.",
        "Ed: Check to see if there are any other puncture wounds. Let's get the back-up here, fast.",
        "Mel: What's going on?",
        "Blake: Frank, the killer threatened Ben. Why didn't he have protection?",
        "Frank: Blake, we had surveillance on him.",
        "Blake: (Scoffs) Pretty lousy surveillance. And it wasn't for protection.",
        "Ross: Rick.",
        "Rick: All right, thanks, Ross.",
        "Tony: What are you doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marah: All right, guys, I'm not leaving until you tell me what's going on.",
        "Reva: Sweetheart, it's nothing for you to...",
        "Josh: We're fine. It's a spat.",
        "Marah: It looks like more than that.",
        "Josh: Your mom and I are in disagreement over a choice that was made. She sees it one way; I see it another way. But I'm pretty sure things are going to be fine.",
        "Marah: So this is about Shayne, right, Mom? Are you mad about him going pro, because I think it's really what he wanted. I mean, he was talking about it at graduation and today he was really excited.",
        "Reva: I know.",
        "Josh: Look, your mom and I disagree on this. You know that, right? Now, Shayne said to me that he wished he had somebody who would make this decision for him and in a way, I did that. I signed him up with a sports agent.",
        "Marah: Yeah, I know. Shayne told me. And though I was surprised you did that, Shayne seems okay.",
        "Josh: Well, the thing is, I didn't tell Shayne what I was doing. You know? There was a window of opportunity, the draft was coming up, I didn't want him to miss it, so I signed him up with the agent, the agent submitted him for the draft. I also did not tell your mom. And that was wrong.",
        "Marah: So let me get this straight: Shayne had to go pro, even if he hadn't wanted to?",
        "Josh: No. Not necessarily. And he made the choice to go pro on his own, before he found out what I had done.",
        "Marah: Yeah, he said that. So, it seems as though everything has worked out the way he wanted it.",
        "Josh: Yes.",
        "Marah: Mom?",
        "Reva: Yeah. Everything's fine.",
        "Marah: And you know that Shayne can go back to school if he decides that that's what he wants to do, right?",
        "Reva: Yes, honey. I do know that. You know what? Why don't you go ahead and take our car back to the museum? I'm sure Tony's waiting for you.",
        "Marah: You know, or you could drive me and we could go hang out?",
        "Reva: Sweetheart, it's fine. Everything is fine. Don't you worry.",
        "Marah: Are you sure?",
        "Reva: Yes, I'm sure. Go back to that cute boy. I'll call you tomorrow, okay?",
        "Marah: Okay. Goodnight.",
        "Reva: Goodnight.",
        "Marah: Good night, Dad.",
        "Josh: I love you, sweetheart. Goodnight.",
        "Marah: You guys play nice.",
        "Reva: (Laughs) Well, that was low. You want to go at me, you don't do it through my daughter.",
        "Josh: Reva, I'm not trying to \"go at you.\" Marah's not a child anymore. She wants to know what's going on, she has a right to know what's going on. And everybody else is going to know if things keep up like this.",
        "Reva: Like this?",
        "Josh: Reva, it's done. I'm sorry it had to be that way. I'm sorry I didn't tell you what I was doing, but it worked out.",
        "Reva: Did it?",
        "Josh: Shayne's doing what he wants to do. Isn't that the most important thing here? Really? Just tell me what it is that has to happen for us to work this out.",
        "Reva: I don't know, but I'll tell you one thing: Nothing's going to get \"worked out\" with a couple of \"sorrys\" here or in Ed Bauer's kitchen. And that's something you're going to have to accept.",

        "Danny: Hey, hey. What's the rush? No, no. We haven't even had the reception yet.",
        "Michelle: Oh, yeah? Those hot dogs and the s'mores counted on my father's patio.",
        "Danny: Obviously you have not seen the spread.",
        "Michelle: (Gasps)",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Michelle: Oh, look at this!",
        "Danny: And... Yes!",
        "Michelle: Oh, peanut butter cups! Yes. We're going to have to feed each other these.",
        "Danny: All right. Wait. And this. I want to make sure the flash is working. Okay.",
        "Michelle: Ready? Smile. (Laughter)",
        "Danny: I want get one of you. Ready?",
        "Michelle: Mm-hmm.",
        "Danny: Okay.",
        "Michelle: (Laughs) This is going to be very dangerous later, this camera.",
        "Danny: You think? So our kid won't get to see all the wedding pictures.",
        "Michelle: Well, our kid got to be there. That's more than most kids...",
        "Danny: Oh, don't say that ever again. Please?",
        "Michelle: It's okay.",
        "Danny: Please?",
        "Michelle: Let's dance. Let's put some music on. That's tradition, too, you know.",
        "Danny: Huh? Huh?",
        "Michelle: You taste like peanut butter. (Music playing)",
        "Danny: You were scared, weren't you? To get married again, to be tied to me. It's okay. You can tell me now.",
        "Michelle: Not of you. I've never, ever been scared about you, Danny. I love you. And I realize everything that you've done to get us here. To you.",
        "Danny: To us. To another shot at getting it right.",

        "Ed: Get him on his side. Frank?",
        "Rick: No.",
        "Gus: What happened?",
        "Frank: Well, we're not sure. This place was deserted for about five or ten minutes, and Holly got back here and found Ben underneath the water unconscious. I searched the area, didn't find anything, nobody saw anything so I called C.S.U. They're on their way over here.",
        "Harley: Will he be okay?",
        "Frank: Not sure about that either. Ed said he found a little small puncture wound. Might be internal bleeding.",
        "Gus: Any signs of a weapon?",
        "Frank: I found this in the bushes.",
        "Harley: Ooh.",
        "Gus: Ice pick.",
        "Frank: Yep.",
        "Ross: Frank, I want a guard for my client starting tonight. He needs protection now that he's a victim and not a suspect.",
        "Gus: Not so fast, Marler. We don't know that for sure.",
        "Ross: Gus, take a look at him. What does it take to convince you?",
        "Gus: Well.",
        "Mel: Shh, I need quiet. Okay, I'm getting breath sounds bilaterally but they're shallow.",
        "Rick: Of course he's hypotensive. Open the rings wide open. Let's transport him when he's stable.",
        "Mel: We'll hook him up in the ambulance, okay, because I think he's getting hypothermic.",
        "Rick: All right.",
        "Mel: Let's go.",
        "Gus: Excuse me. I thought you went home.",
        "Eden: Look, I already talked to Frank, okay. I was looking to see if Bill was back here.",
        "Gus: Yeah, what time was that?",
        "Eden: I don't know. I didn't look at my watch. What is this?",
        "Tony: Gus, she was with me from the moment she got here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Okay, I... I... I realize this is not going to magically go away. But how could we make it... it go away? What... what... What can I say? What can I do, Reva?",
        "Reva: I don't know.",
        "Josh: Does it even matter to you that Shayne is happy? That he has this opportunity of a lifetime ahead of him, that he's going to...",
        "Reva: Would you stop making your case, Joshua? Of course it matters that Shayne's happy. That's all I ever wanted.",
        "Josh: Really, is it? Because it seems like... Part of what's made you angry is that he didn't make the choice you wanted him to, Reva...",
        "Reva: Damn it, Joshua! Do you really think that's the problem here?",
        "Josh: I don't know!",
        "Reva: It's not, it's you! It's what you did and how you did it!",
        "Josh: Okay, then I am sorry!",
        "Reva: Stop saying that.",
        "Josh: But I am! I'm sorry, Reva...",
        "Reva: No, you're not. You're not sorry. You're sorry that I'm angry, but you're not sorry that you went behind my back.",
        "Josh: That's not true. I really am, Reva. I am sorry. I'm sorry things couldn't have been done in a different way.",
        "Reva: But they could have been done differently. You decided to have it happen like this. Because if Shayne and... and I had been involved in this, then it would have been messy. And maybe things wouldn't have turned out the way you wanted; the right way. So don't tell me you're sorry and that you wish things could have been differently. Because they're exactly how you wanted them to be.",
        "Josh: Well, this is not what I wanted to...",
        "Reva: Well, what the hell did you expect to happen?",
        "Josh: I don't know! I don't know! I guess I figured you'd be upset, but once you saw how happy Shayne was, things might get a little bit better.",
        "Reva: Do you want things to be better? Do you? Then just... Look me in the eye and tell me that if you had the opportunity to do this all over again, that you would do it differently. Just tell me that. You can't. You can't say it.",
        "Josh: Do you really think that I would have taken the steps I took if I didn't believe in my heart that it was the only way?",
        "Reva: So you'd shut me out again?",
        "Josh: (Sighs)",
        "Reva: You... you would go behind my back again, not even tell your own son that you were making a decision about his future without him.",
        "Josh: If the situation were the same, if one of our kids were facing an opportunity that I really believed they would regret if they let the opportunity go by, then, yes, I would do what I thought was the right thing to do.",
        "Reva: Well, then you see why \"I'm sorry\" is useless? Because you'd do it again, Joshua. And that's the problem. And I don't think I can get over that.",
        "Josh: So, what do we do now?",
        "Reva: I don't know. I mean, we can go over and over and around and around this, but it won't change. Maybe we need some time or... Some space. Maybe an ocean of space for a little while.",
        "Josh: You talking about this conference thing? You're thinking you're going to go? (Sighs)",
        "Reva: Maybe I should.",
        "Josh: You're going to take this, you're going to take our problems to... to Chris, Reva? What is this guy to you?",
        "Reva: Oh, don't... don't go there. He's an acquaintance...",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Reva: We work together and that is it.",
        "Josh: Fine, but I still think it's... it's... It's bad timing for you to go to Europe right now with some guy, Reva.",
        "Reva: I don't like what I'm about to say, but it's true: Right now, I don't care what you think, Joshua.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: You know what this means, don't you?",
        "Gus: Yeah, it means Marler's right. My number one suspect just became a victim.",
        "Harley: No, I meant the ice pick. Remember our theory? How each piece of evidence is connected to the previous murder? Something sharp. We thought it was the pin that was taken from Ariana.",
        "Gus: The pin we found in Eden's things.",
        "Harley: The pin that we took from Eden.",
        "Gus: So, wait, wait, what are you saying, that she improvised?",
        "Harley: I'm just saying, remember it. And I'm saying when you question Ben Reade, be ready. Hey, at least you got a live victim. Maybe you can finally solve this thing. I'll see you later.",
        "Frank: You ready?",
        "Gus: Yeah, just give me one second, Frank. Eden, I want you in my office first thing tomorrow morning.",
        "Tony: Gus, I already told you...",
        "Gus: And I want you to bring all of your business records with you, okay?",
        "Eden: I told you I don't have them...",
        "Gus: Bring your business records with you!",
        "Eden: Hey, thanks for standing up for me with Gus and... Frank.",
        "Tony: Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. You know, I don't get this. I was really starting to believe that Ben Reade was the killer.",
        "Eden: I know, me, too. Especially everything he said to me, I was really starting to get scared of him.",
        "Tony: Do you want me to take you home?",
        "Eden: Oh, thank you. Would you? But I've got to find Bill. Do you mind hanging out?",
        "Tony: No, no, I don't mind.",

        "Ed: Holly, there's no blame here.",
        "Holly: Well, I can take a sense of responsibility instead.",
        "Ed: If it's not yours to take...",
        "Holly: It is, it is. I mean, way back when Meg was born, I didn't think twice about sending him away to boarding school.",
        "Ed: Sweetheart, the wonderful thing about kids is they give you a million chances. A million chances to get it right. There's tomorrow.",
