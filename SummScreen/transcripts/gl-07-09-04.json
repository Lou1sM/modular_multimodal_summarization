Then i catch you with brad's wife. What did you do to her? \nAlexandra: I think it's best you don't know. \nGus: I think it's best that you tell me while I'm still calm. \nAlexandra: Oh, really? Well, this is calm, huh? \nGus: Just tell me what you did. What did you do? \nAlexandra: Okay. Harley called marie, asking her questions about brad and me. I just merely convinced marie that she should do what is best for everyone. \nGus: What is that, lie? \nAlexandra: (Laughs) why are you so upset, for pete's sake?

I cannot find gus anywhere. \nFrank: A case? The only case I'm working on with gus is the spaulding drug situation. \nHarley: Speaking of which, i might be able to offer you a little closure.

But fortunately, you do. \nMichelle: Yeah, i kind of do, don't I? \nDanny: Yeah, you do. \nMichelle: Well, you said we were going out, so i'm trying to look special.

Considering this massive conspiracy that we have been perpetrating is about to blow up in our face. \nAlexandra: I took care of marie, and there's no way anyone can prove I had anything to do with brad covering up that drug traffic. And by the way, you are looking guilty most of the time. Heavens, it's a wonder you survived undercover.\nGus: You know, maybe you're right. Maybe I should be more like you. Smiles all the time. \"Smiles, everybody, smiles,\" while we are invited down here by the mayor of springfield to have a meeting with the chief of police, who's suspicious of you. You're right. What am I thinking? It should be easy for me to lie. I've got it down to a science with my fiancee-- and that's really nice, too, starting out a whole new life based on a lie, after I get married. \nAlexandra: All right. \nGus: That's good. \nAlexandra: All right. But you are not the one who could go to prison. \nGus: What's the matter? Your confidence running out after paying off marie green? \n>>Lexandra: Well, you are hardly inspiring confidence in me. \nGus: That's because frank is involved now, and he's got his chick, darci, saying that you were in paris with brad green. Come on! The only thing that's going to stop frank from finding out everything is he's going to lose his job, get fired or get killed. Come on! \nAlexandra: There is always a way. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Frank: So you're saying marie was absolutely sure that brad green was acting independent of spaulding, right? \nHarley: Marie insisted that brad acted alone. \nFrank: Well, how does she know for sure? \nHarley: Marie's marriage consisted of three things: Spending money, crying, and being nosy. There is no way that alexandra was involved with brad in the drug thing without marie knowing. \nFrank: Well, there it is then. Well, you must be relieved, right? I mean, I know that's been weighing very heavily on your mind. I mean, can you imagine what would happen between you and gus if alexandra was involved? \nHarley: Well, now i don't have to think about it. Right? I can plan my wedding. \nFrank: Oh, sis, i just don't want anything to interfere with your happiness.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Buzz: Hey, you. \nAlexandra: What are you doing here? \nDarci: Ross told us to come down. \nBuzz: He said it was something we wouldn't want to miss.

Now, then, the city of springfield is grateful to the federal authorities for their help in arresting mr. Salerno. But as chief cooper has informed me any number of times, this case is far from closed, because when a criminal like mr. Salerno can infiltrate one of springfield's most established corporations, that means we have a lot of work to do. And with that in mind, i've established a special commission on organized crime, and I have selected a director for that commission, and that director is mr. Frank cooper.

Chief cooper, what is the commission going to be tackling first? \nFrank: Well, we will be conducting an exhaustive investigation to make absolutely sure that the recent sting operation captured all those involved in the antimonious case. \nReporter #1: Are you saying that there may be more arrests? \nFrank: I'm just saying that we'll go wherever the evidence leads us. \nReporter #1: Why don't we have a photo-op?
