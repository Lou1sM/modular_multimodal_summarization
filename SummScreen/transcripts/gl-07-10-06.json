        "Alan: Well, well, well, look who's here.",
        "Jonathan: Got something for you.",
        "Alan: What's that?",
        "Lizzie: Okay, that is scary.",
        "Jonathan: Sorry. I wanted to apologize for the way I've been acting. I know I've been making a bigger mess of things, and I hope you give me a chance to fix it.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, thank you. That's so sweet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Excuse me. Miss Hunter.",
        "Clerk: Yes.",
        "Tammy: I'm Tammy Winslow, a student at the university. I've seen you in admission's office, and I realize you're busy.",
        "Clerk: If this is a school matter, you need to address it at regular business hours.",
        "Tammy: It can't wait that long. I've been denied a place at school because of something I had absolutely nothing to do with.",
        "Clerk: Ms. Winslow, you tried to pay your tuition with a bad check. Policy, but it's against the law.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I really should go back to work.",
        "Josh: Cassie. I was just going to say that when this day started, and when I received H.B.'s medal, all I could think about is how much I couldn't wait to share that with Reva. But as the days progressed, I'm just really glad that we were able to share this moment together. And the truth is, I want to have a lot more of them. I know it's wrong, Cassie. But I have to have you.",
        "Cassie: No!",
        "Josh: Cassie, what's wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I could have sworn I turned off these lights before I left.",
        "Billy: You did. But I'm pretty handy with the light switch.",
        "Reva: Oh, it's so good to see you.",
        "Billy: It is a little disconcerting when you come to visit somebody in the hospital and their bed is empty.",
        "Reva: Well, the good doctor let me out of my cage for a night.",
        "Billy: Does that mean things are looking up?",
        "Reva: Well, until it is I'm going to grab every minute of regular life that I can. I even went to a bar next to the clinic tonight. I kind of made Colin take me out. I set him up on a date.",
        "Billy: A date?",
        "Reva: Oh, not with me. But I'll tell you something, I really... I almost felt like myself again. You know, I laughed, and I got hit on. Go figure, huh?",
        "Billy: Reva, it sounds like you're really enjoying yourself. Or maybe you're just enjoying being away from Josh.",
        "Reva: Billy, of course I want to go home to Joshua. I want to go home to everything that is in Springfield. But until I'm cleared to go home, I'm going to enjoy my life here at the clinic, as if it were Springfield.",
        "Billy: Well, you shouldn't have any problem doing that.",
        "Reva: I had a pretty good jump on it if I do say so myself. I drove a race car.",
        "Billy: A race car?",
        "Reva: I did. I got that sucker almost to 200 miles per hour. I got to play matchmaker, I got kissed.",
        "Billy: Wait, you got kissed by who?",
        "Reva: Colin at the bar.",
        "Billy: Wait a minute! I thought you said it wasn't a date.",
        "Reva: Well, it wasn't a date. It was a moment. I'll tell you something, the moment I'm really looking forward to is the moment that those lab results come in and I know I'm moving in the right direction, instead of... ( knock on the door )",
        "Colin: Oh, I'm sorry, I'll come back.",
        "Reva: No, the hell you will are those you look awful. Are those my results? Because if they're my results, I want to know what is going on now, quick. I want you to tell me now, quick.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I can't keep doing this, Josh.",
        "Josh: Doing what?",
        "Cassie: I can't... well... ( laughing ) for one thing, I can't keep wearing H.B.'s medal. That's for sure. If anyone should be wearing it, it should be Reva.",
        "Josh: Reva's not here.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, well, a few minutes ago you were about to talk to her. So I'm going to take a walk, and you can try her again.",
        "Josh: Please don't go! Cassie. I'm sorry. I just -- I feel like... I feel like the dog that's been chasing that truck one time too many, and sooner or later, I'm going to end up under the wheels.",
        "Cassie: Meaning what?",
        "Josh: Meaning that I am done trying to figure out what's going on with Reva and Billy. They have their secrets, that's fine. They can keep them. I don't care. I know that right now I'm exactly where I want to be. And I'm with someone who appreciates how important it is to me that my father is being honored now.",
        "Cassie: I do.",
        "Josh: I know. I feel like this was a confirmation for me, that the work that we've been doing together on this project has been right, and it's been good. And I know that if H.B. were here right now, he would probably plant a big old kiss on you to say thank you for the work that you've done. Or actually, knowing him, he would probably just kiss you because he would want to.",
        "Cassie: Josh...",
        "Josh: I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.",
        "Cassie: It's okay.",
        "Josh: It's not okay, Cassie. It's not okay. I'm just a little overwhelmed right now, and I'm saying things that are embarrassing you, and I apologize.",
        "Cassie: No, you're not.",
        "Josh: Yes, I am.",
        "Cassie: No, you're not. That's not it.",
        "Josh: Then what is it?",
        "Cassie: H.B. wouldn't want us to celebrate like this, just the two of us and champagne and oysters.",
        "Josh: You're right. It wouldn't be his style. He would much prefer to celebrate something like this with burgers and brew.",
        "Cassie: Right. And people. Lots and lots of people, right? So I think we should go and celebrate his way.",
        "Josh: After you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I was set up by Alan Spaulding. I didn't forge a check.",
        "Clerk: You're claiming one of the richest, most powerful men in the country personally arranged for your tuition check to bounce?",
        "Tammy: I've never even been late with a payment to the university, let alone cut a check. I pay all of my charges at the bookstore and the co-op up front and on time, and I'm a perfect student. I've been on the Dean's list since my first semester. Look, look.",
        "Clerk: When you defraud the university --",
        "Tammy: You don't believe me because Alan Spaulding just built the stupid baseball field at S.U. What are you doing?",
        "Clerk: No, you can't just leave. Stay away from me --",
        "Tammy: I'm sorry. I didn't mean --",
        "Clerk: This was assault. These people are witnesses. I am calling the police.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, Elizabeth, listen, I am not going to leave you alone with this guy.",
        "Lizzie: Jonathan is the baby's father, Granddad. Look, wouldn't it make more sense to find out what he is up to then let him sneak around behind our back? Let me talk to him alone.",
        "Alan: All right. Ten minutes, that's all.",
        "Lizzie: All right.",
        "Jonathan: Alan.",
        "Alan: Yes?",
        "Jonathan: Put those in water. (Laughing) Hope I didn't upset that guy.",
        "Lizzie: Why are you really here?",
        "Jonathan: Tammy said I should come and make nice with you because the two of us have a bagel in the toaster.",
        "Lizzie: It's a bagel you don't really care about, so don't pretend you do.",
        "Jonathan: You're right. The only thing in the world I do care about is Tammy, so...",
        "Lizzie: Please, spare me the love poem, okay.",
        "Jonathan: You may think I'd be the world's most dead-beatest dad, but Tammy is really into that kid, and she cares about you, too.",
        "Lizzie: It was really sweet of her to offer to be my birth coach.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, yeah, it's definitely better her than me. Can you imagine if my face was the first thing that that little monkey saw?",
        "Lizzie: Talk about scarred. Scarred for life!",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, look, I can fit into the picture in other ways. As far as this house goes, everybody is always talking about the baby, the baby, right? It probably feels like they don't even know you're here anymore. So you need somebody to look out for you, get your back. I'll do that. Let me do that. I can get your family off your case, and make Tammy happy at the same time. What's wrong with that?",
        "Lizzie: Okay. You are the most self-serving schemer I have ever met. ( Laughter ) Really.",
        "Jonathan: Well, it takes one to know one now, mother.",
        "Lizzie: (Laughing) Oh, does it really? You're so weird.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colin: I can't tell you what the results are yet.",
        "Reva: It's that bad?",
        "Colin: No, no, no. I just -- I haven't --",
        "Reva: Would you spit it out, please?",
        "Colin: I haven't seen them yet, the results.",
        "Reva: Don't try to protect me.",
        "Billy: What are you stalling for?",
        "Reva: I mean, whatever the news is, the worst of the worst possible news I can handle, just tell me what it is.",
        "Colin: I'm not protecting you, I promise.",
        "Reva: Then why are you dancing around the truth like this? Your eyes are all red, you can't spit the words out... what's -- oh, you're still drunk, is that it? You're still drunk, well on your way to being hungover. ( Laughing )",
        "Colin: And I really haven't seen your results yet...",
        "Reva: You had a better time tonight than I thought you did.",
        "Billy: Well, I'll be, what kind of hospital is this? The doctor gets drunk? Doctor kisses patient?",
        "Colin: About that...",
        "Reva: Don't apologize. That was good medicine when I needed some.",
        "Billy: Good medicine.",
        "Reva: Billy, would you relax. He is a better doctor than he is a kisser anyway.",
        "Colin: Galsworthy.",
        "Billy: What did you call me?",
        "Colin: Galsworthy, he is the lab tech. He just walked by with the results. I'll bet it's yours. I'll be right back.",
        "Billy: So, he is really not a good kisser? ( Laughing )",
        "Reva: So it's mine, right? Well?",
        "Colin: Removal of lymph nodes. Borders appeared clean...",
        "Reva: Doc, become line, in English, did the operation work or not?",
        "Colin: Yes, it worked.",
        "Billy: It's good news?",
        "Colin: I would characterize it as promising.",
        "Reva: That is good enough for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clerk: The police will be here any minute. Officer, officer, that's her, right there. Arrest her.",
        "Tammy: This is crazy. I didn't do anything.",
        "Remy: Everyone just calm down.",
        "Clerk: I'll calm down when you arrest her.",
        "Tammy: I'll calm down when she apologizes to me. I don't even know where this is coming from. I was just trying to clean up the problem, and she flipped out on me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: This isn't some scam you're working on to get your hands on all of that juicy Spaulding cash?",
        "Jonathan: No, I'm not into milking the Spaulding cash cow.",
        "Lizzie: Just here to please Tammy, huh?",
        "Jonathan: And make nice with you, yep.",
        "Lizzie: What about the baby.",
        "Jonathan: What about it?",
        "Lizzie: Has Tammy convinced you to lay a claim on her?",
        "Jonathan: What, and play daddy? What, are you kidding me. Imagine me and you walking down Main Street pushing a stroller.",
        "Lizzie: Like a scene from a horror film. People would be freaking out.",
        "Jonathan: The semen spawn.",
        "Alan: I think that is enough excitement for one night, Elizabeth. You need to get some rest.",
        "Jonathan: No, she's cool.",
        "Alan: The stress of a conversation with you is not good for the baby.",
        "Jonathan: As far as I can tell, the only one cranking the pressure around here is you. I was just trying to help Lizzie blow off some steam.",
        "Alan: Nobody asked you to.",
        "Jonathan: Nobody had to. I have this thing about bullies. Never could stand them, never will.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, who do you think has you and the baby's best interest at heart?",
        "Lizzie: That's easy. I do. I'm still not sure what you're selling, but it's okay because whatever it is, I'm not buying. And I don't like the bullying thing either. Stop it. Now, I'm a little tired, so good night.",
        "Alan: It's time for you to leave as well.",
        "Jonathan: Now, is that any way to talk to family.",
        "Alan: You're not family to me.",
        "Jonathan: Well, I've got a whole mess of genes floating around in that kid that says otherwise. That little bugger is like a pass key. I can get into Lizzie's life and into this place any time I want to.",
        "Alan: That's pretty bold talk coming from someone who just lost their business, their credit cards, and if they're not careful, they could lose a lot more.",
        "Jonathan: You want to throw around threats. I'm done with that. See, I have nothing to lose.",
        "Alan: Except Tammy.",
        "Jonathan: You come after me and Tammy again, I'm going to hit you where it hurts. I'm not talking about the bank account. I'm talking about Lizzie and the baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie Gatschet and Marcy Rylan, \"Inside The Light.\" Like me, Tammy is a fool, but in a good way. How much trouble she causes. I really like that. I think Tammy likes to see the best in everybody. I enjoy how much trouble she is. See Tammy and Lizzie, Wednesday, July 12, \"Inside The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: You seem to really enjoy that cigar.",
        "Jonathan: I enjoy making a stink, yeah.",
        "Alan: You know, I admire your cool composure. It takes a lot of nerve to come into a man's home and challenge him.",
        "Jonathan: Well, good. Glad we understand each other.",
        "Alan: I can certainly understand your urge to fight for the woman you love.",
        "Jonathan: I would use anyone or anything to make sure that Tammy was happy and safe.",
        "Alan: You're starting to sound like a Spaulding.",
        "Jonathan: Now I'm insulted.",
        "Alan: Let me ask you a question: How happy is Tammy going to be when you're going after another woman, especially a woman who's carrying your child?",
        "Jonathan: It's not a problem. I'm just using Lizzie to get to you. You see, you closed down Outskirts, you cancelled my credit, you screwed up Tammy's tuition, and you threatened me with a whole lot more. I think total war is what you called it? So, if you want to keep firing off shots, that's fine. I'm going to fire off a few shots, too. And if Lizzie and that kid end up as collateral damage, oh, well.",
        "Alan: You'll never win Elizabeth over. She hates you.",
        "Jonathan: Oh? Well, I got her to go to bed with me that one time, remember? Why don't you ask her how much she hated that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Roxy, we have got to talk. Jonathan is up to something. Yeah, I know, like that's something new. But, seriously, that guy would not bring me flowers unless he had a really good reason. He did say that getting along with me makes Tammy happy. But I just feel like there has got to be more to it than that. Whatever it was, it was kind of cool to see him stand up to granddad like that. Not that I need defending, but sometimes it's kind of nice. Roxy? Roxy? Roxy! Sweetie, where are you? Roxy?",
        "Dr. Baker: Lose something, or should I say someone?",
        "Lizzie: Roxy, come here, baby, come to mommy. Thank you.",
        "Dr. Baker: I found her wandering down the hall, looking a little lost.",
        "Lizzie: This place is kind of big. Sometimes she runs off and doesn't know where she is headed.",
        "Dr. Baker: That happens to the best of us sometimes. Do you prefer Lizzie or Elizabeth?",
        "Lizzie: Lizzie.",
        "Dr. Baker: My name is Steven Baker, but Steve, please. I've been looking forward to meeting you, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: You have? Well, this is me, and thanks for bringing Roxy back.",
        "Dr. Baker: You really love your dog, don't you?",
        "Lizzie: Of course I do, why? Who are you?",
        "Dr. Baker: I couldn't help noticing how concerned you were for her. You called her baby. Do you feel that way about your real baby, Lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: Look, I'm sorry, I'm really beat.",
        "Dr. Baker: It's nothing to be ashamed of, Lizzie, feeling more affection for a pet than a child. A lot of my clients feel the same way.",
        "Lizzie: Clients?",
        "Dr. Baker: Patients, if you prefer.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, you're a shrink. Wow!",
        "Dr. Baker: Lizzie, there's nothing to get upset about. Your grandfather thought you and I should get to know each other a little better.",
        "Lizzie: Out, out, get out now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: What is going on here?",
        "Clerk: This woman physically attacked me.",
        "Tammy: She is flipping out over nothing.",
        "Josh: This lady called the police --",
        "Tammy: That stupid check was not my fault.",
        "Cassie: What check?",
        "Clerk: The one she bounced.",
        "Tammy: She is nuts.",
        "Clerk: Be quiet.",
        "Tammy: You be quiet.",
        "Officer: Okay, okay.",
        "Remy: I would like to get a statement from the accused.",
        "Cassie: She is not a criminal.",
        "Tammy: That's what I said.",
        "Remy: Shouldn't you get a statement from me, first?",
        "Remy: Don't worry, we'll get down to the bottom of this. Step this way, miss.",
        "Tammy: I thought you were my friend. But no, you brought me over here to grill me.",
        "Remy: If I weren't here, you would be headed downtown right now. So chill, okay?",
        "Remy: Tammy, what is up with this, passing bad checks and starting a fight?",
        "Tammy: I told you the stupid check was not my fault.",
        "Remy: The point is, not that long ago the worst thing you did was return a library book a day late.",
        "Tammy: Not that long ago, is that code for before I met Jonathan? Jonathan has nothing to do with this. Okay, he is involved, but that's only because Alan Spaulding put him on his hit list.",
        "Josh: Whoa, whoa, whoa, listen to me. It's going to be fine. Trust me. I have complete faith that Remy is going to do right by Tammy. He's one of the good guys.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: ( Yelling ) We're good.",
        "Could: Could you all celebrate a little more quietly?",
        "Reva: I'm better.",
        "Colin: I said it looks good.",
        "Reva: It's a start, though, right?",
        "Colin: All I can tell you, Reva, is that right now it doesn't appear that the cancer is spreading.",
        "Billy: I call that major.",
        "Reva: I call it a miracle. Not that I was giving up hope --",
        "Colin: Reva, this is not over. There will be more tests and --",
        "Reva: I know, I know. But at least it feels like I'm taking, you know, some steps forward, instead of taking all these steps backwards.",
        "Colin: Fair enough.",
        "Reva: I wish you'd gotten drunker. What about the experimental procedure?",
        "Colin: It is total recall with the stem cell rescue--",
        "Reva: I know what it is. Do you think I'm going to need it?",
        "Colin: I don't want to rule it out, but as I say, at the moment, your condition looks encouraging.",
        "Billy: Encouraging. From him, that's like you're golden.",
        "Reva: I want to go right back out the door and I want to go out and celebrate.",
        "Colin: No, I don't think that's wise.",
        "Reva: I do. Come on, what I'm feeling right now, I want to get out of this place. This place isn't big enough for what's going through me right now. I want to go outside and count the stars and eat ice cream. Two big scoops. I want to bay at the moon.",
        "Billy: I'm your man. Let's go.",
        "Reva: Come on, Doc, come on, my boys, let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Baker: I understand you've been feeling a little depressed lately.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, depressed? Let's see, I was just left standing at the altar by the man that I love. And I found out that the baby I'm carrying is fathered by a psycho because of one stupid night together. What right do I have to be depressed?",
        "Alan: Well, I see you've met Dr. Baker, Elizabeth.",
        "Lizzie: He prefers Steve. This is so not what I need right now.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, you are pregnant, and you were on the rooftop of the hospital...",
        "Lizzie: That was not a call for help. It wasn't. That was a stunt to get Coop to come rescue me so he remembers how much he loves me.",
        "Dr. Baker: Delusion and depression often go hand-in- hand. What you did really was a cry for help, Lizzie.",
        "Alan: The doctor is right. We think it is best if you stay here for a few days and work with Dr. Baker.",
        "Dr. Baker: I am confident we can prevent this depression from spiraling into something much darker and more destructive to your baby.",
        "Lizzie: You want to see darker and more destructive? Because if you lock me up here for a couple of days, that's exactly what you're going to get.",
        "Alan: It would be better to be treated here than someplace else.",
        "Lizzie: You wouldn't send me to that place, the hospital that daddy went to.",
        "Dr. Baker: We'd hate to have to, Lizzie.",
        "Alan: We're only thinking of the baby.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, sure. Okay. Um, we don't always agree on everything, but I know that you love me. So I'll do it.",
        "Alan: That's my girl.",
        "Dr. Baker: I see progress already. Let's let this girl have a good night sleep. We'll have our first session bright and early in the morning.",
        "Alan: Absolutely. Sweet dreams, sweetheart. Sweet dreams.",
        "Lizzie: Baby, we have got to get out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clerk: Officer, why isn't she in handcuffs?",
        "Remy: Ma'am, please, everything's under control. In fact, you can go home. We'll call for more information. I'll deal with Ms. Winslow.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, man, you busting my girlfriend for being way too hot?",
        "Remy: It is a serious offense, but I'll let it slide this time.",
        "Tammy: Thank you.",
        "Remy: I'll see you around. Take it easy.",
        "Jonathan: Easy. What was that about?",
        "Josh: Remy, hang on for a second.",
        "Cassie: Could Tammy really be in trouble?",
        "Remy: Yeah, well, I do have to write a report, but I'm going to say upon investigation, the charges proved to be unfounded.",
        "Cassie: You're a good friend, Remy.",
        "Remy: This I can take care of. One thing I can't fix is Jonathan.",
        "Josh: You okay?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I'm fine. I'm a little cold. I think I should head home.",
        "Josh: The night is young. My jacket's inside. I'll get it for you.",

        "Billy: Hey. What we've got here is a lot better than that recycled stuff in the clinic.",
        "Reva: Yup, that's for sure.",
        "Colin: I should have brought the insect repellent.",
        "Reva: What's a few mosquitoes, doc, we're alive.",
        "Colin: Reva, honestly...",
        "Reva: Would you please tell Dr. Doom and Gloom, Billy that I am well enough to go home.",
        "Billy: She certainly thinks she is.",
        "Reva: What's up with that? You're supposed to be my cheerleader. My diagnosis is officially encouraging, and I'll be even better once I get home to Joshua. Oh, I don't believe it.",
        "Colin: What?",
        "Reva: It's an ice cream vendor. Who says you don't get what you wish for? Cones all around? My treat.",
        "Colin: She is something.",
        "Billy: Yeah. Look, she's still not herself. She tries to hide it, but I can see it.",
        "Colin: That's not exactly the tone I expected to hear from her designated cheerleader.",
        "Billy: Doc, it's just you and me. How do you see her?",
        "Colin: She's so determined to go home, she's almost made a believer out of me.",
        "Billy: But you're not?",
        "Colin: She needs to stay at the clinic until we're sure.",
        "Billy: She needs to stay, that's doable, but I'm going to need your help. I'm going to need your... hold on a second. ( Cell phone rings ) Oh. Hello. Hello? Cassie, is that you?",
        "Cassie: Yes, hi, Billy. I was trying to reach Reva. You obviously got to her first.",
        "Billy: Oh, yeah, I'm just visiting.",
        "Cassie: Uh-huh. And where are you guys?",
        "Billy: Believe it or not we're in a park right now. But Reva's good. She's real good. I'm taking real good care of her.",
        "Cassie: That's good.",
        "Billy: How's everything with you?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I'm missing my sister, and Josh is missing her, too. What city did you say that park was in?",
        "Billy: Sweetie, I've got to go. I'll talk to you later, bye.",
        "Cassie: Hello, Billy? Hello.",
        "Josh: Here you go.",
        "Cassie: Ah...",
        "Josh: Who you talking to?",
        "Cassie: Well, I tried to call Reva, but, um...",
        "Josh: But what?",
        "Cassie: Billy answered the phone.",
        "Josh: Billy's with Reva, that's lovely. He swore to me up and down he was just going to take her to the airport. So that means both of them are lying to me.",
        "Cassie: I'm sorry.",
        "Josh: Don't be sorry. It's not your fault, it's not your problem. We shouldn't let this mess up our celebration. H.B. would want us to celebrate, so we should do that. Come on, I'll buy you a drink.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: I probably shouldn't have answered that.",
        "Colin: How long do you and Reva think you can keep her stay at a cancer clinic from her own family.",
        "Billy: That depends on whether or not she is at the clinic.",
        "Colin: I'm not following you.",
        "Billy: Reva needs fresh air and a normal life just as much as she needs the treatment. With your permission, I was hoping I could put her up some place off the clinic's grounds and some place normal, and then I'll bring her in for treatment.",
        "Colin: I suppose that is doable for now --",
        "Billy: Whoa, whoa, for now, that's terrific. For now works.",
        "Reva: Here we go. That's a long walk.",
        "Billy: Well, look at you. You didn't get any on yourself.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well...",
        "Colin: You know, I need that.",
        "Reva: Yeah. You know, when I was waiting in line for these, I looked up at the stars, and I had the strongest feeling that Josh was so close by -- closer than he has been since my first prognosis, diagnosis, whatever, and I take that as a good sign.",
        "Billy: Sweetie, you've got more work to do here, but I'm going to stay right here with you, okay?",
        "Reva: Colin said I couldn't go home so fast, didn't he? You should go home to Springfield, Billy.",

        "Bruno: I was framed.",
        "Alan: Fine, fine. Um, I may be needing your special talents. You know that young man that was just in here, Jonathan Randall? He doesn't frighten easily. You may have to teach him a lesson the hard way.",

        "Tammy: Let's just go, okay.",
        "Jonathan: Hold on, before we leave, tell me what happened in there.",
        "Tammy: Nothing.",
        "Jonathan: Then why was there a cop around?",
        "Tammy: There are always cops in there.",
        "Jonathan: Well, Remy looked like he was working. Paid an awful lot of attention to you.",

        "Jonathan: Relax, relax, it was with flowers. For Lizzie. It was -- I went over there and made a peace offering. I played nice, I smiled a lot.",
        "Tammy: Are you serious?",
        "Jonathan: Uh-huh. You told me to go mano to mano with Alan, but play right in his hands, so I listened. I heard you. It was good advice, so I took a different path.",
        "Tammy: Amazing.",
        "Jonathan: Come here.",
        "Tammy: You come here. ( Cell phone rings ) You going to answer it?",

        "Lizzie: Are you ready for this, my granddad has me locked up in my room, and he sicced a shrink on me. He's actually insane.",
        "Jonathan: You have to chill out.",
        "Lizzie: I don't think you understand what I'm saying. I'm locked in my room. I need you.",
        "Jonathan: What are you calling me for?",
        "Lizzie: Look, I need someone who is not afraid of my grandfather. I saw the way you stood up to him. Please help me. You said that you would help me. You're the only one that can.",
