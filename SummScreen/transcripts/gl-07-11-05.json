        "Dinah: ( Sighs ) Okay, little boy-or girl-to-be, let's check the temperature. 99.5 warm and toasty degrees. Very good. Very good. Okay, so nine months from now, after daddy's contribution, there'll be a little baby popping up just in time for spring in beautiful Springfield. Good. Very good. Hi. Unbelievable. Perfect timing.",
        "Edmund: And you're unbelievable, period. What the hell is going on, Dinah? From what I hear, Cassie's proceeding full steam with her plan to accuse me of kidnapping you.",
        "Dinah: Okay, which I am about to go take care of right now, okay? You just stay right here.",
        "Edmund: For how long?",
        "Dinah: Just relax. Pour yourself a drink, and before long, I will be back, mission accomplished, okay? And then we can seal the agreement.",
        "Edmund: All right, Dinah. What if it takes longer than you expect to track down Cassie?",
        "Dinah: Trust me. I'm motivated.",
        "Edmund: Dinah. Dinah, if you cut...",
        "Dinah: Trust me. I'm highly motivated.",

        "Cassie: Jude and Zach's invitation was the last, so we are done. We are done.",
        "Jeffrey: How many was that?",
        "Cassie: 23?",
        "Jeffrey: And how many kids does that make?",
        "Cassie: 31?",
        "Jeffrey: Wow.",
        "Cassie: I'm so glad to be thinking about something else besides Edmund and the whole custody mess.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. And your new secret weapon?",
        "Cassie: Dinah. I can't believe that my future, my baby's future, lies in her hands.",
        "Jeffrey: Just breathe. Relax.",
        "Cassie: I'm trying.",
        "Jeffrey: Can I do anything to help?",
        "Cassie: You tell me.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I do know something. Something that's very soothing...",
        "Cassie: Nice.",
        "Jeffrey: ...Very warm...",
        "Cassie: Even better.",
        "Jeffrey: ...And bubbly.",
        "Cassie: Bubbly?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: ( Laughs )",
        "Jeffrey: Come on. I'm sure Rick and Mel won't mind. Look. Look, they even left a robe for you. What considerate hosts.",
        "Cassie: We weren't invited.",
        "Jeffrey: A technicality.",
        "Cassie: I don't have a suit.",
        "Jeffrey: So? Neither do I.",
        "Cassie: ( Laughs ) This is why you were so hot on dropping off that invitation, huh?",
        "Jeffrey: Just the party. It's all about the party.",
        "Cassie: Right. All about the party.",

        "Marina: ( Sighs ) I am never going to remember all this, Danny.",
        "Danny: Why?",
        "Marina: If I don't pass this...",
        "Danny: Oh, of course you will. You'll qualify for the academy. I mean, how many Coopers have done exactly the same thing?",
        "Marina: Which is going to make it even worse when I tank.",
        "Danny: Don't say that. Ooh. What have we got here? Come on. Let me see your stuff.",
        "Marina: Now?",
        "Danny: Yeah. Cuff me.",
        "Marina: Danny, no. I'm so bad at handcuffing. Believe me. I'm a total spaz.",
        "Danny: Why don't you just let me be the judge of that? Come on. What are you, scared?",
        "Marina: You asked for it.",

        "Harley: Okay, what is going on out there? He should have been processed and released by now.",
        "Mallet: He was.",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Mallet: The bad news is, Gus is gone.",
        "Harley: How is that possible? He would have to walk past here after they processed his bail.",
        "Mallet: He used the back exit I don't know. He's not in the building. I checked.",
        "Harley: So we have to get to Gus and we've got to warn him.",
        "Mallet: Don't worry about it. Don't panic. I've got everything under control.",
        "Harley: Except Alan. Anybody who's going to kill their own offspring, that's an anger management problem, don't you think?",
        "Mallet: Oh, you think?",
        "Harley: And if he gets an idea that Gus knew anything about this, he's going to go after him. I just know it.",

        "Gus: How are you doing, Alan? You here all alone with your memories?",
        "Alan: You should know. You're the one who sent me the invitation. I'm a little early. I hope that doesn't ruin your plan.",
        "Gus: Plan?",
        "Alan: Will there be any more guests?",
        "Gus: What guests?",
        "Alan: No? Just you and me, huh?",
        "Gus: Yeah. I... and since it is just you and me, maybe we should just get everything out on the table right now, you know? Considering I just got out of jail.",
        "Alan: Yes, I know. Congratulations.",
        "Gus: Yeah. And you know, since I left the jail, there's a beautiful cell over there now, going to waste. Beautiful. Perfect for you. Just your size.",
        "Alan: Sorry to ruin your plan. I'm not going to jail again, ever.",
        "Gus: You want to stay out of jail, Dad, you've got to stop threatening people like Buzz Cooper.",
        "Alan: How much did you tell him? How much does he know?",
        "Gus: It's not what I told him, it's what he told me.",
        "Alan: Oh, but of course. Alexandra and he have been as thick as thieves the past few months. I wonder who else she's told.",
        "Gus: I don't have any idea what you're talking about.",
        "Alan: You know, Gus, this is even beneath you, sending me an invitation, setting up the situation exactly the way it was the night Phillip, my son... the game is over. Now, I want you to tell me, who else knows? Now!",

        "Mallet: Great. That's all I needed to hear. Hurry, Officer. This way. Listen, they found Harley Cooper.",
        "Cop #1: What's going on?",
        "Mallet: Harley Cooper was spotted a couple of minutes ago in this building. We just got a report. You know who I'm talking about, right?",
        "Cop #1: Are you kidding?",
        "Mallet: Well, listen, they tracked her to this floor, and then she was spotted walking down this hallway, so I'll show you where, okay?",

        "Danny: Well, hold up. Hold up, Officer Speedy. Aren't you forgetting something?",
        "Marina: Where?",
        "Danny: The thing you need most to ace your practice exam? And it ain't no number-two pencil.",

        "Frank: Please come home, and I promise you I'll never let you get hurt again. Please. Yeah, right, that's going to happen. I don't even believe that myself.",
        "Rick: Hey.",
        "Frank: Rick, what the hell are you doing here?",
        "Rick: Oh, nice to see you, too, buddy. I saw the car parked out in front. I just wanted to see how you were doing.",

        "Rick: Frank, she's done this before. She's going to come back.",
        "Frank: Hey, Rick. This is the first time in my life that I don't know where the hell my sister is. When she was born, I was the one that made sure that she was okay all the time, okay? When we were little, I was the one who crawled in her crib and held her in my arms to protect her and keep her safe. Mom used to catch me all the time in there. I just wanted to make sure that she was okay.",
        "Rick: Of course you did. You're quite a team, you and Harley.",
        "Frank: Yeah, we were. When she comes back, who knows what we're going to be?",
        "Rick: She will. I've always envied the relationship that you and Harley have. Really. It's special. Don't get me wrong, I love my sister, but ever since my stepmother died and my father moved away, we just lost that connection. I mean, it'd be nice if she stayed in one place longer than five minutes so we can connect again, but I don't know, you know? Like father like daughter, I guess.",
        "Frank: Yeah. Look at us now, right? The two old reliables. Everybody knows where they can find us.",
        "Rick: Alone with no women.",
        "Frank: What are you doing here, anyway? I thought you had the night off. I mean, where were you headed?",
        "Rick: I did, Frankie, but I don't know.",
        "Frank: Hm? Don't know, I'm just driving around trying to decide if I need to go someplace... someplace that I have no desire to go to.",
        "Frank: Well, that sounds awfully mysterious.",
        "Rick: You know what? All I know, buddy, it's a beautiful night, and all I want to do is just drive home, fire up the Jacuzzi, and have a cold beer.",

        "Cassie: What is wrong with you? You don't sneak up on people like this.",
        "Dinah: I know, I'm sorry. I just saw the two of you in there all cozy and snuggly and splashing around, and it's... it's been a while since I've been able to slip into a hot tub, ever since I got pregnant.",

        "Jeffrey: Is everything okay?",
        "Dinah: Oh, I can't even believe that it's so difficult for me to lie, even if it's for the right reasons. It's about the kidnapping story.",
        "Cassie: \"Story\"?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. The fact that I told you guys that Edmund kidnapped me... I made the whole thing up.",
        "Cassie: Why?",
        "Dinah: I, um... I know that I told you I wanted to help you keep custody, but you guys, if I tell them about Edmund, that, you know, that I'd been lying about the fact that he kidnapped me, and that the truth comes out, I'm arrested, okay, and then I go to jail, and then I'm having a baby behind bars, which is not very good for me or that baby.",
        "Jeffrey: So you made up the story.",
        "Cassie: Why?",
        "Dinah: Attention? ( Laughs ) Attention? I don't know. Maybe it was the hormones. Look, the truth is that Edmund was being mean to me and I wanted to feel important. That's all.",
        "Cassie: Well. Without her, we don't have anything. We don't get Edmund. That's it.",
        "Dinah: Cassie, I meant what I said. You deserve to have custody, and I wish there was something I could do to help you.",
        "Cassie: Well, maybe you still can help, Dinah. Just maybe.",

        "Frank: Yeah, Dad keeps telling me that I did a great job raising Marina and Harley, but all I really wanted to raise were two nice, quiet, perfect housewives that like to cook and clean and raise their kids and watch soap operas.",
        "Rick: Yeah. Yeah. Sounds great, Frank, but it's not 1950 anymore. Women have careers. You know what's even more depressing than having to cook for myself and do my own laundry?",

        "Alan: Stop it. Stop it. I've got to think.",
        "Harley: Think about what? A story? A way out? It's too late, Alan. I know about Dr. Wallace. He told me everything before he died.",

        "Harley: Dr. Wallace. He told me. You were the one who shot Phillip.",

        "Rick: I'll meet you back at the house. Oh, Mel made this cheesecake, this delicious cheesecake. I'd like to come home to something other than an empty plate, big guy, okay? Save me a slice?",
        "Frank: Well, that's just not going to happen.",
        "Rick: Watch your cholesterol, big guy. You're as big as a horse, okay?",
        "Frank: I'm not as big as a horse. I'm as healthy as a horse, okay? And listen, when my sister comes back safe and sound, then I'll start looking after myself, okay?",
        "Rick: Okay.",
        "Frank: And you, I think you need to be careful as to what little adventure you're going to go off and do right now.",
        "Rick: It's not... I've just got to tie up a loose end. Or really nail somebody for a real stupid practical joke. So, anyway, I'll see you later.",
        "Frank: All right. Be careful.",
        "Rick: I will.",

        "Edmund: Dinah, no hostess abandons a guest without leaving some form of entertainment to keep them company. No, no, no. Interesting woman. Always has a secret hidden away for a rainy day, and I think it's storming. Stopwatch. Well. Locked. Now, what could that be?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Do you think it was easy for me to admit that I made up a story that Edmund was kidnapping me?",
        "Jeffrey: Just questioning your timing, here.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. You know, you could have told me all this when I came and asked for your help.",
        "Dinah: And I would have. I should have. I... I wanted to help you, and I've been trying to figure out a way to prove that to you. You know what? I think there still may be a way here. We're the only two people that know the truth, right?",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, and Edmund.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, but who is going to believe Edmund? If the both of you back me up and promise me that I'm not going to have any trouble with the cops, and I don't have to worry, then I will go ahead and swear that complaint like we had planned.",
        "Cassie: But that would be a lie, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: I don't care if it's a lie. The baby is at risk. You know, if we don't stop Edmund for good, he's going to twist things around and you're going to lose custody of that baby. Is that what you want? You can't possibly want that for your baby.",
        "Cassie: No, I do not want that.",
        "Dinah: Okay. Then let's get it done. And if I have to lie for the right reasons, then I'm going to do it.",
        "Jeffrey: It's a shame that lying comes so hard for you.",
        "Cassie: No. Uh-uh. No.",
        "Jeffrey: What is it?",
        "Cassie: No, we're not going to do that. We're not going to do that. No more lying, all right? We can't get away with this, you guys.",
        "Dinah: Then you tell me the alternative, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: I don't know. You just take care of yourself and keep yourself healthy, okay?",
        "Dinah: Cassie, listen to me.",
        "Cassie: No, I don't want to listen to anything you have to say right now. I don't. I just need some time to think about this, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: You think about it and you think away and you tell me what you want to do. Call me.",
        "Cassie: ( Sighs ) Oh, my god.",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie?",
        "Cassie: Now what? That was the best chance we had. What do we have left?",
        "Jeffrey: We'll think of something.",
        "Cassie: I want to keep my baby.",
        "Jeffrey: I know.",
        "Cassie: I guess to do that, I'm just going to have to make a really big sacrifice.",
        "Jeffrey: A big sacrifice?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I'm going to have to.",
        "Jeffrey: Are you talking about me?",
        "Cassie: I didn't mean you, and you know that. I want to be with you. I made my choice.",
        "Jeffrey: All right, let's get down to the business at hand, shall we? Now, Dinah lied about Edmund kidnapping her, so...",
        "Cassie: Doesn't matter. I saw Edmund that night. I saw the look in his eyes. He was going to hit her, the same way he hit you, and I don't want my child being raised around that, and I don't want to be threatened into going back to him or blackmailed into anything. And you know what else? He thinks he's winning. That's how he's feeling right now.",
        "Jeffrey: It doesn't matter how he feels. What's important is how you feel. Okay, this is one battle lost, okay? It doesn't mean we've lost the war.",
        "Cassie: You're damn right it doesn't mean we've lost the war, because this has just begun.",

        "Edmund: Present and accounted for.",
        "Dinah: Come here.",
        "Edmund: Did you tell Cassie I didn't kidnap you?",
        "Dinah: Yes. You can ask her yourself. I'm sure you'll hear everything that you want to hear. If you can understand her, in between the sobs.",
        "Edmund: She was upset?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. So why don't you take the good news like a man and just start kissing me right now?",
        "Edmund: Well, a promise is...",
        "Dinah: Yeah, a promise is. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.",
        "Edmund: What? A technique critique?",
        "Dinah: Oh, no. No, no. No complaints so far. I'm just wondering, how adventurous are you?",
        "Edmund: Depends on what you have in mind.",
        "Dinah: Well, if I told you that, that would pretty much spoil the surprise, wouldn't it, and the thrill? I want you just to trust me, okay? Put yourself in my hands tonight and you will not regret it. I promise.",

        "Remy: Well, you finished before anyone else. That's a good sign.",
        "Marina: We'll see.",
        "Remy: What was that all about?",
        "Marina: I don't know. He keeps giving me these looks.",

        "Marina: I don't know. Maybe he and my dad have something at the station.",

        "Marina: What?",
        "Remy: Okay, when that guy kind of gave you a hard time, were you with Danny?",
        "Marina: Yeah, but what does that have to do with anything?",
        "Remy: Listen, you're trying to pin down a job with the pd. They look at you really hard. They want to know who they're getting, you know?",
        "Marina: Okay. So, what am I missing?",

        "Alan: No. No, no, no, no. This gun stimulates good conversation and honesty.",
        "Gus: Listen, if dr. Wallace lied to Harley, well, then everything's fine. You got nothing to worry about, nothing to fear.",
        "Alan: Nothing to fear? Gus, you two want me to hang for something I didn't do!",
        "Harley: We want justice! That's all.",
        "Alan: You know what justice is for you, Harley? Justice would be to see me behind a cell permanently. You want revenge, that's what you want.",
        "Gus: Listen to yourself. Does that make any sense? Revenge? You're the one who's ripping her life to pieces, right? Why? Because you won't stand up and face what you did.",
        "Alan: I'll tell you what i didn't do. I didn't kill my son.",

        "Harley: You don't think we're the only two who know what happened.",
        "Alan: Who else knows?",
        "Harley: Mallet's been helping me this whole time. He knows everything. So you see, you can buy up all the papers, you can buy up the TV stations, you can spend every last dime you have, but it will still end up on the cover of the tabloids. It will end up in all the web sites, and it won't be long before everyone in this town has seen some copy of the note that Wallace wrote saying that you shot Phillip.",
        "Alan: Lies!",
        "Harley: Alex, Lizzie, Beth, Emma, jams, Zach. Your whole family is going to know. Everybody you work with, everybody in the country will know that you shot your own son in cold blood, the son that you swore that you would sacrifice everything for. This was the son that you said meant more to you than anything else in the world. Turns out he couldn't have meant less.",
        "Alan: That's not true!",
        "Harley: You didn't care at all about your son!",

        "Marina: Well, Danny is not a part of that life anymore.",
        "Remy: I'm just saying. That cop threw some attitude at you and Danny. That might not mean anything, but who knows?",
        "Marina: To hell with them, Remy. I like Danny and I want to be a cop. So I don't plan on changing anything.",
        "Remy: Even if...",
        "Marina: I mean, it's their loss, right? If they can't handle who I am or who I love, then it's out of my hands, and there's nothing I can do about it.",
        "Remy: Okay.",

        "Cassie: I won't lose this baby to Edmund. I won't. I already had to give up Will and I'm not even close to dealing with that yet.",
        "Jeffrey: You're Will's mother, okay? You talk to him every day.",
        "Cassie: It's not the same. It's not like this baby's going to make up for it or take his place. And, you know... and I'm not going to let Edmund blackmail me. That just leaves me with one more option. ( Sighs )",
        "Jeffrey: What?",
        "Cassie: I don't want to say anything because I don't want to jinx it, but I really need to get going.",
        "Jeffrey: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Okay. Whatever it is that you plan to do, just promise me one thing: That it's not dangerous.",

        "Edmund: Just a little bit sharper. I think that's fantastic. I think that's a great-- ooh-- idea. But Dinah, I think... I think... I think I need a little music to get me in the mood.",

        "Harley: No. Just the truth.",
        "Alan: The truth is, I loved Phillip more than anything. Of all of my children, he was the one I was the most proud of. He was very special.",
        "Gus: Yeah, he was.",
        "Alan: But he lost his way. He became very confused and turned around. Sometimes that happens, you know? I'm the head of a company, the head of a family, and he began to threaten and strike out to those that tried to reach out and get close to him.",
        "Harley: He had to be stopped.",
        "Alan: Yes. He told me that he would leave me with nothing. I couldn't allow him to destroy everything that I had worked for all of my life. He was going to take the children, the future of Spaulding, and leave me here all alone. I had to do it. I had to do it to save the family, to save myself. And I pulled the trigger. And he fell on the ground. I saw him just as he was when he was a child.",
        "Gus: Dad, listen to me. Listen to me.",
        "Alan: No! No. I'm tired of listening. I'm tired of talking. So you know everything now, don't you? Well, guess what? You're not going to hurt me with that information. You're not going to turn me in. Never. Never! Never! ( Gunshot ) _Next, on \"Guiding Llight.\" _",
