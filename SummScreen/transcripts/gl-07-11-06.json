        "Buzz: Well, we could do this a couple of ways.",
        "Olivia: Okay.",
        "Buzz: Frank knows. He knows about... the kiss. And more importantly, he knows what was behind it. So... that's where I think we should start.",
        "Olivia: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Buzz: Oh, geez. Who'd have thought you and me would end up here?",
        "Olivia: No, not me, not me. So what are we going to do?",
        "Buzz: Frank says I should go for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Hey. So, you and Olivia had a talk?",
        "Ava: I guess you could call it that. Frank, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cause you guys, you and Buzz, any problems. I just... I'm just so sick of this garbage with...",
        "Frank: Ava. It's okay. You've got a very big heart, okay, and that's never, ever been a crime in my book. And I have to say that I admire and respect someone who does what they think is right, even if it doesn't turn out the way they want.",
        "Ava: Thanks. Still doesn't change the fact that Olivia thinks I'm on a mission to drive her away from the Cooper family.",
        "Frank: My God, woman, is that what you're doing?",
        "Ava: Frank, stop!",
        "Frank: (Laughs) Come on, I'm just kidding you.",
        "Coop: He may be kidding, but Ava, are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Remy: Who's there? Springfield PD!",
        "Marina: (Laughs) Right back at you, babe!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Excellent session, Doctor. I think that Elizabeth is starting to understand that she and the baby will be much safer here surrounded by her family.",
        "Dr. Baker: Absolutely. I really couldn't. Continue doing your good work, Alan. Fortune favors the believer.",
        "Alan: Thank you, Doctor. (Laughs)",
        "Beth: What was that all about?",
        "Alan: You know Dr. Baker.",
        "Beth: By reputation. What's he doing here?",
        "Alan: Helping us keep our baby safe in our home, Beth.",
        "Beth: Lizzie's baby.",
        "Alan: Yes, that's right.",
        "Beth: You brought a shrink here? Where is Lizzie?",
        "Alan: Home, safe and sound.",
        "Beth: By her own choice?",
        "Alan: She's with us. That's all that matters.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I don't think you understand. They've locked me in my room! You have to help me!",
        "Jonathan: Why call me?",
        "Lizzie: Because I need someone who isn't afraid of my grandfather. I saw the way you stood up to him tonight. Please, you have to help me. You said that you would. And you're the only one who can.",
        "Jonathan: Okay, I'll do you a favor, just this once.",
        "Lizzie: Really?",
        "Jonathan: I'll be right there.",
        "Tammy: So what's up with Lizzie?",
        "Jonathan: Oh, she's fine. But more importantly, I think I have Alan Spaulding on the run. Pretty soon, he'll be out of our lives for good. I hate to leave you.",
        "Tammy: What are you doing, Jonathan? These are the Spaulding's we're talking about.",
        "Jonathan: Don't worry, Chez Spaulding is not going to go up in flames anytime soon. I'm putting out fires now, just like you wanted me to.",
        "Tammy: All right, what's going on?",
        "Jonathan: I'm just going over there to talk about baby details with Lizzie. Because if her and I are on the same page, it just makes our life easier. (Laughs) What?",
        "Tammy: Promise me you are not making things worse for yourself.",
        "Jonathan: No, it's the opposite. If Lizzie's happy, then Alan's happy, and if Alan's happy, then he leaves us alone.",
        "Tammy: And we can have our lives back. Your bar, and our money, and college. And then when your baby is born...",
        "Jonathan: Can we just start with getting our lives back?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Frank gave his blessing for you and me, for... at least for me to try.",
        "Olivia: I just can't believe the two of you.",
        "Buzz: No, it's not like we're passing you back and forth.",
        "Olivia: No, that's not it. I mean, you walk away from me for him, now he's doing the same thing for you.",
        "Buzz: Either we're the two dumbest guys in the world, or we're the...",
        "Olivia: Or the two most amazing.",
        "Buzz: No, Frank's amazing, I'm not, I'm the one that... kissed his girl. For all these months, I mean, months, that I've been hoping...",
        "Olivia: Hoping for what? What do you want? Am I what you want?",
        "Buzz: Are you kidding? Are you what I want? I want to take you upstairs right now and shake the building so the chandelier comes down.",
        "Olivia: You don't have a chandelier.",
        "Buzz: That's not the point.",
        "Olivia: I know.",
        "Buzz: I... I've craved you, been craving you for... since before the Inn, and denying myself, and you're like a drug. I... feel alive for the first time, and I just want to hold you and never let you go.",
        "Olivia: Buzz...",
        "Buzz: I mean, I... I think I could handle you.",
        "Olivia: I think you could.",
        "Buzz: But it's not going to happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: I know it sounds totally stupid. Okay, it's completely my fault. I was just trying to protect everyone.",
        "Coop: Ava, what did you actually see between Olivia and pop?",
        "Ava: I just saw them kissing. That's it, and I assumed it was much more than that.",
        "Frank: I still think she did the right thing.",
        "Coop: Frank, you don't need to defend Ava to me. Believe me, I know that she doesn't have a hurtful bone in her entire body. Of all people, I think I would probably know that one the best. I know that anything she does, she always does for the best reasons.",
        "Ava: And I did it because I didn't want to cause any more problems for Buzz and Frank.",
        "Coop: I'm really sorry, Frank.",
        "Frank: It's all right, brother. It's all good, man. It's all good.",
        "Coop: You really should have seen this coming, though.",
        "Frank: You know, that's the point right there where you should quit while you're ahead, okay?",
        "Coop: Frank, I'm just saying... look, I'm just saying, it's dad and Olivia. All right, it always has been. And you... you know that. When two people are meant to be together, Frank, there's nothing you can do to fight it. When it comes down to it, love is always going to win.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Great. I know, I know. I can't come back to school! Alan's ruined my life there. He took all your money. Even money that you didn't have. (Sighs) We'll never get out of this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Oh, God, come on, Jonathan! Where are you? What is taking so long? (Knock at door)",
        "Lizzie: How'd you get past the... Mom!",
        "Beth: How'd I get past what?",
        "Lizzie: Granddad has me locked in here!",
        "Beth: Yeah, I got that.",
        "Lizzie: He... he's going to keep me prisoner in here until I deliver this baby. You have to help me.",
        "Beth: Okay, okay. I don't want to keep you locked up, and really, neither does your grandfather.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, tell that to his creepy shrink.",
        "Beth: Honey, I understand why you're upset. Why don't we... we'll go out, we'll talk about it, we'll have some mother-daughter times, we'll buy some things for the baby.",
        "Lizzie: This baby doesn't need any more things. What I need is some time to myself without having someone hovering over me!",
        "Alan: I wouldn't hover, Elizabeth, if you would agree to keep yourself safe.",
        "Lizzie: Deal. I won't join the marines. Can I go?",
        "Alan: I mean stay away from Jonathan Randall.",
        "Lizzie: Whatever. Okay, I'll do whatever you want. Just give me my freedom back.",
        "Beth: Oh... good, good. Honey, just do what your grandfather says. (Whispers) Just... for a little while.",
        "Lizzie: You know, Granddad, you're right. Being back here in my old room is nicer than I thought it would be.",
        "Alan: I'm glad to hear you say that. It is very smart. Besides, who can take care of you better than your mother and me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: You don't have to help me with that. Stop, it's not even your shift.",
        "Coop: I'm not helping as a waiter. I'm helping as a...",
        "Ava: As a... as a what?",
        "Coop: I was going to say boyfriend. But it sounded a bit lame considering everything that you and I have been through.",
        "Ava: How about... paramour?",
        "Coop: Paramour?",
        "Ava: Yeah.",
        "Coop: That sounds a bit dignified.",
        "Ava: Sig ot?",
        "Coop: No, that's way too internetty. Don't ever say it again.",
        "Ava: (Laughs) Okay, how about this. How about I just call you \"loverboy.\" And then in public I can scream, \"Hey, loverboy!\"",
        "Coop: Shh.",
        "Ava: (Laughs) Is that too much for you?",
        "Coop: Might be just a bit. Over the top drama queen, geez.",
        "Ava: So let me ask you a question.",
        "Coop: Hmm?",
        "Ava: Did you really mean what you said? That you believe people are destined to be together?",
        "Coop: Well, up until recently, I believed in the many flowers, many bees theory.",
        "Ava: Oh, okay...",
        "Coop: Not fate. I know, I know.",
        "Ava: Cross pollination?",
        "Coop: Cross pollination, yes. No fates, no destinies, you know, no plans of action. Just you're with the person at the right time. But I'm not so sure anymore, you know? Because, I mean, if this... this right here isn't meant to be, Ava, I don't know what is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Remy: I still can't believe you came down here alone at night.",
        "Marina: Excuse me. I'm a cop.",
        "Remy: Excuse me, you're a girl in a bikini.",
        "Marina: I had to get away from Company. At least for a little bit. It's too tense there.",
        "Remy: That's weird. Coopers are usually pretty mellow.",
        "Marina: Yeah, well, we were until my dad and my grandpa fell for the same woman.",
        "Remy: Olivia? She's dating Frank, right?",
        "Marina: Yeah, but there is something going on between her and my grandpa. You can tell whenever they're in the same room together. So I just try to stay out of the same room. Too much energy. And I'm trying not to have an opinion about it.",
        "Remy: But you do.",
        "Marina: No. If Olivia isn't madly in love with my dad, she should just let him go. You know my dad, he's an all or nothing kind of guy. Besides, he deserves to have someone 100% totally in love with him.",
        "Remy: Guess that's what we all want, right?",
        "Marina: Oh, not me. I am 100% done with love. Finished.",
        "Remy: (Laughs)",
        "Marina: What are you laughing at?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Hey!",
        "Olivia: You're just scared.",
        "Buzz: Scared? I'm terrified.",
        "Olivia: Since when?",
        "Buzz: Since it almost cost me my son.",
        "Olivia: But it didn't. There's a list of reasons why we can't be together. I hurt Frank. I lied to you about breaking up with him because you're just as much to blame in all of this as I am, and you can't stand to look at your own face in the mirror, let alone mine.",
        "Buzz: That's a start.",
        "Olivia: Buzz, you wanted me first.",
        "Buzz: So?",
        "Olivia: So?! So you're great with my kid.",
        "Buzz: I'm good with everybody's kids.",
        "Olivia: You started delivering take-out orders to my room personally.",
        "Buzz: Yes, I did! Well?",
        "Olivia: You came to my room at the Inn that night.",
        "Buzz: I know all this! Does it amount to a hill of beans? No! You're hurt because of Frank. But how is this going to work?",
        "Olivia: I don't know. I don't know, maybe it can, Buzz! Maybe it can!",
        "Buzz: How is it going to work? My name isn't Lewis or Spaulding. I don't have that kind of money. You want that, and I'm not even...",
        "Olivia: No, no, I don't need that any... I don't know! Maybe, maybe, but I just...",
        "Buzz: But what? But nothing. All I've got is this. All I got is this restaurant and my family. And if this restaurant burns down tomorrow, I could care less. But my family, I would walk through a fire for, I would take a bullet for. I wouldn't dodge it, I'd take it.",
        "Olivia: Is that what I am? I'm a bullet?",
        "Buzz: You are a bullet straight through my son's heart and he's lying down on the ground, bleeding. So is that... the grounds on which we're going to build a relationship between us? Is it?",
        "Olivia: No. It's not going to work.",
        "Buzz: Yeah.",
        "Olivia: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Is... anyone else chilly? I think I... felt a draft.",
        "Alan: Chilly? Elizabeth, it's the middle of the summer. (Laughs)",
        "Lizzie: Granddad. Sometimes I get the chills. Do you mind? I'm pregnant.",
        "Alan: Whatever you say, dear. (Knocks)",
        "Beth: Excuse me. Oh... you'll excuse me, there's something that I need to attend to. You get your rest, and I will be back in a bit.",
        "Lizzie: Mom. I'm a little tired if you don't mind.",
        "Alan: Oh sure, I can leave you to your privacy, Elizabeth. I'm sure you'll rest a lot nicer knowing that Jonathan Randall is far, far away. (Door closes)",
        "Lizzie: The window? The window.",
        "Jonathan: Well, how else do you want me to get in?",
        "Lizzie: Okay, well how am I supposed to get out?!",
        "Jonathan: Whoa. How about, \"Hey, Jonathan, thank you for coming, you're my hero.\" Because if you want, I'll crawl back down.",
        "Lizzie: No, no, Jonathan, no!",
        "Jonathan: Ooh, scream my name out at the top of your lungs, why don't you.",
        "Lizzie: Look, I'm sorry, okay? I'm just desperate. Don't leave.",
        "Jonathan: All right, but it's only because I like my women desperate.",
        "Lizzie: Is it... going to be safe? I mean, I'm...",
        "Jonathan: I know. Come on.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. All right. Don't squeeze too tight.",
        "Jonathan: Okay.",
        "Lizzie: And don't cop a feel.",
        "Jonathan: (Laughs) Yeah, right.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. And whatever you do... don't drop me. Okay... Roxy. Roxy. Psst, come here.",
        "Jonathan: (Laughs)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Tammy! What a nice surprise.",
        "Tammy: I'm sorry to bother you, Beth. But your husband and my boyfriend are starting a war that will only hurt Lizzie and the baby. I came over here to see if you and I could try to stop that from happening.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Okay. Punch it. (Car starts)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie Gatschet, \"Inside The Light.\" They're hot. There's no denying it, I mean, the chemistry! People! You know, it's electric. It's unbelievable. But I believe it. (Laughs) I'm not going to keep going. Tom's a fool. (Laughs) Don't tell anybody. Stephanie Gatschet, \"Inside The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: If you're trying to freak me out on purpose, it's working. Okay, I'm a pregnant woman in a speeding car with a known psycho.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, you called me, babe.",
        "Lizzie: Just tell me where we're going.",
        "Jonathan: What do you care? You're free. Sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.",
        "Lizzie: I'm going to jump out of the car.",
        "Jonathan: Well, better warn the baby first.",
        "Lizzie: You're such a jerk.",
        "Jonathan: Would you shut up and let me drive?",
        "Lizzie: Me shut up? You shut up!",
        "Jonathan: Ooh, good one. Good one. We're going around the lake. That's where we're going. There's a new restaurant there. I'm going to get you a nice meal. Then I'm going to drop you off and let you call someone who cares.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, you couldn't have just said that the first time I asked you. You have to be difficult, do you think it's funny... (rumbling car noises)",
        "Jonathan: Aw, no! No, no, not now!",
        "Lizzie: What not now? Do not tell me this... that's great.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Tammy, have a seat. Can I have someone bring you something?",
        "Tammy: No, thank you. You know I was thinking, you and I have something in common.",
        "Beth: Oh?",
        "Tammy: We're both with guys who don't exactly follow the rules to get what they want. And right now, they're going after each other. It is not good.",
        "Beth: No, I suppose it's not.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan will fight Alan with everything he has. I don't have to tell you how ugly that could get.",
        "Beth: So, you came here to...",
        "Tammy: Appeal to you as a woman and a mother. This is all about the baby.",
        "Beth: Does this mean that Jonathan wants to be a part of the baby's life?",
        "Tammy: He won't admit it yet, but I think he will.",
        "Beth: Oh.",
        "Tammy: And I think he deserves that chance.",
        "Beth: You do.",
        "Tammy: He's the father.",
        "Alan: Beth, have you well, Tammy. I assume that Jonathan sent you.",
        "Tammy: No, sir.",
        "Alan: No, sir. Did you hear that, Beth? Raised as a royal, should count for something. I appreciate your manner, Tammy, but I don't want you here.",
        "Tammy: It's ok, I came to talk to Beth.",
        "Alan: Did you?",
        "Beth: Alan, it's alright, Tammy and I were just having a little girl talk. Would you like to join us?",
        "Alan: No, thank you. But you can give Jonathan a message from me. Tell him I plan to squeeze harder.",
        "Tammy: So we're on the same team here?",
        "Beth: First of all, Tammy, this isn't a game. You and your homicidal boyfriend will stay away from my daughter and her baby, or whatever Alan does to you will be a day at the ballet compared to what I'll do to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: I'll handle this. (Car beeping) Ow!",
        "Lizzie: Are you okay?",
        "Jonathan: Mm-hmm. I just need a minute.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Hello, can I get a tall mocha decaf cap double shot, no foam... oh. (Groans) Leave room for the milk.",
        "Ava: So tall mocha decaf double shot cap... hold the what?",
        "Olivia: Just forget it. Make it a double espresso. I'm feeling bitter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Excuse me, why is left always your left?",
        "Coop: Because left is left.",
        "Buzz: No, I'm in the front. Left is my left.",
        "Coop: Oh, is that right?",
        "Buzz: Why are you insisting on doing all the heavy lifting today?",
        "Coop: Well, I just ran into Frank.",
        "Buzz: Oh, he told you.",
        "Coop: Yeah, he told me.",
        "Buzz: Well, I'm not going to make any excuses. I could make a lot of excuses-- you know, blame it on Olivia, blame it on my horoscope, but the truth is I pulled a Jimmy Carter, I left it in my heart. Is there anything wrong with that, no, as long as you keep it in your heart. You know I liked that president.",
        "Coop: What?",
        "Buzz: All I'm saying is that...",
        "Coop: Can I get a word in...",
        "Buzz: No, all I'm saying is that Frank is hurt for good reason, Ava looks like I've killed her puppy, I'm miserable, Olivia's miserable, everybody's miserable!",
        "Coop: Okay. Okay, why don't you just have a seat here, all right?",
        "Buzz: Why?",
        "Coop: Because now it's my turn to take a shot at you, that's why.",
        "Buzz: Oh, wonderful. You know, Olivia was just here. I sent her packing. And I'm not ashamed to admit, I watched her walk away, and watching her walk away the way she walks, well... oh. And... and I said to myself, \"What the hell did you just do?\"",
        "Coop: That's a good question.",
        "Buzz: What do you mean?",
        "Coop: Well, you know what the problem is with this family?",
        "Buzz: There's only one?",
        "Coop: Okay. Everyone is so pig-headed, they never learn anything. They are so pig-headed that they feel like they have to do the right thing all the time. It's like you either do the right thing or you die.",
        "Buzz: I was late for the \"Do the Right Thing\" class. What are you talking about?",
        "Coop: Pop... don't be a fool, all right? Just go after her.",
        "Buzz: You know, when people say, \"I hate to say I told you so,\" they don't mean \"I hate to say I told you so.\" They love to say \"I told you so.\" They're just preparing to rub your nose into something.",
        "Coop: Alright, alright. Jeez, okay, so you don't want to talk about it. Ok",
        "Buzz: What is there to talk about? You told me it wasn't going to work, I knew it wasn't going to work, so it didn't work. Big deal.",
        "Coop: Well, you know what the bottom line is, right?",
        "Buzz: No, I don't. Tell me, what is the bottom line?",
        "Coop: You have always wanted to be with Olivia.",
        "Buzz: That's not news Henry.",
        "Coop: Go be with her, Dad, go out there, be with her.",
        "Buzz: I don't want to talk to you about this.",
        "Coop: Would you shut up a second and let me finish. I'm not saying that you...",
        "Buzz: Don't say it then.",
        "Coop: Okay, all right, fine. You know, I saw this coming. Right, just like you did. And now that it's here, what's the big deal?",
        "Buzz: The big deal is that I betrayed my son, ripped his heart out and took his girl.",
        "Coop: You got what you wanted, it's finally here, and we both know that, you know, things happen for a reason. All right, Olivia is miserable. Frank, he's miserable, too, and we certainly know that Frank is not going to be taking Olivia back.",
        "Buzz: We don't know that.",
        "Coop: Uh...",
        "Buzz: Well, okay, we do know that.",
        "Coop: Right.",
        "Buzz: What are you saying? Are you saying that now that she's free, that I should just swoop in and take her?",
        "Coop: Yes.",
        "Buzz: No.",
        "Coop: Listen, remember I told you that I talked to mom on Mother's Day, and she told me that I needed to follow what my heart was telling me, right?",
        "Buzz: Sound advice.",
        "Coop: Exactly. Well, I thought that meant being a stand up guy for Lizzie and the baby. But what I realized is that she meant that towards Ava. Dad, Ava is the one for me who's in here. And I know that down the road, things are going be very hard, we're going to have a lot of struggles, but she is the person who I am meant to be with, and I'm supposed to be with. And I'm willing to fight and do whatever I have to do to make sure that that happens.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, but that's different.",
        "Coop: No, it's the same thing. It's not different at all, all right? When you're with Olivia, that makes you happy, and we absolutely know that when she's with you, she becomes absolutely delirious. All right, look, you're a stand up guy. Who wouldn't love you? Frank, he's strong. He's tough. He'll get over it, all right? You put two happy people together, all right, that's you guys. You have Frank, he's not so happy, but that's fine. All right, he'll get over it.",
        "Buzz: Can I say something? Some people's happiness are more important than others.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Maybe you should taste it first.",
        "Ava: Why? Don't be scared. It's not poisoned. Much.",
        "Olivia: Keep the change. You must be happy with yourself. Frank and Buzz told me to go away, and I'm out of the Coopers' lives. There you go.",
        "Ava: Well, it wasn't my goal, but if it keeps you away from the both of them? Good.",
        "Olivia: Golly, must be nice to be naive.",
        "Ava: I'm not naive.",
        "Olivia: How about ignorant? In the real world, people get hurt, Ava. Everybody hurts everybody.",
        "Ava: Well, where I come from, that's a cop-out for bad behavior. But that way of thinking, I'll bet that way of thinking is probably the main reason why you always end up alone. Thanks for the tip. Have a nice day.",

        "Remy: So you think you'll be happy without a man?",
        "Marina: When have I ever been happy with one?",
        "Remy: Good point. I'm just going to immerse myself in my job, learn to cook, maybe even knit...",
        "Remy: (Laughs)",
        "Marina: Maybe not. But I am going to prove to you and to the rest of the world that I can be a happy and independent woman all on my little lonesome.",
        "Remy: If you say so.",
        "Marina: Come on, since when has this whole two-by-two thing been such a great idea anyway? Name me five happy couples in this town, and I will rethink my position.",
        "Remy: Ok",
        "Marina: (Makes Buzzer sound) time's up! Because you couldn't think of any. Besides, you were so pro-love, you would hook up with one of the, oh, three million women that call the station every day looking for you.",
        "Remy: I don't want three million. Just one'll be fine.",
        "Marina: Hey, we can form a club. The Springfield singles.",
        "Remy: I am not a joiner. Sorry.",
        "Marina: (Laughs)",
        "Remy: So, I shouldn't set you up with this guy I met in Baker's in Chicago last week, hmm? Very cool, sax player, very single. Mmm? Think he'd be your type.",
        "Marina: Oh, please. I am so glad that you think that you know my type. But since I don't even think I know my type, I think we'd better keep him away. Come on, let's go swimming again. And from now on, remember that I am Marina Cooper, a strong, independent, elusive woman of... oh!",
        "Remy: (Laughs)",
        "Marina: ...Mystery.",
        "Remy: Yeah, you show them, Cooper.",

        "Beth: You really are clueless, aren't you, Tammy?",
        "Tammy: I came here to fix the situation, not fight with you.",
        "Beth: Well, too bad. You came unprepared. You think you can walk into this house with your visions of cats and dogs living together under the same roof? All of us holding hands while Lizzie gives birth?",
        "Tammy: Why not? Why can't we all come to some agreement without tearing each other apart?",
        "Beth: Because we don't want any part of you or Jonathan. Tell me, Tammy, where is Jonathan? Why isn't he here? I'll tell you why: Because he wants nothing to do with this baby. And I, for one, say good riddance. He's toxic.",
        "Tammy: He's the father.",
        "Beth: He's cancer. And if you want that in your life, you go ahead. But my daughter survived cancer once, I'll be damned if she'll go through it again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: There you are. What the hell are you doing?",
        "Jonathan: These things don't fix themselves, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, by \"These things\" you mean your heap of junk car?",
        "Jonathan: You're a little too top-heavy for my motorcycle.",
        "Lizzie: I'm pregnant, moron. We're in the middle of nowhere, and I'm starving. The baby is hungry.",
        "Jonathan: Okay, I'm sorry. Well, I might have a candy bar in the car or something.",
        "Lizzie: Oh God, I bet you say this to all your girls. Is this how you got Tammy? Just drove around",
        "Jonathan: Don't, do you understand me, don't even speak her name?",
        "Lizzie: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Hello Alan. It's 10:00 P.M., Do you know where your granddaughter is?",
        "Alan: Is she with you?",
        "Jonathan: I told you she would be.",
        "Alan: What do you want?",
        "Jonathan: You ready to bargain, Grandpa?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Hello, Pop. So... what are we going to do about Olivia, huh?",
        "Buzz: I'm not going after her.",
        "Frank: Oh, okay, Pop.",
        "Buzz: I know what you're thinking. I know what you think I think. But it's not like that.",
        "Frank: You want to enlighten me?",
        "Buzz: Uh... she's a great woman. Period.",
        "Frank: And you don't want that in your life?",
        "Buzz: Not that particular woman.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Oh Whoa (Laugh) I can smell you.",
        "Ava: (Laughs) Is that a good thing or a bad thing?",
        "Coop: No, no, no. Well, depends if you change your shampoo, really.",
        "Ava: Oh...",
        "Coop: I love the way you smell. I missed you.",
        "Ava: Likewise.",
        "Coop: Mm, mm, mm. You do realize it's been less than an hour, right?",
        "Ava: Yes. An hour too long.",
        "Coop: Good answer.",
        "Ava: Yeah?",
        "Coop: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: That's nice.",
        "Buzz: Yep. I don't need one like that. No thanks.",

        "Olivia: Boy, did I miss you!",
        "Emma: Frank!",
        "Olivia: Well... you know, the thing with Frank, sweetie, is that it's a no go. But you know what? We don't need boys, right? It's girl power!",
        "Emma: Yeah.",
        "Olivia: Yeah! You said it.",
        "Emma: No boys!",
        "Olivia: No boys!",
        "Emma: No!",
        "Olivia: No, Emma, what it's about...",
        "Emma: Only girls!",
        "Olivia: That's right. We need to be self-sufficient, and self-employed and self-satisfying in every way, and...",
        "Emma: Girls.",
        "Olivia: Girls! Self-possessed, self-control... that's something mommy's not very good at, self-control. But, hey... come here.",
        "Emma: The girls' playtime.",
        "Olivia: That's right. This is mommy and Emma playtime, and I'm glad I have you. I'm glad I have you. Now tell me who this is again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Well, Tammy, it's getting late. It's been a busy day. Hilda will show you out. Hilda? And do yourself a favor. Nurture your relationship with Jonathan, if that's what you want. You made your bed in this town, with your family. But leave my daughter and her baby out of the equation.",
        "Tammy: It's Jonathan's baby too.",
        "Beth: We'll see about that. Oh, and next time you think to do an end run around Alan by coming to me, the weak link, think again, would you? It's insulting. Hilda.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: You don't seem to understand that nothing you do, absolutely nothing you do, fazes me, Mr. Randall. But you have no idea who you're dealing with. Cause if anything happens to Elizabeth...",
        "Jonathan: Okay, okay, Ally, I get it. You're the man. Your wrath is horrible, your anger shakes the very planet. Did I leave anything out?",
        "Alan: You seem to be amused by all of this.",
        "Jonathan: (Laughs) The only thing that I think is funny is I didn't even want to take Lizzie. But when the mother of my child calls, I come.",
        "Alan: I doubt if she called you.",
        "Jonathan: Oh come on, Al, you're smarter than that. You know my phone number's on speed dial for every girl looking for the fastest way to piss off her parents.",
        "Alan: Where is she?",
        "Jonathan: We took a drive. You'll find her on the road at the far side of the lake.",
        "Alan: You left her there?",
        "Jonathan: Next time, we might even go further. Michigan, St. Louis. Springfield's a hub, man.",
        "Alan: There won't be a next time.",
        "Jonathan: Don't count on it. Unless you back off me and Tammy. Give us our lives back. Lizzie, your grandfather's coming. Lizzie. Yo, Lizzie!",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Tammy: Did you threaten Lizzie? Is that why she's so upset?",
        "Jonathan: I won't let him hurt you, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: What does that mean?",
        "Jonathan: You know what it means.",
        "Tammy: It's war, Uncle Josh. You know Jonathan. He's not going to stop until he gets what he wants."
