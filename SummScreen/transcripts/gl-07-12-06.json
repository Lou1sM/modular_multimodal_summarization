        "Tammy: That's it. All the fighting, I'm sick of it! All the back and forth with Alan. It's ruining our lives. It's disrupting everything that we care about. It's not good for any of us.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy...",
        "Tammy: I can't live like this anymore, Jonathan. Don't try to tell me that everything will be okay, because it won't. Something's got to change. We have to change.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tuesday night ..",
        "Jonathan: We took a drive. You'll find her on the road at the far side of the lake.",
        "Alan: You left her there?",
        "Jonathan: Next time we might even go further. Michigan, St. Louis... Springfield's a hub, man.",
        "Alan: There won't be a next time.",
        "Jonathan: Don't count on it, unless you back off me and Tammy, give us our lives back. Lizzie, your grandfather's coming for... Lizzie! Yo, Lizzie! Come on out, damn it! This isn't funny anymore! Lizzie! Lizzie!",
        "Alan: Why are you calling out her name? Where is she? Where is Elizabeth?",
        "Jonathan: Don't have a coronary, okay? She split. She's gone.",
        "Alan: Now what the hell have you done to her?",
        "Jonathan: Don't worry, I didn't really hurt her. The only problem was trying to decide what to do with the body. Now the trunk is a little too messy, so that was out, and I forgot to pack a shovel.",
        "Alan: You, my friend, are playing a very dangerous game. And if you don't watch it, you're going to be the one ending up in that trunk. Do you hear me?",
        "Tammy: Don't! Stop it! Stop it! What is going on?",
        "Alan: I am trying to find my granddaughter. Now what the hell have you done to her?",
        "Tammy: Lizzie is fine. I just saw her on Main Street. That's how I knew to come here.",
        "Alan: Was she harmed?",
        "Tammy: No, Jonathan would never hurt Lizzie.",
        "Alan: Keep telling yourself that.",
        "Tammy: What did you say to Alan? Did you threaten Lizzie? Is that why she's so upset?",
        "Jonathan: I won't let him hurt you, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: What does that mean?",
        "Jonathan: You know what it means.",
        "Tammy: You promised. You promised you would keep things civil.",
        "Jonathan: Well, what's more important? Keep things civil? Or get our lives back?",
        "Tammy: So, you set Alan up. You called him and told him you'd taken Lizzie to the woods?",
        "Jonathan: Who wiped out my bar, huh? Who set you up when you were at school? I wanted him to know if he tried anything else, I had something I could use, too.",
        "Tammy: Something you could use? Lizzie's pregnant with your baby!",
        "Jonathan: Well, she wouldn't be, if I could change it, okay? If it were up to me, I would go back and erase the whole damn nightmare, but... all I've ever wanted is you. That's it. But this baby is important to Reva. It's her grandkid. And I will not be pushed into signing away all of her rights.",
        "Tammy: What about Lizzie's rights? Doesn't she matter at all? You helped her climb out of a second-story window. What if she'd fallen?",
        "Jonathan: She didn't. And she served her purpose. No one got hurt.",
        "Tammy: Don't be so sure about that. When I saw her, she looked pretty freaked out.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, well.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan. You can pretend to be as cold as Alan Spaulding, but you're not. You need to find Lizzie, try to make this right.",
        "Jonathan: I just want to go home.",
        "Tammy: Where does this end, Jonathan? If you and Alan keep making things worse, where does this end for the baby?",
        "Jonathan: She'll get over it. All right, all right! I'll go look for her. But I am not giving in to Alan Spaulding-- not today, not tomorrow. Never.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Come on, Lizzie, this is the third message I'm leaving you. Where are you? Oh, Springfield's cutest couple. Excuse me while I vomit.",
        "Coop: What do you want, Jonathan?",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie. Have you seen her? I'm not going to cause any trouble. I just want to know, have you seen her?",
        "Ava: She was here a little while ago.",
        "Coop: Look, I think she was probably heading back to her house. Why don't you call her on her cell phone?",
        "Jonathan: She's not returning my calls. But I'm glad you two saw... I mean, did she look okay?",
        "Coop: Look, I don't know. She didn't look herself.",
        "Ava: Why is that, Jonathan? What happened?",
        "Jonathan: I knocked her up. Once Coop's knocked you up, we can talk again.",
        "Coop: You know what, let's just get out of here. Come on.",
        "Jonathan: Or maybe he already did! It's so much fun being a daddy! I'm loving it!",
        "Man: Hey, loving it! Which way to Company? Thanks. Oh, I didn't catch your name.",
        "Jonathan: Jonathan.",
        "Man: Not Jonathan Randall?",
        "Jonathan: What about it?",
        "Man: Greetings from Alan Spaulding.",
        "Jonathan: Oof! ( Fighting noises )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wednesday morning ..",
        "Tammy: Is that you?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Just go back to bed.",
        "Tammy: When did you get back?",
        "Jonathan: Late.",
        "Tammy: Why didn't you wake me up?",
        "Jonathan: I, um... I have to go out for something.",
        "Tammy: Hey. What happened to your eye?",
        "Jonathan: Fell.",
        "Tammy: Fell? Fell on what?",
        "Jonathan: A fist or two.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Oh, Alan. At least my father did his own stunts. You send two thugs to beat me up? Isn't that a little bit beneath you?",
        "Alan: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) Oh, come on. You know exactly what I'm talking about, because if you didn't know what I was talking about, there would be three servants in here, and they'd throw me out like the trash. You do know what I'm talking about. You're sitting there, looking at me, making sure you got your money's worth. Tell you what, you got the daily double. You got black, and you got blue. Relax. Just here to chit-chat.",
        "Alan: About what?",
        "Jonathan: About what? About you and me, how you think you really got me pegged. Thought you could buy me off? Wrong. Thought you could cut me off? Wrong. And violence? Come on. I was raised on it.",
        "Alan: Well, you certainly are Reva's son, because you don't know when to quit.",
        "Jonathan: No. I'll do whatever I have to do. You cut off this hand, I'll use this one. You bust my kneecaps, I'll crawl.",
        "Alan: Why? What do you want? Certainly not the baby-- the baby you put at risk when you kidnapped Elizabeth. The baby's not even real to you.",
        "Jonathan: No. But you will not get that baby, Alan. That's real.",
        "Alan: You want to beat me, Alan Spaulding, put him in his place. Is that it?",
        "Jonathan: I don't know exactly what it's like to be a father yet, but...",
        "Alan: Do you want to be a father? Huh? Ah. Because if you wanted to be a father, you and I would have something to talk about. But you don't. So good- bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Shh. Look, the door is cracked a little. I know I locked it when I left. I think there's someone in there.",
        "Jonathan: Stay here. If I'm not back out in a few minutes, you run like hell. Okay, buddy! What the hell? I thought... Tammy, it's okay.",
        "Tammy: Lizzie! We thought someone broke in! Are you okay? I'm glad you're here.",
        "Lizzie: You are?",
        "Tammy: Yes. Jonathan was looking for you, to apologize.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, about, um... before, in the car?",
        "Lizzie: Forget all that. It doesn't matter anymore.",
        "Jonathan: Why'd you run away like that?",
        "Lizzie: Who cares? None of that matters anymore.",
        "Jonathan: What are you talking about?",
        "Lizzie: It's over. All of it, it's over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tuesday night ..",
        "Lizzie: ( Sighs ) What's going on out there? Huh, girl?",
        "Jonathan: We took a ride. You'll see her on the road on the far side of the lake. Next time we might even go further. Say Michigan, St. Louis... Springfield's a hub, man.",
        "Lizzie: He's using us. Everyone is. It's never going to change.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Lizzie? What's wrong?",
        "Lizzie: Um, nothing, I just... I have something in my eye.",
        "Tammy: Lizzie, it's me. Whatever it is, you can tell me.",
        "Lizzie: I don't want to talk to you.",
        "Tammy: Why not? Did Jonathan have something to do with this? He did, didn't he? What happened?",
        "Lizzie: Ask your boyfriend. He's out by the lake on Old Ferguson Road. I'm sure he can't wait to tell you all about it.",
        "Coop: ( Whispering )",
        "Ava: I know. That's what I think, too.",
        "Coop: Even when we weren't supposed to be together, I would do things. I would time it out so that I was going downstairs at the exact same time that you were. Ah, geez, I would even compare the way felt just seeing you to the way I felt being around Lizzie. I've got to tell you, Ava, there's no comparison.",
        "Ava: Part of me actually kind of feels bad for Lizzie.",
        "Coop: She'll be fine. You know what? So will I, now. I mean, look at this, can you believe this? Here we are, all by ourselves, sitting down, having a picnic on a blanket. We've got a bottle of wine right here. No interruptions, finally.",
        "Ava: I know, it's a rarity. I'm just waiting for Lizzie to, like, pop out of the bushes or something.",
        "Coop: Even if she did, it wouldn't change anything. Ava, you and I have worked way too hard to get to where we are. You know, there was a time when I thought...",
        "Ava: Me, too. But here we are.",
        "Coop: Yeah. It's funny. You know, if I had gone through with the marriage to Lizzie, I honestly believe I would have spent the rest of my life wondering what it would have been like for us. (Dog barks )",
        "Lizzie: ( Gasps )",
        "Coop: Hello? Hey, who's there?",
        "Lizzie: Hey, it's you guys. What do you know.",
        "Coop: Yeah, how about that?",
        "Lizzie: I wasn't, um... just forget I was here.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, wait, whoa, hold on. Wait a second. Look, what are you doing out here so late? Are you alone?",
        "Lizzie: Alone? Yeah, I am alone. But what's new, right? I've got to go.",
        "Coop: Whoa, wait. Lizzie, you seem a little upset here. What's going on?",
        "Lizzie: I'm fine.",
        "Coop: Are you sure?",
        "Lizzie: You have a picnic to get back to, so don't worry about me. Whatever happens, happens, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "( Knock on door )",
        "Alan: Elizabeth? You in there? Hilda said she saw you come home, and I wanted to make sure that you were okay. That's all I care about.",
        "Lizzie: ( Scoffs ) All you care about is the baby that I'm carrying. You don't care about me, Granddad! Nobody does.",
        "Alan: Don't be ridiculous, sweetheart. That's not true. Now, I apologize for what happened tonight. Jonathan Randall will regret what he did, believe me. He's the scum of the earth, even lower.",
        "Lizzie: He is the baby's father!",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, why don't you open the door? Let me come in. I will cheer you up.",
        "Lizzie: Nothing can make this better. Nothing. I know what I have to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wednesday morning ..",
        "Ms. Wilson: Elizabeth Spaulding? How far along are you? I don't see your...",
        "Lizzie: My medical chart. I forgot to turn it in.",
        "Ms. Wilson: Okay. Well, I'm sorry that you had to come see us today, but we are here to help. You are sure you want to do this?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. I am. Oh, God, that's weird. I'm doing the right thing. This is the right thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Okay, buddy! What the hell? I thought... Tammy, it's okay.",
        "Tammy: Lizzie! We thought someone broke in. Are you okay? I'm glad you're here.",
        "Lizzie: You are?",
        "Tammy: Yes. Jonathan was looking for you, to apologize.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, about, uh... before, in the car.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, just forget all that. It doesn't matter anymore.",
        "Jonathan: Why did you run away like that?",
        "Lizzie: Who cares? None of that matters anymore.",
        "Jonathan: What are you talking about?",
        "Lizzie: It's over. All of it, it's over. I didn't want this baby anymore, so I took care of everything.",
        "Tammy: My God, what are you saying?",
        "Lizzie: I am saying that my little girl won't be a problem for anyone, anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tuesday night ..",
        "Tammy: Jonathan? I just left the Spaulding place. I went to see Beth, and... just call me, okay? Lizzie? What's wrong?",
        "Lizzie: Um, nothing. I just have something in my eye.",
        "Tammy: Lizzie, it's me. Whatever it is, you can tell me.",
        "Lizzie: I don't want to talk to you.",
        "Tammy: Why not? Did Jonathan have something to do with this? He did, didn't he? What happened?",
        "Lizzie: Ask your boyfriend. He's out by the lake on Old Ferguson Road. I'm sure he can't wait to tell you all about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: You, my friend, are playing a very dangerous game. And if you don't watch it, you're going to be the one in that trunk!",
        "Tammy: Don't! Stop it! Stop it! What's going on?",
        "Alan: I'm trying to find my granddaughter!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: You set Alan up. You called him and told him you'd taken Lizzie to the woods.",
        "Jonathan: Who wiped out my bar, huh? Who framed you at school? I wanted him to know if he did anything else, I had something that I could use, too.",
        "Tammy: Something you can use? Lizzie's pregnant with your baby!",
        "Jonathan: Well, she wouldn't be if I could change it. I wish I could go back and erase the whole damn nightmare, but... all I've ever wanted is you, Tammy. That's it. But this baby is important to Reva. It's her grandkid. And I will not be forced to sign away all of her rights.",

        "Jonathan: She'll get over it. All right! I'll go look for her. But I will not give in to Alan Spaulding-- not today, not tomorrow. Never.",
        "Coop: It's the perfect night out, see? There's a full moon.",
        "Ava: It is!",
        "Coop: Oh, hey! Tammy!",
        "Ava: Hi!",
        "Tammy: Where you going with all the stuff?",
        "Ava: We're going to have a picnic in the park.",
        "Tammy: This time of night?",
        "Coop: Don't worry. I'll protect you.",
        "Ava: And I'll protect you. Life without Lizzie. You know? I still can't believe we get to be together, like a normal couple.",
        "Tammy: What's that like?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Jonathan?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wednesday morning ..",
        "Tammy: Is that you?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Just go back to bed.",
        "Tammy: When did you get back?",
        "Jonathan: Late.",
        "Tammy: Why didn't you wake me up?",
        "Jonathan: I, um... I have to go out somewhere.",
        "Tammy: Hey. What happened to your eye?",
        "Jonathan: I fell.",
        "Tammy: Fell? Fell on what?",
        "Jonathan: A fist or two.",
        "Tammy: Hi. I need to talk to you. I didn't know who else I can go to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: That's the whole story.",
        "Josh: Okay. Look, let me get this straight. Now, first, Alan makes Lizzie a prisoner in her own bedroom. Then Jonathan helps her to escape, but only to use her to warn Alan to back off, or else.",
        "Tammy: It's war, Uncle Josh. It's war. And you know Jonathan. He's not going to stop until he gets what he wants.",
        "Josh: What does he want?",
        "Tammy: I don't think he even knows. I mean, he keeps talking about his \"rights\"; that he's not going to let Alan take away Aunt Reva's grandchild. I mean, it's more like it's about her than him.",
        "Josh: So this is not about Jonathan wanting to claim his child and be a good father.",
        "Tammy: He doesn't even want to be a father! I think he's scared, mostly, you know, that he'll turn into Nate. I think that's who Alan reminds him of.",
        "Josh: He couldn't fight back as a kid, so he's making up for it now.",
        "Tammy: It's like it's a turf war, and the prize is the baby that Jonathan doesn't want, the baby that Alan doesn't want him anywhere near.",
        "Josh: I know you love Jonathan. I respect that. But he has a lot of difficult choices to make. I see two scenarios. One, Jonathan and Alan continue their battle, and you get caught in the cross-fire. In fact, you already have been. Or two, Jonathan takes on the responsibility of his child the way you want him to. But that creates a whole different set of problems in your life. Either way, Tammy, you end up collateral damage.",
        "Tammy: You make this sound like it can't be fixed.",
        "Josh: Sometimes the best fix, the only fix, is the one we don't want to face.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Tammy!",
        "Tammy: Shh! Look, the door is cracked a little. I know I locked it when I left. I think there's someone in there.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. Stay here. If I'm not back out in a few minutes, you run like hell. Okay, buddy! What the hell? I thought... Tammy, it's okay.",
        "Tammy: Lizzie! We thought someone broke in. Are you okay? I'm glad you're here.",
        "Lizzie: You are?",
        "Tammy: Yes. Jonathan was looking for you, to apologize.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, uh... about before, in the car.",
        "Lizzie: Forget all that. It doesn't matter anymore.",
        "Jonathan: Why did you run away like that?",
        "Lizzie: Who cares? None of that matters anymore.",
        "Jonathan: What are you talking about?",
        "Lizzie: It's over. All of it, it's over. I didn't want this baby anymore, so I took care of everything.",
        "Tammy: Oh, my God. What are you saying?",
        "Lizzie: I'm saying that my little girl won't be a problem for anyone, anymore.",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie? What the hell did you do?",
        "Lizzie: Don't look at me like that! I could never abort this baby! I love her. I'm the only one who does! You don't. Mom and granddad sure don't. I had to make sure that she was going to be all right.",
        "Tammy: But you just said that it was over, that the baby wouldn't be a problem anymore.",
        "Lizzie: She won't be. I've decided to give her up for adoption.",
        "Tammy: Lizzie, how could you even think about giving your baby up for adoption?",
        "Lizzie: You can just quit the whole \"I'm so shocked\" routine. This is a dream come true for you, for both of you. No more baby, problem solved. Right, papa?",
        "Jonathan: What the hell would make you want to give up your baby?",
        "Lizzie: My baby?",
        "Jonathan: All right, you know what I meant. What happened to make you...",
        "Lizzie: Because even though I'm pregnant, I'm still a person, Jonathan. And I used to have a life. I used to be more than just some piece on a game board that you and granddad could push around! Look, I love my little girl. I do. But I don't have a choice. If I have this baby, I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life. No one will ever want to have anything to do with me.",
        "Tammy: That's not true.",
        "Lizzie: Stop lying. You and Jonathan will go off together, and Ava has Coop. I will be stuck for the rest of my life in that house with my mom and my granddad! And we'll be fighting! And the baby will be crying, wishing to hell that I had given her up!",
        "Tammy: It doesn't have to be that way!",
        "Lizzie: Get real. No guy my age is going to want to be saddled with a baby. This is the best thing, for all of us.",
        "Jonathan: Uh-uh. I won't allow that to happen.",
        "Lizzie: Let me guess. Because of Reva?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, that. And the adoption thing, I... I don't agree with it.",
        "Lizzie: My dad was adopted, and he was happy.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, until he went crazy and kidnapped all the kids in town!",
        "Lizzie: Look, I've made this decision, Jonathan. This way, we all lose our rights. It'll be fair for everybody.",
        "Jonathan: You think?",
        "Lizzie: I informed you as a courtesy, but I'm going to do this whether you like it or not.",
        "Tammy: Lizzie! Lizzie, wait! Hey! Go after her! Go on, aren't you going to stop her?",
        "Jonathan: Maybe she's doing the right thing for once.",
        "Tammy: You can't honestly believe that. You spent your whole life wondering where your mother was and why she didn't want you. Are you really going to allow that to happen to your daughter?",
        "Jonathan: It'll be different for her.",
        "Tammy: But not for you. Jonathan, go after her, not because I'm telling you to do it. Just go after her because inside, you know it's the right thing, for you and the baby.",
        "Jonathan: I'll go for you. That's all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, we're going home.",
        "Lizzie: I'm busy, Granddad.",
        "Alan: You come along with me.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, back off! Get your hands off her!",
        "Alan: You turn around and walk away, or I will have you arrested for stalking my granddaughter!",
        "Lizzie: I have to get out of here.",
        "Tammy: You can't do this. You can't give up your baby!",
        "Alan: What are you talking about, give up the baby?",
        "Jonathan: Look, Lizzie, Tammy's right. You're the mother of the kid. You can't let a stranger raise it.",
        "Lizzie: We'll find a good home for her, okay?",
        "Jonathan: No, no. How do you know? Look. Look at me. Look at what a mess I am. Okay? I am your little girl, Lizzie, all grown up. Reva thought she was doing the right thing when she gave me up. How do you know?",
        "Lizzie: It would be an open adoption. I'd be able to check on her.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, you are not putting that child up for adoption. We are raising it!",
        "Jonathan: Look, don't listen to Alan. He has no say in this. You are the mother of that kid.",
        "Alan: This coming from a man who doesn't care about you or the welfare of that child. He kidnaps you and takes you to the middle of nowhere!",
        "Jonathan: You lock her up in the mansion like she's an animal!",
        "Alan: So she can get psychiatric help, Jonathan!",
        "Jonathan: Oh, come on! But you don't even trust her. You just want that baby so close, you can snatch it away as soon as it's born. You don't think Lizzie's going to be a good mother to the kid. You're wrong. She's going to be a great mom. The thing's not even born yet. She loves it. She's on the right track, so leave her alone.",
        "Lizzie: Thank you.",
        "Jonathan: No problem.",
        "Lizzie: Let's go.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth... Elizabeth, come back! You'll regret this!",
        "Jonathan: ( Yells ) How about the look on Alan's face? I wish I had a camera! Ooh! That was almost worth the black eye.",
        "Lizzie: ( Laughs ) Okay, okay. So you stood up to the great Alan Spaulding. Now what?",
        "Jonathan: I don't know. I want to celebrate.",
        "Lizzie: Celebrate what? I'm worse off now than I was before.",
        "Jonathan: Well, I told you I wouldn't put you in the middle anymore, which I'm not going to do.",
        "Lizzie: Right, and I'm not in the middle. According to my granddad, I'm now on your side. So, I mean, where does that get me? You two are going to go on with your lives, and I'll still be alone with my baby.",
        "Tammy: She's right.",
        "Lizzie: All you did was complicate things.",
        "Jonathan: Well, I tried.",
        "Tammy: That's it?",
        "Jonathan: What do you want me to say?",
        "Tammy: I don't even know anymore. I just know that this cannot go on like this. I'm done. I'm done.",
        "Jonathan: Done? Done?",
        "Tammy: That's it. All the fighting, I'm sick of it. All the back and forth with Alan, it's ruining our lives. It's disrupting everything we care about. It's not good for any of us.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy! Tammy!",
        "Tammy: I can't keep living like this, Jonathan. Don't try to tell me that it's all going to work out, because it's not. So something has to change. We have to change.",
        "Jonathan: Are you leaving me? Tammy! Hey! Are you leaving me? Why? Why are you doing this? I made the baby a priority. I went after Lizzie. I did everything that you asked me to do! And you're going to pack up and walk out?",
        "Tammy: Jonathan!",
        "Jonathan: No, no, no! You don't get to do that! I'm not going to sit by and watch you...",
        "Tammy: I'm not leaving you!",
        "Jonathan: What?",
        "Tammy: I'm not moving out. All right, I am, but so are you. All of us are moving, Lizzie included.",
        "Lizzie: Excuse me?",
        "Tammy: This is going to work. The only way is if we do it together, so we need to find a place that's big enough for the three of us. That way, Jonathan and I can help you.",
        "Lizzie: You want to move in with me?",
        "Tammy: This is the only way for any of us to get sane, okay? I mean, think about it. You feel isolated, right? So isolated that you're willing to give up your baby. And you feel pressured-- so pressured that you put your own baby's life in jeopardy by driving Lizzie out into the middle of nowhere. And me, I have reached my limit. So either we're going to do this, or I will walk away. So?",
        "Jonathan: There's got to be a better way than this.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah.",
        "Tammy: There's not. If you ever leave Lizzie alone again, what's to say she won't go back to that adoption place? If you're going to be on Lizzie's side, don't do it halfway. Show her that you're serious. Let's all do this, the three of us.",
        "Jonathan: This is a really bad idea. But it wouldn't be my first. And definitely won't be my last, so...",
        "Tammy: Lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: Um... what about Roxy?",
        "Tammy: Roxy, too. She'll get along great with Jonathan's snake, Lou.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. We can introduce them and see who eats who.",
        "Tammy: He's kidding. Are you with us?",
        "Lizzie: We're with you.",
        "Tammy: Go on.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Dinah: I can't believe we're doing this. We're really getting married.",
        "Mallet: We're getting married! I would be honored.",
        "Gus: Are you going to ask me to be your best man?",
        "Dinah: Forget it. The wedding's off!",
        "Gus: Butcher block.",
        "Harley: Butcher block?",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: Butcher block?! Butcher block is great. We agree on everything. We never argue.",
        "Gus: Ever since we got back together, she's been freaking me out.",
        "Reva: You know, I'm going to think of this move to the hotel as a step on my journey back home to Josh."
