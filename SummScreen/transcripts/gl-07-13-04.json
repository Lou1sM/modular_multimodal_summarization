One thing hasn't changed: Your sister still takes forever to get ready in the morning.", "Mel: Yeah, I hear you.", "Rick: Hey, it takes a lot of work to look this darn sexy. (Laughter) it does.", "Michelle: And I've got to dazzle people so they don't notice I have no idea who they are.", "Mel: You guys seem pretty happy this morning.", "Rick: Mm-hmm.", "Michelle: Well, I guess you could say we had a revelation last night, yeah.", "Rick: Really? And what's that?", "Michelle: He doesn't understand me and I don't understand him. Isn't that great?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: I'm not going.", "Marina: Are you kidding me? It's a perfect beach day.", "Tammy: It's also a perfect day to sit around and listen to the same sad song on repeat a thousand times.", "Marina: You're in a cheery mood. I'm guessing it's about you and joey.", "Tammy: There is no me and joey, unless it's me being mad because joey is taking lizzie to the dance.", "Marina: He's still working around the farm, isn't he?", "Tammy: Yeah.", "Marina: Because he wants to be with you.", "Tammy: So people keep saying. But every time I get close to him, he finds a reason to bolt.", "Marina: Don't worry about joey. He'll come around. Lizzie, on the other hand, i would worry about.", "Tammy: Speak of the devil.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: Hi.", "Tammy: What do you want, lizzie?", "Lizzie: I wanted to apologize. I didn't want you to think that I was going after joey.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy and marina: No.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Buzz: Mr. Chairman.", "Frank: Hey, pop.", "Buzz: Spanakopita, in honor of your new gig. I figured you would not be going out to lunch and I... is this a bad time?", "Frank: I'm sorry, what did you say, pop?", "Buzz: Is this a bad time?", "Frank: No, I just got a lot on my mind.", "Buzz: Oh, I know what it is. Marina spending the night in the cooler.", "Frank: Uh, no. I've been through a lot worse than that with her.", "Buzz: Work stuff.", "Frank: Yeah, pop, work stuff. Work stuff.", "Buzz: Well, you know, then I'll let you get back to it. I just... is there a refrigerator that I can put this in?", "Frank: I'll take that. Thank you very much, dad.", "Buzz: Okay.", "Frank: Hey, pop?", "Buzz: Mm-hmm.", "Frank: It's alexandra. I brought her in yesterday for some questioning.", "Buzz: Oh. What?", "Frank: I don't trust her, and neither should you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: You rang?", "Alexandra: Well, I thought we might celebrate.", "Gus: What are we celebrating?", "Alexandra: Your promotion. My statement to frank going off without a hitch. He did buy it, didn't he?", "Gus: What do you love about buzz?", "Alexandra: I'm sorry?", "Gus: What is it about buzz that you particularly love.", "Alexandra: (Laughs) he's funny. He's smart. He's unpredictable.", "Gus: Forget the funny bit. Unpredictable, smart-- like his son, the chief of police. We've got to be really careful with frank.", "Harley: Okay, we have got a very big problem.", "Gus: Is something wrong?", "Harley: It's a big mess.", "Gus: What's a mess?", "Harley: I cannot find the right rings!", "Alexandra: (Laughs) oh, is that all?", "Harley: \"Is that all?\" This coming from the woman who is planning the wedding of the 21st century.", "Alexandra: Darling, there's plenty of time.", "Harley: Do you hear yourself? Do you know what day it is? Hey, I am happy to wear two cigar bands, I don't care about that. I just don't want to deal with this stuff anymore.", "Gus: Honestly, honey, what is the big deal? They're just a couple of rings.", "Alexandra: Well, you know, actually, gus, you know, they're... (laughs) harley may look at this whole thing as a folderol, but there's not a woman in the world who doesn't consider wedding rings very, very seriously important. Right, darling?", "Harley: Yeah. Yeah.", "Alexandra: Important for both rings to be perfect.", "Harley: Perfect. They have to be perfect. Both of them have to be perfect.", "Gus: All right, I'm sorry. Look, I just thought rings were rings. Look, we go to the mall. We go to the mall right now.", "Alexandra: Oh, gus, dear.", "Gus: We pick out whatever you want, right this second. I'M... no?", "Harley: I didn't like anything that I found at the mall.", "Alexandra: Of course.", "Harley: Because they have to be special. They need to be different. That's why this is such a hard decision.", "Gus: I just thought that, you know, you were making a big deal out of it. Open your book up. Open this up and just point to any one, just like that. Now. Like that one, see? That's a nice one. \"A.\" \"A-137.\"", "Harley: These rings have to show what we have. They have to show who we are. They're going to signify our faith and our trust in each other. What?", "Gus: The trust is important. I know that.", "Alexandra: Look, I really should go. You two have to sort this one out all by yourselves.", "Harley: Wait a minute. You're not going to stay here and help me?", "Alexandra: Darling, I have to... I'm meeting your father, actually.", "Harley: Oh, okay. Well, when you see my father, make sure that you tell him i said: (Screams)", "Alexandra: (Laughs) oh, come on. Relax, it'll be fine.", "Gus: I'll walk you out.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Buzz: So you think alex was lying to you when you questioned her?", "Frank: What do you think?", "Buzz: I'm not the one that doesn't trust her.", "Frank: Pop, I'm not accusing alexandra of being guilty of anything. I just didn't like some of her answers.", "Buzz: You didn't like some of her answers.", "Frank: Listen, I wouldn't be doing this. Listen to me, I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't think it was...", "Buzz: Did she ask for a lawyer?", "Frank: No.", "Buzz: Did she refuse to answer questions?", "Frank: No.", "Buzz: Did you catch her in any lies?", "Frank: Not that I know of. It's just in my gut, pop. You know...", "Buzz: Your gut is overactive. I know what you're doing. You're trying to help your sister.", "Frank: I have an obligation to get down to the bottom of this case.", "Buzz: Frank, the obligation you feel is towards your sister. That's why you're going after alex. You're worried about your sister marrying into the spaulding family again.", "Frank: Really? Aren't you?", "Buzz: The truth, I mean, alex is a lot of things, but a drug dealer? Come on.", "Frank: I hope you're right.", "Buzz: Well, then drop it. Take alex at her word, and let your sister be happy.", "Frank: Dad, that's all I want is my sister's happiness.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marina: First shayne, now joey?", "Lizzie: You are so wrong, marina. Listen, tammy, I'm sorry for the way joey and I left last night.", "Tammy: Why? Wasn't there room in the limo?", "Marina: (Laughs)", "Lizzie: You know, you're not helping, marina.", "Marina: So sorry.", "Lizzie: Yeah. Listen, okay, I know the way things looked and everything, but I was talking you up the whole time.", "Tammy: I'm sure you were.", "Lizzie: Tammy, you're my friend. Okay, even if I wanted to get with joey-- which I don't, okay, I'd be stupid if I did-- I know things aren't over between you two.", "Marina: Is that why you're going to the summer fling together?", "Lizzie: For your information, he asked me, okay? And the only reason why he did that is because he's upset that tammy is going with remy.", "Tammy: Did joey say that?", "Lizzie: No, but tammy, isn't it obvious? I mean, you guys got in a fight and he was just trying to hurt you. Why else would he ask me right in front of you?", "Tammy: Why did you say yes?", "Lizzie: You know, i understand why you don't trust people, marina. I mean, look at the way you were raised.", "Marina: Look at the way i was raised?", "Lizzie: Tammy, do you think maybe just you and I could talk? The two of us, please?", "Tammy: Okay. Let's have a sleep-over, and then we can talk about boys, and I can do your nails, and you can twist the knife in my back.", "Lizzie: I am sick and tired of being made out as a bad person.", "Marina: I can't imagine where it comes from.", "Lizzie: Look, tammy. Okay, I have always been your friend and we have gotten each other through some hard times. If anyone is to blame here, it's joey.", "Marina: Here we go.", "Lizzie: No, you know what? It's true. He's just trying to make you jealous the same way you are by going to the dance with remy.", "Marina: Stop trying to shift the focus away from you, lizzie.", "Lizzie: Listen, marina, if i was trying to shift the focus, I'd bring out the point that we're all using our spaulding partners in one way or another.", "Marina: What is that supposed to mean?", "Lizzie: Well, you haven't been miss little innocent. Didn't you just spend the night with sandy?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: All right, let me get this straight. You guys are completely clueless about each other, and that's a good thing? Is that what you're saying?", "Danny: Yeah. Hey, at least we can admit it.", "Mel: That's right. I think that's great. I mean, I hate couples who think like they know it all.", "Rick: Right, me, too.", "Danny: There you go.", "Michelle: Oh, yeah. Well, we won't be one of those.", "Danny: Uh-uh.", "Michelle: Were we ever one of those couples?", "Danny: Oh, no. No, never.", "Michelle: Thank god. (Laughs)", "Danny: So now the pressure is off.", "Michelle: No trying to figure out who bought who what for christmas last year, the year before.", "Rick: Or how to recreate bea's apple pie recipe.", "Michelle: (Groans) oh, god, that apple pie.", "Rick: I know halber's bakery when I taste it. I mean, those are some good apple pies.", "Michelle: You know, I'm guessing that you're lucky that I have no memory, because I have a feeling that I could really embarrass you.", "Rick: I don't embarrass.", "Mel: Don't listen to him.", "Danny: Really?", "Rick: No, don'T.", "Michelle: That's all right. I've picked up on this.", "Danny: Rick, maybe you should... this is a good time for you to fill your sister in on your family's dark secrets.", "Rick: What are you trying to do? Are you trying to give her some blackmail material? Don't do that.", "Danny: Well, then talk about something else because I need to borrow your wife for a little while.", "Rick: What?", "Danny: Yeah, I need some advice from a harley's angel. What do you say?", "Michelle: Uh-oh. What are you up to?", "Danny: Well, why don't you meet me at the beach in about an hour, and you'll find out.", "Michelle: All right.", "Danny: Okay? It's okay? Do you mind? It won't be long, I promise.", "Rick: All right.", "Danny: Okay?", "Rick: Not long, all right? As long as I get to keep my sister, she's all yours. All right, don't be long.", "Michelle: You know, he's got a great piece of...", "Rick: No, no. I don't want to hear about that, okay? I'm your brother.", "Michelle: Don't be so uptight, bro.", "Rick: Bro? You've got to be kidding me. Bro?", "Michelle: I am kidding, all right? I'm in a good mood.", "Rick: Really?", "Michelle: I'm happy.", "Rick: That's great. Good, good, good, good.", "Michelle: You don't believe me.", "Rick: I've just known you my entire life, michelle. The only time that you're all smiley is when you're trying to act all smiley. So, what's going on? What's it really like in that house?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Any of these hitting you?", "Gus: These?", "Harley: Or this?", "Gus: Not really. You know, you surprise me.", "Harley: I do?", "Gus: Yeah. Throwing yourself in like this, full-hearted, you know?", "Harley: Well, I think I'm just... you know, I'm sick of drug busts, conspiracy theories. I'm all about flowers and the cake and the rings. What about these? We need some color.", "Gus: Maybe you should just become a wedding planner.", "Harley: I'm just excited, that's all. It's fun being the bride this time around.", "Gus: Really?", "Harley: Mm-hmm.", "Gus: Really?", "Harley: Well, I am marrying you. How great is that?", "Gus: Yeah. And you don't have a little too much spaulding, you know, commentary from the sidelines?", "Harley: Not a problem.", "Gus: Really? Why is that?", "Harley: I had a talk with alan. He welcomed me into your family.", "Gus: And you accept that... that welcome?", "Harley: Yes, it was very sweet, actually.", "Gus: Good. All right.", "Harley: And alexandra seems to be back to her old self again.", "Gus: Uh-huh.", "Harley: And I think it's because of you.", "Gus: Me?", "Harley: Yes. I think you are a good influence on them. I do.", "Gus: I doubt that.", "Harley: No, it's true. They've changed.", "Gus: Do you feel that i have changed?", "Harley: No, you're still the same rude, messy jerk you always were.", "Gus: Really? That's what you think? That's what you think?", "Harley: (Laughs) I think you're actually as much a cooper as you are a spaulding.", "Gus: Well, then maybe our families are a lot more similar than everybody gives them credit for.", "Harley: Don't ever let frank hear you say that.", "Gus: No, think about it. You people, the coopers, they'd walk across fire or glass for each other, right? It's the same with the spauldings, really. They would do whatever it takes, no matter what, they stick together. We stick together.", "Harley: So when we exchange our rings, when we find our rings to exchange them, we're going to be one big happy family. Did you notice I said that without choking?", "Gus: I was wondering...", "Harley: Did you see that?", "Gus: It looked like you were about to choke.", "Harley: Well, here. I want to promise you something. I promise I will never ask you to choose me over them. Cheers.", "Gus: Cheers.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: Harley. Gus. You don't have to search anymore. I've found exactly what you're looking for.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Buzz: Well, hello, gorgeous. I thought we were meeting at company.", "Alexandra: Well, we were, but I was early and I knew you were going to be here.", "Buzz: Oh, you're a brave woman, darkening these doors. I heard about the interrogation. Frank filled me in.", "Alexandra: Ah, yes. Well, he was just doing his job. Where is he today?", "Buzz: Meeting with ross. Come here. I think we should put our heads together.", "Alexandra: Is this going to be fun?", "Buzz: We both want this wedding between harley and gus to be a hit, right?", "Alexandra: Right. And I think it's going to do wonders for the cooper/spaulding relationship.", "Buzz: I'm glad to hear you say that. However, there seems to be a little residual distrust between the families.", "Alexandra: Distrust?", "Buzz: Yes. I mean, understandably, given the history, but you have to understand how my kids operate.", "Alexandra: Did frank say something to you about me?", "Buzz: Well, the only way to say it is to say it. He thinks you're hiding something.", "Alexandra: I answered all his questions. I mean, I told him everything i thought was important at all about this horrendous drug case. I don't know what else I could say.", "Buzz: Well, if you stick to the truth, you won't get hurt.", "Alexandra: You know, nothing seems to hurt me if you're with me. Listen, give me a minute. I have to check with the office, okay?", "Buzz: Okay.", "Alexandra: Marjorie. Yes, it's me. That file we talked about on chief cooper? I'm going to need it after all. Now.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marina: Yeah, sandy and i spent the night together in jail. It was so romantic.", "Lizzie: Well, whatever floats your boat.", "Marina: Did I ever show you that thing my dad taught me about subduing an unruly perp?", "Lizzie: It always comes down to violence with you people.", "Marina: \"You people?\"", "Tammy: Okay, lizzie, just drop it.", "Lizzie: Now, you know what? I came here to apologize and if marina hadn't opened her big, fat mouth, maybe...", "Marina: I call it like I see it, honey.", "Lizzie: Oh, well, you know what? So do I, honey.", "Marina: And what do you see, exactly? I want to hear this.", "Lizzie: Okay, you know what? Well, ever since sandy got here, he was a loner, but hey, since this partnership started, everything has just opened right up, hasn't it?", "Tammy: Hey, lizzie? Do you think this is really winning you any points with me?", "Lizzie: Well, you know what? I'm sorry, tammy, but it's true.", "Tammy: Marina loves shayne. She's not after his brother.", "Lizzie: I didn't say she was.", "Tammy: You pretty much did, yeah.", "Lizzie: No, I simply pointed out the fact that sandy trusts marina. I guess they have to, to hack into a complete computer system of a big corporation, right?", "Marina: (Laughs)", "Lizzie: You know, you may think this is a joke, but it's actually kind of serious.", "Marina: Whatever. Look, sandy trusts me, but real friends do that.", "Lizzie: Hey, I wasn't putting down your friendship. I mean, you learned how to work the computer, didn't you?", "Tammy: Too bad you can't use your talents to find out who's opening up credit cards in my mom's name.", "Marina: Identity theft?", "Tammy: Yeah, and whoever is doing it has taken on her life as princess cassie. It's freaking her out.", "Lizzie: Yeah, that would freak me out, too.", "Marina: Oh. Are you still here?", "Lizzie: Yes, I am still here, okay? And I'm concerned about tammy's mother. That's creepy to think somebody could just take away your life like that.", "Tammy: Yeah. It probably feels something like having your boyfriend stolen.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Mel: I heard you were quite the romantic.", "Danny: Yeah, well, you know, I try.", "Mel: Michelle is a very lucky woman.", "Danny: I hope she thinks so.", "Mel: Are you kidding? A gourmet picnic on the beach, a beautiful day, a loving husband. It would work for me. So, what have you got in the basket?", "Danny: Okay, well, some wineglasses, some wine. I did not make any of this. Just, you know, fruit, cheese, crackers, salad, some chicken.", "Mel: Nice.", "Danny: And for dessert, just a little something that washed up on the beach.", "Mel: Oh. These are nice.", "Danny: Okay, I'm sensing that everything just completely stopped working for you.", "Mel: This is all really sweet.", "Danny: What?", "Mel: The pearls are a bit much.", "Danny: What? Michelle loves pearls. At least she used to.", "Mel: No, but think about how it is when you first start dating somebody.", "Danny: It takes a while to get to jewelry.", "Mel: Yeah. I mean, a few months at least. And besides, michelle might not even like pearls anymore.", "Danny: You think I'm trying to remind her of who she used to be?", "Mel: Aren't you?", "Danny: I just wanted to show her how crazy I am about who she is now.", "Mel: But who is michelle? Who is she? Do you even know?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: No offense, rick, but you know, you used to know me. I'm smiling now because I have something to smile about.", "Rick: Good, and it's a great smile. It's great.", "Michelle: I'm really, really getting sick of having to convince people that I mean what I say.", "Rick: You don't have to convince me of your smiles. They're good smiles.", "Michelle: Have you taken a look at the way danny looks at me?", "Rick: Mm-hmm.", "Michelle: What woman wouldn't want that?", "Rick: Well, you're right. I know danny and he takes an all-or-nothing approach to love, and I've never doubted for a second that he loves you.", "Michelle: You know, I've been doing some research on memory loss. You know, what happens, how people cope with it?", "Rick: Really? That's great. What did you find out?", "Michelle: Well, that some people never go back to how they were. Some actually decide to run, start over, and create a whole new life.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tony: That's not what you're doing, right?", "Michelle: Well, not yet. I'm just getting rick's opinion here. (Pager beeps)", "Rick: Looks like somebody else wants my opinion. It's my beeper. I'll be right back.", "Bellman: Let me get those for you, mr. Mitchell.", "Mitchell: No, no, no. I've got them.", "Tony: Okay, so if you're not thinking about it, why bring up running away at all? Hm? I mean, seriously, why bring it up?", "Michelle: Look, don't read into it. I'm just...", "Bellman: Mr. Mitchell!", "Michelle: Somebody call 911! Sir. Sir. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Hello. Coming up on \"guiding light.\"", "Lizzie: Grandpa was right. Competitions really bring out the best in people, and the worst.", "Tammy: Well, then get ready because you are going to see both.", "Gus: I'm sorry, I cannot put that ring on harley's finger.", "Michelle: Do you know cpr?", "Tony: Yeah, michelle.", "Michelle: Okay, get over here. I need you to alternate with me. Come on. Don't think about it, just do it.", "Tony: Okay.", "Michelle: Come on. Take over right there.", "Rick: What's going on? What happened?", "Bellman: He collapsed going up the stairs.", "Rick: Michelle, is he going to be okay? Do you need me to help out here?", "Michelle: I think we got it. The paramedics are on their way.", "Rick: Good. Good job.", "Tony: Come on, man. Come on, man.", "Michelle: Come on, come on.", "Mitchell: (Gasps)", "Michelle: Okay, okay, all right.", "Rick: Nice work, tony. Good job.", "Michelle: Do you know what his name is?", "Bellman: Mr. Mitchell. Charlie, I think.", "Michelle: Charlie? Charlie, you're going to be okay, all right? (Sirens wailing in the distance) you're going to be fine. All right? Then you're going to quit smoking and you're going to go to a gym. But most importantly, you're going to let the bellman carry your stupid bags.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: No, I get what you're saying. No, I do. I do. And whoever michelle is, we'll find out together.", "Mel: Danny, michelle has to find out who she is on her own, okay? You can't force it. Look, I am so sorry. I did not mean to put a damper on things, okay?", "Danny: No. Hey, mel, I asked for your advice. Really. It's not your fault I don't like it.", "Mel: (Laughs)", "Danny: It's okay.", "Mel: Look, danny, chances are michelle is going to get her memory back, okay? It's just going to take some time. You have to be patient.", "Danny: It might sound kind of crazy.", "Mel: What?", "Danny: No, no.", "Mel: What?", "Danny: Well, sometimes i think it might be better if michelle never remembers. You know, I'm responsible for a lot of bad memories.", "Mel: Good ones, too.", "Danny: Yeah, but why not just lose the bad for good. Start fresh, fall in love all over again.", "Mel: It actually sounds kind of exciting.", "Danny: Right. She gets to know me, I get to know her. I already know we're meant to be together.", "Mel: Yeah, we all do. But you've got to go easy on her, okay?", "Danny: Okay, okay, okay, i can do that. I can. You know, I think that if you can find one great love in your life, you can die happy.", "Mel: I'm with you there.", "Danny: How lucky am I? I've found mine twice. So... this memory thing is not going to get in our way. It's not. Nothing is.", "Mel: Well, I just hope michelle remembers one thing.", "Danny: What's that?", "Mel: How lucky she is to have you. Look, I better go. All right, good luck with everything.", "Danny: Hey, thanks.", "Mel: Bye, sweetie.", "Danny: Thank you. Okay, see you later.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alexandra: Marjorie.", "Marjorie: I got here as quickly as I could. Here it is.", "Alexandra: All right, and of course this conversation, this meeting never took place.", "Marjorie: What conversation?", "Alexandra: Oh, dear, dear. Darci, you're so photogenic. However, I wish I could say the same about mr. Green and mr. Salerno.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: They're beautiful.", "Gus: You like those?", "Harley: Sure.", "Gus: How much did they set you back, big al?", "Alan: They've been in the family for generations, gus. My father brandon and my mother penelope were the last ones to wear those.", "Harley: Wow, they must be worth a fortune.", "Alan: Oh, yes, a small fortune.", "Harley: Wait a minute. How come I never saw these rings when I married phillip or alan- michael?", "Alan: Because I never accepted you into the family, harley, remember? Until now. And I think we have this man right here to thank for that.", "Harley: Yes, we do.", "Gus: Can I talk to you just for one...?", "Harley: Sure.", "Gus: Thanks. Honey, you like these rings?", "Harley: Sure.", "Gus: Yeah? I mean, because they represent... they have a lot of history, right? It's like a whole spaulding history, so you're okay with wearing that on your finger?", "Harley: Can I have a minute to think about this? I need to make a call.", "Gus: Well, yeah. Take all the time that you want. Big al, we can't accept these rings.", "Alan: Why not?", "Gus: Because every time i look down at her hand, when I'm holding it or whatever, I am going to be reminded of what i had to do to protect this family, how I had to break the law, how I had to lie to her. No, I'm sorry. I cannot put that ring on harley's finger.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: Nice job, michelle. Very nice job. You still got it.", "Michelle: Yeah, I do.", "Rick: Listen, I told the paramedics I'd follow them to cedars. I'll call you and let you know how he's doing, okay?", "Michelle: Yeah. Thanks.", "Tony: See you, rick.", "Rick: See you.", "Tony: So, do you want to get out of here?", "Michelle: Yeah, you read my mind.", "Tony: You were amazing there, you know? You were.", "Michelle: I can remember how to save someone's life, but i can't remember my own husband or my own child. How is that?", "Tony: Well, you know, michelle, I just think that... honestly, I think you're trying too hard to remember, and if you just maybe not think about it for a while, it will all come back and you will. Okay?", "Michelle: I just feel so lost, tony. I just feel like I'm in a thick fog and I just can't see anything. You see that?", "Tony: The lighthouse out there? Yeah, I see it.", "Michelle: That's what I need. I need a light like that to guide me home.", "Tony: Well, you have one, you know. Your family owns that lighthouse out there.", "Michelle: Yeah, we own the lighthouse? Who? Who owns the lighthouse?", "Tony: Your family. They own it. They preserved it a few years ago.", "Michelle: And it works?", "Tony: Yeah, when it has to.", "Michelle: Have you been there?", "Tony: Yeah. Yeah, I've been there. So, do you remember it at all?", "Michelle: Not exactly.", "Tony: No?", "Michelle: But it feels familiar to me.", "Tony: It does? Well, I'll tell you something bout that lighthouse out there, michelle. You can see... you can see the whole town. From there, you can see everything.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: You know, tammy, i didn't steal your boyfriend away from you. And technically, he's not even your boyfriend anymore.", "Tammy: Not that that would matter to you.", "Lizzie: Look, I know the way it looks and I know you still want him back, okay, but we have a lot of reasons for going to the dance together.", "Marina: We'd love to hear them.", "Lizzie: All right. Well we're partners, all right? I wouldn't even have been here last night if it wasn't for the spaulding contest.", "Tammy: You're going to the dance for your project?", "Lizzie: Yeah. Isn't that the same reason why you're going to the dance with remy?", "Tammy: We're friends.", "Lizzie: With benefits, or...?", "Tammy: Are you kidding me?", "Marina: You know what, lizzie? I think it's a good thing that you and joey are going to the dance together. No, really. I mean, he'll hold you in his arms on the dance floor, and they'll put the spotlight on you, and as everyone's watching, he'll finally be able to see you for what you really are.", "Lizzie: I'm not ashamed of who I am.", "Marina: Of course not. You're elizabeth spaulding.", "Lizzie: Listen, tammy, okay? I'm sorry, but you can't let this get to you, all right? I know it hurts you that joey is slipping away from you, but you have to stay the same person. You were always so nice.", "Tammy: Yeah, look where it got me.", "Marina: Good point.", "Lizzie: Oh, well. Grandpa was right. Competitions really bring out the best in people, and the worst.", "Tammy: Well, then get ready because you are going to see both.", "Lizzie: What, is that like a challenge or something?", "Tammy: Bring it on.", "Lizzie: (Scoffs)", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: So, blake, I am sitting there and I am staring at these incredibly beautiful rings-- spaulding family heirlooms, really. I mean, they're amazing. No, not from gus. From alan. And I'm thinking these were worn by god knows how many spauldings, who did god knows how many horrible things. No, I'm not really suspicious of them anymore. I got my answer about alex. So, I'm over- thinking this, right? I mean, they're just a pair of rings, right?", "Alan: These rings are not a reminder of lies. They stand for life. They stand for family.", "Gus: What exactly does our family stand for?", "Alan: Why don't you tell me? You've been a part of it for a while.", "Gus: I will tell you what she loves about me. She loves my honesty. She loves my integrity.", "Alan: No, she doesn'T. She loves you for who you really are. Now, I know you feel like you're betraying her now, but you're not hurting her.", "Gus: What is that? Logic?", "Alan: We have shut down the drug pipeline. The world is now safe from the drug delirium and your aunt alexandra is safe, as well.", "Gus: The vow says, \"forsaking all others,\" right? I chose the others.", "Alan: No, you chose both. Your family and the woman that you love. Now, look, believe me, in five years, this integrity and honesty thing won't matter at all.", "Gus: What will?", "Alan: Your family, your children, and your life with harley. Well?", "Harley: It certainly does scream \"spaulding,\" doesn't it?", "Gus: Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but the answer is no.", "Harley: The answer is yes. (Laughs) yes. Alan...", "Alan: (Laughs)", "Harley: If you can accept me into your family, it is high time I accepted you into mine. (Laughs)", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alexandra: Oh, frank.", "Frank: Alexandra.", "Alexandra: You're not surprised to see me?", "Frank: I am.", "Alexandra: Well, don't be. I mean, look, I harbor no ill will about yesterday. You've got a job to do.", "Frank: Yes, I do.", "Alexandra: But something tells me you do have some more questions.", "Frank: Really? Something or somebody?", "Buzz: Frank, let's put it on the table. Ask the questions. You're willing to sit down again, aren't you?", "Alexandra: Whatever it takes, but I think I've already told you everything of any importance at all I can tell you.", "Frank: You know, alexandra, i appreciate the offer, but I have a file to report here, so... pop, thanks for the food. I appreciate it.", "Buzz: Frank, frank, frank. Come on. We're all going to be spending a lot of time together. Let's move along here. Let's look ahead.", "Alexandra: Hey, you tried. You tried.", "Buzz: Oh, forget about him. So, shall we take one car or you follow me?", "Alexandra: Fine, I'll follow you. But give me a minute. I've got just a couple of little calls to make, all right?", "Frank: Alexandra, exactly what are you doing?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: You like that? You like that ring?", "Harley: They're beautiful.", "Gus: Yeah? You sure?", "Harley: Well, I'm sure if you're sure.", "Gus: Hm. Okay. All right, then. Good.", "Alan: I'll be proud for you to wear them at your wedding.", "Gus: You'll be proud?", "Alan: Mm-hmm.", "Harley: Honey, it's not about two gold bands. This is about moving on. This is about letting go of the bad stuff.", "Alan: A fresh start, hm?", "Harley: Exactly. Not to mention these rings are gorgeous.", "Alan: Well, I always knew you had good taste, harley.", "Harley: Are you going to start rewriting history now, alan?", "Alan: All right, all right, all right. I'm learning that you have good taste.", "Harley: Thank you. I'll take that.", "Gus: Well, I'll tell you what. Since we have handled the spaulding part of this, right, i think it's high time that we handled the cooper part.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alexandra: I was looking for my sunglasses.", "Frank: They're on top of your head.", "Alexandra: What? Oh. (Laughs) thank you. Honestly, I'd forget my head, i suppose, if it wasn't attached.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cop: Hey, chief. It's aitoro for you, line one.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Frank: Thank you. Yeah, gus, what is it?", "Gus: I have a favor to ask of you, and well, it'S... you know, it's kind of a special one.", "Frank: Okay, what's up?", "Gus: Well, I don't know if you heard, you know, but I'm marrying your little sister. We have pretty much everything that we need, except for one thing: A best man. And I was kind of, you know, wondering if you were up for that, for that job.", "Frank: You want me to be your best man?", "Gus: Yes. Yes, I would like that, you know. The thing is, frank, you know, you tell a pretty lame joke, but still and all, it would be dull without you. So I would be honored if you would say yes.", "Frank: Well, gus, I'm honored to say yes. Of course, I'd love to. Listen, gus, I'm sorry I've been really hard on you and your family about this whole spaulding drug case, but I just really want you and harley to be happy, that's all.", "Gus: Well, we will be. We will be.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alexandra: Oh, I'm sorry, buzz. It's your family or mine. It's all ready. Everything is in place. Oh, wait, wait, wait.", "Buzz: She'll call you back.", "Alexandra: I was almost finished.", "Buzz: Enough is enough. It's time to have a life.", "Alexandra: Oh, come on. One more. I mean, it just...", "Buzz: It's time to hit the stores, pick the perfect wedding gift.", "Alexandra: All right, but this is really important. Just...", "Buzz: More important than me?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tony: This is your place. It's cool, huh?", "Michelle: Mm-hmm. Can I go up there?", "Tony: Fire away. Do your thing.", "Michelle: Wow. Tony, I can see everything. Next, on \"guiding light,\"", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: This is the part where you say that you haven't been avoiding me and that you're sorry you haven't returned my calls.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: I'm not sorry.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: It's beautiful. Are you trying to buy me?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: Joey thinks that he's so cool, but deep down you can tell that he's just a scared little boy."], "Transcript Author": ["By Boo"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyDE244rod0"}
