        "Alan: Anyone follow us?",
        "Sebastian: No. No, we're good.",
        "Alan: Whew! Sebastian, I owe you my life.",
        "Sebastian: ( Laughs ) Yes, you do, my friend.",
        "Alan: How did you pull that off?",
        "Sebastian: Well, it was a rather arresting performance, wouldn't you say?",
        "Alan: If you hadn't come when you did, they were going to haul me off...",
        "Sebastian: You'd be spending the rest of your life in state prison, Alan.",
        "Alan: Yeah. Once again, Gus betrayed me. And I'm not going to forgive him for this. He knows I would not hurt Phillip for anything.",
        "Sebastian: Save it. Save it, Alan, for if you ever see a jury. But right now we've got to get out of here, because-- whew-- we're running out of time. We've been running away from the cops all night. They're bound to catch up to us.",
        "Alan: I need my passport, and there's one stop that I need to make. But I want you to call my pilot and have him prepare my jet.",
        "Sebastian: Not so fast, Alan. We have a few things to settle first.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Lizzie. Lizzie, I just heard the news about your grandfather. I am so, so sorry. I knew I should have been there with you. I'm so... I'm so sorry.",
        "Lizzie: He killed my father.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, I... I am so sorry for all of this.",
        "Lizzie: You know, I just keep seeing... I keep seeing my granddad with a gun and the trigger going off... and then my daddy. I wasn't even there and I keep seeing it.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, you've got to stop this, okay. Please?",
        "Lizzie: You know what, though? Harley's home. That's good.",
        "Coop: Yeah. Yeah, it is. But I'm more worried about you right now than I am Harley, okay?",
        "Lizzie: Uh-huh. But it's good, though. Daddy would have wanted that. He would have wanted her to be safe. Do you not see how crazy this family is, though? Like, every time I think it can't get worse, it always does.",
        "Beth: Oh, sweetie. I am so... so sorry.",
        "Lizzie: How can he say that family means everything to him when he did what he did to Dad?",
        "Beth: I don't know. I just don't know. Come on.",
        "Lizzie: No! No, I'm never going back there again, ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Hey.",
        "Olivia: Hi.",
        "Reva: What is going on around here? Something about Alan?",
        "Olivia: Alan killed Phillip.",
        "Reva: Oh, my God. I... I can't believe it.",
        "Olivia: I was here. I heard him confess.",
        "Reva: But why? Why would he kill Phillip?",
        "Olivia: You know what? I don't know. I don't know. This family is destined to destroy each other. Sorry, I know it's a little bitter, but that unholy mother was trying to pin the whole thing on me. I swear to you, if he fries, I'm bringing the ketchup.",
        "Reva: Well, now, when will Harley be released?",
        "Olivia: Soon, I guess.",
        "Reva: Well, at least that's good news.",
        "Olivia: Yeah. I don't really want to talk about it anymore, okay? So what's going on with the whole Alfred/Nate situation?",
        "Reva: Nothing. I don't have anything yet. But I will.",
        "Olivia: You will?",
        "Reva: Yeah. Because I have an idea...",
        "Olivia: Uh-huh.",
        "Reva: ...And we have to act quickly before Jonathan gets hurt again.",
        "Olivia: If that's what really happened.",
        "Reva: What do you mean, \"if\"? I've seen the bruises.",
        "Olivia: Look, I know that both Jonathan and my sister were terrorized by that animal, but Jonathan was raised to be Alfred's partner in crime.",
        "Reva: What are you saying?",
        "Olivia: I'm saying that the more I think about it, the more I believe that Jonathan may know something about my sister's death.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: What took you so long? I paged you half an hour ago.",
        "Jonathan: I didn't get any message from you.",
        "Nate: I thought I taught you a lesson that stuck the other night at Reva's place.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I got it, all right? A lot of other people got it, too.",
        "Nate: You've been spreading the word, Johnny? Really?",
        "Jonathan: Really.",
        "Nate: Good. Because we have to wrap up business here before Reva catches on. You can't be too careful.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I've been careful. You're the one that decided you wanted to get her into bed.",
        "Nate: Oh, yeah. I've seen the error of my ways.",
        "Jonathan: Meaning?",
        "Nate: Never you mind. You just do what you're told.",
        "Jonathan: What are you working on?",
        "Nate: I'm just doodling. Whenever I want to clear my head and concentrate on the big picture, I doodle.",
        "Jonathan: Was it that you didn't come here for anything like this. You came here for money, cash. Let's stick to the plan.",
        "Nate: Plans changed, son.",
        "Jonathan: Let's get what you came for and get out.",
        "Nate: Oh, we're going to get what I came for. Don't you worry about that. We're even going to turn a nice little profit on that trust money you gave me to buy this bar. But my little visit here was always about more than money, Johnny. You know this.",
        "Jonathan: It was never about this. At least you never said so.",
        "Nate: You know, I don't... I don't like it when you question my motives. Whatever I do, I do it for you.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah? So what's the plan, Dad? You're going to do Reva like you did my mom?",
        "Nate: I came here to help my little boy, and that's exactly what I'm going to do. But part of being a good parent, having to make tough choices...",
        "Jonathan: Like choosing to kill Marissa? Was that tough? Be you've been practicing ever since I can remember.",
        "Nate: You have to stop living in the past. You've got to focus, son. We got a job to do.",
        "Jonathan: Not like this.",
        "Nate: Please, wake up. Reva doesn't want you. She chucked you out like garbage, stinking garbage. She still thinks of you as stinking garbage. They all do.",
        "Jonathan: Reva tried to save my life.",
        "Nate: Shut up! Shut up. I don't want to hear that, we are going to give her what she deserves.",
        "Jonathan: Where are you going?",
        "Nate: You just stay here. And the next time I send you a message, I expect you to answer it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Aunt Reva.",
        "Reva: Tammy. I didn't see you come in. You probably shouldn't be hearing this.",
        "Reva: Look, Olivia, Jonathan had nothing to do with Marissa's death, he loved her. She was his mother.",
        "Tammy: He did love his mother, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: Yes, and Marissa loved him. I don't want to think this of Jonathan, okay? I've already lost one family member.",
        "Reva: My son has problems, okay? Issues. But he's not a murderer.",
        "Tammy: I agree with you, Aunt Reva. But...",
        "Olivia: What? What? What do you know?",
        "Tammy: Nothing. Nothing about your sister. I... I just... I saw Jonathan at the computer at Lewis and he was doing something, but whatever it was, he didn't want me to know about it. He seemed freaked out.",
        "Reva: I'm sure it had nothing to do with any of this.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, fine. He didn't kill anyone.",
        "Olivia: Alfred raised him. Alfred's been posing as Nate for quite some time. Jonathan knew that you were working with him, yet he didn't say anything.",
        "Reva: He did. He tried to talk me off that job and away from Nate several times.",
        "Olivia: He never exposed Nate, which means he's protecting him, which means he could know something.",
        "Reva: That creep beat on my kid for years. There was a reason why he didn't expose Nate, and it was because he was scared.",
        "Olivia: Because he was scared, which means he would go along with his father's plan. I just need to talk to Jonathan. I just need to feel him out.",
        "Reva: Nate did this. He killed your sister, and I'll prove it if you help me.",
        "Olivia: If I help you set him up.",
        "Reva: He's a bully. I know how to deal with bullies.",
        "Olivia: Really? Then why did it take you so long to figure out who he was? He has been playing you for weeks.",
        "Reva: I admit that I was taken in at first.",
        "Olivia: Taken in? Reva, he had you wrapped around his little finger. The way I see it, good old Nate is setting you up to be his next victim.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I said I don't want to see the place ever again, okay? People go crazy there. First it was Daddy, now it's Granddad, and I won't go crazy. It won't.",
        "Beth: Okay, okay. I know that you're upset, but you can't run away from this. We need each other right now, and if your father were alive today...",
        "Lizzie: Well, he's not, okay? My grandfather killed him. Do you not see that our family's cursed? At I'm never going back there, ever. I'm sorry.",
        "Coop: Look, maybe Lizzie just needs a little bit of time.",
        "Lizzie: I just want to be with Coop, please.",
        "Beth: May I have a word with you? You have no idea what you're dealing with. Lizzie isn't like other young",
        "Coop: Oh, we've talked about this before, all right? Don't try to scare me off by telling me that Lizzie's different.",
        "Beth: Her whole life has been filled with disappointment. We have all let her down in one way or another, but now this? Her grandfather killing her father? If you care about her as much as you do, you won't work against me. Do you care about her? Do you?",
        "Coop: Yes. Yes, of course I care about Lizzie.",
        "Beth: Then let me help her. I'm her mother. I know best. She'll call you. Let's go, Lizzie. Come on. You need to get something to eat.",
        "Lizzie: I'm not hungry.",
        "Beth: Honey, Nana also needs us right now and she's back at the house.",
        "Lizzie: Mom, I don't want to...",
        "Beth: Let's go.",
        "Lizzie: Coop, please tell her.",
        "Beth: Come on.",
        "Lizzie: Coop?",
        "Beth: Come on, Sweetie. Come on, Sweetie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: I'm sure you realized that everything's changed. Turn on the TV.",
        "Alan: Why should I turn on the TV?",
        "Sebastian: Well, right about now you're on just about every single station. \"Alan Spaulding, the billionaire that shot his son.\" \"Alan Spaulding, armed, dangerous and on the run.\"",
        "Alan: What do you want?",
        "Sebastian: I just want you to acknowledge that your life as you knew it is over.",
        "Alan: All right. And, so?",
        "Sebastian: Well, Alan, let's see. You can keep your big cigars and screwed up family and your messed up relationships. All I want is your money and your power. Oh, and did I mention your money?",
        "Alan: So, me treating you as if you were my own son is not good enough, is it? I had a father, Alan, in case you've forgotten. And I made a vow to him on his deathbed, everything you own would belong to his son. And you know what? I don't know where Roger is right now, but I do know this. Wherever he is, he is looking down at me and he is smiling with pride. Hey, Dad, Alan's sweating, isn't he?",
        "Alan: Tell your dad his son is dreaming.",
        "Sebastian: ( Laughs ) Oh, come now, Alan. Let's be reasonable. You need to escape. I'm going to help you do that. In return, you're going to hand over Spaulding Enterprises.",
        "Alan: Spaulding Enterprise.",
        "Sebastian: Oh, yeah. I had a contract drawn up. So all you need to do is sign on pages one and three. I'll own your company and you'll have your freedom.",
        "Alan: Do you have any idea who you're dealing? If I shot my own son, why would I think twice about killing you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: I can't do this anymore.",
        "Lizzie: I'm right here.",
        "Coop: Oh, hey. I was so worried about you. I... I... I just needed to know that you're okay.",
        "Lizzie: Okay? You let my mom take me off to that awful house.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, I've been fighting your family, and that's not going to help us. Alright, maybe, maybe your mom was right, and maybe you needed to go home. Maybe you need to face what's happening. I don't know.",
        "Lizzie: No, that's not going to happen, okay. If you don't want me here, that's fine. I'll go somewhere else.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, it's not that I don't want you here. Of course I want you with me. I don't want to make things worse for you.",
        "Lizzie: That's not going to happen. It's already been done.",
        "Coop: Wait. Where's your mom?",
        "Lizzie: I took my own car. I lost her at the first traffic light.",
        "Coop: Which means?.",
        "Lizzie: Well, can you hide me?",
        "Coop: Lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: Coop, I need you. Just please let me stay here, okay. Nobody has to know that I'm in your room. Please.",
        "Coop: ( Sighs )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Look, I know that Nate is dangerous, which is why I want him off the streets.",
        "Olivia: Maybe Jonathan is dangerous, too. We don't know.",
        "Reva: I know. I know my son. He's angry and he's troubled, but he'd never do anything to hurt your sister. I know that. Fine. You know what? Fine. But at least help me find the truth.",
        "Olivia: How?",
        "Reva: By bringing in Nate.",
        "Olivia: What do you want me to do?",
        "Reva: I want you to lure him to the house.",
        "Olivia: Your house?",
        "Reva: Yes.",
        "Olivia: Where you would be alone with him?",
        "Reva: Only until I can set the trap.",
        "Olivia: I don't like it.",
        "Reva: And then I want you to come over and I want you to punch me in the face a couple of times.",
        "Olivia: I'm a little more interested.",
        "Reva: Okay. Enough to make it look like Nate attacked me.",
        "Olivia: Let me get this straight. You want me to punch you in the face a few times to make it look...",
        "Reva: You would never go too far with this, okay?",
        "Olivia: Well, I'm just saying that dreams really do come true for the girl.",
        "Reva: Well, I think you're enjoying this a little too much. What you do is you call me...",
        "Reva: No. Don't look. Just keep your eyes on me.",
        "Olivia: What are we going to do?",
        "Reva: We're going to argue.",
        "Olivia: Hm.",
        "Reva: We're going to argue and then you're going to go out the backdoor and then I'm going to call you when everything is set. ( Loudly ) I can't believe you, Olivia. Look, I'm sorry about what happened to your sister, but to blame my son is unheard of. ( Softly ) Go, now.",
        "Olivia: This isn't over, not by a long shot.",
        "Reva: Nate. Oh, thank God. Oh.",
        "Nate: What's wrong, Reva?",
        "Reva: Oh, my God. Everything. Everything is wrong. Olivia, Jonathan's aunt, thinks that Jonathan had something to do with her sister's death.",
        "Nate: Olivia.",
        "Reva: Olivia. Oh, I'm sorry. You haven't met her yet. She is Marissa's sister. Marissa, being Jonathan's adoptive mother.",
        "Nate: Oh, right. The one that...",
        "Reva: That drowned, yes. And I think she's going to pin it on Jonathan, call in the cops.",
        "Nate: You think she will?",
        "Reva: Well, I don't know.",
        "Nate: Well, if Jonathan's innocent it doesn't matter what this Olivia does, does it?",
        "Reva: If? If he's innocent? Of course he's innocent.",
        "Nate: You sure?",
        "Reva: Yes. Yes, I am.",
        "Nate: Okay.",
        "Reva: No, don't you... don't you do that. Not you. I have all these accusations coming at me from all different sides.",
        "Nate: Reva, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.",
        "Reva: No, it's not you. It's not even Jonathan.",
        "Nate: Then what is it?",
        "Reva: It's Josh. He's furious with me.",
        "Nate: Why?",
        "Reva: Because of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Do you think I'm going to be like them? Like my dad, my granddad?",
        "Coop: No.",
        "Lizzie: Do you think I'll be crazy, too?",
        "Coop: No, I don't.",
        "Lizzie: Well, what if it... what if it doesn't until I get older?",
        "Coop: Lizzie, it's not going to happen.",
        "Lizzie: How do you know that, Coop?",
        "Coop: I... I just do.",
        "Lizzie: You always have this way of just making me feel so safe.",
        "Coop: Well, you are safe. And you can stay here with me as long as you want, right here with me.",
        "Lizzie: You're probably the only person who doesn't think I'm going to end up being nuts.",
        "Coop: No, I'm not the only one.",
        "Lizzie: Well, Coop, you... you know me, you get me, and you're probably the only one. I like being around you.",
        "Coop: That's good, because I need to be with you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: I'm not afraid of you, Alan.",
        "Alan: Then you're not as smart as I thought you were.",
        "Sebastian: Save it, Alan. We both know that you're far more terrified of going to prison than I am of facing death. Or have you kicked that nasty little case of claustrophobia?",
        "Alan: So disappointed in you, Sebastian, because I had high hopes for you. But you have turned out to be exactly like your father.",
        "Sebastian: Yes, Alan. I am. I am exactly like my father. And I am nothing, nothing like you. Now, you sign this contract right now and we can leave. Or, if you want, you can read it over and risk the cops showing up to catch us. It's up to you.",
        "Alan: This is ridiculous. You leave my family nothing.",
        "Sebastian: Oh, no, Alan.... Alan, I think you did that. But if it's any consolation, if it makes you feel any better, we'll keep your portrait up in the lobby. Now sign the contract, Alan, before I change my mind and leave you cooking in the electric chair like a big old pot roast.",
        "Cop: Open up. Police.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I know my son. He's angry and he's troubled, but he'd never do anything to hurt your sister. I know that.",
        "Olivia: Hey.",
        "Jonathan: Hi, Aunt Livvy.",
        "Olivia: How are you holding up?",
        "Jonathan: I'm okay, I guess. What choice do I have?",
        "Olivia: Yeah. Yeah, bourbon. Make it a double. Neat. Water back.",
        "Jonathan: Serious stuff.",
        "Olivia: It's been kind of a serious day.",
        "Jonathan: You upset about mom?",
        "Olivia: Yeah. Well, come on, I lost my sister. Then, to top it all off, Alan... Alan confessed. You know, it turns out he's the one who killed Phillip.",
        "Jonathan: No way!",
        "Olivia: Yeah.",
        "Jonathan: His own son?",
        "Olivia: His own son.",
        "Jonathan: Fathers, huh?",
        "Olivia: Yeah. Those fathers. And he's running around free, setting everyone up, as you well know. Harley's in prison. I'm jumping through hoops. And all along, you know, it was him. It turned out he killed the one person he said he loved the most. Can you imagine that?",
        "Jonathan: Love and hate, they're supposed to be part of the same emotion, aren't they?",
        "Olivia: I don't know. Are they?",
        "Jonathan: Only thing that matter is that it's solved.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, yeah. Except there seems to me people... people assume they can get away with murder. You know, they're so sure that they've covered all their bases, but in the end it always comes out, Jonathan. It always comes out.",
        "Jonathan: You seem pretty upset about all of this, huh?",
        "Olivia: Why wouldn't I be?",
        "Jonathan: Well, I don't know. The last time I talked to you, you didn't give a damn about Phillip Spaulding or his father.",
        "Olivia: I was married to Phillip. Emma's his daughter. I...",
        "Jonathan: You loved him.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, I did once. But he changed.",
        "Jonathan: You ask me, he got what he deserved. You know, I don't even know why you care.",
        "Olivia: Because I think it's wrong for someone to kill a member of their own family. I think it's wrong to go around lying about it. Making sure those people get what they deserve, that's right.",
        "Jonathan: So it's a... it's a moral thing with you?",
        "Olivia: Isn't it with you? I mean, come on. Don't you want the person who hurt Marissa to pay for it?",
        "Jonathan: I don't want to talk about it.",
        "Olivia: All right. Then let's talk about me. What do you know about me? What I used to be like?",
        "Jonathan: I don't know. Well, you told me you're my aunt. You used to remember my birthdays. I liked you.",
        "Olivia: But you were a child. You only saw part of me. I acted so tough because I thought that was the only way I could act to survive, especially here in Springfield. Nobody would give me anything, so I just would... I would just take it. And then Bill came along and he offered me something different, something better.",
        "Jonathan: Why are you telling me all of this?",
        "Olivia: Because I think we're more alike then we are different. I found something worth holding on to. Maybe you haven't or maybe you have and you just don't recognize it yet. But when you do, Jonathan, you got to hold on to it and never let it go. You understand?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Yeah, I get you.",
        "Olivia: I'm sorry about your mother. She loved you.",
        "Jonathan: ( Crying ) I loved her, too.",
        "Olivia: Did you really, Jonathan?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. I mean, I wish she was stronger at sometimes, but she was my mom.",
        "Olivia: She... she hated the water. She couldn't swim. And it's just very strange how she drowned. And I'm just... I'm curious, you know. Do you have any idea how that might have happened? Yeah. Well, I guess, you know, it's done and we can't change it, right? So...",
        "Jonathan: No, can't change it.",
        "Olivia: But we can do something about the future, right? I mean, if we want to, we can fix things. We can't sit around and watch when people decide that they can get away with murder. I've got to go. Buy me a drink, will you? I'll see you.",
        "Jonathan: You're right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I was wrong. Josh isn't okay with our relationship. He left town. We had an argument and he left me.",
        "Nate: He left you?",
        "Reva: Yeah. He's gone and I don't know if he's ever coming back again. I told him about the kiss. It was stupid.",
        "Nate: Oh. Reva, you were just trying to be honest. Look, you can't blame yourself for this.",
        "Reva: Oh, but I do. I do blame myself. I wanted life to be exciting, you know, but I ended up pushing my husband away. And now he's gone and I don't know how I can live my life without him.",
        "Nate: Reva, come here. You're going to be okay. With or without Josh.",
        "Reva: Don't say that.",
        "Nate: It's true. All right, look, you're his wife. No way he's going to let you go without a fight. No way.",
        "Reva: But I betrayed him, Nate. You know, I thought that I could control everything, but I've made everything even worse.",
        "Nate: No, you haven't. It was me. I should never have told you how I felt. All I did was make it worse.",
        "Reva: No, you can't blame yourself. It was... it was me. I ruined my life and I ruined my marriage.",
        "Nate: Well. Reva, sorry. I had no idea. If there's anything I can do. Anything.",
        "Reva: Yeah. Everyone believes that Josh is this sensitive, forgiving man, but he's been hurt and he... he can be vindictive.",
        "Nate: I won't let him hurt you.",
        "Reva: Oh, he wouldn't hurt me, not physically. But he could hurt me in another way: Financially. I was a big part of Lewis Construction. I helped make that company, and I'm entitled to the money.",
        "Nate: Yeah, of course you are.",
        "Reva: Well, Josh may not see it that way. You know, he could take it before I have the chance to put it somewhere, you know, like... I don't know. Transfer it. But I wouldn't even know where to send it.",
        "Nate: Let me get this straight. You want to take money from your husband's company and deposit it somewhere?",
        "Reva: Yes, somewhere he can't get at it. But I can't put it in my own personal account.",
        "Nate: No, he'd be on you like white on rice. Let me think about this.",
        "Reva: Oh, no, I really don't want to dump my problems on you.",
        "Nate: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Hey, I got an idea. What about the Outskirts account?",
        "Reva: Oh, no, I wouldn't want you to get into any trouble.",
        "Nate: All is I need is a password to the Lewis account.",
        "Reva: Password?",
        "Nate: Don't you have one?",
        "Reva: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm sure it's in the house somewhere.",
        "Nate: What are we waiting for? Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Okay, okay. Wait a minute, wait a minute. You need to get some rest, so why don't you go ahead and take Michelle's old room?",
        "Lizzie: Coop, I really don't think I'm going to be able to nap right now.",
        "Coop: I will be right down the hall, okay? So if you need to talk, just come get me.",
        "Lizzie: I don't know what I'd do without you.",
        "Coop: Well, I'm not going anywhere, so...",
        "Lizzie: You know, I want to believe that so bad. It's just, you know, with everything...",
        "Coop: Right.",
        "Lizzie: You know, I really know my granddad loved my dad. It's just... I know he did.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, bad things happen, okay? One bad move can change a life forever, and that's just how it is.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, but I mean he blamed it on so many people. If it was an accident and he didn't mean to pull the trigger, then he should have said something.",
        "Coop: I know. Okay, you don't need to convince me. I agree. But that is something that you and I are not going to figure out right now. And so the best thing for you is to get some rest. So please, for me, go take a nap. Come on.",
        "Lizzie: Okay.",
        "Coop: All right.",
        "Lizzie: Wait. I need to get my bag.",
        "Coop: Don't worry about it. You go ahead. I'll bring it up to you. ( Cell phone rings) Hello?",
        "Beth: Coop, is that you?",
        "Coop: Yeah.",
        "Beth: Where's Lizzie?",
        "Coop: She's here with me. She's safe. Don't worry.",
        "Beth: At the Bauer house?",
        "Coop: She asked if she could stay, actually.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: Hey, what's up?",
        "Cop: They want me to confiscate Alan Spaulding's passport.",
        "Sebastian: You're kidding. This is supposed to be my collar.",
        "Cop: I just got the order a few minutes ago.",
        "Sebastian: Oh, man. You know, brass is so up in arms over this one, it's like... you know how it is. The right hand doesn't know what the left hand's doing. It's like organized chaos, man. Listen, I got this under control. So if you want, slip off, get yourself a donut, a cup of coffee, mums the word.",
        "Cop: Thanks. You're aces.",
        "Sebastian: ( Laughs ) You owe me one. Alan? The coast is clear. Alan?",
        "Alan: Your harder headed than your father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Lizzie just came straight over here.",
        "Beth: Okay. At least she's safe.",
        "Coop: Yeah, she's... she's safe here.",
        "Beth: I'll be right over to pick her up.",
        "Coop: No. No, please, you can't do that. I promised her that she could stay here.",
        "Beth: Coop, maybe I'm being selfish, but this has been terrible for me as well. I need my daughter.",
        "Coop: And she needs you, too. But, please, if you could just give her some time, maybe a day, so that she could kind of calm down a bit. Please.",
        "Beth: I know that... that being with you is not the right thing for her right now. But I also know that if I race over there I'm just going to drive her away.",
        "Coop: Look, it's not like we're alone here, okay? There are millions of people inside, so...",
        "Beth: Just have her call me when she can.",
        "Coop: I will. And I promise. And please don't worry. Lizzie's safe here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Oh, Hi, Beth.",
        "Beth: Hi, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: I guess my Aunt Reva left already.",
        "Beth: Yeah, I guess so. Are you all right?",
        "Tammy: Yeah. I just wanted to talk to her about someone that we both know who could be in trouble.",
        "Beth: Seems to be a lot of that going around.",
        "Tammy: Are you okay?",
        "Beth: No, not really.",
        "Tammy: Can I help?",
        "Beth: Can you go pick up Lizzie and bring her home where she belongs?",
        "Tammy: Probably not. You're really worried about her, huh?",
        "Beth: I want to give her the benefit of the doubt, but I just can't.",
        "Tammy: I know the feeling.",
        "Beth: You know, ever since Phillip died I just... I feel like I'm the only one that understands her, and I want to protect her.",
        "Tammy: It's hard when you care so much about someone and you can't do anything for them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I don't think I could do this even if I tried.",
        "Nate: Well, this is nothing. Transferring funds from one account to another, it's so easy. All I need is the password to Lewis Construction.",
        "Reva: I owe you for this.",
        "Nate: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You don't owe me. \"Harland\"?",
        "Reva: Yeah, that's Josh's daddy. He started Lewis Oil.",
        "Nate: Well, there we go. In a few moments, all your assets will be safely in my account.",
        "Reva: It's really so sad, you know. I mean, Joshua and I were suppose to grow old together, raise our grandchildren, watch them grow up. And I ruined everything.",
        "Nate: Josh will come around.",
        "Reva: I don't know. It's different this time. I need to get some air.",
        "Nate: I'll come with you.",
        "Reva: No, no. No, that's fine. I really need to be alone.",
        "Nate: ( Laughs ) Sweet mother of God, this is just too easy.",
        "Reva: Okay, Olivia, get your knuckles ready and get the police over here. Your brother-in-law is robbing us blind.",
        "Olivia: You can't sit around and watch when people decide that they can get away with murder.",
        "Jonathan: Easy for you to say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: ( Screams )",
        "Alan: Be quiet, Olivia, or I'll send you on a trip to visit Phillip!",
        "Olivia: Let me out of here! Let me out! ( Olivia knocking on the door ) ( Cell phone ringing )",
        "Reva: Olivia, pick up the phone. I have him right where we want him. ( Phone rings )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: What do you want? I'm really busy.",
        "Jonathan: Well, get unbusy and get the hell out of there.",
        "Nate: Since when do you give the orders?",
        "Jonathan: She's on to you, man. Reva knows who you are. You've got to get out of there while you still can. _Next on \"Guiding Light.\" _",
        "Edmund: Put that back on, Dinah. I am warning you. Cassie is taking everything I have. And right now all I want to do is take everything away from her. I need you desperately, Dinah.",
        "Olivia: Oh, my God, Sebastian. Let me out of here.",
        "Reva: Come on, Olivia, pick up the phone.",
        "Nate: You're trying to set me up.",
        "Jonathan: Get out while you still can."
