        "Mallet: Oh, man, it's official. That's it,\r\nit's official. ",
        "Dinah: Not too soon, not too far away. It's\r\na perfect date. ",
        "Mallet: It's a perfect date. And you know\r\nwhat? I'm proud for both of us. I'm proud, because you know what? We decided\r\nwithout either of us freaking out. ",
        "Dinah: Right or acting out. ",
        "Mallet: Whew, wow. ",
        "Dinah: Yeah. ",
        "Mallet: Hey... I know that you've been\r\nburned before, you know, by me and by others. And I just wanted to let you know\r\nthat... that's our past, you know? This is our future. Right here, right now.\r\nOkay? ",
        "Dinah: Okay. I can't believe we're doing\r\nthis. We're really getting married. ",
        "Mallet: We're getting married! ",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs ) All right! Let's stop\r\nstanding around and talking. We've got a freaking wedding to plan! ",

        "Gus: So what tile do you want to go with,\r\nbabe, downstairs? The little bathroom? ",
        "Harley: Which one do you like? ",
        "Gus: Neutral. ",
        "Harley: Me, too. That's the one I was\r\nthinking, the neutral one with no color. ",
        "Gus: Neutral, yeah. But thought you liked\r\nthe blue one. ",
        "Harley: No, no, no, not the blue. Not the\r\npretty blue. I changed my mind about that. ",
        "Gus: You did? ",
        "Harley: What's next? ",
        "Gus: Um, yeah. Well, you were talking about\r\ncountertops, right? But everybody's going with granite, and you said granite.\r\nSince everyone's going with granite, I was thinking, why don't we just go back\r\nto the '80s and go butcher block. ",
        "Harley: Butcher block? ",
        "Gus: Yeah. ",
        "Harley: Butcher block? Butcher block. ",
        "Gus: Yes, butcher block. ",
        "Harley: Butcher block is great. I had a dream\r\nabout butcher block. That's perfect! That's perfect, why not? Butcher block!\r\nWhy not? ",
        "Gus: Really? So you're okay with that? ",
        "Harley: Yeah, yeah. Sounds beautiful. ",
        "Gus: That's great. ",
        "Harley: Isn't it funny, honey, it's like\r\never since we got back together, we agree on everything. We never argue. ",
        "Gus: Yeah, it's... great. ",

        "Reva: Going to be nice to get the heck out\r\nof this place. And I know I have to come back every day for treatment and\r\neverything, but this move, you know? To the hotel? It's not exactly like going\r\nhome, but it's certainly a lot closer than this place. ",
        "Billy: Hey, and the food's going to be a lot\r\nbetter, too. ",
        "Reva: I'm really hopeful. You know, and Colin\r\nalmost sounded positive, which for him is, you know, it's a big step. ",
        "Billy: ( Laughs ) That's like dancing on a\r\ntable. ",
        "Reva: Maybe this is it. Maybe I'm actually\r\ngoing to go into remission, you know? ",
        "Billy: Hey, why not? I mean, people are\r\ndoing it all the time, aren't they? ",
        "Reva: You know, I'm going to think of this\r\nmove to the hotel as a step on my journey back home, you know, to... to Josh. \r\n",
        "Billy: Hey, that's my girl. Tell you what,\r\nI'm going to go out and see if I can hurry your paperwork up, okay? ",
        "Reva: Thanks. ",
        "",
        "Josh: I just couldn't believe that moment\r\nwhen I'm trying to say to bellows, \"We need a commitment of at least one\r\nmillion dollars.\" And you pipe up with that Cassie smile of yours, and you\r\nsay, \"No, it's got to be at least two.\" ",
        "Cassie: Well, I'm sorry if I overstepped. ",
        "Josh: Overstepped? What are you talking\r\nabout? I think I owe you a raise now. ",
        "Cassie: Yeah, you got that right. ( Laughter\r\n) Or you could just be prepared to jump in with the bidding war for my\r\nservices. ",
        "Josh: A bidding war? ",
        "Cassie: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Josh: Ah. ",
        "Cassie: I've had a couple job offers. ",
        "Josh: Oh, no. ",
        "Cassie: You're not even worried that I'm\r\ngoing to go? ",
        "Josh: ( Laughs ) ",
        "Cassie: Great. Well, you don't have to\r\nworry. Yet. But I do have to go, actually. I told Blake that I would work at\r\nher booth at the summer festival in the park. Do you want to, maybe, come? I\r\nmean, R.J. is going to be there and he would love to see you. What am I talking\r\nabout? You've got work to do. I'm sorry. ( Cell phone rings ) ",
        "Josh: Just a second. Josh Lewis. ",
        "Reva: Hey, Bud. Guess who? ",
        "Josh: Reva. ",
        "Reva: It's good to hear your voice. ",
        "Josh: Same here. ",
        "Reva: How is everything? Are you okay? ",
        "Josh: Um... why wouldn't I be okay? ",
        "Reva: Well, because your name came up on my\r\ncaller ID the other day, and you didn't leave a message. ",
        "Josh: I see. So that's why you're calling\r\nme, because I called you. ",
        "Reva: Well, I mean, no. That's not the only\r\nreason. But... ",
        "Josh: Maybe you should call me just because\r\nI'm your husband. Or hey, you know what? Here's a crazy idea: Maybe you should\r\ntell me where you are and what you're doing for the same reason. Or even\r\nbetter... you should think about coming home. ",
        "Reva: Bud... ",
        "Josh: You know what... actually, I don't\r\nreally want to talk about this right now. Not like this, not on the phone. \r\n",
        "Reva: I think that's probably a good idea.\r\nSo how's everything else? How's everyone there? How's the hospital project\r\ngoing? How's Jonathan? ",
        "Josh: Are you blowing off Jonathan, too? ",
        "Reva: You know, I didn't really call to\r\nargue. ",
        "Josh: Then why did you call? ",
        "Reva: To tell you that I miss you. To tell\r\nyou that I love you, and I think about you all the time. ",
        "Josh: Hmm. ",
        "Reva: I've just been so busy. ",
        "Josh: Yeah, right... hanging out with your\r\nfriend, right? No, oh no, no, I'm sorry. You're not with your friend. You're in\r\nMinnesota on business with Billy. Hey, you know what? Say \"Hello\" to Billy\r\nfor me. ",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, I don't think this has\r\nbeen such a good idea. ",
        "Josh: Yeah, I agree. ",
        "Reva: I guess I should go. ",
        "Josh: Me, too, because you know what, Reva,\r\nI have a life. ",
        "Reva: I know you do. ",
        "Josh: Yeah, but the difference between you\r\nand me is that I actually want you to be a part of my life. So wherever you\r\nare, whatever you're doing, you take care of yourself, all right? Good-bye. \r\n",
        "Billy: Hey, you're all signed out. You okay?\r\nHoney, you want some water or something? ",
        "Reva: What I want is to get the hell out of\r\nhere. ",
        "Billy: Well, let's go. ",
        "",
        "Dinah: All right, we've got \"When.\"\r\nNext is \"Where.\" Which leads us to the question of \"How\r\nmany?\" ",
        "Mallet: How many... how many what? Oh, how\r\nmany people? ",
        "Dinah: How many guests, yes. How many people\r\nare going to be there watching me float down the aisle? Hopefully not looking\r\nlike a float. Honey, listen, we need to make our lists and compare them\r\ntomorrow, okay? ",
        "Mallet: Okay, that sounds good. What? ",
        "Dinah: No glazed look over your eye.\r\nStrangely enough, you don't look worried at all. ",
        "Mallet: Well, you know, I saved you from a\r\nburning building and I saved you from shooting a guy. ",
        "Dinah: Yes. ",
        "Mallet: And you forgave me for cheating on\r\nyou with my ex. And we fight, like, a dozen times a day, and that's when things\r\nare going well. So no, I'm not really worried. When it comes to all this, I'm not\r\nworried. So, I will do my guest list. And I will do the chores you asked me to\r\ndo, and I will meet you back here at 1600 hours. ",

        "Frank: I don't know. ",
        "Olivia: Well, you know, if you... at one\r\npoint you talked about taking Emma, and I'm... not pushing, I'm not. I just\r\nthought... ",
        "Frank: Look, Olivia, from now on, what\r\nhappens between you and my dad, happens. I just want you to be happy. But\r\nthere's no way I can pretend that we're pals again, okay, because we're not. \r\n",
        "Olivia: You've always been able to see the\r\nbest in me, Frank. I would've been happy with you. I felt safe with you. ",
        "Frank: Safe. There's a compliment, huh? ",
        "Olivia: It is a compliment. It's the biggest\r\nI can give you. ( Cell phone rings ) ",

        "Harley: I love a lot of your ideas about the\r\nhouse. It's like we're totally in synch. You know what I think? ",
        "Gus: Thanks. ",
        "Harley: I think that even though we were\r\napart, and it was really hard, it was actually better for us, because we now we\r\nlove each other even more, and we're even closer than we've ever been. And\r\nstuff like tiles and faucets and paint and things we'll probably have to live\r\nwith for years and years and years just doesn't seem to matter so much, right? \r\n",
        "Gus: Yeah, right. Babe, don't you have an\r\nerrand you said you wanted to run, or several errands? ",
        "Harley: Yeah, yeah, right. I... I should get\r\ngoing. ",

        "Dinah: Yeah. I'm very glad you're here. I'm\r\nglad you're here, because you know what? I need your help. Although Mallet has\r\nbeen unbelievably sweet and helpful through this whole thing, when it comes to\r\nwedding stuff, planning it, not so much. I know you've been married a bunch of\r\ntimes, so I figured maybe... sorry. Didn't mean it, didn't mean. ",
        "Harley: Whatever. What do you need help\r\nwith? What, what? ",
        "Dinah: Well, I need help with everything!\r\nYou know, Mallet wants a very simple and small wedding, which I think might be\r\nnice, too, but every time I try to make actual choices, everything starts\r\ngrowing. Hugely. You know, I start thinking about the church and I start\r\nthinking about the flowers, the music, the gown, you know? Getting on top of\r\nthat aisle and just watching everybody turn around and stare at me, you know?\r\nOh, God, I don't know, I think I'm turning into one of those brides. ( Laughs )\r\nAnd I think I like it! ",
        "Harley: You should like it. You should like\r\nit, and you should just do whatever you want. You've waited a really long time\r\nfor this. Do it right. But can I give you one small suggestion? ",
        "Dinah: Please do. ",
        "Harley: In the next few months or years,\r\nwhatever, it's not going to be the details that you remember. It's going to be\r\nthe way that you felt when you stood there and looked into the eyes of this man\r\nthat you love and said, \"I do\"... in front of all of your friends and\r\nfamily! ( Laughs ) ",

        "Harley: Yeah! So don't sweat the details.\r\nAnd if you have to make a few compromises to make Mallet happy, who cares? \r\n",
        "Dinah: So are you saying that I shouldn't\r\nexpress how I feel or what I really want? You know, just don't say anything,\r\nkeep it to myself so I don't stir things up? ",
        "Harley: It's working for me. ",
        "Dinah: Well, I don't know if that works for\r\nme. You know, I mean... if that's what marriage is about, I don't know. I mean,\r\njust forget it. The wedding's off. ",
        "",
        "Gus: Double shot, right, Frank? Here you go.\r\nSo here's the deal. Ever since we got back together, she's been freaking me\r\nout. Freaking me out. She's so mellow, Frank, I can\u2019t... I want to strangle\r\nher. ",
        "Frank: Whoa, wait, wait. My sister? Mellow? ",
        "Gus: Yes. I've been testing her. Okay, we\r\nput in a toilet bowl, I did that. And it works, right? I've been leaving the\r\nseat up, Frank. Leaving the seat up! I've also been putting orange juice\r\ncontainers empty and milk containers empty back in the refrigerator. You know\r\nwhat she says to me? \"Somebody's been thirsty! I'll run to the store for\r\nmy man!\" ",
        "Frank: Did she do this thing where she,\r\nlike, clears her throat really loudly, and then... ",
        "Gus: Punches me? ",
        "Frank: Yeah, punches you in the arm. ",
        "Gus: No, Frank, she has not been doing that.\r\nAnd here's the kicker, right? We've been going over stuff for the house?\r\nEverything that I say, she agrees with it. Come on, Frank! You know that my\r\ntaste sucks. ",
        "Frank: You know what, hold on a second. What\r\nhappens if my sister just happens to be happy? You know, maybe the little\r\nthings aren't bothering her anymore right now. Why do you just sit back and\r\nenjoy the ride? ",
        "Mallet: Oh, guys, hey. This is perfect. I'm\r\nglad I ran into you. ",

        "Mallet: All right, I'll pick the music. But\r\nI also get to pick my best man, right? So, speaking of which, I do have a man\r\nfor the job. We don't always see eye to eye. There's been some bad blood\r\nbetween us, but I do consider him a friend, and so, I would be honored... ",
