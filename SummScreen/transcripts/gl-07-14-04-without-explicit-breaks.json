        "Danny: Okay, michelle, you can show up anytime now.",
        "Tony: You can see the whole town from up there, michelle. You can see everything.",
        "(Phone rings)",
        "Michelle: Oh, shoot. Danny, I am so sorry. Are you at the beach already?",
        "Danny: Yeah. But, hey, no worries. I just got here. I was just checking in, you know, to see when I should expect you.",
        "Michelle: I'm on my way. I'll be back.",
        "Shayne: Is it on? It's on? Okay. Alan, glad you could join us. We are having a little debate here.",
        "Marina: Yes, we're trying to come up with a mature informed executive decision.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, it's more like an executive decision on whether or not to blow you off. All against? All in favor?",
        "All: Aye!",
        "Lizzie: We're in enough trouble with my grandfather as it is.",
        "Joey: Whoa, who's we? Sandy and marina are the ones who are in jail.",
        "Marina: We'll come up with a program alan needs, okay? We just need some time.",
        "Remy: That's fine. But... but the rest of us need to be coming with some lame ideas so spaulding could make a pile of money and cut us out of the profit. So let's just get it over with.",
        "Shayne: No, man. Look the sun is shining. Okay, the sky is blue. There's so much we could do.",
        "Joey: All right, so, come on, what are we going to do? Work or beach? Work or beach? Work or beach? Huh? Lizzie? Let's see what our contestants have to say. Who's it going to be now? Tammy, why don't you tell us.",
        "Tammy: Well, we could do both. We could work at the beach.",
        "Sandy: Teenagers do hang out at the beach, wouldn't agree, mr. Spaulding? I think miss winslow has come up with a terrific solution.",
        "Remy: I don't think I could work around all those bikinis.",
        "Shayne: Yeah.",
        "Remy: But I'm willing to try.",
        "Shayne: Me too. So all those in favor of doing the spaulding project at the beach...",
        "Lizzie: Joey, turn it off, please. Joey?! Turn it off. Turn it off.",
        "Bill: I'm saying you're the one with the union connection. Why are we getting shakedowns?",
        "Tony: Relax. I'm going to handle it. I'm telling you, but please you can not be the guy going around yelling at guys in hard hats all day, all right.",
        "Bill: Well, if you're going to handle it then handle. Don't just say you're going to do an not do it. Because it needs to be done, you know what I mean?",
        "Tony: I said, I'm going to handle it. You as a partner, you're like a nagging wife all the time.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, you're like that little kid, I've got to constantly clean up after. That's you know...",
        "Tony: We make the perfect team.",
        "Bill: The best.",
        "Tony: That's we wanted, right?",
        "Bill: Never thought I'd be having so much fun.",
        "Tony: Yeah, I'll see you.",
        "Bill: All right.",
        "Tony: All right.",
        "Olivia: Bill? So this is the part where you say that you haven't been avoiding me and that you're sorry you haven't returned my calls.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, the thing about that is, I'm not sorry.",
        "Phillip: Hey, josh. Join me. Let me buy you a drink.",
        "Josh: Uh... (laughs) no, thank you. I appreciate it.",
        "Phillip: Oh, no, come on. Come on. Have a seat.",
        "Josh: Okay, great. This is some kind of a celebration? Or...",
        "Phillip: No, it's the medication. (Laughs) I'm kidding.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Phillip: I'm kidding. I'm kidding. No, but I am in a good mood these days.",
        "Josh: Marriage must agree with you.",
        "Phillip: Well, you were married to olivia. I don't have to tell you.",
        "Josh: If you could make that work, you're better man than I.",
        "Phillip: (Laughs) well... yeah, making it work. That's what it's about, isn't it? Keeping it interesting. Keeping your better half guessing.",
        "Josh: That's not exactly what I meant, but...",
        "Phillip: But you do. You always have to have a little surprise up your sleeve for a rainy day. And actually, you know, it's very funny, because for olivia today is just such a day.",
        "Olivia: I thought that we were ready to become valuable to each other. Now you're avoiding me.",
        "Bill: Well, you know things change.",
        "Olivia: Not for no reason.",
        "Bill: Look, olivia, I don't want to get into it. Right now, whatever happened is in the past. Whatever we thought was going to happen is a fantasy.",
        "Olivia: Or missed opportunity. Who wants to live with that?",
        "Bill: Well, I'm willing to take that chance.",
        "Olivia: Is this about your new best friend, tony santos?",
        "Bill: (Laughing)",
        "Olivia: Am I stepping on toes?",
        "Bill: No.",
        "Olivia: Because it doesn't have to be that way. What we have doesn't have to conflict with what you have going on with him, okay. This is just about you and me. And I guarantee you the perks working with me are going to be far more stimulating.",
        "Bill: That part of our deal was a little tempting.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, for both of us. And we barely scratched the surface.",
        "Bill: Sometimes, you know, you've got to cut your losses.",
        "Olivia: What losses? We're talking about making serious deals.",
        "Bill: Well, maybe it's time you get serious with your husband instead.",
        "Olivia: We're nothing to each other, okay?",
        "Bill: Mm-hmm.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, it's complicated. But we're...",
        "Bill: Unhappily married. Olivia, for better, for worse. Look I'm sorry you're in the worst end of things, but I'm not getting in the middle.",
        "Josh: You know, I'm almost afraid to ask this question, but what is the surprise you have in store for olivia?",
        "Phillip: I was just thinking out loud. Hey, how's bill holding on? He's been doing some interesting things lately.",
        "Josh: Yes, he has.",
        "Phillip: Well, I guess personal tragedy could be a great motivator.",
        "Josh: That's a cynical way of looking at it. But...",
        "Phillip: Well, all I'm saying is lewis construction's been going great guns lately. Sort of stepped in and filled that void that was left when spaulding was involved with other things.",
        "Josh: You know, phillip, i think there's plenty room in this town for everybody. I do.",
        "Phillip: You think?",
        "Josh: Yeah. Thanks for the drink. And take care.",
        "Phillip: You too.",
        "Josh: Thanks. It's not going to work.",
        "Tony: Well, josh, it looks pretty good to me. I mean, you have been doing this longer than me. So tell me what you're thinking.",
        "Josh: That's not what I'm talking about, tony. This partnership thing you've got going on with bill, I'm not going to let it happen.",
        "Tony: I think we'll take our chances.",
        "Josh: You know, maybe I'm not making myself clear. Either you dissolve this partnership with my nephew or i will.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, joey, I said turn it off!",
        "Tammy: I have an announcement to make. I don't care if we go to the beach or no work, but I'm wearing a bikini.",
        "Shayne: Yeah.",
        "Lizzie: So, joey, what about you? When are you going to unleash that body, huh?",
        "Joey: Unleash?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, come on, you work out all the time. Shouldn't someone enjoy the results? Come on. No. Give me it back.",
        "Joey: I'm going to get a drink.",
        "Sandy: Could she be more obvious?",
        "Tammy: I don't know what you're talking about. Lizzie promised me she wasn't after joey.",
        "Marina: What's up? You seem bummed.",
        "Shayne: Well, that's because this whole thing seems like a big waste of time. I mean, come on, who really needs this scholarship, huh?",
        "Marina: I did. Joey does.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, yeah, well, now that you're out the competition, sandy's out of it. I mean really, what's the point? Why are we even here?",
        "Marina: Try working at company for the rest of the summer.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, I get that. Just this all seems really meaningless.",
        "Joey: Okay, fine. So what'd we decide, guys? Work or beach?",
        "Remy: Well, as senior member of this committee, let's go.",
        "Lizzie: Hey, can I ride with you?",
        ">Joey: Sure.",
        "Remy: Ready?",
        "Tammy: My heroes. (Laughter)",
        "Michelle: Hey, I'm here.",
        "Danny: Hey.",
        "Michelle: Finally. Wow. You expecting some company or what?",
        "Danny: Well, just you.",
        "Michelle: Hmm.",
        "Danny: Yeah, you know, i thought it might be a nice way to hang out at the lake. So where were you?",
        "Michelle: You're never going to believe it.",
        "Danny: Try me.",
        "Michelle: A guy went into cardiac arrest right in front of me. And I had this total major medical recall moment.",
        "Danny: What? You remembered your training?",
        "Michelle: I didn't remember anything. I just knew what to do when i saved the guys life. And how's that for a good excuse for being late, huh?",
        "Danny: Okay. Well, it's about the best possible one you could have come up with. What... what happened? Tell me about it.",
        "Michelle: There's nothing much to tell. Big guy, heart attack. Chest compressions and he came back.",
        "Danny: Just like that?",
        "Michelle: Yeah. So you brought me out here to relax. So let's relax.",
        "Danny: Do you want some wine?",
        "Michelle: Sure.",
        "Danny: Okay. Here you go.",
        "Michelle: Cut it out.",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Michelle: You're staring at me.",
        "Danny: No... sorry. Old habit I guess. It's getting pretty crowded out here.",
        "Michelle: It's a really, really nice day to be out with someone.",
        "Danny: Yeah. Bad day for them.",
        "Michelle: And how can you tell?",
        "Danny: Oh, well, look at her body language. She furious with him.",
        "Michelle: You don't know that.",
        "Danny: Yeah, I do.",
        "Michelle: What do you see that I don't?",
        "Danny: Well, obviously it all started when he forget to take out the trash last night.",
        "Michelle: Oh, the trash.",
        "Danny: Yeah. And she told him the dog was going to get into it and of course they woke up this morning when rex, their st. Bernard jumped onto the bed covered in coffee grounds and chicken guts.",
        "Michelle: Oh.",
        "Danny: Yeah, and you know what they've been doing when rex jumped all over the bed.",
        "Michelle: Watching cartoons? Okay, what about them over there?",
        "Danny: Young love. First love.",
        "Michelle: I give it two weeks.",
        "Danny: That's harsh.",
        "Michelle: I'm just being honest. You disagree?",
        "Danny: No, but I choose to be hopeful.",
        "Michelle: And I like that about you. And I like this game.",
        "Danny: Well, actually I stole a movie that we saw together, but I figured you wouldn't remember, so...",
        "Michelle: See, you got me. That is the first time, you know, that you've actually made a joke about my condition. I think you're making progress.",
        "Danny: Well, all right, I was going to save this for a later time, but ah... I got you a little something something.",
        "Michelle: It's beautiful.",
        "Danny: Well, I'm glad you like it.",
        "Michelle: Danny?",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Michelle: You trying to buy me?",
        "Danny: Yeah, michelle, I'm trying to buy you. What kind of question is that? Of course I'm not trying to buy you.",
        "Michelle: Good. Good. Because as far as I know, I'm not for sale. At least I don't think so, danny. You tell me.",
        "Danny: What? No. Although you've always been a sucker for nice things.",
        "Michelle: Or maybe you've been a sucker for buying me nice things.",
        "Danny: That too. You want to try it on? Let's see how it looks.",
        "Michelle: So what is the occasion?",
        "Danny: No occasion. Just me being the amazing husband I am. And I was thinking-- as far as you're concerned, I've never given you anything. I wanted to change that.",
        "Michelle: Thanks.",
        "Danny: You're welcome.",
        "Michelle: Hey, look what the tide dragged in.",
        "Danny: Oh, so much for being alone.",
        "Michelle: Oh, come on. Don't you remember what it was like being young, out of school for the summer, having fun with your friends?",
        "Danny: Yeah, I do.",
        "Michelle: Well, I don't, but it looks like fun. Hey, guys.",
        "Danny: Hey.",
        "Shayne: Hey, michelle. What's up?",
        "Marina: How are you feeling?",
        "Michelle: Got a new necklace.",
        "Tammy: Oh, that's beautiful.",
        "Joey: Nice, dude.",
        "Danny: Thanks, dude.",
        "Michelle: What are you guys doing, doing a movie or something?",
        "Tammy: Oh, we're doing a project for the spaulding internship competition.",
        "Sandy: Yeah, a summer blockbuster, full of romance, action, corporate intrigue, maybe even an explosion or too. Oh, sorry, michelle. Didn't mean to...",
        "Michelle: Don't worry about it. So I got caught in an explosion that nearly killed me and almost changed my life forever. It's not your problem, right? You guys can have a good time. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I don't remember the explosion. Give me a camera. I'll take a picture. All right, do something... i don't know. Do something, like, teenagery. Say something to your boss.",
        "Joey: All right, alan, quit being a player hater, man, and let us use your house for the after party tonight.",
        "Lizzie: See, there's this big dance, and we all don't know what to do afterward.",
        "Sandy: Lizzie hit gramps up for the use of the spaulding mansion, but he didn't go for that.",
        "Danny: You're kidding. You guys running wild all over the spaulding grounds, and alan said no? Well, I don't know.",
        "Michelle: Come to our house. Come to our house.",
        "Joey: Are you serious?",
        "Michelle: Yeah! We've got plenty of room. Just bring your own music.",
        "Joey: Giddy-up!",
        "Sandy: Shayne, come on. Let's go in.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, hey, joey, by the way, I got some new cds. Maybe you can come over and check them out. All right, let's go. Come on.",
        "Tammy: What's up with joey?",
        "Sandy: You tell me.",
        "Tammy: I mean, he points his camera right at me, makes me the star of his movie...",
        "Sandy: And now he looks like he wants a new costar.",
        "Tammy: You know, I don't think joey knows what he wants. But I do.",
        "Michelle: So are you okay with this?",
        "Danny: Hmm? What, the party? Yeah, sure. Why not?",
        "Michelle: Good. Good attitude. All right, let's go.",
        "Danny: Okay. I'm right behind you.",
        "Josh: I don't want to preach to you, tony.",
        "Tony: Well, I'm sure you will anyway. Am I right?",
        "Josh: The choices you make may have consequences for me and for my family. Now, you can do whatever you want with your life. I really don't care. But I'm not going to let you infect my family.",
        "Tony: Bill's a big boy, josh. If he wants to do business with me, it's his prerogative. He can do what he wants to do.",
        "Josh: Yeah, well, see, the deal is this. He needs a green light from me on any project he brings to lewis construction. He's not going to get that if you're involved.",
        "Tony: Oh, I see. So you're going to undercut him then, right?",
        "Josh: If that's what I have to do, yes. But I'd rather not. I'd rather make it easier. I'd rather you just dissolve this partnership between the two of you.",
        "Tony: Let me tell you something, josh. I suggest that you don't interfere with my business, me, or anyone else. You understand that?",
        "Josh: Really?",
        "Tony: Yeah, really. You should be asking yourself, \"josh, how far will tony be willing to go, and can I take the heat once he does?\"",
        "Olivia: Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. So you're just... you're cutting me loose.",
        "Bill: Well, you catch on quick.",
        "Olivia: What did phillip say to you?",
        "Bill: Phillip?",
        "Olivia: He got to you. What did he say to you?",
        "Bill: Well, that you're the love of his life, that you're love will stand the test of time, all that.",
        "Olivia: You bought that?",
        "Bill: Well, it doesn't really matter, does it, olivia? Look, when you first came to me, there was no strings attached, and it worked. But now it's like you've got some big, heavy rope attached.",
        "Olivia: Look, whatever he said to you, it's a lie. He knows that we can hurt him. Why else do you think he's talking to you?",
        "Bill: Look, olivia, this isn't about you. This isn't about phillip. It's about me getting a wake-up call.",
        "Olivia: This is about you getting manipulated by phillip.",
        "Bill: Oh, you mean and not by you?",
        "Olivia: Fine. Was I playing you in the beginning? Yeah, I was. But I think it's pretty clear what we want from each other. Come on. I came to you and I offered you power and control, and you wanted it as much as I did. You wanted to do it all.",
        "Bill: It's too bad you're married. You're cornered, you're scared, you're lost.",
        "Olivia: Come on, bill. Come on.",
        "Bill: Olivia, I'm doing my own thing in this town, okay? I'm not going to get involved with you, because there's just too many complications. Go home to phillip, your husband, the father of your child.",
        "Olivia: You're going to regret this.",
        "Bill: Maybe I will, but i doubt it. Coming up on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Tammy: I think joey likes hurting me.",
        "Sandy: Maybe that's enough. This was your idea. I'm just getting started.",
        "Olivia: Stupid voice mail. Phillip, hi. It's me. Bill lewis got your message loud and clear, and so did I. You want to get back together, you want to rekindle those hot days of groping each other in the elevator, of exchanging subtle vows of love while you were in the loony bin? Fine. We can brush each other's teeth, we can knock them out. Whatever you want. I'll see you at home, darling. I hope you rot.",
        "Phillip: Beautiful day, huh?",
        "Bill: Enjoying that apple, are you?",
        "Phillip: Mmm. You ever go apple picking, bill?",
        "Bill: Yeah. Yeah, I guess.",
        "Phillip: We have an orchard upstate, and apple trees as far as the eye can see. I used to go there a lot when i was a kid.",
        "Bill: Good. Good for you.",
        "Phillip: I remember we had this old guy used to work up there for us, and he used to tell me that the secret to picking anything was always timing. He used to always say you never want to pick an apple or anything else too soon. You want to let it flourish and grow on the tree for as long as possible, and then, only when the time was right, when it was perfectly right, that's when you want to pluck it.",
        "Bill: I'll keep that in mind.",
        "Phillip: You do that. It might come in handy one of these days. Well, enjoy this beautiful day, bill.",
        "Lizzie: Michelle is so cool now. I mean, not that she wasn't cool before or anything, but she never would have let us have this party at her house.",
        "Shayne: So did you see danny's face?",
        "Marina: Bigger stride, too much arm.",
        "Shayne: So I have my pitching coach back now, huh?",
        "Marina: Well, I got you to the bigs before. I think I can do it again.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, well, my arm is nowhere near major league right now, nowhere.",
        "Marina: Well, we'll get you there.",
        "Shayne: Project shayne lewis, take two.",
        "Marina: I will be there for every single throw. You want your career back, don't you?",
        "Shayne: I'm just happy to be throwing again.",
        "Marina: Oh, for now. But come on. I mean, you had big dreams, big goals. You were so close, shayne. Wouldn't it be incredible if you got that close again, but this time you made it? Oh, you think you're a hot shot there, don't you, lewis?",
        "Bill: No, no, no, no, no. I know I'm a hot shot.",
        "Sandy: Let me guess-- if you stare at him long enough he'll start to love you again.",
        "Tammy: Sandy...",
        "Sandy: Let me tear you away form your futile dream for a minute. Come on.",
        "Tammy: I'm not in the mood for another lecture or any more good advice.",
        "Sandy: Are you in the mood for staying sad all the time?",
        "Tammy: Well, I don't really look at it like that.",
        "Sandy: Well, look. Are you going to go there and tell him right now that you want him, and jump him?",
        "Tammy: Why, so he can just reject me again? No. No, thanks.",
        "Sandy: So you know what we need?",
        "Tammy: I'm sure you're going to tell me.",
        "Sandy: You need release therapy. I saw it on dr. Phil.",
        "Tammy: Well, if it's anything like a magic spell that will make you stop caring, count me in. What do I do?",
        "Sandy: You trash him.",
        "Tammy: Joey?",
        "Sandy: Mm-hmm. You tell me everything about him that bothers you. Let go of the anger and tell me down to the most minute detail what you hate about joey.",
        "Tammy: And I'll feel better?",
        "Sandy: Trust me, you won't feel worse. (Cell phone rings)",
        "Danny: I'm sorry, I've got to take this. Why don't you go grab a drink and I'll be in in a minute, okay?",
        "Michelle: All right. I'll order you something manly, but with an umbrella.",
        "Danny: Right.",
        "Josh: You know, I'm not trying to get into anybody's way here, tony. I'm just telling you not to get in mine.",
        "Tony: Josh, I respect you. I do. I always have. When I was with marah, even when I wasn'T. That doesn't matter, but my business is my business. Nobody tells me how to run my business, nobody tells me otherwise, you understand that? I have every right to turn a profit in this town as anyone else does.",
        "Josh: That's true. That's fine. It's just not going to be with my nephew.",
        "Tony: You know, every time i hear a threat, it makes me want to threaten people back.",
        "Josh: Gosh, do I look scared to you right now?",
        "Tony: I don't think so. But I'm not the person that you want to threaten, josh. I always follow through.",
        "Shayne: So basically last year, you know, everything was great. I had marina. I had baseball. That's what I wanted.",
        "Bill: Well, sounds good to me, man.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, yeah. And then everything got messed up. Everything got weird. The whole mess with ben. Then he went away and it...",
        "Bill: Right, right.",
        "Shayne: No, no, I didn'T... that came out wrong. I know he was a friend, i meant...",
        "Bill: No, no. Hey, hey, hey, listen to me. Don't apologize. I'll tell you the truth: I didn't even know who ben was by the end of all that. In fact, I hated what he did to marina. He made her grow up before she had to, and that sucks.",
        "Shayne: Yeah. Yeah. And then there was the accident, you know? I mean, she was with me 24-7.",
        "Bill: You guys had a tough year. But things have calmed down now, right?",
        "Shayne: I have this feeling that she wants to get back all the fun that we missed, you know what I mean? And that's what my parents want, too.",
        "Bill: Your parents? What, are they giving you advice lately?",
        "Shayne: No, no. But I know that's what they want.",
        "Bill: Come on, man. Never mind what they want. What do you want?",
        "Shayne: I just want everybody to be happy.",
        "Bill: Are those violins? That's a beautiful sound. I mean, come on. Come here, man. I've watched you grow up, man, and you've gone out of your way not to make waves. Maybe it's because everyone around you made them for you, but this is your shot. It's your turn. Go for it. If it's baseball, do it. If you want to come work for the company, do that, man. If you want to go work for springfield zoo, I've got your back. But you've got to make your own choices, here.",
        "Shayne: Yeah?",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Shayne: I guess.",
        "Bill: That's right. Come on, we come from a great family of well-meaning people who are more than willing to share their opinion and that's a good thing. Sometimes all it does is clutter your head. I mean, remember when I had to take off and get my life straight?",
        "Shayne: Yeah.",
        "Bill: Right?",
        "Shayne: And you came back.",
        "Bill: That's right, I came back. I came back and I thought I had all the answers. But what happens? You fall back in the old trap of letting everyone make the decisions for you. Shayne, man, you've got to learn from my mistakes, right? Stand up for yourself. You've got to do what you've got to do. You've got to go wherever you've got to go, and I'm telling you, your family, marina, they're going to respect you for it. They are. And if they don't, well, that's their loss.",
        "Shayne: Yeah. I got it. Thanks.",
        "Bill: All right, man. All right.",
        "Marina: Hey, what's going on here? You guys look serious.",
        "Bill: Never. What are you talking about? You got too much sun today, that's what you got. So, I'm out of here.",
        "Tammy: So, why is this a good idea? I mean, we both know that I like joey, so what's the point in trashing him?",
        "Sandy: Well, you have the guy on a pedestal because you can't have him, and that's never going to change until you get some perspective and move on with your life. So, trashing joey. Take one, action.",
        "Tammy: I don't know. He's really obsessed with sports.",
        "Sandy: Cut. Cut. Cut. You've got to be brutal. Brutal. Action.",
        "Tammy: Okay, joey can be a doofus sometimes and he doesn't even know it.",
        "Sandy: Ah. He's clueless. Good start.",
        "Tammy: And eating pasta with the guy, you practically have to wear a raincoat. This is bad. This is...",
        "Sandy: No, no. This is good. Keep going, keep going.",
        "Tammy: I mean, he slurps it and gets sauce all over the place, and then he takes his bread and your bread and mops the whole plate up with it, and then he swallows it all down like a vacuum cleaner. I shouldn't be having fun with this.",
        "Sandy: But you are. So roll with it.",
        "Tammy: You should see how many products he buys. I mean, he's got, like, ten different colognes and they all smell like tree bark, anyway. And his hair? You run your fingers through it and it starts making you look for excuses to go wash your hands. Joey thinks he's so cool, but deep down you can tell that he's just a scared little boy. Not the highest iq in the world, either.",
        "Sandy: Hm. Must be all the hairroducts.",
        "Tammy: And he knows how to hurt you. It's a special talent he has. And the worst part of it is-- and I know this is going to sound cold-- but sometimes i think joey likes hurting me. At least he doesn't mind.",
        "Sandy: Maybe that's enough.",
        "Tammy: No, no, no, no. This was your idea. I'm just getting started.",
        "Josh: Don't try to pull that santos mob nonsense on me, tony. I'm not some street punk that you people have on your payroll.",
        "Tony: Whoa, whoa, whoa. \"You people\"?",
        "Josh: Bill thought danny had changed and we all know how that turned out.",
        "Tony: Danny's the one that brought the mob down in the first place, josh.",
        "Josh: Yeah, after he went back and forth on it for quite a while. Now, hopefully he's got his act together, but you, tony? In this area, I don't think you're ever going to change.",
        "Tony: Good day, josh.",
        "Josh: Michelle. Tony and I, we have a history.",
        "Michelle: Don't worry about it. Really.",
        "Josh: I just want you to know those things I was just saying about the santos family, i wasn't talking about danny, really. Danny is different.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, I know. You don't have to tell me. It's fine.",
        "Josh: Okay. Have a good day.",
        "Danny: Josh, hey. How are you doing? You okay?",
        "Josh: Yeah, I'm fine, thank you. Michelle is inside. Listen, how's it going for the two of you?",
        "Danny: You know, finding our way.",
        "Josh: That's good. I'm sure it must be difficult. I've been wanting to talk to you, though. Business. Do you have a minute?",
        "Danny: Uh, well, yeah. Sure.",
        "Josh: Come with me for a minute.",
        "Danny: Yeah, what did you have in mind?",
        "Michelle: So I guess josh is glad you're not dating his daughter anymore.",
        "Tony: Yeah.",
        "Olivia: No. No, you can't close my brokerage account. I have all my holdings with your firm. It was mr. Spaulding's suggestion? How can my account be a conflict of interest with spaulding when I am a spaulding? Fine. Fine. Just transfer my funds to my bank. Idiot. Hi, check-in is that way, okay? (Screams)",
        "Josh: Now, I do have a confession to make to you. Cassie told me that the construction loans on the fifth street project are coming due.",
        "Danny: Okay. And I told cassie it's not a problem.",
        "Josh: I'm sure it's not, but my guess is you could use a little cash flow. Now, we're both businessmen, we're both looking for the next good deal. Fifth street was a good thing for both of us. Why don't we start working together on something again? You know, something new, something fresh.",
        "Danny: Josh, I'm not looking for a pity deal.",
        "Josh: This is not a pity deal. It's not. That's not what it's about. Your public reputation took a nice good positive bump when you got rid of vinnie salerno, right? And maybe some of that will rub off on lewis construction.",
        "Danny: Wait a second. Sie when do you need my help? Come on.",
        "Josh: Danny, I'm not in the business of giving handouts. You would be a good partner, i already know that. And this is a way that I can help, I suppose. Your focus right now is on michelle, primarily, and that's exactly where it should be. But this is a way that I can help.",
        "Danny: All right, okay. I'll think about it.",
        "Josh: Okay, that's fine. Fair enough. I've got an appointment to get to. I'll see you.",
        "Danny: Actually, josh, before you go, I have actually been meaning to call you, because i wanted to ask you about... about reva.",
        "Josh: Yeah, reva went through a very similar thing that michelle is going through. Loss of memory, trying to rebuild her life.",
        "Danny: Right, so how did you two get through that?",
        "Josh: There's no simple answer to that question. There's no single way to do that.",
        "Danny: Okay. Do you mind me asking how you did it? If it's not a good time...",
        "Josh: No, I'm willing to talk to you about it. It just can't be right now, but let me just say this. There's no simple, single way to get back to normal. Sometimes, though, you have to change your definition of what normal is.",
        "Danny: What does that mean?",
        "Josh: In reva's case, she went far away from us, far away from her home and her family, before she found her way back to us. I'll see you. All right?",
        "Danny: Okay. Thanks.",
        "Michelle: So, are you and josh going to be okay? That was pretty heated.",
        "Tony: It was just business.",
        "Michelle: It seemed pretty personal to me.",
        "Tony: It was something like that, but he'll see my way eventually.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, I don't doubt that. So, party at my place tonight. Want to come?",
        "Tony: (Laughs)",
        "Shayne: Thanks, bill. I owe you.",
        "Bill: Hey, listen to me. If I can help you avoid one of the mistakes that I did, then it's worth it. All right? Just don't over-think it. You're going to work it out.",
        "Shayne: Just like you did, yeah.",
        "Bill: Just like I did-- well, the jury is still out on that one, all right? I've got to go. Take care. See you all later!",
        "Joey: All right, last one was breaking pretty good.",
        "Shayne: No. My motion is all off.",
        "Marina: Don't be so hard on yourself. Enjoy it.",
        "Shayne: I will.",
        "Joey: Do you know how lucky you are, man?",
        "Shayne: Yeah, to be walking and throwing again? Mm-hmm.",
        "Joey: No, I'm talking about marina.",
        "Shayne: I know. It's all I think about.",
        "Joey: She doesn't try to change you or compare you to anyone else. She wants the whole baseball thing for you, you know? That's big.",
        "Shayne: More than I do, sometimes.",
        "Joey: Come on, what's that supposed to mean?",
        "Shayne: Nothing.",
        "Tammy: Thanks for the therapy. I think it really helped.",
        "Sandy: Good. Then promise me this: You won't feel sorry for yourself anymore, because really, it's joey's loss.",
        "Tammy: Yeah? Well, sometimes I just wish he would see it that way, you know?",
        "Sandy: And since he doesn't, what does that tell you?",
        "Tammy: I know, I know. But joey's the only guy I ever really, you know...",
        "Sandy: Perk up, buttercup. There will be other guys.",
        "Tammy: Well, I just hope I do better with them.",
        "Sandy: Maybe they'll be better guys.",
        "Tammy: You're sweet. Thank you. Joey can be a doofus sometimes and he doesn't even know it.",
        "Sandy: He's clueless. Good start.",
        "Lizzie: (Laughs)",
        "Tammy: And eating pasta with the guy, you practically need a raincoat. This is bad.",
        "Sandy: No, it's good. Keep going.",
        "Lizzie: Tammy, tammy. You are so mean.",
        "Joey: Lizzie!",
        "Lizzie: Oh. I'm coming.",
        "Olivia: Hey! Hey!",
        "Phillip: It's locked.",
        "Olivia: Phillip.",
        "Phillip: Olivia. I'm so glad you could make it. I know how much you love limos, so I thought this would be the perfect place.",
        "Olivia: What, are you crazy? You're kidnapping me?",
        "Phillip: Well, I've always been a sucker for drama. That's probably what drew me to you in the first place.",
        "Olivia: Where are we going?",
        "Phillip: For a little ride. We need to talk, now that circumstances have changed.",
        "Olivia: Changed?",
        "Phillip: Well, I'm sure by now you've seen your brokerage account-- or what remains of your brokerage account. And now that bill has tossed you and whatever plans you had to the curb, I think you're finally at the end of your road, all alone, with nowhere to turn. Except to me.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Harley: If you still want to put that ring on my finger after tonight.",
        "Gus: Why would you say something like that?",
        "Harley: Because I did something.",
        "Phillip: But first we have a little business deal to negotiate. We have to discuss terms.",
        "Olivia: Terms?",
        "Phillip: Of your surrender."
