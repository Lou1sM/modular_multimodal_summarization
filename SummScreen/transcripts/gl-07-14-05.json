        "Cassie: Lizzie? What are you doing out here?",
        "Lizzie: You're Tammy's mom, not mine. Why can't you just go worry about her? I can't go home, okay, because my mom will ask questions and if I go to Company, then Coop will find me there. And I know we have this suite here, so just please don't ask me any questions. Its just problems with family and boyfriends.",
        "Cassie: Hey. Come here. Oh, hello, puppy. Hello. Boy, must be nice to be you, huh? Have someone take care of you all the time. Boyfriend and family, huh? You know what? I think that maybe we have something in common.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Absolutely not. There is no way I'm going to do this, even for love. Especially for somebody else's love.",
        "Edmund: Put that back on, Dinah. I'm warning you.",
        "Dinah: Okay, how about \"please, Dinah.\"",
        "Edmund: Please, Dinah. Pretty please, Dinah, with Pringles on top.",
        "Dinah: No. If you love this thing so much, why don't you put it on? I'm not going to run around with a pillow on my tummy just waiting for you to worm your way back into Cassie's life.",
        "Edmund: Listen to me, Dinah. That isn't the reason I want you to go on pretending you're pregnant. My plans have changed.",
        "Dinah: Oh?",
        "Edmund: Absolutely. For the last several months, Cassie has taken everything I have away from me and right now all I want to do is take everything away from her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: So Reva knows who I am. I should have guessed it was too easy when she just handed me the passwords, begged me to hack my way into the Lewis accounts. ( Disgusted sigh ) Transferring thousands of dollars whilst leaving a trail right to myself. ( Laughs ) She is such a very naughty girl, this one.",
        "Jonathan: Forget about Reva and just get out while you still can.",
        "Nate: No, not quite yet. Do unto others, that's my philosophy. All right, kiddo. Thank you for the tip-off.",
        "Jonathan: Wait, don't... Reva.",
        "Reva: Come on, Olivia. Pick up the phone. Nate is in there right now moving the money out of Lewis, and I don't know how much longer I can put up with this act. ( Cell phone ringing ) ( Pounding on door )",
        "Olivia: Alan, you miserable... let me... let me out of here! Reva! ( Screaming ) ( Man groaning )",
        "Olivia: Who's there?",
        "Sebastian: ( Groans )",
        "Olivia: Oh, my God. Sebastian.",
        "Reva: Voice mail. Olivia, I don't know why you're not picking up the phone, but come on. The plan is ready for round one. For Jonathan's sake, for Marissa's sake, for the sake of my marriage, you have got to get over here. We've got to make Nate look like he's guilty. I need you to show up here and punch me in the nose.",
        "Jonathan: So, is that job still open or can anyone apply?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: You expect me to believe that you're going to give up on Cassie?",
        "Edmund: I'm not just giving up, Dinah. I'm going to punish her. Now, put the pad back on and I'll explain, all right?",
        "Dinah: Why don't you put it on me and then I might listen.",
        "Edmund: Fine, fine. Lift up your shirt. Come on.",
        "Dinah: Okay. Pull it snug. Okay? Ooh, that's good. All right. Yeah. I like it tight.",
        "Coop: Hey! You guys, hi. Um, have you guys seen Lizzie anywhere?",
        "Dinah: No. No",
        "Coop: Is she inside, do you know?",
        "Dinah: Sorry.",
        "Coop: Okay. Thanks, anyways.",
        "Edmund: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Well, whatever it is, it must be bad or you'd never be sitting on the floor in that outfit.",
        "Lizzie: I... I can't trust anyone, not even the one person that I thought I could trust.",
        "Cassie: The boyfriend? Coop? I'm friends with Blake.",
        "Lizzie: Well, yeah, Coop and I were together until, um, I caught him talking to my mom behind my back. It was like they were teaming up against me.",
        "Cassie: Well, Coop's a really nice guy. I'm sure he had a reason to call your mom.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, but my mom is making him think I'm a freak. It's like my whole family is ruining everything. I know if it was just us, me and Coop, away from everybody else, no family...",
        "Cassie: No baggage.",
        "Lizzie: Exactly. I know we'd be okay if everybody would just leave us alone.",
        "Cassie: I know what you mean, but the world doesn't work that way.",
        "Lizzie: No kidding.",
        "Cassie: No kidding. You know, when you're starting out new with a guy, it's never easy.",
        "Lizzie: Ever?",
        "Cassie: There's a long list of things that get in the way. Your past.",
        "Lizzie: Kids. I mean, I'm sure kids have to get in the way, right? I'm sure my mom blames a lot of that on me.",
        "Cassie: Blames you?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, for why she's alone. It's like she's always worried about me and that gets in the way.",
        "Cassie: Well, yeah, I guess kids do complicate things, but don't you think they should? I mean, they're supposed to come first and I know your mom feels that way.",
        "Lizzie: You really think so?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I think so. No matter what's going on in your mom's life, she's always going to put you first, she's always going to choose you. Just like I'll always choose my kids.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: All right, tell me one more time why I'm supposed to believe that you and Cassie are actually going to be finito.",
        "Edmund: Every man has his breaking point, Dinah. Mine's just been a long time in coming. I poured everything I had into my marriage with Cassie; it just wasn't enough. I gave her my life. I laid it at her feet.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, just so she could tap dance on you.",
        "Edmund: Nothing I gave her was good enough, nothing I could ever give her would be good enough, because the only thing she really wanted was to jump into bed with the face of my dead brother. Everything we shared together just-- pfft-- forgotten about. When Cassie discovers the loss of the baby you're carrying, it is going to destroy every shred of connection between the two of us.",
        "Dinah: And what about when the baby's due?",
        "Edmund: We sit back and watch. When she knows the baby's gone, that it's been gone the whole time, she's going to be crushed. Just imagine, Dinah, your very heart's desire, sitting right at your fingertips and then you find out it's gone. It's gone as if it was just never there to begin with.",
        "Dinah: Oh, my gosh. Are you done?",
        "Edmund: No, I'm not, Dinah, because I'm not playing by Cassie's rules anymore. This is my game. Our game.",
        "Dinah: Oh. Together?",
        "Edmund: Without you, there is no game. I need you, Dinah. I need you desperately.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Wake up, idiot!",
        "Sebastian: Hey, ow. What is your problem?",
        "Olivia: My problem is that I'm locked in a closet with you and Alan is off on some murderous adventure somewhere. Why are you wearing a policeman uniform?",
        "Sebastian: Uh, I don't know. I thought maybe you'd find it sexy.",
        "Olivia: You.",
        "Sebastian: Ow.",
        "Olivia: You helped him escape? Are you out of your mind?",
        "Sebastian: Hey. Hey, hey. Olivia, chill out, okay? If I helped Alan, why would he have locked me in here and left me for dead with you?",
        "Olivia: Somebody, please help! ( Exasperated sigh ) Help me!",
        "Sebastian: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Could we turn it down a few decibels? Okay? Like, maybe ten-and-a-half?",
        "Olivia: You know what? I need to get out of here. Somebody is counting on me. And you, you need to get used to living in little small confined spaces with Alan because you're going to be sharing a cell together! Hey!",
        "Sebastian: Now, why would you go and say something mean like that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: What are... what are you doing here?",
        "Jonathan: I walked by, saw my mom, started Jonesing for one of those Reva- riffic hugs.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, you know, I'm fresh out. You know? It's late. Late in the day.",
        "Jonathan: All right. I was just kidding about the punch you in the face thing. You know that.",
        "Reva: I don't know what to think anymore. Okay? What's up?",
        "Jonathan: I just had a chat with Aunt Olivia and we were talking about mothers.",
        "Reva: Olivia? You saw Olivia? When?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, she was knocking one down a while ago. Listen, my point is that a lot of stuff came out and I want to talk to you.",
        "Reva: About what?",
        "Jonathan: I've been really rough on you lately and there's a lot of hard things in my life I'm trying to let go of.",
        "Reva: I want to talk about all that stuff, Jonathan. I do, but can we just do it later?",
        "Jonathan: It's pretty important, Mom. I've been sitting on this...",
        "Reva: I need you to leave, okay? I need you to leave. Now. Get out of here. Right now. Go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: Johnny's right, isn't he, Reva? Your marriage is solid. And you know who I am. You lied to me, Reva, and I'm starting to get the feeling that you're trying to set me up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Jonathan, wait.",
        "Jonathan: No. Forget it. I heard you. I come over here to open up a vein and you don't have time to mop up? Did I miss something?",
        "Reva: No. I mean, you're finally listening for a change. It's just... you know, I guess everybody has their priorities.",
        "Jonathan: And I'm not one of yours?",
        "Reva: I'm maxed out.",
        "Jonathan: Of me?",
        "Reva: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Of you. I'm so over it, you know? I'm over jumping every time I hear you whimper. I know you're my son and all, but I am tired of you being stubborn and selfish and cruel, and I've had it up to here with your temper, you know? So just go. Go and find someone else that you can slap around for a while, okay?",
        "Jonathan: I don't even know why I bothered. Listen, whatever you get from now on, you deserve. And don't forget that, Mom. You have a good life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: Reva? Everything okay, love?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Lizzie, your mom only wants what's best for you. Right or wrong. Remember that, okay? There you go.",
        "Lizzie: Cassie, do you have to go? I mean, I really... I could use some advice from you. I mean, I know there has to be a trick to the whole relationship thing.",
        "Cassie: ( Sighs ) If there is, I haven't found it.",
        "Lizzie: That .. that's true. I guess you're not doing too well. Aren't you and Edmund done?",
        "Cassie: Yes, we are.",
        "Lizzie: At least you get to keep the rock.",
        "Cassie: Oh, the rock. Yes.",
        "Lizzie: You and my mother could own a jewelry stores with all the rings guys have given you.",
        "Cassie: Can we not talk about that?",
        "Lizzie: That's fine. I'm the one with the problem. I don't even have a ring from a guy.",
        "Cassie: Lizzie, you know, I'm not really any better than Roxy on giving you advice about relationships, but you know what? If it's meant to be, it will be. And if you guys can't get past the things that are in your way now, well, then maybe you're not supposed to be in this relationship. I don't know. Good luck.",
        "Lizzie: Thanks, Cassie. Sort of.",
        "Cassie: What am I waiting for? Okay. Well, Edmund, we tried, but it didn't work. ( Cell phone ring )",
        "Lizzie: It's Coop again.",
        "Coop: Lizzie? Where are you? Why did you run away? I know you're there. Just please... just talk to me.",
        "Lizzie: I can't do this.",
        "Coop: Lizzie? Wait, don't hang up. Don't... don't...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: What, did you think I was scared?",
        "Sebastian: ( Chuckles ) Yep. You still are. Maybe I should have taken a couple of practice swings, huh?",
        "Olivia: Could you hit it a little harder?",
        "Sebastian: ( Laughs ) I'm just warming up, baby. You know, maybe your heart wouldn't have beat so fast if you'd just had a little more faith in the people around you. ( Grunts )",
        "Olivia: Well, I will think about everything that you said. You need to think about having a little less faith in people.",
        "Sebastian: Ow.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: All right, Lizzie. You want me to track you down? Fine. If that's going to prove something to you, then... ( Cell phone rings ) Lizzie, listen to me. I am not in the mood to play... Frank. Hey, no. I'm actually just trying to keep this line clear in case Lizzie... what? What do you mean, he escaped? I thought you guys had him in custody. Right? Then how could Alan and... Sebastian? The guy who... yeah, no, I know who Sebastian is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Sebastian?",
        "Sebastian: Lizzie. What a pleasant surprise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Thanks. Well, you know, it's awfully weird. For the longest time, you have wanted Cassie to be happy. Forever.",
        "Edmund: Unfortunately, she has denied me that opportunity. But fortunately-- and very thoughtfully on her part-- she has provided me with the opportunity to make her life a misery, and that is exactly what I intend to do. So you see, we finally want the same thing, Dinah, and I was wondering if you could join me in making it happen.",
        "Dinah: You know I've wanted this to happen for a long time.",
        "Edmund: Then trust it.",
        "Dinah: How can I be so sure?",
        "Edmund: Let me prove myself to you, Dinah. I want to work long and hard to prove myself to you.",
        "Dinah: How?",
        "Edmund: Come back to my apartment. I'll show you.",
        "Dinah: Really?",
        "Edmund: Mm-hmm. I want you, Dinah, and only you.",
        "Dinah: Cassie.",
        "Edmund: What?",
        "Coop: Cassie. You haven't seen Lizzie, have you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Jonathan, this is your chance. You know, to stand up to him.",
        "Nate: Prove to me son, that that's the way you feel. Now, can I trust you to take down Reva, Josh, the whole lot of them.",
        "Reva: Take that rage that is inside you and you have to throw it in his face.",
        "Nate: ( Echoing ): I'm the only one who cares about you.",
        "Jonathan: Stop it. I know a way to stop you. For good.",
        "Reva: Is everything okay? I mean, the computer's still working and all?",
        "Nate: Oh, yeah. The hardware's fine.",
        "Reva: So, what are you doing? Just taking a break?",
        "Nate: Well, to be honest, Reva, I'm having a crisis of conscience. You see, I was doing what we discussed, taking the money that's rightly yours out of the Lewis account, transferring it into mine for safekeeping, and I just had one more button to press...",
        "Reva: And what happened?",
        "Nate: Well, I couldn't help but feel that all this going behind Josh's back, well, it's not right, love. Look, you have a justifiable claim on that money, so why don't I take you through it, step by step? You do the actual transfer.",
        "Reva: I am so bad with computers.",
        "Nate: Yeah, but I'll be right behind you, watching your every move. Reva, it comes down to simple morality. If you press the buttons and make the transfer, well, it's justifiable. If I press the buttons, that's just wrong. And I think you'd regret the deceit.",
        "Reva: Yeah... ( nervous laugh ) this is going to sound completely silly, but the last three computers that I touched, they crashed and I have sworn off the things completely.",
        "Nate: Yeah, and I understand you completely.",
        "Reva: Right. If the money doesn't get transferred into that account, then I have nothing. You know? Josh has left me with nothing.",
        "Nate: I find it hard to believe that things are really that bad between you.",
        "Reva: He feels convinced that I betrayed him with you and now he's going to make me pay.",
        "Nate: Oh. Shush, shush, shush. Come on. I'm sure things will work out for the best. I have to say, I do understand how your husband feels. Betrayal... betrayal can be devastating.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Cassie?",
        "Cassie: Yes, I saw Lizzie. About 20 minutes ago at the Beacon. Check the second floor near Room 202.",
        "Coop: 202. Thank you so much.",
        "Edmund: Hello.",
        "Cassie: Are you nuts? Propositioning Dinah just to get back at me for being with Jeffrey?",
        "Dinah: Hey. Thank you.",
        "Edmund: Our marriage is over, Cassie. And you have the unadorned hand to prove it. Dinah's important to me, and I didn't realize how important til now. And what better way to show her how grateful I am for all the trouble she's taken to carry our child?",
        "Jonathan: Hey, Dinah-mite. What are you doing still wearing that...",
        "Edmund: Dinah!",
        "Dinah: Jonathan, um, let's go over there. Cassie and Edmund need their privacy.",
        "Jonathan: To hell with them. Take off that stupid pad and come with me. We don't go deep so we don't hurt each other. Let's hit the road. I just came into some money. Come on. It's not like anything here is going to work out for either of us, anyway.",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Well, speak for yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: This is my grandfather's suite. What are you doing in here?",
        "Sebastian: Me? I mean, yeah, I was just about ready to ask you the same question.",
        "Lizzie: Maybe I wanted to go someplace where I could be alone. At least I thought I would be. My granddads in jail.",
        "Sebastian: ( Sighs )",
        "Lizzie: I mean, he wouldn't be here.",
        "Sebastian: Poor guy. I mean, it's a travesty. It's a tragedy. I mean, I don't even have the words to describe how I'm feeling.",
        "Lizzie: How about finding the words to describe what you're doing here?",
        "Sebastian: Oh. Um, well, your grandfather got a message to me and he asked me to retrieve all of the important files so that I could keep, you know, running the business while he's...",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, let me guess. You were just on your way to a really, really early Halloween party when you got that message.",
        "Sebastian: Oh, this. No. The place was surrounded by cops so I had to use my brain, you know? Be creative.",
        "Lizzie: Whatever. It had to be, like, the worst idea to come here.",
        "Sebastian: Oh. Do you want to talk about it?",
        "Lizzie: With you?",
        "Sebastian: Yeah. Why not? I mean, I'm available. You know, sometimes it's easier to talk to a stranger.",
        "Lizzie: You work for my family.",
        "Sebastian: Well, I know, but you and I don't really know each other that well yet.",
        "Lizzie: That's true. I mean, you were always really nice to me and Coop when... never mind.",
        "Sebastian: Ah. Ah, I see. So this is about Coop, right? It's not just about being upset over Alan.",
        "Lizzie: You know what? It's just... I don't have anyone. Nobody trusts me anymore. I don't have anybody who even listens to me.",
        "Sebastian: Well, you know what, Lizzie, what you... what you need to realize is that you've got to, I don't know, you've got to make people scared into hearing you, you know?",
        "Lizzie: No, I don't know. What are you talking about?",
        "Sebastian: What I'm saying is, you have to... you've got to make people figure out a way to make people realize that you're in control, that you're making the decisions, that it's all about you.",
        "Lizzie: How do I do that?",
        "Sebastian: You know what, Lizzie? I think I have an idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: There's something about your little situation that doesn't ring true to me, Reva.",
        "Reva: What? You don't believe that Josh and I are having problems?",
        "Nate: I've only been in town a little while, but even I've heard the legend of Josh and Reva. I've been told that your marriage has survived a hell of a lot worse than a little work flirtation. Its survived earthquakes, amnesia.",
        "Reva: Well, that's true. It is true. We've been through an awful lot together, but we're exhausted, and I think my interest in you was the last straw for him. I mean, he saw what was between us.",
        "Nate: Was?",
        "Reva: Or still is. I can't... I can't lie to you.",
        "Nate: No. You can't. That feeling that was there between us at the beginning, it's still there. It's as strong and true as the distance between you and Josh. There's nothing we can do about it. ( Pounding on door )",
        "Nate: Why don't I spend a moment in the kitchen while you...",
        "Reva: I think that's... I'll get rid of whoever it is.",
        "Nate: Don't keep me waiting, love.",
        "Reva: Ow.",
        "Olivia: That was good. I was going for the element of surprise. What?",
        "Reva: Ssh. Out, out, out.",
        "Olivia: It was kind of fun.",
        "Reva: I'm glad you think it was fun, but the plan is totally falling apart. On top of that, I think you broke my nose.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: Lizzie, here. Take the dog. I have an idea. Why don't you come to Florida with me? We'll go there overnight because there's a meeting down there with Spaulding investors. We'll take the corporate jet together.",
        "Lizzie: You want me to go away with you?",
        "Sebastian: Yeah. Come on. Lizzie, Lizzie, Lizzie, not everybody has ulterior motives.",
        "Lizzie: Since when?",
        "Sebastian: ( Laughs ) All right. Look, you're young, you're cynical, let me put it this way: You can disappear for a couple of days, get your family all worried about you and then you can move in and make your demands.",
        "Lizzie: What kind of demands?",
        "Sebastian: Well, whatever you want?",
        "Lizzie: I could move out. I mean, that would be great. Coop could come over whenever he wants and then he'll see that my mom is actually the crazy one.",
        "Sebastian: There you go. See? That's a good start. So, we taking off, kid?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. Give me two minutes. Um, I can get a bathing suit there, right?",
        "Sebastian: What are you doing?",
        "Lizzie: I just have to call Coop and let him know that...",
        "Sebastian: No, no, no, no, no. No, no. Don't. Hang up, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Why?",
        "Sebastian: Lizzie, listen to me. Listen. If you want to do this-- I mean really do this-- you've got to keep it a secret until you're surrounded by palm trees. You know what I'm saying?",
        "Lizzie: I guess. I just...",
        "Sebastian: You just what?",
        "Lizzie: I don't know how much I like this idea anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Tell me this isn't about Edmund again.",
        "Dinah: Things are different. Edmund wants me to wear the pad still, so we can torture Cassie together.",
        "Jonathan: Sounds like the beginning of a beautiful relationship.",
        "Dinah: Well, you know what? I mean, they say that, you know, couples, they should have something in common. Besides, I don't think this is any of your business.",
        "Jonathan: I hear \"Eddie\" and \"Baby\" in the same sentence, I make it my business. You're done being his incubator. Let's just get out of here. He doesn't care about you.",
        "Dinah: Jonathan, believe it or not, things are changing.",
        "Jonathan: Right. They are. Have a good life \"D.\"",
        "Dinah: What are you talking about?",
        "Jonathan: I just thought... oh, forget it. Whatever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You cannot sleep with Dinah.",
        "Edmund: Please, Cassie, please stop. All we do is... all we do is argue anymore. We promised we wouldn't. We'd try.",
        "Cassie: She is carrying...",
        "Edmund: Our baby.",
        "Cassie: Our baby.",
        "Edmund: Yes, I know, she's carrying our baby. Oh, that reminds me. I want to give you this.",
        "Cassie: What is it?",
        "Edmund: It's a present. Two parts. A book of baby names and an envelope. Please open it.",
        "Cassie: This is the contract I didn't sign. Edmund, we talked about this.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I failed as a husband. I failed. I don't want to fail as a father. I don't want to use this document against you. That would be crazy. Our child needs every advantage and that includes having both parents in his or her life. Cassie, we don't need to be together in order to raise this baby together, so sign it. Sign it and we'll have equal rights to the child.",
        "Cassie: You mean this?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, please don't doubt my sincerity. It's too important for both of us. Dinah, thank you. You can witness this. Cassie?",
        "Cassie: Thank you. Thank you.",
        "Edmund: It's my pleasure, Cassie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Two zero two. Two zero two. Four two-oh-two. Ha. Cassie said 202. Lizzie, hey! Come here. Lizzie, I know you're here. Roxy. Hey, hey. Come here, little girl. Come here, come here, come here, come here. You're here. That must mean that mommy's got to be here, too, right? Right? Mommy wouldn't leave you here. At least not by choice, would she?",
        "Lizzie: How's Roxy doing? Where is she?",
        "Sebastian: She's good. She's safe and sound and snuggled in.",
        "Lizzie: In the cargo thing?",
        "Sebastian: No, no. Chill out. She's in the compartment next to the pilot. She's on a silky little pillow sound asleep, so you chill out, relax, enjoy the flight, and you know what? Very soon you're going to be taking that tan to a whole different level, baby.",
        "Lizzie: Well, life could be worse, I guess.",
        "Sebastian: There you go. Keep sipping. You know what? Maybe before we take off, you might throw me a little \"thank you\" for talking you into this trip.",
        "Lizzie: I would have been stupid to turn it down after you threw in the spa package. And you're just totally right about not telling anybody.",
        "Sebastian: Totally.",
        "Lizzie: No one needs to know where I'm at every minute.",
        "Sebastian: Exactly. You ready to take off?",
        "Lizzie: I would stick my arms out the window and flap if I thought it would get us there any faster.",
        "Sebastian: Now you're talking Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Go tell the pilot \"Let's get this thing off the ground.\"",
        "Sebastian: Okay, I guess, you know what? We're not going to worry so much about certain people who are going to freak out when they find out we're missing, right?",
        "Lizzie: No, I mean, I will. My family and a few other people need to know that I can make decisions on my own. It's time for the world to find out I mean business.",
        "Sebastian: Lizzie, you took the words right out of my mouth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Oh.",
        "Olivia: Here. Here.",
        "Reva: Is it bleeding? You're late.",
        "Olivia: I'm sorry. It's a long story.",
        "Reva: Well, you know what? Edit yourself.",
        "Olivia: All right, I was locked in a closet with phony cop...",
        "Reva: I don't even want the details. Please. We've got worse things to worry about.",
        "Olivia: Alfred's inside.",
        "Reva: Yes. You know what? And he's backing off trying to take the money out of the Lewis account. I had to give him a little incentive or something, to make him feel like this bond between us was too strong to say no to.",
        "Olivia: Did you actually... did you...?",
        "Reva: Did I what?",
        "Olivia: Did you?",
        "Reva: No. No!",
        "Olivia: It's hanging out there. Well, why not do it? What better way to convince a guy to do something? Just go rub his feet and just make him do the transfer.",
        "Reva: Oh, right, right. I'm going to seduce him with a swollen nose.",
        "Olivia: You are being overly dramatic. You can't even. Just go. Just go do this.",
        "Reva: This is wrong. All of this is just so wrong.",
        "Olivia: I can't argue with you there. Just go. I will call the cops.",
        "Reva: I'm not going back in there with that monster.",
        "Olivia: You can do it, Champ.",
        "Reva: Okay. Nate? Nate? Nate! Olivia.",
        "Olivia: Would you shut up? He's going to hear us.",
        "Reva: No, he's not going to hear anything. Look. He's gone.",
        "Nate: I'm hoping I misunderstood what I just heard. You didn't just try to leave town with that bird, did you son?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Well, that settles that. All of our issues, parentally speaking of course, end with this document, and I think now I just have one final request.",
        "Cassie: Okay, what's that?",
        "Edmund: Well, I'd like this break to be as quick and clean as possible, so I'd like to gather my things from the farm, if that's all right.",
        "Cassie: Of course. Absolutely. I'll get everything ready.",
        "Edmund: Thank you.",
        "Cassie: Okay, um, this is good night.",
        "Edmund: Good night.",
        "Dinah: Good night.",
        "Edmund: I'm waiting for my applause now and I hope you're convinced about what I'm doing.",
        "Dinah: ( Applauds )",
        "Edmund: Thank you.",
        "Dinah: Well, I am very convinced that you are going to hurt her thoroughly, but I'm not so convinced that you aren't going to go running into her arms once again.",
        "Edmund: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: What, no videos, no music? What do you people expect me to do? Sebastian! Hello?",
        "Coop: Lizzie. Hello? Hello? Yeah. Where are you? Are you okay?",
        "Lizzie: Settle down, Henry.",
        "Coop: Gee, sorry for caring, there. I was just a little bit worried. My bad.",
        "Lizzie: No, what you're bad at is lying. You go behind my back and talk to my mom?",
        "Coop: What? No. Lizzie, listen to me for a second, okay?",
        "Lizzie: No, you listen to me, okay? I am sick and tired of people saying they care and then they turn around and stab me in the back.",
        "Coop: Lizzie. Lizzie, I have never meant to betray you or to even hurt you, but right now I need to know where you are, because Alan is...",
        "Lizzie: I don't care how he is. He can rot in jail with the rest of the murderers. He doesn't matter anymore, just like everything else back in Springfield. I've got to go.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, wait a minute. Wait a second.",
        "Lizzie: I've got to go. I'm leaving right now with Sebastian.",
        "Coop: Sebastian Hulce? No, Lizzie, you can't.",
        "Lizzie: Yes. I can. I am. Right now.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, listen to me for a second. Hold on. Sebastian, he's the one...",
        "Lizzie: Bye. ( Laughs ) He is so jealous.",
        "Sebastian: Hello, Alan, wherever you are. I hope you're picking up your messages because I just picked up a very valuable chip in our continued negotiations: Your precious little granddaughter, Lizzie. Now, I know you don't want anything bad to happen to your little girl, right? And I'll keep her safe and sound for, oh, a little while, not too long. So, if I were you, I would return my call. You have 24 hours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Hey, Jeffrey. It's Cassie. Look, I have great news. I just saw Edmund and he's not going to stand in our way anymore. I know, I hate to say this, but I think everything's going to be okay. More than okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Wow. I don't think I can wait for just one more night.",

        "Nate: Are you planning on leaving me now, son?",
        "Jonathan: Maybe you should leave. It's time.",
        "Nate: Uh, I don't think so. I still haven't got the money that I came here for, the money that I so clearly deserve. And to make matters more complicated, I now realize-- thanks to you-- that Reva's not to be trusted. It's just a new knot to be unraveled, one, which I think, will require rather drastic surgery.",
        "Jonathan: What are you going to do?",
        "Nate: Do you care?",
        "Jonathan: No. No, not really.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Well? Did he do it? Did he make the transfer?",
        "Reva: I don't know. I'm trying to figure out what happened.",
        "Olivia: He's not in the house, for what it's worth.",
        "Reva: Well, you know what? Maybe he figured it all out and he knows we were trying to set him up.",
        "Olivia: Maybe he just got scared when he heard my voice and took off.",
        "Reva: Look at this. Do you see what I see? Look. He did it. He transferred the money.",
        "Olivia: Okay, good.",
        "Reva: No, no, it's not good. He didn't put it in the account he was supposed to put it in. It's gone. It's gone. Nate and the money are gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: I try and I try. I give and I give. Now it's my turn to take. Payback for you, payday for me. _Next, on \"Guiding Light\"... _",
