        "Billy: Hey, you're up early.",
        "Reva: Oh, I was too excited to sleep I'm getting better, Billy. I can feel it my bones, that surgery worked. It's a beautiful house, Billy. Thank you for my gift.",
        "Billy: You know, I'm not so sure that it's a great idea for you to be out here in the sun like this.",
        "Reva: Oh, I've been out here not even ten minutes yet. And besides I'm all covered up.",
        "Billy: I know, but you know, it's, it's...",
        "Reva: Stop that! Stop being such a worry wart. Makes you no fun at all. You'll see. Those recent test results are going to come back and they're going to be just like the other ones. And then I will be back to Springfield, back to Joshua before you know it. ( Laughs )",

        "Nurse: Dr. McCabe. Mrs. Lewis's test results are in.",
        "Colin: Oh. Good.",
        "Nurse: I thought you'd want to see them right away.",
        "Colin: Yeah, thanks. Oh, Reva",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Okay, I can do this... it's not a big deal. The important part is just to get Josh to Reva... and away from me. So... \"Josh, there is a, uh, a veterans' group that... wants to give you their annual humanitarian award. And it is tomorrow night. So...\" okay. \"Josh, there is a... pharmaceuticals company that wants to contribute a sizable donation, and the only thing is, we have to seal the deal in person.\" Simple, good. That could work. ( Knocks on door )",
        "Josh: What's up?",
        "Cassie: ( Gasps )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: No, no, not there! Um, that's my evening wear box, and those are clearly casual.",
        "Maid: What's the difference? You're getting bigger every day.",
        "Lizzie: Excuse me?",
        "Maid: Just saying, you won't be going out on the town.",
        "Lizzie: Well, that's for me to decide, not you.",
        "Maid: I'll make sure I pack your tiara on top. ( Phone rings )",
        "Lizzie: Could you get that?",
        "Maid: Her majesty's line. Tammy Winstow?",
        "Lizzie: Winslow. Hey, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: Who was that?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, God. The new maid. She's awful. Are you guys all packed?",
        "Tammy: We're getting there. How about you?",
        "Lizzie: I'm... getting there. Ooh, um, wrap those in tissue paper.",
        "Tammy: You're wrapping something in tissue paper? How much stuff are you bringing, Lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: Just, um, the essentials. Look, Tammy, I want to say thank you again for what you and Jonathan are doing for me.",
        "Tammy: You're welcome. We're just trying to do what's right for the baby.",
        "Lizzie: Well, we are all going to be really, really happy. I know it. And, there's plenty of room at the penthouse. So I'll... see you there in a little while?",
        "Tammy: We'll be there. It's really happening. Moving in with Lizzie.",
        "Jonathan: Can't wait.",

        "Alan: Elizabeth?",
        "Lizzie: Granddad.",
        "Alan: Going somewhere?",
        "Lizzie: You got my note. I thought you were in a business meeting.",
        "Alan: Did you honestly think you could sneak away?",
        "Lizzie: I wasn't sneaking away, I left you a note.",
        "Alan: Yes, a note I wouldn't see until long after you were gone.",
        "Lizzie: Please, Granddad, I can't afford to get upset right now.",
        "Alan: You're absolutely right. That's why you shouldn't go anywhere, Elizabeth.",
        "Lizzie: I will not let you control my life!",
        "Alan: So you're off to live with Tammy and Jonathan, huh? What do you think that's going to accomplish?",
        "Lizzie: At least I'll be free.",
        "Alan: You're free to do whatever you want to now.",
        "Lizzie: You locked me in here, Granddad. You weren't going to let me out!",
        "Alan: What do you think your mother is going to do when she find this out? Your mother has just lost a baby, now you are deserting her!",
        "Lizzie: Give it up, Granddad. You are twisting this into something it's not. Who's out there?",
        "Alan: I was hoping we could resolve this ourselves.",
        "Lizzie: What have you done?",
        "Alan: Doctor, you can come in.",
        "Baker: Hello, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: You again. How much is he paying you?",
        "Alan: It doesn't matter, Elizabeth.",
        "Lizzie: I want you to go. I want him gone, Granddad. I want him gone right now! Now, now! I want him gone now!",
        "Alan: All right, all right.",
        "Baker: I'm afraid I can't do that.",
        "Lizzie: Where is mom?",
        "Alan: She's with your grandmother.",
        "Lizzie: I'm calling her, right now.",
        "Alan: There's no need to do that, Elizabeth.",
        "Lizzie: Oh yeah?",
        "Alan: We can settle this. We've always been able to talk.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, right. As long as you're doing the talking and I'm doing the listening. And that isn't going to work anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: What? What am I doing wrong?",
        "Tammy: You are doing everything right. Moving in with Lizzie, helping with her and the baby, I'm really proud of you.",
        "Jonathan: You're a freak, do you know that? Another girl would move in with me and the...",
        "Tammy: The girl that's having your kid?",
        "Jonathan: Well, I was going to say the girl that I knocked up, but okay. Hey, if I were you, I would have dumped me.",
        "Tammy: It's not that I like the situation. Or that there aren't moments where I... still see you two together. I don't want you to miss out on any of your daughter's life, okay?",
        "Jonathan: Like your dad did with you?",
        "Tammy: Maybe.",
        "Jonathan: You know, you never really talk about him.",
        "Tammy: It just... makes me sad that he didn't want to be there. You to know to take care of me and... watch me grow up.",
        "Jonathan: Come here. So. You still think this is going to be a good idea when we lose all of our privacy?",
        "Tammy: It's just for a few months.",
        "Jonathan: A few months?! Oh...",
        "Tammy: Hey. We'll live. Jonathan I don't know. But I think I'm finished packing.",
        "Tammy: You are?",
        "Jonathan: Mm-hmm. And I think, um... we need to make up for lost time...",
        "Tammy: We haven't lost any time.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, but we will. I need something to remember you by so I don't go crazy while we're move in with lizard. Come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: How long were you standing out there spying on me?",
        "Josh: Hey, you're the one that was camped outside of my door, Cassie, all right? And by the way, do you always talk to yourself?",
        "Cassie: Come on, everybody talks to themselves. Don't they?",
        "Josh: If you say so.",
        "Cassie: Okay, stop. We have important business to attend to.",
        "Josh: You know, I thought I told you to take the day off.",
        "Cassie: You did, yeah. But... something came up. And... we have to go to New York.",
        "Josh: What, right now?",
        "Cassie: Yes, right now. So we don't have much time. So where is your briefcase?",
        "Josh: It's right over there. Wh... why are we going to New York? What's in New York?",
        "Cassie: Uh, I got a call last night, a guy named Soto, who apparently has a foundation with a ton of money, and it's like millions of dollars or something. And they want to contribute, but the deal is, they need to close in person.",
        "Josh: Why have I never heard of this guy? Wh... what's the name of the foundation that you're talking about?",
        "Cassie: I actually don't remember that, but I wrote it down. I'll fill you in on the plane.",
        "Josh: Cassie, I can't... I haven't packed any clothes, you know.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, uh, I did it for you.",
        "Josh: Excuse me?",
        "Cassie: Yes. I went to Cross Creek and I packed up a bag of your clothes. It's already in the trunk of my car. So if we don't go, we're going to blow this.",
        "Josh: Okay. Yeah, here's the thing. I can't just pick up and leave like that, okay?",
        "Cassie: Why not?",
        "Josh: Because, I...",
        "Cassie: What's keeping you here?",
        "Josh: Nothing. Nothing is keeping me here. Let's go to New York.",
        "Cassie: Let's go to New York.",
        "Josh: Okay. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: You know what? After my first chemo session, the smell of flowers made me nauseous. I missed it.",
        "Billy: These smell good.",
        "Reva: They do. You're hovering. Billy, why are you doing that? I'm feeling fine.",
        "Billy: Yeah, I think that. I know you are, but, just, um...",
        "Reva: What?!",
        "Billy: Well, I... I just don't want you to get ahead of yourself here.",
        "Reva: I got good news, Billy. Let me enjoy it.",
        "Billy: I know. And that news could be the light at the end of the tunnel, but I just... you got to go through the tunnel yet. You've got to go back to the clinic, get more treatments, you might even get some roadblocks...",
        "Reva: I know all that.",
        "Billy: Okay. I just want you to know you can't go jumping back into Josh's arms just yet.",
        "Reva: Billy... you found this house for me. You stocked it full of all of my favorite things. Including you. Let me enjoy the day.",
        "Billy: How about we enjoy it together.",
        "Reva: Okay! Starting with breakfast. You know what? I actually think my stomach could have a nice, big breakfast.",
        "Billy: Okay, well, how about bacon and eggs?",
        "Reva: And pancakes. Strawberry pancakes.",
        "Billy: Ooh! You're going to let me eat all that?",
        "Reva: I am. Because you need your energy, because you're going to row me across that lake.",
        "Billy: You got a deal.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) ( knock at door ) Hey! You're just in time for breakfast. Or maybe not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Why did he stop me? I wasn't speeding.",
        "Josh: No?",
        "Cassie: No! And don't you say a word. I'm going to handle this.",
        "Josh: What are you doing?",
        "Cassie: Guess.",
        "Josh: You're not. Cassie.",
        "Cassie: This is all your fault.",
        "Josh: My fault?",
        "Cassie: Yes. If you hadn't been so resistant back at the Beacon, we'd be halfway to the airport by now. And if this guy doesn't hurry up, we're going to miss this flight altogether.",
        "Josh: Cassie, there will be other flights.",
        "Cassie: What is this man doing?",
        "Josh: Probably making sure that you're not a convicted felon.",
        "Cassie: ( Sighs ) Well... I'm going to go back there.",
        "Josh: That's not a good idea. They don't like it when you do that.",
        "Cassie: I cannot sit here and wait for him to take his sweet time.",
        "Josh: Cassie, what the hell is wrong with you?",
        "Cassie: Nothing. I just... we have to... I want to get to the airport, we have got to get to the airport. Finally! Hi, officer. I'm sorry, we are really late for a flight. Is there any way you could just cut us a little bit of a break...?",
        "Cop: I don't cut breaks.",
        "Cassie: But I wasn't speeding.",
        "Cop: Ma'am...",
        "Cassie: I wasn't speeding! Josh, would you tell him?",
        "Josh: How you doing, officer?",
        "Cassie: Okay, um... maybe you recognize me? I'm Cassie Winslow. Princess Cassie Winslow.",
        "Cop: And I'm the Duke of Wales.",
        "Cassie: Okay, look, you don't even... I cannot even explain how important it is that we...",
        "Cop: Ma'am, if you're not going to cooperate, I need you to step out of the car.",
        "Cassie: I don't think so.",
        "Cop: Out. Both of you. Now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colin: Why don't you sit down?",
        "Reva: I don't want to sit down. Why did you have to do this today, huh? Why today?",
        "Colin: This couldn't wait... you know that.",
        "Reva: Well, as it turns out, I don't know much of anything.",
        "Colin: Just sit.",
        "Reva: My cancer's spreading, isn't it?",
        "Colin: Yes. Yes, it is. After the initial tests, we were optimistic, but as I explained...",
        "Reva: So, what? Plan B?",
        "Colin: We need to move on this as quickly as possible.",
        "Reva: \"Move on it,\" as in, I have to go back to the clinic? Where you'll give me massive doses of chemo and radiation... blast my body so that my immune system is completely wiped out, so we can start over from scratch with my stem cells...",
        "Colin: I'll explain exactly what will happen once we get back, but... maybe you should get your things.",
        "Billy: Hey, breakfast is all ready. Oh, hey, Doc, didn't see you come in. Plenty of food for you too.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, we don't have to worry about that now, Billy.",
        "Billy: Reva...",
        "Reva: It was good while it lasted.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I will not let you bully me anymore. It's always been your way or no way at all, and I am sick of it!",
        "Alan: That is not fair...",
        "Lizzie: You had a chance to help me get Coop back. Granddad, you ruined my chances with him forever!",
        "Alan: He was not good enough for you! Now it is time for you to face the hard facts. And he has moved on.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, actually, I don't blame him. Why would he want to put up with my awful family...",
        "Alan: Your family is very caring and close, and you know it!",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, nothing says caring like a good lockdown.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth. I did that for the welfare of your baby.",
        "Lizzie: I would never hurt my baby, Granddad!",
        "Alan: You were on the hospital roof! It makes one wonder!",
        "Lizzie: You don't care about me at all. It's all about the baby!",
        "Alan: I am concerned about both of you.",
        "Lizzie: I don't believe you. Do you remember when I was a little girl? You said that I was the future of this family, and the company. You took me to work with you, and you let me sit behind your desk in your chair. And you gave me a briefcase. And you said that I was going to need that someday! You trusted me, you had faith in me... and when? When did that stop? When, exactly, Granddad, did you decide to write me off?!",
        "Alan: You're being ridiculous.",
        "Lizzie: No, I'm not. I'm not, you don't... you don't see me anymore. All you see is a baby. A baby that you haven't even met. It's like my only purpose in life now is to deliver her to you!",
        "Alan: This is not about me. This is about you.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, my God, I've got to get out of here.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth. Tell my why you want to go live with Jonathan and Tammy.",
        "Lizzie: Because they support me. And they... I don't know, they kind of believe in me. Imagine that! Because I'm never going to get that from my family. Goodbye, Granddad. Please don't try to stop me!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: What kind of smile is that?",
        "Jonathan: It's the \"I can't believe how lucky I am\" smile. You like it?",
        "Tammy: I kind of do, actually.",
        "Jonathan: I keep thinking I'm going to wake up and everything's going to be ripped away from me again.",
        "Tammy: You're not dreaming.",
        "Jonathan: It feels like it sometimes.",
        "Tammy: Would you stop? This is real. You and I are real. And I'm not going anywhere. Even if things change.",
        "Jonathan: Nothing's going to change.",
        "Tammy: Yes, it is. You're going to have a daughter. Another life that you're responsible for.",
        "Jonathan: I never said I was doing that.",
        "Tammy: You are though, whether you know it or not. I love you, Jonathan. Whatever happens with the baby isn't going to change how I feel.",

        "Billy: Yeah, but Doc, she looks good, she feels... she's even hungry.",
        "Reva: You know what, Billy, this... this place is great, and spending this time here with you... well, you know what? You're just about the best friend a person could ask for in this whole wide world. But I have to go back to the clinic now.",
        "Billy: What about breakfast and the rowboat and everything...?",
        "Reva: Well, you know, we're going to have to take a rain check on all those things. Hopefully I'll be around to cash in on it.",
        "Billy: You stop that.",
        "Reva: I'm sorry. Can you pack my things and bring them by later? Thanks. Let me just grab these things. Okay. Hey, I'm not giving up. I'm going to fight this thing dirtier than ever. Right, Doc?",
        "Colin: Oh yeah. Pulling hair, gouging eyes, the whole thing. I'll go start the car.",
        "Billy: I can't believe this is happening.",
        "Reva: Hey, you were the one that told me that I shouldn't get my hopes up.",
        "Billy: I know, but I just, you know...",
        "Reva: You know what, Billy? When have you known me never to not beat something, right? This is no different. Consider this thing whooped... even if it does mean I have to go live in a little bubble for a while. You know, I'll just be... Reva, the bubble girl. ( Laughs ) I'm going to win. I'm going to win, and then I'm going to get back here, I'm going to get back to my life, and back to you and back to Josh and back to my kids.",

        "Lizzie: That's everything. I think.",
        "Jonathan: What is all this crap?",
        "Lizzie: My things. I actually packed light. All my winter stuff is being stored at the house. Which drawers could I have?",
        "Jonathan: Shoes... casual shoes... extra shoes... post-labor wear...?",
        "Lizzie: I cannot wait to not have to wear these big old clothes anymore.",
        "Jonathan: You are out of your head.",
        "Tammy: ( Sneezes )",
        "Lizzie: Bless you.",
        "Tammy: Thank you. You did bring a lot of stuff, though, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: I have to be comfortable, don't I?",
        "Jonathan: Comfortable?! There's not even enough room to walk around in here!",
        "Lizzie: All right, look, I'm going to unpack, and you won't even know that I'm here, okay?",
        "Jonathan: I'll know.",
        "Lizzie: Are you guys having second thoughts?",
        "Tammy: ( Sneezes )",

        "Alan: Elizabeth is moving into the Beacon with Jonathan Randall and his cousin-love.",
        "Beth: Alan, she is trying to prove her independence to you.",
        "Alan: This is not a time to be independent. She is young, she is pregnant, she is not married, she needs to be surrounded by her family, Beth.",
        "Beth: Okay, fine, then may I point out something to you that is pushing her away from her family! You are hurting her by acting like she's not important now that this baby is coming along.",
        "Alan: Of course she is important. She is a grown woman who's about to have a child, and she needs to be...",
        "Beth: Okay, Alan, then what is it? Is she a grown woman? Or is she a child?",
        "Alan: She is what she is. The damage is done. But that little baby, on the other hand, is our fresh start.",
        "Beth: I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that. If Lizzie is damaged goods, what am I? What are you?",
        "Alan: You, Beth, are my strong and beautiful wife. I am a man who is trying to find my redemption. And I will find it in the eyes of that little baby. Isn't it a little early for you as well?",
        "Beth: Mmm, it's funny, I was thinking that it was too late.",
        "Alan: Absolutely not, Beth. There are many good things ahead of us. Everything is going to fall into place. You'll see.",

        "Josh: Yeah, well you know what, she knows where I am. If she wants to find me, she can come to me!",
        "Cassie: You know you want to be with her. Would you just go be with her? You have to be with her.",
        "Josh: Do I? Really.",
        "Cassie: Yes.",
        "Josh: Why are you doing this right now? What's with the urgency?",

        "Josh: It's just time, Cassie?",
        "Cassie: It's time!",
        "Josh: It's time?! Let me ask you a question. What were you going to do at the airport, huh? You thought that I was just going just... get on to the plane, no questions asked!?",
        "Cassie: I don't know.",
        "Josh: Why are you acting this way?",
        "Cassie: What way?",
        "Josh: I'm having a little trouble figuring you out right now, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Well, would you stop? Just stop trying. Okay? And stop torturing me, and go back...",
        "Josh: Torturing you?",
        "Cassie: Yes! Yes! Torturing me!",
        "Josh: How am I torturing you?!",
        "Cassie: You are constantly torturing me! I have feelings for you, Josh! All right? I... I didn't mean for it to happen. But we spend so much time together... and you just... you're just... an amazing guy. Oh my God, I hate this. Okay, I hate this. You're my sister's husband, and I shouldn't be saying any of this to you. But I have to say it. Because you need to know, because I can't take it anymore. You have to go to Minnesota. You have to get Reva and bring her back here so I will stop wanting. It's the only way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I don't know why they made me get in a bed. I don't need to be in a bed.",
        "Billy: Darling. You've got to stop giving the nurses such a hard time.",
        "Reva: It's just that one. You know, that Lana, the blonde. She's the worst one. She's pushy!",
        "Billy: Look, they've all been real good to you.",
        "Reva: Still the rules in this place are stupid.",
        "Colin: Uh, sorry about that. Where were we, guys?",
        "Reva: We didn't get very far... you were just about to tell me what comes next.",
        "Colin: Right, um... ( clears throat )",
        "Reva: You're learning.",
        "Colin: So, the first step is to give you massive amounts of chemotherapy and radiation. Which, like I said before, it will wipe out all the cancer cell but it will also wipe out your immune system.",
        "Billy: Once we kill all the cancer, when does she get better?",
        "Colin: Well, the next step is this stem cell rescue. Basically, we'll be injecting you with your own stem cells, which we harvested from you the last surgery we did, and that will restart your immune system.",
        "Reva: And I'm good as new.",
        "Colin: Yeah, that's the hope. But again, this is a very new procedure, Reva. We've just started using it with breast cancer patients. So you still have the option to change your mind.",
        "Reva: No. Now, we're going for it.",
        "Billy: What's the alternative... I mean, if that doesn't work?",
        "Colin: A bone marrow transplant.",
        "Billy: That's from somebody else, right",
        "Reva: What then, so I...I'm involved in this thing, and... my immune system is totally shot, and I really am, what, the bubble girl?",
        "Colin: Well, yes, you will need to be quarantined. For now, your immune system will be very weak... well, nonexistent. The slightest infection could kill you.",
        "Reva: Hoo, wow, so that's it, huh? No more sun, no more outside.",
        "Colin: For now. So, I'll go ahead and start getting it set up.",

        "Lizzie: Ugh, I don't believe it. I don't believe it, Roxy. No one could be allergic to you, my big, sweet girl!",
        "Tammy: I'll go get some allergy medicine.",
        "Lizzie: I just gave her a bath the day before yesterday. I could give her another one.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, yeah, do that. Fill the up the bathtub really high, and stick her...",
        "Tammy: Jonathan.",
        "Lizzie: It's okay, Tammy, it is kind of tight in here. And we're bound to get irritated with each other from time to time. But it's cool. I have money to burn, and this is not going to be like this for much longer. I'm starving. Do you guys want to get something to eat?",
        "Jonathan: How about you stay here and unpack? We'll bring you something back.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. Whatever you say.",
        "Tammy: What are you in the mood for?",
        "Lizzie: Surprise me.",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs )",
        "Lizzie: Okay. Should we unpack or should we watch some TV? TV? Okay. Roxy, you are the boss, that's what we'll do. ( Knock at door ) I told you guys that you could surprise me.",

        "Reva: You know what today reminds me of, Billy? The day I married Joshua at Cross Creek. I don't know if it was the lake or if it was the flowers... maybe it was just the color of the day, you know that blue... or how bright the sun was... how bright the future.",
        "Billy: Hey. You're going to be back. And next time we'll take the boat out.",
        "Reva: Okay. Could you do me a favor? Go get the doctor for me?",
        "Billy: Yeah, sure. Hey, look. I know you're saying goodbye to the light, but you're really just saying \"I'll see you later.\"",
        "Reva: Right.",
        "Billy: Okay.",
        "Reva: ( Sighs )",
        "Colin: What's going on?",
        "Reva: Um... well, you know, I know that you're a doctor and all, and that you're just... you're into numbers and.. ( laughs ) probabilities and beating the disease. And, you know, I'm always up for a good fight. The thing is... I've been keeping this from my family for so long now. And I don't want to burden them now either. But I need you to be honest with me. I mean, if... my time is over, if there comes a time when it's... time to give up, you have to let me know. Because I can't... I can't let it pass by without saying goodbye.",
        "Colin: Yeah. You've got a long way to go, Reva. But if that time does ever come, I, uh... I will let you know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Josh? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said any of that to you. But it's why... it's why I am trying to push you to Reva. I was hoping to do it before any of this came out and I... had a chance to embarrass myself. And you. And I hoped it would just go away, but it hasn't, and... it has been so hard for me to keep it in, and... but I still should have found a way to keep my mouth shut, so I'm sorry, Josh. Would you say something? Anything? Okay, look, I know... I realize that having these feelings for you is... it's just stupid. It's stupid.",
        "Josh: It's not stupid.",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Josh: It's not stupid. Because... because... I feel it, too.",

        "Next, on \"Guiding Light\"...",
        "Tammy: She's gone. Something happened to her.",
        "Lizzie: And now they're talking about how crazy I am. This is not about bringing me home, mom. Where are you sending me?",
        "Colin: So I had this sterilized for you. Billy got it to me.",
        "Josh: I guess I couldn't hold it inside anymore either.",
