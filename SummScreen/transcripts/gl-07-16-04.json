Look, the food and drinks are over there, okay? You guys seen tony? (Music playing) that lying skunk.", "Tony: Oh, you're right on time. So you got it, huh? It's all here?", "Otto: Check it out.", "Tony: Beautiful. Looks like the zoning commissioner is about to be our new best friend. (Cell phone ringing) in fact, that's probably him right now. Yeah?", "Michelle: So you think you can just blow me off?", "Tony: Oh, well, michelle, i never promised i'd be at the party. In fact, it turns out that i can't make it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: Oh, come on, tony. I've got a house full of teenagers here. I could use a little muscle, you know, to keep them in line. Plus, if you don't show up, I'm going to come and get you myself and it's not going to be pretty.", "Danny: Hey.", "Michelle: Hey.", "Danny: Nice party.", "Michelle: Is it? Good, I hope so. You know, it feels like one of those nights that anything can happen.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: This is so much fun, joey. You don't understand. This whole night is incredible. I feel like one of you guys instead of the young spaulding heiress, elizabeth.", "Joey: It isn't so bad being one of the little people, is it?", "Lizzie: I didn't mean it like that.", "Joey: (Laughs)", "lizzie: You're bad. Stop it! (Laughs)", "joey: I'm going to get us something to drink, okay? All right, all right, all right. The little people surrender. Oh, my...", "Lizzie: Oh, you better surrender.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sandy: Has she taken any prisoners yet?", "Tammy: She's working really hard. You know, I can't kid myself anymore. I love joey. And I can't stand watching lizzie drool all over him.", "Sandy: It's time to move in or move on.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alexandra: Gus! Oh, what a nice surprise. I was just hoping I'd run into you, you know that? And here you are. Well. (Laughs)", "gus: That's terrific.", "Alexandra: Happy coincidence.", "Gus: Good seeing you again. You look like you're in a good mood.", "Alexandra: Well, I am, of course. Why not? My nephew is getting married.", "Gus: And you're not going to jail for drug trafficking. It's great.", "Alexandra: Thanks to that same nephew, yes. All is right with the world.", "Gus: Why are you acting like this? Because just earlier you were worried that i was going to rat you out to harley, remember?", "Alexandra: Okay, well, there was a moment of doubt there. It's because i realize how difficult this whole wretched business has been for you, but it's going to be behind us very soon.", "Gus: Yeah, well, maybe, maybe not.", "Alexandra: No, I know in my mind it will be. So where is harley?", "Gus: She's going to make a little spa day with her girlfriends, with reva and cassie over at the farm and I've got to go to the police station, I guess. Tie up my loose ends, you know?", "Alexandra: Oh, you can't do that! No.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Frank: Hey, kenny. Did I miss anything while I was gone? All right. Hey, ross. What's going on?", "Ross: These are investigators parker, bishop and stein. They're from internal affairs. I expect you to give them your full cooperation.", "Frank: Internal affairs? What, is this about that phone tip that you got yesterday?", "Ross: Yeah, it is.", "Frank: Ross, I told you yesterday that this department is clean. I can't believe that you would rather listen to some anonymous phone caller than me.", "Ross: Frank, I have to follow up on it. I have no choice.", "Frank: Well, in other words, you just don't believe me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: I think it's working.", "Harley: Hi.", "Reva: Hi.", "Harley: I'm sorry i'm late.", "Reva: That's okay, you're a bride-to-be. You're very busy. And very happy, from the looks of things.", "Harley: Yeah. I was just seeing gus.", "Cassie: Oh, she doesn't need a massage.", "Reva: No. Very relaxed. (Laughter)", "harley: Yeah, i'm a little relaxed. (Laughs)", "cassie: Oh, great. Did you tell housekeeping that you used the room?", "Harley: Sorry.", "Reva: Hey, shush. If you don't want your turn, that's fine. I'll take another.", "Harley: No, no. I came all this way and I am getting my massage.", "Massage therapist: Here's a towel.", "Harley: Thank you.", "Cassie: I don't know if your gift is gone, reva, because you said i needed this massage and you were right.", "Reva: Well, it doesn't take a psychic to know that the victim of identity theft could use a little r&r.;", "Cassie: That other cassie, she can just eat her heart out. (Laughs)", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "jeffrey: Now, you didn't honestly think that you could go on impersonating cassie winslow and get away with it, did you?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dinah: I see you still have the beard. I like it. It's rough, just like you.", "Jeffrey: Stop it. I'm shutting you down, okay? Your game is over, tonight.", "Dinah: The game was a lot more fun when you were a part of it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "ross: All right, you have access to anything and everything. Just take your time and please get it right.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Frank: You think I'm running a crooked police department, ross?", "Ross: No, i don't, frank. I'm trying to help you. Questions have been raised.", "Frank: By an anonymous phone caller?", "Ross: The allegations were specific and serious and it is my job to see that they are either proved or disproved.", "Frank: Let me give you some advice, ross. I don't think it's a very good idea to antagonize the police department so early on in your term.", "Ross: Don't go there, frank. Listen, if there's a dirty cop in your department, don't you want to know about it?", "Frank: I already know there isn'T.", "Ross: Well, then there's nothing to worry about. If there's no dirt to be found, ia is not going to come up with anything, are they?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: Well, now, why shouldn't i go down to the police station?", "Alexandra: Because it is the last place in the world you should be tonight, particularly when you have a lovely fiancee waiting to spend time with you.", "Gus: I just told you that she's got plans.", "Alexandra: Well, they can't be very important if they don't include you, can they?", "Gus: We're not exactly conjoined twins. We're not joined at the hip.", "Alexandra: All right, well, i don't like the sound of that.", "Gus: What are you saying?", "Alexandra: Well, usually couples who have an impending marriage, you know, when they're so much in love, want to spend every waking moment together before...", "Gus: We were just together, just now.", "Alexandra: So you're now content to go down to the police station, just...", "Gus: We're not in any trouble because she's having a massage.", "Alexandra: Oh, all right. Maybe I am overreacting, but look, gus, it's just that i couldn't live with myself if i thought I was the one driving this wedge between you and harley. Now, come on. You said so yourself this was a concern.", "Gus: Don't worry about it. She seems to be fine lately.", "Alexandra: Fine. Then ain't things wonderful?", "Gus: What are you talking about? What is this about?", "Alexandra: Oh, honestly. When are you going to look me in the eye and not see a liar?", "Gus: Probably never. It doesn't matter that i'm a liar, too, so... And we're in this particular lie together and we're just going toth have to stick it... Stick it out and see what happens, and hope for the best.", "Alexandra: What about the police station?", "Gus: I don't feel like going to the police station now. Going down there, playing honorable chief of detectives, no thank you. It just doesn't appeal to me all of a sudden.", "Alexandra: Come on, cheer up. This thing is going to be behind us very soon and i also have a feeling that frank is going to drop this entire investigation and we can get back to living our lives. Oh, come on. You'll see.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Ah, life is good.", "Reva: You know, i thought you'd be at the point in your wedding planning where you'd want to commit murder.", "Harley: No, not yet.", "Cassie: She's a slow starter.", "Reva: But it's the spauldings. It's hard enough living in the same town with them, as marrying one.", "Harley: Yeah. And don't think I wasn't sweating it going into this thing, because we both know I'm a two-time loser when it comes to that family. But alan and alex have been very pleasant.", "Reva: You know what? Don't press so hard. You're cutting off all the blood from the feet to the brain. (Laughter)", "harley: I am serious. They have gone out of their way to be totally cooperative. And the weird thing is, so have i.", "Cassie: How so?", "Harley: Well, you know, the spauldings want to make this wedding a bit more of an event than i had originally intended, and I'm just going with it.", "Reva: I have never heard you say that ever, about anything, in my life.", "Harley: Well, i have never loved anyone as much as I love gus. And as long as he's getting what he wants with this wedding, I'm happy, because i could get married in the back of a cab. I don't care. I just want to be his wife.", "Cassie: That's how I felt when i married richard. Really. And talk about a wedding. Ours really was a state affair. Do you remember? (Laughs)", "harley: But you know what i remember about your wedding that i loved? It was the little things. It was the subtle touches, like when you took all those pills and you couldn't walk down the aisle and we had to give you, like, a gallon of coffee. (Laughter)", "cassie: Oh, gosh. I thought it was going to be a circus and when I walked down the aisle, all those people were looking at me. But there was richard, standing at the altar waiting for me. And the best part was when all the hoopla was over, i was married to the man i loved.", "Reva: That's the general idea.", "Cassie: It was such a fairy tale. It didn't just stop with the wedding, though. I mean, when i realized that i could make a difference in people's lives and help the people in san cristobel, and it was only a phone call away, it was just amazing.", "Harley: That's the nice thing about being a princess.", "Cassie: It was a long time ago. At least it seems like it. Oh, speaking of princesses, i went on a royalty gossip web site.", "Reva: Well, of course you did.", "Cassie: I wanted to see if i could get any information on the person who is posing as me, and guess what?", "Harley: You got a hit.", "Cassie: Lots of them. Oh, yes. Tons of parties. Princess cassie gets around.", "Harley: Well, you think that maybe one of your friends from the royal party circuit would have notified you of this.", "Cassie: I've never even heard of half of these events, so i don't think the people i knew went to these things.", "Harley: Well, did you get a picture of her? Was there anything?", "Cassie: No. Nothing. I mean, this woman went to a lot of trouble to cover her tracks. Well, kind of.", "Reva: Cassie, she's been impersonating you in public at very high-profile events. That's pretty blatant.", "Cassie: I know. It's as if she wanted me to get some information, just not all of it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: I said, stop it.", "Dinah: Okay. What? I missed you, that's all. I just... I don't know, I don't think your voice did it for me on the phone.", "Jeffrey: I knew i couldn't trust you. That's why i'm here to deliver this message personally. This has to stop, dinah.", "Dinah: Why? I'm having so much fun. You used to have fun, too. You remember the fun we used to have, don't you?", "Jeffrey: She's onto you.", "Dinah: Who?", "Jeffrey: Well, I'll give you one guess. Here's a hint: You shot and killed the man that she loved.", "Dinah: I loved hart, too. How do you know cassie is onto me? Did she find you? Oh. It was the other way around, wasn't it? Good for you. You finally did it. You're living in springfield. I should have known that's where you'd go-- right after cassie.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: Tony! Whoo! You made it!", "Tony: Hello. (Laughs)", "danny: I didn't know you were coming over.", "Tony: Well, you know, michelle, she gave me an offer i guess I couldn't refuse. So i'm here.", "Michelle: And you are going to be glad you're here. Wait until you see all the ladies that are here.", "Tony: A little young, don't you think?", "Michelle: Not all of them. Excuse me! Ladies over 18! Raise your hands! Whoo! There you go. Enjoy.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marina: What is up with her?", "Shayne: Well, she's having fun, i guess.", "Marina: Yeah, well, danny looks kind of horrified.", "Sandy: I don't know, I think there's something to be said for getting a new crack at things.", "Shayne: I hear that.", "Marina: Well, me, too, as long as you don't forget what's important to you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Joey: (Laughs)", "lizzie: You know, your voice is a thousand times better than this guy's.", "Joey: Nah.", "Lizzie: No, no, no. Don't they look great together?", "Joey: Lizzie? Chill, okay? You don't have to try so hard. I'm here with you, so just... You know. I'm going to go get us some refills. Refills.", "Lizzie: Hey. Cool party, huh?", "Tammy: Uh-huh.", "Lizzie: Fyi that joey still cares about you. Yeah, he was saying how great you and remy look together, and he's really happy for you. That you found someone else.", "Tammy: Well, too bad I can't say the same thing for joey. He looks like he's having a miserable time.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tony: She hates this song, huh?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: Yeah, obviously.", "Michelle: Come on, dance with me.", "Danny: Who?", "Michelle: Either of you. Both. I don't care. I just want to dance. Come on.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ross: Frank, I know this isn't easy, but it will be over quicker if you let them do their jobs.", "Frank: Yeah, you're absolutely right, ross. A quick witch-hunt is always better.", "Alexandra: Well. Hello ross, frank.", "Frank: Alex. Back so soon?", "Alexandra: Well, actually i was hoping i'd find gus here. I had a little family matter i want to discuss with him.", "Frank: Oh, really? Well, you know what? He's not here. And if you haven't noticed, alex, this is a police station, so if you want to conduct your personal business, do it somewhere else.", "Alexandra: Well, he's in a foul mood.", "Ross: I can't say that i blame him, alex.", "Alexandra: Oh. Has frank gotten some bad news?", "Ross: I hope not.", "Alexandra: What are all these men doing here?", "Ross: They're from internal affairs.", "Alexandra: Really? Why?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Thank you! This was such a great idea.", "Reva: Oh, good. If you get the wedding jitters or if the spauldings revert back to type, you call me and we'll do this again.", "Harley: We'll do this again anyway, because this was great, but I think I'm really okay. I'm, like, 99% sane right now. Well, low 90s, probably, but come on, that's good for me.", "Cassie: Hey, that is great, considering everything you've been through with the spauldings.", "Harley: Yeah, i'm telling you, it's gus. He is... He's being amazing. He's so patient and understanding.", "Reva: Because he loves you.", "Harley: And i love him. I love him so much. I'm telling you, as long as we're together we can get through any insanity. See you guys.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie and reva: Bye.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: Wow, she's so good!", "Reva: And you?", "Cassie: I'm fine. Okay, what part of \"fine\" don't you believe?", "Reva: The part-- sit down-- the part where someone is impersonating you, cassie.", "Cassie: Oh, yeah.", "Reva: That part.", "Cassie: Well, i'm okay with it, you know? I mean, jeffrey is confident. He is confident that everything is going to take care of itself. Not that he's not ever not confident, but i don't know. Meanwhile, this princess impostor is all over europe, living it up, having the time of her life.", "Reva: And that doesn't bother you? Because it bothers me that she's impersonating you.", "Cassie: It weirds me out. I'm more curious than anything. But don't worry about it. I mean, I'm on it. I am going to track her down. I'm fine.", "Reva: Well, i hope so, because, cassie, she's a thief. She's stolen your name, she's stolen your history. She wants to be you. And the fact that you don't find that disturbing disturbs me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dinah: So you're sleeping with her. Who does she think you are? With that face, you're a dead ringer for her dead richard. She must have thought richard was back from the dead.", "Jeffrey: You're still facing a murder charge in springfield. I think you need to remember that.", "Dinah: Well, thank you for reminding me.", "Jeffrey: And here's something else you need to remember. I gave you your freedom. And I can take it away just as easily. So the princess cassie routine is over. Is that clear? If not, you'll be spending the rest of your life in some hole of a prison, just like the one i yanked you out of. (Chains rattling)", "dinah: Now, if I remember, you and I used to have very good times. Let's dance.", "Jeffrey: You haven't heard a word i've said.", "Dinah: Yes, i have. And you can't fly all the way over here, threaten me and get right back on a plane. No, this is a special event, a special occasion. One dance. We'll stay in the shadows where no one can see us, just like we used to. Come on. I won't bite. Unless you want me to. Coming up on \"guiding light.\"", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ross: Did you conceal evidence to protect your girlfriend?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Absolutely not.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dinah: Why don't we get a nice hotel suite and play, just like we used to?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: Sandy? I need a favor.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sandy: Talk to me. No problem. All right, everybody. I've got a great idea. How about a spotlight dance for the stars of your senior play, romeo and juliet. (Cheers and applause)", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "joey: No, no, no, no, no. I can't do this, man. (Kids groaning) romeo. Romeo. Romeo!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: Stage fright?", "Lizzie: He doesn't want to dance, okay?", "Tammy: It's just one little dance.", "Lizzie: Well, he's not into it!", "Tammy: Come on. I promise I'll let you lead. (Cheers and applause)", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "lizzie: Great.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: Nobody is going to dance with me, huh? Okay. Come on and dance with me yeah, slow skip a beat and move with the body yeah, slow don't want to rush it let the rhythm pull you in this and so touch it oh...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: I think you're blowing this way out of proportion.", "Reva: And i think that you're a little too fascinated by this woman.", "Cassie: I'm not fascinated. I'm just curious. Do you know why this is so interesting to me? Someone has found my identity so appealing that they've opted to use it for themselves.", "Reva: Steal it, cassie. That's the word. \"Steal.\"", "Cassie: Reva, come on. She is crisscrossing around europe meeting influential people and she's using my name as her entree.", "Reva: She could be ruining your name. Have you thought about that?", "Cassie: I haven't got that far. (Laughs)", "reva: I wish you would.", "Cassie: I know that you want to protect me, but jeffrey o'neill said i have nothing to worry about, and he's the professional.", "Reva: You know what? I don't know why jeffrey is downplaying this whole thing because this nonprofessional knows that that woman in europe is a fraud and a criminal, and she's living a lie with your name attached to it.", "Cassie: So am i supposed to be so furious that i call interpol and have them arrest her?", "Reva: Well, you know, that's w most victims would respond, yes.", "Cassie: I don't feel like a victim.", "Reva: And that's exactly what worries me.", "Cassie: Can we just drop this? Can we just... No, we can't. Okay.", "Reva: There's something else going on here.", "Cassie: We should get that massage therapist back because i'm more tense now than I was earlier.", "Reva: You and edmund just moved in here, right?", "Cassie: Yeah. So?", "Reva: Well, as much as i didn't think that that was the wisest decision you could make, I do know that it's something you wanted more than anything else in this world. Him and this farm.", "Cassie: It is, reva. It is.", "Reva: And you're happy living here? Living this life? This life?", "Cassie: Yes, I am. Very happy here. I don't want to do this anymore. (Music playing) (tango music playing)", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "dinah: This doesn't have to stop when the music does. (Tango music playing)", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Darci: Hi.", "Gus: Hey, what, are you passing through?", "Darci: I'm meeting a friend. Gus. You're mad at me, aren't you?", "Gus: Why would I be mad at you?", "Darci: I didn't take your advice.", "Gus: Oh.", "Darci: You asked me-- told me-- not to say anything to frank about my relationship with vinnie or my suspicions of alexandra, but i did it anyway. I'm sorry.", "Gus: That's all right, I'm not mad at you. And you're not sorry. You just did what you felt like you had to do, and i can respect that.", "Darci: I felt like I had no choice, gus. When frank asked me to marry! Him, i just... I couldn't go through with it unless i was absolutely honest with him.", "Gus: Trust is very important.", "Darci: Dishonesty... It's like quicksand after a while. You just...", "Gus: I'd like to think that two people who are in love can actually get through anything.", "Darci: Are we still talking about me and frank?", "Gus: I'm just... I'm being a hopeless romantic, i guess.", "Darci: Oh. Is that it? Maybe there's something you're hiding from harley.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alexandra: Oh, harley, darling.", "Harley: Hi, what's going on? What are you doing here?", "Alexandra: Well, I came down looking for gus-- who isn't around, by the way, in case you're looking for him, too-- but...", "Harley: No. I came to talk to frank.", "Alexandra: Oh, well, as long as you're here, a couple of details...", "Harley: You know what? Can we talk about this tomorrow?", "Alexandra: Well, as long as we're here together, i thought maybe just...", "Harley: You know what? Can we just talk about it tomorrow, because I really, really need to talk to frank.", "Alexandra: Suit yourself. Good night, darling.", "Harley: Awfully busy for this late at night. Who are they?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Frank: Investigators from internal affairs.", "Harley: What are they doing here?", "Frank: Investigating.", "Ross: You got something? Thank you.", "Frank: On ross' order.", "Harley: Ross?", "Frank: Yeah, ross. He got an anonymous phone call yesterday saying that someone in the police department was looking the other way while salerno was bringing in drugs. So he decides to call internal affairs.", "Harley: Ross? I worked this case. Gus was the officer in charge. I think we would know if there was some pd connection to that racket.", "Ross: Frank said the same thing.", "Harley: You're choosing not to believe him?", "Frank: You know what, sis? Just save your breath here. Obviously our new mayor is protecting the good people of springfield.", "Harley: That's okay. It's okay. Let these guys do what they have to. You'll be proven right in the end, anyway.", "Investigator: Chief? We're looking for the brad green phone logs.", "Frank: Yeah, I've got them in my briefcase. Here you go. Ross, there has to be some other way, right?", "Ross: Frank, we've been over this.", "Investigator: Um, this is the wrong file.", "Frank: What?", "Investigator: The wrong file.", "Frank: Just go through my briefcase, okay? I'm sure you'll find it in there. Just dig in there. Ross, please.", "Investigator: Mr. Mayor? I think I've found something. (Music playing)", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "michelle: I need some air. Come with me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Joey: The other day on the farm, I saw you in the garden.", "Tammy: Oh, no. I was probably all muddy with weeds in my hair.", "Joey: No, no, no. You looked great. I wanted to just come over to you and just...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: You okay? I wasn't coming on too strong in there, was i?", "Michelle: I liked it.", "Danny: Good.", "Michelle: That's the only reason why i wanted to come outside, was because i wanted to be alone with you. We're really good when we're together, aren't we? I mean, when we're together.", "Danny: Mm-hmm. Yeah, you could say that. Better than good. Always have been.", "Michelle: I can tell by the way we danced.", "Danny: Yeah?", "Michelle: Yeah. It was hot. This is kind of weird for you?", "Danny: I almost feel like i'm cheating on my wife.", "Shayne: Hey, danny?", "Danny: Yeah?", "Shayne: I think we blew a fuse or something.", "Danny: Oh. Yeah, okay, I'll be right there. I'll be right back. Don't move. I almost feel like i'm cheating on my wife.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: Joey, I miss you so much. I can't stand not being with you, not talking to you about stuff, about nothing. Please don't be mad. I think about you all the time. Do you ever think about me?", "Joey: Yeah. And about how I could never have given you what you needed.", "Tammy: That is not true.", "Joey: Look, tammy, I'm never going to be as smart and as smooth as edmund.", "Tammy: Oh, forget edmund. Look, I was just confused for a while. I know it was wrong, okay, but it's over. It's over. What can i say? I'm not perfect.", "Joey: I'm not, either.", "Tammy: See how much we have in common?", "Joey: (Laughs)", "tammy: Can't we just talk about this and try to figure things out? Please?", "Joey: Yeah. That would be good.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marina: Hey. Have you noticed anything different about shayne lately?", "Sandy: \"Anything.\" Could you be less specific?", "Marina: I mean, like... I don't know, lately it just seems like he's not even here.", "Sandy: He's right over there.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: I bet it's pretty bad. (Laughs)", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "joey: No, it's pretty good. (Laughs)", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "tammy: I heard it was really bad.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Joey: No, it wasn't.", "Tammy: Everyone said so.", "Joey: Well, who's everyone?", "Tammy: It's long. It goes on and on forever.", "Lizzie: (Sobs) joey.", "Joey: Whoa.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: Where did you run off to this time, michelle?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: I'm not keeping anything from harley. I'm just a little... I'm sitting here thinking about what a big step it is to get married, you know?", "Darci: Yeah. Does that scare you?", "Gus: Only... I want it to work out, you know, badly.", "Darci: Yeah, well, of course it will. You and harley love each other.", "Gus: Yeah, but I really want to make her happy, but i don't know if it's really possible to make the other person in the relationship happy. I've got flaws, you know? I've got... I've got a lot of flaws.", "Darci: We all do, gus. We're human. Anyway, I have a sneaking suspicion harley knows this about you already and loves you anyway. Which is great. She knows what she's getting into. Anyway, if anyone should be worried about getting married, it's me.", "Gus: Why? Frank is crazy about you.", "Darci: Yeah, now. But frank's a good guy. I mean, he is genuinely good, gus. What are the chances that someone like me could make him happy for the rest of his life?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ross: Frank? Could we talk in private for a minute?", "Frank: Right here is just fine, ross.", "Ross: Okay. Before we go further, is there anything that you want to tell me?", "Frank: Come on, ross. What is this?", "Ross: I know, along with a lot of other people, that you and darci were recently engaged.", "Harley: What does that have to do with anything?", "Ross: According to this file, darci matthews was intimately involved with brad green and vincent salerno. There are photographs, receipts, supporting statements.", "Frank: Let me see that. I've never seen this before in my life.", "Ross: Frank. It was in your briefcase. I hate to ask this, but I have no choice: Did you conceal evidence to protect your girlfriend.", "Harley: Absolutely not. That's a lie!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: I meant what I said, reva. I love my life here with edmund. I love everything about being here. I just sometimes miss the life that i used to have, that's all.", "Reva: As princess cassie.", "Cassie: Yes.
