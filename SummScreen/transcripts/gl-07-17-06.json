        "Alan arranges for the psychiatrist and two guards to bring Lizzie to the mansion. Jonathan crashes through a window at the mansion to rescue Lizzie as Tammy tells Alan that he will not take Lizzie anywhere. Alan feigns that he is apologizing to Lizzie and hands the keys to the Penthouse where she, Tammy and Jonathan can live. The three go back to Tammy and Jonathan's room, keys in hand. Alan and Beth listen via walkie talkies Tammy, Jonathan and Lizzie's conversation. Josh admits he has feelings for Cassie, but they both decide they must put this behind them and forget this. Both of them look sad and confused. Reva starts the stem cell treatment and Billy calls Josh. Josh tells Billy that Billy is responsible for Reva now. Reva appears uncomfortable during the treatment and looks longingly at a picture of Josh as Billy goes to a bar and motions to the bartender."

        "Tammy: Jonathan, it's okay.",
        "Jonathan: No, I'm starving. And I put in an order of food downstairs, and then I remember, \"Oh, I can't pay for it. Alan Spaulding canceled my credit card.\"",
        "Tammy: Well, we'll get it all settled. And I'll pay for the food. My wallet's inside. I just hope I can find it amongst all of Lizzie's stuff she moved in. Roxy, it's okay. Lizzie? She's gone.",
        "Jonathan: Maybe she went to get food.",
        "Tammy: No, not without Roxy. Something happened to her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Let go! Let go of me! Ugh! This is really nice, Granddad, having me kidnapped? Wonderful! Let me go!",
        "Alan: Call it an intervention, Elizabeth.",
        "Lizzie: Look, I've already made my decision about where I want to live. That is with my friends-- my friends who understand me, my friends who aren't waiting around to get a hold of my baby once it's born.",
        "Alan: Thank you, gentlemen. Doctor?",
        "Lizzie: What?",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, it concerns us that you're starting to sound paranoid.",
        "Dr. Baker: It's a textbook case.",
        "Lizzie: Are you trying to say...?",
        "Beth: Lizzie...",
        "Lizzie: Are you in on this too?",
        "Beth: You need to calm down.",
        "Lizzie: Calm down?",
        "Beth: Yes.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, okay. He had his rent-a-shrink haul me back here, and now they're talking about how crazy I am. This is not about bringing me home, Mom. Where are you sending me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: So that's it, huh? My brand-spanking-new room.",
        "Colin: For a couple of weeks, anyway.",
        "Reva: Talk about no-frills.",
        "Colin: Reva, you have to be in a completely isolated environment once the cytoreductive therapy is completed.",
        "Reva: It's funny, you know, using the word \"therapy\" to describe a procedure that totally wipes out your immune system.",
        "Colin: Think of it as a one-step backwards to take two steps forward approach.",
        "Reva: Now, that's a good explanation, Colin-- direct, simple, clear.",
        "Colin: I came up with it just for you. (Laughs)",
        "Reva: You know, I saw that movie, that Travolta movie, when he was in the bubble. I know how it works. I mean, I know how it's supposed to work. You harvest a bunch of my stem cells...",
        "Colin: Which we've already done.",
        "Reva: ...And then you zap me with chemo and radiation, which destroys the cancer cells...",
        "Colin: As well as the aforementioned immune system, unfortunately.",
        "Reva: Collateral damage. After that, you pump my stem cells back into me, kick-starting my brand-new immune system. How's that?",
        "Colin: Excellent. Simple. Direct. Clear.",
        "Reva: (Laughs)",
        "Colin: You could give a lecture at med school.",
        "Reva: So what's in that bag?",
        "Colin: Oh. Yes, well, as I explained, you can't be exposed to any germs until your immune system has reconstituted itself, so I had this sterilized for you. Billy got it to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You feel the same way?",
        "Josh: I'm not sure it's the same. I... but yes, I have feelings for you, too. Never in a million years did I think I, uh...",
        "Cassie: Josh, I told you how I felt because I couldn't keep it inside anymore, because it was consuming me. It was affecting everything. But I never dreamed... I mean, I sure didn't think you were going to turn around and say...",
        "Josh: I guess... I guess I couldn't hold it inside anymore either.",
        "Cassie: So what do we do now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: No one at the front desk saw Lizzie leave.",
        "Jonathan: Well, she could have gone out through the garage.",
        "Tammy: Why would she have gone anywhere? She was in the middle of unpacking.",
        "Jonathan: Maybe she realized that living with us, she would never have enough closet space.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan, it's not funny. Something definitely happened. I mean, if she was just going to run errands, she wouldn't have left Roxy. She would have left us a note, too.",
        "Jonathan: Maybe she didn't have enough time.",
        "Tammy: Why?",
        "Jonathan: Maybe Alan got to her first.",
        "Tammy: He tried locking her up before.",
        "Jonathan: (Laughs) Tammy, chill out! You can't have a heart attack every time Lizzie decides to go for a walk.",
        "Tammy: I would really like it if I was just overreacting, but I really don't think that I am.",
        "Jonathan: What? Where are you going?",
        "Tammy: To the Spaulding's.",
        "Jonathan: Why?",
        "Tammy: Jonathan, we promised Lizzie that we would be a united front when it comes to taking care of this baby. I'm just keeping my promise.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy! Oh... here we go again. I know. I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: What do we do now? Um... I don't know.",
        "Cassie: Well, I sure don't know.",
        "Josh: Look, we didn't know that we were going to be standing here having this conversation, right? So...",
        "Cassie: Uh, no, we sure didn't.",
        "Josh: So we shouldn't really blame ourselves for not having the answer to the question of what happens next.",
        "Cassie: Right. Yeah. I think I have enough to blame myself for already.",
        "Josh: Cassie, we didn't ask for this. And you said yourself that you were, um... fighting feelings, right? Trying to shove them down like they weren't there?",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Josh: Something like that.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, and that's what you were doing, too?",
        "Josh: Kind of crept up on me. I think I know why, too, I mean... because we were so, um...",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Josh: Connected. And I don't mean this thing right here, I mean that we had a lot of stuff that we had to deal with, and we had to really work as a team, so...",
        "Cassie: Yeah, yeah. There's been a lot of stuff.",
        "Josh: Yeah, we had the veterans' hospital project.",
        "Cassie: And Tammy and Jonathan...",
        "Josh: Yeah, and this latest thing of Reva's, uh, her, uh...",
        "Cassie: Adventure?",
        "Josh: Okay, I'll take that definition.",
        "Cassie: I've got to tell you, Josh, I don't think it's fair, what she's doing.",
        "Josh: Cassie, I...",
        "Cassie: No. I have to say it, because I have to figure out why this could possibly have happened, and I love her, but I saw the look on your face when she first started pulling away from you. It was that \"Here we go again\" look. And you, you deserve to be treated better than that.",
        "Josh: So it started as pity and then turned into something else. (Laughs)",
        "Cassie: God, no. It was never pity. It was never pity. I just respect you enough to care. And, I don't know, maybe the whole Reva thing has something to do with why you would feel something for me, because...",
        "Josh: How so?",
        "Cassie: She's just been away so much lately, and we're sisters, you know? We're alike.",
        "Josh: No, you're not. You're not at all alike. You are your own person, Cassie, utterly unique, loving and compassionate and beautiful. Very strange, you know, to think about the last few weeks, how many times we've probably been in a room together, sitting across a table from each other and say one thing and then feel like you're thinking something entirely different.",
        "Cassie: Uh, yeah.",
        "Josh: It's kind of a relief, isn't it? This is kind of a relief.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Yeah, I'm feeling...",
        "Josh: Because now we can put it behind us. We can move on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Oh, did you start yet?",
        "Colin: Uh, no. Listen, Reva's right over there. Do me a favor, sit with her until we're ready to go?",
        "Billy: Sure, sure. Wait, uh... she going to be okay?",
        "Colin: Well, we're going to do the best we can, but I...",
        "Billy: All right, but you can't make any promises. What a surprise.",
        "Colin: What do you want to hear from me?",
        "Billy: You know what I want to hear from you.",
        "Colin: Yeah. Listen, if we don't get the results we're looking for from the autologous stem cells, we're going to need a bone marrow donor. I want you to put together a list of potential candidates. Family members at best. Siblings, maybe a son or daughter...",
        "Billy: You know, Reva doesn't want the...",
        "Colin: I know what Reva wants! Just put together the list. Okay? Be sure to include phone numbers and contact information. With any luck, we won't need it, but just so we have it.",
        "Billy: Oh, wow! This is a... this place is a maze, it's not a hospital. I had to ask three people how to get here. I got lost!",
        "Reva: I kind of wish I'd gotten lost on my way here, too. Unfortunately, I was with Colin. Thank you for this.",
        "Billy: Oh, my pleasure. So, how you feeling?",
        "Reva: Oh, I don't know, like a rabbit ready to go down the hole. Oh, which reminds me, this stuff I can't take in there with me. The cell phone and any jewelry. So I'd kind of like you to hang on to it for me.",
        "Billy: Sure. I'll tell you, though, I'd rather hang on to you.",
        "Reva: Hey, there's that silver Lewis tongue. I'm going to be fine.",
        "Billy: You know, it's me here. You don't have to be brave if you don't want to be.",
        "Reva: Who needs bravery when I have you and Colin? And a bunch of stem cells in the freezer. Those are going to wipe out all the cancer cells, and then every last one of them, and then we're going to plug in a brand-new immune system with a lifetime guarantee.",
        "Billy: That's the plan.",
        "Reva: Maybe it wouldn't hurt to be a little brave. And I've got the best model right here in front of me.",
        "Billy: Me?",
        "Reva: Yes, you, Billy. You were hit with a deadly disease, too. But your drinking didn't do you in. You stood up and you fought for yourself. And things got better.",
        "Billy: It's a fight every day, day by day.",
        "Reva: Yeah, same here. So heck, yeah, you're my model. If things get a little dicey in there, I'm just going to think of you.",
        "Billy: (Laughs) You'll be in some deep trouble then!",
        "Colin: All right, Reva. It's time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Elizabeth.",
        "Lizzie: You want to send me to that loony bin? You want to get your rubber stamped shrink here to say it's for my own good, but it's all about you. It's always what fits best for you, isn't it, Granddad?",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, please, calm down!",
        "Lizzie: Let me guess! Let me guess, huh? Is the ambulance waiting outside with a straight-jacket in the back?",
        "Beth: Honey, you need to relax.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, you want me to relax while you guys are trying to commit me? I don't think so.",
        "Tammy: You're not sending Lizzie anywhere. I heard everything. You can't get away with this.",
        "Alan: This is a family affair, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: I count as family. Jonathan's the baby's father, and I'm with Jonathan.",
        "Dr. Baker: Lizzie, come with me.",
        "Lizzie: Get away from me, I will knock your teeth out.",
        "Beth: Tammy, why don't you just leave?",
        "Tammy: I'm not going anywhere until I know that Lizzie's safe.",
        "Alan: Enough, everyone! No one's taking Elizabeth anywhere. There is no ambulance, no straight-jacket, and no room at Ravenwood.",
        "Lizzie: Then why did you have me carted back here like some hunting trophy?",
        "Alan: Because I had to do something dramatic, sweetheart, to get your attention, to get alone with you so that... so that I could apologize to you.",
        "Lizzie: Apologize?",
        "Alan: Yes, apologize. Once again, I have been selfish and controlling. Sweetheart, you're a young lady now. You're... you're bringing a new life into this world. Please, please forgive me.",
        "Lizzie: I don't know yet, okay?",
        "Alan: Perhaps this will convince you. Now, I know that you have wanted to move in with your friends. I will not stand in your way.",
        "Lizzie: So you're totally okay with it?",
        "Alan: I'm not thrilled with it, but I want you to be happy. I want us all to be happy. You're bringing in a new life into our family. This should be a happy time for us. This whole thing has gotten out of control.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Sometimes the more you don't talk about something, the bigger it gets. It becomes this monumental thing in your head, and then you start to believe that it's more than it actually is.",
        "Cassie: Right.",
        "Josh: Your imagination sort of cooks away, and then it's, uh...",
        "Cassie: Nuts, and you make yourself crazy, and... we should never have let it get this far.",
        "Josh: But, see, if we had talked about it before, it wouldn't have gotten this far, and that's why this is a good thing, because now it's... out there. It's in perspective, right? I mean, aren't you relieved?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, sure, I'm relieved, but I'm also, uh, I'm still stuck on the feeling guilty part.",
        "Josh: Okay. So we may have had this thing, this feeling, this... we do, we did. But that doesn't mean that it has to ruin our lives, right?",
        "Case: So then what, we just let it go?",
        "Josh: Yeah. We let it go.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, let it go.",
        "Josh: I'm not going to sit around and pretend like I don't care about you. You're still the greatest sister-in-law in the history of time. And you're a good friend to me. You always have been. So the bottom line is, uh... you don't need to throw me on a plane and send me off to find Reva because, Cassie, I really, really don't want to do that, okay?",
        "Cassie: Good, because, quite honestly, I'd rather have you here. I mean... I mean, I can't run the whole project by myself. And who knows, right? Maybe one day, we'll tell Reva all about this, and she will just get a big old laugh.",
        "Josh: Uh...",
        "Cassie: Or not.",
        "Josh: Probably not.",
        "Cassie: Probably not. Right, yeah. So this will just be our private joke.",
        "Josh: Sure. We'll look back on this time one day and think, \"Oh, that's when we went a little bit nuts.\"",
        "Cassie: Right, and then we let it go and we moved on.",
        "Josh: Right.",
        "Cassie: We should probably get back to town.",
        "Josh: I think that's a good idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse: Ready, doctor?",
        "Colin: Oh, you know, I'll do that. Question is are you ready?",
        "Reva: Mm-hmm. So tell me again what's in today's cocktail. I like the poetry of it.",
        "Colin: (Laughs) Melphalan. Thiotepa. Fludarabine. Cyclophosphamide.",
        "Reva: Yum.",
        "Colin: It's good stuff. (Laughs)",
        "Reva: Well, let's go then, before I lose my nerve. Your hands steady?",
        "Colin: Yeah.",
        "Reva: Steady, steady, steady...",

        "Jeffrey: How is she?",
        "Josh: Why do you ask?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you work with her, so it stands to reason you'd know how she's doing, right? Don't worry, I'm not planning on making a play for her or anything like that if that's what you're thinking.",

        "Alan: Do you honestly think that I would kidnap my own flesh and blood and drag her to her own home?",
        "Jonathan: You locked her in her room the other day. Why not lock her in her room again? Or while you're at it, throw her in the mental institution.",

        "Lizzie: What made you change your mind?",
        "Alan: Actually, your mother did. She made it very clear to me that if I kept behaving the way I was, that I was going to lose you and the baby. And Elizabeth, I'm trying.",

        "Lizzie: You're really giving me back the penthouse?",

        "Josh: No, Billy, I won't forget. You can count on me. I won't let you down. In the meantime, is there anything else at all that I can do for you? I mean, probably not, because now you have everything that you've always wanted, right? You have alone time with Reva. Enjoy it. Enjoy looking after her. And I would suggest, too, that you get used to it, because as far as I'm concerned, from here on in... she's your responsibility. Goodbye, Billy.",

        "Lizzie: Thank you for coming after me when you guys thought I needed to be rescued. And even though I didn't... it was still the way coolest thing anybody's ever done for me.",
        "Jonathan: \"Way coolest.\" Go ahead, say it.",
        "Tammy: What?",
        "Jonathan: That me, the maniac that I am, just caused a humungous, ugly scene for absolutely no reason whatsoever.",
        "Tammy: Yeah. You did. And it was way cool!",
        "Jonathan: (Laughs)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Thank you, Doctor. Beth, you look confused.",
        "Beth: I am. You really did have Dr. Baker bring Lizzie here against her will so you could call a truce?",
        "Alan: That is right.",
        "Beth: What am I missing?",
        "Alan: You know me so well, Beth. Tell me, do you know the story of the Trojan horse? Consider this the updated version.",
        "Tammy: You really hate Alan, don't you?",
        "Jonathan: I hate what he does. That count?",
        "Tammy: Don't be surprised if the next thing he does is send you a big bill for that window you Tarzaned through.",
        "Jonathan: Well, I'll just put it on my credit card. I'd be glad to pay for the window and anything else if Alan would just get out of our lives for good.",
        "Tammy: You don't think it's going to be that easy, huh?",
        "Jonathan: Uh-uh.",
        "Tammy: Can't you at least try to look at the bright side?",
        "Jonathan: Remind me what that is again?",
        "Tammy: Alan's backed off?",
        "Jonathan: We'll see.",
        "Tammy: Hey, we can do this.",
        "Jonathan: I know we can, but can Lizzie? I mean, I know she has a baby growing inside of her now, but that doesn't mean that she's any less of a fruitcake than she was before she got pregnant.",
        "Tammy: Nice talk from the dad-to-be.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, I never claimed to be super-dad material. I don't care about this kid. All I care about is you.",
        "Tammy: We'll see. Let's hear what you have to say about that in a few months.",
        "Jonathan: (Laughs) You love messing with me, don't you?",
        "Tammy: Yup.",

        "Jeffrey: This city needs a mayor who isn't afraid. Afraid to dream new dreams, to imagine Springfield as it could be, as it should be, and as it will be with the right person leading the way. Now, I believe that I am that person, because I can take us forward without ever losing track... without ever losing track of where we've been. (Music) [singer] Why should we worry no one will care, girl look at the stars so far away we've got tonight who needs tomorrow? We've got tonight why don't you stay?",

        "Next, on \"Guiding Light\"...",
        "Jonathan: I don't know how much more I can take. I hate this little girl and her ugly little dog.",
        "Alan: Listen, Elizabeth. These are your best friends.",
        "Jeffrey: I'd offer you a button, but I think you're in my competitor's camp.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, actually, I'm undecided.",
