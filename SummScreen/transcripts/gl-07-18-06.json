        "Tammy takes Lizzie for an outing. Alan finds Lizzie and tells her that he hopes Jonathan doesn't consider her an albatross ruining her life. Lizzie asks Tammy about Jonathan and Tammy tells her that Jonathan will come around. Reva has the chemo and afterwards, phones Jonathan and asks him to be with Josh today (it is their anniversary). Cassie goes to Jeffrey's room and they kiss. Josh sees her as she leaves Jeffrey's room and looks bothered. Alan continues to eavesdrop on Tammy, Jonathan and Lizzie's conversations. Billy, who dodged a bullet at the bar by not drinking, goes to be with Reva. Colin tells Billy that he needs to get a bone marrow donor list for Reva. Reva tells Billy to remember not to tell anyone about her illness. Billy finally makes the decision to call the family. As he watches Reva through her hospital window he says, \"Sorry darlin'. This is a no brainer. I will do what it takes to save your life\"."

        "Jonathan: Lizzie, your dog's going to have a date with Lou's cage! Ugh.",
        "Lizzie: Gosh, she was only playing. Come here, honey.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah? Take her to play somewhere else, like on the freeway. Hey dog, you drool on my stuff again, I'm going to rip off your ears.",
        "Tammy: He's kidding.",
        "Lizzie: Well, good. You're scaring her.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, well, then take her somewhere else. Take her for a walk. Take her for a walk on the freeway.",
        "Lizzie: I don't want to go outside, okay? What if granddad grabs me again? I don't want to take that risk.",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie, you have to get out of this room, okay? You have to show Alan that you're not afraid.",
        "Tammy: Well, you know what they say. When the going gets tough, the tough...",
        "Lizzie: Go shopping. We can hit Main Street and then get lunch, my treat?",
        "Tammy: Yep.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. I will go get dressed.",
        "Jonathan: Hey. I suggested that she leave so you and I could have some time alone. I don't know how much more I can take. I hate this little girl and her ugly little dog.",
        "Tammy: Shh! You're going to make Lizzie feel bad.",
        "Jonathan: So what? What, what will she do, will she leave? You promise?",
        "Tammy: Okay, we all said we would do this. It's not going to be forever.",
        "Jonathan: No, it won't, but it'll feel like it. Trust me.",
        "Alan: Listen, Elizabeth. These are your best friends.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: And remember, I'm counting on all of you on election day. And remember that one vote can make a difference, and so can one man. Thank you very much.",
        "Cassie: Hey, you. I liked your speech.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I'd offer you a button, but I think you're in my competitor's camp.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, actually, I'm undecided. (Cell phone rings)",
        "Jeffrey: Tough choice?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Tough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colin: Well, you handled the chemo like a champ. The next step is to get those stem cells in you and regenerate your immune system. Did you get all that, or am I boring you to sleep?",
        "Reva: Mm...",
        "Colin: Good answer.",
        "Reva: Joshua? Are you here? I can't see you.",
        "Josh: I'm right here. All right, guys. Hey, Sasquatch, you're blocking the sunlight.",
        "Tammy: Oh, nothing could block the sunlight the day I got this one to go to church.",
        "Billy: And you'll get him to get again when he has another one of these to christen. (Laughter)",
        "Cassie: Okay, everybody, say \"Cheese!\"",
        "All: Cheese. (Camera snaps)",
        "Cassie: Okay, so what do you think?",
        "Josh: I'll tell you what I think. I think this has been a wonderful day. That was a beautiful, beautiful christening. And it's Thanksgiving Day and we're all together. Except for...",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. I wish Reva could have been here. She would have been nuts about this kid.",
        "Lizzie: Just as nutty as her son.",
        "Cassie: If only we'd known sooner. We could have had more time with her.",
        "Billy: She didn't want it that way. She didn't want to be a burden.",
        "Jonathan: Well, you come here, little Reva...",
        "Lizzie: (Laughs)",
        "Jonathan: Who's a little baby?",
        "Reva: Billy? Billy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bartender: You look like you could use something strong.",
        "Billy: Uh, yeah, strong would be good right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(cell phone ringing)",
        "Jeffrey: You going to get that?",
        "Cassie: Um...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Come on, Cassie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: No. Where were we?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you were going to tell me how I could help sway your vote. You know where I stand.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I think you've made yourself pretty clear.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you haven't. Are you saying... what, that you've had a chance of heart?",
        "Reporter: Mr. O'Neill? We'd like to get a couple more shots just to make sure we're covered.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm sorry. Can I buy you a cup of coffee?",
        "Cassie: No. You can... you can buy me a drink.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: We need to talk.",
        "Josh: I don't think so, Alan.",
        "Alan: It's in your best interest, Josh, to listen to me.",
        "Josh: Is this about Lizzie's baby, again?",
        "Alan: No, as a matter of fact, it's about the veterans' facility that you're building. I'm thinking about making a sizable contribution. I'm very impressed at your efforts on behalf of our country.",
        "Josh: Well, thank you so much, Alan. But see, I don't really need your approval, and I certainly don't need your money, so...",
        "Alan: You always need money. I've been doing a little research myself. And I've discovered that nine of the 12 large contributors that you have are good golf buddies of mine. Now, what would happen if they suddenly pulled out and you had to start over from scratch?",
        "Josh: You are such a pig, Alan. First you're talking to me about making a contribution, now you're talking about sabotage. You've got to make up your mind, big guy.",
        "Alan: Okay, forget the project, forget the money. Let's talk about the baby that Jonathan and Elizabeth are going to have, the baby that's going to change all of our lives. I think it's time for you to stop waffling and figure out which side you're on, Josh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bartender: Bourbon on the rocks.",
        "Billy: Ooh. You know, what's often overlooked is the wonderful cool feeling of the sweat of condensation on the warm hand. I didn't know Minnesota got this warm.",
        "Bartender: Yeah. You have a relative at the clinic next door?",
        "Billy: Yeah, yeah. Breast cancer.",
        "Bartender: That's tough. Your wife?",
        "Billy: Well, she used to be. I guess I'm all she's got now, though.",
        "Bartender: Well, I guess she's lucky you're still in her life.",
        "Billy: I'm not really a person for responsibility. I mean, it's my little brother, he's the one who, his whole life he's been responsible. Takes to it naturally. Me? I have enough trouble just taking care of myself. I mean, responsibility? That's another guy.",
        "Reva: Hey. Are you clean? Because if it's your germs that kill me, I'm going to sue.",
        "Colin: You're going to sue me after I kill you? That should be interesting. (Laughs)",
        "Reva: Then I'll haunt you. I will. Chains, moans, the whole deal.",
        "Colin: Don't worry, I'm sterile. I mean...",
        "Reva: Where's Billy?",
        "Colin: I haven't seen him for a while. How are you feeling?",
        "Reva: Fantastic, like I could run a few...",
        "Colin: Yeah, well, your vital signs were excellent.",
        "Reva: ...Laps, track...",
        "Colin: You were muttering during your sleep, but it did seem to be about any pain you were experiencing.",
        "Reva: I was dreaming. About Josh. I couldn't find him, and then when I did see him, he looked right through me. He was at a family celebration. They were christening my grandchild. Jonathan named the baby after me.",
        "Colin: Sounds like a nice dream.",
        "Reva: He named it after me because I was dead. Cassie was there taking a family photograph. Reminded them all that I was missing.",
        "Colin: Well, I'm not much into psychology, but that one's pretty easy to analyze: Guilt.",
        "Reva: Or a premonition.",
        "Colin: Let me ask you a question. In this dream, did your family regret that you didn't tell them?",
        "Reva: Yes.",
        "Colin: That's your subconscious, Reva, telling you what I've been telling you all along. Your family deserves to know what's going on.",
        "Reva: My family deserves to live. Unburdened. That's the best gift that I can give them. What would they do, be here wasting time when there's nothing they can do anyway? This is just me feeling helpless, and I hate that.",
        "Colin: You're about the least helpless patient I've ever had. I wish you were more helpless. That way I could call the shots sometimes. See you later.",
        "Reva: Well, there is one thing I can do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Listen to me, dog, okay? Sit, sit. Sit. Okay, good. I don't want a baby any more than you do, okay? You want to share Lizzie's love with a crying, smelling monster? (Cell phone rings) Hello?",
        "Reva: Hi, honey. It's me. I need your help.",
        "Jonathan: Reva, what the hell is going on?",
        "Reva: It's nice to hear your voice, too.",
        "Jonathan: Are you okay?",
        "Reva: I'm on the ropes, but I need you to do something for me. I need a favor. Find Josh, and spend the day with him.",
        "Jonathan: What? What, today? Reva, I'm busy. There's a lot going on here.",
        "Reva: Jonathan, damn it. This is important to me. Just do this, find him, would you please?",
        "Jonathan: Why?",
        "Reva: I need you to do this because I'm not there, okay? I need to know that you're both okay, that you're together-- today.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, are you sure that everything's okay?",
        "Reva: You hear the music? I'm having a party.",
        "Jonathan: Long as you're not dancing with the grim reaper.",
        "Reva: No, I'm not his type. Now, will you find Josh?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Okay.",
        "Reva: Thanks. I love you. (Sighs)",
        "Jonathan: Love you, too.",
        "Reva: Happy Anniversary, Bud. Always.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I still can't believe that this is happening to me. I mean, one stupid night, one time and I got pregnant. Look, about Jonathan and that night. I was drunk, okay? I don't even remember it. I mean, like, I do, but I don't, you know?",
        "Tammy: Let's not do this, okay?",
        "Lizzie: Okay, I'm sorry.",
        "Tammy: I just like to think of this as an immaculate conception. That way I don't have to think about you and Jonathan.",
        "Lizzie: Gotcha. You really are a good person, Tammy. You and Jonathan are the last people... just the last people I ever thought would come through for me.",
        "Tammy: I don't know who's going to do what for the baby, but I guess we'll find out after she's born, huh?",
        "Lizzie: I just hope I get my body back. I miss being noticed.",
        "Tammy: You can still be noticed. Yeah.",
        "Lizzie: I used to brush guys like that off all the time. And now they will never give me the time of day.",
        "Tammy: Oh, yeah? Uh, excuse me. My friend would like to know what time it is.",
        "Guy: Little after one. Need the date, too?",
        "Lizzie: Well, I guess that depends on how much it's going to cost me.",
        "Guy: I'm Nick.",
        "Lizzie: Lizzie. And this is Tammy. Do you live around here?",
        "Guy: Yeah, just moved to town.",
        "Lizzie: Really? Do you like it?",
        "Guy: I love it. The women are hot, really in shape. And it's a nice change from the girls back home in the all-you-can-eat buffet line.",
        "Lizzie: Oh. Really. No, I'm not pregnant. I just like ice cream.",
        "Guy: You know what, I'm late for an appointment, but it was nice to meet you.",
        "Lizzie: Mm-hmm. Bye-bye. Buffets rule!",
        "Tammy: See, you still got it going on.",
        "Lizzie: Oh yeah, we do! (Laughs)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: So, here we are. Uh, you wanted a drink.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, you know what, though, I think it's a little early. How about sparkling water?",
        "Jeffrey: Okay.",
        "Cassie: So, how's the campaign going?",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, well, you know, some days I feel like I'm winning, and some days I feel like...",
        "Cassie: Stop torturing me and go back to...",
        "Josh: Torturing you?",
        "Cassie: Yes, torturing me!",
        "Josh: How am I torturing you?",
        "Cassie: You are constantly torturing me. I have feelings for you, Josh!",
        "Jeffrey: You know, it's not that I don't think that Blake is a good candidate, it's just that, well, after her loss, you know, and Ross...",
        "Cassie: I'm sorry. Would you just repeat that last part again?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I could, but I don't think you're here to talk about my campaign or the weather, or anything else for that matter. No, you want something. Or you're running from something. Which is it?",
        "Cassie: It's neither, I... I just think we should share a drink, you know? And talk about old times.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, they aren't that old.",
        "Cassie: No, they're not. Sometimes they don't feel that long ago at all.",
        "Jeffrey: Careful, careful, whoa.",
        "Cassie: Oh, sorry.",
        "Jeffrey: Got it?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I do. Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: You don't even like Jonathan. You threw him down the stairs.",
        "Josh: Could I get a cup of coffee, please?",
        "Alan: What if this were Marah? What if she was with a guy like Jonathan? You wouldn't like that. Now, I'm only trying to protect my family, Josh, and I think you can understand that.",
        "Josh: I do, Alan. See, Jonathan is my family. Tammy is my family. I am trying to protect my family from you.",
        "Alan: You need to stop using Jonathan to shore up your broken marriage. And you need to start using your head. Ask yourself: What would Cassie want me to do?",
        "Josh: What would Cassie want me to do?",
        "Alan: Yes. She hates the man. Do you think she will like you defending him? For God's sake, Josh, make her happy and get something out of this for yourself.",
        "Josh: What the hell are you talking about?",
        "Alan: I saw you two with my own eyes dancing in the park. You were all over each other. Now, no wonder Reva left town. Her son and his cousin are a couple. You and her sister?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colin: Ready for your stem cell chaser?",
        "Reva: On the rocks with a slice of lime.",
        "Colin: This will be a breeze. We'll administer the transplant through your main line, much like a blood transfusion.",
        "Reva: Sounds great.",
        "Colin: And after we're finished, I'll be monitoring you very closely. You'll be getting more platelets as well as a massive dose of antibiotics.",
        "Reva: I can't wait.",
        "Colin: You ready to get to work?",
        "Reva: Bring it on, baby.",
        "Colin: I like that attitude. It's going to serve you well in the upcoming days. Visualization.",
        "Reva: Every time I try to imagine those stem cells, I see your face on every one of them. Why do you think that is?",
        "Colin: Well, that's because we've been spending way too much time together.",
        "Reva: Well, then it's a good thing there's another doctor here.",
        "Billy: How is the patient today?",
        "Reva: Why, Dr. Lewis!",
        "Billy: (Fake accent) Mrs. Lewis! You have any aches or pains in ze butt you want me to take care of? (Laughs)",
        "Reva: No. I've got everything I need now. Thought maybe you might have changed your mind about being here.",
        "Billy: Oh, sweetie. I would never let you fight this fight alone. I'm here, and I'm going to stay.",

        "Gina Tognoni, \"Inside The Light.\" My favorite Dinah moment is... it was when on a long trip in the farmhouse she was kidnapped. And she was held against her will, and Edmund was keeping her there. And at the very end, she looked at herself in the mirror and she said, \"You know, it's time to take some action.\" And she pulled herself up, and she did that through a monologue into the mirror. And that was one of my favorite moments. It was like she pulled herself up by the bootstraps. See Dinah, Wednesday, July 19, \"Inside The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Cassie is my sister-in- law. (Scoffs) I don't know what it is you think you saw...",
        "Alan: I saw it right in front of my eyes.",
        "Josh: Yeah, people dance with their relatives all the time.",
        "Alan: Yes. I danced with Beth on several occasions, my daughter-in-law, and then...",
        "Josh: There you go.",
        "Alan: ...I married her. Now, Cassie's very attractive, and much less complicated than Reva.",
        "Josh: You might want to think about leaving right now.",
        "Alan: Guess I hit a nerve.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Uh, what... what's going on? You know, when you walked away, I did, too, and... not that I'm complaining. I'm so glad you're here, and I don't want to spoil the moment with questions, but...",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I... I just... I've been doing a lot of thinking lately, a whole lot of thinking about some of the things I said to you after I found out that you impersonated Richard. And I'm not excusing what you did, but I've come to realize that the line between black and white can sometimes get very blurry when your heart takes over. And you find yourself wanting someone that you have absolutely no business wanting. And it's just taken me this time to find that out.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I'm not sure what we're doing here, either. I did love you. And I still care for you. I hated myself for so long after what I did to you. But it sounds like you're telling me you forgive me?",
        "Cassie: (Sighs) Yeah, I... I suppose I do.",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie. Are you saying that you want to try again?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Look, what goes on between you and Cassie is none of my business. I just want us to come to an understanding about Jonathan.",
        "Josh: Go away, Alan.",
        "Jonathan: You guys need a ref?",
        "Josh: No, we don't need a ref. In fact, Alan was just leaving, weren't you?",
        "Alan: Oh, hello, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Well, hey, pal! How you doing?",
        "Alan: Tell me, how is Elizabeth these day?",
        "Jonathan: Ooh, she's peachy.",
        "Alan: Yeah?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah.",
        "Alan: Have you moved your stuff into the apartment yet?",
        "Jonathan: Mm-mm.",
        "Alan: Well, if you need any help, call on me.",
        "Jonathan: (Laughs)",
        "Alan: Because after all, we are family.",
        "Jonathan: (Laughs) You betcha. You betcha. So was that confrontation all about me, huh?",
        "Josh: It certainly started that way.",
        "Jonathan: I'm sorry that he put you in the middle of my mess.",
        "Josh: You know what, I'm not really worried about Alan Spaulding, Jonathan. So, what brings you here? You sniffing around for a little snack?",
        "Jonathan: No, actually, I was looking for you. I went by your work and they said you would be here, so...",
        "Josh: Oh, I see. So you were tracking me down. What's that about?",
        "Jonathan: Reva sent me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Where have you been, Billy Lewis? Did you meet a girl?",
        "Billy: Oh, darling, you're more than enough girl for me.",
        "Reva: Then where?",
        "Billy: Well, I think the important thing is that I didn't stay, and I'm here now. Got myself all cleaned up and I smell real pretty and I don't have any breath mints. Ain't I every mother's dream?",
        "Reva: All I know is you're certainly mine.",
        "Billy: That's good to know.",
        "Colin: All right. Ready to begin?",
        "Billy: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't get scared. Just look right at me. We're going to take this trip together, and I'm going to drive, and I'm sober this time so I'll make all the curves and I'll dodge the cars, and we're going to be safe all the way back home.",
        "Reva: You wouldn't lie to me, would you, Billy?",
        "Billy: No, ma'am.",
        "Reva: You really believe?",
        "Billy: With all my heart.",
        "Reva: Okay then, young Frankenstein, let her rip!",
        "Billy: (Chuckles)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: So what's it feel like having the baby in there? Is it cool?",
        "Lizzie: Mm, cool. It depends on whether you think that swollen feet and gas are cool.",
        "Tammy: Mm, actually, I do.",
        "Lizzie: (Laughs) No, seriously, I don't know, when she kicks or when she moves around... kind of reminds me that there's a real person in there.",
        "Tammy: What about the delivery? You excited for that?",
        "Lizzie: Freaked out! Baby, size of watermelon. Hello. I'm not. And in movies, like, the women in labor are like... (screams) Too much hot sauce. Sorry.",
        "Tammy: Good call. Good call. It'll be okay, giving birth, I mean. From what I hear, once you have the baby in your arms you don't even remember the pain.",
        "Lizzie: You'll still be my birthing coach?",
        "Tammy: I'll be there if you want me.",
        "Lizzie: I need you.",
        "Tammy: Nah. You're one of the strongest people I know. You kicked leukemia. After that, having a baby will be easy.",
        "Alan: Well, hello, ladies. What a surprise.",
        "Tammy: Alan, you have a lot of money. Couldn't you have just hired someone to follow us?",
        "Alan: Tammy, I'm a hands-on kind of guy.",
        "Lizzie: Leave me alone, Granddad. I just want to be with my friends. You said that I could. A deal's a deal, right?",
        "Alan: I know, sweetheart. I just wanted to drop by and say hello, that's all. And tell you I miss you.",
        "Tammy: That's so sweet.",
        "Alan: I know you don't trust me a lot these days and I've made a lot of mistakes, but I hope that my generous gift of the penthouse is a step in the right direction.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, it was. Thanks.",
        "Alan: You know, your baby and you are really all that I care about, Elizabeth. Tell me, how is Jonathan treating you these days?",
        "Lizzie: Fine.",
        "Alan: Well, glad to hear that. I feel that if he spends a little more time with you, he'll not feel that you're an albatross ruining his life. Well, ladies, if you will excuse me, I will leave. Have a nice day.",
        "Lizzie: Tammy, does Jonathan...",
        "Tammy: You know how he is he's just cranky sometimes.",
        "Lizzie: I just don't want to be where I'm not wanted.",
        "Tammy: No, I want you there. And Jonathan will come around. Once we're in the penthouse, things will be different.",
        "Lizzie: Or not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Reva sent you to find me?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Something about me and you spending together when she's not around? Who knows what her reasons are for anything, right?",
        "Josh: Maybe... maybe she wanted me to talk to you about becoming a father.",
        "Jonathan: No, she didn't mention that.",
        "Josh: Well, she knew that if she did, you wouldn't follow through, right?",
        "Jonathan: Probably. All right. We don't have to do this if it...",
        "Josh: No, you know what, stay. Please. Whatever's going on with her right now, and other members of this family, we are still a family, and I fully intend to hold that together. So, let me buy you lunch.",
        "Jonathan: Can we skip the daddy talk?",
        "Josh: In fact, I'll throw in a couple of beers. Could we have two beers, please? Couple of menus? Thank you. Appreciate that. Okay, Jonathan, my guess is that you are concerned about the idea of becoming a father, is that right?",
        "Jonathan: Something like that.",
        "Josh: Okay, well, I was once, too. I don't know if you know this, but your mom and I, we weren't married when she got pregnant with Marah. Our lives were crazy, what a surprise, and things were a little bit complicated at the time.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, but you guys worked it out and you got married.",
        "Josh: Eventually, sure. In fact, today is the anniversary of our first marriage at Cross Creek. I have always loved your mother, Jonathan. There has never been anyone else for me. But the fact is, I don't know that anyone is ever ready to be a father. I mean, I really was scared to death at the time. I wondered if I would be good enough and fair enough, patient enough.",
        "Jonathan: I mean, if that's what was going through your head, imagine what I'm thinking.",
        "Waitress: Hey, guys.",
        "Josh: Thank you.",
        "Waitress: You're welcome.",
        "Jonathan: Thanks. Look, I'm not trying to get father of the year award here. I'm only doing this because Reva and Tammy wouldn't let up on me.",
        "Josh: You won't regret it. I can't really imagine my life without Marah and Shayne in it, and I don't even like to think about that.",
        "Jonathan: I get that. I get that, but that's not me. And I'm not you.",
        "Josh: Okay. Let's talk about a week or so after you've seen your baby's face and held her in your arms for the first time. Because there really is nothing better than that. You become a part of something that's so much bigger than yourself. A family. And until you have it, you don't realize really what you missed out on.",

        "Colin: Think good, strong thoughts, huh?",
        "Reva: All those little Colin's fighting the good fight.",
        "Billy: Hey, you rest now, okay? I'm going to be right here when you wake up.",
        "Colin: About the bone marrow donor, have you contacted any of Reva's family? I know Reva doesn't want anyone to know, but if that doesn't work out, Billy, we're going to need a donor, and fast.",
        "Billy: Well, I'll do whatever it takes to get Reva through this.",
        "Colin: Contact as many family members as you can, and get back to me.",
        "Billy: Will do.",
        "Reva: Don't even think about it, Billy.",

        "Cassie: I... I don't know. I didn't plan any of this. I just ran into you and was caught off guard and had feelings. I honestly don't know what to make of these feelings.",
        "Jeffrey: (Laughs) I don't know what to say. I mean, I know we can never go back and try to recapture what we had. I'm just... I'm so glad that you're here and that I'm looking at you now.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Jeffrey: You know what this weekend I have a couple of events I have to attend to out of town. But it's not going to take up all my time, so, I don't know, maybe you want to come? We can, you know, see where this leads.",
        "Cassie: Let me think about that, okay?",
        "Jeffrey: Okay.",
        "Cassie: I... I think for now I should probably get going home.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, okay, sure.",
        "Cassie: Thanks.",
        "Jeffrey: Um, it was so great to see you.",

        "Jonathan: Uh, we'll let you know.",
        "Lizzie: Whoa. Did everyone take a nice pill today?",
        "Jonathan: Everyone?",
        "Tammy: We ran into Alan. He's being kind of friendly, it was weird.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I ran into him, too, and I insulted him and he basically, like, welcomed me to the family.",
        "Lizzie: Great. The only thing scarier than my granddad being nasty is my granddad being nice.",
        "Tammy: You worried?",
        "Lizzie: I just want him out of my life right now. I want him gone. I don't care if he's family, I don't care how much he wants to be a part of this baby's life. He's toxic. I don't need him, and neither does my baby.",
        "Alan: We'll see who you need.",

        "Josh: I was about the, you know, the project.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Well, is it something that can wait? Because I need to go pick up R.J. from camp. I mean, if everything's all right.",
        "Josh: Yeah.",

        "Reva: What were you and Colin talking about, Billy? What were you talking about contacting my relatives? What is it he's not telling me?",
        "Billy: No, no, no, you're fine. Everything's okay. I just... you know, he was doing his doctor thing, and he... he'd given up on you, so he started to hammer on me.",
        "Reva: Then why did you agree to call everybody?",
        "Billy: Just to get him off my back? Hey, he wants to get more people involved. I'm telling him I'm enough, we're going back and forth. Don't worry about this...",
        "Reva: You know how I feel, Billy.",
        "Billy: Darling, written in stone: \"Don't contact anyone.\" Okay, now. What do you want me to put on the jukebox over here?",
        "Reva: No. I want you to get out of here, I do. I don't want to watch you fall asleep in a chair. I want you to go back to the cottage. I want you to take a ride out on that lake.",

        "Colin: Reva's a fighter. But I still need a list of potential bone marrow donors. Now, I respect the fact that Reva doesn't want to be a burden to her family, but the simple fact of the matter is family members are the best candidates.",
        "Billy: Okay...",
        "Colin: So will you make these phone calls?",
        "Billy: Supposing this stem cell thing works. Now, why do anything if it isn't necessary?",
        "Colin: Because if it is necessary, every day will count.",
