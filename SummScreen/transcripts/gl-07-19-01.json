        "Reva: And it seems I lost a \r\nbracelet, and I believe I might have left it in here when your boss was giving \r\nme a tour of the offices. I know I sat on a couch, I believe, over there, and \r\nthis chair. ",

        "Reva: Check on the chair. \r\nIt's a silver bangle bracelet that has my name in Braille on it. My kids gave it \r\nto me.",

        "\r\nCassie: Just started. The first step was to freeze all of Edmund's assets, and \r\nnow we're going over every transaction with a fine-tooth comb, so if there are \r\nany deals under the table, we're going to find them.",
        "\r\nRichard: We do understand that some people may have been forced into an \r\nuntenable situation by Edmund.",

        "\r\nFrank: Okay, fine. Then these are the ground rules. There's no swearing, no \r\nyelling, no insults. The whole point of all of us being here right now is to get \r\neverything out in the open; as a matter of fact, to be as brutally honest and \r\nopen as possible. Now, who wants to go first?",

        "\r\nPhillip: Right. (Snaps fingers) and it should be just like this, right? \r\nOvernight? Within 24 hours after finding this out, I shouldn't be angry that my \r\nbest friend slept with my wife...",

        "\r\nLucas: Well, not at first, but they got pretty loud when they started to argue. \r\nCarmen Santos thought that her son was being disloyal to the family and she \r\nblamed Michelle Santos.

        "\r\nLucas: I've been framed.",
        "\r\nRoss: Three times? (Crowd murmuring) Mr. Carmichael, you were convicted in \r\n1985 for armed robbery. You were convicted in 1989 for deadly assault, and \r\nyou're currently charged with a homicide of a bookie who\r\napparently didn't live up to your high standards. Were you offered a plea \r\nbargain in exchange for your testimony? Mr. Carmichael?",

A weakened Michelle Bauer left the hospital, alone in the middle of \r\nthe night to meet the following person-- a pathologically jealous, possible \r\ninsane and armed mother-in-law, who once set Michelle up for murder and had \r\nthreatened to kill her on more than one occasion. Mr. Carmichael, at the risk of \r\nperjury, are you telling me and this good court that you're standing by this \r\nstory?",

She terrorized Michelle, stalked her, \r\nconstantly threatened her, framed her for a murder that she herself had \r\ncommitted. When the truth finally came out and my mother was charged, she agreed \r\nto turn state's evidence. The night before she was to go into the witness \r\nprotection program, my mother was shot and killed by an unknown gunman in front \r\nof my wife. The whole thing took an enormous toll on my wife and me. Michelle \r\nmiscarried our first child. It was a very difficult time for us. We divorced. A \r\nfew months later, when I learned that Michelle was pregnant with our son, I \r\nasked her for another chance. We thought that since my mother was dead, we \r\nbelieved we'd be able to move on. We decided that we would start over together \r\nand make a fresh start away from here, away from Springfield. The night of \r\nNovember 14, I went to the hospital with airline tickets and passports. I signed \r\nMichelle out of her room and when I had returned, she was gone. She disappeared. \r\nAnd her mother, Claire Ramsey, was hysterical.

        "\r\nRoss: The only way for what, that nobody would get hurt?",

        "\r\nRoss: But it didn't.",
        "\r\nDanny: No. She turned on Michelle again with her gun. She was going to shoot, so \r\nI diverted my mother's attention by pulling out my gun. My mother was insane.",

        "\r\nDanny: Yes, she thought that I was my father. She thought that Michelle was \r\nsomeone that my father had had an affair with. She was delusional. I begged for \r\nmy wife's life and my child's life. But my mother didn't respond to that either. \r\nI... She turned on Michelle again. I ran between my mother and Michelle to try \r\nto protect Michelle and my baby. My mother cocked her gun. And I shot her. After \r\nI made sure that my wife wasn't harmed, I threw my gun into the water and I put \r\nmy mother's body into the lake.",
        "\r\nRoss: You threw the gun into the water? Now, if that gun is in the lake, how in \r\nthe world did the prosecution ballistically prove that another gun was the \r\nweapon?",

        "\r\nRoss: Ladies and gentlemen, defense of life-- yours or another's-- is not a \r\ncrime in this country. Danny Santos was defending life. He was protecting his \r\nunborn child and the mother of that child. Now, you may ask if he was blameless, \r\nwhy didn't he call the police? Why did he hide the body? Why did he keep quiet \r\nfor so long? Well, I propose to you that Carmen and Miguel Santos for years on \r\nend forged a dysfunctional family where only obedience to this twisted family \r\ncode would bring the attention and affection that a child needs. Now, when Danny \r\nSantos fell in love with Michelle Bauer, he found, for the first time, \r\nunconditional and true love and Carmen knew it and was jealous of it. And on the \r\ndock that night, Danny was to make a choice: To go forward with love or to \r\ncontinue with evil. And now it is your turn to make a decision about whether \r\nDanny should be punished for that-- for choosing love over evil.",
