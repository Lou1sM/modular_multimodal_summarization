        "Dinah and Mallet argue about taste in food, movies and music. They make up as fast as the fights start. Dinah gets Harley to go with her to a crazed half- price sale of wedding gowns. In the hustle and bustle of the venue, a woman grabs Dinah's dream dress. Dinah finds out that she is allergic to all types of live flowers and cannot make a decision on the floral arrangements. She gets into a fight with the baker because Ross Marlar had at one time sent the baker's mother to prison. Dinah smashes pastries in his face. At the police station, Blake arrives and tells her that she got the charges dropped. Dinah runs into the woman who grabbed her wedding dress and is able to get the dress back. As Dinah looks at herself in the mirror and envisioning her wedding, Mallet finds an online blog, the \"Springfield Burns\". The headlines read: \"Which Spaulding Executive isn't just shopping for a wedding gown \u0096 but for her boss' husband? What else are they hiding?\" He then finds pictures of Dinah and Gus on a bed, kissing."

        "Dinah: Men! What would they do without us? What would I do without you? I still can't believe you're going to be my husband. Gosh, husband! That's a weird word if you say it over and over. Husband, husband, husband, husband. Has-been, has-been, has-been. Has-been? Wait, how can he be a has-been? We're not even married yet. Oh, it feels like a jigsaw puzzle, but it's real. You and me, baby. Detective A.C. Mallet, we are perfect together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Oh, that was awesome! That was fantastic.",
        "Dinah: Horrible. What are you talking about? A guy cannot slide down the side of a building on a dictionary!",
        "Mallet: Are you kidding me? He just did it. Didn't you see it?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I saw it, and it was stupid.",
        "Mallet: That was stupid? It was so cool!",
        "Dinah: It was stupid, a waste of money.",
        "Mallet: That's a waste of money?",
        "Dinah: Yeah.",
        "Mallet: It had surprises in it. All these chick flicks you take me to, honey, they're all the same. Cute couple meets, they break up...",
        "Dinah: Relationships. That's what it means. Relationships are the most important thing in life. That's why all the great movies-- about relationships.",
        "Mallet: Can I tell you one thing, why I go to the movies?",
        "Dinah: Go ahead, yeah.",
        "Mallet: I go to the movies to escape life, okay?",
        "Dinah: Okay, I go to the bar, okay, not to that movie.",
        "Mallet: That was worth every...",
        "Dinah: Not perfect-perfect. I mean, we fight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Dance music playing)",
        "Dinah: (humming along) Whoo! (Classic rock playing)",
        "Mallet: Ah, classic rock!",
        "Dinah: Are you nuts? Dance music, baby! (Dance music resumes) (classic rock resumes)",
        "Mallet: Classic rock! (Dance music continues)",
        "Dinah: Dance music! (Classic rock continues)",
        "Mallet: Classic rock.",
        "Dinah: And we fight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Get the fries if you want them.",
        "Dinah: Thank you. Are you going to get the fries?",
        "Mallet: Yeah.",
        "Dinah: All right, then, maybe I'll get the baked potato.",
        "Mallet: You don't want the fries?",
        "Dinah: No. I'll just have some of yours.",
        "Mallet: No, no, no, no. I get the fries because I want them. If you want fries, you got to get your own.",
        "Dinah: I don't my own. There are too many calories.",
        "Mallet: I don't ask you to order a salad so I can have some.",
        "Dinah: You don't even like salad.",
        "Mallet: No. You're right. I like the fries.",
        "Dinah: And we fight. But then we make up. And we make up. Wow, do we now how to make up! But there's more to us than that. One of the things I love most about sleeping with you is just sleeping with you. I love ordinary life. I've never had one before. (Laughs) It's a lot of fun, especially when you know somebody's got your back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: You said it would be like this, mom, once I let myself find the right guy. Maybe I should have listened to you more often.",
        "Vanessa: Sweetheart, with the right kind of love in your life, good things happen.",
        "Dinah: She's right. Since you came into my life, Mallet, I've learned how to be happy.",
        "Cassie: Dinah?",
        "Dinah: I've almost forgotten about my not so pretty past. Of course, the official reminder pops up or runs into me.",
        "Jeffrey: Sorry, listen, I'd love to chat. I'm late for work. Got to go.",
        "Dinah: Bye-bye! Thank God I'm done with him. Mr. Man of mystery. The best thing about Mallet is we have no secrets. I love that. Things are really looking up. Shoo. Shoo, kitty. Go. Stop, stop being so superstitious. I've got nothing to worry about. Hey, kitty, kitty. Hey, kitty, come here. Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, come here. Kitty, come on out. Kitty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vanessa: Oh, when I was your age, your grandfather was so full of advice, most of which I ignored. But you remember him. (Speaking in French) \"The early bird catches the worm.\" Well, I say, when it comes to weddings, it's all in the preparation.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Knock on the door)",
        "Alexandra: Ah! Well, there she is, all dressed for success.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, well, you woke me up at 5:00 A.M.",
        "Alexandra: Well, you know what today is, don't you? I sent you a memo.",
        "Dinah: Yeah. I have a 10:00 A.M. conference call with Marty Sellers from CMI, and I have an 11:00...",
        "Alexandra: No, no, no, no, no, no.",
        "Dinah: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Alexandra: Hmm. Well, I canceled all of that.",
        "Dinah: What are you talking about you, canceled all of that, Alexandra? You can't do that. I'm the Vice President. You don't have a title yet.",
        "Alexandra: Ah, well, try Spaulding at Spaulding. I think that trumps any V.P. any day.",
        "Dinah: You know what? I'm not going there. I'm not going to argue with you because I'm really too tired to argue with you. Why don't you just tell me why you asked me here so early in the morning.",
        "Alexandra: Hmm.",
        "Dinah: What's that?",
        "Alexandra: Go ahead.",
        "Dinah: Bridal magazines? I have bridal magazines. In fact, I have all of these. You know, I am not all that concerned about finding the right wedding dress. I can pretty much look great in anything.",
        "Alexandra: (Laughs) Yes, you can, but you're going to be representing Spaulding Enterprises, and I think you should therefore make quite a statement. By the way, is Vanessa helping you with any of these preparations?",
        "Dinah: Sort of.",
        "Alexandra: Thank God. (Chuckles)",
        "Dinah: Well, what the heck does that mean? You know, I don't even want to ask. I don't even know why I'm having this conversation. You know what? My wedding is none of your business.",
        "Alexandra: Well, I'm making it my business, darling.",
        "Dinah: You know, the only reason why you are interested in my wedding is because you think that if we have a star-studded wedding, that's going to somehow look good for the company.",
        "Alexandra: Well, of course, dear. (Chuckles) You know something? I'm surprised at you. Here you have a chance to be princess for the day, if only for a day, and you're turning you're nose up at it.",
        "Dinah: No, I'm not. I never said that I was going to have a simple, down-home wedding. My mom's going to pay for everything. She's not going to skimp on costs.",
        "Alexandra: Well, then, I think you're going to agree with me. Because you know, Dinah, I think you've come a long way since your carnival days, eh? And I think it's about time you showed the world just how far.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I'll show 'em, all right.",
        "Alexandra: And you know what? I've actually found a way for you to go top- notch without breaking the bank. (Laughs)",
        "Dinah: The Vicki Wong show. This is today.",
        "Alexandra: Yes, yes, you better go now. You don't have much time.",
        "Dinah: Are you sure about this?",
        "Alexandra: Mm-hmm. Yeah, the designer's a friend of mine. And if you have a big, burly girlfriend with sharp elbows, you might bring her along. Those things can get kind of nasty, you know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Hello, the Vicki Wong one-of-a-kind show. You're crazy. I know you want to go. Come on, baby. Come on, baby. Please? Okay! (Laughs) I knew it! Thank you. Thank you so much. Okay, I'll see you soon. Bye. Smokin'!",
        "Mallet: Oh, what time is it?",
        "Dinah: Baby, it's early. Go back to bed.",
        "Mallet: Ah, I can't. I got to get up soon, anyway. What are you doing? Are you going to work already?",
        "Dinah: No. Harley and I are going to look for a wedding gown.",
        "Mallet: Oh. Well, you tell Harley you're going to be able a little late.",
        "Dinah: (Laughs) No, no, no, no. Come on, this is important. Almost as important as you.",
        "Mallet: For the love of God, what store opens up this early?",
        "Dinah: It's not a store.",
        "Mallet: What is it, then?",
        "Dinah: It's an institution. Honey, Vicki Wong.",
        "Mallet: What is that?",
        "Dinah: Are you serious? She's the biggest designer ever. You know who she is.",
        "Mallet: I do?",
        "Dinah: Yes. She has this crazy half sale/half show every year. Brides from all over the country fly in.",
        "Mallet: To Springfield?",
        "Dinah: Uh-huh. If you don't get there early enough, you're out of luck. But I am feeling very lucky these days. Now, I'd love to sit, I'd love to chat, but I can't, okay? I have a whole day of wedding planning ahead of me.",
        "Mallet: Well, I would love to be a part of it, but, you know, I got that pesky cop job-thing, and I have a hang-nail on my left pinky that's really acting up, so I...",
        "Dinah: Honey, it's okay. You're off the hook. I am on it, okay? I am going to make sure we don't arrive at our engagement party without anything actually figured out.",
        "Mallet: Well, good. Good. Good luck. Break a leg, and not the arm of some chick reaching for the dress that you want.",
        "Dinah: Oh, no, no, no, no. I can't make any promises. A girl's got to do what she's to do. And I can't afford to be Wong today.",
        "Mallet: (Laughs) No, you won't. You won't be Wong; you'll be wite.",
        "Dinah: Hey! Good night! Honey, I'm happy, I'm happy. Who doesn't love a happy bride?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Once I get my hands on the right dress, everything else will just fall into place. Look at all of these crazed women! Eh, you know what? That's all right. I'm going to beat them at their own game. You know why? Because I look good in everything.",
        "Harley: Dinah?",
        "Dinah: Over here!",
        "Harley: I'm right here. Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey, come here. Wow. This is great. This is gonna be fun.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, it's a little crazy, but we're in the front of the line, and I think we're going to find what we're looking for.",
        "Harley: Perfect. What are we looking for?",
        "Dinah: We're looking for this.",
        "Harley: Oh, that's nice!",
        "Dinah: Nice?",
        "Harley: Gorgeous! Perfect. Beautiful. You're going to look great, no matter what.",
        "Dinah: Okay, love you.",
        "Harley: So we're looking for something like that, huh?",
        "Dinah: Yeah.",
        "Harley: I'm thinking maybe we should split up, Di.",
        "Dinah: You think?",
        "Man: Rule number one: No pushing.",
        "Dinah: Pushing? What does he think we are? Soccer fans? (Laughter)",
        "Man: Rule number two: No hoarding. Rule number three: No refunds.",
        "Harley: You know, Dinah, I heard these things can get pretty crazy.",
        "Dinah: Is it just me, or are these girls wearing tennis shoes and track suits?",
        "Man: Ready, ladies? And remember, you are ladies. (\"Chariots of fire\" playing)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vanessa: I don't know, some brides go overboard. You know, I think they just get caught up in the excitement of the moment, and they take things way too seriously.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Dinah, just grab something.",
        "Dinah: Ah!",
        "Harley: Hey, Dinah, I'm making some progress. I found some great dresses, but I lost you.",
        "Dinah: Harley, come on now. I need you to stay close, okay, because if I have to move fast, you're not going to be here, okay. And if I find the right dress, I need you to help me hold stuff and zip it.",
        "Harley: Hey, Dinah, I've got to admit, I'm getting a little claustrophobic here.",
        "Dinah: Jump up and down when you get this message, okay?",
        "Harley: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!",
        "Dinah: Hi.",
        "Harley: Okay, I found some really great dresses and I came awfully close, but I didn't find the one that you wanted. Sorry!",
        "Dinah: Oh, it's okay. Me, neither. Don't worry. Okay, we're going to find something. We're going to find something.",
        "Harley: We will. We will.",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Oh! That's it.",
        "Harley: Oh!",
        "Woman: Sorry, sister, I've been training for weeks. Bridal boot camp.",
        "Dinah: Story of my life. What I want is right there, and then bam, somebody else takes it. That girl's lucky this isn't the old days. She'd be staring down the barrel of a .44 magnum. (Sighs)",
        "Harley: Dinah, how are you?",
        "Dinah: I'm good. It probably made my butt look massive, anyway.",
        "Harley: That's not possible, A. and I'm proud of you because it wasn't so long ago that that poor girl...",
        "Dinah: Hey, don't go there. I don't get this. When did the bridal business become every woman for herself?",
        "Dinah: I don't know. Maybe the same time relationships did.",
        "Harley: Hey, listen, you're not weird about, you know, standing up for when I'm marrying you-know-who?",
        "Harley: Who? I'm kidding. No! I mean, it's a little weird, but no because I think you guys are good together, and I just want you to be happy.",
        "Dinah: Thank you. (Laughs) (cell phone rings)",
        "Harley: Sorry. Oh, it's the office again. I've got to go. I've got to go in. I'm sorry.",
        "Dinah: Hey, listen to me.",
        "Harley: Are you going to be okay?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I'm going to be fine. But you don't mind I'm taking the day off from work?",
        "Harley: You're getting married! No, of course not! But be careful because I'm telling you I think some of these women are armed.",
        "Dinah: Ow thank you.",
        "Harley: Okay, I'll call you.",
        "Dinah: Okay. Thank you. You know what? Who needs that dress anyway? I still got this bride thing under control. The wedding Gods have met their match.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Flower time! Let's go outside.",
        "Olivia: Hi! No! No, no, no, no! Here. This is the better lighting, out here.",
        "Dinah: Oh. Oh! You don't want to see Frank, do you?",
        "Olivia: I don't think that they want to see me.",
        "Dinah: Okay, well, let's go someplace else.",
        "Olivia: No, no, Rose is bringing more samples from her car. See? Pretty, huh?",
        "Dinah: Your florist's name is Rose?",
        "Olivia: Floral designer. She's kind of sensitive about that.",
        "Dinah: Okay, I'll try to remember that.",
        "Olivia: So how was the hunt for the perfect dress?",
        "Dinah: Bloodbath, but I'm still hunting.",
        "Rose: Excuse me.",
        "Olivia: Rose Pearson, Dinah Marler.",
        "Rose: It's lovely to meet you.",
        "Dinah: It is a pleasure!",
        "Rose: Olivia tells me you're thinking about orchids.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, yeah. I don't know much about them, but I thought, you know, they've always made pretty centerpieces.",
        "Rose: Yeah, for your mother's wedding, maybe.",
        "Dinah: Wow! You have beautiful things here. They're gorgeous!",
        "Rose: Hmm. It's the purple dendrobium. Very 2004.",
        "Dinah: Oh, yeah, that was a good year. That was a good year. Nice, I like that. (Sneezes)",
        "Olivia: Bless you.",
        "Dinah: Ooh, excuse me!",
        "Rose: And this is the...",
        "Dinah: (Sneezes)",
        "Rose: Olivia, I can't work this way.",
        "Dinah: Oh, maybe you won't have to.",
        "Olivia: Oh, listen, Rose...",
        "Dinah: (Sneezes)",
        "Olivia: She has allergies. I would not take this personally.",
        "Dinah: I don't know why. It's never been this bad before.",
        "Olivia: Rose is a creative genius. I'm sure she will come up with a solution, right.",
        "Dinah: (Sneezes) Oh, okay. I can't even believe this is happening. I'm so embarrassed. I thought maybe I could find a flower that doesn't irritate me so much.",
        "Rose: Somehow I doubt it. Maybe you should consider silk.",
        "Dinah: What? Silk? I don't want silk. I want real flowers.",
        "Olivia: Rose, don't you have any other options?",
        "Rose: Well, there are certain scent-free varieties.",
        "Dinah: Scent-free? Scent-free?",
        "Olivia: Scent-free.",
        "Dinah: Scent-free? Do you think maybe you could have mentioned this about 15 minutes ago?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Blake, thank you for the referral, but you can go ahead. You don't have to wait around.",
        "Blake: I don't mind.",
        "Dinah: Okay, you know what? If you're doing this out of some sense of obligation to my father...",
        "Blake: What does it matter?",
        "Dinah: I don't know. Call me old-fashioned, but I kind of like planning my wedding with people who actually like me.",
        "Blake: Dinah, I'm fine with you. In fact, I'm available to be a bridesmaid, if you're looking for one.",
        "Dinah: Sorry, it's a done deal.",
        "Blake: Fine. Shut me up. You know, your father would be so disappointed. Disappointed, but not surprised.",
        "Dinah: What the hell does that mean?",
        "Blake: You still don't know how to rise to the occasion, do you?",
        "Dinah: And you still don't know how to keep your nose out of people's business.",
        "Blake: You know something? You look horrible. Your eyes are all red and your face is all puffy.",
        "Dinah: Well, maybe that's because I'm apparently allergic to every flower that ever was.",
        "Blake: Oh, since when, you little sissy?",
        "Dinah: You know what? Go home. Just leave.",
        "Blake: No, no, no, no. You know why? Because I happen to be very good friends with Cookie. And if I'm here, you're going to get a good deal.",
        "Dinah: Cookie?",
        "Blake: She owns the bakery.",
        "Dinah: Rose the florist and Cookie the baker?",
        "Bob: Hi, I'm Bob.",
        "Dinah: Hi, I'm Dinah. Where's Cookie?",
        "Bob: She no longer works here. I'm her son. I've taken over the business.",
        "Dinah: Oh, well, I'm Dinah Marler. Hi. Pleasure to meet you.",
        "Bob: Marler? Any relation to Ross Marler?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, he was my father. Hey, where are you going?",
        "Bob: I'm all booked up.",
        "Dinah: Since when?",
        "Bob: Since your father sent my mother to prison for embezzlement.",
        "Dinah: I can't even believe this. Do you hear this, Blake? Do you hear this?",
        "Blake: How was I supposed to know?",
        "Bob: I hate sugar, and now I'm stuck running this damn place.",
        "Dinah: Well, I'm sorry to hear that, Bob.",
        "Bob: Save it. Mother had a gambling problem, but did the great Ross Marler care? No. Self-righteous jerk.",
        "Dinah: Hey! Watch who you're calling \"Jerk,\" cakeboy!",
        "Bob: Says who? Deadly Dinah? Isn't that what the tabloids used to call you?",
        "Dinah: Stay calm. Stay calm. Think sweet thoughts. Raindrops, roses, kittens. Okay, Bob. You know what? I am very confident that we're going to be able to handle all of this together.",
        "Bob: Yeah, right. What my mother did was nothing compared to you. You're a murderer, but your dad didn't lift a finger to bring you to justice. What a hypocrite!",
        "Dinah: You know something, Bob? You know what I like? I like devil foods cake. I do. I think it's wonderful. Have you ever had it? Why don't you taste? I hear it's the best in the city! Huh? Have you ever tried chocolate?",
        "Blake: Dinah!",
        "Dinah: Huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Then you smashed the cupcake upside the baker's head.",
        "Dinah: Yes.",
        "Mallet: Mm-hmm. So how did the butcher and the candlestick maker fair?",
        "Vanessa: Don't worry, darling. Planning the perfect wedding is a piece of cake.",
        "Dinah: Mom, stop. I know you do everything right.",
        "Mallet: Your mom. Your mom? What else are these voices telling you to do?",
        "Dinah: Treat me like any other perp, okay, honey?",
        "Mallet: Okay, fine. So Ms. Marler, the cupcake in question, did it have a filling and if it did, what flavor, and it is important to the investigation.",
        "Dinah: The guy insulted my father.",
        "Mallet: Right, because Ross sent his mother to the big house for embezzlement.",
        "Dinah: Yes.",
        "Mallet: (Laughs)",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Mallet: I just think it's kind of funny. It's funny, okay, the idea of a baker stealing dough.",
        "Dinah: What if Baker Bob decides to press charges?",
        "Mallet: Then you're up a creek. I'll have no choice but to charge you with assault with a deadly baked good.",
        "Dinah: Honey, stop. This morning I was so happy. I was convinced nothing was going to ruin my happiness. I jinxed us. Oh, Blake, what do you want?",
        "Blake: What do you want first, the good news or the bad news?",
        "Dinah: Just spit it out.",
        "Blake: Well, thanks to me, Baker Bob isn't pressing charges.",
        "Dinah: Great, what's the bad news?",
        "Blake: He's not going to do your wedding.",
        "Dinah: Screw him.",
        "Mallet: Thanks, Blake, for talking to him. No charges, I guess I can let you go, Ms. Marler, which means you can make your next appointment.",
        "Dinah: You know what? I will not be having a next appointment.",
        "Blake: There is a new bakery down by the water, and we can go right over there.",
        "Dinah: No, no. That's okay. I'm good. I'm good.",
        "Mallet: Just go with her. Blake just wants to help.",
        "Dinah: No. I'm fine. Maybe you can just go, please.",
        "Blake: My pleasure.",
        "Mallet: I hope at our wedding she's sitting at our table.",
        "Dinah: I don't think you understand what kind of day I've had. You think this whole thing is a joke.",
        "Mallet: If you want me to help out more with the planning, because I'll do that.",
        "Dinah: We'll have more chips and beer, and for the honeymoon, we'll be at Niagara Falls. I think the bigger question will be: Dinah, will there be a wedding? Because right now I don't have the answer to that question. Mallet does not get it. I tell him about the dress and the flowers and the cake, and it doesn't register. The wedding Gods, they're conspiring against us. I see it, why can't he? Instead, all he does is makes jokes. He could care less.",
        "Mallet: You owe me. I went to the newsstand. That's the equivalent of buying tampons.",
        "Dinah: You bought me magazines?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I thought they would help.",
        "Dinah: Think again. I have this one and I have this one. I'd like you to understand. Is it too much to ask of you?",
        "Mallet: I do understand. You had a bad day. You go back to the drawing board and you start fresh.",
        "Dinah: You know what? I don't want to start fresh. I'm done planning this wedding. I want you to do it.",
        "Mallet: You want me to plan the wedding?",
        "Dinah: Yes. Because then you'll know how it feels.",
        "Mallet: How it feels for what?",
        "Dinah: How it feels to fail. Your girlfriend can't cut it. She can't cut it. My mom and Alexandra will have you thinking there is nothing to it. But they haven't met Rose, the florist designer. She gives thorny a whole new name.",
        "Mallet: That's it. We'll call the whole thing off.",
        "Dinah: No, that's not what I'm saying. Although I did want to do that at first.",
        "Mallet: You did? You wanted to call the whole thing off?",
        "Dinah: Yeah.",
        "Mallet: Why?",
        "Dinah: It was spontaneous when you asked me to marry you and we were on a television show, which is like amazing, but I woke up the next morning and I just...",
        "Mallet: You started to panic. You started thinking and imagining not only walking down the aisle, but walking into like a 40-year commitment.",
        "Dinah: 50. People in my family live longer.",
        "Mallet: Your chest started to get tight and your throat constricted, and you started to remember every mistake you made in every relationship you have ever been in.",
        "Dinah: Exactly. How did you know?",
        "Mallet: Because I'm not just the president, I'm also a member.",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Mallet: Nothing. Never mind.",
        "Dinah: Honey, why didn't you say anything?",
        "Mallet: Because you were happy, and I was totally into it. And the past is the past. I'm into it. I'm cool with the 40- 50-year commitment. But for me to make 50 years, you might have to freeze my head. I eat a lot of hot dogs.",
        "Dinah: Oh, honey, I'm such a mess, I'm sorry.",
        "Mallet: You had a bad day. But you're kind of cute when you have bad days.",
        "Dinah: Cute enough to marry?",
        "Mallet: Bathrobe and all.",
        "Dinah: I think it is much cuter than a one-of-a-kind gown.",
        "Mallet: Nah. The truth is, if I get to put that ring on your finger, that's all that matters. I'll make a deal with you.",
        "Dinah: Okay.",
        "Mallet: If this whole wedding-planning stuff starts to stress you out again, we'll just elope. We'll come up with a code word, a secret password that only you and I know. And if it gets too much, you scream it, and we get in the car and cruise down the highway and find the nearest judge or priest or ship's cabin.",
        "Dinah: What do you think about jigsaw?",
        "Mallet: For the word?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Jigsaw.",
        "Mallet: Jigsaw.",

        "Vanessa: Okay, okay, blah, blah, blah, I know I've been giving you way too much advice, doling it out, but you don't have to listen. You don't, sweetheart, because all you have to do is follow your instincts. They're good. They won't lead you astray but who ever listens to their mother, right?",
        "Dinah: I do. I do love you, Mommy.",
        "Vanessa: Thank you. Come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: I'm ready to get on the frickin' horse again. Start from square one.",
        "Mallet: Beautiful, nice. She's back.",
        "Dinah: Honey, it is all coming together. I can feel it. I can feel it. I'm going to get a better dress, I'm going to get a better florist. I will bake my own freakin' wedding cake.",
        "Mallet: Good. I'll find us a baker. We need to find a baker. What was that one we liked, the lavender lust? No, the orange orchid.",
        "Dinah: You're so sweet. Oh, my God, it's cowgirl, my archenemy.",
        "Mallet: What?",
        "Dinah: Come here.",
        "Mallet: That's the girl who stole your dress?",
        "Dinah: Yeah.",
        "Mallet: She doesn't look so tough.",
        "Dinah: She is wiry with reflexes like a mongoose.",
        "Mallet: I can see that.",
        "Dinah: I wonder what is the matter.",
        "Mallet: Dinah, Dinah, I recognize that look. I'm going to warn you, just stay away from the pies.",
        "Dinah: Hey.",
        "Woman: Oh, go away.",
        "Dinah: Well, you look upset. Is there anything I can do to help at all?",
        "Woman: Why would you care? I stole your dress.",
        "Dinah: Oh, there are more important things in life than dresses. Tell me what is wrong?",
        "Woman: My fianc\u00e9e called off the wedding. Ever since he took over the family business, he has been stressed out.",
        "Dinah: I work for a family business. It's a pain in the neck. Horrible.",
        "Woman: Tell me about it. It is totally not what he wanted to do. And then some crazy lady smashes cupcakes in this face. He snaps. I hate Bob the baker!",
        "Dinah: I love you, wedding Gods. Honey, I cannot believe it, but I finally found the dress of my dreams.",
        "Mallet: You scored. Lucky, lucky, lucky.",
        "Dinah: No, I'm not lucky, it is down right logical. Good things happen when you're around. Maybe I should go back to work with you.",
        "Mallet: I think you're doing just fine on your own.",
        "Dinah: Yeah? Still, you are good for me. You bring out the best in me there has ever been.",
        "Mallet: Well, for the record, you've kind of done a number on me, too. (Cell phone rings)",
        "Dinah: Work. Work. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.",
        "Mallet: Oh, what are you doing? Why did you do that?",
        "Dinah: I'm tired, I'm done. I am done proving myself with Spaulding, with my wedding, with proving everybody-- I don't know, that I'm just this super woman, I'm not. It causes trouble for me, and I get tense, and people don't like me when I'm like that. And quite honestly, I'm the happiest I've ever been right now.",
        "Mallet: Really? I wish I had a tape recorder.",
        "Dinah: Why?",
        "Mallet: So you never forget what you're feeling at this moment.",
        "Dinah: Blah, blah, blah.",
        "Mallet: I have to go. Don't worry, your day is not going to start falling apart.",
        "Dinah: Oh, God, I hope not. It is all in your head. Everything is going to be fine. All right?",
        "Dinah: Okay.",
        "Mallet: You know when you're luck starts to change, don't you? You get rid of that chip, that chip on your shoulder. You don't have to prove that to yourself by throwing away that perfectly good cell phone. Everything is going to be fine.",
        "(Cell phone ringing)",
        "Dinah: Hey, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: I think I solved your flower problem.",
        "Dinah: Oh, that's genius, great. Okay. All right. I'll see you soon. Bye. Well, what do you know? I think things are finally looking up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Once upon a time, there was a carnival orphan who grew up to be a convicted felon and town pariah, and her enemies were all around her. (Applause) But with a little self-control and the love of the best guy in the land, she eventually blossomed into a respected member of society. (Applause) A successful business executive, and the prettiest darn bride there ever was. (Applause) Because all those years, her only real enemy was her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Which Spaulding executive isn't just shopping for a wedding gown, but for her boss' husband? What else are they hiding?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: And the only thing that stood between her and happily ever after was her fear that somebody would come along and take it all away.",
