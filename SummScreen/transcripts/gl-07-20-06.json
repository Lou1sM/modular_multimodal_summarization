Possibility of another\r\nveterans' center right here in Springfield. I was \r\n\r\ngoing to fax this stuff over\r\nto his office, but if you're going to see him later \r\n\r\ntoday maybe, um...maybe you\r\ncould give it to him yourself. \r\n\r\n",
        "Cassie: \r\n\r\nAbsolutely. Sure, I'll, you know,\r\nI'll take a look at it and I'll give it to him in person \r\n\r\nwhen I see him this\r\nweekend. (Clears throat) ",

That's a \r\n\r\nbeautiful turtle. That is\r\nthe most beautiful purple turtle I think I've ever \r\n\r\nseen. Let's make the graphs\r\ninto, um, into big buildings. Skyscrapers, okay? (Chuckles)",
        "Alan-Michael: \r\n\r\nSo, that's what you think of\r\nthe company quarterly finances. \r\n\r\n",
        "Harley: And \r\n\r\nwhat if it is? ",
        "Alan-Michael: \r\n\r\nThen I've only one thing to\r\nsay to you. Dibs on the cherry red. Is that a \r\n\r\nshark? ",

The way you're able to juggle it all. \r\n\r\nHaving quality time with\r\nthe kids and getting your job done at the office. \r\n\r\nBack when I wanted your job, I\r\nused to think that was a weakness. You know, \r\n\r\nsplit focus, but now I see it for\r\nwhat it is. Keeping your priorities straight. \r\n\r\n",

        "Mallet: What? \r\n\r\n",
        "Dinah: Well, \r\n\r\nthis sleaze was obviously an\r\namateur photography with a very long lens. \r\n\r\n",
        "Mallet: Dinah, \r\n\r\nthis web site's not a joke. \r\n\r\n",

        "Mallet: No. No, \r\n\r\nsomeone's been watching you.\r\nSomeone actually took time to spy on you and \r\n\r\nGus. Obviously to make you both\r\nlook bad. ",
        "Dinah: Well, \r\n\r\nyou know what, honey, the did\r\nit. They achieved their goal. Let me tell you \r\n\r\nsomething. I told you and Gus, I\r\ntold Harley, I told everybody who was important \r\n\r\nand they understand that the\r\nonly reason that happened was because Gus was \r\n\r\non his pills. And the other\r\nreason... ",
        "Mallet: Hmm? \r\n\r\n",
        "Dinah: \r\n\r\nBecause I'm incredibly attractive.\r\nAnd I know you know that. \r\n\r\n",
        "Mallet: I'm not \r\n\r\nlaughing this off, okay?\r\nThis is not funny. You got a Spaulding board \r\n\r\nmeeting coming up, right? \r\n\r\n",
        "Dinah: Yup. \r\n\r\n",
        "Mallet: Right, \r\n\r\nwell what if someone's trying\r\nto whip up trouble, okay? For both you and \r\n\r\nHarley? All right, that's an idea.\r\nAnd what if this is just the tip of the iceberg-- \r\n\r\n",
        "Dinah: What if \r\n\r\nthe girl that you're\r\nintending to marry asked you to just let it go. Let \r\n\r\nit go, please? Okay? You\r\nshould just ask her to kiss her 'til she's mush. \r\n\r\nPlease? Honey, I'm going to be\r\nfine. I'm fine. ",

        "Cassie: I am \r\n\r\nnot running anywhere, and I saw\r\nhim yesterday. ",
        "Josh: In his \r\n\r\nhotel room. ",
        "Cassie: I saw \r\n\r\nhim yesterday and I was\r\nthinking that maybe I made a mistake by \r\n\r\nbreaking it off. ",
        "Josh: A \r\n\r\nmistake? ",
        "Cassie: Okay, \r\n\r\nso he lied to me. Yeah,\r\nbut...no one's perfect. I sure as hell am not. \r\n\r\n",
        "Josh: Okay. \r\n\r\nYou know, it's really not my\r\nbusiness at all. I just want to make sure that this is \r\n\r\nnot a reaction to, us,\r\nbasically. You know, what we said to each other \r\n\r\nthe other day. ",
        "Cassie: Well, \r\n\r\nI'm not going to lie to you, Josh.\r\nI mean, what we said to each other the other day \r\n\r\ndoes make a difference. It\r\nmakes a good difference, I think, because now I \r\n\r\nknow that what I feel.. what we\r\nfeel...is not something that's strange, it's just \r\n\r\nhuman. We're human, and it's\r\nfine. So we've acknowledged it and we're going to \r\n\r\nmove past it, and for me that\r\nmeans I can take a look at my feelings for Jeffrey \r\n\r\nand see if maybe he actually\r\nis the man that I was running from all.. you know \r\n\r\nwhat? I don\u2019t... I don't\r\nknow. Does any of that make sense to you? \r\n\r\nUnderstand? ",
        "Josh: If you \r\n\r\ndo. ",
        "Cassie: I just \r\n\r\nthink this is the right thing\r\nfor me. And for you. ",
        "Josh: Have a \r\n\r\ngreat weekend. And don't worry\r\nabout the project. It will be waiting for you when \r\n\r\nyou get back. As will I. ",
