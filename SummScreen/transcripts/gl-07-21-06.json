        "Jonathan: You got to tell me when you're going to hang out in our part of the suite.",
        "Lizzie: Maybe you should have a sign-in sheet. You know, you should be massaging my feet.",
        "Jonathan: Excuse me?",
        "Lizzie: Right here. In black and white. Massaging my feet, going with me for check-ups, telling me I'm pretty, buying me stuff.",
        "Jonathan: (Laughs) Should I also tell you that you don't really look that huge?",
        "Lizzie: Seriously, there's stuff we haven't worked out. Eww!",
        "Jonathan: We're not working anything out. You're living here, that's cool with me, but we are not raising that kid together.",
        "Lizzie: \"That kid\"?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. The kid that's got your grandfather on the fast track to ruining my life. Where's Tammy? She should be home by now.",

        "Harley: I want a double cheeseburger. I am starving! Where is everybody...?",
        "Manny: Don't do anything stupid! Whoa, lady, don't be a hero. Not today.",

        "Reva: Joshua. You're here.",
        "Josh: As I should be.",
        "Reva: I didn't want you to see me this way. I didn't want you to know.",
        "Josh: The single most insane thing you've ever done. I'm here now. That's all that matters.",
        "Reva: I know. Now I have hope.",
        "Gretel: Are you awake now?",
        "Reva: How did you know?",
        "Gretel: You're not talking in your sleep anymore.",
        "Reva: Oh, God. What'd I say?",
        "Gretel: One name: Joshua.",
        "Reva: That's my guy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You can't do that.",
        "Josh: I was just trying to get you to see something. You can't get involved with Jeffrey O'Neil again because it's going to cause a lot of pain for you and I think you already know that.",
        "Cassie: Josh.",
        "Josh: The only reason you're messing around with him now is because what's happening here is complicated.",
        "Cassie: Complicated? Yeah, and so you almost kiss me?",
        "Josh: Well, that wasn't the plan, it was--",
        "Cassie: But you would've kissed me, knowing what you know?",
        "Josh: There's a difference between knowing what you know and knowing that what you know is true, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: And what does that mean?",
        "Josh: I'm not really sure, I just--",
        "Cassie: Okay, you know, I know, we're all in the know. You must also know how much I hate myself for the way I feel, and you were going to kiss me to make a point?",
        "Josh: No, Cassie. That's not it. That's not why I was going to do it. That's-- that's not... that's not it at all.",

        "Colin: Mr. Lewis? Mr. Lewis, I want you to wake up now.",
        "Billy: It's over?",
        "Colin: I'm sorry, Billy, we couldn't continue.",
        "Billy: Wait, a minute. I thought I was a match.",
        "Colin: You were a preliminary match, yes, but the test you took at Cedars failed to catch the fact that you suffer from a condition called Ostenecrosis. You have decreased activity in the stem cells in the bone marrow in your hip. You're marrow's been compromised.",
        "Billy: But Reva needs me. She's--",
        "Colin: Billy, there's nothing I can do. I'm truly sorry. You can't save Reva.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Hi, Bud. I'll be back soon, I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colin: There you go.",
        "Billy: So, what happened, Doc?",
        "Colin: Well, one of the common causes of Osteonecrosis is steroid use.",
        "Billy: Do I look like a steroid user?",
        "Colin: Yeah. Another frequent cause is alcohol abuse.",
        "Billy: Alcohol? Yeah, I never thought my drinking would be...",
        "Colin: You were a drinker, huh?",
        "Billy: And then some.",
        "Colin: Listen, Reva doesn't need to know the specifics. We're just going to tell her that it didn't work out. She doesn't even know you were the donor, so...",
        "Billy: No. Doc, have you ever... have you ever let somebody down that you love? I mean, really, really, cared for? Well, then you kind of know what I have to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Are you sure you're old enough to hear this story?",
        "Gretel: Just make it PG-13. We'll be all right.",
        "Reva: The PG-13 version. Hmm. Well, in that version, I was a young girl who was out to prove herself. Out to find love, out to take on the world. I was a young girl who was a housekeeper's daughter.",
        "Gretel: So your mom was a maid, and that gave you self- esteem issues?",
        "Reva: (Laughs) You know something? You are wise beyond your years.",
        "Gretel: So what was your first move?",
        "Reva: I fell in love with the cutest boy in town, who also happened to be part of the richest family in town.",
        "Gretel: Fairy-tale love, or real love? I read a lot, okay?",
        "Reva: (Laughs) Well, I guess it was both, really.",
        "Gretel: So you were soul mates?",
        "Reva: Soul mates 'til the end.",
        "Gretel: So what happened?",
        "Reva: Well, we had a falling out and so I married his brother. Then I married his daddy. And then I married him, finally.",
        "Gretel: Yikes. All three?",
        "Reva: But it was really always just me and Joshua.",
        "Gretel: Joshua. I like how you say that.",
        "Reva: Well, I like saying it. Everything in my life begins and ends with Joshua. We were married more than once. We had children together. He saved my life on more than one occasion. Through it all, I made his life one painful roller coaster ride.",
        "Gretel: He said that?",
        "Reva: In so many words. But he never stopped loving me.",
        "Colin: So where is he now?",
        "Reva: Probably wondering when he'll see me again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: I didn't put my arms around you just now because I was trying to make a point.",
        "Cassie: Then why did you do it?",
        "Josh: Because I didn't want you to leave. I wanted to stop you because I wanted to feel something right in my life. And I thought kissing you would feel right.",
        "Cassie: It would feel right, but it's wrong. We both know that, Josh. It is so wrong. Just being here and feeling these things is wrong. I can't even imagine... I can't even imagine how devastated Reva would be. It would kill her.",
        "Josh: I don't even know where she is right now.",
        "Cassie: I'm sure there's some explanation for why she's not here.",
        "Josh: Yeah, and I don't really care anymore. I don't know where she is. I don't know how to get in touch with her. I'm done with it. I can't wait for her any longer.",
        "Cassie: You love her, Josh. You love Reva.",
        "Josh: I know. I love her. I do. But loving her has just been one let down after another-- one complication, one disaster. One hurt like you wouldn't believe.",
        "Cassie: And you think loving me would be easy and painless?",
        "Josh: Yes. Yeah, I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Here.",
        "Lizzie: Thanks.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy's been gone a while.",
        "Lizzie: What, does she have to check in with you every hour?",
        "Jonathan: Well, I don't know why she's not answering her cell phone.",
        "Lizzie: Maybe it's dead. Look, I think that you're avoiding my question. I want to know what you want with me and the baby.",
        "Jonathan: Could you shut up and be grateful for a minute?! We don't always have to be all about you. Can you think about Tammy?",
        "Lizzie: Hey, I care about Tammy. Tammy's one of my only friends.",
        "Jonathan: And she's the only thing I care about, period, so does that answer your question?",
        "Lizzie: Fine.",
        "Jonathan: Let me tell you something else, Lizzie. If anything happens to her-- if she stubs her toe or gets a paper cut-- you'd better call your butler and pack your things because you will be leaving.",
        "Lizzie: I think that you talk a big game, but honestly, I don't think you'd ever leave me or the baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Manny: All right, everyone just calm down and take a seat! Do what I say and you won't get hurt.",
        "Joe: Who knows how to work the register?",
        "Gus: Once you let the girls go, you can have the register. Just take it, nobody cares.",
        "Manny: Hey, big man, I don't think anyone asked you to talk.",
        "Harley: Please shut up. Please.",
        "Manny: Lady, be quiet.",
        "Harley: No, I'm agreeing with you. What's your name again?",
        "Manny: Don't worry about what my name is.",
        "Joe: Manny, maybe we should go!",
        "Manny: Shut your mouth, Joe!",
        "Gus: Manny, Joe... where's Carly, in the car waiting?",
        "Manny: What are you laughing about?",
        "Gus: I'm just saying, maybe your names should be Curly and Moe .",
        "Harley: Please don't do this. Please don't do this.",
        "Gus: What? Do what?",
        "Harley: Why do you have to run your mouth? Why do you have to always be talking?",
        "Gus: You seem to be the one who's talking. I'm not doing anything.",
        "Harley: I can't... we're gonna get killed! (Gus and Harley talking over each other)",
        "Manny: We're not going to kill anyone!",
        "Joe: Manny, maybe we should split, man!",
        "Harley: You always say if we ever got into a situation like this you'd handle it so differently. Well, here's your chance!",
        "Gus: What are you talking about? The way that you keep running our mouth we could go and have our brains splattered all over the wall!",
        "Joe: Shut up!",
        "Harley: You are not a hero.",
        "Gus: Oh, you just don't know when to quit, do you?",
        "Manny: All right, settle down! Sit down!",
        "Gus: Good luck, I've been trying to get her to do that for years.",
        "Harley: I have a condition.",
        "Gus: Uh-oh, here's she goes with the condition.",
        "Harley: I do!",
        "Gus: Yeah, does it include constipation in the brain? Huh? Hey!",
        "Harley: (Grunts) (Harley and Manny grunting)",
        "Gus: You don't want a to-go bag?",
        "Harley: I should have kicked mine in the jewels when I had the chance.",
        "Gus: You did good, honey. Tammy, are you okay?",
        "Tammy: Yeah.",
        "Gus: All right. Be right back.",
        "Harley: Uh huh.",
        "Tammy: Oh, you guys were incredible.",
        "Harley: No, no. Believe it or not, that's Gus' first day back on the job. You all right?",
        "Tammy: Yeah, I think so. I was just scared. You guys saved my life.",
        "Harley: Don't go overboard.",
        "Remy: I got the call. Tammy, are you okay?",
        "Tammy: Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.",
        "Harley: Here, there were two of them. (Phone rings) It's Dinah. The board meeting! I have my speech!",
        "Gus: Go, go. Do your speech. We got this, go.",
        "Harley: Are you sure?",
        "Remy: Hey, hey, we're the cops. Okay, I'm sure as long as everyone's okay.",
        "Harley: (Laughs) I think we just dodged a bullet.",
        "Gus: Tammy, Tammy, are you alright?",
        "Remy: Tammy!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I've been doing a lot of thinking about us. There is a reason why you took me in.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I have this thing for stray dogs.",
        "Lizzie: No, you have a thing for the little bean growing inside of me.",
        "Jonathan: The what?",
        "Lizzie: Little bean. Little girl. Little piece of you. Oh, you're starting to care about her.",
        "Jonathan: No. Let's get one thing straight. The only reason I'm putting up with you is not because of the baby, it's not because I feel sorry for you. It's Tammy.",
        "Lizzie: You don't care about me and the baby even a little bit? A little bit?",
        "Jonathan: Tammy. She's what I live for. She's the only thing I care about in this world.",
        "Lizzie: For now.",
        "Jonathan: Forever. (Phone ringing) Tammy? Remy? What are you doing with her phone? An accident? Where is she now?",
        "Lizzie: Jonathan, wait! Wait!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: I know that what we have going on here is... complicated beyond belief, but being with you, caring about you, is easy.",
        "Cassie: There is nothing easy about this situation, Josh. And caring for me the way you do isn't love.",
        "Josh: What you have with Jeffrey O'Neil isn't love.",
        "Cassie: I know. I know. I'm not going to run to Jeffrey anymore.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Cassie: So, that doesn't solve our problem. What in the hell are we supposed to do now?",
        "Josh: The only thing we can do.",
        "Cassie: And what's that?",
        "Josh: Fight it.",
        "Cassie: Fight it.",
        "Josh: And try to pretend like it wasn't there, like it wasn't real.",
        "Cassie: It's not just going to go away.",
        "Josh: No, because we let it go too far and it just can't happen, that's all.",
        "Cassie: It just can't happen. So, we just have to fight it.",
        "Josh: We'll stay apart from each other, if that's what we have to do.",
        "Cassie: And you will get Reva back. I can feel that.",
        "Josh: And this thing that we're feeling. (Phone rings)",
        "Cassie: (Clears throat) It's Tammy. Hello? This is... this is Cassie. How did you get my daughter's phone? Oh, my God. Um... I'll... I'll...",
        "Josh: What is it?",
        "Cassie: Tammy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Billy. What are you doing out there?",
        "Gretel: Is that one of the guys?",
        "Reva: That's the brother.",
        "Gretel: (Giggles)",
        "Reva: (Laughs)",
        "Billy: Yeah, I know a lot better than to come walking in a room where girls are giggling.",
        "Reva: (Laughs) It's okay. I was just regaling my roomie here with tales from my sordid past. Isn't that right, Gretel?",
        "Gretel: I'm going to take a nap. Just hearing your life story made me tired.",
        "Reva: Sweet dreams, kiddo. So, did you perform your \"clean room\" routine?",
        "Billy (with fake French accent): You will get no diseases from me.",
        "Reva: Get in here. You know what I was just thinking about? That road trip we always wanted to take to the Rockies. You know, rent a camper, sleep out under the stars, cook on an open fire.",
        "Billy: Mmm, yeah. I make a mean pork and beans.",
        "Reva: (Laughs) Yeah. Maybe we'll even invite Josh. Is there something you wanted to talk to me about?",
        "Billy: Yeah, there's something I have to tell you. The donor fell through.",
        "Reva: Did Colin...?",
        "Billy: Yeah. The transplant's off. I'm sorry to let you down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim Zimmer, \"Inside The Light.\" Well, the whole bald cap thing. I... there was, there was a moment where I thought, I should probably just shave my head because it would make life for everyone a whole lot easier. And then I remember all the accidents I had as a kid growing up where I had skis in my head, and nicks and bumps and bicycle accidents and... it wouldn't have been a pretty head to see bald, so I kind of threw that out, besides the fact that my husband said \"Absolutely not!\" See Reva, Wednesday, July 26 \"Inside The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Okay, it's clear. Go ahead.",
        "Harley: Stop!",
        "Gus: No problem. See, I'm just doing my job because you're like the most powerful woman in business today. At least in this town. Yeah. You don't know who's lurking and trying to take it away from you. They could be around the corner. A mugger, a Spaulding. You never know.",
        "Harley: Would you just watch the door while I change, please?",
        "Gus: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Actually, can I just watch you while you change?",
        "Harley: Honey, you can watch me while I change later.",
        "Gus: I am proud of you. I'm very proud of you.",
        "Harley: Thank you.",
        "Gus: The way you got those bad guys.",
        "Harley: Did you see that move? When I took the guy to the ground? Come on, that was cool.",
        "Gus: Yeah, yeah. I saw that. Not shabby. Not too shabby at all. I wouldn't say you're rusty.",
        "Harley: Who said \"rusty\"?",
        "Gus: I said \"trusty.\" You're very trust-- you're good. You're great!",
        "Harley: It's been so long since I busted anybody. I forgot what a rush that is!",
        "Gus: Because you've had a lot of things on your mind wearing the corporate suit and issuing corporate beat-downs. You know.",
        "Harley: It's not the same thing, though.",
        "Gus: No? You okay?",
        "Harley: Honey? Schnoogums?",
        "Gus: Uh-oh.",
        "Harley: I've been thinking...",
        "Gus: That's not good.",
        "Dinah: Okay. I have the latest revisions to your speech, typo-free, and I also have some projected earnings from the budget office and they're waffling a little bit on the earnings, but, you know, that's because they work with Alan and they're not used to telling the truth. But, most importantly, I found that rosy grapefruit lipstick you thought you lost. Huh? Oh, hey. Are you ready for this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Are you saying that the bone marrow donor wasn't a match after all?",
        "Billy: No, no, no. It wasn't the donor; it was a problem with the bone marrow itself.",
        "Reva: But I thought...",
        "Billy: Yeah. Yeah, we all thought it. Preliminary tests, and... but during the operation, the doctor, he found out that it was no good. I mean, there was nothing he could do. The bone marrow was viable. I'm so sorry to let you down. The bone marrow wasn't viable.",
        "Reva: No, Billy. Stop talking like that. It wasn't your fault. It's not like they were sucking marrow out of you.",
        "Billy: Well, the marrow was no good because of alcohol abuse. Years of drinking. My drinking.",
        "Reva: You were my donor.",
        "Billy: Yeah. Darling, I was so proud. And I was so tickled that I was a match for you. I mean, I thought it was God saying, \"Billy-boy, here's a chance you're going to have to make good on all those times you let people down.\" Especially-- when I almost killed you in a car accident I said I'd take care of you no matter what happened. Here I thought, \"Now you're going to get a chance to make good on your promise,\" and my alcoholism made my bone marrow not good enough for you. And I think I'm not good enough for you.",
        "Reva: You stop that. You stop it right now.",
        "Billy: Now, Reva, I'm just talking facts here. I mean, if there's one fact that we've all known, and if we haven't, we should have, it's you need Josh. You always have, you always will. You need him now more than ever, and you got to call him.",

        "Nurse: Thank you so much, okay?",
        "Cassie: Excuse me! My daughter was brought in. Tammy Winslow?",

        "Cassie: What are they saying? How serious is it?",
        "Nurse: We don't know anything yet, but I'll let you know as soon we do, okay?",
        "Cassie: Okay. Oh, God! Why is this happening? Why did this happen to her? She's so young!",
        "Josh: Cassie, Tammy's going to be okay.",

        "Josh: I have faith.",

        "Jonathan: I don't have to wait to know anything. I know that it was Alan who did it. Who else has it out for me and Tammy like that?",
        "Lizzie: No, come on! He wouldn't put her in the hospital.",
        "Jonathan: No, because he's never shot his own kid and then married their wife, and he's never spent any time in an insane asylum or a jail. And you had better hope that she recovers from this because if she doesn't-- where is she? Where is she?",
        "Remy: Settle down, settle down, all right? Tammy was caught in the middle of a botched robbery at Company. She hit her head. We thought she was fine, but then she collapsed. She has a brain contusion. She's been unconscious for the past half hour.",
        "Jonathan: She's...",
        "Remy: Unconscious. The doctors are working on her right now, okay? I'll let you go and see her, but you've got to calm down, Jonathan. Now, I'm not your enemy.",
        "Jonathan: Okay, okay. Where?",
        "Lizzie: Thanks for all your help, Remy.",
        "Remy: I'm going to go follow up on the robbery. I'll be back to check in.",
        "Lizzie: Okay.",
        "Remy: Okay, let me know if you need anything, all right? Or if you have trouble with him.",

        "Harley: Good day, everyone. I would like to start by thanking my staff, my colleagues, my department heads and the bean counters, of course, and the chemists, and middle management, and the salespeople. I always knew that Spaulding was filled with the best of the best, but until you see all of you in action it really is a sight to behold. Thank you all for making this past year a success. You have achieved something very, very special here. The company is wealthier! Both in fact and in spirit and that is thanks to you. You've allowed me to help you reach your full potential and I think in the process you've helped me reach mine. You are a wonderful, talented people and you helped me through one of the darkest times in my life and I don't think I've ever thanked you publicly for that, so, uh... so thank you. You know, when I came here, my mission was to clean this place from top to bottom, to erase its past and everything it had stood for, but what ended up surprising me was how much this company actually changed me. It helped me see what's truly important to me, what's truly in my heart: My family and my friends, the people who bring me joy. Having said that, I can't wait to see what this company does next year. I will, however, be watching that from the sidelines because, as of today, I've decided to tender my resignation as CEO.",

        "Lizzie: How did you hear about Tammy?",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, you know me well enough to know that I don't respond well to questions that sound like accusations.",
        "Lizzie: How?",
        "Alan: Well, to be honest with you, I was here having a check- up.",
        "Lizzie: Oh! Checking up on someone, okay.",
        "Alan: What is your question?",
        "Lizzie: You have a tail, did you know that?",
        "Alan: A what?",
        "Lizzie: Daddy showed it to me. He thought it was funny. He once told me, \"You want to know when granddad's lying? It's every time he opens his mouth.\"",
        "Alan: That sounds like your father.",
        "Lizzie: He was right. And you're the reason that Tammy's in the hospital.",
        "Alan: Me?",
        "Lizzie: You couldn't stand that they could help me. That they wanted to help me. That me and my baby's life might not depend on you.",
        "Alan: You're lashing out and are upset with me just because your friend is hurt, but, I assure you, I would do nothing to hurt Tammy.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, really?",
        "Alan: The trouble seems to follow her ever since Randall came on the scene.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, I've had enough! Look, I know better than to tell you to mind your own business, but you better hear this: I am not a kid anymore, Granddad. And you're not bigger than life.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth. How much do you really care about your friends?",
        "Lizzie: What?",
        "Alan: The choice is yours. Either you come home with me, or you will be responsible for what happens to your friends next.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: If you really want to keep me out of here, you'd better call up a lot of security. What did he do to you? You ever wish you didn't meet me? Huh? Life could have been like you thought it would. Go to school, get a job, meet a nice guy, no drama, instead of this. Cousins, vendettas, babies that aren't yours, and Alan Spaulding... this isn't going to stop us.",
        "Nurse: Mrs. Winslow. You can come in.",
        "Cassie: Have they told you anything? Have the doctors told you anything at all?",
        "Jonathan: Uh-uh. Nothing.",
        "Cassie: Thank you for being here.",
        "Josh: Where else would I be?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Billy, all this nonsense about you not being enough for me, it's got to stop. I don't want to hear it.",
        "Billy: What, you're not going to let me wallow in self-pity, is that it?",
        "Reva: Not for a second.",
        "Billy: Darling, I'm just so angry that I can't help you, that I failed you.",
        "Reva: Billy, stop it. You have given me something more important than bone marrow. These past few weeks you've been here for me. You've given me love, you've given me support.",
        "Billy: Okay. Back in Springfield, when we first decided to keep this quiet from everybody, we made a deal, no? We decided if things got bad and Joshua has to know, then all bets are off.",
        "Reva: So you want to tell Joshua so that you don't feel guilty about destroying your bones when I could have used them.",
        "Billy: No--",
        "Reva: No, Billy. You want to make things right by 'fessing up to Josh because that's your M.O. Who do you always turn to when you want absolution or acceptance, or forgiveness? Joshua. The only problem is, you haven't done anything wrong. Well, I'm not ready for Joshua or anyone else. I'm not going to take his life away from him, not yet. I'm going to beat this thing--",
        "Colin: Reva, wake up. It's over. Not your life, but the way you've been living it. We need to find you a donor, quickly. You and Billy need to get on the phone, call all the relatives you've got and ask them to be tested and see if we can find you a match. Play time is over, Reva. We've tried it your way, now it's time to kick things up to a much higher gear. Nobody beats cancer without help, not even the fabulous Reva Shayne.",
        "Billy: Sweetie, you got to call Cassie, you got to call Shayne and Marah, and Dylan, Jonathan, Rusty, Roxie...",
        "Reva: Billy, don't do this.",
        "Billy: Sweetie, hey... look, I'm going to be right here with you. Now, we all know the first call has got to be to him.",
        "Reva: I told you once and I will keep telling you until I lose every hair on my body, Billy. Joshua isn't going to know. I'm the one who has cancer, not him.",
        "Billy: Great. Joshua doesn't have cancer, but, darling, you're killing him just the same. Wait, you don't get it. You do not have any more choices. What do you want? Do you want to live... or do you want to die?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: I know what you're thinking: \"She's done this before.\" (Chuckles) I have to be honest and say, I didn't wake up this morning thinking I was going to throw away the keys to the kingdom, so to speak, but I don't think I ever had those keys, and it's not really my kingdom, anyway. I will say I think I've made an impact on Spaulding, and because of Spaulding I've been able to make an impact in the larger world. I'm proud of that, and Spaulding has made an impact on me. So thank you. Thank you all for supporting me, following me, listening to me. I... I will leave this company in very, very trustworthy hands. So allow me now to name my successor, the person who will take this company into a bold, new future.",

        "Josh: It's Reva.",
        "Cassie: Answer it. It's not about us, Josh, at least not right now. Answer it, you'll regret it if you don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: When I ask you to do something, I expect you to do what we agreed upon.",
        "Manny: I understand, Mr. Spaulding. We were all lined up to get the girl out of town quick and easy.",
        "Alan: That is what I paid for.",
        "Manny: It's just that--",
        "Alan: I don't-- look, I don't want any excuses. You almost ruined everything. But even though you were incompetent, it seems that our message has gotten across.",

        "Harley: And let me assure you, I leave Spaulding in the best of hands. So now, let me announce my successor.",
        "Alan: It's a terrible thing that happened to Tammy. You know, Jonathan, Springfield's getting more dangerous every day.",
