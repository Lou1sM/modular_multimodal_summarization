        "Bill: Oh, is that right? Now, why would you be looking at my butt, olivia?",
        "Olivia: Well, i was just wondering if there's anything else you need help with.",
        "Bill: Well, as a matter of fact, I've got some windows that could be washed.",
        "Phillip: Well, well, well. If it's not my wife and the guy that's not seeing her anymore.",
        "Danny: Tony? Tony! Thank you. Thank you. I know that I didn't deserve it, but thank you for giving me a second chance, and a third, and a fourth. You're my home, baby, and i will always find my way back to you. Always.",
        "Michelle: We can't help but find our way back to each other. I mean, there's no fighting it, really, because in the end, there's nowhere else that we can be but together.",

        "father ray: Looks like I came to the right place. (Music playing)",
        "tony: Michelle? Yo, michelle, hey!",

        "Tony: Yeah, yeah. Try that, see what happens.",
        "Michelle: Yeah?",
        "Tony: I was trying to reach you, michelle, all right? Did you get my message?",

        "Tony: I'm serious.",
        "Michelle: So am i. So am I. That's what I love about being here, okay? Nobody can tell me what I can or can't do. I do whatever I want. And right now I want you to take your shirt off. This portion of \"guiding light\" is sponsored by pantene pro V. That's the beauty of health.",
        "alan: Well, good morning, elizabeth. I'm glad to see your buoyant mood hasn't abated.",
        "Lizzie: No, and i don't plan for it to.",
        "Alan: You've been in this mood ever since you returned from the dance. Any particular reason why?",
        "Lizzie: No. No reason.",
        "Alan: Yeah. Well, let's keep it that way. I don't want it to ever interfere with your work, you know.",
        "Lizzie: No. I couldn't be more focused on my project.",
        "Alan: Ah. That's it. Keep it that way. Now, look. I want everybody to make themselves at home, but I've got a few phone calls to make before we start the meeting.",
        "Kyra: Good morning, mr. Spaulding.",
        "Alan: We'll see.",
        "Shayne: Great. What's up with him?",
        "Lizzie: I don't know. He wouldn't tell me either.",
        "Kyra: Well, it can't have anything to do with the pitches, because that's not until next week.",
        "Remy: What's not until next week?",
        "Shayne: Hey, guys. Our new project pitches.",
        "Lizzie: Thank god.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, it must be hard concentrating on work after that horrible experience you had after the dance.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, it is.",
        "Remy: Did they ever find the guys who were hassling you?",
        "Lizzie: No.",
        "Tammy: From looking at you you'd never know that anything had happened at all.",
        "Lizzie: That's because I've had support from all my friends, especially joey. He's been a doll. What am I telling you that for? You know what a great guy he is.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, I do.",
        "Shayne: Miss spaulding, do you think we could ask your cook to make us some coffee?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. What would you like, latte, cappuccino, cafe mocha, what?",
        "Shayne: No, just regular coffee's fine.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. Coming right up.",
        "Shayne: All right.",
        "Lizzie: Excuse me.",
        "Tammy: Oh, I cannot believe what lizzie gets away with.",
        "Remy: You still think she made up that whole story about those guys attacking her?",
        "Kyra: Do you really think she'd lie about something like that?",
        "Tammy: To get joey's attention? Yeah. She got him to take her home after the dance. But before he did, we talked, and he was so sweet.",
        "Shayne: Hey, joe.",
        "Tammy: Hi. I was just...",
        "Bill: Well, it's got to be fun being you, phillip, huh?",
        "Phillip: Sometimes.",
        "Bill: Yeah, i'm sure. It's like you're the king of the sandbox, right? The kid who just doesn't want to share any of his toys. Not that you have any interest in them. Maybe just want to prove that you can do it.",
        "Phillip: Those are deep thoughts, bill. Olivia, I believe your young friend just referred to you as a toy.",
        "Olivia: Just save it, phillip. You're embarrassing both of us.",
        "Phillip: Am i? I'm sorry.",
        "Bill: Well, this has been fun. I'm sure you lovebirds need a little alone time, so I'm going to take off.",
        "Olivia: Mission accomplished. You can leave now.",
        "Phillip: Not yet. Come here. Slap me.",
        "Olivia: What?",
        "Phillip: Do it, and make it look good.",
        "Olivia: That'll be hard.",
        "Bill: Ouch. Remind me never to get married.",
        "Olivia: Get a life phillip, preferably one that doesn't include stalking me.",
        "Phillip: Well, if i'm following you, i must have a reason.",
        "Olivia: There's nothing going on between bill and me.",
        "Phillip: So you're not the one giving it to him?",
        "Olivia: No more than I'm giving it to you.",
        "Phillip: Information, olivia. Company secrets. Someone is leaking them to lewis construction.",
        "Olivia: I'm not giving bill anything.",
        "Phillip: Okay, bill.",
        "Bill: Hmm?",
        "Phillip: Look, you're not getting it from my wife. Where are you getting your inside information?",
        "Bill: Sorry. Who says i am?",
        "Phillip: Well, how else could you have stolen that waterfront property right out from under our nose?",
        "Bill: Maybe i'm a better businessman.",
        "Phillip: Or maybe my wife gave you something that wasn't hers to give.",
        "Bill: The property's mine, phillip, just like the mall that tony and i are going to build. It's mine. So it looks like lewis two, spaulding, zip. Have a good day.",
        "Phillip: And it's only round one. Ho can i lose with you on my side?",
        "Olivia: If we're done, I'm leaving.",
        "Phillip: Yeah, you can go. We're done for now.",
        "Tony: Michelle, michelle, what are you doing?",
        "Michelle: I want to look at your tattoos.",
        "Tony: Why?",
        "Michelle: Let me see your tattoos.",
        "Tony: No. Why? I don't understand.",
        "Michelle: Are you going to let me see them?",
        "Tony: No. I'm sorry, i'm not. No.",
        "Michelle: What's the point of getting a tattoo if you're not going to let anyone see them? Come on.",
        "Tony: Michelle, please, come on. This is not... Okay, okay, okay. I'll do it. All right. There. You happy?",
        "Michelle: Wow. So why'd you do it? I mean, why'd you get the tattoos?",
        "Tony: Because i was tired of doing what everybody else thought I should do. I wanted to do something that made me happy. Something I wanted to do, all right? That's why.",
        "Michelle: Did it hurt?",
        "Tony: A little, yeah, it did.",
        "Michelle: You got any more?",
        "Tony: I guess, a couple. Maybe more to go.",
        "Michelle: Wow. You got a lot of them, huh?",
        "Tony: Like I said, I guess. Maybe some more to come.",
        "Michelle: So tell me about this one.",
        "Tony: This is an ancient cross that i designed with the years that my father lived. Yeah. And this means father.",
        "Michelle: Do you miss your dad?",
        "Tony: Honestly, i was young. I don't remember much.",
        "Michelle: And how about this one?",
        "Tony: Strength, health, and bravery.",
        "Michelle: Bravery and strength. So macho.",
        "Tony: So I'm assuming you're going to want to know what these two mean down there, right?",
        "Michelle: Mm-hmm.",
        "Tony: Okay. Tranquillity or peace, okay? This is a band that was designed. Love, eternity, and unity connected by a diamond on the back-- strongest stone. I guess the yin and yang are pretty much equally represented, don't you think?",
        "Michelle: And this one?",
        "Tony: My life depends on you.",
        "Michelle: Who?",
        "Tony: Who what?",
        "Michelle: Who does your life depend on?",
        "Tony: Me. Michelle, I'm the only one that decides how I'm going to live my life.",
        "Michelle: That's what i want.",
        "Tony: Yeah?",
        "Michelle: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And that's the reason I come here, and why I love this place, and why I could buy this chair. It doesn't fit anywhere else in my life, but it fits perfect here, because I chose it. Not for the other michelle, not to please danny, not to please anybody else but me.",
        "Tony: Well, you know, michelle, you've got to do what makes you happy.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, well, i can't do that out there, because, you know, everybody's watching.",
        "Tony: This is your place. Come here.",
        "Michelle: I just... I don't want danny to know. It's not like I'm shutting him out or anything. It just makes it... It's just... It's easier.",
        "Tony: I won't tell him.",
        "Michelle: Thanks.",
        "Father ray: You shouldn't be here, danny.",
        "Danny: Why not? You're here. Tony practically lives here. Apparently my wife likes to come here now.",
        "Father ray: Michelle?",
        "Danny: Yeah, but she won't tell me that. I had to find out from my good friend jeffrey o'neill.",
        "Father ray: Are you made because she was here or because she didn't tell you?",
        "Danny: I don't know. I'm going crazy, ray, having her but not having her. I look for the old michelle, but she's nowhere to be found. I try to reach out to the new one, but she just slips between my fingers.",
        "Father ray: Maybe you're trying too hard. Back off a little bit.",
        "Danny: I can'T.",
        "Father ray: You said yourself what you're doing isn't working..",
        "Danny: I have to get her back. I have to.",
        "Father ray: Danny...",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Father ray: I know you feel responsible for what happened, but...",
        "Danny: Ray, ray, I am responsible.",
        "Father ray: It was an accident. The police said...",
        "Danny: The police don't know anything. I blew up that building, ray.",
        "Father ray: You?",
        "Danny: It was all part of a plan set up by o'neill and the feds. So michelle doesn't remember me or our life together. And what makes it worse is that i don't think she wants to remember.",
        "Alan: Anything interesting?",
        "Lizzie: Grandpa, come here. Don't sneak up on me like that.",
        "Alan: That wasn't my intention, elizabeth. I just saw you preoccupied there, and... What, are they planning on overthrowing the company or something?",
        "Lizzie: No, they're talking about getting their coffee.",
        "Alan: Of course. What was i thinking? What were you doing in here?",
        "Lizzie: I was just checking the temperature in the room.",
        "Alan: Really? Well, I'm glad to hear that someone in this family listens to what I have to say.",
        "Lizzie: I always do, and it always pays off.",
        "Alan: Well, good.",
        "Lizzie: So are you ready to go in there yet?",
        "Alan: In a few minutes. I have one other call to make.",
        "Lizzie: It's all right. Just take your time. There's no rush. I just hope that we're not taking too much of your time with this project.",
        "Alan: No. As a matter of fact, i... The big reason i'm doing this is because of you, and I hope that you're getting something out of this.",
        "Lizzie: I'm getting more out of this than you ever will understand.",
        "Alan: Good.",
        "Joey: Do you have any idea why mr. Spaulding called the meeting?",
        "Shayne: Maybe he's going to switch up teams again. And maybe this time you'll get paired with tammy.",
        "Joey: No way, man. If we do i am out of here. The scholarship wouldn't be worth it.",
        "Shayne: That's a little harsh.",
        "Joey: Harsh? You should hear the stuff she's saying about me.",
        "Shayne: Well, it looked like you guys were all good yesterday. I mean, you were dancing.",
        "Joey: Yeah, well, that's what i thought, and then I heard she's talking trash behind my back.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, she's talking trash. And who told you that? Lizzie, right?",
        "Joey: No. I heard it from myself.",
        "Shayne: Listen, joey, you know what you need to do? You need to talk to her and just straighten this out, okay?",
        "Joey: Why, shayne? So she can lie behind my back again and just get away with it? There's no way. Tammy and I are done, dude.",
        "Tammy: Hey. Can we talk for a second.",
        "Joey: I have nothing to say.",
        "Tammy: I do.",
        "Joey: Okay, well, good. Talk to someone who cares.",
        "Tammy: I thought you did.",
        "Joey: Yeah. I guess we all make mistakes when it comes to reading people, huh?",
        "Lizzie: Tammy, are you okay?",
        "Tammy: I'm fine.",
        "Lizzie: Good, because there's something I need to tell you. It's about joey. I know you two were talking.",
        "Tammy: Lizzie, if you have something to say, just say it.",
        "Lizzie: You're right. I should be mature about it. All right. Joey kissed me last night.",
        "Josh: Hello, bill.",
        "Bill: Let me call you back, all right?",
        "Josh: Wanda told me i would find you here.",
        "Bill: Well, she never could keep a secret. What's going on? There a problem?",
        "Josh: There was a problem, but I fixed it.",
        "Bill: What do you mean? That's my job.",
        "Josh: Normally it would be, yes, but then I heard about this partnership you have going on with tony, so I figured I'd better get involved.",
        "Bill: So what, you talked with tony?",
        "Josh: Yeah. Well, I talked. He threatened.",
        "Bill: Really?",
        "Josh: Mm-hmm.",
        "Bill: Oh.",
        "Josh: See, I know tony. I know all about him, and i thought I had an understanding worked out with him, but evidently I was mistaken.",
        "Bill: Well, wait a minute now, uncle josh. Maybe you just misunderstood.",
        "Josh: No, he was very clear about what he was saying.",
        "Bill: I mean, i don't understand. What did you say that got him so riled up?",
        "Josh: I told him there was no chance whatsoever that you were going to go into business with him.",
        "Olivia: Michelle?",
        "Michelle: Yeah?",
        "Olivia: Wow, you really don't remember. What a kick.",
        "Michelle: Let me guess. We worked together at the hospital. Or we were college roommates, best friends.",
        "Olivia: No. No, no, no, no. I'm olivia spencer spaulding. I don't have friends.",
        "Michelle: Ah, then we've got something in common. Neither do i.",
        "Olivia: Oh. Well, you lost your memory, but gained a sense of humor. I'd take that trade.",
        "Michelle: I like you, olivia spaulding.",
        "Olivia: Mm-hmm. Well, you'd be one of the few. Most people in this town considev me to be a manipulative, back-stabbing, husband-stealing witch.",
        "Michelle: That's an honest answer. I think we both just found a new friend.",
        "Father ray: Man, you've just got to give her some time.",
        "Danny: How much time, ray? A month, a year? Ten years? What if she never remembers me, or robbie, or our life?",
        "Father ray: Then you build a new life.",
        "Danny: How? How am i going to do that?",
        "Father ray: Do you love her?",
        "Danny: How do i do that?",
        "Father ray: Do you really love her as she is now?",
        "Danny: Of course I do. I love michelle no matter what. You know that.",
        "Father ray: And you accept her just as she is, no matter what?",
        "Danny: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Father ray: Then don't let anything stand in your way.",
        "Danny: You're right. I know, you're right. You're right. I can't let anything get between us. I can'T.",
        "Father ray: Hey, br.",
        "Tony: Ray, how you doing? What is this, a family reunion? Didn't get the invitation.",
        "Danny: Why didn't you tell m e that michelle has been coming here?",
        "Tony: Well, you know what? It's not my job, danny, to keep tabs on michelle. I didn't get that memo either.",
        "Danny: Well, I don't want her coming around here anymore, you understand?",
        "Tony: So tell her, not me.",
        "Danny: I'm telling you, tony.",
        "Tony: Danny, I didn't invite her here, all right?",
        "Danny: What, you're telling me that she just showed up on her own?",
        "Tony: Yeah, that's how it happened. You know what? Why don't you ask yourself one thing, danny.",
        "Danny: What's that?",
        "Tony: Why did she leave you and come looking for me? Coming up on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Tammy: You didn't make out with joey last night. But you did do something to make him hate me. I want to know what it was. I think about you, too, all the time. Jacksonand I'm david lamb \u00d1 \u00f1 &",
        "Tammy: Joey kissed you?",
        "Lizzie: Tammy, I knew it would hurt you, but I thought you had the right to know.",
        "Alan: Ladies, ladies, it's time to get started. Come on. Please, please be seated. Glad to see that you all made it on time. Now, for your final two challenges, it will be every man for himself.",
        "Lizzie: No more teams?",
        "Alan: No, elizabeth, no more teams. You will each be given $100 to start your own business. Now, you can combine your efforts with one of your teammates if you choose, but remember, that could be very risky. Now, at the end of one week, the person who has the greatest return on his investment will be the winner of the first challenge.",
        "Kyra: What's the second challenge?",
        "Alan: One step at a time. I will tell you what the second challenge is when I'm ready to. Now, go out and make money.",
        "Tammy: We need to talk in private.",
        "Lizzie: Fine. Okay, what is it?",
        "Tammy: You didn't make out with joey last night, but you did do something to make him hate me. I want to know what it was.",
        "Bill: All right, wait a minute, now, uncle josh. Come on, we had a deal.",
        "Josh: Yes, we did. You make the decisions, but you clear them with your dad and me first.",
        "Bill: Yeah, but you knew i was working with tony.",
        "Josh: I did, but not to what extent.",
        "Bill: Now you do. What's the problem?",
        "Josh: The problem is the way tony does business.",
        "Bill: Uncle josh, you have a problem with turning a big profit?",
        "Josh: Bill, are you ever in there somewhere? Because I don't see you right now.",
        "Bill: Yes, I am right here, and I'm bringing in more money for lewis construction that i ever thought possible.",
        "Josh: Yeah, i understand. I get that. What you've been doing the last few months has been terrific. But there's a limit.",
        "Bill: No, see, that's where you're wrong, josh. There are no limits. There are only possibilities. And if you're going to realize them, then you've got to think big.",
        "Josh: All right. I'm all up for possibilities. I like the idea of expanding our horizons. That's exactly why i'm bringing danny santos in on a project that we're doing.",
        "Bill: No, i'm not going to work with him.",
        "Josh: Yes, you will.",
        "Bill: No, i'm not.",
        "Josh: If he accepts my deal, you will work with him.",
        "Michelle: Okay, okay. Wait a minute. So wait. You're married to phillip now. Before that you were married to his dad. And then before that it was josh lewis, and somewhere in there you were engaged to a prince. Were you ever with danny?",
        "Olivia: No.",
        "Michelle: Just checking.",
        "Olivia: No. No, it's okay. Sometimes I need a scorecard to keep up with my men.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, i can kind of see why you got the husband- stealer comment. But what about the rest? How'd you earn those titles?",
        "Olivia: I guess i've used a few people to get what i've wanted.",
        "Michelle: So you're ambitious.",
        "Olivia: You have to be to get what you want in life.",
        "Michelle: Is that what you do? You go after what you want?",
        "Olivia: It's the only way to guarantee that i'm going to get it. So you still want to be friends?",
        "Michelle: I could learn a lot from you.",
        "Danny: Tony, this is not some kind of childhood competition. Nobody's keeping score here. This is about protecting michelle.",
        "Tony: Protecting michelle, right?",
        "Danny: I am willing to do that.",
        "Tony: You know what's funny, danny? You don't know michelle. And that scares you to death, and you know that.",
        "Danny: Tony, you don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Tony: I don't, no?",
        "Danny: No, you don'T.",
        "Tony: No, really? Where is she, danny? Where is your wife, danny?",
        "Father ray: Back off! What are you doing? Come on.",
        "Danny: Just stay away from michelle, tony. Stay away from her.",
        "Tony: He's crazy.",
        "Lizzie: What do you think i did, cast a spell on joey, or what?",
        "Tammy: I wouldn't put it past you.",
        "Lizzie: Look, tammy, I know this hurts you, but I hope we can still be friends after this.",
        "Tammy: Friends don't steal each other's boyfriends.",
        "Lizzie: I didn't steal joey.",
        "Tammy: Please. You've been trying to break us up for months, and now you finally succeeded when you decided to tell joey that i kissed edmund.",
        "Lizzie: What? I thought he knew.",
        "Tammy: You're a liar. Oh, I can't believe I wasted one second trying to be friends with you.",
        "Lizzie: You know what, tammy? If you were capable of being a real friend, you'd see that joey and I had a chance at something real. You of all people should know what that means to me.",
        "Tammy: So because you've had this tough life, i should just hand joey over to you?",
        "Lizzie: Well, you know what? You could bow out graciously, couldn't you?",
        "Tammy: You're right, you're right. How selfish of me to try and stand between you and my boyfriend.",
        "Lizzie: He isn't your boyfriend.",
        "Tammy: Oh, and you think he's yours?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, he will be.",
        "Alan: Well, olivia...",
        "Olivia: Alan, what are you doing here?",
        "Alan: It's a public park.",
        "Olivia: I know. I was just surprised. Look, don't leave on my account, all right? I was about to give up my bench anyway. Have a seat.",
        "Alan: Well, thank you. I just came from a meeting with the young people. You know, the intern project we started at spauding.",
        "Olivia: Yes, spaulding enterprises, shaping the next generation of young minds.",
        "Alan: Mm-hmm. Well, I regret to say I don't think there's a future executive among them.",
        "Olivia: Well, whatever. They'll survive, you know? They have their whole lives ahead of them to see what they want to be, who they are, and if they don't like their first choice, then they'll find something else. You know, they're lucky.",
        "Alan: You say that as if you no longer have any choices in your life.",
        "Olivia: Well, i am a parent, and as wonderful as it is, it changes things. I was just sitting there thinking of a fresh start, you know? I ran into michelle bauer... Met her, the new michelle bauer, post-accident, and she didn't remember me. It's weird. She actually like me better than the old michelle did. I was just thinking about what it must be like to start over, that's all.",
        "Alan: Well, people do it all the time.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, but not in the same way, you know? Michelle doesn't lie in bed at night thinking about her mistakes, and having all those memories.",
        "Alan: Well, who would we be without memories and mistakes, olivia? After all, they're what shape us to who we really are.",
        "Olivia: See, that's funny coming from you, because you have a rather selective memory, and you never admit to making a mistake.",
        "Alan: I think michelle is going to be just fine. Danny's a very devoted husband.",
        "Olivia: Well, maybe one day i'll find one of those, and my troubles will all disappear.",
        "Alan: Phillip's very devoted to the people he loves.",
        "Olivia: Well, right now he's devoted to making my life miserable. He was one of the first minds that you shaped, wasn't he? My goodness, you must be very proud.",
        "Danny: Michelle, would you call me, please? I just want to know you're okay. Can I get a beer, please? Thank you.",
        "Phillip: Danny! How's springfield's big hero?",
        "Danny: He's not in the mood.",
        "Phillip: Oh, okay. No hero talk, then.",
        "Danny: Nope.",
        "Phillip: How's business? Got any new development plans down on fifth street?",
        "Danny: Actually, I've got a couple other things going on in the works.",
        "Phillip: Really?",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Phillip: I thought that was your number-one priority.",
        "Danny: No, michelle is my number-one priority.",
        "Phillip: Of course. That's completely understandable. How's she doing?",
        "Danny: She's fine.",
        "Phillip: Yeah? Has she gotten any of her memory back?",
        "Danny: No, not yet, but she will, in time.",
        "Phillip: Sounds like it could be a long haul.",
        "Danny: Is there a point, phillip?",
        "Phillip: Well, no, just that i think that you're to be commended. I think a lot of guys in your shoes would already be thinking about packing it in by now.",
        "Danny: Men like you, I guess.",
        "Phillip: Ouch. Well, I guess, you know, it is true i've become a bit more pragmatic about these things. I'm no longer a big believer in fate and destiny, soul mates.",
        "Danny: Explains all the marriages.",
        "Phillip: Yeah, I guess it would. It either works or it doesn't, but it pays to be prepared for either outcome.",
        "Danny: Phillip, i'm sorry, i don't think you're the person to be giving me relationship advice.",
        "Phillip: Well, danny, on the contrary, if there's one thing i do know about, it's relationships.",
        "Michelle: Danny, hey.",
        "Danny: Michelle.",
        "Michelle: Hey, guess what? Met a new friend today.",
        "Danny: Really?",
        "Michelle: Yeah. Yeah. Olivia. She's your wife, right?",
        "Phillip: Yes, olivia is my wife.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, she's something, huh?",
        "Phillip: She is something.",
        "Danny: Michelle, I ran into reva and robbie at the beacon.",
        "Michelle: Oh, you're okay with her watching robbie, right? I just needed a little space.",
        "Danny: Yeah, it's fine. I... They were both having a great time.",
        "Michelle: Good. You know what? Then i'm going to go... I'll go pick them up. I'll meet you at home, all right?",
        "Danny: Well, hold up. I'm done here, so I'll walk out with you, okay? Take care, phillip.",
        "Phillip: You too, danny. Good to see you. Good to see you, michelle.",
        "Michelle: You, too. And tell olivia I had fun talking to her.",
        "Phillip: I'll tell her.",
        "Josh: That's for you.",
        "Bill: What is this?",
        "Josh: It's an offer on the lakefront property we're selling. We're going to focus all our energies on this new project with danny santos.",
        "Bill: No, we are not.",
        "Josh: Yes, we are. We're selling that property whether you like it or not.",
        "Bill: Well, you can't, because it's in my name. Here you go.",
        "Josh: You were planning on going through with this deal no matter what your dad and i said, weren't you? You know, I could fire you right now. I should.",
        "Bill: Yeah?",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Bill: Well, you know what? Let me save you the trouble, because I quit.",
        "Josh: Really?",
        "Bill: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And this time for real.",
        "Josh: Again?",
        "Bill: No, really, i'm sick of it. You and my dad, all you do is question every move I make. You don't trust me anymore. It's not worth it, uncle josh. It's not worth it.",
        "Josh: You're making a mistake.",
        "Bill: We'll see.",
        "Olivia: Wow. I have to tell you, that was impressive.",
        "Bill: What do you want, olivia?",
        "Olivia: To congratulate you. That was the best move you ever made.",
        "Bill: No, this is.",
        "Olivia: Good, you're still here. Did you have a nice lunch?",
        "Phillip: Why, did you poison it?",
        "Olivia: No, of course not.",
        "Phillip: Well, why the good mood?",
        "Olivia: I have good news.",
        "Phillip: Okay, tell me.",
        "Olivia: Bill has quit lewis construction effective immediately.",
        "Phillip: Hmm. And you think that that means that you no longer have a job spying on him for me.",
        "Olivia: Well, how could he be stealing secrets for lewis if he isn't working there?",
        "Phillip: Bill is of interest to me until I say he is no longer of interest to me. I'd say I'm sorry I ruined your day, but of course, I'm not.",
        "Joey: So what did tammy want?",
        "Lizzie: Nothing. Just girl stuff, you know?",
        "Joey: I thought maybe she would want to talk about me.",
        "Lizzie: It must have been really hard seeing her, you know, after knowing what all she said about you.",
        "Joey: Ah, it was no biggie.",
        "Lizzie: Look, joey, it's not true, okay, what tammy said about you being a loser. I think you're great. You're really special, you know that? And when you kissed me last night, it was amazing.",
        "Joey: Lizzie, this you and me thing, it's not good.",
        "Lizzie: I think it is.",
        "Joey: Look, my head's really messed up right now, and all i really need is a friend. You cool with that?",
        "Lizzie: A friend, yeah. Sure.",
        "Joey: All right. Well, I'm going to get going. Oh, my friend J.T. Wants to borrow that cd i lent you. Do you think you could give it back?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, yeah. It's upstairs in my room. I'll go get it.",
        "Joey: Thanks. Find it? Tam...",
        "Tammy: I forgot my bag.",
        "Joey: Here.",
        "Tammy: Thank you. I need to ask you something. I want you to be honest. Last night after you said that you missed me and you wanted us to get back together, did you come back here and kiss lizzie?",
        "Joey: Yeah, i did.",
        "Tammy: So you didn't mean any of those things that you said?",
        "Joey: Do you always say what you mean, tammy?",
        "Tammy: Yeah, including this. I never want to see you again.",
        "Danny: You're sure? Okay. How much overdrawn am I? All right. Okay. Well, I'll transfer some money from another account, and it'll be there first thing in the morning. Yeah. No, it's not a problem at all. I apologize for the oversight. Mm-hmm. All right. Thanks.",
        "Michelle: Everything okay?",
        "Danny: Yeah, fine. How's robbie?",
        "Michelle: He's out like a light. I mean, he and reva must have had a blast, because he couldn't even make it through one book.",
        "Danny: Good. How about you? Did you have a good day?",
        "Michelle: Yeah. Yeah, sure.",
        "Danny: You find a chair you like?",
        "Michelle: Oh, you know, i'm thinking i could probably just get used to this one. Yeah, it's not that bad.",
        "Danny: Michelle, you know you can tell me anything, right?",
        "Michelle: I know that.",
        "Danny: Right. Including telling me to back off. I'm serious. If you feel like you need a break, you just let me know. You don't have to run off.",
        "Michelle: You are upset that i left robbie with reva.",
        "Danny: I'm not upset. I'm not. It's just... Look, if you feel like the walls are closing in, let me know. Maybe I can help you with that.",
        "Michelle: Maybe.",
        "Danny: All right. I know that a lot of this you have to do on your own. I do. But some of it i can help you with.",
        "Michelle: You know what? I am beat, so I'm going to head upstairs, okay?",
        "Danny: Sure.",
        "Michelle: I feel like i never stop picking these toys up.",
        "Danny: What is that? Turn around. You got a tattoo?",
        "Tony: Michelle, michelle, michelle, no.",
        "Michelle: I know you want me, tony. I can feel your eyes looking at me when I'm not looking, memorizing every curve of my body. I think about you, too, all the time.",
