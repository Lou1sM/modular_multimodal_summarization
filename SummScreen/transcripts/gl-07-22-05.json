        "Dinah: Cassie, I'm serious. I need you to wait outside. Please.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Dinah, look, what's going on? We've done this before. Why are you so jittery?",
        "Dinah: I'm not jittery! I told you, I don't like this. I am not liking people looking at me. It makes me feel uncomfortable.",
        "Cassie: You need to relax a little bit.",
        "Dinah: I don't need to relax because you tell me to relax!",
        "Cassie: Okay. Dinah, it's my baby, okay? And I just want to see my baby and I just want to feel my baby.",
        "Dinah: Your baby's not kicking right now.",
        "Cassie: Sometimes if you touch the baby it will move a little bit.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Hey, it's me. I know you just left, but I just wanted to call and say hello. And I'm glad we're back on track. And we're going to stay that way, you know. Nothing... no one is going to mess it up. Anyway, just give me a call whenever you can. I'll be setting up for the shower. I love you. I really do.",
        "Blake: Hi.",
        "Tammy: Hi, Blake.",
        "Blake: That sounded nice. Did you mean it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: You know, honey, I was thinking that the house needed some work. But actually it's starting to grow on me.",
        "Gus: Hmm. You like bare walls, huh?",
        "Harley: I like bare something.",
        "Gus: ( Laughs ) All right. I like the sound of that.",
        "Harley: An empty house never felt so full.",
        "Gus: Our life is pretty full.",
        "Harley: Except, I think the boys would like more stuff in their rooms, probably.",
        "Gus: I've been meaning to talk to you about that. That's going to be your job. You've got to pick out windows and doors and moldings.",
        "Harley: I get to pick out the moldings?",
        "Gus: That's fun, right?",
        "Harley: Late-night shopping trips at the home store.",
        "Gus: Exactly.",
        "Harley: ( Laughs )",
        "Gus: Does that turn you on?",
        "Harley: Normal turns me on.",
        "Gus: All right. You want some normal? I like tiled countertops.",
        "Harley: I never thought I'd heard the words.",
        "Gus: Everyone's doing chrome it's overrated.",
        "Harley: Can I tell you this? Tile is hard to keep clean.",
        "Gus: Grout.",
        "Harley: I used to dream about these conversations in prison.",
        "Gus: This ain't a dream. This is your life, sister.",
        "Harley: Normal. I'll take it.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Things will be a lot easier for you if you just cooperate, Alan.",
        "Alan: I'm not saying a word to you until I speak with my attorney.",
        "Jeffrey: You already confessed.",
        "Alan: According to ten people who hate me.",
        "Jeffrey: I don't hate you.",
        "Alan: That's touching. Let's play tennis together. Why don't I call my secretary and get you penciled in.",
        "Jeffrey: That's a nice offer, but you won't be able to make any social engagements for the next 20 years or so.",
        "Alan: I'm not going to prison.",
        "Jeffrey: You killed your son, Alan, the case is airtight.",
        "Alan: Don't underestimate me.",
        "Jeffrey: Speaking of tight, I do know how you feel about confined spaces. I can only imagine what it must be like for you thinking about the possibility of spending such a long time, the rest of your life, really, in such a tight, confined, enclosed, dark space. Of course I could be of help if there's anything you feel like telling me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: And the couch is gonna go right here.",
        "Gus: Yeah? That's okay. Because the flat screen's going here. A nice big flat screen.",
        "Harley: Boys and their flat screen TVs. You can't get much more normal than that.",
        "Gus: You said normal turns you on, so normal's what you get.",
        "Harley: You promise?",
        "Gus: Cross my heart.",
        "Harley: You know what I want most of all is routine. I just want one day to be just like the one before and the one that's coming up.",
        "Gus: I'll do my best to give you that.",
        "Harley: I know you will. I am so glad we are here.",
        "Harley: This is so great!",
        "Gus: It is, isn't it? I'm going to get you in here as soon as possible, you and the boys.",
        "Harley: Well, what about you?",
        "Gus: What? Oh, is that my invitation? I'll take it.",
        "Harley: I can't have you living out of cars your whole life. Somebody has to put a roof over your head-- once a roof is built on this house. This is a crazy life.",
        "Gus: We're normal now. This is what normal people do.",
        "Harley: Almost. Almost. But it's like you said. It's like our lives... we're like that soap, \"The Light of Love.\"",
        "Gus: Actually, it's \"Light of Love.\" It used to be \"The Light of Love,\" but it's been on so long.",
        "Harley: The point is, it's going to be boring. Get used to it.",
        "Gus: You won't be bored?",
        "Harley: No. I'm Mrs. Normal.",
        "Gus: Let's go?",
        "Harley: The home store.",
        "Harley: Oh! Oh, tonight. I can't do it tonight. I have Cassie's surprised baby shower, which I'm excited about. Which is unusual for me because when I was a kid, well, not even such a kid, a grown-up, I hated those things, showers and party favors and the sandwiches and all those stupid games that you have to play.",
        "Gus: What kind of sandwiches?",
        "Harley: The pinwheel-shaped ones. Anyway, I would never touch them. Give me a sub. But now, bring it on. I want the shower and I want those stupid little party favors and the games and everything. But I just want to sit around and eat sandwiches with my girlfriends.",
        "Gus: That's nice. That's the normal thing to do.",
        "Harley: Except for the part where Dinah's carrying the baby.",
        "Gus: Yeah, that's a little weird.",
        "Harley: But I guess you need something to keep life a little off-balance.",
        "Gus: Compared to what we've been through, that seems normal. So, it's no problem. We'll go to the home store tomorrow.",
        "Harley: Okay.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: I do wish we were coming back here tonight, though.",
        "Gus: We're not going to be cuddling tonight?",
        "Harley: Well, we are, but it's not the same thing at the Bauer house because Frank snores and Rick snores and who knew Mel snored.",
        "Gus: Like a lumberjack.",
        "Harley: I'm ready to build a life for my family. I want my children to have a stable life with a future that's clear and bright.",
        "Gus: Absolutely. Every family should have that.",
        "Harley: Yes.",
        "Gus: All right. I've got to go to some... I've got some business.",
        "Harley: Where are you going?",
        "Gus: It involves our life arrangements, okay? I'll tell you tomorrow. I'll drop you off at the baby bash. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: O'Neill, you can save your scare tactics for the real criminal.",
        "Jeffrey: You're pretty real to me, Alan.",
        "Alan: Can I talk to my attorney or not?",
        "Jeffrey: Talking with me will get you a lot further.",
        "Alan: Oh, I'll bet.",
        "Jeffrey: You know, I can just make a few calls and we'll get a lot done.",
        "Alan: You would do that for me?",
        "Jeffrey: Arrangements can be made. Bigger cell. Do you want to spend the rest of your life in a closet? Those cells can feel like coffins after a while.",
        "Alan: I told you, I am not going to go to prison.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that's where you're going to go. It will be your home for the rest of your life. We'll try to make it as pleasant as possible for you.",
        "Alan: Can I make the call or not?",
        "Jeffrey: Fine. Make your call. If you change your mind...",
        "Alan: If you'll excuse me. Yeah, it's me.",
        "Dr. Emory: Mr. Spaulding, I have been trying to reach you.",
        "Alan: Yeah, well, I've been indisposed.",
        "Dr. Emory: So I've read we feel need to discuss how your situation affects your son. I have concerns.",
        "Alan: You don't worry about that. Just keep doing what you've been doing.",
        "Dr. Emory: That might not be possible.",
        "Alan: What do you mean? I pay you good money.",
        "Dr. Emory: The money is running out.",
        "Alan: Money is not an issue. I am a wealthy man.",
        "Dr. Emory: Will it be if you go to prison?",
        "Alan: I am not going to prison!",
        "Dr. Emory: The newspaper says you confessed to your son's murder.",
        "Alan: You just let me worry about that. You keep doing your job.",
        "Dr. Emory: Fine. Pay me and I'll have no problem with that.",
        "Alan: You will get your money.",
        "Dr. Emory: Sooner or else. Without resources my staff and I will pack up and leave and the subject will be left to fend for himself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: My mom's gonna be here soon. We should start to decorate.",
        "Blake: I'm sorry. That was... that was an obnoxious question. I should haven't asked you.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, it kind of was.",
        "Blake: You know... well, of course you love Sandy, he's a great guy. He's just a great guy.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, he is.",
        "Blake: Please forget I said anything, okay?",
        "Tammy: Did I sound fake on the phone? I mean is that what...",
        "Blake: No, no.",
        "Tammy: I did, didn't I?",
        "Blake: This is none of my business.",
        "Tammy: Blake, I really want to know.",
        "Blake: Okay. Um, you sounded a little rehearsed. I mean, just a little. But that's normal, right? I mean, it's normal. You rehearse something in your head when you're trying to figure out what to say to somebody, right?",
        "Tammy: Right. I mean...",
        "Blake: Look, Tammy, in my business you... you know, being an author, I'm... most of the time I'm... well, all of the time I'm trying to figure out what somebody's thinking and usually I just... I don't know when to stop. So that's all.",
        "Tammy: It's okay.",
        "Blake: Ross says that I create drama.",
        "Tammy: You're a writer. That's what writers do.",
        "Blake: Yeah, well, they're supposed to create drama in their work, not in their lives. Not in other people's lives.",
        "Tammy: Well, my life is pretty simple right now. I'm in school and I work and I've got a great boyfriend.",
        "Blake: Right. And you're expecting a baby brother or sister soon.",
        "Tammy: There you go.",
        "Blake: Good. So how are things with Sandy?",
        "Tammy: Um, they're great. Sandy's great, you know? He's the kind of guy that every girl should want.",
        "Blake: Should want?",
        "Tammy: Chill, Blake. You're over-thinking.",
        "Blake: Actually, what I'm thinking is you are too young to have this much sense. Really. It's great. I have such a poor record when it comes to men.",
        "Tammy: Well, except for Ross.",
        "Blake: Except for Ross.",
        "Tammy: And all the other guys that weren't Ross?",
        "Blake: Let's see, there was Ross' brother.",
        "Tammy: Oh?",
        "Blake: A very sordid affair. You know my problem? It's that I am always attracted to drama. It took a long time to realize that comfort and security can be just as sexy as... you know, the other stuff.",
        "Tammy: What other stuff?",
        "Blake: Okay. Uh-uh. Your mother would so not want me to be your relationship counselor. You know, honey, be happy that you found a good guy. They are rare. They're hard to come by and the other ones, they just... oh, wow it... is there someone...",
        "Tammy: No! Hey, you know what? I should make sure that my mom is on her way. Can you just finish things up?",
        "Blake: Sure. Tammy? Never mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Cassie... I thought we agreed that I'd stay with Dinah during the sonogram.",
        "Cassie: Why are you trying to get rid of me?",
        "Edmund: I'm not. I'm not. I just... I don't want to upset Dinah. You can see how emotional she is.",
        "Cassie: I see something but what is going on?",
        "Edmund: Well, I just... just give me a few minutes, Cassie, and I can make her relax.",
        "Cassie: You guys are acting really weird, you know?",
        "Edmund: No, no. I'm just trying to do the responsible thing for the baby, that's all. Please, just a moment.",
        "Cassie: Okay, but this is my baby and I want to see it and I'm not going anywhere until I see my baby on this sonogram.",
        "Edmund: Of course. Of course. Just a moment.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Next time I won't miss.",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie?",
        "Cassie: Hey!",
        "Jeffrey: Hi.",
        "Cassie: You look nice. And flowers. You bought me flowers?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: Wow. What's the occasion?",
        "Jeffrey: I'm taking you to dinner. Just the two of us.",
        "Cassie: How sweet are you?",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, sweet? Let's not get crazy.",
        "Cassie: ( Laughs )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: What is your problem?",
        "Dinah: You! You are my problem. Do you realize how close we just got to being busted.",
        "Edmund: Then you should feel very happy that we went to the makeup artist. That thing is incredibly real. Ow!",
        "Dinah: No. Do you even know what it's like to wear this itchy disgusting piece of huge rubber?",
        "Edmund: That itchy, disgusting piece of huge rubber just saved our lives. Dinah, our secret is safe, Darling, it is.",
        "Dinah: Until she sees the sonogram, Darling. We have won ourselves a whopping ten minutes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I want to go out with you so bad.",
        "Jeffrey: Does that mean we can get out of here?",
        "Cassie: Well, not yet, I haven't seen the sonogram so we can go out and celebrate just as soon as I see my baby.",
        "Jeffrey: How come you're not in there?",
        "Cassie: I was asked to leave. Dinah's in a mood.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, it can't be a mood if it's always the same thing.",
        "Cassie: Well, she is pregnant.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, she is Dinah.",
        "Cassie: I'm trying to give her the benefit of the doubt. Edmund is in there, he's trying to calm her down.",
        "Jeffrey: Edmund. Oh, yeah, what a prince.",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Jeffrey: What is it?",
        "Cassie: It's almost like Edmund doesn't want me in there for some reason. I don't know, maybe I'm making something out of nothing. Or whatever. So, where are you taking me?",
        "Jeffrey: The Queen Anne.",
        "Cassie: The cruise around the lake? I've been wanting to go on that.",
        "Jeffrey: I know.",
        "Cassie: Good. I guess we better do these things while we still can.",
        "Jeffrey: Why, someone going somewhere?",
        "Cassie: No, but someone's coming. The baby.",
        "Jeffrey: I forgot. I mean, I didn't forget but... well, you know what I mean.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Life's a little different, you know, with a newborn around.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, um, the baby will not only have you, he'll have Tammy and Mrs. Chitwood.",
        "Cassie: I'm the mother. I've been so caught up in Dinah and making sure she's healthy and Edmund and everything going on with him and keeping him in line that I've kind of forgotten about the other stuff.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you've had plenty of practice.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, but every baby's different. Some sleep through the night, others are up all night long and sleep all day.",
        "Jeffrey: What happens when the baby's up all night?",
        "Cassie: You're up all night.",
        "Jeffrey: What happens if you have to, like, go to work early the morning.",
        "Cassie: Okay, well I guess you're not going to be spend many nights at the farm until the kid's in school.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. So what's a little sleeplessness?",
        "Cassie: It's not just that. There are tons of things, feedings, ear infections, doctor's appointments, then they crawl and walk and potty training.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, so the baby's going to put a damper on our wild, carefree lifestyle.",
        "Cassie: A little, yeah. It is the most amazing and wonderful thing in the whole wild world. But if you can't take it, you can go ahead and go, walk out the door before you get attached because...",
        "Jeffrey: You can't get rid of me that easily. I'm already attached. I hope the new kid likes guitar playing.",
        "Cassie: Well, maybe you can sing the baby to sleep.",
        "Jeffrey: Maybe.",
        "Cassie: You're a brave man, Mr. O'Neill.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well now that you've filled me in on life with baby, we have to take advantage of our pre-baby time. So bon voyage in one hour. That's going to give you enough time?",
        "Cassie: I want to go home and change. I've been wearing this all day at Arch's party and all the kids...",
        "Jeffrey: Got you covered.",
        "Cassie: You bought me a dress?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, my secretary actually did the honors. I chose the color, though.",
        "Cassie: Oh, right. ( Laughs ) Wow. This is wonderful. Thank you.",
        "Jeffrey: Go, go. Get dressed.",
        "Cassie: What if the sonogram guy comes? What if I miss that.",
        "Jeffrey: I'll come get you.",
        "Cassie: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Jeffrey? Is she gone?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, your mom went to get dressed for dinner.",
        "Tammy: Oh, you're not going to dinner.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, we are.",
        "Tammy: Um, no, you're not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Maybe this is a blessing in disguise.",
        "Edmund: What are you talking about?",
        "Dinah: I don't think we thought this through. Cassie can't wait to get her hands on my mid-section. It makes her feel the baby.",
        "Edmund: That can't happen.",
        "Dinah: How are we going to stop it she wants to see the sonogram?",
        "Edmund: I don't know.",
        "Dinah: Just face it, we have failed.",
        "Edmund: No, we haven't failed.",
        "Dinah: When Cassie finds out about this it is going to hurt her undeniably. But you and I, we are together, right?",
        "Edmund: Of course.",
        "Dinah: Let's do it, let's tell her the truth right now.",
        "Cassie: Hey. So? Are we ready to roll?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Sorry I'm late. Wow!",
        "Blake: Better late than never",
        "Harley: This looks really good.",
        "Blake: Look at you!",
        "Harley: You just saw me, Blake.",
        "Blake: I don't care, I have months to make up for. You know what? You're gorgeous.",
        "Harley: Thanks. Are you saying I should be on the run more often?",
        "Blake: Don't you dare. Don't you dare. I can't believe you're standing in front of me and you're free!",
        "Harley: I know. That makes two of us. ( Laughs )",
        "Blake: Wow. So Alan, huh?",
        "Harley: Yeah. Alan.",
        "Blake: Well, he did try to shoot Philip once before.",
        "Harley: Yeah, but I think he was aiming for you.",
        "Blake: Doesn't matter. Same intention.",
        "Harley: His intention is always the same thing, to save his son.",
        "Blake: Okay. This is a happy day. We're going to think about happy thoughts, all right?",
        "Harley: Oh, really?",
        "Blake: Yes.",
        "Harley: Well, the truth is, Blake, I couldn't be happier.",
        "Blake: Me, neither.",
        "Harley: Really? And I have something to tell you but nobody knows it yet.",
        "Blake: Really.",
        "Harley: Yeah. I'm not saying you have to keep it is a secret, I just...",
        "Blake: Good.",
        "Harley: Not that I think you could keep it a secret. Gus and I are engaged again. ( Laughs )",
        "Blake: Wow, engaged. Well, you sure don't waste time.",
        "Harley: Is that Blake for congratulations?",
        "Blake: Of course! Congratulations, Sweetie.",
        "Harley: Thanks, that's really heartfelt.",
        "Blake: Well, it's just that... I just didn't think you were going to rush so quickly back to the alter, that's all.",
        "Harley: Well, why? I mean, if you think about it, we haven't even really been apart.",
        "Blake: True. It... well, except for the time in prison.",
        "Harley: You mean when I was in prison with Mallet?",
        "Blake: You said that, not me.",
        "Harley: Blake, Mallet is my ex-husband.",
        "Blake: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Mallet. And seeing him didn't...",
        "Harley: It didn't.",
        "Blake: No spark, nothing?",
        "Harley: I wanted to strangle him. Is that a spark?",
        "Blake: There's a fine line between love and hate.",
        "Harley: We didn't cross it.",

        "Harley: Why do you say that?",
        "Blake: I read. Harley, I know. Come on. Mallet wants you back, doesn't he? That's why he took the job in the prison.",
        "Harley: No. He took the job in the prison so that he could make up for something that he did to me. And he did make up for it. And I forgive him.",
        "Blake: Wow. That's big.",
        "Harley: Yes, that's very big for me, thank you. But I love Gus. And I am marrying Gus! And nothing's getting in the way this time.",

        "Dr. Emory: I don't think you're quite in a position to be threatening me, Mr. Spaulding. I'll accept a check. Send it by messenger this evening.",
        "Alan: That's impossible. I can't....",
        "Dr. Emory: I'm sure you'll find a way.",

        "Edmund: Oh. Well perhaps there's another one in the other room.",
        "Woman: The other one we have is also on the fritz.",
        "Dinah: What a shame.",
        "Woman: I'm sorry, folks, I'm afraid we'll have to reschedule.",

        "Cassie: Me, too. So what do you think of the dress?",
        "Jeffrey: It's fantastic. Yeah. When I see that, you know, I just think I want to scrap the boat and go for takeout.",
        "Cassie: Huh?",

        "Harley: You know, Blake, one of the good things about being in trouble is that you're too busy to worry about other people's troubles.",

        "Harley: I know you are.",

        "Blake: Okay.",
        "Harley: Blake. I... I was in love with him once upon a time, so of course a little part of me will always love him. But Gus is the love of my life and Mallet's just... he's another ex-husband.",
        "Blake: Who you've forgiven.",
        "Harley: Yes. I'll probably invite him to the wedding.",
        "Blake: Oh, that's so...",
        "Harley: Progressive?",
        "Blake: That, too.",
        "Harley: I know that you're looking for some big revelation here, but there really isn't one. Really. Except that now I can finally put the past where it belongs: In the past. Which makes me very happy.",
        "Blake: That's good then. Then I'm happy for you.",
        "Harley: It is a good thing. You should be a lawyer.",
        "Blake: Don't give me ideas.",
        "Harley: No, truly, it will be small, simple, intimate because it doesn't matter. What matters is that we are getting married, finally. We are starting a life together and nothing, nothing is going to get in the way this time!",

        "Alan: No.",

        "Alan: Well, I've been through hell ever since Philip was taken from me.",
        "Gus: If you've been in hell, I guess you haven't heard the news.",
        "Alan: You mean you didn't come here just to gloat?",
        "Gus: I'm taking over Spaulding Enterprises. That's what you wanted, right? I'm even moving into the house.",
        "Alan: Anything else?",
        "Gus: Yes. I'm taking Harley with me and all of her family.",
        "Alan: Sounds like a reality version of \"The Beverly Hillbillies.\" You should put it on film.",
        "Gus: Like the reality TV. Here's the reality, Dad, Harley will have everything that you lost.",
        "Alan: The only thing that I care about that I lost was Philip.",

        "Harley: And then we could have pool parties.",
        "Blake: My boys would love that so much.",
        "Harley: Your boys are going to be at the stage where they're liking girls. That could be very, very dangerous. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Blake: Get that. It might be about the shower.",
        "Harley: No. Hi, Callahan, how are you doing? No, don't worry about it. What's going on? You're kidding? No, thank you. Thank you for calling me. Absolutely. Yup.",
        "Blake: What? What's wrong.",
        "Harley: That's a guy I used to work with at the station. Gus is down there with Alan.",

        "Harley: I should go.",
        "Blake: Are you sure, Harley, that you want to see Alan face to face?",

        "Blake: It's just a mini little crisis. It's okay. Where's your mom. Is she on her way?",
        "Tammy: She should be. I had to twist Jeffrey's a arm a little bit, but she he said he had to get her here somehow.",

        "Jeffrey: Yeah. Yeah. I feel like a Buzz Burger.",
        "Cassie: Are you kidding?",

        "Cassie: What about the cruise and my dress?",
        "Jeffrey: We can do that some other time. We can do that, you know, later.",
        "Cassie: Am I missing something here?",
        "Jeffrey: I guess I'm a little fickle, I guess.",
        "Cassie: Since when?",

        "Edmund: Tonight, don't worry about tonight. I can fend off Cassie tonight. Really, don't worry.",

        "Edmund: Yes, but that's the whole point, remember?",
