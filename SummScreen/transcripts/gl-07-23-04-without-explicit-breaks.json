        "tony: So what do you think, how you like it? Hmm?",
        "Ray: The renovations look good. You did a great job.",
        "Tony: Thank you.",
        "Ray: Did you call me over here to bless the place? Because I really don't think...",
        "Tony: No, ray, I didn't. I need a personal favor.",
        "Ray: Okay.",
        "Tony: I had a dream, not that it matters much.",
        "Ray: Okay.",
        "Tony: I didn't like it, ray. I don't know. I just... You know what? I need your guidance.",
        "Ray: Tony, unless it was some sort of religious vision, i don't know what I can do for you. I'm a priest; I'm not a shrink.",
        "Tony: Ray, you're the closest thing I've got to it. Come on. Please help me out here.",
        "Ray: All right. What kind of dream was it? Ah, that kind. And you got a problem with that why? Are you a monk now?",
        "Tony: No, man. Not a chance. It's just... You have no idea who I was dreaming about.",
        "Danny: Hey, marina.",
        "Marina: Hi, guys. We're having a private party tonight.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, so?",
        "Marina: So we're closed.",
        "Danny: All right. Well, we'll go somewhere else. What's going on?",
        "Marina: Oh, harley and gus.",
        "Danny: Oh. Good. Well, good for them. Hey, how's your dad holding up?",
        "Michelle: What, is he sick or something?",
        "Danny: No. Her dad is frank cooper, the police chief, and...",
        "Michelle: Oh, the dirty cop in the papers.",
        "Marina: We're closed. That's what private party means. See you, danny.",
        "Danny: Yeah, all right. Take care.",
        "Michelle: She doesn't like me very much, you know.",
        "Danny: Well, she used to.",
        "Michelle: Yeah. Those were the good old days. Well, it's early. Where do you want to go?",
        "Danny: I don't know. We could go to towers. They've got a nice view. Olivia's bar.",
        "Michelle: Can we go see tony?",
        "Phillip: Alan, are we almost ready to go?",
        "Alan: Yes. Are you both going?",
        "Phillip: Well, I am the brother of the groom.",
        "Alan: What about her?",
        "Olivia: She's the dutiful wife. Get over it.",
        "Alan: Duty and custom have often given way to grudges in this family.",
        "Phillip: Yes. Well, seething hatreds aside, this evening the spauldings are at least going to appear as a unified front.",
        "Alan: I hope so.",
        "Olivia: Okay, here's your chance. No one's going to know that I'm not even there, so why don't you just go it alone?",
        "Phillip: No. I want you there.",
        "Olivia: No, that's just a masochistic impulse. Just stick your head between your knees and breathe. It'll pass.",
        "Phillip: No. It's a family event. And to be honest with you, since we've cast aside all pretense and we're now despising each other freely, I don't know, it's funny, but i mind it less.",
        "Olivia: Oh. I'm feeling a warm glow.",
        "Phillip: You should give it a try. Might do wonders for you.",
        "Olivia: Oh, i doubt it.",
        "Buzz: I was hoping we'd have a moment alone together. I need to warn you about this mess with frank.",
        "Alexandra: It's awful.",
        "Buzz: My son is innocent.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, I don't doubt that.",
        "Buzz: He's also on the hunt for whoever set him up, and so am i.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, honestly, you don't know anything about detective work. Come on. How can...",
        "Buzz: It's a lead i'm helping him with. He's got a gut feeling about someone.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, my. Who's the unlucky target?",
        "Buzz: You.",
        "Frank: Forget it. I will call back. Thank you.",
        "Darci: Ross still isn't taking your call?",
        "Frank: You know what? How much you guys want to bet the man's probably standing right there in his office?",
        "Marina: Ross wouldn't blow you off, dad. I'm sure he's just busy.",
        "Frank: Yeah, yeah. Too busy to help his top cop beat these trumped-up charges, huh? Well, you know what? Doesn't matter. Forget it. I am completely fine.",
        "Darci: Are you sure, honey?",
        "Frank: Absolutely.",
        "Darci: You have to face the spauldings tonight.",
        "Frank: I'm fine, trust me.",
        "Danny: Come on, let's just drop it, okay? Please?",
        "Michelle: Not until you tell me what's wrong.",
        "Danny: There's nothing wrong. I just wasn't planning on seeing tony tonight, that's all.",
        "Michelle: You mean you didn't want to see tony. I just want to show him my tattoo.",
        "Danny: Oh. Well, then, let's get over there right away.",
        "Michelle: Wow, you guys had a fight, huh?",
        "Danny: No. You know...",
        "Michelle: About what?",
        "Danny: Michelle, can we just get out of here before the spauldings and the coopers show up and start throwing punches and...",
        "Michelle: What did you and tony fight about, danny?",
        "Danny: It's nothing. Tony and i are always fighting. If it's not one thing, it's something else. It doesn't matter.",
        "Michelle: Yeah?",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Michelle: Well, it matters to me.",
        "Harley: What do you think?",
        "Gus: I don't think we can let this happen to frank.",
        "Harley: I was talking about the dress.",
        "Gus: It's nice. They've practically got him tried and convicted here before they've gotten started.",
        "Harley: I've been avoiding reading anything.",
        "Gus: Yeah. I'm not going to quit, you know, until I help clear his name.",
        "Harley: We all want frank to be exonerated. But for tonight, the spauldings and the coopers are going to put aside their differences. Tonight we'll be on the same side.",
        "Cassie: Oh, gosh. The lights of venice, they're so beautiful. They have to be the most beautiful.",
        "Edmund: Well, i think paris might have something to say about that. But they're beautiful. Yes, they are. Just as you will be at this evening's gala charity auction.",
        "Cassie: Oh, gosh. It's been so long since I've done something like this. But phony cassie sure has been making the circuit.",
        "Edmund: Well, cassie, it's like riding a bike, just in a very expensive gown.",
        "Cassie: Mmm. And we'll have to get back quick, you know. We have to get back in time for harley's wedding.",
        "Edmund: What about my surprise for you? You don't want to see it?",
        "Cassie: Well, what do you think? Come on. What are you smiling about?",
        "Edmund: You must choose something to wear.",
        "Cassie: Oh, my, edmund...",
        "Edmund: Usually the lights go out when i do that, but then the makeup artist couldn't see what we was doing. I know, I know, I know, I know. I'm far too much. But you are going to be the belle of the ball.",
        "Dinah: \"For her royal highness princess cassandra winslow. The honor of your presence is requested...\" Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Of course it is. This portion of \"guiding light\" is sponsored by luvs. Live and learn, and then get luvs.",
        "cassie: Can you give us a minute, please?",
        "Edmund: Thank you. You didn't like my surprise?",
        "Cassie: No, that's not it. That's not it. It's just that, you know, yesterday we were hanging out at the farm, and now there's all this pampering going on.",
        "Edmund: All of which you richly deserve.",
        "Cassie: You just said that i... You're making this up as you go along, aren't you?",
        "Edmund: Out of whole cloth. Yes, i am.",
        "Cassie: Just as long as we're clear why I'm even doing this.",
        "Edmund: Because you're a girl out looking for a good time.",
        "Cassie: Well, i'm also hoping to get a look at the high life this impostor has been living as me. And this auction is just the type of event that she'd go to.",
        "Edmund: Yes, it is. And with any luck, she's lost somewhere in the balkans. But cassie, I have to admit, i have an agenda here.",
        "Cassie: Pamper me silly?",
        "Edmund: Yes. Yes, that, and i want to show venetian society how it's done when it's done very well. And if this impostor shows her face, we'll tease her for a bit and then call in the authorities.",
        "Cassie: If I don't tear her apart myself.",
        "Dinah: Yes, good evening. How sweet of you to think of me, but I am otherwise engaged for this evening. The charity auction for the international museum of modern art. With the royal family of denmark attending, yes. It sounds absolutely wonderful, but I can'T. Well, reputation is the currency of the realm, that is for sure. But I simply cannot. I am so sorry. Thank you, though, for thinking of me. And please give my apologies to the royal family on my behalf. Very good. Another time. Cheers. Okay. Oh, my gosh, so much do to, so little time. All right.",
        "Alexandra: Frank still suspects me?",
        "Buzz: Afraid so.",
        "Alexandra: Me and drugs? Come on. It's so ludicrous.",
        "Buzz: Well, you know, frank's a cop with a case that has loose ends. And frank's going to think what frank's going to think.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, come... Why involve me? I've answered every one of his questions.",
        "Buzz: I'm telling you this because I think it's better for you to know. I have a different take on it, and I'm betting that time is going to prove me right.",
        "Alexandra: What's your theory?",
        "Buzz: This is about revenge, and the one guy that wants to get frank in spades is a man that he put behind bars.",
        "Alexandra: Vinnie salerno.",
        "Buzz: Frank helped bring down his horrible organization. He's got one of his girls. Salerno's probably stewing right now over the fact that darci can put him away for a long time.",
        "Alexandra: Yes. Well, she certainly could have him over a barrel.",
        "Buzz: Yeah. I think that salerno got frank kicked off the force as sort of a last major play.",
        "Alexandra: Well, can you convince your son of that?",
        "Buzz: I'm sorry he's got you in his crosshairs. I didn't want to dump this on you tonight. But you know, we're going to be celebrating with the whole cooper family.",
        "Alexandra: Yeah. No, no. Actually, I'm glad you told me, because if frank's going to give me dirty looks across the room, at least i'll know why. All right, i'll do my best to put all this messy business behind us for tonight.",
        "Buzz: Yeah. Gus and harley deserve our undivided attention. After all, they closed the gap between the two families.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, well, i thought you and I did that.",
        "Buzz: Well, we certainly forged a trail.",
        "Gus: Listen. You know, your family means just as much to me as my own. In fact, if I had to make a choice...",
        "Harley: You won't have to make a choice.",
        "Gus: But frank had a raw deal here. He just got a raw deal. I don't want his job. I just want to help clear him in this whole thing.",
        "Harley: Honey, don't feel bad for stepping in for frank. Okay, next to him you're the highest-ranking guy on the force. He understands.",
        "Gus: Yeah, well, he shouldn't have to.",
        "Harley: But he does. Everybody understands. We trust that you will do your best. I trust you.",
        "Gus: Should we go?",
        "Harley: This is a miserable time, okay? But just for tonight, can we... Can we forget about all that stuff, and we could just... Can we just think about how great it's going to be to walk down the aisle and become man and wife? Can we focus on having fun?",
        "Gus: Yes, yes. Let's do that. That's... We should do that.",
        "Harley: Let's do that. And let's just know that it will all work itself out after the wedding.",
        "Gus: Your brother's neck is on the chopping block, and you're consoling me. Is that a little backwards?",
        "Harley: That's what we do, right? You need some reassuring, we do that for each other.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: Man and wife.",
        "Gus: Yeah. (Phone rings)",
        "harley: I'm going to get that. You go start the car. I'll be right out.",
        "Gus: All right. (Phone rings)",
        "harley: Hello?",
        "Darci: Harley, it's darci.",
        "Harley: Hey, darci. What's up?",
        "Darci: I want to give you a heads-up. Things are not going well for frank tonight.",
        "Harley: More bad news?",
        "Darci: No, thank god, but i think this whole situation is starting to wear on him. I'm worried about tonight.",
        "Frank: Hey, sisarini. I don't know what darci told you, but i am completely fine.",
        "Harley: Frank...",
        "Frank: I am fine. I am totally fine, and i'd just like to know when my sister's going to get here. Come on.",
        "Harley: I think i know you a little bit better than that.",
        "Frank: Little sister, tonight is your night, and i'm not going to let any of my little problems ruin it, i promise you.",
        "Harley: Frank, I know how tough this is for you.",
        "Frank: Hey, whoever said life's supposed to be easy anyway?",
        "Harley: I'm just saying that if i knew for sure that alan or alex were behind this, they wouldn't be getting out of there alive.",
        "Frank: Yeah. Well, we don't know that yet.",
        "Harley: But in the meantime, I know how tough it's going to be for you being in the same room as them.",
        "Frank: Hey, didn't you just hear a word I said? I told you i'm completely fine. So listen-- end of discussion. Just get your little heiney over here now. I love you.",
        "Gus: Everything okay?",
        "Harley: I hope so.",
        "buzz: Well, the gang's all here. Both gangs, actually. I trust we've left our lethal weapons behind us.",
        "Alan: Yes, but not our sharp tongues.",
        "Buzz: Oh, let's see if we can hold that in check. I want to officially welcome the spaulding clan. Thank you for joining us tonight.",
        "Phillip: Anything for a good cause.",
        "Buzz: Doesn't get any better than this, does it?",
        "Frank: I'll drink to that.",
        "Alan: Frank, how are you?",
        "Frank: Oh, I've been better, but thanks for asking.",
        "Darci: Mr. Spaulding, so happy that you could join us tonight.",
        "Marina: Here's your lemonade, fresh-squeezed.",
        "Alan: Oh. Well, where is the happy couple?",
        "Marina: Fashionably late.",
        "Alan: Oh, i see.",
        "Gus: Hey!",
        "Harley: We're here.",
        "Buzz: Well, i'm officially appointing myself bartender for this evening. Libations all around. There will be a lot of toasts, you know. There'll be dinner in a while, and things. Would you see if something's burning in the kitchen while i try to loosen these stiffs up?",
        "Marina: Sure.",
        "Frank: All right, poparino, me first. I'm empty.",
        "Buzz: Frank, I think you've had enough.",
        "Frank: It's a party.",
        "Buzz: Give it a break, frank.",
        "Frank: I don't feel like giving it a break.",
        "Buzz: I know you're upset. You have every right to be. But tonight is not about you.",
        "Frank: Tonight's about harley and gus.",
        "Buzz: Frank, it's about all of us. I know how you feel about alan and alex, you know. And drinking the night away may seem to you a perfect way to keep yourself from punching their lights out. But think about your sister, her happiness. And frank, there's no way I'm going to let you ruin this night, no matter what you've been through.",
        "Gus: So how are you, mrs. Godfrey?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, all right. I'm going to let that godfrey remark slide, because I want to tell you that I think you're doing the absolute right thing by not telling harley anything.",
        "Gus: Anything about what?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, honestly. Do we have to play this game?",
        "Gus: Well, do we know any other game to play? I don't think so.",
        "Alexandra: When you left me, I didn't know what you were going to do. You made me quite nervous.",
        "Gus: Well, I didn't know exactly what i was going to do.",
        "Alexandra: Well, do you know now?",
        "Gus: Yes. I'm going to keep on lying like the lying spaulding that i am. But I do want you to know I have limits.",
        "Ray: Like i said, man, I am no shrink, but there's no reason to jump to conclusions over some dream.",
        "Tony: It was about michelle, ray.",
        "Ray: Sometimes dreams are whatever's left bouncing around your head at the end of the day.",
        "Tony: I don't want to have it again.",
        "Ray: I can't help you with that, T.",
        "Tony: I know. You know what? Forget it. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought it up. Forget i even mentioned it. It's not that big of a deal.",
        "Ray: It's okay. I don't want to preach to you, tony.",
        "Tony: That's your job, ray, huh?",
        "Ray: It's never done any good. You've never been too receptive. Look, in my opinion, i think this dream means that you're uncertain about things with michelle. Look, man, that's understandable. We all are. It doesn't mean you want her.",
        "Tony: That's kind of what it felt like, ray.",
        "Ray: It... Look, it could be that you want to protect her, help her.",
        "Tony: I do. That's what I'm trying to do, all right? I just... I don't know, man. I think that danny may be right. If she just comes back, remembers everything, everything's going to be all right.",
        "Ray: Tony, that is not going to happen. Michelle's changed. Good or bad, we don't know. We know we love her, right?",
        "Tony: Yeah.",
        "Ray: We want her to live her life as best she can under the circumstances.",
        "Tony: It's all god's will, right?",
        "Ray: I think so. She's not going to be going back to being the old michelle. Right now our job is to help her along, deal with her as she is now.",
        "Tony: What about the dream, ray?",
        "Ray: There's no harm done as long as you don't feel like you need to act on it.",
        "Michelle: Tony santos. It's time we got something settled between us.",
        "Cassie: Wow. It's been a while since I've been to one of these. Look at all these people.",
        "Edmund: And you, my dear, are drawing every eye in the room. Cassie? Cassie?",
        "Cassie: Hmm?",
        "Edmund: Take a breath. And it's customary to be announced before we enter the room. Shall we?",
        "Cassie: No, no, no, no. There's some slight chance that the impostor princess cassie is here. We don't want to scare her off.",
        "Edmund: Oh, good point. All right. Well, it's a silent auction. Items are magnificent. No one needs to know we're here. And if i remember correctly, the view of st. Mark's square is beautiful from this balcony. Shall we?",
        "Cassie: I haven't had a chance to thank you.",
        "Edmund: For what?",
        "Cassie: For helping me feel like a princess, and not thinking i'm crazy.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, you are the most beautiful woman in this room, and there is nothing i could do or say to make you more of a princess than you've been your whole life. Now, as for being crazy...",
        "Herald: Ladies and gentlemen, her royal highness princess cassandra winslow. (Applause)",
        "dinah: Well, it looks like everyone's here this evening. How divine.",
        "Prince: Well, the party hadn't started until you arrived.",
        "Dinah: Oh, I like you.",
        "Cassie: Wow, it's so beautiful.",
        "Edmund: Events like this can be just the beginning if you'd like, cassie.",
        "Cassie: We'll see. I must have left my purse inside. I'll be right back. Coming up on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Frank: I promise you no one's going to get hurt here-- no one who doesn't deserve to. I liked it. I liked it. I did.",
        "Edmund: Here it is, darling. You set it down right over there.",
        "Cassie: What would I do without you?",
        "Edmund: Well, hurling yourself into the danube has become quite fashionable.",
        "Cassie: Oh.",
        "Prince: I want to show you something very special.",
        "Dinah: Okay. I'm all yours, for now.",
        "Cassie: Let's check out the goods.",
        "Edmund: All right. What do we have here? My, oh my, oh my. I've seen this in pictures, but i never thought it would be available to the public.",
        "Cassie: A knife?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, this is a 16th century dagger from the old globe theater. Probably used by shakespeare himself.",
        "Cassie: Wow.",
        "Edmund: Yeah. I saw it in a book when I was nine years old, and I think I've been in love with it ever since.",
        "Cassie: You should bid on it.",
        "Edmund: No, this is far too rich for my blood. I think I'm just torturing myself looking at it. So let's move on down the line, shall we?",
        "Cassie: You know what? This place is like a fairy tale. It's exactly the kind of event that the woman who is pretending to be me would show up to.",
        "Edmund: Well, try to keep your anger in check, and have a good time, all right?",
        "Cassie: I'm going to have fun whether she's here or not.",
        "Edmund: Good.",
        "Dinah: This is gorgeous. I've been looking for a piece just like this.",
        "Prince: It's as beautiful as you are. Place a bid.",
        "Cassie: Why don't you find us some champagne, and I'll meet you back here.",
        "Edmund: All right. Don't be long. The auction's about to begin.",
        "Cassie: Excuse me. I would like to place a bid on the shakespearean dagger.",
        "Auctioneer: Certainly, madam.",
        "Cassie: Thank you.",
        "Edmund: Oh, i'm terribly sorry. Let me get that for you. Here you are.",
        "Dinah: Klutz. Thank you.",
        "Tony: All right, what did i do?",
        "Michelle: I'm just saying i've got a bone to pick with you, that's all.",
        "Ray: Do you need any spiritual mediation?",
        "Michelle: I think i've got it covered, padre.",
        "Ray: Okay. Well, bro, i'm going to take off.",
        "Tony: Okay.",
        "Ray: Michelle, you look wonderful.",
        "Michelle: Thanks. Thanks. I feel really good. And I know if my memory doesn't come back, i'm on the right path.",
        "Ray: That's good. I'd like to hear about it. Stop by the church sometime. We'll talk. I've got a lot of people praying for you.",
        "Michelle: Thank you. That means a lot.",
        "Ray: Okay. Guys, I love you guys.",
        "Dinah: See you soon.",
        "Tony: Okay. So you come barging in here like cops with a warrant. What's the deal? What's going on?",
        "Michelle: Well, i'll make it short. Don't be such a punk.",
        "Tony: All right. Well, that's kind of funny, because my horoscope said the same thing today.",
        "Michelle: You and danny had a fight, right?",
        "Tony: Well, michelle, we do that sometimes.",
        "Michelle: Yeah. Well, not with me around, you don't, okay? I already told danny to cut it out. He wouldn't tell me what happened, but I think we need to settle this right here and right now.",
        "Tony: Well, michelle, i'm sure whatever it was it was my fault.",
        "Danny: It usually is.",
        "Michelle: Oh, okay, okay. I see. This is how it works. Everyone's all buddy- buddy here. No one's talking.",
        "Tony: Well, there's nothing to worry about. It's okay.",
        "Michelle: You know, i don't believe you, but whatever. The real reason I came, ta-dah! What do you think, huh? How cool is that?",
        "Phillip: Now, they look happy.",
        "Olivia: I remember happy.",
        "Phillip: Do you?",
        "Olivia: No, not really.",
        "Phillip: I'm happy. This arrangement is actually working out quite well for me.",
        "Olivia: I'm so glad.",
        "Phillip: Listen, it doesn't have to be horrible for you. Just use it. Accept that you're doing what's best for emma.",
        "Olivia: With a guillotine blade hanging over my head.",
        "Phillip: I didn't say it was perfect.",
        "Olivia: Don't you miss it, having something real?",
        "Phillip: I had that with beth, and with harley in a different way.",
        "Olivia: But isn't that what we should be wishing for, instead of what we've got?",
        "Phillip: I'd say we've both had our chances.",
        "Frank: Hey, great party, huh?",
        "Harley: Stop. You don't have to pretend. It's me.",
        "Frank: What are you talking? I'm not pretending anything here. Look, we've got great food, we're having good quality family time.",
        "Harley: Stop pretending. You're not even good at it. Are you drunk?",
        "Frank: I'm fine. Go have fun. Come on.",
        "Harley: You're not fine. You're like a bomb with a smoldering fuse. See, if brad green had just told us who he was working with before he died we could crack this thing wide open, and we could get you off. If he'd said something more substantial than just \"god free.\"",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, you know what? He didn'T. You know, deathbeds aren't the only place you can drag a confession out of someone. You know what? I'm sorry. That was... Let's just forget this, okay? I'm fine. You go have some fun, okay?",
        "Harley: I don't think you're capable of being fine tonight.",
        "Frank: Really? Have i ever let you down?",
        "Harley: No, never.",
        "Frank: Well, you know what? It's not going to happen tonight. Have fun. Well, I think we can slip out of here now without anybody noticing. We'll be doing them all a favor anyway.",
        "Olivia: Not exposing them to our cheery life, huh?",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, you're right. We'd probably just jinx them anyway. Come on. You know what just happened? We actually agreed on something without harsh words or an attitude.",
        "Phillip: Don't let it go to your head.",
        "Olivia: Oh, honey, I won'T. Let's take separate cars.",
        "Buzz: Okay, i want to get the celebration on the road. First off I want to say what an honor it is to raise a glass to gus and harley tying the knot at last! (Laughter)",
        "harley: He finally succumbed to my charms.",
        "Buzz: Yeah. You know, I had-- well, how should we put this?-- Doubts about your future husband.",
        "Frank: You never wanted him anywhere near her.",
        "Buzz: Okay. He used to get under my skin. What can i say?",
        "Marina: So, will we be getting to the happy part soon?",
        "Buzz: Well, when we found out that he was actually your son, all the bets were off.",
        "Alan: Well, i wasn't looking forward to spending a thanksgiving with you either, buzz.",
        "Buzz: Well, but that's all blood under the bridge, isn't it? Tonight we celebrate the union of two amazing people, and the coming together of two, well, in their own ways, incredible families. But I guess what i really want to say is how much i love you, and how much i've come to love your guy. As we all know... And he's shown us all what he's made of. He is a man of integrity, honor, truth, and best of all, he loves my daughter better than anyone else in the world ever could.",
        "Alan: Thank you, buzz. As father of the groom, I would like to say a few words if i might. First of all, harley, I know that when you see a spaulding, your instinct is to run to the hills.",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, she's got very good reason to.",
        "Alan: But harley, we're grateful that you decided to stick it out this time.",
        "Harley: Well, he may be a spaulding now, but i got to him first.",
        "Alan: You know, i can't help but feel that this union of yours is a reward for all the hard times you two have been through together. It's taken a lot of love and patience, and, well, macaroni and cheese. But I want you to know, harley, I'll be very proud to call you a daughter-in-law. And I will be very happy to be associated with your wonderful family, the coopers. To the coopers.",
        "Alan: And i'm... I know that my sister would like to say something. Alexandra?",
        "Alexandra: Actually, you know what? I don't think I can top that, really.",
        "Alan: I'm sure you can. Please, go.",
        "Frank: You know what? I'm not at a loss for words. Don't worry. I promise you no one's going to get hurt here. No one who doesn't deserve to.",

        "Cassie: This should be good.",
        "Auctioneer: The etruscan vase to bidder 15 for 10,000 euros. (Applause) the 17th century sapphire brooch for 125,000 to bidder nine. (Applause) the shakespearean dagger, 30,000 to bidder three. (Applause)",
        "edmund: Worth every penny and more.",
        "Cassie: Shoot.",
        "Edmund: What?",
        "Cassie: Well, i was, like, beat out by a lot.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, you didn'T... You put a bid in on the dagger?",
        "Cassie: Yes. I wanted to surprise you. So surprise-- we lost.",
        "Edmund: I can't believe you. You're far too generous.",
        "Cassie: I would be if we would have won.",
        "Edmund: Well, it's the thought that counts. And you think about me far too much. Thank you.",
        "Cassie: You're welcome. I'm sick of the crab puffs. Let's get out of here. I hear there are some great italian restaurants in this town.",
        "Edmund: No, that's just a rumor. But you want to leave already?",
        "Cassie: Well, the impostor is obviously not here, so i'd like to go have some fun before we have to get back for harley's wedding.",
        "Edmund: Sounds good to me.",
        "Cassie: Wait.",
        "Edmund: What?",
        "Cassie: Aren't you the least bit curious?",
        "Edmund: Curious about what?",
        "Cassie: You've been in love with that dagger since you were a child. Don't you want to know who beat us out?",
        "Edmund: No, it would only add to the misery. Please, let's go.",
        "Cassie: Oh, come on. Excuse me. Could you point out the winning bidder for the shakespearean dagger?",
        "Auctioneer: Right over there. She was eager to attend another function, so i sent her to collect the piece.",
        "Cassie: Mmm. Well, it's a woman. Maybe you can work your charm. Let's go find her.",
        "michelle: So then he asks me, like, you know, if i have a pattern or anything that i want, or if I looked at any books. And I said, \"well, yeah. I've got something in mind. The symbol for ambition.\" So then he says, \"all right, turn around. Show me the goods.\"",
        "Danny: This just keeps getting better and better.",
        "Michelle: He's just mad because some other guy saw my good stuff.",
        "Tony: To be honest with you, I would, too. I mean if I were danny.",
        "Danny: Okay. So are we done with this very exciting recap?",
        "Michelle: Okay, this is my first tattoo. Can a girl gloat a little? Geez. Okay. Ask me if it hurt. Come on. Ask me. Ask me. Ask me if it hurt.",
        "Tony: Okay, okay. Did it hurt?",
        "Michelle: No. Yes, it hurt like a mother.",
        "Tony: Well, you'll get used to it. I mean...",
        "Michelle: I mean, tony, i sweat so bad i could have been in a wet t-shirt contest. But I have you to thank.",
        "Tony: Thank me for what? You don't need to thank me.",
        "Michelle: No. You were my inspiration.",
        "Tony: No, michelle. Michelle, millions of people have tattoos. You don't need to thank me.",
        "Michelle: And now i'm one of them.",
        "Tony: You know what? Listen, it's getting late. I've got meet bill for some business. So please...",
        "Danny: Oh, yeah? How's that going?",
        "Tony: It's going. It's going. I hate to kick you guys out, but get out.",
        "Michelle: Fine. We'll go. We'll see you tomorrow?",
        "Tony: Mm-mmm. I might be busy. We'll see. I'm not sure.",
        "Michelle: I don't really take no very well. But whatever. Later.",
        "Tony: Later. Hey, michelle? I like the ink.",
        "Michelle: Thanks. Do you think he liked it? Because I thought he'd be, you know, more impressed, being a tattoo connoisseur and all.",
        "Danny: I don't know. Maybe you just took him by surprise. You know, you've been doing that a lot lately.",
        "Michelle: Not the same homemaker/goody two shoes mommy doctor wife anymore?",
        "Danny: Hey, you know, you were always a lot more than that.",

        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Michelle: I'm sorry that i dragged you all the way down here, but tony's family, you know, and I kind of feel like he's the only one who really gets me besides you, you know?",
        "Danny: Yeah. No, you didn't drag me anywhere. I'd follow you to the end of the world. I'm stuck on you.",
        "Michelle: You have got a habit of always saying the right thing, whether it's corny or lovey-dovey.",
        "Danny: Hey, what was corny about that?",
        "Michelle: No, no, i liked it. I liked it. I did.",
        "Frank: I would just like to say that the hot country below us has completely frozen over, and that pigs are flying high all over fifth street.",
        "Buzz: Frank...",
        "Frank: No. And you know why? We're all together. Oh, man, who would have thought? The coopers and the spauldings. Hey, i hope no one here present is thinking about stabbing somebody in the back, because you know what? You can't do it, because we're all face to face here. You know what? This is a perfect, perfect opportunity just to clear the air, isn't it? Right, folks? I mean, come on. Let's just put everything out on the table right now. Right here, right now.",

        "Darci: Harley, I'm so sorry. Frank is under a tremendous amount of stress lately. Just don't let it ruin your evening, okay? Everyone, I would like to make a toast to the bride.",
        "Marina: Yeah, let's hear it for harley.",
        "Darci: Harley, you're the best. You're an incredible mom, sister, daughter, and a future sister-in-law. I'm so excited. And now you're going to make an incredible wife. Gus is so lucky to have someone like you. You're both lucky. Anyway, I love you, and I wish you happiness, and i know that we are all looking forward to the big wedding day.",
        "Alan: Hear, hear.",
        "Darci: Oh, and alan, alan. I would like to toast to alan for all of your generosity. Thank you very much. And to the ultimate wedding planner, the woman who has prepared all of the details for this big event. We all owe you so much, mrs. Godfrey.",
        "Harley: What did you say?",
        "Cassie: We lost her. I can't believe this. I cannot leave here until I find out who got their hands on that dagger.",
        "Edmund: Well, that shouldn't be too difficult. I beg your pardon.",
        "Auctioneer: Yes, sir?",
        "Cassie: Hi, we're sorry to bother you, but we didn't catch the name of the person who placed the winning bid on the shakespearean dagger.",
        "Auctioneer: The successful bid was made by the princess.",

        "Auctioneer: Cassandra winslow.",
        "Dinah: I wonder if it's ever really drawn blood.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Cassie: Because she probably knows who we are and what we're doing here. That's why she disappeared so quickly.",
        "Edmund: Either that or she caught a glimpse of you.",
        "Alexandra: I don't think darci had anything more to say.",
