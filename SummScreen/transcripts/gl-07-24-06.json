        "Harley: Thank you all for accepting me and supporting me and following me. And let me assure you, I leave Spaulding in the best of hands. So now let me announce my successor, the person who will lead this company into a bold new future.",
        "Alexandra: D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again. (Laughs)",
        "Harley: Alan-Michael Spaulding.",

        "Billy: You don't get it, do you? You don't have any choices. You want to live or you want to die?",
        "Reva: Well, when you put it that way...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Cell phone rings)",
        "Josh: It's Reva. (Ringing continues)",
        "Cassie: Answer it. Josh, it's not about us right now. It's not. You'll regret it if you don't answer.",
        "Josh: Hello?",
        "Reva: Bud. I'm so sorry, but I need your help.",
        "Josh: What seems to be the problem, Reva?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Look, I don't want any excuses. You almost ruined everything. But in spite of your incompetence, it seems our message got across.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Come back to me, baby, okay?",
        "Lizzie: Jonathan, if there's anything I can do, just let me know, okay?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Sit with her. Hey! You did this!",
        "Alan: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Hey, where are you, by the way? Aside from with Billy, I mean.",
        "Reva: Well, actually, I'm alone right now. And where, I'll get to that.",
        "Josh: Sure, you will.",
        "Reva: Joshua, this isn't easy for me. There's something I have to tell you that...",
        "Josh: Well?",
        "Reva: I, I've... oh, God. I don't even know where to start.",
        "Josh: Okay, you know what? Don't bother.",
        "Reva: Joshua...",
        "Josh: No, Reva, I, I... I don't have time for this right now, because where I am right now is important. I'm at Cedars with Jonathan and with Cassie.",
        "Reva: Cedars?",
        "Josh: Yeah. Your niece, Tammy, has been hurt.",
        "Reva: What happened? How was she hurt?",
        "Josh: Well, she... unfortunately walked in on a little robbery taking place at Company. You know, a couple of guys with guns, that kind of thing.",
        "Reva: Oh, lord, she wasn't--",
        "Josh: No, no, she wasn't because Harley and Gus stopped it, but not before Tammy took a blow to the head. She passed out. She's unconscious now.",
        "Reva: How serious is it?",
        "Josh: Well, we don't know right now, Reva. In fact, I think that the only thing that I know for sure right now is that Cassie and Jonathan and I are all here with Tammy, waiting, and you are not. You could be, if you chose to come home.",
        "Reva: There's nothing that I want more than to be there, but...",
        "Josh: Let me guess. You can't.",
        "Reva: No. Not right now, no.",
        "Josh: Reva, what the hell is wrong with you? Are you really that selfish? I mean, your niece...",
        "Reva: You know what, I'll check in again with you soon. And when Tammy opens her eyes will you please tell her that I love her and everyone else there? You'll look after them all, won't you Joshua? I mean, you'll do that, right?",
        "Josh: I always do. I have to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Quite a surprise to me. Why didn't you tell me?",
        "Alan-Michael: I just found out, myself.",
        "Harley: My successor may come as a surprise to you. However, let me assure you that I have the best interests of this company at heart, and I hand over the reigns to a man who I know will ensure that this company not only survives, but wins, because that is certainly in his best interest. Alan-Michael, will you join me, please? Congratulations. I bet this wasn't in your daily planner.",
        "Alan-Michael: Hardly. Is this for real?",
        "Harley: Well, you're the right man for the job. We are going to take a short break and then we'll turn the video feed on once we've worked out a few small details.",
        "Alan-Michael: Details? You made it sound like it was a done deal.",
        "Harley: Oh, I want you to have the job. However, there's just a few small strings attached.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: All Tammy did is care about Lizzie. She wanted her to have a safe place to live with me and Tammy. You? You can't handle that, you miserable-- you put her in a hospital bed!",
        "Alan: It's a terrible thing that happened to Tammy. You know, Jonathan, Springfield's getting more dangerous every day.",
        "Jonathan: Alan, I am going to hurt you.",
        "Alan: It's getting to where you can't even go out in public for fear of what might happen to Tammy. I think she would agree that bad things can happen to good people if they're not careful.",
        "Jonathan: Wow, man. Do you have a death wish, or do you want me to fly off the handle so I land back in the cell so I can't get near Lizzie and her kid? Because it's not going to happen. So if you have a plan B, I suggest you get to it.",
        "Lizzie: What the hell is going on out here?",
        "Jonathan: Ask your grandfather. Man, you people suck!",
        "Lizzie: Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: No. I wanted nothing to do with you, nothing to do with your damn kid. Now Tammy is in a hospital bed. This is what the Spaulding's do for us.",
        "Lizzie: You think I wanted this to happen? Do you think I wanted you anywhere near me or my baby?",
        "Jonathan: Well, you know, it's not exactly my idea of a walk in the park!",
        "Lizzie: Okay, not yours or anybody else's.",
        "Cassie: What the hell are you doing out here?",
        "Jonathan: This whole thing is a nightmare.",
        "Lizzie: For once, I agree with you.",
        "Tammy: Mom?",
        "Cassie: Tammy?",
        "Alan: What did I tell you, Elizabeth? I tried to tell you the kind of man he is.",
        "Lizzie: Just stop it, okay? I don't want to hear it.",
        "Alan: He was as cold as ice in regards to you and your baby.",
        "Lizzie: He is upset because of Tammy and you!",
        "Alan: Lizzie, don't be a fool. And don't get upset and stressed out. Now, I think you need to come home with me and rest.",
        "Lizzie: No. You go.",
        "Alan: You know I'm right. Jonathan cares about one girl and that is Tammy. He doesn't care about you or his baby, and the sooner you accept that, the better off you, the baby, and our family will be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: You look good. Especially with your eyes open. (Tammy and Jonathan laugh together) What's the matter?",
        "Tammy: I hit my head and I... I thought I was okay, but then I went down.",
        "Cassie: Shh, it's okay, it's okay. I'm going to tell the doctor that you're awake, okay? Sweetie, I'm so glad to have you back.",
        "Jonathan: She's got that right.",
        "Cassie: That yelling out there...?",
        "Lizzie: It was nothing.",
        "Jonathan: Stay out of this.",
        "Lizzie: I just wanted to say hi to Tammy",
        "Jonathan: She's a--",
        "Tammy: She is not going anywhere. We came this far as a team. We can't fall apart now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: She's awake! She's awake, she's awake!",
        "Josh: Really?! That is fantastic.",
        "Cassie: I'm looking for a doctor, I--",
        "Josh: You know what, let me... let me do that for you.",
        "Cassie: No, it's all right, I'll do it.",
        "Josh: No, please. I-- you should be there with Tammy, I'll go track down Mel, it's fine.",
        "Cassie: Are, are you sure you don't want--",
        "Josh: What do you think?",
        "Cassie: (Relieved laugh) Thank you Josh. Thank you.",
        "Josh: No problem.",
        "Cassie: Hey, whatever. I didn't asked what happened with the call from Reva.",
        "Josh: Forget Reva.",

        "Billy: Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Where do you think you're going?",
        "Reva: They need me.",
        "Billy: Who needs you?",
        "Reva: The family. Tammy's been hurt.",
        "Billy: Just stop it, girl.",
        "Reva: I have to go, Billy!",
        "Billy: Darling, you can't leave, you are sick!",
        "Reva: I don't-- that call that I made to Joshua, I made because I needed him, but it turns out it's the other way around and I have to go.",
        "Billy: Darling, you can't leave.",
        "Reva: Billy, I can!",
        "Billy: No, Reva! Reva, Reva, Reva.",
        "Reva: Billy! Please? (Sobbing) I don't like this. I don't like this feeling of being so weak and being so sick. I don't like being this needy!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: This I have to hear.",
        "Alan-Michael: What kind of strings are we talking about, here?",
        "Harley: \"Strings\" was too strong a choice. How about \"safeguards\"?",
        "Alan-Michael: Ah.",
        "Harley: All you have to do is sign this agreement, and then we can go ahead with the confirmation process.",
        "Alan-Michael: And in this contract, I'm agreeing to what?",
        "Harley: To be a decent guy. Which I don't think is that big a stretch for you. And I'd like to ensure Zach's part of the Spaulding legacy, and make sure that Dinah's job as your second doesn't go bye- bye. She's an asset to this company. It's in your hands.",
        "Alan-Michael: Can I get on with this now, then?",
        "Harley: Oh-- you're the boss. Ladies and gentlemen? Well, it seems that-- pending formal board approval, of course-- that Alan-Michael Spaulding will be your new CEO. (Applause) I'm sure he won't let us down. (Applause)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Well, what have I missed?",
        "Alexandra: A promotion. And a slap in the face.",
        "Alan: I'm not following you, Alexandra.",
        "Alexandra: Harley's stepping down as CEO.",
        "Alan: Hmm.",
        "Alexandra: And she has chosen your son to be her replacement.",
        "Alan: Really?",
        "Alexandra: Mmm.",
        "Alan: So she's plugging in Gus, huh?",
        "Alexandra: (Laughs) Your other son, dear.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Now, that wasn't so bad, was it?",
        "Alan-Michael: I guess everyone got what they wanted.",
        "Harley: Good, then we're all happy. And for the record, Alan-Michael, I do have faith in you. Try not to let me down. Tell me I didn't just make a huge mistake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: I-- hello --I appreciate your support, thank you.",
        "Alan: Congratulations, son. This has been a long time coming, hasn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Tammy doesn't need to be worrying about this right now.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah... I should be getting home, anyway. Get off my feet. Feel better, okay?",
        "Tammy: No, you can't leave like this. Not with you two so mad at each other.",
        "Jonathan: We're fine.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. You staying here?",
        "Jonathan: What do you think? You?",
        "Lizzie: I'm going home-- or... to the penthouse. Take my vitamins, feed Roxy, put my feet up.",
        "Tammy: We haven't moved into the penthouse yet. Unless I've been unconscious for weeks.",
        "Jonathan: No.",
        "Tammy: Then I need you to do something for me. Both of you. I need you to stick with what we started. And live together at the Beacon until I come home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim Zimmer \"Inside The Light.\" Reva is all about family and I think this baby represents an extension of family, and this wonderful, crazy family going on and going forward, so I'm just sorry that it has to be with Lizzie Spaulding, but... See Reva Wednesday, July 26, \"Inside The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Just rest a little, okay?",
        "Lizzie: We'll get the doctor to come look at you.",
        "Tammy: Just because I got knocked halfway into a coma doesn't mean that I'm a head case-- or an idiot. I know that I'm the one who's been making this whole living together deal work.",
        "Jonathan: Well, yeah. That's the whole thing. Now there's two of us and you're not one of them.",
        "Tammy: If we fall apart now, there'll be nothing to stop Alan. He'll go after the baby and make life a living hell for all of us all over again. You know it's true.",
        "Jonathan: Okay, okay. The only thing that's important right now is that you get better.",
        "Lizzie: And you will. Soon. You know, and then the three of us can start back up again. Think of this as like a...",
        "Jonathan: A break.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah.",
        "Jonathan: A little vacation.",
        "Tammy: Do you think Alan's going to take a break from making our lives hell? Forget about it.",
        "Jonathan: You really want this?",
        "Tammy: My boyfriend living with his baby mama? I know you must think I'm a glutton, but... I guess I'd be more worried if you guys actually liked each other.",
        "Jonathan: You're not giving up, are you?",
        "Tammy: Nope.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. Then we'll hang in there, too. Right?",
        "Lizzie: I guess.",
        "Tammy: Great. Then I want you to take Lizzie home and make sure she gets something to eat and gets some rest. Please?",
        "Lizzie: I'll wait for you in the hall.",
        "Jonathan: (Sighs)",
        "Tammy: What?",
        "Jonathan: When I think about what could have happened to you today...",
        "Tammy: Then don't. It was scary. But I feel safe now. Like I always do when I'm around you.",
        "Jonathan: I should feel like I'm... never mind.",
        "Mel: Well, here's someone I'm glad to see awake again. Hi.",
        "Jonathan: Hey.",
        "Tammy: Go take care of Lizzie.",
        "Jonathan: I will. I'll be back soon, okay?",
        "Mel: I need to examine Tammy. Alone.",
        "Cassie: Well-- but--",
        "Tammy: It's okay. It's okay, Mom. I'll be fine, I'll see you in a little while.",
        "Cassie: Well...",
        "Josh: Come on.",
        "Cassie: She still looks so pale.",
        "Josh: Well it's that flattering hospital lighting. (Laughs) What?",
        "Cassie: Just the way she talked to me in there, you know. Like she was the one taking care of me.",
        "Josh: Yeah, Shayne was like that after his car accident, after he got past the anger part, of course. He was at times more adult than Reva and I could have ever...",
        "Cassie: Josh, you don't... you don't have to tell me, of course, but I am kind of curious about Reva's call.",
        "Josh: Well, she's not coming home, if that's what you're asking. Yeah, that was the exactly the look on my face when she said, \"No, I can't possibly make it back,\"",
        "Cassie: Well, you did tell her...",
        "Josh: Yes, I told her about Tammy and it didn't seem to make a difference, so as far as I'm concerned, my priority now is taking care of Tammy and taking care of you.",
        "Cassie: It's just so not like Reva to... I mean, why did she call you, anyway?",
        "Josh: Actually, I haven't the faintest idea, and I think for the first time in my life I... I'm not sure that I care.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Billy, I have to go.",
        "Billy: I know, I know. But, you see, what are you going to do, help them? How much help are you going to be if you fall down dead just getting out the door, huh?",
        "Reva: Oh, go to hell.",
        "Billy: Okay. Look, darling. A thousand things can happen, and almost all of them at this point are not good.",
        "Reva: They need me at home.",
        "Billy: Yeah, they do need you. And we're going to get you home, but we're going to get you home so that you can spend a long time with them. Now, did you manage to tell Joshua what the score was?",
        "Reva: I never got the chance to.",
        "Billy: Okay. Well, let's make a chance. Hey. Here. Call Roxie or Shayne or Hawk, or anybody. Just call...",
        "Reva: Billy. The family is off limits. Promise me you won't call them. Promise me. You have to promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: So...",
        "Lizzie: What?",
        "Jonathan: Well, I guess we won't be needing these anytime soon.",
        "Lizzie: Guess not.",
        "Jonathan: Here we are. Mommy and daddy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: That went well, I think. What about you guys? I know, I should have given you a heads up, but I didn't make the decision to make the change until like ten minutes ago. Are you mad?",
        "Gus: Baby, I'm proud of you.",
        "Harley: That means we'll talk later.",
        "Gus: (Chuckles)",
        "Harley: I know you're probably mad because here I trashed your chance to be CEO once again, and I picked Alan-Michael, of all people.",
        "Dinah: Well, it's fine by me. It's fine by me.",
        "Harley: Yeah?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Yeah, because I'm happy. I'm getting married.",
        "Harley: Yeah.",
        "Dinah: And I'm having to plan a wedding which is practically a job in and by itself, you know, and speaking of which, I have an engagement party to go to and get ready for which would be a whole lot more fun than whatever the hell this was. See 'ya.",
        "Harley: See 'ya.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: So, Harley has anointed you her successor, huh? Well, I suppose that backing into power still counts.",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm boss and you're not. That's all that really matters. I'm sorry, no smoking in my house.",
        "Alan: Well, you know, son, I like to enjoy a nice Cuban cigar when I'm laying out a strategy. A strategy that could make a neophyte Spaulding CEO the most powerful man in Springfield. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Look at them. Thick as thieves.",
        "Harley: Maybe it's just a case of keeping your friends close but your enemies closer.",
        "Gus: Hmm. What's the matter, you don't want to stick around?",
        "Harley: No. It's his baby now. I know what I want.",
        "Gus: All right. Mmm. That was a good one.",
        "Harley: Thank you. I feel like I have a weight lifted off my shoulders, but I won't feel completely good about myself until I get out of this smelly old castle. Come on, there's someplace we need to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: Okay. So hit me with your brilliant strategies.",
        "Alan: You know, I wouldn't mock me if I were you, Alan-Michael, because you're going to need me.",
        "Alan-Michael: Wrong. No matter how the CEO job came, I've got it. I win.",
        "Alan: Not with your family crumbling all around you.",
        "Alan-Michael: Here we go with the old \"Spaulding's unite\" speech.",
        "Alan: I think you know that our family is having a lot of problems. The coopers are still a thorn in our side and Jonathan Randall has a stake in our future and our fortune ever since Elizabeth became pregnant with his baby. Elizabeth is a mess right now. She's very fragile, and that also affects her baby. Now, I challenge you to use this newfound power that you have to help the next generation.",
        "Alan-Michael: I'll make a note of that.",
        "Alan: You know, Harley may have endorsed you, but the board has to confirm you.",
        "Alan-Michael: Is that some kind of threat?",
        "Alan: No, no. I just think you should bear it in mind. There's no secret that I wanted Phillip for this job, yet you're still standing.",
        "Alan-Michael: So, you're ready to throw your full support to me with the board's old guard?",
        "Alan: I haven't decided yet.",
        "Alan-Michael: Well guess what, Dad? I don't really give a damn. I work alone.",
        "Alan: We'll see.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Why-- why do you want to come here so bad?",
        "Harley: I got to eat.",
        "Gus: So what, we're going to fuel up to foil the next robbery?",
        "Harley: Oh ho, lots of them, I hope.",
        "Gus: Oh, my g--",
        "Harley: Don't \"oh my gosh\" me.",
        "Gus: You're just... you need to slow down.",
        "Harley: I'm not going to slow down. Not about that. That was the right thing to do, I am sure of it. I have no regrets, none.",
        "Gus: Are you sure? Really, really sure? Because you looked like you were a little worried when you were going to tell Dinah and me on how we were going to react.",
        "Harley: Well, I didn't want you to be disappointed in me.",
        "Gus: Disappointed-- why, why- - why disappointed?",
        "Harley: Because you were the one who encouraged me to take the whole CEO thing in the first place, and here I am just throwing it away.",
        "Gus: Because, I want you to be happy. I want me to be happy, but mostly I want you to be happy. So if it makes you happy, you got my vote.",
        "Harley: See, I knew there was a reason that I married you.",
        "Gus: Yeah, that's good. And what will you be doing with all this free time that you're going to have on your hands?",
        "Harley: I don't know... maybe the police department's hiring?",

        "Lizzie: What? This is so stupid.",
        "Jonathan: What?",
        "Lizzie: How weird we're being. It's not like we haven't hung out before.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, once, and look what happened. Are you okay? Do you need anything?",
        "Lizzie: Like what?",
        "Jonathan: I don't know, food? Are you having, like, any bizarre-o cravings, or...?",
        "Lizzie: No, why, are you?",
        "Jonathan: I'm not the pregnant one, here.",
        "Lizzie: Oh... I could cook you something if you're hungry. (Laughs) I don't really cook, though.",
        "Jonathan: How about... this?",
        "Lizzie: No, wait-- what are you doing?",
        "Jonathan: I'm taking care of you, like Tammy told me to do. You got a problem with that?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, so stop!",

        "Cassie: How is she?",
        "Mel: Well, I still want to run some tests, but indications are that Tammy will make a full recovery.",
        "Cassie: Thank, God. (Relieved laugh)",
        "Josh: Can, can we... go in and see her?",
        "Mel: Yeah, just for a few minutes, though, she really needs to rest. You probably do, too.",
        "Cassie: Mmm.",
        "Mel: Okay?",
        "Josh: Thank you.",
        "Cassie: Thank you, Mel.",
        "Mel: Bye, you guys. (Cassie and Josh laugh in relief)",
        "Cassie: Everything's going to be okay.",
        "Josh: Yeah, there's nothing better than that, huh? (Laughing) You should go in. Go in, I'll just-- I'll wait out here for a bit.",
        "Cassie: Actually, you know, maybe you should just go home. I mean, there's really no need for you to be here now.",
        "Josh: How about this? I'll go to Company and get some food for Tammy and for you.",
        "Cassie: You don't have to bother.",
        "Josh: Have you eaten today?",
        "Cassie: No.",
        "Josh: Then I have to bother.",
        "Cassie: (Sighs) Okay, in that case, would you get me an order of fries. Thank you.",
        "Josh: No problem.",
        "R.J.: Uncle Josh!",
        "Josh: Hey! R.J., what are you doing here, buddy, huh?",
        "Mrs. Chitwood: Sorry. Mrs. Winslow asked me to bring R.J. here. She didn't explain why, but on the way over on the--",
        "R.J.: The radio said that Tammy got hurt really bad!",
        "Josh: Yeah, but you know what, she's okay. She's, she's awake now and everything, all right? So, she's going to be fine, you don't have to worry about anything. I'll take it from here. Thank you very much. Come here. Come here.",

        "Colin: Hey, how'd the call go with Reva's husband? What happened?",
        "Billy: She wants an anonymous donor.",
        "Colin: Wait, she didn't tell Josh? There's no blood relatives coming?",
        "Billy: She's not calling them.",
        "Colin: Okay, do you have any idea how much longer the chances are of trying to find someone-- a donor match from the pool than rather from her own family?",
        "Billy: She made me promise not to call them.",
        "Colin: You are both fools, man! Look, I appreciate the fact that you want to respect Reva's wishes, but do you really want to fold before you've had a chance to play all your cards?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Another lecture.",
        "Colin: No.",

        "Harley: Come on! Let's go down to the station and get my old job back. We'll gang up on Frank-- you love ganging up on Frank!",
        "Gus: Right there. You don't want me talking to Frank. He's hardly... he's not interested in what I got to say. We're not on the best of terms. And I don't-- why do you want to jump from the frying pan to the fire?",
        "Harley: Maybe police work will make me happy.",
        "Gus: I don't think you know when you're happy, babe. I thought you were happy when you were running the company.",
        "Harley: I was. Well, yes and no.",
        "Gus: Well, what's the \"no\" part?",
        "Harley: I was sleepwalking through that. Or sleep working, I should say.",
        "Gus: Yeah, all right, then... you realized this when?",
        "Harley: Today. Here! When we foiled that robbery. The way we took those guys down, that was instinct. Pure instinct, which is the opposite of what I used at Spaulding. Police work is gut work and it's... it's heart work, and I miss that.",
        "Gus: Well I said I support you, what?",
        "Harley: See, that's why I love you. It's that sort of middle of the road, whiny, you just want me to shut up, love.",

        "Lizzie: What?",
        "Jonathan: The whole \"playing nice\" bit.",
        "Lizzie: No, it's not. And I know why. There's only one reason you can stand me being here, and that reason is named Tammy.",
        "Jonathan: Can't argue with that.",
        "Lizzie: She's not even my friend. I mean, not really.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy wants you to be here.",
        "Lizzie: No, she tolerates my being here. Because I'm carrying your baby. I don't have anywhere else to go.",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie...",
        "Lizzie: Look, let's just be honest, okay? I'm not trying to make you feel bad, or anything, but... it's the truth.",
        "Jonathan: Things are... pretty messed up.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. (Sighs) I know you blame my granddad for Tammy being in the hospital, and, knowing him, you're probably right. Look, I feel awful about it, Jonathan, I do. I mean, my family... they're going after the only two people who are helping me.",
        "Jonathan: Well, it's not really your fault.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, but... maybe you guys will... say \"enough's enough\" and... figure out that I'm not really worth the hassle, kick me out on the street-- I mean, I wouldn't blame you.",
        "Jonathan: That's not going to happen.",
        "Lizzie: Why not? You don't even want the baby.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy and I are not going to kick you out.",

        "Tammy: No. I'm fine, I'm fine. Stop worrying about me. You're as bad as Jonathan.",
        "Cassie: Oh, now that is something I thought I'd never hear.",
        "Tammy: Isn't there something you were going to do later today?",
        "Cassie: You know what? Whatever, it doesn't matter.",
        "Tammy: What was it?",
        "Cassie: I was supposed to go to Dinah's engagement party.",
        "Tammy: Then go! Have fun.",
        "Cassie: But I would much rather stay here with you. You just want me out of here so I won't hover while you sleep. So did the Cubs win last night?",
        "R.J.: Mom!",
        "Cassie: Shh. Your sister's resting.",
        "R.J.: She's not even moving. Is she breathing?",
        "Cassie: Of course she is, honey, she's just asleep, that's all. She's going to be okay.",
        "Josh: There, you see, there's two of us said exactly the same thing: She's going to be okay. I'll tell you what, why don't I get you guys back to the house and I'll stick around for a little while until things settle down a bit.",
        "Cassie: I think... I think we'll be all right.",
        "R.J.: No! Mom. Can't Uncle Josh come over and stay? What if the bad guys that hurt Tammy come?",
        "Cassie: Honey, they won't. They won't. And... and he can come visit another time. I think we're all pretty tired right now.",
        "R.J.: Mom...",
        "Josh: R.J.. It's going to be okay, don't worry about it.",

        "Dinah: Listen, this confirms that Alan-Michael was behind the whole thing. He gets a top seat at Spaulding and he stops harassing me. Very clear.",
