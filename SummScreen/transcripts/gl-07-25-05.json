        "Edmund: Why is this place so deserted with the door open?",
        "Dinah: I don't know. Why is it so hot? I don't even get... I don't even want to start on how this is to carry this thing around.",
        "Edmund: I know. I know. But the whole ordeal is almost over, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: Hey, are they here yet?",
        "Edmund: Shhh.",
        "Tammy: I can't believe what they're saying. What are they even doing here?",
        "Dinah: There's not one thing I'm not beginning to hate about this whole thing. I just... I want it gone, Edmund. I want it gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Wait a minute.",
        "Jeffrey: What? What's the matter?",
        "Cassie: You're going to say no to me about the dinner cruise?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I told you I got a craving for a Buzz burger.",
        "Cassie: A Buzz burger?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: A burger over me, this dress, the stars, the cruise.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm addicted. What can I say?",
        "Cassie: You're addicted to Buzz burgers.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, come on. Come on. Come on.",
        "Cassie: I learn something new about you every day.",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, you do. Let's go. It's on me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Look, I am... I'm hot and I'm sweaty and I can't take this anymore. It's driving me crazy. I'm out of here.",
        "Jeffrey: What are you guys doing here?",
        "Edmund: Well, never a polite greeting. How are you?",
        "Cassie: Why is it dark in here?",
        "Tammy: Because it's a surprise baby shower.",
        "All: Surprise.",
        "Cassie: Surprise. Wow. Hi.",
        "Dinah: Hi.",
        "Edmund: Yes. Hello. I'm sorry. I didn't know that-- well, we just came by for something to eat. I'm sorry.",
        "Dinah: You know, we can go someplace else.",
        "Edmund: Yeah.",
        "Tammy: You're not going anywhere until you explain yourself. We all heard what you said. You owe it to my mom to tell her the truth about this baby right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Well, here we are. I'll just... yeah, do you have my cell phone? I know it's not a penthouse suite or anything. It's...",
        "Coop: No, it's great.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I feel I can breathe here, you know.",
        "Coop: Well, that's good. Because that's what I want from you. I want you to be able to breathe. But that's not the most important thing though. You're forgetting what's important.",
        "Lizzie: What's that?",
        "Coop: Well, it's the fact that there's no one here to hassle us about finally being together. So that means that there's no one to stop us-- or rather stop me.",
        "Lizzie: Stop you from what?",
        "Coop: Oh, I don't know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: I've had enough of this.",
        "Alan: He is alive! Phillip is alive.",
        "Harley: What did you just say?",
        "Gus: Ignore him. You don't give up, do you, dad?",
        "Alan: I'm telling you the truth, Gus. Your brother is alive.",
        "Harley: Alan, you are losing it.",
        "Alan: I shot him, Harley. That I admit. That horrible night has haunted me ever since. But the one thing that has kept me sane is the fact that I did not kill him. Now you have got to get me out of here. They can't hold me in this cell for a murder I didn't commit.",
        "Harley: He's crazy.",
        "Gus: You're very clever, Dad. I see what you're doing. You are laying the groundwork for an insanity defense, aren't you?",
        "Alan: If telling the truth is insane, I am guilty. And I know it sounds desperate, but Phillip is in Springfield. He's been here ever since that night. Don't you want to see him?",
        "Alan: I've been protecting him, keeping him safe.",
        "Harley: Safe from what, Alan?",
        "Alan: From all of you. It's been difficult and... he's in a very fragile state.",
        "Harley: Oh, please. I don't need to hear this.",
        "Alan: I'm telling you the truth, Harley.",
        "Harley: Really? Are you planning on telling the sad story to Lizzie? To Zach and James? You're going to spell it out for Emma?",
        "Alan: Those children deserve to have their father, Harley!",
        "Harley: Yes, they do, Alan. The one you took away from them.",
        "Alan: I had to.",
        "Gus: Okay. Hey, Honey, what if he's telling the truth?",
        "Harley: You don't believe that.",
        "Gus: Why not?",
        "Alan: I knew you would believe me, Son.",
        "Gus: No. You know, Dad, you're preaching the choir, okay? We appreciate you wanting to take us to go see him, but we saw him already-- at the gas station.",
        "Alan: Gus, no.",
        "Gus: Yeah, he was at the gas station complaining about prices and whatnot. Listen to me. I don't know whether you have one of those mental illnesses or you're just plain crazy. But you're going to pay for killing your son, because that's the way the world works. Got it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Well, I don't know what you think you heard Dinah say.",
        "Tammy: We all heard it.",
        "Blake: That's right, Dinah.",
        "Cassie: Okay, what's going on?",
        "Edmund: Well, it's really very simple... albeit somewhat complicated to say the least. But I can explain. I think you...",
        "Tammy: Why don't you let her talk? She was going on and on about how she just wants to get rid of the baby because it's such a huge hassle and it makes her fat.",
        "Dinah: I know that probably sounded awful. But I have had a rough day, and it's awfully hot outside.",
        "Edmund: Which is a perfectly normal reaction for a pregnant woman.",
        "Jeffrey: Is that what you were about to confess, Edmund?",
        "Edmund: I think I used the word \"explain.\"",
        "Dinah: Okay, I think this is awfully awkward. The truth is Cassie, I... I've not enjoyed this pregnancy as much as I've led you to believe. It's actually harder than I've ever imagined. And it's getting harder every day.",
        "Mel: Yep, your feet swell up, your back hurts.",
        "Blake: Can't sleep.",
        "Cassie: Did you think that I wouldn't understand?",
        "Blake: I just thought maybe you thought I would be the same old selfish Dinah.",
        "Tammy: Now who would say something like that?",
        "Dinah: You see this is what I'm trying to avoid, Tammy. I don't want to hurt anybody. I have a short fuse. I get a little cranky. I would like this baby out of me. That's all.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Maybe you are the same old selfish Dinah. But you are carrying a child, and that means a lot. And you know, I think that was probably the most honest you ever been with me. ( Laughs ) Thank you.",
        "Dinah: You're welcome.",
        "Beth: I'm sorry to interrupt. Tammy, could I have a word with you for a minute?",
        "Tammy: Uh, yeah.",
        "Beth: Have you seen Lizzie?",
        "Tammy: Why? Is she in trouble?",
        "Beth: Well, I hope not. But I have no idea where she is or what she's doing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Hmm. Are you thirsty?",
        "Coop: No. Not thirsty.",
        "Lizzie: Well, that's funny, because I am. I've got, um, cottonmouth kind of thing.",
        "Coop: Yeah. Sure.",
        "Lizzie: You know, it's funny why they call these thing minibars, because they have everything in them. Would you like some chocolate?",
        "Coop: No. Thank you.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. Roxy, she loves gumdrops. Takes her forever to eat one. I like chocolate better, though. But you can't give dogs chocolate, you know, it's suppose to be really bad for them.",
        "Coop: Lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: Orange, her favorite.",
        "Coop: Are you stalling?",
        "Lizzie: Stall? Why would I stall? What do I have to stall for?",
        "Coop: Well, uh, me. Are you stalling for me?",
        "Lizzie: Henry, what's the rush, okay? It's not a race.",
        "Coop: I know it's not a race. But this is the first time that we finally have a chance to be alone together.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I know, right. Yikes. I'm kidding. It's just... I'm the type of woman that likes to take things slowly, okay. I like to savor the moment. I like... I like music. I like music. Can we put some music on? ( Music playing )",
        "Coop: No. Come here. Have a seat. Come here. Look at me. You can tell me the truth, okay. You don't want to do this.",
        "Lizzie: No, that's not it. I do. It's just... I mean, I don't... do we have to talk about it? We're not French or anything. You know, we came in here to be together, so, you know, let's just do that.",
        "Coop: But we are. Lizzie, sitting here is us being together.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, stop pretending like you're writing some After School Special and you don't know what I'm talking about. Together... together. You know, that's why people come to hotels to, you know, to...",
        "Coop: Sometimes.",
        "Lizzie: Well, what else do you do?",
        "Coop: You order room service. You raid the minibar. You jump on the beds, make a mess, throw pillows. ( Laughter )",
        "Coop: I need to ask a question and feel free... um... ( Laughs ) Whew. Would this be... I mean... would I be your first?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Damn it, you have to believe me. Don't you want Phillip to be alive?",
        "Harley: The problem, Alan, is that we were all at his funeral.",
        "Alan: Because we did a very good job, Harley.",
        "Gus: Who is we?",
        "Alan: Dr. Wallace and me. Let me explain.",
        "Gus: Go ahead. You've got about a minute. How's that?",
        "Alan: Okay, you know that I went to Company that evening to stop Phillip from taking the children. You know that he taunted me. He told me that he would take them away, that I would be left with nothing, all alone.",
        "Harley: Yes, we know. So you shot him. We know this part, Alan.",
        "Alan: Yes, I shot him. I shot him because I had to.",
        "Gus: Again, debatable.",
        "Alan: Listen to me. That's was only the beginning though. Because when we went to Cedars, I ran into Dr. Wallace, and Dr. Wallace had done some research for Spaulding Foundation before, and he said that he could save Phillip. With the horror and the confusion of that evening, I knew that if Phillip survived, you would all crucify him. You would send him to prison and he would be lost to me forever.",
        "Gus: This is a very creative story.",
        "Harley: No, no. No. Please go on. Then what?",
        "Alan: Wallace told me that he would help me out for a price. He told me that he would keep Phillip under the radar, fake a death certificate, fake a body at the funeral.",
        "Harley: So Wallace was your accomplice? Well, Wallace is dead. Did you kill him, too?",
        "Alan: You know, Harley, for someone who doesn't believe this story, you certainly ask a lot of question. But you haven't asked the one question that you want the answer to.",
        "Harley: Where is he?",
        "Alan: Phillip is safe. I have been taking care of him. But he is very delusional.",
        "Gus: Oh, well, he's not the only one.",
        "Alan: Listen to me. With me in here, I cannot pay to have his caretakers take care of him.",
        "Gus: Oh, my god. I can't take this story anymore.",
        "Alan: Listen to me. Listen to me. Harley, he is a very sick man. And if he is let go, he will want to hurt you more than anyone else. Do you want him out there to finish the job that he started?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I am not... I'm not a virgin.",
        "Coop: Okay. Oh... look, I'm sorry.",
        "Lizzie: I have had a lot of experiences.",
        "Coop: Experiences?",
        "Lizzie: Well, I'm not a ho bag or anything. But I mean I... I know how to...",
        "Coop: To have an experience?",
        "Lizzie: Don't make fun of me, Coop.",
        "Coop: I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not making fun of you. I'm just saying that if this is your first time, look, it doesn't have to be if you don't want it to be, that's all I'm saying.",
        "Lizzie: It's not.",
        "Coop: I just don't want us to try and trick each other anymore, okay. I don't want us to hide from each other.",
        "Lizzie: I'm not hiding from you anymore.",
        "Coop: I know. I know that. Here. Come here. I know you're not hiding.",
        "Lizzie: So, if we were to, you know, be together tonight...",
        "Coop: Which we don't have to be.",
        "Lizzie: Why do you keep doing that? It's like you don't want to. It's like you're trying to get out of it. Like... like, oh, I thought Lizzie was so much more mature than she is. But she's really not.",
        "Coop: I didn't say that, did I?",
        "Lizzie: Okay, but, Coop, this could change a lot of things.",
        "Coop: Good. I hope it does change a lot of things it should.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, aren't you worried about that?",
        "Coop: Well, aren't you?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, okay, so you admit it. It's like all those times when you looked down on me and said you'd get... you know what? I'm going to bathroom. Do not even try to stop me.",
        "Coop: Lizzie... ( Door slams ) Lizzie? You do realize that's the closet, right?",
        "Lizzie: ( Sighs )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: Beth.",
        "Beth: Hi, Blake. Mel, it's... you look great.",
        "Mel: You, too.",
        "Beth: So I guess I walked in on something. Baby shower.",
        "Mel: Yep, for Cassie. Well, take care.",
        "Beth: Mel?",
        "Mel: Beth, let's... let's not.",
        "Beth: I just never had the chance to tell you how sorry I was for what Rick...",
        "Mel: Rick and I are working our way back to solid ground.",
        "Beth: It was just difficult after Phillip's death.",
        "Mel: Listen, Beth, we don't have to talk about this. Okay, we don't have to understand each other. Rick's love for you is like an old picture in a shoebox. I don't mind when he takes it out and looks at it once in awhile, because I know he's going to put it back in the box where it belongs.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: You should get back to the party.",
        "Cassie: You should stay.",
        "Dinah: Cassie, nobody wants me hanging around.",
        "Cassie: You're doing all the work carrying my child. At least we could do is give you a glass of milk and a piece of cake.",
        "Dinah: Okay... sure.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Great. Well, then let's get this shower started. Whew! Okay. Get some cake.",
        "Jeffrey: Hey, listen, I'd love to stay and you know, talk about all these cute baby gifts, you know, the shoes and everything. But I really...",
        "Cassie: But your job is done and you lied your butt off to get me here.",
        "Jeffrey: That's right. You know what? I'm using my powers of persuasion for very good purposes.",
        "Cassie: Okay.",
        "Jeffrey: Got to go.",
        "Cassie: ( Laughs ) Thank you.",
        "Edmund: Well, Dinah, an inspired performance.",
        "Dinah: A shower for a baby that doesn't exist. That's just feels wrong.",
        "Blake: Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Blake. Oh, right, baby shower. Women only. Forgot.",
        "Blake: Come on.",
        "Edmund: Have a nice time.",
        "Cassie: ( Laughs ) Okay. Well, after everything that we've been through, our baby is being celebrated. I think that's wonderful.",
        "Edmund: You look lovely this evening, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Thank you.",
        "Edmund: Well, have a great night and I want to see all the presents afterwards.",
        "Jeffrey: You're playing a dangerous game, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Mr. O'Neill.",
        "Jeffrey: And you're playing with fire. You're going to get burned.",
        "Edmund: That was a fate you barely escaped.",
        "Jeffrey: But I'm not the one in the fire this time. You are. And I'm going to watch you burn.",
        "Edmund: And here I saved you from your fire. So who's the more ruthless man of two?",
        "Jeffrey: I'm not the one you should be worried about, Edmund. It's Dinah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: You're threatening me?",
        "Alan: No, Harley. I am offering advice. If Phillip goes free, it won't be safe for either one of you. How can I convince you?",
        "Gus: Dad, stop pretending to care about her all of a sudden, okay? She's going to be fine. We're getting married. And you're going to stay in this prison for the rest of your life because of what you did. And you're never going to get to see or know your grandchildren, okay?",
        "Alan: Well, you could cut me out if you want to, but Zach deserves to see his father.",
        "Gus: Dad, you're ill. And I'm going to get a doctor over here to talk to you or whatever, a shrink. And that's all I can do. Let's go. You're not starting to believe him, are you?",
        "Harley: Say I believe you and Phillip is alive. Where are you keeping him?",
        "Alan: I can see in your eyes that what I am telling you makes sense, doesn't it?",
        "Gus: She's done listening to you, Dad, okay? I'm going.",
        "Alan: Harley?",
        "Gus: Let's go.",
        "Alan: Harley?",
        "Gus: He's trying to trick us again. Please, let's just get out of the door.",
        "Alan: Look at me. Phillip is alive.",
        "Gus: Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.",
        "Alan: You have to believe me. Phillip is alive!",
        "Gus: That's hard.",
        "Harley: Wow. That was... that was some story, huh?",
        "Gus: Some lie. That man in there used to be my father. You okay?",
        "Harley: Are you?",
        "Gus: Honey...",
        "Harley: Have to kind of laugh. ( Laugh ) I mean, that's... that's like the worst thing that he's ever tried to pull, right? Hey, are you sure you're okay?",
        "Gus: Yeah, yeah. I'm all right. I've got some stuff I got to take care of. So...",
        "Harley: What stuff?",
        "Gus: Life-together stuff. Your car's here, right? So you're cool. I'm going to split.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Your only link to Cassie is that baby that Dinah is carrying.",
        "Edmund: And I'm looking out for Dinah.",
        "Jeffrey: You're using Dinah. And you're twisting her feelings for you every chance that you get.",
        "Edmund: That's ridiculous.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm just trying to help you out here, Edmund. Keep you safe and sound.",
        "Edmund: Is that right?",
        "Jeffrey: You know the last guy that Dinah was nuts about was Hart. And he ripped her heart to shreds. Now he's six feet under. Have a nice night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Well, it must be hard hanging out here, looking at all the baby stuff, then realizing what you have to give up.",
        "Dinah: Are you feeling bad for me, Cassie?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I guess I am.",
        "Dinah: Well, I hate you.",
        "Cassie: ( Laughs ) I know.",
        "Dinah: And you hate me, too. You have no idea how hard you're making all of this.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I do.",
        "Dinah: No, you don't.",
        "Cassie: Dinah, you have done an amazing job with this pregnancy. You have. When I first found out about this... ( Laughs ). Man, I thought it was the worst thing in the world. But here we are.",
        "Dinah: Here we are.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, and it's been incredible, and you've really come through.",
        "Dinah: You know, good practice for when I have my own someday, right?",
        "Cassie: You will.",
        "Dinah: Do you really think so?",
        "Cassie: Look, despite how it happened, I don't know if I will ever be able to thank you for carrying my child. So I guess the only thing I can say to you is we're even. ( Knock at the door )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Lizzie, please come out.",
        "Lizzie: No, I'm not coming out of here.",
        "Coop: This is so stupid. Lizzie, there's nothing wrong with being A... you- know-what.",
        "Lizzie: Really? That's funny. Because you can't even say the word.",
        "Coop: Oh, God, Lizzie, I just don't want to embarrass you anymore. That's...",
        "Lizzie: News flash, Coop: Too late.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, we have to work this out, okay? But there's no way we could do that with you on that side of the door. We need you to come out of the... you- know-where. You know what? Fine. Fine. I'm just going top go ahead and talk to the door. I'm going to call him Jim. He used to be part of the doors or something. I hope that sounds good. Jim, I got a problem. So you've got to listen up for second. It's about a girl. It's about the girl. Actually I'm totally into her. And the problem is that she's the kind of girl who puts up roadblocks all the time. Well, one minute things are fine, totally peachy, everything's cool and the next minute it's like ( Siren sound ). Hold on a second. Power shield's up. Get defensive. It's like she wants people to think that's she's mean and cold. But there's been something that's been bugging me, though. Every once in a while, I'll get glimpses to how she really is. You know, she'll let herself go a little bit. And as it turns out she's... she's kind of beautiful on the inside.",
        "Lizzie: Only kind of?",
        "Coop: I guess all I want to know is that... I don't know. No matter what people say, I'm never going to let her down. And I do know the truth. Lizzie Spaulding picked me. And I am picking her, too. I guess that's it.",
        "Lizzie: Wait. ( Coop laughs ) Thank you so much.",

        "Gus: Hello, Ladies. Don't mind me. I know you're busy.",
        "Blake: Where's Harley?",
        "Gus: She's coming any second. Just throwing out the trash.",
        "Beth: Gus?",
        "Gus: This thing on? There you go. Nice toasty fire. I was going to throw the real thing in there, but he's in jail.",

        "Harley: Say I believe you. And Phillip is alive. Where are you keeping him?",
        "Alan: You get me out of here, Harley, and I'll take you to him.",

        "Beth: Gus, what's going on?",
        "Gus: What's going on? Just that you don't have to worry anymore as far as this family's concerned. I'm going to watch out. Nothing else is going to fall apart-- not while I'm around.",
        "Beth: You're taking charge?",
        "Gus: Mm-hmm.",
        "Beth: I really don't think that that's necessary.",
        "Gus: Why's that?",
        "Beth: Well, no offense, but you're not the one to bring stability to this family. In fact, you could only complicate things.",
        "Gus: Is that right?",
        "Beth: Mm-hmm. You bring Harley and her whole family. And frankly, I'm trying to get Lizzie under control. The closer you bring Coop, the more complicated things become.",
        "Gus: Well, you don't mind me saying, because I think I probably the only one that would say this to you. Your daughter's trying, you know, to create her own her life. Maybe if you back off a little bit and she can learn to make her own mistakes.",
        "Beth: That's easy for you to say because you've never been a parent.",
        "Gus: Hmm.",
        "Beth: Gus, after everything that happened with Phillip, I'm not going to stand by and watch Lizzie make mistakes. I'm going to stop her before she does something that's unfixable. And like I said, it's not your problem.",

        "Cassie: Thank you. Thank you. This has just been amazing and fun and... and... wow. I was surprised. ( Laughter ) But obviously we couldn't be here without one very important person. And I really need to acknowledge her, because, well, she's made it all happen. And here's to Dinah.",
        "(All): To Dinah. ( Laughter )",
        "Mel: How about we open some more presents, huh?",
        "Cassie: Okay, presents. Right. All right.",

        "Ross: If your baby is a girl, you'll soon know where I'm coming from.",
        "Edmund: Yes, I suppose you're right.",
        "Ross: I mean, boys do have their issues, of course, but you have to watch out for the girls. Beware the girls, Edmund, because they own daddy. And pretty soon you find yourself defending them beyond all reason, taking any kind of a bullet for them. And you know something? You do this even when they're old enough to have children of their own. Beware the girls. Ah, there's my beautiful daughter!",
        "Dinah: Hey, Pop. Hi.",
        "Ross: Are you all right?",

        "Alan: You may not believe me, Harley, but you are here without Gus.",
        "Harley: That's because before I move on with my life, before I marry the love of my life, I have to find out if you're lying again.",
        "Alan: Then get me out of here and I will take you to Phillip.",
        "Jeffrey: Hello, Alan. What the hell's going on?",
        "Alan: So you've already called the DA, huh?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, she called the DA, and she told me the most unbelievable story I've ever heard, and I've heard them all.",
        "Alan: Well, it's true.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, if it's true, tell me where Phillip is.",
        "Alan: Get me out of here, and I will take you to him.",
        "Jeffrey: Alan, you know what? You're a claustrophobic. I believe that you will say anything to get out of there.",
        "Alan: I am not making this story up.",
        "Jeffrey: Fine. Then just tell me where Phillip is. I'll call someone right now; we'll send them over there and we'll check it out.",
        "Alan: No, no, I have to take you there.",
        "Harley: Oh, so that Sebastian can jump out of the shadows and bust you out again? No.",
        "Alan: Phillip has been in contact with no one but me. We can't have troopers storming in, knocking down the door. Have Frank send the men with me.",
        "Harley: I'm sorry. I need to know.",
        "Jeffrey: I'll make the call.",
        "Harley: ( Scoffs ) I cannot believe that I am doing this.",

        "Cassie: You're dying to say something, aren't you?",
        "Beth: Don't give him your heart.",
        "Cassie: So what if I already have?",
        "Beth: Then get it back before he breaks it.",

        "Dinah: You should have seen her. She was opening up presents; she was glowing; she even hugged me. She had everybody thank me.",

        "Dinah: No. That's what you want. I don't care how much you hurt, Cassie doesn't deserve this. Nobody deserves what you want to do.",

        "Dinah: She wants to forgive me. She wants to turn the page, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Dinah, Cassie is never going to forgive you.",
        "Dinah: Oh, yeah, she did. And I didn't realize how good it was going to feel. I felt lighter. People were kind to me because they wanted to be.",
        "Edmund: Dinah, Cassie doesn't care about you. The only thing she cares about is that baby she thinks you're carrying. You're here by mistake tonight. From Cassie's perspective, she has had no choice but to pat you on the head for the good little breeding dog you are.",
        "Dinah: I get it. I know that Cassie had to be nice to me tonight or otherwise she would look like a monster in front of everybody.",
        "Edmund: Dinah, I know how confusing this must be for you. But I want you to know that even though Cassie may think of you only as an incubator, to me there is no other woman in the world who can make me happy. Come here.",
