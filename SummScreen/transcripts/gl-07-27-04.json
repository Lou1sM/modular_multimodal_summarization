        "Harley: I don't know what's worse, the fact that you have been lying to gus \r\nfrom the start or the fact that you are still lying, still trying to save your \r\nsorry butt. It's over. Just admit what you did and get it done with. ",
        "Alexandra: I have nothing to admit, harley. ",
        "Gus: Hey, listen! Sorry, I can't let you do this anymore. ",
        "Alexandra: Gus, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. ",
        "Gus: No, I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to you. ",
        "Danny: Hey, reva. ",
        "Reva: Danny, hi. ",
        "Danny: How are you doing? Were you working late? ",
        "Reva: Um, actually, no. Josh is meeting a client and i am signing up for \r\nsalsa lessons. ",
        "Danny: Oh, salsa lessons. Wow. Good for you. Good for you. ",
        "Reva: Actually, I got the idea from michelle. ",
        "Danny: Michelle? ",
        "Reva: Mm-hmm. She just has this whole new energy and, I don't know, newness \r\naround her. ",
        "Danny: Oh, yeah. ",
        "Reva: It inspired me to kind of try something new for myself. ",
        "Danny: Yeah. Well, this newness is making me feel pretty old. ",
        "Reva: I know this can't be easy for you, danny. ",
        "Danny: You know, reva, I am all for michelle exploring, whatever, finding who \r\nshe is, whatever she wants to call it, but it's kind of difficult for me to give \r\nher her space, at the same time looking out for her, when I don't even know what \r\nshe's doing from one minute to the next. (Cell phone rings) it's ridiculous. \r\nExcuse me. ",
        "Reva: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Danny: Yeah? Speaking. Uh-huh. Wait, wait, hold on. My wife didn't buy a \r\nchair from your store. She did? And a what? (Music playing) ",
        "Everything's so blurry and everyone's so fake ",
        "and everybody's empty and everything is so messed up ",
        "preoccupied without you I cannot live at all ",
        "my whole world surrounds you I stumble... (cell phone ringing) yeah, hey, \r\nit's danny. I need to see you. It's michelle. She'S... something has to be done. \r\nOkay. Thanks, I'm on my way. ",
        "Lizzie: A car wash. Oh, right, for your spaulding project! That's a great \r\nidea, tammy. ",
        "Joey: Yeah, tammy. Who washes their car at night? ",
        "Tammy: The parking lot is lit up as light as day. I'll get people after \r\ndinner on their way home. ",
        "Joey: Whatever. ",
        "Lizzie: I'm sorry, tammy. I really am, okay? I didn't know you were going to \r\nbe here. Otherwise we would have went somewhere else. ",
        "Tammy: That's so considerate. ",
        "Lizzie: Well, it's the least I can do. I mean, we are... ",
        "Tammy: Friends? Is that what you were going to say? You need to stop using \r\nthat word, lizzie, because the last thing we are now is friends. ",
        "Buzz: Looks like harley and alexandra are about to duke it out. What \r\nhappened? ",
        "Alan: Oh, they're probably talking about frank, that's all. ",
        "Buzz: What about frank? ",
        "Alan: Well, his behavior tonight at the festivities, buzz, was reason enough \r\nfor discussion, I believe. ",
        "Buzz: I think it's a miracle that he held himself together so well. ",
        "Alan: Oh, yes. He was a model of self-control, wasn't he? ",
        "Buzz: The man was fired, set up to look like he was a dirty cop, not to \r\nmention the fact that he thinks there's a very good chance that you're the one \r\nthat framed him. ",
        "Gus: Excuse us. ",
        "Harley: You want me to back off, not her? ",
        "Gus: Yes. Yes, you heard me. ",
        "Harley: Okay, I understand that alex is a part of your family and I'm trying \r\nto work with that, but you have to understand that alex... ",
        "Gus: This is not about alex, okay? This is about you and me, and, babe, if \r\nyou keep going down this road, I'm afraid there's not going to be a you and me \r\nanymore. (Laughter) ",
        "Joey: Get out of here. Mrs. Lewis, I know what you're going to say to me. ",
        "Reva: Oh? ",
        "Joey: That I'm a piece of garbage for hurting tammy. ",
        "Reva: That may be what you think. Actually, joey, I was going to give you \r\nsome advice because i think you're going to need it. Have you ever heard the \r\nexpression \"hell hath no fury like a woman scorned\"? ",
        "Lizzie: Tammy, you know what? I didn't come here to fight with you tonight, \r\nall right? ",
        "Tammy: Right. Right, you just came here so that I could get an eyeful of you \r\nand joey together. ",
        "Lizzie: That's not true. I didn't even know you were going to be here. ",
        "Tammy: (Scoffs) right. You probably had your spies report in where I was \r\njust so you could accidentally show up with my boyfriend. ",
        "Lizzie: Uh, former boyfriend. ",
        "Tammy: Only because of you. ",
        "Lizzie: You know what, tammy? Go ahead and believe your fantasy that I stole \r\njoey from you, but you know what? I have news for you. I didn't have to steal \r\njoey. You lost him all on your own. ",
        "Reva: Joey, I can totally relate to a working class kid being given the \r\nopportunity to peek in on the house of spaulding and being wowed by it, because \r\nI was that kid. Different house, different time, but I spent a lot of hours of \r\nmy youth wanting in, wanting what those people behind those walls had. ",
        "Joey: No, mrs. Lewis, you got it all wrong. I'm not hanging out with lizzie \r\nbecause her family's loaded. I like her. ",
        "Reva: Well, that's fair. Just be careful. ",
        "Joey: Of what? ",
        "Reva: Of wanting things that you're not really quite sure you really want to \r\nbegin with. ",
        "Joey: I'm cool. Got it handled. ",
        "Lizzie: (Groans) ",
        "Tammy: Joey and me breaking up was 100% your fault-- no one else'S. ",
        "Lizzie: Fine, tammy, go ahead and blame it on me, like everyone else in this \r\nworld. Go! Come on! ",
        "Danny: I'm just going a little crazy here. ",
        "Rick: What, is this about michelle? ",
        "Danny: Yeah, who else? I am so sick of tiptoeing around her and pretending \r\nthat everything is okay. ",
        "Rick: Well, what happened? What's going on? ",
        "Danny: Rick, it's what happens every day. It's what happened tonight. She \r\ndisappears. She takes off without a word as to where she's going. Maybe if I'm \r\nlucky later on she'll tell me where she was and what she was doing, but for the \r\nmost part, I have no clue how she spends her time. Before I called you, I got a \r\ncall from that store... ",
        "Mel: Egans? ",
        "Danny: Egans. About some chair and bar set that she bought. ",
        "Rick: Women shop, danny. That's what women do. You're not upset about it? ",
        "Danny: She didn't bring the bar set and the chair to the house-- at least not \r\nour house. ",
        "Mel: Well, where are they? Where did she put them? ",
        "Danny: Who knows? I have no idea. It's the first I ever heard about it. This \r\nis what I'm saying, and this is what it's been like: One surprise after another. \r\nLast night, there was the tattoo. ",
        "Rick: Don't tell me she got a tattoo. ",
        "Danny: Oh, yes. You know, at least it's relatively tasteful. ",
        "Rick: Where is it? ",
        "Danny: It's some chinese character that means-- just wait-- \"ambition\" or \r\nsomething, right back here. ",
        "Rick: Oh, that's tasteful. ",
        "Danny: Yeah. Where the sun basically does not shine-- well, not lately. It'S... \r\nit'S... really, I can't take much more of this. ",
        "Rick: We can't lock her up, can we? ",
        "Danny: It's very tempting right now, believe me. Michelle has got to see what \r\nshe's doing. ",
        "Mel: How? ",
        "Danny: Well, I was hoping that you guys could maybe talk to her. Somebody has \r\ngot to talk to her, somebody who can listen and explain to her that what she \r\nreally needs to be doing right now is spending her time with her family. Someone \r\nhas to explain this to her, someone other than me, because we are obviously not \r\non the same wavelength about this. ",
        "Rick: You're in luck. ",
        "Danny: Why? ",
        "Mel: We're expecting my mother any minute now. ",
        "Danny: Felicia. ",
        "Rick: Mm-hmm. Who can listen and get through to somebody better than a \r\ntherapist? (Dance music qnaying) ",
        "Dj: Yo, people. ",
        "Here's the lady that's made ",
        "springfield a party town again. ",
        "Give it up for our hostess this ",
        "evening, michelle santos. ",
        "Come on. (Dance music playing) (cell phone ringing) ",
        "Michelle: Hey, handsome. ",
        "Danny: Hey. Well, you're in a good mood. ",
        "Michelle: Carpe diem. What's up? ",
        "Danny: Well, listen. I ran into rick and mel at towers, and they invited us \r\nto have dinner with them. So what do you think? Are you up for it? ",
        "Michelle: Sure. Why not? I'll be right there. (Music continues) ",
        "Danny: Okay, she's on her way. ",
        "Rick: I just hope michelle is okay with this. ",
        "Mel: I hope mom is okay with this. ",
        "Danny: Hey, it'S... it's just dinner with family. ",
        "Alan: Why on earth would i want to frame your son? ",
        "Buzz: Maybe wanting doesn't have anything to do with it. Maybe you had to, to \r\nprotect yourself or someone close to you. ",
        "Alan: That's absurd. ",
        "Buzz: Well, I'm not saying i believe it, but it's not out of the question for \r\na spaulding to do something like that if the stakes are high. Look at the \r\ndrastic measures you took to hush up maryanne's death. ",
        "Alan: You know, and you were with me, buzz, every step of the way. Excuse me, \r\nbut I thought tonight was about the coopers and the spauldings putting all of \r\nthat behind us, coming together. Your daughter, my son is getting married, and \r\nthe better we get along, the better off their future will be, buzz. ",
        "Buzz: Not just theirs. You know how I feel about your sister. I want us to \r\nhave a shot at happiness, which is another good reason that the spauldings and \r\nthe coopers should play nice. ",
        "Alan: Getting along begins with an act of good faith. ",
        "Buzz: I'll tell you what: If you swear that you had nothing to do with \r\nsmearing frank, I'll believe you. I'll do even better than that. I'll offer you \r\na deal. ",
        "Alan: And what's that? ",
        "Buzz: Well, we'll scrap all the history of the families with each other, \r\nokay? I mean, every sordid bit of it. Start over again fresh. ",
        "Alan: You would be willing to do that? ",
        "Buzz: For harley, absolutely. ",
        "Alexandra: I am going for a little walk. ",
        "Gus: Yes, that'S... that's a good idea. So... ",
        "Harley: You think this is about my spaulding phobia. You think my suspicion \r\nof them is what made me go after alex just now. ",
        "Gus: Well, it'S... you know, it's there. You can't really deny it. ",
        "Harley: Well, I've had good reasons, many of them. ",
        "Gus: Yes, babe, you have, and you're really good at dealing with this junk, \r\nand a million times better than you used to be. I'm just saying that there's a \r\nwedding coming up, and it's being planned by spauldings, and it's happening at \r\nthe spaulding mansion, and you're marrying a spaulding. And I feel it there, you \r\nknow? Especially when you look at me. ",
        "Harley: This isn't about you. You are nothing like those people. ",
        "Gus: No, I beg to differ. I am one of those people; I am a spaulding. ",
        "Harley: Okay, by blood. But your actions and your heart, I mean, you're a \r\nwhole different species. ",
        "Gus: No, I... I... I'm one of them, okay? And really, the bottom line is, if \r\nyou do not trust them, well, then you shouldn't really be trusting me. ",
        "Harley: There are some days that you are the only person in the world that I \r\ndo trust. ",
        "Gus: Oh, you've got to get out of the house a little more often. ",
        "Harley: Honey... (laughs) I'm sorry that you saw me tangle with alex. I \r\ndon't want to worry about your family, and I don't want you to worry about your \r\nfamily either. All that matters is you and me, what we have. Everything else, we \r\ncan just tackle... ",
        "Gus: I'll do it after the wedding. ",
        "Harley: After the wedding. ",
        "Gus: Yes. ",
        "Harley: Which cannot happen soon enough for me. ",
        "Gus: Good. Good. Well, then, there's something that we have to do first. ",
        "Lizzie: Joey, we should probably get back to my house and work on the \r\nproject, don't you think? ",
        "Joey: Yeah, good idea. Bye, mrs. Lewis. ",
        "Reva: Drive carefully. ",
        "Lizzie: Oh, he doesn't need to. Bruno is driving us. ",
        "Joey: Bruno. ",
        "Tammy: Well, in case you were wondering, joey and I are history. ",
        "Reva: I kind of picked up on that. And your mother told me. ",
        "Tammy: Oh, lizzie spaulding is such a rat! ",
        "Reva: You think she took joey away from you? ",
        "Tammy: She definitely did. I just... I don't know how. ",
        "Reva: You have no idea at all? ",
        "Tammy: Well, it's not like i didn't screw up with joey. I did, I admit it. \r\nBut he still had feelings for me. ",
        "Reva: How do you know? ",
        "Tammy: Joey and I danced together at this party the other night. Okay, well, \r\nI sort of set the whole thing up, but once it got going, it was so nice, you \r\nknow? Just like it always used to be. The next thing I know, he's kissing lizzie \r\nand looking at me like I have rabies. I know what you're going to say. I know, \r\nI'm young, I'll get over it, I'll probably break a few hearts of my own, blah, \r\nblah, blah. ",
        "Reva: Actually, no, that's not what I was going to say. Um... it's valid, but \r\nthat has to be the route you want to take if that's the route you want to take.\r\n",
        "Tammy: As opposed to... ",
        "Reva: Well, I don't know. Revenge? ",
        "Mel: Long day at work? ",
        "Felicia: Long and crazy. You should excuse the expression. (Laughter) I'm \r\nsorry I'm late. ",
        "Rick: No problem. Don't worry about it. ",
        "Felicia: Well, it's good to see you, danny. ",
        "Danny: You, too. You, too. It's been a while. ",
        "Felicia: Well, I can finally take off my doctor's hat and put on my family \r\nhat. ",
        "Rick: Um... ",
        "Felicia: Is... is something wrong? ",
        "Mel: Michelle is going to be joining us later. ",
        "Felicia: Well, what does that have to do...? Oh. You had a working dinner in \r\nmind. ",
        "Danny: No, no, no. Please, nothing that formal. We just... we're thinking \r\nthat it might be good for michelle to talk to someone like you. ",
        "Felicia: Someone with a degree in psychology? ",
        "Danny: A neutral observer... ",
        "Rick: Somebody with a degree in psychology. ",
        "Felicia: All right, all right. ",
        "Danny: ...With a degree in psychology. ",
        "Felicia: Danny, I'll be happy to speak with michelle. I think this is a \r\npositive sign that she's open to discussing the issues facing her. Well, she is \r\nopen to it? Isn't she? ",
        "Mel: Hopefully. ",
        "Rick: Yeah. ",
        "Felicia: Oh, no. If you're planning to set this woman up, the only thing I'll \r\nsay to her is \"pass the butter.\" ",
        "Danny: Felicia, I totally get what you're saying, I do. But I'm in a jam \r\nhere, and I do not know what else to do. I really need help in getting through \r\nto michelle because if i don't, I just... I have a feeling that there'll be \r\ntrouble. ",
        "Frank: All right, maynard. One more time, my good man. ",
        "Bartender: Sorry, chief. I'm cutting you off. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, very funny. Come on, just fill it up. ",
        "Bartender: Believe me, I'm doing you a favor. You've had enough. ",
        "Frank: You know what? I don't need a favor. I just need a drink. ",
        "Gus: Harley cooper, will you marry me? ",
        "Harley: I'm having a deja vu. (Laughs) ",
        "Gus: Tonight? ",
        "Harley: What? ",
        "Gus: I thought I wanted, you know, a big wedding and everything, but as it \r\nturns out, I really only want you. And I don't think I can wait another minute.\r\n",
        "Harley: Not even till tomorrow. ",
        "Gus: Well, that's the thing. You see, we both have our fathers inside, right? \r\nAnd there's plenty of food, and there's actually a judge that i know that owes \r\nme a favor, so i say we call him up here and get him down here and we do thishim \r\ndown here and we do this thing tonight. Tonight. What do you say? ",
        "Tammy: Coming up on \"guiding ",
        "light\": ",
        "Danny: Is everything okay? ",
        "Michelle: This was all your idea, wasn't it? You set me up! ",
        "Harley: Stay away from my father. ",
        "Alexandra: Are you asking me to break it off with buzz? ",
        "Harley: I'm telling you. Oprah: Singer george michael's ",
        "Frank: Maybe you didn't hear me. I said I needed a drink. ",
        "Bartender: Hey, man. Come on. ",
        "Frank: Do you have a problem? Why can't you get me a drink? ",
        "Rick: Excuse me. Excuse me. Frank, what's the problem? Is this guy giving you \r\ntrouble? ",
        "Frank: I'll tell you what the problem is. Yeah. He's not getting me a drink!\r\n",
        "Rick: Okay, I'll take care of him. Just settle down. Take it easy. ",
        "Frank: Well, that was fun. So where's my drink now? ",
        "Rick: How about I just get you out of here? Listen, you've got harley's \r\nwedding tomorrow. Did you forget about that? ",
        "Frank: I wish I could. ",
        "Rick: Well, let me just do this. Let me take you to company. Your dad's over \r\nthere, right? ",
        "Frank: Oh, yeah, yeah. They're all over there. They're all just having fun \r\ncelebrating and everything else. ",
        "Rick: Well, good. That's great, frank. You'll fit right in. All right, just \r\nhang right here. I'll be right back. (Clears throat) guys, frank's had a \r\nlittle too much to drink so I'm going to have to take him to company, but I'll \r\nbe right back. I'm sorry about this. Okay? ",
        "Danny: Okay. Felicia, I'm really sorry to be putting you on the spot like \r\nthis. Michelle is going to be here any minute. ",
        "Felicia: Well... ",
        "Danny: But do you think you can help me out with this? ",
        "Felicia: Danny, why do you think that her behavior would lead to trouble? ",
        "Danny: All I can say is that it already has. ",
        "Mel: Mom, danny isn't the only one who's trying to help michelle. The whole \r\nfamily could use some guidance. ",
        "Felicia: All right. I'll talk to her. ",
        "Danny: All right, thank you. ",
        "Felicia: But I won't press. ",
        "Danny: No. ",
        "Michelle: I got here as quick as I could. ",
        "Mel: Hey, michelle. ",
        "Danny: That was fast. ",
        "Michelle: Where's rick?W72 ",
        "Danny: Yeah, oh, he had to run off for a minute, but he'll be right back. \r\nSo... all right, I'm guessing you don't remember felicia, mel's mother. ",
        "Michelle: You're guessing i don't remember? ",
        "Danny: You know what I mean. Come on. ",
        "Felicia: It's good to see you again, michelle. ",
        "Michelle: Thanks. ",
        "Felicia: So how are you doing? ",
        "Michelle: Aside from total memory loss, perfect. So, felicia, what do you do? \r\nI mean, everybody in my family seems to be a doctor, so are you a doctor, too?\r\n",
        "Reva: What was that saying? \"Living well is the best revenge.\" ",
        "Tammy: Has that worked for you? ",
        "Reva: I am the walking poster child for it. If I had let all of the \r\nheartbreak and disappointments get to me, I'd be a really bitter woman right \r\nnow. But instead, I'm signing up for salsa lessons, woo! (Laughs) ",
        "Tammy: Okay... ",
        "Reva: I'm not saying that dancing lessons are for you, or even that joey is, \r\nbut there's always a way to make yourself a winner, tammy. Always. ",
        "Tammy: Well, all I've got going right now is this car wash, and so far \r\nbusiness sucks. ",
        "Reva: Well, you know, that could be because you're in here, and the cars are \r\nout there. ",
        "Tammy: I don't know. I think it's going to take a little bit more than \r\nmanpower to make this operation a winner. ",
        "Reva: What about womanpower? ",
        "Tammy: What? ",
        "Reva: Isn't alan always drilling into you intern wannabes the do's and don'ts \r\nof success? About using everything possible to make a splash. ",
        "Tammy: Splash? For the car wash business? You know, that's good, aunt reva.\r\n",
        "Reva: Well, yeah! And it doesn't even just work in your business; it works in \r\nall business. You have to learn to use your brains and your instincts and \r\nwhatever you have as a woman, in you or on you or around you, to get those dirty \r\ncars rolling back your way. Think of it that way. ",
        "Tammy: Yes! Yes! Womanpower! Aunt reva, you're the best. Thank you! ",
        "Beth: Lizzie? I just saw joey in the hall. I thought the two of you were \r\nworking at the beacon tonight. ",
        "Lizzie: We were until we ran into tammy. ",
        "Beth: Oh. Awkward, was it? ",
        "Lizzie: Mom, it was horrible. You know, the thing I don't get most of all is \r\nthat when you look in his eyes, you can see that he hates tammy. But then when \r\nthey're around each other, it's like they just get sucked in. ",
        "Beth: Well, maybe he doesn't hate her as much as you think he does. Lizzie, \r\nif tammy and joey still have feelings for each other, you need to back off. ",
        "Lizzie: No way, mom! ",
        "Beth: Okay, okay. Where do things stand between you and tammy? ",
        "Lizzie: She said we weren't friends anymore. ",
        "Beth: Oh, lizzie! ",
        "Lizzie: No, you know, that's just the way things go. You know, one minute \r\nyou're best friends and the next... ",
        "Beth: Over a guy? ",
        "Lizzie: You know, I'm not sorry, though, mom. Joey is an incredible guy, and \r\nif tammy couldn't keep him interested, that's her problem. ",
        "Beth: Well, it could be your problem, too. You don't want to be the rebound \r\ngirl, do you? ",
        "Lizzie: I'm not going to be, mom, okay? Joey and I are doing better right now \r\nthan tammy and him ever did. ",
        "Beth: Honey, you just said she still gets to him. ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, but it doesn't mean anything. It's just... it's annoying. \r\nBelieve me, joey is over tammy completely. ",
        "Beth: (Sighs) ",
        "Lizzie: What, now you think I'm in denial? ",
        "Beth: No, I'm not saying that. And if tammy and joey have truly broken up, \r\nand you have feelings for him, you have every right to pursue him. ",
        "But... ",
        "Lizzie: Good! I am so glad you understand. I knew you would. (Sighs \r\ncontentedly) ",
        "Alexandra: Is everything all right? ",
        "Buzz: You tell me. You were the one that was going toe-to-toe with harley.\r\n",
        "Alexandra: Oh. Well, that was just a little disagreement over seating \r\narrangements at the wedding. ",
        "Buzz: Well, I can't see my daughter getting so worked up about who sits \r\nwhere. ",
        "Alexandra: Well, you'd be surprised at how some things become very, very \r\nimportant at this time. ",
        "Buzz: Yeah. They do, don't they? ",
        "Alexandra: What? ",
        "Buzz: Certain things have made me think. ",
        "Alexandra: Mm. ",
        "Buzz: Now, I know you rub each other the wrong way, you and harley, but what \r\nyou've done, planning this wedding, that's special. ",
        "Alexandra: Oh, well. You know what this is. It's a major event in this \r\nfamily. I could hardly give it short shrift, could I? ",
        "Buzz: It's more than that. I mean, frank and I could have thrown a bash. But \r\nwith nadine gone, you know, she misses her mom, and I think that's why you \r\noffered to lend a hand, and I cannot find the words to tell you how much i \r\nappreciate that. Especially since the family is all torn up about what frank's \r\ngoing through. Oh, forget about the words. Come here! ",
        "Alexandra: Oh! ",
        "Harley: You're a liar. ",
        "Gus: What? ",
        "Harley: You don't want to get married tonight for love's sake. This is about \r\nalexandra. ",
        "Gus: (Clears throat) ",
        "Harley: Oh, yeah. Because you saw me telling her off and you figured, \"you \r\nknow what? If I marry this crazy cooper tonight, I can get her back on track, \r\nget her focused on my love for her and spare her a day of nerves and tears and \r\ndrama,\" because you're always thinking of me. And I'm always thinking of you. \r\nAnd because of that, we have this huge event planned. ",
        "Gus: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Harley: Everybody is going to be there. I say let's do it. Let's do it right, \r\nyou know? Let's have the day, and let's remember it for the rest of our lives.\r\n",
        "Gus: Okay. ",
        "Harley: I want to do it tomorrow. ",
        "Gus: Yes, yes. That's the way it's going to be. ",
        "Harley: (Laughs) ",
        "Gus: All right? That's what we're going to do. That's what we're going to do. \r\nI love you so much. ",
        "Harley: I love you. ",
        "Gus: I really do love you. ",
        "Harley: I love you. ",
        "Frank: I'm serious, rick. It's not just the crap about my job. It's about my \r\nfamily. It's about the spauldings. It's about this stinking mess of a wedding. \r\nRick, my sister, she deserves to be happy; she truly does. She's such a good \r\nperson, but you know what? She's going to make another mistake, I know it, by \r\nmarrying another spaulding. Are you kidding me? A union of two families, this \r\nbig event? Well, you know what? It's a joke! It's a big joke! It's nothing but a \r\npack of lies and fake promises! ",
        "Frank: Oh, sis, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. ",
        "Harley: That's what you think? That my wedding is a joke? ",
        "Frank: No, no, no. I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it. ",
        "Rick: Harley, you need to give him a break. He's been drinking. ",
        "Frank: Sis, come on! ",
        "Harley: Gus is a good guy. You know that. He's the only good thing to come \r\nout of that family. ",
        "Frank: I'm sorry. ",
        "Harley: Could you take him inside? ",
        "Frank: I'm sorry. I really am. Come on!9 I just want her to know... i want \r\nher to know how much I... how sorry I am, how much I love her! She knows! ",
        "Darci: Frank, what's going on here? ",
        "Buzz: What did you say to her? ",
        "Frank: I didn't mean it. I just... I just want to help her! ",
        "Harley: It's okay. I'm just freaking out a little bit. ",
        "Frank: (Yelling) ",
        "Gus: You just go inside. I'll wait with her. ",
        "Harley: Could you go inside, please? I just... please? ",
        "Frank: I need to talk to her. I need to make it right. ",
        "Darci: Frank, you need to calm down. ",
        "Buzz: You've done enough. ",
        "Darci: Come on. ",
        "Gus: You see what this is doing to harley? ",
        "Alan: It's not your fault, gus. ",
        "Gus: Really? It's just one of those things? Is that right? ",
        "Alan: No, no, no, no. Frank is drunk. He was just shouting off at the mouth, \r\nthat's all. ",
        "Gus: It's not like he doesn't know what he's talking about. Lies, lies. It \r\nfeels pretty familiar. ",
        "Alan: Now, look, don't do this to yourself, all right? Come on. ",
        "Gus: I had every chance to make it right. I just keep it up. I keep the thing \r\ngoing. I did it again just now. I did it outside with her just now. ",
        "Alan: Okay, enough. Enough, all right? ",
        "Gus: It should be enough. You know what I did? I guilt-tripped her just now. \r\nI said, you know, \"I want to marry you tonight,\" and I made it seem like it was \r\nout of love, but it wasn't for that. It was because I wanted to distract her \r\naway from you and alexandra. I'm getting good. I'm getting good. You proud of \r\nme? ",
        "Michelle: So, uh... did we always do this? You know, this q & a thing? ",
        "Felicia: Not really. But, hey, who's to say we can't? ",
        "Michelle: Who is danny talking to? All right, what's going on, guys? What's \r\nthe matter? ",
        "Mel: Nothing. ",
        "Felicia: Look, if you ever feel like you really do want to talk, give me a \r\ncall. ",
        "Michelle: You're a shrink. ",
        "Mel: Michelle... ",
        "Michelle: That's why I'm here, right? ",
        "Felicia: No. ",
        "Michelle: Are you even her mother? Are you? ",
        "Felicia: Of course I'm her mother. Look, this was not intended to set you up. \r\nWe were friends. I'm here to help you, michelle. ",
        "Danny: What's going on? Is everything okay? ",
        "Michelle: This was all your idea, wasn't it? You set me up! ",
        "Alexandra: Harley, are you all right? ",
        "Harley: My brother thinks my wedding is a farce. My future aunt-in-law is a \r\ndrug smuggler. The only good thing is that gus did not hear darci call you mrs. \r\nGodfrey. He doesn't know that brad green was trying to name you, and i won't \r\ntell him, yet. ",
        "Alexandra: Harley, harley... ",
        "Harley: Are you looking forward to tomorrow, alexandra? I am. I am marrying \r\nthe greatest guy in the world in front of my children and my friends and my \r\nfamily, your family, too. And I want it to be the best day in gus's life, \r\nbecause the day after tomorrow, that might not be so terrific. ",
        "Alexandra: What are you going to do? ",
        "Harley: I'm going to tell. I'm going to tell ross or jeffrey o'neill-- \r\nsomeone, i don't know who. But this isn't over, not by a long shot. And in the \r\nmeantime, if you so much as think about springing another surprise on my \r\nbrother, it will be the sorriest day of your life. That is a promise. ",
        "Alexandra: Is that all? ",
        "Harley: No. Stay away from my father. ",
        "Alexandra: Are you asking me to break it off with buzz? ",
        "Harley: I'm telling you. ",
        "Danny: Michelle! Hey, come here. Take it easy. This is not some kind of \r\nconspiracy. ",
        "Michelle: Gee, that's a word I hadn't even come up with yet. ",
        "Danny: Michelle, felicia happens to be... ",
        "Michelle: Is a shrink! ",
        "Danny: She's a member of our family. ",
        "Michelle: Oh, who just happened to be here at the dinner that rick and mel \r\ninvited us to. ",
        "Danny: Michelle... ",
        "Mel: Michelle, danny is just concerned that your recovery go as well and as \r\nsmooth as possible, okay? We all want that. ",
        "Michelle: Do I seem lost to you? Do I? Do I seem helpless? I am taking care \r\nof myself, okay? The only problem I have is all this help that my family keeps \r\nshoving down my throat. ",
        "Danny: I was just trying to connect with you. To get closer. That's all I'm \r\ntrying to do. ",
        "Michelle: Well, that's not how you do it. Maybe the old michelle, maybe she \r\nwould have gotten off on being probed during the pasta, but not me, okay? I'm \r\nout of here. Come on, danny! Come on! Are you going to follow me? Because I \r\nmight do something crazy! ",
        "Tammy: Whoo! Womanpower! It worked! I am the queen of car washing. ",
        "Reva: Well, your majesty, you seem to have left your clothes someplace. ",
        "Tammy: Aunt reva, you're a genius. I did just what you said, and look. The \r\nmoney is rolling in! ",
        "Reva: I am definitely looking. Honey, I'm glad my advice gave you ideas, \r\nbut... ",
        "Tammy: I'm just getting started. ",
        "Reva: It's not... ",
        "Tammy: I have big plans. First I'm going to win this spaulding contest, no \r\nmatter what it takes, and then I'm going to get joey back. All thanks to you, \r\naunt reva. ",
        "Lizzie: See? Who wouldn't want to buy joey lupo's first cd with a \r\npresentation like that, huh? ",
        "Joey: It's not really a cd cd. It's more like, I don't know, me pressing some \r\nsongs together. ",
        "Lizzie: Quit selling yourself short. That is an amazing talent you have. We \r\nmake such a great team. ",
        "Joey: Good enough to win the contest? ",
        "Lizzie: Definitely. ",
        "Joey: Oh, gosh. It would be so sweet winning a scholarship to college. ",
        "Lizzie: And don't forget a position in the family business. ",
        "Joey: Uh, lizzie, it's your family business. ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. ",
        "Joey: Yeah. You said \"the\" family business, like it was both ours. ",
        "Lizzie: Okay, whatever. ",
        "Joey: Um, I'm going to go try to cell some of these cds. Wish me luck. ",
        "Lizzie: Oh, I can do better than that. Hi, this is lizzie spaulding. Yeah, I \r\nwas noticing that they were having a car wash over at the beacon, and I don't \r\nreally think they have any permits./7y yeah, so I think maybe we should enforce \r\nspringfield's zoning laws, don't you think? I agree. Thank you so much for your \r\nhelp. Bye. (Sighs) ",
        "Frank: Let me talk to your son, please. ",
        "Alan: Sure, frank. ",
        "Frank: I'm sorry. I was a louse tonight. I don't think it's any mystery that \r\nI'm not a fan of the spauldings. But when I was framed, I'm even more convinced \r\nthat the spauldings were behind this antimonious ring. Anyway, I just want you \r\nto know that you're a good man, and i know that. ",
        "Gus: Frank, I... ",
        "Frank: Please. Ever since harley broke up with phillip, I... I thought that \r\nshe would never be able to trust a man again, let alone get married, but you \r\nturned her around. You showed her hope. You showed her how to love again, how to \r\nbe honest, to open up. And I am very grateful for that. I really put my foot in \r\nit tonight, gus, and I just hope that tomorrow you let me stand up and be your \r\nbest man, because I would be honored. ",
        "Gus: It's all right, man. All right? ",
        "Frank: I'm sorry, man. ",
        "Darci: Honey? We really should get you home. ",
        "Gus: Yeah, get him into bed or something, would you, please? ",
        "Alan: Look, I know this is difficult for you. ",
        "Gus: (Laughs bitterly) yeah, right. You know what frank just said to me?\r\n",
        "Alan: What? ",
        "Gus: He told me that I taught harley how to love again, how to open up and \r\nhow to trust. I'm better than I thought. I'm good. I'm really good. I am. I'm \r\nlike the champion of liars. I'm a champ. ",
        "Alan: Let me tell you something. All this will soon be over. ",
        "Gus: Never. ",
        "Alan: You're going to be walking down the aisle with the woman you love...\r\n",
        "Gus: You're wrong. I am going to be walking down the aisle with this right \r\nnext to me, and it's going to get in between me and harley, and it is going to \r\nlive there for the rest of our natural lives. ",
        "Alexandra: I cannot give up buzz. ",
        "Harley: Oh, you will. He deserves better. ",
        "Alexandra: Very possibly so. ",
        "Harley: Good. Then we are in agreement. First thing, you will break it off \r\nwith my father. Because in my world, your lies are unforgivable. Don't push me \r\non this. ",
        "Alexandra: All right, harley. I'll... I'll end it. But you know something? In \r\nyour world, this world of yours, it isn't the real world, you know. Because in \r\nthe real world, the difference between lies and truth is... is very narrow, so \r\nnarrow and blurred that you can sometimes not even see it. ",
        "Harley: If you have something to say, just say it. ",
        "Alexandra: What I'm trying to say is don't look too closely at this case, \r\nbecause the more you dig, the deeper the hole for everyone. ",
        "Harley: Next, on \"guiding light\": ",
        "Cassie: You know, she should be afraid of me, because I'm not going to back \r\noff. I'm going to find this phony princess, and I don't care if i have to go to \r\nthe end of the earth to do it. ",
