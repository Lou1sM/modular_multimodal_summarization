        "Jonathan: Hey, Lizzie. ",
        "Lizzie: Hey, I was just going to leave you a\r\nnote. I'm going to go grab some food. Are you okay? ",
        "Jonathan: Huh? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Why? ",
        "Lizzie: You didn't come home last night and,\r\nno offense, you kind of look beat. ",
        "Alan: Yeah, probably out partying. ",
        "Jonathan: I stayed with Tammy last night.\r\nIt's really hard to sleep in those hospital chairs. ",
        "Lizzie: How is she? ",
        "Jonathan: She's good. She's good. Here. ",
        "Lizzie: Cheese fries and ranch dressing?\r\nThat was... that was what I was just going to go get. ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, Buzz gave me a hard time\r\nabout ordering it because it wasn't on the menu, but I told him it was one of\r\nyour pregnancy things. ",
        "Lizzie: How did you know that? ",
        "Jonathan: Tammy mentioned it the other day\r\nand Company was on my way home from the hospital, so... ",
        "Lizzie: Thank you. ",
        "Jonathan: Well, you got to eat more now\r\nbecause of the baby, so... ",
        "Lizzie: \"The\" baby? ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. ",
        "Lizzie: Last night, you know, you said\r\n\"My\" baby, so I was just... okay, what's the deal? Do you care about\r\nher now? You want to be a part of her life? ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Yeah, I do. ",
        "",
        "Josh: Hey, buddy. ",
        "R.J.: You didn't come to the pond, so we\r\nbrought the pond to you. ",
        "Cassie: I see, uh-huh. So how did the\r\nswimming go? ",
        "R.J.: Good. Uncle Josh says I'll blow the\r\nother guys out of the water at my swim meet. ",
        "Cassie: That's great, that's great. ",
        "Josh: (Laughs) He was great. You were\r\nfantastic, strong! ",
        "Cassie: You know, R.J., I think your Uncle Josh\r\ncould use a big thank-you hug. ",
        "Josh: I think that's a bad idea. Don't,\r\nuh-uh... oh, thank you so much. Thanks a lot, buddy, I appreciate that. Nice. \r\n",
        "R.J.: Thanks for taking me swimming, Uncle Josh.\r\n",
        "Josh: You are a rotten child, go away.\r\nGoodbye. Go. Go! ",
        "Cassie: Take this with you. ",
        "Josh: Thanks, that was... that was good. ",
        "Cassie: Feels good, doesn't it? ",
        "Josh: Yeah, yeah, it's terrific. ",
        "Cassie: Please, you're not even damp. So,\r\nthank you for spending time with R.J. I'm sure you can see he really enjoys\r\nit. ",
        "Josh: I enjoyed it, too. ",

        "Reva: You're doing it again. ",
        "Colin: Doing what? ",
        "Reva: That thing you do with your eyebrows. ",
        "Colin: What thing? ",
        "Reva: When you move your eyebrows up and\r\ndown. Like, \"Hmm, isn't this interesting.\" So, McCabe... how am I\r\ndoing? ",
        "Colin: Your blood count is up. So far, so\r\ngood. But, forget the numbers. How do you feel? ",
        "Reva: After hearing numbers like that, I'm\r\nfeeling pretty good. ",
        "Colin: No, be honest. ",
        "Reva: I feel like I could take on the world.\r\n",
        "Colin: Well, good. Then, you know, our work\r\nhere is done. ",
        "Reva: Until when? ",
        "Colin: No, that's it. ",
        "Reva: You mean I can just hop on out of this\r\nbed and walk out of here? ",
        "Colin: Yeah, something like that. ",
        "Reva: Colin! ",
        "Colin: Reva, I've done everything I can for\r\nyou. It's up to you now. ",
        "Reva: You're kicking me out? ",
        "Colin: Reva, let me put it this way. I've\r\ndone everything for you that is medically possible. Anything more would just be\r\ntorturing you for my own amusement. ",
        "Reva: Is this the reassuring version? ",
        "Colin: Why are you... what do you want me to\r\nsay? ",
        "Reva: I don't know, it just all sounds so\r\nfinal. ",
        "Colin: Reva, we're at a turning point. Okay?\r\nWe've wiped out and rebuilt your immune system, we've done the bone marrow\r\ntransplant, your white and red counts are up and as good as can be expected\r\nright now. It's up to you now. ",
        "Reva: No pressure. ",
        "Colin: Well, if beating cancer were as easy\r\nas willing it away, then there'd be only survivors. ",
        "Reva: And you'd be out of job. ",
        "Colin: Yeah, happily so. Look, there's no\r\nreason for you to stay here anymore. We've done everything to prepare your body\r\nto finish this fight. Now it's either going to beat the disease or it won\u2019t. \r\n",
        "Reva: All this time and your bedside manner\r\nstill sucks. ",
        "Colin: You're allowed to be angry. ",
        "Reva: I'm not angry, I'm... it's just a lot\r\nto take in, you know? I mean, I thought we were in this thing together. Doctor\r\nand patient, Bonnie and Clyde, Butch and Sundance. Now you're dumping me and\r\nit's just me and the cancer. ",
        "Billy: And me. ",

        "Cassie: You don't have to do that. ",
        "Josh: There's water on the floor, somebody\r\ncan slip. ",
        "Cassie: No, no, no, I mean you don't have to\r\ndo that. ",
        "Josh: There's a lot of water on the floor.\r\nWhat's the problem, Cassie? Come on, are we going to do this again? I'm happy\r\nto help you with things. ",
        "Cassie: Oh, cleaning my floor makes you\r\nhappy? ",
        "Josh: I do windows, too. ",
        "Cassie: Stop. ",
        "Josh: Come on, what's the issue here?\r\nReally. ",
        "Cassie: You camped out with me at the\r\nhospital, you stay over to make R.J. feel good, you're cleaning my floors, you\r\ntake him swimming, and that's all just the last couple days. ",
        "Josh: Okay, all right, all right, all right.\r\nYou got me. You got me. I've been sentenced to 500 hours of community service\r\nby-- ow! Look this is not generosity or anything like that. This is just I'm\r\nhere because I like to be here. Okay? I have a lot of things I could be doing\r\ntoday, but I'm where I want to be. ",
        "Cassie: Well, you could stay and scrub my\r\nbathtub, if you want, but I have to go drop R.J. off at practice and pick up Tammy\r\nat the hospital... ",
        "Josh: Okay, okay, okay. Look, this is good\r\nbecause I was thinking about stopping by Company to have a bite to eat so I\r\ncould give you a ride. ",
        "Cassie: I don't know... ",
        "Josh: Cassie, I spent the night here right\r\nthere on that couch with you sleeping upstairs, nothing happened. Right? It's\r\nokay. We're back to normal. Back to the way things were before... ",
        "Cassie: Before we were honest about what we\r\nwere feeling? ",
        "Josh: Yes. ",
        "Cassie: Okay, so we'll tough it out. ",
        "Josh: I wouldn't put it that way myself... ",

        "Lizzie: How...? Reva? ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. I just... I just realized\r\nit'll be okay. You know, me, a kid. Everything. ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, we can make it work. Tammy\r\nmust be so excited. This is exactly what she wanted. ",
        "Jonathan: Well, I haven't told her yet.\r\nShe's been asleep most of the time, so... ",
        "Lizzie: You've had a lot of time to think\r\nabout it? ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I guess. ",
        "Lizzie: Because I have been thinking, too. You and Tammy \r\nhave done so much for me and I've been trying to come up with some way to say \r\nthank you, but I wanted it to be big. Okay, so, should I wait until she's here \r\nor should I just tell you right now? Okay, I can't wait. I got the Outskirts bar \r\nback for you and I got Tammy back into Springfield U. (Laughs) ",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie, how did you do that? ",

        "Alan: What did you say? Wait, wait...\r\nvisiting? Was she here? ",

        "Jonathan: (Sighs) I really don't like\r\ngetting things that way. Tammy's not going to have to study at the Lizzie Spaulding\r\nlibrary now, is she? ",
        "Lizzie: (Laughs) No. All I could afford to\r\nget my name on was a freshman dorm. Just say thank you! Okay? Look, it feels\r\ngood for me to do something like this for you guys. ",

        "Jonathan: Well, don't you kind of have to\r\ngo? ",
        "Lizzie: It's just the orientation, and Tammy\r\nwas my birthing partner and she can't go, so... ",

        "Lizzie: Oh, I just said. It's at Cedars. ",
