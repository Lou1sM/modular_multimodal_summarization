        "Billy: Well, come on in here. Filters are all working. It's safe.",
        "Reva: I know.",
        "Billy: You know, but you're not coming in.",
        "Reva: I was just thinking about what Colin said, you know, about how I've exhausted all of my treatment options, and that I either get better or I don't.",
        "Billy: Darling, you're going to get better. Now, come on in and let's take a load off, okay?",
        "Reva: Right before I left the clinic, Colin tried to talk me into going home.",
        "Billy: Is that what you want to do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: No, I'll just take a look at the air conditioner while I'm here.",
        "Cassie: I don't need you to do that, Josh.",
        "Josh: Cassie, come on, are we going to do this again, really?",
        "Cassie: The repair man is on his way over, I've got all these fans...",
        "Josh: It's 98 degrees in this house!",
        "Cassie: This town really needs a new power grid.",
        "Josh: I was just thinking the same thing. Got a flashlight?",
        "Cassie: In the kitchen.",
        "Josh: Okay. Oops, I'm sorry. I apologize.",
        "Cassie: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's all right. Oh! Ah!",
        "Josh: You okay?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I just stubbed my toe.",
        "Josh: Okay, maybe you should go look and I'll just go here and not touch anything.",
        "Cassie: Where's that flashlight?",
        "Josh: Well, if you can't find the flashlight, maybe matches or something, you know? Some candles?",
        "Cassie: I can't find matches, I can't find anything. I can't see.",
        "Josh: Well, let me come over there and help you out then.",
        "Cassie: No, stay where you are.",
        "Josh: Okay, okay. Okay.",
        "Cassie: Can you believe this? Do you know how much money I spend on electric bills?",
        "Josh: Well, you know, it's summer and things like this happen.",
        "Cassie: Oh, do they? Do they just happen?",
        "Josh: What does that mean?",
        "Cassie: You and me. In a blackout. Again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: All right, Cassie, don't get mad at me, but I'm doing this for your own good. And Josh's. And mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: What is taking so long?",
        "Tammy: The nurse said she'll be back soon.",
        "Jonathan: Soon? That was like 20 minutes ago. I want to go see what's going on.",
        "Tammy: Relax. I'll get out of here when I get out of here.",
        "Jonathan: Don't you want to go home?",
        "Tammy: Of course, I do. At least we're alone now.",
        "Jonathan: Good point.",
        "Tammy: What are you doing?",
        "Jonathan: Being alone.",
        "Tammy: So, what was Reva's reaction when you told her you wanted to be part of your baby's life?",
        "Jonathan: What do you think?",
        "Tammy: Mmm... she cried.",
        "Jonathan: (Laughs)",
        "Tammy: (Chuckles) You're doing the right thing. She knows it, and I know it, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Granddad. Thought you were at home.",
        "Alan: Well, I was, and now I'm here.",
        "Lizzie: What's that?",
        "Alan: Your airline ticket to Italy.",
        "Lizzie: You're flying commercial.",
        "Alan: Yes, we're flying commercially because your Aunt Alex has the jet. Here, take it.",
        "Lizzie: I... I didn't say that I was going.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, this is your chance for a fresh start away from Jonathan. Now, he's only taking advantage of you and your baby. And we've gone over that before. His allegiances are to Tammy, and I think that is very clear.",
        "Lizzie: They've both been really good to me.",
        "Alan: It's because you pay their bills and you reinstated Tammy to school.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, they didn't ask me to do that.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, if you come with your mother and me, we will support you 100% with no strings attached. Now, the plane leaves in a few hours. You have a decision to make. You turn me down, and you and your baby will be on your own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: What do you say we forget about your walking papers and just take off?",
        "Tammy: What happened to being alone?",
        "Jonathan: These green walls are starting to make my head hurt. Plus, we can do a lot more at home.",
        "Tammy: With Lizzie in the next room?",
        "Jonathan: I can be quiet. I don't think you can, though. That would be the real challenge.",
        "Tammy: Oh, you never change.",
        "Jonathan: I changed when I hooked up with you.",
        "Tammy: A little.",
        "Jonathan: Well, that's a lot for me.",
        "Tammy: True. Just think of what it will be like when you're a full-fledged daddy.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, honey...",
        "Tammy: Oh, don't get freaked out on me.",
        "Jonathan: It's just that this daddy thing is something that's a lot easier to take in small doses, you know?",
        "Tammy: Okay, well, then let's just stick to the here and now. You know I was thinking, we should get a joint checking account with Lizzie.",
        "Jonathan: Why?",
        "Tammy: Cover all our expenses. We can just all share it equally, pay all the bills from it.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. If you think it's a good idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I can't come with you tonight, Granddad.",
        "Alan: Of course you can, Elizabeth. Now, it is time for you to make a decision to protect yourself and your baby from the likes of Jonathan Randall. Look, if you stay, you know it is going to cost you.",
        "Jonathan: What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Alan: None of your business.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, it's okay. We were just talking.",
        "Jonathan: No, it's not okay. I told you to stay away from Tammy and I meant it.",
        "Alan: Mm, quite the protector of young Tammy, aren't you?",
        "Jonathan: Get out of here or I'm going to throw you out.",
        "Alan: Spaulding Foundation is the largest benefactor to this hospital and I am on the board. It would not be wise of you to make a scene.",
        "Jonathan: You trying to scare me, big guy?",
        "Lizzie: Okay, could you guys just please both stop, for the baby's sake? Thank you.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Tammy and I are leaving-- if I can find a nurse-- so we'll be going soon, okay?",
        "Lizzie: Okay.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, there's something else that I need to talk to you about.",
        "Lizzie: What?",
        "Jonathan: Can we...",
        "Lizzie: I don't care if he hears. What is it?",
        "Jonathan: (Sighs) Tammy and I want to set up, like, a joint bank account for all of us, so we can work it out later.",
        "Lizzie: Wait. So you would have access to all of my money?",
        "Jonathan: That's the general idea, yeah.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, well, I don't like that idea.",
        "Jonathan: Why? What's wrong with it?",
        "Lizzie: Nothing. Except... I'm going to Italy with my mother and my granddad. And I'm going to have the baby there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Okay, here we go. A little tea. Just a touch of lemon and honey, the way you like it.",
        "Reva: Thank you.",
        "Billy: You all comfy? Want me to get your PJs?",
        "Reva: No, I think I'm just going to stay like this for a while.",
        "Billy: You're not having any second thoughts about this place, are you?",
        "Reva: Are you asking me if I want to go home? Of course I want to go home. I can't wait to be in Josh's arms again, but not like this. Not as some weak, pathetic, sick woman who can't even walk across a room without getting winded. I don't want him to see me that way.",
        "Billy: You know, you can be any way that you need to be right here with me.",
        "Reva: How am I ever going to thank you?",
        "Billy: You don't have to. Just get well. Then we'll take you home to Josh. Hey, I got a little soup in there. You hungry?",
        "Reva: I could eat a little something.",
        "Billy: Okay. I hear that the White Sox are playing the Twins. Check it out.",
        "Reva: Ah. Or maybe just a good, old- fashioned movie. Or maybe not. I want to go back to the clinic.",
        "Billy: Now?",
        "Reva: Yeah.",
        "Billy: Why?",
        "Reva: That little girl, Gretel, my roommate in the clean room. I didn't get to say good-bye to her.",
        "Billy: Well, it's kind of late. I'll take you over in the morning, okay?",
        "Reva: Well, it really can't wait. I told her that I'd let her read this book. I'd let her borrow it.",
        "Billy: Hey, what's really going on here?",
        "Reva: Why does anything have to be going on?",
        "Billy: Well, you're scrambling for a cover story...",
        "Reva: No, I'm not.",
        "Billy: This book is not something that a 12-year-old would read. Are you scared about coming here because...?",
        "Reva: Just take me back, please.",
        "Billy: Okay. Let me turn off the stove.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Okay, how's that? Is that better?",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Josh: Listen, if the lights don't come back on soon, you might want to think about you and R.J., you know, staying in town with me.",
        "Cassie: No, I don't think that'll be necessary.",
        "Josh: It's an incredibly hot summer night, Cassie. I mean, why be miserable?",
        "Cassie: Well, I'm miserable now, so what's a few more hours?",
        "Josh: Okay, are you miserable because I'm here?",
        "Cassie: No, I'm just... I'm hot and I'm cranky.",
        "Josh: And you're sure that's all?",
        "Cassie: I'm positive.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Cassie: You know, there are lights on down the road. Would you maybe just check the fuse box?",
        "Josh: Sure. No problem. Excuse me. Thank you.",
        "Cassie: Springfield Power and Light, please.",
        "Blake: If you want Josh, you should go for it.",
        "Cassie: This is Cassie Winslow at 752 route 62. I need you to turn my power back on, and I need you to do it now. (Sighs) Josh?",
        "Josh: Yeah?",
        "Cassie: The power company says the problem is on this end.",
        "Josh: Yeah, I kind of figured that. Can you hold that for me, please, right there?",
        "Cassie: Sure.",
        "Josh: Thank you.",
        "Cassie: So, do you think it's a fuse, or...",
        "Josh: Well, actually I'm not sure.",
        "Cassie: Well, what do you think it is?",
        "Josh: I think I'm not sure. And it would help me a lot if that weren't going out.",
        "Cassie: Well...",
        "Josh: Do you have more batteries back at the house?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, but not to fit this thing.",
        "Josh: Do you have another flashlight back at the house?",
        "Cassie: It's broken.",
        "Josh: It's broken? Yeah, you might want to take that as a cue to restock.",
        "Cassie: Okay, could you cut with the commentary and just fix the problem, please?",
        "Josh: You know what, Cassie? I'm not an electrician.",
        "Cassie: Ain't that the truth.",
        "Josh: Well, if I can't figure this out, if I can't fix it, than we'll get what's-his-name over here to fix it tomorrow, okay?",
        "Cassie: Okay, well, I would appreciate that, but what do you suggest I do tonight?",
        "Josh: Well, I don't know. I... like I said before, maybe you and R.J. will just have to stay in town, that's all.",
        "Cassie: No, Josh, I... oh, come on. Oh!",
        "Josh: Great. Terrific. Okay.",
        "Cassie: Well, can you see anything?",
        "Josh: What do you think?",
        "Cassie: Well, what about you? Don't you have a flashlight in your car, Mr. \"Take a cue and be stocked?\"",
        "Josh: I had a flashlight in my car, okay? When I got the car cleaned I... I don't know what happened to the flashlight. It's not there.",
        "Cassie: Wonderful, wonderful. So we are completely in the dark?",
        "Josh: In the dark, yes. Unless...",
        "Cassie: Unless, what?",
        "Josh: Well, I think it might be... I just have to be really careful here because... Whoa!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Going somewhere?",
        "Colin: Yeah, Springfield. A car is waiting to take me to the airport.",
        "Reva: Oh, but it's just a short trip, right? You'll be back?",
        "Colin: Actually, no. I have patients to attend to.",
        "Billy: Wait, wait a second. What is she, chopped... I mean, what, are you going to run out on her?",
        "Colin: I'm not running out on anyone, Mr. Lewis.",
        "Billy: It certainly looks like it to me.",
        "Reva: Billy...",
        "Billy: No, hey, come on. He started this thing. He should follow it through.",
        "Colin: I was going to call you in the morning.",
        "Billy: After you were gone?",
        "Colin: I explained to her... Reva, you know I've done what I can do for you; it's just a matter of monitoring you now.",
        "Reva: That's what you said.",
        "Colin: And I have other patients who need me, you understand?",
        "Reva: I do.",
        "Colin: And I'll still be monitoring your progress, and the staff here is top notch.",
        "Billy: I don't believe this. I think we should get another doctor, I mean, one who doesn't bail.",
        "Colin: Well, that's your prerogative. Of course, if you change your mind about going home...",
        "Billy: She's not ready to go home yet.",
        "Colin: Well, in that case I... I guess I'll say good-bye now.",
        "Reva: All right. Bye. I'll see you soon.",
        "Colin: Yeah. I hope so. More than you know. Okay, then. Mr. Lewis.",
        "Billy: Hey, you okay?",
        "Reva: Yeah, yeah. I just wasn't really expecting that.",
        "Billy: We're going to find another doctor tomorrow. Maybe we'll check out right away.",
        "Reva: No, it's fine. It really is. I just... can we just get back in there because I want to talk to Gretel before she goes to sleep for the night. (Gasps) No. No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, it's time for us to go.",
        "Jonathan: Wait, wait, wait, wait. You were going to pack up just like that?",
        "Lizzie: I've been thinking about it for a while.",
        "Jonathan: Since when?",
        "Lizzie: Since... does it really matter, Jonathan?",
        "Jonathan: Yes, it matters. I want to know what the hell is going on with you.",
        "Alan: Enough of you, all right? Stop.",
        "Jonathan: Stop it! What is he doing to you? Lizzie, you are scared of this guy. Now you're going to travel halfway around the world with him?",
        "Lizzie: It's for the best.",
        "Jonathan: Says who? Your grandfather? You're all set to live with me and Tammy, you don't even want to see your crazy family. Are you threatening her?",
        "Lizzie: It isn't like that.",
        "Jonathan: Well, I don't believe you.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth came to her own senses about you, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: What? So this is about me? What did he say? What did he say about me?",
        "Lizzie: He didn't have to say anything. Frankly, it's obvious.",
        "Jonathan: Obvious? What's obvious?",
        "Lizzie: That you're using me and using our baby.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, please tell me how.",
        "Lizzie: You want my money. And probably anything else he can get his hands on.",
        "Jonathan: What? Is this about the joint account? Because that was Tammy's idea. I couldn't even care less.",
        "Alan: Now you're blaming your sick girlfriend.",
        "Jonathan: Alan, shut up, I'm talking.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, look, it isn't about the account, it's about everything. Look, you and Tammy are... you're really close, and I am always going to be the outsider.",
        "Jonathan: What?",
        "Lizzie: It's true. Until you can figure out how to take the baby away from me for good.",
        "Jonathan: You think I want the baby for good? Wow. Wow. I just got used to having the thing at all. You know that.",
        "Lizzie: I know what you told me.",
        "Jonathan: But you believe him? You believe him? You know what he's doing, right? He's manipulating you and you are playing right into his hands. If anyone is going to take that baby away from you, it's going to be him.",
        "Alan: I'm family.",
        "Jonathan: So am I.",
        "Alan: Not anymore. Come on, Elizabeth.",
        "Jonathan: And you don't get to do this. This is my kid, too. Lizzie, get back here!",
        "Alan: Keep him here until we're gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Sweetie, are you sure that you're all right?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I'm fine, Mom.",
        "Alan: Of course she's fine. She was never in danger. I wouldn't allow it.",
        "Beth: I'm just surprised that you agreed to this.",
        "Lizzie: I know. I just realized that a lot of what you were saying is true. So, shouldn't we be getting to the airport?",
        "Alan: Well, sweetheart, we still have time.",
        "Lizzie: You are thinking of our corporate jet. You have to get there early these days to fly commercial.",
        "Beth: Mm-hmm. She's right, Alan. We have to check in, we have to go through security.",
        "Alan: Mm. We're already packed. It won't take long.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, I have to go pack my stuff.",
        "Alan: Oh, Elizabeth, I took the liberty of sending Hilda over to pack your things. Now, if there's something that she has forgotten, we will replace it in Rome.",
        "Beth: Honey, you want me to go with you?",
        "Lizzie: No, I can do it myself. Come here. I just wanted to say thank you, Granddad.",
        "Alan: You're welcome, sweetheart.",
        "Beth: How did you do it? How did you get her to agree?",
        "Alan: Let's just say I helped her see the light, huh?",
        "Beth: You never cease to amaze me.",
        "Alan: Well, you know I always take on the impossible, and win.",
        "Beth: Speaking of impossible, what about Jonathan?",
        "Alan: He's been detained.",
        "Beth: Detained? Oh, you're taking a chapter from my book.",
        "Alan: Which you plagiarized.",
        "Beth: (Chuckles)",
        "Alan: I'm glad you're back on my side, Beth.",
        "Beth: Now you still have a lot of work to do.",
        "Alan: I understand that, but we're making progress with Elizabeth. All we have to do is get her out of town before she changes her mind. Because once we get her to Italy, she will see things our way, I assure you. And also, the baby will have the best parents possible: Us.",

There's saran wrap, bathing with Robert Newman. In fact, I couldn't bathe by myself for at least two months after working with him because I just felt like I was naked. I was alone, I couldn't do it.

        "Jonathan: No, no. It's too late, you know? Too late. Lizzie made up her mind, whatever.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, well, Lizzie changes her mind every ten seconds.",
        "Jonathan: (Sighs in frustration)",
        "Tammy: Jonathan, Alan might never let you see that baby. Going after Lizzie right now might be your only chance.",
        "Jonathan: You know, this is why, this is why I did not want to do this. I only want to care about one thing, you know? You. You, I can count on. This? I knew this was going to happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Listen, I understand, Howard, but I want you to make sure that Jonathan Randall never leaves this country. Look, I don't care. If it does go to court, make sure it sticks, do you understand? Well, that's that.",
        "Beth: You think you can say something like that and then just let it go?",
        "Alan: Say something like what?",
        "Beth: You said that we'd be the parents to Lizzie's baby.",
        "Alan: Perhaps I overstated it.",
        "Beth: No, you didn't. You meant it.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth is too young and immature to raise a child. Plus, she's very fragile at this time.",
        "Beth: So what, we're just going to take the baby from her?",
        "Alan: No, no, no, no. Not at all. She will be a part of the process.",
        "Beth: A part of it.",
        "Alan: Beth, I don't think you realize how devastated I was when we lost our child. I will never forget the look in your face when you found out that we had lost that little baby. We didn't lose just a child; we lost an opportunity. An opportunity for me to redeem my past, to make up for the mistakes that I made with my other children.",
        "Beth: You think that Lizzie's baby can offer you that?",
        "Alan: No, no, I want it for you, too, Beth. For us.",
        "Lizzie: So, should we get going?",
        "Alan: Well, I'll have Jeremy bring our luggage down and we'll go.",
        "Lizzie: Your bags are already taken care of.",
        "Alan: Really? Well, ladies, shall we?",
        "Beth: Alan, I'd like a minute alone with Lizzie.",
        "Alan: Is there a problem?",
        "Beth: No, no. I'll meet you at the car.",
        "Alan: Okay, but don't be long.",
        "Lizzie: What is it, Mom?",
        "Beth: I just want to tell you how proud I am of you.",
        "Lizzie: What?",
        "Beth: Well, it's not easy to admit when someone has taken you in and not had your best interest at heart. You made the right decision. You're not going to regret this.",
        "Lizzie: Well, we shouldn't keep granddad waiting.",
        "Beth: Lizzie, he really loves you, you know. Every bit as much as your father did. And I love you so much, too. I love you, sweetie. You ready?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah.",
        "Beth: Okay. Let's go.",

        "Gretel: Reva?",
        "Reva: Gretel. Oh, honey! Oh, my old sweetheart. Ah, it's so good to see you. I thought that... oh. So you've been released.",
        "Gretel: My foster dad went to get the car.",
        "Reva: Well, that's good news.",
        "Gretel: Isn't it? I couldn't wait to get out of here, not that I didn't have the best roommate.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, you know, I wanted to get out of here, too.",
        "Gretel: We both got our wish.",
        "Reva: Yes, we did. So, this is great. I mean, what happens next with your treatment?",
        "Gretel: I don't know. We'll have to wait and see. It could be good. It's going to be good. I am not worried.",
        "Reva: Yes.",
        "Gretel: And best of all, I don't have to wear that hideous night gown anymore.",
        "Reva: (Laughs) It's not really glamorous, is it?",
        "Gretel: No. Want to know the first thing I'm going to do when I get out of here?",
        "Reva: What's that?",
        "Gretel: I'm going to buy a swimsuit. I love swimming. I know I won't be able to go this year, but I can wear it around the house. My friend, Casey, works at the best store in the mall. She'll hook me up with something really good.",
        "Reva: Sounds like you're very excited about seeing all your friends.",
        "Gretel: I don't have many. I've only lived here in Willmar six months, and most of the time I was in the hospital. But Casey's cool. She sent me a card every day I was here.",
        "Reva: That sounds like a great friend.",
        "Gretel: She is. I have a feeling we're going to be friends a long, long time.",
        "Reva: (Laughs) Just like you and me.",
        "Gretel: We're family, remember?",
        "Reva: Of course I remember.",
        "Gretel: I'm going to come visit you some day, you and Joshua.",
        "Reva: I like the way you say that. You can come any time you want, sweetie.",
        "Gretel: Let's make it about ten years. We'll both be around then.",
        "Reva: You are one brave kid.",
        "Gretel: I had a little help in that department.",
        "Reva: (Laughs)",
        "Gretel: Thanks, Reva. Thanks for everything. I'll pray for you.",
        "Reva: Come here, you. I'll pray for you, too.",
        "Billy: She seems like a nice kid.",
        "Reva: She's the best.",
        "Billy: Yeah.",
        "Reva: And now I know what I have to do.",

        "Cassie: You are not fine. Do I have to fight you on this?",
        "Josh: No, what are you going to do, like, bandage my entire hand, all of my fingers?",
        "Cassie: No, I was just going to bandage the ones that need it.",
        "Josh: Well, none of them actually need it because I didn't really feel much of anything, okay?",
        "Cassie: Liar.",
        "Josh: Excuse me, my mother taught me to never lie.",
        "Cassie: Well, then you should have listened to her.",

        "Josh: It's okay, it wasn't your fault.",
        "Cassie: Well, if I hadn't made such a big deal about the lights going out...",
        "Josh: No, Cassie, forget it, okay? I have.",

        "Josh: You're going to go for a swim now?",
        "Cassie: I need to cool off. So I'm going to go, and if you don't mind, if you would stay here in case R.J. comes home?",

        "Reva: And then I saw that little girl, you know? And she's got the right take on all of this. She wants to live her life. And I have to say to myself, \"Why isn't that me? What am I so afraid of?\"",
        "Billy: You're not afraid.",
        "Reva: Yeah? I'm not? I mean, hanging around here like it's the front parlor of a funeral home. I'm just waiting to die.",
        "Billy: Well, darling, now, are you sure you want to go... I mean, are you ready to tell everybody about what you've been going through that you worked so hard to keep this all a secret?",
        "Reva: I know, but that was when I had choices, some semblance of control. But I don't anymore. It's in God's hands now. Every minute I'm away from Josh was another minute I will never get back if I...",
        "Billy: Hey. You sure about this?",

        "Tammy: You took a big risk, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Someone had to get him out of the way. Okay, so let's just hope that he gets a little testy, because they hate that, and it's been a while, so I'm thinking that they're in really big trouble.",
