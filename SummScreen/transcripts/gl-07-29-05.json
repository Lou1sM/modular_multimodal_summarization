        "Sandy: What the hell is going on here?",
        "Tammy: Nothing.",
        "Sandy: You don't have to protect him, Tammy.",
        "Jonathan: Did you not hear her? Nothing happened.",
        "Sandy: Then why the hell are you here? Why can't you stay away from my girlfriend?",
        "Jonathan: You ever think maybe it's you I can't stay away from?",
        "Tammy: You guys, don't.",
        "Sandy: It's okay; you don't have to protect him.",
        "Jonathan: You're losing your famous cool, Sandman!",
        "Sandy: I just want to know how you managed it. What did you do, climb the balcony? Pretend to be room service?",
        "Tammy: No, Sandy. I let him in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Josh, how much do you know about Reva's relationship with this guy Nate, or Alfred, or whatever the hell his name is?",
        "Josh: She worked for him and they were friends until she found out who he really was. So, what's in the file, Frank?",
        "Frank: Well, I went down to the bar and I talked to some people, and they seem to feel it was a little bit more than that, that they were an item.",
        "Josh: Thank you.",
        "Frank: I'm sorry, Josh.",
        "Reva: Jonathan's not answering. What is it?",
        "Josh: I have to ask you something.",
        "Reva: What?",
        "Josh: I was afraid to ask you this before. I guess I was afraid of the answer. Did you sleep with Nate?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Well, the moussaka's almost done but where's the champagne?",
        "Coop: Got it right here on ice.",
        "Buzz: Oh, good. Well, all we need is Harley and Gus.",
        "Coop: And Frank and Marina.",
        "Buzz: Oh, no. Marina's stuck at the police academy. Frank's not here?",
        "Coop: No, he's not. No, not yet.",
        "Buzz: He'll be here or I'll kill him. It's his sister's engagement party.",
        "Coop: Yeah, well. Oh, Pops, by the way, thank you for letting me invite Lizzie tonight.",
        "Buzz: Well, you know me. I'm a sucker for redemption. And, you know, we can't keep her away, exactly, because it's her restaurant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: I want you to come back home.",
        "Lizzie: No.",
        "Beth: Not for good, just for the night. I called Carlene and she can squeeze us in for a couple massages. Hm?",
        "Lizzie: That's really sweet, Mom, but no.",
        "Beth: Okay. Well, don't make this your final answer. Just think about it.",
        "Lizzie: I don't need to think about it. I'm not going back to the house.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Honey, I know that you hate that place.",
        "Harley: I don't hate it. That much.",
        "Gus: All I'm saying is visit me. Okay? You visit me and I'll visit you, and it won't be for very long.",
        "Harley: Well, that's not really what I wanted to hear. I want to be where you are.",
        "Gus: Okay, but it's just for... I'll be up at the mansion, up on the hill, and you'll be over at the Bauer's, and I have to just kind of put my family back on track. You understand that, right?",
        "Harley: I understand why you're doing what you're doing. Hey, I am the last person in the world who wants a Spaulding coming between you and me again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Phillip, I have to leave Springfield to protect you. To protect both of us. Phillip. Phillip, where are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: You know that I would do anything for you. Anything. Except this one teeny-tiny little thing.",
        "Gus: Are you forgetting I did not ask you to come up and live at that house with me. Do you remember? It was kind of your idea. I wouldn't expect that from you.",
        "Harley: I'm selfish.",
        "Gus: Not at all. Baby, look, I'll take care of the Spaulding's because I feel like I... I mean, it's my last name after all. And you've gotten your plate full. You've got your father and Frank and the kids. I mean, come on.",
        "Harley: Well, when you put it that way, I obviously have the better end of the deal.",
        "Gus: No, we have a lot of stuff, both of us. A lot of stuff.",
        "Harley: We do. We do, you're right. We both have...",
        "Gus: A lot of stuff.",
        "Harley: A lot of stuff.",
        "Gus: Are you telling me honestly in one way or the other that you're mad at me for looking out for my family, trying to put them on the mend.",
        "Harley: No. That's not what I'm doing, really. This is who you are, you know? You don't let people down. Thank God you don't, because there wouldn't be an us, really. I just want you to promise me one little tiny thing while you're so busy doing this family stuff.",
        "Gus: Well, sure. Of course. Name it.",
        "Harley: This isn't going to interfere with you building our house, is it?",
        "Gus: No, no. I'm not one of those guys. No. Home store, late night, you and me. I promise.",
        "Harley: I can't wait.",
        "Gus: It's sexy.",
        "Harley: It'll be fun.",
        "Gus: So, will you promise me one little thing?",
        "Harley: Yeah, name it.",
        "Gus: Can you drop this Phillip thing?",
        "Harley: What Phillip thing?",
        "Frank: Hey, guys.",
        "Harley: Hey.",
        "Frank: I'm sorry I'm late.",
        "Gus: Hey, Frank. How are you? That's all right. You're late, we're late. We're the guests of honor, so it's...",
        "Frank: Let me see the rock.",
        "Harley: You already saw the rock.",
        "Frank: Come on, come on. Yep, there it is. ( Laughs ) No, really, I... I feel like this is something I should say at an engagement party.",
        "Gus: Oh, gee, Frank.",
        "Harley: You could try saying something like \"Congratulations, I'm so happy for you both.\"",
        "Gus: That would be nice.",
        "Frank: You know I am.",
        "Gus: Well, you see, we appreciate that. Thank you very much, Frank.",
        "Frank: Well, I hope this means that you'll be staying out of trouble from now on?",
        "Harley: Are you saying that I look for trouble? Me? Your sweet, innocent little sister? Just what are you saying to me, Frank?",
        "Frank: Well... ( laughter ) I think you just said it all, now, didn't you?",
        "Buzz: Hey, what are you guys doing out here? Come inside. Let's get the party started.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: So, everything is all set for you at the Bauer's, but are you all set for it?",
        "Lizzie: Yes. Yes, I am. I just have to pack a couple things from my closet. It won't take long. Not much.",
        "Coop: A couple things? Lizzie, I've seen your closet. It's bigger than most people's houses.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, well, I'm packing lightly, I promise.",
        "Coop: Okay. All right. Look, I've got to check on some food in the kitchen, but I could really use your help.",
        "Lizzie: My help?",
        "Coop: Yeah, your help.",
        "Lizzie: Well, okay. Absolutely. I'll do anything to help. ( Laughs )",
        "Beth: I couldn't help overhearing.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, you could. You could leave.",
        "Beth: Honey, I understand why you want to move in to the Bauers'.",
        "Lizzie: That's great. Then this conversation's over.",
        "Beth: Okay, maybe we could get... we'll get a place together.",
        "Lizzie: The Bauer's is where I belong.",
        "Beth: Where you belong?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. Coop knows it. Gus even sees it. I don't get why you don't.",
        "Beth: Gus is not your parent. I am, and I know what's best for you.",
        "Lizzie: Goodnight, mother.",
        "Coop: Okay, spill it. What's wrong?",
        "Lizzie: Nothing. Are you really sure about this whole move?",
        "Coop: Lizzie, I honestly think that you need to do what's best for you right now.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, great. Where have I heard that before?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Look, he didn't come here to cause trouble. Really.",
        "Sandy: Why are you still defending him?",
        "Tammy: I'm not. I just don't want there to be a misunderstanding.",
        "Sandy: Neither do I.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah.",
        "Sandy: No, no. You know what? You know what? You're going to stay and listen. You're going to listen to this.",
        "Jonathan: If you insist.",
        "Sandy: All right, I know how you operate. Okay? You live to disturb people's lives and you're not going to disturb ours anymore.",
        "Jonathan: Are you finished?",
        "Sandy: No. You know what? You've lost. She chose me. You can't always have everything you want.",
        "Tammy: You didn't have to do that.",
        "Sandy: Yes, I did.",
        "Tammy: I'm sorry.",
        "Sandy: It doesn't matter. He won't be a problem for us anymore. I made sure of that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: We've already been over this Nate stuff.",
        "Josh: It's a simple question, Reva. Did you sleep with him? Yes or no.",
        "Reva: I already told you.",
        "Josh: I know what you told me. Now I think you might have left something out.",
        "Reva: Are you accusing me of lying?",
        "Josh: I'm asking you a question.",
        "Reva: Well, that's not what it sounds like. What is that?",
        "Josh: Frank's file. Notes on Alfred Randall. And you.",
        "Reva: Notes? Well, what does it say?",
        "Josh: Well, apparently Frank talked to some of the regulars at Outskirts.",
        "Reva: About me?",
        "Josh: They saw you and Nate kissing, more than once. They saw you on top of him behind the bar?",
        "Reva: Oh, my God. ( Laughs ) A beer keg exploded. There was beer all over the floor. We slipped and fell.",
        "Josh: It's lucky you weren't killed, then.",
        "Reva: It's the truth.",
        "Josh: What about the kissing thing? Was that another exploding beverage incident?",
        "Reva: You want to joke about this?",
        "Josh: I'm not joking. I'm trying to help you dig yourself out of a very deep hole.",
        "Reva: Well, you know what? I don't care what any damn file says.",
        "Josh: So you're denying it.",
        "Reva: No. Those things happened. But I did not sleep with Nate.",
        "Josh: Well, Frank also said that someone thought you were an item.",
        "Reva: Well, \"Someone\" was wrong.",
        "Josh: Nothing else happened, then, that would make somebody believe that?",
        "Reva: I already admitted to you that there were these feelings and that I enjoyed the attention and we flirted, but that's where it stopped.",
        "Josh: And that's it? That's all of it?",
        "Reva: I didn't sleep with him. But I think I could have. And then I found out he was Alfred.",
        "Josh: So that was the only thing that stopped you? That's good to know.",
        "Reva: I never betrayed you. I wouldn't.",
        "Josh: And yet you almost threw it all away-- everything. Threw me away.",
        "Reva: It wasn't about you.",
        "Josh: It rarely is.",
        "Reva: You know that isn't true.",
        "Josh: Reva, what I know is that you can be very selfish sometimes. I'm sure that right now you've convinced yourself that this was some kind of an aberrance, a momentary weakness brought on by hormonal changes or a mid-life crisis, something like that. Am I close? Help me out, here.",
        "Reva: I don't know.",
        "Josh: Yeah, I don't know either. That's the deal. But I do know that I don't matter. I was buying TV stations and looking at property in Aspen, trying to do anything that I could to make things better for you. But you obviously couldn't have cared less.",
        "Reva: Well, what do you want me to say?",
        "Josh: Nothing. I just want you to understand that I'm getting real tired of not being enough for you.",
        "Reva: You are enough for me.",
        "Josh: I don't think so.",
        "Reva: I love you so much.",
        "Josh: But that didn't stop you, Reva, from coming that close to going into the arms of some other guy.",
        "Reva: But I didn't. Joshua...",
        "Josh: You know what? I can't be here right now. In fact, I don't think I want to stay here tonight. Excuse me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: What exactly did you do?",
        "Sandy: I called the cops, turned Jonathan in.",
        "Tammy: For taking the money from Lewis?",
        "Sandy: He stole it.",
        "Tammy: I can't believe you did that.",
        "Sandy: Why not?",
        "Tammy: It's not your place.",
        "Sandy: That's where you're wrong. I'm the only one who could do it.",
        "Tammy: What?",
        "Sandy: Well, Reva couldn't do it. It would be like she was abandoning him all over again, and Josh, well, he'd never hurt Reva like that.",
        "Tammy: He was going to give it back.",
        "Sandy: I don't believe that. Can you honestly say that you do?",
        "Tammy: I don't want to talk about this.",
        "Sandy: Okay, why don't we talk about why you let Jonathan in. Or why you keep letting him back into your life. He hurts everything he touches, including you.",
        "Tammy: I'm not letting him get to me anymore. I promised you that I wouldn't.",
        "Sandy: Oh, doesn't matter. He would have never left you alone and now he doesn't have a choice.",
        "Tammy: I guess not.",
        "Sandy: Hey, I did this for you. Jonathan will be arrested and you'll never have to worry about him again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: Hello, son. I've been looking for you.",
        "Jonathan: Well, you found me.",
        "Nate: Where's the money?",
        "Jonathan: Not in your account.",
        "Nate: Yeah, I know that, punk. Why haven't you transferred it yet?",
        "Jonathan: I changed my mind.",
        "Nate: You changed your mind?",
        "Jonathan: You can do whatever you want to me. You're not getting that money.",
        "Nate: What?",
        "Jonathan: I'm giving it back.",
        "Nate: What's the deal? Did mommy say she'd make everything better if you were a good boy?",
        "Jonathan: Reva's a good person.",
        "Nate: Jon, look, what will happen to you when she gets the money back? You go to jail.",
        "Jonathan: Maybe. You'll come with me. I know what you did to Marissa, remember?",
        "Nate: All right, kiddo, look. It doesn't have to be this way. There's another choice, for both of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Love each other, respect each other, and for heaven's sakes, stay under the radar for a while. ( Laughter )",
        "Harley: Here, here.",
        "Everybody: Here, here. ( Glasses clinking )",
        "Lizzie: You know... excuse me. I just want to congratulate you guys. It's really great you had a second chance.",
        "Gus: Thanks.",
        "Harley: Thank you.",
        "Lizzie: You're very welcome. And as owner of Company, your meal today is on me.",
        "Gus: That a boy.",
        "Harley: Come here. I want to talk to you for a second.",
        "Lizzie: Okay.",
        "Harley: Um, I'm really glad that you're here.",
        "Lizzie: Really? I was afraid it was going to be awkward and...",
        "Harley: No, no. You have been really decent to me lately. I mean, you could have turned me in; you didn't do that. And there was a time, Lizzie, when we were friends. When you were a little girl, we were... what I'm saying to you is, I want us to be friends again.",
        "Lizzie: I would... I would really love that. ( Laughter )",
        "Harley: Well, good. Good, good, good. So, what's going on with you and Coop? Tell me everything. ( Laughter )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Mallet came by earlier.",
        "Gus: Really?",
        "Buzz: Yeah. We had a little chat about the Phillip business. I think I made it clear I wanted him to stop encouraging Harley.",
        "Gus: Hm. I think she's already dropped that.",
        "Buzz: Do you believe that?",
        "Gus: Well, I don't really have a reason not to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Alan?",
        "Alan: Beth. Oh, thank you so much for coming.",
        "Beth: I almost didn't. I didn't know if I could face you.",
        "Alan: I don't blame you, after everything that's happened.",
        "Beth: I don't even understand what happened. First Phillip, your own son, and then you let Gus tear Lizzie apart on the witness stand? Nice work protecting your family.",
        "Alan: It was very painful for me to watch, as well, but I did it for the greater good.",
        "Beth: The greater good? Alan, you murdered your son. You made Lizzie relive one of the most horrific nights of her life.",
        "Alan: I did it because I knew that one day I would bring her father back to her completely well, Beth.",
        "Beth: Oh, Alan. ( Gasps )",
        "Alan: Why do I get the feeling you don't believe me?",
        "Beth: Why are you saying these things?",
        "Alan: Because he is out there, and I'm worried about him, and that is why I asked you here.",
        "Beth: No. You're not going to do this to me. I won't help you.",
        "Alan: Yes, you will, Beth. Because I want you to be bait. I want you to lure Phillip out of hiding.",
        "Beth: You know, you have done a lot of...",
        "Alan: Beth, Phillip is alive. Now, why would I make something up like that?",
        "Beth: So what do you want me to do?",
        "Alan: I want you to take out ads in magazines, the newspaper. I want you to go on television. I want you to lure him out. He will never resist you. You are the love of his life.",
        "Beth: Phillip is dead, Alan. It took me a long time to accept that and you have to accept it, too.",
        "Alan: I don't accept it because I know it's not true.",
        "Beth: For Lizzie's sake, for James, let their father rest in peace. Let them get on with their lives.",
        "Alan: Look, I know Elizabeth is very angry with her grandfather right now, but she will get over it in time.",
        "Beth: It's more than that. She could spin out of control.",
        "Alan: What do you mean? Has something happened?",
        "Beth: Just forget it. I shouldn't have said anything.",
        "Alan: No, no, no. Wait a minute. I am her grandfather, I should know what's going on.",
        "Beth: Nothing has happened yet, but she's going to move in to the Bauer's garage apartment.",
        "Alan: The Coopers are there.",
        "Beth: Exactly. And it's not that I have anything against them, but Lizzie is not ready for a relationship with Coop.",
        "Alan: Of course she's not and she never will be. That boy is not good enough for her.",
        "Beth: It's not about that. The point is that Lizzie will get hurt and she's not stable. I'm scared for her and I don't know what to do if she won't listen to me.",
        "Alan: I've got an idea. You won't help me with Phillip, Beth, but I will help you with your child.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Oh, my gosh. These are all the kids' drawings.",
        "Coop: Yeah. It was everything that they had done since... well, since you've been away. I figured that you would want them.",
        "Harley: Thank you. This is obviously Frank in the tree house.",
        "Frank: That's not me in the tree house.",
        "Harley: Come on, look at the size of that nose. That's got to be you.",
        "Buzz: Here.",
        "Harley: Oh, Daddy, what is this?",
        "Buzz: Open it.",
        "Harley: A doorbell?",
        "Buzz: It's for your house. You know... sorry I didn't wrap it.",
        "Gus: It's not a fancy one is it? Like... ( Mimics Westminster chimes ) Nothing like that, is it?",
        "Buzz: No, I thought for you, a simple ding-dong.",
        "Gus: Ding-dong. I like those.",
        "Harley: You don't want a fancy one, do you?",
        "Frank: That's a good gift, Pop. That's a nice gift. Hey, Sis, can I talk to you for a second?",
        "Harley: Yeah. Put the doorbell together, please. What?",
        "Frank: Are you sure this is what you really want?",
        "Harley: Another beer? Absolutely.",
        "Frank: I'm not talking about the beer.",
        "Harley: You're not still on the anti-Gus kick are you?",
        "Frank: Hold on a second. Are you sure you want to marry Gus?",
        "Harley: Why are you asking me this?",
        "Frank: I just want to make sure that you're happy.",
        "Harley: I'm happy, Frank.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: It's not too late for us. I still love you.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, yeah? Is that why you threw me in the water?",
        "Nate: You had to be taught a lesson.",
        "Jonathan: I can't swim.",
        "Nate: Oh, what are you crying about? Your little girlfriend saved you.",
        "Jonathan: How do you know that?",
        "Nate: I saw it all.",
        "Jonathan: What?",

I'm calling from the Springfield Police Department. Yes, Hi. We've... we have someone in custody right now, someone who charged a boat rental on their credit card to your web site. Do you need a confirmation number? It's Randall. Alfred N. Randall. R-a-n-d-a-l-l. Yes, well... what I'm really wondering is if the date on this receipt could be wrong. Well, it's because we're looking into an incident that happened here that... what? He has a boat reserved for next week? No. No, no. Thank you. You've given me all the information I need. Thank you.

I'm sure all of you know my dad gave me this restaurant to punish all of you and I think it worked pretty well, but you guys resisted me. You resisted everything: The pink menus, the veggie dogs, even the time clock in the back. And I know it wasn't easy.",
        "Frank: You can say that again.",
        "Lizzie: You know, sometimes I wish my dad had just given me flowers. And that's something he used to do. He used to give me pink tulips every week. It was just a tradition that he did. But then I realized I wouldn't have learned anything from flowers, not like I learned from being here at this place. Company. That's right. You guys taught me something, too. And the dad that I knew and I loved, he would have wanted me to take those things I learned and to run with them. And as you know, he means the world to me and I'm going to miss him every day. But he wouldn't have wanted me to be unhappy, he wouldn't have wanted me to hold grudges or to be a you-know-what on wheels. I think this is what he would have wanted, for me to quit all the arguing and just for all of us to get along, and I know in order for that to happen, it's going to be tough for me, but I'm going to try my hardest to do that. I wanted to give you this.",
