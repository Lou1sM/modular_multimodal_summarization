        "Ross: Marriage is not a union to be entered into lightly. ",
        "Harley: I love you. ",
        "Gus: I love you, too. ",
        "Ross: Harley cooper, do you take this man to be your lawful wedded husband, \r\nforsaking all others and remaining true to him, for as long as you both shall \r\nlive? ",
        "Harley: I do. ",
        "Ross: Gus aitoro, do you take this woman as your lawful wedded wife? And do \r\nyou promise to lie, deceive, dishonor and betray her, forsaking nothing except \r\nyour own idea of what is right, which in the eyes of god and most of mankind, \r\nhas been deemed to be completely insane? And do you also promise to be unworthy \r\nof this woman's love for as long as you both shall live? ",
        "Phillip: Uh, this is where you promise to ruin the bride's life. ",
        "Harley: Hurry up, gus. Break my heart. ",
        "Lizzie: (Humming the bridal march) ",
        "Alexandra: (Joins in) (laughter) ",
        "Buzz: Frank, what's the rush? ",
        "Frank: I need your help. ",
        "Buzz: Fine, but, you know, we could have done this, like at the bathroom or, \r\nlike, in the corner or someplace. ",
        "Frank: You may not want to give it to me. ",
        "Buzz: You know me better than that. Calm down. Tell me what's wrong. ",
        "Frank: Dad, this is bad. This is really bad, and it's going to hurt. ",
        "Buzz: Harley. ",
        "Frank: And you. ",
        "Buzz: Alex? ",
        "Frank: Dad, this is worse than anyone could have possibly imagined, and it \r\ncould definitely destroy this wedding. ",
        "Ross: And so they have pledged their promises and they have symbolically \r\ndeclared the same by giving and receiving the ring, and by the joining of their \r\nhands. Therefore, by the power invested in me by the city of springfield, I now \r\npronounce you... ",
        "Gus: Excuse me. May I just say something? First of all, this ring looks just \r\nso beautiful on you. ",
        "Harley: Thank you. ",
        "Gus: Now, I know what's going to happen after this ceremony. I know what must \r\nbe done with alexandra. You were hiding the truth to protect me, to keep me away \r\nfrom the family that I just became a part of. ",
        "Harley: I'm so sorry. ",
        "Gus: No. No, don't be. You're my family, not them. You're my future. I'm \r\ngoing to love you forever. ",
        "Ross: Well, now I pronounce you husband and wife. (Applause) ",
        "Harley: It could happen that way. It could happen just that way. ",
        "Gus: So, it's you. You're the pipeline of antimonious to the mob, huh? ",
        "Alexandra: Gus, you don't know what you're talking about. ",
        "Gus: I'd love to see you try and explain this to alan. ",
        "Alexandra: Oh. Alan can't know. No, you can't tell anyone, gus. ",
        "Gus: Oh, no? What, is this supposed to be our dirty little secret? ",
        "Alexandra: Come on, you and i can talk. Please don't do anything that we will \r\nboth regret. ",
        "Gus: I'm not going to regret anything. I'm just going to give you to the da \r\nand he's going to prosecute you for drug trafficking. I know what I saw. ",
        "Buzz: Turn it off. ",
        "Alexandra: But you don't have a shred of proof. ",
        "Buzz: Turn it off, frank! ",
        "Frank: I'm sorry, dad. ",
        "Buzz: My god! I don't know. You showed it to me. What... now what? ",
        "Frank: Dad, harley is... she's getting ready to walk down that aisle. This is \r\ngoing to destroy her. ",
        "Buzz: I know the feeling. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, I don't know what to do. I really want to make that family \r\npay, but I'm telling you, I don't know what to do here. (Indistinct \r\nconversation) ",
        "Dinah: Hi. The red two-door, please. ",
        "Bill: Dinah. ",
        "Dinah: Bill. ",
        "Bill: What are you... (laughs) I thought that was you. I mean, the hat and \r\nthe hair, i couldn't really tell, but... what are you doing here? ",
        "Dinah: I had to come back. ",
        "Bill: Well, no... ",
        "Dinah: You look great! ",
        "Bill: No, I mean it. What are you doing here? You're here in public, and of \r\nall places here in springfield. What... ",
        "Dinah: I know, I know. I know the risks of being here. ",
        "Bill: What, and you don't care? ",
        "Dinah: Hey, who's the older one here? ",
        "Bill: I'm worried about you. What's going on? ",
        "Dinah: I... I got tired of running, that's all. I came back to turn myself \r\nin. I can't even begin to explain to you what's been going on. ",
        "Bill: Are you kidding me? Wait, what... are you telling me you're going to \r\nface the charge? ",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Yeah, you're darned right I am. I want my life back, the one i \r\ndeserve. ",
        "Cassie: Looks like everyone's here. ",
        "Blake: Yeah, well, the usual suspects, at least. ",
        "Marina: Is edmund here? ",
        "Cassie: No, but he'll be here soon. ",
        "Blake: What about darci? Shouldn't she be here? ",
        "Marina: No. My dad's not back from the hotel yet to pick up the champagne. \r\nThey probably ran into each other. ",
        "Blake: Well, that or she's with harley. Maybe we should be with harley, don't \r\nyou think? Let's go. ",
        "Cassie: Hey. She said she wanted to be alone before the ceremony. Remember?\r\n",
        "Blake: She's had enough alone time, all right? She just doesn't want anybody \r\nto see her cry. ",
        "Cassie: I can keep the crying secret. I'll go check on her. You guys stay \r\nhere. ",
        "Blake: You tell her that there's no shame in crying on her wedding day, even \r\nif you are harley cooper. Your soul mate only comes around every once in a \r\nwhile. ",
        "Cassie: (Laughs) okay. ",
        "Michelle: All right, you have one mission today. One. Just keep people from \r\nhounding me about our wedding from last year. ",
        "Danny: What makes you think you'd be hounded? ",
        "Michelle: Um, we were practically attacked in the driveway. \"Oh, michelle, \r\nlast year it was you two. You were such a beautiful bride.\" I mean, aren't \r\npeople supposed to say \"hello\" before they launch into something like that? ",
        "Danny: Michelle, those women know you from the hospital. They're just trying \r\nto make conversation. ",
        "Michelle: Yeah, I'm just telling you... ",
        "Danny: Yeah, I get it. I get it, okay? You don't have to hit me over the head \r\nwith it. (Sighs) listen, I appreciate you coming with me today. I know that \r\nyou're still upset about what happened last night with felicia. ",
        "Michelle: Yeah. You got any more shrinks lined up for me today? ",
        "Danny: Only five or six. ",
        "Michelle: Look, I'm here to see a wedding. I'm not here to relive ours. And I \r\ncouldn't, even if I wanted to. ",
        "Reva: Hey, guys. How are you? ",
        "Danny: Hi. ",
        "Josh: Hello. ",
        "Danny: Good. ",
        "Josh: Hi, danny. ",
        "Reva: You know what this day reminds me of? ",
        "Michelle: I've got to get a drink. ",
        "Reva: Did I say something? ",
        "Danny: She thought that you were going to say something about our wedding \r\nlast year. ",
        "Reva: Actually, I was going to say the day reminds me of a movie I just saw. \r\n(Laughs) ",
        "Lizzie: Grandpa, joey's here. Doesn't he look great? ",
        "Alan: Who taught him to tie a tie? ",
        "Lizzie: Well, it's not exactly a windsor knot, but he's learning. ",
        "Alan: Well, if you're his teacher, he'll learn just fine. Now, let me tell \r\nyou something. If you're interested in this young man, perhaps we should have \r\nhim over for dinner one evening so I can find out what joseph's future goals \r\nare. ",
        "Lizzie: Oh, he likes to be called joey. ",
        "Alan: I'm sure he does. But now, if this young man is a project of yours, \r\nperhaps you could talk to him about changing his name? ",
        "Sheryl: I was about to give up on you today. ",
        "Tony: Yeah? ",
        "Sheryl: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Tony: Well, I was free, and i was hoping you were free. ",
        "Sheryl: Well, now, lucky for you, I was free today. ",
        "Tony: Oh, I'm the lucky one? ",
        "Sheryl: Yeah. ",
        "Tony: Yeah? ",
        "Sheryl: We'll see about that. ",
        "Tony: Yeah, I bet we will. (Cell phone ringing) ",
        "Tony: (Groans) go figure. ",
        "Sheryl: Is it important? ",
        "Tony: Nope. ",
        "This is tony. ",
        "Leave a message. (Voice mail beeps) ",
        "Michelle: Look, you told me to stay away from you, but i can'T. I need you \r\nhere. ",
        "Buzz: You found this at the beacon? ",
        "Frank: I certainly didn't go looking for it, that's for sure. I went to the \r\nbeacon to get some champagne. While I was down in the wine cellar, I noticed a \r\nsecurity camera. And I got to thinking that... look, dad, we need to tell harley \r\nthe truth about gus. ",
        "Buzz: I never asked you to lie, frank. ",
        "Frank: You're not saying much about anything right now. You know what this \r\nmeans? This tape confirms that the spauldings were behind my phony charges-- the \r\nones that were against me. This also confirms that alex was involved with the \r\ndrug ring. This also said that gus was covering up this entire time. ",
        "Buzz: Why did you bring this to me, frank? ",
        "Frank: I know this hurts you, and I'm sorry for that. I know you always \r\nwanted to believe the good about alex. ",
        "Buzz: I knew she wasn't perfect but... drugs?! Setting you up? That's not \r\nalex. That'S... she never gave me any reason. You told me. You told me again and \r\nagain. I didn't listen. ",
        "Frank: We need to tell harley the truth about gus. ",
        "Buzz: There's less than an hour until the wedding. ",
        "Frank: A wedding in where she's marrying a guy that's been lying to her all \r\nalong, a guy that's involved in a major conspiracy, a guy that she could \r\npossibly be spending the rest of her life with. ",
        "Buzz: Maybe she already knows about this. ",
        "Frank: Are you kidding me? She would never excuse drug traffickers, let alone \r\nlet me hang for something I never did. ",
        "Buzz: Are you ready to do this, frank? Blow up your sister's life on her \r\nwedding day? ",
        "Frank: No. ",
        "Harley: This day is going to be perfect. (Knock at door) gus, if that is \r\nyou, you'd better not come in here. ",
        "Cassie: Oh, look at you! You're a vision. ",
        "Harley: Is it time? ",
        "Cassie: No, not quite. Oh, harley. You look amazing. And happy. ",
        "Harley: I guess I must be happy, then. ",
        "Cassie: How about that? (Laughs) I'm proud of you. ",
        "Harley: Okay, don't make me cry. ",
        "Cassie: Okay, I won'T. But can I tell you that I just love you and I wish you \r\nthe best? ",
        "Harley: Okay. Just don't look into my eyes when you say it. (Laughter) ",
        "Cassie: Can I get you anything? ",
        "Harley: Gus is here, right? ",
        "Cassie: Harley. ",
        "Harley: I know it's a superstition, but if I don't see him before the \r\nwedding, then i will have bad luck. ",
        "Cassie: Well, you're going to see him really soon. ",
        "Harley: No. See, something happened last night, and I need to make sure he's \r\nokay and I need him to know that I love him. So, if I could just say that... ",
        "Cassie: Go. Go. ",
        "Harley: Really? ",
        "Cassie: Yes. ",
        "Harley: Thank you. ",
        "Phillip: Hey. ",
        "Gus: Hey. ",
        "Phillip: Okay, you're still jumpy. That's good. A man should be nervous on \r\nhis wedding day. ",
        "Gus: Yeah? That's good, then. That's what I am. ",
        "Phillip: It occurs to me, as one of your groomsmen, I think I'm supposed to \r\ngive you some sage advice. A little pithy wisdom that you can rely on throughout \r\nthe rest of your married life. ",
        "Gus: Okay. What have you got? ",
        "Phillip: Don't blow it. ",
        "Bill: Have you seen mom or ross or...? ",
        "Dinah: Yeah. He's the only one that knows, and now you, so I figure my father \r\nand my brother, if you're on my side, what could go wrong, right? ",
        "Bill: Well, maybe make it impossible. I mean, ross is the new mayor. I mean, \r\nif he doesn't turn you in. ",
        "Dinah: You know what? I'm going to save him the trouble, at least for now, \r\nokay? I need... I need to be back in springfield. I need to feel it. I have \r\nmissed this place so much, and I've missed you, lb. ",
        "Bill: \"Lb\"? Oh, my goodness. Come here. \"Little bill.\" No one's called me \r\nthat in a very, very long time. So, I mean, where are you going to stay? ",
        "Dinah: Well, I don't know. I haven't figured that out yet. ",
        "Bill: Well, here. Stay with me. I'm over at the old grain exchange building, \r\non the top floor. Just stay with me. ",
        "Dinah: Okay. And stay out of sight, right? ",
        "Bill: Yeah. Stay away from places like this, okay? ",
        "Dinah: Why? What's up with places like this? ",
        "Bill: This hotel? This is cassie's place. She owns it. ",
        "Dinah: Cassie layne? ",
        "Bill: Well, it's winslow now, but yeah. ",
        "Dinah: Oh. Well, I didn't know that she owned a hotel. I just wandered over \r\nhere from the park, you know? I was just cruising. ",
        "Bill: All right. Well, come on. Let's get you going, because, in fact, I'm \r\nrunning late. ",
        "Dinah: Where are you going? ",
        "Bill: I've got a wedding to go to. ",
        "Dinah: Who's getting married? ",
        "Bill: Harley cooper. ",
        "Dinah: Harley? ",
        "Bill: Harley cooper. ",
        "Dinah: Wow, okay. We had some times. ",
        "Bill: Yeah, yeah. And the groom is gus aitoro. He's a cop. In fact, a newly \r\ndiscovered son of alan spaulding. ",
        "Dinah: Well, okay. Harley ending up with another spaulding, that doesn't \r\nsurprise me. I imagine the whole town is going to be there, right? ",
        "Bill: Just about, just about. Yes. And cassie, as well. It's over at the \r\nspaulding estate, so you might want to keep away from that place, too. Okay? ",
        "Dinah: Okay. Well, you better get going. ",
        "Bill: All right, all right. But I'm going to see you later, right? ",
        "Dinah: Yeah, you can bet on it. Okay, go. Get out of here. ",
        "Bill: All right. ",
        "Dinah: (Whistles the ",
        "wedding march) ",
        "Phillip: Look, I'm not suggesting that I think you will blow it with harley.\r\n",
        "Gus: Right. You're just warning me in case. ",
        "Phillip: I hurt her very badly, gus. I really don't want to see anything like \r\nthat happen to her again. ",
        "Gus: Well, me, either. ",
        "Phillip: When our marriage ended, I don't think anybody would have blamed \r\nharley if she stayed closed off for the rest of her life. But she didn't, and \r\nthat's because of you. You found a way to break through to her. ",
        "Gus: Yeah. Okay. Well, thanks for the talk, you know? Thanks. ",
        "Phillip: Listen, I'm trying to tell you something. She thinks that you are \r\nthe greatest guy that she has ever known. She has seen things in you from the \r\nbeginning that I, for one, took a long time to acknowledge. ",
        "Gus: (Laughs) all right, well, if this is an apology, you know, we're cool, \r\nme and you. ",
        "Phillip: It's not an apology. It's a warning. There was a time when I was \r\nwith harley that I had an opportunity to be up front with her about the thing \r\nthat eventually tore us apart. ",
        "Gus: Yeah, beth. ",
        "Phillip: Right, beth. I did what I thought was best at the time. I lied. ",
        "Gus: Okay. But you know this is old news, right, phil? ",
        "Phillip: So learn from it. Don't hurt her. When something comes up-- and it \r\nalways does-- face it. Deal with it with her, together. She needs that. And she \r\ndeserves it. You both do. End of speech. Okay, now you can go. Go pace. Have a \r\ndrink. Bite your nails. It's almost time. ",
        "Olivia: I saw you talking with gus. How's he holding up? ",
        "Phillip: Good. Just gave him a little last- minute advice. (Sighs) secrets \r\nto a successful marriage. ",
        "Olivia: Well, may gus and harley ignore your advice for the rest of their \r\nlives. ",
        "Alan: Gus? Gus, gus? ",
        "Gus: Not now, okay? Please. ",
        "Alan: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Where are you off to, son? ",
        "Gus: You know, it's funny. People probably think that phillip and I are very \r\ndifferent, you know? He's the bad, evil son, and I'm the good son. Right? ",
        "Alan: Wait, wait. What are you talking about? ",
        "Gus: The truth... the truth of the matter is, I live off being superior. I \r\nalways have. I really loved my other father. I really... I really did. I loved \r\njoe august because with him, you did right by people. You lived a good, clean, \r\nhonest life. You served. You were better than other people. You were better than \r\nthese other people that screw up their lives. ",
        "Alan: That's who you are. You serve, you're an honest person. ",
        "Gus: But we both know that's not really true. ",
        "Alan: No, that's where you're wrong. ",
        "Gus: No. ",
        "Alan: Because you have done the right thing for your family and for harley?\r\n",
        "Gus: By my new bride-to-be? No, look, it's dawned on me. You can't just pick \r\nand choose in this life. You either live right or you live wrong, it's that \r\nsimple. I have to go and talk to harley, okay? ",
        "Alan: No, no. No. Not before the ceremony, gus. ",
        "Gus: The ceremony. The ceremony, that's the word. See, marriage, it's a \r\ntrust. So you can't just say \"I do,\" and then turn around and say, \"oh, by the \r\nway, this is what i did.\" ",
        "Alan: You're about to tell harley the truth, aren't you? ",
        "Harley: (Scoffs) gus, where are you? ",
        "Frank: Maybe you're right, dad. Maybe you're right. Maybe we should just sit \r\non this tape and let harley marry gus. ",
        "Buzz: It's an impossible choice, frank. We let her marry a liar, a criminal. \r\nI mean, how could... you don't destroy someone's life for the sake of being \r\nvindicated. You know? ",
        "Frank: That's not what this is about, and you know it. ",
        "Buzz: I don't know anything anymore! ",
        "Frank: It's bad enough that i did this to you, pop, all right? I know how you \r\nfelt about alex. ",
        "Buzz: I can't help thinking we missed something. ",
        "Frank: What, on the tape? ",
        "Buzz: No, something... something that would explain it all, something to make \r\nit make sense, something that... ",
        "Frank: What are you doing? ",
        "Buzz: I want to see if there's a reason that she did what she did, that he \r\ndid what he did. ",
        "Frank: Does it matter? Does a reason really matter at all? Does it, pop? It \r\ndoesn't change anything on that tape. ",
        "Harley: What tape? ",
        "Lizzie: Coming up on ",
        "\"guiding light\"... ",
        "Harley: Tell me, how bad is this? ",
        "Buzz: As bad as it gets. ",
        "Dinah: I don't know who you can't keep your eyes off of, me or her. ",
        "Frank: Hey. Come here, you. Look how beautiful you look. ",
        "Harley: You're not too obvious, are you? ",
        "Frank: Hey, what are you doing here? Look, gus could be walking through that \r\ndoor any second and see you. Come on. ",
        "Harley: What are you watching? ",
        "Buzz: Don't you have a wedding to get ready for? ",
        "Harley: I saw something. I know this is bad. ",
        "Frank: Come on, sis. No, it'S... ",
        "Harley: Look, I don't want any lies, frank! I don't want any game-playing, \r\nokay? Just tell me. How bad is this? ",
        "Buzz: As bad as it gets. ",
        "Reva: I know the feeling. ",
        "Michelle: Which one? I've got a lot to choose from. ",
        "Reva: That you'd like to be anywhere but where you are. ",
        "Michelle: Top of the list. Nicely done. ",
        "Reva: Wishing people wouldn't talk about your own wedding day or anything \r\nthat has anything to do with your past that you can't remember. ",
        "Michelle: Tied for first. ",
        "Reva: You know, I wasn't talking about that before, your wedding to danny.\r\n",
        "Michelle: Yeah, well, you would have been the only one, so... ",
        "Reva: Mind if I ask you why you don't want to hear about it? ",
        "Michelle: Only if you mind if I don't tell you. ",
        "Reva: You've had it pretty easy, you know. ",
        "Michelle: Really? ",
        "Reva: Yeah. ",
        "Michelle: \"Easy\"? ",
        "Reva: Yeah. People treating you with kid gloves. \"Don't talk about this, \r\ndon't talk about that, give her room to breathe.\" ",
        "Michelle: I seem to remember you encouraging that, too. ",
        "Reva: Finding yourself, yes. But in the process of finding yourself, you're \r\nalso responsible for your actions. You're hurting people, michelle. ",
        "Michelle: You mean danny. ",
        "Reva: Besides the birth of your son, the day he married you was the best day \r\nof his life. And to have you say \"don't talk about it, don't even mention it...\"\r\n",
        "Michelle: I don't remember it, okay? It means nothing to me. ",
        "Reva: Well, it meant the world to him. ",
        "Michelle: And you don't think I know that? You don't think I care that I'm \r\nhurting him? Of course, I do. ",
        "Reva: Then show it. I know this isn't easy for you. But if you're not willing \r\nto let the people who love you love you, then I don't know, michelle. I ju... \r\nyou've had a raw deal from top to bottom, but you remember how to tie your \r\nshoes, right? Drive a car? Read a book? ",
        "Michelle: Your point? ",
        "Reva: Then you must remember how to treat someone who's done nothing but love \r\nyou. ",
        "Gus: Just let me go. ",
        "Alan: No. Let you go and ruin your life? No, I'm not going to do that, \r\nbecause this is your wedding day. You and harley love each other. ",
        "Gus: I owe her this. If I don't do it now, I don't deserve to marry her. ",
        "Harley: I don't want any stories. I don't want any excuses. I just want the \r\ntruth. ",
        "Frank: Sis, don't do this right now. ",
        "Harley: What is on that tape?! ",
        "Buzz: You can walk out of this room right now, forget you saw us, okay? It's \r\nnot too late. You just walk out that door, pull down your veil, go marry the man \r\nyou love. ",
        "Frank: Sis, you have worked so hard to get here. You've been through so much.\r\n",
        "Buzz: So$many disappointments. Go ahead. Do yourself a favor. Walk. ",
        "Harley: You know I can't do that. Just put on the tv. Don't look at him, dad.\r\n",
        "Put on the tv. ",
        "Gus: So, it's you. ",
        "You're the pipeline of ",
        "antimonious to the mob, huh? ",
        "Alexandra: Gus, you don't ",
        "know what you're talking about. ",
        "Gus: I'd love to see you try ",
        "and explain this to alan. ",
        "Alexandra: Oh. ",
        "Alan can't know. ",
        "No, you can't tell anyone, gus. ",
        "Gus: Oh, no? ",
        "What, is this supposed to be ",
        "our dirty little secret? ",
        "Alexandra: Come on, you and i ",
        "can talk. ",
        "Please don't do anything that ",
        "we will both regret... ",
        "Sheryl: Mm-mm. Okay, well, don't take off any more of these clothes because i \r\nwant to do that. ",
        "Tony: Mm-hmm? ",
        "Sheryl: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Michelle: You told me to stay ",
        "away from you. ",
        "I know, but I can'T. ",
        "I need you here. ",
        "I'm at this wedding, and it's a ",
        "nightmare. ",
        "Everyone wants to talk about my ",
        "wedding for some reason. ",
        "I'm practically hiding in the ",
        "bushes. ",
        "Of course, danny is no help. ",
        "He just looks sad when I try to ",
        "explain. ",
        "It's just not me, you know? ",
        "And I know I'm bugging you, and ",
        "it's just really hard. ",
        "You make it easier. ",
        "Sheryl: Hey. ",
        "Tony: You're going to kill me. Sheryl, you are. I am sorry, but that phone \r\ncall I got, I've got to go. ",
        "Sheryl: Tony. ",
        "Tony: I'm sorry. ",
        "Sheryl: Okay. Well... do you... you do see me, right? I mean, smart, funny, \r\nbaseball fan like you, got legs that go down to the ground? ",
        "Tony: Mm-hmm. Trust me, I see that. I do. ",
        "Sheryl: Okay. And that's not enough? ",
        "Tony: (Sighs) I will make it up to you. ",
        "Sheryl: Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay. You know? This is really becoming a bad habit.\r\n",
        "Tony: I am sorry. ",
        "Sheryl: Yeah. ",
        "Tony: Can I at least... here, just let me walk you to your car, okay? ",
        "Sheryl: You know what, darling? I have managed all this time by myself. Do me \r\na favor, though. Think twice before you call me again. ",
        "Tony: You're an idiot. ",
        "Michelle: So, are all ex- mobsters this sappy? ",
        "Danny: Were you watching me? How long have you been doing that? ",
        "Michelle: Not long. You thinking about us? ",
        "Danny: Don't worry, I won't say a word. ",
        "Michelle: It's okay. Tell me about our weddings. All of them. ",
        "Jeffrey: Is this thing ever going to get off the ground, or what? ",
        "Ross: Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing. It's hard to officiate at a \r\nwedding when you don't have a bride and a groom. ",
        "Cassie: You have nothing to worry about. You have two people who can't wait \r\nto put rings on their fingers. ",
        "Ross: Ah. Well, I'll go find out what's going on. ",
        "Cassie: You know what I love about weddings? ",
        "Jeffrey: Um, elbowing other women in the ribs when you're on all fours, \r\ndesperately trying to grab the bouquet? ",
        "Cassie: No. Although that is a lot of fun. I just think it makes you better. \r\nI mean, you're one thing and the other person is the other thing, and together, \r\nyou're just better. ",
        "Jeffrey: Unless that person brings out the absolute worst in you. ",
        "Dinah: What about this? ",
        "Jeffrey: What are you doing? ",
        "Dinah: Well, I'm cassie, with ",
        "some hot glass heels, with a ",
        "lot of dollar bills in a bikini ",
        "string. ",
        "Jeffrey: That is not who ",
        "cassie is. ",
        "Dinah: Really? ",
        "Fine. ",
        "I see you want princess cassie. ",
        "Right? ",
        "I can do that. ",
        "The pleasure would be all mine. ",
        "I don't know who you can't keep ",
        "your eyes off of, me or her. ",
        "Jeffrey: Well, there's a few ",
        "things to iron out, but I think ",
        "it's going to work. ",
        "As a matter of fact, I think ",
        "you're perfect. ",
        "Dinah (sarcastically): ",
        "Great. ",
        "Jeffrey: That's your job, by ",
        "the way, you know? ",
        "To be perfect. ",
        "Dinah: Well, that's what the ",
        "world needs, you know, another ",
        "version of perfect. ",
        "That's what they used to call ",
        "her, you know? ",
        "\"Miss perfect.\" ",
        "Everybody used to say that, how ",
        "perfect she was. ",
        "Perfect little blondie, you ",
        "know? ",
        "They should have made a doll of ",
        "her. ",
        "Yeah. ",
        "You know, ruin an entire ",
        "generation. ",
        "\"You, too, can have a tramp ",
        "with a tiara. ",
        "All you need is a prince and a ",
        "sprinkle of magic.\" ",
        "Jeffrey: Your bitterness is ",
        "showing. ",
        "Dinah: Really? ",
        "That's funny, because I don't ",
        "taste bitter. ",
        "Look at me, jeffrey. ",
        "Look at me. ",
        "You could have both. ",
        "Cassie: Hello? ",
        "Ross: Jeffrey? ",
        "Cassie: Hello? ",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. Yeah, what? ",
        "Ross: Well, I was just thinking that weddings do funny things to people-- you \r\nknow, bring up all those issues: What could have been, what could be, what was.\r\n",
        "Jeffrey: (Laughs) you know me. I've made it my life's work to avoid all \r\nthat, ross. ",
        "Cassie: No, you have the wrong number, okay? Get a clue. ",
        "Ross: What was that? ",
        "Cassie: Someone keeps crank calling me and asking for blondie. ",
        "Alexandra: Alan? Alan, it's getting late. Don't you think we should ask \r\neveryone to sit? ",
        "Alan: I doubt if anything is going to happen anytime soon, alexandra. ",
        "Alexandra: Why do you say that? ",
        "Alan: It's ironic, don't you think, that we should have to pay for the \r\nrighteous deeds of others, rather than share in them? He's always been better \r\nthan us. We knew that. ",
        "Gus: Yeah, and he's going to prosecute you for drug trafficking. ",
        "I know what I saw. ",
        "Alexandra: But you don't have ",
        "a shred of proof, do you? ",
        "Alan: Yes, he does. ",
        "Harley: (Whimpers) ",
        "Frank: Oh, sis. ",
        "Harley: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. ",
        "Buzz: Harley. ",
        "Harley: Can I have the room for a minute, please? Please? Please? (Crying)\r\n",
        "Danny: That was... and our last wedding was... it was kind of unusual. You \r\nwere on this side, I was there, and ray was there, jeffrey o'neill officiated. \r\nIf you don't mind, I will not ask him over here for his take on the whole thing.\r\n",
        "Michelle: That's find by me. You know, I did see it on tape a couple weeks \r\nago. It just didn't really register at the time. ",
        "Danny: Yeah, that's okay. That's all right. Yeah, we... well, first we tried \r\nto do this... this wham-bam vegas style thing, but it was too depressing. ",
        "Michelle: So we left. ",
        "Danny: Yeah, we got out of there. We went to your family's barbecue, and \r\neverybody was gone, or we thought they were gone. But tony and marah were there, \r\nand we were telling them what we tried to do, and they kind of tricked us into \r\nsaying what we would've said if we had gone through with the wedding. And before \r\nwe knew it, when we were done, everybody just kind of appeared out of nowhere, \r\nand the vows were official. ",
        "Michelle: So that's it? ",
        "Danny: That was it. ",
        "Michelle: So what did we say? ",
        "Danny: What, do you mean the vows? I don't know. I don't really remember. ",
        "Michelle: Yeah, you do. ",
        "Danny: (Chuckles) ",
        "Michelle: You remember every word. Come on. I want to hear it. ",
        "Danny: Well, you said something like if all the troubles that we had gone \r\nthrough were going to be worth it, then we had to remember and really know that \r\nwhat we have is too special to take for granted, ever. ",
        "Michelle: And what'd you say? ",
        "Danny: I said... I said that I'm lucky to have found you, the greatest love \r\nof my life, and your love makes me more than whole. ",
        "Michelle: Wow. We made that up? ",
        "Danny: Yeah. ",
        "Michelle: That'S... that's pretty perfect, isn't it? ",
        "Danny: It wasn't bad. ",
        "Michelle: Thanks. Thanks for telling me. ",
        "Danny: Thank you for wanting to know. ",
        "Michelle: You know what? I do want to know. ",
        "Cassie: Hey. ",
        "Jeffrey: Huh. Oh, hi. ",
        "Cassie: Is something wrong? ",
        "Jeffrey: Nothing's wrong. But I do have to go find someone over here, if you \r\ndon't mind. Sorry. I'm sorry. ",
        "Waitress: Can I get you something? ",
        "Jeffrey: No. No, no, I'm sorry. ",
        "Frank: I don't know, pop. It's awfully quiet in there. ",
        "Buzz: We should have stopped her, frank. ",
        "Frank: How? ",
        "Buzz: We should have pulled her out and pushed her to the altar. ",
        "Frank: And then what? ",
        "Buzz: Why'd you have to bring me that tape? Today of all days? ",
        "Frank: Exactly what was i supposed to do, dad? Find gus, tell jeffrey, or \r\njust start hand-cuffing people? ",
        "Marina: Dad? ",
        "Frank: Oh, hey baby. Oh, you look beautiful. ",
        "Marina: Thank you. I found this at home. It's from darcy. ",
        "Phillip: Uh, if we had a bride, we could get this thing going. ",
        "Gus: Yeah, you just came to get her, to tell her? ",
        "Phillip: Well, I was going to enlist one of the bridesmaids to do the honors, \r\nbut yeah, we're ready. ",
        "Gus: All right. Can I just... I just need a minute with harley, okay? ",
        "Phillip: Okay. Um... you do what you have to do. I'll take care of things out \r\nhere. ",
        "Gus: So, it's you. You're the pipeline of antimonious to the mob, huh? ",
