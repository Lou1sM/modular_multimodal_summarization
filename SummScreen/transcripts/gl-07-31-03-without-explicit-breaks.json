        "Reva returned to Springfield from Milan. Reva and Josh agree that it's easy to put their own problems in perspective after the tragedy with Ben. Ben was transported to Cedars after injecting himself with a toxic drug. Phillip bribed a housekeeper to let him into Olivia's room at The Beacon so he could put their baby's crib together. Jeffrey gets Ben to confess to four of the murders while he is in the hospital. Marina tells Buzz and Darcy that Ben turned the needle on himself for her sake. Ben told Ross to give all of his inheritance money to Marina. Ben died at Cedars with Holly at his bedside. Marina didn't say good-bye."

Ane words of that fatal song come over me like a chill: 'A boy's will is the wind's will and the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts. And deering's wo s are fresh and fair, and with joyha almost in myeart gs ba twander there and among the dreams of the days that were I find my lost youth again. And the strange and beautiful song, the groves are r eating it st l, a boy's will is the wind's will, and the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.'\"",
