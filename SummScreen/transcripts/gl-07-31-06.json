        "Alan-Michael: I realize Harley just instituted that program, but it isn't cost- efficient. What do you think I want you to do? Scrap it. (Knock on the door) Someone's here. I'll call you back. Beth. Alone. What happened? Did you finally wake up and send Alan to Rome by himself?",
        "Beth: We missed our flight.",
        "Alan-Michael: Lucky for me. Come in.",
        "Beth: Alan-Michael, Alan needs your help.",
        "Alan-Michael: Does he?",
        "Beth: He's been arrested.",
        "Alan-Michael: Again?",
        "Beth: No... he had a concealed weapon in his carry- on.",
        "Alan-Michael: Well, that was dumb.",
        "Beth: Lizzie planted it. She set him up.",
        "Alan-Michael: (Laughs)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Oh my God, you are amazing! That was brilliant!",
        "Lizzie: (Laughs) Really?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah! I wish I could have been there to see it go down. I mean, I couldn't have even done it better myself. Oh. And I am sorry about before.",
        "Tammy: You thought she was running away with your kid. You didn't want that.",
        "Jonathan: No. I didn't want that, but you knew it wasn't going to work out like that.",
        "Tammy: I had faith. And look at you two, now. Working together, getting along. Maybe I should get knocked on the head more often.",
        "Jonathan: No, no. I'm not letting you out of my sight from now on.",
        "Lizzie: We're free now. Right? I mean, at least for a little while, anyway.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, yeah. You know, I wish I could have been there to see the look on Alan's face when he got his strip search, but he's not going to be in there forever. When he gets out he's going to be mad as hell.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Come here. I'm sorry.",
        "Ava: Mmm, I can't get used to the fact that I can actually kiss you whenever I want.",
        "Buzz: Ooh, young love. I remember it well.",
        "Coop: Remember it well? Dad, you're living it right now. You and Olivia, come on.",
        "Buzz: Well, let's not get carried away right in front of Ava. I'm not sure Ava's forgiven me yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Knocks on the door)",
        "Reva: Cassie? Hey, sis. It's me. Hello? (Phone rings) Hello?",
        "Colin: Reva, it's Colin. I just wanted to call to apologize again for leaving Minnesota so quickly. I... I should have called to discuss it first and I'm... I'm sorry.",
        "Reva: Yeah, you should have, but you know what? It's okay because guess what? I followed you back, Doc.",
        "Colin: You're in Springfield?",
        "Reva: Sure am.",
        "Colin: Does Josh know?",
        "Reva: Not yet. I'm actually at my sister's place.",
        "Colin: You're at your sister's house? Reva, you should be home. You... you can't be running all over town.",
        "Reva: Yeah, I know. I'm not planning on staying long.",
        "Colin: Okay, well, listen. Take it easy and I want to see you for a check-up soon.",
        "Reva: Check-up. Sounds so harmless. Only need a check-up to tell me whether or not I'm going to live or die.",
        "Colin: Good night, Reva. And good luck.",
        "Reva: Thanks. I'm going to need it. You've waited long enough, Josh. It's time for you to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Thank goodness you came out here. Oh my God, I feel so stupid.",
        "Josh: No, don't. Don't be ridiculous. Just relax and breath, okay? You're going to be all right.",
        "Cassie: I don't know what happened, I was just swimming, and then I had cramps. How did you know to come out here?",
        "Josh: Chase's mom called. Something about them being late, so I came out here to find you and find you... you okay?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. I will be. I'm normally a strong swimmer. I've never had a scare like that before. God. You saved me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Alan-Michael laughing)",
        "Beth: Are you almost finished?",
        "Alan-Michael: I don't know. Does the story get any better? Did Lizzie throw in a can opener or citrus juicer or something?",
        "Beth: This is not funny, Alan-Michael.",
        "Alan-Michael: It's a little bit funny.",
        "Beth: Okay, maybe it is just a little bit funny, but I have no sense of humor when it comes to my daughter running off with Jonathan Randall.",
        "Alan-Michael: Is that what this is about?",
        "Beth: Yes. We had her all convinced to go to Italy, to have her baby there, but obviously, somebody got in her head-- she had other plans.",
        "Alan-Michael: Why don't you just leave her alone? It's not like she's marrying the guy, right?",
        "Beth: No, no. He's in love with Tammy, that's the whole point.",
        "Alan-Michael: Well, why do you need me? If you want to bail Alan out, just use his money.",
        "Beth: This is not about money. You are the CEO of Spaulding Enterprises, you can make things happen.",
        "Alan-Michael: I can, can't I? But do I really want to?",
        "Beth: Don't toy with me on this.",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm not. Alan's never lifted a finger to help me. I don't owe him a thing.",
        "Beth: Well, you know something? This isn't about Alan and it's not about you or your screwed up relationship with one another. This is about Lizzie. You can make this whole thing just go away. Do it for Lizzie.",
        "Alan-Michael: It doesn't sound like she'd appreciate it all that much. I mean, she obviously thought things would be a hell of a lot better with Alan out of the picture, and I don't disagree. You know, this could be a golden opportunity for you.",
        "Beth: You know what? Forget it. I will just take care of things myself and I will be sure to tell Alan how helpful you were.",
        "Alan-Michael: Wait. Although Alan deserves what he gets, I am the head of this family. Which means that I am responsible for protecting Spaulding's against any outside threat. I'll make some calls.",
        "Beth: Thank you.",
        "Alan-Michael: You know, it becomes clear to me every day how much this family needs me. Take care, Beth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: All right, the first thing we're going to do is find the guys who did this to you.",
        "Tammy: The cops will do that.",
        "Jonathan: Sure they will.",
        "Lizzie: Did I mess up? Is this just gonna make things worse for us and the baby?",
        "Jonathan: No, no, what you did was brilliant, okay? And Alan totally deserved it. I'm just saying that...",
        "Lizzie: He's going to retaliate.",
        "Jonathan: Uh-huh.",
        "Lizzie: Well, I believe that you can protect me and our baby.",
        "Tammy: As long as we don't do it by making things any worse.",
        "Jonathan: I'm just going to go see how long Alan's going to be on ice.",
        "Tammy: Where are you going?",
        "Jonathan: I'll be back soon. You stay with her?",
        "Lizzie: Of course. Thank you. Be careful.",
        "Jonathan: Okay.",
        "Lizzie: Don't worry, Tammy, I'm sure he'll be fine.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I'd like an appointment with the man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Hey.",
        "Buzz: Hey.",
        "Ava: I'm sorry things have been a little strained between us. Just... I love you and Frank and how close you guys are and I don't want anything to mess that up. Anything, anyone, meaning Olivia.",
        "Coop: Women. Nothing but trouble. I'm telling you.",
        "Ava: Not all of us are.",
        "Buzz: Right.",
        "Ava: Speaking of trouble, I hope that Olivia doesn't cause any more trouble for this family. She just offered me a job. It's not going to be easy working for her if she's wreaking havoc.",
        "Buzz: Well, it's up to me not to let that happen, right? So, are we friends again?",
        "Ava: Yes. Give me a hug.",
        "Buzz: Aw!",
        "Coop: All right, come here. Aw, yeah. Oh, okay, that's... thanks, Dad, that's not exactly what I had in mind, but thanks, anyways. I appreciate the gesture. You, come here. This is much better.",
        "Buzz: Should I put \"closed\" on the door, huh? Get rooms.",
        "Ava: You know, I cannot get used to the fact that we can do this whenever we want.",
        "Coop: Mmm.",
        "Ava: I'm so used to staring at you across the room and wishing things were different.",
        "Coop: I know, jeez. I guess everything's as it's supposed to be now, though, right?",
        "Ava: I know, I feel like ever since we're together my feet haven't touched the ground. I feel empowered. I feel like I can take on the world.",
        "Buzz: You like to take on the world, do you, huh?",
        "Ava: Yeah, absolutely.",
        "Buzz: How about taking on that customer?",
        "Ava: I was hoping to have a Spaulding-free night.",
        "Coop: You know what? I'll take care of it. I'll be right back.",
        "Ava: No, wait, wait, wait. No, you're not. No, it's cool, I got it. It's fine. You worked hard today. Anyway, I kind of feel sorry for him.",
        "Coop: You...",
        "Ava: I'll be back. Hi. What can I get you? Hello? What a jerk!",
        "Coop: Well, come on. Ava, you know, I feel sorry for him a little bit. I mean, look at him standing there holding his cell phone and I get to stand here and hold you. Mmm.",
        "Ava: Mmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Joshua? Josh? I'm home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: We don't have to stop, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Yes, we do. I am out of control. I am out of control. A minute ago I was swimming, and then I was drowning and then there you are. Like always.",
        "Josh: Cassie...",
        "Cassie: Do you have any idea how good it feels to be in your arms!? I feel safe with you! I feel protected.",
        "Josh: Look, I couldn't lose you, all right, Cassie? I couldn't lose you. Not like this.",
        "Cassie: I don't know how to deal with this! I keep running from you! I keep avoiding you, I keep ignoring it, I keep...",
        "Josh: I know.",
        "Cassie: I have tried everything.",
        "Josh: And we've tried fighting it.",
        "Cassie: And I would keep running from you. I would go as far away from you and these feelings as I possibly could, but I... something tells me... there is no getting away from it, is there?",
        "Josh: No, ma'am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Josh? Where's the frame? What happened? It must have fallen. The frame broke. Why are you so nervous? It's just Josh. It's just Josh. All you have to tell him is that you've got... (cell phone alarm goes off) Pill time. Bottled water. We always have bottled water.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Why are you doing this? This can't happen. We're playing with fire.",
        "Josh: You think I don't know that? You think I don't think that exact same thought a thousand times a day? I came here tonight-- well, I was going to give R.J. H.B.'s medal-- but I was also going to say to R.J. that... I wasn't going to be able to be around as much as I had been lately. Because-- I don't know-- work has gotten so crazy.",
        "Cassie: Well, you can still tell him that, Josh.",
        "Josh: We'll just be pulled together again.",
        "Cassie: By what? Fate? That's a Josh and Reva thing. That's a Josh and Reva thing. This is us, I think, just not being strong enough to fight what we know is wrong.",
        "Josh: Okay, my head tells me exactly the same thing. But none of this... none of this feels bad to me.",
        "Cassie: Really? Because it feels bad to me. It feels bad to enjoy kissing my sister's husband. God, to want...",
        "Josh: Running away isn't the answer, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Then what is, Josh? What is the answer?",
        "Josh: I don't know. I do know that we can't sit around here all night in wet clothes. So I'm going to take you back to my house.",
        "Cassie: No.",
        "Josh: Cassie. There's power at my house, okay? And we have to deal with this.",
        "Cassie: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: Listen, I'm at the restaurant. I'll call you back, okay? Can I order?",
        "Ava: Sure. Is that going to be to go?",
        "Alan-Michael: That would be why I'm standing here.",
        "Ava: What would you like? (Cell phone rings)",
        "Alan-Michael: Oh... hello, Alan-Michael Spaulding. Candy, hi. Actually, I'm not going to be able to make it. Yeah, I'm sorry, too, but I have to fly to Brussels. Of course I'll call you back when I get back. Yeah, you too. Did you get that?",
        "Ava: Yeah, you're going to miss your date with Candy because you have to fly to Brussels, but you'll call her when you get back.",
        "Alan-Michael: My order.",
        "Ava: You didn't give it to me.",
        "Alan-Michael: I want a grilled chicken salad with balsamic vinaigrette and... (cell phone rings)",
        "Alan-Michael: Yeah. Okay. Just schedule a meeting for next Tuesday. And tell his people that...",
        "Ava: Hey, you know what?",
        "Alan-Michael: Hey.",
        "Ava: Your time is no more important than mine. Do you want that dressing on the side?",
        "Alan-Michael: Yes.",
        "Ava: I'll put your order in right away.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, boss man.",
        "Alan-Michael: There's my date.",
        "Jonathan: That's for taking the meeting. (Laughs) Thank you for taking this meeting. So what are we going to do about your old man?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Joshua. I have cancer. Can't you tell? I've been sick. I've been sick for a few months now. I thought I could beat it and spare you having to go through all this, but... I'm not so sure now. It's kind of a wait and see time. So...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle Ray Smith \"Inside The Light.\" I have four dogs and... Seamus and Tutti and Bertie and Begeez. (Laughs) And I have two French bulldogs and two rotweilers and they're spoiled rotten and they're like my children. And I love taking care of them and loving them. It makes me really, really happy. See Ava Wednesday August 2, \"Inside The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Oh... oh, Billy! Oh, thank God it's you!",
        "Billy: Whoa. That's the kind of greeting I like. Where's Josh?",
        "Reva: I don't know. I don't have any idea but I can't tell you how glad I am it was you that walked through that door and that I don't have to face him looking like this.",
        "Billy: Like what?",
        "Reva: Like this, like this. Like this person that I am now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Hey. I feel better.",
        "Josh: Good. That's all I wanted.",
        "Cassie: Thank you again, Josh. I don't even want to think about what would have happened if you hadn't come out there when you did.",
        "Josh: Yeah, me neither.",
        "Cassie: Do you want to...? You know, I'm sure I could find something dry for you to put on.",
        "Josh: I'm okay, thank you.",
        "Cassie: And thank you for bringing me back here. I just needed to... (cell phone rings)",
        "Cassie: Hello? Oh, Cindy, hi. Yeah, my brother-in-law told me you called. Sure, okay. Just tell R.J. I'll pick him up in the morning. Thanks, you have a good night, too. Bye. So R.J. is spending the night at his friend Chase's tonight.",
        "Josh: I don't suppose there's any chance I could... any chance that you would change your mind and come on back to the house with me tonight. I mean, I do have air- conditioning and lights.",
        "Cassie: I can't, Josh. I can't.",
        "Josh: That's... that's exactly what I figured you would say. I'd be a gentleman.",
        "Cassie: You always are. But I still don't think it's a good idea.",
        "Josh: You know, I didn't really ask for this to happen. I didn't see it coming.",
        "Cassie: Neither of us did.",
        "Josh: I really thought that things were going to work out with me and Reva this time. My hopes were really high this time. And for about a minute it was really nice. We were building the hospital together, and I believed that somehow we might keep it together, but we couldn't.",
        "Cassie: It's not too late.",
        "Josh: I think it is.",
        "Cassie: Josh, you know that it's not your fault.",
        "Josh: Yeah. Sort of the same way that it's not our fault that we feel the way we do about each other.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, except that we shouldn't... we can't...",
        "Josh: We did. It happened. It's here, and it's real. And it's not going away.",
        "Cassie: Well, then I should pack up R.J. and we should leave Springfield.",
        "Josh: What? No. No. Cassie, I'm not going to let you leave me, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Well, I asked the nurse to call a taxi for us.",
        "Tammy: Thanks. Thanks for coming back. Jonathan would never admit it, but he was really worried when he thought you went to Italy.",
        "Lizzie: He was?",
        "Tammy: The baby's starting to mean a lot to him.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, I do not get you.",
        "Tammy: What's not to get?",
        "Lizzie: You're being really nice to me. Okay, you're actually encouraging Jonathan and I to bond over the baby. It's weird. If this was my boyfriend and he got some girl pregnant...",
        "Tammy: Let's not talk about that part of it.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. So you're not okay with it.",
        "Tammy: Let's just say that when I start to think about it, I suddenly don't feel so nice anymore.",
        "Lizzie: Do you hate me?",
        "Tammy: No. I was upset. I just try not to think about it.",
        "Lizzie: But you have to. Sometimes.",
        "Tammy: Sure. But I'm not going to challenge you to a showdown on \"Jerry Springer,\" if that's what you're worried about.",
        "Lizzie: (Laughs) I can see my granddad's face already.",
        "Tammy: Lizzie, your baby is important to all of us. We just have to make it work. Whatever happened with you and Jonathan isn't the point anymore. You're getting along; that's what matters.",
        "Lizzie: He is so much more... so much more than everybody thinks he is.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, I've known him for a long time. He's going to be a great dad to your little girl. He's loyal, protective, and he loves like nobody I've ever met in my life. Sure, it can be kind of intense, but that's what's amazing. Oh, the way he loves with that intensity, it's the most powerful thing you can imagine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Uh-oh. Going outside. Should I be worried?",
        "Alan-Michael: You mean am I planning to have you kidnapped and disappeared? Relax, I don't travel with goons.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, not yet.",
        "Alan-Michael: I heard about that little trick with Alan at the airport. Were you involved?",
        "Jonathan: (Laughs) No, no, that was all Lizzie.",
        "Alan-Michael: Nice work. And I'd pay money for those security tapes.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, I know, me, too. Me, too. I'm glad you said that, though. I mean, I called you because I know you care about your niece, Lizzie, and I want you to help me keep Alan away from her and my kid.",
        "Alan-Michael: I understand. Alan's messed up every kid unfortunate enough to grow up in his cross-hairs. He'll probably screw up yours too if you let him. But that's not my problem. It's yours.",
        "Jonathan: Huh?",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm the CEO of Spaulding Enterprises.",
        "Jonathan: I'm the C.E.O. of bite me industries. What's your point?",
        "Alan-Michael: Do yourself a favor and forget you ever heard the name Spaulding. Don't take us on.",
        "Jonathan: Us? I thought you and your old man hated each other.",
        "Alan-Michael: Oh, we do. But I'm the head of this family, and as such I will protect it against any challenge that comes from an outsider. Say what you want about my family, but we stick together, protect our own, even dear old dad.",
        "Jonathan: Are you for real right now?",
        "Alan-Michael: Do I look like I'm kidding? Declare war on my father, Jonathan, and you declare war on me. And I'll do a lot more than cancel your credit cards.",
        "Jonathan: We are not finished yet.",
        "Alan-Michael: Touch me again, you'll find out just how finished we are.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I called this meeting; you're the one doing all the talking.",
        "Alan-Michael: I took your meeting because I was curious. I'm done now.",
        "Jonathan: Big boss man, huh? You like that, don't you? I bet you were that kid in high school gym class picked last, skinny little nerd. Now you get all the attention, don't you, slick?",
        "Alan-Michael: Is there a point to this?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. You're not my boss. I don't know much about business, I don't even know what Spaulding does, I don't care. What I do care about is Tammy and that kid. You started a new job. You care about your company, you're still trying to prove yourself. I'm guessing that's a real pain when you have a board of directors to answer to. A board of directors which probably doesn't care much for bad publicity, which, you've been getting a lot of lately, mostly due to your old man. So, why not stop him? Stop him, before he forces me to do something really, really stupid which just might embarrass you. How's that for a deal?",
        "Alan-Michael: What would you get in return?",
        "Jonathan: I would get to live my life without having to worry about Alan coming after me, or Tammy or my kid. That's not so tough, is it?",
        "Alan-Michael: All right. Consider it done. But don't get any ideas about coming after Alan or Spaulding money. Then we'll have a very big problem.",
        "Jonathan: Well, you just take care of Alan, and we won't have any problems.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I don't think I can tell him, Billy.",
        "Billy: Well, darling, that's the reason we came back here.",
        "Reva: Yeah, I know, but I don't think I've thought the whole thing through.",
        "Billy: He's not going to care what you look like, sweetie.",
        "Reva: No, it's me.",
        "Billy: What...?",
        "Reva: It's... it's... it's me. And what I'm laying on his doorstep.",
        "Billy: Darling, you are going to be giving him his wife back.",
        "Reva: No, no, I'm not his wife. I'm not even a shell of that woman. And I don't think I'll ever be her again, you know, Reva Shayne, the scarlet woman, I mean, there... there was a time when I thought that that's what I was always going to be, you know, invincible. The little spitfire that could. But now, I mean, I know better. I know that we get older and I know we get sick, and I know that when Josh and I got married, we promised that we would always love each other and he's had that burden over and over and over again and that's why I didn't tell him about the cancer in the first place.",
        "Billy: Sweetie, I thought we got past this already.",
        "Reva: Yeah, yeah. Well, I thought we did too, but, you know, I, I'm selfish. I don't know what the future holds. I mean, after I see Colin maybe I will. I mean, if I'm getting better, then great, maybe I won't be a burden. But if I'm not, then I, at least I can be glad that I've spared Josh the roller coaster ride.",
        "Billy: Come on, he loves the roller coaster ride.",
        "Reva: Maybe...",
        "Billy: Yeah.",
        "Reva: One time he did, but I'm not so sure now. I just have to know, Billy. I mean, what could be the harm?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I should go far away. I should get far away from you. But I know me. I won't. I can't. I just want what's best for everybody.",
        "Josh: So do I. But what if it's...",
        "Tammy: Mom?",
        "Cassie: Oh, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: What are you doing?",
        "Cassie: I was... the power went out, and I went for a swim by the pond and Josh came out at just the right time, thank goodness, and, you are out of the hospital! (Laughs) That's great!",
        "Tammy: Yeah, I just got released. I thought I would surprise you.",
        "Cassie: You certainly did, it's a great surprise. Right?",
        "Josh: Yes, it is. How you doing? It's good to see you out of bed. You're okay, right? Because they like to release patients before it's really time, and, you know...",
        "Tammy: I feel fine.",
        "Josh: Good. Excellent, great, fantastic. I guess I'll go. Tell R.J. I wish him the best of luck tomorrow, okay?",
        "Cassie: I will.",
        "Josh: I'll see you.",
        "Cassie: Thanks. Thank you, again.",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: So, you're... I'm so happy to see you!",
        "Tammy: Are you? Because I kind of feel like maybe I'm the last person you want to see right now. Except for maybe Aunt Reva.",

        "Ava: Did you forget something?",
        "Alan-Michael: Oh, yeah. I got a message from Tokyo. I had to take off.",
        "Ava: Mmm, and here I thought Jonathan rattled you.",
        "Alan-Michael: Rattled?",
        "Ava: Yeah.",
        "Alan-Michael: Funny.",
        "Ava: What is it with you Spaulding's? You act like the whole world lives to serve you.",
        "Alan-Michael: Well, life's a bitch and then you brought my salad. Fantastic. I'm starving.",
        "Ava: Come on, you can't just order and walk out. Buzz has to pay for this.",
        "Alan-Michael: Oh, okay. That should cover it.",
        "Ava: I don't have change.",
        "Alan-Michael: Keep it. So this is how the C.E.O. lives. Alone with his take- out. Enjoy.",

        "Jonathan: Well, the baby's safe and you are safe.",

        "Jonathan: Because I took care of it. Alan won't be coming near you or the baby. Our baby. (Laughs) What?",

        "Tammy: I don't want anything.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Well, just let me know if you change your mind. I'd turn on the lights or put the air conditioning on or something, but no such luck. Well, come on and sit down and tell me how you are. R.J. is going to be so happy that you're home.",
        "Tammy: Where is R.J.?",

        "Cassie: If you're thinking that you saw...",
        "Tammy: Mom, just stop. Jonathan joked about this months ago and I said he was crazy. I didn't see it then, but I see it now. There's something going on with you and Josh, isn't there?",

        "Reva: I don't even know where I stand with my life. I mean, am I coming back to him and offering him decades or months? I mean, once I see Colin, then I'll know what I have.",
