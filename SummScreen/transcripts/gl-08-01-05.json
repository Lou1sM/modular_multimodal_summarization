        "Cassie: Ross. Hi. Dinah's not here. I'm sorry.",
        "Ross: That's all right. I'm here to see you. May I come in?",
        "Cassie: I'm not in the mood for an argument right now.",
        "Ross: Good. Neither am I. Cassie, I'm here to say thank you for possibly doing something I have never been able to do: Save Dinah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Exactly. I'll ring you back in a bit.",
        "Dinah: Well, nice little stash you got going on there. Looking for a career in surveillance?",
        "Edmund: It's not what you think, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: Oh, bugs don't bother me. I'm just wondering who you're going to use them on.",
        "Edmund: No one. No one. I was simply putting together a few things so I can take care of some matters that I had...",
        "Dinah: Room 1410. Jeffrey O'Neill's room. Would you like to know about Jeffrey O'Neill? I can give you a little clue. Actually, kind of a boring guy. Orders the same type of food every night from room service. Likes to eat and watch strange action movies. Loves \"Lethal Weapon,\" all 20 of them. His personal hygiene, pretty good.",
        "Edmund: He's also giving Cassie legal advice, and I'd like to be forewarned.",
        "Dinah: He's also sleeping with Cassie. But you are completely over her, so that, you know, shouldn't bother you in the least bit. Should it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: Don't sit there too long. That chair does things to people.",
        "Gus: I don't really like it. I was thinking about selling it.",
        "Blake: Oh, yeah. That'll do it.",
        "Gus: Mm-hmm.",
        "Blake: Hate to ask this, but is Harley here?",
        "Gus: No, she decided not to move in after all.",
        "Blake: Ooh, smart girl. I was wondering if she needed any wedding help, but...?",
        "Gus: Nah, we're kind of keeping the wedding simple.",
        "Blake: No such thing as a simple wedding. Of course, then again, I guess, you know, you don't have to worry about this huge guest list on your side of the aisle.",
        "Gus: Yeah, maybe you and Ross could sit on my side and pretend to be my family.",
        "Blake: Speaking of your family...",
        "Gus: No, no. I wasn't actually. I was only kidding.",
        "Blake: You know, Ross actually has just told me that Alan is claiming that Phillip is still alive.",
        "Gus: Yeah, it's his latest ploy to, you know, get out jail.",
        "Blake: It's a good one.",
        "Gus: Yeah, it's a very good one. It's a good thing that Harley's not falling for it. I think we all need to move on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: ( Gasps ) Mallet! What are you doing here?",
        "Mallet: Well, I heard there was an Open House, and I'm looking into buying a creepy, old building and maybe turning it into a roller rink.",
        "Harley: No. You think there's something to Alan's story.",
        "Mallet: You're here, too.",
        "Harley: Yes.",
        "Mallet: Well, it's... it's just so out there, I can't help but wondering if maybe it's true.",
        "Harley: Hmm.",
        "Mallet: Where's your shadow? You look good. I mean, where's Gus?",
        "Harley: Um... he's busy. And we're not joined at the hip or anything. ( Scoffs )",
        "Mallet: He doesn't even know you're here, does he?",
        "Harley: Why are you so obsessed with Gus?",
        "Mallet: Obsessed? No, no, no. He's Alan's son and Phillip's brother. I think he kind of has a vested interest in this thing.",
        "Harley: Yeah, well, like I said, he's busy.",
        "Mallet: Oh, I'm sure. \"Bye, Honey. You go investigate whether your dangerous and violent ex-husband is still alive, and I'll go pick up the dry cleaning.\"",
        "Harley: Well, maybe he trusts me.",
        "Mallet: Well, then, he's an idiot. Because there's no way that Gus would let you do this by yourself.",
        "Harley: You know, that is a pretty darned sexist thing to say, or maybe you didn't know.",
        "Mallet: Pulling out the sexist card to throw me off the scent. Aha! Now I know I'm right.",
        "Harley: Not to mention patronizing and just plain annoying.",
        "Mallet: I think it's patronizing. Just answer the question, Cooper.",
        "Harley: Okay. I'll be straight with about this.",
        "Mallet: Mm-hmm.",
        "Harley: This is the truth. Have I shared every question and theory I have about this case with Gus in the last 24 hours? No, I haven't. But not for the reasons you think, and it's not like I wouldn't do it eventually. The truth is, like I said, he's busy, okay? He's taking care of his family, which is a mess, and he's planning our wedding, so I don't see any reason to get him all wound up about something that may or may not even be... true.",
        "Mallet: Yeah. Why do that? So, uh... you're still getting married, huh?",
        "Harley: Mm-hmm. Why?",
        "Mallet: Because I want to... I want to give you a gift.",
        "Harley: You do?",
        "Mallet: Mm-hmm. Turn around and go home. Do yourself the same favor you're doing Gus, and let it go.",
        "Harley: Why don't you give me one good reason why I should do that?",
        "Mallet: Oh, I'll give you a great reason: So you don't have to lie to your fiance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: He's lying. Or he's delusional and he just wants it to be true. But you've got to do me a favor. Whatever you do, don't mention it to Harley. I mean, she's got enough on her mind right now, you know what I mean?",
        "Blake: Sure.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Blake: Absolutely.",
        "Gus: Appreciate it.",
        "Blake: ( Sighs ) You know, this is the first time that I have been in this house for a year since your almost wedding.",
        "Gus: Yeah. A year down the toilet.",
        "Blake: Now you can make up for it.",
        "Gus: I intend to. Let me ask you something. You're... you're her girlfriend don't you think that Harley's a little nervous?",
        "Blake: About what?",
        "Gus: Oh, you know, I don't know, history repeating itself or bad karma, deja vu?",
        "Blake: No such thing. Let me ask you something: This wedding...",
        "Gus: Hmm?",
        "Blake: Big or small?",
        "Gus: I'd... I'd say big. I mean, well, you know, casual. It's kind of... I'd like it to be like a block party, you know?",
        "Blake: Ooh, cool. I like that.",
        "Gus: Mm-hmm.",
        "Blake: I like that. So who all are you inviting? I mean, obviously, it's going to be family and close friends...",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Blake: But, you know, anybody from the force? I mean, what about Mallet?",
        "Gus: What about Mallet?",
        "Blake: Well, you do kind of owe him. He is the one that personally cleared Harley, right? But then on the other hand, he is her ex, it kind of makes things right, don't you think? It kind of makes things ripe, don't you think?",
        "Gus: What does that mean: \"Ripe\"?",
        "Blake: Well, nothing, actually. I'm just rambling. So really, what can I do? What can I do?",
        "Gus: I know you're great at that kind of thing, but there's not really... I mean, I'm going over to Company to see a wedding planner in about 15 minutes.",
        "Blake: Hey! I'm going there. I'm going there to meet Ross in a little bit.",
        "Gus: You want to... you want to...?",
        "Blake: So, yeah, I do. I do. Can I just call Ross real quick and I'll meet you?",
        "Gus: Yeah, I'll be outside.",
        "Blake: I'm just going to let him know what's going on and...",
        "Blake: He pretends not to care, but it's eating away at him. It eats at his heart, at his soul. And he is wondering like everyone else: Who does she really love?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: You're right, Dinah. You're right. I'm bugging Jeffrey O'Neill's room because he's Cassie's lover now. And as such, I'm sure she's telling him everything. So if she says something about the divorce or you, I want to know about it.",
        "Dinah: Do you think they talk about me?",
        "Edmund: If they suspect that this pregnancy is fake, the faster we know about it, the faster we can do damage control.",
        "Dinah: Or not. Look, I know that we've prolonged this whole charade just to get back at Cassie, but I cannot help but wonder, why don't we tell the truth?",
        "Edmund: Cassie has to pay for all the pain she's caused us first. Without that we can't truly be free of her.",
        "Dinah: Well, you see, we could be free of her right now. If we came out in the open, told everybody that we were together and that I miscarried.",
        "Edmund: All right, then, where would we live? Certainly not the farm, unless Cassie signs it over to me. And isn't that what you want? I mean, don't you want back the place that once belonged to you and Hart?",
        "Dinah: Well, I used to, but you know what? I really don't think about that much anymore.",
        "Edmund: But, Dinah, it symbolizes everything that Cassie ever took from you: All the happiness you deserve, all the happiness I'm going to give you.",
        "Dinah: Awfully sweet of you. Thank you.",
        "Edmund: Okay. Well, then, I'm going to go off now, because Jeffrey O'Neill is out of town, and I want to drop these things in his room before he gets back.",
        "Dinah: Okay, I'm going to go with you.",
        "Edmund: No, don't do that. Better yet, go out to the farm and occupy Cassie. I don't want her barging in on me. What's wrong, Dinah?",
        "Dinah: Nothing. I'll go see Cassie.",
        "Edmund: Thank you. Thank you. Remember, Dinah, there's a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. It's all worth waiting for in the end.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: I can't believe I'm saying this, but I think that this pregnancy could be the best thing that ever happened to my daughter.",
        "Cassie: Really? Does Vanessa feel the same way?",
        "Ross: Let's say Vanessa is getting there. But Blake, believe it or not, she agrees. And both of us see how much happier that Dinah is and, more importantly, how grounded she is. But that being said, we still have concerns.",
        "Cassie: ( Scoffs ) Who doesn't?",
        "Ross: ( Sighs ) You know, when Dinah has this baby, and that moment comes when she has to hand it over to you, what's going to happen? I mean, it must be painfully difficult even for the strongest woman, so what's going to happen to Dinah? Is she going to continue on this positive track or...?",
        "Cassie: Or go back to her old ways.",
        "Ross: Exactly. I've never been a fan of Edmund's, never will be, but you do seem to be handling this divorce amicably, and that's to be commended.",
        "Cassie: But?",
        "Ross: But with you and Edmund on the outs, that puts Dinah right in the middle, and, naturally, one of you is eventually going to have more influence over her, and I'm hoping that that person is you. That's all I came to say. Good night, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: ( Sighs )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sonya: You're not Jeffrey.",
        "Edmund: No, I'm not, but let's pretend I am for just a little while longer.",
        "Sonya: Well, you are an awfully good kisser. But no, sorry, no substitutions. But... which begs the question: What are you doing here in Jeffrey's room?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "( Knock at the door )",
        "Cassie: Dinah? Hey. Did you forget your key?",
        "Dinah: No, I... I just figured you might be busy. I didn't really want to bother you.",
        "Cassie: I am busy, but there's something I want you to see. In fact, I was going to call you and find out when you were coming home, so come on. ( Sighs ) Okay...",
        "Dinah: Why? What's up?",
        "Cassie: Oh, it's nothing big. I mean, well... it's nothing. I just want to... I want to give you this, and I just finished wrapping it, so there you go.",
        "Dinah: It's us.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Yeah, it's from the baby shower. Mel took it. I think it's a great picture of us. And, look, you... you look so beautiful. It's true what they say. Pregnant women glow, and you're glowing. ( Laughs )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: What am I doing in Jeffrey O'Neill's room? Well, do you want the truth or a wittily fabricated, yet wholly believable lie that I could whip up in an instant?",
        "Sonya: Hmm, that's a tough one. I think I'll take the truth.",
        "Edmund: Oh, all right. Let's see. In a nutshell, I'm separated from my wife. She wants a divorce; I do not. She's shacking up with Jeffrey O'Neill. My only chance of winning her back is to play on the love she has for the child she thinks we're carrying through in-vitro fertilization. The problem is the surrogate who was carrying the child is no longer carrying the child; she miscarried the child. Now, if my wife finds this out, my marriage is over. So I've come here to bug Jeffrey O'Neill's room, thinking that if they talk about it, if they suspect that there is no longer a baby, then I'll catch wind of it. But you've discovered me. Curses, foiled again.",
        "Sonya: ( Laughs ) Bravo! That was marvelous!",
        "Edmund: Yes, it was, wasn't it? A gift of mine.",
        "Sonya: So, how do you really know Jeffrey?",
        "Edmund: Well, I work for him, and I came by to drop off some papers. He gave me the key to his room, but he never told me there was such a beautiful woman stashed in it.",
        "Sonya: Ah, that's because he doesn't know I'm here. It's a surprise.",
        "Edmund: Really? Do you surprise him this way often?",
        "Sonya: Not recently. But we have a little arrangement throughout the years.",
        "Edmund: A little arrangement. How largely sophisticated.",
        "Sonya: And fun. Now, if you will excuse me, I must leave to freshen up.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, my loss. But of course, of course. I'll just stay here and write Jeffrey a little note and leave it along with the papers. And then I'll be on my merry way. It was a delight... it was a delight meeting you.",
        "Sonya: Same.",
        "Edmund: Jeffrey's a very lucky man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: That's a cute baby comforter. Who gave you that?",
        "Cassie: Olivia. Aren't the colors perfect?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. She has good taste. She married my brother.",
        "Cassie: I think there's more pictures... ( Phone ringing ) Excuse me. Hello? Hello? Hello? Oh, that's weird.",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Cassie: Well, that was Jeffrey calling from his Beacon hotel room, but he didn't say anything.",
        "Dinah: Jeffrey's back in town?",
        "Cassie: Well, I guess. You know, I don't even think he knew he called me. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to go surprise him right now.",
        "Dinah: You sure you should go do that?",
        "Cassie: Why not?",
        "Dinah: Because certain people don't like surprises, and I think Jeffrey's one of those people.",
        "Cassie: I'll take my chances. You don't mind that I'm going, do you?",
        "Dinah: No. Uh-uh.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Well, you know what? Look at the pictures. I just went to the grocery store. There is tons of food. RJ's staying at the Marlers. So I will see you tomorrow morning.",
        "Dinah: Shoot. Edmund, if Jeffrey's at the Beacon, then where the heck are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: I don't see the wedding planner.",
        "Blake: Hm.",
        "Gus: All right, well, you want to grab a little...",
        "Blake: Booth?",
        "Gus: Great. The only couple in here. They've got the booth. We'll take the table.",
        "Blake: Okay.",
        "Gus: Okay. So... um, how are you?",
        "Blake: I'm good.",
        "Gus: Yeah?",
        "Blake: Yeah.",
        "Gus: You look good.",
        "Blake: I'm fine.",
        "Gus: Mm-hmm.",
        "Blake: What's up?",
        "Gus: You're acting a little strange, though. Kind of like a Jack Russell terrier.",
        "Blake: Gee, thank you, Gus.",
        "Gus: Well, I'm saying, even for you, it's like a little, you know, strange.",
        "Blake: Keep that up, I'm just going to have to dump Ross for you.",
        "Gus: Hmm. What happened to him? Hey, hey, it's Aimee Johnson. Aimee Johnson. How are you? Right over here.",
        "Aimee: Hello.",
        "Gus: Sorry about that.",
        "Blake: Hi.",
        "Aimee: Hi.",
        "Gus: How are you? This is Aimee Johnson. Now, Aimee is a wedding planner, and we're lucky to have her 'cause she doesn't usually do, like, weddings and bar mitzvahs and stuff. She does, like, rock concerts and big things, big...",
        "Blake: Cool.",
        "Aimee: Well, it's very nice to meet you, and congratulations on your engagement.",
        "Blake: Oh, no, no, no, no. No, no. I... I would not be the bride-to-be. I'm the bride's friend. I'm sure Harley will be here any minute.",
        "Gus: And you have another appointment, right? I'll call her and see where she is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: I'm sorry. You're going to have to remind me when my personal relationship with Gus became your business. Oh, that's right. It's not. ( Phone rings ) You know, ever since I got here...",
        "Mallet: Are you going to answer your phone?",
        "Harley: No, I want to deal with this first. Ever since I got here, you have been grilling me about Gus.",
        "Mallet: Grilling.",
        "Harley: Grilling me.",
        "Mallet: I've been grilling?",
        "Harley: Does he know you're here? Where is he? Are you going to tell him the truth? Why are you keeping it from him?",
        "Mallet: Would you answer your phone, please?",
        "Harley: No! And let me tell you something, I actually have a couple of questions for you, Mr. A.C. Mallet.",
        "Mallet: Okay, fine. Like what?",
        "Harley: Like the most obvious one being, what are you doing here? What are you doing here, Mallet?",
        "Mallet: That's no big secret. I just thought I'd poke around on your behalf and check out Alan's story, so you don't have to do it yourself and you can concentrate on other things, like, happier things.",
        "Harley: Oh.",
        "Mallet: Mm-hmm.",
        "Harley: I appreciate that. I do. And I appreciate you, because Lord knows I would not even be out walking around free if it wasn't for you. But you know what? You've paid your debt. So I release you from your responsibility.",
        "Mallet: I'm not doing this out of guilt, Harley. I'm doing this because I'm in a better position to investigate this than you are.",
        "Harley: Why? Because I'm planning a wedding?",
        "Mallet: Uh, yeah, among other things.",
        "Harley: This might shock you, but I can actually walk and chew gum at the same time.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, but why do you want to? Why don't you allow yourself some happiness for a change? I mean, go pick out a cake. Go register for whatever women register for. Go make your girlfriends really miserable by picking out ugly bridesmaid dresses. Harley ( In little girl's voice ): And let you do the man's work?",
        "Mallet: ( Laughs ) That's not what I said.",
        "Harley: That's exactly what you just said. Pig.",
        "Mallet: You know what? You're being very defensive, and I think it's because you feel bad about lying to Gus, which is another reason you should just drop this and go home.",
        "Harley: It has nothing to do with Gus! This is just me needing to do what I need to do for me. You know, we were partners once.",
        "Mallet: Oh, is that what we're calling it now? We were partners? Oh, we were partners.",
        "Harley: You'd think you'd remember that once I latch on to something I can't let it go. Hey, I'm going to pursue this, okay? With or without your support, Gus or no Gus, because I have a lead.",
        "Mallet: You have a lead?",
        "Harley: And that lead is going...",
        "Mallet: What lead? You have a lead?",
        "Harley: This is my case. You can go now, okay? I have work to do.",
        "Mallet: Okay, I guess you're not interested in the lead that I've developed. Okay, fine, cool. I'll see you around.",
        "Harley: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Stop, stop, stop, stop.",
        "Mallet: What?",
        "Harley: You have a lead? What lead do you have? What?",
        "Mallet: Oh, I'm sorry. I... oh, do you want me to stay now? I'll tell you what, Harley. I'll show you mine if you show me yours.",
        "Harley: What's your lead, Mallet?",
        "Mallet: You first.",
        "Harley: Pink tulips.",
        "Mallet: Pink tulips?",
        "Harley: A beautiful arrangement of pink tulips was delivered to Elizabeth Spaulding this evening.",
        "Mallet: Okay, that's kind of touching, but I don't see what it has to do with...",
        "Harley: No card.",
        "Mallet: Yeah?",
        "Harley: Just a name: \"Lizzie.\" Phillip used to send Lizzie pink tulips every week when he was alive.",
        "Mallet: Really? That's kind of interesting.",
        "Harley: Yes.",
        "Mallet: But hardly conclusive. Well, I guess if that's all you got...",
        "Harley: Wait. Wait. Hey, you said you'd share. Reciprocity.",
        "Mallet: Uh, yeah, but I thought it'd be an even trade.",
        "Harley: Okay, wait a second. I... I... I... okay. I do have one more thing. This.",
        "Mallet: A piece of cardboard? Wow, slow down. This is really tantalizing.",
        "Harley: It's not just a piece of cardboard. Before Phillip was supposedly killed-- you know, when he was going off the deep end-- he had this big plan to remake Springfield in his own image. And he had this scale model built of the whole town.",
        "Mallet: Right. Is this what Alan was talking about when we were here before?",
        "Harley: Very good. Yes. Exactly. So this room, as Alan said, was decorated to look like the Spaulding boardroom.",
        "Mallet: Complete with a scale model?",
        "Harley: Exactly. So I came back here, and I was poking around. I turned over the garbage, and I found that little piece of cardboard. This is a piece of the model.",
        "Mallet: Are you sure?",
        "Harley: Well, no, I'm not sure, but yeah, it's a house. Look at it. It has to be... it's a piece of the model.",
        "Mallet: Okay, so if the model was here..",
        "Harley: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm- hmm...",
        "Mallet: Then that means at least a part of Alan's story is true.",
        "Harley: And if a part of Alan's story is true, maybe the whole story is true, and Phillip is alive, and he's still walking the earth. It's your turn. Tell me what you've got.",
        "Mallet: Okay. ( Clears throat ) This.",
        "Harley: You dusted for fingerprints. Ooh, that's good! Why didn't I think of that?",
        "Mallet: You would have, in due time. But what's really interesting is what I found. Nothing. Nothing. There is not a single fingerprint in this entire place. It's like the whole room has been washed down with bleach solution. Now, if that's true, why would someone do that unless...",
        "Harley: They had...",
        "Mallet and Harley: Something to hide.",
        "Mallet: Like the prints of a guy who's supposedly been dead for months.",
        "Harley: Oh, this is good. Okay, this is good. Okay, what do we do next? Let's think. The plan. Uh, uh, okay. We have to... we have to locate anybody who was associated with this building. People have seen somebody come in and out of here.",
        "Mallet: That's right.",
        "Harley: And we'd have to canvas the area for the homeless people, because homeless people always know what's going on in the neighborhood.",
        "Mallet: Hold it. Hold it, hold it, hold it. No, no, no. Hold it. No \"we.\" No \"we.\" I'll do the legwork. It's time for you to bow out.",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Mallet: Yes, yes. Please, for once in your life, just take this advice: Just drop it and go home. Let me handle it, okay? And just go back to what's-his- name.",
        "Harley: Gus.",
        "Mallet: Gus, Gus.",
        "Harley: ( Gasps ) Gus! Oh, my gosh. Gus was the one on the phone. I was supposed to meet him a half an hour ago for the wedding planner, and I would have remembered, too, if it hadn't been for you. Where's my model?",
        "Mallet: Here it is. I'm sorry.",
        "Harley: Come on, let's go.",
        "Mallet: No, you go. I'm going to stay here. I've got some more work to do.",
        "Harley: No way. This is my investigation. I call the shots.",
        "Mallet: No, it's not. It's my investigation now.",
        "Harley: Like hell it is. Come on. You have no rights over this thing.",
        "Mallet: I have every right. This is exactly what the good people of Springfield are paying me to do.",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Mallet: Did Frank not tell you this?",
        "Harley: Tell me what?",
        "Mallet: Well, I guess your brother has decided to finally forgive and forget. He cut me a break and offered me a job with the Springfield PD, and I said yes. So I guess from now on, you'll have to refer to me as Detective Mallet. So I guess that means move it along, my little civilian.",

        "Blake: You know what? I'm sure she's fine. Really. Unless, you know, Alan's story about Phillip being alive is true, and then all bets are off.",
        "Gus: Oh. We're not going to talk about that, remember?",
        "Blake: In front of Harley.",
        "Gus: Right, right. ( Cell phone rings ) That's her right now. Hello? Hello? Drago? Hold on a second. I can't. Give me a second. I can't hear you, Buddy. What? Uh-huh.",
        "Blake: Russ put up a brave front, but he couldn't help wonder: Where was his lady? Where is Marley? Is she with him, the man that once loved her, the man that Russ thought was out of her life forever until he resurfaced to save her? How could Russ compete with that? ( Gasps )",
        "Ross: Sorry.",
        "Blake: Ross.",
        "Ross: I haven't seen you talking into that thing since you wrote your last book. Are you writing another book? You are. What's it about?",

        "Dinah: No. She went on to the Beacon. I think Jeffrey is back. I was worried she was going to catch you.",
        "Edmund: No, no. Jeffrey's not back. It was me who called Cassie earlier. I was bugging Jeffrey's phone, and I inadvertently pressed speed-dial. Wouldn't you know it, he has her on number one? I didn't want her to see the number and think he was back, so... she didn't go over there, did she?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, to surprise him.",
        "Edmund: Ah. She just can't get enough of that man, can she? Oh, well. So, thank you so much for keeping her occupied for as long as you did. What did you do to pass the time?",
        "Dinah: Well, she developed some pictures from the baby shower, and we laughed and we talked, and it wasn't... it wasn't too bad. It actually was...",
        "Edmund: Was what? Was what, Dinah?",
        "Dinah: Oh.",

        "Ross: Are they okay with that?",
        "Blake: With what?",
        "Ross: With their private lives becoming public?",
        "Blake: Well, give them time. I mean, yes. They will be, you know, when they know about it.",
        "Ross: They don't know?",
        "Blake: No. Because I'm going to change everything. Everything's going to be fictionalized-- their names, the incidents. I'm going to beef up all the subplots. When I'm finished with this, they are not even going to recognize themselves, so there's no need to trouble them at all yet. All right?",
        "Ross: All right. I'm glad you're writing. I'm glad you're writing, because I know you love it. But do you really think that you have to beef up the drama? I mean, what happened to Gus and Harley, that's not dramatic enough?",
        "Blake: Well, you know writers. We have to put our stamp on things.",
        "Ross: Oh. Well, what elements are you thinking of adding?",
        "Blake: You're going to have to read the book, but I guarantee you there's going to be a lot of twists and turns, if I do say so myself.",

        "Cassie: When was the last time you spoke with Jeffrey, Miss...?",
        "Sonya: Sonya. It's been a while, but it never matters. Whenever I drop in on Jeffrey or he drops in on me, we just pick up right where we left off. It's like no time's ever passed at all.",
        "Cassie: Maybe you should pick up and get out.",
        "Sonya: So I guess you must be the girlfriend.",
        "Cassie: Good guess.",

        "Cassie: We spend a lot of time at my place. I have a farm, and he's great with my son.",
        "Sonya: The farm? Jeffrey and the children? ( Laughs ) I'd like to see that.",
        "Cassie: You know, before you pop in on an old flame uninvited, you may want to do your research first so you don't make a fool of yourself. If you have a problem leaving, I can call security.",
        "Sonya: No. I wouldn't want to be a bother.",
        "Cassie: No bother. I own the place.",

        "Edmund: No, I have to nip this one in the bud.",
