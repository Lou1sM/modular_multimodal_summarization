        "Gus: We're working security.",
        "Mallet: You don't think someone's going to take out the candidates for mayor-- careful, it could be dangerous. It could be a belt sander in there. Oh, look, books and pencils.",
        "Gus: What happened to Mr. Do it by the book? Huh?",
        "Mallet: That guy, Detective Book, he took the night off. Listen man, all we're doing is babysitting a bunch of bickering student council wannabe's.",
        "Gus: Sound check, sound check. Nice work idiot.",
        "Blake: I will remember what you said when your salary raises come across my desk for the police",

        "Jeffrey: \"Whoop\", make sure you use that word when we have the debate, ok?",
        "Blake: Just as long as you, make sure you do that little sniffling thing you do when you get nervous.",

        "Gus: Have a bunch of bad clams? Maybe it is the bed thing, huh?",
        "Harley: Wrong side, wrong bed. Dinah kicked him out of hers.",

        "Buzz: Something wrong with the burger?",
        "Dinah: Not hungry.",
        "Buzz: Well, you came to the right place.",
        "Dinah: You know, Buzz, imagine if your fianc\u00e9, the love of your life, the man that you've entrusted your heart and soul to, if you found out that he was secretly filing reports on you like a low-life criminal, do you think you'd want to eat?",
        "Buzz: It's a good burger. I take it that you and Mallet didn't make up after the engagement party? Okay, then.",
        "Dinah: A new post?",

        "Cassie: I do!",
        "Tammy: Okay. So tell me how Uncle Josh got into this again?",
        "Cassie: He was here when the power went out, I went out to the pond, he happened to go by the pond when I was in trouble so lucky for me he pulled me out before anything serious happened. End of story.",
        "Tammy: Mom, Mom, something serious did happen. You were... and he was...",

        "Josh: Where's my wife?",
        "Billy: Uh... you look--",

        "Josh: Oh...",
        "Billy: Josh, look.",
        "Josh: No, no, no. I just forgot the drill, that's all. I ask you questions about Reva and you don't answer me. That's the way it works, right. I missed this, I really have.",
        "Billy: She'll be home, soon.",
        "Josh: Thank you, I'll put that on my calendar.",
        "Billy: I hate seeing you like this. What can I do for you?",
        "Josh: Let's see... you could tell Reva that things have changed around here.",
        "Billy: I see. That you're going full ahead steam on the project.",
        "Billy: No, other things have changed around here, Billy.",
        "Billy: What things?",
        "Josh: Just tell Reva that she's been gone for a long time and sometimes things happen, things you don't really see coming. Actually, forget it. Forget it. You don't speak for Reva; I don't want you speaking for me. Good-bye. And by the way, next time you want to stop by and play \"20 questions,\" do me a favor and call first.",
        "Reva: I'm sorry that I made you do that.",
        "Billy: Let's go back inside. Wait...",

        "Tammy: But it's Uncle Josh.",
        "Cassie: Yes, we've established that, thank you. Okay, can we just eat the food in the fridge before it goes completely bad?",
        "Tammy: Well, do you know if he has feelings for you, too?",
        "Cassie: We've kind of talked about it.",
        "Tammy: You've talked about it?",
        "Cassie: If you don't want to know answer, don't ask the question.",

        "Cassie: I know.",
        "Tammy: Mom, this is crazy, Aunt Reva and Uncle Josh are like a legend, they're a super couple. If you mess with that...",
        "Cassie: Do you think I want to feel this way? I'm trying to fight it.",
        "Tammy: Well try harder. Seriously, what would have happened if I didn't come in here when I did, huh? This is so bad.",
        "Cassie: Okay, look, it didn't just happen overnight. Tammy, he was there for me when everything blew up with Edmund and then with Jeffrey and then I was there for him when he got back with Reva and I helped him restore Cross Creek for her.",
        "Tammy: And then you got in on the hospital project.",
        "Cassie: Right, which was supposed to be a family project, but Reva checked out and Billy's the only one who had any idea where she was and he's not talking so that leaves me and your Uncle Josh alone a lot and, I don't know, somewhere along the line something just happened between us.",
        "Tammy: Okay. Um, I'm trying not to judge you or anything but if you already knew how messed up this was then why wouldn't you just...",
        "Cassie: Why would I want him anyway? Huh, interesting question. You tell me.",
        "Tammy: No, that was different.",
        "Cassie: Really? How?",
        "Tammy: Mom, I didn't just go after my cousin, okay? Jonathan and I just... I couldn't help...",
        "Cassie: Uh-huh. You freaked out, right? And you tried to push it away and you tell yourself it's wrong and then you find yourself in his arms and suddenly it feels like it's not.",

        "Blake: All right. We all clear on the ground rules?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, we're clear.",
        "Blake: Okay. I think we can do this professionally.",
        "Jeffrey: Sure. You're not going to play that grieving widow card are you?",
        "Blake: It's not a card, Jeffrey, it's my life. Will you exploit your resemblance to a dearly departed leader to a tiny island nation?",
        "Jeffrey: And how will that help me?",
        "Blake: Well, it helped you with Cassie.",
        "Jeffrey: Don't even think of using that.",

        "Gus: You're telling me you haven't fixed up things with Dinah yet. What is the matter with you? This is what you. Do it worked-- kind of-- for me. Go to her, get on your hands and knees and beg for forgiveness. That's what you have to do.",
        "Harley: Even that doesn't always work.",
        "Mallet: I was just kind of hoping she would forgive me.",
        "Harley: You did publicly humiliate her at her own engagement party. It's kind of supposed to be her big day.",
        "Blake: Hey, Harley, we're ready for you.",
        "Harley: Great. They need know moderate the debate. Former CEO and all that. They couldn't agree on anybody else.",
        "Gus: Right. Well, good luck.",
        "Harley: Thanks. Sorry. You're the one who actually needs the luck. Not that you'd take any of our advice.",
        "Gus: Knock 'em dead. All right, so what are you going to do?",
        "Mallet: What? I'm working. We're working here.",
        "Gus: I'll hold down the fort for democracy's sake. You go. Go to your girl. Fix it up.",
        "Mallet: I'll only make it worse. Well, I guess I can't make it worse than it already is, right? All right, thanks, man.",
        "Gus: Things always get worse before they get worse.",

        "Buzz: I'm busy.",

        "Buzz: There are applications here. Um, Dinah, the knife, the... the knife.",
        "Dinah: If I had a nickel. If I had I nickel. Do it. Try it, crush it!",
        "Buzz: Oh, I get it, misery loves company.",
        "Dinah: That's exactly what I'm here.",
        "Buzz: You're misery and this is... I'm not going to let you destroy this computer.",
        "Dinah: I wish I knew who did this web site.",
        "Buzz: Some creep who's trying to push your buttons. Don't let it go to you.",
        "Dinah: You're right. You're always right.",
        "Buzz: It's a gift.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ashlee: It's too late. I'm already here and I'm going to get the job and move out and then maybe you'll start treating me like the adult that I am. What? Be reasonable, Doris? Yes, I called you Doris. Oh, shove it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: See that girl over there?",
        "Buzz: What?",
        "Dinah: That girl over there?",
        "Buzz: Yeah, why?",
        "Dinah: She's taking pictures of me with a camera.",
        "Buzz: No, she's not taking pictures.",
        "Dinah: You got a problem with me? You want to take a picture of me? Do you want a show? Is that what you want? You got your little video camera on there? Do you all want a show? I'll give you a show. I'll give you a show that tops all shows. I didn't grow up in a carnival for anything. Come on, baby, let's go! Let's get ready, everybody, because here it goes. Is this what you want? Whoo! Oh!",

        "Reva: I'm just tired from the traveling, Billy. Let's go to the hotel.",
        "Billy: This is a little more than fatigue. You're getting use to a whole new immune system, Jonathan's T-cells and you're little screwed up in the head.",
        "Reva: The head?",
        "Billy: Yeah, yeah. You have to learn that you can't do this without Josh from now on, okay?",
        "Reva: No. I'm just... I'm not ready to see him yet and I'm not ready for him to see me like this.",
        "Billy: Sweetheart, I want to wait to see if you understand if you're over your cancer, but I think that Josh has had it up to here with waiting. Did you hear what he said before?",
        "Reva: Hear what?",
        "Billy: Okay, let's just see if you get better, okay?",
        "Reva: I'm not going in.",

        "Cassie: You want some?",
        "Tammy: The thought of you and Josh together pretty much killed my appetite.",
        "Cassie: Come on. Don't be like that. Don't you think I feel badly enough. Don't you think I know how other people would see this?",
        "Tammy: Forget other people, Mom, I'm thinking about Aunt Reva. (Phone ringing)",
        "Cassie: Hello?",
        "Josh: Hi. I've got great news. How fast can you get over here?",
        "Cassie: Could you maybe tell me over the phone? It's kind of late.",
        "Josh: It's the best news the H.B. project has ever had.",
        "Cassie: It's about the project? Well, of course, I will be right there. It's about the project.",
        "Tammy: The hospital. Yeah, I heard.",
        "Cassie: So... I mean, you can come with me. It's really good news, whatever it is. Or, um, would that be too weird?",
        "Tammy: Mom, come on!",
        "Cassie: Tammy...",
        "Tammy: I've got to go to Cedar's for a follow-up anyway.",
        "Cassie: Maybe I should go with you. Josh will understand if I...",
        "Tammy: No. No, you go ahead.",
        "Cassie: Tammy, are we okay?",
        "Tammy: I'll talk to you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Come on, Buzz, what's the matter? Don't you know talent when you see it? You should charge a cover for this.",
        "Buzz: Honey, could you please get down?",
        "Dinah: No, honey, not until everybody sees it. Does everybody have their cell phones on with their cameras?",
        "Buzz: People are trying to eat.",
        "Dinah: Step up, folks! Step right up! You're going to behold convict bride! The convict bride! No bearded ladies or midgets here! No, folks, what you've got is a woman whose fianc\u00e9 would rather rat her out to the feds than even walk her down the aisle! That's right, folks!",
        "Ashlee: Is it always like this?",
        "Buzz: More than you think.",
        "Dinah: Bring in the balloons",
        "Ashlee: Cool. When can I start?",
        "Dinah: I love it come on, everybody! Snap phones and take a picture of me! Take a picture of me because springfield.com, which happens to be the hottest web site out now, that hasn't humiliated me enough this week. That's right, in fact, we need to keep that trashy web site in business. So come on, take pictures. Buzz!",
        "Buzz: What?",
        "Dinah: Hit the radio, honey.",

        "Harley: I'd like to welcome you all our first Springfield mayoral debate between our candidates, Assistant District Attorney Jeffrey O'Neill and our current first lady Blake Marler.

        "Blake: Thank you. Thank you to the citizens of Springfield for all of your encouragement and support. I will represent you because I am one of you. And I promise to continue the legacy of my late husband, Ross Marler. (Applause) I believe in good old-fashioned family values. Not as a political platform, but as a way of life. Thank you.

        "Harley: Thank you. Mr. O'Neill.",
        "Jeffrey: Thank you. Um... it's an honor to be here. While I haven't been a citizen of Springfield all that long, I have come to love this place and the people in it. Yes, I have ideas, new ideas, but I also respect the history of this wonderful town. A history of family and of honor and I think even Ms. Marler would have to agree that this town needs a mayor who can uphold the office with dignity and grace.",

        "Blake: Mr. O'Neill, are you implying only a man can do the job this difficult? (Laughter)",
        "Jeffrey: No, I'm just saying a job requires a man to keep his balance. (Laughter)",
        "Blake: I assure you that women can be very flexible. (Laughter)",
        "Jeffrey: I can assure you that I have particular skills that can get the job done. (Laughter)",
        "Blake: No one is arguing your skills, Mr. O'Neill. (Laughter)",
        "Jeffrey: I'm just saying, you know, that we should come together to... (laughter) ...Reach a common goal and that we should continue to cooperate. (Laughter)",

And I thought to myself for a minute maybe I shouldn't call Cassie and have her come over here for this, but then I thought wait a minute, wait a minute. I have dragged her into every lousy thing that has happened on this project. I mean, deadlines that weren't met and funding didn't come through. Then this great thing happens, what am I supposed to do, keep you out of the loop?",
