        "Danny: Thank you for letting me talk about our wedding. It was the best day \r\nof my life. ",
        "Michelle: No, you know, thank you for helping me know how special it really \r\nwas. ",
        "Waitress: Appetizer? ",
        "Dinah: Another version of perfect. That's what they used to call her, you \r\nknow? Miss perfect. Everybody used to say that, how perfect she was. Perfect \r\nlittle blondie. ",
        "Ross: What was that? ",
        "Cassie: Someone keeps crank calling me and asking for blondie. ",
        "Waitress: Sir? Sir? Is everything okay? ",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, everything is fine. With your blonde hair, I thought you \r\nwere... never mind, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. ",
        "Cassie: Here's a bit of etiquette I picked up when I was a princess: It's \r\nconsidered rude to hit on the wait staff-- at least before dinner's been served.\r\n",
        "Blake: Oh. Hey. Ross? ",
        "Ross: Hm? ",
        "Blake: I can't find harley anywhere, and gus is looking for her. I have a \r\nbad... hey. ",
        "Cassie: Blake... ",
        "Blake: Have you seen harley? ",
        "Cassie: I was hoping you'd seen her. I mean, the last time I saw her, she was \r\ndetermined to see gus before the ceremony. ",
        "Blake: Oh, that's great. That's just great. ",
        "Ross: Is edmund coming to this? ",
        "Cassie: He's on his way, i hope. He had some business to wrap up at the \r\nbeacon. Well, come on. More time before the ceremony means more time to drink.\r\n",
        "Blake: (Laughs) ",
        "Marina: I was worried about darci so we went back to the house to look for \r\nher, and i found that on the table. ",
        "Frank: Why were you worried about her? ",
        "Marina: Well, we were all helping harley get ready... ",
        "Frank: And what, honey? What? What happened? Please, tell me. ",
        "Marina: And darci walked in just as someone said that you were being \r\ninvestigated because of something in her past, and she acted like she knew about \r\nit and it was no big deal, but i sort of thought maybe it was a big deal. ",
        "\"You could lose your career because of me. You're better off without me.\" ",
        "Buzz: Frank? What? ",
        "Frank: Dad, she's gone. Darci's left town. ",
        "Gus: Hi. You look amazing. I've been looking all over this place for you and \r\nI thought... we need to talk before we take that walk down the aisle, you know? \r\nSo we can start our marriage off with complete and total honesty. ",
        "Harley: Save it. I know everything. ",
        "Alexandra: If there's any way ",
        "you could forgive me... ",
        "Harley: The camera doesn't lie. Unlike you. ",
        "Alexandra: Harley? Buzz. Thank heavens. Have you seen harley? Because I've \r\ngot to keep this wedding thing on track, you know. Otherwise, I'm sure... I've \r\nnever known a bride to ever be on time for a wedding-- the constant fussing and \r\neverything-- but at the same time, you've got to pull the plug sometimes, so...\r\n",
        "Buzz: Yes, you do. ",
        "Alexandra: Buzz? Are you okay? I mean, you seem a little grim for the father \r\nof the bride. ",
        "Buzz: The situation with frank, it keeps getting worse. ",
        "Alexandra: Why? Did something new happen? ",
        "Buzz: New information. ",
        "Alexandra: What kind of information? ",
        "Buzz: It seems that darci has left him. She found out that she was the reason \r\nthat internal affairs stepped up the probe. It was too much for her, so she took \r\noff. ",
        "Alexandra: Oh, no. ",
        "Buzz: The same day my daughter is supposed to be married, my son loses his \r\nfiancee. ",
        "Alexandra: Buzz, I'M... I'm so sorry. ",
        "Buzz: Are you? ",
        "Alexandra: Well, of course, i am. ",
        "Buzz: Do you know what I want to happen now? I want for my son to have his \r\nlife back. Now, how can I do that? How do I clear frank's good name? How do I \r\nget his job back and the woman he loves? How can I make all that happen? ",
        "Edmund: Where's my phone? Oh, that's right. Oh god! I'm sorry. Are you all \r\nright? ",
        "Dinah: Talk about a knight in shining armor. ",
        "Jeffrey: Come on, dinah. Pick it up. Pick it up. Yeah, it's o'neill. Did she \r\ncheck out of her suite at the san marco? All right, well, run it through \r\nimmigration, check all of her passports. I have a feeling that she tried to get \r\nto the states. ",
        "Olivia: What's going on? ",
        "Phillip: A wedding, as far as I know. ",
        "Olivia: Yeah, well, they're behind schedule, and I'm sensing a lot of \r\ntension. ",
        "Phillip: Yes. I'm feeling that, too. ",
        "Olivia: Have you seen harley? ",
        "Phillip: I have. But gus just went to find her. ",
        "Olivia: Oh, well, that can't be good. ",
        "Phillip: No, I think something's going on that we're all unaware of. ",
        "Olivia: You sure it's not just happy people? That's kind of foreign to us.\r\n",
        "Phillip: Yeah. ",
        "Olivia: That's all you're going to say is \"yeah\"? No witty comeback, no \r\nsarcastic reference to our ill-fated nuptials in the loony bin? It's not like \r\nyou to pass up an opportunity to hurt me. ",
        "Phillip: I guess I'm just not in the mood. ",
        "Olivia: I guess not. So what's wrong? ",
        "Phillip: Weddings. Here's to love. ",
        "Danny: What's taking so long? You want some champagne? ",
        "Michelle: Sure. ",
        "Danny: I'll go get us some. ",
        "Michelle: Hey. You got my message? ",
        "Tony: Um, what message? ",
        "Michelle: Oh. Oh... I needed to talk to you before. You know, all these \r\npeople here were coming up to me and telling me this day reminded them of mine \r\nand danny's wedding last year. I sort of lost it. ",
        "Tony: Well, you seem okay. ",
        "Michelle: Yeah. Yeah, danny said some things to me that helped. ",
        "Tony: Good. Good. I've got to go. So, I'll see you. ",
        "Michelle: Wait, if you didn't get my message, what are you doing here? ",
        "Tony: I, um.... well, I came to bring gus and harley a gift. ",
        "Michelle: I thought you weren't invited. Why are you getting them a gift? ",
        "Tony: Because I wanted to, michelle. Okay? I wanted to. So I've got to go.\r\n",
        "Michelle: Well, where's the gift, then? ",
        "Tony: I left it on the table for them. Listen, I've got a lot of things to \r\ndo, and quite honestly, I've got a date, so... ",
        "Michelle: Oh, a date. ",
        "Tony: That's right. ",
        "Michelle: Oh, sheryl? The naughty nurse? ",
        "Tony: Well, I didn't really get a chance to see how naughty she really was \r\nbecause you did interrupt me. Remember? ",
        "Michelle: You're going out with her again, though. ",
        "Tony: Have fun, michelle. ",
        "Danny: What's tony doing here? ",
        "Michelle: He... he brought a gift for the happy couple. ",
        "Danny: Oh. There you go. So, I need to ask you something. When we got here, \r\nyou didn't want to hear a word about our wedding, and then all of a sudden you \r\nwere interested. I'm not complaining, I just... ",
        "Michelle: What changed my mind? ",
        "Danny: Yeah. ",
        "Michelle: I guess I just felt that it was time. ",
        "Frank: She doesn't say where she's going. I have to find her. She has to know \r\nthat she's not responsible for what happened to me. I know who set me up. ",
        "Marina: Who? Who did this to you? ",
        "Gus: Can you wait a second please? ",
        "Harley: Wait for what? For you to ruin some more things? I don't think that's \r\npossible. ",
        "Gus: Well, I was going to tell you. ",
        "Harley: Liar! ",
        "Gus: Well, I'm not... I can't lie any more to you, okay? ",
        "Harley: No, just for a few months, right? Any more than that is beyond your \r\nlimit. ",
        "Gus: No, you listen to me because I'm not leaving this room until you do. ",
        "Harley: Fine. ",
        "Gus: Okay? ",
        "Harley: Then I will leave. ",
        "Gus: Look, I'm telling you. ",
        "Harley: Don't you... let go of me! Don't you touch me! ",
        "Gus: Please just let me explain. Please? Please? ",
        "Harley: Fine, I'll let you explain. And then I will explain to you why I will \r\nnever marry you. ",
        "Dinah: Thank you for catching me like this. ",
        "Edmund: Well, I wouldn't have had to catch you if I hadn't knocked you over. \r\nI'm sorry about that. ",
        "Dinah: Well, I wasn't looking where I was going. You look awfully familiar to \r\nme. Have we met before? ",
        "Edmund: I don't think so. Perhaps... well, my picture is in the paper \r\noccasionally. Edmund winslow. ",
        "Dinah: Right. Okay. Yes, you're a diplomat. ",
        "Edmund: Yes, exactly. Ambassador from san cristobel. ",
        "Dinah: Okay, then I probably did see your picture in the paper. Or maybe we \r\nwould have crossed paths at a fundraiser? ",
        "Edmund: Here in springfield? ",
        "Dinah: Most likely. And we've probably chatted for all of ten seconds. I \r\nmean, you know how those things are. ",
        "Edmund: (Laughs) ",
        "Dinah: But I wonder who could have introduced us? Maybe jeffrey o'neill, the \r\ndistrict attorney? ",
        "Edmund: Ah. You know jeffrey o'neill. ",
        "Dinah: Oh. Yeah. We go way back, before he came to springfield. Yeah, I know \r\nall his deepest and darkest, yeah. ",
        "Edmund: Really? Just how deep and just how dark? ",
        "Dinah: (Laughs) oh, boy. I was supposed to be somewhere. Yes. ",
        "Edmund: Right. ",
        "Dinah: Thank you. It was lovely meeting you. Maybe we'll run into each other \r\nagain sometime. ",
        "Edmund: Good. Good, I hope so. Sorry, I didn'T... ...catch your name. ",
        "Alexandra: Oh, I know what it's like to see your child in pain and feel \r\npowerless to help him. ",
        "Buzz: Maybe I can. Or someone else can. ",
        "Alexandra: Well, you can't just go grasping at straws, as tempting as that \r\nmay be. It may just be that this... that the situation is what it is. ",
        "Buzz: You say that now, but if it were your son, you'd hold on to hope. ",
        "Alexandra: Oh, I know. I know you want to believe, frank, you want to believe \r\nin him. I know. But, you know, there may just come a time when... when that's no \r\nlonger a possibility. ",
        "Buzz: Because? ",
        "Alexandra: Well, because the evidence just may become overwhelming. I mean, \r\nit doesn't make frank a bad person. I mean, good people do bad things all the \r\ntime, you know. ",
        "Buzz: That's what I hear. ",
        "Alexandra: Well, let's talk about this later. I've got to find harley. I've \r\ngot to keep this wedding on track. Otherwise I'll be accused of... ",
        "Buzz: No problem. I have responsibilities of my own. ",
        "Alexandra: Well, then, I'll see you later. ",
        "Ross: Alexandra, what's going on with the bride and groom? ",
        "Alexandra: I don't know. I'm going to find out. ",
        "Ross: Well, the guests are getting a little restless. ",
        "Buzz: Ross? Can I see you for a moment? Come on in. ",
        "Ross: Right now? ",
        "Buzz: I want to show you something. ",
        "Ross: What is it? ",
        "Buzz: I want you to look at this. ",
        "Ross: Um, buzz, I'll tell you what. Why don't I take it home and I'll look at \r\nit tonight? ",
        "Buzz: Look at it now. ",
        "Marina: Dad? Are you okay? ",
        "Reva: So, enjoying yourselves? ",
        "Danny: I think so. Yeah. Are we? ",
        "Michelle: We are now. ",
        "Josh: Did I miss something here? Did something happen? ",
        "Danny: Yeah. Something's going on between you two. What's up? ",
        "Michelle: Reva gave me some advice. ",
        "Josh: Oh, advice. That's a good thing. That's like chocolate, don't you \r\nthink? I mean, once you get started on it, you can't let go and you can't give \r\nit up. ",
        "Reva: (Laughs) ",
        "Michelle: She suggested that I be more open to things, and, you know, that's \r\nwhat I'm trying to do. ",
        "Reva: So you want to keep going on that track? ",
        "Michelle: Yeah, sure. ",
        "Reva: I have a television show, and we produce it live, and it creates a lot \r\nof crisis and controversy and catastrophe sometime. And I don't know, maybe \r\nyou'd like to come by and join me on a day, see if it might be something you're \r\ninterested in. ",
        "Michelle: In front of the camera or behind? ",
        "Reva: Behind for starters. I mean, i am the talent, and I'd like you to \r\nremember that, thank you. ",
        "Michelle: Okay. No, that I can deal with. ",
        "Reva: Okay. Well, why don't we go get another drink, and we'll talk about it?\r\n",
        "Danny: Thanks. ",
        "Olivia: Alan, what is the holdup? ",
        "Alan: Olivia, I'm sure everything is just fine. ",
        "Blake: Alan, alan, what is going on? I can't find harley, and now i can't \r\nfind gus or ross. ",
        "Alan: Blake, I'm sure everything is just fine. They're probably rewriting \r\ntheir vows for about the hundredth time. Don't you worry. I have everything \r\nunder control. Hey, excuse me, frank. I need to get inside, all right? Is there \r\nsomething I can do for you? ",
        "Frank: I think you've done more than enough already, alan. ",
        "Alan: Frank, I don't know what this is about, but we're about to have a \r\nwedding here, all right? So it can wait. ",
        "Frank: This is what this is all about. This is what you did to me. Did you \r\nreally think I wouldn't find out about it? ",
        "Gus: Listen to me. Yes, I lied to you. And from the second those words came \r\nout of my mouth, I've hated myself. And I swear to god that every minute of \r\nevery day I have known that I would have to tell you the truth, and I wanted to \r\ntell you, and I tried to tell you. And I would start to tell you, but I couldn't \r\nfind the right words or it would be the wrong time, or you would say something \r\nso beautiful to me, and I would think, \"I can't do this to her. I...\" and then \r\nI'd just hit the wall, you know? This morning, today, our wedding day. Now \r\nthere's a videotape. Great. And I say good. You watch that tape, okay? And then \r\nyou will be able to see how the whole thing went down, that alan really \r\npressured me hard. And he played the whole spaulding family card. And I... I \r\ncould have said no. I know it's not an exc... i should have said no. I should \r\nhave said no. But I just wanted us to move on with our life, you know? I wanted \r\nus to be married, and i just wanted you to be happy. I wanted us to be happy. \r\nBaby, listen to me. I made a mistake. I made a mistake, okay? And every single \r\ntime that you said that you trusted me or that you loved me or you told the \r\nuniverse that I was a great guy, I'm sorry. It killed me, because you mean \r\neverything to me. And I know that you're angry, and I know... and you have a \r\nright to be angry. And now there'S... I'm thinking there's this tape, and what \r\nif there wasn't? I could come down and explain it to you the way that I wanted \r\nto explain it to you. I... I'M... look, I lied to you, and I betrayed your \r\ntrust. And for that I am really sorry, and I will be for the rest of my life. \r\nBut the bottom line here is that I am in love with you. Now, we are moments away \r\nfrom being husband and wife. We are moments away from pledging our love together \r\nforever. So you've got to think about that, okay? You've got to think about that \r\nbefore you just go flying out of here and throwing the whole thing away. ",
        "Edmund: Coming up on ",
        "\"guiding light\"... ",
        "Phillip: Here. This is for you. ",
        "Olivia: What is it? ",
        "Phillip: Open it and find out. ",
        "Alan: Hey, frank... ",
        "Frank: Got your attention now, don't I, mr. Spaulding, huh? You and your \r\nsister lost big- time, and I am going to so make you pay for what you did to me \r\nand my family. ",
        "Alexandra: ...Know if there's ",
        "any way you can forgive me. ",
        "Gus: It's over, alexandra. ",
        "Look, I saw brad green pick up ",
        "the drugs... ",
        "Ross: This is unbelievable. ",
        "Buzz: I could have given it to o'neill, but I trust you. ",
        "Ross: I can't even begin to imagine the consequences of this. ",
        "Buzz: I know. ",
        "Ross: Buzz, I'm sorry. I know that you and alex... ",
        "Buzz: Forget about me and alex. I have. This probably means that she framed \r\nfrank, you know. Will he get his job back? ",
        "Ross: Yeah. I have to get on this right away. ",
        "Buzz: Yeah. You do what you've got to do. ",
        "Cassie: I've got to find blake and figure out what's going on with the \r\nceremony. ",
        "Jeffrey: The ceremony's going to start when it starts. Take it easy. Now, \r\nplease finish telling me what you were going to say. ",
        "Cassie: Why are you more obsessed with this fake princess cassie than I am?\r\n",
        "Jeffrey: I'm not obsessed with her, okay? I'M... what I'm obsessed with is \r\ndoing my job, and doing my job means following up on details, and I find it \r\nincredible that both you and edmund were at the same party as this woman, bid on \r\nthe same knife as... ",
        "Cassie: Dagger. It was a dagger. ",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, dagger, whatever. Tracked her back to her hotel room, laid in \r\nwait for her in her suite, and you never saw a glimpse of her face. ",
        "Cassie: Oh, I saw her. ",
        "Jeffrey: What? ",
        "Cassie: I'm sure I saw her a hundred times. I just didn't know it was her \r\nthat I was seeing. Why are you giving me such a hard time here? You're the \r\nexpert. And why is it that you told edmund that interpol was closing in on her \r\nand had her under their radar? ",
        "Jeffrey: I didn't want you to worry, that's all. In case she, you know, \r\nslipped through our fingers. ",
        "Cassie: Well, you know what? It looks like she slipped through both our \r\nfingers. (Phone rings) excuse me. Hello? ",
        "Edmund: Cassie, hi. I'm late. I'm sorry. I couldn't find my phone. I should \r\nbe there in a few minutes. ",
        "Cassie: Oh, don't worry about it. The ceremony hasn't even started yet. ",
        "Edmund: Well, weddings always run late. ",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Well, I don't know, I get the feeling something's wrong. ",
        "Edmund: Don't worry, cassie. It's a wedding. What could go wrong? ",
        "Cassie: Nothing, I guess. ",
        "Frank: Did you really think i couldn't figure this out? Huh, alan? ",
        "Alan: I don't know what you're talking about, frank. ",
        "Frank: You know, when I first started investigating this case, I wanted to \r\nsee if brad greene had an accomplice. So I focused on alexandra. And you know \r\nwhat happens? Some bogus file mysteriously appears in my briefcase without any \r\nfingerprints on it. ",
        "Alan: Oh, that's fascinating. ",
        "Frank: I'll tell you what's fascinating-- a million bucks was put into a \r\nswiss bank account with my name on it. A million bucks, alan. I don't know too \r\nmany people who have access to that kind of money, and even fewer who can afford \r\nto throw it away. ",
        "Alan: Congratulations, frank. You're obviously narrowing in on your suspect. \r\nNow, I have a wedding, if you'll excuse me. ",
        "Frank: Excuse me! Don't walk away from me when I'm talking to you. ",
        "Alan: Frank, have you been drinking again? You know, you need to address that \r\nproblem. ",
        "Frank: You know what your problem is, alan? It's that you think you don't \r\nhave to play by the same rules or face the consequences of your actions, like us \r\nlittle people. Well, you know what? That's all about to change, because I'm \r\ngoing to show you just how wrong you are. You are no better than anyone else.\r\n",
        "Alan: I'm better than you, frank, and your behavior has just proven it. Now \r\nget out of my way. ",
        "Frank: I told you not to walk away! Hey, I've got your attention now, don't \r\nI, mr. Spaulding, huh? ",
        "Buzz: Frank! ",
        "Frank: I can't wait to make you suffer. ",
        "Harley: Do you know what it cost for me to be here in this dress, in this \r\nhouse, on this day? ",
        "Gus: Of course, I do. ",
        "Harley: How could you do this to me? How could you, when you know what it \r\ncost for me to be here? Don't say anything. Don't bring up your family, because \r\nthis isn't about alex. It's not about alan. It's not about the drugs. It's not \r\neven about how you let them set up frank. ",
        "Gus: No, I didn'T. I tried to stop that... ",
        "Harley: I don't want to hear it! No more excuses, because this is about you \r\nand me. This is about how from the second you walked out of that wine cellar, \r\nyou lied to me. Every look, every touch, every kiss was a lie. I trusted you, \r\neven though there were these voices in my head screaming for me to get out of \r\nhere, I trusted you. And look where it got me. Look where it got my family. ",
        "Gus: Look where it got us, okay? It got us to our wedding day. Baby, listen \r\nto me. Go out and look at those people, okay? They're here for us. They're here \r\nbecause they know we love each other, because we belong together. ",
        "Harley: You call this love? This pounding in my head, this pain in my heart, \r\nagain, this is love? This need to scream and shred this dress into a million \r\npieces and hit you and hit you?! ",
        "Gus: Listen to me, okay? I want to read something to you. Please? ",
        "Harley: What are those, your vows? ",
        "Gus: Yeah, I... this was not easy for me to write. ",
        "Harley: Oh, I can imagine how hard it must be to stand in front of everyone \r\nin your life and lie. Difficult even for you. ",
        "Gus: What are you talking about? This is... I meant every single word that... \r\nand I still mean every single word that I wrote here. ",
        "Harley: Do you want to hear my vows? I have mine memorized. Do you want to \r\nhear them? I mean, since there won't be a wedding, I would like you to hear \r\nevery word I was going to say. I would like for them to be burned into your \r\nbrain long after I am gone from your life. ",
        "Frank: I'm going to make you pay for everything you did to me and my family.\r\n",
        "Buzz: Frank, frank, give me the gun. ",
        "Frank: What they've done to harley. ",
        "Buzz: Frank, it's okay. Just give me the gun, frank. Frank? ",
        "Alan: Frank, you're obviously a lunatic! Everyone, you're all witnesses. This \r\nman tried to kill me. ",
        "Frank: I wasn't going to hurt him. ",
        "Ross: Frank, I put you on probation. You are not allowed to carry a weapon.\r\n",
        "Buzz: He's been under a lot of pressure. ",
        "Jeffrey: What are you thinking about, frank? ",
        "Ross: Let it go. We'll question him later. ",
        "Buzz: We don't have to let anybody know this happened, do we? ",
        "Ross: Buzz, what are you talking about? Any number of witnesses here, and you \r\nknow that alan's going to want his justice. ",
        "Buzz: Justice? ",
        "Ross: Now, come with me. ",
        "Marina: I've got to go. ",
        "Shayne: I'm going with you. ",
        "Marina: You'd better not. Thanks. Dad? ",
        "Alan: I'm all right. ",
        "Phillip: You all right? ",
        "Alan: Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, fine. It's just... frank just snapped, that's \r\nall. I'll be fine. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to apologize for this bit of \r\nexcitement down here, but it is now over, and I want you all to help yourself to \r\nsome more champagne because the ceremony is about to begin. ",
        "Phillip: Where are you going? ",
        "Alan: I'm going to find... I'm going to find gus. ",
        "Olivia: Is he okay? ",
        "Phillip: He says he is. ",
        "Olivia: Well, you guys know how to throw a wedding, don't you? Though at this \r\nrate, I'm not sure it's going to happen. ",
        "Phillip: No, I think it's safe to say at this point that there's a problem. \r\nAh, well. Better to deal with it now than later down the road, when it's so much \r\nharder to undo the damage. ",
        "Olivia: I couldn't agree more. ",
        "Phillip: Harder, but not entirely impossible. Here. This is for you. ",
        "Olivia: What is it? ",
        "Phillip: Open it and find out. ",
        "Ross: I'll be right back. ",
        "Marina: Dad? Dad, are you okay? ",
        "Frank: I really screwed up tonight. ",
        "Marina: No. No, it'S... it's going to be okay. It's all going to be okay. ",
        "Frank: I've got to go. I've got to go. Do you want to come with me, or do you \r\nwant to stay here? ",
        "Marina: Well, what about the wedding? ",
        "Frank: Oh, honey, I don't think there's going to be a wedding. The kids, \r\nharley's kids, jude and zach. We've got to get them out of here. ",
        "Marina: Why? Dad, what is going on? ",
        "Frank: No, no, we just need to round up the kids and we need to go home. ",
        "Harley: \"Gus aitoro, this is a day most people thought they would never see. \r\nHarley cooper, in a frilly white dress, walking down the aisle on spaulding \r\nproperty, pledging her life and her faith to the man that she loves most in the \r\nwhole world. Before I met you, I was like a turtle, hunkered down in my shell, \r\nafraid to stick my neck out, to be vulnerable. But you wore me down. You kept \r\nloving me and loving me until finally all that fear disappeared, and I was able \r\nto love again and to trust again. As a cop, the most important person is your \r\npartner. I think that's the same in marriage. In both, you put your life in your \r\npartner's hands. So to my partner in work and in life, I say thank you, for \r\neverything you've become to my family, another father to my children, another \r\nson to my father, another brother to frank. Thank you for opening my heart \r\nagain. I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.\" Not bad, huh? ",
        "Gus: Baby, please don'T. ",
        "Harley: This is the end of us because of a lie. Because of one bad choice. \r\nYou chose your family over me, and now all the love and trust that we had is \r\ngone, like it never existed. Oh, look who's here: The official wedding planner. \r\nSince you are here, I'd like to make it official. The wedding is off. ",
        "Gus: Wait! ",
        "Cassie: Oh, my god, I can't believe what happened with frank. ",
        "Jeffrey: I guess he just, you know, cracked under the pressure. ",
        "Cassie: Well, alan can certainly push to that point. And frank, he's been \r\ngoing through so much. He's been trying to put on a brave face for harley. I \r\njust... guess life caught up with him. I really wish there was something I could \r\ndo to help him. ",
        "Jeffrey: Well, just, you know, give him some space, give him some time and \r\nhe'll pull it together. Some people have a hard time getting a grip on their \r\nemotions, that's all. ",
        "Jeffrey: May I see? ",
        "Very nice. ",
        "Dinah: I clean up good. ",
        "Just not good enough for you, ",
        "though. ",
        "Jeffrey: So don't tell me ",
        "you're holding a grudge because ",
        "I refused your advances ",
        "earlier. ",
        "Dinah: I'm just trying to ",
        "make the arrangement more ",
        "enjoyable. ",
        "Jeffrey: I don't need it to ",
        "be more enjoyable, okay? ",
        "I told you when I dragged you ",
        "out of that prison that this is ",
        "business and that we have a ",
        "deal. ",
        "In case you forgot, here's the ",
        "deal, okay? ",
        "You pretend to be cassie ",
        "winslow when I want you to be, ",
        "when I need you to be, and in ",
        "return, you get your freedom. ",
        "It's a short-term deal, and ",
        "there's no room for any ",
        "emotional attachments. ",
        "Dinah: There are several attachments, jeffrey. You should know that. ",
        "Alan: There you are, gus. Come on. We're about ready to start. Let's go. ",
        "Gus: It's not happening. She's gone. ",
        "Alan: What? ",
        "Gus: She knows. ",
        "Alan: About... about everything? ",
        "Gus: Yes, about everything, every single lie. Lie after lie. And it's because \r\nof you people. No, I'm not going to do that. Alexandra, she broke the law, \r\nbut... you just asked a favor, didn't you? And I said yes. So it was me. I have \r\nno one to blame but myself. ",
        "Alexandra: Oh, alan, where are you? I need you. ",
        "Olivia: What is this? ",
        "Phillip: Well, what's wrong? I thought that was what you wanted. ",
        "Olivia: A divorce? Yes, it's what I wanted, but you said... ",
        "Phillip: That I would make you suffer forever? Well, I tried. I enjoyed it \r\nfor a while, but, i don't know, the situation we have now, I hate it. So... ",
        "Olivia: It's a very generous settlement. ",
        "Phillip: What I'm most concerned with is the custody of emma. We'll share \r\nthat 50-50. If you have a problem with that, the deal is off. ",
        "Olivia: I don't have a problem with that. I don't know what to say. ",
        "Phillip: Nothing is probably best. I will still never forgive you for what \r\nyou did, and if you ever get the idea to try to pull anything again, don'T. Or I \r\nwill press those fraud charges against you so fast it'll make your head spin.\r\n",
        "Olivia: I understand. ",
        "Phillip: Okay. That's that. ",
        "Alexandra: Uh, excuse me? May I have your attention, please? I'm sure you are \r\nall wondering why the wedding hasn't started yet. Well, if you'll just give me a \r\nmoment, I'm sure I can get some answer for you. ",
        "Gus: I have the answer. There's not going to be a wedding today. ",
        "Alexandra: Oh, gus. Gus... ",
        "Gus: I want to thank you all for coming, and I'm really sorry. ",
        "Policeman: Which one, sir? ",
        "Ross: The one making the speech, alexandra spaulding. ",
        "Policeman: Alexandra spaulding? ",
        "Alexandra: Yes. ",
        "Policeman: You're under arrest, ma'am. ",
        "Alexandra: What? ",
        "Policeman: You have the right to remain silent... ",
        "Alexandra: Now, wait a minute. Wait just a minute. What is going on here? ",
        "Policeman: If you do not remain silent... ",
        "Ross: ...I want her prosecuted to the full extent of the law. ",
        "Alexandra: What do you mean? I'm not going to remain silent, because this is \r\nabsurd. There's something outrageous about this. ",
        "Ross: It's conspiracy to distribute illegal narcotics. ",
        "Alexandra: What? That's the charge? What are you... ",
        "jeffrey: You heard the mayor. Book her. ",
        "Alexandra: This is... no, there's something terrible, a terrible mistake. \r\nThere is a terrible mistake. Stop that. Alan, alan, will you do something? Oh, \r\nbuzz. Buzz, please understand. Will you stop that, for heaven's sakes? ",
        "Harley: (Sobbing) ",
        "Cassie: Next, on \"guiding ",
        "light\"... ",
        "Olivia: You did this. You helped phillip steal my baby. ",
