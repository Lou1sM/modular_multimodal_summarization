        "Dinah: \"Marler whacks another fianc\u00e9\" what? I'm dangerous, all right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: \"Rat's life-- detective flips on fianc\u00e9e.\" Oh, man. Flip. Oh, flip. You don't even know the meaning of the word yet, freak.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: (Gasps) There's only one solution. Just one solution.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: How did you get in here? Who are you, and what the hell do you want? (Knocks on door)",
        "Blake: Jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: Coming.",
        "Blake: God, can you believe this?",
        "Jeffrey: Unfortunately, I can.",
        "Blake: So... so, what are we going to do about this?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I'm going to have the pervert arrested and prosecuted to the full extent of the law.",
        "Blake: If you can find him, yeah.",
        "Jeffrey: I'll find him.",
        "Blake: And what do we do? I mean, what do we do in the meantime? I mean, what do I tell the press? That what, you know, somebody put my face on the body of one of your hookers or something?",
        "Jeffrey: No hookers, Blake.",
        "Blake: My point exactly. So there's only one way that we can save both of our campaigns.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, yeah, and that is?",
        "Blake: Go public about our relationship.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Click on my picture, please.",
        "Mallet: Buzz, I'm telling you don't, don't. It's trash. Trust me, you don't want to ruin your day.",
        "Buzz: No, I want to see who else's day is ruined. Would you please click on my photo?",
        "Mallet: Oh, boy.",
        "Buzz: Oh, please. \"Like father, like son.\" As if it wasn't complicated enough when it was private. Click on Olivia's picture.",
        "Coop: Why? Who cares, Dad? I mean, it's just a blog. It's not like anyone really looks at this stuff.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Wait, wait, wait, this way! I'll take him. I want it. I want it. Give it to me. Let me guess: \"Springfield Burns\"?",
        "Olivia: Somebody needs to infect that site with a nasty virus.",
        "Ava: Yeah, I know, it's kind of trashy, but, you know, I kind of like gossip. And anyway, any publicity is good publicity, right?",
        "Olivia: Is it you? Are you the one?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: I'll shut down the web site, Buzz. Then I want to shut down the peeping tom behind it.",
        "Buzz: Well, have any laws been broken?",
        "Mallet: Are you kidding me? We've got a clear case: Invasion of privacy, trespassing, publication of classified information.",
        "Coop: Got it. Mallet, I think that people can put whatever they want on a blog, though.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, unless you say it about me, because then it's personal. The site's going down before it wipes out somebody's life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: You wrote him that letter. I believe that he believed in me, and the feeling was mutual. Mutual. I trusted you, Mallet. But you didn't trust me. You know what? I don't care. I don't want to be walking down the aisle, Daddy, because you're not going to walk me down the aisle. You're never going to be able to walk me down the aisle. Because, you see, there's some girls that are meant to get married, and then there are other girls like me... (phone rings) What?",
        "Mallet: We need to talk. Where are you? It's kind of important. Just tell me where you are.",
        "Dinah: I'm in our room.",
        "Mallet: Okay, listen. Listen, just stay there, okay? And whatever you do, don't log onto Springfieldburns.com until I get there.",
        "Dinah: Hello? Nice, hang up on me. That's good. \"Springfield Burns.\" Hmm. And burns and burns. Want to see something that burns? Huh, Mallet? You want to see something that burns, other than our relationship? Huh? What do you think about this? So warm. Like your touch. But you get too close... ow! I loved you. I loved you so much, Mallet. More than anybody. I trusted you, too. But you didn't trust me. You followed me, recorded my every move. But I was supposed to be the love of your life. I was supposed to be your bride. No. No. You're not worth the secondhand smoke. No. Hmm. Yeah. Well, probably won't get back my deposit. Mallet, you get the memories.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Oh, gosh!",
        "Marina: Oh, buddy, where's the fire?",
        "Mallet: Oh, hey. Hey.",
        "Marina: Hi.",
        "Mallet: You're back.",
        "Marina: Yeah, I'm back. We made the bust, and it's good to be Marina Cooper again.",
        "Mallet: Good.",
        "Marina: Who wanted to be an undercover cop, anyway?",
        "Mallet: I don't know. It's not for everybody. But you know what you'd be really good at? You might be able to do this. I need a computer whiz that can trace a blog and identify the person behind it.",
        "Marina: Oh, what's the case, identity theft?",
        "Mallet: But can you handle it? Because I really, really, really... I've got to bust this person.",
        "Marina: Yeah, I mean, I think I can do it. I'm pretty good with computers. But, you know, I'm not half as good as Remy is.",
        "Mallet: Really? Okay, I'll put both of you on the case. Ask Frank to clear both your schedules, yeah?",
        "Marina: Yeah. What's the case?",
        "Mallet: It's... it's... I'll explain later. It's... I'll be in touch.",
        "Marina: Okay, well... I mean, is it \"Springfield Burns\"?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: I'm not quite sure what you mean by \"going public.\"",
        "Blake: Well, we have a good time together, right?",
        "Jeffrey: I would call it that, yes.",
        "Blake: It started out as one thing, and now it's something else.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, it started out in the back seat of a car.",
        "Blake: Front seat, actually. But it didn't end up there, did it? And, you know, it doesn't matter what it is. Maybe it's the campaign, right? Maybe it's all the battling each other, and that's a turn-on. But it doesn't really matter. Because why should we be embarrassed to say that we have a relationship?",
        "Jeffrey: Whoa, whoa. Okay. (Laughs uncomfortably) let's stop right there. Okay, look, we... we slept... we slept together a couple of times, and we had fun. But I don't think it's anything that either of us really want to be coming out with or anything like that.",
        "Blake: We don't have to come out, Jeffrey. It's all over the internet.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, so it's this week's scandal.",
        "Blake: So what are you proposing we do when people start to react to this?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, maybe they won't. You know, maybe no one will see it.",
        "Blake: It was broadcast to anyone who watched the debate.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, so some people will see it. Okay, then some people will talk. But, you know, rumors always abound in elections. Okay, that's just a fact. And I don't think we should lend this thing any more credit or stoke the fire by even commenting on it.",
        "Blake: Just pretend it didn't happen?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. We can do that, right?",
        "Blake: Right. It'll be easy.",
        "Jeffrey: Great.",
        "Blake: Great. See you on the campaign trail.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Is it just me, or does this place feel empty?",
        "Coop: No, it's not just you.",
        "Buzz: You know, Ava had all the ketchup bottles filled up, she'd be barking orders, she'd have me steered away from the coffee to the decaf. It's just... it's too darn quiet around here.",
        "Coop: Well, I'll tell her you said so.",
        "Buzz: No, don't. It's her first day working with Olivia. She, you know... it's a great opportunity.",
        "Coop: Maybe.",
        "Buzz: Maybe?",
        "Coop: Well, come on, Dad, all right? Let's be honest here. The only reason why Ava got the job in the first place is because of you-- you and Frank. It's Olivia's way of making a peace offering.",
        "Buzz: Well, you know, people get their shots in life all different kinds of ways. It's what you do with it that counts.",
        "Coop: You're right. You're right. I'm not lying about that. I mean, but I'm just saying, I hope Ava's shot doesn't come from Olivia shooting her.",
        "Buzz: Okay, they're not exactly pals, but they're more alike then they are different. You know, they both came up the hard way. And I know Olivia has a reputation, but she's... if you knew what she had to overcome to get there...",
        "Coop: You're really crazy about her, aren't you?",
        "Buzz: I'll tell you this much. She doesn't deserve all that trash that's written about her on the web site. I pray that she doesn't see it.",
        "Coop: Me, too. Especially not today, because Ava is literally in the line of fire.",
        "Buzz: And Olivia's got a temper.",
        "Coop: Well, so does Ava.",
        "Buzz: Why, they can coexist without killing each other.",
        "Coop: Are you sure?",
        "Buzz: I think maybe we better check on Ava.",
        "Coop: Good idea. Marina, it's all yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: You think I created \"Springfield Burns?\"",
        "Olivia: Right.",
        "Ava: Why would I do something like that?",
        "Olivia: Golly, I don't know, Ava. But whoever was behind this blog has some inside information, like the kind you pick up hanging out at a restaurant with Buzz and Frank.",
        "Ava: Oh, my gosh. Okay, fine. You're right. When I wasn't running around trying to get the orders right or refilling coffee cups, I've been snapping pictures and working surveillance.",
        "Olivia: Well, who was it that had a problem with how I was treating Buzz and Frank? And now you're airing your grievances in public.",
        "Ava: But I'm not doing anything!",
        "Olivia: You're getting your message out there, anonymously, but you're letting the whole damn world know what's going one.",
        "Ava: You know, if you want to fire me, fine. You know...",
        "Olivia: Okay, just wait. Wait.",
        "Ava: I don't even know how to work on the internet.",
        "Olivia: You lied on your resume?",
        "Ava: Oh, my God! This is crazy. You know what? To be honest with you, everything on that web site is true.",
        "Olivia: What?",
        "Ava: All the stuff about you and Buzz and Frank.",
        "Olivia: Oh, you are... you don't know when to quit, do... do you smell smoke?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: \"Relationship\"? Why the hell did I say that word? I'm just pathetic. I'm just absolutely pathetic. I'm a stupid, dumb... oh, Ross, I miss you. God, I really miss you. What's burning? Oh, my God. Fire! Oh, my God, fire! (Coughing) No, no, no. Fire, fire, fire. This way. Go out this way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: Hey! You're not supposed to cook in your room. You burn something? Hello? Never stay in anything less than a five-star hotel. Damn it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Ava's in there.",
        "Buzz: Look, look, look. I'll go inside and check on it. You wait and see if they come out.",
        "Coop: I'm going to come with you then.",
        "Buzz: No, come on, you just stay out of the confusion. They're probably just fine.",
        "Coop: Dad, I...",
        "Buzz: Look, stay here, please, all right? Why take the risk? (Fire truck sirens)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Did Fritz burn something in the kitchen again? Because I told him not to dip into the wine cellar when he's cooking. Hello? The line is dead.",
        "Ava: Okay, this doesn't smell like burnt prime rib. I think there's a fire.",
        "Olivia: No, no. The alarms would have gone off. Part of being in business means not panicking every time the cook gets drunk.",
        "Ava: Okay, it's getting worse.",
        "Olivia: No, it's fine. The kitchen just ventilates into the office. I'm sure it's fine outside.",
        "Ava: (Coughing)",
        "Olivia: Oh! Don't, don't! It's hot.",
        "Ava: Okay. Okay, all right, fine. You know what? We're in a middle of a fire here. We're going to have to do something about this. I've got to figure out another way to open the door. Maybe I can...",
        "Olivia: Well, what time is it?",
        "Ava: It's time to get out of here, okay?",
        "Olivia: No, Emma is supposed to be coming back here. I don't know where she is. I have to find her.",
        "Ava: How are you going to do that? The door is dead, the phone is dead... (arguing over each other)",
        "Olivia: Maybe there's a chance she's not even here. I don't have my cell! Do you have your cell phone?",
        "Ava: No! Will you help me with this? When are you going to help me with this? (Ava and Olivia scream)",
        "Olivia: Ava, are you okay?",
        "Ava: Help me. I'm pinned down.",
        "Olivia: Okay, okay.",
        "Ava: Get it off!",
        "Olivia: I can't move it. Wiggle. You've got to wiggle.",
        "Ava: I can't move. I'm pinned down. Come on, you can do it. Come on, just... just...",
        "Olivia: It's too heavy.",
        "Ava: You can do it.",
        "Olivia: Listen to me. You have to understand. I have to go find Emma. She's just a little girl. I can't save her.",
        "Ava: Don't!",
        "Olivia: Ava, I can't. I have to go. You have to understand.",
        "Ava: Don't leave me!",
        "Olivia: I'll send somebody. I'll send somebody back for you, I promise.",
        "Ava: No! Olivia, don't leave me! Don't leave me!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: (Coughing) Dinah! Dinah! Ow. She can't still be in there. Dinah, you in there? Stay low. Dinah, stay low! I'm coming in. Stay away from the door.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: (Laughing) I'm going to be needing those in a moment.",
        "Jeffrey: Skinny-dipping alone, madam?",
        "Dinah: Oh, come on. You were looking for a body, weren't you?",
        "Jeffrey: Certainly found one.",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Come on in. The water's fine.",
        "Jeffrey: It's a little too public for my taste, thank you very much. Besides, I'm running for office, remember?",
        "Dinah: Oh, come on. A skinny-dipping mayor is a fun mayor. You get my vote.",
        "Jeffrey: (Laughs) What are you doing in there anyway?",
        "Dinah: Oh, it was hot. I wanted to take a swim. It's lovely.",
        "Jeffrey: Not that hot tonight.",
        "Dinah: (Chuckles) I'm always hot. So did you get a good look?",
        "Jeffrey: Nothing I haven't seen before.",
        "Dinah: Aha! At least not in a while. Not since I hooked up with my tough fianc\u00e9e, who would probably beat you up.",
        "Jeffrey: Gonna beat me up?",
        "Dinah: That's right.",
        "Jeffrey: Don't tell me Mallet's made an honest woman of you, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: I don't know.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, he is still your fianc\u00e9e, isn't he?",
        "Dinah: I don't know.",
        "Jeffrey: You don't know, or you're not saying? So where is he, huh? Where is old Mallet tonight?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Dinah! Dinah! (Coughing) Dinah! Dinah! Dinah! Dinah! Oh, God, no. Dinah! Dinah! No! Dinah! Dinah! Oh, thank God she's not here. Dinah! (Loud crash)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Hey, Dad, wait up.",
        "Buzz: Would you wait outside?!",
        "Coop: Look, would you believe me if I told you I need to use the men's room? Look, I know what you're trying to do here. I know you're trying to protect me. But I'm an adult. I...",
        "Buzz: If there's somebody in here, I'll get them. Ava, Olivia... forget it, just go outside. Call Frank.",
        "Coop: I can't. No. No, no. Look at this place, it's huge. There's no way...",
        "Buzz: Damn it, would you go!",
        "Coop: No! Not without Ava, all right?",
        "Blake: Hey, hey, hey! You've got to turn around. The fire is spreading in that direction. You've got to go this way.",
        "Buzz: You see anybody back there?",
        "Coop: Ava's down there.",
        "Blake: You can't see anything. You can't even breathe. You've got to get the exit this way. Come on.",
        "Buzz: All right. I'm right behind you.",
        "Blake: Come on!",
        "Buzz: Okay!",
        "Coop: You go this way, I'll go this way. Please, we have to split up.",
        "Buzz: Look, I've dealt with fires. You haven't.",
        "Coop: I know that. I know that, Pop. Please, but look at me. I'm younger, all right? I haven't had a heart attack, and I'm not taking no on this. Please, go this way. I'll go this way.",
        "Buzz: Call me if you need me.",
        "Coop: I will. I always need you. (Coughs)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: (Coughing) No! Help me! My baby's upstairs! Somebody help me!",
        "Buzz: Olivia, is that you?",
        "Olivia: Buzz! Buzz! The exit upstairs, it's blocked, and the door is locked. I can't get out.",
        "Buzz: I'm here. I'm going to get you out of there.",
        "Olivia: No. Go. Emma's upstairs. Just get her and get out of the building.",
        "Buzz: Emma's in the parking lot with the nanny. She's fine. It's you we've got to worry about.",
        "Olivia: Are you sure you saw her?",
        "Buzz: I saw her, yes. I'm not leaving here without her mother. Now, just sit down and do your nails or something.",
        "Olivia: (Crying) I love you, Buzz.",
        "Buzz: Are there keys inside?",
        "Olivia: No, nowhere close.",
        "Buzz: Okay, well, I'm going to have to bash it down.",
        "Olivia: How? It's steel.",
        "Buzz: Well, so am I. Okay, now, get down, cover your face, cover your nose and your mouth, okay?",
        "Olivia: (Coughs) Okay.",
        "Buzz: I'll get you out of there. I'm going to get you back to Emma before it's bedtime, somehow.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Help me, somebody! (Sobs) Help me, I'm stuck. Help me! (Crying) Please, God. Please, please, please, just one call. (Screams)",
        "Alan-Michael: Ow!",
        "Ava: Is anybody there?",
        "Alan-Michael: You should really switch to my cell phone company. Unlimited calling, and the free phones are twice as tough as this. We keep meeting in the strangest places. Don't take this the wrong way. I preferred the shower. I'm going to get you out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Saw your case file on that web site. You know the file that Mallet was keeping on you for the feds?",
        "Dinah: Oh, right. Wasn't that the same one you were on? Your sweet pink cheeks. The one with Blake having her hands all over you. Yeah, that was nice.",
        "Jeffrey: Hey, hey, hey. Not easy being targeted, is it?",
        "Dinah: No.",
        "Jeffrey: But in your case, who knows? The truth might just set you free.",
        "Dinah: You know, not really interested in being analyzed while you're trying to check up all of my business.",
        "Jeffrey: (Laughs) You always did have a high opinion of yourself, even when you're treading water.",
        "Dinah: (Laughs) Well, I guess a true gentleman would avert his eyes. But you've never really been a true gentleman, have you, Jeffrey?",
        "Jeffrey: You know, I wouldn't go and try to challenge me at this moment, you see, because I'm holding all the cards-- or should I say \"clothes.\" Yeah, because I might just get angry and have to stroll away, and then you'd have to make a walk of shame through the hotel lobby.",
        "Dinah: Oh, no. You wouldn't do that. You wouldn't do that. Come back here. You wouldn't... get back here! I'm sorry. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. It's getting cold in here, and I'd like to have my clothes back, thank you very much.",
        "Jeffrey: Well... okay.",
        "Dinah: (Laughs) Ah! Ah! Please? Come on. Jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: All right. You put it that way, so nicely. Here, I'll help you out.",
        "Dinah: Uh, uh, uh.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay.",
        "Dinah: Thank you. (Cackling)",
        "Jeffrey: This is my favorite suit.",
        "Dinah: I think it looks pretty darn good on you. It looks pretty clingy.",
        "Jeffrey: You think so?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Yeah.",

        "(Mallet coughing)",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Why did you really come in here?",
        "Dinah: Because I wanted to wash it all away.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh yeah?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, and not care.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, washing it away and not caring can sometimes be very freeing.",
        "Dinah: You think? What?",
        "Jeffrey: Smoke.",
        "Dinah: What are you talking about?",
        "Jeffrey: The whole sky is lit up. I think the Beacon's on fire.",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Jeffrey: Here. Get your clothes and get dressed, quick.",
        "Dinah: I thought I... I thought it...",

        "Bellhop: I'm okay.",
        "Blake: Don't talk, don't talk.",
        "EMS worker: Is anybody burned?",
        "Blake: I don't know. I was on my way out, and I saw this man was trapped and I couldn't leave him. And I'm going to go in and save somebody else.",
        "EMS worker: No, no, no, no. Sit. Let us have a look at you, please.",

        "Anchorwoman: And you went back inside?",
        "Blake: I didn't think we were going to make it. I really didn't. But as my late husband, Ross, always said, I'm great in a crisis.",

        "Alan-Michael: Right. It was supposed to be Coop busting down the door with one hand and flying you off to paradise. Well, sorry to disappoint, but you're in no position to be choosy right now. It won't move.",
        "Ava: Wait! No, no. Where are you going? Don't leave me, please. I know you would...",
        "Alan-Michael: Thought I'd ditch you? Yeah. Well, the thought crossed my mind. Listen, there are easier ways to get attention, especially for a girl as beautiful as you.",
        "Ava: Oh, you are not flirting me while I'm dying in a fire.",
        "Alan-Michael: Listen to me. You are not dying. Know why? Because I'm not leaving until you're out, and I'm not dying. You got it?",
