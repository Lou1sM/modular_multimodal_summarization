        "Beth: You're afraid of being . >Sebuu never really friends with harley so why are you trying to help us?",
        "Beth: Because it's the right thing to do?",

        "Olivia: Where have you taken my daughter?",
        "Phillip: Well, that's not important, because as you can so clearly see through the miracle of video conferencing, it's practically possible for you to be right here with us. Isn't that right, sweetheart? Isn't that right? Do you want to say anything to mommy?",
        "Olivia: You can't just take her any time you want to, phillip.",
        "Phillip: Oh, I think you need to reread the fine print in our divorce agreement.",
        "Olivia: Like I said, you can't just take her. We never discussed any of this. I don't know where you are, how long you'll be gone.",
        "Phillip: That's right. You don'T.",
        "Harley: Oh, blake. Do you know what the worst part is? I haven't even told the boys. How do I do that? What do I say?",
        "Blake: You'll tell them something. You will. In the meantime, they're great. They had a great time at our house last night, and my mother took them all out to the beach today, so...",
        "Harley: Well, I'm glad they're having a fun day, because when they get back, i get to tell them that mommy messed up again. We're not marrying gus, and that life that they were so excited about is gone forever.",
        "Blake: You're wrong, okay? Mommy did not mess up again. Your kids don't need to hear that message. Stop talking like that, okay?",
        "Harley: Okay.",
        "Blake: Oh, what, okay? You're going to agree with me that easily?",
        "Harley: I'll just beat myself up later in private.",
        "Blake: How about you don't beat yourself up at all. Look, gus lied to you for a really dumb reason. How were you to know that that was coming?",
        "Harley: Because he's a spaulding. It's in his genes. He's just like the rest of them.",
        "Blake: Could I just point something out to you? You didn't know that gus was alan son when you got together with him.",
        "Harley: Whatever. Let me ask you this: If there was no ross, okay? There's no ross, ross has never been born. Do you get involved with another spauld do you? Say yes or no.",
        "Blake: What do you think?",
        "Harley: No, I don't want to hear \"what do you think,\" okay? We've both had equally bad times with this spaulding family, and I want to know, would you get involved with a spaulding, yes or no. Just say it.",
        "Blake: No, I would never get involved with a spaulding guy... arley: Exactly.",
        "Blake: But gus...",
        "Harley: Thank you very much, mrs. Marler, you have just made my point.",
        "Blake: Okay, would you just stop?",
        "Harley: What am I going to tell my boys?",
        "Blake: They're tough. You know kids. They can handle things.",
        "Harley: I hate this.",
        "Frank: Did a darci matthews check into this hotel?",
        "Clerk: I'm sorry, but I can't give out that information.",
        "Frank: That's okay, I'm the chief of police.",
        "Clerk: I know who you are, but I'm still going to need to see a badge.",
        "Frank: Is your boss here? Cassie winslow?",
        "Clerk: Mrs. Winslow isn't here right now. Perhaps you could come back.",
        "Frank: Perhaps you could...",
        "Ross: I just came from the police station. Not a good day for the coopers.Blake: Frank?",
        "Ross: Yeah. First his job and now darci's ne.",
        "Harley: Hey. You saw frank?",
        "Ross: Yes, I did. He's not in good shape.",
        "Harley: Is alan pressing charges?",
        "Ross: Well, strangely, not yet, but he made it clear what he wants.",
        "Harley: I can imagine what he wants. He wants you to fire frank.",
        "Blake: Oh, you're not going to fire frank, are you?",
        "Ross: Listen, you guys, this is ongoing. I shouldn't be discussing it.",
        "Harley: It's all right. I understand, really. Will you call me when holly gets back with the kids, please?",
        "Blake: I will bring them over.",
        "Harley: I did come here to work, actually.",
        "Ross: Harley, you take care.",
        "Harley: Thanks.",
        "Blake: Oh, wow. I need a hug.",
        "Ross: Yeah, I could use one, too.",
        "Blake: Oh, ross. I'm so glad we have each other. No more lies between us. It sure did take us a while to learn our lesson. I mean, I know it did, me. Actually, you, too. Just the worst way to kill a relationship.",
        "Frank: I am going to advise you to stay completely away from me, because I am a man who's got absolutely nothing to lose right now.",
        "Gus: I was looking for cassie, frank.",
        "Frank: Well, you know what? She's not here. And darci's not here, either. Do you know why? Because she left town, thanks to your family.",
        "Gus: I'm sorry about that, if your girl left you. If there's anything I can do, frank, just let me know, okay?",
        "Frank: I think you've done more than enough.",
        "Gus: Frank? For what it's worth, I thought i was doing right by everybody.",
        "Frank: Spoken like a true spaulding. Now, you are so lucky you're not in jail with your aunt right now.",
        "Buzz: I thought you were better than the rest of them. What happened to you?",
        "Alexandra: I'm the same person you danced with the other night, the same person you wouldn't let walk away from you.",
        "Buzz: I defended you. Why? Tell me why. Why did you do it? Alexandrai t know. I don't know. I don't know. It happened.",
        "Buzz: Well, there's an explanation.",
        "Alexandra: I don't know. I mean, I think it all started, I just wanted to get back here. I knew I had to make some sort of splash, so that alan could think I was somebody...",
        "Buzz: Well...",
        "Alexandra: ...Be somebody worthy. (Ironic applause)",
        "Buzz: Congratulations. Are bo. You have a number to prove it.",
        "Frank: You lied to someone who was letting drugs hit the streets.",
        "Gus: No, I cut the drug pipeline off, frank.",
        "Frank: You were going to let her walk away. You did everything you could to keep me away from her.",
        "Gus: I hated th. Fnkt you 't s you didn't say one word when they took my badge away. When ross sent me home in disgrace.",
        "Gus: I hated that for you, frank. Okay? So much so that I went to go see salerno the morning of my own wedding to clear your name.",
        "Frank: Didn't you think it would have been a lot easier just to tell the truth? No, of course not.Usat tes ganS. And you vether",
        "Alexandra: See, most of my life, I was second to alan. Our father, brandon, made sure of that. Alan was the one to carry on the family tradition into adulthood.",
        "Buzz: So selling drugs was a grownup way to get on top?",
        "Alexandra: Come on. I didn't know anything about that. Brad made promises.He wiant. I gave him power, I gave him freedom. It was too late by the time i found out any drugs were involved.",
        "Buzz: I don't believe you. You could have done something.",
        "Alexandra: And don't you think I tell myself that every day?",
        "Gus: I could have stopped it, frank, but the lies, they got too out of control.",
        "Frank: The point is that you didn't stop it.",
        "Gus: I never actually had proof that alexandra set you up, okay?",
        "Frank: You're a liar.",
        "Gus: Frank. Frank! Frank! I wanted to clear your name. Okay? I never wanted to hurt you or harley or anybody else, and that's the truth.",
        "Frank: Well, look here we are. I lost my job. I lost my girl.U mpte desoyedha lif dad I think you caused some serious hurt.",
        "Alexandra: So these people threatened to hurt everyone i loved if I turned brad in. Asea wthemob. Was if",
        ">Uzz: Pd of soell. You enjoyed the spoils of those games.",
        "Alexandra: I suppose I did. Yeah. Part of the time I spent pretending it wasn't there, and the other part I spent trying to think of some way I could stop it, and... I made such mistakes. Mistakes...",
        "Buzz: Mistakes?",
        "Alexandra: Can you understand? Can you understand? You can make one mistake and it gets you in deeper and deeper and deeper, until you don't really know who you are.",
        "Gus: Frank. Frank! Look, I would do anything i could to take that lie back and just come clean with harley from the minute I got out of that wine cellar. I would.",
        "Frank: Don't you think it's a little late for that?",
        "Gus: Yes. Yes. But I'm going to do whatever i can to make up for it.",
        "Frank: I saw that look on my sister's face when she sou pe. There are some things in life you never forget, and some things you never forgive.",
        "Alexandra: Can you find any way to forgive me?",
        "Buzz: I forgive you.",
        "Harley: I will never, ever forgive you. Coming up on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Alexandra: I really have nothing to lose, do I?",
        "Ross: What are you saying?",
        "Alexandra: I want to make a deal.",
        "Zach: Where's gus?",
        "Harley: Gus isn't here.",
        "Olivia: You are a sick monster.",
        "Phillip: Watch your tone. There are babies present.",
        "Olivia: I thought we were done with these mind games, phillip. You're not going to keep me from my daughter. Do you hear me?",
        "Phillip: Olivia, relax. Keeping a child away from their parent is more your thing. That's not what I'm doing.",
        "Olivia: Oh, god. That line is so old. So you really are on vacation?",
        "Phillip: Yes. We're really on vacation. Gus offered me his and harley's honeymoon bungalow. It was sort of a spur-of-the- moment thing. Such a shame. They would have had a wonderful time here. I guess I probably should have awakened you.",
        "Olivia: Well, then you wouldn't have gotten to see me sweat, would you?",
        "Phillip: And you know, speaking of sweating, I think i could use a dip in the pool. Don't worry, I'm keeping emma out of the sun.",
        "Olivia: When are you coming back?",
        "Phillip: Can't hear you. You're breaking up. Say good-bye to mommy.",
        "Olivia: Enjoy your vacation while it lasts, daddy, because you have just made a huge mistake. (Knocking at door)",
        "Marina: I know you're there. (Knocking continues) I can hear you. You never called me back.",
        "Harley: Hey.",
        "Marina: Hi.",
        "Harley: You know what? I really don't feel like talking. It's a little early for ice cream, isn't it?",
        "Marina: Rocky road. Get it?",
        "Harley: (Laughs) okay. I'll get us a couple of spoons.",
        "Marina: Hold on. Hold on. I saved the best for last.",
        "Harley: There's more?",
        "Marina: Oh, yeah.",
        "Harley: You want to play darts?",
        "Marina: This is no ordinary dart board. Alex for 500?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, buzz, i promise I'll find some way to make this up to you.",
        "Buzz: I forgive you. I forgive you for being caught up with brad green. Maybe you were trapped. I can't judge. I've done too many stupid things in my time.",
        "Alexandra: Thank you.",
        "Buzz: But there is one thing I can never forgive. You hurt my kids. No one hurts my kids.",
        "Alexandra: I'm so sorry.",
        "Buzz: I don't believe you. I don't think you are. I think you'd do it again if you had to.",
        "Alexandra: No.",
        "Buzz: How would you justify it? Would you say to yourself, \"it's your family, not mine.\"",
        "Alexandra: You know what? Maybe I did.",
        "Buzz: There are no excuses. There are none. You ruined any chance my daughter hughter had for happiness, on her wedding day. And frank? You stripped him of everything-- his job, his reputation, the woman he loves. You don't know what those kids had to sacrifice to get wherethey are today. They were knocked down all their lives. They only had each other to hang onto. But they kept on getting up. They got up. And they made it, and turned themselves into something, you know, better than anyone. And just when it looked like no one else could ever knock them down again, you came blowing in like a tornado and flattened them. You took their lives and...",
        "Alexandra: No. Your life. I hurt you.",
        "Buzz: This isn't about me. This isn't about me.",
        "Alexandra: Yes, it is. It is. It does involve you, because you're trying to be strong. I can see that. You're going to defend them, you know, but what kills me is i hurt you.",
        "Buzz: I loved you. You came into my life when i thought I'd used up all my second chances. I guess I had.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, please. Please don'T... don'T... don'T... don'T. Please just don't talk like there's no chance at all for us. Please. I mean, tell me what I can do to make this up to you. Tell me. You tell me how I can make it right.",
        "Buzz: Let frank off the hook. Confess to setting him up. Give him his life back.",
        "Alexandra: Well, if i confess, well, I could go to prison for a very long time.",
        "Buzz: Yeah.",
        "Alexandra: Yeah. Please, please don't leave like this.",
        "Blake: You're so tense.",
        "Ross: Tell me again, would you? Why did I want this job?",
        "Blake: To help make every springfielder's life more rewarding and prosperous.",
        "Ross: I said that, huh?",
        "Blake: Something like that, yeah.",
        "Ross: Well, that's certainly not what I did today.",
        "Blake: Well, you knew it wouldn't be easy.",
        "Ross: Yeah, I know, but frank has been such a good friend for so long, I hate taking a hard line with him.",
        "Blake: I know, but you didn't have any other choice.",
        "Ross: Yeah, but blake, he lost his fiancee, the woman he loves. If I had ever lost you, i wouldn't stop until you were back home.",
        "Blake: Well, you're not going to lose me.",
        "Ross: I should have been mayor of oakdale. I don't know anybody there.",
        "Blake: First rule of politics: You can't help everyone.",
        "Ross: I know that, but think of all the people that I know who are suffering right now. I mean, harley, frank, buzz, dinah.",
        "Blake: Dinah?",
        "Ross: Yeah. I've just been thinking about her lately.",
        "Blake: Oh? Oh, well, I mean, naturally. I mean, she's your daughter and all, but why now?",
        "Ross: No particular reason. We were just talking about helping people and I've been wanting to help her for quite some time now.",
        "Blake: Have you heard from dinah? (Cell phone rings)",
        "Ross: I think I have to take this. It's the station. Ross marler. Well, so what... well, tell ms. Spaulding to have her attorney go through the proper channels, would you? Why can'T... never mind. I'll be right there.",
        "Blake: The dragon lady want to see you?",
        "Ross: Uh, no. Dragon lady demands to see me. Bye.",
        "Blake: Bye.",
        "Gus: I'm not going to give up, frank. I love your sister. I guess we could stand here all day, right? It's not going to make much of a difference.",
        "Frank: You're right about that.",
        "Gus: Well, hopefully harley will see it a different way.",
        "Frank: Don't count on it. (Cell phone rings) cooper here. Did you hear from her? What do you mean, you can't help me? Of course you can'T.",
        "Gus: I could help you, frank.",
        "Frank: We're finished.",
        "Gus: Listen to me. This is about darci. I have... you know, I have a lot of friends at the bureau. I can help get your girl home. And I don't know, maybe you could help me talk to your sister.",
        "Frank: (Laughs bitterly) of course your help would come with strings. If harley sees you, she's going to come out swinging. Unless you want to make things worse, do her a favor: Stay away.",
        "Marina: (Laughs)",
        "Harley: This actually feels pretty good. It's better than burying my face in the pillows.",
        "Marina: So you want to play again?",
        "Harley: Um, I don't think so.",
        "Marina: How about some more ice cream?",
        "Harley: You know what? I'm going to stick the ice cream in the freezer before it melts all over the place. But thank you.",
        "Marina: Sure. (Knock at door) want me to get it?",
        "Harley: Um... no, I'll get it.",
        "Buzz: Fresh from the oven. Not really. Honey.",
        "Harley: How are you?",
        "Buzz: I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be?",
        "Harley: Right. Me, too.",
        "Buzz: Did you impale them all or did you leave a couple spauldings for me?",
        "Harley: I should have known.",
        "Buzz: It wasn't my idea. That was too evil for me.",
        "Marina: Hey, I don't mind being the evil one in the family.",
        "Buzz: Of course, I did lend them to her, though. Anybody want to take on the champ?",
        "Harley: I don't know.",
        "Marina: I think aunt harley wants to be alone right now.",
        "Buzz: Oh, come on. I have my favorite spoon, my lucky dart and my two best girls. (Knock at door)",
        "Frank: Somebody order a pizza?",
        "Harley: I thought you'd never get here.",
        "Frank: What, and miss all these happy faces?",
        "Harley: You know what, you guys? I...",
        "Buzz: Don't, don'T.",
        "Marina: No, please don'T.",
        "Harley: (Sobs) okay, that's it. Let's eat.",
        "Frank: Oh, great. (Laughter) oh, here we go.",
        "Alan: Olivia, it's customary to dress for breakfast here at the house.",
        "Olivia: What's the matter, alan? Temptation too much for you?",
        "Alan: Only the temptation to inject you from the premises.",
        "Olivia: You can look all you want, you know. I'm a free woman.",
        "Alan: What do you mean you're a free woman?",
        "Olivia: I got my divorce papers. Phillip gave them to me at the wedding.",
        "Alan: Well, well good for phillip. I was wondering what took him so long. When will you be leaving the house?",
        "Olivia: I don't know. We'll see.",
        "Alan: What could possibly detain you?",
        "Olivia: I have to find a place to live. Something appropriate for emma.",
        "Alan: Well, I'll be happy to give you the names of some brokers that I know.",
        "Olivia: That'll be lovely of you. Make a list.",
        "Alan: I'll be happy to.",
        "Olivia: Oh, buy the way, have you seen alex since she's been in jail? Because I just want you to give her my love when you do see her.",
        "Buzz: Get her. Come on, alex.",
        "Harley: Look at you enjoying this. I thought for sure you would take the high road.",
        "Frank: I see. And not be here for you? You've got to be kidding me. Besides marina and I have been kicking your butt at darts. So...",
        "Harley: Ah-huh.",
        "Frank: And I do think however that...",
        "Harley: See here comes the high road. (Laughter)",
        "Frank: There's no high road. I just think with, you know, with zach and jude around that maybe this might be a little too mean spirited.",
        "Marina: I'm on it, chief. I mean, dad.",
        "Buzz: It's okay. He's going to be reinstated.",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, what i want to be doing is finding darci actually.",
        "Harley: I want to help you.",
        "Frank: Really? You've got too much on your plate right now, sweetie.",
        "Harley: Frank, it's my turn to help you. (Knock at the door)",
        "Blake: Hey.",
        "Zach: Hello, mommy.",
        "Harley: What's up? Did you guys have fun at the beach? Clarissa tore down my sand castle.",
        "Harley: She did.",
        "Blake: Yeah, well, you know bitterness sets in when you're out numbered by boys. (Car horn honks)",
        "Blake: Hey, kevin, stop that! Or is that jason?",
        "Harley: Blake, they're not identical. They don't even look alike.",
        "Blake: I know. I think I might need glasses. Hey, I call you later, okay. All right.",
        "Frank: Thank you, blake.",
        "Blake: Bye.",
        "Frank: Who wants ice cream?",
        "Zach: Me. (Laughter)",
        "Frank: All right, get over here. Get over here.",
        "Harley: Wait, wait. Wait. Before we have ice cream, I want you to meet me in here.",
        "Frank: Zach, sit by your uncle frank here. Come here. I want you right here, big man.",
        "Harley: Frank, take this for a second. I want to talk to you guys, okay. Come here. You sit over here. Okay, I want to talk to you before we have our ice cream.",
        "Zach: Where's gus?",
        "Harley: Gus isn't here.",
        "Frank: If harley sees you, she's going to come out swinging. So unless you really want to make things worse, do her favor stay away.",
        "Beth: Yeah, you're in for the fight of your life, but you can't give up. Do whatever it takes.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, no, no, no. You think I don't know some of the rules around the police station. Well, I'll tell you you're treating me like a common prisoner. And I am not a common prisoner. You just wait until my lawyers get a hold of you.",
        "Ross: What's going on?",
        "Cop: She won't shut up until she sees you.",
        "Ross: Well, you have procedures to take care of it.",
        "Alexandra: I'm asking a very simple thing!",
        "Cop: She's alexandra spaulding. I didn't know what to do.",
        "Alexandra: And I just talked to ross, and all I'm asking you is not a big deal--",
        "Ross: Alex, pipe down. What is wrong with you?",
        "Alexandra: Sorry, ross, but I... well, I really have nothing to lose, do I?",
        "Ross: What are you saying?",
        "Alexandra: It's very simple. I want to make a deal.",
        "Alan: Phillip, you know how happy I am that you finally got rid of that woman. Just remember these things take time and planning.",
        "Phillip: Grandpa, don't you know me a little better than that?",
        "Alan: Then you do have something in mind.",
        "Phillip: Oh, olivia may think that she's free. I actually have big plans for her. And she's not the only one.",
        "Ross: Alexandra, if you want to make a confession , I need to get jeffrey o'neill in here.",
        "Alexandra: Nobody said anything about a confession, ross.",
        "Ross: You just said that you wanted to make a deal.",
        "Alexandra: Well, not that kind of a deal. I want to help frank cooper.",
        "Ross: Well, how generous of you. You're just a little late though.",
        "Alexandra: Maybe for me, but not for frank.",
        "Ross: Well, I had a feeling that he could survive this until he pulled a gun on alan in public. And now I don't think there's anybody who can help him now.",
        "Harley: You guys know that mommy and gus did not get married yesterday, right? Well, it looks like we're not getting married at all now.",
        "Zach: Why?",
        "Harley: Well, because sometimes things keep people apart even when they love each other very much.",
        "Frank: Well, that doesn't mean that the love stops here, because this house has a whole lot of love in it.",
        "Marina: Oh, tons. (Laughter)",
        "Buzz: Gus just won't be part of the family, but the rest of us will still be here.",
        "Frank: Yeah, and we're not going anywhere. I promise.",
        "Harley: Yeah, yeah. We are a family. All of us. All of us and uncle frank and grandpa and marina. And we are going to be okay.",
        "Marina: Yes, we are.",
        "Zach: Mommy, are you sad?",
        "Harley: How could I be sad when I have the two best boys in the whole world in my arms. Right?",
        "Buzz: Right.",
        "Zach: Can we have ice cream now? (Laughter)",
        "Frank: Of course you can.",
        "Harley: Yes. Wait. Let me see your hands.",
        "Buzz: Dirty hands.",
        "Harley: Please go wash your hands first.",
