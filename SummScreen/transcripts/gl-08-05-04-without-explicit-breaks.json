        "Michelle: The studio said you got the okay to do this interview? This is big, huh?",
        "Reva: It's big, yeah. And the subject matter is very controversial. I think maybe this wouldn't be the best time for you.",

        "Michelle: (Sighs) well, I probably read it somewhere. But that's something that you would tell me, right?",
        "Reva: No, probably not. Look, you're having a hard enough time dealing with the here and now.",
        "Michelle: Oh, no, reva, you don't understand.",
        "Reva: Okay. Michelle, there's something i should tell you. Something that no one's told you and I shouldn't be the first to say anything.",
        "Michelle: I won't hold it against you. What?",
        "Reva: Rumor has it that your accident wasn't one. That it was vinnie salerno who ordered that warehouse to blown up.",
        "Michelle: You mean a hit on me?",
        "Reva: I don't think so. People think that you were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.",

        "Reva: Okay. Okay. You can observe, but there are conditions. You have to stay in the background and you're going to have to call danny. If he says it's okay, then it's okay with me.",
        "Josh: So this person rediscovering love that would be michelle.",
        "Danny: Yeah. Looks that way.",
        "Josh: And the passion would be directed toward you, I hope.",
        "Danny: I hope so, too. It's been a little hard to adjust to. It's kind like having a teenager in the house. I mean michelle sees a wall and she wants to run straight into it.",
        "Josh: How are you holding up?",
        "Danny: It's kind of hard not to hope that she'll wake up and be old michelle again. But...",
        "Josh: You said you wanted to talk about business?",
        "Danny: Yeah, yeah. I was just wondering... Just wondering when i might be able to expect the first check from condo development project.",

        "Danny: Right. Okay.",
        "Josh: What's that? You don't like being called that?",
        "Danny: No. You know, no. I just want to be a business man. That's it. I've had my 15 seconds. The only problem with that is, where do you go when those 15 seconds are up?",
        "Helper: Can i help you?",
        "Edmund: No, no. Thank you. I'm fine. Actually, you know, maybe you can help me. I'm looking for a woman...",
        "Helper: Oh, you're not really my type.",
        "Edmund: Right. My loss, i'm sure. I this case, i'm looking for an attractive woman, but blonde. She sort of has hitchcoky and grace kelly, tippy hedron air about her.",
        "Helper: I'm sure some of those words made sense... Just not to me.",
        "Edmund: My fault I'm sure. Thank you. You've been very helpful. This better be worth my time.",
        "Dinah: Oh, oh. Come here, sweetie. You are doing so good at this game, okay. But let's see if we could even more quiet. We don't want mommy to hear us, okay. And when she walks in she may get a real big surprise and that won't make her happy, okay?",
        "Cassie: What aren't you telling me?",
        "Jeffrey: Are you sure everything's okay?",

        "Cassie: Okay, whatever. Look is this about my case? Do you have a lead?",
        "Jeffrey: What? No, no, no. No, the agencies are taking care of that, cassie. Don't worry. They're trying to track down the person's who's impersonating you, but that's going to take some time.",

        "Jeffrey: I'm taking care of it. You don't need to worry.",
        "Cassie: Okay and you're going to let me know when I need to start worrying?",
        "Jeffrey: I didn't even come here to discuss your missing identity or your stolen identity, okay. I came here to talk to you about you testifying at the salerno trial.",
        "Cassie: You could have asked me that over the telephone, jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I prefer face to face, mrs. Winslow.",
        "Cassie: No, you don't. Not at all. So why don't you tell me the real reason you came here, all right? Now you just said that you lost this imposter, okay. Are you concerned tat she's going to come here?",
        "Cassie: Do I have a reason to worry that this other cassie is going to come after me, jeffrey?",
        "Rj: Surprise!",
        "Cassie: Oh, my gosh. (Laughs) hey, you little stinker. Come here.",

        "Rj: She's real.",
        "Cassie: Rj.",
        "Edmund: She's real, huh? Do you think i can meet her, rj? I won't tell if it's a secret. It's okay. Come on. Show me. Where? Over here? Hello? Hello, rj's imaginary friend. Are you around here?",

        "Jeffrey: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: You're doing it again. You're having that dazed thought going on inside your head that someone may know something about, but you're not telling me.",
        "Jeffrey: And what can i say, mrs. Winslow? I'm a mystery.",
        "Cassie: Well, ain't that the truth. Can we get back to business, please?",

        "Dinah: Oh. I'm sorry. Did you have something better to do?",
        "Edmund: What? Than skulk about a street corner waiting for some mystery woman who claims to have information about cassie and jeffrey o'neill that probably isn't worth waiting for anyway? No, of course not.",
        "Dinah: Well, then why are you waiting?",
        "Lizzie: It's not my fault she violated zoning laws. It's a competition, tammy. I want to win.",
        "Joey: Yeah, lizzie, i want to win also, but because I have the best ideas, not because i trashed the other players.",
        "Lizzie: I didn't trash her. Okay, fine. Go ahead and sue me, all right? Sometimes you do have to win ugly.",
        "Joey: No you don't, lizzie. You need to check yourself.",

        "Tammy: You!",
        "Joey: Me, what?",
        "Tammy: You really don't see it? Lizzie. Everything she does. There is not a truthful, honest bone in that girl's body.",
        "Joey: Look, tammy, we're right in the middle of a competition. What am I supposed to do?",
        "Tammy: Keep your new girlfriend on a leash. And get her to stop trashing me.",
        "Joey: Whoa. She's not my girlfriend.",
        "Tammy: Save it.",
        "Joey: Tammy? What is wrong with me finally getting my music out there?",
        "Tammy: Do you have to turn off your brain to do that?",
        "Joey: I'm not turning off my brain.",
        "Tammy: Right. You're just turning your back on me.",
        "Joey: Do we have to do this right now? Here. I thought you should want one, you know? Most of the songs are about you, anyway. Come on. Tammy, look...",
        "Tammy: Joey...",
        "Joey: You first.",
        "Tammy: No, you.",
        "Joey: What I was going to say was, at first I thought all these love songs were corny, you know? I'd never written one until i met you, and then I just couldn't stop.",
        "Tammy: If that's how you feel, then why can't we...",
        "Joey: Because tammy, at first all I could write about was love. And now all I can think about is getting my heart stomped on.",
        "Tammy: By me. I messed up. I did. We both know that. But I swear, i can change everything. Will you let me try?",
        "Lizzie: Hey. I'm not stepping on a moment, am i? Because I really wouldn't want to do that.",

        "Josh: I'll call you tomorrow, okay?",
        "Danny: Yeah. Thanks again.",
        "Josh: How's the curve ball going? Good?",
        "Marina: Wicked.",
        "Josh: Uh-oh. Son!",
        "Danny: Wicked. Hey.",
        "Marina: Hey.",
        "Danny: You okay?",
        "Marina: Great. I'm awesome. Great.",
        "Danny: Shayne's throwing again. Shouldn't your feet be ten feet off the ground?",
        "Marina: Is that how you are with michelle?",
        "Danny: Sometimes. Sometimes I don't know what to feel.",
        "Marina: Yeah. Me, too.",
        "Reva: I'll give you a high- five on when to come in. You stay out here.",
        "Michelle: Tell salerno I said hi.",
        "Reva: That's funny.",
        "Salerno: Ah. Reva, reva, reva. You missed me, didn't you?",
        "Reva: Nice suit, vinnie.",
        "Salerno: Orange isn't really my color, but... You can go now. This thing happens on my terms or it ain't happening.",
        "Reva: Warden?",
        "Warden: Salerno, the guards are just looking for an excuse.",
        "Salerno: He thinks he runs the joint, but he's just some guys with keys on his belt. Everybody knows who's got the real juice in here.",
        "Reva: And who would that be? The guy with the cuffs and the chains?",
        "Salerno: Freedom takes on many forms, reva.",
        "Reva: You know, a lot of convicts try to come up with some sort of jailhouse philosophy in order to survive. Yours sounds more like delusions of grandeur.",
        "Michelle: She's good.",
        "Salerno: That's what I like about you. No fear. You and I could have been a good team. My brains, your psychic whatever-you-call-it. Is it true that you can look into the future? Because I'd like to know when i'm going to bust out of this joint.",
        "Reva: You know, vinnie, i don't have to be psychic to know that you're going to be spending a very, very long time in here.",
        "Salerno: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Since when do coma victims get around on their own? This day just keeps getting better all the time.",
        "Reva: Can we just get to the interview, vinnie?",
        "Salerno: No, no, no. What's the rush? Come on. I want to catch up with my old friend. Michelle santos, as I live and breathe. Come in, join us. I've got to hear about this miraculous recovery.",
        "jeffrey: You know, rj-- here you go-- i'm more of a scotch and cigars kind of guy, but this milk and cookies thing is pretty good. You know, some people say I'm a mean guy. You don't think I'm a mean guy, do you?",
        "Rj: Nope.",
        "Jeffrey: And I know how milk and cookies works. Here. You take one, I'll take one. What you do is, you have to break it in half first, and then you dip it, and then you bite. Simple, right? You know, rj, this imaginary friend of yours, why don't you tell me about her? It's a woman, right?",
        "Rj: She said I can'T.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, come on. I'm your pal, o'neill. You can tell me anything, right? All right, look. You just... You don't have to say anything, just answer yes or no. Is she blonde? Uh-huh. Is she pretty? Did she talk about your mom?",
        "Rj: And she flies like superman.",
        "Jeffrey: She does, does she? Well, I'd like to meet this person. Listen, I've got to run, okay? You finish all the cookies. And lock this door after i leave, okay? You promise? All right, buddy. See you later.",
        "Cassie: Hey. How was the beach?",
        "Tammy: Lizzie clocked me again.",
        "Cassie: Translation?",
        "Tammy: Creamed. Punked. She beat me again. Okay? And no, please no more of your lectures about whatever you want to lecture me about. I'm just going to go on upstairs and put on my nun's habit.",
        "Cassie: Wait. Wait. Hold on. Honey, i'm sorry. I'm so sorry that I gave you a hard time earlier about the car wash. I am. Just seeing you walk in, and i don't know, you were wearing that skimpy outfit and it really brought back a lot of stuff for me. It was my baggage and I'm really sorry, tammy.",
        "Tammy: I kind of figured that, anyway.",
        "Cassie: Reva gave me a hard time about it, too.",
        "Tammy: If we're going to talk, can we talk?",
        "Cassie: Okay.",
        "Tammy: I know how you feel about who you used to be. But that doesn't mean I feel that way. I love you. And I see what you've done with your life. Mom, you own half this hotel. You have a huge farm. Uncle edmund is great and he loves you. You're a freaking princess, okay? Things have turned out great for you.",
        "Cassie: Yes, tammy, but not without a lot of pain, and that's what I want to protect you from.",
        "Tammy: I can take the pain.",
        "Cassie: But the point is, i don't want you to. Okay? That's my life's goal is to make sure you don't have to.",
        "Tammy: Maybe it's supposed to be hard, mom. I mean, no one gets anything for free. Maybe I'm supposed to make mistakes. As long as i end up on top.",
        "Cassie: I don't like hearing you say all this stuff, you know?",
        "Tammy: Well, why? Why? Because it's not sweet? Because it's not nice tammy, harmless tammy, everyone's favorite loser?",
        "Cassie: Okay, would you stop? You are not a loser. And get that through your head. You are 100 lizzie spauldings, okay? I wouldn't wish that child on anybody.",
        "Tammy: You have to say that, you're my mother.",
        "Cassie: I don't have to say anything.",
        "Tammy: Well, it still doesn't help where joey is concerned.",
        "Cassie: So lizzie wins.",
        "Tammy: Doesn't she always?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, if you play the game her way. But what if you play it yours?",
        "Tammy: I hate it when you make sense.",
        "Cassie: (Laughs)",
        "tammy: Hey, don't bother wishing me luck, you know? When it comes to lizzie, i need a cattle prod.",
        "Cassie: Good luck, sweetie.",
        "Lizzie: Come on.",
        "Joey: Okay.",
        "Lizzie: He's coming here. Right here, right now. Okay, take off your shirt.",
        "Joey: Whoa. No, what...",
        "Lizzie: Whoo, come on.",
        "Joey: What are you talking about?",
        "Lizzie: You look great. I just hooked you up. Hello? The record exec I introduced you to at harley and gus' so-called wedding?",
        "Joey: What? You got him to come down to the beach, here?",
        "Lizzie: Okay, you remember i told you you need a business angel? Well, I meant that i was your angel.",
        "Joey: Right, lizzie. To help me sell my cds.",
        "Lizzie: We're going to do a lot more than that. Hey, ron!",
        "Ron: Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: How are you? What's up?",
        "Ron: How's it going?",
        "Lizzie: You remember joey lupo, right?",
        "Joey: Hi.",
        "Ron: Lizzie gave me a copy of your demo. You've got some nice stuff on there, partner.",
        "Joey: For real?",
        "Ron: Most definitely. Good beats, nice flava to the mix. Your voice is strong, you've got flow and you rhyme. Good hooks!",
        "Lizzie: Didn't I say so?",
        "Ron: Now, i don't know what else lizzie told you, but I'm with a small label.",
        "Joey: There's nothing wrong with a small label. (Laughter)",
        "ron: We need someone like you in the stable. Now, i can't get you to sign on the dotted line without a green light, but as a show of good faith, i'll take every cd you've got, spread you around the clubs up in chi-town, some industry parties. Man, i think people will like what they hear.",
        "Joey: I don't know what to say. Here. Take the whole thing.",
        "Ron: I'll take all your cds. Next step is making a deal. Why don't you talk to your business manager about that?",
        "Joey: (Laughs)",
        "lizzie: I hope I didn't cross the line or anything. I mean...",
        "Joey: Oh, my god. Thank you so much! (Laughs)",
        "lizzie: Joey, don't you get it? I told you i'd do anything for you.",
        "Josh: Wow. You are throwing better than ever.",
        "Shayne: It feels that way.",
        "Josh: Listen, you know, i just want to say this. If you're nervous at all about this tryout with the cubs, if that has anything to do with me, forget about it, all right? My stage father days are done. Over. I just want what's best for you. I want you to do what you want to do, and i will back your play no matter what. All right?",
        "Shayne: All right. I still do love the game.",
        "Josh: You certainly throw like you do.",
        "Shayne: But you know what i love most about it? I loved being part of a team, you know? Everybody pitches in, everybody helps out. Kind of like our family is.",
        "Josh: Well, yeah. Eventually we get where we're going together, yes.",
        "Shayne: That's what i like, you know? The feeling of being part of a team.",
        "Josh: But you don't necessarily like the idea of being part of a baseball team anymore? Is that it?",
        "Shayne: Not the way i used to and not the way I should if I'm going to make it in the pros. I mean, those guys, that's all they do.",
        "Josh: Well, yes. For some of those guys, it's the most important aspect of anything in their lives.",
        "Shayne: Yeah. And for what? For what? Stats? Numbers? A pennant?",
        "Josh: Okay, so what's important to you, right now?",
        "Shayne: Something bigger. You know, I feel like I've been handed this miracle. I could have died and I didn't. You know, is all that just so that i can play baseball again? I mean, is god such a big fan that he's, like, you know, \"I've got this lewis kid. Let me give him a second shot so he can... You know, the cubs are in trouble this season.\"",
        "Josh: (Laughs) I don't know anything about that. I do like the idea, though, that god's a cubbies fan. That's cool.",
        "Shayne: We can't pick up where we left off. That's just not how it works.",
        "Josh: What are you trying to say, son?",
        "Shayne: Today, I helped this kid learn how to throw and it was great. And it wasn't because I could throw again. It was because i was helping him.",
        "Josh: You were sharing your gift, and that's a great thing. You know, when somebody can throw a ball like you do, others can't really understand what that feels like. I don't understand what the feels like. But I also can see that... That you want something else in life. I think you were trying to share that with your mom and me the other night. So, what is that? Do you have any ideas at all?",
        "Shayne: Well, i was kind of hoping that you could help me out with that.",
        "Danny: Well, I guess we're both in the same boat, kind of, with michelle and shayne both trying to put their lives back together. You want me to tell you what i've figured out so far?",
        "Marina: Okay, mr. Experience.",
        "Danny: Just don't try to force shayne back into who he used to be before. He really has to figure out who he is now and what he wants.",
        "Marina: Yeah. Can you do that with michelle?",
        "Danny: I'm trying.",
        "Reva: Michelle? Just stay outside the door.",
        "Salerno: I don't know. She looks curious. Come on. We used to be old friends. You don't come in and say hello?",
        "Michelle: I don't remember you.",
        "Salerno: Oh, yeah? I remember you. I remember danny coming to work for me. I remember you inviting me into your home. I know that you and your husband conned me and set me up. I'm in here because of you.",
        "Michelle: Well, sorry. Don't remember.",
        "Salerno: Well, that's funny, because what you did, putting me in here, that's something I'll never forget.",
        "Cassie: Oh, hey. Have you heard from ambassador winslow?",
        "Desk clerk: Oh, yes. He received a message and took off.",
        "Cassie: Did he say where he was going?",
        "Desk clerk: No, but it seemed urgent. He called several times to make sure his appointment hadn't been canceled.",
        "Dinah: I'm bored of the banter. Can we get to the point? We both know what this is about.",
        "Edmund: Jeffrey o'neill. What do you know about him?",
        "Dinah: Well, I'm not going to tell you everything right now, but what i will tell you is that we're going to meet on my terms and around my schedule.",
        "Edmund: And if I don't agree?",
        "Dinah: Well, that would be your choice. But I have a feeling that you're going to want to know the information. And if you tell anybody about this, you will never see me again. And you'll wonder if you could have protected cassie from a man who can only hurt her.",
        "Edmund: I'm not a fan of blind faith, so either you tell me something right now or you're a liar and a waste of time.",
        "Dinah: Okay. I respect that you want to sample the goods, so i will give you a little tidbit to chew on. I can help you answer a question that has been burning in the back of your mind ever since jeffrey came here: Why would a man who looks exactly like your dead brother-- the love of cassie's life-- suddenly show up in this town and move into her hotel. Hooked?",
        "Lizzie: Don't you...",
        "Joey: I'm going to get you back.",
        "Lizzie: Nobody saw it. (Squeals)",
        "joey: I'm going to get you back.",
        "Lizzie: Hey, I waited until you were in the water. (Laughter) stop! Ow! (Laughter)",
        "joey: Lizzie? You really came through for me, getting that record guy to come down here and listen to my music.",
        "Lizzie: I told you we make a great team. And a great couple?",
        "Joey: (Laughs) well...",
        "Lizzie: Where are you going?",
        "Joey: Ten bucks. I want to go tell everyone about the meeting. I mean, sandy, shayne, remy. My mom's going to freak when she hears the good news. I mean, she's always telling me to get a real job. Thank you.",
        "Ron: How did I do?",
        "Lizzie: Well, when it comes to your future to spaulding, that was a slam dunk! Thank you so much.",
        "Ron: You going to keep your end of the bargain?",
        "Lizzie: Yes. I will be sure to tell grandpa about the new junior executive in the music department.",
        "Ron: The recommendation will help, but I've got bills to pay.",
        "Lizzie: Right. Okay. There you are. All right. You're worth every penny, ron. Now could you just forget you ever met me?",
        "Ron: What do I do with the dude's cds?",
        "Lizzie: You can do whatever you want with them. Just make sure no one sees you.",
        "Ron: You don't want to keep one as a souvenir of your guy?",
        "Lizzie: What do i need that for? I've got the real thing.",
        "Danny: Yeah. Reva lewis, please? Danny santos. Oh. Well, actually i'm looking for michelle santos. She's observing at the studio today. Oh. A live interview? Okay, great, yeah. I'll check it out. Thanks.",
        "Salerno: Come on, michelle. Come on in.",
        "Reva: No, michelle. You stay behind the door.",
        "Salerno: No, no, michelle. Don't go. Maybe something I say will spark your memory, all right? I'll get you a front row seat. You can sit on uncle vinnie's lap.",
        "Reva: She's not staying.",
        "Salerno: You don't want to miss this one in action. I mean, you've got to see her. Cool as a cucumber, even with a gun to her head.",
        "Reva: You know what, vinnie? We'll go over our greatest hits in a minute. Michelle? Now. Out. (Alarm buzzing) what's going on?",
        "Guard: We've got a riot in cell block d.",
        "Reva: A riot? Fine, I want my people out of here. I want michelle out of here, now.",
        "Guard: We're in lock down, ma'am. Nobody gets in or out. (Alarm buzzing) next, on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Dinah: If you tell me that you never worried whether or not jeffrey o'neill was interested in cassie, then I'd have to call you a liar. And if you tell me that you're sure there's nothing more to worry about, i'd have to call you a damned fool.",
        "Gus: So now what? You're going to exile me because i tried to do both, and love you and my new family?",
        "Harley: Yes."
