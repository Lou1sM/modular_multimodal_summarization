        "Harley: So, after everything that we have been through, you-- Mr. \"I could marry you right now\" guy-- you want to postpone the wedding.",
        "Gus: I would marry you right now. I'd marry you right now, but I just think we should wait.",
        "Harley: Why? For how long?",
        "Gus: Just until you are 100% sure of what you're doing.",
        "Harley: I'm sure.",
        "Gus: You're sure?",
        "Harley: Honey, I'm sure. I'm as sure as you are.",
        "Gus: Oh, you're so sure? Right. Just like you were sure when I asked you to move in-- which I didn't ask you to move into the Spaulding house, but you volunteered, remember? And then you took it back, which is very strange to me. I mean, if we're going to be together...",
        "Harley: Okay, but that had absolutely nothing to do with the wedding and you know it.",
        "Gus: What does it have to do with? What does it have to do with? A ghost? Some ghost thing? What, from our past? Your past?",
        "Harley: What do you mean?",
        "Gus: No, I'm not talking about him. I'm talking about the other ghost. Phillip. And how Alan keeps saying he's alive and you're buying into it. And I know you're buying into it because I look at you and I see it in your face.",
        "Mallet: Harley. Wait until you hear this. It's about Phillip.",
        "Gus: So, denial ain't just a river in Egypt, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: What do you mean, I've been \"de-approved\"? I've been using this credit card since I could read it. Excuse me, okay, but I probably put your kids through college last year on my shoe bill alone. This... what? Fine.",
        "Coop: Well. Well, well, well. What's that all about?",
        "Lizzie: This is terrible, Coop.",
        "Coop: Okay. Well, what happened?",
        "Lizzie: My credit cards got declined. I think my mom turned them off. I couldn't even buy my end-of-summer outfit.",
        "Coop: Oh, my... no. Are you kidding...?",
        "Lizzie: Coop, please don't even start right now. This is not funny.",
        "Coop: Sorry. ( Sighs ) Fine, it's not funny.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Does the name ring a bell? Sonya? Sonya?",
        "Jeffrey: Sonya. Well, you know what? Sonya is a friend. She's a former friend. Well, not really former.",
        "Cassie: Occasional friend?",
        "Jeffrey: The point of the matter is, that's all changed.",
        "Cassie: I don't think she knows that.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, then she's going to find out because what Sonya really is, is a vestige. She's a vestige of the life that I led before I met you.",
        "Cassie: A vestige?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: Like an appendix? Like the bone in your butt where the tail used to be?",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, okay. I deserve it. Have your fun. But the point of the matter is that I am crazy about you in a way that even seems crazy to me.",
        "Cassie: Hm. You've got to prove it.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Wait right there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: You know, I wouldn't make a very good lure if you hurt me. So, who's the trap for? Aunt Reva?",
        "Nate: If I wanted Reva, I could have already had her. In a variety of ways.",
        "Tammy: That's disgusting.",
        "Nate: You know damn well who I'm after. And you're going to deliver him for me.",
        "Tammy: I don't see how.",
        "Nate: No? Well, maybe you're not as smart as I thought you were.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan hates me and I hate him.",
        "Nate: I'm not interested in your little teen dramas, all right? I've watched you two. You're like no cousins I've ever seen. Jonathan will come for you, all right?",
        "Tammy: He won't even know I'm gone.",
        "Nate: Well, no doubt your family's put out the alarm by now. Jonathan will hear it and when he does, he'll come running.",
        "Tammy: Never.",
        "Nate: All we have to do is sit back, wait and enjoy the view. You sure you don't want one?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "( Knock on door )",
        "Nina: I guess I'm too late for your shower.",
        "Jonathan: I may need another one. Why is the manager bringing towels? I thought that was a job for housekeeping.",
        "Nina: Well, I believe in the personal touch. Feeling better this morning? Looks like you're healing up pretty well.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Thanks to you. So, do you have anything else for me?",
        "Nina: Actually, I do. I took the morning off. I thought I might give you a tour of the interesting sites in town. Unless you have something more important to do.",
        "Tammy: I wish I never met you.",
        "Jonathan: Can't think of a thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: If you're waiting for Jonathan to come rescue me, you'll be waiting forever.",
        "Nate: You've been abducted by his devil of a father. Poor little princess, you're helpless.",
        "Tammy: It doesn't matter. You've trained Jonathan too well. He won't stick his neck out for anybody, okay? Especially not me.",
        "Nate: What's going on between you two? Do you have this, like, competition to see who can pretend not to care the most? Any fool can see that you two love...",
        "Tammy: Don't say it. ( Sniffles ) Fine. I admit it. I do care about Jonathan. And part of me wishes...",
        "Nate: What?",
        "Tammy: That he would come. I mean, the last thing I want is for you to hurt him, but if he heard that I was here and tried to rescue me, that would be...",
        "Nate: Sweet?",
        "Tammy: It wasn't my idea to feel the way I feel, but... ( Sighs ) I wish I didn't, but I can't help it.",
        "Nate: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, no, no, no. It's all right. You go ahead and cry. Go on. Crying's good. It's good for me, especially. It proves I'm right. You and my boy, you're like a little pair of forbidden lovebirds. Jonathan will definitely come looking for you and he'll find you. We'll see to that. It's kind of sweet, isn't it?",
        "Tammy: ( Yells )",
        "Nate: What is it, Tammy? Don't you find me attractive?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Well, here it is.",
        "Cassie: Is that a little black book? You actually have one of those?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you know, when it comes to bachelorhood, I consider myself a traditionalist. But times have changed. I meet you; Good-bye book.",
        "Cassie: Wait, wait, wait.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, what? You want to do the honors? Okay, be my guest.",
        "Cassie: I want to have a peek. ( Laughs )",
        "Jeffrey: What? Wait a minute. Wait.",
        "Cassie: Oh, my God. There are so many women in here. You could start a small country.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, I'm glad you're having fun with all this.",
        "Cassie: What are all these little symbols next to these... this is a rating system. Oh, my gosh. Jeffrey O'Neill's secret sex summary. This is good. \"C.\" Let's look under \"C.\"",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, just throw it out, okay?",
        "Cassie: Hm, no \"Cassie.\" Maybe under \"M,\" for \"Mrs. Winslow.\" Let's check...",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, come on.",
        "Cassie: What? Do I not rate? I'm not even in here. It's got to be under \"W.\"",
        "Jeffrey: You can't compare to those women. What I mean is that, you know, you are off the charts, baby, yeah. Because you set a standard that no one else could possibly live up to.",
        "Cassie: Nice save.",
        "Jeffrey: Thank you.",
        "Cassie: There's no turning back. Say goodbye to Abigail and Zelda and everyone in between.",
        "Jeffrey: What did you do, memorize the thing?",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, here we go. Good-bye, ladies. Many happy landings. Okay, let her rip. See? I barely flinched.",
        "Cassie: ( Laughs ) You know, we're going to have to monitor you in case there's some after effects.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I can tell you one after-effect that I am looking forward to.",
        "Reva: Cassie. Oh, honey, thank God I found you.",
        "Cassie: What's going on? What's wrong?",
        "Reva: It's Tammy. It's about Tammy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: So, if you've got news about Phillip, spill it.",
        "Mallet: I mean, it's not about Phillip, really. It involves him.",
        "Gus: Listening.",
        "Mallet: Well, Alan still swears that Phillip isn't really dead.",
        "Gus: Is that right?",
        "Harley: Mm-hmm.",
        "Gus: We knew that.",
        "Harley: Yeah, I mean, that poor, poor man, he is so, so deluded.",
        "Mallet: So he's been, you know, trying to get a hold of me. He's offering bribes, he's making threats, and I just wanted to make sure that you both knew that I'm not going to let him use his money or his muscle to get someone in authority to believe his story.",
        "Harley: Thank you. We really appreciate that, because that lets us focus on our wedding.",
        "Gus: Right. Speaking of which, I need to reschedule the appointment with the planner.",
        "Harley: Oh, would you do that?",
        "Gus: Sure.",
        "Harley: Thank you, honey. What's wrong with you? I told you I don't want him involved in any of this.",
        "Mallet: I don't want you involved. Didn't I tell you to just drop it and let me handle this? You know what? From now on, if I get something, I'm just going to have to keep it to myself.",
        "Harley: Get something like what?",
        "Mallet: What? What are you talking about?",
        "Harley: You said \"get something.\" What?",
        "Mallet: Oh, nothing. It was a figure of speech.",
        "Harley: No, it wasn't.",
        "Mallet: Gus is right over there.",
        "Harley: So you then you better spill it fast.",
        "Mallet: I talked to the janitor in the building where Alan claims Phillip was being kept.",
        "Harley: Uh-huh. And?",
        "Mallet: Apparently, a doctor and some sort of nurse made regular visits to room number five. And guess who the only other person with a key to room number five was.",
        "Harley: ( Coughs ) Alan?",
        "Mallet: Alan. You got it.",
        "Harley: That doesn't mean that Phillip was actually in there. It just means that Alan was working on some dark secret Spaulding research project.",
        "Mallet: You don't believe that, do you?",
        "Harley: You know what I believe? I believe that I finally marrying the man that I love, who is standing right over there. So it doesn't matter to me what happens in room number five, number six, number seven. I don't care.",
        "Mallet: Okay. That's great. Fine.",
        "Harley: No. I care. Of course I care. I have to know. I have to know, and there's only one way to find out for sure.",
        "Mallet: What are you planning?",
        "Harley: Well, I wouldn't want you to worry about it.",
        "Mallet: Oh, I'm not worried, but I see your wheels turning and I want to know where you're headed.",
        "Harley: Ssh... ssh... Hi.",
        "Gus: Hi.",
        "Harley: She... did you get in touch with her? The wedding planner?",
        "Gus: Rescheduled for tonight.",
        "Harley: Oh, good. Well, that's perfect. So, before I have to go meet with the florist and the cake guy, I should go talk to one of my bridesmaids.",
        "Gus: Are you going to ask Lizzie to be a bridesmaid?",
        "Harley: Honey, we have talked about this already, many times. I'm not just marrying you, I am marrying your entire family, right? And vice versa. So let me talk to her before she takes off, okay?",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: Can I have a chocolate kiss, please?",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: Thank you.",
        "Gus: So, what did you really come to ask Harley, or tell her, about Phillip?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Hey. Can I talk to you for a minute? Alone?",
        "Coop: Sure. Why not? I'll be over there.",
        "Harley: Thank you.",
        "Lizzie: Did my mom send you?",
        "Harley: Why would she do that?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, because she wants me to admit that without my money and my credit cards, I'm helpless and I should come home like the little girl she thinks I am. But I'm really not.",
        "Harley: She cut you off.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. I'm broke.",
        "Harley: I guess you've had a pretty hard time of it since your dad died, huh? Or, at least until everyone in your life except your grandpa thought your dad had died.",
        "Lizzie: And he knows how hard it is on me, how much I would want that to be true, but I mean, deep down inside, I know it's not.",
        "Harley: Yeah. Well, I mean, there is a way to stop your grandpa's ranting. I don't think that you would like it, but you are the only person who could make it happen.",
        "Lizzie: How?",
        "Harley: You are Phillip's next of kin. If you wanted to, you could give the police permission to exhume his body and that would prove to everyone-- even to Alan-- that he's dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You had to play hero? Now my daughter's missing?",
        "Reva: I wasn't playing at anything. I did what I did to Nate to protect Jonathan. He's the one who's really in jeopardy here.",
        "Cassie: Oh, really? Tammy has been dragged off by some lunatic who beat his son and may have murdered his wife, but Jonathan's the one in real danger, here. So you don't care about Tammy. You're not worried about Tammy.",
        "Reva: That's not true.",
        "Cassie: You're only worried about your precious...",
        "Reva: That is not true and you know it.",
        "Cassie: No. I don't even want to hear it, Reva! It has been \"Jonathan, Jonathan, Jonathan\" since he came to town. \"Give Jonathan a break,\" no matter what he did.",
        "Reva: He's a troubled kid because of what Nate did to him. That's why I had to stop the man.",
        "Cassie: So now Tammy's paying the price again because of what you want. First she was victimized by Jonathan, now by his father, all so you can feel less guilty for how you screwed up.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, you know, I think this is not helping. What we really need to do is to focus on finding Tammy and getting her back safely.",
        "Reva: Then get a search going for her. You know? I don't know, set up some kind of special task force. But you have to do it in a way that Nate isn't tipped off that we're looking for Tammy. You can do that, right? I mean, you're the DA.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, we have to proceed with extreme caution, Reva. This is a violent and desperate man. The last thing we want to do is put Tammy in any more danger.",
        "Cassie: Any more danger.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: If you keep fighting, we're both going to end up in the drink. Now, you're probably a better swimmer than Johnny, but I can't promise you'll come out of the water alive. All right? Agreed? All right.",
        "Tammy: Ow. Hey.",
        "Nate: Oh, sorry. Was that too rough? How about this?",
        "Tammy: Ow.",
        "Nate: I have to say, I admire your pluck. And when it's packaged like this, I could understand what Jon...",
        "Tammy: Get away from me.",
        "Nate: Hello, hello, hello. You've been holding out on me, Tammy, and that's not a very smart thing to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nina: What's wrong? I thought this is what you wanted.",
        "Jonathan: It is. Definitely. Where were we? Right here? ( Knock at door ) Don't tell me that's housekeeping.",
        "Nina: If it is, they'll open the door themselves in a second.",
        "Jonathan: Okay.",
        "Nina: If they catch me here...",
        "Jonathan: I'll get it. What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Sandy: You're not as smart as you think you are, \"Sandy Foster.\"",
        "Jonathan: Good detective work. See you.",
        "Sandy: Uh, uh. You know, I was hoping I would never see you again, but I need your help.",
        "Nina: Sir, I was just coming by to see if you were happy with the accommodations.",
        "Jonathan: Well, I might need some more attention tonight. You ought to stay here sometime, Sandman. The staff bends over backwards to please you.",
        "Sandy: You've got to come back to Springfield.",
        "Jonathan: I don't \"got\" to do anything. I have over $2 million. I have a hottie bringing me fluffy white towels.",
        "Sandy: Tammy's in trouble. Your father's got her and you need to help me find her.",
        "Jonathan: Are you saying he kidnapped Tammy?",
        "Sandy: I'm saying he's got her and we've got to get her back.",
        "Jonathan: \"We\" do?",
        "Sandy: All I care about is Tammy's safety right now, and if you can help me get her away from Nate, then that's all that matters.",
        "Jonathan: He's a sick freak.",
        "Sandy: Yeah. All right, then. Let's go. Every second counts. Come on.",
        "Jonathan: She's your girl. She's your problem. You deal with it.",
        "Sandy: Reva's always talking about what a victim you are, how your father turned you into this miserable excuse of a human being, but if you sit here and don't even lift a finger to help Tammy, you're making her your victim all over again, and you're going to have to live with that.",
        "Jonathan: No problem.",
        "Sandy: Yeah? Good luck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I bet you can't wait for Jonathan to show up, huh? You're good at hurting little boys.",
        "Nate: Do I not scare you?",
        "Tammy: I'm scared, yeah, but I'm more scared for Jonathan than myself.",
        "Nate: I would worry about your own welfare.",
        "Tammy: He had the same sneer when he first came to town. That same need to frighten and control people.",
        "Nate: It worked on you, though, didn't it?",
        "Tammy: Yeah, it did. You created a monster. But at some point, that monster stopped wanting to be one. He started to see himself as a person.",
        "Nate: Yeah? Oh, dear, where did I go wrong?",
        "Tammy: Jonathan started thinking for himself, seeing Reva and the world in his own eyes, not through yours.",
        "Nate: Jonathan went soft. That's what he did. Don't you worry. I'll toughen him up again.",
        "Tammy: By slapping him around and humiliating him or worse?",
        "Nate: Yeah. Something like that.",
        "Tammy: Don't. Don't do it. Please.",
        "Nate: Is it time for the heartfelt plea? All right, Princess, come on. Come on. Let's hear it.",
        "Tammy: Maybe you love Jonathan in your own way. I'm sure you think that he needs what you give him, but he doesn't. Okay? What he needs...",
        "Nate: Stop! I've spent more time with that boy than all you little people in this town put together, so don't you tell.. I know damn well what Jonathan needs. And thanks to you, Princess, I'm going to give it to him. In spades. But first, we've got to get him here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Harley and I were talking about Alan. You know, how nuts he is.",
        "Gus: Is that right?",
        "Jeffrey: Uh, sorry, Gus. Official business. Tammy Winslow has been missing since last night and all indications are that Nate Randall is holding her against her will.",
        "Mallet: Does Frank know about this?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. He wants to coordinate a search with you. I put in a call to my contacts at the FBI, but we've got to fly strictly under the radar on this.",
        "Mallet: Could this girl get hurt if this Randall guy is tipped off, right? Okay. I've got you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: We're going to find Tammy. Jeffrey's on the case now and the police department's involved, too.",
        "Josh: We'll get her back, Cassie. I promise.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, everything is in motion.",
        "Reva: See? It's going to be okay.",
        "Josh: Jeffrey, maybe you should stay with Cassie in case Tammy tries to get in touch with her.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.",
        "Reva: I just hope to God we can find Tammy.",
        "Josh: Well, you know Nate pretty well, Reva. What's his MO?",
        "Reva: Fear. He plays on fear. That's it.",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Reva: Water. Jonathan's terrified of water. It's what I told you, you know? About the boat rental that... Nate rented that boat in Jonathan's name. He's going to do the same thing to Jonathan that he did to Marissa!",
        "Josh: Make a murder look like an accidental drowning.",
        "Reva: I think I know where they may be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Call me if you get anything? Okay, good. Thanks.",
        "Gus: Something I can help you with?",
        "Mallet: No. Thanks, though, Gus. I think we've got this covered. I'm trying to learn how to delegate.",
        "Gus: Maybe you should learn how to do that when it involves Harley.",
        "Mallet: ( Laughs ) Why don't you give me a break?",
        "Gus: What are you guys up to?",
        "Mallet: Nothing. I've been married to the girl once; I'm not looking for round two. So, you know, she's happy with you.",
        "Gus: I'm not saying you're hitting on her or anything like that. Are you? I'm talking about the Phillip-being-alive thing.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I told you. Alan still swears...",
        "Gus: Alan is in a prison cell, locked up. He's just talking a bunch of garbage.",
        "Mallet: Mm-hmm.",
        "Gus: But you, on the other hand, you're encouraging Harley.",
        "Mallet: Okay, let me be honest with you here, okay? Harley asked me about Alan's story, okay? She's worried and she's scared that if there's even the slightest chance that Phillip's alive, that he might be a threat to the family. Okay? And I told her to leave it alone. When you saw me outside of Company at the bench the other night, I had just finished telling her, you know, \"stop imagining you're in some CSI unit and start trying on wedding dresses or something.\"",
