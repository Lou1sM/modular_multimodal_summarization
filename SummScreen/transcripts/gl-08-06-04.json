What was that about?", "Mel: I was like a nightmare. Like watching a train wreck. Harley must be in total shock. Harley, hi.", "Harley: I'm not interrupting anything, am I?", "Cassie: Never. Are you okay? What's going on?", "Harley: This is yours. I appreciate the thought, but obviously in light of everything that's happened, it wouldn't be right to keep that.", "Cassie: You don't have to do this.", "Harley: And I would have brought yours and rick's, but i didn't realize you'd be here. Can I drop it by the house later? Is that okay?", "Mel: Harley... harley, please, look. You don't have to return the gifts, okay? It's not...", "Harley: Important? No, it is. You're wrong. It's my top priority. I need to get rid of everything that reminds me of what's-his- name-- gus.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: Out for a walk?", "Gus: I'm just out.", "Jeffrey: You all right?", "Gus: Yeah. I'm hanging in there, you know?", "Jeffrey: You and I might need to have a little conversation in light of recent events.", "Gus: Right, right. Okay.", "Jeffrey: Gus, I still want you to testify at salerno's trial.", "Gus: Really?", "Jeffrey: Yeah.", "Gus: Even though I crossed the line?", "Jeffrey: Vinnie's the guy i want to put away, not you. So if I need you, where can i find you? Harley's? Right. Okay. At the spaulding's?", "Gus: Yeah. Yeah, at the spaulding's, for now.", "Jeffrey: Come on. Pick up. Pick up.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: So you know why jeffrey o'neill came to town, you know why he checked into cassie's hotel, and you know why he looks the way he looks.", "Dinah: I have some answers for you, yes. (Phone ringing)", "Edmund: Don't answer that.", "Dinah: You know, let's go somewhere private.", "Edmund: Why? Are you being followed?", "Dinah: What, are you kidding me?", "Edmund: Just talk to me. I checked into jeffrey o'neill months ago when he first came to town for just the reasons you pointed out.", "Dinah: And you stopped. Why?", "Edmund: I was satisfied that I know who he is and what he wants.", "Dinah: Well, you're very easily satisfied.", "Edmund: Is that so?", "Dinah: Mm-hmm. I mean, you found out that jeffrey the da was actually jeffrey the federal agent. But do you honestly believe that's the whole story, or the only one?", "Edmund: I let it go because i had to let it go.", "Dinah: And yet it's still around, the doubts and the suspicions.", "Edmund: Who are you and what do you want?", "Dinah: You and I have an awful lot to talk about. You have no idea. If you tell me that you never worried whether or not jeffrey o'neill was interested in cassie, then I'd have to call you a liar. And if you tell me that you're sure there's nothing more to worry about, I'd have to call you a damn fool.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: We have got to get michelle out of here right now.", "Guard #1: Look, a lockdown means that no doors get open until the all clear.", "Salerno: Now you know how i feel.", "Reva: She wasn't even supposed to be in here to begin with.", "Guard #1: Well, I can't override the system.", "Cameraman: Reva, we're going live in two minutes.", "Salerno: Looks like it's showtime. (Knocking on door)", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tony: Hey. Michelle here?", "Danny: Hey. No, she's not.", "Tony: Okay, good. I need to talk to you.", "Danny: It's not a good time, actually. Michelle's working with reva today, and they're doing a live interview, and it's going to be on any minute. So...", "Tony: Okay. Well, danny, listen. It's not going to take long, all right? Truth is I got a subpoena from o'neill today to make an appearance at salerno's trial.", "Danny: An appearance?", "Tony: Yeah. You know, the kind where you put your hand on a bible and you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cameraman: We're live in 60 seconds.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: We need to get her out. Michelle has to get out of here. Hello? We need to get michelle out of here now.", "Michelle: Reva, don't worry. Look, if you can handle being in here with him, I can handle it. I'm not scared of him.", "Salerno: You should be.", "Michelle: Oh, my...", "Salerno: Stay right where you are.", "Michelle: He's bleeding.", "Salerno: Oh, that's nothing. He'll be okay. Now our little talk can me more intimate. We can really hold...", "Reva: Look at... vinnie, listen to me. Do you want this interview to happen or not?", "Salerno: Yes, I do. I want springfield to hear my story-- the whole story.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tony: Listen, danny. This thing is... hey, the thing is you've got nothing to worry about.", "Danny: But there's stuff you know, tony.", "Tony: It's not going to make it in the courtroom, and least the stuff that will get you hurt, all right? He wants to put me on the stand and make sure that salerno goes to vailsburg for life.", "Danny: All right. Okay. Okay. What about you? Where does your immunity deal with o'neill stand?", "Tony: Hey, you know what? I guess it still stands. I don't know.", "Danny: I'll make sure. I'll talk to him and make sure it does.", "Tony: Okay.", "Danny: Now, you understand that this only covers the laws that you broke in the past, right?", "Tony: Hey, we talked about this, danny. You and I, we're not discussing this anymore. My business is my business.", "Danny: Right, right, right, right, right. You're obviously watching out for yourself, tony. Well, okay well, I guess that's it, then. Once you testify, your obligation will be over. You won't have to even think about me or michelle ever again.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Got to go.", "Cassie: Harley, wait.", "Harley: No. There's a lot more where that came from, and they've all got to go back.", "Cassie: Stop. Stop. You need to unwind a little bit. You need to not think about this for a while.", "Mel: Yeah. Why don't we go somewhere, all three of us?", "Cassie: That's a great idea. We'll go to dinner. We can have a couple drinks.", "Mel: Definitely have something to drink.", "Cassie: Come on. You deserve this. You need to give yourself a break, harley.", "Harley: Well, you know, it wouldn't be a break, though, because I would be sitting there with my nice glass of wine and my nice salad and my terrific friends, and all I'd be thinking the whole time is how pathetic i must seem to the both of you. So I know myself. I love you guys, but I've got to go. I've got to keep moving. I've got to stay busy. I'll call you.", "Mel: She shouldn't be alone.", "Cassie: No, she shouldn'T. I'm going to go after her.", "Mel: Okay.", "Cassie: I'll leave a note. Talk about a reality check.", "Mel: What do you mean?", "Cassie: Well, I've been obsessing over this woman who's been playing princesc mm%e thanks to my credit cards, and now I look at harley, and I see that things could be worse, a lot worse.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: All right, I want the full report on dinah. What's the update? I don't want excuses. Just... all right. It's a simple question.\u00d1i did she or did she not get into the united states? Work on it. Okay, more fun and games. I'm going to give you three questions, real easy ones, okay? I don't want you to think about it. Just spit out the answer, okay?", "Dinah: All right.", "Jeffrey: The names of cassie's children.", "Dinah: Rj and tammy.", "Jeffrey: Cassie's birthday.", "Dinah: May 3.", "Jeffrey: The name of cassie's personal trainer. Come on.", "Dinah: I don't remember.", "Jeffrey: Come on. Personal trainer.", "Dinah: Jocelyn. Jacqueline.", "Jeffrey: Think!", "Dinah: Jacqueline.", "Jeffrey: No, she doesn't have a personal trainer.Xd", "Dinah: Trick question.", "Jeffrey: I know it's a trick question. That's the whole point. You've got to know this stuff, I told you. How many times I got to tell you? It has to be...", "Dinah: I know, I know, i know. It's all got to be instinct, or the operation won't fly. I know. You've said it enough.", "Jeffrey: Listen, darling. You've got to know every single detail about cassie winslow's life from the most exciting to the most mundane.", "Dinah: Okay. But you know what, richard? What about the intimate, huh? You haven't asked me what side of the bed I like to sleep on, or where we were when we first kissed.", "Jeffrey: We're going to get to that.", "Dinah: Okay. Will we get to my fantasies? Because I think those are very important.", "Jeffrey: As a matter of fact, they are.", "Dinah: I wonder how convincing we'll be as lovers.", "Jeffrey: I think we're going to be fine.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ross: Jeffrey, I've been thinking about my daughter lately. I want to talk to you about dinah.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: All right. We're here. Tell me exactly what you know about jeffrey o'neill, if indeed there's anything at all.", "Dinah: You like to come off so blase, but I noticed you followed me.", "Edmund: Call it a precautionary measure.", "Dinah: Good. So you're interested in what i know. How interesting.", "Edmund: Are you hinting at some sort of deal?", "Dinah: Best way to make sure we both get what we want, which is that we keep jeffrey away from your beloved cassie.", "Edmund: Which is important to you why? Oh.T!M", "Dinah: To each his own.", "Edmund: Well, that makes it a very even playing field. I'm just having a hard time imagining, miss whoever the hell you are, that you have a hard time getting any man.", "Dinah: Really? Well, I'm going to consider that a complement, because it's not always that easy, you know. You can find a man. It's holding onto him that's difficult.", "Edmund: So I take it you've had your fair share of disappointments.", "Dinah: I actually hate that word, because I find it pale and polite compared to the pain.", "Edmund: Well, yes, I suppose it is.", "Dinah: Have you ever felt what it's like to have somebody slip away from you? I mean, you knew that you belonged together, but that didn't matter, not anymore. You did everything you could to keep them close and to keep them from looking anywhere else but your eyes, but they kept wandering farther and farther, and sooner or later, you were finding yourself doing things that you never thought you'd do. I'm guess I'm not explaining it well enough.", "Edmund: I'd say you're doing a pretty fair job.", "Dinah: No. I think that you actually have to grasp something like that only through experience. And maybe that's what you and cassie are doing right now-- experiencing something like that.", "Edmund: What's your point?", "Dinah: My point is that it could easily happen, edmund. You and I see it, because we see things like this before others do. And we can stop it if we have a deal. Do we have a deal?", "Edmund: Yes.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Okay. This stuff I can drop on my way back home. This is my \"got to be mailed back to the owner\" pile, and this is my 5th street stuff. That's good.", "Cassie: Hey.", "Harley: Hey.", "Cassie: If the pi business doesn't work out, you could always open a courier service.", "Harley: I sure could. I could start my own, because you should see the pile of gifts back at my house. But it's okay. I'll take care of all of it, no problem.", "Cassie: I think you're moving way too fast, harley.", "Harley: By wiping the slate clean?", "Cassie: Why now? You could do this in a few days, you could do it in a few months. You may regret that you've done it so soon.", "Harley: You mean regret cutting gus out of my life completely?", "Cassie: Crazier things have happened.", "Harley: That would be the craziest thing of all. No, I made one mistake with that guy. I won't be making another. I'm cutting my losses now.", "Cassie: I know he broke your heart. He also did a lot to heal your heart. You can't deny that.", "Harley: Yes. Well, you'll have to forgive me if I don't leap to his defense.", "Cassie: You had given up on love, and gus was the one to help you find it again.", "Harley: Yeah. And look where that got me, cassie.", "Cassie: I know it hurts. I know it hurts, harley.", "Harley: Yeah. It all hurts, okay? Not just what he did, but the fact that I should have seen it coming and I was completely blind to it. You know what? That's not true. I knew this was coming. I saw this coming. But I so didn't want it to happen that I pretended it wouldn'T. And deep down, I knew. I knew when he got involved with his new family that we were done for.", "Cassie: That's not how it happened.", "Harley: Yes. Cassie, he had to make a choice between me and team spaulding, and he made it, and that's a fact. The fiction is me thinking that it wouldn't affect us. We didn't stand a chance.", "Cassie: Harley, come on. Listen to me. Just because something went really wrong at the end doesn't mean it wasn't great at the beginning.", "Harley: Is that supposed to make me feel better?", "Cassie: No. It's supposed to make you realize that you didn't make a mistake, okay? You chose to love gus. And you know what? Sometimes love hurts, and sometimes things go wrong. But they're not mistakes.", "Harley: Yeah, except when they are.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tony: Look, it's not that i don't care about you and michelle.", "Reva: This is reva lewis, and I'm coming to you live form the springfield correctional facility. We're in the middle of a lockdown right now, which is why the alarms are going off and the lights are flashing, and we're not really sure exactly what the problem is. But it hasn't affected us so far, so we're just going to keep on broadcasting until they tell us to stop. We're set to do an interview, and since we can't get out and nobody else can get back in, we're just going to go ahead as planned. Vinnie salerno...", "Danny: Oh, my god.", "Reva: ...Is set to go on trial for racketeering, money laundering, drug smuggling, and attempted murder.", "Salerno: You forgot double parking with criminal intent.", "Tony: The guy wasn't worth listening to when he was the boss, danny.", "Danny: Well, michelle's there with reva.", "Tony: No, I don't think michelle is there. They have live satellite trucks, and they have a feed, right?", "Reva: The evidence against you is fairly convincing. Does that worry you?", "Salerno: No, that doesn't worry me. You know what does? The food in this place. It stinks. I've dropped five pounds the last two weeks.", "Reva: Mr. Salerno...", "Salerno: No, no. Come on, reva, come on. Call me vinnie. We're all friends here.", "Reva: I've heard the case against you characterized as a slam-dunk. That has to concern you.", "Salerno: Not really. That's just the D.A.'S office shooting off their mouths. A jury's going to try this case, not the D.A. Those 12 citizens will weigh the evidence themselves and draw their own conclusions.", "Reva: Well, I can't wait to hear their conclusions after i get up on the stand and tell them how you held a gun to my head.", "Salerno: It took you all of, what, about two minutes to slant things in your favor? But I can slant things in my favor, too.", "Reva: Is that a threat, vinnie? Because you wouldn't want our audience to think that we were in any kind of danger.", "Salerno: There's no danger here. We're all old friends. Isn't that right, michelle? Get a shot of the lovely mrs. Santos, michelle to her friends.", "Danny: Michelle... Coming up on \"guiding light\"...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: So now what, you going to exile me because I tried to do both and love you and my new family?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Yes.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: Rumor has it that warehouse explosion wasn't an accident-- it was mob-related. Is it true?", "Salerno: Maybe you'd better ask your husband danny.", "Michelle: I don't know if we're old friends, vinnie, because I don't remember you.\u00d1i", "Salerno: Well, that's too bad. I remember you, your kid and your husband.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: Get over there.", "Tony: Where, the pen?", "Danny: Vinnie lives for revenge, tony. What if he tries something with michelle?", "Tony: Hey, hey, hey. Let me go with you.", "Danny: No. Stay here. Robbie's sleeping upstairs. I'll call you when I know she's okay.", "Tony: All right, please do.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Salerno: But real life is complicated. So's this case. It's not nearly as cut and dried as you make it out to be. We have what we call mitigating factors, you know, your husband being one of them.", "Reva: Okay, can we just keep this case between us, vinnie?", "Salerno: It's just funny what gets called guilt and innocence, you know? I mean, you take michelle here, for example. She lost her memory in a horrible explosion. I can't help but wondering if maybe her husband danny has taken advantage of that.", "Michelle: What are you talking about?", "Reva: Michelle... vinnie, talk to me.", "Salerno: I'm thinking that maybe danny tried to paint his past as lily white, you know? I mean, seeing as how you can't remember any of it, I wouldn't blame him, you know, if he held a few things back.", "Michelle: He's not keeping anything from me.", "Reva: Michelle... okay, can we get back to the point here? Let's talk about your purported connection to spaulding enterprises.", "Salerno: I thought we were talking about danny santos. Let me ask you something. Is it true what I heard that when you guys met, danny was here on orders from his mother carmen to whack you?", "Reva: Okay, that's it.", "Salerno: From murder to marriage. You've got to admit, that's quite a love story.", "Michelle: You're crazy! You don't even know what you're talking about!", "Reva: We're going to take a commercial break right now, and hopefully we'll be back with more of this interview after a moment. Okay, michelle, I told you to stay out of this, and I mean it. You know what he's doing here. He knows that this interview won't win him an acquittal, so he's going after you. He's trying to trash danny and embarrass you because he's got nothing to lose.", "Michelle: Well, I'm not embarrassed. I'm just mad.", "Reva: Look! I am trying to protect you.", "Michelle: Ion't need protection. What's he going to say to hurt us?", "Salerno: That's right. Nothing. I just want to chat.", "Michelle: It's not like we can get out of here anyway, reva, and I'd really like to hear what he has to say.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ross: Ah, yes. That'll be just fine. All right. You, too. Bye-bye. Sorry. I had to take that. City council president.", "Jeffrey: That's all right. Now, listen, I'd love to have this little chat, but right now I'm kind of waiting for another appointment.", "Ross: Well, this won't take long. I just want you to take a look at this, and then get back to me.", "Jeffrey: Ross, this is your daughter's file. You had it pulled?", "Ross: I wanted to see it for myself. It's been a while since I've gone through it.", "Jeffrey: Well, let's see. Your daughter killed a man.", "Ross: O'neill...", "Jeffrey: And then she left the country to avoid arrest.", "Ross: Because I want your take on it as a prosecutor.", "Jeffrey: For what purpose, ross?", "Ross: I'm just curious how you would handle things, if for instance dinah came back to springfield. How aggressively would you pursue the case against her, seeing that there are now many different factors, circumstances, degree of intent, et cetera, et cetera.", "Jeffrey: Wait, wait, wait. Hang on. Ross, you realize that this conversation is inappropriate on about a dozen levels.", "Ross: I was a father long before I was a mayor. I'm speaking to you as a concerned parent, not as your boss. I need to know how... how to move forward with dinah.", "Jeffrey: You know where she is, don't you?", "Ross: Don't ask me questions that I can't answer.", "Jeffrey: Can't? Or won't?", "Ross: This is not about what I know, it's about what you would do as D.A., Given dinah's situation. So you read that and you think about it and you give me a call. Jeffrey?< I don't need to tell you, do I, that this stays between us?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dinah: I need to go.", "Edmund: Wait, wait. We just started.", "Dinah: I'll call you again soon.", "Edmund: Look here. You push for a meeting, insist we need to join forces to take care of the menace which is jeffrey o'neill and as soon as we shake on it, you leave. Back up your claims.", "Dinah: I have all the facts and the figures, if that's what you're worried about.", "Edmund: How nice for you. Let's hear them.", "Dinah: Not now.", "Edmund: Why not?", "Dinah: Because it's just going to have to wait. Rule number one: Don't touch me. I said I'd call.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: Another one, please.", "Bartender: So, when did you switch to whiskey?", "Gus: Do I know you?F*", "Bartender: Yeah. You used to come in here a lot, a couple years back? You were strictly a beer guy then.", "Gus: Well, here's to changing tastes. And changing times. Neither one of which I'm very good at. This is a nice place. A lot of drink and a lot of good food. It's a nice ambiance. Maybe I should have just stayed in here when I came here first and moved under the table. It's dark and quiet. And no one knows your name. A guy could get comfortable in a place like this.", "Harley: Don't bet on it.", "Gus: How about this one?", "Harley: Clean it?", "Gus: Fill it.", "Harley: Don't you think you've had enough?", "Gus: Enough in a bar?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bar: \"Bring another round.\" That's what \"bar\" stands for. All right then, tell me something, because that's what bartenders do, they give advice.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: What do you want to know?", "Gus: How do I get you back?", "Harley: Gus was lying to me.", "Cassie: I know. And it's terrible.", "Harley: Uh-huh. Well now he wants me back. He is sick with guilt.", "Cassie: But?", "Harley: But it's too little, too late. Uh-uh. I won't do it.", "\"Harley\": Sorry. Can't do it. Can't give you an answer to that one.", "Gus: Why not?", "\"Harley\": There may not be an answer.", "Gus: How can that be? How can this be happening? I mean, give me the answer, because if anybody knows the answer, it's you.", "Harley: You know, I fell in love with gus for all the right reasons. But it had to turn out that he was a spaulding, right? They ruin everything. Everything!", "\"Harley\": Do I have to tell you everything? Isn't it obvious? You couldn't figure out who to be loyal to, them or me.", "Gus: I chose both.\u00f1R", "\"Harley\": Oh, the \"why-can't- I-have-it-all\" mentality. Such ego.", "Gus: It wasn't ego. It was love.", "Harley: What I would have liked is to have never known anyone named spaulding. Or aitoro. Ever. That would have saved me a lot of grief.", "Cassie: Harley, I know what gus did was awful, but he wasn't trying to hurt you.", "Harley: I feel so much better now.", "Cassie: I'm not trying to be insensitive, but gus loves you, harley.", "Harley: He should have known, cassie. From his first day at spaulding, from the first time he was tying his tie and looking in the mirror, he should have been saying to himself, \"better be careful, gus. Don't let them change you.\"", "Gus: Love changes you. It changed me. It changed me into a gung-ho fiance and a loyal-- fiercely loyal-- son.", "\"Harley\": Love is supposed to make your priorities clear.", "Gus: So now what? You're going to exile me because I tried to do both and love you and my new family?", "\"Harley\": Yes.", "Harley: Okay, I know it is hypocritical for me to say that he should love me and not love his own family, but I don't have to stand by and watch while he covers their crimes. And I won't do it.", "Cassie: Harley? Do you love gus?", "Gus: Do you still love me?", "\"Harley\": Yeah. But that's not enough.", "Harley: But that's not enough.", "Gus: We need to talk about this.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bartender: Talk about what?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Barfly #1: My wife does the exact same thing, you know. I'll be sitting there in front of the tube, you know, watching the tv and joanie will walk in with that fish-eye look. (Laughter) and say, \"hey, another game?\"", "Barfly #2: Yeah, but when they want to watch another one of those tearjerker movies, that's okay.", "Barfly #1: That's because \"that's a story.\" It's not sports.", "Barfly #2: (Laughs) it really puts the \"why\" in \"wives.\"", "Gus: Can you just shut up?", "Barfly #1: What's your problem?", "Gus: My problem is people like you. With your baloney. Why don't you just scream it in my ear.", "Barfly #1: This is a public place, all right? You don't like it, go home.", "Gus: Idiots like you, I don't even... how do you get wives, people like you? (Laughter)", "Barfly #1: One time I caught joanie crying over-- get this-- a greeting card with a picture of a fawn on it.", "Barfly #2: (Laughs)", "Gus: You know what it is? You people... you don't deserve wives, guys like you.", "Barfly #2: Beat it.", "Gus: No, I'm not beating it. I'm not beating it. You know, you're going to have to make me.", "Barfly #1: My pleasure. You've got a big mouth for a little guy. I'm going to have to teach you some manners.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Please tell me this is not another wedding gift. I would have refused delivery, but look. There's no return address.", "Cassie: Well, is there a card in there?", "Harley: Yeah. (Gasps) I know who this is from.", "Cassie: Who?", "Harley: It's darci. This gets better and better.", "Cassie: Who are you calling?", "Harley: I'm going to call frank. Maybe he can track her down through the store where the gift came from. He's not picking up. I don't want to leave this on his voice mail.", "Cassie: What? What? What are you thinking?", "Harley: You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking it's one thing for me and gus to go down in flames, but frank and darci? Because of alex? Because she did this? That's not fair. And I hate this. Here. Do me a favor. Would you lock up, please?", "Cassie: You don't want company?", "Harley: No. There's one last thing I need to return.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: You sure it's her? Well, no, no, no, no, no. We don't want her answering the door. We just want her to stay where she is. Double check and then call me back, okay? I've got to go.", "Mel: No need to hang up. I'm on my way out.", "Jeffrey: Hello, doctor. Or should I say counselor? What's your hurry?", "Mel: Well, I'm going to pick up my daughter from daycare and then to check on a friend.", "Jeffrey: Ooh, a friend. Sounds mysterious. You're not stepping out on old rick, are you?", "Mel: No.", "Jeffrey: Just a joke, mel. So, who's the mysterious friend?", "Mel: Harley, if you must know. Cassie and I were worried about her calling off the wedding and all, so cassie went to check on her.", "Jeffrey: Good old mrs. Winslow, ever the busybody. You'd think she'd have more important things to worry about.", "Mel: I know. What is she thinking, worrying about a friend?", "Jeffrey: Well, you know, sometimes friends can be cumbersome. Sometimes they can have too many opinions and too many demands. Anyway, as far as the cooper wedding fiasco goes, I wouldn't worry about harley. She's pretty tough.", "Mel: Not as tough as she looks.", "Jeffrey: Well, if you want my advice, I would say give her some space. Anyway, enough about that. How's your sister-in-law doing?", "Mel: The same. Memory hasn't come back yet.", "Jeffrey: Well, maybe that's a good thing. Well, yeah. I mean, you know, sometimes it's nice to start over. We all want to start over sometimes. This could be the best thing that ever happened to her.", "Mel: Nice way to rationalize it, seeing that you're the one who set the whole nightmare in motion. You know, if it weren't for you, michelle would be home right now fixing her son some lunch.", "Jeffrey: Don't lay that on me. That's danny's cross to bear, not mine, okay? I did my best to keep michelle out of it.", "Mel: No. If you did your best, you would have kept danny out of it.", "Jeffrey: Okay. Whatever you say. Whatever you say, mel.", "Mel: You know, you really don't care about anyone, do you? You know, I'm going to leave right now because I doubt you want to hear what I have to say to you.", "Jeffrey: Give my regards to dr. Rick. Well, what have you got? Okay, good. Well, then, just keep an eye on her. You call me back if she so much as puts one foot out of that room. Okay. Good girl, dinah. You just stay put.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dinah: No, I want you to stay in the apartment, okay? And don't take off the wig. Just order some videos, take- out, you know? That's why I gave you the credit cards. How long? Well, however long it takes to convince certain people that dinah is safe at home. (Alarm buzzing)", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: Okay, we're back with more of the interview with vinnie salerno. ( Alarm stops buzzing) well. Looks like the emergency is over. But not this interview, because I still have a whole lot of questions to ask you and I know you've got a whole lot to say, so let's get right to it. I want to talk about an event that happened in late 2002.", "Michelle: Why don't you ask him why he has such an ax to grind with my husband. Maybe it's because he brought you down?", "Salerno: Danny santos, big hero of springfield, huh? The good guy who put the bad guy in chains and a jumpsuit.", "Michelle: Yeah, that's right.", "Salerno: Let me tell you something, cupcake. The world is not divided into the white hats and the black. There's a lot of gray area. Nobody is pure, least of all danny boy.", "Reva: It's common knowledge that danny was the head of a local crime family but he's put that all behind him.", "Salerno: You'd be surprised.", "Reva: Well, you want to tell us about something he did more recently, besides making a fool of you by putting you in here?", "Salerno: To be a convincing bad guy, you need to do bad things.", "Michelle: Can you be any more vague?", "Salerno: Oh. You want specifics, is that what it is? You want to know exactly what danny did while he was working for me? Then why didn't you just say so? Oh, I've got plenty to say. (Crashing)", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Gus?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: Harley? Is that you?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Mel: Oh, ross. I'm so sorry.", "Ross: You all right?", "Mel: Flustered. I blame it all on jeffrey o'neill.", "Ross: You know, I often wonder who got the blame for everything before jeffrey came to town.", "Mel: He made me so angry earlier that I stormed out of here leaving my purse and my cell phone and when I went to go pick up my daughter from daycare, they said rick already picked her up and they tried to call me to let me know, but of course I was too busy being annoyed with jeffrey and his whole attitude. Do you know that he refers to friendship as \"cumbersome\"?", "Ross: Really? I hadn't heard that one before.", "Mel: I am so glad that i stopped working for that man. I would hate to have to count on him for anything. Well, I've got to go. I'm sorry. Bye.", "Ross: Take care. Jeffrey, you'd better come through for me, for the sake of my little girl.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: Get back!", "Cassie: Get back!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Salerno: Well, the fact is, I've got more to say than you might want to hear, michelle.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: I need to get in there right now.", "Guard #2: You can't go in there.", "Danny: Look, I've got a pass from the producer. It's right here.", "Guard #2: That doesn't matter.", "Danny: My wife is in there. I need to get her out.", "Guard #2: They're on the air, live.", "Danny: There's A...", "Guard #2: Hey! I've got my orders. The door stays shut.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: You better put up or shut up. Not that anyone is going to take anything you say at face value, because you're a drug smuggler, a racketeer and maybe even a murderer.", "Salerno: Murderer? I don't think that particular charge made it to the list, michelle.", "Michelle: Really? Really? Because rumor has it, that warehouse explosion, the one that I was hurt in, the one that killed that girl eden, wasn't an accident. It was caused by a bomb.", "Salerno: Really?", "Michelle: Yeah. And word has it, it was mob- related. A hit. On maybe that girl, eden, maybe me, both of us. Is it true?", "Salerno: Maybe you'd better ask your husband danny.", "Michelle: What are you talking about?", "Salerno: I had absolutely nothing to do with that warehouse bomb. Danny santos did. Next, on \"guiding light.\"", "Michelle: Is it true? Did you set that explosion? I want to hear the truth. Are you responsible for putting me in that hospital bed?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alexandra: Harley, what do you really want from me?", "Harley: I want you to admit what you did to frank.", "Alexandra: I admit it. I framed frank.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: I'm here because i really need to be near you right now. It's as simple as that."], "Transcript Author": ["By Boo"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpRIjdxwOi0"}
