        "Mallet: Ow. Look at all these dead Spauldings. Not to mention the star of the show: Phillip G. What's wrong?",
        "Harley: Huh?",
        "Mallet: What's wrong?",
        "Harley: Nothing. I'm just, you know, get itchy.",
        "Mallet: Allergic to all of them, dead or alive? Oh, that's right. I'm sorry, I forgot. You've got a thing about graveyards. I totally forgot.",
        "Harley: It's not graveyards.",
        "Mallet: It's graveyards.",
        "Harley: Gosh. You don't remember? It's zombies.",
        "Mallet: Zombies.",
        "Harley: I don't have a problem with cemeteries; it's the walking dead.",
        "Mallet: I forgot. Zombies. Well, you don't have anything to worry about, Harley. Zombies eat brains, so I'll be the prime target anyway.",
        "Harley: They're not interested in a hors d'oeuvres. They want a full meal. ( Laughs ) Don't you have work to do? Come on.",
        "Mallet: Listen, I can open this up and check out Phillip's casket all by myself. So if you want to find someplace to, you know, cower in comfort.",
        "Harley: ( Laughs ) Why don't we just get it open and see if Phillip is actually in there so we can get out of here?",
        "Mallet: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Oh, yuck.",
        "Ross: Young lady, you eat that broccoli. All of it. It's good for you and very good for the baby.",
        "Dinah: You're very cute, daddy.",
        "Ross: Yes, I'm a cute daddy and you're a beautiful daughter. How are you feeling today?",
        "Dinah: Well, I'm just going to be glad when this whole thing is over, you know?",
        "Ross: Yeah, well, the third trimester is the most difficult. I mean, I wouldn't know that firsthand, but that's what they say.",
        "Dinah: It's just different. It's different than I expected it to be. I just... I'll be happy to get my life back.",
        "Ross: Well, it's funny you should mention that, because I've been thinking about taking my eldest child on a little trip after this baby is born. So you name the place, I will buy the plane tickets. Or we could take a cruise?",
        "Dinah: You're so sweet. Thank you, but I don't think I can go. I need to be here.",
        "Ross: What for?",
        "Dinah: Well, for Edmund, for one. If Cassie... her attention's going to move to the baby, so...",
        "Ross: And you believe that's going to happen?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. I have to believe it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I'm going crazy, Jeffrey, sitting around here wondering what's happening to Tammy. Okay, just please find my little girl. Can you please make sure you bring her home? Okay. Me, too. ( Knock on door )",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I just heard about Tammy. Has there been any word?",
        "Cassie: No. Not since Sandy last saw her. So, I have to stay here in case she calls.",
        "Edmund: I can't believe they left you alone.",
        "Cassie: It's all right. It's all right, I'm fine. I'm fine, so you know what, Edmund, you can just go and I can handle it all.",
        "Edmund: Cassie. Cassie, Cassie, please, just don't shut me out. I'm not divorcing the children. You know how much I care about Tammy. Please. I'll do anything. What can I do?",
        "Cassie: I don't know. I'm just terrified for my little girl, so maybe... maybe you could just sit with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Footprints, still wet. Tammy? Is that you? Tammy! Tammy! Tammy! Dead end.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: What is this place?",
        "Nate: You'll love it here. They make a lovely margarita.",
        "Tammy: So we're just going to sit here and wait?",
        "Nate: Assuming you're happier not being gagged, I would suggest that you speak only when you're spoken to. You are safe, for the moment. And since we're well away from all your friends and family, and all those others who are looking for you, I think we should try to call Jonathan again. What do you say?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: You let Sandy ride to the rescue this time, Tammy. You're his girl.",
        "Sandy: Tammy's in trouble. Your father's got her and you need to help me find her.",
        "Jonathan: Are you saying he kidnapped Tammy?",
        "Sandy: I'm saying he's got her and we've got to get her back. ( Cell phone ringing )",
        "Jonathan: Tammy?",
        "Nate: Not quite. Two more guesses.",
        "Jonathan: Where's Tammy?",
        "Nate: You two can have a little sit-down when you join us. And Jonnie, remember your manners. Don't come empty-handed. You bring me everything I need to know about that $2.3 million and where you've stashed it.",
        "Jonathan: Where are you?",
        "Nate: I'll give you a clue, Jon: We're in my happy place. Your unhappy place.",
        "Jonathan: Near the water.",
        "Nate: We're hunkered down in some boathouse, just me and your sweet little slice of white bread.",
        "Jonathan: What boathouse?",
        "Nate: Just north of Pier 54. It's on that miserable excuse for an island. Do you know the one, Jonnie? It's in the middle of the lake? Clear view in all directions so nobody can sneak up and cause any trouble.",
        "Jonathan: You want me to...",
        "Nate: Yeah. Face your fears, Jonnie.",
        "Tammy: ( Whimpers )",
        "Nate: Be a man. You get yourself out here, and soon, or the next time you see Tammy will be when her body washes up on the shore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: So, come on, push. You're not even moving it. Come on. Okay.",
        "Harley: It's bigger than I am.",
        "Mallet: We can open it from here. All right, you ready? Time to open the big box. You ready?",
        "Harley: Wait. Wait a minute.",
        "Mallet: What?",
        "Harley: Well, I just, I feel like we should, you know, say something.",
        "Mallet: Are you kidding me?",
        "Harley: No. We're going to open that thing. If we're going to open a... you know, a thing, we should... I feel like it's wrong if we don't say something.",
        "Mallet: Okay. I'll say something.",
        "Harley: Okay.",
        "Mallet: Open sesame. I'm sorry. Come on, you don't really believe Phillip's in there, do you?",
        "Harley: I don't know. Maybe. I don't know. He's not in there; somebody's in there, though. There is somebody in there.",
        "Mallet: Right, right, right. Never tick off the zombies. I got it.",
        "Harley: I wish you'd just drop the whole zombie thing. Forget about it, okay?",
        "Mallet: I've never forgotten anything about you or our marriage, so why start now? Listen, you have faced drug dealers, kidnappers, serial killers, okay?",
        "Harley: Is there a point here somewhere?",
        "Mallet: Nothing fazes you. So why are you so freaked out?",
        "Harley: Because I was married to this zombie. Okay? I've got a kid with him. Look, forget it. Just... I'll do it, okay? I'll do it. I'll say something and I'll do it and I'll take care of it, because I have to know. Right or wrong, I've got to know, right? I have to know if Phillip is actually... ( Creaking sound ) Did you hear that?",
        "Mallet: It's your imagination working overtime.",
        "Harley: No, it's not. It's not this time. I swear it's not. Go check it out. Mallet, go!",
        "Mallet: ( Sighs ) Scared out of her mind and still the bossiest woman I know.",
        "Harley: Ssh. ( Creaking sound ) Don't talk. Or you won't hear them sneaking up behind you, fool. Don't do that. Go.",
        "Mallet: Should I take this? Okay. ( Sighs ) Here, zombie, zombie... come out, come out wherever you are. Fresh brains, going cheap. Step right up. Fresh brains, going cheap. Fresh brains! What the hell is that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Dad, I know that my feelings for Edmund are a little different than what he feels for me, but I think there's a good chance that he's going to see that I have stuck by him and accepted him, and I believe in my heart I can make him happy.",
        "Ross: But can he make you happy?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. I think he can. Happier than I believed I ever could be.",
        "Ross: And you think that you know who Edmund is?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. I mean, I've seen his flaws and he's seen mine. I don't think we're afraid.",
        "Ross: Well, then why do I feel so afraid?",
        "Dinah: Because you're my daddy and that's your job.",
        "Ross: ( Laughs )",
        "Dinah: Look, you know, I can handle Edmund. We've talked about creating an incredible life together.",
        "Ross: Uh-huh. And do you think that's what he wants?",
        "Dinah: You know what? I think if I show him what he can have, I bet that he'll want it. Yeah.",
        "Ross: Well, that's not what I asked you, Dinah. Do you believe in your heart that Edmund wants to share his life with you?",
        "Dinah: I believe in us, dad.",
        "Ross: I love you.",
        "Dinah: I love you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: The phone works, Cassie. I'm sure we're going to hear something very soon.",
        "Cassie: I just can't sit here doing nothing. I've got to get out of here and find Tammy.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, please just wait.",
        "Cassie: Don't argue with me.",
        "Edmund: I'm not arguing with you. I'll drive you anywhere you want to go, it's just... fine. I'll take you anywhere.",
        "Cassie: Let's go.",
        "Edmund: I'm right behind you. Let's go. I parked by... Cassie?",
        "Cassie: They told me to wait here in case she calls. And the police are following every lead. I would have no idea where to start.",
        "Edmund: All right. Well, I know where I'm going to start. As soon as they find Nate, I'm going to have him deported to San Cristobel, to the worst prison there.",
        "Cassie: I don't even want to think about what could be happening to her.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, Nate has no reason to hurt Tammy. And she's a strong girl.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. I know. I know that.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, she's a brave, smart girl, just like her mother. Don't worry about her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Great. The other side of the lake and no boat.",
        "Nate: Suit yourself.",
        "Tammy: What is wrong with you? Don't you care about Jonathan at all, putting him through something like this?",
        "Nate: We each care in our own different ways.",
        "Tammy: You couldn't do this to him if you gave a damn. You don't know Jonathan at all.",
        "Nate: I have never once coddled that kid. And I never will. You see, fear is a thing to be swallowed. It's a weakness you have to fight and destroy for your own good.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan can't handle the water. He panics.",
        "Nate: Yeah. And he'll have to get over that. For your sake.",
        "Tammy: What if he tries and he loses it halfway? He almost went under last time, Nate. What if he drowns this time?",
        "Nate: If he drowns, that will be bad... for you. Very bad.",
        "Jonathan: ( Breathing heavily ) Screw it. ( Water splashes )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Oh, Mallet. Mallet. Mallet, wake up. Wake up.",
        "Mallet: ( Groans ) I'm up now.",
        "Harley: Okay. Come on, open your eyes. Open your eyes.",
        "Mallet: ( Groans ) Stop screaming. I've got a headache.",
        "Harley: Okay, nobody's screaming. Come on, sit up. Let me help you get up. Come here. Come on. Come on.",
        "Mallet: I think I need to... I think I need to sit here for a minute.",
        "Harley: Okay. That's a good idea. You stay here. I'm going to call 911.",
        "Mallet: We are 911. Relax. ( Groans ) What happened?",
        "Harley: That statue hit that head.",
        "Mallet: Oh, that's a new one.",
        "Harley: No. I think someone pushed it.",
        "Mallet: It's a crumbly old tomb. Maybe we jarred it or something.",
        "Harley: I don't think so.",
        "Mallet: Who knows that we're here?",
        "Harley: The zombies. The living dead.",
        "Mallet: Uh-oh. Here they come.",
        "Harley: ( Gasps )",
        "Gus: Well, hello. How's the grave-robbing business?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Edmund, if you're just trying to get close to me and you're using this situation...",
        "Edmund: I'm not, Cassie. I'm not. Please know how much Tammy means to me.",
        "Cassie: I've been so focused on the baby that I haven't really paid much attention to her.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, Tammy knows how much you love her.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, but there's a big difference between love and attention. Tammy's just so grown up. More grown up than me, most of the time. I guess I just assumed she'd be okay, you know? I didn't even know she was missing until Reva told me. Some mother. I just can't lose her.",
        "Edmund: You won't, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: I can't. What is that monster doing to her? Tammy has so many things to do in her life, so many dreams, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: And you will see all of them. You will see every single one of those dreams coming true, Cassie. Every single one of them, every year.",
        "Cassie: Do you think so? Do you really think so?",
        "Edmund: There is no doubt in my mind.",
        "Cassie: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: Still no sign of our boy out here. Not even a ripple.",
        "Tammy: Why should Jonathan bother to swim out here when we can hardly stand being around one another?",
        "Nate: Princess, don't start that. We both know that you two have got the itch for each other.",
        "Tammy: Shut up!",
        "Nate: Kissing cousins. A little bit more than kissing from what I hear.",
        "Tammy: Stop it! Ugh!",
        "Nate: Relax. Look, I'm not judging you. These things happen. I mean, it's not like the pair of you were brought up side-by- side, is it?",
        "Tammy: He doesn't care about me nearly as much as you think he does.",
        "Nate: Well, knowing him as well as I do, I think he cares a hell of a lot more than you think he does, princess.",
        "Tammy: There's only one reason he bothered with me in the first place, okay? Because he came here to destroy our whole family. Did you send him?",
        "Nate: Jonnie found Springfield all by himself. I followed him. So that little connection between you, that's all his own work. Incidentally, that's the point at which he started getting soft on me.",
        "Tammy: Ow. Ow, my wrist. I think I'm bleeding.",
        "Nate: Yeah, didn't I tell you to stop pulling against the cuffs? And now you're surprised?",
        "Tammy: Ow. Can we just... just take it off, just for a minute? Please, just... let me clean it off and wrap it up. Where am I going to go?",
        "Nate: You know how upset I'll get if you did try to go. I mean, I would have to punish you.",
        "Tammy: Oh, yeah. I understand.",
        "Nate: A little first aid kit, there.",
        "Tammy: ( Breathing heavily )",
        "Nate: I don't know, rub it or something and I'll see if I've got any bandages.",
        "Tammy: ( Yells ) ( Whimpers ) ( Breathing heavily )",
        "Nate: You're feeling frisky, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: ( Screams )",
        "Nate: How about now?",
        "Tammy: ( Gurgling )",
        "Jonathan: Hey! Get your hands off of her!",
        "Tammy: Jonathan!",
        "Jonathan: Get them off of her!",
        "Tammy: ( Crying )",
        "Nate: Hello, son. How was your swim?",
        "Tammy: ( Hyperventilating )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Do I have to tell you what kind of sentence you can get for desecrating a grave?",
        "Harley: No. Um... um... desecration would actually involve the tomb being open. This was, I think, just minor vandalism. Wouldn't you say?",
        "Mallet: How did you find us, man?",
        "Gus: Well, first of all, you told Lizzie you wanted to exhume Phillip's body and she said no, but I know better than that. I know that wouldn't stop you.",
        "Mallet: Hey, man, were you the one that whacked me with the gargoyle?",
        "Gus: Say what?",
        "Mallet: Uh-huh.",
        "Harley: We made a conscious decision to handle this this way because we felt it would cause the least amount of pain.",
        "Mallet: So much for that.",
        "Harley: Emotional pain. For your family. I figured, you know, we'd do this, I'd get my answers, keep it quiet. Nobody gets hurt...",
        "Gus: Sorry. What, you said you did this for me?",
        "Harley: I did it for you. I was thinking of you the whole time.",
        "Gus: So that's why you feel you've got to sneak around behind my back and poke around in my brother's grave? Is that what you're saying?",
        "Harley: Okay...",
        "Gus: And the whole time I'm thinking, \"Oh, my goodness, she is planning our wedding. Isn't that sweet of her?\"",
        "Harley: Okay...",
        "Gus: I'm so stupid.",
        "Harley: Okay...",
        "Gus: I'm an idiot.",
        "Harley: Okay, no, no. I was sneaking around, definitely. Not good. And I'm sorry for that, but you know, it's done. Let's be honest, it's done, and the point is, we're here. What would it hurt to take a peek?",
        "Gus: This is your ex-husband, for crying out... I'm looking at another ex- husband over here!",
        "Mallet: She's got a right to look.",
        "Gus: Listen, you can just shut up right now, okay?",
        "Harley: You can't yell at him. Shh. The man has a coma, here, okay? He got hit by the gargoyle. He could be dead.",
        "Gus: I remember having a...",
        "Harley: Did you do that?",
        "Gus: I had a conversation with you.",
        "Harley: Like you've never broken any rules...",
        "Gus: I had a conversation with you at home about you wanting a normal life, you wanted to have a peaceful life with a big-screen television. Remember that? Haven't you had enough of this?",
        "Mallet: Hey, hey, hey. Guys, guys, guys!",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Mallet: I don't feel so good.",
        "Harley: Oh, God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You really think Tammy's going to be okay?",
        "Edmund: Of course I do. Of course I do. She's coming home, Cassie. She's fine, she's safe. She'll be... ( Knock on door ) Let me get it, please, Cassie.",
        "Dinah: Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Dinah.",
        "Dinah: I didn't expect to see you here.",
        "Cassie: What have you heard?",
        "Dinah: About what?",
        "Edmund: About Nate. Jonathan's father. He has Tammy and no one knows where they are.",
        "Dinah: Cassie, you must be ready to scream. Just in time for that shoulder to cry on, huh? You know, Cassie, if there's anything I can do to help, just count me in, all right? We'll get through this together.",
        "Edmund: Yes, we certainly will. So if anything pops to mind, Dinah, we'll give you a call. You'll be the first one we will call, but I think Cassie right now doesn't need anything.",
        "Cassie: No, it's fine. I'm glad Dinah's here because at least I know the baby's okay.",
        "Dinah: Well, I would be happy to stay, so I mean, that's not a problem.",
        "Cassie: That's great. I'm going to... I need to go out and get some air, so if you guys can listen for the phone, I'm just going to be right on the porch.",
        "Edmund: If you'd like, I...",
        "Cassie: No, I really am okay.",
        "Dinah: Look at you. Such a hero.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I can't believe it. You swam all this way.",
        "Nate: Now, hold on! Just give the boy a minute to dry off and catch his breath, will you? Just don't get him all riled up. Look at you. Huh? You did what had to be done, Jonnie. You swallowed hard and you did the job. That's my boy.",
        "Jonathan: Not your boy.",
        "Nate: All right. No. No, you proved that today. You are the man I raised you to be and I am... I'm very proud.",
        "Tammy: Oh, leave him alone!",
        "Jonathan: Are you all right?",
        "Tammy: I'm fine.",
        "Nate: Good girl. All right, Jonnie, that's the answer you were looking for?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, and you got what you wanted, too. Me. I'm here. She's got nothing to do with this so let her go, damn it!",
        "Nate: All right. Watch your language. You just start thinking before you open that big mouth of yours, all right?",
        "Jonathan: Let her go.",
        "Nate: As a favor to you, I have been very gentle and very friendly. Go on. Tell him. This package was handled with care. We spent the time getting to know each other.",
        "Jonathan: Why? Why? She means nothing to you.",
        "Nate: Now, what kind of dad would I be if I didn't show interest in knowing the young lady who stole my little boy's heart?",
        "Jonathan: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Nate: Oh, J-J-Jonnie. No.",
        "Jonathan: She's just a girl. It's not like she's important to me.",
        "Nate: All right. So, you just felt like risking your life by swimming out here to see me. No, Jonnie, you proved that she's important to you. The question is: How important is little Tammy to you, kid?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
