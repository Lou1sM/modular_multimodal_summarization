        "Dinah: Oh, cassie, cassie, cassie. You're such a good mommy. Why don't they \r\nvote you mommy of the year, huh? That's not... (laughs) oh, look who's here: \r\nMr. Hero. Can he save the day? Huh? Run, jeffrey, run. Run. Or the world will be \r\nshort one princess. (Planter scrapes) ",

        "Marina: Yeah, it was empty. ",
        "Reva: You know, I may know someone else who has seen him. (Cell phone rings) ",
        "Sandy: Bonjour, reva. ",
        "Reva: Have you seen your brother recently? ",
        "Sandy: As a matter of fact, he's right here at company. ",
        "Reva: Well, we're on our way over. Don't let him leave, okay? We've got some \r\nbig news for him. ",
        "Sandy: I'm on it. ",
        "Ross: So your dad tells me that you might get another chance with the pros.\r\n",
        "Shayne: Well, I did throw for a pro scout today, yeah. ",
        "Ross: Well, good. That's right. You also said that you had something else on \r\nyour mind, something that might risk the?O\u00fa life that you've worked so hard to \r\nget back. ",
        "Shayne: I do. And I don't think my parents are going to be too happy about \r\nit. ",
        "Harley: Frank. I'm sorry. ",
        "Frank: Well, the tip was good, but she was nowhere to be found. ",
        "Buzz: New york city is a great place in which to get lost. ",
        "Frank: Or to lose someone. ",
        "Buzz: You want something to eat? ",
        "Frank: No, that'S... I'm not hungry, pop. Thanks anyway. ",
        "Harley: Look at us. A week ago, we had everything. Now the woman you love has \r\nleft town, your woman is in jail and my guy is... whatever. ",
        "Buzz: What is your guy? ",
        "Harley: Nothing. Never mind. ",
        "Frank: No, no, no. What were you going to say? ",
        "Harley: Nothing. Just, you know, he's gone, too. ",
        "Frank: And how do you know that? ",
        "Harley: Because in a moment of weakness, I went looking for him. But then I \r\nrealized that actually my guy, the guy that i love, he disappeared the moment he \r\nset foot in that house. ",
        "Buzz: The house of spaulding, where loves goes to die. ",
        "Harley: Exactly. And I for one am sick of being hurt by those people, and I'm \r\nnot going to let them hurt anybody in my family ever again.\u00f1 ",
        "Alan: Well, phillip, you couldn't have picked a worse time to take a \r\nvacation. ",
        "Phillip: Really? I thought my timing was pretty good for once. ",
        "Alan: Your aunt alexandra is in jail. Gus has run off to lick his wounds, and \r\nI have been stuck in this house with olivia. ",
        "Phillip: You have my sympathies. ",
        "Alan: I was so desperate to talk to a family member, i called amanda. ",
        "Phillip: How is she doi?@<\u00d1 >",
        "Alan: She wasn a rush, going to italy or something. ",
        "Phillip: A romantic getaway with good old roger? ",
        "Alan: Well, as a matter of fact, she didn't even mentionko roger. ",
        "Phillip: Oh. Well, maybe she finally got smart and dumped him. ",
        "Alan: Well, we would be the last to know about that. ",
        "Phillip: Yeah. Oh. I have something for you. Here, look at this. This might \r\ncheer you up; idid me. My divorce is final. ",
        "Alan: Well, congratulations. ",
        "Phillip: Thank you. ",
        "Alan: Shall I call the movers? ",
        "Phillip: No. Let's let olivia handle that. Let her think that she's in \r\ncontrol. ",
        "Alan: Oh. ",
        "Olivia: It's offic8+zv\u00f1t I'm single yet again. ",
        "Bill: You okay? ",
        "Olivia: I'm fine.Rgf my moment of feeling like a failure is over. What I want \r\nnow is success. ",
        "Bill: Ah. Which means? ",
        "Olivia: Which means I'm ready to go forward with our plan. ",
        "Bill: That's funny, I don't remember having a plan. ",
        "Olivia: All right, then. It's my plan. Look, phillip gave me a generous \r\nsettlement in this divorce-- more than I could ever possibly need-- but what I \r\nwant is to take everything he has. ",
        "Cassie: Talk about deja vu. ",
        "Jeffrey: Aryou all right? ",
        "Cassie: Fine. ",
        "Jeffrey: Are you all right, little buddy? Good. ",
        "Cassie: This saving my life thing is getting a little ridiculous. Why are you \r\nalways there? You can let go of me now. ",
        "Jeffrey: Right. Okay, sorry. ",
        "Cassie: I always thought those pots were too close to the edge. ",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, maybe. ",
        "Cassie: You don't think this was an accident. ",
        "Edmund: What happened? ",
        "Cassie: Oh, um, a planter fell. It was too close to the edge. ",
        "Edmund: Are you and rj all right? ",
        "Cassie: Yeah, we're okay. Thanks that jeffrey was here. Rj, say thank you to \r\nmr. O'neill. ",
        "Rj: Thank you. ",
        "Jeffrey: You're welcome, little buddy. Are you sure you're okay? Okay, good. \r\nI'm going to go upstairs and check things out up there. Take care of these two, \r\nhuh? ",
        "Edmund: Right. Look, cassie, why don't you wait here with mrs. Chitwood. I'm \r\ngoing to look around the grounds, all right? ",
        "Cassie: Would you like to go to the lake and feed the ducks? Okay, why don't \r\nyou go with mrs. Chitwood. ",
        "Mrs. Chitwood: It's one of our favorite things, isn't it, rj? ",
        "Cassie: And please don't let him out of your sight. ",
        "Mrs. Chitwoodnot for a second. ",
        "Dinah: Wowee. This could have hurt. ",
        "Edmund: Yeah. It narrowly missed cassie and her son. ",
        "Dinah: Well, that's terrible. ",
        "Edmund: But jeffrey o'neill saved the day. Again. ",
        "Dinah: He's good at that, huh? ",
        "Edmund: What? Saving people? ",
        "Dinah: Being there at just the right time to do the saving. ",
        "Shayne: Hey. ",
        "Josh: Hey. ",
        "Shayne: I was just on my way back to the park. ",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, we came to find you. Your dad has something to tell you.\r\n",
        "Shayne: I made it, didn't I? ",
        "Josh: Yes, you did. Congratulations. ",
        "Reva: Congratulations. You're a star. ",
        "Marina: I'm so proud of you. You did it again, lewis. ",
        "Sandy: Way to go, shayne-O. ",
        "Shayne: Thanks, everybody. I don't know what to say. ",
        "Josh: Well, you can... you can be happy. That's okay. ",
        "Shayne: Yeah, I am. It's amazing. ",
        "Reva: Great. Then milkshakes all around, on me. ",
        "Ross: Go ahead, shayne. They'll understand. I believe shayne has something to \r\ntell all of you. ",
        "Shayne: Well, I know I've been hinting around this a lot. Baseball, it's not \r\nwhat I want anymore. ",
        "Alan: You know, ever since you left ravenwood, phillip, you've been a man \r\nwith a purpose, with olivia and with spaulding. ",
        "Phillip: Well, you know, being locked up will give you time to plan for the \r\nfuture. ",
        "Alan: I know that feeling very well. ",
        "Phillip: I know you do. And it does... it's incredible. I feel as though my \r\nlife truly began again. I walked out of that place a new man, with a very clear \r\nperspective. ",
        "Alan: You know, I'm glad to see you're focused again, son. Because I have to \r\ntell you, at one point, I was very worried about you. ",
        "Phillip: Well, you don't need to worry anymore, about me or the company. ",
        "Alan: Well, we do have some ground to gain, you know. ",
        "Phillip: Oh, that's true. ",
        "Alan: In large part due to this federal probe. ",
        "Phillip: It was a lot of things. My little stint in the hospital didn't help. \r\nAlex's indiscretions. But it doesn't matter. I don't care what the reasons are. \r\nAll I care about is solving the problems. ",
        "Alan: Well, I'm thrilled you're taking this hands-on approach, phillip, but \r\nremember. This is not the first time we've been rocked by scandal. And we've \r\nbounced back before. ",
        "Phillip: But never from something like this. No, we're a joke. No one \r\nrespects us anymore. ",
        "Alan: I'm not sure I agree with that. ",
        "Phillip: Well, maybe \"respect\" is not the right word. No one fears us \r\nanymore. There was a time when crossing a member of this family was like \r\nsticking a loaded gun in your mouth. When even challenging one of us meant that \r\nyou and everything that you cared about would be reduced to rubble. ",
        "Alan: I miss those days. ",
        "Phillip: Think about what just happened at that wedding. Frank cooper stuck a \r\ngun in your face in our home. Alex was arrested. Gus was humiliated. In our \r\nhome. And the coopers walked away without a scratch. Fear, alan. We're going to \r\nhave that again, and we're going to take back what's rightfully ours. ",
        "Alan: What's that? ",
        "Phillip: Well, we're going to start with the town that we used to own: \r\nSpringfield. ",
        "Bill: Well, enjoy yourself, olivia. In fact, knock yourself out. But me? I \r\nhave no interest in helping you take down good old phillip. ",
        "Olivia: Oh, come on. Where's your sense of fun? Your lust for adventure? ",
        "Bill: Revenge is not my idea of a good time. Okay? I'm more of a success guy. \r\nBesides, my mom and daddy wouldn't approve. ",
        "Olivia: That's sweet. Still worried about what other people think, huh? ",
        "Bill: Not as worried as I am about trusting you. ",
        "Olivia: And yet, I'm the one who's been loyal to you. I came to you when you \r\nwere running lewis. I'm still here even after your uncle josh let you go. ",
        "Bill: I quit. ",
        "Olivia: Did they fight to keep you? ",
        "Bill: Well, you know, it wouldn't have mattered. Besides, none of that has \r\nanything to do with you and me. ",
        "Olivia: Yes, it does. You have an opportunity to leave lewis construction in \r\nthe dust. Think of the team we could form. ",
        "Bill: Oh. Olivia, you have no interest in forming a team, or success or \r\nanything but revenge, and as much as I want to be a player in this town, I have \r\nno interest in getting involved in this vendetta of yours against the spauldings. \r\nSo, unless you have anything else to say... ",
        "Olivia: Revenge? Success? What difference does it make, as long as you get \r\nwhat you want? At least I'm not afraid of the fight. ",
        "Edmund: Why are you here? ",
        "Dinah: I was watching jeffrey from afar. ",
        "Edmund: Did you see what happened to cassie? ",
        "Dinah: No. But the idea of jeffrey playing superman cracks me up. ",
        "Edmund: Well, I'm glad to know you find this all so funny. ",
        "Dinah: (Laughs) you don't think that this was an accident, do you? Do you \r\nthink that cassie is in some kind of danger? Pardon me. I'm sorry. You barely \r\nknow me and I'm already prying into your girlfriend's life. ",
        "Edmund: Wait, wait, wait. Your friend jeffrey o'neill seems to think she's in \r\ndanger. It's why he's taken such a personal interest in her case. ",
        "Dinah: Well, it's a dirty job. Somebody has to do it, right? ",
        "Edmund: Well, he's the district attorney. I suppose it is his job. ",
        "Dinah: Didn't his job end when he arrested that mobster? Wasn't he scheduled \r\nto leave town? ",
        "Edmund: Yes, but then he started to help cassie. ",
        "Dinah: And he decided to stick around. Interesting. ",
        "Cassie: Did you really expect to find someone here? ",
        "Jeffrey: Do me a favor, okay? Stop bugging me, make yourself useful and see \r\nif anything is out of place around here. ",
        "Cassie: Is this about the identity thieves? Did you get a new lead? Are they \r\nin town, jeffrey? ",
        "Jeffrey: Look, there's nothing new, cassie. Please, just help me out, would \r\nyou? ",
        "Cassie: Stop keeping things from me! I don't know why that planter fell, but \r\nI'm not the only one who could have been hurt. Rj could have been hurt, too, and \r\nI need to know what's going on here. ",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, take it easy. Nothing happened. Rj is fine, not a bruise on \r\nhim. ",
        "Cassie: Comfort's cheap. I want answers. ",
        "Shayne: I want to give something back. And I need to go somewhere to do that. \r\nTo make up for all the gifts that I've been given. ",
        "Reva: What are you talking about? ",
        "Ross: Maybe I can help, because shayne has certainly done his homework. He \r\nknew all about the program i started, which is going to benefit springfield's \r\nsister city, which you may or may not know is sarajevo, capital of bosnia. And \r\nhe has asked me to sponsor his work. ",
        "Josh: His work? ",
        "Ross: Yeah, he'S... shayne, why don't you tell them? ",
        "Shayne: I've decided I'm going to start up a youth program. It's going to be \r\nsort of like a mini peace corps. ",
        "Reva: In bosnia? ",
        "Shayne: Mom, I'm going to be okay. I'll be okay. ",
        "Josh: You've been thinking about this for a long time, haven't you, son? ",
        "Shayne: Yeah, I have. ",
        "Ross: He's given this a lot of thought, and believe me, he's going to help a \r\nlot of people, do a lot of good for them and I'll do everything I can to help.\r\n",
        "Reva: Ross, no offense, but... ",
        "Ross: None taken. I know you have a lot to discuss. ",
        "Sandy: Well, I am beyond impressed, man. I don't know that I could do that. \r\nYou're giving up a lot. ",
        "Shayne: That's what makes it so meaningful. So important. Mom, dad, I've got \r\nto... ",
        "Josh: No, it's okay. Go ahead. ",
        "Reva: Can we let him do this? ",
        "Josh: I don't really know that we have any choice, reva. ",
        "Ross: Well, I'm glad to see that you're all surviving. What about darci? ",
        "Frank: Darci is still gone, ross. ",
        "Ross: Frank, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for you guys, too. ",
        "Harley: Don't worry, we're all better off. So when can frank have his job \r\nback? ",
        "Frank: Harley? ",
        "Harley: What? Haven't you paid enough? ",
        "Ross: Well, we have a bit of a problem in that he pulled a gun on alan \r\nspaulding in front of 35 or 40 witnesses. ",
        "Buzz: Alan pushed him too far. The whole family did. ",
        "Frank: Look, I think we all know that I made a big mistake. But you also know \r\nthat I'm damn good at my job. ",
        "Ross: Yeah, I know that, frank, but it's going to take some time, and you \r\nshould use this time, this little break that you have, to get things together. \r\nAnd for heaven's sakes, stay away from the spauldings, would you? Don't give \r\nalan any more ammunition. ",
        "Harley: I couldn't agree more, by the way. ",
        "Ross: Excuse me, I have to check in with city hall. ",
        "Frank: That's great. I don't know what's going to take more time, getting my \r\njob back or finding darci. ",
        "Buzz: Are you going to be okay with the bills, the rent and everything? ",
        "Harley: You know what? He's going to be fine. ",
        "Buzz: You're sure about that? ",
        "Harley: I'm sure. Because he's moving in with me. ",
        "Buzz: He is? ",
        "Frank: I am? ",
        "Harley: You are. Hey, I said we're going to build a bunker. Let's do it, \r\nright? As a matter of fact, why don't you both move in? ",
        "Alan: Well, you've piqued my curiosity. What exactly do you have planned? ",
        "Phillip: I'll do you one better. I'll show you. ",
        "Olivia: You're home. ",
        "Phillip: Yes. Safe and sound. Emma is taking a nap. ",
        "Olivia: Yeah, I know. I peeked in. You know, for a while I was afraid you \r\nweren't going to bring her back. ",
        "Phillip: No. She missed you. ",
        "Olivia: Well, thanks for saying that. Island life must have treated you well. \r\nYou're in a good mood. ",
        "Phillip: I was just about to say the same thing about you. ",
        "Alan: Yes, you know, a good divorce brings out that old inner glow in olivia.\r\n",
        "Olivia: Do you mind? I'm trying to have a conversation. ",
        "Alan: Well, as was I, until i was interrupted. ",
        "Olivia: So sorry. Look, I just want you to know that I'm looking for a house, \r\nor maybe I'll take a room at the beacon. ",
        "Phillip: Whatever you want, but there's no rush. ",
        "Olivia: Well, I appreciate that, but I'm devoted to finding a place to live. \r\nAnd, you know, business is going to have to take a back seat, at least for a \r\nlittle while. ",
        "Phillip: I've been thinking the same thing. ",
        "Olivia: Really? ",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Olivia: Well, good. Maybe emma could use some time with both her parents. I \r\ndon't know, maybe I'll take up a hobby. Golf. ",
        "Phillip: (Laughs) golf. ",
        "Olivia: (Laughs) what? ",
        "Phillip: I haven't played golf... I haven't played in a long time. I'll have \r\nto get back to it sometime. It's very relaxing. ",
        "Olivia: Yeah? ",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Olivia: See you on the fairway? ",
        "Phillip: Don't forget to yell \"fore.\" You don't want to hit anybody. ",
        "Olivia: Oh, god forbid. ",
        "Alan: (Chuckles) she's coming after us. ",
        "Phillip: Oh, I hope so. ",
        "Dinah: Gosh, this thing could have really hurt someone. ",
        "Edmund: What were you implying just now? ",
        "Dinah: Sorry? ",
        "Edmund: With jeffrey o'neill not leaving town. What were you implying? ",
        "Dinah: Oh. Uh, it just... it seems odd to me that the da would be spending so \r\nmuch time on this case. Why can't the police handle it? ",
        "Edmund: Well, jeffrey o'neill has international connections. ",
        "Edmund: Listen, you obviously have something to say. Why don't you just come \r\nout and say it? ",
        "Dinah: Well, edmund, you and I both know that if jeffrey wants something, he \r\nwill do anything to get it. And if cassie is something that he wants... ",
        "Edmund: Well, are you saying that he staged this accident? ",
        "Dinah: Well, I don't know. I didn't see it. ",
        "Edmund: (Laughs) well, that's ridiculous. That's ridiculous. I mean, the \r\njeffrey o'neill i know, I can't stand, I despise him, but even this is beneath \r\nhim. ",
        "Dinah: Well, sure. I , you'robly rit. I mean, he's probably changed. He's \r\nprobably a better man. A selfless, caring, decent man. Have a good day, edmund.\r\n",
        "Jeffrey: So, you need to be prepared for anything. You got lucky this time, \r\nif this accident wasn't, indeed, an accident. ",
        "Cassie: How did they get in here? Where did they go? ",
        "Jeffrey: I don't know. We're going to figure that out, cassie.I] ",
        "Cassie: But what if this was a warning? What if it was an attempt? What if it \r\nwas just the first attempt? ",
        "Jeffrey: Well, then, I'm going to make sure that there's not a second \r\nattempt, okay? ",
        "Cassie: Okay, thank you, but you know, you almost didn't get here in time.\r\n",
        "Jeffrey: Don't even think about that. ",
        "Cassie: I have to think about it, because you said that you were going to \r\nprotect me, but you almost didn't make it. ",
        "Jeffrey: Does this mean you want me to stay closer to you now? ",
        "Cassie: To keep my kids safe, yes, you bet. I mean, you need to stay as close \r\nas you can. ",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Well, in that case, you've got some potting soil in your hair.\r\n",
        "Coming up on \"guiding light.\" ",
        "Cassie: But if I or the children are in danger, it doesn't hurt to have the \r\nda on your side. ",
        "Edmund: Of course not. Unless, of course, he's the danger. ",
        "Marina: I'm proud of shayne, too, but I don't think I can do this. I don't \r\nthink I can let go. ",
        "Shayne: Listen, I want you to go with me. Oprah: What really happens inside \r\ndetox, ",
        "Edmund: Tell me something, mr. O'neill. How is it that you happen to be \r\naround every time cassie is in trouble? ",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I don't know what you're insinuating, edmund, but I just saved \r\nyour girlfriend. Maybe you should be more grateful. ",
        "Edmund: Oh, believe me, I am. ",
        "Jeffrey: Well, those questions aren't how you show it. I'm going to go back \r\ndownstairs, look around. ",
        "Cassie: What was that? ",
        "Edmund: Jeffrey o'neill can't play sir galahad without a damsel in distress, \r\nwhich is exactly where you come in. ",
        "Buzz: Why don't we let this idea sink in before we make any decisions? ",
        "Harley: What is to sink in, dad? We can do... we can do this together. We can \r\nhelp frank get his job back together. We can help darci come home. We can help \r\neach other move on, together. Right? I mean, hey, the spauldings all live up in \r\nthat mausoleum and they're not even half the family we are. ",
        "Buzz: Well, you got that right. ",
        "Phillip: Well, I don't know why anybody would take it personally. It's \r\nbusiness.\u00e7\u00f3 it's just business, pure and simple. So let's move on this now. ",
        "Alan: You were about to tell me something before I was so rudely interrupted \r\nby our ex, olivia? ",
        "Phillip: You're going to love it. It's all your dreams come true. ",
        "Reva: I don't even know what to say? I mean, bosnia? I don't even think I \r\ncould find it on the map. We might as well be sending him to war. ",
        "Josh: It's safer there than it used to be, reva. I mean, if ross really \r\nthought it was dangerous... ",
        "Reva: Ross doesn't know. No one knows, joshua. I mean, it's just... ",
        "Josh: Reva, don't go there, okay? ",
        "Reva: I mean, I don't even know what to think. When he was talking about \r\ntrying to figure out what he wanted to do with his life, I thought he was \r\ntalking about college or a job. But this? Going to that place? I mean, what we \r\nread about? I mean, he could... I just... he's our baby. ",
        "Josh: He's over 18 years old. We can't stop him if this is what he wants to \r\ndo. ",
        "Sandy: Excuse me, but, um, what's wrong with you two? ",
        "Shayne: Wait. Would you just wait? I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you \r\nfirst. I wanted to. ",
        "Marina: You didn't even tell me. ",
        "Shayne: I know, I just... i wanted to... I needed a chance to think about it, \r\nby myself, without anybody else weighing in. ",
        "Marina: My opinion obviously didn't matter anyway. I obviously don't matter.\r\n",
        "Shayne: That's not true. That's not true. Listen, I want you to go with me.T(\r\n",
        "Dinah: All right, look. I want you to relax, okay? Take a little snack break. \r\nI made these myself. ",
        "Bill: What the heck are you doing? ",
        "Dinah: Well, you were acting like mom a little bit ago. Now it's my turn to \r\ntake care of you. Plus, you know, I don't see a whole lot of women hanging \r\naround here doing these things for you. Unless that olivia chick counts. ",
        "Bill: Well, I couldn't imagine that olivia chick getting me a tasty little \r\ntreat like this. ",
        "Dinah: No. She doesn't seem the type. ",
        "Bill: Besides, we're just friends. Sort of. ",
        "Dinah: Oh. All right. Well, that's cool. I've known girls like that. They \r\njust... they want more, all the time. ",
        "Bill: Well, what she wants is for me to help her take down the spauldings, \r\nso... ",
        "Dinah: Really? (Laughs) ",
        "Bill: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Dinah: (Laughs) you're taking on the spauldings? ",
        "Bill: Who, me? Heck, no. Uh-uh. I want a lot of things, but that is one \r\nhornet's nest I have no interest in stirring up. I mean, why would I? ",
        "Dinah: You know what, bill? When I left town? ",
        "Bill: Mm-hmm? ",
        "Dinah: You know, you were the smartest guy in springfield, bar none. \r\nAbsolutely. ",
        "Bill: Still holds true. ",
        "Dinah: Yeah. And now that I'm back, it's got me wondering... ",
        "Bill: Yeah? ",
        "Dinah: How did you get so stupid? ",
        "I love that we have this room ",
        "all to ourselves. ",
        "I think I want to stay all ",
        "night. ",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I'm afraid we ",
        "really have to go. ",
        "Dinah: No. ",
        "No, no, no, no. ",
        "Jeffrey: If we don't go, our ",
        "car might turn into a pumpkin ",
        "and we don't want that, do we? ",
        "Dinah: (Laughs) ",
        "oh, I don't want a night like ",
        "this to end. ",
        "I don'T. ",
        "It makes me wonder sometimes if ",
        "there isn't room for two cassie ",
        "winslows in the world. ",
        "Jeffrey: Dinah? ",
        "Dinah: I'm just kidding. ",
        "I'm kidding. ",
        "Come on, stop looking at me ",
        "like that. ",
        "Come on, before I lose my glass ",
        "slipper. ",
        "Ross: If you're thinking of going into gardening, my advice is to keep a day \r\njob. creating these situations where he has to save me. It just happens and he's \r\nthere. ",
        "Edmund: It just happens and he happens to be there, every single time. ",
        "Cassie: Oh, edmund, look. I know it's weird. ",
        "Edmund: Well, maybe it's more than just weird, cassie. ",
        "Cassie: I don't like needing jeffrey o'neill, okay? But if I or the children \r\nare in danger, it doesn't hurt to have the da on your side. ",
        "Edmund: Of course not. Unless, of course, he's the danger. ",
        "Ross: Did you get a chance to look at the file? ",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. Yeah, I looked at it, ross. Dinah shot a man in cold blood. \r\nAre you sure you want to go to bat for this girl? ",
        "Ross: This \"girl\" is my daughter, who at a very young age made a terrible \r\nmistake. For an instant, she lost control. Her life is worth redeeming. ",
        "Jeffrey: Well, like I said, i looked at the file, front and back, okay? And \r\nthe case against her is... well, it's rock solid, ross. I mean, there's forensic \r\nevidence, there's eyewitness testimony, there's motive. It's a dream case for \r\nany prosecutor. ",
        "Ross: Yeah, I know it could be. ",
        "Jeffrey: Now, if I were the heartless jerk that everyone seems to think I am \r\naround here, then I would probably try to persuade you to bring her in, and then \r\nI would try to convince you that I would cut her a deal. But you wouldn't buy \r\nthat, would you? ",
        "Ross: Uh, no. ",
        "Jeffrey: Good. Because if dinah ever sets foot in this town, I will put her \r\non trial for murder, and a jury will make sure that she spends the rest of her \r\nshort life on death row. ",
        "Dinah: Listen to me. You want to make a name for yourself, right? So, how are \r\nyou going to do that if you're going to play it safe? ",
        "Bill: All right, look. This has nothing to do with playing it safe. It's just \r\nI don't want to do it olivia's way, that's all. ",
        "Dinah: I'm going to tell you a little story, okay? ",
        "Bill: Okay. ",
        "Dinah: When I was in europe, in prison, they mostly kept us in isolation, but \r\nevery now and again, they let the prisoners mingle. Let me tell you, I'm scrappy \r\nbut some of the women in that place, not to mention the guards? And then I \r\nfigured out the best way to survive a situation like this was to run up to the \r\nbiggest, baddest plug ugly and smack her right in the mouth, just to show her \r\nI'm not afraid. ",
        "Bill: Well, did she fight back? ",
        "Dinah: Yeah, of course she did. She beat me to a pulp. She fractured my jaw. \r\n(Laughter) ",
        "Bill: My goodness. ",
        "Dinah: Yeah, but after that, man, I had her respect. ",
        "Bill: I don't know if i should be laughing or crying right now, but... (\r\nlaughter) what is the moral of this terrible, horrible tale? ",
        "Dinah: Well, the spauldings are the big ugly in town, right? ",
        "Bill: About as big and ugly as they get, yeah. ",
        "Dinah: Okay. Well, to get a little respect, you've got to smack them in the \r\nmouth, little brother. ",
        "Shayne: Did you really think that I'd go without you? Arin sout usgo to \r\nbosnia together? You know, you're really something, lewis. You could be playing \r\nbaseball, making millions. ",
        "Shayne: That's not the way i think about it. It doesn't matter. It's not what \r\nI'm giving up, it's not about that. It's about what I could do. About what we \r\ncould do. Come with me. ",
        "Marina: Right now? ",
        "Shayne: Today, tomorrow, next week. It doesn't matter, as long as you say \r\nyes. ",
        "Marina: But my dad, my whole family... ",
        "Shayne: No, no, no. Your family, they're tough. They're going to be fine. \r\nListen, I wouldn't make you go. I couldn't do that. But if you... if you want to \r\nas bad as I do, if you think about it as much as I do, you won't be able to say \r\nno. Just think about it. I'll give you, uh, ten minutes. ",
        "R we' jcoerne about shayne's safety. We'd like to see him stay in one piece.\r\n",
        "Sandy: Yeah, yeah. You're being parents, I know. But... ",
        "Josh: Look, you have a couple of kids, you'll understand. ",
        "Sandy: Maybe, but think about what kind of world this would be without guys \r\nlike shayne. ",
        "Josh: I hate it when he's right. Especially about something like this. ",
        "Reva: I know this. I mean, I understand all of this. I'm proud of shayne, \r\ntoo, but i don't think I can do this. I don't think I can let go. ",
        "Josh: It's pretty hard to imagine right now, isn't it? ",
        "Reva: I mean, why can't it be someone else's son? I mean, why does he have to \r\nbe so... ",
        "Josh: Reva, he's our son. He's your son. ",
        "Reva: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. No. Do not blame this on me. I never wanted \r\nto change the world. I just wanted a bigger piece of it, because I was selfish. \r\nAnd I still am, and that's why i want him to stay home, safe and sound. I mean, \r\nI don't care what he does. He can go play baseball. He can sell farm equipment. \r\nI don't care. But this is you, because you're the one who taught him to be such \r\na good person and taught him to care about other people. ",
        ">&gtH: Iorry ",
        "Reva: I mean, I was worried about him playing baseball or skipping college, \r\nbut this? Going to this place? I mean, bosnia? I mean, he could get... ",
        "Josh: He could get hurt here, too. We both know that. ",
        "Reva: Why do our kids keep leaving? ",
        "Josh: I don't know. Maybe it's because we did something wrong. Or we did \r\nsomething very right. ",
        "Edmund: Cassie, jeffrey o'neill has had an agenda ever since he set foot in \r\nthis town. ",
        "Cassie: And what do you think his agenda is now? ",
        "Edmund: Well, figure it out. First he takes down the mob and then he almost \r\ntakes down the spaulding family, so why is he still here? ",
        "Cassie: To help me, edmund. To protect our family. ",
        "Edmund: Exactly. But I always thought that was my job. ",
        "Reva: Both our kids are going to be halfway around the world. ",
        "Josh: Reva, if I could figure out a way to make them both stay home... ",
        "Reva: We'd have to lock them in their closets. ",
        "Josh: (Laughs) ",
        "Reva: I just... I'm going to be so worried, you know? About him, because he's \r\nour little boy. ",
        "Josh: He's not a little boy anymore. ",
        "Reva: I know, and I hate it. ",
        "Josh: I hate where he's going, but I'm proud of him. ",
        "Reva: Me, too. ",
        "Shayne: Hey. ",
        "Reva: Squirt. ",
        "Shayne: You haven't called me that in a long time. ",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, at times like this, parents are entitled. So, this is \r\npretty much a done deal, right? I mean, you're probably already packed. ",
        "Shayne: Yeah. I'm sorry about the timing, with marah gone. ",
        "Reva: Don't do that. Don'T. Don't be sorry. ",
        "Shayne: So, you're okay with this? (Laughter) ",
        "Josh: Sorry. No, \"okay\" is not really a good choice of words here. We're not \r\ngoing to be okay with this until you're back here and home safe with us. But if \r\nthis is what you feel you need to do, we're behind you 100%, son. ",
        "Reva: And we couldn't love you more. You can't even imagine how much. ",
        "Shayne: I hate having to leave you guys. I just feel like I need to. ",
        "Josh: You know, I myself would have taken the contract. But then again, I've \r\nalways known that you're a better man than I am. ",
        "Marina: So you're saying if i have the airline ticket, it'll make the \r\npassport quicker. ",
        "Olivia: So, what, you dragged me down here to slam another door in my face.\r\n",
        "Bill: No. I changed my mind. ",
        "Olivia: You're kidding. ",
        "Bill: Uh-huh. ",
        "Olivia: Why the sudden change? ",
        "Bill: Does it really matter? I just think it's time to give to give old phil \r\na smack in the mouth, that's all. ",
        "Olivia: Oh. Whoa, whoa, there cowboy. I like the image and all, but you \r\nshould know that phillip has something up his sleeve. ",
        "Bill: We've got sleeves, too. ",
        "Olivia: I got it. I got it, I got it. That's good. ",
        "Alan: Well, it's springfield. ",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm. As it is today. All very quaint, familiar. ",
        "Alan: And what is this? ",
        "Phillip: This is the new springfield. And when I'm finished, it's all going \r\nto belong to us. ",
        "Mailman: Frank achilles cooper, srr? ",
        "Buzz: That would be me. Thank you. Thanks. Ew. ",
        "Frank: Who's that from, pop? ",
        "Buzz: The state of illinois. ",
        "Harley: Oh, gosh. I hope it's not the health department. It's not about your \r\nmoussaka. ",
        "Buzz: Are you familiar with the term \"eminent domain\"? ",
        "Frank: Yeah, sure. That's when the government condemns your property so they \r\ncan take it away. Why? ",
        "Buzz: Because the domain you're standing on is eminent. They want to tear \r\nthis place down. ",
        "Cassie: Edmund. ",
        "Edmund: I want to be the one who saves you, cassie. I want to be the one you \r\nneed when you're in trouble. ",
        "Cassie: Oh, don't you know that you did save me? Edmund, you saved me when i \r\nneeded saving the most. There's no reason for you to be jealous. ",
        "Edmund: Jealous? (Laughs) who said I was jealous? ",
        "Cassie: You're not? ",
        "Edmund: Well, have you ever known me to be jealous? ",
        "Cassie: You? ",
        "Edmund: (Laughs) ",
        "Cassie: No, never. Uh-uh. ",
        "Edmund: I just... I just... i don't want anyone to take... i don't want \r\nanyone to take advantage of you, because if they do, they're going to find out \r\nthe kind of person I really am. ",
        "Cassie: No one's going to take me. And there's one thing that impostor can \r\nnever have. That's you. ",
        "Ross: Dinah would never come back to springfield. ",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that's good. And I'm assuming that you don't know her \r\nwhereabouts. That's why I won't ask you any questions that would imply \r\notherwise. ",
        "Ross: You're all heart, jeffrey. ",
        "Jeffrey: The girl committed murder. She's got to be punished. (Cell phone \r\nrings) ",
        "Dinah: Hello? Daddy. What's up? ",
        "Ross: We have to talk. Now. ",
        "Dinah: Okay. Talk. ",
        "Ross: No, in person. I need to see you in person, right now. ",
        "Next, on \"guiding light\"... ",
        "Michelle: Whoops. ",
        "Jeffrey: No, you listen to me. You're the one who better watch out, sweetie, \r\nbecause you try to cross me, you will wish you were back in that cell that I \r\ndragged you out of. You got it? "
