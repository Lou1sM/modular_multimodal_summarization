No one fears us anymore. There was a time when crossing a member of this family was like sticking a loaded gun in your mouth.

", "Phillip: Think about what just happened at that wedding. Frank cooper stuck a gun in your face in our home. Alex was arrested. Gus was humiliated. In our home. And the coopers walked away without a scratch. Fear, alan. We're going to have that again, and we're going to take back what's rightfully ours. ", "Alan: What's that?

I have no interest in helping you take down good old phillip. ", "Olivia: Oh, come on. Where's your sense of fun? Your lust for adventure? ", "Bill: Revenge is not my idea of a good time. Okay? I'm more of a success guy. Besides, my mom and daddy wouldn't approve. ", "Olivia: That's sweet. Still worried about what other people think, huh? ", "Bill: Not as worried as I am about trusting you. ", "Olivia: And yet, I'm the one who's been loyal to you. I came to you when you were running lewis. I'm still here even after your uncle josh let you go. ", "Bill: I quit. ", "Olivia: Did they fight to keep you? ", "Bill: Well, you know, it wouldn't have mattered. Besides, none of that has anything to do with you and me. ", "Olivia: Yes, it does. You have an opportunity to leave lewis construction in the dust. Think of the team we could form. ", "Bill: Oh. Olivia, you have no interest in forming a team, or success or anything but revenge, and as much as I want to be a player in this town, I have no interest in getting involved in this vendetta of yours against the spauldings. So, unless you have anything else to say... ", "Olivia: Revenge? Success? What difference does it make, as long as you get what you want? At least I'm not afraid of the fight. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Why are you here? ", "Dinah: I was watching jeffrey from afar. ", "Edmund: Did you see what happened to cassie? ", "Dinah: No. But the idea of jeffrey playing superman cracks me up. ", "Edmund: Well, I'm glad to know you find this all so funny. ", "Dinah: (Laughs) you don't think that this was an accident, do you? Do you think that cassie is in some kind of danger? Pardon me. I'm sorry. You barely know me and I'm already prying into your girlfriend's life. ", "Edmund: Wait, wait, wait. Your friend jeffrey o'neill seems to think she's in danger. It's why he's taken such a personal interest in her case. ", "Dinah: Well, it's a dirty job. Somebody has to do it, right? ", "Edmund: Well, he's the district attorney. I suppose it is his job. ", "Dinah: Didn't his job end when he arrested that mobster? Wasn't he scheduled to leave town? ", "Edmund: Yes, but then he started to help cassie. ", "Dinah: And he decided to stick around. Interesting. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: Did you really expect to find someone here? ", "Jeffrey: Do me a favor, okay? Stop bugging me, make yourself useful and see if anything is out of place around here. ", "Cassie: Is this about the identity thieves? Did you get a new lead? Are they in town, jeffrey? ", "Jeffrey: Look, there's nothing new, cassie. Please, just help me out, would you? ", "Cassie: Stop keeping things from me! I don't know why that planter fell, but I'm not the only one who could have been hurt. Rj could have been hurt, too, and I need to know what's going on here. ", "Jeffrey: Okay, take it easy. Nothing happened. Rj is fine, not a bruise on him. ", "Cassie: Comfort's cheap. I want answers. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Shayne: I want to give something back. And I need to go somewhere to do that. To make up for all the gifts that I've been given. ", "Reva: What are you talking about? ", "Ross: Maybe I can help, because shayne has certainly done his homework. He knew all about the program i started, which is going to benefit springfield's sister city, which you may or may not know is sarajevo, capital of bosnia. And he has asked me to sponsor his work. ", "Josh: His work? ", "Ross: Yeah, he'S... shayne, why don't you tell them? ", "Shayne: I've decided I'm going to start up a youth program. It's going to be sort of like a mini peace corps. ", "Reva: In bosnia? ", "Shayne: Mom, I'm going to be okay. I'll be okay. ", "Josh: You've been thinking about this for a long time, haven't you, son? ", "Shayne: Yeah, I have. ", "Ross: He's given this a lot of thought, and believe me, he's going to help a lot of people, do a lot of good for them and I'll do everything I can to help.", "Reva: Ross, no offense, but... ", "Ross: None taken. I know you have a lot to discuss. ", "Sandy: Well, I am beyond impressed, man. I don't know that I could do that. You're giving up a lot. ", "Shayne: That's what makes it so meaningful. So important. Mom, dad, I've got to... ", "Josh: No, it's okay. Go ahead. ", "Reva: Can we let him do this? ", "Josh: I don't really know that we have any choice, reva. ", "Ross: Well, I'm glad to see that you're all surviving. What about darci? ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Frank: Darci is still gone, ross. ", "Ross: Frank, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for you guys, too. ", "Harley: Don't worry, we're all better off. So when can frank have his job back? ", "Frank: Harley? ", "Harley: What? Haven't you paid enough? ", "Ross: Well, we have a bit of a problem in that he pulled a gun on alan spaulding in front of 35 or 40 witnesses. ", "Buzz: Alan pushed him too far. The whole family did. ", "Frank: Look, I think we all know that I made a big mistake. But you also know that I'm damn good at my job. ", "Ross: Yeah, I know that, frank, but it's going to take some time, and you should use this time, this little break that you have, to get things together. And for heaven's sakes, stay away from the spauldings, would you? Don't give alan any more ammunition. ", "Harley: I couldn't agree more, by the way. ", "Ross: Excuse me, I have to check in with city hall. ", "Frank: That's great. I don't know what's going to take more time, getting my job back or finding darci. ", "Buzz: Are you going to be okay with the bills, the rent and everything? ", "Harley: You know what? He's going to be fine. ", "Buzz: You're sure about that? ", "Harley: I'm sure. Because he's moving in with me. ", "Buzz: He is? ", "Frank: I am? ", "Harley: You are. Hey, I said we're going to build a bunker. Let's do it, right? As a matter of fact, why don't you both move in? ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: Well, you've piqued my curiosity. What exactly do you have planned? ", "Phillip: I'll do you one better. I'll show you. ", "Olivia: You're home. ", "Phillip: Yes. Safe and sound. Emma is taking a nap. ", "Olivia: Yeah, I know. I peeked in. You know, for a while I was afraid you weren't going to bring her back. ", "Phillip: No. She missed you. ", "Olivia: Well, thanks for saying that. Island life must have treated you well. You're in a good mood. ", "Phillip: I was just about to say the same thing about you. ", "Alan: Yes, you know, a good divorce brings out that old inner glow in olivia.", "Olivia: Do you mind? I'm trying to have a conversation. ", "Alan: Well, as was I, until i was interrupted. ", "Olivia: So sorry. Look, I just want you to know that I'm looking for a house, or maybe I'll take a room at the beacon. ", "Phillip: Whatever you want, but there's no rush. ", "Olivia: Well, I appreciate that, but I'm devoted to finding a place to live. And, you know, business is going to have to take a back seat, at least for a little while. ", "Phillip: I've been thinking the same thing. ", "Olivia: Really? ", "Phillip: Mm-hmm. ", "Olivia: Well, good. Maybe emma could use some time with both her parents. I don't know, maybe I'll take up a hobby. Golf. ", "Phillip: (Laughs) golf. ", "Olivia: (Laughs) what? ", "Phillip: I haven't played golf... I haven't played in a long time. I'll have to get back to it sometime. It's very relaxing. ", "Olivia: Yeah? ", "Phillip: Mm-hmm. ", "Olivia: See you on the fairway? ", "Phillip: Don't forget to yell \"fore.\" You don't want to hit anybody. ", "Olivia: Oh, god forbid. ", "Alan: (Chuckles) she's coming after us. ", "Phillip: Oh, I hope so. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dinah: Gosh, this thing could have really hurt someone. ", "Edmund: What were you implying just now? ", "Dinah: Sorry? ", "Edmund: With jeffrey o'neill not leaving town. What were you implying? ", "Dinah: Oh. Uh, it just... it seems odd to me that the da would be spending so much time on this case. Why can't the police handle it? ", "Edmund: Well, jeffrey o'neill has international connections. ", "Edmund: Listen, you obviously have something to say. Why don't you just come out and say it? ", "Dinah: Well, edmund, you and I both know that if jeffrey wants something, he will do anything to get it. And if cassie is something that he wants... ", "Edmund: Well, are you saying that he staged this accident? ", "Dinah: Well, I don't know. I didn't see it. ", "Edmund: (Laughs) well, that's ridiculous. That's ridiculous. I mean, the jeffrey o'neill i know, I can't stand, I despise him, but even this is beneath him. ", "Dinah: Well, sure. I , you'robly rit. I mean, he's probably changed. He's probably a better man. A selfless, caring, decent man. Have a good day, edmund.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: So, you need to be prepared for anything. You got lucky this time, if this accident wasn't, indeed, an accident. ", "Cassie: How did they get in here? Where did they go? ", "Jeffrey: I don't know. We're going to figure that out, cassie.I] ", "Cassie: But what if this was a warning? What if it was an attempt? What if it was just the first attempt? ", "Jeffrey: Well, then, I'm going to make sure that there's not a second attempt, okay? ", "Cassie: Okay, thank you, but you know, you almost didn't get here in time.", "Jeffrey: Don't even think about that. ", "Cassie: I have to think about it, because you said that you were going to protect me, but you almost didn't make it. ", "Jeffrey: Does this mean you want me to stay closer to you now? ", "Cassie: To keep my kids safe, yes, you bet. I mean, you need to stay as close as you can. ", "Jeffrey: Okay. Well, in that case, you've got some potting soil in your hair.", "Coming up on \"guiding light.\" ", "Cassie: But if I or the children are in danger, it doesn't hurt to have the da on your side. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Of course not. Unless, of course, he's the danger. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marina: I'm proud of shayne, too, but I don't think I can do this. I don't think I can let go. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Shayne: Listen, I want you to go with me. Oprah: What really happens inside detox, ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Tell me something, mr. O'neill. How is it that you happen to be around every time cassie is in trouble? ", "Jeffrey: Well, I don't know what you're insinuating, edmund, but I just saved your girlfriend. Maybe you should be more grateful. ", "Edmund: Oh, believe me, I am. ", "Jeffrey: Well, those questions aren't how you show it. I'm going to go back downstairs, look around. ", "Cassie: What was that? ", "Edmund: Jeffrey o'neill can't play sir galahad without a damsel in distress, which is exactly where you come in. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Buzz: Why don't we let this idea sink in before we make any decisions? ", "Harley: What is to sink in, dad? We can do... we can do this together. We can help frank get his job back together. We can help darci come home. We can help each other move on, together. Right? I mean, hey, the spauldings all live up in that mausoleum and they're not even half the family we are. ", "Buzz: Well, you got that right. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Phillip: Well, I don't know why anybody would take it personally. It's business.\u00e7\u00f3 it's just business, pure and simple. So let's move on this now.
