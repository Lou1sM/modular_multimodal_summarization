        "Buzz: This is your father. Again. You don't pick up the phone, you don't call me back. Where are you? I'm worried about you. You have a wedding in a couple of days or so and this 'Runaway Bride' schtick isn't funny. Call me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Lizzie, do you want to give me a hand, here?",
        "Lizzie: My hands are full, Coop. Can you not see that?",
        "Coop: With what? I mean, she's got to weigh, what? Like, three pounds?",
        "Lizzie: I know, but she's nervous about this move. She's shaking. Look.",
        "Coop: ( Groans )",
        "Lizzie: What are you doing?",
        "Coop: I am taking a break. Since you're not going to help me...",
        "Lizzie: I think you need to go to the gym a couple more times a week.",
        "Coop: No, I think you just need to economize. I mean, there is no way you're going to need all this stuff, let alone all these clothes. You don't even wear all of them.",
        "Lizzie: They could come in handy someday.",
        "Coop: Look, I think you're doing the right thing and I'm proud of you for doing this, okay?",
        "Lizzie: Thank you. Well, I'm doing as best as I can with the... the B...",
        "Coop: The budget. Yes, it's a hard one, I know. You can say it.",
        "Lizzie: That thing, yeah. I'm trying.",
        "Coop: Well, good. Well, just look at it this way: At least you will be right down the hall from me.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I know. It's just, I'm worried about Roxie. She's used to... she's used to certain amenities. We're going to be okay, aren't we Sweetheart? We won't be here long, I promise.",
        "Coop: What? What do you mean?",
        "Lizzie: Well, I mean, as soon as my mom finds out that, you know, I'm serious about this and she can't intimidate me, then everything will be back to normal.",
        "Coop: Yeah. Yeah, sure. Um, did I mention that you will be right down the hall from me? ( Clears throat ) Come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: I need to talk to you, Phillip. ( Sighs ) Why did you leave me alone? I need you so much right now. I need your wisdom; I need your strength. Things were so much easier when we were kids. We just followed our hearts and that was it. No, I know. You're right. It wasn't always exactly like that. But we always had hope for the future. Oh, Phillip. Your father has asked me to marry him. It's crazy, I know, and what's even crazier is that I'm considering it. You see, he needs someone that he can trust, who can look after the family interests. And after all these years, your family is my family. And the thought of Gus swooping in and replacing you... what should I do? Tell me. Tell me, please, what should I do?",
        "Lillian: Phillip's gone, Beth. Why don't you ask me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: There will be certain accessories that I will need while I'm staying in here, and I will be happy to make it worth your while. Well, at least you can think about it. Everyone has their price, Sir. Including you. \"I'll never be far away.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Bye, Cookie. You're such a good girl. Go home. Okay. This is too much. You know? We came down here, you know, just to find out who dropped that gargoyle on your head and now, I mean, this is just.. this is all a bit... this is a bit much.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, well, we came down here to see if Phillip was still alive or not, so let's get back to work and start putting our heads together.",
        "Harley: I think that's a great idea. But let's not do it here, because I'm sure that your refrigerator is empty and I, for one, could use a drink. How in the world did you find me?",
        "Gus: It wasn't that difficult, Honey. This guy left a contact at the precinct. It's not that hard to track you down.",
        "Mallet: Look, Gus, I tried to talk her out of coming down here, so...",
        "Harley: No. I wanted to come down here. We have a lead.",
        "Gus: A lead? That's great.",
        "Harley: Yes. Something that could prove that Phillip's alive.",
        "Gus: Oh, that lead brought you here?",
        "Mallet: Yeah. Well, I live here.",
        "Gus: Hm.",
        "Harley: Yeah. This is just a pit stop. I mean, he had a number. He found a car...",
        "Gus: Yeah. Honey, Honey...",
        "Harley: ...Rental plate number and...",
        "Gus: You're not chasing after a man that's dead. You're here because this is where you used to live, right? You used to live here, when you were married to him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Well, what about... what... your mom? What if she doesn't give in?",
        "Lizzie: Then I guess I'll have to get used to living the simple life.",
        "Coop: The simple life, huh? Do you really think you can do that?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. Sure. Why not?",
        "Coop: Yeah? Sure? Why not? Lizzie, this right here. This is why not. I mean these dresses here. I can't even pronounce these names.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. I'm going to sell this in a tag sale. I was thinking I could make a few extra dollars that way. Maybe. If I need to.",
        "Coop: You're serious about this, aren't you?",
        "Lizzie: Yes, we are very serious.",
        "Coop: Okay, well, it's not going to be easy.",
        "Lizzie: Yes, but Uncle Coop, you'll be here for us. You'll take care of us.",
        "Coop: That's right. Uncle Coop will be here. And Dad's going to be here. And Frank and Harley and the kids, too.",
        "Lizzie: Oh. But then it'll just make it a little bit more of a challenge to sneak into your room.",
        "Coop: You think so, huh?",
        "Lizzie: I do.",
        "Coop: Whoa!",
        "Lizzie: Buzz.",
        "Coop: Dad, hey.",
        "Buzz: Oh. We've got to get a few things straight.",
        "Coop: About... about what?",
        "Buzz: About this arrangement. We've got to lay some ground rules.",
        "Coop: Okay. Okay. Dad, we are adults here and we certainly don't need a babysitter.",
        "Buzz: Well, I, in what might call when comes to her, in loco parentis. Which means you're loco if you don't think I'm her mommy, her daddy and her dog wrangler.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: How did you know that I was here?",
        "Lillian: Well, Alex told me you had gone to see Alan. So, I thought you might need to come here.",
        "Beth: I needed to feel close to Phillip.",
        "Lillian: And to ask for his advice?",
        "Beth: Something like that?",
        "Lillian: Well, what's bothering you, honey? Did Alan say something?",
        "Beth: It's nothing.",
        "Lillian: ( Laughs ) You wouldn't have come here if it was nothing-- and you're biting your lip.",
        "Beth: So?",
        "Lillian: Beth, you bite your lip since you've been two years old when you're upset.",
        "Beth: I'm so confused.",
        "Lillian: Why?",
        "Beth: Alan asked me to marry him. And I'm not joking.",
        "Lillian: Alan asked you to marry him? Well, he can't be serious. I mean, he's out of his mind.",
        "Beth: I'm not so sure about that.",
        "Lillian: Beth, you have to be sure. He shot Phillip.",
        "Beth: I know that.",
        "Lillian: And then he claims he's not dead. I mean he is out of his mind.",
        "Beth: I don't think that he meant to kill Phillip.",
        "Lillian: Oh, and that makes it all right?",
        "Beth: Mom, the reason that Alan wants me to marry him is so that I will be a position to protect Lizzie and James birthright. Phillip's legacy.",
        "Lillian: You don't have to marry him to do that. You certainly don't love him.",
        "Beth: Love. That doesn't matter.",
        "Lillian: It should.",
        "Beth: I married for love before. It didn't work out.",
        "Lillian: He's manipulating you.",
        "Beth: He's locked up.",
        "Lillian: Yes, and you're going to be his pawn.",
        "Beth: Come on.",
        "Lillian: Honey, you're much too good for this. Don't you see that? You're much too good for him.",
        "Beth: Yes, I agree with you. You're absolutely right.",
        "Lillian: Then what in God's name are you thinking of? Why are you doing this?",
        "Beth: For the one thing I have never had: Power.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse: Your lawyer is here?",
        "Alan: My lawyer?",
        "Russo: Alan, no worries. I will have you out of here in a jiffy. We won't be needing you anymore. Thank you.",
        "Alan: Vince Russo.",
        "Russo: Here to offer my services.",
        "Alan: Well, Vince, I already have a lawyer.",
        "Russo: Yeah. If you hired me, you wouldn't be in this four by four situation.",
        "Alan: But I thought you and Leo Flynn were...",
        "Russo: Oh, he's a has been. Cut him loose.",
        "Alan: Weren't you a junior partner though?",
        "Russo: Potato, tomato. I'm on my own now. And I'm doing quite well. Thank you.",
        "Alan: Well, jolly good for you.",
        "Russo: Actually, I get my jollies after I've been paid. There's just something about crisp, clean cash.",
        "Alan: Well, it seems that we speak the same language.",
        "Russo: Then you'll understand when I tell my prices have gone up.",
        "Alan: Can I take that to mean you guarantee results?",
        "Russo: Alan, you have used me before off the books. Have I ever given you anything less than the dirtiest of my dirty?",
        "Alan: Well, there's something to be said about a good ambulance chaser.",
        "Russo: That's more like it. I knew you loved me.",
        "Alan: You get me out of here and I'll send you a dozen of red roses.",
        "Russo: Does that mean the check's in the mail?",
        "Alan: Don't disappoint me.",
        "Russo: Satisfaction is my middle name.",
        "Alan: And this is your first television spot.",
        "Russo: What's this?",
        "Alan: A note from my son Phillip.",
        "Russo: A note from the son you shot dead?",
        "Alan: He's not dead.",
        "Russo: Oh, that's right. I forgot.",
        "Alan: I'm telling you the truth.",
        "Russo: Oh, of course he is.",
        "Alan: Are you being disrespectful?",
        "Russo: No, no, no. No. Let's just assume for argument's sake that he's alive...",
        "Alan: He is.",
        "Russo: Oh, let's further assume that he wrote this note. How did he get it in here?",
        "Alan: That's why I'm paying you the big bucks to find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Look, I didn't come here for some stroll down memory lane.",
        "Gus: And you just happened to pick this place, right?",
        "Mallet: I live here.",
        "Gus: No, I understand. But didn't you both live here?",
        "Harley: This was just a pit stop. Because the car rental agency was closed.",
        "Gus: Hmm. Very inconvenient when that happens.",
        "Mallet: Gus, I'm not going to apologize for saving old photos.",
        "Gus: I don't think I asked you to. Did I say anything about that?",
        "Mallet: I don't think so. We had a life together, okay? Least I got her down the aisle once. I'm going to go get that drink.",
        "Gus: Is he trying to tell me something?",
        "Harley: I don't know. No.",
        "Gus: This is a little weird. It's kind like a shrine, don't you think?",
        "Harley: Well, what girl wouldn't want her own museum?",
        "Gus: Does he got a piece of wedding cake around here, too? Saved?",
        "Harley: I don't know. Look in the freezer. I don't know.",
        "Gus: All right, I will. No. Just got this booze right here. Which I think I'll have. A little shot and I'll make a toast to myself, to history.",
        "Harley: Gus...",
        "Gus: You're right. My manners. What's the matter with me? ( Laughs ) We could toast together, Honey. Honey, I'm okay with that. That might be too much for you. There you go.",
        "Harley: Okay, I have a history.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: I have one.",
        "Gus: I can see that.",
        "Harley: I don't think you can see anything. The only reason I'm here is because of Phillip. Because if he's still alive there's no ...",
        "Gus: He's not alive.",
        "Harley: You don't know that.",
        "Gus: Yes, I do know that. Yes, I do. I saw the body, remember?",
        "Harley: In the casket?",
        "Gus: Let me ask you something. Isn't there something you'd rather be doing like looking at fabric for bride's... dresses? What do they call them? Brides...",
        "Harley: Maids.",
        "Gus: Bridesmaid dresses. Yeah. Or fabric or china patterns or little flowers or something? Isn't that what people usually do?",
        "Harley: I don't know.",
        "Gus: Isn't that what they want to do?",
        "Harley: I don't know who you think you're marrying here. I'm not June Cleaver. I'm a cop.",
        "Gus: Are you still a cop?",
        "Harley: I still think like a cop. I'm terrified this guy is out there. And that he will come after you and he will come after my family and my kids.",
        "Gus: That's why you felt like you had to go behind my back and lie to me, right?",
        "Harley: Well, maybe because I knew you'd react like this.",
        "Gus: I'm reacting to how you're using the Phillip thing to avoid the wedding thing.",
        "Harley: No, you are using the wedding to avoid the truth. Not just about Phillip, but about us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Dad, no offense, but Lizzie doesn't need you right now. I mean the last thing that she need is another freaked out parent.",
        "Buzz: Who's freaked out?",
        "Coop: That right there. That's the look in your eyes. That's the freaked out look.",
        "Lizzie: Coop, stop.",
        "Coop: No, I'm just saying that right now she gave us back Company, okay. And we should be a little grateful towards her for doing that.",
        "Buzz: I am grateful. I'm very grateful.",
        "Coop: Okay, so what's with all the ground rules? I mean, A, she's working? Huh? All right. And, B, she's living here.",
        "Buzz: True. But there are kids... little kids living here.",
        "Coop: Okay, so what's the point with that?",
        "Buzz: You know the point.",
        "Coop: Oh, no, no, no. They wouldn't be seeing...",
        "Buzz: That would be rule number one.",
        "Coop: Oh, come on, Dad. I mean what are you going to do? You're going to slap electronic anklet bracelets that beep every time we go off--next to each other?",
        "Buzz: Why don't I?",
        "Coop: No. Okay, Dad, you're nuts.",
        "Lizzie: Well, no, your dad's right.",
        "Coop: What?",
        "Lizzie: We have to keep in mind what's best for Zach and Jude. And... and my little Roxie. I honestly.... I really like the idea of having rules.",
        "Buzz: Really?",
        "Lizzie: Yes. It just... it means you care. And, Buzz Cooper, you are one awesome guy. I had no idea that my grandfather was wrong about you.",
        "Buzz: Thanks. I think.",
        "Lizzie: Now I got to go get Roxie situated. But I want to know all about the rules, okay. Because I don't want to break them.",
        "Buzz: Okay.",
        "Lizzie: All right.",
        "Buzz: Well, she's seems happy.",
        "Coop: Yeah. She's trying to be. You... what's with you?",
        "Buzz: Me?",
        "Coop: Yes, you. I mean this. I mean all these ground rules. I mean why are you coming down on us all of sudden so hard?",
        "Buzz: Well, you know, every once in awhile I have to check up on my kids. Like every two years or so.",
        "Coop: So what now? Lizzie is the enemy here?",
        "Buzz: No. I don't mind her. She's, you know, she's kind of grown on me as a matter of fact.",
        "Coop: Okay, then what is it? And don't even tell me it's the kids. Because you know, they wouldn't be seeing anything that they're not suppose to.",
        "Buzz: No, it's about you. I hate seeing you hold yourself back.",
        "Coop: ( Laughs ) Where? What are you doing? I mean you're all over the place. I don't even know what the hell you're talking about.",
        "Buzz: I found your stash.",
        "Coop: What? My what?",
        "Buzz: When were you going to tell me about it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lillian: Whatever happened to the down to earth sweet, little girl that I raised? I mean she wasn't concerned with power.",
        "Beth: I'm not that person anymore.",
        "Lillian: Since when?",
        "Beth: ( Laughs ) Since I learned how the world really works.",
        "Lillian: Now you're sounding a lot like Alan. Completely cynical.",
        "Beth: I'm not cynical. But I'm not naive either.",
        "Lillian: Beth, doesn't this sort of remind you of a time when you were seduced by the title princess and a crown?",
        "Beth: No, this is completely different. My eyes are wide open.",
        "Lillian: Really?",
        "Beth: No one is seducing me. No one's turning my head.",
        "Lillian: He's using you.",
        "Beth: Yes, yes. And I can use him, too. As Alan's wife, I can protect my children. You know what that's like to want to protect your children.",
        "Lillian: Yes, that's what I'm trying to do right now.",
        "Beth: I want to keep Gus from taking over the company, from taking over the family. He wants to erase every trace that Phillip and Alan ever existed.",
        "Lillian: When did Gus become this sworn enemy?",
        "Beth: What? When he nearly destroyed Lizzie on the witness stand.",
        "Lillian: You're right.",
        "Beth: And he convinced her to move out of the house.",
        "Lillian: I don't think that's such a bad idea.",
        "Beth: Excuse me?",
        "Lillian: Well, Honey, I think she'll do much better on her own. I know you don't want to hear it, but it's the truth. She's become much stronger.",
        "Beth: I'm sorry, but you're wrong there.",
        "Lillian: And I imagine that Alan agrees with this, right?",
        "Beth: Yes. I know what's best for Lizzie. I know what's best for both my children.",
        "Lillian: Is that saying 'I do' to Alan?",
        "Beth: It just might be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Russo: Sorry, Alan, but where's the proof?",
        "Alan: The proof is in your hands.",
        "Russo: A note?",
        "Alan: Yes. It's Phillip's handwriting. Check it out.",
        "Russo: Dead man writing. That's it? What? You're asking the impossible.",
        "Alan: You don't even know what I'm asking you. Look, Phillip is not just going to show himself. He's having too much fun toying with us.",
        "Russo: Us? But no one else believes that he's still...",
        "Alan: Yes, someone does. Harley Cooper.",
        "Russo: The woman you framed for his murder?",
        "Alan: The woman who is responsible for pushing my son over the edge.",
        "Russo: All right, let me get this straight. You want me to team up with Harley Cooper?",
        "Alan: No.",
        "Russo: Then what do you want me to do?",
        "Alan: I have a plan.",
        "Russo: A plan. Okay. Good. Lay it on me.",
        "Alan: Phillip is going to have to be coaxed out.",
        "Russo: Okay.",
        "Alan: I want you to plant some gossip that something going on between a notorious murder and the victim's ex-wife.",
        "Russo: You want me to leak a story to the press?",
        "Alan: Precisely.",
        "Russo: Which ex?",
        "Alan: Beth Raines. The only one that counts.",
        "Russo: The blonde, right? Ooh, she's hot.",
        "Alan: Yeah. You know, I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't refer to my future bride as hot.",
        "Russo: You don't think she's hot?",
        "Alan: Beth is a very charming and attractive woman. The important thing is that Phillip believes that she and I are going to walk down that aisle.",
        "Russo: Or a cell block as it may be. Okay, you want me to go to the tabloids. No problem. We are like that.",
        "Alan: Well, now you're catching on.",
        "Russo: And what about me getting you out of here?",
        "Alan: Well, that's very important. But the main priority is to smoke Phillip out.",
        "Russo: And you think this Beth thing is going to do it?",
        "Alan: My marriage to Beth won't just cause smoke, it will set this town afire.",

        "Alan: You know what to do. Now go and do it.",
        "Russo: With...",
        "Nurse: A call for you.",

        "Gus: Well, no. Actually this right here, this is you guys. This is you and Mallet.",
        "Harley: Forget about Mallet. I'm talking about the investigation.",
        "Gus: Oh, there is no investigation, babe. There's no investigation. You're chasing ghost. Don't you see? That's not real.",
        "Harley: Yes, it is. It is to me. This is important to me. It's who I am.",
        "Gus: Oh, listen to you. Don't, don't, don't do that, please.",
        "Harley: No, no. The woman that you say you love, that you say you love. This is who I am. This is the stuff that I do.",
        "Gus: Hold. Hold. No, no, no. I do love you. I love you very much.",
        "Harley: Then let me finish what I started. Or better yet, help me finish it.",

        "Harley: No, you're not. Well, forget the bikini part. I'm saying, wait for me. Okay, just wait for me. Doesn't that sound like fun?",
        "Gus: No bikinis. Yeah, kind of sounds like fun. I can do that.",
        "Harley: Just let me follow on this one lead, okay. And then I'll come meet you and we can... we can celebrate our honeymoon before our wedding.",

        "Coop: Dad, you read them.",

        "Coop: I can't believe you. What did you do with them?",
        "Buzz: Did you actually beat Prince William in poker?",
        "Coop: Yes. Yes. Eights beats sevens. Yes, I beat him.",

        "Coop: You... yes. You read all of them? Come on!",

        "Coop: Clearly.",
        "Buzz: I mean, you're good. How long have you been...?",
        "Coop: Yeah, since... since I was a kid, all right? Aunt Dot, she bought me a journal when I was eight years old.",

        "Coop: Where is this coming from? I mean, frankly, I don't want to go on this ride with you right now, okay?",
        "Buzz: I wasted a lot of years. Grilling, I don't think is your thing. I think writing is.",
        "Coop: Well, you're right about that. This restaurant business really isn't for me.",
        "Buzz: Well, there you go. Don't give up on your dreams. You don't want to get distracted and wake up 20 years from now wondering why you didn't give it a go.",

        "Mallet: How do you know it's from Phillip?",
        "Alan: Because he quoted something I said the last time I saw him, and no one else was present. Mallet?",

        "Coop: A distraction from what?",
        "Buzz: Your gift. Your writing.",
        "Coop: So, you're saying that in order for me to be a good writer, I need to be single.",

        "Buzz: You're going to write about Springfield?",
        "Coop: Yes, Dad, I'm going to write about Springfield. I mean, there's stuff happening here, too, right?",
        "Buzz: Like what?",

        "Harley: You know, even if that were true...",
        "Gus: It is true.",
        "Harley: That's not the reason that I'm here, so we're talking about two different things.",
        "Mallet: Do you think I'm trying to... do you think I'm making this stuff up?",
        "Gus: I don't know, man. It's pretty obvious to me that you like to be around her, you like to spend your time with her, and I really don't blame you for that.",

        "Lizzie: Mm-hmm. I thought I could maybe sell them if I needed to, to make a little extra money.",
        "Beth: Well, I'd hang on to them if I were you. Very soon there might be an occasion to wear one of them.",
        "Lizzie: What kind of occasion?",
        "Beth: Oh, nothing. Nothing. I was just thinking out loud. Hey, why don't you come home for tea. Cook made peach pie.",
