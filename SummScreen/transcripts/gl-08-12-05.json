        "Danny: Uh-huh, \"Extravagant bride.\" I thought we were just moving in together.",
        "Marina: Very funny. It's for Harley's wedding.",
        "Danny: Mm-hmm.",
        "Marina: Don't flatter yourself there. I've never been a Maid of Honor before. I don't want to fall flat on my face.",
        "Danny: Are you sure the wedding's even going to happen? Nobody even knows where Gus and Harley are.",
        "Marina: I don't know. I have left about a dozen messages for Harley about a Bachelorette Party and she hasn't returned any of my calls.",
        "Danny: I'm sure Harley and Gus' wedding wouldn't be a wedding without a little drama.",
        "Marina: Yeah, well. I had a front row seat the last time they tried and guess what? Lots of drama, no vows. This whole thing can be a bust.",
        "Danny: Relax, it'll happen.",
        "Marina: How can you be so confident? You remember what happened last time.",
        "Michelle: So what'd we say?",
        "Danny: I said that I'm lucky to have found you, the greatest love of my life. And uh, your love makes me more than whole.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: I will do anything to get my wife the baby she wants, Mr. Russo. Money, of course, is no object. Now, is that something you think you can work with?",
        "Russo: It's nice, but babies don't grow on trees, Mr. Winslow. And I'm very, very busy with Alan Spaulding right now, so...",
        "Edmund: Well, you're working for Alan Spaulding? I couldn't ask for a higher recommendation from a lower place. I understand it's very difficult to produce a baby in just a few days, Mr. Russo, but that's what I would be paying you for. And I don't care how you do it. I don't care if I have to match Alan Spaulding dollar for dollar. You have a reputation for getting things done. Why not get this done for me?",
        "Dinah: Edmund, I didn't know you were going to be here. Why don't you introduce me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Stop messing with those bandages, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: ( Sighs ) You don't have to baby-sit me, you know. You have a real baby coming any day now.",
        "Cassie: I'm letting you out of my sight--not after what Nate and Jonathan did to you. I'll tell you right now, the world's better off without Jonathan. Him and Nate deserve each other.",
        "Tammy: That is not true, Mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: She's just about ready.",
        "Jonathan: ( Clears throat ) Thanks.",
        "Nate: We can take her out to some bigger port, rent a nice 30-foot cruiser with the money you've stolen.",
        "Jonathan: Where to?",
        "Nate: Far away from here. Don't worry, Son, the worst of it's over. We did what we had to do. We're leaving a few million richer for it. Good riddance to this town. Good riddance to your so-called family.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, to my family.",
        "Nate: May you never see them again. Cool. Start her up. ( Engine stalling ) Still can't do anything right, can you? ( Engine stalls )",
        "Jonathan: Maybe it's just broken.",
        "Nate: Why would you say that?",
        "Jonathan: Uh... because you can't get it started.",
        "Nate: Yeah, but since I checked the boat from stem to stern, I'm wondering why that is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "( Knocking )",
        "Rick: It's Dr. Bauer. I'm here for the house call.",
        "( Knocking )",
        "Michelle: Rick?",
        "Rick: Michelle?",
        "Michelle: Hi.",
        "Rick: What... well, will you look at this? What are you doing here? When did you get back?",
        "Michelle: Don't be mad at me, okay?",
        "Rick: I'm not mad. I'm just... I'm shocked. Olivia called me over for a house call, but I never in a million years expected to see...",
        "Michelle: Oh, no, don't come too close. I want to give you a hug, but I've got a really nasty stomach bug and I'm having a hard time shaking it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: \"To ensure that the bride's day goes off without a hitch, the maid of honor should try to tie up any loose end she can find.\" Ugh. This is just like taking a class. I mean, it's not like I've never been to a wedding before; I just never had to pay attention to where everyone was standing, and who had to wear what.",
        "Danny: Yup. Sounds like a lot of you-know-what to me.",
        "Marina: I just can't believe Harley's done this so many times and never gotten an ulcer. I mean they even have this part in here as to who gets which side of the closet after you move in together.",
        "Danny: Oh, that's easy. The woman always gets whatever side she wants.",
        "Marina: Oh, have you read the book already? ( Sighs ) I'm going overboard, huh?",
        "Danny: Huh?",
        "Marina: Weddings, moving in together. I am totally freaking you out.",
        "Danny: No you're not.",
        "Marina: I'm not freaking you out?",
        "Danny: No.",
        "Marina: You look a little spacey.",
        "Danny: I do?",
        "Maria: I don't know. This kind of stuff usually makes most guys crazy.",
        "Danny: Well, I'm not most guys. I can't wait for you to move in.",
        "Marina: Really?",
        "Danny: Really. Really, really.",
        "Marina: Can I still hope that Harley and Gus don't show up so we can take their place on the altar?",
        "Danny: What? Huh?",
        "Marina: I'm kidding! Do you need some water there, big guy? I'm just joking. I meant like how we took their place in Chicago.",
        "Danny: Oh, okay. Well, it was a good one. You got me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Dinah, Vincent Russo, Esquire. Vince, Dinah Marler.",
        "Dinah: Ah, you're a lawyer. A divorce lawyer, I hope.",
        "Edmund: Actually, Vince is going to help secure the farm for us.",
        "Dinah: Good. I have some questions for you.",
        "Edmund: Well we're actually just wrapping up here now, Dinah, and please let me do this for you, all right?",
        "Russo: One baby's not good enough for you?",
        "Edmund: I'll call you later with the details, Mr. Russo, all right? Thank you very much.",
        "Russo: Pleasure.",
        "Dinah: Pleasure. Well, you're the man. You're coming through.",
        "Edmund: Just as I promised.",
        "Dinah: You can't know what this means to me.",
        "Edmund: I think I know exactly what it means, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: That fact that you want to give me a life and a family, I mean, that's a simple dream for a lot of people, but I never thought it could be mine.",
        "Edmund: And we are well on our way.",
        "Dinah: Where are you going?",
        "Edmund: Well, I think this calls for a toast, don't you? Wine for me and club soda for you.",
        "Dinah: Well, cheers. I think I feel the contractions starting already.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I cannot believe that you were standing up for this guy after everything he's done to you.",
        "Tammy: He risked his life saving me from Nate.",
        "Cassie: You wouldn't need to be saved if it wasn't for Jonathan in the first place. How about all of the trouble you've had for the past year, Tammy? Or everything he's done to Reva? Or me?",
        "Tammy: Don't do that, Mom, okay? You're way oversimplifying things. \"Oh, Jonathan caused all our problems, and now that he's gone we'll all be fine.\"",
        "Cassie: Let's say we'll have one less thing to worry about, Honey.",
        "Tammy: Why doesn't anyone understand what he went through? All the things that happened to him, the terrible things that made him who he is today.",
        "Cassie: Sweetie, come on. You have been through a lot of terrible things in your life, but you're not going around trying to hurt everybody.",
        "Tammy: I had it way better than Jonathan. I always knew that I had a mom out there who loved me. He didn't even have that.",
        "Cassie: That's no excuse to do everything that he's done.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan's gone now. We don't have to keep attacking him.",
        "Cassie: Okay, fine. But you have to admit that Nate would've never done what he did if it wasn't for Jonathan. You know that.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, I do. I just... I don't care. We all do the best we can with what we've got. JB's no different.",
        "Cassie: Tammy? I mean, Honey, you're in denial here.",
        "Tammy: I'm not. I'll never forget what Jonathan did to me. It's just...",
        "Cassie: Just what?",
        "Tammy: I want to let it go. If all I do is see the bad in him, then I am no different than anyone else in this town.",
        "Cassie: Including me?",
        "Tammy: He was trying to change. Just like you did when you were young. Just like Aunt Reva, even Sandy. I mean, come on, doesn't he deserve a chance to be a person? Once he gets his act together, he may even have something to offer the world. Doesn't he deserve the same second chance everyone else gets?",
        "Cassie: As long as he does it somewhere else.",
        "Sandy: Tammy. Thank god you're all right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: What are you looking at me like that for?",
        "Nate: Like what?",
        "Jonathan: Like you want to take my head off.",
        "Nate: Maybe because I want to take your head off.",
        "Jonathan: Why?",
        "Nate: The spark plugs are missing from the engine. Where are they?",
        "Jonathan: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Nate: What's the matter, Jonnie? You getting chicken?",
        "Jonathan: I just got you the biggest payday you've ever had.",
        "Nate: Yeah, and now you're trying to stop us from leaving with it. Do you really want to do that?",
        "Jonathan: I didn't do anything, Dad, I swear.",
        "Nate: This is just a joke to you, isn't it? I'm taking you with me as a courtesy. I could quite easily dump you off here. Dump you off in the middle of the lake. The simple fact is, Jonathan, I am done with you. Well, where are the plugs?",
        "Jonathan: I think the real question is: What are you going to do to get them away from me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Well, you know, now that I'm here, let me, uh...",
        "Michelle: Rick, you know what? You really shouldn't get too close to me, you know?",
        "Rick: Michelle, who is the M.D. In the family?",
        "Michelle: I'm a Physician's Assistant, I know when I have a contagious cold.",
        "Rick: You always get defensive when I say that. It's not a Doctor/Physician's Assistant thing. I just want to take care of you. Okay, fine. Fine.",
        "Michelle: Unless you've got some chicken soup.",
        "Rick: Boy, that didn't take long, did it?",
        "Michelle: Sorry.",
        "Rick: That's okay.",
        "Michelle: I'm just frustrated you know, because we both know there's no cure for a common cold, and this is what's keep me from seeing everybody, including my son.",
        "Rick: Michelle, I see so much of you in him. I really do. And Danny, of course. But it's been fun, having him. You haven't seen Danny, have you?",
        "Michelle: No, but, you know, I don't want to get in his way. I want him to be happy, whatever he's doing in his life.",
        "Rick: Well, you know, we actually talked at the Bauer barbecue on the fourth. He was saying how you belonged here and how much he couldn't wait for you to come home. But your son missed you so much. He's going to be so happy to see you.",
        "Michelle: I missed him, too.",
        "Rick: We need you to get better, so let me bring something up here for you. All right? Take this once in the morning, once in the evening.",
        "Michelle: Okay.",
        "Rick: All right?",
        "Michelle: Thank you. Sorry I'm so out of it.",
        "Rick: No... no. You had a long trip, Michelle. You know? We'll catch up when you feel better, okay?.",
        "Michelle: Okay. I can't wait.",
        "Rick: Yeah. It's so good to have you home. Bye.",
        "Michelle: Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: You are totally freaking out.",
        "Danny: What? No, I'm not. Just don't use my razor to shave your legs and I'm good.",
        "Marina: You're scared. Admit it.",
        "Danny: Of what? You moving in with me?",
        "Marina: Look, Danny, I'm just happy to be with you, okay? I don't need to split the cable bill or share any closet space. But if you wanted to label your food in the fridge...",
        "Danny: Are you trying to get rid of me?",
        "Marina: Who, me?",
        "Danny: Yeah, you?",
        "Marina: Get rid of you?",
        "Danny: Yeah. Come on. You're giving me all these outs. Are you testing me to see if I really want to do this way you? It was my idea, remember?",
        "Marina: I just don't want to rush you.",
        "Danny: Right. See, the problem is that we've already been taking things a little too slow. I'm ready. You think you can keep up with me?",
        "Marina: Is that a challenge?",
        "Danny: No, no, no. It's an invitation.",
        "Marina: Oh. Well, then, I'm in.",
        "Danny: You sure?",
        "Marina: Mm-hmm.",
        "Danny: Good. ( Cell phone rings ) Going to turn this off. Hello? Hello?",
        "Michelle: Hey, Danny, it's me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: I doubted you, but you came through.",
        "Edmund: Do I get to say \"I told you so\"?",
        "Dinah: No. Not if you want a kick in the shins. Ooh, well, I guess I'm feeling a little more motivated lately to wear this stupid thing. I get you. I get the farm. And I think I'm going to win. Dinah's going to win.",
        "Russo: Babies don't grow on trees, Mr. Winslow.",
        "Dinah: Promise me we're going to win.",
        "Edmund: Dinah...",
        "Dinah: Promise me!",
        "Edmund: Are you back to wanting to beat Cassie? I thought she was your new best friend.",
        "Dinah: Okay, I'm not feeling as much hate for her lately, but I don't think that she deserves to have everything.",
        "Edmund: Well, Cassie has taken Tammy across the street to Cedars. I've got to get her to sign the custody papers, and as soon as I do, I'll get back to you. All right?",
        "Dinah: Uh-uh. No, no, no. Now, for one moment, do you think that I'm going to let you do this alone?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Did anyone hurt you?",
        "Tammy: I'm fine now that you're here.",
        "Sandy: What happened to Jonathan?",
        "Tammy: Nate took him. It's over, Sandy. Jonathan's gone.",
        "Sandy: That's kind of hard to believe: After everything that's happened, that he would just leave and leave you here with me.",
        "Tammy: Can we just get on with it, Sandy? I really don't want to go over everything that's happened. I can't take it right now.",
        "Sandy: I understand, and if I could erase the whole last year I would.",
        "Tammy: In my mind, I'm already doing that.",
        "Sandy: And I'll help you.",
        "Tammy: I know you will. I'm so glad that I'm here with you right now.",
        "Cassie: It's pretty ironic though, isn't it, how Jonathan came through in the end? Isn't it?",
        "Tammy: What do you mean?",
        "Cassie: Well, he saved you.",
        "Tammy: So? So what? Like that one act makes up for everything he did?",
        "Cassie: I'm not saying that. I mean, you were the one who said...",
        "Tammy: Weren't you the one who said that Jonathan wouldn't have had to save me if he hadn't come here in the first place? You were right, okay? So can we just move on with it, please?",
        "Cassie: Sure. I mean, as long as you're ready to do that.",
        "Tammy: Of course. Isn't that what everyone wants? I mean, we can finally get past trying to dodge Jonathan around every corner. I want him to have a chance at life, but the more I think about it, the more I realize how good it is for everyone that he's gone. You can feel safe to start over with the baby. Maybe even Aunt Reva can get over all her guilt.",
        "Cassie: Hey. Well, you know, we all have our lives that we need to get back to. I'm just glad you that you're not fighting getting back to yours.",
        "Tammy: Fighting it? ( Laughs ) I can't wait to start over... with you. Can we do that, please?",
        "Sandy: Yes, we can.",
        "Tammy: Okay. Can we get out of here, then?",
        "Cassie: So, uh, are you seeing what I'm seeing? I don't care what she says. She's still in trouble.",
        "Sandy: Maybe it's... maybe the trouble's over and she's just recovering.",
        "Cassie: Hm.",
        "Sandy: Maybe it'll take some time.",
        "Cassie: Maybe. And I want to help her, but I'm getting the feeling she doesn't want her mother around right now.",
        "Sandy: I'll take care of her. I promise. And I'll call you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: What will I do?",
        "Jonathan: What's the matter, Dad? You didn't think I'd fight back?",
        "Nate: You always fight back, Jonnie. But when do you ever win?",
        "Jonathan: I will this time.",
        "Nate: Why? What are you going to do?",
        "Jonathan: Whatever I have to. You'd kill me before you let me go? Is that what happened with Marissa?",
        "Nate: I loved Marissa.",
        "Jonathan: Is that what you call it?",
        "Nate: You're no good on your own, Jonnie. We both know that. I mean, look what happened when you first came to Springfield. They almost burned you at the stake.",
        "Jonathan: That was because of what I did, not who I am.",
        "Nate: No one else has ever wanted you. Not Tammy, not Reva. Not even Marissa.",
        "Jonathan: Then I guess I've got nothing to lose.",
        "Reva: ( Screams ) No! No! Jonathan, no! Let him go!",
        "Reva: Jonathan, why are you doing this?",
        "Nate: Reva. I thought I heard a White Charger. Did you come to save me?",
        "Reva: No. No. No, no, no! No!",
        "Jonathan: How does it feel?",
        "Reva: Don't. Don't kill him. Don't.",
        "Jonathan: Why? Why? Because he deserves any less? And don't tell me, me killing him makes me just like him because I am and I don't care.",
        "Reva: Yes, you do care. You do care. You never thought you were going to care so much, so fast, but you do care! You know I love you. You know you belong with me. Nate's been wrong about you. He's been wrong about you since you were a child. Please. It wasn't your fault that you loved him. He was your father.",
        "Nate: I still am. And you're my son.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, is that what this is about? One person abandoned me, the other one beat the snot out of me!",
        "Reva: No, don't do it.",
        "Jonathan: I should just step back and let you fight it out.",
        "Reva: No. Please, Jonathan, let him go in every sense of that word. Please come with me, come home with me where you belong.",
        "Jonathan: Why? Because we're going to get it right this time?",
        "Reva: No. But we'll do the best we can. We'll do the best we can. That's all we can do. Please, Jonathan, please.",
        "Nate: ( Coughing )",
        "Reva: Let's go. No! No! Jonathan, no! No, no, no, don't! Don't!",
        "Jonathan: Hey, Dad, look. I found what you were looking for.",
        "Reva: Jonathan, please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Hey, listen, you. You know, you're working hard to convince your mom and me that you're okay, but you don't have to be okay. After all that you've been through, who expects you to be okay? And you don't have to talk about anything until you're ready.",
        "Tammy: Thank you. I couldn't wait to be alone with you because I knew you wouldn't make me answer a bunch of questions.",
        "Sandy: This whole Jonathan thing has been miserable, and we don't need to know any more.",
        "Tammy: Yeah.",
        "Sandy: I really wish I could have protected you.",
        "Tammy: I know you do. You always feel that. And I know that sometimes it seems like I need protecting more than anything else but when I say that Jonathan saved me...",
        "Sandy: Hey, if he did, he did. Thank god he did. If he hadn't, who knows what Nate would have done to you?",
        "Tammy: Well, I want you to know I'm glad that Jonathan's out of our lives, but he... he really came through for me tonight. He risked his life.",
        "Sandy: Well, you're okay. You're not hurt. You're alive. That's all I care about.",
        "Tammy: Then we don't have to talk about it.",
        "Sandy: That's what you wanted when we came in here, right?",
        "Tammy: Despite everything Jonathan did to me-- to everyone-- tonight he did the right thing.",
        "Sandy: And finally listened to reason for once in his life. I mean, the guy had to go but at least now he gets to go out kind of a hero.",
        "Tammy: What do you mean by \"he finally listened to reason?\"",
        "Sandy: To his conscience. And things came out for the best.",
        "Tammy: You sent Jonathan to save me. You sent him at the risk of...",
        "Sandy: There was no risk, Tammy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Cassie? May I speak to you for a moment?",
        "Cassie: Sure. Tammy's... she's okay.",
        "Edmund: Oh, thank God.",
        "Cassie: I mean, she's a little shaken up right now, but she's okay.",
        "Edmund: Good, good.",
        "Dinah: I'm glad she's okay.",
        "Cassie: Thank you.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, if she'll hear it, please tell her how worried I was. I'm so sorry you've gone through all that you've gone through.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Are you... are you okay, Dinah?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. I just... I'm just totally wiped out all of a sudden.",
        "Cassie: Well, exhaustion can sneak up on you at this stage of the pregnancy. You just need to take care of yourself, Dinah. Okay?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Yeah. It's just, I'm having a tough time keeping my eyes open. Edmund, weren't we supposed to discuss something?",
        "Edmund: Oh, Cassie, the doctor called and suggested that Dinah stay off her feet for a while. Perhaps for the rest of the pregnancy.",
        "Cassie: Really? Bed rest? Wow. Then maybe... maybe you should get home right now, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: No. I'm just... I'm sitting. I'm good. You and Edmund need to talk about the farm, anyway.",
        "Cassie: The farm? What about the farm?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Michelle?",
        "Michelle: It's me.",
        "Danny: Yeah, I've been trying to get a hold of you. Haven't you been getting my messages?",
        "Michelle: They weren't always dated, so, you know, I'd get one and then I'd...",
        "Danny: Well, listen. I've been really worried. I mean, you are halfway around the world and things happen.",
        "Michelle: How is Robbie?",
        "Danny: He misses you, Michelle.",
        "Michelle: I miss him so much.",
        "Danny: I really think that you need to come home. I mean, Robbie is growing every day and it's the little things, the everyday stuff that you need to be around for.",
        "Michelle: I know. I know.",
        "Danny: I mean, do you have any plans to come home any time soon? I mean, next week is Parents' Day at Robbie's camp and you could surprise him. He'd love to see you. Do you think you could do that?",
        "Danny: Michelle? Michelle, are you there?",
        "Michelle: I'm here. I'm here.",
        "Danny: Okay, so what do you think? Do you feel like you're ready to come home now?",
        "Michelle: No. No. I'm going to have to.. I'm going to have to stay here a little bit longer.",
        "Danny: All right. I understand. I'm sure Robbie will, too.",
        "Michelle: Well, I'm actually afraid that he won't, you know? He's going to say that he will because he's going to want to be strong for you, but he's not going to understand why his mother isn't around.",
        "Danny: Well, do you want me to be honest with you or do you want me to say something to you that will make you feel better?",
        "Michelle: How about a little of both?",
        "Danny: I'm sorry, I can't do that. I mean, Michelle, you are in another hemisphere, literally, and I understand that you needed some time to sort things out. But, you know, you didn't go to your cabin, you didn't even go to California. You went to Africa. Forget it. You're there. You're dealing with yourself. I'm here and I guess none of us would be where we are if it weren't for me, so just forget I said anything.",
        "Michelle: Look, life takes us wherever it wants, right?",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Michelle: So, where's it taking you these days? Am I interrupting anything?",
        "Danny: Uh, no. I'm just hanging out with Marina. That's it. It's the same old Springfield. Harley was proven innocent, Alan killed Phillip, yadda, yadda, yadda.",
        "Michelle: Oh, my god.",
        "Danny: Yeah, that's pretty much it. Nothing else to report around here.",
        "Michelle: You know what, Danny? I got to go, Danny. I can tell... I know these phones, and this one is going to cut out soon.",
        "Danny: Okay. I'll tell Robbie you called.",
        "Michelle: Okay, bye. What am I doing? What am I doing? I've got to get some air. Okay.",
        "Danny: Sorry. I should not have even gotten into it with her.",
        "Marina: No problem. ( Sighs ) Wait. There is a problem, a small problem, but nothing that I can't handle.",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Marina: Nothing. I'm not going to even get into it. You're fine, I'm fine, everything's fine.",
        "Danny: Huh? What's going on, here?",
        "Marina: Oh, I don't know. You couldn't mention to her that we were moving in together? That you're spending your life with a different woman now?",
        "Danny: Marina, uh, yeah, I mean, I could have.",
        "Marina: Then why didn't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Do you think maybe you should take her home or, I don't know...",
        "Edmund: For heaven's sakes, Cassie, the woman's tired. She fell asleep.",
        "Cassie: Just like that, she fell asleep?",
        "Edmund: Apparently.",
        "Cassie: Okay, so what about the farm, Edmund?",
        "Edmund: Well, I don't know if it's a very good time to discuss it, but I was thinking just for the last few weeks of the pregnancy, with Dinah needing so much help and all, perhaps it would be a good idea if I moved back in.",
        "Cassie: You want to move back in to the farm?",
        "Edmund: Just as a guest, Cassie. Strictly as a guest. I just want to be there to help with feedings and changing and the late nights.",
        "Cassie: You know, I don't know if that's such a good idea.",
        "Edmund: I want to be a hands-on father. I even bought a camcorder to document the child's every breath. Cassie, I'm not going to lie. I'm doing this for you, but mostly, mostly I'd be doing it for the baby. I want to be there to help. Please, just think about it, will you?",
        "Cassie: You know, you already are doing so much to help. I mean, just taking care of Dinah is a huge help.",
        "Edmund: Thank you, Cassie. And don't worry. I can take care of Dinah.",

        "Tammy: What happened between you and Jonathan after Nate took me?",
        "Sandy: Long story short, I knew Jonathan could find Nate a lot faster than I could, which meant finding you, so I told him you were in trouble.",
        "Tammy: That is pretty major. I mean, you hate Jonathan.",
        "Sandy: But I love you a whole lot more than I hate him. Saving you is what's important, not who saved you. What kind of jerk would I be if my ego mattered more than making sure you were okay? How am I ever going to be good enough for you if...",
        "Tammy: Don't! Don't you ever say that again. ( Sighs ) Sandy, you are so good. You are the real hero in my life. Okay? You are the one who's right for me. You.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Why, Jonathan? Why are you doing this?",
        "Jonathan: You shouldn't have come here. You should've just let me go.",
        "Reva: Never.",
        "Nate: Reva, you know, sometimes tenacity is really just only stupidity.",
        "Reva: I'm not leaving here. Not without him.",
        "Jonathan: Do you think you have a choice, Mom? Tammy tried to make me leave, but don't you see? This is where I belong. This is who I am.",
        "Reva: I don't believe that.",
        "Jonathan: Then you're a fool. And that can get you hurt.",
        "Reva: I know.",
        "Nate: And my, how the tables turn. Then turn and turn again. You, I never know which way is up with you, Jonnie. You were just trying to kill me a minute ago.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, well, I guess none of us here are model citizens.",
        "Nate: No, we're not. We are beasts in the jungle, trying to tear each other to shreds. And I will try to remind myself of that the next time I think I have you figured out.",
        "Jonathan: So? What next?",
        "Nate: Well, now we find ourselves at the point of no return. Jonnie, you can't go back. We can't let Reva go back. So my son, my friend, now is the time for you to release the anger, the pent-up frustration. Now is the time for you to finally do what you've been wanting to do for all these years: Kill something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop. Look, that was the first opportunity that I had to talk to Michelle in weeks.",
        "Marina: You couldn't maybe work it in?",
        "Danny: We... we had to talk about Robbie. Then she thought the line was going to cut out. I mean, I didn't think to mention that you and I were moving in together, but it wasn't intentional. I will tell her the next time we talk. All right?",
        "Marina: Okay. It's not that I don't understand. I just think it would be a weird thing for her to come home to.",

        "Dinah: Did you talk to Cassie?",
        "Edmund: Yes, I did, and she agreed to give up the farmhouse for the baby. All we have to do is draw up the final papers.",
        "Dinah: Okay. I'm so thirsty. Could you get me something to drink?",
        "Edmund: I'd be more than happy to. I'll be right back.",
        "Dinah: Okay.",
        "Cassie: Hey. So, you're awake. So, are you feeling okay?",

        "Cassie: What do you mean, \"with everything\"?",

        "Tammy: What?",
        "Sandy: Your locket's missing. The one you always wear right there.",
        "Tammy: You watch your back. Just remember what you already know. I guess I lost it in the water. At least I think I did. So much happened tonight, I'm not even sure.",
        "Sandy: Hm. I'm sorry. I know how much that meant to you.",
        "Tammy: Well, I know I'm never going to see it again. I'd rather not think about it.",

        "Nate: Let me not intrude on the Oedipal drama.",

        "Jonathan: Look, you take all your nobility, all your apologies and all your good intentions, and shove it!",
        "Nate: Reva, if you're really ready to die, I'll be happy to oblige you.",
        "Reva: Look, you heard what my son said! You stay out of this! This is between us. This is your last chance, Jonathan. This is your last chance to break the cycle, to have a real life with people who love you, people who want to give you a home. People who would give anything for another chance.",
