        "Tony: Hey, bro.",
        "Ray: Need a spot?",
        "Tony: No, that's it for me. It's all yours. I'm going for a jog.",
        "Ray: Not a bad idea. Want some company?",
        "Tony: Yeah, why not? If you want.",
        "Ray: Yeah.",
        "Tony: You're getting a little loose.",
        "Ray: Yeah, what can I tell you. I'm a bufforilla-- half buffalo, half gorilla. I can still kick your butt, though.",
        "Tony: Yeah, maybe. Maybe. Let's go.",
        "Ray: Let's roll.",
        "Tony: All right. Hey.",
        "Cassie: Hi, guys.",
        "Tony: How are you doing?",
        "Cassie: Good.",
        "Tammy: Hi, father ray.",
        "Ray: Hi. Have a good workout.",
        "Cassie: Thanks.",
        "Ray: I, on the other hand, have been too busy to work out.",
        "Tony: Yeah?",
        "Ray: Been eating too much arroz con pollo. (Laughter) you look like you've been putting in some serious time in there.",
        "Tony: Well, you know. Working off a lot of stress.",
        "Ray: And frustration? How's michelle doing?",
        "Michelle: Take the job that tony offered you.",
        "Danny: No. I'm not taking that job.",
        "Michelle: Why not?",
        "Danny: Because, michelle, it will be a step backwards to a place I don't want to go.",
        "Michelle: And why do you even care? Everyone thinks you're in the mob, anyway.",
        "Danny: (Sighs) unbelievable. You know, you don't understand now, but...",
        "Michelle: What? What? I would have. Is that what you were going to say? I would have understood if i didn't lose my memory?",
        "Danny: No. Actually, michelle, I was going to say that you will understand eventually.",
        "Michelle: See, that's even worse because you're still waiting for the old michelle to come back.",
        "Danny: That's not what this is about.",
        "Michelle: Yeah. Oh, if I only had my memory, then I'd understand why you insulted tony and turned down the job he offered you when we obviously need the money.",
        "Danny: Money is not a problem. Taking a job from tony would be a very big problem.",
        "Michelle: So it's better to just lose everything?",
        "Danny: We're not going to lose everything. You know, michelle, you don't remember, but you're the reason that I got out of the mob in the first place. You hated that I was in the mob. I did it for you.",
        "Michelle: You're right, i don't remember and maybe I never will remember, and maybe I don't even want to remember.",
        "Harley: I don't believe this. You are the head of the new springfield corporation?",
        "Phillip: Yup. That's me.",
        "Harley: Well, good. Then you can straighten this whole thing out.",
        "Buzz: Yes, please, phillip. Explain. Explain fast.",
        "Phillip: Okay. What seems to be the problem?",
        "Harley: My father was served with these papers.",
        "Buzz: It seems someone in your firm-- we don't know who-- has claimed eminent domain over the property that my restaurant is on.",
        "Phillip: Yeah. I know.",
        "Harley: Well, good. Then make a phone call and stop this thing before they sic the bulldozers on the place.",
        "Phillip: Oh. You know, I'm sorry, but I can't help you with this.",
        "Harley: Why not?",
        "Phillip: Well, because I've got big plans for that part of town, and company is... it's in the way.",
        "Tammy: Oh, nice, mom.",
        "Cassie: Okay, your turn. You try it. Let's go.",
        "Tammy: Oh, I don't think I'll be so good at the boxing thing.",
        "Bill: Lucky for the guys you date.",
        "Tammy: What guys?",
        "Cassie: You know, you're just the man I want to talk to.",
        "Bill: Hey, anything you want, okay? I'm a bleeder, all right.",
        "Cassie: Work on your kicks.",
        "Bill: Lay off. (Laughs) so what's going on with the mother/daughter self- defense training, huh?",
        "Cassie: You know what? Just working out. Had some security issues at the beacon and you can't be too careful.",
        "Bill: Well, hey, you know, maybe you should update that security system I put in at the hotel.",
        "Cassie: That's what I wanted to talk to you about. Can you do it?",
        "Bill: Well, I'm not really doing that kind of work right now, but I can recommend someone for you.",
        "Cassie: Great. I'll call you later and I'll get their name and number. I want to do this as soon as possible.",
        "Bill: Absolutely. Absolutely. You know, I'm going to head home right now if you want to give me a call there.",
        "Cassie: All right.",
        "Bill: All right? Tammy, you go girl.",
        "Cassie: That's great, but you've got to watch your stance. Here. Watch me. Ya!",
        "Tammy: Ooh. Mom, what's up with you? Did edmund do something to tick you off?",
        "Grimes: Sorry I'm late, mr. Ambassador. There was a problem.",
        "Edmund: Did you locate the information I wanted?",
        "Grimes: Tough one, because i couldn't go through normal channels.",
        "Edmund: Well, that's why i gave you the assignment. The U.S. Government isn't exactly enthusiastic about handing information on its agents. What did you find out about jeffrey o'neill?",
        "Grimes: Well, see for yourself.",
        "Jeffrey: Hello! Is anybody home? Bill, you here? Didn't think so. Okay. Sorry about this, bill. Testing one, two, three. Bill, I need you to lead me to your sister. Her father knows where she is. I'm willing to bet you do, too.",
        "Buzz: My company-- my company is in your way?",
        "Phillip: That's right.",
        "Harley: Are you crazy? You can't bulldoze company. Is this a joke?",
        "Phillip: No, it's not a joke. The governor pushed this through himself. Read it again, it's pretty straightforward stuff. Yeah. Yeah, the property that company is on sits squarely in the middle of a proposed redevelopment. But what are you worried about? You're going to make a huge profit. Did you read the fine print?",
        "Buzz: I want my restaurant, not your money.",
        "Phillip: Well, it's actually the government's money. Buzz, what are you so angry about? I know you. It's never been your dream to run a diner. Here's your chance, man. Take the money and run. Go see the world.",
        "Buzz: I've seen the world! I like it here!",
        "Harley: Come on, phillip. Come on. I thought you were the one spaulding we could trust these days.",
        "Phillip: Listen, I'm sorry about the way you found out. I meant to come and tell you myself; it just didn't time out.",
        "Buzz: Haven't you guys done enough? You ruin my son's career. You destroyed her marriage. Isn't that enough?",
        "Phillip: Buzz, why are you making this personal? It's not personal; it's business. Oh, actually I take that back. Part of it is personal.",
        "Harley: I knew it.",
        "Phillip: Yeah. I'm doing this for my children. I'm doing it for lizzie and zach, and james and emma.",
        "Buzz: At the expense of everybody else in this town.",
        "Phillip: Everybody in this town, buzz? Don't you think you're getting a little melodramatic? It's just a restaurant we're talking about, right?",
        "Marina: Hey, guys. What's going on?",
        "Harley: We're listening to phillip tell us how he's going to bulldoze company to redevelop springfield.",
        "Marina: (Laughs) very funny, aunt harley.",
        "Buzz: Oh, it's no joke. Phillip-- or rather spaulding enterprises in collusion with the government-- is closing us down.",
        "Marina: No way. You leave my family alone, you big jerk!",
        "Jeffrey: This bug has got a bug in it. Let's try another one. It's about time you showed up.",
        "Bill: Looks like I need to change these locks again.",
        "Edmund: Jeffrey o'neill hasn't worked as a federal agent for weeks? He's on indefinite leave of absence at his own request? Are you sure of your sources?",
        "Grimes: Yes, sir.",
        "Edmund: Then why did he say he was carrying on an investigation for us in europe when he'd already cut ties with all of his contacts there? More important: What is he still doing in springfield? Because it's clearly not just to be the D.A.",
        "Ray: Have you had any more of those dreams about michelle?",
        "Tony: Ray? Forget I ever mentioned it, all right?",
        "Ray: Sorry.",
        "Tony: Well, you know what? Dreams... dreams are just dreams, ray. You know? And I do want michelle and danny to work out as much as you do.",
        "Ray: I'm sure you do.",
        "Tony: I do. I need you to do me a favor.",
        "Ray: Yeah?",
        "Tony: I need you to talk to danny. Please. I mean, this whole town is going against him. He's in over his head with debt, ray. I tried to help him; he won't let me help him.",
        "Ray: You tried?",
        "Tony: Yeah, I tried to offer him a job. He turned me down cold. Ends up like it always do. We fight, we argue, michelle walks in the door. It's like he thinks I'm trying to show him up, like I'm trying to...",
        "Ray: What, show him up how?",
        "Tony: Look, ray...",
        "Ray: About michelle?",
        "Tony: Ray, a dream is a dream. This is not about michelle. Okay? Danny is under the impression that I want the life that he had, that I want to be boss. Okay?",
        "Ray: Bro, please...",
        "Tony: Okay, all right, fine, yeah. That's what I want, ray. It is. But it's got nothing to do with michelle. She's not a part of the package. I'm telling you, it's danny. He's thinking crazy; he's thinking stupid.",
        "Ray: Is it?",
        "Tony: (Sighs)",
        "Michelle: Look, it sounds like we had a really nice life together. But I may never get my memory back, and I'm cool with that. Are you?",
        "Danny: Michelle... (clears throat)",
        "Michelle: I need to know if you can live with me as I am now.",
        "Danny: Of course I can. I'm your husband. I want to spend the rest of my life with you.",
        "Michelle: Well, you can stop treating me like a barely functioning child and start treating me like your partner.",
        "Danny: That's not what I'm doing. I... I don't know what you want from me.",
        "Michelle: Honesty? Is that really that hard?",
        "Danny: I am being honest with you.",
        "Michelle: No, you're not. Not even close. Okay? You hid the truth about the explosion at the warehouse, and then I had to find a stack of unpaid bills to know we're having money trouble.",
        "Danny: We're not... I'm just trying to make life easy for you so that you can focus on working your way back. That's all I'm trying to do.",
        "Michelle: Are you even listening to me? Okay, there is no \"back.\" I'm not working my way anywhere. There's only right now. Maybe that's just really hard for you to hear? I guess it's a slap in the face to everything that we went through together, but you have to accept that. Or don'T. Or don'T. But just... I just need you to be real with me, and honest. How bad is it?",
        "Danny: It's bad, okay? It's bad. The loans for the fifth street project are coming due and if i don't pay them, we could lose everything. And cassie could lose this hotel, because she cosigned those loans with me. Since the news of the explosion came out, these last 24 hours have been a nightmare. Everybody I had deals with has been bailing on me left and right. Have I made your day yet? Are you glad I'm telling you all this?",
        "Michelle: Yeah. Yeah, I know where we stand. I can help you.",
        "Danny: No, michelle, you can't help me. I... this is my problem. I created it.",
        "Michelle: So much for our having a breakthrough.",
        "Danny: Well, michelle, no offense, but what can you do? Come on.",
        "Michelle: You have no idea what I can or can't do.",
        "Danny: You don't, either. That's my point.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, well I can try. You know, I tried to be this person that you wanted me to be and that didn't work so well, so at least let me try to live in the present and work out some of the problems that we have right now.",
        "Danny: Michelle, I appreciate that you want to help. I do.",
        "Michelle: But you don't trust me. You don't trust the person that I am now.",
        "Danny: That's not true.",
        "Michelle: You know, I'm so sick of pounding my head against the wall.",
        "Danny: Really?",
        "Michelle: Like trying to make this thing work is just too much work, too little payoff.",
        "Danny: Is that what you've been doing?",
        "Michelle: Done.",
        "Danny: You could have fooled me.",
        "Michelle: I'm done.",
        "Harley: Who are you? I feel like I'm talking to alan. I mean, what happened to the guy who came to me on my wedding day and said all those nice things.",
        "Phillip: Harley, stop making this personal. It's not. It's business. And you don't know, this could turn out to be the best thing that ever happens to your family.",
        "Marina: Are you insane?",
        "Phillip: Well, no, not anymore. But thank you for asking. I'll leave those with you. If you read them again, I think you'll see they're more than fair.",
        "Harley: This isn't over, phillip.",
        "Phillip: Look, change is never easy. We'll talk again when you're more calm.",
        "Harley: We're not going to get more calm. We're going to stop you from doing this.",
        "Phillip: Do you really think you can?",
        "Harley: Daddy, no! No! No! No, no.",
        "Ray: Bro, does danny know about that dream you had about michelle?",
        "Tony: Enough. Enough with the dreams, ray. It's not a big deal, okay?",
        "Ray: Maybe not, but what about the way you've been acting since you've come back. You've pulled away from danny. You've done everything you can to show him you're your own boss. You've pretty much shoved your independence in his face. You did.",
        "Tony: So what? I've got my own life now. It doesn't mean that I want the life that danny had. It doesn't mean that I want michelle, all right?",
        "Danny: Yeah. Talk is cheap. But you know what? I still don't buy it.",
        "Tony: Well, you know, danny, fine. Buy it, don't buy it, I don't care. Hey, I offered you a job and you turned me down. I tried to help you.",
        "Danny: So, you know what? Stop helping!",
        "Ray: Come on, guys. Come on.",
        "Danny: Because all your helping is doing is causing a lot of problems.",
        "Tony: You know what? Fine by me.",
        "Danny: In fact, stay away from me and michelle.",
        "Tony: No problem. Fine by me.",
        "Danny: Good.",
        "Tony: You have fun digging yourself out of the hole that you got you and your family into, danny.",
        "Danny: No problem. No problem.",
        "Tony: Okay, good.",
        "Ray: Come on, man. We're family.",
        "Danny: Ray...",
        "Ray: We're family. We can work through this.",
        "Danny: Tell him to start acting like family. No, this is not...",
        "Tony: Oh, I haven't acted like family?",
        "Ray: Bro.",
        "Tony: Really? You know what?",
        "Danny: Good-bye.",
        "Tony: Screw it. I'll see you. I'll talk to you later, ray.",
        "Danny: You have no idea, so don'T. I know you're trying to help, but I've got enough on my plate right now to be thinking about tony. Believe me, I'll deal with him later. I've got to make a call.",
        "Michelle: (Sighs) that's better. No, this is not right. It's not right. ( Cell phone rings)",
        "Tony: Yeah, what's up, michelle?",
        "Michelle: Hey. Can you come down to the lighthouse? I need you.",
        "Bill: If you get busted for breaking and entering, do you prosecute yourself?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that's a very zen question, bill, but I'll save you the 911 call. You see, the door was wide open. You've got to be more careful about locking up when you leave.",
        "Bill: I guess so, huh? Well, why don't you step out in the hallway and we'll test the locks, huh?",
        "Jeffrey: So much for hospitality. We've got to get a couple things straight.",
        "Bill: Not a good time.",
        "Jeffrey: No, bill. Bill, would there be a better time to discuss you going to prison?",
        "Bill: What are you talking about?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I'm talking about a courtroom, a verdict and you behind bars.",
        "Bill: You break into my apartment and I'm the one facing jail time?",
        "Jeffrey: Bill, you're lucky i didn't come here with a warrant, okay, and arrest you for criminal conspiracy.",
        "Bill: Conspiracy? What are you...",
        "Jeffrey: She's a criminal, bill. You think I was just going to let this slide? Coming up on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Jeffrey: So, you just couldn't stay away, could you?",
        "Harley: We cannot just roll over and let the spauldings mow us down. Not this time.",
        "Bill: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Jeffrey: How could you be so stupid? How could you put yourself at risk for her?",
        "Bill: Again, I do not...",
        "Jeffrey: Don't try to defend her, bill. Eden had no right to contact you.",
        "Bill: Eden?",
        "Jeffrey: Or maybe you found a way to contact her first, is that what happened? That would explain all your threats.",
        "Bill: No, listen to me. I would never try to find out where eden was and put her in danger. I'd never put her in harm's way.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, you wouldn't?",
        "Bill: No.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, thank you very much. I was just checking. See you later.",
        "Bill: What, that's it?",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, yeah, that's it. See, you just proved to me that you would never put eden at risk. What else would there be? Oh, wait a minute. Your sister. She's not worth it, bill. Okay? She's a lost cause. Give it up.",
        "Bill: (Sighs)",
        "Dinah: Is it safe?",
        "Bill: For now. How long was he here before i walked in?",
        "Dinah: A few minutes.",
        "Bill: I mean, what was he doing?",
        "Dinah: I couldn't hear. He was mumbling there for a while. That's the D.A., Huh?",
        "Bill: Well, yeah. The one and only.",
        "Dinah: Well, you were out there talking for a while. What did he say?",
        "Bill: Dinah, we've got to get something straight.",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Bill: You told me that you came to springfield to turn yourself in. Well, that was a lie, wasn't it? (Knock at door)",
        "Michelle: What took you so long?",
        "Tony: I had to change. I was at the gym working out. What's going on? You couldn't tell me on the phone, huh?",
        "Michelle: I have an idea.",
        "Tony: What is all this? What's going on, michelle?",
        "Michelle: Oh, forget that. Forget that. Come here. What do you see?",
        "Tony: Water. The lake. What's with you?",
        "Michelle: Okay, I came up with a solution to everything-- not that danny is going to think so but, you know, as far as he's concerned, I'm so whacked out with the memory thing I can't even put two sentences together, but...",
        "Tony: Okay, listen to me. If this is about you and danny...",
        "Michelle: No, no, no. It's not, it's not, it's not. It's not. It's about me. It's about me and it's about what I need, and it's about this place. Come here. Every time I walk into this place, I feel okay, you know? I watch the sunset over the water, I see the lights come on in the city from the observation deck. It just makes me feel better, you know? And if it works for me, why wouldn't it work for other people?",
        "Tony: What people?",
        "Michelle: Anyone. Everyone. Look, we all need a place to feel okay, right? A place where we can unwind, where we can kick back, where we can figure out who we really are.",
        "Tony: So you're thinking about turning this place into a club, huh?",
        "Michelle: Not a club, exactly.",
        "Tony: No?",
        "Michelle: But food, drinks, you know, the whole thing. But for everyone, all ages.",
        "Tony: Bad idea, michelle. No, I'm serious. It's a bad idea. It's a commitment. You've got to be married to this. This is a project, you know?",
        "Michelle: I know, I know, i know. But you've been telling me to make a life for myself, and tony, this is it. I'm telling you, I can do this, tony. I need to do this. There's just one thing that's stopping me.",
        "Tony: And what's that?",
        "Michelle: Convincing you to go in on it with me.",
        "Tony: Mm-hmm.",
        "Dinah: Bill, come on. I'm not lying to you. I had every intention of turning myself in. I wanted to, but I lost my nerve.",
        "Bill: No, I know. I understand, believe me. I don't want to see you go to jail, either.",
        "Dinah: I am sorry I have put you in this position. You took a great chance of hiding me here.",
        "Bill: Dinah, let me tell you something. It's worth it just to see you again and try to help you.",
        "Dinah: Look, it doesn'T... you have no idea what it means to have you on my side.",
        "Bill: I just wish I had better luck with the D.A. I wish there was more that i could do, but I...",
        "Dinah: I know.",
        "Bill: (Sighs)",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Bill: O'neill was not here because of eden. He's trying to find out if I've been in contact with you. That's what's going on.",
        "Dinah: I know that, too.",
        "Bill: Which means that you are not safe. And I hate to say it, but I...",
        "Dinah: You don't have to. My dad already did. I have to disappear.",
        "Bill: I mean, today, that was a close call, but next time, who knows, you know? Listen, I'm going to miss you, but I really do, I think you're safer if you leave.",
        "Dinah: Hey, look, you're right. You're right. You are very smart, you're very grown-up, and you're my hero.",
        "Bill: You know, it doesn't mean that this is over. I mean, some day, we could...",
        "Dinah: No, I know. Maybe, you know... look, I want you to know that the time that you have spent with me has meant the world, and I will not forget what you did for me.",
        "Bill: Listen, if you're going to start packing, why don't i run out and get us some food and just have a last meal as a family?",
        "Dinah: Okay. Yeah, I like that idea.",
        "Bill: Okay. I'll be right back, okay? You are going to be here when i get back, right?",
        "Dinah: Where else would I go?",
        "Edmund: What have you two been up to?",
        "Tammy: We've been at the gym.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. You should come with us next time. I could teach you a few things.",
        "Tammy: Well, I think I'll stick to fencing just the same.",
        "Tammy: Smart move. Sensei winslow over here is a killer. I think I need a protein shake to recover. Is it okay if I go sign for one in the bar?",
        "Cassie: Yes. Go ahead.",
        "Edmund: So, you're teaching your daughter to defend herself. That's good.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. You never know when she may need to use it.",
        "Edmund: Well, if you're concerned about her safety, i suppose you could just ask jeffrey o'neill to look after her, too. Unless, of course, you think that's stretching his bodyguard duties a bit too thin?",
        "Cassie: He's only trying to help us, edmund.",
        "Edmund: Yes, by sticking very close to you. You know, it's funny. We managed to get closer to finding the people who were threatening you-- the identity thieves-- when we were in venice than he's managed to do in weeks. Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?",
        "Cassie: No, it doesn'T. I trust that he can keep us safe.",
        "Edmund: Really? Who's doing the protecting here, cassie?",
        "Cassie: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Edmund: It means I'm just commenting on the fact that you seem to have bought entirely into his hero act. But I think you're more the bodyguard here.",
        "Michelle: Well?",
        "Tony: (Sighs) it's a bad idea, michelle. I'm sorry.",
        "Michelle: No, no, no. Tony, this is a great idea. Come here.",
        "Tony: Oh, come on.",
        "Michelle: Go ahead. Look. I want you to look out there.",
        "Tony: Okay. All right, all right.",
        "Michelle: You can see everything.",
        "Tony: I can. You're right.",
        "Michelle: And for years, the whole town has been looking up at this lighthouse. Now we can give them a chance to look past their troubles, past the things that keep them chained down, you know? I mean, the layout is perfect. You've got the informal down here with the food and the drinks, and then upstairs can be for the romantic.",
        "Tony: (Laughs) you're serious, right?",
        "Michelle: Yes!",
        "Tony: Of course. And then there's michelle with her long list of experiences, right?",
        "Michelle: Well, what I lack in experience, I make up for with confidence. I mean, I don't see what the big deal is, you know? I like food. I can pretend to like people.",
        "Tony: There's more to it than that, michelle. There is.",
        "Michelle: Tony santos, I do believe you're afraid.",
        "Tony: No. Afraid? Me? No, never. (Laughs) I'm not, all right? It's just that I know in my world it's called playing it safe. It's called being smart. Michelle, listen, I don't get myself involved in anything-- anything-- if I know that it's doomed to fail. Okay? I'm not afraid.",
        "Michelle: Well, see, that's the great thing about having amnesia because I don't remember what it feels like to fail. So fear doesn't even factor in for me. And besides, I've got enough ambition for the both of us. Come on.",
        "Tony: Okay. Okay, all right. So, let's say that we do this.",
        "Michelle: Yes!",
        "Tony: No, hold on now. All right? Danny's not going to be happy with me loaning you money, you taking front money from me.",
        "Michelle: Hey, listen. Danny doesn't like a lot of things about me. I want to prove to him, though, that I can bring in income-- my way. He's not going to be able to get us out of the kind of trouble we're in on his own, anyway.",
        "Tony: Michelle, you know that when I offered danny the job, he turned me down because of one thing and one thing only: My money is not clean. All right?",
        "Michelle: Well, money is money, and as far as I'm concerned, it's all about what you do with it that matters. And this is a good thing, tony. I'm telling you. And, you know, no bank is going to give me a loan anyway, with the kind of outstanding debt we have.",
        "Tony: Oh, I see. So I'm dumber than the average bank, that's what you're telling me?",
        "Michelle: No. You just know a good thing when you see it.",
        "Tony: Maybe. Maybe. Michelle, doing business my way, it's not... it's not normal, all right? It's not a good way to do business.",
        "Michelle: Oh, yeah. Because of why? Because if I don't turn a profit, you're going to come and break my legs?",
        "Tony: No, not exactly. I'd just have somebody else come and do it.",
        "Danny: Yeah, I know. I'll get you your money. I'm working on it. Okay, thanks. Bill. Hey. How are you doing? You got a minute?",
        "Bill: If it's about michelle, yeah.",
        "Danny: Well, yeah, actually it affects michelle.",
        "Bill: Okay, I'm listening.",
        "Danny: Good. Well, you know, I've been thinking about the way we worked together when I ran for mayor and...",
        "Bill: (Laughs) yeah, that worked out real well.",
        "Danny: Bill?",
        "Bill: Yeah?",
        "Danny: I did what I had to do, you know that. I'm still paying for it.",
        "Bill: Yeah, we all are, aren't we, danny?",
        "Danny: (Sighs) look, I have not forgotten about all the great ideas that we had for this town, and I was just thinking that if we put our skills together, we could really make them happen. What do you say? Fifth street still needs to be finished. We could start there and really do something for this community. What do you think?",
        "Bill: Sure. Yeah, sure. Why not?",
        "Danny: Yeah?",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Danny: You mean it?",
        "Bill: Yeah. We'll drop everything we're doing, we'll work day and night, I'll put all my energy into it and just when things look like they're really taking off, you can cut and run and leave me holding the bag, just like before. Yeah, that's a great idea. Why didn't I think of it?",
        "Buzz: For crying out loud, it's a place, you know? Roof, walls. Why get so worked up?",
        "Marina: I love this place.",
        "Buzz: Things happen for a reason. Come on, let's have some coffee.",
        "Harley: Dad, there's got to be something we can do about this. This is our town, too, right?",
        "Buzz: When the diner burned down for the second time, i never felt so helpless in all my life. It was like I lost a little piece of me that died, you know? But then this place came on the market and it's been great. Maybe phillip is right, you know? Maybe it's time to move on.",
        "Marina: You can say that until you're purple and I won't believe you.",
        "Harley: Don't worry. He doesn't believe it, either.",
        "Buzz: You cannot fight city hall.",
        "Marina: But we can fight the spauldings, right? I mean, the whole town will come out on our side. Everyone loves this place.",
        "Harley: Yeah. So does he.",
        "Buzz: I love alex. I had to let her go. This is a restaurant. Think about what I could do with the cash. I could put you through college, graduate school. We could finally take a real family vacation, you know? The islands, fishing, cruises to alaska. I'd never have to burn another burger.",
        "Harley: You love to burn those burgers.",
        "Buzz: (Groans)",
        "Harley: You live for it. And what would you do with yourself every day if you didn't have this place to come to? Dad, don't take their blood money. You'll be so sorry if you give up.",
        "Marina: Spauldings against the coopers. We'll knock them out of the box.",
        "Buzz: I don't know if I have it in me for another knock-down, drag-out.",
        "Harley: Well, that's because you think the spauldings are too big to fight.",
        "Marina: But they're not, right?",
        "Harley: Right. No, this time we have something actually working in our favor, and I'm going after it with everything I've got.",
        "Edmund: Cassie? Cassie, wait. Wait. Wait, wait.",
        "Cassie: What is going on with you, edmund? Huh? I am not protecting jeffrey, but I'm glad he's around to be doing his job.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, when it comes to you and the children, I have protective instincts of my own.",
        "Cassie: I know, edmund. I know. And I am... I'm so sorry.",
        "Edmund: I'm sorry. I'm sorry I sounded off about jeffrey o'neill, and I didn't mean to question your judgment.",
        "Cassie: Does this mean that you won't object to my upgrading the security system here?",
        "Edmund: No, of course not.",
        "Cassie: Good, because i already spoke to bill about it.",
        "Edmund: Bill? Bill lewis is doing installations of this kind anymore?",
        "Cassie: No, not anymore but he has someone he can recommend, and I did tell him I would call him to get the name and the address, because I want to deal with this as soon as possible.",
        "Edmund: Hm. Well, there's something we agree on, at any rate. (Telephone rings)",
        "Bill: Hi. I can't take your call right now, but wait for the beep. You know what to do. (Answering machine beeps)",
        "Cassie: Bill? It's cassie. Are you there? Pick up if you are, okay? (Telephone picks up) oh, good. You are there. Look, I was just calling you again about the, um... hello? Bill? I can't hear you. It may be my cell phone. I'll call you back later. That was weird. His answering machine picked up and then someone else picked up and nobody said anything.",
        "Edmund: All right, well, let's go inside and use the hotel phone.",
        "Cassie: No. I'm going to go over there and i want to talk to him because i want this taken care of asap.",
        "Edmund: Jeffrey o'neill really has you spooked about this, doesn't he?",
        "Cassie: Look, edmund, I don't know why that planter fell. But something could have happened to rj, okay, and i don't want to take any chances.",
        "Edmund: All right, that's a good point. Look, I'll drive you over there unless you want to go alone.",
        "Cassie: No. Come with me. Come on.",
        "Dinah: Jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: When you're trying to hide from someone, you should lay off the perfume. It's a dead giveaway.",
        "Harley: We cannot just roll over and let the spauldings mow us down. Not this time. I say if you're going to take out a spaulding, you need another spaulding in your corner.",
        "Marina: Who?",
        "Buzz: No! Don't do it. It's not worth it.",
        "Harley: Dad, I don't have a choice. And he owes me. He's got alan wrapped around his finger and he can make sure that phillip's little redevelopment plan crashes down around his feet.",
        "Marina: Aunt harley, no. Not...",
        "Harley: Gus. Yes. I've got to go. I've got to do it.",
        "Buzz: After what you've been through? You want to go toe-to-toe with a guy you're trying to forget?",
        "Harley: You know, dad, whatever else he's done, he is not going to let phillip get away with this. I know him. I've got to do this. We need him and I'm going to get him. Wish me luck.",
        "Danny: Bill, what are you going to do? Are you going to spend the rest of your life resenting me? What's that going to do for you?",
        "Bill: All you had to do was level with me.",
        "Danny: Bill, o'neill and the feds had me cornered. I had to do what they wanted or innocent people were going to get hurt.",
        "Bill: But they did anyway, danny. They did anyway. Like your wife. And none of this would have happened if you didn't make those deals with salerno behind my back. You swore to me... no, you swore to me that you were clean.",
        "Danny: Yes, I know I did. I'm clean now.",
        "Bill: Oh. And I'm supposed to believe that? Just take it on faith? What?",
        "Danny: Bill, what have you got to lose? You're not working with tony anymore, you're out of lewis construction...",
        "Bill: Yeah, but you are not and you are one of the reasons why I left lewis construction, you understand?",
        "Danny: Well, it's funny you should mention that.",
        "Bill: What? Oh.",
        "Danny: Because...",
        "Bill: My uncle saw the light and he cut you loose and now you have nowhere else to go, so here you are chasing me down, practically begging because...",
        "Danny: I'm not begging.",
        "Bill: Yes, you are.",
        "Danny: I'm not chasing you down.",
        "Bill: Yes, you are.",
        "Danny: I have fifth street.",
        "Bill: Fifth street? Danny, please. No one would loan you the capital to get the work done. You have nothing and pretty soon you won't even have michelle, because after everything that you put her...",
        "Danny: Don't push it, bill.",
        "Bill: Let me tell you something, after everything you put her through, you think she's going to stand by a guy that she doesn't even remember when the whole town turns against him? Huh?",
        "Michelle: This is going to be the hottest place in town. People are going to be lined up across the beach to get in here. We'll be turning a profit in no time.",
        "Tony: Says your crystal ball.",
        "Michelle: You haven't even heard the best part yet. There is going to be a whole space just for you.",
        "Tony: For me? I have a home, michelle.",
        "Michelle: It's not a home. It's not a home. It's an office.",
        "Tony: An office?",
        "Michelle: You're always telling me that the police are watching the social club, right? Well, the lighthouse is isolated so you can set up a desk right up here.",
        "Tony: A desk?",
        "Michelle: And you can see the cops coming, close up shop before they even cross the sand.",
        "Tony: (Laughs) you've been watching way too many mobster flicks, all right?",
        "Michelle: You're the one who told me you were looking for a new location. Tony, this is it. It's perfect.",
        "Tony: You're killing me.",
        "Michelle: Is that a yes?",
        "Tony: You got a name for the place yet?",
        "Michelle: Um...",
        "Tony: Hm?",
        "Michelle: I don't know. I thought we could come up with it together. Something with \"lighthouse\" in it?",
        "Tony: Lighthouse hideout? Going to the mattresses with tony and michelle?",
        "Michelle: Well, less is more, I think. You know, something simple like light.",
        "Tony: Not bad.",
        "Michelle: Yeah? Yeah? So, what do you think? What do you think? Is that a yes? It's meant to be. Come on. Is that a yes?",
        "Tony: Hey. Hey. All right, it's not a no, okay? It's not a no.",
        "Michelle: Oh, tony. Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.",
        "Tony: You bet.",
        "Michelle: Thank you.",
        "Tony: You bet.",
        "Jeffrey: So, you just couldn't stay away, could you?",
        "Dinah: Well, you wouldn't help me so I had to do something.",
        "Jeffrey: No one can help you anymore. You've gone too far.",
        "Dinah: If you let me walk out that door right now, nobody has to know.",
        "Jeffrey: What did you think you could accomplish by coming back here? Hm? Answer me. Well, I guess I just couldn't stay away from you.",
        "Cassie: Olivia said that bill redid the apartment, so I can't wait to see what's going on in there.",
        "Edmund: Hm. Next, on \"guiding light.\"",
        "Danny: I'm sick and tired of all your comments about michelle.",
        "Bill: Yeah? Well, let me tell you something. Do you hear me? (Arguing)",
        "Olivia: Back off! Both of you, back off! What's going on?",
        "Cassie: What is going on in there?"
