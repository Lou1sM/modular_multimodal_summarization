        "Dinah: So let me get this right. You don't\r\nknow anything about the fire and I don't know anything about your past? ",
        "Jeffrey: Right. Something like that. ",
        "Dinah: Something? Jeffrey, don't play with\r\nme, I'll play right back. ",
        "Mallet: She plays hard. ",
        "Dinah: Honey, what are you doing here? You\r\njust got out of the hospital. You should be at home, in bed. ",
        "Mallet: No, I didn't want to miss anything.\r\nYou know how it is. Cops can never rest, there's always stuff going down all\r\nover the place. You know, stuff that needs investigating. Drug deals,\r\nhomicides, robberies, fires. ",

        "Reva: Come in. Oh, Billy. Which dress? ",
        "Billy: Ah, red dress. That's your color. ",
        "Reva: Are you sure? Because this may be the\r\nlast dress that they ever... okay, red it is. Any sign of pop and Dylan? ",
        "Billy: They'll be here. Everybody except Josh.\r\n",
        "Reva: I don't want to talk about Josh right\r\nnow because tonight is about seeing my kids and my pop. It's about just being\r\nmyself. ",
        "Billy: Yourself. Yourself without Josh?\r\nYourself without cancer? The self you want to be, but you're not. ",
        "Reva: My self the way I want them to\r\nremember me. The Reva who isn't sick, the Reva who loves to laugh, the Reva who\r\ncan put on a red dress and become the life of the party. That's how I want them\r\nto remember me, not some pathetic, weak shell. ",
        "Billy: You know, I think it's just a little\r\npathetic, all this hiding. I mean, I'm not sure I can go along with it anymore.\r\n",
        "Reva: Billy, think about all the people that\r\nwe've known who were sick and dying. Think about seeing them in their caskets.\r\nWhen you walked away, what do you remember most? You remember what they looked\r\nlike the last time you saw them, right? Well, this is how I want my kids to\r\nremember me. And if you don't want to help me with this, then just excuse\r\nyourself and go home, Billy. What's it going to be? ",
        "Billy: You know I'm not going to leave you. ",
        "Reva: Okay. Tonight is about me making sure\r\nthey never forget me. ",

        "Cassie: Is this really happening? ",
        "Josh: Only if you want it to. ",
        "Cassie: You know I want it to. But are you\r\nsure about this? ",
        "Josh: I want to be with you, Cassie, and\r\nnothing is going to change my mind about that. Nothing. ",
        "",
        "Reva: I almost look like me. ",
        "Billy: I wouldn't kick you out of bed. ",
        "Reva: I just wish that... ",
        "Billy: Wish what? ",
        "Reva: No. I'm not going to think about Josh\r\nand Cassie because when I do I just want to break something. Tonight is about\r\nwhat I do have, not what I don't have. And what I do have are the most\r\namazingly beautiful children in the world. And Josh and Cassie I'll deal with\r\nsoon enough. ",
        "",
        "Cassie: What about Reva? ",
        "Josh: This isn't about Reva. What Reva\r\ndecides-- whatever it is-- it doesn't matter anymore. This is all that matters.\r\n",

        "Jonathan: What do you want? ",
        "Lizzie: You had dirt on your face. A smudge.\r\n",
        "Jonathan: Which you knew because you sat\r\ndown on the bed next to me. ",
        "Lizzie: Okay, I had a cramp, okay? And I sat\r\ndown. Is that a crime? Let me go. ",
        "Jonathan: (Laughs) ",
        "Lizzie: Ow! Ow! See, it's back. Ow! ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. ",
        "Lizzie: It is! ",
        "Jonathan: Stretch out your leg. ",
        "Lizzie: I can't, it hurts. ",
        "Jonathan: Stretch it out. ",
        "Lizzie: It hurts. ",
        "Jonathan: Just stretch it out. Now, if this\r\ndoesn't work, we're going to amputate. ",
        "Lizzie: Ow, it's cold. You know, I know this\r\nmight not be one of your favorite activities, but I do appreciate everything\r\nyou've been doing for me. ",
        "Beth: Hello? ",
        "Alan: Well, I... I hope we're not disturbing\r\nanything. ",
        "",
        "Dinah: I think that my fianc\u00e9 is the bravest\r\nman on the planet. I think he deserves a medal, don't you? ",
        "Mallet: No, sweetheart, I'm just doing my\r\njob. You know how it is, Jeffrey, you see a lead, you jump all over it, right? \r\n",
        "Jeffrey: Right. Well, I got to get back to\r\ncampaigning. Got to boost those poll numbers up, you know? Glad you're up and\r\nabout. Dinah, always a pleasure doing business with you. ",
        "Dinah: Right. ",
        "Mallet: What was that all about? ",
        "Dinah: Ah, it's just Spaulding business. ",
        "Mallet: Yeah, that's what you were talking\r\nabout? ",
        "Dinah: No. I was actually telling him how\r\nmuch I get turned on when you grill me. ",
        "",
        "Josh: Maybe that's because we're in a\r\npalace. ",
        "Cassie: No, I mean... none of this makes\r\nsense. I heard the message you left for Reva. ",
        "Josh: The message? ",
        "Cassie: Yeah, you were on your cell phone\r\nand you told her that life is too short and that you need to see her. ",
        "Josh: (Chuckles) Yes, I know I left a\r\nmessage for Reva, you're right, and I did tell her I needed to see her, but\r\nthat was because of you. I was going to tell her about you, but obviously you\r\nthought... ",
        "Cassie: Hey, it's not like I overreacted or\r\nanything, I just sold my house and took a job in another country. ",
        "Josh: Perfectly logical response. ",
        "Cassie: But I had to. I had to go, I had to\r\nleave you to be with... ",
        "Josh: Reva. It's okay to say her name. I\r\nthink. It's also okay to be happy. ",
        "Cassie: Is it? You are the love of her life.\r\n",
        "Josh: Cassie, I think that you probably will\r\nunderstand this. You already do understand it better than anybody. Reva is a\r\npart of me, and that's never going to change, and I will always love her. But,\r\nI realized something today. It's simple, really. I deserve to be happy-- not\r\njust next week or next month, whenever Reva decides to come home, but right\r\nnow, in the present-- with someone who understands me and who shares my dreams\r\nand who seemingly wants to be with me each and every day. We didn't ask for\r\nthis. But here it is, and I am happy, and it does feel right. ",

        "Hawk: If you like 'em pale. What's with the\r\nnew hair? ",
        "Reva: I'm just trying out a new look. ",
        "Billy: She's always experimenting, that's\r\nall. ",
        "Dylan: You know, I like it. It's very\r\nstylish and kind of sophisticated, and... ",
        "Hawk: And tired looking. Like she hadn't had\r\na wink of sleep. ",
        "Reva: Hey, would you just give me a big hug,\r\nyou old coot! ",

        "Billy: They're over at the show. So, how're Bridget\r\nand Peter? ",

        "Lizzie: He's telling the truth. I invited\r\nthem. ",
        "Jonathan: You did? Why? ",
        "Lizzie: I wanted a safe place to talk to\r\nthem. I want my money back. ",
        "Alan: Your father set aside that money to\r\nprotect you when you matured, Elizabeth, and from what I've observed lately,\r\nyou haven\u2019t. ",
        "Lizzie: Do you think if I'm broke that I\r\nwill come home? Because I won\u2019t. I have friends now. People who actually care\r\nabout me. I am staying here, and I'll get my money back. ",
        "Alan: Not according to section 5, paragraph\r\n8. You see, I have the power to withhold your funds. ",
        "Beth: It's true, Lizzie. Alan is the\r\nexecutive. ",
        "Alan: I can freeze your assets if your\r\nbehavior indicates that you're not of a right mind. I can also insist that you\r\nseek professional help at once. ",
        "Lizzie: So what, are you going to send me\r\naway to another one of those camps? ",
        "Beth: You're too old for camp, Lizzie. ",
        "Lizzie: Then what? You're going to send me\r\nto one of those places that my daddy went to? ",
        "Jonathan: Hey, they're not going to send you\r\nanywhere. ",

I just need you to\r\npromise me that as my oldest that you will look out for Marah and Shayne, and\r\nespecially Jonathan. You were a young dad, and he needs someone like you\r\naround.
