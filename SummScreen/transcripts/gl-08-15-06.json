        "Dinah: Honey, where have you been? ",
        "Mallet: Down on Main Street. ",
        "Dinah: I've been worried about you. ",
        "Mallet: You didn't get my note? ",
        "Dinah: Yeah. It said that something came up,\r\nthat you were working on a case, but nothing about not coming home last night. \r\n",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I just didn't know, you know,\r\nhow the whole thing would go down. ",
        "Dinah: Oh. Was it a stakeout or something? ",
        "Mallet: No, it was just, you know, police\r\nbusiness. Listen, why don't you come down here and meet me in, like, half an\r\nhour in front of the movie theater? ",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Yeah, that sounds great. That\r\nsounds great. Yeah, can't wait. ",
        "Mallet: Okay. Yeah, same here. Uh, anyway,\r\nI'm sorry, Inspector, what were you saying? ",
        "Fire inspector: Well, based on our initial\r\ninspection, the Beacon fire looks suspicious. ",
        "Mallet: Right. Let me ask you: When you were\r\nchecking out my room, did any of your people take out my clothes from the\r\ndresser drawers, you know, maybe to use as evidence? ",
        "Fire inspector: This is the first I'm\r\nhearing about it. There weren't any remnants in the drawers. ",
        "Mallet: Right. Well, you know, it's probably\r\nno big deal. No problem. Someone probably went in there after the fire to mooch\r\nmy threads, which I can understand because I'm a very snazzy dresser. ",
        "",
        "Tammy: Okay, you can look now. ",
        "Jonathan: I have been looking. ",
        "Tammy: Yeah, I know. You ready to hit the\r\nbeach? ",
        "Jonathan: Mm-hmm. (Gives her a raspberry) ",
        "Tammy: Lizzie? ",
        "Lizzie: It's still there! ",
        "Jonathan: What? ",
        "Lizzie: That black car. Don't let them see\r\nyou. It's been down there for hours. It's one of granddad's guys. I'm sure of\r\nit. ",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie, chill. It's the car\r\nservice that Olivia uses for the hotel guests. ",
        "Lizzie: What if that's all part of the plan?\r\nI mean, the three of us have to stick together. Are you going to the pool? \r\n",
        "Tammy: Beach. Do you want to come? ",
        "Lizzie: And lay there like inflate-o-girl\r\nnext to you in that? I'd rather be kidnapped. ",
        "Jonathan: How long do you think this hormone\r\nthing is going to last for? ",
        "",
        "Cassie: Okay, wait, wait, wait. ",
        "Josh: Cassie, it's okay. We can do this. ",
        "Cassie: I don't know. It sounded like a\r\nreally good idea when we thought of it, to spend the whole day together and see\r\nhow it feels, but that was in San Cristobel, 1,000 miles away. Not in Springfield\r\nwhere everybody knows us, and now we're here. ",
        "Josh: We'll take it one cup of coffee at a\r\ntime. It'll be fine, I promise. I'll tell you what, why don't you go inside,\r\nget us a table, all right? ",
        "Cassie: All right. You're not whimping out,\r\nare you? ",
        "Josh: No, I just... I have to do this. ",
        "Cassie: Okay, yeah. ",
        "",
        "Reva: Well, I had a great time, too, Marah.\r\nOkay. Okay, well, you have a safe flight. Bon voyage, my beautiful baby girl. I\r\nlove you, honey. Just always remember that. I love you. ",
        "",
        "Josh: Well, I got your voice mail. What a\r\nsurprise. Okay, I really didn't want to do this by leaving a message. In fact,\r\nI really don't want to do this at all, but I guess we don't really get to\r\nchoose the way things are going to go sometimes, so here it goes. Reva, I had\r\nhope for us when we tore up those divorce papers, but it seems obvious to me\r\nthat you weren't ready for that. You left town, ran away, moved on, that kind\r\nof thing. So I just wanted to leave you this message to say that you don't have\r\nto hurry back to Springfield because I am also moving on. I'll always care\r\nabout you, okay? But I can\u2019t... I just want to be clear about things from now\r\non. Call me back. ",
        "Cassie: Did you do it? ",
        "Josh: Well, I got her voice mail, which I\r\nthink was fitting. So, why are you not sitting down? ",
        "Cassie: I wanted to wait for you. And,\r\nfortunately, it's not too crowded. ",
        "Buzz: Whoa, table for six? ",
        "Josh: I'm sorry, for six? ",
        "Buzz: Well, you know, all your plans and\r\nmodels and everything, you know, that got spread... ",
        "Josh: Oh, yeah. ",
        "Buzz: Joke's funny. ",
        "Josh: Very funny. No, no, no. This is\r\nactually not a business thing. In fact, we would like... we would like a nice\r\nquiet table for two. ",
        "Buzz: Okay. How's Reva? ",
        "",
        "Reva: You could barely stand up, but you did\r\nit. You got to see your kids. You've come this far. You can do this. You can\r\nmake it home so you can face Josh and Cassie. ",

        "Lizzie: Buzz. ",

        "Dylan: Think younger and a lot\r\nbetter-looking. ",
        "Reva: Dylan. Give me a second. I... I\r\noverslept. ",
        "Dylan: Hey. ",
        "Reva: Morning. ",
        "Dylan: Hi. I bought you breakfast. Do you\r\nstill like blueberry pancakes? ",
        "Reva: I ate already. ",
        "Dylan: I thought you just said you\r\noverslept. ",
        "Reva: I... are you going to come in, or\r\nwhat? ",
        "Dylan: Yeah. ",
        "Hawk: Hold that door! Ha ha! I just came to\r\nsay good-bye. ",
        "Reva: I'm so glad you were here, Pop. ",
        "Hawk: Me, too. Just sorry Josh couldn't have\r\nmade this shindig. Sister, you're going to call me if you need me to fix\r\nanything, or anybody? ",
        "Reva: Yeah, I promise. You have a safe trip.\r\n",
        "Dylan: Hey, maybe we ought to let her get\r\ndressed, huh? ",
        "Hawk: Yeah. ",
        "Dylan: Yeah. We'll see you downstairs. ",
        "Reva: No, wait. ",
        "Dylan: What? ",
        "Reva: Just... just stay here for a while and\r\nlet's talk. ",
        "Dylan: Well, finally. About time you two\r\ntold me the truth. ",
        "",
        "Cassie: Josh, on that message to Reva, you didn\u2019t...\r\n? ",
        "Josh: Tell her about us? No. No. That's\r\ngoing to be a face-to- face conversation when it happens, but I told you it\r\ndoesn't matter. Thank you. ",
        "Buzz: Sure. (Cell phone rings) ",
        "Josh: Oh. It's Wanda. I'll take it outside.\r\nExcuse me. Yeah? ",
        "Buzz: I have a question. ",
        "Cassie: I know. Josh didn't really answer\r\nyour question about Reva. Well, that's kind of a hard one to answer, since\r\nshe's who knows where, apparently off on a joyride with Billy. ",
        "Buzz: Billy, really? ",
        "Cassie: Yeah. I mean, as far we can tell.\r\nShe's barely been in contact with any of us, not that we can't figure out what\r\nshe's up to. ",
        "Buzz: Which is? ",
        "Cassie: She knows that Josh is in the middle\r\nof the biggest, most important project of his life, but she doesn't seem to\r\ncare. Which is why, frankly, I have been working with him so much. I mean,\r\npartly why. Originally because he's always been so incredibly good to me and I\r\nwanted to help him in his time of need, but then now there\u2019s... ",
        "Buzz: Yeah? ",
        "Cassie: We've gotten closer, a lot. Now, I\r\nrealize a lot of people are going to be very upset about that-- maybe\r\neverybody, in fact. But you know what? Josh is a wonderful man. He deserves to\r\nbe happy, and if I make him happy then that should be enough for all of you\r\nnaysayers and gossips, who are just set on holding onto the past, so don't\r\neven... don't even start with me. ",
        "Josh: Hey. Hey, hey, hey, it's okay. It's\r\nokay. Listen, I'm going to say this one time, all right? I understand that you\r\nhave a loyalty to Reva-- I get that-- but this is not about her. Life is short,\r\nand, quite frankly, I'm not going to live another day of it unhappy. So if you\r\nhave a problem with that, you take it up with me, not with her. I'm not hungry\r\nanymore. Are you? ",
        "Cassie: No, I'm not. ",
        "Josh: Do you want to just go for a walk or\r\nsomething? That'd be good? ",

        "Mallet: Missed you, too. That was... sorry,\r\nthat was crazy last night. ",
        "Dinah: That's okay. But you know what? I\r\nthink what we should do is go ahead and erase that last night since it's all\r\nover, and I think you should spend the entire day with moi. Okay? ",
        "Mallet: Mm-hm. ",
        "Dinah: Get that crappy little cop stuff out\r\nof your head. ",
        "Mallet: Yeah, that would be nice, yeah. ",
        "Dinah: Yeah. You know what? Let's just go in\r\nnow. Let's go check the flick out. Let's go. ",

        "Mallet: Well, it's really all I have to wear\r\nsince all my clothes are at the cleaners you sent them to. Which... well, I\r\nassume that's where they are because I went back to the Beacon to see what I\r\ncould salvage, you know, and all my dresser drawers were empty. ",
        "Dinah: You know what? We need to go\r\nshopping. We need to go shopping. We need to lay you in a whole new wardrobe. I\r\ncould even sneak into the dressing room, and that is better than any film, I\r\nguarantee. Come on. ",

        "Dinah: Definitely, definitely a good\r\ntactical move. You have to eat something before you go shopping. You can never\r\nhave a French fry craving when you're looking for clothes. You know why? You\r\ngot to take everything back. Nothing fits. It clouds the judgment. ",
        "Mallet: It's true, it's true. I'm kind of\r\nfull. You want to go? Let's get out of here? ",

        "Mallet: Fire inspector. Well, it was just\r\nkind of more of a question rather than a lead. ",
        "Fire inspector: Well, it was very helpful,\r\nanyway. I rechecked your room-- the mattress pad, the bedspread, the sheets.\r\nThey were all absent from the scene. ",
        "Mallet: Right. Well, you know what? It's\r\nlike I said before. It's probably a looter. ",
        "Fire inspector: Or someone trying to cover\r\nup the ignition site. ",
        "Mallet: Or, you know, I was thinking, maybe\r\nmy stuff got tossed to the side when the firemen went in to try to knock down\r\nthe flames, or... you know what? I don't even remember. I don't think my\r\nclothes were even there. ",

        "Josh: Oh, yeah. That's a very, very good\r\nthing. You see, I used to think that Reva thought of calmness as a character\r\ndefect, you know? ",
        "(Cassie laughs) ",
        "Josh: As if she never wanted a single moment\r\nof serenity in her life. Not that I ever really knew what she wanted in life.\r\nOf course, she wanted her freedom. We have to stop talking about Reva now. \r\n",
        "Cassie: No, it's okay. ",
        "Josh: No, I appreciate that, but this is our\r\nday. This is our practice day together. It's supposed to be about us, not about\r\nher. ",
        "Cassie: And you'd rather have that\r\nstillness, huh? ",
        "Josh: Yeah. This is a lot easier than I\r\nthought it was going to be. ",
        "Cassie: It is. ",
        "Josh: Yeah. There's no rioting in the\r\nstreets, there's no protesters chanting in opposition. I mean, it would be hard\r\nfor me to imagine anybody who would take away from us this... the fact that we\r\ndeserve to be as happy as we are right now. ",
        "Hawk: Well. Ain't this cozy? ",
        "Josh: Excuse me for just a second. What are\r\nyou doing here? ",
        "Hawk: Feeling sick to my stomach at the\r\nmoment. You two ought to be ashamed of yourselves! ",
        "Josh: Okay, first of all, you don't know\r\nwhat you're talking about. ",
        "Hawk: I know what I see. You here, with your\r\npaws all over your wife's sister, while Reva\u2019s up in New York trying to pretend\r\nher heart ain't broke. ",
        "Josh and Cassie: What? Reva's in New York? ",
        "Hawk: She went up to see Marah. Shayne\r\nshowed up, too. And Dylan, and me. We had a real old family get together... without\r\nyou, of course. Which is just as well. ",
        "Josh: Reva was in New York with our children\r\nand I didn't know about it. ",
        "Hawk: Maybe she tried to tell you, but you\r\nwas too, how do you say? Preoccupied? ",
        "Josh: Okay, just stop, okay? Stop. ",
        "Hawk: We had a grand old time up there in\r\nthe big apple. Yeah, Billy said it was the kind of time we should be spending\r\ntogether all the time. ",
        "Josh: Oh, Billy was there, too. How nice. ",
        "Cassie: Okay, okay. How is Reva? ",
        "Hawk: Like you give a hoot. ",
        "Josh: Hey! ",
        "Cassie: Just answer me. Is she okay? ",
        "Hawk: She said she was. I didn't buy it. I\r\nknew the minute I walked in that room there was something off with her. The gal\r\nwas just... just dulled down. But now I know why. She's been stabbed in the\r\nback by the two people she loved most in this world. ",
        "Josh: That's crazy, Hawk. ",
        "Hawk: What, you thought she wouldn't care? ",
        "Josh: No, what I'm saying is she doesn't\r\nknow about this. All right? She hasn't been here in months, we've barely had a\r\nconversation during that time, certainly not about... what? ",
        "Cassie: Maybe she does. You did see her in\r\nthe airport. ",
        "Hawk: Oh, this is the way it started, isn't\r\nit? A little whisper in the ear, a little touch on the arm. ",
        "Josh: Hawk, come one. ",
        "Hawk: I'm talking to her, now! Let me tell\r\nyou something, missy. Reva has made her share of mistakes in this life, but she\r\nwould never-- never!-- Steal her sister's man. ",
        "Josh: Reva has slept with and married my\r\nfather and my brother. ",
        "Cassie: And I didn't steal anybody, Hawk. ",
        "Hawk: Reva has been nothing but good to you.\r\nShe welcomed you into her family with open arms, with an open heart. And this\r\nis how you repay her. ",
        "Josh: Come with me. You have to leave now. ",
        "Hawk: Be glad to. It stinks around here. ",
        "Josh: And while you're on your way out of\r\ntown, I suggest you call Reva and ask her what this marriage means to her. In\r\nfact, I can save you the quarter and I can tell you what it means to her. This\r\nmarriage means nothing. Nothing to her. But she's too much of a coward... ",
        "Hawk: Coward?! ",
        "Josh: Yes, a coward to end it like an adult.\r\nInstead she ran away with Billy, and this time I'm not running after her. ",
        "Hawk: I noticed. ",
        "Josh: Hey, I want a life, Hawk. All right? I\r\nwant a real life, not a drama, not some insanity with a woman who leaves every\r\ntime there's the first sign of emotional change in the weather. And that is not\r\nReva! I'm moving on. You don't like it, go to hell. ",
        "Hawk: Reckon I'll see you there. I'm just\r\nglad your mama isn't here to see this. God rest her soul. ",

        "Billy: Hey. Look, I want you just to lie\r\nvery still. I'm going to stand up, I'm going to get my phone out, I'm going to\r\nmake a phone call, okay? Good. ",
