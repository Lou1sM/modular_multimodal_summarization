You ready?", "Reva: Saying good-bye to my son? Sending him off to a place that's halfway across the world?", "Josh: I guess that would be \"no.\"", "Reva: Are you ready?", "Josh: I don't know that that matters. It's still good-bye. So, let's put on our game faces, shall we? Hey.", "Shayne: You know, the flight's not three weeks long, mom.", "Reva: Well, I know, but you never know what you're going to find over there, right? You know? I mean, how do you know whether you're going to be able to find a decent gummi bear in bosnia?", "Josh: (Laughs)", "Shayne: I'll manage, I will. I stopped by and said good-bye to sandy. I told him to make sure to cause a lot of trouble now that me and marah are both going to be gone.", "Josh: Thanks for thinking of us.", "Shayne: Mm-hmm. You're welcome.", "Reva: She'll be here. She's not going to let you leave without saying good- bye.", "Marina: Hey. I got here as quick as I could.", "Reva: I guess you got the same call we did.", "Marina: I just can't believe you're leaving right now.", "Shayne: I know. It was a lot quicker than i thought I would, too. You probably haven't even had time to think...", "Marina: No, no. I don't need to think about it. I already know. I want to be with you. So, yes. I'm going, too.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: Hey, bill. I am sick and tired of all your comments about michelle.", "Bill: Yeah, well, let me tell you something.", "Danny: Do you hear me?", "Bill: I'm sick of you ruining her life...", "Danny: Get over it.", "Olivia: Back off! Both of you! Back off! What's going on?", "Bill: It's about history, that's what it is, and I'm sick of it repeating itself. Yeah.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: Wow. (Laughs) that is a surprise, huh? It's nice. Nice, but definitely a surprise. Whoo! One way to seal that deal. Now, I'm thinking over here is going to be the private lounge for the club. Good idea, right? What do you think?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: Did you hear that? Good, bill's here. (Knocks on door)", "Jeffrey: Expecting someone?", "Dinah: Yeah, bill, the guy who lives here.", "Jeffrey: Well, bill would use his key.", "Dinah: No, not if his hands were full. He went to go get some food. Go out the back door.", "Cassie: What is going on in there?", "Cassie: I know I heard something in there.", "Edmund: Well, maybe he doesn't want any visitors. (Knocking on door)", "Cassie: Jeffrey.", "Jeffrey: You noticed.", "Cassie: Is bill here?", "Jeffrey: Uh, no. No, bill's not here.", "Cassie: He just left you in his apartment?", "Jeffrey: I know it's kind of hard to believe, isn't it?", "Edmund: You and bill have business together?", "Jeffrey: Yes, we do.", "Edmund: Would that be da business or federal agent business?", "Jeffrey: Well, you know what? It doesn't look like bill is going to show up here anytime soon, so I suggest we all go look for him somewhere else. Huh, what do you say? Shall we?", "Cassie: Okay, this is really random-- weird-- but I wanted to talk to you. I came here to talk to bill about upgrading the security system at the beacon.", "Jeffrey: That's a great idea. I want to talk about security, too.", "Edmund: Good. We all do.", "Jeffrey: Good. Let's go.", "Cassie: Okay.", "Jeffrey: All right. Coming?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Right behind you.", "Dinah: Edmund, it's dee.", "Edmund: Well, I was hoping you'd call.", "Dinah: We need to meet. Like now.", "Edmund: Yes, we do.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Well, danny boy here is not a very good history student, because he keeps making the same mistakes over and over again. And don't even get me started on michelle, who can't even remember the fact that she made a mistake to marry you in the first place.", "Danny: Still jealous, bill, after all this time.", "Bill: Yeah. Okay there, danny boy.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: What was that?", "Bill: Whatever.", "Frank: I can't believe that harley can even stand to be in the same room with that guy, let alone ask him to help with phillip.", "Buzz: Wasn't my idea. Well, if it isn't the bride of frankenstein.", "Olivia: Hey, he's not my husband anymore.", "Frank: Well, good. Then you won't get caught in the crossfire.", "Olivia: What crossfire? What are you talking about?", "Buzz: He's going to flatten this place like a pancake. He called up his pal, you know? He got his guys to exercise something called eminent domain.", "Bill: Wait a minute. Phillip wants to tear this place down? Why?", "Buzz: He said it was business. You know? But he'll build something in its place.", "Frank: Well, you know, that's just not going to happen because he's going to have to bulldoze over all the coopers first.", "Buzz: Gee, I hope it doesn't come to that.", "Frank: Let's go, pop.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: What is this going to... why is this property so valuable?", "Bill: It's a very good question. What's phillip up to?", "Olivia: I don't know, but we have to find out. We have to stop him. He's torn apart too many lives.", "Bill: Oh, please. You don't care about the restaurant or the coopers.", "Olivia: I like them! I don't care about them as much as you do, but I... it sounded good.", "Bill: Well, see, there's the girl I know. All revenge, all the time.", "Olivia: Well, that kind of thirst is going to get us what we want. So, come on. Let's go find a computer. Let's find out what's going on. Let's go to your place.", "Bill: Um, what about your place?", "Olivia: I'm living at the spaulding house. It's not smart to spy on the guy next door. What's wrong with your apartment?", "Bill: Uh, nothing, nothing. Just, uh, give me... give me a little time to clean up, okay?", "Olivia: Sure, yeah. Whatever.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tony: Michelle?", "Michelle: How hot is this? The club, I mean. (Laughs)", "Tony: Okay, listen.", "Michelle: All right, I may not have much of a memory, but i know that look. You want to talk about what just happened.", "Tony: It was... it... it was...", "Michelle: It was...?", "Tony: It was...", "Michelle: Keep going. It was a kiss. It was great. It was a great kiss, but look at me. I'm not melting or itching to run away with you. It's okay. I mean, how's your memory, because the last time I checked, I was married to your cousin. Right? Let's go up to the observation deck.", "Tony: What for?", "Michelle: Because I've got a million ideas I want to run by you about the restaurant I want to put up there. I mean, can you believe this light?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Shayne: I can't believe you're coming with me.", "Marina: Well, all that's left is my visa approval, and that should come through in a day or two. And then I can follow you and we can do this volunteer work together.", "Josh: Marina? Is your dad okay with this?", "Marina: Well, yeah. I mean, why wouldn't he be? What's more important than helping people, right?", "Shayne: Are you sure? I mean, I sprung this on you pretty quickly.", "Marina: I know. It was a big surprise, but...", "Reva: Now, you have thought about it and your family is okay with this, because it's a big decision. It's huge.", "Announcer: We will pre-board global airlines flight nine to paris shortly.", "Shayne: That's me.", "Marina: So you're going to visit marah first? Did you bring enough food? It's a long flight.", "Reva: Already took care of that. Mother's duty.", "Marina: Yeah. What about gum for when your ears pop?", "Shayne: I don't really need...", "Marina: I'll be right back.", "Shayne: No. Marina, wait. I don't need...", "Josh: (Laughs)", "Shayne: She always does that. Whenever something really big is going on, she needs to feel like she's helping.", "Reva: I know the feeling. I mean, you two have discussed this? You know what it means? I mean, does she really want to go with you?", "Shayne: We love each other, mom.", "Reva: No, I know that, sweetheart, I do. But... I don't want to put this the wrong way, but I just hope that marina didn't feel pressured to say yes.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Shayne: No, mom, all I did was tell her how much I wanted her to come with me. Why are you doing this right now?", "Frank: There he is! Hey, big man.", "Shayne: Oh, hey.", "Frank: What's up?", "Shayne: How's it going?", "Buzz: The backpack. Just the backpack. That's just... way to go. Where's marina?", "Josh: She'll be back in a second. Are you okay with this?", "Frank: What, me? I think this whole thing is incredible. I mean, it gives me hope for the future.", "Shayne: Thanks. See, mom? I told you everything would be cool with marina.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: I was just worried about her.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Buzz: That's why we're here. We knew how tough it would be for her to say good-bye to shayne.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Danny? Do you have any idea of the position you've put cassie in?", "Danny: I'm not in the mood, edmund.", "Edmund: The loans, danny. I'm talking about the government loans you asked cassie to cosign for you, the loans which you are not paying back in a timely fashion.", "Danny: I'm working on it, okay?", "Edmund: How? How, danny? Because cassie could lose everything she has, including her hotel.", "Danny: I understand that, and I'm working on it.", "Edmund: Turn it around, danny, and turn it around now, or believe me, I will. And I'm not going to wait much longer, and you won't like what I do. I won't have cassie end up the way michelle did: As your collateral damage. That I promise you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: Okay, if there is a better view anywhere in springfield than that observation deck, I've got to know about it.", "Tony: It's not bad.", "Michelle: Not bad? Hey! That could be a good name for this place. See, you're just, like, the inspiration.", "Tony: Hmm. No, I'm just the money guy.", "Michelle: No, no. You're more than that.", "Tony: Really?", "Michelle: Mm-hmm.", "Tony: Like what?", "Michelle: You're the muscle.", "Tony: (Laughs) oh, that's great.", "Michelle: I don't know. All right, you're the class.", "Tony: Yeah, me, the class. I'm all that.", "Michelle: You're... I just... I'm trying to say you have a lot more to offer, and I don't really know how to put it in words.", "Tony: Oh, michelle, come on. You were the one that... you gave me the idea, it sounded great. Looks... it's a good idea.", "Michelle: Good?", "Tony: Yeah.", "Michelle: It's phenomenal. I have so many ideas in my head, I can barely keep them there. And you know, there's a lot of extra room up there right now.", "Tony: You're insane, you know that?", "Michelle: Yeah, I know.", "Tony: You are.", "Michelle: It's a head injury, all right? So let's write all this down before we, you know, forget.", "Tony: There's a little too much of that lately, huh?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: Well, hey, kids.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Coming up on \"guiding light\"...", "Olivia: I don't care that you have a girlfriend.", "Bill: It's not my girlfriend, olivia. It'S...", "Olivia: What?", "Bill: It's, uh... it's my sister.", "Edmund: If I find out that you've held back this information from me, you may live, but only to regret it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: What's going on here, michelle? Is somebody living here?", "Michelle: No, I've been using it as a workspace, and I didn't think that you would mind.", "Rick: A workspace? For what?", "Michelle: All right, rick, what would you say if there was a place in springfield that you could go, get a drink, meet a friend, grab a meal?", "Rick: Well, let me think about that for a second.", "Michelle: This idea is genius, rick. I'm telling you, if I can say so myself. The view from here is, like...", "Rick: It's spectacular, michelle. I used to live here years ago, remember?", "Michelle: Well, then you know that what a waste of space it would be not to use this place for anything, right? So, what do you think if we turned it into a business? You know, like a club or a restaurant, whatever you want to call it.", "Rick: The lighthouse?", "Michelle: Yeah. I even came up with a name already. Listen to this: Light.", "Rick: Light.", "Michelle: Isn't that perfect?", "Rick: Light. Very original. Very postmodern.", "Michelle: I'm really, really psyched about this.", "Rick: I can see that. So, where does tony fit into this idea?", "Michelle: He's going to be my partner.", "Rick: What?", "Michelle: Tony is going to bankroll me. Danny and I are kind of in a money crunch right now and tony...", "Rick: Tony just sort of stepped in, how generous of him.", "Tony: I'm just a silent partner, rick. This is her baby all the way. All right, buddy. I am going to go. I will see you later.", "Michelle: No, no, stay. Hang out.", "Tony: No, no. I'll call you, okay? See you later, rick.", "Rick: See you. Can I just ask you a question?", "Michelle: Sure.", "Rick: Do you have a death wish?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dinah: I'm sorry I'm late.", "Edmund: I'm fed up with this game, dee-- or whatever your name is. As far as I'm concerned, our deal is off.", "Dinah: What game? I don't understand why you're talking to me like this.", "Edmund: When were you going to tell me?", "Dinah: Tell you what?", "Edmund: That jeffrey o'neill is no longer working as a federal agent? That he has, in fact, been on leave for these past two weeks, which means he's only hanging around springfield for personal reasons?", "Dinah: Where did you get that information?", "Edmund: It doesn't matter. Why didn't I hear it from you?", "Dinah: Because I had no idea that jeffrey is on his own time now.", "Edmund: No, of course, not.", "Dinah: Edmund, why would i lie to you?", "Edmund: Control? Perversity? Profit? All of the above?", "Dinah: Please.", "Edmund: I'm not a fool. You sought me out and filled me with innuendo about jeffrey o'neill, but when it comes to giving me cold, hard facts about the man, you don'T. Or won'T. Or both. It really doesn't much matter now. Don't ever call me again.", "Dinah: Hold it.", "Edmund: And no touching, remember?", "Dinah: If anything-- if anything-- this proves what I've been trying to tell you about jeffrey all along.", "Edmund: Really?", "Dinah: Yes, that you can never know what his next move is or let alone what his motives are. You can't trust anything he says or does.", "Edmund: I don'T. I'm simply adding you to the list.", "Dinah: I'm not interested in control, edmund, or money, or some perverted, kinky satisfaction. I want jeffrey. Why would I keep information from a manho can help me get him? If I did that, I'd be a fool, and nobody has accused me of that yet.", "Edmund: Which I find very surprising, considering your interest in jeffrey o'neill.", "Dinah: Well, what can I say? I have a thing for bad boys.", "Edmund: Dee? You have no idea what bad is. If I find out that you've held back this information from me, you may live, but only to regret it.", "Dinah: And you? Don't you think you would regret if you worry a little too much about little ol' me and not enough about what jeffrey is doing around cassie with all his free time? I think you need to think about that before you deep-six our deal. Good-bye.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Dinah? It's me. Listen, I didn't pick up the food. We've got a little change of plans. Got ourselves a situation. Got someone coming over.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, a security upgrade like that could only make the place safer, it's true. But...", "Cassie: Wait a minute. I was hoping that you would tell me it would make it totally safe.", "Jeffrey: Ah.", "Rj: Mommy!", "Cassie: Hey!", "Rj: Hi.", "Cassie: Look at this hat!", "Jeffrey: Hey, we've got child labor laws in this country, mrs. Winslow.", "Bellhop: There you are.", "Cassie: Hey. He's not bothering you, is he, oliver?", "Bellhop: Not at all. He's been a big help.", "Cassie: Well, in that case, he needs to move up to steamer trunks.", "Bellhop: You ready to get back to work?", "Rj: Bags, bags, bags.", "Bellhop: Come on.", "Cassie: See, that's why i want to hear that my hotel is 100% safe. Better yet, I'd love to hear that this whole identity theft thing was just one big mistake and these people aren't really dangerous. I'd love to hear that my little boys can be that adorable and i don't have to worry about them for one second, jeffrey.", "Jeffrey: I wish I could tell you that.", "Cassie: Wrong answer. (Sighs)", "Jeffrey: Cassie...", "Cassie: No, you have to tell me something. You've got to give me something. Something, some way I can protect myself and my boys. I mean, you have to know something. How do these people think? I mean, you've had to have some kind of contact with them.", "Jeffrey: Well, the truth is, it's hard to explain what makes anyone tick. But I'M... I'm going to take care of you, okay? You and your family. I promise.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marina: I know you already said you had a lot of food, but I got you some sandwiches and fruit.", "Frank: Hey, baby.", "Marina: Hey, dad.", "Frank: We... your grandfather and I, we thought you could use some backup, so...", "Marina: Thanks.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Shayne: Can we talk for a second?", "Marina: Yeah.", "Shayne: What are you doing?", "Marina: What? If you don't want the sandwiches, I can go get you a salad instead.", "Shayne: They don't know? I mean, you didn't tell your dad that you're coming with me?", "Marina: There just wasn't a good time. I figured I'd tell him later. I thought if things settled down at company...", "Shayne: What's wrong at company?", "Marina: Phillip spaulding is trying to knock it down, but it's okay. My dad will understand I have to go with you.", "Shayne: Your family's place? Why?", "Marina: What do you mean, why? I love you. And you asked me to go.", "Shayne: Yeah. That was before I knew that they were trying to knock down company.", "Marina: It was before I knew, too. But it'll be okay. My dad is here, and harley. They'll help grandpa, who is not exactly a wimp himself, by the way. They don't need me.", "Shayne: Baby, you need to ask yourself what's right for you.", "Marina: I want to go.", "Shayne: Yeah, you want to go, but is it right? If I had known what was going on at company, I never would have... I probably never would have asked you to come with me anyway.", "Marina: I love you.", "Shayne: I love you, too.", "Marina: And you always say, love is the only thing that matters, right?", "Shayne: All of a sudden, I'm not so sure. I'm going away because I have to. I have to make a difference. I've always felt like that my whole life, and it's just now is the first time I'm taking that step. I need to do it. Is that why you're doing it? Is that what you're doing? Or is that what you want?", "Marina: Whoa, what? Is this trip, like, my passion or something? No. You are.", "Shayne: Really? Or are you maybe just afraid to let us go?", "Marina: That's a really crummy thing to say.", "Shayne: Then tell me it's not true.", "Marina: Shayne, don't you... (sobs) don't you want me there with you?", "Shayne: I want you there more than you can imagine. You have to figure out what's right for you, where you need to be. I can't think for you. I mean, how do you feel deep inside? Just listen to that, because if you listen back, if you listen to that then you'll be doing it for all the right reasons, whatever you do.", "Marina: I'm going to miss you so much.", "Shayne: It's going to be okay. You know it's going to be okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Frank: Uh, I got the feeling we just walked into something pretty big here.", "Josh: Yeah, we all did.", "Frank: Okay, will somebody clue me in as to what's going on here?", "Josh: Later.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Announcer: Global airlines flight nine to paris is now boarding.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marina: I put extra mayo on the sandwiches, just like you like it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Shayne: Thanks. I guess this is it.", "Frank: Um, shayne? Best of luck to you, my friend.", "Shayne: Thanks. Take care of marina.", "Buzz: Oh, it will probably be the other way around. (Laughs)", "Frank: You have a good safe flight, man.", "Shayne: I will.", "Buzz: You're a terrific young man. You've got class.", "Shayne: Thanks.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Josh: Get out of here. Come here. (Laughs) it seems like every couple of months I'm telling you I've never been more proud of you than I am at this moment. And the thing is, every single time, it's been true. Especially now. Do good things, son. It's in you.", "Shayne: I love you, dad.", "Josh: I love you, too, son. There you go.", "Shayne: Thanks.", "Reva: Don't say anything or I'm going to fall apart. My sweet, beautiful child. I love you. I love you so much and I always will.", "Announcer: This is the final boarding call for global flight nine.", "Reva: Go.", "Shayne: Thank you.", "Josh: For what?", "Shayne: For always pointing me in the right direction and then letting me choose to go that way. Bye.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marina: Bye. (Sobs)", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: Vroom, vroom, vroom. Look, rick, I know the idea, you know, to open a restaurant seems kind of nutty, but, you know, sometimes the nutty ideas are the ones that work.", "Rick: Michelle, I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about your choice of a partner, the one that you're ignoring your son for.", "Michelle: I'm not ignoring my son.", "Rick: Michelle, I was at the playground today right outside the beacon with robbie. You pulled into the parking lot downstairs, and I asked robbie if he ever had spent any time here at the lighthouse, and he said, \"never.\" It just sort of surprised me, since you virtually spend all of your time here.", "Michelle: Rick, I needed this as a place to get away, all right? You can relax. It's not like it's a secret hideout.", "Rick: Well, certainly not for tony.", "Michelle: He's my partner, period.", "Rick: Michelle, I'm just going to lay this out for you, okay? Danny has a tendency not to be a very nice guy sometimes.", "Michelle: Well, he's always been nice to me, so...", "Rick: Well, there's a lot about danny you don't remember, michelle, and I do, okay? If you like tony, or if you even care about him as a human being, you won't put him in this position.", "Michelle: What? Danny loves me so much he's going to fly into a murderous rage?", "Rick: He could do that, yes.", "Michelle: I don't really see that.", "Rick: Michelle, there's a lot you don't see right now. Robbie? You take care. I had such a good time with you today. We'll do it again real soon, okay?", "Michelle: Rick, it's not what you're thinking.", "Rick: It doesn't matter what I think, does it?", "Michelle: (Sighs) we're going to go for a ride. Come on.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: Hey. I thought you said there was something that you had to do.", "Edmund: I did. It just went more quickly than i expected. And there's something else i have to do, if you'll excuse me.", "Cassie: Of course.", "Jeffrey: The ambassador seems to be a little edgy today.", "Cassie: Yeah, well, he's got company.", "Bellhop: Mrs. Winslow, there's a phone call for you.", "Cassie: Okay, thank you.", "Jeffrey: Go ahead. I've got some work I've got to do, also. Okay?", "Cassie: Okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dinah: I have to disappear.", "Bill: I mean, today, that was a close call, but next time, who knows, you know?", "Dinah: I know.", "Bill: Listen, I'm going to miss you, but I really do, i think you're safer if you leave.", "Dinah: Hey, look, you're right. You're right. You are very smart, you're very grown-up, and you're my hero. (Knock at door)", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Hi.", "Olivia: Clean yet?", "Bill: What?", "Olivia: Your apartment. Looks pretty neat to me.", "Bill: Um, yeah. Uh, come on in, um...", "Olivia: So, who is she?", "Bill: What?", "Olivia: The woman you're expecting.", "Bill: What are you talking about? There's no other woman. You're way off base.", "Olivia: Am I?", "Bill: Yeah. What? There's no other woman. I mean, why would I keep it from you? I mean, it's not like I need to hide anything from you. We're associates, that's all.", "Olivia: Yeah. Well, no, I just thought maybe you were trying to protect my feelings.", "Bill: You mean, like, you have feelings other than the lust for revenge, hmm?", "Olivia: You might be surprised.", "Bill: Yeah. Look, you're here to talk about phillip. Why don't we just do that, huh?", "Olivia: Okay. I'd love some wine first.", "Bill: Wine? Yeah. Yeah, sure.", "Olivia: So this woman that doesn't exist? Her name dinah?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: So if you could give me a call back at your earliest convenience, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks.", "Michelle: Oh, good, I caught you. Look who's here.", "Danny: Yeah, you found me. Hey, buddy! What's going on? Hi. How was the park?", "Michelle: I've got something I want to talk to you about.", "Danny: Did you have a good time with uncle rick? If it's about that job that tony offered me, I don't want to discuss it. You understand?", "Michelle: No, it's not about that. I have some news for you.", "Danny: About what?", "Michelle: Well, I know money is not exactly a good subject for us right now, and I know that you think that there's nothing I can do to help us out.", "Danny: What? I didn't say that.", "Michelle: Yeah, you did. You said that earlier at the beacon, and you were wrong. Danny, I am going to open a restaurant and club that's going to make us back all the money we need to pay off our debt.", "Danny: A restaurant and club?", "Michelle: Yeah. In the lighthouse. And it's going to be incredible. A different feel on every level, amazing music and food and views.", "Danny: Are you serious?", "Michelle: Oh, yeah. I even came up with a name already-- light.", "Danny: Look, I... i appreciate what you're trying to do, I do. But, honey, you don't just decide to open a restaurant and magically it happens. You need capital, a lot of capital, which is exactly what i don't have right now.", "Michelle: I know. Which is why I went out and got a backer. Tony.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: I keep thinking he's going to come back out that door.", "Marina: No. He's gone. (Sobbing) dad, could we just...", "Frank: Yeah, baby. Sure, of course. I'm going to take marina home, so we'll see you guys later.", "Buzz: He's a great kid.", "Marina: I miss him already.", "Reva: Sweetie, we do, too.", "Marina: See you later.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: He's right, you know. Shayne is a wonderful kid.", "Josh: It's our fault. We raised him well. And marah.", "Reva: How did we manage to do that?", "Josh: \"Do as I say, not as i do.\"", "Reva: Oh, no, no, no, no. Because we were never content just to watch life go by from the sidelines, you know? We had to jump in with both feet and marah and shayne learned that from us, from the beginning.", "Josh: Is that a good thing?", "Reva: It's a very good thing.", "Josh: You know, it's strange. If they learned from our example, why is it that I'm so much more proud of them than I've ever been of myself?", "Reva: Because you're such a humble guy.", "Josh: Oh, yes. That's right, I forgot. No, I'm lucky. I just have so much more than i ever deserved.", "Reva: Don't you think you deserve me?", "Josh: (Laughs) now, that's not luck, that's a blessing. (Sighs) we did okay, reva shayne.", "Reva: Let's go home, bud.", "Josh: Okay. (Knock at door)", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tony: Michelle? Michelle, I forgot my... my phone.", "Michelle: Thank you. Thank you.", "Tony: Michelle? Michelle, danny... danny won'T...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: Forget danny. Forget him.", "Danny: Oh, michelle, it's a lot to think about-- a club, a restaurant.", "Michelle: Tony. Look, I know you don't want to take that job from tony because his money is not necessarily clean, but I told you, that's not really an issue for me.", "Danny: Michelle...", "Michelle: Only because we're in so much trouble, you know? And it's a great idea. We need the money.", "Danny: So take it.", "Michelle: What?", "Danny: Take it. I mean, obviously I can't tell you what you should or should not do, so if you don't have a problem taking money from tony, I'm not going to stop you. It's your business, your deal.", "Michelle: You mean that?", "Danny: Mm-hmm. You're trying to help us out.", "Michelle: I am. I'm trying to do what's best for us, for our family.", "Danny: And when it comes to family, you've got to do what you have to. So, go ahead. Michelle, do what you have to. And I'll do the same.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: I don't care that you have a girlfriend.", "Bill: It's not my girlfriend, olivia. It'S...", "Olivia: What?", "Bill: It'S... it's my sister.", "Olivia: Dinah? She'S... she's here in springfield? I thought... I thought that she was...", "Bill: Yeah, a fugitive. Wanted for murder, hiding out in europe. I know.", "Olivia: Well, what is she doing here? Does cassie know?", "Bill: No, cassie doesn't know. No one knows. And no one can know, okay?", "Olivia: What?!", "Bill: Listen to me. She's not a threat to anyone, believe me. But just promise me that you're not going to tell anyone that she's here.", "Olivia: Okay. Okay. Well, you know, if we're going to play catch-up with phillip, we're going to have to get to work, all right?", "Bill: Yeah, yeah. I guess.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: Edmund. Now, how did you get in here?", "Edmund: A hotel lock is not much of an obstacle.", "Jeffrey: Hmm. What do you want?", "Edmund: To discuss the level of concern you're showing cassie.", "Jeffrey: \"Level of concern.\"", "Edmund: I think you know exactly what I'm talking about.", "Jeffrey: Well, you know, cassie is in a dicey situation right now, edmund. I'm just trying to help.", "Edmund: Yes, of course you are. Mr. O'neill?", "Jeffrey: Hmm?", "Edmund: Everyone in this town thinks I'm a changed man, that I've somehow transformed myself from monster to model citizen. But I'll let you in on a little secret.", "Jeffrey: Oh, please do.", "Edmund: I'm not so much transformed. In fact, I'm exactly what I used to be. And I'm waiting, mr. O'neill. I'm waiting for someone to push me just far enough to the point where everyone is reminded of why they were frightened of me in the first place. Good night, mr. O'neill.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: Okay, thanks. Bye. Oliver, where's rj?", "Bellhop: Oh, he's helping me take some bags out. Don't worry. I've got my eye on him.", "Cassie: Okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dinah: Hey, buddy. How you doing? (Laughs) you working hard?", "Rj: Do you have any bags?", "Dinah: Oh, I wish I did. But you know what? You can help me another time. I was going to go far, far away, but I'm not going to. I'm going to stay right here. Isn't that a good idea?", "Rj: Yeah.", "Dinah: Yeah.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Josh: Next, on \"guiding light\"...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sandy: What can you really say about me?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: Well, what I don't know about you, I just don't know about you yet."], "Transcript Author": ["By Boo"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5GGBPAxRKc"}
