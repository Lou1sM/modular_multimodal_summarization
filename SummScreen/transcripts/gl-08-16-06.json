        "Coop: For most, it was just an ordinary summer night. Fireflies dancing, the \r\nair thick with heat. But for Ava and me, tonight would be anything but ordinary. \r\nCall it love, call it lust, call it about damn time, but we had big plans. Then \r\nagain, I wasn't the only Cooper with big plans. ",
        "Frank: All right. ",
        "Marina: Come here. ",
        "Frank: Ah! Ah! Ah! Is that... is that necessary? ",
        "Harley and Marina: Yes. ",
        "Coop: My brother, Frank, is a decorated officer, the chief of police, in \r\nfact, but in our family, he's still Frank, the resident good guy in need of a \r\ngood girl. ",
        "Frank: Oh, my gosh. ",
        "Harley: So you have absolutely no idea what this girl looks like? ",
        "Frank: No, sis, it's a blind date. ",
        "Marina: But you talked to her on the phone, right? I mean, what does it sound \r\nlike she looks like? ",
        "Frank: What? ",
        "Harley: Her voice! Is she like Kathleen Turner or one of the Olsen twins? ",
        "Frank: I don't know. ",
        "Harley: Whatever. Just don't, don't discuss politics. ",
        "Marina: And weather. Do not talk about the weather. ",
        "Harley: Or religion... ",
        "Marina: Or sports... ",
        "Frank: Sports? Oh, now you're drawing the line. Come on! Now look, I'm \r\nteasing you. But, you know what? You guys are treating me like I've never been \r\nout with a lady before. Come on. ",
        "Marina: And do not call her a lady. It sounds old. ",
        "Frank: Okay, fine. Then what do I talk about? ",
        "Marina: Her. ",
        "Harley: Her. Let her know how intriguing and fascinating you find her. ",
        "Marina: Yes, and then she'll be like, \"Oh, wow, this is totally one \r\nthoughtful and caring guy.\" And then that's when she'll ask more about you. ",
        "Harley: Mhmm. And don't screw that up. ",
        "Frank: What does that mean? ",
        "Harley: Don't talk shop. ",
        "Marina: You better take his badge away. He's a flasher. ",
        "Frank: Oh, no. ",
        "Harley: Give me. ",
        "Frank: No, no, no. Absolutely not. No, no, it's my badge. ",
        "Harley: Just give it to me. ",
        "Frank: No, no, you don't-- oh! ",
        "Harley: Thanks. Okay, come on. Come on. ",
        "Frank: Come on you guys. Okay, you know what this means? This means I'm going \r\nto have to put on my special moves for her. ",
        "Harley: What a threat. ",
        "Marina: Oh, give her it. ",
        "Harley: No, no, no. Oh, come on. You're going to be late, you're going to be \r\nlate. You have to go. ",
        "Marina: So, where are you taking her? ",
        "Frank: What? Come on, pizza and a movie. ",
        "Marina: Oh! Dad! How are you supposed to get to know her? You can't talk \r\nduring a movie. ",
        "Harley: And I've seen you eat pizza. ",
        "Frank: Okay. You have a better idea? ",
        "Harley: You think? ",
        "Marina: He needs it. ",
        "Harley: Okay, come on. Quick, quick. Take off your shirt. ",
        "Frank: What now? ",
        "Harley: Just take off your shirt. ",
        "Frank: My shirt? What are you going to do now? ",
        "Coop: Frank had no idea what he was getting into. ",
        "Harley: All right. You ready? ",
        "Frank: What are you two... ? ",
        "",
        "Coop: And, as it turned out, neither did our father. ",
        "Buzz: Why? Why do I have to wear this? ",
        "Olivia: Because you look good in it. You do, and I have the finishing touch.\r\n",
        "Buzz: Oh, no. No, no, no. No hats. ",
        "Olivia: It's a toque blanche. ",
        "Buzz: It's a French name... that's a stupid white hat. ",
        "Olivia: It goes to a good cause. ",
        "Buzz: Aw, come on. ",
        "Olivia: Proceeds go to the restoration of the Beacon. Look, it's a local \r\nlandmark, it's my bread and butter and half the town lives there, so there you \r\ngo... ",
        "Buzz: Okay. Look, I'm doing it for you. But good luck with the competition. \r\nThey're not going to wear any stupid hats. ",
        "Olivia: Well... ",
        "Buzz: They're local chefs, there not gonna touch this.",
        "Olivia: It\u2019s not exactly a local chef, but\u2026",
        "Petrovsky: Buzz Cooper?",
        "Buzz: Yeah I\u2019m Buzz Cooper, you are\u2026 are\u2026",
        "Petrovsky: Yes, I am. Here, in the flesh, in your very small town. May the \r\nbest chef win, eh? ",
        "Buzz: I'm competing against a celebrity. He's a celebrity chef! He's a \r\nseven-foot-tall celebrity chef. With a big knife. ",
        "",
        "Harley: Hello? A little help, please. ",
        "Marina: Yeah, I think he's going to be okay as long as he just pays atten...\r\n",
        "Harley: Marina! ",
        "Marina: What? ",
        "Harley: Could you help out a sister here and... ",
        "Marina: What? ",
        "Harley: Get me a tampon. ",
        "Marina: Oh. I was wondering what was taking you so long. You use the x-large \r\njumbo kind, right? ",
        "Harley: Shut up! Thank you. ",
        "Marina: Uh-huh. You know, what would this family do without me? ",
        "Harley: I hope we never have to find that out. ",
        "Marina: Handling those Cooper men is like a full-time, two- woman job. They \r\ncan hardly tie their own shoes. ",
        "Harley: You're not just figuring that out, are you? ",
        "Marina: Well, what did you do in these moments of womanly crisis before I was \r\naround? ",
        "Harley: You should feel sorry for your father. You have absolutely no idea \r\nwhat it was like for him raising a little girl. ",
        "Maria: Yeah, well, you know, at least now he has you and, well, both of us to \r\nwatch his back. ",
        "Harley: Hmm. Well, pretty quiet in here. Not much going on tonight. ",
        "",
        "Ashlee: Coming through! Hi, yeah, just give me one second, I'm alone here. \r\nAnd for the last time, there's no spinach pie-- tonight, or ever. Thank you. Hi, \r\nyeah, this way. ",
        "Coop: At least my night was going according to plan. Ava and I, in a rare \r\nstroke of luck, had managed to get the same night off. Ashlee was new to the \r\njob, but eager to prove herself. And Wednesdays were always slow, anyway. ",
        "Ava: Hey, there. What? ",
        "Coop: What do you mean, \"What\"? Look at you, you look beautiful. ",
        "Ava: Thank you. I can't believe tonight is finally happening. ",
        "Coop: I know, I know. And guess what? I've already made reservations at that \r\nrestaurant on the lake. ",
        "Ava: Oh, good. I wanted to try that place. And then what? ",
        "Coop: And then what? Are you kidding me? We're already checked in. ",
        "Ava: Oh, great. Thanks. It's kind of busy tonight, right? It's a little \r\nweird. ",
        "Coop: Yeah, weird. So, you ready? ( Loud crash ) ",
        "Ashlee: I'll nuke them in a minute, lady. I'm all alone here. ",
        "Coop: We were this close. I had hoped for a memorable night. Maybe I should \r\nhave been more specific. ",
        "Ashlee: Coop. ",
        "Coop: Yeah? What do we got, Ashlee? ",
        "Ashlee: The register is jammed. ",
        "Coop: Yeah, don't worry about it, it does it all the time. There you go. \r\nVoila. Don't worry about it, you'll get the hang of this, okay? ",
        "Ashlee: Okay. ",
        "Coop: Well, there goes our wonderful evening. ",
        "Ava: Well, the night's not over yet. ",
        "Coop: You know what, you're taking this a lot better than I am, I'll tell you \r\nthat. ",
        "Ava: My new dress has put me in a really good mood. ",
        "Coop: Yeah, well, your new dress has put me in a good mood, too, I'll tell \r\nyou that. Come here. ",
        "Ashlee: Okay, coming through. Sorry. Sorry, sorry. Oh, God! ",
        "Ava: Wait, wait, wait. ",
        "Ashlee: No, it's okay. It's like I have vertigo or something. ",
        "Ava: It's nerves. It's just nerves. ",
        "Ashlee: I swear when things slow down, you guys can go on your date, and, you \r\nknow, I really have things under control. ",
        "Ava: It's fine. ",
        "Coop: It's okay, I understand. ",
        "Ashlee: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I am so sorry. I am so sorry. Here, I have \r\nwater. I'm sorry, it's just, it's just who orders guacamole with French fries?\r\n",
        "Ava: You know what? Guacamole's actually really good for the hair. ",
        "Ashlee: Oh, God, I'm sorry. I thought that was mayonnaise? ",
        "Ava: No, it's, you know, guacamole's great for the hair. You should see what \r\nthey're charging at the salons. Oh, boy. Okay. All right. ",
        "",
        "Coop: I thought Ava made a great save. Unfortunately, the customer did not. \r\nStill, a little guacamole wouldn't keep us from our romantic night. But \r\nsomething else was about to. At least Frank was having better luck in the \r\nromance department, and that's not something we get to say often around here.\r\n",
        "Frank: You probably think I'm nuts bringing you up here, huh? ",
        "Teresa: I think it's great. I was expecting the standard first date movie.\r\n",
        "Frank: ( Laughs ) Well, you know, you really can't talk in a movie. ",
        "Teresa: Exactly! You're like the first guy I've ever met that gets that. ",
        "Frank: Well, then, you know what, Teresa? I honestly believe that you've been \r\nhanging out with the wrong kind of guys. ",
        "Teresa: It sounds like it. So, what made you pick the roof? ",
        "Frank: Let's just say the idea kind of came to me. ",
        "Coop: Actually, all of Frank's ideas were just coming to him... from \r\nsomewhere else. ",
        "Harley: I told him to go with the wine. ",
        "Marina: How do you know he didn't? ",
        "Harley: That was the clink of champagne flutes. Wine glasses sound different.\r\n",
        "Marina: You are good. ",
        "Harley: Mm. Been doing this a long time. Frank? Champagne is overkill. I bet \r\nyou bought two bottles, too. Over the top! ",
        "Frank: What do you mean over the top? ",
        "Teresa: What? ",
        "Frank: Uh, the view. The view from here is over top of the town. ",
        "Harley: Nice save. And makes sure she sees the west view. ",
        "Frank: Have you seen the restroom? ",
        "Teresa: Oh, I don't have to go. ",
        "Frank: Oh. ",
        "Marina: Dad! The west view. ( Laughs ) ",
        "Frank: Oh, well that's good because I wanted to show you the view from the \r\nwest side. Look at that summer moon. ",
        "Teresa: It's beautiful. ",
        "Harley: And now you say something back. ",
        "Frank: You know, I love coming up here because it helps me take my mind off \r\nthe little annoying distractions down there. ",
        "Marina: So ungrateful. ",
        "Harley: Totally! ",
        "Teresa: Annoying distractions? You wouldn't happen to be talking about the \r\n\"Springfield Burns\" web site, would you? ",
        "Harley: Whoa, where did that come from? ",
        "Frank: You know what? I'm really not into gossip. ",
        "Teresa: Oh, no, no, neither am I, I mean, but I'm just a little curious. I \r\nmean, I think I read something about the chief of police and his father \r\ncompeting for the same woman. ",
        "Harley: Deny it. ",
        "Marina: No, don't lie. ",
        "Teresa: Look, Frank, I just want to make sure you're not already taken. What \r\nwas her name? Olivia? ",
        "Marina: Quick, change the subject. ",
        "Harley: Politics! ",
        "Marina: Sports! ",
        "Harley: Weather! ",
        "Frank: What? ",
        "",
        "Coop: If my night had hit a speed bump, my brother's had hit an iceberg. But, \r\nat least there was hope for dad. ",
        "TV host: All right, folks, settle in. Listen, about 30 seconds from now we're \r\ngoing to be on the air. We need lots of enthusiasm, lots of energy. Be loud, all \r\nright? Let's try it. Here we go. (Cheers and applause ) ",
        "Olivia: Keep your eye on the prize. You keep your eye on the prize, okay? I \r\nhave faith in you. ",
        "Buzz: I'm going to throw up. ",
        "Olivia: Oh. ",
        "TV host: Hey, everybody! I'm Hal Candig and it is time to play \"Food Fight\"! \r\nIt's going to be a great day. Here's the scoop: We have two chefs, 30 minutes, \r\nsame ingredients. Who is going to come out on top with the great dish? Oh, boy, \r\nwe've got some competition. We have Michel Petrovsky - he is the Apollo Creed, \r\nthe undisputed champion! You bet, it should be just terrific. And right here, \r\nBuzz Cooper's along with us. How about a hand for Buzz Cooper? (Crowd cheers )\r\n",
        "TV host: Buzz, I guess we can say, is the rocky of the range, so we're almost \r\nset to get started. Here we go! ( Crowd cheers ) ",
        "Buzz: He is a member of the French Culinary Institute. ",
        "Olivia: So what? ",
        "Buzz: You know, he's had his own TV shows? Do you know how many restaurants \r\nhe's opened? ",
        "Olivia: You're a franchise, too. ",
        "Buzz: The man has won an Emmy. ",
        "Olivia: Oh, well done. ",
        "Buzz: You could have told me a little sooner that I was competing against the \r\nheavyweight champion of the world. ",
        "Olivia: Didn't Apollo Creed die at the end of \"Rocky III?\" ",
        "Buzz: Yeah, but Rocky didn't kill him. ",
        "Olivia: Well... ",
        "Buzz: And it was number four. ",
        "Olivia: Okay, then this is your \"Rocky IV.\" Petrovsky's going down! Look, I \r\nbelieve in you. Plus, you're the local favorite. This whole town is in your \r\ncorner. Right? ( Cheers ) ",
        "Olivia: I think you're incredible and not just in the kitchen. ",
        "Petrovsky: Hey, is not fair. Where is good luck kiss for me, eh? ( Laughs )\r\n",
        "TV host: All right, let's meet our chefs right now and see what they're \r\nmaking today. Howdy, folks. We wish you the best of luck and listen, don't \r\nforget today's competition is a benefit for the Beacon Hotel restoration. So, \r\nfolks, how about we put down our weapons, if you will, shake hands? Are we ready \r\nto cook? Let's have a food fight! Take it away! ( Crowd cheers ) (frantic music \r\n) ",
        "",
        "Coop: What will a man do for love? Or, should I say, what won't he do. My \r\nfather was willing to go 15 rounds with the king of the kitchen. My brother was \r\nwilling to wear a wire to woo a woman. And me? I was willing to face every \r\nCooper's worst nightmare. Even on a hot summer night. He wore his signature \r\nblack trench coat. A man whose very presence struck fear into the heart of every \r\nrestauranteur across the county. ",
        "Inspector: Rob cook, Health Inspector. Who's in charge? ",
        "Coop: I am. Henry Cooper Bradshaw. ",

        "Inspector: Surprise. ",
        "Ashlee: I'm sorry, sir. It's all my fault. You see, I have vertigo and I \r\nspilled these drinks, and I spilled guaca... ",
        "Coop: Ashlee, it's okay. Just let us know if there's anything you need, Rob.\r\n",
        "Inspector: Call me Mr. Cook. ",
        "Ava: Okay, this is really bad considering the rush we just had and... ",
        "Coop: Look, Ava. Ava, it's okay. All right? This nice guy is trying to do his \r\njob, so I think we owe it to him and to the health department to let them do \r\ntheir job and make it easier. ",
        "Ava: Okay. What's wrong with you? ",
        "Coop: Ladies and gentlemen, can I please have your attention? I regret to \r\ninform you that Company will be closing to accommodate a pop quiz from the \r\nhealth department. Those are the nice folks that have made Company the excellent \r\ntrack-record-running restaurant that it is. So, I apologize for the \r\ninconvenience and we'll be taking care of you guys. ",

        "Frank: You know what? I really don't like talking about ex-girlfriends, I \r\nhave to admit. ",
