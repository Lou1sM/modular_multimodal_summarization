        "Marina: Are you getting a shot of how handsome this guy looks today?",
        "Danny: No, no, no. Put it on her...",
        "Marina: No, come.",
        "Danny: ...And how beautiful she looks.",
        "Buzz: I got you both in focus.",
        "Marina: So, what are you going to title this video?",
        "Buzz: \"The day when nothing better go wrong.\"",
        "Marina: Nothing is going to go wrong. Today is going to be a perfect day, and Harley is going to be a beautiful bride.",
        "Buzz: So will you, my dear.",
        "Marina: Get lost.",
        "Buzz: Okay.",
        "Marina: ( Sighs ) Hey, why don't you go stalk Dad. I'm sorry if what my grandpa just said makes you feel uncomfortable.",
        "Danny: What? No. No. No.",
        "Marina: Something wrong?",
        "Danny: No, no. Nothing's wrong. But there is something that you should know, though: Michelle came back from Africa. I ran into her.",
        "Marina: Oh. Well, how did she look?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Hey. Sorry I'm late.",
        "Bill: Hey. About eight months late. ( Chuckles )",
        "Michelle: I mean the other kind of late.",
        "Bill: Yeah, me, too. I didn't recognize you there for a second. That's really deep undercover. Michelle, Danny is the one who should be here with you today.",
        "Michelle: I'm not ready, Bill.",
        "Bill: I can't believe you had a conversation with him; he didn't know this?",
        "Michelle: I'm a little camouflaged.",
        "Bill: Are you going to tell him, because I think...?",
        "Michelle: I was going to, I was going to, but just...the timing wasn't exactly right. Until the baby is born and I can get a paternity test, I just have to do this on my own. On my own, with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Let's make this brief, shall we, Mr. Russo?",
        "Russo: Of course. Hello. Here you go. This is your divorce agreement from Cassie with that extra clause you asked me to insert. And this is our agreement for services rendered for finding you a baby.",
        "Edmund: Have you found one?",
        "Russo: Well, I've got some leads, but I can't guarantee you a baby on such short notice.",
        "Edmund: I have faith in you, Mr. Russo.",
        "Russo: I'm flattered. I'll be in touch.",
        "Edmund: Thank you.",
        "Dinah: Hey, you. The Coopers did a very good job of decorating this place, I have to admit, but when I get married it will not be in be in the back of a restaurant, or a barn. What's that?",
        "Edmund: Dinah, what are you doing up and about? We've already told Cassie the doctor put you on bed rest.",
        "Dinah: Yes, well, I was going a little crazy. There are only so many magazines a girl can read.",
        "Edmund: Still fatigued? Did you have the vitamin drink I left for you?",
        "Dinah: Yes. I drank every drop of that. Why don't you tell me what's in the envelopes?",
        "Edmund: Oh, these? These. Just copies of the divorce agreement for me and Cassie.",
        "Dinah: Good. Finally. Is there something in there about the settlement? About the farm?",

        "Alan: It's me.",
        "Russo: What is it, Alan?",
        "Alan: I haven't received any other information from Phillip since the note. Were you able to plant that gossip about me and Beth being together?",
        "Russo: I've been a little busy. I'll get to it.",
        "Alan: Make it a priority. I want it in the late edition.",
        "Russo: You're starting to scare me, Alan. I'm starting to think maybe you're a little bit off of your...",
        "Alan: Look, I don't care if you think I'm off my rocker. I'm paying you good money and I want you to help me lure my son out of hiding.",
        "Beth: Hello, Alan.",
        "Alan: Well, Beth. Finally a friendly face.",
        "Beth: Are they treating you okay here?",
        "Alan: Well, it's much better than prison, yes. How are you?",
        "Beth: I'm fine. Everyone's fine.",
        "Alan: Well, that's good to hear.",
        "Beth: Let's get right to the point. I assume you know why I'm here?",
        "Alan: My proposal?",
        "Beth: Was that just a whim or did you really mean it?",
        "Alan: I mean every word. And to prove it, I got you this.",

        "Blake: Okay, so who is coming to do your makeup?",
        "Harley: Oh, nobody. I already did it myself.",
        "Blake: You did?",
        "Harley: What, you don't like it?",
        "Blake: A little, uh, understated?",
        "Harley: Well, then it's perfect because that's what I want: A simple, fun, low-key wedding with understated hair and makeup. Which means--while you guys are my best friends and I love you--I really don't need three people to help me get dressed. So you go on.",
        "Blake: Shut up.",
        "Harley: No, I'm serious.",
        "Cassie: All of us?",
        "Harley: Go help my dad and Frank. Go, go. ( Knocking at door ) If that's Gus, please don't let him in, because I've had so much bad luck and I don't want to push my luck this year.",
        "Blake: Okay, fine.",
        "Mel: It's Jeffrey.",
        "Harley: Thank you.",
        "Jeffrey: Hi.",

        "Jeffrey: Yes. \"No men allowed, except for those willing to perform menial tasks.\"",
        "Mel: You got it. ( Laughter )",
        "Jeffrey: Do you still need me to play chauffeur?",
        "Cassie: No. Buzz wants to do it.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh. Okay.",
        "Blake: Thank you for the offer. You have him very well-trained. ( Laughter )",
        "Jeffrey: Yes. I sit and heel, too. ( Laughter )",
        "Cassie: Are you sure you don't want one of us to stay along with you?",
        "Harley: No, no. I'm serious. You guys go on. Go to Company. Just send my father back here at the appointed hour to pick me up and bring me over. I'll be fine.",
        "Blake: Are you s...",
        "Harley: I'll be fine. I love you guys. Go. We're all going to the same wedding, we'll see each other.",
        "Blake: Lips.",
        "Harley: You can do my makeup later. Okay? Promise. I'll let you do lips. Bye! It's been a year. Finally, one horrible year later. ( Knocking on door )",
        "Gus: Hi.",
        "Harley: ( Wails ) No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. You can't come in here. You can't see me. This is bad luck. We don't need any more bad luck.",
        "Gus: Oh, come on, Honey. Everything that could have happened to us has already happened to us. Everything bad, there's nothing else could go wrong.",
        "Harley: Well, good. Keep thinking bad things. Keep thinking tornadoes and hurricanes and locusts and frogs. Think the worst wedding disaster ever. Think that.",
        "Gus: I think about us last year.",
        "Harley: Perfect!",
        "Gus: Okay.",
        "Harley: But I'm doing the opposite. Last year, I thought only the good things. This year, I'm thinking all bad things. I'm doing the opposite stuff.",
        "Gus: That's good.",
        "Harley: Because I love you and because I want this to happen so badly...",
        "Gus: I love you, too.",
        "Harley: I want to marry you more than anything else in the world, so having said that, Honey?",

        "Alan: Well? Do you like it?",
        "Beth: It's beautiful.",
        "Alan: It is beautiful, and it will be beautiful on your hand. You want to give it a test drive? Beth, listen to me. If we do this, don't think for one minute that you are betraying Phillip. You're not. You're doing the opposite. You're protecting his legacy from Gus and the Coopers. And more important, you are protecting your children.",
        "Beth: That's all I think about.",
        "Alan: I think you and I together will be able to ensure that Elizabeth and James have a wonderful future. What greater way to show your love to Phillip?",
        "Beth: It's a lot to wrap my head around. I'm not ready to give you an answer yet.",
        "Alan: I understand. Just take your time. But maybe you'll want to hold onto this, huh?",
        "Beth: I should go.",
        "Alan: Beth. Don't think of this as an engagement gift from me. Think of it as a token from Phillip. And I hope that one day very soon, you will wear it on your hand.",
        "Beth: Just taking a little test drive of my own. After all, if we're going to do this, we'll have to keep up appearances. I'll be in touch.",
        "Alan: Please do. It's the only way that I can bring you back, son.",

        "Gus: Baby?",
        "Harley: Yes?",
        "Gus: Please. I just want to see you. I love you.",
        "Harley: I want to see you, too.",
        "Gus: Okay, so just...",
        "Harley: But I don't want to risk it.",
        "Gus: Nothing... nothing's going to... what, are you superstitious all of a sudden?",
        "Harley: I just don't want anything bad to happen. Please get out.",
        "Gus: Nothing's going to... nothing's going to... I got it covered.",
        "Harley: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Gus: I got it covered. Don't you trust me? Look, last year, we had a little interference from my family.",
        "Harley: Uh-huh.",
        "Gus: My fault, wine cellar, I understand that, but that was fueled by pressure of Alexandra and Alan. But look, poor Phillip's gone, right? Alan's in jail. Alexandra, she doesn't have any claws. Are you listening to me?",
        "Harley: I'm here. I might want to go to the bathroom.",
        "Gus: Okay, so I'm going to tell you... this is a long story, short. I hired a couple of PI's to cover Alan, make sure he doesn't move, make sure he stays put.",
        "Harley: But he's already locked up.",
        "Gus: I'm just looking at it like a little extra protection. You know? You know what I'm saying?",
        "Harley: Mm-hmm.",
        "Gus: Uh-huh?",
        "Harley: ( Groans )",
        "Gus: Ow. Head vice. Ow.",
        "Harley: What happened?",
        "Gus: Nothing happened. What are you talking...",
        "Harley: Gus? Gus?",
        "Gus: All right, all right. I had a little special package delivered to me at my bachelor party.",
        "Harley: Something other than me?",
        "Gus: Yeah. It was... ( sighs ) ...a videotape. The videotape.",
        "Harley: The video...? The video of you and Alan and Alexandra in the wine cellar?",
        "Gus: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so you can imagine who sent that to me, right?",
        "Harley: Alan?",
        "Gus: Say that... why don't you try it one more time with a little more conviction.",
        "Harley: It was Alan, right?",
        "Gus: Because it wasn't Phillip because Phillip is...",
        "Harley: Because Phillip is dead.",
        "Gus: Exactly.",
        "Harley: It couldn't be Phillip because Phillip is dead and buried and gone.",
        "Gus: Let me in, babe. Come on. I want to see you.",
        "Harley: No. No. No, honey. Get out now.",
        "Gus: Ow.",
        "Harley: I'm serious.",
        "Gus: Ow!",
        "Harley: Get out. The next time you see me is going to be me walking down the aisle, so go.",
        "Gus: Okay, all right.",
        "Harley: Go, go, go. I'll see you there.",
        "Gus: See you there. See you there.",

        "Danny: Remember how Michelle called me the other night and said she was still in Africa? She wasn't. She was here. And I ran into her, right outside this place.",
        "Marina: And yet you didn't tell me.",
        "Danny: Well, that's because, Marina, when I'm with you I'm not exactly thinking about my ex-wife.",
        "Marina: Oh. Sounds good to me.",
        "Danny: Mm-hmm.",
        "Marina: So how is she? What, you're not going to tell me?",

        "Dinah: My, my, my, my. Somebody's very testy this morning.",
        "Edmund: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just, the divorce has generated more paperwork than I could possibly imagine. My lawyer suggested I keep everything in order, not to mention get these notarized, which I'm going to do right now.",
        "Dinah: Good. I'm just saying that I just... I want it in black and white that Dinah and Edmund get... ( Sighs ) I have such a headache right now. I don't know if I'm coming down with something.",
        "Edmund: Sweet dreams, Dinah. You're just probably fighting something off. Why don't you go home, get some rest, have some more of that vitamin drink I put aside for you and follow Dr. Edmund's orders because I need you strong for the next several weeks. All right?",
        "Dinah: One week. Hey. That's a correction. I want one week, and then we blow the baby secret to Cassie, and we move on with our lives. That was our deal. You promised. Oh, shoot.",
        "Edmund: What?",
        "Dinah: I...",
        "Edmund: Oh, here. Don't worry about it.",
        "Dinah: I feel bad, because these are...",
        "Edmund: They're fine, they're fine. Don't worry. They're fine, they're fine. They're fine. All right. No harm done, and I really have to be going. Bye, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: Wait.",

        "Cassie: It's so nice to finally be celebrating something good for a change, isn't it?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, it's very nice. I'm sorry, was that the correct \"well-trained\" response?",
        "Cassie: Oh, come on, Jeffrey. Blake was just saying what a good boyfriend you are.",
        "Buzz: And good boyfriends make great husbands. Watch out! Stop yourself, Cooper.",

        "Mel: What constitutes a \"normal\" wedding?",
        "Blake: Oh, well, you're talking to the wrong girl for that. I was almost shot in one of mine. ( Laughs )",

        "Blake: Oh, I wouldn't kid about that.",
        "Mel: Dear God.",

        "Blake: My guess: They're the next ones to walk down the aisle.",
        "Cassie: I didn't do anything.",
        "Jeffrey: No, it's fine. I haven't been a very good boyfriend-- as a matter of fact, I haven't been a boyfriend at all-- so it's nice to hear that I'm making improvement.",
        "Cassie: The real test comes later, at the reception.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, yeah? What happens there?",
        "Cassie: Well, you have to dance with me. A lot.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh. Well, you know, I can handle the getting close part. It's just the dancing part, I'm not very good at that.",
        "Cassie: Oh, we just get really, really close.",

        "Cassie: Dinah?",
        "Dinah: Hi. Well, don't the two of you look pretty?",
        "Cassie: Flattery will get you nowhere. What are you doing here? You should be home resting.",

        "Danny: Well, yeah, I hope so. You and I are moving in together.",
        "Marina: Which means I'm going to be a bigger part of Robbie's life now, and I think that it's really important that we're all getting along and being nice to each other. This is me being nice, welcoming Michelle back to Springfield with open arms.",
        "Danny: All right, but that's it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: You know what? Maybe you're right. Maybe we should go out together. Take a little walk.",
        "Bill: Yeah. I mean, if you're ready, let's...",

        "Michelle: He did?",
        "Marina: Yeah, of course. Why wouldn't he? So I guess you probably can't wait to see Robbie. I know he really missed you.",

        "Marina: Yes. We're at company. He says Hi. You know, I was thinking that we should all get together soon and catch up. I really miss you, Michelle, and I think that we could be good friends again, you know? Just as long as you and Danny and I are up-front and honest with each other, about everything.",

        "Beth: Harley. Sorry. The door was open. I just assumed that people would be coming and going all morning, helping you get ready. Where is everybody?",
        "Harley: Actually, I sent everyone ahead to Company. I needed some alone time.",
        "Beth: Oh. Oh, then I won't stay long. I just wanted to give you these.",
        "Harley: Oh, Beth, I couldn't.",
        "Beth: I want you to have them. They were Phillip's grandmothers and he gave them to me one year for my birthday.",
        "Harley: Well, even more reason for me to say no. I mean, they have sentimental value for you, Beth.",
        "Beth: And that's why I want you to have them. It would mean that we've come full circle, that we've really put our past behind us. Which I think is important, don't you? Now that Gus will be running Spaulding. I have no idea what you and he plan on doing with the company, let alone the family...",
        "Harley: You know what? That's all up to Gus. I'm staying out of that whole thing.",
        "Beth: But you and he must have discussed it. You must have some idea what he's thinking.",
        "Harley: I know that he wants to be a better influence on the family than Alan was. Beyond that, nothing.",
        "Beth: I see. Well, I hope you enjoy those.",
        "Harley: No, I... I...",
        "Beth: I absolutely insist. I'll see you at the ceremony. ( Laughter )",
        "Harley: Oh, Beth? I've been meaning to ask your take on what Alan's been saying, that he feels that Phillip is still alive?",
        "Beth: Poor Alan. He's really gone around the bend this time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Phillip is out there somewhere and at some point, he is going to reappear, and he is going to go after Harley.",
        "Gus: You don't believe that and neither do I, which is why you're going to sign this.",
        "Alan: What's that?",
        "Gus: It's just a little, sort of, Gag Order. It's going to get you to stop running your mouth, badgering Harley. It's a little wedding gift.",
        "Alan: That will never hold up in a court of law.",
        "Gus: Oh, I think it will. The family court of opinion, against you. You and all your girls, Beth and Lizzie and Alexandra, all of those girls. If you sign this and go back on your word, they won't be visiting you anymore.",
        "Alan: Don't you have a wedding to attend to?",
        "Gus: And of course you know I'm taking over Spaulding Enterprises, right? But here's my plan. See, I'm going to sell off your precious corporate legacy off piece by precious little piece to the lowest, sleaziest bidder if you don't sign this.",
        "Alan: Here you go.",
        "Gus: All right. Have it your way.",
        "Alan: All right, I'll sign it. There. It's signed. You know, someday you're going to realize that I'm not your biggest problem. Harley is!",

        "Mel: We have a major problem.",

        "Mel: The band's van broke down outside Bay City.",
        "Cassie: Okay, well, can it be fixed?",
        "Mel: No. And by the time they rent another van and transfer their equipment, they're not going to make it on time. Buzz? It's the band. What are you going to do?",
        "Cassie: Okay, what is in there?",
        "Edmund: Dinah, honestly. Your timing is disgusting. Cassie, I'm sorry but this is the divorce agreement. I gave it to Dinah to give it to you, but I never thought she'd do it at a wedding. Really, we can take care of this later.",
        "Cassie: Okay, let's do that.",
        "Edmund: Good.",
        "Cassie: Excuse me.",
        "Edmund: Thanks. You stole this from me.",
        "Dinah: Oh, pregnant woman. Be careful. I wanted to see what the mystery was all about.",
        "Edmund: No mystery, Dinah. I was in a rush.",
        "Dinah: And yet you're still here, hanging around. I want to know, is there a clause in that divorce settlement saying that you get the farm? Yes or no, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Yes. I told you, there's a clause. It's in here. A clause.",
        "Dinah: Good. Then show it to me. Right now.",

        "Michelle: Well, that's good.",
        "Marina: And what Danny and I have is rock solid. It took us a long time to get here because at first I was holding him at arm's length because I wanted him to make sure that he was really over you. And he's said a lot and shown me so much to prove to me that he really is. And now things are just... they're really awesome between us.",
        "Michelle: Oh, Marina, you know what? That's my other line. I'm going to have to go. We'll talk again later, okay? All right? Bye.",
        "Marina: Yeah, well, I'll see you around.",
        "Danny: Okay. Excuse me, did you really have to say all that?",
        "Marina: Yes, I did.",

        "Michelle: That's okay. Bill?",
        "Bill: Yeah?",
        "Michelle: Thank you for holding my hand, but you can go. You have a wedding to go to.",
        "Bill: Oh, no, no, no. Emma's not feeling too hot, so we're going to go a little later. So that's okay.",
        "Michelle: Just go. Just go, please. Please. Have a great time.",
        "Bill: Are you trying to get rid of me?",

        "Buzz: It's the guy who's supposed to give you away, but who's tempted to lock you in your room so you can't get away again.",
        "Harley: Come on in, Daddy. ( Laughs )",
        "Buzz: I know, I know, I'm early. I just wanted to have some time before we... does he know how lucky he is?",
        "Harley: Aw. Come here, Daddy.",
        "Buzz: I want the world for you.",
        "Harley: Thank you.",
        "Buzz: I want the world for you. I want this day to be a day to remember, and chase away all the bad ones.",
        "Harley: Aw.",
        "Buzz: I love you.",
        "Harley: I love you.",
        "Buzz: I've had an idea.",
        "Harley: Should I sit for this?",
        "Buzz: Yeah, you should sit for this. I have to run it by you, see if it's a good one.",
        "Harley: Okay.",
        "Buzz: Gus doesn't have a father. Joe, his adoptive father is dead, and is dead, and you can't count on Alan too much any more. So I was thinking that maybe if he needs to talk to somebody as sort of a surrogate, quasi kind of, you know... of the father-type persuasion... I don't know, it's probably...",
        "Harley: I think he would like that.",
        "Buzz: You think so? Because I think it's sort of weird. I don't want to scare him away.",
        "Harley: Well, then you don't say anything. I'll say something to him, okay?",
        "Buzz: Okay.",
        "Harley: I think he'll like it, really. Don't worry. I'll tell him. I'm not crazy about sharing you with somebody, but for Gus, I'll make that sacrifice.",
        "Buzz: Ditto, kiddo.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Show me.",
        "Edmund: Dinah, I'm so disappointed in you. Where's the faith? Where's the trust? Where's the love?",
        "Dinah: Where's the farm? In Cassie's name or yours?",
        "Edmund: Mine, of course. Ours. Dinah... sit. Sit right down here. Here it is. Read it for yourself. See the clause for yourself.",
        "Dinah: Oh, just open it.",
        "Edmund: Bottom of the page. Satisfied?",
        "Dinah: It says we have the farm.",
        "Edmund: Right. We have the farm, where we will live happily ever after. Now if you will excuse me, I have to get going.",

        "Jeffrey: Be right back. Cassie, no.",
        "Cassie: Oh, come on. Hey, look, your band members might feel a little differently. I'm sure they won't mind making a few hundred bucks.",
        "Jeffrey: They don't do weddings.",
        "Cassie: Why not?",
        "Jeffrey: Why not? Well, let's see. \"The bride cuts the cake.\" Endless renditions of \"Celebrate\" the obligatory waltz. Disco.",
        "Cassie: Okay, okay, okay. Then don't do the standard stuff. Play your own music.",
        "Jeffrey: Read my lips: No.",
        "Cassie: Okay, so you don't do weddings, huh? Or is it just weddings in general you don't like?",
        "Cassie: ( Laughs ) I'm joking! I'm just joking. Oh, my gosh, please. I have no desire to walk down the aisle again, or certainly not for a long, long time. I love the way things are between us.",

        "Edmund: Good. Well, you should be very happy, Michelle. You have no idea how lucky you are.",
        "Michelle: I am happy and, no, I do. It's just that circumstances aren't... they just... they are what they are. And thank you for your discretion. Okay?",

        "Gus: I'm very devious. Very, very, very devious.",
        "Harley: You did this for me?",
        "Gus: Us. So this way we can put the whole Phillip saga behind us and start our lives. So what do you say, honey? Should we do what every loving couple does on their wedding day and dig up a body?",
