        "Dinah: Has anyone called my lawyer. Has anyone called about me at all? Hello! \r\nHey, I'm talking to you. Hello. Any of you bozo\u2019s know anything about anything.\r\n",
        "Gus: Here is your card. ",
        "Dinah: Thank you, thank you, finally. Finally you guys are here. I thought \r\nthey called, and I need to take a shower. I need to get out of here. ",
        "Gus: Have you spoken to Mallet. ",
        "Dinah: Yes, he's the one who got me in here because he doesn't trust me. Can \r\nyou get me out. ",
        "Harley: Slow down a second, Dinah. We're not here to get you out. We're here \r\nto ask you some questions. ",

        "Jeffrey: Yeah! I'm afraid you got the wrong room. It's kind of confusing with \r\nall of the redecorating going on. What is it? I've had a long day, Detective.\r\n",
        "Mallet: I want to know what the hell is going on between you and my fianc\u00e9.\r\n",

        "Beth: Alan, we're going about this all wrong. Fighting with Jonathan is just \r\npushing Lizzie away. ",
        "Alan: I agree. ",
        "Beth: She believes we're ganging up on her, and that is not good for her or \r\nthe baby. ",
        "Alan: You're absolutely right. Hi. ",
        "Beth: What's going on? ",
        "Alan-Michael: Ask dad, he called this pow-wow. ",
        "Beth: Alan. ",
        "Alan: I want to thank you all for coming. I know we all have our family \r\ndifferences, but when a family member is in crisis, we all pull together. ",
        "Lillian: You said on the phone that Lizzie was in trouble. ",
        "Alexandra: And you're rallying the troops. ",
        "Beth: Alan. She thinks the whole family is against her. ",
        "Alan: We're not against her. We're trying to help her. ",
        "Alan Michael: What makes you think she needs our help. ",
        "Alan: Alan-Michael, her behavior is becoming more and more erratic every day. \r\nAnd she's starting to remind me of Phillip. ",
        "Beth: Phillip. ",
        "Alexandra: Oh, for heaven's sake. She is worried about her baby. ",
        "Alan: She has nothing to worry about. She is losing her grasp on reality. \r\nShe's putting the family, herself, and most important, her baby. ",
        "",
        "Lizzie: You're closing. ",
        "Clerk: Ms. Spaulding\u2014Hi.",
        "Lizzie: You said that the toys were in? ",
        "Clerk: They were picked up already. ",
        "Lizzie: By whom? ",
        "Clerk: A man in a limousine. ",
        "Lizzie: Granddad, what exactly did he pick up? ",
        "Clerk: Just about anything a baby could possibly need. ",
        "",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie is gone? ",
        "Tammy: Yup. ",
        "Jonathan: I thought she would never leave again. ",
        "Tammy: She was pretty freaked about Alan. ",
        "Jonathan: I thought a new room would be enough, but I don't think she has \r\nslept in days. ",
        "Tammy: You can't blame her. Thinking that Alan is going to do something to \r\nthe baby. ",
        "Jonathan: As soon as that baby is born, Lizzie will move out and get her own \r\nplace. ",
        "Tammy: You might think that, but Lizzie, she thinks we're going to keep \r\nliving together, long after the baby is born. ",
        "",
        "Beth: Okay, family meeting is over. ",
        "Alan: Beth, you can't dismiss us. We just started our meeting. ",
        "Beth: Lizzie is my daughter, I will handle things the way I see fit. ",
        "Alan Michael: And how would that be? ",
        "Beth: One-on-one. You don't need to be involved. ",
        "Alan: What is wrong with a little family support, Beth? ",
        "Alexandra: As long as that is all it is. ",
        "Alan: You accusing me of something. ",
        "Lillian: Beth, is there anything we can do? ",
        "Beth: No, no. There is nothing I can't handle here. Thank you all for coming. \r\nAnd if you'll excuse me. ",
        "Alan: Where you going? ",
        "Beth: To see my daughter! ",
        "Alan: You'll have to excuse Beth. It is very difficult for her to accept the \r\nfact that Elizabeth is slipping again. ",
        "Alexandra: Alan, do you really believe that? ",
        "Alan: Yes. That's why I think it is very important for the family to unify \r\nand help her. ",
        "Alan-Michael: How about a group hug then? Dad, it sounds like an ambush to \r\nme. ",
        "Lillian: Alan, you said before Lizzie is behaving erratically. ",
        "Alan: Yes, she is convinced that someone is following her. ",
        "Alexandra: Someone? ",
        "Alan: Someone is trying to kidnap her. ",
        "Alan-Michael: You did kidnap her. Is that why she put the meat cleaver in \r\nyour carry-on? ",
        "Lillian: Meat cleaver? ",
        "Alan: There was no kidnapping, and the meat cleaver event was probably \r\norchestrated by Jonathan Randall, because Beth and I convinced her to come to \r\nItaly with us and have the baby. ",
        "Alexandra: But she didn't want to go. ",
        "Alan: She doesn't know what she wants. I'm not trying to hatch some plan \r\nhere. ",
        "Alan-Michael: What are you trying to do? ",
        "Alan: I think it would be best for the family to nurture her, support her, \r\nand try to get her back into the family fold. Now surely no one in the family \r\nwould object to that, would they? Lillian? ",
        "Lillian: Obviously, I just want her to be happy. ",
        "Lizzie: What's going on? ",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, I was just telling everyone how worried I was about you. ",
        "Lizzie: Really. Wow. Did he tell you that he is trying to steal my baby? It's \r\ntrue. He tried to have me grabbed. ",
        "Lillian: Lizzie, sweetie. ",
        "Lizzie: No, you're not going to stop until you've taken her from me. What is \r\nthe plan? Trying to make me seem insane. ",
        "Alan: Lizzie-- ",
        "Lizzie: Don't bother denying it. You believe me, Nana, don't you? ",
        "Lillian: Of course I believe it. But what I\u2019d like right now is for you and \r\nme to go to the kitchen and get some lemonade. ",
        "Lizzie: Oh, my god, he has gotten to you, too. ",
        "",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie is crazy if she thinks we're all going to live together \r\nafter the baby is born. ",
        "Tammy: Well, that's what she thinks. ",
        "Jonathan: I'll have to set her straight because that is not happening. ",
        "Tammy: We may not have a choice. ",
        "Jonathan: The hell we don\u2019t. I want to be a part of that kid's life, but you \r\nand I need our own life. ",
        "Tammy: And what if Alan swoops right in? ",
        "Jonathan: We can handle Alan. ",
        "Tammy: But can Lizzie? Oh, Lizzie will never be able to handle it on her own.\r\n",
        "Jonathan: We'll figure it out tomorrow. Let's go get something to eat. ",
        "Tammy: Fo' sho'. ",
        "Beth: I'm here to see Lizzie. ",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie is not here. ",
        "Beth: Well, then, do you know where she is? ",
        "Tammy: Out buying a few things for the baby. We'll tell her you stopped by.\r\n",
        "Beth: Okay. I did come to see my daughter, but I'm glad to have a moment \r\nalone with you. ",
        "Jonathan: Well, that makes one of us. ",
        "Beth: It's not what you think. I need your help. ",

        "Jeffrey: It has been a long time since I had to face down a jealous \r\nboyfriend. Are you going to hit me? ",
        "Mallet: I haven't decided then. On second, maybe I should. ",
        "Jeffrey: Well, then, you'll lose your job. ",
        "Mallet: If you want to get me fired, that is going to raise a lot of \r\nquestions. Questions from the press. Questions from Doris Wolfe. Jeffrey, what \r\nare you going to tell her? ",
        "Jeffrey: That's easy. I'll just tell her the jealous boyfriend lost his cool.\r\n",
        "Mallet: I trust Dinah, but it's you I don't trust. ",
        "Jeffrey: You want to clarify? ",
        "Mallet: You knew about Dinah and the fire and you took away the evidence. ",
        "Jeffrey: I have no idea what you're talking about. ",
        "Mallet: Want to clarify. Why did you protect Dinah? What does she have on \r\nyou? ",
        "",
        "Dinah: So before you guys, who are my so-called friends, decide to question \r\nme, I have one question of my own. ",
        "Gus: Go ahead. ",
        "Dinah: Which one is good cop, and which one is bad cop. Just so I know. ",
        "Harley: No, no, no. We both are good cops and we are your friends. ",
        "Gus: We just came to get the facts straight. ",
        "Dinah: Okay, what's up? ",
        "Gus: Well, the fire marshal thinks you may have had something to do with \r\nsetting the fire. ",
        "Dinah: Well, Gus, what do you think? Harley, what do you think? ",
        "Harley: What does it matter what I think? ",
        "Dinah: It does matter because either you support me or you don't support me. \r\nWhy don't you answer me and tell me if you believe I did it? ",
        "Harley: No, Dinah, but you have been known to get angry. ",
        "Dinah: So I burn down an entire hotel? ",
        "Gus: We're saying we know you've been known to get upset. ",
        "Harley: We're not saying you did it. ",
        "Dinah: Is Gus the good cop or the bad cop? ",
        "Gus: I'll be the bad cop. ",
        "Dinah: Why don't you slap me around. ",
        "Gus: Do you have something to confess? ",
        "Dinah: I guess that's why you apologized to Reva Lewis for almost mowing her \r\ndown. ",
        "Harley: Why don't we stick to the facts of the case. ",
        "Dinah: Is it relevant that your husband, who was so jacked on pills he almost \r\nkilled someone. There are two sets of rules, one for the cops, and one for the \r\ninnocent civilians which you're trying to railroad. ",
        "Harley: Nobody is trying to railroad anybody. ",
        "Dinah: I didn't do anything, and I'm behind bars. And Gus, who has broken \r\nabout three or four laws that I know of, is standing there free, questioning me! \r\nWhy don't you tell me what is wrong with this picture? ",
        "Dinah: You know, I helped you at the lowest point in your life, and this is \r\nhow you repay me? ",
        "Gus: We're just trying to do our job, honestly. ",
        "Dinah: So is that it? You guys just kind of turn it off. You turn it off, \r\nyou're the cop, I'm the perp, and our friendship just goes right to hell. ",
        "Harley: Dinah, it isn't like that. ",
        "Dinah: Oh, really, what's it like, Harley. I think you know better than \r\nanyone what prison did to me. ",
        "Harley: Nobody wants you to go back to prison. ",
        "Dinah: Yet if you do things Gus' way and you do your job, that's pretty well \r\nhow it is going to end up. ",
        "Gus: No it isn't how it is going to end up. We're just going to ask you some \r\nquestions and you're going to answer, okay? ",
        "Dinah: No. ",
        "Gus: Why you got to be like that? Innocent people have nothing to hide. ",
        "Dinah: Then maybe I should tell Frank what you did behind the wheel. ",
        "Gus: You think you have something to tell Frank. Tell him what you want to \r\ntell him. ",
        "Dinah: Maybe we can share a cell. ",
        "Gus: You trying to be a rattle our cage, here? ",
        "Dinah: No, no, you guys are professional. I wouldn't think of doing that. ",
        "Harley: Dinah, I can see where Mallet would do something to make you crazy. \r\nYou're trying to get even. It gets out of hand. I know you would never \r\nintentionally burn down a hotel. But you've got to help us out. You want us to \r\nclear your name, give us something. ",
        "Dinah: Okay. You were my friend and my bridesmaid, and it will always be \r\nabout Mallet. ",
        "Harley: What? ",
        "Dinah: You don't want me to marry him because then he won't be free to pine \r\nafter you, is that right? ",
        "Harley: Dinah. ",
        "Dinah: You hear that, Gus. You've got a wife, that's for sure, but she is \r\nstill all about Mallet. ",
        "Frank: What's going on here? ",
        "Dinah: You guys want to tell him, or should I? ",
        "",
        "Jeffrey: Dinah and I are friends, we share a past. End of story. ",
        "Mallet: Right, so everything I saw going on between you two was just \r\nperfectly innocent. ",
        "Jeffrey: Well, if that helps you sleep at night. ",
        "Mallet: So what did you shake on? ",
        "Jeffrey: Look, you trust your girlfriend so much, why don't you just ask her.\r\n",
        "Mallet: I'm asking you. What's the big secret? ",
        "Jeffrey: We have a campaign promise that we made to each other. A campaign \r\npromise. Dinah's going to deliver the Spaulding endorsement, and I'm going to \r\nthrow some tax incentives their way. ",
        "Mallet: That's it? ",
        "Jeffrey: Not juicy enough for you. ",
        "Mallet: Why didn't you just tell me that in the beginning. ",
        "Jeffrey: Some people have a problem with the ethics of that. People grease \r\neach other's palms all the time-- ",
        "Mallet: I don't need a civic lesson to know tossing your hat in the ring with \r\na suspected arsonist-- ",
        "Jeffrey: Suspected. Dinah is innocent until proven guilty. What were you \r\nsaying about trust? ",
        "Mallet: It doesn't matter if she is innocent or guilty. I love her, no matter \r\nwhat. ",
        "Jeffrey: You should write greeting cards. ",
        "Mallet: There is so much more going on here. ",
        "Jeffrey: I'm not going to lose anymore sleep over this. I've got a lot of \r\nwork to do, Detective. Thanks for stopping by. Good night, Detective. ",

        "Jonathan: You think we're stupid enough to fall for another one of your \r\ntricks. Get a life, lady. ",
        "Beth: It's not a trick. Just listen to me. Tammy, I know you have no reason \r\nto trust me. You came to me once, and I treated you like dirt. But I was wrong. \r\nJust hear me out for Lizzie\u2019s sake. ",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie's sake? You've been with Alan on this whole thing. ",
        "Beth: Because I thought I was doing what is best for my daughter. But this \r\ntug-of-war is tearing her apart. It's not good for her or the baby. ",

        "Jonathan: You didn't seem so sorry the other day. ",
        "Beth: That was a wake-up call. Seeing Lizzie react so strongly, I never \r\nthought it would play out that way. ",

        "Beth: I thought she was going to come back home. ",
        "Jonathan: Wrong answer. For her, money is like oxygen. You knew she was going \r\nto flip out. ",
