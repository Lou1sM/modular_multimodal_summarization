For good reason. It's all right, it's all right. \nCassie: I just want to get out of here. \nEdmund: It's okay. Let's just see if you're all right first. \nCassie: I'm fine! \nEdmund: Just walk. Walk for me, all right? Just walk. You all right? \nCassie: When I saw your car coming at me, I just... after everything that happened, I thought that you were going to run me down. Why are they doing this? Why are these people doing this to me? God, it was one thing when they were across the ocean and they were going to fancy parties and signing my name to room-service bills. But what's next? What if they come after the children? \nEdmund: God, I hate this! (Crashing) I hate that I haven't been able to take care of you and the children! You've got slashed tires! I can't do anything to protect you! Cassie, cassie, I have to do something about it. I have to do something about this now. \nCassie: We don't know these people, edmund, and we don't know their limits, okay? \nEdmund: Cassie... \nCassie: Edmund, just stop, okay? I just want to go. I just want to go. \nEdmund: But... \nCassie: Look, just put the tire iron back. \nEdmund: All right. Okay, well, we'll go upstairs and we'll call the police. Cassie? \nCassie: Oh. Uh, just getting the keys. \nEdmund: Look, maybe it's a better idea if I drive you back to the farm. \nCassie: Why don't you go ahead and go, and I'll meet you there. I'm going to have to get, like, new tires. \nEdmund: Well, just... (laughs) don't be ridiculous. I'll take you back to the farm and we can take care of the tires later. \nCassie: I need to do this. \nEdmund: All right, if you're sure that... \nCassie: I am. Thank you. Thank you for saving me and for wanting to protect me. \nEdmund: Right. Well, hurry home.

Well, I will say that you are the ceo that every employee would dream about. \nMichelle: Aren't you a little overdressed for this outing? \nTony: Well, you didn't exactly give me enough time to grab my swim gear now, did you? \nMichelle: (Sighs) what have you got? Boxers or briefs? \nTony: Why? \nMichelle: It's close enough to a bathing suit, right? \nTony: This is a public beach, michelle. People do bring their kids here. \nMichelle: Oh, please. You're not that uptight. Come on. \nTony: Hey. Boxer briefs are not bathing suits, sorry. \nMichelle: No one's going to know the difference but you. Come on. Unless you're afraid. \nTony: Oh, you're going to go there again. I'm afraid? \nMichelle: (Spooky humming) \nTony: All right. A challenge, right? Okay. \nMichelle: Mm-hmm. Works every time. \nTony: There. I'm telling you, if I get arrested for indecent exposure, you better... \nMichelle: I will. \nTony: You better bail me out. \nMichelle: I will. \nTony: Okay? \nMichelle: Got you covered. \nTony: Yeah, I'm sure you do. \nMichelle: Wow. \nTony: There. \nMichelle: I thought... \nTony: What? \nMichelle: I don't know, i just... \nTony: What? \nMichelle: I was expecting leopard stripes, silk, something.

How's your dad doing? \nMarina: Like you care. \nAlan: Well, I thought I heard your voice. \nGus: Hey. \nAlan: Welcome home, son. \nGus: Thank you. \nAlan: Why don't you come in and tell me about your trip, huh? \nGus: It'S... you've got people waiting. \nMarina: Oh, it's okay. We're not important. \nAlan: Marina, don't you have some trash to take out or something to sweep up?\nMarina: As a matter of fact, I'm here about that job description. But danny's got first dibs on your valuable time. \nGus: Why don't you two talk? I'd like to talk to her anyway, if that's okay.\nAlan: All right. Enjoy. Danny, it's always good to see you. \nDanny: How are you? \nAlan: Why don't you come in and tell me how your family is? \nMarina: \"How's the family?\" You mean what's left of it after vinnie salerno finished with them. Only a spaulding could be so cold. \nGus: Hmm. So we're all targets now, is that it? \nMarina: Oh, you and your family made a big mistake taking on the coopers. \nGus: You can't possibly think that I would purposely try to hurt people in your family. \nMarina: My dad lost his job and darci. My grandfather is nursing a broken heart after your dear old auntie alex betrayed him. And aunt harley? Her whole world was run over by a meat truck. All because of you. I hope she gave it to you good when she tracked you down. \nGus: She was looking for me? \nMarina: Oh, don't get your hopes all up, gus, okay? It was an act of desperation.

You wouldn't be sitting behind that desk of yours right now if it weren't for me. \nAlan: What are you talking about? \nDanny: If I hadn't gone undercover and found the link between the mob and the drug ring, the feds would have shut down spaulding permanently. \nAlan: Danny, you want me to thank you for the way that drug bust was bungled? My sister is in jail being charged with a crime that was committed by brad green. Gus's sister was killed in a warehouse explosion that you set off. \nDanny: No, no, no. I don't want you to thank me. I want you to listen to my proposal for fifth street. Now, there have been some potential backers who have become a little skittish because of the junk that they've been reading in the papers, but i know you've got a lot more business sense than the rest of them. Josh lewis, for one. \nAlan: So the righteous have all jumped ship, huh? \nDanny: Yeah, something like that. \nAlan: Very well. I'm listening.

I was just trying to call you. \nJeffrey: Okay, what happened? Did you see who it was? \nCassie: They got into my house and they were messing with my computer. Then someone stole my sunglasses, and then I went down to the garage, and both my tires were slashed, and then I heard someone coming after me, but then a car was coming after me, but that turned out to be edmund. \nJeffrey: Wait. Slow down. All right, you need a drink. Come on. \nCassie: No, what I need is for you to find out who is doing this to me. Now it feels real. Now they're here, jeffrey. They were in my house. My children could have been there. \nJeffrey: They were in your house? They were at the farm? You're sure about that? \nCassie: Well, I wasn't until this. \nCassie: It was in my closet at the farm, and I know it's the same one. The boys. Jeffrey, the boys... \nJeffrey: The boys... the boys... the boys are fine. They boys are with mrs. Chitwood out by the pool. Everyone's safe, okay? Everyone is safe. Now, tell me where did you find this? \nCassie: In the garage under the car. The person left this and they wanted me to know that they were in my house. \nJeffrey: Does edmund know about it? \nCassie: No. No, I couldn't tell him. \nJeffrey: Well, why not? \nCassie: Because I was afraid how he was going to react. Jeffrey, you have to find them. You've got to find them. My kids have been through so much. (Sobbing) \nJeffrey: Take it easy. Take it easy. Come here. It's going to be all right.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: Catch. I'm putting water skiing on the weekly agenda, I'm telling you. \nTony: Yeah, I'm sure you are. Listen, did you have any idea what you were doing when you grabbed that tow rope and the boat was pulling you around? Did you have any idea? \nMichelle: No. No, but it looked like fun, and it was. \nTony: Yeah, well, even if you... (laughs) even if you belly-flopped, which you did, even if you lost your bikini top, which you didn'T. \nMichelle: Thanks for noticing, but it was amazing. \nTony: Well, you're amazing, michelle. You know that? \nMichelle: Really? \nTony: Yeah, you are. \nMichelle: You mean that? \nTony: Don't let it get to your head, okay? \nMichelle: Yeah, no problems there. You know, you're really the only person here who says something like that and means it. Everyone else is just being nice and humoring me until I get my memory back, until I snap out of it. \nTony: In my opinion, there's nothing to snap out of. \nMichelle: Thank you. \nTony: Mm-hmm. \nMichelle: You know, I'm finally taking your advice. \nTony: Well, I'm not sure if that's a good thing. What did I say? \nMichelle: You told me not to worry about the person I turned out to be, that everyone would adjust and if they couldn't or didn't, that's their problem, not mine. \nTony: I said that? \nMichelle: Mm-hmm. Yeah, and you're right. You know, first you save my life, and then you gave me the okay to live my life the way i wanted, and I owe you for that. \nTony: Uh-uh. \nMichelle: Yeah. \nTony: Uh-uh. \nMichelle: No, I do. \nTony: You do not owe me anything. Nothing. \nMichelle: I do. \nTony: No. \nMichelle: You've given me a lot, tony, and if things actually work out with danny and me, it's going to be because of you.

Now, if you take a look, these are the figures right here. And I'm willing to open my books to you, if that's what you want. That is no problem for me, and you can see that this is the kind of investment that will pay well into the future, and not just for springfield, but for you and for your grandchildren. And here I've got some projected earnings, and based on what I've already accomplished there, frankly, I think they're pretty conservative myself. Yeah. Thank you for your time. I appreciate it. \nAlan: Well, danny, don't give up so easily. Come on. \nDanny: Alan, either you want in or you don'T. \nAlan: I didn't say I wasn't interested. \nDanny: You didn't say anything. \nAlan: All right. Here. Here is my offer to you. \nDanny: (Scoffs) you're not serious. \nAlan: You don't expect me to pay top dollar for something you can't even give away, do you? \nDanny: Alan, this... this isn't even close. \nAlan: Think about it, danny.

Big surprise. \nMarina: Look, danny, you're better off not getting mixed up with the spauldings. Besides, look what they did to my family-- and that's to people they claim to love. \nDanny: Yeah. You're next, chief. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: Right. \nMarina: I was here first. \nAlan: Well, son, I am so glad to see you. So, sit down and tell me about your trip. \nGus: Just when I thought this family had hit an all-time low, I see that it has sunk even further.

I mean, you should have seen the look in his eyes when he realized someone had slashed my tires. \nJeffrey: Well, I can't say i blame him. \nCassie: I haven't seen that look in a long time. Edmund has come a long way, you know. Any man would want to protect the woman he loves, so... \nJeffrey: But edmund's brand of protection is dangerous. \nCassie: I'm not saying that. I just don't want to put him in that position, that's all. \nJeffrey: I understand, i think. \nCassie: But I don't want you to get the wrong idea about edmund, okay, because he cares. He cares a lot. It's just that he's very afraid and he always has been afraid that something was going to happen or someone was going to take me or the kids away. And just sometimes I feel like he wants to lock... never mind. \nJeffrey: Okay. \nCassie: Look, I'm telling you this because edmund loves me and he's thinking with his heart, not with his head. But with you it's different, you know? With you, it's just strictly business. I mean, there's nothing personal, right? So I can trust you to go after this woman, whoever she is, who's impersonating me without damaging anything, right? \nJeffrey: Hmm. \nCassie: Jeffrey, am I boring you? I'm talking about my life here. \nJeffrey: No, I'm sorry. Listen, I think I know of a way I can protect you. That is, if you'll go for it. \nCassie: Of course. I don't want to stay here and wait for another planter to fall on my head. What do you want me to do? \nJeffrey: I want you to pack your bags and move into the beacon, with me.

It was good. I just... you know, it's time to get back to work. I think we should. I don't want to put all this time and effort in getting light up and running, and then your buddy ross comes and he shuts us down on a technicality, you know?

My family is about to be kicked to the curb because of the spauldings, literally kicked to the curb. \nDanny: Yeah, I know. I know. I heard. \nMarina: They think they can just pay my grandpa off and he'll crawl into a hole and just go away. We're going to fight them every step of the way, even if it means living in a cardboard box. \nDanny: It'd have to be a pretty big box. \nMarina: Yeah, well, maybe we'll be neighbors. \nDanny: I can't afford to do that.

All the money in the world couldn't get buzz to part with that beloved coffee shop of his, okay? It's his life. It's his life. Not to mention the fact that it's, like, a landmark in this town. \nAlan: You cannot get sentimental about something like this. Change is always tough. \nGus: The coopers don't deserve this, okay, so you stop the project. \nAlan: I can't do that. You see, phillip is in charge. \nGus: What, are you saying you can't stop phillip? Of course you can. \nAlan: I can't, but if you want to, maybe you should consider coming back to work at spaulding. I mean, it would give you a chance to battle your brother behind the scenes. That is, if this means so much to you. \nGus: Wait a second, wait a second. Is that why you let phillip get so far with this, so that i would put a suit back on and you could see me walking around spaulding again? \nAlan: No, not at all. But it would give you an opportunity, gus, to help your family and also score a few points with harley. That is, if you still love her.\nGus: Why do you even have to ask that?

Filling my head with doubts about cassie, about jeffrey, doubts about me.\nDinah: I was just trying to help. \nEdmund: (Laughs) \"just trying to help.\" Well, why don't you come clean, dee, or whoever you are? Why don't you come clean and tell me your full name and address and a telephone number? \nDinah: So you can tell jeffrey? Do you have any idea what he would do to me if he found out i was trying to protect cassie from him? \nEdmund: Why should I care? Why shouldn't jeffrey o'neill be like every other man? Why shouldn't he be attracted to cassie? She's a beautiful, desirable woman. \nDinah: She's one of a kind, that's for sure. \nEdmund: And she loves me. So I don't care if jeffrey o'neill has feelings for cassie. I don't care. I don't care if he's hanging around springfield when he's on leave from the feds. I don't care. He doesn't stand a chance because she still loves me. \nDinah: Jeffrey plays dangerous games with women. You don't trust him. You told me that yourself. \nEdmund: No, I don't trust him, but I do trust cassie. \nDinah: Then why are you attacking a woodpile like an ax murderer? \nEdmund: Why are you doing this to me? Why? I mean, you drop by here and you stuff poison in my ear abut jeffrey, about... about... about... about cassie. And then you disappear without a trace. And here I am left to pick up the pieces of innuendo and threats about cassie and the life we're trying to build together. What is this about? \nDinah: I'm sorry. I understand. You know, I know what it is to love someone, have a beautiful place like this, and then something happens one day and they're gone. And once you've known a love like that, you don't get over it. You can'T.\nEdmund: What is that about? Is that about you and jeffrey? \nDinah: This is about you and cassie. You need to focus on cassie, and whatever jeffrey's up to, don't doubt cassie.

Winslow, not a proposition, okay? \nCassie: I can't just leave the children. \nJeffrey: I don't want you to leave the children. I want you to bring the children here, of course. That farm is out there, it's isolated, it's unprotected, and it's unsafe. I can maintain better security here. \nCassie: It's not much better here. Rj and I were almost flattened by a planter out front, and my tires were slashed in the parking garage here. \nJeffrey: It is better here. It's still better here than the farm. Someone just went out there and rifled through your closets, mrs. Winslow. Come on. \nCassie: I just want to burn my clothes. \nJeffrey: Don't burn your clothes, bring them here. I can recommend the laundry service at the hotel. It's very good. Look, it's time for us to go on the attack. \nCassie: I am on the attack. I'm having a new security system installed here in the beacon, inside and out, and I can do the same thing at the farm. \nJeffrey: You don't understand. Listen to me. If I get you and the kids here, out of the farm, I can use the farm to spring a trap for whoever this is that's doing this. Okay? I can lure them there and put them out of commission once and for all. So what do you say? \nCassie: Okay. Okay. \nJeffrey: Okay, good. \nCassie: On one condition. \nJeffrey: Any condition you want. \nCassie: You have to work with edmund every step of the way through this. \nJeffrey: (Laughs) you've got to be kidding me, right? You just said... \nCassie: Then no deal. No deal. \nJeffrey: Mrs. Winslow-- cassie-- are you going to tell me you're just going to hang around and wait for the next attack because we won't include lover boy?\nCassie: You know, maybe edmund's right.

I'm fine. \nJeffrey: Yeah, she's fine, and it's not my fault. \nEdmund: What's going on with this? \nCassie: Um, I found that in the garage under my car. Someone had left it there. I found it after you left. \nEdmund: The people who slashed your tires? \nCassie: Yeah. And when I came up here, jeffrey was here, so I just told him all about it. \nEdmund: Mr. O'neill, I assume you're going to make a full report of this to your government agency, seeing as you're still heading up the federal investigation, aren't you? \nJeffrey: Yeah. We're working on that. \nEdmund: Good. Thank you. \nJeffrey: Okay. \nEdmund: So the only thing that remains is to make sure you and the children are protected, right? \nCassie: Yeah.
