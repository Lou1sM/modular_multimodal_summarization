        "Buzz: Hmm, eat your heart out, celebrity chef, and I mean literally. Come in! \r\nOlivia? ",
        "Coop: Nope, it's just us. Wow, the place looks great. You can't even tell \r\nthere was a fire. ",
        "Buzz: There's more work to be done. She started with the rooms. ",
        "Ava: Hey, nice spread you got here. Can I help you with something? ",
        "Buzz: What are you guys doing here? ",
        "Coop: Olivia invited us, remember? So that we could all just sit and chill so \r\nwe could get past this whole fire thing. ",
        "Buzz: Well-- great, but don't you think it's just a little too soon? ",
        "Coop: Look, Pop, we didn't sit in that jail cell driving each other crazy for \r\nnothing, I hope. We didn't, did we? Because I would really like to get past \r\nthis, and I hope you do, too. ",
        "Buzz: Absolutely. ",
        "Coop: And us being here is Ava\u2019s idea. She was the one who got injured, so if \r\nAva can move past it, then... ",
        "Buzz: I can't tell you how much this means to me. ",
        "Ava: We just want you to be happy, Buzz. ",
        "Coop: And if you being happy means accepting Olivia, then we'll accept her.\r\n",
        "Buzz: You guys! You guys! Come here. ",
        "",
        "Frank: These are the same photos that are on that web site. Why would Olivia \r\nhave these pictures? Unless she's the one behind the Springfieldburns.com. Looks \r\nlike Olivia is back to her old tricks. This is going to kill dad. ",
        "",
        "Cassie: So here we are sitting together. ",
        "Josh: Yes, we are, and there is no thunder or lightning or floods or \r\nearthquakes or fires or anything. ",
        "Cassie: What about angry, protective fathers? ",
        "Josh: Yes, well, Hawk is Hawk, you know. And he loves Reva, and he doesn't \r\nwant to see anything happen to her. ( Laughter ) That was either Hawk or Billy, \r\nI'm not really sure. Listen, think of it this way: That's probably the worst \r\nreaction we're going to get from anybody, so everything else from here on in \r\nwill be... ",
        "Cassie: Oh, come on, you ordered that cake on purpose. ",
        "Josh: Maybe so, yes. ",
        "Cassie: ( Clears throat ) ",
        "Olivia: Hey. ",
        "Josh: Hi. ",
        "Olivia: So what do you think you two are doing? ",
        "Josh: Um... ",
        "Olivia: Didn't Gary invite you? Tonight I'm inviting people over to the \r\nBeacon for the celebration of the reopening. ",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I'm sorry. I completely forgot. ",
        "Olivia: That's fine, but you're going to come though, right? I could use your \r\nfeedback on the plans. ",
        "Cassie: I'll stop by. ",
        "Olivia: And, Josh, you're welcome to come, and bring Reva. ",
        "Josh: Reva's out of town. In fact, she has been out of town for quite some \r\ntime. ",
        "Olivia: Well, then, you're welcome to come alone. ",
        "Josh: No, I think I'll bring somebody. Cassie will be my date because... \r\nwell, because we're seeing each other these days. ",
        "",
        "Reva: Where am I? ",
        "Billy: Well, you're in a hotel room in New York. Remember, you saw your kids. \r\nDon't worry about it. Just rest, okay. ",
        "Reva: Yeah, like I have a choice. I feel so weak, Billy. I've got to get \r\nstrong so I can get on a plane and go home and face Josh and Cassie. I'm going \r\nto need all my strength to do that. ",
        "",
        "Jonathan: Is that what it's like? ",
        "Tammy: What? ",
        "Jonathan: To be engaged. We are engaged, right? ",
        "Tammy: You asked me to marry you and I said yes. That's usually how it works.\r\n",
        "Jonathan: There is nothing too usual about what is going on around here \r\nlately. ",
        "Tammy: You mean most engaged couples don't live with the guy's baby mama. ",
        "Jonathan: Do you think Lizzie will be cool with this? ",
        "Tammy: Eventually. But I think we should hold off on telling her. She is \r\nreally scared of Alan, and I don't want her to think we're abandoning her. ",
        "Jonathan: Agreed. As long as we know. ",
        "Lizzie: Oops. Sorry. ",
        "Jonathan: No, no problem. ",
        "Lizzie: You guys want to get dinner? My treat? ",
        "Tammy: Got gum in there? ",
        "Lizzie: What? No. Why would I? ",
        "Tammy: Gum. I don't know, you usually have gum. ",
        "Lizzie: Oh, uh... gum, no. ",
        "Jonathan: Are you sure, because I'm pretty sure I saw... ",
        "Lizzie: Would you just stop it! I'm sorry I yelled. Even though we live \r\ntogether, I'm still entitled to my privacy. ",
        "Jonathan: What have you got in there that is so top secret? ",
        "Lizzie: Nothing, nothing! It's nothing. I'm just a little on edge. ",
        "Jonathan: Really, I didn't notice? ",
        "Lizzie: Okay, I'm sorry, can you blame me? My granddad has been after us, and \r\nall I want to do is protect my baby. ",
        "Tammy: Our baby. Your mom stopped by. ",
        "Lizzie: What did she want? ",
        "Tammy: She said she was worried about you. ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, well, then why doesn't she tell granddad to back off? You heard \r\nthe message I left you last night. ",
        "Jonathan: What message? ",
        "Lizzie: The message I left you last night on your voice mail. Oh, my God, \r\nfreakin' service sucks in the basement. ",
        "Tammy: The basement? ",
        "Lizzie: Okay, I followed Hilda, and she led me to the nursery granddad built. \r\nIt was completely stocked with everything I registered for for the baby-- toys, \r\na bed, and everything, and more. ",
        "Jonathan: So, what? ",
        "Lizzie: The more: Bars on the windows. ",
        "Tammy: You mean like prison bars? ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, and surveillance cameras, and like a zillion locks going down \r\nthe door. I told you granddad is up to something. He is going to probably lock \r\nme up there and God knows what will happen after the baby is born. ",
        "Tammy: Are you sure about what you saw? ",
        "Jonathan: That's pretty freaky, even for Alan. ",
        "Lizzie: You don't believe me. Fine, I'll show you. I knew you wouldn't \r\nbelieve me, so I took a picture. I am just going to show it to you, and then you \r\nwill know that I am not making it up. ",
        "Jonathan: All I see is Roxy. Roxy in the park, Roxy with sunglasses on, Roxy \r\nin a ballerina outfit on. ",
        "Lizzie: Okay, it's in here. It has to be. ",
        "",
        "Blake: I'm starving. What do you have here? ",
        "Coop: It's a mushroom and cheese thing. ",
        "Blake: Ooh, this looks good. What's in it? ",
        "Coop: You know what? I better take one first. Just to try it before anyone \r\nelse gets sick. ",
        "Buzz: How do you live with this? ",
        "Ava: It's a trial. If he wasn't rich, I'd be so gone. ",
        "Buzz: Oh, you didn't tell her? ",
        "Coop: I thought you were gonna tell her.",
        "Ava: Tell me what? You're not rich? But you did win a Pulitzer for your last \r\nnovel? ",
        "Coop: I beg you pardon, I won two of them, thank you very much.",
        "Ava: Oh, good. ",
        "",
        "Cassie: I don't believe I have ever seen you at a loss for words, Olivia. ",
        "Olivia: Actually, there is one word that comes to mind: Reva. Last I heard \r\nyou were still married. ",
        "Josh: Reva has been out of the picture lately-- her choice, not mine, as \r\nusual-- and I guess I can say I've made my choice. ",
        "Olivia: Okay. Okay. So how long have you two been... ",
        "Josh: Well, it has been brewing for a little while, I guess. ",
        "Cassie: Yeah, but we didn't even admit it to each other or ourselves until \r\npretty recently. ",
        "Olivia: All right. Well, if this is what makes you happy, more power to you, \r\nI guess. I should get back to my guests. I hope you'll still come to the party.\r\n",
        "Cassie: If you still want us there. ",
        "Olivia: Of course, of course. Please come. I'll see you in a bit. ",
        "Josh: Okay. ",
        "Cassie: I'll be right back. ",
        "Josh: Okay. ",
        "Cassie: Olivia, come on. Don't hold back. Let me have it. ",
        "Olivia: No, Cassie, no. Look, if this is what you want, then it's none of my \r\nbusiness. ",
        "Cassie: But... you're thinking every time Josh and Reva break up, they end up \r\nback together again, right? ",
        "Olivia: That has been my experience. But it will be different for you, I \r\nhope, for your sake-- and for Josh's. You know, Reva\u2019s jerked him around enough. \r\nYou, you deserve a solid guy in your life. I just have one question. ",
        "Cassie: Okay. ",
        "Olivia: How did Reva take it when you told her? ",
        "Cassie: Reva doesn't know-- yet. Like Josh said, she is out of town and this \r\njust kind of snuck up on us. And... we're going to tell her. I mean, we're going \r\nto tell her as soon as we see her. But if you do see her before we do, please, \r\nplease, please don't say anything. I know she's not your favorite person... ",
        "Olivia: I don't want to be the messenger on this one. And if I were you and \r\nJosh, I would tell her via e-mail, phone, smoke signals, some other way than in \r\nperson because it's not going to be pretty. I'll see you later, sweetie. ",
        "",
        "Buzz: Frank! Look who's here. ",
        "Coop: Frank! ",
        "Ava: What can I get you to drink? ",
        "Frank: Nothing right now. ",
        "Buzz: Let me show you the architect's drawings here. We're going to keep the \r\nspirit of the old building, but it is going to be expanded. Olivia is going to \r\ndo that. ",
        "Frank: It looks great, Pop. It looks great. ",
        "Buzz: The architect is here, you want me to introduce you to him. ",
        "Frank: No, no. In a minute. Listen, Pop, can I talk to you for a second, \r\nmaybe in the hallway? ",
        "Buzz: Sure. Coop, you're in charge. What's up? ",
        "Frank: Listen, um, a weird thing happened at the police station last night, \r\nokay? I noticed on one of the police officer's desks, there was a bag-- ",
        "Olivia: Frank. Now the real party can get started. How are things going in \r\nthere? ",
        "Buzz: It's great. You've got your design team in there and two of your \r\ninvestors in there, and you got your nails done? ",
        "Olivia: Yeah, I got my nails done. ",
        "Buzz: They look beautiful. ",
        "Olivia: I bet you say that to all of the girls. ",
        "Buzz: Only beautiful you. You wanted to tell me something? ",
        "Frank: It can wait, Pop. ",
        "Buzz: You sure? ",
        "Frank: Yeah. ",
        "",
        "Josh: That should do it. Thank you so much. I just paid the bill. Do you want \r\nto go to Olivia\u2019s thing? ",
        "Cassie: Sure. ",
        "Josh: Okay. Just out of curiosity, what did you guys talk about? ",
        "Cassie: Oh, nothing you can't imagine, but she did ask one very natural \r\nquestion: How did Reva react when we told her about us? Which then of course I \r\nhad to admit that we haven't told her yet. ",
        "Josh: Yeah, but that's through no fault of our own. She didn't return my \r\nphone calls, and she hasn't come home, and the last time I saw her at the \r\nairport, she walked away from me and... ",
        "Cassie: I know, I know all of that, Josh, but that is not the point. ",
        "Josh: I think that is exactly the point. I think it's the reason that we \r\ndon't owe Reva anything. ",
        "Cassie: We do, Josh. Because telling Reva before anybody else does is the \r\nright thing to do. ",
        "Josh: Maybe Hawk already told her. ",
        "Cassie: I think we would have heard by now. ",
        "Josh: Maybe so. Is this about something else? Is the question that we should \r\ngo back undercover and just pretend like we're friends and associates? ",
        "Cassie: No, I don't know. ",
        "Josh: Is it that we should back away a little bit? Because I think it is a \r\nlittle late for that. ",
        "Cassie: No... I don't know. I just know that I don't feel right about any of \r\nthis right now, and I don't know, I need to think it through or sort it out or \r\nsomething, okay? ",
        "Josh: Okay. We'll take our time. I understand. ",
        "",
        "Billy: Not cold enough? ",
        "Reva: No, it's fine. It's just frustrating. I want to get out of here, but I \r\ncan\u2019t. I want to face Josh and Cassie, but I can\u2019t. ",
        "Billy: Forget about this. You'll drive yourself crazy. ",
        "Reva: What am I supposed to do, Billy, huh? Scoop out my brain and put it in \r\na glass so that I won't think anymore? I just hate this. I do. And I don't even \r\nhave the energy to get upset. ",
        "Billy: You need a change of scene. I'm going to perk you right up. ",
        "Reva: Okay, where we going to go? ",
        "Billy: This is New York City. You and I can get in a lot of trouble if we put \r\nour mind to it. ",
        "Reva: Yeah, we could have done that in the old days. ",
        "Billy: How about I get a car and driver and we do a little nighttime New \r\nYork? We'll run up to Yankee Stadium, I know who's playing, just a couple of \r\ninnings. Maybe a hotdog. Okay, we don't want a hotdog, try going down to Little \r\nItaly. Hey, there's something for everybody in there. ",
        "Reva: I'm not hungry. Is there something we can do besides eat? ",
        "Billy: We can go to a show. Hey, wait a minute. You ever been to the top of \r\nthe Empire State Building. You and I never did that, did we? It sounds like fun, \r\ndoesn't it? ",
        "Reva: Yeah. It sounds great. I'd like to do that. I'd really like to do that.\r\n",

        "Lizzie: No, it has to be on here. A picture that shows the locks on the doors \r\nand the bars on the windows. This... granddad must have erased it. ",
        "Jonathan: When? How did he get your phone? ",
        "Lizzie: Right after I took the picture, I saw him and I confronted him about \r\nthe nursery. We had a struggle, he grabbed my hands, the hand that had the cell \r\nphone in it, and... that's when he must have done it. ",
        "Jonathan: Granddad's spry. ",
        "Lizzie: It's true! You believe me, don't you? ",
        "Tammy: I guess it could have happened like that. ",
        "Lizzie: It did happen like that! ",
        "Tammy: Lizzie, we all know Alan is capable of... ",
        "Jonathan: The point is, Lizzie, that when you get excited, you tend to \r\nexaggerate. ",
        "Lizzie: Hello, he shut down your credit cards, and shut down your business \r\nand had you beaten up. He is on a war path. You guys don't believe me?! ",
        "Tammy: We didn't say that. ",
        "Lizzie: You didn't have to. I thought we were friends. ",
        "Tammy: Calm down. ",

        "Jonathan: Lizzie, chill out. ",
        "Lizzie: No. I can't be here right now. I need to be alone. ",
        "Jonathan: Wait, wait. You're scared that Alan is going to come after you. Why \r\nwould you want to be alone? It doesn't make any sense. ",
        "Lizzie: I don't know, I guess that is just me, right? Silly, crazy, brainless \r\nLizzie who can't take care of herself. Well, guess what? I can and I will. ",

        "Tammy: She's just being paranoid? Could the story really be true? ",

        "Tammy: Alan. Is there any way we can check on that story? ",
        "Jonathan: I guess I can go over and talk to one of the servants. I'll figure \r\nit out. ",
        "Tammy: Maybe I should go get her and bring her back here. ",

        "Jonathan: What kind of episode? ",
        "Billy: She's weak, and she's looking real frail. The cancer is eating away at \r\nher. I guess what I'm saying is just stay close to the phone. I might need to \r\nget hold of you real quick, okay? ",
