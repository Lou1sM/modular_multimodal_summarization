        "Reva: And you've had quite a success story. You started out on a soap opera, right?",
        "Celebrity: Stop tape. I don't discuss that.",
        "Reva: I didn't realize that...",
        "Celebrity: Well, don't your people tell you these things?",
        "Reva: My people. You know what, amber? I don't think we're going to do this. Why don't you take your people and just move on. Excuse me. Is it wrong to wish that someone's microphone would malfunction and electrocute them?",
        "Sandy: Wrong? No. But I was hoping you could get me an autographed picture.",
        "Reva: What? Stop that.",
        "Sandy: So, what's with the fluff piece, anyway?",
        "Reva: I don't know. I guess the station has got some new corporate ownership and they've told us to pump up the sizzle.",
        "Sandy: (Laughs) did they actually use the word \"sizzle\"?",
        "Reva: Yeah. Yeah, they did. I'm supposed to be going for your demographic, kid.",
        "Sandy: Interesting.",
        "Reva: You like that, huh?",
        "Sandy: Well, speaking for my demographic, yeah.",
        "Reva: How would you like to get paid to do that?",
        "Lizzie: My family absolutely adored you tonight. (Laughs happily)",
        "Joey: You really think so?",
        "Lizzie: Uh-uh. I know so. You knocked their socks off, just like you're knocking mine off right now.",
        "Joey: You are so hot, lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I know. And I never get tired of hearing it.",
        "Joey: Hey, tammy.",
        "Tammy: I thought you and lizzie were going to...",
        "Joey: No. I'm right here, with you.",
        "Lizzie: Aunt alex. Oh, I've missed you so much.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, me too, darling. It means the world to me that you came here.",
        "Lizzie: Listen, I don't care what you did. You're still my auntie alex.",
        "Alexandra: (Laughs) yes, well, I appreciate your support, sweetheart. But I'm so ashamed. I mean, this drug business, it'S...",
        "Lizzie: Now, now. We will have none of that, young lady. Do you remember what you told me when I was having trouble? You told me, \"lizzie, you've got to keep your head held high. You're a spaulding.\" And you have to do the same thing.",
        "Alexandra: Yes. All right, darling. Now you can tell me what it is you need and I'll tell you what it is I need.",
        "Olivia: All right. Slingshot enterprises is officially in business.",
        "Bill: It's a big moment.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, it is. I want to celebrate.",
        "Bill: All right. Well, you want to go somewhere fancier?",
        "Olivia: What, like the country club? No. This is nice. It makes it seem more real.",
        "Bill: You like the real, huh?",
        "Olivia: I do.",
        "Bill: Okay. Well, then two menus it is.",
        "Olivia: So, you got any regrets?",
        "Bill: The ink is not even dry yet. What are you asking me that for? All right, listen. Listen. I had my doubts at first, all right? But I think you've proven yourself.",
        "Olivia: You've been testing me?",
        "Bill: Not testing. Just watching, that's all. And the way you kept quiet about my sister, well, that says something.",
        "Olivia: I can be very loyal.",
        "Bill: Loyal is good.",
        "Olivia: I can't wait. We are going to show this town, bill, and I feel sorry for phillip because he's not going to know what hit him.",
        "Phillip: I don't appreciate being summoned like some low- level clerk.",
        "Gus: Actually, alan didn't summon you. I did.",
        "Phillip: Gus! You're back.",
        "Gus: Yes.",
        "Phillip: Good.",
        "Gus: Here I am.",
        "Phillip: Good, good, good, good. I can use you. (Chuckles)",
        "Gus: Really? What, to muscle harley and the cooper family?",
        "Phillip: Oh. Okay. Well, I see alan has filled you in. That's also good. All right, all I'm trying to do is put spaulding back where it belongs, and right now company happens to be in the way. It's a big job and we all need to stand together.",
        "Gus: Hm. Well, I won't be standing with you. Okay? And company is off-limits. Would you tell him, dad?",
        "Phillip: Yes. Tell me, dad.",
        "Frank: You okay, pop?",
        "Buzz: Okay as I can be. You know, part of me wants to bake her a cake with a file in it. The other part of me wants to be on the jury to put her away.",
        "Frank: Yeah. Well, there's not going to be any cake-baking because alexandra is going to pay for what she's done. The spauldings never pay for their mistakes.",
        "Buzz: Well, I don't know. Alan's had a few catch up with him.",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, hopefully alan has one decent bone left in his body and he'll stop his power-crazy son from attacking us.",
        "Buzz: One week and counting until the bulldozers come in and level this place.",
        "Harley: Over my dead body. Or should I say phillip's dead body. And alan'S. And gus'S. Especially gus'S.",
        "Sandy: Are you offering me a j-o-b?",
        "Reva: Well, I have to reach out to people your age. You can help me do that.",
        "Sandy: News flash: I have no tv experience.",
        "Reva: Sandy, I wouldn't be offering you the job if I didn't think you'd be good at it. Besides, I already offered it to michelle santos and she said no.",
        "Sandy: I'm sorry, but so am I.",
        "Reva: You won't have to be in front of the camera, if that's what you're afraid of.",
        "Sandy: That's a plus. So, what exactly would I be doing?",
        "Reva: Well, you'd be ap-ing or pa-ing or whatever it is they call it. Helping. Learning. Giving your creative input. It's a great opportunity, if i do say so myself.",
        "Sandy: Helping, learning. Sounds interesting.",
        "Reva: Is that a yes?",
        "Sandy: No, that's \"I'll think about it.\"",
        "Reva: Okay. Well, while you're thinking about it, could you maybe give me some story ideas that would appeal to young people and to my new boss?",
        "Sandy: Wouldn't that pretty much be me doing the job?",
        "Reva: Can't blame me for trying, can you? Okay, how about this: I'll give you some ideas and you tell me whether they're good or not.",
        "Sandy: Okay. I'll give you a freebie, but just this once.",
        "Reva: Okay, let's see. How's this: A young man's search for his real family?",
        "Tammy: I thought you'd still be with lizzie.",
        "Joey: Nah. I had enough.",
        "Tammy: So how are the wonderful spauldings? They grill you pretty hard?",
        "Joey: Yeah. Can you blame them? I mean, they're looking out for lizzie.",
        "Tammy: So I thought you and lizzie were supposed to do something afterwards.",
        "Joey: Like what?",
        "Tammy: I don't know. Spend some time alone, hang out.",
        "Joey: Why did you think that?",
        "Tammy: No reason.",
        "Joey: I'm not hanging out with lizzie, tammy. So, you out here all by yourself?",
        "Tammy: Just me. I like this place.",
        "Joey: Yeah. Me, too. Do you remember that time that i helped your brothers build that sand castle? Will was so upset when the wave came and washed it all away. Poor kid.",
        "Tammy: You were so sweet offering to build him another one. Next time.",
        "Joey: Next time.",
        "Tammy: And then you drew a big heart with our initials in it.",
        "Joey: Yeah. Tj, right? Stupid, huh? (Laughs)",
        "Tammy: Corny.",
        "Joey: (Laughs) and then that, too, was just washed away.",
        "Tammy: You know, waves don't wash everything away. Like that time we went to the bauers' cabin?",
        "Joey: Yeah. That was a pretty good day, huh?",
        "Tammy: My only regret is that I let you take me to my aunt reva'S.",
        "Joey: Tammy, if I didn't take you to aunt reva's, we would have been...",
        "Tammy: That's why I regret it so much.",
        "Joey: You really mean that?",
        "Tammy: Yeah. Don't you?",
        "Lizzie: Okay, so here's the deal. We all went out for a family dinner so that everybody could get to know joey.",
        "Alexandra: Mm-hmm. All right. How did he hold up?",
        "Lizzie: He was brilliant and everybody loved him.",
        "Alexandra: Good, good. I'm just... I'm sorry I couldn't be there.",
        "Lizzie: Believe me, I am, too. I really could have used you there, aunt alex.",
        "Alexandra: Oh. Well, what happened?",
        "Lizzie: Tammy showed up. You know, everything was going great until she had to poke her nosy little head in the door.",
        "Alexandra: Yes. Well, ex-girlfriends can put a damper on things.",
        "Lizzie: That is exactly what she did. And I know she did it on purpose. She's not this innocent little thing that she wants everybody to think she is.",
        "Alexandra: And is he still hung up on her?",
        "Lizzie: No. No.",
        "Alexandra: Well, do you trust him? Well, then you have nothing to worry about.",
        "Lizzie: Are you sure? I mean, you've dated guys like joey. I mean, is that how they are?",
        "Alexandra: (Laughs nervously)",
        "Lizzie: I'm sorry if it hurt you, me bringing up buzz.",
        "Alexandra: No. No, no. It's perfectly all right, because you're right, dear. Buzz and joey are cut from the same cloth. They're good, solid, straightforward men and we're lucky to know them.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I know. So what do I do?",
        "Alexandra: Run. And don't look back.",
        "Frank: She's back. Welcome home, sis.",
        "Harley: It's good to be home.",
        "Buzz: Let her go. Come here.",
        "Harley: I missed you guys, daddy.",
        "Frank: Well, we missed you, too. Hopefully you had an easier time finding gus than I did with darci.",
        "Harley: Well, same story, practically. I mean, I know he went to chicago, but that's about it.",
        "Buzz: Well, you tried.",
        "Harley: I tried, yeah. I tried. I can't say I tried very hard.",
        "Frank: Well, I can't say i blame you.",
        "Harley: I already know what he's going to say, anyway.",
        "Buzz: No, you don'T.",
        "Harley: Come on, we are fooling ourselves if we think that gus would side with us over the spauldings.",
        "Buzz: You don't know. He loves you. Not that he deserves you, but he loves you.",
        "Harley: Whatever. I'm through with love.",
        "Frank: Oh, boy. Here we go again.",
        "Harley: I guess I can't look to you for support, huh?",
        "Buzz: It is the one thing i still believe in.",
        "Harley: After everything that's happened? After everything with you and alex, with darci and frank, with me and gus? Destruction everywhere you look.",
        "Buzz: It's bad. Take your coffee. We'll get through it.",
        "Harley: Whatever. I'm done with gus.",
        "Frank: Okay. Well, I can live with that.",
        "Harley: And his family is going down.",
        "Buzz: From your lips to...",
        "Harley: It's already happening, dad. Hey, I am done watching the spauldings do damage to every single person I love. I'll stop them myself if I have to, although I would love some help.",
        "Bill: What's the plan, harley? Taking down the spauldings?",
        "Harley: You bet.",
        "Bill: Where do we sign up?",
        "Alan: Phillip, gus's question is, why should a very popular neighborhood restaurant have to go?",
        "Phillip: It's in the way.",
        "Gus: You can't get another piece of land that you need for your project, like, that's actually for sale? You can't do that?",
        "Phillip: Hang on a second, gus. I honestly... I don't understand. Why are you sticking up for those people?",
        "Gus: Excuse me, \"those people\"?",
        "Phillip: Yes, those people. Harley dumped you at your wedding. Buzz and frank helped put your aunt in jail. You don't owe the coopers a thing.",
        "Gus: I lied to the woman i was going to marry. You don't think there's something wrong with that?",
        "Phillip: You lied to protect your family. I think that's honorable.",
        "Alan: I agree with your brother on that one, gus.",
        "Gus: You can... can you pick a side, al? Because you can't just have it both ways, all right?",
        "Phillip: (Laughs) it's kind of fun watching him try, though, isn't it? ( Laughs)",
        "Gus: You're twisted, man.",
        "Phillip: Ah, well, no argument here. Better than being lovesick. Oh, come on, gus. Now, look. You knew I was all for your wedding and you know I'm fond of harley. But take a step back and think about it. She doesn't deserve your loyalty.",
        "Gus: What, and you do?",
        "Phillip: I'm your family.",
        "Gus: Big freaking deal. I trust her. I don't trust you.",
        "Phillip: What have I ever done to you?",
        "Gus: Phillip, at least consider discussing altering your plans for company. I mean, it's to our advantage to have gus's input. He's fair, has a sense of vision...",
        "Phillip: Input is one thing, interference is completely different and I won't tolerate it.",
        "Gus: Let me tell you something. If you're going to crush harley and her family, you're going to have to do that to me, as well. All right?",
        "Alan: Wait a minute. Gus? Gus, where are you going?",
        "Gus: I'm going to go have a little conversation with harley.",
        "Sandy: I know what you're doing here, reva. Shayne's gone, marah's gone. You're trying to make up for it with me. But you can't do... you can't put that on me. You... I shouldn't take the job.",
        "Reva: Do you really think that's what I'm doing? Making you take the place of my other kids?",
        "Sandy: It feels like it. It feels like a lot of pressure.",
        "Reva: Well, not from me. If you're feeling pressure, you're putting it on yourself. So why don't you tell me what the real reason is that you don't want to do this story?",
        "Tammy: Joey, I know you think that I was just using you to get back at my mom.",
        "Joey: Weren't you?",
        "Tammy: Part of me was. But joey, another part of me really wanted to be with you.",
        "Joey: Tammy, I wanted to be with you, too, but not like that. It wasn't right.",
        "Tammy: I was wrong. And selfish. And you were a stand-up guy through all of it. That's one of the things i really loved about you, joey. Love about you.",
        "Joey: Tammy, it wasn't easy being a stand-up guy that day. There was nothing I wanted more in my life than to be with you.",
        "Tammy: I know the feeling.",
        "Joey: Just, some things aren't meant to be.",
        "Tammy: Don't say that.",
        "Joey: Why, tammy?",
        "Tammy: Because I don't think it's true. And you want to know something else? If we hadn't left there that day, I don't think we ever would have broken up. Because we would have shared something that nobody in the whole world could ever take away from us.",
        "Joey: It's too late.",
        "Tammy: It's never too late, joey.",
        "Joey: Tammy...",
        "Tammy: Trust me, joey. It's never too late.",
        "Alexandra: Look, we are spauldings. You and I are spauldings. We are different from other people. We want a different kind of things.",
        "Lizzie: No! No, no, no! I am not different! Okay, I am not like you, okay? I'm not going to end up some frightened, bitter old woman all alone, okay? I'm going to have joey! Aunt alex, I didn't mean that. I'm so sorry. I really didn't mean that.",
        "Alexandra: No, darling. It... it's okay. You're right. The truth is, I am frightened and I suppose bitter. But you know, I'll be hanged if I am too old-- too old-- to learn anything or to teach anything. So, what? You want joey? You shall have joey. Aunt alex will find a way.",
        "Harley: Now, why would you want to take on the spauldings, bill?",
        "Bill: It's a new hobby of mine. It's business, actually. Olivia and I formed a new company, slingshot enterprises.",
        "Buzz: You formed a company to take down the spauldings?",
        "Bill: It's just one of our goals.",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, it's not a bad one.",
        "Olivia: Would you excuse us for just a moment? I just need to speak to phillip privately. Excuse me. What are you doing?",
        "Bill: What are you talking about? I'm being friendly.",
        "Olivia: Come on, you know what I mean.",
        "Bill: What? Harley hates the spauldings just as much as you do. I mean, that makes you two kindred spirits, if not soul sisters.",
        "Olivia: There are a lot of people who have problems with the spauldings. We are not organizing a parade, for god's sake.",
        "Bill: Yes, but no one knows the spauldings better than harley.",
        "Olivia: They know burgers, not business. We do not need them.",
        "Bill: Okay, just a minute ago, didn't you say you liked the real, huh? You're being a little snooty. A little snooty. Folks, listen. Now, I think we've all been shafted by the spauldings one way or another. Am I right?",
        "Harley: Just a little.",
        "Bill: Well, then let's pool our resources, here.",
        "Harley: Strength in numbers, huh?",
        "Bill: That's right. Now, this is up to you. Want to make gus sorry he ever chose to become a spaulding?",
        "Gus: I already am. Coming up on \"guiding light.\"",
        "Harley: You're a spaulding, i am a cooper. We are doomed.",
        "Gus: No.",
        "Harley: Yes.",
        "Alan: I'm going to call security.",
        "Phillip: Oh, no, no, no. Let her huff and puff all she wants. I don't think she's going to blow the house down.",
        "Olivia: You would underestimate me again, but don't say we didn't warn you. Bill clinton, oprah. One on one. Next \"oprah.\"",
        "Frank: Get out of here.",
        "Gus: I just want to talk to yur sister.",
        "Frank: I don't care what you want.",
        "Gus: Is that too much to ask?",
        "Buzz: She's not ready for this.",
        "Gus: Really? Well, I think I should at least hear that from her.",
        "Frank: Really. You would like that, huh?",
        "Gus: Cooper, please.",
        "Buzz: You want to do some good, talk to your brother.",
        "Gus: I've already talked to my brother. I know what's going on. Come on, buzz. I've gone on the record, too, okay? I've gone on the record. I don't want it to happen. Cooper, you believe me, don't you? Come on.",
        "Bill: Gus, maybe, you know, your timing isn't right. Okay?",
        "Gus: Bill, why don't you just stay out of it, okay? Because it really doesn't concern you.",
        "Bill: You two are my friends, all right? I'm concerned.",
        "Olivia: Hey, you know what? We need to go. We stll have some work to do, okay?",
        "Bill: What do you want to do about dinner?",
        "Olivia: Just forget it. We'll do something else. Let's go. Let's go.",
        "Bill: Harley? My offer still stands, all right?",
        "Harley: Thanks, bill.",
        "Buzz: You, too. Why don't you go? We're closing up.",
        "Gus: Please. Just talk to me, okay?",
        "Harley: Five minutes.",
        "Frank: No. You are not going to be giving him five minutes.",
        "Harley: Just... just five minutes.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, so tell me what to do.",
        "Alexandra: All right. The next time you're wrapping your father around your little fingers, I want you to put in a good word for your old, incarcerated, frightened aunt, okay? I know I can help you, so you please convince him to come and see me.",
        "Lizzie: I will try my hardest. Okay, now back to joey.",
        "Alexandra: Yes, of course. Joey. Okay, well, why don't you tell me what are tammy's assets. I mean, what are her selling points?",
        "Lizzie: Does she have any good points?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, come on. Lizzie, if you want to beat your enemy, you have to know their faults, their weaknesses as well as their strengths. Do you want me to help you or not?",
        "Lizzie: Okay, fine. I guess she's fairly-- fairly-- attractive. And sweet. Untouched.",
        "Alexandra: Well, you're all those... you're all those things, aren't you?",
        "Lizzie: Well, I'm at least one. Okay, I'm not sweet. All right, we both know that. And yes, I'm untouched, but for some reason I told tammy i wasn'T.",
        "Alexandra: Why?",
        "Lizzie: I don't know.",
        "Alexandra: Is this really about joey or are you just competing with tammy?",
        "Lizzie: No, no, no. This is definitely about joey, aunt alex. He is the first guy I've ever loved.",
        "Alexandra: Okay. How does your phone come up on caller id?",
        "Lizzie: \"Private.\" Why?",
        "Alexandra: Give me your phone.",
        "Tammy: Joey, I want you. You're all I've ever wanted.",
        "Joey: Why? Why are you saying this to me now?",
        "Tammy: Because it's true.",
        "Joey: Tammy, then why aren't we still together? We didn't break up, tammy, because we didn't sleep together. We broke up because... because i wasn't good enough.",
        "Tammy: Look, joey, I was stupid. But it's not like I've dated a ton of guys. I don't have much experience with this.",
        "Joey: Tammy, I still wasn't good enough.",
        "Tammy: I was wrong. But joey, I want you. (Cell phone rings)",
        "Joey: Oh. Sorry. Hello?",
        "Alexandra: Joey?",
        "Joey: Yeah?",
        "Alexandra: This is alexandra spaulding, lizzie's aunt.",
        "Joey: Who is this really?",
        "Alexandra: Alexandra spaulding. Really.",
        "Joey: (Laughs) sandy, is that you?",
        "Alexandra: Joey, I assure you this is not a prank. I am very worried about my niece. Yes, she came here to the jail to visit me and she left here very, very upset.",
        "Joey: Sucks to be sent up, huh, ms. Spaulding?",
        "Alexandra: Yes, joey, it sucks.",
        "Joey: Hey, you know, my second cousin's dad is doing some time and he's really A...",
        "Alexandra: Just a minute, young man. I want you to listen to me. Now, this is not a joke. Lizzie left here. She's on her way to the beacon and I know she's very upset. Don't believe me, just go there and find out for yourself.",
        "Lizzie: (Laughs quietly)",
        "Joey: Hello? That was really weird?",
        "Tammy: Alexandra spaulding?",
        "Joey: I... I don't even know. Um... (sighs) I've got to go.",
        "Tammy: Right. Say hi to lizzie for me.",
        "Sandy: This is exactly why we shouldn't work together. A little disagreement becomes a big argument, so that's why I'm talking off.",
        "Reva: No. I still have a problem with my new boss.",
        "Sandy: Not my problem, lady.",
        "Reva: Oh, come on.",
        "Sandy: (Laughs)",
        "Reva: Look, brat, I need your help and I need your advice. You can't just say no without giving me a good reason.",
        "Sandy: Okay, I gave you a very good reason. And as for my advice, you wouldn't take it?",
        "Reva: I beg your pardon.",
        "Sandy: Yeah, you-- you, reva- - are like a steamroller. Anyone ever tell you that?",
        "Reva: Never! Well, once or twice. But okay, okay, I admit it, i do. I miss my kids. And I should be happy that they're out there making their own lives, making themselves happy, saving the world, making it a better place. But screw the world. I miss them. I miss the little buggers. And if I'm latching on to you, then you're just going to have to deal with that, because we're mothers. I'm a mother. And mothers latch. They smother, they cling, they bother and sometimes they do it all at once.",
        "Sandy: Are you done?",
        "Reva: No. You avoided all of this for the first two decades of your life and I feel like I have to make up for it. But along with the latching and the smothering are a few other things that come with the deal.",
        "Sandy: Like?",
        "Reva: Like love. Like support.",
        "Sandy: You're not going to take no for an answer, are you?",
        "Reva: Nope.",
        "Alan: Spaulding. I have the spaulding job and it's my punishment for tapping into the computer. He's never going to let me go.",
        "Reva: You just let me handle alan spaulding, okay?",
        "Phillip: And peter burns is interested in coming on board as well, provided we can keep his name out of it.",
        "Olivia: Hello, gentlemen.",
        "Bill: Gentlemen?",
        "Olivia: My mistake.",
        "Alan: Um, olivia, you can't just walk in here like that.",
        "Bill: We're stockholders, alan. Show a little respect, huh?",
        "Olivia: We heard about your latest endeavor, phillip-- taking over company? You really should know how difficult it is to get the smell of grease out of your hair.",
        "Bill: Can I get some phillip fries with my buzz burger? I mean, please.",
        "Alan: In case you two haven't noticed, we're running a business here.",
        "Bill: And so are we.",
        "Alan: Slingshot enterprises.",
        "Bill: Mm-hmm.",
        "Alan: (Chuckles) sounds like some kind of a hillbilly company or something.",
        "Bill: (Laughs) said goliath to david, and look what happened to him.",
        "Gus: I'm sorry.",
        "Harley: For what you did to me or what phillip is doing to my family?",
        "Gus: Both.",
        "Harley: Well, you can only fix one. Will you?",
        "Gus: I am going to try.",
        "Harley: Thank you. How?",
        "Gus: Well, for one thing, I've got to go back to the company and work for the family.",
        "Harley: You're going to work for alan again?",
        "Gus: You just asked me to help, right? Well, how else am I supposed to do it?",
        "Harley: I don't know. I don't know.",
        "Gus: There's only one way to do it and that's from the inside.",
        "Harley: You're already there. You proved that.",
        "Gus: You know, when you were out of town, I went to our... i went to your house. I was looking for you and you weren't there.",
        "Harley: No, I wasn't there. I wasn't there because I was looking for you.",
        "Alan: I'm going to call security.",
        "Phillip: Oh, no, no, no, no. Let her huff and puff all she wants. I don't think she's going to blow the house down.",
        "Olivia: You would underestimate me again, but don't say we didn't warn you.",
        "Phillip: I thought that your only objective in bedding young bill here was to attach yourself to a free lewis, as you've now run out of spauldings.",
        "Bill: Well, phillip, we're business partners now.",
        "Phillip: Yeah. You have to excuse me, bill. I've known olivia a lot longer than you have. I happen to know that her real talent does not lie in the boardroom.",
        "Bill: Well, tell me: Who kept this ship afloat while you were over at ravenwood eating soup through a straw?",
        "Phillip: Go back to your sandbox, bill. And take your slut of a nanny here with you.",
        "Olivia: Ooh.",
        "Bill: Okay, why don't you watch your mouth there, big guy? All right?",
        "Olivia: Stop it. It doesn't bother me. Leave it alone. The way I see it...",
        "Phillip: Or what?",
        "Olivia: ...Spaulding only has one way to go and that's down.",
        "Bill: Mm-hmm. There. A little promotional tool for you. And remember, it took david just one rock.",
        "Alan: Once a climber, always a climber.",
        "Phillip: Oh, she's predictable, all right.",
        "Alan: You know, I do pity bill.",
        "Phillip: Oh, I wouldn'T. They're perfectly positioned.",
        "Alan: You want them together?",
        "Phillip: Oh, yes. Absolutely. Right up until the final move of the game.",
        "Sandy: Mind if I join you?",
        "Tammy: If you don't mind sitting in silence.",
        "Sandy: No problem.",
        "Tammy: (Sighs) so, is it true that guys like girls who give it up?",
        "Sandy: Whoa, that... uh, that was blunt.",
        "Tammy: Well, do they.",
        "Sandy: Yeah. Wait, why are you asking? I may need to change my answer.",
        "Tammy: No, can't change it. It's too late now.",
        "Sandy: Is it about joey?",
        "Tammy: Who else?",
        "Sandy: Well, joey is a good guy. I highly doubt he's looking for some skank to bring home to his mom.",
        "Tammy: Even if that skank is lizzie?",
        "Sandy: Uh, oh. Okay. Well, first of all, lizzie is not a skank. Second of all, her and joey aren't even together.",
        "Tammy: Well, he just left here to go and meet her at the beacon. And she made it very clear that she's more than ready.",
        "Sandy: Oh. Sorry. Well, whether or not that's true, there's got to be another reason they're together.",
        "Tammy: Like what?",
        "Sandy: Like maybe joey makes her feel good about herself.",
        "Tammy: Or she makes him feel good about himself.",
        "Joey: Lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: What are you doing here? I thought you had to work.",
        "Joey: Yeah, I did. I came here. You okay?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah.",
        "Joey: Lizzie, you don't have to pretend. Your aunt called me.",
        "Lizzie: She did?",
        "Joey: At least that's what I'm beginning to think now.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I went to go visit her in jail and I tried calling you but you didn't answer.",
        "Joey: Calling me? No, I don't have any missed calls.",
        "Lizzie: I wish you didn't have to see me like this, joey.",
        "Joey: Lizzie, it's okay.",
        "Lizzie: Now it is.",
        "Gus: You were looking for me, too? Because of the thing that's happening with company, or...?",
        "Harley: It was before I knew about that.",
        "Gus: So why were you looking for me?",
        "Harley: I missed your ugly face, okay?",
        "Gus: It's been a while since you've called me ugly. It's nice.",
        "Harley: So why were you looking for me?",
        "Gus: I missed the kids. And you. I missed the smell of your hair. Maybe it's the shampoo you use, I don't know.",
        "Harley: I threw out the rest of your stuff. Well, except for one shirt, because it smelled like you.",
        "Gus: We got the smell thing going. What's that all about?",
        "Harley: Yeah. What does that say about us?",
        "Gus: Maybe it's saying that what we had is real and human. You're still wearing the ring.",
        "Harley: What are we doing here? You're a spaulding, I am a cooper. We are doomed.",
        "Gus: No.",
        "Harley: Yes.",
        "Olivia: It was nice of you to defend me to phillip like that.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, it's what partners do.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, I know. I'm just... I'm used to defending myself.",
        "Bill: I got your back from now on.",
        "Olivia: I guess I'll have to get used to that.",
        "Bill: And you realize this is just the beginning? I mean, wait until we sic harley on phillip, huh?",
        "Olivia: I'm not convinced of that, you know? Did you see the way harley looked at gus? Do we really want that kind of complication?",
        "Bill: Don't, don't worry about a thing. Gus and harley are over. The coopers are tough as nails. I mean, at least they're on our side, right?",
        "Olivia: I don't know. I just... besides, after the way you stood up to phillip, I don't think we need anyone else.",
        "Phillip: Done. Sandy is officially excused from the internship program.",
        "Reva: Oh, good. I knew I ran into the right spaulding. Alan would have fought me.",
        "Phillip: Oh, alan can be difficult sometimes. But that's okay. You just have to know how to handle him.",
        "Reva: (Laughs) and we both know how to do that.",
        "Phillip: That's right, we do. Listen, while I'm doing you a favor, maybe you can do me one.",
        "Reva: Sure.",
        "Phillip: I understand that you're doing a story about some restaurant that's closing down.",
        "Reva: It's company, phillip.",
        "Phillip: (Laughs) I'm sure I have your angle on this. I'm sure it's a great human interest thing, big business versus the little guy.",
        "Reva: That's exactly what it is. But I promise I'll be fair.",
        "Phillip: Yeah. Um, I want you to kill it.",
        "Reva: Kill it? Why?",
        "Phillip: Because I'm asking you to. Or actually, I'm telling you.",
        "Reva: (Laughs) excuse me?",
        "Phillip: I'm your new boss. Yeah, I bought the station.",
        "Joey: Do you want me to get you something to drink?",
        "Lizzie: Uh, okay.",
        "Joey: Any preference?",
        "Lizzie: No, uh-uh.",
        "Joey: Okay.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, you know what? Lemonade. Thanks.",
        "Joey: Lemonade.",
        "Lizzie: Fresh.",
        "Joey: Fresh lemonade.",
        "Lizzie: Thank you, aunt alex. (Cell phone ringing) tammy. (Sighs)",
        "Tammy: Hey, it's me. I wish you had stayed earlier because I wanted to tell you again how much you mean to me. Joey, I... I love you. And I really hope you believe that. Anyway, I keep thinking about the cabin, and I still hope that we can finish what we started there. Think about it.",
        "Lizzie: I'll bet I can access his voice mail. Let's see, what's the password. Hm, let's see. T-a-m-m-Y. Well, we're going to have to change that one. (Laughs) go back up to the cabin? I don't think so.",
        "Joey: Here you go.",
        "Lizzie: Thanks.",
        "Joey: Lizzie? Hello? Hey. Don't start on that again, please.",
        "Lizzie: Joey, I just wish i could get away from all this sadness and go somewhere where it can just be me and you.",
        "Gus: Well, we haven't kissed like that...",
        "Gus and harley: ...In a long time.",
        "Gus: Are we crazy?",
        "Harley: I don't know. Are we crazy? Or is this us getting back together? Next, on \"guiding light.\"",
        "Harley: If there is even a chance of us being together again, certain things have to happen.",
        "Michelle: We're going to have to deal with something that's been brewing for a long time now.",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Michelle: Going our separate ways."
