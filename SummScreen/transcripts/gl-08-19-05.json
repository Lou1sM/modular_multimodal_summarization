        "Mallet: Yeah, Phillip Spaulding. Yeah, that's right, the guy that was killed. Well, supposedly, anyway. Listen, I just wanted to send the photo over and see if anything turns up, okay? Okay. Yeah, no, that's great. Thanks. Come on. Hello? Hello? Hey! Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Phillip?",

        "Song: Only you can make this world seem right only you can make the darkness bright only you and you alone can thrill me like you do and fill my heart with love for only you...",

        "Lizzie: Are we late? Have they started it yet?",
        "Rick: No. It's just the beginning, actually.",
        "Lizzie: What's wrong? You look like you lost your best friend. It's a wedding. You should smile.",

        "Lizzie: How much do you spend on a wedding gift?",
        "Alexandra: Well, around $1,000, but look, I'm sure Gus and Harley don't expect you to be that extravagant. And you know, considering your situation right now...",
        "Lizzie: My situation? Oh, that my family cut me off and I just don't have any money to my name.",
        "Alexandra: Look, if you want to, go down to Egan's, you charge something for Gus and Harley. Just put it on my account. Come on.",
        "Lizzie: No, I can't do that. It's not right. I'll figure it out. I'll take care of it myself.",

        "Beth: Did you see him?",
        "Rick: I saw him, yes. Did you think that...",

        "Gus: I was ready a year ago.",
        "Zach: It should have been a year ago.",
        "Harley: Here, come sit with Grandpa.",
        "Rick: Dearly beloved, family and friends of Harley Cooper and Gus Aitoro, welcome to their wedding. These two people are shining examples of what it is to hang on to hope in the face of incredible adversity. And during all your travails and challenges, your love did nothing but get stronger. And as Shakespeare put it, \"Star-crossed, tempest-tossed.\" Yet here you are, together, in front of God, and in front of your family and friends, stronger than ever. I'm confident that I speak for all who love you when I say that it is a privilege to be here with you today, for it is a joy to witness the beginning of a new and wonderful, and hopefully less eventful, chapter in your lives together.",
        "Ross: The good book tells us that we should not enter into marriage lightly, and you have taken that advice to heart. You have not entered into this commitment without a great deal of thought, so much so that you have written your own vows. And now the moment for that has arrived. Harley, would you begin?",
        "Harley: I think you'll like them much more this time. Gus, are we really here? I would ask you to pinch me, but if it's a dream, I don't want to wake up. I want to stay in this dream forever because it almost didn't happen. You made a mistake, and then I made one, too, and I couldn't forgive you because I became afraid. I was afraid because I still loved you with all my heart. And in the past love has hurt me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: What am I going to do, Harley?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: I'm not afraid anymore...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: How am I going to tell you that Phillip's still out there?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: ...Because I am ready to spend the rest of my life with the most wonderful man in the world. I love the way you look at me, like right now, like there's nobody else in this room. We've been together a long time, and still when you look at me like that, my heart... thank you, for opening your heart to me and my children. Thank you for loving my children. That is the sign of a real man. I couldn't love anybody the way I love you. You kept me calm when I was frightened and alone, and so now, here in front of God and all these beautiful and handsome people, I, Harley Cooper, promise you, Gus Aitoro, that I will love you more and more with every passing day, through the joy and adversity that life throws our way. I will support you and encourage you and believe in you the way that you have believed in me for the rest of our lives.",
        "Zach: Yay! ( Laughter )",
        "Ross: Gus?",
        "Harley: You're up.",
        "Gus: Well, you make it sound like a big deal that I stuck by your side this whole past year, and the truth of the matter is I didn't really have a choice. You're it. You're it for me, end of story. That smile-- I mean, how could that not hook a guy forever, and just never let him go? And then you introduced your crazy family into the picture-- sorry Frank-- and your kids. I also know that everything good that has happened to me is because of you, and anything bad is just part of the price that had to be paid to be able to be here right now at this moment so that I could say to you in front of God and all these... these people and witnesses that I want to thank you, because I feel blessed and I feel honored that you said yes and that you would be mine. And I promise you that I will love you each and every single day, no matter what joy or adversity is thrown our way.",
        "Harley: Yes.",
        "Gus: That I will encourage you and I will love you and I will support you and I'll believe in you just the way that you believed in me, every single day. And I will take care of you and our children. But most importantly, I'm just going... going to be grateful for you every day for the rest of our lives. Okay.",
        "Zach: Yay! ( Laughter )",
        "Gus: You're going to Boarding School. ( Laughter )",
        "Ross: Now that Harley and Gus have exchanged their vows, it is time for me to make a completely rhetorical statement. If there by anyone who has reason to object to this union, speak now or forever hold your peace.",
        "Ross: Speak now or forever hold your peace. Going once, going twice, no takers, just as I thought. Now, then, at this point we need the rings. Harley?",
        "Harley: With this ring I thee wed, and with all that I am and all that I have, I pledge myself to you for the rest of our lives.",
        "Gus: And with this ring, I thee wed, with all that I am and all that I have, for the rest of our lives.",
        "Ross: Harley and Gus, you have pledged your eternal love to one another, and you have done so before God and before your family and friends. You have exchanged rings symbolizing that eternal love, and that has brought us to this moment. Therefore by the power vested in my by the City of Springfield, I now pronounce you husband and wife. ( Applause ) Gus, you may now kiss your lovely bride.",
        "( Applause )",
        "Harley: Okay, enough of that, enough of that, enough of that.",
        "Buzz: Congratulations.",
        "Harley: Thanks.",
        "Gus: All right, pick it up.",
        "Harley: Okay, of course.",
        "Gus: Oh, come on! Thank you very much.",
        "Harley: Okay, stay with Grandpa for one second.",
        "Gus: There. Isn't that better?",
        "Harley: Much.",
        "Gus: Well, I guess we know what Rick said, right?",
        "Harley: Yes. Phillip was in the casket, so he's dead. End of story. I'm just sorry for Rick.",
        "Gus: I know. I wish it could have been easier, but that's the way it had to be. At least now we can go onwards and upwards, and we don't have to look back.",
        "Harley: Yeah. I guess Zach really has lost his daddy, though.",
        "Gus: Yeah, but he gained a stepdad.",
        "Harley: Yes, the best any kid could ask for.",

        "Marina: Well, if I am, you know why?",
        "Danny: Why?",
        "Marina: Because you make me so happy.",
        "Danny: Oh, really? Yeah? Is that why you disappeared on me before? I turned around and you were gone, and no one knew where you went.",
        "Marina: I had something to take care of.",
        "Danny: Oh, what? Some bridesmaidsy thing?",
        "Marina: No. Actually, I went to go talk to Michelle.",

        "Jeffrey: Oh, sorry. Sorry. Oh. Yeah. Oh. Mmm. Mmm. Wow. Not that I'm complaining, but what was that for?",
        "Cassie: That was a sendoff.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, a sendoff. Where am I going?",
        "Cassie: You're going to go set up the band so you can play music, because I would love to dance.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you know, there's recorded music. You can dance to recorded music.",
        "Cassie: You're so not getting out of this.",
        "Jeffrey: You're right. I'm not. But it's not me. It's the guys, you know, in the band. They've got a problem with it.",
        "Cassie: They don't do weddings?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. They feel like they're selling out.",
        "Cassie: They're not selling out. They're doing a good deed for a good friend. No big deal.",
        "Jeffrey: I know. That's what I keep telling them, but they keep telling me that they need something more, you know, like a quid pro quo.",
        "Cassie: Okay, whatever, whatever. Give them whatever they want, whatever's going to make them happy. Fine.",
        "Jeffrey: They want you to sing backup.",
        "Cassie: I can't sing. You know that.",
        "Jeffrey: You're really not that bad.",
        "Cassie: This is cruel and unusual punishment.",

        "Mallet: Cheers.",
        "Gus: Yeah, yeah. Of course we're glad you came. Of course.",
        "Harley: And we kind of have good news. I mean, sort of good news. Phillip's body was exhumed today, and he was in the casket. So he's dead.",
        "Mallet: Wow. Really?",
        "Harley: Yeah. Rick was the one who did the exhumation.",
        "Mallet: Uh...",
        "Harley: He was there.",
        "Mallet: Rick, huh?",
        "Harley: Mm-hmm.",
        "Mallet: Well, that would the guy that would know, so that's great. That's great news.",

        "Frank: Hey, Pop, what the hell are you doing? You're missing all the fun.",
        "Buzz: I'm changing the battery.",
        "Frank: You paid a video guy to do this. Come on, come on.",
        "Buzz: I know, I know. They're good, but they're dry. I have more pizzazz.",
        "Frank: Dad, if you don't come out now you're going to miss everything. Now come on.",
        "Buzz: Okay.",
        "Alexandra: Well, I'm so happy for Harley, I really am. And you certainly are the proud father.",
        "Buzz: I am that.",
        "Alexandra: Well, I'm grateful that Harley and Gus even invited me, you know? And it was a lovely wedding. It was. I mean, they got married, I'm not in cuffs. Yeah. Well, enjoy yourself, and congratulations.",
        "Buzz: Al? I know you signed the papers committing Alan, and I'm sure you're wondering whether he was telling the truth. Gus had the casket exhumed. Rick ID'd it. It's Phillip's body.",
        "Alexandra: Well, I'm glad you're the one to tell me. I mean, I couldn't help wonder, of course. I mean, Alan was so sure. I mean, I couldn't help wishing Phillip...",
        "Buzz: I know. Alan's lost it.",
        "Alexandra: Uh-huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Russo, I just read a little article in the paper. Good work. I have something else I want you to do. I want you to stake out men at the airport, the bus station, and the train station, because I think when Phillip reads this, he will be coming home, and I want to be ready.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Lizzie, Lizzie, I know that we're having problems, but we could at least talk.",
        "Lizzie: About what?",
        "Beth: How are you?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, I'm doing great. I have no money. You took it away from me. I'm probably the only person here who couldn't afford a wedding gift.",
        "Beth: Well, you know, there is a solution to that. You could move back home, where you belong.",
        "Lizzie: What happened to being independent and responsible? You really do have problems.",
        "Beth: Be careful what you walk away from, Lizzie. It might not still be there when you realize you need it.",
        "Lizzie: What are you talking about?",
        "Beth: I just mean that Gus is in charge of things now. There's no telling what he'll do with the company, let alone the family.",
        "Lizzie: Well, I trust Gus.",
        "Beth: Really? The same man who tore you apart on the witness stand? Be careful, sweetie. Gus is out for Gus.",
        "Lizzie: Well, I don't care if he wants Spaulding.",
        "Beth: Don't you say that. This company is your father's legacy, and if Gus runs it into the ground, there goes your future.",
        "Lizzie: What future? My money? You already took that away from me.",
        "Beth: Lizzie, don't do this. You're making a mistake.",
        "Lizzie: Well, I really don't think so. But if I am, hey, it runs in the family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Here's to Mrs. Aitoro.",
        "Harley: Did I mention I'm not changing my name?",
        "Gus: Well, as long as you keep that ring on your finger.",
        "Harley: Oh, it's never coming off.",
        "Gus: That's why I used superglue.",
        "Harley: Very sneaky.",
        "Gus: Oh, I'm not stupid. I'm not taking any chances. Hello. How are you? I love you.",
        "Harley: I love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: All right, stop. Stop. Why did you go see Michelle?",
        "Marina: I thought her phone call about Robbie and the misunderstanding about the insurance information was weird. It seemed kind of like an excuse.",
        "Danny: For what?",
        "Marina: I don't know. Maybe just to talk to you, see if what I said about you moving on was true or not. And I wanted her to know that it was.",
        "Danny: Well, I think you made that very clear earlier over your phone call.",
        "Marina: Yes, and guess what? She got the point. In fact, she says that she's moving on, too, and she wants us to be very happy.",
        "Danny: Well, good.",
        "Marina: So I invited her here. What?",
        "Danny: You. You are a stone-cold freak.",

        "Lizzie: What are all those envelopes about?",
        "Coop: Greek wedding. The Italians do it, too.",
        "Lizzie: They do... they do what?",
        "Coop: Well, they give cash to the newlyweds.",
        "Lizzie: You mean to tell me those things are filled with money?",
        "Coop: By the looks of it, I think Gus and Harley are going to make out pretty well.",
        "Frank: Hey, Coop? Excuse me. I need you for one second, okay, man?",
        "Coop: Yeah, sure. Go on. I'll be right back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Ladies and gentlemen, little critters, let me have your attention here. I want to welcome you to this event, this event that...",
        "Coop: That we never thought would happen?",
        "Buzz: Speak for yourself, Bradshaw. ( Laughter ) Gus and Harley-- would you please? Gus and Harley worked long and hard to find their way back to each other and we're glad they found their way to us. And I am over the moon that my beautiful and amazing daughter found a guy that knows how lucky he is to have her.",
        "Frank: Here, here.",
        "Buzz: Okay, so let's crank up the music. Gus?",
        "Gus: Yes, crank it up.",
        "Buzz: You have to dance with your wife. Music! Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Mr. and Mrs. Gus Aitoro. ( Cheers and applause )",

        "Mallet: Great party, hey, Rick?",
        "Rick: Yeah, great party.",
        "Mallet: Yeah. I'm sorry you had to start your day off on such a different note. Harley told me what you were up to this morning. Boy, that couldn't have been an easy thing to do.",
        "Rick: No, it wasn't, but it comes with the territory.",
        "Mallet: Yeah. What... what territory is that?",
        "Rick: Being a Medical Examiner.",
        "Mallet: Hm.",
        "Rick: The job is full of very unpleasant duties.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, boy, I guess you got to do what you've got to do, huh?",
        "Rick: Well, you're a cop. You know the deal, right?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I'm a cop. I'm beginning to wonder how good of a cop I actually am. I was following what I thought were some pretty good leads on Phillip, actually starting to think he was maybe alive. Now you tell me he's dead...",
        "Rick: Phillip's dead. I saw him in the casket.",
        "Mallet: Well, you can't doubt a statement like that. You know, I was curious. What's the procedure with an exhumation? Do they have someone there who helps you witness it?",
        "Rick: Sure.",
        "Mallet: Like an assistant or something?",
        "Rick: Yeah, sometimes.",
        "Mallet: Yeah. What about this time?",
        "Rick: Well, this time I was alone, but if you wanted to join me, you were more than welcome to ask me. But... oh, that's right. I'm sorry, that's... you didn't know until after the fact, right? It's interesting. I guess Harley didn't feel compelled to share that information with you, just me and Gus. Her friends.",
        "Mallet: You think she's safe now?",
        "Rick: I know she's safe. And I also know my friend's in a better place.",
        "Mallet: Where would that be?",
        "Rick: Now it's time for us just to move forward. Right?",
        "Mallet: You sure about that, Rick?",
        "Rick: Positive.",

        "Alan: Beth. I thought you would be at the wedding.",
        "Beth: I was. But I thought my time could be better spent here with you getting a few things straight.",
        "Alan: Well, sure. Like what?",
        "Beth: I told my mother about your proposal.",
        "Alan: ( Chuckles ) I'm sure Lillian was thrilled, huh?",
        "Beth: She thinks you're using me. But I said \"No, Alan doesn't see me that way. He has too much respect for me.\"",
        "Alan: You're absolutely right.",
        "Beth: But we both know we're using each other. I've learned a thing or two living under the same roof as you, Alan. Among other things, I've learned to like myself. I know who I am and what I have to offer, and if and when I do marry again, trust me, it will be a 50-50 partnership, sometimes even 60-40 in my favor. I will not suppress my needs or my identity for any man ever again.",
        "Alan: Good for you.",
        "Beth: What do you think Gus plans to do with the company? I've heard some rumors, none of them good.",
        "Alan: Yes, I've heard the same rumors.",
        "Beth: This family, this company, was everything to Phillip. And Gus just waltzes in and starts giving Lizzie advice, dangerous advice. He thinks that he can make major decisions that will affect each and every one of us for years to come.",
        "Alan: You have the power to stop it, if you want to.",
        "Beth: Oh, I know that. In fact, I'm already one step ahead of you.",
        "Beth: So, about your proposal, Alan. I accept. I can't wait to become Mrs. Alan Spaulding. So let's get married right now.",
