        "Olivia: I know you're the one behind that web site. And you planted those photos on me, and I'll prove it.",
        "Buzz: Honey, what are you doing?",
        "Olivia: There's got to be something on that site that points to her.",
        "Ava: Oh, yeah? Go ahead, keep on lying. You're digging yourself deeper and deeper and deeper. We'd really love to watch you.",
        "Olivia: She must have left her mark here somewhere. All right, it's loading.",
        "Buzz: What is it? What's wrong? What does that mean? Whoa.",
        "Coop: Whoa.",
        "Buzz: Go get the ice. Go get some-- there's a towel over there.",
        "Ava: Um... what does this really mean?",
        "Buzz: You fainted. You saw the web page and you passed out.",
        "Ava: Okay, um... it said something about Labor Day and family or something.",
        "Olivia: I just forgot to eat. I'm okay.",

        "Olivia: You planted those photos on me.",
        "Coop: Oh, you are so unbelievable. She didn't put the photos in the bag-- in your bag, Olivia, all right? She has nothing to do with this stupid, little web site.",
        "Buzz: She doesn't know anything about the web site, okay? Will you give her some air? Thank you. Take it easy; don't sit up too fast.",
        "Olivia: Thanks. I'm okay, sorry.",
        "Buzz: You are?",
        "Olivia: Uh-huh.",
        "Buzz: Well, good because I think they bought the no-eating bit. Now what is that web page all about?",

        "Lizzie: (Whispers) Roxy? Roxie? Come here, girl. Where are you? Roxie. (Door opens) (gasps) Jonathan. Thank God you guys came back. Jonathan? Tammy? Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh my God, oh my God. Who's there? Stop! Stop! (Gun stop) (screams)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: What was that?",
        "Jonathan: Nothing. Unlike what's going on between you two.",
        "Josh: I do not need your approval to see Cassie.",
        "Jonathan: You have a wife. Do you remember Reva? And you are her sister. That is just as bad.",
        "Josh: Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: No. No, Josh. You would not be doing this to her if you knew what was going on with her.",
        "Josh: What's going on with her then?",

        "Jonathan: Lizzie, what happened?",
        "Lizzie: I... I killed him.",
        "Jonathan: Come here. Hey, are you okay? Did he hurt you?",

        "Lizzie: Oh, it's too late.",
        "Jonathan: Hey. Why was Alan here? Why did he have a gun?",
        "Lizzie: It was my gun. I got it from Alan-Michael to protect the baby. I didn't fee safe.",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie, what did you do?",
        "Lizzie: I don't know. It was really dark in here and someone came in. I thought it was you, but they kept opening the door and he wouldn't answer me. I had no other choice.",
        "Josh: His heart's beating. He's alive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Look, I wasn't covering. I didn't faint because of that web site. I don't even know what it means. Buzz: It was about you. The picture was of you. Do you know what the words meant?",
        "Olivia: I was so angry with Ava, I got lightheaded, that's all.",
        "Buzz: Okay. It's good enough for me.",
        "Coop: All she has to do is just give him these little puppy dog eyes, and all of a sudden, his common sense goes right out the damn window. You know what? I still think she is the person behind this whole web site thing.",
        "Buzz: I think it's time to wrap this up, okay?",
        "Coop: Dad, do you believe her?",

        "Buzz: Don't even think of apologizing.",
        "Olivia: I hate what this is doing to you.",
        "Buzz: Oh, come on. We'll get past this. Everyone's just paranoid about this web site. First, Frank accuses you. And then you accuse Ava, and it starts snowballing, and everybody gets upset, but Coop and Ava will get over it. What's with this thing, how do you turn it off?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Is he still breathing?",
        "Josh: Yeah, I can't find a wound.",
        "Jonathan: Where's the blood?",
        "Josh: Lizzie, where did you shoot him?",
        "Lizzie: He was coming towards the bed.",
        "Josh: No, I mean where was he hit.",

        "Jonathan: Good move.",
        "Lizzie: What if someone had come after me and the baby?",
        "Cassie: Lizzie, he did you a favor, let alone Alan.",
        "Alan: You shot me, Elizabeth.",
        "Lizzie: I didn't know that it was you, okay? You scared me. Why didn't you answer me? Why did you come here in the dark? Why?!",
        "Alan: I wanted to give you this.",
        "Lizzie: A check?",
        "Alan: I thought that would make things right between us. I mean, everything's been spinning out of control lately.",
        "Lizzie: I got this thing because I thought I needed it. Because I am afraid of you.",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie, just give that back.",
        "Lizzie: No. No. You know something? This is safe. The gun is safe, but I'm not. Because he was having me followed. He wants to have me and the baby locked up, he does. Tell them. Tell them!",
        "Security guard: Beacon security, drop your weapon.",
        "Jonathan: Easy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Oh, there you are. Hello. So, nothing's wrong. You're just a little light- headed.",
        "Olivia: I just wanted to be alone.",
        "Buzz: Well, we could use our words, couldn't we? We could just say, \"Buzz, I want to be alone.\"",
        "Olivia: I thought if I said that, you would worry about me and come after me.",
        "Buzz: What was I supposed to do, hang around in the hotel room, raid the mini bar, watch TV? When somebody leaves like that, they're begging to be followed.",
        "Olivia: Not this person.",
        "Buzz: Come on. I mean, something's going on. You've got to tell me what it is.",
        "Olivia: What about my privacy?",
        "Buzz: What about us?",
        "Olivia: \"Us\" is very new.",
        "Buzz: We took a lot of risks to get here. If you're not going to let me in, then what's the point?",
        "Olivia: You can't help me this time. I did something.",
        "Buzz: I'll understand.",
        "Olivia: How can you say that when you don't know what it is?",
        "Buzz: Because when it comes to making mistakes, I'm one of the few guys in town that'll give you a run for your money.",
        "Olivia: That's really comforting.",
        "Buzz: I walked out on my family.",
        "Olivia: You came back.",
        "Buzz: After 20 years. I walked out on my pregnant wife and my seven-year-old son. You can't do much worse than that.",
        "Olivia: I killed my own mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: And another thing, you know, it's like she has him brainwashed or something. I mean, why can't dad see what we see, you know? It's... (moans) Okay. Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry about the whole thing. I hate that we keep bringing this up.",
        "Ava: You don't have to be sorry, okay? There's no one who hates Olivia more than I do. You're fine.",
        "Coop: What about Frank?",
        "Ava: Frank is Frank. He doesn't hate her.",
        "Coop: Yeah, exactly. Ava, don't you see? It's like all we do is talk about her. That's it. It's always Olivia, back and forth.",
        "Ava: Okay. Um... ha! You know what, I've got a great idea. Why don't we find out where Buzz keeps his premium liquor, and I'll whip us up a couple of cocktails? We'll forget all about Olivia.",
        "Coop: (Laughs) Wait, wait, wait. Turn Olivia into a drinking game now?",
        "Ava: Yeah, why not?",
        "Coop: Are you serious?",
        "Ava: I'm serious. And either one of us who mentions her name has to take a drink. We'll have lots of stuff to talk about, right? Or maybe we don't have to talk at all.",
        "Coop: Oh, uh-huh. Yeah, I uh...",
        "Ava: You like that?",
        "Coop: I like that game. I really like that game. Tell you what, I'll start checking the cabinets.",
        "Ava: Okay.",
        "Coop: Grab your stuff, we can...",
        "Ava: I'll grab the glasses.",
        "Coop: Okay, that sounds good.",
        "Alan-Michael: Bottoms up.",
        "Ava: (Laughing) I am going to ignore you.",
        "Alan-Michael: I was just teasing.",
        "Ava: You're lucky you're rich, Alan-Michael. It takes the heat off your personality.",
        "Alan-Michael: You don't think I could get by on my charm and good looks?",
        "Ava: It depends on the girl.",
        "Alan-Michael: Is that any way to talk to a guy who pulled you out of a fire?",
        "Ava: I knew you were going to use that card on me.",
        "Alan-Michael: It's all I got Ava. You won't work with me, so I'm left aimless and heartbroken.",
        "Ava: (Sighs) Cry me a river.",
        "Alan-Michael: The files keep piling up. The phones ring and ring...",
        "Ava: You know, this whole desperation bit really messes up the whole hero thing you have going on.",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm not desperate, you know. And I'm no hero.",

        "Guard: I've got shots fired and I need police backup.",

        "Josh: Jonathan, stop talking.",
        "Cassie: Okay, I'm going to call Mel.",
        "Alan: No, no, no. We don't need a lawyer or a doctor. This is a simple misunderstanding, that's all. Just a family matter. You know who I am?",
        "Guard: Yes, Mr. Spaulding. But in cases of domestic violence...",
        "Alan: Domestic violence? There is not domestic violence here. There's no one hurt here. I mean, come on!",
        "Josh: Alan, calm down, all right?",
        "Alan: Josh, stay out of this! This is about my family. Look, I don't know who you are. I'm not going to let some little officer here tell me what is going on. So you tell whoever this is on his radio to back off or I will have their jobs and your job and... and...",
        "Josh: Alan. Alan.",
        "Lizzie: Oh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Yvonna Wright, \"Inside The Light\"... Mel is a lawyer and a doctor. She is an overachiever. I don't know how she does it. Mel is definitely a better doctor than a lawyer. Actually, she's a better doctor than her husband. I think Mel has killed maybe one person, and Rick has a whole list of people that he killed. See Mel, Wednesday, August 23rd, \"Inside The Light.\"",

        "Ava: My friends, the Cooper's, can't stand you, and for a good reason, I hear.",
        "Alan-Michael: Maybe.",
        "Ava: Well, I'm willing to give you a free pass, a clean slate. You saved my life.",
        "Alan-Michael: So you'll take the job?",
        "Ava: No, I'm not going to take a job for someone who's going to use me as a piece of eye candy for all of the suits that walk into his office.",
        "Alan-Michael: You're not just eye candy, Ava. You smell nice, too. It's a compliment; you should be flattered.",
        "Ava: Oh, good, okay. Hello? Memo: It's 2006. You didn't get it. Brain.",
        "Alan-Michael: You know, I think I did miss that memo. Without an assistant, it's tough keeping up with the paperwork.",
        "Ava: Are you ever serious about anything?",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm serious about hiring you. Look, I'm trying to create an image for my office. I have an opening I'd like you to take. But you don't have to take it. You could keep waitressing.",
        "Coop: She'll take it.",
        "Ava: Hey.",
        "Coop: Alan-Michael is offering you a ticket to get out of waitressing. What are you waiting for?",
        "Ava: A boss that isn't so concerned about my measurements.",
        "Coop: So he's a creep. So what?",
        "Ava: So what? I may be dealing with these guys all day long. Are you okay with that?",
        "Coop: It's because you can handle it. Ava, look, I want better than this place for you. Besides, I know you've talked about how you wanted to break into the business world.",
        "Alan-Michael: You should listen to your boyfriend, Ava. Obviously, he's not the type to let petty jealousies consume him.",
        "Coop: No, I'm not. I've also had many encounters and I've learned how to go head- to-head with the Spaulding's, so I think I can handle this.",
        "Alan-Michael: So reading the Spaulding play book, you're an expert on the game.",
        "Coop: I don't play games, Alan-Michael. Which means that if you cross the line even once with Ava, well, I think you know what comes next. So who's up for a margarita?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: This is the part I where I usually point out the exits, but since we're on the street, you can run off in any direction you'd like.",
        "Buzz: I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Olivia: It's more than you bargained for, though.",
        "Buzz: I didn't expect you to tell me that you killed your mother. There must be more to it than that.",
        "Olivia: No, she's dead. It was my fault. That's it.",
        "Buzz: But what happened? I mean, it was an accident.",
        "Olivia: Don't. Don't try and come up with excuses that will let me off the hook because there isn't one.",
        "Buzz: Tell me.",
        "Olivia: We fought all of the time, so this is nothing new. But this one got really nasty. We took it to a whole new level.",
        "Mother: None of this should have happened.",
        "Young Olivia: And yet it did. Giving me a hard time about it won't change anything.",
        "Mother: That's funny coming from you, young lady. But then you always had one set of rules for the world and a separate set for yourself.",
        "Young Olivia: This is so like you, Mom. I'm sick of you judging me.",
        "Mother: Then don't keep giving me something to judge. You should be ashamed of the things you do. But you wear them like a badge, Olivia. Like you're daring me to say something about it.",
        "Young Olivia: I need to live my life the way I want.",
        "Mother: Spending your time with the wrong people? Trying to be someone you're not? That's what you want?",
        "Young Olivia: I know what I don't want. I don't want to be trapped in a dead- end place, Mom. I don't want to be you! Fine, go ahead and cry, Mom, because I'm not apologizing. You have done nothing but put me down my entire life because you're jealous that I want to go off and be someone, and you'll be stuck here being no one until the day that you die. You don't love me. You never have. You didn't even want me! I hate you! Don't ignore me, Mom. Aren't you going to even stand up for yourself? Mom? Mom? Mom. Mom.",
        "Olivia: It was a stroke. It happened just like that. And my last words to her were \"I hate you.\" That was the last thing she ever heard. You can't take something like that back. (Sobbing)",

        "Jonathan: They're together, like they're a couple. Dude, this is so messed up. I mean, I knew they were hanging out, but -- are you going to say something? You're his brother. And Cassie? What's this going to do to Reva when she finds out? She is sick enough already. I was going over there to tell them off because wait until I tell them about the cancer.",

        "Josh: He'll get over it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: So, of course, I lied and told everyone I wasn't even in the room when she died. They bought it.",
        "Buzz: You never told anyone?",
        "Olivia: No. It was just Sam and my sister and me.",
        "Buzz: Who took care of you?",
        "Olivia: We took care of each other. My father was gone, and Sam didn't seem to know what was going on. And it was just me and the family.",
        "Buzz: You were so young.",
        "Olivia: Yeah. I had so many people telling me how strong I was, and how brave I was.",
        "Buzz: They were right. You were a kid. You were a teenager. You should have been having fun, picking out your outfits, not paying the bills.",
        "Olivia: I deserved the life I got.",
        "Buzz: You stepped up, and did what you had to do...",
        "Olivia: It was survival. Marisa and Sam got the wrong end of the deal. They didn't even know I was the person who put us in that position.",
        "Buzz: You're still thinking this?",
        "Olivia: It's not a matter of opinion. I killed my mother.",
        "Buzz: She had a stroke. If she was prone to them, she could have had a stroke at any time.",
        "Olivia: I have tried for years to convince myself that things didn't go down the way it did. But I can't do that. I was there, Buzz, I know what happened. You want to know the worst part? She was just being a good mother. She was just looking out for me because she loved me and wanted what was best for me.",
        "Buzz: When did you figure that out?",
        "Olivia: When I had a daughter of my own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: I got here as soon as I heard. Do you know how he is? I don't understand. You had a gun?",
        "Lizzie: It wasn't mine. It was really dark. I was just trying to protect my baby. I had no idea...",
        "Jonathan: Look, the important thing now is that Alan gets better.",
        "Beth: If I find out you had something to do with this, so help me God.",
        "Rick: I just heard about Alan. What happened?",
        "Beth: How is he?",
        "Mel: Well, his EKG looks normal, but because he was complaining of tightness in the chest, we're going to keep him for observation. It could be a cardiac incident or it could be stress. We're just waiting on the blood work.",
        "Josh: But he's out of the woods?",
        "Mel: Not just yet. We're taking good care of him.",
        "Beth: Mel, when can I see him?",
        "Mel: You can go in there now. Just for a minute. He's been asking about you.",
        "Rick: So how are you doing?",
        "Mel: I called you; I left a message at home.",
        "Rick: I didn't get it. I was out of town. So you're treating Alan?",
        "Mel: No, I'm going to leave it for the doctor on duty.",
        "Rick: That's great, so we can go home.",
        "Mel: I have my car. I'll just see you there. It makes sense.",
        "Rick: Nothing makes any sense, does it? We live in the same house, but we don't do anything together. We don't eat together, we don't even share a bed and we can't share a car ride home.",
        "Mel: We have two cars.",
        "Rick: This isn't about cars. How long am I going to pay for what happened to Phillip, a year, two years?",
        "Mel: Maybe you should ask Dinah or Blake that.",
        "Rick: I'm not asking them.",
        "Mel: The Spaulding's look so at home here because they're here every week with a new drama or a new crisis. And if I'm not treating a Spaulding, I'm being called in to defend one. And you know why, because that family doesn't know how to be a family. It's about trust and love and honesty, and they don't get it. And these are the people you would risk everything for. So now is not the time to be asking me when I'm going to forgive you for what you did.",
        "Beth: Hey, I'm sorry. I heard.",
        "Rick: I didn't know what else to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: They found you.",
        "Beth: I'm here.",
        "Alan: You're not armed, are you?",
        "Beth: Not funny.",
        "Alan: How well I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lillian: Oh, Lizzie. Oh, honey, you're grandfather is going to be fine. You know how strong he is. He'll pull through. And when he does, we're all going to sit down and talk this thing through, 'cause we have all these lies and the suspicions and secrets floating around-- that's what got us here. Everybody knows you didn't want this thing to happen and you didn't make this thing happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: Most of the job is basic clerical stuff, filing, answering phones, scheduling meetings.",
        "Ava: Okay.",
        "Alan-Michael: I think we can skip the part about dress code. You've got that taken care of. Vacation time, two weeks?",
        "Coop: Three.",
        "Alan-Michael: Three?",
        "Ava: Listen to the man.",
        "Alan-Michael: Oh, the man. Fine. Three. Salary? You've got to be kidding, Bradshaw.",
        "Coop: How bad do you want her?",
        "Alan-Michael: Do you let him order for you at restaurants, and how to dress and wear your hair?",
        "Ava: I don't think he wants me that badly.",
        "Alan-Michael: No. I'm just surprised Ms. Girl power let's the guy she's with steer the ship.",
        "Ava: Okay.",
        "Alan-Michael: That's more than he is asking.",
        "Coop: Sweet.",
        "Ava: Well, deal or no deal, Mr. Spaulding?",
        "Alan-Michael: I'll see you tomorrow morning.",
        "Ava: Thanks.",
        "Alan-Michael: You're welcome.",
        "Ava: Thank you! I never would have taken this job without your help. Thank you. I'm taking you out to dinner my first paycheck.",
        "Coop: Order the biggest lobster.",
        "Ava: Order two. I could never have done it without you.",
        "Coop: I'm so proud of you.",
        "Ava: Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Are you there?",
        "Olivia: There is not a lot more to say. You know everything.",
        "Buzz: I know more than that. Sometimes I, um, I see... not a blankness, but sometimes I see a shadow behind your eyes, and now I know why it's there. But I'm still here.",
        "Olivia: For now.",
        "Buzz: I'm not running out on you. I'm done running.",
        "Olivia: You're not going to run when I'm a mess like this. But maybe the day after tomorrow I won't hear from you. Or you'll be too busy to see me this weekend. Or next week something will come up, and you'll have to cancel. You're not going to run, Buzz. You're just going to fade away.",
        "Buzz: (Laughing) You are so wrong. I know you didn't want to tell me this. I can understand it's a lot of stuff, a lot of heavy stuff. But... some guys would run away, they'd fade away, but not this guy. This guy doesn't scare off easy. So it's out there. So what? We can deal with it. All it requires is trust. And understanding. And we have that already. So... you want to go home?",
        "Olivia: Yeah.",
        "Buzz: So what did you fight about?",
        "Olivia: Oh, you're a parent. You know, stuff that kids and parents fight about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: This is just a bump in the road. You'll get better, and we'll welcome Lizzie's baby together. We'll find a way to make peace with her, we will.",
        "Alan: That's why I went over to see her. I wanted to...",
        "Beth: Sh-sh-sh. You need to rest. Mel wants you to save your strength.",
        "Alan: But I want to...",
        "Beth: Okay, I will find her. I won't be far. I promise.",
        "Alan: I'll hold you to that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Maybe we should go.",
        "Josh: Don't you want to stay for Tammy?",
        "Cassie: I do, but I think my being here just makes things worse for her.",
        "Josh: You mean my being here. It's okay, I'll go.",
        "Cassie: No, no. Josh, we're not going to let other people split us up. Jonathan is always going to be on Reva's side. That's how it should be.",
        "Josh: What he doesn't understand is Reva coming home won't matter. She could come walking through those doors right now, and I would still be going home with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Hey, come on. I mean it. He looks good, he really does. He's tired, that's why he is resting, but he looks good.",
        "Lizzie: Okay.",
        "Beth: Now, I have to go to speak to Nana, but I'll be right back. You'll be okay?",
        "Jonathan: She'll be fine.",
        "Beth: I'll be right back.",
        "Tammy: Where are you going?",
        "Jonathan: I have to get out of here. I'm going nuts. This is supposed to be our night together.",
        "Tammy: It's not your fault.",
        "Jonathan: Well, the cops are going to be here soon, and maybe I can meet them outside and waste their time for a little bit so they'll leave Lizzie alone.",
        "Lizzie: You really do care?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, just stay calm and don't go near him.",
        "Lizzie: He's going to get better. He might be hurt, but he's not going to let this stand in his way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Lizzie is at the hospital. She'll be leaving very soon, and I want you to follow her. Me? Oh, I'm fine. Let's just say the rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Are you okay? Is it the baby?",
        "Lizzie: No, no. No, that's not it.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan's right; you should try to relax and not think about Alan. Don't worry about the police, either. You just tell them the truth: You thought you were shooting an intruder.",
        "Lizzie: I can't say that.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, you can.",
        "Lizzie: No, I can't. I knew. I knew it was my granddad. That's why I pulled the trigger.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Dinah: Dare I say ta-da.",
        "Jeffrey: Wow, so much for sulking.",
        "Dinah: What do you want? You know what, I don't care.",
        "Jonathan: That's not called a shooting. That is called an accident.",
        "Gus: That's what I'm here to figure out.",
        "Lizzie: When I did, I pulled the trigger two more times. I wanted him dead.",
        "Tammy: Lizzie!",
        "Alan: We put the gun in Elizabeth's hand. She's the one that pulled the trigger. This September, Jonathan is forced to make a choice.",
        "Lizzie: You can't let them take me away.",
        "Jonathan: I have something I have to say that's is going to change everything.",
        "Alan: Your little game will all be over."
