        "Cassie: You know, I was always jealous of those girls who had boyfriends in the band.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, it looks like you've struck pay dirt this time, huh?",
        "Cassie: You could say that.",
        "Jeffrey: You know, you're not going to get out of this, no matter how much you try to flirt with me.",
        "Cassie: Come on. Come on. Please.",
        "Jeffrey: A promise is a promise.",
        "Cassie: Well, why? Why? Gus and Harley aren't here anymore.",
        "Jeffrey: It doesn't matter. You're still singing.",

        "Dinah: ( Gasps ) Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?",

        "Josh: Yeah, they have that happy new couple look to them.",
        "Reva: Not like us. We're old hat, right? Good old Josh and Reva. Been there, done that.",
        "Josh: That's not... Reva, I'm just saying that things change, you know? Stuff happens.",
        "Reva: \"Stuff happens\"?",
        "Josh: Look at us over the last few weeks.",
        "Reva: Mm-hmm. I'd rather not.",
        "Josh: Excellent.",
        "Reva: Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Look, I would rather just concentrate on what's right, not the bad stuff. I mean, this is a wedding, right? We should be happy.",
        "Josh: You really mean that?",
        "Reva: Yes, I do.",
        "Josh: Okay. Then let's be happy. For Gus and Harley.",
        "Reva: Why don't we be happy for us?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: It is so cool how they just stay together like that.",
        "Coop: Well, I guess you've just got to find ways to keep things interesting.",
        "Lizzie: Oh. Well, I can do that.",
        "Coop: Yes, this is very interesting. What's this?",
        "Lizzie: Look, Coop, I can explain it.",
        "Coop: Don't bother, all right? Lizzie, while everyone else was lining up to kiss the bride, you were too busy ripping her off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Alan, this is Reverend Cartwright. Reverend, Alan Spaulding.",
        "Reverend: Pleasure to meet you.",
        "Alan: A pleasure to meet you, Reverend.",
        "Reverend: Well, I've performed weddings just about everywhere, but this...",
        "Beth: Is a first?",
        "Reverend: Yes. ( Laughter ) Now, before I can proceed, there is one thing I have to know.",
        "Beth: Sure.",
        "Alan: Anything.",
        "Reverend: Is Mr. Spaulding... well, is he competent?",
        "Beth: Reverend...",
        "Alan: Reverend, do you know who I am?",
        "Beth: Alan, dear, I took the liberty of asking your nurse to join us.",
        "Alan: My nurse?",
        "Beth: Yes.",
        "Alan: Really?",
        "Beth: Nurse? Would you please tell the Reverend that Mr. Spaulding is more than capable of saying his vows?",
        "Lillian: Oh, Reverend, believe me, Mr. Spaulding is not the crazy one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: I love weddings.",
        "Danny: Oh, yeah, I can tell by the way you practically tackled everyone to get a hold of that bouquet.",
        "Marina: It was instinct.",
        "Danny: Oh, is that what you call it? Yeah? Did you play football in high school?",
        "Marina: Tight end.",
        "Danny: Well.",
        "Marina: I'm not fishing for a proposal, just so you know.",
        "Danny: Oh, no? Who said you were?",
        "Marina: No one. It's just... I don't know. I mean, we've not even moved in yet. What makes you think that I would buy a used car without giving it a test-drive first?",
        "Danny: Oh, I'm used now?",
        "Marina: Pre-owned.",
        "Danny: Oh, I see. Okay. ( Laughs )",
        "Marina: So it's okay with you that I invited Michelle?",
        "Danny: Yeah. Why wouldn't it be? She's Robbie's mom. I'm glad she's back in town. It's not like we can avoid each other.",
        "Marina: Exactly. I just want to make sure that we're all up front and honest with each other. You know?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Your Uncle Bill's right. Danny deserves to know that he might be a father again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Dinah, what are you doing here?",
        "Dinah: I was looking for you. And guess what? I found you. You're still in love with her, aren't you?",
        "Edmund: What? No. Dinah, I was looking at the monitor, imagining what it's going to be like to wipe the smile off her face.",
        "Dinah: I don't believe you.",
        "Edmund: Dinah, Cassie destroyed any feelings I had for her the moment she took up with Jeffrey O'Neill.",
        "Dinah: Then why are you here, Edmund?",
        "Edmund: To make sure she's happy, to make sure she's carefree, to make sure she's everything we want her to be right before we tear the rug out from underneath her.",
        "Dinah: You were going to throw that bottle at that television.",
        "Edmund: What? No. I was... I was raising it in a toast. To Cassie and Jeffrey, may they enjoy it while they still can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: I love you so much.",
        "Marina: I love you, too.",
        "Danny: You don't know how good it feels to start fresh and escape all the baggage from my past. Just to feel free and happy. With you. Michelle?",
        "Marina: Oh, my God.",
        "Danny: Why didn't you tell me?",
        "Michelle: I didn't want to burden you. I shouldn't have come here.",
        "Danny: No, wait, wait, wait. Michelle. I mean, did you think I would just turn my back on you?",
        "Michelle: Danny, I don't even know who the baby belongs to.",
        "Danny: Well, that doesn't matter.",
        "Michelle: But you love Marina.",
        "Danny: Michelle. Michelle, I couldn't live with myself if I didn't do the right thing, even if that means letting Marina go.",
        "Michelle: ( Sighs ) Can I really do this to Danny?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Here. I wasn't stealing the money, okay? I was just going to borrow it.",
        "Coop: You were going to borrow it? From Gus and Harley's wedding gifts?",
        "Lizzie: Coop, I didn't have the money to buy them a wedding gift.",
        "Coop: Oh, come on, Lizzie. Do you think they really would have noticed?",
        "Lizzie: They would have noticed if I had bought them something nice.",
        "Coop: So you were going to use their money to buy them a gift? Lizzie, that's... that's...",
        "Lizzie: Crazy? Mm-hmm. Yeah.",
        "Coop: No. I wasn't going to say that you were crazy. I'm just...",
        "Lizzie: No, of course not.",
        "Coop: I'm just saying that I don't get why you would do something like that. That's all.",
        "Lizzie: I was embarrassed.",
        "Coop: You were embarrassed? Why? Why would you be embarrassed?",
        "Lizzie: Because I'm sure they expected something nice from me, and I didn't have anything nice to give them.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, what about Company?",
        "Lizzie: What about it?",
        "Coop: You... that's... Lizzie, you gave it back to my family, all right? That was, like, the nicest gift we could have received.",
        "Lizzie: I know, but Coop...",
        "Coop: Anything big or glamorous or extravagant, I mean, that wouldn't have mattered compared to that.",
        "Lizzie: But you know how much I like big, extravagant gestures.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, in case you haven't noticed, we're...",
        "Lizzie: Coop, it's who I am, all right? It may seem over the top to you, but it's all I've ever known.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.",
        "Reva: Ow. ( Laughs )",
        "Josh: I stepped on your foot that time.",
        "Reva: It's okay, really. I was probably leading.",
        "Josh: That's a very bad habit.",
        "Reva: I know. I like it better when you lead. You know, I remember the first time we danced. Miss Martha's parlor. It was a hot summer night and Trish was playing The Carpenters on her brand-new stereo.",
        "Josh: Did I step on your foot back then, too?",
        "Reva: No, I think I stepped on yours. ( Laughter ) So much has happened since then. You know, and just when you think that nothing ever could possibly happen again, people... never mind. Nothing more to drink for me. Otherwise, I'll just keep thinking about him.",
        "Josh: Thinking about who?",
        "Reva: Nate. Nate. And I have to stop, because when I think about him, then he wins, and I won't let him win. I won't let anyone-- especially a ghost-- come between us, Joshua.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Well, Reverend, I think it's time to get this ceremony under way.",
        "Beth: Yes.",
        "Alan: Ladies?",
        "Beth: Yes, could we, please? I have to admit I'm excited myself.",
        "Reverend: You do both seem in a rush.",
        "Alan: Well, we are.",
        "Beth: Do we? Well, it's just that we love each other so much, and we have waited so long for this day. Isn't that right, Pumpkin?",
        "Alan: Yes, we have, Sweetheart.",
        "Reverend: I see. But there is still the matter of Mr. Spaulding's competency.",
        "Beth: Which the nurse is more than happy to address.",
        "Alan: Yes. By all means, Nurse. The suspense is killing me, so why don't you tell the Reverend what he needs to hear?",
        "Beth: Please.",
        "Lillian: Mr. Spaulding is suffering from acute depression brought on by his son's death.",
        "Beth: And?",
        "Lillian: And there is no medical reason to keep the happy couple from going forward on this happy day.",
        "Alan: Thank you, Nurse.",
        "Reverend: Very well.",
        "Beth: I don't know what I'm thinking. I'm a traditional sort of gal. I need to wear white on my wedding. Do you mind if I borrow this? ( Whispers ): Thank you.",
        "Lillian: Well, if I can't stop this train wreck, I guess I have to witness it.",
        "Reverend: Do you have the rings?",
        "Alan: Well, no, I don't...",
        "Beth: I... I have them.",
        "Alan: My parents' rings.",
        "Beth: Yes. Well, I figured Gus and Harley wouldn't be using them.",
        "Alan: Wonderful idea.",
        "Beth: I'm so glad you approve. Oh, and I saw the piece in the \"Mirror\" about us. It's okay. You're not the only one with an agenda. So, what do you say we get this show on the road?",
        "Reverend: Certainly.",
        "Alan: ( Chuckles )",
        "Reverend: Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Where do you think you're going?",
        "Cassie: Uh, you don't want me to sing.",
        "Jeffrey: It's going to be fine. You're going to be cute. It's going to be...",
        "Cassie: Cute? Humiliating myself is cute?",
        "Jeffrey: You're not that bad, really.",
        "Cassie: Are you tone deaf?",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, it's practice, okay? Consider it practice.",
        "Cassie: Oh, I love to practice. I'll practice in the shower. I'll practice in the car. I just don't want to practice here.",
        "Jeffrey: You know what? That's not our deal, okay? Our deal was that the band swallows their pride, and you have to sing.",
        "Cassie: You're not going to let me out of this, are you? Okay. I'll do it on one condition.",
        "Jeffrey: No, no, no. No conditions. No, no negotiating.",
        "Cassie: You're going to like this condition.",
        "Jeffrey: What is it?",
        "Cassie: You have to promise me that after the performance, you're going to take me back to your place and you'll give me a private lesson in your shower.",
        "Jeffrey: You drive a hard bargain, don't you?",
        "Cassie: I knew you'd like it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: I'm sorry I doubted you. I want my own happy ending, you know?",
        "Edmund: And you'll have it.",
        "Dinah: You swear?",
        "Edmund: I swear on everything I hold dear. Cassie will get the heartache she so richly deserves, and you will get her farm.",
        "Dinah: And you. Okay? Best part of all, right?",
        "Edmund: Dinah, darling, you already have me. ( Cell phone rings ) Oh, good. It's my lawyer. He probably has news about the divorce. Excuse me. Vince?",
        "Russo: You got it, Big Daddy.",
        "Edmund: Are you telling me you have good news?",
        "Russo: Well, meet me, and I'll tell you.",
        "Edmund: I don't have time for games, Russo. Just tell me.",
        "Russo: Now, now, easy. I just thought you were with your lady friend and you'd like some privacy.",
        "Edmund: All right, where are you? Good, that's not far. I'll see you in a bit. Oh. That was Russo. He said he found a judge who will push paperwork through for us.",
        "Dinah: That's great. That's great. Well, good. I'm sure you're going to meet with him, right?",
        "Edmund: Yes, I have to. And you have to get to bed, so I'll see you later, all right?",
        "Dinah: Uh, uh, uh, uh. I want one dance, first.",
        "Edmund: One dance?",
        "Dinah: Mm-hmm.",
        "Edmund: Dinah, we can't. If Cassie sees you.",
        "Dinah: She won't know any better. Come on, one little dance, that's all I ask.",
        "Edmund: Okay. Okay, but let me get you a drink first.",
        "Dinah: I don't want a drink.",
        "Edmund: Let me get you a drink. Yes. It relieves stress. Just don't let anyone smell it on your breath, all right?",
        "Dinah: Ah, you spoil me.",
        "Edmund: Well, I... I enjoy it.",
        "Dinah: ( Whistles ) Strong.",
        "Edmund: May I get you anything else?",
        "Dinah: Nope. Just that dance.",
        "Edmund: Ah. Of course. I wouldn't miss it for the world. ( Laughs ) Oh, this is nice, isn't it?",
        "Dinah: Mm-hmm. Are we dancing?",
        "Edmund: Are we ever? There we go. Right there. Oh, we're perfect, no? Very good. Right. Let's see. ( Laughs ) Oh, don't slip. Hold on, hold on, hold on. There we are. Oh! You're a thing of beauty.",

        "Alan: Reverend, I want to thank you very much for this.",
        "Beth: Yes, yes, thank you, Reverend. And, Nurse, thank you so much for the use of your coat. Would you please stop crying? You're going to make the minister suspicious.",

        "Alan: Well, most people wouldn't.",
        "Beth: And Phillip?",

        "Beth: Good. I'm glad to know you're clear on that, because there's something I've been waiting to tell you. They opened Phillip's grave.",

        "Josh: Okay. Is this a position that needs to be filled now or...",
        "Coop: It's for a friend of mine. She just... well, she just kind of really needs a break, but the problem is that she doesn't have a lot of experience.",
        "Josh: I see. This friend, by any chance, does she happen to be very rich?",
        "Coop: Um, not anymore. Look, Lizzie is a great girl. She's... she's really a great girl, but she just needs something to help break out of her shell. She needs something that's going to challenge her. Look, she is great at makeup, she's got great fashion sense.",
        "Josh: ( Laughs )",
        "Coop: And she can make a great pot of coffee, so she's got that going for her.",
        "Josh: Okay, okay, okay. Just... I think it's wonderful that you want to do this for Lizzie, but are you sure it's what she wants?",

        "Beth: Rick opened the coffin. Confirmed what we've all known for months: Phillip is dead.",
        "Alan: So, Rick made the ID?",
        "Beth: Yes. Why?",
        "Alan: Well, I just didn't think Rick had it in him. I didn't know that he was strong enough to put his emotions aside and do the right thing.",
        "Beth: Well, it was very difficult for him.",
        "Alan: I'm sure it was. I guess I underestimated Rick.",
        "Beth: As much as I miss Phillip, I'm glad that these rumors have been put to rest. He's gone.",

        "Edmund: Well, it's nice to know you can keep your mouth shut.",
        "Russo: My lips are sealed. Besides, who's going to believe that Alan locked Phillip in a room with a doctor and a nurse on call?",
        "Edmund: So it is true.",
        "Russo: My lips are sealed, like I said. But the best part is-- and don't laugh-- Alan says he fixed the room up like the Spaulding boardroom, so a delusional Phillip wouldn't know anything had changed.",
        "Edmund: ( Laughs ) Sorry. It's pure genius.",
        "Russo: In a fruit-loopy sort of way. Why do you even care?",

        "Russo: Right, so when? In a few months. The woman pops out the little bugger; you are set.",
        "Edmund: A couple of months? I don't have a couple of months. I need a baby now.",
        "Russo: Well, these things take time. I mean, what do you want me to do? Make a donation to the sperm bank in exchange for a newborn?",
        "Edmund: If that's what it takes, man, you'd better believe it.",

        "Marina: Stop it. ( Laughs ) No. Then again, I didn't have a very normal childhood.",
        "Danny: Well, I know the feeling. But it's okay, though. I think that everything I've gone through, everywhere I've been, it's okay because it brought me to where I am right now, and I like very much where I am right now.",
