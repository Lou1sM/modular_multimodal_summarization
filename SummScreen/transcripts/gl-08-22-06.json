        "Jeffrey: Hey! Come on, let's go. I didn't spring you from jail so that you could use up all my hot water. You've got to get ready and get cracking, get Jeffrey Boy some votes. Don't tell me you're sulking again!",
        "Dinah: Dare I say: Tah-dah.",
        "Jeffrey: Wow. So much for sulking.",
        "Dinah: Yup. I call it my get-out-of-jail dress. You like it?",
        "Jeffrey: Very nice.",
        "Dinah: Nice? Nice. Well, this dress-- specifically me in this dress-- is going to be your secret weapon. I am going to sew up the Spaulding endorsement for you, along with getting every male vote in this town-- except for Mallet's. This was his favorite dress. Won't be getting his vote.",
        "Jeffrey: All right, come on now. Hey, hey, hey. Let's keep it going. Keep the momentum going. Huh? You can do this. All right, here. Here's your bag. Okay, you ready? You ready to go? All right, you know what, just call him, all right. You joined my campaign, not a convent. There's no vow of celibacy.",
        "Dinah: Okay, FYI: The detective I am no longer with and I have given up on every other man on the planet. Love sucks. (Knocking on the door)",
        "Mallet: Dinah, I know you're in there. Open up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Remember, I want you to keep tabs on Elizabeth as soon as she leaves the hospital.",
        "Beth: What the hell is going here? Lizzie is out there thinking she almost killed her grandfather, and you're in here faking it?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Jonathan was right. You should just try to relax and not think about Alan. And don't worry about the police, either. You just tell them the truth. Tell them you thought you were shooting an intruder.",
        "Lizzie: I can't say that.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, you can.",
        "Lizzie: No, I knew. I knew it was granddad, that's why I shot him.",
        "Tammy: You shot Alan on purpose? No, you don't mean that.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, I was just fighting back. Look, I am going to do whatever I have to do to protect us from that man. Anything!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Hey, Gus. Are you here as her uncle or as a cop?",
        "Gus: A little of both.",
        "Jonathan: All right, don't turn this into a whole investigation thing.",
        "Gus: Jonathan, there was a gun fire and there's a man in a hospital.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, but there were blanks in the gun.",
        "Gus: I know that.",
        "Jonathan: Well then that's not called a shooting; that's called an accident.",
        "Gus: Well that's what I'm here to figure out.",
        "Jonathan: Look, Lizzie is pregnant and she's scared. Just don't do this now.",
        "Gus: Take it easy.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, wait.",
        "Gus: Don't. Not with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: This doesn't make any sense. The room was pitch black when Alan came in there. You couldn't have any idea who you were aiming the gun at.",
        "Lizzie: You're right, I didn't, but after I pulled the trigger once, I saw granddad in the flash, and when I did, I pulled the trigger two more times.",
        "Tammy: Lizzie...",
        "Lizzie: I wanted him dead.",
        "Gus: How you doing, kid?",
        "Lizzie: You're here to question me.",
        "Jonathan: I told him not to do this tonight. You've already been through enough.",
        "Gus: This is not going to take long.",
        "Lizzie: You just have to understand. Granddad wants my baby, period.",
        "Gus: Why is that?",
        "Lizzie: Because my mom lost hers, and now he wants to replace it with mine. Make everything okay in his world. You know how granddad is. He makes up his own rules. He doesn't care how it affects anybody else!",
        "Gus: I understand that's true, but we still need to talk, okay.",
        "Jonathan: Look, what happened is, Alan broke into our room.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan.",
        "Gus: I don't need to hear it from you. I need to talk to her. Is that true? Did he break into the room?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, he did break into the room because the door was locked, because she said she heard someone turn the key in lock. So Alan probably paid off the guy at the front desk.",
        "Gus: Would you please let her speak.",
        "Jonathan: And once he enters the room, does he turn on the light? No. Does he stop or answer when Lizzie calls out, who's there?",
        "Gus: Enough!",
        "Jonathan: What would you do if someone broke into your room, it's dark, they keep coming towards you? You would protect yourself. Especially if you're on edge from all the stuff your grandfather's been doing to lately. That's what Lizzie did, she protected herself.",
        "Gus: That's enough. Let's go; I'm taking you down to the station.",
        "Jonathan: What, are you going to arrest her?",
        "Gus: No, I'm questioning her.",
        "Lizzie: Do I have to go?",
        "Gus: Yes.",
        "Tammy: Okay, we'll call Mel and make sure she meets us down at the station.",
        "Jonathan: You know what? You're bringing in the wrong Spaulding because the one you should be bringing in is in there.",
        "Gus: Look, Jon-boy, don't you realize you're making things worse? Or are you really just that stupid?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Don't you realize that by playing sick, you're making things worse for Lizzie. Hasn't she been through enough? Haven't we all?",
        "Alan: Absolutely. That's why it is critical that I do the right thing for this baby.",
        "Beth: What? That's what this is all supposed to be about?",
        "Alan: Beth, that incident tonight, as unfortunate as it might be, possibly was the best thing that could happen.",
        "Beth: For the baby?",
        "Alan: For the family. Elizabeth finally realizes that she is not stable enough to raise a child. Therefore you and I can step in and--",
        "Beth: No.",
        "Alan: What's wrong?",
        "Beth: Lizzie loves that baby!",
        "Alan: Elizabeth loves her dog. She loves shopping. She loves chocolate sundaes. The baby is not even a reality to her. And Jonathan Randall? He's not fit enough to raise a dog, much less a child. Neither one of them are equipped enough to raise a Spaulding heir. The risk is too great, Beth.",
        "Beth: Don't you realize that Lizzie could be brought up on charges for what happened tonight?",
        "Alan: That's not going to happen. Gus will take care of her. Now the worst thing that could happen is she comes out looking rather troubled. I don't think that is a bad thing. Remember, the gun was filled with blanks. No one was harmed.",
        "Beth: Oh, my God. You knew, didn't you? You went into that room to deliberately scare Lizzie into shooting you, knowing full well you'd be facing blanks and not bullets. Oh, my God.",
        "Alan: We put the gun in Elizabeth's hand. She's the one that pulled the trigger.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: I'm not going to deal with this.",
        "Dinah: You know what, no one asked you to. What do you want? You know what? I don't care what you want. Because I'm busy.",
        "Mallet: Yeah? Doing what?",
        "Dinah: Well, um... you know, handling being arrested for arson, clearing my name, you know, the usual.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, sorry about that.",
        "Dinah: Now, are you sorry for the fact that I got hauled off to jail or that I'm not there, or that, I don't know, you're the jerk that got my busted?",
        "Mallet: Can you let me explain that?",
        "Dinah: Mallet, what do you do for fun now that I'm gone and you're not making your reports to the feds or humiliating me to the public? I mean you must have a lot of time on your hands.",
        "Mallet: Can we stop doing this please?",
        "Dinah: Sure. I was just about to close the door.",
        "Mallet: O'Neill, do you mind giving us a minute here, alone.",
        "Dinah: Oh, no, no, no. Whatever you have to say, you can say in front of Jeffrey. We have no secrets. Go ahead.",
        "Mallet: So what's... what's going on with you two?",
        "Dinah: With Jeffrey and me? Well, I mean can't you tell. I mean I'm in his room. It's obvious. We're having a torrid affair. You better stay away from me or you're going to get burned, next time.",
        "Jeffrey: Feel better now?",
        "Dinah: No. I feel awful.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Hey. Have a seat. Okay, Lizzie, I want you to tell me everything that happened before, during and after the shooting tonight, okay? And try not to leave anything out.",
        "Lizzie: Gus, how bad can this get for me and the baby?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: This is such a mess.",
        "Tammy: Mel said she would get down here as soon as she could.",
        "Jonathan: I'm not talking about Lizzie. We got engaged tonight. But once again, the focus, all of our priorities is Lizzie and the kid.",
        "Tammy: Would you rather ignore them?",
        "Jonathan: It's just that there's stuff going on with everybody: Lizzie, Josh and Cassie, Reva--",
        "Tammy: Reva, what do you mean?",
        "Jonathan: Nothing. Let's go over there.",
        "Gus: Lizzie, did you know there were blanks in the gun when you pulled the trigger?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Uh...",
        "Blake: Oh!",
        "Mallet: Sorry, Blake, that was my fault.",
        "Blake: Yeah. Let me guess: Your mind's on a case, right?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, you could say that. A tough case. What's going on with you? How you doing? The campaign, how's it going?",
        "Blake: Well, let's see. 73% of the female voters think that my reputation is shot because of that little sex video on the web site. And apparently I need a makeover, as if changing my clothes is going to help.",
        "Mallet: Hmm well, I don't know, you look fine to me.",
        "Blake: See, you're a male voter. What do you know about women?",
        "Mallet: Absolutely nothing.",
        "Blake: Oh, let me guess-- Dinah.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, you could say that. I was just trying to talk to her, and she slammed the door in my face, the door to Jeffrey O'Neill's room.",
        "Blake: Jeffrey's?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, you don't remember that he saved Dinah, decided not to press arson charges against her?",
        "Blake: So Dinah was in Jeffrey's room? Do you think that something was going on with those two?",
        "Mallet: Well, that's how it looks. But my gut tells me that is not true. I don't know, I don't know. What do you think?",
        "Blake: You know what, I think you're probably right. I don't think there's anything to worry about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Well, wish me luck.",
        "Jeffrey: What do you need luck for when you've got that dress? How could Alan- Michael refuse any request that you make?",
        "Dinah: You know, why are you so obsessed with becoming mayor? I mean you have a great job at the D.A.'s office.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm not interested in a career.",
        "Dinah: No. You're interested in money, power, influence.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, never mind.",
        "Dinah: No. I mean I get it. I get it. I know that you're trying to become a man that you've always wanted to be, like Richard.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I didn't say that.",
        "Dinah: Well, I was there, too, you know. I remember. I remember how much fun you had being somebody else, not yourself. We're both trying to get over our past.",
        "Jeffrey: I'll be over at campaign headquarters.",
        "Dinah: I think that I need to clean some slates myself. Put Mallet in the rear-view mirror, and the quicker I do that, the smoother ride it will be.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, let's just say I work for the united nations government and I have a proposal for you.",
        "Dinah: What sort of proposal?",
        "Jeffrey: I need a wife.",
        "Dinah: You want to marry me?",
        "Jeffrey: As soon as possible.",
        "Dinah: Why don't you tell me what stole your heart. A change of scenery might be nice.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that goes without saying.",
        "Dinah: Okay. What-- what are you doing?",
        "Mallet: Just so you know, we're not finished. I'm not going to give up on that us. But you did start that fire, and we both know it. I think it is time your honest with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Alan-Michael came to me last night very concerned. Seems Elizabeth approached him about getting a gun to protect herself from me.",
        "Beth: Are you telling me he went along with your plan?",
        "Alan: He was very worried. So I told him, I said all right go ahead and get her a gun because if we don't give it to her, she'll get it somewhere else. But I said, put blanks in it because I think she is capable of hurting herself or someone else. And if there hadn't been blanks in that gun, she would have killed me.",
        "Beth: And maybe she would have done us all a favor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Lizzie, you're my niece and I love you, but you have to answer the question. Did you know there were blanks in the gun, or were you shooting to kill?",
        "Jonathan: Look, if you're going to blame anyone, blame me because I'm the reason Lizzie had a gun in the first place. I got it for her.",
        "Doris: Making you an accessory to the attempted murder of Alan Spaulding. I should have known you were in on this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael O'Leary, \"Inside The Light.\" Harley is a fireball. Alan is a (bleep). Beth is Glenn Close. Mel is serene. Beth Ehlers is fun. Ron Raines is crazy. Beth Chamberlin, she just has it all. Yvonna Wright is somebody that will be the friend for the rest of my life. I do love doing imitations. (Imitating Josh) Well, Billy, it looks like Reva's had a hard time. What are you going to do about it? (Imitating Billy) We'll do something, little buddy. Reva's made more bends than a pearl diver. And if she doesn't get her act together, I'm going to tell Joshua to-- hey, look. Hey, you know, Josh, hey. (Rambling) The other day I started looking at Reva, I said hey, Reva you've get up and stand up and be lucky that you're alive. I'm going to tell you something, little buddy. (Rambling) See Rick, Wednesday, August 23rd, \"Inside The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: You're not going to get anywhere trying to make a case out of this.",
        "Doris: A case out of attempted murder, you mean?",
        "Jonathan: The gun had blanks in it. Alan broke into the room and it was dark.",
        "Doris: So you say. Do you?",
        "Lizzie: Jonathan has nothing to do with this. He's just trying to help.",
        "Gus: Lizzie, I don't think you should say anything else until your lawyer shows up.",
        "Doris: You know what? You might want to think about retaining counsel for yourself-- again.",
        "Tammy: Mrs. Wolfe, this is not what you think.",
        "Doris: Oh, how sweet, the girlfriend comes to his defense one more time.",
        "Jonathan: Back off, Wolfe.",
        "Doris: Look, Mr. Randall, this is how I see it: You deliberately set your sights on the richest girl in town, thinking dollar signs all the way, deliberately get her pregnant, convince her life would be swell if only Mr. Spaulding would be rid of. And you could run off with a serious chunk of the family fortune. Trouble is you had to make the murder self-defense. Pretty predictable, actually. I'm actually kind of disappointed.",
        "Jonathan: Are you?",
        "Doris: Mm-hmm. Not as disappointed as you must be. Given that in the end, your lover, cousin, or whatever you call him, would just grab all the money for himself. Leave everyone behind, because that's pretty much his--",
        "Jonathan: (Laughing) Doris, it's a little early in the morning to start drinking.",
        "Doris: Hmm.",
        "Jonathan: (Laughing)",
        "Lizzie: Wait a second, all right? You have this all backwards. My granddad came after me tonight. I can prove it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: I'm not a monster, Beth.",
        "Beth: Oh, no. No, you are just a typical doting grandfather, out to make a granddaughter's pregnancy as care-free as possible.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth is not capable and stable enough, emotionally or mentally to raise a child. I'm not the only one who feels that way. Lillian and Alexandra both agree with me.",
        "Beth: I see it, now, you figured that you would goad Lizzie to the brink of murder so you can prove it. You are a monster.",
        "Alan: Beth, I--",
        "Beth: No, you are deliberately trying to push her over the edge.",
        "Alan: I am pushing, but not so much that I couldn't pull her back if I needed to.",
        "Beth: And all this so you could control your family?",
        "Alan: No, to allow my family to become what it should.",
        "Beth: How? By taking Lizzie's baby away, maybe her sanity?",
        "Alan: Call it tough love. But what we are doing is keeping her safe from a disastrous existence from that sociopath Jonathan Randall.",
        "Beth: Oh, Alan. I have seen you do some terrible things, but this is... this is the worst.",
        "Alan: No, Beth, this is not terrible. Don't you understand? This is the best thing I've ever done. Listen to me. I am doing this for you. Now I can give you the child that you wanted so badly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: Jeffrey O'Neill, not just the candidate, but a hero. Got a little ring to it, you know?",
        "Jeffrey: What are you talking about?",
        "Blake: I heard that you saved Dinah, sprung her from jail. The question is: Why? Now it could be an attempt to woo the female vote. I mean the sensitive D.A. showing compassion towards woman..",
        "Jeffrey: Blake, I did it for you.",
        "Blake: For me?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. Dinah is your stepdaughter, and you have been through the year from hell. And I didn't want you to have to go through anymore family heartache. Besides, after you lose the election, it would be nice to have Dinah around to comfort you.",
        "Blake: Oh, Jeffrey, that's so sweet. You little liar. You know, you... you helped Dinah because there is a payoff and if it has nothing to do with the election, then it has to do with something else, but it's something!",
        "Jeffrey: Blake, you're jealous.",
        "Blake: No, I think you're insane.",
        "Jeffrey: Dinah and I are not romantically involved, just like you and I are not romantically involved. Or anyone else for that matter.",
        "Blake: This just keeps better and better.",
        "Jeffrey: Blake, we agreed to end it.",
        "Blake: We don't agree on anything, Jeffrey. That's what makes us so much fun.",
        "Jeffrey: Us. See, no, there is no us. You see, we're not in any relationship.",
        "Blake: If I were interested in a relationship, there would be absolutely no way that I would be going off to your room with you right now.",
        "Jeffrey: My room?",
        "Blake: And, we'll take separate rooms. The last person who gets there...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Now just admit that you started this fire, all right, so we can get on with putting this behind us.",
        "Dinah: Why are you so hot to hear me say it? You got a wire on you? Huh?",
        "Mallet: You want to check? Why don't you check, huh? Take your time, you don't want to miss a spot. Huh?",
        "Dinah: Stop it.",
        "Mallet: You satisfied that, huh, that we're alone. It's just you and me.",
        "Dinah: You know how that fire started? Do you know where that fire started? It started in my mind, the night that I saw that stupid web site pop up at the engagement party. Because when I looked at that and I saw the reports you were making on me to the feds in secret, I realized that you would never, ever trust me, no matter how hard I busted my tail to prove myself.",
        "Mallet: It's not about that. You know it's not about me not trusting you--",
        "Dinah: Stop it. You want me to explain? Why don't you sit down and shut up and let me explain it, okay? Enough talking. The night that I was in my room at the Beacon, I was looking at our stuff, at our invitations, at our samples, at our things. And I thought, wow, okay, they're laughing at me. I think that they're mocking me, and they're saying to me, you know, you will never, ever have anything as normal as a wedding day. Not you, never in this lifetime. So I piled everything up, on top of the bed, and I lit it on fire.",
        "Mallet: Did you put my clothes on top?",
        "Dinah: Yes I did. Yes, I did because I wanted every atom of what belonged to you to be gone-- or such much as reminded me of you. But I did not leave that fire to spread. I went in, I put it out. I thought I put it out.",
        "Mallet: Baby, this is good. This is good. So, basically, it was an accident.",
        "Dinah: What are you nuts? You think a jury is going to care about that?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, but it's only going to make it worse if you don't face it.",
        "Dinah: No, no. I see where you're going with this. The little wheels are turning in your heard. You want me to strike a deal-- I'm assuming-- and you want me to cop to a lesser charge. Is that right?",
        "Mallet: We can get you out of this.",
        "Dinah: Jeffrey has already got me out of this. Because I'll tell you something: If you put me in a courtroom, I will deny that I was ever in that stinking hotel. You know why? Because I'm not going to prison again.",
        "Mallet: I don't want you to go back to prison, either. Baby, why didn't you tell me this?",
        "Dinah: Because I wasn't so sure you would protect me. And Jeffrey's doing that for me now anyway.",
        "Mallet: What's the deal with him? What is it, some kind of payback?",
        "Dinah: That's my business. You look me in the eye and tell me you would have lied or hidden evidence for me just to keep me out of jail.",
        "Mallet: I don't know. But I'll tell you what I am sure of. Come on, we can fight this. Or we can come out of this together. Just tell me you'll give us another chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: My granddad built this nursery. There are locks on the doors, bars on the windows, surveillance cameras everywhere. It's like a maximum security nursery. Me and my baby will both be prisoners there until he takes her from me all together. You guys...",
        "Tammy: Okay, take it easy, all right? It's okay.",
        "Lizzie: You believe me, right?",
        "Gus: Why don't we check it out.",
        "Doris: You can't be serious. The girl is delusional.",
        "Gus: If there is a nursery like this, it would put a spin on the story, don't you think? If she's telling the truth. But if she isn't telling the truth...",
        "Doris: Then that little rich girl is looking at attempted murder. All right, Ms. Spaulding, let's take a little field trip to the Spaulding mansion.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Alan, you think you can just replace the baby that I lost?",
        "Alan: We lost.",
        "Beth: With Lizzie's baby? Then we can what, we can just pick up where we left off as parents, never skipping a beat?",
        "Alan: Beth, don't you have a void inside of you for the loss of that child?",
        "Beth: Of course I do. I carried that baby for months. Alan... Alan, a baby is not like an appliance. You don't just plug in a new one when the old one is gone.",
        "Alan: That baby-- I saw that baby as the ultimate gift for us.",
        "Beth: But, Alan, this baby is not our baby. It's Lizzie's.",
        "Alan: And what's the responsibility of a parent? To love, protect, support and give that child the best life possible, and that's exactly what we are doing for Elizabeth.",
        "Beth: What?! By taking her baby away from her is being loving and supportive?",
        "Alan: No, but by freeing her of the responsibility of taking care of that child. Something she cannot handle.",
        "Beth: And team Spaulding comes in and raises this baby as their own and we all live happily ever after. Is that it?",
        "Alan: Elizabeth's behavior has become very unbalanced, reminding me of something that we both know about. Now she is very sensitive, just like her father. When Phillip fell apart, it took a bullet to stop him.",
        "Beth: Lizzie is not going to end up like Phillip.",
        "Alan: Neither is the baby if we act now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: For the record, I don't agree with the polls.",
        "Blake: What?",
        "Jeffrey: About the makeover.",
        "Blake: Wow. For that, you almost have that vote.",
        "Jeffrey: And I'm glad we're on the same page about, you know, our non- relationship. Oh. You know what, I'm sorry. I don't mean to rush, but--",
        "Blake: Don't worry. Dinah will never know that I was here, unless I tell her. Just kidding.",
        "Jeffrey: I just don't want there to be any awkwardness. You understand?",
        "Blake: Oh, I understand all about awkwardness. And speaking of Dinah...",
        "Jeffrey: Dinah's a valuable friend. Let's, you know, leave it at that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: You know what I want to do right now?",
        "Mallet: Tell me.",
        "Dinah: I just want to walk right out of here and go back to our room, but we can't.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, we can do that. Yes, we can.",
        "Dinah: No, we can't, because it's all gone, the room, us, as if it never really existed.",
        "Mallet: Are you crazy? Of course we existed.",
        "Dinah: I'm crazy for believing I would ever get away with this.",
        "Mallet: What is \"this?\"",
        "Dinah: Having love and compassion and joy in my life. And I am a complete idiot.",
        "Mallet: Don't talk like that. Don't say stuff like that.",
        "Dinah: It's true. I mean it's nice. I mean we had those memories of believing in one another, and me believing that you trusted me, but we just happen to look back on now.",
        "Mallet: No, no, no. We can look forward.",
        "Dinah: Look forward? I am looking forward to my life, Mallet, and I see it. And I see that-- you know, wow, that is the life I was meant to have, only it's the same life I always had. I was kidding myself to think that it would ever be any different.",
        "Mallet: So is Jeffrey O'Neill part of this new life, this new package?",
        "Dinah: Jeffrey and I are close. We're close. We know each other. We know each other at our roots, and there is no secrecy. Just acceptance.",
        "Mallet: Right, right. As opposed to love, as opposed to happiness and joy, hmm? Satisfaction? I'm not giving up on us.",
        "Dinah: You know what the truth is? The truth is that you already gave up on us before we even got it started. So you need to let it go. Let us go. What there was of us. Anyway.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Okay, this is it. See, what did I tell you, it is locked.",
        "Doris: All of the rooms in this hallway are locked.",
        "Gus: Do you have the key?",
        "Lizzie: No. Just kick it in or something. Look, once you see what is in there, you'll see why I have to protect myself from my grandfather.",
        "Gus: (Sighs) Can you give me a hand on this?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: Buy you a cup of coffee?",
        "Dinah: No thank you.",
        "Blake: How about a drink?",
        "Dinah: Maybe another time.",
        "Blake: Dinah...",
        "Dinah: You know what, Blake, I really would like to be on my own for right now.",
        "Blake: Hooking up with Jeffrey is just going to make your life miserable. I know all about it. Not to understate the obvious, but Jeffrey doesn't do anything without an agenda.",
        "Dinah: Well, at least I can understand his agenda.",
        "Blake: Really? What is it?",
        "Dinah: Good night, Blake.",
        "Blake: Mallet reminds me so much of Ross.",
        "Dinah: You know what, we're done here.",
        "Blake: Dinah, if you let Mallet go, you're going to regret it for the rest of your life. Trust me. You should make it right with that guy.",
        "Dinah: You looking out for me, Blake? Is that what you're doing, you looking out for me?",
        "Blake: Maybe I am.",
        "Dinah: I think you're a liar. I don't think you give a damn about my love life. All you care about is Jeffrey, and you want him for yourself. Good luck with that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Knock on the door)",
        "Mallet: Whoa! Are you heading out again?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, right now.",
        "Mallet: You're a busy, busy fellow tonight.",
        "Jeffrey: Good thing. Unlike you hanging around my door, moaning over Dinah.",
        "Mallet: I don't know what's going on between you two, but you better not hurt her.",
        "Jeffrey: Protective ex-boyfriend, you've got to love it.",
        "Mallet: So, what's this about? Come on, man, what's in for you? Come clean, let's go.",
        "Jeffrey: Dinah and I have a mutually beneficial relationship, Mallet.",
        "Mallet: Like hell. What does she have on you?",
        "Jeffrey: What would she have? My life's an open book, past and present. Evening.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: It was all here, I swear. The locks, the bars on the windows. I don't know how he did this, okay. I don't know how he changed it so fast.",
        "Doris: Have you seen enough? Have you seen enough, because I have. Elizabeth Spaulding, you are arrested for the attempted murder of Alan Spaulding. Detective, read her her rights.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Beth, we both know that Elizabeth is not well. But it is not too late to save her. Say you will join me in this?",
        "Beth: You keep this up, you're not going to save Lizzie. You're going to push her away forever, just like Phillip.",
        "Alan: That's not true. What about you? What about all of the bad things I did to you, all those years, and now look at you. Here you are my wife.",
        "Beth: Yes, here I am. I guess that does prove anything is possible.",
        "Alan: You married me by choice, because it was the right thing for you to do in your life, and you didn't care what anyone else said.",
        "Beth: Yes. But, Alan...",
        "Alan: Don't fight me on this, Beth. I've seen the future. It's very clear. I am going to have what I want, and I want you and Lizzie and the baby. That's the way it's going to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: And you have the right to consult with a lawyer before questioning. You have the right to have a lawyer present during questioning. Do you understand?",

        "Leah: Is mom already gone?",

        "Rick: It just fills me with something I've never been able to find anywhere else. Not even close.",
