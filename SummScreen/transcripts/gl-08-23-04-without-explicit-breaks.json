        "Gus: Hey.",
        "Beth: Hey.",
        "Gus: Well, hello. You waiting on a date?",
        "Beth: Not that I'm aware of. You want to sit? Unless you're here for...",
        "Gus: I'm here for the food. Just... just the food.",
        "Beth: She's not here, gus.",
        "Gus: Who?",
        "Beth: Harley, love of your life, woman you almost married? Ring any bells?",
        "Gus: Not looking for her. I know it's taken me long enough, but I've finally realized that harley and I are done.",
        "Beth: I see. So I guess that's why you came into her family's restaurant. No, uh-uh. You wouldn't expect to see her here.",
        "Frank: All right, sis. Last chance to change your mind.",
        "Harley: Well, you know what, frank? I have changed my mind. You can take the big room on the left, and dad can have the little room at the end of the hall.",
        "Frank: Ah, what a comedian. Anyway, all right, this could be the biggest mistake the coopers ever had in their lives.",
        "Harley: Come on!",
        "Frank: It's got disaster written all over it.",
        "Harley: Where is your thoughts of family? Where's your bunker mentality?",
        "Buzz: Where's our common sense? You know, at my restaurant, the staff is taking bets which one of us will be murdered first by the others.",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, you know what, pop? My money is on you, because harley and I have already lived together.",
        "Harley: (Laughs)",
        "Buzz: I should never have sold the firehouse.",
        "Harley: Oh, come on. It'll be fun, daddy. Come on, and besides, we have no choice. Frank's place already rented, and lord knows how long you'll have a roof over your head.",
        "Frank: Now there's a comforting thought.",
        "Harley: It's a great idea, and you know it. Hey, the spauldings are coming after us. They can't get us if we stick together. Besides, it's good for the boys, you know? They have male influence in the house, a little guidance, a little discipline. What is that?",
        "Buzz: It's a lamp. Where do you want me to put it?",
        "Harley: Somebody else's house?",
        "Frank: (Laughs)",
        "Buzz: Let's reload. Oh, god.",
        "Frank: What are you doing here?",
        "Phillip: It's my night with my son. I'm here to pick him up. Did you forget?",
        "Harley: Get out.",
        "Danny: You want to leave me?",
        "Michelle: I'm not leaving you as in breaking up. I just think we need some time apart. I know you've got to feel that, too. I mean, you don'T... is this how you want our marriage to be? You going behind my back to somebody like ross marler to make me do what you think is right for me?",
        "Danny: Michelle, I talked to ross because I was concerned about you. If you go into business with tony, you're only going to get hurt.",
        "Michelle: Because you don't think I can take care of myself.",
        "Danny: No. That's not why...",
        "Michelle: No, no, no. You know... I don't want to fight. I don't want to fight.",
        "Danny: I don't want to fight either! You know what? In fact, let's just not talk, at all!",
        "Cassie: I know, honey. Okay, sweetheart. Mm-hmm.",
        "Dinah: Well, edmund, you and I both know that if jeffrey wants something, he will do anything to get it. And if cassie is something that he wants...",
        "Edmund: (Hyperventilating) I've had enough of you and jeffrey o'neill.",
        "Cassie: What is going on with you?",
        "Edmund: You make love to me, and then you call him?",
        "Cassie: Jeffrey o'neill? I wasn't on the phone with jeffrey o'neill. I was on the phone with the kids, edmund!",
        "Edmund: Oh, come on, cassie. How can you possibly expect me to believe that?",
        "Dinah: You set me up.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, look at it this way, dinah: At least we had a little fun before you go bye- bye. (Struggling) I warned you what would happen if you came back here to springfield to try to cause trouble.",
        "Dinah: Trouble? You want trouble, jeffrey? Huh? Then please, by all means, have them come right in here. You know why? Because any fool can see what happened here. My clothes are ripped. Huh? See those scratches on your neck? Yeah. You raped me.",
        "Michelle: Just because I want us to live separately doesn't mean I want to leave you.",
        "Danny: Okay. Then what does it mean, michelle?",
        "Michelle: Selling this house is a perfect example of why we need some time apart. You're making a huge sacrifice, danny. You're leaving a lot of memories behind. It's going to break your heart. But I don't feel that. I don't share those memories with you. I mean, I wish I do, for your sake, but I don't, and that's not going to change.",
        "Danny: Michelle, I'm not asking you to do anything that you can't do.",
        "Michelle: No, you're not asking. You hope. And that makes it even harder.",
        "Danny: So... right, so being apart, that's the answer?",
        "Michelle: You told me that we've always managed to find our way back to each other, so believe in that, all right, and let me go.",
        "Gus: She offered to take me back, you know? But there's a catch. I've got to turn my back on my entire family, and that includes alan. I've got to cut my own father loose. I mean, do you think that's fair? Do you think that's right?",
        "Beth: No.",
        "Gus: Right. So, who needs her, you know?",
        "Beth: You do.",
        "Gus: No. (Laughs) no, I don'T.",
        "Beth: Gus. Gus, be honest. Why out of all the gin joints in springfield did you happen to come into this one, the coopers' place?",
        "Gus: Because I am tired of begging for her mercy and her family's mercy, and now I want them... I don't care if she'S... now I need her to see it.",
        "Beth: I'll give you credit. You talk a good game. But I don't believe you for a second.",
        "Gus: It's not a game. It's not. What are you... I'll prove it to you, all right? Let's blow this gin joint, let's go back to that hole that you found me in, and I'll buy you a couple of drinks. Let's go. What do you say?",
        "Phillip: Look, my plans for company have...",
        "Harley: Your \"plans.\" Well, that's a nice little euphemism.",
        "Phillip: Well, whatever you would like to call them. They have nothing to do with our custody arrangement, so let's not go backwards, okay?",
        "Harley: You attack us, and then you expect me to just welcome you into my home and hand over my child to you?",
        "Phillip: I'm not leaving without him.",
        "Harley: Then you'll be waiting a very long time.",
        "Zach: Daddy!",
        "Phillip: Hey. Come here, zach.",
        "Frank: Hey, zach. Do you know what? You should be getting ready for bed? It's getting late.",
        "Phillip: Come here, buddy. Yeah. How you doing? How you doing? You ready to go have dinner? You want to go to the beach and have something from that hot dog stand on the beach? That's his favorite place these days. What do you think? No? No? Where do you want to go?",
        "Zach: Company.",
        "Frank: Company. Well, there's a good choice. You got good taste there. It's a great restaurant, isn't it, phillip?",
        "Phillip: I'll have him back at the usual time.",
        "Harley: Uh-huh. This discussion isn't over, daddy.",
        "Phillip: It is for me, mommy. Come on.",
        "Harley: See you later, bug. Gee, phillip, thanks for stopping by. So good to see you, phillip.",
        "Frank: You know, if I still had my gun, you could fire a couple of rounds into there. You'd probably feel a whole lot better. I hate to say it, but the guy does have rights, and you really can't keep his son from him, so... (crash)",
        "Buzz: Ow! Damn.",
        "Frank: Dad? What happened?",
        "Harley: Are you all right?",
        "Buzz: I'm okay.",
        "Frank: What's going on? What happened? What broke?",
        "Harley: Hopefully that lamp.",
        "Frank: Oh, yeah. You wish. Pop, I'll help you. (Knocking at door)",
        "Olivia: Hi.",
        "Harley: Olivia. You just missed phillip.",
        "Olivia: I know. I just waited for him to leave.",
        "Harley: Oh. What's up?",
        "Olivia: You got a minute?",
        "Harley: Mm-hmm.",
        "Olivia: Bill told me that you're interested in working with us to bring down spaulding.",
        "Harley: Oh, yeah.",
        "Olivia: Yeah.",
        "Harley: You can count me in.",
        "Olivia: Actually, I'd rather not.",
        "Cassie: I am telling you the truth. I was on the phone with mrs. Chitwood and the kids. Here. Hit redial. Call them for yourself!",
        "Edmund: Jeffrey o'neill, cassie. You were talking to jeffrey o'neill!",
        "Cassie: I was not! Why would you think I was talking to jeffrey o'neill?",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, go ahead. Cry rape. Who do you think they're going to believe when I tell them otherwise, dinah? Hmm? I'm the district attorney. Are they going to believe the district attorney, or some psychopath who's on the run for murdering her fiance? Yeah. It's all over, sweetie. Besides, those aren't real cops out there anyway, are they?",
        "Dinah: No, I guess they're not, huh? What, are they the kind that come and get you, never to be seen again? Come close to me, I'll crack your head open.",
        "Jeffrey: Go ahead. You're whistling in the dark, sweetie. Who are you going to call, huh? Who's going to help you now? No one can save you now. These guys outside are just waiting for my signal to come in here.",
        "Cassie: Edmund, what is wrong with you? (Telephone ringing) why are you acting this way?",
        "Edmund: Answer the phone, cassie. It's jeffrey calling you back.",
        "Cassie: For the last time, i was not talking to jeffrey! (Sighs) hello? Hello? Is anybody there?",
        "Dinah: This is your precious cassie on the phone. Don't worry, she can't hear us, though.",
        "Cassie: Hello? Speak to me, please.",
        "Dinah: Not until I pick up my finger off the mute button, and then boy, oh, boy will she get an earful.",
        "Cassie: Hello?",
        "Jeffrey: Hang up the phone.",
        "Cop: O'neill?",
        "Cassie: Hello?",
        "Dinah: First of all, I think that cassie will be thrilled to hear my voice, and then once she learns that I've been impersonating her under your careful tutelage, and that you've been impersonating richard and enjoying every single moment of it...",
        "Cop: O'neill? Is everything okay in there?",
        "Dinah: Actually, I don't think she's going to sit too well with it. What are you going to do? You going to call off the dogs? Or am I going to talk to cassie here?",
        "Cassie: For the last time, hello.",
        "Danny: Michelle, I do believe that we will always find our way back to each other, but it's stupid to risk that when there's no need.",
        "Michelle: There is a need.",
        "Danny: I can'T... I'm not... I can't just let you go. That... that's ridiculous. It goes against every instinct that I have.",
        "Michelle: Where we are right now isn't working, danny. If I'm ever going to find my way back to you, I've got to... I've got to find who I am first.",
        "Danny: That's all this is about? Finding yourself?",
        "Michelle: Yes.",
        "Danny: Really? It's not about tony?",
        "Michelle: (Scoffs)",
        "Danny: It is, isn't it?",
        "Michelle: Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, no, it is. It is. It's all about tony.",
        "Olivia: I honestly don't think you can go head-to-head with the spauldings, and I don't mean that as a criticism. You're just... you're a very good person, harley, very decent.",
        "Harley: Yeah, well, you get hurt enough, and the decency gets pounded out of you.",
        "Olivia: People are going to get hurt. They will, innocent people. That's not going to bother you?",
        "Harley: No, it won'T.",
        "Olivia: You're on the rebound from gus, you've got your kids demanding your attention, harley's angels. Come on, something's got to give, and I don't want you compromising what bill and I are trying to do.",
        "Harley: Okay, you're right. You're right. I'll give up harley's angels. Will that satisfy you? Will that prove to you that I am serious about taking down the spauldings? Then I'll do it. Satisfied?",
        "Olivia: You're going to do that-- just throw it all away? You're going to give away something that means so much to you, leave your friends in the lurch?",
        "Harley: Give the woman a cigar.",
        "Olivia: When?",
        "Harley: Soon.",
        "Mel: Hey, I'm glad you're home.",
        "Olivia: No time like the present.",
        "Cassie: For the last time, hello.",
        "Dinah: Jeffrey? Do you tell your people to back off or do I invite cassie to the party?",
        "Jeffrey: Hold your fire! I'm sorry, you guys! It's a false alarm! Take it out of here. Go on, get out. Everything's all right here. Go! Go. Yeah, I got it.",
        "Cassie: That was weird.",
        "Edmund: He must have figured I was still in the room.",
        "Cassie: Oh, my god. For the last time, I was not on the phone with jeffrey o'neill, edmund.",
        "Edmund: Right. Obviously it was just some mysterious caller who decided not to say anything. Of course.",
        "Cassie: What have I done to make you so suspicious?",
        "Edmund: You mean besides the fact that you and o'neill have become completely inseparable?",
        "Cassie: Inseparable? I just rejected his help with this whole imposter business, and I took me and my kids and i moved us in here with you. God, you... what is wrong with you? It's like you're obsessed or something. I love you, edmund. I love you, okay? Would you please stop doubting that and believe it? What is going through your head?",
        "Edmund: I don't know. I don't know. I've got to go.",
        "Cassie: You can't leave!",
        "Edmund: I've got to get out of here.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, but that's not how you handle things!",
        "Edmund: (Hyperventilating)",
        "Dinah: You made the right decision, sending your people away. What's wrong, darling?",
        "Jeffrey: You never make things easy, do you?",
        "Dinah: Hey, I'll go. I will go. And I'll never come back, if that's what you want.",
        "Jeffrey: Too late. (Gunshot) Coming up on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Harley: Well, enjoy yourself, olivia, because that is the first and last time I jump through hoops for you. Partners?",
        "Cassie: Jeffrey. I got your all-clear message. What happened?",

        "Michelle: Yeah, yeah. You know, it is. It is about tony. It is, because tony's identity is not all caught up in who i used to be. He relates to me as I am now. He gets me, danny, in a way that you just don'T.",
        "Danny: He gets you? Please, michelle. All he's going to get you is in prison. Is that what you want?",
        "Michelle: I don't believe that tony is going to put me in that position.",
        "Danny: You don't know him.",
        "Michelle: I don't know you, either.",
        "Danny: But I'm your husband.",
        "Michelle: And he's your cousin, and he saved my life, and that's what I know.",
        "Danny: Right, exactly. Don't you understand that tony loves being in that position? He saved your life. Now he's backing you in this club, this restaurant.",
        "Michelle: Because he is my friend, which is more than I can say about you right now.",
        "Danny: Michelle, he's not your friend.",
        "Michelle: Look, it's really not about tony, okay? It's not. It's not even about you. This is about me needing to figure out who I am.",
        "Danny: It's all about you. What about robbie? You have a son, michelle.",
        "Michelle: That's not fair. Don't say that like that. I love that little boy.",
        "Danny: But you're leaving him? Have you even thought about what that's going to do to him?",
        "Michelle: Yes, I've thought about it. I've thought about it a lot. I've also thought about what it's doing to this little boy having a confused mess of a mother. I don't think that makes it any better. So I would like to sit down with robbie, with you, and explain it to him. And I'll spend as much time as i can with that little boy, because I want to be with him.",
        "Danny: Just not with me.",
        "Michelle: Right now, no.",
        "Beth: (Clears throat)",
        "Gus: All right, let's do it. One drink, ten drinks-- what do you say? Let's go.",
        "Beth: Gus, don't you see? This just proves that you're not over harley. That you would even think of propositioning me just shows how much pain you're in.",
        "Gus: Who's propositioning you? Who's propositioning you?",
        "Beth: Okay, then what would you call it?",
        "Gus: Whatever. A couple of friends having a drink.",
        "Beth: Or two, or three.",
        "Gus: Or ten. Yeah, big... fine. You know what? You want to stay here, we'll stay here. What do you want? I'll get you something.",
        "Beth: I want you to start dealing with what's going on and stop pulling me into it.",
        "Gus: I'll make this easy for you. You want red or white? White.",
        "Phillip: What do you want to eat? Is that what you want? Is that what you want? Hey. Look who's here.",
        "Beth: Hi. What are you guys doing here? Zach, kind of late for you to be up.",
        "Phillip: It's zach's night to hang out with his pop, so here we are. How do you get so messed up?",
        "Beth: And do you think that's wise, phillip?",
        "Phillip: Why wouldn't it be wise? Can we sit? Can we sit?",
        "Beth: Oh... yeah. Gosh, I don't know. Maybe because you're in the process of taking this place away from b-u-z-z and you're here, again.",
        "Phillip: (Sighs) hey, zach? Why don't you go grab that table over there, and I'll be there in two seconds, okay?",
        "Zach: I want a grandpa burger.",
        "Phillip: You want a grandpa burger. That's an awfully big snack this late at night. But okay, we'll do it, just for tonight. Go on, I'll be right there. What's wrong with me throwing b-u-z-z a little business before he closes up shop?",
        "Beth: Oh, gee. I don't know, phillip. Why don't you just order the salt-in- the-wounds special?",
        "Phillip: Whose side are you on? (Cell phone ringing) hang on a second. Hold that thought.",

        "Gus: Zach man! Hi, buddy. How are you? Hm? You miss me? Give me a little hug? Come on.",
        "Mel: Jude left harry the horse at our place this morning, and I know he has trouble sleeping without him.",
        "Harley: Thank you so much. Mel, I actually wanted to speak to you anyway about... something about harley's angels, actually. You know, this thing with gus has hit me pretty hard.",
        "Mel: Oh, I know. I'm sorry, honey.",
        "Harley: Thanks. And then there's this stuff that phillip is pulling with the eminent domain thing.",
        "Mel: Well, I told you, I will help you in any way that I can, pro bono.",
        "Harley: Thanks. Yeah, there's another way that you could help me-- you and blake, actually, who I will call. You guys could maybe hold down the fort at harley's angels for a while, while I take an indefinite leave of absence?",
        "Mel: Oh. Wow, I didn't see that one coming.",
        "Harley: Well, you know, things have been pretty slow there anyway, right? And of course, if something really big came up, I would try my hardest to help you guys out, but the truth is, I am... I'm overwhelmed.",
        "Mel: No, I totally understand. I was just kind of hoping to take a leave of absence myself, but... you know what? That can wait until you get back. Which will be?",
        "Harley: I don't know. I'm sorry.",
        "Mel: No. Honey, it's okay. It's okay. Blake and I will make it work, okay? You go take care of yourself, do what you have to do. Don't worry about us. Okay? Look, I've got to get back home. Rick is up with leah, and if i don't get back there, he's going to be having her up playing all night.",
        "Harley: (Laughs)",
        "Mel: Come here. You okay?",
        "Harley: Yes. Thank you for understanding.",
        "Mel: Please. You would do the same thing for me. Good night.",
        "Olivia: Good night.",
        "Mel: Take care.",
        "Harley: I'll call blake.",
        "Olivia: I have to say, that was nicely done.",
        "Harley: Well, enjoy yourself, olivia, because that is the first and last time I jump through hoops for you. Partners?",
        "Olivia: Partners.",
        "Dinah: You could have killed me.",
        "Jeffrey: I can kill you anytime I feel like it. I can send you down in a hail of bullets and call it self- defense. No one would even question it.",
        "Dinah: You would kill me in cold blood, after everything we've meant to each other?",
        "Jeffrey: I can and I will, if I ever lay eyes on you again. Is that clear?",
        "Dinah: Very.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, then what are you waiting for? Get out of here. (Sighs)",
        "Edmund: Sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Talk to me. Tell me what is going on, edmund. What are you thinking?",
        "Edmund: I don't know. I don'T... I don't know.",
        "Cassie: Something must have happened to make you so upset. Something must have triggered this suspicion in you.",
        "Edmund: I've been under a lot of pressure lately, cassie.",
        "Cassie: Pressure because of me? Because of this imposter business?",
        "Edmund: Well, yes, but it started before. It started the night of the festival, I think.",
        "Cassie: When I doubted you. Okay, edmund, look, I said I was sorry. I was so sorry, and if I could take it back, I would.",
        "Edmund: No, cassie, you don't have to. You don't have to. That's not about... that's behind us.",
        "Cassie: Is it?",
        "Edmund: Yes, it is. It is. It's behind us. That's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying, all that I'm saying is that that's when it started for me. ( Stammering): The thoughts, the confusion, and now, someone...",
        "Cassie: Tell me. Please, would you just tell me?",
        "Edmund: You know, it'S... it'S... it doesn't matter. It's not about... that's not it. The who, the what, the where: It's not it. It's me. I'm the problem. I'm the problem. So I just need to... I need to... to figure that one out. Alone.",
        "Cassie: Alone?",
        "Edmund: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: Edmund, I'm supposed to help you.",
        "Edmund: You can'T.",
        "Cassie: Edmund, come on.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, be patient, or... look, I'm going to go get myself a room, all right? I think that would be better.",
        "Cassie: No! I'll go. If you really want to be alone? Fine. I'll bunk with the kids. No, I'm not going to do that, because I'm not going to wake them up, and I don't want to upset them. I'll go to reva's, and I guess I'll just be back here in the morning before they wake up. I love you, edmund.",
        "Michelle: I just packed a few things. I figure I'll come back if i need any more.",
        "Danny: Where are you going to stay? With rick and mel?",
        "Michelle: No. I'm going to stay at the lighthouse, because I like it there, and I've spent a lot of time there already.",
        "Danny: Oh, that's where the chair is and the bar. Right, your little place to escape to.",
        "Michelle: I'll call you first thing in the morning, and then maybe we can arrange a time for us to sit down with robbie.",
        "Danny: We're keeping it low- key, and we're not making a big deal out of it. He's been through enough already.",
        "Michelle: Well, let's not make a big deal of any of this, okay? One day at a time, right?",
        "Danny: Do I have a choice? Look, I've never been really good at letting things go. I try, but that's not me.",
        "Michelle: Well, you're a good father, and you're a good husband. You have been a rock for me. You've been a safety net.",
        "Danny: But you don't need one, right? You can take care of yourself.",
        "Michelle: Well, we'll find out. It's kind of scary for me to be out there on my own, but I've got to do it.",
        "Danny: I guess so. Obviously. (Sighs) you'll be fine.",
        "Michelle: So will you.",
        "Gus: Sit down for a second. You mad at me?",
        "Zach: You were supposed to marry us.",
        "Gus: Yeah. I know. Well, I'm sad about that, too. Believe me, I really wanted to be your stepfather.",
        "Phillip: People are crazy.",
        "Beth: So depriving buzz of his livelihood wasn't enough? Now you're evicting people from their homes?",
        "Phillip: It's business, beth. Buzz is going to be well compensated. These tenants are going to be well compensated.",
        "Beth: Oh. So as long as you compensate people, it's okay to run roughshod over them. When did you become alan?",
        "Phillip: Oh, that's deep. You know, I think maybe I won't give any business to buzz tonight. I'll see you back at the house. Hey, pal. Change of plans. We're going to go back to the house, and cook's going to fix you a burger. All right? Gus, alan tells me that you're coming back to spaulding after all. Is that true?",
        "Gus: Uh, yeah, the legal department. You got a problem with that?",
        "Phillip: No, I don't have a problem with it, as long as you're clear where your loyalties lie.",
        "Gus: Mm-hmm.",
        "Phillip: Okay.",
        "Gus: All right.",
        "Phillip: I'll see you in the office in the morning. Say good night to uncle gus.",
        "Gus: Good to see you.",
        "Zach: Good night.",
        "Gus: Good night, good night.",
        "Beth: You sure you want to play on phillip's team?",
        "Harley: I think I'll leave the board room maneuverings to you and bill and just concentrate on what I do best.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, what you do best. What is that, again?",
        "Harley: It's relating to people who probably don't even show up on your radar, olivia-- people who can provide us with some very valuable information.",
        "Olivia: What people are you talking about?",
        "Harley: Well, for starters, the staff at the mansion.",
        "Olivia: The servants?",
        "Harley: Servants are people, too. They have eyes and ears. They see and hear everything that goes on in that house. They know everyone's schedules, and they have their own axes to grind.",
        "Olivia: Oh, harley, no, no. It's not going to work. It's not going to work. They're not going to say anything bad about the spauldings. They are too loyal.",
        "Harley: Mm-hmm. Well, then how come I know that you have an obsession about your bathtub temperature? And that if somebody shows up with a cappuccino for you, and they've sprinkled cinnamon on it instead of chocolate, whoo, boy, can you throw a hissy fit.",
        "Olivia: Which little weasel said that about me?",
        "Harley: I have my sources.",
        "Olivia: Have you thought about zach in all this? I mean, this could get very nasty.",
        "Harley: I am thinking about zach. I don't want him living under phillip's thumb his whole life. Don't you feel that way about emma?",
        "Olivia: All right. I'll be in touch. I hope this works out.",
        "Harley: It will. I know it will.",
        "Buzz: I've got a question. Have you lost your mind?",
        "Cassie: Jeffrey. I got your all-clear message. What happened?",
        "Jeffrey: The imposter took the bait. She showed up here tonight. She was the ringleader. We apprehended her without incident, and she's in custody.",
        "Cassie: You got her?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: This is great.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: This is great! Okay. Well, come on, let's go!",
        "Jeffrey: Hey, hey. Go? Go where?",
        "Cassie: To the police station. I want a piece of this nut-job. (Knock at door)",
        "Dinah: Thank goodness you're here. I've never been so scared in my life. Jeffrey just tried to kill me.",
        "Michelle: (Sighs)",
        "Michelle: (Sighs)",
        "Phillip: Wow, look at that. Look at that. This is your legacy, son. One day this whole town will belong to you-- not just one dinky little restaurant. One day. One day very soon.",
        "Beth: So I guess part of your duties in the spaulding legal department will be to help phillip slash and burn.",
        "Gus: Oh, please. Whatever.",
        "Beth: And destroy the coopers in the process.",
        "Gus: No, I would never do anything to hurt harley or her family. But I'm a little sick of this thing being held over my head. I mean, I made a mistake. I made one mistake, and if that's what they want to do, hold it over me, well, then who needs them?",
        "Beth: I'll say it again: You do.",
        "Buzz: You can't team up with olivia. The woman uses people. She has no scruples.",
        "Harley: I don't care. Just as long as it doesn't get in the way of me getting what i need.",
        "Buzz: Which is?",
        "Harley: To get the power away from phillip and the rest of that family. Hey, we are not going to feel safe and secure until we're rid of them. Don't you get that?",
        "Frank: So now you're going after the whole company?",
        "Harley: Why not? Yes.",
        "Buzz: You know how to run a company?",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Buzz: No idea?",
        "Harley: No ideas. But I know about people's weaknesses. I know how to make people look bad. I don't care... I don't care what happens to spaulding at the end of this thing, okay? I just want to make sure that their power has been scattered to the winds.",
        "Buzz: Have you told this to olivia? Because I have a feeling she would probably like to be the ceo.",
        "Harley: She can be the ceo. We'll deal with that later. Fine.",
        "Buzz: How does gus fit into your plans?",
        "Harley: Nowhere.",
        "Buzz: Nowhere?",
        "Harley: Nowhere. Gus had his chance to get on board, and he chose not to. That's fine. I say we go full steam ahead, and if he gets in the way, he'll wish he hadn'T.",
        "Dinah: Thank you.",
        "Edmund: So tell me what happened.",
        "Dinah: Jeffrey found me, and he's afraid I'm going to ruin his chances with cassie.",
        "Edmund: So he nearly kills you?",
        "Dinah: You don't believe me?",
        "Edmund: Well, forgive me, but it is a bit extreme.",
        "Dinah: Edmund, he fired a bullet right over my head. I've got proof. You want to hear? Listen to this.",
        "Jeffrey: I can kill you anytime I feel like it. I can send you down in a hail of bullets and call it self- defense. No one would even question it.",
        "Dinah: He is obsessed with cassie and he will do whatever it takes to get her for himself. And I think it's working.",
        "Cassie: Is this where you got her? In here? In this room?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: Did she resist?",
        "Jeffrey: No, not much.",
        "Cassie: Did you ask her why she did this? Why she did this to me and she picked me, of all people? Did you ask her that?",
        "Jeffrey: I'm sorry, no.",
        "Cassie: Well, are you going to ask her, you or whoever is going to interrogate her? Are you going to find this out?",
        "Jeffrey: I don't know what to say.",
        "Cassie: Did she do this to you?",
        "Jeffrey: This... it's nothing.",
        "Cassie: I have something for that.",
        "Jeffrey: Come on, it's nothing. Everything is fine.",
        "Cassie: It doesn't make sense to me, okay? It doesn't make sense. It's one thing for someone to use your credit cards. It's another thing for someone to take your life, jeffrey. Why did she do this to me?",
        "Jeffrey: We don't know. We might never know, okay? From what I saw, she's a very, very troubled person, cassie.",
        "Dinah: I'm sorry I burst in here, but I'm scared.",
        "Edmund: No, no, I'm glad you came. If I ever thought jeffrey o'neill was harmless, i certainly don't now.",
        "Cassie: It's so scary, you know?",
        "Jeffrey: I know.",
        "Cassie: I mean, to think that someone can just violate your life like that, and to come in here and... to come in here where your kids are, it's just so scary.",
        "Jeffrey: You've been through a lot. But it's over. It's over. It's over now.",
        "Cassie: (Sobs)",
        "Dinah: Do you have an idea of where I can stay this evening? It has to be a place that jeffrey wouldn't think to look for me.",
        "Edmund: Stay. Stay here.",
        "Dinah: No, I couldn't, edmund.",
        "Edmund: You'll be safe here. You will. You'll be safe.",
        "Dinah: Okay. Thank you. Thank you. I don't know what I would do without you.",
        "Cassie: Thank you. I don't know what I would do without you. Next, on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Michelle: It's actually perfect timing, while danny needs to raise money by selling the house.",
        "Tony: No, that's okay. I'll take care of it.",
        "Michelle: How?",
        "Tony: It's tony. That account in caymans, I need you to close it now. I need the cash."
