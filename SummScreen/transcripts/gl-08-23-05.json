        "Lizzie: What do you mean you got married? How could you do that? You weren't even seeing anybody. You weren't even going to discuss it with me?",
        "Beth: You want to be a part of a family decision, Lizzie, you have to behave like you're a part of the family. You're out on your own. You weren't at home. There wasn't time to consult you.",
        "Lizzie: You couldn't even have made a phone call?",
        "Beth: It happened very quickly.",
        "Lizzie: I don't get it. I don't get how you could just go off and marry some complete stranger.",
        "Beth: I didn't marry a stranger. I married your grandfather.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: All right, Alan, I'm here. So, what's the problem? Is it a second opinion that you want? If it's that, then I'm sorry, I'm the wrong person.",
        "Alan: Stop the game, Rick. You know damn well why I invited you here.",
        "Rick: ( Snaps fingers ) It's about Phillip, isn't it?",
        "Alan: I don't know what kind of game you're playing, but I'm here to tell you right now, it is not going to work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: The lawyers are lying to me. About what, I don't know, but it doesn't smell good. \"Lawyer\" and \"liar\"-- those words just sound too alike. ( Yawns ) Edmund, it's me. I'm heading on to the farmhouse, okay, so I'm going to be there in a little bit. ( Sighs ) Oh, God. I just need to focus. I need to focus. ( Car starting ) Get on that couch so I can rest. I just want to pass out. ( Car crashes ) Who did you have to bribe to get a driver's license? Oh, God. Why don't you open your eyes when you drive? This is all your fault. I've got to call the cops and make a report.",
        "Mallet: Don't bother, Ms. Marler. They're already here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: You know, Michelle, I think finding a way to let go of Cassie may be the hardest thing I've ever done, so the prospect of facing a future without Danny... well, let's just say I think I... I think I understand a little piece of what you may be going through.",
        "Michelle: Sounds like you do understand.",
        "Edmund: Yeah. Yeah. But, you know, sometimes I think the healthiest thing one can do in a situation like this is just... ( inhales ) ...take a deep breath and move on. And the only thing you should be worrying about is delivering a healthy, happy baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Let me just go inside and make sure everything is under control in the restaurant.",
        "Danny: Okay.",
        "Marina: I'll grab us some food and then I'm yours for the rest of the night.",
        "Danny: That sounds very good to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: You know, more importantly, I really think I should...",
        "Edmund: Hide.",
        "Michelle: What?",
        "Edmund: Hide. Just do as I'm saying. Just do as I'm saying. Hurry. Now.",
        "Edmund: Danny. Excellent! You're just the man I needed to see. You have a few minutes?",
        "Danny: Uh, no. Not really.",
        "Marina: Don't worry about it. I'll just meet you inside, okay?",
        "Edmund: Thank you so much. I won't keep him too long, I promise.",
        "Marina: No problem.",
        "Danny: ( Clears throat ) So, what's up, Edmund?",
        "Edmund: Well, I understand there's a townhouse for sale on Fifth Street. Cassie and I are... well, Cassie filed for divorce, and so I need another place to stay.",
        "Danny: Oh. Oh, I didn't know. That's tough.",
        "Edmund: Yes, yes. But I suppose all one can really do in a situation like this is just take a deep breath and move. That's what you and Michelle seem to have done. Try not to look back.",
        "Danny: Yeah. Yeah, pretty much. So just, why don't you give me a call in the morning and I'll see if I can get those specs for the townhouse to you, okay?",
        "Edmund: Thank you. Thank you, Danny. I appreciate it.",
        "Danny: Yeah. Sure.",
        "Edmund: Michelle? Are you all right? You suddenly seem pale.",
        "Michelle: I'm fine. It's just... sometimes the truth hurts.",
        "Edmund: Yeah. Yeah. Most of the time, from my experience. Well, I'm glad I spotted them.",
        "Michelle: Me, too. Thank you.",
        "Edmund: Sure. Look, why don't we get you out of here before Danny comes back? I just need to see Dinah. She's inside. I'll be right back. All right, Dinah, that sedative I gave you should keep you out of commission at least until... Dinah? Oh, terrific.",
        "Dinah: I should've known. You give the guy a badge, he drives the streets like he owns them.",
        "Mallet: Holy... ( Laughs ) What are you doing? Well, that's just great. We're not on the road. We're in a parking garage, and you just smashed into me? You just hit me, lady. Oh, no, don't tell me. You've been drinking, right? You've been drinking? Oh, that's just great. A pregnant woman who's drinking and driving. You know what? Not even your daddy the mayor's going to get you out of this one.",
        "Dinah: I'm not drinking.",
        "Mallet: ( Scoffs )",
        "Dinah: I will walk a fine line for you, okay? Look. ( Hums ) Okay? Why don't you lighten up, Mr. Officer?",
        "Mallet: Detective. That's Detective.",
        "Dinah: Oh, okay. So I assume now that that makes you even cooler. The point is, nobody got hurt, okay? I'm just saying that if I were to run into somebody-- figuratively...",
        "Mallet: Literally. Literally ran into me.",
        "Dinah: I'm saying that I'm glad it was you. Mm-hmm.",
        "Mallet: Really? Why is that?",
        "Dinah: Because of your fine reputation for saving a poor woman in distress. Like moi?",
        "Mallet: Forget it. I'm out of the saving distressed damsel business.",
        "Dinah: Oh. Well, in that case, let's just do one for the road?",
        "Mallet: Why don't you stay off the road and then we'll all be happy, okay? I'm not in the mood for a rescue, here. I'm more in the mood for \"let's trade insurance numbers now.\"",
        "Dinah: All right, why don't you just admit it, that you are in a foul mood, ever since this morning when a particular wedding took place where you're not the groom?",
        "Mallet: Does it show, Dinah? Hm? Does all of the torment of knowing that Harley and Gus exchanged vows, does that show? Well, then thank God that I ran into you, because there is nothing better than getting advice on both love and marriage from someone that's unwed and pregnant, and who's an ex-con. So, I'm just going to sit here. This is great. I'm all ears, so please give me advice. I'm all ears. Please, hit me. I meant that figuratively, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: You and Edmund trade old divorce stories?",
        "Danny: No. No. Actually, we talked briefly about moving on and not looking back. I think maybe a little visual aid might have helped drive the point home. You know, something kind of, sort of like this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Don't tell me to lower my voice! I should see if they'll lock you up with granddad. You're as crazy as he is!",
        "Coop: What the hell is going on?",
        "Marina: Good luck.",
        "Danny: Yeah, you'll need it.",
        "Coop: Thanks. Oh, boy.",
        "Beth: Don't talk to me that way, young lady.",
        "Lizzie: He killed my dad and then you marry him? You expect me to be polite?",
        "Beth: Alan is your grandfather.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, I don't care. He's also a murderer and he's a nut job, and deserves to be locked away. Oh, just the thought of you two together. Ugh. I don't know whether I should yell or throw up or cry. I don't know.",
        "Beth: What Alan and I have is different.",
        "Lizzie: I don't want to hear it. Mom, I don't want to hear it. I don't want to think it. I don't want to see it when I close my eyes.",
        "Beth: Then open them, Lizzie. Open them and look at me.",
        "Lizzie: I can't.",
        "Beth: Try to accept that I have a good reason for what I'm doing. I'm running the family now and I plan on making it a home that you'll be proud to come home to, where you'll be proud of your life and your family, and you'll stop wishing you were somebody else. You'll stop pretending.",
        "Lizzie: You did this for me? That was a bad decision because I'm never coming back there. Do you hear me? Do you hear me? There's not a thing you can do to make me change my mind.",
        "Beth: Really?",
        "Lizzie: What's that?",
        "Beth: A blank check. Fill in whatever amount you'd like. It's your decision. Never say never, Lizzie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: I know that you exhumed Phillip's grave.",
        "Rick: Of course you'd know, Alan. You signed the order. Although I understand that you didn't know it at the time.",
        "Alan: I would've done it anyway. I wanted them to look, Rick. I just didn't know you would do it.",
        "Rick: Well, hey, listen, Alan, I can understand why you're upset.",
        "Alan: Oh, really? You can, huh?",
        "Rick: Sure. You heard that my report confirmed that Phillip was inside the Spaulding grave, and you've maintained all along that he was alive. So, obviously this is very painful for you, and that's why you're in this place, Alan.",
        "Alan: Why are you saying all of these things? Why are you doing this?",
        "Rick: Doing what, Alan?",
        "Alan: Rick...",
        "Rick: Doing what?",
        "Alan: Rick, listen to me. You are Phillip's best friend in the world. Why are you going around trying to tell everyone he's dead when you know he is alive!",
        "Rick: You keep talking like this... you keep talking like this... you keep talking like this, Alan, I guarantee you will never leave this place. Do you understand me?",
        "Alan: You can't do that.",
        "Rick: It's already done, Alan. It's done. After all, I think this is what your son would really want.",
        "Alan: What makes you think that Phillip wants me locked up? Have you been talking with him?",
        "Rick: Oh, yeah. All the time. Well, you know, one-way conversations, like you have with yourself in this room. It's like you said, Alan, he was my best friend and I miss him.",
        "Alan: We both know he was not in that casket.",
        "Rick: Read the report. You've got a lot of time on your hands. Read it. I'll send you a copy.",
        "Alan: Go on. Enjoy yourself. I'll bide my time right here. I can take care my outside interests from right inside this hospital room.",
        "Rick: That's great, Alan. Whatever makes you happy.",
        "Alan: Well, that's funny that you should mention happiness, because I have not been this happy in quite a while.",
        "Rick: Really. Well, what makes you happy, Alan?",
        "Alan: Aren't you going to congratulate the groom? After all, you know the bride very well.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Why are you doing this?",
        "Beth: Because I know you, and I love you just the way you are. But you're a Spaulding, and trying to live like the Coopers, you'll only get hurt. You're not built for it.",
        "Lizzie: But I won't be alone. And if I get hurt...",
        "Beth: You'll make trouble for anyone who tries to help you.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, right. Like Coop.",
        "Beth: Lizzie, come home to stay and that check is yours. I just want you to be happy.",
        "Coop: Ladies. Is everything okay here?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, yeah. Just another typical Spaulding day. Mom's trying to buy me to keep me away from you.",
        "Beth: Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: But I didn't tell her about my new job.",
        "Beth: What?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. I'm WSPR's newest employee.",
        "Beth: And what will you be doing there?",
        "Lizzie: Something very important.",
        "Coop: Yes. She will. Eventually.",
        "Beth: But for a very long time, you'll be making important coffee and copies and earning a salary that... well, it would take you years to make what you could have in a matter of seconds. I'm making you a wonderful offer.",
        "Lizzie: No, you're trying to take away everything I tried to do on my own. Don't you think I knew what I was giving up when I left the house? I mean, don't you remember, you and dad gave up everything to be with each other. I mean, obviously money wasn't an issue, but there were other things. You wanted to get married...",
        "Beth: Elizabeth Lillian Spaulding, you are not even thinking about marriage.",
        "Lizzie: It's none of your business. I'm of age.",
        "Coop: Whoa, Lizzie hold on.",
        "Beth: Of age? Barely.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, you're questioning my judgment? You, who went off and married dear, old crazy granddad?",
        "Beth: Look...",
        "Lizzie: No, you look. And listen. I'm not talking to you about this. Leave me alone.",
        "Coop: Ms. Raines, I'm sorry, but Lizzie's priceless.",
        "Beth: Well, that is something we agree on, Henry. But it's Mrs. Spaulding now. Remember that. Mrs. Alan Spaulding.",
        "Coop: Oh my God. She...",
        "Lizzie: Coop, don't. Don't say it, please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: If you didn't look like a Macy's balloon, maybe I wouldn't have to be so nice to you.",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs ) That's you being nice?",
        "Mallet: Yeah. Yeah, usually when someone runs into my car and takes a swing at me, they usual don't get off so easily.",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs )",
        "Mallet: Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Marler, where are you going? Where are you going?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: What? Wow. You finished your burger already?",
        "Marina: Yes. I was starving. It's hard work being a bridesmaid.",
        "Danny: Yeah, I can tell.",
        "Marina: And wearing this dress.",
        "Danny: Still, there's just something indescribable about a beautiful girl in a beautiful dress on a hot summer night with a stray drop of ketchup...",
        "Marina: What? Where?",
        "Danny: No, no, no. Don't move. Don't move. A very sexy girl with a little drop right here at the corner of her very sexy lips.",
        "Marina: Turns you on, doesn't it? ( Laughs )",
        "Danny: Everything about you does. What about you?",
        "Marina: Well, the look in your eye is working for me. So, you promised me a night out. You got anything planned?",
        "Danny: I don't know. I have a lot of ideas. Why don't we just see where the night takes us? How about that?",
        "Marina: Okay. Danny?",
        "Danny: Mm-hmm.",
        "Marina: How about we let the night take us back to your place?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: You know, you really don't have to do this.",
        "Edmund: I just want to help, Michelle. Sit down for a minute. You don't have to worry about being spotted or hiding or answering questions. Nothing.",
        "Michelle: All right, but you seem to have your hands full with Dinah.",
        "Edmund: She's perfectly fine. You don't have to worry about her. Now, please, just get off your feet.",
        "Michelle: You don't think you should look for her?",
        "Edmund: I'm sure Cassie has taken her back to the farm already. Besides, really, don't spend any more energy worrying about Dinah.",
        "Michelle: It must be a wonderful feeling to know that you're protected and taken care of and that the baby you're carrying is wanted.",
        "Edmund: You know, I've spent so much time taking care of Dinah, I think I have a rough, at least, understanding of how hard it is for a woman who's expecting. But you've done this all on your own, Michelle. All your own with minimal comfort. Well, I just... I admire you more than I can possibly say, and whatever I can do to help you get through this, I'd appreciate it.",
        "Michelle: And what do you mean by that?",
        "Edmund: Well, let's start with a glass of water. A glass of water, and then I'm going to call room service and order us up a feast. You have to eat, keep up your energy.",
        "Michelle: Wow. I think I like this side of you, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Well, I think impending fatherhood has really changed me.",
        "Michelle: You know, it changed Danny a lot, too. After Robbie was born, he was... ( groans )",
        "Edmund: Michelle?",
        "Michelle: I just... I have to stop doing this. I have to stop. Danny has moved on and it's over, and I have to stop talking about him like he's still mine.",
        "Edmund: Danny thinks you've moved on. And yet here you are, still in love with him even, and maybe even carrying another man's child.",
        "Michelle: You know what? I need to splash some cold water on my face. Is that all right?",
        "Edmund: Sure, sure. Be my guest. Right here. You know, I really want you to know that I'm here to protect you, Michelle. Take care of you, carte blanche, anything you need, anything the baby needs.",
        "Michelle: That's very nice.",
        "Edmund: Let me protect you, Michelle. Let me protect both of you.",
        "Michelle: Really?",
        "Edmund: I promise. You won't regret it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Okay. All right. Close your eyes. What the... why is this?",
        "Marina: Danny.",
        "Danny: Yeah, well, I called ahead. I wanted tonight to be special.",
        "Marina: It's wonderful.",
        "Danny: Good, I'm glad you like it. You want some champagne?",
        "Marina: No.",
        "Danny: No?",
        "Marina: No.",
        "Danny: Okay. Well, I just want you to feel comfortable.",
        "Marina: Oh, I am.",
        "Danny: Good. Well, what can I do?",
        "Marina: Well...",
        "Danny: Can I do anything?",
        "Marina: Yes. You could help me with this zipper.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: So, you must be due fairly soon.",
        "Michelle: Yeah I am.",
        "Edmund: And no one else knows?",
        "Michelle: Well, a few people. My brother. And Bill and Olivia. I've been staying there since I've been back. But I'm not going to stay there much longer because they definitely need their space. I don't know, I think I must've been crazy coming back here thinking I could be here and still keep this baby a secret.",
        "Edmund: Well, you can if you really want to.",
        "Michelle: How?",
        "Edmund: Stay here. As long as you like.",
        "Michelle: In your suite?",
        "Edmund: Sure. I'll be staying out at the farm, taking care of Dinah, taking care of the baby after it's born. And you can be here with whatever you need.",
        "Michelle: You'd do that?",
        "Edmund: Sure. As I said, I think I'm pretty paternal these days.",
        "Michelle: I don't know, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Really, just... just think about it. I can give you a spare key. You can come and go as you like. You can stay as long as you like. And your secret's safe with me. No one will know you're here unless... ( Knocking at the door )",
        "Michelle: Who's that?",
        "Edmund: Probably just the front desk with mail or something. So just relax, sit here and I'll take care of everything. Okay, I'm coming, I'm coming. Can I help you?",
        "Dinah: I have a feeling you can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: My step-granddad. Oh, wow, and my mom's going to be my step- grandmother. Oh.",
        "Coop: Hey, whoa, whoa. Are you okay? All right. Hey, look, it's me, Dr. Bradshaw. Just relax. Breathe, that's what Rick said, right? Okay.",
        "Lizzie: I need some water.",
        "Coop: Water, yeah. Okay, hold on one sec.",
        "Lizzie: Fizzy; imported, please.",
        "Coop: What else?",
        "Lizzie: All these years I thought that I was the crazy one.",
        "Coop: All right. Here we go. Lizzie, I need you to drink this, drink it slowly, all right? Here.",
        "Lizzie: You know what, Coop? It was them, Coop. It was the grownups. They were the crazy ones, not me. That's why I always felt so alone.",
        "Coop: You're not alone, all right? Not anymore.",
        "Lizzie: You're right, I'm not alone.",
        "Coop: All right, look. This is your chance-- this is your time to start a brand new life outside of that house and away from those people.",
        "Lizzie: But those people are my parents, my family. Why? Why is this happening? I mean, no money, no home. My mom married my grandfather who killed my father. It's like one of those plays where everybody's walking around in tights and bathrobes.",
        "Coop: Okay, okay. All right. Shh. I understand you're upset, but look. Things will get better. It might seem like the world is ending right now, but things will get better. Trust me. You have to trust me.",
        "Coop: There you go. That's a good start.",
        "Lizzie: It's just the beginning of the war.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Oh, but don't worry, Rick, you have a whole year before you have to send us a gift. My, this ring is beautiful, isn't it? It belonged to my father.",
        "Rick: So you're telling me, Alan, you got married in this place today?",
        "Alan: Yes. Well, I'm sorry you didn't get an invitation. We were so excited, we couldn't wait. We were just crazy in love, I guess.",
        "Rick: Good for you, Alan. I'm very happy that you found a patient-- I'm assuming it's woman to share your life with. My only hope is that she doesn't notice that the only person you could possibly love is yourself.",
        "Alan: Well, she's not a patient.",
        "Rick: Come on! We both know that no woman in her right mind would ever marry you except for the money and even that's a stretch.",
        "Alan: You'd be surprised.",
        "Rick: Oh, I doubt that.",
        "Beth: Hi, honey, I'm...",
        "Rick: Beth?",
        "Beth: ...Home.",
        "Alan: Sweetheart, look who paid me an unexpected visit, huh?",
        "Rick: This is a joke right, Beth? Tell me this isn't true.",
        "Beth: I take it Alan has told you our good news.",
        "Alan: It's wonderful, isn't it, Rick?",
        "Rick: That's not the word I was looking for. Beth, stop it. You're kidding, right?",
        "Beth: I know how this looks.",
