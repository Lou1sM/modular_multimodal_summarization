        "Mel: (Clears throat) Oh, well you're going to bed early.",
        "Rick: Don't you look pretty. Actually, it is not early. Your daughter has the remote downstairs and I am just too embarrassed to ask her what she is watching.",
        "Mel: Rick Bauer, tragically unhip.",
        "Rick: That's me.",
        "Rick: Hipster Rickster, that sounds like a song.",
        "Mel: At least you're spending some time with your daughter.",
        "Rick: We are getting some good time together. You know she's growing up so fast. It's unbelievable really.",
        "Mel: Mm-hm.",
        "Rick: Hey, listen, I need to ask you a favor.",
        "Mel: What's that?",
        "Rick: Um, I need to sleep in the bed tonight. That ok?",
        "Mel: Uh, yeah, yeah you know, you've been on the couch for awhile now..",
        "Rick: You... you can do your reading in here if you want.",
        "Mel: Okay. Um, so sleep together in the bed?",
        "Rick: Yeah. It kind of would be nice.",
        "Mel: Okay.",
        "Weather announcer: So tomorrow expect plenty of sunshine with normal highs. There might be a cloud or two, but, all in all, a beautiful day.",
        "Rick: I love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mel: What is all this?",
        "Rick: Meaning, when I was a kid, whenever there was some little issue going on with the family, my grandma Bert used to get everybody together for this real big meal.",
        "Mel: Food is not going to solve our problems.",
        "Rick: It's not the food, do you know, as a family. My grandmother was right, it didn't matter what the issue was, when family sat at the dinner table and pass food around, people found a way to talk about their problems. So how much longer are we just going to keep up this act? We need to find someway to connect, Melissande, some way.",
        "Mel: Melissande? Wow, you haven't used my full name in a long time.",
        "Rick: That's because I'm just trying to get your attention.",
        "Mel: Well, I don't have time for a big breakfast, I'm sorry.",
        "Rick: Fine. My hearing is this afternoon at the hospital, I'm assuming that you would be there.",
        "Mel: In a official capacity?",
        "Rick: No. I don't want a lawyer there, I would really like to have my wife.",
        "Mel: I'm sorry.",
        "Rick: If you are going to divorce me, just get on with it.",
        "Mel: Is that what you want?",
        "Rick: No! I don't want that. But I don't want a pretend marriage anymore, Mel. I don't want the silences and the stares and not touching each other. I don't know what that is supposed to be. But I can't live with it anymore. I just can't. I really was hoping that getting reinstated to my job would be a small step to rebuilding our marriage. I was hoping that starting today that I could have my wife by my side, not a roommate.",
        "Mel: I'm sorry, it's not that easy.",
        "Rick: I know. But how many times do I have to say I'm sorry? How many times do I have to say it?",
        "Mel: Rick, you lied to me, okay? You kept a part of you, a huge part of you hidden from me. Now, Ross is dead, Blake lost a husband, Dinah lost a father, and Beth and Alan... don't you see how twisted this is? How sad and bizarre?",
        "Rick: None of those people opposed my reinstatement. In fact, all three of those women have found a way to forgive me. But my own wife, the one who has the least reason, can...",
        "Mel: The least! Yes, great. Maybe I'm sick and tired of being the least in your life!",
        "Rick: You know what, you're twisting my words again! (Door slams)",
        "Bert: I'm so blessed with a wonderful family and wonderful friends. To have that feeling of love coming at you from everybody. It gives you the strength to do almost anything.",
        "Rick: We do, we have a wonderful family, don't we?",
        "Bert: Yeah, I think we do..",
        "Rick: Hey.",
        "Leah: Wow, that's a lot of food.",
        "Rick: Yeah. You're dad was just hoping that... it doesn't make any difference anymore. So where have you been?",
        "Leah: Jogging. I bought some bagels on the way home. I know you have that big meeting at the hospital today, so I thought we could all eat together.",
        "Rick: I love the way you think, sweetie. I love the way you think.",
        "Leah: Is mom already gone?",
        "Rick: I hope not, honey. I hope not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mel: Hi. Hi, I'm Dr. Bauer.",
        "Mother: And I'm about to have a baby. How are you doing?",
        "Mel: Not bad.",
        "Mother: Can I wait until my husband gets here? I wanted to wait.",
        "Mel: Well, the baby may have other ideas. What have we got.",
        "Nurse: The contractions are two minutes along, five minutes apart.",
        "Mel: Okay, well that's not too bad.",
        "Mother: You mean this gets worse? I thought this was kind of it and the baby comes out.",
        "Mel: Let's just say it gets a little more intense.",
        "Mother: Really? Oh, oh, oh, like that? That was so... oh, my God.",
        "Mel: You want an epidural?",
        "Mother: Nothing until my husband comes.",
        "Mel: Okay, well, you better hold my hand, then.",
        "Nurse: You did it! You did it!",
        "Rick: Yes, honey, you did it!",
        "Nurse: You've got a beautiful baby!",
        "Mother: Dr. Bauer, Dr. Bauer, it is coming! I don't want it to come yet. My husband... did somebody call?",
        "Mel: Well, the baby is calling the shots, even if he doesn't come, we can do this.",
        "Father: Honey!",
        "Mother: Oh. I've been waiting for you. Darling, the baby's coming.",
        "Father: I know.",
        "Mother: I couldn't do this without you. I don't want to do anything without you.",
        "Mel: Page Dr. Sedwick into labor and delivery. I need to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Leah: Just let me talk to Dr. Grant.",
        "Rick: I have to get my job back by myself.",
        "Leah: Any Bauer battle is my battle.",
        "Rick: And you know something? You are a very loyal young lady.",
        "Leah: I'm not the only one. I bet you mom would be there, too.",
        "Rick: Yeah. You know what I don't get about you?",
        "Leah: How I'm so smart for someone so young?",
        "Rick: Yeah, exactly. You know something? You've got a swim practice in 15 minutes, young lady, so you better get going.",
        "Leah: I've got your back, Dad.",
        "Rick: I know you do, sweetheart. I love you.",
        "Lillian: Right before our very eyes.",
        "Rick: Gosh.",
        "Lillian: She has grown up.",
        "Rick: I know. She is going to be in high school before I know it.",
        "Lillian: Oh.",
        "Rick: That's okay, she can find a group of friends like I had with Beth and Mindy and...",
        "Lillian: And Phillip.",
        "Rick: Yes. I just think about all of the times, and that was some of the best times of my life.",
        "Lillian: Oh, Rick.",
        "Rick: What?",
        "Lillian: I love a trip down memory lane, too, but that's not how I remember it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mel: That's not exactly how I remember things with this patient, but I can check my records and get back to you.",
        "Brian: You know what? I'm running late for a meeting right now. But I do have to eat. Can you meet me at Company in a little while? We'll go over it then? I'll buy?",
        "Mel: Yeah, okay.",
        "Brian: Okay.",
        "Mel: Beth, do you have a minute?",
        "Beth: Sure.",
        "Mel: I wanted to talk to you about Rick. You are throwing your support behind him to get his job back, and I just want to know why?",
        "Beth: Aren't you relieved?",
        "Mel: How could you do it, how can you forgive him for what he has done?",
        "Beth: Isn't it obvious, I'm surprised that you even have to ask.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lillian: Why are you so surprised?",
        "Rick: I never thought I would hear you say that. Beth, Mindy, Phillip and I were so close, we loved each other and... well, not to get so romantic...",
        "Lillian: Romantic, you thought you were the musketeers. That's very romantic, Rick.",
        "Rick: Lillian, is it me or are you mocking my youth?",
        "Lillian: Well, like all young kids, you thought you were the center of the universe. Maybe you were the center of the universe. Look at your parents. Mindy thought she was the princess because of Billy. Phillip thought he was the prince because of Alan. And your father, he had all of the hope in the world for you. And Beth... Beth, she was my everything.",
        "Rick: Lillian, and don't get me wrong, I know there were some difficulties, but I'm just saying, when I think about the past and how much those friendships meant to me, it just fills me with something I haven't been able to find anywhere else in my life.",
        "Lillian: You haven't found that something even with Mel or with your children?",
        "Rick: Well, that's different. I like the other guy better, a lot better. I like the way I used to feel with my friends. What they meant to me, how they understood me, and truth be told, I really, really miss what I meant to them, Lillian. And that's long, long gone. So there you have it, that's my confession for the day. I guess dreams aren't supposed to come true.",
        "Lillian: I don't know, Rick. Maybe they don't come true, but maybe reality is much better. I mean, how many men in the world would love to trade places with you and have this beautiful, devoted wife like Mel?",
        "Rick: Yeah, I know.",
        "Lillian: So why are you living in the past?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Rick is my friend, Mel. That's why I forgave him.",
        "Mel: That's it?",
        "Beth: You have to understand what Rick and I have is unique. You have to understand that time in our lives...",
        "Mel: Yes, I know, the four musketeers. I know. I know how tragic the friendship was, and I know how beautiful, and how wonderful...",
        "Mel: You don't have to be quite so dismissive.",
        "Mel: Well, why do you over romanticize what you guys had? It is over 20 years ago. It's ridiculous.",
        "Beth: I think you're missing the point.",
        "Mel: No. The point is we all have friends, good pals, buddies. I'm so sick of hearing about you and Phillip in high school and how Rick and Mindy were destined for each other. Oh, wait, turn the page of the comic book, and there's that tragic switcheroo where you all decide to give in to curiosity and cheat on each other.",
        "Beth: It wasn't just that simple.",
        "Mel: Oh, please come on. Ask anybody who watches reality TV every week. People do it all of the time. They cheat. So you're wonderful friendship that you think was so great was based on lies and disloyalty and pain. And Rick, he holds it up like a trophy, higher than anything he has ever held up. You know what? It's just sad. It was a mistake talking to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mel: Hey. No, please sit down. I'm sorry I'm late. Am I late?",
        "Brian: Not at all. I just got here. Thanks for meeting me in the first place. I really needed to get out of the hospital. >From the looks of it, you did, too.",
        "Mel: I'm sorry. I just had a run-in I didn't want to have or...",
        "Brian: You don't look like the type to spoil for a fight. But then again, you're a lawyer, and a doctor. Oh, did I mention she was a lawyer?",
        "Mel: I get that a lot. I finally stop telling people.",
        "Brian: I'm new here, but I think the cat is out of the bag.",
        "Mel: So you're from?",
        "Brian: Ohio, but originally from Chicago.",
        "Mel: How do you like my little slice of heaven here?",
        "Brian: Is it me or does everyone know everyone else?",
        "Waitress: Hi, Mel. Wait will you have.",
        "Brian: Two buzz burgers and two glasses of the Australian shiraz. Am I overstepping? Too early for wine?",
        "Mel: No, it's just the wine that you ordered...",
        "Brian: I remembered. We were at a meeting, and you mentioned how much you liked the wine. I'm not the kind of guy who forces his opinions on the woman he's out with.",
        "Mel: Out with? Brian, are we out on a date?",
        "Brian: If you have to ask, maybe I'm being too subtle.",
        "Mel: No, I like subtle and thoughtful.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Rick, I take it that Mel isn't going to be at your hearing.",
        "Rick: Do you know something I don't know?",
        "Beth: I know she hates your past and everything it stands for.",
        "Rick: So what does that mean?",
        "Beth: Mel and I had... well, I wouldn't call it a chat.",
        "Rick: About what?",
        "Beth: She wants to know how I could forgive you and testify on your behalf. Rick, she's your wife. She shouldn't have to ask me.",
        "Rick: She's... she's doing what she thinks is best.",
        "Beth: And doing what's best doesn't include being at your side for what could be the end of your career at this hospital?",
        "Rick: Clearly, she hasn't reconciled with what I did, okay?",
        "Beth: I got that.",
        "Rick: So do me a favor, cut her a little slack. I tell you, in many ways, she is much more of a Bauer than I can ever dream of being.",
        "Beth: Okay. Whatever. I just wanted to tell you that I spoke to Dr. Grant and told him that I think you should be reinstated.",
        "Rick: Thank you.",
        "Beth: You're welcome. You've always stood by me, and I should stand by you, no matter what you do. That's what comes from knowing somebody so long, for having a friend for life.",
        "Rick: Is there something wrong with that?",
        "Beth: Well, I don't think so, but, you know, obviously your wife does.",
        "Rick: Don't talk about my wife. Your mother gave me an earful, an absolute earful.",
        "Beth: About what?",
        "Rick: She agrees with my wife. She thinks we idolize the past. I mean, she laughed at the whole four musketeers things. She laughed out loud. She did. She thinks there is nothing separating us from the other teenagers we grew up with. Nothing.",
        "Beth: Well, you know what? It was special to us. Beyond that, what else does it matter?",
        "Rick: Beth, I really quite honestly think it does matter because the people we care about are saying we can't get past it.",
        "Beth: Are we trying to get past it? I didn't know that we were doing that.",
        "Rick: I don't know. I'm starting to think that I should try.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mel: Brian, you know, this is...",
        "Brian: Flattering.",
        "Mel: And you're...",
        "Brian: Attractive, fun...",
        "Mel: Yes and yes. But between my work and my daughter, I really don't have time to see people.",
        "Brian: It's hard to make time, I know. Maybe you haven't had anything worth making time for.",
        "Mel: I just can't picture seeing myself with any man right now.",
        "Brian: Not the yes I was hoping for, but you haven't said no either, and I'm not going to force you to do that.",
        "Remy: Good, because that would be assault.",
        "Mel: What... Remy?",
        "Remy: I'm going to have to ask you to stay away from the good doctor, sir.",
        "Brian: Is this some kind of joke? I'm a lawyer.",
        "Remy: So is she. She's also a doctor that has a medical emergency that requires her attention.",
        "Mel: You know what? I am so sorry. I'll talk to you later.",
        "Remy: She is also my sister, and there are a lot of perfectly legal things I can do with this badge when I'm feeling creative. Are we clear?",
        "Mel: Was that necessary? (Sighs)",
        "Remy: Where is the wedding ring? Yeah, yeah, it was necessary. So anxious to make a mistake...",
        "Mel: I had it handled.",
        "Remy: So, you're seeing guys on the side?",
        "Mel: My husband doesn't have to answer to anything and I can't have coffee with somebody?",
        "Remy: It was wine!",
        "Mel: What does it matter?",
        "Remy: Look, I don't care if you divorce Rick, but staying in an unhappy marriage and having a guy on the side is not for you.",
        "Mel: How do you know what is for me? Okay, maybe I'm just sick of playing by those rules. Maybe I am tired of being the perfect wife and the perfect mother and the perfect Boudreau and the perfect Bauer!",
        "Remy: Where are you going?",
        "Mel: If you know me so well, then why do you have to ask?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Knock on the door)",
        "Jeffrey: Mel, it's nice to see you.",
        "Mel: It's better to see you.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, please, come in. I'm just, you know, gonna finish getting dressed.",
        "Mel: Oh, well, you don't have to.",
        "Jeffrey: What's going on?",
        "Mel: Nothing. Can I just come by and see an old friend?",
        "Jeffrey: Is that what this is?",
        "Mel: It could be a lot of things.",
        "Jeffrey: You know, Mel, out of all of the beautiful women in Springfield, do you know how you rank?",
        "Mel: I never thought...",
        "Jeffrey: You don't. You don't, because you're off the charts. You're exquisite.",
        "Mel: Thank you.",
        "Jeffrey: No, really. It's really hard to look at you sometimes because you're stunning. You can turn a man to stone.",
        "Mel: I don't mean to.",
        "Jeffrey: It's not your fault, really. Because it's like you're forbidden fruit. It's like you're a ripe, ripe peach. An unsqueezed lemon, yeah. A 450 fuel-injected dual carbed fastback, upholstered with fine Corinthian leather.",
        "Mel: Jeffrey, your a jackass.",
        "Jeffrey: What gave me away?",
        "Mel: Well, I liked the squeezey lemon part and the turning men into stone, but Corinthian leather?",
        "Jeffrey: Too much?",
        "Mel: I've never been compared to an automobile interior before.",
        "Jeffrey: (Laughs) Trouble at home?",
        "Mel: You can let go of me now.",
        "Jeffrey: Are you sure, I thought that I was going to get lucky there. So, you want something to drink?",
        "Mel: I already tried that once. My brother, the cop scared the guy away.",
        "Jeffrey: That's because your brother knows his sister. He knows you're not the type to cheat on her husband.",
        "Mel: I'm not so sure.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay.",
        "Mel: I don't know who I am anymore.",
        "Jeffrey: Join the club.",
        "Mel: But I'd like to find out. Can I try something? No, nothing. (Sighs)",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Good... for you. Are we done?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Man: Okay. Welcome to narcotics anonymous. Who would like to start?",
        "Rick: Hi, my name's Rick. And I'm an addict.",
        "Audience: Hi, Rick.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mel: You know, I am more than just the perfect mother and the perfect doctor and the perfect lawyer.",
        "Dinah: Perfect and lawyer, isn't that an oxymoron? Hi, Mel.",
        "Mel: Dinah.",
        "Dinah: Hi.",
        "Jeffrey: I was just telling Mel that I've got to get finished getting dressed.",
        "Dinah: Oh, me, too. And that part about the perfect lawyer, you know, I need one of those. I'm glad you stopped by.",
        "Mel: I suppose you weren't expecting to drop anything else why you were here? I was planning on it, but I came to my senses.",
        "Dinah: Good. Let's talk about you being my lawyer.",
        "Mel: No. No. I'm in no position to defend anyone else's unjustifiable behavior.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: It's been a really long time since I've been on the pills. And I'm grateful to let that go. But there's something I've not been able to let go, and that's my past. I'm.... I'm addicted to it. It has caused me judgment lapses that have led to unthinkable tragedy in my life. And I really know that I have to own up to it if I'm ever going to have a healthy, substantive life. I get nostalgic when I think about when I was young because the possibilities, you know, of who you were at the time and what you thought your life was going to turn out to for me was the best time. Because I met the dearest friends of my life during that period of time. I miss that connection. That sense of knowing, no matter what, that you always had at least one person who was in your corner no matter what.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mel: Dinah, I'm not going to ask you if you set that fire in the hotel.",
        "Dinah: I did. I did. I admit it. I burned a pile of Mallet's clothes, and the fire got out of control. And I was looking for a way to deal with how betrayed I felt, how hurt I felt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: So when I had somebody, you know, who needed my help, well, I'm Rick Bauer, it's my duty to help you. But that was the addict in me. Justifying my actions in spite of the fact that it was really ruining my life, ruining my marriage to my wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mel: So the person that you loved, the person that you trusted, the person that you bared your soul to, the one person that you..",
        "Dinah: Screwed me.",
        "Mel: And the pain was so devastating and the betrayal was so blinding that you did anything to make it go away.",
        "Dinah: Exactly. And I almost burned down an entire hotel.",
        "Mel: Well, that's not how you should deal with something like that.",
        "Dinah: I know that. I know that. But what do you do? What do you do with all of that pain? What do you do with all of that hurt?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Quite a hypocrite, my friend.",
        "Rick: I owe you an apology.",
        "Gus: Drug abuse is a disease.",
        "Rick: I judged you, Gus, and I was wrong. I'm sorry. Because I was worried about you being around my son, Gus, because I was worried about being around my son.",
        "Gus: Kids, we'll do anything, anything to protect them. Anyway, so you and Mel, is it really that bad?",
        "Rick: We're working on it.",
        "Gus: Well, good. She's in the house, or is she's...",
        "Rick: Well, I'm on the couch.",
        "Gus: At least you're both in the house. There's hope.",
        "Rick: There's hope, yeah. The hearing is the first step to that, maybe. Who knows, even if I get my job back, there's going to be people who can't forgive me and I understand.",
        "Gus: You know a while ago, I find out that Harley was cheating on me with Mallet.",
        "Rick: I'm sorry, Gus. I...",
        "Gus: That's the one thing I thought I could never forgive somebody for, you know. But compared to my love for her, at the end of the day, it just didn't really seem to matter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mel: You know what? I have to go. I have a decision I have to make.",
        "Jeffrey: Whoa, whoa, whoa. So you're going to come all the way over here and lay all of that on my doorstep and not stay for the famous O'Neill lecture?",
        "Mel: I hate those.",
        "Dinah: Come on, why don't we just get trashed and curse the men of the world.",
        "Jeffrey: Does that include me?",
        "Dinah: Honey, you're on the top of that list. Welcome to the bitter hearts club. I'd like to make a toast.",
        "Jeffrey: Hey, hey.",
        "Dinah: To life, love, and nothing that ties a woman down.",
        "Jeffrey: Dinah, I thought you liked to be tied down.",
        "Dinah: I'm talking no entanglements.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, well, here's to a life without commitment and without pressure from anyone else.",
        "Dinah: That's right, it's not about what other people want. It's about what you want.",
        "Jeffrey: Here, here.",
        "Dinah: Yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Grant: Dr. Bauer, let's get this under way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mel: My little brother.",
        "Dinah: Uh-oh, the cops.",
        "Remy: You've got two lawyers with you. What are you worrying about? And you missed dinner with mom.",
        "Mel: Dad is teaching a course at Oxford this summer. Mom is lonely, so...",
        "Remy: Not really. He called her three times during dinner.",
        "Dinah: Well, that's impressive. At least they still want each other.",
        "Remy: More than ever from what I heard. That's too much information. She's all yours next time.",
        "Mel: Yeah.",
        "Dinah: I guess there are exceptions. Mel, I want you to go off and I want you to tell me what you hate about relationships because it cannot be easy being a Boudreau and a Bauer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Grant: Are you expecting someone?",
        "Rick: I was expecting my wife to be here.",
        "Dr. Grant: It's only five 'til. We can give her a little time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mel: Well, I have to admit it isn't always easy being a Bauer. I mean, there's a lot of pressure and expectations. And with Rick being suspended from the hospital, I feel like the whole entire weight of the family is on me.",
        "Dinah: And then there's your family, which is, like, unbelievable. Talk about high achievers.",
        "Mel: Yeah, we're very hard workers. We're not the flashiest people around, but we're solid. You know, we have our traditions. You know, if I were to get divorced from Rick, it would be the first divorce in my entire family, ever.",
        "Jeffrey: You know, you've got to do what you've got to do, Mel. You can't stay in a marriage out of guilt.",
        "Mel: I'm saying that I'm staying in the marriage because I believe in the institution. Both of my parents taught me that now matter how hard I worked in my career, I would have to work twice as hard in my marriage.",
        "Dinah: Where did that get you?",
        "Mel: Divorce is easy. Marriage is what's hard.",
        "Dinah: Well, good that you're a hard worker.",
        "Mel: You know what? I don't think I want to be a part of this club anymore. Hi, Mom.",
        "Felicia: Hi, baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Charles, I'm sorry to keep you waiting like this.",
        "Dr. Grant: We have to do this, Rick.",
        "Rick: I respect that.",
        "Lillian: Sorry to interrupt?",
        "Rick: You're not interrupting anything. My wife is obviously not going to show up.",
        "Dr. Grant: Detective Harley Cooper is very passionate in her support. She's, uh...",
        "Rick: She's Jude's mother. We're obviously not together, Charles, but we're in good terms.",
        "Dr. Grant: In her letter she points out that no criminal charges have ever been filed against you. Beth Spaulding. She's dropped any call for an internal investigation. So this is a judgment call. It's up to me.",
        "Rick: Yes, sir.",
        "Dr. Grant: Therefore, it's my job, Dr. Bauer, to make sure you follow hospital policy and do nothing that might put Cedars in jeopardy. Hospitals get sued. It doesn't mean we like it.",
        "Rick: I understand that.",
        "Dr. Grant: Especially when one of our best doctors is named in the complaint.",
        "Rick: Yes, sir, I understand that.",
        "Dr. Grant: Do you?",
        "Rick: Of course I do.",
        "Dr. Grant: I'm going to be candid. Don't screw up again. Your family has a long tradition to this hospital. Did I mention a phone call I recently got from the former chief of staff?",
        "Rick: I know how my father feels about this.",
        "Dr. Grant: He's concerned. The fact that your wife has chosen not to speak in your behalf is troubling. If your own wife doesn't trust your judgment, how can I?",
        "Rick: Charles, I'm not going to speak against my wife. This is between you and I. It's obviously your call.",
        "Lillian: Are you coming back? All of the nurses are buzzing.",
        "Rick: I bet there is a pool, all of the nurses against me, right? I have my job back. I'll be working in the evenings, I'm sure it will be under a microscope, but I have my job back.",
        "Lillian: I'm so glad.",
        "Rick: So am I. Thanks for your support.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mel: Hey, you guys. Thanks for coming.",
        "Leah: Is Jude coming, too?",
        "Mel: Every family member that I could find. Michelle said she'd call, so...",
        "Leah: Good going, Mom.",
        "Remy: You ready to get whooped or what?",
        "Leah: You broke my controller last time, Uncle Remy.",
        "Remy: That's why I bought you a new one.",
        "Felicia: What was that all about?",
        "Mel: Video games.",
        "Felicia: Doesn't anyone read a good book anymore?",
        "Mel: Mom, you're channeling dad.",
        "Felicia: I guess I am. So, his hearing was today?",
        "Mel: Yes.",
        "Felicia: And?",
        "Mel: I didn't go.",
        "Felicia: Melissande!",
        "Mel: Mom, if I went, I would have had to tell the truth and say how I really feel and I'm just not ready to trust him right now.",
        "Felicia: Trusting him would be a very big step.",
        "Mel: That's why I made this dinner. You know, it's a little step, but it's a step I'm willing to take.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: I have to see you, right now.",
        "Beth: I'm glad you called.",
        "Rick: It's because I really needed to see you.",
        "Beth: You know, when Alan was taken to the ER, they couldn't find me because I was with you. And I guess I should feel guilty about that, but I don't. What a wonderful place to be, with you.",
        "Rick: This has to be the last time, Beth. I just can't do this anymore.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "R.J.: It's me and you. There's a picture of us and on the internet.",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Hawk: Josh Lewis, whatever made you think that this foolishness would work.",
        "Doris: The state's charging Lizzie with attempted murder.",
        "Jonathan: Let's just do it.",
        "Tammy: Do what?",
        "Jonathan: Get married today.",
        "Announcer: This September, Jonathan is forced to make a choice...",
        "Tammy: You can't let them take me away. Jonathan?",
        "Announcer: ...One he never thought he'd have to make.",
        "Jonathan: I have something I need to say. Something that's going to change everything.",
        "Alan: You're little game is going to be over."
