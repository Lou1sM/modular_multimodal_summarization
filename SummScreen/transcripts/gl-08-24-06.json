        "Beth: Rick? Have you been avoiding me?\r\nBecause I've left messages for you everywhere. ",
        "Rick: Ah, yeah... no, actually, I haven\u2019t.\r\nI've just been reinstated and my workload, it has been a hectic day catching up\r\nwith everything. ",
        "Beth: Okay, but I think we need to talk,\r\ndon't you? ",
        "Rick: Sure, but not here, Beth. ",
        "Beth: Why not, this is private enough? ",
        "Rick: Why not? Beth, this is Alan\u2019s room.\r\nRemember him? The husband you're cheating on with me, and this is his chart\r\nright here signed by my wife. This is getting just a little crazy for me. I'm\r\nsorry. ",
        "Beth: Alan is up getting tests, and he will\r\nbe gone for a while. And as far as moral judgments go, you and I both know that\r\nright and wrong are relative terms. ",
        "",
        "Lizzie: Thank you guys for bailing me out.\r\nMel, thanks for taking my case. ",
        "Tammy: Your mom called and she left a\r\nmessage. She didn't know you'd been arrested. ",
        "Lizzie: Why should I tell her? It's not like\r\nshe would try to help. ",
        "Doris: Mel, I thought I would do you the\r\ncourtesy of bringing Miss Spaulding\u2019s paperwork in person. ",
        "Mel: Well, that's so thoughtful of you, Doris.\r\n",
        "Doris: The state is charging Lizzie with\r\nattempted murder. ",
        "Jonathan: What? That's insane. When she\r\npulled the trigger, it was self-defense. ",
        "Tammy: And Alan didn't even get hurt. ",
        "Doris: Really? So why is he in the hospital\r\nright now? I'll consider a plea. ",
        "Jonathan: Oh, go to hell. ",
        "Mel: Jonathan. ",
        "Jonathan: No, this is such a vendetta. She's\r\nonly going after Lizzie because she thinks we hurt her precious daughter. ",
        "Mel: Jonathan, please. You are not helping.\r\nWould you just go, please, both of you? ",
        "Tammy: She's right, Jonathan. ",
        "Jonathan: You will not go down for this, Lizzie.\r\nI promise. ",
        "",
        "Josh: Oh, good, I'm glad you're here. ",
        "Cassie: Well, you asked me to meet you here,\r\nI'll meet you here. ",
        "Josh: The meeting went great. The PR firm,\r\nthey're going to do a bunch of work pro bono. Nice dress, by the way. ",
        "Cassie: R.J.'s play date canceled. ",
        "Josh: Oh. I see. Well, your friend's loss is\r\nour big gain. How you doing, big man? ",
        "R.J.: Okay. ",
        "Josh: Good to see you. ",
        "R.J.: Good to see you, too. ",
        "Josh: All right. ",
        "R.J.: I'm looking for the fall soccer\r\npractice schedule. I can't find the site. Cool, it's me and you. There's a\r\npicture of us on the internet. ",
        "Cassie: What? ",
        "",
        "Rick: Look, this thing that is going on\r\nbetween us-- it's really-- it has gotten out of hand. It can't go on because\r\nit's wrong. It's just wrong. Do you know I haven't even spoken to my wife since\r\nyesterday afternoon? I haven't even told her I've been reinstated? ",
        "Beth: Yeah, well, she would have heard if\r\nshe was at the reinstatement where she should have been. ",
        "Rick: That's not the only reason. The other\r\nreason is we stayed at the hotel room late. ",
        "Beth: We needed each other. ",
        "Rick: But that doesn't make it right. ",
        "Beth: We have a connection that goes way\r\nback that very few people can comprehend, and during tough times like this, it\r\nis natural we lean on each other because other people don't know what to give. \r\n",
        "Rick: This whole thing is starting to be a\r\ncrutch for both of us. ",
        "Beth: Name me one person who doesn't need a\r\ncrutch now and then. Come on, Rick. When I'm with you, I get to go back in\r\ntime. I get to be someone I haven't been in a long time. I get to be the Beth I\r\nused to be, and I like that person. Don't make me say good-bye to her. ",
        "Rick: You don't have to. Look, if Alan\r\ndoesn't accept you for who you are, then leave. ",
        "Beth: It's not that simple. ",
        "Rick: Yes, it's that simple. ",
        "Beth: No, it's not. ",
        "Rick: Beth, if you're not happy, then go.\r\nDon't use me as an excuse to stay in an unfulfilling marriage. Don't do it. \r\n",
        "Beth: Alan does make me happy. I know you\r\nmay not understand. But there are certain things that I get from Alan that I\r\ncan't get from you or from anyone else. I don't want to choose between you or\r\nbetween the two parts of myself. I want them both. And so do you. ",
        "",
        "R.J.: Mom, what does it mean? ",
        "Cassie: I think it's somebody's idea of a\r\njoke, honey. ",
        "R.J.: I don't get the joke. ",
        "Cassie: You know what, neither do I. Didn't\r\nyou want to watch the Sox game? We have some work to do here, but you can watch\r\nin the other room. ",
        "R.J.: Okay. ",
        "Cassie: I cannot believe this. Who would do\r\nsuch a thing to an innocent child? Who would be so cruel? ",
        "Josh: Someone who's going to be very sorry\r\nonce I get my hands on him. ",
        "Cassie: Thank goodness R.J. doesn't\r\nunderstand what it means. ",
        "Josh: Okay, we're going to have to tell him\r\nabout us. Talk to him about us. You realize that right? ",
        "Cassie: Already? ",
        "Josh: Well, would you rather he get his\r\ninformation from a blog? ",
        "Cassie: No. ",
        "Josh: He'll be fine, Cassie. He's a strong\r\nkid. And besides, he likes me. ",
        "Cassie: Well, lucky for you. ",
        "",
        "Hawk: Josh Lewis, whatever made you think\r\nthis foolishness would work? ",
        "(Cell phone rings)",
        "Billy: Reva's mobile. ",
        "Hawk: Do you know what your brother has\r\ndone, Billy Lewis? He has taken up with Cassie! With Reva\u2019s own sister. ",
        "Billy: Yeah, I know about it. So does Reva. ",
        "Hawk: Well, what is she doing still up\r\nthere? Why isn't she back here in Springfield giving those two a piece of her\r\nmind? Much less a good whoopin'? ",
        "Billy: I know you love Reva and you're\r\ntrying to protect her, but this situation is more complicated than you think. \r\n",
        "Hawk: Complicated my hind foot! What it is,\r\nis plain wrong! ",
        "Billy: Hawk, you need to take a breath and\r\nback off. ",
        "Hawk: No! What I need to do is put an end to\r\nit-- now! ",
        "",
        "Tammy: Poor Lizzie, did you see how worried\r\nshe is. ",
        "Jonathan: That kind of stress can't be good\r\nfor the baby. ",
        "Tammy: Mel is a great lawyer. If anybody can\r\nget her off... ",
        "Jonathan: What if she can't? Lizzie has my\r\nkid in jail? Oh, that's disgusting. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. ",
        "Tammy: For what? None of this is your fault.\r\n",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, but when this baby came into\r\nmy life, I promised you it wouldn't come between us. And now here we are\r\nengaged a few days, and we can't even enjoy it. ",
        "Tammy: Maybe we were naive to think we could\r\npull it off. Maybe we bit off more than we could chew. ",
        "Jonathan: No, no, I'm not going to accept\r\nthat. I just wish there was some way to prove to you that you come... you come\r\nfirst. ",
        "Tammy: What? ",
        "Jonathan: Why wait? Let's just do it. ",
        "Tammy: Do what? ",
        "Jonathan: Get married. Let's do it today. ",
        "",
        "Rick: You can't do this. Okay, you can't\r\nhave a marriage with Alan and this life with me. It's just completely\r\nirrational. ",
        "Beth: I love the way you're suddenly putting\r\nthis all on me. Like I'm pushing you to do something you don't want to do. Who\r\ncalled whom last night, Rick? You called me. I didn't call you. So let's not\r\nmake me out to be the bad guy. ",
        "Rick: I'm not doing that. I called you\r\nbecause I wanted to see you. ",
        "Beth: You needed me, and you still do. You\r\ncan lie to yourself all you want, but you are a long way off from getting\r\nthings back on track with Mel. You know what the difference is between you and\r\nme? You're ashamed of looking out for yourself, of putting your needs first.\r\nI'm not anymore. You should think about that. ",
        "Rick: Well, the potato salad was a\r\nhuge hit tonight. You know something, I always am amazed that there are people that\r\ndon't like the barbecue. There are people who have their issues and they fight\r\nand everything, but I'm always left with this renewed sense of hope. Like Danny\r\nand Michelle\u2019s wedding for instance. ",
        "Mel: That was a long time ago. ",
        "Rick: It wasn't that long ago. And\r\nthey fought for their marriage, and I'm just really proud of both of them for\r\nhanging in there. ",
        "Mel: Hint, hint? I'm sorry, okay.\r\nI'm sorry, but why do you always have to push? ",
        "Rick: I was just feeling happy and\r\nI just wanted to share it with you. That's all. ",
        "Mel: Oh, you wanted to share with\r\nme? Now you want to share with me. Rick, you know what? I want to be happy, I\r\ndo. I really wish that things were the way they were. ",
        "Rick: Do you really? Do you\r\nreally? ",
        "Mel: Yes, I do, but I'm just-- I'm\r\nnot there. ",
        "Rick: Any idea, any clue when that\r\nmight be? Somewhere towards the end of our lives? Five years from now? Ten\r\nyears from now? Can you give me some idea when that's going to be? ",
        "Mel: You did something horrible.\r\nOkay, now I have a problem because I can't excuse it? Because I don't want to\r\njust hop back in the sack with you and pretend everything is okay. You know\r\nwhat, if that bothers you so much, why don't you go and take a cold shower, or\r\nhave an affair? Just stop blaming me for your mistakes. ",
        "",
        "Beth: Well, your plan to pay off Jonathan\r\nRandall really worked well. ",
        "Alan: At least I was trying to\r\nprotect Elizabeth. ",
        "Beth: Instead you pushed Lizzie\r\nfurther away from us and closer to Jonathan. Did it ever occur to you to\r\nconsult me? ",
        "Alan: There wasn't enough time, Beth.\r\nAnd besides, consulting is not a part of my nature. You knew that when you\r\nmarried me. I'm going to ask you something: Isn't it the role of a wife to\r\nsupport her husband? ",
        "Beth: The role? You still don't\r\nget it, Alan. ",
        "Alan: Wait, wait. Where are you\r\ngoing? ",
        "Beth: Good night, Alan. ",
        "",
        "Cassie: Couldn't I just talk to R.J. about\r\nsomething simple, like sex or drugs or middle eastern politics? ",
        "Josh: Look, its going to be fine. I'll go in\r\nand have a chat with him, mano a mano. ",
        "Cassie: Mano a mano? ",
        "Josh: Yes, something like that. He'll\r\nappreciate that. I'll talk to him like he is a grownup. ",
        "Cassie: But he's not a grownup. ",
        "Josh: I know that, Cassie. If I need backup,\r\nI'll call you. ",
        "Cassie: No. No. I think this is something we\r\nshould do together. So I'll go get him. (Knock on the door) ",
        "Josh: Yeah. Oh, you're still in town. I'm so\r\nhappy. ",
        "Hawk: Oh, I have got a bone to pick with the\r\ntwo of you! ",
        "Josh: Look, look, look, I already told you I\r\ndon't want to hear it. ",

        "R.J.: Hawk! I didn't know you were coming. ",
        "Hawk: Yes, I'm here, little partner, and I'm\r\ngoing to be here as long as you need me. Lord, I'm reckoning you might be\r\nreally confused about that. ",
        "Josh: Okay, okay. ",
        "R.J.: Confused about what? ",
        "Josh: Grandpa, you've got to go. ",
        "Hawk: About your Uncle Josh taking up with\r\nyour mom when he's still married to your Aunt Reva. I mean... ",

        "Jonathan: Ugh! We're on. I found a Justice\r\nof the Peace who will come over here right now and marry us. ",
        "Tammy: Wow. ",
        "Jonathan: This is good. This is what we\r\nneed, right? We're going to be a unified front and show everybody that nothing\r\ncan get in our way. ",

        "Jonathan: What? ",
        "Tammy: We've only been engaged for a couple\r\nof days. I don't have a dress or flowers or any of that stuff. ",
        "Jonathan: No. Look, you do have flowers, and\r\nI want you to wear what you have on, or nothing. You can wear nothing. Or wear\r\njust what you have on, come on. ",
        "Tammy: Yeah. ",
        "Jonathan: Listen to me. We do this right\r\nnow, we're making a statement. We're saying: Don't mess with us. Whatever\r\nhappens with Lizzie and the baby, whatever happens with your mom and Josh,\r\nwhatever happens with Reva, whatever happens, we're saying we're going to deal\r\nwith it, together. Down the road we'll have another ceremony. We'll have a\r\nparty with our friends and family. But this, today, this is for us. This is me\r\nstarting right now the rest of my life dedicated to driving you crazy. (Laughing\r\n) I mean unless you don't want that. If you don\u2019t... ",

        "Beth: Avoiding Alan. It's either\r\nthat or kill him. ",
        "Rick: That sounds like a plan.\r\nYeah, so my wife just can't find it in her heart, after all of this time, to\r\nforgive me, Beth. I guess it is just bad enough I did something severe to help\r\na friend, but that friend-- ",
        "Beth: Was Phillip? ",
        "Rick: Beth, she basically is\r\naccusing me of loving him more than my own family and more than her. ",

        "Beth: Yeah. Well, right now I'm\r\njust glad that you're here. (Laughter) I was furious when I found out you\r\nknew Phillip was alive and you didn't tell me. I was furious. ",
        "Rick: I know you were furious. ",
        "Beth: But then I think how I was\r\nwilling to help Phillip take the kids away the night he was shot. And when you\r\nfound out about that, you were pretty furious about that, but you forgave me.\r\nSo I don't have any right to stay mad at you. We've both done things we're\r\nashamed of. ",
        "Rick: (Laughs) She did. Oh, man,\r\nthis felt good. This has been great. This has been really great. ",

You set that boy up to be humiliated, not me. What's\r\nhappened to you, Josh? You used to be a decent man. How did you come to the\r\npoint where you can rationalize adultery and deception? ",
