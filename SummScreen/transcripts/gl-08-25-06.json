        "Buzz: Ashlee, it's me. I thought you're supposed to be working today. Where \r\nare you? Call me, please. I thought we were supposed to be moving on. ",
        "Olivia: I just wanted to see if it was still there. It is. ",
        "Buzz: Or somebody else's deep, dark secret. Don't look at it anymore. ",
        "Olivia: Whoever's behind this is a jerk. ",
        "Buzz: They'll get theirs. ",
        "Olivia: They better hope I'm not the one to give it to them. ",
        "",
        "Ava: You have a 4:00 pm with Louise Sorenson. I have other paperwork here for \r\nyou. And the mayor's report, you said you wanted to take a look at it tonight?\r\n",
        "Alan-Michael: I did. Thank you. ",
        "Ava: Is there anything else I can help you with? ",
        "Alan-Michael: How about an iced coffee? On me.",
        "Ava: Thanks, but I have plans with Coop, though. ",
        "Coop: Hey, you off the clock yet? ",
        "Ava: I think so. Alan-Michael? ",
        "Coop: I think I'll take that as a yes. By the way, thanks for taking care of \r\nmy girl. ",
        "",
        "Dinah: Back off, O\u2019Neill. I told you I'm going to get Alan-Michael on your \r\nside, but it's not going to be overnight. Why? Because Alan-Michael and Blakey \r\nare old friends. Okay, you know what? I have work to do, and I don't need to \r\nhear anymore of your threats. ",
        "Delivery man: Dinah Marler? ",
        "Dinah: Yeah? ",
        "Delivery man: Sorry it's late. I hope it's in time for the wedding. ( \r\nLaughing )",

        "Gus: Hey. I thought you had the day off. ",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I do. ",
        "Gus: Reading up on Jeffrey O\u2019Neill, huh? ",
        "Mallet: Yeah, there's something going on between him and Dinah. I'm going to \r\nfigure out what it is. ",
        "Marina: Funny you should mention that. ",
        "Mallet: You've got something? ",
        "Remy: \"Springfield Burns\" again. ",
        "Marina: I'm so sorry, Mallet. ",
        "",
        "Lizzie: I can't believe you were almost married. I mean I saw you earlier. \r\nHow did this happen so fast? ",
        "Tammy: Easy, okay. When Jonathan is afraid he is going to lose something, he \r\nholds on to it as tight as he can, any way he can. ",
        "Lizzie: I don't get it. He thought he was losing you? Why? ",
        "Tammy: Because of you, Lizzie. ",
        "",
        "Ashlee: Mom, I'm going away. Don't be mad. I'm just going away for a couple \r\nof days. ",
        "Doris: What do you mean you're going away? ",
        "Ashlee: Like on a trip. I don't know quite where yet, but it should be lots \r\nof fun. ",
        "Doris: Wait, wait, wait. Ashlee, start over. Who are you going with, a \r\nfriend? ",
        "Ashlee: Sort of. It's Jonathan Randall. ",
        "Doris: Jonathan Randall?! ",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughing ) Perfect. ",
        "Doris: Is he there? Put him on the phone. ",
        "Ashlee: Sure, he wants to talk to you, too. ",
        "Jonathan: Hey, Doris, don't worry. You're baby and I are going to have a \r\nblast. And I'll have her home sometime next week, probably. ",
        "Doris: Listen you little punk, if you think you're going to get away with \r\nthis... ",
        "Jonathan: Oops, got to go. We'll call you as soon as we get back. Bye-bye.\r\n",
        "Doris: Randall. Randall! ",

        "Olivia: I'm sorry, and I don't mean to dwell on it. ",
        "Buzz: Oh, come on, someone dredged up part of your past you thought was dead \r\nand buried. Come on. ",
        "Olivia: Well, it was never dead to me. ",
        "Buzz: Well, you didn't leave it out there for the world to see. You did such \r\na bang up job of stuffing it away and making less than something real, and now \r\nit hits you smack between the eyes. It stinks no matter what way you look at it. \r\nThe trick is to let it roll off your back. ",
        "Olivia: See, I don't know how to do that. ",
        "Buzz: You think about the good stuff, you know. Emma, me, even. You know, \r\nwhat's important. ",
        "Olivia: You make it sound simple. I just hope they don\u2019t... ",
        "Buzz: They don't what? ",
        "Olivia: Post something else. Let's face it, I have more skeletons in my \r\ncloset than shoes, and I have a lot of shoes. ",
        "Buzz: We all have skeletons, not shoes, but skeletons. ",
        "Olivia: Why is this person being so malicious? ",
        "Buzz: They're miserable, they hate themselves. They just want everybody else \r\nto suffer as much as they're suffering. ",
        "Olivia: All right, I sort of identify with that. But when I go after \r\nsomebody, it's because I feel like they're wrong. What did I do to deserve this? \r\nWhy don't they have the you- know-what to face me in person? And why are they \r\nhiding behind a web site? ",
        "Buzz: All good questions. I don't have the answers. But I tell you what, I \r\ndon't care, and neither should you. Young lady, you need a distraction. ",
        "Olivia: I have to go home, Jane has been there all day. ",
        "Buzz: No. She can stay there a couple more hours. ",
        "Olivia: I couldn't do that. ",
        "Buzz: You could, you could, you know you could. Come on, we'll be back before \r\nbedtime. ",
        "Olivia: What the heck. ",
        "",
        "Remy: Okay, so here's the postings. ",
        "Mallet: Thanks for setting us up. ",
        "Remy: My pleasure. ",
        "Marina: As you can see, our blogger doesn't discriminate, Blake Marler, my \r\ndad, Olivia, who knows who will be next. ",
        "Mallet: What do the names of the photos mean? ",
        "Remy: They're people that person's pissed off at one time or another. ",
        "Marina: Potential enemies, possible suspects. ",
        "Mallet: Well that's great, Dinah\u2019s list is the longest. ",
        "Marina: That doesn't necessarily mean anything. I mean, whoever's doing this \r\nhas it out for half the town, not just Dinah. ",
        "Beth: We have to find the common link. Dinah is a victim just like everybody \r\nelse. ",
        "Gus: Good job, you guys. Keep it up. ",
        "Mallet: Oh, man. Half the town may be victims, but half the town is after my \r\ngirl. ",
        "Gus: Don't worry, the guy can't hide forever. ",
        "Mallet: Do you still have your contact at the bureau? ",
        "Gus: You want to get some dirt on Jeffrey O\u2019Neill. Let me ask you something: \r\nWhat if you're the blogger? ",
        "Mallet: Dinah's has something on him. Why else would he jeopardize his own \r\nelection to get her out of jail? ",
        "Gus: I don't know, maybe they're sleeping together. ",
        "",
        "Dinah: Cute enough to marry? ",
        "Mallet: Bathrobe and all. ",
        "Dinah: I think it is much cuter than a one-of-a-kind gown. ",
        "Mallet: Nah. The truth is, if I get to put that ring on your finger, that's \r\nall that matters. ",

        "Alan-Michael: I was trying to convince your girlfriend to have coffee with \r\nme. ",
        "Coop: Business or pleasure, Alan-Michael? ",
        "Alan-Michael: A little of both. She has been amazing this week. ",
        "Coop: She's always amazing. ",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm sure. ",
        "Ava: Do you need me to stay? ",
        "Alan-Michael: That's not necessary. I have the mayor\u2019s report. ",
        "Ava: Okay, because I will if you need me to. ",
        "Alan-Michael: No, you go do whatever. ",
        "Coop: How about the movies? ",
        "Ava: My idea: Chick flick. Yeah! ",
        "Alan-Michael: You're a better man than I. ",
        "Ava: No kidding. ",
        "Coop: We can have popcorn, gummy worms. ",
        "Ava: Gummy worms, yeah. ( Cell phone rings ) ",

        "Dinah: I need to see you, right now. ",
        "Alan-Michael: It's going to have to wait until tomorrow. I have work to do \r\ntonight. ",
        "Dinah: It can't wait. Are you coming back to your room? ",
        "Alan-Michael: Yes, but-- ",

        "Ashlee: You should have heard what she said when I told her that we were \r\ngoing away together. ",
        "Jonathan: I did. ",
        "Ashlee: Ballistic. I wish I could have seen her face. Usually when she gets \r\nmad, she gets purple, her eyes bug out. ",
        "Jonathan: More than usual. ",
        "Ashlee: What did she say to you? Did she start swearing? She can curse like a \r\ntruck driver. Do you she hates you? She thinks you're the devil. ",
        "Jonathan: Sometimes I am the devil. ",
        "Ashlee: Usually I'm so nervous around her. It seems different when I'm with \r\nyou. ",
        "Jonathan: You did great. You're a natural hell-raiser. ",
        "Ashlee: You really think so? ",
        "Jonathan: Hell, yeah. ",
        "Ashlee: I'm just glad I could help. I just hope Buzz doesn't fire me for \r\nwalking out like that. ",
        "Jonathan: Nah, Buzz is cool. He'll understand it is for a good cause. ",
        "Ashlee: Anything for Lizzie. Anything for you. ",
        "Jonathan: Ashlee, you... ",
        "Ashlee: Oh, come on. I'm not dumb. I know you're not madly in love with me. \r\nAlthough, I wouldn't kick you out of my bed if you were. ( Laughter ) You're \r\ndoing this for your baby, and that's really cool. ",
        "Jonathan: You're really cool, too. You know, you took a big risk messing with \r\nyour mom like that. ",
        "Ashlee: Well, she's fun to mess with. It's no big deal. ",
        "Jonathan: But she is your mom, though, and she definitely is the D.A. ",
        "Ashlee: Yeah, I mean, don't get me wrong. I love her more than anyone. She \r\nhas been there for me my whole life. But this is harmless, you know. I just want \r\nher to see you the way I see you, the real Jonathan. The guy that would give up \r\nanything for the people that he cares about. ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, it was a lot easier before when I didn't care about anything. \r\nThere was a lot less to lose. You ready for plan two? Part two of plan one? ",
        "Ashlee:( Laughing ) Yes. Bring it on. ",
        "Jonathan: Vamoose! ",
        "",
        "Tammy: Don't take this the wrong way, but Jonathan tried to pretend that you \r\nand the baby didn't even exist for months. He did that because of how hard we \r\nfought to be together. He didn't want anything, not anyone, not anyone, not even \r\nhis own child, to get in the way of that. The truth is, it did. You have. ",
        "Lizzie: I didn't mean to. ",
        "Tammy: I know you didn\u2019t. But or lives definitely are a lot more complicated \r\nnow. Not that we've ever known it to be much different, but... our love and or \r\nbond, that's not complicated. We don't need to be married to prove that. ( Cell \r\nphone rings ) Hello. ",
        "Doris: Tammy Winslow? ",
        "Tammy: Yeah. ",
        "Doris: Doris Wolfe. Get down to the police station right now. Your psycho \r\nboyfriend's kidnapped my daughter. ",

        "Dinah: Are you hungry? I thought maybe we could order something. I'm \r\nstarving. Maybe get a snack, a bottle of wine? ",
        "Alan-Michael: You came here to order dinner. ",
        "Dinah: No. I just saw the menu here and I thought maybe we could get \r\nsomething to eat, but obviously, you don't want to eat. ",
        "Alan-Michael: No, I could eat. ",
        "Dinah: Good then. We can get something. My stomach keeps making strange \r\nnoises. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Help me out here, first. Dedicated employee or stalker? ",
        "Dinah: Why don't we take it inside. ",
        "Alan-Michael: You're not packing this time, are you? ",
        "Dinah: Nope. Just my killer smile. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Okay, so? ",
        "Dinah: So I think Spaulding needs to stay behind Jeffrey in the election. ",
        "Alan-Michael: That's it? ",
        "Dinah: Yeah. I think we should probably endorse his candidacy. ",
        "Alan-Michael: We? ",
        "Dinah: Spaulding. ",

        "Dinah: Does it matter? ",
        "Alan-Michael: No. So you want O\u2019Neill to be the next mayor, huh? ",

        "Mallet: No, no, it hasn\u2019t. Funny you said that. ",
        "Gus: Yeah, because they have a history, those two. Sometimes it takes just \r\nthe tiniest spark to get things going. ",
        "Mallet: Dinah is not sleeping with him, I'm pretty sure about that. What's \r\ngoing between them is more complicated than sex. ",
