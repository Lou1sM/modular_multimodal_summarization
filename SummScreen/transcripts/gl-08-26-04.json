        "Harley: Daddy? Daddy, can you hear me? Can you open your eyes, daddy? Oh, my gosh. Don't worry about anything. I'm right here. I'm right here. Somebody call 911!",
        "Gus: I'm calling, I'm calling. Hi, this is detective aitoro. Listen, I'm at company. We need an ambulance right away, please. There's somebody... somebody is down. We have a man down. Maybe it's a heart attack. Maybe he's unconscious.",
        "Michelle: Harley? What happened?",
        "Harley: Michelle, he collapsed. He was clutching his chest. I think he's having a heart attack.",
        "Michelle: Do you have a defibrillator?",
        "Harley: No, no. Where's the ambulance?",
        "Michelle: Can you hear me? Can you hear me?",
        "Gus: They're here.",
        "Emt: Michelle, what have we got?",
        "Michelle: Probably cardiac incident. It's buzz cooper. He's been out for how long?",
        "Harley: Less than five minutes.",
        "Emt: Mr. Cooper, can you hear me? We're going to move you.",
        "Harley: This is too much. This is too much. First alex, and now phillip trying to bulldoze this place. Is he trying to kill him?",
        "Emt: One, two, three. Let's get him packaged. Come on. Mr. Cooper, we're going to get you over to the hospital as soon as possible. One, two, three.",
        "Harley: Call frank. Tell him I'm at cedars.",
        "Phillip: Reva, sandy, I'm so glad you could make it.",
        "Reva: Well, we wouldn't miss it.",
        "Sandy: Here we go.",
        "Phillip: Listen. I've been thinking about the adoption story that you pitched me.",
        "Sandy: Oh, yeah. We decided...",
        "Reva: No. Actually, we decided that you would be a real idiot to nix it, because you have so many people out in your television audience who are behind this thing who want to find biological parents, who...",
        "Phillip: I agree with you. I agree with you. I want you to do the story.",
        "Sandy: Wow. You are good.",
        "Reva: No, no. Don't wow. Don't wow this, because I'm waiting for the \"let's make a deal\" part. What is it you want, phillip?",
        "Rick: What have we got? Vitals?",
        "Emt: Bp is 170/90. Last pulse was 78, alhtough he's got a monitor on... sinus pause on monitor. Two rebreather and a 16 line.",
        "Rick: I need an ekg machine. Call x-ray, tell them I need portable chest, ap, and lateral right away.",
        "Mel: Harley, what can I do to help?",
        "Harley: Go to company and tell anna and randy they need to lock up. And my boys...",
        "Mel: No, no. It's no problem. Remy has them. They can just spend the night, okay?",
        "Harley: Thank you.",
        "Mel: I'm going to go over to company.",
        "Harley: Okay.",
        "Gus: Hey. Frank and marina are on their way, okay?",
        "Rick: Harley, were there any symptoms at all? Was he complaining of any chest pain, anything at all?",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Rick: Anything that you can tell me about the events leading up to this would help me.",
        "Harley: Oh, well, that's easy. It was phillip. Your good friend phillip is the reason that my father is fighting for his life.",
        "Dinah: What do you think?",
        "Edmund: You dyed your hair.",
        "Dinah: Yes, I needed a change. Do you like it?",
        "Edmund: Well, I think you needed a disguise, not a change.",
        "Dinah: Yeah. You're a very smart man. Yes. I think after jeffrey threatened me I thought maybe changing my look would be a good place to start. Oh. What's this? Very nice. You're too good to me.",
        "Edmund: If you'll excuse me, I have to make some calls.",
        "Cassie: Hello?",
        "Dinah: Mrs. Winslow, this is lois from jeffrey o'neill's office.",
        "Cassie: Oh. Hello.",
        "Dinah: I think mr. O'neill would like to meet you at the springfield inn, room 16, as soon as possible.",
        "Cassie: Springfield inn?",
        "Dinah: Something about an identity theft case, yes. I'll tell mr. O'neill you'll be there.",
        "Cassie: Why is everything a mystery with this man? God, I can't wait for this to be over.",
        "Dinah: Oh, try this italian fontina. It's delicious.",
        "Edmund: No, thank you.",
        "Dinah: Okay. Well, why don't we talk about you and cassie? How are things going as of late?",
        "Edmund: Very well, thank you very much for asking. And now that your good friend jeffrey o'neill has nabbed the lunatic that's been terrorizing her, we can all get back to our lives-- cassie and I hear in springfield, and jeffrey o'neill hopefully far, far away.",
        "Dinah: God, you wish. Things between you and jeffrey are not over yet. Look, I hate to upset you, but jeffrey and cassie are at the springfield inn as we speak.",
        "Edmund: That's ridiculous. Why would cassie need to meet with him now? Our business with him is finished.",
        "Dinah: I don't want to upset you, but edmund, somebody needs to tell you.",
        "Edmund: Tell me what?",
        "Dinah: That jeffrey and cassie aren't finished. They're just beginning, if you know what I mean. This portion of \"guiding light\" is sponsored by pampers. Inspired by babies, created by pampers.",
        "Cassie: Uh, jeffrey? What's going on? Come on. I am tired and in no mood for games, so show up and tell me what's going on. Oh, great. I am tired of this james bond stuff, tired of this freak who thought it was fun to pretend to be me. I'm just plain tired, and I want to be home! Oh, come on, jeffrey. Hurry up and let's get this over with.",
        "Edmund: What is this about? What are you trying to do?",
        "Dinah: I am trying to help you. I know how jeffrey operates.",
        "Edmund: I think I'm beginning to figure out how you operate. Every time cassie and I are about to put things back on track, you pop up and pour a whole lot of garbage in my ear and try to poison what we have together. And I have no idea why I've listened to any of it. Do you get some sort of sexual gratification out of all of this playing games with people's lives?",
        "Dinah: You have every reason to be suspicious. But if you'd like to see if I'm telling the truth, check the springfield inn, room 16. (Whistles) my goodness, edmund. Cassie has you tied up in all knots. You'll be much better off without her.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, it's o'neill.",
        "Dinah: Hi. It's me.",
        "Jeffrey: Please tell me this is a long-distance call.",
        "Dinah: No. Don't worry. I'm leaving town as soon as possible. I'm just tying up a few loose ends. Why don't you meet me at that bar on harper? One last drink.",
        "Jeffrey: I don't think so.",
        "Dinah: Oh, I think you will be very, very sorry if you don't, because I have a little surprise for you. And if you don't show up, i think you'll regret it.",
        "Reva: So what do you need from me?",
        "Phillip: Your endorsement.",
        "Reva: You're running for office?",
        "Phillip: Oh, no. Nothing that mundane. No, I'm trying to put spaulding back on its feet, and I realize that in the process I may step on a few toes.",
        "Reva: Or bulldoze them.",
        "Phillip: Oh, look. You know, buzz cooper used to be a man with big dreams. Once I've unchained him from that grill, he'll be free to pursue them again. He'll thank me.",
        "Reva: I doubt that. What do you want, phillip?",
        "Phillip: I just want to do an interview on your show, show your audience that spaulding isn't made up of heartless monsters, and that if everybody plays nice, there's a lot to be gained.",
        "Reva: Well, there's only one problem with that, because i don't think I can play nice.",
        "Phillip: You will if you want to stay on the air.",
        "Reva: So that's how you want to play this, huh? Okay. You're the boss.",
        "Phillip: I was hoping you would feel that way. I've got your camera crew set up in the living room. We'll do the interview in there.",
        "Reva: I am trying so hard to be a good employee, but I could possibly snap and make a complete fool out of him on the air. You don't want to miss this.",
        "Sandy: I'm right behind you.",
        "Harley: Phillip is out to get us. You should have seen him, nudging and goading my father. And now my father is in the...",
        "Rick: Your father is hanging in there, harley.",
        "Gus: What does that mean, rick?",
        "Rick: Harley, you know me. Dr. Pierce is the best cardiac surgeon around. He's going to do a good job. He's going to do everything he can. He's working on stabilizing your father. Once we do that, we're going to determine whether or not bypass surgery is an option, okay? In the meantime, your brother's on his way over here. By the time he gets here, I'll have more information for you, okay? It's going to be okay, all right?",
        "Harley: Stay away from me. It's because of you, you and your family, that my father is in there fighting for his life.",
        "Sandy: Come on, phillip. Where do you keep it? Oh, hey.",
        "Reva: What, are you self- destructive or a complete idiot?",
        "Tony: Hey.",
        "Michelle: Hey, did you just come from cedars?",
        "Mel: Yeah.",
        "Tony: How's buzz doing?",
        "Mel: It's too soon to tell, but I'm taking care of things for harley, and she wants the staff to close up and go home.",
        "Tony: All right. Well, yeah. I'll head back and tell them.",
        "Mel: Okay.",
        "Michelle: Well, we just had a little fun. We decided to help buzz out and take over for a little while-- practice for when we open light. You've got to come over and see the place, mel. You're not going to believe what we've done to it.",
        "Mel: So it's still \"we,\" huh?",
        "Michelle: How long have you and my brother been married? Because you sound exactly like him.",
        "Mel: He's just worried about you, michelle. We both are. It's not like we're against the lighthouse project. It could work.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, it will. It will work.",
        "Mel: All I'm saying is that if you get some legitimate backers, it might be better. You can do it.",
        "Michelle: Really? I'm just going to put my hand out, walk around the street, you know, expecting people to put money in there?",
        "Mel: It might happen, if you weren't tied up with tony santos. Michelle, you can do it without him.",
        "Dinah: Hello, darling.",
        "Jeffrey: What's with the hair?",
        "Dinah: Well, it's part of my big life change. I've decided to step down from the throne and return to life as little old me. This is how I looked when you rescued me from that dark cage. Do you remember?",
        "Jeffrey: Is that for me?",
        "Dinah: Mm-hmm. It's your favorite.",
        "Jeffrey: What's in it, cyanide?",
        "Dinah: Don't be so dramatic. Just drink it. You've already scared me enough, jeffrey. You really did. I'm leaving town.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that's music to my ears.",
        "Dinah: But I do have one little thing I'd like to do. I want to do something nice for you before I leave. It's sort of a parting gift.",
        "Jeffrey: Tell you what, sweetie, why don't you send me a postcard instead? That'll be fine for me.",
        "Dinah: Oh, no. I can do a little bit better than that, darling. I am going to tell you how to make cassie fall in love with you.",
        "Cassie: Who are you? Why are you doing this to me? Jeffrey! Help me! Jeffrey! I need you! I need help! Jeffrey... jeffrey, help. I need you. Jeffrey...",
        "Gus: Babe, I don't want anything to happen to your dad.",
        "Harley: I don't know what you want. I just know that when things are happening, you stand by.",
        "Gus: Look, I know you blame me for the whole alex thing, okay? But you really can't blame me for phillip's actions.",
        "Harley: I know. I know, because you're an innocent bystander. You just stand by, which I think is worse. Well, we don't need any innocent bystanders here. I don't need you here. So you can go.",
        "Frank: Sis, how is he?",
        "Harley: He's hanging in so far.",
        "Marina: So far?",
        "Harley: Well, rick... rick'll be out in a minute, okay? He can talk to us in a minute.",
        "Marina: Why is this happening? First you, dad, and now grandpa. What are you doing here?",
        "Gus: I was just making sure your aunt is okay. I was just... I'm going to leave in a minute.",
        "Marina: Yeah, good idea.",
        "Frank: Rick, tell me what's going on.",
        "Rick: Your father's conscious, but it appears that he had a heart attack. I sent his blood work upstairs to check his cardiac enzymes, and we'll run that test again in a couple of hours. In the meantime, I sent him up to the cath lab so we can get a closer look. Now, this camera tells exactly how much damage has been done to his heart.",
        "Harley: How bad is it?",
        "Rick: Any invasive test runs a certain amount of risk. I mean, we do have our cardiac team standing by just in case.",
        "Frank: In case of what?",
        "Rick: There is a chance he could have another heart attack. But we're going to make sure that that doesn't happen. Buzz would like to see gus and harley.",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Rick: Your father wants to see the two of you.",
        "Frank: Go. Go ahead. Just let him know that I'm here.",
        "Harley: Okay. Daddy?",
        "Buzz: Hey, kiddo.",
        "Harley: Hi. What are you doing, scaring me like that?",
        "Buzz: I don't know. Frank?",
        "Harley: He's outside. Do you want me to get him?",
        "Buzz: No. I need to talk to you and gus. Where is he?",
        "Harley: I don't think now is the time for small talk, dad.",
        "Buzz: Come here, gus. I'm not going to bite. Come here. You two, enough mistakes. Frank, alex, the restaurant...",
        "Harley: Daddy, don't do this now.",
        "Gus: Listen, we can come back...",
        "Harley: We can.",
        "Gus: ...Mr. Cooper...",
        "Buzz: I need you to shut up.",
        "Gus: Yes.",
        "Buzz: I want to fix what i can fix. Honey, we shouldn't have shown you that tape. It ruined your wedding day.",
        "Harley: It did not.",
        "Buzz: This I can fix. Can you promise your old man-- you, too-- on what may possibly be his...",
        "Harley: Daddy...",
        "Buzz: Promise me. Promise me. Give each other another shot. One more shot. You love each other. Promise me. Don't throw it away. Coming up on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Dinah: I think you need something complicated, a little more challenging.",
        "Edmund: Just remember when you're in the throes of passion to call out the right name. Because it's jeffrey you're looking for, not richard. Oprah: New mom gwyneth paltrow",
        "Harley: Daddy, you need to get through this first. Don't worry about us.",
        "Buzz: Humor me. How many times have I tried to give you fatherly advice? Honey, love is it. I know. I've had it. I've lost it. I've thrown it away. I would do anything to get it back, but I can'T. But you two have a chance. Harley, how many chances have you given me? Give this guy a chance to make good. I think he can do it. Harley?",
        "Harley: Okay, simmer down. Maybe you're right about love.",
        "Buzz: Ooh! I'm right. Mark that on the calendar.",
        "Harley: I'm not saying anything for sure, but, you know, we'll work on it. We'll see what happens.",
        "Buzz: Okay.",
        "Harley: Okay?",
        "Gus: I'll do whatever I can, mr. Cooper.",
        "Buzz: That's all I ask. There. I feel better.",
        "Harley: Good.",
        "Buzz: Now go get frank.",
        "Harley: Okay.",
        "Buzz: Then I'll get some sleep.",
        "Gus: I'm going to go outside.",
        "Harley: I love you.",
        "Buzz: I love you more.",
        "Michelle: You know, would it be so hard for people to actually give tony a chance?",
        "Mel: Michelle, tony is taking advantage of you.",
        "Michelle: Excuse me?",
        "Mel: Heoves into your life as soon as you move danny out. You have no idea what he's getting you into. Of course he wants to go into business with you, michelle. You are the perfect front woman. I mean, what kind of business is he going to run out of that restaurant? The lighthouse, for god's sake. I mean, a beautiful old building that has been in your family for years. A building that the whole town looks to as its guiding light. And what, it's going to be become some slick mob-run nightclub, or whatever? Michelle, you've got to think about what that means.",
        "Tony: Mel's right, michelle. Time for you to face reality and realize our partnership is a mistake, and I'm going to put an end to it right now. You happy, mel?",
        "Reva: You know something, sandy? You just dug yourself out of a big pile of trouble when you hacked into alan's computer.",
        "Sandy: Well, I'm not hacking this time, okay? I'm actually... I'm doing research. My job. I'm helping you prepare for your interview with phillip.",
        "Reva: Don't do me any favors. So did you find anything?",
        "Sandy: Actually, actually, not yet, but if you keep phillip busy for a while... (phone rings)",
        "Reva: Oh, wait a minute. Oh, it's marina. Hi, honey. What's up? He what? I knew it. Okay. I'm on my way. I'll be there in a minute or two. Okay, bye. Buzz cooper had a heart attack. He's at cedars. I'm going to head over there. You close up the computer and meet me there. I think marina could use a friend right now.",
        "Sandy: All right. I'll be there as soon as I shut down his computer.",
        "Reva: Okay. If you run into phillip on the way out, tell him that I'm going to have to reschedule the interview.",
        "Sandy: Roger that.",
        "Jeffrey: I don't want cassie to fall in love with me.",
        "Dinah: Right. Okay. So how you get her to fall in love with you is, first of all, get yourself attached to another woman as soon as possible. There's nothing more that cassie loves than an unavailable man. Now, the next thing, which you have down pat, is be a hero. Rush to her rescue a couple more times. That should be a major thrill for her. She should be on your lap in no time.",
        "Jeffrey: I'll say this again. I don't want her.",
        "Dinah: She'll never be enough for you. I think once you got stuck on that tabletop trash, you would be bored out of your skull. I think you need something complicated, a little more challenging.",
        "Cassie: I need jeffrey. Jeffrey. Jeffrey.",
        "Edmund: Cassie?",
        "Cassie: Jeffrey...",
        "Edmund: Cassie?",
        "Cassie: Edmund? Oh, my god, I was having the worst dream. This impostor, she was trying to smother me. And then I wanted to see her face, but then I... I was looking at me. It was my face. Oh, my god, it was so weird.",
        "Edmund: So you called out to jeffrey o'neill for help?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I guess I did.",
        "Edmund: Tell me, did he appear to you as a knight on a white horse?",
        "Cassie: I never saw him.",
        "Edmund: Well, I'm sorry i woke you too soon, before you could get to the \"jeffrey to the rescue\" part.",
        "Cassie: You rescued me, edmund. How did you know I was here?",
        "Edmund: What are you doing here, cassie?",
        "Cassie: Oh, I got a phone call from jeffrey's assistant. Told me to meet him here.",
        "Edmund: And so you just drop everything and run to meet the man in a hotel room?",
        "Cassie: I know it sounds weird, but he's weird. So...",
        "Edmund: Yeah. Well, that was said with fond amusement. Well, I guess I'll leave you two to your meeting.",
        "Cassie: Wait a minute. You don't have to go, edmund. You can stay.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I'm sorry, but every man has his breaking point. And I think this is mine. I just don't think I can stay here and watch the big event.",
        "Cassie: What event?",
        "Edmund: The moment you and jeffrey have been waiting for ever since you laid eyes on one another. Well, cassie, go to it. Give in. Just remember when you're in the throes of passion to call out the right name. Because it's jeffrey you're looking for, not richard.",
        "Jeffrey: It's time to walk away, dinah. Walk away from this obsession that you have.",
        "Dinah: You are as obsessed as you say that I am.",
        "Jeffrey: You know, you're so incredibly paranoid, but I can understand that. After all, the man that you really loved chose cassie over you, didn't he?",
        "Dinah: Thank you for making that so clear. You're right. Cassie... heck, I'm nothing compared to cassie. You know, I can see that now more and more clearly that I've come back to springfield. You're right about something else. I did put a little something in this drink. One sip and it would have been bye-bye jeffrey. And I think I thought that if i could get rid of you, I would get rid of all my problems. But I see now there's really probably only one way to fix what's wrong.",
        "Jeffrey: Dinah, no. Dinah! Dinah...",
        "Cassie: I cannot take any more of this, edmund.",
        "Edmund: I'm not blind, cassie. It's in front of me every single minute of every single day-- you and jeffrey o'neill.",
        "Cassie: Is this about jeffrey, or is this about the fact you have never forgiven me for accusing you of being involved with the salerno drug thing, huh?",
        "Edmund: Oh, one thing has nothing to do with the other.",
        "Cassie: I didn't trust you, okay? So what, you're turning the tables to teach me a lesson? Is that it?",
        "Edmund: That's not it, cassie. I can't stand this situation with you and jeffrey o'neill.",
        "Cassie: There is no situation, okay?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, you drop everything and run to the man every minute he calls, every time he calls, every time you need help.",
        "Cassie: Okay. I should have told you, okay? I should have told you. But I don't know, edmund. I know how you feel about him, and every single time I try to protect you, it blows up in my face.",
        "Edmund: You just don't see it, do you? You just don't see how drawn you are to jeffrey o'neill.",
        "Cassie: I am drawn to you, edmund. To you. I love you, okay? I love you. And all I care about is protecting you and making you happy. That's it. But you know what? I have proven my love for you over and over again, edmund. And if you don't believe in me enough, if you don't believe in us enough to keep us together, i have... no matter how many times I have been angry and I have been hurt, I have never walked out on you, and I have never even threatened to walk out on you. But every single time you're hurt and you're angry, you want to hit the door. And that's not fair. Now, you have to make a decision here. And if you decide that you can't believe in me enough to get over this crazy obsession that you have about me and jeffrey o'neill, then you walk out that door. But don't you look back.",
        "Gus: So what's going on? Were you just humoring your old man in there, or do we have another shot? Look, I'll do whatever you want me to do, okay? Whatever you need.",
        "Harley: What do I need? I need for you not to be a spaulding anymore. Or I need... I need you to want me to be your family as much as you want them. But I'm not going to get that, am I?",
        "Gus: You know, you didn't have your dad in your life for a very long time, and you got a second chance, right? Well, that's what I want. I mean, isn't that okay that i should want that?",
        "Harley: I made my father prove himself to me over and over again before I let him anywhere near my life. It was a long time before i could even consider trusting him, before I felt sure he wasn't going to run out on us again. Before I knew that I could count on him to tell me the truth. I need to count on you. That's what I need.",
        "Tony: You know, michelle, if you want light up and running, you have got to forget about the idea of you and I being a partner, okay? Please, forget it.",
        "Michelle: What are you doing, tony? One minute you're in, the next minute you're out. What is that?",
        "Tony: Well, you know, okay. It would have been fun, all right? It's your dream, michelle. It's not my dream.",
        "Michelle: No, no. I don't buy that. Not for one minute, tony.",
        "Tony: Well, you should.",
        "Michelle: Tony, I've seen the look on your face when we're going over those plans. You want this as much as I do. And that's okay. There's nothing wrong with going after what you want with everything you've got. That's living, isn't it? You're going after what you want, and not caring about what anyone else thinks or does. So I want the truth, santos. You want this as much as I do.",
        "Tony: Okay, yes. Yeah, I do, all right? I didn't want to admit it until now, but I do.",
        "Michelle: You want what, tony? What?",
        "Tony: I'm not sure if you're ready for this one, michelle.",
        "Michelle: So what? Say it anyway.",
        "Tony: Okay. I...",
        "Messenger: I'm looking for michelle santos.",
        "Michelle: That's me.",
        "Tony: How'd you know where to find her?",
        "Michelle: Oh, I left word with the guys at the lighthouse, the workers.",
        "Tony: Okay, here. Thanks a lot, man.",
        "Messenger: Thank you.",
        "Tony: Take care.",
        "Michelle: Wow. That's pretty cool. Who do you think this is from?",
        "Tony: Not me.",
        "Michelle: No? Tony, this is the permit. This is the permit to open light. This is it. This is all we need. How did this happen?",
        "Tony: I have no idea. Here. This might tell you what you need to know.",
        "Michelle: \"Dear michelle, hope this permit helps your dream to come true. Love, danny.\" What made him change his mind?",
        "Tony: Wants you to be happy.",
        "Michelle: I guess he does. I should call him. I've got to call him and thank him. Oh, you were saying something, tony. I'm sorry. What...",
        "Tony: No big deal. Nothing. Just call danny.",
        "Jeffrey: My god, dinah. Dinah...",
        "Dinah: (Barks) got you. See? You do care just a little bit.",
        "Jeffrey: That's good. That's really good. All right, that's it for you, okay? I'm going to personally put your butt on that plane.",
        "Dinah: Oh, I like it when you play rough.",
        "Jeffrey: Let's go. Game's over.",
        "Dinah: All right. All right. I will go. I will go. I just have one piece of advice for you. If you want cassie, that's fine. You'll probably get her. But you'd better be careful. All you'll ever be to her is a stand-in for the dead man you look like, and she will ruin you the way she's ruined every other man she's sunk her hooks into.",
        "Edmund: I'm not going to walk out on you, cassie. I'm going to fight for you. Besides, I tried once before, and I saw your face everywhere i looked.",
        "Cassie: Edmund, I love you. You. No, no, don'T. Leave it on. I want to see you. You, edmund.",
        "Buzz: Hello, gorgeous. Don't believe the rumors. I'm going to be just fine.",
        "Reva: Save it. I know you just wanted to see how fast I'd rush to your side.",
        "Buzz: Hey, if things go wrong, take care of my crew, okay?",
        "Reva: Of course I will. But you're not going to get out of this that easily.",
        "Buzz: Am I?",
        "Rick: All right. All right. Enough flirting, buzz. We've got some tests to run.",
        "Frank: Can we walk down with you?",
        "Rick: Sure.",
        "Frank: Thanks.",
        "Reva: You okay? I'm going to get you some coffee, okay? Coffee, coffee, coffee.",
        "Harley: Thanks.",
        "Reva: You want to come with me, mel?",
        "Mel: Yeah, I will.",
        "Reva: Okay. We'll be right back.",
        "Gus: It's funny how things happen. Maybe it's a sign or something, you know? A chance to get things right. Your dad's a very smart man. He thinks that we're going to do that, you know?",
        "Phillip: Harley, how's buzz? Is there anything that I can do?",
        "Harley: This is because of you. If you hadn'T... if you hadn't done this he wouldn't be in that hospital bed right now! How can you walk in here looking so innocent?",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Edmund: How rude of me. I only brought two glasses.",
        "Phillip: It's a contract relinquishing all of my rights to the property, to the land that company sits on.",
        "Gus: You know, just sign it and hand it over. Give it to me.",
        "Phillip: No, I think I've changed my mind."
