        "Lizzie: Man, our whole world has just completely turned upside down. It wasn't bad enough that Mom took away the family money, she had to go away and marry Granddad. Do you think she ever thought about how that would make us feel? You know what? We're going to make sure she does.",
        "Coop: ( Clears throat )",
        "Lizzie: Hi.",
        "Coop: Hi, yourself. What are you two fine young ladies doing out here?",
        "Lizzie: Waiting for you to come out here and cheer us up.",
        "Coop: Something tells me that you're already in a good mood.",
        "Lizzie: Let's just say I've been doing some thinking of my own.",
        "Coop: Oh, yeah? Like what?",
        "Lizzie: I'm not going to let my mom get to me anymore. I'm going to get even. Don't leave, though. We've got some plans to make. Mom?",
        "Beth: Lizzie, I am on my way to a hospital board meeting.",
        "Lizzie: I've been looking for you everywhere.",
        "Beth: If you are here to hurl more criticism at me for marrying Alan, I did what I thought was best for you and your brother. Lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: I can't do it, Mom. I can't do it anymore. You were right. I'm not ready for this. I want to come home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Have I already mentioned to you how well worth the wait this was?",
        "Danny: Once or twice. But feel free to keep telling me. You're doing wonders for my ego. Not to mention the rest of my body. ( Cell phone ringing )",
        "Marina: ( Groans ) Is that you or me?",
        "Danny: It's you, but don't answer it.",
        "Marina: I have to. If it's my instructor, I have to get it.",
        "Danny: No.",
        "Marina: ( Groans ) A cadet's work is never finished. Hello? Yes, sir. Yes, sir, I'll be right there.",
        "Danny: ( Groans ) No, no.",
        "Marina: I have to go.",
        "Danny: No.",
        "Marina: Yes! But I will call you...",
        "Danny: You've got a special assignment or something?",
        "Marina: ...When I'm done. I don't know, we'll see.",
        "Danny: You know, I am kind of warming up to this idea of you being a cop.",
        "Marina: Oh, yeah?",
        "Danny: Uh-huh. Because not only do you look incredibly hot and sexy in that uniform of yours, but I kind of like the idea of you being out there, spending all your time fighting crime, making up for all those years I caused it.",
        "Marina: Yeah. Well, I don't think I'm going to be fighting much crime today. More like practicing writing parking tickets.",
        "Danny: Okay. Either way, I'm such a lucky guy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Is there any way you can fit me in for an amnio this afternoon? Nope, I can do that. I can do that. Great. Thank you. Oh. Oh, and can you run a paternity test right away? Good, okay. The potential father? No. No, a blood sample is not going to be possible, but I do have a couple of strands of his hair. Is that going to be enough to do a DNA match? Great. Okay. Thanks, I'm on my way. ( Struggling with door )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Hey, Edmund. So, what the hell do you think you're doing in there?",
        "Michelle: There are ways to induce labor. I mean, laprosin is a commonly prescribed drug.",
        "Edmund: Uh, yes. Well, um, Rick, sorry, I've got a splitting headache and I just wanted to see if I could find some aspirin, but I didn't find any here. Let me ask the nurses at the station. Perhaps they could...",
        "Rick: Nice try.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Coop.",
        "Coop: Dad.",
        "Buzz: Mail. Postcard. From Harley.",
        "Coop: How?",
        "Buzz: Athens?",
        "Coop: Harley and Gus just left to go on their honeymoon.",
        "Buzz: \"Dearest Dad, Frank, Coop and Marina. Greetings from Greece. Well, okay, greetings from the airport en route to Greece. We're going to be having way too much fun on our honeymoon to write you, so this will have to do. Love to you and see you soon, Harley and Gus.\"",
        "Coop: Aw, that's so sweet. This is postdated, like, two days ago. They're nuts, Dad.",
        "Buzz: They're my kind of nuts. They're in love. Here's something for you.",
        "Coop: Hm? Oxford University? What? This says I've been accepted into the creative writing program at Oxford University. But I didn't even apply. How did this happen?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: You know, I tried to live on less money like the Coopers. I tried to have a budget. It was awful. I mean, I can't afford a pedicure, I can't afford a Grande skim half-hazelnut half-mocha latte and I'm behind on shopping for my fall clothes.",
        "Beth: Welcome to the real world, Lizzie. Maybe now you'll appreciate just how much your family has given you over the years.",
        "Lizzie: I do appreciate it. I swear I do, mom.",
        "Beth: Yes, well, it's too bad you didn't realize this sooner.",
        "Lizzie: Mom?",
        "Beth: At Gus and Harley's wedding, I told you that if you weren't careful, when you finally realized that you wanted to come back to us, it might just be too late.",
        "Lizzie: But you're saying that now that I want to come back home you're not going to let me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: I have to go.",
        "Danny: No, no, no.",
        "Marina: I do. I do.",
        "Danny: Come on, can't the jaywalkers go free for a day?",
        "Marina: No.",
        "Danny: Come on. Can't you call in sick?",
        "Marina: No.",
        "Danny: Please? Maybe car trouble?",
        "Marina: ( Laughs ) No. I cannot lie to the cops. But it is good to know that you'll miss me.",
        "Danny: I will.",
        "Marina: I will call you when I'm done.",
        "Danny: Hey. Be careful. ( Cell phone ringing )",
        "Danny: This is Danny Santos. Yeah, I'm Robbie's dad. Why? Is he okay? He's homesick? He told me that he was loving day camp. What happened? His mother called him. Hm. And he misses her. Okay. Yeah, no, I understand. I'll come right over and pick him up. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: I'm sorry, Rick. Is there a problem?",
        "Rick: Only authorized personnel are allowed in that medicine cabinet, for starters.",
        "Edmund: Really? Because it was open. It wasn't locked.",
        "Rick: It was open? Is that supposed to be a joke?",
        "Edmund: Look, Rick, if I've done something wrong, I apologize, but I've had a splitting headache. I've had it all day long and I'm just desperate to get rid of it. I don't know whether it's worrying about the baby coming or if something's going to go wrong, I don't know. You know what that's like.",
        "Rick: Me and every other man who's a father. So you're telling me you were looking for aspirin.",
        "Edmund: Yes. I just... I couldn't find any, so if I went to the nurse's desk...",
        "Rick: Then what's this in your hand?",
        "Edmund: Rick.",
        "Rick: Hydrocodone. This is a very powerful prescription pain reliever you have here.",
        "Edmund: It's a bad headache.",
        "Rick: It's also very addictive, so why don't you just tell me how long you've been hooked on this stuff?",
        "Edmund: ( Laughs ) I'm not hooked, Rick.",
        "Rick: Only an addict steals medicine from a hospital.",
        "Edmund: Okay, okay, okay. Look, I was in a boating accident in San Cristobel a few years ago. I really hurt my back and the doctor prescribed me this stuff, and it's just...",
        "Rick: And when it came time to stop, you did what?",
        "Edmund: I couldn't. God, I couldn't. I tried, Rick. I have cut down. I am so weak.",
        "Rick: Well, listen, I can certainly relate. I had a problem with prescription pills many years ago.",
        "Edmund: Then you understand. I mean...",
        "Rick: I understand you've got to find a way to quit. This stuff will cause liver damage, kidney damage.",
        "Edmund: I want to quit. I do, Rick. I want to quit. But just one.",
        "Rick: Okay, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to give you the number of a rehab center. It's very good. It's also very discreet.",
        "Edmund: Okay. I appreciate this, Rick.",
        "Rick: Make sure you call them. Listen, don't think that you can do this by yourself.",
        "Edmund: I don't.",
        "Rick: Don't think that you can put this off. I want you to call them right away.",
        "Edmund: I will. I will, Rick. Thank you. Thank you. ( Key jingling )",
        "Rick: Edmund, I want you to call them, okay? Because when I get back to my office, I'm going to call the clinic and I'm going to tell them that I referred you to them, so if you don't show up, I'll know about it.",
        "Edmund: I'll call. I'll call, Rick. Thank you. Thanks very much. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: I don't believe this. ( Sighs ) Hi, I'm in suite 625 and I can't get my door open. I've tried everything; it just won't budge. Can you guys send somebody up here, please? Great, because I have to run to a doctor's appointment in Clayton. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: \"Laprosin\". Ooh, a warning. \"Controlled substance. Professional medical use only. For stage one labor induction.\" Well, thank you, Dr. Bauer. You and your sister have been very helpful.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: You're late, Cooper.",
        "Marina: I am not. I'm five minutes early. But I like the attempt at being the hard-line CO.",
        "Mallet: Well, I am your CO-- chief's orders-- and don't you forget it. What is that? Stand up tall when you do that, cadet, or I'll make sure you never graduate from the academy.",
        "Marina: Yeah, okay. So what's my duty for the day? You going to put me on animal control or sanitation compliance? I know if my dad had his way I'd be spending the rest of my career behind a desk.",
        "Mallet: Well, this assignment is not from your dad. And anyway, I told Frank that if he wanted a supervisor that was going to coddle his daughter, he's got the wrong guy because I think you've got a little bit of your aunt in you. So if I did chain you to a desk, you would just drag it out into the street and start whacking bad guys with it. Right?",
        "Marina: You do know us Cooper women well.",
        "Mallet: Yes, I do. Now listen, here's the deal: I'm going to treat you like any other cadet on my watch, okay? But you're going to have to wipe that smile off your face and you're going to have to refer to me as \"Sir.\"",
        "Marina: Yes, Sir.",
        "Mallet: At least in public, okay? You got that?",
        "Marina: Yes.",
        "Mallet: Okay.",
        "Marina: So, are you going to send me on a real assignment? What is it? Is it, like, a drug bust or a stakeout?",
        "Mallet: No, actually... I need you to look hot and flirt with a guy in a bar.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: There must have been another Henry Bradshaw that applied.",
        "Buzz: No, there's no other Henry Bradshaw. The work that Mr. Amis was so impressed with was yours. I picked five of your best stories and sent them off to Oxford with an application.",
        "Coop: You what?",
        "Buzz: Well, you know, I tried to tell you how talented you are. I thought maybe if you heard from your idol then maybe you'd finally believe it.",
        "Coop: Wait a minute. You're telling me that this-- that this-- all this, right here, is real? That I'm actually going to a creative writing seminar that I was accepted to that Martin Amis is teaching himself, at... ( Cheers )",
        "Buzz: Oxford.",
        "Coop: Oxford University, Dad!",
        "Buzz: That's about the size of it, yeah.",
        "Coop: Oh, my... come here. I don't know what to say. I... whoa. Whoa. Oh, no.",
        "Buzz: What's wrong?",
        "Coop: Well, it starts soon and I'd be gone for the entire semester.",
        "Buzz: I know. You're going to spend four months doing the work that you love to do. What could be better than that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: If you want to come home just so you can have a credit card again and you're not going to change, let's not bother.",
        "Lizzie: I don't know what you want.",
        "Beth: I want you to be safe. I want you to be a part of your family again.",
        "Lizzie: No, you want me to grovel. You want me to say how right you were and how wrong I was, and \"Oh yeah, mom, I'm sorry, I swear I've learned my lesson.\" I have. Okay, I have learned my lesson, and I know, I'm sorry if I've been a brat. It's just finding out that you married Granddad just... it really freaked me out.",
        "Beth: I know it did.",
        "Lizzie: But, I mean, couldn't you have given me a warning or something? Did you just have to tell me after it was already a done deal?",
        "Beth: I wanted to tell you, Lizzie, but you weren't speaking to me then, remember?",
        "Lizzie: Mom, it's not even the fact that you married Granddad. It's that... you know, when I think of him locked up, then I think of Daddy locked up, and that just makes me so sad. And I really miss him. And then I start to miss you, and I miss Nana and James and I just wish it could all be like it was before Daddy...",
        "Beth: I know. I know, Sweetie. Of course you can come back home. And I miss you, too. And I know it's hard for you to understand me marrying your grandfather, but I did it to protect you and James now and forever. Okay? Do you understand that, Sweetie?",
        "Salesman: Excuse me? Lizzie Spaulding? I'm...",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I know who you are. Could you just give me a minute, over there, please? Thanks.",
        "Beth: What was that all about?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, that was just from WSPR. He had papers for me to fill out before I start my job. So I can really move in tonight?",
        "Beth: The sooner the better.",
        "Lizzie: Look, I might need a little bit of pocket money because I need to get a new outfit for my first week of work.",
        "Beth: You don't need pocket money, Lizzie. I told you that if you moved back home, I'd write you a blank check, and I meant it.",
        "Lizzie: That is so generous of you, Mom. Thank you so much.",
        "Beth: No, thank you. Thank you for being smart and for making the right decision. Now, I am going to be late for this board meeting, so here you go. I love you.",
        "Lizzie: I love you, too.",
        "Beth: And I'll see you at home.",
        "Lizzie: So, what do you have to show me?",
        "Salesman: Ballpark, how much would you like to spend?",
        "Lizzie: Money is no factor in this. I just need an engagement ring that should make my mom's eyes pop out of her head. ( Laughs )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: I cannot miss this appointment. I have to know who the father is. Come on. ( Rattling door ) ( Sighs ) ( Baby cooing )",
        "Michelle: ( Sighs ) Hi, it's suite 625 again. How much longer is it going to be before someone... ( Someone fiddling with lock ) No, never mind. Thank you. Hello? Hi, it's the right room. I'm trapped in here. I can't get the door open. Can you open it? Oh, thank goodness. I don't know what was wrong.",
        "Edmund: Michelle? What's going on? Are you all right?",
        "Michelle: No. I couldn't get the door open. It's been stuck shut. I actually thought you were the hotel maintenance.",
        "Edmund: Stuck shut? How on earth did that happen?",
        "Michelle: I have no idea, but I'm glad you got here when you did because I am going to be late.",
        "Edmund: Late for what?",
        "Michelle: I scheduled an amnio and a DNA test so I can find out who the father is.",
        "Edmund: Hold on, Michelle. You can't go.",
        "Michelle: What did you just say to me?",
        "Edmund: Well, I'm sorry Michelle, but do you really want to do this? Have you thought this thing through?",
        "Michelle: Finding out who the father is?",
        "Edmund: No, no. Having an amnio to do it. Please, sit over there. The risks involved...",
        "Michelle: I am very well aware of the risks, Edmund. I was a medical professional, remember?",
        "Edmund: Well, of course. It's just after what happened to Dinah. I mean, she had an amnio and she almost lost the baby. She had the amnio, she went immediately into contractions and it was just very... it was touch and go there for a while.",
        "Michelle: Wow, that's really scary.",
        "Edmund: It was terrifying.",
        "Michelle: But I thought Dinah was going to have to be induced. Isn't that what you were...?",
        "Edmund: Well, now. Now. But before, the baby almost came early and now the baby's coming late. This whole pregnancy has just been one ridiculous roller coaster. My point is, is that you think you've weighed the risks of an amnio but when something goes wrong, it is really hard to live with.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, but you know what? I'm almost full term, and-- knock on wood-- my pregnancy has been textbook perfect.",
        "Edmund: Right. Well, then why tempt fate? Just wait until you give birth and then do the paternity test.",
        "Michelle: ( Groans ) I'm just going crazy not knowing the truth.",
        "Edmund: Well, I just don't see why you can't endure a little more uncertainty, especially if your child's health is at risk. You know, that's... I'm sorry, that's just wrong of me. That's wrong, forgive me. It's not my place to judge. Whatever decision you make is going to be the right decision.",
        "Michelle: Just, I really need to know. But maybe I am being selfish.",
        "Edmund: Oh, you're not being selfish, Michelle. You're not being selfish. You're just exhausted. Please, you look exhausted. At the very least, far too exhausted to make a decision like this. So please, I think the best thing to do is lie down. If you want to, you can reschedule it later on. Just lie down now. When you wake up, you'll have a new perspective on it.",
        "Michelle: I am kind of tied. You know, maybe I will lay down for a little bit, you know? But I have to call the doctor first.",
        "Edmund: No, don't worry. I'll take care of it. Consider it done. Where's the number?",
        "Michelle: It's over there on that pad.",
        "Edmund: Good, good. I'll call the doctor, you lie down. I will take care of everything, all right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: All right, Buddy.",
        "Robbie: I want Mommy.",
        "Danny: Yeah, I know you do. I know you do. And I'm going to find her, I promise, okay? Excuse me. Do you know where...",
        "Rick: Hey, guy. Hey, Robbie. What are you doing here, young fellow? You're supposed to be in camp. What's the...",
        "Danny: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Lizzie? Lizzie, can you do me a favor and watch Robbie for just two minutes?",
        "Lizzie: Sure.",
        "Danny: Two minutes, Buddy. Here, why don't you come and sit with Lizzie, and remember the doggy? Remember Roxy? Why don't you play with Roxy for a minute. I'll be right back.",
        "Rick: What's going on?",
        "Danny: Somewhere we can talk?",
        "Rick: Let's... in here.",
        "Danny: Thanks.",
        "Rick: So what's going on?",
        "Danny: Well, Robbie was supposed to be at camp, but then Michelle called him and I guess he got homesick. I had to go out there and pick him up.",
        "Rick: Oh, this poor little guy.",
        "Danny: Yeah, Rick, Michelle hasn't even seen Robbie since she's been back. I mean, where the hell is she? Is she staying with you and Mel, or what?",
        "Rick: No, no. We don't know where she's staying.",
        "Danny: What? That's ridiculous. I mean, what is this? She doesn't return my calls. She doesn't tell me where she is. What if there was some kind of emergency? It's like she's avoiding me on purpose.",
        "Rick: Maybe she is.",
        "Danny: Why?",
        "Rick: Why wouldn't she, Danny? I mean, maybe this is awkward for her, and for you, too, to adjust to this new circumstance of being divorced, you know? And then she's got to see you with Marina. That's tough.",
        "Danny: I understand that. I do, I get it. But Robbie needs both of his parents. He is our number-one priority and Michelle needs to put these other feelings aside and deal with that. We just can't... it's not like we can keep avoiding this.",
        "Rick: Avoiding what, exactly?",
        "Danny: Look, just when you hear from her or when you see her, will you tell her to call me? Please, please, please.",
        "Rick: Sure.",
        "Danny: Tell her that Robbie needs his mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: That's... that's adequately slutty.",
        "Marina: Well, you told me to look available. So, who is this guy?",
        "Mallet: His name is Brett Roth.",
        "Marina: This is the big, scary criminal? He looks like a frat boy from Springfield U.",
        "Mallet: Well, he was up until last year-- a frat boy who was really, really handy on the computers. He was making fake IDs for his frat brothers and actually really good ones.",
        "Marina: Okay, so he's making fake licenses, selling them to kids so they can get into bars. That's the big sting?",
        "Mallet: Well, that's how his business grew, and then word got out on the street that he was the best, and now we hear he's making fake IDs for real criminals, bad guys, guys we've got to get off the streets.",
        "Marina: Okay, so you don't necessarily want to nab him, you want him to roll over on his customers.",
        "Mallet: Yeah. Yeah, smart girl. Roth is at Outskirts Bar right now. Sherman's there, undercover, so he'll watch your back.",
        "Marina: Okay, so you just want me to go in, flirt with him, get him to sell me a fake ID?",
        "Mallet: That's right. As soon as he does, signal Sherman and we'll grab him.",
        "Marina: Done.",
        "Mallet: Okay. Now, listen. Be careful, okay? We don't know if he's particularly violent, but we don't think he is, but be careful.",
        "Marina: It's not a problem. I got it.",
        "Mallet: Okay. Now, just take it easy. It's your first assignment, you'll be a little pumped. Slow down. Make sure he comes to you. And listen, don't try to be a hero on this, okay, or you'll blow it. And whatever you do, stay in Sherman's line of sight. Get it?",
        "Marina: Got it.",
        "Mallet: Good. Now, don't worry about getting this guy tonight, okay?",
        "Marina: Mallet...",

        "Coop: Please do.",
        "Buzz: You had a lot going on when you first came here, you know? A lot of good stuff. And then I had my heart attack and Harley got arrested, and I don't know what would have happened if you hadn't been here for all of us. But now the family is sort of on track again and you can grab at your dreams and let them take you where they're going to go. Okay? Look, I know I shouldn't have sent that off...",
        "Coop: No, no, no. Pops, stop. Look, this... this is amazing. You have no... oh.",

        "Marina: No, but could you do me a huge favor and pretend that you do, and get me a drink? I'll pay for it and all. It's just, I'm underage.",
        "Brett: You are? You don't look like you're underage.",
        "Marina: Yeah, that's what they all say. ( Laughter )",
        "Marina: So, my mom's, like, \"You walk out that door, Lindsay, it is closing behind you.\" And I was, like, \"That's fine with me,\" right? So I've been on my own ever since, doing whatever I want, all the things that she would never let me do.",
        "Brett: And what are those?",
        "Marina: Well, like having fun. Lots of it. I don't know. It's kind of hard, though, when you're getting carded all the time.",

        "Coop: Yes, I'm sure it will fly by, but I haven't decided to go yet. So I would please ask you that I be the one to tell her myself. Please.",

I just picked up my son Robbie a little while ago, and I'm on my way to meet my ex-wife with Robbie, but I'm kind of running late and I've misplaced her number. And I'm really sorry to bother you, but I was hoping maybe... do you guys by chance have caller ID on your phone? You do? That'd be... well, great. Thank you. The Towers Hotel. Oh, no, no, no. Okay, no, no, no. That's great. That's all I need to know. Thank you so much. Hey. Okay, here's what I'm going to do.

        "Michelle: I'd give anything to share this time with Danny, too. ( Laughs ) It's funny. Whoever would have thought we'd have so much in common? But, you know, babies do that. They change the way you look at everything. They come into this world and they turn it upside down.",
