        "Gus: You rang? Oh, my God. Are you at this\r\nagain? ",
        "Mallet: What, did you think I was going to give up? I'm not giving up. There's a reason\r\nJeffrey is Dinah\u2019s new best\r\nfriend. ",
        "Gus: Sure. When the trailer's a rockin', don't come a knockin'. \r\n",
        "Mallet: I told you it's not about sex, okay?\r\nShe's holding something over his head. She's got something on him. I mean,\r\nthat's the reason he protected her after the fire. ",
        "Gus: You keep poking around,\r\nyou're going to be visiting your girlfriend in state prison. ",
        "Mallet: That's what I'm talking about. She\r\nmay already be in trouble. Man, what are you hiding, O\u2019Neill?\r\nAnd what do you want with my girl? ",

        "Dinah: It's a bar. ",
        "Jeffrey: Did you see Alan-Michael?\r\n",
        "Dinah: He looks good. I held up my end of\r\nthe bargain and am getting you the Spaulding\r\nendorsement. ",
        "Jeffrey: And I'm holding up my end of the\r\nbargain: You're not in jail. ",
        "Dinah: You still have evidence against me? ",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, I think I'm going to\r\nhold onto that for a little while. ",

        "Jeffrey: Everything's going to be fine. ",
        "Dinah: Oh, really? You want to tell that to Mallet?\r\n",
        "Jeffrey: Why don't you just go back to him?\r\nWe both know you want to. ",
        "Dinah: Well, I would, but he doesn't trust\r\nme. And I'm very happy where I'm at. Sir, can I get another, please. ",

        "Alan: Well, I find things here and there.\r\nBesides, I'm having a lot of fun doing it. ",
        "Beth: I can see that. You seem to be in a\r\ngood mood. ",
        "Alan: Well, I am. My wife and I are together\r\nagain, and we have the same goal. ",
        "Beth: Does that mean my plan is underway? ",
        "Alan: Yes, your plan is under way. Elizabeth\r\nis on her way home, so she and the baby will be where they belong very shortly.\r\n",
        "Beth: And all I have to do is make my\r\ndaughter seem crazy. ",
        "Alan: Seem crazy, but she's not. Beth, it\r\nhas all been worth it. Loading the gun with blanks, putting the bars on the\r\nnursery... ",
        "Beth: You did all of that? ",
        "Alan: Yes, I did that to save Lizzie from a life with Randall,\r\nand I have no regrets. ",

        "Lizzie: Get to me? What's it called, a protective custody? Do you know what that means, Tammy? \r\n",
        "Tammy: That means they're trying to take\r\naction to keep the baby safe. ",
        "Lizzie: It means that they can lock me up as\r\nlong as I'm pregnant. It means they can go after the baby once it's born. ",
        "Jonathan: No, no, we're not going to go\r\nthere. Tonight was supposed to be a good night, and Alan\r\nis not going to ruin it. Lizzie, you're going to be safe. Tammy, you and I are\r\nstill getting married. ",
        "Lizzie: No. No, you guys can't do that. I'm\r\nnot stupid, Tammy. I get that you guys are in love,\r\nbut what happens to me if you get married? ",
        "Jonathan: It has nothing to do with you. ",
        "Lizzie: Did you read those papers? They're\r\ntrying to prove I'm in a bad place with my baby. If you're married, I'm all\r\nalone. ",

        "Jonathan: Have we let you down so far? ",
        "Lizzie: No. I'm just scared, okay? When he\r\nwants something, he goes after it. He wants our baby. ",
        "Jonathan: Well, he's not going to get her.\r\nOkay. ",
        "Lizzie: Do you really mean that? Really? ",

        "Man: And just who are you, Dinah, his campaign manager? \r\n",
        "Dinah: Well, you could say that, something\r\nlike that. I actually think it's my job now to spread the word about Mr. O\u2019Neill. How do you think I'm\r\ndoing at spreading the word? ",
