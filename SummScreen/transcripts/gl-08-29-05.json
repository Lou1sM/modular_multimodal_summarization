        "Alan: Well, is it visiting hours already? ",
        "Beth: I slipped the guards a little money.\r\nIt extends hours. ",
        "Alan: Yes, it looks like you've been\r\nshopping, as well. ",
        "Beth: ( Laughs ) I brought you some more\r\nbooks. ",

        "Beth: You are the \"Master and Commander.\"\r\n",
        "Alan: Any news from the outside world? ",
        "Beth: Good news. ",
        "Alan: Hm? ",
        "Beth: I convinced Lizzie to come home. All\r\nit took was some minor arm twisting and... ",
        "Alan: A little cash incentive? ",
        "Beth: You know your granddaughter. ",
        "Alan: ( Laughs ) I sure do. ",
        "Beth: It's good to see you, Alan. You're the\r\nonly person I can really talk to these days. ",
        "Alan: Likewise. Of course, isn't that what a\r\ngood marriage is all about? ",
        "Alexandra: So, it's true? You two... you two\r\nare, what, married? ",
        "Alan: Alexandra, did you come here to\r\ncongratulate us? ",
        "Alexandra: Have you both gone crazy? Both? ",
        "Alan: Well, if we have, we're in the right\r\nplace. ",

        "Lizzie: No, actually, you're supposed to... ",

        "Mallet: Listen, Sherman, it's Mallet. I want\r\nyou to keep your line open while you're backing up Marina Cooper tonight, okay?\r\nAnd if anything looks wonky on her undercover gig, I want my phone to ring.\r\nGreat. Thank you. ",
        "Buzz: \"Wonky?\" I don't like the\r\nsound of that. Is everything okay? Dinner okay? ",
        "Mallet: Yeah, it was great. I'm fine. And\r\nyour concern is touching, Buzz. Thank you. ",
        "Buzz: I know. That phone call, with the\r\npolice stuff: Serious? ",
        "Mallet: No, no. It's actually just kind of\r\nroutine stuff, actually. ",
        "Buzz: Frank keeping you busy? ",
        "Mallet: Yes, yes. You know Frank. ",
        "Buzz: He says it's great to have you back. ",

        "Marina: ( Struggles ) Where did you learn to\r\nkiss like that? The fifth grade? I came out here for some fake ID, not to get\r\nall manhandled. ",
        "Brett: You're going to get both. What are\r\nyou looking at? Nobody's out here. Nobody's going to see anything. ",
        "Marina: Look, I came out here with somebody\r\nso if you don't get your hands off of me right now... ",

        "Michelle: Ow! What was that? ",

        "Brett: What is that? Some kind of good\r\nadvice? What are you waiting for? Your superhero to come down here and save\r\nyou? ",
        "Marina: Look, I don't even know why I'm\r\ntrying to be nice to you. You're the one who's going to need the saving, not\r\nme. ",
        "Brett: Ow! ( Groaning ) ",
        "Sherman: Cooper, you okay? ",

        "Sherman: You look like it got a little\r\nrough. ",
        "Marina: Yeah, well, some people just don't\r\nseem to understand that no means no. Why don't you read him his rights? I'm\r\ngoing to call Detective Mallet. ",

        "Marina: Don't worry about it, okay? But you\r\nowe me one. ( Cell phone ringing ) ",

        "Coop: No... Lizzie, where did you even get\r\nthis? ",
        "Lizzie: I didn't steal it, if that's what\r\nyou're thinking. I don't get why it's so hard for you to just say those magic\r\nwords and let us just do it. Put it on my hand. ",
        "Coop: Lizzie, you asked... you really want\r\nus to get married? ",
        "Lizzie: Um, yes. But you have to say that\r\nword, not me. ",
        "Coop: Come on. I mean, we can barely go to\r\nthe movies without trying to strangle each other. ",
        "Lizzie: Or rip each other's clothes off. Do\r\nyou know what that is? What you said and what I just said? That's love. That's\r\npassion. It's like wanting to kill someone, but it's marriage. ",
        "Coop: Whoa. Whoa. ",
        "Lizzie: Coop, we belong together. Why do you\r\nkeep denying that? ",
        "Coop: Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Okay. Now, I like the\r\nsound of that, but honestly, that's sounding a lot like revenge, too. ",
        "Lizzie: You think I'm going to try to get\r\nrevenge, get even with you by marrying you and then making you miserable or\r\nsomething? ",
        "Coop: No. Like maybe getting even with your\r\nmom and your grandfather, and you're just using me to do it. ",

        "Alan: No, not at all. ",
        "Alexandra: Is this insanity contagious? Or\r\nis there just one shred of common sense maybe I could appeal to. ",
        "Alan: I have treasured Beth for quite some\r\ntime. You know that. I loved her as a daughter-in- law. Why can't I love her in\r\na different way? ",
        "Alexandra: Oh, my God. ",
        "Alan: Look, she has always put our family\r\ninterest ahead of her own. Now, she's had her trouble, of course-- we all have\r\nhad our troubles-- but I want this family to heal, and I will heal it any way I\r\ncan.\u00a0 Ok ",
        "Beth: And I do love Alan. ",

        "Alexandra: Lillian is happy? ( Laughs ) Happy\r\nabout being Alan\u2019s mother- in-law? I doubt that very much. ",
        "Beth: She wants me to be safe and happy. And\r\nAlan was speaking from the heart in there. All he wants is for everyone to\r\nheal. ",
        "Alexandra: What do you hope to get out of\r\nthis, Beth? ",
        "Beth: Both Alan and I are very happy with\r\nthis arrangement. ",

        "Danny: Edmund, why are you... why are you\r\nsweating? ",
        "Edmund: Oh, sweating? The, uh... the air\r\nconditioning in my room shut off. I called maintenance to do something about\r\nit, but they haven't come up here. ",
        "Danny: You want me to take a look at it? ",
        "Edmund: Thanks, Danny, but you are no home\r\nrepairman. ",

        "Marina: Enjoy jail. ",
        "Mallet: I just talked to Sherman. Did you\r\ntake this guy down by yourself? ",
        "Marina: Yeah, but I really didn't have a\r\nchoice. He wanted to go outside. ",
        "Mallet: And you went? You went with him? ",
        "Marina: Well, he said he had his equipment\r\nin the car. I don't know, that's what he said. Anyway, if you can't bust him on\r\nfake IDs, you can definitely bust him on something else now. ",
        "Mallet: Listen to me. Don't ever, ever\r\nsacrifice yourself like this again. Not for a bust, not for the department, not\r\nfor anything or anyone. You understand? ",

I liked him a lot and I really wanted him to like me, too, but I didn't\r\neven think he would know my name. He was older and he was one of those guys who\r\ncould have any girl he wanted. But he asked me out. And I was so excited. We\r\nwent out and had a great time. He was really nice. And then we got to the end\r\nof the night and I thought it was okay. I just gave him a kiss goodnight and.\r\nhe just wanted more. A lot more. And so he, um... he took what he wanted. ",

The point is, you\r\ncan't let what happened tonight come between you and Danny. Okay? You love the\r\nguy and that's all you need. You remember that. ",
