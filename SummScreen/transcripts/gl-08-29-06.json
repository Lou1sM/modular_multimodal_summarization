        "Mallet: Hm. Oh, man, I thought I was dreaming last night, you showed up at my door. Hm.",
        "Dinah: If you were dreaming, then so am I.",
        "Mallet: I don't know what made you come back to my door, but, um, even if it's just for a night, I don't care. I don't need to know. I'm just glad that you did. And I want it to happen again and again, and again.",
        "Jeffrey: If Mallet sees that file and finds out the truth, your insurance policy goes out the window because I won't be able to keep you out of prison anymore.",
        "Mallet: What's up?",
        "Dinah: I can't do this.",
        "Mallet: Why, what's the matter?",
        "Dinah: I just can't do this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Okay, I checked the lobby and the street. No sign of Alan or any of his goons. We should be able to get out of town before they even know we're gone.",
        "Lizzie: No, no, no. Granddad is always two steps ahead of us. I mean if he even sniffs that we're trying to bail out--",
        "Tammy: We'll do everything on the sly: Rent a car under a fake name...",
        "Jonathan: I have fake IDs at the bar we can use for that and we also should probably set up some kind a fake trail or something to throw Alan off, lie clues whatever...",
        "Lizzie: Okay, so what are we going to do for money? I can only get so much.",
        "Jonathan: Granddaughter of one of the richest men in the world. You ought to have your own jet.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, well, with my family, everything comes with a price.",
        "Tammy: I could pawn my engagement ring. Well, we're going to need cash, and Alan can track a credit card.",
        "Jonathan: Wow. Where did you learn to think like that?",
        "Tammy: From the master.",
        "Jonathan: (Laughs)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Ow, damnit! Ow-- oh.",
        "Cassie: What-- what the heck? What happened? Are you okay?",
        "Josh: Oh, man. When am I going to learn, huh? Why can't I just be like a normal human being and hire somebody when I need something fixed?",
        "Cassie: I don't know. You probably said, no, no, no H.B. would fix it himself.",
        "Josh: Yeah, back in the days of the horse and buggy.",
        "Cassie: I see. These hands are good for something, huh?",
        "Josh: (Laughs) I thought we decided we were going to keep our distance from each other-- at least until we worked out some things with R.J.",
        "Cassie: That was the plan, yes. And plans change.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: (Laughs) I see it didn't work.",
        "Reva: What didn't?",
        "Billy: Well, I thought a good night sleep and maybe you'd change your mind about leaving New York.",
        "Reva: Nope. You want to know why?",
        "Billy: Uh-huh.",
        "Reva: Because I didn't sleep. Who can sleep the night before battle?",
        "Billy: How about a couple more days?",
        "Reva: No. I've got to go, Billy. Because I've got to go back there and start kicking some butt, starting with my sister's out of my husband's bed. Or vice versa, whoever's butt's closest.",
        "Billy: Okay. Whoa, whoa, hey, hey. Okay.",
        "Reva: Got it?",
        "Bill: Kick butt, huh? Okay, let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I don't know what there is to talk about. We've got to get out of here before Alan finds out what we're doing.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, we do. But you're not going to pawn your engagement ring to finance the trip.",
        "Tammy: I know how much it means to you.",
        "Jonathan: Well, I've never put an engagement ring on somebody's finger before. So, yeah, it means something.",
        "Tammy: So does the life of your baby.",
        "Lizzie: I did give the ring to you, so it's not too sentimental.",
        "Jonathan: True. It took three of us to get engaged, and three of us to decide to skip town--",
        "Tammy: Only two of you to make the baby in the first place.",
        "Lizzie: Wow, that's silenced the crowd.",
        "Tammy: Sorry.",
        "Jonathan: What I was going to say is that I'm surprised between the three of us, we can't scratch up enough money to get out of here. I'm gonna sell my bike.",
        "Lizzie: You would do that?",
        "Tammy: No. No way. It means too much to you.",
        "Jonathan: You mean more, and so does the kid.",
        "Lizzie: (Clears throat)",
        "Jonathan: And I wouldn't be doing this if you weren't a friend, and, you know, obviously the mother of my child. Are you ready?",
        "Lizzie: Yes, I uh... almost--",
        "Jonathan: Would you put down the phone.",
        "Lizzie: I'm hungry! I'm almost finished packing my bags.",
        "Jonathan: Bags as in plural?",
        "Lizzie: I only brought the bare minimum. Six bags, not including Roxy's.",
        "Jonathan: We're trying to sneak out of town, not go on safari!",
        "Lizzie: Fine.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. Heads up, too, good call on the using cash instead of credit card to throw Alan off.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, well it'll keep him off or trail for a little while, anyway.",
        "Jonathan: True. I'll start planting the fake clues when I go to the bar to pick up the IDs. You have to go see your mom.",
        "Tammy: Really?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, you didn't think I'd let you leave town without saying good- bye to her?",
        "Tammy: Thank you, thank you. She's gonna miss me. But she'll be okay, now that she has someone else in her life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Hey.",
        "Cassie: Hey. I've got to be the worst mother on the planet.",
        "Josh: That can't be true. Second, third, maybe fifth, something like that.",
        "Cassie: I'm serious.",
        "Josh: Okay. How's R.J.?",
        "Cassie: Oh, he's great, if you don't mind the fact that he's lock himself in the car and refuses to go to New York with us.",
        "Josh: I don't know if I'd put that in the category of great. It sounds like he's still uh... what, upset about what Hawk said about us?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Not that he's saying it. He's just climbed into a shell. He's barely talked to me at all since he found out that we're... an item. I don't know, the only adult he says anything good about is his father, who he then has to call Richard, he says, \"But Richard isn't really my father.\"",
        "Josh: And that's somehow your responsibility or...",
        "Cassie: You know what, I just feel like a-- I feel like a bit of a tramp, okay? I really do.",
        "Josh: Cassie... Cassie, come on.",
        "Cassie: My son is practically throwing it in my face.",
        "Josh: No, no. He's just hurting.",
        "Cassie: I could just kick Hawk for dumping it all in R.J.'s lap.",
        "Josh: Oops.",
        "R.J.: Excuse me, but are we going to go or not?",
        "Josh: (Whispering) At least he still has his manners. Okay, we're going. It's you and me, R.J. come on, you and I are going some place. We'll be back. See you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Maybe last night wasn't as great as I remember it.",
        "Dinah: Sex has never been a problem. 99% of the other time we spend with each other, we're having trouble with.",
        "Mallet: Oh, that's not true.",
        "Dinah: Well, honey, last night was wonderful. It is always wonderful with you.",
        "Mallet: Uh-huh. But, yet, your going.",
        "Dinah: Well, I came over here because I was lonely and I was feeling sorry for myself, and I didn't want to spend another night alone.",
        "Mallet: Oh, please, just stop. Would you just stop. You know, all of the stuff we've put each other through, you know, the mistakes and the heartbreak, it's just junk a man and woman put it each other through--",
        "Dinah: You know what, you can go through a whole speech--",
        "Mallet: We have something. We have something really special. And I am talking about the 99%. I'm not talking about the sex. Anyway, if you don't want long speeches, that's fine. I'll just make it short and sweet, okay. Hey, I've never stopped loving you. I mean you drive my frickin' crazy, but I've never stopped. And I know you haven't stopped loving me. And I know you don't want to go right now. I know that. I can feel that.",
        "Dinah: I don't want last night to be our last time, okay?",
        "Mallet: Okay. That's good. Okay.",
        "Dinah: Okay. But not if we screw it up.",
        "Mallet: We're not going to screw it up.",
        "Dinah: You can't promise me that.",
        "Mallet: I can promise you that I won't give up on us.",
        "Dinah: All right. You know what, go take a shower, put on your cape and tights, and we'll discuss it over breakfast, okay?",
        "Mallet: Join me in the bat cage?",
        "Dinah: Breakfast. Shower, go.",
        "Mallet: Dinah, I want to say one--",
        "Dinah: Ah. One step at a time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Well, you managed to ruin one of the most magical nights of my life. Are you happy?",
        "Jeffrey: You know, I don't enjoy seeing you miserable, Dinah. I happen to think that you suffered enough for one lifetime.",
        "Dinah: Have you ever thought about helping me out with that?",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, as a matter of fact I have. But see, I've been kind of busy trying to survive myself. Sorry. We're not done.",
        "Dinah: I don't care what's in that file because what you're going to do is delete it. You're going to get rid of it. I've done my job-- over. Now let me go.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you know, what, I wish it were that simple, but it's not.",
        "Dinah: Oh, really? Why don't you tell me why it is not that simple?",
        "Jeffrey: Because we know each other too well, Dinah. Because we can't be separated. Okay, we can be in one way, but I like you too much, so we have to find a way to co-exist.",
        "Dinah: Co-exist? Why don't you tell me how that is going to be possible when you hold things over my head and you threaten me? I told Mallet about the Beacon fire.",
        "Jeffrey: Did he tell Frank? Did you? I'm glad you got that off your chest, but it's still off the record. If I release information linking you to that fire, you go back to prison.",
        "Dinah: I pretty much think I'm trapped now. Where the hell do you think I am?",
        "Jeffrey: Where you are is in a very unique position. Very few people get to go to hell and come back again. When I pulled you out of that prison, the minute you took my hand, you were bound to me. I am not your enemy. You know that. This is just who we are, and we don't want anyone coming back from the past to haunt us, do we? So we're always going to be looking over our shoulder.",
        "Dinah: Is that how you're going to become mayor, by always looking over your shoulder?",
        "Jeffrey: Dinah...",
        "Dinah: You're going to have your own life and you're going to get to know exactly whom you want to know. Let me tell you something, Jeffrey: I know you better than anyone else. Better than all of the creeps and all of the women you slept with. And you know what you taught me? You taught me something very important: That anything is possible, especially if you want it bad enough. And I want Mallet. So let me tell you something: You better duck and hide because I will rip your head off if you get in my way, okay?",
        "Jeffrey: How much of a problem are you going to be?",
        "Dinah: I don't know if you can afford to find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Dinah, I want to tell you... where's my file?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "R.J.: What are we doing here?",
        "Josh: I thought it might be a nice place to talk.",
        "R.J.: A cemetery?",
        "Josh: Well, it's quiet at least.",
        "R.J.: Because they're dead.",
        "Josh: So you don't want to talk, huh?",
        "R.J.: Not really.",
        "Josh: You don't want to talk to me or you don't want to talk about your mom?",
        "R.J.: Both.",
        "Josh: Well, that's fine. Because I actually brought you here so you can talk to your dad.",
        "R.J.: My dad's dead.",
        "Josh: I know. But, see, after my father died, I used to go to where he was buried, and I would sit with him, you know, on a bench, by a tree and talk to him. Especially when I was confused about some things. See, just because they're not with us anymore doesn't mean they can't still shine their light on this earth.",
        "R.J.: What do you mean, like an angel?",
        "Josh: Kind of, sort of, yeah. But the important thing is he's listening. So talk to him. Okay. Do you mind if I talk to him a little bit?",
        "R.J.: Okay.",
        "Josh: All right. Hey, Richard. I guess your wondering what's going on with your family these days. Am I still R.J.'s Uncle Josh or am I something else?",
        "R.J.: It's confusing.",
        "Josh: I want to promise you something, I will never hurt Cassie. I will never hurt her children. If there's something wrong, something that needs fixing, I will make it my business to fix it and make it right. Just like I did with R.J.'s volcano. Remember that?",
        "R.J.: I remember.",
        "Josh: Why don't you tell him about it.",
        "R.J.: Okay. Hi, dad. I miss you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I did it! I did it. Yay!",
        "Tammy: Hey! Do you need a hand?",
        "Cassie: I was cheering for myself, but feel free to cheer for me, too, if you like.",
        "Tammy: Wow, princess to handy woman.",
        "Cassie: I know. Who would have thunk it, right?",
        "Tammy: I'm glad you're in a good mood.",
        "Cassie: Uh-oh.",
        "Tammy: I didn't say anything.",
        "Cassie: Every parent knows what's coming next. What's going on?",
        "Tammy: Can't I just be glad that you're in a good mood? I mean the last time you and I talked, you and Josh were, you know...",
        "Cassie: Well, we're doing better now. We have some issues to deal with, but we're not running from them. I learned a few life lessons from my-- oh, so wise-- daughter about that. Now, come on, what is going on?",
        "Tammy: Just the usual. Alan's trying to have Lizzie committed so he can steal the baby. So Jonathan, Lizzie and I are skipping town before Alan can crush us all.",
        "Cassie: You're leaving?",
        "Tammy: Today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: First one to throw granddad off. That's ours.",
        "Jonathan: Nice, nice. Alright, I'm going to leave the bartender a note and tell him if he needs anything, he can call Billy. If he can ever find the guy.",
        "Billy: Hey.",
        "Jonathan: Hey.",
        "Billy: I'm here now. Something going on I should know about?",
        "Jonathan: I'm leaving town and I want you to keep quiet.",
        "Billy: As in don't tell your mother about this.",
        "Jonathan: Well, when we get where we're going, I'll call.",
        "Billy: Or, you can tell her now, yourself.",
        "Jonathan: Please don't tell me you're standing behind me.",
        "Reva: Sorry. Perfect timing as usual.",
        "Jonathan: Reva, I don't care what you say, what kind of strings you pull, me, Tammy and Lizzie are leaving town.",
        "Reva: Over my dead body. How do you like that string?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim Zimmer, \"Inside The Light.\" Lately, Reva has been having a lot of fantasies about Joshua Lewis, and he's always in a very light blue, button down shirt, and it makes his eyes go pop. And I'm sure when all is said and done, Reva's going to have a lot of explainin' to do. See Reva, August 30th, Wednesday, \"Inside The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Look, don't turn this into a thing, all right?",
        "Lizzie: You're hair is growing back. It looks nice.",
        "Jonathan: It kind of looks like a porcupine, but, hey, it's just hair. It's just hair.",
        "Reva: You know what, I need you to explain yourself to me. And you have to make it fast, because I may be on borrowed time, but I need to stay alive long enough to knock some sense into you. Please tell me you're not running away.",
        "Jonathan: Well, I wouldn't call it running away. I'd call it doing what's best for my kid, and this is what you told me.",
        "Reva: You really think this is what's best, what you want?",
        "Jonathan: Alan is pushing my hand. Either we leave town, or Lizzie goes into the nut house. And my child is not going to be born in a some asylum.",
        "Lizzie: It may be possible for him send me away since I did tried to shoot him.",
        "Billy: You tried to shoot Alan Spaulding? Damn, I like you.",
        "Reva: Lizzie, where earth did you get the gun?",
        "Jonathan: Where do you think she got the gun? Alan practically shoved it in her hands and helped her pull the trigger. It was blanks of course. I mean, I don't know why we're talking about this. Because as soon as the judge finds out that she's connected to me, it's over.",
        "Reva: Not necessarily.",
        "Billy: Why don't we go out give them a little privacy, okay?",
        "Reva: Please don't do this.",
        "Jonathan: I'm out of options. Look, if this is about you being sick...",
        "Reva: Oh, no, don't drag me into this. This is about you losing everything you've been trying to save. Look, I left town for all of the right reasons, and I lost the man who I love more than my own life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You'd follow Jonathan anywhere.",
        "Tammy: I would.",
        "Cassie: Even with Lizzie in tow?",
        "Tammy: What choice do I have?",
        "Cassie: You always have options, Tammy. You just have to be willing to hear them.",
        "Tammy: Alan will use all his powers to get this baby, Mom.",
        "Cassie: I know, you have to go.",
        "Tammy: We can't just sit around and be out in the open, I mean--",
        "Cassie: I know.",
        "Tammy: ...We're sitting ducks.",
        "Cassie: You have to go.",
        "Tammy: And staying would be crazy. What, what did you say?",
        "Cassie: I said I know you have to leave. I can't tell you how proud of you I am for standing by this child.",
        "Tammy: It's not just a baby, Mom.",
        "Cassie: I know, it's Jonathan's.",
        "Tammy: I want to share everything with him. If that includes Lizzie Spaulding's baby, okay.",
        "Cassie: You love with your whole heart and soul, Tammy. I like that about you.",
        "Tammy: I'm just living the way I was raised.",

        "R.J.: Did cemeteries scare you when you were a kid?",
        "Josh: Actually, when I was a kid in Oklahoma, we used to play in a cemetery. (Laughs)",
        "R.J.: Really?",
        "Josh: It didn't seem all that weird at the time. I mean, it was a small town, you know, and there was pretty much everyone in town was always there, and you either saw them every day on the sidewalk, or the ones that had passed away, you wouldn't see them, but you would-- well, you'd know where they were.",
        "R.J.: You mean like ghosts?",
        "Josh: No, no, not like ghosts. More like memories. Some good; some bad.",
        "R.J.: Do you have a lot of bad memories?",
        "Josh: Yeah. Mostly about things I should have done, but didn't. How about you?",
        "R.J.: I guess. Mostly, I just get sad. I don't want to talk to my mom about it. So there's no one else.",
        "Josh: R.J., I want you to understand something, all right? In your heart, you will always have me.",
        "R.J.: Cool.",
        "Josh: (Laughs) Good. So you coming to New York?",
        "R.J.: I guess.",
        "Josh: Excellent, because we're going to have a great time at the Intrepid. They're doing something really nice and I would like to have you there.",
        "R.J.: Okay. But can we get some Yankees tickets?",
        "Josh: I'll tell you a secret.",
        "R.J.: What?",
        "Josh: I already got Yankees' tickets, Yankees and Tigers.",
        "R.J.: Awesome!",
        "Josh: (Laughs) Ow.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: You would think that my life would add up to more than this. Maybe the weight of our past isn't as heavy as I thought. Did you read it?",
        "Dinah: I have your life committed to my memory. Why would I need to read it?",
        "Jeffrey: You're not going to talk.",
        "Dinah: Well, I don't know what I could gain from that. What I want is a second chance with Mallet.",
        "Jeffrey: All right. So I'll stick with politics and you stick with Mallet. And we'll both start forgetting the past. Fair?",
        "Dinah: I can do that.",
        "Jeffrey: We'll see.",
        "Dinah: Hey.",
        "Mallet: Where is it?",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Mallet: Give me the file, Dinah, or I swear to God, I'll turn you upside down and I'll shake it out of you.",
        "Dinah: Mallet, you are causing a scene here.",
        "Mallet: Does it look like I care? Does it look like I care?!",
        "Dinah: Okay--",
        "Mallet: I want that file back.",
        "Dinah: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Mallet: You know what, I am sick of your lies. You come into my room last night like you're on some kind of a spy mission, you sleep with me, and then when I'm in the shower, you steal from me?",
        "Dinah: Last night I was at your place because I needed you.",
        "Mallet: No, you needed me to fall for your act so you can steal a file for Jeffrey O'Neill.",
        "Dinah: What are you talking about?",
        "Mallet: Did you take the file?",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Mallet: Did you take the file?!",
        "Dinah: What we had last night was real and you know it.",
        "Mallet: Did you take the file?!",
        "Dinah: Yeah.",
        "Mallet: Then I want it back.",
        "Dinah: I don't have it.",
        "Mallet: You don't have it?",
        "Dinah: No.",
        "Mallet: Did you already give it to your master?",
        "Dinah: Master-- what are you talking about?",
        "Mallet: Sit, beg, roll over, play dead. I don't care what you have to do, I want that file back.",
        "Dinah: Mallet, I did this for us, and if you would just trust me for once--",
        "Mallet: Trust you? I think I did, last night, didn't I? Look where it got me. Have you lost your mind? Are you losing your mind?",
        "Dinah: I have changed. You changed me.",
        "Mallet: Congratulations, babe, because look what you changed into, someone who used to sleep with me out of love, and who now sleeps with me so she can rip me off. I want the file.",
        "Dinah: Just listen to me.",
        "Mallet: What are you going to say? What are you going to tell me? Come with me, okay? If you really want me to believe we have something, just tell me something. We can end this right now, just tell me everything you know about Jeffrey O'Neill.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Mom--",
        "Cassie: Honey, I'm not letting you go on the run. It's not much.",
        "Tammy: I can't take it.",
        "Cassie: Think of it as a loan, okay? You can pay me back when you come back to town. Will you call me?",
        "Tammy: Alan can tap your phone and trace cell phone calls.",
        "Cassie: Honey, if you need me for anything, anything at all...",
        "Tammy: I will find a way to contact you.",
        "R.J.: Tammy!",
        "Josh: Hey!",
        "Tammy: R.J., hi Uncle Josh.",
        "Josh: Hi. Everything okay?",
        "Cassie: Fine.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "R.J.: Mom, Uncle Josh took me to see my dad.",
        "Josh: It was kind of a guy thing.",
        "Tammy: Bye, Mom.",
        "Josh: You going somewhere?",
        "Tammy: Just a little trip.",
        "Cassie: Honey, I love you.",
        "Tammy: Bye.",
        "Josh: I'll see you.",
        "R.J.: Tammy looks sad.",
        "Cassie: I know.",
        "R.J.: And so do you?",
        "Cassie: Me, no. I've got two great guys. What could I possibly be sad about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: So now you're sorry that you didn't tell Josh about the cancer?",
        "Reva: No, because if I had had to do it again, I would make the exact same choice.",
        "Jonathan: What?! I don't understand you. All you talk about is family this, and family that, and when it comes time when you actually need your family--",
        "Reva: We're up against two totally different things here. If you run, you're letting Alan push you around and dictate your life. And what kind of life are you going to have on the run? With no job, no plan, no doctor, a pregnant woman that you don't love and another woman that you've loved your whole life. It doesn't make any sense. It's crazy, which, of course, proves Alan's point, by the way.",
        "Jonathan: Well, it's no crazier than you not telling Josh about the cancer.",
        "Reva: Alan Spaulding is not the only person in this town with clout. So what you need to do is do what you do best. If he starts swinging, you need to hit him back and hit him harder. There are people who will rally to your side. And your mama will be right there leading the charge. If we both decide to stay, then who beats us? Nobody beats us, except maybe us.",
        "Jonathan: Uh-huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Okay, you were right. Last night, that was a dream. But this right here, this is us. This is us, wide awake.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, only if you want it to be.",
        "Dinah: You know what your problem is? Your world is black and white, when it is convenient for you.",
        "Mallet: Because that's the way life is. Because you have a choice right now. You can lie to me or you can tell me the truth.",
        "Dinah: Okay. You know what, I'll take a page from your book, black and white. You can't live in my world and I can't live in yours.",
        "Mallet: Would you please stop walking away from me.",
        "Dinah: Would you stop pushing me away?!",
        "Mallet: Well lets split the difference. We'll be in the middle, okay. We met in the middle last night. How about that?",
        "Dinah: Can you really say that? Can you say that you would stop doubting me and going after me just for what you want. I wish I didn't love you so much. That's the problem.",
        "Mallet: Just give me a chance, okay? Just give us a chance. Who cares about the doubts?",
        "Dinah: I do. I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Well, so much for loyalty.",
        "Ditkins: I warned you. You're way too above ground, O'Neill. And running for mayor raises your profile even more. That kind of thing makes people nervous.",
        "Jeffrey: Is that why you tried to throw me under a bus?",
        "Ditkins: You were the one tempting fate.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you know what? You're not my boss anymore. And this is my town.",
        "Ditkins: Is that so?",
        "Jeffrey: You trained me. You know what I can do to you.",
        "Ditkins: On many levels, O'Neill, yes, I do.",
        "Jeffrey: Get out of town, or you'll find out firsthand just how well you taught me. I will dispose of anyone or anything that gets in my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: I promise you that I will stay here and fight Alan Spaulding on one condition: You do the same.",
        "Reva: I am fighting, in case you haven't heard, I'm still alive.",
        "Jonathan: Lucky me.",
        "Reva: You are lucky, because I have something for you. This, um, the whole time I was in the clinic, knowing that you were going to go up against Alan Spaulding over the baby, I was thinking, you need a leg up. And, of course, I know that the only thing you like to read are comic books.",
        "Jonathan: Comic books are literature.",
        "Reva: Yeah, yeah, but this is a complete history of Alan Spaulding. All of his wins and all of his losses. It's decades of work, including his illegal adoption of Phillip, all the battles he did with Roger Thorpe, his bribes, his... judges that he probably owns. Everything I could find without leaving my room.",
        "Jonathan: Wow, how did you get all of this?",
        "Reva: Friends. People owe me. The three of you are in the fight of your lives, but you can win.",
        "Jonathan: Thank you, Mother.",
        "Lizzie: So? What happened with Reva?",
        "Jonathan: I told her to stay and fight, and she told me to do the same thing.",
        "Lizzie: Fight who? That's insane.",
        "Tammy: What's insane?",
        "Lizzie: We're not going.",
        "Tammy: What do you mean?",
        "Jonathan: Look, I don't trust this system, but it has got to work for somebody, why not us?",
        "Lizzie: Because my granddad can buy the system.",
        "Tammy: You want to stay and fight Alan.",
        "Lizzie: No judge is going to hear you over the cha-ching of Spaulding money.",
        "Jonathan: Like I was thinking earlier, money isn't everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Joshua? It's so good to be home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I can't thank you enough for stepping up with R.J. like that. He just really needs a man and a father figure in his life right now.",
        "Josh: Not just right now. Forever, I think.",
        "Cassie: Do you know that everything just seems like it's going to be all right when I'm with you. No matter what we do.",
        "Josh: So what would you like to do?",
        "Cassie: (Laughs) What would you like to do?",
        "Josh: You are really beautiful. (Cell phone rings)",
        "Cassie: (Laughing)",
        "Josh: I'm sorry. It might be about the trip to New York. Let me answer it, and then I promise I'll turn it off.",
        "Cassie: It's okay. I am not going anywhere.",
        "Josh: Okay. (Cell phone rings)",
        "Cassie: What, Reva?",
        "Josh: Yeah. Hello Reva.",
        "Reva: Come home, Joshua.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Cassie: Did she say what she wants?",
        "Josh: No.",
        "Cassie: Reva wants you back.",
        "Josh: It feels like a betrayal. What happened, happened.",
        "Reva: Joshua, wait. Wait! There's something I have to tell you."
