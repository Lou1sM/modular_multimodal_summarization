        "Josh: I'm sorry. That might be about the New York trip. I'll answer it, then I'll turn it off. I promise.",
        "Cassie: It's okay. It's okay. I am not going anywhere. (Cell phone ringing) What? Reva?",
        "Josh: Yeah. Hello Reva.",
        "Reva: Come home, Joshua.",
        "Josh: Where are you?",
        "Reva: I'm here. Come home.",

        "Cassie: How long has she been home?",
        "Josh: She didn't say.",
        "Cassie: Did she say what she wants?",
        "Josh: No.",
        "Cassie: No. Of course she doesn't. Because she doesn't have to, Josh. Because it's obvious. Reva wants you back. God, it's strange how life can change in a moment...",

        "Colonel Briggs: Good morning, ma'am. Colonel Briggs. Is Mr. Lewis at home?",
        "Reva: No, no, he is not.",
        "Colonel Briggs: Are you Mrs. Lewis?",
        "Reva: Yes, yes, I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: I'm going to tell her everything. Everything about how much you mean to me. That Reva is the one that walked away. I want to hear it from her. I want to know why, and that's it. No matter what she says, it's not going to change the way I feel about you.",
        "Cassie: I know. I know that.",
        "Josh: This is just tying up loose ends, nothing more.",
        "Cassie: Uh-huh.",
        "Josh: Putting a period on the past so that you and I can move forward into the future together.",
        "Cassie: Okay, okay, okay. Then go, okay? Just go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I'm sorry. What ceremony are we talking about?",
        "Colonel Briggs: To celebrate the opening of the H.B. Lewis Center in Tulsa.",
        "Reva: It's opening?",
        "Colonel Briggs: Mr. Lewis is being honored for the good work he has done on behalf of veterans.",
        "Reva: Oh, of course, that is today.",
        "Colonel Briggs: In New York City, ma'am. Aboard the Intrepid Museum.",
        "Reva: The aircraft carrier?",
        "Colonel Briggs: No, the decommissioned aircraft carrier. Mr. Lewis's itinerary and all of his travel information is here in the envelope.",
        "Reva: Well, I'll see to it that he gets it. Thank you so much, Colonel, for coming by. I really appreciate it. Thank you. Bye. God, it's strange how life can change in a moment My, God, it's strange how life will change in a moment I can't remember what I was about to say...",
        "Josh: Hello, Reva. Wow. As I was driving over here, I was thinking about all of the things I was going to say to you. It wasn't pretty. But now that I'm standing here with you, the first thing that comes to mind is I'm glad you're all right.",
        "Reva: All right.",
        "Josh: In one piece, Reva. You've been away for a long time, and, um, you could have been dead for all I knew.",
        "Reva: Wow, you know, that's the first thing you want to say to me. That's interesting. Because if I were you, the first thing that I want to say is that I'm sorry for cheating on you with your own sister. It was a low-down, despicable, unforgivable thing to do.",
        "Josh: Hawk told you. Good, well, then, it is out the of the way.",
        "Reva: Well, it should have been you. You should have been the one who told me.",
        "Josh: How could it have been me, when I didn't know where you were?",
        "Reva: Oh, so that makes it okay. My mistake.",
        "Josh: All you had to do was stay in touch.",
        "Reva: And all you had to do with keep your pants zipped! So you're blaming me. So it is my fault that you're boffing my sister?",
        "Josh: Oh, man. That's a whole lot of in indignation from the one who slept with and married my father and my brother.",
        "Reva: Married-- married being the operative word here! That was a long time ago, and now is now.",
        "Josh: Yeah, that's right, Reva. Now is now, and this is me now. This is me, sick and tired after years of putting up with your selfishness and your recklessness, running off to who knows where whenever you feel like it without giving a single thought to my feelings, Reva. Always leaving me behind holding the bag.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, this time you were certainly left holding a whole lot more. Weren't you? Huh? I mean, because believe me if I hadn't seen you and Cassie together with my very own eyes, I never would have believed it in a million years! Yeah, I saw you. I saw the two of you together. At the Greek Festival. I was here. I came back to talk to you. And to tell you something important, something very important. And that's when I was faced with you groping with my sister right there in this very public place.",
        "Josh: Why didn't you say anything?",
        "Reva: Why didn't I say anything? Because, golly, I don't know, I was shocked, hurt. But you know what, now I'm just... now, I'm just plain mad.",
        "Josh: Get in line. I'm mad, too.",
        "Reva: I bet you were with Cassie when I called you just now, weren't you? Oh, gosh, that reminds me, your travel arrangements arrived. Congratulations. Your plane tickets for you and your girlfriend to go to New York. Go. You know, go and enjoy the pomp and circumstances of your celebration. Enjoy them singing your praises and telling you what a decent, honorable man you are. Full of integrity. When you and I both know the truth, don't we?",
        "Josh: I think that's enough, Reva.",
        "Reva: Go. I'm sure Cassie's waiting.",
        "Josh: I said that's enough, Reva. I'm not going anywhere, not until you and I have straighten out some things about us, and, yes, about your sister, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Newscaster: Lewis will be honored aboard the Intrepid Museum today. Retired Admiral Harrison Fuller will preside over the ceremony. Lewis' project is part of a family dream. The H.B. Lewis Center is set to open...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: You want to tell me what a dog I am, Reva? How much I've hurt you, how much I've betrayed you? Trust me, there is nothing that you can say about me that I haven't already said about myself. You think I wanted this? I didn't. I wanted you. But you disappeared. You shut me out over and over again.",
        "Reva: A man has needs, right?",
        "Josh: We stood together on the balcony of the lighthouse, we tore up our divorce papers. We swore to each other, Reva, we swore that this would be a new beginning. That we would face life together, always, 100%. And then... you left. Just up and took off with my brother, no less. You left me behind, Reva. While I'm gearing up for probably the most important thing I've ever done in my life. When I needed your love and your support more than I ever have, where were you?",
        "Reva: I told you that I would be back.",
        "Josh: And I believed you. Oh, man. (Laughs) And so I waited. And I waited and I waited, Reva, through all of the unreturned phone calls and all the evasive answers. I waited for you. I kept the faith. Why? Because... because I couldn't even imagine that you would betray me in the way that you have. That you could possibly be so selfish, Reva. And so damn cruel, and that's the right word for it, too, Reva, the way you treated me these last few months have been cruel.",
        "Reva: So you decided to be cruel back to get even with me?",
        "Josh: I didn't decide a damn thing, Reva. Not at the beginning, nothing. I was hurt and sad and lonely. And I wanted a shoulder to lean on, just a little bit, someone to talk to, someone to be with, someone to share things with, the good and the bad. And Cassie was there. The whole time, she was there. And she cared, too, at a time when you clearly did not care. She was loving and supportive and kind.",
        "Reva: And young and pretty.",
        "Josh: No. This was not about physical attraction. This was about an emotional connection. A connection that I wanted to make with you. That I should have made with you. With my wife. I didn't connect with Cassie because I wanted to hurt you. It's because she is a loving person.",
        "Reva: (Laughs)",
        "Josh: She was there for me, and she gave something to me that you couldn't give me, that you wouldn't give me, Reva. She gave me herself. She wasn't afraid to need me back. Whatever. She made me happy.",
        "Reva: Happy, yeah, I'm sure she did. I'm sure she made you happy more times than I even want to think about.",
        "Josh: You know what, you don't understand! You don't get it, do you?",
        "Reva: In our bed, Joshua!",
        "Josh: If it was about sex, I would have picked up some woman in a bar, Reva. But what Cassie and I have together is much deeper than that. And by the way, excuse me, for the record, we have not slept together! We want... we've come close, but we didn't because... because we knew that it would be such an incredible betrayal to you. Because despite everything you have done, we both still love you very much. What if, what now, what then... I have a plane to catch. (Sighs) This is a very proud day for me. Maybe one of the biggest days of my life, and I had hoped that you would be by my side, Reva. With me on the flight deck. I had hoped that you would have been the first person that I would thank because you had been with me every step of the way. The fact is, you weren't. What happened, happened. There's no going back.",
        "Reva: Joshua, wait. Wait! There's something I have to tell you.",
        "Josh: Good-bye, Reva.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Hi, Josh, it's me. Um, just wanted to check in. I hope it went okay with Reva.",
        "Reva: Things went just great... for you, Cassie. Josh and I really had it out. Maybe if you hurry, you can get your claws into him and really seal the deal before he realizes what a huge mistake he's made.",
        "Cassie: Reva, I'm so sorry.",
        "Reva: Are you?",
        "Cassie: Look, we can't do this here. I think we should go somewhere else.",
        "Reva: Why is that? Are you afraid that someone may find out you stole your sister's husband? Maybe you should have thought about that before you put the moves on him. But, hey, it's all right, right, because you're sorry. So that makes it okay.",
        "Cassie: I am sorry, Reva. But I'm also sorry that you feel the need to blame somebody else. Did you really think you could just take off like that, and everything would be hunky-dory when you came back? Everybody would still be the same, nothing would change, everyone would just automatically forgive you? You deserted Josh. You deserted him at the most important time of his life.",
        "Reva: Did you compare notes? Is that what this is about?",
        "Cassie: Did you stop once to think about his feelings, Reva, once?",
        "Reva: That's all I thought about every day.",
        "Cassie: Okay, so in all that thinking about him that you did, what did you think he would do? I mean, honestly, how did you think he would react to that kind of insult?",
        "Reva: I thought maybe he might keep his vows he made to me.",
        "Cassie: Oh, when you didn't keep your vows to him? You vowed to make him your partner in life. You vowed to share everything with him, good and bad. No? Am I wrong? You're above that? You don't have to play by the same rules the rest of us have?",
        "Reva: Rules? You want to talk about rules, Cassie? How about the big one, thou shalt not covet thy sister's husband.",
        "Cassie: Oh, so Josh and I are supposed to live by the rules, but you don't have to.",
        "Reva: Oh, my God, I know what this is about now. This is about Richard. I take yours away from you, so you have to take mine away from me. Is that what this is?",
        "Cassie: Wow, of course you would think that, yeah. Of course you would think that. Because once again, it is all about you. Your husband needed you, Reva. He needed you. Your husband, who is an amazing man with a beautiful heart, needed you. You want to make this about you? You failed him! You failed him utterly and completely. He never would have done that to you, Reva.",
        "Reva: Maybe I know that, Cassie. Maybe that's exactly why I did what I did.",
        "Cassie: What you did? What you did was abandon him.",
        "Reva: Thankfully for Joshua, you were right there to pick up the pieces, weren't you?",
        "Cassie: Yes. Thankfully, I was.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Reva! So, did you see him?",
        "Reva: Yeah.",
        "Billy: Well, did you talk to him?",
        "Reva: Yeah, I did. Cassie, too. I wish this was the hard stuff.",
        "Billy: That means it was serious between you, right? Hey, I'm sorry. Maybe if you made a stand back when you're healthy...",
        "Reva: If I had, it would have been a huge mistake.",
        "Billy: So what are you saying?",
        "Reva: I just wonder that if I hadn't taken off-- disappeared in their eyes-- if they would have found each other.",
        "Billy: Maybe not.",
        "Reva: Because I had this big plan, how everything was going to work out, and part of it worked out. I mean, Josh got that hospital built. But then there was that other part, the part where I felt like I had to control everything. And what happened was I got results I didn't bargain for.",
        "Billy: What are you going to do about it?",
        "Reva: I don't know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I had to take some time, take a walk and clear my head.",
        "Josh: You don't have to explain.",
        "Cassie: I didn't want it to be like that. I wanted her to have time to deal with all of this and... I guess it got nasty between you two?",
        "Josh: Yes, it did. How about you?",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Josh: I'm sorry I got you pulled into this.",
        "Cassie: You didn't pull me into this.",
        "Josh: Yes, I did.",
        "Cassie: No, you didn't. And I could say the same to you, Josh, but it... what's the point? We are where we are now. I just... I really thought I was going to be prepared for this.",
        "Josh: I thought I was going to be, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: What, you didn't tell him you were sick? That was part of the plan. That was the whole point of confronting him.",
        "Reva: That whole time that we were in New York, I kept seeing them together, you know, having this affair, a tawdry, illicit affair, seeing them in bed together, thinking that they were doing it on purpose to get back at me. I'd see them in bed laughing at me, but that's not how it was. I could lose him to her.",
        "Billy: You're not going to lose Josh to your sister, don't worry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Leave it to me to ask the difficult question: What are we going to do now? I mean, do you want to go talk to her some more?",
        "Josh: No.",
        "Cassie: Are you sure?",
        "Josh: Yes.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Will you tell me what you're feeling?",
        "Josh: (Laughs nervously) I'm feeling like I don't know anything more about why Reva left or where she went than I did a week ago.",
        "Cassie: She didn't give you any explanation either?",
        "Josh: No, ma'am. Um, I don't think it's about Billy, though.",
        "Cassie: You don't think they're a couple?",
        "Josh: No. I don't see how she could possibly been as self-righteous as she was with me if that was the case. Not even Reva has that kind of gall.",
        "Cassie: I don't know about that. She all but called me a slut.",
        "Josh: I'm so sorry.",
        "Cassie: No, it's okay. She wasn't any tougher on me than I was on myself. She is entitled, she comes back here...",
        "Josh: No, she's not. Don't even go there. We have not even... (laughs) Not that I haven't wanted to, of course.",
        "Cassie: Not that we haven't wanted to.",
        "Josh: I think in my next life I want to be a goldfish, swimming around in a tank all day.",
        "Cassie: That's a good idea. Because really, what do goldfish have to worry about? They just have to worry, do I want to swim right or do I want to swim left.",
        "Josh: That would be nice, don't you think?",
        "Cassie: That would be nice.",
        "Josh: I wouldn't mind having you in a tank with me, though.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: The thought of not having Joshua there at the end, I don't think I can bear it. I need him there to hold my hand. Call me selfish, call me whatever you want, but the last thing I see before I close my eyes for good has got to be Josh. It's got to be Joshua. I've got to see his face. I have to see his face. Because if I don't, I don't know if I could bear going through it.",
        "Billy: It's gonna be okay. Okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: The trip to New York. What am I going to do, send Lillian and, I don't know, one of the guys from the site?",
        "Cassie: Are you out of your mind? You're going to do no such thing.",
        "Josh: Cassie, after what happened, this doesn't seem like the right thing to do anymore.",
        "Cassie: This-- this has nothing to do with Reva! This has everything to do with you! And you have worked so incredibly hard for this! If you think I'm going to let you miss out on getting all of the credit that you deserve and enjoying every single second of it, then we may have to rethink this whole relationship, because you clearly don't know me at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I have to go to New York.",
        "Billy: What are you doing? You're not going now.",
        "Reva: I have to.",
        "Billy: Why?",
        "Reva: They're having this big honor for the veterans' project. Josh is being honored. There's a group of veterans, volunteers, that donated a lot of money to the project, and it's a big deal. It's a huge honor for him, and I need to be there to applaud him. And I need to be there to make up for all of the times I wasn't there for him. I mean, this is a big deal. And then, after he has his moment, which he deserves, then I'm going to sit him down and I'm going to tell him everything, and I mean everything. I'm going to tell him how much I love him. I'm going to tell him that I need him. So um... I'll call you when I get back.",

        "R.J.: The ship was the coolest thing ever. I sat in the pilot seat of an F-14 Tomcat.",
        "Cassie: Wow.",
        "Josh: Wow.",
        "R.J.: And then, the Admiral, he took me to see the top secret missile command center of the Growler.",
        "Cassie: What's a Growler?",
        "Admiral: She's our resident submarine. I gave R.J. the full tour. Harrison Fuller. It's a pleasure to meet you in person, Mr. Lewis.",
        "Josh: A pleasure to meet you.",
        "Admiral: Ms. Winslow?",
        "Cassie: Yes.",
        "Admiral: It's so great to meet the voice on the phone. Ms. Winslow was a great help to me in organizing this tonight.",
        "Cassie: No, I'm just along for the ride.",
        "Admiral: No, I think you deserve a citation of you own, young lady.",
        "Cassie: Well, thank you.",
        "Josh: (Laughs)",
        "Cassie: The work we're doing now can't compare to what you've already accomplished.",
        "Josh: Yeah, we've been following the rehabilitation center in San Antonio, Texas.",
        "Admiral: It's the American people's donation to the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund that made that happen.",
        "Cassie: And I understand that there are two houses nearby for the families of the patients and the education center as well.",
        "Josh: In fact, I was hoping you could give me more information on the Fisher House Foundation, maybe after the ceremony.",
        "Admiral: Yes.",
        "Josh: We'll be right along. Thanks.",
        "Cassie: (Laughing)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Excuse me. Um, whoa, I was supposed to meet a man... well, a man by the name of Joshua Lewis is being honored here today, and they told me he might be in the ward room.",
        "Officer: That's right here, ma'am. (Knocking on the door)",
        "Reva: Well, I must have missed him. I'll just go back up then.",
        "Officer: Ma'am, you all right?",
        "Reva: I'm fine, really, I am. No, it's just fatigue. It has been a very stressful day.",
        "Officer: Are you sure, ma'am?",
        "Reva: I'm sure. Do you mind if I turn this up? That is Joshua.",
        "Admiral: Without further ado, let's hear it for the man of the hour, Joshua Lewis! (Applause)",
        "Josh: Thank you very much. Admiral Fuller, I appreciate it very much. Thank you, thank you. Wow, um, a few months ago, I was going through my father's desk, an old desk, and I found a set of blueprints there, plans for a hospital that would proudly serve the men and women of this country of our armed forces who have so proudly served us. I decided to build it, to up hold my father's dreams. A lot of people said I couldn't do it, it wouldn't happen, I don't know, because I wouldn't be able to raise the money or whatever. But when you know deep in your heart that something is right, you do it. Even if it is hard, even if it costs you something you care about very much. I did make sacrifices to make this thing happen, but those sacrifices were nothing. They were nothing compared to the sacrifices of our men and women on the battlefield every day. And now you all have made a sacrifice, too. You see, um, whenever I doubted my ability to complete this project, I asked myself this question: Who am I doing this for? And the answer to that question is what kept me going. So I thank you from the bottom of my heart for this honor. Thank you very much. (Applause)",
        "Reva: I have to get up there. I have to see him.",
        "Officer: Okay, let's go.",
        "Reva: Thanks.",
        "Officer: Okay. (Applause) (applause)",

        "Reva: Hi.",
        "R.J.: What are you doing here?",
        "Reva: You know, I wanted to be here to cheer on your Uncle Josh, you know. You think I would miss this special day?",
        "R.J.: Did you see his speech?",
        "Reva: I saw the tail end, yeah. You were so good. You were really so good, Bud.",
        "Josh: We, uh... we didn't know that...",
        "Reva: Yeah, I know. It was a spur of the moment thing. Call me Ms. Spontaneous, but you all have a party to get to and I don't want to keep you. All I wanted to say is that, um... well, congratulations.",
        "Josh: That's it?",
        "Reva: Yeah, yeah, you guys enjoy. Y'all deserve it.",
