        "Michelle: Here?",
        "Robbie: Up.",
        "Michelle: Here.",
        "Robbie: Down.",
        "Michelle: Here? You're being silly with me, aren't you? Yeah, you are. How about right here? Perfect. Come here. We're having fun, aren't we? Are you having fun? Yeah? Good. You're a big guy. You know, I used to come here with my dad when I was a kid, and we used to fish on the docks, and we watched the sailboats going around. It was pretty cool. We had a good time.",
        "Tony: Hey, you do realize what just happened, don't you? Hm? You had a memory.",
        "Reva: What are we doing here? Why didn't you come home?",
        "Josh: I thought this would be a better place.",
        "Reva: Better for what?",
        "Josh: I have a surprise for you, a gift.",
        "Reva: What more could i possibly want. I have you. Marah and shayne are happy. Sandy, I think, is finally acclimating to family life.",
        "Josh: Oh, right. Did the two of you make it to the bank to transfer his trust funds?",
        "Reva: No. Time just kind of got away from us today.",
        "Josh: Oh. Okay. I just figured he would be chomping at the bit to start a shopping spree or something like that.",
        "Reva: Me too. But he seems to be fighting it. You know, he's coming into a lot of money, and I don't know why he doesn't want it.",
        "Sandy: Hi, this is josh lewis. I'm sorry to bother you at home. I just wanted top clear up that trust fund issue. Yes, I realize the young man living with us isn't my wife's real son, but that's a private matter and we're dealing with it as a family. No, no. Don't contact the authorities. Nobody needs to know.",
        "Tammy: Know what?",
        "Sandy: Thank you for your assistance. Tammy, I thought you were going to cedars with remy.",
        "Tammy: Well, I came back because I forgot something. I let myself in. What are you trying to hide?",
        "Jeffrey: All right, so don't forget, you impersonated this woman, so be obstinate, be flip. And whatever you do, don't show any signs of remorse whatsoever.",
        "Agent: You know me. Piece of cake.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, I appreciate this, paulsen. You know, this is the only way that we can put mrs. Winslow's mind at ease and keep her out of my investigation, if you know what I mean.",
        "Agent: I told you on the phone: It's not a problem. Anything for my pal jeffrey. Of course, you will pay me back.",
        "Jeffrey: Just like I always do. Okay, you can come in now.",
        "Cassie: So is your life so pathetic that you had to steal mine?",
        "Edmund: Jeffrey o'neill impersonated richard.",
        "Dinah: I'm afraid so.",
        "Edmund: Who told you this?",
        "Dinah: Jeffrey himself. And apparently your brother was involved.",
        "Edmund: Why?",
        "Dinah: It had to do with the drug runners in st. Cristobal. Richard wanted to put a stop to it, and he needed help from the us government.",
        "Edmund: Jeffrey o'neill, a federal agent, looked exactly like richard, so no one would ever know. Is that it?",
        "Dinah: That was the idea. He could infiltrate the organization and protect the royal family at the same time.",
        "Edmund: Who else knew about this besides richard?",
        "Dinah: I don't have many details.",
        "Edmund: How often did it happen?",
        "Dinah: I don't know, but i know that it happened.",
        "Edmund: So jeffrey o'neill was with cassie as richard.",
        "Dinah: Well, pictures don't lie. And if you look at that smile, I'd say that jeffrey liked living richard's life a little too much.",
        "Edmund: But my brother was a stickler for detail. He must have spent hours with the man-- ages-- going over all the details of our lives. When?",
        "Dinah: Jeffrey is a brilliant undercover agent. I mean, he knows his subjects as well as they know themselves. He knows their mannerisms, their tastes, as well as how they act around the people in their lives.",
        "Edmund: But why would he have done it? Why would he have let that man get so close to cassie? Well, to protect her. But that doesn't make any sense.",
        "Dinah: Well, jeffrey's good-- I mean, especially with the ladies. He figures out exactly what she needs almost before she knows it. Edmund, look, I don't know what I'm sorrier about: That I'm telling you this now, or that i didn't tell you it earlier.",
        "Edmund: There were times when he was so distant. Richard was so preoccupied. I just always thought it was a man under the pressure of trying to run a country. But maybe it was just o'neill keeping me at arms' length.",
        "Dinah: Just don't do this to yourself.",
        "Jeffrey: No. I want to know more. I want to know more. I want to know where. I want to know when. I want to know what.",
        "Dinah: Okay, I wish I could tell you more. But, you know, jeffrey kept me in the dark purposely. All I know is that his time in san cristobal, it changed him, playing richard. It was more than a job. It became an obsession.",
        "Jeffrey: And so did cassie.",
        "Cassie: I just want to know why-- not for the money, because you paid off the cards.",
        "Agent: I did it because i could.",
        "Cassie: So that's your answer.",
        "Agent: You were a continent away. I had nothing to lose.",
        "Cassie: So you feel no remorse at all?",
        "Agent: Why should I? I had a blast.",
        "Cassie: You were at the farm, in my home, where my children live.",
        "Dinah: It was my house, too, where I should have lived with my children. But you took those things away from me. You have everything, and I have nothing because of you.",
        "Cassie: You're demented. But then I've known that for years.",
        "Dinah: Why couldn't my aim have been better? I should have killed you that day?",
        "Jeffrey: Stop it! All right, stop it! Stop it now.",
        "Sandy: Okay, nosey knowserson, I was talking to mr. Duncan at the bank.",
        "Tammy: At this time of night?",
        "Sandy: I called him at home to stop my inheritance.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, but richard put that money away for your future. He wanted you to have it.",
        "Sandy: And I don't want it. Don't ask me why, I just don'T.",
        "Tammy: Because you never knew him?",
        "Sandy: Maybe. I don't know. I just don't feel comfortable taking it.",
        "Tammy: Sandy, it's yours. Richard made me and my brothers his family. He adopted us, okay? He made us his kids. But you are his flesh and blood. He would have raised you if he could. I know he never stopped thinking about you.",
        "Sandy: That's nice, but i didn't come here for the money.",
        "Tammy: No one's saying that you did. But you don't have to throw it away.",
        "Sandy: Tammy, it's done.",
        "Tammy: Sandy, listen. Wait a second. Okay. So you don't want the money. Fine. You could at least give it to charity.",
        "Sandy: That is a good idea. Can we change the subject now?",
        "Tammy: Yeah. Yeah, we can change the subject. I brought another present that i want to give you. Joey had me all flustered earlier, and I left it in the car.",
        "Sandy: It never ends. Oh. Thank you.",
        "Tammy: You make aunt reva so happy. You're a big part of this family now, and I just wanted you to remember who you really are: Jonathan.",
        "Tony: Michelle, this is great. I mean, you remember anything else? Huh?",
        "Michelle: Here's your truck. No. And I don't remember this place either, or my dad.",
        "Tony: Okay, then... then how...",
        "Michelle: Rick. Rick told me.",
        "Tony: Oh. Okay.",
        "Michelle: It seemed like a nice story, and I thought, you know, it would be nice for robbie to have memories like that.",
        "Tony: He will. I mean, it looks like he's having fun, right? Doesn't he?",
        "Michelle: I hope so, tony. I think I'm doing a good job. I don't know though. I'm not... you know, this whole mom thing is still kind of weird for me.",
        "Tony: Well, listen, you couldn't tell that by looking at you. You're doing great with him. You are.",
        "Michelle: Thanks.",
        "Tony: No, you are.",
        "Michelle: Thanks. I just want things to be normal for him now.",
        "Tony: I don't think you have anything to worry about. Like I said, I mean, it looks like he's having a blast. He looks like he's having fun. What's up, buddy?",
        "Michelle: I'm okay with this whole memory loss thing. I'm all right with it most of the time.",
        "Tony: Okay, so then why aren't you okay with this?",
        "Michelle: Well, I'd like to remember the birth of my son, you know-- I mean, not the painful part, but I wouldn't mind remembering what it was like holding him in my arms, you know. I think that would be nice to know what that was like.",
        "Tony: Maybe you will someday. Right?",
        "Michelle: Yeah. Maybe. Maybe one day it will all come back flooding to me, right? I don't know, tony. Sometimes I'm having fun, and i have no care in the world. I kind of don't want it to come back. Then I think that that's the chicken way out, running away from my past.",
        "Tony: Listen, listen. I want to ask you something. I want to ask you something, all right? Do you want to remember?",
        "Michelle: I don't know. I don't know. I guess I have this fear that if it comes back, I'm going to feel guilty or sad.",
        "Tony: Well, you don't have to. You better not forget about me. Right?",
        "Michelle: Oh, forget you?",
        "Tony: Yeah, well, you know, you could.",
        "Michelle: I don't think so-- the guy who saved my life, the guy who helps me feel safe and free. No. I don't think so. Juice, juice, juice.",
        "Tony: Your picture is actually a little crooked over here. Let's see. All right, here we go.",
        "Michelle: Does it need...",
        "Tony: Well... (laughs) you did a good job hanging it. Here. Come on in. All right, you nail. You nail, and I'll put it up there. That's good, right? Here we go. What do you think?",
        "Michelle: Good. (Knock on the door)",
        "Tony: Voila.",
        "Michelle: Oh. Hey, guys. You're early, aren't you?",
        "Rick: We're actually on time.",
        "Mel: Yeah, we have to hurry up before my parents bring leah back.",
        "Michelle: Oh. All right. Oh, robbie, we've got to get your stuff together. You're going to go with your aunt mel and uncle rick. Come on.",
        "Tony: See you, buddy. Excuse me. All right, look, rick, I need to ask you something, and please just be honest with me. The chances, all right, the chances of michelle getting her memory back. What are they?",
        "Rick: There's no way to know.",
        "Tony: Okay, but over time, the more and more time passes, does it get worse?",
        "Rick: Does michelle getting her memory back scare you, tony?",
        "Tony: (Laughs) this is crazy. This is crazy. You're nuts.",
        "Rick: No, it isn'T.",
        "Tony: Yeah.",
        "Rick: Not if you want her for yourself.",
        "Tammy: You know, I wonder, is there a reason that you never go by your real name?",
        "Sandy: Oh, my nickname just kind of stuck. It works, you know.",
        "Tammy: Well, now you can take your laptop with you wherever you go.",
        "Sandy: And travel in style.",
        "Tammy: You know, you really are an important part of this family. It's like you filled an empty space when no one was looking. (Phones ringing)",
        "Sandy: Oh. Oh. Hello? Sorry, you have the wrong number.",
        "Tammy: Kind of jumpy tonight, aren't you?",
        "Sandy: No, no. I'M... what was it that you were talking about, tammy?",
        "Tammy: I was just saying how lucky we are to have you. You're a good guy, sandy. Happy birthday.",
        "Sandy: Maybe I'm not the guy you think I am.",
        "Josh: So how's buzz?",
        "Reva: Last I heard, he was resting peacefully.",
        "Josh: Good. Glad to hear it. I will try to visit him tomorrow.",
        "Reva: So where's the gift?",
        "Josh: You said you didn't want it.",
        "Reva: Well, I changed my mind.",
        "Josh: Tough. Okay. All right, all right, all right. Here you go. It's a two- parter.",
        "Reva: Ooh. Plane tickets?",
        "Josh: Yes.",
        "Reva: To tulsa?",
        "Josh: I figured it was about time for us to visit our favorite place on the planet.",
        "Reva: Oh, cross creek.",
        "Josh: Yes.",
        "Reva: Here we come. Joshua, thank you.",
        "Josh: I was thinking about something we could do once we get there.",
        "Reva: Is that the second part of my gift?",
        "Josh: Not that, something else. Just an idea that I have.",
        "Reva: Okay, what is it?",
        "Josh: Well, you know the stone bridge.",
        "Reva: Where we always paint the kids' names.",
        "Josh: Right. What would you think about adding another name? Jonathan-- or sandy.",
        "Reva: I would think that you were the greatest man on the face of this earth.",
        "Josh: I am. It's true.",
        "Reva: You welcomed him into your life, into our lives. Thank you.",
        "Josh: Reva, I wouldn't have it any other way. Besides, you know, sandy, he's a good kid.",
        "Reva: Yes, he is. And I think we're finally figuring each other out.",
        "Josh: Good. He's working for you, right? That's a good way to bond.",
        "Reva: Yeah. Yeah, he fought it in the beginning. But I think he's going to like it.",
        "Josh: Uh-uh.",
        "Reva: What?",
        "Josh: The second part of your gift has arrived.",
        "Reva: What?",
        "Cassie: Thanks for nothing, jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: Nothing? What are you talking about? I gave you exactly what you wanted.",
        "Cassie: What I wanted was a chance to confront the woman who tried to steal my life. That's what I wanted.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that's what you got.",
        "Cassie: And you said you'd give me ten minutes, and you didn't even give me five. I didn't get one straight answer from her, and then you freaked out and you sent her away.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, come on. I didn't freak out.",
        "Cassie: Yes, you did. What do you call jumping up, going stop, stop, stop for no apparent reason?",
        "Jeffrey: You're lucky you talked to her at all. I broke the rules for you, you know.",
        "Cassie: What do you care?",
        "Jeffrey: You're obsessed with this, aren't you?",
        "Cassie: And you wouldn't be?",
        "Jeffrey: It's not good for you, cassie. It's not good for you.",
        "Cassie: I just wanted a chance to put some closure on this, jeffrey, and you took that away from me.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, come on, don't get all dramatic. She wasn't going to tell you anything anyway.",
        "Cassie: How do you know?",
        "Jeffrey: Trust me, I know.",
        "Cassie: Right. You know. Because you know everything, don't you? I'm sorry, but that woman studied everything about me-- my entire life, okay? And she didn't just stop with my buying habits. She knew where I lived, and she knew the names of my children, jeffrey. And you have no idea what it feels like to be violated like that, and you obviously don't care.",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie, just try to let it go. Okay, just try to let it go.",
        "Cassie: You're not telling me something.",
        "Jeffrey: There's nothing to tell.",
        "Cassie: Oh, yes, there is, or you wouldn't be getting so upset.",
        "Jeffrey: There's no pleasing you, is there?",
        "Cassie: I want to know everything, jeffrey, and I want to know everything now. So start talking.",
        "Edmund: So jeffrey spent time as richard. He became richard. He saw cassie? He met cassie? He spent time with cassie? What?",
        "Dinah: I don't know, edmund.",
        "Edmund: There has to be something. You said he came back from san cristobal a changed man. Why? He played richard, ruler of a country. I know what that can do to a person. It's the respect, power, positions.",
        "Dinah: And he came back to springfield. He followed the drugs.",
        "Edmund: Right. Or did he follow cassie? Come on, he moves... he moves to springfield. He checks into her hotel.",
        "Dinah: Edmund, I know that this is hurting you, and I don't want that. Jeffrey...",
        "Edmund: What did he tell you? What did he tell you about cassie?",
        "Dinah: Nothing. He always said nothing. I saw it differently though.",
        "Edmund: Did jeffrey sleep with cassie?",
        "Dinah: Didn't you just say it yourself, that he confessed for having feelings for her? You know what kind of man he is.",
        "Edmund: I'll kill him!",
        "Dinah: Edmund. Edmund, stop it. You're scaring me.",
        "Edmund: Wait. What the hell am I doing? Why am I doing this? Why am I letting you do this to me?",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Edmund: It doesn't add up. Real reason says it doesn't add up. Why should I believe you? You haven't shown me a shred of evidence.",
        "Dinah: I have no reason to lie.",
        "Edmund: How could you possibly know any of this unless you... oh, my god.",
        "Reva: Coming up on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Cassie: What do you mean, we want to keep the room?",
        "Jeffrey: All flights cancelled.",
        "Edmund: I realized I've been the stupidest man on the face of the planet, but just how long did you think you could play with me?",
        "Dinah: I don't need to listen to this.",
        "Edmund: Yes, you do.",
        "Rick: Yeah, tony, it's pretty obvious you've got feelings for my sister.",
        "Tony: You know, rick, you're just like danny. You feel like you've lost michelle, and you want blame me. Everybody wants to blame tony.",
        "Rick: And why do you think that is? Think about it.",
        "Tony: You know what? You're worried about her. You miss her. I get that, all right? But haven't you seen her, rick? Man, she's happy now. She's free now.",
        "Rick: There's no way for me to know that. She spends all her time here with you.",
        "Tony: Always. Everybody wants to make it about me, don't they? Huh? Why don't you stop doing that and think about michelle maybe for two seconds, man. You know, when she was with danny, yeah, she was stressed out all the time. But you know what? She's out of her shell now, man. She's free, she's having a good time, and she's happy. Let her be.",
        "Rick: You set all of this up, all of it. You got her to move out, move in this place, and start a business.",
        "Tony: I said...",
        "Rick: And I'm sure this is a mob business, too.",
        "Tony: But you're serious, right?",
        "Rick: Yes, I'm serious. All the businesses have been mob businesses.",
        "Michelle: Hey, you're dead wrong.",
        "Tony: (Laughs)",
        "Rick: Oh, I am?",
        "Michelle: I didn't even need to hear much of this conversation to know this isn't about tony. This is about you and me. And you don't like me being so independent.",
        "Mel: Michelle, I think rick... rick just wants you to be happy.",
        "Michelle: Look, we've been through this already, mel. And this is rick doesn't like my life choices, right?",
        "Rick: That's because all your choices have nearly gotten you killed, michelle, every single one of them. Now, look, all I want is for you to be healthy and happy. That's it.",
        "Michelle: Then let me be happy.",
        "Rick: Easier said than done, because I've seen it all before with danny, and it never ends well.",
        "Michelle: Bye, robbie.",
        "Tony: See you, buddy.",
        "Tammy: What are you? Some kind of ax murderer?",
        "Sandy: No, tammy. It's just that you're making me out to be this perfect addition to the lewis family, and I'm not.",
        "Tammy: I was just saying that we're glad to have you around. No biggie.",
        "Sandy: It is a biggie for me. What if I screw it all up?",
        "Tammy: How?",
        "Sandy: Believe you me, i could ruin everything.",
        "Tammy: Okay, now who's being dramatic, huh?",
        "Sandy: You have no idea.",
        "Tammy: Sandy, it's not going to happen, not unless you get possessed by the devil and start doing evil deeds behind reva's back or something.",
        "Sandy: Okay, now that sounds like a soap opera-- something joey's mom would listen to.",
        "Tammy: Please don't say his name.",
        "Sandy: I was afraid things weren't going so hot for you guys tonight.",
        "Tammy: Oh, you could tell?",
        "Sandy: You want to tell me about it?",
        "Tammy: No. I want to have some fun.",
        "Sandy: Well, giddy up. Me, too. Don't you have to be home, though?",
        "Tammy: My mom's out of town. So you want to go party?",
        "Sandy: Where to?",
        "Tammy: Anywhere that we won't see joey.",
        "Sandy: That bad, huh?",
        "Tammy: Worse. You know he was only hanging with me to keep me safe?",
        "Sandy: From what?",
        "Tammy: That whole thing with my mom and the identity thief. You know about this, right? That nut job who was living her life pretending to be my mom. Sick, right?",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie, there's nothing more to know about the case.",
        "Cassie: So you say. But I would like to reclaim my life, if you don't mind.",
        "Jeffrey: Please, be my guest.",
        "Cassie: Then tell me the rest, jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: You want me to make something up? I'll make something up if you don't shut up.",
        "Cassie: Don't tell me to shut up.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, okay. How's this? Please be quiet. Put a sock in it. How does that work for you?",
        "Cassie: I just want a chance to put this behind me. I thought you'd understand that.",
        "Jeffrey: I do understand that. What you don't understand is that we just did.",
        "Cassie: Who are you calling?",
        "Jeffrey: I'm calling the front desk. Get us a taxi to the airport. Yes, hello, this is jeffrey o'neill. My friend and I would like a taxi to the airport, please. Yeah, we're checking out. What? Oh, you've got to be kidding me. No, no, this is the only room... no, we want the room. We want to keep the room. Yes. Thank you.",
        "Cassie: What do you mean, we want to keep the room?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. There's an electrical storm outside, lightning. All planes grounded, all flights cancelled.",
        "Edmund: No. No, no, no, no. You're not going anywhere.",
        "Dinah: You can't keep me here, edmund.",
        "Edmund: Watch me.",
        "Dinah: I have nothing else to tell you.",
        "Edmund: Really? How about the truth?",
        "Dinah: I've told you the truth.",
        "Edmund: Who are you?",
        "Dinah: I told you.",
        "Edmund: Oh, I know what you told me, but why don't you try again?",
        "Dinah: I want to leave. I'll start screaming if you don't get out of my way.",
        "Edmund: Well, scream away, duckie, because I'm certain the police would just love to sort all of this out for us.",
        "Dinah: I'm sorry. I'm forgetting how upset you must be, and I need to be more understanding.",
        "Edmund: The prince needs a princess, doesn't he?",
        "Dinah: Edmund, you don't know what you're saying.",
        "Edmund: Oh, please. I realize I've been the stupidest man on the face of the planet, but just how long did you think you could play with me?",
        "Dinah: I don't need to listen to this.",
        "Edmund: Yes, you do, because I have spent weeks soaking up everything you had to say to me, and you made sure of that.",
        "Dinah: I hated seeing what jeffrey was doing to you. Oh!",
        "Edmund: You see, that's not it either, because you're more than just a flame for old jeffrey boy.",
        "Dinah: No.",
        "Edmund: You were a woman who bought a red cloak.",
        "Dinah: Edmund, no.",
        "Edmund: And traipsed around europe pretending to be cassie, using her name, waiting for your prince to come back, and when he never did, you went looking for him.",
        "Dinah: No.",
        "Edmund: Yes. You see, because you are cassie's imposter.",
        "Josh: Why are you here? I mean, reva's inside waiting for her surprise, and that's you. So what's wrong?",
        "Hawk: Well, funny you should mention that.",
        "Josh: Well, did you do something?",
        "Hawk: You know how I like to gab.",
        "Josh: Yes.",
        "Hawk: I wander on and on about my wildcat days...",
        "Josh: Okay, can this wait?",
        "Hawk: ...My kids, my...",
        "Josh: Can we talk about this later, because reva'S...",
        "Hawk: Will you stop? Don't stop me, boy.",
        "Josh: Okay. Okay.",
        "Hawk: You are not going to want sister to hear this.",
        "Josh: Hear what?",
        "Hawk: It's about cross creek.",
        "Josh: Okay. Actually, I guess I should thank you. Otis tells me you're doing a great job keeping an eye on the place and all that.",
        "Hawk: I'm loving it.",
        "Josh: Good.",
        "Hawk: Except that one day, a couple of weeks ago, this fella comes snooping around asking all sorts of questions.",
        "Josh: What questions?",
        "Hawk: How big it is, who owns the spread it butts up against, how long the family's had it? He says he's writing a book about the area. He wants me as a character. Says I got local color.",
        "Josh: You didn't give him any money or anything, did you?",
        "Hawk: No, no, no. No. No, no, no. But I signed something.",
        "Josh: You signed...",
        "Hawk: So I could be in the book.",
        "Josh: What? A release form?",
        "Hawk: Well, that's what i thought. But then... then I saw this feller get into a car with somebody we both know. One phillip spaulding.",
        "Josh: Phillip spaulding.",
        "Hawk: What does it mean, son?",
        "Josh: I haven't the faintest idea. But I don't think we should tell reva about this until we...",
        "Reva: Josh? Pop?",
        "Hawk: (Laughs)",
        "Reva: What are you doing? Give me a hug, you old coot!",
        "Hawk: Good morning, birdie. It is so good to see you. How have you been, huh?",
        "Reva: I've been good. How are you?",
        "Hawk: No complaints here.",
        "Reva: How's cross creek?",
        "Hawk: Still there.",
        "Reva: (Laughs)",
        "Hawk: I came to see my new grandson on his birthday. Where is he?",
        "Reva: (Laughs)",
        "Cassie: Edmund, it's me. There's a bad storm, and it looks like my flight's cancelled, so I'm going to have to spend the night. I will call you back later. I miss you. I hate lying to him.",
        "Jeffrey: Didn't sound like you lied to me.",
        "Cassie: He thinks I'm at a hotel convention.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, do you think he can handle the truth?",
        "Cassie: You and I spending the night alone here in a hotel room. What do you think?",
        "Jeffrey: I think you did the right thing.",
        "Cassie: I shouldn't have lied to him from the beginning. I should have told him where i was going.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, you were afraid that eddie boy might go ballistic yet again-- a valid concern.",
        "Cassie: You don't have a problem with all this lying, do you? Lying to people, telling lies...",
        "Jeffrey: I'll pretend i didn't hear that.",
        "Cassie: What are you doing?",
        "Jeffrey: You can take the bed.",
        "Cassie: Oh, so you can blame me for your stiff neck in the morning? I don't think so.",
        "Jeffrey: You want this?",
        "Cassie: We both can sleep in the bed, jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: Thanks. This will be fine.",
        "Cassie: Suit yourself.",
        "Jeffrey: You think you could spare one of your ten pillows? Thank you. Sorry. Forgot.",
        "Cassie: Excuse me?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. Keep the light on just in case you have to get up in the middle of the night, because you're in a strange place.",
        "Cassie: How did you know that?",
        "Jeffrey: I know your type.",
        "Cassie: My type.",
        "Jeffrey: Just go to sleep, would you?",
        "Dinah: Let me go.",
        "Dinah: Let me go.",
        "Edmund: Tell me what I want to know.",
        "Dinah: Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Tell me what I want to know.",
        "Dinah: Fine. I posed as princess cassie.",
        "Edmund: Thank you. Now, give me the details.",
        "Dinah: Jeffrey forced me to do it.",
        "Edmund: Convenient excuse.",
        "Dinah: It's true. He had something on me.",
        "Edmund: What?",
        "Dinah: It doesn't matter. What matters is that jeffrey dreamt up this whole thing. I did as I was told.",
        "Edmund: Well, isn't that just virtue of innocence?",
        "Dinah: Not exactly, because i enjoyed it. I played it on my own for a while. Nobody got hurt.",
        "Edmund: Except cassie.",
        "Dinah: I stopped once i realized cassie knew about me. But jeffrey is the one who has kept this alive. That's why I came to you.",
        "Edmund: You're lying again.",
        "Dinah: I'm not.",
        "Edmund: No, you see, because your story keeps changing. And I wonder why that is. Maybe it's just trying to cover everything you've done.",
        "Dinah: I worked for the government.",
        "Edmund: No, not during your latest cassie incarnation. All of your stunts in springfield-- stealing the cloak from the farm, pushing the planter off at the beacon. Now, I wonder what your former employer would think of all that.",
        "Dinah: I didn't do any of that.",
        "Edmund: Tell it to someone who actually believes you.",
        "Dinah: You're making a huge mistake. Jeffrey is the one who's roping cassie in, playing her protector.",
        "Edmund: No, no. You are both twisted up in all of this. I don't want cassie...",
        "Dinah: That's fine. But you might want to tell her the woman that she's looking for is sleeping in her boyfriend's bed.",
        "Reva: Joshua, thank you. This is so much better than those old tickets.",
        "Josh: You are so welcome, darling.",
        "Hawk: So, where's jonathan?",
        "Reva: He's at home. And his name is sandy.",
        "Hawk: Sandy? That's a boy's name?",
        "Reva: It's a nickname, pop, because he likes the beach so much.",
        "Hawk: Oh. Well, let's get on over there. I've got to pass along some legendary shayne history.",
        "Reva: No, you're not going to scare him off, are you?",
        "Hawk: Me?",
        "Reva: Yeah.",
        "Hawk: Oh.",
        "Reva: Oh, joshua, you know what we should do? We should bring sandy to cross creek with us. You know, he'd love that so much, and it would give pops some extra time to spend with him.",
        "Hawk: Well, I'm here, sister.",
        "Reva: Well, I know, but for how long?",
        "Hawk: Long enough to get to know the boy.",
        "Reva: All right.",
        "Hawk: Now, does he have the shayne wild streak? (Laughter) the gift of gab, huh?",
        "Reva: Well, yeah.",
        "Hawk: Yeah.",
        "Reva: Kind of, but different. Actually I'm just getting to know him myself.",
        "Sandy: So your mom must be really relieved now that they caught that person who was...",
        "Tammy: Stealing her life? Yeah, we're all pretty relieved. It's creepy knowing that she was out there.",
        "Sandy: But she didn't mean to hurt anybody, right?",
        "Tammy: Well, who knows? I mean, she was nuts. But anyway, it's over. So are you ready to get out of here?",
        "Sandy: Yeah, let's make like a banana and peel out of here as soon as I leave a note for reva.",
        "Tammy: Okay, I'll meet you in the car.",
        "Sandy: Hi. Do you speak english? Good. I've called here before. I work for a detective agency in the states called harley's angels. No, that's the movie. Harley. Yes, here in springfield. Yes. So I'm looking for information for a client of mine who's son has been missing for some time. Age 18 or 19. Not quite sure. They've been out of touch for a while. I'm just trying to find information about possible accident reports. Any john does?",
        "Michelle: Oh, this is my new favorite song. Come on, dance with me.",
        "Tony: I can't dance. But no, I don't really want to. You know I don't like to dance.",
        "Michelle: Oh, just do it anyway. Come on.",
        "Tony: Come on, you're killing me. Are you serious?",
        "Michelle: Mm-hmm.",
        "Tony: Mm. I can'T. Sorry.",
        "Michelle: We've got to come up with a way to celebrate our partnership, you know.",
        "Tony: Yeah?",
        "Michelle: Mm-hmm.",
        "Tony: Any ideas, except tempting me? (Knock at the door)",
        "Delivery man: Michelle santos?",
        "Michelle: Yeah, that's me. Whoa. Thanks. You shouldn't have.",
        "Tony: Not me. I wish I could say they were, but not me.",
        "Michelle: They're from danny.",
        "Tony: That's great. Here. Let's get back to work, huh?",
        "Cassie: I used to do it, too.",
        "Jeffrey: What?",
        "Cassie: Pretend to be someone else when I was kid growing up in foster homes.",
        "Jeffrey: Really?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, when things would get tough, or when I felt alone.",
        "Jeffrey: So who did you pretend to be?",
        "Cassie: A princess.",
        "Jeffrey: And then you grew up and became one.",
        "Cassie: Pretty ironic, huh? What about you? You ever pretend to be somebody else?",
        "Jeffrey: Once.",
        "Cassie: Oh, like an undercover thing, right? So did you like it?",
        "Jeffrey: I liked it very much.",
        "Cassie: It's so good to get out of your own skin for a while.",
        "Jeffrey: Maybe. But now I know better. Now I'm right where I want to be.",
        "Edmund: Yes, hello. Has cassie winslow checked out please? Oh, good. Thank you. (Phone rings)",
        "Jeffrey: Hello? Hello, is anybody there? Hello?",
        "Dinah: Jeffrey. I told you I was telling you the truth. I tried to warn you. Jeffrey is after cassie.",
        "Tammy: Next on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Josh: Unless you're up for a good old-fashioned lewis/spaulding knock-down, drag-out fight.",
        "Phillip: Might be fun.",
        "Josh: You're making a mistake, phillip.",
        "Cassie: I want you so much.",
        "Jeffrey: And I've wanted you longer than you know."
