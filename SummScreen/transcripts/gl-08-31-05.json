        "Reva: Well, it was a scare for me, too, but I've had worse, believe me. Especially lately. Um, could you get me some water, Sweetie?",

        "Reva: Thanks.",
        "Tammy: It's empty. I'll go get you some more.",

        "Josh: You haven't been released yet, Reva.",

        "Billy: Hey.",
        "Reva: Hey, Billy.",
        "Billy: Look at you. You know, you hear the darndest things at the water cooler. I heard this story about a woman, a beautiful woman, who was practicing her swan-diving over at the Beacon in the elevator instead of the swimming pool.",
        "Reva: Yeah, very funny.",
        "Billy: How are you feeling?",
        "Reva: Guess.",
        "Billy: ( Clears throat ) Rumor has it you're going to challenge that elevator, two out of three.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, I'll tell you one thing. As soon as I get out of here, I am going to take the stairs, thank you very much.",
        "Josh: Reva's just waiting for Rick to give her the okay to go home.",

        "Reva: Oh, Billy, no.",
        "Billy: It's a true story. A true story. By the time that we got unstuck, she had me completely converted. I was down to my skivvies.",

        "Josh: Reva, you're not going anywhere until Rick says it's okay.",

        "Reva: Yeah. Wow.",
        "Billy: That was something else.",
        "Rick: Yeah, we're probably looking at a spasm here.",
        "Josh: A spasm? As opposed to what, Rick? I mean, come on. Maybe this was something that was missed on the x-ray. We've got to know what's going on here.",
        "Rick: The x-ray showed no broken bones. None. I'm going to take another look to see if there's anything else that we might see, because back pain's pretty mysterious. Is it starting to feel better?",
        "Reva: Yeah. Yeah, it's kind of... it's fine.",

        "Ava: I'm glad you think this is funny.",
        "Jonathan: You know what the real joke is? I know about this much more than you do about running a bar. The good thing is that since I don't know how to do it right, you can't screw it up.",
        "Ava: But you know what?",
        "Jonathan: No, look. People are going to come in thirsty. You are going to ask them what they want and then you're going to give it to them. And that's pretty much the gist of it. Oh. And maybe if you cheated this strap and wore a skirt or something, it might help.",
        "Ava: Tell me if you've heard this before: I'm not that kind of girl.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. You might want to think about being that kind of girl. At least when you're here.",

        "Sandy: Mm-hmm. Done. I'm just glad she's alive.",
        "Bill: Yeah. Yeah. Thank God for that. But you know what this is going to mean, right? More pressure over at Lewis, if Josh is tied up nursing Reva.",

        "Sandy: What do you mean?",

        "Bill: Good. Good, good. Good for you, Bud.",
        "Sandy: I should, um, fill her up.",
        "Bill: Yeah, you should do that. Fill it up a little, fill it with a little coffee, maybe, right? That'll be good. Hey, Sandy?",

        "Jonathan: Too late, probably. She in there? Awake?",
        "Tammy: Yeah.",
        "Jonathan: So, where's Sandman? It seems like a perfect hand-holding opportunity for the guy.",
        "Tammy: You should go in.",
        "Jonathan: Uh-oh. Trouble in paradise?",
        "Tammy: Not at all. Sandy's waiting for me and I just hate being late.",

        "Reva: You just need to help me get out of here, please, before Josh gets back.",
        "Jonathan: Are you trying to duck your husband?",
        "Reva: Just help me. Please.",
        "Jonathan: Are you doped up or something? I figured Josh is who you want in your corner most at a time like this.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, what I need and what I can get are two totally different things.",

        "Tammy: Sandy, have you been drinking?",
        "Sandy: I can't stand fighting with you, but I think I can handle making up.",
        "Tammy: Uh, could we... could we just talk for a second, please?",
        "Sandy: Sure. Because I want to talk to you about how wrong it is for people to walk out on people they love. You shouldn't leave someone when you're in the m... when you're in the middle of a...",

        "Tammy: That's new.",
        "Sandy: Is it a big deal?",
        "Tammy: Gee, I don't know. It does make me wonder.",
        "Sandy: About what?",
        "Tammy: If you've got to build up the courage to come apologize. Am I that intimidating?",
        "Sandy: No.",
        "Tammy: Is it that hard to say \"I'm sorry\"?",
        "Sandy: No, no. Not that.",
        "Tammy: Then tell me.",
        "Sandy: It's just... I lost track how many beers I was having because I was busy, too busy, thinking about you.",
        "Tammy: You're cute when you're drunk, but you know what? It hasn't made you any straighter with me. So I'm not interested in your flowers or your apology.",

        "Ava: Yeah, and a little while ago, he left me, a brand-new employee, to run this entire place myself. Does that seem crazy to you?",
        "Bill: That's crazy like Jonathan. Here, let me show you a little something. Pardon me. I'm just going to do this, this. And these are your friends, you see? Like this-- a little dash, a little dash. There it is. There you go. Now, when you look for your hardware, you go abracadabra, ka-tiddly-do, usually you want a shaker, but this will do. What's that? I cut fruit on it. Not today. It's a shaker.",
        "Ava: ( Laughs ) Wow.",

No, no, no, I don't want to wait and see what happens. I believe in preemptive protection. Look, I want you to notarize all our correspondence with the elevator company to show that we've been actively trying to fix the problem with their equipment.",

        "Reva: I don't want to get into it.",
        "Jonathan: It's a little too late to back out now. I come in here and you're practically trying to kill yourself to get away from your hubby. What, something's not cool in Lewis-land?",
        "Reva: No, things are not cool.",
        "Jonathan: You're fighting. Is it because of my father?",
        "Reva: No. It's not because of Alfred. There are other things.",
        "Jonathan: How bad is it?",

        "Billy: Arguing over what?",
        "Josh: A lot of things, Billy. About where we are right now and what we want, and where we're going, and I just finished saying to her that I wasn't ready to move back in with her yet.",
        "Billy: Okay. Well, this is familiar. This is the \"I need a break\" scene.",

        "Reva: You know, in a lot of ways, we're not alike at all.",
        "Jonathan: Then I'm even more at a loss. If you're really hurting, the last thing Josh is going to do is walk away from you, if that's what you're worried about. I mean, come on. You two have been together since the glaciers retreated.",
        "Reva: Doesn't mean a damn thing. Not anymore. He's going to leave me. I know he is. ( Gasps )",

        "Reva: I didn't say that.",

        "Billy: Come on, man. You got her riled up.",
        "Josh: No, it wasn't her anger talking, it was her heart, Billy. She's got this empty space inside of her right now, this bottomless pit created by fear.",
        "Billy: Fear of what? Fear of what?",
        "Josh: Growing older, for one thing. And what else did she say? Losing the ability to walk into a room and have things change because she's there. Feeling less alive.",
        "Billy: Oh, come on. She's never been more of a dynamo than she is now.",
        "Josh: Yeah, that's exactly what I told her, but you know what? She doesn't hear it, Billy. All she knows is that she wants more, and that she needs more. She's Reva, right, so she wants everything, including her youth back. Now, what am I supposed to do with that? What can I possibly do with that? That's why this is different.",
        "Billy: Yeah, this is different.",
        "Josh: After she, you know, finished up that twisted tango thing she had going on with Jonathan's father, she was expecting me to be there waiting for her on the dance floor when she came stumbling off. And of course I was, because that's what I do, you know? But after what she said earlier, I'm starting to ask myself why? Why am I the guy that waits and waits and waits, and then welcomes her with open arms when she comes back and says, \"Reva, I'm so glad you came back to me, even though I wasted a big hunk of my life waiting for you to get here\"? It doesn't matter how long I wait. She's never going to fully come back to me because I'm not worth coming back to. So, what do you think HB would say about all this?",
        "Billy: He'd definitely say, \"Cut her loose.\"",

        "Jonathan: How am I supposed to be the cheerleader, here? You're the family mom. You want to hold on to your husband? Do something.",
        "Reva: I just don't know what would work.",
        "Jonathan: You act like you've never gotten yourself out of a hassle with this guy before.",
        "Reva: I've never been this honest with him before. Some of the things I said to him tonight are things that I can't take back.",
        "Jonathan: You chewed him out?",
        "Reva: Worse.",
        "Rick: Hey. I just need a couple of minutes alone with Reva.",
        "Jonathan: No problem. I'll talk to you later. Yo, yo. What's going on? A little okie update?",
        "Josh: Just catching up. Thanks for coming.",
        "Jonathan: What, to visit Reva? Nah, I just came by to rob the blood bank.",
        "Billy: Sorry to hear about your dad.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, then you're the only one.",
        "Josh: Any word on what's going to happen with the bar?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, word's in. It's mine.",
        "Josh: He left it to you?",
        "Jonathan: It's weird, right? Well, what isn't weird around here nowadays?",
        "Billy: You ever own a bar before?",
        "Jonathan: No, I never owned jack, but I can already tell it's going to be a royal pain in the butt.",
        "Josh: Why is that?",
        "Jonathan: The paperwork sucks! There's, like, insurance...",
        "Billy: ( Laughs )",
        "Jonathan: ...Suppliers, payroll, taxes.",
        "Billy: Welcome to the real world of business, my boy.",
        "Jonathan: No, I mean, I can... the booze part of it, I can get into that, but the other crap, I don't know. I'm going to need a partner or something to help me with all that boring stuff.",
        "Billy: You're going to need a partner? Well, you know, if you're serious about that, how about me? ( Laughter )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: You know what? I've got another idea. Just go over the track record of the elevator company and see if they've had problems like this in the past. You know, the more we can...",
        "Bill: ( Sighs ) Okay, I know what you're thinking. \"How long can she go on like that?\" Well, I'll tell you: As long as it takes, because Olivia is a world class problem solver, and she's good on her feet. What a woman.",
        "Ava: I wish I was as confident as she is. That strong.",
        "Bill: Yeah, me, too. ( Laughs ) Mm.",
        "Ava: I'm... I'm okay as long as I can practice before I actually am with someone, speaking.",
        "Bill: Yeah? Well, you know, I've got to tell you something. You can't pre-plan everything, you know? Because sometimes people don't go by the script that you have in mind.",
        "Ava: That's why I screw up a lot. ( Laughs )",
        "Bill: Yeah, well. ( Laughs ) Yeah.",
        "Ava: What's funny?",
        "Bill: Well, I used to be like that myself.",
        "Ava: Oh, I don't believe that for one second. Give me a break. You and your wife, you seem so confident.",
        "Bill: And we are. ( Laughs ) No, it just takes a little time and a little effort, that's all. What's your name? You have a name tag?",
        "Ava: Ava.",
        "Bill: Ava. Nice to meet you. Bill.",
        "Ava: Hi.",
        "Bill: Bill Lewis.",
        "Ava: Bill.",
        "Bill: But seriously, we all start out a little clueless, all of us. We all do. Even a clod as devastatingly savvy as myself.",
        "Ava: ( Laughs )",
        "Bill: But seriously, can we do a little business?",
        "Ava: Okay.",
        "Bill: How about another drink?",
        "Ava: Oh. Oh, yeah, sure. No problem. Sorry. I'll be right back with two more.",
        "Bill: Sure.",
        "Ava: Um... and thank you.",
        "Bill: For what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: If I... if I could turn back the clock to right before I walked out on you, I would. We... we were having a great time, weren't we?",
        "Tammy: Yeah, we were.",
        "Sandy: Forgive me?",
        "Tammy: I'll be honest with you, Sandy. I love you. But I don't know if we'll have any more of those great times, or any times at all, if we can't get out of this pattern that we're stuck in where I ask you about your life and you just shut down or walk away.",
        "Sandy: I'm... I'm... I'm sorry.",
        "Tammy: Well, you've said that before, but it's not enough. Something's got to change.",
        "Sandy: What you're saying is that I've got to change.",
        "Tammy: We've got to be able to find a balance between what I'd like to know about you and what you're willing to tell me.",
        "Sandy: I do trust you.",
        "Tammy: Well, you don't show it, and I can't live with that anymore. Don't you have anything to say?",
        "Sandy: No. But I... I do want to show you that trust that you're looking for.",
        "Tammy: Sandy, what's your problem?",
        "Sandy: My problem is that I think I knew deep down I was going to have to do this, and I was going to have to level with you. That's why I started drinking.",
        "Tammy: Is it that hard for you to open up?",
        "Sandy: There's nothing interesting about me.",
        "Tammy: It's interesting that this is so hard for you.",
        "Sandy: And there's not much to say. I don't talk about myself because it's better left to people's imaginations. Maybe they can just pretend that something cool has happened in my life, because it hasn't. You're cool because you've had experiences, right? Well, it's not like growing up I had anyone to help me have those experiences. I was alone.",
        "Tammy: No brothers or sisters?",
        "Sandy: Nope.",
        "Tammy: Your parents?",
        "Sandy: Well, there's my dad. But he left us before I really was old enough to get to know him.",
        "Tammy: Well, you weren't entirely alone. You said \"us.\"",
        "Sandy: My mother. There was my mother. When my father left, she said that I wouldn't be missing much.",
        "Tammy: What's your mom like?",
        "Sandy: She's dead. She got sick. I took care of her. I didn't want to believe she would leave me like my father did, but a year later, I was alone.",
        "Tammy: That must have been awful.",
        "Sandy: It's cool. I kept myself busy by acting out. You know, by the time I was a teenager, I was in pretty rough shape, but I managed to pull it together-- except for that \"pretending to be Jonathan\" thing. And that's it. That's my story. Told you. Not exciting.",
        "Tammy: I'm sorry. I know it still hurts, but doesn't it feel good to share it?",
        "Sandy: You wanted to know my story. It's all out in the open. All of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Thanks. Okay, well, that's done, I hope.",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Olivia: Cheers. Good martini.",
        "Bill: It is. It is.",
        "Olivia: I can't drink it, though, because I have to go and make sure that the lawyer has got everything.",
        "Ava: Excuse me? I know you wanted to leave a message for Jonathan. I can do that for you, if you'd like.",
        "Olivia: No, it's not necessary, but thank you very much.",
        "Bill: \"Good martini.\" That's a direct quote. See you, Ava.",
        "Ava: Bye. Hey! ( Sighs )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: You want to partner up in a bar with Jonathan?",
        "Billy: It's an idea.",
        "Josh: Are you...",
        "Billy: Crazy?",
        "Josh: ...Insane?",
        "Billy: Crazy.",
        "Josh: Billy.",
        "Billy: No, I am bored.",
        "Josh: What, with work?",
        "Billy: Yeah. Lewis Construction runs itself, with Bill there.",
        "Josh: Let's get back to the crazy part.",
        "Billy: Okay, yeah, I know, putting an alcoholic in charge of a bar is like taking a wolf and putting him in charge of the sheep. But, you've got to remember that I ran Top of the Towers.",
        "Josh: Yeah, and the roadhouse.",
        "Jonathan: Are you kidding?",
        "Billy: Being a drunk doesn't mean you necessarily get drunk when you're around the stuff that does it.",
        "Josh: No, it just means you have to be a hell of a lot more careful.",
        "Billy: Yeah. I'm careful, Josh. I'm careful every day, one day at a time. But look, the kid... I think he's in a little over his head here, and he needs our help, he is family. So what do you say?",
        "Jonathan: I think it just might work.",
        "Josh: Jonathan...",
        "Jonathan: No, I mean, Billy's always been a straight shooter with me, which is cool, and I need somebody who can show me the ropes without strangling me with them.",
        "Billy: ( Laughs ) I like the way you talk. We going to okie up or what? ( Laughter )",
        "Josh: Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey. Can we just talk about this? Privately?",
        "Jonathan: Knock yourself out. And then we'll talk.",
        "Billy: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: So, Dr. Gunther and I both agree it's just a muscle spasm.",
        "Reva: Then I can go home?",
        "Rick: Yes. Just take your medication and take it easy.",
        "Reva: Taking happy drugs and no hard work? Those are doctor's orders I can live with.",
        "Rick: All right. We'll monitor you a little closely here, and just make sure nothing else turns into a serious situation, all right? This is an emergency, Reva, I've got to go. I'll check with you in a day or so.",
        "Reva: Thanks, Rick.",
        "Rick: All right.",
        "Josh: Rick, what's the deal?",
        "Rick: Josh, I can't talk right now. I've got to deal with an emergency. Reva can fill you in on everything. Excuse me.",
        "Jonathan: Hey. You want to keep Josh from going bye-bye? You've got a primo opportunity staring you right in the face.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Ah, yeah, you forgot these.",
        "Olivia: What?",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Olivia: I didn't realize I did that. Thank you.",
        "Bill: Well, Ava did. This is Ava, by the way. She signaled me. You didn't see her. But isn't that nice of her?",
        "Olivia: It was. It was very, very nice. I appreciate that. Listen, I'm so sorry, but the lawyer's on the clock.",
        "Bill: Yeah, yeah. Okay. I'm right behind you. I'm coming right behind you. Don't worry, your secret is safe with me. PS, I try on her stuff all the time.",
        "Ava: ( Laughs )",
        "Bill: Hey. Can I ask you something?",
        "Ava: Does it have anything to do with scarves or sunglasses?",
        "Bill: No, no, no. Well, maybe scarves.",
        "Ava: Okay. ( Laughs )",
        "Bill: This job here, this thing at the bar, is it something that you want to do, or do you want to move on to bigger and better things?",
        "Ava: It really doesn't matter too much right now because I'm sort of stuck here, at least for a while.",
        "Bill: Money thing?",
        "Ava: Yeah.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, I'll tell you what. When you get a little unstuck, why don't you give Olivia a call, because she's always looking for new people to use. I mean, for business. Use for business. In fact, I think she's looking for an assistant right now.",
        "Ava: Really?",
        "Bill: Yeah. Yeah. So if you think you fit the bill, then why don't you give her a call? Are you familiar with all the major business programs?",
        "Ava: I am. I am, actually. All of them. I'm on the computer tons. I'm actually a student at the university.",
        "Bill: Yeah?",
        "Ava: Yeah.",
        "Bill: Well, that sounds great, and if this is something that interests you, why don't you give her a call? What?",
        "Ava: It's just that you're being so nice to me and I just met you.",
        "Bill: If you're nice to me, I'm nice to you. We're even.",
        "Ava: ( Laughs )",
        "Bill: Just pass it on. Good night.",
        "Ava: Good night.",

        "Tammy: Question.",
        "Sandy: Again?",
        "Tammy: Just out of curiosity, was holding off on telling me all this really worth the hangover you're going to have tomorrow?",
        "Sandy: Tomorrow? With any luck, my hangover can kick in while it's still dark.",
        "Tammy: You can tell me anything, you know. Anything. I won't judge you for it, I promise.",
        "Sandy: And I want to share everything with you.",
        "Tammy: Well, it seems like we've come full circle.",
        "Sandy: I hope so.",

        "Reva: You heard him talking to Dr... What, were you eavesdropping?",
        "Jonathan: No. Look, the point is, Dr. Bauer is in a rush, didn't have time to tell Josh what he told you, that the spasms are nothing and you're probably going to be okay.",
        "Reva: So Josh didn't hear what Rick told me. So what?",
        "Jonathan: The point is that you can tell Josh that you're not okay and he won't know that you're just adjusting the truth.",
        "Reva: You mean lying?",
        "Jonathan: Whatever. You want him to stick around or not? Look, you tell him that you are a mess, that you're a basket case, one slip on a wet floor away from permanent paralysis. That guy will stick to you so close, he'll be like that table.",
        "Reva: Even if I were willing to do that-- which I'm not saying I am-- I can't. That would be like lying.",
        "Jonathan: You don't have to do it forever. Don't worry about it. You just do it long enough to make the guy stick around. It's not a big deal. Come on. This will give you enough time to work on the guy.",
        "Reva: You're making this sound like some kind of a brainwashing project.",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) Maybe it is. So what? You got a better idea? Eyes on the prize, Mama.",
        "Josh: Hey. I picked up your prescription. How are you feeling?",
        "Reva: Okay, I guess.",
        "Josh: I ran into Rick. I asked him how you were doing, but he was in a hurry. He said that he gave you all the details.",
        "Jonathan: Hm. I... I'd love to stick around to hear the details again but I've got a bar to run. You take care, Reva. Yeah? Hey. Feel better.",
