        "Olivia: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, baby. I'll never leave you alone again. I \r\nshould have known better than to trust anyone. Should have known. ",
        "Buzz: You don't mean that. Why don't you take a break? Go out stretch your \r\nlegs for a second. ",
        "Olivia: Last time I left her alone, look what happened. Why did I leave her \r\nwith Ava? Was I insane? ",
        "Buzz: It was an accident. It could have happened on anybody's watch. She \r\ndidn't mean to hurt her? ",
        "Olivia: How do you know? ",
        "Buzz: Ava's a good kid. Give her a chance. Be fair. ",
        "Olivia: Be fair? Is this fair? ",
        "",
        "Ava: Why won't she call already? ",
        "Coop: Who? ",
        "Ava: The nurse from Cedars. She said she would call me the minute Emma \r\nrecovered. And now the phone's not working and now I'm wondering and worrying \r\nthat something's wrong. ( Phone rings ) Hello? Yes, you're order is ready. Why \r\ndon't you come down here and pick it up! ",
        "Coop: Would you please-- look at me-- can you just go a little easier? Okay. \r\nEmma is not going to die. Okay? She's not. ",
        "Ava: Why didn't I check on her when I put her to bed? ",
        "Coop: Stop it. Emma drank that perfume of her own free will. You are not to \r\nblame here. ",
        "Ava: Olivia is blaming me. Buzz is blaming me. ",
        "Coop: Buzz is blaming you? Buzz is not blaming you. He's on your side. ",
        "Ava: The only thing that matters right now is that little girl. And I cannot \r\nbreathe until I know this she's okay. ",
        "",
        "Mel: Yeah, I'm just walking into a meeting. ",
        "Rick: Okay, so how does the rest of your day shape up? ",
        "Mel: Busy. It's complicated case. ",
        "Rick: Too complicated to get a cup coffee? ",
        "Mel: I'd love to, Rick, but-- ",
        "Rick: How about we just turn that around. \"But Rick, I would love to.\" ",
        "Mel: I'm sorry. I can\u2019t. We'll touch base later. ",
        "Rick: So is that all we're doing now just touching base? ",
        "Mel: Rick, I'm sorry, okay, I'll see you at home. ",
        "Rick: Right, I'll see you at home. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Must be nice to have someone at home. ",
        "Rick: You could find someone, cuz but you just got to look a little bit. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Just so hard to choose. But I do envy you for being in a solid \r\nrelationship. Nice and peaceful. No folder on the \"Springfield Burns\" web site.\r\n",
        "Rick: Yeah. I got to go. Good seeing you again. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Off to meet your girlfriend for a nooner? ",
        "Rick: Excuse me? ",
        "Alan-Michael: It's a joke. I'll see you later, cuz. ",
        "Rick: You alone? ",
        "Beth: Well, except a few shopping bags. You want to see what I bought? ",
        "Rick: Not particularly. But I would like to see you. Can you take a break?\r\n",
        "Beth: You know what? I was hoping that you would say that. Give me an hour to \r\nget a few things done and freshen up. ",
        "Rick: I'm setting my watch. You got exactly 59 minutes and 30 seconds. ",
        "Beth: Why do I foal like I'm in high school? ",
        "Rick: I don't know, Beth. I mean I keep asking myself the same question. \r\nListen, I'll see you in a few, okay? Bye. What the hell am I doing? ",
        "",
        "Jonathan: So, this is everything I can think of about Alan Spaulding-- A.K.A. \r\nMr. Tashiwa, apparently by Reva Shayne Lewis. ",
        "Mel: Okay. Thanks. It might help. ",
        "Tammy: You don't sound too optimistic. ",
        "Mel: I'm not. I mean Alan has a really good case. ",
        "Lizzie: Except that I'm not crazy and I'm not a danger to my baby. ",
        "Tammy: We know that. ",
        "Mel: Right. But if I'm honest, you're erratic behavior doesn't help. I mean \r\nyou took a shot at your granddad. ",
        "Lizzie: There's got to be something I can do. ",
        "Mel: Well, if I were you and I wanted to keep my baby, I would stay as far \r\naway from Jonathan as possible. ",
        "Jonathan: What the hell is this? I'm the father of that kid. Or did you \r\nforget that? ",
        "Mel: You've also been accused of arson, of serving drinks to a minor, not to \r\nmention you're not the D.A.'s favorite person. Add your baggage to Lizzie\u2019s, \r\nAlan comes out looking like the pope. He's going to win this case. ",
        "Jonathan: You think they're going to come after me? ",
        "Mel: With both barrels. ",
        "Lizzie: I don't care. My daughter is not going to grow up without her father. \r\nThe three of us are a team. Win or lose we're going to win this case. Right? ",
        "Mel: Okay. We need testimony from anyone you can find that will have sympathy \r\nfor you in this case, okay if you can find them, have them contact me. ",
        "Lizzie: I'm on it. ",
        "Jonathan: Wow. Okay. So, Mel, do we have a chance? ",
        "Mel: There's always a chance. As long as you don't do anything questionable, \r\nlike have Alan try to throw you off a balcony. ",
        "Jonathan: Scout's honor. Promise. But I do have a fish that I could catch. So \r\nif we're done here... ",
        "Mel: Wait, wait, wait. What's the plan? ",
        "Jonathan: Just strictly legal. It's some detective work. I mean you trust me, \r\ndon't you? ",
        "Tammy: No. ( Laughter ) ",
        "Jonathan: See? That's why I love this girl. ",
        "Mel: He's going to get into trouble, isn't he? ",
        "Tammy: Probably. But his heart's in the right place. ",
        "Mel: What about your heart? I mean, your boyfriend and Lizzie are about to \r\nhave a baby-- you're okay with that? ",
        "Tammy: Of course not. But Jonathan made a mistake while we were separated. I \r\ndon't love what he did. But I love him. And I want him to know his child. ",
        "Mel: When do you draw the line and just walk away? ",
        "Tammy: I never considered it. Jonathan and I have had tough times, but it has \r\nonly made us stronger. If you love somebody you can make it through anything, \r\nright? ",
        "",
        "Rick: I got to go. Thank you very much. Keep the change. ",
        "",
        "Blake: You. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Me? ",
        "Blake: Yes. Why hasn't the C.E.O. of Spaulding endorsed me for mayor? ",
        "Alan-Michael: Sleeping with all the Spaulding men isn't exactly a \r\nqualification. ",
        "Blake: So what do I have to do to get the company vote? ",
        "Alan-Michael: I did see the video of you and Jeffrey O\u2019Neill in \"Springfield \r\nBurns.\" ",
        "Blake: It's not funny. My number is plummeted after that thing aired. You \r\nknow I practically lost the entire conservative vote. I'm going to have to \r\nreinvent myself. Go for the younger vote. New image. New wardrobe. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Still look good to me. ",
        "Blake: Still, what's up with that? It's like everybody sees me as this old \r\nwidow. Alan-Michael, why do people not see my potential? ",
        "Alan-Michael: Tell you what, come back when I can see all that potential and \r\nI might give you my endorsement. I want to experience the new Blake. Not on \r\n\"Springfield Burns.\" ",
        "Blake: You don't have to worry because I'm not going to do everything that \r\nwill merit me getting back on that thing. I could kill whoever's behind it. ",
        "Alan-Michael: You and everybody else. I can't believe the way that loser's \r\nripping through this town. There's a bounty out, you know. ",
        "Blake: No kidding? Who do you think's behind it. ",
        "Alan-Michael: You? Where are you getting the money? ",
        "Blake: I was thinking of taking up a collection. Alms for the screwed. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Count me in. ",
        "Olivia: You might be able to forgive Ava for what she did, I can't, Buzz. ",
        "Buzz: Get past this. ",
        "Olivia: No, I can\u2019t. You might be able to. I know what happened. I know \r\nwhat's going on. She thinks I tried to kill her, that I left her to die in that \r\nfire, she couldn't get to me now she's going after Emma. ",
        "Buzz: That's not what happened. It was an accident. Just an accident. Honey, \r\nlook, we've got-- this isn't good for any of us. You, me, anybody. We got to get \r\npast that. We've got to patch things up, come together somehow. I mean, if \r\nthere's one thing the Cooper\u2019s are good at, it's when someone's in trouble, \r\nrallying around them. So please let us be here. For you. For both of you. Okay?\r\n",

        "Lizzie: Hi, Karen. Is my grandmother here? Please don't say no; I'm really \r\ndesperate. ",
        "Coop: Why? What's wrong? Is this about the baby? ",
        "Lizzie: Yes. No, the baby is fine, but... why are you here? ",
        "Coop: I'm here to see your little sister. She drank a whole bottle of white \r\nroses. ",
        "Lizzie: Is she okay? ",
        "Coop: Well, I think so. ",
        "Lizzie: I can't believe how hard it is to be a mom. You take your eyes off \r\nthem for a second and something goes wrong. ",
        "Coop: That's the thing. Ava didn't exactly take her eyes off. She put her to \r\nbed, but she didn't know she had the bottle with her. ",
        "Lizzie: How would she? ",
        "Coop: Right. How would she? ",
        "Lizzie: Motherhood is such a huge responsibility. Truth is, I'm kind of \r\nscared. ",
        "Coop: You know, Lizzie, I think you're going to do all right. ",
        "",
        "Buzz: I'm trying to help you. You keep shutting me out. Are you really that \r\nafraid to depend on anyone? ",
        "Olivia: I know what happens when I do. ",
        "Buzz: They all leave? ",
        "Olivia: Always, Buzz, always. ",
        "Buzz: Is that what you're going to teach her? Is that what Emma is going to \r\nlearn, that you can't depend on anybody but herself? ",
        "Olivia: You better believe it. ",
        "Buzz: That's hog wash. Forget about this, I don't care about anybody. No one \r\ncares about you. I do. I love you. There was a time when I didn't think I'd ever \r\ncare about anyone the way I care about you. But it was a gift given to me by my \r\nfamily. And I had to work hard to deserve it. And something I'm trying to give \r\nyou, that you're going to have to work hard to accept. ",
        "Olivia: What if I can't? ",
        "Buzz: I'll still be here. ",
        "Olivia: Only to disappoint you. ",
        "Buzz: So I'll be disappointed. I'm not going anywhere. And neither is the \r\nrest of my family. Which, by the way, Frank is on his way right now. ",
        "Olivia: Frank is coming here? ",
        "Buzz: Uh-huh. Right now. And I think he's going to have a word or two to say \r\nabout your grudge with Ava. ",
        "Olivia: It is a grudge. It's not doing anybody any good. I need to let it go.\r\n",
        "Coop: I just want to check on Emma. ",
        "Olivia: Glad you came. Is Ava with you? ",

        "Ava: Emma? Is she awake? ",
        "Coop: No. I'm sorry she's still the same. It's Olivia, and she wants to you \r\ncome down here right now. ",
        "Ava: Is she armed? ",
        "Coop: Ava, she's being really sincere. Tell what you, look, I'll cover for \r\nyou at Co2, but I think that you should get down here and talk to her before the \r\nmoment is lost. I don't know what my dad did, but he must have worked his magic.\r\n",
        "",
        "Frank: I'm sorry I'm late. I couldn't get away. ",
        "Olivia: It's okay. I'm glad you came. No matter what's happened between us \r\nyou still make me feel safe. ",
        "Frank: I brought her favorite stuffed animal. Emma, I brought your favorite \r\nlittle bunny that used to make you laugh. She's going to be okay. So are you.\r\n",
        "",
        "Lizzie: You so have to help me. Granddad's gone off his rocker. He's taking \r\nme to court. He's trying to prove that I'm insane he says that my behavior has \r\nbeen erratic. ",
        "Lillian: Your behavior is a little risky. ",
        "Lizzie: All pregnant women freak out a little bit. You of all people should \r\nknow that. After I have the baby it will be okay. I'll be a great mother. ",
        "Lillian: You do realize raising a child is a lot of work. ",
        "Lizzie: I know that! I practically raised myself in Arizona. ",
        "Lillian: I know, I know. ",
        "Lizzie: No! I was like the mother. Mom was out of control. It was hard \r\nsometimes. And I protected her, just like I'm going to protect my little girl.\r\n",
        "Lillian: You realize your mother did all she could. She did the best job \r\npossible. ",
        "Lizzie: Yes, I know that she loves me, okay, I know. I'm trying to prove to \r\nyou that I'm fit. So that you could testify for me against granddad. Would you \r\ndo that for me? ",
        "Lillian: Honey, you know how much I love you. But your mother's worried, \r\nwe're all worried that you're attaching yourself very much like that man in \r\nArizona, who's name you don't like to mention. ",
        "Lizzie: Jonathan is nothing like Carl! He would never do anything to hurt me \r\nor my baby. ",
        "Lillian: Your mother told me a lot of things he has-- ",
        "Lizzie: Forget all of that! Forget all of that. Listen to me. He is \r\nwonderful. And I couldn't be doing this right now if it wasn't for him, he gets \r\nme. I mean, he gets me. Knowing him has completely changed my life. ",

        "Coop: Ava said she would be here any minute, so uh... look, Dad, I don't know \r\nwhat you said to Olivia in there. But thank you. ",
        "Buzz: I don't think Olivia really believes that Ava meant to hurt Emma \r\nanymore than Ava believes that Olivia left her in the fire to die. ",
        "Coop: That's the story Ava\u2019s sticking to, though. ",
        "Buzz: Oh, come on. This is not our fight. This is the-- we -- ",
        "Coop: I know. You don't have to finish it. In the end we're Cooper\u2019s. And we \r\nfight, then we make up. ",
