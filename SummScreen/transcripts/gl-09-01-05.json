        "Dinah: Hi. Okay, firstly, where the hell are you? Secondly, Cassie is here. The stage is set, the mood is right, it's time to step up to the plate.",
        "Edmund: Dinah, I don't understand.",
        "Dinah: Just get over here right now.",
        "Edmund: I'll be there as soon as I can.",
        "Dinah: No, that's not good enough.",
        "Edmund: ( Laughs ) Dinah, relax.",
        "Dinah: Relax? How do you expect me to relax when my water is supposed to break? Do you want me to go into labor? Do you want me to go in labor and say, \"Hi, surprise. Hi, everybody, you've got a beautiful bouncing baby pillow\"?",
        "Edmund: Dinah...",
        "Dinah: \"And congratulations. That pillow, Cassie, that has your eyes.\" No, you know what? I'm going to tell her there's no baby.",
        "Edmund: No, Dinah. Give me time.",
        "Dinah: Edmund, stop asking for time. I'm getting sick of it.",
        "Edmund: Dinah, I'm working on a surprise.",
        "Dinah: What do you mean? What kind of surprise?",
        "Edmund: It's for us. A surprise, for us, just the two of us. Just, please, Dinah, stall. Stall for as long as you can. I promise you, Dinah, please. I promise you this is all going to work out. You just have to trust me.",
        "Dinah: Hurry up.",
        "Cassie: I brought some pillows.",
        "Dinah: ( Gasps ) I'm sorry. I, um, I'm having jitters, you know? I think that the baby could come as soon as tonight.",
        "Cassie: I sure hope so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Michelle Santos. Have you seen her?",
        "Waitress: I haven't.",
        "Edmund: How about Marina Cooper?",
        "Waitress: It's her night off.",
        "Edmund: Damn it.",
        "Jeffrey: Ah, Edmund. Got a minute?",
        "Edmund: No.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, could you make some time? It's about the baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: I think it was a really good idea for us to stay in tonight.",
        "Danny: Me, too.",
        "Marina: But somebody has to go get the pickup, for the takeout.",
        "Danny: Okay, go ahead. Come on. Can't we just order room service? I mean, it's right downstairs.",
        "Marina: No.",
        "Danny: We could just pick up...",
        "Marina: Buzz burgers are not on the Beacon menu.",
        "Danny: ( Groans )",
        "Marina: Besides, if you go, I'll put on something to make it all worth your while.",
        "Danny: Can't we just skip to that part? Come on. I can help you put it on, and then...",
        "Marina: Santos!",
        "Danny: ...Help you take it off.",
        "Marina: Food. Go. Go on. The quicker you go, the faster you'll come back.",
        "Danny: All right. ( Knock on door ) If we're lucky, that'll be room service and they read our minds.",
        "Rick: Hey, Danny.",
        "Danny: Hey, Rick.",
        "Rick: Oh, hi, Marina. I'm sorry to interrupt you. Did you find Michelle?",
        "Marina: I didn't know you were looking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Of course you love Marina, Danny. Of course you do. Why wouldn't you? But she's selfless. She's been there for you when I was nowhere to be found. What did I think she was, a placeholder for me? ( Gasps ) Okay. Okay, okay, that's another one. And this is too soon, baby. No, no, this is too soon. Okay? You're starting labor too soon. ( Gasping ) I know you want to see the world, but you're going to have to wait, Honey. You're going to have to do Mommy a favor, you're going to have to wait until I can get us to a hospital, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Are you having contractions? I'm going to call the hospital. I'm going to tell them what's going on with you.",
        "Dinah: No. No, no, no, no.",
        "Cassie: But you just said the baby was coming.",
        "Dinah: If the baby's coming tonight.",
        "Cassie: ( Sighs ) Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. I'm just, like, a little overreacting, and I'm just... I'm sorry. Here, look. I'm just...",
        "Dinah: Okay, yeah.",
        "Cassie: I'm probably hovering now. Now I'm hovering.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, no. Just stop apologizing every five seconds. You're acting like Florence Nightingale on steroids, okay? Let's just let this thing take its course, okay?",
        "Cassie: Right. I just want to help you, Dinah. I do. I know how difficult labor and delivery can be.",
        "Dinah: I know that. I know. I know. And I think we just shouldn't talk about it, you know?",
        "Cassie: Okay, sure. You're right.",
        "Dinah: I think I need to breathe. I think I need to breathe and allow my nerves just to calm down.",
        "Cassie: I can make you some tea.",
        "Dinah: Cassie...",
        "Cassie: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",
        "Dinah: Cassie.",
        "Cassie: I'm sorry. Dinah, come on. I just... I want to... I don't know what I can do to help you.",
        "Dinah: I think you just need to allow me to enjoy all of my pregnant glory, okay, and stop thinking that there's something you need to do.",
        "Cassie: All right. We could talk about baby names. You know, Edmund and I kicked around a few that we didn't discuss with you.",
        "Dinah: Okay. Well, I don't know if you really need to share that.",
        "Cassie: It'll be fun.",
        "Dinah: You know what I think would be best right now?",
        "Cassie: If I shut up.",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Yeah, I would. You know why? Because I'm a little embarrassed here because I'm feeling a little guilty because really, there's nothing we need to talk about and there's nothing that we need to do.",
        "Cassie: Who do you think you're fooling?",
        "Dinah: What do you mean?",
        "Cassie: I'm just sitting here waiting for you to finally come clean and admit it. So when are you finally going to tell me, Dinah?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: You have something to say about the baby? What? What is it? Because if you have any accusations to make, I suggest you have something to back it up.",
        "Jeffrey: I was just going to say that, you know, the baby is going to be born any day now. As a matter of fact, it could be born today.",
        "Edmund: Great. I assume you have a point?",
        "Jeffrey: Your baby is also Cassie's baby, and as you know, Cassie is a big part of my life now.",
        "Edmund: Please don't tell me you're trying to lay claim to this child.",
        "Jeffrey: No, but I do intend to be a part of this child's life.",
        "Edmund: Great. You want to be included. Fantastic, Uncle Jeff. Welcome to the fold. Is there anything else?",
        "Waitress: Marina... voice mail again. Marina. I got your takeout here. Can you come pick it up, please?",
        "Jeffrey: You know, Edmund, we've been through a lot over the time that I've been, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Hmm?",
        "Jeffrey: I don't feel like I have your full attention here.",
        "Edmund: That's because you don't. I'm about to have a baby, Mr. O'Neill. I am at my wits' end, and you have us tangled up in some sort of male bonding moment with which neither one of us is comfortable. Excuse me. I can take that food to Marina. She's probably just tied up with Danny somewhere. Not literally, of course.",
        "Waitress: Um, sure.",
        "Edmund: Thank you.",
        "Jeffrey: Edmund, we're kind of in the middle of something here.",
        "Edmund: And there will be plenty of time to figure out how we're going to coexist once the baby is born, but I personally believe, Mr. O'Neill, that that won't be necessary, as that once the baby arrives, you will become a distant memory for all involved. Now, I understand that may sting a little bit, but you've got to live with it. Now, if you'll excuse me, Marina's food is getting cold.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Okay, see, you know what's lucky about this? It's that one of us has done this before. Yep. See, Mommy has been in labor before. Been there, survived that. Plus I am a medical trained professional. Bet you didn't know that, huh? Oh, okay. Okay, here we go. ( Rhythmic breathing ) Okay, Michelle, just breathe. Okay. Don't, don't, don't... don't push, please. Just breathe. You can breathe. ( Rhythmic breathing ) Okay. Okay, I know you really want to see me, Honey, but you've just got to wait, okay? You're just going to have to wait a little while. All right, I'm going to, um... I'm going to call your Uncle Rick. I'm going to call him and tell him that we are on our way to the hospital, okay? We're going to give him... ow. Oh, no. ( Gasping ) no. No, not... not yet, please. Okay. Okay, no, no. I want to push. I want to push and I'm not going to push because I can't. We both know that I can't push right now. I've got to make this call. All right, I've got to make this call. Okay. Oh, God. Oh, no. ( Tires squealing )",

        "Danny: Marina, I was looking for Michelle earlier today because she called Robbie at camp...",
        "Marina: Danny?",
        "Danny: ...And it made him homesick.",
        "Marina: Why don't you quit while you're ahead? You don't need to explain.",
        "Rick: Did you find my sister?",
        "Danny: No, I didn't. In fact, she then called me to tell me that she was on her way to Washington to see your Uncle Mike. Why? Is there a problem?",
        "Rick: No, I just expected to hear something from her by now. This is just so weird. Listen, I'm sorry. I barged in. I'll talk to you later.",
        "Danny: Rick? Hey, wait up. What's wrong?",
        "Rick: Well, nothing. Nothing. Should there be something wrong? Why?",
        "Danny: Well, you went out of your way to find me here and you're a terrible liar-- you always have been.",
        "Marina: Maybe Michelle is just busy.",
        "Rick: Busy doing what?",
        "Danny: What? I mean, like, too busy to see her son?",
        "Marina: Okay, I'm staying out of this.",
        "Danny: No, Marina, we're just... we're both very concerned and surprised by Michelle's behavior.",
        "Marina: And all I'm saying is that it's not like Michelle has to answer to anyone, right? She's a grown woman. She can take care of herself.",
        "Rick: Are you kidding? In her condition?",
        "Danny: What are you talking about? What condition?",
        "Danny: Rick?",
        "Rick: Yeah?",
        "Danny: What kind of condition is Michelle in?",
        "Rick: She's just under stress, that's it. It's nothing.",
        "Danny: Stress? You were talking about stress.",
        "Rick: It's just nothing. It's really nothing. You know? Hey, I'm just doing the big brother overprotective thing. You've seen that before, right?",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Rick: So it's nothing. I'll see you later.",
        "Danny: All right. Hey. So, let's stay in touch with each other about this, okay?",
        "Rick: Do me a favor. If she calls you, please call me, would you?",
        "Danny: I will, I will. I think it's really important that we both help her get things back on track.",
        "Marina: For Robbie's sake.",
        "Rick: Right, for Robbie. Listen, I'll talk to you later, okay?",
        "Danny: All right. Hey. I was not going to tell you about me looking for Michelle today.",
        "Marina: Right. But you just didn't think it was a big deal.",
        "Danny: No, that's...",
        "Marina: I mean, just like you didn't think it was a big deal to tell me she was back in town.",
        "Danny: No. Stop. Stop. No. Because I got sidetracked as soon as I saw you today and what happened to you. That's why.",
        "Marina: Danny, look. Michelle is an important part of your life.",
        "Danny: I know.",
        "Marina: You are an important part of mine. Thus, Michelle is an important part of my life whether I like it or not. Okay? But if you feel like you can't talk to me about her, then we have a problem.",

        "Rick: Thanks, Elaine. Just call me if you see her anywhere. Excuse me.",
        "Edmund: Rick. Rick, I'm sorry. Look, my apologies...",
        "Rick: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What's going on with you? Are you on something?",
        "Edmund: Am I what? Oh, please, Rick. Just get out.",
        "Rick: Listen. I let you slip by last time, but not this time.",

        "Dinah: What are you implying, Cassie? What do you think is going on with me?",
        "Cassie: I'm not blind, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Jeffrey: Hello, Ladies! Dinner is served.",
        "Cassie: That is nice.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I knew you were going to be staying in tonight, so I figured you had enough on your plate-- pardon the pun-- without having to worry about cooking.",
        "Cassie: You're so sweet.",
        "Jeffrey: And Dinah, Cassie told me that you had a severe craving for cheese fries the other night, so le voila.",
        "Dinah: Thank you. The idea of the two of you thinking of me is... well, have you ever had the feeling that your life was happening without you?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I try to let my life know who's boss.",
        "Cassie: Oh, yeah? How's that working for you?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, we're at a stalemate.",
        "Cassie: ( Laughs )",
        "Dinah: Well, I don't mean to sound so melodramatic. I'm just saying, you know, you get this feeling sometimes that life has to be a certain way or whatever just because that's what you're used to.",
        "Cassie: I think I know what's going on. There's a lot of water under the bridge with us. It's okay. You don't have to be a slave to your past, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: I don't think I've known any other way to be.",
        "Jeffrey: I have another surprise for you outside.",
        "Cassie: I don't want to leave Dinah alone.",
        "Dinah: No, it's all right. You don't have to hold my hand every second. Go.",
        "Cassie: Okay, we'll be right outside.",
        "Jeffrey: ( Chuckles )",
        "Dinah: Somebody's playing a game. I can smell it.",
        "Cassie: Wow. So, let's see. Picnics. You've serenaded me. What else is there? Car seats. Are you going to buy me diamonds? Are you going to take me on a trip to Paris?",
        "Jeffrey: What do you think?",
        "Cassie: A truck.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: Whose truck is... you traded your little hot two-seater for a truck?",
        "Jeffrey: She's gone.",
        "Cassie: That is such a sacrifice. You loved your car.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I love some other things a lot more. Besides, think of the fun we're going to have when we take her off-road.",
        "Cassie: So we're not going to drive that thing around the town of Springfield, pretending to be rugged individualists?",
        "Jeffrey: No, we're going to strap the baby into the back and we're going to hit Tierra del Fuego.",
        "Cassie: ( Laughs ) Well, I would settle for, you know, Lake Michigan.",
        "Jeffrey: You're on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Rick, I'm not going to stand here and listen to you go on about me being on drugs. So, if you'll excuse me, I'm going.",
        "Rick: What's the hurry? Where are you going?",
        "Edmund: Well, if you have to know, I'm on my way to my addicts' support group meeting.",
        "Rick: So, why don't I believe you, Edmund?",
        "Edmund: I don't care whether you believe me or not.",
        "Rick: Let me take you to Cedars right now. We'll do it under my care, under the radar screen. You need somebody to intervene right now and I can help you. Let me help you.",
        "Edmund: ( Laughs ) ( Cell phone rings ) Will you excuse me while I take this?",
        "Rick: Go.",
        "Edmund: Thank you. Hello?",
        "Dinah: Okay, you know what? I'm not doing this anymore. Where are you?",
        "Edmund: What?",
        "Dinah: No, no. Never mind. I'm telling Cassie about the baby, with or without you.",
        "Edmund: No, don't do that.",
        "Dinah: She may already be on to us.",
        "Edmund: No, that's just not possible. Now, listen, you have to stay the course.",
        "Dinah: Is someone there? Why are you getting all San Cristobelian on me?",
        "Edmund: You're right. Now, listen. You have to stop being so paranoid. I'll get you what you want. You just have to give me more time.",
        "Dinah: We may not have too much time. Jeffrey is here. He can smell a lie a mile away and I don't want to be here for that.",
        "Edmund: Well, you're going to have to be. Look, you've come so far and you're managing really well, and we're so close. All you have to do is remember that... ( Dial tone )",
        "Cassie: ( Laughs ) Hey.",
        "Jeffrey: Hey. You didn't touch your chili fries.",
        "Cassie: I can heat them up for you.",
        "Jeffrey: You two sit. I'll do it",
        "Cassie: Okay.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay?",
        "Dinah: Stop. Stop it. The two of you being so nice to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: So, what was the call about? \"I'll give you what you want if you give me more time\"? If I didn't know any better, it sounds to me like you've gone from using to dealing. Unless, of course, you owe somebody a lot of money. So which one is it, Edmund?",
        "Edmund: Rick, this conversation has gone from annoying to absurd. I'm a father-to-be trolling the underworld of prescription drug addiction?",
        "Rick: It's functional addiction, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: It's ridiculous, Rick. Please. Believe it or not, I'm fine. I am totally fine. I'm fine, so please let's drop this.",
        "Rick: This time. Just... just get some help, would you?",

        "Marina: Okay. ( Knocking on door ) Aw, jeez. This place is like the train station downtown.",
        "Danny: How does everyone know we're here?",
        "Marina: So much for privacy. Edmund. Are you looking for Cassie?",
        "Danny: Is something wrong?",
        "Edmund: No. Yes. Sorry to interrupt, but this must be nice, just the two of you, big hotel room and all.",

        "Danny: And you couldn't just call me?",
        "Edmund: Well, apparently not. You're going to have to forgive me. I'm just charging on all cylinders these days, waiting for the baby to come, and I think I'm a nervous wreck. I'm a bit of a crazy man. ( Laughs )",
        "Danny: You know what? Actually, I'm on my way out to pick up some dinner for us. Why don't we walk out together and we can talk about that penthouse?",

        "Marina: ...You're all worried about Edmund the Strange.",
        "Danny: Well, I'm not worried I just... I don't know. I knew him before anyone else in this town and before he got so strange. I just wish he would get his life together. Do you always know what's on my mind?",
        "Marina: Pretty amazing, huh? So tell me, what's it like to eat with a psychic?",

        "Jeffrey: What things?",
        "Dinah: Cassie, I have wanted to tell you something.",
        "Cassie: I know. I wanted to have this conversation with you alone, but I want you to know that I don't think any of this is your fault.",
        "Dinah: You'd let me off the hook?",
        "Cassie: Dinah, you're scared. You're about to have a baby, and given with everything you've gone through, this is a little bit too real for you, I'm sure.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, no. Of course.",
        "Cassie: But you know what? You're not going to have to go through this alone and you don't have to be a hero. You don't, because I am going to go through this every second with you.",

        "Cassie: I am. I'm going to be your friend. I'm going to be your partner. I'm going to be your cheerleader. We are going to do this together.",

        "Dinah: You know what, though? I don't need her help on something like this, because honest to goodness, it's going to be just a blood oath in the end. Everyone's going to hate me.",
        "Cassie: Dinah, don't say that. Everything is going to be fine.",
        "Dinah: This is a lot harder than you could possibly imagine.",
        "Jeffrey: What is?",

        "Dinah: No, I...",
        "Cassie: Yes, you do, because you're starting to get all freaked out and that's not good for you at all.",
        "Dinah: I don't need to lie down. I don't need to lie down. I don't need smiles and I don't need chili cheese fries and I don't need love. I just... I need to stop have you guys pretending that I am some saint that's going to deliver this baby.",
        "Jeffrey: Dinah, listen, we know you're not a saint. We just... Cassie appreciates what you're doing for her, that's all.",
        "Dinah: Jeffery, just stop. No. I've had enough. And there's something that I want to talk to you guys about. Something that has been difficult...",

        "Rick: Nice to see you, too. Thought I'd come by now since everybody's so busy and you are about to be busier. Look at you. Beautiful expectant mom. Oh, you know what? I just ran into Edmund recently.",
        "Dinah: Where?",
        "Rick: You know, I don't remember, but he seemed so excited about being a dad.",
        "Cassie: He is very, very excited.",
        "Dinah: Well, did he say where he was going at all?",
        "Rick: No, he didn't, but he did seem really, really stressed out to me. I mean, is it just me or does anybody else notice that he's bouncing off the walls lately?",
        "Cassie: Oh, he's always like that, but, you know, it's Dinah's stress I'm really worried about.",

        "Danny: Well, I'm not... I'm not worried exactly. Just, I don't know, he seemed all over the place. I guess it's just impending fatherhood.",
        "Marina: Well, Dinah's strong and healthy. She's got the best care. She'll be fine.",
        "Danny: Yeah. Why was he acting stranger than his usual freakiness?",

        "Jeffrey: But now you think there's more to it than that?",
        "Rick: Yes, and... ( Pager beeping ) It's the hospital. Look, this is important that we talk about it, but it's complicated so it'll take some time. Can you swing by the hospital?",
