        "Olivia: You\u2019re a mother, you\u2019re a wife, you only care about yourself. You \r\nknow, you did Josh a favor, it was about time he traded you in.",

        "Josh: What, already?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, can you get R.J. and Mrs. Chitwood. I can\u2019t believe this, we\u2019re \r\ngoing to miss our flight.",
        "Josh: You know our check out time isn\u2019t until noon.",
        "Cassie: Uh, but with\u2026",
        "Josh: We could catch a later flight.",
        "Cassie: Uh huh, yeah, I promised Tammy that I would be there for her during \r\nLizzie\u2019s hearing. Josh, come on, we knew that our coach had to turn into a \r\npumpkin sometime. Okay?",
        "Josh: You\u2019re right. Back to reality.",

        "Jonathan: Hoe, hoe, hoe, what took you so long. Lizzie and Tammy are ready at \r\nthe courtroom. ",
        "Beth: Would you move your large frame out of the way. I don\u2019t want people to \r\nsee me with you.",
        "Jonathan: If you greeted Dr. Rick like this, we wouldn't be doing this. ",
        "Beth: Do you think this is funny. ",
        "Jonathan: No, I don't think this is funny that Alan is trying to get Lizzie \r\nlocked up and take my daughter away from me. Which is why you're going to get on \r\nthe stand and say that Alan is a one-man wrecking machine. You're going to go on \r\nto sing your daughter's praises because if you don't, I'll tell everyone how you \r\nplayed lose the flower to Dr. Bauer. ",
        "Beth: I cannot testify against Alan. We both know that would be a dangerous \r\nmove. ",
        "Jonathan: Okay. I wonder if I can go to the coffee store and have one of \r\nthese blown up to poster size. ",
        "Beth: I can't testify against Alan, but I can give you this. ",
        "Jonathan: What is this? ",
        "Beth: A paper trail. Proving everything that Alan has been denying. That he \r\ndid have Lizzie followed, and he did have a prison/nursery in the house and had \r\nit dismantled before she got to the police. Uh, uh, uh. Not until you tell me I \r\ncan trust you. ",
        "Jonathan: You have my word. You ready to go do this. ",
        "Beth: You go first. ",
        "Jonathan: I live here. ",
        "Beth: I just gave you enough to place my husband on a pitard. You can't hang \r\naround here. ",
        "Jonathan: What's a pitard? ",
        "Beth: Oh, just go. ",
        "Jonathan: I love you. ",
        "Beth: Drink? I need a drink. Let's hope the baby takes after Lizzie. Oh. ",
        "Alan: Something you want to tell me? ",
        "Beth: Are you having me followed? ",
        "Alan: I don\u2019t know. Should I? ",
        "Beth: Not unless you consider visiting my daughter reason. ",
        "Alan: I don't see Elizabeth anywhere. ",
        "Beth: Yes, I thought she would be here, too, but obviously she left for the \r\ncourthouse. Speaking of which, we should get going. ",
        "Alan: Just a minute. Beth, I thought both you and I agreed Jonathan was a \r\nterrible influence on Elizabeth. Did that change? ",
        "Beth: Of course not. ",
        "Alan: Then why did I just see him leaving here with an idiotic grin on his \r\nface? ",
        "Beth: Because I paid him. ",

        "Mel: You guys can come in now. ",
        "Lizzie: Oh, I'm so glad you guys are here. Is everything taken care of? ",
        "Mel: I don't like the sound of that. What is going on. We can't afford any \r\nsurprises, Jonathan. ",
        "Jonathan: Let's just say Beth isn't as tight with Alan as everybody thought.\r\n",
        "Mel: Did Beth tell you she is on Lizzie\u2019s side? ",
        "Jonathan: Beth is going to do the right thing for everybody. Us, you, the \r\nbaby. ",
        "Mel: Me? ",
        "Mel: Jonathan, wait. ",
        "Jonathan: This is a closed courtroom. ",
        "Cassie: I am here to support my daughter. ",
        "Jonathan: You're not welcome here. ",
        "Josh: Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Go find your wife, Josh.",
        "Cassie: Josh isn\u2019t leaving either.",
        "Jonathan: Well if the only way to support her is to be here with him, then \r\nyou are not welcome either. Get out.",
        "Tammy: Okay, come on, let\u2019s go.",
        "Jonathan: No, Tammy, they need to know that today isn\u2019t about them, it\u2019s \r\nabout my kid. Lizzie is going to be on a hot seat, and we have to prove to a \r\njudge we can be good parents, and having your mom who is going after her \r\nsister's husband isn't exactly going to help us with the family values, so\u2026",
        "Cassie: Who the hell do you think you are? How dare you-- ",
        "Josh: It's not worth it. Okay? Any other day, you and I would be having words \r\noutside right now. But in this particular case, you happen to be right. Today is \r\nabout the welfare of your child, and she needs all of the help she can get. ",
        "Cassie: Josh... Josh, you don't have to go just because Jonathan wants you \r\nto. ",
        "Josh: It's okay. I'll go. You stay here for Tammy, okay. ",
        "Cassie: Honey, you know that I did not want this-- ",
        "Tammy: I know, Mom. ",
        "Cassie: But I'm here now. So tell me what I can do for you. ",
        "Tammy: Go after him. ",
        "Cassie: What? No. Honey, I promised-- ",
        "Tammy: Mom, if the situation were switched around and Jonathan were the one \r\nwalking out, I wouldn't be here. Believe me, I know how it feels. You picked the \r\neasy guy to love. You have to go fix it now. I'll call you if I need you, I \r\npromise. ",
        "Jonathan: I'm sorry. ",
        "Tammy: Why are you fighting Reva\u2019s battles. I don't get it. ",
        "Jonathan: I don't get why you think it is okay for your mom to go after Josh.\r\n",
        "Tammy: Maybe it's crazy, but, you know what, I see us in them. ",
        "Jonathan: Don't say that. ",
        "Tammy: I didn't like it at first either, but I want my mom to be happy, \r\nJonathan, and Josh makes her happy. I know you just want to protect your mom, \r\nbut you know she can stand up for herself. In fact, the Reva I know will \r\nprobably insist upon it. ",
        "Jonathan: Yes, but Reva is obviously not here right now. ",
        "Tammy: By her own choice. Which is exactly what started this whole thing \r\nbecause my mom and Uncle Josh, anyway. Why are you still defending Reva? What \r\ndon't I know? ",
        "",
        "Billy: Hey, I thought this was-- what are you doing with an I.V.? ",
        "Reva: It's just fluids. ",
        "Billy: Okay. So what did Josh say? Reva! Wait, wait, wait, you didn't tell \r\nhim? ",
        "Reva: I wanted to. I went to New York, I was going to tell him right after \r\nthe ceremony, and then I saw something. ",
        "Billy: What-- you didn't see-- ",
        "Reva: No, no, no. In a way, that would have made it a whole lot easier. No. \r\nWhat I saw in New York wasn't a cheating husband or a back- stabbing sister. I \r\nsaw a family. I saw Joshua and Cassie and R.J. together. ",
        "Billy: Reva. ",
        "Reva: And it wasn't even just the way they were with R.J., it was the way \r\nthey were with each other. This is the biggest moment in Joshua\u2019s life and he \r\nwanted Cassie there with him. Not just as a substitute for me, but because he \r\nneeded her, and she needed him, too. That connection that Josh told me about, I \r\nsaw it. It was there. ",
        "Billy: I'm so sorry. ",
        "Reva: Well, seeing them like that together... it hurt like nothing I've ever \r\nfelt before, but it doesn't psych me up, you know. It wore me out. ",
        "Billy: Well, that's not Reva. ",
        "Reva: Well, I know. You think you're confused. I'm confused. ",
        "Billy: Yeah. ",
        "Nurse: You're going to have to rest before you can go home. ",
        "Reva: I know. ",
        "Nurse: Do you have any questions about hospice, Mrs. Lewis? ",
        "Billy: She doesn't have to give you that stuff right now. Thank you. ",
        "Reva: Billy, don't take it out on the nurse. ",
        "Billy: I'm not. ",
        "Reva: Can you do me a favor? Can you see if you can go find that doctor that \r\ntook over for Colin. I've got to talk. ",
        "Billy: See you later. ",
        "",
        "Jonathan: Reva is my mom and I just think it's messed up, her and Cassie \r\nwanting the same guy. ",
        "Tammy: How do you know Reva even wants to be with Josh anymore? I feel bad \r\nfor her, but she is the one who just picked up and left. ",
        "Lizzie: Tammy, the press is here, you have to help me. They're going to try \r\nto trick me into saying something. ",
        "Jonathan: You didn't have to do that. ",
        "Tammy: There were reporters. ",
        "Jonathan: I know why you came when I did and I wish that I could tell her \r\nabout Reva\u2019s cancer but I can't because then she is to keep it with her mom. ",
        "Lizzie: What is the deal with Cassie and Josh? ",
        "Jonathan: Don't get me started. Have you ever seen two people who do not \r\nbelong together but blind to it? ",
        "Lizzie: Uh, yeah, yeah. ",
        "Jonathan: Anyway, thank you for the help. ",
        "Lizzie: I did it for us. Me and the baby. I mean, I kind of owe you one for \r\nprotecting me from granddad. I know it, it's cost you. ",

        "Alan: Now, we've both given him money, but I don't think this situation is \r\ngoing to be resolved by bribery. ",
        "Beth: This time is different. I gave him money to stick around to make things \r\nmuch worse for Lizzie at the hearing. ",
        "Alan: So if I call the bank, I'll see there is a large withdrawal from our \r\nbank account, is that it? ",
        "Beth: No. I have cash for emergencies. Any wife worth her salt has a little \r\ncash fund. ",
        "Alan: I taught you well. ",
        "Beth: I learned from the best, darling. We should go. ",

        "Alan: I don't think so. I think you would be a liability and a risk. Why \r\ndon't you stay and work on your story about Jonathan Randall. And if you're \r\ngoing to lie to me, lie to me with conviction, you hear. ",

(Laughs) Note to self: Let daughter know that your \r\nfavorite flowers are yellow roses. Is that what happens when you're near the \r\nend, Momma? When your mind starts getting full of all the millions of little \r\nthings you want to do before... you know I'm not here just for a visit. I'm \r\ndying and I'm not ready. I need your help, Momma.

One that my client had hoped to avoid, but Mr. Spaulding\u2019s \r\nfear for the mental health of his granddaughter and her unborn child is why \r\nwe're here today. We will prove to the court that Elizabeth Spaulding\u2019s fragile \r\nmental state has led to delusions and acts of violence, including the shooting \r\nof her own grandfather, and for these reasons, we petition the court to place \r\nher in the custody of Alan Spaulding indefinitely.

        "Reva: So here's the deal. The thing is, is that I'm the sick person, so \r\ndoesn't it make sense that I can be selfish now? That I can want Joshua there to \r\ncomfort me when things are getting really bad because my doctor and even my own \r\nbody is telling me that, that time is soon. Oh, boy, never in a million years \r\never would have thought that Josh and Cassie would have fallen for each other \r\nwhen I was away doing my stem cell thing or my bone marrow thing or my fighting \r\nfor my life thing! I know you told me that I was supposed to look out for my \r\nsister, and I took vows to Josh that I would always take care of him. Three \r\ntimes over I did that. But I don't think that's what the big guy up there had in \r\nmind. Yeah, I am. I'm talking to you again! I tried to do the right thing. I \r\nprotected them. I was being unselfish for a change and look where it got me. So \r\nscrew you. I know. (Laughs) I know, Momma. I better watch who I mouth off to, \r\nhuh? I think Joshua got me a bouquet like this for one of our first \r\nanniversaries. I thought I was going to have 50 more of them back then. I wonder \r\nif I would have done anything differently if I'd known that I was... no, \r\nprobably not. It's not that Cassie\u2019s a bad person. She's not, she's good. And \r\nyou gave her that. She's good, she's kind and she's fun. She's had such a rough \r\ngo of things and she deserves someone who's... just like Joshua. You know, I'd \r\nreally prefer a mixed drink over a mixed blessing any time. Because if that's \r\nwhat this is, maybe it's a good thing I didn't tell Josh after all, because now \r\nat least he's had the chance to follow the dreams that he had to put aside to \r\nalways be there to take care of me all those years. I'll never stop loving him. \r\nMomma, do you remember what you told me about doing the right thing? You said to \r\nfigure out what the easy choice was and then pick the other one. ",

        "Marni: Permission to call one final witness. ",
        "Mel: Your honor.... ",
        "Judge: I'll allow it. ",
        "Marni: We call Tammy Winslow to the stand. ",
        "Judge: Miss Winslow, please take the stand. ",
        "Jonathan: Can't you object or something? ",
        "Tammy: Why does she even want to talk to me? ",
        "Mel: Just answer her questions. ",
        "Judge: Miss Winslow. ",
        "Marni: Miss Winslow, you're part of the threesome involving Elizabeth \r\nSpaulding and her baby's father Jonathan Randall. ",
        "Tammy: Jonathan and I invited Lizzie to live with us if that's what you mean. \r\nWe're going to raise the baby together. ",
        "Marni: Would you say you're the most stable member of this trio? ",
        "Tammy: Jonathan and Lizzie are going to make great parents. ",
        "Marni: But, is it fair to say you're the one holding the moral compass? ",
        "Mel: Your honor, where is this going? ",
        "Judge: Miss Sharp? ",
        "Marni: It goes to the witness's criminal credibility. How can a person who \r\nwas aware of Miss Spaulding\u2019s criminal intentions but didn't tell the \r\nauthorities be fit to raise this child. ",
        "Jonathan: What the hell is she talking about? Can't you make her stop? ",
        "Tammy: I don't know what you mean. ",
        "Sharp: Immediately following Alan Spaulding\u2019s shooting, did you and Miss \r\nSpaulding having a conversation in the hospital? ",
        "Tammy: Yes. ",
        "Marni: I'd like to to enter into evidence a sworn deposition signed by two \r\nnurses employed by Cedars, who overheard Miss Winslow and Miss Spaulding\u2019s \r\nconversation. Perhaps you can read it outloud. Start there on line 21. Your \r\nline. ",
        "Tammy: She told Miss Spaulding \"You just tell them the truth, you thought you \r\nwere shooting an intruder.\" ",
        "Marni: Skip down to Lizzie\u2019s answer. ",
        "Tammy: Miss Spaulding said \"But I knew, Tammy. I knew it was my granddad, \r\nthat's why I shot him.\" ",

        "Josh: You... you don't have to leave right this minute. (Laughs) ",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I think this is already the longest good-bye in history. If I \r\nstay, I'm just going to want to keep kissing you so I have to go. I have to go.\r\n",
        "Josh: I had a lot more I wanted to say to you. I figured we would have more \r\ntime. ",

        "Reva: I've had great loves. And amazing kids. And a really good life. But all \r\ngood things must... ",

        "Reva: But I need one more thing. ",
        "Billy: Just name it, you got it. ",
        "Reva: Start letting go. ",
        "Billy: No, no. Can't do that. ",
        "Reva: Billy... ",

        "Reva: I don't want to, either. But it's just going to be harder if I'm trying \r\nto let go and you're still holding on. I need to stop fighting what I can't beat \r\nand I need to spend what time I have left making things right for after I'm \r\ngone. ",
        "Billy: I don't understand. ",
        "Reva: I don't want Josh to ever know I was sick. ",

        "Marni: The way I see it there are only two logical explanations, either \r\nLizzie is mentally unstable or she's an attempted murderer. Which is it? ",
