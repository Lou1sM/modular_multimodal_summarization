If you stick around long enough, we might all get lucky.", "Jeffrey: Yeah, I don't trust mother nature anymore than I do human nature. Take you for example. One minute you own a house, next minute it belongs to your cousin tony. It doesn't bother you.", "Danny: He paid cash. Here you go. Hey, you. Can I join you? What was that for?", "Michelle: That was for that little light house and the building permit.", "Danny: Oh, yeah. Oh, that, yeah.", "Michelle: You made it happen, danny.", "Danny: Well...", "Michelle: And now tony and i can get ready to get our renovation started.", "Danny: Good. I'm glad. Because you know I've been doing a little renovating myself.", "Michelle: Yeah?", "Danny: Yes, I have. When I handed the deed of my house over to tony, I kind of realized I don't need my house. I don't need my car. I don't need my suits. I don't need my watch. I don't need my cell phone or my wallets or the shoes on my feet. I don't need anything at all. Except you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: Granddad, please tell me who the winner of the contest is.", "Alan: Now listen...", "Lizzie: Excuse me? Can we help you?", "Coop: Yeah, I'm looking for the coopers. Harley, frank, marina. You know them?", "Alan: You may want to try across the street at the hospital. I'm sure they're there wit their father buzz. I assume you heard about buzz.", "Coop: Yeah, that's why I'm here.", "Lizzie: Well, wasn't he a rude one. Now listen, okay, back to the contest. I will let you vote on my shares until I'm 30. You've just got to tell me who the winner is, please? Until I'm 40.", "Alan: Elizabeth, you will find out who the winner tonight is at dinner. And that is final.", "Lizzie: Well, will you at least tell me who the finalist are? You don't trust me?", "Alan: Of course I trust you, darling. But look, I will tell you this. Tammy's in the lead and joseph's in second.", "Lizzie: No. Granddad, joey can't be in second. He's got to win.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: I've got water, soda, fruit juice and tea. So what can I get for you?", "Steve: How about another driver?", "Joey: Sorry. The road gets better up ahead.", "Tammy: Maybe we should take the highway?", "Joey: No, no. The highway is too much traffic. So you must be tired, huh? Long flight?", "Steve: Yeah, well, I'm waking up pretty quickly back here.", "Joey: Here. Some tunes to get you to the awards dinner.", "Tammy: Oh, no, no, no. This is much better. Simulated surround sound.", "Joey: Digital is as good as gets.", "Tammy: Soprano sound track. Uncle junior sings.", "Steve: Yeah, so I heard.", "Joey: Yeah, which is probably why you want my downloads.", "Tammy: So what do you want to listen to?", "Steve: I want both of you to shut up.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Buzz: Why is everything in plastic cups?", "Harley: Because they're trying to measure how much food you eat.", "Buzz: I wouldn't feed this to the stray behind company.", "Harley: Please, dad, just take one bite.", "Buzz: Really. You first.", "Harley: He's back.", "Buzz: It wouldn't be so funny if you were waiting for the mack truck they call-- oh, god.", "Nurse: Visiting hours are over.", "Marina: My grandpa needs to be with his family.", "Buzz: I might be dead come daybreak.", "Nurse: Make sure he's stays calm. No excitement.", "Harley: Would you stop? You're not going anywhere. You had your chance to die and you blew it. As a matter of fact when you get out of here, you are doing hard time at my place with me and frank and marina and the boys. So get used to it.", "Marina: (Laughs)", "Buzz: I'll do it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: Hello, people. How's the patient?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: O'neill?", "Cassie: How would you like to come over for dinner?", "Jeffrey: Hello? What? Just the two of us?", "Cassie: Well, no, silly. Rj and edmund will be here too. Will's camping out with jude and tammy had a special dinner tonight. So edmund suggested that we invite you over. It'll be fun.", "Jeffrey: Oh, yeah, that'll be a regular riot.", "Cassie: Come on, jeffrey. Edmund's trying to make-up for being so suspicious. And he wants to thank you for putting away the identity thieves.", "Jeffrey: Oh, really?", "Cassie: Set another place for dinner.", "Jeffrey: Cassie?", "Cassie: It's a done deal, o'neL. I'm going to guess that you like steak and potatoes? Hmm? (Laughs) okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Well, we need more silverware.", "Rj: For who?", "Edmund: Mommy's friend.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: My father needs to stay calm. He can't afford to become anxious.", "Harley: You're the one who's anxious.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: I just wanted to bring him bait and tackle magazine. It's got the streams in north america.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Buzz: Fishing. Since when do I fish?", "Marina: Thanks. See you later.", "Buzz: Hey, what's the rush?", "Marina: The doctors said that we had to keep visitors to a minimum. Family members only.", "Buzz: Well, gus is family members. Isn't he?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Whatever you want, dad.", "Buzz: Well, I want you two to get over the past. If you were lying here like me, would it matter that much or would you just love him anyway?", "Harley: The man is obviously heavily medicated.", "Gus: Look you need your rest. I'm going to... I just wanted to... I'll stop by tomorrow.", "Buzz: You let him walk away, I'm going to cut you out of the will.", "Harley: All right, all right. Don't get cranky. I'll get him. And what will? You're hardly trump, you know.", "Buzz: Get him back here.", "Harley: Thanks for coming. It means a lot to him. My dad.", "Gus: Well, he's a great guy.", "Harley: You know why this is so hard? It's hard because I want you here, okay. I need you here. I don't want you to go. But I can't let you stay.", "Gus: I understand.", "Harley: I know you understand. You're the only who does understand. That's why it hurts because you weren't just the man I was going to marry. You were my best friend.", "Gus: And I'm still am.", "Harley: You're not. You're one of them. You're a spaulding.", "Gus: Look, I wasn't going to tell you this, okay. But the night of your father's surgery...", "Coop: Is that harley cooper, the ugly one in the family?", "Harley: Oh, my god!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steve: Hey, once you get it started, can you go back? I think you've missed a couple of pot holes. You know,, I want to bite my tongue a couple more times.", "Tammy: I told you we should have taken the highway.", "Joey: Sorry. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What did you guys want me to do? Hit the tree that was in the middle of the road?", "Steve: At least it would have ended our misery.", "Tammy: Can you believe this? We could be at that awards dinner right now making all kinds of points with alan spaulding, but no. Instead we're here.", "Steve: You're flooding the engine, lupo.", "Tammy: Oh, like it'll do any good to tell him? He does whatever he wants no matter who gets hurt.", "Steve: Yeah, well, guys are pigs sometimes, you know. Now can we get moving?", "Joey: I wasn't trying to hurt anybody. Steve, will tell her I was never trying to hurt her.", "Steve: He wasn't trying to hurt you.", "Tammy: So I suppose lizzie doesn't matter then?", "Steve: Lizzie? Who's lizzie?", "Joey: She's a friend.", "Steve: Lupo, there's friends and there's friends.", "Joey: She's a friend friend.", "Steve: He says she's just a friend.", "Tammy: Then why does he hang out with her all the time?", "Steve: Lupo?", "Joey: Because, well...", "Tammy: Why can't you just admit it that you like her.", "Joey: I do like her. But not like how I like you.\u00e9@", "Tammy: You don't know what you want. Maybe it's whoever's handy.", "Joey: You see what I'm talking about? The moment I start telling her the truth she starts freaking out.", "Tammy: I am not freaking out.", "Joey: You are too freaking out. Tammy, what do you want? What do you want from me?", "Steve: Lupo, for god's sakes just give her a kiss so we could get out of here.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: Well, elizabeth, you really care about this joseph, don't you?", "Lizzie: More than anyone I've met before. Like he's probably the only guy that treats like I'm not a spaulding.", "Alan: And that's a good thing?", "Lizzie: Well, you know what i mean. It's not easy having money and being special. Everybody resents you. And I don't know. He sees me. Likes me for me and what's inside. And I really love him for that.", "Alan: Well, let's not go overboard with this.", "Lizzie: You don't understand, granddad. He's got to win, okay. He's smart, he's special. He just deserves to be with us.", "Alan: And if joseph should win?", "Lizzie: Then he'll see that we're not any different and we can date for real.", "Alan: What about tammy?", "Lizzie: I sort think that tammy's kind of habit for him. And honestly I think she's holding him back.", "Alan: No, I wasn't referring to that. But doesn't bother you that she deserves to win?", "Lizzie: No, because joey deserves it a lot more.", "Alan: You are a spaulding, young lady. You're already pulling a few strings.", "Lizzie: So is joey in?", "Alan: You will find out tonight at the dinner. Now I've got to go and make some phone calls, but whatever happens, you will get what you want. You always do, young lady.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie/alan: (Laughs)", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: So I thought you'd be really down, you know, after having to sell your house to tony.", "Danny: Yeah, well, I was. I was down. But then I realized that my dream for us doesn't involve houses or things. It's about you and me and robbie being together and sharing our life together. So I spent the last few days selling off the rest of the 5th street.", "Michelle: You're not serious.", "Danny: Yeah, I cashed out. I'm dead free. (Laughs)", "Michelle: Well, how much did you have left after you paid off your debt?", "Danny: Um...", "Michelle: No. You lost everything?", "Danny: Mm-hmm. Yep. Worse than that.", "Michelle: Wow.", "Danny: Well, my cousin ray would say that it will either break my spirit or set me free. But I don't know. Right now I'm feeling strangely bird like. You want to fly with me?", "Michelle: Where to?", "Danny: I n't know. Anywhere. We'll just pick a spot and go.", "Michelle: You're so different right now.", "Danny: Different. How? Good different? Bad different? What was that for?", "Michelle: Following me. I just can't seem to find my way back. But you came after me, didn't you?", "Danny: Now we both lost.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tony: No, no, I haven't seen the changes yet. But I will... well, we'll let you know what we think, all right? Okay. I'll call you back.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: Hey, tony. You want something?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Everything all right?", "Cassie: Oh, yeah, yeah. I just... storm's coming.", "Edmund: Casie, about the hotel convention. I hope it was everything you wanted it to be.", "Cassie: Actually it was. Edmund, look about the trip. I... you're here.", "Jeffrey: I must have been crazy trying to drive out in this weather. If that road floods, I'll never make it back. I hope you've got an extra room for me.", "Cassie: There's always the barn.", "Jeffrey: Oh, there it is again. That great hospitality of yours.", "Edmund: Oh, don't worry, mr. O'neill, we won't turn you out in the storm. You're more than welcome to stay here. After all you did save cassie from the terrible imposture and accomplices. I for one couldn't thank you enough.", "Jeffrey: (Laughs)", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: I can't believe this. Daddy's going to light up when he sees you.", "Coop: Really?", "Harley: Yes.", "Coop: Wait a minute. Whoa! What took you guys so long to let me know that he was in the hospital.", "Harley: Oh, please, you know dad and frank. They think you're five. They're still trying to protect you. When did you get so tall? Look at you. And you're beautiful.", "Coop: Stop. Bradshaw eyes. Yeah, I know. You say the exact same thing every time.", "Harley: Oh.", "Coop: Then comes the questions, how's your brother doing?", "Harley: How's your brother doing?", "Coop: And how's the family doing?", "Harley: How's the family?", "Coop: And then all of a sudden ...", "Marina: Mind your own bloody business. (Laughs)", "Coop: Oh, my god.", "Marina: Hi. When did you get here?", "Coop: About an hour or so ago.", "Marina: Well, it's about time, unc.", "Coop: Why? Did something happen to dad? If so I need to call rocky back in london.", "Harley: No, no, no. That's not what she meant. No, no. He's good. The angioplasty went very well. He just needs some recovery. He is on the mend though. Definitely.", "Marina: Oh, for sure. He is bossing everyone around and complaining about everything.", "Coop: Look when can I see him? Where is he?", "Gus: He's inside. I'm sure he'd be glad to see you. Whoever you are.", "Harley: This is henry copper bradshaw. My brother. And this is gus aitoro.", "Gus: Yes, I've heard of you.", "Coop: Yeah, you, too.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: I don't want you to kiss me.", "Joey: Does it look like I'm trying?", "Tammy: He can kiss my you know what when I win the spaulding internship.", "Joey: Keep dreaming, winslow.", "Tammy: Joey, how could you say something like that?", "Steve: You know excuse me a second. You know, I don't pretend to be a genius, but I can't figure out why you two aren't together. Because you're sure fighting like people that want to be.", "Joey: Hello?", "Lizzie: Hey, it's me. I'm back from new york and i can't wait to see you. Going to meet me at company?", "Joey: When?", "Lizzie: Well now. I thought maybe we could ride over to the dinner together. I have a feeling you're in for a big night.", "Tammy: Let me guess. Lizzie? And you were wondering what keeps us apart?", "Lizzie: Was that tammy?", "Joey: Yeah, tammy and i picked up steve schirippa, you know, the guy who plays bobby on the sopranos...", "Lizzie: I love that guy.", "Joey: Yeah, well, wed were in the car on our way to dinner and a tree feel in the middle of jefferson road and now we're stuck on the side of the road. All three of us.", "Lizzie: Well, say no more. I'll be right there.", "Joey: No, no, no, no. It's okay, lizzie. Look I think I just flooded the engine. I'm going to try to get the car back started and we'll all meet you at the dinner, okay? Lizzie?", "Lizzie: Okay.", "Steve: Did you ask lizzie to send the rescue party?", "Joey: No, I told her not to worry about it.Ok", "Tammy: Then what's that?", "Steve: That would be...", "Tammy/joey: Yours?", "Steve: I wish the both of you a lot of luck. And I hope to never see the one of you ever again. I got to get out of here.", "Joey: Whoa, what about the awards dinner?", "Tammy: We need you.", "Joey: Please.", "Steve: No. You guys don't need me. You need each other. You know, if you're smart you'll sit there until you could figure that out. Lupo, wisen up, would you?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tony: It's not that big a deal, but the architect made some changes on the blueprints. So... do you know what? Listen. Wait. I'm going to order some take- out. So I will see you guys later.", "Michelle: Wait, tony. Hang on. Sit in a seat.", "Danny: Come on, man, sit down. Have a drink. You don't want to go back out in that storm, do you?", "Tony: Well, I like the storms. It's the sunny days that make me nervous.", "Michelle: Can't take the heat?", "Tony: Yeah, that's right. I'll see you guys.", "Michelle: Always the loner.", "Danny: He likes it that way.", "Michelle: I guess so.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: Hi, tony. So you're just hanging out here tonight?", "Tony: What's up, lizzie?", "Lizzie: I was kind of hoping that we could do a little business.", "Tony: Really?", "Lizzie: Okay. See there's this party I'm going to with this guy and it just so happens he's a little on the shy side, and I was kind of hoping maybe you had something that would open him up.", "Tony: Lizzie, you're asking me for drugs?", "Lizzie: Or something that will do the same thing maybe?", "Tony: Do me a favor and get out of here.", "Lizzie: But you have to know somebody who could...", "Tony: I said get out of here before I call your mother and your father. Boo.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Here let me take that for you. Rj, knife sharp.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rj: Mommy!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: It's okay.", "Edmund: Don't worry, rj, lightning wouldn't dare strike the farm not with the hero of the hour present.", "Jeffrey: I was just doing my job, edmund.", "Edmund: Oh, don't be modest, mr. O'neill. Thanks to you this family never has to live in fear again or spend another night apart as we did last night.", "Jeffrey: Okay. I think I want to clear the dishes.", "Edmund: All right. Thank you.", "Cassie: I'll help.", "Jeffrey: So what's with eddie? He seems like he'S...", "Cassie: Nice. Nice. He's trying to makeup for giving you such a hard time earlier.", "Jeffrey: Oh, nice. That must be...", "Cassie: He was so suspicious before, okay. You know tonight is a step towards our lives getting back to normal.", "Dinah: All I know is that his time in san cristobal, it changed him playing richard. And it was more than a job. It became an obsession.", "Edmund: And so did cassie. Cassie?", "Cassie: Whoa. All right, rj, you stay there. You stay with edmund. I'm going to get a flashlight, okay.", "Jeffrey: Why don't you let me lead the way?", "Cassie: Oh, how would you know...", "Jeffrey: (Laughs)", "Cassie: ...Where you're going to? Coming up on \"guiding light.\"", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: Oh, and I love danger, tony and so do you.", "Tony: Okay, I do only when it's worth taking the risk. What are you doing?", "Michelle: What would you risk everything to have, huh? Tell me. What? Tell me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rj: She's here. She's here.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: I certainly hope that was a nervous twitch of yours or something.", "Coop: Listen I know all about you, aitoro. And what you did to my sister harley. Ruining frank's career. And now my dad. Believe me, one hit is barely a start.", "Cooper: Okay, stop it, please. Dad is barely out of surgery.", "Coop: Then what's he doing here?", "Gus: I'm here because he wants me here, okay. And if you had half the class that he has...", "Coop: Oh, class. Class. Just because you're a spaulding, you think you got all this class and clout like you can come and go as you please and do whatever you want to do.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: Wait, wait, wait. What's going on here?", "Gus: Nothing.", "Alan: You again, huh?", "Coop: Yeah, who are you?", "Marina: Alan spaulding. You've got another fist for him?", "Harley: No one is punching anybody. Stop.", "Alan: What happened?", "Gus: It's okay.", "Harley: My brother hit him.", "Coop: Yeah, not hard enough.", "Alan: Your brother, huh? Well, I'm calling security.", "Harley: No.", "Gus: No, it's fine. Look. It's fine. It's a misunderstanding. Just let it go all right.", "Marina: Come on, let's go get some ice for hand and then we'll go see him.", "Gus: What... what are you doing here?", "Alan: I've come to see buzz.", "Harley: Oh, great. That what my father needs. A visit from the angel of death.", "Alan: Look, at times like this harley you put aside petty difference. I care enough about your father to pay him a visit.", "Harley: You care enough to visit, but you don't care enough to save the restaurant?", "Alan: This is not the time or place for that conversation.", "Harley: Fine. You can go in. But if you rile him up, I will be the one to call to security. Does it hurt? Good.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: One-100. Two-100.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy/joey: Three-100. Four.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: It's close.", "Joey: Don't worry.", "Tammy: I'm not.", "Joey: Tammy, I'm sorry.", "Tammy: I'm sorry that I was such a jerk, joey.", "Joey: It's okay.", "Tammy: I don't even care about that stupid contest. In fact, I hope you win.", "Joey: Thanks. I hope I win, too. I mean I need to win it.", "Tammy: I know.", "Joey: But it wouldn't hurt if you win, also.", "Tammy: I've been so unfair to you. I really have. I mean I blamed you for being with lizzie and not like we were even together anymore. I didn't have a right to do that.", "Joey: No, you did. You know, I was just mad because I thought I could never be the guy you wanted me to be.", "Tammy: You are, joey. You always have been. I've always liked you. Even when I was sure that you didn't like me.", "Joey: No, tammy, I never stopped.", "Tammy: But lizzie...", "Joey: Lizzie... lizzie. Lizzie. Lizzie's just a good friend. You know, she's someone who's believed in my music and me and well, I like her, just not the way that she wants me to like her.", "Lizzie: Does she know that?", "Joey: No, and it's my fault that she know that. You know, I could have been a lot more honest with her, but i never told her there's one person I love and care about. And it's you.", "Tammy: Joey, I have been waiting forever to hear you say that.", "Joey: Tammy, I feel so stupid. I mean it took steve to get into the back seat of car to let us know that we were meant for each other.", "Tammy: Maybe it takes a stranger to see what we couldn't see. It's a beautiful night, isn't it?", "Joey: Sure is.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jb: Hey, there.", "Lizzie: Hello.", "Jb: I heard you asked about some party snacks... the kind that make a guy loosen up?", "Lizzie: And you have those?", "Jb: 200 bucks.", "Lizzie: What? They're that expensive.", "Jb: 300.", "Lizzie: Okay, 200 in cash. Wait, wait, wait. There aren't any side effects to this is there?

It's amazing.", "Tony: You have lost your mind.", "Michelle: Mm-hmm.", "Tony: Yeah.", "Michelle: Look at the sky. Check them out. You could feel the thunder.", "Tony: Yeah, well, you know what? You will feel it if you do get struck by lightning. So let's go inside.", "Michelle: I ain't afraid of no storms. Come on, tony, dance with me. Dance with me.", "Tony: No, I don't have... you're crazy. You've lost your mind.", "Michelle: Yes, I have.", "Tony: Can we go inside?", "Michelle: I have lost my mind. I don't know who I am. I don't know what I am. I don't know where I am. And it is amazing. Come on.", "Tony: (Laughs)", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: Double reds.", "Jeffrey: What does that mean?", "Cassie: It means you move twice on red. (Laughs)", "Edmund: Power lines are dead.", "Cassie: Oh, well, you know there's an old generator in the barn, but I don't know how to get it started. So...", "Jeffrey: Well, I'll give it a try. Okay.", "Rj: Isn't jeffrey scared?", "Cassie: Jeffrey's very brave. Just like edmund.", "Edmund: I'll see if he needs any help.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: Come on, tony. Come and get me. Come and get me. I dare you.", "Tony: Will you get down, please?", "Michelle: Come on, what are you waiting for a meteor shower?", "Tony: It's getting dangerous. Come on, let's go inside.", "Michelle: Oh, I love danger, tony. And so do you.", "Tony: Okay, I do only when it's worth taking the risk. Now come on, let's go. Please.

I don't want to dance.", "Michelle: Just one dance and I'll go inside. One.", "Tony: No, no, no.", "Danny: Oh, please.", "Michelle: Oh, your cousin's a wimp. He's scared of storms.", "Tony: Oh, I'm wimp. I'm wimp because I...", "Danny: Well, maybe...", "Tony: Right.", "Danny: ...He just doesn't want to get killed.", "Tony: Thank you.", "Michelle: All right fine. You guys go inside. I'll dance alone.", "Danny: No you won'T.", "Michelle: Oh, yeah? You just try and stop, man.", "Danny: No you won'T. Hey.", "Michelle: Whew.", "Danny: Who said anything about stopping you?", "Michelle: Yeah?", "Danny: Hmm?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: Don't stop.", "Joey: Tammy?", "Tammy: It feels so right.", "Joey: Tammy, tammy, tammy.", "Tammy: Don't stop. We both know that it's right.", "Joey: You mean...", "Tammy: Yes. I want to. I love you, joey, and I want to. And not just because I want to get back at lizzie or hold on to you, but because of the way i feel when we're together.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: Hey, I bet you're glad to see me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: Now will you just save the act? You don't have to put on a show for me. You forget that I am a heart attack survivor myself.", "Buzz: Did you see your life flash before you? Think of things maybe you should have done differently, al?", "Alan: Yes, yes. And I realized I made a lot of mistakes.", "Buzz: Well, then keep phillip from making a huge one.", "Alan: Buzz, what you and i have survived the past year, i feel I have to be honest with you. You're right. I could intervene for you with but remember like you my family and my family's legacy means everything to me. I have been preparing phillip all of his life to lead. I must let him do what he feels is right.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: Look, this was a mistake, you know. I mean I came to your father, but every time I do I end up seeing you and I...", "Harley: Yes, I know.", "Gus: That's it? That's all you could say to me? Yeah, I know?", "Alan: Your father seems to be doing very well. Gus, I need a lift home.", "Gus: Sure.", "Harley: Gus, you were going to tell me something before coop arrived. There was something you wanted to tell me that happened during my dad's surgery?", "Gus: It doesn't really matter anymore. F*", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: You know what? Nothing to worry about. I bet it's just those pesky pirates again.", "Rj: Pirates?", "Cassie: Pirates shooting canon balls. (Laughs)", "Rj: Are they bad pirates?", "Cassie: No, no, they're good pirates. You know what they do? They search the world for kids in trouble and they rescue them and they keep them safe.", "Rj: Like my imaginary friend.", "Cassie: Just like your imaginary friend.", "Rj: She's here. She's here.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: Oh, come on. Give. Edmund, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be with cassie? I mean can't you keep her safe or happy or satisfied for five minutes? You're making it so easy, man. I mean you're practically pushing cassie into my arms. I mean not that she needs much of a push. You know what I mean? From the moment she saw my face, richard's face, she's been crazy for me hasn't she? Of course she felt sorry for you, so she hasn't told about her true feelings for me. But it's better this way, isn't it? It's better for everyone this way. That we all know that it's all out in the open. Cassie and I... well, edmund, we're lovers.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marina: Hey, grandpa.", "Buzz: Hey.", "Marina: We have a little surprise for you.", "Buzz: I must be dying.", "Coop: That's not what i heard, dad.
