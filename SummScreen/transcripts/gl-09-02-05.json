The truth I'm not. \nCassie: The monster that i always thought you were? I know that. I know there's no way you could carry a baby around for nine months and not become a little more human. \nDinah: That's not what I'm talking about. \nCassie: And I know what it's like to be so emotional right before you deliver a baby. Dinah, when I had tammy, i was... ( gasp ) I was terrified. I was totally and completely freaked out. But you know what? It's normal. \nDinah: There's nothing normal about this. I am sick of pretending to be your self sacrificing gestational carrier! I am in this for the payback! Pure and simple. \nCassie: I know. \nDinah: What? \nCassie: I know you want to pay me back for all the horrible things you did to me. I understand. I'm just trying to tell you... \nDinah: You're not.

She's being shy about this because she doesn't want you to hear.

Don't be so damn noble. \nReva: I won't let josh believe I have some serious injury when I don'T. \nJonathan: Oh, yeah, she's fine. \nReva: Just a few minor back spasms. \nJosh: Reva, look, if you're not feeling well, maybe you should just stay here for a little longer. \nJonathan: The doctor said that if the worst is going to happen, it could happen anywhere. \nJosh: Okay, you know what?

And you're doing that by bringing my baby into the world. \nDinah: In the beginning that's what it was about. I said that, you know, something changed that and that changed the whole plan not long after i got pregnant. \nCassie: You and edmund became lovers. I know about it. I guess it was bound to happen. You are carrying his baby. \nDinah: Yeah. Yes, I am. But now... \nCassie: Now you're going to get married. \nDinah: No, no. \nCassie: Just be careful. Please, please be careful.

It does.\nDinah: It already has. That's what I'm trying to tell you. \nCassie: Well, then you've got to be careful. And you've got to... you got to stay away from him for awhile, okay. Listen to me. My gut is telling me that after this baby is born he's going to forget that you're even alive, okay. Yes, he's is going to be so absorbed with being a daddy. I'm telling you. \nDinah: No, he's not.

I have tried to convince him to just take me away, just run off. \nCassie: Wow. ( Sighs ) but you didn'T. You didn't, dinah, because you have changed. Everything has changed and your heart told you not to run off with my baby, not to rob me of my baby. \nDinah: No. Not necessarily. \nCassie: Come on.

It's from love. It's coming from love. It's not out of some guilt or a sense of obligation, reva. Why is that hard for you to believe? \nReva: I just keep thinking back to the moment right before I took a header down that elevator shaft, that you weren't very much in love then. \nJosh: I was angry at you, and I still am, but that doesn't mean I don't love you, reva.
