        "Billy: Hey. Didn't expect to see you here. Have you seen Jonathan around? What's Reva doing here out of the hospital?",
        "Josh: Just being Reva.",

        "I've never stopped loving you, Reva, and as for helping you now, it's just the right thing to do.",
        "Reva: So what was I saying? Oh, that's right. I remember. I was actually telling you that I was an impulsive type of girl. I do what I want, when I want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "( Sirens wailing )",
        "Michelle: The baby. The baby's in the car. Help me, please. Help me. Somebody, please help me. Please.",
        "E.M.T.: Stay back.",
        "Michelle: No, my baby.",
        "E.M.T.: The car could explode.",
        "Michelle: My baby's in the car! Let go of me! ( Explosion ) ( Screams )",

        "Cassie: Dinah? Edmund? Is everything okay? Edmund?",
        "Edmund: Cassie? Everything's fine, but your daughter couldn't wait to be born at the hospital.",
        "Cassie: Daughter? It's a girl?",
        "Edmund: A very healthy girl.",
        "Cassie: She's here, and she's fine?",
        "Edmund: And she's perfect. And I've called an ambulance from Cedars. They're going to send one right over, check her out, make sure she's okay.",
        "Cassie: Oh, my God. She's so beautiful. Hey. You are so precious and so perfect.",
        "Edmund: Would you like to hold her? Sweetheart, here's your mommy. Oh, she's sleeping-- I think almost. Here you go. Isn't she the most beautiful thing in the whole world? Well, alongside her mother, at least. We did it, Cassie. Together we created a whole new life. And it was worth everything I... everything we had to do to make it happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Question.",
        "Marina: Mm-hmm.",
        "Danny: So we've decided that we're going to move in together.",
        "Marina: Yes.",
        "Danny: Why don't we start now, while I'm stuck at the Beacon? Hm?",
        "Marina: Tomorrow?",
        "Danny: How about tonight? Yes?",
        "Marina: Okay. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Danny: Oh, I'm sorry. Danny Santos.",
        "E.M.T.: There's been an accident, Mr. Santos. You need to get to Cedars Hospital right away.",

        "Reva: Mm.",
        "Bar patron: Hm. Buy you another drink?",
        "Reva: Sure.",
        "Josh: Why don't you let me do that?",
        "Bar patron: Excuse me? What?",
        "Billy: Why don't you just come with me for a second? Let me explain something to you.",
        "Josh: Why did you leave the hospital?",
        "Reva: There's only so much a girl can take.",
        "Josh: Of what?",
        "Reva: Pity, from her husband, who's only sticking around until her back heals.",
        "Josh: Reva, come on.",
        "Reva: You know what, Joshua? I don't think we make each other happy anymore, you know, because before this accident, you told me you needed a break from me. Well, now maybe I need a break from you.",
        "Josh: No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: She's so beautiful.",
        "Edmund: She has your eyes.",
        "Cassie: She's barely an hour old.",
        "Edmund: Doesn't matter. I'd know those eyes anywhere.",
        "Cassie: So she was born here? How did it happen? I want to know everything.",
        "Edmund: Well, there's really not much to tell. Dinah was fine, and then all of a sudden, well, it happened very fast.",
        "Cassie: What happened?",
        "Edmund: Well, there's really not much to tell. Dinah was fine, and then all of a sudden, well, it happened very fast. I tried to get her out to the car, but she couldn't walk, and so I brought her back in here. I was able to call you, but not 911.",
        "Cassie: You delivered your own child. How amazing is that?",
        "Edmund: Pretty amazing.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Well, where is Dinah? I just want to see her, and I want to thank her.",
        "Edmund: Dinah's not here, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Well, what do you mean, she's not here?",
        "Edmund: She's gone.",

        "Dinah: ( Gasps ) What is going on? What is going on? What is going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Excuse me. I'm Danny Santos. I got a call that my ex-wife was in a car accident.",
        "Nurse: They just brought her in. Wait here a moment.",
        "Dr. Lee: Mr. Santos? I'm Dr. Lee. I'm treating your wife.",
        "Danny: What happened? Is she okay?",
        "Dr. Lee: She was in a car accident.",
        "Danny: Well, is she in there? Can I see her?",
        "Dr. Lee: Just for a minute. We need to run some tests. Only one visitor at a time.",
        "Marina: Of course. Go ahead. I'll be out here.",
        "Danny: Yeah, all right. I'll be right back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: You're trying to push me away.",
        "Reva: No, I don't want to hurt you anymore.",
        "Josh: I think you do, because if you don't hurt me, then I'm not going to walk away, and that means I'm just sticking around because I feel sorry for you. That's basically the idea, right?",
        "Reva: No.",
        "Josh: I think it is. And you need to lie down, Reva.",
        "Reva: See, that's what I can't take anymore. You're smothering me.",
        "Josh: Since when is a husband caring about his wife's health and well-being \"smothering\"?",
        "Reva: I don't want you to care about me.",
        "Josh: You don't get to choose, Reva. I care. This is me, standing here in front of you, caring. Now, what happens if I walk out of here right now and your leg goes numb? Hm?",
        "Reva: I guess I sit for a while.",
        "Josh: And what happens when you're ready to leave?",
        "Reva: Well, I have very strong arms.",
        "Josh: And a very strong will.",
        "Reva: Don't you forget it.",
        "Josh: Just let me take you home, Reva. Then you can heal, and then we can handle whatever it is we have to handle in our relationship.",
        "Reva: That sounds like so much fun.",
        "Josh: In fact, you know, you really shouldn't walk at all, so maybe I should just throw you over my shoulder like a sack of potatoes...",
        "Bar patron: Hey, leave the lady alone. Hey.",
        "Josh: You know what? I can handle this, thank you very much.",
        "Bar patron: I said leave the lady alone.",
        "Josh: Back off, Buddy.",
        "Bar patron: Hey.",
        "Reva: Joshua. And I'm supposed to be the immature one?",

        "Rick: Is Danny here? Have you seen him anywhere?",
        "Marina: Yeah, he's in there with Michelle. Is she going to be okay? Rick.",
        "Rick: Oh, I'm sorry. Dr. Lee just briefed me. Michelle's vitals are good. There's no broken bones or obvious injuries to speak of, except for the lacerations, so we're just going to keep her overnight for observation.",
        "Marina: She's going to be okay?",
        "Rick: Physically I think she's going to be fine.",
        "Marina: What do you mean?",
        "Rick: Marina, I'm going to give Danny some time alone with my little sister. I think it would be a good idea if you do the same thing. Excuse me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Oh, Michelle, please be all right. Please be all right.",
        "Michelle: Danny? Danny?",
        "Danny: Hey. I'm here. I'm here, Michelle.",
        "Michelle: Danny.",
        "Danny: Listen, you were in a car accident. You need to take it easy, but you're going to be okay.",
        "Michelle: The baby. Where's the baby?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I thought you said the ambulance didn't get here. Where did Dinah go?",
        "Edmund: She's gone, Cassie. She took right off after the baby was born.",
        "Cassie: Why?",
        "Edmund: I don't know. It was all very intense for her, very emotional.",
        "Cassie: But Edmund, how did she leave?",
        "Edmund: I took the baby into the kitchen to clean her off, and when I came back, Dinah wasn't here. And then I saw her drive off.",
        "Cassie: Right after she gave birth?",
        "Edmund: I don't... I don't know. When she saw the baby, the second she saw the baby, she became extremely emotional. My best guess is that she just needed to get out of here before she became too attached.",
        "Cassie: Edmund, where did she go?",
        "Edmund: I don't know. I don't know. I tried to call her, but I think she's just disappeared.",
        "Cassie: This is bad, okay? She can't be out there by herself. She needs to be examined by a doctor.",
        "Edmund: I know. My God.",
        "Cassie: This is bad. Edmund, this is bad. Will you bring me the phone? I'm going to try calling her cell.",
        "Edmund: Yes, of course. And it's worth a try, but I've already left her five messages, I think.",
        "Cassie: You know what? Then we're going to have to call Ross, okay, because maybe he can find her.",
        "Edmund: Good, good. Again, it's worth a try, but Cassie, as awful as this may sound, I think... I think maybe this might not be so bad. I mean, we always thought that Dinah might be a threat to the baby.",
        "Cassie: Edmund, look at what she did for us. Oh, my God. I should have seen this. I just should have seen this coming, because she was just acting so crazy earlier. She was acting completely irrational, saying that I didn't know her at all, that she had done something terrible.",
        "Edmund: What? That doesn't make any sense. She just gave us the greatest gift in the world. Cassie. Cassie, Cassie, just... here. We'll find her, I promise. Come on. We'll find her. I promise we'll find her. But right now, I think your daughter's hungry.",
        "Cassie: You're right. You're right. Okay. I'm sorry, Sweetie. Hey, Baby. Mommy is going to take care of you. I have a whole bunch of formula to feed you. ( Laughs )",
        "Edmund: See how she responds to you? She knows her mother already.",
        "Cassie: I can't believe she's here. Oh. I can't stand the thought of Dinah being out there alone.",
        "Edmund: This is a miracle. She's our miracle baby.",
        "Cassie: You're right. She is. I just really hope that wherever Dinah is, she knows the gift she gave us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: What is this? What is going on? I took it off? Why would I take it off? Oh, my head's pounding. I need some water. Who moved the glasses? What's going on? Something's not right here. What is this? I need some air. What the heck? What's... Edmund! Where is everybody?",
        "Edmund: I've been working on our getaway.",
        "Dinah: Our what?",
        "Edmund: Let's leave Ross a videotaped message. That way he'll have something to remember you by. I'm sorry I have to do this, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: You kidnapped me. You locked me up here. You sick and twisted man. You locked me up! Somebody help me! Get me out of here! Please!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: You know, I'm very flattered, but that's... Billy. Stop it!",
        "Josh: What did I do?",
        "Billy: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.",
        "Josh: Got a couple guys fighting over you. I bet you're thrilled to pieces about that, huh?",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, you know something? Your left isn't as good as it used to be, and that's not what I wanted.",
        "Josh: What do you want then, Reva? That's the question, you know? I mean, at the hospital, you said you wanted me to be with you, but only if that's what I wanted. And then you practically admitted that you were thinking about pretending that you would be, you know, more seriously injured than you really are just to keep me around. So whatever it is, Reva, I'm here, and you're getting what you want.",
        "Reva: Well, what I said at the hospital was panic. I was scared because I really thought maybe you would walk out on me. But you know what? I realized something. I realized that we don't have to pretend with each other anymore. I don't want the quiet life you want, Joshua.",
        "Josh: I didn't say I wanted a quiet life. I'm the one that said, \"Hey, let's move to Aspen\" or \"Let's go to Paris,\" or let's go here, let's go there.",
        "Reva: You know what I mean.",
        "Josh: Actually, I don't.",
        "Reva: I know what you're offering me. I do. And I'm telling you that you could walk me up and down the Himalayas, and it wouldn't be enough. Because you're not enough for me anymore. Is that clear enough? Do you finally get it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Thanks again. Well, you heard the doctor yourself. You're perfect, little one.",
        "Cassie: She is perfect. You know, we can't keep calling her \"little one,\" or \"the world's most beautiful daughter,\" or \"the world's best little girl ever.\" ( Laughs ) We're going to have to come up with a name, and all the ones we talked about, they just don't seem right for her.",
        "Edmund: Let's see. Are you a Fiona? Ella? Isabella? No. Cassie, none of them quite fit.",
        "Cassie: ( Laughs ) Tell us. Tell us what we should name you.",
        "Edmund: She says she's a miracle baby.",
        "Cassie: Miracle Winslow?",
        "Edmund: Yeah, no.",
        "Cassie: Heaven knows, we had to go through everything to have you. All those hormone shots. Ouch. Mommy was sore, and had a sore tummy a lot for you.",
        "Edmund: And I'm never going to tell you what daddy had to go through.",
        "Cassie: It doesn't matter, because it was all worth it, because here you are.",
        "Edmund: All worth it. Even you getting angry at me for bringing Dinah into the mix, because if I hadn't, you'd never have been here. From now on, there's nothing but bottles to make and diapers to change and lullabies to sing and years to look forward to, all because we had hope and we never, ever gave up.",
        "Cassie: Edmund, that's it. Hope. That's her name. Yes.",
        "Edmund: Yes, because hope changes everything. Cassie, I am so happy right now, and I am so filled with love.",
        "Cassie: Me, too.",
        "( Knock on door )",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie? Hi. Got your message. Whoa. Wow. When?",
        "Cassie: Isn't she the most beautiful thing you've ever seen? Hope, meet Jeffrey. Jeffrey, meet Hope.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: I have to get the hell out of here. No cell phone. Of course, he took it. Okay, all right. I'm just going to relax. I'm going to relax, because you know what? Someone's going to find me. I just need to breathe, and I just need to wait. That's what I'm going to do. I'm just going to wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Danny, the baby.",
        "Danny: Shh.",
        "Michelle: The baby.",
        "Danny: Michelle. No, Robbie's fine. He wasn't in the car with you.",
        "Michelle: No, no. No, no, no, you don't understand.",
        "Danny: Shh, shh, shh. You need to relax.",
        "Michelle: No, please, I need to see the baby. I just need to see it.",
        "Danny: Rick.",
        "Rick: Just give me a second.",
        "Danny: Something's wrong. She's talking about a baby.",
        "Rick: Honey, it's Rick. I'm here, honey. Everything's going to be okay. You're going to be fine, sweetheart, okay?",
        "Michelle: The baby. Where's my baby?",
        "Danny: See what I mean? See what I mean? Something's wrong with her.",
        "Rick: Listen. Listen to me, Sweetie. Danny and I, we're going to go in the hallway just for a few minutes, and I'll be right back.",
        "Michelle: ( Whimpers )",
        "Rick: I just want you to close your eyes and try to get some rest, okay?",
        "Michelle: Danny.",
        "Rick: I love you.",
        "Marina: How is she?",
        "Danny: I don't know, I don't know. She hit her head again. She's not making any sense. Why does she keep talking about a baby?",
        "Marina: Was it Robbie?",
        "Danny: She thinks that Robbie was in the car with her. Please, tell me this is not happening again.",
        "Rick: No, Danny, that's not it. That's not it.",
        "Danny: What? What do you mean?",
        "Rick: And Danny, I'm really sorry that you have to find out this way.",
        "Danny: What? What? My God, she's pregnant?",
        "Rick: She was pregnant. It's the reason she took off after Tony died. I just found out a couple days ago myself.",
        "Danny: What? I don't understand. I saw her. I just saw her.",
        "Rick: She was hiding it. She was hiding.",
        "Danny: Why? Why did she hide that? Oh, my God.",
        "Rick: Unfortunately, Danny, she didn't know who the father was. She was waiting to take a paternity test. That never happened.",
        "Danny: What happened? You said she was pregnant. What happened to the baby?",
        "Rick: We think Michelle went into labor while she was driving the car. That's what caused the accident. She gave birth in the car, and somehow she managed to get out of the car. But before she could go back in to get the baby, the car... the car just exploded, Danny.",
        "Marina: Oh, my God.",
        "Rick: The baby didn't make it. I am so sorry.",
        "Danny: ( Sobs )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Isn't she incredible?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, she's... she's cute, in a wrinkly sort of way.",
        "Cassie: All newborns are wrinkly.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. I've heard that. I haven't been around too many of them, actually.",
        "Cassie: Would you like to hold her?",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, I... you know, I don't think that's a good idea. You know, you're supposed to hold their heads in a certain way, and, you know, I don't know how to do that.",
        "Cassie: It's not hard. I can show you.",
        "Jeffrey: Are you sure?",
        "Cassie: Yes, I'm sure.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, if Uncle Jeff isn't comfortable, perhaps there will be other opportunities.",
        "Cassie: Well, there will be plenty of opportunities. But I know you're dying to hold her. Edmund, we need to call people, and we need to tell them that Hope is here. I left the list in the kitchen in the drawer. Can you get it?",
        "Edmund: Okay.",
        "Cassie: Wow, look at you. Do you think you've finally met a woman who's immune to your charms?",
        "Jeffrey: I... you know, I'm afraid I would drop her.",
        "Cassie: No. You have nice, big, strong arms.",
        "Edmund: I'll make those calls.",
        "Cassie: Here. There. Just support her head.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Well, she's... so tiny.",
        "Cassie: ( Laughs ) This is a picture.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, let's not get carried away. I'm just glad she's not screaming.",
        "Cassie: Oh, you guys are fast friends.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, we have a lot in common. We have you. Now, aren't you supposed to, like, you know, rock her or, you know, bounce her or something?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Just be gentle, just real gentle.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, how's that?",
        "Cassie: I think you're a natural.",

        "Reva: I'm sorry, Joshua. I know that you should be enough, because you are a wonderful, smart, sexy man, and that should be enough for me. But this is my problem, and I need to work it out on my own.",
        "Josh: How? When, Reva, are you going to do that? And what's it going to take? I mean, Nate clearly didn't do it for you. The guy practically murdered you, Reva, and it still didn't take care of whatever it is that's going on inside of you right now. You fell down an elevator shaft, Reva. So what is it going to take?",
        "Reva: I just know that I can't take this anymore, because it's not working. And you know it, too, because you're as miserable as I am.",
        "Josh: You got that right. You really think that you're going to find whatever it is you're looking for someplace else?",
        "Reva: I don't know.",
        "Josh: You know, um, life is not a roller coaster, Reva that sends you speeding off to the next exciting adventure. You have to create your own happiness. I don't know that I can do that for you.",
        "Reva: I know. But what's the alternative? You just need to know you are everything in the world to me. You're my heart and you're my soul. But I just need this time. You... we've made this wonderful life together.",
        "Josh: Don't do this.",
        "Reva: We have these two beautiful children. But I need time alone now. I do. I need to be able to work this out, figure out who I am and what it is that I want, sort it all out. And when that happens, then I pray to God that what I still want is you, and that you'll still want me. But if you don't...",

        "Marina: Oh, poor baby.",
        "Danny: Oh, God. She doesn't know. She thinks that the baby's still alive.",
        "Rick: She's in shock, so she doesn't need to know about the baby right now, and I would appreciate if everybody just not tell her until she gets stronger. And Danny, I wish I could tell you if I knew that child was yours...",

        "Danny: Okay. Hey, Michelle. Come here. I'll help you through this, Honey. I promise. Oh, God, that could have been my baby. Our baby. ( Sobs )",
        "Michelle: Danny?",

        "Dinah: You selfish liar.",
        "Edmund: You might want to rethink that, Dinah, considering I'm your only way out of here.",
        "Dinah: You know, you're also the one who put me in here.",
        "Edmund: Yes. Well, let's not split hairs, shall we? So what do you think of the place? I think I did a damn good job replicating a couple of the rooms of Cassie's farmhouse, especially considering the time crunch. I just wanted you to be comfortable.",
        "Dinah: You're not going to keep me in here.",
        "Edmund: You'll be fine, Dinah. I made sure. I mean, I'm just... look, if you think I'm enjoying this, I'm not! You have to be locked up someplace, don't you? And this isn't that bad, is it? Besides, you've always wanted to live in this house.",
        "Dinah: This isn't the real house, you psycho.",
        "Edmund: Yeah, well, it's close enough.",
        "Dinah: What are you doing? You are going to get caught.",
        "Edmund: I don't think so.",
        "Dinah: Why don't you tell me your grand plan here, okay? Because I'm out of the picture, what do you figure? That that's just going to reconnect you to Cassie? What did you tell her? That I took off with the baby, and that somehow you're going to go ahead and grieve with her during that process? She is with Jeffrey. There is nothing holding you to her anymore.",
        "Edmund: I wouldn't be so sure about that.",
        "Dinah: You're a fool. You're a fool. You could have had a life with me, and you have absolutely nothing right now.",
        "Edmund: Well, if thinking that makes you feel better, Dinah, then by all means go ahead.",
        "Dinah: Where are you going?",
        "Edmund: Well, I wanted to make sure you were all right, and I have. Ciao, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: ( Screams )",

        "Billy: Hi.",
        "Josh: You're right. What you're going through has nothing to do with me. But see, the thing is, I can't fight for you, Reva, and fight against you at the same time. So if this is really what you want, you're free. Go for it. Have fun.",
        "Billy: If you've got any sense at all, you'll go get him back. He's the best thing to ever happen to you.",
        "Reva: I know that.",
        "Billy: You're hiding this from him? Do you think he'd feel sorry for you? He didn't come and search you out because he feels sorry for you.",
        "Reva: I don't think that he knows why he searched me out, Billy, but I do know that before my accident, he wanted space, and now he can't leave me alone.",
        "Billy: He's crazy about you, and you are crazy about him. What the hell is going on with you, Reva?",
        "Reva: That's what I have to try to find out.",
        "Billy: I'm going to go get him back, okay?",
        "Reva: No. Don't. Please just let it be. I'm doing this for Joshua as much as I'm doing it for myself, because he deserves more than I can give him right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Why didn't she tell me she was pregnant? Why? What did I do? Did I do something, or say something to make her feel like she couldn't tell me that she was pregnant?",
        "Marina: No. I'm sure not. Danny, I don't know what to say, except I love you, and we're going to get through this, and we're going to get Michelle through this.",
        "Nurse: Your wife's awake, and she's asking for you.",
        "Michelle: Danny.",
        "Danny: Hey. Hey.",
        "Michelle: Danny, no one will tell me anything about the baby. You saw her. You were there.",
        "Danny: Michelle, no. I wasn't.",
        "Michelle: No, you were. You were there. You helped me deliver the baby.",
        "Danny: Michelle...",
        "Michelle: Yes. Yes.",
        "Danny: Honey, come here. Shh.",
        "Michelle: Remember? I was afraid because my contractions, they were one on top of the other, and then you were there, and you held my hand. You told me it would be okay. You told me to push, and I did. Please, Danny, I just need to see her. Please. Please. You've just got to show me the baby, please.",
        "Rick: Danny, I just need to give her something to calm her down.",
        "Michelle: Rick. ( Sobbing ) Where's the baby?",
        "Rick: Michelle, you need to rest.",
        "Michelle: Where's my baby?",
        "Danny: Michelle, you need to take it easy, okay? Rick's going to...",
        "Rick: Take it easy.",
        "Michelle: Rick, please. Where's the baby? You saw...",
        "Rick: Don't worry about the baby right now. I want you to just get some rest, okay? You need to sleep, okay?",
        "Michelle: But you've seen her, right? You've seen her.",
        "Rick: Honey, you need to take it easy.",
        "Danny: ( Shushes Michelle )",
        "Michelle: Danny, you were there.",
        "Danny: Michelle. Michelle.",
        "Michelle: You were there. ( Crying )",
        "Danny: Honey, I wasn't there. I wasn't there. Maybe you just... maybe you just wished that I was there, and I don't know, sometimes when you want things, your mind plays tricks on you.",
        "Michelle: No.",
        "Danny: You know, sometimes when I'm having a tough day, I still wish that you were there, too.",
        "Michelle: No. It was real. It was.",
        "Danny: You need to rest. Shh, shh, shh. It's okay. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep, okay?",

        "Jeffrey: So Dinah just took off after giving birth? I mean, that's very weird, even by her standards.",
        "Cassie: It's horrible. I am so upset about it. I can't... I hope she's okay. I hope she's okay. Do you want me to take her?",
        "Jeffrey: No, no. I got it. I mean, you know, I can hold her for you a little while longer. She's very mature for her age. I mean, she's only a couple of hours old, but...",
        "Cassie: Very. Very mature.",
        "Jeffrey: You know, she squeezed my finger earlier. She's very strong. You're going to be hell on wheels, just like your mother, aren't you?",
        "Edmund: Well, made all the calls. Everyone's thrilled. Come to Daddy, Sweetheart. Thank you. Hi. Well, you're so tired. You've had a very exciting day, haven't you? Yes, very exciting. Perhaps we should quiet things down a little and get her to rest.",
        "Jeffrey: You need anything before I go?",
        "Edmund: No, I think we're fine.",
        "Cassie: I'll walk you out.",
        "Jeffrey: I don't like this. I don't like the thought of you being alone with this guy. I mean, by the way, did you see the size of that suitcase? He packed for, like, two months. Now, listen. I can stay around here, keep an eye on you, you know.",
        "Cassie: I would love that.",
        "Jeffrey: I can stay in the barn. I don't mind.",
        "Cassie: You're sweet. You are. You are so sweet. He's only going to be here for a couple of days, and I'm not happy about it either. I'm not. But I can't begrudge him time with his child, so just stop talking and kiss me, please?",
        "Edmund: It's all right, Princess. Daddy's here. He's here to stay. ( Baby gurgles )",
