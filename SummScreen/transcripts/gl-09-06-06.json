        "\"Speak Now \"",
        "Jonathan and Lizzie prepare for their wedding. He tells Tammy that he will always love her and she tells him they are doing this for the right reasons. Lizzie talks to Roxie and tells her that now, they will be a family. Alan threatens Jonathan that he knows this marriage is a scam. At the ceremony, the clergyman asks if anyone has objections; many have pensive looks on their faces, but no one objects. During the ceremony, Jonathan constantly stares at Tammy, who is very sad. She is the maid-of-honor and gives the rings to Jonathan and Lizzie. After being pronounced man and wife, Jonathan kisses Lizzie and the post-wedding party begins. He immediately searches for Tammy, kisses her in secret and tells her to meet him later that night at Outskirts. After the party, Jonathan carries Lizzie over the threshold to their room at the Spaulding mansion. He prepares to meet Tammy. He is stopped as he tries to leave the room. Alan and the psychiatrist stop him in his tracks. Tammy goes to Outskirts and waits alone. Jonathan and Lizzie are in the room and Jonathan drinks one drink after another as Lizzie waits for him in bed dressed in a sexy negligee."

        "Jonathan: You okay?",
        "Tammy: Sure, I'm okay. Oh, you have a wedding to get ready for.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, I can't wait.",
        "Tammy: It's just a party, right?",
        "Jonathan: Except at the end of the party, I'm going to be Mr. Lizzie Spaulding.",
        "Tammy: Open it.",
        "Jonathan: That's very nice.",
        "Tammy: Yeah. And when you put it on, you just remember who you're really crazy about.",
        "Jonathan: Right. (Laughs) Like I could ever forget that.",
        "Tammy: So, are you like, I don't know, nervous?",
        "Jonathan: No, no. It's just a stupid plan to make sure that Alan can't lock up Lizzie and take the baby. I mean, you know that you are the only person I could ever really be married to, right?",
        "Tammy: I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Today is the day that we all become a family. Yep, yep, it is. You, me, the baby, Jonathan. Can you believe Jonathan? Who would have thought? I know that Jonathan is in love with Tammy. That Tammy's a better friend than I probably ever deserve. I would never do anything to hurt either one of them. But sometimes... sometimes things happen for a reason. They do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I wish I could stay here forever.",
        "Jonathan: Hmm.",
        "Tammy: I shouldn't even be here. If anybody catches us in bed together, we're dead.",
        "Jonathan: Okay, we'll be very careful, very careful. But before you go, can you come here a minute. (Knock on the door)",
        "Lizzie: Oh, my goodness. You know if I was my granddad, I would have busted you guys, and we'd all be screwed.",
        "Jonathan: Relax, it's under control, okay. And now, are you okay with all of this?",
        "Lizzie: Well, it's only, let me see, my freedom and my baby's future at stake.",
        "Jonathan: Okay, sarcasm. Let me see. I was talking about today, the wedding, because women, especially you, have a tendency to get a little carried away.",
        "Lizzie: Hi, I get it. I'm not thinking of this marriage as a marriage. I know that you love Tammy. And I know, it's an act.",
        "Jonathan: All right. As long as we're all on the same page.",
        "Lizzie: Which is why I was thinking of a plan. Tammy could be our wedding party, and she could hold the ring.",
        "Tammy: Whoa, whoa, whoa.",
        "Lizzie: If you're the wedding party, it completely backs up the story we told in court yesterday. It will make it seem like you're trying to help the baby.",
        "Tammy: I guess I do have a dress I could wear. I guess I should take this off now, too.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, come here.",
        "Jonathan: Bear with me. I'm not used to wearing your jewelry, you know what I mean? I'm with you.",
        "Tammy: I should go iron your tux shirt.",
        "Jonathan: You don't have to do that.",
        "Tammy: Who's going to do it, you?",
        "Jonathan: (Laughs) Babe, wait. Is everyone 100%, because if you're getting cold feet, and you want to back out, we do it now and there is no hard feelings. Just say it. Last chance.",
        "Lizzie: I'm here the whole way to the end of the ride.",
        "Jonathan: Tam?",
        "Tammy: We don't have a choice, do we? This plan is going to save your baby. And if we can pull it off...",
        "Jonathan: Alan won't even know what hit him. So we are all good? Good.",
        "Lizzie: Tammy, thanks for doing this for me and the baby.",
        "Tammy: No problem. I know you would do the same thing for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Knock on the door)",
        "Delivery man: Lizzie Spaulding?",
        "Tammy: She's not here right now, but I can sign for it.",
        "Alan: What a shame it isn't yours. This must be very hard on you, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: I'll get through it. They're doing the right thing for the baby.",
        "Alan: You're a remarkable woman. Very selfless.",
        "Tammy: No. This is the right thing for me, too.",
        "Alan: I warned you, remember, the bond that happens between mother and father. Can you imagine how strong this bond is going to get when they're husband and wife?",
        "Tammy: Good. I hope it is strong.",
        "Alan: Very soon Elizabeth is going to be walking down that aisle, very pregnant with Jonathan's baby. She's going to give him one of the greatest gifts you can give a man, and that is your first- born child. That is something you will never give him.",
        "Tammy: Stop trying to mess with my head.",
        "Alan: Well, if you're right, if this is a real marriage, I'm certain they will have to consummate it. See you at the ceremony.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Wow, what's that all for? You throwing a party?",
        "Jonathan: Kind of. A wedding.",
        "Reva: Oh, don't tell me that you and Tammy--",
        "Jonathan: Even better, or worse, depending on how you look at it. Me and Lizzie.",
        "Reva: What?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, it's just an act, you know, to keep Alan away from the kid. It's temporary. Oh, come on, I thought you would be behind me on this, coming through for Lizzie and the baby.",
        "Reva: I'm glad that you're stepping up, Jonathan, but--",
        "Jonathan: It's not that bad.",
        "Reva: For who, you or Tammy?",
        "Jonathan: Tammy is totally on board. Obviously today is going to suck for her, but she knows it's not for real.",
        "Reva: Just be careful, because marriage is marriage.",
        "Jonathan: Wise words, Reva.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, I've done it once or twice.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I bet you have. I have to get my penguin suit on. Would you like to come by Main Street later and come see the show.",
        "Reva: You know what, I wouldn't miss it. What happens if Lizzie gets used to the idea of being married to you.",
        "Jonathan: No, not a chance. She would rather marry the dog of hers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lillian: Do you have a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu?",
        "Lizzie: Can I just be happy? You're the only family member on my side.",
        "Lillian: I want you to be happy. But you know what your granddad told me, he told me that none of this is real. It is all an act for the judge.",
        "Lizzie: Do you like my hair like this?",
        "Lillian: You know, I think this is an act for the judge and for Jonathan, but not for you. Because you want it to be real, because you want to be with him because you love him.",
        "Lizzie: You have to look at the bad side of things, Nana. I mean, look at what I'm doing for my baby.",
        "Lillian: I am. But I don't think this plan is going to work out for you. He is going to love the baby, but you told me yourself he doesn't love you. He's in love with Tammy. He will love the baby.",
        "Lizzie: We should finish my hair.",
        "Lillian: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Well, if it isn't the blushing groom.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I just came by to pick up some things of Lizzie's for our honeymoon.",
        "Alan: Very thoughtful of you.",
        "Jonathan: And while I'm here, I thought that you and I could share a cigar before the wedding, since we are about to, you know, become family.",
        "Alan: You know, you can smile all you want, son, but all I see is dead man walking.",
        "Jonathan: I'm full of joy. Marrying Lizzie could not make me any happier. And Lizzie, well, she is positively glowing. The only thing I regret is that I didn't have time to ask you or Phillip for her hand.",
        "Alan: Why don't you be honest with me? How long do you think you can keep this up? You and I both know that you love Tammy, and I'm going to catch you sneaking out to be with her, and when I do, the judge is going to declare your home unfit for the baby, and Elizabeth will be put away to protect the baby, and your little game is going to be over.",
        "Jonathan: I'm not going to get caught sneaking out anywhere. Why would I sneak out when I have Lizzie? Body and soul. I can't wait for the honeymoon. I mean the girl's crazy in bed. You know what the best part is, I don't have to worry about getting my little wifey pregnant because I've already got that taken care of. Well, I'll see you at the wedding, grandpa.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Honey, are you sure-- are you sure this is what you really want to do?",
        "Tammy: Of course I want it. I'm doing this for Jonathan's baby. I've got to try to make it work.",
        "Cassie: Okay, okay, I get this is all for show, but do you have to be the maid of honor?",
        "Tammy: Actually, it's kind of funny when you start to think about it.",
        "Cassie: I'm sorry, I think I'm missing the humor. Okay, honey, look, I'm extremely proud of you, for forgiving Jonathan, for taking Lizzie in, for being open of the idea of this baby in your life. But...",
        "Tammy: But?",
        "Cassie: But I think this is asking a lot of you.",
        "Tammy: Nobody asked. I volunteered.",
        "Cassie: Something being okay in your head doesn't always make it okay in your heart.",
        "Tammy: I love him, Mom. I love him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: The wedding is going to start in a couple of minutes. Have you even heard from mom?",
        "Lillian: No, and I'm really concerned. Because even though she didn't approve, it is your wedding.",
        "Lizzie: I'm not even surprised. She's been as bad as granddad.",
        "Lillian: I don't like any of her outlooks. I didn't approve of her marriage, but I went. Lizzie, I don't know, maybe she is right about all of this.",
        "Lizzie: No, no, no. Listen to me. I know exactly what I'm doing. It's not a fairytale wedding. Yeah, I'm pregnant. But does that mean it can't be special and beautiful?",
        "Lillian: Oh, sweetheart.",
        "Lizzie: I just want this for the baby, Nana. I want to show her pictures and tell her she was there. (Laughter)",
        "Alan-Michael: Is this the line to hug the bride?",
        "Lizzie: Thanks for coming.",
        "Alan-Michael: I had so much fun at the last one, I couldn't miss it.",
        "Jonathan: Where is my bride?!!",
        "Lizzie: (Squeals) Here I am.",
        "Jonathan: This is for you.",
        "Lizzie: Thank you. It's beautiful. I love it. Thank you.",
        "Jonathan: You're welcome. I went shopping at your favorite store, Spaulding mansion.",
        "Lizzie: (Laughs) Oh, we make a good team.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy seems to think so.",
        "Lizzie: And how do I look?",
        "Jonathan: You look like you're about to either get married or take a shower.",
        "Lizzie: Be serious!",
        "Jonathan: You look great. You look great.",
        "Lizzie: Thank you... for everything. Stepping up for our daughter and...",
        "Jonathan: You don't need to thank me for that. Tammy and I are always going to do whatever we need to do for her, so... can I make an honest woman out of you?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, let's do it! (Laughing)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Hey, you guys are just doing this to keep the baby away from Alan, right?",
        "Tammy: Ssh... not so loud, Officer?",
        "Marina: I have one question: Are you absolutely out of your mind? This is Lizzie Spaulding we're talking about. I know her. You know her.",
        "Tammy: I know, I know.",
        "Marina: And you're going to trust her with your boyfriend? I'm sorry, I was at the last wedding Lizzie engineered and she had Coop believing that that was his baby. She had us all believing that lie.",
        "Tammy: I don't know what to tell you. Lizzie's changed since that whole mess with Coop. She's admitted her mistakes. She's ready to do what's right.",
        "Marina: What are you and Jonathan going to do?",
        "Tammy: We'll get through this and we'll be stronger than ever. (Guests react)",
        "Marina: Not so easy, is it?",
        "Tammy: You look amazing.",
        "Lizzie: Really?",
        "Tammy: You know you do.",
        "Lizzie: You didn't ask for any of this, Tammy. And I know on some level this must be a nightmare and I just want you to know that I really am sorry.",
        "Tammy: Lizzie, we've been over all this.",
        "Lizzie: No, I can't seem to say it enough. I really am sorry, and I'm not used to this whole having friends things. Especially not someone like you, who actually believes in me. Thank you so much for standing up for me today.",
        "Tammy: Wow. You know I wouldn't be much of a maid of honor if I didn't give you something new, something old-- your dress is new, and I know you're wearing blue undies.",
        "Lizzie and Tammy: (Laugh)",
        "Tammy: The necklace looks antique.",
        "Lizzie: You know, this is from Jonathan.",
        "Tammy: Really?",
        "Lizzie: I guess all I need now is something borrowed.",
        "Tammy: You have that.",
        "Lizzie: I do. I do?",
        "Tammy: Jonathan.",
        "Lizzie: Looks like we're ready to get started. (Classical music playing) (Whispers) Granddad, please don't. You can't stop this wedding.",
        "Alan: (Whispers) Someone has to walk you down the aisle. May I have the honor? (Wedding music playing)",
        "Lizzie: Nothing would make me happier.",
        "Alan: She's all yours-- for now.",
        "Judge: Dearly beloved, we are here to join this couple in holy matrimony. If anyone has just cause as to why they should not be united, let them speak now or forever hold their peace. Very well. I'm told the couple has written their own vows.",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie, standing here in front of all these people, I want to say that I know, without a doubt, that we can and will have a great life together. I promise to keep you and our baby safe and secure, and I promise to do everything in my power to make you happy.",
        "Lizzie: Jonathan, you're my hero. You have taught me how to stand up for myself. And how to be proud of who I am, the good and the bad. And how to respect myself. You love more deeply and more completely than anyone I've ever known. I'm so glad that I do know you, and I'm so glad that you're my baby's father.",
        "Judge: May we have the rings, please? Ms. Winslow, the rings. Do you, Elizabeth Lillian Spaulding, take this man, Jonathan Randall, to be your husband, in sickness and in health, for richer or poorer, to death do you part?",
        "Lizzie: I do.",
        "Judge: Do you, Jonathan Randall, take Elizabeth to be your wife, in sickness and in health, for richer or poorer, until death do you part?",
        "Jonathan: I do.",
        "Alan-Michael: There goes the neighborhood.",
        "Judge: The ring is a symbol of continuity and wholeness, it is a symbol of longevity and commitment, and it symbolizes the never-ending circle of love. May it be a permanent reminder of your vows to each other. And together, repeat after me: I give this ring to you as a sign of my love.",
        "Jonathan and Lizzie: I give this ring to you as a sign of my love.",
        "Judge: I vow to love and sustain you. Let nothing tear us asunder.",
        "Lizzie and Jonathan: I vow to love and sustain you and let nothing tear us asunder.",
        "Judge: May you always share with each other the gifts of love, and be one of heart and in mind. By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Well, you don't usually give in.",
        "Alan: Why give in when winning is so much easier.",
        "Alexandra: So Jonathan wins the battle, huh?",
        "Alan: But the victory belongs to me.",
        "Judge: Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Mr. And Mrs. Jonathan Randall. (Applause and cheers)",
        "Lizzie: I know this was all for show, but, um, it's still a really happy day.",
        "Jonathan: Listen, I'm happy for you and all that, but I've got to go find Tammy.",
        "Lizzie: But you can't go anywhere--",
        "Jonathan: I'll be right back.",
        "Lizzie: We just got married, people want to see us together. What should I tell them?",
        "Jonathan: I don't know, tell them I went to the can or something.",
        "Lizzie: How romantic.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Hey.",
        "Tammy: You shouldn't be here. We'll get caught.",
        "Jonathan: I'll go back in a few seconds. No one will even notice.",
        "Tammy: That the groom is gone? Who will notice that, huh?",
        "Jonathan: The ceremony was pretty rough. It's okay to admit that it sucked.",
        "Tammy: I'm being stupid. It was hard to see the two of you up there.",
        "Jonathan: I love you, you know that, right?",
        "Tammy: I know, I know. Of course.",
        "Jonathan: I'll see you tonight.",
        "Tammy: Alan will be watching you. He probably has a ton of investigators on the job, spies on the corner...",
        "Jonathan: We're going to meet at Outskirts. Alan can do whatever he wants, but he's not going to keep us apart. I don't care what I have to do, I'll be with you.",
        "Tammy: He's never kept us apart before.",
        "Jonathan: See, now you're talking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Where is your husband?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, he just went to check on-- uh-- went to the bathroom.",
        "Alan: So he couldn't wait even five minutes before he had to go and find Tammy.",
        "Lizzie: It's not like that.",
        "Alan: All right. I just wanted to step out here and tell you that you were a beautiful bride, absolutely radiant, and I hope this is all you dreamed it could be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Well, we have the groom and the bridesmaid, right out of a romance novel.",
        "Tammy: I was just congratulating Jonathan. It was a beautiful ceremony.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, yes, it was.",
        "Tammy: Excuse me.",
        "Jonathan: Alexandra, it is time to get this party started.",
        "Alexandra: Well, yes.",
        "Lizzie: Hey, where have you been. We're newlyweds, people expect to see us together.",
        "Jonathan: Uh-huh. You just give me a minute, and I'll impress you and all of your rich friends, okay?",
        "Lizzie: Okay. Hey, listen, I know that this must be a really horrible day for Tammy, but I want you to know that she is always going to be welcome in our family.",
        "Cassie: Lizzie, there is no family with you and Jonathan. None of this is real.",
        "Lizzie: I'm just saying that in case anyone is listening. I know that Jonathan loves Tammy. You must admit, we made it pretty convincing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: I definitely thought that I would be scared at first, but once you get up there and you start saying the vows, it just flies. It just flies.",
        "Lizzie: (Laughing)",
        "Jonathan: Yeah! (Applause and cheers)",
        "Lizzie: Oh! I'm not afraid of what anybody has to say can you love me will you love me with the lights on here when the lights are on let the world see, hey, let our love be strong and if everyone is watching us let 'em watch, let 'em talk let them believe what we need is what we are I'll turn it around like an angel...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: (Laughing) Um, the wedding was so nice, wasn't it?",
        "Jonathan: Yep. You going to be okay here by yourself, because I'm going to run out and meet Tammy.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, um...",
        "Jonathan: What's wrong?",
        "Lizzie: I don't know. It's our first night as husband and wife.",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie...",
        "Lizzie: I'm kidding. You know, I just meant for appearances sake.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, well, I think we did enough for appearance sake, don't you?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I was just hoping... nothing.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. Bye.",
        "Lizzie: Bye.",
        "Alan: Going somewhere, son? You weren't going to walk out and leave your new bride here to fend for herself, were you, Jonathan?",
        "Jonathan: I was gonna get some ice.",
        "Alan: You were going to get some ice. What are you going to carry it in, your hands? Where's your ice bucket?",
        "Jonathan: I was going to use this ice bucket, if it's okay with you. Did you want something?",
        "Alan: Oh, I just wanted to stop by and say congratulations again.",
        "Jonathan: Thank you, thank you. Oh! (Laughs) Dr. Baker, I see that you brought your friend.",
        "Alan: Well, I wanted him to come and stand by and guard the place so no one would bother you and Lizzie.",
        "Jonathan: (Laughing) Really? Is that right?",
        "Alan: Yeah.",
        "Jonathan: Don't you worry about it. As a matter of fact, I'm going to get back in there because it is our wedding night. But do me a favor, if either of you guys, you, too, pass the front desk, ask them if they can send up some ice, and maybe some strawberries and cream and chocolate or-- I don't know. Your granddaughter and I have a long night ahead of us. Goodnight gentlemen.",
        "Alan: Don't leave the hallway. If he walks out, I want you to call me immediately.",
        "Doctor: Understood. Do I get physical with him?",
        "Alan: Oh, no, no, no. We don't want to force him to stay in there. We want to make it very easy for him to leave.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Alan's got his freak guarding the hallway.",
        "Lizzie: I guess granddad really meant business.",
        "Jonathan: Well, I've got to get out of here because I have to meet Tammy. If I don't meet Tammy--",
        "Lizzie: I know, I know. But you know if we are stuck here, maybe we could celebrate.",
        "Jonathan: Celebrate what?",
        "Lizzie: Ah, let me think. How about the fact that we actually survived our fake wedding? Cheers.",
        "Jonathan: (Coughs)",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Reva: I just feel like a ghost, you know, getting a chance to glimpse what life will be like once I'm gone.",
        "Marina: Hey Granddaddy, you look incredibly handsome.",
        "Buzz: Oh, dear. Am I going to have to call the lawyers about that naughty video of yours?",
