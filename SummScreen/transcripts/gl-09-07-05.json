        "Bill: Okay then.",
        "Ava: And I don't. And I won't. Because I'm starting classes at Springfield U, just as soon as I can get the money together.",
        "Bill: Okay, we're going to make that a little faster. It's going to happen faster. How's that, Bill? Because Olivia pays better. She's got a dental plan. Fantastic. Keep that smile to pearly whites. And you get to see me everyday which is a perk in itself.",
        "Ava: You're being really nice to me. Why?",
        "Bill: I'm Bill Lewis. It's my nature. It's what I do.",

        "Coop: I...",
        "Lizzie: We'll see.",
        "Coop: We'll see. I don't know. This pain is kind of spreading a little bit. I think I may need one of your extra strength kisses.",
        "Lizzie: You can take an extra strength aspirin. I got to go back to work.",
        "Coop: What are you doing here anyway?",
        "Lizzie: Well, coffee run. Company serves the best coffee in town.",
        "Coop: Lucky for me.",

        "Lizzie: What?",
        "Coop: Nothing. Nothing. Don't worry about it.",
        "Lizzie: Do you know what she makes me do? She has me cut up a banana for her cereal every single morning in seven perfect slices.",
        "Coop: Well, welcome to show biz then. Look at the... hey, hey, hey. Look at it on the bright side. Whatever pays the bills. And, once you're flushed with cash, we can go off on one of those exciting adventures that we've always had planned. Huh?",
        "Beth: Like go on a honeymoon?",
        "Coop: I'm sorry. What did you say?",

        "Buzz: One more time.",
        "Beth: Oh, I'm sorry, Buzz. You joined the program already in progress. Why don't you ask your son about his proposal?",

        "Coop: No, I think you should stick around for just another minute, huh.",
        "Beth: What's with all the secrecy, huh, Lizzie? You should be shouting this from the rooftops. Come on, showoff that sparkler with pride.",
        "Buzz: What is this?",
        "Beth: Go ahead, Honey. Don't be shy. Did you not tell me that Coop proposed to you? Did you not show me a ring on your finger? Well, didn't you? Or was this just about hurting me? Is that what this was really all about?",
        "Lizzie: No. No.",
        "Beth: You have no respect for anyone, do you? Not me. Not your grandfather.",
        "Buzz: Oh, come on.",
        "Beth: Certainly not Coop and his family. You say that you've changed, but look at this. You haven't. Is this life? Is this love to you? Games and manipulation and getting exactly what you want?",
        "Coop: All right. All right. Enough, okay? This is not a game. Yes, Lizzie and I are in engaged.",
        "Buzz: What?!",
        "Coop: You heard me, Pops.",
        "Beth: Oh, Coop.",
        "Coop: Miss Spaulding, you need to stop, all right. You need to leave us alone. Your daughter Lizzie is the woman that I do want to marry. All right. And I'm not going to just stand here and watch you upset her and even hurt her.",

        "Olivia: Oh, come on. Your daddy and I just...",
        "Bill: What? What?",
        "Olivia: It's nothing. He doesn't mind.",
        "Bill: Well, I mind.",
        "Billy: No, no. Hey, she's got a point. I mean, I've been sober for ten years and I'm going to do everything I can to stay sober. We have a lot in common. I work hard to keep my hands off of booze. She works hard to keep her hands off of other guys. ( Laughter )",
        "Bill: Easy, Dad. That's my wife.",

        "Jonathan: ( Laughs )",
        "Ava: Ha-ha-ha.",
        "Jonathan: All right the truth is that, I haven't been here very long and I'm just trying to stay off the cops radar, okay?",
        "Ava: Don't worry your safe with me. And by the way, you know, I really do appreciate what you did for me. It says a lot about your personality.",
        "Jonathan: What is with people always trying to analyze me?",
        "Ava: It's because you're an easy target.",
        "Jonathan: Well... what were you asking me before?",
        "Ava: I was asking you how you make a good impression on someone?",
        "Jonathan: Oh, that's easy. You just kiss up to them.",
        "Ava: But I can't do that.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, you can. You just get them talking about themselves.",
        "Ava: You think it's as simple as that?",
        "Jonathan: Mm-hmm. People love to blow their own horn.",
        "Ava: Then why don't you?",

        "Ava: This Peter Burns guy, you'll take him.",
        "Olivia: Thanks.",
        "Ava: Yeah, no problem. I mean, hey, if you could handle the San Cristobal Harbor project, you can handle anything.",
        "Ava: You can handle anything. I mean that was such a tough one.",
        "Olivia: Do I know you?",
        "Ava: No. But I'm hoping to change that.",

        "Mel: We stabilized her, but she's lost a lot of blood.",
        "Danny: So what? You going to have to stop the bleeding, right?",
        "Mel: As fast as we can. It just depends on what we find.",
        "Rick: The O.R.'S all set up.",
        "Mel: Okay, great. There is another matter.",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Mel: Michelle's blood type.",
        "Rick: She's O negative.",

        "Mel: Thank you.",
        "Frank: And all you need to do is make a couple of calls, right?",

        "Michelle: I messed everything up.",
