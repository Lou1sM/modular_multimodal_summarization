    "Transcript": [
        "Phillip: You just made huge mistake. Breaking and entering in the middle of the day? What are you thinking?",
        "Harley: Phillip, I know i quit the force, but I think i know the law and this is not breaking and entering.",
        "Phillip: No?",
        "Harley: No. I was waiting to talk to you and I got tired of waiting in the hallway.",
        "Phillip: And you thought i was locked in that cabinet? No, you broke in hoping that you could find something to use against me. Something to keep me from going ahead with my plans for company. You know, I don't think I like that.",
        "Bill: Excuse me, you want to hear what I don't like?",
        "Tony: Hey. I thought you would have been gone already.",
        "Danny: There's a lot more to pack up than I thought.",
        "Tony: Listen, danny, all right, you don't have to leave, I told you that the other day when I bought the house, you know?",
        "Danny: I should be cleared out of here in a couple hours.",
        "Tony: This house is too big, man, we can share the place. I don't have to go.",
        "Danny: Tony, I'm not interested in sharing this house with you. And by the way, I'm not interesting in sharing my wife with you, either.",
        "Tammy: Michelle, hey. How are things going at the lighthouse. I can't wait until you open the restaurant.",
        "Michelle: It's definitely going to be cool. Even the renovation's been fun. We find all these things in nooks and crannies. You should come by sometime, I'll show you.",
        "Tammy: I'd love to.",
        "Michelle: I've got to go. Got to pick up some stuff at danny's house so catch you later.",
        "Tammy: Okay, bye.",
        "Blake: I know this is hard for you.",
        "Ross: And for you.",
        "Blake: Your face turned white as a sheet last night when you heard that dinah was arrested.",
        "Ross: I think it's safe to say that it was a shock for both of us.",
        "Blake: Well, it's difficult not to have a reaction when her name is mentioned.",
        "Ross: Although it's easier to take knowing dinah's in a jail cell.",
        "Blake: Maybe it's for the best... that dinah is back in springfield. Now she can face up to what she did to hart. Maybe we can all have a little closure.",
        "Tammy: Dinah's here?",
        "Edmund: You lured cassie to washington, D.C. And contrived a way to spend the night with her.",
        "Jeffrey: I didn't lure cassie anywhere. She followed me. Come on. Listen, nothing happened, okay?",
        "Edmund: This from the man who admitted having feelings for her? Mr. O'neill, you've put the lie to every claim you've made that you simply wanted to protect her.",
        "Jeffrey: I did want to protect her. And I still do.",
        "Edmund: Stop hiding, mr. O'neill. Admit it. You are in love with cassie, and you've been in love with cassie from the first moment you impersonated richard.",
        "Cassie: I've waited a long time for this.",
        "Dinah: Me, too. But maybe not for the same reasons you have.",
        "Cassie: You're not going to catch me off guard, dinah. I've spent a lot of time thinking about you and everything you did and I know you.",
        "Dinah: You didn't know I was going to be at the barn last night. It was a good thing I was. That was a nasty fire.",
        "Dinah: A fire that you probably set. It wouldn't be the first time. You know, it's so interesting being arrested when your father's the mayor. It's almost a circus watching the cops doing the processing...",
        "Cassie: Why are you telling me this?",
        "Dinah: Because I have a feeling that the officers in charge will be very upset when they realize that they forgot that I had this. (Female announcer)on the third day of her period,",
        "Tammy: How long has dinah been back? Who's seen her? Where is she?",
        "Ross: Tammy, she was arrested and she's being held at the police station.",
        "Blake: The barn caught fire in the barn was trapped in there.",
        "Ross: Dinah showed up and rescued him and got help for cassie. After that she was arrested for hart's murder.",
        "Tammy: Why didn't anybody call me?",
        "Blake: I think your mother and edmund want to tell you in person. Sweetie, let us drive you home.",
        "Ross: Brake, I should be getting back to the police station.",
        "Blake: Right. All right. I guess that means you have one chauffeur, okay?",
        "Ross: Give your... give my best to your mother.",
        "Blake: Listen, just keep telling yourself, \"dinah is in jail,\" all right? She cannot hurt you. She can't hurt anybody and that's where she's staying. She's staying in jail.",
        "Cassie: So what? Am I supposed to be scared stiff, dinah.",
        "Dinah: That would be the natural reaction. Officer? But my days of wanting to hurt you or anyone else are over. What's the problem?",
        "Dinah: I forgot to turn that in last night, I'm sorry. Back to your cell.",
        "Cassie: Wait, I have a few more questions I need to ask her. Please. I'll be watching.",
        "Cassie: Why didn't you use it?",
        "Dinah: I wanted to make a point.",
        "Cassie: You could have killed me if you felt like it?",
        "Dinah: That I didn't feel like it.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, okay. I see. So you saved rj's life and then you run inside and you tell jeffrey and edmund that I'm trapped in the fire so in a way you're saving my life, too, and now you pass up a golden opportunity to finish the job that you botched five years ago. Why?",
        "Dinah: I've been on the run for a very long time, cassie. And I've had lots of time to think about who I was when i pulled that trigger when I shot hart.",
        "Cassie: You tried killing me, dinah.",
        "Dinah: Yes, but I am not trying to do that anymore, am I?",
        "Cassie: You're the same person. You wouldn't know how to change.",
        "Dinah: Sorry to hear you say that, cassie.",
        "Cassie: You may be sorry you put that knife down.",
        "Edmund: You impersonated richard winslow in san cristobal and in europe and in an attempt to gather intelligence on suspected criminal activity on the island. Jeffrey:(Laughs) where did you come up with this gem edmund?",
        "Edmund: I made a few calls, mr. O'neill. Now that you're on leave from your agency, people are a little more willing to talk about you. Dinah marler is the one who was impersonating cassie. And she started impersonating cassie as part of your clandestine operation. You knew that dinah knew cassie and the way she behaved. So you enlisted her to go undercover with you. The only trouble was, as soon as the operation ended, dinah didn't end her little charade, which left you holding the bag and since you had started this whole thing to begin with, you had to protect yourself lest it come back to haunt you.",
        "Jeffrey: You'd think that you would have more to worry about with dinah back in town and everything that that implies.",
        "Edmund: Why? Was what does that this imply?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, just that it's going to be a very, very difficult time for cassie, that's all I meant. Why? What'd you think I meant?",
        "Dinah: I think she'd have a lot tougher time getting past the fact that you're the one that caused the fire that nearly killed arch.",
        "Jeffrey: From what I heard, last time dinah was back in town she caused major, major shock waves here. And now that she's back again, it's going to start all over again, especially since there's going to be a trial and guess who's going to be at the center of all the action? Cassie.",
        "Edmund: Will there be a trial? Is that your plan? Prosecute dinah?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, there's no statute of limitations on murder edmund. The trial is a no-brainer. It's automatic. Unless you had something else in mind.",
        "Phillip: The two of you are a team now, I see.",
        "Bill: Just when I'm walking down the hallway I hear a spaulding hassling someone, i come running, that's all.",
        "Phillip: How heroic. Your uncle josh and your dad must be so proud.",
        "Bill: You know, I don't know what you're up to your crazy loon, but I heard you talked shayne into giving up cross creek.",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Phillip: Yeah. Company, cross creek, what, this is business?",
        "Bill: No, it's personal. You're trying to get back at me for setting up shop with olivia. Phillip, I'm in business to make money not settle scores. But nobody wants to deal with me on those turns. You people have got to learn the golden rule.",
        "Bill: He who has the gold makes the rules, is that it?",
        "Phillip: Very good, junior. There may be hope for you. You may be brighter than the rest of the hillbillies.",
        "Harley: No, no, don't come on you guys. Please, I have a way to fix this if you can just let me talk, okay?",
        "Tony: I will not do this again, this whole thing about michelle again. I'm not going to do it.",
        "Danny: I don't know, maybe it will just go away, like I am.",
        "Michelle: What's going on, guys?",
        "Danny: Just filling tony in on some dos and don'ts about the house. Let me go load this on the truck. Excuse me.",
        "Tony: You know what? I've got to put this upstairs.",
        "Michelle: Do you know where arkville is? I heard it's like an hour north of here, a lot of antique and bric-a-brac shops.",
        "Tony: Well, no wonder where i don't know where it is.",
        "Michelle: I thought it might be a good place for us to pick up decorrations for light. Make a day trip. What do you say?",
        "Tony: Well, I don't know. Is that an invitation.",
        "Michelle: You are my partner. We can take your bike, you know?",
        "Tony: My bike? You can't put much on a bike.",
        "Michelle: We'll figure it out.",
        "Tony: All right. So when were you thinking of going? Tomorrow? When?",
        "Michelle: I don't know, let's keep it loose. I want to deal with moving out of here first.",
        "Tony: I'm up for it. Let me know, keep me updates.",
        "Michelle: I always do.",
        "Tony: Phone call. Got to take it. Hello?",
        "Michelle: It seems kind of rough on you.",
        "Danny: Michelle, it's just... it feels like we just moved in, you know, and then... you know, I thought this was it. I thought this was the place where we'd watch robbie grow up together and where we would....",
        "Michelle: Well, change isn't always such a bad thing. I mean, take this, for instance. This thing right here, this could have spent the next 50 years on this coffee table and now it might actually end up where it obviously belongs-- in a funeral home.",
        "Danny: Come on. I like that thing. I kind of like it.",
        "Michelle: You?",
        "Danny: Yeah, I do. Come on. Drop it. Give it to me. Come on, give it to me.",
        "Michelle: You don't seem so upset about your house anymore.",
        "Danny: What house?",
        "Danny: What does this mean?",
        "Michelle: What?",
        "Danny: This.",
        "Michelle: You wanted a kiss and it was good.",
        "Danny: Uh-huh.",
        "Michelle: That's enough.",
        "Danny: You know, it'S... it's good seeing you like this, so excited about the restaurant and the... you've got this glow.",
        "Michelle: What are you trying to tell me? The lighthouse got me all lit up?",
        "Danny: I'm enjoying seeing you like this.",
        "Michelle: You know, it's because of you. Because if you didn't pull those strings we would never have had that building permit. So thanks to you. We were just taking a break here.",
        "Tony: I see that.",
        "Harley: Okay, look, the problem here is that this whole situation has been allowed to spiral further and further away from any sort of compromise.",
        "Phillip: Compromise is highly overrated.",
        "Bill: Yeah, when you're the one sending in the bulldozers.",
        "Harley: I don't think that compromise is out of the question and I say that because I know you deep down phillip spaulding and I think there's a way to avert disaster if we all stay calm. Okay? I'm sure that we can come up with a solution that works for all of us.",
        "Phillip: Okay, let's explore.",
        "Harley: Thank you. Now, you are a businessman and businessmen are allowed to make a profit. We agree on that, right?",
        "Bill: Yeah. Yeah, sure.",
        "Harley: That's good. At least we're in sync on a major point here. But phillip, you have to acknowledge that cross creek and company are hotbed issues. Our families have strong feelings about those places. It makes it impossible for us to talk about it in dollars and cents.",
        "Phillip: I understand that.",
        "Harley: Now we're taking steps towards progress here.",
        "Phillip: And you think there's a deal we can make?",
        "Harley: Exactly. That's what I'm hoping for, yes.",
        "Phillip: Let's see. Obviously on my end I would give up my plans for company and cross creek. What would you do? What would you do to make that worth my while?",
        "Harley: I think I would rather hear what you need to make this work for you. There must be something you want.",
        "Phillip: Well, I can think of one thing that might make this deal work.",
        "Harley: Fabulous. What?",
        "Phillip: Give me our son.",
        "Edmund: You're the district attorney, mr. O'neill, surely you know whether the case against dinah marler is strong enough to merit a trial.",
        "Jeffrey: It's not that simple edmund.",
        "Edmund: Why not?",
        "Dinah: Jeffrey, you'd be the crazy one to keep me locked up like some little song bird because I will sing, but you won't like the tune.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm just thinking about cassie, how she was there the night of the shooting. It must have been terrible for her. But that does make her the key witness to the case, so if it does go to trial, she will be brought to the stand and forced to recount and relive every moment of that horrible night of the shooting. That's all I'm saying.",
        "Edmund: Most prosecutors will be chomping at the bit to put a known murderess behind bars.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, innocent until proven guilty.",
        "Tammy: Where's mom?",
        "Edmund: Tammy, she's sleeping.",
        "Blake: Listen, tammy knows everything.",
        "Tammy: Why didn't you call me.",
        "Edmund: Your mother thought it was better....",
        "Tammy: To tell me in person the monster of the world is back in town. She killed hart and she would have killed mom if she could have.",
        "Edmund: Just let her rest.",
        "Blake: She heard me talk to ross at the beacon. She heard everything.",
        "Edmund: How is ross with all this?",
        "Ross: How do you think? He's her father.",
        "Jeffrey: Not a great position for either of you to be in.",
        "Blake: I realize that she's my stepdaughter, but that woman murdered my brother and I want you to put her behind bars for good.",
        "Tammy: She's gone.",
        "Edmund: What?",
        "Tammy: Mom, she's not upstairs.",
        "Dinah: You have every right to be angry.",
        "Cassie: You think? Because you shot hart and n his own home, in n my home? And my little girl had to walk in there and see his body lying on the ground bleeding to death? That's a picture she'll have for the rest of her life and so i will. And R.J.? You know, he never even met his father.",
        "Dinah: I bet you wish you could have turned that knife on me.",
        "Cassie: No, no I don'T. You know why, dinah? That would be way too easy. I am looking forward to a nice long trial when you will finally get what you deserve: Life in prison. Who knows? Maybe you'll get the death penalty. I'll keep my fingers crossed for that one.",
        "Dinah: Well, so much for time healing one's wounds.",
        "Cassie: No, see, I have moved on with my life, okay? I have. And I have found love again, twice, in fact. I have a great family, I own my own business. Life is good. Now this will make it complete.",
        "Dinah: With sweet revenge added to the mix.",
        "Cassie: No, with justice. See, I moved on, dinah. I haven't forgotten. The memory of that night will always be... the sound of the shot, hart's body slumping to the floor. Hart's moan. See, it's not always in the front and center of my thoughts, it's kind of back in the corner of my mind, but it's there. I have not forgotten.",
        "Dinah: You shouldn't forget what's happened.",
        "Cassie: (Laughs) I'm not buying this act of yours, okay? I'm not. If you were so sorry, then why were you traipsing around europe pretending to be me and using my credit card? Huh? Because that doesn't sound to me like someone who's full of remorse, dinah.",
        "Dinah: The only reason why i took on your life was because mine was lost to me. After hart died, I had nothing.",
        "Cassie: That was your fault. You killed him!",
        "Dinah: I know that. Don't you think that's been eating at me every minute of every day since that night past? Cassie, being someone else was the only relief I had from becoming the person... I was pathetic the person I had become.",
        "Cassie: So you decide to become me?",
        "Dinah: It wasn't an obsession it was an escape, pure and simple.",
        "Cassie: There's nothing pure and simple about you, dinah.",
        "Dinah: I ended the life of the only man I ever loved. If I had the courage, I would have killed myself.",
        "Cassie: Why'd you save R.J.?",
        "Dinah: Am I that much of an ogre to you that you'd have to ask a question like that? You know I... I would love it if somehow me pulling R.J. Out of that fire could have evened things up between us. But I guess that would just be a fairy tale ending.",
        "Cassie: I stopped believing in fairy tales a long time ago.",
        "Dinah: Maybe this will be the one for you, you know? Me being arrested. Because now the system will take over and... I don't know, it's sort of a relief for me. I don't think that I was strong enough to face up to what I did on my own.",
        "Cassie: Let alone kill yourself.",
        "Dinah: Well, you finally got what you've been waiting for all this time: The trial, the sentencing. They'll throw me away and into prison or sentence me to death. You got it. So smile. You finally got that justice you've been after.",
        "Danny: Coming up on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Harley: Let me go. Let me go. I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you.",
        "Phillip: Where have I heard that before?",
        "Harley: I would bury you piece by piece before I gave you my child or my father's business.",
        "Cassie: Well, that was a very nice speech, but this isn't about justice for me, it's about what hart deserves. And the death penalty sounds just about right for what you did to him.",
        "Dinah: An eye for an eye, huh?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Even though you did save R.J. God, I wish that...",
        "Dinah: What? That you could have saved R.J. Yourself last night? Well, it would have knead a whole lot simpler, wouldn't it? I'm glad that R.J. Is okay.",
        "Ross: Cassie...",
        "Dinah: We're just catching up",
        "Ross: The officer in charge needs to finish up your processing, dinah.",
        "Dinah: Okay. We're done here. This way.",
        "Cassie: I'm sorry. I had to see her. I had to.",
        "Ross: Yes, you had to. Of course you did. Cassie, this is emotional for everybody involved and will probably stay that way for quite a while.",
        "Cassie: There's something to look forward to. I'm going back to the farm. Excuse me.",
        "Ross: Listen I... before you go, I need to ask you a favor. A big one.",
        "Edmund: Her car's not here.",
        "Tammy: Mom left without telling anybody?",
        "Blake: Is R.J. Okay?",
        "Tammy: He's upstairs asleep.",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie was spotted going to the police station.",
        "Edmund: I've got to get down there.",
        "Tammy: I'm going with you.",
        "Edmund: You know what I love ant you? You're just like your mother, you're strong, decisive, but please, it will just make things worse.",
        "Tammy: Dinah is the one who...",
        "Edmund: Tammy, please, just do this for me, all right? It's going to be all right. I promise.",
        "Harley: You want me to give you zach? How can you ask that?",
        "Phillip: Well, I didn'T. You pushed me into making a deal.",
        "Harley: You want zach, i don't believe this.",
        "Bill: I do.",
        "Phillip: Harley, you've been banging the drum for a half an hour.",
        "Harley: I don't see how giving my child away is any accomodation.",
        "Phillip: Technically you'll be giving him back.",
        "Harley: This is insane.",
        "Phillip: You can say no to the deal. I'm just trying to find a way to make that work.",
        "Harley: I don't see how this is you trying to make this work.",
        "Phillip: You give me zach full time to be raised by me as a spaulding in my home and I'll find a way to work around company. I'll build on three sides, use the airspace above, whatever.",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Phillip: Okay. I guess we're back to square one.",
        "Harley: I don't believe this. It's zach or nothing? What is he a poker chip?",
        "Phillip: It's really a shame. I was kind of warming to the idea. I just can'T... I can't think of anything else that you have that I want.",
        "Harley: God, I hate you! I hate you! I hate every inch of you!",
        "Phillip: Harley, please, please calm down. Boy, you coopers are... i thought I was the one that was supposed to be nuts. This is the reason buzz had a heart attack.",
        "Harley: Oh, my god! Oh, my god!",
        "Michelle: So this is roughly the layout here.",
        "Danny: And what's this?",
        "Michelle: This is the dining area here and then this is the bar and then these are separate satellite little areas for private parties and they each have their own little view of the lake.",
        "Danny: This is really good. It is really good. You came up with this?",
        "Michelle: You know it.",
        "Danny: Wow. I got to tell you, when I was coming up with the restaurant and putting together... this restaurant and club that I owned a couple years ago, victim used some ideas like this.",
        "Michelle: Well, you should have asked me, hon.",
        "Danny: Who knew you were such a genius?",
        "Michelle: Yeah, I have lots of good qualities.",
        "Tony: Listen, I found this box upstairs. Is it ready to go out? It's a big huge box?",
        "Michelle: In the bedroom? No, no, thanks for reminding me. I've got a lot more to put in there. I won't be long.",
        "Danny: Okay.",
        "Tony: The place is going to be nice, right?",
        "Danny: I didn't know me they will thought so visually.",
        "Tony: Before you know it, the joint will be packing people in every meal, you know?",
        "Danny: No doubt.",
        "Tony: I guess your plan worked.",
        "Danny: What plan, tony?",
        "Tony: Oh, I don't know. Michelle's dream comes true, she has you to be thankful for. You get what you wanted, you get what you wanted, right?",
        "Tammy: It's weird. Mom and edmund totally redid this place. I mean, it looks completely different than it used to. But it doesn't matter. That's where it happened. Right there. I don't think I'll ever forget that.",
        "Blake: Honey, why don't we go in another room, all right?",
        "Tammy: It sounded like a cannon when the gun went off, you know? That's how loud it seemed. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. He's your brother.",
        "Blake: You know what? That's all right. If you need talk about that, it's okay.",
        "Tammy: Hart was lying there with his eyes open at first. He was just staring, like he couldn't believe he had a bullet inside of him. There was so much blood.",
        "Blake: All right. You know, we shouldn't think about this right now, all right?",
        "Tammy: I try not to. Sometimes weeks go by when i don't, but then it is just right there again.",
        "Blake: Well, sometimes the past just... it needs to stay where it belongs: In the past.",
        "Tammy: I thought she was gone forever.",
        "Blake: She is. She is. She's behind bars.",
        "Tammy: Then why don't I feel any safer. She's, what, ten minutes away from here? I'll probably think about hart lying there everyday now.",
        "Blake: Come on.",
        "Tammy: Where?",
        "Blake: Edmund is wrong. You need to go to the police station. You need to see for yourself that dinah is behind bars and that she cannot harm you or your mother or anybody else that we care about.",
        "Tammy: Are you serious?",
        "Blake: Yes. Get your purse, come on.",
        "Ross: Cassie, my daughter faces a lifetime behind bars, or worse.",
        "Cassie: For murder?",
        "Ross: I don't know how to say this. I mean, it's not as if ihought it out.",
        "Cassie: Dinah killed hart, ross.",
        "Ross: Last night she saved R.J.'S life and most likely yours as well. I am not trying to put a price on the well-being of your son.",
        "Cassie: Then don'T. I think I see where this is going so you can stop right there.",
        "Ross: I can't stop. As an attorney, as a mayor i probably don't have any right to ask you for anything. But cassie, as a parent, as one parent to another, I am begging you to show some mercy.",
        "Cassie: I am not the judge or the jury. I'm not.",
        "Ross: You'll be the key witness and your testimony will be all important.",
        "Cassie: So you want me to lie on the stand? Or not testify at all? That s that what you're asking?",
        "Ross: I'm asking to consider how time has altered things. Dinah is not that girl who became obsessed with you all those years ago and let her delusions dictate everything that she did.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, so she says.",
        "Ross: And I believe her.",
        "Cassie: Because you think it's the truth or because you need it to be the truth?",
        "Ross: Maybe some of both. I don't know. But as her father, I have to hope for the best just like i have to ask you this.",
        "Cassie: Ross, ross you're such a good man and I know you're hurting and I know that my testimony could put dinah away for the rest of her life. But what if she goes free and he hurts someone else that I love? Am I willing to take that chance I don't think I am.",
        "Danny: Wait a minute. Hold on. Why do you think I helped michelle to get that building permit?",
        "Tony: Well, I would say to reel her back in.",
        "Danny: To reel her back in? She's my wife.",
        "Tony: She's your wife, I know that. But you don't know when she woke up from that coma she made her life about one thing, danny, being straight. Who she is, what she's feeling and what she's thinking.",
        "Danny: And?",
        "Tony: And the only thing she wanted in return from people was for them to be straight with her. Only you. You're the only one that can't do that.",
        "Danny: Okay. All right. You doe meant to what you're talking about.",
        "Tony: It scares you to death to know that michelle doesn't have the same connection with you that you do with her. I'm tired of seeing you working her down one side or the other.",
        "Danny: You're being completely honest about michelle. Especially about your feelings for her.",
        "Tony: You're jerking her around. You want her to love you. That's different. The permit, you got that so she'd be grateful to you.",
        "Danny: You just can't stand that you couldn't do it yourself.",
        "Tony: You think so?",
        "Michelle: So what's up? Tony right?",
        "Danny: About what?",
        "Michelle: Are you trying to buy me?",
        "Danny: Michelle, I don't know what you just heard.",
        "Michelle: I heard enough.",
        "Danny: Well did you hear the part where I said I love you?",
        "Michelle: Must have missed that part.",
        "Danny: You missed the best part.",
        "Michelle: Was this your idea from the beginning? Was it? About the permit?",
        "Danny: Are you serious?",
        "Michelle: I want to know how well thought out your gesture of support was? Did you go to the down, did you have them deny my permit so you could ride to the rescue, save the day like the big guy you are?",
        "Danny: No I knew you needed help....",
        "Michelle: Getting me to love you had nothing to do with it?",
        "Danny: Did I think that you might maybe appreciate that i helped you get the permit? Sure, who wouldn't? I'd be lying to you...",
        "Michelle: Just save it, danny. Just save it. Building this restaurant in the lighthouse was a dream for me. You come in, put your hands all over it and ruin it.",
        "Harley: Let me go! Let me go!",
        "Bill: It's not worth it.",
        "Harley: I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you. I would bury you piece by piece separately before I give you my child or my father's business.",
        "Phillip: I like this act, fit you go up and then she makes the peace then you flip- flop. Cute.",
        "Bill: We'll see how cute it is when she's going after your throat.",
        "Phillip: You're lucky i haven't called the police and have you arrested for harassment or breaking anentering or attempted battery. Unless you would like a longer record for the judge to look at when we review our custody agreement.",
        "Bill: Let him think he's won the battle, okay. You will win the war, I promise. Come on. Come on.",
        "Harley: Company is staying right where it.",
        "Phillip: Can't hear you. Pete, phillip spaulding. Yeah, listen, about the demolition of that dive, yeah, the burger joint, I want you to move up the schedule. That I want dump gone by lunch.",
        "Cassie: It's too late. I already saw her.",
        "Edmund: And?",
        "Cassie: It wasn't what i expected. I said everything that I wanted to say but there's more to the picture than I wanted to think.",
        "Jeffrey: Because of R.J.?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, because of R.J. And now ross wants me to take it easy on her and....",
        "Ross: I'm just asking for some compassion, that's all.",
        "Cassie: I don't think I have any compassion for dinah. Not after what she put hart through. Not after what she made tammy suffer through.",
        "Dinah: It's clear where cassie stands. I think I'm ready to make a statement now.",
        "Ross: Dinah, would you wait until your attorney gets here?",
        "Dinah: I've waited long enough, daddy, too long. Besides, there's a lot to tell, and what better time than now that everybody's here than to just let it all pour out.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "We're here to remove structure. The order came straight from phillip spaulding, ma'am.",
        "Harley: This is what I think of phillip spaulding.",
        "Edumnd: Are we okay?",
        "Cassie: No. We're going to make sure dinah get what is she deserves no matter what it takes."
