        "\r\nDanny: Yeah, well, he's... You know, he was a little resistant at first, but I\r\n\r\njust proved to him that he needed me. ",
        "\r\nBuzz: Must have been some recommendation. ",
        "\r\nDanny: No, I broke into his system and downloaded all of his files. ",

You were hiring him to do some consulting work for you on your \r\nshow, right? Why don't you tell me why you really hired him. ",

        "\r\nJosh: Into my company? ",
        "\r\nReva: Joshua, I know how hard you've worked to build up Lewis \r\nconstruction, and if there was something illegal going on, I just wanted to put\r\n\r\na stop to it... ",
        "\r\nJosh: You hired a private investigator to look into my business? ",
        "\r\nReva: Money was changing hands on the harbor project. I know it and so \r\ndid Cassie and Richard. ",
        "\r\nJosh: But instead of coming to me with your suspicions, you went off on \r\nsome half-cocked mission of truth? ",
        "\r\nReva: No, you're missing the point. I went after corruption and I found it...\r\n\r\nJosh: No, you're missing the point, Reva. If you had not hired Gus Aitoro, \r\nthere wouldn't be a photograph of me in the papers, telling people that I'm a\r\n\r\ncrook. ",
        "\r\nReva: Gus didn't plant that photo. ",
        "\r\nJosh: Then who did? ",

        "\r\nReva: The photo that turned up on television wasn't exactly the one I \r\nexpected. ",
        "\r\nJosh: So, you just accidentally ruined my career? ",
        "\r\nReva: I should have taken a closer look, but I really had the best of \r\nintentions. ",
        "\r\nJosh: Reva, I don't care about your intentions. If you had told me what \r\nyou were doing, if you had told me what you suspected, all of is could have \r\nbeen avoided. But instead, you acted without thought. You acted on impulse. ",
        "\r\nReva: No, I knew exactly what I was doing. Peter Vreeland was on the \r\ntake and I proved it. ",
        "\r\nJosh: You proved it by showing a picture of me giving him money. Reva, \r\nI've never given him a dime! ",

You never liked Olivia.\r\n\r\nYou hate the idea that we might be happy together, you always have. So, \r\nsince you couldn't get to us in another way, you're getting at us through our\r\n\r\nbusiness. ",
