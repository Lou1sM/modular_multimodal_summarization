        "\u00a0Tony: You wanted to talk to me? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Marah: I was sitting up on that\r\nbillboard looking over the whole town and i figured out a few things. I went up\r\nthere thinking I was going to save the world, but I ended up fighting out some\r\nthings that... That might save me. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Tony: Okay. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Marah: Tony, I was wrong about a lot of\r\nthings. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Tony: What kind of things? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Marah: You. I was wrong about you. \n\n",

        "\u00a0Gus: Hi. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Eden: I'm busy. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Gus: That's a real nice way to greet\r\nyour brother. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Eden: We've said everything we need to\r\nsay. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Gus: No, I think that you've said\r\neverything that you need to say and I'm just kind of getting started. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Eden: What are you doing here? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Gus: Well, I'm bored, you know. I don't\r\nreally have anybody creating any troubles for me in my life right now. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Eden: Yeah? Well, it is not my job to\r\nentertain you. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Gus: You see, something's missing out\r\nof my life. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Eden: Oh, really, what? Are you slow in\r\nbetween cases? Poor thing. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Gus: No. No, it's you. I miss my\r\nsister, and I'd really like to have her back, please. And I think that deep down\r\nin that heart of yours somewhere that you probably feel the same way. \n\n",
        "__________________________________________________\n\n",
        "\u00a0Edmund: Cassie? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Cassie: Hmm? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Edmund: R.J. doesn\u2019t start\r\nkindergarten for another week. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Cassie: I know. You saw him, he's so\r\nscared, and he\u2019s all freaked out about it. Poor little guy. And here I am\r\nacting like a complete baby. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Edmund: Well, I think you'll recover. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Cassie: Thanks to you. You know, there\r\nis something else you could do for me. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Edmund: What? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Cassie: I'm hungry. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Edmund: All right, let me get the\r\nphone. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Cassie: No, no, no, I want something\r\nsweet and there's some really yummy candy over there on the desk. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Edmund: Okay. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Cassie: Okay. I think I could get used\r\nto you waiting on me. Did you find it? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Edmund: I found this. \n\n",
        "________________________________________________\n\n",
        "\u00a0Harley: Let's just call it Lizzie's\r\nwild ride. \n\n",
        "> Olivia: It was that bad? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Harley: Because i love that kid, we\r\nmanaged. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Olivia: What's going to happen to her\r\nnow? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Harley: Well, Alexandra and Alan seem\r\nto think that it's nothing a little TLC. Won't cure. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Olivia: What do you think? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Harley: I think she needs professional\r\nhelp, like you said. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Olivia: You didn't mention my name, did\r\nyou? Because I kind of want to stay below the radar if you know what I mean? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Harley: Gotcha. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Rick: Hey. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Olivia: Did Phillip send you? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Rick: Well, hello to you, too. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Olivia: No, I\u2019m sorry. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Rick: Actually I'm filling in for dr.\r\nSedgwick. She's in delivery, but she did want me to pass on some good news. You\r\nget to go home today. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Olivia: I can't. I can't go home. \n\n",
        "__________________________________________________________\n\n",
        "\u00a0Cassie: Edmund, you don't think that\r\nthat\u2019s... This is... This is for Olivia. I can\u2019t... You know... I mean, not\r\nsince the accident. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Edmund: Cassie, I\u2019m... I don't know,\r\nI guess I want to remember those times as happening to other people. I... I\r\ncan't stand being the man who made all this happen to you. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Cassie: Yeah, well you're not that man\r\nanymore. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Edmund: Cassie, there's no chance,\r\nthere's no hope that... \n\n",
        "\u00a0Cassie: I have three beautiful\r\nchildren. I'm very lucky. If you were thinking about us, I mean, for the future,\r\nI... \n\n",
        "\u00a0Edmund: Cassie, i don't deserve, i\r\nhave... \n\n",
        "\u00a0Cassie: You know what, it's such a\r\nbeautiful day. Can we not do this? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Edmund: Cassie, you called it an\r\naccident it wasn't an accident. I'm the man responsible for you not being able\r\nto have children, the man responsible for your child dying. You just don't get\r\nover it that easily. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Cassie: I didn't say it was easy. I\r\nspent a long time hating you and blaming you, all right? It was an accident, all\r\nright? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Edmund: Cassie, it wasn't an accident. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Cassie: Look, I have a full life, I do.\r\nAll right. I have a full life. I'm happy, I have you, and I think this is\r\nabsolutely adorable, I do. And I think Olivia is going to love it, even though I\r\ndo see her baby as a Gucci baby, but Egan\u2019s didn't have that kind of stuff, so\r\nshe gets this. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Edmund: So you're collecting baby\r\nthings already? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Cassie: Well, it's a baby shower and\r\nI\u2019m the hostess, so... \n\n",
        "\u00a0Edmund: So what does that involve? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Cassie: Oh, lots of pink stuff, baby\r\noutfits, a lot of cue cucumber sandwiches, and a lot of games like pin the\r\nwheels on the baby carriage, you know. Basically your total nightmare. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Edmund: I can't imagine Olivia going\r\nfor any of that. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Cassie: I think she's going to love it.\r\n\n\n",
        "\u00a0Edmund: So does this mean you and\r\nOlivia is becoming friends? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Cassie: Friendlier. Friendlier. You\r\nknow, she's in a weird place right now and she needs someone, and I'm going to\r\ndo what I can. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Edmund: And you'll do it because you're\r\namazing. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Cassie: Yes, I am. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Edmund: Cassie, I just wish... \n\n",
        "\u00a0Cassie: Can you just let this go,\r\nplease? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Edmund: I don't know if i can. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Cassie: You have to. Okay? You have to.\r\n\n\n",
        "_________________________________________________________\n\n",
        "\u00a0Olivia: What are you doing here? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Phillip: I came to check on you and the\r\nbaby. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Olivia: Okay. Well, you know, we're\r\nfine, so you can go. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Rick: Okay. Well, as i was saying, you\r\nand the baby are doing fine, but you need to follow a couple of instructions\r\nhere, all right? No stress, no physical activity, and most importantly, no\r\nstress of any kind, do you understand? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Olivia: Yeah. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Rick: Okay, great. So who's taking you\r\nhome? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Phillip: I'll take her. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Harley: I'll take her home. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Phillip: That's all right. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Harley: Well, I was going to go to\r\nbeacon anyway to see Cassie, so... \n\n",
        "\u00a0Phillip: That's okay. I can take care\r\nof it. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Olivia: Thank you. I think that we\r\nshould talk, actually, so thanks and thank you for the good news. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Rick: You're welcome. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Harley: I'll take that as a cue, and if\r\nyou'll excuse us, I need to talk to dr. Bauer anyway. \n\n",
        "_________________________________________________________________\n\n",
        "\u00a0Rick: Okay. Remember, Olivia, no stress\r\nof any kind. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Phillip: Let's get you packed up. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Olivia: You know, i actually meant what\r\nI said before when I told you that I didn't want to see you. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Phillip: I heard you. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Olivia: Yeah? And? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Phillip: That was before. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Olivia: Before what? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Phillip: You were telling me the truth\r\nabout Lizzie. I know that now. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Olivia: I'm sorry. I didn't want it to\r\nturn out this way. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Phillip: I don't think anybody did. And\r\nyou're still afraid. Well, I promise that I will keep Lizzie away from you and\r\nthe baby. \n\n",
        "_____________________________________________________________\n\n",
        "\u00a0Gus: So, what are you doing with this\r\nthing? Sorry. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Eden: It\u2019s.. Do you mind? It's a\r\nsewing machine. It's got a needle and a thread and it sews two pieces of fabric\r\ntogether. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Gus: Yeah, I know what it is. I'm just\r\nsaying, what's it doing here? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Eden: I'm helping Marah out. She's\r\ndoing this fashion show and she's in a bind. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Gus: Since when do you sew? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Eden: Since forever. Remember our\r\nmom... I mean, my mom. Remember she used to sew. She would get those, like,\r\npatterns out of magazine so that she could make the cool clothes that all the\r\nkids in school wore that were cool and, you know, she knew it was important for\r\nme to dress like we came from the other side of the tracks and. I learned from\r\nher. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Gus: Yeah. Well, I kind of remember,\r\nyeah. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Eden: Yeah. I used to watch her all the\r\ntime. And, you know, when I got a little bit older and saw clothes in the window\r\nthat i loved and i couldn't afford, i felt like i deserved to have them, too, so\r\ni had a friend show me everything that i didn't know. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Gus: It's just that I never would have\r\nsaid that you were the... You know, so... \n\n",
        "\u00a0Eden: Honest and hardworking? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Gus: No, I was going to say domestic. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Eden: I think you're confusing making\r\nup with me with making fun of me. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Gus: Oh, come on. I... Haven't I always\r\nbeen able to tease you? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Eden: Yeah, but you tearing me down, it\r\ndoesn't feel very good. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Gus: I'M... I'm... I didn't mean it\r\nlike that. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Eden: Well, that's the way it felt. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Gus: So you and Marah are friends? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Eden: Yeah. I introduced her to the\r\ndesigner that she's working with. See, I can do nice things, too. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Gus: So you sew for her and you get\r\nwhat in return? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Eden: Friendship. Is there anything\r\nwrong with that? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Gus: You don't have to be so defensive.\r\nI'm just asking you a question. I mean, I do know you pretty much better than\r\nanybody in the world, and it's not like you weren't after her boyfriend for an\r\nentire year and now you're sewing for her. What, does somebody have a guilty\r\nconscience? \n\n",
        "_________________________________________________________\n\n",
        "\u00a0Tony: Marah, you shouldn't have a\r\nguilty conscience. You didn't do anything wrong. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Marah: Can you just hear me out? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Tony: It's not going to change\r\nanything. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Marah: Okay, then it won't hurt to just\r\nlisten. Look, when we first moved into the museum i... I felt like i was so\r\ngrown-up, you know, like i had moved out of my childhood. But after everything\r\nthat happened with Ben it... I felt like the bottom had dropped out from\r\nunderneath me so I... I ran home. And my old room was, like, the only place in\r\nthe whole world that I really felt safe. I should have turned to you, but I was\r\njust... I was so scared, you know. I didn't know what to do. I was more scared\r\nthan I had been in such a long time. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Tony: Probably not since that time that\r\nI hurt you. Well, it's not a question about being grown-up. There are some\r\nthings in life that you should never have to experience. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Marah: But I believe in forgiveness. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Tony: It's not about what you believe;\r\nit's about what you feel. Now, you were scared to be with me, and you were right\r\nto be. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Marah: What I was feeling wasn't real;\r\nit was just a reaction to everything. It was... It was like a flight reflex. I\r\nran scared when I should have run to you. And if those pictures hadn't shown up\r\nafter everything with Ben, I probably would have reacted differently. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Tony: Oh, yeah? Even if the pictures\r\nwere real? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Marah: They weren't. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Tony: Yeah, but what if they were.\r\nWould you be standing here right now? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Marah: Tony, eventually i would have\r\ncome to my senses and realized that they were from a past that doesn't matter. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Tony: But it does matter, Marah.\r\nListen, you were right to walk away from me. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Marah: I've hurt you so much that\r\nI\u2019ve got you believing the stuff that I was wrong about. Tony, you are good\r\nfor me, okay? And it took me going up on that billboard to realize that. For the\r\nfirst time, after everything, I felt happy when i was up there. I literally felt\r\nlike I was on top of the world and... And the first thing that came to my mind\r\nwas, \"gosh, you know, I wish Tony was here to experience this with me. He\r\nwould love this.\" \n\n",
        "\u00a0Tony: I can't... \n\n",
        "\u00a0Marah: And then everything started\r\ncoming back to me. The way we were and how good we were together, Tony, and how\r\nhappy we were. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Tony: I can't. I can't take this. I\r\ncan't take you apologizing to me right now. It's not right, okay? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Marah: You turned your whole world\r\naround for me and I let you down, okay? I didn't have faith in you when i should\r\nhave, but I can make that up to you now. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Tony: You know what, Marah? It was good\r\nseeing you. I should get going. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Marah: No, Tony I love you and you love\r\nme, okay. I want us to be happy again. I know that you want that, too. \n\n",
        "___________________________________________________________\n\n",
        "\u00a0Phillip: Everybody told me there was a\r\nproblem-- you, Lillian, Beth, everybody. And I didn't see how far out on the\r\nledge she was until she damn near jumped off it. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Olivia: I'm sorry it had to get to that\r\npoint. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Phillip: She just had so much pain in\r\nher life. But she always seemed somehow like she was bouncing back from it. But\r\nshe wasn't. She was just absorbing the blows. And now she\u2019s... \n\n",
        "\u00a0Olivia: TKO? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Phillip: No, she's down. But she's\r\ngoing to beat this. I was just talking to dr. Boudreaux and I... I didn't\r\nrealize how much she had riding on Beth and me getting back together. And when\r\nthat didn't happen, it was just too much for her. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Olivia: Yet in her mind the baby and I\r\nwere what stood in the way of that. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Phillip: Yeah, but that's... No. I'M...\r\nI'm what am in the way, because I'm the one that she's angry with. I didn't\r\nfight hard enough to keep our family together. But, see, she can't express that\r\nanger, because if she does, she's afraid she'll lose me. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Olivia: But she's feels safe to go\r\nafter me, so... \n\n",
        "\u00a0Phillip: Look, you know i did not want\r\nyou to end up in the middle of this, but you don\u2019t... This is not something\r\nthat you have to worry about anymore. You don't have to be afraid of her \n\n",
        "\u00a0Olivia: Come on come on. Just because\r\nyou know that's there's a problem now doesn't solve anything. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Phillip: I know that. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Olivia: So what's next? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Phillip: Well, we considered\r\nhospitalization. Lillian and Beth were fairly determined on that course, but\r\nwe're going to try something else. We're going to do intensive therapy. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Olivia: Intensive therapy. Umm, what\r\nhappens when she's not in therapy? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Phillip: She's with me or Beth or\r\nLillian, or she's in school. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Olivia: Uh-huh. So, it's house arrest. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Phillip: Yeah, sort of. But maybe\r\nthat's what she needs right now. Because most... Most of the problems that she\r\nhas seem to come from feeling abandoned, and if we can show her that we're going\r\nto be with her every step of the way, maybe that will make her understand that\r\nshe's not alone, and make her understand that we care enough about her to do\r\nwhatever we have to, even if it means protecting her from herself until she can\r\ntake care of herself again. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Olivia: See, I'M... I'm starting to\r\nrealize how hard it is to make good choices for your children, you know, to do\r\nwhat's best for them. Because that's all I think about these days, protecting\r\nthis one. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Phillip: I would lay down my life to\r\nprotect any of my children. That child that you're carrying is mine. I will\r\nnever let anything hurt her. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Olivia: I really want to believe that. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Phillip: Believe it. (Sighs) you ready\r\nto go? \n\n",
        "\u00a0Olivia: Yeah. \n\n",
        "____________________________________________________________\n\n",
        "\u00a0Eden: You are always going to look at\r\nme like I'm that little girl on that roof, aren't you? But you know what, I am\r\nnot her anymore. I'm not. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Gus: I took you up on the roof, I just\r\nasked you some questions. I mean, I know I went a little too far, I went a\r\nlittle crazy, but it's in the past. Please, let's just move on. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Eden: Oh, what, until the next time\r\nthat you have a murder case that you can't solve and then you've got to go haul\r\nme in. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Gus: There was a serial killer out\r\nthere. You know, I mean, I was under a lot of pressure. I had the D.A.'S office\r\nall over me I had the chief. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Eden: Oh, right so you needed to lean\r\non me. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Gus: Yeah, exactly. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Eden: Well, the only thing is, what you\r\ndid to me, you went above and beyond if call of duty because it was personal. \n\n",
        "\u00a0Gus: Yeah, it was personal. You're my\r\nsister. I needed... What else could i do? \n\n",
