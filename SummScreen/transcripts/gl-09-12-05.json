        "Alexandra: There's a little time problem, however. I think the minister said he had other appointments.",
        "Lizzie: How long does a wedding take? \"I do,\" \"I do,\" it's done.",
        "Alexandra: You have to leave enough time to explain to the young man he's invited to his own wedding.",

        "Jeffrey: I'm always here? Are you trying to tell me something?",
        "Cassie: No, I love having you here. I do. I just don't think you should be on baby duty around the clock. You're Jeffrey O'Neill, you need to have fun, right? So band rehearsal, don't you have a job, come on.",
        "Jeffrey: A job? Yeah, I've got a job. You're throwing me out?",

        "Cassie: Wow. What has happened to you, O'Neill?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you told me to go out and have some fun. My idea of having fun is actually to be right here with you and the baby and the kids, okay? It's... it's sad, isn't it?",
        "Cassie: It's pathetic, really.",
        "Jeffrey: It is, isn't it?",

        "Edmund: How much of that wine have you had?",
        "Dinah: Not a drop. It's for us. And, yes, there is still an us, Edmund. I thought we worked pretty well. Speaking of which, working or not, heads up. You haven't said a word, what do you think?",
        "Edmund: I think you've lost your mind.",
        "Dinah: Now why? Why would I fight you? I finally got what I wanted. The farmhouse with you. And all you have to do is just give in and embrace the monster.",

        "Marina: Take your time.",
        "Danny: Okay.",

        "Marina: I don't.",

        "Marina: Really?",
        "Michelle: I guess it's a memory.",
        "Marina: You think that Danny was there at the crash. You think that he helped you deliver the baby. He told me. But Danny was with me when it happened.",
        "Michelle: I know. I know. So I guess I imagined it. It just seemed so real, you know? It just... I know it doesn't make any sense, but I still feel my baby, you know? I can hear her cry. I feel these strong hands pulling her from me. I just... I feel it. I still feel her. Am I just crazy, Marina? Am I crazy?",

        "Danny: Yeah, I've been once or twice.",
        "Ray: Did it help?",
        "Danny: I don't know. I don't know what to feel. I can't really cry for a baby I didn't know about.",
        "Ray: Oh, but you can. We're all grieving. That baby would have been the last connection to my baby brother.",
        "Danny: Yeah. Or it could have been mine. We'll never know. Marina said that you wanted to ask me something.",
        "Ray: I thought maybe you and Michelle wanted to have some small service for the baby.",
        "Danny: I'll ask her.",
        "Ray: It'll help. To mourn what you've lost... might have been.",
        "Danny: What do you mean? If the baby were mine? If the baby lived? Is that what you're saying?",
        "Ray: What if she was? What if she did? What would you have done?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: I shouldn't even be talking to you about this. I'm sorry.",
        "Marina: No. No, say what you need to say and feel what you need to feel.",
        "Michelle: I saw my mother, Marina.",
        "Marina: What?",
        "Michelle: After I got here and they thought they were losing me, I saw her.",
        "Marina: Did she talk to you? Did she say anything?",
        "Michelle: She told me it wasn't my time yet. And she said that I needed to hold on to hope.",
        "Marina: Hope for what?",
        "Michelle: For the future, I guess.",
        "Marina: When you had your hallucination and you thought you saw Danny at the crash, did he say anything to you about the baby?",
        "Michelle: Why are you asking me that? I mean, why would you want to know that?",
        "Marina: I don't know. I guess I just thought maybe it might help you. But forget I even asked.",

        "Dinah: I schemed, I prayed to have a life with you, and all I have to do is really give in and just let there be happiness. This is the first day of the rest of our lives.",
        "Edmund: Your life.",
        "Dinah: Our lives. You hold the keys to both my heart and that door. I don't have my freedom, but I have you. And Cassie has Jeffrey. But the difference is I'm everything you're going to need. I can be everything to you in a thousand different ways.",

        "Edmund: And sadly for you, Dinah, you have nothing I'm interested in. Cassie and Jeffrey will be history shortly. I'll see to that. And besides, now I have Hope in my life.",
        "Dinah: Well, whatever. I'm just saying if things don't come around the way that you expected them too, you could have me to come home to.",
        "Edmund: Home?",
        "Dinah: Well, yeah. Now that you don't have Princess Cassie, you have me, the next best thing. Princess Me.",

        "Lizzie: My mom set you up.",
        "Coop: Now, Lizzie, come on. I know I'm not your mom's most favorite person in the world, but do you really think that she would try and kill me? Especially over a little vacation like this?",
        "Harley: Lizzie, do you really think your mother would rig some tires to fall and break a gas pipe?",
        "Lizzie: Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but...",
        "Gus: It doesn't sound like something that your mother would do.",

        "Harley: Yeah.",
        "Alexandra: Well, you know what? Everyone's back sound and safe. I mean... you know... hurray, hurray. Why don't we all just go grab something to eat? Away from here. Please. You know, we could clear our heads...",
        "Gus: Yeah. No. I was going to... I think I should go by the prison and say hello to my father and congratulate him on being married.",
        "Harley: Yeah, find out if Alan or Beth was involved in this.",
        "Gus: Okay. I'll get some answers.",
        "Harley: And the two of you... don't do anything, okay. Stay away from each other until we find out whether this accident was really an accident. I'm not kidding. Do what I tell you.",

        "Dinah: You gave Cassie your heart, your soul, her dream house. Even a child. And that was not enough to get her to give up Jeffrey O'Neill. So why don't you face it, Eddie. You are royally screwed.",
        "Edmund: Just like you, Dinah. Jeffrey O'Neill is living on borrowed time.",
        "Dinah: And he's enjoying every single minute of that. Why don't I tell you a little story. It's about a farmhouse. Looks exactly like this. Not too far away. You have Princess Cassie and Jeffrey, her knight, snuggling there with their child... your child. And oh, where's the pathetic prince? He's missing. And would you believe no one even misses him?",
        "Edmund: That's it, Dinah. End of story. End of fairytale. And I promise you that one will not be coming true.",
        "Dinah: How could it... when Jeffrey is living on borrowed time, right? You're no closer to Cassie now than on the day she tossed you out or you wouldn't be here.",
        "Edmund: Well, keep on believing that, Dinah. In the meantime...",

        "Cassie: Yeah. Quiet.",
        "Jeffrey: She's a good sleeper huh?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. For now. But soon she'll be up all the time and then there's so much to do while she's napping. Cooking, cleaning.",
