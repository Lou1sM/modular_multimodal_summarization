        "Coop: It's nothing ",
        "Ava: Right here, what is that? ",
        "Coop: It's just a paper-- no, Ava, look-- ",
        "Ava: Let me see. \"Local toddler ingests\r\nperfume. Negligent babysitter responsible\"? Oh, my gosh! I hope they didn't put my name is this. \r\n",
        "Coop: No, they didn\u2019t. Olivia managed to use\r\nsome control. ",
        "Ava: Olivia? ",
        "Coop: Look, Ava, Olivia is apparently trying\r\nto hurt you any possible way she can, right? Unfortunately, my dad is not doing\r\nanything. He's just letting it happen. ",
        "",
        "Marina: So yes or no? ",
        "Mallet: Yes or no what? ",
        "Marina: The bet. Are we on? Ten bucks says is behind the\r\nbounty of this mysterious blogger. ",
        "Mallet: You want to bet ten bucks on a\r\n$100,000 bounty? ",
        "Marina: Hey, ten bucks is like a gallon of gas. ",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I know that's true. ",
        "Marina: Besides, someone put this web cam in Alan-Michael's\r\nroom. Wouldn't you want to find out who did it? ",
        "Mallet: No, I want to find out who's behind\r\nthe website because they've hurt a lot of people. ",
        "Marina: Like you and Dinah? Come on, ten bucks. ",
        "Mallet: Okay, okay, I'll take the bet, but\r\nyou know what? I want a little honesty in return. ",
        "Marina: Honesty about what? ",
        "Mallet: I want to know why you're so suddenly\r\neager to focus your investigation on Alan-Michael. I want to know is this visit\r\nofficial, or are we crossing over into personal territory here? ",

        "Harley: I need to talk to Dinah,\r\ndo you know where she is? ",
        "Jeffrey: As a matter of fact, I do. She's at\r\nOutskirts working on behalf of the O\u2019Neill for mayor campaign. ",
        "Harley: What is she your campaign manager\r\nnow? ",
        "Jeffrey: No, nothing that official. She's\r\njust helping me out, that's all. ",
        "Harley: Really? What kind of help? ",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Who's asking, you or your\r\nmutual ex? ",
        "Harley: Just answer the question. ",
        "Jeffrey: My relationship with Dinah is\r\nstrictly platonic. So you can tell Detective Mallet that we'd appreciate it if\r\nhe left us alone because we have a lot of work to do. Besides, she's over him. \r\n",

        "Remy: I'm sure he will. ",
        "Ashlee: Is it true, Tammy? Did Jonathan\r\nreally marry Lizzie? ",
        "Tammy: I was her maid of honor. ",
        "Ashlee: My gosh,\r\nyou poor thing, how could you stand up there and go through with it? You must\r\nbe devastated. ",
        "Tammy: Jonathan had to do what was right for\r\nhis baby. He wants her to have a real family, so that means-- ",
        "Ashlee: Yeah, that means you got the axe,\r\nand Lizzie got what she wanted all along. Jonathan. What? Lizzie has had a\r\nthing for him a while now, you didn't know? ",

        "",
        "Ava: It's not really Buzz's fault. ",
        "Coop: I just wish that whatever it was, he\r\nwould take Olivia and he would control her a little bit. That is all. ",
        "Ava: I'm sure that's what he wants you to do\r\nwith me, control a girl who's going to \"recklessly endangered the welfare\r\nof a child.\" ",
        "Coop: All right, stop. All\r\nright. Buzz is crazy about you. He knows what happened with Emma is\r\ncompletely an accident, and not your fault. ",
        "Ava: Sure. ",
        "Coop: Hey, look. We're going to get to the\r\nbottom of this, okay? I promise. ",
        "Ava: I know. Now I better get back to work\r\nbefore Alan-Michael docks my pay. ",
        "Coop: Docks your pay? Alan-Michael should be\r\npaying you double for the late hours you're having to\r\nkeep. ",
        "Ava: Yeah, right. So, how do I look? ",
        "Coop: Ava, you look beautiful as always. ",
        "Ava: Thank you. I can't really afford any\r\nnew clothes until I get paid. I just sort of have to rotate everything in my\r\ncloset. I hope Alan-Michael doesn't notice. ",
        "Coop: I have a feeling that Alan-Michael\r\ndoesn't notice the clothes until he is taking them off. Here you go. ",
        "Ava: You are so bad. I'll see you tonight.\r\nOkay, I'll see you later. ",

        "Harley: Oh, yeah, I hear that Blake is\r\nout-raising you two to one. ",
        "Jeffrey: Well she's also outspending me two\r\nto one. She thinks that buying new shoes is a legitimate campaign expense. \r\n",
        "Harley: So you know about Blake\u2019s shoe\r\nfetish-- interesting. ",
        "Dinah: So then the guy said, if you help me find my car keys, we can drive out of here.\r\n(Laughter) ",
