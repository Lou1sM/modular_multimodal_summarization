        "Harley: Phillip Spaulding, Phillip Spaulding, he thinks he can have whatever he wants, whenever he wants it--including our son.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, I can't wait to see him crash and burn. That's it. (Cell phone rings) It's Ross.",
        "Harley: Maybe he granted our petition to stay the demolition.",
        "Bill: Hello? Ross, what's up?",
        "Ross: Bill, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Dinah has been arrested.",
        "Bill: Uh, well, where are you?",
        "Ross: At the police station, but don't come down here just yet. Things are still a bit tense.",
        "Bill: Are you sure?",
        "Ross: I'll get a hold of you when I know more.",
        "Bill: All right, well, in the meantime could you tell Dinah to hang in there? Thanks.",
        "Harley: Dinah? What about Dinah?",
        "Bill: Well, she's been arrested. She's in jail.",
        "Harley: Here in Springfield? In town? How long has she been in town?",
        "Bill: I don't know. Ross didn't say.",
        "Harley: Does Cassie know this? I've got to call Cassie and let her know she's here.",
        "Foreman: Where can I find the owner?",
        "Harley: I'm his daughter. What do you want?",
        "Foreman: We're here to remove the structure.",
        "Harley: Like hell you are.",
        "Foreman: The order came straight from Phillip Spaulding, ma'am.",
        "Harley: Yeah, well this is what I think of Phillip Spaulding, okay? Let me tell you something about Phillip Spaulding: He put my father in the hospital. And unless you want to join him, I'd recommend you get out of here. Bill?",
        "Bill: You heard the lady.",
        "Harley: Out. Out. Get out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lillian: Oh, Buzz, you are going to be so happy. Rick said you can be sprung tomorrow. You get to go home.",
        "Buzz: Home? My home for all of a few days, until the wrecking ball comes. Phillip is your family. Talk some sense into him.",
        "Lillian: Do you think I haven't tried? And I'll try again you know I will. But you can't think about Phillip. You have to rest, for your heart. No stress, no confrontation.",
        "Frank: You know what, Dad? Lillian is absolutely right. Don't worry about Phillip. We'll handle it.",
        "Coop: Don't worry about it. We've got the strength to deal with him.",
        "Buzz: Like I'm too weak.",
        "Coop: No, that's not what I said.",
        "Buzz: Too old.",
        "Coop: No. Pop, what I'm just saying is that you've earned yourself some rest.",
        "Buzz: Like an old horse who's put out to pasture.",
        "Marina: Grandpa that is not what Coop meant.",
        "Buzz: Step back, the lot of you.",
        "Frank: Come on, pop.",
        "Buzz: I mean it.",
        "Lillian: What do you think you're doing Buzz?",
        "Buzz: What does it look like I'm doing? I'm getting out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Hey, Father Ray.",
        "Ray: Hey, Sandy. Thanks for meeting me over here. I had a little problem with one of my parishioners.",
        "Sandy: Oh, well, it's early.",
        "Ray: Poor guy needed a little help getting out of this place.",
        "Sandy: Well... yeah, you're already hard at work. You are on call, though, right?",
        "Ray: Kind of. So, what's up? You said this had something to do with the \"Rock the Vote\" campaign?",
        "Sandy: Oh, yes, sir. Thanks for coming. I had an idea and knowing how involved you are in getting kids registered to vote, I wanted to run it by you.",
        "Ray: That's great. \"Rock the Vote\" is my pet project these days. You know, I work with so many kids, I see how disenchanted they are with the world, how little they think they can do to change what's wrong, keep what's right. Voting is a way for them to make a difference. If I can just find a way to make them realize how easy it is for them to register, to vote. How much their one vote counts. It can make all the difference in the world. I literally drive kids all over town to get them to voter registration areas. I'm spent.",
        "Sandy: Wow. You should probably pitch my idea to the big boss man. He isn't exactly into helping the little folks these days, you know?",
        "Phillip: Well, you never know until you try.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: (Muffled yell)",
        "Danny: You staged that argument, Tony. You wanted Michelle to think that I got the permit to the lighthouse just to manipulate her.",
        "Tony: Danny, I wanted Michelle to see the truth and now she does.",
        "Danny: The truth?",
        "Tony: Finish packing and be gone when I get back, all right?",
        "Michelle: (Yells)",
        "Tony: You should never have attacked Michelle.",
        "Danny: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Tony! Stop it!",
        "Tony: He's attacking her!",
        "Michelle: He's getting away!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: So, what do you think Dinah is going to say? Think she's going to confess? Reveal some deep, dark secret?",
        "Edmund: Don't listen to a word that woman says, Cassie. She only wants to hurt you.",
        "Cassie: But I have to hear it.",
        "Tammy: Mom.",
        "Cassie: Honey? What are you doing here? She shouldn't be here. You don't need to be here.",
        "Tammy: I needed to know. I needed to see.",
        "Blake: Cassie, we all need some closure.",
        "Tammy: Are you okay? I heard about the fire. If Edmund hadn't saved Jeffrey and rescued you...",
        "Cassie: We're okay. We're okay. And Dinah can't hurt us, all right? She can't hurt us. Tammy, she is the one that got RJ out of the fire.",
        "Tammy: What? Why?",
        "Cassie: I don't know. I don't know.",
        "Blake: Cassie, why is she here? How long has she been here? I mean has nobody seen her? Ross.",
        "Ross: What are you doing here?",
        "Blake: I changed my mind. I needed to be here. I wanted to make sure that Dinah got what was coming to her. Look, I'm sorry. I realize that she's your daughter. But Hart was my brother.",
        "Dinah: Well, look at this. The gang's all here.",
        "Ross: Counselor, Dinah is not going to say anything. Not until she's had a lengthy conversation with her attorney.",
        "Blake: If she wants to speak, let her say something.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, this can only go badly. Why don't I take the two of you home?",
        "Cassie: I need to be here, Edmund, for my own peace of mind, and for Hart.",
        "Tammy: Same here.",
        "Cassie: No. No, no, no. You don't, honey. You went through something very traumatic. I don't want you dredging all that up.",
        "Tammy: If you can handle it, Mom, I can handle it.",
        "Edmund: Your mother may be right, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: I'm staying.",
        "Ross: Dinah, in this atmosphere, you are not going to get a fair hearing.",
        "Blake: If she wanted a fair hearing, she should have stuck around after she killed Hart instead of running away like the coward that she is. What? What are you looking at?",
        "Edmund: Look, Ms. Marler, we're very grateful that you saved RJ, but I think it's time we all let the legal process run its course and not cause anyone else any more pain.",
        "Dinah: I don't want to cause any more pain. I'd like to end it.",
        "Ross: Dinah please, don't.",
        "Blake: Let her talk.",
        "Ross: Jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: Ms. Marler has been read her rights. If she wants to make a statement against the advice of counsel, I can't stop her. However, I would suggest...",
        "Dinah: Thank you, Mr. O'Neill. Thank you. But I do wish to make a statement. And I'd like to begin by thanking all of you for being here. I know it must be difficult to see me right now and be reminded of a very painful time for all of us, a time that I wish I could go back and change, but unfortunately I can't. None of us can change the mistakes we've made. All we can do now is admit them and pray for understanding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: I can't believe you let that guy get away!",
        "Danny: I misunderstood, okay?",
        "Michelle: How can you misunderstand? Does Tony normally go around beating strangers to a pulp for no reason?",
        "Danny: Do you really want me to answer that? Come on.",
        "Michelle: Well, maybe they deserve it.",
        "Danny: Michelle, it was an honest mistake. How could I know?",
        "Tony: Hey, hey. At least you weren't hurt, okay, Michelle? Danny, she wasn't hurt. He didn't get what he wanted. The good thing is, we know what he looks like.",
        "Michelle: What did he want? He had to be related to those guys who ransacked the lighthouse.",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Michelle: I told you. Two guys broke into the lighthouse the other day.",
        "Danny: You told me that you were making that up, that it didn't happen.",
        "Michelle: I lied.",
        "Danny: Michelle... you knew about this?",
        "Tony: I was with her, yeah. We walked in on them.",
        "Danny: Well, who are these guys? Did they seem like pros to you?",
        "Michelle: You can talk to me, all right? You don't have to talk to Tony on my behalf. I can take care of myself.",
        "Danny: Yeah. What if you're wrong about that, Michelle?",
        "Michelle: Then I'll eat crow and I'll come groveling back to you begging for your help. Will that make you feel better?",
        "Danny: No. What will make me feel better is if you're safe.",
        "Michelle: I can't deal with this. I cannot deal with this. I'm just going to pack up my stuff and then we're going to go our separate ways.",
        "Tony: You need... you need help, Michelle, putting this stuff in the car?",
        "Michelle: No, I can manage on my own.",
        "Tony: Okay. Well, then I'm going to go make a call and see if I can get a lead on this guy, all right? Danny, lock the door when you leave.",
        "Michelle: Don't be mad at him. He didn't do anything wrong.",
        "Danny: What? What's the matter? Did you get hurt?",
        "Michelle: I fell down in the driveway when I was running after him.",
        "Danny: Let me see.",
        "Michelle: No, I'm fine.",
        "Danny: Let me see.",
        "Michelle: I am fine.",
        "Danny: Michelle, let me see.",
        "Michelle: There. See?",
        "Danny: Sit down. Sit.",
        "Michelle: It is fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: So, what I'm saying is we have so much power in the media to do good that it would be a shame if WSPR didn't help promote \"Rock the Vote.\" Empowering our youth to vote will help shape the future of this country.",
        "Phillip: Well, that's a very admirable goal, Sandy, considering that you can't even vote in this country yet.",
        "Sandy: Well, I intend on being a citizen by the next election. And issues like health care, jobs, education, the environment, they affect my future, too.",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ray: So, what do you say, Mr. Spaulding? Is WSPR ready to \"Rock the Vote?\"",
        "Phillip: Get out of here. Go write up some of these ideas. Have them on my desk by the end of the day.",
        "Sandy: Thank you, Phillip. Thank you, Father Ray. You won't regret this.",
        "Ray: Good decision. He's right you won't regret it.",
        "Phillip: Oh, I don't plan to. It's outstanding publicity. (Laughs) Oh, father. I have four children. I care very much about the future of young people. It plays a major role in my decision-making these days. It's what's behind a lot of the choices that I'm making, trying to create something in this town. It's for that next generation of children.",
        "Ray: If you ever feel conflicted about those choices, I'm always available to listen. Even to a non-parishioner.",
        "Phillip: Well, thank you. I appreciate the offer, but, you know, the one thing that I am not these days is conflicted.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Well, don't just stand there. Help me up.",
        "Frank: You know, Dad, I don't think this is a very good idea.",
        "Marina: Lillian, you want him to stay in the hospital another 24 hours, right?",
        "Lillian: Well, we'd prefer it. Buzz?",
        "Buzz: Don't take that tone with me.",
        "Lillian: Buzz.",
        "Buzz: What?",
        "Lillian: Tomorrow, you will go home as we planned. (Cell phone rings)",
        "Frank: Lillian, I know I'm not allowed to take phone calls here, but can I take this please?",
        "Lillian: Just this once.",
        "Frank: Thanks.",
        "Lillian: What a family.",
        "Frank: Cooper here.",
        "Harley: Frank, I'm at Company. The bulldozers are here.",
        "Frank: What?",
        "Harley: The bulldozers, Phillip's bulldozers. They're here and they're early. Now, I've got Bill Lewis with me and he and I are doing what we can, but we need reinforcements, please.",
        "Frank: I'm on my way.",
        "Buzz: Uh, what was that about?",
        "Frank: Nothing, pop. Absolutely nothing.",
        "Buzz: Really? It's Company. Phillip has made his move.",
        "Frank: I'll handle it.",
        "Buzz: Are the bulldozers there?",
        "Frank: I told you I will handle it. Let's go, you guys.",
        "Marina: We'll call you. Okay, Grandpa?",
        "Lillian: I'll be right back. Frank? You okay?",
        "Buzz: I'm just going to say this once, okay? Get me to a phone and get me out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: You want to know what's going on?",
        "Crowd: (Chanting): Save Company! Save Company!",
        "Harley: You want to know what's going on? Phillip Spaulding is out to destroy my family's business. And you know what I say? I say, \"Over my dead body.\"",
        "Bill: Harley. Harley, Harley, Harley. Harley.",
        "Harley: Come on, Mr. Demolition man. Come on. Bring it on.",
        "Bill: Harley, I've worked with these crews before. They're going to mow this place down whether you're here or not.",
        "Harley: They won't. They won't.",
        "Bill: Yes, they will.",
        "Harley: They won't.",
        "Bill: And you will get hurt. Now, come on. Let's go.",
        "Harley: No. I'm staying put, Bill. I'm staying put.",
        "Bill: Harley, if you don't walk out of here, they're going to carry you out of here.",
        "Harley: Oh, really?",
        "Bill: Yes.",
        "Harley: Oh, really?",
        "Bill: That's what's going to happen.",
        "Harley: Look at this. Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Look at this right here. You're going to love this one, Mr. Demolition man. Here we go. I'm moving? I don't think so.",
        "Foreman: What are you doing? What are you doing?",
        "Harley: I told you. If you're destroying this place, you're doing it over my dead body, and I meant it. Look.",
        "Foreman: You look like a reasonable guy, talk to her.",
        "Harley: Yeah, Bill, talk to me. Go ahead. Tell me how I should let Phillip Spaulding destroy everything that my father has built since he came back to Springfield, right? Tell me how I should just lie down and I should give up. Is that what I should do, Bill?",
        "Bill: This woman is my partner, and her fight is my fight!",
        "Harley: Yeah! Thanks, Bill. I owe you. (Laughs)",
        "Foreman: Mr. Spaulding, I'm glad you're here.",
        "Harley: Oh, so you guys know each other?",
        "Foreman: From the last time.",
        "Harley: What last time?",
        "Gus: He had to run some paperwork through me. Okay, look, take off the handcuffs.",
        "Harley: Oh, I get it. Phillip sent you down here to do his dirty work, huh?",
        "Gus: No. You know, I've done everything I can to make sure this never happened.",
        "Harley: Well, it's happening. It's happening right now and we're not going anywhere.",
        "Bill: Come on, David. You don't want to get in the middle of this. This isn't about destroying a building; it's about destroying people's dreams.",
        "Harley: What if it was your family? What if it was your family's business that these rich, greedy pigs were trying to take away? How would you feel?",
        "Foreman: I can't give my guys the okay as long as these two are locked up here, Mr. Spaulding. If anything was to happen, I'd be liable.",
        "Gus: Yeah, I understand that. So why don't you just pack up and get everybody out of here? Go on.",
        "Phillip: You stay put. And you either do what I'm paying you to do or pick up a sign and join them. Either way, this place is coming down.",
        "Harley: You are despicable.",
        "Buzz: Well, Phillip. Here I am. Give me your best shot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ray: Hey, bro.",
        "Tony: Hey.",
        "Ray: We celebrating something?",
        "Tony: Yeah, actually.",
        "Ray: No, no, no. I can't.",
        "Tony: Ray? It's all right. One glass won't kill you.",
        "Ray: Tony, I'm on duty.",
        "Tony: We've got to make a toast.",
        "Ray: What's the occasion?",
        "Tony: Danny's house. It's mine now. To new beginnings.",
        "Ray: Salud. New beginnings, to you, Danny and Michelle.",
        "Tony: Well, me and Michelle, yeah.",
        "Ray: (Chokes)",
        "Tony: But Danny's on his own. You all right? Hm?",
        "Ray: What are you talking about? Danny is the reason you bought the place, to help him get on his feet, so he and Michelle can find their way back together again.",
        "Tony: Did I say that?",
        "Ray: Tony, what's going on?",
        "Tony: Nothing Ray. It's just... I don't know, I'm thinking. You know? Maybe Danny and Michelle will get back together, and maybe they won't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Oh, come on. It's just a scrape. You're tougher than that.",
        "Michelle: As soon as you're finished with that, I'm going to get my stuff together and I'm going to go. If you'll permit it.",
        "Danny: Look, Michelle, about the permit... when I arranged that for you, yeah, at first there was a part of me that wanted to impress you. Can you blame me? But after seeing how important this lighthouse is to you, how much it makes you happy, I want to help you.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, with the little added perk of me feeling beholden to you.",
        "Danny: No, not beholden. I just want you to know that you can count on me. Me. Not Tony.",
        "Michelle: You know Tony has been great to me. And I have to count on him because he's my business partner.",
        "Danny: Michelle, I think it's a little more than that for Tony.",
        "Michelle: Well, maybe. Maybe the fact that he saved my life, maybe that deepens the connection for him. Maybe for me too. But anything else is just in your head, okay? Look, I don't blame you for what happened in the warehouse, so you've got to stop blaming yourself, all right?",
        "Danny: Michelle, I can't stop caring about you. Okay? Just do that.",
        "Michelle: Good. Good. I don't want you to stop caring. I just need you to give me the freedom to make my own mistakes, just like you do. That's fair, isn't it?",
        "Danny: Yeah, that's fair. As long as one of those mistakes isn't Tony.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: All the years I was hiding in Europe, I wasn't just running from the law. I was running from myself. From all the pain I had caused. And I kept seeing the moment that I pulled that trigger play over and over in my mind. I saw your face when you walked into the room, and your face, and Hart's face. And what it had done to you, Daddy, and what it had done to Bill and Mom.",
        "Blake: Notice how she leaves me out?",
        "Dinah: Blake, I promise you, I felt terrible for you, too. I couldn't bear who I had become. I wanted to be someone else. And financially, I needed to survive, so when I had the opportunity to impersonate you, I grabbed it.",
        "Cassie: What opportunity? How?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, let's just say I work for the United States government and I have a proposal for you.",
        "Dinah: What sort of proposal?",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, the normal kind. You see I need a wife.",
        "Dinah: Your husband, the Prince, died. And you came back to Springfield to live again. So the role of Princess was vacant. I figured I knew you well enough to impersonate you, and as long as I kept a low enough profile in Europe, you'd never catch on. But when you... when you were onto me and you figured it out and everything fell apart, I couldn't live with myself. So, it was either kill myself or come clean and try to regain some kind of dignity.",
        "Blake: Why didn't you turn yourself in the second you got into town, Dinah?",
        "Dinah: Blake, I had to go out to the farm to take one last look around before I turned myself in. And when I got there, when I saw the barn, what I saw was horrible. The barn was up in flames and little RJ, he was stranded in the loft. Cassie was pinned beneath a beam. And I said to myself, \"well, here it goes. What do I do? Do I just run and have one more thing to regret? Or do you stay and help, and in some way hope I can make up for all of the sorrow I've caused.\" So I grabbed RJ, ran through the flames and went out to get help for Cassie because I knew I couldn't get her out of there on my own.",
        "Blake: That's some story.",
        "Dinah: Well, it's the truth. And now that I've told everything, I obviously am going to take whatever punishment a judge and jury come out with, but I want to be the only one punished here. I don't want to drag other people through the mud.",
        "Cassie: What other people?",
        "Dinah: We're only human. We have our loyalties. And sometimes a love can be so consuming, so ferocious it makes you do terrible, terrible things. Things that can only hurt the people we love the most.",
        "Cassie: You still love to jerk people around, don't you? What's with that statement you just made?",
        "Dinah: I'm sure you can figure it out.",
        "Cassie: Well, I can't. I have no idea what you're talking about, Dinah.",

        "Blake: Are you telling me that you knew she was in town and you protected her?",
        "Ross: She's my daughter.",
        "Dinah: The whole time, he was urging me to do the right thing, to come clean, and it was because of your faith and your support that I had the strength to do just that.",
        "Blake: We need to talk.",
        "Tammy: You've heard enough.",
        "Jeffrey: Ms. Marler, if you'll come with me, please. That was quite a performance.",

        "Tony: Ray, everybody acts like Michelle and Danny are destined to be together, like it's God's will or something, but have you noticed from day one? Things have been trying to keep them apart, Ray. Haven't you noticed that?",
        "Ray: Okay, so they've had their share of challenges. All right.",
        "Tony: They were forced to be together, Ray. All right? It's not about love with these two. Besides, Michelle has never had the opportunity to see who she really is as a person.",
        "Ray: Oh, and you want to give her that opportunity? Because you want what's best for her?",
        "Tony: I don't know, don't you?",
        "Ray: Don't give me that bull, Tony. You're going after your cousin's wife! You can rationalize it any way you want to, but that's the bottom line. What, did you call me over here to ask for my blessing? Is that it?",
        "Tony: Ray...",

        "Michelle: You couldn't save me from the fire and Tony did, so now in your head, I must want Tony. And then we have this bond together, so it makes it even worse for you.",
        "Danny: Michelle, no. Wrong. The truth is, you do turn to Tony first. You do.",
        "Michelle: Not because I have a thing for him, but because he doesn't have expectations that I can't meet.",
        "Danny: Fine. I get that. I do. But do you have to continue it any further? Do you have to open a club with him?",
        "Michelle: It's because I have to get away from you, because you are driving me crazy. And, you know, and then you go and you get this building permit so I can make light happen, and I think, okay, well maybe we can be close to each other, you know? He understands me. He supports me. And then I find out you actually don't.",
        "Danny: No, I do. I did. Part of me... yes, part of that was to hold on to you but it's not anymore. It's not.",
        "Michelle: So you learned your lesson, then? The harder you hold on to me, the farther I run.",
        "Danny: See? No hands.",
        "Michelle: All right, look. This is going to be good for us, okay? Leaving this house behind with all the memories. We can start from scratch, right? I'm going to actually be able to get to know you. Without all the baggage and without all the history. And I really... I would like it... no, actually, I would love it, if you would get to know me, too.",

        "Buzz: Do it and you're dog meat, Frank. Well, let's see Spaulding Enterprises mow down old Grandpa on his porch after his heart attack. Better yet, let's let the whole town see that.",

        "Coop: Yeah, well, you may have the law on your side, but you know what? We've got the media.",

        "Phillip: Excuse me? If you... if you give these people airtime, you're going to be presenting a very distorted image of this situation.",
        "Harley: No, no, no, no, no. He is the distorted one. He gets some sick pleasure from grinding my family into the ground.",

        "Ray: Hear me out. First you went after his turf. Then you went after his house. What, so now you're going after his wife? Why, Tony? Why? Because he didn't give you your props as you were coming up through the ranks?",
        "Tony: Like you understand, Ray? You are the last person to give advice, you and your vow of celibacy, man. You know, forget it. I shouldn't have... you don't know the first thing about love between a man and a woman. I should...",

        "Michelle: No, you're not. You're not. I will be careful, I promise you. Let's just get our stuff together and we can go.",
        "Danny: Michelle? I just want you to know that if you ever need my help, I'm just a phone call away. And I'm not talking about necessarily coming to the rescue. I mean to, you know, make you a mojito on a sunny afternoon.",
        "Michelle: You know how to make a mojito?",
        "Danny: Well, it's too bad you forgot that. Do I know how to make a mojito? The secret is all in the mint. You've got to have a ton of it and just a splash of club soda. Do I know how to make a mojito? Please.",

        "Dinah: I also saved Cassie and RJ from burning to death. You gave me my freedom once, Jeffrey. You can do it again. I want to start clean and so do you. Whether you like it or not, we need each other. We're a team again.",
        "Jeffrey: No, I don't think so. As a matter of fact, everything I do from now on is going to be for Cassie Winslow. That's right. To make sure that she's protected and safe. You're on your own. Take her to her cell.",
        "Blake: You protected her, Ross. You protected her when you knew you would be putting me, Cassie and God knows who else at risk. How could you do that? How could you do that?",

And if it doesn't, and Michelle now decides that she wants something different for her life and herself now, and I'm that guy, Ray? Hey, maybe I can be the guy who gives her what she needs. There's only one way to find out, am I right?",

        "Blake: She belongs in prison.",
        "Ross: I completely disagree. If anything, she deserves leniency, and this is why I purposely did not defend the Cooper's against the Spaulding's. I needed some political capital. Now I've got it and now I'm going to use it. I am going to petition the governor so that he can pardon Dinah.",
