        "Dinah: Well, did I do something weird in the produce section in a grocery store last night, or was that just a dream.",
        "Harley: There was no produce store. But you did a nice dance for Jeffrey's cronies.",
        "Dinah: Oh, that's right. Yes, I do remember that.",
        "Harley: You're miserable without Mallet.",

        "Mallet: Yeah, yeah, I think that is you. I just thought I would come over and give you a little warning.",
        "Dinah: You didn't come by to give me warning. You came by to give me grief.",
        "Mallet: Why would I give you grief?",
        "Dinah: Because you see me kissing Jeffrey there, and I'm sure you are wondering if I slept with him.",
        "Mallet: I don't care-- did you sleep with him?",
        "Dinah: When?",
        "Mallet: When?",
        "Dinah: I'm specifically asking you when are you asking about, last week, last month, what?",
        "Mallet: Last night.",
        "Dinah: Are you jealous?",
        "Mallet: I'm not jealous. I admitted to you I slept with Harley, so I thought you could admit to me you slept with Jeffrey.",
        "Dinah: No need, because we're not together anymore.",
        "Mallet: Right, we're over. No need. So if you're sleeping with Jeffrey, or if you're sleeping with half the town, it is your business and anybody else who logs on to the \"Springfieldburns.com.\" (Cell phone rings) Hello, Mallet. (Cell phone rings)",
        "Dinah: Dinah.",

        "Dinah: So what I'm trying to say is our wedding reception is scheduled for tonight.",
        "Mallet: Right, but since there won't a wedding, see, that's why we'd like our money back.",
        "Manager: You can't be serious.",
        "Dinah: Hello. Do you we look like a couple? Because we're not a couple. And by the way, he broke up with me.",
        "Mallet: You broke up with me.",
        "Dinah: After he accused me of being an arsonist!",
        "Mallet: You are an arsonist!",
        "Dinah: I am not an arsonist!",
        "Mallet: You tried to start a fire!",
        "Manager: Look! Look! I'm sorry for your troubles, but everything's been arranged. It's too late to cancel.",
        "Dinah: I'm sorry, I must not be making myself clear. I'm not marrying A.C. Mallet whosoever, ever!",
        "Mallet: You have to excuse her. She is a little mentally unstable.",
        "Dinah: Mentally unstable? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Mentally unstable!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: My grandma took my hand and she looked at me and she said baby girl, don't marry A.C. Don't marry him. I'm begging of you, and it's my last wish.\" And she just closed her eyes and said, \"He loved you.\"",
        "Manager: I'm sorry, but I can't refund your money.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: I know it's going to be a dangerous mission, somewhere in the desert. They won't tell me where. All I know is that I leave tomorrow, and I may never come back.",
        "Manager: No refund.",
        "Mallet: Are you sure?",
        "Manager: I'm sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: I can't believe I'm paying for this.",
        "Dinah: You're paying for half.",
        "Mallet: Whatever. Not the point.",
        "Dinah: No, the point is you're just going to whine the whole day about this.",
        "Mallet: I'm whining? I'm whining?",
        "Dinah: Yes, you are, and since I'm paying half, I have plans.",
        "Mallet: You have plans?",
        "Dinah: Mm-hm. I'm going to throw myself a reception. A little celebration of my independence.",
        "Mallet: Goodie. You going to jump out of a cake for a few of Jeffrey's friends?",
        "Dinah: I don't know why you would care since you wouldn't be there to see it.",
        "Mallet: The hell I won't. I paid for half of this. So I'm going to be here. I'm going to stay and I'm going to celebrate.",

        "Mallet: Uh-huh.",
        "Dinah: No, see, not at my party.",
        "Mallet: No, no, my party. It'll be my party. It'll be independence day. It'll be a celebration of the breakup that obviously speared me years of therapy bills.",
        "Dinah: Okay. All right, good. Well you know what, you can have your party and I'll have my party. Your guests can be on that side of the room, and my guests can be on this side of the room, okay? And this aisle here, this will act as the divider. Okay?",
        "Mallet: Okay.",
        "Dinah: And one other thing...",
        "Mallet: Uh-huh. Oh, no, let me guess. Let me guess. No crossing over the line?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Dinah: Mom, freeze. Matt, down here, please. Thank you.",
        "Vanessa: What is going on? We got your message.",
        "Matt: What exactly is an anti-wedding party?",
        "Dinah: Mallet and I have broken up, so therefore, we got stuck with the bill, so eat up. That way we can get our money's worth.",
        "Matt: Okay.",
        "Vanessa: Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.",
        "Dinah: Mom, I have your support, right? Your full support tonight.",
        "Vanessa: Of course you do. Always.",
        "Dinah: Okay.",

        "Dinah: Matt, if you tell me I told you so, I'm going to make you wear the wedding cake, okay.",
        "Matt: I wasn't going to say that.",
        "Dinah: Good.",
        "Harley: Hi, Matt. Hi, Vanessa. How are you guys? Can I just borrow the anti- bride for just a second.",
        "Matt: Sure.",
        "Harley: Get over here. Down here. Down here. You're being a child. What is this? What are you doing? Why don't you tell him how you feel?",
        "Dinah: He accused me of practically being a slut, of sleeping with Jeffrey O'Neill.",
        "Harley: Did you?",
        "Dinah: Not recently, no.",
        "Harley: Well, that's good. Then it is just a misunderstanding. Go tell him. Come on, go.",
        "Dinah: I don't think I can marry a man I can't trust.",
        "Harley: You're running. Do you see that you're running?",
        "Dinah: Look at the way he chews. Do you think I can live with that for 50 years.",
        "Harley: That's not the question. The question is, could you live without him for 50 years.",
        "Dinah: You know he snores? He scratches when he doesn't think I'm looking.",
        "Harley: I don't want to hear about where he scratches.",
        "Marina: Hey, guys. Police business. Catch you later. Hey, boss.",
        "Mallet: Wow, hot. Very hot. What's in the envelope?",
        "Marina: Thanks. I printed those pictures of Springfieldburns.com. It turns out they're legit.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I know. I already know that.",
        "Marina: I figured if we studied the camera angels, maybe question some people, we can get a lead on this blogger.",
        "Mallet: You know what, do me a favor, just throw those pictures down the elevator shaft. Ow, what the...",
        "Dinah: Yeah, you are on that side, on Mallet's side.",
        "Buzz: Can we fill up plates, first?",
        "Dinah: That depends, are you hers or are you his?",
        "Buzz: My kid wants a pig in a blanket.",
        "Dinah: Harley, should I call security--",
        "Harley: I'll take care of it. Dad, Dinah and Mallet are having separate parties. You have to choose which side you're on, his or hers?",
        "Buzz: I left my hat in the car.",
        "Harley: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: You're making the biggest mistake of your life.",
        "Dinah: Hi, Blake, I'm glad you could join us.",
        "Blake: Okay, get over there. You beg his forgiveness. Forget your pride. True love comes around once in a lifetime. He's it. He's it for you.",
        "Dinah: And I guess if Mallet is it for me, then Jeffrey can be it for you. Is that the agenda?",
        "Blake: You're happy with Mallet. What's the alternative, something meaningless and empty with Jeffrey?",
        "Dinah: Well, I've done meaningless and empty for most of my life. I'm pretty good at it. Works for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: We meet again. Where's Ava?",
        "Coop: She couldn't be here.",
        "Alan-Michael: She show you her new wardrobe?",
        "Coop: Even better, actually. Got a chance to try it on. Let me tell you, it makes a huge difference.",
        "Dinah: Okay, none of that love talk. Nothing like that. No romantic talk or anything about marriage. Not that kind of party, boys. Sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Yeah, so I think the thing is to keep the mini quiches coming and you don't have to worry about that side of the room because they're all on diets over there.",
        "Waitress: Really?",
        "Mallet: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: You know you can keep those drinks flowing, okay, but just not on that side because that side is full of drunks and they're not even funny, so... you know do you want to dance?",
        "Waiter: Ah, sure, but, um...",
        "Dinah: Okay, good. Charlie, could you turn up the music please? We need to get this party started. Okay. Can you hold that? Yeah, okay. How old are you?",
        "Waiter: 22.",
        "Dinah: Really? Perfect, perfect. Good, good. That's right, okay. This way. Okay. Loosen up.",
        "Waiter: Yeah. Whoa.",
        "Mallet: Stand down, junior.",
        "Dinah: (Laughs) So, what are you going to do? No, Mallet-- no-- no, don't you cross me over that line.",
        "Mallet: As far as I'm concerned, you've already crossed over the line.",
        "Dinah: It is my party, and I'll dance with whoever I want to dance with.",
        "Mallet: You're making a spectacle of yourself.",
        "Dinah: Raymond is not one of the waiters. He is my date.",
        "Waiter: Actually, my name is... never mind.",
        "Dinah: Ladies and gentlemen, this man does not have a pass to tell me what to do because he was engaged to me. The reason why I didn't invite him to my party is because he's too damn stubborn. Move.",
        "Mallet: I'm not moving. You're going to hurt herself, and I'm not going to let you do it.",
        "Vanessa: I think it is time.",
        "Matt: I think you're right.",
        "Mallet: These are my guests--",
        "Dinah: My guests like me better. Harley is on my side, and Marina's here--",
        "Mallet: Marina is on my side because she works for me.",
        "Dinah: Oh, yeah, she hates you because she told me.",
        "Harley: Okay, I can't watch this. Hoping I would find you along a broken road I got lost a time or two I couldn't see down every sign pointing straight to you because every long-lost dream led me to where you are others who broke my heart they were like northern stars pointing me on my way into your loving arms this much I know is true that God bless the broken roads that led me to you.",
        "(Applause)",
        "Mallet: We had some good times, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: We had some good times.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, we had some great times.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, and you even got on your knees to ask me to marry you. That is something that girls dream about it, believe it or not, as kooky as it is.",
        "Mallet: It was kind of kooky, wasn't it?",
        "Dinah: I liked it. Most women can go a lifetime without a moment like that. I don't know, I don't think they expect a man to rush into a burning building to save their lives, and you did. All in all, it has not been bad.",
        "Mallet: Not at all bad.",
        "Dinah: So where were?",
        "Mallet: You were about to call the cops on me.",
        "Dinah: Right.",
        "Mallet: And I reminded you they were all my friends.",
        "Dinah: Yeah. You know, I don't really feel like arguing anymore.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, me neither. This is something.",
        "Dinah: It could have been one of those days. The canap\u00e9s tasted kind of freaky going down.",
        "Mallet: You know what is also freaky, an urge I'm having.",
        "Dinah: And urge, you're not felling well?",
        "Mallet: And urge to cut a wedding cake. You know what is really freaky? I really want to hear you say, \"I do.\" Dinah?",
        "Dinah: Don't look at me, I'm thinking.",
        "Mallet: What are you thinking about?",
        "Dinah: I'm thinking about what you just said. Was it what you just said or am I screwing it up in my head. I don't want to seem like an idiot.",
        "Mallet: What do you think you heard?",
        "Dinah: That maybe you would want to still marry somebody?",
        "Mallet: (Laughs) I don't want to marry someone. I want to marry you.",
        "Dinah: Let me get this right: You want to marry me right here and right now, with all these people and me being the bride and you the groom?",
        "Mallet: Yeah. Let's do it like we originally planned. We'll take up that dividing line, we have to take that up, and all these people-- they can be our guests.",
        "Dinah: But then in the morning, I'm going to wake up, and you're going to wake up, and I'm going to be--",
        "Mallet: You'd be my wife.",
        "Dinah: Are you ready for that?",
        "Mallet: Are you?",
        "Dinah: I asked you first?",
        "Mallet: Of course I am ready. I've been going crazy without you these past few weeks. Babe, I know we have some problems, but how are we going to solve them without solving them together. Besides, I can't wait on the sidelines while you dance with every waiter. I wanted to deck him--",
        "Dinah: I was just using him. It was for you-- the dance was completely for you.",
        "Mallet: No kidding.",
        "Dinah: You know, the truth is, I've missed you, too.",
        "Mallet: Oh, I've missed you.",
        "Dinah: I missed you.",
        "Mallet: Not more than I missed you. I miss the way you take up all of the space in the closet, and the way you feel in bed, and the cold feet, and the terrible racket you make in the shower when you cut your legs--",
        "Dinah: I miss the way you play with the service revolver before you go to bed, and the sticky stuff you put in your hair and the snoring noises. I miss it.",
        "Mallet: And I miss you nagging me to get my badge off the toilet before it falls in the toilet.",
        "Dinah: And I miss getting it out of the toilet.",
        "Mallet: Really?",
        "Dinah: Well, no, not really. But I miss these, and I miss these around me, and these loving me every day no matter what I do, even if I don't deserve it.",
        "Mallet: You deserve it. You deserve it. I love you. And I never stopped loving you.",
        "Dinah: I love you, too. Yes!",
        "Mallet: What?",
        "Dinah: Yes, yes, I will marry you. (Giggling)",
        "Mallet: Ah, hi. Everybody, we're getting married. (Applause and cheers)",
        "Dinah: Okay, everybody, wait, wait.",
        "Vanessa: I did not come empty handed to this party. I brought my husband who brought this. (Applause and cheers)",
        "Dinah: Why did you do that?",
        "Vanessa: Because I know you, and I know you love him and he loves you. Would you like to try this pretty thing on?",
        "Dinah: Yes, yes. Oh, my gosh. Is this too crazy.",
        "Audience: No!",
        "Vanessa: Come on.",
        "Harley: Come on, get dressed. I'll even been your bridesmaid if you'll have me?",
        "Dinah: Did you cross the line?",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Dinah: Okay. And for you, mystery--",
        "Frank: I've got my gun, so he is not going anywhere. I'll make sure he doesn't back out.",
        "Mallet: Not a chance, Frank.",
        "Vanessa: No, no. Save that for the ceremony. Just let her go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Wait, wait, wait, ouch, ouch. There, there, perfect.",
        "Vanessa: Turn around, wait a minute. Let me look at you.",
        "Dinah: You're my best friend, you know, that, Mom?",
        "Vanessa: I know it. I wish Ross were here. He would be so proud of you.",
        "Dinah: I know. I know. I know, I miss him, too. I can't believe he is not going to be walking me down the aisle.",
        "Vanessa: Oh, he is. He is here. Aren't you, Ross. Don't answer.",
        "Dinah: So, tell me, the video, who did that, you or Matt?",
        "Vanessa: Oh, no, no, no, it was Harley or Blake or...",
        "Dinah: Mom!",
        "Vanessa: Of course it was me.",
        "Dinah: You love him, don't you?",
        "Vanessa: Yes, I do. He is the right man for you.",
        "Dinah: You know something, I'm not much of a blushing bride, personally I think a white wedding dress is kind of silly. But that is it, this is me and Mallet.",
        "Vanessa: Yes, this is you and Mallet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matt: Thanks for coming on such short notice.",
        "Buzz: I'm catering a Bible study group for the next couple of weeks.",
        "Coop: You are?",
        "Buzz: We are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vanessa: All right, everybody, we're ready. Take your places. Frank, do you have the rings?",
        "Frank: Rings, I don't have any rings.",
        "Mallet: We don't have any rings.",
        "Harley: Oh, dear. You can use mine. That is a loaner.",
        "Frank: We have rings.",
        "Mallet: Thank you, Harley. Thank you, Matt.",
        "Vanessa: Now we're ready, right?",
        "Audience: Right!",

        "Jeffrey: Hi. I'm sorry to interrupt, but we need to talk.",
        "Dinah: Okay, Jeffrey, later.",
        "Jeffrey: Now.",
        "Dinah: Later, or I'm going to be late.",
        "Jeffrey: Then you're going to be late.",
        "Dinah: In case you haven't noticed, I'm wearing a really long, lacey white gown, it is a wedding gown.",
        "Jeffrey: It looks nice, but I have to question the color white.",
        "Dinah: What the hell do you want?",
        "Jeffrey: We have trouble.",
        "Dinah: No, see, you have trouble. You hear that music, that is for me to walk down the aisle and I have friends and family waiting for me. Or don't you get it?",
        "Jeffrey: No, I get it all. But there is something you need to do for me.",
        "Dinah: Are you kidding? Are you asking me to run out of my own wedding to run a freakin' errand for you.",
        "Jeffrey: I don't want to ruin this, but I have no choice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: I think something is wrong.",
        "Frank: Do you think she is on a bus to Texas?",
        "Mallet: It never crossed my mind, until now. Everybody sit tight. The bride will be here in a minute-- I hope.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Just take it easy, take it easy.",
        "Dinah: Will you let me go.",
        "Jeffrey: Shut up and listen to me for a minute. You need to hear this. Someone from the agency showed up and he warned me to back out of the mayors' race or he was going to send everything-- everything-- Dinah, that the agency has on me to Spaulding.",
        "Dinah: I don't care. I want to go.",
        "Jeffrey: They'll own me. The agency owned me once before, and I swore that would never happen again. Everything I worked for will be ripped apart.",
        "Dinah: You are ripping my life apart right now. I have a wedding to go...",
        "Jeffrey: You can go back as soon as you get me that file. It is in the Spaulding house waiting for Alan-Michael. It arrived about an hour ago.",
        "Dinah: I will do it after my ceremony?",
        "Jeffrey: That's the point, Alan-Michael is here.",
        "Dinah: Then you go.",
        "Jeffrey: I can't go. Someone will be waiting for me. You, on the other hand, are Alan-Michael's right-hand man. You zip in and zip out, and that way I don't have to go to the D.A. and present him with everything I know about the fire and present him with enough evidence to put you away for years.",
        "Dinah: Don't you threat then me. I am not going back to jail!",
        "Jeffrey: Then you do as I ask. I will win this election and everything will be okay. I will win this election at all costs.",
        "Dinah: At my cost? I don't think so, that isn't the way it is going to happen. Okay? No.",
        "Jeffrey: Just get the file. You're guests will wait.",
        "Dinah: No, they won't. Because I'm going to tell you something. I'm telling Mallet, I'm telling Mallet everything, and you're not going to make me do this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Did you find Dinah?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: I'm going to go out there and I will tell Mallet you have been blackmailing me and you intend to send me to jail because I had an accident. I did not intend to start that fire at the Beacon, and you know that. And he loves me, and I'm going to marry him and he is going to stand by me like husbands do.",
        "Jeffrey: Mallet, uh-huh, is going to stand by you. Is this the same Mallet that had you investigated, and the same Mallet that had you arrested for that very same fire?",
        "Dinah: He loves me.",
        "Jeffrey: The guy is a cop. He has to report everything he knows to his superiors, and the real questions are going to start. And what are you going to say? You going to say it was an accident. And they're going to say Ms. Marler, if it was an accident, why didn't you come forward.",
        "Dinah: I didn't come forward because I was afraid.",
        "Jeffrey: What were you afraid of?",
        "Dinah: Of going to prison.",
        "Jeffrey: Why would you be afraid if you were innocent?",
        "Dinah: Stop it.",
        "Jeffrey: It will be a lot harder when the real in interrogation starts? If you weren't guilty, why would you be afraid of going to prison?",
        "Dinah: Because...",
        "Jeffrey: Why Dinah? Why? Even the truth can't set you free. Only I can do that. Just like you're the only one who can help me right now.",
        "Dinah: Mallet, honey, I have to talk to you.",
        "Mallet: I'm not sure that I want to hear anything about this.",
        "Dinah: I know that the music is going on right now, and I know I'm late, but I need to take care of something.",
        "Mallet: What?",
        "Dinah: Look, all I need you to do is take care of the guests. I will not be long, okay?",
        "Mallet: You want me to stop the wedding now? Why? What is it that you need to do?",
        "Dinah: I can't tell you, but you need to trust me. I know you told me we're going to get through anything together, that we love each other, and I know this is the most important day of our lives, but I need you to trust me, and I need you to know that I am doing this for us, okay, Mallet.",
        "Mallet: Do you trust me? Do you trust me loving you. Not somebody who holds things over your head for any twisted reason. Can you trust me. Can you talk to me? Tell me what is going on here so I can help you. Trust me, because if you don't believe in me, what do we have?",
        "Dinah: I can't do it again.",
        "Mallet: What?",
        "Dinah: I can't go back.",
        "Mallet: What are you afraid of? Just tell me. Can you just tell me? I swear, if you walk out that door, it's over. It's over between us, honey.",
        "Dinah: I'm sorry.",
        "Frank: Mallet.",
        "Harley: Where is Dinah?",
        "Mallet: She's gone.",
        "Harley: Gone?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, she's gone for good. You can send the minister home. I think the wedding is over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Oh, baby, what have I done? What have I done?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: Hey runaway bride, what are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Hey, come on. I know just what you need.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: What are you doing here?",
        "Alan-Michael: Well, the wedding I was supposed to be at got canceled. Mind telling me what the bride is doing here?",
        "Dinah: I had nowhere else to go.",
        "Alan-Michael: Like last time, your first date with Mallet, I got the leftovers, remember?",
        "Dinah: I'm not here for that...",
        "Alan-Michael: Then why are you here?",
        "Dinah: I don't know, Alan-Michael. Maybe you just caught me. Maybe you figured out I'm a workaholic bride. I'd rather cuddle up to the computer than be a slave wife to my man. I think I could cuddle up to a Spaulding report easier.",
        "Alan-Michael: Nice, but I'm not buying it.",
        "Dinah: What do you want from me?",
        "Alan-Michael: Since hooking up is out, why don't you tell me the reason you ran out on Mallet, the real reason.",
        "Dinah: Popcorn.",
        "Alan-Michael: Popcorn.",
        "Dinah: He hates it when I get the kernels stuck in my teeth. It drives him nuts. I can't go through that. I couldn't possibly marry a man like that.",
        "Alan-Michael: Now that I can understand. Go home. Get some sleep.",
        "Dinah: Good idea.",
        "Alan-Michael: Dinah, I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Come on. This isn't some stupid, sappy idea of driving me around in your car and listen to sad songs so I can cry over losing Dinah, because you can forget it.",
        "Marina: Do I look stupid to you? Come on, you know me better than that. Come on, sit.",
        "Mallet: How much punch did you have at that almost wedding.",
        "Marina: Come on, it's the White Sox.",
        "Mallet: That's right, they're on tonight. I guess I could watch a couple of innings. He is back from injury, isn't he?",
        "Marina: You want to place any bets?",
        "Mallet: Hell no, I already lost one hand today. That's enough for me. You know, it wasn't supposed to happen like this.",
        "Marina: Game, Mallet. Just shut up and watch the game.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Take it. Take it. Damn it, damn it, damn it.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm sorry. You know I didn't have any choice.",
        "Dinah: You're not sorry. You're not sorry for one minute of anything you've done.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you can believe it or not, but I am sorry. And not just about tonight and what happened. I'm sorry about our past. I'm sorry about our lives and the way they are. I'm sorry that our lives are intertwined forever until we die, Dinah. I wish you could have the life that you always wanted. But now I'm beginning to wonder if that is possible for either of us.",
        "Dinah: Because you know that it's not. You know that it's not because deep down you know inside you believe that you don't deserve it, either.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, you're probably right.",
        "Dinah: Jeffrey, please just be with me tonight. Please be with me. Just you and me, okay? We're both just too messed up to be with anybody else.",
        "Jeffrey: Dinah.",
        "Dinah: No. You got what you wanted. You got what you wanted, okay, you got your file. But I don't have what I want, and I can't be alone tonight. I need you to be with me. Just this once. Just this once, please, just be with me, just this once.",
