        "Harley: Boy Daddy, you will do anything to get attention, huh?",
        "Buzz: Did it work?",
        "Harley: Well, it depends on what it is you wanted. If you're enjoying your stay here in the hospital, it worked. Because Rick says with this infection, you'll be here for at least a few more days.",
        "Bill: Yeah, and you're a real folk hero in this town, fighting off the corporate giant, stopping those bulldozers with your bare hands, breaking shovels over your kneecaps. It's unbelievable. You're all over the papers.",
        "Harley: Yeah. Score one for the Cooper's. We won the battle, and we'll win the war.",
        "Buzz: No. No war. Gus. Gus. You two be happy together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Attorney: So I had Marge reorder the McMillan briefs, if... oh, but article 137 still needs a caveat, if you could take a look at that.",
        "Gus: Just kill me right now. Uh, article 130...",
        "Attorney: Yeah, 137.",
        "Gus: Seven. Needs a caveat? Yeah. I'll work on that.",
        "Attorney: Yeah, and I needed a decision on this yesterday.",
        "Gus: Yeah? Well, I'll, you know, work through it, and I'll get on that right away.",
        "Beth: Gus.",
        "Gus: Yeah?",
        "Beth: Alan needs to see you. He says that it's urgent.",
        "Gus: Really? Okay, then. What we'll do... you know, I will work... work through this, Greg.",
        "Attorney: Randall.",
        "Gus: Randall. And I will get back to you as soon as I can, okay?",
        "Attorney: Phillip is not going to be happy about this.",
        "Gus: Well, you know, Phillip's miserable about everything, isn't he?",
        "Beth: Starting with that showdown at Company last night?",
        "Gus: Well, he doesn't like to lose.",
        "Beth: In Phillip's defense, I don't think many people like to lose.",
        "Gus: Yeah, but he could be a lot more graceful about it, you know? Speaking of graceful, you should have seen your mother. Lillian was amazing. She showed up, she kind of sided with the Cooper's, and she told Phillip how she felt.",
        "Beth: It's good to stand up for what you believe in. You ought to try it sometime.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: It is impossible to get good help these days. You don't have any desire to apply for the job of my assistant, do you?",
        "Alan: I'm not sure I would qualify. You've set that bar pretty high, you know. By the way, have you read this morning's paper?",
        "Phillip: No not yet, why?",
        "Alan: Well, the public's not too pleased with your plans for Company. They consider it a Springfield institution, you know.",
        "Phillip: You know what? Don't talk to me about institutions. I just got out of one. And I'm not thrilled with what happened with this Company or this family while I was gone. Somebody has got to get us back on track, and apparently the task has fallen to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: My Mom and RJ could have died in that fire.",
        "Joey: Tammy, they're safe now, okay? That's all that matters.",
        "Tammy: No one in my family is safe, not now that Dinah is back in town.",
        "Joey: Tammy, I am not going to let anything happen to you.",
        "Tammy: I do feel better--safer--having you here with me. You know, I really thought for a while that we were finished, Joey. Lizzie had me convinced that she was going to win you for good by sleeping with you. (Laughs) how paranoid am I?",
        "Lizzie: Hey there, sleepyhead. Joey, you were amazing last night.",
        "Tammy: I don't know what I would have done if that had been true.",
        "Joey: Tammy, you are the only one I care about. Just forget Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Did somebody say my name?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: No, I'm glad you're okay. Did Edmund tell you I stopped by the farm? He said you were still sleeping. Thank God, you know, that this thing is finally over and Dinah is behind bars. I'm at the Beacon. Sandy wanted me to meet him here. He wanted to talk about something. You know, I think something's bothering him. I don't know. That's what I'm here to find out.",
        "Sandy: \"I'm so scared! It's so far down!\" You know, I'm sick of this. And I try. I have tried so hard with you, but...",
        "Jonathan: Whoa. Sandy. Sandy. Help.",
        "Sandy: Hi, this is Sandy Foster. I'm calling about a reservation I have for the noon flight to Switzerland. Yeah, yeah, I made it online. Okay, thanks. Bye.",
        "Reva: Hey.",
        "Sandy: Hey.",
        "Reva: There you are.",
        "Sandy: Sorry I'm late.",
        "Reva: What's all this? What, are you running away from home?",
        "Sandy: Running? Uh, no, nothing that dramatic.",
        "Reva: I pushed you too hard, didn't I, the other night? Asking you all those questions about your past, suggesting that we take a trip down to San Cristobal and visit your adoptive mother?",
        "Sandy: Reva, it's not a big deal.",
        "Reva: Well, you've been avoiding me ever since.",
        "Sandy: Believe me, it's not a big deal. I have things I want to take care of, that's all.",
        "Reva: Well, it must be important enough that if you went home, you packed, and you're leaving town without letting anyone know. That affects all of us. Just tell me where you're going.",
        "Sandy: I'll call you when I get there.",
        "Reva: Okay. Obviously it's an important trip for you.",
        "Sandy: Yeah. And I have to go.",
        "Reva: Okay, just not until you tell me where and why, because I'm not letting you walk out on me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: So what's up? You guys don't look too happy.",
        "Joey: We were just talking about the fire out at the farm.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, right. Yeah, I read about that. That's got to be the most unlucky place. I think it's cursed or something.",
        "Joey: You're not helping, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Sorry. Well, at least you have Joey to stand by you through all this. He's such a great guy. I mean, at least you know no matter what he's done or where he's been, he's never stopped caring about you. And I know that for a fact.",
        "Joey: Lizzie? Can you give us some time alone here, please?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. Sure. You two take care, and I'll see you tomorrow at the job.",
        "Joey: The job?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, did I forget to tell you? Grandpa gave me a job at Spaulding, too. He said it would be a good character-builder for me to work while I'm at college. So we can stay together, as friends. I want us all to be friends again. Okay, see you guys later.",
        "Joey: Sorry. She just has a way of popping up.",
        "Tammy: It's okay. I'm not going to let Lizzie get to me, not anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: What are you doing here? Can't you just pretend I don't even exist?",
        "JB: You're way too hot to forget.",
        "Lizzie: What are you doing?",
        "JB: Isn't that the guy you bought the goods for?",
        "Lizzie: That's none of your business.",
        "JB: I'm doing a customer survey. Did you have a good time?",
        "Lizzie: Get lost.",
        "JB: I guess I'll ask him.",
        "Lizzie: No. You can't do that.",
        "JB: Well, I get the feeling you didn't tell him his happy feeling came from a bottle purchased with your hard-earned money. Now, how bad is that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: You must have me confused with somebody else, blondie. I am famous for sticking up for my beliefs.",
        "Beth: Okay, whatever you say. You just seem a little wobbly lately, and, you know, if you want to make it in this family, you have to step up; you have to make a stand. Croissant?",
        "Gus: Croissant? Croissant and criticism? Is that my breakfast this morning, breakfast of champions?",
        "Beth: The truth is I was hoping to have breakfast with Phillip.",
        "Gus: Yeah, well, you're going to have to settle on me.",
        "Beth: I was hoping that I could sit down with him calmly and get him to see what he is doing to this family. But, unfortunately, he's too busy firing office staff. He's out of control, Gus, and we have to stop him.",
        "Gus: Hm? You, me and what army? (Laughs)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Don't misunderstand me, Phillip. I think you know how proud I am of you, your vision for this city. I'm happy to see you back, filled with energy and new ideas for the Company and for the family. You have become the man that I have always wanted you to be. But never forget one thing: I am head of this family.",
        "Phillip: Everything that I'm doing is for my children's future and I'm not going to see that jeopardized because you have suddenly decided, for some bizarre reason, that you need to join the vigil at Buzz Cooper's bedside.",
        "Alan: Buzz has just had a heart attack, Phillip. I know what he's going through. I had one myself. His family is going through some very tough times.",
        "Phillip: Where is this coming from? Frank Cooper stuck a gun in your face a few weeks ago. Now you want to join hands with these people and sing \"Kumbaya\"?",
        "Alan: Buzz and I have always had our differences, but we've been through a lot the past year. And don't forget one thing: Our families are connected for life.",
        "Phillip: I don't understand you. You know, there was a time where you would have wanted to see justice done for our family just as much as I do.",
        "Alan: And I do right now, and I will stand beside you to ensure that you see all of your dreams. And I think you know that I will cut down any enemy that gets in our way.",
        "Phillip: All right. Then what's the problem?",
        "Alan: I want you to consider before you forge ahead with this, the path that you are going down and the consequences that come with it. Because once you go down that path, Phillip, there's no turning back. I know from experience.",
        "Phillip: Well, I have no intention of turning back, or of changing my path. And I will run over anything that gets in my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Gus. Harley. You two belong together. You always have.",
        "Harley: Yes. Yes. Okay, Daddy. You know what? We are together here, just like we promised. But why don't you rest? Okay? Let us take care of everything else. All right?",
        "Buzz: Love you.",
        "Harley: I love you, too. Sorry.",
        "Bill: He thought I was Gus?",
        "Harley: He thought you were Gus.",
        "Bill: He knows that you two split up, though, right?",
        "Harley: Oh, of course he does. It's just that ever since he had this heart attack, he's been pushing for us to get back together, and, you know, we've been kind of, you know, playing along, just to keep him calm.",
        "Bill: Well, you know, you pretend long enough, it really may happen.",
        "Harley: That ship has sailed.",
        "Bill: If you say so.",
        "Harley: That ship has sailed.",
        "Bill: Okay.",
        "Harley: Okay? It is the Cooper's against the Spaulding's. Gus made his choice. He is collaborating with the enemy.",
        "Bill: Yeah, but Harley, they're his family.",
        "Harley: Why are you defending him all of a sudden?",
        "Bill: No, listen to me. I'm not defending him. It's just... I don't know Gus and I are dealing with the same kind of conflict when it comes to family. That's all. And it's a tough one.",
        "Harley: I don't see that. I don't understand.",
        "Bill: All right, well, I knew and I know I probably should have gone to the authorities and reported her, but I couldn't do that. I mean I know she killed someone. It's not that I condone it. But, I mean, she's my sister.",
        "Harley: I can understand that.",
        "Bill: I think Gus and I are in the same boat, you know? He probably hates what the Spaulding's are doing. I'm sure he does. But he can't turn his back on them.",
        "Harley: Fine. But there's still a big difference, okay? I can understand that when Dinah shot Hart, she was out of her mind.",
        "Bill: Right.",
        "Harley: You know? If there was a crime of passion, that was it. But what Phillip is doing, what the Spaulding's are doing, that is cold and calculated. They're going after my family, over and over and over again.",
        "Bill: Yeah, come on, but Gus? Gus isn't on the attack. He was on our side to get Phillip to get the demolition crew out of there.",
        "Harley: Yeah, but only after the TV crew showed up, because he didn't want the Spaulding's on camera looking like the bottom feeders that they are. I'm sorry. He made his choice, you know? He is siding with the Spaulding's. So you know what I say? He can go down with the rest of them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Not that it's any of your business, but I didn't even use the drug.",
        "JB: Bad move. Looks like Romeo has already hooked up with someone else.",
        "Lizzie: Please. She doesn't mean anything to him.",
        "JB: She's got a lot going for her.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, yeah. Sure, if you like the wholesome, boring type.",
        "JB: I like. I bet nobody ever accused Lizzie Spaulding of being wholesome or boring.",
        "Lizzie: How do you know my name?",
        "JB: Well, everyone knows the Spaulding's, right? Here comes lover boy.",
        "Lizzie: Hurry up. He can't see you. Hi.",
        "Joey: What's going on, Lizzie? You okay?",
        "Lizzie: Where's Tammy at?",
        "Joey: She's inside, calling her Mom. What's wrong?",
        "Lizzie: You know, I never thought this would be so hard. You know, when I saw you guys together, I thought it was going to be easy, but it wasn't.",
        "Joey: Lizzie, I'm sorry you're upset, okay? I never lied to you, though.",
        "Lizzie: No, I know you didn't. Tammy's the one. I know that. But I just thought that once we'd made love...",
        "Joey: Stop saying that, Lizzie. Okay? We didn't make love. I don't remember what happened, but whatever it was, it was nothing, okay? It meant nothing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Hey, Buzz. It's me, Bill.",
        "Harley: It's Bill, Daddy.",
        "Buzz: I know who you are.",
        "Bill: I got some of the paper here for you, sports. I can tell you what's on TV today, and for you, take a look over here. Spaulding Enterprises is hiring people for Phillip's new development project.",
        "Harley: Can we get through a day without the \"s\" word or the \"p\" word, please?",
        "Bill: Okay, this ad here?",
        "Harley: Mm-hmm.",
        "Bill: This ad could provide us with a very interesting opportunity.",
        "Harley: Really? I'm listening.",
        "Bill: Okay, what if we were able to plant someone inside Spaulding?",
        "Harley: A mole.",
        "Bill: A mole, exactly. It says right here, \"opening for personal assistant to CEO.\" Who is that? That's Phillip.",
        "Harley: Yeah, not a lot of job security there, though, because Phillip fires people as soon as they walk in the door.",
        "Bill: All right. Well, why is that? What's he looking for?",
        "Harley: He's looking for the impossible. He's looking for somebody who's part computer, part pit bull, and somebody who is completely loyal to the Spaulding family.",
        "Bill: Loyal. Sounds like a blast.",
        "Harley: No, you're right. We do need to get somebody in there. And I know just the person for the job.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: It's not like I'm just going after the Cooper's. I'm seizing Lewis property, as well. There's no need for anyone in this town to feel persecuted.",
        "Alan: Well, at the moment, the only one being persecuted is you--in the press.",
        "Phillip: Yes. Well, I've been thinking it may be time to buy the \"Journal.\"",
        "Alan: You're spreading yourself a little thin, aren't you?",
        "Phillip: I'm just protecting my interests, the way you taught me to. You're right. I have become the man you always wanted me to be. Congratulations. I have a meeting.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: You've been talking to Alex.",
        "Beth: Yeah. My mother and I alternate days. Why?",
        "Gus: Because she said something very similar. She said, you know, \"be a good little Spaulding. I want you to try to help save the family from itself.\"",
        "Beth: Start with Phillip, and I would be happy. Hey, until recently, I would have waited for him to snap out of it, for him to see the light. But when I look into his eyes, that sensitive part of him that cares about other people, I'm not seeing it anymore.",
        "Gus: Well, it's hard to lose touch with someone you love, you know?",
        "Beth: You're thinking of Harley. Well, you know, she's got to be touched by all the things you're doing to help save her Dad's business.",
        "Gus: She doesn't know what I'm doing on the inside, and I don't really think she needs to, either.",
        "Beth: Are you crazy? Why aren't you letting Harley know all the things you're doing for her?",
        "Gus: Because I don't want her to feel like she owes me anything. And I'm not really doing it for her, anyway. I'm doing it for Buzz. I really do think he's a great guy. Where else can you go in this town and get a free cup of coffee, you know? Plus, this is no way to solve a relationship. Maybe you and Alex have a point. Maybe I can do something to save this family, make a little bit of a difference.",
        "Alan: You already have. I like what you're saying, Gus. And I want you to know that I will support you every step of the way.",
        "Gus: Well, what if I have to take a stand against Phillip on this issue? How are you going to handle that one, pop?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Reva...",
        "Reva: No. You'll get it back after we talk. Now: Where and why?",
        "Sandy: (Sighs) I need some space. That's it. There you go.",
        "Reva: No. I mean, after all the time you spent trying to find me and then reconnecting with me, you're just going to pack up and leave. I don't buy it.",
        "Sandy: Well, I can't cut it anymore. I can hardly get my own act together, and you want me to be a stand-in for Josh and Marah and Shayne, and follow in your footsteps at the TV station. I can't cut it anymore. I can't handle it. It's not that I'm not grateful, because I am. It's just that this family thing, I can't... it's too much.",
        "Reva: Well, I'm sorry to hear that.",
        "Sandy: Look, it's no big deal, Reva. Let it go. And let me go.",
        "Reva: You're not running away from family. You're in some kind of trouble, aren't you? That's it, isn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Hey.",
        "Bill: Okay. What is the name of this secret weapon of yours?",
        "Harley: Ruth.",
        "Bill: Ruth who?",
        "Harley: Karloff.",
        "Bill: As in Boris.",
        "Harley: No relation. But I know how she operates. I'm telling you, she's going to go in there, she's going to turn Phillip's life into a living horror show. She's going to get us the information that we need, and she'll be out of there before Phillip knows what hit him.",
        "Bill: Well, let me tell you, if she can do all that, I'd consider marrying her.",
        "Harley: No, Ruth's not the marrying type. She's definitely into her work. That's it. What I need from you--the only thing I need from you--is an interview with Phillip.",
        "Bill: Of course. I'll just use my good looks and charm.",
        "Harley: I guess we'll have to rely on plan \"B.\" (Laughs)",
        "Bill: Oh, thanks.",
        "Harley: No, no, no. I think we should make him feel like he is stealing a very valuable employee right out from under you.",
        "Bill: Hm, might work, maybe.",
        "Harley: No, it will definitely work. No, because listen: \"A,\" Phillip just loves to screw you over; and \"B,\" he's all about acquiring what other people already have. It's a no-brainer.",
        "Bill: Well, it's worth a shot. Where do we find this Ruth?",
        "Harley: You just leave Ruth to me, okay? I'm telling you, Phillip is not going to know what hit him. Don't worry, Pop. When you get out of this bed, you will definitely have something to come home to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Look, when it comes to this issue, I need to know whose side you're going to pick, mine or Phillip's.",
        "Alan: I never choose sides in family issues. Beth, I saw that look.",
        "Gus: Look; I'm going to be out in the world showing how I feel about this. I don't want it to cause any troubles between our family or for the business. I'm just... I need to know where you stand.",
        "Alan: Whatever stand you take publicly, I will support you. And that goes for Phillip, as well. Now, personal issues, we will handle behind closed doors.",
        "Attorney: Gus? They need you in the boardroom.",
        "Gus: Right. Yeah, right. Okay, this is only going to take a second.",
        "Alan: Well, Beth. I'm thrilled that you and Gus are getting along so well. I mean it's been very hard for him to get over Harley.",
        "Beth: Don't go there.",
        "Alan: I'm only a father who's concerned about the happiness of my son.",
        "Beth: My dance card is full. I have all I can handle trying to save Phillip from himself and protect my children from the fallout. The last thing I need is you trying to rearrange my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Why are you so mad? It's not like it's my fault that we...",
        "Joey: Lizzie, I'm not saying it's your fault. I'm just saying it never should have happened.",
        "Lizzie: But it did, okay? And it changed my life forever, and I can't exactly hold that in, Joey.",
        "Joey: Whoa. You promised me that you weren't going to say anything to Tammy.",
        "Lizzie: No. I won't. Just, it's going to hurt.",
        "Joey: Look, Lizzie, I'm sorry you're upset, and I appreciate you giving me a second chance with Tammy and not saying anything to her.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, well, I would do anything for you. And I hope you know that.",
        "Joey: Yeah. Um, I'm going to go back inside.",
        "Lizzie: Sure.",
        "JB: (Applause) Oh, you're good. You're really good. (Applause)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: What kind of trouble are you in?",
        "Sandy: Nothing I can't handle on my own.",
        "Reva: Well, you don't have to. I'm your mother. Let me help you with whatever this is. Is it work? School? I mean, it can't be school, because you just started taking classes again. Is it a girl? What is it?",
        "Sandy: Yeah, I wish it was a girl.",
        "Reva: You know you're acting the way you acted when you were at the police station when Alan had you arrested. You got all freaked out when they wanted to fingerprint you, which makes me think that maybe you're in some kind of trouble with the law.",
        "Sandy: Just please let this go.",
        "Reva: I can't. You're my son. And I love you. You think you're the first person in this family to have a run-in with the law? You don't have to be perfect. I'll love you no matter what.",
        "Sandy: But will you forgive me?",
        "Reva: Yes. We all make mistakes. Jonathan, please. Please just tell me what it is. Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. You dropped something.",
        "Sandy: Oh. That's mine.",
        "Sandy: I'm sorry. It's personal.",
        "Reva: Well, it's beautiful. It was the Alps, right? That's close to where you went to school.",
        "Sandy: You missed your calling. You should have been a detective.",
        "Reva: Sandy, is someone after you?",
        "Sandy: Ooh, psychic flash?",
        "Reva: No. I've just been there--the panic, the cover-up, the need to disappear. All the signs of being stalked by someone. I just want to help. I wasn't there for you when you were growing up, and you needed my protection, so please just let me help you now. Trust me enough to let me help you.",
        "Sandy: Well, why don't you trust me enough to let me do this the only way I know: On my own.",

        "JB: You're the best show in town, at the moment anyway.",
        "Lizzie: I really don't need this.",
        "JB: That guy really doesn't need you.",
        "Lizzie: For your information, he's in love with me. Okay?",
        "JB: Really? Is that why you had to drug him to get him in the sack?",
        "Lizzie: Don't...",
        "JB: Watch it.",
        "Lizzie: For your information, everything I did to get Joey was done with good intentions.",
        "JB: Oh, well, the road to hell is paved with those, baby.",
        "Joey: Do you mind sending the check?",
        "Tammy: Where'd you run off to?",
        "Joey: Just ran into someone I knew outside. So, how's your Mom?",
        "Tammy: She's okay. Is everything okay?",
        "Joey: Yeah, just... I made a decision, that's all. Tammy, I'm cutting the Spaulding's loose. I don't want anything to do with them. I don't want to work for them, period.",
        "Tammy: But Joey, your scholarship.",
        "Joey: Forget the scholarship. You know, I'll work my way through college. That's what most people do, anyway.",
        "Tammy: I know why you're doing this, and I love you for it, but you don't have to.",
        "Joey: What are you talking about?",
        "Tammy: It's because of Lizzie, isn't it? Because I was stupid enough to be jealous of her and suspicious of what was going on between the two of you after we broke up. Joey, you can't blow this opportunity. You can't give up a chance like this just because you're trying to protect me.",
        "Joey: Tammy, I just don't want anything to come between us, ever.",
        "Tammy: Hey, nothing will, okay? Especially not Lizzie. I know now. Nothing was ever really there between the two of you. It was all in her stupid head. Look, you went through so much to try to win this internship prize, and Lizzie has already pulled every number in the book on you. So, after all that, what's the worst that could happen?",
        "Joey: I think the worst that can happen already did.",

        "Bill: Thank you. Okay, that was Spaulding offices. They said Phillip is inside finishing up a meeting. All right? He's going to be coming out this door any minute now. Second thoughts?",
        "Ruth: Not one, I assure you.",
        "Bill: All right. Well, maybe we should go over the game plan just to make sure we're all on the same page.",
        "Ruth: Too late. It's over. I'm out of here.",
        "Bill: Ruth! Ruth, Ruth, Ruth. Please. You can't. You can't. What am I going to do without you? I need you.",
        "Ruth: You have a funny way of showing it.",
        "Bill: Please, please. What am I going to do? I need you.",
        "Ruth: That's not my concern.",
        "Phillip: What's the matter, William? Lovers' quarrel?",
        "Bill: (Sighs) Stay out of it, will you?",
        "Ruth: Just mail my last paycheck, please.",
        "Bill: Ruth, Ruth, Ruth. There's got to be some way we can clear this up.",
        "Ruth: Sir, I have been a loyal employee. I have done everything you asked.",
        "Bill: Yes. Yes, you have. You have. Which is why I think we need to go to the office and just... and talk.",
        "Ruth: Sir, with all due respect, we have been working out of hotel rooms and fast food restaurants ever since you and Ms. Spencer teamed up.",
        "Phillip: What's the matter? Is there trouble at spit wad enterprises?",
        "Bill: Listen, I said butt out.",
        "Phillip: I'm Phillip Spaulding. Is there anything that I can do to help?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Where'd he go? Where's big Al? I want to talk to him about his master plan.",
        "Beth: The plan to support both you and Phillip?",
        "Gus: Yeah, that's the one.",
        "Beth: You know if Alan really wanted to support Phillip, he'd rein him in.",
        "Gus: This is a little new for you, isn't it? Taking a stand against Phillip? Aren't you usually the one who defends him?",
        "Beth: I can't defend the man who threatened my mother, and is trying to bulldoze every family-run business in this town. He's not the Phillip that I know. He's not well, Gus. You must see that.",
        "Gus: You think he got out of Ravenwood a little too soon?",
        "Beth: Maybe. And you know if he did, you're in the position to do something about that.",
        "Gus: What are you saying? That I should have him committed again?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Joey, what's the real reason you don't want to take this job at Spaulding?",
        "Joey: Look, Tammy, I just feel really bad about everything that happened this summer, you know, with Lizzie coming between us, and the competition.",
        "Tammy: Joey, I love you. And maybe all the stuff that's happened this summer is going to make what we have together better and stronger. I need you, especially with this whole trial coming up, and having to relive the nightmare of Dinah shooting Hart.",
        "Joey: Tammy, I'm not going to let anything happen to you.",
        "Tammy: It's so scary. You think your life is going one way, and then the wrong person comes along, and it's over. Sorry. I don't mean to be such a downer.",
        "Joey: No. You're not being a downer. Tammy, all I want to do is take care of you.",
        "Lizzie: So, how much is it going to take for you to get lost? What, like... here you go.",
        "JB: Not even close. Hey, look, 52 pickup. Come and get them.",
        "Lizzie: You're a creep.",
        "JB: Brat.",
        "Lizzie: Loser.",
        "JB: Who's the loser?",
        "Lizzie: You know there has to be something you want from me. Otherwise, why would you be sticking around?",
        "JB: Well, you're not as dumb as you look. You want me to get lost? Introduce me to that friend of yours, the one with her head on your guy's shoulder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Ruth, come on. We can settle this. Let me take you out to lunch.",
        "Ruth: Mr. Lewis, please keep your hands to yourself.",
        "Phillip: Bill, you better be careful. This is starting to look an awful lot like harassment. Ms...",
        "Ruth: Karloff.",
        "Phillip: Karloff. Yes. If you should decide that you would like to seek employment elsewhere, please feel free to give me a call.",
        "Bill: Are you kidding me? What, do you think you can come out here and steal my personal assistant?",
        "Phillip: You're an executive assistant?",
        "Ruth: Fifteen years at Lewis Oil. Yes, sir. Until slingshot enterprises...",
        "Bill: Ruth, come on. We're just getting started.",
        "Ruth: I can take a lot, Mr. Lewis, but the way Ms. Spencer treats me, that is not acceptable.",
        "Phillip: No, I know exactly how you feel. I was married to her. Well, you probably know that Spaulding is an established company. Our employees work in offices, usually their own.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, please, you can never trust a Spaulding. Please, Ruth...",
        "Ruth: I need to keep my options open, sir.",
        "Phillip: You know I'm not doing a thing right now. I'd be happy to take you over to Spaulding and show you around, if you feel that you really are finished here.",
        "Ruth: We're finished.",
        "Bill: Ruth, please, please. You will regret this. I'm telling you right now, you're going to regret this.",
        "Phillip: Shall we?",
        "Ruth: Good-bye, Mr. Lewis.",
        "Bill: Good-bye?",
        "Phillip: Ruth, what I'm looking for is loyalty.",
        "Bill: This is never going to work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: I'm not asking you to have Phillip committed.",
        "Gus: Yeah, but you think he belongs in the nut house, or he got out a little too early, right?",
        "Beth: What do you think?",
        "Gus: I don't know. I'm not a doctor. I don't know.",
        "Beth: Okay, here's what I say. No, he's not acting like he did before he went to Ravenwood, but he's not acting like himself, either.",
        "Gus: Well, what does Rick think? How does Rick think he's doing?",
        "Beth: Well, he's not sure. But the fact is, Rick doesn't live under the same roof as him, and Phillip hasn't threatened Mel the way he threatened my mother. Look, all I want to know is, if Phillip did spiral out of control, would you be able to commit him, if you had to?",
        "Gus: \"If,\" \"would,\" \"if\"--I'm not dealing with these hypotheticals. I have a lot on my plate, you know?",
        "Beth: Okay. But it all comes down to the same thing, being true to yourself, doesn't it?",
        "Gus: (Sighs) The guy is my brother. You know, I lost a lot of family this year. I lost my sister. I lost Harley, the woman I wanted to marry. I don't...",
        "Beth: I understand that. And I know that you care about Phillip. I care about him, too, even when I want to wring his neck. But maybe... maybe that means getting Phillip the help he needs, whether he likes it or not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Okay. Okay. You've got yourself a deal. I'll back off.",
        "Sandy: Really? Thanks.",
        "Reva: Just do me a favor?",
        "Sandy: If I can.",
        "Reva: Take the duffel home and unpack it, and fight this thing out here. You'll get no interference from me, I promise, as hard as that's going to be. Look, I know your back is against the wall, but sometimes, when you know that there's family around, you don't feel so alone, and it can make all the difference in the world. And if you do need me, then I'm right here.",
        "Sandy: I'd have to cancel my flight reservation.",
        "Reva: Good idea. I'll watch your luggage for you.",
        "Sandy: I thought you trusted me.",
        "Reva: Just cancel your airline reservation, and I'll take you to breakfast.",
        "Sandy: I'll be right back.",
        "Reva: Bonjour. Jesus Reva Lewis. Oh. (Laughs) good. As I was saying, my name is Reva Lewis. I'm calling about some information. My son was a student there. Yes, Jonathan Randall. Well, I'm looking for some information about the time he spent there? Well, I'm hoping that maybe you can help me help him.",
