        "Rick: This is crazy. ",
        "Beth: I know. ",
        "Rick: This is crazy. Listen, if anyone catches us down here... ",
        "Beth: They are not going to think that you spent the night. They're just \r\ngoing to think that you came to check on James' fever like you did last night.\r\n",
        "Rick: James's fever went down with over-the-counter medication. James is \r\nfine. ",
        "Beth: And yet you didn't leave. ",
        "Rick:, No, no, I didn\u2019t. I've got to go. I've got to go. ",
        "Beth: You know... Alan is going to be away on business for at least another \r\nday. ",
        "Rick: Yes. But Mel isn't, so I have to go. Now. ",
        "Lillian: Rick. ",
        "Rick: Hey. ",
        "Lillian: Hey, I didn't know you would still be here. Is James okay? ",
        "Rick: James is fine. Yeah, why? ",
        "Lillian: I have a surprise for you. Come on in. ",
        "Mel: This has gone on long enough. ",
        "",
        "Tammy: I hate when we're apart. ",
        "Jonathan: I hate leaving you, but I think I have to right now. Alan's little \r\nwatchdog could show up at any minute and blow our cover. ",
        "Tammy: Yeah. It's pretty risky of you to come over here. ",
        "Jonathan: Look at you. ( Laughs ) You like it. You like this sneaking around \r\nand the danger. ",
        "Tammy: It does make everything more hotter, don't you think? ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. It does. ",
        "Tammy: It's kind of like when we first got together. We had to keep it from \r\nour families and stolen kisses and other stuff. ",
        "Jonathan: You, Tammy Winslow, are a very bad girl. ",
        "Tammy: And you, Jonathan Randall, are a very good teacher. ",
        "",
        "Dr. Baker: Hello, Lizzie. Did you lose your dog? ",
        "Lizzie: No. Roxy is back home in her bed. ",
        "Dr. Baker: No, no, I meant your other dog, your husband. Did he slip his \r\nleash and wander off to play in someone else's yard? ",
        "Lizzie: I am so sorry to disappoint you, Dr. Baker, but Jonathan is back home \r\nwaiting for me to come back with our breakfast. We're going to have it in bed.\r\n",
        "Waitress: Here you go. ",
        "Lizzie: Thank you. ",
        "Waitress: You're welcome. ",
        "Lizzie: Oh, so you can report back to granddad, croissants and sticky buns.\r\n",
        "Dr. Baker: You know, that looks awfully heavy. Let me carry it back to the \r\nhotel for you. Someone in your condition shouldn't be carrying heavy things like \r\nthis. Expectant moms can never be too careful. Come this way. ",
        "",
        "Movie patron: ( Crying ) Thank you. Love is so painful. ",
        "Cassie: Tell me about it. ",
        "",
        "( Knocking at the door ) ",
        "Josh: Reva. ",
        "Reva: You don't look so good. Rough night on the town these last few nights? \r\nWord travels fast. How bad is it? ",
        "Josh: Well, basically I'm trying to figure out if I'm hung-over or if I'm \r\njust still flat-out drunk. ",
        "",
        "Rick: Hey. What a nice surprise, sweetheart. I wasn't expecting you to be \r\nhere. ",
        "Mel: You know, Rick, this is between me, Beth, and Alan. You do your job, \r\nI'll do mine. ",
        "Beth: Your job? ",
        "Mel: As Lizzie and Jonathan\u2019s attorney. What did you think I meant? ",
        "Beth: Nothing. I'm just a little fuzzy. I was up all night with James. ",
        "Mel:, Oh, is he doing better? ",
        "Beth: Yes, yes, he is, thanks to your husband's expert care. What can I do \r\nfor you? Can I get you some coffee? ",
        "Mel: No, no. Where's Alan? ",
        "Beth: Alan is out of town. Is there something I can do for you? ",
        "Mel: Yes, you can give this to your husband. It's a cease-and-desist order. \r\nHis spy, Dr. Baker, is getting one, too. They are through harassing my clients, \r\nokay? Do you realize what Alan\u2019s been up to? ",
        "Beth: Yes, yes, I have a pretty good idea. And I don't approve, but you know \r\nhow he is. ",
        "Mel: Well, he's making it very difficult for Lizzie and Jonathan. It's very \r\nhard for two people to have a marriage without somebody stepping in between them \r\npurposely. ",
        "Beth: Yes, yes, I couldn't agree more. That's why I've invited Jonathan and \r\nLizzie over for brunch as a way of welcoming him into the fold. ",
        "Lillian: Why don't you stay, too, okay? And you, too, Rick. I mean, you're \r\nboth practically family. Don't you think that's a good idea, Beth? ",
        "",
        "Lizzie: Thank you. You can go now. ",
        "Dr. Baker: If I've brought it this far, I might as well take it right on in.\r\n",
        "Lizzie: You've really done enough. ",
        "Dr. Baker: No. ",
        "Lizzie: Thank you. ",
        "Dr. Baker: I insist. Besides this will give me a chance to say hi to your \r\nhusband. ",
        "Lizzie: And get his day off to rotten start? I don't think so. Besides, \r\nJonathan said he was going to take Roxy for a walk. ( Dog barks ) ",
        "Dr. Baker: There goes that theory. Open the door, Lizzie. ",
        "Lizzie: Okay, but I'm warning you, Jonathan could have gone out for a \r\nnewspaper or even gone for a run. He always exercises. ",
        "Jonathan: Honey, pumpkin, is that you? Oh goody. You brought breakfast, we \r\nwere starving. What's up, Doc? Moonlighting as a bellhop? Is Alan not paying you \r\nenough money? ",
        "Dr. Baker: You're going to screw up, Randall. It's just a matter of time \r\nbefore I get proof for the judge that this marriage is a sham. ",
        "Jonathan: What do you think, Roxy? ",
        "Dr. Baker: See you later. ",
        "Lizzie: How great were you? How great was he, Roxy? How great was he? ",
        "Jonathan: That's me, I'm great. ",
        "Lizzie: I didn't think you were going to make it back from Tammy\u2019s on time. \r\nIt's so dangerous by the way. ",
        "Jonathan:, No drama. I'm too slick for Dr. B. But he'll deliver our message \r\nto your grandfather. ",
        "Lizzie: I know another way you can deliver a message to my granddad. Come \r\nwith me to the mansion for brunch today. ",
        "Jonathan: I can\u2019t. I'm meeting up with Tammy. ",
        "Lizzie: Listen. My mom invited us. My grandmother and my Aunt Alex are going \r\nto be there. If we can put on a good show for them, we might be able to get them \r\non our side. Then if they can get to granddad, he'll call off Dr. Baker and you \r\nand Tammy won't have to sneak around anymore. ",
        "",
        "Tammy: Double butter. ",
        "Cassie: Tammy, what are you doing here? ",
        "Movie patron: Shh. ",
        "Tammy: Same thing you are. So the popcorn, the movie, does it help? ",
        "Cassie: Does what help? ",
        "Tammy: Does all this help you forget about how much you miss a certain guy?\r\n",
        "Cassie: For a little while. ",
        "",
        "Reva: Let me get you.... ",
        "Josh: You know what? I really don't need your help, thank you. ",
        "Reva: Sure you don\u2019t. ",
        "Josh: I'm fine. ",
        "Reva: Is that H.B.'s hangover remedy? Did you remember to put the \r\nworcestershire sauce in it? ",
        "Josh: ( Laughs ) ",
        "Reva: Oh, knew it. ",
        "Josh: Why are you here? ",
        "Reva: Oh, I'm sorry. I should have called first. Do you have company? ",
        "Josh: You mean is Cassie here? I mean, that's what you really want to know, \r\nright? ",
        "Reva: Is she? ",
        "Josh: No. She's not, I told you. We decided not to pursue whatever it was \r\nthat we had. ",
        "Reva: Why? ",
        "Josh: Reva, why are you here? ",
        "Reva:, Hey, you know what? Don't take this out on me. ",
        "Josh: Hey, you know what? ",
        "Reva: The fact that you had too much to drink. ",
        "Josh: When I took you to the hospital after I found you at the top of the \r\nlighthouse, passed out, you made it clear to me that your health is none of my \r\nbusiness. Well, ditto. Answer the question. ",
        "Reva: I didn't know you'd be here. I came by to pick up a few things and \r\nlater I'll pick up more because I'm moving out. ",
        "Josh:, You know, this is your house, too. I mean, if you want it, we can work \r\nthat out. ",
        "Reva: That's okay. Because I won't be here long. ",
        "Josh:, Oh, really? Where are you going? ",
        "Reva: Just meant that, you know, I've already got someplace else. ",
        "Josh: Where? ",
        "Reva: Well, right now at the Beacon. ",
        "Josh: Alone? Oh, I'm sorry. Ask a stupid question. You're moving in with \r\nBilly, aren't you? You know, you're not going to be able to fit much stuff in \r\nBilly\u2019s room. ",
        "Reva: Do you mind if I take this? Because I always kind of liked it and you \r\nnever really found much use for it. ",
        "Josh: So is that a yes? Are you moving in with Billy? ",
        "Reva: Change is good, to move on with life. It's healthy. You know, maybe \r\nthat's always been our problem. We always held on too tight, never really knew \r\nwhen to let go. ",
        "Josh: It doesn't seem to be a problem for you anymore. ",
        "Reva: Doesn't seem to be a problem for you, either, but that\u2019s... I'm glad. I \r\nmean, it makes me happy, Joshua, I mean, because it's amazing how both of us \r\nhave been able to embrace the change. You have your hospital project and I \r\nhave.... ",
        "Josh: Billy. You have Billy. You know what? Actually, why don't the two of \r\nyou move in here, you know? There's only one of me. ",
        "Reva: That could change. Besides, this is your family's home. You worked very \r\nhard to move it here from Oklahoma. ",
        "Josh: For you, Reva. I moved the house here for you. I thought it could be a \r\ndream that we could share together. ",
        "Reva: Well, dreams change. People move on. Like I said, you know, you could \r\nfind another hot mama to move in here with you, someone to fluff your pillows \r\nfor you and make you bacon and eggs in the morning. Someone to love you the way \r\nyou deserve to be loved. ",
        "",
        "Cassie: Oh, you gotta love Hollywood. They smile, they kiss, the end, the \r\ncredits roll. You want to stay for the next one? ",
        "Tammy: I think I've had enough estrogen for one day. ",
        "Cassie: Come on, it'll have a happy ending. ",
        "Tammy: Hey, we will, too, you know. ",
        "Cassie: Tammy, how do you stay so upbeat? Your boyfriend just married someone \r\nelse. Someone who is carrying his child, no less. ",
        "Tammy: It's not a real marriage. ",
        "Cassie: Still. ",
        "Tammy: Mom, I know that Jonathan loves me and I believe in him and I believe \r\nin what we have. So I'm okay. ",
        "Cassie: I used to believe. Until the weight of the world crushed me. ",
        "Tammy: ( Laughs ) You are so old. Mom, if you're meant to be with Uncle Josh, \r\nyou will be. ",
        "Cassie: Is that what keeps a smile on your face? You just have that much \r\nhope? ",
        "Tammy: That and sneaking in visits here and there with you- know-who. In \r\nfact, later .... ",

        "Lizzie: Here come the newlyweds. ",
        "Alexandra: Hi, sweetie. Hello, darling. Jonathan. ",
        "Jonathan: Auntie Alex. Is that okay if I call you that? ",
        "Alexandra: If it'll keep you from calling me anything worse. ",
        "Jonathan: Nana! ",
        "Lillian: No, no, no. Lillian will be just fine. ",
        "Jonathan: Okay. ",
        "Jonathan: Okay, Lillian. ",
        "Lizzie: We just want you guys to know that we're really excited to be here. \r\nAnd we know that you're putting in an effort and we appreciate it. Right, \r\nJonathan? ",
        "Jonathan: Yes. Yes. Just when you thought this family couldn't get any more \r\nscrewed up. ( Laughs ) Right? Right. Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Seriously, \r\nI want you guys to know I am totally committed to making sure that Lizzie and \r\nour kid are both as happy as they possibly can be. ",
        "Alexandra: That's lovely. And how long did you rehearse that, dear? ",
        "Jonathan: Well, I'll tell you if you give me one of those. ",
        "Alexandra: Extra spicy. ",
        "Jonathan: Oh, how did you know? ",
        "Lizzie: Okay, Mom. What is the cook making for us today? ",
        "Lillian: What? ",
        "Alexandra: Nothing. It's just there's something about it him that reminds me \r\nof Lujack. ",
        "Lizzie: Mel, are you going to have brunch with us? ",
        "Mel: No, sorry. I just came by to drop off some paperwork. The cease and \r\ndesist order that we talked about. ",
        "Lizzie: Oh, good. Dr. Baker followed us all way home from Main Street. ",
        "Mel:, Well, he's not supposed to be in the same room with you, so if you guys \r\nsee him near you, just either of you, please, just call me or contact the police \r\ndirectly, okay? ",
        "Lillian: Mel, please stay for brunch. ",
        "Mel: Lillian, I would love to but I have to meet with a new client. ",

        "Jonathan: Why not, Dr. Rick? ",
        "Rick: I've got some paperwork to catch up on. ",
        "Lizzie: No, you have to stay. We need another guy around, before Jonathan \r\nwill feel will be all ganged up on. ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. ",
        "Lizzie: Come on, please, especially with dad not being here. I really want \r\nyou to stay. Please? ",
        "Mel: You should, Rick. ",
        "Rick: Honey, can I talk to you for a second? Do you really have to go \r\nsomeplace or is that just an excuse because you don't have any plans? I'd love \r\nto take you out to get a bite to eat. ",
        "Mel:, I do have to work, Rick, but I'm free for dinner tonight. ",
        "Rick: You could do dinner? Well, that's great, honey. ",
        "Mel: Yeah, it's just dinner. ",
        "Rick: It's just dinner but it's a start. It's a start. Thanks. ",

        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) ",
        "Alexandra: A toast to the newlyweds. Now, whatever other differences we may \r\nhave in this room, think, I think we all agree that all we want for Lizzie\u2019s \r\nbaby is health, happiness and to be loved. ",
        "Lillian: And blond hair. ",
        "Lizzie: Blue eyes. ",

        "Jonathan: Yeah, I'd be happy to. ",
        "Beth: What the hell are you trying to pull in there? ",
        "Jonathan: I'm just trying to be a good little Spaulding, Mother. ",
        "Beth: You call me that again, and I will slap you across the face. Now, I \r\nhave kept up my end of the bargain. I have done everything to support you and \r\nLizzie, including organizing this little get-together in there, so lay off the \r\nwisecracks about.... ",
        "Jonathan: What? Oh, you mean about you and the doctor getting it on? ",
        "Beth: Shh. Stop it. ",
        "Jonathan: Look, if you think that little get-together brunch in there is what \r\nI want you to do for me, people sit around and pretend that we like each other, \r\nyou are crazy. You are crazy. You're going to have to do a lot more than that \r\nfor me to keep your secret. Yeah. ",

They want to donate \r\nnurses' uniforms for the first two years of our operation... what? Okay, so \r\nwe're not... we're not whatever we were or almost were. Okay, but we're still \r\nworking together and this project may have been your dream to begin with, Josh, \r\nbut it is mine now, too.

I don't care what Tammy says, I \r\ndon't care what happens in the movies. This is you and me and I can't let myself \r\nhope, because you know what? Hawk was right. Everyone is right.
