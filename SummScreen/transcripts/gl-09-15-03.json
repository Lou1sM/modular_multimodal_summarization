        "Beth: Could you just throw me my purse over there, please? You know, you don't get this. You don't understand because maybe you do this kind of thing all the time. Do you do this kind of thing all the time?",

        "Eden: What? Why did you do that?",
        "Bill: Well, Tony's sitting over there beating himself up. But she was in the car. She's on her way over here right now.",
        "Eden: What? You think having her come here now is going to fix that. Look at him. He's smashed!",

        "Christopher: You felt something.",
        "Reva: I'm overreacting. I am. And you know these feelings I get, I'm wrong more times than I'm right. It's nothing, Christopher. Really.",

        "Reva: Yeah. It was just a momentary panic thing, you know. It scared me. It did scare me. It did. But it was panic. It's one of those panicky feelings you get, like, when you're flying across country and half way there you get the feeling, like, you left the stove at your house. It was a flash. I mean people get flashes of panic all the time. Okay, maybe you don't, but i do. And I'm still just kind of sorting through all of these feelings that I get. And it really is nothing. It was nothing. But it's Shayne.",

        "Eden: Well, I just didn't want to make things worse for them. I mean Tony- seeing Marah when he's drunk like this could send him over the edge.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, look at them. It didn't.",
        "Eden: Yeah, but it could have. Look, Marah is my friend. And I just don't want to see her hurt.",
        "Bill: Marah is my cousin. I wouldn't call her over here if I thought she was going to get hurt. Now, look, these two-- they got a lot of problems to work out, but they've been through too much just to give up.",

        "Eden: Wait, what?",
        "Bill: Us. Come on, we worked through a lot of stuff to get where we are. It wasn't easy, but we stuck it out, why? Because it was worth it. And I think Tony and Marah should have that same shot, right?",

        "Jeffrey: Well, I'm not exactly a fish expert, but...",
        "Beth: Okay, well, you see, that's what I thought. These are probably harmless little guppies.",

        "Beth: Well, no.",
        "Jeffrey: No.",
        "Beth: Okay, so you were going to stick your hand in there and risk death by fish just to get those keys for me.",

        "Jeffrey: No, sorry. I already checked.",
        "Beth: Maybe we should call someone.",

        "Beth: I can't.",
        "Jeffrey: It's just a thought.",
        "Beth: Well, you love this, aren't you? You probably threw those keys in there on purpose so that you would trap me here.",
        "Jeffrey: Excuse me? In the first place, I didn't throw the keys in there, okay. You did. And in the second place, contrary to popular opinion, I don't go around trying to trap women. As a matter of fact, normally I have to beat them off with a stick.",
        "Beth: Oh, well, that's a charming thing to say, isn't it?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you were charmed a little while ago, weren't you? You were too, Beth. You were relaxed, you were happy, you were smiling, and you were having a good time. Until realty decided to make an appearance and then you decided to go awl.",
        "Beth: I didn't go awl. And, you know, awl doesn't make sense in that sentence anyhow. You know, I hate that. I hate it when things just don't make sense.",
        "Jeffrey: Awl, Beth. You went awl: \"Away without leave.\" As in the gorgeous, fun woman that i was with decided to go awl. And now I'm left with... Well, I'm left with you.",

        "Jeffrey: (Laughing)",
        "Beth: ...Where food is served. Don't... Don't laugh at me.",
        "Jeffrey: A civilized member of the community? What, are you running for office?",
        "Beth: Okay, maybe it sounded a little bit rigid.",
        "Jeffrey: A little bit rigid. You sounded like you got a rod up your...",
        "Beth: Stop. Stop it.",
        "Jeffrey: Up your nose. I was going to say nose, Beth. Listen, I know you're a mother, okay. I respect that. But you're also a woman, Beth, and we've got to respect that.",
        "Beth: Jeffrey, you don't... You don't understand. First, Lizzie...",
        "Jeffrey: Every time you have a good time you don't have to feel guilty about Lizzie, okay? I mean, just because you decided to spend some time on yourself doesn't mean that you have any less love for your daughter, okay. You've been wrapped up in Lizzie's problems for so long, you've got to give yourself a break, Beth. You deserve it. You do.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marah: What were you doing here tonight, Tony? Getting drunk? Getting into fights? If what we had is so wrong, then why do you feel the need to go out and get trashed? What are trying to forget about? You want to forget about me? You want to forget about us? Then why is it so hard if it's so wrong?",
        "Tony: Look, i didn't say that it was easy.",
        "Marah: All right, then fine. I'll make it easy. Tell me. Tell me again how wrong we are.",
        "Tony: Marah, just...",
        "Marah: Say it! No, I want to hear it. I want you to make me believe it.",
        "Tony: It's over. Okay, you, and me we're done. That's it. And it's going to be a hell of a lot worse if we don't just let it go now and admit it. Look. Look at your shirt.",
        "Marah: I don't care about the shirt! We were happy, okay? I want to get that back. Do you really think that you're going to be happier without me?",
        "Tony: I don't know. I don't know. Maybe. Maybe. You haven't left me alone long enough for me to figure it out. I can't handle this, okay?",
        "Marah: Tony, wait. Please... (Cell phone) what?! Oh, my god! What? Where? Okay, I'll be right there.",
        "Tony: What... What is it? What happened? What?",

        "Jeffrey: Well, Beth, it wasn't the tea. It wasn't the phase of the moon. I don't think it was anything except for you and me. Two people. A beautiful woman and a lucky guy trying to spend some time together. That's all.",
        "Beth: I wish that it could be that easy.",
        "Jeffrey: It is that easy. Well, at least it was anyway until, well, you know...",
        "Beth: Until I ruined it.",
        "Jeffrey: I didn't say that. All right, come on, let's go.",
        "Beth: What?",
        "Jeffrey: Let's go. Let's get out of here.",
        "Beth: Look, Jeffrey, I'm sorry about all of...",
        "Jeffrey: Did I ask you to apologize?",
        "Beth: No.",
        "Jeffrey: No. Okay. So, don't.",

        "Phillip: Do I know how late it is? Yes. Do you know how off this trust paperwork is? No. No, it's not what I asked you for. Not at all. Well, what you can do is make it right. I will expect a fresh draft on my desk first thing in the morning. (Phone rings) hello? Oh, well, it only took you a day and a half to get back to me. Everybody's busy. Did you finish the Merton report? Did you finish it? Well, then why are bothering me? Call me back when it's done. (Phone rings) hello!",
        "Olivia: Not your phone?",
        "Phillip: I thought it was. Where's my pen?",
        "Olivia: This one? Are you all right?",
        "Phillip: Sorry. I can't concentrate in a bar. If you see me heading this way with a briefcase in my hand again, turn me around.",
        "Olivia: How did you end up here?",
        "Phillip: Well, I obviously thought I'd get something done here-- at least more than at home.",
        "Olivia: Why? What's going on at home? Is it Lizzie?",
        "Phillip: No, she's fine. She went to bed. She finished her session with Christopher Lang ham. Thank god.",
        "Olivia: Sounds like it was a pretty rough hour.",
        "Phillip: Oh, well... One down. God knows how many more left to go.",
        "Olivia: Hey, why were you working here so late at night? Was it some kind of new acquisition?",
        "Phillip: No.",
        "Olivia: I'm asking because I just get the feeling that it might involve me.",
        "Phillip: Well, close. It's about the baby.",
        "Olivia: What about the baby?",
        "Phillip: I had my lawyer draw up a trust for her and I amended my will so that she will be provided for no matter happens.",
        "Olivia: Well, she'll have a trust before she has a name.",
        "Phillip: No, I think it's important. I think it's important to plan these things now.",
        "Olivia: There's logic to it. Look, I know that you think that you fell short of taking care of Lizzie.",
        "Phillip: Failed. The word is failed.",
        "Olivia: What did dr. Lang ham says about Lizzie?",
        "Phillip: He said that he would treat her as long as he feels that he's doing some good. And if he feels that he isn't, then he will recommend that she be hospitalized.",
        "Olivia: How do you feel about that?",
        "Phillip: Absolutely. If that's what's best for her absolutely. I'm through making mistakes at her expense.",
        "Olivia: Look, she's at home. She's getting the care that she needs, right?",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm.",
        "Olivia: Well, isn't that cause for optimism? Maybe even some relief?",
        "Phillip: You know, I'm going to be up half the night working on these things as it is. I got to go.",

        "Beth: You know, I really do have to go.",
        "Jeffrey: I know. I know. You keep saying that.",
        "Beth: Jeffrey, about what I said about this not being simple. You understand the position that I'm in.",
        "Jeffrey: I understand that you take that very seriously, yeah.",
        "Beth: Oh! I thought you said that those fish were poisonous.",
        "Jeffrey: They are.",
        "Beth: But...",
        "Jeffrey: Life is just full of risks, Beth. Sometimes you just got to take a chance. Ready to go?",

        "Reva: What is it? Tell me.",
        "Josh: Reva, I was there.",
        "Reva: I know. I know. You're the one who saved Shayne.",
        "Josh: No. No, I didn't just come across Shayne and marina. It was... It was my car. I was the one who hit them.",
        "Reva: No, Joshua. No, no. That's not what happened.",
        "Josh: Reva, I was rushing, because I knew I needed to get Shayne home for his meeting with the guy from... From the cubs. I don't... I don't really know if I was going too fast or not. I just know that the roads were slick and I didn't see the car until... It just... It happened fast.",
        "Reva: No. No. It wasn't you.",
        "Josh: Reva, I didn't even know it was Shayne until I saw marina. I tried to help him. I tried.",
