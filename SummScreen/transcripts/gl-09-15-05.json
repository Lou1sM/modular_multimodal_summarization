Alan goes to the hospital complaining of pains and calls Beth to tell her to get back in time for the board meeting at Spaulding.

Lizzie later comes to visit Alan and tells him that nothing he can do will keep her away from Coop, she later arranges it so that neither Alan or Beth will be available for the board meeting.

        "Coop: Lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: I love this song! ( Music playing )",
        "Coop: Yeah. I love this song, too. Aren't we supposed to be keeping some distance between each other?",
        "Lizzie: Yes, I know. We have been, and I've been a really good girl.",
        "Coop: Yeah, I'm sure you've been a very good girl, but this is a very dangerous situation right now.",
        "Lizzie: I know. Don't you love it? I'm tired of being a good girl.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse: Sir? Can you tell us what's bothering you?",
        "Alan: Yes, my head's hurting, my stomach, my back. I hurt all over.",
        "Nurse: Well, we'll have the doctor take a look at you.",
        "Guard: I'm going to go call in and let them know we got here.",
        "Alan: Beth, look, I want you to hurry back to Springfield. The Spaulding board is meeting this afternoon to elect a new CEO. Now, Gus thinks he is going to be confirmed, but I have a little surprise for him and I want you to deliver it. So hurry home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Thank you for coming. I needed you.",
        "Billy: I do love to hear a woman say that.",
        "Reva: I'm having one hell of a day and it's not even lunchtime yet.",
        "Billy: You know, you sounded a little shaky in your message. Look, you must have taken on that rock-climbing hill and now you're stuck with a cane.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) You are the only one that can make me laugh about feeling lousy.",
        "Billy: Still hurt?",
        "Reva: Yeah, my back hurts. But I didn't call you about my back, I called you about something else that hurts.",
        "Billy: Okay, well, tell me about it.",
        "Reva: ( Sighs ) You already know what it is. It's Joshua.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: \"I'm available?\" That's what you just said. Because I, you know, I just think of myself as your boss.",
        "Stephanie: Well, they're not mutually exclusive, I hope.",
        "Josh: This meeting is not turning out at all like I thought it was going to be.",
        "Stephanie: And isn't that a good thing? By the way, what is the dating policy at the station?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: You did a good job. You want some dessert?",
        "Robbie: No, I want to go see Mommy.",
        "Danny: Okay, well, she's getting out of the hospital later today. Why don't we wait until then?",
        "Robbie: No, I want to see Mommy now.",
        "Danny: We'll head over there in a little while, all right? Why don't you go work on that coloring book that Marina gave you? It's on the counter. Okay? Go ahead. What's up? You've been pretty quiet.",
        "Marina: I guess I don't have much to say.",
        "Danny: If you did have something to say, what would it be about? Michelle?",
        "Marina: She's been on my mind, yeah. But not the way you think.",
        "Danny: Okay, in what way?",
        "Marina: All the stuff that she said about you being there the other night, after the accident.",
        "Danny: She hit her head in the car crash. She was... her mind was just doing a number on her.",
        "Marina: You know what, Danny? I just don't buy that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Michelle? Are you all right?",
        "Michelle: Hey. I wondered when you were going to come by.",
        "Edmund: Well, here I am.",
        "Michelle: I just want you to know, I remember.",
        "Edmund: What?",
        "Michelle: I remember every single thing you did.",
        "Edmund: Michelle, really, I can explain.",
        "Michelle: Why? Why? What you did just speaks for itself. You took me in when I had nowhere else to go. And you were kind to me and you tried to comfort me when I didn't know what to do about my baby. You heard what happened, right?",
        "Edmund: The accident. Yes, Michelle, I'm very sorry.",
        "Michelle: They tell me that my baby died, but it's weird. It's so jumbled in my mind. I feel like that it happened to somebody else, that I'm just hearing about it.",
        "Edmund: So you really don't remember anything about that night?",
        "Michelle: Little bits and pieces, you know? They don't really don't make a lot of sense. I wish that I had listened to you before and stayed in your suite because things could have been different right now, you know? I might be holding my baby.",
        "Edmund: No, Michelle, you can't do this. We all make mistakes. We all make mistakes and you just can't dwell on them. Don't dwell on them and move on.",
        "Michelle: I'm really glad you came by.",
        "Edmund: Well, I wish I could have come by sooner, but I wanted to give you time to grieve and heal.",
        "Michelle: It's funny because I'm in so much pain right now. But I can't grieve.",
        "Edmund: It must be very difficult to completely let go when you've carried a child for so long.",
        "Michelle: Well, it's not just that. I just... there's something in me that tells me this baby is still alive, you know, and that voice just doesn't go away. Maybe it's because my memory's so messed up about that night and I'm just clinging to the idea of it.",
        "Edmund: Michelle, I really think you have to stop torturing yourself.",
        "Michelle: Well, the torture is just not knowing what happened, you know? I'm an expert on memory loss. I know what it takes from you and what it hides from you. But this time I'm going to do something about it.",
        "Edmund: Like what?",
        "Michelle: Whatever it takes to remember every single minute of that night. I'm going to make sure I know exactly what happened to me and my baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: If you think that I was with Michelle... how could I have been with Michelle that night? I was with you.",
        "Marina: I don't know. It's just... it's possible that someone was there.",
        "Danny: Who? Someone that she thought was me?",
        "Marina: You can't automatically rule it out.",
        "Danny: Okay, Honey, I'm sorry, please don't take offense at this, but you're kind of thinking maybe a little too much like a rookie cop. Don't you think?",
        "Marina: Hey!",
        "Danny: Well, I'm sorry, but come on. That doesn't make any sense.",
        "Marina: Danny, I realize that this is Michelle that we're talking about, okay? And I understand that this baby might actually have been yours.",
        "Danny: That doesn't matter. That's not the point.",
        "Marina: But I'm just looking at the facts, all right? Michelle seems pretty convinced that she had that baby after she got away from the car and that the baby was born safely. Right?",
        "Danny: Marina, the baby died. It died. And I'm trying to help Michelle heal. I'm trying to help her to let go. These kinds of questions will not help her do that.",
        "Robbie: Daddy, can we go see Mommy now?",
        "Danny: Okay, sure. You got it. You want to come?",
        "Marina: No. You guys go, and you say hello to your mommy for me, okay?",
        "Robbie: I will. Come on, Daddy, let's go.",
        "Danny: All right, all right, all right. I'm coming, I'm coming. Hey. You okay about this?",
        "Marina: Fine.",
        "Danny: Hm?",
        "Marina: I can let it go.",
        "Danny: Okay. Thank you. I'll call you later.",
        "Marina: I know why you'd want to drop this, Danny, but I don't think I should.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Stephanie, I... I don't know that I feel comfortable with this.",
        "Stephanie: Because you're my boss or because of your wife?",
        "Josh: Does it matter?",
        "Stephanie: Not if you say yes.",
        "Josh: To what?",
        "Stephanie: ( Laughs ) So, is your wife still your wife?",
        "Josh: Oh.",
        "Stephanie: ( Laughs )",
        "Josh: Yes.",
        "Stephanie: Hm. But you are separated? I mean, everyone knows that.",
        "Josh: Boy, news really travels fast, doesn't it?",
        "Stephanie: Yes, it does. Especially in a news room. ( Laughter ) So, I'm just trying to position myself and make sure that I don't miss out.",
        "Josh: On what?",
        "Stephanie: Honey, you are a major catch. That's the one thing that all the women at the news station can actually agree on. You're smart, you're self- assured, you're considerate, and handsome as hell.",
        "Josh: Stop, okay. Just...",
        "Stephanie: Please, I am making my pitch here.",
        "Josh: This is freaking me out.",
        "Stephanie: I am making my pitch here, and trust me, I am up against some serious competition.",
        "Josh: Nice pitch.",
        "Stephanie: ( Laughs ) I'm just being straight with you. And look, I don't have any agenda, no neuroses, no emotional baggage or anybody that I am currently seeing at the moment. Bottom line: I think that I am exactly what you're looking for. Mm-hmm. I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: And then Cassie asked Josh and me to be the Godparents for the baby, a beacon of love and stability for this little person.",
        "Billy: Oh, and there you are...",
        "Reva: There we are, you know, with this beautiful baby, with the minister talking about commitment, with Edmund, with Cassie and everyone else sitting there just so full of hope for the future.",
        "Billy: And you and Josh wondering if there's ever going to be a future. Ouch.",
        "Reva: Yeah, ouch.",
        "Billy: Hey, you were the one who pushed him away.",
        "Reva: Yeah. I did a little too good a job.",
        "Billy: Oh, now you want some sympathy? Darling, you might have wasted a quarter on that call.",
        "Reva: Billy, can't you see that I'm stuck here?",
        "Billy: Hey, you got exactly what you wanted.",
        "Reva: No. No. What I wanted was for Joshua to be happy. What I wanted was for us to be happy together, but we seem to be going in the opposite direction.",
        "Billy: Well, so you gave him a little push. Just for his own good.",
        "Reva: I needed time to deal with my own mess, okay? But Josh deserved better than to be told by me that he wasn't enough for me.",
        "Billy: A little hard to be happy with someone when you hear that to your face.",
        "Reva: Yeah, I hit him with that one right between the eyes.",
        "Billy: Now you want an ice bag to make it all feel good.",
        "Reva: Billy, I know there's not an easy fix for this but at least I'm admitting that there is a problem that's serious.",
        "Billy: Well, we've got to start somewhere, don't we?",
        "Reva: Oh, thanks for being so sympathetic.",
        "Billy: Okay, look. Josh got limits. You push him. You push him too much once too often, he's not going to be there. He might not even be there when you come looking for him. I learned this the hard way with Vanessa.",
        "Reva: Well, what am I supposed to do, then?",
        "Billy: Well, you've got to sort this thing out quick and you've got to let Josh know that it's for the best, and you've just got to hope that he'll be there when you're done. Hey, have you had anything to eat since you took that tumble?",
        "Reva: ( Groans )",
        "Billy: Okay, let us go over to Company and we'll get something to eat. You can't figure these things out on an empty stomach. ( Chuckles )",
        "Reva: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Mm-mm.",
        "Lizzie: No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. Please. I know I wasn't supposed to come and see you but listen, I was worried and I wanted to check on you.",
        "Coop: You wanted to check on me? Fine. You've checked. All right, now, why don't you just go to your safe place. Please.",
        "Lizzie: You know, I know you don't think my grandfather was involved in those tires falling on you, but he was and who knows what he's planning on next?",
        "Coop: Which is why you should go back. I don't want you to get caught in the crossfire. Not to mention, we don't even have any proof that it even was Alan.",
        "Lizzie: Well, Harley doesn't have any proof and she told you to play it safe, and you listen to her.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, what I don't get is why he would want to come after me so hard. I mean, all we were doing was just talking about a weekend in Cancun. Big deal, right?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, big deal.",
        "Coop: See, it seems to me that if Alan wanted to send a message, he would do it over something a little bit more drastic. Let's say-- I don't know-- you and I getting married.",
        "Lizzie: ( Scoffs ) That's a crazy idea.",
        "Coop: Isn't it? I had a little chat with your Rent-a-Minister.",
        "Lizzie: Oh.",
        "Coop: Yeah, \"oh.\" You weren't planning a trip, Lizzie. You were planning a honeymoon.",
        "Lizzie: Look, I don't know who told you what but it's not what you're thinking.",
        "Coop: No? I must have it all wrong?",
        "Lizzie: Absolutely.",
        "Coop: I'll tell you what. How about I tell you what I know and then you can just tell me how far off the truth I really am? You sold me on this amazing getaway, location scouting for WSPR in Cancun. ( Gasps ) Wow. Only, there were no locations to scout because there really wasn't a Cancun trip, now, was there? Maybe you just figured that by the time I showed up at the minister's place, you'd start your little sneak attack wedding and I'd say, \"Oh, okay, change of pace, I'll go with it,\" and then you could just slip your little ring on my finger. Or maybe perhaps, Lizzie, you figured that I wouldn't notice that you were standing there in a white wedding gown with the minister with prayer book in hand, and that by the time I put it all together, I'd already be Mr. Lizzie Spaulding. Well, guess what, Lizzie. I figured it out. How far off the truth am I now?",
        "Lizzie: Actually, I was hoping you'd be just as psyched about the idea as I was.",
        "Coop: We've been through this a million times, all right? You proposed to me and I said \"No.\"",
        "Lizzie: It wasn't exactly a no \"No,\" Coop. It was like a maybe. Especially after all those nice things you said to my mom about me. You made me feel like you loved me.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, you lied to me! All right, I don't want to be lied to and I certainly do not want to be led around like a little dog by the nose.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, well what about that course at Oxford? Were you going to tell me about that if I wasn't standing there? Or were you just planning on leaving?",
        "Coop: That writing course is a completely different thing.",
        "Lizzie: Coop, listen, I know that the wedding was... it was a big deal, but listen. I can't lose you, okay? I just... I can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: I demand to see a doctor. Do you have any idea who I am?",
        "Nurse: Somebody who needs to chill. Big time.",
        "Guard: In the old days, she'd have been right out the door, huh?",
        "Alan: Yes, and you'd be right out with her. If I were you, I would make sure that your star prisoner here gets the medical attention that he needs, and now.",
        "Guard: My eyes will not be off of you for one second.",
        "Alan: Beth. Are you on the plane? Good. Look, I've run into a little delay, so we may not be able to meet before the board meeting. So I need to brief you now. I just want you to know that I've been in touch with some of our allies on the board, some of the old guard, and they are going to back you 100%. Yes, surprise. Gus will not be CEO of Spaulding Enterprises under any circumstances. You will. So hurry home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Stephanie, your offer was very interesting.",
        "Stephanie: Interesting?",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, God, I'm doomed. Oh, no. ( Laughs )",
        "Josh: No. Wait, wait, wait. No, look, you're an attractive woman.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: You've experienced a terrible loss, not to mention severe physical trauma.",
        "Michelle: I know that, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Right. So you need time to rest so you can heal and move on with your life.",
        "Michelle: You know, I appreciate your concern, I do, and I really do. Everything that you did for me.",
        "Edmund: Right. Michelle, about everything I did, I would like to keep that between us, if that's all right.",
        "Michelle: Why?",
        "Edmund: Well, what it was was a show of support. A simple show of support, but it was something that was very personal for me and I'd just rather it not be broadcast around town. I'm sure you understand. Here you go.",
        "Michelle: Well, no, actually I don't because I think most people in this town need to know that side of you.",
        "Edmund: Well, believe me, it's not necessary.",
        "Michelle: Well, it is for me, okay, because it would make me feel good to let people know how terrific you are. Like Cassie. Think about the look on her face if she knew that you had taken care of me in the last few days of my pregnancy.",
        "Edmund: Well, that's really very nice of you, Michelle, but I... do you have anyone to drive you home? The nurse told me you're being discharged today.",
        "Michelle: Oh. Actually, Rick was supposed to take me, but he can't.",
        "Edmund: Well, then may I? Please? Perhaps we can further discuss your public relations campaign on my behalf in the car.",
        "Michelle: Okay.",
        "Edmund: Good. Good. Let's go.",
        "Danny: Hey. Hey. Where are you going?",
        "Michelle: Oh, Edmund was just going to give me a lift home.",
        "Danny: You were? Huh. Well, Buddy, look who it is.",
        "Robbie: Mommy!",
        "Michelle: Oh, hey. Come here. Give me a big hug.",
        "Danny: Did she ask you to give her a ride home?",
        "Edmund: Well, I was here visiting a friend and I saw Michelle, and she told me she had no one to drive her home, her brother couldn't do it, so I volunteered.",
        "Danny: Oh. Well, thanks, but you don't have to. I'm here. I'll take her.",
        "Michelle: What are you guys whispering about?",
        "Danny: Hm? Your travel plans. Are you sure you're feeling okay enough to leave?",
        "Michelle: I want out.",
        "Danny: Okay, all right. So Robbie and I will take you home. Sound good?",
        "Robbie: Yes!",
        "Danny: All right.",
        "Edmund: That's something I think is going to have to be cleared with the on- duty nurse.",
        "Danny: You haven't cleared it already? All right, okay, I'll do it, I'll do it. I'll be right back. Robbie, stay with Mommy, okay? I'll be right back.",
        "Edmund: Well, I'm afraid I ought to go myself.",
        "Michelle: Well, I'm really glad that you came by.",
        "Edmund: Michelle, about this urge you have to sing my praises, I... just reconsider. It's the kind of thing that can be misinterpreted.",
        "Michelle: By who?",
        "Edmund: Well, Cassie, for one. I want her back in my life, if she'll have me, and you talking about me and having stayed at my place, it's the kind of thing she might see as romantic.",
        "Michelle: Okay. Have it your way. I'll keep what you did between us.",
        "Edmund: Thank you. Thanks. Bye. That's where it will stay forever because it must.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Okay, this is going to be tougher than I thought.",
        "Stephanie: What?",
        "Josh: Stephanie, I meant what I said before. I am still a married man. I have a wife that I love. I'm a very married man. So I'm afraid I'm going to have to turn down your offer.",
        "Stephanie: ( Laughs )",
        "Josh: But it was an excellent offer, so thank you. I appreciate it.",
        "Stephanie: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: You okay?",
        "Reva: You know what? Let's just get out of here, shall we? Damn, too late. Now we have to go over and say hi.",
        "Billy: Hey, we're just... let me hold you up and...",
        "Reva: Okay.",
        "Billy: We'll look like two old buddies going out for a little thing. ( Laughter )",
        "Reva: This is a surprise. Hi, Stephanie.",
        "Stephanie: Hi, how are you doing?",
        "Josh: Hi, there. I was...",
        "Billy: No, no, no, no, no, no. We can't stay. We're... we're...",
        "Reva: On our way to Towers.",
        "Billy: Yes.",
        "Reva: To have lunch.",
        "Billy: That's it.",
        "Reva: Billy actually has a friend that he wants to introduce to me.",
        "Josh: I see.",
        "Billy: ( Laughs )",
        "Josh: Look, I would feel better if I could just tell you what was going on here just now.",
        "Reva: I've got a pretty good idea.",
        "Josh: I don't think you do.",
        "Reva: Oh, come on, Joshua, we're grownups. You don't have to run to me with every little thing you do. You have your fun and I'll have mine.",
        "Josh: Okay. Well, you don't want to keep Billy's friend waiting.",
        "Billy: No, no. Oh, well, we'd better get a move on. Okay.",
        "Reva: See you.",
        "Billy: See you.",
        "Stephanie: So, what was that you were telling me about being married?",
        "Billy: Whoa. Just a little bit further.",
        "Reva: You know, I almost went down in there.",
        "Billy: I know. That would have been better than telling a lie. I have a friend at Towers?",
        "Reva: What was I supposed to say, Billy? There he is, sitting there with that gorgeous girl who, by the way, was the one who fired me. I felt like such a dope. I couldn't think of anything to say.",
        "Billy: Well, you know, you acted like a dope.",
        "Reva: You're so comforting, thank you.",
        "Billy: Okay. I think we should go. What do you think?",
        "Reva: No. I need to sit here for a couple of minutes, or hours.",
        "Billy: Okay, well at least Josh didn't see you in all that pain. It could have been worse.",
        "Reva: A house could have fallen on my head.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Look, all I'm saying is that you can trust, all right? You are with me now.",
        "Lizzie: So, does that mean that you trust me?",
        "Coop: I trust what we have. But Lizzie, this is not just a one-way street. You and I are in this together and you have got to start telling it to me straight.",
        "Lizzie: So then teach me how to trust and be open and honest.",
        "Coop: All right, I'll try.",
        "Lizzie: Thank you. Oh, this is going to be great.",
        "Coop: Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. But listen, I am warning you. If you ever pull a stunt like this little marriage thing again, the deal's off and I am gone. All right? You got it?",
        "Lizzie: Okay.",
        "Coop: All right. ( Cell phone ringing )",
        "Lizzie: I'll let it go to voice mail.",
        "Coop: No. No, no, no, no. You need to get that because it might be Harley and she might have some news to tell us.",
        "Lizzie: Hello? When? Okay. Thank you very much.",
        "Coop: Who was that?",
        "Lizzie: It was just someone.",
        "Coop: No, no, no. Yeah, of course it was someone. Who?",
        "Lizzie: It was one of the guards at the sanitarium. Granddad's at Cedars.",
        "Coop: Why? What happened?",
        "Lizzie: I don't know, but when I get there, he's going to have to see the doctors all over again.",
        "Coop: No, Lizzie, wait a minute, wait a minute. That would make this whole situation worse.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, well I hope it does.",
        "Coop: Lizzie. Lizzie. Why does she never listen to me? Lizzie! Can you slow down for one second?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Well, she's en route to Springfield right now and she'll be back in time for the board meeting. What I want you to do is to ensure that all of our votes are in place and get back to me. Elizabeth.",
        "Lizzie: So I hear you had some mystery ailment.",
        "Alan: Yes, well it comes and goes, Sweetheart.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, well, I'll let them know how sick you are, Grand-Step-Daddy.",
        "Alan: Look, I know that you and I have some matters that we need to discuss, but I want to tell you right now, it is so wonderful to see your beautiful face.",
        "Lizzie: So, you're in pain, huh?",
        "Alan: Yes, and I want to tell you they've treated me abysmally here.",
        "Lizzie: I wonder why.",
        "Coop: Mr. Spaulding.",
        "Lizzie: Gee, now you really look sick.",
        "Alan: Two visitors for the price of one. Lucky me.",
        "Lizzie: We're not visitors. We just came for some answers.",
        "Alan: I will be happy to discuss anything with you, Sweetheart, but I'm feeling rather low at the moment.",
        "Coop: Okay. All right, you know what? She'll come back later, then.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, no. You're definitely low. Who did you send after Coop and why?",
        "Alan: Now, if someone has gone after Mr. Bradshaw, just let me know what happened and I'll get my people on it.",
        "Lizzie: You already got your people on it and they dropped about a hundred tires on Coop's head.",
        "Alan: I'm sorry if he was in an accident, but I had nothing to do with it.",
        "Lizzie: You can quit denying it. I know you're lying. You do this thing with your eyebrow.",
        "Coop: Okay, all right. Come on, chill.",
        "Lizzie: You know who taught me to look out for that? Daddy. And that's just one of the things he taught me, and warned me about.",
        "Alan: Did he also warn you about letting your imagination run wild? I have not gone after Mr. Bradshaw.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, come on. Do you see this? I want you to take a look at this. Do you see how close Coop and I are together? Well, that's how it's going to be from now on.",
        "Alan: Really?",
        "Lizzie: Yes, and there's not a thing you can do to keep us apart. Do you hear me? I finally found someone worth fighting for. Okay, now we can go.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, wait.",
        "Lizzie: Why?",
        "Alan: I need you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Well, what do you say we give it another try?",
        "Reva: I just kind of feel like my back's in a vice. ( Laughs ) Oh, Billy. ( Laughter ) He's such an old goat.",
        "Josh: I thought you were going to Towers?",
        "Billy: We are.",
        "Reva: I'm not.",
        "Billy: She...",
        "Reva: I'm not.",
        "Billy: No?",
        "Reva: Tell the guy that, you know, I'll take a rain check on that lunch. I just... I don't feel like meeting anyone new today.",
        "Billy: What, do you think maybe I should stay with you?",
        "Reva: No, no, and make the guy think that we're both standing him up? Go. He's waiting. Go.",
        "Billy: All right, I'll tell you what, I'll call you later.",
        "Reva: Okay.",
        "Billy: You, too.",
        "Reva: Bye-bye.",
        "Billy: Bye.",
        "Josh: You know, inside, earlier, you seemed pretty excited about meeting this friend of Billy's.",
        "Reva: Well, I changed my mind.",
        "Josh: I'm just surprised, I guess.",
        "Reva: I'm full of surprises. It's part of my charm.",
        "Josh: Yes, it is. Listen, what was going on in there earlier, with Stephanie...",
        "Reva: No explanation needed.",
        "Josh: I just feel that...",
        "Reva: No. Joshua, I know perfectly well what was going on. What, do I look like an idiot? And I'm cool with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Why don't you tell Mommy what's new around here. It's been a while since she's been to the house.",
        "Robbie: Mommy, look. Jude got a new swing set.",
        "Michelle: Oh, wow. What happened to the little pine tree that was there?",
        "Robbie: It died, so uncle Rick cut it down.",
        "Michelle: Hm. A lot of changes, huh? Well, it's one terrific swing set. I hope Jude lets you use it.",
        "Robbie: He does. And look, that wall got painted.",
        "Michelle: And it really needed it.",
        "Robbie: Want to see the new flowerpots?",
        "Michelle: Sure.",
        "Danny: Bud, hey. How about you go inside and wash up and then we're going to have our little snack.",
        "Robbie: Okay.",
        "Danny: Sound good? All right, go ahead. You okay?",
        "Michelle: Thanks, yeah. I'm just...",
        "Danny: Maybe this was a mistake, coming home from the hospital so soon?",
        "Michelle: No, no. No, I'm really glad I'm here.",
        "Danny: You are?",
        "Michelle: Yeah. It's like they say, there's no place like home.",
        "Danny: Is there something that I can do?",
        "Michelle: You brought me home and that is a lot, believe me. And it is, it's really wonderful being here. That's not really what's getting to me.",
        "Danny: Then what? What is it?",
        "Michelle: Edmund's visit. Not that it wasn't great for him to stop by.",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Michelle: Just kind of like an elephant in the room, you know. Edmund and Cassie got a baby and mine died. On the same night. I just can't stop thinking about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Hey, Jerry, any messages? Thank you.",
        "Marina: Hey, Edmund. Could I talk to you for a minute?",
        "Edmund: Actually, I'm pretty busy right now. I have a few calls to make, so excuse me.",
        "Marina: No, I understand. It won't take me long. I just have a quick question.",
        "Edmund: All right.",
        "Marina: Okay. The other night, when you came to the Beacon to ask Danny about the townhouses on Fifth Street.",
        "Edmund: The what? Oh, right. What about them?",
        "Marina: Well, that was the same night Dinah had her baby.",
        "Edmund: Yeah, so?",
        "Marina: So, something about it just doesn't make sense. I mean, at least to me. I was thinking maybe you could help me clear it up.",
        "Edmund: You keep on saying \"it,\" Marina, but I don't know what the \"it\" is you're talking about.",
        "Marina: I'm talking about Michelle.",

        "Josh: The woman works for me. Reva.",
        "Reva: I'm not critIsizing you, I'm not. It's fine. Really. I'm fine.",
        "Josh: Haven't seen Stephanie or anything.",
        "Reva: No, no, I know I'm probably giving you that feeling, but it's not, that's an exaggeration, looked more like a first date, and why not, because Stephanie is, she's a gorgeous woman and she's sharp. A little young. But, hey, then you're young at heart, you know.",
        "Josh: Yeah, maybe I am, because I actually kind of like her. And you're right, that was sort of like a first date. But since I don't have to check in with you or let you know what's going on or anything like that, I guess I don't have to tell you about when or if we might have a second date. Right? See you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: You know about the board meeting this afternoon.",
        "Lizzie: Yes.",
        "Alan: I assume that you will be attending. Elizabeth, it's very important that you are there because the future of the family's company is riding on this.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, so you don't need me, you just need my vote, right?",
        "Alan: Don't do it because of me. Do it because of your father, it's what he would want. Think about your father.",
        "Lizzie: Daddy is dead thanks to you, so don't even do that.",
        "Alan: Gus is not capable of being the head of this company.",
        "Lizzie: Why, because Daddy wouldn't approve?",
        "Alan: Your daddy never would approve. There's only one person that can lead this company and that person is your mother.",
        "Lizzie: Mom? Running Spaulding, you've got to be kidding.",
        "Alan: She is the perfect choice.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, to hand the company right back to you.",
        "Alan: She's on the Spaulding jet returning as we speak.",
        "Lizzie: Just in time for board meeting, what a coincidence.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, all of the votes are in place. Your vote would ensure that your mother is elected. And it would also soften her objection over your relationship with Mr. --",
        "Coop: That's real nice, blackmail.",
        "Lizzie: I think we should leave Mr. Spaulding alone. He's sick. Excuse me. Hi, I'm Lizzie Spaulding, I understand my granddad has been having a lot of pain and nobody seems to know where it's coming from. I love him a lot, I'd really appreciate if you could run every test available to fine out what's wrong with him.",
        "Coop: Lizzie. What are you doing? Every test available, that could take days before he gets out of here.",
        "Lizzie: Wouldn't that be horrible.",
        "Coop: Now what.",
        "Lizzie: Watch and learn, Henry. Captain? Oh, this is Lizzie, I need to speak to Captain Baker please. Yes, Hi. I'm so happy to patch me through. I've got a problem. My grandfather was rushed to the hospital and he's taken a turn for the worse. Now they're taking him to a clinic in Boston. Right. So you have to turn the plane around to get my mom there as fast as possible, but I don't want her to be worried. Great. And that was good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Let me lay it out for you, all right. You come to the Beacon to the suite looking for him, right?",
        "Edmund: Yeah. I was a nervous wreck waiting for my baby to be born. I think I told you that. Counting down the minute to becoming a father for the first time isn't enough to drive someone crazy?",
        "Marina: I don't think so. See that's where Michelle comes in.",
        "Edmund: How?",
        "Marina: I just can't help wondering if maybe you saw her before that night.",
        "Edmund: Why?",
        "Marina: Because Rick and Michelle asked him not to tell anyone that -- so I figured the same thing happened to you...",
        "Edmund: Marina, I realize you're interested in becoming a top flight police officer, you're way off base on all of this. Now, if you're really interested in honing your sleuthing skills, I'd worry less about whom Michelle may have been speaking to and more about where Danny is when he's not with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: A lot of things... (Whispering)",
        "Danny: There are so many people here who love you and who want to help you through this.",
        "Michelle: It makes me more sure of what I should do. Help my dad, work with him.",
        "Danny: Michelle.",
        "Michelle: Danny, I can't stay here, I can't. I have to put some distance between me and...",
        "Danny: Robbie needs you. I need you."
