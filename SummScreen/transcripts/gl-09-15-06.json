        "Lizzie: Jonathan, slow down! Pregnant chick waddling here. ",
        "Jonathan: The movie starts in like two minutes. ",
        "Lizzie: Okay. ",
        "Jonathan: Oh... um, I'm sorry. It\u2019s... it's my bad. I just want to make sure \r\nthat we can sit in the back row together. ",
        "Lizzie: Oh. Well, that's okay. I love it when you apologize. ",
        "Jonathan: Mm-hmm. We have company, Alan\u2019s watchdog shrink. ",
        "Lizzie: Dr. Baker? Where? ",
        "Jonathan: Uh-huh, over by the news stand. Don't look! Just play it cool. ",
        "Lizzie: Okay. Well, why do that when we can give him a show? Come here, \r\nsweetie. Did you see the look on that guy's face? It was priceless. ( Laughs ) ( \r\nmovie music playing ) ( sighs ) Oh, I'm so excited you wanted to see this with \r\nme. I've been dying to see this for weeks. ",
        "Jonathan: Okay, um, I'll catch you after the show. ",
        "Lizzie: What? Why? Where are you going? ",
        "Jonathan: I got a hot date in a dark room with a beautiful blond. ",
        "Lizzie: Tammy's here? ",
        "Jonathan: We can't be seen in public together because Alan\u2019s goon's following \r\nus, so, thanks to Mel\u2019s court order, he can't be in the same room as us. So if \r\nTammy happens to be in the same place as I am at the same time... you know? I'll \r\ncatch you later. Excuse me. Is that seat taken? ",
        "Ashlee: Lizzie! Hi. How lucky is this? I hate watching movies alone. So is \r\nyour better half here? ",
        "",
        "Jonathan: You okay? Look, I'm sorry that I didn't come by last night. I \r\ndidn't know they were going to put a security camera in your hallway right in \r\nfront of your room. ",
        "Tammy: Shh. I'm trying to watch a movie here. ",
        "",
        "Cassie: ( Sighs ) ",
        "Josh: And then think about this from time to time. Just think about the fact \r\nthat at this time tomorrow I will be a free man, okay? ( Phone ringing ) ",
        "Cassie: Marah? Hi, Marah. How are you? What a surprise. I'm fine. I'm just a \r\nlittle busy at the... uh-huh. Okay, what exactly do you want to know about your \r\nfolks? ",
        "",
        "Reva: Hi. ",
        "Billy: What's that, an early letter to Santa? ",
        "Reva: Actually, that's not a bad idea. No, it's a letter I'm writing to \r\nMarah. A letter instead of an e-mail. Does that date me? ",
        "Billy: No. Not at all. Actually, here's some water. I'd like you to take your \r\nrest now. ",
        "Reva: You know something? I will be able to get plenty of rest once I... ",
        "Billy: Yeah, okay. ",
        "Reva: ...Well, you know. ",
        "Billy: Pills? ",
        "Reva: Yes, doctor, yes. ",
        "Billy: Um, Reva, you know... what we were talking about yesterday? ",
        "Reva: What? You want to take it all back? ",
        "Billy: No, no, I... no. Do you know how special you are? I mean, you really \r\ndeserve something very special, and I just want you to know that the way I feel \r\nabout you, I can make it very special for you. ",
        "Reva: I know. Billy? ",
        "Billy: Mm? ",
        "Reva: Everybody needs someone like you. And that's why Josh needs Cassie. ",
        "Billy: Okay. Is this your last big project, getting them together? ",
        "Reva: Yeah, the best and most painful thing I've ever had to do. Only God \r\nknows how long I'm going to have to get that job done. ( Knock on door ) ",
        "Billy: Hey. ",
        "Josh: I assume Reva\u2019s here. ",
        "Reva: Hey, Joshua. ",
        "Billy: Yeah, Josh, this is not really a great time. ",
        "Josh: Yeah, well, it never is a good time to sign divorce papers, I guess, is \r\nit? ",
        "",
        "Ashlee: Is that Tammy and Jonathan? ",
        "Lizzie: Shh. ",
        "Ashlee: It is, and they're totally making out. ",
        "Lizzie: I'm trying to watch the movie. ",
        "Ashlee: Look, that is your husband down there, and he has his hand and his \r\ntongue all... ",
        "Lizzie: He is consoling Tammy. That's it. ",
        "Ashlee: Consoling her? About what? ",
        "Lizzie: Losing him to me. They used to be engaged. ",
        "Ashlee: Yeah. It looks like a really messy breakup. ",
        "Lizzie: Well, I'm the one wearing the ring, aren't I? ",
        "Ashlee: Jonathan only married you for the sake of the baby. ",
        "Lizzie: That's not true. ",
        "Ashlee: Oh, come on. We're up here chatting it up, and they're down there \r\nplaying tonsil hockey, and I can't even see his hands. ",
        "Lizzie: Will you just stop talking? ",
        "Ashlee: What do you think will happen once the baby is born, Lizzie? Don't \r\nyou think Jonathan might ditch you and go back to Tammy? ",
        "Lizzie: Ashlee, shut up! ",
        "Movie patrons: Shh. ",
        "",
        "Reva: Billy? ",
        "Billy: Yeah. If you need me, I'm close by. ",
        "Reva: I had no idea you were working on this. ",
        "Josh: I wasn\u2019t. Actually you were the one that gave me the idea that it was \r\ntime. You said... you said it's a good thing to move on, you know, that it's a \r\nhealthy thing to do, that a person should know when it's time to let go and all \r\nthat, so I... I figured it was time to make it official. The legalese was still \r\nin place from our near miss a couple months ago. Really all that's needed is for \r\nus to sign. ",
        "Reva: We tore up papers like that not too long ago. ",
        "Josh: Yeah, but the time that we spent together on top of the lighthouse sort \r\nof seems like a dream now. ",
        "Reva: Yeah. ",
        "Josh: But it wasn\u2019t. It was real. And so are these. I think it's just time, \r\nyou know, to let go of all the questions because there really aren't going to be \r\nany answers, at least none that make sense so everything has been reduced to \r\nblack and white with a little bit of space left at the bottom for us to sign. My \r\nsignature is already there.",
        "Reva: Joshua, I\u2026",
        "Josh: Reva, you\u2019ve already moved on. You have a new address with Billy. ",
        "Reva: Yeah, it was right for you to have those papers drawn up again, because \r\nit will be easier for everyone concerned once we are clearly and legally\u2026",
        "Josh: Divorced. The word is divorced. No more ambiguity, no more wondering \r\nwhat to say to friends when they ask. And I guess it\u2019ll be easier to tell the \r\nkids once the paperwork is signed, so. ",
        "Reva: Tell the kids?",
        "Josh: Yes, I mean we have to let them know that it\u2019s permanent, right? I\u2019ll \r\nlet you tell them about you and uncle Billy.",
        "Reva: Oh goody. And you can tell them about you and aunt Cassie. It is \r\ncertainly a lot for them to take in.",
        "Josh: That\u2019s life, I guess. ",
        "Reva: Yeah. That\u2019s life.",
        "Josh: I\u2019m sure the kids will understand in time. We had something once, and \r\nwe don't anymore. It's that simple. ",
        "Reva: Well, I wouldn't put it that way. ",
        "Josh: Well, ultimately I don't know that it matters how we put it. Done is \r\ndone. So I'm going to leave these here for you to sign, and I'll come back later \r\nto pick them up. You might want to think about calling your lawyer. We just have \r\nto make sure that nothing financial has changed, and that will be that. I'll see \r\nyou. ",
        "Reva: Bye, Joshua. ",

        "Cassie: Your mother\u2019s a shrink. Ask her how to tell her favorite niece that \r\nher parents are getting divorced again and they just haven\u2019t gotten around to \r\ntelling her about it. ",
        "Mel: Did you? ",
        "Cassie: Me? Tell Marah, no, I mean I wanted to. I hate to keep something so \r\nimportant from her, but I just don't think it's really my place. ",
        "Mel: Well, maybe not, but you are involved. ",
        "Cassie: Is that your polite way of saying that I'm why the situation is so \r\nmessy? ",
        "Mel: Cassie, relax. I'm not judging you. ",
        "Cassie: Hey, sorry. I'm just a little defensive on the subject these days.\r\n",
        "Mel: Please, whatever you have between you and Josh is none of my business. I \r\ngot my own problems. ",
        "Cassie: Really? Anything you care to share? ",
