I'm checking in, seeing how you're doing.", "Michelle: I'm working. I'm at the lighthouse. I've been working all day. I've been finding all these cool little things that people have left behind. You know, you can drop by later if you want to give me a hand, if you've got nothing better to do.", "Tony: I probably have something better to do, yeah.", "Michelle: Really? Better than seeing me? (Motorcycle engine rumbling)", "Tony: You know what? I've got to go. I will talk to you later. My man. How are you doing? You came. Good to see you. All right, here you go. It's all there.", "Guy: Thanks.", "Tony: Beautiful.", "Guy: You're going to love her. She's beautiful.", "Tony: Yes, she is. I'm buying it for someone else, not me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: Hey, beautiful. Hope you're hungry.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: I wasn't sure you were going to show up.", "Jb: What's up?", "Lizzie: Well, it's about tammy. Are you still interested?", "Jb: She's hot enough. Why? I thought she was with the guy you wanted.", "Lizzie: Well, unfortunately, yes, but I think there's a way we can both get what we want.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Joey: I'm done with my manual labor for today. Now it's off to my serious job.", "Tammy: You know, you really didn't have to come all the way out here. My mom would have understood.", "Joey: Yeah, well, I like working here. And I like being with you. It's not so complicated.", "Tammy: Because there's no lizzie around?", "Joey: I suppose.", "Tammy: She's the only distraction I can think of at spaulding. So, why don't you just ignore her? I mean, how hard can it be?", "Lizzie: (Laughs) hey there, sleepyhead. Joey, you were amazing last night.", "Tammy: So, we're meeting up at company later, right? After you go into the office and help remy and marina with the voter registration drive?", "Joey: Yeah, sure.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Tammy, I didn't know you were here. Hi, joey.", "Tammy: We're just on our way out, actually.", "Edmund: Well, not on my account, I hope.", "Tammy: Of course not. Mom's out, so you have the whole place to yourself. Make yourself useful.", "Edmund: I will do my best. They're gone.", "Man: I came as quickly as i could.", "Edmund: And you'll be gone just as fast. You know what I need? Recognize her?", "Man: She's been in the news.", "Edmund: And I'm not happy about that. And something has to be done about that, and it has to be done today.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: Are you following me?", "Cassie: Get over yourself.", "Jeffrey: Well, what's up, mrs. Winslow?", "Cassie: When you left the farm, I told myself I was going to let you handle this. But I can't stay away.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: You're putting me in here now? This is a travesty, a miscarriage of justice! I've done nothing.", "Cop: Except harassing phillip spaulding.", "Reva: I didn't get my phone call, either. Somebody's going to hear about that.", "Dinah: You're just in time. The food is not so bad, if you hold your nose.", "Reva: Well, I don't mean to be rude, but I ain't staying.", "Dinah: You never know.", "Reva: Dinah.", "Dinah: Hey, girl. I've got the top bunk.", "Reva: Someone is going to be so sorry they put me in here with you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: Here she comes, little miss dependable. Okay, so we're good, right? Um, make it look realistic.", "Jb: How real do you want it?", "Lizzie: That was good.", "Jb: I know.", "Lizzie: Okay, I'll be right back. I'll definitely be right back.", "Jb: Oh, you know I'll be waiting.", "Lizzie: Okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jb: Hey.", "Tammy: Do I know you?", "Jb: Not yet.", "Tammy: I'm waiting for some friends.", "Jb: You're a friend of lizzie's, right? Tina?", "Tammy: Tammy. And actually, calling lizzie my friend would pretty much be pushing it. We just... we know each other, that's all.", "Jb: I guess lizzie's not too fat in the friend department.", "Tammy: I'm sorry, who are you?", "Jb: Lizzie and I are... well, I guess we're friends.", "Tammy: Yeah. Oh, I saw what kind of friends you are.", "Jb: (Laughs) yeah, I guess you did.", "Tammy: Is there something i can do for you?", "Jb: I just saw you sitting over here. I don't know, I had to see what you were like.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Guy: At 115 she corners like she's on rails.", "Tony: I like to hear it, i do. She won't be seeing much over the speed limit, though, but that's all right.", "Bill: All right, all right. Not a problem. I'll be over there to take care of it. All right, thanks a lot. You buying a new bike? Nice.", "Guy: Well, whoever he's buying it for is one very lucky lady.", "Tony: My man, thank you. Take care, all right?", "Bill: You're buying that for A... (clears throat)", "Tony: A friend.", "Bill: 650. Sweet, sweet, sweet. Not too fast, not too slow. It's perfect for A... a beginner.", "Tony: What are you trying to say?", "Bill: You didn't buy this for michelle, did you?", "Tony: (Sighs)", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: You love to feed me.", "Danny: You love to eat.", "Michelle: Yeah, I do. I love to eat.", "Danny: So, this place is looking really good. It's really coming along nicely.", "Michelle: Thanks. Thanks. I've got a lot more ideas that i haven't started on yet.", "Danny: It's going to be a lot of work.", "Michelle: Well, I'm motivated.", "Danny: I can see that. You know, I can help.", "Michelle: Yeah, I know. I know. You really want to help. But if it's all the same to you...", "Danny: Well, okay, all right. No pressure. I'm not pushing.", "Michelle: Yeah, you are.", "Danny: No, I'm not.", "Michelle: Yeah, you are. That's how you do it: A little word there, a mention here. It's not really a shove, it's just like a little nudge.", "Danny: Oh, you've noticed that about me. Pretty good.", "Michelle: Yeah, it's not that hard to figure out.", "Danny: Uh-huh.", "Michelle: The whole permit thing was one thing...", "Danny: But that's as far as it goes. Got it.", "Michelle: It's, you know, it's not really a \"danny and michelle\" thing.", "Danny: Yeah, okay. Okay, all right.", "Michelle: It's my project.", "Danny: Yeah, okay. I'm not crowding you.", "Michelle: So, is that what all this food is? Are you going to try to work me?", "Danny: (Laughs) no, michelle. I'm trying to feed you. I thought we could, you know, take this time to catch up, talk, talk about robbie. Whatever.", "Michelle: (Laughs) yeah, nothing is ever \"whatever\" with you.", "Danny: That's true. You got me.", "Michelle: Yeah, so cut it out.", "Danny: What?", "Michelle: Stop trying.", "Danny: Stop trying what? To find ways to get closer to you? I'm never going to stop doing that.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: All right, are you sure you want to do that, mrs. Winslow? I don't know, I don't think it's a good idea.", "Cassie: Well, I don't care. You owe me.", "Jeffrey: I owe you? What? For saving your life on three occasions?", "Cassie: (Laughs)", "Jeffrey: You don't even give me so much as a discount on my room, and do I complain? No.", "Cassie: You lost points in D.C.", "Jeffrey: Oh, come on. We're not going to dwell on that, are we?", "Cassie: You gave me the run- around. A con job, is more like it. You tried to pass off some woman as the identity thief.", "Jeffrey: I thought i explained that. You know, I can explain it if you listen to me.", "Cassie: When it comes to my life, when it comes to my kids' lives, you don't get to make choices, okay? And you're the one that told me I need to figure out what i wanted to do about dinah. So?", "Jeffrey: All right. Well, when this decision that you've made goes south, I'm going to have to jump in and save your life yet again.", "Cassie: If things go badly it won't be my life that needs saving.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: I trust I've made myself clear. It's top priority, it has to happen today.", "Man: You've had a lot of trouble recently.", "Edmund: I'm counting on you to do your job so all of that trouble disappears.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: You know what I'm capable of.", "Dinah: Yes, I do. And you know who I am, of course. So, all intros aside, what are you doing here?", "Reva: Assault, maybe? Battery.", "Dinah: Oh, okay. So, maybe a little cat-fight in the jail cell? Should I call the guards over?", "Reva: I was interrupted while giving phillip spaulding a piece of my mind, so I have a lot of pent-up frustration that I would love to work out.", "Dinah: With me as your punching bag? Well, I'd ask you if I could fix my make- up, but okay. Go for it. Give me your best shot.", "Reva: That doesn't sound like the dinah I know. Shrinking violet?", "Dinah: Well, the last time you saw me, I wasn't a fugitive for years. I mean, that tends to work on your stamina a bit. I've had plenty of time to think about the mistakes I've made, reva.", "Reva: And you've discovered the error of your ways? Is that the angle, dinah? I talked to cassie. She told me how sorry you are.", "Dinah: I am. I am. I have made some horrible mistakes, reva, and they're catching up to me. I know that my only chance to have any kind of life hinges on me making some serious life changes. If I don't, I'm doomed. And I really do want to make this up to cassie, any way i can-- to her family, to all of you, I want to do it for all of them, for myself, and especially because it's what hart would have wanted. And you don't believe a word I'm saying.", "Reva: I know you, dinah. You're poison. You're here to get back at cassie and her entire family.", "Dinah: And I have to go through you first, is that it?", "Reva: You can try. But I guarantee it will be the last thing you ever do.", "Dinah: No offense, reva, but what could you possibly do to me that has not already been done?", "Reva: Well, you see, the last time you were here, I didn't do enough to protect my sister.", "Dinah: So, what are you going to do now? Are you going to suffocate me with a pillow? Are you going to, like, call the guard, put some glass in my food? Is that who you are now?", "Reva: Things have changed, dinah. My kids are out of the country, josh is busy trying to hang on to a place that means more to us than anywhere else in this world. So, you caught me at a bad time. You hurt my sister and I will hurt you.", "Cop: Come with me.", "Reva: Wait a minute! That... what is this? Oh, that makes total sense. You take her and you leave me in here. Do you know what she's done?", "Cop: Back away from the gate.", "Reva: (Frustrated sigh)", "Dinah: Look, you should be glad I'M... you know, you should be glad that I'm back. Your family, I know they've been sort of leaving you alone lately, flying the coop. But now you can put all your energy into keeping big, bad dinah away from your little sister.", "Reva: Hey! What is it with you? (Laughs)", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: So I found this in one of the rooms downstairs. It had, like, a bunch of... i don't even know, a bunch of whale's teeth or something.", "Danny: (Laughs) whale teeth?", "Michelle: What's so funny?", "Danny: Well, michelle, I know this is a lighthouse, but do you know how far we are from the ocean? Any ocean?", "Michelle: Well, I don't care. Maybe whoever worked here before was from maine or something.", "Danny: That's true.", "Michelle: There's a lot of cool things here. Look, there's all these little coins and things. Look at these. They could be valuable, right?", "Danny: I don't know. I don't really know much about coins.", "Michelle: Well...", "Danny: So, what else did you find?", "Michelle: I bet they're lucky.", "Danny: What else?", "Michelle: There's a lot of things. There's like a lot of really cool things. This whole place is like different pieces of a puzzle.", "Danny: And how do you think they all add up? You figure that out yet?", "Michelle: Nope. But I'm going to find out.", "Danny: And you haven't had any more trouble, like that run- in you had with that guy outside our house the other day?", "Michelle: Nope, oh great protector. I hate to disappoint you, not one little bit.", "Danny: No. That's not... that's good. You know, I could call some guys I know, and you wouldn't have to know they were around, but it would just be good for a little added...", "Michelle: Protection?", "Danny: Yeah. One look at these guys and anybody would think twice before messing with you.", "Michelle: Thank you for not calling them. Thank you.", "Danny: It took a lot of willpower.", "Michelle: I know. I know. Thank you for resisting that. It shows me that you actually are trying to get to know me.", "Danny: I'm actually starting to like the trying.", "Michelle: So, what do we got over here?", "Danny: Oh, all kinds of good stuff.", "Michelle: Look at this. Trying to get me drunk and take advantage of me?", "Danny: What? You mean I have to get you drunk to get lucky?", "Michelle: Nope.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: You know, I overheard rick talking about you and michelle, but I didn't buy any of it.", "Tony: Well, good for you.", "Bill: Tony, is this serious? Do you really think that you and...", "Tony: Ah.", "Bill: What?", "Tony: I see. You didn't like it when michelle was with danny, and... I mean, I just thought it was about danny, but I guess maybe it's about a santos. Or... or anyone in general. Am I right?", "Bill: No, you're ridiculous. No, I'm just trying to protect my friend while she's trying to remember what's what.", "Tony: Well, hey, I think she's doing just fine on her own.", "Bill: Do you?", "Tony: Yeah, I do.", "Bill: And you think this helps the situation? You and danny fighting over her?", "Tony: (Laughs)", "Bill: Huh?", "Tony: You need to calm down and just let it go. Relax.", "Bill: No, it's all right you're getting a kick out of it, but I mean, you know how this is going to end, right?", "Tony: No, not really. I don'T.", "Bill: You don't?", "Tony: Uh-uh. Not yet.", "Bill: Well, let me... I'll let you in on it.", "Tony: Okay, you do that.", "Bill: She's going to end up with him. That's the way it works. Danny and michelle. Nothing's going to change it.", "Tony: Hm. Well, we will see about that, won't we?", "Bill: Oh, man. Why am I wasting my time with you?", "Tony: Good point. Good point. I will... nice talking to you.", "Bill: Yeah.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: So, you're with lizzie now? Since when?", "Jb: Couple days. We're just getting started. You know how it is. I'm just sorry I didn't meet you first.", "Tammy: Well, you didn'T. And I'm taken, so you might want to stop flirting now.", "Jb: No. Not really.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dinah: What's going on here? Coming up, on \"guiding light.\"", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: Delicious. You ready to try some?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: I'm ready to try something.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: I saw dinah before she showed up at cassie's place. She stayed with me a day or two, and then she left.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: The next time dinah is crying on your shoulders, just look out for the knife she's probably stabbing in your back.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dinah: What is your problem?", "Cassie: How can you ask that question with a straight face?", "Dinah: What is this about?", "Cassie: Us.", "Dinah: You know, the amount of time you're spending here, one might think you're the prisoner, instead of me.", "Cassie: I am, dinah. Since you've been back in town, I'm trapped. I can't move forward, I can't go back. I can't do anything until you tell me about the past few years, the years you spent being me.", "Dinah: I was using you to get by.", "Cassie: And that's all it was?", "Dinah: What, you want more? As hard as it is to believe, yes, I was trying to stay out of prison.", "Cassie: So, what did you do, pick my name out of a hat? Because you could have stolen anyone's identity. This has been about me all the way back to when you pulled that trigger and you killed hart. So you tell me everything, or I'll walk out of here and I'll let you fry.", "Dinah: Yoknow, this is a waste of my time, and I know it is...", "Cassie: Tell me.", "Dinah: What? Like you don't already know? I wanted your life, cassie! I wanted all of it. So I took it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: Hey! Nice of you to drop by.", "Bill: You all right?", "Reva: You mean because I'm locked up in here?", "Bill: Well, at least if you're in here, we can keep track of you.", "Reva: (Sarcastic laugh)", "Bill: (Chuckles) for a minute there, I thought i was going to come down and find...", "Reva: What? Me in here with your sister? Is that why you came running down here, because you thought my hands would be around her throat by now?", "Bill: Where is dinah?", "Reva: Uh, she was in here when they brought me in. And then she put on that act, you know, trying to make me think she was a new woman.", "Bill: She's trying.", "Reva: She's something, all right. Anyway, I told her I didn't buy her act and they took her upstairs.", "Bill: So then you didn't, you know...", "Reva: I didn't lay a finger on her, no. So, why are you down here?", "Bill: I came down to bail you out. See? I care. That's right. And I've got good news. Charges against you are dropped, and you're free to go as soon as this cage is unlocked!", "Reva: I am so very grateful. Should I send phillip chocolates or flowers?", "Bill: Yeah, right. Well, listen, you really don't know where dinah is?", "Dinah: They took her to talk to her lawyer. You know, she's trying to weasel out of this thing, not do any time, so she could be back on the streets trying to figure out new ways to terrorize my family.", "Bill: What, are you telling me people can't change? I mean, you've been given more chances than I can count.", "Reva: (Exasperated sigh) oh, bill, do not compare me to dinah. I never set out to hurt anyone.", "Bill: She's not going to hurt anyone, either.", "Reva: Except cassie. Cassie is my sister. She's your family, too.", "Bill: Well, dinah is my sister and she is trying. In fact, that's why she came back to town, because she wants to... what? What? Why are you looking at me like that?", "Reva: How long have you known she was back in town?", "Bill: Does it matter? I just...", "Reva: Yeah. It matters. So the way I'm thinking is you saw her, or she found you, she needed your help, you gave her, what, a place to stay? (Sighs) bill.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cop: You owe your nephew here, mrs. Lewis. He got you out.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: I don't owe him a thing.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: Does lizzie know she's hooked up with a total cheat? Flirting with one of her friends.", "Jb: I thought you said you weren't friends.", "Tammy: I almost feel sorry for lizzie.", "Jb: Lizzie's cool. She knows the deal. We're not exclusive.", "Tammy: Well, I am.", "Jb: Your boyfriend is that guy, joey, right?", "Tammy: Yeah. How did you know that? Lizzie?", "Jb: Look, I'm sorry, I don't mean to make you get all squirmy, but I just figured you'd be into getting to know lizzie's guy since she knows yours so well.", "Tammy: What is that supposed to mean?", "Jb: None of my business.", "Tammy: What's none of your business? You don't know anything.", "Jb: Really? Do you know where your boyfriend was the night of the storm?", "Tammy: He works for spaulding enterprises. He was meeting some execs over at towers. They had a reception for him.", "Jb: Oh, yeah, he was received. But I don't think they were wearing a suit and tie.", "Tammy: What are you talking about?", "Jb: Look, I'm only telling you this because you look like a nice person and you don't deserve to get played. Joey was with lizzie that night. All night.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: You don't like to do anything the simple way, do you?", "Danny: No.", "Michelle: Where's the peanut butter and jelly?", "Danny: Ugh. Come on.", "Michelle: What is that?", "Danny: This? It's pate.", "Michelle: Liver?", "Danny: What? You used to love it.", "Michelle: Oh, here we go.", "Danny: No, stop it. I'm serious. Stop it. You don't have to like it now. I just thought you might...", "Michelle: Another memory trigger thing? Yeah, cut it out.", "Danny: Shh. Just try it. Try it. Try it. Come on.", "Michelle: How many geese-- or ducks, whatever-- were killed for that?", "Danny: Oh, see? I do know you.", "Michelle: What?", "Danny: It's vegetarian. No animals were harmed in the making of this flashback moment.", "Michelle: Tricky.", "Danny: Mm-hmm. Try it.", "Michelle: You first.", "Danny: All right, I'll try it.", "Michelle: Uh, uh, uh...", "Danny: What? (Laughs)", "Michelle: See, that's a little trick of my own. Well?", "Danny: Delicious. You ready to try some?", "Michelle: I'm ready to try something.", "Danny: Does this mean I'm getting lucky?", "Michelle: I don't know. It means you get me some wine, though.", "Danny: Like you need it.", "Michelle: The glasses are in there.", "Danny: All right. I'll be right back.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tony: Hey.", "Michelle: Hey.", "Tony: You busy?", "Michelle: Uh, well...", "Tony: Catch.", "Michelle: What's this?", "Tony: They look like keys to me, don't they?", "Michelle: Yeah, keys to what?", "Tony: I'd say freedom.\u00f1R", "Michelle: Is this your motorcycle key?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: You're wrong. There's no way that joey would be with lizzie. There's no way he could have.", "Jb: Look, I know it hurts to hear. I just wanted you to know.", "Tammy: You're new in town, right? I think you're getting your people mixed up.", "Lizzie: Hey, how are you? Jb, what are you doing here?", "Jb: Just hanging.", "Tammy: And spreading lies.", "Lizzie: Lies about what?", "Tammy: Your new boyfriend here was making up stories about you and joey.", "Lizzie: Me and joey, huh? You told her?", "Jb: I thought you said it was cool.", "Lizzie: It was just a one- time thing. It meant nothing. I told you to forget about that.", "Jb: Yeah, well, you said it was no big deal.", "Lizzie: Yeah, no big deal to me, but not to her.", "Tammy: You are lying again! Now, just tell me the truth, lizzie. Were you with joey?", "Lizzie: Look, tammy, I'm really sorry, okay? I never wanted to tell you this. I never planned on telling you.", "Tammy: No. No, I don't believe you. Joey would never. And if you... you!", "Lizzie: Relax. It's not like I made joey do anything.", "Tammy: No. This can't be happening. Joey loves me. He would never.", "Lizzie: Of course he loves you, tammy. It wasn't about love. It was just about sex. He's still yours.", "Tammy: I hate you!", "Lizzie: You just had to tell her, didn't you?", "Jb: Okay, it was my fault. Whatever. Look, I think it's better that you know, tammy. Trust me. I'm out of here.", "Tammy: I have never hated anything more in my life. And I don't believe you. I won'T. There is no way that joey would ever be with anybody as disgusting and evil as you are.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dinah: I wanted your life, cassie. I don't know if there's any other way to put it. You had something that I dreamt of. You had children and you had love, and despite everything that you went through, you had the genuine \"happily ever after.\" And being on the run, how was i ever going to get any of those things? I figured you just can't wish for those things to happen. You have to go out and earn what you want.", "Cassie: Or steal.", "Dinah: No, you're missing my point. You have to be worthy of anything you get in life. You have to deserve whatever it is you're going after. And I was never going to be that kind of person, so I had to change.", "Cassie: You become someone else. That's called insanity, dinah.", "Dinah: No. No, not if you really look at it. Because, see, people treated me with compassion. They were genuine and they were thoughtful, all because they thought I was you. They were kind to me because they thought I was...", "Cassie: It was a fantasy, dinah. A fantasy. It didn't bother you that people were doing all those things because you lied?", "Dinah: Oh, it bothered me. Yes, that was probably the most awful part, because, you see, there was an empty hole that was inside of me, and that hole was who I really was. Yes, it was driving me crazy pretending to be you. Because every time I did it, i got further and further away from being just me.", "Cassie: Then why not come clean? Why come to my house and manipulate rj into thinking you were his friend?", "Dinah: I care for rj, not just because he's hart's son, but because he's yours. I would never hurt him. I ran into that barn to get him, to save him. My god, cassie, I am different. My life is different. And I know what I did pushed the edge of sanity or reason, but you wanted to know what this was all about and I'm telling you, and you can believe it or not. But I fell into a pit that was deeper than any human will ever go. And I, by god, fought my way back and got my life back. And I am proud of that, even though I am going to spend the rest of my life locked up. I am sorry, cassie.", "Jeffrey: Well, there's no blood on the floor.", "Cassie: Everything's fine. I'm done.", "Jeffrey: What did you say to her?", "Dinah: Just some things that she probably didn't want to hear, but she asked. Look at that, everyone is still breathing and alive. Isn't that great? That should count for something, don't you think?", "Jeffrey: Yeah. Barely.", "Dinah: (Sighs) still alive and ready to move on. I know I am.", "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, unfortunately, the only place you're moving on to is your jail cell.", "Dinah: For now, maybe.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: Hey, tony.", "Tony: Danny. All right, well, this is obviously a bad time.", "Danny: What's up? What have you got there?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: Keys to tony's motorcycle. I think. Oh! I mentioned that I wanted to go up north for some antiques for the restaurant. Is that what you were... is that why you were acting so mysterious on the phone? Were you trying to surprise me, to do it today?", "Tony: Yeah, that's right.", "Michelle: That's so sweet. Come here. Come here.", "Tony: Thank you. Well, today's obviously not a good day for surprises.", "Michelle: Yeah. Danny and I were kind of, you know...", "Tony: I can see that.", "Michelle: Sorry.", "Tony: It's okay, you know? We'll do it another time.", "Michelle: Good.", "Tony: Okay, so I will call you, okay? All right.", "Michelle: Hey?", "Tony: Yeah?", "Michelle: Keys?", "Tony: See you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: So, where were we?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Okay, okay. Listen, I saw dinah before she showed up at cassie's place. She stayed with me a day or two and then she left. At least that's what she told she was going to do.", "Reva: And you believed her.", "Bill: Well, why wouldn't i believe her? And if s4jingered in town, who that doesn't make her public enemy number one.", "Reva: You know what, bill? You can make excuses for her, you can try to sympathize, you can do whatever you want, but i know what dinah's capable of. And it scares me. And if you were at all loyal to your family, it would scare you, too.", "Bill: Wait a minute. I am loyal to my family. I am. And you just can't handle the fact that my family extends beyond you and uncle josh.", "Reva: Oh, because we were the ones that were there for you! The next time dinah is crying on your shoulders, just look out for the knife she's probably stabbing in your back.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Joey: I thought we were going to meet here. What happened to remy and marina? I thought...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: We need to talk.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jb: And now the fireworks.", "Lizzie: Hmm, you got that right.", "Jb: So, are we all going to get what we came for?", "Lizzie: What do you mean?", "Jb: I mean, I did my part. Now you're going to make sure i hook up with tammy.", "Lizzie: Right. About that. I don't think you're exactly tammy's type.", "Jb: Why not?", "Lizzie: Well, maybe it's a hunch. I mean, I do know her. You can give it a shot if you want. I don't think you're going to get very far.", "Jb: You let me worry about how far I'm going to get.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Joey: Hey, what's going on?", "Tammy: I don't know. I trust you. Joey, I know that you would never do anything to hurt me.", "Joey: What's this about?", "Tammy: I need you to be honest with me.", "Joey: Tammy, I don't know.", "Tammy: Tell me about...", "Joey: What?", "Tammy: The night of the storm.", "Joey: Tammy, what did you...", "Tammy: Tell me what happened, joey. What did you do? What did you do?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: Thanks.", "Dinah: Home sweet home, huh? For now.", "Jeffrey: You might have talked a good game with cassie but look where you are, hm? And you're not going anywhere. As a matter of fact, you may never get out of here.", "Dinah: You shouldn't talk like that. I'd like to think of the glass as half- full.", "Jeffrey: If you do manage to somehow con cassie and she helps you out, you better treat her right.", "Dinah: And if I don't?", "Jeffrey: Don't test me.", "Dinah: You like to say things like that, but what exactly do they mean? What is the thing you plan to do to me, in case I cross you?", "Jeffrey: You keep pushing me and you're going to find out what I'm willing to do.", "Dinah: Still so protective of ms. Winslow, hm? Chivalry isn't dead, and neither are your feelings for her.", "Jeffrey: Always got to have the last word. Well, dinah, listen to this. ( Cell door slams shut)", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: Oh, edmund. I'm so glad you're here. I have to talk to you about something.", "Edmund: Cassie, cassie, wait, wait, wait. May I go first?", "Cassie: Is everything okay?", "Edmund: Uh, no. No, everything is not okay, but I think everything is going to be fine in just a few minutes.", "Cassie: Okay, you're scaring me.", "Edmund: Cassie, I don't want to rush this, but I have no idea how not to rush it, so... we have been through... cassie, we are so close to having everything we want. We've confronted so much together: Our past, richard, every awful thing I ever did to you, even the silliness with vinnie salerno.", "Cassie: Oh...", "Edmund: And then this business with dinah came along. And, cassie, I've realized i can't wait for that moment when the skies are clear and the waters are smooth and everything is just perfect, because everything is never going to be just perfect. But I've also realized that my life is never going to be any more perfect than it is right now, simply because you're in it. And I'm sorry it's taken me so long to realize that, and so long to act on it in faith and in trust and love and honor. And will you marry me? Oh, wait, wait, wait. Um... cassie winslow, will you do me the honor of becoming my wife?", "Cassie: Oh! Next, on \"guiding light.\"", "Cassie: But I just can't help thinking that there is no coincidence between what is going on right now and this ring and that dinah is the reason this is all happening.", "Edmund: Dinah has everything to do with it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: I have an amazing connection with tony, but that doesn't mean that I need to get my memory back to know what i feel when I'm with you. It ain't nostalgia."], "Transcript Author": ["by Boo"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTN4-uLEUIA"}
