        "Harley: Then let me be the first to hug the new C.E.O. Of Spaulding Enterprises.",
        "Gus: Well don't hug me too long. I mean nobody's voted yet, so...",
        "Harley: Yeah, but it's between you and the guy in the sanitarium for killing his own son, so I think you got a shot at this.",
        "Gus: Yeah, well see. I don't know.",
        "Blake: You guys are here?",
        "Gus: Yeah, well, I called this shindig.",

I don't know why people like Cassie get what they want in this life and the rest of us suffer. Well, I guess nobody said that this life was going to be easy. Or fair to us. Michelle, to us. We deserve better things. And may things turn around for both of us as soon as possible.",

        "India: I vote to let Harley speak.",
        "Blake: I second that move.",
        "Alexandra: Very well, you have the floor.",
        "Harley: Yes. Gus would not want to you vote without hearing more about what he plans to accomplish here. I mean let's face it. There's nothing exciting happening here. Nothing new. And no offense, but when I think of Spaulding Enterprises I think starchy. I think yesterday's news. We have to redefine ourselves for the generation to come. We have to really look how we portray ourselves in a digital age. I can't believe I actually just said that, but it's true. I mean honestly, when people think Spaulding Enterprises, they think corporate greed. They think old boys' network. They think selfish, nasty people who care about nothing except power and control. There are other things. There's honesty, there's decency. The company will continue to move forward with those things. People will want to be associated with the Spaulding name. They will trust in Spaulding. Take a risk, tell your shareholders that you plan to do the right thing. This company is capable of making a difference in the world in people's lives. And not just ours. But generations to come. Gus thanks you.",
        "Alexandra: Well, thank you, Harley, for that. Now I would like to call a vote.",
        "Harley: Cast my vote for me, please. I've got to find Gus. Oh, good, they're just getting ready to vote.",
        "Gus: Don't worry about it. I don't want it any more.",
        "Harley: You don't want it? Oh, boy.",

        "Edmund: Oh, come on, Dinah. If you stop to think about it, there's a happy ending for everyone. Michelle doesn't have the burden of raising a child on her own without a father. And Cassie and I get to give Hope a wonderful life she deserves.",
        "Dinah: What about my happy ending?",
        "Edmund: Well, almost everyone. Come on, don't think for a minute that I don't appreciate all your hard work. You've been amazing.",
        "Dinah: Damn you! You cannot do this to me! This is it?",
        "Edmund: Dinah?",
        "Dinah: I'm never getting out of here?",
        "Edmund: Please. I have a lot on my mind.",
        "Edmund: I don't care.",
        "Dinah: You know what? Why don't you kill me. Kill me. Hit me over the head. Smother me. It doesn't matter. Put me out of my misery because I swear to you if you don't do it I'm going to!",
        "Edmund: Dinah, no one is going to kill anyone.",
        "Dinah: I can't do this. I can't. I can't.",
        "Edmund: Okay, you're having a panic attack you just need to calm down.",
        "Dinah: Oh! I can't do this! I need help! I need help. I can't do this!",
        "Edmund: All right, I'll help you.",
        "Dinah: I don't have-- listen to me. Only thing that helps me is these. And I need them. They help me with my anxiety and they help me sleep. Could you please refill them?",
        "Edmund: Absolutely not. You just talked about killing yourself.",
        "Dinah: I don't care! You can regulate my dosage! You can keep my pills! I need them!",
        "Edmund: Okay! Anything to get you calmed down.",
        "Dinah: Thank you. Go.",
        "Edmund: Save my wine.",

        "Jeffrey: Oh you like that, huh? Yes. I just love being poked and prodded by Dr. Mel Bauer.",
        "Cassie: Well, you know what? At least now we know you have a sinus infection. It will be gone in a couple of days. What did you want? Did you want nature to take its course?",
        "Jeffrey: I think nature already has taken its course. ( Cell phone rings ) Sorry.",
        "Cassie: You're not supposed to use that in a hospital.",

        "Jeffrey: Okay, well you ladies behave yourselves. You take care of your mommy. Don't let her flirt with the doctors.",

        "Michelle: When did you even have time to...",
        "Danny: This morning. I ordered it. I thought it would be a good idea to plant it and say a few words, that way every spring when it blooms, we'll know that the baby is always here.",
