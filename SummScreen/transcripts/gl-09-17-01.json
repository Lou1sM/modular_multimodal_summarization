        "\r\nDax: I take it everything is well with Cassie? ",
        "\r\nRichard: Well, you know, she's a bit preoccupied right now, that's all-- you \r\nknow, with the children's museum, Tammy going back to school, RJ, all that. ",
        "\r\nThat's where she is now. She's at the children's museum. She assures me that \r\nshe'll be back here in time for the result of the vote. ",
        "\r\nDax: Mm, the vote. It still sounds odd to me. ",
        "\r\nRichard: Yes, well, get used to it, Dax, because from now on, it's the \r\npeople's will that will determine the fate of San Cristobal, not a royal decree. ",
        "\r\nDax: We're another brave experiment in democracy, right? Richard, I \r\nknow you too well. There is something troubling you above and beyond the \r\nJosh Lewis scandal, isn't there?",

        "\r\nSam: Ah, good, honest work, the backbone of America. I'm proud of you, \r\nRomeo. ",
        "\r\nTony: We're not open yet. ",
        "\r\nSam: I know. That's all right. I stopped by to say thank you. ",
        "\r\nTony: For what? ",
        "\r\nSam: For the incredibly astute advice you gave me. ",
        "\r\nRomeo: You want me to get rid of him? ",
        "\r\nTony: No, that's okay. My advice, huh? What, you jumped in a lake? ",
        "\r\nBecause you don't look so wet. ",
        "\r\nSam: (Laughs) very funny, Tony. You kill me. ",
        "\r\nRomeo: Don't I wish. ",
        "\r\nSam: (Clears throat) no. I want you to remember when you told me \r\nMarah was all mine and I better take good care of her. Remember that? I'm \r\ngoing to take great care of her. ",
        "\r\nTony: What the hell are you talking about? ",
        "\r\nSam: The snapshot of Josh Lewis bribing off that bigwig down in San \r\nCristobal. I knew right away it was a setup. ",
        "\r\nTony: Pictures don't lie. ",
        "\r\nSam: Well, they can in the digital age, and that shot of Josh Lewis is as \r\nfake as a four- dollar Bill. ",
        "\r\nTony: What, are you some expert on photography now? ",
        "\r\nSam: No. I just have the proof that it was doctored. And you know what \r\nthat means, right? It means that I get to run to Josh's rescue waving the truth \r\nin \r\nmy hand like a cavalry flag. Now, let's just imagine if you will, shall we, how\r\n\r\nMarah's going to react when I bail out her dad. Grateful? Sure. Relieved? ",
        "\r\nYeah. But that's just the beginning. Hell, I think she may love me for it.",

        "\r\nBuzz: Frank! Frank, slow down! ",
        "\r\nFrank: First you complain that I don't get here soon enough. Then you \r\ncomplain I'm going too fast. This is really not my idea of how I wanted to \r\nspend my day off. ",
        "\r\nReva: Hi, guys. ",
        "\r\nFrank: Hi, Reva. ",
        "\r\nBuzz: Hey, Reva. All right, let's go. (Grunting) funny, Frank. Funny. ",
        "\r\nReva: Holly, hi. Thanks for seeing me. ",
        "\r\nHolly: What's wrong? ",
        "\r\nReva: I'm going crazy. Josh is furious at me. ",
        "\r\nHolly: Oh, honey. You must know why he's so upset right now. ",
        "\r\nReva: Yeah, of course I do, but I also know that that picture of him paying \r\noff Vreeland is a fake, and it's killing me that I can't prove it. ",
        "\r\nHolly: Remember that little word I keep bringing up, objectivity? You \r\nknow, you always let your emotions just take over. ",
        "\r\nReva: It's a little difficult not to when that ridiculous photo shows up on the \r\nfront page of the \"journal.\"\r\nHolly: I ran that paper... That picture because it's news, and news is my \r\njob. ",
        "\r\nReva: But it's not the truth, Holly. ",
        "\r\nHolly: Well, all right. If it's a fake, tell me this: Who wants to destroy \r\nJosh? Why? ",
        "\r\nOlivia: Hi, beautiful. ",
        "\r\nHolly: Hi. ",
        "\r\nReva: Hi. ",
        "\r\nHolly: You look chipper. ",
        "\r\nOlivia: You mean, for a woman whose husband's reputation was nearly \r\ndestroyed? Let me give you something to think about, Reva: Josh needs \r\nsomeone in his life who will support him, not humiliate him in public. But I \r\nguess that's where our roles differ, isn't it?",
        "",
        "\r\nReva: That picture was a fake. ",
        "\r\nOlivia: A very convincing one, considering how devastated Josh has been. ",
        "\r\nReva: No one who knows Josh would ever believe he was capable of \r\nbribery, and that is not just my subjective take on the matter. Josh virtually\r\n\r\nhad no contact with Vreeland. He didn't even meet the man until the harbor \r\nproject was already up and running. Am I right? ",
        "\r\nOlivia: You're right. ",
        "\r\nReva: I believe you were the one that took care of all the meetings in San \r\nCristobal. ",
        "\r\nOlivia: What are you implying? ",
        "\r\nReva: Just that you were the one that had hands-on relations with people \r\nlike peter Vreeland. ",
        "\r\nOlivia: So what if I did? Cassie's commission found no irregularities with \r\nthis project, let alone a systematic policy of bribing officials. ",
        "\r\nHolly: Those are the facts. ",
        "\r\nOlivia: And when the rest of the facts come out, Josh will be cleared of \r\nany wrongdoing, and then I guess you'll be off the hook. ",
        "\r\nHolly: Why? What does that mean? ",
        "\r\nOlivia: You don't know Reva's part in all this? Oh, my, have I got a scoop \r\nfor you. ",
        "\r\nReva: Oh, you know, stop, really. ",
        "\r\nOlivia: That doctored photograph-- and yes, I know it's a fake-- came from \r\nthe office of a man who worked for Gus Aitoro, Springfield's newest \r\ndetective. ",
        "\r\nHolly: Why is Gus Aitoro involved in this? ",
        "\r\nOlivia: Because our favorite Telejournalist hired him. You win some, you \r\nlose some, hey, Reva? See you. ",
        "\r\nReva: That mealy-mouthed, lying little witch. She's going to ruin Josh yet. ",
        "\r\nWhy are you looking at me like that? ",

        "\r\n\r\nTony: You sound pretty sure of yourself there. ",
        "\r\nSam: I should. I have the original disk, Tony. That'll prove who was really \r\nthere to make the payoff. ",
        "\r\nTony: Before the picture was messed with. ",
        "\r\nSam: Attaboy. You catch on fast. So all I have to do is get that disk into \r\nthe right hands, and Josh Lewis is in the clear. And so am I, with Marah. So I\r\n\r\njust stopped by to thank you in advance for all the quality time that she and I\r\n\r\nwill be spending very soon. ",
        "\r\nTony: You know, you deserve it. You're the man. You better get out of \r\nhere before I die of respect. ",
        "\r\nSam: Sure. See you. And you, by the way, you look great pushing a \r\nbroom. It works. ",

        "",
        "\r\nHolly: You sicced a private eye onto Josh? Why would you do something \r\nlike that? ",
        "\r\nReva: Now who's not being objective, Holly? She said two words to you, \r\nand you've already locked in all your conclusions. ",
        "\r\nHolly: Did you hire Gus Aitoro or not? ",
        "\r\nReva: Yes, but not to bring Josh down. I knew Olivia was up to something \r\ndirty, and I wanted to prove it.",

        "\r\nBuzz: Come on, head up there. The sheetrock's calling. Come on. ",
        "\r\nReva: I saw the original photo. The person paying Vreeland all that cash \r\nwasn't Josh, it was Olivia-- only someone switched the photo right before the\r\n\r\ndebate. ",
        "\r\nHolly: So this is your word against the evidence. ",
        "\r\nReva: Cassie saw it, too. ",
        "\r\nHolly: Oh, your sister, your loyal sister. ",
        "\r\nReva: I'm sorry, did you see the look on Olivia's face? You know why she \r\nwas so smug right now? It was because she's up to her eyeballs in trouble, and\r\n\r\nshe knows I can't nail her on it... Yet. But she's enjoying all the trouble I'm\r\n\r\ninto trying to do it. ",
        "\r\nHolly: Reva. You're my friend, and I want what's best for you. ",
        "\r\nReva: Well, then save me the lectures, Holly, you know, because I've been \r\nbeating myself up enough already. I've had enough. ",
        "\r\nHolly: I am the last person to lecture anybody in the world about their life \r\nchoices. ",
        "\r\nReva: Yeah, but what? But? But? ",
        "\r\nHolly: But maybe you need to face why you got involved in this whole \r\nJosh/Olivia situation. ",
        "\r\nReva: Really? And what would that be? ",
        "\r\nHolly: Well, maybe it's got nothing to do with exposing corruption in San \r\nCristobal, or nailing Edmund for being the crook that he is. Maybe you threw \r\nyourself into this whole mess because you want to get your ex-husband back.",

        "\r\nHolly: No? ",

        "\r\nHolly: I want you to understand how I feel, where I'm coming from on \r\nthis. Now, you said that the photo of Olivia handing the money over to \r\nVreeland was the real one and the one of Josh was the fake. What makes you \r\nso sure it's not the other way around? ",

It hasn't been proven yet,\r\n\r\nexcept in your brain, because you're so sure that Josh wouldn't do something \r\nas rotten as... ",

        "\r\nHolly: Yeah, of course. I know. Sometimes it's impossible to separate the \r\npersonal from the professional. Look, I'll say one more thing, and then we can\r\n\r\nleave it: Just be careful that you're not reacting to things just because your \r\nlife \r\nis so much up in the air right now. ",
