Mail again.", "Reva: What are you doing?", "Sandy: Uh...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Joey: Tammy, I've got to talk to you. It's about me and lizzie and...", "Tammy: And what?", "Joey: Have you been drinking? Is someone else here?", "Tammy: I had a couple of beers, yeah. So what?", "Joey: Are you okay?", "Tammy: Now, hold it. Hold it. Okay, you didn't come here to talk, not really. You came here to talk about us, right?", "Joey: Tammy, I came here to...", "Tammy: So, that's what we'll do. And I'll go first.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Blake: Hey, daddy, it's me again. Chrissie. Look, would you call me back? I tried calling amanda and her secretary said that she moved to italy four months ago? Good riddance. Of course, I can't believe you didn't tell me. Anyway, your letter said that you were coming into springfield, I think today, but it didn't give me a time or where you were staying and do you need anything from me? I mean, can I make a reservation for you? Pick you up at the airport or... can I do anything for you? I mean, other than what you asked me to do in your letter. Oh, daddy, I'm so glad you're coming. There's a lot going on here right now and I really need you. I love you. Ugh.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: What are you doing, edmund? Making sure that dinah is really gone?", "Edmund: If ross weren't mayor, he would have gotten a speeding ticket for how fast he drove his daughter out of here.", "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, maybe he just wanted to get her out of here because someone might pinch him and wake him up.", "Edmund: Well, one man's dream is another man's nightmare, i suppose.", "Jeffrey: Yeah, well it certainly isn't your nightmare, is it? I mean, I was watching you when cassie made her statement. You seemed deeply relieved.", "Edmund: Well, you didn't seem entirely unhappy about the outcome yourself. Of course, that's no surprise considering dinah is holding the secret of your little stint as richard's undercover double over your head.", "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, it would have been a long, ugly trial, right edmund? And the whole point of the matter was to spare cassie the ordeal of having to relive hart's death yet again in court.", "Edmund: That was the theory of the idea, at least.", "Jeffrey: Well, then, I'm happy that we could avoid a trial, and I'm happy for her.", "Ross: So, what's going on? Where's dinah?", "Jeffrey: She's with you.", "Edmund: You picked her up and drove away. I saw the car myself.", "Ross: What are you talking about? I just got here.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dinah: My god, would you slow down? Please?", "Cassie: It's okay. I know this road well.", "Dinah: Where are we going?", "Cassie: To talk. Is something wrong?", "Dinah: Yeah. I thought you were my father when I got in the car. I thought that maybe...", "Cassie: You thought what? That it was over because I made a statement and you were just going to walk away? No. That is not how it's going to happen.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ross: Jeffrey, I drove around the entire block. Dinah is not outside.", "Jeffrey: Terrific.", "Ross: I don't understand this.", "Edmund: Well, there are two things to come to grips with: Your daughter is nowhere to be found, and cassie is not answering her cell phone.", "Jeffrey: Edmund, didn't you say that you saw dinah get into ross's car and speed away?", "Edmund: I saw the taillights of a car as it sped away. I didn't see who was inside; it was too dark.", "Ross: But you assumed that dinah got in.", "Edmund: I also assumed you were behind the wheel. Obviously, I'm an idiot and all bets are off right now, aren't they?", "Jeffrey: Take it easy. Let's just all take it easy here, okay?", "Edmund: Okay, hold on, hold on. Maybe... maybe... maybe... maybe cassie turned off her cell phone when she came in here and when she left, she was too upset to turn it back on, so... maybe she's gotten home by now...", "Ross: So, when did cassie leave here?", "Edmund: And exactly when, because I went to look for tammy. When I came back, cassie was gone.", "Jeffrey: Well, she would have made it back to the farm by now.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Come on, come on, cassie. Pick up. (Telephone ringing)", "Tammy: Joey, the way I see it... I mean, the way I feel... (telephone ringing) well, what I'm trying to say... ugh. What?", "Edmund: I'm trying to get hold of your mother.", "Tammy: She's not here.", "Edmund: Did she call or leave a message she was on the way?", "Tammy: No. Is something wrong?", "Edmund: No, no. No, nothing's wrong. I just need to find your mother, tammy. We're, um... we're going away tonight. We've planned a little trip and I just wanted to firm up the details with her.", "Tammy: She didn't say anything about a trip.", "Edmund: Well, it was a spur of the moment kind of thing. Just... when she calls, tammy, or comes back, can you just have her get in touch with me, please? It's important.", "Tammy: Okay.", "Edmund: You promise you'll tell her, right?", "Tammy: I said I would. That was weird.", "Joey: What was that about?", "Tammy: I don't know.", "Edmund: She's not there and there's no word from her. So, what do the facts tell us now?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: Well, they tell us that we have to consider the possibility that cassie may have been abducted by dinah.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dinah: Will you stop this car right now, please?", "Cassie: Soon. We're almost there.", "Dinah: We are driving awfully fast and awfully far for just a talk, cassie.", "Cassie: Relax, dinah. We're not going to cross the state line. Plus, you know me. I like things to work out, people to get along. It must be the mom in me.", "Dinah: What is left to talk about?", "Cassie: Oh, there's a lot of things to talk about, because you're not going to jail now. And let's say you stay in springfield, how are we going to coexist in the same town, with our history?", "Dinah: I don't know.", "Cassie: Yeah, well. See? There's a lot to talk about.", "Dinah: Okay, if you are so concerned about coexisting, why did you not bring this up before?", "Cassie: As opposed to when?", "Dinah: At the police station, when you made your statement to jeffrey. I thought maybe you'd want to stick around, see if things could turn out before you have to change your story.", "Cassie: You mean, when I gave you your \"get out of jail free\" card?", "Dinah: I would think that the mommy in you would want some guarantee that everybody could get along.", "Cassie: I was tempted. I was tempted to have this conversation at the police station, but then I knew we couldn't have the discussion honestly and openly, so...", "Dinah: Why not?", "Cassie: Because, dinah, you would have been picking and choosing every single thing that came out of your mouth to make me change my mind and tell jeffrey everything that really happened.", "Dinah: You are serious about this.", "Cassie: Spending time alone with you is the last thing i want to do.", "Dinah: Yeah, but here we are. We are all alone.", "Cassie: Yes. Here we are. Because we have to get to a place where we understand each other, some place where we're on neutral ground and we can talk openly. Where hart's ghost isn't hovering over us.", "Dinah: Okay, did you really think I wouldn't open up unless you kidnapped me?", "Cassie: I took a huge chance on you tonight, dinah, and now i have to make sure I made the right choice. And I only have one shot at it, and then you can finally, really be free. So sit back. We're almost there.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: My mom's not answering her cell.", "Joey: Okay, well, don't you think he would have tried her on her cell before he tried here?", "Tammy: I don't know! I'm just... I'm trying to figure out why he was so freaked. And it can't be about a stupid trip. Or maybe it is and I'm just...", "Joey: What?", "Tammy: Making a bigger deal out of it than it is because i don't know how to say what i want to say to you.", "Joey: No, tammy. Look, you don't owe me any explanations. I know you're mad at me.", "Tammy: Mad and all kinds of things, joey. God, I am all screwed up because of you.", "Joey: I know. You feel like I totally betrayed you.", "Tammy: Well, you did.", "Joey: Tammy, there's more to it than that.", "Tammy: You're right. I don't think all this stuff that I've been doing is because of how much you hurt me. Because it hurts even more not to be with you. And I don't want to hurt anymore, joey.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: This whole mother and son thing is new to us, but we will get it, I promise, because I will remember that you are a grownup and if you ask me to back off, I will.", "Sandy: Really?", "Reva: Well, I'll try. That is, as long as you promise to tell me if you have a problem or something that I can help you with.", "Sandy: There is one thing.", "Reva: Oh, good. Name it.", "Sandy: Well, I'm ravenous. Who do you got to know to get some food in this place?", "Reva: (Laughs) well, I do happen to have an in. You see, I was married to the owner at one time. So, good. We'll eat something and then we'll get to work.", "Sandy: All right. On what?", "Reva: On the feature for my show that we were talking about. You know, the dynamics of families who adopt?", "Sandy: I thought we were doing the one on the rock the vote project.", "Reva: Well, yeah. We can do both. I'd love to see what information you've gotten together for that.", "Sandy: Oh, I... I don't have that completely fleshed out just yet.", "Reva: In other words, butt out. That's fine. We'll go back to plan \"A.\" I met this terrific woman. Her name is gloria and she has an adopted son and she's agreed to do a pre-interview for us.", "Sandy: Really? When?", "Reva: Ooh, actually she's going to meet us here in about ten minutes, so I suggest that we get cracking and get our homework done.", "Sandy: Okay.", "Reva: This was the... what I'm looking at as far as openings.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: As mad as I am and i am mad-- madder than I've ever been at anybody in my life-- i can't hate you...", "Joey: But I...", "Tammy: Slept with lizzie. I know. I know. And I hate that. After I told you that I never wanted to see you again, I kept thinking about you. And lizzie.", "Joey: What do you mean?", "Tammy: I've known her for a lot longer than you have, joey. And I know the kind of stuff that she can pull when she wants something. Or someone. She'll manipulate them and jerk them around and hurt them. And the whole time she still think she's being your friend.", "Joey: Yeah, it's pretty scary.", "Tammy: Lizzie tried to come between us for a long time, joey. Because she wanted to be your girlfriend. And all of a sudden you slept with her? Why should I think that that's just some sickening coincidence? Joey, what if she some how tricked you into it?", "Joey: Tricked me?", "Tammy: Set you up. You kept saying that you don't remember what happened that night.", "Joey: Yeah, and you thought i was lying to you.", "Tammy: Yeah, I did. But what if someone did get you drunk, joey? Or how about this? Gave you some kind of drug. What if it was lizzie?", "Lizzie: Joey, I put something in your drink, but listen. I didn't do it knowing that you would forget everything that happened between us. I just did it for fun, okay.", "Tammy: Is any of that night coming back to you? Please tell me that it is. Tell me that lizzie somehow made you sleep with her. Please. I want to blame her, joey.", "Joey: If I told you the truth, would you believe me?", "Tammy: Yes. It still hurts to know that you spent the night sleeping next to some other girl. Especially lizzie. But I would try really hard to get past it. Especially if it meant getting back what we had together, joey. We were so great together. I loved you. Please tell me I don't have to throw that away.", "Lizzie: You don't have to go. Okay, just promise my dad you won't tell anybody about me drugging you.", "Joey: What? And just forget all that happened, lizzie?", "Lizzie: Well, he's serious. I mean he really will send you away and take your mom's house away.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ross: I think I'm going to call blake, see if she's at the beacon.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: You do that. That's a good idea.", "Edmund: The beacon? The beacon?! What, do you think dinah stopped by olivia's bar for a celebratory shot and a beer?", "Jeffrey: Of course not. She's in that car with cassie. But you and ross going at each other isn't going to help matters, is it?", "Edmund: You're so proud of yourself, mr. O'neill. You brought cassie along so artfully, so skillfully. Now she may be beyond everyone's help.", "Jeffrey: What are you talking about?", "Edmund: You made it so convenient for her to change her story about hart's murder. You know, one would think you planned it this way along.", "Jeffrey: Edmund, cassie's statement was 100% her decision.", "Edmund: Of course it was. After you drilled into her just how awful the trial was going to be for her and her family, and by inference how much easier her life was going to be if she didn't testify against dinah.", "Jeffrey: I didn't twist her arm. It was her call, edmund.", "Edmund: You also didn't tell cassie the real reason you didn't want the case to go to trial.", "Jeffrey: My so-called agenda. Is that it?", "Edmund: Dinah, would have gone public with the fact that you were secretly impersonating richard.", "Jeffrey: Come on. I don't even have time for this.", "Edmund: Make it. Cassie would have believed it, too. And she would have been so disgusted by you, she would have turned against you forever.", "Jeffrey: Edmund...", "Edmund: And you couldn't have risked that, given your feelings for her.", "Jeffrey: Back off!", "Edmund: So you had to keep dinah quiet, didn't you? And this is how you did it. You steered cassie just enough to make her decide to change her story. You had all the angles covered, didn't you, mr. O'neill? All of them except one. You didn't know how to keep cassie safe. Because of that she may be dead right now. And you know what? I should return the favor.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dinah: So this is your neutral territory, huh?", "Cassie: Yeah. Perfect, isn't it? No one knows we're here. Not a house around for miles. No one to interrupt us.", "Dinah: Well, you certainly thought of everything.", "Cassie: Yes, I have. Now we can say all the things that we've been wanting to say. We can scream at the top of our lungs and no one's going to hear us.", "Dinah: Cassie, I don't want to scream at you.", "Cassie: You say that now.", "Dinah: I want to move on with my life. I want to move on with the life that you gave me back.", "Cassie: That's good. See, that's good. It sounds like you've changed, like you turned over a new leaf.", "Dinah: I have. And, quite honestly, this location, the woods, this is not very liberating to me. A place like this gives me the creeps.", "Cassie: I can understand.", "Dinah: What is this?", "Cassie: It's a .22 semi- automatic. I keep it at the farm. I've been looking at it a lot since you showed up.", "Dinah: You said you wanted to talk.", "Cassie: Yeah, I did, didn't I?", "Dinah: You said you wanted to work things out.", "Cassie: I lied. Coming up on \"guiding light\"...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: Sandy's not my son. He's an imposter.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ross: I think I should just go over to the beacon, see if blake and dinah or both of them are there.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: There's no answer at the farm. I'm going over there.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: I'm going with you. That's not debatable.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dinah: Go ahead. Shoot me. oprah: The woodchopper and the mill", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: Joey, say something.", "Joey: I don't know how to start.", "Tammy: Well, if it makes you feel any better, this is all coming as a surprise to me, too. I had no clue I was going to say all this stuff. But every word is true. And I think what you said about us is true, too.", "Joey: What'd I say?", "Tammy: That it was wrong of me to just walk away from what we... joey, tell me you still feel the same.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: You can stay and your mom will be able to keep her house. You're going to have to...", "Joey: What? Lizzie, take an oath of silence and be your boyfriend? No, thanks. I don't ever want to see you again.", "Lizzie: Joey, wait. That's not a good decision, okay? You won't be able to come back here again. He'll make sure of it.", "Joey: You weren't wrong, tammy. I slept with lizzie.", "Lizzie: I know. But you said...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Joey: I wanted to sleep with her. She didn't have to slip me drugs. She didn't have to get me drunk or anything. No tricks. Because it was my choice.", "Tammy: What? You said you don't remember anything that happened that night.", "Joey: No, tammy, I remember every minute of it. I just pretended to forget so... so I didn't hurt you.", "Tammy: No.", "Joey: The bottom line is, tammy, I knew what I was doing.", "Tammy: You can't just...", "Joey: What? What, tammy? Just change my story like that? That morning what I fed you was the story. A big fairy tale, tammy. And this, what I'm telling you now, this is the truth. I had sex with lizzie after i won the spaulding contest because I was pumped, because i wanted to celebrate.", "Tammy: (Crying) we were going to celebrate.", "Joey: Yeah, well, I wanted someone, and lizzie was there. So wham bam.", "Tammy: Someone?", "Joey: Yeah. Someone who was experienced. Someone who knew what they were doing. That's definitely lizzie and definitely not you.", "Tammy: Oh, god.", "Joey: Look, tammy, I thought you should know, because it's fair. I didn't want to leave you hanging after I was gone.", "Tammy: Gone? What are you talking about?", "Joey: I knew you and I were completely done and over with. Through. So I made plans.", "Tammy: For?", "Joey: College. A slot opened up at B.U. In boston. I'm going. You know, a chance like that happens, you just have to jump on it.", "Tammy: Then why didn't you just go? Why did you have to do this to me?", "Joey: You wanted the truth, okay? Now you have the truth. You shouldn't feel bad, tammy. We weren't meant to be anyway. I mean, we're two different people who want two different things. So take care of yourself. (Tammy crying)", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: Thanks so much, gloria for meeting us here. This is jonathon. Well, actually he's my son, but everybody calls him sandy. And he's going to be working on the show.", "Gloria: Oh, you work with your son. That must be a dream come true.", "Sandy: Actually, I'm a pain in the butt. I'm the guy who reminds reva that we have deadlines and a production schedule. P.S., We really should get started.", "Reva: Oh. Okay. I guess it is a little late. So I guess the thing that I'm most curious about are your feelings toward your adopted son. I mean, I can only imagine what they must be.", "Gloria: Well, let's see how close you are.", "Reva: I would think that you love that child as if he were your own, completely and unconditionally.", "Gloria: I can't conceive of it any other way.", "Reva: I guess I should apologize. This whole thing is a charade. Sandy's not my son. He's an imposter. A fake. A grifter.", "Sandy: How do you figure that?", "Reva: Oh, I found out the truth from your computer. Right here. This child here integrated himself into our lives. Why? Because jonathon's entitled to a big fat inheritance. Can you believe what some people will stoop to?", "Gloria: He seemed so nice.", "Reva: Oh, well, that's the biggest weapon in his arsenal. Oh, yeah. That and the fact that he plays on your sympathy.", "Sandy: Reva, it's not...", "Reva: Fooled you again, didn't I? You thought I was going to buy all this hook, line and sinker. Well, get ready. This is where he usually cranks up some garbage about how all he really wanted was to be the part of some real family. Instead of having to deal with all the stuff he had to deal with being raised by his low life parents who raised him. Tune up the violins. I could hear him coming.", "Gloria: You should be ashamed of yourself.", "Reva: Oh, no, but he wants us to feel sorry for him. When all I feel is like I'm losing jonathon all over again! Sandy? Sandy? Are you sure you're okay?", "Sandy: Everything's great. Let's get back to work.", "Reva: (Laughs) okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: This is all your fault. You wanted dinah on the street from the beginning.", "Jeffrey: Edmund, get your hands off of me or I'm going to put you in the hospital.", "Ross: All right. All right.", "Jeffrey: Now!", "Ross: Stop it. This is not going to solve anything.", "Jeffrey: Thank you, ross. Did you speak with blake?", "Ross: No, I didn'T. She's not picking up her cell phone.", "Edmund: Hey, maybe dinah nabbed her, too. Why not? The car was big enough.", "Jeffrey: All right, why don't you get out of here if you can't start thinking rationally and behaving yourself?", "Edmund: Because it's not a rational situation. And you of all people should know that.", "Ross: Why would edmund be blaming you for all of this?", "Edmund: I don't know. Because I signed the release papers that set your daughter free. Because I'm the easy target. I don't know, ross. I just wish that this didn't happen.", "Ross: Jeffrey, we don't even know what \"this\" is. I have to believe there's a simple explanation for what's going on. You don't agree.", "Jeffrey: You want me to lie to you, ross?", "Ross: I think I should just go over to the beacon, see if blake and dinah or both of them are there.", "Jeffrey: That's a good idea. And if you hear anything, or if you find out anything, let me know, okay?", "Ross: All right.", "Edmund: There's no answer at the farm. I'm going over there.", "Jeffrey: I'm going with you. That's not debatable. Call me when you get to the beacon.", "Ross: I will. Please let us all be wrong.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dinah: What would you like me to do?", "Cassie: Doesn't matter to me.", "Dinah: I know what you want and I'm way ahead of you. I will steer clear of you and your family. You wouldn't even know I'm around.", "Cassie: You don't know what i want, but you're about to find out fast.", "Dinah: We should talk.", "Cassie: It won't change anything. I know what I have to do.", "Dinah: Look, what are you going to do, kill me?", "Cassie: Put it this way: The alternatives wouldn't work. If I believed that you would leave me and my family alone, i would let you go, but I don'T. So I can'T.", "Dinah: You said it yourself in the car. This is going to be an entirely new situation.", "Cassie: I also said something about co-existing, but we both know that can't happen, right?", "Dinah: Yes, it can.", "Cassie: How long have you been on the run, dinah? Five years? And you have spent every minute blaming me, hating me, waiting to get back at me ever since you murdered hart. So here we are. The moment is here. But you're on my turf now. And I'm not going to play into your hands this time. I've learned a lot in five years.", "Dinah: The only reason I'm on your turf is because you came to the police station, changed your story, and got me out of there. I could have been in jail.", "Cassie: Jail's a joke, dinah. Did a prison sentence keep you away from me? No. Did the courts keep you away from me and my family? No. You won't stay away, so I have to make you stay away.", "Dinah: Sounds like revenge to me.", "Cassie: Yeah, well, it's justice. It's justice for hart, for me, my family. See, it's good for everybody, because I'm sparing my family and my friends from a long painful trial. I'm able to avoid all the nightmares rj would have if he found out that his so-called imaginary friend gunned down his father. We've been able to prevent some defense attorney from traumatizing tammy on the witness stand. As for me, there's no way in hell I would be able to marry edmund and move on with my life if I had to constantly look over my shoulder waiting for your shadow to be over me again. So I know what I have to do.", "Dinah: What? Kill me?", "Cassie: Yeah. If I get rid of you, I get rid of your shadow.", "Dinah: (Laughing)", "Cassie: You think this is funny? Everyone says your crazy, but this proves it.", "Dinah: You can't shoot me, cassie. I'm sorry; you can. But you won'T.", "Cassie: Why won't I?", "Dinah: Well, let's see. There's no way that you would pull that trigger. You're cassie layne. Are you going to murder somebody in cold blood? No, no, no. She was the princess. And princesses don't do that.", "Cassie: Yeah. Well, I'll rise to the occasion.", "Dinah: I don't think so. No, no. Because, see, you have convinced yourself over the years that you're better than I am, that you are miles above me in every possible way.", "Cassie: I am.", "Dinah: Really? You're just going to blow somebody away because she gets under your skin? Don't you think that's something I would have done? You know, come into town with a murderous rampage?", "Cassie: Maybe I want to do it first.", "Dinah: Oh, okay. Okay. Go ahead. Shoot me. Come on. Told you. You can't do it. You won't do it. Because you'd rather have a pack of wild boars tear you apart than rather sink to what you think my level is.", "Cassie: I've changed a lot since you left springfield, dinah. You don't watch people you love die before your eyes and not change.", "Dinah: Okay. Then are you so absolutely sure that rj and tammy and edmund are going to go unaffected from this? You're going to put your little precious family through a nasty trial? Because it's going to be yours, not mine.", "Cassie: Who says I'm going to get arrested?", "Dinah: You think you're going to get away with something like this?", "Cassie: I will if I'm car- jacked. By you. Brought to this remote location. By you. Threatened with my own gun. By you. I had to kill you in self- defense. Who wouldn't believe that?", "Dinah: You don't think they're going to figure out that's a lie?", "Cassie: No one's going to be around to tell them.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Cassie! Tammy? What the hell happened here? Tammy?", "Jeffrey: Looks like a little beer party.", "Edmund: This doesn't make any sense. She was here, and now she's not. Oh, man, what do we do? We let that lunatic back into cassie's life. And yes, mr. O'neill, I'm blaming myself, too.", "Jeffrey: Look, dinah's been fixated on cassie for years, okay/ completely obsessed with her. I don't see how that we were suppose to...", "Edmund: We were supposed to kill her. That's what we should have done. That would have taken care of it. Now it's too late. Tammy?! Tammy?!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ross: Blake? Where have you been? I've been looking all over town for you. And why aren't you picking up your phone?", "Blake: Well, I've been waiting for a very important phone call, and I just let the voice mail pick up all the rest.", "Ross: Well, I wish you would have taken my call, because we have a small problem with dinah.", "Blake: She didn't break out of jail, did she?", "Ross: She doesn't need to. She was released.", "Blake: What?", "Ross: Cassie made a statement under oath that cleared her. She said that dinah shot hart, but it was accidental.", "Blake: Oh, my god!", "Ross: So the charges were dropped. Dinah walks out of the police station and promptly disappears. And what's more, nobody knows where cassie is either.", "Blake: Oh, ross. Dinah... dinah's going to kill cassie.", "Ross: There's no proof of that.", "Blake: Look, you know what? When are you going to figure out, that dinah is out of control? Look at this. Cassie gets her off scot-free and what does she do? She repays her by kidnapping her.", "Ross: There's no reason to think that she's kidnapped anybody.", "Blake: I got to tell you something. You know, if my father were here this would never happen. Dinah would never get away with this.", "Ross: That's who you're waiting to hear from, isn't it? Did you call roger about dinah?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: What do you say we walk gloria out to her car on our way out?", "Sandy: I think I'm going to stick around and take some notes on the stuff we just talked about. And then I have those papers you gave me on cross creek to take over to bill. So...", "Reva: Oh, great. Okay. Well, then I guess I'll see you back home later.", "Sandy: Sure. D it was nice to meet you, gloria. Have a good night.", "Gloria: Oh, and you, too, sandy. Thank you.", "Reva: Thank you. This is so much fun working on this story together. Makes me feel closer to you. And that is a strictly objective non-overbearing mother comment. How about that?", "Sandy: Mm-hmm. Okay.", "Reva: See you later.", "Sandy: Bye.", "Reva: So are you parked on this side?", "Gloria: Just around the corner.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: You disappeared on me.", "Jb: I had things to do.", "Tammy: Like look through the window at company? You didn't even say goodbye.", "Jb: How would you know? You were passed out. Listen, babe, I'm not going to sit alone with you and wait until your mom gets home and i can explain why her little baby is all passed out on the couch hammered.", "Tammy: Well, my mom's not coming home. She and my uncle edmund are going out of town tonight. So no one's going to be home, except that little baby.", "Jb: And why are you telling me this?", "Tammy: Why do you think?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Blake: Bringing up roger in conversation and calling him are two very different things, ross.", "Ross: Please. I understand that.", "Blake: Besides, why wouldn't I mention him when dinah's the subject? I mean, it's a perfect fit. They were married.", "Ross: Yes, a marriage made in hell. Did you call roger about dinah's situation?", "Blake: No, I did not call roger about dinah.", "Ross: Good. Because the last thing we need is roger making a bad situation even worse.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jb: So, in other words, you want me to come back to your house with you? Is that the deal here?", "Tammy: Are you always like this?", "Jb: How am I?", "Tammy: Playing hard to get.", "Jb: No, no. I'm the easiest guy in the world. But I might have other plans tonight.", "Tammy: Really? More pressing than this? I think you might want to change your plans.", "Sandy: It is you.", "Tammy: So, you coming or what?", "Jb: How could I say no/ cousin.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: When was that? You're sure about that? Could be confirmed? All right. Well, get back to me. Thanks. Any sign of tammy?", "Edmund: None. She's gone.", "Jeffrey: Well, maybe not for long. Cassie's car was spotted. Or at least one that resembles hers to a \"T.\"", "Edmund: Where?", "Jeffrey: On route 12 heading towards laurel falls. The patrolman remember seeing the car because there were hardly any on the road.", "Edmund: This can't be good.", "Jeffrey: Look, edmund, if it is dinah, okay, and she does try something, cassie's not a pushover, right? I mean, she could handle herself, she can defend herself.", "Edmund: From a bullet? We kept a gun in here.", "Jeffrey: In the box lying around the house?", "Edmund: We kept it locked. Dinah's got it now.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: See, I thought this through well.", "Dinah: Good for you.", "Cassie: I came up here to clear my head, and then the idea came to me. And the more I thought about it, the more I thought this could work, yeah.", "Dinah: Cassie, this won't work.", "Cassie: Now you're scared. Because you know this will work. Who's going to doubt me, dinah? You've tried to kill me before. You stole my identity. You stalked me and my family. You see, that's what the police would call a pattern of behavior, a would-be killer.", "Dinah: Look who's got the gun in her hand now?", "Cassie: But it was in yours. You stole this from my home and then you forced me into the car. You marched me up here, marched me to the edge of the cliff. Yeah. What was I going to do? It was either you or me.", "Dinah: You're crazy.", "Cassie: No, this is the sanest thing I've ever done. Because living with the threat that you pose to my family? That's crazy.", "Dinah: Cassie, I told you this is all in the past.", "Cassie: Yes, it is. And it will be in just a few minutes.", "Dinah: Stop it. Stop it!", "Cassie: That's what you should have done, dinah. Before you came to town, you should have stopped. But you didn'T. You should have stayed away. But you didn'T. So here we are at the end after all these years later. But, you know what, I have to tell you, I kind of like this ending.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[NEXT_ON]", "Reva: Nothing you could say will shock me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sandy: What if I said that i killed somebody.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: You have ten seconds to live. That's nine more that you gave hart before you blew him away."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Boo"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZfkOAspxnw"}
