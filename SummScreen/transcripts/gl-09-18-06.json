        "Billy: It's risky.",
        "Reva: What do you want me to do, rob a bank?",
        "Billy: No, but when you hear my idea, you'll think robbing a bank is a good idea.",

        "Lizzie: We're newlyweds, we do it anywhere and everywhere. We came down to see Tammy and she wasn't here, so we got busy. Would you like some details or maybe a little show?",
        "Dr. Baker: All right, I'm going. But we all know that Alan is not going to let this go as long as he thinks Lizzie's baby is in danger.",

        "Reva: I can only imagine.",
        "Billy: You don't know them. They're all from out of town. All they care about is the size of the amount of cash you bring with you. As a matter of fact, the game is close today. In fact, it is very close. I think that is kind of kismet, don't you?",
        "Reva: You're saying because this game is high stakes, I could possibly win back enough cash to pay off the medical bills?",
        "Billy: And then some.",

        "Billy: I told you you'd prefer robbing a bank.",
        "Reva: It gets worse and worse-- gambling in order to divorce the man I love.",
        "Billy: I didn't say it was a good plan, but it will definitely work. So, what do you say?",
        "Reva: I say luck be a lady tonight.",

        "Josh: No, I don't, really. Reva has a thing for lost causes, but she also knows when the writing is on the wall.",

        "Josh: I just am.",
        "Cassie: Then why didn't she sign the papers?",
        "Josh: I don't know. She made some typical Reva excuse. I can't tell you that I understand.",
        "Cassie: Maybe she is stalling.",
        "Josh: It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter, because it doesn't change the way I feel. I'm ready to move on.",
        "Cassie: And if she's not?",
        "Josh: Okay, all right.",
        "Cassie: What?",

        "Cassie: Bad idea.",
        "Josh: You and I are a good idea. That much I do know.",
        "Cassie: She might not agree with that.",
        "Josh: Cassie, we've had to fight to be together every step of the way. We've had to fight other people's perceptions, we've had to fight Hawk and Billy and Reva, but it was worth it. It's worth it. And the fight's not over, so just come with me, okay?",

        "Billy: She's good people. I'll vouch for her.",
        "Henderson: I don't care if she is the pope. I like to know who I'm playing with. The table's full.",
        "Reva: Well how do ya like that. Here Billy talked you guys up and they're nothing but a bunch of nervous nellies.",
        "Henderson: You'd be nervous, too, if you knew what the stakes were.",
        "Reva: Gentlemen, well, now, if you're worried about what I bring to the table...",
        "Henderson: Well, what do you know? A spot just opened up.",
        "Reva: What do you know?",

        "Reva: Thank you.",
        "Henderson: So what do you play?",
        "Reva: Well, I kind of like that game called Texas hold 'em. But it was the only one I could figure out watching celebrity poker on TV.",
        "Henderson: So you learned how to play watching television?",
        "Reva: Yes, I sure did. But it looks like it will be a heck of a lot more fun in person.",

        "Lizzie: Maybe climbing down from our room wasn't that good of an idea.",
        "Jonathan: I still wonder how Dr. Baker found out I was in this room.",
        "Lizzie: Get there quick and you'll catch the guy in bed with someone who's not his wife. I think I'm a little winded from all of that fake sex we've been having.",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie, we're going. I want to hear someone tell me you're okay.",
        "Lizzie: Um, Tammy, you really think you should go? I mean, if Dr. Baker is going to be watching your room all night, we kind of said you weren't here.",
        "Jonathan: This guy is really starting to piss me off. She's right, you should probably stay here.",
        "Tammy: But I want to go with you guys. If Lizzie needs something...",
        "Jonathan: All right, all right. But let us go to the hospital and just stay here until you think the coast is clear and then you can follow us, okay?",

        "Ava: Tell me something. Why do you hate me so much?",
        "Olivia: Why do I hate you? Why do I hate you? Why do I hate you? Let's start with the fact you're a phony. You wrap men around your bony little finger, and you almost took my daughter away from me. Do you even understand what that means?",
        "Ava: You don't know anything about me. Do you know my worst memory?",
        "Olivia: I hope it still hurts!",
        "Ava: Holding my mom in my arms and begging her not to leave me when she was dying. I know something about hurt.",
        "Olivia: You don't love me, you never have. You don't even want me. I hate you. Mom, mom, mom!",
        "Ava: I think about hurt every day, and I know that you're hurting, and it is more than just Emma, I know that. But, believe me, why don't you let me help you? Just stop.",

        "Olivia: I am goal-oriented and fierce, and I will do whatever I can to protect my family and the people I love. If I wasn't an actor, I would probably be locked up somewhere. You know what? I'd be a lawyer. It is probably the same thing as being an actor. See Olivia, Wednesday, September 20, \"Inside The Light.\"",

        "Coop: We're sorry about what happened to the baby, but this has got to stop.",
        "Olivia: That's right, take her side. I have a daughter in a coma. Emma may never wake up. And I have that Springfield blogger crucifying me. I've got this pixie up my nose. I guess I'm getting what I deserve.",

        "Henderson: Back to this cancer thing, are you...?",
        "Reva: Terminal? Well, that's what I'm here to find out. You see, I came out of desperation to raise enough money for my treatment.",
        "Henderson: So you're broke, and you're here gambling what you have left today?",
        "Reva: Well, you've probably noticed how conservative I've been. Oh, yeah. Oh, golly. I actually haven't even told my kids. No one. I just thought maybe I could beat this thing on my own, even if it kills me. I'm all in.",

        "Olivia: Why don't you try to understand me for once? Stop judging me and trying to change me. All I want is a life of my own. Dr. Waller, I wasn't expecting to see you here. You ran the tests. What can you do for my daughter?",

        "Jonathan: You're on Alan's payroll, too.",
        "Ms. Vaughn: Mr. Randall, let's stick to Miss Spaulding...",
        "Jonathan: You have a file on us. How about you? I guess you're registered as a social worker. You want us to go into your bank account and find out how much money the Spaulding's are paying you?",
        "Lizzie: What are you going to tell the judge?",
        "Jonathan: She is not going to tell the judge anything. You get out of here. If I find out you filed a damaging report, if I so much as sniff you in our lives ...",
        "Tammy: Is everything okay?",
        "Jonathan: It's fine.",
        "Tammy: Who was that?",
        "Lizzie: Alan paid off a social worker to mess with us.",
        "Tammy: Did she?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, but it's no big deal. What's up, Officer Remy?",
        "Remy: Not much, just helping where I'm needed.",
        "Tammy: He got me out of the hotel. He's on our side.",
        "Jonathan: Thank you. I'm sorry about that. It's just everything going on, it is getting out of hand. I don't even know who I can trust anymore. We get rid of one person, and then there's another one. I hate doing this to you.",
        "Tammy: Well, we knew this was going to get rough.",
        "Jonathan: I don't know, it's just getting more complicated every day.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan...",
        "Jonathan: We could lose this baby. I know what this is doing to you. You need to have a police escort to leave your room.",
        "Tammy: So what are you saying?",
        "Jonathan: I'm saying that ... I think you and I have to cool it for a while.",
        "Tammy: We've been sneaking around, but we've been managing, and it's kind of fun, right?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I know. But it just right now stopped being fun. It's not a game.",
        "Tammy: I know. I would never do anything to put your baby at risk.",
        "Jonathan: I know that. But the pressure right now, you can't get away from it. I feel like it is a matter of time before we get caught. I mean if Lizzie didn't warn us tonight...",
        "Tammy: I know.",
        "Jonathan: And who knows what that social worker is going to say to the judge? You know you are my world. And I would do anything and everything in my power to keep us together.",
        "Tammy: I know.",
        "Jonathan: I just... I feel like the only way to do that and to keep this baby... I mean, we have to make the marriage to Lizzie look as real as possible.",
        "Tammy: Okay, let's go back to the room and figure it out.",
        "Jonathan: I can't. We can't go back to the room together. We can't do anything together. Even talking like this is a risk.",
        "Tammy: You're right. So how long? How long do we have to wait?",
        "Jonathan: I don't know. I don't know how long I can last. I'll, um... I'll get a message to you later on.",
        "Tammy: We'll be okay. After all of this, it's going to be just you and me again.",
        "Jonathan: You're damn right.",
        "Remy: I'd ask if you're okay, but friends know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: That was pretty incredible.",
        "Jonathan: What?",
        "Lizzie: What you did in there. Tammy is the love of your life.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Yes, she is. Let's get out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Here. If I hadn't gotten here in time...",
        "Ava: If you hadn't gotten here in time, I know this is hard to believe, but I don't think she would have pushed me off.",
        "Coop: You're right, that is hard to believe. Ava, all she talks about is the Springfield Burns blog, and her past. What is all that?",
        "Ava: I don't know. Does it really matter right now?",
        "Coop: Maybe we should try to understand it.",
        "Ava: What good is that going to do?",
        "Coop: Ava, by understanding her past, maybe it will help us understand all of her quirks, all the craziness she's doing. What was on that page? What did it say?",
        "Ava: It just said something about Springfield mom not putting her family first. What does that mean?",
        "Coop: I don't know what it means. But obviously it means something to Olivia.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: You're tops in your field. You're saying there is nothing we can do?",
        "Dr. Waller: Unfortunately the tests we ran didn't come back with the results we hoped for. There are very serious limitations to the type of treatment for Emma.",
        "Buzz: So there is no telling when she is going to wake up?",
        "Dr. Waller: I have a few more options to look into, but right now our best hope is that she is strong enough to come out of it on her own. I'll keep you informed.",
        "Olivia: Limitations? I can't feel my legs. This can't be happening, not to my baby.",
        "Buzz: She's going to pull out of it.",
        "Olivia: What if she doesn't?",
        "Olivia's mother: All that matters is what you want. You are so selfish.",
        "Olivia: If I don't take care of what I want, who will? You know something, maybe I don't have everything all figured out, but I know what I don't want. I don't want to be trapped in a dead-end life, Mom. I don't want to be you. Go ahead and cry, Mom, because I'm not apologizing. You don't love me. You never have. I already care more about this baby, my baby, and its future, way more than you have ever cared about me. I can't lose another baby. Not again. I promised myself, never again. Never again.",

        "Billy: You know, I've been around a long time, and I have never seen anybody use terminal cancer to help a poker bluff. You're shameless.",
        "Reva: Well, I never had much use for shame, and this bag is heavy.",
        "Billy: Well, it won't be for long.",
        "Reva: I know. Now I can sign the divorce papers and send Josh and Cassie on their happy little way and say good-bye, with nothing standing in my way except my heart.",
        "Billy: I'm sorry that this big win had to turn into losing in the end.",
        "Reva: Well, you know what I keep thinking?",
        "Billy: What?",
        "Reva: Somebody had to win. Why not let it be Josh, you know? The whole thing sucks, but we can take the money and...",
        "Billy: (Laughs) Yeah.",
        "Reva: Joshua.",
        "Billy: What are you doing here?",
        "Josh: Well, I could ask you the same thing.",

        "Dinah: I forgot how much fun meaningless sex is.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, I'm happy I could oblige.",
        "Blake: Just cut the lawyer talk and remind me I still have what it takes.",
        "Olivia: I should have listened to her.",
        "Buzz: Who?",
        "Woman: You can't handle this. You're too young and selfish to raise a child. It will only suffer because you're its mother."
