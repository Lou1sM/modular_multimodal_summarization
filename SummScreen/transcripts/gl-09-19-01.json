        "\r\nTony: Hey, is this... Is this your handwriting? Did you take down these \r\nreservations? ",
        "\r\nRomeo: What's the problem? ",
        "\r\nTony: How many times do I have to tell you? You always take down a \r\nphone number. ",
        "\r\nRomeo: That guy's a regular. ",
        "\r\nTony: I don't care if he's my dad. ",
        "\r\nRomeo: Yo, yo, stop. You've been busting my chops all day. Now, I know \r\nyou're miserable, but hey, don't take it out on me, okay? ",
        "\r\nTony: Who says I'm miserable? ",
        "\r\nRomeo: Please. Your little heart's going all pitter-patter over Marah Lewis. ",
        "\r\nEnough, already. There are plenty of other blonde girls out there that you can\r\n\r\ngo for. ",
        "\r\nTony: I am over Marah Lewis. I am so over her. ",
        "\r\nRomeo: Oh, really? So how come you just did the whole knight-in-\r\nshining-armor routine on her dad? You set up Fingers Chavez so that he takes \r\nthe fall for Josh Lewis and you can look like some big hero in Marah's eyes, \r\nbut then you don't even let her know what you did. You let preppy Sam take \r\nall the credit for it. I don't get you, man. ",
        "\r\nTony: Look, if you... ",
        "\r\nRomeo: The chick is not worth all this agony, Tony. ",
        "\r\nTony: This is a... This is a business decision, pure and simple. ",
        "\r\nRomeo: Right. ",
        "\r\nTony: Look, Fingers is going to do some time. He's going to keep his \r\nmouth shut, okay? The spotlight is going to come off Lewis construction, and \r\nthe three families are still going to launder money through San Cristobal. This\r\n\r\nhas nothing to do with Marah. ",
        "\r\nRomeo: Look, you still did the girl a big favor, so I think you should show \r\nher what a Prince you really are, you know? Let her see what a big mistake \r\nshe's made. ",
        "\r\nTony: That's not how it works with me and Marah. Okay, look, the more \r\nright I do for her, the more wrong I am. I can't win with her. That's... (Sighs \r\n) \r\nI don't care anymore, you know? End of story.",

        "\r\nOlivia: Thank you for letting us have the press conference here. ",
        "\r\nFrank: Not a problem, not a problem. Actually, you know, when \r\neverybody shows up, I'll kind of get the crew to scoot out of here and stop \r\nmaking noise. I'll get you some menus. ",
        "\r\nOlivia: Thanks. ",
        "\r\nShayne: Oh, so could someone please tell me why we're doing this again? ",
        "\r\nMarah: Because there are going to be some reporters here asking dad a lot \r\nof questions, and we're going to be right by his side to show that we love him\r\n\r\nand support him 100%. ",
        "\r\nJosh: Thank you. ",

I got this call from him saying, \"you got\r\n\r\nto fill in because I'm going out of town.\" So no offense, this is not \r\nreally my \r\nidea of how to spend my day off. (Laughter)\r\nMarah: Do you think that we should go ahead and order so that our food is \r\nhere, you know, before the reporters get here? ",
        "\r\nOlivia: No, you know what? I think it's a better idea that we just... We take\r\n\r\nour time. We let them see us having a family meal together. You know, \r\nbusiness as usual, totally unfazed by all the accusations, right? ",
        "\r\nMarah: Yeah, totally unfazed. Dad's life is on the line. ",

        "\r\nJosh: Oh, come on over. The more the merrier. ",
        "\r\nOlivia: Yeah, come, come on. The press is going to be here soon. It will be \r\ngood if they could see the whole family together. ",
        "\r\nSam: Like I said, I can't. But, Josh, I will be thinking about you. Good \r\nluck. ",

        "\r\nSam: I don't think anyone in there cares what I think, especially you. ",

        "\r\nSam: And then it blew up in your face, and now I'm playing cover-up, and \r\nI hate it. ",
        "\r\nOlivia: Look, sweetheart, I know you're upset. ",
        "\r\nSam: Upset? Olivia, you put me in the worst position possible. You made \r\nme choose between protecting you and exposing that photo as a fake. And if I \r\nhad proven that photo was fake, I would have not only saved your husband's \r\ncareer, I would have won his daughter's affections. ",
        "\r\nOlivia: You chose to protect me, and I'm grateful for that. ",
        "\r\nSam: Only because you're my sister. ",
        "\r\nOlivia: It's because you know how important family is, Sam. That's why I \r\nneed you to come inside, okay? Come in and support us. If not for me, do it \r\nfor Marah. ",

        "\r\nSam: Would you? ",
        "\r\nOlivia: Yes, I would! Because I hate seeing what he's going through. But \r\nas long as I have options, I can't risk my marriage. I can't risk what the three\r\n\r\nfamilies are going to do to me, to him, everyone... ",
        "\r\nSam: Options? What options, Liv? That's what I want to know. Now that \r\nyou've gotten us all into this mess, what the hell are you going to do to get us\r\n\r\nout?",
