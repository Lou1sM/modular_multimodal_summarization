        "Reva: Joshua, what are you doing here?",
        "Josh: Look, I'm just here for the divorce papers, and then you guys can go on, continue to do whatever you were doing.",
        "Reva: Um, well, we've looked at the papers.",

        "Cassie: Hey, Blake, it's me. Are you screening? Pick up. Calling to see if you might be up for a girls' night out. And I am buying. Wow, you really aren't there. Hello, Harley's voice mail. I've got three words for you: Girls' night out. So when you get this message... (machine beeps) Hey, it's Cassie again. Your machine cut me off, which is really annoying. But anyway, when you get... (machine beeps) Are you sure it's the flu? Right. Right. Of course, you're the doctor, Mel. Okay. So you... no chance that Jude's going to be better by tonight? Okay. Here's the deal. Your mother needs a night on the town and no one is around, so you are it. I know it's lame to hang with your mom, but I gave you life, Tammy, 18 hours of labor. Call me. Hey, guys, who wants to get a couple of beers? Want to get some beer?",
        "Mallet: Yeah. Are you... how are you doing? You okay?",
        "Cassie: Sure, fine. I'm great. What? What, I can't take Springfield's finest out for a couple of brewskies? Come on. Okay. All right. Look, R.J.'s at a sleepover and I'm kind of on my own, and I just would like to hang.",
        "Frank: Well, you know what? We would love to do that, except we're kind of on duty right now, so...",
        "Cassie: Oh. All right, well. Hey, it's going to be your loss. It's going to be a good time. You guys are a couple of losers.",
        "Frank: I think you're... I think you have it the wrong way. It's the other one you want. Turn it around or use your other hand.",
        "Cassie: Okay, so, I'm the loser. Yeah.",
        "Frank: No, no. You're not alone. Mallet's a loser. I mean , did you hear about his non-wedding?",

        "Jeffrey: Well, I'm glad I could oblige. You're not... you're not mad at me for ruining the wedding?",
        "Dinah: Oh, well, I'll probably never forgive you for that, but what am I going to do? I believe I was suckered. I was suckered into believing that that was actually more fun when it had weight and depth and some meaning.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, let's not use words like that around here.",
        "Dinah: Oh that's right. I'm despicable. Never again.",
        "Jeffrey: Uh, what are you doing?",
        "Blake: What? I have a key. You gave it to me.",
        "Jeffrey: No, no, I didn't.",
        "Blake: All right. Then it was in the door. You know?",
        "Jeffrey: No. No, it wasn't.",
        "Blake: Okay. Here's the thing. The \"Springfield Mirror\" did an article on me today.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, look, Blake, this isn't a good time.",
        "Blake: Well, actually, it is a good time, because apparently I'm running out of it. According to them, I am the heroine for middle-aged moms. \"Middle- aged.\" What's up with that? I mean, that's... that's slander.",
        "Jeffrey: No, no, it's not.",
        "Blake: Excuse me?",

        "Coop: This giant ball of anger. And that doesn't just happen, Ava. All right, look, something in her past must have caused that, and I want to find out what it is. Now, first off, I want to go back to that Springfieldburns.com web site, and I'm going to figure out what that blogger has on her before... look, I'm sorry.",
        "Ava: What?",
        "Coop: No, I just... I'm sorry. No, look, I'm sorry. I can't shut up about Olivia. This is a perfect time for us. But unfortunately you and I are caught in the middle of this stupid mess and it's just... I'm not going do anything to get you to smile right now. Please? Something.",
        "Ava: Coop! There's nothing we can do.",
        "Coop: Oh yes, there is. Come on. Come here. Grab your stuff. Let's go.",

        "Olivia: I can't lose another baby, Buzz. I promised myself never again. Never again.",
        "Mother: You are humiliating all of us, Olivia. How did you let this happen to you? I told you never to trust men. As usually you go out and do just what I tell you not to do, and now you're in a world of trouble.",
        "Young Olivia: Why are you going crazy over this? It's not like I'm asking you to help me.",
        "Mother: Oh, you don't need my help. You've got it all figured out.",
        "Young Olivia: Yes, I do.",
        "Mother: You can't handle this. You're too young and selfish to raise a child. It will only suffer because you're its mother.",

        "Olivia: I can't do this. I can't do this again.",
        "Buzz: It's me. Look, we've been here, you know? You get upset, you disappear. Too scared to tell me what it's about, and then I get it out of you and I stay.",
        "Olivia: Don't. Don't.",
        "Buzz: Look. I don't scare off. You told me about your mother. I stayed. I'm here. Talk to me.",
        "Olivia: Never again. Never, never again.",
        "Buzz: What about again? What are you talking about?",
        "Olivia: Nothing. Philip took Emma. He tried to take her from me. Alan did the same thing. I just can't lose her. I can't lose her.",
        "Buzz: Would you tell me what's happening?",
        "Olivia: I just told you. I just told you.",
        "Buzz: Look, maybe you haven't slept enough. And I don't know, but...",
        "Olivia: I should have listened to her. I should have listened to her.",
        "Buzz: Who?",
        "Olivia: She said, \"Never trust them.\" \"Never trust them.\"",

        "Ava: What are you going to do, drive us there?",
        "Coop: I'm being serious here. I mean, come on. We can... we can take off, all right? We can see this countryside. We can get out of this town. We can do anything we want to. We can...",
        "Ava: What are you doing?",
        "Coop: I don't know. Look, maybe we can't go to England, all right? We can at least go to the beach, even if it is for just a couple of days. What do you say?",
        "Ava: What are you doing?",
        "Coop: Come on, I'm... oh. I'm just saying that since you and I have hooked up, we haven't had a chance to just be. I don't know about you, but I want that more than anything. And I know that you certainly do deserve it.",
        "Ava: I think that's really sweet that you want to whisk us away. But you know what? I can't leave. Emma's in the hospital. She's sick.",
        "Coop: Ava, you know better than I do that Olivia's not going to let you go anywhere near that hospital.",
        "Ava: I need to be here. It's the right thing for me to do.",
        "Coop: But you don't know. You don't need to... you don't need to be here. All right, we can just go. We can do anything. We need to be here. We can't be here. You can't be here.",
        "Ava: But I can't... Why can't I be here?",
        "Coop: No. You almost went over the edge of the balcony. All right? She almost pushed you off the balcony, Ava, and don't tell me I'm lying here.",
        "Ava: I'm fine, okay?",
        "Coop: Look, she's out of her mind. She's... Olivia is crazy. And there's no telling what she's going to do, and you know that.",
        "Ava: She's scared for her little girl, for Emma, okay? She hates me, but she's not going to do anything to me. I can handle myself. You don't need to worry about me, okay? You don't need to worry about me anymore.",
        "Coop: Fine. Fine. I trust you. Come here. Look, I've got to get back...",
        "Ava: Wait. What about going to England? Coop. Coop!",

        "Dinah: It's nighttime.",
        "Jeffrey: That's how I know it's late. See you.",
        "Blake: You work fast, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: I'm efficient. It feels as if you were about to marry Mallet just yesterday.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, yep. Yesterday.",
        "Blake: Have you no shame?",
        "Dinah: Whatever I have going on with Jeffrey, it is what it is, and it ain't much.",
        "Blake: Your father would be so proud.",

        "Bartender: What can I get you?",
        "Cassie: A glass of chardonnay, please. No, wait. Something stronger. Uh... no, the wine. I'll stick with wine. Would you make it a big glass, a really big glass?",
        "Bartender: Well, whatever you want. That gentleman offered to buy it.",
        "Cassie: No, thank you. That gentleman has gotten me into enough trouble.",

        "Dinah: Where are the girls, by the way?",
        "Cassie: Have a seat.",
        "Billy: Why don't I just get out of your hair?",
        "Cassie: That's a good idea, Billy, move it along. Move it right along, because that's what we're doing here. We're moving on. Life's too short.",
        "Billy: You got that right. Night, ladies.",
        "Dinah: What was that all about?",
        "Cassie: Can we not talk about it? It's girls' night out.",
        "Dinah: That's right. Yeah, that's right. Thank you. That's right. So, Josh.",

        "Mallet: What? Are you kidding me? What?",
        "Blake: Well, is it too long? Because, well, I have nice legs so I could... should it be shorter?",

        "Blake: What?",
        "Mallet: Oh, my God. Don't tell me you bought me over here-- you look fine, first of all. You bought me over here to help you with a makeover?",

        "Bartender: We don't do pitchers of wine.",
        "Cassie: Well, you should. You really should. You know what? I've decided I don't care what anybody says. Falling in love is always a mistake it just makes you too vulnerable.",

        "Cassie: Very unhealthy.",

        "Josh: I think we're past that.",
        "Reva: Well, I'm glad we're doing it like this, you know. Here, the two of us handling it like adults. No big scene, just really having a chance to say our good-byes.",
        "Josh: We're still going to see each other, Reva.",
        "Reva: No, it's different this time. I mean, this is it. This is the end.",

        "Reva: I'm already rooting you on, Joshua. But our lives, we won't be one life anymore.",
        "Josh: We couldn't make it work this time, but I'm not sorry we tried. We made a home together. We have two wonderful children. There's a lot of love, a lot of happiness, and some tears, and some hollering thrown in just to make it interesting. But our life, Reva. It was a good one. And I thank you for it, for all of it. And for knowing when to let it go.",
        "Reva: It's just so hard. I just want to say that you've been a better husband to me than I deserved. You never tried to break me, even though I broke you a few times. And you gave me beautiful children, the most precious children in the world-- a gift to the world. And I want to thank you for that-- always. And for never giving up on me.",
        "Josh: Are you all right?",
        "Reva: There's something you need to know, something you really need to know. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do. And I just hope that someday you'll understand why I had to do it this way.",

Frank Dicopoulos is a gorgeous man, and a ham. To be a part of this show that's been on the air for so long, it's an honor. I... every now and again it hits me that I'm a part of it, and it's just terrific.",

        "Mallet: Knock yourself out, because my saving Dinah days are over.",
        "Blake: No, no. You can't just let her give her life away and throw it to that loser, Jeffrey O'Neill.",
        "Mallet: Nice, nice. \"Ross would want me to help her out.\" Shame on you, Blake. Shame on you. Because this isn't about you helping your dead husband's daughter. This is about you wanting to shack up with Jeffrey O'Neill.",
        "Blake: Why can't it be both? Look, okay, okay. Of course I would like Jeffrey to want me, but I also want what's best for Dinah, and it's not Jeffrey. She needs somebody who's strong and solid. I had that. I had that, and that's never going to come back in my life. And it's not even what I'm looking for. What I have with Jeffrey, it just... at least it makes me feel alive. And Ross would want me to be happy. And Ross loved you. He loved you. And he would want you to be with Dinah.

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Fancy meeting you here.",
        "Mallet: Where's O'Neill?",
        "Dinah: How should I know? Oh, Blake, she really does need to get a life. What did she say?",
        "Mallet: This isn't about Blake.",
        "Dinah: Well, this isn't about Jeffrey. What?",
        "Mallet: This is what you're settling for?",
        "Dinah: You know, Cassie and I were having a grand old time until you showed up.",
        "Mallet: You were the one that came over here.",
        "Cassie: To get rid of you.",
        "Mallet: You did a pretty good job of that the other day.",
        "Dinah: Oh, no, no, see, because you were the one who walked away from me.",
        "Mallet: You walked away first.",
        "Dinah: You know what? You know what? You're right, Mallet. I am a lost cause and you're the last one to catch on because I thrive. I thrive on envy and jealousy. And it's been working for me up until now, so I must be doing something right, you know? I mean, I can't be this...",
        "Mallet: You know, we were real. We were real. And you bailed because you couldn't handle it. And I hope that whole hate/revenge/envy thing works for you. I'm just... I'm over it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I know what you're going through. No one knows better than I do what it's like to love Josh.",
        "Cassie: I don't get your brand of love, Reva. You reel Josh in, you toss him back out, you disappear on him, on all of us, with no explanation. No, don't compare us. I don't... I don't love like that.",
        "Reva: I have a lot to work out, but now I know what I have to do.",
        "Cassie: Well, good for you. I hope it was worth it.",
        "Reva: I signed the divorce papers, Cassie. My life with Joshua is over.",
        "Cassie: For now.",
        "Reva: No, for good. You should call him.",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Reva: I want him to be happy and you make him happy.",
        "Cassie: I can't believe...",
        "Reva: And he makes you happy too, doesn't he?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, but... no. Reva, don't mess with my head. I can't take it right now.",
        "Reva: I'm sorry I made you doubt me, but my life with Joshua has ended and now yours can start.",
        "Cassie: No, no. Uh-uh, no. Because you are just going to want him back. You're just going to want him back, and then where am I going to be? You can't dangle this kind of love in front of me just knowing that you're going to take him back when you're bored or lonely.",
        "Reva: No. No, you're wrong. You're here now, and this is your moment with Josh. This is your chance to have a beautiful life. Don't blow it.",

        "Jeffrey: Well, this is nice.",
        "Blake: Yes, I know.",

        "Blake: Not a chance.",

        "Dinah: Well, you look terrible.",
        "Cassie: Well, thanks. You look great yourself.",
        "Dinah: I wish I could blame it on the fried cheese.",
        "Cassie: I won't tell. So, you and Mallet?",
        "Dinah: I'm okay. What's your excuse?",
        "Cassie: I'm going to stick with the fried cheese.",
        "Dinah: I need to go home.",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Dinah: Are you okay to drive?",
        "Cassie: I think I'm going to call a cab, actually.",
        "Dinah: That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we'll share. Maybe not. Okay. Well, I'll see you later then.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, whenever. Whenever. Good night.",

        "Josh: No messages. Marah, it's your dad. Remember me? Handsome guy, misses you, beard. I hope you're out somewhere having a fantastic time. Call me when you get a chance, okay? Bye. Yeah, it's Josh Lewis. Is he there? What? Oh, no, I... sorry, I didn't realize the time. Yeah, working late. That's me. Work, work, work. Work, work, work. I'll tell you what, I'll fax it in the morning. Thank you. Yeah, bye. God it's strange how life can change in a moment... (phone ringing) God it's strange how life can change in a moment...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Hey. Were you watching? I did it. I set Joshua free. I let him go. And I gave Cassie a good push in his direction. I wish I could say that doing the most selfless thing in my life felt good, or that I wasn't furious at you for making me want to do this, but I just... I hope that they have an incredible life, both of them. And, hey, I could use whatever help you want to hand down here, too, you know. I mean, I think you owe me one. ...What I was about to say.",

        "Frank: I'll tell you what you're going to do. You're going to sit right now and work this out, and then you're going to let me know what you want to do about Ava and Olivia, all right?",
        "Buzz: Thanks, Frank. I'm going to go see Emma.",
        "Coop: What, we're not going to talk about this then?",
        "Buzz: You do this, if you get a restraining order against Olivia.",
        "Coop: It doesn't have to be that way...",
        "Buzz: Whatever you do it, we're not a family.",
        "Coop: I'm not trying to say that. I don't want that, and neither does Ava. But how would you feel if that happened to...",

        "Olivia: I can't wait for you. I have to get back to the hospital. Emma, Emma, you shouldn't be in there. You shouldn't be in there. Not when she's still up and walking around. (Car revving) (tires screeching)",

        "Olivia: I don't care how many times she says she's sorry. She put you here. She's not going to come between us. Mommy will never let anyone come between us.",
