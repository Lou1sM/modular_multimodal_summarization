        "Jonathan: Hey. Sorry, I didn't see you there. I don't see Sandy anywhere. Wish I could have been there when you told him about the fact that we found his tomb a few towns away.",
        "Tammy: Um, actually, I haven't brought it up yet.",
        "Jonathan: Are you curious? I mean, Sandy Foster is dead and buried. Who's been sleeping in your bed?",
        "Tammy: I am not going to get into this right now. I have higher priorities. I'm going to spend some time with my new baby sister.",
        "Jonathan: New... what baby sister?",
        "Tammy: Dinah finally gave birth. My mom is so happy.",
        "Jonathan: Wait a second. That's impossible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: What's up with you? It's been several hours. It's been several hours since he's gone out for those sleeping pills. Oh, come on. Get a grip. Edmund needs you alive. But he has that baby now. And maybe Cassie's getting closer to him because of it. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! He's not going to get away with this. He's not going to get away with this. Michelle and Cassie are going to figure out what happened with the baby and they're going to come for me. They're going to come for me. I know they will. Somebody will come for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Hey, Marina, it's me. I really need to see you. Will you call me when you get this? Okay?",
        "Marina: Okay.",
        "Danny: Hey.",
        "Marina: Hey.",
        "Danny: How did you... what are you doing here?",
        "Marina: Somebody just told me that I need to be spending a lot more time with you. You know what? I agree. So, if you don't mind, I...",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Marina: What's this? Is this new?",
        "Danny: Yeah. Yeah. We planted it today. Do you like it? It's nice.",
        "Marina: We?",
        "Danny: Me and Michelle. Just as a memorial in memory of the baby.",
        "Marina: Gotcha. What is all this? You guys having a party and you didn't invite me?",
        "Danny: What? No. No. But that's why I was calling you. I want you to know what happened today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: How long have you been in town?",
        "Michelle: Not very long.",
        "Cassie: Then how could you know that Edmund had changed?",
        "Michelle: I just have to believe Edmund has changed.",
        "Cassie: Why... why would you say that? Hi there. Guess what? You're never going to believe this but you know, Hope... she smiled at Michelle.",
        "Michelle: I think she probably had a burp or two in there.",
        "Cassie: Oh, that's just the voice of reason.",
        "Michelle: Well, a mother always knows. Sorry about your accident.",
        "Michelle: Thank you. Hope is beautiful, Edmund. Your daughter is absolutely perfect. You guys are really blessed.",
        "Edmund: I am a very lucky man I'm well aware of that. So I don't mind a bit if Jeffrey spends some time with Cassie and the baby. Why don't we grab a cup of coffee go for a walk?",
        "Michelle: Actually I have to meet with Mel a little bit.",
        "Edmund: Well, I'll walk you over there. Enjoy. See you soon.",
        "Michelle: Edmund, do you mind slowing down?",
        "Edmund: I'm sorry. Wanted to get us some privacy so we can talk, or rather I could talk and you could listen. So listen. Stay away from Cassie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: So is this going to be one of those look me straight in the eye and tell me the bitter truth moments?",
        "Danny: No. No. This is... actually, it's a look you straight in the eye and tell you were right moment.",
        "Marina: I am?",
        "Danny: Uh-huh.",
        "Marina: That's great! What am I right about? Danny:( Laughs ) Michelle, she's.. she's having a lot of trouble accepting that her baby's dead and...",
        "Marina: That's why I was asking the questions.",
        "Danny: I know.",
        "Marina: Danny, I don't want to get in the way I just thought I could help her find some answers and she can move on.",
        "Danny: You were right. You were. I thought that would make things worse, but she really needs some closure, and that's what this was about. And I think she got some today, planting the rose bush and Robbie and I had a mini Bauer barbecue for her since she missed the big one. More importantly, Robbie got to spend some time with her and with both of his parents.",
        "Marina: I bet that brought up a lot of emotions and stuff.",
        "Danny: Not a lot. Some.",
        "Marina: Well, you wouldn't be human, Danny, if you didn't feel that. I mean, to grieve for the baby along with Michelle.",
        "Danny: What did I do to deserve you?",
        "Marina: Who says you deserve me. It's not nothing to do with you, Santos. The fact is, I'm crazy about you, and there is nothing you can do about it.",
        "Danny: Well, I'm crazy about you. We all need to move on. We need to let go of the past.",
        "Marina: All of us?",
        "Danny: All of us. We need to move in.",
        "Marina: Move what?",
        "Danny: You heard me. This has been a long time coming we are way overdue. You are moving in with me. Today. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: There's a baby?",
        "Tammy: That's what I said. Why do you sound so shocked?",
        "Jonathan: Maybe it's for the best you didn't have that baby. You're done being his incubator.",
        "Dinah: Edmund needs me to wear the pads still so we can torture Cassie together. It was a little girl.",
        "Tammy: Dinah gave birth early. Edmund was with her at the farmhouse. They didn't make it to the hospital.",
        "Jonathan: And Eddie was the only one there.",
        "Tammy: He delivered the baby by himself and when my mom showed up, he put the baby into her arms. How crazy is that?",
        "Jonathan: Insane. So what about Dinah, huh? Where is she now?",
        "Tammy: That's the weird part.",
        "Jonathan: What?",
        "Tammy: Well, after giving up Hope-- that's the baby-- I guess it was too much and she left.",
        "Jonathan: Dinah left the farmhouse?",
        "Tammy: The farmhouse, Springfield, the country for all I know. My mom didn't even get to say good-bye or thank you or anything.",
        "Jonathan: It was just Eddie and the baby?",
        "Tammy: Yup.",
        "Jonathan: Convenient.",
        "Tammy: What's that?",
        "Jonathan: Nothing. I want to go see this miracle child. What do you say we take a ride over the farmhouse, have a peek.",
        "Tammy: I don't know. You know, you're not my mom's favorite person-- or Edmund's.",
        "Jonathan: Well, that's the point. I want to get through all that. I think maybe if I come see the baby, I can get in closer with the new mommy and daddy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Okay. Edmund... Edmund's not going to do anything, all right? He... he would not let me rot in here. He's not planning to do that. He wouldn't have built this place otherwise. Why not just let me... I don't know, be buried alive, suffer, strangle me to death.",
        "Ross: You know something, Sweetheart? You're asking some very good questions.",
        "Dinah: Daddy? Oh, my God, I really am losing it.",
        "Ross: No you're not. I think you're finally putting it together.",
        "Dinah: I am?",
        "_Ross: Think, Dinah. Edmund built this house, yes, but you were the one who turned it into a prison with that eternal voice in your head that says \"make Cassie suffer. Get back at Cassie.\" And every time you said that, it was another brick, one after another, until finally you finished the prison. And since you're the one who built this prison in your mind, it's only right that you should be the one to live in it. _",
        "Dinah: No. Daddy, please, just tell me that there's-- somehow I can change all this.",
        "Ross: Okay. Well, why waste my breath? You never do take my advice anyway.",
        "Dinah: Because I wanted to hurt you! I've wanted to make you pay somehow for not being there when I was growing up!",
        "Ross: That was your mother's fault. Vanessa never told me that you existed. but when I met you, I loved you and I always will, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: I know you love me. And I have wasted your time and I've made trouble for you and Mom, and I have plotted against Cassie and tried to ruin her life, but I have ruined mine. I know that. I did it to myself!",
        "Ross: There's hope for you yet.",
        "Dinah: Daddy, I will do anything. Please tell me how I can fix this.",
        "Edmund: He can't help you, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: Edmund?",
        "Edmund: Hello. It's me. Without the mustache this time. And I am your only salvation.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Edmund, I don't understand. Why would you want me to stay away from Cassie?",
        "Edmund: Well, I'm just thinking of you, Michelle. You and your loss. Why would you want to torture yourself to spend time with Cassie and the baby?",
        "Michelle: It's not torture, Edmund. I know it sounds strange but it actually helps in a way, holding on to a new life and looking into those eyes.",
        "Edmund: I know, I know. But you're holding on too tightly, and when you hold on tightly, you just prolong the pain. Michelle, I know. I know that Hope is precious and I know what you mean when you talk about holding her. But she's not your baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Hey. Oh, man, what Michelle's going through. I know how it feels to lose a baby, and it is the most horrible thing in the world. It makes you even afraid to try.",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, but you did. You tried, again.",
        "Cassie: I was terrified. What if something would have happened? I don't know what I'd do if I lost Hope.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Oh, Michelle, I wish you could trust me.",
        "Michelle: I do, Edmund. I do. You have been right about everything. If I had listened to you and stayed in your suite, then I wouldn't have driven in my car.",
        "Edmund: Don't, Michelle. Don't, please. Listen, you promised me you wouldn't speak this way. Look, the past is the past. And the sooner you can make peace with it, the sooner you can move on. And that's... that's what you want to do, isn't it? You want to move on? Good. Good. Then let me help you, Michelle. I want nothing more than to see you back on your feet. I want to see you back on your feet and starting a new life, all right?",
        "Cassie: Hi, so sorry to interrupt.",
        "Michelle: No, you're not at all. Actually I'm running to see Mel.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Well, we're going to get going because she's getting a little fussy.",
        "Edmund: Well, homeward bound it is, then. Mr. O'Neill, would you do me a favor and help them back to the farm and I'll meet you all there later?",
        "Cassie: Okay. Well, I'll see you, okay?",
        "Michelle: Yes. Thanks, Cassie. Thanks. Bye. Bye, little Hope. She really is very special.",
        "Cassie: Well, how about Edmund, huh? You know, sometimes he can be nice, right? Let's go.",
        "Edmund: I started self-medicating with some pills I had for a back injury. I took a few. I took a few more.",
        "Michelle: Um, yeah, I think Mel's shift is going to be over soon so she'll give me a ride home.",
        "Edmund: I don't mind waiting. You seem fine; I'm sure it won't take long.",
        "Michelle: Thank you, Edmund. You know, you've really turned out to be a good friend to me. I feel kind of like we have a connection, don't you?",
        "Edmund: You have no idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Let's get going.",
        "Marina: Danny, stop.",
        "Danny: What? Why? Why are you dragging your feet? You don't you want to move in with me anymore?",
        "Marina: Yes, yes I do, but listen to me. If you're just doing this because you feel for some reason like you have to...",
        "Danny: I do have to. I have to because I want to. Marina, I'm sick of being in limbo. I want to get on with my life.",
        "Marina: But Michelle...",
        "Danny: Hey, didn't somebody, some friend, give you some amazing advice? Something about spending lots of quality time with me? Quality, quantity time? Focused only on me.",
        "Marina: He wasn't a very good friend.",
        "Danny: Whatever. He was right. Let's start packing. Come on, and hurry up, we have a big night ahead of us.",
        "Marina: Oh, really?",
        "Danny: Yeah, really. Come on, go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Are you sure you don't want me to drive you home, Michelle?",
        "Michelle: I don't really know where that is, Edmund?",
        "Edmund: Well, I have a feeling that your father would welcome you and Robbie with open arms.",
        "Michelle: You know, I've been thinking about that a lot lately-- about working with my dad. He's in California now.",
        "Edmund: That would be hard, a move to California. But it might be harder, you know to stay here and watch Danny move on with his life. Watch him move on with Marina. I know it's hard for me to watch Cassie be with Jeffrey, to know they're happy together, to know that they're... well, sometimes I think it's just important to cut your losses.",
        "Michelle: And to know when to leave. And I think you're right. I am going to go inside and call the airlines.",
        "Edmund: As much as I don't want you to leave, Michelle, let me know when you are leaving because I'd like to see you off. I think it's important that a friend take you to the airport, put you on the plane, wave good- bye and wish you well.",
        "Michelle: Thank you.",
        "Edmund: Sure.",
        "Michelle: For everything.",
        "Edmund: Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Yeah, Hi. This is Danny Santos in Room 903. Yeah, I'm good. Thanks. Listen, I was wondering if I could order in something tonight and... well, can you whip up a really romantic diner? The most romantic thing you can come up with and put flowers in the room and candles, wine, the works. Yeah. Great. Great. This night has been a long time coming and I want it to be one that she remembers forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: You're my salvation?",
        "Edmund: Think, Dinah. What were you before you met me? Pathetic creature flitting about Europe pretending to be Princess Cassie. So desperate not to be discovered. So desperate to be something you clearly are not.",
        "Dinah: And what am I now?",
        "Edmund: Well, desperate still I grant you. But now you have your own identity. You are Dinah Marler, the woman who selflessly gave up her body to bear another woman's child. Saint Dinah, heaven's be praised who made her sacrifice willingly.",
        "Dinah: Michelle is the one who gave up her baby.",
        "Edmund: But no one's ever going to know that, no one, ever. And for that, I will always love you.",
        "Ross: Oh, for heaven's sake, don't listen to him. He's the one that got you into this mess in the first place.",
        "Edmund: Ross, it's time for you to step up to the plate. It's time for you to take responsibility, because thanks to you, invisible Daddy, your daughter is willing to pay any price for a man.",
        "Ross: Oh, you took full advantage of that, didn't you?",
        "Dinah: Stop it, you two. Just stop! I don't want to hear anymore. There has to be someone who could have helped me avoid all of this in my life. Wasn't there anyone?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I did my best, Dinah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: We have to give Edmund some credit. We now get to have some time alone together.",
        "Jeffrey: Edmund, yes. Well, you see, Edmund was avoiding.",
        "Cassie: Avoiding what?",
        "Jeffrey: Well... ( Cell phone rings ) Hang on, sorry. I have to take this, it's my new assistant. O'Neill. Do I know him? He's only the most important witness we could possibly have for the case, yes. But we need a statement. You're kidding me? Of course I'll meet with him. When? Okay. Well, let's make it a public place. How about Company? Got it. On my way. Cassie?",
        "Cassie: Yeah?",
        "Jeffrey: Got a break in the case. I'm sorry, I hate to run but...",
        "Cassie: Got to go, huh? Well, I guess you have a job. I can't expect to have you all the time okay, well, you know, we're here wait for you wherever you're ready.",
        "Jeffrey: Listen, about Edmund... you know what? If he says or does anything that upsets you at all...",
        "Cassie: Like what?",
        "Jeffrey: I'm going to let him tell you. I'm going to let Edmund tell you. I'll be back.",
        "Cassie: That's not fair. Oh, well.",
        "Tammy: Hey, Mom.",
        "Cassie: Here's your big sister.",
        "Tammy: Hi, cutie.",
        "Cassie: Sweetie, it's so good to see you.",
        "Tammy: Listen, I hope it's okay.",
        "Cassie: Hope what's okay?",
        "Jonathan: She hopes it's okay that I stop by to say hi.",
        "Cassie: Hello, Jonathan. Why is he here?",
        "Tammy: He just wanted to see Hope.",
        "Jonathan: I love kids. Is this her? Hi!",
        "Cassie: Don't think about touching her because I'm you haven't washed your hands. And I'm not kidding.",
        "Jonathan: Touch.",
        "Tammy: Isn't she something?",
        "Jonathan: Oh, yeah. She's a little baby. She's a baby. She's amazing. Every birth is a miracle only this one being here is really incredible!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: You know what? Do you have champagne? Great, let's do champagne instead of the wine and, um, do you have roses? A dozen roses.",
        "Michelle: White.",
        "Danny: Actually, no, I'm sorry, make it two dozen. Do you have red rose? Great, make them all red. And we should be there in an hour at the most. Okay, thank you so much. Thanks, bye.",
        "Marina: All right. I am ready to go make the first trip when you are.",
        "Danny: That's it? Are you serious?",
        "Marina: It's my important stuff.",
        "Danny: This is your important stuff? Your stuffed animals?",
        "Marina: Hey, listen to you, these guys have gotten me through some really tough times before there ever was a Danny Santos, okay? You don't think that I could really just leave them behind and move in with you. Come on, look at him. You made him sad.",
        "Danny: I made him sad?",
        "Marina: Tell him you're sorry.",
        "Danny: I'm not going to tell him I'm sorry. As long as they don't shed they can come. And as long as they stay off the bed. I don't want to wake up in the middle of the night holding a stuff elephant.",
        "Marina: What would you rather end up holding?",
        "Danny: Put down your little zoo and I'll show you.",
        "Marina: There's no time for this. Come help me.",
        "Danny: All right, I well. Good. They sooner we get out of here, the sooner we can lock that door behind us. Hey, Michelle?",
        "Michelle: Hi.",
        "Danny: Hey, what are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: You wanted to help me?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I gave it my best shot. I scraped you off of that prison floor out of the goodness of my heart.",
        "Dinah: You don't have a heart.",
        "Jeffrey: Dinah, how can you that about me?",
        "Dinah: Like this: Heartless.",
        "Jeffrey: You loved every minute of it, playing princess.",
        "Dinah: You loved pretending to be my decent husband.",
        "_Edmund: When it comes to lies O 'Neill, you have got me beat. _",
        "Dinah: Should tell Cassie everything about your little charade the minute I get out of here.",
        "Jeffrey: The minute you what?",
        "Dinah: The minute I get out of here. The minute I get out of here, stop laughing. ( All laughing ) You, too, stop laughing at me, Edmund! Daddy, tell him to stop laughing at me! ( All laughing )",
        "_Ross: I can 't. ( Laughing ) _",
        "Dinah: Stop it! All of you stop laughing at me and get out, you get out! All of you have done nothing for me. You haven't done a damn thing for me. ( All laughing )",
        "Dinah: None of you! You need to see the real me. I need someone who can see me, who's going to be there for me. Oh, my God, who am I kidding? Who am I kidding? There are no heroes that are going to save me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Somebody call for a good guy? It really is unbelievable how this little one came to be here. You know, I got pretty close with Dinah, you know, when you get close like that you pick up on some things. There is a lot that you don't know.",
        "Cassie: Really.",
        "Jonathan: Uh-huh.",
        "Edmund: Jonathan?",
        "Jonathan: Uncle Eddie, take a seat. We were just talking about miracles.",
        "Edmund: What's he doing here?",
        "Tammy: He just wanted to meet the new baby.",
        "Edmund: Good, you've seen her get out.",
        "Cassie: You were saying something. Something about Dinah teaching you something and the baby being here, being amazing.",
        "Edmund: Let's step outside.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, yes, the baby being here is amazing. But I don't think I have to tell you that, do I? ( Baby cries ) I mean, you know as well...",
        "Cassie: Hey. It's okay.",
        "Tammy: She just sees you, and that's all it takes. ( Laughter ) Okay, go ahead. What were you saying?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, don't you think Hope would be more comfortable upstairs?",
        "Jonathan: I was just saying it was a miracle Dinah came through with her part of the bargain. I just wish she was here so that I could congratulate her, too, you know, for her sacrifice.",
        "Cassie: Well, you know what, Jonathan? I wish she were here, too. She did so much for us.",
        "Jonathan: I think she deserves to be here. Don't you agree, Uncle Eddie?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: So how are you feeling? Did Mel check you out at the hospital? What did she say?",
        "Michelle: Clean bill of health, where's Robbie.",
        "Danny: Good. Well, he's at your house with Rick and Jude. He's waiting to see you. ( Cell phone rings ) Sorry, this is that contractor. I'll be back. Yeah?",
        "Marina: Hey, so you're feeling better?",

        "Marina: Why don't you just wait? He'll be back in just a sec.",
        "Michelle: It's okay. I just need to get some air and I need time alone. Thanks.",
        "Marina: Sure.",
        "Danny: Thanks. What happened? Why'd she go?",

        "Danny: Well, it's not that I needed to talk to her, but it's just... did she seem okay?",
        "Marina: I guess?",
        "Danny: Well, I guess she's headed over to the house to be with Robbie, which is good. They need to spend time together and we have plans.",

        "Dinah: You're just going to leave me?",

        "Tammy: From the catalog?",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Edmund: Jonathan, Cassie thinks it would be a good idea for the two of us to take a few moments alone.",
        "Cassie: So he can apologize.",
        "Edmund: Yes, exactly. I have a box of Havana cigars here given to me by a friend of mine at the embassy. I thought we could share a smoke, toast Hope's future.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, that's a good idea. I've been waiting a long time to fire up one of those puppies.",
        "Edmund: Good, then let's step outside. We don't want the pollute the air for my miracle daughter.",
        "Jonathan: I'll say good-bye before I leave, okay?",

        "Jonathan: So what's the deal with these, Uncle Eddie, they going to explode on me or something?",
        "Edmund: If you wanted to blow you up, I wouldn't use a cigar.",
        "Jonathan: And if I wanted to blow your world up, I would have all the ammo I already need. For instance, I know that Dinah wasn't pregnant, which means I know you didn't deliver any baby. So where'd you get that kid in there?",

        "Marina: Neither do I. But Danny, I don't... I just don't want to flaunt it, you know, what we are and what we have.",
        "Danny: Flaunt it?",
        "Marina: Not in front of Michelle. Not at a time like this. It doesn't feel right to me and I think that deep down you feel the same way. I mean, we don't have to prove anything to each other. We know what we have and what we are. And I believe in that. And in us.",

        "Jeffrey: Exactly. And it looks like I'm going to be working all night. So I'm sorry.",
