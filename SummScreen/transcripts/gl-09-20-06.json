The man arrives and Olivia tells him that she wants Ava to go away. Buzz finds Olivia and tells her that Emma is now awake. Emma tells her mother that her sister was there with her while she slept. Olivia tells her she only has one sister, Lizzie, and Emma tells her no, not Lizzie and her sister has brown hair. Olivia remembers her mother's funeral when she went into labor.

Later, after Emma is released from Cedars, she takes Emma to San Cristobel. Coop tells Ava that Emma is now awake and that they need to report Olivia. Ava is sad that Emma might not have a mother like her for her own mother died when she was young. Coop asks to see a picture of her mother. In San Cristobel, Oliva finds the contact Jeffrey gave to her and is given a folder regarding her delivery and the adoption. She sees a picture of a young, blonde woman named, Constance Sutton.

        "Olivia: I can't wait for you. I have to get back to the hospital. Emma... Emma, you shouldn't be there. You shouldn't be in there. But she's still up and walking around.",
        "[Olivia remembering]",
        "Olivia: What have you done to my baby? You wanted to hurt my little girl. If anything happens to my daughter, I will make you pay.",
        "(Car engine revs)",
        "(car engine screeches)",
        "Frank: Olivia, Olivia, what happened? Ava. Ava. Are you okay? (Screaming in background) Ava, take this. Take this. Put it around your arm. Hold it tight. It will stop... it will control the bleeding, okay? Olivia, Olivia. What happened? Come here. What happened? Are you hurt?",
        "Olivia: I... I... Ava...",
        "Frank: Olivia.",
        "Olivia: She was going do drive me home and I slid in the driver's seat so I could start the car and listen to the radio while she... and I... my arm must have hit the gear shift, and it happened so fast. Oh, thank God you're all right.",
        "Frank: Ava, I want to take you to the hospital just to be safe, okay?",
        "Ava: I'm fine. I just had the wind knocked out of me. I'm fine.",
        "Frank: No, I should take you to the hospital and I should take you home.",
        "Olivia: No, I have to go to the hospital. Emma's...",
        "Frank: No, Emma needs you to be okay and to take care of yourself, okay? You need to get home. My car is one level down. I'm going to get it. I'm going to drive it around. You stay put.",
        "Ava: You crazy, lying bitch.",
        "Olivia: It was an accident.",
        "Ava: An accident? Like what, like the balcony? You tried to run me down.",
        "Olivia: No, no, it happened so fast. And I haven't slept.",
        "Ava: You know what? That might work with Frank. You knew exactly what you were doing.",
        "Olivia: No, you're wrong.",
        "Ava: I'm not wrong. Shut up, okay? You looked at me in the face and you put the pedal down and you gunned it.",
        "Olivia: So, what are you going to do if Frank comes back? Are you going to tell him it didn't happen like it did?",
        "Ava: You're scared. Good.",
        "Olivia: This talk...",
        "Ava: I am done talking to you. And just so you know, I I'm not going to tell Frank what happened. Yet.",
        "Olivia: What does that mean?",
        "Ava: I'm not a cold, heartless bitch like you. Your daughter's in a coma. As soon as Emma wakes up, I'm telling everybody what you did.",
        "Frank: I still think you should go home. Come on, why don't you let me drive you?",
        "Olivia: No, I want to be here for Emma.",
        "Frank: When Ava left, did she say if she was going home? Because she's the one that really needs a doctor right now. (Cell phone rings) Sorry. It's the station.",
        "Olivia: It's okay. Frank, go.",
        "Frank: I saw dad's car in the parking lot.",
        "Olivia: I'll find him. Thank you.",
        "Frank: Okay.",
        "Ava: As soon as Emma wakes up, I'm telling everybody what you did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Oh, God. You're back. What's... what's wrong?",
        "Olivia: I think everything's catching up with me-- not eating, not sleeping, and I'm sorry that I left you before.",
        "Buzz: Where did you go?",
        "Olivia: I just walked. I just needed to walk. And I can't believe I left Emma. I'm such a terrible mother.",
        "Buzz: Oh, no, come on. You're a great mother. And you had me here. There's no change. But she's a strong little girl.",
        "Olivia: I was supposed to protect her, Buzz.",
        "Buzz: It was an accident.",
        "Olivia: It was an accident.",
        "Ava: An accident like what, like the balcony? You tried to run me down.",
        "Olivia: No, no, it happened so fast, and I haven't slept.",
        "Ava: All right, then, you know what? That act might work with Frank. You knew exactly what you were doing. You wanted me dead.",
        "Olivia: I'm sorry, I'm just jumpy. I just want to go see Emma. She shouldn't be alone.",
        "Buzz: The nurse is in there.",
        "Olivia: I know. I just want to spend some time with her, just a few minutes.",
        "Buzz: I'll get some snacks. I'll be right outside, and you can meet me.",
        "Olivia: Okay. Thank you. Hey, mommy's here, sweetie. I know you're in there just wanting to come back to me, right? I never should have left you, baby, and I never would have... and I know that it was wrong, I just... here you are and there she was. And I just couldn't think very well. She doesn't know what it's like to be a mother. I don't care how many times she says she's sorry. She put you here. She keeps saying it's an accident, but there are no accidents, Em. I know. You just worry about getting better, okay? She's not going to come between us. Mommy will never let anyone come between us. I promise. I need to see you. Someone is out to hurt me and I need her stopped. I need her stopped right now.",
        "Buzz: Olivia, I got...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Are you sure you're okay?",
        "Ava: Yeah. I'm just a little tired.",
        "Coop: I don't know. You're looking a little off right now. I think you're a little out of it. Hey, whoa, Ava, what...",
        "Ava: What?",
        "Coop: What happened?",
        "Ava: Oh. Yeah. I promised I wouldn't get in any more street fights, right?",
        "Coop: Here. Look, I'm being serious here. What is that?",
        "Ava: Oh, I don't know. I must have clunked it on the side of the countertop or something. You know how clumsy I am.",
        "Coop: What the... wait a second. What is this?",
        "Ava: What?",
        "Coop: How badly did you piss that countertop off? Ava, what the hell happened to you?",
        "Ava: I don't know. I fell in the garage, actually, after you left. It's the first time I've noticed these scratches. It's funny, I don't even really hurt when I'm around you.",
        "Coop: Okay. Look, are you going to tell me what happened here, or what...",
        "Ava: Why don't you just drop it?",
        "Coop: Just drop?",
        "Ava: Is there a first aid kit around here somewhere?",
        "Coop: It was Olivia, wasn't it?",
        "Ava: No. You know what? I just need a couple of band aids.",
        "Coop: Ava, what did she do to you?",
        "Ava: Nothing. Okay?",
        "Coop: Fine. You know what? If you're not going to tell me, I'm going to find out for myself.",
        "Ava: No, no. No, no. Okay? I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to freak out about it.",
        "Coop: Uh-huh. Okay. So she did do something. Ava, you've got to tell me what she did. What is all this?",
        "Ava: Stop it. She came by here earlier when I was looking for you and she was wrecked. She was completely drunk. And I offered to drive her home and my skirt got caught, and before I realized it she was in the driver's seat.",
        "Coop: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're telling me that Olivia tried to run you over.",
        "Ava: She didn't get me. Coop:, Ava, are you okay?",
        "Ava: Yeah. Frank showed up. I'm fine.",
        "Coop: And he arrested Olivia on the spot, right?",
        "Ava: I didn't really tell him exactly what happened.",
        "Coop: Ava, the chief of police shows up at the scene of a crime and you don't tell him what's going on?",
        "Ava: Coop, it wasn't the right time. Okay? Olivia was confused. She was drunk.",
        "Coop: Please tell me that you called her out.",
        "Ava: It wasn't the right time.",
        "Coop: Ava, oh, my... this... how many times does this woman have to try and kill you before you take action?",
        "Ava: She's 0 for 3. I mean, I'm not worried.",
        "Coop: That is not a funny joke.",
        "Ava: Laugh.",
        "Coop: That is not a funny joke. That is not a funny joke, Ava.",
        "Ava: Of course I know that it's not funny, okay? I know that.",
        "Coop: You've got to say something.",
        "Ava: (Sighs in aggravation)",
        "Coop: You've got to say something, Ava, that's all I'm saying.",
        "Ava: Okay. I will. You know, when Emma is better, I will.",
        "Coop: Ava...",
        "Ava: Okay, the time is not right here. Emma is sick, she's in the hospital and it's my fault. They do all of these studies about little girls and then people who are in comas and they can hear things and apparently feel things even when they're sleeping. Little Emma needs to know that her mom is there. That's the most important thing right now.",
        "Coop: Look, I know it's important, all right?",
        "Ava: But you're not going to change my mind! Okay? You're not going to change my mind. I just want her to get better, and she needs her to be there for her right now, and that's it.",
        "Coop: Just... you can't not do something.",
        "Ava: I know. I know. As soon as Emma's better, Olivia's going down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Not here. Thanks for meeting me so quickly.",
        "Gillespie: You paid promptly for services rendered once before. I remember those things.",
        "Olivia: Are you as discreet now as you were then?",
        "Gillespie: Of course. So what is it this time, more union problems at your hotel?",
        "Olivia: No, this is personal. You saw that girl at the cafe on Main Street?",
        "Gillespie: The one you were watching. She's the target?",
        "Olivia: She seems harmless, but she put my kid in the hospital. And now she's coming after me.",
        "Gillespie: Does this job have a name?",
        "Olivia: Ava Peralta. Just make her go away.",
        "Gillespie: You'll have to be more specific. You know how a stereo dial works?",
        "Olivia: What?",
        "Gillespie: The knobs on a stereo-- the volume, the bass. You can turn it down to zero, but sometimes you got to crank it up to ten to really hear it.",
        "Olivia: What was the union job?",
        "Gillespie: About a four. No one had to see the inside of one of these.",
        "Olivia: That was only a four?",
        "Gillespie: You're playing Ava's song, Ms. Spencer. You say you want her gone.",
        "Olivia: Badly.",
        "Gillespie: Then tell me how loud you want it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: She's awake.",
        "Olivia: What?",
        "Buzz: She's awake. Emma's awake.",
        "Olivia: Emma's awake? My baby's awake?",
        "Buzz: Yes.",
        "Olivia: Look at you! Look at you. Look at those beautiful eyes. I haven't seen those in so long. How are you feeling baby, huh? You're in a hospital, sweetie. But you know something? Everything is going to be okay. Everything is going to be okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Excuse me. Hi, look, I'm Henry. This is Ava. She needs medical attention.",
        "Buzz: I'll find Dr. Waller.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Okay, thanks. All right, sweetie. We're going to go home very soon. Is that okay? But first we have to wait. We have to stay right here because you drank so much perfume, Emma. Can't do that, baby it's bad for you. It's like poison. So you had to go to sleep for a long time so your body would feel better. Like sleeping beauty. Sleeping beauty, right? I missed you, baby. I was so worried about you. But the important thing is that you're awake and we're going to go home together, just us, right? You weren't afraid when you were sleeping, were you? I mean, you felt me out here with you. You didn't feel alone, right, sweetie?",
        "Emma: My sister.",
        "Olivia: (Laughs) Your sister? Your sister, inside there. You had a dream about Lizzie?",
        "Emma: Not Lizzie.",
        "Olivia: My baby. This is your only sister, Em.",
        "Emma: She has brown hair.",
        "Olivia: Did she have a name? Did she say anything else in your dream?",
        "Dr. Waller: Well, look who's awake, the cutest little lady in the whole hospital. Hi, Emma, I'm Dr. Waller. I'll need the room for the exam.",
        "Olivia: Can't I stay... okay. You stay here, all right? Buzz and I are going to be right outside. You listen to the doctor. (Laughter) What?",
        "Buzz: What? You're so beautiful. It's a beautiful thing to see you two together. Just some... you two together are something else. So, how is she? I mean, what were you two gabbing about. A dream? What was it?",
        "Olivia: Dream, tonight's dream come true.",
        "Buzz: Well, it's just the start of good things to come. You can count on it.",
        "Ava: As soon as Emma wakes up, I'm telling everybody what you did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Lizzie. Hi.",
        "Lizzie: Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.",
        "Coop: No, you didn't. That's fine. What's going on?",
        "Lizzie: Nothing. I forget my vitamins, so my grandmother left them for me at the desk. I saw you get in the elevator. You looked kind of upset. I thought I should check on you.",
        "Coop: Thanks. I'm okay. I'm just waiting for Ava.",
        "Lizzie: Is she sick?",
        "Coop: Do you care?",
        "Lizzie: Not so much. I was just trying to be polite.",
        "Coop: Olivia tried to run her down tonight.",
        "Lizzie: Wow. On purpose?",
        "Coop: I really don't think anything is just an accident with Olivia.",
        "Lizzie: Wow. Interesting. Look, I think that she's just been really freaked out since my sister drank that perfume.",
        "Coop: Well, look at you. You're siding with Olivia?",
        "Lizzie: Not really. It's just... I would go crazy if anything happened to my baby.",
        "Coop: Yeah. What about you? How are you feeling. Is the baby okay?",
        "Lizzie: She's great.",
        "Coop: Good. Jonathan, is he taking care of you?",
        "Lizzie: You would be surprised. He's actually been terrific.",
        "Coop: Good. That's good. Look, I better get back to Ava, you know?",
        "Lizzie: She's lucky to have you.",
        "Coop: Well she didn't exactly have a big gang of family like you or I do. She didn't have anyone. Anyway, look, I better go. Okay? Take care, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Tell Ava I said hi. Or don't. Hey. For once we can't blame Olivia, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: What is taking him so long?",
        "Buzz: The doctor is just doing his job, he's covering all the bases. What are you so nervous about? She woke up. She's come out of it. She's going to be okay.",
        "Olivia: I'm not going to relax until she's out of here.",
        "Buzz: Well, I guess I can understand. I mean, I'm a dad. Frank, about a month ago... wait a second. I haven't told Frank, I haven't told Coop, I haven't told Ava. She's been beating herself up...",
        "Olivia: No. No calls, please.",
        "Buzz: No what?",
        "Olivia: Buzz...",
        "Buzz: You don't have to talk to her. I'll tell her.",
        "Olivia: No.",
        "Buzz: Look, she deserves to hear about it. She blames herself for it.",
        "Olivia: It was her fault! I'm sorry. I know you feel for her and I understand you want to share the good news. I'm just... I'm superstitious about these things. I don't want to speak too soon.",
        "Buzz: Emma's going to be just fine.",
        "Olivia: And I believe you. But until Dr. Waller comes out here and gives us the okay, I don't feel comfortable telling anyone.",
        "Buzz: Okay. You're the boss. We'll wait.",
        "Dr. Waller: Everything looks good. Come on in.",
        "Olivia: She's...",
        "Dr. Waller: She's just sleeping, Ms. Spencer, and if my preliminary examinations are any indication, you may be able to take Emma home as early as tomorrow.",
        "Olivia: Tomorrow?",
        "Dr. Waller: One more night for precaution. Mr. Cooper, I trust you'll make sure that Ms. Spencer gets some rest.",
        "Olivia: Oh, no, no, no. I'm going to stay here. I want to be here when she wakes up.",
        "Buzz: No, no. I'm going to take you home. I'll take good care of her, okay? I'll be outside.",
        "Olivia: Okay. Good night, baby girl. Sweet dreams.",
        "Emma: My sister. Not Lizzie. My sister.",
        "Minister: Above all, she was a wonderful mother. She leaves behind three children, Marissa, Olivia and Sam. I'm never met a woman who loved her children more. It wasn't easy to raise them on her own, but she always put them first.",
        "Young Olivia: You did, Mama. You always put me first. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry I did this to you. (Screaming)",
        "Dr. Eldridge: You can do this.",
        "Young Olivia: No, I can't.",
        "Dr. Eldridge: Just one more push. (Screaming) It's a girl.",
        "Young Olivia: It's a girl? I have a daughter?",
        "Dr. Eldridge: Do you want to hold her, Olivia?",
        "Young Olivia: No, I don't.",
        "Emma: She has brown hair. Are you sure?",
        "Young Olivia: I already signed the papers, to please, I just want to get this other with. I never want to see that baby again. (Baby crying) Go! Go! Good- bye, baby. Good-bye forever. Not forever. Not forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Lizzie. Hi.",
        "Lizzie: Hey, how's Emma?",
        "Olivia: She's great, actually. She woke up last night.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, thank God. I was really worried about her.",
        "Olivia: I know. I want to thank you for the flowers and the present.",
        "Lizzie: No, I mean, anything for her. I heard about the car thing with Ava.",
        "Olivia: (Sighs) I've got to go.",
        "Lizzie: No, wait. I know that I don't know what happened, but I can tell you that if I were you and she hurt my little girl, I would have run her down without thinking twice. I would do anything to protect my baby.",
        "Olivia: Good.",
        "Lizzie: People like Ava, they don't get what it means to have to protect someone. All she does is bat her eyes and everyone comes running to protect her.",
        "Olivia: You've noticed that, too?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. You know, she acts so innocent. She's done nothing but cause trouble since she's come to this town.",
        "Olivia: I know. I can't believe we're agreeing on something.",
        "Lizzie: (Laughs) Well, I guess I... I understand things differently now.",
        "Olivia: I really have to get to the hospital.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. Tell Emma I'll stop by to see her tomorrow.",
        "Olivia: I will. Take care of yourself and that baby.",
        "Lizzie: Okay.",
        "Nurse: She's just resting.",
        "Olivia: Did Dr. Waller say when I could take her home?",
        "Nurse: I think he still plans to release her today. Beautiful little girl. She's been a dream.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: A dream. I know... I know it's privileged information. I know I signed my rights away, but I have another little girl. Now she has rights, too. I don't understand it myself. I'm just asking for help. Hello? Hello? Hey, you. Hi.",
        "Jeffrey: Hi, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: I was actually looking for you. Your office said that you would be here.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh. How's Emma?",
        "Olivia: She's awake.",
        "Jeffrey: That's great. That's really great.",
        "Olivia: It is. Listen, I need you to hook me up with one of your contacts in San Cristobel.",
        "Jeffrey: What?",
        "Olivia: I thought I would slide that in right after the good news. What? Okay.",
        "Jeffrey: What makes you think I can deliver your contacts in San Cristobel? I'm done with that place.",
        "Olivia: Come on, Jeffrey, you must know somebody. I just need someone to help me dig up some information, that's all.",
        "Jeffrey: About what?",
        "Olivia: Something in my past, something from a long time ago.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you know what? I suggest you leave it there, okay? Put the past and that island behind you.",
        "Olivia: What is wrong with you?",
        "Jeffrey: Nothing. Don't you think with this Springfieldburns.com is kicking up enough of people peoples' unwanted pasts?",
        "Olivia: I want this part of my past. I just need some information, that's all. If you don't give me a name, that web site is going to be the least of your problems.",
        "Jeffrey: Are you threatening me?",
        "Olivia: No, I'm just saying that when you go to get your warning paper I promise you I will be there when you go for lunch. Pull up another chair...",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, okay. Here, I'll give you the number.",
        "Olivia: Could you write it out clear? None of that chicken scratch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Once the princess woke up, the good fairy broke the sleeping spell and the whole kingdom was awakened to a brand new day. And they all lived happily every after.",
        "Emma: The end.",
        "Olivia: (Laughs) So I guess sleeping beauty didn't have a sister after all, you know, like the one in your dream?",
        "Buzz: Whoa, look what I found in the hall?",
        "Olivia: You found all of that in the hall? How long did you expect Emma to be here? Look at that.",
        "Buzz: Well, I knew your mom brought your Mr. Bear over there, so I thought he might need some company.",
        "Olivia: Mister?",
        "Emma: She.",
        "Buzz: She? It isn't Mr. Bear? It's Mrs. Bear? Well, excuse me.",
        "Olivia: Keep up, Buzz.",
        "Buzz: Well, wait a second, let me introduce myself properly. Hello. Excuse me. This is bear. My name is Buzz Cooper, what is your name?",
        "Emma: Ava.",
        "Buzz: Ava? Well, here. This one would be, what do you think, Sally?",
        "Emma: Yes.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, I think Sally.",
        "Dr. Waller: Good news. Somebody's going home. Emma has passed all her tests. I'm signing her release form.",
        "Olivia: Wow! I can take her home?",
        "Dr. Waller: Just as soon as you pack up all of these stuffed animals.",
        "Buzz: Thank very much, Doctor.",
        "Olivia: Thank you for everything. Hey, you know what, Em? How about we celebrate? How about we go on a vacation? You know, someplace sunny, maybe a beach where we can make sand castles.",
        "Buzz: Well, that sounds good.",
        "Olivia: You know what? Why don't you tell all of your friends about it, and Buzz and I will be right back. Here, hold her.",
        "Buzz: Um, was it something I said?",
        "Olivia: No, listen, I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but I was kind of thinking that maybe this trip should be about Emma and me.",
        "Buzz: It was something I said?",
        "Olivia: No, no.",
        "Buzz: No, it was my fault. I thought it sounded so nice, I just invited myself along.",
        "Olivia: It's not that I don't want you there. I do. It's just...",
        "Buzz: What?",
        "Olivia: You've been there for me throughout all of this...",
        "Buzz: You don't have to...",
        "Olivia: ...Mean everything to me. No.",
        "Buzz: You don't have to explain yourself. Come on. I've got a daughter who misses her mother every day, and a granddaughter that misses the same thing. Little girls need their moms. Big girls, too. With time together you can still replace that, so you go have a great vacation with Emma. Lonely me, I'll stay here and be waiting here when you get home.",
        "Olivia: I knew you'd understand.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse: Take care of yourself now, Emma.",
        "Olivia: Thank you. Well, that was fast. What a big girl you are. You ready to go? Still thinking about that dream you had? Well, you know what?",
        "Emma: What?",
        "Olivia: I bet that you miss your dream sister. She made you feel safe, right? You wish she were real, coming with us on our big trip? You know something? If anyone loves you as much as your dream sister does, she's always right here. And right here. And right here and right here.",
        "Emma: And right here.",
        "Olivia: And she's never that far away, right?",
        "Emma: Nope.",
        "Olivia: Right.",
        "Emma: Never.",
        "Olivia: So let's get out of here. Let's go on vacation. Say bye-bye, hospital.",
        "Emma: Bye-bye, hospital.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Hey, babe.",
        "Ava: Hey. Okay, what's happening? What's going on?",
        "Coop: Do you remember what you told me yesterday about how you wanted to wait to turn in Olivia until after Emma got better?",
        "Ava: Yeah.",
        "Coop: Emma got better.",
        "Ava: You're kidding me? She's awake?",
        "Coop: She came out of the coma.",
        "Ava: She's okay?",
        "Coop: Absolutely.",
        "Ava: She's all right? Oh, my God.",
        "Coop: A couple of hours ago, yeah.",
        "Ava: God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Hey, you have a seat. Come here. I'm got a present. Oh, my goodness. It's a picture book of all the places we went to in San Cristobel today. Right? Look. Wait a minute. There it is. There's the pancake house that we ate all of those yummy pancakes at. And the beach. You like the beach, right?",
        "Emma: And the crab.",
        "Olivia: And the crab.",
        "Melanie: Ms. Spencer?",
        "Emma: I don't like that.",
        "Olivia: You know what, honey, you sit here. Mommy's going to be right over there. You don't move, okay? Look for some other pictures. Melanie? Jeffrey said that you could help me.",
        "Melanie: I could get in a lot of trouble for this.",
        "Olivia: This should ease your conscience. Do you have what I need?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Emma's home? That's just great and so fast. I'm so happy.",
        "Coop: Yeah, like I said, she came out of the coma last night. So we're only finding out about it now, though. Look, I know that you told me you wanted to wait to turn Olivia in until after Emma got better, but did you tell Olivia that?",
        "Ava: Yeah, well, I guess that explains why I didn't get a phone call.",
        "Coop: If you want, I can get Frank over here right now. No, no, no. Stop, stop, look. Stop. Ava, you've got to do this. You have to do this. That woman has tried to kill you more than once, I might remind you, and this last time with the car. She's nuts. Ava, she's absolutely nuts. We've got to get her locked up.",
        "Ava: Okay. Well, what's going to happen to Emma?",
        "Coop: I don't know. I guess they might take her...",
        "Ava: To what, foster care? The Spaulding's? Those are two pretty sucky alternatives, Coop.",
        "Coop: Because of what Olivia did. It's her fault.",
        "Ava: Emma shouldn't have to pay for that. I lost my mother young, and so did you. Is that something that you ever get over? That's what I'm talking about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Melanie: I have to put that back in the file drawer where it belongs.",
        "Olivia: Just wait. Right here. Adoptive parents, United States. Gregory and Constance Sutton.",
        "Melanie: There are pictures of the adoptive parents clipped to the back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: What was she like?",
        "Ava: My mom? I have a picture. Do you want to see?",
        "Coop: Yes, sure. Whoa, what is this?",
        "Ava: Fairy tales.",
        "Coop: Fairy tales.",
        "Ava: Yeah. My mom used to read to me.",
        "Coop: My mom used to read to me, too, that's right. I used to love \"Three Little Pigs.\" What was your favorite?",
        "Ava: \"Sleeping Beauty.\" Here she is.",
        "Coop: She's beautiful. She doesn't look like you, though.",
        "Ava: Thanks a lot.",
        "Coop: You know what I meant. I'm just saying... I mean, she's beautiful, you're beautiful, but I don't see any resemblance here.",
        "Ava: Yeah. I guess I really never noticed that. Man, I miss her. I love her, and I still do.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Dinah: I'm very glad that you're here because I've been wanting to touch those knives, you know? I've been wanting to kind of cut somebody up.",
        "Gus: You are a wreck, my friend. You are what is referred to as a liability.",
        "Dinah: I am done with A.C. Mallet, okay? And I didn't want to talk about him with you or anybody else ever again, capiche?",
        "Coop: I know you miss your mom. Ava, this is a decision you have to make yourself.",
        "Olivia: Connie Sutton, the one who adopted my baby. I wonder if she ever told her she was adopted. Did you adopt a baby 21 years ago in San Cristobel?",
        "Frank: She's not on vacation, Pop. She's on the run. And we need to bring her back fast."
