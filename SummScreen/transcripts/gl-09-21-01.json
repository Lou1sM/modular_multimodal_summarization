        "\r\nRichard: This had better be good. ",
        "\r\nAide: It's the press. They're flooding the phone lines, and some of them \r\nare here. ",
        "\r\nRichard: Right, okay. And I am fully prepared to meet with them, but I \r\nreally do need a moment alone with my family. ",
        "\r\nAide: Perhaps if you could take just one? ",
        "\r\nCassie: Maybe you should. ",
        "\r\nRichard: Are you up to it? ",
        "\r\nCassie: Sure. ",
        "\r\nRichard: All right. But tell them this has to be brief, and no foreign policy,\r\n\r\nwhatever you do. You know, we don't have to do this. We can postpone. ",
        "\r\nCassie: No. No, I don't want to postpone. ",
        "\r\nRichard: All right. Then I promise that I will keep it brief. ",
        "\r\nCassie: I know. I just... They're going to ask us questions about us, and \r\nabout our future and our family. And I'm not going to be able to tell them that\r\n\r\nI'm going to have your baby. I'll never be able to tell them that I'm going to\r\n\r\nbe carrying your child. ",

        "\r\nDanny: Now there's some secret organization that I am supposed to be so \r\nterrified of that I would pull a stunt as idiotic as what you're asking me to do\r\n\r\nin order to save myself from it? Forget it. I am not... No, I'm not getting \r\nmyself pulled back in. ",
        "\r\nCarlos: It's a small enough task, Danny. ",

        "\r\nDanny: That greedy. ",
        "\r\nCarlos: I don't need the business or the aggravation. ",
        "\r\nDanny: Mm-hmm. Then what are you doing here, Carlos, like some third-\r\nrate messenger, doing all the talking for some big boss of all the bosses? ",
        "\r\nCarlos: Exactly. ",
        "\r\nDanny: Oh. I don't do anything without a meeting. ",
        "\r\nCarlos: I'm sorry, but you're in no position to dictate terms. I suggest you \r\ndo what you're told. ",

        "\r\nCarlos: You're working security for Spaulding. You have passwords, \r\naccess codes. You can get financial data on every account that company has \r\nworldwide. You take a few dollars here, a few dollars there; it all adds up into\r\n\r\none nice, fat Swiss bank account. ",
        "\r\nDanny: Right. And then what? What? I just... I sit there in my office \r\nwaiting for Alan or Phillip Spaulding to figure it out? Because they would. \r\nOh, they would, eventually. ",
        "\r\nCarlos: No, you'd be long gone by then. ",

        "\r\nReva: Mama, is that you? I felt you watching me before, but you've never \r\nlet yourself be known. Is it because you think I need you now, is that it? \r\nBecause I'm at this crossroads, right? My babies aren't babies anymore. \r\nMarah's all grown up and doesn't need my help moving into her new dorm \r\nroom. And Shayne's not my little baby boy anymore, and Joshua... I think I've\r\n\r\njust about ruined his life for the last time. So I'm on my own for the first \r\ntime \r\nin a long time, and it feels important. The next step? You can go ahead and \r\nchime in here anytime you want, mama. Help me find the next step. ",
