        "Sandy: What do you... no, no, no. Where are you?",
        "Reva: (Gasps) what are you going to do? Butter me to death? (Knocking at door)",
        "Tammy: Who is it?",
        "Lizzie: It's me.",
        "Tammy: What?",
        "Lizzie: Whoa. You look terrible, tammy.",
        "Tammy: Thanks.",
        "Lizzie: And frightened.",
        "Tammy: Well, if crazy dinah was creeping around your property...",
        "Lizzie: Well, then security would have her face down on the grass in, like, 10.2 seconds. But, hey, since you don't have a security team, you must be pretty scared.",
        "Tammy: Well, as scared as i am of that whack job, lizzie, i still would have rather opened the door to her than you.",
        "Buzz: Thank you for not flashing the bat signal in the sky when I got out of the hospital. You know them. They'll make a big deal.",
        "Coop: Oops.",
        "Buzz: Oops? Oops what?",
        "Coop: Look, I didn't know you didn't want anyone to know that you had got... look, it's not really a big party. Not really. (Laughs) gotcha. No, no, no. Pops, we're cool. We're cool, really. Look, no one's going to come within a mile of us. And if they do, I've got something for them, I promise. I'm sorry.",
        "Buzz: Practical jokes on cardiac patients?",
        "Coop: (Sighs) look, at least I didn't throw you a real surprise party.",
        "Buzz: My heart thanks you. Thanks for the lift. I better get in, get a whiff of the grill, reacquaint myself with my old life.",
        "Coop: You're looking a bit shorthanded in there. Do you need some help?",
        "Buzz: No.",
        "Coop: Pops, you just got yourself out of the hospital. I mean...",
        "Buzz: No.",
        "Coop: You might have to lift...",
        "Buzz: No.",
        "Coop: I know. You love having me here. I just wish I would have come a little sooner. I'll be inside, pops.",
        "Buzz: God, jenna, he's beautiful. I knew this would happen. You knew, too, didn't you? You knew before me. (Knock at door)",
        "Alexandra: Well, your legs look just fine to me.",
        "Phillip: Sorry?",
        "Alexandra: Oh. Well, I just assumed that you might have been run over by a bus. They would have been crushed or maybe trampled by a couple of bulls at pamplona. Otherwise, surely you would have gotten here sooner to see me.",
        "Phillip: Sorry. I've been busy.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, really? Well, I haven't! I'm trying to do a lot of meditation, triple-speed. At least you had the good sense to run and flee from prosecution in the past.",
        "Phillip: Hey, you could have done the same thing.",
        "Alexandra: Yeah, well, i didn'T. You know what? It would be very nice to be commended for that action.",
        "Phillip: (Laughs) you'd like to be commended for doing the right thing? What am I talking about? Of course you would. Sure, that makes sense. (Laughs)",
        "Alexandra: Come here. Come closer to me. (Laughs) you look okay.",
        "Phillip: You didn't ask me over here to scold me for not seeing you sooner. You want to see if I've lost it again, don't you?",
        "Alexandra: (Laughs) let's cut to the chase. Have you?",
        "Phillip: (Laughs)",
        "Bill: Olivia, olivia. Don't you ever pick up your phone? Where are you?",
        "Harley (as ruth): Excuse me, handsome. Do you have change for the telephone?",
        "Bill: Will you stop doing that? That voice is freaky.",
        "Harley: Really? You want to see something freaky? (Screams)",
        "Bill: What is this? (Yells) ah, the nose. That is so gross.",
        "Harley: Is it?",
        "Bill: Yes.",
        "Harley: I swear, I look in the mirror, I don't know who I'm looking at. It's like I am looking at a face I don't even recognize.",
        "Gus: I know the feeling.",
        "Gus: How are you?",
        "Harley: Hanging in there.",
        "Gus: Your dad?",
        "Harley: He'll be discharged any day, just in time for the wrecking ball that spaulding is sending to take down his restaurant.",
        "Gus: Well, I'm working really hard at making sure that doesn't happen.",
        "Harley: Well, I hope you're not doing it for me. I hope you're doing it because it's the right thing to do.",
        "Gus: Yeah. No, I... (sighs) never mind. Tell your dad I said hi, all right? Bill.",
        "Bill: See you, gus. Wow, that wasn't awkward at all. How long are you going to grind that poor guy under your heel, huh?",
        "Harley: What is this?",
        "Bill: This? It's rock the vote. You registered?",
        "Harley: Of course I'm registered.",
        "Bill: Well, you better be. Get out there and vote.",
        "Harley: I will.",
        "Bill: Now, are you going to answer my question? How long are you going to make that poor guy suffer?",
        "Harley: You know what he did.",
        "Bill: Oh, come on, harley. So what.",
        "Harley: It's not \"so what,\" bill.",
        "Bill: No, seriously. Who else are you going to find to put up with you? I'm just saying sometimes, you know, you've got to lower your standards. That's all. That's all. That's all I'm saying. Two espressos, please.",
        "Harley: You're right. I should lower my standards. I should accept dishonesty. You are so smart, bill. Thanks for the advice.",
        "Bill: Trust me, I have a nose for these things. (Laughter) I'm serious. You're going to be spending a lot of time with the spauldings. You're going to have to deal with gus-- as ruth, yes, but nevertheless, you're going to have to deal with him.",
        "Harley: Let me tell you something. Don't worry about ruth. Ruth is a heartless killing machine.",
        "Bill: Yes, yes, she is. What about harley, huh? Isn't she all about love? I'm serious. It's obvious you two are both miserable. I just don't understand why.",
        "Harley: I have a mission here, just like you.",
        "Bill: And what is your mission all about, huh? Revenge?",
        "Harley: Oh, please. It's about taking back the power, and you know it. It's about showing phillip and the rest of the spauldings that they're not controlling the whole world. They're certainly not controlling mine.",
        "Bill: No. I'm not judging you. I get that. I like a big plate of power and a side of revenge, but, you know...",
        "Harley: You know what really stinks?",
        "Bill: Hm?",
        "Harley: Is that I used to think I had everything. I had these great kids, this guy I loved, this marriage in the making. Now look at me.",
        "Bill: I mean, don't you still want that stuff? A blissful life with the man of your dreams?",
        "Harley: (Laughs bitterly) it's never worked out for me before. I should take the hint, don't you think?",
        "Bill: You're asking the wrong guy. I gave up on all that stuff when eden went away. I'm done.",
        "Harley: Me, too.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, so I was on my way to register to vote. You saw that whole, like, rock the vote thing on the web site? The chicks rock, chicks vote? So, come on. Let's go rock, girl.",
        "Tammy: You want me to go with you?",
        "Lizzie: Yes.",
        "Tammy: Um, no.",
        "Lizzie: You know, tammy, i was really hoping we could get past this whole joey thing.",
        "Tammy: Hm. No, you know what? I don't think you're here to make up with me, and this has nothing to do with registering to vote. You just wanted to see how things were going with me and joey.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. You want me to be honest?",
        "Tammy: Yeah. I also want world peace and a carb-free hot fudge sundae, but it's really not looking too good on any one of those fronts.",
        "Lizzie: Good one. The only thing is, I would never lie about this, okay? It's about me and joey. He used to be yours, and now he's up for grabs.",
        "Tammy: Is that so?",
        "Lizzie: Yes. He is. And you want me to be honest? I love joey. Do I love him because you had him first? I really don't know. But I do know that he's been nicer to me than any guy has ever been.",
        "Tammy: Really? Well, what about all those boarding school guys you're always talking about?",
        "Lizzie: They weren't like joey. I'd do everything I could to get joey, even if it was for only one night, one incredible night of love. Joey and I will never forget it.",
        "Tammy: Well, that's funny, since joey told me he doesn't remember. That guy that you turned yourself inside out for? The guy that you destroyed friendships to get? He barely even knows that you exist. You're right, lizzie. It must be love.",
        "Reva: I know there are times I've made my kids crazy, but no one has ever tried to pull a knife on me. (Laughs) I think you owe me an explanation.",
        "Sandy: Just wanted to bring a little excitement to your life. Huh?",
        "Reva: Okay.",
        "Sandy: I was just joking. I knew it was you. And I'm glad to see you, too, because I've been thinking about a story we could do. It's the election, right?",
        "Reva: Yes.",
        "Sandy: And the youth vote could play a huge factor, right? So I was thinking we could do a feature on youth voter registration.",
        "Reva: Well, I think that's a great idea. Rock the vote, that whole thing, huh?",
        "Sandy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Reva: But before we get into that, are you sure you're okay? Because you just... you seem a little jumpy to me today.",
        "Sandy: I'm fine.",
        "Reva: I'm just worried about you. You know, suddenly you were going to leave town, and you wouldn't tell me why, and i can't help but think...",
        "Sandy: Reva, I'm not going anywhere. That's all you need to know. If you need me, I will be here.",
        "Coop: What is so wrong with me working for you for a little bit?",
        "Buzz: I don't need your help.",
        "Coop: What if I promise not to break any plates?",
        "Buzz: This place isn't you.",
        "Coop: How do you know that?",
        "Buzz: Look, you're doing this now. Next you'll be making burgers.",
        "Coop: Pop, you're not forcing me to do anything. I'm offering.",
        "Buzz: You've traveled the world. You've seen things that most of us just read about, so your next stop is short order cook?",
        "Coop: Look, I'm here because I want to help. Believe me, if I wanted to leave, you wouldn't be able to stop me. But look, am I leaving?",
        "Buzz: You don't want this.",
        "Coop: How do you know that?",
        "Buzz: Because you've never wanted to come here before.",
        "Phillip: You think I've gone off the deep end again?",
        "Alexandra: No, I would say it's more like overcompensating, because you are lashing out, phillip. I mean, yes, a lot of things have happened to you-- to us. One would have to be a little crazy not to be a little crazy.",
        "Phillip: Buzz been to see you?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, don'T... don't you even bring up the subject of buzz cooper, because i absolutely hate what you're doing to him. I hate it. And you know what? All I can do is sit behind these stupid bars and worry!",
        "Phillip: You're wasting your time worrying about him.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, so speaks a man who has been burned by a lifetime of worry. Hm.",
        "Phillip: Well, I'm not worrying now. A problem comes up, I take care of it. I have singular focus.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, well. What about compassion? What about love? You know? I know that alan tried to crush that out of you to make you tougher, but...",
        "Phillip: I loved deeply. What do I have to show for it?",
        "Alexandra: Your children, for starters. Do you know how lucky you are to have them?",
        "Phillip: I do. And you're right. I have my children, and that is where my love goes now. They are my family and my future, and if I continue to fight this fight, maybe all the things that I went through in my life will never be issues for them. Protect thine own, house of spaulding. That's something else that you and alan taught me. Remember?",
        "Alexandra: And did we obviously create a monster? Did we?",
        "Gus: What is this?",
        "Phillip: Did she call you? (Laughs) ah, yes. Well, brother, I think we've been had. Someone in this room thinks she's doing a good turn.",
        "Alexandra: Not really. Come on, just because I think i can heal a fault line, we're all going to be better off for it.",
        "Phillip: What fault line? We're a family. Gus just hasn't figured out yet what side he's on.",
        "Gus: Oh, I know what side I'm on. I'm on the good side. That only leaves one side for you.",
        "Coop: I see where this is going.",
        "Buzz: Classic story, really: Loving but emotionally deficit father sends son to live with well-meaning relatives. Breaks heart, but convinces himself it's the right thing to do. And sure enough, the son raises himself better without the father around.",
        "Coop: At least that's what the father tells himself year after year. Time passes, the son becomes a man, the father starts hearing stories about the son's life, his successes, his adventures.",
        "Buzz: And perhaps the father may live through the son-- the young part of the father.",
        "Coop: Pops, look, matter where I was in the world, I knew that you were right here in springfield holding down the fort, no matter where I was. I mean, my family was right here, a place that I could always come home to.",
        "Buzz: Well, why didn't you?",
        "Reva: Hi.",
        "Buzz: Hi. You know who this is. This is my son. This is coop.",
        "Reva: I was going to say. It is so incredible to see you. You are big. ( Laughter) you look great. Are you an american citizen?",
        "Coop: And proud of it.",
        "Reva: Have you registered to vote yet?",
        "Buzz: Where did that come from?",
        "Reva: No, no, I'm just saying, because, you know, sandy and I are working on the story about young people registering and getting them out to vote, and I was just wondering if you were a citizen and...",
        "Buzz: Well, I don't really need any help, but maybe you should register.",
        "Coop: Uh-uh-uh. A., You're not getting rid of me that easily. B., I still have time, right?",
        "Reva: You have until the end of the month.",
        "Coop: Perfect. Well, I guess I'll just go ahead and do that tomorrow. In the meantime, it was good to see you.",
        "Reva: You too, coop.",
        "Coop: I'm going to go ahead and get to work.",
        "Reva: He looks like jenna.",
        "Buzz: Thank god.",
        "Reva: (Laughs) so how's it going, dad?",
        "Buzz: Once again, I'm trying to figure out how to parent a kid I hardly know.",
        "Buzz: Welcome back to the club. We've missed having you.",
        "Harley: So what's the deal with you and olivia anyway?",
        "Bill: Just hanging out.",
        "Harley: Just hanging out.",
        "Bill: Hanging out.",
        "Harley: That's fine with the both of you?",
        "Bill: You know, we're not looking for anything too complicated.",
        "Harley: Yeah, me neither. I got my kids, my family. I've got ruth.",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm.",
        "Harley: What more could a girl want? (Phone rings)",
        "Bill: That's right.",
        "Harley: Right.",
        "Bill: Ruth is good.",
        "Harley: Hello? Yes, it is. What?",
        "Bill: Something wrong?",
        "Harley: It's zach.",
        "Gus: Aunt alex, I really appreciate you trying to broker this deal, okay, but him and I, we are oceans apart. It doesn't matter anyway, because I've accepted my role. Phil here, phil is the boss. (Phone rings)",
        "Phillip: Excuse me. Yes?",
        "Harley: It's me.",
        "Phillip: What do you want?",
        "Harley: Well, I want you to stop acting like a jerk for a second and act like a father. There's a problem with zach.",
        "Tammy: Coming up on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Buzz: What are we going to do about it? We're going to do something positive about it.",
        "Coop: Okay. Like?",
        "Buzz: We're going to kick phillip spaulding around the sandbox.",
        "Coop: Yeah.",
        "Phillip: I'll go as far i have to go. And if you ever try to come between me and my son... good-bye, harley. Oprah: Secret lives",
        "Buzz: My son is not cut out to be a waiter.",
        "Coop: I'm so not cut out to be a waiter. I'm just doing this to help my dad out.",
        "Sandy: No, no, no. Hey, I'm sorry about before. Wait. Buzz's son?",
        "Coop: Yep. Return of the prodigal.",
        "Sandy: I've been there. I came into reva's life about a year ago.",
        "Coop: Yeah? How's that going?",
        "Reva: Just peachy. He tried to run away the other day.",
        "Buzz: Why?",
        "Reva: I have no idea.",
        "Sandy: Yeah, this whole relationship, child/parent thing, is not something I'm used to.",
        "Coop: Sure. Me, neither. I mean, you've been here for a year though already. I mean, something must be going right for you.",
        "Sandy: Yeah, a lot is going right.",
        "Reva: I thought everything was great between us. But what do I know? Not my son-- not very well anyway.",
        "Buzz: Oh, I think you do better than you think.",
        "Coop: I barely even know my dad. I mean, he's great, and he visited me whenever he possibly could. But...",
        "Sandy: You're lucky.",
        "Coop: Why?",
        "Sandy: You have a great family.",
        "Coop: What are we supposed to do with them now? I mean, you know, we like them here, to have them here, but not to hang around us.",
        "Reva: I do.",
        "Buzz: The guilt, reva. The guilt, the guilt with this.",
        "Reva: Oh, I know.",
        "Sandy: How is the all- consuming parental guilt fest going?",
        "Coop: Well, buzz is over there right now flagellating himself with a spatula.",
        "Reva: Well, at least he's here.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, but for how long?",
        "Reva: Have you asked him to stay?",
        "Sandy: Has he asked you to stay?",
        "Coop: Well, I've been trying to convince him that I will, but it's almost as if he's scared to be around me.",
        "Sandy: That's because he's afraid of how crushed he might be if you took off. Sometimes it's better to not have had it in your life at all.",
        "Coop: Well, what about you? I mean, you've thought about bailing, right?",
        "Sandy: It's the coward's way out. You've got to stay and do the right thing, especially if you love your family and you want to keep them safe.",
        "Coop: Safe? Safe from what?",
        "Buzz: You know, when I was around their age, I ran away, and I didn't look back for a long time. If they want to go, you can't stop them.",
        "Reva: We can try.",
        "Tammy: Dry your eyes, lizard. There's no way I'm going to feel sorry for you.",
        "Lizzie: Well, tammy, how would you feel if you slept with a guy you loved, and he didn't even remember it?",
        "Tammy: I would have picked the wrong guy. Here's something to make you fell better, okay. I don't want joey, lizzie. Why would I after what he did? Why would you think he'd want to come back to me after he slept with you?",
        "Lizzie: Wow. Thank you for being honest. You know, I really hope that maybe we could be friends again one day. (Phone rings) oh. Hello?",
        "Jb: Hey, babe.",
        "Lizzie: Why are you calling me?",
        "Tammy: This isn't your personal office.",
        "Lizzie: But, tammy, I thought we could...",
        "Jb: Are you with tammy? Put her on.",
        "Lizzie: Do you have to be so rude?",
        "Tammy: I'm sure you're used to it.",
        "Jb: Let me talk to tammy.",
        "Lizzie: Who is this?",
        "Jb: You know who this is, rich girl.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, what I don't know is how you got this number. Now, since you're such a loser, why don't you just lose it?",
        "Jb: You better start being more nice to me. Come down to farley'S.",
        "Lizzie: Why?",
        "Jb: Trust me. It'll be worth your while.",
        "Phillip: Please sit.",
        "Harley: Miss mendez called because she's concerned about zach's behavior.",
        "Phillip: Okay. Well, what is the nature of your concern?",
        "Harley: Zach has been hitting.",
        "Phillip: All right. Well, that's not so unusual, is it? He's a boy. Boys sometimes hit.",
        "Ms. Mendez: It's the motivation behind these that concerns me.",
        "Phillip: These outbursts?",
        "Ms. Mendez: Mr. Spaulding, i know you both love zach very much. Despite your divorce, you and miss cooper have maintained a very workable family dynamic. That's why this recent behavior is so troubling. Is there any extra stress going on at home?",
        "Harley: You mean, like zach watching as his father tries to crush his mother and her entire family in front of his very eyes. Something like that?",
        "Lizzie: Okay, now tell me what I'm here for.",
        "Jb: Is that anyway to talk to your secret share buddy?",
        "Lizzie: We're not buddies.",
        "Jb: But we do share some secrets. Oh, actually it's just that i know all of your secrets.",
        "Lizzie: Are you threatening me?",
        "Jb: Threatening a spaulding? The richest, most powerful family in this town? That would be stupid.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. So, anyway, how much do you want?",
        "Jb: Seriously? I was just playing, lizzie. I thought you'd like to know that your friend tammy got drunk last night, and she was hanging out with tony santos.",
        "Lizzie: Do you think that he told her about...",
        "Jb: You saw tammy. Did she seem like she knew you asked tony for drugs?",
        "Lizzie: I guess not.",
        "Jb: All is well. Do you want a drink?",
        "Lizzie: No. Uh-uh.",
        "Jb: Sure you do, something sweet just like you, a little umbrella. Come on, let's go.",
        "Sandy: So you the kind of person who needs to take their mind off stuff?",
        "Reva: What are you talking about?",
        "Sandy: You know how people always say, do this or you do that, it'll take your mind off it. Whatever it may be.",
        "Reva: No, I like to live my life in the present, since i have the unfortunate distinction of having forgotten huge chunks of my life at one time or another. What are we talking about?",
        "Sandy: Work. Rock the vote is a great idea. You know, they're the main civic organization increasing youth participation in the election process.",
        "Reva: Wow. I am very interested. Can you show me the numbers?",
        "Sandy: Can I show you the numbers? Well, they have about 15,000 street teams nationwide. Remy has one right here in springfield. Now, the goal is to get 20 million of-age voters to the polls this election cycle. Now, a feature could promote awareness and target that demographic your advertisers love.",
        "Reva: You're really something, do you know that?",
        "Sandy: Oh, yeah.",
        "Reva: No, I'm serious, sandy. I mean, you have become very important to us-- me, especially. I mean, with everything that's going on with cassie, and joshua gone, and marah and shayne away...",
        "Sandy: Reva, you would have done just fine by yourself.",
        "Reva: Yeah, but I wouldn't have had half the fun. I mean, you make my day, every day. And if I died tomorrow...",
        "Sandy: Whoa, whoa. Don'T... don'T... don't say that.",
        "Reva: What? What? It's okay. Nothing is going to happen to me.",
        "Sandy: There's no reason to tempt fate. You've had enough bad luck in your life.",
        "Reva: It's an expression. If I died tomorrow...",
        "Sandy: No.",
        "Reva: Have we had more than our usual quota of bad, hateful e-mails or something?",
        "Sandy: Something like that.",
        "Buzz: I thought... I don't know why I thought this, but i thought that maybe being a waiter would be beneath your gentlemanly skills. But apparently it isn't, because you stink at it actually. What kind of cooper are you? I mean, frank, marina, harley: They're naturals at it. Your mother-- even your mother could find her way around the kitchen.",
        "Cooper: I possess other talents.",
        "Buzz: And stay out of my kitchen. No one puts that amount of paprika on anything.",
        "Coop: Well, I can make yaks butter. How about that?",
        "Buzz: Did you say yak?",
        "Coop: Yeah. I could make yaks butter.",
        "Buzz: Have you been around yaks a lot?",
        "Coop: No.",
        "Buzz: Have you ever milked a yak?",
        "Coop: I can squirt milk out of my nose. How about you?",
        "Buzz: What?",
        "Coop: Look, pops, all I'm saying is that you have been given a new lease on life. Just haven't you ever wanted to go out and just learn something-- something new, something different, something besides just running this restaurant?",
        "Buzz: It took me a long time to get back to the restaurant. Is that what this is about?",
        "Coop: What? Showing you the redeemed life on a golden path? Yeah. This is something that I learned in tibet.",
        "Buzz: You're a smart-aleck.",
        "Coop: Well, you know what? You're right. But you also know that I'm right about this.",
        "Buzz: You know, I almost died, and here I am, standing here, waiting to be embalmed, all the while being shoveled dirt on by phillip spaulding.",
        "Coop: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Time out there. You've got your dead guy metaphors mixed up. But I do know where you're going with this. So the next question is, what are we going to do about this?",
        "Buzz: What are we going to do about it? We're going to do something positive about it.",
        "Coop: Okay. Like?",
        "Buzz: We're going to kick phillip spaulding around the sandbox.",
        "Coop: Yeah! You know what? That's what I'm talking about. You want to know why I came back here?",
        "Buzz: Why?",
        "Coop: That right there.",
        "Phillip: It is true that our families are in the midst of some disagreement at the moment. But harley tends to be a little excitable. It runs in her family.",
        "Harley: And what runs in your family? The will toward ruin and destruction?",
        "Jb: After santos left, another dude came in and sat down with tam tam.",
        "Lizzie: So who was he?",
        "Jb: I don't know, but she left with him.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, so she like left, left? Or what? Do you not know what he looks like?",
        "Jb: Medium height, dark hair, piercing eyes. I don't know. I wasn't checking him out. I think she said his name was sandy.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, sandy. Well, that would be her cousin, you moron. You're wasting my time. So would you please just lose my number? (Phone rings) hello? This better be good.",
        "Joey: Hey, lizzie, it's me. Could you meet me at the beacon? There's something I need to tell you. It's the kind of thing I can only say face to face.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there. This is it!",
        "Phillip: Miss mendez, I don't want you to get the wrong impression about zach's home life. Harley is generally a very good mother, and we try to present a united front on these things, but at the moment we're having a difference of opinion about a number of things.",
        "Ms. Mendez: Well, these differences are taking their toll on zach. When I asked him about the hitting, he replied that it was okay to hit, that it was even okay to hate other people.",
        "Harley: He said that?",
        "Ms. Mendez: When I asked him why he thought it was okay, he responded that his daddy hated his mommy and his grandpa, so he was just being like his daddy.",
        "Phillip: Well, thank you for bringing this our attention. I assure you I will take care of it.",
        "Harley: We'll both speak with zach.",
        "Ms. Mendez: It will take both of you to remedy this situation before these feelings take root in zach.",
        "Harley: Thank you.",
        "Phillip: Thank you.",
        "Harley: I'll talk to him as soon as I get home.",
        "Phillip: Not before I do, you won'T. I think maybe that's been the problem all along, is you talking to zach-- maybe late at night before he goes to bed, telling him things.",
        "Harley: And what things would I be telling him, phillip?",
        "Phillip: About his father, what a monster I am.",
        "Harley: Hey, you back off right there. I have never said anything negative to our son about his father.",
        "Phillip: Yeah, I'm ju being paranoid.",
        "Harley: He's not blind, phillip. - He sees what you're doing to the - p ople that loves. \u00fa Maybe that's what's confusing him. Maybe that's why he's angry.",
        "Phillip: Oh, so this is my fault?",
        "Harley: This family is living under siege, and you're the one lobbing the shells into the foxhole, not even caring that your son is in there with the rest of the people that you hate.",
        "Phillip: Well, you know what? I won't have to worry about any of that if I take my son back where he belongs, will I?",
        "Harley: And where is that? With you?",
        "Phillip: Yeah, with me.",
        "Harley: You know, you act like none of this affects you, like it's just unfortunate business as usual. But underneath it all, you are barely hanging on.",
        "Phillip: No, on the contrary, harley, for the first time in a long while, I have a firm grip on things.",
        "Harley: Except that your family's falling apart. And if you keep this up, your children will turn on you, just like you turned on alan when he went too far.",
        "Phillip: Listen, I'll go as far as I have to go. And if you ever try to come between me and my son... good-bye, harley.",
        "Alexandra: I mean, you and harley were so deeply in love. There's got to be some way you can survive this.",
        "Gus: Didn't you once say that a spaulding can't ever survive true love-- not for long anyway? Wasn't that you? I think it was.",
        "Alexandra: Well, you can be the exception. Come on, you're different. I mean, grab on to that and go for it.",
        "Gus: I used to... I used to think I was a little bit different, but now I kind of feel like I'm clumped in with the rest of you.",
        "Alexandra: No, gus, you are different. You're never going to be like us. That is exactly why you and harley have a chance. Now, you want her back. If that's what you want, I will help you. I will do anything. Is that what you want?",
        "Tammy: What happened that night, joey? You're not that kind of guy. I know you're not. Did you really choose lizzie over me? You love me. This makes no sense. Unless you're a liar. I don't think you are. How is it possible that you don't remember anything?",
        "Joey: What's with this? Does this look familiar?",
        "Lizzie: What's that about, joey?",
        "Joey: See, lizzie, I've been trying to figure out what happened the night of the storm, why it's such a big blur to me.",
        "Lizzie: Well, not for me.",
        "Joey: And I was thinking, the only possible way you could have ever gotten me into the bed is if I was drunk or dead.",
        "Lizzie: Don't say that, please.",
        "Joey: Lizzie, I just got back together with tammy that night. Why would I go to you?",
        "Lizzie: Because I love you, joey.",
        "Joey: Right, right. Right. And we slept together, right? Your first. Only for some strange reason, i don't remember any of it. Any idea why? It's funny, lizzie, I don't even remember what you looked like that night. Maybe you weren't even worth remembering.",
        "Lizzie: Stop it, joey.",
        "Joey: See, lizzie, I'm the type of guy who remembers stuff. So I figure the only reason why I don't remember what happened was because of this. You drugged me.",
        "Reva: I really don't think there's anything to worry about with these emails. I think it's probably just a friend that's joking around, you know. But if you are concerned, we can take the whole computer down to the police station and have them check the emails and see if they know how track wherever they're coming from.",
        "Sandy: They're not going to be able to do anything that i haven't done already.",
        "Reva: How do you know that?",
        "Sandy: Reva, do you have any idea how good I am with the computer skills?",
        "Reva: Pretty good.",
        "Sandy: Good enough to hack into spaulding's files, amongst other things. But this person may be better. I can't trace them. They keep finding new back doors into my system.",
        "Reva: So you're really spooked by this whole thing?",
        "Cooper: I know that phillip spaulding drives a really, really fast car.",
        "Buzz: And?",
        "Cooper: And one way to make a really fast car not so fast is to put sugar in the gas tank.",
        "Buzz: But that would be childish.",
        "Cooper: Absolutely. I know.",
        "Buzz: Mr. Immature. You should be ashamed yourself.",
        "Cooper: Oh, I am. I am.",
        "Buzz: That's so...",
        "Cooper: Childish?",
        "Buzz: So what are we waiting for?",
        "Cooper: Absolutely.",
        "Buzz: You know a lot, don't you?",
        "Cooper: I really do.",
        "Buzz: I find that annoying.",
        "Cooper: Well, it's more than you give me credit for.",
        "Buzz: You like to annoy me?",
        "Cooper: I try to do it as often as I can.",
        "Alexandra: And here's a little tip to show good faith on my part.",
        "Gus: Go on.",
        "Alexandra: Well, phillip's achilles heel is beth.",
        "Gus: Beth?",
        "Alexandra: Yeah. She's always been able to, well, manage him better than any of the other of us. In fact, I think she's probably only person in the world he truly loves, no matter what the relationship. In the end, he always listens to her.",
        "Gus: She must have some magic power.",
        "Alexandra: Yeah, well, recruit her to your cause, and I'll tell you that you'll have phillip by the short hairs.",
        "Harley: Oh, my god. That guy is a powder keg. He threatened me. He grabbed my arm. I think I'm bruised.",
        "Bill: Are you kidding me?",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Bill: Well, I think maybe we're getting to him.",
        "Harley: I'm sure we are. It's just...",
        "Bill: What?",
        "Harley: He's going to blow. I am telling you, he is going to blow, and when he does, someone is going to get hurt.",
        "Bill: Wait a minute. Are you having second thoughts?",
        "Harley: No freaking way.",
        "Bill: That's what I thought.",
        "Phillip: I want you to keep an eye on my son zach for me.",
        "O'hagan: What am I looking for?",
        "Phillip: The influence that his mother and the rest of the coopers may be having on him. Just stay close.",
        "O'hagan: I'll be his shadow. Anything else?",
        "Phillip: Yes, miss spencer is currently overseas, and rumor has it that she's trying to rally support among foreign stockholders against me.",
        "O'hagan: That could be dealt with.",
        "Phillip: Make some calls. When she tries to reenter the us, I want her held up at customs.",
        "O'hagan: Immigration will cooperate if they think she's a risk.",
        "Phillip: Then make her one.",
        "O'hagan: How long do you want her detained?",
        "Phillip: I don't care if she ever sets foot on us soil again. And the research project that i spoke to you about, forget about that. I found another candidate for the job. (Phone rings)",
        "Harley: That's the number i gave phillip.",
        "Bill: You're on as ruth. Remember?",
        "Ruth: Ruth speaking.",
        "Phillip: Ruth, phillip spaulding.",
        "Ruth: Yes, sir.",
        "Phillip: I have a little job for you. It's a research project. I would like you to try to dig up every piece of dirt that you can find on harley cooper.",
        "Ruth: Harley copper, sir?",
        "Phillip: Yes, she's one of my ex-wives, zach's mother. She's giving me some trouble right now with my son.",
        "Ruth: How unfortunate, sir.",
        "Phillip: Oh, it's okay. We're going to nip it in the bud. That's where you come in. It may take a little digging, but I'm not sure if you work hard enough, there'll be something to find.",
        "Ruth: I can do that, sir.",
        "Phillip: Excellent.",
        "Ross: Next on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Michelle: I don't want to relive all the bad stuff that's happened, okay? I would rather think about the fun that we had when we were here.",
        "Edmund: Come away with me, cassie. Let's pack up the kids, get on a plane, go away, and never look back."
