        "Sandy: If you wanted to blow me off, you didn't have to make up an excuse.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Can I freshen up your drink, Sir? I think that would be bourbon, right?",
        "Josh: I thought this was your night off. Johnny boy asked me to cover for him. By the way, that was neat what you did earlier.",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Billy: You know, letting Reva see you with that little number from the television station.",
        "Josh: Bill... that's not what it was about.",
        "Billy: Man, it's not like you're dating her or anything.",
        "Stephanie: Hi ya, handsome. Didn't keep you waiting too long I hope.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: It's an awful lot of stuff for such a little person. ( Laughs )",
        "Cassie: Hey, what are you doing here?",
        "Reva: I came in the back door. Fewer steps. I had to get another peek at my beautiful little niece.",
        "Cassie: Beautiful. Well, she's sleeping so sit down, I'm going to get you some tea. How's your back doing?",
        "Reva: Well, it's not so bad that I can't clean or cook or do something for you. Give me a job.",
        "Cassie: I don't need you to cook and clean, I need you to answer a question. What's wrong with you and Josh?",
        "Reva: Uh, well, actually there's nothing wrong with Josh. It's me.",
        "Cassie: Okay. What's wrong with you?",
        "Reva: Do you know what I did?",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Reva: I actually made Josh think that I had this hot lunch date with a friend of Billy's. Only I didn't, you know? I was lying the whole time. I made up the whole story like that because I saw Josh sitting with this beautiful younger woman who I happen to know and I just... I flipped. You know? I flipped. I just... I'm losing him, Cassie. I really think that I'm losing it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: Jeffrey, you said you wanted to see me?",
        "Jeffrey: Hello, Ross.",
        "Ross: What's this about? I've had a long day, I want to spend time with Blake and the kids.",
        "Jeffrey: We're even. I'd like to go spend time with Cassie and her new baby.",
        "Ross: So what's stopping you?",
        "Jeffrey: This.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Oh, Honey. Oh, that looks good. I don't want to talk about this anymore. I want to talk about the father of the year. Where's Edmund?",
        "Cassie: Well, if you would have come in the front door you would have seen him outside having a cigar with Jonathan.",
        "Reva: You're kidding, right?",
        "Cassie: Uh-uh. If she can get those two to get along, then Hope truly is a miracle child.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Tell me what you did with Dinah or how you got that baby. Did she fall out of the sky?",
        "Edmund: I don't owe you explanations.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. I'll go inside to talk to Cassie. I'm sure she'll be pumped to know Dinah had a baby and she wasn't pregnant.",
        "Edmund: You're not going to tell Cassie anything.",
        "Jonathan: Then come clean and tell me how you got that kid.",
        "Edmund: In that case go inside and tell Cassie, then tell Tammy, too. Since you're in love with the truth, go right inside and destroy their lives.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: You're the one who's lying to me. More than that, you're living a lie.",
        "Sandy: What?",
        "Tammy: Shrewsbury. Does it sound familiar? I went to your hometown, Sandy, to the church on Lancaster Drive.",
        "Sandy: Really?",
        "Tammy: You swore you had told me everything about your past. But you've left out one little detail: That Sandy Foster is dead. I saw the tombstone.",
        "Sandy: Of course you did. And, Tammy, I can explain that.",
        "Tammy: Before you do, tell me one thing if it's not too much, please. Who are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: So it would seem I'm a dead man unless I back off this investigation.",
        "Ross: So what is it you want me to do?",
        "Jeffrey: Double the resources available to me so that I can put the pressure on these guys and also protect my witnesses.",
        "Ross: What about protecting you?",
        "Jeffrey: I can handle that, don't worry. But I am concerned about keeping Cassie and her children safe. The note does say everybody dies unless I back off.",
        "Ross: Yes. Well, since you're talking to me and not Frank Cooper, I assume you don't want uniform police.",
        "Jeffrey: I don't want to scare Cassie and the kids. I don't want to resort to that just yet.",
        "Ross: Okay. I'll see what I can do. I'll give you whatever you need but I want you to do something for me in return.",
        "Jeffrey: You got it. Name it.",
        "Ross: Find Dinah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Stephanie, this thing here is my older brother Billie and Billie, this is one of our up and coming executive types at the station, Stephanie Curtis.",
        "Billy: Miss Stephanie Curtis, nice to meet you. I don't think you're up and coming you feel you have arrived if you call the boss man handsome. What would you like to drink?",
        "Woman: Whatever Josh is having.",
        "Billy: Another prune juice coming up.",
        "Josh: Funny. Very funny. Sorry, he doesn't know when to quit sometimes.",
        "Woman: That's okay. He's cute. But you, you obviously got the best of the Lewis genes.",
        "Josh: Speaking of genes, where do we stand on this Alzheimer's special? The early research....",
        "Woman: Josh, there is so much more to talk about than work.",
        "Josh: Like what?",
        "Woman: Like you. Come on, I want to get to know the real Josh Lewis.",
        "Billy: Oh, the real Josh Lewis. Now, there is a brainteaser. I'm telling you. Is it the man who young women call handsome in bars like this or is it the man who has two grown kids and has been in love with Reva Shayne for how many years is it now, Josh?",
        "Woman: The Josh Lewis you describe sounds like a man who's lived an amazingly full life. Lived it to the max.",
        "Billy: For years and years and years.",
        "Woman: Which also makes him sound like a man probably ready to move on, start a new life with no regrets, no looking back. What more could a girl ask for, right? So if you boys will excuse me for a moment.",
        "Billy: You going to powder your nose?",
        "Woman: I was going to say grab jell-o shots, loosen things up a bit. But okay.",
        "Josh: Look, Reva and I have been together for a long time but she's made her choice about how she feels about that. And now I'm making some choices of my own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: You know what's really amazing? It's that this tiny thing can just be elating and terrifying all at the same time. That something this small can actually bring out every one of your hopes and fears.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. I think it's amazing that you still get all mushy when you talk about babies. Especially when you have one that turned out like Jonathan. ( Laughs )",
        "Reva: Hey, that's unfair. And he hasn't really created any disasters lately, okay?",
        "Cassie: I know. I know, he's making some progress.",
        "Reva: Some? He's making a lot of progress and you just said yourself that he's out there with Edmund sharing a cigar or smoking a cigar or whatever you do with cigars. And that's... you know, that's special. I mean, if they can reach some kind of common ground then there really is hope for us all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: What are you waiting for? Go in. Set Cassie straight. Set her straight. Just don't forget what they do to the messenger.",
        "Jonathan: Well, there's not much worse they could think of me than they don't already. But you? This is going to be fun.",
        "Edmund: I wanted a baby. I wanted to give Cassie a baby. I wanted to make her dreams come true. I love Cassie but go on because you wouldn't know anything about that.",
        "Jonathan: How did you score that baby? Let's hear it.",
        "Edmund: I was crushed when Dinah told me that she had miscarried. It was my baby, Jonathan. It was my child. And no matter what you think of me, I wanted that baby. I loved that baby and I didn't want Cassie to go through the same loss that I had.",
        "Jonathan: No. You just didn't want Cassie to cut you loose.",
        "Edmund: Oh, I'm not going to deny that. I hoped the baby would bring us back together again. I did. And I was furious at Dinah for lying to me. But I knew in the end that Dinah was just trying to do what was best, too.",
        "Jonathan: Stop. Wanted a chance at you.",
        "Edmund: Dinah was desperate to prove herself to Cassie, to prove herself to everyone. That's why I told her to leave the belly pad on.",
        "Jonathan: Then what? Did you find a baby? You bought that baby, didn't you? One of those black market kids. What is it with you and babies? You've either got to kill them or buy them?",
        "Edmund: God, Jonathan, that baby was being sold like a used car. The mother didn't care where it wound up for the right price. Jonathan, look, I'm not... I'm not asking for sainthood here. I'm not. I'm just trying to give Hope a good home and give Cassie her miracle baby.",
        "Jonathan: What about Dinah?",
        "Edmund: Well, Dinah has Cassie's gratitude, which is what she wanted from the beginning.",
        "Jonathan: You'd think she'd stick around to enjoy it.",
        "Edmund: Redemption is one thing but deep-seeded jealousy another thing. In the final analysis, Dinah couldn't stand the idea of seeing Cassie happy again.",
        "Jonathan: No, Dinah's the only one who knew the truth, which made her dangerous, and once you pulled off this scam, expendable. Tell me what you did with Dinah.",
        "Edmund: Nothing. I did nothing with Dinah.",
        "Jonathan: I said tell me what you did with Dinah or it's not Cassie I'm going to go to, it's her new boyfriend, the D.A.! Changes from week to week, Jonathan. The real miracle here is that she's with us at all.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Yeah, it's a bigger miracle for some more than others.",
        "Cassie: What were you going to say when we walked out here. What do I need to understand, Edmund?",
        "Jonathan: That we can't get along no matter how hard we try and how cute the babies around here are.",
        "Edmund: This was my fault. This was all my fault. I brought Jonathan out here to accuse him of... of being up to something nasty with this visit and I was wrong. I think really he just wants to be part of this family.",
        "Reva: You know what? I'll go warm up the milk.",
        "Cassie: No, you need to go home and take care of stuff there.",
        "Tammy: I'll help.",
        "Cassie: No. Baby, you don't have to spend the night, go. Find your man, okay? I'm going inside.",
        "Reva: Hey, I'm really glad you came over here. It meant a lot to Cassie. And to me.",
        "Jonathan: You all right?",
        "Reva: Yeah. Yeah. I'm just a little sentimental, you know? All this talk about babies brings... well, it just reminds me that you're my baby. Good night.",
        "Jonathan: Good night.",
        "Reva: Good night.",
        "Tammy: You sure you don't need a hand tonight?",
        "Edmund: No. I think... I think we've got everything pretty much under control, Tammy. Thank you.",
        "Tammy: I think I should go meet Sandy, then. I think he's still at Company.",
        "Jonathan: I was headed to Company, too. Can I get a lift?",
        "Tammy: I guess.",
        "Edmund: Jonathan, Jonathan, um, thank you for not saying anything.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, I didn't do that for you I know what it's like to be a kid. Taken out of the only home you've ever known. I was thinking of that baby in there.",
        "Edmund: That baby in there is going to have a very good home.",
        "Jonathan: She'd better. And don't think I forgot about Dinah. That I still want to know what you did with her. If I find out you hurt her, did anything to her, all bets are off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: ( Sighs )",
        "Stephanie: We didn't leave that bar because you wanted to get something to eat.",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Stephanie: Well, I have an older brother, too, so I know the drill.",
        "Josh: Yeah. I should... uh, apologize for my brother Billy. Sometime he is doesn't know when to stop.",
        "Stephanie: He was married to Reva at one point, too, wasn't he?",
        "Josh: You've done your homework.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, yes. Especially when I have an interest in the subject.",
        "Josh: Well, I'm flattered, I am, but the truth is, you don't know me at all.",
        "Stephanie: No, but I know you better than I did a few hours ago and even then I still knew you were part of a vanishing breed.",
        "Josh: It's really good for my ego to have a lovely young lady....",
        "Stephanie: Yeah?",
        "Josh: Look, the truth is, I'm... I'm not at all single.",
        "Stephanie: Uh-huh.",
        "Josh: Strictly speaking.",
        "Stephanie: Okay. Well I'm willing to work around that if you are.",
        "Josh: Well, that's a very nice offer. Very tempting.",
        "Stephanie: I know. That's why you asked me out.",
        "Josh: Actually, I didn't ask you out. I....",
        "Stephanie: Yes, yes, you asked me out. Now, Josh, let's not play any games here. I might be younger than you but we're both adults here. Isn't that a good thing?",
        "Josh: I'd be lying to you and to myself if I were to say that I didn't want this to go further. But....",
        "Stephanie: So what's the problem?",
        "Sandy: Hey there, Josh. I'm so glad you're here. I'm sorry. Am I interrupting something?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Okay, everybody, that was it. Drink up, it is getting late.",
        "Reva: Late? The night is young, pal, even if you're not. (Laughs).",
        "Billy: Hey, what are you doing in here?",
        "Reva: You're not going to card me, are you?",
        "Billy: No, Darling, I can vouch for your age. But your timing's bad. I'm closing, Reva.",
        "Reva: I'm giving you reason to stay open. I was feeling like maybe a bourbon.",
        "Billy: Reva...",
        "Reva: Come on, you run the joint! Give me one on the house.",
        "Billy: Okay. One bourbon and it will be on the house.",
        "Reva: See, that's more like it. Cheers.",
        "Billy: (Laughs) I suggest you drink that up and head over to Company and get yourself a snack.",
        "Reva: I'm not hungry.",
        "Billy: Reva, they got food over there, they got stuff. They got some really good stuff.",
        "Reva: Does Buzz have you on his paycheck now?",
        "Billy: No, it's just a suggestion.",
        "Reva: No, it's not. The hell it is. (Laughs) You're twisting my arm to go to Company. Why?",
        "Billy: Because Josh is there. And he's not alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: It's hard to take your eyes off her, isn't it?",
        "Edmund: Thank you, Cassie. Really, thank you for letting me share this.",
        "Cassie: Of course, Edmund. She's amazing, isn't she?",
        "Edmund: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: Thank you, Sweetie. Thank you for letting me be a mommy again. Sorry.",
        "Edmund: That's all right. Cassie, why don't you go to bed? I'll sit with Hope for a while.",
        "Cassie: That's okay, I got it.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, you're exhausted.",
        "Cassie: I am pretty wiped out.",
        "Edmund: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: Are you sure you can handle this?",
        "Edmund: Maybe. Maybe.",
        "Cassie: Okay. All right. Come on. You call me if there's anything...",
        "Edmund: I will. I will but I think we'll be fine. Won't we Angel? We'll be fine, yes.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Good night.",
        "Edmund: Good night. You know, Cassie, I think we did one thing right, didn't we?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. I think we did Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Good night. Mommy's coming around. She is. And that's all because of you. I know that smile of hers anywhere. You are going to bring her back into my... ( Phone rings ) Hello?",
        "Jeffrey: Put her on. I want to talk to her.",
        "Edmund: She's asleep. May I take a message?",
        "Jeffrey: No. I'll call back.",
        "Edmund: No, don't call back because I'm going to disconnect the phone. Hope's asleep, too, and I don't want either of them to be disturbed. Is that clear? Thank you so much for calling. Good night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I will have another one for the road.",
        "Billy: Darling, didn't you hear what I just said?",
        "Reva: Josh is at Company and he's not alone.",
        "Billy: Right.",
        "Reva: I know that but, you know, he's with somebody. Somebody female, right?",
        "Billy: Go and find out.",
        "Reva: The last thing I want to do is walk in on him and whatever it is. It's Stephanie, isn't it? No, don't tell me.",
        "Billy: I wasn't going to tell you.",
        "Reva: Yeah, but you know. You know. You know enough because you were at Company and you saw Josh at Company with company.",
        "Billy: All I know you're here and he's there and that's bad.",
        "Reva: You and Cassie should tag team together because she was giving me the same stuff tonight earlier. Grappling with it, you know?",
        "Billy: Darling, we both love you.",
        "Reva: I wish I could patch this up, that I could sit down with Josh and one, two, three, all of our problems would be over. But that's not how it's going to work this time around. Not this time.",
        "Billy: Have you tried?",
        "Reva: We have hit the wall. Or at least I have. And it has nothing to do with love because God knows I will love that man always.",
        "Billy: And that's not enough?",
        "Reva: I wish I could say it was. Give me another bourbon please. Okay? Just one more. Let me tell you something, Billy. I'm starting to get a handle on what this is that I'm going through but I need some time to work through it.",
        "Billy: Well, like I've been telling you, time is something you may just be running out of.",
        "Reva: Why? Is Josh getting serious with this mystery date?",
        "Billy: Josh is moving on with his life. Darling, I hate to say this but it's looking more and more like when you get all these questions answered and you've got something to say to him, Josh isn't going to be around to here it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Stephanie, this is....",
        "Stephanie: Sandy. Yeah, I remember from when I first started at WSPR. You were working on the show with Reva.",
        "Sandy: How's it going, Stephanie?",
        "Stephanie: We were just talking shop. Josh has been a dream of a boss.",
        "Josh: We were just talking about this new program that sound really exciting.",
        "Sandy: Then I should probably take off because I just wanted to talk to you about totally non-business related stuff.",
        "Stephanie: No, no. You just stay here, we were just wrapping up. It's late, actually. So, um, I will get that revised script to you tomorrow?",
        "Josh: Let me... I'll walk her out. I'll be right back.",
        "Josh: Thank you for....",
        "Stephanie: Covering for you? You're terrible.",
        "Josh: If it wasn't already obvious that I'm not ready to dive back into the dating pool it must be....",
        "Stephanie: Hey, hey, it's okay. It's okay. I'll help you get your feet wet. We'll go from there.",
        "Sandy: Wow. Beautiful woman.",
        "Josh: Yeah. Yeah. yeah, she's great.",
        "Sandy: You really seem to have a way with the ladies.",
        "Josh: Yes, I do, Sandy. ( Laughs )",
        "Sandy: Which is why, actually I need to talk to you. If you can't help me figure out what I need to do about Tammy, nobody can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Thanks for the ride.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Is Sandman in there waiting for you or something?",
        "Tammy: He said he would be.",
        "Jonathan: You want me to go in there with you just in case he's morphed into something else? It might be tough to recognize him.",
        "Tammy: He explained the tombstone. Sandy Foster is his maternal grandfather's name and Sandy took the name when he left home.",
        "Jonathan: Oh. Sounds convincing.",
        "Tammy: Why do you automatically assume it's a lie?",
        "Jonathan: Because the guy's done nothing but lie to you since he came to town.",
        "Jonathan: Look who's talking. You were lying tonight.",
        "Jonathan: What?",
        "Tammy: At the farm. You made it seem like a joke that you and Edmund were fighting with each other. Like it was no big deal. I could tell you were this close to ripping each other's throats out so why? You want to tell me the truth?",
        "Jonathan: You don't want to know?",
        "Tammy: Yeah, I do. What was going on?",
        "Jonathan: Not what, who. Dinah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "( Baby cries )",
        "Edmund: Shh, it's all right. No, it's okay. It's okay. Go back to sleep. It's okay. Shh. No, Sweetheart, come on.",
        "Cassie: Edmund, is she okay?",
        "Edmund: She's fine. She's fine. I just need to get her back to sleep. Come on, work with me, Princess. Work with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Here you go. Thanks for the drinks.",
        "Billy: Yeah, sure. Hey, look, I'm... I'm leaving now. Why don't I give you a ride home?",
        "Reva: I'm fine.",
        "Billy: But I'm the designated driver here so I'm going to drive you home.",
        "Reva: You are so much more than that.",
        "Billy: Yeah, I'm the answer to every woman's dreams.",
        "Reva: That would be a 30-carat diamond and peanut butter fudge for the rest of my life. But you run a close second.",
        "Billy: I love you. Does Josh know what he's missing here? Does he really?",

        "Reva: Do you like it?",
        "Billy: Well, it has its moments.",
        "Reva: Well, then I guess I like it, too. But it's a hell of a lot more fun being alone together. Billy:( Laughs )",

        "Sandy: I know what you're thinking. You're thinking I shouldn't be flipped out about Tammy because you're young. But you and Reva got together when you were young and look how you guys turned out.",
        "Josh: Sandy...",
        "Sandy: Sure, you've had your issues and problems, who hasn't. But the constant that's kept you guys together is the love that you have together.",
        "Josh: Except sometimes...",
        "Sandy: Sometimes love isn't enough. You don't have to tell me that. But you have to prove everyday how you feel and the only way to do that is to make a choice, a promise, a commitment. Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm not putting words in your mouth, that's what you were going to say, right?",

        "Cassie: Oh, yeah. What's that?",
        "Edmund: You're right about me. You said I was going to want to be the best man I could possibly be for my new child. Now that Hope's here-- don't laugh at me-- but I think I want to be nothing short of Hope's hero.",
        "Cassie: I would never laugh at that. There's nothing more important than being a hero for your little girl, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Hero, new so you don't think that's beyond me?",
        "Cassie: I couldn't say. You just have to be a part of her life and you have to love her.",
        "Edmund: She can count on me for that. So can you.",
        "Cassie: Good night, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Okay, good night. Yeah, Hi. It's me. Did you send the message? Good. Good. Make you're sure there's no way O'Neill can trace it back to me, Righting? Good. No, I don't think we're going to need a follow-up message. I think Mr. O'Neill knows what's good for him, knows what keeps him safe, knows what keeps stay people he loves. Right. And if he needs a follow up, I'll give you a call. Bye-bye. Sleep. You sleep. You have had a very, very busy day changing everyone's life. That's right. That's what you did and I knew you would. Uh-huh. And that was the whole idea P.. you know, Sweetheart, they say dreams don't come true. But Daddy's dream is coming true. And there is not anything anyone can do to stop it.",

        "Jonathan: Right, well, I don't know. We had... we had a great time together, you know? A lot of fun, and then Eddie came around with his big talk of Dinah redeeming herself like she'd be the most loved woman in town if she carried your mother's bun around in her oven for nine months. And Dinah bought it. And then we were over. And now that the kid's here, she's totally gone.",
        "Tammy: Do you miss her?",
        "Jonathan: Dinah was straight with me. I was the same way with her. Honesty like that is hard to come by around here.",
