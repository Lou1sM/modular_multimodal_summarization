I can't believe you were crazy enough to buy me a bike. (Laughs)", "Tony: Well, you know, you look good on it.", "Michelle: Yeah, I do. Why did you do it? Why did you buy me a bike?", "Tony: What do you mean? You liked being on mine, so...", "Michelle: And?", "Tony: And I wanted you to have something, michelle, all on your own.", "Michelle: I just can't believe it! Oh!", "Tony: You've got to know by now there's nothing I wouldn't do for you, right?", "Michelle: You know, this is the place that you brought me that night after the barbecue.", "Tony: Yeah. (Laughs) and it was the start of something. The start of something, michelle, that we need to talk about.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Blake: Yeah, hi, this is blake. (Laughs) yeah, chrissie, I was looking for my father. I got a note from him with some flight information and then i got this crazy e-mail that... is he there? Can I talk to him? Oh. Who is this? Okay. Will you tell him to call me, please? Because I need to know what's going on.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: Oh, you'll call me back to set up an interview? All right, I'll be sure to hold my breath.", "Marina: Can I get you anything else, danny?", "Danny: No, thanks. Can I get you anything, marina?", "Marina: You know, maybe you can. You know, the spauldings were trying to demolish this place, right?", "Danny: Mm-hmm.", "Marina: Well, I have to do something to stop them. Something drastic.", "Danny: Why are you whispering?", "Marina: Because I need help. The kind that you can't find in the yellow pages, if you get my drift.", "Danny: You want me to find you a hit man?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Joey: Lizzie, did you or didn't you put something in my drink that night at the hotel?", "Lizzie: Joey, do you think i really need drugs to interest a guy? I mean, look at me. Come on.", "Joey: I wanted to be with tammy that night. Instead, I wind up in bed with you and I don't know how I got there. Then I find this on your new friend.", "Lizzie: You are so wrong, joey. You're so wrong.", "Joey: Lizzie, it's the only thing that makes sense. So tell me the truth or I walk away from here right now and you will never see me again.", "Lizzie: Joey! Okay... I did it. I'm really sorry, but I did it. Nb", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dinah: I think she'd have a lot tougher time getting past the fact that you're the one that caused the fire that nearly killed rj.", "Edmund: What?", "Dinah: You're the one who knocked out jeffrey and caused the fire in one fell swoop. I saw it. I saw the whole thing.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reporter: The arraignment of accused killer dinah marler has been scheduled. Marler is charged with shooting her ex-fiance, hart jessup. Jessup was linked with cassie winslow when he died. The trial is expected to involve months of sensational coverage.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rj: You're not my friend anymore. (Crash)", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tony: So, the night of the barbecue, do you remember why we left?", "Michelle: Yeah. I just found out I had a son, something that danny didn't think I was ready to know about. Of course, it all blew up in his face when that beautiful little boy found me. And then all those people at that party were all over me. I felt like the walls were closing in on me and I had to get out.", "Tony: So we hopped on my bike.", "Michelle: Yeah. We made the great escape.", "Tony: Michelle, it was the start of something that I wasn't ready to deal with.", "Michelle: I know.", "Tony: You do?", "Michelle: Yeah. You were feeling as alienated as I was.", "Tony: Well, that's not what i meant. Listen, what I was going to say is... ( laughs)", "Michelle: I don't want to relive all the bad stuff that's happened, okay?", "Tony: You don't?", "Michelle: No. I would rather think about the fun that we had when we were here, you know? Relive a little bit of the magic.", "Tony: No. No, no, no, no, no.", "Michelle: Come on.", "Tony: Listen. No, no. It's not july anymore; it's september. It's cold. No. Forget it.", "Michelle: Are you going to let a girl show you up? You are, aren't you?", "Tony: Really?", "Michelle: Mm-hmm.", "Tony: All right. Well, if you're going to catch pneumonia...", "Michelle: Aw! Baby going to catch a cold?", "Tony: ...So will I. No, baby is going to beat you out past that buoy before you can say anything at all.", "Michelle: Oh, really? Before I can say \"last one in is a rotten egg!\" Whoo! ( Water splashes)", "Tony: What do I have to do, sit on her to tell her I love her? Michelle!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marina: See, it's not like i want the spauldings killed or anything. I just want someone to, like, rough them up a little, you know?", "Danny: Break a few kneecaps?", "Marina: Yes. I mean, no. No. Well, maybe. Maybe phillip'S. Or just hit him a few times. I don't know, threaten to smash his pinkie until...", "Danny: Marina, I get what you...", "Marina: Ssh. Hey.", "Coop: Hey.", "Marina: What's up?", "Coop: I've got to go pick up a shipment of to-go cups that i forgot about, so...", "Marina: Great. See you later. You know, take your time.", "Coop: You know, I know that I'm a lousy waiter, but you really don't have to kick me out the door. Hey. I'm coop. I'm marina's uncle.", "Marina: Henry cooper bradshaw. World's worst waiter.", "Danny: Oh. How you doing? Danny santos.", "Coop: Santos. You know, maybe I should stick around for a little while.", "Marina: Danny is an old friend.", "Coop: Hm.", "Marina: We'll be fine. Go get the cups.", "Coop: All right. I'll be back shortly, okay?", "Danny: Nice to meet you.", "Coop: You, too.", "Marina: Danny, look, there's got to be something we can do.", "Danny: Marina...", "Marina: If we don't do something, my grandpa is going to lose everything.", "Danny: Okay, you have to understand something. When you make a threat like that, you've got to be prepared to follow through with it. And you're not. And the spauldings don't respond to intimidation.", "Marina: Well, there's got to be something we can do, okay. We can't just let them go around ruining people's lives.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: Joey, I put something in your drink, but listen, i didn't do it knowing that you would forget everything that happened between us. I just did it for fun, okay? Joey, please don't hate me for this. I just wanted that night to be perfect. Are you really sure you don't remember anything? I mean, the way you touched me and the way you held me...", "Joey: I don't remember a thing.", "Lizzie: Joey, I wanted you to be my first. I did it because I love you. I mean, can't you just look in my eyes and tell that I'm telling the truth when I say i love you?", "Joey: I can look in your eyes, all right, but I can see something, something I've never seen before.", "Lizzie: You can?", "Joey: You're as crazy as your father.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Hey, hey, what's going on? I'll get that for you.", "Cassie: No, no, I got it. I'm fine. Okay? I'm fine. Dinner's going to be ready really soon, okay. Oh, um, tammy, why don't you ask joey for dinner.", "Tammy: He's not around. Oh, whatever you're cooking smells really good. What's the occasion?", "Edmund: Well...", "Tammy: What's wrong?", "Edmund: No. For once, tammy, we have good news. It's wonderful news, in fact. Go ahead.", "Cassie: No, no, you.", "Edmund: But I think...", "Tammy: Okay, somebody. Please?", "Edmund: Well, tammy, your mother has agreed... um, the honor of agreeing to be my wife.", "Tammy: (Screams)", "Cassie: (Laughs)", "Edmund: So I take it you approve? It's okay?", "Tammy: Oh, finally some good news in this family. Well, details.", "Cassie: I'll give you details at dinner.", "Tammy: Okay. Rj, guess what?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rj: Mommy, look. It's daddy and my friend. What does this mean?", "Edmund: Hey, rj, how about a game of tag before dinner, huh?", "Rj: You're it.", "Edmund: Okay. I'm always it. That's not fair. Hey, come on.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: Feel better?", "Tammy: Not really. So much for our big celebration.", "Cassie: Everything is going to be okay, right? We're going to get past this. Just like we always do.", "Tammy: There's no getting past dinah. Girls like her do whatever they want and they get away with it.", "Cassie: That's not true.", "Tammy: Yes, it is. They always win.", "Cassie: No, they don't, okay. And don't you ever say that again.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: Joey, listen, you should be flattered that I care as much to even take that risk, okay. That night you didn't even care what happened. You told me I was beautiful and that you always wanted me, not tammy.", "Joey: Do you have any idea what you've done? You don't, do you, lizzie? If it were the other way around, I'd be in jail right now and i would deserve to be there. You didn't drug me because of your undying love for me, lizzie. You did it out of spite, because you knew I wanted tammy and you couldn't handle that. You knew I'd pick her.", "Lizzie: That's not true, joey. Who have you been hanging out with for the past four weeks? Me. Not tammy. Did you say, \"oh, backoff because I'm dating someone else?\" No!", "Joey: Lizzie, I told you i got back together with tammy. I told you that night.", "Lizzie: It didn't matter, though. You had champagne and then you didn't even want to leave. You didn't even try to leave. You just started kissing me and so I thought you wanted me.", "Joey: Lizzie, thanks to you, I don't know what I was thinking that night, but I bet I felt sorry for you. I probably stuck around because I thought you were pathetic.", "Lizzie: Don't you ever talk to me that way.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: Everything is going to work out. Dinah is not going to win. She's not. Look, edmund and I are getting married. We are moving on with our lives. Everything is going to be okay. You'll see.", "Tammy: It's okay, mom. And the last thing you need to deal with is what's going on with me, so let's talk about the wedding.", "Cassie: No, let's talk about you. (Phone rings)", "Tammy: The phone.", "Cassie: I don't care. Let the machine pick it up. Really. I want to talk about you and what's going on with you. So why don't you help me cut the vegetables for the salad and we'll talk.", "Tammy: No, no, you have enough to deal with. You don't have to worry about my problems.", "Cassie: Winslow residence? You know what to do.", "Cassie: Really. What we talking about? Yeah, this is bob kushel over at woq 102.", "Cassie: Okay, no more interruptions. So, please, what's going on?", "Tammy: Nothing. I'm fine. I'm going to hang out in my room for a little while. Just call me for dinner.", "Cassie: Great.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rj: What's wrong?", "Edmund: Oh, I was just thinking.", "Rj: About what?", "Edmund: I was thinking about how lucky I am and how happy i am to be a part of this wonderful family. You know, I can't imagine what life would be like without you. Hey, see that star way, way over there? If I could wish on that star and it would come true, I wish that we could all be whisked away to some magical place where there's nary a dark cloud or worry in the sky. Think, rj, do you know a place like that? Think, think. You know what? Let's go inside. I think dinner's about to be ready. Come on.", "Cassie: Sorry, guys, it's going to be a little longer.", "Edmund: Where's tammy?", "Cassie: She's up in her room. I guess I scared her off.", "Edmund: All right. Rj, I want you go upstairs and finish building your secret fort, okay?", "Rj: Gotcha.", "Edmund: Gotcha. Go. Okay. Cassie, I can fix everything. You don't have to think about dinah marler again. You don't have to worry about what you're going to say at trial. And tammy could just walk away from this entire nightmare. We can all walk away from it, and then we can just keep on walking.", "Cassie: What are talking about?", "Edmund: Come away with me, cassie. Let's pack up the kids, get on a plane, go away and never look back.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: What, you trying to ply me with pie?", "Marina: No. I'm just... I'm sorry, okay. I...", "Danny: Why?", "Marina: I didn't mean to hurt your feelings before.", "Danny: You didn'T. You didn'T. Believe me, I'm very use to everybody in this town looking at me like that. That's why I can't get a stupid job. Once everyone has an opinion of you, it's pretty much impossible to get them to change it.", "Marina: So use it, you know, against them.", "Danny: Yeah? You think I should smash some skulls in until I get an interview?", "Marina: No, like I'm going to do with the spauldings. Okay, they look at me and they see this irritating kid, right?", "Danny: I don't know about that.", "Marina: Yeah, like they pat me on my hand and they ignore me like I'm ten or something. Well, that's good. No, it's great, because they won't see me coming until i smash them into the ground like bugs.", "Danny: Okay, marina, look, i completely understand why you want to save this place, but bringing in muscle is not the way to do it. It's a dead end. It does not get you what you want.", "Marina: Do you miss it? The power? Having people fear and respect you just for being a santos?", "Danny: Sometimes. But it's not worth it to go backwards. It's not. I fought to hard to have the life that I have now and I would never want to jeopardize the safety of my wife or my son for anything.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: Wasn't that better than last time?", "Tony: Yeah, a little bit.", "Michelle: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.", "Tony: Yeah?", "Michelle: Oh. Thank you for being crazy with me.", "Tony: Oh, michelle, you don'T... you don't have to thank me.", "Michelle: You know you never disappoint me.", "Tony: No? I don't?", "Michelle: Well...", "Tony: You know, you're probably... you're probably the only person in my life that could say that. You know that?", "Michelle: I don't like it when you fight with danny. It gets on my nerves when you do the whole \"I'm out of here\" thing. Yeah, I don't like that. But, overall, you've been really great to me-- starting with the time you carried me out of the burning warehouse. That was pretty good. Although we didn't really get to know each other until you brought me here. This place is kind of special for us. I know that this is where danny and I were going to build our house and everything, but, to be honest, the memories I have for this place are with you. You changed everything for me that night. You made me realize that what i was feeling was okay.", "Tony: You did the same for me, michelle. You did the same for me. Coming up on \"guiding light.\"", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Wait a minute, cassie. You can't just grab a gun and...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: If dinah wants to give us a surprise visit, I'm going to make sure the surprise is hers.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: And I really love being close to you. And I think that we'd be really good together. Oprah: How to really know if he's into you or not. Next \"op", "Tony: Listen, michelle, i need to tell you something, okay. And it's like every time I start to, something happens and I'm afraid I'm not going to say it right. So I just...", "Michelle: Me first. Me first.", "Tony: No, please? Please?", "Michelle: No, no. I... you know, this thing that we got going on...", "Tony: Yep.", "Michelle: It's really important to me.", "Tony: Well, it is to me, too. And that's what...", "Michelle: Sh. I just... I want you to know that I realized that I can always count on you, and that you'd never let me down, tony. Never.", "Tony: I never would.", "Michelle: And I really love being close to you, like knowing you, you know, in a way that i know not a lot of people do. We balance each other, you know.", "Tony: Yeah, we do.", "Michelle: And I think that we'd be really good together in so many ways.", "Tony: You do? Really? Well, so do I, you know.", "Michelle: But I don't think that we're going to get a chance to find that out. Oh, god, this is hard.", "Tony: Say it.", "Michelle: You know when i woke up... when I was first woke up, danny was being so rigid, you know, and he was so disappointed that I wasn't this person that he wanted me to be and I just felt like I was never going to be able to live up to his expectations, you know. That's why I was ready to walk, right? Remember? And you convinced me to stay. You know, you told me to relax. You told me to just be myself and let whatever happen, happen. And I did. And it did.", "Tony: So you and danny...", "Michelle: There's just something there, tony, that i need to explore. You know what I mean? I just... I'm starting to...", "Tony: Starting to what, michelle? Hm? Starting to what?", "Michelle: I'm starting to realize why I loved him.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Blake: Hey, dad, I talked to that guy that works for and i told him that I really need to talk to you. Why do you want me to do this, and what exactly does it have to with michelle? Are you coming here? Call me. Bye.", "Danny: Yep. All right. Thanks, anyway.", "Blake: Good. I found you.", "Danny: Here I am. Why?", "Blake: I have some houses that I think you would be interested in.", "Danny: No, blake, no. No houses. I can not afford a house right now.", "Blake: Oh. Really?", "Danny: Really.", "Blake: So what are you going to do? Are you going to move back into the lighthouse with michelle?", "Danny: I don't know. I haven't decided anything yet.", "Blake: Oh, but you might move back into the lighthouse with michelle? I mean, it's a great space, danny, and the view is phenomenal. And you have spent a lot of time out there.", "Danny: Blake, blake, blake. I know what you're going after. You're not going to get it. So just knock it off, okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: Joey, I am so sorry. I didn't mean to hit you. Okay, you're the last person on this earth that I'd ever want to hurt. Joey. Joey, please. Just forgive me, okay. Just give me another chance. I promise you I'll never do it again. Joey, we can work through this.", "Joey: Let go of me, lizzie.", "Lizzie: Joey, you can't go. You're the only one who treats me like I'm a real person. Just maybe you could learn to love me. If you try, you can. Please? Please try and love me.", "Joey: You disgust me, lizzie, and I can never love anyone like you.", "Lizzie: Joey, you got to come... tammy's never going to forgive you for what you did with me! Joey...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: What are you doing here?", "Jb: I suddenly show up and someone needs my services.", "Tammy: Ha, ha. I've had a laugh. You can go now.", "Jb: Ouch. She hates me.", "Tammy: She wants to be alone.", "Jb: You can shun me if you want, but I'm not the bad guy here. All I did was tell you what lizzie and joey were doing.", "Tammy: They were only together once.", "Jb: That we know about.", "Tammy: Is that why you're not with lizzie tonight?", "Jb: Lizzie and I were just hanging out. I really don't care who she hooks up with.", "Tammy: Good thing you don'T. She's capable of just about anything these days. I kind of wonder she maybe tricked joey somehow.", "Jb: You think she tricked a guy into having sex with her? I'm sorry to burst your bubble, but guys don't work like that.", "Tammy: You know, I really don't want to have this conversation, so just leave me alone.", "Jb: If you wanted to be alone, I don't think you would have come in here. I think... I think you're looking for a friend.", "Tammy: I really don't care what you think.", "Jb: You know, I think I know you pretty good already. I bet you ten bucks you had to sneak out of the house tonight. I'm not judging you. You know, I think it's cute.", "Tammy: Hey, I'm not cute. Or sweet. Or any of those things. I can be just as bad as the next girl.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: I want you to think. I want you to think you're someplace far away. You're in a ballroom in paris. No, no, no, no, here. You're in a tavern, in a country tavern in a little country village and you're relaxed and you're happy. You're safe. You don't have a care in the world.", "Cassie: That's a very nice fantasy, but...", "Edmund: It doesn't have to be a fantasy, cassie. It doesn'T. I can be ambassador from san cristobal almost anywhere in the world. Let's go there. Wherever you like. We could find someplace where you'll never hear the name dinah marler again. You'll be safe, you'll be protected and you'll be loved.", "Cassie: What about my hotel and the business and my sister, you know?", "Edmund: Cassie, will you do this for me, please? I want to protect you. I want to protect you. Come away with me. Say yes. Say yes, cassie.", "Cassie: No, edmund. No. I can't do that, okay? I can'T. I can't run away. I'll keep looking over my shoulder, waiting for the past to catch up with me. And I'm not going to let dinah marler run me out of town.", "Edmund: We won't be running out of town, cassie. We'll be moving on to a better life.", "Cassie: We can do that. I have moved my kids around everywhere. We have a home here and I'm going to stay here and I'm going to fight.", "Edmund: All right, all right, how about plan b, then? We go somewhere and just take a break for a little while. Get away from all this, just for a bit.", "Cassie: I can'T. I can't leave now, edmund. I can'T. But I promise you... I promise you that when this whole mess with dinah is over, I want plan B. I want it with you, okay?", "Edmund: You're right. You're right. You can'T. You can'T.", "Cassie: I can'T.", "Edmund: And, so, if you're going to face... if you're going to face dinah, then you have to know the truth. I have to tell you everything.", "Cassie: Who was that?", "Edmund: What?", "Cassie: Did you hear that?", "Edmund: Hear what?", "Cassie: She's here. She's here!", "Edmund: Who's here? Cassie?", "Cassie: Dinah. She must have gotten out of jail.", "Edmund: Wait a minute, cassie. You can't just grab a gun and...", "Cassie: If dinah wants to give us a surprise visit, I'm going to make sure the surprise is hers.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tony: It's getting cold. We should go. Don't forget your shoes.", "Michelle: Tony? Hey!", "Tony: What?", "Michelle: You know, this doesn't have to change anything between us, right?", "Tony: No, no. Not at all.", "Michelle: Good. Good, because I just want you to understand.", "Tony: Listen, michelle, I get it. You know, I didn'T... you like having both me and my cousin around, so it's okay.", "Michelle: Yeah, but not in the way that you mean.", "Tony: Look, michelle, we're partners. We're starting a club together. That's all. Nothing's going to change, all right? Okay, nothing's going to change. Look, it's cold. Let's go.", "Michelle: Tony, you are as important to me as danny ever will be.", "Tony: Okay.", "Michelle: Anything that I'll ever have with him will be. So I don't want you to back away from this.", "Tony: I'm not going anywhere, michelle. Okay, just don't push it, because you can't have everything you want.", "Michelle: Well...", "Tony: Well, what?", "Michelle: Why don't we just get some food, because I'm starving.", "Tony: You're wet and cold. Let's go.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Blake: So tell how the lighthouse project is going with michelle? Have you started construction yet? I mean, that's a lot of work. That's a lot of stuff to haul away. That's really time consuming. I bet you find a lot of interesting stuff there. Has she found interesting stuff there?", "Danny: (Sighs) like what?", "Blake: Well, I don't know. I mean, not like I have anything specific in mind or anything.", "Danny: Yeah, you do.", "Blake: Well, you don't have to be so edgy. I mean, what, did somebody steal the prize out of your cereal box this morning? (Laughs) I'm sorry. I've been a mom too long. Ooh, speaking of my kids, I've got to go pick them up.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Coop: You know what they call creatures who hang out waiting for something to die? They're called spauldings.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: What, are you actually surprised we have feelings?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jb: I've known chicks like you before and bad girl wannabes afraid to take the leap.", "Tammy: I am not afraid of anybody or anything.", "Jb: Good. And if you're serious about loosening up, I have something that might do the trick. You can call me the elevator operator, because I can take you up and I can take you down.", "Tammy: I don't do drugs.", "Jb: More for me. Not that I really care about them, either, but... what?", "Tammy: I don't get you. First, you dated lizzie for, like, five seconds and now you're hitting on me. What's the deal?", "Jb: I do whatever I want whenever I want. It's a good ride. You should try it sometime.", "Tammy: I just might. It seems to work for everybody else.", "Jb: What, is that a \"just might\" or are you converted?", "Tammy: Get me another beer.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Cassie, it can't be dinah. Just lower the gun.", "Cassie: Turn off the lights, edmund. Turn off the lights. You take one more step and you're dead.", "Joey: Whoa! Don't shoot. Don't shoot.", "Cassie: Oh, my god. I thought you... joey, what are you doing here?", "Joey: Is tammy around?", "Cassie: No, we heard noises around the side of the house.", "Joey: No, no, I went around back to see if tammy's light was on, and it wasn't, so I came around front and I let myself in. I know, I should have knocked. I should have knocked.", "Edmund: The gun, cassie. Just give me the gun.", "Cassie: I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. We thought... we thought there was a burglar, and I just... i would have never done anything to hurt you. Joey, I'm so sorry.", "Joey: It's okay. Is tammy here?", "Edmund: I'll check. Tammy?", "Joey: I noticed her car was gone.", "Edmund: Tammy?", "Cassie: She snuck out.", "Joey: Oh. I should go.", "Cassie: Joey, I'm sorry for this. I'm so sorry.", "Edmund: Hey, hey, hey. You all right?", "Cassie: How could I be all right? I almost shot that kid, edmund. I saw dinah. I actually saw dinah. I got to get out of here. I got to get out of here.", "Edmund: All right, I'll go with you.", "Cassie: No, no! I have to go alone.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jb: If you could be d anything tonight, what would it be?", "Tammy: I guess something that nobody would be expecting me to be doing.", "Jb: Like sitting in a bar with me? Nobody would think that, right?", "Tammy: What about you? What would you be doing? No, seriously.", "Jb: No, I am being serious. (Phone rings) it's joey lupo.", "Tammy: Tough.", "Jb: You're not going to answer it? Wow. Don't get mad, get even, huh?", "Tammy: Yeah.", "Jb: You want to get out of here?", "Tammy: Sure. Why not?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: So why don't you just get a bottle of champagne and celebrate, because I can tell you're enjoying this.", "Coop: You're delusional. Here. Blow your nose. Besides, the whole runny nose thing? It's not very attractive.", "Lizzie: Oh, these things are hard. Leave it to buzz to buy the cheap kind, right?", "Coop: You know, for a second there I really was actually feeling some pity and guilt for you.", "Lizzie: See, joey always carried a handkerchief.
