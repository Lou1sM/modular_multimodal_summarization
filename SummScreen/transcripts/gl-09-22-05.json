        "Harley: \"Corporate Novice?\" Well, it could be worse. They could have said, I don't know, \"Idiot.\"",
        "Gus: Good morning, Baby.",
        "Harley: Good morning.",
        "Gus: That's a cute picture.",
        "Harley: Yeah.",
        "Gus: Do you know what that picture says to me?",
        "Harley: Uh-uh.",
        "Gus: It says, \"Hey, I'm hot, yo, but if you get in my way, I will rip your head off and spit down your neck hole.\" That's what it says.",
        "Harley: ( Laughs ) Well, it should say \"I'm out,\" because I'm not taking that job.",
        "Gus: Oh, come on. Sure you are.",
        "Harley: I'm not. I'm not. I mean, after months of hell, my life is finally perfect. Why would I want to screw that up again? \"Corporate novice?\" ( Laughs )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: I need you to confirm my appointments for this afternoon.",
        "Ava: It's done. And I booked you a manicure appointment at 3:00 pm.",
        "Olivia: Great. The insurance agent I'm meeting is supposed to send some quotes over e-mail.",
        "Ava: I downloaded them.",
        "Olivia: Did you pull the figures from last year to compare? No. You didn't.",
        "Ava: ( Sighs )",
        "Olivia: It's okay. It's okay. You'll do it next time, right?",
        "Ava: ( Stammers )",
        "Olivia: It's... it's okay. Just relax. You're doing a lot better than I thought you would. Okay?",
        "Ava: Thanks. Oh, and I did something else for you. I cleared your schedule for the morning.",
        "Olivia: You what?",
        "Ava: Oh, well, I was... I was thinking maybe since you just got back from your trip, you'd want to spend some time with your husband and your daughter.",
        "Olivia: ( Sighs )",
        "Bill: Now, give that girl a raise.",
        "Olivia: I don't think so. Book me at 10:30 a big, sappy apology from my husband.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: It was a very thoughtful thing for Danny to do, wasn't it?",
        "Michelle: Yeah.",
        "Rick: Planting that in memory of your baby.",
        "Michelle: Yeah. Every year, it will grow and it will blossom the way she would have. You know, when I was pregnant, I had so many dreams about her. She was so beautiful.",
        "Rick: Just like her mommy. Michelle, I know this is hard for you to believe, but Sweetheart, you'll eventually get through this.",
        "Michelle: Mm-hmm. And it's going to be a lot easier for me to do if I'm not in Springfield. I made my decision, Rick. I'm going to actually go to California and work with Dad. It's not that big of a deal now that he's back in the country.",
        "Rick: Michelle?",
        "Michelle: I know you think I'm crazy.",
        "Rick: No. I don't think you're crazy. I think it's a wonderful idea, to go away for a little while and give yourself a chance to heal. And when you're feeling stronger, you can come back home.",
        "Michelle: I don't think so, Rick. There are too many memories here for me, and there always will be. I'm leaving Springfield for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Wild guess: Making notes on Michelle's accident?",
        "Marina: Well, I'm doing like you said and making a list of all possible questions.",
        "Mallet: Mm-hmm.",
        "Marina: But so far, mostly all I have to go on is a gut feeling.",
        "Mallet: Well, it's like I told you before: Gut feelings are very important.",
        "Marina: Even when they threaten the relationship with the man you love?",
        "Mallet: At this point, you have to ask yourself, what do you know and what do you believe deep down in your heart happened the night of Michelle's accident?",
        "Marina: That maybe it wasn't just an accident and that maybe Michelle's baby didn't die like everyone thinks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Let me ask you something.",
        "Gus: Yeah?",
        "Harley: Why are you pushing for me to do this job?",
        "Gus: Well, I just think it's kind of a stroke of genius, actually, on the Board's behalf just to take you in as CEO just like that. I think it's genius.",
        "Harley: Really?",
        "Gus: Yeah. Sure.",
        "Harley: Well, you're my husband so you have to say that, but also you know that this job does kill people. You still want me to do it?",
        "Gus: I'm not... I'm just saying that it seems like you light up when you talk about it. Did you notice that? And you like a challenge. You like... you like being in charge and you like wearing the pants. This is a chance for you to do all three.",
        "Harley: All right. Well, if you want me to go after what you think I want, I think you need to do the same.",
        "Gus: What?",
        "Harley: Well, your eyes light up whenever a certain \"carrying your badge again\" conversation comes up.",
        "Gus: Oh, no, no, no. Baby, I burned that bridge.",
        "Harley: Hey, if we could get me sprung from prison and we could make it down the aisle, I think anything's possible.",
        "Gus: ( Sighs ) Maybe. Maybe. But the only way that I'll do that is if you promise you would give it serious consideration and take the job at Spaulding.",
        "Harley: Deal.",
        "Gus: Deal?",
        "Harley: Deal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: So tell me the facts.",
        "Marina: There are none. I've made inquiries, tracked down leads, but so far on paper, Michelle's accident seems to be just an accident. And all the reports say that she delivered the baby herself and that the baby died in the fire.",
        "Mallet: Hm. So \"on paper,\" \"all reports,\" and this means you think it's all wrong. I think if you believe strong enough in your gut, then you won't quit, and therefore you can't worry about how you might hurt your boyfriend's feelings.",
        "Marina: I'll keep digging.",
        "Mallet: Okay.",
        "Marina: Thanks.",
        "Mallet: Mm-hmm.",
        "Harley: You were tough on her. No, I mean, that's good.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I'm trying. I'm trying to find that balance. Hey, the new CEO of Spaulding Enterprises?",
        "Harley: Well, that's what the vote said, anyway. ( Laughs )",
        "Mallet: Geez, come on. Do you even know what \"CEO\" means?",
        "Harley: Yes.",
        "Mallet: Well, I don't.",
        "Harley: I looked it up last night. ( Laughs )",
        "Mallet: Good for you. And good luck. Maybe I'll go out and buy some Spaulding stock.",
        "Harley: Thank you.",
        "Mallet: Mm-hmm.",
        "Harley: So, how's Marina doing?",
        "Mallet: She's got good instincts. She just needs to learn how to trust them more, you know? Not doubt herself so much. There's not much she can't do if she believes it.",
        "Harley: Yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll see.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Just taking off and not coming home? Come on!",
        "Michelle: Rick.",
        "Rick: What?",
        "Michelle: If I don't, every morning I'm going to wake up, I'm going to look out my window and I'm going to see this rose bush, and I'm going to think about my little girl. How I never got to hold her in my arms, never got to give her a name. And every day, I'm going to... I'm going to walk out on this patio and I'm going to think about the day Danny and I got married here, how I was so sure that nothing would ever come between us again. And I'm going to be stuck. I'm going to be stuck right where I am.",
        "Rick: No, you're not. You're not. Sweetheart, you're going to learn to live with this pain and focus on the things that I know still matter to you, like your family.",
        "Michelle: I am grateful for that. I am.",
        "Rick: What about your son? What about your son? What are your plans for Robbie?",
        "Michelle: Well, I'm going to work it out with Danny. You know, we'll have joint custody. It's not going to be ideal, but if I stay here and I am suffering, that's not going to be good for Robbie, either.",
        "Rick: You'll change your mind. You'll change your mind, you will. You'll be away for a while and you'll realize how much you just miss everybody and you'll come home again. So, you're really set on this, aren't you? So, how soon do you plan to leave?",
        "Michelle: As soon as I can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: And you think she gives you a hard time, huh? You want to know what this is all about?",
        "Ava: Um...",
        "Bill: Well, my wife is a little miffed, a little upset because I didn't come by and bring her to the airport, and I am so sorry.",
        "Olivia: Never showed up.",
        "Bill: So, I left you five messages explaining what... what was going on.",
        "Olivia: Let me ask you something, Ava.",
        "Ava: Mm-hmm?",
        "Olivia: Is there really any good excuse for a person who says that they love someone to just leave them hanging, waiting at Company, never know when they're going to show up, and luckily, Buzz Cooper offered to take her to the airport or she would have missed her flight.",
        "Bill: Buzz Cooper. Ah. Buzz Cooper. Oh, I'm sure he didn't mind, that little bird dog. Did you wear protection?",
        "Olivia: What?",
        "Bill: A helmet. He has a motorcycle.",
        "Olivia: What would you care? What do you think?",
        "Ava: Um, maybe he was rescuing someone from a burning building.",
        "Bill: See, that's nice.",
        "Olivia: Oh, is that what you were doing, honey?",
        "Bill: That's... well, it... uh, well, no, not exactly that.",
        "Olivia: Were you trapped under an overturned bus?",
        "Bill: Well, not exactly...",
        "Olivia: Were you herding... corralling a bunch of escaped water buffalo?",
        "Bill: No, but if that's what turns you on...",
        "Olivia: No, what would turn me on is if my husband would keep his promises to me.",
        "Bill: Honey, you know I was at the hospital with Michelle. You know that.",
        "Olivia: This isn't about Michelle. I'm not jealous.",
        "Bill: I know you're not jealous. I know you're not, because we are past that. We were past that ever since she went and stayed with us when she came back into town to keep herself hiding from Danny. We're past the...",
        "Olivia: This isn't about Michelle. This is about you ditching me for anything or anyone.",
        "Bill: Oh, baby, baby, baby. All right, I got it. Why don't you tell me what I can do to make it up to you?",
        "Olivia: I really don't think there is anything.",
        "Bill: You mean there's nothing? Nothing at all? How about if I did something like... ( Whispers )",
        "Olivia: ( Laughs ) ( Clears throat ) That is a possibility.",
        "Bill: Maybe?",
        "Olivia: I'm not saying yes.",
        "Bill: How about this? How about this? How about this? ( Whispers )",
        "Olivia: All right. But later. Right now I have to work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Hey. So, I wanted to ask you, how is it going with Mallet? I know he can be really tough on rookies.",
        "Marina: Oh, no, everything's fine. In fact, I'll be much better after I talk to...",
        "Harley: Olivia?",
        "Marina: No, Bill. I thought he was just...",
        "Harley: Oh, I think he went that way.",
        "Marina: Okay. I've got to go. See you later.",
        "Harley: Hey, Olivia, you got a minute?",
        "Olivia: Really?",
        "Harley: Really, really.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, sit down.",
        "Harley: I'm assuming you haven't seen the paper this morning yet.",
        "Olivia: No. Why?",
        "Harley: Well, I was offered a job and I wanted your input, because it's a position that you're familiar with.",
        "Olivia: What job is that?",
        "Harley: ( Clears throat ) CEO of Spaulding Enterprises.",
        "Olivia: ( Laughs ) Stop it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Talk to Michelle's friends. See if anyone knows anything. And try to stay on everyone's good side.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Just the man I wanted to see.",
        "Frank: Let me guess: You want to borrow some money.",
        "Gus: No, no, Frank. It's a lot simpler than that. Simpler, better, better for you, better for me, better for us, better for Springfield.",
        "Frank: Okay, now you're scaring me.",
        "Gus: Frank, it's about my badge. I want it back. I want to get back on the force.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Bill.",
        "Bill: Hey.",
        "Marina: You are a hard guy to catch up to.",
        "Bill: I didn't know anyone was trying. What's up?",
        "Marina: There's something I want to talk to you about, but I'm not so sure this is the best place.",
        "Bill: Why?",
        "Marina: Michelle.",
        "Bill: Well, I haven't seen her around, so...",
        "Marina: Oh. Okay.",
        "Bill: So?",
        "Marina: So...",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Marina: Over at the Beacon, I overheard you and Olivia say something about Michelle. She stayed with you guys when she first came back to Springfield, right?",
        "Bill: Uh, yeah, I think so, for a little bit. Why? What's up?",
        "Marina: Do you know exactly when she came back into town and did she stay with just you guys or did she stay with somebody else, too?",
        "Michelle: Marina, if you have questions about me, ask me. Don't go behind my back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: ( Laughs ) You as a CEO of Spaulding. That's funny.",
        "Harley: It's not that funny.",
        "Olivia: \"Corporate Novice.\" Now, that's an understatement.",
        "Harley: Well, the board voted me in.",
        "Olivia: Why?",
        "Harley: This was a bad idea.",
        "Olivia: No. No, no. Harley, come on. You want my advice? I'll give it to you.",
        "Harley: I can hardly wait.",
        "Olivia: You think this job is tough? It's a hundred times tougher than you can ever imagine. I mean, your time in prison will seem like a spa getaway compared to what the Spaulding machine will do to you. Your kids? You'll never see them. Gus? You'll never see him, too. And as far as the rest of your family...",
        "Harley: You managed to do it while you were being a wife and mother.",
        "Olivia: You don't want to. Do you?",
        "Harley: Not because I can't do it. Because there are other things I would rather do.",
        "Olivia: Then you should go do them, because you are in way over your head with Spaulding. They will eat you alive.",
        "Harley: I'll take what you said under advisement. Wow, that was practically ten whole letters. There may be hope for me yet.",
        "Ava: Olivia? You okay?",
        "Olivia: You know what happens when a shark stops swimming? She drowns.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Listen, this is the deal. Just say what you want to hear and I'll say it. How's that? Frank. Frank. I am the best cop you ever had. Come on, you know that's true. I got connections to the Bureau. I got connections to the Justice Department. None of your other boys have that. Frank, I tried the... I tried the whole corporate thing. I can't do it, Frank. I want to be back out on the streets and I want to crack some heads. I mean, I want to get the crack-heads off the streets is what I'm... Frank, just say yes. How hard is that? Just say yes. Y-e-s. Frank, if you don't say yes, I'm going to go and tell your sister. I will run and tell her.",
        "Mallet: Frank?",
        "Frank: Oh, hey, Mallet.",
        "Mallet: How's it going?",
        "Frank: Good, man.",
        "Mallet: Hey, I got that report on the Interrogation Class that I just taught. I wanted to show you that I ranked the cadets using ten different criteria, okay, and then it's all color-coded. Nice and clear.",
        "Frank: That's beautiful, man.",
        "Mallet: Thanks.",
        "Frank: Nice to have you back. This is terrific. As a matter of fact, the most organized cop I've ever known.",
        "Gus: Color-coded. ( Laughs ) Such a waste of time.",
        "Mallet: Says the guy who looks like a Chia Pet.",
        "Gus: I bet your underwear drawer is color-coded, too.",
        "Mallet: At least I have more than one pair.",
        "Gus: I don't wear underwear. That's how I got your ex-wife.",
        "Frank: It's brilliant. I just got a brilliant idea.",
        "Mallet: What, Frank?",
        "Gus: What?",
        "Frank: You want your badge back?",
        "Gus: Yes.",
        "Frank: Okay, well, you got it, under one condition.",
        "Gus: Name it. Go ahead. What?",
        "Frank: Meet your new partner: Detective AC Mallet.",

        "Harley: You don't look sick.",
        "Alan: What did you do? Come here to gloat?",
        "Harley: Nothing to gloat about. I haven't said I would accept the position. There's something I need to know first. If I take this job, does the war start all over again? You come after me and my family, guns blazing?",
        "Alan: On the contrary, I want you to take the job. I can't think of anyone who deserves that job more than you do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: I wasn't going behind your back, Michelle.",
        "Michelle: You were asking my best friend questions about me.",
        "Marina: Well, for a good reason.",
        "Michelle: What?",
        "Bill: All righty. Well, I think I'm going to get going. I stopped by to see if you wanted to do dinner or something, but...",
        "Michelle: Wait. Bill, you don't have to go.",
        "Bill: No, seriously. I'll give you a call later and we'll hit one of our old haunts, okay?",
        "Michelle: Um, I'm probably not going to have time. I have to pack. I'm going to California to work with my dad.",
        "Bill: California? But I thought your dad was in...",
        "Michelle: No, he's back in the country now. For a little while, anyway.",
        "Bill: Oh, wait a minute. How long are you going to go for?",
        "Michelle: I'm not coming back.",
        "Bill: Wait, wait, wait. Is it... Michelle, what are you... is this something you really want?",
        "Michelle: I'll miss you.",
        "Bill: Well, yeah, I'm going to miss you. What are you...",
        "Marina: Maybe I should go.",
        "Bill: ...Talking about? ( Cell phone rings ) Hold on a second. It's my phone. Olivia, what's up? Yeah. I know. All right, I'll be there in a few minutes. It's my wife. I'm in the doghouse again, apparently. Listen, I've got to go, but I'm not letting you leave to California without a fight, okay? So...",
        "Michelle: Okay.",
        "Bill: I'll talk to you later.",
        "Marina: Michelle, are you sure about this?",
        "Michelle: I need a fresh start. You know, you don't have to pretend to be sad about it.",
        "Marina: I am sad.",
        "Michelle: Well, it'll be easier for you and Danny.",
        "Marina: True, but you and I are friends, Michelle. Good friends.",
        "Michelle: ( Sighs ) I... I have to move on.",
        "Marina: Can you really do that when there are still so many unanswered questions?",
        "Michelle: About?",
        "Marina: The accident and the baby.",
        "Michelle: Those questions are only in my head, Marina. I mean, everyone else seems to be pretty sure about what happened that night.",
        "Marina: Everyone except for me. I still have questions, too, Michelle. There's something about that night and the accident and the baby's birth that just doesn't make sense.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Come on. You want me to partner with Detective Loose Cannon, here?",
        "Gus: Yeah, \"Loose Cannon\" in my pants.",
        "Frank: Partners.",
        "Gus: I think it's cruel, Frank.",
        "Frank: I'm looking at it as an experiment because you guys complement each other.",
        "Gus: Frank!",
        "Frank: You see, Gus here, he kind of goes at things sideways. You attack things head-on. When you fill out your paperwork, you use the jelly from your doughnut to fill it out, and you file things in triplicate. So between the two of you, I actually think I've got the perfect cop there.",
        "Gus: Assign me to anybody. Assign me to Patterson. Detective Bo. I'll learn to live with the stink.",
        "Frank: You want to get back on the force? And do you want to continue training cadets? Well, then you better take my offer up, okay? So, I'm just going to leave the two of you to work it all out.",
        "Mallet: He got a new deodorant.",
        "Gus: What?",
        "Mallet: Detective Bo. He switched brands. It seems to be working for him.",
        "Gus: That's good.",

        "Harley: You want me to be CEO of Spaulding Enterprises. You want me to sit in the chair that you and Phillip and your father occupied? To rule the kingdom that you created? I don't think so. Unless you really have gone off the deep end.",
        "Alan: No, Harley, I do. I want you to take it because I want to sit back and watch that job chew you up and spit you out. Then, finally, Phillip will have his revenge.",
        "Harley: I'm stronger than Phillip was. I'm stronger than you are. I will survive, Alan.",
        "Alan: I'll tell you one thing that won't: Your marriage. Because there's something about that building, something about sitting in that chair. Your priorities shift, Harley. That much power can change a person.",
        "Harley: Gus and I have survived a hundred times worse than anything Spaulding Enterprises could throw our way. But if it makes you sleep better in your straitjacket to think otherwise, you be my guest.",

        "Olivia: What could they be thinking? How could they think that Harley Cooper could run a billion-dollar corporation? Call Maria in housekeeping. Tell her that the carpet in the banquet room needs to be shampooed. I mean, I don't even get it. What was the Spaulding Board thinking? What? What's next? What did I say?",

        "Olivia: I was.",
        "Ava: I'm sure you were. Look at the way you run this hotel. It's incredible. You're on top of every single detail. You have a driving concept, a vision. You're decisive. You're incredible under pressure. It's wonderful to watch you in action. You're really inspirational.",
        "Guest: Excuse me. I was told you were in charge here?",
        "Olivia: Yeah. Yeah. In fact, I own the hotel. What can I do for you?",

        "Michelle: Because it seemed very clear to me at the time, but it was in my imagination, right? It had to be. Because I thought Danny was there and we both know for a fact that Danny was with you.",
        "Marina: Okay. But someone was there, Michelle. Somebody called to report the accident.",
        "Michelle: It may be somebody who was driving by or a neighbor who witnessed the crash.",

        "Marina: This is the only way that you're going to find some closure.",
        "Michelle: Marina, I said no. Why are you doing this to me? Do you have any idea how hard this was for me to accept, that things happen the way everyone said that they did? To accept that my baby is really gone? And now you want to dredge it all up all over again?",
        "Marina: Because something about it is not right.",
        "Michelle: Okay, what? What is not right?",

        "Marina: Michelle, maybe you didn't leave her in the car.",
        "Michelle: I should have held on to her and never let her go. I was her mother and it was my job to protect her, and I failed! I failed her! I should have died that night in that car! Not her! It should have been me! It should have been me.",

You're going to find out that, well, Mallet's kind of a hell of a guy. He's a great guy. And you're going to begin to understand why Harley fell in love with me and why it was so hard for her to get over me...",

        "Mallet: Tell me about it. You know, um, I might be willing to try this partner thingy, maybe. But it'd purely have to be on a temporary basis.",
        "Gus: We could do it for a little while and make Frank think we're partners, and then we could split up.",
        "Mallet: Then we could split up, okay. I could go with that. That's a good deal. Just don't get too attached to me.",

If you want to leave town, I can't stop you, but at least answer those questions before you go so that you can leave with some sort of peace. Don't you think you deserve that?

        "Harley: Now, as for what he said, he's wrong. Because you know what? The Spaulding's are awesome. And your daddy was a Spaulding. And your great-aunt Alex is a Spaulding. And Lizzie and James and Roxy. And Gus is a Spaulding, and we sure like him, don't we?",
        "Zach: Mm-hmm.",

        "Alan: Look, all I'm saying, Rick...",
