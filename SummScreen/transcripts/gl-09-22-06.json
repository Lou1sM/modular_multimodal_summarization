        "Billy: Reva? ",
        "Reva: I'm still here. You were supposed to wake me up. Oh, Billy, look at the \r\ntime. ",
        "Billy: Hey, don't worry about it. You can wash my car later. Bad day? ",
        "Reva: It feels like it might be. ",
        "Billy: Well then, you just lay here and you rest. ",
        "Reva: No, no, no, no, just give me a few minutes to get it together. I'll be \r\nfine. ( Knock on door ) ",
        "Cassie: Billy, hi. I'm sorry to bother you. It's kind of weird even just \r\nbeing here, but I didn't know where else to go. ",
        "Billy: What's wrong? ",
        "Cassie: It's Josh. He's missing. ",
        "",
        "Josh: Reva Shayne Lewis... Lewis... Lewis! You come slamming in and out of my \r\nlife whenever you damn well please. First you make me want you more and then you \r\npush me towards your sister. Cassie Winslow. Cassie Winslow. I understand your \r\nscared. I get it. It get it, Cassie, but we've come too far for you to turn back \r\nnow. You've got to stop flip- flopping. You've got to stop flip- flopping. \r\nYou've got to stop flip- flopping. ",

        "Coop: Ava? ",
        "Ava: Present. Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you up. ",
        "Coop: No, please, the sound of computer keys in the morning, I love it. \r\nWhat's that, Spaulding business? ",
        "Ava: No. I woke up this morning and I've been thinking about my mom, so I \r\nthought maybe I'd try to organize some of my thoughts. ",
        "Coop: You're writing her a letter? ",
        "Ava: Must have gotten that from you. Yeah, you know, I thought maybe it could \r\nbring me some clarity, some.... ",
        "Coop: About Olivia? ",
        "Ava: Being a good mother was more important than anything to my mom. ",
        "Coop: Except you're not Emma\u2019s mother. ",
        "Ava: I know that. But if I testify against Olivia and she goes to jail, I'm \r\ntaking Emma\u2019s mother away from her. Little girls need to be protected. ",
        "Coop: So do big girls, too. ",
        "Ava: Coop... ",
        "Coop: Look, Ava, I get that you want Emma to be safe and happy. All right, so \r\ndo I, but did you ever think that perhaps Olivia is a bigger threat to Emma than \r\nshe really is to you? I mean, wouldn't it be safer and easier to protect Emma if \r\nOlivia wasn't in her life? Maybe sending Olivia to jail might be the best gift \r\nthat you can give that little girl. ",
        "",
        "Olivia: Thanks for the ride, Officer Gorilla. ",
        "Frank: Thank you, Officer. Tell your chief I owe him one. ",
        "Cop: Will do. ",
        "Olivia: What the hell was going on? ",
        "Frank: Were you able to drop Emma off at the babysitter's? ",
        "Olivia: Yeah, Officer Meathead let me drop her off, but he didn't say why he \r\nbrought me here. Am I under arrest? ",
        "Frank: No, not yet. Olivia, I'm going to do everything in my power to protect \r\nyou, but you have to answer some questions for me. ",
        "Olivia: Questions? ",
        "Frank: I overheard Ava tell Coop that you tried to run her over in your car. \r\nShe said you looked her right in the eye and you stepped on the gas. ",
        "Olivia: That... that's insane. ",
        "Frank: I know this isn't news for you, but she also told me that she told you \r\nshe was to press charges against you once Emma got better. So what did you do \r\nonce she was released? You left town. ",
        "Olivia: On vacation. ",
        "Frank: You know, Olivia, if it turns out that you did indeed try to hurt Ava, \r\nand you ran away, you're going to be in a whole lot more trouble than I could \r\npossible get you out of. ",
        "",
        "Buzz: She's in there, isn't she, Frank? The sitter called me. ",
        "Frank: Look, we haven't charged her with anything yet. ",
        "Buzz: You tapped my phone? ",
        "Frank: Look, Pop, I overheard your conversation with her, okay? ",
        "Buzz: So you followed me, that's how you got the number? It was a private \r\nconversation, Frank. ",
        "Frank: Ava honestly believes that Olivia tried to run her over. I had to look \r\ninto it. ",
        "Buzz: And run around my back in the process, right? ",
        "Frank: So if I could have just come out and asked you for the number, you \r\nwould have given it to me, Pop? ",
        "Buzz: I want to see her, Frank. ",
        "Frank: That's not a good idea. ",
        "Buzz: Well, unless it's against the law. Is she under arrest, Frank. Is it an \r\nofficial arrest? ",
        "Frank: No, not yet. ",
        "Buzz: Then open the door. Open the door, Frank, or I'll make it ugly. I mean \r\nlawyers, everything. I mean it. Hi. ",
        "Olivia: Hey. I'm so glad to see you. ",
        "Buzz: Well, you might not feel that way for long, because I'm going to ask \r\nyou a lot of the same things he asked you. Let's start with the most obvious \r\nquestion. Did you try to run Ava down? ",
        "",
        "Coop: Ava, look, I do not mean to make things harder for you than they \r\nalready are. ",
        "Ava: I know, I know. Okay? I'm just confused. Hearing you talk about toxic \r\nOlivia and Emma... and the truth of the matter is I'm the only person who's hurt \r\nthat child until now. ",
        "Coop: No, no, it's not you, okay? That was an accident, but what Olivia tried \r\nto do to you the other night, that was not. You know that. ",
        "Ava: Yeah, I do. I know. ",
        "Coop: Ava, look, I don't know what your mom would tell you to do about \r\nOlivia, okay? I can't begin to guess, but what I think she would say about you \r\nyourself is that you need to give yourself a little bit of a break. ",
        "Ava: Do you know what she used to say to me sometimes? She would call me \r\nWendy worry. ",
        "Coop: Wendy worry? ",
        "Ava: And she would kiss me in the middle of my forehead and she would say, \r\n\"Come on, Ava, lighten up.\" ",
        "Coop: Lighten up? Okay. I guess I should probably keep that in mind, then, \r\nfor next time, huh? ",
        "Ava: Maybe you should. ",
        "Coop: Maybe I should. Maybe I will. ",
        "Ava: You should. ",
        "Coop: Okay. When Emma was in the hospital, all right, Olivia was not the only \r\nperson who was worried sick and a wreck about the situation. Ava, you were too. \r\nBut you know what? Emma is better, so you've got to let this go, please. ",
        "Ava: I don't know if I can let it go, that's the thing about... ",
        "Coop: Stop, stop. ",
        "Ava: She's in the my face all the time. ",
        "Coop: I understand that, stop. You're working yourself up, okay? Don\u2019t. You \r\ndon't have to make a decision right now. There's no need to. I'm not asking you \r\nto. What I'm just asking you to do is to take a breath and relax. Take a step \r\nback. ",
        "Ava: You're right. You're right, you're right. Now that Emma\u2019s out of the \r\nhospital, I've got to let go, right? ",
        "Coop: Yes, you do, yeah. You know what? ",
        "Ava: What? ",
        "Coop: I'm pretty good at helping people let go. ",
        "Ava: Oh, yeah? ",
        "Coop: Uh-huh. Hey, psst. ",
        "Ava: What? ",
        "Coop: Over here, Wendy worry. ",

        "Billy: When was the last time that you saw him? ",
        "Cassie: He's not at home, he's not answering his phone, he's not returning \r\nmessages. ",
        "Billy: Did you try him at work? Sometimes he get buried down there. ",
        "Cassie: No, he's not there. All Wanda would tell me is that he's on a short \r\nleave. Short leave to another planet, maybe, I don't know. But I was just hoping \r\nthat you would know something. ",
        "Billy: Hey, I'm about the last person... he and I aren't exactly great \r\nfriends right now. ",
        "Cassie: I know, I know. I was just hoping you'd know. ",
        "Billy: I'm sorry. ",
        "Reva: Maybe I can help. Come on in, Cassie. Didn't you have a meeting that \r\nyou had to go to or something? ",
        "Billy: Yeah, exactly. Okay, good luck. ",
        "Cassie: Well, I didn't realize you were here. ",
        "Reva: Well, you didn't ask. ",
        "Cassie: I just figured that Billy was more likely to be in touch with Josh \r\nand I didn't want to pull you into it. ",
        "Reva: Cassie, we're still sisters. If you need help, you can come to.... ",
        "Cassie: This isn't just help, Reva. It's Josh. ",

        "Gillespie: Ms. Spencer, sorry to keep leaving messages but about that young \r\nlady you got a problem with, I haven't heard nothing from you, so I'm still \r\nguessing I got your green light to make that problem go away. All I got to do is \r\nfind the girl and that shouldn't take too long. I'll be in touch. Morning. Can I \r\nget a coffee, please? Black. ",
        "Ashlee: Sure. ",
        "Gillespie: There's a pretty young lady who used to work here. I think her \r\nnames begins with an \"A.\" Is she still around. ",

        "Gillespie: That's it, Ava. ",
        "Ashlee: Yeah, she's the pretty young girl everyone is talking about. She was \r\nsupposed to work shifts but then some crisis came up, and who had to fill in for \r\nher but me, of course. She's gorgeous. Legs up to here, don't even get me \r\nstarted on her... never mind, you don't need to hear all this junk. ",

        "Josh: What the hell are you doing here? Well, you remember when you were \r\nabout 15.... ",
        "Josh: Oh, God. ",
        "Billy: Hey, H.P. chewed you out for taking his Cadillac, going over to see \r\nReva and you went off to the woods, built yourself a shed. You were mad, you \r\nwere pounding, so I picked all the Lewis sites and I figured I would just wait \r\nuntil I heard you pounding. ",
        "Josh: All right, all right. Who sent you here? Was it Cassie or was it Reva?\r\n",
        "Billy: Nobody sends me anywhere. ",
        "Josh: Yeah, right. And just for the record, I am not angry. I am confused. I \r\nam frustrated beyond belief but I am not angry. ",
        "Billy: Yeah, well, obviously I couldn't mistake that. ",
        "Josh: What are you doing? ",
        "Billy: I'm going to take out some of my frustrations, put hinges on this door \r\nso I can shut you out. ",
        "Josh: Have you ever wondered what it would have been like if we had never had \r\nany Shayne\u2019s come into our lives? ",
        "Billy: It would have been a lot more boring. ",
        "Josh: Yeah, but you know what? It might have been more sane, too, because \r\nthese sisters, these two incredible sisters, these beautiful, strong-willed, \r\nincredibly capable sisters have now succeeded in driving me completely and \r\nutterly insane. ",

        "Buzz: No, I just want to know what happened. ",
        "Olivia: What happened? Okay, I'll tell you what happened. I was set up by \r\nAva. She just happened to be jabbering about this heinous thing that I \r\nsupposedly did at the very moment that Frank hears what's going on... I mean, \r\ncome on, she's trying to ruin my life. ",
        "Buzz: I don't care what Ava did or did not do. I'm here about you. So, tell \r\nme yes or no. Did you deliberately step on the gas when you saw Ava in front of \r\nyour car? ",
        "Olivia: I don't really understand what happened. I... I hadn't slept in days. \r\nI was drinking, I was exhausted and fuzzy and then all of a sudden she was \r\nstanding there, the very woman who tried to destroy my life. ",
        "Buzz: You could have killed her. My son loves her. What if you had killed \r\nher? And then the voices inside of you would have been quieted? Your sense of \r\njustice would've been satisfied? ",
        "Olivia: No, no, but I didn\u2019t. I didn't kill her. All I can say is that I \r\nwasn't in my right mind that night. ",

        "Billy: And the rest of the time? ",
        "Josh: The rest of the time... well, let me see. Let me put it this way, all \r\nright? Our relationship would be perfect if it weren't for the fact that that \r\nshe's Reva\u2019s sister, or if we lived in some kind of a bubble somewhere-- that \r\nwould be good-- but that's not really reality, is it? So every time there's even \r\na mention of me and Reva, Cassie panics and she runs away. ",

        "Josh: No, no, I don't blame her at all, but it just makes me a little bit \r\ncrazy, too. So I got both sisters giving me like a double dose of crazy all the \r\ntime, 24/7, which is exactly why I came here, Billy, so I could try to just get \r\nrid of all of that, get it all out of my system, you know?

        "Reva: Well, like I said, I'm okay with it. I have a new address. ",

        "Cassie: Reva, I appreciate you trying to keep the peace in this family, but I \r\ngot to tell you, to me, it kind of seems forced, almost faked, actually. I'm \r\nsorry, but that's just the truth. ",
        "Reva: I know that it does seem like a strange situation for everyone \r\ninvolved, but, you know, I've been around long enough to know that in this world \r\nanything is possible, and if I say that it's okay if you and Josh to be together \r\nI'm sure that's strange coming out of my mouth, but...

        "Cassie: But Reva, you have fought for everything you've ever wanted in your \r\nlife. Are you telling me you're just going to give up on this suddenly? ",

        "Cassie: You make it sound as if it's as easy as swapping place cards at the \r\nLewis Christmas dinner. It isn\u2019t. Look at how awkward it is for us just to be in \r\nthe same room together. ",
        "Reva: These changes are going to be odd for all of us, but I don't care. ",

Well, maybe if Frank and Harley told Coop it would have broken some \r\nkind of police code of ethics, which is reason enough not to fill you in, \r\nconsidering that bunch, but I pay my man inside the police department enough \r\nthat he has no ethical problems keeping me well informed.

        "Reva: I've already got it figured out. They're going to need each other once \r\nI'm gone, them and the kids. It's just hard, Billy, it's just really hard. ",
        "Billy: Well, you know I hate to add to your misery here, but Josh kind of let \r\nme know that he is swearing off women altogether for right now. ",
