        "Sandy: Oh. Fun. Mail again. ",
        "Reva: What are you doing? ",
        "Sandy: Uh... ",
        "Joey: Tammy, I've got to talk to you. It's about me and lizzie and... ",
        "Tammy: And what? ",
        "Joey: Have you been drinking? Is someone else here? ",
        "Tammy: I had a couple of beers, yeah. So what? ",
        "Joey: Are you okay? ",
        "Tammy: Now, hold it. Hold it. Okay, you didn't come here to talk, not really. \r\nYou came here to talk about us, right? ",
        "Joey: Tammy, I came here to... ",
        "Tammy: So, that's what we'll do. And I'll go first. ",
        "Blake: Hey, daddy, it's me again. Chrissie. Look, would you call me back? I \r\ntried calling amanda and her secretary said that she moved to italy four months \r\nago? Good riddance. Of course, I can't believe you didn't tell me. Anyway, your \r\nletter said that you were coming into springfield, I think today, but it didn't \r\ngive me a time or where you were staying and do you need anything from me? I \r\nmean, can I make a reservation for you? Pick you up at the airport or... can I \r\ndo anything for you? I mean, other than what you asked me to do in your letter. \r\nOh, daddy, I'm so glad you're coming. There's a lot going on here right now and \r\nI really need you. I love you. Ugh. ",
        "Jeffrey: What are you doing, edmund? Making sure that dinah is really gone?\r\n",
        "Edmund: If ross weren't mayor, he would have gotten a speeding ticket for how \r\nfast he drove his daughter out of here. ",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, maybe he just wanted to get her out of here because \r\nsomeone might pinch him and wake him up. ",
        "Edmund: Well, one man's dream is another man's nightmare, i suppose. ",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well it certainly isn't your nightmare, is it? I mean, I was \r\nwatching you when cassie made her statement. You seemed deeply relieved. ",
        "Edmund: Well, you didn't seem entirely unhappy about the outcome yourself. Of \r\ncourse, that's no surprise considering dinah is holding the secret of your \r\nlittle stint as richard's undercover double over your head. ",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, it would have been a long, ugly trial, right edmund? And \r\nthe whole point of the matter was to spare cassie the ordeal of having to relive \r\nhart's death yet again in court. ",
        "Edmund: That was the theory of the idea, at least. ",
        "Jeffrey: Well, then, I'm happy that we could avoid a trial, and I'm happy for \r\nher. ",
        "Ross: So, what's going on? Where's dinah? ",
        "Jeffrey: She's with you. ",
        "Edmund: You picked her up and drove away. I saw the car myself. ",
        "Ross: What are you talking about? I just got here. ",
        "Dinah: My god, would you slow down? Please? ",
        "Cassie: It's okay. I know this road well. ",
        "Dinah: Where are we going? ",
        "Cassie: To talk. Is something wrong? ",
        "Dinah: Yeah. I thought you were my father when I got in the car. I thought \r\nthat maybe... ",
        "Cassie: You thought what? That it was over because I made a statement and you \r\nwere just going to walk away? No. That is not how it's going to happen. ",
        "Ross: Jeffrey, I drove around the entire block. Dinah is not outside. ",
        "Jeffrey: Terrific. ",
        "Ross: I don't understand this. ",
        "Edmund: Well, there are two things to come to grips with: Your daughter is \r\nnowhere to be found, and cassie is not answering her cell phone. ",
        "Jeffrey: Edmund, didn't you say that you saw dinah get into ross's car and \r\nspeed away? ",
        "Edmund: I saw the taillights of a car as it sped away. I didn't see who was \r\ninside; it was too dark. ",
        "Ross: But you assumed that dinah got in. ",
        "Edmund: I also assumed you were behind the wheel. Obviously, I'm an idiot and \r\nall bets are off right now, aren't they? ",
        "Jeffrey: Take it easy. Let's just all take it easy here, okay? ",
        "Edmund: Okay, hold on, hold on. Maybe... maybe... maybe... maybe cassie \r\nturned off her cell phone when she came in here and when she left, she was too \r\nupset to turn it back on, so... maybe she's gotten home by now... ",
        "Ross: So, when did cassie leave here? ",
        "Edmund: And exactly when, because I went to look for tammy. When I came back, \r\ncassie was gone. ",
        "Jeffrey: Well, she would have made it back to the farm by now. ",
        "Edmund: Come on, come on, cassie. Pick up. (Telephone ringing) ",
        "Tammy: Joey, the way I see it... I mean, the way I feel... (telephone \r\nringing) well, what I'm trying to say... ugh. What? ",
        "Edmund: I'm trying to get hold of your mother. ",
        "Tammy: She's not here. ",
        "Edmund: Did she call or leave a message she was on the way? ",
        "Tammy: No. Is something wrong? ",
        "Edmund: No, no. No, nothing's wrong. I just need to find your mother, tammy. \r\nWe're, um... we're going away tonight. We've planned a little trip and I just \r\nwanted to firm up the details with her. ",
        "Tammy: She didn't say anything about a trip. ",
        "Edmund: Well, it was a spur of the moment kind of thing. Just... when she \r\ncalls, tammy, or comes back, can you just have her get in touch with me, please? \r\nIt's important. ",
        "Tammy: Okay. ",
        "Edmund: You promise you'll tell her, right? ",
        "Tammy: I said I would. That was weird. ",
        "Joey: What was that about? ",
        "Tammy: I don't know. ",
        "Edmund: She's not there and there's no word from her. So, what do the facts \r\ntell us now? ",
        "Jeffrey: Well, they tell us that we have to consider the possibility that \r\ncassie may have been abducted by dinah. ",
        "Dinah: Will you stop this car right now, please? ",
        "Cassie: Soon. We're almost there. ",
        "Dinah: We are driving awfully fast and awfully far for just a talk, cassie.\r\n",
        "Cassie: Relax, dinah. We're not going to cross the state line. Plus, you know \r\nme. I like things to work out, people to get along. It must be the mom in me.\r\n",
        "Dinah: What is left to talk about? ",
        "Cassie: Oh, there's a lot of things to talk about, because you're not going \r\nto jail now. And let's say you stay in springfield, how are we going to coexist \r\nin the same town, with our history? ",
        "Dinah: I don't know. ",
        "Cassie: Yeah, well. See? There's a lot to talk about. ",
        "Dinah: Okay, if you are so concerned about coexisting, why did you not bring \r\nthis up before? ",
        "Cassie: As opposed to when? ",
        "Dinah: At the police station, when you made your statement to jeffrey. I \r\nthought maybe you'd want to stick around, see if things could turn out before \r\nyou have to change your story. ",
        "Cassie: You mean, when I gave you your \"get out of jail free\" card? ",
        "Dinah: I would think that the mommy in you would want some guarantee that \r\neverybody could get along. ",
        "Cassie: I was tempted. I was tempted to have this conversation at the police \r\nstation, but then I knew we couldn't have the discussion honestly and openly, \r\nso... ",
        "Dinah: Why not? ",
        "Cassie: Because, dinah, you would have been picking and choosing every single \r\nthing that came out of your mouth to make me change my mind and tell jeffrey \r\neverything that really happened. ",
        "Dinah: You are serious about this. ",
        "Cassie: Spending time alone with you is the last thing i want to do. ",
        "Dinah: Yeah, but here we are. We are all alone. ",
        "Cassie: Yes. Here we are. Because we have to get to a place where we \r\nunderstand each other, some place where we're on neutral ground and we can talk \r\nopenly. Where hart's ghost isn't hovering over us. ",
        "Dinah: Okay, did you really think I wouldn't open up unless you kidnapped me?\r\n",
        "Cassie: I took a huge chance on you tonight, dinah, and now i have to make \r\nsure I made the right choice. And I only have one shot at it, and then you can \r\nfinally, really be free. So sit back. We're almost there. ",
        "Tammy: My mom's not answering her cell. ",
        "Joey: Okay, well, don't you think he would have tried her on her cell before \r\nhe tried here? ",
        "Tammy: I don't know! I'm just... I'm trying to figure out why he was so \r\nfreaked. And it can't be about a stupid trip. Or maybe it is and I'm just... ",
        "Joey: What? ",
        "Tammy: Making a bigger deal out of it than it is because i don't know how to \r\nsay what i want to say to you. ",
        "Joey: No, tammy. Look, you don't owe me any explanations. I know you're mad \r\nat me. ",
        "Tammy: Mad and all kinds of things, joey. God, I am all screwed up because of \r\nyou. ",
        "Joey: I know. You feel like I totally betrayed you. ",
        "Tammy: Well, you did. ",
        "Joey: Tammy, there's more to it than that. ",
        "Tammy: You're right. I don't think all this stuff that I've been doing is \r\nbecause of how much you hurt me. Because it hurts even more not to be with you. \r\nAnd I don't want to hurt anymore, joey. ",
        "Reva: This whole mother and son thing is new to us, but we will get it, I \r\npromise, because I will remember that you are a grownup and if you ask me to \r\nback off, I will. ",
        "Sandy: Really? ",
        "Reva: Well, I'll try. That is, as long as you promise to tell me if you have \r\na problem or something that I can help you with. ",
        "Sandy: There is one thing. ",
        "Reva: Oh, good. Name it. ",
        "Sandy: Well, I'm ravenous. Who do you got to know to get some food in this \r\nplace? ",
        "Reva: (Laughs) well, I do happen to have an in. You see, I was married to \r\nthe owner at one time. So, good. We'll eat something and then we'll get to work.\r\n",
        "Sandy: All right. On what? ",
        "Reva: On the feature for my show that we were talking about. You know, the \r\ndynamics of families who adopt? ",
        "Sandy: I thought we were doing the one on the rock the vote project. ",
        "Reva: Well, yeah. We can do both. I'd love to see what information you've \r\ngotten together for that. ",
        "Sandy: Oh, I... I don't have that completely fleshed out just yet. ",
        "Reva: In other words, butt out. That's fine. We'll go back to plan \"A.\" I met \r\nthis terrific woman. Her name is gloria and she has an adopted son and she's \r\nagreed to do a pre-interview for us. ",
        "Sandy: Really? When? ",
        "Reva: Ooh, actually she's going to meet us here in about ten minutes, so I \r\nsuggest that we get cracking and get our homework done. ",
        "Sandy: Okay. ",
        "Reva: This was the... what I'm looking at as far as openings. ",
        "Tammy: As mad as I am and i am mad-- madder than I've ever been at anybody in \r\nmy life-- i can't hate you... ",
        "Joey: But I... ",
        "Tammy: Slept with lizzie. I know. I know. And I hate that. After I told you \r\nthat I never wanted to see you again, I kept thinking about you. And lizzie. ",
        "Joey: What do you mean? ",
        "Tammy: I've known her for a lot longer than you have, joey. And I know the \r\nkind of stuff that she can pull when she wants something. Or someone. She'll \r\nmanipulate them and jerk them around and hurt them. And the whole time she still \r\nthink she's being your friend. ",
        "Joey: Yeah, it's pretty scary. ",
        "Tammy: Lizzie tried to come between us for a long time, joey. Because she \r\nwanted to be your girlfriend. And all of a sudden you slept with her? Why should \r\nI think that that's just some sickening coincidence? Joey, what if she some how \r\ntricked you into it? ",
        "Joey: Tricked me? ",
        "Tammy: Set you up. You kept saying that you don't remember what happened that \r\nnight. ",
        "Joey: Yeah, and you thought i was lying to you. ",
        "Tammy: Yeah, I did. But what if someone did get you drunk, joey? Or how about \r\nthis? Gave you some kind of drug. What if it was lizzie? ",
        "Lizzie: Joey, I put something in your drink, but listen. I didn't do it \r\nknowing that you would forget everything that happened between us. I just did it \r\nfor fun, okay. ",
        "Tammy: Is any of that night coming back to you? Please tell me that it is. \r\nTell me that lizzie somehow made you sleep with her. Please. I want to blame \r\nher, joey. ",
        "Joey: If I told you the truth, would you believe me? ",
        "Tammy: Yes. It still hurts to know that you spent the night sleeping next to \r\nsome other girl. Especially lizzie. But I would try really hard to get past it. \r\nEspecially if it meant getting back what we had together, joey. We were so great \r\ntogether. I loved you. Please tell me I don't have to throw that away. ",
        "Lizzie: You don't have to go. Okay, just promise my dad you won't tell \r\nanybody about me drugging you. ",
        "Joey: What? And just forget all that happened, lizzie? ",
        "Lizzie: Well, he's serious. I mean he really will send you away and take your \r\nmom's house away. ",
        "Ross: I think I'm going to call blake, see if she's at the beacon. ",
        "Jeffrey: You do that. That's a good idea. ",
        "Edmund: The beacon? The beacon?! What, do you think dinah stopped by olivia's \r\nbar for a celebratory shot and a beer? ",
        "Jeffrey: Of course not. She's in that car with cassie. But you and ross going \r\nat each other isn't going to help matters, is it? ",
        "Edmund: You're so proud of yourself, mr. O'neill. You brought cassie along so \r\nartfully, so skillfully. Now she may be beyond everyone's help. ",
        "Jeffrey: What are you talking about? ",
        "Edmund: You made it so convenient for her to change her story about hart's \r\nmurder. You know, one would think you planned it this way along. ",
        "Jeffrey: Edmund, cassie's statement was 100% her decision. ",
        "Edmund: Of course it was. After you drilled into her just how awful the trial \r\nwas going to be for her and her family, and by inference how much easier her \r\nlife was going to be if she didn't testify against dinah. ",
        "Jeffrey: I didn't twist her arm. It was her call, edmund. ",
        "Edmund: You also didn't tell cassie the real reason you didn't want the case \r\nto go to trial. ",
        "Jeffrey: My so-called agenda. Is that it? ",
        "Edmund: Dinah, would have gone public with the fact that you were secretly \r\nimpersonating richard. ",
        "Jeffrey: Come on. I don't even have time for this. ",
        "Edmund: Make it. Cassie would have believed it, too. And she would have been \r\nso disgusted by you, she would have turned against you forever. ",
        "Jeffrey: Edmund... ",
        "Edmund: And you couldn't have risked that, given your feelings for her. ",
        "Jeffrey: Back off! ",
        "Edmund: So you had to keep dinah quiet, didn't you? And this is how you did \r\nit. You steered cassie just enough to make her decide to change her story. You \r\nhad all the angles covered, didn't you, mr. O'neill? All of them except one. You \r\ndidn't know how to keep cassie safe. Because of that she may be dead right now. \r\nAnd you know what? I should return the favor. ",
        "Dinah: So this is your neutral territory, huh? ",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Perfect, isn't it? No one knows we're here. Not a house around \r\nfor miles. No one to interrupt us. ",
        "Dinah: Well, you certainly thought of everything. ",
        "Cassie: Yes, I have. Now we can say all the things that we've been wanting to \r\nsay. We can scream at the top of our lungs and no one's going to hear us. ",
        "Dinah: Cassie, I don't want to scream at you. ",
        "Cassie: You say that now. ",
        "Dinah: I want to move on with my life. I want to move on with the life that \r\nyou gave me back. ",
        "Cassie: That's good. See, that's good. It sounds like you've changed, like \r\nyou turned over a new leaf. ",
        "Dinah: I have. And, quite honestly, this location, the woods, this is not \r\nvery liberating to me. A place like this gives me the creeps. ",
        "Cassie: I can understand. ",
        "Dinah: What is this? ",
        "Cassie: It's a .22 semi- automatic. I keep it at the farm. I've been looking \r\nat it a lot since you showed up. ",
        "Dinah: You said you wanted to talk. ",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I did, didn't I? ",
        "Dinah: You said you wanted to work things out. ",
        "Cassie: I lied. ",
        "Coming up on \"guiding ",
        "light\"... ",
        "Reva: Sandy's not my son. He's an imposter. ",
        "Ross: I think I should just go over to the beacon, see if blake and dinah or \r\nboth of them are there. ",
        "Edmund: There's no answer at the farm. I'm going over there. ",
        "Jeffrey: I'm going with you. That's not debatable. ",
        "Dinah: Go ahead. Shoot me. oprah: The woodchopper and the mill ",
        "Tammy: Joey, say something. ",
        "Joey: I don't know how to start. ",
        "Tammy: Well, if it makes you feel any better, this is all coming as a \r\nsurprise to me, too. I had no clue I was going to say all this stuff. But every \r\nword is true. And I think what you said about us is true, too. ",
        "Joey: What'd I say? ",
        "Tammy: That it was wrong of me to just walk away from what we... joey, tell \r\nme you still feel the same. ",
        "Lizzie: You can stay and your ",
        "mom will be able to keep her ",
        "house. ",
        "You're going to have to... ",
        "Joey: What? ",
        "Lizzie, take an oath of silence ",
        "and be your boyfriend? ",
        "No, thanks. ",
        "I don't ever want to see you ",
        "again. ",
        "Lizzie: Joey, wait. ",
        "That's not a good decision, ",
        "okay? ",
        "You won't be able to come back ",
        "here again. ",
        "He'll make sure of it. ",
        "Joey: You weren't wrong, tammy. I slept with lizzie. ",
        "Lizzie: I know. But you said... ",
        "Joey: I wanted to sleep with her. She didn't have to slip me drugs. She \r\ndidn't have to get me drunk or anything. No tricks. Because it was my choice.\r\n",
        "Tammy: What? You said you don't remember anything that happened that night.\r\n",
        "Joey: No, tammy, I remember every minute of it. I just pretended to forget \r\nso... so I didn't hurt you. ",
        "Tammy: No. ",
        "Joey: The bottom line is, tammy, I knew what I was doing. ",
        "Tammy: You can't just... ",
        "Joey: What? What, tammy? Just change my story like that? That morning what I \r\nfed you was the story. A big fairy tale, tammy. And this, what I'm telling you \r\nnow, this is the truth. I had sex with lizzie after i won the spaulding contest \r\nbecause I was pumped, because i wanted to celebrate. ",
        "Tammy: (Crying) we were going to celebrate. ",
        "Joey: Yeah, well, I wanted someone, and lizzie was there. So wham bam. ",
        "Tammy: Someone? ",
        "Joey: Yeah. Someone who was experienced. Someone who knew what they were \r\ndoing. That's definitely lizzie and definitely not you. ",
        "Tammy: Oh, god. ",
        "Joey: Look, tammy, I thought you should know, because it's fair. I didn't \r\nwant to leave you hanging after I was gone. ",
        "Tammy: Gone? What are you talking about? ",
        "Joey: I knew you and I were completely done and over with. Through. So I made \r\nplans. ",
        "Tammy: For? ",
        "Joey: College. A slot opened up at B.U. In boston. I'm going. You know, a \r\nchance like that happens, you just have to jump on it. ",
        "Tammy: Then why didn't you just go? Why did you have to do this to me? ",
        "Joey: You wanted the truth, okay? Now you have the truth. You shouldn't feel \r\nbad, tammy. We weren't meant to be anyway. I mean, we're two different people \r\nwho want two different things. So take care of yourself. (Tammy crying) ",
        "Reva: Thanks so much, gloria for meeting us here. This is jonathon. Well, \r\nactually he's my son, but everybody calls him sandy. And he's going to be \r\nworking on the show. ",
        "Gloria: Oh, you work with your son. That must be a dream come true. ",
        "Sandy: Actually, I'm a pain in the butt. I'm the guy who reminds reva that we \r\nhave deadlines and a production schedule. P.S., We really should get started.\r\n",
        "Reva: Oh. Okay. I guess it is a little late. So I guess the thing that I'm \r\nmost curious about are your feelings toward your adopted son. I mean, I can only \r\nimagine what they must be. ",
        "Gloria: Well, let's see how close you are. ",
        "Reva: I would think that you love that child as if he were your own, \r\ncompletely and unconditionally. ",
        "Gloria: I can't conceive of it any other way. ",
        "Reva: I guess I should ",
        "apologize. ",
        "This whole thing is a charade. ",
        "Sandy's not my son. ",
        "He's an imposter. ",
        "A fake. ",
        "A grifter. ",
        "Sandy: How do you figure ",
        "that? ",
        "Reva: Oh, I found out the ",
        "truth from your computer. ",
        "Right here. ",
        "This child here integrated ",
        "himself into our lives. ",
        "Why? ",
        "Because jonathon's entitled to ",
        "a big fat inheritance. ",
        "Can you believe what some ",
        "people will stoop to? ",
        "Gloria: He seemed so nice. ",
        "Reva: Oh, well, that's the ",
        "biggest weapon in his arsenal. ",
        "Oh, yeah. ",
        "That and the fact that he plays ",
        "on your sympathy. ",
        "Sandy: Reva, it's not... ",
        "Reva: Fooled you again, ",
        "didn't I? ",
        "You thought I was going to buy ",
        "all this hook, line and sinker. ",
        "Well, get ready. ",
        "This is where he usually cranks ",
        "up some garbage about how all ",
        "he really wanted was to be the ",
        "part of some real family. ",
        "Instead of having to deal with ",
        "all the stuff he had to deal ",
        "with being raised by his low ",
        "life parents who raised him. ",
        "Tune up the violins. ",
        "I could hear him coming. ",
        "Gloria: You should be ashamed ",
        "of yourself. ",
        "Reva: Oh, no, but he wants us ",
        "to feel sorry for him. ",
        "When all I feel is like I'm ",
        "losing jonathon all over again! Sandy? Sandy? Are you sure you're okay? ",
        "Sandy: Everything's great. Let's get back to work. ",
        "Reva: (Laughs) okay. ",
        "Edmund: This is all your fault. You wanted dinah on the street from the \r\nbeginning. ",
        "Jeffrey: Edmund, get your hands off of me or I'm going to put you in the \r\nhospital. ",
        "Ross: All right. All right. ",
        "Jeffrey: Now! ",
        "Ross: Stop it. This is not going to solve anything. ",
        "Jeffrey: Thank you, ross. Did you speak with blake? ",
        "Ross: No, I didn'T. She's not picking up her cell phone. ",
        "Edmund: Hey, maybe dinah nabbed her, too. Why not? The car was big enough.\r\n",
        "Jeffrey: All right, why don't you get out of here if you can't start thinking \r\nrationally and behaving yourself? ",
        "Edmund: Because it's not a rational situation. And you of all people should \r\nknow that. ",
        "Ross: Why would edmund be blaming you for all of this? ",
        "Edmund: I don't know. Because I signed the release papers that set your \r\ndaughter free. Because I'm the easy target. I don't know, ross. I just wish that \r\nthis didn't happen. ",
        "Ross: Jeffrey, we don't even know what \"this\" is. I have to believe there's a \r\nsimple explanation for what's going on. You don't agree. ",
        "Jeffrey: You want me to lie to you, ross? ",
        "Ross: I think I should just go over to the beacon, see if blake and dinah or \r\nboth of them are there. ",
        "Jeffrey: That's a good idea. And if you hear anything, or if you find out \r\nanything, let me know, okay? ",
        "Ross: All right. ",
        "Edmund: There's no answer at the farm. I'm going over there. ",
        "Jeffrey: I'm going with you. That's not debatable. Call me when you get to \r\nthe beacon. ",
        "Ross: I will. Please let us all be wrong. ",
        "Dinah: What would you like me to do? ",
        "Cassie: Doesn't matter to me. ",
        "Dinah: I know what you want and I'm way ahead of you. I will steer clear of \r\nyou and your family. You wouldn't even know I'm around. ",
        "Cassie: You don't know what i want, but you're about to find out fast. ",
        "Dinah: We should talk. ",
        "Cassie: It won't change anything. I know what I have to do. ",
        "Dinah: Look, what are you going to do, kill me? ",
        "Cassie: Put it this way: The alternatives wouldn't work. If I believed that \r\nyou would leave me and my family alone, i would let you go, but I don'T. So I \r\ncan'T. ",
        "Dinah: You said it yourself in the car. This is going to be an entirely new \r\nsituation. ",
        "Cassie: I also said something about co-existing, but we both know that can't \r\nhappen, right? ",
        "Dinah: Yes, it can. ",
        "Cassie: How long have you been on the run, dinah? Five years? And you have \r\nspent every minute blaming me, hating me, waiting to get back at me ever since \r\nyou murdered hart. So here we are. The moment is here. But you're on my turf \r\nnow. And I'm not going to play into your hands this time. I've learned a lot in \r\nfive years. ",
        "Dinah: The only reason I'm on your turf is because you came to the police \r\nstation, changed your story, and got me out of there. I could have been in jail.\r\n",
        "Cassie: Jail's a joke, dinah. Did a prison sentence keep you away from me? \r\nNo. Did the courts keep you away from me and my family? No. You won't stay away, \r\nso I have to make you stay away. ",
        "Dinah: Sounds like revenge to me. ",
        "Cassie: Yeah, well, it's justice. It's justice for hart, for me, my family. \r\nSee, it's good for everybody, because I'm sparing my family and my friends from \r\na long painful trial. I'm able to avoid all the nightmares rj would have if he \r\nfound out that his so-called imaginary friend gunned down his father. We've been \r\nable to prevent some defense attorney from traumatizing tammy on the witness \r\nstand. As for me, there's no way in hell I would be able to marry edmund and \r\nmove on with my life if I had to constantly look over my shoulder waiting for \r\nyour shadow to be over me again. So I know what I have to do. ",
        "Dinah: What? Kill me? ",
        "Cassie: Yeah. If I get rid of you, I get rid of your shadow. ",
        "Dinah: (Laughing) ",
        "Cassie: You think this is funny? Everyone says your crazy, but this proves \r\nit. ",
        "Dinah: You can't shoot me, cassie. I'm sorry; you can. But you won'T. ",
        "Cassie: Why won't I? ",
        "Dinah: Well, let's see. There's no way that you would pull that trigger. \r\nYou're cassie layne. Are you going to murder somebody in cold blood? No, no, no. \r\nShe was the princess. And princesses don't do that. ",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Well, I'll rise to the occasion. ",
        "Dinah: I don't think so. No, no. Because, see, you have convinced yourself \r\nover the years that you're better than I am, that you are miles above me in \r\nevery possible way. ",
        "Cassie: I am. ",
        "Dinah: Really? You're just going to blow somebody away because she gets under \r\nyour skin? Don't you think that's something I would have done? You know, come \r\ninto town with a murderous rampage? ",
        "Cassie: Maybe I want to do it first. ",
        "Dinah: Oh, okay. Okay. Go ahead. Shoot me. Come on. Told you. You can't do \r\nit. You won't do it. Because you'd rather have a pack of wild boars tear you \r\napart than rather sink to what you think my level is. ",
        "Cassie: I've changed a lot since you left springfield, dinah. You don't watch \r\npeople you love die before your eyes and not change. ",
        "Dinah: Okay. Then are you so absolutely sure that rj and tammy and edmund are \r\ngoing to go unaffected from this? You're going to put your little precious \r\nfamily through a nasty trial? Because it's going to be yours, not mine. ",
        "Cassie: Who says I'm going to get arrested? ",
        "Dinah: You think you're going to get away with something like this? ",
        "Cassie: I will if I'm car- jacked. By you. Brought to this remote location. \r\nBy you. Threatened with my own gun. By you. I had to kill you in self- defense. \r\nWho wouldn't believe that? ",
        "Dinah: You don't think they're going to figure out that's a lie? ",
        "Cassie: No one's going to be around to tell them. ",
        "Edmund: Cassie! Tammy? What the hell happened here? Tammy? ",
        "Jeffrey: Looks like a little beer party. ",
        "Edmund: This doesn't make any sense. She was here, and now she's not. Oh, \r\nman, what do we do? We let that lunatic back into cassie's life. And yes, mr. \r\nO'neill, I'm blaming myself, too. ",
        "Jeffrey: Look, dinah's been fixated on cassie for years, okay/ completely \r\nobsessed with her. I don't see how that we were suppose to... ",
        "Edmund: We were supposed to kill her. That's what we should have done. That \r\nwould have taken care of it. Now it's too late. Tammy?! Tammy?! ",
        "Ross: Blake? Where have you been? I've been looking all over town for you. \r\nAnd why aren't you picking up your phone? ",
        "Blake: Well, I've been waiting for a very important phone call, and I just \r\nlet the voice mail pick up all the rest. ",
        "Ross: Well, I wish you would have taken my call, because we have a small \r\nproblem with dinah. ",
        "Blake: She didn't break out of jail, did she? ",
        "Ross: She doesn't need to. She was released. ",
        "Blake: What? ",
        "Ross: Cassie made a statement under oath that cleared her. She said that \r\ndinah shot hart, but it was accidental. ",
        "Blake: Oh, my god! ",
        "Ross: So the charges were dropped. Dinah walks out of the police station and \r\npromptly disappears. And what's more, nobody knows where cassie is either. ",
        "Blake: Oh, ross. Dinah... dinah's going to kill cassie. ",
        "Ross: There's no proof of that. ",
        "Blake: Look, you know what? When are you going to figure out, that dinah is \r\nout of control? Look at this. Cassie gets her off scot-free and what does she \r\ndo? She repays her by kidnapping her. ",
        "Ross: There's no reason to think that she's kidnapped anybody. ",
        "Blake: I got to tell you something. You know, if my father were here this \r\nwould never happen. Dinah would never get away with this. ",
        "Ross: That's who you're waiting to hear from, isn't it? Did you call roger \r\nabout dinah? ",
        "Reva: What do you say we walk gloria out to her car on our way out? ",
        "Sandy: I think I'm going to stick around and take some notes on the stuff we \r\njust talked about. And then I have those papers you gave me on cross creek to \r\ntake over to bill. So... ",
        "Reva: Oh, great. Okay. Well, then I guess I'll see you back home later. ",
        "Sandy: Sure. D it was nice to meet you, gloria. Have a good night. ",
        "Gloria: Oh, and you, too, sandy. Thank you. ",
        "Reva: Thank you. This is so much fun working on this story together. Makes me \r\nfeel closer to you. And that is a strictly objective non-overbearing mother \r\ncomment. How about that? ",
        "Sandy: Mm-hmm. Okay. ",
        "Reva: See you later. ",
        "Sandy: Bye. ",
        "Reva: So are you parked on this side? ",
        "Gloria: Just around the corner. ",
        "Tammy: You disappeared on me. ",
        "Jb: I had things to do. ",
        "Tammy: Like look through the window at company? You didn't even say goodbye.\r\n",
        "Jb: How would you know? You were passed out. Listen, babe, I'm not going to \r\nsit alone with you and wait until your mom gets home and i can explain why her \r\nlittle baby is all passed out on the couch hammered. ",
        "Tammy: Well, my mom's not coming home. She and my uncle edmund are going out \r\nof town tonight. So no one's going to be home, except that little baby. ",
        "Jb: And why are you telling me this? ",
        "Tammy: Why do you think? ",
        "Blake: Bringing up roger in conversation and calling him are two very \r\ndifferent things, ross. ",
        "Ross: Please. I understand that. ",
        "Blake: Besides, why wouldn't I mention him when dinah's the subject? I mean, \r\nit's a perfect fit. They were married. ",
        "Ross: Yes, a marriage made in hell. Did you call roger about dinah's \r\nsituation? ",
        "Blake: No, I did not call roger about dinah. ",
        "Ross: Good. Because the last thing we need is roger making a bad situation \r\neven worse. ",
        "Jb: So, in other words, you want me to come back to your house with you? Is \r\nthat the deal here? ",
        "Tammy: Are you always like this? ",
        "Jb: How am I? ",
        "Tammy: Playing hard to get. ",
        "Jb: No, no. I'm the easiest guy in the world. But I might have other plans \r\ntonight. ",
        "Tammy: Really? More pressing than this? I think you might want to change your \r\nplans. ",
        "Sandy: It is you. ",
        "Tammy: So, you coming or what? ",
        "Jb: How could I say no/ cousin. ",
        "Jeffrey: When was that? You're sure about that? Could be confirmed? All \r\nright. Well, get back to me. Thanks. Any sign of tammy? ",
        "Edmund: None. She's gone. ",
        "Jeffrey: Well, maybe not for long. Cassie's car was spotted. Or at least one \r\nthat resembles hers to a \"T.\" ",
        "Edmund: Where? ",
        "Jeffrey: On route 12 heading towards laurel falls. The patrolman remember \r\nseeing the car because there were hardly any on the road. ",
        "Edmund: This can't be good. ",
        "Jeffrey: Look, edmund, if it is dinah, okay, and she does try something, \r\ncassie's not a pushover, right? I mean, she could handle herself, she can defend \r\nherself. ",
        "Edmund: From a bullet? We kept a gun in here. ",
        "Jeffrey: In the box lying around the house? ",
        "Edmund: We kept it locked. Dinah's got it now. ",
        "Cassie: See, I thought this through well. ",
        "Dinah: Good for you. ",
        "Cassie: I came up here to clear my head, and then the idea came to me. And \r\nthe more I thought about it, the more I thought this could work, yeah. ",
        "Dinah: Cassie, this won't work. ",
        "Cassie: Now you're scared. Because you know this will work. Who's going to \r\ndoubt me, dinah? You've tried to kill me before. You stole my identity. You \r\nstalked me and my family. You see, that's what the police would call a pattern \r\nof behavior, a would-be killer. ",
        "Dinah: Look who's got the gun in her hand now? ",
        "Cassie: But it was in yours. You stole this from my home and then you forced \r\nme into the car. You marched me up here, marched me to the edge of the cliff. \r\nYeah. What was I going to do? It was either you or me. ",
        "Dinah: You're crazy. ",
        "Cassie: No, this is the sanest thing I've ever done. Because living with the \r\nthreat that you pose to my family? That's crazy. ",
        "Dinah: Cassie, I told you this is all in the past. ",
        "Cassie: Yes, it is. And it will be in just a few minutes. ",
        "Dinah: Stop it. Stop it! ",
        "Cassie: That's what you should have done, dinah. Before you came to town, you \r\nshould have stopped. But you didn'T. You should have stayed away. But you didn'T. \r\nSo here we are at the end after all these years later. But, you know what, I \r\nhave to tell you, I kind of like this ending. ",
        "Next on \"guiding light\"... ",
        "Reva: Nothing you could say will shock me. ",
        "Sandy: What if I said that i killed somebody. ",
        "Cassie: You have ten seconds to live. That's nine more that you gave hart \r\nbefore you blew him away. "
