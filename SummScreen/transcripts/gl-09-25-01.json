        "Edmund: And that was the day I knew that Beth \r\nand I were destined to share a charmed life together. And we would live out the \r\nrest of our days as benevolent co-rulers of an island paradise. ",
        "Lorelei: Except they got themselves a \r\npresident down there now. (Laughs) ",
        "Edmund: Yeah, illegally. My half-brother \r\ncouldn't stand the idea of being out of power, so he staged a coup. In the chaos \r\nthat followed, they brainwashed my wife into believing I'd done all sorts of \r\nunspeakable things. She went down to Mexico to get a divorce. ",
        "Lorelei: And that's when you went after her.\r\n",
        "Edmund: Oh, I was this close to convincing \r\nher that our love could overcome any obstacle. But our love could not overcome a \r\nten-foot wall of water. ",
        "Lorelei: Hey, go back to that \"charmed life\" \r\npart. Was that really great? ",
        "Edmund: It was more wonderful than you could \r\npossibly imagine. Servants at our beck and call. A magnificent palace. And the \r\ncountry was ours. And we were in love. ",
        "Lorelei: So you're rich, huh? ",
        "Edmund: Rich? No. Well, I was, but... And I \r\ncould be again, if Beth's family wasn't so determined to deny me what's \r\nrightfully mine. ",
        "Lorelei: You know, I was never much into \r\nfairy tales, but I sure could handle being a princess. Diamonds and furs and \r\nlimos. Hey, you know, first thing I'd do is I'd go back to Virginia and show \r\nthem hometown folks just how special I turned out. I bet I could be just as good \r\na princess as that... That Bess. ",
        "Edmund: Beth. ",
        "Lorelei: Okay, I'm sorry. They'd be bowing to \r\nme, and... What are you staring at? ",
        "Edmund: I'm not sure. ",
        "Lorelei: Well, there's a great answer. \r\n",
        "Edmund: Oh, my god. I think it could work.\r\n",
        "",
        "Rick: Whew. I'm so glad to see you. I just \r\nfinished a 48-hour stint in E.R. And I'm a doctor, and I am prescribing some \r\nmajor coffee here, okay? I'm not talking about your average cup of Joe, okay? \r\nWe're talking about the Cuban stuff. Why don't you break out the Cuban stuff? So \r\nbring me a Grande and just keep it flowing, pal. Just keep it coming. \r\n",
        "Bartender: There's going to be a little wait.\r\n",
        "Rick: A wait? For what? ",
        "Bartender: I have to brew some more. \r\n",
        "Rick: Brew some more? Carl, this place is \r\nempty. Where's the coffee? You've got to have some coffee. Come on. ",
        "Bartender: She took the last cup. ",
        "Rick: She what... There seems to be a theme \r\nrunning through my life right now. I mean, every time my life just gets a little \r\ndifficult, there you are. You question me at work, fine. Complain to the \r\ndepartment head about me, I can live with that. But drink the last of my coffee? \r\nUh-uh. ",
        "",
        "Remy: Co-ed, meaning co- educational. \r\n",
        "Josh: Yeah, I know. I understand that, but I \r\nwant you to explain to me how it is that putting men, women, and beer together \r\nunder the same roof makes for a good educational experience. ",
        "Marah: Dad! ",
        "Josh: What? ",
        "Remy: It's okay. I take it you're Marah.\r\n",
        "Marah: Yeah. ",
        "Remy: I'm Remy Boudreaux. ",
        "Marah: Nice to meet you. ",
        "Josh: Yeah. Remy's a sophomore. He's on the \r\norientation committee-- have I got that right? ",
        "Remy: I was assigned to this floor to help \r\nyou with any problems or questions. ",
        "Marah: Yeah, well I guess you got both of \r\nthose here. ",
        "Josh: Hey, look, it's not like I'm a prude or \r\nanything like that. But see, it's a little shocking for me to have, like a half- \r\nnaked guy appear at my daughter's doorstep when she's only ten minutes into her \r\ncollege career. ",
        "Marah: A half-naked guy? Was he cute? Where \r\ndid he go? ",
        "Josh: Marah. Marah, sweetheart, you get my \r\npoint. ",
        "Marah: I know exactly what you mean. Now, I \r\nknow you guys have already met, but let me formally introduce you. Remy \r\nBoudreaux, this is my father, Josh Lewis, who I feel was born in the 18th \r\ncentury. ",
        "Josh: Nice to meet you.",

        "Reva: It's open, Daphne. ",
        "Holly: Guess again. ",
        "Reva: Holly. What are you doing here? \r\n",
        "Holly: How did I find you, you mean? You \r\nalways leave word where your producer can reach you, remember? ",
        "Reva: And you are my producer. ",
        "Holly: Yeah. And when you left Springfield, I \r\nwondered what could you find around here that would be preferable to a spa in \r\nChicago. I must be a really bad date. ",
        "Reva: No, no. It's nothing personal, and I \r\nwouldn't have been such a great date myself. I just needed some time alone.\r\n",
        "Holly: Uh-huh. Well, I wasn't alone in \r\nChicago after all. Buzz was there. ",
        "Reva: In Chicago? ",
        "Holly: Yeah. ",
        "Reva: You asked him to come after all? \r\n",
        "Holly: No, he just showed up. And we had \r\ngreat fun heckling Edmund, believe it or not. ",
        "Reva: Edmund. ",
        "Holly: Edmund has a lounge act in a hotel in \r\nChicago. More later. Anyway, I should have been furious at him for just assuming \r\nhe could join me there, but I was not. ",
        "Reva: Because? Come on, details. ",
        "Holly: There are none. ",
        "Reva: Wait a minute. A man who almost \r\nconstantly annoys you pays you a surprise visit in Chicago, and there are no \r\ndetails? ",
        "Holly: Well, he did not annoy me; I'll say \r\nthat much. Maybe because I think it was such a sweet gesture of him to come. \r\nNow, I realize he has been practically throwing himself at me for... ",
        "Reva: For months. For months he has. And you \r\nhaven't given him an inch. Is that because of Billy? ",
        "Holly: No. I don't think so. Billy and I are \r\nnot a couple. ",
        "Reva: Huh. ",
        "Holly: I like them both. ",
        "Reva: There's nothing wrong with that. \r\n",
        "Holly: No, nothing, I guess. I can hear Buzz. \r\nHe tells me I have to stop and ask myself why I keep running away from life and \r\nmen. ",
        "Reva: Well, that's a good question. ",
        "Holly: Not just for me. What about you? What \r\nare you running away from? ",
        "Reva: Nothing. ",
        "Holly: Oh, come on. You hole up in this place \r\nin the middle of nowhere. This is not about having a time off. This is about \r\nisolating yourself, cutting off the world. Mm-hmm. Now, the Reva Shayne I know \r\nwould never do this, so why is this happening now? ",
        "",
        "Cassie: Hello? Hello? Where did you come from? (Baby cries) what a beautiful \r\nlittle baby you are. ",
        "Cassie: I'm going to find your mommy. \r\n",
        "Camille: Excuse me. That's my baby. \r\n",
        "Cassie: Oh. Okay. Then maybe you could tell \r\nme why he was here all by himself, about to fall off a rock over there. \r\n",
        "Camille: Yeah, well, I only left him for a \r\nminute. So... ",
        "Cassie: Okay, well, you know a lot can happen \r\nto a child in a minute. (Baby fussing) Obviously, you don't know that. \r\n",
        "Camille: Yeah, I know how to take care of a \r\nkid, all right? I just had something important to do. ",
        "Cassie: More important than your son? \r\n",
        "Camille: I'm here to see president Winslow.\r\n",
        "Cassie: Well, I'm Mrs. Winslow. ",
        "Camille: Well, I didn't vote for you. Oh, no. \r\nOh, no. You need another diaper. You're going to have to wait. Look, if you are \r\nthe president's wife, would you mind telling me where he is, because I'm kind of \r\nin a hurry and this baby weighs a ton. ",
        "Cassie: I'm not so sure you know how to take \r\ncare of a kid. Because this little boy deserves a hell of a lot better than what \r\nhe's getting from you. ",
        "",
        "Reva: Everyone needs time to refocus... From time to time, you know? Put some \r\ndistance between their problems, and this seemed like a good place to do that. A \r\nplace to... ",
        "Holly: Hide. ",
        "Reva: Yeah. Does that sound as pathetic as I \r\nthink it does? ",
        "Holly: More. ",
        "Reva: Yeah, well. I don't know. Josh told me \r\nto butt out of his life, in no uncertain terms. So... ",
        "Holly: So just drop out of sight? Josh has \r\nspooked you that much? Or are you upset that he's still committed with Olivia?\r\n",
        "Reva: No. He made his choice. He has to live \r\nwith that. ",
        "Holly: Mm-hmm. And what about you? What's \r\ngoing on? Tell me. Do you feel humiliated? Unworthy? ",
        "(Laughter) ",
        "Reva: I don't know. That thought might have \r\ncrossed my mind. But that's not the way it is now. I don't have to be here. Not \r\nanymore. ",
        "",
        "Mel: You feeling better? ",
        "Rick: Not much. ",
        "Mel: Maybe if you find another table? \r\n",
        "Rick: No. It would be too easy, wouldn't it? \r\nNo, I think I'm going to park myself right here and tell you exactly what I \r\nthink. ",
        "Mel: About what? ",
        "Rick: About how to handle yourself as a \r\nmedical professional, which I would have told you back at the hospital in front \r\nof all the other doctors and nurses if I wasn't such a professional myself. No, \r\nMel, you need to learn. You need to learn right now how the status quo works \r\naround here, the chain of command. ",
        "Mel: You mean the pecking order. ",
        "Rick: Call it whatever you want. You... Okay, \r\nlook. I think that dialogue between doctors is really good for patient care, I \r\ndo. But this constant, constant second-guessing is a hindrance to it. \r\n",
        "Mel: What about a physician who is so uptight \r\nat having someone younger than him make suggestions that he ends up ignoring the \r\nadvice-- even when it's right-- out of his own insecurities? I call that a \r\nhindrance to patient care. ",
        "Rick: Oh, you do? Do you? ",
        "Mel: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Rick: If you think I was ignoring you, I was \r\nignoring you. ",
        "Mel: There you go! ",
        "Rick: I had to. I had no other choice. It got \r\nto a point where your constant suggestions were so non-stop, I couldn't think \r\nstraight. ",
        "Mel: Well, maybe you weren't thinking \r\nstraight to begin with. ",
        "Rick: You... Hmm. That pregnant woman was \r\nadmitted at 3:00 in the morning. ",
        "Mel: With the minor bleeding. ",
        "Rick: The staff ob/Gyn had the time off, so \r\nit was her case. Her case became my case. It was my case. ",
        "Mel: Mine, too. ",
        "Rick: No, it wasn't. Look, the point is, you \r\njust kept yammering away-- yammering, yammering, yammering... ",
        "Mel: Yammering? ",
        "Rick: Yammering. You just kept it up. I just \r\nhad to tune you out. ",
        "Mel: You were the one who wouldn't shut up. \r\nIt was like white noise. Look, the lady was upset. ",
        "Rick: That woman was confused and scared.\r\n",
        "Mel: But she wasn't in danger. ",
        "Rick: It was in the middle of the night, it \r\nwas her first child. ",
        "Mel: You treated her like she was suffering \r\nmajor trauma. ",
        "Rick: But you weren't interested in \r\ncomforting her. ",
        "Mel: She didn't need you to push her towards \r\npanic. ",
        "Rick: No, no. You were more interested in \r\nyour assessment of the situation. ",
        "Mel: With your... All you needed to do was...\r\n",
        "Rick: All I wanted to do was... ",
        "Together: Give her a pelvic sonogram. \r\n",
        "Rick: You... Did... did you want to give her \r\na p.s.? You did? That's exactly what I wanted to do. ",
        "Mel: So, we were on the same track after all? \r\nWow. How about that? ",
        "Rick: Yeah, how about that. ",
        "",
        "Edmund: Yes. Yes. ",
        "Lorelei: Yeah, what? ",
        "Edmund: You said you want to be a princess, \r\nright? ",
        "Lorelei: Sure. Who wouldn't? ",
        "Edmund: I said I want to be rich again.\r\n",
        "Lorelei: Yeah, so... What the heck are you \r\ngetting at? ",
        "Edmund: Just this: You be Beth. ",
        "Lorelei: Eddie, you are nuts, you know that?\r\n",
        "Edmund: No. I'll tell you what's nuts: Having \r\nthe chance to get and be everything you've ever wanted, and then letting it go. \r\nLimos, servants, a palace. That all could be yours. It could be ours. \r\n",
        "Lorelei: Yeah, except I ain't \r\nwhat's-her-name. ",
        "Edmund: Beth! You could be Beth. A little \r\nhair dye, some diction lessons, a course in the family history. No one would \r\nknow the difference. ",
        "Lorelei: I would. ",
        "Edmund: Good heavens, woman! This is the \r\nchance of a lifetime! You could be princess Elizabeth of San Cristobel. Picture \r\nit: I take you back to Springfield, and everyone would just stop dead in their \r\ntracks. \"Look, it's Beth. She lives.\" Your highness. ",
        "Lorelei: Oh, cut it out. Cut it out. \r\n",
        "Edmund: Come on. And that's not just the end \r\nof it. It doesn't stop there. I may have been run out of my country, but I'm \r\nstill royalty. Together we can go back and take back what was taken from me-- \r\nthe prestige, the acclaim, the money. The international pressure would mount on \r\nRichard. He'd have to leave San Cristobel. His reign would be no more, and...\r\n",
        "Lorelei: You're asking me to be a dead woman.\r\n",
        "Edmund: No, I'm asking you to breathe life \r\ninto her again. ",

        "Rick: I'm sorry. It got ugly at the hospital. I'm sorry about that. You know, \r\nworking those 48-hour shifts, it just makes me crazy. So I'm sorry I gave you \r\nsuch a hard time. ",
        "Mel: I wasn't digging in just to be right. \r\nThat patient was a pregnant woman\u2026 the second patient we've locked horns over in \r\njust as few weeks. ",
        "Rick: You're right. ",
        "Mel: I feel a real connection to the whole \r\nob/Gyn thing. I'm thinking of making it my specialty. ",
        "Rick: That's great, Mel. I mean, you could do \r\nworse. ",
        "Mel: Maybe that's why I was yammering. You're \r\na man and, I don't know, I guess I thought treating a pregnant woman couldn't \r\ncome natural to you. I was being protective of her. ",
        "Rick: And you're assuming that I wouldn't be? \r\nWell, you would be wrong on that one. When it comes to childbirth, Mel, very few \r\npeople are as attuned to that miracle as I am. And it's... it's not just a \r\nbusiness thing with me either. It's... it's very personal. ",

        "Camille: Oh, no? Let's see you try to be a \r\nsingle mom. Have a go at it on your own, without a dime when your husband walks \r\nout on you. ",

        "Camille: Sure. ",
        "Cassie: I've had to make decisions that would \r\nstop you in your tracks to raise two kids. I had to do things that I'm not very \r\nproud of. But I can tell you one thing, I have never put my needs before theirs. \r\nAnd that's exactly what I see you doing. ",
        "Camille: Well, let me tell you one thing. \r\nThis is none of your business. ",

        "Mel: When's the baby due? ",
        "Rick: Any day. Yeah, I'll be finding out by \r\ne-mail, instead of actually being there at the delivery table. Yeah, shut-out \r\ndad. But this stays between us, right? ",

Am I embarrassed by this? \r\nNo. In fact, the truth is I've never been more excited about anything in my \r\nlife. Well, I'm... going to go home and get some rest.
