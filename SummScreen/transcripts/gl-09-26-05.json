        "Danny: We can't go back, Michelle. We both know that, and I'm sorry to point out the obvious, but you're running away from your life the same way that your father did, and we both know what that did to you.",
        "Michelle: I don't see any other way, Danny. You know, despite everything that happened in our past, despite all of our pain, there was always one thing that I was sure of, and that was us.",
        "Danny: Michelle...",
        "Michelle: And there is no us anymore. And with no us, it just feels like there's no me. I'm sorry, that's how I feel.",

        "Marina: And they all went to Towers.",
        "Coop: Well, it's whatever the receipt said.",
        "Marina: And they all went to the same room. So this must have been where she was staying after she left Bill's. I don't know, was she there alone? Was there someone else?",

Uh, see, Beth and I, we're headed to the zoo, and we decided to stop by the day care center to pick up Robbie to take him with us, and well, we get there and I turn my back for just a second and boom, he's gone. Don't panic. Everything's fine. We found him on the roof of the building, playing airplane with that nurse that he likes so much. What's her name? You know? She's, you know, the tall one, with dark hair. Really smoking body. I mean, she's...",

        "Rick: Yeah. I'm assuming by your tone that you don't want her to take the job.",
        "Beth: It's not my decision to make. You know, we all have our priorities. Me, I feel that there is nothing more important than that connection between a mother and a child.",

        "Lizzie: Why would you think that...",
        "Beth: I know that you did it. You can walk like a Cooper and talk like a Cooper and even vote like a Cooper, but at the end of the day, you're a Spaulding. And despite all of your mistakes, it is not too late to come back home and start earning your family's respect.",

        "Michelle: That's right. Hardly anybody even knows about it yet, but I'm going to be helping Grandpa Ed.",
        "Danny: Yep. They're going to help lots of other little boys and girls feel better when they get sick, like they did in Africa.",
        "Robbie: Is California as far as Africa?",
        "Danny: No. No no, actually it's a closer.",
        "Robbie: Then we'll all go. You, Mommy, and me.",
        "Michelle: Well, we can't, Honey. Not this time.",
        "Robbie: Why not?",
        "Michelle: Well, because Daddy has a lot of work to do here.",
        "Robbie: Can I stay with him?",
        "Danny: No. You're going to go to California with Mommy. But that means we're going to see each other all the time. You're going to come here and I'm going to fly out there and we're going to go to Sea World and the beach. Doesn't that sound like fun? No?",

        "Marina: Hi. I'm sorry, you scared me to death. I'm the new help. I was hired to help with the convention, the interior design convention. This is the showroom, right? The model designed by Cooper, Frank? I'm supposed to clean it. They told you, right?",
        "Maid: That's no designer showcase. Some bigwig lives here.",
        "Marina: A bigwig? What bigwig?",
        "Maid: All I know is he doesn't want maid service anymore.",
        "Marina: Why?",

        "Marina: Oh, my God. It's Edmund.",
        "Marina: Michelle was staying with Edmund when she was pregnant? No wonder he's been acting so weird. But what does it mean? It could mean nothing. Maybe they're friends or something. But maybe...",
        "Edmund: Complications. Messy, messy, messy situations. I just have to clean things up, clean them up. ( Telephone rings ) Oh, God, what now? Hello?",

        "Robbie: I can make her laugh.",
        "Michelle: Robbie always makes me laugh.",
        "Danny: And you're going to have to help her with the Sunday crossword puzzle because she can never finish it.",
        "Michelle: I can, too.",
        "Danny: Oh, please. There are always at least three answers missing. Trust me on that. So if you need help, you call me, okay? And remind Grandpa Ed that Mommy likes orchids on her birthday, not roses.",
        "Robbie: Orchids, okay.",
        "Danny: Okay. And don't tell anyone, but your mommy gets all the words wrong when she sings along to the radio.",
        "Michelle: Ha, ha, ha.",
        "Danny: Oh, and she has a temper, too. A terrible one. Do you think you can make a face when she gets mad?",
        "Robbie: Like this? ( Laughter )",
        "Danny: Yeah. That's great. Good job. So I can see that Mommy is in very good hands. She'll be with somebody who loves her just as much as I do, and, hey, if she ever gets sad or lonely, I am just a phone call away. You just pick up the phone and call me, okay?",
        "Michelle: See? It's all going to work out. It's going to be one great big adventure. No?",

        "Tammy: She'll go after Hope and I can't let that happen to my mom. She loves that baby so much and she's so happy. I can't let Dinah mess things up for her.",

        "Tammy: Then stop. Just let it go. Stop searching for Dinah. If she never comes back, it'll be too soon.",
        "Jonathan: No, that's what I'm worried about, Tammy. What if she doesn't come back? What if something happened to her?",
        "Tammy: That is such a lie. God, what is it with you? It's like all the people in your life are so screwed up. I mean, first your father and then Dinah. It's like you're drawn to all the wrong people.",
