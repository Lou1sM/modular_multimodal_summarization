        "Jonathan: Ow! Piece of...",
        "Lizzie: Hey, not in front the of the baby.",
        "Jonathan: What, like this baby isn't going to hear curse words? Don't you have people you hire to do this stuff?",
        "Lizzie: Yes, but the daddy is supposed to do it. That way I can tell Brandy about the day....",
        "Jonathan: Brandy? Who's Brandy?",
        "Lizzie: The baby. I'm trying out new names.",
        "Jonathan: Brandy Randall? Sounds like a stripper.",
        "Lizzie: Anyway, then I can tell our little girl about the day that daddy put her crib together. Go back to work.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. I think this watch Tammy gave me is slow.",
        "Lizzie: Is it that bad being here with me?",
        "Jonathan: No. Look, I want to make this fake marriage thing work so Alan can't get his hands on the baby. But if I don't see Tammy soon, I'm going to kill somebody. And I know she feels the same way. Got it!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Remy: Okay. Last chance to run for the hills.",
        "Tammy: Oh, I like your family.",
        "Remy: Everyone likes my family. Doesn't mean you want to eat with them.",
        "Tammy: Well, I do.",
        "Remy: It will be good for you to hang out with us for a while, but there are some rules.",
        "Tammy: Okay, like keep your elbows off the table?",
        "Remy: No, like no bringing us down with Jonathan talk.",
        "Tammy: Well, excuse me if I'm just a little bit bummed that my boyfriend is married to someone else.",
        "Remy: Yeah, yeah, we've all got problems.",
        "Tammy: Nice, nice, some friend.",
        "Remy: Where is everybody?",
        "Tammy: You go find your sister. I'll be right here.",
        "Remy: So, you don't mind if I stand here then?",
        "Tammy: I don't need a chaperon to make a phone call.",
        "Remy: Oh, you need one for this call.",
        "Tammy: Shut up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: I'm going to hop in the shower. Answer my phone if it rings, okay?",
        "Lizzie: Okay. Sure he grumbled and complained the entire time, but he really did a good job. (Phone rings) Tammy. Jonathan, Tammy's calling. (Phone continues to ring)",
        "Tammy: Jonathan, it's me. I thought you'd be waiting by the phone. Guess not. Sorry I missed you. I am missing you like crazy, and I just wanted to hear your voice. I wonder if we could see each other. Things have cooled off a little bit. And, you know, if we're careful, who knows. So let's talk about it, okay? I love you. Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Well, look who's here.",
        "Olivia: Shut up.",
        "Billy: Hey, that was downright mean.",
        "Olivia: Yes, it was. I'm sorry. Let me make it up to you.",
        "Billy: Good. I agree. I'm a little lonely. Why don't you sit down and keep my company.",
        "Olivia: Come on. Sure. Why not? I have nothing better to do. So, who's buying? (Music playing)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Oh, I remember now what the movie was at the dive-in that night.",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Reva: \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.\"",
        "Josh: Yeah, well that would be our movie. I want to spend my life with you since we've been together...",
        "Cassie: Josh? Are you here? Josh, are you in there? Hello? Josh?",
        "Josh: Yeah, Cassie, I'm here. I want to spend my life with you... right here.",
        "Cassie: Hi.",
        "Josh: Hi. The door slammed shut.",
        "Cassie: So you're stuck inside?",
        "Josh: Yeah, in fact, we've been in here for quite a while.",
        "Cassie: \"We?\"",
        "Reva: Hi, sis.",
        "Cassie: Hi.",
        "Josh: So if you could possibly...",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I'll... I'll go find someone to open the gate.",
        "Josh: Thank you. Okay. So, what just happened?",
        "Reva: Nothing happened.",
        "Josh: Is that going to be the official line then, we pretend nothing happened?",
        "Reva: Sounds like a plan to me.",
        "Josh: It did happen, Reva. And I'm glad.",
        "Reva: Joshua, we...",
        "Josh: No... no, Reva, the kiss...",
        "Reva: Was a mistake.",
        "Josh: No it wasn't. It was a good thing because it was saying good-bye.",
        "Reva: Good-bye.",
        "Josh: Yeah, finally. Reva, everything we've done, we've done in the heat of the moment-- breaking up, getting back together, getting divorced, getting married again. Maybe we signed those divorce papers too fast. I don't know. Maybe it was too easy. Maybe we were pretending that there wasn't more going on, that our feelings...",
        "Reva: Really, Cassie's going to be back any minute. Do you really want to get into this conversation?",
        "Josh: Yes, I do. Because we have to have this conversation, Reva. We need it to let go and to move on.",
        "Reva: I want that, too.",
        "Josh: You realize what this means, right? This is different than the other times.",
        "Reva: I know.",
        "Josh: And you're all right with the idea of me and Cassie?",
        "Reva: Do you find that hard to believe?",
        "Josh: A little bit, yeah.",
        "Reva: No, I want it. You deserve it, Joshua. But don't make it any harder by asking me to talk about it or explore my feelings about it. That's something you can do for me. I mean, this never should have happened, but I'm not sorry it did. Good-bye, Joshua.",
        "Cassie: So, you're free.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Here you go.",
        "Olivia: Thanks.",
        "Billy: My pleasure.",
        "Olivia: Why?",
        "Billy: Because I got some time to kill and you look like you can use a cup of coffee.",
        "Olivia: I'm not drunk.",
        "Billy: Where'd that come from?",
        "Olivia: You're just always looking at me like I'm trying hide something.",
        "Billy: Fair enough. So you hear from Bill?",
        "Olivia: He checks on Emma.",
        "Billy: How is your little girl?",
        "Olivia: She's fine. She's fine.",
        "Billy: Bill really loves her.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, I know, so much so that he left the country to get away from us-- me. He loves her. I know he does. You know, Emma and I are doing okay by ourselves. We really are.",
        "Billy: Still tough being a single mom.",
        "Olivia: I got it under control.",
        "Billy: That's what you want to do, right?",
        "Olivia: There's no harm in having your life under control, right?",
        "Billy: Right. I just try to take it one day at a time.",
        "Olivia: Here comes the lecture.",
        "Billy: You know, truth? I think you're one of those people who makes things harder for herself than she needs to.",
        "Olivia: I think you're right. I'm trying to change that. I'm trying to simplify things.",
        "Billy: Good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Remy: Ma'am, I'm going to have to confiscate the phone.",
        "Tammy: You can't do that.",
        "Remy: Ma'am, if you don't cooperate...",
        "Tammy: You'll what?",
        "Remy: Don't make me use my cuffs.",
        "Tammy: What's the big deal if I have the phone?",
        "Remy: You are officially off the grid in Bauerville.",
        "Mel: Hi, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: Hi, Mel, hi, Leah.",
        "Mel: How are you?",
        "Tammy: Good. Thanks for letting me crash your dinner.",
        "Mel: Dinners are an open-door policy.",
        "Tammy: Where's Rick?",
        "Mel: He had to work a double shift tonight.",
        "Leah: More dessert for us. You ready?",
        "Tammy: For?",
        "Remy: I didn't mention that. I didn't want to scare you off.",
        "Mel: Oh, yeah, people don't just come and sit and eat. We put you to work. So, let's get on it. Come on.",
        "Remy: What's our job?",
        "Mel: You two are on salad duty. Here's the chopping board.",
        "Tammy: I can do that.",
        "Remy: All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Anybody call? Did anybody call?",
        "Lizzie: What?",
        "Jonathan: I thought I heard my cell phone.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, I don't know. All I heard was you in the shower and this classical music, which they say is supposed to make the baby smarter.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I think the point is you're supposed to play it to your belly so the baby can hear it, not in your own ears.",
        "Lizzie: Oh.",
        "Jonathan: Blonds.",
        "Lizzie: Your daughter might be a blond.",
        "Jonathan: Hope not. Tammy called. I knew it. How are you going to hear anything with those things in your ears?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, just chill out and call her back. What are you doing?",
        "Jonathan: Well, Alan's out of town and I don't see weird Dr. Baker out there anywhere.",
        "Lizzie: Are you going to go and try to see Tammy?",
        "Jonathan: I'm thinking maybe they gave up on trying to catch us.",
        "Lizzie: It's my granddad. His number-one priority is to prove that our marriage is bogus so he can take control of the child. It's a Spaulding heir. He is never going to give up!",
        "Jonathan: Well, maybe he takes a night off every now and then. I'm feeling brave, know what I mean?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, feeling desperate.",
        "Jonathan: That, too. I'm going to see Tammy. Come on.",
        "Lizzie: You'll get caught, the game is off for all of us. I could get sent away. Granddad could take the baby after she's born.",
        "Jonathan: I'm not going to get caught.",
        "Lizzie: You don't know what granddad has planned.",
        "Jonathan: Look, I'm not going to let anything happen to you or the kid. I have to go see Tammy, okay? I'll bring you back some of that disgusting ice cream you like.",
        "Lizzie: Rocky road is not disgusting! Say hi to Tammy for me.",
        "Man: Hello, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: I hate being spied on. I catch you on my property, I have every right to defend myself.",
        "Man: I haven't done anything to you.",
        "Jonathan: Not yet. Now what if I find you in my apartment? My wife is pregnant and I'm worried about her and the baby. You go for something in your pocket, I have no choice but to take you out.",
        "Man: Hey, that's insane.",
        "Jonathan: No, no, that works for me. That works for every court in the land. You tell that to Alan Spaulding. And I have another message you can give to him, too.",
        "Lizzie: That is the message. I love my husband and he loves me. There's nothing more to see here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mel: Where's the bread?",
        "Leah: You're asking me?",
        "Mel: We're supposed to have a picnic with sandwiches. How are we supposed to do that without bread? Remy, you were supposed to buy the bread.",
        "Remy: Leah.",
        "Leah: Don't look at me.",
        "Tammy: Well, do you have toothpicks?",
        "Mel: Toothpicks, instead of bread?",
        "Tammy: Back in the old days, when times were really tough, my mom had to improvise. We lived above a deli and old baloney was cheap, so roll it up with some cheese-- Cassie sandwich.",
        "Leah: Weren't you like a princess or something?",
        "Tammy: For a while, but times were pretty tough before that, and sometimes things were tough after.",
        "Leah: My dad tells me that he thanks Richard every morning when he gets up. He says he's thankful he gets to see another day because of your dad.",
        "Tammy: Really?",
        "Remy: I told you you'd feel at home. A piece of your family still lives with us.",
        "Tammy: That feels good. It's nice to know that Richard's heart found a warm home. You're such a strong, loving family. You know, since he died, I haven't felt anything close to that in a while.",
        "Leah: Well, you helped us with dinner, so you're basically family, now.",
        "Tammy: Well, it's been my honor. (Laughter)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Hey, Billy, you okay?",
        "Billy: Me? Yeah. Life's... life's life. I just kind of grab what I can when I can, you know?",
        "Olivia: What does that mean?",
        "Billy: Well, it means that I'm... I got a life. I got people who love me. I know why I'm here, and everything's pretty right.",
        "Olivia: That's good.",
        "Billy: You take care.",
        "Olivia: Well, careful. You almost sound like you meant it.",
        "Billy: I did. You know, believe it or not, you and I are a lot alike. I think that's why we grind on each other. Life's funny that way. I'll see you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: So you got stuck down here, both of you. What are the odds of that?",
        "Reva: Yeah, it's weird, huh?",
        "Josh: Yeah. I think I'm going to have to start thinking about parking on the street because obviously I don't have good luck with automatic doors.",
        "Cassie: So Reva, what were you doing here?",
        "Reva: Well, I knew how worried you were about Joshua, so I thought I'd look for him, too, and here he is. Here we are. I mean, we can all stand here silent and uncomfortable, but you two owe me a whole lot more than that.",
        "Cassie: Excuse me?",
        "Reva: Well, you know I'm right. I am the one who's dying here, and this whole situation is totally unfair because you two get to live these long, lovely lives together with each other. And did I happen to mention that I am the one that's dying.",
        "Josh: Reva, if you had told me sooner...",
        "Reva: You're not going to go back to that, are you? Because I'm going to have to say, \"So what?\" Because I didn't tell you earlier, okay, because I thought I could handle it on my own.",
        "Cassie: Who handles cancer on their own?",
        "Reva: Who cares? The fact still remains that you two stabbed me in the back. How dare you? How dare you get to watch my children grow up? How dare you find love with each other of all people? And you, Joshua, how dare you betray me with after everything we've been together all these years? And you, Cassie, my own sister with my husband! How could you do that? It's not right. It's just not... Yeah, the three of us. Thank you, really, for keeping me calm down here, Joshua. I'm really glad you found him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan Clark, \"Inside The Light\"...",
        "Billy: This place has always felt like a home. Once you got hired, you were like family. I even remember Ed Trox saying, \"Hey, you've always got work.\" He talks straight to you. It was never that kind of like, \"Oh, yeah, I love you, you were fabulous, great-- next.\" I always felt like it was home. Watch the show. Don't dawdle. Find out when it's on and watch. We love you.",
        "Jonathan: See Billy Wednesday, September 27, \"Inside The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Well, at least the power's on this time, right? You know, I've been trying to reach you.",
        "Josh: I know.",
        "Cassie: I was starting to worry.",
        "Josh: I'm sorry.",
        "Cassie: I guess you just didn't want to be found, huh, or at least not by me.",
        "Josh: I just needed some time on my own, that's all, to think.",
        "Cassie: How's that working out for you?",
        "Josh: (Laughs) Well, I think I might have stayed lost for a little while longer if Billy hadn't shown up. I wasn't coming any closer to understanding anything at all. I got some good building in, though.",
        "Cassie: Good. Good, so kind of awkward me coming in here just now, huh? How is everything with Reva?",
        "Josh: Fine, great, terrific, no big deal. We were just here talking, you know what, I'm not going to do that.",
        "Cassie: Do what?",
        "Josh: Lie to you about what happened here with Reva just now.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Do I want to hear this?",
        "Josh: I don't know, but I think you need to. I need explain to you exactly what you walked into Reva was hiding behind this pillar over here. I kind of caught her doing that I tried to figure out what was going on. Then the thing slammed down. We talked and we shared a soda. And we laughed and we argued about some things, and then she turned on the radio and we danced. I don't know why really. Look, look, the whole thing was about the two of us saying good- bye. We needed to do that. Okay? And we kissed.",
        "Cassie: Oh, my God.",
        "Josh: Cassie! Cassie!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: What happened? I ran into Cassie. She wasn't anywhere near the garage where Josh was.",
        "Reva: The whole thing backfired, Billy, the whole thing. Josh and I ended up getting trapped in the garage.",
        "Billy: You and Josh were in the garage together?",
        "Reva: Why is the universe conspiring against me? I mean, it's hard enough that I have to watch Josh and Cassie together. And, I mean, Josh and I can't ever catch a break. We try to be together and the world keeps us apart, and then that same rotten luck always throws us back together.",
        "Billy: So what happened?",
        "Reva: Huh?",
        "Billy: You heard me.",
        "Reva: Billy, you made me an offer. We had a deal to make this real, not just some show for everyone.",
        "Billy: Where's this going?",
        "Reva: That meant a whole lot to me.",
        "Billy: Wait a minute. You kissed Josh.",
        "Reva: I love him, Billy. I can't help it. I still love him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: It was nice to just be.",
        "Remy: Yeah, you should do that some more.",
        "Tammy: You don't mind if I check my e-mail.",
        "Remy: Anything from Johnny boy?",
        "Tammy: Take that tone out of your voice. And no, nothing from Jonathan. Speaking of which, can I have my phone back?",
        "Remy: You'll have to put in a request with...",
        "Tammy: Oh, my God.",
        "Remy: What, what, what?",
        "Tammy: Oh, my God, I got a note from my professor. Not only am I going to get an \"A\" on that paper, but he wants me to publish it in the undergrad student review. I am getting published!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Why isn't Tammy answering? Where is she?",
        "Lizzie: Maybe she's at the library at school. You know, she does have to study in between obsessing over you and fighting over my granddad. You are making it worse. You're driving yourself crazy.",
        "Jonathan: I am going crazy.",
        "Lizzie: I know that you would rather be somewhere else with someone else doing something else, but being with me, it's not that bad. We get public exposure.",
        "Jonathan: It's not about you, Lizzie, okay. You know I'm doing everything I can for you and the baby. This is about my and Tammy, not having her in my life...",
        "Lizzie: Maybe we could go to a movie or get something to eat.",
        "Jonathan: All you think about is food.",
        "Lizzie: Don't be a jerk. You know why I'm hungry.",
        "Jonathan: There's that friend from the apartment. I'm going to knock. Would you knock that off. That is not a good way to stop me.",
        "Lizzie: Maybe I wasn't trying to stop you. Maybe I kissed you for myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Okay. So that just happened. I was not expecting that. I'm sure you weren't expecting that, either. We were just having a good time. We had a little bit of wine. We got excited about my paper being published. You helped me. It was just one of those spur of the moment, never even thought about it before kind of things, right? Right?",
        "Remy: No. I've been thinking about doing that for a long time.",
        "Tammy: But you know I have Jonathan. Even though it seems like I'm single.",
        "Remy: Right, you're in a very committed relationship with a married man.",
        "Tammy: Okay. You know what the deal is with that. It is only a matter of time before things get worked out with Lizzie and the baby and then Jonathan will be back here and we'll be...",
        "Remy: I know all of that. Yeah.",
        "Tammy: But you don't believe it.",
        "Remy: Do you?",
        "Tammy: I have to believe it.",
        "Remy: I know. Congrats on tour paper. You seem to be doing really well him out of the picture, you've been having some fun. I'll see you around.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: What?",
        "Jonathan: You're staring at me. I don't know why, but I do know you. It's probably not good, so stop.",
        "Lizzie: I just thought... that I should give you, whatever... I'm sorry, okay?",
        "Jonathan: For what?",
        "Lizzie: Being moody and emotional all the time, vulnerable. I almost kissed the doorman while he held the door for me today.",
        "Jonathan: Well, I guess being pregnant makes girls crazy.",
        "Lizzie: I feel urgey.",
        "Jonathan: \"Urgey?\"",
        "Lizzie: It's been a long time, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Since?",
        "Lizzie: I need affection, you dope. I mean, besides you, when was even the last time that I kissed another guy? Yeah. And then I start thinking, what if I never kiss another guy? What if I never find anyone ever again? I mean, who is going to want the girl with the baby? Well, she had plenty of issues before and now she's really strapped baggage.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. Come here. Sit down. Look, the pregnancy thing is a little rough, but you have something going for you that all guys love.",
        "Lizzie: Hotness?",
        "Jonathan: Money.",
        "Lizzie: I'm serious. No, okay? I see you and Tammy and Coop and Ava. Just makes me feel hopeless.",
        "Jonathan: Look, when the time comes, we'll help you out. Me and Tammy will watch the kid. You go out and date and you'll be fine, even if you are pregnant and look like a bloated elephant.",
        "Lizzie: Not helping!",
        "Jonathan: You're still a catch.",
        "Lizzie: Really?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Yeah. And I guess for now I can pat you on the head once in a while.",
        "Lizzie: I'm getting ice cream.",
        "Jonathan: Keep the change you filthy animal.",
        "Lizzie: Thanks. Hi, rocky road, please. Stay close. I want Jonathan to think that my grandfather's always watching.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Cassie, will you just hold on for a minute.",
        "Cassie: What is there to say...?",
        "Josh: Just hold on for a minute. To begin with, no more running.",
        "Cassie: Damn right no more running. Who's been avoiding me? Who disappeared to a construction site so he wouldn't have to deal with anything more interactive than a backhoe and a shovel?",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Cassie: And then sign his divorce papers only to find himself in a lip lock with his ex?",
        "Josh: You know, I hear what you're saying. I want to help, but that honestly doesn't sound like anybody that I know. Why did you come after me?",
        "Cassie: Because I'm ready to fight for what we have, Josh, but not if I have to watch my back with you and Reva.",
        "Josh: You don't, okay? You don't. I'm going to say something to you now that's going to sound really, really bad until I fully explain it.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Thanks for the warning.",
        "Josh: Kissing Reva was a good thing.",
        "Cassie: Okay. I want to smack you now.",
        "Josh: Just hear me out, okay, Cassie? The time I had with Reva in the garage just now, it showed me how deeply I feel for her, and that's not going to change. Divorce papers or no divorce papers, we're always going to have this unique connection.",
        "Cassie: Okay, is this supposed to be helping?",
        "Josh: And... and we're always going to run into each other, okay?",
        "Cassie: Well, hopefully you won't be locked in together.",
        "Josh: Cassie. The garage did for me what the construction site could not. It cleared my mind. It settled some things so now I can say this to you. I have never been more certain of where I want to be and where I want to be is with you. Unless what happened in the garage scared the daylights out of you, then...",
        "Cassie: All right, if there's one thing I learned from my sister, it's don't be afraid. So I won't be. I won't be afraid of Reva. And I want be afraid of your past. I'll just...We can dive into this and in a few years or a few weeks, it all goes to hell, then we'll face it then. Because I am not going to lose my chance at something amazing with you today because I'm afraid of what might not be there tomorrow. So, no. Not afraid.",
        "Josh: Neither am I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I never want to play with your emotions.",
        "Billy: Wait. You're not playing with my emotions.",
        "Reva: There's a whole long list of incredible things you've done for me these past few months. At the top of that list has been your honesty. I want to be the same way with you.",
        "Billy: It's no secret that you love Josh. Anybody could see it. I think if you were healthy, you'd jump in a second.",
        "Reva: I never said that.",
        "Billy: No, you didn't. I figured that one out all by myself.",
        "Reva: And you're okay with that?",
        "Billy: Hey, look, I'm a big boy and I came into this with my eyes open. Besides, you and I are you and me. And you and Josh... I don't want to take Josh's place in your heart, sweetie. I've always felt it. I kind of had a little place there all to myself, any way.",
        "Reva: You do really, of course you do.",
        "Billy: So, what do you think this all means, this thing with Josh?",
        "Reva: It can't mean anything. It was a moment of weakness. But more than that, it was a moment of forgetting. When I was in his arms I forgot that I was sick. I forgot that I was dying and I forgot that I wasn't just any woman in the arms of the man she's loved her whole life.",
        "Billy: Hey, look at me. Okay, now, I'm a little rusty at this, but I used to be pretty good at it. And there's got to be limitation. But I'm pretty sure I could make you forget if you gave me a chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Did it get chilly all of a sudden?",
        "Josh: Come here.",
        "Cassie: Fall already.",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: Never in a million years did I ever imagine...",
        "Josh: It's okay to finish it, Cassie, and say what you were going to say. We don't have to hold back anymore.",
        "Cassie: I don't want to make things weird. I don't know, it might be too soon. Just not the right time.",
        "Josh: You were about to say that you never thought in a million years that you would fall in love with me. At least that's what I'm hoping you were going to say.",
        "Cassie: No fear, right?",
        "Josh: Easier said than done.",
        "Cassie: I know. But I'm going to try. I want to say it and I want to tell you. I love you, Josh. I do. Completely. And you don't have to say a word.",
        "Josh: I love you, too, Cassie. I love you, too. I don't think I'll confess why would I confess I don't think I'll deny why would I deny you won't get better till you send a little smile my way don't be so hard on yourself you won't get better till you send a little note my way don't be so hard on yourself you won't get bitter till you send a little smile my way and every second I spend waiting drags me closer to this face... and don't think I'll escape why would I escape you and don't think I'll replace how could I replace you don't be so hard on yourself you won't get bitter till you send a little smile my way don't be so hard on yourself you won't get better till you send a little note my way and every second I spend waiting drags me closer to this face...",

        "Josh: You just missed a shooting star. You could have made a wish.",
        "Cassie: I already did.",
        "Josh: Well, don't tell me what it was because it might not come true.",
        "Cassie: It already has."
