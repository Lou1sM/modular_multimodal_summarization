        "Danny: You know, I can't tell you. I don't \r\nwant you involved.",
        "Michelle: I'm already involved. I love you \r\nand you love me.",
        "Danny: They want me to steal $25 million from \r\nSpaulding, electronically.",
        "Michelle: They want you to use your in at the \r\ncompany to access their computers. Oh, my god.",
        "Danny: Yeah, so much for going legit.",
        "Michelle: Whose idea was this?",
        "Danny: I don't know. Does it really matter?",
        "Michelle: Yeah, yeah. I mean the more facts \r\nthat we know about this, the better we can decide what to do. Why don't you just \r\ntell me how this all started?",
        "Danny: I don't know. Apparently from somebody \r\nhigh up who I've never heard of. Carlos was just a messenger.",
        "Michelle: Any names come to mind?",
        "Danny: No, all I know is that whoever running \r\nthis said that the families will let me go for good if I do them this one favor, \r\nbut only if I do them this.",
        "Michelle: And if you say no?",
        "Danny: Then you and Robbie are in as much \r\ndanger as I am.",
        "Michelle: What about your insurance policies \r\nthat you wrote out?",
        "Danny: They're useless. They're completely \r\nuseless if I don't know who I\u2019m dealing with.",
        "Michelle: If you tell Carlos yes...",
        "Danny: And I do it? And if I get caught? \r\nThen... Let's see. Then Robbie will only know his father as somebody in an \r\norange jumpsuit who he sees through plexiglas once a month. That's a hell of a \r\nchoice I've got.",

        "Gus: Oh, well, keeping an eye on you is a top \r\npriority for me these days. So what's up?",
        "Carmen: I just wanted to double check our \r\narrangement, make sure we understand each other.",
        "Gus: I think we understand each other. You \r\nget to stay out of jail by helping me put Danny in jail. It's pretty simple, \r\nreally.",
        "Carmen: Is it really that simple?",
        "Gus: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Carmen: Is Washington really going to go \r\nalong with a plan that basically relies on entrapment?",
        "Gus: Well, if the plan works.",
        "Carmen: Seems pretty risky. The bureau's \r\ngotten a lot of bad press lately. If this were ever to become public...",
        "Gus: Well, it's worth a gamble let's just put \r\nit that way.",
        "Carmen: Danny's that important to the powers \r\nthat be?",
        "Gus: Why don't you just let me and my people \r\nworry about where Danny does or does not fit in the grand scheme of things, \r\nokay? You only have one thing to worry about, and that is delivering Danny.",
        "Carmen: Danny won't even know what hit him. \r\nFirst there'll be the arrest, the indictment, public humiliation, and then many, \r\nmany years in prison.",
        "Gus: Said his loving, sweet mother.",
        "Carmen: Yeah, well, once your own son pops \r\nyou, warm feelings tend to fade. I'm focusing on the new Santos generation: \r\nRobbie.",
        "Gus: It's funny. You really can't wait to get \r\nyour hands on that little kid, can you?",

        "Blake: Well, you ready? They're making a \r\nmovie out of my book. They are. My publisher is flying me to Los Angeles to meet \r\nwith producers.",
        "Holly: Oh, darling. \"Hearts Alone,\" the \r\nmovie?",
        "Blake: Yeah, it's the perfect next step. Talk \r\nabout perfect timing. Two weeks ago I wouldn't have been able to make this trip.",
        "Holly: Why, because Ross had been so down in \r\nthe dumps?",
        "Blake: Yeah not to mention our children. But \r\nnow everybody's back in school, including Ross. He loves his new job as law \r\nprofessor at Springfield U. And I love what it's doing for our relationship, \r\nI've got to tell you. It's amazing the difference a little thing can make in a \r\nrelationship. Anyway, I need your help planning this trip because most of the \r\nmeetings take place in Century City, and I'm not sure where to stay. What's a \r\ngood hotel there, do you know? Mom?",
        "Holly: Hmm?",
        "Blake: I'm looking for a good hotel.",
        "Holly: I always like the Springfield inn.",
        "Blake: Okay. Well, now that we've established \r\nyou have not heard a word I've said, why don't we just forget about me and focus \r\non you. At least that'll make two of us.",
        "Holly: I'm sorry. I guess I'm a little \r\npreoccupied.",

        "Sam: Allow me, Buzz. I'll take care of this. \r\nWe have a wonderful seafood special today. Pasta with princed clams. Ooh, I\u2019m \r\nsorry, did I say that?",

        "Sam: Sure. Oh, remember, this one here: Big \r\nspender. Go wild with him\u2026 ex-royalty and what not. But next time, get him to \r\ntake you to a place called Towers for dinner.",
        "Edmund: Arrogant little twit.",
        "Lorelei: I think he's cute. Okay. Ooh, buzz \r\nburger, extra onions, large fries, chocolate shake, apple pie a la mode, and oh, \r\na hunk of chocolate cake for later.",
        "Edmund: I'll order it. Just wait in the car.",

        "Ross: No, no. My eyes are just playing tricks \r\non me again.",
        "Tory: Well, I know one thing that can't play \r\ntricks on you: Opposing attorneys. You saw right through Laughton in court \r\ntoday.",
        "Ross: Well, it's fairly easy. The man was \r\ntransparent, you know.",
        "Tory: You countered every move he made. You \r\nknow, it was so impressive to see you using the techniques you've been \r\ndiscussing in class.",
        "Ross: Well, good. I'm glad you enjoyed your \r\nfield trip. But the case is not over yet, is it?",
        "Tory: No. But it will be, just as soon as you \r\ncite \"Young versus California.\"",
        "Ross: What?",
        "Tory: It's got to be what you're planning to \r\ndo. You just have Laughton too perfectly set up not to spring \"Young\" on him.",

        "Edmund: Starving. Yes, I know. But that \r\nlittle pest knew Beth, and it was only a matter of time until he realized you \r\nlook exactly like her. Now this place is filling up with people who knew Beth. I \r\nneed time with you alone, and lots of it. I need to immerse you in Beth\u2019s \r\nhistory, her style, and her manner.

        "Richard: It's not enough.",
        "Cassie: No, it's not enough. I wanted us to \r\nhave a child of our own. I wanted to be real parents with you. I wanted to ooh \r\nand ah over our little baby girl or our little baby boy, and I wanted to drive \r\npeople crazy with videos or pictures that explain it..

        "Mayhew: And learn that he's the true heir to \r\nthe throne-- that he's prince William.",
        "Dax: Richard himself still needs a slight \r\npush to become more assertive with Cassie if she's to form a bond strong enough \r\nto adopt this baby.",
        "Mayhew: You and Richard are old friends. \r\nDoesn't it bother you to manipulate him like this?",
