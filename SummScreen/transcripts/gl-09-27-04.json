        "Bill: Harley. Harley. Harley, Harley, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. What is going on?",
        "Harley: This is bad, Bill. This is really bad, because I faxed... Well, Ruth faxed for Phillip a work order condemning this place, and I thought I would have enough time to come up with a plan, but look!",
        "Bill: Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.",
        "Harley: It's going full steam ahead.",
        "Bill: Calm down.",
        "Harley: If my father loses this place, he's going to fall apart. And what about Frank?",
        "Bill: Harley, Harley, Harley! Listen to me. Listen to me. I know exactly what you need. Oh.",
        "Harley: I feel so much better, Bill, Thank you.",

        "Sandy: He's not here. I left it for him, though.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "JB: Your family?",

        "Jeffrey: You can't pin this one on me, Winslow.",
        "Edmund: You're the district attorney, O'Neill. It was your call to let Dinah walk. And now Cassie's out there with a homicidal maniac--an armed homicidal maniac--and I have no intention of losing her because of your incompetence.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: You don't want to shoot me, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: You have stolen enough from me and my family and it has to end... Now.",
        "Dinah: Listen to me. I loved Hart just as much as you did. I did not mean to kill him. I regret everything I've done. I am not the same person, Cassie. You've got to believe that. You don't want to shoot me. I am the one that brought RJ into this world, do you remember? In the car?",
        "Cassie: You have ten seconds to live. That's nine more than you gave Hart before you blew him away.",

        "Harley: Hey, no problem.",
        "Bill: Yeah, and I'll tell you something. You look pretty good for a detainee. From that smile, I think your trip was pretty productive, huh? How many stockholders did you bag?",
        "Olivia: Well, enough to consider changing slingshot to Goliath. We are going to be the monster in Phillip's nightmares. He won't be able to keep us down.",
        "Harley: No, he'll just keep us out instead. Can you believe this jerk? He won't even let us go in there and get our stuff out.",

        "Sandy: Ah. You know what? You were right earlier. You really do need a hobby.",
        "Reva: (Laughs)",
        "Sandy: And speaking of, when is Josh coming home? He always knew how to keep you occupied.",
        "Reva: Yeah. Yeah, he does. Unfortunately, he went straight from Cross Creek to Bosnia. He wants to spend some quality time with Shayne. He said the place is unbelievable and that Shayne is working so hard.",
        "Sandy: How is Shayne, having him there?",
        "Reva: Well Josh is the low-key parent remember. (Laughs) Actually, I'm here for one reason and one reason only: I forgot to put that in the file for Bill, that information.",
        "Sandy: Oh. Not a problem. Done. Anything else, or...?",
        "Reva: You tell me.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Well, you know something? I've been around, and I can handle anything. Nothing you could say will shock me.",
        "Sandy: What if I said that I killed somebody?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "JB: You know, for all you know, I could be a serial killer. I don't blame you if you want to book.",
        "Tammy: Are you trying to scare me?",
        "JB: No. I'm just giving you the option to back out. You know, you can walk away, no hard feelings.",
        "Tammy: Okay, I know we just met, but it doesn't feel like that. Somehow, you always seem to know what I'm thinking. I...I really want to be with you.",
        "JB: That's all I wanted to hear.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Is that what this is about? Have you hurt somebody?",
        "Sandy: Come on, Reva. It was just an example of how much you don't know about me. I've been on my own for years.",
        "Reva: Yes. And those are years that I want to make up for. Please.",
        "Sandy: It doesn't work like that. You are a great mother, Reva, but this time your sensor is a little off. I have everything under control. Don't worry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "JB: You ready?",
        "Tammy: Yeah. Did you bring, um... Protection?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Well, I guess I can't protect you for the rest of your life, so I'm just going to have to trust you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "JB: Trust me. I know what I'm doing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Trust is what a family is all about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "JB: Don't worry. I'm not ready to have a family yet either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Why don't you call one of your other kids and mess with them? I'm out of here.",
        "Reva: Sandy!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: JB JB",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I'm going to go out to the farm and check on Tammy. You want to come along? It's just that she's been out there all by herself all day long, and I'm worried about her with the whole Dinah thing.",
        "Sandy: Okay, okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "JB: Okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: I know how Tammy feels about Dinah. She's more freaked out than I've ever seen her. In I hate the idea of her being out there all by herself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Nice shot, huh? I just wanted to make sure it was loaded.",
        "Dinah: You're insane.",
        "Cassie: Takes one to know one.",
        "Dinah: We're a lot alike, you and me. You know that?",
        "Cassie: I'm nothing like you.",
        "Dinah: Oh, God. Get over yourself, please. People are people, and they get their backs caught up against the wall and they snap, and they grab a gun, and in the blink of an eye, their lives will change forever. There's a fine line between normal and crazy, and we both have crossed it.",
        "Cassie: You killed out of rage and spite. I'll do it to save my family. And your time is up. Say hello to Hart for me. Oh, I'm sorry. You won't be seeing him where you're going.",
        "Dinah: Don't do this. Don't.",
        "Cassie: I hope God can forgive you, because I can't.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, don't!",
        "Dinah: (Screaming)",
        "Jeffrey: What's going on?",
        "Cassie: I kidnapped Dinah, and now I'm going to kill her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: You know I refinished this myself. It took me about twice as long as I thought it would. This dent... When Selena dropped the microwave. Selena, and oh here, this, your daughter Susan did this showing off for her boyfriend. I forget what his name was, with a butcher knife, no less. Let's see.",
        "Harley: Max.",
        "Buzz: \"Max loves Susan.\"",
        "Harley: It doesn't say, \"Susan loves max\"?",
        "Buzz: No, it says, \"Max loves Susan.\" She put a positive spin on it. She got that from her mother. Which I'm going to do tonight. Okay, everybody, we're... I'm going to cook a feast that will put our Greek ancestors to shame. Come here buddy. Come on.",
        "Zach: Burgers, right, Grandpa?",
        "Coop: I'll get him. I'll get him.",
        "Buzz: I've got him. You go outside, sweep up the mess you made. Thanks for getting us in. He grew up in Europe.",
        "Lizzie: Whoa. Did somebody break in?",
        "Coop: No. Your father locked us out so I just created a new entrance.",
        "Lizzie: Oh. Well, do you know if Tammy and Joey are inside? Hello? Are Tammy...",
        "Coop: Look, I heard what you said. I don't know who those people are.",
        "Lizzie: You know, would it kill you to be a little bit friendlier?",
        "Coop: You want friendly? Why don't you just go someplace else? Right now, you're trespassing, little Miss Lizzie. So why don't you go ahead and just take your precious behind and just get off my porch before I sweep it off. Spaulding's are no longer welcome in this establishment.",
        "Lizzie: You know what? I can't help what my Dad's business decisions are. And you know what? Who are you to talk? You didn't even come home until your father had a heart attack. Oh, did I strike a nerve? Darn.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: All right, so what's up? How closer are we to burying your ex-husband?",
        "Olivia: We need a few more signatures.",
        "Harley: Well, then let's get them. We don't have a lot of time here.",
        "Olivia: I'm sorry, Harley, but I don't think we're going to be able to stage a takeover by Friday.",
        "Bill: But miracles do happen, right, Olivia?",
        "Olivia: It was a miracle that I got out of Denmark. I'm sure if Phillip had had his way, I would have been there much, much longer. How did you clear my visa, by the way?",
        "Harley: You are not going to believe it.",
        "Bill: Harley really brushed up on her detective skills and did a little snooping.",
        "Harley: Yeah, I guess I was just lucky. Or maybe it's experience, you know? I know how those Spaulding men treat their ex-wives.",
        "Olivia: Oh, tell me about it. I'm sure if Phillip had his way, we'd all be separated from our kids. Would you excuse me? I just want to splash a little water on my face. It's been a long trip.",
        "Harley: You didn't tell her about Ruth.",
        "Bill: I'm going to tell her. She's just a little jet-lagged. I'm going to wait, that's all.",
        "Harley: You're not going to tell her. You don't trust Olivia.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Knocking on door) Tammy: Oh, my God.",
        "JB: Oh, but don't worry about it. They'll go away.",
        "Reva: Tammy? Honey, it's me. Tammy? Are you in there?",
        "Tammy: It's my Aunt Reva. She'll kill me if she finds you in here.",
        "Reva: Yoo-hoo.",
        "JB: Calm down. Nobody is going to see me.",
        "Tammy: Hi, Aunt Reva.",
        "Sandy: Hey.",
        "Reva: What took you so long?",
        "Tammy: I was just reading a book. I guess I dozed off for a while.",
        "Reva: Oh. Well, you look flushed.",
        "Sandy: Yeah. And what's with the music and all the candles?",
        "Tammy: Well, I was just trying to relax and get my head off of things.",
        "Reva: Well, good. That's why we're here. We wanted to see if you wanted to come back to the house with the two of us.",
        "Sandy: Huh?",
        "Tammy: Oh. Thanks, no. I'm fine out here by myself, really. I am. It's not like I'm out here obsessing over Dinah or something. I'm keeping myself busy.",
        "Sandy: And we'll keep you busier. Come on, I'll help you pack.",
        "Tammy: No, no. I just...I really want to spend some time alone. Next time, huh?",
        "Reva: Well, we're just concerned about you, sweetie. I mean I know you just broke up with Joey.",
        "Tammy: And I'm fine with it, okay? No big deal.",
        "Sandy: News to me.",
        "Tammy: If Joey doesn't want to be with me, that's his loss, okay? There are plenty of other guys who do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Cassie?",
        "Cassie: Stay back. I have to do this.",
        "Edmund: Just put down the gun. If you make this mistake, you're going to regret it for the rest of your life, so just put down the gun.",
        "Cassie: No. It's too late.",
        "Edmund: No, Cassie, it's not too late. Think of RJ and Tammy and Will. What are they going to do if their mother is in prison? Just put down the gun.",
        "Jeffrey: Shoot her, Cassie. Just do it. Just shoot her. Just shoot. Just pull the trigger, okay, and it's over.",
        "Dinah: Shut up! Brad Radice here from News 42 Sports Today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Bill, I had my reservations about working with Olivia from day one, but I trusted you, and I thought if you trusted her, it would work out.",
        "Bill: I trust her, I do. It's just; give her a little time to breathe, that's all.",
        "Harley: Why? You think she'll think we're nuts or something?",
        "Bill: No, not necessarily. It's just... Listen; let me handle Olivia, all right? I know her a little better than you do.",
        "Harley: No kidding.",
        "Bill: No kidding.",
        "Harley: How can you do that? How can you be with a woman that you don't even trust?",
        "Bill: I trust her, I do.",
        "Harley: You have a pattern of being with really weird women. I hate to say that.",
        "Bill: Yes, well, I am open-minded.",
        "Harley: There was Beth, there was Eden. Now Olivia?",
        "Bill: First of all, Olivia and I are not \"together.\" We're just mixing a little business with pleasure, that's all.",
        "Harley: Oh, you're just using her. Okay, now I respect you.",
        "Bill: I'm kidding.",
        "Harley: You've got to keep your head in the game with me, okay? I mean Ruth can only survive so long before she actually murders her boss, and then where will we be?",
        "Bill: \"Kill Phil\": Now, there is an interesting idea.",
        "Harley: \"Kill Phil.\"",
        "Olivia: I had it first.",
        "Harley: I'm just kidding. I don't actually want to kill Phillip. I want him to suffer.",
        "Olivia: Oh, he's going to suffer. Once slingshot makes its bid for control of Spaulding, he's going to be bussing tables at Company. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Oh. This is so good.",
        "Harley: Well, good.",
        "Olivia: I'm just starved for anything American.",
        "Harley: Well, yeah, speaking of starving, that looks great. I am going to get some food. Do you want something?",
        "Bill: Uh...",
        "Harley: I'll get you something.",
        "Bill: Okay. Okay, so listen. We've got a list of stockholders. Any way we can save this company, here?",
        "Olivia: You're going to have to look at the big picture. This little guy, he's company, right? Sad, but it's not that difficult to swallow. See?",
        "Bill: Mm-hmm.",
        "Olivia: Now this one, this is Spaulding. This is the mother of all potatoes. You control this you control everything.",
        "Bill: Okay, you're talking potatoes; I'm talking about people.",
        "Olivia: All right, look. Why don't we just focus on what I accomplished on my trip?",
        "Bill: All right. Well, I'd love to get a look at that list of stockholders.",
        "Olivia: Well, I'd love to show them to you, but don't you think we should go somewhere a little more private?",
        "Bill: Maybe my place? Champagne? Hm? Hm? Twist my arm. Come on, let's go.",
        "Olivia: Don't you want to have dinner first?",
        "Bill: How about we order in? That okay?",
        "Olivia: Mm-hmm.",
        "Bill: Come on. Later Lizzie.",
        "Olivia: Careful, Coop. Bye.",
        "Coop: Look, don't you have some kind of road trip with Lionel Ritchie's daughter to be on right now?",
        "Lizzie: You just might be the rudest guy I've ever met.",
        "Coop: Oh. Come on, now. I only do it because I like you.",
        "Lizzie: Really?",
        "Coop: No. No. I give you a hard time because you're a spoiled little brat and your family is a den of vampires.",
        "Lizzie: You know, you can act like you're the big defender of the Cooper family, but you're not fooling anyone.",
        "Coop: (Laughs)",
        "Lizzie: Coop, you barely even know those people. And you're a terrible waiter, on top of it.",
        "Coop: You know, I just figured out what's wrong with you.",
        "Lizzie: What's wrong with... Really? What's that?",
        "Coop: You need a guy. Desperately. I mean desperation is just written all over your face.",
        "Lizzie: Don't. Let go of me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "JB: Such a wonderful family. Oh, well. Party's over, Sandy.",
        "Reva: That's what I'd like to hear. I mean why mope around over one guy when there's a whole world of possibilities just waiting around the corner?",
        "Tammy: And maybe even closer than that.",
        "Reva: Yeah! I mean, I have to admit that I did think that Joey was the beat- all and end-all, but if you're really serious about moving ahead, then there's one or two boys that I'd be able to...",
        "Tammy: Oh, no you don't, Aunt Reva. You can just stay out of it.",
        "Reva: Now you're starting to sound just like my son.",
        "Sandy: Reva, apparently Tammy wants to be just by herself. So why don't we let her enjoy her music and candles?",
        "Reva: Okay. Okay, fine. But if you need anything, you be sure to let me know.",
        "Tammy: I'll call you. I promise, I'll call you if you need anything. I promise, I'll call you if I need anything.",
        "Reva: Okay.",
        "Tammy: All right, bye. Bye, Aunt Reva.",
        "Reva: I love you, sweetie.",
        "Tammy: Thank you. You, too. Bye, my freakish cousin.",
        "Sandy: Love you, too! What?",
        "Reva: What? What are you doing?",
        "Sandy: I'm just double-checking. I want Tammy to be safe.",
        "Reva: Oh, you're such a good boy.",
        "JB: Too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Go ahead, Cassie. Do it. Pull the trigger. End it right now. Get out of the way, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: For God's sake, what are you doing? Don't listen to him, Cassie.",
        "Jeffrey: If she wants justice, this is how she can have it. You can have it right now, Cassie. Just shoot. Just pull the trigger, okay, and it's over. I'm the DA. I can get you through any trial, no problem. You'll do no jail time, okay? There's only four witnesses here--well, make that three, okay?--And we can spin it any way we want.",
        "Dinah: Jeffrey, what are you talking about?",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, listen. Listen. We can say any story; any story will work because it's going to be obvious self-defense. All of Springfield will buy it, okay? And if you're worried about your children, we can shield them from the media, okay? It's not a problem. All you have to do is just pull the trigger. Just do it. Do it now!",
        "Dinah: Shut up! Shut up! What are you doing? What is this, like some reverse psychology? Would you stop the tricks?",
        "Jeffrey: It's not a trick. Cassie, go ahead.",
        "Dinah: No, don't do that. No! He will twist this on you so badly you won't know what hit you. You kill me, you kill yourself. My father will make sure of that. I'm not lying to you. I'm telling you the truth. I'm begging you.",

        "Jeffrey: That's right. This is her decision. You've got the gun, Cassie. No one can take it away from you. No one can stop you, okay? This is your call.",

        "Olivia: Are you interested or not?",
        "Bill: I'm very, very interested. Very. In fact, we need every vote we can get to make Spaulding lay down. Down, down, down. Now, why don't you just whisper a name in my ear?",
        "Olivia: Well, I have to get them first. Let's have some more champagne, huh?",

        "Buzz: Well, you know, you're your father's daughter. You're stubborn and proud. You want things your own way. Things could be worse.",

As an officer, you are sworn n the courtroom to protect, and all you did was egg her on and on. Unless you were trying to save me. Is that what you were trying to do? Do you talk? Fine. Fine. I'm free. That's all I care about. And if Cassie tries to press charges on me now, I will charge her so fast with that gun she just pulled on me. Where are you going? Jeffrey!
