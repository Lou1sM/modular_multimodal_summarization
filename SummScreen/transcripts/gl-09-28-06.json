        "Lizzie: Jonathan, you know, look what Aunt\r\nIndia gave us. Service for 12 in our pattern. ",
        "Jonathan: \"Our\" pattern? There's\r\nno us, Lizzie. ",
        "Lizzie: Well, that's not what our marriage\r\ncertificate says. Okay, for appearance sake you have to at least pretend to be\r\nexcited about stuff like this. ",
        "Jonathan: Appearance sake? Nobody could see\r\nus in here. I have to find a way to see Tammy today. ",
        "",
        "Dr. Baker: Visiting your boyfriend, Ms.\r\nWinslow? ",
        "Tammy: Stay out of my way. (Pounding on\r\ndoor) It's Tammy. Open up. (Pounding on door) You heard me. Open the door. \r\n",
        "Jonathan: Tammy, what are you doing? ",
        "Tammy: You're married now. I'm on my own. So\r\nwhen you are going to keep your promise and get the rest of your junk out of my\r\nroom? I told you I want your stuff... ",
        "",
        "Ava: Good. I need you to go somewhere with\r\nme. ",
        "Coop: We're going to press charges against\r\nOlivia for trying to run you over? ",
        "Ava: No, we haven't made a decision about\r\nOlivia yet. This is about Emma. ",
        "Coop: What about her? ",
        "Ava: I haven't seen her since she woke up,\r\nsince she got out of the hospital. ",
        "Coop: Okay, Ava... whoa, whoa, whoa. That\r\nwas not your fault, okay? Let's not go back there. ",
        "Ava: Oh, no. I just need to see her, okay? ",
        "Coop: Exactly. And Ava, seeing her means\r\nyou're going to be seeing Olivia. Mm-mmm. No. ",
        "Ava: I checked at the front desk. She's\r\ngoing to be out for a while. ",
        "Coop: This is bad. All right, this is bad.\r\nI'm just saying it's got bad written all over it. ",
        "Ava: It's not bad. Okay, if you don't want\r\nto go with me, cool. I'll go by myself. ",
        "Coop: Oh, don't do that. ",
        "Ava: So are you going to go with me? ",
        "Coop: I... ",
        "Ava: I'll take that as a yes. ",
        "Coop: Ava, this is bad. ",
        "Ava: Yes. ",

        "Olivia: Hi. ",
        "Buzz: Hey. ",
        "Olivia: Got my message? ",
        "Buzz: Yeah. ",
        "Olivia: We have to get through this. Please,\r\nI need for us to get through this. Is that the brochure for the Restaurant\r\nOwners Convention in New Orleans? ",
        "Buzz: Yeah. I decided to go. ",
        "Olivia: Good. Good. You know, I... it's not\r\ntoo late. I could still book a flight, grab Emma. It could be a little mini\r\nvacation for us. ",
        "Buzz: No, no. ",
        "Olivia: Why no? ",
        "Buzz: Because I'm going alone. ",
        "Olivia: Why? ",
        "Buzz: (Sighs) I've been going through\r\nstuff in my head and I just... I... I think we need to take a break. ",

        "Gus: Yo! Rookie. ",
        "Harley: Hope it's caffeine in that cup. ",
        "Remy: I'm sorry, okay. Listen, it's dead out\r\nhere. Since I started my shift, I've filled out two pooper scooper\r\nviolations, okay? ",
        "Gus: What's the matter? Now you don't like\r\nanimals? ",
        "Remy: I'm still trying to figure how Marina got\r\nthe good assignment this week and I got stuff doing... ",
        "Harley: Because Marina was the one who\r\nfigured out that the Springfieldburns.com web site was coming out of a server\r\nin Chicago. Now, if you'd done your... ",
        "Remy: I could have figured that out myself. ",
        "Gus: My dear young eager lad. I know that\r\nthe... the cross to bear of the PSP, Pooper Scoop\r\nPatrol, it's a tough one. It's a tough one to bear. But while protecting the\r\nfair citizens of our little 'burb, no job is too demeaning. ",
        "Remy: Okay, I'm going to leave before I gag.\r\n",
        "Gus: You didn't say \"May I?\" ",
        "Remy: May I? ",
        "Gus: There you go! Now you can go ahead. Go.\r\n",
        "Harley: You are so mean to him! ",
        "Gus: He's a rookie. Break him in. ",
        "Harley: You got a point. I mean, what I\r\nwouldn't give for, like, a bank robbery, a good mugging-- I mean, where nobody\r\ngets hurt, of course. ",
        "Gus: A kid just shoplifting a little candy,\r\n'cause then you get to keep the candy. ",
        "Harley: True, true, true. Something.\r\nAnything. ",

        "Dinah: Jeffrey? Jeffrey? What the hell? Come\r\non. If this is a joke, it's not even funny. ",
        "",
        "Olivia: Well, you know, \"Taking a\r\nbreak\" is really just a euphemism for saying good-bye. ",
        "Buzz: No. If that's what I wanted to say, I\r\nwould have said it. ",
        "Olivia: Look, who got to you. All right? I\r\nmean, I am this terrible monster who tried to run Ava down in this car, so you\r\njust... ",
        "Buzz: No, I do my own thinking, and my\r\nthinking right now is when we're together, that puts you more in the orbit with\r\nCoop than with Ava, and so I think I'm just going to remove myself from the\r\nequation. ",
        "Olivia: To get away from me. ",
        "Buzz: No, so things can calm down. ",
        "Olivia: You're running away. ",
        "Buzz: I'm not running away. ",
        "Olivia: Come on, don't do this, all right?\r\nDon't make it worse. If you want to job... ",
        "Buzz: How could it get much worse? You\r\nalmost ran somebody over with a car! Look, you know how I feel about... I love\r\nyou. I want to make things good for everyone. I'd do anything to make you\r\nhappy. But there are people involved in here-- I mean, human beings. Ava's got\r\nto be safe, too, all right? Okay? So make it right. Just make it right. ",
        "Olivia: Thanks, Ava. Once again, this is all\r\nyour fault. ",

        "Jane: Ms. Spencer didn't say anything about\r\nvisitors today. ",
        "Ava: Is Emma napping? I can wait if she is. ",
        "Emma: Ava! ",
        "Ava: Oh, hi! How are you, Emma? I'm so happy\r\nto see you. ",
        "Coop: She looks pretty glad to see you, too.\r\n",
        "Ava: How are you? Who is this? Is this your\r\nlittle Bobo Bunny? ",
        "Emma: He's cute. ",
        "Coop: Look, as you can see, Emma\u2019s pretty\r\nexcited to see Ava. Do you think you could just give us maybe a couple of\r\nminutes alone? ",
        "Jane: All right. Just a few minutes. ",
        "Coop: Thank you. ",
        "Ava: So hey, I wanted to have a little chat\r\nwith you and talk to you about something that's bothering me, okay? It's\r\nsomething I feel bad about. Do you remember the last time we saw each other and\r\nyou drank my perfume and you got sick? Remember that? I was supposed to be\r\nwatching over you, baby, and I didn\u2019t. I didn't do a good job. I was supposed\r\nto be protecting you, and I'm sorry. I love you, okay? I'm sorry. Okay? Do you\r\nwant me to read you some of that book? Hey, this is the same book that I read\r\nto you last time, right? Remember that? I think I know your favorite part.\r\nWould you like me to read it to you? ",
        "Coop: You know, you guys are absolutely\r\namazing together. ",
        "Ava: Ever since I laid eyes on this little\r\nmunchkin, I don't know, there's some kind of a connection we have. Right?\r\nBecause you're so special and cute. ",

        "Jonathan: Takes one to know one, babe! ",
        "Tammy: What is wrong with you? God, I missed\r\nyou. ",
        "Jonathan: Well, I feel the same way about\r\nyou! And I'm going to prove it to you. ",
        "Lizzie: This is never going to work. Baker's\r\nnot that stupid. Tammy, you have to go. Can you guys hear me? Dr. Baker is\r\nright outside listening. ",
        "Jonathan: Okay, you keep yelling and then\r\nbreak something. ",
        "Tammy: I am done with you! Do you hear me? ",
        "Lizzie: No. Not that. Give it to me. ",
        "Jonathan: Update. He bought it. He moved all\r\nthe way down to the other end of the hallway. You, Tammy Winslow, are a\r\ncertified genius. Beautiful and brilliant. Hey, Lizzie, you were going to go\r\ntake a shower and get dressed, right? ",
        "Lizzie: I was",

        "Harley: 10-4, we're at the location. ",

        "Harley: You all right? ",
        "Dinah: Yeah, fine. You guys alone? ",
        "Harley: Yeah. Got a call there was a\r\ndisturbance. ",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Somebody broke in while I was\r\nsleeping, and they left me this. ",
        "Harley: Hmm! ",
        "Dinah: I think it's the person behind that\r\nstupid web site. ",
        "Harley: Hmm. Can you give me a description? ",
        "Dinah: Well, I didn't see them. I was\r\nsleeping. I thought it was Jeffrey, but when I sat up, whoever it was took a\r\npicture of me. The flash blinded me and they ran out. I... I thought that the\r\n\"Springfield Burns\" was somebody else's case? ",
        "Harley: Yeah, we were in the neighborhood,\r\nso we got the call. ",
        "Dinah: Well, lucky me. ",
        "Gus: Anything seem different to you or\r\nrearranged at all? ",
        "Dinah: The only thing that is different is\r\nthat-- which is my very expensive lipstick, by the way. ",
        "Gus: Shame, shame, shame. ",
        "Harley: So somebody shows up here with the\r\nintention of writing something on the walls and neglects to bring their own\r\nwriting utensil? It's kind of poor planning, wouldn't you say? ",
        "Dinah: You'd have to ask them. ",
        "Gus: No sign of forced entry. ",
        "Harley: None here, either. ",
        "Dinah: Okay, so what's with the looks? Who\r\ndo you think did this? ",
        "Gus: We have a theory. ",
        "Dinah: You want to tell me? ",
        "Harley: It's just that you looked pretty\r\ndisappointed when you opened the door and we were standing there. And given the\r\nlack of evidence, we're just wondering if maybe you did all of this trying to\r\nget Mallet to race over and rescue you. ",
        "Dinah: Gosh, you're right, Harley. You figured\r\nme out. Guess that's why you left Spaulding and went back to police work,\r\nbecause it's in your blood. (Phone rings) That's right. I thought up this\r\nwhole convoluted scheme just so I could get Mallet in here. Because that's what\r\nI want, my ex back into my life. And why do I want my ex back into my life? I\r\ncan't remember. What was that part? ",
        "Harley: So you could shove it into his face\r\nthat you've moved on. ",
        "Dinah: No. No, because that would require me\r\nwanting to be in the same room with him, and I don't want to be within a mile\r\nfrom the guy. What I would like is this crazy person, whoever this crazy person\r\nis, to stop hovering over me while I sleep. ",
        "Harley: Of course. But you did look\r\ndisappointed when you opened the door and Mallet wasn't standing there. ",
        "Gus: Well, that was Mallet. He's in Chicago,\r\nand they're not having any look tracking down that server. ",
        "Dinah: Why is Mallet in Chicago? ",
        "Gus: Marina got a tip that the server is\r\nprobably being redirected from an address in Las Vegas, so... ",
        "Harley: They're working. ",
        "Dinah: Whatever. I've moved on. I told you\r\nboth that. ",
        "Gus: Should we go? ",
        "Dinah: Yeah. I think you should go, find the\r\nblogger ASAP and keep me in the loop, okay? ",
        "Harley: Deadbolt the door. Why? Why, why\r\nwould you mention that Marina and Mallet are in Chicago together? She doesn't\r\nhave to know that. ",
        "Gus: Well, she says she didn't care. ",
        "Harley: Honey, you have so much to learn\r\nabout women. ",

        "Tammy: Is Lizzie in the shower? ",
        "Jonathan: Finally. We get some time alone\r\ntogether. Nice work on faking out the doc today. Do you think you could do the\r\nsame thing tonight so we could have some more time together? ",
        "Tammy: I have a better idea, which is why I\r\ncame, so I could tell you. ",
        "Jonathan: Do you think you could tell me the\r\nidea with your clothes off? ",
        "Tammy: Stop it. Stop it. Seriously. ",
        "Jonathan: Seriously. ",
        "Tammy: Seriously, I wrote this huge paper\r\nfor my Psych Class, and my professor liked it so much that he's publishing it\r\nin the Campus Quarterly. ",
        "Jonathan: Nice! Look at you! ",
        "Tammy: Yeah, look at me. ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah! (Laughs) I am looking. You\r\nthink we can celebrate the way we usually celebrate? ",
        "Tammy: Okay, down boy, down boy. Lizzie\r\ntakes quick showers. Having a party on Main Street tonight for everyone who's getting\r\npublished. I want you to come.\r\nIt's kind of a big night for me. ",
        "Jonathan: Do I have to keep my distance? ",
        "Tammy: Maybe we could sneak a few moments.\r\nSound good? ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. ",
        "Lizzie: Oh, joy. A party. Can't wait. ",
        "Jonathan: Hey, about the paper, that's\r\nreally good for you. Congratulations. ",
        "Tammy: Thanks. Yeah. You know, I almost\r\ndidn't get it in in time. I was actually really\r\nstruggling with it, but then Remy showed up and helped me out. He was actually\r\nreally great about it. ",
        "Jonathan: That was nice of him. ",
        "Tammy: We had dinner at Rick and Mel\u2019s, too.\r\n",
        "Jonathan: Really? ",
        "Tammy: Yeah. It's been a while since I've\r\nbeen around a family like that. Normal. I guess Remy could tell I needed that. \r\n",

        "Coop: You know, guys, I don't think we have\r\nany more time for that today. Because you, little lady, we've got to get back\r\nto bed and finish up your nap so that way you are all rested by the time mommy\r\ngets home. ",
        "Ava: Mommy. Yes. Mommy, mommy, good idea. I\r\nthink Coop is right. I think it's time for us to go. But how about if I come\r\nback real soon and read to you again? Would you like that? I would like that. \r\n",

        "Jonathan: Did I tell you that you could come\r\nin? ",
        "Remy: Do you want me to wonder why I can't? ",
        "Jonathan: Enter, Officer. Investigate.\r\nSearch for her. Get your jollies. She's not here. It's just me and the dog.\r\nWifey's out shopping, and the shouting that the neighbors heard before was\r\nTammy and me. We were just creating a row to distract Alan\u2019s goon. ",
        "Remy: Is that right? ",
        "Jonathan: Mm-hmm. Tammy's idea, too. It's a\r\ngood feeling when your girlfriend will go above and beyond to be able to spend\r\nsome time with you. ",
        "Remy: Oh. Oh, see, most guys I know would\r\nfeel pretty crappy about putting their girlfriends through this. But then\r\nagain, most guys I know actually give a damn about their girlfriend's feelings.\r\n",

        "Tammy: Reading? Marvel comics or something? ",
        "Lizzie: (Laughs) No! It's a book that my mom\r\ngot for him. It's for expectant dads. It's all about birth and the first year\r\nof the baby's life. It's so cute. It's like Jonathan\u2019s cramming for a test. \r\n(Giggles) ",
        "Tammy: Really? ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. I mean, he probably didn't\r\ntell you because he's embarrassed about what a softy he's become, but at night\r\nhe talks to the baby in my tummy. ",
        "Tammy: What did you buy? ",
        "Lizzie: Returning stuff. Wedding presents.\r\nOh! Okay, don't tell Jonathan, but with the money, I'm going to buy him leather\r\nsaddle bags for his motorcycle. ",
