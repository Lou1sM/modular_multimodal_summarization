        "Sebastian: It's quite a shock, I know. Just wish I'd found someway to cushion the blow.",
        "Blake: My father's dead. There's no way to cushion that. I never thought that he wouldn't live forever.",
        "Sebastian: Yeah, he was larger than life.",
        "Blake: That phrase doesn't even do him justice. To some people, Roger Thorpe was the devil incarnate. But to me...",
        "Sebastian: He was still your father.",
        "Blake: Yes. I hadn't seen him in a long time, but still I just couldn't imagine the world without him.",
        "Holly: Blake?",
        "Blake: Oh, mom. (Crying)",
        "Holly: Blake. Oh, sweetie. Oh, sweetie. I got your message. Who is he? Why in the world should we believe Roger is dead because this person says so?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zach: No, I don't want to stay here with you. You're mean.",
        "Ross: Hello, Phillip. Phillip?",
        "Phillip: Oh, Ross, I'm sorry. Thank you for coming. It's good to see you. How are things?",
        "Ross: Great. I'm great. My daughter is a free woman and we were celebrating at Towers.",
        "Phillip: That's wonderful. Congratulations. I'm very happy for you.",
        "Ross: Thank you.",
        "Phillip: Actually, you've helped me broach the subject. It's actually fatherhood that has me tied in knots at the moment. I'm worried about Zach. Harley is using this dispute with Company to try to...",
        "Ross: Whoa. Wait a minute. Now it's a dispute?",
        "Phillip: I beg your pardon?",
        "Ross: I'd say it's more like pillaging or ransacking, wouldn't you say?",
        "Phillip: Well, you can call it whatever you would like. She's using it to poison my son against me and I will not permit it.",
        "Ross: Where's my involvement?",
        "Phillip: Well, you handle the divorce. The first thing I need to do is take a look at that paperwork.",
        "Ross: Okay, I see where you're going with this.",
        "Phillip: Great. You stay a few steps ahead of me. That will save us all time.",
        "Ross: And my advice to you is don't go there.",
        "Phillip: Well, that's advice that I can't use, Ross.",
        "Ross: Well, that's the only kind you're going to get from me, because, believe it or not, I have your best interest at heart.",
        "Alan: Ross, don't be such a hypocrite. We're all fathers here. But put that aside for one moment. If you can keep a murderer out of jail, you can help Phillip with his son.",
        "Edmund: What are you doing here?",
        "Dinah: I came to see you.",
        "Edmund: Good, and now that you have, good-bye.",
        "Dinah: Cassie's out of town getting some r & r, the children are gone. Who am I bothering?",
        "Edmund: Me. And more important, you're the reason Cassie's out of town in the first place.",
        "Dinah: I hope she's all right.",
        "Edmund: What the hell do you care how she is?",
        "Dinah: Look, I know this sounds a little strange, but I do care about Cassie. She could have executed me on that cliff and she didn't. Do you know what it's like to stare down the barrel of a gun and know that any second the last things you see could be the last things you see?",
        "Edmund: Cassie didn't pull the trigger.",
        "Dinah: No. You and Jeffrey are the only things that stopped her. Do you think she had some sudden crisis of conscience? No, she wanted me dead, Edmund. I'm very thankful for the second chance and I was just hoping to take something good from the whole ordeal.",
        "Edmund: Really? What would that be?",
        "Dinah: You.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: I didn't want to believe it either, Mom.",
        "Holly: I'm not so sure you should.",
        "Blake: Why would anybody make up such a thing?",
        "Holly: Run down the list of all the things your father has done in his life and then ask that question. If Roger was ill, deathly ill, why didn't we hear from him?",
        "Sebastian: Would you like to hear from him now?",
        "Holly: Okay. Here we go. Now what? You wheel in a cake and Roger pops out? No, no, no, this is a scene from \"Hamlet,\" and Roger is somewhere behind a curtain.",
        "Blake: What do you mean, \"hear from him,\" Sebastian?",
        "Sebastian: Roger liked to leave a great big footprint wherever he went. He wanted somehow to reach out and touch everyone who came in contact with him.",
        "Blake: That's one way of putting it.",
        "Sebastian: And in the end, he finally freed himself from all the appetites that he had in this life.",
        "Holly: (laughs) Well, now I know you are lying.",
        "Sebastian: But even at the end, he still had that certain energy about him, you know. But he was less urgent. He began to find peace. Wouldn't you have wanted that for him, Holly?",
        "Holly: I suppose. I just don't think it would be possible.",
        "Sebastian: His life force was ebbing, but it was bright and shining and it flashed right before me, right before my eyes, just as he died. It was glorious, and Holly he wanted you there by his side. Oh, you and Chrissie. He wanted you to forgive him and he wanted to look into your eyes and see the best part of him.",
        "Blake: That's beautiful.",
        "Holly: I don't mean to be rude, but...",
        "Sebastian: And you know what? He also knew how you would react, how you just might react. Chrissie's heart would be open. Holly would be a skeptic.",
        "Holly: Death certificate.",
        "Blake: It has his name on it.",
        "Holly: These can be faked.",
        "Blake: It said he died of natural causes.",
        "Sebastian: Yeah.",
        "Blake: That's not how my father's suppose to die. He's suppose to die skydiving or hunting tigers or leading rebel troops into battle.",
        "Holly: Roger was capable of so many things larger than life and death. Every time I thought he was gone, he found his way back.",
        "Sebastian: I think you should hear from him now. \"My dear, Chrissie, my beloved Holly, the indications are clear that I am not long for this world. But about the time you hear this, I will have passed on. Hard as it is to believe, I have no misgivings about the life I lived. I have regrets. How I hurt you, Holly, on that terrible night all those years ago. How I missed out on all those years of your life, Chrissie. But the sum of my life in total was a journey through the raging fires of a desire for all things good. My idea of what was good in other people just never seemed to match. My love for you both is deathless. Never forget how much I loved you, Chrissie. You gave my life meaning, purpose. And in you and your beautiful children my life goes on. Never forget how much I loved you, Chrissie. You will make mistakes as I did, but forgive yourself everything and never let it diminish your passion for life. Holly, I know you loved me. I know you hated me. But if there are stars in the night sky, then we belong there--darkness and light forever. The best of me has always been you both. My daughter, my Chrissie. My eternal love, my Holly. Forever yours, Roger.\" (Blake cries uncontrollably)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: Alan, I didn't say that I wouldn't help Phillip, but I didn't come here to take orders from you.",
        "Alan: Tell me something. How much did we contribute to your campaign, Ross?",
        "Ross: (laughs) Oh, the bill has come due already, huh? What do you think you're entitled to?",
        "Phillip: All right. Okay. Hang on just a second. If we could...",
        "Alan: No one is assuming...",
        "Phillip: If we could please uncross our signals here for just a second. That's not what this is about. I am looking to you as my personal attorney and as my friend.",
        "Ross: That's okay. That's fine.",
        "Phillip: Okay.",
        "Ross: That fine. But if you have business with the mayor, you make an appointment just like everybody else.",
        "Phillip: Fine. Fair enough.",
        "Ross: So my advice to you as your personal attorney is--get over it, Phillip. Whatever it may be. Because in the last few weeks you have been on a rampage going beyond just doing business. The whole town is turning against you.",
        "Phillip: Well, that's fine, Ross. I can deal with the whole town turning against me. What I can't deal with is my son being turned against me, which is what Harley and her clan are doing. He is starting to hate his father.",
        "Alan: Ross, tell me what would happen if we open the custody case?",
        "Ross: Oh, I don't know. Just off the top of my head, I don't think it would endear him to Harley or any of the Cooper's.",
        "Phillip: Well, that doesn't particularly concern me.",
        "Ross: Yeah, I sense that in you. On the other hand, though, think of what an extended custody battle would do to your son. And as for full custody, that would be very difficult because Harley is a good mother.",
        "Phillip: I'm not interested in full custody.",
        "Ross: Then why reopen the case at all?",
        "Phillip: I have my reasons. Please have your office deliver a copy of the divorce settlement before end of business today.",
        "Ross: Phillip, are you sure that you want to do this, because...",
        "Phillip: Ross, I value your council. I value your love and your friendship. But on this issue, you are either with me or you are against me.",
        "Edmund: Forgive me if I didn't make myself clear at every point, but I'm off limits, too.",
        "Dinah: I didn't mean I wanted you that way, although I am offended you aren't a little... A little bit interested.",
        "Edmund: Good-bye, Dinah Marler.",
        "Dinah: Oh, we don't have a sense of humor? That's okay. That's all right. I want to thank you just the same.",
        "Edmund: For what?",
        "Dinah: Cassie could have killed me, but you convinced her not to.",
        "Edmund: Actually, I was resisting the urge to root for her to pull the trigger, what with the trial that would ensue and the children to think about.",
        "Dinah: Well, committing murder can do a whole lot to a girl.",
        "Edmund: Yes, well, look what it did to you.",
        "Dinah: I'm better now, now that I've met you. You've gotten to know me and you've seen the real me and you've accepted that. Just like I've gotten to know you. We would both do whatever it took to protect the people we love. And you would do whatever it took to keep Cassie safe.",
        "Edmund: Dinah, blackmail can be a very nasty business, especially with someone like me. So, word to the wise: Be careful. If you push me, I'll push back twice as hard.",
        "Ross: For the Spaulding's or against the Spaulding's. Why is it always a blood sport with you people?",
        "Alan: Now, Ross, we've known each other for years. We know each other's history very well. And Phillip and I know what lengths you will go to to protect your child. Why should we be different?",
        "Phillip: Yeah. Let me ask you: When Dinah came back to town, you had no problem keeping your mouth shut, as any good father would.",
        "Ross: There is absolutely no excuse for what I did, but I make no apologies for it, either. If you want to judge me by how much I love my daughter, go ahead, get in line, take a number. I don't recall anybody throwing Lizzie to the wolves when she had legal problems.",
        "Phillip: (scoffs) You want to compare apples and hammers? Let's go ahead. Yes, you're right. Lizzie did kill a man just like Dinah did. Of course, she was eight when she did it and she was defending her mother.",
        "Alan: Gentlemen, look. Look, we're all in agreement that we would do anything to protect our children. Now, all we are asking as friends is for you to help a father with his son.",
        "Ross: All right. (Sighs) what are we dealing with here? I need... (Cell phone ringing) excuse me, I have to take this. Hello? Blake, what is it? Is it Dinah?",
        "Blake: I wish it were. I didn't say anything earlier. I don't know why.",
        "Ross: Didn't say anything about what?",
        "Blake: My father.",
        "Ross: Well, what about Roger?",
        "Blake: He's dead.",
        "Ross: Are you still at Towers?",
        "Holly: Ross?",
        "Ross: Holly. Is it true?",
        "Holly: I don't know. Blake will tell you all about this. We just have to go through this now without you. You understand that?",
        "Ross: Yeah, I do.",
        "Holly: Okay.",
        "Ross: Roger Thorpe is dead.",
        "Alan: (laughs) Well, I never thought I would live to see the day.",
        "Phillip: Are you sure?",
        "Ross: As sure as anybody else is, I guess.",
        "Phillip: Have you heard from Amanda lately?",
        "Alan: Yeah, I told you I spoke with her.",
        "Phillip: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's right.",
        "Alan: They broke up, but I'm sure she knows about this.",
        "Ross: Well, call her. Blake seems to think it's true.",
        "Alan: No, no, no. This is good enough for me. And gentlemen, I think this calls for a Cuban.",
        "Ross: Oh, come on. A celebratory cigar is a little crass, don't you think?",
        "Alan: Oh, come on. Don't give me that malarkey, \"may he rest in peace,\" Ross. Come on. You hated the man as much as I did. Well, maybe not as much as I did, but you did hate him.",
        "Ross: Still, he was Blake's father.",
        "Alan: Well, that was her misfortune.",
        "Ross: Alan, he was a human being.",
        "Phillip: Oh, well. (Laughs) I don't know if we want to go that far.",
        "Alan: (Laughs)",
        "Phillip: You're not actually going to make the case that the world's not a better place without him, are you?",
        "Ross: Well, Phillip, at the rate you're going, people are going to be saying the exact same thing about you.",
        "Phillip: I'll risk it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: Is that him?",
        "Sebastian: He wanted his ashes scattered from the highest point in Springfield, to rain down upon the town that loathed him.",
        "Holly: Now, that's Roger.",
        "Blake: Was it right to tell Ross not to come? I mean, he is my husband, and this is so sudden and impersonal.",
        "Sebastian: No, this is just the way he wanted it. Just the two of you. Roger knew how everyone else in this town would feel about his death.",
        "Holly: They would throw a parade down Fifth Street.",
        "Sebastian: He wanted these last moments to be with the two people who knew him and loved him and understood him despite his demons.",
        "Holly: Understood.",
        "Sebastian: The two people he hoped would forgive him. He didn't want a prayer spoken because he didn't want God to strike anyone down. But he did have a favorite poem. \"I cannot say and I will not say that he is dead. He is just away. With a cheery smile and a wave of the hand, he has wandered into an unknown land and left us dreaming how very fair it needs must be since he lingers there.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Damn!",
        "Phillip: What's wrong?",
        "Alan: I got some ash in my eye.",
        "Phillip: Well, you might want to try standing downwind with that thing.",
        "Alan: Thank you for the tip.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: \"And you, oh you, who the wildest yearn for an old-time step and glad return think of him faring on, dear in love of there as the love of here.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Is that why you think I'm here, to blackmail you?",
        "Edmund: I think you've just admitted as much.",
        "Dinah: (laughs) I'm playing you? Come on, Edmund. I know what you think of me, that I'm a liar, a cheat, a blackmailer. You were kind to me, but I don't think you're a sucker.",
        "Edmund: Dinah, I've been a sucker my whole life and you've seen me at one of my low points.",
        "Dinah: True. Jeffrey O'Neill is lucky to be alive.",
        "Edmund: Well, I dragged him out of the fire, at any rate.",
        "Dinah: Well, he really wouldn't need any saving if you hadn't cracked him over the head.",
        "Edmund: Fine, fine. So, when do you break the story?",
        "Dinah: What makes you think I'm going to do that?",
        "Edmund: You're just biding your time, aren't you? Seeing what you can get for your continued silence?",
        "Dinah: No. Edmund, you and I are my simpatico. I get you. And you're one of the only people in this town that gets me, at least my dark side. Because you have one, too.",
        "Edmund: What are we doing here?",
        "Dinah: I think we're bonding.",
        "Edmund: Why?",
        "Dinah: I don't know. It's what people do.",
        "Edmund: Not us.",
        "Dinah: Wow. We have more in common than you'd like to admit.",
        "Edmund: Which means less to me than I possibly can. Pursue thy conquest, Dinah. Do your worst. Cassie and I will be prepared.",
        "Dinah: You have a flair for the dramatic. Has anybody ever told you that?",
        "Edmund: Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: \"Think of him still as the same. I say he is not dead; he is just away.\"",
        "Holly: Damn you, Roger. Damn you if this isn't true. Damn you if it is.",
        "Sebastian: He, uh... He was a complicated man and he was not always a kind man, but some people are like that, you know? And I was scared of him sometimes, but I know he loved me and I loved him. I loved him. I loved him very much.",
        "Blake: You came into his life at the very end?",
        "Sebastian: It was almost too late before I discovered the truth.",
        "Holly: What truth?",
        "Sebastian: Roger Thorpe was my father.",
        "Blake: You're Roger Thorpe's son?",
        "Sebastian: Yeah.",
        "Holly: This is insane!",
        "Sebastian: Why?",
        "Holly: Because you come here with his ashes and now you're...",
        "Blake: And now you tell me that you're my brother? Shouldn't you have mentioned that at the beginning?",
        "Sebastian: I didn't know how. I didn't... I didn't even know if I was going to tell you at all.",
        "Holly: I'm sorry, Sebastian, for being so harsh. You have to understand, your father was...",
        "Sebastian: I know, I know. I know it doesn't make much sense.",
        "Holly: That poem, though. That was his favorite poem. You seem to know so much.",
        "Blake: How do we know this isn't a scheme?",
        "Sebastian: You don't.",
        "Holly: Frankly, this is just like him. He was so manipulative. A man without a conscience.",
        "Sebastian: It was a beautiful moment.",
        "Holly: What?",
        "Sebastian: Just now. It was beautiful. Letting his ashes go and fulfilling his wishes.",
        "Holly: Roger's wishes.",
        "Sebastian: God, he wanted you here. He wanted you here, Holly. He wanted you to know how much you meant to him. And maybe, you know, maybe we all know something now that we didn't know before about kindness and forgiveness and about... And about love. Angels persist, Holly. Clouds persist. They become storms, they become lakes, and they become clouds again, and they persist because we persist.",
        "Holly: Where do you... Where did you hear that?",
        "Sebastian: From my father.",
        "Holly: He told you about that?",
        "Sebastian: Yes.",
        "Holly: He told you about that and then you come here...",
        "Sebastian: He told me how you were just like him: Protective, passionate, reckless. And Chrissie, he didn't remember you as the wife, as a mother of three. He remembered you as that precious little girl that he took for a moonlit walk on the lake one winter night.",
        "Blake: Stop it. Stop.",
        "Holly: You may remember him with all these golden memories, but I knew him when he was a failure as a man, as a father, as a human being.",
        "Sebastian: Yes, but he shared everything with me. Everything. Who he loved, what he hated, who he had been. And yes, I loved him for the man that he was before he died. He was a great man, a caring man. I loved him for that. And my only hope, my hope was that I could come here and I could share that with you, and maybe, just maybe, finish what he started.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: You know, I don't think there's anything more satisfying than to outlive someone you truly hated.",
        "Phillip: The world can rise again with a full heart. Roger Thorpe is dead.",
        "Alan: (laughs) Well, Ross, what say you, huh?",
        "Ross: I say that my wife has lost her father and could you speak of his death with a little respect for Blake?",
        "Alan: Well, now, we all know that Blake always saw her father through rose- colored glasses.",
        "Phillip: I never had that problem with my father. (laughs) Although I'll tell you, you know, these days, I think I understand Roger a little better. He was consistent. He knew what was important to him and he defended it. There's a monster in all of us.",
        "Alan: Now, wait a minute. You're not suggesting that you're anything like Roger, are you?",
        "Phillip: No. Roger lost. We're very different. I would imagine he ended up a very lonely, broken man and that will not be me.",
        "Ross: I am wasting my time by staying here. You two ghouls have each other.",
        "Alan: Do they know where the funeral will be?",
        "Ross: Uh, no, I don't know. Holly and Blake are still at Towers. They have Roger's ashes with them and all they said is they're going to do something fitting.",
        "Alan: Well, tell me, will this be a private ceremony or can anyone come?",
        "Ross: Alan, do you think in any way you would be welcome?",
        "Alan: Well, I want to pay my respects to Blake, and besides, I haven't seen Holly in quite a while.",
        "Phillip: You know what? That's true. Count me in. You can call for my paperwork on the way.",
        "Ross: Yeah.",
        "Alan: Well, gentlemen, let's make a toast to jolly Roger. May he burn in perdition until we join him, because each of us has something to answer for when the final tally is done. (chuckles)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: You're still here.",
        "Dinah: I'm still here because... It sounds awfully silly, but I'm afraid to move. It's the strangest sensation. I just... It's like someone walking over my grave.",
        "Edmund: And you say I have a flair for the dramatic.",
        "Dinah: It'll pass. I'll be on my way. Aren't you afraid to get this close?",
        "Edmund: I've faced worse.",
        "Dinah: Don't be so sure.",
        "Edmund: You know, you were right, what you said earlier. We do have something in common. We'll both do anything we have to, to protect ourselves and the people we love.",
        "Dinah: Have you ever wondered how far you'd go?",
        "Edmund: Unfortunately, I don't have to wonder.",
        "Dinah: You're not going to make this easy, are you? For me to get close?",
        "Edmund: Close to me? No. No. That's not going to happen. That's completely off the table, so why don't you tell me what you want and I'll respond with what you're likely to get.",
        "Dinah: I'd like to be your friend.",
        "Edmund: I don't think either one of us knows what a friend is. Anything else?",
        "Dinah: That night at the barn, what happened with Jeffrey that will stay our secret. Cassie will never know how close you came to killing him.",
        "Edmund: And why am I supposed to believe that?",
        "Dinah: Well, there's no way I can prove that I won't rat on you, Edmund, but I think we need to trust each other.",
        "Edmund: Yes, I suppose we do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: I want you to promise me that you'll keep the gloating to a minimum. Everybody knows there was no love lost between the Spaulding's and Roger Thorpe. I'm just asking you to behave for the sake of Blake and Holly.",
        "Phillip: A quick chorus of \"Ding-dong, the Witch is Dead.\" It'll be tasteful, though.",
        "Alan: (Laughs)",
        "Ross: And after that, hopefully, there will be a house dropped on the both of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: I didn't notice until now that you have Roger's fire. You have his intensity. It's in the eyes. It's the way he would look at people and he would find things that nobody else could see.",
        "Holly: Oh, no. You said you came here to finish what Roger started. You know, most people in this town would consider that a threat.",
        "Sebastian: It's just a promise I made to my father before he died. He left so many loose ends, so many things undone, unsaid.",
        "Holly: What things are we talking about, Sebastian?",
        "Sebastian: I just want my father to be remembered for who he was, for what he loved.",
        "Holly: What about all the other parts of him? The selfish, sad, lonely, rotten parts of him?",
        "Sebastian: I want to remember the best parts of him. I think you do, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: I'm serious. I want all the snide comments, chuckles, chortles, fake sympathy, all of it, to end. I want you to honor the feelings of Blake and Holly. (elevator groans)",
        "Phillip: What the hell was that?",
        "Alan: We're stopped. Why are we stopping?",
        "Ross: This will teach you to speak ill of the dead.",
        "Alan: You were here, too, Ross. You didn't say anything bad against the man.",
        "Ross: A vengeful ghost wouldn't care, Alan. Hey, I'm joking. All right? We're going to be all right. These elevators have emergency brakes and redundant safety systems. Are you two okay?",
        "Alan: Look, I just don't like confined places, that's all. All right?",
        "Ross: Oh, that's right. You're both claustrophobics.",
        "Phillip: Hit the emergency button.",
        "Ross: Oh, lucky me.",
        "Phillip: Hit the emergency button.",
        "Alan: Hit it.",
        "Ross: I don't hear anything. It must be shorted out.",
        "Phillip: Oh, that's good. Well, if that's not working, what makes you think the safety systems will be?",
        "Alan: We're on the fast train to hell sooner than I thought.",
        "Ross: Uh-huh. Well, if that's the case, say hi to Roger for me, would you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: The road to trust is a long one, and that road, for us, will be the road not taken.",
        "Dinah: I'll hold my breath.",
        "Edmund: Don't. And just so we're clear, stay away from Cassie and stay away from our family. If you do, we'll coexist. If you don't...",
        "Dinah: Hey, listen, like I said, we have to start somewhere. Good luck on your pending nuptials. I'm not so bad once you get to know me. You have nice hands. They're soft and strong.",
        "Edmund: The staying away can begin now.",
        "Dinah: I won't press my luck.",
        "Edmund: Isn't that pretty much all you do?",
        "Dinah: I don't want to let go, Edmund. Not just yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: Michelle Bauer?",
        "Michelle: No, Michelle Santos. Who's this?",
        "Sebastian: A friend of a friend. I am very interested in your lighthouse.",
        "Michelle: I've already got a general contractor. But if you do plumbing or electrical, I'm still taking bids.",
        "Sebastian: Do you have a moment?",
        "Michelle: No. Actually, I'm right in the middle of something.",
        "Sebastian: I'm on my way.",
        "Michelle: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Wait. Wait, Phillip. You should climb through the escape hatch. Get on Ross' back and climb from right here. I'll help you.",
        "Phillip: You get on his back.",
        "Ross: No, no, no, no. No one is getting on my back. Now, both of you need to take a deep... Phillip, you're making me crazy. Stop pushing the buttons. It doesn't work.",
        "Phillip: Well, we've got to do something, Ross. Is it hot in here? I feel like I'm suffocating in here.",
        "Ross: Both of you need to calm down.",
        "Alan: Excuse me while I panic, Ross. I wasn't planning on sharing my coffin with you, all right?",
        "Ross: You need to center yourself and go to a place of peace by thinking of something positive. It will take your mind off your impending death.",
        "Alan: Oh, wow. Thank you.",
        "Phillip: Do you have to say things like that?",
        "Alan: This is so ironic. Here we are, on our way to see Roger off to the great beyond and we're about to join him. Oh, I'm going to wring your neck, Roger, when I see you.",
        "Phillip: Let me tell you something. If Roger can get us out of here right now, I'll kiss him on the mouth. (bell rings) Can I get a glass of water, please?",
        "Blake: Ross, I'm so glad you're here.",
        "Ross: I would have been here a lot sooner except I was stuck in the elevator with two claustrophobics. On top of that, Alan was already cranky because earlier some ashes flew in his eye.",
        "Alan: Well, here you are, Roger. What a hell of a monster you were. You would howl and charge through anything that got in your path. May there never be another one like you.",
        "Clerk: This just came for you, Mr. Spaulding.",
        "Phillip: Oh. Thank you. Ah. Well, you thought this was the end, Harley. Turns out it's just a new beginning.",
        "Blake: He's gone. He's really gone.",
        "Ross: I'm so sorry. For both of you.",
        "Blake: I loved him so much, even when...",
        "Holly: A world without Roger is hard to comprehend. At least he won't hurt anyone again.",
        "Roger: I don't want to do something to you. I just want to be something for you.",
        "Holly: And what would you think of me if I let you be something?",
        "Roger: That it wasn't for nothing, these last 15 years. That we know something now that we didn't know before about kindness and forgiveness. Maybe about love. Angels persist, Holly. Clouds persist. They become showers, they become lakes, they become clouds again, and they persist as we persist.",
        "Sebastian: \"He is not dead. He is just away.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Next, on \"Guiding Light.\"",
        "Sandy: Finding you and being part of your life, I've never been happier. I just don't want anything to come--anyone or anything--to come in between us.",
        "Reva: You're my son. Do you get that?",
        "Tammy: I'm glad I found you.",
        "JB: Yeah, well, I'll be in town a while. And don't worry about Auntie Reva. I'll make sure she never comes between us again."
