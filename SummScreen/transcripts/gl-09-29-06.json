        "Billy: Well, the guy who gave it to you is\r\nnot too shabby, either, and he is still waiting for an answer. ",
        "Reva: I know, I know. I'm still thinking\r\nabout it. I can't give you an answer until I do something. Actually, it's\r\nsomething we have to do. ",

        "Cassie: I'm ready. ",
        "Josh: I didn't say anything. ",
        "Cassie: Because we're not late. Tammy's\r\ncollege journal party doesn't start-- it doesn't matter, we're not late. ",
        "Josh: Cassie, I didn't say anything. ",
        "Cassie: If I'm not tripping over R.J.'s\r\nskateboard, I'm clapping all over the house to find my keys. ",

        "Cassie: See. Yes, yes, this, this is the\r\ngirl you signed up for, Josh. Just warning you. ",

        "Remy: It's awful. It's something I would\r\ngive to you if I were taking you to a prom in 1989. I called the florist in\r\n2006, I swear. ",
        "Tammy: Well... ",
        "Remy: I just got them to say\r\ncongratulations. You can toss them. ",

I know it's last-minute, but I'm thinking it might be a good idea to\r\nspend sometime together to take the weirdness out of this whole situation.\r\nOkay, so call me back. You're not making this any easier on me. ",
        "Billy: You could have given me a heads up. ",
        "Reva: You would have talked me out of it. ",
