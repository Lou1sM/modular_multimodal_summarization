        "Buzz: Well, we've had a good run, old girl. I guess it's time to say good-bye. Sorry I let you down. Thanks for... for...",
        "Harley: Nice, really. Hey, Dad, let me ask you something. Why are all the rest of us going to bother fighting if you're so ready to pack it in?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Thank you.",
        "Phillip: I'll tell you what. I'll buy the next round to celebrate.",
        "Gus: Yeah, what are we celebrating?",
        "Phillip: You're big victory. You got the injunction that saved Company.",
        "Gus: Oh, no, that wasn't really me. That was the nesting warbler. I just... and I promise I was just trying to make sure that Spaulding didn't get in a lawsuit.",
        "Phillip: I believe you. Well, that's good. You succeeded. Barkeep? Two single malts, please.",
        "Gus: Might be a little hasty, you know, because it's just a little reprieve, I think.",
        "Phillip: No, actually it isn't, Gus. I owe you. Getting that injunction gave me some time to think and I realized I... I made the biggest mistake you could make in business. I let this get personal. So it's over, and I'm glad.",
        "Gus: So you're just going back off Company for good?",
        "Phillip: Absolutely. Time to move on.",
        "Gus: Hmm.",

        "Sandy: Oh, awesome. Hate mail. What? I hope you're enjoying masquerading as Reva's son. My mom seems like quite a lady, so accessible, so vulnerable. I don't take kindly to posers.",
        "Reva: Don't you answer your cell phone anymore?",
        "Sandy: Sorry. I turned it off. I was...",
        "Reva: I was trying to call you to tell you about a lead I got on a story. Some guy contacted me, wouldn't give me his name, but wants to set up a meeting for later.",
        "Sandy: And what's the story?",
        "Reva: Corporate scandal. He wouldn't give me the details on the phone, but he wants to meet alone later for an exclusive.",
        "Sandy: And you're going to meet this complete stranger alone?",
        "Reva: Well, yes. Stories like this don't just land in lap ready for broadcast. You have to get in there and you have to dig.",
        "Sandy: Don't go. I have a bad feeling about this one.",
        "Reva: Then it must be a good story.",
        "Sandy: I'm serious, Reva. Don't go. Not this time.",

        "Tammy: JB, Where are you? If he skipped town, I am never going to forgive Aunt Reva.",
        "JB: Don't worry, beautiful, I haven't packed my bags yet.",
        "Tammy: I'm so glad you're here. Glad I found you.",
        "JB: Yeah, well, I'll be in town awhile. And don't worry about auntie I'll make sure she never comes between us again.",

        "Danny: Great. I'll see you then. All right. Thanks. All right.",
        "Michelle: Good news?",
        "Danny: Well, I finally got a job interview at Towers. They called me.",
        "Michelle: That's great.",
        "Danny: Why don't you come with? You can, you know, hang out at the bar and we can catch a drink afterwards.",
        "Michelle: No, I can't. Some guy called. He wants to come over and talk about the lighthouse.",
        "Danny: Why?",
        "Michelle: I don't know. He hung up before I got the chance to find out.",
        "Danny: Well, Michelle, you shouldn't be here alone when he comes over.",
        "Michelle: Good-bye, Danny.",
        "Danny: No. Come on, I'm not being unreasonable. I'll just stick around until we know he's okay.",
        "Michelle: Okay.",
        "Danny: Okay?",

        "Michelle: That's me.",
        "Sebastian: Sebastian Hulce. I can't tell you how good it is to finally meet you. I was close friends with your mother.",

        "Sebastian: Mm-hmm.",
        "Danny: You knew Claire Ramsey?",
        "Sebastian: And you are?",
        "Danny: I'm Danny Santos, Michelle's husband. How well did you know Claire?",
        "Sebastian: I didn't. I knew Maureen Bauer. Actually, you're a lot like her.",
        "Danny: It's interesting that you knew Maureen so well. I never heard of you.",
        "Sebastian: My friendship with Maureen began a few years ago. I moved away and she stayed here and we've always kept in touch. I really regret not seeing her, you know, toward the end. You must miss her terribly.",
        "Danny: Well, I know her family does. Actually, I never met her.",
        "Michelle: And I have a memory thing, you know, from an accident. So if you're here to talk about old times I can't really help you out there, because I don't really remember my mother.",
        "Sebastian: I understand. Actually, I heard about the accident at the warehouse. In fact, that's one of the reasons I'm here. I wanted to see how you were doing.",
        "Michelle: Oh, I'm doing great. It's everybody else who has a problem.",
        "Danny: Michelle says that you're interested in the lighthouse.",
        "Sebastian: Yes, very.",
        "Danny: Why?",
        "Sebastian: Well, it's, you know, it's an historical landmark in this town and I've always dreamed about restoring it and opening it to the public.",
        "Michelle: That's exactly what we're going to do.",
        "Sebastian: Oh, so you're business partners as well as...",
        "Michelle: No, Danny's not my partner. His cousin, Tony Santos is.",
        "Sebastian: I see. Well, you know what? In that case, why don't I come back when the other Mr. Santos is available?",
        "Michelle: Well, you're here now. So why don't you tell me what it is you want to know. And Danny was just leaving anyway.",
        "Sebastian: If you're concerned about leaving your wife here alone with me, I completely understand.",
        "Danny: No, no, no. There are plenty of workmen right outside. Their lunch break is almost over. They'll be up any minute. And I'll be back before you know it, okay?",
        "Michelle: Okay.",
        "Danny: All right.",
        "Sebastian: Well, I look forward to getting to know you better.",
        "Danny: Why? You plan on sticking around?",
        "Sebastian: Yeah, for a while.",
        "Michelle: I'll walk you out. How's that? And I'll be right back.",

        "Tammy: I'm glad I found you.",
        "JB: I wanted you to. How'd you get out of the house without your watchdog?",
        "Tammy: Aunt Reva's just protective. That's all, especially since my mom's away.",
        "JB: Yeah, well, maybe she should protect her own kid, that Sandy guy.",
        "Tammy: Just forget about my family. Can we just spend some time together? Unless you have something else to do.",
        "JB: No. I'll go get us some beers.",
        "Tammy: I'll just have a soda.",
        "JB: All right, whatever you say choirgirl.",
        "Tammy: I'm not used to drinking this early in the day.",
        "JB: From the way that you passed out yesterday, I'd say that you're not used to drinking at all.",
        "Tammy: I was stressed out, okay. That's all it was. And the beers just sort of pushed me over the edge. Are you mad at me?",
        "JB: What, you think I'm not going to like you because you don't drink?",
        "Tammy: I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out what you think, how you feel.",
        "JB: Don't work so hard at it. I thought we had a connection. Maybe I was wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Sandy, meeting strangers, getting stories, that's my job. It's what I do.",
        "Sandy: What if you're walking into a trap?",
        "Reva: What's got you so spooked?",
        "Sandy: The email that we got. You know, the one threatening you?",
        "Reva: I get hate mail all the time; most reporters do. It's part of the job. People like to vent.",
        "Sandy: But what if it's different this time? Huh? I should go with you.",
        "Reva: No. I told him I'd meet him alone. And if I lose his trust, I lose the story. But I do appreciate your concern. And I will have my cell phone turned on. I promise.",
        "Sandy: That won't help you... Reva, if something were to happen to you and I could have prevented it, don't you understand that I would never forgive myself?",
        "Reva: If I let fear direct me in my choices that I make in life, then I would be off the air and out of job.",
        "Sandy: Finding you and being part of your life, I've never been happier. I just don't want anything to come... Anyone or anything to come in between us.",
        "Reva: Sandy. Hey, hey, hey. Your my son, do you get that? That's a bond that can't be broken. It lasts forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: You will hate yourself. You know you will, Dad. If you throw in the towel, you will hate yourself. What Phillip is doing is wrong. And if we let him get away with it, we're saying it's okay.",
        "Buzz: Kiddo, happy endings don't happen because you want them to or because they're right. The Calvary isn't going to come riding in here to save us from the massacre. It's not going to happen. So let's give this gracious lady a good-bye while she's still holding her head high. I don't want to sit on it until she's in rubble. Let's give the old gal a send off she deserves. I'll do water. You do ouzo.",
        "Harley: As long as you know, I've got my fingers crossed behind my back. Make a toast.",
        "Buzz: To Company.",
        "Harley: To Company, original.",
        "Buzz: The last gift from my wife. You kept the family together. You taught me to settle down and embrace the family business.",
        "Harley: You gave us a place to come together again.",
        "Buzz: Imagine that.",
        "Harley: Hmm. (gags)",
        "Buzz: Water?",
        "Harley: Please. (Buzz laughs at Harley)",
        "Buzz: Well, it's all done, but the packing.",
        "Harley: Okay, we may have lost the battle, but we are going to win the war. Right? I'm not going to stand by while Phillip runs rough-shot over us. I won't. What kind of message does that send to my kids? You know, that you could get hit from behind. You just roll over and you wait for the next punch. I can't do that, Dad.",
        "Buzz: So you're going to come out fighting, right?",
        "Harley: Yes.",
        "Buzz: You win, Phil wins. You know it's goes on like that. Where does it end? You're going to raise your kids with a war game like that going on? Is it worth it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: It's all there. That's good. My official notification to the state signed and notarized.",
        "Gus: Let me ask you something.",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm.",
        "Gus: What's making you just all of sudden walk away from Spaulding's hold on the land that's Company's on just like (snaps finger)... Just like that?",
        "Phillip: I told you. It was a mistake. And it's time to move on. Here, by the end of the day Buzz's burger palace will no longer be condemned. Let's drink to it.",
        "Gus: Here's to your change of heart whatever the reason.",
        "Phillip: It had to end. You and damn bird.",
        "Gus: (Laughs)",
        "Phillip: You know it was more than that. All the protest, all the bad PR that we were getting for it.",
        "Gus: Mm-hmm.",
        "Phillip: And Harley started to use it to turn Zach against me. It just had to end.",
        "Gus: Well, you know for whatever it's worth; I think you're doing the right thing.",
        "Phillip: Yeah, I do, too. I'll tell you what. I'm going to let you tell Harley the good news.",
        "Gus: Oh, yeah.",
        "Phillip: You could be the hero.",
        "Gus: Oh, right. A hero. That's what she wants, a Spaulding for a hero.",
        "Phillip: Probably got a point there. Divided loyalties have never worked very well for the Spaulding's anyway, Gus. Oh, you know what? I'm actually meeting somebody.",
        "Gus: Mm-hmm.",
        "Phillip: Can you do me a favor? Can you take care of that for me?",
        "Gus: Yeah, sure. No problem.",
        "Phillip: Great. Thanks.",
        "Gus: Thank you, Phillip, and thank you my little feathered friend.",
        "Phillip: Divided loyalties, Gus. You're either with me or you're not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Wait a minute. What? How much is the roofing material going to cost? Okay. He can't give me a better price then that? I'll wait. Sorry. It's my contractor.",
        "Sebastian: No problem. Take your time. I'm having fun looking around.",
        "Michelle: Yes, I'm here. I'm here. Well that's a lot more then we planned. All right, I'm going to have to run it by Tony. And I'll get back to you. All right. Bye.",
        "Sebastian: Everything all right?",
        "Michelle: Yeah. It's just the price tag on this job just goes up and up... every time we get on the phone.",
        "Sebastian: Well, I'm sure your husband can float you a loan.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, he's not really in the position to do that right now.",
        "Sebastian: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize.",
        "Michelle: No, it's, you know, temporary. He'll be back on top soon.",
        "Sebastian: Hmm. Well, it takes guts to pursue a project like this, you know, especially in light of your husband's financial difficulties.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, well, that's the great part about having no memory, no fear. (both laugh) Anyway, you know, why should I worry? Turn this place into a club and restaurant. It's a money maker anyway you look at it. We'll be turning profit in no time.",
        "Sebastian: Certainly by the end of the second year.",
        "Michelle: No, I think it'll be sooner than that.",
        "Sebastian: I don't know. I've invested in a lot new businesses and that just seems to be the way it is.",
        "Michelle: Well, then I guess I'm going to have to win the lottery in order to put food on these tables.",
        "Sebastian: I have a suggestion. Let me help. I'll buy the place from you--as is--cash.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Zach is caught in the push-pull between you and Phillip. And he's a sharp kid. He knows what's happening and it's hurting him. It's not good for Jude either.",
        "Harley: It's not my intention to turn Zach against his father, Daddy.",
        "Buzz: You've been great to him. And you've been more than fair with Phillip. But this war between the two families goes on; I mean you're going to be able to remain impartial? Loving? What about that temper of yours? I mean, when you kiss a girl with pots and pans flying every time Phillip pulls a number on you?",
        "Harley: No, of course, Dad. But what kind of a mother am I if I just let Phillip run rough shod over us, okay? I need to show my boys that mommy doesn't run away from a fight.",
        "Buzz: Like your old man is doing.",
        "Harley: Okay. Well, it's out there. Here we go.",
        "Buzz: Zach and Jude are lucky to have you as their mother. You're a fighter. I know they're safe with you. You've kept food on the table, a roof over their heads and that's really what's important to kids, isn't it? I mean that's what your brother gave you.",
        "Harley: Yes. Yes, he did. But I can't turn the other cheek when I see cruelty and injustice, Dad, okay. I can't do that, if that's where you're going with this little lecture.",
        "Buzz: Damn it! Lately I have noticed there is some value in maintaining the peace.",
        "Harley: Okay, I'll take that into consideration.",
        "Buzz: I'm going to get some fresh air.",
        "Harley: Good.",
        "Gus: Good. Just the man I wanted to see.",
        "Buzz: This is it? So soon?",
        "Gus: This is it. It's over. You won. Phillip caved.",
        "Buzz: What?",
        "Gus: It's all there in black and white.",
        "Buzz: How did this happen?",
        "Gus: It happened because Phillip can't mess with Mother Nature that's why.",
        "Buzz: My restaurant was saved by a bird?",
        "Gus: Yeah. Actually, you see that tree right there? That tree is in the migratory path of a very rare and endangered bird called the nesting warbler if you could believe that.",
        "Buzz: How could I ever repay you for this?",
        "Gus: Oh, hey, you don't have to thank me. Just call the Springfield Wildlife Society. They're the ones who... They're the ones who made this happen, okay. Them, not me.",

        "Tammy: No, you're not wrong, JB we do have a connection.",
        "JB: We've only known each other for a few days.",

        "JB: Well, I want to feel even closer.",
        "Tammy: Me too.",

        "Sandy: Like who?",
        "Reva: Like Tammy. I was out at the farm earlier and you know, she's out there on her and she was hanging out with this really creepy guy. He was like the anti-Joey.",
        "Sandy: A new guy? Someone you don't know?",
        "Reva: I've never seen him. I don't know what alley she found him in.",
        "Sandy: What's he look like?",
        "Reva: I know he's older than Tammy, tall, dark hair, kind of long, piercing eyes, sullen, and the mouth on this kid.",
        "Sandy: What do you mean by that?",
        "Reva: Well, you know, I can handle teenage rudeness, but this guy had some really dark vibes.",
        "Sandy: Why would Tammy go near a guy like that?",
        "Reva: You know she's been hurting so much since her breakup with Joey. I don't know. I don't know how far it's gone with this creep. But whatever she's doing with him, she's doing it with the wrong guy. (Phone rings) hold on a second, it's Billy.",

        "Sandy: Okay, Tammy, I'm serious now. I need to know where you are and who you're with.",
        "Tammy: You are worse than Aunt Reva. Got to go, bye.",
        "Sandy: Tammy... Tammy. Where are you? Where are you? Okay, it was loud... music... bar music. Music.",
        "Reva: No, I know that, Billy. But Josh is very hard to get a hold of. Yeah, I know. Wait. Hold on a second, wait, my kid's trying to get away from me.",

        "Michelle: Well, first of all, the lighthouse isn't even for sale. And why would you want to buy it? You don't even live here.",
        "Sebastian: Well, that could change. And, besides, this lighthouse has sentimental value for me.",
        "Michelle: Wow. I guess it does.",
        "Sebastian: Is that a yes?",
        "Michelle: You know the lighthouse isn't even going to be worth this much after we're finished the renovations let alone now.",

        "Michelle: No, that's not the problem.",

        "Gus: So get inside, you know, turn on the griddle or chop an onion. Make yourself useful.",
        "Buzz: I think first I'll put out some bird feeders. What do nestling warblers eat?",
        "Gus: Oh, please don't ask me. I don't think they eat much. I hear they're heavy drinkers though. Come on in. I'll make you a drink.",
        "Gus: No, no, it's all right. I... I...",
        "Buzz: Although I know you had nothing to do with this.",

        "Gus: It's for real. We're back in business.",

        "Gus: Well... No actually it's the orn... The ornithological... The bird people, those people and the Environmental Protection Agency. They really put the screws to him, so... that bird, that's a powerful bird in the court.",
        "Harley: And you had nothing to do with this at all?",
        "Gus: Oh, please. When was the last time Phillip ever listened to anything I had to say? I'm happy that Spaulding doesn't have to waste a bunch of money in litigation. That bird, that would've been years in court.",
        "Harley: That's it?",
        "Gus: Yeah. I got to go.",
