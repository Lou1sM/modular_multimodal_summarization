        "Mel tries to push Michelle to stay in town but she insists she is leaving right after the baptism. Edmund goes to the fake farmhouse to bring Dinah food and finds her passed out. He at first accuses her of faking it but when he finds out she is bleeding, tries to bandage her up. Dinah tells Edmund that someone is going to find out his secret and later passes out again after he leaves. Jeffrey tries to tell Cassie about the DNA test they are running on Hope but stops when Reva and Billy show up. Josh can't make it back for the baptism so Jeffrey stands in as Godfather. He gets the DNA tests that prove Cassie isn't the mother, but tells Marina she is and keeps the information to himself. Marina is relieved at the test results. Jeffrey observes blood on Edmund's cuff after the ceremony, which Edmund passes off as a shaving injury. Later at the farmhouse, Jeffrey tells Cassie he needs to tell her something. Sandy asks Cassie's permission to marry Tammy, which she ultimately gives. Tammy witnesses Cassie hugging Sandy and thinks back to Lizzie telling her that Sandy bought a ring.",

Yeah, I know, very official, right? I know I'm on probation. I'm just still trying to think like a cop. Look, I really think that you should try to get to this reception today. I have your gift. No, I know. I know. Okay. Bye. I love you, too. ( Sighs ) Dad, please, try to be there. If this is Michelle and Danny's baby, I'm going to need backup.",

        "Dinah: Uh-huh. Is Michelle invited? Do you think maybe she's going to be there with her... with her baby being baptized? You think maybe she's going to recognize that child? You know there's a connection between a mother and a daughter.",

You have used me for the last time. I'm gonna tell you something. I will get the last laugh. How does that feel? How does that feel? I want you... I want you to feel the pain that you have inflicted on me. I want you to feel that. People say that I'm a bad, bad girl but I've made my mistakes and I know that, but you know what? I have never, ever taken a child away from its mother, and I was going to give that baby to Cassie. As much as I've wanted a baby, I was going to give it, even though I loved her, because I'm not the devil. I am not the devil! You are the devil! You are the devil incarnate.

        "Cassie: Will you stand up there with me? Please? You're going to be a huge part of Hope's life, and it would mean so much to me.",
        "Edmund: Oh, God, Cassie, you can't be serious.",
        "Cassie: Yes. It would mean a lot to me.",
        "Ruthledge: Edmund. You're here. Is... is there a problem?",
        "Cassie: Well, um... well, the Godfather can't show up so we're hoping that we could have a stand-in. Is that all right?",
        "Ruthledge: Why not?",
        "Cassie: ( Laughs ) Okay. Will you do this? Will you do this for me and my little girl?",
        "Jeffrey: Of course.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Lizzie said you bought a ring, Sandy. Are you really going to propose to me?",
        "Sandy: You've been quiet. Anything wrong?",
        "Tammy: No. I saw you with my mom earlier. What was that about?",
        "Sandy: Just wishing her well. It's nice to see her so happy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Hi.",
        "Danny: Hey, what's up? Everything okay?",
        "Marina: Everything's amazing. You're amazing.",
        "Danny: Well, I know, but why are you telling me this now?",
        "Marina: It's just, these things get me all emotional, you know? Life and love and birth and family. How's Robbie?",
        "Danny: Oh, he's fine. He's charming a few more cookies out of Lynn.",
        "Marina: Mm, yeah. Well, I won't keep you. I'll let you go. I should get going myself. I just wanted to call and check in and just say Hi and hear your voice.",
        "Danny: Okay. Call me when you're headed over to the reception.",
        "Marina: Okay. Hope is not your baby, Danny. Everything is going to be okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ruthledge: If you'll all gather around, we'll get started now.",
        "Cassie: I'm so happy.",
        "Ruthledge: Blessed be God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit.",
        "Everyone: And blessed be His kingdom, now and forever. Amen.",
        "Ruthledge: Ordinarily at this point in the service, I'd say a few words, but Cassie has asked to say a few words of her own. Cassie?",
        "Cassie: Thank you. And thank you all for being here today. I feel like I've waited so long for this day and I'm so glad to be able to share it with all of you. Well, today isn't just about this precious, beautiful little girl. It's about all of us. Edmund and I wanted so badly to bring this baby into the world, and, well, she was a tough haul. ( Laughs ) But her story's pretty inspirational when you think about it. You look at her and you see that there is hope, which is why we named her Hope. There is one person who isn't here today, and that's Dinah. Ross, I know that you're missing your little girl, and I just hope that you can take comfort in Hope, knowing that a part of Dinah is here with her. I wanted so badly to thank her, and I just hope wherever Dinah is, that she knows how grateful I am and how grateful Edmund is. And then there is the big sister. And you are going to be a mom one day. And I watch you with your brother and now I see you with Hope and you are just going to be an amazing mother. And I love you.",
        "Tammy: I love you, too.",
        "Cassie: And there's you. I wanted to thank you for coming to our rescue once again now, standing in for Josh. I know that it's only a temporary thing, but I think that you are going to have a powerful love and connection with this little girl, and I think that that love and connection is only going to get stronger. I mean, that's what happens when we have children, right? There's nothing we won't do for them. There's nothing we won't give them if we can. And I guess that's what happens when you love someone. Okay, I'm done. ( Laughs )",
        "Ruthledge: Thank you, Cassie. And now the candidate for Holy Baptism will be presented. Who presents this child for the Sacrament of Baptism?",
        "Reva: I present this child, Hope.",
        "Ruthledge: Uh, Mr. O'Neill? The card?",
        "Jeffrey: Sorry. I present this child, Hope, child of... child of Edmund and Cassie Winslow, to receive the Sacrament of Baptism.",
        "Ruthledge: Will you be responsible for seeing that the child you present is brought up in the faith of our church?",
        "Cassie: I will.",
        "Reva: We will.",
        "Edmund: With Gods help.",
        "Ruthledge: Do you renounce evil and all the spiritual forces of wickedness that rebel against God?",
        "Parents and Godparents: I renounce them.",
        "Ruthledge: Do you renounce the evil powers of this world, which corrupt and destroy?",
        "Parents and Godparents: I renounce them.",
        "Ruthledge: Do you put your whole trust in God's grace and love?",
        "Parents and Godparents: I do.",
        "Ruthledge: Let us now join with Hope in renewing our own baptismal covenant. Could you bring her forward please? Hope? I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.",
        "Reva: She's such a good girl.",
        "Cassie: Don't forget to stop by the farm, everyone. There's plenty of food and drinks, okay?",
        "Blake: Oh, she's so good. What a good girl.",
        "Cassie: She is.",
        "Blake: Oh, you've got a great one on your hands.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, you think so?",
        "Blake: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ross: Cassie, thank you for what you said about Dinah.",
        "Cassie: You don't have to thank me. I meant every word. I really wish she would have stayed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: What have you got up your sleeve?",
        "Sandy: Up my... uh, looks like nothing.",
        "Billy: Come on. You've been smiling like a Cheshire cat ever since Reva picked you up. What's going on?",
        "Sandy: Well, can you keep a secret?",
        "Billy: I've been known to.",
        "Sandy: I'm going to ask Tammy to marry me tonight.",
        "Billy: Is she going to say yes?",
        "Sandy: If I'm lucky.",
        "Billy: You couldn't have picked a better girl. You just treat her good and you'll be set for life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Beautiful service, wasn't it?",
        "Tammy: It was really nice. Too bad Uncle Josh couldn't have been here, though.",
        "Reva: Yeah. Too bad. So what is going on with you? You're awfully quiet this morning.",
        "Tammy: You're the second person who's said that.",
        "Reva: Well, then there must be something to it.",
        "Tammy: Sometimes I'm just quiet. You know that.",
        "Reva: True.",
        "Tammy: I just have a lot on my mind, I guess. That's all.",
        "Reva: Like?",
        "Tammy: Like helping Mom with today. It's a big day for her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Ready to go home?",
        "Michelle: In a minute.",
        "Mel: Well, she seems to be holding up okay.",
        "Rick: No. She's upset. She's very upset.",
        "Mel: I just wish she wasn't rushing off to California tonight.",
        "Rick: Well, the one good thing is that my father will take good care of her.",
        "Mel: I know. I know. But this is a mistake.",
        "Rick: Fine, we both know that, but it's her mistake to make.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: It was a beautiful ceremony, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Thank you.",
        "Michelle: And you, my little sweetheart, you were amazing. She's such a happy baby.",
        "Cassie: You think so?",
        "Michelle: Definitely. I guess, why shouldn't she be, right? I think she's actually starting to look a little bit like you.",
        "Cassie: Yeah?",
        "Michelle: Don't you think so, Jeffrey?",
        "Cassie: ( Laughs )",
        "Jeffrey: That's a little early to tell.",
        "Michelle: Well, I have to go home and pack.",
        "Cassie: Oh. Wow. You're leaving tonight?",
        "Michelle: Yeah. Yes, and I've got to go get Robbie. He's been with Danny. We have a 6:00 flight.",
        "Cassie: Wow. Okay. Um, we're going to miss you. We are. And tell your dad we said \"Hi,\" okay?",
        "Michelle: I will.",
        "Cassie: Good-bye.",
        "Michelle: Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: Michelle looks like she's holding up okay.",
        "Marina: I hope so. She's been through a lot.",
        "Blake: You must be kind of relieved that she's going out of town.",
        "Marina: Blake.",
        "Blake: Well, it's uncomfortable bumping into the exes. Ask Ross. But you don't have anything to worry about.",
        "Marina: I know. I'm not worried.",
        "Blake: I've seen the way Danny looks at you. He loves you. That's not going to change.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Jeffrey. Thank you. Cassie and I both appreciate you standing in.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, I didn't want her to feel disappointed. You would know all about that feeling, wouldn't you?",
        "Edmund: Excuse me.",
        "Jeffrey: Is that blood?",
        "Edmund: I cut myself shaving. I should probably change for the reception.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, it's not that big a deal.",
        "Edmund: Well, just the same, I wouldn't want people to think I'm a careless dresser.",
        "Jeffrey: ( Laughs ) Well... yeah, well, you're in good shape if that's your biggest sin. But then again, who are we kidding?",
        "Edmund: Excuse me.",
        "Marina: I have never been more relieved to be wrong. If Edmund had...",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, that would have turned everything upside down.",
        "Marina: For all of us.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: She's just perfect, isn't she?",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie.",

        "Cop: Ms. Santos, we have your baby.",
        "Cassie: Michelle?",
        "Michelle: My baby. My baby!",
        "Cassie: No, that's my baby. It's my baby. Jeffrey, would you tell... Cassie. Hey. Is everything all right?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, it's fine. What's up?",
        "Cassie: Well, we should probably get going.",
        "Jeffrey: So soon?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. We've got to get ready for the party. Can you give us a lift?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, sure.",

        "R.J.: You think Mom will let me have two pieces of cake?",
        "Reva: You know what? I don't know about that. What do you think, Uncle Billy?",
        "Billy: If she doesn't, I'll slip you one, okay?",
        "Reva: You can always count on your Uncle Billy.",

        "Michelle: Are you guys sure you don't want to go to the party?",
        "Mel: Well, we hadn't planned on it, and I'm on call later...",
        "Rick: And as much as I like to have a good meal, fatherhood definitely comes first, so I'd be more than happy to watch Robbie if Danny wants to come out.",
        "Michelle: You're sure?",
        "Rick: Yeah, absolutely.",
        "Michelle: Thanks.",
        "Mel: All right. See you.",
        "Michelle: I know it's pointless, but I can't help thinking about what might have been.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Edmund. I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. I know that I've been snooping around and sticking my nose where it really doesn't belong, and I wanted to tell you, you have a beautiful baby. She's just beautiful. So congratulations.",
        "Edmund: Thank you.",
        "Ross: So, Edmund, will we see you at the reception?",
        "Edmund: Uh, yes. I was going to head over there as soon as I find Cassie, but... where is she?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Okay. Come on, Sweetie. Hey, can you get the extra leaf for the table out of the closet? It's right in there.",
        "Jeffrey: You know what? I think... I think that can wait.",
        "Cassie: Oh. Oh, I know. You want a proper thank you, right? For everything you did to help me today? Thank you. Wasn't the reverend amazing? He did such a great job, and he has always been so nice to me and Tammy when we come into town. So nice.",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie. Cassie.",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Jeffrey: There's something that you need to know.",
