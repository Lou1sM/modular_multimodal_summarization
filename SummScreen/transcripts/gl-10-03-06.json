        "Mel: Me.",
        "Rick: Well that's a surprise. I thought you were working days so our shifts wouldn't overlap.",
        "Mel: Something came up with Perkins, so I'm covering the first part of his shift. We haven't worked together in a while, have we?",
        "Rick: You okay with that?",
        "Mel: Yeah.",
        "Rick: It's a quiet night.",
        "Mel: Actually, some guy came in with an ingrown toenail; it was touch and go for a while.",
        "Rick: (Laughs) That's good, honey. That's good. What have you got?",
        "EMT: On the freeway, a six car pileup. This guy's only the first.",

        "Remy: Excuse me, young lady, aren't you put past your curfew?",
        "Leah: I'm not worried, I have connections. My favorite uncle is a Springfield cop.",
        "Remy: (Laughs) Well good luck with that one. I heard he's one of those by the books cops. Speaking of books, what have you got?",
        "Leah: English literature, \"Great Expectations.\"",
        "Remy: So what, you're studying in the middle of town?",
        "Leah: I can't study at home. It is too quiet.",
        "Remy: Your mom and dad are still having a rough time?",
        "Leah: What if they break up? Then I'll be stuck taking care of my dad.",
        "Remy: He's a big boy, Leah.",
        "Leah: Big, but clueless. He needs guidance. I hate this. I came home because I missed the way things used to be. It seems like everybody in this town has gone crazy.",

        "Gus: Honey.",
        "Harley: Hmm?",
        "Gus: I thought I was the addict?",
        "Harley: I'm not addicted. I've been playing for like ten minutes.",
        "Gus: Oh, no. You've been sitting here for over an hour.",
        "Harley: Really?",
        "Gus: Really.",
        "Gus: Don't you have a job to do or something?",
        "Harley: Well, I'm thinking our web master is probably a gambler, too, so this is my way of trying to get into his criminal mind.",
        "Gus: That is the worst piece of deductive reasoning I've heard in a very long time.",
        "Harley: Fine. Well while I come up with something better, could you spot me a 20?",

        "Reva: You don't need to make all that fuss, Billy.",
        "Billy: Oh, come on. Fussing over you is what I do best. Now, I've got the minister, I've got the chapel, I've got the rings, florist-- flowers",
        "Reva: I don't need flowers.",
        "Billy: Oh-- hey, every bride needs flowers. I'll see you very shortly.",
        "Reva: Don't look at me like that. Billy loves me to death. I know, literally. He makes me laugh. And he's my rock, and I know I can lean on him. Even when I know that I should probably be going it alone. The truth is, Joshua, the thing about being sick and staring down death, it's not so much the sadness as it is the fear. You know, will the pain be too much. Will I die alone? Will I be afraid? I don't have to worry about that now, because Billy will be there. And I do love him. Maybe not the way that we loved each other. I mean, I know that, and Billy knows it, too. But it is still love, all the same. So you go back to Cassie, Joshua. Because I'm going to marry the greatest guy I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Are you sure about this? Are you absolutely sure? Because once we... there's no turning back.",
        "Josh: I don't want to turn back, Cassie. I have no doubts about this whatsoever. I am exactly where I want to be.",

        "Gus: Do you know how casinos make all that money, babe? It is not the glamorous games like craps or roulette or poker. No. You want to know how they make that money?",
        "Harley: Bingo?",
        "Gus: Slot machines. This is a computer. You're just playing a computer. It's a random number generated that's... you get one out of $250 million, you're lucky.",
        "Harley: Uh-huh.",
        "Gus: I can't believe that you like gambling this much.",
        "Harley: Oh, my gosh. Oh, my God! I can't believe, I won. I won $25.",

        "Harley: Uh-huh.",
        "Gus: I sure hope this isn't how you ran Spaulding Enterprises?",
        "Harley: This is exactly how I ran Spaulding Enterprises. Let me tell you, the stocks were up when I was there. They would have gone even higher, too. And that was real money. This is just quarters.",
        "Gus: Baby, do you know how many quarters you've lost?",
        "Harley: I don't know, 50?",
        "Gus: Listen, come here. Come here, come here. Just for a second. Four times $270. Four times $270.",
        "Harley: How much is that?",
        "Gus: I don't know. Its a lot. Baby, come on.",
        "Harley: What are you doing?",
        "Gus: A little intervention, okay?",
        "Harley: Put me down. I'm not 12.",
        "Gus: You're not 12, because a 12-year-old would be bored with that game and onto something else.",
        "Harley: Honey, I'm just trying to win back some money for you.",
        "Billy: Do I have to call in security.",
        "Harley: Hi, Billy.",
        "Gus: What are you doing here?",
        "Billy: Well, I was going to ask you the same thing.",

        "Billy: Oh, well, I'm here getting married.",
        "Gus: I didn't even know you were dating anybody, really?",
        "Reva: I wouldn't exactly call it dating.",

        "Reva: Oh.",
        "Gus: And you're here to get hitched.",
        "Billy: You can't get anything by these detectives these days, huh?",
        "Reva: Yeah, we're here to get hitched.",
        "Gus: To each other?",
        "Billy: That's the way it's done.",
        "Gus: How did that happen?",
        "Reva: Billy and I make each other happy.",
        "Billy: And we've been down this road before, haven't we?",
        "Harley: So, where is the ceremony? Is anybody else flying in for this event?",
        "Reva: No. As a matter of fact, we could use a couple of witnesses, too. I mean, eloping is fun, but it would be fun to have some home folk.",
        "Harley: You want us?",
        "Billy: We'd love to have you.",
        "Gus: Baby, the slot machine will be here when we get back. It's okay. Nope, guys, it would be an honor, really.",

        "Mel: This is nice. We should do more of this.",
        "Rick: What, touching each other's hands inside somebody's abdomen.",
        "Mel: No. I just mean, sitting here taking a break together.",
        "Rick: Yeah, well, I certainly haven't made things easy.",
        "Mel: Neither have I.",
        "Rick: Life just seems so complicated. And with my work and your work and us driving Leah around everywhere and all these mistakes that I've made.",
        "Mel: Maybe it's time to just let go of some of those things.",
        "Rick: Honey, you don't know how long I've waited to hear you say that.",
        "Mel: Me, too.",
        "Rick: I just want you to know something. I have never... I have never stopped loving you. I have never stopped wanting our marriage to heal. I love you. I miss you.",
        "Leah: Go, Dad.",
        "Remy: Easy, girl.",
        "Leah: Look, she is happy. My mom's happy.",

        "Rick: Thank you, Melissande.",
        "Alan: So this is the payback I get for all of the charitable donations that I have made to the hospital. Doctors playing hooky when I need them most.",
        "Rick: Are you hurt, Alan, sick or something?",
        "Alan: No.",
        "Rick: Then what can I do for you?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: After waiting for this for so long, it is still even better than I dreamed. It just feels so right with you. I knew it would. I knew it would feel right. Josh?",
        "Josh: (Snoring)",
        "Cassie: Are you asleep? (Laughs) Oh, stop.",
        "Josh: What? I'm sorry, are you still talking?",
        "Cassie: Yes, I'm talking.",
        "Josh: Oh, okay. (Both laugh) I'm kidding. I heard every word. Every word, I promise.",
        "Cassie: You don't think we did this too soon, do you?",
        "Josh: After what you just did to me, I can't figure out why I didn't get you naked sooner.",
        "Cassie: I'm serious.",
        "Josh: (Laughs) Cassie, everything I want in life for the rest of my life I'm holding in my arms right now.",

        "Billy: Yes, I am.",
        "Gus: She is quite a lady.",
        "Billy: She's the best.",
        "Gus: That kind of makes me your best man when you think about it, because I'm sure your brother Josh isn't so keen on showing up.",
        "Billy: Gus, are you going somewhere with this conversation?",
        "Gus: No. I'm just saying that I probably have responsibilities, so anything I can...",
        "Billy: You mean like showing up and being pretty.",
        "Gus: No. I mean, you know, if there is a theme. You know, is it like tacky and fun, you know, Vegas-Y.",
        "Billy: Fun aside, I don't want this to be a joke. I want Reva to have something to remember here. I mean, she is a really good woman. She deserves it.",
        "Gus: Wow!",
        "Billy: What do you mean \"Wow?\"",
        "Gus: You've got it bad.",
        "Billy: Don't most grooms have it bad?",
        "Gus: Yeah, I guess, but...",
        "Billy: You got a little problem with me and Reva, huh?",
        "Gus: No, no. I'm just saying you have to be careful with people who have a history with somebody else. For me it's Mallet and Harley. For you it's Josh and Reva.",
        "Billy: No, no. For me it's Josh and Reva, but things are over.",
        "Gus: Good. Because bubble up, is all I'm saying, you know, things come out of nowhere...",
        "Billy: You gotta understand that...",
        "Gus: What is that?",
        "Billy: We've been there before. Look, she got me sober. She is my savior. She never judged me, she never punished me, she never abandoned me. And I flat out love her. Now you can either get on this ship or abandon...",
        "Gus: No, no. Enough said. I'm with you, all of the way.",
        "Billy: Because this is about one of the best things I've done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Okay. (Laughs) What do you think?",
        "Harley: You look great.",
        "Reva: I don't know, do you think the earrings are too flashy, too much?",
        "Harley: Reva, in that dress I don't think anybody is going to be looking at your earrings, least of all, Billy.",
        "Reva: (Laughs) Yeah. Well, I'm glad you're here. I really am glad you're here.",
        "Harley: Okay.",
        "Reva: We didn't want to make a big spectacle out of this, but it is nice to have reminders of home.",
        "Harley: Well, I'm honored. And Billy, I have never seen him like this. He's beaming.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, you have no idea how wonderful he has been to me. I don't even think he knows for sure.",
        "Harley: Well, I hope he does. You're marrying the guy.",
        "Reva: Yeah, yeah. I am.",
        "Harley: Well, let's get you to the chapel on time, right?",
        "Reva: Anything we're forgetting...",
        "Harley: Well, I assume we don't need to talk about the birds and the bees.",
        "Reva: That's my favorite part. I love the talk about the birds and the bees.",
        "Harley: Come on, are you ready?",
        "Reva: I'm ready. I can't wait to marry Joshua.",

        "Beth Ehlers, \"Inside The Light.\" I think my kids are cool. They're funny, they're smart, they have great personalities. I like watching them grow into people. I love to travel. That's my thing. If I didn't have children, I would be on the road. I'm a gypsy. See Harley, Wednesday, October 4, \"Inside The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: So is Beth okay? Is she in some sort of trouble?",
        "Alan: Why don't you tell me, Rick. You know, I've been away for a while, but that doesn't mean I haven't been monitoring the situation.",
        "Rick: Situation?",
        "Alan: Yes. Have you been with Beth recently?",
        "Rick: She's your wife. Alan, why would you ask me that question?",
        "Alan: I would be a fool to ignore what you and Beth have. After all, Rick, you are one of her oldest friends.",
        "Rick: I haven't seen much of Beth lately, so I really can't help...",
        "Mel: But you went to the house a couple of times when James was sick, right?",
        "Rick: A couple of times. It was house calls for James. He was sick, that's it.",
        "Alan: How did Beth seem?",
        "Rick: I don't know. Fine, I guess.",
        "Alan: Did she talk to you about Elizabeth and the baby?",
        "Rick: No, I don't remember...",
        "Mel: You went to lunch with Beth and Lizzie, right?",
        "Rick: Look, this is none of my business. As far as Lizzie and Beth are concerned, I just don't want to have anything to do with this.",
        "Mel: Alan, why don't you stay out of it, too. Let Lizzie enjoy her life for once.",
        "Alan: I should have known I wouldn't get any help with you two.",
        "Mel: (Scoffs) That is some marriage, huh? It makes us look like...",
        "Rick: Us. It makes it look like us a couple of years ago, actually.",
        "Mel: Yeah.",
        "Rick: Hey, hey. You're off for the rest of the day. I have 30 minutes left, 30 precious minutes. What do you say we get something to drink? Okay? Just like the old times. I'll get me a cup of coffee, and you'll have a nice tall glass of chardonnay.",
        "Mel: Shiraz.",
        "Rick: Shiraz, chardonnay. Same thing. What do you think. I don't want to push you into this.",

        "R.J.: I was, but everybody got scared by the storm so they all went home.",
        "Cassie: Okay, that's okay.",
        "R.J.: I bet you never got scared by a storm, Uncle Josh?",
        "Josh: Me? What, are you kidding? I got a story to tell you, but first you know what the best thing is for a storm, huh? Cookies and milk. Milk and cookies, the best thing for a storm, R.J.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Listen, we could go about this a few ways. We can pretend I just didn't hear you, although we both know that I did. Or we can talk about why you said Josh's name instead of Billy's. Or we could agree that we both know why you said Josh's name.",
        "Reva: I don't agree to anything.",
        "Harley: You still have feelings for Josh. I'm not saying that you shouldn't have feelings for Josh. I mean, of course you should. You were married to him forever. You have children with him.",

        "Harley: You sure?",
        "Reva: He is happy with Cassie, and that's what I want for him.",
        "Harley: Why are you talking about him on your wedding day?",
        "Reva: Because it is my wedding day. (Laughs) I mean, come on, you want to talk about reality, is that I never thought I would ever have another wedding day. At least I never thought I would ever have another wedding day without him. But, you know, I thought I would spend the rest of my life with him, but things change. And today is not about looking back. It is about looking forward to everything that I have with Billy, which is a whole hell of a lot.",
        "Harley: Okay. Well, I know it is. Here. You look great.",
        "Reva: Thank you.",

        "Billy: No. That's Josh and Reva.",
        "Gus: Ooh, no, you don't want that. How about the classic blood red? Two pumping hearts joined together forever in eternity.",
        "Billy: Where did you hear that from?",
        "Gus: It says it on the card. Come on, you're not going to be difficult, are you?",
        "Billy: No, no. Look, I just want everything to be perfect, just to be-- never mind. That's perfect. (Laughter)",

        "Rick: This feels like when we first started dating. Watch this, I'm going to be a gentleman.",
        "Mel: I was just thinking about that. We used to go out for drinks after our shift ended. That was so fun.",
        "Rick: So why is it I feel just as nervous right now as when we first started dating? Why is that?",
        "Mel: Oh, honey. It's just good.",

        "Rick: Yes. Those little notes used to embarrass you.",

        "Rick: Why don't I do it? You don't remember that?",

        "Rick: I prescribed to some patient, \"My undying love, can't wait to see you. Love, Rick Bauer.\" You can't remember that?",
        "Mel: I do, I remember that. Oh, gosh. We have to thank God every day we are with each other because to seeing Alan...",
        "Rick: I know. He is the grim reaper. He should have a bell around his neck to warn people that he's coming.",
        "Mel: Absolutely. Yes. On our worst day, we're not like Alan and Beth. I mean, that is a toxic marriage. Other than Phillip, I thought Beth would end up with someone... with someone more like you.",
        "Rick: I'm taken. (Cell phone rings) It's the phone. It's the hospital. I've got to take it.",
