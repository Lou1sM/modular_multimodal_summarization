        "Edmund: Lorelei? If this is her idea of a joke. Lorelei! \r\n",
        "Lorelei: Be right out! \r\n",
        "Edmund: Thank you. I bought you some clothes. All the designers Beth\r\nused to wear. Classic, sophisticated. I know you said you wanted to approach \r\nher from the inside out, surely dressing like her can't hurt. \r\n",
        "Lorelei: I'm way ahead of you, Eddie. \r\n",
        "(Humming \"Wedding March\") \r\n",
        "Lorelei: Well, however that song goes. Not bad, huh? ",

        "Richard: All right, Father Sullivan's on his way. \r\n",
        "Cassie: Okay. \r\n",
        "Richard: Found you. \r\n",
        "Cassie: Yes. You wore this. \r\n",
        "Richard: Yes, I did. \r\n",
        "Cassie: For your christening. \r\n",
        "Richard: And my father and his father before him. \r\n",
        "Cassie: And now our son is going to wear it, too. \r\n",
        "Richard: You know, I do apologize that we have to have the ceremony \r\nhere. \r\n",
        "Cassie: Oh, no. It's not your fault the earthquake destroyed the \r\nchapel. It's \r\nokay. \r\n",
        "Richard: But you know, if you wanted to hold off, you know, if you \r\nwanted something more formal as an occasion. \r\n",
        "Cassie: No, no, no. I want to keep this small and simple. I don't want \r\nthe \r\nmedia asking us a whole bunch of questions. I just want to... I want to savor\r\n\r\nthe moment, and I want to celebrate the arrival of our little boy. \r\n",
        "Richard: That's exactly how I feel. I'm thinking we can have another\r\n\r\nceremony for your family and anyone else who wants to attend later. \r\n",
        "Cassie: Okay. Thank you. \r\n",
        "Richard: For what? \r\n",
        "Cassie: For guiding me to this point and helping me see that this was \r\nthe \r\nright thing to do. I mean, I was so opposed to adoption and now I am... I am \r\nso happy that we are. ",
        "",
        "Dax: Have my driver bring the car around front, I'll be out in a \r\nmoment. \r\n",
        "Mrs. Mayhew: You're leaving? But the christening is just about... \r\n",
        "Dax: There may not be a christening if I can get to Alonzo in time. \r\n",
        "Mrs. Mayhew: Colonel, wait. If you talk to Alonzo, what will you say to\r\n\r\nhim? \r\n",
        "Dax: Whatever I have to. The monarchy comes first, Mrs. Mayhew. To \r\nrestore it, to preserve it. \r\n",
        "Mrs. Mayhew: Ye c colonel, I agree. But Cassie and Richard have already\r\n\r\nlost one child. Finally they are happy again. Once you tell Alonzo about this\r\n\r\nbaby... \r\n",
        "Dax: I don't like it any more than you do, dear lady. The last thing I \r\nwant \r\nis to hurt Richard and Cassie, but we have no choice. \r\n",
        "Blake: So I showed up at Ross's class to surprise him and there he was,\r\n\r\nwith his arms around a female student. ",
        "",
        "Holly: Giving her the Heimlich maneuver? \r\n",
        "Blake: No, he was comforting her. She was upset. \r\n",
        "Holly: All right. \r\n",
        "Blake: It is all right. I know her-- Tory granger-- and she's a very \r\nearnest, \r\nbright young woman and Ross believes she has the makings of an amazing \r\nlawyer. That's why he was upset. \r\n",
        "Holly: Why? \r\n",
        "Blake: Well, because she has money problems and she can't make her \r\ntuition, so when I heard about her predicament, I thought that I could help...\r\n\r\nWhat? \r\n",
        "Holly: You're not jealous? \r\n",
        "Blake: (Scoffs) oh, please, mother. I am so far above being jealous \r\nnow. \r\nI mean, really. The only thing that I thought of when I saw Ross and this girl\r\n\r\ntogether was... All right, I'd kill her. I'll tear her from limb to limb and \r\nthen \r\nI'm going to kill him, too. \r\n",
        "Buzz: Yikes. I hope this violent streak came from your father's side.\r\n\r\n",
        "Holly: Don't count on it. Thank goodness for that reaction. For a \r\nsecond \r\nthere, I thought you'd become superhuman. \r\n",
        "Blake: (Clears throat) it was an involuntary whim lasting but a mere\r\n\r\nmillisecond, and then I reverted to my calm, rational self again. \r\n",
        "Holly: I think it was a perfect reaction. \r\n",
        "Blake: Oh, listen, it turns out that Tory's problem becomes my \r\nsolution. At \r\nmy suggestion, Ross is hiring her as his legal assistant. Now she can afford to\r\n\r\npay her tuition and Ross doesn't spend so many hours at the office and he \r\nspends more time with me. \r\n",
        "Holly: I am impressed. You truly have evolved. \r\n",
        "Blake: Think so. \r\n",
        "Buzz: What, did you rob a library? \r\n",
        "Reva: Actually, I was hoping to find some little corner I can hide away \r\nin. \r\n(Laughs) oh, right here. This is great. \r\n",
        "Buzz: I'll bring you some coffee. I think you're going to have to stay\r\n\r\nawake for a while. \r\n",
        "Holly: Thanks Buzz. \r\n",
        "Reva: Okay, so I took your suggestion and I went and got all these \r\nreference books on American art history and the civil war. \r\nBut there's not a single thing in any of these that even closely resembles my\r\n\r\ncanvas, or Madame X. \r\n",
        "Blake: Madame who? \r\n",
        "Holly: She bought a painting, a portrait. \r\n",
        "Blake: Of a woman? \r\n",
        "Reva: Yes. But not just any woman. It's a portrait of Olivia, over a \r\ncentury \r\nago. ",
        "",
        "Alan: Well, Olivia, your timing could not be more perfect. I was just\r\n\r\nupdating Josh on our relationship. ",
        "",
        "Olivia: Look, Josh, I don't know what he told you, but... \r\n",
        "Josh: Actually, he told me that you've secured new financing for the \r\nharbor \r\nproject-- a group of private investors. \r\n",
        "Olivia: Right. Yeah. \r\n",
        "Josh: Well, I think that's great. I just wish you'd told me first. \r\n",
        "Olivia: I'm... I'm s --",
        "Josh: But it's okay, I forgive you. Especially since Alan is our major\r\n\r\ninvestor. \r\n",
        "Alan: Was your major. I am now just a minor player. \r\n",
        "(Cell phone rings) \r\n",
        "Josh: Excuse me. Excuse me. \r\n",
        "Olivia: Okay. \r\n",
        "Josh: Yes, Josh Lewis. Did you not get my message? \r\n",
        "Alan: You look a little uncomfortable. \r\n",
        "Olivia: What would you have said to him if I hadn't shown up when I \r\ndid? \r\n",
        "Alan: Why do you ask that? Do you think I have something besides \r\nbusiness to discuss with Josh? \r\n",
        "Olivia: No, you don't have anything else to discuss with him, but since\r\n\r\nyou've lost your hold over me, you might be feeling a bit vindictive and want\r\n\r\nto retaliate, Alan, and that would be very, very foolish. \r\n",
        "Alan: Foolish would be you not returning to my bed, because I know you\r\n\r\nwant it as much as I do. \r\n",
        "Josh: What is it you want?",
        "",
        "Alan: Olivia wants what I want-- what we all want: The harbor project \r\nto \r\nbe a big success where we can make a lot of money. \r\n",
        "Josh: Well, that sounds good to me. \r\n",
        "Alan: Yes. So she has secured the future of the project by finding \r\nadditional capital. So instead of ruling the roost, I will just be another \r\nrooster \r\nin the pen. I feel a little displaced, but I know it's good business. \r\n",
        "Josh: Well, Alan, you'll get the same return on your money no matter \r\nhow \r\nmany roosters there are in the pen, right? \r\n",
        "Alan: Well, actually I've already started reaping some of the rewards. \r\nYou \r\nhave a very talented wife. \r\n",
        "Josh: Yes, I know that. \r\n",
        "Alan: She's enthusiastic, very driven and has a gift... \r\n",
        "Olivia: Hey, you know what? I appreciate this, but I don't feel \r\ncomfortable \r\nwith all the flattery. \r\n",
        "Alan: I like to give praise where praise is due, but I do have another\r\n\r\nappointment, so if you two will excuse me, I will be off. \r\n",
        "Josh: Is there something you want to tell me? \r\n",
        "Olivia: Such as? \r\n",
        "Josh: Well, such as why it is you felt you had to make an end run \r\naround \r\nAlan Spaulding? \r\n",
        "Olivia: Oh, I... \r\n",
        "Josh: You know what? That's okay, though. I don't care. I think it's \r\none \r\nof the best things you've ever done. ",
        "",
        "Reva: I don't want to be drawn to Olivia. I don't want to have anything \r\nto \r\ndo with Olivia, but every time I try to escape her, I can't. \r\n",
        "Blake: Well, maybe it's yourself you're trying to escape. \r\n",
        "Reva: Sorry? \r\n",
        "Blake: Do you believe in past lives? The theory that we've been born \r\nand \r\ndied over and over again? \r\n",
        "Reva: You mean karma? The life cycle kind of thing? \r\n",
        "Holly: You mean something more specific. \r\n",
        "Reva: Hey, I believe in a lot of psychic phenomena, but past lives? \r\nThat's \r\na little too farfetched. \r\n",
        "Blake: No, the theory behind past lives is the life we led before \r\nshapes the \r\nlife we're leading today. \r\n",
        "Reva: The past isn't dead, it isn't even past. \r\n",
        "Blake: The circle of friends never really changes around you until you\r\n\r\nwork out whatever karma you're supposed to work out with them. Now, for \r\ninstance, let's say you had a former life with Olivia? You could go back to that\r\n\r\nlife... \r\n",
        "Reva: Through hypnosis? \r\n",
        "Blake: Yes. And you could explore your relationship with her then and\r\n\r\nmaybe gain insight to help you today. \r\n",
        "Reva: Okay. I'm game. \r\n",
        "Holly: Uh, uh, uh. \r\n",
        "Reva: I am. I'll try anything once. I will. So, where do I go to get\r\n\r\nhypnotized? \r\n",
        "Blake: Well, you could try it with me. You could start... I actually \r\ndid \r\nsome research on this for a book idea at one point, and I sat in some sessions,\r\n\r\nand I know what to do. \r\n",
        "Reva: Great! Let's do it. Only let's not do it here. Let's go back to \r\nmy \r\nplace. Let's go. \r\n",
        "Holly: I'll go with you. As a journalist, I won't say a word. \r\n",
        "Blake: Okay. You keep your mind open and your mouth shut. \r\n",

        "Danny: Yeah. Well, I pretty much figured out who the so-called mob big\r\n\r\nshot is, who Carlos claims is behind the Spaulding scheme. \r\n",

        "Michelle: You. You. Of course. \r\n",
        "Danny: The only problem is, they don't have a case against me, so she's\r\n\r\ntrying to give them one, and the Spaulding heist would be a perfect setup. If I\r\n\r\nwere to go through with it and get caught, they could nail me. \r\n",
        "Michelle: That disgusting... \r\n",
        "Danny: Yeah, right. Yeah. I mean, no big surprise that she would send\r\n\r\nme to prison, but would she go so far as to kill me if I refuse the job? Who \r\nknows? So, I'm calling her bluff. I told Carlos to forget about it. I'm not \r\ngoing to do it. \r\n",

You know, there's half a dozen sites devoted \r\nto \r\nyou and your prissy Princess, and they got loads of pictures of your wedding.\r\n\r\nThere's even a site where you can buy a knock-off of her dress, so I did. I \r\nmean, you said that if I dress like her, maybe it'd help me act like her. So, \r\nhow \r\nam I doing so far? \r\n",
        "Edmund: It's... Oh. It's uncanny. \r\n",
        "Lorelei: Well, it gets better. One of them sites had a video of you \r\nguys \r\nsaying your vows, so I played it over and over again, so I could get the sound\r\n\r\nof her voice. You ready? \r\n",

There are a lot of good, decent people out there that \r\nhave \r\nbeen waiting years to adopt a baby, and it just feels like we jumped right in\r\n\r\nfront of them, and we did it private... In private, because of who we are. Not\r\n\r\nto mention the fact that, you know, we took the mother's word for it that the\r\n\r\nfather had no interest whatsoever in this baby, and then, you know, the judge\r\n\r\njust signed off on the papers and everything just went through. \r\n",
