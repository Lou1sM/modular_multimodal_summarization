        "Blake: Do you think my father suffered? Do you think he was scared at the end?",
        "Ross: Well, knowing Roger as I did, for as long as I did, I don't think he was afraid of anything. Not even death, I would imagine.",
        "Blake: I would like to think so.",
        "Ross: Honey, you remember the Pine Grove bed and breakfast that we stayed at. Why don't we go back there? We can relax, walk the grounds, have a little quiet time.",
        "Blake: I appreciate the thought, Ross, but there are some things I need to settle with Sebastian, first.",
        "Ross: I wish that young man would go back to wherever he came from.",
        "Blake: Sebastian is my brother.",
        "Ross: Yes. But he came here to serve Roger Thorpe. That's never a good thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: Hello, Holly.",
        "Holly: Sebastian. What are you doing here?",
        "Sebastian: I thought I should be here to keep you company. You know. It's not everyday someone runs a DNA test on me behind my back. Let's see how it turns out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Hey, there, Beth.",
        "Beth: Hey.",
        "Bill: You must be very proud of Phillip, huh? Company is saved. Harley's homeless, though.",
        "Beth: What can I say? The man has gone thoroughly around the bend.",
        "Bill: Yeah. Yeah, he sure has. Look, can I ask you something? I mean you are a good person. And where I was concerned, you know, you had pretty good taste in men.",
        "Beth: You weren't bad. (Laughs)",
        "Bill: Harley has a head on her shoulders, she's smart, she's funny, she's caring. Olivia, she's a beautiful woman with so much going for her.",
        "Beth: Okay. I see where this is going.",
        "Bill: What the heck do you see in this guy? I mean, is it the money? Is it the cloved feet? Is it the little horns that jut out from his head? Tell me, it's got to be the money. Is that what it is?",
        "Beth: He wasn't always like this.",
        "Bill: Yeah, please.",
        "Beth: No.",
        "Bill: Yeah, okay, whatever.",
        "Beth: Hey, listen. Once before you asked if I'd help you take Phillip down a peg or two.",
        "Bill: Yes. And you said no and pledged your undying loyalty to Phillip before you scurried on off.",
        "Beth: Yes. Well, that was then, and this is now. Where do I sign up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: All right. You said you did a bad thing. What was it? Honey, there is nothing that you could have done that would make me love you less. Let me help you.",
        "Lizzie: Daddy, I took your car and I... I think I might have hit something.",
        "Phillip: Like another car? Or an animal?",
        "Lizzie: A person.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "JB: You deserve this, you know. It's what you get for stealing my life. You hear me, Sandy? It's my turn to do whatever I want and mommy dearest can't do anything about it.",
        "Tammy: Aunt Reva, do you want me to get you some coffee? You look really tired.",
        "Reva: No, honey, I'm fine, really. All I want is that Sandy pulls through this. I'm going to go in now, too, because I want my face to be the first one he sees when he wakes up.",
        "JB: Eeny, meeny, miney, mo.",
        "Tammy: Hey. I'm going to get you some coffee anyway, okay?",
        "Reva: Okay, sweetie.",
        "Nurse: Mrs. Lewis.",
        "Nurse: Mrs. Lewis.",
        "Nurse: Mrs. Lewis. There's one other form I need you to sign.",
        "Reva: Oh, sure.",
        "JB: Can you hear me in there, Sandy? No one is going to come and save you, just like no one came and saved me. Remember? Sandy!",
        "Sandy: Jonathan!",
        "JB: Yeah. I think you can hear me. Don't worry. I'm going to stay close. Real close.",
        "Reva: Hey. Hi, sweetie pie. Guess what I found in the gift shop when I was window-shopping? \"Stuart Little.\" I never really got to read to you. I didn't get to read to many of my kids. But this is a great story because it's about a family who welcomes a new son into the fold. He's a bit different, but they still love him all the same.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: It's my fault. If I had had my way back then, Jonathan wouldn't have lived to the ripe old age of one. You sent him away because of me. You never knew him because of me.",
        "Reva: I really can't do this now, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: I'm sorry, Reva. I just...",
        "Reva: You know what? You wanted to kill an innocent child, and I hated you for a very long time because of it. And if I had been myself back then, you'd be a dead man. I wouldn't have thought twice about doing whatever I had to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: My father's dead. Can I grieve him? Can I grieve for myself without having to watch my back because you think that Sebastian has an agenda?",
        "Ross: What if he does?",
        "Blake: What does it matter? What if he does? Why do we have to live our lives always worried about somebody's going to take it all away from us?",
        "Ross: We don't, of course. All I'm saying is that I want you to be careful.",
        "Blake: I'm just saying I want to be alone.",
        "Ross: Okay.",
        "Blake: I'll see you later.",
        "Ross: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: I'm not going to lie to you. I am having a DNA test run.",
        "Sebastian: And I think it's a good idea. But you could have asked for a cheek swab instead of boosting some of Roger's ashes and snagging a hair off my jacket.",
        "Holly: I didn't know anything. Look, if you are so understanding, then you must know that I have to be very careful where anything to do with Roger is concerned.",
        "Sebastian: I knew you were running a test on me, so I guess you weren't careful enough.",
        "Holly: I guess not. Does it matter?",
        "Sebastian: No. (Laughs)",
        "Holly: What?",
        "Sebastian: (Sighs) I don't know. I just... When you took some of my hair and I felt you hug me and you put your hand around my neck, and when I felt your touch, it was nice.",
        "Holly: Should I tell you how bizarre that sounds, or would you like me to remain polite?",
        "Sebastian: I didn't mean anything by it.",
        "Holly: No?",
        "Sebastian: No. Look, I didn't know why you touched me at all in the first place, but then I figured it out, okay? Holly, Holly, you don't have to explain anything, all right? I know this is incredibly difficult for you and you need proof. Your love for Roger, even your hate... Look, he was a powerful influence in your life. He was a powerful man. He was your lover, a friend, an enemy. And you know what? I don't think that you've actually accepted yet that it's over. You haven't really accepted that he's gone, and Roger told me that you would take yourself away...",
        "Holly: You know what I would like? If you would stop using this \"Roger's road map to Holly\" as a guide for dealing with me.",
        "Sebastian: The only reason I'm bringing up what my father told me is because he felt responsible for the person that you would become. For your hard heart.",
        "Holly: Well, let me tell you something. It paid to be a pragmatist with Roger in my life, so you take anything he says to you with a grain of salt. And I have not seen him for ages. He has no idea who I have become.",
        "Sebastian: Oh, yeah, yeah. He had a pretty good idea. You know what? He was right. He was right about how beautiful you are, too, and how radiant and how passionate. So, this is Cedars, huh? Ed Bauer is the chief of staff.",
        "Holly: Dr. Bauer is the... Is on extended sabbatical. He's doing some important viral research in Africa.",
        "Sebastian: Oh, I see.",
        "Holly: Roger must have given you a real earful about everybody in town, especially Ed Bauer.",
        "Sebastian: Uh-huh, and he also told me that we should let the past remain the past.",
        "Holly: Well, you seem to know so much about all of us, but we don't...",
        "Sebastian: You will have every opportunity to find out anything you want to know about me. I have nothing to hide.",
        "Holly: Aren't you going to wait for the DNA test?",
        "Sebastian: No. I already know who my father was.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: All right, but you don't know that you hit a human being, honey. No, I'm sure it all happened very fast and it was dark, so it's hard to be sure, right? And if you looked in your rearview mirror, you didn't see anything on the ground, right?",
        "Lizzie: No. No, I didn't.",
        "Phillip: Okay. Well, that's what I'm saying. You probably didn't hit anybody. Just tell me what you did next.",
        "Lizzie: I came back home, and I parked your car in the garage.",
        "Phillip: Good girl. That's a good girl. Did you look at the car?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. There was some things broken on it, but there wasn't any blood or anything.",
        "Phillip: All right. Well, that's very good. If you had hit somebody, there would have been a lot of damage. It's fine, honey. Everything is going to be fine. Don't you worry about a thing. I'll take care of it, all right?",
        "Lizzie: Daddy, I can't help it. I keep replaying it over and over in my head, and I feel the thud, Dad. I... (Sobs)",
        "Phillip: Everything is going to be okay. You trust me. It's all right.",
        "Lizzie: Thank you, Daddy.",
        "Phillip: Oh, sweetheart. Everything will be just fine. I'll take care of it. (knock at door) Who is it?",
        "Harley: It's Ruth Karloff, sir.",
        "Phillip: Just a minute. All right, I want you to go up to bed, and I don't want you to worry about this anymore. We'll talk about it in the morning, okay? Ruth, what do you need?",
        "Harley: There are certain matters that require your attention, sir. Hello, dear.",
        "Lizzie: Hi.",
        "Harley: Oh, dear, sir. I hope... Is she...?",
        "Phillip: She's fine. She's fine. What is it that you need?",
        "Harley: If there's anything I can do, sir.",
        "Phillip: No, I told you. She'll be perfectly fine. Although this is not the best of times. If this is something that could wait until tomorrow?",
        "Harley: I'm sorry, sir. It can't wait.",
        "Phillip: Hey. What are you doing out of bed?",
        "Zach: I came to get teddy. I know you!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: What's the good word, Chrissy?",
        "Blake: There isn't one at the moment. But I like it when you call me that. It makes me feel close to my father.",
        "Sebastian: I'm glad.",
        "Blake: Can I ask you something?",
        "Sebastian: Mm-hmm.",
        "Blake: All honesty? Because you've thrown everybody here for a loop. You've got to know what Roger Thorpe meant to these people in this town. But I loved my father, and you're his son.",
        "Sebastian: Chrissy, I have nothing but love and sympathy for you in my heart. And I want to do anything I can to help ease the pain that you're going through.",
        "Blake: It sure is nice to be with somebody who understands.",
        "Sebastian: Hm. What about Ross?",
        "Blake: He thinks you're hiding something. Are you?",
        "Sebastian: Whatever I'm up to, it's all good news for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: Holly. I got your message.",
        "Holly: I had the DNA test run on the ashes. It's him.",
        "Ross: It is?",
        "Holly: Yeah.",
        "Ross: Really?",
        "Holly: I know. He's gone. Roger... Roger is really gone.",
        "Ross: And Sebastian?",
        "Holly: It's his son.",
        "Ross: So surprising, but should we have expected any less?",
        "Holly: I don't know how I feel. Peace or sadness. He made my life torture, and the revelation.",
        "Ross: And you loved him.",
        "Holly: You love your dog or a milkshake, rain on the roof. There were times when every cell in my body just ached to be near him, and he knew what he did to me. I hated him for it.",
        "Ross: And loved him.",
        "Holly: Because he knew me in ways I didn't even know myself. And now that's gone. (Sobs) I didn't want him to make me feel the way he made me feel, even when I liked it. It was too much out of control. But you know, when... If I wanted just a hit of it, just like a jolt, then when he was alive, I could have it. Not that I was ever going to go find him, but there was a comfort, you know, in just knowing that I could have.",
        "Ross: I know. It was an addiction.",
        "Holly: And now his son, when he talks to me, when he looks at me, it's so much like Roger. Ross, this is the last thing I want in my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "JB: What's up with you, beautiful?",
        "Tammy: I don't know. I went to give blood and then I came back and...",
        "JB: You freaked?",
        "Tammy: No, I didn't. You were gone and I just...",
        "JB: Whoa. Look, Tammy, you don't have to get nervous with me. I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Tammy: You did.",
        "JB: Well, I wanted to get you this.",
        "Tammy: You bought me a present?",
        "JB: Did I say, \"buy\"?",
        "Tammy: JB.",
        "JB: I just wanted you to have something. If I'd have been by your side, you wouldn't have been in that accident.",
        "Tammy: I was so freaked out. I thought I was going to die. That car was headed right at me. Sandy saved my life.",
        "JB: Any word on how he's doing?",
        "Tammy: He needs to have a liver transplant. But we have a big family, so somebody has to be a match.",
        "JB: Mm-hmm.",
        "Tammy: They're running a lot of tests right now to find out.",
        "JB: I hope they don't, you know, find something they didn't plan on.",
        "Tammy: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "JB: You know, like a preexisting condition. Look, I'm just glad it's not you lying in that hospital bed, babe.",
        "Tammy: Well, it could have been.",
        "JB: Are we... Are we cool?",
        "Tammy: I'm really glad you're here.",
        "JB: Good. I want you to need me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: You're trying to convince me that I saved Sandy's life when I gave him up, but I don't buy that.",
        "Edmund: I'm sorry, Reva. You don't need this. You don't need me here.",
        "Reva: No matter what, no matter what our differences might be, I do need you here. Thank you, Edmund.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zach: I think I know you.",
        "Harley: I'm sorry, no.",
        "Phillip: Zach, this is Ruth. This is my new assistant. I don't think you've met yet. Ruth, this is my son, Zach.",
        "Harley: A pleasure, dear.",
        "Zach: She sounds like...",
        "Phillip: Zach, Zach, Zach, Zach, Zach. We're gentlemen, remember? And I think it's time for all Spaulding gentlemen to be in bed. I want you to take teddy upstairs. You guys get in bed, and I'll be up to tuck you in soon, okay? Go on.",
        "Ruth: Fine boy, sir.",
        "Phillip: Yes, he is. Despite the influence of his mother and her family. Oh, you probably have noticed there's additional security around here for right now. I found it necessary to separate Zach from his mother for the time being.",
        "Ruth: Well, for how long, sir? A child needs its mother.",
        "Phillip: For as long as it takes. Let me tell you something. His mother has been poisoning my son's mind against me. He told me he hated me, didn't want to see me anymore, and that's not him talking, that's her.",
        "Harley: She sounds irrational.",
        "Phillip: Much worse than that, Ruth. She thinks she's right all the time. Yeah, she's always on the side of the angels. It's Harley's world, and the rest of us are just living in it.",
        "Harley: Yes, sir.",
        "Phillip: You know, I'll let you in on a little secret: My ex-wife Harley is as big an egomaniac as everybody thinks I am. It's how we ended up together in the first place. She knew she deserved somebody like me.",
        "Harley: Hopefully, she will learn her place, sir.",
        "Phillip: Yes, well. She just has to respect the fact that Zach is my son, and that makes him a Spaulding. If you would give these to the appropriate departments, that's it for the day.",
        "Harley: If I can be of service in any other way, sir...",
        "Phillip: Ruth? You keep this up, you're going to have me thinking you've got nothing to do but wait on me hand and foot. I want you to have a life.",
        "Harley: Yes.",
        "Phillip: As a matter of fact, the next few days, I've got some personal business to attend to. Why don't you take that time off?",
        "Harley: Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.",
        "Zach: Mommy!",
        "Harley: Oh, my boy.",
        "Zach: I knew it was you.",
        "Harley: Yes.",
        "Zach: Is this a game?",
        "Harley: It is. It is a game. It is a very, very fun, important game. Do you want me to tell you the rules? Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: So, if what you're saying is true and my father--our father--has more surprises in store for me, oh, I say bring them on.",
        "Sebastian: Do you still have that coin that he gave you? Do you remember? The first time he came back to town?",
        "Blake: Oh, yes. Ross doesn't know this, but I keep it in my purse at all times, for good luck.",
        "Sebastian: Yes. That's it. Father gave coins just like this to the important people in his life: You, your mother, Hart.",
        "Blake: Maureen Bauer.",
        "Sebastian: Mm-hmm.",
        "Blake: She was his only real friend. Is that why he had me go look at the lighthouse?",
        "Sebastian: Mm-hmm, yeah. And all these coins, they lead to something else. Something much, much bigger.",
        "Blake: Bigger like...?",
        "Sebastian: Something he left those he loved.",
        "Blake: Oh, that is so 19th century. Are we talking treasure, here?",
        "Sebastian: Father never gave me specifics, but yeah. It's here.",
        "Blake: Well, he gave you a lot more than you're giving me. Come on.",
        "Sebastian: In time, in time. Right now, I'm on the hunt for some place to lay my head.",
        "Blake: I would love to offer you to come to my home, but my husband doesn't like you.",
        "Sebastian: (chuckles) Yeah, well. Hey, where did father stay when he was here last?",
        "Blake: Regency hotel.",
        "Sebastian: Then that's where I'll be. Come here. See you soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Mommy?",
        "Beth: Lizzie. What on earth? Honey.",
        "Lizzie: Mommy, do you remember when we were in Arizona and I had that bunny, and the bunny died and you just held me, and you held me and you said you weren't ever going to let me go, and you said everything was going to be okay? Please hold me now. Don't let me go. Please?",
        "Beth: No, Lizzie. I can't.",
        "Lizzie: What?",
        "Beth: That's what I want to know. What? What happened? What did you do? Lizzie!",
        "Lizzie: I... I... I got some of that knockout drug that... The stuff when you want to get with someone that...",
        "Beth: Get with someone? A date rape drug?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. And I gave it to Joey so that he would think that we had sex and Tammy would break up with him.",
        "Beth: What?!",
        "Lizzie: Mom!",
        "Beth: Lizzie! (gasps in horror) how can you be so loving one minute and so awful the next?",
        "Lizzie: Mom.",
        "Beth: You are terrible. You are capable of selfish actions.",
        "Lizzie: I just can't stop it.",
        "Beth: Do you even want to? Do you even want to try?",
        "Lizzie: Sometimes I do, but sometimes I don't.",
        "Beth: When are you going to stop attacking the world? Why are you so angry?",
        "Lizzie: Because I'm alive, Mom. I mean, do you think I really don't go through the day wondering why I'm still alive?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: (screams)",
        "Man: The purse. Now!",
        "Blake: No!",
        "Man: You want to rethink that answer? Huh?",
        "Blake: Look, there's nothing in this purse that you want.",
        "Man: Just shut up and hand over the purse.",
        "Blake: You take it and you'll never have children in this lifetime. (Screams)",
        "Sebastian: Should I kill him?",
        "Man: No. No. No. No. No.",
        "Sebastian: There better never be a next time you see this woman, because it'll be the last time you see this woman. Do you understand? Hm?",
        "Man: Ah.",
        "Sebastian: I ever catch you with my sister again, they will never find your body. You okay? You all right, honey? It's okay. It's okay. He's gone. He's gone. He's gone. Ssh.",
        "Blake: (Sobs)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Lizzie, come here. When you were sick with leukemia, there was nothing your father and I wouldn't do, nothing we wouldn't try to save your life. And then when you did survive, I guess it never occurred to us that you might have a problem with just being alive.",
        "Lizzie: I should be grateful.",
        "Beth: You were very lucky.",
        "Lizzie: But what if I didn't deserve to be lucky, Mom?",
        "Beth: What?! Why not?",
        "Lizzie: Mom, you and Dad had all the money in the world. It's not like it was fair. It's like you cheated. Like I cheated death.",
        "Beth: Honey...",
        "Lizzie: What kind of person does that make me, Mom?",
        "Beth: There are plenty of people with more money than the Spaulding's, and when someone they love gets sick, sometimes they don't make it.",
        "Lizzie: I did. So now what do I do, Mom?",
        "Beth: You live your life. You live a good life, an honest life.",
        "Lizzie: Mom, I'm trying, okay, but look at Dad and look at Grandpa and Aunt Alex, okay? It's not like I'm much different than them.",
        "Beth: Don't you want to be?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, sometimes I do, but I don't know how to be.",
        "Beth: I see. Is Joey okay?",
        "Lizzie: Daddy fixed it.",
        "Beth: \"Fixed it\" how?",
        "Lizzie: He's away at college, far away from here.",
        "Beth: Lizzie, are you even sorry for what you did to that boy? You could have killed him.",
        "Lizzie: But I didn't, okay?",
        "Beth: Go home, Lizzie. We'll talk later. Or maybe we won't. Just go home.",
        "Lizzie: Mommy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to disappoint you. Please.",
        "Beth: You should be sorry for yourself. For the person you're turning out to be. Because until you want to change, I just don't know, Lizzie.",
        "Nurse 1: You had that hit- and-run kid?",
        "Nurse 2: Yeah, I did.",
        "Nurse 1: Hit outside a bar. Driver didn't even slow down.",
        "Nurse 2: They still don't even know if he's going to be okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Hey. Why'd you want to meet here? Unless you like torturing yourself.",
        "Harley: Well, it's completely off Phillip's radar. He's already destroyed it, right? We're partners, right?",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Harley: I need help, and it's not business related.",
        "Bill: What is it?",
        "Harley: It's completely personal, Bill, so if you don't want to do it, you can say...",
        "Bill: Harley, just tell me what you need. You know I'm going to say yes.",
        "Harley: But before you do, you should know it means getting in between Phillip and what he loves more than anything else in the world, and that is not a good place to be.",
        "Bill: Are you talking about Zach? Let me tell you something, I think the most important thing to Phillip is power and revenge. Look what he did to this place. So you just tell me, tell me whatever you need. How do we get your kid back?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Tammy? Do you want to go see Sandy?",
        "Tammy: Oh, I know he's still unconscious, but maybe if he hears my voice...",
        "Reva: I think that would be great. Go on. Um, maybe you can clue me in on a little something.",
        "JB: You clueless? No way.",
        "Reva: Yes. What I'd like to know is what Tammy was doing in a bar in the first place.",
        "JB: You have to ask her.",
        "Reva: I'm asking you. You were there. But it was Sandy who saved her life. What were you doing?",
        "JB: Now you're going to blame this all on me. Typical.",
        "Reva: \"Typical\"? You just met me. How the hell would you know what's typical and what's not?",
        "JB: By looking at you. I can guess.",
        "Reva: Really? Well, guess again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Man: Hey.",
        "Sebastian: Nicely done.",
        "Man: I thought you were really going to stick me, there.",
        "Sebastian: Really? Me, too. That'd be one way to make sure you kept your mouth shut. Hold onto that thought.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Harley, you just tell me whatever it is and I'll do it. Whatever you need.",
        "Harley: I just took Zach from Phillip tonight.",
        "Bill: You what? How did you do that?",
        "Harley: I made out like he was sleeping, and then I slipped him past security.",
        "Bill: Well, where is he now?",
        "Harley: He's at a hotel nearby with Marina.",
        "Bill: All right, then what's the plan?",
        "Harley: I need to disappear.",
        "Bill: Well, you've got to be careful. Phillip has resources.",
        "Harley: We have resources, too.",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Harley: I'm just concerned about the logistics, that's all.",
        "Bill: Well, you just name it.",
        "Harley: You don't have to give me an automatic yes. I don't expect that, okay?",
        "Bill: Right, Harley, listen to me...",
        "Harley: If you don't want to get involved...",
        "Bill: Listen to me. I want to be involved. I do. I mean, look what this man did to your home. He destroyed his own kid's house and now he expects to be loved and adored? Please. Just tell me what it is. I am on your side.",
        "Harley: It's just that this isn't what you signed on for, Bill.",
        "Bill: Maybe not. But I am here, so tell me. What do you need?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Stop right there. We're going to have words.",
        "Phillip: Beth, I don't have time.",
        "Beth: Well, make time. Have you completely lost your mind--again?",
        "Phillip: This could be about so many things. Would you care to narrow it down?",
        "Beth: Lizzie. Did you honestly think I wouldn't find out what she did?",
        "Phillip: She told you?",
        "Beth: Of course, she told me. And you want her to keep quiet. Is that an acceptable way to go through life? A life, by the way, she's not even sure she deserves?",
        "Phillip: Look, what she did, this is not a juvenile crime. She could go to jail for it. Is that what you want?",
        "Beth: What I want is for her to realize there are consequences for her actions. What I want is for her to be healthy. Isn't that what we both want?",
        "Phillip: What are you doing?",
        "Beth: I'm calling everyone involved and getting them over here so Lizzie can admit what she did. And then we're going to get her help. And I'm not talking about some lame intervention. I'm talking about... Phillip!",
        "Phillip: Lizzie made a mistake, one easily rectified. My daughter is not going to spend the rest of her life...",
        "Beth: Our daughter. And don't you get righteous with me. She drugged a boy and you want to help her get away with it?",
        "Phillip: Look... All right, you're right, all right? But the whole business with this Lupo boy has been resolved. It's not going to do anybody any good to dredge it all up again.",
        "Beth: Phillip, this permissive parenting, the excuses, the willful blindness, it has to stop. I blame myself as much as I blame you.",
        "Phillip: Beth, listen to me. You're a wonderful mother. Lizzie's problems are not your fault.",
        "Beth: Not entirely, no. They're yours, too. But I'm telling you right now; I'm not going to allow it to continue any longer. We're not going to destroy our own child.",
        "Phillip: Yeah, I'm going to be going out for a while. No, I don't want the driver. I'll be taking my own car.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: The thing is, JB, I don't like you much. And I'm warning you, don't cross me. And that includes whatever it is you're doing with Tammy. My main concern right now is my son. Don't get in my way.",
        "Tammy: You heard? About Sandy?",
        "Lizzie: I...",
        "Tammy: A car just came right at him, speeding at him and didn't even stop to see if... He could have died right there on that street. He still could die.",
        "Nurse: I'm sorry, Mrs. Lewis. I need one more signature.",
        "Reva: Have they found a match?",
        "Nurse: We lost a lot of time. We didn't realize Sandy wasn't your biological son.",
        "Reva: There must be something wrong with the test, because he is my flesh and blood.",
        "Nurse: Well, we ran the test three times. You're not related to Sandy Foster. There's no way he could be your son.",

        "Next, on \"Guiding Light.\"",
        "Reva: There's something I have to tell you, but you have to promise me that you have to keep it a secret until I can figure out what I'm going to do.",
        "Cassie: You're scaring me. What's going on?",
        "Reva: Just promise me.",
        "Michelle: So, what's the deal, Sebastian?",
        "Sebastian: You're in danger, Michelle. A great deal of danger."
