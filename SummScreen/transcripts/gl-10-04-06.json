        "Gus and Harley snag a woman who is selling drugs. Later, the two have a nice time at home with the boys. Frank comes over and tells them they need to go on another mission. While on the mission, they discover an abandoned baby. Social Services cannot take the baby for a while, so Harley takes the baby home. Between Harley, Gus and the boys, Zack and Jude, they name the baby Gracie. Gus is enamored by the baby and Harley seems to like her a lot, too. The baby keeps them up almost all night long and the next morning is a comedy of errors getting the boys ready for school. Later at the station, Harley calls Gus at home, who is taking care of Gracie, and tells him that he needs to contact Social Services.",
        "Later on, Gus finds the grand mother of the baby, whose real name is Sydney. Gus and Harley are sad. They start talking about babies and after a whole day of back and forth, go home, to bed, and decide they want to have a baby together."

        "Harley: Don't say it.",
        "Gus: What?",
        "Harley: Don't say it doesn't get any better than this or it's smooth sailing from here on in, or the bad times are behind us. Don't say any of those clich\u00e9s.",
        "Gus: Babe?",
        "Harley: Don't you watch TV or go to the movies? Any time they say that-- boom-- they're jinxed.",
        "Gus: Okay, stop. You had me at clich\u00e9. Over the lips and pass the gums, look out stomach...",

        "Zach: But super cop was just pretending...",
        "Gus: Yes, he was. He was just pretending. He was pretending to be one of the bad guys just to kind of fool the crooker who was responsible for that bad sugar in the first place.",
        "Harley: Crooker?",
        "Gus: Crooker. Yeah. Rhymes with... exactly. So then you know what happens? Badge woman, she goes in there, she starts screaming at both super cop and the crooker just to confuse everybody. She even goes up to super cop and hits him really hard. You know how some people do that? She hits him actually too hard, but that's...",
        "Harley: Such a baby!",
        "Gus: ...And this is what happens: Super cop has to get up and he has to do like this: (Screams gibberish) And he goes like this: (Screams gibberish) And gets him on the ground and goes like this... uh, uh, uh, and then he cuffs him, and he's done for.",
        "Zach: And then super cop saves the day?",
        "Gus: That's right. Super cop saved the day, and badge woman helped out too, she basically just called for backup. But you're right, super cop did save the day... but badge woman was very helpful, and hot. She was very hot. Because super cop can't keep his eyes off her. And then super cop knows he gets in trouble sometimes, so he stopped at the paint store and he went and picked up these swatches because it really makes badge woman happy to pick out colors...",
        "Harley: Super cop is my hero.",
        "Gus: ...On the way back to their super home.",

        "Harley: Wow, Uncle Frank, you don't have to come all the way down here.",
        "Frank: Why do you think I'm here?",
        "Harley: To congratulate us on our fine work at Towers, of course.",
        "Gus: Yeah, the dynamic duo does it again. We're just nailing those perps, bringing them in left and right.",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, you know what? It kind of almost makes me forget about that botched job that you guys did on the Springfield blogger in Vegas.",
        "Harley: Okay, that hurts.",
        "Gus: Who invited you, Frank? No one invited you here.",
        "Frank: No one did, but I came by to assign you to another case.",
        "Harley: Oh, no, this case. Yeah, no, no... we're going to interview the drug dealer first thing in the morning.",
        "Frank: Ah, well, not anymore. She started talking the second Marina and Remy threw her in the back of the squad car.",
        "Gus: I knew she was a blabbermouth, that one.",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, she ratted out her own husband. Turns out he was supplying her, so...",
        "Harley: Good wife.",
        "Frank: Yeah, gave him up in two seconds, so... I know you wanted to have the night off, so...",
        "Harley: No, that's fine. I'll just... I'll call Ashlee. You don't mind staying until she gets here, do you?",
        "Frank: Not at all, are you kidding me? Come on.",
        "Harley: Hey guys, listen up.",
        "Gus: Hey, guys, super cop and badge woman, his trusty sidekick, they're off on a new super mission.",

        "Zach: Cool.",
        "Harley: Yeah.",
        "Gus: It is cool, isn't it?",
        "Harley: So, you're going to stay with Uncle Frank until Ashlee gets here. And if you're really good boys maybe she'll take you to have sundaes at grandpa's.",
        "Gus: Frank, you can tell... tell Ashlee we'll be home in time to tuck them in, so...",
        "Frank: You think that's possible?",
        "Harley: Please...",
        "Gus: We're that good.",
        "Harley: We got it like that, baby. We're that good.",

        "Frank: Super cop, yeah.",
        "Gus: A little fries with that shake, baby?",
        "Harley: Yeah, baby. Why does badge woman always have to be the trusty sidekick?",
        "Gus: Do you really believe in that jinxing stuff? And what's wrong with sidekicks, anyway? Batman had Robin. Tom had Jerry. I'm not getting fired for that.",
        "Harley: Where's backup?",
        "Gus: Hopefully on the way. I just wish that Angie would've kept her mouth shut until at least tomorrow.",
        "Harley: Nice attitude, super cop.",
        "Gus: I was just having a good time with the boys, you know?",
        "Harley: We'll have more.",
        "Gus: Yeah, it is kind of cool when you think about it, though. Cooking hot dogs, picking out paint. We get to go to work together.",
        "Harley: Love that. (Gus laughs) You checking on backup? What are you doing? What?",
        "Gus: Okay.",
        "Harley: Oh come on.",
        "Gus: That's enough.",
        "Harley: Where's the camera planted?",
        "Gus: I'm not telling you.",
        "Harley: You want to spy on Ashlee?",
        "Gus: No, I just want to make sure the boys are okay.",
        "Harley: Yeah, not harassing out $10-an-hour babysitter? Did you hear that?",
        "Gus: What was that?",
        "Harley: I don't know. (Gunshot)",
        "Gus: Okay, I think I know what that was.",
        "Harley: I'll kick, you go low.",
        "Gus: I'll kick, you go low.",
        "Harley: Whatever. Let's wait for backup.",
        "Gus: I don't think that we have to wait for backup. We're up high enough in the building. The fire escape is down the hall. Where is this guy going?",
        "Harley: And when have we ever waited for backup?",
        "Gus: Let me ask you something: Do you really think I jinxed us before when I used the clich\u00e9?",
        "Harley: No, I think I'm losing my edge.",
        "Gus: It's just that I love the super couple, and I'd like to see them get home to their super kids and their super house and their super life.",
        "Harley: Yeah, that would be nice. Did he just open a window?",
        "Gus: You kidding me? He used the awning like a trampoline. I'm going to go after this guy and give him a knuckle sandwich.",
        "Harley: Wait, he left something behind.",
        "Gus: A baby. Who forgets their baby?",
        "Harley: I don't think he forgot her. I think he left her behind.",
        "Gus: It's a her?",
        "Harley: Yeah.",
        "Gus: Is she okay?",
        "Harley: She seems to be.",
        "Gus: What kind of dad does that, just forgets his kid?",
        "Harley: You know, the same dad who raised her around guns and drugs and a hooker mom.",
        "Gus: Give me your walkie. Unit 15, unit 15, this is Aitoro. Suspect is heading north from Clayton Arms. He's wearing a dark jacket and a baseball cap. Repeat, suspect is heading north from Clayton Arms. Let's get the kid out of here.",
        "Harley: Call social services. We'll have them meet us at the station.",
        "Gus: Okay.",
        "Harley: You know what? I think she could use a song.",
        "Gus: You know, I think those are scary and we should be quiet. She's calm now. And I don't know any kids' songs.",
        "Harley: You know the spider song.",
        "Gus: That's the thing, I don't understand songs like that. Those are scary. Spider songs and songs about three blind mice and bridges falling down. That's why our kids grow up with mental problems and they get sent off to boarding school.",
        "Harley: Just sing it.",
        "Gus: The itsy bitsy spider went up the thingy spout",
        "Harley: Down came the rain and washed the spider out (baby crying) up came the sun and dried up all the rain because the itsy bitsy spider went down spout again You don't know the song too well.",
        "Gus: I need work on that. I'm going to work on that. I'll work on it! I'll work on it. I know. No, I know.",
        "Frank: Excuse me. Hate to ruin the parenting here and the fun, but we have work to do, right?",
        "Harley: Could you watch your voice, please? She is in a vulnerable place right now. Who is the prettiest girl? She's the prettiest girl in the precinct.",
        "Frank: Don't let Marina hear you say that.",
        "Gus: What is happening, Frank? Could you tell me what's happening?",
        "Frank: Yes. I've got units all covering the north side. There are no signs of Driscoll, so...",
        "Gus: I'm not talking about that, I'm talking about with the baby. With the baby.",
        "Frank: Gus, social services is swamped right now. It could take a long time to get somebody down here. (Baby crying)",
        "Gus: I can't believe this. I can't believe there's not a line around the block of people trying to claim this baby. She's a newborn. Bump somebody up, call somebody at the top... it's a newborn baby we're talking about here. (Baby crying)",
        "Harley: She's like 10 months old.",
        "Gus: I'm just saying it's a baby. Can't you call somebody?",
        "Frank: I put a ton of calls in, okay? It's just going to take a while, unfortunately. (Baby screaming)",
        "Gus: I can't believe this. I can't believe this.",
        "Harley: Okay, you know what? Why don't you go home and I'll stay with the baby.",

        "Harley: No, no, no... no songs. No songs.",
        "Gus: Well aren't you going to breast feed her or something? She's probably starving.",
        "Harley: It's not a faucet, I can't turn it on. You go, you go. Tuck in the kids and then I'll tuck you in later.",
        "Gus: Are you sure?",
        "Harley: I'm fine. We're just going to sit here, we're going to do some paperwork together, right? Have a little girls' afternoon, right? She's going to learn things like \"Three-time offender.\" She's been working on that really hard. Go ahead, go. I'm sure that the kids are falling asleep waiting for us to get home.

You know what, while you're here, I'm going to check something out. What do you think of this color? See, I like this color, too. The girls are the ones that have taste. You're very beautiful, but you, my little sweetheart, are a handful.",
        "Gus: It's quiet.",
        "Harley: For now. Hey, at least the kids made the bus, right? They won't get fired.",
        "Gus: Yeah, but maybe we will.",
        "Harley: We won't get fired. We just have to protect and serve on one hour of sleep.",
        "Gus: Did you get a whole hour? I'm very impressed.",
        "Harley: Thank you.",
        "Gus: I'll tell you what, why don't you get out of here and I'll take care of everything, okay?",
        "Harley: Well, what about...",
        "Gus: The baby? I'll handle everything. I'll handle everything.",
        "Harley: Okay.",
        "Gus: You just get going, and I'll meet you down at the station.",
        "Harley: Okay. Just remember to call social services.",
        "Gus: Yes, I'll call them.",
        "Harley: You'll call them, right?",
        "Gus: I said I would. Hey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Looks like somebody could use another cup of coffee.",
        "Harley: You don't think eight is enough?",
        "Frank: You had eight cups of coffee? After two, you go ballistic.",
        "Harley: Grace kept us up all night. I mean the cute little pumpkin had a rough evening.",
        "Frank: Who is Grace? Don't tell me you named the baby. Oh sis, that's so wrong on so many different accounts. Come on. Listen to me, you're getting attached here. First you're naming the baby, and then you start picking out schools for her.",
        "Harley: So?",
        "Frank: So, the baby doesn't belong to you.",
        "Harley: Oh, humor me. I never had the joy of caring for a little baby girl. I lost that privilege when I gave up you niece Susan, remember?",
        "Frank: Okay, well, Gracie is a nice name.",
        "Harley: It is a nice name. That was Zach's idea. If it were up to Jude, you'd be answering to Spot. What?",
        "Frank: Gussy-poo coming and in today?",
        "Harley: He's coming in today after he talks to social services. And if they're as helpful today as they were yesterday, it could be a while.",
        "Frank: They just called.",
        "Harley: Social services called?",
        "Frank: Yeah, they were looking for you guys to call them this morning. So I guess you won't be needing this cup of coffee and you'll be able to get some sleep tonight.",

        "(Cell phone rings)",
        "Gus: Hello?",
        "Harley: Where are you?",
        "Gus: What do you mean where am I? Let me ask you something, can newborns communicate?",
        "Harley: She's ten months old.",
        "Gus: Oh, well, I think that our little Gracie said her first words. And they were, \"The Cubs.\" I think we got ourselves a little baseball fan here.",
        "Harley: Gus, social services called.",
        "Gus: Who?",
        "Harley: Social services!",
        "Gus: Yeah, yeah, don't worry about them. I have that all under control.",
        "Harley: I thought you were going to call them this morning as I was leaving.",
        "Gus: Honey, I've got to go, I think I have a little situation here. Hey, what's going on? Why do you look like that? Uh-oh. Okay. How do we do this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Okay, so has Gus put the call in?",
        "Harley: I think so.",
        "Frank: What do you mean you think so?",
        "Harley: I wonder what's wrong with her.",
        "Frank: I hope nothing.",
        "Harley: You hope nothing? That's the best you can offer me? Will you stop being a man of mystery? It's driving me nuts. Just say what you want to say.",
        "Frank: Gee, somebody's a little cranky, aren't they, with a little sleep deprivation?",
        "Harley: Frank!",
        "Frank: You want my take on this? I'll tell you exactly what my take is. Gus, the cop, right, finds a baby, wants to protect the baby and he gets attached, he gets very attached.",
        "Harley: He's a committed police officer, he's committed to his case. He's a good cop.",
        "Frank: Gus never plays by the rules. He doesn't care about the case anymore. He cares about that little baby girl.",
        "Harley: Can you blame him? He has a huge heart. Could you blame him for wanting a kid?",
        "Frank: There are other ways, sis.",
        "Harley: You know what, you're wrong. You're just wrong about this, okay? I'll take care of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Gus",
        "Gus: Hey.",
        "Harley: Hi.",
        "Gus: I was just cleaning up.",
        "Harley: Oh, yeah, wow. The house looks great. Where's the baby?",
        "Gus: With her grandma.",
        "Harley: Who?",
        "Gus: I found her grandma. Really nice lady. Good with the baby, whose actual name is not Gracie. It's Sydney.",
        "Harley: Sydney?",
        "Gus: And Martha, really, actually, was very worried about Sydney being with the daughter and the druggie husband.",
        "Harley: Martha?",
        "Gus: The grandma. She had a nice place up north. I guess I should get to work.",
        "Harley: So, Gracie-- I mean, Sydney-- is with Martha-- I mean, her grandmother.",
        "Gus: Yeah. Blood relative. They have rights. And I checked with social services, and... so now the baby has a home and you have your home back, just like you wanted.",
        "Harley: Stop! What do you mean I got my home back like I wanted? What does that mean?",
        "Gus: Did I do something wrong?",
        "Harley: No, nothing, the house is great...",
        "Gus: Because if I did something or no, I tried to take care of everything so you wouldn't freak out, but here you are, you're freaking out.",
        "Harley: I'm not freaking out.",
        "Gus: Babe, I heard what you said this morning, okay?",
        "Harley: What did I say?",
        "Gus: You said that Gracie was a handful. Look, I am not a fan of social services. If they had showed up last night, God knows where they would have put the baby. Or this morning, where would the baby be now? Look, it's over. We got our happy ending. What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: You think I'm crazy.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: I want to say good- bye. You got to say good-bye. I want to say good- bye.",
        "Gus: They're sitting right there. Hi.",
        "Grandmother: Detective Aitoro, good to see you.",
        "Gus: I want you to meet my wife. This is my wife, Detective Harley Cooper.",
        "Grandmother: Hi.",
        "Harley: Hi, so nice to meet you. Thank you so much for doing this.",
        "Grandmother: It's the least I could do. You rescued Sydney from a terrible situation. (Cell phone rings)",
        "Gus: Excuse me.",
        "Grandmother: That's quite a man you have there.",
        "Harley: Oh, I know.",
        "Grandmother: The way he questioned me, you would have thought I was one of your-- what do you call them?",
        "Harley: Perps?",
        "Grandmother: Yes. He went through the background information and then he quizzed me about the formula and how to diaper her. I mean, I mean that in a good way. He wasn't going to turn her over to just anybody.",
        "Harley: He's very protective. It's a guy thing.",
        "Grandmother: I think it's a daddy thing. I saw the pictures of your boys when I was at your house. I think a little girl might have thrown him.",
        "Harley: Oh, I think the boys threw him. He's their stepdad. But it doesn't matter, they adore him. And... may I?",
        "Grandmother: Oh sure, here you go. Say hi.",
        "Harley: And you know what? They adored you, too, there, little Gracie Sydney. You were the perfect little house guest. She was. A little loud, sometimes, but we forgave her for it. She had this beautiful little baby smell. So cute the way she sucked her little thumb. We're going to miss you. But you're going to have a great life because you have a great chance now with grandma. So, I'll see you around. Thank you.",
        "Grandmother: No, thank you.",
        "Harley: Okay, so about before, I was freaking out. But, you know, I walk in the door, the baby's gone, just like that. I know she was only there overnight. She's better off with her grandma, obviously, but... okay, you handled the good-bye better than I did. You happy?",
        "Gus: Well, you weren't there the first time. Believe me, I'm glad the station called me so I wouldn't have to go through it again. It's tough, you know, but babies belong with their family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: How's it going? Oh, good, I've been trying to solve this paint swatch case for weeks.",
        "Harley: You were wrong about Gus, you know. He didn't get too attached to that baby. He knew exactly how to handle it, just like I knew he would.",
        "Frank: Really?",
        "Harley: Cut the man some slack, you know.",
        "Frank: Is that why you ran out of here with such confidence?",
        "Harley: No, because you got me all fired up because I didn't know what to expect when I got home.",
        "Frank: What are you talking about? Listen, you like surprises.",
        "Harley: I hate surprises. I like routine. I like finding my shoes in the morning exactly where I left them the night before.",
        "Frank: I thought women loved a little mystery.",
        "Harley: Clearly why you are still single. But let's talk about you while we're talking about you. Let's discuss your life choices, where you've maybe lost perspective, where you've crossed the line after getting too involved in a case. Can we talk about that?",
        "Frank: Let's not. And that's an order.",
        "Harley: Good, we can get back to talking about me, my favorite topic. I don't like mysteries. I like to solve mysteries. I like to know what's coming at me. I like to see the ball before it hits me in the head.",
        "Frank: What are you talking about? You're married to the most unpredictable man I've ever met in my life.",
        "Harley: Say that again?",
        "Frank: Gus, he's a wild card. Not that that's a bad thing or anything, but come on. Please tell me you're not leaving again?",
        "Harley: I just got hit in the head. Gus? Gus?",
        "Gus: Hey, babe.",
        "Harley: Honey, before, when you told me that Gracie was, you know, gone, you said to me, \"Now you can have your house back.\" Do you remember that?",
        "Gus: Uh-huh.",
        "Harley: Do you think that's what I want?",
        "Gus: Uh...",
        "Harley: Why would you think that's what I want?",
        "Gus: Because we were just toasting last night to how perfect our life was.",
        "Harley: But is it? Is it really?",
        "Gus: No, it's not.",
        "Harley: And then it hit me, that I can't believe that we've never talked about this before.",
        "Gus: About what?",
        "Harley: Having children together. I didn't think of it, did you? And if you did, were you afraid to bring it up because you didn't want to, I don't know, mess up our routine?",
        "Gus: Uh, well... yeah. No, I'm not afraid of talking to you about kids. You've got three kids.",
        "Harley: Is there a point?",
        "Gus: Isn't that enough of a point right there in itself?",
        "Harley: No, it's not, because you don't have any. And we could sit here and say, \"My kids are your kids,\" but come on, my kids aren't really your kids.",
        "Gus: No, no, no, I'm okay with the way everything is. It's okay.",
        "Harley: You shouldn't be okay with it. It sounds like you're settling. Do you feel like you're settling? You hate my kids.",
        "Gus: Oh... what kind of thing is that to say? Are you... I thought I was the recovering drug addict here, right? I mean...",
        "Harley: What does that have to do with anything? I don't see that when I look at you. All I see is my wonderful husband who takes care of my kids.",
        "Gus: I'm just saying that I don't think you want any more kids. You've got three kids, I thought, \"That's cool.\" And if you don't want to have them with me, or you know...",
        "Harley: My point is don't you think this is something we should discuss? Shouldn't we discuss this?",
        "Gus: You want to discuss it?",
        "Harley: No. Because I should have thought of this. How can I love you as much as I love you and not have this conversation with you? Don't you think that makes me selfish?",
        "Gus: All right, listen, just stop. Stop right now. Stop.",
        "Harley: I just assumed that raising my kids would be enough for you, but maybe, you know, crazy thought, maybe you want a kid of your own. You know, a child that's a little piece of you that we bring into the world. You know, a good wife would have thought of that.",
        "Gus: Well, a good husband would have thought to say it sooner, okay, so we're both screw-ups. We both screwed this up.",
        "Harley: Can we fix it?",
        "Gus: We can fix it. You want to talk about it? Should we talk about it?",
        "Harley: This is us talking about it.",
        "Gus: Okay.",
        "Harley: So I was thinking last night, when I was pretending to be asleep, and I was watching you and you were holding Gracie, you were standing by the window, and the light was coming in, hitting the both of you... I'll tell you-- and I'm just saying this-- I felt like she could have been our little girl.",
        "Gus: Why don't we just put it out on the table. Should we be talking about having a kid together, because if you want to talk about it...",
        "Harley: What do you want?",
        "Gus: I don't know, you know? Our life is pretty sweet right now.",
        "Harley: You know, Susan is graduating in the spring. Zach and Jude are in school, work is good, we actually still like to spend time together, and you throw a baby in there...",
        "Gus: You throw a baby in there, it sets everything off. Can we do that every morning?",
        "Harley: Morning? How about every night? No sleep.",
        "Gus: I burnt the toast, putting the kid... he was in his pajamas. I was embarrassed because he got on the bus...",
        "Harley: I thought I saw SpongeBob today. I'm chalking that up to sleep deprivation.",
        "Gus: You saw Spongebob because Zach was wearing his pajamas to school, and I said, \"Turn that thing inside out before you get to class.\" But I did change a diaper this morning. And that was something. You know, I never actually changed a diaper before. I weaseled my way around it. You didn't notice.",
        "Harley: I noticed.",
        "Gus: You know, I didn't think it was that bad.",
        "Harley: Sometimes it's worse.",
        "Gus: Yeah, yeah, I could see how that would be. I can see how that would be.",
        "Harley: None of this for nine months.",
        "Gus: Well, good, clean living never hurt anybody.",
        "Harley: Pregnancy again. Yikes!",
        "Gus: Wish I could help you out, but I can't carry the kid for you.",
        "Harley: Oh, you'll carrying her. After she's born you'll be carrying her, the diaper bag, the stroller, the bouncy seat, the car seat...",
        "Gus: I've got to watch you go through labor again?",
        "Harley: Yeah, but I have to actually go through labor.",
        "Gus: Oh, big deal. Big deal!",
        "Harley: Doesn't matter, because at the end of nine months, we have this beautiful little baby and to look into your eyes, the man I love, and say, \"Look at what we made together.\"",
        "Gus: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jude: Any color we want?",
        "Harley: Any color you want. But be careful choosing because you're going to be looking at that color for a long time. So make sure you love it. Anything? Anything? Okay. You know what? Just these five then. Don't look at any of the other ones. Just these five. Okay?",
        "Zach: I want this one.",
        "Gus: He can't decide. I know how that feels.",
        "Harley: Honey, we have to be fair to them, too. It's one thing for a baby to spend a night, it's another thing when the novelty wears off.",
        "Gus: How was Zach with Jude? I don't remember.",
        "Harley: He was jealous, remember? He was jealous. It was a real adjustment for him. But look at them now.",
        "Gus: Yeah. I think it's good for them, you know? They had to learn how to be brothers to each other.",
        "Harley: Maybe they'll surprise us. I don't think there is any predicting how they'll do this far ahead of time.",
        "Gus: They do have some good Cooper genes in them.",
        "Harley: Some.",
        "Gus: My money's on them stepping up to the plate. Oh, man. My head is killing me.",
        "Harley: Mine, too.",
        "Gus: Well, you know, we can keep going round and round about this if you want to, but... I mean it depends on what we want, if we want it. And if it is... if it is something that we want, then we'll make it work.",
        "Harley: Do you want this?",
        "Gus: I'm not going to make... force you.",
        "Harley: No. Yes or no answer. Don't do that. Yes or no?",
        "Gus: It's both. I'd love to have a baby, you know. It's true, I would love to have a baby. But I'm not just going to have a baby with anybody. I'd like to make a baby with you. And if it's not going to be with you in my lifetime, then I'm not really interested.",
        "Harley: Is there some alternative person I'm not aware of?",
        "Gus: A lot of people find me hot, honey.",
        "Harley: I'm sure they do.",
        "Gus: I'm just saying...",
        "Harley: Well, it's not like I've ever done it before this way, either. I mean with somebody who's in my life, full-time, and present the way that you are. I mean, Phillip, yeah, for five minutes, but then it became this balancing act with different lives and different houses and it was a mess and... the thought of having you here every day at the end of the day with our family and our baby...",
        "Gus: So what are we saying?",
        "Harley: I think we're saying what we're saying.",
        "Gus: I think we are. I love you.",
        "Harley: I love you. A baby.",
        "Gus: Yeah. A baby.",
