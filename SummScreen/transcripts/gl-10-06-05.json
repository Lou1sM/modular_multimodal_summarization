        "Olivia: I just want to make sure we got all our bases covered. I mean, you checked in with our Venezuelan friends?",
        "Bill: Well, my dad got them checked into their suites. I'm sure they unpacked, starched their underwear. The guys we used to do business with like to party...",
        "Olivia: But not these guys?",
        "Bill: Not this group. Maybe... maybe I should warn my dad to soft-pedal a bit. 'Cause he can bring it on too...",
        "Olivia: You said they were going to come out tonight and relax.",
        "Bill: This is important. I'll warn them.",
        "Olivia: Come on. Your dad's been doing this a long time. He knows what he's doing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: My daughter-in-law tells me that these Venezuelans like it loud and fun, so my job's going to be to keep them having a good time while I set up the deal. Once I get it started, I want you to keep those all the vodkas coming.",
        "Ava: No rocks, two olives.",
        "Billy: Except I'm only going to be drinking water. You put one olive in my glass and that why I'll know there's no booze. Okay?",
        "Ava: Clear.",
        "Billy: Right. This is my forte.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: You really did not have to come with me, Daddy.",
        "Buzz: And miss out on a chance to watch a young junior executive take the red- eye to Europe? What kind of father would I be?",
        "Harley: I don't know. Mine?",
        "Buzz: I'm sure Alan never used messengers when he was running the company.",
        "Harley: Of course he did. It just gives me some time out of the office.",
        "Buzz: I thought that's what homes were for.",
        "Harley: My home is the Spaulding mansion, remember? Hey, I have a good idea. Why don't you move in? That will give me a reason to go home.",
        "Buzz: Oh, no. I already have a weak heart.",
        "Harley: Daddy, I wake up and I do business. I go to the office, I do business. Lunch is about business. Drinks, business. I... I head back to the mansion to have as much time as I can with Gus and the kids before I have to go back to the office for the overseas phone calls. My memo pile is like this big.",
        "Buzz: Is being a C.E.O. getting to you?",
        "Harley: It's the biggest challenge of my life. And you know the really weird part?",
        "Buzz: What?",
        "Harley: I kind of like it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: \"Marley turned the corner and walked into her past, walked into a flood of emotions she had dammed off years ago. She walked into warden D.C. Hammer. His arms were... like copper pipes\"? It's fiction. It's crap. Come on, frank. There's never a drug dealer around when you're ready to make a bust. I need a triple espresso to give me a kick. ( Yells )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Oh, Sandy, if you'd only proposed to me before this all happened, I... promise me you'll be okay, and I promise you I'll never take you for granted again. Never, I swear to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Well, I wish I could help her.",
        "Jeffrey: I wish I could help you.",
        "Cassie: You know, there's an old saying that you're only as happy as your saddest child. It's true. I wish you'd never told me about Hope. I wish I could pick her up and hold her in my arms and just believe that she's mine. But I can't. I have to know the truth. I have to know if Michelle is Hope's mother.",
        "Jeffrey: The story we have is so full of holes.",
        "Cassie: We can't expect Edmund to fill them for us.",
        "Jeffrey: No. The only thing we can expect from him is more lies.",
        "Cassie: So there's one other person that we know who can shed light on all of this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: I just need to eat. If I eat something, I'll feel better. \u00d1ot if I just keep eating crumbs, I might be able to survive. Nothing. Nothing. So I'm going to be hungry, but you know what? I'm not going to die because I'm not giving in. I'm not giving in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: We've been looking for Dinah for a while now. She's very good at disappearing.",
        "Cassie: She's the only one who knew what was going in Edmund's head. We don't know if this baby belongs to Michelle. We don't know if Danny's the father or not. And now Michelle has left town.",
        "Jeffrey: We can still get Michelle's D.N.A. A sample of it at the Bauer house or, better yet, here at the hospital. I can check into it. Cassie...",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Do what you have to do. I need to know the truth about Hope's mother. No matter what it takes, no matter who it hurts, I need to know the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: You bet you. It takes more than a killer body and killer instincts. You'll be ready to play with the big boys someday. Not today. Old Shriner would tell you how much crude was underneath the grass. He was amazing. ( Laughs ) Thank you, Sweetheart. Gentlemen?",
        "Olivia: Is your father drinking with them?",
        "Bill: No, Baby. That's water. It's the old olive trick. See, he works it out with the bartender. One olive is water and two olives is vodka.",
        "Billy: We'll have no empty glasses tonight, gentlemen. Ava, keep them coming.",
        "Olivia: Come on.",
        "Bill: Let him go. Look at him go.",
        "Olivia: I'm sorry. You worked so hard not to take a backseat at Lewis...",
        "Bill: I'm proven myself, haven't I? I already have everything. This deal is important for my father. I want him to have it. He's doing a great job. Look, I got you, a daughter. What more is there?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: I thought it was tough seeing you and Frank joining the police force, but losing my daughter to the corporate world...",
        "Harley: That's not going to happen. I'm still learning the ropes. But I am determined to turn Spaulding into a company that I can be proud of. I didn't expect it to matter to me so much. What does that say about me?",
        "Buzz: It means you're tough, that you love your job. Tough and determined make a success. Don't lose your priorities, you know? The kids, Gus?",
        "Harley: Who?",
        "Buzz: Me.",
        "Harley: Oh, Gus, of course. Gus and the kids. Why do you think I'm living this crazy life? For them. And I'll tell you, we're great, we really are. Me and him. Gus. Great.",
        "Buzz: C.E.O. groupies?",
        "Harley: Well, I guess they're reading the financial pages a little earlier these days. You can come over. It's okay. Is there a question you wanted to ask me?",
        "Woman: Marley, can you sign these books? You and Hammer are like the best couple since Bennifer.",
        "Harley: I'm flattered, really, and I know the author so I'll pass along your compliment. But sweetie, I can't sign your book. Sorry.",
        "Woman: Why not?",
        "Harley: I'm not Marley. That's a pretend character.",
        "Woman: I knew you'd be stuck- up. I don't know what Hammer saw in you.",
        "Buzz: Ooh. How the mighty and famous doth tumble.",
        "Harley: I'm glad you're enjoying this. I can tell you, my husband is not. Frankly, I don't have time for this nonsense. I'm the head of an international company, okay? This craziness keeps getting worse and worse every day. What are you looking at?",
        "Buzz: Look, people on planes like to read. You can't swat all of them. Let's get out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Come on, Crouching Tiger. I've seen the movie. I'm warning you, that kick you landed is the only one you'll land. Come on.",
        "Mallet: Hey, Loser, come here! Get off of him, Man. Get off of him. He's got a gun!",
        "Gus: This day keeps getting worse and worse.",
        "Mallet: What were you thinking coming up here taking off without backup?",
        "Gus: I had the guy right where I wanted.",
        "Mallet: He had you close to having your head pounded in like a board. Let's stop arguing. On the count of three, let's go. One, two... what the hell was that?",
        "Gus: A Chinese throwing star. I didn't think they used those things anymore.",
        "Mallet: He's probably got nunchucks, too. Let's charge him on the count of three. You can go on two and I'll sneak around back.",
        "Gus: Are you crazy?",
        "Mallet: You don't have anything to worry about. He's got lousy aim.",
        "Gus: Then you do it.",
        "Mallet: I'm a bigger target then you.",
        "Gus: He's not going for your butt or your head.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: I'm the District Attorney of Springfield. I want to ask you a couple of questions. Do you know Michelle Santos?",
        "Woman: Sure. I miss her.",
        "Jeffrey: She's gone for good?",
        "Woman: She still has a locker here just in case. Hey, she's a Bauer. They always come back.",
        "Jeffrey: Thank you very much.",
        "Cassie: Hey, any luck?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, they kept a locker here at the hospital for her so I think if we get inside, we can find something that has her DNA on it. That way we can run a test and we'll know for sure.",
        "Cassie: Okay.",
        "Jeffrey: Are you sure about this?",
        "Cassie: I don't have a choice.",
        "Tammy: Mom.",
        "Cassie: Tammy. Hey.",
        "Tammy: Look what I found. I was looking through Sandy's things and, um, this is the engagement ring he was planning to give to me.",
        "Cassie: It's a beautiful ring.",
        "Tammy: You don't sound surprised. Did you know about this? Did he talk to you?",
        "Cassie: He told me about it. He asked for my blessing. I was, you know, of course a little crazy because I thought you guys were way too young. But then I realized how happy you guys make each other.",
        "Tammy: When? When did he tell you?",
        "Cassie: Right before the accident.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: All right. Let's just switch the names and make this easy.",
        "Woman: Okay, first let me tell you about the doctor. He was examining the new intern in the doctor's lounge. You know the one with the red hair?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Okay. If I line this all up, I could probably make something that will last a few days. Okay. All right. Come on. I know I've missed something. I know that there is something here right under my nose and I am missing it. There has got to be a way out of here. There's got to be. There's got to be something that I'm not seeing. Oh, god. I've got to get out. Nope. Not gonna happen. Edmund, you stupid idiot! Well, well, well. What do we have here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Blue dog one, this is blue dog one. Officers pinned down. Shots fired.",
        "Gus: Stars.",
        "Mallet: Correction, stars fired.",
        "Gus: We need backup.",
        "Mallet: I don't know how you got us into this.",
        "Gus: I didn't ask you to come down here.",
        "Mallet: I'm your partner. Read my lips. Partner. You're lucky I came down here or you'd have a star sticking out of your forehead.",
        "Gus: Do you have an \"S\" on your shirt for Superman?",
        "Mallet: Do you have a \"J\" on your shirt for jackass? I don't know what Harley sees in you.",
        "Gus: I don't know what she saw in you, either. Well, you put your life on the line for Joey Nunchucks out there. I'll give you that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: I can't do this. I need to get back to the office.",
        "Buzz: You need a break and you'll get it whether you want it or not.",
        "Bill: A break for the new CEO of Spaulding?",
        "Buzz: What are we looking at?",
        "Olivia: Hi. Hi! So how's it going? Are you ready to throw in the towel yet?",
        "Harley: Absolutely not. No. No. Everything's good. I'm not going to say it's not tough, certainly it is. Things worth doing are tough and I'll make it work. Right?",
        "Olivia: I'm sure you will.",
        "Harley: How are things at Lewis? Are you guys busy over there? I bet you've got your hands full.",
        "Bill: We've got deals in the works. My dad is doing schmoozing over there. But me, I've been concentrating on the better things in life, like family. A new point of view, new perspective on life. No need to be king of the corporate world, okay? You can have it, sister. ( Laughs )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Oh! I'll break my hand doing this. Okay. The sink. The sink. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Come on. All right. All right, come on, I know you're a wall but you were once a tree. Come on. Come on. A tree that was free in the sunlight, growing. Let's go. Get free! ( Sighs ) Free.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: You know what? I'm going to be back and take care of that business we were talking about.",
        "Cassie: I'll be here.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay.",
        "Tammy: She's so cute.",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Tammy: I guess you finally have it all, don't you? The baby, the guy who loves you. You went through a lot to get her, Mom. You deserve all the joy that you're feeling.",
        "Cassie: Hey, Tammy, you have so much to look forward to, Sweetie. You do.",
        "Tammy: No, Mom. I screwed up. I let Sandy down. I mean, he had a ring, he would have proposed.",
        "Cassie: Okay, stop. You didn't cause the accident. You didn't, you know? It's one of those horrible things that happens just when you think everything's going to be wonderful. You and Sandy, you're going to get through this together. You are. He loves you so much, baby, with all his heart.",
        "Tammy: Mom, please, stop.",
        "( Baby cries )",
        "Cassie: Look at this. Both my girls are upset.",
        "Tammy: You know, seeing her here with you, it's impossible not to have faith in the future. She proves it, Mom. If you want something bad enough in your life, you can have it. As long as she's here and part of our family, we can never forget that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Woman: Give me another minute. I'll be right there, okay? Hurry up. I'm late. Come on!",
        "Edmund: Thank you. That's just what I needed. All right.",
        "Jeffrey: Excuse me, Nurse. Hi, my name's Jeffrey O'Neil. Is there where the lockers are? Doctors, nurses, and P.A.S? I'm going to have to get in there.",
        "Edmund: All right.",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, thank you. It shouldn't take long. You're sure there's no one in here? Okay. Anybody in here? Ladies? Hello? Okay. Let's see. Michelle. Michelle Santos. Is there anybody here? Still got it. ( Laughs ) All right. What do we have here? DNA. DNA. Well, this is good. That should do it. All right. Perfect.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Ooh! Okay. Wherever this leads, it's going to beat hanging out here for one more minute.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Hey.",
        "Cassie: What happened?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, Michelle's DNA samples are at the lab. They're working on it. They already have Hope's results so...",
        "Cassie: So now we wait.",
        "Jeffrey: It will be soon.",
        "Cassie: Soon?",
        "Jeffrey: Hey, you know trust me, no matter what the results are, you're going to be fine, okay? And I'm right here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: You okay?",
        "Olivia: Are you?",
        "Bill: Why?",
        "Olivia: What you said about letting everyone else take the lead at work? I mean, you didn't mean that.",
        "Bill: Well, every word, yeah.",
        "Olivia: Power is freedom, Bill. You know that as well as I do.",
        "Bill: Here's what I know, Baby. Give me a little kiss.",
        "Olivia: No. Bill, no, you need a challenge.",
        "Bill: You are the only challenge I need.",
        "Billy: Drink up, Gentlemen. I'll be right back. Well, are you all paying attention, taking notes? Because I'm in full bloom out here. I've got them eating out of my hand.",
        "Bill: The old magic is flowing.",
        "Billy: I haven't felt like this since my wildcat days. Kind of weird being sober with these guys, though, I'll tell you.",
        "Bill: You okay?",
        "Billy: I'm fine. I'm in my element here.",
        "Olivia: Excuse me.",
        "Olivia: Ava, another Rocket, please. Can I get you a drink, Buzz?",
        "Buzz: I'm good.",
        "Olivia: And how is that? How does that feel to be happy with what you have?",
        "Buzz: ( Laughs )",
        "Olivia: Thanks.",
        "Buzz: Good. It took me a long time to realize it, though. But every now and then I do miss the rush.",
        "Olivia: The rush?",
        "Buzz: The rush, you know. When you want something so much you can taste it. Only it takes over your senses.",
        "Olivia: Is that a bad thing?",
        "Buzz: No. No. It's just not as necessary as I once thought it was. It's actually possible to live a calm, balanced life and be happy. But that's what you and bill are aspiring to, marriage, a little girl, more kids along the way, work that you like, travel. I mean, you're this close to having it all.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, but there's just always something else, something beyond my reach.",
        "Buzz: There always will be. But when you reach you get nothing, reach all your life and you end up with nothing.",
        "Olivia: Are you trying to put me in my place?",
        "Buzz: I wouldn't dare!",
        "Harley: Sorry, dad, I'm done with that call.",
        "Buzz: Well, nice talking to you. Be careful what you reach for.",
        "Man: ( Speaks Spanish )",
        "Ava: Uno momento. I'll bring you your drinks in a second.",
        "Olivia: Well, everyone's having fun. A little too much fun.",
        "Ava: Two down, two to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: ...May be used against you in a court of law. Do you understand your rights as I have read them to you?",
        "Man: I know my rights. Take it's easy, man, them cuffs are tight.",
        "Mallet: You're breaking my heart.",
        "Police officer: Finally got him, huh?",
        "Mallet: All wrapped up.",
        "Police officer: You make a good team, guys. All right, karate kid, let's move it.",
        "Mallet: Don't ever pull a stunt like that again. Your grandstanding almost got me sliced.",
        "Gus: I don't need you looking over my shoulder, and I don't need you taking care of my wife, thank you very much.",
        "Mallet: Can we have a conversation ever without you mentioning Harley?",
        "Gus: Out of my way.",
        "Mallet: Oh, man, it's about that stupid book.",
        "Gus: I don't care about the book, okay? I just care about what happened in that prison, that's what I care about.",
        "Mallet: Fine. Nothing happened.",
        "Gus: Just tell me the whole thing. Go ahead.",
        "Mallet: She wasn't your wife when she was in prison.",
        "Gus: So you should have no problem telling me then, right?",
        "Mallet: Ask Harley, okay?",
        "Gus: No. You were the warden, she was the prisoner. So you tell what happened. Can you tell me that?",
        "Mallet: ( Laughs )",
        "Gus: Hey.",
        "Harley: Hey.",
        "Gus: Glad you found me.",
        "Harley: Are you okay? I called the station. They said you were up here playing cops and robbers.",
        "Gus: So you came running?",
        "Harley: No. I actually came to, you know, enjoy the view. And to enjoy the warm night air while I still could take advantage of it.",
        "Gus: Well, or we could take advantage of it by going home and crawling between our new wedding sheets.",
        "Harley: Home it is then.",
        "Gus: Perfect. After you.",
        "Harley: Yeah. So what happened? And where's Mallet? Is he all right?",
        "Gus: Why? You want something from him?",
        "Harley: Well, he's your partner, and I, for one, am glad that he's got your back.",
        "Gus: He's got my back.",
        "Harley: Wow.",
        "Gus: Yeah. Listen, I'm sorry, okay? But I just had a guy try to kill me with one of those Chinese throwing stars. I haven't seen one of those things since I was ten years old. Then I'm on the ground spooning with your ex-husband, so... remember him, Hammer, the guy with the copper arms?",
        "Harley: So it's about Blake's book?",
        "Gus: No, it's not about the book. It's about... it's about what happened to you in the prison and with him. I just... you know, I don't want to know. I mean, I do want to know. I don't even know if I should... if I should want to...",
        "Harley: Honey...",
        "Gus: Just answer me, okay? Did you sleep with him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: I'm thinking if we get out of here now, we can tuck Emma in.",
        "Olivia: Ooh, big plans.",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Olivia: You know what? I have to go over a few things with Ava, so I'll meet you at home.",
        "Bill: All right. Well, I'll be waiting for you. I love you. Dad...",
        "Billy: Mi hijo, join us.",
        "Bill: I'm taking off. I'll talk to you. Gotta go.",
        "Billy: Oh, come on. All right, who wants a refill? Yes, yes? Darling?",
        "Ava: I'm coming. Hang on.",
        "Olivia: One olive, water. Two olives, vodka.",
        "( Laughter )",
        "Billy: That happens to be a true story. All my stories are as true as the paper that they're written on! ( Laughter )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ray: May god bless you and keep you safe. In the name of the father, and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. God bless you both, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: Thank you, Father Ray. Father Ray, can I ask you a question?",
        "Ray: Sure.",
        "Tammy: Do you believe if you do something bad that you get punished for it?",
