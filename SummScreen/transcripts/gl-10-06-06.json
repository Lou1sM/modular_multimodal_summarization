        "Vanessa: Dinah? ",
        "Dinah: What are you doing here? ",
        "Vanessa: Well, that's what I'm asking\r\nmyself. That woman at the front desk is driving me absolutely out of my mind.\r\nHave you seen Olivia? ",
        "Dinah: No. But what are you doing here? Are\r\nyou here to pay me a visit? ",
        "Vanessa: Actually, I was going to call and surprise\r\nyou, but you caught me, so... guess who is moving back to Springfield? ",
        "Dinah: You? ",
        "Vanessa: Yes. Me and Matt, and your sister, Maureen.\r\n",

        "Ava: You're sick. This is a joke. You\r\nshouldn't be anyone's mother. Someone has to do something about this, and it\r\nlooks like it's gonna be me. ",

        "Coop: Hey, whoa, Ava. Hi, remember me. I'm Coop,\r\nyour boyfriend. I thought, maybe. ",
        "Ava: I'm busy. I'm late for work. I've got\r\nto go. ",
        "Coop: Look, I left you some messages. I left\r\nyou three of them. Did you get them? ",
        "Ava: I did. Yes. But I'm late for work... ",
        "Coop: Ava, it just seems like you're trying\r\nto... Ava, it just seems like you're trying to... wow, you have been trying to\r\nblow me off, haven't you? Ava, what is this? ",
        "Ava: What? ",
        "Coop: What do you mean, \"What.\"\r\nThis bruise on your arm. ",
        "Ava: I must have bumped into something. ",
        "Coop: Right, I think we both know what that\r\nsomething must have been. It was Olivia, wasn't it? Ava, what the hell did she\r\ndo to you now? ",

        "Josh: I think I have a bottle of wine in the\r\nfridge. ",
        "Cassie: And what might we be drinking to? ",
        "Josh: My new business partner. ",
        "Cassie: No, I thought we were just swinging\r\nby here to pick up some papers. You wouldn't happen to be trying to turn this\r\ninto something more, now, would you? ",
        "Josh: You got a problem with that? Hm? I\r\ndidn't think so. It turns out I didn't have any wine, but I did find us a\r\ncouple of... hmm. ",

        "Reva: You know what you should do, is learn\r\nto clean up your own mess. ",
        "Alan: You called us here to discuss Elizabeth\u2019s baby, Reva. \r\n",
        "Reva: Jonathan and Lizzie\u2019s baby. I mean, if\r\nyou just clean it up... ",

        "Tammy: You're married to Lizzie and you're\r\nasking if I'm leaving you? ",
        "Jonathan: Come on, it's crazy. You know that\r\nwe're not really together. ",
        "Tammy: Yeah, of course I do. But it's too\r\nhard for me to watch you with her, you know? And sometimes... sometimes I even\r\nfeel like... ",
        "Jonathan: Like what? ",
        "Tammy: Like I'm sneaking around with a\r\nmarried man. ",
        "Jonathan: Come on. ",
        "Tammy: Look, logically I know that you are\r\ndoing the right thing for the baby, but that doesn't make it any easier for me\r\nto take. I need space; time just to get away. ",
        "Jonathan: You need time to get away from me.\r\n",
        "Tammy: It hurts. It hurts me to see you with\r\nher. I know it's just an act for Alan. But I can't take it anymore. ",
        "Jonathan: What do you want? ",
        "Tammy: It's not what I want. ",
        "Jonathan: Just tell me what you want. ",
        "Tammy: It's not what I want, it's what I\r\nneed. Just until this is over. ",
        "Jonathan: I didn't even want the baby. And\r\nyou and Reva pushed me. Come on, it was your idea to live with Lizzie in the\r\nfirst place. ",
        "Tammy: I know. ",
        "Jonathan: That's it? You know. We could have\r\nbeen in San Francisco right now living our lives. And I would offer you\r\nthat if I could, but... ",
        "Tammy: But you can't leave your baby, I\r\nknow. You love her. I love that about you, Jonathan. I love everything about\r\nyou. That's why I can't be around. ",
        "Jonathan: So we're not really over, you just\r\ndon't ever want to see me? ",

        "Remy: I'll be back in a minute. ",
        "Mel: Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. ",

        "Billy: Is that a fact now? ",
        "Reva: Billy, I'm okay. ",
        "Alan: Other than being stoned out of your\r\ngourd, Reva. ",
        "Billy: You just stay away from Reva and her\r\nson, you got that clear? ",
        "Reva: Billy. ",
        "Billy: No, no, no. You stay away from my\r\nfamily or you won't even see me coming, Alan. I've got it handled. ",
        "Alan: You know, I remember when Josh used to\r\nissue Reva\u2019s threats. ",
        "Billy: Yeah, well, I fight a lot dirtier\r\nthan Josh. ",
        "Alan: Is that how you took his wife? ",
        "Billy: Gee, I don't know, Alan. How did you\r\ntake your son's wife? ",
        "Alan: Reva called a meeting to bring about\r\nfamily unity. And I'm glad you're here, Billy, because I want you to listen to\r\nthis. Reva, if you think you and your pot-head son are going to keep me away\r\nfrom Elizabeth and her baby, you are absolutely out of your mind. ",
        "Reva: Billy, no, I... it's okay. ",
        "Billy: Just a minute... ",

        "Reva: You have to get me out of here. ",
        "Billy: What's wrong? ",
        "Reva: I'm sinking, I'm sinking fast, I can\r\ntell. I thought I could make it through that dinner, I thought I could get Alan\r\nto back off of Jonathan, but I can\u2019t. I don't even know if I can get out of\r\nhere, Billy. You have to help me. ",
        "Billy: Okay. ",

        "Josh: I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought\r\nyou here. Anyplace else, but not here. ",
        "Cassie: Why, why are you apologizing? ",
        "Josh: Because. ",
        "Cassie: All you did was bring me back to\r\nyour place. ",
        "Josh: Yeah, to a place that holds a lot of\r\nmemories for me and Reva. ",
        "Cassie: Yeah, so? You're obviously finding a\r\nway to handle it, so I can handle it, too. We're fine. ",
        "Josh: Just fine? ",
        "Cassie: We're great. If Reva is pulling for\r\nus, then I don't know what my problem is. So... I don't know, maybe we just\r\nneed to make a few of our own memories, I think. See, now, I'm going to\r\nremember that. ",
        "Josh: Me, too. This is good. I like this\r\nmaking memories thing. We should work on this a little more. ",
        "Cassie: Okay, all right. So, I don't know,\r\nwhat about over here. Do you have any particular memories right about here? \r\n",
        "Josh: Let me think. No, no memories here.\r\nYou know what, I don't think I have any memories, honestly. ",
        "Cassie: (Laughs) Okay. What are you\r\nwaiting for? ",
        "Josh: That was too short. (Laughter) (knock on the door) Oh! Stay here, don't move. Excuse me. Okay. Hi, there. \r\n",
        "Joe: Mr. Lewis? ",
        "Josh: Yes. ",

        "Joe: Nice, isn't it? Tell Reva that Joe said\r\nhi. ",

        "Dinah: Well, I'm not happy because I know\r\nwhy you are moving here. ",
        "Vanessa: No, you don\u2019t. Now, Matt is going\r\nto be working with Josh again, and I have some very nice opportunities for\r\nmyself. ",
        "Dinah: Okay, and your psychotic daughter\r\njust broke up with her boyfriend, so therefore we should pat her down, put her\r\nin a strait jacket, keep an eye on her because there may be hell to pay. ",
        "Vanessa: No. ",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Mom, you are here to keep an\r\neye on me before we go off to Europe and be on the run again, right? Because you don't\r\nactually believe I have changed. ",
        "Vanessa: Darling, I know that you have\r\nchanged. ",
        "Dinah: Okay, then why did you set up the\r\nintervention with Harley? Because you don't trust me, is why. Do you know how\r\nhumiliating all this has been? ",
        "Vanessa: (Sighs) I'm not moving back to Springfield to humiliate you. And that lunch with Harley was not\r\nan intervention... ",
        "Dinah: Here you go again... ",
        "Vanessa: ...It was just a lunch. ",
        "Dinah: Let me tell you something, you're\r\ndoing the same thing you did when I was growing up. You're trying to protect me\r\nbecause you put me up for adoption. You feel guilty because of that. It has\r\nalways been because of that. ",
        "Vanessa: Dinah, you make me so mad. ",
        "Dinah: Well, I'm sorry, you keep on trying\r\nto bring the past up, trying to get those days back. Not going to happen, Mom. So\r\nyou know what, you stay out of my life, okay? Because you're only making things\r\nworse. ",

        "Frank: Go on. ",
        "Ava: Just some over- aggressive lunatic in a\r\npickup truck. He was tailgating me, Frank. I mean, he came this close to\r\nhitting me. And I... I don't know, I didn't get a plate number. I was too\r\nrattled. ",

        "Dinah: Yeah, sometimes. ",
        "Olivia: Is that because you're adopted. It's\r\na strange thing. I was standing there and I heard. Can I ask you something? Did\r\nit make you angry when you found out? I mean, did you want to get back at her\r\nwhen you knew she gave you away? ",
