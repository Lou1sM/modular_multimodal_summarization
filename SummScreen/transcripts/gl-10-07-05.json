        "Marina: Wow. You're pretty good at this stuff.",
        "Danny: What stuff?",
        "Marina: This romancing the girl stuff, but I guess you've had a lot of practice.",
        "Danny: Oh, really? Yeah, why is that? Because I'm just, oh, so much older than you.",
        "Marina: Well, that too, yeah. I figure you've had time to practice your technique on all the women from your past.",
        "Danny: There really haven't been that many. I'm very picky, you know.",
        "Marina: Oh.",
        "Danny: So do you like?",
        "Marina: I do.",
        "Danny: Good.",
        "Marina: I figured something was up when I was assigned to patrol the roof.",
        "Danny: Yeah, well, I have a direct line to the Chief of Police.",
        "Marina: So do I. So what did I do to deserve all this?",
        "Danny: You're just you, and I feel like there have been way too many distractions lately.",
        "Marina: Yeah, well, Michelle was more than just a little distraction.",
        "Danny: Yeah. That's over now. And tonight is all about you. I just want you to know that I am so grateful and excited and, um...",
        "Marina: Well, don't stop there. ( Laughs )",
        "Danny: Yeah, okay. And, um, honored to have you in my life.",
        "Marina: Honored?",
        "Danny: Mm-hmm. Yeah, honored, because you stuck by me through all of these recent complications. I mean, it could've been very easy for you to just say, \"I don't need this.\"",
        "Marina: Believe me, I didn't need this, any of it.",
        "Danny: I know.",
        "Marina: But I wanted you so much.",
        "Danny: Hm. Wait a second, \"wanted\"? Past tense?",
        "Marina: Oh, \"want.\" Present tense.",
        "Danny: Okay.",
        "Marina: And now I know that you want me too, and that feels so good.",

        "Cassie: Uh, no. No, not at all! You can call me Cassie. I've heard all about you through the years.",
        "Mallet: Uh-oh. All good I hope.",
        "Cassie: Oh, some good. So, uh... what's up?",
        "Mallet: Uh... I'm looking for Edmund. Is he around?",
        "Cassie: No. No, he hasn't been here for a while. So what'd he do now?",

        "Rick: Not now. Just give me 360. Let's go. Clear! ( Rhythmic beeping ) Oh, God. Thank God. We got a sinus rhythm. We have sinus rhythm.",
        "Tammy: It's okay. He's going to be okay. You shouldn't be here.",
        "Jonathan: There's a lot of things I shouldn't do.",
        "Tammy: Oh, can I go in? Is he okay?",
        "Rick: He's stabilized, but he's going to need time to recover, Tammy. This is not a good time to go in there, okay?",
        "Tammy: He's not any worse, right?",
        "Rick: Listen...",
        "Tammy: Rick tell me the truth. I need the truth.",
        "Rick: Honey, you've got to hang in there. We're doing everything we can, okay?",
        "Tammy: Maybe you think you did a good thing by coming here, but you're not making anything better for him.",
        "Jonathan: Look, Sandy doesn't know I'm here. Sandy doesn't even know he's here.",
        "Tammy: Well I'm just saying you're not helping him by being here.",
        "Jonathan: I'm not being here for Sandy.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan, please just leave me alone.",
        "Jonathan: What, are you just going to hang out here by yourself?",
        "Tammy: That's the plan. This is where I have to be! This is... I should've been with him when this happened.",
        "Jonathan: You need to get over that now.",

        "Tammy: Don't you get it? What happened between you and me shouldn't have happened.",
        "Jonathan: I'm just surprised it didn't happen sooner.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: I brought you up here for a nice glass of wine, and you have your hands in the dirt.",
        "Marina: Look, I know that we were just saying some real things just now. I just... I needed some time to breathe so I found a project.",
        "Danny: Okay.",
        "Marina: You know, I've been like this ever since I was a kid, okay? Something bugs me, and I just have to drop everything and throw myself into something else for a little while, and then I'm fine, really.",
        "Danny: Oh. So something is bugging you.",
        "Marina: No!",
        "Danny: No?",
        "Marina: Yes.",
        "Danny: Yes?",
        "Marina: I don't know. It's just...",
        "Danny: You don't know?",
        "Marina: You know, I've been on guard for so long it's just crazy to think that we're finally at that point where we can just go for it, you know? But believe me, I want to.",
        "Danny: So do I.",
        "Marina: Even so... the ghosts. You know whose garden this is?",
        "Danny: Yes I do, it's Michelle's Aids garden.",
        "Marina: She's always going to be around somehow.",
        "Danny: Marina...",
        "Marina: I know that you say that this is all about me and that tonight is my night.",
        "Danny: It is. It is all about you.",
        "Marina: Are you happy about that?",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Marina: I mean, as happy as I am?",
        "Danny: Um, hello? What do you think? I mean, I just created a holiday in your honor.",
        "Marina: No. No, I'm being serious.",
        "Danny: So am I.",
        "Marina: I want the kind of happy where we're in a room together and we can't not look at each other or touch each other. When I look at you I feel so many things, and I don't know if you have room to feel those things.",
        "Danny: Marina, I have room for all kinds of feelings for you.",
        "Marina: I saw your face when you saw Michelle and Robby leave-- all of your faces. I think I kind of actually would have understood if you had decided to go with them. Don't tell me you didn't at least think about it.",
        "Danny: I thought about it. I'm sorry.",
        "Marina: Don't be. I'm not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: So why did you say you were looking for Edmund?",
        "Mallet: I didn't. It's nothing official. It's just that Marina Cooper is one of my cadets at the academy and she came to me with a hunch about something, and I thought maybe Edmund could share some light on it.",
        "Cassie: I know that Marina had in her head something about my little girl, but it's okay. Hope's my baby.",
        "Mallet: Are you sure?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Yes! You can ask the DA if you'd like.",
        "Mallet: Oh, you mean your boyfriend, Jeffery O'Neill?",
        "Cassie: He's objective when it comes to his work, Detective.",
        "Mallet: I... I never said he wasn't.",
        "Cassie: No, I know, I know. And... but if you don't believe me all I'm saying is you can ask someone.",
        "Mallet: Cassie, there's no reason that I don't believe you. I have no reason not to. I just wanted to come over here and clear some things up, so thank you. Oh, my gosh. Look at that cute kid! Hey, there, honey. How are you?",
        "Cassie: You know, she gets a little fussy around strangers.",
        "Mallet: Oh, okay, I'm sorry.",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Mallet: We wouldn't want that to happen.",

        "Edmund: Ross. Edmund Winslow. How are you? That doesn't mean we can't be civil, Ross. Um, I was just... I was just thinking about Dinah, and... have you seen her? That's... that's really just a shame. It's a shame, I'm sorry, that she hasn't gotten in contact. Look, if... if you see her, please tell her that Cassie and I have her in our thoughts and that we are so thankful that she has given us the happiness of a child. Ross? Who else? Olivia! It's Edmund. Is Bill there?",
        "Edmund: Olivia, just please tell Bill that I called and have him call me. I'm going to have to call you back. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Edmund: Hello?",
        "Cassie: It's Cassie. I need you to get to the farmhouse as soon as possible.",
        "Edmund: Is it the baby?",
        "Cassie: The baby's fine.",
        "Edmund: Good, good, because I'm in the middle of something.",
        "Cassie: I need you to get here now.",
        "Edmund: My God. Dinah's already there.",
        "Dinah: You may think I'm gone, but you're going to make a mistake. I know it. You're going to make a mistake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: You don't care that I thought about leaving with Michelle and Robbie?",
        "Marina: Oh, no. I care. Oh, believe me. I was holding my breath the whole time at the airport, wondering if I was going to be going home alone and starting over. But the thing is, you didn't leave.",
        "Danny: No, I didn't.",
        "Marina: You stayed with me.",
        "Danny: I did. So why are you upset?",
        "Marina: I'm happy. ( Laughs )",
        "Danny: You're happy?",
        "Marina: Yes. I am happy because I can breathe. Because we can breathe. And before you were laying it on a little thick.",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Marina: Michelle's gone and you don't need to worry about it anymore. But I don't want us to have to force things, Danny. I don't want you to choose me because Michelle's not here anymore, because she's always going to be here somehow. I want you to choose me because I'm the one you want to be with.",
        "Danny: If you don't know by now that you're the one I want to be with, either I have been speaking Swahili or... or I've been a complete jerk.",
        "Marina: Yeah, well, maybe just a little.",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Marina: No.",
        "Danny: Are you serious?",
        "Marina: I'm kidding. I'm joking. I just... I don't want to have to force things and... and try things. I don't want so much trying. I just want it to be because there can't be any other way.",
        "Danny: Well, I want that, too.",
        "Marina: I know. Maybe I just needed to see that, you know? Michelle walking in one direction and you walking in the other.",
        "Danny: Marina, you know I'm always going to be connected to my family. Letting Robbie get on that plane with Michelle was...",
        "Marina: I know.",
        "Danny: But my feelings for Michelle were... they were wrapped up in the baby that she lost, and it didn't feel right to just turn my back on her. I never, ever meant to hurt you.",
        "Marina: Things hurt. You deal.",
        "Danny: Yeah, by ripping up poor little innocent plants. You okay?",
        "Marina: Yeah. I will be. Now... ( Sighs )",
        "Danny: Good.",
        "Marina: Let's... let's not just call this Marina Day. Let's call this national Marina and Danny Day.",
        "Danny: Okay.",
        "Marina: I don't want it to just be about me. It's about us.",
        "Danny: That sounds perfect.",
        "Mallet: ( Clears throat )",
        "Danny: Hey.",
        "Mallet: The station log said that you came up here to patrol the roof. So what's up, Cooper?",
        "Marina: I'm actually off- duty.",
        "Mallet: Okay. Well, it doesn't really matter. I just... I needed to talk to you about Michelle and Edmund.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Where is she?",
        "Cassie: She's sleeping.",
        "Edmund: What?",
        "Cassie: Edmund, no! The baby needs her sleep, okay?",
        "Edmund: Hope? Well, I wouldn't want to wake her, so why did you call me?",
        "Cassie: Because I want you out of my life and her life. You are not Hope's father anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Don't look at him. Look at me. Look at me, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: Sandy almost died in there and I am here talking to you about...",
        "Jonathan: Say it.",
        "Tammy: I can't... I can't do this right now.",
        "Jonathan: Look, Tammy, I know you care about the guy, and I don't want him to kick it either. I know how bad it would rip you up.",
        "Tammy: That's touching.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. Shut down on me, Tammy, do whatever you want, but I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Tammy: Then you can stay and watch me sit with Sandy, who I love, who I am committed to, who I should have been with when I was with you.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, \"I should be with Sandy.\" \"I should have been with Sandy.\" \"You should go, Jon.\" You make yourself all these rules. Why don't you break a rule? Maybe you'll actually get what you want.",
        "Tammy: And you think that's you? I love Sandy. And whatever this is between you and me, you know there are a million reasons why we...",
        "Jonathan: Shouldn't?",
        "Tammy: Look at him! Sandy wouldn't even be in that room if I had met up with him like I was supposed to. It's my fault!",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. It's your fault. It's my fault, too. But Sandy didn't get zapped because of what we were doing in the barn. Sandy got hurt because we spent the last few months trying to pretend that we hate each other, and we took him along for the ride.",
        "Tammy: No, that's not how it was.",
        "Jonathan: You felt things for me. You felt them and you covered them up, and I let you because I thought it was better off, but do you think Sandy would have stuck around if he knew all that? If he knew what this is? We kept him on the hook a long time. We could have let him off sooner.",
        "Tammy: You're wrong.",
        "Jonathan: Look, the last thing I want to do is hurt you, but I'm not going to sit around and watch you beat yourself up either. Sandy's accident was an accident. You and I are not.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan? I can't...",
        "Jonathan: You can't do this right now. I know. So you stay here and make sure Sandy pulls out okay.",
        "Tammy: That's what you want me to do?",
        "Jonathan: No. But I know you. If I ask you to turn your back on the guy now and you did it, you'd hate yourself even more than you already do.",
        "Tammy: Don't you feel...",
        "Jonathan: What? Guilty? No. Not for this. Not ever for this.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: I'm going to go.",
        "Tammy: I asked you to leave a dozen times. And now after you've dumped all this in my lap, now you're going?",
        "Jonathan: I'll stay if you want me to.",
        "Tammy: You should...",
        "Jonathan: Look, it's up to you to decide where it ends. What happened in the barn, it'll happen again.",
        "Tammy: No.",
        "Jonathan: Yes. Any time you and I are in a room together. You can make yourself more rules-- \"I'm going to stay with Sandy until he wakes up,\" \"I'm going to stay with Sandy until he leaves the hospital,\" \"I'm going to stay with Sandy until he can get back to work\"-- but do you think you can make this go away?",
        "Tammy: No. I can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: What is this about? I mean, have... have I done something?",
        "Cassie: Oh, gee, Edmund. Let me see. I left you the first time, and you impregnated Dinah with our baby. I left you a second time, and you went and bought a baby on the black market to pass off as our own.",
        "Edmund: But have I done something to make you doubt my ability as a father?",
        "Cassie: I want the questions about where Hope came from to stop right now. That's the only reason you're walking the streets.",
        "Edmund: Then you believe me when I told you I've... I bought the baby?",
        "Cassie: Edmund, I don't believe a word that comes out of your mouth, okay? I had Jeffrey do a DNA test on Michelle.",
        "Edmund: But I told you Hope isn't Michelle's child. I can show you the paperwork...",
        "Cassie: I don't want you doing this, okay? I don't want you doing this. As far as I'm concerned, it's see no evil, hear no evil.",
        "Edmund: Evil? Is... is that what you think I am?",
        "Cassie: All I want you to do is to take your things and go and let me raise my little girl, okay?",
        "Edmund: All right, I'll go. But I want you to understand something, Cassie. I want you to understand that I did all of this for you, because you mean everything to me.",
        "Cassie: Then you have nothing.",
        "Edmund: I know. But here you are in a house I restored for you with the baby I bought, and all of it with a man whose face you just could never stop loving. Maybe if you had been able to, our lives could have been very different.",
        "Cassie: Get out.",
        "Edmund: ( Laughs ) And I... I still love you.",
        "Cassie: You have done nothing but hurt me, and the fact that I have to spend the rest of my life keeping up with this lie just to keep my little girl makes me sick. It's like some psychotic parting gift.",
        "Edmund: Well, we can talk more about Hope later.",
        "Cassie: I'm not going to change my mind, Edmund. Is there anything else I need to know, Edmund? Because I really don't want any surprises.",
        "Edmund: You know everything you need to know.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Whatever that means.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: What's going on?",
        "Marina: You know those questions that I had about Michelle's accident?",
        "Danny: Yeah, you mean the ones you dropped.",
        "Marina: Yeah. Well, there were so many things that just didn't add up, Danny. I couldn't let it go. I actually thought for a while that maybe Michelle's baby was still alive, but I was way off-base. And it turns out that Michelle's baby didn't make it after all. I have proof now.",
        "Mallet: What kind of proof?",
        "Marina: The case is closed. There are no loose ends. I know that this must all come as kind of a shock to you.",
        "Danny: Marina, the only shock is that you lied to me.",
        "Marina: I'm sorry. Gosh, it must feel like you're losing her all over again.",
        "Danny: No, Marina. No. We didn't even know if the baby was mine, but I want to know everything that you did.",
        "Marina: Look, it's a long story that goes nowhere. I'm barely out of training to be a cop. I don't even know how to go about doing any of this, so I just poked around and asked a lot of questions, and Mallet gave me some advice, and Jeffrey O'Neill helped out a little. Please, don't look at me like that. I really only had good intentions.",
        "Danny: You had to know that if you found out the baby was alive or if she was mine...",
        "Marina: It could have changed everything. But I wanted you to know the truth. I hoped that you would still choose me, but I couldn't live with myself if you didn't know what was going on.",
        "Danny: All that time, I was putting us second so that I could take care of Michelle, but you were doing the same thing. You put her before us. I didn't know they made people like you. Marina, you have the... you have the purest heart.",
        "Marina: No. I don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: So you're done denying it? You admit that there is something here with us.",
        "Rick: Tammy? Give me a few minutes alone with Sandy and then you can go in and see him, okay?",
        "Tammy: Thank you.",
        "Rick: All right.",
        "Tammy: Oh, God. What am I doing? He was going to propose to me that night, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: I thought we weren't talking about him.",
        "Tammy: You said it yourself. We made him a part of this. Did you hear me? He was going to propose...",
        "Jonathan: I saw you put on the ring.",
        "Tammy: Oh.",
        "Jonathan: You don't have it on now.",
        "Tammy: I was going to say \"yes.\"",
        "Jonathan: You don't have it on now.",
        "Tammy: I'll wait until he asks me.",
        "Jonathan: And then what are you going to say? After you just admitted how you...",
        "Tammy: I'll say yes. I will still marry him.",
        "Jonathan: Then you're crazy.",
        "Tammy: No, not anymore.",
        "Jonathan: I'm leaving.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan!",
        "Jonathan: You need to stay with him now. I get that. You need me, I'm here.",
        "Rick: Tammy?",
        "Tammy: I know it's a bad thing that he hasn't woken up yet.",
        "Rick: Tammy, it's not what I'd like to see.",
        "Tammy: He's not getting any worse, right?",
        "Rick: Sweetheart, the longer he's out, the harder it's going to be for him to come back. So it might be a good thing for you to contact his family.",
        "Tammy: He doesn't have any. I mean, none that I know of. God, how can I not know...",
        "Rick: Tammy. Sweetheart, you're here. Okay? That's a very good thing. I mean, who wouldn't want to wake up and see your face?",
        "Tammy: Then he will wake up?",
        "Rick: I hope so.",
        "Tammy: You won't say that he's going to be okay. Why won't you just say...",
        "Rick: Tammy, Tammy, Tammy. It's up to him now, sweetie. Okay? And maybe to you, too. Hang in there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: There you are, sweetie. You're so beautiful. I guess we're both having a rough night, aren't we? Yeah. But it's a beautiful night, isn't it? It feels so good to get some air. You know what, sweetie? Tomorrow is a new day for us. It's the first official day without Edmund. I don't really know where you came from, but you are right where you belong. Here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: I just bet you're out there right now, just talking about how crazy Edmund is. Crazy Edmund. Good luck making them believe it, Dinah. Good luck. Because there's going to be no evidence left. And you're just going to be the girl that cried \"farmhouse.\" Cassie and I and Hope are just going to sit back and laugh.",

        "Marina: I am no Saint, Danny. I never put Michelle before us.",
        "Danny: Then why didn't you just stop asking questions about her baby?",
        "Marina: Because I put you before everything. I see you with Robbie, and you love being a dad. You didn't even know if Michelle's baby was yours or not, and you grieved for her as if she was. And the thought of your little girl just out there somewhere, missing the chance to have you for her daddy... I never could have forgiven myself for giving up on her. Oh, God, but I wanted to stop so many times. I wanted Michelle to just go away. How do you like my pure heart now?",
        "Danny: I love it as much as I did before. Probably more. I don't know what I did to deserve you; I really don't. You are so brave and so real and so honest. Me, I'm just... I don't know...",
        "Marina: Mine. You're all mine, and that's all I need to know.",

        "Cassie: Jonathan? What are you doing here?",
        "Jonathan: Nothing. I'm already gone.",
        "Cassie: Wait. Wait.",
        "Jonathan: All right, look. I didn't touch anything. I didn't break anything. There's not a haystack out of place.",
        "Cassie: I don't want to talk to you about that. I want to talk to you about Tammy. I know what you did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Please, God. I know I made a terrible mistake. These thoughts I've been having, these feelings are wrong. I don't know why Sandy has to be here, why he had to get hurt. But if it's because Jonathan and I... please just... just have him get better. I'll do anything. Just have him be okay. And I'll never see Jonathan again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop: Edmund Winslow. This is everything. Arrest records, associates, property owned.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, you know what? I don't think I need it anymore because apparently this case is closed. But thanks anyway. Oh, you know what? You came all the way down here. I guess it wouldn't hurt to take a peek. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Cassie. Come on, I've got to get through to you. Come on, come on. You'll get me out of here. Edmund will do whatever you say. For once that might work for me. Let something just work for me. Come on, phone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: There we go. Very nice. And, of course, one more for the road. Very good. No one will ever know this place ever existed. Wherever Dinah is, no one will ever believe her. Ciao, Bella.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Look, I don't know what Tammy told you, but...",
        "Cassie: Tammy didn't tell me anything. You know that Hope wasn't the baby that Dinah carried. Edmund told me you asked about it.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. So?",
        "Cassie: So I know he told you how he got Hope, and you could have used it against us and you didn't, and I just want to say thank you for that.",
        "Jonathan: Sure. Whatever.",
        "Cassie: And you could have told Tammy and for some reason you didn't. I just think the less she knows about this, the better.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. Yeah. Tammy's... she's really excited to have a little kid sister.",
        "Cassie: Well, you know, whatever your reason, I don't know. I just want to say that I can see that... I just think that maybe you have...",
        "Jonathan: Are you trying to tell me that I'm not that bad?",
        "Cassie: Okay, you're different. I don't know what's changed about you, but yeah. You're different. ( Cell phone ringing ) I hope this is Mrs. Chitwood. Hello?",
        "Dinah: Cassie, it's Dinah.",
        "Cassie: Dinah?",

        "Olivia: When I saw him take a drink...",
        "Josh: It's okay. You did the right thing. What the hell are you doing?",
        "Edmund: No one will ever know this place ever existed. Wherever Dinah is, no one will ever believe her.",
