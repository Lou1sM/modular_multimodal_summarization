        "Maureen: Oops, dropped that one. We're going to have to toss it. It's too bruised to use. Now, Michelle, I'm going to let you in on this secret of Grandma Bee's famous apple pie. It's all about slicing the apples nice and thin, like this. Watch please. I want you to learn how to do this so that you can help stuff pies for next summer's barbecue. Now remember, nice and thin slices and lots of cinnamon. That's the secret.",
        "Michelle: Mom. Why is this happening?",
        "Tony: Hey.",
        "Michelle: Hi.",
        "Tony: What's up?",

        "Cassie: Who are you?",
        "Sebastian: Sebastian. I'm Hart's half-brother.",
        "Cassie: Blake told me you were in town. Hi. It's nice to meet you.",

        "Cassie: No. Come on in. Come on in.",
        "Sebastian: Thanks.",
        "Cassie: I was just going to see my sister. But I can wait a few minutes.",
        "Sebastian: Reva. How's she doing?",
        "Cassie: She's recovering. How'd you know?",
        "Sebastian: Blake.",
        "Cassie: Of course. (Laughs)",
        "Sebastian: I take it news travels fast with my sister around.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, you could say that.",
        "Sebastian: Mm-hmm. Nice. Nice. My father told me about this place, but it's not exactly the way I pictured it.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, we've done some remodeling.",
        "Sebastian: That explains it. Maybe you can explain something else to me.",
        "Cassie: Well, I can try.",

        "Man #2: What's up?",
        "Man #3: Whoa!",
        "Bartender: Hey, lady, what do you think you're doing?",
        "Dinah: I'm having some fun. You guys want to have some fun?",
        "Man #1: She's fine.",
        "Bartender: I'm sorry, but you're going to have to get down.",
        "Dinah: Who says? The bar police? Come on, you guys, you don't want me to get down, do you?",
        "Man #2: No, no.",
        "Dinah: No.",
        "Bartender: Would you please get down? I just called your friend. He's going to be here any minute.",
        "Dinah: My friend. I have no friends except for these guys here.",
        "Man #1: We're friends. We're friends.",
        "Bartender: Lady, you're going to have to get down.",

        "Man #1: Yeah! Whoo!",
        "Dinah: And you, my sweet, man, won't be able to tell me what to do. What song do you want to hear, huh?",
        "Man #1: Any song you want, honey. Any song you want, honey.",
        "Dinah: Let's... let's pump it up. Let's do it.",

        "Reva: How long before we know whether he's out of the woods?",
        "Nurse: Oh, don't worry, Ms. Lewis. He's young, he's strong. The doctors are very optimistic.",
        "Reva: You know, he's still burning up.",
        "Nurse: Once the medicine takes effect, his fever will come down, and you should get back. Get some rest.",
        "Reva: Just five more minutes.",
        "Nurse: All right. But just five.",
        "Reva: I don't know how to tell you you're not my son. I know the real Jonathan's out there somewhere. But you and I share something they can't take away.",
        "Delivery person: Is this Sandy Foster's room?",
        "JB: Yeah, yeah. But I could have saved you the trip. He's not going to make it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Big deal. I remembered something. Whoo-hoo. What did you have for lunch yesterday?",
        "Tony: I had pizza. Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. What did you remember? Tell me. Hmm?",
        "Michelle: It was just like the other ones. I remembered my Mom, Maureen.",
        "Tony: Okay, so you had more than one?",
        "Michelle: Yeah, I had a couple. One of them was really disturbing, because I think I was at my Mom's funeral. But the others...",
        "Tony: Thank you.",
        "Michelle: Thanks. The other two were really warm and comforting.",
        "Tony: Well, that's good, right? That's what they're supposed to be. Moms are supposed to be that way, right?",
        "Michelle: Yeah, but you know the other weird thing, Tony? Is that every time I get one of these flashes of memory, I have this coin with me. And I never even had one of these until after that guy Sebastian came around and told me that his father gave this coin to my mom.",
        "Tony: Okay, so what? Is that why you're not getting rid of it when I told you to the other day?",
        "Michelle: Well, it is kind of like my connection to the past. My Mom.",
        "Tony: Okay.",
        "Michelle: And, Tony, I've got to tell you, I love the way I feel when I remember her. I mean, I thought getting my memory back was going to be like someone holding a pillow over my face. But instead, it's just been like a feeling of being wrapped in a blanket. I'm just kind of wondering if it's going to happen again.",
        "Tony: Well, I think it will. It will. I mean, what? This is four, five times now?",
        "Michelle: Third.",
        "Tony: You know, I'm just curious that had I not walked in here right now, would you have told me any of this stuff?",
        "Michelle: Maybe not.",
        "Tony: Didn't think so.",
        "Michelle: Look, I like how we are together.",
        "Tony: I know.",
        "Michelle: And me telling you that I remember the past, you know, that might change what we have right now. And I don't want that to change.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Look; I want you to know that making the decision to set Dinah free was very difficult for me.",
        "Sebastian: I'm sure it was.",
        "Cassie: I couldn't relive the nightmare, and I couldn't put my family through that.",
        "Sebastian: Cassie, look, we just met. You don't have to justify your decision to me. I just hope that you're safe, you know, because Dinah seems unpredictable, dangerous.",
        "Cassie: She is. She is. And I was very worried about her. I still am worried. I just... I don't know. She saved my son.",
        "Sebastian: In the fire.",
        "Cassie: Yes.",
        "Sebastian: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: And she saved me, too, so...",
        "Sebastian: Yeah, well, you know, that says something, I suppose. But what comes around goes around. And that's the way of the universe, you know.",
        "Cassie: You sound like Hart.",
        "Sebastian: I do?",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Sebastian: Hmm.",
        "Cassie: He believed people always got what they deserved.",
        "Sebastian: My brother was a lucky man. So is my nephew around here?",
        "Cassie: Yes, he is. He's upstairs playing with his little brother, and they're with the nanny. Do you want me to get him?",
        "Sebastian: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: Okay. I'll be right back.",
        "Sebastian: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: (Laughs) hey, Eddie Ambassador. What are you doing here?",
        "Edmund: Well, apparently I'm here to keep the peace.",
        "Dinah: Oh, keep the peace? Let's see, do we want to keep the peace?",
        "Men: No! We don't.",
        "Edmund: It's not that I care or I know what I'm talking about, but you really should come down from there.",
        "Dinah: Oh, well, I know you don't care, so why are you wasting your breath?",
        "Edmund: The bartender called me.",
        "Dinah: Oh, I see, okay. So basically he wants you to save me, is that it?",
        "Edmund: Actually, I don't know whom I was coming to save.",
        "Dinah: Oh. Well, in that case, just go ahead and hit the road, buddy, because I don't need anybody to save me.",
        "Edmund: You don't. Thus spoke the girl with the broken head.",
        "Dinah: You know what? Life sucks anyway.",
        "Edmund: Really? You've been out of jail for what, less than a week free as a bird, and you're already complaining?",
        "Dinah: Why don't you be me for a day, huh?",
        "Edmund: I was. And like you, I got a second chance, and unlike you I didn't blow it.",
        "Dinah: Oh, is that what you think I'm doing, blowing it?",
        "Edmund: Well, let's see. You're on a pool table in a bar taking off your clothes. You draw the conclusion.",
        "Dinah: You know what? Why don't I just let you in on a little secret, huh? Since you and I love secrets. It was much easier being a princess.",
        "Edmund: Well, how nice. I found being a royal not very rewarding.",
        "Dinah: Oh, no, it was just easy being somebody else, you know, playing a role, living life by a script.",
        "Edmund: Oh, so, it's just play-acting?",
        "Dinah: That's right. I loved the respect. I even loved the attention even more. Huh?",
        "Edmund: Isn't that what drives everything you do? Don't you just love the attention? Isn't that what's behind this little display?",
        "Dinah: Oh, my gosh, Edmund, you know me so well. Yeah, that's what I want, just a little more attention.",
        "Men: Yeah!",
        "Dinah: Why don't you go back to Green Acres, hoe the back 40 and shuck some corn?",
        "Edmund: Well, \"it is the place to be.\" Enjoy your hangover. Excuse me, gentlemen.",
        "Dinah: Fine, go, walk away. That's what they all do. That's what Hart did until he met his little slut Cassie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "JB: Want to go for a spin?",
        "Reva: Not with you at the controls. I'd rather crawl back to my room. Thank you very much.",
        "JB: I'm hurt.",
        "Reva: You know what? Take your hurt and your concern and go find some little old lady to wheel out into the traffic.",
        "JB: Are you're volunteering? No offense. I just mean you're old enough to be my mother.",
        "Reva: I should be so lucky.",
        "JB: My Mom's dead. I lost her on the operating table.",
        "Reva: I don't know whether to believe you or not.",
        "JB: Why would I joke around about something like that?",
        "Reva: Then I'm sorry.",
        "JB: People die. How's your son?",
        "Reva: What is wrong with you?",
        "JB: Did I say something?",
        "Reva: You don't belong here.",
        "JB: I never do. But Tammy seems to disagree.",
        "Reva: Well, Tammy's a kid. She's vulnerable. You've got her fooled, but you don't have me fooled.",
        "JB: You sure about that?",
        "Reva: Do us all a favor, especially Tammy...",
        "Tammy: Especially Tammy, what?",
        "JB: I don't think your aunt wants me to be here.",
        "Reva: Whatever gave you that idea?",
        "JB: She's worried about your cousin.",
        "Tammy: Oh, were you checking on them?",
        "JB: Yeah, yeah. I was just about to take her back to her room.",
        "Tammy: How is Sandy?",
        "Reva: He's still running a really high fever. He may reject the transplant.",
        "JB: Yeah, rejection's a bitch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Rock music playing) Edmund: Dinah.",
        "Dinah: What's wrong? Does the truth hurt, Edmund? Had a crazy week. Does anybody want to hear about my crazy week?",
        "Men: Yeah, I want to hear it!",
        "Edmund: Shut up, Dinah. I'm warning you.",
        "Dinah: What are you warning me against? These are my friends. You're my friends, right?",
        "Men: Yeah! Come on, dance! Take a little more off!",
        "Dinah: (Laughs) I had a horrible week last week. Yeah, this woman... this woman who says that she's an upstanding citizen, she grabbed me, took a gun, put it right to my...",
        "Edmund: Shut up.",
        "Dinah: What are you doing? Let me go.",
        "Edmund: No, and let you tell everyone what's been going on? I don't think so.",
        "Dinah: I'm just telling the truth, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: I don't care. You're not going to say anything that hurts Cassie and her family.",
        "Dinah: Oh, Cassie, Cassie, Cassie. Why is it always about Cassie?",
        "Edmund: Oh, no, you don't.",
        "Dinah: You're not going to make me do anything.",
        "Edmund: Oh, really, young lady? Tonight that's exactly what I'm doing.",
        "Dinah: Make me.",
        "Edmund: All right.",
        "Dinah: (Screams)",
        "Men: Come on!",
        "Cassie: Sebastian, this is RJ, RJ, this is your uncle Sebastian. He's your father's brother.",
        "Sebastian: RJ, hey. Yikes, what a grip. I wouldn't want to arm wrestle you. You know, I never met your daddy, but I saw pictures, and you look a lot like him, and you have a little bit of your granddaddy in you, too. I think it's in the eyes.",
        "Cassie: Are you going to be in town for a while?",
        "Sebastian: Yeah, for a while.",
        "Cassie: Because I'd really like you to spend some time with RJ.",
        "Sebastian: Really?",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Sebastian: I'd like that. Would you like that? All right.",
        "Cassie: (Laughs)",
        "Sebastian: We'll do it. All right, I know you have to get going, so...",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I'll walk you out.",
        "Sebastian: Okay.",
        "Cassie: See you later, sweetie.",
        "Sebastian: See you later, alligator. Do you mind if I stick around for a little bit and look around? I'd really like to see the place.",
        "Cassie: Sure. Be my guest.",
        "Sebastian: Thanks. It's really nice to meet you, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: You, too.",
        "Sebastian: Hey, promise me that you will take care of yourself and RJ, okay?",
        "Cassie: I will.",
        "Sebastian: Okay. (Car door shuts) (car drives off) RJ. I think I forgot my car keys.",
        "RJ: You have a funny name.",
        "Sebastian: (Laughs) you think? Sebastian. It's Latin. It means venerable. That means people should respect me.",
        "RJ: Just because of your name?",
        "Sebastian: Well, it comes from a very great roman warrior who lived about 2,000 years ago, Sebastianus. And his own men shot him with a bunch of arrows. Did anyone ever tell about your Granddad Roger, the guy that you're named after? No? Well, he was a very great man too, and he was powerful and brave, and just like Sebastianus, all of the people in this town shot him with many, many arrows. Yeah, and he told me all about them. And I didn't know your Granddad Roger until I was all grown up. But I'm going to make sure, RJ, that you remember him always. That's why I'm here, you know. Well, that's why he sent me. Part of the reason, anyway. I'm also here to claim my birthright... and yours. And who knows? Maybe I'll get a little revenge while I'm at it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Well, honestly I didn't know what it would feel like to be connected to people. But having that memory of my mom, just makes me wonder about my other relationships, you know, like my dad and my brother and Bill.",
        "Tony: Danny, it's okay, honestly, it's okay. You guys were married, you know. And I think that getting your memory back with him and all the good things you guys shared would make it easier, right? Maybe a little better for you, right?",
        "Michelle: Except I'm a little bit scared, you know, because every little bit of memory that I gain, I'm afraid I might lose a bit of who I fought so hard to be since this explosion.",
        "Tony: Well, don't. I'm serious. Don't. You hang on to every single good memory that you have, you know, even if you and Danny don't... whatever it is, just... I don't know. You know, I look at the person now, right now in front of me and I see the most amazing person that I've ever known. Okay. And I want you to hold to that. Okay? Huh?",
        "Michelle: I will.",
        "Tony: Yeah?",
        "Michelle: I promise.",
        "Tony: Good.",

        "Tammy: Let's go get something to drink. Do you want anything?",
        "Reva: No, thanks, Tammy.",
        "JB: No hard feelings. I didn't mean to get you riled up.",
        "Tammy: Hey, this is a hard time for everyone. Come on.",
        "JB: Take care, Reva. I'm sorry about that.",
        "Tammy: Oh, it's not your fault. My family, they just don't get you.",
        "JB: Yeah, well, I guess I don't help with that, either. It's just that Reva reminds me of my Mom.",
        "Tammy: And you two don't get along?",
        "JB: You could say that.",
        "Tammy: I'm sorry.",
        "JB: Oh, don't sweat it. It's not your fault if she's a selfish excuse for a mother who doesn't care about anyone but herself. Anyway, I'll... I'll try harder with your aunt next time.",
        "Tammy: Thanks. And thanks for being here.",
        "JB: Oh, sure. That's just the kind of guy I am, a real prince.",
        "Banker: Mrs. Lewis?",
        "Reva: Mr. Duncan. You didn't have to come down here.",
        "Banker: I know. But I'm sorry to bother you here, but I got your message and I wanted to see you this time.",
        "Reva: This time?",
        "Banker: Well, I spoke to your husband on the phone, didn't you?",
        "Reva: No",
        "Banker: It was to check before we did release your son's inheritance to the boy that was claiming to be your son. He didn't even sign the final documents.",
        "Reva: He didn't?",
        "Banker: No. And even if he tried, we had already caught the signature discrepancy.",
        "Reva: Signature discrepancy? And you spoke to my husband about this?",
        "Banker: Yes. I think. There was a party going on. You picked up the extension, remember?",
        "Reva: Hello, hello? Is someone on the line?",
        "Sandy: Reva, it's me. I'll be done in a second.",
        "Reva: Oh, no rush. I was just trying to call Cassie. Bye-bye.",
        "Banker: Mrs. Lewis.",
        "Reva: Mr. Duncan, I'm really not feeling very well right now.",
        "Banker: We'll talk another time. Feel better soon.",
        "Reva: Thanks.",
        "Banker: All right.",

        "Cassie: What are you doing out here? You should be in bed, Reva.",
        "Reva: Cassie, oh, my God.",
        "Cassie: What? What is it?",
        "Reva: Sandy knew that he wasn't my son. He's known it all along.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "RJ: Can I be a warrior, too?",
        "Sebastian: Well, I don't know. Maybe. Come here, RJ. Have you ever seen a coin that kind of looks like this, that maybe your daddy had? He would have probably put it in a very special place.",
        "RJ: He had a hiding spot.",
        "Sebastian: Really? How do you know?",
        "RJ: My friend, Dinah, told me.",
        "Sebastian: Dinah? Show me. In here? Really? Hm. Can you take that? Okay. Yes. Yes. RJ, we have just struck gold. I'll tell you what. Do you really want to be a great warrior? Okay. Then you need to take the great warrior test, all right? Great warriors know how to keep secrets. Do you know how to keep a secret? You do? Good. And this is going to be our little secret.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You said yourself that Sandy's been jumpy, that he seemed upset about something. This is the reason.",
        "Reva: Yeah, I thought so, too, but it just doesn't make sense. I mean, why would he come to town in the first place?",
        "Cassie: For the money.",
        "Reva: No, Cassie. He had so many opportunities to claim Jonathan's trust fund and he never did. He didn't want to.",
        "Cassie: Okay, well, maybe the lies are catching up with him. Think back to that night you caught him in Josh's office; the night he told you he was your son. What happened?",
        "Reva: He had Jonathan's account pulled up on the computer, and he was stealing from the safe.",
        "Cassie: Exactly. If you hadn't caught him, he'd be long gone by now.",
        "Reva: I don't know if I can believe it. I mean, the feelings all seem so real, and he never wanted to tell me he was Jonathan to begin with. I had to drag that out of him. But maybe that was all a part of the plan. It's just... when I look at him, I mean, the feelings are still...",
        "Cassie: Reva. You know, I hate to bring this up, but do you remember when I caught him watching tapes of Richard?",
        "Reva: You thought that he was missing his father. I mean, we both did.",
        "Cassie: He was doing his homework.",
        "Reva: And we were filling in the blanks.",
        "Cassie: I took him to Richard's grave. You showed him photo albums. We coached him to be Jonathan.",
        "Reva: I've got to know the truth. His computer.",
        "Cassie: What about it?",
        "Reva: He kept slamming his computer shut every time I came around, and he was acting very suspicious.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Let's go get it. Where is it?",
        "Reva: Probably at the house.",
        "Cassie: All right. I'll tell Tammy to get it. I'll be back. Tammy, can I talk to you, please? I need you to go to Josh and Reva's and get Sandy's computer, okay?",
        "Tammy: Okay, yeah. Why? What's going on?",
        "Cassie: Nothing. Reva just needs to look at it. The key is under the planter out back, all right?",
        "Tammy: Oh, I have mine.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Thanks.",
        "Tammy: Well, I have to go to my Aunt Reva's house. I really hate leaving here right now, though.",
        "JB: Then stay. I'll go.",
        "Tammy: You really don't mind?",
        "JB: Yeah, no problem. It's just a laptop. I'll find it.",

        "JB: I don't?",
        "Sandy: You never wanted this family. You threw it away like trash.",
        "JB: It was my trash to throw away, and now I want it back. And besides, blood is thicker than shared livers.",
        "Sandy: No.",
        "JB: No?",
        "Sandy: It's too late.",
        "JB: Why? Why? Why? Because you're the hero son who saved your cousin from getting hit by that car? Did you ever think you were supposed to get hit by that car?",
        "Sandy: It was you?",
        "JB: Yeah. Somebody had to put an end to your long lost lamb days. And all that lovey-dovey crap that you were pulling with my mom? Starting to make me sick.",
        "Sandy: I must tell her.",
        "JB: Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. It's too late. I'm going to pull the plug on you, but first I want to take you somewhere.",

        "Dinah: I wasn't blabbing anything.",
        "Edmund: Oh, you would have, if I hadn't stopped you.",
        "Dinah: Would you just leave me alone?",
        "Edmund: What were you thinking?! Do you have any idea what could have happened to you in there?",
        "Dinah: (Laughs) okay, let me see. Do you know that I was raised by a traveling freak show? I've been banished from a country. I've been in prison. Haven't been able to see my family. And, oh yeah, your crazy girlfriend tried to kill me. So what else is going to happen, sir? What did you think was going to happen in there? What are you afraid of? What, you think I was going to, like, spill a drink on my very expensive blouse or something? What were you afraid of? Why don't you tell me? You know what? Don't worry. You don't need to tell me anything because I know what you are afraid of. You are afraid I was going to spill the beans on your sweet, yet demented, Cassie. Your secret is safe with me, okay? My lips are sealed. I'm just a secret depository.",
        "Edmund: Stop it, all right? That's enough. Stop it.",
        "Dinah: Teach me.",
        "Edmund: Teach you what?",
        "Dinah: Teach me. Teach me how you did it.",
        "Edmund: How I did what?",
        "Dinah: You were the town pariah. Now everybody loves you.",
        "Edmund: (Scoffs) hardly.",
        "Dinah: You did horrible, despicable things, worse than me, to Cassie and her sister. And now you're engaged to be married. You're buddy-buddy with Reva, and you've got a long list, I know, and I know you've wronged a lot of people. But you're a good guy, Edmund, and you just got the world by its tail, a new lease on life.",
        "Edmund: Well, I guess you're forgetting about my little meeting with Jeffrey in the barn.",
        "Dinah: A momentary lapse, that's not a big thing.",
        "Edmund: Well, remind me to remind you of that next time you try to blackmail me.",
        "Dinah: I just want to know how you did it. What's your secret? I mean, what do I got to do? Do I just stay invisible? Do I become the Mother Teresa of Springfield? Do I save trees, raise orphans? What do I do? Because I don't... (sobs) this anger is hurting so bad inside of me, and I don't have any place to go. Except for this lousy bar.",
        "Edmund: Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey, um... (keys jingling) take these. They're keys to my apartment at Towers. You can stay there until you pull yourself together. (Shuffling money) take that, and take a cab.",
        "Dinah: Why are you doing all this?",
        "Edmund: I guess I'm just trying to give you the same thing that was given me. Hey, hey, hey, hey. If you're... if you're serious about changing, you've got to believe in the person you think... look, just... no one's going to find anything redeeming in you until you see it in yourself first.

        "JB: What do you think?",
        "Sandy: I tried to save you. I grabbed your hand.",
        "JB: But did you hold on as long as you could? Could you have held on a little longer? Maybe put a little more effort into pulling me back up? See, you don't know, do you? You don't know if you let your old pal fall off the face of the earth. I'm thinking you didn't look very long and you told no one. Because it was okay, me being gone, wasn't it?",
        "Sandy: Maybe it was. Maybe I was sick of the way you treated me, the way you treat everyone.",
        "JB: Oh, boo-hoo. Still the coward. Although I got to give you credit, you came to Springfield and made everyone believe you were me.",
        "Sandy: I came to Springfield to tell everyone about you.",
        "JB: But you didn't try hard enough. Oh, man, this is starting to sound very familiar. You just love being Jonathan, being Reva's son, don't you?",
        "Sandy: Yes.",
        "JB: And Mom accepted you like one of her own brood. Reva's the best, isn't she?",
        "Sandy: Yes, she is.",
        "JB: What she did is unforgivable. Not recognizing her own son, sticking with you through this. She can't get away with this, can she?",

        "Tony: Well, if he's smart, he will. Hm? I saw this picture... oh, there it is, right there. You and your family, right?",

You.... you told me that it was innocent, but I knew better. She was stripping and supposedly pulling her life together, and you rescued her. And just like you, Edmund never saw it coming. I got to him. I got to him the way that Cassie got to you. Oh, Hart, I mean, I saw it in his eyes. And he even gave me the keys to his apartment. He swore to me that she... that she was innocent and that she didn't plan it, but I did, and it worked. It worked. So I'm not going to leave anything to chance, not anymore. No. I want to see how she likes it.",

His father and I believed he was traveling in Europe, but his last known sighting as on a hiking trip near Sion. We've come to believe there may have been an accident. Have you discovered the body of a John Doe meeting this description? My son had a ying-yang tattoo on his upper back.\" Oh, my God. Jonathan's dead. And you knew, Sandy. You knew it all along.",
