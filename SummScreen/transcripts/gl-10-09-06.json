        "Ava: Olivia, I don't think you should be anywhere around here. I can't \r\npromise you what Coop's going to do. ",
        "Olivia: I'm not worried about Coop. We have to talk. There are things that \r\nyou need to hear. ",

        "Ashlee: Here you go. ",
        "Dinah: Thank you. ",
        "Ashlee: Oh, is that \"Springfield Burns\"? I love gossip. ",
        "Dinah: Well, you live in the right town. ",
        "Ashlee: Isn't that...? ",
        "Dinah: Yep. ",
        "Ashlee: But isn't he with...? ",
        "Dinah: Yeah. ",
        "Ashlee: But...? ",
        "Dinah: Yeah. ",
        "Ashlee: What...? ",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Well, you know what? I think it's going to be interesting to see \r\nwhat happens to these two. ",
        "Marina: Very funny, guys, very funny. Yeah, someone sent me this link in my \r\ne-mail. ",
        "Mallet: What did I miss? What's going on? ",
        "",
        "Lizzie: Mom, you and Uncle Rick? ",
        "Beth: No, no, of course not. This is Jonathan. You can't believe anything \r\nthat he says. Alan, I can explain this. ",
        "Alan: Excuse me. ",
        "Beth: Alan. ",
        "Mel: Is it true? Is it true? ",
        "Rick: Mel... my wife never did anything to you. You're going to pay for this!\r\n",
        "Jonathan: Okay. Whatever. So much for the perfect family, huh? ",
        "Tammy: Are you okay? ",
        "Remy: I'm going to go check on Mel. ",
        "Jonathan: That had to be done. ",
        "Tammy: Why? To get back at Beth and Alan? ",
        "Jonathan: No. Now you can see that they're no better than us. ",
        "Tammy: Jonathan, you didn't do this to hurt Alan. You hurt all of these \r\npeople because you thought you were losing me. ",
        "",
        "Olivia: Look, I know we've been through a lot in the past... ",
        "Ava: Just stop, okay? I know what you're going to say. ",
        "Olivia: I don't think you do. ",
        "Ava: Let me guess. I haven't been myself lately because my little girl, she's \r\nbeen sick. And if you really cared about Emma, then you wouldn't take her mommy \r\naway from her. ",
        "Olivia: Are you done? ",
        "Ava: Do you know why I know what you're going to say to me? ",
        "Olivia: I don't care about that. ",
        "Ava: You should care about that. I stopped giving a damn about you a long \r\ntime ago. I am so conflicted about you leaving me to die in that fire that I \r\nhave completely excused everything that you've done to me after that. Do you \r\nrealize what you've done to me, Olivia? ",
        "Olivia: Please, just... ",
        "Ava: You tried to push me off the balcony at Towers, you tried to mow me over \r\nwith a car. When that didn't work, you hired somebody to try to take me out. Out \r\nof everybody that I've met in my entire life, I have never met anyone like you.\r\n",
        "Olivia: I imagine that's true. So what about your life? ",
        "Ava: What? ",
        "Olivia: Tell me about your life. I want to understand you. ",
        "Ava: Why do you care? I don't know what this is about. I don't care actually \r\nwhat this is about. I'm going to finely make you pay for what you've done to me.\r\n",
        "Olivia: You say that. You said that last night and you said it just now, but \r\nyou haven't gone to the police. ",
        "Ava: No, I haven't because I have something much different in mind for you.\r\n",
        "",
        "Mallet: Why do I feel like a substitute teacher walking into the classroom?\r\n",
        "Marina: What's with the cameras? ",
        "Mallet: Oh, you know my episode of \"The Law\"? It did really well, so they're \r\nthinking about giving me my own show. ",
        "Marina: Great. ",
        "Mallet: Guys, you can take five. Thanks. You know, it's never a good sign \r\nwhen you walk into a room and everybody stops laughing. ",
        "Marina: It's nothing. ",
        "Mallet: What? \"Mallet and Marina: Does Mallet want to crack the case or crack \r\nMarina's panties?\" That's great. That's great. You've got to love this blogger. \r\nHey, guys, show's over. ",
        "Marina: They are children. ",
        "Mallet: Well, I didn't see you here before. ",
        "Dinah: I didn't know if this was still your desk or if, you know, your new \r\ngirlfriend and you are sharing one now. ",
        "",
        "Beth: We need to discuss what happened tonight, Alan. ( Verdi's \"La Traviata\" \r\nplaying) ",
        "Alan: \"La Traviata.\" One of my favorite Verdi operas. You know what the \r\ntranslation of \"La Traviata\" is, Beth? ",
        "Beth: No, no, I don\u2019t. ",
        "Alan: \"The woman who strayed.\" Brandy? ",
        "Beth: What are you going to do to me, Alan? ",
        "",
        "Mel: Just leave me alone! ",
        "Rick: Stop, please. You almost crashed the car three times on the way home. \r\nWould you just give me a chance to explain? ",
        "Mel: Explain?! Explain what? We all saw it. You did not deny it. What do you \r\nwant to explain? As if the damage wasn't bad enough, as if me being humiliated \r\nin front of those people was not bad enough, now you want to explain, like I'm \r\ntoo stupid to know what's going on. Or maybe there's an excuse. ",
        "Rick: There is no excuse. ",
        "Mel:, Well, then, we're done. Let go of me. ",
        "Rick: Don't say that. Don't say it, please. ",
        "Mel: God. Beth? It had to be her, right? Just when I thought we were on our \r\nway back to something good, just when I thought it was something I never \r\ndoubted. ",
        "Rick: It didn't seem that way to me. ",
        "Mel: You know, I had trouble with what you did with Phillip. But I was \r\ngetting over it, and I never gave up on our marriage. ",
        "Rick: Our marriage felt like it was dead. ",
        "Mel: But it wasn\u2019t. It wasn't, we were getting better. ",
        "Rick: Yes, lately Mel, we've been... but for the last couple of years you \r\nwouldn't touch me. You wouldn't even look me in the eye. You wouldn't even talk \r\nto me. ",
        "Mel: Oh, you were an ass and now it's my fault? ",
        "Rick: No, it's not your fault. ",
        "Mel: You know, I found a key card in your pocket when I was trying to put a \r\nlove note in your pocket, and I pushed down the questions. I just tried to \r\nignore it. ",
        "Rick: You kick me out of our bed. I thought our marriage was over. ",
        "Mel: Oh, really. And what did you feel, alone? ",
        "Rick: Yes, I felt alone. So I turned to an old friend for comfort. ",
        "Mel: Oh, comfort. ",
        "Rick: It was a mistake and I was wrong, and I wanted to stop it. ",
        "Mel: How long? It was obviously not one time. How long? ",
        "Rick: No, it wasn't one time. ",
        "Mel: It was a full-blown affair, you son of a bitch! ",
        "",
        "Tammy: You can tell me the truth, Jonathan. Why did you announce this secret \r\ntonight? ",
        "Jonathan: What do you want me to say, Tammy, I did it to prove a point? I \r\ndid. ",
        "Tammy: What point? ",
        "Jonathan: That people have things underneath the surface, and when you're \r\nsweet and trusting like you are, people take advantage of that. ",
        "Tammy: Jealousy, payback. You crushed Remy\u2019s family to get back at him for \r\nspending time with me? ",
        "Jonathan: Remy\u2019s... I'm sick of him always being around you. I'm sick of him \r\nalways getting to be there to say the perfect thing to you. I am sick of him \r\nholding his family over us like they're so fantastic, and they do awful things \r\njust like everybody else? Tammy, come on. He is one of those hypocrites, one of \r\nthose people who wanted --who never wanted us to be together in the first place.\r\n",
        "Tammy: Mel was destroyed tonight and she helped us. She helped you. Where did \r\nyou even get that photo? ",
        "Jonathan: I caught Beth and Rick before the trial. I just kept it in case we \r\nlost. ",
        "Tammy: Well, we didn\u2019t. And you know what? I like Remy\u2019s family. I have known \r\nthem for longer than I've known you, and they have always been there for me. \r\nThey were there for me when I needed them, and you want to punish them for that?\r\n",
        "Jonathan: They're pulling you away from me. You don't need them. We need each \r\nother, okay? Not that... ",
        "Tammy: Hey! Hey, you guys, stop it! Stop. Stop it. Jonathan, stop it! Stop \r\nit, stop it! ",

        "Olivia: Hold up. Wait, wait before you start... ",
        "Ava: Stop it. ",
        "Olivia: ...With all the threats. ",
        "Ava: You are going to turn yourself in. ",
        "Olivia: I'm sorry, what was that? ",
        "Ava: Either you go down to the station and you admit to everything that \r\nyou've done or I will. It's the right thing to do. ",
        "Olivia: For who? For you? So you don't have to watch Emma grow up knowing \r\nthat you're the one who put her mother in jail for the next 20 years? ",
        "Ava: If I take you down there, you are going to get a long, long prison \r\nsentence but if you go down there and confess, maybe they'll have a little mercy \r\non you. ",
        "Olivia: Oh my gosh. You don't have to press charges. ",
        "Ava: So, what, you can come after me again? ",
        "Olivia: I'm not going to come after you. ",
        "Ava: I don't believe that. I feel sorry for Emma. I really do. I lost my \r\nmother when I was a kid. I would never wish that on anyone, even if you are her \r\nmother. ",
        "Olivia: Please don't say that. ",
        "Ava: She doesn't deserve to suffer, but you do, and you will. ",

        "Marina: Very mature. I'm glad to know that our streets are being protected by \r\na bunch of six year olds. ( Laughter ) When I find this blogger, I'm taking off \r\nthe badge for five minutes. ",
        "",
        "Dinah: I hear that she is a detective in training. You're just the guy to \r\nbreak her in, aren't you? ",
        "Mallet: Stop. ",
        "Dinah: Do you get kinky with your handcuffs? ",
        "Mallet: Okay, enough. Stop. ",
        "Dinah: Now, you were a warden. I mean, do you guys lock each other up in your \r\nprison of love? ",
        "Mallet: I don't even know what that last one means. And now, it is time for \r\nyou to go. ",
        "Dinah: Was Chicago all work and no play? ",
        "Mallet: Do you believe everything you read online? ",
        "Dinah: Well, I already knew Harley and Gus stopped by to take a statement \r\nabout the break-in. ",
        "Mallet: No, Harley and Gus would never spill anything like that, to anyone.\r\n",
        "Dinah: Oh, really, is that a police thing? A silence code thing? ",
        "Mallet: Yeah, yeah exactly. You know what? Maybe you found out about the trip \r\nand then you tipped off the blogger. No, no, no, you know what? Maybe you are \r\nthe blogger and maybe it's time we went in that other room and had a little Q&A, \r\nright? Maybe said it out loud, a little interrogation? What do you think? ",
        "Dinah: No. ",
        "Mallet: Got something to tell me? ",
        "Dinah: No, I have nothing to tell you because your accusations and your \r\napparent lack of trust is reminding me why I dumped your butt. ",
        "Mallet: I dumped you. And it's a nice butt. ",
        "",
        "Alan: You're my wife, Beth, I'm not going to hurt you. ",
        "Beth: You haven't said a word about what happened tonight. ",
        "Alan: Look, let's not pretend that our marriage started with love. It didn\u2019t. \r\nIt was a business arrangement that you and I both agreed upon. But you know \r\nsomething, Beth? I thought that our relationship was really moving toward a real \r\nmarriage. ",
        "Beth: Alan, what happened with Rick, I needed it. I had just lost the baby. I \r\njust found out that Phillip was alive, that you had kept it from me even while \r\nwe were creating that baby. I was angry at you, and Rick... Rick reminded me of \r\na time when I felt good and whole. ",
        "Alan: Really? When was that? ",
        "Beth: When Mindy and Rick and Phillip and I were together. ",
        "Alan: Reality check, Beth. That was then. This is now. Because when you \r\nbecame Mrs. Alan Spaulding, you gave that part of yourself up for power and \r\nmoney. That's the deal you made with your soul. ",
        "Beth: Alan, that is still in me. That's still... it's still a part of me. ",
        "Alan: Really? You want to go back being the old Beth, the weak Beth, \r\npowerless, the one at the mercy of others? Really? Well, if that is what will \r\nmake you feel whole, be my guest. Go out the door and be with Rick Bauer. But \r\nyou will leave penniless and with only the clothes on your back. Only I'm not \r\ngoing to stop you. ",
        "Beth: And what if I want to stay? ",
        "Alan: Then go upstairs and think about our wedding vows. Specifically the one \r\nthat says \"Till death do we part.\" ",
        "",
        "Rick: We had some great memories out here. ",
        "Mel: You know, I... I can't even remember a single one. ",
        "Rick: Sweetheart, I can't tell you how ashamed I am of what I did and how \r\nsorry I am. ",
        "Mel: Well, if I forgive you right now, would you leave? Or would you force \r\nyour way into my life whether I like it or not? ",
        "Rick: Mel, we have a daughter together. ",
        "Mel: Well, she's always been daddy's little girl, so I'm sure she'll forgive \r\nyou. ",
        "Rick: So we just can't save our marriage, is that what you're saying? ",
        "Mel: How can we save our marriage? When the past-- your friendship with \r\nPhillip, the four musketeers, Beth-- they all mean more to you than me. ",
        "Rick: That is not true! ",
        "Mel: Then why did you sleep with her? ",
        "Rick: I already told you! That answer's not going to change. But I can. I can \r\nbe better than that. Mel, I love you. ",
        "Mel: Stop it. ",
        "Rick: I love you and I know that you love me in spite of what I just did to \r\nyou. All I'm asking... all I'm asking is for you to believe in us one last time \r\nand I swear to you, I will never let you down again. ",

        "Jonathan: Hey, he wants to be more than your friend, Tammy. Can you not see \r\nthat? ",
        "Tammy: So what? I don\u2019t. I was just happy to have somebody care enough to \r\npick me up off the floor when I was so depressed to not be with you. ",
        "Jonathan: I'm sorry, but you know me. You know why I went crazy. I thought I \r\nwas going to lose you. ",

        "Beth: Good. Disrespecting me is part and parcel of the way you live your \r\nlife, Alan. You don't even know you do it. When you do show me respect, or \r\napproval, or affection, it's more like for a dog who's just done a trick. It's \r\nnot for your wife. ",
        "Alan: And your point would be, Beth? ",
        "Beth: My point is that my affair with Rick, this whole pathetic train wreck \r\nyou call a life, didn't just happen, and you know that. You know in that cramped \r\nairless box you call a soul that you created all of this. ",
        "Alan: Yeah, that's right. I bring it on myself. How many times have I heard \r\nthat refrain? ",
        "Beth: And you know what the funny thing is, Alan? With all of your power and \r\nall your money, you don't know how to fix it. You want to be loved but you don't \r\nknow how to give love. So you thrash around like a fish on a hook, so convinced \r\nof your own superiority that you don't do anything about it. ",

        "Beth: No, I will... I will, damn it, be heard. You drove me to that affair. \r\nYou drove Lizzie out of this house, and you drove Phillip to madness. You ruin \r\neverything you touch. ",
        "Alan: Enough. I've had enough of this. Go up and tell Hilda to make up the \r\nspare room if you decide to stay. If not, go out. Find yourself. You know, Beth, \r\nyou really are a broken person. Count yourself lucky that I'm here to pick up \r\nthe pieces. ",
