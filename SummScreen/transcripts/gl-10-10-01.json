        "Edmund: Get back on that elevator now.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Lorelei: Why?\u00a0\r\n",
        "Edmund: We are not staying in this hotel. Beth frequented this hotel \r\nbefore we were married, and I have stayed here since. We'll be recognize\u00a0\r\n",

        "Edmund: Haven't you.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Lorelei: Well, yes, I have, and that's exactly what I'm going to do. We \r\ncan't go back to the Springfield Inn because old Felix might show up again.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Edmund: Phillip!\u00a0\r\n",
        "Lorelei: And there's now way I'm staying at any of them dives you've been \r\ndragging me around to all morning. This is it, Eddie. I'm parking it here.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Edmund: You're the most excruciatingly difficult woman that I've... All \r\nright. All right. Never mind. We will stay at the towers under the condition \r\nthat you will remain disguised at all times, you speak to no one, and you \r\ndedicate yourself exclusively to your studies.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Lorelei: Excuse me. Last time you quizzed me, did I or did I not ace \r\nevery\u00a0question?\u00a0\r\n",
        "Edmund: With the exception of your ex-husband's name. And on other \r\nnames and faces, you were hesitant. That's why you have to keep on drilling, \r\nLorelei. When you bump into Beth's family and friends, you have to recognize \r\nthem immediately.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Lorelei: Yes, sir.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Edmund: Good. I'll go check in. In the meantime, you sit in this \r\ncorner, you face the wall. Do you have that crib sheet I made up for you?\u00a0\r\n",
        "Lorelei: Yeah, I got it.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Edmund: Good.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Lorelei: I got it. It's right...\u00a0\r\n",
        "Edmund: Study it.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Lorelei: Oh, I'll study it, darling. But I won't follow all your \r\norders.\u00a0\r\nMmm. Hey.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n",
        "Bartender: Hello. What can I do for you, ma'am?\u00a0\r\n",

        "Bartender: You got it.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Lorelei: That's my mama, Lillian. And that's my rich ex. Why can't I \r\nremember your name, sugar? You sure are a good-looking thing too.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Bartender: There you go: A pink lady for the pretty lady.\u00a0\r\n",

        "Messenger: Where should I put this?\u00a0\r\n",
        "Reva: There is fine, but are you sure that this is for me? Because I \r\ndidn't\u00a0\r\nreally order anything that... Hello? Hello? \"Daphne Delroy, Mandrake inn.\u00a0\r\nReturn to sender, address unknown\"? Oh. No, no, no, no, no. No, this can't\u00a0\r\nbe. Please tell me that this is not...

        "Mel: Okay, I guess there's no way to avoid this. We can talk, but not \r\nhere.\u00a0\r\n",

        "Gus: Good. How you doing there, papa doc?\u00a0\r\n",
        "Rick: Papa doc was a Haitian dictator.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Gus: Yeah, I know that. Speak to mama Harley, huh? Has she borne the \r\nfruit of your union yet? She have the baby?\u00a0\r\n",
        "Rick: Not yet.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Gus: Oh. Wow, she must be ready to pop. Is she still out in California?\u00a0\r\n",
        "Rick: No, she's actually making her way back to Springfield.\u00a0\r\n",

        "Rick: She's driving.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Gus: Driving? What, is she mad? She's in that much of a hurry to get\u00a0\r\nback to Springfield? For what? You? You two are going to be an item, aren't\u00a0\r\nyou? You know, at the end of the day, I just... I just never thought that you \r\nwere her type.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Waitress: Would you like some coffee?\u00a0\r\n",
        "Gus: Thank you. Yes, that'd be great. That's lovely. Thank you. You can \r\nput it on his Bill, too, when you're done. He's being so nice to me.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Rick: Did you know that he's the most unpleasant person that you'll \r\never meet?\u00a0\r\n",
        "Waitress: More coffee, Dr. Bauer?\u00a0\r\n",
        "Rick: Please, that would be great, actually.\u00a0\r\n",

        "Gus: Sorry. I'm sorry, no.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Rick: No, it's not your fault. It's not your fault. It's not... Would \r\nyou please latch onto another table and leave me alone?\u00a0\r\n",
        "Gus: Excuse me for living. I just got here, okay? It was a mistake.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n",
        "Harley: Okay. Okay. I admit it, okay? I was going slightly over the \r\nposted speed limit.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Deputy: Slightly? Last time I saw speeds that high was at Daytona.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Harley: Whatever.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Deputy: Hairbrush...\u00a0\r\n",
        "Harley: Look, why don't you just fine me so I can be on my way?\u00a0\r\n",
        "Deputy: ...Cell phone...\u00a0\r\n",

        "Deputy: Are you trying to bribe me?\u00a0\r\n",
        "Harley: Well, if I were, would I admit it? No, really, look in my \r\nwallet. My ID's in there.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Deputy: I already saw your ID.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Harley: But you didn't see my badge, huh? That's right, I'm a cop. See,\u00a0\r\nand I wasn't going to say anything because I thought you were just going to\u00a0\r\nticket me, and frankly I don't like to interfere with a fellow officer doing \r\ntheir job, but now that you have collared me and dragged me in here...\u00a0\r\n",
        "Deputy: Collared you? That's a good one. Where'd you pick that one up, \r\nsome TV show?\u00a0\r\n",
        "Harley: Look, just check the pocket. Ta-da. See? Detective Harley \r\nCooper. Thank you.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Deputy: I have seen better fakes than this at the five and dime.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Harley: That is not a fake. I am a detective with the Springfield \r\nPolice\u00a0Department.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Deputy: Oh, yeah. And how do you capture the bad guys, huh? You sit \r\non them?\u00a0\r\n",
        "Harley: I happen to be on maternity leave.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Deputy: Impersonating an officer is a serious charge, lady. You are in \r\ndeep trouble now. Step inside.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Harley: Will you just listen to me?\u00a0\r\n",
        "Deputy: Inside!\u00a0\r\n",
        "Harley: This is insane.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Deputy: I know. And you're innocent, right? I've heard it all before.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Harley: I am a cop, okay? I am, I'm a cop. And the only reason that I \r\nwas\u00a0\r\nspeeding is because, in case you hadn't noticed, I'm about to have this baby \r\nany second, and I am trying to get home to Springfield before that happens.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Deputy: Lady, lady, I've only got one thing to say to you. Tell it to the \r\njudge.",
        "Harley: Hey, hey, I am telling the truth. Look, call the Springfield \r\npolice\u00a0\r\ndepartment, they'll back me up. Or better yet, I'll do it. Hey, I'm allowed one \r\nphone call, right? That is the law.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Deputy: One local call.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Harley: Fine, whatever. You know, we'll use my cell phone. That way it \r\nwon't cost you one lousy dime. Okay, hand it over.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Deputy: What, so you can use it as a weapon on me? What, do you think \r\nI'm stupid?\u00a0\r\n",
        "Harley: You know, then you call, okay? Go on. Go ahead. Pick it up. \r\nIt's\u00a0on auto dial. Just press +4 and send.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Deputy: You know, this is a cute little critter. I've never seen one \r\nthis small before.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Harley: You can play with it later, okay? Just make the damn call. Of all \r\nthe hick towns and the hick cops, I had to pick this guy to...\u00a0\r\n",
        "Alonzo: All right, so just when we finally get this big fish aboard, \r\nthis\u00a0\r\nhuge wave comes crashing over the rail and just washes him right back out to \r\nsea. You know, after that, we figured he just wasn't meant to be caught.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Patron: Last night you were really down, Alonzo. It's good to see you \r\nback to your old self.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Alonzo: It feels good too. Let me get another one of those. Today's \r\npaper?\u00a0\r\n",
        "Patron: Mm-hmm.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Bartender: You... Thought you were shipping out. What happened? What \r\nchanged your mind?\u00a0\r\n",
        "Alonzo: Nothing changed my mind. I'm still leaving.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Patron: Hey, Alonzo, game of darts?\u00a0\r\n",
        "Alonzo: Yeah, why not? As long as you're prepared to lose.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n",
        "Cassie: You don't think that we pressured Alonzo into giving us will, \r\ndo you?\u00a0\r\n",
        "Richard: What? Of course not. You were there. He made his choice quite \r\nwillingly.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Cassie: I know it seams like that, but you know, he came to the palace \r\nand\u00a0\r\nhe met the president... I mean, that had to be intimidating. How... I mean, do \r\nyou think that affected his judgment?\u00a0\r\n",
        "Richard: Darling, from what I saw of Mr. Alonzo Baptiste, the man could \r\nstare down a shark. I don't think he was intimidated.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Cassie: I just want to make sure he gave us will on his own; that, you \r\nknow, he had a choice.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Richard: He made his choice, darling, quite willingly, and he made the \r\nright one.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Cassie: In a matter of two days, he found out that his wife was \r\ndivorcing\u00a0\r\nhim, that he had his son, that his son was being adopted. I mean, under those \r\ncircumstances, I don't know if you can make the right choice.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Richard: Are you having second thoughts?\u00a0\r\n",
        "Cassie: About taking will?\u00a0\r\n",
        "Richard: Yes.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Cassie: No. God, no. I love him so much, like he were my own. \r\nJust... I just don't want to feel like we railroaded him into this.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Richard: We didn't.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Cassie: You know, you're the president, I'm the first lady, so what? \r\nThat\u00a0\r\ndoesn't mean we have a right to take someone else's child.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n",

        "Edmund: Josephine. Well. Mr. Spaulding. Mr. Alan Spaulding, how \r\nunpleasant to run into you.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Alan: I assure you the feelings are mutual, Edmund.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Edmund: Come along, Josephine. This gentleman is not worthy of your\u00a0\r\nattentions. You just had to disobey me, didn't you? Do you know what that \r\nalmost got us into?\u00a0\r\n",
        "Lorelei: Oh, get down off your high horse. There's no harm done.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Edmund: Lorelei, that man was once your father-in-law. It's incredible \r\nhe\u00a0\r\ndidn't recognize you as it was. But if you had taken off your sunglasses, in \r\nthat one capricious act you would have ruined everything.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Lorelei: And everything would be what, exactly?\u00a0\r\n",
        "Edmund: Excuse me?\u00a0\r\n",
        "Lorelei: I want to know what the stakes are, Eddie, in U.S. Dollars and\u00a0\r\ncents. You stop being so vague with me on the money count, and maybe I'll \r\nstart following orders.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Edmund: Well, I have figures for you, but they're so large I don't \r\nthink you could comprehend them.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Lorelei: Try me. Well, go on. I'll be a Princess and wear a tiara and \r\norder people around; that much I got. But how much is it worth?\u00a0\r\n",
        "Edmund: All right, I'll keep this simple. Do you really like this hotel?\u00a0\r\n",
        "Lorelei: Yeah.\u00a0\r\n",

Okay, thanks.
