        "Dinah: Come on, you'll get me out of here. Edmund will do whatever you say. For once, that might work for me. Let something just work for me. Come on phone! Come on, come on. You're the only thing I've got. Come on.",
        "Edmund: And, of course, one more for the road. Good. No one will ever know this place ever existed.",
        "Dinah: Okay, okay.",
        "Edmund: Wherever Dinah is, no one will ever believe her. Ciao, Bella.",

        "Tammy: Please God. ( Sniffles ) I know I've made a terrible mistake. These thoughts I've been having and these feelings are wrong. I don't know why Sandy has to be here, why he had to get hurt, but if it's because Jonathan and I... please just... ( sniffles ) ...just have him get better. I'll do anything. Just have him be okay, and I'll never see Jonathan again. I'll never even think about him again. Just have Sandy be all right. Just have him wake up. I'm begging you. Oh, my God, Sandy. Sandy! You're back. You're back.",

        "Billy: I mean, I wined her and dined her. ( Laughter ) Spent a lot of money. But I think I asked her for her body, not her phone number. ( Laughter ) (Olivia thinking) At some point you're going to need more than a killer body and killer instincts. You'll be ready to play with the big boys someday, but that ain't today.",
        "Bill: One olive is water and two olives is vodka.",
        "Billy: Olivia. Here, amigo. ...Amigo. ( Laughter )",
        "Olivia: I know I had no business calling you, but when I saw him take a drink...",

        "Dinah: That's what I'm trying to tell you.",
        "Cassie: I trusted you, Dinah. Everyone told me I was crazy but I trusted you, and you know what? They were right.",
        "Dinah: Cassie.",
        "Cassie: It sounds crazy now but I honestly believed you had changed. Do you know that?",
        "Dinah: Would you please listen to me? I need your help.",

        "Dinah: Cassie? Cassie? Damn it. Oh, my God, no. Oh, my God. Help me. Help me, someone. Help me! Oh, God. Help me.",
        "Cassie: She hung up on me.",
        "Jonathan: Why would she hang up? Dinah's the one that called you.",
        "Cassie: Because she wants to torture me; that's why.",
        "Jonathan: You know, I don't think so.",
        "Cassie: Why not?",
        "Jonathan: Maybe she called to apologize. You know, people change.",
        "Cassie: You know what? I believed that. Dinah, Edmund.",
        "Jonathan: Me? Two minutes ago, you thanked me for staying out of the mess with little baby Hope. I mean, that's a change.",
        "Cassie: Oh, come on. That's one change. One change, you know? You're still you.",
        "Jonathan: It's a start, right?",
        "Cassie: It seems to me that you really care about what I think. Why is that?",

        "Tammy: I knew you would come back. I knew you wouldn't leave me. Rick! Look who's back!",
        "Rick: Oh, my goodness. Hey, Sandy. Hey, man, it's glad to have you back. What happened?",
        "Tammy: I was just praying and he opened his eyes.",
        "Rick: Well, that must have been one heck of a prayer, sweetheart. Listen, I'm going to need some time alone to run some tests, okay?",
        "Tammy: He's going to be fine now, right? I mean, the worst of it's over. He's awake.",
        "Rick: Just give me a couple of minutes, okay?",

        "Bill: Oh, my goodness. Tell me this is a good news hug. Is this a good news hug?",
        "Tammy: Sandy's awake.",
        "Bill: He's awake, he's awake. What happened? Tell me what happened? Did he say anything? What's going on?",
        "Tammy: No. He was unconscious like before and then he just all of a sudden opened his eyes.",
        "Bill: He was looking right at you, I bet. Is that right?",
        "Tammy: It was amazing.",
        "Bill: This is awesome. This is... oh, my gosh.",
        "Tammy: ( Laughs )",
        "Rick: All right, Sandy, I just want you to follow my finger with your eyes, okay? This is unbelievable. I love a good miracle before I go off-shift, and you are definitely a miracle. Sandy, I tell you, you had a lot of us very, very worried about you, but not Tammy. No, I mean, she was concerned, but she never lost faith in you, not for a single second. You're a very lucky man. She must really love you.",
        "Bill: So, I mean, you were there when he woke up, huh?",
        "Tammy: Yeah.",
        "Bill: Wow.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, I was praying. Well, it was more like a promise, really.",
        "Bill: Right.",
        "Tammy: I made this promise to God that if he brought Sandy back, I would...",
        "Bill: Yeah, you'd... you'd what?",
        "Tammy: Do what's right. And I'm going to keep that promise.",
        "Bill: Well, whatever it is, he kept up his end of the bargain, so I hope you stick to yours, huh?",

        "Billy: Whoa! ( Laughs ) The chair jumped in front of me. ( Laughs )",
        "Olivia: Look, I... I know this is going to sound awful, but I think maybe I should go, because it's going to be awkward if Billy...",
        "Josh: If he realizes that you're the one that got in touch with me.",
        "Billy: ( Laughs )",
        "Olivia: I'm sorry. This is just... this is going to be harder for him than I...",
        "Josh: It's okay. It's okay. Just go. It's all right, I can handle it. Olivia? Thank you.",
        "Garcia: I have to get back to the hotel.",
        "Billy: Oh, no, no, no. We're just getting started. The night's young. Come on.",

        "Edmund: Bartender. Dinah Marler. Have you seen her tonight? Oh, come on, you must know who I'm talking about. She's been coming here for months. Brunette, about yea tall, pretty, hazel eyes. Come on, high cheekbones. Athletic build, nice little... God, you're useless. Damn it!",

I mean, I nailed it just like the old days. I nailed it. I did it by myself. ( Laughs ) I'm going... I am... I'm going to go.",
        "Josh: No. You are not getting in a car, Billy. You're drunk. What were you thinking?",
        "Billy: It was vodka, but... but, I mean, I thought it was water.",

        "Billy: I thought I was... I was drinking water.",
        "Josh: Come on, Billy.",
        "Billy: I made a mistake. I mean, I had the olives, and I was taking the water. I was only drinking the water and then I just... I just... I just took a sip.",
        "Josh: Yeah, and then what happened, Billy? Did you spit it out? Did you get mad at the bartender for making a mistake? Did you say this could never happen again?",
        "Billy: No, no. I kind of thought \"what the hell?\" You know?",
        "Josh: What the hell?",
        "Billy: Yeah.",
        "Josh: Billy. 13 years of sobriety down the drain? \"What the hell\"?",

        "Josh: How many... how many drinks did you have?",
        "Billy: I was like my old self again. I had them eating out of my hand.",
        "Josh: How many drinks did you have? So what happens now?",
        "Billy: I quit.",
        "Josh: You couldn't quit earlier tonight.",
        "Billy: Yeah, well, I'm different now, Josh. I... I can do it by myself. You know I can do it. You know I can.",
        "Josh: No, I don't, Billy.",
        "Billy: Yeah.",
        "Josh: As of this moment, you are on hiatus from Lewis. I'm taking you off of Venezuela and every other project you're working on, because I can't afford to take this kind of a risk, and, more importantly, neither can you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: He's got a ways to go, but I'm cautiously optimistic.",
        "Olivia: About Sandy?",
        "Rick: Yeah, he's... he's...",
        "Tammy: He woke up.",
        "Rick: He's aware of his surroundings, he's responsive to stimuli. That's a major step forward.",
        "Tammy: I'm going back in.",
        "Rick: Tammy, he's been through hell and back, okay? Just take it easy on him.",
        "Tammy: Okay.",
        "Rick: Okay.",

        "Bill: Rick, thanks.",
        "Rick: Well, he deserves all the credit. He came back by himself. ( Pager beeps ) He's a strong kid. Excuse me.",
        "Bill: Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness. I'm so happy, I feel like celebrating.",
        "Olivia: ( Sighs ) You know what?",
        "Bill: Hm?",
        "Olivia: So do I.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, then let's get cracking. Let's go to Outskirts. Come on.",
        "Olivia: No. You know what? Let's do something better.",
        "Bill: Better?",
        "Olivia: Yeah. Come on.",
        "Bill: My, my.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I mean it, Sandy. Everything's going to be perfect just as soon as we get you out of here. Right? So I'm going to spend every minute of every day right here with you until you can climb out of this bed and walk out that door on your own two feet. We'll walk out there together right towards our new lives together. Don't talk, okay? Just save your strength. Then you can talk to me forever.",
        "Sandy: ( Tries to speak )",
        "Tammy: What's that?",
        "Sandy: Go... ...away.",

        "Jonathan: All right, uh, I'm going to get out of here.",
        "Cassie: Wait. Wait. I really would like to know why you care what I think.",
        "Jonathan: Well, I might want to hit you up for something someday, maybe some money.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Always thinking, huh?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I might be selfish but I'm not shortsighted.",
        "Cassie: I'll try and remember that. ( Car approaching ) Oh, shoot.",
        "Jonathan: What's the matter?",
        "Cassie: I'm just waiting for Mrs. Chitwood to show up. She needs to watch the kids for me so I can get down to Cedars to see how Tammy's doing. She's taking Sandy's accident really hard.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Yeah, that's a tough situation.",
        "Cassie: I know. And now I have to figure out where I'm going to get cotton candy at this time of night.",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) I've heard of people Jonesing for sugar, but cotton candy?",
        "Cassie: It's not for me; it's for Tammy. It's a comfort thing. I would give her cotton candy whenever she felt down about something, so it's... I don't know, it's turned into a tradition joke between the two of us. Whenever the cotton candy shows up, she knows that good times are right around the corner.",
        "Jonathan: Cute.",
        "Cassie: ( Laughs )",
        "Jonathan: I'd better be out of here.",
        "Cassie: Hey. It was nice talking to you in a very weird way.",

        "Cassie: Don't worry.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, hi.",
        "Cassie: Edmund, what the hell are you doing here? I thought I told you to get out.",
        "Edmund: I know, I know. I just... there were a few things I needed to pick up. Probably just some things you forgot to... or couldn't fit into my suitcases when you packed them for me.",
        "Cassie: Fine. You can get them and go.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I know you're still angry with me.",
        "Cassie: Yes, I am angry with you. Your partner in crime called, too, Dinah.",
        "Edmund: Dinah called you?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. And we had quite the little chat.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: ( Coughing )",
        "Mallet: Hello! Is anybody here! Hey. Hey. You all right? Come on, lady. Come on. I've got to get you out of here. Come on.",
        "Dinah: ( Coughing )",
        "Mallet: Dinah. Dinah.",
        "Dinah: ( Coughing )",
        "Mallet: Hey. Dinah.",
        "Dinah: ( Coughing )",
        "Mallet: Dinah, come on. Stay with me. I'm going to get you out of here.",
        "Dinah: ( Coughing ) Edmund. Edmund.",
        "Mallet: What? What did you say? Edmund? Edmund. I guess we'll talk about him later. Or not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: What did Dinah say? What lies did she tell you this time? I should have known the first thing to do would be to call you.",
        "Cassie: She didn't say anything. And I'd really like to know why you were so sure she'd call.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, you just said you had quite the little chat with her.",
        "Cassie: I lied. She hung up. Or we got cut off, I don't know, but either way, she only got three sentences out, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Oh, you know, it figures. It wasn't enough that she tormented us for nine months with our baby. She had to call to rub your nose in it. She called to gloat, Cassie. It's 100% Dinah.",
        "Cassie: That's what I thought. But one part of that doesn't really add up. Dinah asked me for help and she sounded like she really meant it.",
        "Edmund: Well, the woman's a master manipulator, Cassie. This whole mess is proof of that.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, but still, I don't know why she would be asking me for help if she was trying to kick me while I was down.",
        "Edmund: Well, who knows what lunatic ideas go through her head. So, did you find out where she was when she was calling, before you were cut off?",
        "Cassie: No.",
        "Edmund: Well, maybe she'll call back.",
        "Cassie: I hope she does.",

        "Mallet: ( Coughing ) Put you down here. Come on. Watch your head. ( Coughing ) All right. Everything's going to be all right. You're safe, okay? Come on. Watch your head. Here we go. You're okay now. Everything's all right. Hey. Hey, don't you go anywhere. Come on. Stick with me, here. Come on. Dinah? All right, come on. One, two. Chip in here, let's go. Do your thing.",
        "Dinah: ( Gags )",
        "Mallet: There we go. There we go.",
        "Dinah: ( Coughing )",
        "Mallet: There you go. Breathe. Breathe. In and out. Okay? In and out, in and out.",
        "Dinah: ( Coughs )",
        "Mallet: Look at me. There you go. Clear your mind. In. ( Inhales ) and out. There you go. In and out. Breathe. Breathe.",
        "Dinah: ( Coughs ) It took you long enough.",

        "Josh: No. You're a drunk, Billy.",
        "Billy: I'm your brother!",
        "Josh: Yeah, I know that. And I would rather see this whole deal go down the drain than see you spin out of control again. You remember what happened before, Billy?",
        "Billy: Come on. Come on, that was an accident.",
        "Josh: You almost killed yourself in the car driving home because you were so drunk.",
        "Billy: What are you going to do? Just hold that over my head forever?",
        "Josh: I wouldn't have even brought it up if you hadn't picked up the bottle tonight, Billy. I can't lose you! Don't you understand that? My kids, Marah and Shayne, they live thousands of miles away. They're living their own life right now, and me and Reva, I don't know if we're going to get past this thing that's pulled us apart from each other. You , Billy, you're everything for me right now. Everything.",
        "Billy: So this is all about you.",

        "Tammy: You're too proud to be nursed back to health? Hey, Sandy, you know some guys would think of this as a great opportunity. Hey. Hey. What happened was an accident. It was not your fault. You didn't do anything. You have no reason to be ashamed or embarrassed.",
        "Sandy: Just go.",
        "Tammy: Hey. What is wrong?",
        "Sandy: Go.",
        "Tammy: Just kiss me. I want to be yours. It's Sandy. He's hurt really bad. I have to go.",

        "Tammy: You saw us. At the barn. Me and Jonathan.",
        "Sandy: You look good together.",

        "Sandy: You kissed him.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, I didn't mean for that, either. I just... but I'm glad that it happened. I am. Because it made me even more sure that I want to be with you. What, you don't believe me? Fine. But I'm not going to let you quit on us, okay? I'm staying.",
        "Sandy: Don't.",
        "Tammy: You don't understand. When I heard that you were this close to being dead, I made a promise and I'm going to keep that promise. This... we are not over.",

What are you doing? Easy, slow down. You almost bought the farm in there. I'll take care of it. What do you want? You want your phone? Why do you want me to have this? What do you want? Do you want me to call someone? Do you want me to call your dad? Huh? No? Show me. What do you want? You want me to press redial? All right, hang on.",
        "Cassie: You know what? If you want to get your stuff, it's really getting late. You need to get it and get out. ( Cell phone rings ) Hey, look at that: Blocked caller ID. Dinah. Dinah?",

        "Cassie: A fire? Where?",
        "Mallet: A building out in the middle of nowhere. You know, it kind of looks like... well actually-- correction-- it looked like your house. I guess Dinah was hiding out in it.",

        "Mallet: Yeah, she is. I'm going to take her to Cedars now. Help's on the way. So if there's any relatives you think she should call or you should call...",
        "Cassie: Yes. I do. Of course. Okay. Thanks, Mallet. All right. Let's go, sweetie.",
        "Edmund: Where are you going?",

        "Olivia: Well, I like the way you think and I like the way you celebrate.",

        "Josh: I need you to take over the Venezuela project.",
        "Bill: What? Wait a minute. My dad's on that. He's all excited about it.",
        "Josh: Yeah, well, things have changed.",
        "Bill: Why?",
        "Josh: It's pretty complicated and I don't want to get into it right now. The bottom line is that Billy... Billy has given up control of the project and I need someone strong to take over for him.",
        "Bill: Look, Josh, I'm flattered-- really, I am-- but I've got to say no.",
        "Josh: Why?",
        "Bill: Well, to be quite honest with you, I'm just not ready to make that kind of commitment right now. Seriously. I just...",
        "Olivia: Bill... I mean, it sounds to me like Josh is really stuck for a replacement. Am I wrong?",
        "Josh: Not at all, no. We need someone as soon as possible. Tomorrow, even.",
        "Olivia: And where is he going to find someone who knows the business as well as you do on such short notice?",
        "Josh: It would really help us out.",
        "Bill: Then, yeah. Yeah. Then yeah, I'm your man, if it's what you need.",
        "Josh: Thank you. I appreciate it.",
        "Bill: Of course, if that's okay with you?",
        "Olivia: Are you kidding? Yes. I think it's great. It's great! It's going to be so great for Lewis, for you, for all of us.",

        "Jonathan: Look, maybe this isn't the place that I should be and maybe this isn't the place that I should say this, but the truth between us is the truth, no matter where we are.",
        "Tammy: I can't...",

        "Jonathan: Look, I told you before, that was an accident.",
        "Tammy: Because his head was somewhere else. Like at my mom's barn, where he saw us all over each other. Yeah. He saw us. Then he went straight to work and this happened.",
        "Jonathan: Like I said before, that's not our fault.",
        "Tammy: Like hell it's not! What we did and what we almost did was wrong.",
        "Jonathan: You look me in the eyes-- look me in the eyes right now-- you tell me that wasn't right. More right than any other damn thing in your life.",
        "Tammy: I don't care how it felt. I made a promise. I'm going to keep that promise.",

        "Rick: Well, that's a good thing. I tell you, if she would have inhaled much more smoke, I would be doing this exam as the coroner. Anyway, I need to get a kit to check her carbon monoxide level. I'll be right back.",
