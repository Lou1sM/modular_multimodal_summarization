        "Olivia: Sorry, what was that? ",
        "Ava: Either you\r\ngo down to the station and you admit to everything that you've done, or\r\nI will. What you are you going to do, Olivia? ",
        "Olivia: All right, sweetie. Jane's going to\r\ntake you to the park and then I'm going to pick you up. I have to meet with\r\nsomebody really important. Maybe the only person who could\r\nprotect us now. Okay? Come on, sweetie. ",

        "Gus: Hey. ",
        "Harley: Are you checking your ovulation\r\nschedule? ",
        "Gus: No thanks, I'll leave that to you. It's\r\nbeen... it's been three months to the day since I kicked the pills? ",
        "Harley: Really? It's been that long already,\r\nhuh? Hey. I love you. ",
        "Gus: I just want to make sure I'm a good\r\nfather and a good role model to the boys, especially if we're going to bring a\r\nlittle life into the world. ",
        "Harley: You're already a good role model to\r\nthose boys. You're a great dad. You know that. You were great with that little\r\nGracie. She adored you. ",
        "Cop: All right. Keep it up, pal, and I'll\r\nput you in shackles. ",
        "Driscoll: I haven't done anything wrong. I'm\r\nthe victim. My baby daughter was stolen from me by a couple of cops. Where are\r\nthey? I know they're here. ",
        "Gus: You Sydney\u2019s father? ",
        "Driscoll: Who wants to know? ",
        "Gus: Me. I'm the cop you're looking for. I\r\ntook your daughter away from you. Man, I'm really glad that you're here. ",

        "Rick: I know. I let it go way too long. I\r\nshould have fixed this. I should have fixed this a long time ago. ",

        "Rick: Sweetheart, do you have any plans\r\ntoday? ",
        "Leah: What's going on? Mom was acting really\r\nweird this morning. ",
        "Rick: I did a real stupid... really stupid\r\nthing. I made a terrible mistake. ",
        "Leah: Dad, that was months ago. We've all\r\nforgiven you. ",
        "Rick: It's a different mistake, sweetheart.\r\nI made things worse between me and your mother by bringing somebody else into\r\nthe picture. I was... I was lonely and I was sad... ",

        "Olivia: I need something from you. You may\r\nbe the only person who can help. ",
        "Alan: What makes you think I would lift a\r\nfinger to help you? ",
        "Olivia: I'm not talking about me, Alan. I'm\r\ntalking about your granddaughter. And if family means as much to you as you say\r\nit does, you'll help me keep Emma safe. ",

        "Coop: It's kind of cold out. I know you're\r\nwearing a light jacket, so why don't we go inside? ",
        "Ava: It's gorgeous outside. You just don't\r\nwant me out in public where Olivia can get to me. ",
        "Coop: Well, can you blame me, okay? I mean,\r\nhow do we know that guy that tried to grab you before isn't going to come back?\r\n",
        "Ava: I told you, I can handle Olivia. ",
        "Coop: Meaning what? Meaning you're going to\r\ngo to the police? ",
        "Ava: If I had to. ",
        "Coop: Okay, well, what is stopping you? ",
        "Ava: Do you see that table over there? Can\r\nyou go grab that table? I just need to make a phone call and I'll meet you over\r\nthere. Thank you. ",
        "Coop: Uh-huh. Marina, hey, look, I need a really big favor from you. I\r\nneed your help, like, I really need your help right\r\nnow. ",
        "Marina: What's wrong? ",

        "Maid: If you need anything, I'll be in the\r\nkitchen. ",
        "Alan: So what is this you want me to do to\r\nhelp keep Emma safe? Safe from what? ",
        "Olivia: Ava Peralta. She was the one who was\r\nbaby sitting Emma when this... ",
        "Alan: Yes, when Emma ingested the perfume.\r\nWhat about it? ",
        "Olivia: You know, you say that kind of\r\ncasually. Is this a remote event for you? ",
        "Alan: Don't start, Olivia. ",
        "Olivia: No, no, you were on a business trip.\r\nYou didn't even come home when your granddaughter was fighting for her life in\r\nthe hospital. ",
        "Alan: Would you have allowed me to see her?\r\nI called every day to check on Emma, so don't accuse me of not caring for her. \r\n",
        "Olivia: Okay. All right.\r\nAll I'm saying is I sat by her side for nights and\r\ndays praying that she would recover. If you were going through something like\r\nthat, Alan, how would you feel about Ava? Would you be in a forgiving mood? \r\n",
        "Alan: Probably want to kill her. ",
        "Olivia: Okay. See, I knew you would\r\nunderstand. ",
        "Alan: Did you try to kill her? ",
        "Olivia: No. I... I had some lapses in\r\njudgment, all right? I said things that I probably shouldn't have and stupid\r\ngirl, she took my threats seriously. ",
        "Alan: \"Stupid girl\"? ",
        "Olivia: Look, she could go to the DA\r\ntoday, press charges against me, and if she does, if they believe her, they\r\ncould take Emma away from me. ",
        "Alan: Olivia, exactly what did you do? ",
        "Olivia: Alan, I'm not going to lose my\r\nchild. I'm not. That's why I'm here, okay, because despite our differences, I\r\nknow you have Emma\u2019s best interests at heart. ",
        "Alan: That's true. ",
        "Olivia: And maybe there's still some\r\naffection for me. I mean, we're so much alike. And you remember the times that\r\nwe shared, the good as well as the bad? ",
        "Alan: Yes, I do remember. And that is why if\r\nyou need my help, all I can say to you is keep dreaming. ",

        "Mel: It's a nice room. You know, when I\r\nfirst found the key, I knew that something was wrong. But I talked myself out\r\nof it. I told myself that Rick needed the room to get away and think, work\r\nthings out on his own. But he wasn't alone here, was he Beth? ",
        "Beth: Rick didn't mean to hurt you. Neither\r\nof us did. ",
        "Mel: You mean you never meant for me to find\r\nout. ",
        "Beth: We were both in a lot of pain. I had\r\njust lost the baby. You had pushed Rick away. Rick and I have been friends\r\nforever. We're just... we're trying to comfort each other. ",
        "Mel: Comfort? Comfort?\r\nThat's funny. When I need comfort, I make some cocoa or I take a hot bath. I\r\ndon't go after another woman's husband. But then again, I'm not that desperate.\r\n",
        "Beth: You know what, Mel? I didn't go after\r\nhim. He was there for the taking. And why? Because you pushed him away. Maybe if you had been a better\r\nwife, he wouldn't have needed this room or me. ",

        "Leah: You and Beth? Daddy,\r\nno. ",
        "Rick: I messed up, okay? I messed up big\r\ntime. It's not the first mistake that I've made, and it won't be the last. I'm\r\nhuman, I'm flawed and I never wanted to you see this side of me, but you have\r\nand there's no running away from what I did to your mom. I was dishonorable to\r\nher and I had an affair and I'm sorry, honey. I am so sorry that I hurt your\r\nmom and I hurt you. And I'm not asking you to forgive me. I'm just asking you\r\nto try to understand how terribly lonely I have been these last couple of\r\nmonths. Beth has just... she's just a friend that I've had since she was your\r\nage, honey. ",
        "Leah: So? ",
        "Rick: Beth was there for me, honey when your\r\nmother wasn't, when I need her and all my other friends ran away from me and\r\nbailed on me, Beth was there for me. ",
        "Leah: And that makes it all right? ",
        "Rick: No. No, honey, it makes... it makes it\r\nworse. It makes it much worse. I'm just trying to tell you what happened, and\r\nit's over. ",
        "Leah: I defended you. I thought mom was\r\nbeing unfair to you. She was right. I hate you! ",

        "Driscoll: I want a lawyer now. ",
        "Gus: I'm a lawyer. I'm also the detective\r\nwho took your baby girl and put her in a good home with her grandmother. So\r\nlet's talk about rights. Not your rights. But the rights of the baby girl who\r\nyou left in your crash pad with your used needles and all the rest of your\r\nstash. ",
        "Driscoll: You know,\r\nyou don't even know what you're talking about. ",
        "Gus: A child has rights. A child has the\r\nright to be protected. And not just from strangers, sometimes from their own\r\nidiot fathers father who makes really bad choices.\r\nIt's a privilege to be a parent, Mr. Driscoll. But unfortunately you've just\r\nthrown your privilege away. And do you want to know what your punishment is?\r\nYou lose your baby girl forever. And I'm going to make sure that happens, I\r\npromise you. Patrick, can you get him out of my face before I smash it? What?\r\nI'm unprofessional? So I'm not going to get an earful? ",
        "Harley: From me? No, from me you would get a\r\nmedal. I love what you said. And our little baby is going to be so lucky to\r\nhave you for a father. ",
        "Gus: I feel like maybe I was talking about\r\nmyself for a minute there, you know, because three months ago I was really was\r\nno better than him. ",
        "Harley: I don't want to talk about that\r\nanymore. Haven't we talked about this enough, right? Let's take this\r\ncalendar... take this calendar away, shall we? Because I have a calendar of my\r\nown, and my calendar tells me that it's an excellent time to start getting down\r\nto some business. ",

        "Beth: Okay, okay, I take responsibility for\r\nmy part in this. But what I will not do is take responsibility for Rick\u2019s\r\nactions or yours or your failed marriage. ",
        "Mel: My marriage didn't fail, Beth, you\r\nsabotaged it. ",
        "Beth: Rick only turned to me after you\r\nturned him away. And why? Because he\r\nwas loyal to a lifelong friend, to Phillip. Wow, what a crime there was.\r\n",
        "Mel: No, the crime was falsifying documents,\r\nlying to police and contributing to an accident that led to man's death. ",
        "Beth: Who am I talking to here? The daughter or the lawyer? What's the matter Mel, you\r\ndidn't time to study for the priesthood on the side? ",
        "Mel: Funny, Beth. ",
        "Beth: He didn't need your counsel or your\r\ndiagnosis or your divinity. What he needed was a wife who would love him, and,\r\nyes, forgive him. ",
        "Mel: Not that it's any of your business, but\r\nI did forgive him. ",
        "Beth: A little half-hearted, don't you\r\nthink? You didn't show up at his hearing at the hospital. You weren't there for\r\nhim a dozen other times when he needed you. And you need to hear this. You know\r\nwhy that was? Because you're just too damn good for him, that's why. ",
        "Mel: No, Beth, I simply have standards,\r\nwhich is a lot more than I can say for you. Okay, I held Rick accountable for\r\nhis actions because, believe it or not, that's what you do when your good\r\nfriend and a good wife. ",
        "Beth: Good friend. You're going to tell me\r\nabout that. ",
        "Mel: Because you don't tell the person you\r\nlove what they want to hear, you tell them the truth. ",

        "Mel: Absolutely. ",
        "Beth: ...No matter how much it hurts? ",
        "Mel: And then you work it out together. Not\r\nby rushing off to someplace where you never got your rocks off as a kid.\r\nEspecially with some slut! ",
        "Beth: You jerked Rick around for months. He\r\nonly came to me when he couldn't bear being rejected by you anymore. So you\r\nwant to tell yourself stories to ease your conscience? You go ahead, but you\r\nleave me out of it. My husband has forgiven me, so I won't need that anymore.\r\nGood luck to you, Mel, you're going to need it. ",
        "Mel: No, Beth, you're going to need the\r\nluck. Because if Alan\u2019s forgiven you, he's going to expect\r\nsomething in return, and his price will be steep. ",
        "Beth: My marriage is none of your business.\r\nAnd as for you and Rick, don't ask me why, but he still wants you. Wish I\r\nthought you deserved him. ",

        "Olivia: I don't want... it's not that\r\nterrible, all right? I just need you to get Ava out of town so she'll stop\r\nspreading these lies, okay? Just for a while. You can't like her anymore than I\r\ndo Alan. If it weren't for her, Lizzie and Coop would be married right now. \r\n",

        "Rick: I thought we were on the right track\r\nthere but I really, really, really screwed up, Harley. So now I don't have a\r\nroof over my head. ",

        "Rick: I really have no one to blame but\r\nmyself. I really, really screwed up this time. Just screwed\r\nup. I messed up. It's my fault. ",

And you what you want, so I\r\nsay you go home and you give it all you got. Fight for what you believe in. \r\n",

        "Rick: No, you guys have been so fantastic\r\nlistening to me go on and on and on and on about my messed up life, not being...\r\nnot judging me, not being judgers, you know, if what I did. You guys just being\r\npeople, being people and I think that's great. So the least I can do is pitch\r\nin and help you with the addition. ",
        "Harley: I... thank you. That's so nice. But... ",
        "Gus: We don't need the help because it's\r\nkind of just a two- person job. ",
        "Rick: You can also need a new set of hands.\r\nHey, Gus, I can hold your tools. ",
        "Gus: Nobody holds my tools. Sometimes my\r\ngirl does, but... ",
