        "Alan: Yes, you heard me right. Phillip has \r\nproof that you murdered Beth. Not that we didn't know it all along. But this \r\ntime the charges will stick. ",
        "Edmund: I did not murder Beth. She died in a \r\nflash flood. The only thing I'm guilty of is not being able to save her life, \r\nthough God knows I tried. ",
        "Alan: Well, we'll see about that. ",
        "Edmund: What possible reason would I have in \r\nthe world to kill her? We loved each other. ",
        "Alan: That's what you brainwashed her into \r\nbelieving. When she finally came to her senses, she went to Mexico to get a \r\ndivorce. You followed her down there and victimized her even more. This time it \r\ncost her her life. That's the way it was, Edmund. ",
        "Edmund: We were working towards a \r\nreconciliation. ",
        "Alan: In your dreams! It's too bad she's not \r\nhere to speak for herself. ",
        "Edmund: Believe me, I would like nothing \r\nbetter. ",
        "(Cell phone rings) ",
        "Alan: Yes. Really? The mob? Well, that's good \r\ninformation to know. ",
        "Edmund: Thank God you're in the room. What \r\nare you doing? ",
        "Lorelei: Why? What's it matter what I\u2019m \r\ndoing? ",
        "Edmund: It looks as if I'm going to have to \r\npush up the date of your grand entrance into Springfield society. ",
        "Lorelei: How come? ",
        "Edmund: You let me worry about that. You \r\nspend your time becoming a convincing Beth as quickly as possible. ",
        "Lorelei: I can pass for her right now. \r\n",
        "Edmund: Oh, really? Could you? What's your \r\nex-husband's name? ",
        "Lorelei: Which one? ",
        "Edmund: Well, let's try the tall millionaire \r\nwho fathered your children. ",
        "Lorelei: Well, I know it. It's Fenton. \r\n",
        "Edmund: Oh, Fenton, that was very good.\u00a0 \r\nPhillip! Good god, you can't get this one wrong. Of all people, Phillip has to \r\nbelieve you're Beth or we're sunk. Now stay right where you are. I'm going to \r\ncome up and we're going to work on this, we're going to drill it into your \r\nskinny little head until you get it right. ",
        "Lorelei: Drill by yourself, darling. I've \r\nbeen studying for hours. This girl needs a break. Yeah, mm. ",

        "\r\nDanny: I swear, you know, when I went after the job at Spaulding, I had no \r\nintention of getting an inside opportunity to steal $25 million from them. I \r\ndidn't. Now it looks like I've got no choice. ",
        "Michelle: Honey, it's a sting, though. And \r\nwhoever's behind this, he's going to end up in prison, not you. Okay? \r\n",
        "Danny: Well, we hope. We hope so. ",
        "Rick: I'm just going to pretend that I just \r\ndidn't hear the word prison just now. ",
        "Danny: No, Michelle's... ",
        "Rick: What's going on, guys? ",
        "Danny: ...Michelle's just talking about maybe \r\ndoing some volunteer work at the local prison, you know, a reading program, a \r\nliteracy program for the inmates. ",
        "Rick: Of course. Right, with all that extra \r\ntime that you have as a mom raising a little boy. ",
        "Michelle: Well, speaking of moms, have you \r\nspoken to Harley yet? ",
        "Rick: Have we spoken, no, not since she \r\ncalled me to tell me that she is driving cross-country so she can have our baby \r\nboy here at home. The only problem is that the woman is literally ready to give \r\nbirth at any moment, and she's still driving across country anyway, and I \r\nhaven't heard from her since, so... ",
        "Michelle: Which has you worried. ",
        "Rick: Of course it does, Michelle. I mean, \r\nwhy couldn't she just, you know, pick up a phone and call me? ",
        "Danny: What? Is something wrong? ",
        "Rick: This is Harley's cell phone number. She \r\ncalled me. ",
        "Michelle: Did she leave a message? \r\n",
        "Rick: No, this is nuts. This is crazy. \r\n",
        "Michelle: Why didn't you hear it ring? \r\n",
        "Rick: I'm trying to figure it out, Michelle. \r\nI mean, I've had this phone with me all after... Wait a minute. I accidentally \r\nswitched phones with Gus Aitoro. ",
        "Danny: Well, how did that happen? When did \r\nyou do that? ",
        "Rick: It was a couple of hours ago, but we \r\nswitched it right... During that time he got a call from Harley and he didn't \r\ntell me. Why wouldn't he tell me? ",
        "Danny: Why? Because he's Gus Aitoro. \r\n",
        "Rick: This is nuts. Come on, Harley. Where \r\nare you? Come on. ",

        "Harley: Oh, it's you, Rick. It's you, isn't \r\nit? I know it's you. Oh, I know it's you. Okay. Don't hang up. I have a plan. \r\n(Gasping) Here I come. I'm coming. Oh! Oh, come on, please. Please! ",
        "Rick: You called me almost an hour ago, why \r\nwouldn't you have the phone on now? Oh, God. ",

        "Olivia: You know, that's all I've ever \r\nwanted, Josh, for us, for things to be good. ",
        "Josh: Well, I'll tell you what, how about if \r\nwe bump it up a notch? Maybe we can get to incredible. How would that be? \r\n",
        "Olivia: Oh, okay. I'm ready if you are.\r\n",
        "Josh: I think we've paid our dues. (Phone \r\nrings) ",

        "Josh: You know what? It might be important.\r\n",
        "Olivia: It could be a telemarketer. \r\n",
        "Josh: Yeah. I'll be quick, I promise. Hello?\r\n",
        "Shayne: (Whispering throughout) Hi, Dad?\r\n",
        "Josh: Son, why are you whispering? \r\n",
        "Shayne: Because I don't want Mom to hear.\r\n",
        "Josh: Why not? ",
        "Shayne: Because it's about her. Look, \r\nsomething weird is going on. Do you hear me? ",
        "Josh: Yes, son, I heard you. But see, I can't \r\nreally get involved in your mother's problems right now. ",
        "Shayne: Dad, look, who do you want me to talk \r\nto, Uncle Billy or Father Ray? ",
        "Josh: No. No. Okay. What's the problem?\r\n",
        "Shayne: Ever since mom came back from that \r\nbed and breakfast place, I mean, well, she brought home a painting. ",
        "Josh: A painting. ",
        "Shayne: Yeah, it's a painting of a seashore \r\nwith sand and rocks and all that stuff. Anyway, it's just like... It was cruddy, \r\nand dirty, and I decided I was going to clean it, and I spilled the cleaning \r\ngoop all over the painting, and I wiped it off, and the seashore disappeared and \r\nthere was another painting underneath it. ",
        "Josh: Of what? ",
        "Shayne: See, that's the whole thing. I don't \r\nknow because Mom has cloth over it and she won't let anyone see it. I mean, \r\nshe's looking at it right now. It looks like she's hypnotized or something. I \r\nmean, it's really creeping me out, Dad. ",
        "Josh: Okay. Well, I'm sure there's an \r\nexplanation. I'll tell you what, I'll look into it, I promise. ",
        "Shayne: Do it soon. Bye. ",
        "Reva: Hey there. ",
        "Shayne: Hey. Mom, I'm going to go to the \r\nmovies with Chris and Dave. ",

        "Reva: Okay. See you later. ",
        "Shayne: Bye. ",
        "Reva: Why do I keep hearing you, Mama? Huh? \r\nAnd why do you keep telling me to trust my heart? Does it have something to do \r\nwith this painting? ",
        "",
        "\r\nOlivia: So, it was about Reva? ",
        "Josh: No, it's actually about a painting. I \r\nknow that sounds strange, but see, Shayne is spooked for some reason. It has \r\nsomething to do with a painting... You know, maybe... maybe he just misses the \r\ndrama of having Marah live under the same roof. ",
        "Olivia: So he's just creating his own dramas?\r\n",
        "Josh: I think that's possible, yes. Listen, \r\nlisten, I'm not going to go running off and getting involved in Reva's problems, \r\nall right? That's not going to happen. ",
        "Olivia: Well, I like the sound of that. Oh. (\r\nPhone rings) No, I'm going to get this one. It's my turn. Hello? ",
        "Alan: Olivia, I need to see you right away-- \r\nnow, as a matter of fact. ",
        "Olivia: My husband and I aren't interested.\r\n",
        "Alan: Ah, so you're not alone. Well, see that \r\nyou are within an hour, or Josh just might find out about Lewis holdings. \r\n",
        "Olivia: I'm hanging up now. ",
        "Alan: Does he know that you're using his name \r\nto commit fraud? I'm on my way. ",
        "Olivia: Okay, well, that was a telemarketer. \r\nYou thought it was Shayne again, didn't you? ",
        "Josh: I just... He rattled me a bit, that's \r\nall. You know, Shayne doesn't usually care about what's going on with other \r\npeople, but he seems to be real worried about his mom right now. ",
        "Olivia: You know, maybe you ought to go over \r\nthere and just see what's up with her. ",
        "Josh: Are you sure about that? ",
        "Olivia: Well, if it will calm Shayne down, \r\nI'm all for it. Go, go. Go be a dad. ",
        "Josh: Okay. Okay. All right. Thank you. I'll \r\ntell you what, I'll... I won't be long. ",

        "Gus: Oh, that's funny, meathead. I'm out \r\nhere, you're in there, you're calling me meathead. Is that any way to talk to \r\nyour former colleague? Is it? And what did you do to this guy? Look at this poor \r\nschlub. He's out cold. ",

        "Harley: Good. ",
        "Gus: I'm going to do that. And I'm sorry. And \r\nlisten, I'll tell you something, this is like an honor for me to protect you and \r\nthe baby, and to get you to a... no birth house jail baby's for you... \r\n",
