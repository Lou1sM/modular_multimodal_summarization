        "Billy runs into Tammy and J.B. outside of Company and warns J.B. not to hurt Tammy. J.B. takes his plan a step further by getting Tammy to admit that she is ready to make love to him now. Michelle and Danny have a huge argument because he wants her to seek help with a memory specialist. Michelle feels there is nothing wrong with her, she is just a different person than the Michelle that he married. Reva continues to worry about Sandy, even though she knows that he has lied to her and everyone. Billy shows up to offer some comfort and gets Josh on the phone for her to talk to him. Sandy wakes up briefly and tries to write a note warning Reva, but J.B. catches him and gives him more morphine to make him pass out again. Later, Reva again promises Sandy that she will protect him, and prove that he didn't kill her son. Cassie is furious when she catches Dinah in Edmunds bed, but Edmund confirms that he told Dinah to stay in his room. After Dinah leaves, he explains to Cassie that he was trying to keep a drunken Dinah from telling everyone that Cassie held her at gunpoint. Cassie confides in a very thankful Edmund that Sandy is not Jonathan. Sebastian asks Ross to help him locate Ed, to which Ross flatly refuses. Blake and Ross make new promises of trust and no secrets from each other in an attempt to get their marriage back on track."

    "Transcript": [
        "Reva: Sandy. You knew Jonathan was missing, that he was dead, and you took his place. How did you know about Jonathan's accident? Were you there when it happened? Or did you make it happen? Oh, my God, Sandy. Did you kill my son?",
        "JB: Tough break, Mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: You look like you're cramming for a test.",
        "Michelle: I'm just trying to learn a little more about this gene research that my dad is doing in Africa.",
        "Sebastian: I wish I had a clearer picture of Dr. Ed Bauer, myself.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, but you said he and your dad weren't...",
        "Sebastian: Yeah, I know. Not exactly on the best of terms, no. But it doesn't matter. I'm just as interested in my father's old enemies as I am...",
        "Michelle: Enemies?",
        "Sebastian: Rivals. As I am his friends.",
        "Danny: Yes. See, there she is. I told you we'd find Mommy, right, buddy? You see her?",
        "Michelle: Hey. My two favorite guys. What's up? High-five.",
        "Sebastian: I should get going, so good luck with your research, Michelle.",
        "Michelle: Thanks. Thanks. I didn't expect you back tonight.",
        "Danny: Are you kidding? There's no way I was going to stay in New York after that conversation we had last night. You had your first memory.",
        "Michelle: I know, but you had a big job interview.",
        "Danny: I canceled it.",
        "Michelle: What are you talking about? That gig sounded perfect for you.",
        "Danny: No way. I had something a lot more important to take care of--like you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Okay. All right, slut. Up and out. Now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: Is your brother still in town?",
        "Blake: Yes, he is.",
        "Ross: For how much longer? Do you know?",
        "Blake: Sebastian hasn't told me the exact hour and minute he's leaving town, if that's what you're asking. Apparently he's staying long enough to get to know some of the people who knew my father.",
        "Ross: Well, he's not going to like what he hears. Nobody had more enemies than Roger Thorpe.",
        "Blake: My father is dead, Ross, remember? The case against him, as you might put it, is closed.",
        "Ross: All I'm saying is that Sebastian is not going to find a lot of fans of Roger Thorpe in this town.",
        "Blake: You know, it wasn't what I was expecting, but I am glad that Sebastian is here.",
        "Ross: Oh. Well, what were you expecting? Hello?",
        "Blake: I got a letter that led me to believe that my father was coming into town instead of Sebastian.",
        "Ross: What? You never said anything about this letter. Did it slip your mind, or is this another one of your secrets?",
        "Blake: (Scoffs) Oh? Like what?",
        "Ross: Like the fact that you were nosing around the lighthouse for no apparent reason.",
        "Blake: I'm sorry, Ross, but I had business there. I am a real estate agent.",
        "Ross: I didn't know the lighthouse was for sale.",
        "Blake: Well, I didn't know you were checking up on me. How did you know I was even there?",
        "Ross: A little birdie named Tony Santos whispered it in my ear. He also whispered that Sebastian was poking around there, too.",
        "Blake: Well, perhaps a few things have slipped my mind lately. But you of all people should understand how that could happen.",
        "Ross: Why is that?",
        "Blake: I don't know. It kind of seems that when Dinah was in town and you forgot to tell me that, that seemed like a secret to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: No, I want some of that!",
        "Danny: I've got your coloring book in here, bud. So, Michelle, listen. I want to run something by you.",
        "Michelle: Mm-hmm?",
        "Danny: And I'm not trying to push or anything like that. It's just that you seemed... well, you sounded really excited about having that memory, and you said that you were interested in remembering more, and if that's really something you want to pursue right now, I want to help you with that, okay? So I did a little research.",
        "Michelle: Well, what do you mean?",
        "Danny: Here you go, buddy. Well, I met with a memory specialist in New York today.",
        "Michelle: A memory specialist?",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Michelle: That's, like, a real job?",
        "Danny: Apparently it is. Actually, I found them online when I was doing a little research. He's a neuro pathologist.",
        "Michelle: Uh-huh.",
        "Danny: And I told him about you having that memory, and he asked if you were having any other symptoms, besides the memory loss, you know, like changes in behavior. So I filled him in on the kind of stuff that's been going on.",
        "Michelle: What? What's been going on?",
        "Danny: Well, you know, Michelle. Just...",
        "Michelle: No.",
        "Danny: The differences.",
        "Michelle: I don't know.",
        "Danny: Yeah, you do. Like the temper, the loss of inhibitions, increase of appetite, stuff like that.",
        "Michelle: And tattoos, right? Danny, that's who I am.",
        "Danny: Well, the doctor actually thinks that it could be symptomatic of the damage that you had to your frontal lobe. And, Michelle, there's amazing work being done now. They can actually regenerate the brain cells and reverse the brain damage.",
        "Michelle: So my personality is a symptom. That's the diagnosis?",
        "Danny: Okay.",
        "Michelle: And you went all the way to see this wonderful doctor without even telling me anything about it.",
        "Danny: Well, Michelle, I didn't want you to get your hopes up if the guy turned out to be a quack or... look, I just... you know, I... you were so excited and I... forget it. If you want, I've made an appointment for you with him. I just... I thought it would be something fun that we could do. The three of us, we could go to New York together, like a little vacation. I just thought it would be something you'd be interested in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: It's chilly, but you were right. I could use the air. And I am starving. You know me so well.",
        "JB: Even... even better than you know.",
        "Billy: (Clears throat)",
        "Tammy: Uncle Billy.",
        "Billy: Hey.",
        "Tammy: You're back from Cross Creek.",
        "Billy: Yeah, well, the family is in trouble; I couldn't stay away. Thought I'd come down and see how your aunt and your cousin are doing. Then I thought I'd pick up a little feel-good food for Reva on my way over to the hospital.",
        "Tammy: It's great that you came. Oh, I'm sorry. Uncle Billy.",
        "JB: Howdy, Uncle Bill.",
        "Billy: I know who you are. No need for introduction.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Jonathan Randall. R-a-n-d-a-l-l. I need to know if somebody contacted you recently about his disappearance. I don't have a date, but there must be some kind of a report. Because I have reason to believe that he disappeared in the mountains over your town. So there's no report? There's no witnesses? There's nothing? So you're telling me that this has been a complete waste of time?",
        "Edmund: Reva, what's wrong?",
        "Reva: I'm still trying to reach Joshua, and it's just very frustrating.",
        "Edmund: I can imagine. Any change with Sandy? Reva, I promise I'm going to find the man that drove the car into your boy, okay? Hey, what is it?",
        "Reva: Nothing, nothing. I just need to be alone.",
        "Edmund: Sure, sure. If you need anything, just call me, all right?",
        "Reva: Thanks. Could I have lost Jonathan forever because of you? Could you really be that kind of a monster?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Cassie, can you please stop talking, so I...",
        "Cassie: What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Dinah: Does Edmund have any aspirin around this place?",
        "Cassie: All you had to do was get on a bus or a plane and just be gone. But you didn't go. And your sick obsession with me is getting more and more twisted every day. But let's see how you deal with it when you're carted back to jail.",
        "Dinah: Jail?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, that's where they put people who do things like breaking and entering. You broke into his suite, you're sleeping in his bed and you're wearing his clothes. Give me a break, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: You can call the police all you want, but Edmund let me in. See?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: I don't want to get into another argument about Dinah, but I certainly don't want you to start keeping secrets from me again, especially when it comes to Roger.",
        "Blake: Oh, so your secrets are justified; it's just mine the ones... they're the real trouble.",
        "Ross: Somehow I thought that when Roger died, somehow it would be liberating to you.",
        "Blake: What?",
        "Ross: I mean, you would no longer have to bear the burden of being Roger Thorpe's daughter.",
        "Blake: I will always be Roger's daughter, whether he's alive or dead. And just for the record, it's not a burden, for me or Sebastian, thank you.",
        "Ross: So then you've compared notes.",
        "Blake: Well, you know, honey, we are brother and sister. And you want to know how he talks about Roger? He's not only okay with the fact that he's Roger's son, he is proud of it.",
        "Ross: Well, that pretty much tells me all I need to know about your brother.",
        "Sebastian: Um, sorry. I hope I'm not catching you at a bad time. Ross, I need your help. Or more accurately, Roger needs your help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: You want to run inside and get the orders I got for Reva? Please?",
        "Tammy: Okay. I'll be right back.",
        "Billy: She's quite a girl, isn't she?",
        "JB: Yeah, she is. Do we know each other?",
        "Billy: No, we don't.",
        "JB: You said you knew me.",
        "Billy: No, I said I knew who you are--as in, the kind of guy you are.",
        "JB: All right, what kind is that?",
        "Billy: That's going to be bad news, especially when it comes to a nice girl like her.",
        "JB: I guess I made a heck of a first impression.",
        "Billy: Look, let me say this once: You treat her good, or I will find you, and you will be sorry. Now, it doesn't get any clearer than that in this family. Okay?",
        "Tammy: Here it is.",
        "Billy: Thank you.",
        "Tammy: One Buzz burger with everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: You know, I like who I am now, Danny. And actually, that's funny, because I thought you did, too.",
        "Danny: I do, Michelle.",
        "Michelle: Then why are you so quick to label everything that makes me me as a symptom?",
        "Danny: That's not what I'm saying.",
        "Michelle: Well, that's how you're acting. It's, like, the only Michelle you're going to be happy with is the one you that married, and guess what, Danny? She's gone. I don't know how many times I have to tell you, but she's gone. Gone! Gone!",
        "Danny: Will you take it easy?",
        "Michelle: Oh, what am I, embarrassing you now? Oh, geez. I'm so sorry. I can't help it, because I've got brain damage! You know, Danny, you should look in the mirror because you made me who I am today. It's amazing what one little warehouse explosion can do, isn't it? Yes, big boy, you did it to me. You made me who I am, so check it out!",
        "Robbie: Daddy!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You stole those keys, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: I can understand why Edmund wouldn't tell you about this. He had to think you'd go bonkers. Listen, don't be angry at Edmund. He was a real prince tonight.",
        "Cassie: Really?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. I found myself at a bar, and things just got a little crazy, that's all.",
        "Cassie: Well, I'm afraid to consider what you find crazy.",
        "Dinah: I had a few drinks, then a few more, and before I knew it, I was throwing myself my own pity party, which is not too hard to figure out why. I mean, I may not be in jail, but who's kidding who? I don't think I'm going to have much of a chance of leading a normal life in this town since it is so rabidly pro-Cassie.",
        "Cassie: You could always leave.",
        "Dinah: (Laughs) now, what fun would that be, huh? Anyway, I got a little out of control. And from what I remembered, I found myself on top of a pool table putting on, really I guess, a one-woman show featuring an update of my life story and a few broken glasses, which is when Edmund came in.",
        "Cassie: And gave you his keys.",
        "Dinah: Mm-hmm. And pulled me out of there and threw me in a cab and sent me here. Look, Cassie, Edmund could have walked away, but he didn't. He stayed and he rescued me. And I think that says so much about the man. Don't you think?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: No. This isn't who you are.",
        "Sandy: How do you know? I lied to you. I lied to your whole family. You even caught me stealing money from Josh.",
        "Reva: It wasn't about the money. And you stayed after that.",
        "Sandy: Mm-hmm. To make you love me. And it was so easy, too. You had all that guilt about Jonathan. All I had to do was open my eyes wide and squeeze out a few tears and, presto, instant son. Instant chance to make all that guilt disappear.",
        "Reva: No. What we have is real, Sandy.",
        "Sandy: Sure it is. Just like the last few weeks. How I made you need me, with Marah and Shayne and Josh gone.",
        "Reva: You saved Tammy. How do you explain that?",
        "Sandy: That was instinct. What a mistake that was, huh? Good thing you were there to donate your liver to a con artist and murderer in need.",
        "Reva: You're not those things.",
        "Sandy: How do you know?",
        "Reva: Because I won't let it be. I know you. You're not a killer. I know you. I love you.",
        "Sandy: Reva, Reva, Reva. You always think with your heart. This time you are wrong.",
        "Reva: I love you. I love you. I'll prove it. I'll prove this isn't you. I won't let it be. Sandy? Sandy, wake up. Wake up and tell me I'm right, that you couldn't have killed Jonathan. Please wake up and tell me... (sighs)",
        "Cop: Something wrong, Mrs. Lewis?",
        "Reva: I think I need to report a crime.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: Actually, Sebastian, this is not a very good time at all.",
        "Blake: Oh, no, it is actually, Sebastian. It's a great time. I always have time for you. Come on.",
        "Sebastian: Well, I'm flattered, Chrissy. But I have the sneaking suspicion that maybe I was the cause of some marital strife.",
        "Ross: What is it I can help you with?",
        "Sebastian: I'm trying to locate a friend of yours, Ross, Dr. Ed Bauer. Do you know how I can find him?",
        "Ross: Do you have business with Ed?",
        "Sebastian: If looking for forgiveness is business, then yes, I am. Tying up loose ends with father's friends was only half my mission. He desired closure with his adversaries as well.",
        "Ross: That should take quite awhile.",
        "Blake: Are you saying he left a note for Ed, too?",
        "Sebastian: More like a message that I'm to deliver in person. Now, look, I know you and my father have had your differences, Ross, and I'm asking you to put those aside for now and help me, okay? Please, for the sake of progress.",
        "Blake: I just can't believe that in his final moments, my father was trying to make amends. Well, of course Ross will help you.",
        "Ross: Like hell I will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Robbie: Mommy, you were yelling.",
        "Michelle: I know. I know. Gosh, I'm sorry. Robbie, I'm sorry. I... you know, sometimes grownups talk a little louder than they're supposed to talk. You know, they yell loud sometimes, they sing loud. They even laugh loud, like this. (Laughs) you know, and even little kids sometimes, they can laugh out, too. See? See?",
        "Robbie: So you okay, Mommy?",
        "Michelle: I am totally okay. I am so okay. Not even one single thing wrong with me. Not even one teensie, eensie thing. Just ask Daddy.",
        "Danny: Hey, bud, Mommy's fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: What is the procedure in dealing with a missing person's case?",
        "Cop: Well, it depends on how long the person's been missing, if there was any kind of foul play involved.",
        "Reva: Say the person's been missing for over a year and you really don't know about foul play. Billy?",
        "Billy: Hey.",
        "Reva: Oh, my God. Thank God you're here.",
        "Billy: Is there a problem here?",
        "Reva: No problem.",
        "Cop: Okay. Well, let me know if you want to talk any more about that case.",
        "Reva: Thanks. I will.",
        "Billy: So hey, darling, what was that all about?",
        "Reva: They just... they haven't been able to locate the hit-and-run driver.",
        "Billy: Sweetie, sweetie, sweetie. I know you'd move heaven and earth to save your kids. Now, you let the police do their job and you just concentrate on getting yourself...",
        "Reva: But it's my baby. It's Jonathan.",
        "Billy: But Jonathan is going... the doctors say he's going to be fine. Sweetie, look. Hey, don't hold it in. Come on, you let it out. Let it out, please.",
        "Reva: Billy's he's gone. He's gone. Jonathan's gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I heard what Uncle Billy said to you.",
        "JB: Oh, I'm cool with it.",
        "Tammy: Well, I'm not. I'm sick of my family trying to nail you the first time they meet you. They don't even know you.",
        "JB: Look, I honestly feel like your family doesn't give you enough credit. Here you are, this incredible girl who knows her own head, who is 100% capable of making her own decisions, like what she wants and who you want.",
        "Tammy: Do you know what you want? Who you want?",
        "JB: Yeah, yeah. Do you?",
        "Tammy: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Get out of here!",
        "Dinah: I'm going to consider it a compliment that you could think I could ever dream up such a wild story.",
        "Cassie: Well, we all know the fantasy life that you have, okay?",
        "Dinah: Cassie, it happened. The whole thing happened. Edmund saved me from myself and offered me to crash at his place. That's the truth, the whole truth.",
        "Cassie: The truth? See, Dinah, you wouldn't know the truth if it jumped up and bit you on your butt, okay?",
        "Edmund: Actually, in this case she does. I asked her to stay here, Cassie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: Ross, we're talking about my father's dying wish.",
        "Sebastian: His wish to make amends with ed.",
        "Ross: I understand the theory. But in practice it's impossible. At this point in time, Ed can't be reached. But even if he could, I assure you, Sebastian, he would not accept a call from you. The bad feelings you spoke of, some of them go back decades, and they run very deeply. So my advice is to close the book on Roger's relationship with Ed Bauer and be content with the last wishes you have already fulfilled for Roger.",
        "Sebastian: Okay. Thanks for the advice, and I'll keep it in mind. I'll let you two get to marital matters. I hope to run into you again before I leave town.",
        "Blake: You're leaving?",
        "Sebastian: Yeah. Don't worry, Chrissy. I'll say good-bye to you before I go, okay?",
        "Blake: But, wait a minute. I thought your plan was to hang... Sebastian... well, good. Good. Are you happy now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Leave, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: You offered me your place and now you're taking it back? Okay.",
        "Cassie: Aren't you forgetting something? The keys, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: Oh, the keys. I'll make sure that you get the shirt back later.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I dragged the woman out of a bar and asked her to stay here, not to save her, but to save you.",
        "Cassie: Oh, thank you! Thank you!",
        "Edmund: Cassie, the woman was drunk, dancing on a pool table, launching into a tirade, a very public tirade about the crazy woman who dragged her into a car at gunpoint.",
        "Cassie: I should have killed her while I had the chance.",
        "Edmund: And I wanted to get her out of there before she blurted out your name.",
        "Cassie: So you brought her here? You gave her the keys to your place?",
        "Edmund: Yes. To get her to shut up, yes, I did. And the only mistake I made was... I didn't tell you right away, Cassie. And I'm sorry. I am. Come here. Come here.",
        "Edmund: You know, I've made nothing but mistakes tonight. I was at the hospital earlier, and I tried to make Reva feel better by telling her I'd find the man who ran down her son with a car, and, gosh, she just completely shut down.",
        "Cassie: It wasn't your fault. That had nothing to do with you. I have to tell you something.",
        "Edmund: What?",
        "Cassie: Sandy's not Jonathan. That kid in that hospital bed is not Reva's son.",
        "Edmund: Wait, wait, wait. If... if... then who's Sandy? Where's Jonathan?",
        "Cassie: We don't know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: You are like the one good thing in all the crummy stuff that's been happening lately. Everyone says you should wait for the right guy to come along. Well, you're the guy. I want to be with you, too, JB I'm ready.",
        "JB: Those are the magic words. I'm going to make your first time so special. It's going to be a night you'll never forget.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Reva, Sandy's right there. And he's all hooked up and all the correct things are beeping, and he's going to be fine. And I understand in a large part that's due to you.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, I'm just a little emotional about the whole thing.",
        "Billy: Why don't I find that strange? I'm not little brother, but I am big brother. Just about as good.",
        "Reva: I could do a lot worse.",
        "Billy: Yeah, you could. Besides that, look. I brought Buzz burgers. (Laughs)",
        "Reva: Oh, no. Please. I'm not even hungry.",
        "Billy: Okay. I think I know something that you need right now. Take a little ride with me, okay? (Grunting)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "JB: I have to go take care of something. But I'll call you as soon as I'm done.",
        "Tammy: I can't wait.",
        "JB: Me either here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Darling, you're with a man who has a plan. Now, look, you don't honestly think that I came all the way down here from Cross Creek and got out of that fight up there just to bring you takeout, do you?",
        "Reva: Billy, I'm not really in the mood for games...",
        "Billy: Shh. Shh. Wait a minute. One second. Yeah, hey. You ready? Okay, good. Say hello.",
        "Reva: Hello? Oh, my God. Oh, Joshua. (Laughter) Billy...",
        "Billy: Talk... talk to him.",
        "Reva: Oh, Bud. Oh, my God, I feel like you've been gone for a hundred years. How are you? Are you all right? Me? I'm fine. I just have so much to tell you, and I don't even know where to start.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: You know, you could have been a little more enthusiastic when you told Robbie there was nothing wrong with me.",
        "Danny: Right, Michelle. But there is.",
        "Michelle: Oh, yeah? What?",
        "Danny: Something wrong with you. Look, Michelle, I'm really at the end of my rope here. I really am. I'm serious. You can dance in restaurants or get tattoos, open clubs, redefine yourself all you want, but the truth is you refuse to accept the fact that you suffered a major injury when that warehouse blew up.",
        "Michelle: Thanks to the bomb that you set off.",
        "Danny: You were in a coma, Michelle. You suffered major trauma to your brain with lifelong consequences.",
        "Michelle: You don't know that for sure.",
        "Danny: Yeah, I do. And so do you. Michelle, you cannot live the rest of your life like this. It's not safe. It's not healthy. And it is not normal.",
        "Michelle: Is that what you think?",
        "Danny: Why do you think I'm trying to help you?",
        "Michelle: You know, all along you've been telling me that I'm fine, that I'm doing great, that there's nothing wrong with me that time won't take care of. Now you're telling me I'm damaged?",
        "Danny: Yeah, that's what I'm telling you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: I'm going to go get a drink. And when I return, why don't you try making a little eye contact, okay? (Cell phone rings)",
        "Blake: Hello?",
        "Sebastian: Chrissy, it's Sebastian.",
        "Blake: You're not leaving this soon, are you?",
        "Sebastian: No. I just wanted to spare Ross the details of the trip I'm planning. But I think you need to hear about them.",
        "Blake: Why?",
        "Sebastian: Because, Chrissy, I want you to go with me. I think father would have wanted it that way.",
        "Blake: You know, I can't talk about this right now, all right?",
        "Sebastian: I understand. Just think about it, okay?",
        "Blake: Oh.",
        "Ross: Blake, I don't want anything to come between us--not Dinah, not Sebastian, and certainly not the \"Springfield Journal.\"",
        "Blake: You make me so mad sometimes.",
        "Ross: Likewise. But I love you and you love me, and we both love our kids and we love our marriage. And keeping secrets is poison to that marriage. So it has to stop. From this moment on I promise to trust you implicitly and not hide anything from you.",
        "Blake: That's good. That's great.",
        "Ross: You have to reciprocate, hold up your end of the bargain.",
        "Blake: Well, absolutely. I will do my best there, Ross. And let me tell you something for the record about Sebastian. I know for a fact that he only has my best interests at heart. So if you're going to start trusting me, trust me on that.",
        "Sebastian: Dad, I'm trying to do what you asked. But it's every man for himself now. You understand.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: How could we have let him insinuate himself into our lives?",
        "Cassie: I don't know what's harder on Reva, knowing that Sandy isn't Jonathan or loving him anyway, you know?",
        "Edmund: I've got to call the police.",
        "Cassie: Wait. You can't call the police. Reva begged me not to say anything. You can't call the police.",
        "Edmund: All right, I won't say a word.",
        "Cassie: Thank you.",
        "Edmund: No, Cassie, thank you. Thank you for trusting me with the truth.",
        "Cassie: I love you, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: I love you. You know, we're pretty good together.",
        "Cassie: We are. We are. And nothing's going to come between us, right? No one. Not even Dinah. If they do, we're just going to deal with them together.",
        "Dinah: How fun is it Cassie, huh? Finding me in Edmund's bed? I remember when I found you in Hart's bed after he rescued you from the bar. Okay, this is a very good beginning, but you haven't even begun to feel what I felt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "JB: Hey, buddy. Good to see you. So you made it through the surgery. Now you're a survivor, just like I was when you dropped me off that mountain and I didn't die like you wanted me to. But don't talk. Don't talk. Shh. Close your mouth. You need to save your strength and rest. Here. Let me help you. A little extra morphine ought to do the trick. Yeah, I don't need you waking up just yet. Not until I take care of a few things. Nighty-night, sandman. I'll see you soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I spoke to Josh. We talked about Marah and Shayne. I told him how well our surgery went. I told him I loved him and how much I missed him, and... but I didn't tell him about you. Not a word, and I don't know why, because he is my lifeline, my soul mate and my best friend. And I don't know who you are. But I know I have to protect you. And even though you've given me reason to doubt you every day, something deep down inside of me says, \"believe.\" And I have to listen to that. I have to find the truth, Sandy. I have to prove that you didn't kill my son.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Phillip: I should have you arrested. I would be completely within my rights to try to get full custody of him.",
        "Harley: You're a few months out of a loony bin. Good luck in family court.",
        "Michelle: Just tell me how she did it, Danny. Tell me how she did it.",
        "Danny: Michelle...",
        "Michelle: Tell me how I could make you feel good.",
        "Danny: Don't..",
        "Michelle: Tell me.",
        "Danny: Knock it off."
