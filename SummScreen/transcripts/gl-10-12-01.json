        "Reva: Who are you? \r\n",
        "Regina: Don't be impertinent. I'm Regina Robechaux. I'm the mistress of\r\n\r\nthis house. You may call me Madame Robechaux, or ma'am, if you must. \r\n",
        "Reva: Yes, ma'am. \r\n",
        "Regina: I assume they explained why you're here. \r\n",

        "Reva: No. No. Uh, I think I'm just tired. \r\n",
        "Regina: Oh. Well, yes, I can imagine. Ever since those damned Yankees\r\n\r\ntook over, everything's been at sixes and sevens. It's wonder I even got a \r\nnurse during wartime. \r\n",
        "Reva: Wartime? \r\n",
        "Regina: Please, don't repeat everything I say. It's most annoying to \r\nus. \r\n",
        "Reva: But I don't want to be annoying, ma'am. \r\n",
        "Regina: Well, I can't go on calling you nurse. What's your name? \r\n",
        "Reva: My... Reva. Reva Shayne. \r\n",

        "Reva: Oh, my mother gave this to me. \r\n",
        "Regina: Oh. Well, I like it very much. I assume you know why you're \r\nhere? \r\n",
        "Reva: Maybe you should give my instructions to me. \r\n",
        "Regina: Yes. My husband was wounded in battle, and he needs expert \r\ncare so he doesn't lose a limb to that dreadful gangrene. \r\n",
        "Reva: So I'm to change his bandages and make sure everything's sterile\r\n\r\nand give him antibiotics? \r\n",
        "Regina: Anti-what? \r\n",
        "Reva: Plenty of fluids so that he can replenish any blood that he might\r\n\r\nhave lost. \r\n",
        "Regina: Well, do everything you can. My husband is most dear to me. \r\n",

        "Olivia: He was very angry that we brought in new investors for the \r\nharbor \r\nproject. \r\n",
        "Josh: But he said... \r\n",
        "Olivia: He said that to save face, but he made it really clear to me \r\nthat in \r\nprivate was going to raise a big stink about it. \r\n",
        "Josh: Why didn't you want me here to back you up? \r\n",
        "Olivia: Because... Because it was my idea to expand the investment pool\r\n\r\nand... I got us into this mess, Josh; I want to get us out of it. And I did... I\r\n\r\nknew he wouldn't take a slug at me, but you, you know. And I don't want to \r\nsee that headline, \"Josh Lewis maims head of Spaulding empire.\" \r\n",
        "Josh: I might have done that. \r\n",
        "Olivia: Yeah. Yeah, there's just so much bad blood between the two of\r\n\r\nyou, and I want to get through this project without spilling any of it. Besides,\r\n\r\nI've always been very good at using my feminine wiles. \r\n",
        "Josh: Don't even joke about that. Olivia, it's demeaning. You can hold\r\n\r\nyour own against any man in a business meeting without that. \r\n",
        "Olivia: You know I... You have to know how much it means to me that \r\nyou believe in me so much. \r\n",
        "Josh: Don't do that. Don't do that either. Don't handle me. \r\n",
        "Olivia: I was trying to handle Alan. You're right. I mean, you're \r\nright. If \r\nyou have that much confidence in me, I should at least have that much \r\nconfidence in you that you won't blow this deal just for the satisfaction of \r\npopping him. Please forgive me. \r\n",

Anyway, I grabbed onto a branch \r\nthat was sticking out of the mud, and I held on for as long as I could until I\r\n\r\nwas able to pull myself up onto the bank.
