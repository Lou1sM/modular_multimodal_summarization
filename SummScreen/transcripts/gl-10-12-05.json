        "Jeffrey offers Edmund a deal that he won't press charges if Edmund leaves town and Cassie and Hope for good. Edmund refuses to take it. Mallet arrests Edmund and makes him wait around the hospital with him, much to Edmund's chagrin. Ava calls Bill and lets him know his dad is drinking again. Bill confronts Billy and later when Reva takes over Billy explains that seeing Bill's embarrassment over his drinking is what made him realize how bad what happened was. When Bill gets home, Olivia is ready to celebrate his promotion again but Bill leaves due to her insensitivity. He later questions Ava about what happens and she fills him in on Olivia eating one of the olives out of the drinks. Cassie arrives home to find Dinah there. Dinah claimed she did what she did because she was in love with Edmund. Cassie's comment about how Edmund got the baby surprises Dinah, who later takes baby Hope from the farm, while Jeffrey and Cassie argue on whether Dinah needs to go to the hospital or to jail."

        "Cassie: Mrs. Chitwood? Mrs. Chitwood. Hello, Mrs. Chitwood? Oh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: What are you doing?",
        "Mallet: I'm taking you down to the station.",
        "Edmund: On what grounds?",
        "Mallet: Suspicion.",
        "Edmund: That's it, suspicion? That's not a charge, Detective. It's grounds for a lawsuit-- not to mention ample reason for you to lose your job.",
        "Mallet: Well, I guess I have to take my chances, won't I? Let's see, we're looking at kidnapping, arson, attempted puffed. Last time I remember those are serious crimes.",
        "Edmund: None of which I committed if you want to find a guilty party, find Dinah.",
        "Mallet: Dinah's hands are definitely dirty, but she didn't try to turn herself into a crisp. She would have needed help.",
        "Edmund: She lives to punish Cassie.",
        "Mallet: But you were the one that hired her and chose her as your surrogate, didn't you? That's some interesting logic there, Winslow.",
        "Edmund: You're wasting your time, Detective. You need to find Dinah before it's too late.",
        "Mallet: I'm not worried about her. I'm sure we'll find her. You are my concern right now. Comprende?",
        "Jeffrey: I'll take it from here, Detective. I do need a favor, though. Would you go by Cassie Winslow's farm and see if she heard from Dinah Marler?",
        "Mallet: Sure, I'll send a uniform out right now.",
        "Jeffrey: No, I want you to go.",
        "Mallet: Okay. Okay.",
        "Jeffrey: Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: To your new position. Those Venezuelans aren't going to know. You are going put Lewis on the world map.",
        "Bill: Well, honey, Lewis isn't exactly chump change. You know, my granddaddy, my dad, Josh, they worked hard to make Lewis what it is today.",
        "Olivia: They did, but you're going to work harder and make it even bigger.",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Olivia: What is it?",
        "Bill: Just my dad. He really had his heart set on this.",
        "Olivia: Your dad is going to be fine. He's going to be fine. I'm sure of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Look, I ordered six cases, not five.",
        "Deliveryman: Look, buddy, I understand that, but it's right here. Your handwriting, your fax.",
        "Billy: I don't care what the paper says; my order is always six boxes.",
        "Deliveryman: Maybe you drank the last case.",
        "Billy: Oh, you're a smart guy, huh? Maybe you better get the hell out of here before you eat the boxes. How do you like that?",
        "Ava: Bill, it's Ava.",
        "Bill: Hi, Ava.",
        "Ava: I think you better get down here. Your dad is in trouble.",
        "Bill: What's wrong?",
        "Ava: I just think you need to get down here.",
        "Olivia: What's going on?",
        "Bill: It's my dad. Something's wrong.",
        "Olivia: What?",
        "Bill: I don't know. But I got to go, okay?",
        "Olivia: Okay.",
        "Billy: We'll have no empty glasses tonight, gentlemen. Ava, keep 'em coming.",
        "( Laughter ) ( Knock at the door )",
        "Reva: Oh, what are we celebrating?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Here you go. Have a seat. There you go.",
        "Edmund: Is this really necessary?",
        "Jeffrey: Necessary? Necessary? You're lucky I'm stopping here, you're lucky I don't throw this bed out the window with you attached.",
        "Edmund: Your police force is corrupt, and so are you.",
        "Jeffrey: That's not too smart, Edmund. Insulting the guy who holds the key to your freedom. You know, I really want... I really want to show you some mercy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Come on, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: The baby, the baby.",
        "Cassie: What about the baby? I want to you tell me everything, Dinah. What about the baby?",
        "( Knock at the door )",
        "Mallet: Cassie, it's A.C. Mallet. Are you in there? ( Knocking ) Cassie?",
        "Cassie: Just a minute! Come on, get up. Help me out here, Dinah. Come on. ( Knocking on door ) Coming! What's up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Well, have some. Bill had to run out and I'd hate for it to go to waste.",
        "Reva: What are we drinking to?",
        "Olivia: You haven't heard? Bill is new point man on the Venezuelan project.",
        "Reva: Bill?",
        "Olivia: Yeah. The emissaries requested him and Josh signed off on it.",
        "Reva: When did this happen?",
        "Olivia: A couple hours ago.",
        "Reva: But I thought Billy was the one that was talking to them.",
        "Olivia: Well he did. I guess they prefer Bill.",
        "Reva: That's great news for Bill.",
        "Olivia: Yes. Billy is going to be fine. These things happen.",
        "Reva: I know, Olivia, but this government deal meant a lot to him.",
        "Olivia: It meant a lot to all of us. It's a huge deal it's not like the company lost it.",
        "Reva: Yeah.",
        "Olivia: You're being sentimental. There's no place for emotions in business, you know that.",
        "Reva: Let me tell you something, Olivia, Lewis is still around because of raw emotion and a lot of sweat.",
        "Olivia: All right. All right. Maybe it just came down to personality.",
        "Reva: This would have been a big win for Billy. He really needed this.",
        "Olivia: I guess they realized we could give them something different.",
        "Reva: We? Wait a minute. We? Bill landed this job, Olivia, not you.",
        "Olivia: Bill is my husband; we're a team. Kind of like you and Josh used to be.",
        "Reva: So, I guess Bill got exactly what you wanted him to have.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, I guess he did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Woman: Do it. Come on, you can do it. ( Laughter )",
        "Bill: How long has he been --",
        "Ava: A while. Anything I can do?",
        "Bill: You can throw on a pot of coffee.",
        "Woman: Let's see. ( Laughter )",
        "Bill: What are you doing?",
        "Billy: Public Relations. ( Laughs )",
        "Bill: You're drinking. You're drunk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: I haven't done anything wrong, Mr. O'Neill. Except perhaps love Cassie, and that brought me into a bad element.",
        "Jeffrey: A bad element? Dinah.",
        "Edmund: Yes. You know better than anyone else. How deranged she is, how much she wants Cassie's life. I just was taken in by it as much as anyone else.",
        "Jeffrey: That's a little hard to swallow, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Really? I didn't know the baby was lost until the very end.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, and that's why you decided to buy another one as a replacement?",
        "Edmund: I wanted Cassie to be happy. Cassie wanted that baby. I didn't want to break her heart.",
        "Jeffrey: ( Sighs ) I'm still listening.",
        "Edmund: Well, when Dinah realized she could never have me she went over the deep end. She built a house that looked just like Cassie's. Who knows what she was planning to do next?",
        "Jeffrey: According to Detective, that house was built inside of building that you own.",
        "Edmund: Obviously part of the plan to set me up.",
        "Jeffrey: Obviously. Because if she couldn't have you, then she was going to spend the rest of her life trying to make you miserable, is that it?",
        "Edmund: Well ,one would assume. Look at it this way, Dinah came to town and made Cassie's life miserable. I have done nothing but try to make Cassie happy.",
        "Jeffrey: You know what? What you're saying makes a lot of sense. Maybe Dinah is the mastermind to all of this. After all, I was wrong about Hope being Michelle's baby.",
        "Edmund: Good. Then you understand--",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, but the thing is, Edmund, I don't care.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Listen, Cassie, Dinah went missing from the hospital.",
        "Cassie: You're kidding?",
        "Mallet: That's why Jeffrey sent me over here, to make sure everything is all right.",
        "Cassie: Everything's fine.",
        "Mallet: Yeah? You haven't heard from her, no contact from her, anything like that?",
        "Cassie: I wouldn't be here if I had.",
        "Mallet: That's true you seem pretty hell bent on getting some answers.",
        "Cassie: Sorry about that earlier if I was rude.",
        "Mallet: I totally understand what you're up against.",
        "Cassie: You do?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I'm a cop. It's all about getting at the truth.",
        "Cassie: I don't know if you're going to get that from Dinah. Because she's a master at disappearing.",
        "Mallet: Are you okay? You don't seem very concerned or upset about this.",
        "Cassie: No, I'm just... I've been through this with her, you know. It took me a long time to get justice before so--",
        "Mallet: Well, don't give up hope just yet; she couldn't have gotten very far.",
        "Cassie: You're right. You're right.",
        "Mallet: You know, maybe I should put a uniform on the property just in case.",
        "Cassie: You know, I don't think she's going to come by here, but fine, just in case.",
        "Mallet: Okay, it couldn't hurt, probably make Jeffrey feel better, too. Make everybody feel more security.",
        "Cassie: Sure. All right.",
        "Mallet: Okay. I'll get out of your hair now. I'm going to go question your ex- husband some more.",
        "Cassie: Good luck.",
        "Mallet: Thank you. You know, I have a feeling I kind of need it because he's kind of a shifty one, that guy.",
        "Cassie: A.C., Can you make sure you guys don't get too close to the house? I don't want to freak out my son.",
        "Mallet: Sure. No problem.",
        "Cassie: Great.",
        "Dinah: Why did you do that?",
        "Cassie: Because I wanted to do it myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: My boy. Thanks. Um, just go home, okay?",
        "Bill: No. Not going anywhere, Dad.",
        "Billy: No?",
        "Bill: No. What happened? Tell me what happened. Could you please tell me what happened to 13 years, Dad, of being clean and sober? All done? Is this where it ends? Tonight this is where it ends? I mean, why? Dad, of all nights, would you slip up tonight because that's what this is a slip up, maybe I couldn't help you, maybe I couldn't fix things when I was a kid, but I will help you now.",
        "Billy: I don't want your help.",
        "Bill: What are you going to do, turn your back on me is that what you're telling me?",
        "Billy: I slipped, okay, I slipped and fell.",
        "Bill: Yes, you slipped and fell. So how about some coffee? We're going to give you some coffee.",
        "Billy: No.",
        "Bill: What? You want more of this? Is this what is going to make you happy now, Dad?",
        "Billy: I've seen that look before. You're ashamed of me.",
        "Bill: I am not ashamed of you. I am never ashamed of you, Dad, but I've been down this road before and it scares me to know what can happen to you.",
        "Billy: It scared me, too. I mean, I don't know how it happened. It was supposed to be a good night for me and it started out to be for -- Bill, I'm telling you. I was old Billy, I could do no wrong. I had them eating out of my hand. I was top dog. It was like falling off log at least seemed that way, and -- for the first time I-- okay. The truth is that, yeah, I acted like an old fool and I really was a big joke. And, you know, if HB was look do you think right me --",
        "Bill: Listen to me you are not a joke. You got that? My father is not a joke. Now, what happened? Josh came in and found you? Is that what happened?",
        "Billy: Yeah, he took Venezuela away, I embarrassed the company, the family.",
        "Bill: You are not an embarrassment. But I just do not get what happened. I was here earlier tonight I saw you, you were on top of the world. You had those guys eating out of the bottom of your hand. Why tonight? What happened?",
        "Billy: I don't know. I really don't know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Yes, I want Bill to succeed. I always have.",
        "Reva: But at what cost?",
        "Olivia: No price is too high for Bill's happiness.",
        "Reva: His happiness or yours?",
        "Olivia: You ever notice that when your life is in the toilet you stick your nose in others?",
        "Reva: I watched you destroy Josh with your ambitions; I won't sit back watch you do the same thing with Bill.",
        "Olivia: He handles my ambition just fine. He loves me for who I am.",
        "Reva: Who he thinks you are. You'll do whatever you have to get what you want-- even destroy his own father in the process.",
        "Olivia: Back to Billy again?",
        "Reva: Billy deserved a shot.",
        "Olivia: He needs to step aside and make room for someone newer and younger, all right? But maybe that hits a little too close to home for you.",
        "Reva: I will tell what you hits too close to home, me. If I find out you've done anything to destroy those two.",
        "Olivia: What are you going to do? Ban me from Cross Creek? Wait a minute. I own that.",
        "Reva: I accepted you into this family against my better judgment. I tried to be your friend.",
        "Olivia: Sure you did.",
        "Reva: You went from one man to another. Leaving them worse off than when you found them.",
        "Olivia: Thanks for stopping by, Reva. Hi. Where's Bbill?",
        "Ava: He is still with his dad. He had a little bit too much to drink.",
        "Reva: Billy was drinking?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: What are you trying to say to me, Mr. O'Neill?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I could bring you up on charges, real or imaginary, and I would most likely make them stick. But what would be the point?",
        "Edmund: Revenge.",
        "Jeffrey: No, you see trials take so much time and they take so much money. And energy, which is why I'm letting you go.",
        "Edmund: You're letting me go?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah.",
        "Edmund: Just going to let me walk out of here?",
        "Jeffrey: That's right. Bye-bye. There is one condition. I want you out of Cassie's life, and I want you out of Hope's life for good.",
        "Edmund: Are you offering me a deal?",
        "Jeffrey: Best one you'll ever get.",
        "Edmund: That's ludicrous.",
        "Jeffrey: Keeping you out of jail is ludicrous, yeah.",
        "Edmund: I just can't leave.",
        "Jeffrey: Sure you can, Eddie boy. Just go back to San Cristobel where you belong. You can hang out at the palace, just go kick back on the beach have yourself a margarita and watch the girls go by. So, what do you say? We got a deal?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You're lucky Mrs. Chitwood didn't see you. I should have let Mallet haul your butt off to jail and throw you in a cell to rot.",
        "Dinah: You didn't.",
        "Cassie: Because I wanted to hear myself what you did.",
        "Dinah: So you just stayed at the hospital.",
        "Cassie: I tried, but your father the Mayor wouldn't let me.",
        "Dinah: He was just trying to protect me that's all.",
        "Cassie: You are so lucky to have someone like him after everything you've done.",
        "Dinah: I know.",
        "Cassie: You sat here on my couch and we talked about my baby. I believed you when you said that you wanted to change.",
        "Dinah: I did. And I do. But I was fooled, too, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Really?",
        "Dinah: By Edmund. Look, you have every reason to hate me. I don't really like myself very much right now.",
        "Cassie: Why should I believe any of this, Dinah?",
        "Dinah: Because I came here to help you. To tell you about Edmund, to tell you about the baby. And this twisted tale.",
        "Dinah: She's so tiny. What's her name?",
        "Cassie: Hope.",
        "Dinah: You love her so much even though she's not yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Bill, you know, I was drinking water and then all of a sudden I took a sip and I wasn't.",
        "Bill: So what do you mean? Just like that.",
        "Billy: Yeah. Ava brought the glass with the olive thing. You know the olive thing.",
        "Bill: Yeah, I know the olive thing. So what happened? You grabbed the wrong glass?",
        "Billy: No, I never grabbed the wrong glass, but that's what happened.",
        "Bill: It was a mistake, not like you went up to the bar and ordered a drink.",
        "Billy: First one was a mistake--",
        "Bill: You wouldn't have stopped drinking if I didn't show up. Here we go again, right? All right, fine. You know what we do. We call your sponsor. I'll call him. Where's his number?",
        "Billy: It's in my old cell phone.",
        "Bill: At home?",
        "Billy: I threw it out.",
        "Bill: You threw it out. I'm sure you've got it written down some place. Let's find it.",
        "Billy: No.",
        "Bill: What do you mean?",
        "Billy: Look, I'm a drunk. Look, I am a drunk. I've always been a drunk maybe I'm just tired of fighting it.",
        "Bill: Did you just tell me you're tired of fighting it?",
        "Billy: Yeah.",
        "Bill: You're tired of fighting it. It's not an option, Dad. Tired of fighting it. How many times did you tell me if I was too tired of something whether it was out on the football field, classroom, getting up on a horse, I'm too tired you said, Son, that's not an option. Only way you to do it is stay and fight. Don't give up. You know that, you told me that because you know things get better. You knew that. And I'm telling you right now things will get better. And I am not going to let you give up.",
        "Reva: Neither will I. I'll take it from here, Sweetie.",
        "Bill: Reva, I'd just like to stay.",
        "Reva: You know something, he's just a little embarrassed to have you see him like this. But he and I, you know, we're past the embarrassment thing, I think it would be best to maybe just, go home.",
        "Billy: She's right, boy. Go home. Reva Shayne is on the case, everything is okay.",
        "Reva: I'll call you.",
        "Bill: Thanks. I love you, Dad.",
        "Billy: I love you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Call Tracy in Media Relations. I want to approve the press release about Bill before it goes out.",
        "Ava: Maybe I'll leave her a voice mail tonight.",
        "Olivia: Set up a committee from the oil commission.",
        "Ava: Senator Drake. Next Tuesday instead of Wednesday.",
        "Olivia: And if that doesn't fly, rearrange my Wednesday, Bill and Drake should meet, I want to be there.",
        "Ava: You were so confident that Bill's uncle would give him a chance. You must be so relieved.",
        "Olivia: Bill is the best man for the job, Josh made a good decision.",
        "Ava: Too bad about his dad, though.",
        "Olivia: Yeah. You're a young and ambitious woman, aren't you?",
        "Ava: I guess.",
        "Olivia: I mean, you go for things. That's how you got this job, right?",
        "Ava: Bill helped me get the job.",
        "Olivia: You're the one who showed interest.",
        "Ava: I did. Yes, I guess you could say fit in with my goals if that's what you mean.",
        "Olivia: I'm not talking about that. Have a seat. I'm talking about something else. Something more. You weren't rich growing up, were you?",
        "Ava: Far from it.",
        "Olivia: Haven't you ever felt so driven, so passionate about something that you just would stop at nothing to get it?",
        "Ava: I'm sorry, I don't know what you are getting at?",
        "Olivia: Yeah. You know what, forget it. We're finished here. You can go.",
        "Ava: I can stay later if you need me to.",
        "Olivia: That's really not necessary. Thanks.",
        "Ava: You're welcome.",
        "Olivia: Night.",
        "Ava: Bye.",
        "Olivia: Thanks, but no thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: This is a one-time offer, Edmund. Don't be stupid.",
        "Edmund: Leave my family when I've done nothing wrong? I don't think so.",
        "Jeffrey: You're not going to get out of this unscathed.",
        "Edmund: We'll see. Cassie and I have a child together, and I intend to be a good father to Hope.",
        "Jeffrey: You're off to a great start, aren't you?",
        "Mallet: Getting anywhere?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that depends on Mr. Winslow here. Well, Edmund, did we get anywhere?",
        "Edmund: No.",
        "Jeffrey: Too bad. Book him.",
        "Mallet: Any particular charge?",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, take your pick. I'll see you later, Edmund. Unfortunately.",
        "Edmund: You're making a mistake, Mr. O'Neill.",
        "Mallet: Edmund Winslow, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be --",
        "Edmund: So, shut up. You think I've never heard that before?",
        "Mallet: Good. In that case, after you.",
        "Edmund: Wait. Wait. There's some place I'd like to take you first.",
        "Mallet: I have some place I'd like to take you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: ( Coughs ) You know I never meant to hurt you, Cassie. I only did what I did because I loved Edmund so much, that's all.",
        "Cassie: You loved him because he was mine.",
        "Dinah: At first, yeah, in the beginning. But I fell for him and he knew that. And then he used my feelings to take advantage of me.",
        "Cassie: He took advantage of you. You.",
        "Dinah: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: See, all this doesn't tell me why you pretended to be pregnant, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: Because I lost your baby and I wanted to deliver a healthy baby girl. I did. And I guess nothing really worked out that way.",
        "Cassie: Why did you pretend?",
        "Dinah: To keep Edmund on the hook. I thought if I could get pregnant and give him a child of our own--",
        "Cassie: Man, that's sweet. Yeah.",
        "Dinah: I know how pathetic this sounds. I think I thought I was going to make him happy, but he loved you. And he made me think that he hated you. And he made me promise if I could just keep on faking it, that we could be together in nine months.",
        "Cassie: So you just went along with it.",
        "Dinah: Well, you see, I trusted him. Until the end.",
        "Edmund: And then you bailed on him. And then he went and bought a baby on the black market.",
        "Dinah: Black market, is that what he told you?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, because you know, babies just don't fall out of the air.",
        "Dinah: No. No, they don't. She's so beautiful.",
        "Dinah: She's so tiny. What's her name?",
        "Cassie: Hope. I loved her from the minute Edmund put her in my arms.",
        "Dinah: Even after you found out what he did?",
        "Cassie: What you both did. No, I didn't stop loving her. Not one bit.",
        "Dinah: Well, I was adopted, and I guess I wish that someone would say that about me so...",
        "Jeffrey: Hi. What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Cassie: We were chatting. ( Dinah coughing )",
        "Jeffrey: Get any answers?",
        "Cassie: Some.",
        "Jeffrey: Some. Okay, good. Now it's my turn. Come on, you can join your friend Eddie downtown. ( Dinah coughing ) That's not going to work, Dinah. Let's go. Come on!",
        "Cassie: Wait a minute. She was in a fire.",
        "Dinah: I need a drink.",
        "Jeffrey: She can have one drink then she is out of here.",
        "Cassie: We should take her back to Cedars.",
        "Jeffrey: She's going to be fine, Cassie. She's going to be fine. ( Dinah coughing )",

        "Edmund: What are we doing here?",
        "Mallet: I'm hungry, do you mind.",
        "Edmund: As a matter of fact I do.",
        "Mallet: Would you just save it? Okay. We're on my schedule now, therefore I'll be calling the shots because unfortunately I'm stuck with you.",
        "Edmund: Well, take me where I want to go and you can get rid of me and we'll both be much happier.",
        "Mallet: Or not. We kind of got off to a rocky start, didn't we? But I'm beginning to believe that this could be the start of a very beautiful, beautiful relationship. Chip?",
        "Edmund: As much as I love Pringles, no thanks on both accounts.",
        "Mallet: Your loss.",
        "Edmund: Why are you doing this? There's something I want to show you.",
        "Mallet: Save it. I want to pick out a candy bar. Relax, Winslow. I'm in no mood to rush. Whatever it is, it will keep. Do you have any change?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Well, if you are here to lecture me, you better -- your better half beat you to it.",
        "Reva: Ooh. Josh was here.",
        "Billy: Yeah, so I'm thinking everything you're going to say.",
        "Reva: I'm not here to cast stones, Billy.",
        "Billy: Now you're going to throw a couple of pebbles?",
        "Reva: I've been as lost as you are right now. And you know it. I just figured we'd sit here for a while until it was time to go home.",
        "Billy: That's what you thought, huh?",
        "Reva: What I think is that we need each other right about now.",
        "Billy: What happened to us, Reva?",
        "Reva: We're both nuts.",
        "Billy: That's nothing new.",
        "Reva: That's true. Maybe we're both just trying to be something that we're not any more.",
        "Billy: Supposed to get easier when you get old, you're in your prime.",
        "Reva: Doesn't feel much like it. How about you?",
        "Billy: Yeah. What do you think? ( Laughter )",
        "Reva: You look pretty prime to me.",
        "Billy: I know. We just lost it, that's all.",
        "Reva: Oh, no, no, no. I didn't say... what I said was we're lost, not that that we've lost it.",
        "Billy: Same difference.",
        "Reva: No! No, no, no. Did the drink help?",
        "Billy: Yeah. Yeah. It made everything go away until Bill walked in and looked embarrassed. It killed me.",
        "Reva: Hey, I have had people look at me like that my entire life. And that's what keeps me going. I guess we just all have our own addictions, you know. I was thinking if we stick together--",
        "Billy: We'll stick together, what?",
        "Reva: I don't know, Billy. But at least it's better than being alone. Right? Come on. You okay?",
        "Billy: Yeah. Let's go.",
        "Reva: Come here, let me give you a piggyback ride. ( Laughs )",

        "Olivia: Hi. Everything okay with Billy?",
        "Bill: No. He's drinking again.",
        "Olivia: I know. Ava was here, she told me. I'm sorry.",
        "Bill: It's just, I don't get it. 13 years of being clean and sober. And this guy has been through so many rough times. No problems, but one business meeting and he's going to let it all fall apart. I just don't get it.",
        "Olivia: I don't think anyone of us can understand neither one of us have been there. Here.",
        "Bill: What are you doing?",
        "Olivia: I'm not thinking, that's what I was doing.",
        "Bill: I guess not.",
        "Olivia: I just wanted tonight to be about you. You know, I wanted to take your mind off of things.",
        "Bill: I tell you my father's an alcoholic, something that you know, he's drinking again, and all you can think about is business. I just don't understand.",
        "Olivia: Billy is going to beat this. He's going to beat this. He's strong, he's tough. Look, you know what, I feel like you're blaming yourself because Josh gave you the job.",
        "Bill: Well, I --",
        "Olivia: You can't do that. You deserve this chance. You can't let what happened to your father ruin this for you. I mean, this is an amazing opportunity. It's a chance to change our lives and--",
        "Bill: You know what? I left my father with Reva down at the bar. I really think--",
        "Olivia: She can take care of Billy.",
        "Bill: I need to go. It's Bill. Are you going to be there for a while? All right. Good, because I have some questions about what happened to my dad tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: I can take it from here.",
        "Reva: Would you just let me help you, please. Come over here. Easy, sorry. Honey, that was your foot. Here, just stay right there, right there, right there.",
        "Billy: Okay.",
        "Reva: Okay, baby doll, sit down, wait. Yeah. Okay. Okay, honey bun. Oh. How does this feel? Let's get this off, too.",
        "Billy: Good. Thanks. Reva:, You, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Hey, Kirk, it's Olivia Lewis. Sorry to call you so late at home, but I wanted to give you the scoop on Bill's new position at Lewis. Okay. He is heading up the Venezuelan operation. Yes, we're going to be working together, you've seen what we can do. This time it won't be any different. See you.",

        "Bill: My dad left?",
        "Ava: A little while ago. Is he going to be okay?",
        "Bill: Yeah. Hope so. Look, you were here during his meeting, right?",
        "Ava: I've been here all night.",
        "Bill: So then what did he tell you about his drinks?",
        "Ava: Just to put one olive in instead of two so that he'd know which one didn't have alcohol.",
        "Bill: It's what you did, right?",
        "Ava: Yeah.",
        "Bill: Obviously, sure. Okay. What?",
        "Ava: Well I wasn't going to say anything to you because I'm sure that it was an accident.",
        "Bill: That what was an accident?",
        "Ava: I saw Olivia eat one of the olives out of one of the glasses and I think maybe it was the one your dad picked up. I'm sure that she would be horrified, horrified if that's what happened.",
        "Bill: Right, right. Yeah, well, thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Ah. Problem?",
        "Edmund: What do you think?",
        "Mallet: You sure you don't want soda or snack or something?",
        "Edmund: I want to go and send you a truckload of your favorite snacks.",
        "Mallet: Well that's tempting. That sounds like a bribe. You know what? I better pretend like I didn't hear that.",
        "Edmund: You want to close this case, don't you? What are you so afraid of? I promise you it will be worth the trip.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Look, I'm going to call Rick and tell him we're bringing her back to the hospital.",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie, I'm telling you it's not necessary.",

        "Dinah: I need you right now, honey. This is just the way it's got to be, okay? Oh, my, goodness, are you beautiful. Oh, my, goodness, you're beautiful.",

        "Cassie: Dinah took her. Where did she take her?",
