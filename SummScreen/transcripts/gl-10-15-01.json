        "Holly: What? What's going on? \r\n",
        "Buzz: That was Harley's cousin Betty. Well, she's not really a cousin.\r\n\r\n",
        "Holly: Oh, the friend who's driving her from California. \r\n",
        "Buzz: Well, was driving from California. Harley ditched her in a truck\r\n\r\nstop on the interstate. \r\n",
        "Holly: Ditched her? \r\n",
        "Buzz: And she's driving the rest of the way on her own. \r\n",
        "Holly: All by herself? The woman is nine months pregnant. \r\n",
        "Buzz: Right. \r\n",
        "Holly: When is she suppose to be here? \r\n",
        "Buzz: Hours ago. \r\n",
        "Harley: You are perfect. You're perfect. \r\n",
        "Rick: Where is this sheriff with the key? We need to get you to the \r\nhospital, Harley. \r\n",
        "Harley: I say why spend good money at the hospital. We did the hard \r\npart \r\nalready. Thanks to you. And thanks to Aitoro. \r\n",
        "Gus: You're the trooper. \r\n",
        "Harley: Well, I have to be considering you locked us in here. But then \r\nyou \r\nsaved the day by bringing my son into the world and saving his life. Thanks \r\nto his father firm hand and excellent directions. \r\n",

        "Gus: Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing? \r\n",
        "Harley: Well, no, I mean you can't, you know, hold him close, but he \r\ncan \r\nat least touch him. \r\n",
        "Gus: Yeah, I can bring the child into the world, but you don't trust me \r\nwalk \r\na foot? I can handle it. \r\n",
        "Rick: It's okay. It's okay. \r\n",

        "Deputy: Yep. The chief had a duplicate. \r\n",

        "Jack: That's not something a woman should hear. It's bad enough we men\r\n\r\nhave to live it. \r\n",

        "Jack: I do declare the woman has an independent streak. \r\n",

        "Jack: Nearby? \r\n",
        "Reva: Somewhere far away. I met your son, Beau, earlier. He's quite a\r\n\r\nspirited young boy, isn't he? \r\n",
        "Jack: Yes, he is. Full of fire. I know where he gets it from, too. \r\n",
        "Reva: His mother? \r\n",
        "Jack: No, from his grandfather. Beau's mother, Clara, was quiet as a\r\n\r\nchurch mouse, frail as a bird. Childbirth was too much for her, rest her soul.\r\n\r\nShe did not have the constitution. You look as though you expected another \r\nanswer. \r\n",

        "Reva: But you fell in love with both of them. \r\n",

        "Reva: I guess that's true. \r\n",
        "Jack: And what are the chances of being hit twice in the same lifetime?\r\n\r\n",
        "Reva: One in a million. \r\n",

        "Jack: In the war? \r\n",
        "Reva: No, we went our separate ways. But we knew each other from \r\nchildhood, and I guess I always thought that we'd be together. That it was \r\nfate. I guess I still do. But we knew each other from childhood, and I guess I\r\n\r\nalways thought that we'd be together. That it was fate. I guess I still do. \r\n",

        "Customer #2: But we're not done eating. What are you talking about? \r\n",
        "Buzz: No, it's okay. I'll wrap it up. I'll give you some dessert. It \r\nwill all \r\nbe on the house. Okay. I'm sorry. \r\n",

        "Blake: So Rick is driving her, right? So does that mean then Rick was\r\n\r\nthere \r\nfor the delivery. Boy, that man with his baby karma, I'll tell you. But that's\r\n\r\ngood. That's good, that's good. She had a friend there with her. \r\n",
        "Holly: A friend? He's the baby's father. Oh, well, whatever you call \r\nit. \r\nThey will be joined for life. And what brings you here? Picking up dessert? \r\nAnd how are the kids? Whose with the kids? Ross? \r\n",
        "Blake: The nanny. Ross is M.I.A. After I finished location scouting, I\r\n\r\ncalled all over for him and I cannot find him. \r\n",

        "Cassie: First of all, you know, how my childhood was. I grew up not \r\nknowing my parents. You know the whole foster home situation. I mean, \r\nTammy doesn't even know her father. \r\n",
        "Richard: Well, considering the last time that she saw him, he tried to\r\n\r\nkidnap her and it's not a bad thing. \r\n",
        "Cassie: I know. I know, I know. I am glad that Tammy realizes what a\r\n\r\nhorrible person rob is. But she saw it herself first hand, good or bad. No one\r\n\r\nmade that choice for her. \r\n",
        "Richard: Will is going to be able to make that choice as well, you \r\nknow, \r\nfurther down the road and we agreed on that. \r\n",
        "Cassie: He's going to want to know about his father. He is. \r\n",

        "Cassie: What if something happens to Alonzo? I mean, God forbid, he \r\ngets lost at sea in some freak accident. Please... Please don't that something\r\n\r\nlike that won't happen. Because it did to me. When I finally found out who my\r\n\r\nmother was, it was too late. She was gone. And that is the biggest regret of \r\nmy life. \r\n",
        "Richard: I understand. \r\n",
        "Cassie: Well, there's something else that is bothering me... And it's \r\njust \r\nhow you were talking earlier. I just felt like... \r\n",
        "Richard: Like what? \r\n",
        "Cassie: It's like you were trying to rationalize us doing nothing. The \r\nguy \r\nwants to just walk away, let him. Be easier for us. \r\n",
        "Richard: Well, I'm sorry if you feel that way. It's not at all what I \r\nmeant. \r\n",
        "Cassie: I hope not, because that's not at all like you. You have never \r\ntaken \r\nthe easy way out, and neither have I. So if it's awkward or messy reaching out\r\n\r\nto Alonzo, then it is, Richard, because it's the right thing to do. \r\n",
        "Richard: Well, he may still say no. As matter fact, I'm quite certain \r\nthat \r\nhe will. \r\n",
        "Cassie: Okay, fine. Maybe he will. But at least we've given it a try, \r\nright? \r\n",

        "Cassie: You know what? It's really easy to be fearless when you feel \r\nsafe \r\nand you feel loved. And for the first time in my life, I do. Now I'm going to\r\n\r\ngo find Alonzo. \r\n",
        "Richard: Now? \r\n",

        "Richard: Why wouldn't he? \r\n",
        "Mayhew: Forgive me, colonel, but you have already miscalculated \r\nAlonzo's reaction once. You were certain that once he learned that he had a \r\nson that he would want to claim him. But he has no interest in this child. \r\n",
        "Dax: Yet. Alonzo needs time to warm to the idea of being a father and a\r\n\r\nPrince. That's why we must proceed slowly and carefully. \r\n",
        "Mayhew: Pardon me again, but what if you're wrong? The man seems \r\nquite content with the life that he has chosen. Perhaps he's ill-suited for the\r\n\r\ngrave responsibility that you're so determined to force upon him. \r\n",
