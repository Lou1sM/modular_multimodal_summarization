        "Jeffrey: No, no, no. Finish the recovery on \r\nthe laptop first, and then send it back to cedars as soon as possible. \n",
        "Dinah: Okay... ",
        "Jeffrey: Not now. Okay, right. No, no, I want \r\nit all. I want the deleted files, I want unwanted emails, everything. I want to \r\nknow everything about Sandy Foster since he got that computer you got it? All \r\nright, then get back to me. Thanks. ",
        "Dinah: You know copying files is a waste of \r\nmy talent. I offered to be your PR agent, not your indentured slave. ",
        "Jeffrey: Well, sorry about that. Now, pick \r\nthose up. Mrs. Winslow, hi. ",
        "Cassie: Hi. ",
        "Jeffrey: I've been trying to get a hold of \r\nyou. How's Reva? ",
        "Cassie: They sent her home from the hospital. \r\nHow's your new assistant working out? ",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, she's... She's just great. You \r\nknow, she's cheerful, resourceful, takes orders well. She's just a slice of \r\nheaven. ",
        "Cassie: I owe you an apology. I was pretty \r\nupset when I found out that Dinah was going to be working for you, and now I \r\nknow why you did it. ",
        "Jeffrey: Why? Because no one else would work \r\nfor me? ",
        "Cassie: No. You did it for my kids. You did \r\nit to keep us safe. You did it to keep an eye on her, and you did it for me.",
        "\r\n*****************************",
        "Blake: It's kind of hard to imagine that \r\ndeath is the end for a man like our father. ",
        "Michelle: I'm here. What's the big emergency?\r\n",
        "Blake: Hi. ",
        "Sebastian: Michelle, thanks for coming. We \r\nare leaving tonight. ",
        "Michelle: Leaving? ",
        "Sebastian: To collect what my father left for \r\nus. I have chartered a plane to Miami, and from there we are going to board a \r\nprivate yacht. ",
        "Michelle: And where are we going? Oh, you're \r\ngoing to be mysterious about that, huh? ",
        "Sebastian: Well, you want to learn more about \r\nyour mother, right? And you want to respect our father's last wishes, yes? So \r\nget packing. Everything's set. ",
        "Blake: Well, almost everything. We're missing \r\nmy mother. She's not coming. ",
        "Holly: I should have gotten rid of this a \r\nlong time ago--burned it, buried it. But I couldn't let go of it, just like I \r\ncouldn't let go of you. Oh, Roger. I loved you, and I hated you, sometimes both \r\nat once. But this is the day... Today is the day I am letting go of this. I am \r\nputting you to rest forever. Good-bye.",
        "\r\n*****************************",
        "Reva: Hi. ",
        "Ross: Hi. Well, it looks like somebody's \r\ngoing home. ",
        "Reva: Yeah. You know, it's so odd not to be \r\nworried about my backside hanging out. ",
        "Ross: Well, I'm glad you're feeling better \r\nbecause I've got some news. ",
        "Reva: About the accident? ",
        "Ross: Yeah, the police examined the tire \r\nskidmarks at the accident site, and they determined that the driver accelerated \r\nsuddenly, as if he sped up on purpose once he saw Tammy. ",
        "Reva: So then you think it was deliberate?\r\n",
        "Ross: That's now a distinct possibility. Do \r\nyou know anybody who would want to hurt Tammy? ",
        "Reva: You know, what if it wasn't Tammy they \r\nwere after? What if it was Sandy?",
        "JB: Hey buddy, back from the dead?",
        "\r\n*****************************",
        "Sebastian: Chrissy, didn't Holly get my \r\nmessage? ",
        "Blake: Yes, she did, Sebastian, but she's not \r\ncoming because she doesn't trust you. Apparently she doesn't trust anybody that \r\nhad anything to do with our father. ",
        "Sebastian: I understand. Look, I haven't been \r\ncompletely honest with any of you. I was intending to steal from you. \n",
        "Michelle: Well, thanks for sharing. Well, \r\nthis has something to do with those coins, right? That's why you're stalking me?\r\n",
        "Sebastian: I wanted to collect father's \r\nfortune for myself, yes. But then I met you, and Chrissy and Holly, and I \r\ncouldn't go through with it, because I saw why my father loved you so much. And \r\nsuddenly I had something--something more, far more valuable than a fortune.\r\n",
        "Michelle: So you only screw over strangers?\r\n",
        "Sebastian: Something like that but not \r\nanymore. I'm a changed man. So are you coming? ",
        "Michelle: Why not? I'm up for an adventure.\r\n",
        "Blake: Count me in. ",
        "Sebastian: Okay. So we're off together. \r\nItinerary, I don't suppose you'll need to tell Danny. ",
        "Michelle: No, I told you. That's over. \n",
        "Blake: You guys broke up? ",
        "Michelle: And I am going to go pack. I'll \r\nmeet you guys at the airport. ",
        "Sebastian: Okay. How is Ross going to feel \r\nabout all this? ",
        "Blake: We'll see. I'm just sad that my mom is \r\nnot going to come. ",
        "Sebastian: Yeah, so is Roger. ",
        "Blake: It's just too bad because it's like \r\nDad is reaching out from beyond his grave, and she's just ignoring him. \n",
        "Holly: That's it, Roger, done, finished.\r\n",
        "Roger: Let's understand. Let's get something \r\nstraight, I'm your husband. I have certain rights here. ",
        "Holly: Wait, don't! ",
        "Roger: You love me, don't you? ",
        "Holly: \"I care about you, Roger.\" No, please! \r\nDon't. No leave me alone, please. ",
        "Roger: You love him, you love him. You love \r\nhim. ",
        "Holly: Why? Why are you doing this to me? \r\nYou're gone, it's over, it's over now. Don't you hear me?\u00a0 Alone at last. \n",
        "Roger: I feel like a bridegroom, a teenaged \r\nbridegroom. Funny, we still look married. ",
        "Holly: Alone at last. ",
        "Roger: Holly, it feels like the end of the \r\nworld. ",
        "Holly: Why? ",
        "Roger: You could love me again at the end of \r\nthe world. ",
        "Holly: Let me go. Please. I'm just asking \r\nyou. Please let me go.",
        "\r\n*****************************",
        "Cassie: What you've done for me, it's beyond \r\nany of your job descriptions. ",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie, I would... ",
        "Edmund: There you are. ",
        "Cassie: Hey, you're late. ",
        "Edmund: Well, I couldn't help it. ",
        "Cassie: You were saying something? \n",
        "Jeffrey: No, it's... It's not important.\r\n",
        "Cassie: Would you like to join us for dinner?\r\n",
        "Jeffrey: No, thank you. I've got a meeting I \r\ngot to get to. ",
        "Cassie: Okay. ",
        "Jeffrey: So I'll see you later. I can't leave \r\nher alone for one second. Dinah, what in the blazes are you doing with... \r\nAssistant Director Reynolds? ",
        "Reynolds: Agent O'Neill. Your beautiful \r\nassistant here was giving me all the dirt on you. ",
        "Jeffrey: Oh? ",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I was just telling Bob what a \r\nchameleon you are, and how many personalities you have and you can just go right \r\ninto them in a drop of a hat. (Laughter) it's amazing how your bosses in D.C. \r\nDon't know this about you. ",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. ",
        "Reynolds: Will you excuse us for a moment?\r\n",
        "Dinah: Certainly. ",
        "Reynolds: Well, you did it. ",
        "Jeffrey: I'm afraid I don't understand.\r\n",
        "Reynolds: The Salerno case. It was a \r\nslam-dunk, put you right over the edge for that London post, the job you've \r\nalways wanted. ",
        "Jeffrey: Oh. Oh, yeah, that. Well, that's \r\ngreat, but... ",
        "Reynolds: But nothing. Pack your bags. You \r\nleave tonight. ",
        "Jeffrey: I can't leave Springfield right now.\r\n",
        "Reynolds: Why not? ",
        "Jeffrey: Because I'm helping a friend. I'm \r\nhelping someone find a friend, I should say, which is why I'm going to turn in \r\nmy resignation, actually. ",
        "Reynolds: You can't be serious. Hey, wait a \r\nminute. Princess Cassie lives here. Now, this isn't because... ",
        "Jeffrey: I don't know what you're \r\ninsinuating, Reynolds, but I wish you would drop it. I just need some time; \r\nthat's all. ",
        "Reynolds: Oh. Well, D.C. won't be the same \r\nwithout you. If you should change your mind... ",
        "Jeffrey: I won't, I won't. But thank you.\r\n",
        "Dinah: That seemed very hush-hush. \n",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I'll save you the snooping. I \r\njust resigned so that I could devote more time to the D.A.'s office. ",
        "Dinah: So now you can settle down in the \r\nvine-covered cottage with the sheepdog and Cassie. Will you just admit it? You \r\nwant her. There's only one thing standing in your way. ",
        "Jeffrey: I think you have work to do. \n",
        "Dinah: It's wrong timing, Jeffrey. You look \r\nlike the wrong brother. ",
        "Edmund: I hate to see you so set. ",
        "Cassie: I'm just worried about Tammy. You \r\nknow, she hasn't been herself since the accident. She feels so guilty about \r\nSandy. ",
        "Edmund: Well, it's survivor's guilt. She'll \r\nbe fine once Sandy is up and around. ",
        "Cassie: I want to do something for her--maybe \r\ntake her away. Maybe I can just take her somewhere for a while. ",
        "Edmund: Somewhere far, far away from the \r\nyoung thug she's taken up with.",
        "\r\n*****************************",
        "Tammy: Sandy, it's okay. It's going to be all \r\nright. The transplant went well. The doctor said so. Oh, this is JB ... JB, this \r\nis my cousin, Sandy. ",
        "JB: I have been dying to meet you. Tammy's \r\ntold me so much about you that I feel like I already know you. I mean, what can \r\nyou say to the guy who saved your girl, huh? ",
        "Tammy: Sandy, you're my hero. You really are.\r\n",
        "JB: Man, it's amazing to think that in the \r\nmoment of danger you would put yourself on the line to save another person with \r\nno thought at all for yourself. Not everyone would do that. ",
        "Tammy: It's okay, Sandy. You're okay. \n",
        "JB: Maybe we should go outside and let him \r\nget some rest. ",
        "Tammy: I think I'd like to spend some time \r\nalone with him, actually, if that's okay. ",
        "JB: Okay, beautiful. I'll see you outside. \r\nHey, nice to meet you, Sandy. ",
        "Tammy: I know he's kind of rough looking, but \r\nhe's a good guy, Sandy. I like him a lot. Sandy, no. ",
        "Reva: I'm going to go back to the house and \r\ncheck Sandy's things. I mean, if there were threats, then maybe there's \r\nsomething there that can help. ",
        "Ross: Reva, you're still recovering. Why \r\ndon't you just let the police handle it? ",
        "JB: You miss me? ",
        "Nurse: You are such a player. ",
        "JB: Play with me then. ",
        "Nurse: Okay, all right. Okay, I'll try.\r\n",
        "Reva: ??? Sandy's room. If I find anything \r\nimportant, I'll let the cops know or I'll call Jeffrey O'Neill. ",
        "Ross: You're recovering from major surgery. \r\nIf you do too much, you're going to end up back in the hospital. Why don't you \r\njust let the police finish this? Reva, I'm sorry. I have to go. ",
        "Reva: Is it about the accident? ",
        "Ross: It's about another accident, and it's \r\njust waiting to happen. I'll call you later tonight. ",
        "Reva: Okay. Thanks. ",
        "Nurse: Hello, where do you think you're \r\ngoing? ",
        "Reva: I've been released. I was going home.\r\n",
        "Nurse: Not until you take your pills. Last \r\ndose. ",
        "Reva: More? Happy? ",
        "Nurse: Perfect. ",
        "Reva: Okay. ",
        "Nurse: Bye now. ",
        "Reva: Thanks. ",
        "Tammy: Sandy, the nurse is just trying to \r\nprotect you. Your breathing wasn't so good, and this helps you. Who's that?\r\n",
        "JB: Oh, nobody. I'm only looking at you, and \r\npack.",
        "\r\n*****************************",
        "Sebastian: Chrissy, wait a minute. I never \r\nhad a sister or much of anybody actually, and sometimes... Sometimes I do things \r\nI don't even understand why. ",
        "Blake: Yeah? You said that before. \n",
        "Sebastian: I know. I know, but if Dad was \r\nalive he would be furious with me that I even thought about taking something \r\naway from you. I'm sorry. ",
        "Blake: Well, I wish you had been straight \r\nwith me from the beginning, but I'm certainly not one to pass judgment on you.\u00a0 \r\nApparently lying runs in this family. ",
        "Sebastian: I'm going to have to remember \r\nthat. ",
        "Blake: Consider yourself warned. ",
        "Sebastian: All right. Well, I'd better make \r\nsome phone calls, make sure the yacht is prepared, and tell the captain to \r\nexpect the three of us. ",
        "Holly: Four.",
        "\r\n*****************************",
        "Tony: Okay, hey, I just came by to see if you \r\nwere okay, and by the looks of things you're throwing shoes--whatever--you're \r\nnot. What's going on? ",
        "Michelle: I'm fine actually, I'm fine. I'm \r\njust getting ready to go on a little mystery tour with Sebastian. ",
        "Tony: Michelle, I don't like that guy at all.\r\n",
        "Michelle: Really? Really? Because I hadn't \r\nnoticed. ",
        "Tony: Where did you say you were going again?\r\n",
        "Michelle: I didn't, because I don't really \r\nknow. ",
        "Tony: Michelle, I don't like this. I don't \r\nwant you to go. ",
        "Michelle: Knock it off, Tony. I don't need \r\nyour approval, all right, or anyone else's. I'm going to do what I want to do, \r\nbrain-damaged and all. ",
        "Tony: You're not brain-damaged. ",
        "Michelle: Yeah, you bet I'm not, all right? \r\nAnd I don't need this. All right? I already kicked Danny out, and I will do the \r\nsame to you if you get in my way. ",
        "Tony: Okay. So what, it really is over?\r\n",
        "Michelle: Look, I gave it my best shot. All \r\nright? I did it for Robbie because it seemed like the right thing to do. And I \r\nalso thought, you know, something great might come out of it, but it wasn't what \r\nI thought it was. So it's good-bye, see you later, sayonara. ",
        "Tony: What happens now, Michelle? Huh? \n",
        "Michelle: Why doesn't anyone just say what \r\nthey mean? Because what you're really asking is what does this mean for us?",
        "\r\n*****************************",
        "Reva: Right before the accident, Sandy was \r\nacting like he was really scared of something, and ... call me back.",
        "\r\n*****************************",
        "Jeffrey: Can I get the check, please? \n",
        "Dinah: Why don't you tell me where you're \r\ngoing? ",
        "Jeffrey: I'm going as far away from you as \r\npossible. ",
        "Dinah: You are too uptight. What you need is \r\na good massage. ",
        "Jeffrey: Dinah. ",
        "Dinah: Yeah, and it would keep your mind off \r\nof Cassie. ",
        "Jeffrey: I'm going to pay the check. You stay \r\nput and be a good little girl. ",
        "Dinah: Why? Being bad is a lot more fun.",
        "\r\n*****************************",
        "JB: Alone at last. So how you feeling, buddy? \r\nHuh? How about that cousin Tammy, huh? She's even cuter than that little chick \r\nme and you both tried to nail in Switzerland. Oh, God. And she's wild about me, \r\ntoo, and so sweet. Innocent. Like a peach. Come here, come here. But all sweet \r\nthings have to turn bad sometimes, with a push from the right person. And you'd \r\nknow all about pushing, wouldn't you? You rest up, buddy, okay? We all need our \r\nsleep. But unlike you, I won't be going to bed alone tonight. Won't be needing \r\nthis, will you? You rest up. Bye, sleepyhead. ",
        "\r\n*****************************",
        "Blake: Oh, Mom, I'm so happy you're coming. \r\nDaddy would be so happy, too. You won't be sorry. ",
        "Holly: We'll see. ",
        "Sebastian: What made you change your mind?\r\n",
        "Holly: I'm hoping that seeing whatever Roger \r\nhas left behind will help me leave him behind, for good. ",
        "Blake: Well, I have to go home and pack.\r\n",
        "Holly: Does Ross know you're going? \n",
        "Blake: I left him a message, which is why I \r\nknow I'm going to get a lecture when I see him, but I'm not going to let him \r\ntalk me out of anything. Not after what he did for Dinah. I mean, my gosh, why \r\nshould I ignore my family when his daughter, the murderer, is running around \r\ntown without a leash?",
        "\r\n*****************************",
        "Dinah: Would it kill you to invite me to \r\ndinner, let's say, and you could have your very favorite dessert. ",
        "Jeffrey: Dinah, I'm warning you. ",
        "Dinah: I will behave, all right. I don't know \r\nif I can vouch, though, for Miss Annie Oakley over there. Hello, young lovers. \r\nIt's a beautiful evening, isn't it? ",
        "Cassie: What do you want, Dinah? ",
        "Dinah: Well, I'm here to give a little gift \r\nto celebrate your engagement. My best wishes, of course. ",
        "Cassie: No, thanks. ",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I think she's just trying to \r\nsmooth things over. ",
        "Cassie: Don't defend her, Edmund. ",
        "Edmund: I thought I'd keep the peace for one \r\nevening. ",
        "Dinah: I am not here to cause trouble. \n",
        "Cassie: Yes, you are. Because you thrive off \r\nof trouble the way others thrive off food. You're a leech, Dinah. You're a \r\nblood-sucking parasite who doesn't know when to let go. ",
        "Dinah: Let go of what? ",
        "Cassie: Stop following us around and stop \r\ntrying to insert yourself into every aspect of our lives. And stop walking \r\naround here like you're some saint when you're the furthest thing from it. And \r\nstop whatever it is you have cooked up and planned next and get a grip. \n",
        "Dinah: It was just a bottle of champagne, \r\nCassie. Maybe you're the one that needs to get a grip. (Cell phone ringing)",

        "Tammy: Yeah, and I have a spare key. I guess \r\nI could call him and make sure that he's not over there. ",
        "JB: You guess? Are you having second \r\nthoughts? If you are, no problem. I can drop you off at home. ",

        "Tony: Hey, I don't want anything from you, \r\nMichelle. We're business partners. We need to communicate. ",

        "Tony: Really? ",
        "Michelle: Yeah. ",
        "Tony: Why don't you get over yourself, okay? \r\nBecause I'm here, because, one, we're partners, we work together, and two, \r\nyou've needed me, and don't deny that. ",
