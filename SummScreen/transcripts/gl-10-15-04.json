Finish the recovery on the laptop first, and then send it back to cedars as soon as possible. \n\nDinah: Okay... \nJeffrey: Not now. Okay, right. No, no, I want it all. I want the deleted files, I want unwanted emails, everything. I want to know everything about Sandy Foster since he got that computer you got it? All right, then get back to me. Thanks. \nDinah: You know copying files is a waste of my talent. I offered to be your PR agent, not your indentured slave. \nJeffrey: Well, sorry about that. Now, pick those up. Mrs. Winslow, hi. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: Hi. \nJeffrey: I've been trying to get a hold of you. How's Reva? \nCassie: They sent her home from the hospital. How's your new assistant working out? \nJeffrey: Oh, she's... She's just great. You know, she's cheerful, resourceful, takes orders well. She's just a slice of heaven. \nCassie: I owe you an apology. I was pretty upset when I found out that Dinah was going to be working for you, and now I know why you did it. \nJeffrey: Why? Because no one else would work for me? \nCassie: No. You did it for my kids. You did it to keep us safe. You did it to keep an eye on her, and you did it for me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "*****************************\nBlake: It's kind of hard to imagine that death is the end for a man like our father. \nMichelle: I'm here. What's the big emergency?\nBlake: Hi. \nSebastian: Michelle, thanks for coming. We are leaving tonight. \nMichelle: Leaving? \nSebastian: To collect what my father left for us. I have chartered a plane to Miami, and from there we are going to board a private yacht. \nMichelle: And where are we going? Oh, you're going to be mysterious about that, huh? \nSebastian: Well, you want to learn more about your mother, right? And you want to respect our father's last wishes, yes? So get packing. Everything's set. \nBlake: Well, almost everything. We're missing my mother. She's not coming. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Holly: I should have gotten rid of this a long time ago--burned it, buried it. But I couldn't let go of it, just like I couldn't let go of you. Oh, Roger. I loved you, and I hated you, sometimes both at once. But this is the day... Today is the day I am letting go of this. I am putting you to rest forever. Good-bye.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "*****************************\nReva: Hi. \nRoss: Hi. Well, it looks like somebody's going home. \nReva: Yeah. You know, it's so odd not to be worried about my backside hanging out. \nRoss: Well, I'm glad you're feeling better because I've got some news. \nReva: About the accident? \nRoss: Yeah, the police examined the tire skidmarks at the accident site, and they determined that the driver accelerated suddenly, as if he sped up on purpose once he saw Tammy. \nReva: So then you think it was deliberate?\nRoss: That's now a distinct possibility. Do you know anybody who would want to hurt Tammy? \nReva: You know, what if it wasn't Tammy they were after? What if it was Sandy?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "JB: Hey buddy, back from the dead?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "*****************************\nSebastian: Chrissy, didn't Holly get my message? \nBlake: Yes, she did, Sebastian, but she's not coming because she doesn't trust you. Apparently she doesn't trust anybody that had anything to do with our father. \nSebastian: I understand. Look, I haven't been completely honest with any of you. I was intending to steal from you. \n\nMichelle: Well, thanks for sharing. Well, this has something to do with those coins, right? That's why you're stalking me?\nSebastian: I wanted to collect father's fortune for myself, yes. But then I met you, and Chrissy and Holly, and I couldn't go through with it, because I saw why my father loved you so much. And suddenly I had something--something more, far more valuable than a fortune.\nMichelle: So you only screw over strangers?\nSebastian: Something like that but not anymore. I'm a changed man. So are you coming? \nMichelle: Why not? I'm up for an adventure.\nBlake: Count me in. \nSebastian: Okay. So we're off together. Itinerary, I don't suppose you'll need to tell Danny. \nMichelle: No, I told you. That's over. \n\nBlake: You guys broke up? \nMichelle: And I am going to go pack. I'll meet you guys at the airport. \nSebastian: Okay. How is Ross going to feel about all this? \nBlake: We'll see. I'm just sad that my mom is not going to come. \nSebastian: Yeah, so is Roger. \nBlake: It's just too bad because it's like Dad is reaching out from beyond his grave, and she's just ignoring him. \n", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Holly: That's it, Roger, done, finished.\nRoger: Let's understand. Let's get something straight, I'm your husband. I have certain rights here. \nHolly: Wait, don't! \nRoger: You love me, don't you? \nHolly: \"I care about you, Roger.\" No, please! Don't. No leave me alone, please. \nRoger: You love him, you love him. You love him. \nHolly: Why? Why are you doing this to me? You're gone, it's over, it's over now. Don't you hear me?\u00a0 Alone at last. \n\nRoger: I feel like a bridegroom, a teenaged bridegroom. Funny, we still look married. \nHolly: Alone at last. \nRoger: Holly, it feels like the end of the world. \nHolly: Why? \nRoger: You could love me again at the end of the world. \nHolly: Let me go. Please. I'm just asking you. Please let me go.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "*****************************\nCassie: What you've done for me, it's beyond any of your job descriptions. \nJeffrey: Cassie, I would... \nEdmund: There you are. \nCassie: Hey, you're late. \nEdmund: Well, I couldn't help it. \nCassie: You were saying something? \n\nJeffrey: No, it's... It's not important.\nCassie: Would you like to join us for dinner?\nJeffrey: No, thank you. I've got a meeting I got to get to. \nCassie: Okay. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: So I'll see you later. I can't leave her alone for one second. Dinah, what in the blazes are you doing with... Assistant Director Reynolds? \nReynolds: Agent O'Neill. Your beautiful assistant here was giving me all the dirt on you. \nJeffrey: Oh? \nDinah: Yeah, I was just telling Bob what a chameleon you are, and how many personalities you have and you can just go right into them in a drop of a hat. (Laughter) it's amazing how your bosses in D.C. Don't know this about you. \nJeffrey: Yeah. \nReynolds: Will you excuse us for a moment?\nDinah: Certainly. \nReynolds: Well, you did it. \nJeffrey: I'm afraid I don't understand.\nReynolds: The Salerno case. It was a slam-dunk, put you right over the edge for that London post, the job you've always wanted. \nJeffrey: Oh. Oh, yeah, that. Well, that's great, but... \nReynolds: But nothing. Pack your bags. You leave tonight. \nJeffrey: I can't leave Springfield right now.\nReynolds: Why not? \nJeffrey: Because I'm helping a friend. I'm helping someone find a friend, I should say, which is why I'm going to turn in my resignation, actually. \nReynolds: You can't be serious. Hey, wait a minute. Princess Cassie lives here. Now, this isn't because... \nJeffrey: I don't know what you're insinuating, Reynolds, but I wish you would drop it. I just need some time; that's all. \nReynolds: Oh. Well, D.C. won't be the same without you. If you should change your mind... \nJeffrey: I won't, I won't. But thank you.\nDinah: That seemed very hush-hush. \n\nJeffrey: Well, I'll save you the snooping. I just resigned so that I could devote more time to the D.A.'s office. \nDinah: So now you can settle down in the vine-covered cottage with the sheepdog and Cassie. Will you just admit it? You want her. There's only one thing standing in your way. \nJeffrey: I think you have work to do. \n\nDinah: It's wrong timing, Jeffrey. You look like the wrong brother. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: I hate to see you so set. \nCassie: I'm just worried about Tammy. You know, she hasn't been herself since the accident. She feels so guilty about Sandy. \nEdmund: Well, it's survivor's guilt. She'll be fine once Sandy is up and around. \nCassie: I want to do something for her--maybe take her away. Maybe I can just take her somewhere for a while. \nEdmund: Somewhere far, far away from the young thug she's taken up with.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "*****************************\nTammy: Sandy, it's okay. It's going to be all right. The transplant went well. The doctor said so. Oh, this is JB ... JB, this is my cousin, Sandy. \nJB: I have been dying to meet you. Tammy's told me so much about you that I feel like I already know you. I mean, what can you say to the guy who saved your girl, huh? \nTammy: Sandy, you're my hero. You really are.\nJB: Man, it's amazing to think that in the moment of danger you would put yourself on the line to save another person with no thought at all for yourself. Not everyone would do that. \nTammy: It's okay, Sandy. You're okay. \n\nJB: Maybe we should go outside and let him get some rest. \nTammy: I think I'd like to spend some time alone with him, actually, if that's okay. \nJB: Okay, beautiful. I'll see you outside. Hey, nice to meet you, Sandy. \nTammy: I know he's kind of rough looking, but he's a good guy, Sandy. I like him a lot. Sandy, no. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: I'm going to go back to the house and check Sandy's things. I mean, if there were threats, then maybe there's something there that can help. \nRoss: Reva, you're still recovering. Why don't you just let the police handle it? \nJB: You miss me? \nNurse: You are such a player. \nJB: Play with me then. \nNurse: Okay, all right. Okay, I'll try.\nReva: ??? Sandy's room. If I find anything important, I'll let the cops know or I'll call Jeffrey O'Neill. \nRoss: You're recovering from major surgery. If you do too much, you're going to end up back in the hospital. Why don't you just let the police finish this? Reva, I'm sorry. I have to go. \nReva: Is it about the accident? \nRoss: It's about another accident, and it's just waiting to happen. I'll call you later tonight. \nReva: Okay. Thanks. \nNurse: Hello, where do you think you're going? \nReva: I've been released. I was going home.\nNurse: Not until you take your pills. Last dose. \nReva: More? Happy? \nNurse: Perfect. \nReva: Okay. \nNurse: Bye now. \nReva: Thanks. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: Sandy, the nurse is just trying to protect you. Your breathing wasn't so good, and this helps you. Who's that?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "JB: Oh, nobody. I'm only looking at you, and pack.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "*****************************\nSebastian: Chrissy, wait a minute. I never had a sister or much of anybody actually, and sometimes... Sometimes I do things I don't even understand why. \nBlake: Yeah? You said that before. \n\nSebastian: I know. I know, but if Dad was alive he would be furious with me that I even thought about taking something away from you. I'm sorry. \nBlake: Well, I wish you had been straight with me from the beginning, but I'm certainly not one to pass judgment on you.\u00a0 Apparently lying runs in this family. \nSebastian: I'm going to have to remember that. \nBlake: Consider yourself warned. \nSebastian: All right. Well, I'd better make some phone calls, make sure the yacht is prepared, and tell the captain to expect the three of us.

What's going on? \nMichelle: I'm fine actually, I'm fine. I'm just getting ready to go on a little mystery tour with Sebastian. \nTony: Michelle, I don't like that guy at all.\nMichelle: Really? Really? Because I hadn't noticed. \nTony: Where did you say you were going again?\nMichelle: I didn't, because I don't really know. \nTony: Michelle, I don't like this. I don't want you to go. \nMichelle: Knock it off, Tony. I don't need your approval, all right, or anyone else's. I'm going to do what I want to do, brain-damaged and all. \nTony: You're not brain-damaged. \nMichelle: Yeah, you bet I'm not, all right? And I don't need this. All right? I already kicked Danny out, and I will do the same to you if you get in my way. \nTony: Okay. So what, it really is over?\nMichelle: Look, I gave it my best shot. All right? I did it for Robbie because it seemed like the right thing to do. And I also thought, you know, something great might come out of it, but it wasn't what I thought it was. So it's good-bye, see you later, sayonara. \nTony: What happens now, Michelle? Huh? \n\nMichelle: Why doesn't anyone just say what they mean? Because what you're really asking is what does this mean for us?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "*****************************\nReva: Right before the accident, Sandy was acting like he was really scared of something, and ... call me back.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "*****************************\nJeffrey: Can I get the check, please? \n\nDinah: Why don't you tell me where you're going? \nJeffrey: I'm going as far away from you as possible. \nDinah: You are too uptight. What you need is a good massage. \nJeffrey: Dinah. \nDinah: Yeah, and it would keep your mind off of Cassie. \nJeffrey: I'm going to pay the check. You stay put and be a good little girl. \nDinah: Why? Being bad is a lot more fun.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "*****************************\nJB: Alone at last. So how you feeling, buddy? Huh? How about that cousin Tammy, huh? She's even cuter than that little chick me and you both tried to nail in Switzerland. Oh, God. And she's wild about me, too, and so sweet. Innocent. Like a peach. Come here, come here. But all sweet things have to turn bad sometimes, with a push from the right person. And you'd know all about pushing, wouldn't you? You rest up, buddy, okay? We all need our sleep. But unlike you, I won't be going to bed alone tonight. Won't be needing this, will you? You rest up. Bye, sleepyhead.

You won't be sorry. \nHolly: We'll see. \nSebastian: What made you change your mind?\nHolly: I'm hoping that seeing whatever Roger has left behind will help me leave him behind, for good. \nBlake: Well, I have to go home and pack.\nHolly: Does Ross know you're going? \n\nBlake: I left him a message, which is why I know I'm going to get a lecture when I see him, but I'm not going to let him talk me out of anything. Not after what he did for Dinah. I mean, my gosh, why should I ignore my family when his daughter, the murderer, is running around town without a leash?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "*****************************\nDinah: Would it kill you to invite me to dinner, let's say, and you could have your very favorite dessert. \nJeffrey: Dinah, I'm warning you. \nDinah: I will behave, all right. I don't know if I can vouch, though, for Miss Annie Oakley over there. Hello, young lovers. It's a beautiful evening, isn't it? \nCassie: What do you want, Dinah? \nDinah: Well, I'm here to give a little gift to celebrate your engagement. My best wishes, of course. \nCassie: No, thanks. \nEdmund: Cassie, I think she's just trying to smooth things over. \nCassie: Don't defend her, Edmund. \nEdmund: I thought I'd keep the peace for one evening. \nDinah: I am not here to cause trouble. \n\nCassie: Yes, you are. Because you thrive off of trouble the way others thrive off food. You're a leech, Dinah. You're a blood-sucking parasite who doesn't know when to let go. \nDinah: Let go of what? \nCassie: Stop following us around and stop trying to insert yourself into every aspect of our lives. And stop walking around here like you're some saint when you're the furthest thing from it. And stop whatever it is you have cooked up and planned next and get a grip. \n\nDinah: It was just a bottle of champagne, Cassie. Maybe you're the one that needs to get a grip.

Can you get over here right away? \nReva: Of course, Tammy. Of course I can.\nTammy: Okay. Well, hurry. \nJB: Things are really looking up for your family, huh? \nTammy: Finally. \nJB: I think this calls for a celebration, don't you? \nTammy: Definitely. Got any ideas? \nSandy: Nurse. \nJB: I want to be with you, Tammy. And I think you want to be with me. \nTammy: But where can we go? \nJB: Didn't you say that Edmund keeps a hotel suite that he never uses? \nTammy: Yeah, and I have a spare key. I guess I could call him and make sure that he's not over there. \nJB: You guess? Are you having second thoughts? If you are, no problem. I can drop you off at home. \nTammy: No. I don't want to go home. Let's go.\n*****************************\nReva: No, no, no, no, no. Don't do this now. I've got to get to the hospital.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "*****************************\nTony: Hey, Michelle, will you stop for one second please and talk to me? You're moving around all over the place. Talk to me. \nMichelle: Because I'm focusing, Tony, all right? On what I want. You know, you and Danny and Sebastian, you guys all are working me, trying to get something. \nTony: Hey, I don't want anything from you, Michelle. We're business partners. We need to communicate. \nMichelle: All right, well, here's a little communication for you: Back off, because I'm going on this trip and you can't stop me. \nTony: Okay, you know what? Fine. You go and you do whatever. I could care less what you do, Michelle. Really. \nMichelle: That is so not true. I see the way you look at me. \nTony: Really? \nMichelle: Yeah. \nTony: Why don't you get over yourself, okay? Because I'm here, because, one, we're partners, we work together, and two, you've needed me, and don't deny that. \nMichelle: Well, I don't need to be saved anymore, all right? See, if I have an impulse now or a wish or a freakin' whim, I'm going to act on it and I don't care if it hurts somebody or offends them, because I'm going to live, Tony, and to hell with the consequences. \nTony: Go live, Michelle.

Just... Let me talk first. \nRoss: Okay. \nBlake: I know you're about to give me a dissertation on the evils of my wicked half-brother, all right? And that how I don't know what I'm doing, I don't think before I act and this trip is too dangerous and I should stay home where I belong, but I've made my decision, Ross. \nRoss: Yes, I know that and you're leaving. I just need to get the kids' schedule straight so I can figure out how to handle things while you're gone. \nBlake: That's it? \nRoss: Yeah, that's it. Now, Clarissa has a ballet lesson, but I don't know if it's Thursday or Friday. And the boys have a soccer game, but is it home or away? \nBlake: Well, I can write that down. Oh, Ross. Ross, thank you so much. Oh, honey, I thought for sure you were going to say, \"Blake, are you out of your skull? What are you doing?\" \nRoss: Oh, no, no, no. I wouldn't dream of doing that. I mean, once you get something in this pretty little head of yours, it's impossible to get it out. \nBlake: I could just kiss you all day. \n\nRoss: You know, that could be arranged.\nBlake: Ross? Do you remember the last time we were in a jail cell? \nRoss: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I remember. They say parting is such sweet sorrow.

Richard, we had this beautiful child together and then we abandoned him, and now I've hurt two boys. \nJeffrey: Reva, Reva. Shh. Now, listen to me. You sent me a message, all right? You said that Sandy was afraid of somebody. Do you know who that might be? \nReva: Richard. Call Marissa. \nJeffrey: Marissa? \nReva: Marissa, Olivia's sister, Jonathan's adoptive mother. Maybe if I talk to her, maybe if we work together, we can get our baby back. Just make the call, Richard. Please. \nJeffrey: Okay, okay. (In English accent): I'm... I'm Richard. It's Richard here, okay, Reva? I'm here and everything's going to be all right, okay? You need to lay down. \nReva: Okay. \nJeffrey (in English accent): Okay, let's just lay down right here.

I'm with a patient of yours that just checked out of the hospital, Reva Lewis. Yeah, well, something happened. She may have fainted or something. I'm a little concerned.

Something happened. You may have fainted or something and I called the hospital. Everything's going to be okay. A doctor is on his way, okay? I'm going to try to find your sister, Cassie.
