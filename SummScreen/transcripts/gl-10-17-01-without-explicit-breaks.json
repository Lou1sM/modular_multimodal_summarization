        "Lillian: She\u2019s alive! My baby is alive! Oh, \r\ngod!",
        "Phillip: Wait a minute. Hang on a second. Now \r\nlisten to me. Listen to me. She is alive, but she\u2019s not... She\u2019s not all there. \r\nShe\u2019s lost some of her memory, so she\u2019s a little bit off, but she is alive.",
        "Alan: Now how did she survive the flood, \r\nPhillip?",
        "Phillip: You know what? I\u2019ll let her tell you \r\nthe whole story. They should actually be here any minute. So...",
        "Alan: Wait, they?",
        "Phillip: Yeah, this is the bad part. She\u2019s \r\ncoming with Edmund.",
        "Lillian: What?",
        "Phillip: Yeah, they've reconciled.",
        "Alan: Oh, for God\u2019s sake, the man is a \r\nmurderer!",
        "Lillian: Yeah, I thought he'd kidnapped her.",
        "Phillip: No, no, listen. His story is that \r\nthat they were both abducted together.",
        "Lillian: What does Beth say?",
        "Phillip: Well, at the moment, she\u2019s saying \r\nthat he\u2019s telling the truth. She says that he engineered their escape and that\u2019s \r\nhow they ended up in the desert.",
        "Alan: Wait, wait. That\u2019s impossible.",
        "Phillip: I know, dad. Look, I\u2019m having a hell \r\nof a hard time believing this, too.",
        "Alan: He probably threatened her, Phillip.",
        "Phillip: Well, he may have, he may have, and \r\nyou know what? I don\u2019t care. All I know is that right now my children have their \r\nmother back. She\u2019s backing him up. She\u2019s got no reason to lie.",
        "Alan: None that we know of.",
        "Lillian: We have to believe her. We have to \r\nbelieve her.",
        "Phillip: Yeah.",
        "Lorelei: Mom!",
        "Lillian: Oh, Beth! Oh, God. Beth, oh \r\nsweetheart. Oh, sweetie.",

        "Rick: Uncle Danny?",
        "Michelle: Oh, my gosh. How did you...",
        "Harley: I was until just a few short hours \r\nago.",
        "Michelle: What did you do?",
        "Harley: In a jail cell.",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Harley: Yeah, speed trap in the middle of \r\nnowhere, can you believe it?",
        "Rick: Brewster Falls, to be precise.",
        "Harley: This overzealous cop, he throws me in \r\njail just as my contractions started. Then he loses the key.",
        "Michelle: Loses the key?",
        "Rick: It gets better.",
        "Harley: Yeah, yeah. Just as my water breaks, \r\nboom, he\u2019s out cold.",
        "Michelle: No?",
        "Rick: Aitoro calls me...",
        "Harley: Well, he and Aitoro had mixed up \r\ntheir phones.",
        "Rick: He switched phones and he didn\u2019t tell \r\nme you called.",
        "Harley: But then he redeemed himself by \r\ndelivering the child, which he would not have been able to do if Rick hadn\u2019t \r\nshowed up. And he got there just in time to deliver his own little baby. It was \r\nbeautiful. Really, it was beautiful.",
        "Danny: Congratulations, you guys.",
        "Rick: Thank you.",
        "Danny: Hey, if you want to skip Tony\u2019s party, \r\nif you want to hang with what\u2019s his name?",
        "Harley: Jude.",
        "Danny: Hey, Jude. That was... That had to \r\nhappen.",
        "Michelle: No, no, you know, well, I think the \r\nthree of them probably need to take a nap. And Harley, if you want to crash \r\nhere, you're more than welcome to.",
        "Harley: Funny you should mention that...",
        "Rick: It\u2019s very funny you should say that, \r\nbecause I\u2019ve asked her to stay at the house for a couple of days. Her house is \r\nclearly not ready.",
        "Harley: And I think it would be a great \r\nopportunity for Rick to actually bond with his son.",
        "Michelle: Well, Meta will be thrilled to have \r\ntwo babies to spoil.",
        "Rick: I better get some supplies.",
        "Harley: Diapers.",
        "Rick: Diapers.",

        "Tony: Yeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of.",
        "Romeo: (Whistling) Little something from \r\nCarlos.",

        "Marah: Hello. Well, you are in a good mood.",
        "Sam: Well, see, it\u2019s kind of like this. An \r\nold friend told me to lighten up, chill out, and enjoy what I have.",
        "Marah: Well, if you ever see this old friend \r\nagain, give them a kiss for me.",
        "Sam: Marah?",
        "Marah: Yeah.",
        "Sam: You need a sweater?",
        "Marah: No, I got this really terrible feeling \r\nall of a sudden.",
        "Sam: About what?",
        "Marah: About Tony\u2019s party. I don\u2019t think we \r\nshould go.",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nReva: I didn\u2019t bring anything fancy, so Regina let me borrow this.",
        "Jack: That was very kind of her.",
        "Reva: Thank you for inviting me to dinner.",
        "Jack: My pleasure. You deserve to enjoy \r\nyourself.",
        "Reva: How\u2019s the shoulder?",
        "Jack: Holding up. That is a beautiful dress. \r\nWhy don\u2019t you do a little spin for me?",
        "Reva: Not exactly ripped from the runway, is \r\nit? That\u2019s a term that we use where I come from. But it is a fine dress, and I\u2019m \r\nproud to be wearing it. What?",
        "Jack: This lace rose. It does not belong.",
        "Reva: Better? Colonel Robechaux?",
        "Jack: I\u2019m afraid you caught me off guard, \r\nlooking like that.",
        "Regina: Take this to General Hudson at his \r\nquarters with my compliments. Tell him I look forward to seeing him shortly. Go \r\non.",
        "Girl: Yes, ma'am.",
        "Reva: It must be hard sitting on the \r\nsidelines watching when other people are fighting a battle you feel so strongly \r\nabout.",
        "Jack: My feelings about the war might \r\nsurprise you, Miss Shayne, but I assure you, I am still fighting the battle that \r\nneeds to be fought.",
        "Reva: Oh, of course. I didn\u2019t mean...",
        "Jack: It\u2019s all right. It\u2019s confusing, I know \r\nthat. Like tonight, entertaining a Yankee general right here in my home, and not \r\njust any general, but the beast himself, Mordecai Hudson. Like breaking bread \r\nwith the devil.",
        "Reva: Your wife\u2019s idea?",
        "Jack: My wife is strong-willed, as you've \r\nnoticed, I\u2019m sure. But tonight... Tonight you are not my nurse. Tonight you are \r\nan invited guest in this home. And my only cause that I am concerned with \r\ntonight is your entertainment.",
        "Reva: Well, you're already entertaining me, \r\nbelieve me.Thank you for letting me borrow your dress.",
        "Regina: What? That old thing? I was glad to \r\nput to use. It\u2019s terribly out of fashion, but it suits you.",
        "Jack: I have a fine idea. Perhaps we can show \r\nGeneral Hudson what New Orleans really thinks of him. We will sneak off to the \r\nFrench quarter for dinner....",
        "Regina: Jack...",
        "Jack: ...And leave him here to fend for \r\nhimself. Perhaps he will learn something about the rules of engagement.",
        "Regina: This dinner is about our survival. We \r\nmust align ourselves with the north to save our plantation, and the only way is \r\nto curry favors with that general.",
        "Jack: You! What do you think you're doing?",
        "Horton: Sir, it is my job to safeguard the \r\nGeneral.",
        "Regina: Why, General Hudson, it\u2019s wonderful \r\nfor you to come. It\u2019s our greatest pleasure to service New Orleans' most \r\ndistinguished guest.",
        "Hudson: The pleasure is all mine, I assure \r\nyou. Thank you, Madame. Of all the inhabitants of this fair city, your welcome \r\nhas been the warmest.",
        "Regina: General, you haven\u2019t introduced your \r\nguest.",
        "Hudson: My companion for this evening, Miss \r\nVandergelt, my compatriot, Captain Norton.",
        "Regina: This is Jack\u2019s dedicated nurse, Reva.",
        "Reva: It\u2019s a pleasure to make your \r\nacquaintance.",
        "Hudson: Likewise.",
        "Reva: I understand you are the beast of New \r\nOrleans.",
        "Hudson: Well, the woman speaks her mind. What \r\nelse have you heard?",

        "\r\nLillian: I\u2019m just going to hold you and hold you and never, ever going to let \r\nyou go.",
        "Lorelei: Mom, I\u2019m so glad to see you. I just \r\nmissed you.",
        "Lillian: Oh, sweetheart, you know during that \r\nterrible memorial service we had for you, I kept screaming inside that I didn\u2019t \r\nbelieve you were dead, that you would come back, and now look. You're here.",
        "Alan: I think I have just experienced my \r\nfirst miracle.",
        "Lorelei: Alan...",
        "Lillian: Sweetheart.",
        "Lorelei: Now, Phillip, please. Let\u2019s not turn \r\nthis into a spitting contest. Edmund may not be a saint, but he\u2019s not \r\nresponsible for what happened in Mexico, either. In fact, I owe him my life.",
        "Alan: Of course you do.",
        "Lillian: Honey, we thought you two were \r\nseparated in the flood.",
        "Lorelei: Well, yes, but only after he tried \r\nto warn me.",
        "Lillian: Tell me what happened to you, okay?",
        "Lorelei: Well, I grabbed on to a branch, and \r\nI just held on for dear life, and eventually I was able to drag myself up on to \r\na bank, but like I told Phillip, I must have hit my head on a rock or something, \r\nbecause I just blacked out. And now I get these snapshot memories with big holes \r\nin between.",
        "Phillip: Are you still having the blackouts?",
        "Lorelei: That\u2019s what took me so long to get \r\nhome.",
        "Lillian: Oh, you didn\u2019t know where your home \r\nwas?",
        "Lorelei: But I found my way back. And I found \r\nsomething else, too. It took this whole ordeal to make me realize that I\u2019m meant \r\nto be with Edmund. And I know how hard that is for all of you to accept, but I \r\nhope you'll at least try.",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\nRick: I\u2019m just afraid I\u2019ll never want to go back to work. I love that kid so \r\nmuch. It\u2019s just going to be impossible to tear myself away from him.",
        "Danny: I know the feeling. Michelle? Honey? \r\nCome on, we got to get going.",
        "Rick: Whoa, hot mama. What happened to my \r\nsister?",
        "Michelle: While the resident comedian here is \r\ngrabbing supplies, if you need anything, just ask Meta.",
        "Harley: I\u2019m sure that Meta\u2019s probably got her \r\nhands full with Robbie, but thanks, I will.",

        "Romeo: Hey, what\u2019s up with the attitude? I\u2019m \r\nhere to help you. All you got to do is say the word. If you don\u2019t want to get \r\ninvolved now...",
        "Tony: I am involved, man!",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\nMarah: No, no I mean it. We should skip the party. Hey, let\u2019s go bowling.",
        "Sam: Dressed like this? Come on, Marah, we \r\ntalked about this. We're together now and we want the whole world to know, \r\nright?",
        "Marah: I know. I just... I just have this \r\nhorrible feeling.",
        "Sam: Well, get rid of it. No horrible \r\nfeelings, only good feelings tonight. You look way too beautiful to sit in a \r\ndorm room all night. Miss Lewis, I promise you a night to remember.",
        "Marah: Okay, we'll go.",
        "Sam: That a girl.",

        "Hudson: Oh, too little, too late.",
        "Jack: Your men have already torched our \r\ncrops, damaged our main house. We will rebuild this house with our own money.",

        "Jack: We'll be fine, don\u2019t you worry.",
        "Hudson: Do I look like I\u2019m worried? Word has \r\nit that the Robechaux' resources aren\u2019t what they used to be.",
        "Jack: I invite you into my house against my \r\nbetter judgment; you come swaggering in here, and insult me. I have half a mind \r\nto throw you out on your tail!",
        "Regina: Jack...",
        "Hudson: And I have half a mind to throw you \r\ninto prison, and that is not an empty threat.",
        "Regina: Gentlemen, please. There are more \r\nappropriate topics. General, we have prepared a lovely feast in your honor. \r\nLet\u2019s enjoy it, shall we?",
