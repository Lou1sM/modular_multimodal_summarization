Hang on a second. Now listen to me. Listen to me. She is alive, but she\u2019s not... She\u2019s not all there. She\u2019s lost some of her memory, so she\u2019s a little bit off, but she is alive.\nAlan: Now how did she survive the flood, Phillip?\nPhillip: You know what? I\u2019ll let her tell you the whole story. They should actually be here any minute. So...\nAlan: Wait, they?\nPhillip: Yeah, this is the bad part. She\u2019s coming with Edmund.\nLillian: What?\nPhillip: Yeah, they've reconciled.\nAlan: Oh, for God\u2019s sake, the man is a murderer!\nLillian: Yeah, I thought he'd kidnapped her.\nPhillip: No, no, listen. His story is that that they were both abducted together.\nLillian: What does Beth say?\nPhillip: Well, at the moment, she\u2019s saying that he\u2019s telling the truth. She says that he engineered their escape and that\u2019s how they ended up in the desert.\nAlan: Wait, wait. That\u2019s impossible.\nPhillip: I know, dad. Look, I\u2019m having a hell of a hard time believing this, too.\nAlan: He probably threatened her, Phillip.\nPhillip: Well, he may have, he may have, and you know what? I don\u2019t care. All I know is that right now my children have their mother back. She\u2019s backing him up. She\u2019s got no reason to lie.\nAlan: None that we know of.\nLillian: We have to believe her. We have to believe her.\nPhillip: Yeah.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lorelei: Mom!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lillian: Oh, Beth! Oh, God. Beth, oh sweetheart. Oh, sweetie.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "__________________________________________\nRick: Aunt Michelle?\nHarley: Wake up.\nRick: Uncle Danny?\nMichelle: Oh, my gosh. How did you...\nHarley: I was until just a few short hours ago.\nMichelle: What did you do?\nHarley: In a jail cell.\nDanny: What?\nHarley: Yeah, speed trap in the middle of nowhere, can you believe it?\nRick: Brewster Falls, to be precise.\nHarley: This overzealous cop, he throws me in jail just as my contractions started. Then he loses the key.\nMichelle: Loses the key?\nRick: It gets better.\nHarley: Yeah, yeah. Just as my water breaks, boom, he\u2019s out cold.\nMichelle: No?\nRick: Aitoro calls me...\nHarley: Well, he and Aitoro had mixed up their phones.\nRick: He switched phones and he didn\u2019t tell me you called.\nHarley: But then he redeemed himself by delivering the child, which he would not have been able to do if Rick hadn\u2019t showed up. And he got there just in time to deliver his own little baby. It was beautiful. Really, it was beautiful.\nDanny: Congratulations, you guys.\nRick: Thank you.\nDanny: Hey, if you want to skip Tony\u2019s party, if you want to hang with what\u2019s his name?\nHarley: Jude.\nDanny: Hey, Jude. That was... That had to happen.\nMichelle: No, no, you know, well, I think the three of them probably need to take a nap. And Harley, if you want to crash here, you're more than welcome to.\nHarley: Funny you should mention that...\nRick: It\u2019s very funny you should say that, because I\u2019ve asked her to stay at the house for a couple of days. Her house is clearly not ready.\nHarley: And I think it would be a great opportunity for Rick to actually bond with his son.\nMichelle: Well, Meta will be thrilled to have two babies to spoil.\nRick: I better get some supplies.\nHarley: Diapers.\nRick: Diapers.\nMichelle: I\u2019m so proud of you.\nRick: Why? Why do you say that?\nMichelle: Besides the fact of being a hero, you're going to be a great dad.\nRick: Thanks.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "__________________________________________\nCatalina: There you go. You look fantastic.\nTony: Well, you, you look pretty damn hot yourself.\nCatalina: You're very, very tense. Relax Tony. This is your night. Anything can happen.\nTony: Yeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of.\nRomeo: (Whistling) Little something from Carlos.\nTony: He\u2019s not coming. He wants me to take care of this tonight. Now it\u2019s all on me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "__________________________________________\nSam: (Whistles) Glamour girl. Steaming up the place, look at you.\nMarah: Hello. Well, you are in a good mood.\nSam: Well, see, it\u2019s kind of like this. An old friend told me to lighten up, chill out, and enjoy what I have.\nMarah: Well, if you ever see this old friend again, give them a kiss for me.\nSam: Marah?\nMarah: Yeah.\nSam: You need a sweater?\nMarah: No, I got this really terrible feeling all of a sudden.\nSam: About what?\nMarah: About Tony\u2019s party. I don\u2019t think we should go.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "_________________________________________\nReva: I didn\u2019t bring anything fancy, so Regina let me borrow this.\nJack: That was very kind of her.\nReva: Thank you for inviting me to dinner.\nJack: My pleasure. You deserve to enjoy yourself.\nReva: How\u2019s the shoulder?\nJack: Holding up. That is a beautiful dress. Why don\u2019t you do a little spin for me?\nReva: Not exactly ripped from the runway, is it? That\u2019s a term that we use where I come from. But it is a fine dress, and I\u2019m proud to be wearing it. What?\nJack: This lace rose. It does not belong.\nReva: Better? Colonel Robechaux?\nJack: I\u2019m afraid you caught me off guard, looking like that.\nRegina: Take this to General Hudson at his quarters with my compliments. Tell him I look forward to seeing him shortly. Go on.\nGirl: Yes, ma'am.\nReva: It must be hard sitting on the sidelines watching when other people are fighting a battle you feel so strongly about.\nJack: My feelings about the war might surprise you, Miss Shayne, but I assure you, I am still fighting the battle that needs to be fought.\nReva: Oh, of course. I didn\u2019t mean...\nJack: It\u2019s all right. It\u2019s confusing, I know that. Like tonight, entertaining a Yankee general right here in my home, and not just any general, but the beast himself, Mordecai Hudson. Like breaking bread with the devil.\nReva: Your wife\u2019s idea?\nJack: My wife is strong-willed, as you've noticed, I\u2019m sure. But tonight... Tonight you are not my nurse. Tonight you are an invited guest in this home. And my only cause that I am concerned with tonight is your entertainment.\nReva: Well, you're already entertaining me, believe me.Thank you for letting me borrow your dress.\nRegina: What? That old thing? I was glad to put to use. It\u2019s terribly out of fashion, but it suits you.\nJack: I have a fine idea. Perhaps we can show General Hudson what New Orleans really thinks of him. We will sneak off to the French quarter for dinner....\nRegina: Jack...\nJack: ...And leave him here to fend for himself. Perhaps he will learn something about the rules of engagement.\nRegina: This dinner is about our survival. We must align ourselves with the north to save our plantation, and the only way is to curry favors with that general.\nJack: You! What do you think you're doing?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Horton: Sir, it is my job to safeguard the General.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Regina: Why, General Hudson, it\u2019s wonderful for you to come. It\u2019s our greatest pleasure to service New Orleans' most distinguished guest.\nHudson: The pleasure is all mine, I assure you. Thank you, Madame. Of all the inhabitants of this fair city, your welcome has been the warmest.\nRegina: General, you haven\u2019t introduced your guest.\nHudson: My companion for this evening, Miss Vandergelt, my compatriot, Captain Norton.\nRegina: This is Jack\u2019s dedicated nurse, Reva.\nReva: It\u2019s a pleasure to make your acquaintance.\nHudson: Likewise.\nReva: I understand you are the beast of New Orleans.\nHudson: Well, the woman speaks her mind. What else have you heard?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "__________________________________________\nLillian: I\u2019m just going to hold you and hold you and never, ever going to let you go.\nLorelei: Mom, I\u2019m so glad to see you. I just missed you.\nLillian: Oh, sweetheart, you know during that terrible memorial service we had for you, I kept screaming inside that I didn\u2019t believe you were dead, that you would come back, and now look. You're here.\nAlan: I think I have just experienced my first miracle.\nLorelei: Alan...\nLillian: Sweetheart.\nLorelei: Now, Phillip, please. Let\u2019s not turn this into a spitting contest. Edmund may not be a saint, but he\u2019s not responsible for what happened in Mexico, either. In fact, I owe him my life.\nAlan: Of course you do.\nLillian: Honey, we thought you two were separated in the flood.\nLorelei: Well, yes, but only after he tried to warn me.\nLillian: Tell me what happened to you, okay?\nLorelei: Well, I grabbed on to a branch, and I just held on for dear life, and eventually I was able to drag myself up on to a bank, but like I told Phillip, I must have hit my head on a rock or something, because I just blacked out. And now I get these snapshot memories with big holes in between.\nPhillip: Are you still having the blackouts?\nLorelei: That\u2019s what took me so long to get home.\nLillian: Oh, you didn\u2019t know where your home was?\nLorelei: But I found my way back. And I found something else, too. It took this whole ordeal to make me realize that I\u2019m meant to be with Edmund. And I know how hard that is for all of you to accept, but I hope you'll at least try.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "___________________________________________\nRick: I\u2019m just afraid I\u2019ll never want to go back to work. I love that kid so much. It\u2019s just going to be impossible to tear myself away from him.\nDanny: I know the feeling. Michelle? Honey? Come on, we got to get going.\nRick: Whoa, hot mama. What happened to my sister?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: While the resident comedian here is grabbing supplies, if you need anything, just ask Meta.\nHarley: I\u2019m sure that Meta\u2019s probably got her hands full with Robbie, but thanks, I will.\nMichelle: Oh, the present\u2019s in the living room. (Knock on door)\nHarley: Who is it?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "__________________________________________\nRomeo: So how are we going to make sure Sam doesn\u2019t shoot off his mouth to Marah and connect us to the harbor project?\nTony: Hey, look, I know what I have to do, all right? And I don\u2019t need anybody breathing down my neck!\nRomeo: Hey, what\u2019s up with the attitude? I\u2019m here to help you. All you got to do is say the word. If you don\u2019t want to get involved now...\nTony: I am involved, man!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "___________________________________________\nMarah: No, no I mean it. We should skip the party. Hey, let\u2019s go bowling.\nSam: Dressed like this? Come on, Marah, we talked about this. We're together now and we want the whole world to know, right?\nMarah: I know. I just... I just have this horrible feeling.\nSam: Well, get rid of it. No horrible feelings, only good feelings tonight. You look way too beautiful to sit in a dorm room all night. Miss Lewis, I promise you a night to remember.\nMarah: Okay, we'll go.\nSam: That a girl.\nMarah: Only if you promise me that we'll go back to the dorm room afterward so we can be alone.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "___________________________________________\nHudson: Rumor has it your plantation has fallen on hard times.\nRegina: Well, after the war, things were hard.\nHudson: Oh, too little, too late.\nJack: Your men have already torched our crops, damaged our main house. We will rebuild this house with our own money.\nHudson: Confederate currency isn\u2019t worth the paper it\u2019s printed on.\nJack: We'll be fine, don\u2019t you worry.\nHudson: Do I look like I\u2019m worried? Word has it that the Robechaux' resources aren\u2019t what they used to be.\nJack: I invite you into my house against my better judgment; you come swaggering in here, and insult me. I have half a mind to throw you out on your tail!\nRegina: Jack...\nHudson: And I have half a mind to throw you into prison, and that is not an empty threat.\nRegina: Gentlemen, please. There are more appropriate topics. General, we have prepared a lovely feast in your honor. Let\u2019s enjoy it, shall we?\nJack: Ma'am.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "__________________________________________\nLillian: I thought you were gone forever, honey. And now that you're back, I don\u2019t want to lose you again. So if that means you want me to accept Edmund, of course. I\u2019ll do anything you want. I\u2019ll accept Edmund.\nAlan: God give me strength.\nPhillip: You know what? I\u2019m going to go get Lizzie.\nLorelei: Okay.\nPhillip: Dad, join me, please.\nLillian: You're going to see James.\nLorelei: Mother, could you get me a cup of tea?

I have never seen a more beautiful place in my whole life. Hey, hey, I want to ask you something. Ain\u2019t that... Ain\u2019t that what they call that art nouveau or art deco, or something?\nEdmund: Don\u2019t point. And if it takes an exorcism, we will strike the word \"ain\u2019t\" from your vocabulary.\nLorelei: Relax. I see why you put me through boot camp. And I want to let you know something-- I appreciate it.\nEdmund: Well, you're about to depreciate and rather quickly, I might add, if you don\u2019t pass this next test.\nLorelei: What\u2019s that?\nEdmund: The children. You have to be extremely careful, especially with Lizzie. There is no fooling an innocent.\nLorelei: Could you speak in English, please?\nEdmund: No one will see through you more quickly than a child, and you're about to come face-to-face with your own daughter, which means you have to play this to make her believe you are Beth.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "__________________________________________\n(Latin music playing)\nMichelle: Hey! Happy birthday.\nTony: Thanks.\nDanny: Getting old, man. Catching up with me.

Tony, lighten up. Seriously, I mean, if we can\u2019t be in the same room together without arguing...\nTony: Then we can\u2019t be in the same room together.\nDanny: What the hell is his problem? I mean, what did I say? I didn\u2019t say anything.\nMichelle: I\u2019m sure he\u2019s just nervous, you know, big party, big expectations.\nDanny: Whatever. Let\u2019s just eat and get out of here.

What\u2019s up, Tony?\nTony: It\u2019s like you say, I\u2019m the man now. I got some tough choices to make, so...\nRay: Well, they're usually not so tough once you weigh the good and the bad. Want to talk about it?\nTony: No. Maybe. I don\u2019t know, Ray. Maybe.\nRay: Listen, whatever\u2019s bothering you, trust your gut.

No, I\u2019m not your hero, and I\u2019ve been lying all the time?\" No, I didn\u2019t say that.\nCatalina: Sam... Sam, you're a good, good guy. You deserve to be Marah\u2019s hero.

See, you didn\u2019t go back there trolling for clients. Uh-uh. You went back there because you helped me deliver my child there, and I think...

We're nowhere near a movie theater, yet I detect a scent of butter. Come on, out with it.\nRick: All right. Can you cover for me in E.R? Just for a few days.\nMel: That\u2019s it? The big wind-up?\nRick: A week.\nMel: Whatever you need.\nRick: Two weeks?\nMel: Okay, now you're pushing it. So, what did you name the baby?\nRick: His name is Jude.\nMel: Solid. Biblical. I like it.\nRick: Well, actually Harley came up with it. It was one of her favorite songs, something like that. Oh, by the way, I haven\u2019t shared this with you, she\u2019s going to be staying with me for a while.\nMel: Oh, like some sort of test run?\nRick: I don\u2019t know. I mean, we'll see how it goes.\nMel: That\u2019s great. I\u2019m happy for you.\nRick: Am I dumping too much on you?\nMel: No.\nRick: If I am, I want you to be honest with me. I mean, can you handle this thing in E.R by yourself?\nMel: Oh, yeah. Absolutely. So I guess I\u2019ll just take a rain check on that sci-fi fest. You'll have your hands full for a while. But hey, it\u2019s not like you don\u2019t have a great excuse. There will be other festivals.\nRick: Uh-huh. Oh, yeah. I can see it all now. You're going to forget all about me now that I\u2019m a house daddy.\nMel: Are you kidding? I can\u2019t wait for Jude to grow up so we can drag his dad out to the cool films.\nRick: There you go. Well, I was on a diaper run, and that\u2019s what I need to do, so I\u2019m going to go get some diapers.\nMel: Okay, you'd better hurry.\nRick: Okay, bye.

This isn\u2019t funny.\nHarley: Maybe not to you.\nGus: You know, a couple of years ago there was a serial killer running around Washington, D.C., And the bureau gave me a big old plaque for taking him down, and I thought that I was pretty hot, I thought I was pretty amazing.\nHarley: You thought that, huh?\nGus: And I never thought I could top that. But when I realized that you and the baby were in danger, delivering that child into this world became the most important thing to me in my life. Everything else just seemed to evaporate.\nHarley: Well, I\u2019ll never forget what you did for him... I mean, me.\nGus: Helping you deliver Jude has been the proudest moment of my life so far.\nHarley: Thank you.\nGus: Why did you go back to Springfield?\nHarley: To be near my family and my friends, and to also have the baby with Rick. I mean, you know, he\u2019s the father, so I thought it was the least I could do for him.\nGus: Of course. Of course. But that\u2019s not why you came back.\nHarley: No?
