        "Gus: I just came to say hello to the fellas.\r\n",
        "Mallet: You're not working tonight. Don't\r\nyou have anything better else to do? ",
        "Gus: I can't say hello to the fellas? Come\r\non. Hey, we haven't hugged it out in a while. Give us a hug. ",
        "Mallet: Whoa, stop. Are you feeling okay?\r\nHow many fingers am I holding up? ",
        "Gus: Fine, I'm a little tired. Come on. ",
        "Mallet: Yeah, you look like crap, man. ",
        "Gus: We established that. Thank you very\r\nmuch. ",
        "Mallet: I've got just the thing for you.\r\nIt's the last doughnut. You need it more than I do. ",
        "Gus: (In Irish brogue) Ah, a little sugar.\r\nVery handy. Thanks very much. ",
        "Mallet: What's going on with you man? ",
        "Gus: Trying to put a bun in my girl's oven. ",
        "Mallet: Ah, that's good news. ",
        "Gus: Full-time job. ",

        "Gus: Oh, yeah. ",
        "Mallet: A-ha. A bun. ",
        "Gus: At the time, I don't know whether I'm\r\ncoming or going. I think I'm low on potassium. ",
        "Mallet: You know what? It's a good cause.\r\nIt's for a good cause, not to mention protein. ",
        "Gus: Shh. I don't want to talk about this in\r\nfront of the kid. ",
        "Marina: How's the baby making going? I know all about the\r\nbirds and the bees. Black, one sugar. ",
        "Mallet: Thank you. ",
        "Gus: Look at that, you've got her trained\r\nalready. You're good. ",
        "Mallet: Do you want some coffee? ",
        "Gus: Decaf. Forget it, you drink it. I'm\r\nout. ",
        "Marina: What is wrong with him? ",
        "Mallet: He's just... he's just Gus. ",
        "Marina: Yeah, but he was giving us kind of a funny look.\r\nYou don't think that he thinks that we're.... ",
        "Mallet: We're what? ",

        "Marina: You know, the whole Springfieldburns.com thing, you\r\nknow? Like we're an item. ",
        "Mallet: No, no, I don't think so. No, I\r\ndon't think anybody took that seriously. You know, now that you mention it, we\r\nare going to be spending a lot of time together. Could be intense situations,\r\ncould be in cramped quarters. I think we better talk. ",

        "Jeffrey: No, not since I last logged on. ",
        "Dinah: Well, that's good news. ",
        "Jeffrey: You know, there's no good news with\r\nthis blogger. Why can't the cops just shut this thing down? ",
        "Dinah: Well, then the blogger wouldn't have\r\nthe opportunity to go ahead and reveal your deep, dark secrets and cause you to\r\nlose your campaign. ",
        "Jeffrey: You know, I'm glad you find my\r\nanxiety so amusing. ",
        "Dinah: Do you know what's upsetting to me?\r\nThe anxiety that I get for when I think about the blogger coming in here while\r\nI'm sleeping. ",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, it's too bad you didn't\r\nget a good look at him. Whoever brings this blogger down is going to be a local\r\nhero, Dinah. We're talking major headlines, not to mention the bounty on his\r\nhead. I'm going to take a shower. ",
        "Dinah: All right. Hope you don't mind if I\r\nuse your password, Jeffrey. All for a good cause. It's time we had this out\r\nface to face. ",

        "Harley: Cassie? ",
        "Cassie: Hey, what are you doing here? ",
        "Harley: I was driving by and I was wondering\r\nif you would actually lend me a book. ",
        "Cassie: Sure, of course. Which book? ",
        "Harley: It's actually more than one book. So\r\nit would be plural books. Because I know that you have a few from when you and Edmund\r\nwere trying-- fertility books. ",
        "Cassie: Oh, my gosh, are you and Gus trying\r\nto have a baby? Oh, Harley, I am some happy for you. ",
        "Harley: The whole planning thing is so weird\r\nfor me because my last few were just, you know, surprise! ",
        "Cassie: How long have you guys been trying? ",
        "Harley: At least a couple of weeks. Don't\r\nlook at me like that because you know how I am. Once I decide I want a baby, I\r\nwant it yesterday. ",
        "Cassie: All right, then I better hurry and\r\nget those books. ",
        "Harley: Thank you. Is Josh around? Is he\r\ncoming around? Where is Josh? ",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I think he'll be back. He's\r\nwith Reva. I asked him to go talk to her. I know. I'm brilliant. I'm brilliant.\r\n",

        "Reva: Trouble? Me? I don't know what you're\r\ntalking about. ",
        "Josh: Okay. Cassie heard you tell Jonathan\r\nthat you have to leave. And then she said some guy came up and it appeared he\r\nwas threatening you. ",
        "Reva: Cassie saw all of this? ",
        "Josh: Mm-hmm. She was worried about you so\r\nshe went to talk to you about it. You were in the middle of something, and\r\nthere was a bank statement lying around on a desk, or something like that... \r\n",
        "Reva: She read my bank statement? ",
        "Josh: ...And it appears there's a whole lot\r\nof money that's being transferred in and out of your bank account, in fact,\r\nhundreds of thousands of dollars. ",
        "Reva: So she just walked into my room? ",
        "Josh: She's worried about you, Reva. ",
        "Reva: What else does she want from me? I\r\ngave you up. Isn't that enough for her? ",
        "Josh: What do you mean you gave me up? You\r\ndid everything you could to push me away, Reva. Now, is there something going\r\non with you that I don't know about, something that made you leave. Because\r\nthat would explain a lot of things. My God. I'm right, aren't I? There is\r\nsomething. Tell me. Tell me what's wrong right now. ",

        "Harley: Are you stalking me? ",

        "Harley: You're exhausted. ",
        "Gus: No, I'm fine. ",
        "Harley: I'm wearing you out. ",
        "Gus: I'm good. I'm a little tired, but then\r\nwhen I see you... b'oing 'oing, 'oing... ",
        "Harley: No, we'll have none of that. It's\r\nnot the time. We're trying to save it up, remember? We don't want to waste it. \r\n",
        "Gus: I don't want to think about time. Time\r\nthis, time that. You said your other pregnancies were like little surprises. \r\n",
        "Harley: Happy surprises. Say \"Happy\r\nsurprises.\" ",
        "Gus: Happy surprises. And I'm just saying--\r\nwant some fries with that shake-- I'm just saying, you know, maybe we should be\r\na little less by the book and just be a little bit more about our own secret\r\ntoy surprise. ",
        "Cassie: Well, you crazy kids don't need any\r\nbooks. You're going to make a baby right now on my couch. ",

        "Harley: He's leaving. You can come by and\r\nyou can pick me up later. ",
        "Cassie: You ought to think about taking a\r\nnap. You're a little tired looking. ",
        "Harley: Bye. You have to admit, he's cute. ",
        "Cassie: Adorable. Okay, get started with\r\nthese two. And if you still want more information, let me know, I'll pick out a\r\ncouple more. ",
        "Harley: Thank you. Thank you, thank you,\r\nthank you. Okay, enough about me. Let's talk about you. So what's the deal with\r\nJosh? You sent him back to Reva? ",
        "Cassie: Not back to Reva. I simply\r\nencouraged him to go talk to her, that's all. ",
        "Harley: Uh-huh. Because? ",
        "Cassie: Because she's been acting kind of\r\nweird lately. ",
        "Harley: And that's different from her usual\r\nbehavior, how? ",
        "Cassie: She's acting weirder, okay? She's\r\ngoing some things that, I don't know, don't make a whole lot of sense. ",
        "Harley: Really? ",
        "Cassie: Look, I don't need to bring my\r\ndetective friend into this, okay? ",
        "Harley: But you're willing to throw Josh\r\ninto it. ",
        "Cassie: Look, if something is wrong with\r\nher, I want to know about it, he wants to know about it. What? What is that\r\nlook for? ",
        "Harley: No reason. ",
        "Cassie: You are a terrible liar. ",
        "Harley: Cassie, why would you stir up\r\ntrouble where there is none? ",
        "Cassie: Well, who's to say there is none? ",
        "Harley: Do you honestly believe that he\r\nloves you and only you, that he wants to only be with you? ",
        "Cassie: Yes, absolutely. ",
        "Harley: Really? Okay, so what you're saying\r\nis you're not concerned at all that if Reva is in trouble that Josh will go to\r\nher to help her, that he'll get sucked back in to her orbit, and that they'll\r\nhook up again. That doesn't concern you at all? ",
        "Cassie: No, no. It does no worry me in the\r\nleast. Well, maybe I'm a little concerned. Okay, it's my worst nightmare. ",
        "",
        "Reva: So, does Cassie have any theories\r\nabout my mysterious problems? ",

        "Reva: Yes, we are. ",
        "Josh: And I realize things are awkward and\r\nstrange for all of us right now, but... look, if I knew Billy was in some kind\r\nof trouble I would lay down my life for him. You know that. Cassie would do the\r\nsame for you. You'd do the same thing for her. ",
        "Reva: Yeah. ",
        "Josh: So talk to me. Are you all right? ",
        "Reva: I'm fine. ",

        "Harley: She said yes. She said \"Happiest\r\nday\" of her life, \"Couldn't wait to marry Josh.\" Of course she\r\nrealized her mistake. ",
        "Cassie: Her mistake. ",
        "Harley: See, I... I don't think there's\r\nsomething Freudian going on here because I do that all the time with Gus. I\r\nalways call him Frank. And, ew, he's my brother. ",
        "Cassie: Different, altogether different. ",
        "Harley: So I asked her about it. Of course I\r\nasked her about it. For you. I was thinking of you. And she said yes, she would\r\nalways love Josh. Of course she would. But she realizes now that they can never\r\ntruly be happy together, and that you and he are happy together, and that she\r\nand Billy are happy together, and everybody should just move on with their\r\nlives. ",
        "Cassie: Okay, and you believed her? ",
        "Harley: I did believe her. You know why?\r\nBecause I saw her and Billy together. And maybe there's not this... that same\r\nthing, that passion, that huge passion. But there is a deep love there, there's\r\na connection between them. ",

        "Harley: And Gus has been there for me, even\r\nwhen I was mad at him, even when I didn't want him there. He stayed. And then I\r\nnearly lost him. Thanks God. Thank God I got him back. And here we are, we're\r\ngoing to have a baby together, hopefully. And I came to realize we have to live\r\nfor right now. We can't worry about what happened yesterday or what might\r\nhappen tomorrow. You have to find someone that you love and just love them. And\r\nif you love Josh, Cassie, let yourself be happy. ",
