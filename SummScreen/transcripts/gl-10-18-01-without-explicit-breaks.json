        "Josh: What was that?",
        "Reva: I hope this works. What just happened \r\nto me?",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\nRomeo: I\u2019m your hero, Marah, me-- not your boyfriend over there. But if you're \r\ntoo afraid to ask him, then fine, whatever, I understand.",
        "Marah: I\u2019m not afraid. It\u2019s just ridiculous, \r\nthat\u2019s all. Why should I believe you over Sam? He cares about me. He'd do \r\nanything for me. Why would you want to help my dad?",
        "Romeo: It was a business decision, that\u2019s \r\nall. And I don\u2019t like other guys taking credit for my work.",
        "Marah: You know what? I think it\u2019s the other \r\nway around. I think you're trying to take credit for something that Sam did.",
        "Romeo: \"Think\"? A moment ago you were sure.",
        "Marah: Sam is not a liar.",
        "Romeo: Neither am I.",
        "Marah: Why would he tell me he did something \r\nif he didn\u2019t do it?",
        "Romeo: Look, I\u2019m done arguing with you, okay? \r\nThe proof is over there. All you've got to do is ask.",
        "Marah: That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do.",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\u00a0",
        "Mel: Rick, wait, about the movie, I\u2019ll be \r\nbusy covering for you in the E.R, and you're going to be even busier with the \r\nbaby, so let\u2019s just forget about it.",
        "Rick: Okay, that\u2019s fine, until next week. \r\nThen we'll just reschedule.",
        "Mel: We're not rescheduling, Rick.",
        "Rick: Well, then, we'll just... We'll just do \r\nit the week after that, that\u2019s fine.",
        "Mel: No. We're not going to pick up where we \r\nleft off a couple of weeks ago. We had a good time. Let\u2019s just leave it at that.",
        "Rick: And why would we do that?",
        "Mel: Because I\u2019m stopping whatever this is \r\nbefore it starts. You have a baby, and he has a mother. I\u2019m the last thing you \r\nneed right now.",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nGus: You left town for the very same reason that you came back. You came back \r\nfor me.",
        "Harley: I didn\u2019t leave...",
        "Gus: Yeah, you did.",
        "Harley: No, I didn\u2019t. I left because my \r\nfather and Phillip and Rick were driving me crazy, and I just needed some time \r\non my own to sort things out.",
        "Gus: Oh, that... Did you sort things out? \r\nBecause you're back now.",
        "Harley: Yeah, I\u2019m back because I was \r\nhomesick. I was... I was in a strange place. I was surrounded by people I didn\u2019t \r\nknow. I wanted to come home. Is that so hard for you to understand?",
        "Gus: No, no, I understand. I was expecting \r\nyou. ",
        "Harley: Oh, you were expecting me?",
        "Gus: Yes, I was.",
        "Harley: Let me see if you can get this, okay? \r\nThis was a spontaneous decision, okay? I decided that I wanted to bring my child \r\ninto the world near his father and near the people that are most important to me \r\nin my life. You're not included in that group.",
        "Gus: That\u2019s fine that... Well, that you think \r\nthat, or that you convinced yourself of that. See, because I\u2019m not convinced of \r\nthat, because I see that. It\u2019s different... When I look in your eyes, it\u2019s...",
        "Harley: Are you nuts?",
        "Gus: No, look, don\u2019t be embarrassed, okay, if \r\nI have that effect on you. I understand.",
        "Harley: Look, Aitoro!",
        "Gus: Coop, what?",
        "Harley: I didn\u2019t leave because of you. Don\u2019t \r\nflatter yourself. And I certainly didn\u2019t come back because of you either.",
        "Gus: Make me believe that.",
        "Harley: I don\u2019t care what you believe! I \r\ndon\u2019t care what you believe. I mean, if you want to stand here and continue to \r\ndelude yourself about this, you go right ahead, but I suggest you do it on \r\nsomebody else\u2019s time, because I\u2019m exhausted. I just had a baby, remember? I\u2019m \r\nexhausted, and I\u2019m not in the mood for one of your little mind games, okay? So \r\nwe're going to walk to the door. Okay, we're walking. We're walking to the door. \r\nOkay, maybe I\u2019m not going to walk you to the door, but you are leaving, because \r\nI do need to get some rest.",
        "Gus: No, no, no.",
        "Harley: \"No\"? Okay, fine. Good night.",
        "Gus: Listen to me, listen.",
        "Harley: No, no.",
        "Gus: We almost kissed.",
        "Harley: No, no, no, no.",
        "Gus: We almost kissed before you ran out of \r\nhere like a little scared girl.",
        "Harley: Now, you're leaving. Now, you're \r\nleaving.",
        "Gus: No, not until you admit that we almost \r\nkissed, and you wanted that to happen. ",
        "Harley: How do you \"almost kiss\"? Okay, you \r\neither do or you don\u2019t. We didn\u2019t, and we wouldn\u2019t have, you got it?",
        "Gus: Cooper, think back.",
        "Harley: I don\u2019t need to think back!",
        "Gus: I came over to your house after the \r\ntrial, right? Now, maybe you were feeling vulnerable, or maybe you were feeling \r\nsympathetic, or maybe it was just a whole lot of different things at the same \r\ntime, and for a very long time, it was building up.",
        "Harley: Maybe you just have a little bit too \r\nmuch time on your hands, because I remember that night, too, Aitoro. Yes, you \r\nshowed up at my place because you had been exposed as a big fat liar on the \r\nstand by Ross. Ross had proven to everybody that you were just trying to get \r\nback at Danny to avenge your father\u2019s murder, and I gave you... Yeah, okay, I \r\ngave you a little sympathy. I gave you a little understanding.",
        "Gus: You would have given me a whole lot more \r\nthan that if I\u2019d stuck around. Listen, we both know that, okay? Something \r\nhappened that night, Cooper. Something happened, and you can\u2019t pretend that it \r\ndidn\u2019t. You just can\u2019t.He wanted justice.That\u2019s what he worked for allof his \r\nlife, justice.And that\u2019s all I really want,you know?Justice.And to this day, no \r\njustice. So just... Just admit it. Don\u2019t be shy. It\u2019s not the right time.",
        "Harley: You are an arrogant, self-absorbed \r\njerk. I mean, come on, you seriously think that there\u2019s something going on here \r\nbetween us? You're more delusional than I thought.",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\nReva: Was it a delusion? Or a hallucination? Or did I just doze off and I\u2019m \r\ndreaming the whole thing? (Knock on door) Hi.",
        "Felicia: I know it\u2019s late, but I've been \r\ntrying to reach you for hours.",
        "Reva: \"For hours\"?",
        "Felicia: I left three messages on your \r\nmachine. And when you didn\u2019t call me back, I got worried.",
        "Reva: I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d been gone so long.",
        "Felicia: We were supposed to go to dinner, \r\nremember? Are you all right?",
        "Reva: I just had the most incredible \r\nexperience of my life, and I need someone to tell me that I\u2019m not crazy.",
        "Felicia: Well, I can\u2019t make any guarantees, \r\nbut I\u2019ll give it a go.",
        "Reva: Sit, sit. You're a shrink, right, and \r\nyou see and you hear all kinds of things. But this... Is it possible to dream \r\nwhile you're awake?",
        "Felicia: Well, there are waking dreams where \r\nsomeone believes that they're awake and they really aren\u2019t. And these are really \r\nthe most terrifying, because they seem so real.",
        "Reva: Okay, so when you open your eyes... Are \r\nyou standing on your feet?",
        "Felicia: Not usually. You're in bed or on the \r\ncouch or wherever you fell asleep.",
        "Reva: That\u2019s what I was afraid you were going \r\nto say.",
        "Felicia: Reva, what is it?",
        "Reva: Do you believe in past lives? I mean, \r\ndo you really believe in past lives; that you lived another life as somebody \r\nelse?",
        "Felicia: Somebody like who?",
        "Reva: I don\u2019t know, anyone. But do you think \r\nit\u2019s possible? Do you believe in past lives?",
        "Felicia: Why do you ask?",
        "Reva: Because I think I just visited one of \r\nmine. And I\u2019ll tell you, something about the past is trying to tell me something \r\nabout the present.",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nNolan: Excuse me, sir. I know you asked not to be disturbed, but there\u2019s a \r\ngentleman here to see you.",
        "Josh: That\u2019s all right, Nolan. You don\u2019t have \r\nto announce me. Mr. Spaulding knows who I am. In fact, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised \r\nif he\u2019s expecting me.",
        "Nolan: I\u2019m sorry, sir.",
        "Alan: It\u2019s all right, Nolan. I guess someone \r\nhad to spoil my evening. To what do I owe this displeasure, Josh?",
        "Josh: You tell me, Alan. You left your \r\ncalling card behind when you came to see Olivia. I\u2019m guessing it wasn\u2019t a \r\nmistake, so the question is why? What do you want? ",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nMarah: I need to talk to you.",
        "Sam: I think you need to dance with me alone. \r\nOoh.",
        "Marah: Sam, I\u2019m serious.",
        "Sam: Ooh, she is serious.",
        "Marah: Sam.",
        "Sam: Oh, right, right.",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nRomeo: Yo, she is going to flip out. I guarantee it. I still don\u2019t understand \r\nwhy you don\u2019t want her to know that it was you.",
        "Tony: Look, I got one interest right now. I \r\nwant to get rid of Sam without spilling any blood. So if he leaves town, Carlos \r\nis going to be satisfied.",
        "Romeo: And what about your satisfaction?",
        "Tony: We got millions at stake in the harbor \r\nproject. If this doesn\u2019t go down the way we planned it...",
        "Romeo: Hey, it\u2019s taken care of, all right? \r\nSam Spencer will be out of here, one way or another.",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nSam: Talk to me.",
        "Marah: Somebody said something really \r\nterrible, and I want you to tell me it\u2019s not true. I want you to tell me that \r\nthey're lying. And if you say it, I\u2019ll believe you.",
        "Sam: Believe me about what?",
        "Marah: I swear, Sam, you say the word, and \r\nI\u2019ll forget all about it. I trust you more than anyone. You've always been \r\nstraight with me, haven\u2019t you?",
        "Sam: I have always tried to be, yes.",
        "Marah: And every time I was in trouble with \r\nthe lighthouse or with the boat, you were there. I've always been able to depend \r\non you.",
        "Sam: Hey, you still can.",
        "Marah: And you were there when nobody else \r\nwas, with my dad, which is why this makes so... This is just so difficult. But I \r\nneed to know.",
        "Sam: Something that I did?",
        "Marah: The photo, Sam, the one that helped my \r\ndad. They said you weren\u2019t responsible for it. But it\u2019s a lie, right? It\u2019s just \r\na lie?",
        "Sam: Marah, when that photo of your father \r\nhit the newsstands, I wanted nothing more than to help you and your family. I \r\nknew that that photo had been digitally altered.",
        "Marah: And you went out and proved it.",
        "Sam: Marah, let me finish",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\nRay: Okay, nice and loud.",
        "Crowd: How old are you now? How old are you \r\nnow? How old are you now...",
        "Tony: Okay, all right. Knock it off, knock it \r\noff. (Applause)",
        "Ray: You know, every year, every year, I ask \r\nhim this same question, and every year he says the same thing. It\u2019s sort of a \r\nfamily tradition for us. Make a wish. Blow out your candles. It, first things \r\nfirst. I want to thank Catalina for putting this great party together. (Cheers \r\nand applause) and before we go any further, I just want to say a couple of \r\nthings. My little brother hasn\u2019t had a lot of parties in his life. After I left, \r\nthings weren\u2019t always easy for him. That\u2019s why today is really an extra special \r\nday for us.",
        "Tony: Ray...",
        "Ray: Okay, okay. Blow out the candles. Don\u2019t \r\nforget to make a wish. (Crowd egging him on)",
        "Tony: All right, all right, all right. I hope \r\nthis comes true. (Cheers and applause)",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nMarah: It\u2019s a lie, right? You're the one that fixed things for my dad. If you're \r\nworried about who said you didn\u2019t...",
        "Sam: That\u2019s not what I\u2019m worried about.",
        "Marah: Then say it. Why won\u2019t you say it?",
        "Sam: I can\u2019t.",
        "Marah: What do you mean, you can\u2019t?",
        "Sam: Marah, I have wanted nothing more than \r\nto be honest with you. But when you assumed I was the one, the way you looked at \r\nme...",
        "Marah: You are the one...",
        "Sam: No. No.",
        "Marah: But you said...",
        "Sam: I know. I know what I said. I\u2019m sorry. I \r\nam so sorry, Marah. I care about you so much, maybe too much. And the last few \r\nweeks have been beyond great. I've been thinking that we could go somewhere \r\ntogether, that we could really be something together. But I can\u2019t go on like \r\nthis. I can\u2019t do this to you anymore. I am not the one who saved Josh. I\u2019m not \r\nyour hero. I\u2019m just Sam. And Sam screwed up.",
        "Marah: No. It can\u2019t be.",
        "Sam: I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Marah: You' been lying to me this whole time? \r\nHow could you?",
        "Sam: I wanted you.",
        "Marah: Why?",
        "Sam: I wanted you so much. Marah, I didn\u2019t \r\nhave a choice.",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\nRick: Sit down for a second, okay? Just for a second. I\u2019m a little confused, \r\nMel, because I thought we were really having a lot of fun together. Didn\u2019t you?",
        "Mel: We were. You're a great guy.",
        "Rick: Well, I\u2019ve gotten the \"great guy\" \r\nspeech before, but this is a world record. So what\u2019s next, \"it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s \r\nme\"? I mean...",
        "Mel: No, it is you. You're the reason why I\u2019m \r\nputting us into retirement. I want this to end before...",
        "Rick: Before what?",
        "Mel: Look, like you said, we had a good time. \r\nBut your life is about more than having fun right now. I mean, you have a \r\nnewborn, a baby that you've wanted for years. The mother of your son is moving \r\ninto your house. There\u2019s just not a whole lot of room for me in that equation.",
        "Rick: Mel... Mel, of course I\u2019m going to have \r\nmore responsibility and of course my life will be changing, but that doesn\u2019t \r\nmean I shouldn\u2019t have time for my friend should it? Now, come on, there\u2019s just \r\nno reason we should give up what we have right now.",
        "Mel: No, Rick, you need to go home to Harley \r\nand Jude. They need you, and you need them.",
        "Rick: Really? How is it that you know \r\neverything that I need?",
        "Mel: We're finished with this discussion, \r\nokay?",
        "Rick: Well, that\u2019s too...",
        "Mel: Go home to Harley and your son.",
        "Rick: Well, I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t take orders \r\nfrom a resident.",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\nHarley: Okay, let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s go out the door. You know what? Okay, maybe I\u2019m \r\ntoo weak to toss you out, but Meta\u2019s right upstairs. I don\u2019t think you want to \r\npress your luck with her.",
        "Gus: I\u2019m not buying.",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Gus: I\u2019m not buying this whole little act of \r\nyours. I\u2019m not buying it. I can see through you, okay? I can see beneath the \r\nbullet-proof facade that you go traipsing around in. I know you. I've seen you \r\nwith your kids. I saw you on the couch that night with me. So you can pretend \r\nall you want, but I know that you remember.",
        "Harley: Oh, God!",
        "Gus: Listen to me.",
        "Harley: You know what? Wait, wait. You... You \r\nneed to get a hobby. You've got too much time on your hands.",
        "Gus: I know that you remember it, Harley, \r\nokay? I know that you're picturing it in your mind right now. You sat down on \r\nthe couch next to me, and you were touched by my story. You were touched by me. \r\nYou leaned in close, and it would have been so easy to have just given in. How \r\nmany times have you replayed this over and over in your mind the last several \r\nmonths? How many times have you wondered what it would be like if you just had \r\nleaned in and closed your eyes? ",
        "Gus: That kind of hurt, Coop.",
        "Harley: How dare you? How dare you? How dare \r\nyou come here and try to force yourself on me? How dare you do that? Who do you \r\nthink you are? You know, I just had a baby, okay? I just had a baby, and I\u2019m \r\nexhausted, and you come here and you try to take advantage of that? I mean, what \r\nis that? You know, I don\u2019t want you, Aitoro. I never have. I don\u2019t... I don\u2019t \r\nsit there and think about you the way that you think I do. And I certainly don\u2019t \r\ndream about you!",
        "Gus: Calm down.",
        "Harley: Okay, no, I don\u2019t want to calm down! \r\nI don\u2019t want to calm down, okay? Because I wanted you to go, and you wouldn\u2019t \r\nleave! Look, I\u2019m... I\u2019m obviously... You know what I've been through. I\u2019m \r\nconfused. I\u2019m confused, and I\u2019m weak, and I can barely stand here. And I don\u2019t \r\nwant that, I don\u2019t want that. I don\u2019t want you to do that. I don\u2019t want you to \r\ndo anything. I just want you to leave. I just want you to leave.",
        "Gus: You're upset.",
        "Harley: You know what? Listen, you brought my \r\nbaby into the world, and I\u2019m grateful for that, okay? I\u2019ll always be grateful \r\nfor that. But that is where it ends between us! You had no right to do what you \r\njust did.",
        "Gus: You're upset because you responded.",
        "Harley: No, I wasn\u2019t responding. That wasn\u2019t \r\nresponding. I fell forward from exhaustion. That\u2019s what that was. And now I need \r\nto get some rest, and I need you... I need you to leave this house. I want you \r\nto go. Get out!",
        "Gus: You know where to find me. And you will \r\nwant to find me. You will.",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nRick: So how is it that you care more about my schedule than I do?",
        "Mel: Why can\u2019t we just let it go?",
        "Rick: I don\u2019t have a life with Harley, Mel, \r\nokay? There was a time that I offered it to make it more than it was, but she \r\ndidn\u2018t want to have any part of it. So we are together for one purpose and one \r\npurpose only: To raise little boy. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all it is, okay?",
        "Mel: That\u2019s a lot.",
        "Rick: I know. I\u2019m going to have my hands full \r\nwith that little boy. There\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t take a night here or there \r\nto go out and grab a burger and see a movie, is there? There\u2019s no reason why we \r\nhave to give up what we have.",
        "Mel: There are two very important reasons. \r\nBut you're very sweet. If things were different... Well, let\u2019s just say timing \r\nis everything.",
        "Rick: You haven\u2019t heard a single word that I \r\nhave said to you.",
        "Mel: Good-bye, Rick. Don\u2019t worry; I\u2019ve got \r\nyou covered at E.R.",
        "Rick: Mel, wait a second. Mel...",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nFelicia: So you stepped through the painting? That painting?",
        "Reva: Yeah. Only when I got to the other \r\nside, the painting wasn\u2019t finished yet, and I was in New Orleans during the \r\ncivil war. And Regina recognized me as a nurse who was there to take care of her \r\nhusband. And she had a son, but it was a stepson, Beauregard Robichaux. And he \r\nlooked exactly like my son.",
        "Felicia: Wow.",
        "Reva: All he talked about was wanting to go \r\nto war. He wanted to be a big hero like his daddy. His daddy was colonel Jack \r\nRobechaux, and after meeting the man, I can understand it all, because he looked \r\nlike Joshua. I mean, he had an accent, and he had his arm in a sling, and he was \r\na different man, but yet he was still Josh. And he recognized me, too.",
        "Felicia: Did he call you by name?",
        "Reva: Well, no, not exactly, but it was more \r\nlike... Like a connection, like when we were younger. But he kept staring at me, \r\nand I tried to focus on his arm and dressing his wound, but he wouldn\u2019t stop \r\nstaring at me. And all of a sudden, out of the blue, he looks me straight in the \r\neye and he says, \"You are familiar somehow. Have we met?\"",
        "Felicia: Well, now, you're giving me \r\nGoosebumps.",
        "Reva: Yeah, but it was all so real-- I mean, \r\nthe smell of gardenias, and the sounds and the touch of people. It wasn\u2019t a \r\ndream, because it was real. I know it was.",
        "Felicia: Look, Reva, Reva, there are some \r\nthings in this world that cannot be explained.",
        "Reva: Yeah, but you've never heard anything \r\nlike this before.",
        "Felicia: Have you tried to walkthrough again?",
        "Reva: I don\u2019t go back, not until I can \r\nunderstand this better.",
        "Felicia: But do you think you can go back?",
        "Reva: Well, before, all I did was touch the \r\npainting and my hand went through the canvas.",
        "Felicia: Go ahead. I\u2019m right here.",
        "Reva: I know what this looks like to you.",
        "Felicia: Don\u2019t worry about that. If you \r\nbelieve it, then it\u2019s real to you.",
        "Reva: Yeah, along with all the other loons \r\nthat you have locked up in some nuthouse, right?",
        "Felicia: There are many, many ways of \r\nrevisiting the past. The important question is, why? I mean, why is it so \r\nnecessary for you to go through such an extraordinary journey?",
        "Reva: I don\u2019t know, but everyone I met was so \r\nfamiliar. Maybe they're trying to teach me something about myself or... Or \r\nsomething about the present that can\u2019t be changed any other way.",
        "Felicia: Well, can you think of something \r\nthat you might need to change?",
        "Reva: No, but I met another man, General \r\nHudson, and he was having an affair with the woman in the portrait.",
        "Felicia: A woman who looks like Olivia?",
        "Reva: Yeah, only... It gets better, because \r\ngeneral Hudson looked exactly like Alan Spaulding. And I said I was just going \r\nto stay out of that whole situation, but something keeps pulling me back there.",
        "Felicia: Reva, what situation?",
        "Reva: Alan and Olivia are working on the San \r\nCristobel harbor project together; only I think there\u2019s more to it than just \r\nbusiness. So maybe I\u2019m supposed to expose them in the past to prevent something \r\nfrom happening in the present.",
        "Felicia: Reva, find out what your journey \r\nmeans to you first.",
        "Reva: Well, if I could find the answer to \r\nthat question, I could get rid of the painting and never have to look at it \r\nagain. But until that day comes...",
        "Felicia: You'll do what?",
        "Reva: I have to find the truth, Felicia.",

        "Josh: What the hell are you insinuating?",
        "Alan: Look, why don\u2019t we just leave this for \r\nthe time being? Because I was in a mood to celebrate Beth\u2019s return.",
        "Josh: Beth?",
        "Alan: Yes, she is alive. It\u2019s a miracle. \r\nBeth\u2019s return has proven to me that anything is possible, Josh. Now, if you'll \r\nexcuse me.",
        "Josh: We are not finished!",
        "Alan: No, no, we're not finished. But now \r\nthat everything\u2019s in the open, I don\u2019t have to lurk in the shadows anymore.",
        "Josh: Oh, is that what you've been doing, \r\nAlan, lurking in the shadows?",
        "Alan: I won\u2019t deny my interest in Olivia, \r\nbecause I see things in her that you could never appreciate. I can offer her \r\nthings that would make you pale by comparison. Let\u2019s leave it at this: My power \r\nand influence versus your love. May the best man win.",
