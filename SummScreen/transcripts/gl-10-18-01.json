But if you're too afraid to ask him, then fine, whatever, I understand.\nMarah: I\u2019m not afraid. It\u2019s just ridiculous, that\u2019s all. Why should I believe you over Sam? He cares about me. He'd do anything for me. Why would you want to help my dad?\nRomeo: It was a business decision, that\u2019s all. And I don\u2019t like other guys taking credit for my work.\nMarah: You know what? I think it\u2019s the other way around. I think you're trying to take credit for something that Sam did.\nRomeo: \"Think\"? A moment ago you were sure.\nMarah: Sam is not a liar.\nRomeo: Neither am I.\nMarah: Why would he tell me he did something if he didn\u2019t do it?\nRomeo: Look, I\u2019m done arguing with you, okay? The proof is over there. All you've got to do is ask.\nMarah: That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "__________________________________________\n\u00a0\nMel: Rick, wait, about the movie, I\u2019ll be busy covering for you in the E.R, and you're going to be even busier with the baby, so let\u2019s just forget about it.\nRick: Okay, that\u2019s fine, until next week. Then we'll just reschedule.\nMel: We're not rescheduling, Rick.\nRick: Well, then, we'll just... We'll just do it the week after that, that\u2019s fine.\nMel: No. We're not going to pick up where we left off a couple of weeks ago. We had a good time. Let\u2019s just leave it at that.\nRick: And why would we do that?\nMel: Because I\u2019m stopping whatever this is before it starts. You have a baby, and he has a mother. I\u2019m the last thing you need right now.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "__________________________________________\nGus: You left town for the very same reason that you came back. You came back for me.\nHarley: I didn\u2019t leave...\nGus: Yeah, you did.\nHarley: No, I didn\u2019t. I left because my father and Phillip and Rick were driving me crazy, and I just needed some time on my own to sort things out.\nGus: Oh, that... Did you sort things out? Because you're back now.\nHarley: Yeah, I\u2019m back because I was homesick. I was... I was in a strange place. I was surrounded by people I didn\u2019t know. I wanted to come home. Is that so hard for you to understand?\nGus: No, no, I understand. I was expecting you. \nHarley: Oh, you were expecting me?\nGus: Yes, I was.\nHarley: Let me see if you can get this, okay? This was a spontaneous decision, okay? I decided that I wanted to bring my child into the world near his father and near the people that are most important to me in my life. You're not included in that group.\nGus: That\u2019s fine that... Well, that you think that, or that you convinced yourself of that. See, because I\u2019m not convinced of that, because I see that. It\u2019s different... When I look in your eyes, it\u2019s...\nHarley: Are you nuts?\nGus: No, look, don\u2019t be embarrassed, okay, if I have that effect on you. I understand.\nHarley: Look, Aitoro!\nGus: Coop, what?\nHarley: I didn\u2019t leave because of you. Don\u2019t flatter yourself. And I certainly didn\u2019t come back because of you either.\nGus: Make me believe that.\nHarley: I don\u2019t care what you believe! I don\u2019t care what you believe. I mean, if you want to stand here and continue to delude yourself about this, you go right ahead, but I suggest you do it on somebody else\u2019s time, because I\u2019m exhausted. I just had a baby, remember? I\u2019m exhausted, and I\u2019m not in the mood for one of your little mind games, okay? So we're going to walk to the door. Okay, we're walking. We're walking to the door. Okay, maybe I\u2019m not going to walk you to the door, but you are leaving, because I do need to get some rest.\nGus: No, no, no.\nHarley: \"No\"? Okay, fine. Good night.\nGus: Listen to me, listen.\nHarley: No, no.\nGus: We almost kissed.\nHarley: No, no, no, no.\nGus: We almost kissed before you ran out of here like a little scared girl.\nHarley: Now, you're leaving. Now, you're leaving.\nGus: No, not until you admit that we almost kissed, and you wanted that to happen. \nHarley: How do you \"almost kiss\"? Okay, you either do or you don\u2019t. We didn\u2019t, and we wouldn\u2019t have, you got it?\nGus: Cooper, think back.\nHarley: I don\u2019t need to think back!\nGus: I came over to your house after the trial, right? Now, maybe you were feeling vulnerable, or maybe you were feeling sympathetic, or maybe it was just a whole lot of different things at the same time, and for a very long time, it was building up.\nHarley: Maybe you just have a little bit too much time on your hands, because I remember that night, too, Aitoro. Yes, you showed up at my place because you had been exposed as a big fat liar on the stand by Ross. Ross had proven to everybody that you were just trying to get back at Danny to avenge your father\u2019s murder, and I gave you... Yeah, okay, I gave you a little sympathy. I gave you a little understanding.\nGus: You would have given me a whole lot more than that if I\u2019d stuck around. Listen, we both know that, okay? Something happened that night, Cooper. Something happened, and you can\u2019t pretend that it didn\u2019t. You just can\u2019t.He wanted justice.That\u2019s what he worked for allof his life, justice.And that\u2019s all I really want,you know?Justice.And to this day, no justice. So just... Just admit it. Don\u2019t be shy. It\u2019s not the right time.\nHarley: You are an arrogant, self-absorbed jerk. I mean, come on, you seriously think that there\u2019s something going on here between us? You're more delusional than I thought.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "___________________________________________\nReva: Was it a delusion? Or a hallucination? Or did I just doze off and I\u2019m dreaming the whole thing? (Knock on door) Hi.\nFelicia: I know it\u2019s late, but I've been trying to reach you for hours.\nReva: \"For hours\"?\nFelicia: I left three messages on your machine. And when you didn\u2019t call me back, I got worried.\nReva: I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d been gone so long.\nFelicia: We were supposed to go to dinner, remember? Are you all right?\nReva: I just had the most incredible experience of my life, and I need someone to tell me that I\u2019m not crazy.\nFelicia: Well, I can\u2019t make any guarantees, but I\u2019ll give it a go.\nReva: Sit, sit. You're a shrink, right, and you see and you hear all kinds of things. But this... Is it possible to dream while you're awake?\nFelicia: Well, there are waking dreams where someone believes that they're awake and they really aren\u2019t. And these are really the most terrifying, because they seem so real.\nReva: Okay, so when you open your eyes... Are you standing on your feet?\nFelicia: Not usually. You're in bed or on the couch or wherever you fell asleep.\nReva: That\u2019s what I was afraid you were going to say.\nFelicia: Reva, what is it?\nReva: Do you believe in past lives? I mean, do you really believe in past lives; that you lived another life as somebody else?\nFelicia: Somebody like who?\nReva: I don\u2019t know, anyone. But do you think it\u2019s possible? Do you believe in past lives?\nFelicia: Why do you ask?\nReva: Because I think I just visited one of mine.

I know you asked not to be disturbed, but there\u2019s a gentleman here to see you.\nJosh: That\u2019s all right, Nolan. You don\u2019t have to announce me. Mr. Spaulding knows who I am. In fact, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he\u2019s expecting me.\nNolan: I\u2019m sorry, sir.\nAlan: It\u2019s all right, Nolan. I guess someone had to spoil my evening. To what do I owe this displeasure, Josh?\nJosh: You tell me, Alan. You left your calling card behind when you came to see Olivia. I\u2019m guessing it wasn\u2019t a mistake, so the question is why?

So if he leaves town, Carlos is going to be satisfied.\nRomeo: And what about your satisfaction?\nTony: We got millions at stake in the harbor project.

I trust you more than anyone. You've always been straight with me, haven\u2019t you?\nSam: I have always tried to be, yes.\nMarah: And every time I was in trouble with the lighthouse or with the boat, you were there. I've always been able to depend on you.\nSam: Hey, you still can.\nMarah: And you were there when nobody else was, with my dad, which is why this makes so... This is just so difficult. But I need to know.\nSam: Something that I did?\nMarah: The photo, Sam, the one that helped my dad. They said you weren\u2019t responsible for it. But it\u2019s a lie, right? It\u2019s just a lie?\nSam: Marah, when that photo of your father hit the newsstands, I wanted nothing more than to help you and your family.

(Cheers and applause) and before we go any further, I just want to say a couple of things. My little brother hasn\u2019t had a lot of parties in his life.

I am so sorry, Marah. I care about you so much, maybe too much. And the last few weeks have been beyond great. I've been thinking that we could go somewhere together, that we could really be something together. But I can\u2019t go on like this. I can\u2019t do this to you anymore.

I\u2019m a little confused, Mel, because I thought we were really having a lot of fun together. Didn\u2019t you?\nMel: We were. You're a great guy.\nRick: Well, I\u2019ve gotten the \"great guy\" speech before, but this is a world record. So what\u2019s next, \"it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me\"? I mean...\nMel: No, it is you. You're the reason why I\u2019m putting us into retirement. I want this to end before...\nRick: Before what?\nMel: Look, like you said, we had a good time. But your life is about more than having fun right now. I mean, you have a newborn, a baby that you've wanted for years. The mother of your son is moving into your house. There\u2019s just not a whole lot of room for me in that equation.\nRick: Mel... Mel, of course I\u2019m going to have more responsibility and of course my life will be changing, but that doesn\u2019t mean I shouldn\u2019t have time for my friend should it? Now, come on, there\u2019s just no reason we should give up what we have right now.\nMel: No, Rick, you need to go home to Harley and Jude. They need you, and you need them.\nRick: Really? How is it that you know everything that I need?\nMel: We're finished with this discussion, okay?\nRick: Well, that\u2019s too...\nMel: Go home to Harley and your son.\nRick: Well, I\u2019m sorry.

Okay, maybe I\u2019m too weak to toss you out, but Meta\u2019s right upstairs. I don\u2019t think you want to press your luck with her.\nGus: I\u2019m not buying.\nHarley: What?\nGus: I\u2019m not buying this whole little act of yours. I\u2019m not buying it. I can see through you, okay? I can see beneath the bullet-proof facade that you go traipsing around in. I know you. I've seen you with your kids. I saw you on the couch that night with me. So you can pretend all you want, but I know that you remember.\nHarley: Oh, God!\nGus: Listen to me.\nHarley: You know what? Wait, wait. You... You need to get a hobby. You've got too much time on your hands.\nGus: I know that you remember it, Harley, okay? I know that you're picturing it in your mind right now. You sat down on the couch next to me, and you were touched by my story. You were touched by me. You leaned in close, and it would have been so easy to have just given in. How many times have you replayed this over and over in your mind the last several months? How many times have you wondered what it would be like if you just had leaned in and closed your eyes? \nGus: That kind of hurt, Coop.\nHarley: How dare you? How dare you? How dare you come here and try to force yourself on me? How dare you do that? Who do you think you are? You know, I just had a baby, okay? I just had a baby, and I\u2019m exhausted, and you come here and you try to take advantage of that? I mean, what is that? You know, I don\u2019t want you, Aitoro. I never have. I don\u2019t... I don\u2019t sit there and think about you the way that you think I do. And I certainly don\u2019t dream about you!\nGus: Calm down.\nHarley: Okay, no, I don\u2019t want to calm down! I don\u2019t want to calm down, okay? Because I wanted you to go, and you wouldn\u2019t leave! Look, I\u2019m... I\u2019m obviously... You know what I've been through. I\u2019m confused. I\u2019m confused, and I\u2019m weak, and I can barely stand here. And I don\u2019t want that, I don\u2019t want that. I don\u2019t want you to do that. I don\u2019t want you to do anything. I just want you to leave. I just want you to leave.\nGus: You're upset.\nHarley: You know what? Listen, you brought my baby into the world, and I\u2019m grateful for that, okay? I\u2019ll always be grateful for that. But that is where it ends between us! You had no right to do what you just did.\nGus: You're upset because you responded.\nHarley: No, I wasn\u2019t responding. That wasn\u2019t responding. I fell forward from exhaustion. That\u2019s what that was. And now I need to get some rest, and I need you... I need you to leave this house. I want you to go. Get out!\nGus: You know where to find me. And you will want to find me. You will.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "_________________________________________\nRick: So how is it that you care more about my schedule than I do?\nMel: Why can\u2019t we just let it go?\nRick: I don\u2019t have a life with Harley, Mel, okay? There was a time that I offered it to make it more than it was, but she didn\u2018t want to have any part of it. So we are together for one purpose and one purpose only: To raise little boy. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all it is, okay?\nMel: That\u2019s a lot.\nRick: I know. I\u2019m going to have my hands full with that little boy. There\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t take a night here or there to go out and grab a burger and see a movie, is there? There\u2019s no reason why we have to give up what we have.\nMel: There are two very important reasons. But you're very sweet. If things were different... Well, let\u2019s just say timing is everything.\nRick: You haven\u2019t heard a single word that I have said to you.\nMel: Good-bye, Rick. Don\u2019t worry; I\u2019ve got you covered at E.R.\nRick: Mel, wait a second. Mel...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "_________________________________________\nFelicia: So you stepped through the painting? That painting?\nReva: Yeah. Only when I got to the other side, the painting wasn\u2019t finished yet, and I was in New Orleans during the civil war. And Regina recognized me as a nurse who was there to take care of her husband. And she had a son, but it was a stepson, Beauregard Robichaux. And he looked exactly like my son.\nFelicia: Wow.\nReva: All he talked about was wanting to go to war. He wanted to be a big hero like his daddy. His daddy was colonel Jack Robechaux, and after meeting the man, I can understand it all, because he looked like Joshua. I mean, he had an accent, and he had his arm in a sling, and he was a different man, but yet he was still Josh. And he recognized me, too.\nFelicia: Did he call you by name?\nReva: Well, no, not exactly, but it was more like... Like a connection, like when we were younger. But he kept staring at me, and I tried to focus on his arm and dressing his wound, but he wouldn\u2019t stop staring at me. And all of a sudden, out of the blue, he looks me straight in the eye and he says, \"You are familiar somehow. Have we met?\"\nFelicia: Well, now, you're giving me Goosebumps.\nReva: Yeah, but it was all so real-- I mean, the smell of gardenias, and the sounds and the touch of people. It wasn\u2019t a dream, because it was real. I know it was.\nFelicia: Look, Reva, Reva, there are some things in this world that cannot be explained.\nReva: Yeah, but you've never heard anything like this before.\nFelicia: Have you tried to walkthrough again?\nReva: I don\u2019t go back, not until I can understand this better.\nFelicia: But do you think you can go back?\nReva: Well, before, all I did was touch the painting and my hand went through the canvas.\nFelicia: Go ahead. I\u2019m right here.\nReva: I know what this looks like to you.\nFelicia: Don\u2019t worry about that. If you believe it, then it\u2019s real to you.\nReva: Yeah, along with all the other loons that you have locked up in some nuthouse, right?\nFelicia: There are many, many ways of revisiting the past. The important question is, why? I mean, why is it so necessary for you to go through such an extraordinary journey?\nReva: I don\u2019t know, but everyone I met was so familiar. Maybe they're trying to teach me something about myself or... Or something about the present that can\u2019t be changed any other way.\nFelicia: Well, can you think of something that you might need to change?\nReva: No, but I met another man, General Hudson, and he was having an affair with the woman in the portrait.\nFelicia: A woman who looks like Olivia?\nReva: Yeah, only... It gets better, because general Hudson looked exactly like Alan Spaulding. And I said I was just going to stay out of that whole situation, but something keeps pulling me back there.\nFelicia: Reva, what situation?\nReva: Alan and Olivia are working on the San Cristobel harbor project together; only I think there\u2019s more to it than just business. So maybe I\u2019m supposed to expose them in the past to prevent something from happening in the present.\nFelicia: Reva, find out what your journey means to you first.\nReva: Well, if I could find the answer to that question, I could get rid of the painting and never have to look at it again. But until that day comes...\nFelicia: You'll do what?\nReva: I have to find the truth, Felicia.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "__________________________________________\nAlan: Josh, thank you for returning this. I was wondering where I left it.\nJosh: Were you?\nAlan: Yes, I mean... But you didn\u2019t have to go to the trouble to deliver it to me.\nJosh: Didn\u2019t I?\nAlan: What\u2019s going on? You seem to have something on your mind.\nJosh: No, you do. I think you've had my wife on your mind for some time now.\nAlan: Well, Olivia\u2019s a very captivating woman. It\u2019s hard not to think about her, Josh.\nJosh: She told me that you've been trying to lure her to Spaulding.\nAlan: Well, nothing would make me happier than to have Olivia by my side in a Spaulding board meeting. But she is very devoted to Lewis and to you.\nJosh: Yes, she is. But that\u2019s not stopped you before, has it? So I am here to say to you, stay away from Olivia. Leave her alone.\nAlan: Are we talking business here? Because you're starting to sound a little personal.\nJosh: You really do believe that money can buy anything, don\u2019t you, Alan?\nAlan: In my experience, yes. I believe that everyone has their price. I believe that to be true.\nJosh: Not for Olivia.\nAlan: How well do you know her, Josh?\nJosh: She\u2019s my wife.\nAlan: That\u2019s not what I asked.\nJosh: I know her better than you will ever know her!\nAlan: You know what you want to know, just like Annie. But it takes a man like me to appreciate her special qualities, and I do.\nJosh: What the hell are you insinuating?\nAlan: Look, why don\u2019t we just leave this for the time being? Because I was in a mood to celebrate Beth\u2019s return.\nJosh: Beth?\nAlan: Yes, she is alive. It\u2019s a miracle. Beth\u2019s return has proven to me that anything is possible, Josh. Now, if you'll excuse me.\nJosh: We are not finished!\nAlan: No, no, we're not finished. But now that everything\u2019s in the open, I don\u2019t have to lurk in the shadows anymore.\nJosh: Oh, is that what you've been doing, Alan, lurking in the shadows?\nAlan: I won\u2019t deny my interest in Olivia, because I see things in her that you could never appreciate. I can offer her things that would make you pale by comparison. Let\u2019s leave it at this: My power and influence versus your love. May the best man win.\nJosh: The best man has already won.\nAlan: See yourself out. We're done here.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "___________________________________________\nReva: Good night, Felicia, and thanks. (Horn honks) You cheated on your husband. I saw it with my own eyes. But is Olivia cheating on Joshua? Is she sleeping with Alan? (Laughs) It can\u2019t be something that simple, that small.

You deserve to know what happened, even if telling you is the hardest thing I've ever had to do.\nMarah: That makes a lot of sense.\nSam: It makes perfect sense, Marah. The person who is responsible for this didn\u2019t want you to know. If that person did, they would have come forward a long time ago. That person didn\u2019t come forward, so...\nMarah: Who?

What about you?\nReva: Well, I guess you could say I\u2019m here for business, too.\nJosh: But you're not sure?\nReva: Well, let\u2019s just say that some things have happened in the last day or so that need some sort of confirmation.\nJosh: I see. Let me guess: The harbor project, right?\nReva: No, not exactly. It\u2019s something a little more involved than that.
