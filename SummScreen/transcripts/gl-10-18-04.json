        "Cassie: Get away from him!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: Where are Blake and Michelle?",
        "Sebastian: They're coming. Are you nervous? You're not afraid of flying, are you?",
        "Holly: Right now I'm more concerned about where we're going than how we're getting there.",
        "Sebastian: You already know where we're going, Holly. Think about it. What island is accessible from Miami by yacht?",
        "Holly: Santa Domingo. Where Roger kidnapped me.",
        "Sebastian: He wanted the story to come full circle, Holly, and end there.",
        "Holly: I am such a fool to go along with this.",
        "Sebastian: No, no, it makes complete and perfect sense. You are doing this for your own peace of mind, for Roger, and admit it--you're also doing it partly for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tony: Oh, Michelle. Michelle. Michelle.",
        "Michelle: Shut up. Just shut up. (Knock at the door)",
        "Limo driver: Ms. Santos? Ms. Santos? Oh. Oh. Sorry. I'm here to drive you to the airport.",
        "Michelle: Oh.",
        "Limo driver: I'll wait down stairs.",
        "Michelle: Oh. Oh, what am I thinking? What am I thinking?",
        "Tony: (Laughs) I don't know. That it's about time?",
        "Michelle: I got to go, Tony.",
        "Tony: Michelle, Michelle, please, you don't have to... you don't have to go and do anything. Just stay here.",
        "Michelle: I want to go. Okay, this... this would have been... look I just ended things with Danny, all right? And it will be really easy for me to jump into things with you, but I can't. I can't do that, okay. It would be a mistake.",
        "Tony: I... I don't think so.",
        "Michelle: I can't... I can't do this, Tony.",
        "Tony: Okay. All right. Michelle, what is it you hope to accomplish with this trip? I don't get it.",
        "Michelle: I don't know. To get away. To have an adventure. Maybe get some of my memories back.",
        "Tony: Oh, yes, so much for acting on impulse and instincts, huh?",
        "Michelle: Tony, it's my instincts that's telling me that I need to do this. I've got to find out if there's something more.",
        "Tony: (Laughs) oh, yeah. More, right? You mean you and Danny, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Wait. Just wait. I just always imagined candlelight.",
        "JB: Better light up enough of those so I can still see you.",
        "Tammy: You always say the perfect thing.",
        "JB: You inspire me. What are you doing standing all the way over there? Come here. You look even more amazing in this light. Does it make you nervous, being at your uncle's place?",
        "Tammy: No, I'm not nervous.",
        "JB: (Clears his throat) hey, you're doing good, Tammy. Better than good. I want you now--with the candles lit and you exactly like you are. Let's go to the bedroom.",
        "Tammy: Well, what's the rush? We have all night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse: No, you need to rest. Not talk.",
        "Sandy: Reva. Tell her... tell her...",
        "Nurse: Let the sedative do it's job.",
        "Sandy: Tammy.",
        "Nurse: I'm sure your mother will be back in the morning. In the meantime, try to get some sleep.",
        "Sandy: Reva.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: You're home.",
        "Josh: Yeah, it's me, darling. You need to sit down right now, Reva.",
        "Reva: No, no, no, we have to go to the hospital, because Tammy called and Sandy's awake.",
        "Josh: Reva, Reva, you could see him tomorrow in the morning, okay.",
        "Reva: No. No, now. Now. We have to go now.",
        "Josh: No, you're not in shape to go anywhere right now.",
        "Reva: Everything's so crazy. I don't know what to do. And I don't know what to think.",
        "Josh: It's okay. It's all right. It's okay. I'll take care of it. I'll handle it. (Phone rings)",
        "Reva: I don't think you can. I don't think you can fix this.",
        "Josh: Just let it... let the machine pick it up.",
        "Reva: No, no, no. Might be the hospital.",
        "Josh: Re... Reva.",
        "Reva: Hello? Hello?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "JB: It's not that I'm rushing. I just... I don't know. I waited a long time for this. Trust me, tonight's the night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tony: Michelle, what is this, you know, your memory thing? You making it about you and Danny again? I mean, what?",
        "Michelle: Look, Tony, when you and I are together, I know that we have a spark, okay? But I can't be with you any more than I can be with Danny right now.",
        "Tony: Michelle, Danny and I are not the same.",
        "Michelle: I know that.",
        "Tony: We're not.",
        "Michelle: I know that. But there's something missing from me. And I'm not going to find it by staying around with you or letting Danny fix me. When I woke from the coma, Tony, my whole life has been about just finding myself and figuring out who I am. But somewhere along the line, you know, it became about me and Danny and then me and you. And now you and Danny turning against each other.",
        "Tony: No, no, no. Michelle, you didn't do that, okay.",
        "Michelle: Tony, look, I'm walking away from this, okay, and I'm going to look for something else. And I don't know if I'm going to find it. But I know that I have to go.",
        "Tony: What are you looking for? You know what? Fine. I can't stop you, and I won't.",
        "Michelle: No?",
        "Tony: No, I won't. Because you know what? You seem like you're pretty clear on what you want. So I'll tell you what. You go for it.",
        "Michelle: Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: I know what you're thinking. You think there's something in your eyes, something in your voice that reminds me of him. If that was true, I would run in the opposite direction.",
        "Sebastian: Why do you always do that?",
        "Holly: Do what?",
        "Sebastian: Cut Roger down every chance you get. You know, it's almost like you only allow yourself to focus on his negative aspects.",
        "Holly: (Laughs) as opposed to what?",
        "Sebastian: His positive. You know what I think. I think you're afraid to acknowledge the good parts of him, because then you would have to really deal with how much it hurts to lose him.",
        "Holly: I have spent plenty of time recalling every facet of that man. So you spare me your thumbnail psychoanalysis.",
        "Sebastian: No, no, I can see it. I can see it so clearly. There is a desire in you.",
        "Holly: And what is that desire, doctor?",
        "Sebastian: The desire to speak to my father one last time, to make one final statement, to put closure on this relationship. This long personal involved relationship. So go ahead. Use me.",
        "Holly: Use you?",
        "Sebastian: Yeah, use me. I'm Roger. Say whatever it is you need to say to him. Come on. It could do us good. Both of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: What the hell do you think you're doing?",
        "Dinah: You don't know? I feel sorry for Edmund.",
        "Cassie: Shut up, Dinah.",
        "Jeffrey: Ladies, please.",
        "Cassie: I can't believe this. I can't believe you.",
        "Jeffrey: Mrs. Winslow, actually you just barged into something completely consensual. I don't understand what the problem is.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I don't see how we're causing any trouble.",
        "Cassie: The trouble is you're doing the same old thing. You're trying to worm your way back into my life, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: I'm sorry. How does this kiss have anything to do with your life?",
        "Cassie: Because you know Jeffrey and I are friends. So you...",
        "Jeffrey: Actually I kissed her.",
        "Cassie: Well, do you have some kind of a death wish or something? She's insane, Jeffrey. She's a murderer. You have to stay away from her. She's dangerous.",
        "Jeffrey: She might, you know, have a bit of an edge, but...",
        "Cassie: A bit of an edge?!",
        "Jeffrey: Look, I appreciate your concern, okay? But I think I can handle this. Now if you will excuse me?",
        "Cassie: No, we're not finished here.",
        "Dinah: Hello, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: So, I see you and Jeffrey O'Neill are picking up where you left off.",
        "Dinah: Wow, I am so surprised how many people caught that kiss. But it was even more surprising to see how upset it made Cassie.",
        "Edmund: Please, Dinah. You can't be all that surprised by it.",
        "Dinah: I guess. I don't think Cassie wants to see me very happy. I mean why else would she flip out like that just because I was kissing Jeffrey O'Neill?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Um... maybe we should order some room service--have some food for later?",
        "JB: (Sighs) there may not be a later. Look, Tammy, if this isn't what you want...",
        "Tammy: No. Oh, no, I want it. I do. I just want it slower. What are you doing?",
        "JB: Look, I'm not going to pressure you. Okay, you only get one first time. And I want yours to be so special that you'll remember it for the rest of your life. So... I mean, you're not ready. It's obvious. So, I'm going to... I'm going to take off.",
        "Tammy: No! Don't go.",
        "Sandy: Leave her alone.",
        "JB: Why? She's my girl. See.",
        "Tammy: Sandy, what's wrong?",
        "JB: (Laughing) (busy signal)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Has he said anything?",
        "Josh: Yeah, thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate the information. That was the nurse on duty. She said that Sandy has gone back to sleep. So there's no reason for us to go over there right now.",
        "Reva: No. But if he wakes up, I want to be there.",
        "Josh: Reva, he's going to be fine. And that's because of you. You saved his life.",
        "Reva: There's more to this than you could possible imagine.",
        "Josh: Why? Reva, look there's nothing in the world you can't tell me. You know that. So come on now, talk to me.",
        "Reva: Sandy...",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Reva: He's... Sandy's not my son. He's not Jonathan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tony: You got it all taken care of, okay. What else?",
        "Michelle: I don't know. I said good-bye to Robbie. I turned the stove off. I... take care of yourself.",
        "Tony: Don't worry about me. Have fun on your trip and I hope you find what you're looking for.",
        "Michelle: Hey.",
        "Tony: Be safe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Cassie doesn't know about your history with Jeffrey O'Neill. All she sees is you still in town involving yourself with the people she's involved with.",
        "Dinah: You mean involved acquainted with, not involved involved?",
        "Edmund: Which do you like more? Getting under Cassie's skin or getting under mine?",
        "Dinah: Look, this is not going to be too hard to work out. Cassie has a man like you who loves her and is very committed to her. And I have--well, whatever is going on between Jeffrey and me.",
        "Edmund: What exactly is going on between you and Jeffrey?",
        "Dinah: I'm not sure. But let's just say it's probably still a lab experiment. The point is that Cassie and I both have men that we desire. And that's enough. What else would a woman ask for?",
        "Cassie: I am not going to stand by and watch Dinah get her hooks into you.",
        "Jeffrey: You know what? You don't really have much to say in the matter, Mrs. Winslow, you know. You got your own problems, don't you? You got your hotel, you got your family, you got Edmund. I suggest you worry about that.",
        "Cassie: How could you even consider getting involved with her after everything she's done to me? I mean, I thought that you...",
        "Jeffrey: That I what? That I cared about you?",
        "Cassie: Forget it. Forget it. You know, it's none of my business. It's your life. If you want to run it, ruin it. Let's go. Let's just go to Reva's, okay?",
        "Edmund: How are you doing?",
        "Cassie: Fine. Fine. Great. I have an extra shirt up in your suite. I'm going to go get it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Maybe the blood test was wrong.",
        "Reva: They ran it three separate times with the same result. Sandy isn't my son.",
        "Josh: My God.",
        "Reva: I was so shocked. Sandy wasn't.",
        "Josh: What? Wait a minute. Are you telling me that he knew about this all along?",
        "Reva: I think so. (Crying)",
        "Josh: You know, I knew there was something off with that kid from the very beginning. I chalked it up to the way he was raised. You have an abusive father, you're going to shut down.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, I wanted him to feel safe, you know, to trust us.",
        "Josh: So did I, Reva. And we tried the... if we keep working at it hard enough eventually he'll open up strategy.",
        "Reva: No. Please don't be bitter.",
        "Josh: You risked your life for him. That operation could have gone wrong for you, Reva. And after what? After everything we done for him. Bending over backwards to make him feel like he's a part of this family. What was he after do you think? Money? And inside track to the good life? Was that it?",
        "Reva: I don't know. That's why we have to talk to him.",
        "Josh: I do want to talk to him. You want to be there when he opens his eyes? So do I. Let's go. Come on.",
        "Reva: Maybe we can find some answers.",
        "Josh: Maybe so. I don't really care about answers though. Because I'm just basically going to tear his head off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: This is all so new to me. Please don't give up on me. It would kill me if you left.",
        "JB: If you're not ready, you're not ready.",
        "Tammy: I am ready. I am. I keep telling you that. I want to be with you.",
        "JB: Why? What about me makes me so great?",
        "Tammy: I like the way you make me feel.",
        "JB: I make you feel nervous.",
        "Tammy: No. Well, maybe a little but... only because I like you so much. I like the way you talk to me. The way you look at me. And especially the way you touch me. Yeah, like that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: Where's Michelle?",
        "Sebastian: I can't think about them now, okay! I cannot put off this trip. It has to happen now!",
        "Holly: Roger was not a happy man. He was not a good man. He was a monster in more ways than I can count. Look, I know, you think you want to know the truth about him, but think again. You have no idea what you're getting into.",
        "Sebastian: I spent months with him, Holly.",
        "Holly: Months.",
        "Sebastian: Yeah.",
        "Holly: You spent months hearing everything from his point of view. And he could be very persuasive. No one knows that better than I. But sooner or later, everyone who came into contact with him was hurt. And anyone who got to close to his heart such as it was just... it was a crushing burden. It left me just gasping for air.",
        "Sebastian: Well, maybe that burden was better than having nothing at all.",
        "Holly: I doubt it. Roger demanded everything from every part of you. You body, your mind, your... your very soul. And anything less than complete devotion he regarded as betrayal, punishable by banishment or death, according to your offense.",
        "Sebastian: But you loved him, didn't you?",
        "Holly: I was in his thrall. Let's put it that way.",
        "Sebastian: You know what I think? I think that it couldn't have all been bad, otherwise you and your bags, you wouldn't be here. Let's put it that way. (Phone rings)",
        "Holly: Hello? Ross, where is Blake? We're waiting for her. What do you mean she's not coming? She can't get away?",
        "Sebastian: Okay, we're all set to board as soon as Chrissy and Michelle get here.",
        "Holly: Forget it. The trip's off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Wait, wait. Please wait.",
        "Josh: You know, I was just thinking to myself. It's actually a good thing that's he's still here in the hospital, because when I'm done with him, he may require more medical attention.",
        "Reva: Can you just hold on?",
        "Josh: Yeah. You know, you wanted to be here. You wanted to talk to him, we're here.",
        "Reva: He saved Tammy's life. Let's just give him a chance to speak, okay, before we jump to conclusions and make any decisions?",
        "Josh: Honey, he took this family for a ride. He sat with us at our dinner table in our home with that smug smile on his face...",
        "Reva: Enough. Enough, enough.",
        "Josh: Sizing us up.",
        "Reva: Stop. Stop it!",
        "Josh: Thinking of us as marks, Reva.",
        "Reva: Please stop. I know you're upset. I'm upset too, but you have to let me handle this.",
        "Josh: Reva, you...",
        "Reva: I'm going to go in there. I'm going to go in myself.",
        "Josh: Absolutely not.",
        "Reva: No, Joshua, please. Please. I have so many questions. So may things in my head since I found out that he's not Jonathan. He's not my son. You have to let me handle this.",
        "Josh: Go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: What are you doing here?",
        "Dinah: No, no, Tammy... Tammy... look. No, I wouldn't hurt you.",
        "Tammy: What do you want?",
        "Dinah: Uncle Edmund, he... I'm Dinah. Hi.",
        "JB: Who's that?",
        "Tammy: No one you need to worry about. What, are you stalking me or something?",
        "Dinah: No. No, I' m not. It's a long story. But Edmund allowed me to crash here the other night and I forgot something of mine. Do you mind if I just get it? That's all.",
        "Tammy: Get it and get out. What are you going to do? Blab to the world about Cassie's daughter?",
        "Dinah: Relax. I'm not going to rat you out. I know what it's like to be young and in love... or whatever.",
        "JB: Much obliged.",
        "Dinah: Okay. Thank you.",
        "Cassie: Wow, this is perfect. Why am I not surprised that you're hanging around Edmund's suite again, huh?",
        "Dinah: I was just leaving.",
        "Cassie: No, no, no. Not until we get a few things straight, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: All right, you know what? If that's what's going on here, you need to know something right off the bat.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: Whether my sister can come or not, we are going to Santo Domingo. I need to find what my father left there. And so do you.",
        "Holly: You know, maybe we can just wait until Blake can travel. And where's Michelle?",
        "Sebastian: I can't think about them now, okay?! I cannot get out off this trip. It has to happen now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You know your sweet Tammy... don't so much as breathe my daughter's name. Don't say a word. Shut up and listen.",
        "Dinah: Fine.",
        "Cassie: What are you doing sniffing around outside Edmond's suite.",
        "Dinah: I forgot something here the other night when I stayed. That's all. I was coming to pick it up.",
        "Cassie: Really? What else did you take when were you in there.",
        "Dinah: Nothing.",
        "Cassie: Well, let's find out.",
        "Dinah: You know, you don't want me to get too close to Edmund. You don't want me to get too close to Jeffrey. What is it you want?",
        "Tammy: I can't believe this. My mom is out there.",
        "Cassie: You are jealous of me and Jeffrey. That is completely sick. You need to speak someone, get some professional help.",
        "Tammy: They're gone. Dinah really didn't tell my mom that we were in here.",
        "JB: Where were we? Can you refresh my memory?",
        "Tammy: Um, we can't stay here. What if my mother comes back?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Josh. When did you get back?",
        "Josh: A couple of hours ago.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that's good timing, because Reva needs you.",
        "Josh: Oh, I see. You know about what's happened then.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, yeah. Reva asked me to investigate Jonathan's disappearance.",
        "Josh: Well, actually I'm more interested in the non-Jonathan at the moment.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, I can't say I blame you. Especially if the reports that I've been getting should make matters from bad to worse.",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. I just don't want to have to pull Reva aside and confirm to her that Sandy might have killed the real Jonathan.",
        "Reva: See. I told you he's not here! Where is he? Sandy? Oh, Sandy. Sandy.",
        "Reva: Come on. What are you doing?",
        "Sandy: Tammy. Tammy, Tammy...",
        "Reva: You're not suppose to be on your feet. Get back into bed.",
        "Nurse: This is the second time I've caught him trying to leave.",
        "Reva: Shhh. Just lie still. Lie still. Can I have a minute alone with him, please?",
        "Nurse: Sure.",
        "Reva: Shhh. What?",
        "Sandy: Not Jonathan. (Coughs)",
        "Reva: I know. I know you're not. Is that why you were trying to leave?",
        "Sandy: Tam... Tam... Tammy.",
        "Reva: Tammy. Tammy, what? What?",
        "Sandy: Tammy... trouble.",
        "Reva: Tammy? I don't understand. I don't understand. Easy, honey.",
        "Sandy: Trouble.",
        "Reva: Easy. Easy. Easy.",

        "Holly: What's our flying time to Miami?",
        "Sebastian: You are not going to regret this. This is going to be an unforgettable trip. Okay, time to board, ladies. Yeah, we're about ready to depart. Is the boat ready? You're sure? After all the work I put into this, nothing can go wrong. Do you understand? Nothing.",
        "Tony: What kind of work are you talking about, pal?",
        "Airport employee: Excuse me, sir, only private planes leave from this gate.",
        "Tony: Yeah. No. You know I... I knew that. You see the thing is my problem I don't know exactly what airline flies direct to, you know, Miami. You think you could help me out? Huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Dinah, I want you to back off. I want you to stay away from Edmund, Jeffrey, and all the people I care about.",
        "Dinah: So you do care about Jeffrey?",
        "Cassie: He's my friend.",
        "Dinah: And you want a little more, is that it?",
        "Cassie: Stay away. Do you understand?",
        "Dinah: You know, Cassie, I would like to, but you're the one who followed me down here. Look, I know that I did terrible things to you and your family and I have admitted that. But I am trying to move on with my life and that's kind of hard to do with you shadowing me the way you do.",
        "Cassie: I shadow you?",
        "Dinah: Yes. And you rub all of my old mistakes in my face every chance you get. I would like to get passed this. I think that we should try to get over the resentment and the bitterness. It's not healthy to hang on to for either one of us. Think about it.",
        "Cassie: She's unbelievable.",
        "Edmund: Actually, she makes a certain amount of sense.",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, what would be the ideal way to resolve this situation?",
        "Cassie: For Dinah to leave town.",
        "Edmund: Agreed. But she's not going to do that. So the next best thing for us to approximate her leaving town.",
        "Cassie: What does that mean?",
        "Edmund: Steer clear of Dinah and let her steer clear of you.",
        "Cassie: She won't, though.",
        "Edmund: Give her the chance.",
        "Cassie: I have given her chances, Edmund. And I have been haunted by every single one of them.",
        "Edmund: Okay, Cassie, either your spare blouse has the identical stain on it or you didn't make it to the suite.",
        "Cassie: I don't care. Let's just go to Reva's. Come on.",
        "Edmund: Okay, but it'll be a wasted trip. Josh and Reva are at the hospital.",
        "Cassie: Josh is back? Thank God. That's great. Maybe he can handle the whole Sandy situation. Lord knows Jeffrey's going to be busy sticking his tongue down Dinah's throat.",
        "Edmund: Yes and I don't see how that's any concern of yours.",
        "Cassie: Okay, do you have to be so naive? Dinah is trying to do everything she can to get to me, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: And I think she is succeeding. Will you please explain to me, why Jeffrey seeing Dinah affects you?",
        "Cassie: Okay. Because... number one, not that you're happy with it, but Jeffrey is around me all the time. Because number two, he lives at my hotel. And number three, we have a history.",
        "Edmund: So?",
        "Cassie: So? Dinah wants to be a part of that, okay. She wants to leech onto and I'm not going to let her. And that is why it's my business, okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Cassie, you have put me way ahead of schedule. So, on to phase two.",

        "JB: You can bring some of those candles in the bedroom if you want.",
        "Tammy: I'm sorry. It's just too weird staying here knowing that my mom could come back at any second.",
        "JB: Call her.",
        "Tammy: Huh?",
        "JB: Call her. Find out where she is. Maybe you're worrying for no reason.",
        "Tammy: Okay. (Phone rings)",
        "Cassie: Hello?",
        "Tammy: Hi, Mom. Where are you?",
        "Cassie: Hey, sweetie. I'm at Towers. We're heading out. We're getting ready to go to the farm.",
        "Tammy: Great. Bye.",
        "Cassie: Wait. Where are you?",
        "Tammy: I'm just hanging out with Kyra.",
        "Cassie: Everything okay?",
        "Tammy: Everything's great. Bye. You're a genius. And we can stay.",

        "Josh: Sandy killed Jonathan.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, it's just speculation at this point.",
        "Josh: Tell me everything you know about this from the beginning.",
        "Reva: Okay, start again. Tammy?",
        "Sandy: In trouble. With...",
        "Reva: Tammy's in trouble. I wish I understood what you're trying to say. What? Computer. The computer. That's great. You could type what you're trying to say, what you're trying to tell me. Here.",
        "Reva: That's Tammy's new boyfriend.",
        "Sandy: Jonathan.",
        "Reva: No, no, his name is JB",
        "Sandy: Jonathan.",
        "Reva: Oh, my God. This is... this is Jonathan? My...? He's with Tammy. He's with Tammy. But why would he do that? Why would he want to be with Tammy? I don't understand. Does he know she's his cousin.",
        "Sandy: He knows.",
        "Reva: Well, why would he do that?",
        "Sandy: To hurt you.",
        "Reva: We have to find them. Do you have any idea where they are?",
        "Sandy: Not sure.",
        "Reva: Josh is outside. I'll get him and we'll find them. Joshua?! (Crashing sound)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Wait one second. There. Now no one can stop us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Sandy. Oh, my God. Are you okay?",
        "Sandy: I'm coming with you.",
