        "Jonathan: Come on, I can't wait. Grazie, yeah, thanks for all the great music you've been playing. I'm happy to go right on wracking up overseas charges. Look, actually the reason I'm calling is because I'm an alumni, and darn it if I didn't lose track of my dorm mate. His name is Sandy Foster. I was wondering if you'd give me maybe his parents' phone number, address. No, I know there's a privacy policy. That's why I asked you for his parents... look, you're going to make me listen to all that yodeling and then you're just going to blow me off like that? Hello.",
        "Ava: Nice phone manners, boss.",
        "Jonathan: Whatever. What do you want, Ava?",
        "Ava: I was wondering, how about some dinner? Get anything interesting there on Tammy's boyfriend?",
        "Jonathan: No, he's not her boyfriend; he's a safety net. At least that's what Tammy thinks.",
        "Ava: You don't?",
        "Jonathan: No. There's nothing safe about Sandy. Someone needs to show Tammy that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Fallon: Sorry, I have no idea where it came from or what it means.",
        "Sandy: It's your job to protect me and deal with these issues before they show up again.",
        "Fallon: I've done the best I can.",
        "Sandy: Well, that's not good enough. I need to know how this note got here so I can protect Tammy from all of it. There's a lot at stake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Please, God, just have him be okay and I'll never see Jonathan again. A promise is a promise, Tammy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Billy. Just wait a minute, please! Okay, listen, you don't want to go into an AA meeting, that's fine. That's... find a dirty movie or something to go to.",
        "Billy: If I was going to go out and get loaded, there's nothing you can do about it, right?",
        "Reva: Don't you think I know that? Let's go somewhere else. I don't know. Tear me apart, make fun of me, whatever. That always makes you feel better.",
        "Billy: Are we going to just square dance like this...",
        "Reva: I'm going to do it until I'm convinced that you're back on your feet.",
        "Billy: What makes you think I'm not?",
        "Reva: Billy, your son is on his way out of the country. You haven't talked to Mindy in months. You're barely on speaking terms with your brother, business is a mess, not to mention your love life.",
        "Billy: Oh, let's talk about your love life.",
        "Reva: I don't want to do that, either. You know, you're just going to have to face the fact, Billy, that I'm all you've got. ( Laughs ) It's just you and me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: I'm glad you're home and I'm just so glad to see you walk through that door.",
        "Bill: Olivia, I need to talk to you.",
        "Olivia: Let me finish this, please. I know you're angry, God, you have a right to be angry. We can fix this, we always do. We just need to lock the door, you know, and shut everything and everyone out and just concentrate on us for a while. Can we do that?",
        "Bill: Where's Emma?",
        "Olivia: Sleeping. She wanted to stay up and give her daddy a good night kiss.",
        "Bill: Well, I had to be with my father.",
        "Olivia: How is he doing?",
        "Bill: How's he doing? Do me a favor, will you? Don't pretend that you give a damn because if you did, you never would have slipped him that drink.",
        "Olivia: It was a stupid, heartless mistake. I can't defend it, I can't. But I can fix it, I can fix it. We can fix this. We can. I'll do anything, anything, for your father, for you, for us. Please, please. Know how sorry I am for what I did, please.",
        "Bill: See, that's it. That's it with you. Olivia, time and time again you are always sorry but you're just never sorry enough to change.",
        "Olivia: That's not true because I am so much better with you. I'm so much better. With you at my side I can get there, I can!",
        "Bill: I cannot do this anymore. I can't. I won't.",
        "Olivia: You won't what?",
        "Bill: I'm leaving.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Excuse me, Hi. You're Sandy's nurse, Sandy Foster. I'm his...",
        "Nurse: Girlfriend, of course. You've been here day and night.",
        "Tammy: I know it's a little bit strange to ask, but I was wondering if you could do me a favor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: I spent a long time building a life for myself here and I'm not about to lose what I have.",
        "Fallon: I understand.",
        "Sandy: Good. Now you should probably go before Tammy sees you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Okay, Sandy. I said I would fight for a second chance. Here's Round One.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: You're leaving?",
        "Bill: Yes, I'm leaving.",
        "Olivia: It was a little mistake.",
        "Bill: A little mistake?",
        "Olivia: Okay, right, all right. But that's it. That's it? You're gone.",
        "Bill: Olivia, I have to go to Venezuela. Tonight. I mean, someone's got to steer this project for Lewis, right? You're the one that got me the job.",
        "Olivia: You don't to go alone. Emma and I could pack our things; we could go with you.",
        "Bill: I need a break, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: A break from me?",
        "Bill: If I stay here, Olivia, I don't know how this is all going to come out and it's the last thing that I want and I'm sure you don't want it, either. And for her to feel that, I don't want it.",
        "Olivia: I ran away after Phillip was murdered, you remember what you said to me? You said we could beat anything as long as we were together. You said that!",
        "Bill: Yes.",
        "Olivia: And I put faith in that and you, and you were right.",
        "Bill: That's exactly it, baby. I would have fought the world for you. But the one thing I can't fight is you.",
        "Olivia: So what is... what is this? What are we going to call this? Are we separating?",
        "Bill: You know what? Call it what you want, really. I just... all I know is I cannot be here. I cannot be with you right now, I'm sorry. I have no answers for you, but I can't. I can't do this. I can't do this.",
        "Olivia: I need you. Emma needs you. You can't just leave us like this. We have so much together.",
        "Bill: You know what? That's exactly what I used to think. But now I think we'd better step back, try to figure out what we do have.",
        "Olivia: I can't believe this! Why are you doing this?",
        "Bill: This is no longer about you and me now, Olivia. This is no longer about us. This is about Lewis now. I promised Josh that I would run this thing. And if this deal falls apart, it's going to kill my father and if he starts to blame himself... I can't have that. So you got what you wanted. Bill's got to step up and take care of business again, right? Right?",
        "Olivia: I didn't want this.",
        "Bill: Well, you should have thought of that before you set my father up because now... it's just so... why couldn't you just believe?",
        "Olivia: Why can't you see how sorry I am? Why can't you... don't you see how much I regret what I did?",
        "Bill: Yeah. Yeah, I do and I think you're sorry and I think it hurts.",
        "Olivia: Then stay. Stay. You stay or I may not be waiting for you when you get back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Come on, Billy, I'm going to show you that we can have fun anywhere. We need a couple of margaritas on the rocks, no salt.",
        "Billy: Ooh, I love you.",
        "Reva: Make them both virgins.",
        "Billy: Ah.",
        "Reva: I mean, I know there's a few things we can't do anymore, no more booze, no more pit mashing.",
        "Billy: What?",
        "Reva: And no more pretending to be a couple of virgins.",
        "Billy: That's something I've never done. But I think the reverse is definitely out.",
        "Reva: It's okay, though. I think I can live with that because there are a few things that I have learned since then. Looks good. Here's to wisdom.",
        "Billy: Here's to old virgins. ( Laughter )",
        "Josh: What the hell are you doing? What's the matter? Are you encouraging him to drink now? That's a good idea.",
        "Reva: Relax! It's margarita mix on the rocks, no salt.",
        "Josh: Okay. All right. I apologize.",
        "Billy: Whatever.",
        "Josh: I'm just trying to help, okay.",
        "Billy: Look, even if I was drinking, I wouldn't want your help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: These letter are Sandy's.",
        "Jonathan: Ava, mind your business.",
        "Ava: You know what? It is so annoying and such a drag to be around you when you're miserable. Not that you're not fantastic at it, because you are. But the problem is you take it out on everyone else.",
        "Jonathan: Just whoever's around, Ava.",
        "Ava: You know what you should do? You should leave what's his name alone. He's not worth your time. And you should find out how you can get you-know-who to admit it.",
        "Jonathan: Admit what?",
        "Ava: Admit that she loves you back.",
        "Jonathan: Come on, Sandy, there's got to be something in here that will give me a clue. Bills, bills, junk mail. No letter from somebody who knew you before you came into my life?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Fallon: Thank you for putting a rush on this.",
        "Waitress: I hope your friend's not too sick to enjoy it.",
        "Fallon: Looks like he's pulling through. That's okay. It was a freak accident. He was electrocuted.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Nurse Tiffany, wow! Hey, what's... where are you going? I don't understand. Tammy:( Sighs ) I think you do. And you know what this is, too, don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Look, I'm sorry. I jumped to the wrong conclusions. I have to be honest here, I don't see evidence that you're ready jump back on the wagon.",
        "Billy: I don't care one tiny little bit.",
        "Josh: Oh, come on!",
        "Reva: Enough, all right?",
        "Josh: You can't blame me for thinking the worst here. Reva, we both know he's out of control right now. You're the one that's going to help him? That's great.",
        "Reva: Excuse me? You don't think I can help Billy?",
        "Josh: I think you have to figure out how to help yourself before you start helping other people.",
        "Billy: Ooh.",
        "Reva: Remind me to write that down.",
        "Billy: I think you should start your church somewhere else little brother.",
        "Reva: Hallelujah.",
        "Billy: We're sinners, we know it, we like it. Besides, hey, you've been advising me. Do you think when you play this great God Josh routine, you make it really tough on everyone else around.",
        "Josh: Well, your son is working on his family, he's going to do a great job in that project in Venezuela. I have to go. I have to give him a ride to the airport. See you.",
        "Reva: You know what? Why don't we all go?",
        "Josh: No, no. I don't think it that's a good idea.",
        "Reva: Josh, what whatever's happening, whatever's going on here with all of us, we're family first and foremost. So what do you say, Billy?",
        "Billy: Yeah.",
        "Reva: Let's go get your kid off on his journey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Where'd you get that?",
        "Tammy: You had it with you the night of the accident. You had everything planned, didn't you? You were going to bring me up here to see the lights and the stars. And then ask me to marry you, right?",
        "Sandy: Yes.",
        "Tammy: I would've said yes, Sandy. And I would've meant it. If that night had gone how it should, I would have said yes and I would have been so happy, Sandy. So happy to be your wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Fallon: It's Fallon. Sorry to call so late but I have an emergency. I have a document I need dusted any chance you have an opening for me? I'll need an I.D. on the prints if there are any.",
        "Nurse: Sir, turn your cell phone off, please.",
        "Fallon: I've got to call you back. There must be some place around here to make a phone call.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Even now, a moment like this you're still playing the game.",
        "Olivia: It's not a game.",
        "Bill: Well you gave me an ultimatum, didn't you? That's very interesting.",
        "Olivia: I am trying to save our marriage, okay? We can't do this if we're apart! This is going to kill us. We can't piece our live together by phone or fax.",
        "Bill: So you'll get me to stay by making threats?",
        "Olivia: Why can't you understand I'm trying to fight for us! For this marriage that you said you love so much that made you so happy. For better or for worse. What happened to that? I made a mistake, a big mistake!",
        "Bill: You made a mistake?",
        "Olivia: A big mistake! I get that! Why... why don't you be honest with me.",
        "Bill: What?",
        "Olivia: How long have you been waiting for me to screw up... no, how long have you been waiting for me to screw up so you could bail out on me. How long?",
        "Bill: Olivia, don't you do this. This is what you do. You turn the tables and make it all about you and that's what got us into this mess. How many times, baby, how many times have I told you I love you and you are all that I need.",
        "Olivia: They're just words.",
        "Bill: Olivia, Olivia, I adopted Emma. That alone, don't you see? That alone should say it all. But no. No. That wasn't good enough? Why was that not good enough for you?",
        "Olivia: Was, Bill, it is, it is!",
        "Bill: It wasn't. It wasn't. Maybe it's my mistake. I thought I could change you. I mean there is something... there is something so empty, so hungry, so needy in inside you that it just doesn't stop. It doesn't let you stop! And I have no idea what it is, but I know what it did to us, Olivia, and I can't, I cannot do this anymore. I just cannot do this for another day.",
        "( Knock on the door )",
        "Olivia: Don't get it, just leave it alone.",
        "Bill: Josh.",
        "Reva: We're here to give you a big sendoff.",
        "Bill: Okay. That's great.",
        "Olivia: Isn't this just a kick. The Lewis family is here. This is a big day for you. You're getting what you want. You're taking my husband away from me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Listen, Tammy...",
        "Tammy: I love every second when we're together. And when we're not together, I think how about it will be when we are and I love that, too, Sandy. And I love how your eyes seem to get even bluer any time you're happy. And how when you hold me, it feels so right, like nothing could hurt me.",
        "Sandy: I've tried really hard to make you feel safe with me.",
        "Tammy: You never had to try. Did you know that some nights while you're sleeping, I put my head on your chest and listen to your heart beating so strong and so fast that I swear my heart changes rhythm just to match it so that they beat together. What happened with Jonathan... we need to work to get past that, I know but I know we can. We can help one another and...",
        "Sandy: What?",
        "Tammy: I made a promise, not just to myself and not just to you, the kind that you can't break. A vow. Look, give me the chance to live up to that vow and I know in my soul, Sandy, that we will be happy together as husband and wife. Sandy, that... that's what I want. I just hope that it's still what you want, too.",
        "Sandy: I do. I want this. I want you. And I believe what you said about Jonathan and not looking back.",
        "Tammy: Then what's holding you back, Sandy? Right now.",
        "Sandy: I want you to take care of everything so that I don't face criminal charges.",
        "Tammy: Sandy, please tell me that we can get past this. I know I can. But can you? Can you ask me the question you wanted to ask me before the accident?",
        "Sandy: I wish I could.",
        "Tammy: Just let go of everything. You can. Look at me. It's me. You can do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Well, come on, let's get the party started! This is a big day for you. Oh, my goodness, you're finally getting what you wanted.",
        "Bill: Olivia.",
        "Olivia: No, no, they have never wanted us together. They prayed we would break up. And Reva just holds a grudge because Josh and I were together.",
        "Reva: Well, I can't argue you with there.",
        "Josh: Wait a minute. What is this?",
        "Reva: Bill's leaving town.",
        "Josh: It's a job, Olivia, he can fly back and forth whenever he likes.",
        "Reva: If he likes.",
        "Bill: Josh, thank you for the ride to the airport, but I'll just take a cab. I need to speak with Olivia. Um... thanks, Dad. Dad, I really need to talk to her alone so I'll call you later okay?",
        "Billy: Okay.",
        "Josh: What was that?",
        "Reva: I think that was Bill and Olivia splitting up.",
        "Josh: I thought they were fine, though. I mean, how...",
        "Reva: How? How do things like this happen?",
        "Billy: Yeah, I mean, that's a good question.",
        "Josh: Okay. I'm going to get a bite to eat. Anybody wants to join me, I'm buying.",
        "Billy: Oh, no, we already are booked. We got plans, right?",
        "Reva: Yeah. That's right. We got plans.",
        "Billy: Yeah. Let's hit the trail.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Well, you've got to admit, they enjoyed it. I mean, they've been trying to split us up from the beginning.",
        "Bill: Don't do that.",
        "Olivia: Well, it's true.",
        "Bill: No one could have split us up. I told you that over and over no matter how many times you felt insecure or couldn't trust me, I said the only one that could ever get between us was you. And that's it. But that wasn't enough for you, was it? That wasn't enough for you, was it? There's always Philip or Josh or my father or anyone else who you felt didn't like you or respect you or trust you and those people and those feelings. They were always there, weren't they? And they always are. And that's why there's no room left for me. Right?",
        "Olivia: Don't.",
        "Bill: Right?",
        "Olivia: No. Yes.",
        "Emma: Daddy!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I know that you love me.",
        "Sandy: No big secret.",
        "Tammy: If you still do, Sandy if that hasn't changed...",
        "Sandy: If I still love you? If I still want to spend the rest of my life with you?",
        "Tammy: Still?",
        "Sandy: I don't think I can ever love anyone else, Tammy. You're my home. You're my family. And I don't doubt for a split second that I can protect you from anything and everything. I know I can protect you.",
        "Tammy: So is that a yes? Can we... ( Cell phone rings ) Sandy?",
        "Sandy: Sorry. I'm sorry. I've got to answer this.",
        "Tammy: Can't we just...",
        "Sandy: I've been waiting for this. I'm sorry. Hello?",
        "Fallon: Good news.",
        "Sandy: Tell me.",
        "Fallon: The nurse who delivered the note to you wasn't the same nurse who found it. I already tracked her down and I suspect she was actually handed the note.",
        "Sandy: Do you know who handed her the note?",
        "Fallon: Apparently there were...",
        "Jonathan: Didn't you hear you're not supposed to use the phone at the hospital?",
        "Fallon: What are you doing?",
        "Jonathan: Simmer down. How about talking to me for a few minutes, that sound like fun?",
        "Fallon: Do I know you?",
        "Jonathan: No. We have an old friend in common, though.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Call them back.",
        "Sandy: No, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have answered that anyway, not when we're in the middle of this.",
        "Tammy: Well, I still don't know what you're thinking. You haven't answered my question or asked me to answer yours.",
        "Sandy: Soon, okay? Trust me. The way you're asking me to trust you and what we have. I'll work something out first and then we'll have this conversation again.",
        "Tammy: When?",
        "Sandy: Soon.",
        "Tammy: When, Sandy?",
        "Sandy: I'll just hold on to this until the time is right, okay?",
        "Sandy: Can I just ask you one question?",
        "Sandy: Sure.",
        "Tammy: It's Jonathan, isn't it? He's still what's holding you back, what's holding us back.",
        "Sandy: Nurse Tiffany, perfect timing. Thank you guys so much for this surprise. Should we go?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: I know where I know you from now. Switzerland, right? You're the guy that used to come visit Sandy Foster in boarding school.",
        "Fallon: I still don't remember you, so...",
        "Jonathan: Hey, look, you showing up here is exactly what I was hoping for. I need to ask you questions.",
        "Fallon: I'm late for another appointment.",
        "Jonathan: You're afraid? Well you should be afraid. The good news is we have a lot of doctors and nurses here if you need them. The bad news is if you don't answer these questions, we are going to need them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Good night.",
        "Nurse: Good night.",
        "Sandy: Fallon, it's Sandy, and I want you call me. I need to know what you found out about that note.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

I'm going to send you some presents and I'm going to send you some gifts. I'm going to send you so many that that mailman is going so get tired.
