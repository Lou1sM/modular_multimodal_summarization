        "Jonathan: Tammy. ",
        "Nate: Just call me Grandpa. ",
        "Jonathan: You are not here. You\r\nare dead. ",
        "Nate: Dead. Yeah. Nearly as dead\r\nas you're going to be, huh? It won't be long now, will it? You must be shaking\r\nin your knickers. ",
        "Jonathan: Leave me alone. Go back\r\nto hell or wherever it is that you came from. ",
        "Nate: Ooh, you are scared. More\r\nscared than you were of the water. Well, fair enough. You know what's inside\r\nyou, don't you? We both do. ",
        "Jonathan: I'll be a good dad. I'm\r\nready. ",
        "Nate: Just like I was ready to\r\ngive up my whole life for some snotty little ingrate. ",
        "Jonathan: It's different with me.\r\nYou hated me from the day I came to live with you. ",
        "Nate: No. Not true, actually. I\r\nwas happy, at first. Cute baby, easy to control. It was later, Johnny, later,\r\nthat the anger, the resentment, started to grow. ",
        "Jonathan: I'm not like you. I\r\nwould never hurt my kid. Plus, I have everything that I ever wanted. Tammy and\r\nmy baby, too. ",
        "Nate: If you say so. You'll see, Johnny\r\nboy. You'll see. ",
        "Lizzie: Are you okay? Did you have a\r\nnightmare? ",
        "Jonathan: Huh? ",
        "Lizzie: Nightmare? ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Yeah. Not real. What are you\r\ndoing up so early? ",
        "Lizzie: We have childbirth class. You're\r\nstill into it, right? ",
        "Nate: Doesn't that sound like fun?\r\n",
        "Jonathan: Maybe it will be. ",
        "Nate: Oh, Johnny you're going soft\r\nheaded. Don't tell me you're becoming one of those warm and fuzzy new age\r\nidiots, going through all the breathing and the hand holding when really you\r\nshould be letting the mummy do what's natural which is spitting the bloody\r\nthing out, all by herself while you're down the pub with the other new dads. I\r\nmean, come on, just pretend you're a man, just once, please. ",
        "Lizzie: Jonathan. You're still coming to\r\nclass, right? ",
        "Jonathan: Sure. Yeah. ",
        "Lizzie: I hope you're not freaked out about\r\nthis. ",
        "Nate: Just here to lend a little\r\nmoral support, a little pat on the back if you need it. Don't thank me, it's my\r\njob as your father. ",
        "Jonathan: Thank you for giving a\r\ndamn about being my dad. ",
        "Nate: No. Come to think of it, I\r\ndidn't give a damn most of the time but every now and again a man feels a\r\ntwinge of conscience, a need to step up. ",
        "Jonathan: What you need to do is\r\nget out of my head and let me do what you have to do, okay? ",
        "Nate: Fine. I'll be around\r\nflirting with pretty nurse if you change your mind, decide that you need your\r\nfather. ",
        "Lizzie: Are you coming? ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. You know, I was thinking,\r\nwould you rather do this with your mom? ",
        "Lizzie: With my mom? ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. She's had babies I mean, you\r\nknow, she could be there for you in a way that I couldn't, she could give you\r\nadvice. ",
        "Lizzie: Are you trying to back out of this? ",
        "Jonathan: No, no, no, no, I know you love\r\nyour mom. I know you guys haven't been getting along that good lately so I\r\nthought this class would be a good way to get back together. I hate classes. \r\n",
        "Lizzie: You're going to be great. Besides, I\r\nneed you. I can't do this without a partner. ",
        "Jonathan: I am. Yeah. I'm in, all way in. I\r\nam. I just hope I don't, you know.... ",
        "Lizzie: Don't what? ",
        "Lillian: Hi, everyone. Lizzie. Hi. The\r\nnormal nurse who teaches this is-- had an emergency so I'm going to fill in\r\ntoday and as my granddaughter can tell you, I've had a lot of experience with\r\nbabies so I think before we get started it might be fun to get to know each other,\r\nintroduce ourselves, and talk about the pregnancy. I think we should start with\r\nthe dads. How about you? ",
        "Mike: Me? I'm Mike. ",
        "Lillian: Any other children? ",
        "Mike: No, this is our first. And I'll admit\r\nit, it kind of scares me. ",
        "Lillian: Why? ",
        "Mike: I've never even held a baby before. ",
        "Lillian: Well, don't worry. They won't\r\nbreak. I promise. And we'll be teaching you about it but I've seen a lot of\r\nnervous fathers and the minute they get that baby in their arms, they just know\r\nwhat to do. It's sort of instinctual, you know? I mean if you and your partner\r\nare united, if you're working together as a couple, and... then having a baby\r\nis the greatest thing that will ever happen in your life. ",
        "Lillian: Okay, now we're going to deal with\r\nsome baby basics. Do I have any volunteers? Just all jump up and get excited.\r\nAll right. I'm going to have to pick somebody then. ",
        "Jonathan: We'll do it. ",
        "Lizzie: Really? ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. How hard could it be? ",
        "Lillian: Okay. Right now we're going to talk\r\nabout holding the baby. So Jonathan, you show me how you would hold your baby\r\ngirl. All right. You want to hold the baby's head, head, and the baby's bottom,\r\nthe butt, alright. ",
        "Jonathan: Okay. ",
        "Lillian: And you want to keep the baby close\r\nto you, swaddle it. Because that's the way you bond with the baby. ",
        "Jonathan: Like this? ",
        "Lillian: That's a little too close, but it's\r\nokay. All right now pretend little baby is asleep and that the crib in is right\r\nin front of you and I want you to gently put the baby in the crib. Good. That's\r\nright. Good, perfect. One thing you want to do is have the baby sleep on its\r\nback because tummy sleeping is a problem with SIDS. Jonathan, gently. That's\r\nmy great granddaughter you're flipping over like a pancake. This is good. ",
        "Jonathan: Who the hell is Sid? ",
        "Lizzie: You're doing great. Really. ",
        "",
        "Lillian: Jonathan and Lizzie, you never,\r\never, turn away even for a second when you're bathing a baby. ",
        "Jonathan: Oh. That's cool. Look. She swims\r\nlike a fish. Like a mermaid. Go get them, girl. ",
        "",
        "Lizzie: Do you remember how to do this? ",
        "Jonathan: (Groaning) Yeah. ",
        "Lizzie: Uh-huh, uh-huh. ",
        "Jonathan: What? ",
        "Lizzie: You want to lift the baby with both\r\nfeet, see? And you want to be sure to wipe from front to back to avoid\r\nbacterial contamination. ",
        "Jonathan: Shouldn't the mom be doing that? ",
        "Lillian: Oh, come on, you're going to share\r\nthe joys of parenthood and the mom's not always there. ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. ",
        "Jonathan: No, I'm saying we're having a\r\ngirl, is she going to have... ",
        "Lillian: Oh my lord, I have sure I am sure\r\nyou have seen girls. ",
        "Lizzie: You're really doing great. ",
        "",
        "(Making the breathing sounds) ",
        "Lizzie: After the baby is born, we can make\r\nall the rounds. ",
        "Jonathan: The rounds? ",
        "Lizzie: Travel. Introduce her to all the\r\nfamily you haven't met yet. ",
        "Jonathan: When this baby is born I'm moving\r\nback in with Tammy, remember? ",
        "Lizzie: Well, not right away. ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. This is a temporary thing. ",
        "Lizzie: You have to bond with the baby\r\nfirst. You can't just walk away from her the second she's born. ",
        "Jonathan: I will. I'll be around, but I've\r\ngot to get back to Tammy and my real life. ",
        "Lizzie: Not right away. We need you. ",
        "Jonathan: Tammy needs me, too. ",
        "Lizzie: Not like we do. This is your little\r\ngirl, Jonathan. What about her first smile, her first laugh? I mean don't you\r\nwant to be around for that? ",
        "Jonathan: I will. I'm not abandoning the\r\nbaby. ",
        "Lizzie: Just me. ",
        "Jonathan: Don't you even make this sound\r\nlike a breakup. You know this marriage is a fake, it's been that way since day\r\none. ",
        "Lizzie: I know. I know all that, okay? It\r\nfeels like you just can't wait to get away from me. ",
        "Jonathan: Stop, stop it, stop it.\r\nGrandmother's going to come and don't cry. Okay? I just, you know what it's\r\nbeen like for me and Tammy not to be able to see each other? ",
        "Lizzie: You've seemed okay. ",
        "Jonathan: I'm not okay. Tammy's not okay.\r\nWe're-- the only way we're going to be okay is when we get together. ",
        "Lizzie: Ow. ",
        "Jonathan: Here we go. Conversation goes\r\nsomewhere you don't like and you start pouring on the guilt. ",
        "Lizzie: No, I'm not faking it. Something\r\ndoesn't feel right. ",
        "Jonathan: Oh wifey, you know, this is me\r\nyou're pulling the trick on. I invented this gag. ",
        "Lizzie: I feel like I'm going to pass out. ",
        "Jonathan: Here it comes. ",
        "Lizzie: Jonathan, wait. ",

        "Jonathan: Come on, Tammy, pick up, pick up. ",
        "Recording: 555-1376 has been disconnected. No\r\nforwarding number is available. 555-... ",
        "Nate: Don't give up now, son. ",
        "Jonathan: No, never. ",
        "Nate: Knock some sense into you,\r\ndidn't I? Johnny, you don't belong in the classroom, mate. Not with all of\r\nthose normal people. ",
        "Jonathan: No, you took care of\r\nthat. I'll never belong with normal people again. ",
        "Nate: Normal's so overrated, don't you find? As is\r\nbeing a heroic daddy. Little Lizzie, she's got plenty of people that are more\r\nthan qualified to look after her during her special time. You, you've got\r\nsomeone who's ready, willing and more than able to look after you. Tammy.\r\nTender, tasty Tammy. If I wasn't so indisposed, dead, I'd have a go with her\r\nmyself. (Grunting) ",
        "Remy: What is going on here? ",
        "Remy: What is going on here? ",
        "Jonathan: You, your idea? ",
        "Remy: You have to slow down and tell me what\r\nyou're talking about. ",
        "Jonathan: Disconnecting Tammy' cell phone\r\nnumber so I can't get in touch with her! ",
        "Remy: Didn't she ask you to stay away? ",
        "Jonathan: This is not going to work. None of\r\nthis is going to work, okay? Tammy can live with you, she can eat with you, she\r\ncan carpool with you. End of the day: Still mine. Always will be. ",
        "Remy: Still mine. Is that what you say\r\nbefore you club her and drag you off to your cave? ",
        "Jonathan: Enjoy it now. Enjoy it because the\r\nbaby's going to be born pretty soon. ",
        "Remy: And everything's going to go back to\r\nnormal. You really believe that? You really believe Tammy\u2019s going to run back\r\nto you, and your wife and your baby won\u2019t get in the way? ",
        "Jonathan: Mind your business. ",
        "Remy: I told you, I told you I had a feeling\r\nTammy would be available soon. That I'd wait things out. Looks like I was right\r\nbecause she's living with me, not you. ",
        "Jonathan: Okay. You are pushing it. You are\r\npushing if you look at her, if you talk to her in the wrong way, I will come\r\nafter you. Yeah? ",
        "Remy: Won't have time. Too busy changing\r\ndiapers. You have a good day today. ",
        "Nate: Oh, my. I didn't think she\r\nhad it in her. I always thought Tammy would stay true to her outlaw, but looks\r\nlike she found herself a lawman. Officer's Boudreau's quite right, Johnny.\r\nLiving in a dream world. ",
        "Jonathan: You, are the dream. What\r\nTammy and I have is a real deal. ",
        "Nate: This is real. Hold me. ",
        "Jonathan: You're sick. ",
        "Nate: (Laughs) Feed me. School\r\nme. Discipline me. Fun part. You bad baby! You ruined my life. ",
        "Jonathan: Nice. Nice. It's not\r\ngoing to be like that. You're psychotic. ",
        "Nate: If you learn anything at\r\nall? ",
        "Jonathan: Get away from me! ",
        "Nate: Johnny, your life is never\r\ngoing to be the same. Tammy, she's living with Officer Boudreau. How long\r\nbefore she's shagging him? ",
        "Jonathan: She's not going to shag\r\nhim. ",
        "Nate: Oh, Johnny, Johnny, come on.\r\nCome on, you can feel it, I know you can. Whole life is just slipping away. \r\n",
        "Jonathan: No. ",
        "Nate: When it's gone what will you\r\nhave then? Who will you be, then? ",

        "Marina: So I hear this click, click, click, click, bang.\r\nRemy, cleaning his service revolver, almost shoots his foot off. ",
        "Tammy: Wow. Or something else. ",
        "Marina: Yuck. So when we finally get all moved in, we need\r\nto have a little talk about house rules. ",
        "Tammy: Rules? ",
        "Marina: Yeah, I need some rules to protect Marina's delicate eyes. I know I may have grown up in a\r\nhouse full of men, but I'm not ready to walk in on you and Remy conserving\r\nwater. Showering together? ",
        "Tammy: Oh, not, not going to happen. ",
        "Marina: Oh, come on. I'm not saying a blame you, I just say\r\nI want some fair warning. ",
        "Tammy: I told you, Remy and I are not\r\nhooking up. ",
        "Marina: Right. Why would you want to, you know? I mean, God,\r\nhe's hot, he's nice, he's totally crazy about you. You're right, that's\r\ndisgusting. ",
        "Tammy: Stop, zip it. I'm going back to my\r\nplace, picking up more stuff. I'll meet you at the apartment. ",
        "Marina: But the food's going to get cold. ",
        "Tammy: Well, plug in the microwave and I'll\r\nnuke it while I'm unpacking. ",
        "Marina: All right. ",
        "Tammy: See you later. ",
        "Marina: See you. ",

        "Jonathan: I can't, anymore than you can stay\r\naway from me. ",
        "Tammy: You have a child on the way. You just\r\nlet me live my life. ",
        "Jonathan: You don't have a life without me.\r\nWe tried to break up before. It didn't work. ",

        "Jonathan: I never hurt you. ",
        "Tammy: You are. Every time you put your arms\r\naround Lizzie, every time I hear her call you her husband. Every time I think\r\nabout you being tied to her forever through a child, that hurts. Don't you get\r\nit, Jonathan? I wanted that with you. Instead, I stood by... ",
        "Jonathan: Don't you think I wanted that with\r\nyou? ",
