        "Reva: Jack... I mean, Josh! What are you \r\ndoing here?",
        "Josh: I have business with Alan. What are you \r\ndoing here?",
        "Reva: I guess I have business with Alan, too.",
        "Josh: You don\u2019t sound so sure.",
        "Reva: It's just that some things have \r\nhappened in the last couple of days that need some clarification.",
        "Josh: Okay, don't... Don't tell me, okay? Let \r\nme guess, the harbor project, right?",
        "Reva: No, not exactly. It's... It's a little \r\nmore involved than that. I guess you could say I'm looking for the truth.",
        "Josh: The truth about what?",
        "Reva: Oh, just business, some old business \r\nfrom the past.",
        "Josh: I see.",
        "Reva: And what about you? I mean, I know that \r\nAlan financed the harbor project, but I thought that that was Olivia\u2019s \r\nterritory.",
        "Josh: Oh, no. with Alan, it's always about \r\nterritory, marking it. I was marking mine.",
        "Reva: Is this about Alan and Olivia? Just \r\nforget that. (Laughs) I promised I\u2019d keep my nose out of it and I'm going to \r\nhonor that promise. ",
        "Josh: Are we here for the same reason?",
        "Reva: I don't know what you mean.",
        "Josh: Well, I had to talk to Alan about \r\nOlivia, and I'm starting to get the feeling that you're here for the same thing.",

        "\r\nMarah: Tony's the one. All along it was Tony?",
        "Sam:Yes.",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nTony: You told her it was you, right? You're the one who got her old man out of \r\ntrouble, right?",
        "Romeo: Yes. I'm the one.",
        "Tony: You never said anything about me?",
        "Romeo: Look, as far as she knows, you never \r\neven saw the photograph.",
        "Tony: Then why is she looking at me like \r\nthat?",
        "Romeo: She's in love. Look, I'm giving it to \r\nyou straight. I took all the credit. I left you completely out of it.",
        "Tony: Then what's going on?",
        "Romeo: I don't know. Go find out. Go on, I \r\ncan tell you want to.",
        "Tony: What I want is some birthday cake, all \r\nright?",

        "\r\nMarah: How could you?",
        "Sam: Marah, please...",
        "Marah: No, no, no. I got to go. I can\u2019t... I \r\ncan't be here any longer.",
        "Catalina: Go on. Go after her. You're just \r\ngoing to let Marah walk out of your life? Is that what you want?",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nRick: I'm sorry. What did you say?",
        "Harley: Marry me.",
        "Rick: That... That's what I thought you said.",
        "Harley: I love you Rick, and I know that you \r\nlove me. Okay, maybe we're not exactly in love, but we could have a great \r\nmarriage together, you know, one that's built o friendship and trust and love \r\nfor our son. We could give Jude the best home any kid could want. And maybe we \r\ncould both use this right now.",
        "Rick: So you... You decided all of this...",
        "Harley: I've been thinking about it for a \r\nlong time.",
        "Rick: Oh?",
        "Harley: Yeah, actually since the first time \r\nthat you proposed to me. You know, we've both been so scattered lately and \r\ndirectionless and confused and... That's why we got together in the first place, \r\nright? You were lonely and so was I. We needed each other. And really, I've just \r\ngotten to the point where I'm tired of making mistakes, you know. I'm tired of \r\ngoing after the wrong thing for the wrong reasons all the time. I just... I want \r\nto make the right choice and I feel like I am, so say yes, Rick. Please say yes.",
        "Rick: Well, you want to marry me because I\u2019m \r\nthe only one in this relationship that can cook, right?",
        "Harley: I thought this is what you wanted \r\never since you found out I was having your baby, you've been pushing me for some \r\nsort of a commitment, well, here it is.",
        "Rick: Yes, here it is.",
        "Harley: I'd make a great wife.",
        "Rick: Oh, I know.",
        "Harley: I'd make a great partner.",
        "Rick: I don't doubt that. I know, but \r\nsomething's just not right here.",
        "Harley: Okay, you want me on my knees, is \r\nthat what it is? You want a big...",
        "Rick: No, no.",
        "Harley: ...Big thing...",
        "Rick: It's much more than that, Harley, Come \r\non. When I proposed to you a couple of months ago, you turned me down flat. You \r\nsaid to me that you could never marry somebody that you weren't in love with. \r\nRemember that? I made every single argument that you just made, and you refuted \r\nevery single bit of it, every single bit of it. And now, you reverse yourself. \r\nYou've done a complete 180, and that's not you. You're not wishy-washy. Once you \r\nmade up your mind, that's it. So, come on. Something has happened with you in \r\nthe last couple of months, something big.\u00a0 So what did it, Harley? What made you \r\nwant to marry me? ",
        "Harley: What made me want to marry you?",
        "Rick: Mm-hmm.",
        "Harley: Well, I\u2019ve been thinking about this \r\nfor months and months. You know, for the first time in my life, I feel like I\u2019m \r\nmaking a decision based on just months of looking inward, you know, of weighing \r\nthe pros and the cons.",
        "Rick: And I just finally came on top?",
        "Harley: Okay, um, you want to know what it \r\nreally was?",
        "Rick: Yeah, that would be nice.",
        "Harley: The moment that really cemented it \r\nfor me?",
        "Rick: That would be great.",
        "Harley: It was when I saw you in the jail \r\ncell holding Jude in your arms for the first time. You had a look of such joy on \r\nyour face. And I was so proud that I was able to give you that, Rick. I've never \r\nseen you that happy in my life and I know that because of this boy we can be \r\nhappy together.",
        "Rick: When I proposed to you a couple of \r\nmonths ago, I didn't have a doubt about any of this. I believed in my heart \r\nabout every possibility but you said no to me, Harley. You said no and I can't \r\nbelieve it, but here we are again. I mean, all those possibilities are right \r\nhere in front of me and all I have to do is say yes.",
        "Harley: Oh, Rick. Say yes.",
        "Rick: I'm just not sure I can do that.",
        "Reva: What are you're thinking.",
        "Josh: What am I thinking?",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nReva: This has nothing to do with the harbor project or anything that's \r\nhappening right now. It's about some things have been happening in my life \r\nlately. In fact, maybe you could help me explain them... Oh, I don't know.",
        "Josh: What things?",
        "Reva: Well, that's just it. I'm not sure I \r\nwant to say anything until I\u2019m absolutely positive.",
        "Josh: Then how am I going to help you explain \r\nthem?",
        "Reva: Well, you're not. Not yet.",
        "Josh: Reva, does this have something to do \r\nwith the painting, the one that Shayne thinks you're obsessed with?",
        "Reva: I'm not obsessed, not... Not exactly.",
        "Josh: Okay, okay. But when I went to see you \r\nthat day, I got the feeling you were keeping something from me. And I think this \r\nis about the painting. That's what this is about, right?",
        "Reva: What if I were to tell you...",
        "Alan: So much for my evening getting better. \r\nCouldn't you two star-crossed lovers find a more appropriate place for your \r\nlittle rendezvous?",
        "Josh: Was just leaving.",
        "Alan: That's what you said a half hour ago, \r\nJosh. But don't worry about it. Take your time. I'll be in the other room.",
        "Reva: No, Alan, wait. I do need to see you. \r\nDo you have a minute?",
        "Alan: I always have a minute for you, Reva. \r\nWhat is it about?",
        "Reva: Uh...",
        "Alan: Reva, what is it about?",
        "Reva: It's about this. There's some \r\ncoincidences in here that I... I would like to discuss with you.",
        "Alan: An American history book?",
        "Reva: Yes, particularly a chapter on the \r\nCivil War.",
        "Josh: Okay. All right, I think it's time for \r\nme to go. Excuse me.",
        "Alan: Say hello to Olivia. The Civil War? \r\nThat's going back a long way, isn't it, Reva?",
        "Reva: Well, it is. And it isn't.",
        "\r\n________________________________________",
        "\r\nHarley: So, you don't want to marry me?",
        "Rick: Didn't say that, did I?",
        "Harley: I thought this is what you wanted.",
        "Rick: It was... It was what I wanted, Harley. \r\n(Screaming)...Okay, you don't have to sell me on any of this.",
        "Harley: I'm not trying selling you on it. I'm \r\njust reminding you of all the stuff that you told me.",
        "Rick: I know, I remember everything I said to \r\nyou. The last time I saw you, Harley, we had a terrible, terrible fight. And \r\nwhen you left, I wasn't sure I was ever going to see you or my son again, so \r\nthis marriage proposal is just very confusing to me. I mean, can't you \r\nunderstand that? I mean, what do you expect me to say after all these months?",
        "Harley: I don't know. I guess I expected you \r\nto say how great our life together was going to be, how proud you are.",
        "Rick: Harley, I am so proud of you for making \r\nthat choice.",
        "Harley: Then... Then give me a good reason \r\nwhy you won't marry me. I mean, your divorce from Abby is final, right?",
        "Rick: Yes, it is.",
        "Harley: Well, our son is here. Rick, isn't \r\nJude everything you thought he would be?",
        "Rick: Harley, he's much more to me than that. \r\nI love that boy more than anybody I've ever loved in my entire life. It's not \r\nthat.",
        "Harley: Well, then what is it? Are you... Are \r\nyou still mad at me for leaving the way that I did?",
        "Rick: Harley, no.",
        "Harley: Is it Aitoro? Is it... Is it because \r\nhe delivered the baby and you were behind the bars?",
        "Rick: No, none of that matters anymore. It's \r\nnot that. It's...",
        "Harley: Okay, then there's something that \r\nyou're not telling me.",
        "Rick: Harley, things... Things have just \r\nchanged, that's all. (Baby crying) I'll... I'll go...",
        "Harley: No, I\u2019ll... I'll go.",
        "Rick: Things have just changed.",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nClayton: So, you're filling in for Rick at the hospital?",
        "Mel: Yep.",
        "Clayton: Wow.",
        "Mel: Only while he's out on paternity leave.",
        "Carol: Well, not every resident gets to fill \r\nin for the chief of emergency.",
        "Mel: Well, not every resident would say yes. \r\nIt's a tough job, dad.",
        "Clayton: Well, I think it's a real vote of \r\nconfidence. You should be jumping up and down right now. And with Rick as your \r\nmentor, you're well on your way, Mel.-",
        "Mel: I'm on my way, all right.",
        "Clayton: Well, you could at least look happy \r\nabout it.",
        "Mel: Look, dad, I don't think of Rick as just \r\nmy mentor. He's a friend and I'll miss him when he's away. Don't get me wrong. \r\nI'm glad the baby's here. I know how much it means to him, but...",
        "Clayton: But if you mess up, there won't be \r\nanybody there to make things right?",
        "Mel: Rick Bauer doesn't always make things \r\nright for me.",
        "Clayton: Hey, you're going to shine, I know \r\nyou are. And I'm happy for Rick, too. I think he's going to make a great dad.",
        "Mel: Wow. I didn't expect you to be so \r\nunderstanding.",
        "Clayton: About what?",
        "Mel: Rick having a baby out of wedlock.",
        "Clayton: You know, I accept things don't \r\nalways work out smoothly in life. I man, who knows? Maybe he'll wind up making a \r\nreal family with Harley.",
        "Mel: That's not going to happen.",
        "Clayton: Why not?",
        "Mel: Rick and Harley don't want to get \r\nmarried.",
        "Clayton: Did he ask her?",
        "Mel: Yes, and she said no.",
        "Clayton: Before or after she had the baby?",
        "Mel: What are you getting at?",
        "Clayton: Look, Rick gave me the same song he \r\ngave you. But when there's a baby around, it's a whole different ballgame.",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nAlan: Wow. What a strikingly handsome devil he is.",
        "Reva: (Laughs)",
        "Alan: I'll bet you noticed him right away.",
        "Reva: The resemblance is remarkable.",
        "Alan: General Mordecai Hudson, union army. \r\nOh, a Yankee--one of the good guys.",
        "Reva: Actually, they called him \"the beast of \r\nNew Orleans.\"",
        "Alan: I imagine they did.",
        "Reva: Why?",
        "Alan: Why what?",
        "Reva: Why do you imagine they called him \"the \r\nbeast?\"",
        "Alan: I've been called a lot worse, and it \r\nsays here that he's a conquering hero, captured New Orleans. (Laughs)",
        "Reva: Do you know whether you ware related to \r\nthis man?",
        "Alan: No. No, I don't know if I was related. \r\nI mean, we do have some relatives in New Orleans, but I haven't spoken with them \r\nI years.",
        "Reva: What about Alexandra? Do you think she \r\nmight know?",
        "Alan: Why? What's the point to all this, \r\nReva?",
        "Reva: Well, I... I wanted to produce a series \r\non genealogy.",
        "Alan: A television special of some sort?",
        "Reva: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I thought it would be \r\nfascinating to trace the roots of a family, you know, like the Spaulding\u2019s, \r\nSpringfield\u2019s own first family. I think the audience would be enthralled to find \r\nout as much as they could about... About people from your past. I mean, after \r\nall, you could very well be related to one of the most famous figures of the \r\nCivil War.",
        "Alan: I suggest you try another family. Why \r\ndon't you start with your own bunch of rubes? I do not want the Spaulding dirty \r\nlaundry strewn across the airwaves.",
        "Reva: It's not going to be a scandal piece \r\nand it's not like we're going to expose secrets.",
        "Alan: As you know, the Spaulding\u2019s have a \r\nvery dark past, and I am not anxious to have it revisited.",
        "Reva: Yes, but I just said...",
        "Alan: I know what you just said, and I don't \r\nwant you digging around in our past, present or our future.",
        "Reva: Okay, well, what if I give you the \r\nfinal edit? Hmm?",
        "Alan: No.",
        "Reva: You can see it before it airs.",
        "Alan: No. And I will not be voted off the \r\nisland and that is final.",
        "Reva: Okay.",
        "Alan: Okay, what? Okay, you won't, or okay, \r\nyou're going to do it anyway?",
        "Nolan: Excuse me, sir. I need your signature \r\non the card.",
        "Alan: Ah, thank you, Nolan. Thank you. No, \r\nReva, this is not for you. It's for a business associate of mine. We're \r\ncelebrating a successful closing.",
        "Reva: Gardenia?",
        "Alan: Yes. Perfume, wild gardenia. Nice \r\ntouch, don't you think?",
        "Reva: I actually have a friend who loves \r\ngardenias. Your associate must be someone very special.",
        "Alan: She is, indeed. Now, I have a meeting \r\nto attend to. Nolan, will you show Reva out, please?",
        "Nolan: Yes, sir.",
        "Reva: Guess I\u2019m being dismissed.",
        "Alan: You always caught on really fast.",
        "Reva: Must be an important meeting, huh?",
        "Alan: It is, and I'm five minutes late, so if \r\nyou'll excuse...",
        "Reva: Alan...",
        "Alan: What is it now?",
        "Reva: Nothing. Nothing, nothing, just... Good \r\nnight.",
        "Alan: Good night, Reva.",
        "Nolan: Ma'am?",
        "Reva: Do you think maybe I could use the \r\npowder room?",

        "\r\nCatalina: Sam, why did you tell Marah about Tony? There was no reason to do \r\nthat.",
        "Sam: She deserved to know the truth, \r\nCatalina. It's not fair. I can't go on lying to her anymore.",
        "Catalina: Yes, you could have because this \r\nwasn't just about your conscience, Sam! There were other people's lives \r\ninvolved. Tony and I were getting closer every day...",
        "Sam: Is that what this is about? Is that all \r\nyou care about, you and Tony? Huh?",
        "Catalina: No! No! All of us!",
        "Sam: You are just as selfish as my sister, \r\nyou know that? All that friendly advice about how to keep Marah safe and close \r\nto me. It wasn't for my sake. It was just so you could seal your deal with Tony. \r\nYou didn't give a damn about me. That's all you care about, yourself.",

        "Maria: That she'll take him away from you, \r\nhuh? Is that what you're concerned about? That's it, isn't it?",

Do you mind just splitting I just got \r\nto make a phone call. Hey, Phillip Spaulding, this is Gus Aitoro, private \r\ninvestigator. Let\u2019s... Let's meet. Breakfast, your treat.
