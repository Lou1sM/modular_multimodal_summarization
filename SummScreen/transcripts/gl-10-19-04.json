        "Harley/Ruth: Work.",
        "Gus: What's the matter? You still mad at me, because I grilled you the other day? You know, we had a security breech here at Spaulding and Phillip had me questioning everybody, not just you, okay.",
        "Harley/Ruth: Mr. Aitoro, you don't have to explain, sir. I'm a team player.",

        "Bill: Well, he's trying to be.",
        "Harley: Well, doe she know it's not real? Does he know you only married Olivia so that Phillip couldn't have her deported?",
        "Bill: Well, I haven't exactly filled him on everything. But I just want to keep as legit as possible, you know? Anyway are you heading over to Spaulding's?",
        "Harley: No, actually I'm already here. I'm looking through Phillip's papers to see if I could find anything that links with Phillip with Olivia's INS problems.",
        "Bill: All right. Well, just keep at it, okay. And don't get caught. I'll call you later.",

        "Harley/Ruth: Olivia Spencer.",
        "Phillip: Or is this about her facing deportation?",
        "Harley/Ruth: No, sir, it's a wedding announcement. She just married Bill Lewis.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: That was a nice kiss. I'm not so crazy about the wardrobe though, I have to tell you. I mean, jeans, Bill. Come on.",
        "Bill: We just got married and already nag, nag, nag.",
        "Olivia: No, no, it's just that this is our wedding celebration.",
        "Bill: Mm-hmm.",
        "Olivia: Your father went to a great deal of trouble to, you know, make this happen for us, and let bygones be bygones. I just want to acknowledge that. That's all. So what do you think of this? I bought this for the occasion. Would you wear it if you were a girl?",
        "Bill: (Laughs) well, I'll tell you this. I love you in just about anything. I think I love you in nothing. Tell you what. Why don't we put in a little time down here and then we'll head up to the honeymoon suite, focus on what's really important.",
        "Olivia: And what's that?",
        "Bill: What else? How to nail Phillip to the wall.",
        "Billy: My ex says I'm a teetotaler, but my son and his bride will probably want champagne. That's my new daughter-in-law right over there.",
        "Waiter: And I'm sure she'll appreciate all thought you put into it.",
        "Billy: Well, I hope you're right.",

        "Billy: Nothing but the best.",
        "Bill: Well, fine by me because I just married the best.",
        "Olivia: Oh, you are... you are sweet to me. You're sweet, too, because I was just telling Bill that I appreciate you doing all this for us. I thought that after I bought the building with your offices in it, there might be some hard feelings.",
        "Billy: Oh, heck no. No, I mean you married my son and now everything you have is his. So it's like it just stayed in the family.",

        "Josh: Reva, we need to talk. Hello? Excuse me. Sorry. Sandy Foster, the patient in this room. He's not there now. Was he taken some place for tests?",
        "Nurse: I don't know.",
        "Josh: Okay. Well, my wife was with him in there. She's not there either.",
        "Nurse: I wouldn't worry, Mr. Lewis. I'll check, but I'm sure Mr. Foster's just fine.",

        "Sandy: No. No.",
        "Reva: Sandy, you just had major surgery. You could barley sit up.",
        "Sandy: No. I won't let you face him...",
        "Reva: Don't.",
        "Sandy: ...Alone. Jonathan's bad, Reva. I'm a liar. I made you care. But he is bad.",
        "Reva: You certainly are convincing. I mean, first you... you pretend to be my son. And now you're trying to turn me against him. How do I know this isn't another set up? Why should I believe anything you say again?",
        "Sandy: I care about Tammy. I risked my life for her, didn't I?",

        "Reva: No. First you tell me everything you know, and I mean everything. What do you think Jonathan would do to my niece?",

        "Phillip: \"The lovers couldn't bare to be separated. They were wed in a cell in the Springfield City Jail.\" Oh. Jeffrey O'Neill performed the ceremony? (Laughs) this is better than the comics.",
        "Harley/Ruth: You're not angry, sir?",
        "Phillip: Angry? Ruth, no. No, I'm not angry. I'm delighted. Olivia's remarried. That means I don't have to pay her alimony anymore.",
        "Harley/Ruth: You don't think, sir, perhaps Ms. Spencer and Mr. Lewis are in love?",
        "Phillip: Well, with themselves certainly. With each other, hardly. No, they just got married so that Olivia doesn't have to leave the U.S. Oh, this is too good. This is too good. The question is, now what do I do with it? Ruth, I want you to put in a call to Olivia at the Beacon for me.",
        "Harley/Ruth: She's not at the Beacon, sir. She's at towers with Mr. Lewis and his father.",
        "Phillip: How do you know that?",
        "Harley/Ruth: Page five, sir. The social column.",
        "Phillip: Towers.",
        "Harley: Sir, where can I reach you should I need you, sir?",
        "Phillip: At the towers. I have to offer my condolences... my congratulations to the happy couple.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Olivia, I'm sure that you don't know Bill's sister.",
        "Olivia: Actually, that's not true. We've met. And I have a feeling we shop at the same stores.",
        "Bill: Man, I'll tell you what. It looks great. I mean with my sister, my partner, both with great taste that's all.",
        "Dinah: Partner?",
        "Bill: Yeah in life. A.K.A., my wife.",
        "Dinah: Oh. Okay. Well, I have to say this came as a surprise to me, you two getting married. But I'm delighted to see the two of you together. As long as you make my brother happy, Olivia. Otherwise there'll be hell to pay.",
        "Billy: Oh, and she means it, too. (Laughter)",
        "Dinah: Come on, let's get a drink so we can get better acquainted.",
        "Bill: Yeah, we'll join you.",
        "Olivia: No. You know what? It's okay. You guys go do your guy thing, and Dinah and I will do our girl thing.",
        "Billy: Sounds good to me.",
        "Olivia: Okay?",
        "Bill: All right. All right. All right.",
        "Billy: Bye. Look at those two. Kind of like peas in a pod, huh? Who knew they'd get along so well, huh?",
        "Olivia: Make it two. So, Dinah, I take it you don't approve?",
        "Dinah: Of your marriage? Who am I to judge?",
        "Olivia: True.",
        "Dinah: I've always wanted little Bill to settle down, and if you're the woman he's chosen, I think that's great. In fact, I have a little something for you. It's a congratulations-welcome to the family gift.",
        "Olivia: That's very nice of you. Thank you.",
        "Dinah: Open it.",
        "Olivia: That's absolutely beautiful.",
        "Dinah: It was my grandmother's. My grandpa Henry gave it to her on their wedding day. I hope you like it. It's a little old fashioned.",
        "Olivia: Like it. I love it. I really... wasn't expecting this.",
        "Dinah: You did something nice for me. When I was on the run and Bill told you he was hiding me, you kept our secret, and this is my way of thanking you.",
        "Olivia: I don't know what to say.",
        "Dinah: Say that you would honor, love, and cherish my brother and never ever hurt him. I would go to great lengths to protect someone I love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Sandy isn't my son.",
        "Josh: My God.",
        "Reva: I was so shocked. Sandy wasn't.",
        "Josh: Wait a minute. Are you telling me that he knew about this all along? That must be Sandy's laptop. Jeffrey was right. Jonathan's dead. Sandy may have been the one who killed him. Is there a problem?",
        "Nurse: I don't know how this happened.",
        "Josh: How what happened?",
        "Nurse: Your wife and Mr. Foster left the hospital.",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Nurse: I...",
        "Josh: How is that possible? He's been unconscious for days, connected to machines. He just bounced out of bed and took off someplace with... with my wife? Just walked out of the hospital? Hello, Chief Frank Cooper, please. This is Joshua Lewis calling. Yes, it's urgent. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Jonathan? Sleep with Tammy? No. His own cousin? He wouldn't. He'd never do that. Not my son.",
        "Sandy: You don't know him.",
        "Reva: I don't know you either. This whole thing is a nightmare. Why would he do this? Why Tammy?",
        "Sandy: He's hurting her... to hurt you.",
        "Reva: If this is another one of your lies, Sandy, I swear to God...",
        "Sandy: He stood... he stood over my bed and bragged about it. He thinks I'm too weak to stop him.",
        "Reva: Sick. He's sick.",
        "Sandy: Right. Go right to Towers.",
        "Reva: Towers.",
        "Sandy: Tammy wouldn't take him to... to the farm because of Cassie. But Edmund has a suite at the Towers.",
        "Reva: And Tammy has a key. This can't be happening.",
        "Sandy: Hurry up. We have to get there before Jonathan does.",
        "JB: You're beautiful. Perfect.",
        "Tammy: I don't want to be perfect.",
        "JB: Untouched.",
        "Tammy: Then touch me. Touch me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Oh, my God. Phillip? The whole town?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: I've got to tell you, when I saw Dinah walk in here, the same dress Olivia's got on, I thought there was going to be fireworks for sure. But look how well they're getting along, huh? Who knew?",
        "Billy: Yeah, who knew?",
        "Bill: Yeah. And I've got to thank you.",
        "Billy: For what?",
        "Bill: Well, for welcoming Olivia into the family. I mean, I really... I appreciate the effort, I really do. And don't you worry, all right? You're going to see that this marriage, smart move.",
        "Billy: Son, you make it sound like it's a business deal. Now, I really do want you to be happy.",
        "Bill: I know you do. I know. And I am, I am. I just... I'll be even happier once I've proved that Phillip's behind pulling the strings over at INS to deport Olivia.",
        "Phillip: Olivia.",
        "Olivia: Ugh.",
        "Phillip: I understand that you're a bride again. Congratulations. Hey, who knows? Maybe the fourth time will be the charm.",
        "Olivia: It's a private party.",
        "Phillip: And did I get this right, a jailhouse wedding? That's even more romantic than you strong-arming me into marrying you out at Ravenwood. Although I guess I was certifiable. What was your excuse, Bill?",
        "Bill: Well, Phillip, Olivia and I got married for the same reasons other people get married: We're in love. I think you're just a little sore that your little stunt to get her deported didn't work.",
        "Phillip: My stunt?",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Dinah: Phillip, don't you want to say hello to your charming cousin?",
        "Phillip: Of course I do. Hi, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: Hi.",
        "Phillip: How are you?",
        "Dinah: Surprisingly well.",
        "Phillip: Good. We've got a lot to catch up on.",
        "Dinah: More by the minute.",
        "Phillip: However, one thing I'd like to say first. Bill, about my so-called attempt to...",
        "Billy: Phillip, Phillip. Could I just talk to you for a minute over here, privately?",
        "Phillip: Happy to. What's up, Billy?",
        "Billy: You know you don't belong here.",
        "Phillip: So Bill hasn't figured it out yet, huh?",
        "Billy: Figured out what?",
        "Phillip: That you were the one that tried to get rid of Olivia. But your plan backfired. He married her. (Laughs) and now you're stuck with her. (Laughs) life is so deliciously filled with irony sometimes, isn't it?",
        "Olivia: He really knows how to ruin a party, doesn't he?",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, I'll tell you something. I'm glad he's here. It means we're getting to him. That beats champagne and wedding gifts, right? (Cell phone rings) hold on a second. Excuse me, all right?",
        "Olivia: Yeah.",
        "Bill: What's up?",
        "Harley: Plenty. Phillip had a scale model made of Springfield. No, no, no, no, no--the new and improved Springfield, according to his plan. And everything has his name on it. There's the Spaulding Civic Center, and there's the Spaulding Stadium, and there's the Spaulding Space Needle. Well, I'm kidding about the Space Needle, but you have got to get down here and bring a camera. We have to document this. We can give it to the press. We can show them what Phillip is capable of if we don't stop him.",
        "Bill: Well, you know Phillip. He's going to put his own spin on it. Listen, he's going to say \"it's good for the economy, blah, blah, blah.\" But listen, how are we coming on the Olivia front?",
        "Harley: I've looked every place I can think of. Unless...",
        "Bill: Unless what? You find something?",
        "Harley: Maybe. Listen, just get down here with the camera.",
        "Bill: I'll be right there. All right. Hey, I'm sorry. I've got to go. That's Harley. I've got to help her with something.",
        "Olivia: Right now you have to go?",
        "Bill: Yeah, it's something that will help us get some information on Phillip, all right? And that's why we got married, right? To really nail this guy. Okay?",
        "Olivia: Yeah.",
        "Bill: So I won't be long, all right?",
        "Olivia: Okay.",
        "Dinah: Trouble in paradise already? (Shredder running)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: (Squeals in surprise)",
        "Gus: Hey, Ruth? I left the file... Ruth? Why is this door locked? (Knocking at door) Ruth, what's going on in there? Open this door. (Rattling door)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: I just tried the house. Reva's not there. She's not answering her cell phone, either.",
        "Frank: All right, Josh, take it easy. With everything that Sandy's been through lately, there's absolutely no way he could be a physical threat to anyone, especially his own mother.",
        "Josh: She's not his mother, Frank.",
        "Frank: Say what?",
        "Josh: Sandy has been pretending to be Jonathan. The real Jonathan Randall disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Some kind of a mountain climbing accident in Switzerland, and Sandy may have been involved in some way.",
        "Frank: Are you saying that you think Sandy could have killed Jonathan? I mean, do you have any proof of this?",
        "Josh: Jeffrey O'Neill believes it to the point that he started an investigation. (Cell phone rings)",
        "Frank: Cooper here. Really? All right. Thank you very much. Patrol car said that they just spotted Reva's car up in the towers parking lot.",
        "Josh: The towers? Great. Nice and high. Let's go.",
        "Housekeeper: I'm not supposed to do this. If anyone finds out, I...",
        "Reva: Nobody's going to find out. Just open the door, please. Thank you. If this is another one of your lies, I swear...",
        "Sandy: You want me to go first?",
        "Reva: No. I'll go. Tammy?",
        "Tammy: What are you doing here?",
        "Sandy: Where is he?",
        "Tammy: Sandy, when did you get out of the hospital?",
        "Sandy: Where is he?",
        "Tammy: Where is who?",
        "Reva: You know who, Tammy. Is he in there?",
        "Tammy: No, Aunt Reva, you can't go in there.",
        "Reva: Yes, I can.",
        "Tammy: You thought JB was in there, didn't you?",
        "Reva: JB?",
        "Tammy: I cannot believe you invaded my privacy like this.",
        "Reva: Honey, tell me where he is. Where did he go?",
        "Tammy: That is none of your business.",
        "Reva: Oh, no, it's very much my business. You know nothing about him. You don't know who he is.",
        "Tammy: And you do?",
        "Reva: I know he's trouble.",
        "Tammy: So? Trouble can be fun.",
        "Reva: Trouble is dangerous.",
        "Tammy: Honestly, Aunt Reva, when did you become such a prude?",
        "Reva: I cannot explain this to you right now, okay? Just stay away from him! I know you think you like him, but you don't know him, okay? So just stay away from him.",
        "Tammy: Too late.",
        "Reva: What does that mean, too late?",
        "Tammy: I'm 18, Aunt Reva. I can do what I want, with whoever I want.",
        "Reva: Please, Tammy, tell me you didn't sleep with him.",
        "Tammy: Why? Ashamed. I like JB and he likes me. He likes me a lot. There's nothing wrong with it.",
        "Sandy: Tammy, he didn't.",
        "Tammy: Would both of you just lighten up? What is the big deal? Look, Aunt Reva, I appreciate your being all protective of me and I'm grateful to you for saving my life, but it is my life, okay? JB and I care about each other, and tonight was amazing. It was perfect. Just the way I always dreamed my first time would be. And I'm not going to apologize to you or anybody else. You two are going to have to finish this on your own because I need to go find JB.",
        "Reva: No, Tammy.",
        "Sandy: Tammy.",
        "Reva: Tammy, no, stop! Sandy. Sandy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: It's sweet, the way you look after your brother, especially after you've been out of his life for so many years. But the fact is, we're fine, Bill and I. He just had some business to attend to.",
        "Dinah: Most men wouldn't think about business on their honeymoon.",
        "Olivia: Bill isn't most men.",
        "Dinah: No, he's not. He's very special, very precious to me.",
        "Olivia: That's something else we have in common.",
        "Dinah: I really hope so.",
        "Billy: So, Phillip... (laughs) you think that I had Olivia deported. Is that what you think? That sounds much more like you, not me.",
        "Phillip: And that's what you wanted everybody to think. You know, Billy, I have friends in high places, too, and as soon as I heard that Olivia might be deported, I thought, you know, who--other than me--would want to see that happen? So, I called a friend at INS, and he fingered you. I have the whole conversation on tape, if you'd like to hear it. I wonder how Bill would like to get that for a wedding present?",
        "Billy: What is it you want?",

        "Billy: Here? No. Why?",
        "Josh: Well, her car is in the parking lot... what's going on?",
        "Billy: I'm throwing a little party for Bill and Olivia. They just got married.",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Billy: Yes. They did.",
        "Olivia: Maybe Bill invited Reva and just forgot to tell you?",
        "Josh: Has anybody actually seen Reva here?",
        "Phillip: What's going on, Frank?",
        "Frank: I can't go into it right now, but we are looking for Reva.",
        "Josh: You know, maybe we should just go talk to the maitre d'.",
        "Frank: That's a good idea.",
        "Josh: Thanks anyway.",
        "Billy: Keep me posted.",
        "Josh: Yeah, absolutely.",
        "Dinah: Something tells me you're not going to be getting a china setting from Bill's Uncle Josh.",
        "Phillip: Josh seemed a bit harried. I didn't even know Reva was out of the hospital.",
        "Billy: Why should you care?",
        "Phillip: Well, Reva and Sandy are both my employees. I've been concerned about them since the accident.",
        "Billy: Wait, wait, wait a minute. What is it... Phillip, you're all of a sudden jittery. Hey, what's going on here? I thought I was the only one with something to hide.",

        "Ruth: What if I am, sir? What's it to you?",
        "Gus: What are you shredding, Ruth? What are you shredding?",
        "Ruth: Mind your own business, sir.",
        "Gus: No, I can't do that, Ruth. Oh, this is no good. Listen, obviously Phillip Spaulding has convinced you to do something for him, right? Well, listen to me. I'm telling you, he's leading you down the wrong path. Ruth, he does not... he does not deserve your loyalty, do you hear me? Ruth?",
        "Ruth: You do, sir?",

        "Gus: No, I heard that, Ruth, and no. So, this is what's going to happen. Either you're going to open the door right now or I'm going to kick it in!",

        "Phillip: Well, hey, believe it or not, I really hope this marriage thing works out for you.",

        "Phillip: True love? Okay, if that's the line that you and Bill are going with for public consumption, that's fine. But listen, just between the two of us, marrying him was a very smart move. I'm impressed.",
        "Olivia: It's a real marriage in every sense of the word.",
        "Phillip: You love him, and he loves you.",
        "Olivia: Yes.",
        "Phillip: Okay. Then don't blow it. Be a good wife, be a good mother to Emma. Throw bake sales, raise money for charity, do whatever your heart desires. Just don't cross me.",
        "Olivia: You know the wonderful truly blissful thing about being divorced from you? I don't have to listen to a word you say. I have the man that I love, my daughter and my green card, and I am finally, finally free of you.",

        "Reva: No. No, I thought that, too, but he's helping me, Joshua. He came clean on everything and we came here to try to save Tammy, but we were too late.",
        "Josh: Where is Tammy. Reva, come on. Just talk to me, okay? Tell me what happened here.",
