Tony sneaks on the boat to protect Michele and is almost shot by Sebastian. Sebastian talks to himself and says there has been a change in plans. At the Beacon, Blake and Ross argue because Ross had her arrested to keep her from going on the trip with Sebastian. Ross thinks Sebastian is just as dangerous as Roger and wants to investigate his past. Blake gets even more angry at this suggestion and decides to stay and have a drink rather then go home with Ross. Blake makes Danny think Michelle has left town with Tony unaware that he is actually with her. Danny calls Michelle's cell phone and Tony answers the call. Danny hangs up the phone when he hears Michelle's voice in the background. At the Mansion, Bill discovers Philip's wrecked car hidden on Spaulding property. Harley confirms its Philips car when she finds something with his initials on the front seat. Harley takes tire tracks and pictures of the car to determine point of impact. Harley is later told by the lab that the tire tracks match those of the car that hit Sandy. Harley smiles because she thinks she is going to send Philip to jail for causing Sandy's accident."

        "Lizzie: Daddy, the accident is on the front page of the newspaper.",
        "Phillip: Honey, don't pay attention that. I told you there's nothing to worry about. The car is gone, okay.",
        "Lizzie: Daddy, I can't help it. Sandy's still in the hospital. It's awful.",
        "Phillip: Listen to me. You need something to take your mind off all of the terrible things that have happened lately.",
        "Lizzie: I don't know if I can do that.",
        "Phillip: Well, guess what? Your old dad had an idea a couple of days and I just went ahead with it. So I'm going to cheer you up. Lewis? Would you bring Ms. Elizabeth's gift?",
        "Lizzie: Daddy!",
        "Phillip: (Laughs)",
        "Lizzie: Hi.",
        "Phillip: Look. I knew this isn't the place to give it to you, but she couldn't wait to meet you.",
        "Lizzie: Hello. How...",
        "Phillip: Here, here. Take her out and say hi.",
        "Lizzie: She's mine?",
        "Phillip: She's yours. Of course she's yours.",
        "Lizzie: Come here, baby. (Sighs) she's perfect. Come here. Let me see you.",
        "Phillip: I knew she'd cheer you up.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, you're so beautiful. Hi. Hi. (Phone rings",
        "Phillip: Hold on a second, please. Oh, honey I have to take this. Be just a second. (Lizzie's phone ring)",
        "Lizzie: I'm sorry. I got to get it. Oh, I really don't need this now.",
        "Coop: Where are you?",
        "Lizzie: Better question. Why are you calling me?",
        "Coop: Come to J. Farley's and find out.",
        "Lizzie: Farley's? I... I can't. I don't go to bars.",
        "Coop: Sure. Whatever. Look, I'll see you in a few, okay.",
        "Lizzie: Wait. No, no, no. Can you tell me what it is?",
        "Coop: Like you don't know.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, right. I guess I'll be right there. Oh, gosh, he knows. He knows that I'm the person who hit Sandy. And you're coming with me, pup. You could be my guard dog. Okay?",
        "Phillip: Lizzie? Lizzie? Lizzie?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: You think she's coming?",
        "Coop: We'll see.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: Cheap trick, Ross. Locking me in a jail cell. Talk about abusing your power, Mr. Mayor.",
        "Ross: Blake, I'll do the same thing again in a second.",
        "Blake: I'm your wife, not your prisoner.",
        "Ross: I know that. And I'm not going to have my wife getting on a plane with a perfect stranger who wants to take her who knows where.",
        "Blake: The perfect stranger happens to be my brother. And you betcha I'm going to get on that plane.",
        "Ross: Too late. That plane's left. Sebastian's gone.",
        "Blake: We'll see about that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: Something about the stars when you're out on the water.",
        "Michelle: You know I'm glad we're making this trip together.",
        "Holly: Me too. We went on a trip once long time ago.",
        "Michelle: Yeah.",
        "Holly: Turned into quite an adventure. Oh, but you don't remember that.",
        "Michelle: No, I don't. But you could fill me in. Because you know I'll take any adventure I could get.",
        "Holly: (Laughs) I've had enough adventures to last two lifetimes. I just want to make some closure in my life... the part with Roger. And I'm hoping that this journey will help me do that.",
        "Michelle: So what's Blake story? I thought she was interested in finding her father's legacy? How come she didn't show?",
        "Holly: I wish I knew.",
        "Sebastian: I'm sorry, Chrissy, we've already left.",
        "Blake: Sebastian, this is suppose to be you and me. We're suppose to be sharing this trip. It's about our father.",
        "Sebastian: I know. I know. I wish you were here, too. But maybe this is a blessing in disguise.",
        "Blake: Thanks.",
        "Sebastian: What I'm saying is maybe you could do a little damage control. Keep people off the track if they start asking about Michelle and Holly. Promise me, Chrissy.",
        "Blake: All right, I promise. I'll protect you. Thank you I'll be about touch.",

        "Harley: Are you all right? Wait. Wait for me.",
        "Bill: Shhh.",
        "Harley: See, this is my least favorite part of the Spaulding property. I'm always afraid a little hand is going to come out of the mud and grab my ankle.",
        "Bill: Hey, stop it. Shh.",
        "Harley: Wait. Wait. Help me. What are we doing out here?",
        "Bill: Well, ironically, digging up skeletons. Only this one is not buried very well. Take a look at this.",
        "Harley: You brought me all the way out here to look at a junked car?",
        "Bill: Harley, take a closer look. Not just any junked car.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Ruth, open this door. All right, your time is up.",
        "Harley: Oh, yeah, that's a car. Look, I've got to get back. Gus is going to break into the study any second.",
        "Bill: Harley, Harley...",
        "Harley: And I've got to get my wig.",
        "Bill: Harley, forget about Gus. Forget about Gus. Don't you know whose car this is?",
        "Harley: No, no. I'm sure at one time it was a very nice car, however. But no.",
        "Bill: Look, I've seen Phillip driving this car. If you look close enough there's a dent here and I swear to you there's blood. Right there. Now, where are we? We're on Spaulding property. Why would someone want to dump a car like this? Maybe they have something else to hide. What does that tell you?",
        "Harley: That tells me we might be looking at the fall of the house of Spaulding.",
        "Harley: Help me with this. See if you can open this door.",
        "Bill: It's jammed.",
        "Harley: Give me the napkin.",
        "Bill: What are you looking for?",
        "Harley: Well, he always leaves his own personal brand on everything he owns. You know, big ego. No, I need it. Don't let me fall in. I see it. There it is: P.G.S. Yeah. P.G.S. This is Phillip's car.",
        "Bill: All right, we got him.",
        "Harley: This is Phillip's car.",
        "Bill: We got him.",
        "Harley: I can't believe it. Why would he do that? A hit and run? A hit and run? He would just leave Sandy to die like that?",
        "Bill: Harley, Harley, this was not an accident. This was not an accident. Maybe he saw his chance to do some real damage to my family and he just couldn't resist.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Philip's assistant Ruth is on the grounds someplace, could you find her and bring her to me, please, and, be careful. She's a weirdo.",
        "Phillip: Cues me, these are the background checks you asked for. Terrific, anybody I should be concerned with? There is one employee I'm not too sure about. Something is not right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: What a surprise, Ruth. (Sirens) no, no, no, no. Ssh. Are they looking for you?",
        "Harley: I can't believe this. I don't know. It could be. Gus must have gotten into the study. Look, I've got to get my backup wig and get back there before they send out the dogs.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: You can run, Ms. Karloff, but you can't hide.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Lizzie. Over here.",
        "Lizzie: Oh. Hi, Buzz. I didn't know you were here.",
        "Buzz: I know what happened.",
        "Lizzie: You do?",
        "Coop: Lizzie, we just have to get a couple of things straight, that's all.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, like what?",
        "Coop: I know what happened wasn't an accident.",
        "Lizzie: No, really, it was an accident.",
        "Buzz: We all know what happened.",
        "Lizzie: Everybody? I mean, who all knows?",
        "Coop: Your dad. My brother, Frank.",
        "Lizzie: Frank? The chief of police?",
        "Coop: Yeah. You were standing there. You saw him, didn't you?",
        "Lizzie: I didn't see anyone.",
        "Buzz: Coop, you told me she was right there when you drove the bulldozer through the gate to the Spaulding place.",
        "Coop: She was there. She was standing right there.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, the bulldozer. I... yeah, you're right. I didn't know you were talking about that.",
        "Coop: What else would we be talking about right now?",
        "Lizzie: I thought...",
        "Buzz: What did you think we were talking about?",
        "Phillip: Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Daddy.",
        "Phillip: Hi. Honey, we didn't finish our conversation. Come on. I don't think you belong here, sweetheart. Come on.",
        "Lizzie: But Coop called me and he wanted me to come over here and it sounded important, so...",
        "Phillip: Okay. What is this about?",
        "Coop: And then she started freaking out.",
        "Phillip: Buzz, what is this about?",
        "Buzz: I was about to ask you the same question.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: I've got a question for you: Ross has gone to some extreme measures in order to keep me safe--or as I call it, imprisoned--and I know that you've gone to the same measures for Michelle over the years, and how has it worked out for you? Yeah. That's what I thought.",
        "Ross: Danny, I apologize for Blake getting you involved in this.",
        "Blake: Ross, you want to know what happens when you try to control a woman and put her in a cage? She comes out fighting. Or she simply walks away.",
        "Danny: Oh, she's right about that, Ross. Take it from someone who knows.",
        "Blake: See?",
        "Ross: Okay, I... can we agree to disagree long enough to have a little dinner and talk?",
        "Blake: I haven't heard you say you're sorry for locking me up.",
        "Ross: Blake, I am sorry. I'm sorry that I didn't lock you up the second I met Sebastian.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: Have you heard anything from Blake?",
        "Sebastian: No. Not a word.",
        "Holly: Neither have I. It's very strange.",
        "Sebastian: I wish she could have been here.",
        "Holly: Me, too. Roger meant so much to her. She loved him, more than he deserved.",
        "Sebastian: Holly, he adored Chrissy. It broke his heart that he couldn't be more of a father to her. I'm sorry that Chrissy's not here, but I am glad that you are. And I promise you that this is going to be a trip that you will always remember.",
        "Holly: Let's hope all the memories are pleasant ones.",
        "Tony: Ssh.",
        "Michelle: What are you doing here?",
        "Tony: I'm saving your butt, Michelle. Somebody has to. Now be quiet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: All right, Lizzie. Let's go. Come on.",
        "Lizzie: No. Daddy...",
        "Buzz: My son asked your daughter to meet him here so he could apologize for what happened yesterday, for scaring her when he drove the bulldozer through your gates.",
        "Phillip: Oh. Okay. And did he?",
        "Coop: I was getting to it, until she started acting all weird on me.",
        "Buzz: It's the truth.",
        "Phillip: And what, Buzz? You thought... you thought that a heartfelt apology would be enough to get your son off the hook? Don't you think he owes us a bit more than that?",
        "Coop: Owes? You want to talk about owing, you owe us. You're the one that turned my sister's house into rubble. You're the one that put my father in the hospital with a heart attack.",
        "Buzz: Coop.",
        "Phillip: Lizzie, why don't you wait in the car while I settle this?",
        "Lizzie: No. You know what? I'm the injured party here and I want to stay.",
        "Coop: Injured party?",
        "Phillip: Actually, you know what? This is a fortuitous meeting. You've saved me postage. This is the bill for damages.",
        "Coop: No problem. I've already agreed to work it off.",
        "Phillip: And so you shall. As a matter of fact, I think I've come up with the perfect job for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: (Grunts)",
        "Gus: Did you have a nice little walk, Ms. Karloff?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: I don't need to be saved.",
        "Tony: Michelle? Yeah, you do. Okay, you have no idea what this Sebastian guy is up to, all right?",
        "Michelle: Oh, yeah. And you have insider information now?",
        "Tony: Will you listen to me? Hey, I heard him on the phone with Blake just now.",
        "Michelle: Blake? Why isn't she here?",
        "Tony: All I heard him say was that she cannot mention where they're going or where we're headed, all right? Now I'm telling you, he's taking you and Holly, he's taking you guys somewhere, you're going to have no idea where you are. Nobody is.",
        "Michelle: That is okay by me.",
        "Tony: It's not by me. I am getting you out of here right now.",
        "Michelle: Are you high? We're in the middle of the ocean.",
        "Tony: I don't care. Go. Go, go, go, go.",
        "Michelle: Get away.",
        "Holly: Did you find your camera?",
        "Michelle: Oh, you know what? I think I left it in my room.",
        "Sebastian: I'll send someone down for it.",
        "Michelle: No, it's okay. I'll get it myself.",
        "Sebastian: No, no, Michelle. That's the long way. This way is much shorter.",
        "Michelle: You know, I don't even think I need my camera, really, because it looks like it's probably too dark to shoot anything anyway.",
        "Sebastian: Oh, I don't know. I think it's a perfect time to shoot. If you have the right subject.",
        "Holly: Sebastian, just put the gun away. This is some kind of a mistake.",
        "Sebastian: If these women hadn't been here, I would have shot you on sight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: I think the punishment should fit the crime.",
        "Coop: Whatever it is, I can take it.",
        "Phillip: Well, he is your son, isn't he?",
        "Buzz: Oh, cut to the chase!",
        "Phillip: Starting right now, you are my daughter's chauffeur.",
        "Coop and Lizzie: What?",
        "Phillip: You will be at her beck and call 24 hours a day.",
        "Lizzie: Daddy, no!",
        "Phillip: I'm not finished, sweetheart. You will wear the requisite uniform at all times, the cost of which will be deducted from your salary, but you will be justly compensated at minimum wage, which means that, oh, I guess around the time you're in your mid-30s, you should have everything paid off. Do we have a deal?",
        "Coop: Jail time is starting to look a little bit better than this.",
        "Lizzie: Daddy, I don't want this.",
        "Phillip: Lizzie, please. What'll it be? Driving Miss Lizzie or new kid on the block at Vailsburg State Penitentiary.",
        "Buzz: Forget it. I'll cover the damages.",
        "Phillip: How are you going to do that, Buzz? You got a money tree growing out back of company?",
        "Buzz: No money tree. Just the restaurant.",
        "Coop: Dad, no.",
        "Buzz: This should cover the damages. What do you say? You wanted it before.",
        "Lizzie: Take it, Dad.",
        "Phillip: All that time you spent fighting to save company and you'd turn it over to me, just like that.",
        "Buzz: For my son? You bet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Yes, you can call the search off for Ms. Karloff. She's present and accounted for.",
        "Ruth: Well then, sir, I'll be heading home. I'm not feeling too well.",
        "Gus: No. No, no, no, no, no. No. You wouldn't want to track that mud all through the house now, would you?",
        "Ruth: No. Of course not, sir. No. Yes, I apologize. There's just been so much rain lately, sir. The grounds are like a swamp.",
        "Gus: Yeah, tell me something, Ruth. May I call you Ruth? Of course, sir. Why you would feel necessary to lock this door and exit through the window?",
        "Ruth: Well, sir, I needed air, claustrophobia, sir.",
        "Gus: You never mentioned anything like that on the medical report that you filled out.",
        "Ruth: Sir, I never filled out a medical report.",
        "Gus: No you didn't. That's good. You're sharp. Close attention to detail. I like that. Which is why it's so surprising to me, it's ??? so...",
        "Ruth: What is, sir?",
        "Gus: On your application it has so much typos.",
        "Ruth: I'll take this home and retype it for you sir and have it in the morning.",
        "Gus: No actually like your address here. 244 Lake Avenue, is that your address?",
        "Ruth: Yes.",
        "Gus: Well, I researched your address and that's the lake, all right.",
        "Ruth: Yes, sir, on the lake, yes.",
        "Gus: No, not on the lake, in the lake like you would need a snorkel to have a sandwich.",
        "Ruth: Why are you giving me the third degree?",
        "Gus: Well, Ruth, we're just trying to keep our records updated. Do you have a problem with that?",
        "Ruth: No.",
        "Gus: Good. Do you have a problem with me following up on your references?",
        "Ruth: My references, sir, are impeccable. Now, if you're quite done with this inquisition, I'll take my leave.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Is it raining?",
        "Bill: Hell of a way to spend my wedding night.",
        "Danny: Oh, you're married. Really? To who?",
        "Bill: Olivia.",
        "Danny: Are you joking? You're joking, right?",
        "Bill: It's the real deal. She's up in the honeymoon suite now.",
        "Danny: But you're down here?",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, long story.",
        "Danny: Okay. Okay. Well, good luck. You'll need it.",
        "Bill: You know, no need for the anti-Olivia cracks, okay? Just...",
        "Danny: I'm not anti-Olivia. I'm not. I'm anti-marriage.",
        "Bill: Anti... whoa, wait a minute, now. Don't tell me Michelle wised up and finally gave you your walking papers. I'll take that as a yes. (Cell phone rings) baby, just give me a few more minutes. I'm just cleaning up a few details here and we'll get ready with a honeymoon love session.",
        "Harley: Stop, stop, stop. Too much information.",
        "Bill: Harley, hey, what's up? Sorry.",
        "Harley: Code red, red alert. Gus is about to check Ruth's references.",
        "Bill: Right now?",
        "Harley: Yes, right now. Are you ready?",
        "Bill: Well, you know, I know we were supposed to be ready for this but now is not the best time.",
        "Harley: Meet me at towers in 15 minutes. 15 minutes.",
        "Bill: Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What about... ...my honeymoon?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: Why is it so important to you to spend time with Sebastian, anyway? You didn't even know you had a half-brother until a few weeks ago.",
        "Blake: Ross, he's my only connection to my father. I know you can't possibly understand.",
        "Ross: Blake, all his life, your father was a dangerous man, and if my instincts are right, so is Sebastian.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: Tony Santos. I don't recall your name on the guest list.",
        "Michelle: I invited him.",
        "Sebastian: To hide out on my yacht?",
        "Michelle: No. No, but once he got on board, I realized that I shouldn't have asked him without checking with you first.",
        "Holly: Sebastian, just put the gun away. This is some kind of a mistake.",
        "Michelle: I'm really sorry. I know I should have asked you.",
        "Sebastian: If these women hadn't been here, I would have shot you on sight for trespassing.",
        "Tony: Go ahead, man.",
        "Sebastian: You are cocky.",
        "Tony: Yeah.",
        "Sebastian: Careless and stupid. But since you're a friend of Maureen's daughter, I owe you an apology for overreacting. This trip is very important to me and I'm very emotional.",
        "Holly: Please just put it away. Do me a favor?",
        "Sebastian: Of course.",
        "Tony: Yeah, you're right, Michelle. So much for no danger, huh?",
        "Michelle: You're the one who needed protecting, not me. You know, I am so sick of you and Danny treating me like I'm some sort of a bimbo...",
        "Tony: Michelle. Michelle, stop it! I'm telling you, I'm tired of you comparing me to Danny.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: Blake, if you're so sure that Sebastian has nothing to hide, what's wrong with having him investigated?",
        "Blake: Investigate that daughter of yours first and then we'll talk about my brother.",
        "Ross: This is not about Dinah. You know, I'm pretty much losing my appetite.",
