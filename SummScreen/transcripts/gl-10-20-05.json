        "Harley: I need it all. Okay? The cash flow statement, the balance sheet just give me everything you got. What? I can see why.",
        "Harley: A hostile take over bid. They have to convince the-- the board that it wouldn't be a good idea that we shouldn't just dump these guys. I got the world on my shoulders here, can't you see?",
        "Gus: You back to running the world.",
        "Harley: What do you got? No, wait. Wait. I said I wasn't going to let this change me and I don't want it to so forget about this. How are you? You were still sleeping this morning.",
        "Gus: Yes, I was. A little bit better just kiss my wife, but -- I got muffin in my mouth.",
        "Harley: Better?",
        "Gus: Much better. You go back to running the world now, I'll be fine. I thought I told you I'd meet you at the station, didn't I say that?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, that's right. I can see that you're busy.",
        "Gus: That guy's like a puppy dog. Get away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: And I thought getting shot was the worst thing that can happen on this job.",
        "Dinah: You let him go. You're a complete idiot. Why would you let Edmund go back on the street?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Honey, there are people on the board who like you, I'm convinced of that.",
        "Harley: Well, not enough of them.",
        "Gus: You can turn that around, can't you?",
        "Harley: Yeah, but how am I going to do that? I mean, hey, it's not like, you know, I've ever run away from a fight in my life before, but I can't do this alone. I just wish there was one person, one stupid person in that company that I knew I could trust.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Frank, it will just take a minute. You'll never even know that I was here. Please let me see Alan.",
        "Frank: They said it wouldn't last.",
        "Beth: Frank.",
        "Frank: All right, Beth, you got two minutes.",
        "Beth: Thank you.",
        "Alan: Good morning, Beth.",
        "Beth: How did you know it was me?",
        "Alan: Well, I could smell your perfume. My, my, that's a gorgeous outfit you look fabulous.",
        "Beth: Thank you. But I'm afraid there isn't much good about this morning, have you seen the paper?",
        "Alan: No.",
        "Beth: Harley is running Spaulding into the ground. First the pharmaceutical division then what? We're going to lose this company, piece by piece.",
        "Alan: Yes. And isn't it wonderful?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Officer: I'm going to get the paperwork started.",
        "Marina: I'll stay with him.",
        "Danny: Marina...",
        "Marina: Danny...",
        "Danny: You got to help me. Someone obviously set me up to break into that hotel room. You were with me when I got that phone call.",
        "Marina: Who set you up?",
        "Danny: I don't know. O'Neill, maybe.",
        "Marina: The D.A.?",
        "Danny: He lied to you about the baby's D.N.A. test so he could stay with Cassie. He doesn't care that that baby is mine or Michelle's. I've got to find Michelle to tell her that her baby is alive. You've got to help me get out of here.",
        "Marina: I know, I will. I don't know how yet.",
        "Frank: You know what? I don't think anybody's going to be going anywhere.",
        "Danny: Frank, come on, you don't understand. I've got to find Michelle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Why are you holding on so tight, Michelle, why? You never even saw her face. Never saw anything. It was just months of feeling and then nothing. So sorry that I lost you. But I have another child that needs my love and my attention and I have to let you go.",
        "Edmund: Michelle. What a pleasant surprise. You up here all alone?",
        "Edmund: Arrived just in time. I think it's about to pour. Sorry, Michelle, I didn't think anyone was going to be here.",
        "Michelle: What are you doing here Edmund?",
        "Edmund: Well it's a funny story, really. I ran into Rick I asked him if he knew of place I could stay outside of town even just for a night and he recommended the famous Bauer cabin.",
        "Michelle: And Rick told you, you could use it just like that?",
        "Edmund: No. Michelle, no. I've been having some problems lately. Prescription pill problems after a back injury I just couldn't-- you know the story. Rick's been advising me.",
        "Michelle: What do you mean you came up here to dry out?",
        "Edmund: Cold turkey. I'm confused though, you're here, I thought you would be in California.",
        "Michelle: I'm just here for a couple of days. I really didn't want anyone to know that I was here.",
        "Edmund: And here I am. That will explain why you're so-- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're sorting through all this stuff in your life, it's hard, it's confusing. Me, I don't... ( Laughs ) I don't know how to even take one step towards a future without Cassie. Probably because I never thought I'd have a future without Cassie.",
        "Michelle: Look, you have a child to think about now. So that's a good thing.",
        "Edmund: Yes. Yes, it is.",
        "Michelle: You lost the love of your life. But because you guys share a child together you know, he'll never be that far away.",
        "Edmund: She. She, Michelle, she will never be that far away.",
        "Michelle: Right. Sorry. Just projecting, I guess. Would you mind getting that for me? ( Teakettle whistling )",
        "Edmund: Sure.",
        "Michelle: Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Frank, will you just let me go so that I can find Michelle?",
        "Frank: Let you go? You broke into a woman's room and assaulted a security guard.",
        "Marina: He was trying to...",
        "Frank: Do you think for two seconds I would let you go out there look for your ex-wife while you're dating my daughter? I don't think so. And you, get over here. Marina, what the hell are you thinking? What are you doing?",
        "Marina: Dad.",
        "Frank: Enough! I did not raise my daughter this way.",
        "Marina: This is exactly how I was raised. To fight a good fight, to believe what I believe in that's exactly what I'm doing. I don't care if you don't believe in it.",
        "Frank: Do you really care about this guy that much? Oh, my, God.",
        "Marina: You have to go let him find Michelle, okay? It's the right thing. And it's the only way he'll have chance to love me.",
        "Frank: Marina, if it hasn't happened already... ( Phone ringing )",
        "Danny: That could be Michelle. Please, will you let me answer it?",
        "Frank: Excuse me, this man is a suspect. You are on duty you're also on probation. Do not answer that phone.",
        "Marina: Look...",
        "Frank: Marina!",
        "Marina: Hello? Hello? Hello?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: When will that Santos boy ever get that guy together.",
        "Beth: Danny Santos is not the issue; Harley is the issue. Now I tell you she's about to lose the pharmaceutical division and you say more power to her?",
        "Alan: Yes.",
        "Beth: You really are crazy. Speaking of which, why did you have me post Edmund's bail?",
        "Alan: Because he and I have something in common, you.",
        "Beth: Oh, please.",
        "Alan: Beth, it's just an investment for the future, that's all. Whenever I need to call in a favor, he will answer me.",
        "Beth: Okay. Sounds like fun. Now back to Harley.",
        "Alan: How is this for a headline: \"New C.E.O. Of Spaulding Enterprises loses pharmaceutical division.\" She will never recover.",
        "Beth: Alan, I want Harley to fail, too, but not at the expense of the company.",
        "Alan: Well, sometimes to save the body you have to cut off a limb. Besides, it's already in motion.",
        "Beth: I see. And am I involved?",
        "Alan: Intimately. You see, I've had some files cooked at the office to show that the pharmaceutical division is doing much better than it really is. And what your job is, to get those files and make sure that they are in Harley's hands before she goes to the board meeting tonight.",
        "Beth: So, Harley tells the board there's nothing to worry about, look at the numbers.",
        "Alan: Yeah, she's a hero for five minutes.",
        "Beth: And then when the real numbers come out she's charged with inflating profits.",
        "Alan: Well, yeah, everyone is doing it these days. And getting busted. Now, Mrs. Spaulding, why don't you go and help our little C.E.O. along, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: It was so easy being a cop. You know, suspect refuses to comply and I break his arm.",
        "Gus: Is it really that much different being a C.E.O.?",
        "Harley: Well, honey I can't walk around the company breaking everybody's arm.",
        "Gus: No. But should you do the job just the way that you did your old job as a cop. Right. Somebody comes on the street, you say, hey, I'm not going to show them any weakness, right? They come at you; they realize you're ready for the part they don't want, think part. You see their weakness, exploit that, take command of the situation.",
        "Harley: Well that's good. Okay, let's say I manage not to give somebody a black eye. I still have to come up with the numbers, you know I have to... I got to, you know, show them that I know what I'm doing. I got to show them I can put the company in the right direction.",
        "Gus: I think you know exactly what you're doing. I got faith in you. I think you said it before, you need help. And you need help from the inside.",
        "Harley: Well, I did ask Alex which seemed like a good idea at the time. Beth, she offered her help. But maybe just figure out which one of those two I trust the least and then go with the other one?",
        "Gus: No, you see I think those two, I they think cancel each other out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Are you out of your mind? You let Edmund go; he's a complete psycho. Why would you let him back on the street.",
        "Mallet: We have laws in this country.",
        "Dinah: I don't care about laws.",
        "Mallet: Really? Really. Really. That surprises me.",
        "Dinah: Mallet, he scares me, that's it. Okay, I know that I come off as tough and fearless, but the whole time this man had me locked up, that's it, he is one fava bean away from Hannibal Lechter, all right? He's out there and he's going to come after me.",
        "Mallet: Trust me. Okay, just trust me. I will not let him get to you.",
        "Dinah: Do you know if he knows that I'm helping you, what that's going to do.",
        "Mallet: He will not get to you.",
        "Dinah: Okay, I'm sorry. I'm not usually this uptight. I'm wound up. I'm wound up.",
        "Mallet: That's all right.",
        "Dinah: I am grateful to you. For protecting me, okay? Thank you so much.",
        "Mallet: That's what I do.",
        "Dinah: Well, thank you. It makes me feel safe; I appreciate it.",
        "Mallet: Mm-hmm. Oh, Dinah. You're welcome. I mean for all of it. Now, can I have my gun back please?",
        "Mallet: Give me my gun unless you're plan on shooting me.",
        "Dinah: You know what? We'll see. I'd rather you save me the trouble and just let go do what I need to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: I think I got it all covered. You can go. Because one of us has to have a job when I crash and burn.",
        "Gus: Babe, I think-- listen to me, I think you are the best thing that ever happened to Spaulding Enterprises. Do you hear me?",
        "Mallet: Hey.",
        "Gus: How are you doing?",
        "Mallet: Good.",
        "Gus: Something wrong?",
        "Dinah: No. I just would like to eat.",
        "Mallet: Are you going down to the house, man? Will you punch me in?",
        "Gus: The big house?",
        "Mallet: Yeah.",
        "Gus: Listen to you, little rule breaker. Yeah, I'll punch you in.",
        "Mallet: Now, would you just pull yourself together?",
        "Dinah: You know what? Edmund took my life away. He would have let me die in that house.",
        "Mallet: I get that, okay? I understand that. I understand what you've been through. You're going to need some help.",
        "Dinah: You're going to help me?",
        "Mallet: Yes.",
        "Dinah: Ow! What is up with you? You could have busted me with Gus. Why didn't you?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I didn't, did I? I didn't.",
        "Dinah: No, I can see that, why?",
        "Mallet: You just believe me right now, right? Because I wasn't lying. I'm going to help you.",
        "Dinah: You want something.",
        "Mallet: I want to save your life.",
        "Dinah: Then give me your gun back.",
        "Mallet: ( Laughs ) No, no, no.",
        "Dinah: Oh, no. Fine. I will handle Edmund if I have any chance to get my life back and I don't need your gun to go do that.",
        "Mallet: Hey, Dinah. We'll catch you.",
        "Dinah: Well, the last guy I killed vanished. And nobody sees me in jail yet.",
        "Man: Not yet. Remember me, Ms. Marler. The name is Wendell. I'm your probation officer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Okay, yeah, just don't anybody panic. I'm coming back to the office right now.",
        "Beth: Harley, your assistant told me I could find you here. My car is parked out back, there are more of these in the trunk.",
        "Harley: Wait a minute. What are these?",
        "Beth: Everything you need to know about Spaulding pharmaceuticals. Let's get started.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: No one was there.",
        "Frank: Officer Cooper, I gave you a direct order not to pick up this phone.",
        "Marina: I disobeyed you, Sir.",
        "Danny: Frank, come on.",
        "Marina: Stay out of it, Danny.",
        "Frank: I am your boss and I'm also your father. Don't ask me to choose between the two of them because I don't know just happens to be a job the other one has been my life's work. Now you're dragging personal business in here.",
        "Marina: No, sir, I am not.",
        "Frank: Then you're expecting preferential treatment.",
        "Marina: No, sir. I joined the police to be the police that's what I want to do, be the police. But what I don't want to do is railroad innocent people because I can, because I hold a grudge.",
        "Frank: Young lady get over here, you are making a mistake. Do you really want him out there looking for his ex-wife?",
        "Marina: I though about what I'm doing.",
        "Frank: I know exactly what you're doing. What you're doing is you're being selfless. And I love you for that. But there are limits.",
        "Marina: Then let me find them.",
        "Frank: A good father never, ever abandons his children.",
        "Danny: Frank. I'm a father, too. Listen to me. Dinah brought me that baby because it's mine and it's Michelle's. And I need to find Michelle so that I can tell her that her baby is alive, but I will not leave here if it puts Marina's career in jeopardy. She's been working way too hard.",
        "Marina: Danny, this is too important.",
        "Danny: So are you.",
        "Frank: You better turn yourself in when this whole matter is cleared up. Do you understand what I'm saying?",
        "Danny: Yes, I will. I will. Thank you.",
        "Marina: Go.",
        "Danny: I'll call you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Why did you just disconnect my call?",
        "Edmund: You didn't want to talk to Danny, Michelle. You came here to get alone, get away from everyone. I know the temptation is to weaken and give in and I didn't want to see do you that. Come on, sit.",
        "Michelle: Thank you. Thank you for stopping me. I mean, it does help having a friend going through the same meat grinder that you are, not that I would wish it on anyone.",
        "Edmund: Oh, you should see that sky, it's fantastic. Dramatic.",
        "Michelle: Looks like there's a huge storm coming.",
        "Edmund: There is. It's going to. Hey, let's go see it before it storms. Let's go for a drive.",
        "Michelle: Really?",
        "Edmund: Yeah. Your not scared, Michelle, are you? Of the storm?",
        "Michelle: Of course not.",
        "Edmund: Good. I'll bring the car around.",
        "Michelle: Why are you really here, Edmund? District Court of the State of Illinois, these papers are from jail. Count one, kidnapping. Oh, my, God.",
        "Michelle: Oh, Edmund. Kidnapping? Oh, my, God.",
        "Edmund: I mapped out quite a route for us to the other side of the lake, the leaves are thickest this time of year.",
        "Michelle: It's pretty quiet out there. Nobody's around. What are we going to do?",
        "Edmund: Enjoy being some place where nobody can get to us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wendell: Thanks for holding her.",
        "Dinah: I appreciate you wanting to take this one down. Obviously Miss Dinah is a big fish to land, but she's mine.",
        "Wendell: What do you mean, yours?",
        "Mallet: She belongs to me. She's my go-to girl, okay? My snitch, my coffee maid. She's whatever I want her to be up until the hearing. I was just getting ready to bring her in.",
        "Wendell: You're arresting her?",
        "Mallet: No, no, no. I'm bringing her in for something much bigger than a simple parole violation. I have been working on a case for months, okay? So I don't need some glorified baby-sitter putting me off my game plan. We'll see you around. Take care. Thank you. What are you doing? My job, okay. I will get her to the hearing on time. You tell everybody in your office that Miss Dinah Marler's in my custody.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Those revenues for press releases, but this number here, Harley, this is your bread and butter. And at Spaulding Pharmaceuticals, there's more than enough bread to go around.",
        "Harley: Really? Because the board seems convinced that --",
        "Beth: Look at the numbers. They're promising. And I think that the board will see it that way, too, if it's put to them in the right way.",
        "Harley: The right way, huh?",
        "Beth: Let me show you.",
        "Harley: Beth, um, what's the deal?",
        "Beth: What do you mean what deal?",
        "Harley: Come on. You hate that I got this job over you. Yet you come running down here to save the day for me? Come on.",
        "Beth: Okay. You're right. I do hate that you have this job. I hate living with you. I hate the way you dress. Your accessories, your perfume, your taste for beer. I hate your shoes.",
        "Harley: You don't like my shoes?",
        "Beth: Oh, Harley. But the bottom line is, I will not allow the board to roll over on a member of this family, and threaten the legacy of a Spaulding running Spaulding. You're just borrowing that C.E.O.'s chair. Lizzie will be in it soon enough.",
        "Harley: Or Zach.",
        "Beth: Or James. Helping you is the lesser of all evils. That's the way this family works.",
        "Harley: Well. Okay then. Let's get crackin'.",

        "Alan: \"Marley ran her hands down the Warden's chest, she could feel not only the scars on the outside, but the wounds he still carried on the inside as well. The old wounds, the wounds which refuse to close and she wanted to heal them. She pulled his head down, her lips aching to reach his.\"",

        "Marina: Thank you.",
        "Frank: For what? For what did I as your dad or as your chief?",
        "Marina: Both.",
        "Frank: Still doesn't change the fact that you disobeyed a direct order. I guess you got what you wanted.",
        "Marina: I know and I shouldn't have.",
        "Frank: Hold on a second. Did you think for two seconds how easy it was for to you break the rules?",
        "Marina: None of this is easy for me, Dad. But I'm just trying to get through it the best way I can. Okay? The guy that I love is out there chasing his ex- wife, who still loves him. Nothing is the way I want it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Come on! Damn it. Do I have to do everything the hard way? When it comes to my own child. I am just trying to do the right thing. You are going to help me. You hear me? You are going to help me!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: I don't think we're going to need anything for our little trip around the lake so you don't have to pack any food or drinks or anything.",
        "Michelle: I just thought that maybe we should be a little prepared in case we get stuck out there.",
        "Edmund: We won't. Let's go.",
        "Michelle: You know, Edmund, I don't really like the way the roads look. They're just a little too wet already.",
        "Edmund: I know. But I think this trip is going to do us a world of good.",
        "Michelle: I'm going to have to say no, Edmund. All right? I don't want to go. You can go ahead. You just go on without me. I think you should take the time for yourself. You need it.",
        "Edmund: So this is it? The big brush off?",
        "Michelle: No.",
        "Edmund: Shhh. Don't ruin the moment.",
        "Michelle: What moment?",
        "Edmund: The moment when I look into your eyes and I say, I know you're on to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Are you aware that I can make your stay here very miserable while you're waiting for your transfer?",
        "Alan: Yeah. This is really good stuff. You do whatever you have to do as long as you don't take my books.",
        "Gus: Well that's funny should you say that. I was just on my way over here to take all of your books.",
        "Alan: Okay, as long as you don't take this one.",
        "Gus: Let me ask you something. Did you hear about the possible hostile take over of Spaulding Pharmaceuticals.",
        "Alan: Yes, as a matter of fact.",
        "Gus: What do you make of that?",
        "Alan: I think Harley is doing an excellent job. And I am rather surprised it will be a rough ride, but I'm sure she'll hold on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: I think that the company seems solid.",
        "Beth: It looks that way. And the best part is, people like working for you. I hate to admit it, but people want to see you succeed.",
        "Harley: Well, give 'em time because you know there is time enough for me to fall flat on my face. Harley here.",
        "Gus: I think you're being played.",
        "Harley: Yes, I was aware of that fact. But I'd like to you update me on the situation as it develops, however I am in a meeting.",
        "Gus: Who could that be with you, Mrs. Spalding perhaps?",
        "Harley: You got that right. Furthermore, I'm feeling a lot better about the situation at hand. It's a lot easier to understand the process when someone makes themselves available to you to see exactly what you're up against.",
        "Gus: All right. Watch your back, okay? I'll see you at home.",
        "Harley: That was my assistant. Thank you for everything, Beth. Really, but there are calls I've got to get back to.",
        "Beth: Maybe I could just stick around.",
        "Harley: C.E.O.'s job is never done, you know that.",
        "Beth: I understand. I will leave you to look at these net projections on your own.",
        "Harley: Beth, I can call you if I have a question or anything, right?",
        "Beth: Absolutely. I'm just glad that I could be of help.",
        "Harley: Well, I have to tell you I'm so excited to go back to the board with these numbers. I mean, I can convince them that the division, pharmaceutical division is thriving.",
        "Beth: And isn't that what we all want? Great.",
        "Harley: Beth, thank you. Nice try Beth. Do I really look that stupid? There's got to be a way to get the real numbers. Somebody at that company knows. I just have to figure out who it is.",

        "Michelle: All I know Edmund is we are friends, okay? You're my friend. And I do not believe that you would lie to me. I'm sorry if I gave you that impression before that I doubted you. I don't.",

        "Michelle: What do you mean? Did do you something to Cassie?",
        "Edmund: There you go! There you go, you just jump to conclusions that I've hurt Cassie, assuming that I can hurt that woman when all I've ever really done is tried to love her. I tried to love her, Michelle, I gave her everything I had. Everything. Everything that was on the inside I gave it to her. I gave it to her. My heart just sort of snapped under the strain. Everything. Michelle, I gave her everything. She never really trusted me. I mean not really ever trusted me because nothing I ever did, no, was ever good enough!",

        "Edmund: I know, I know, I know, Michelle. I know you're sorry, but you are really no better -- don't get me wrong, Cassie broke the land speed record jumping into Jeffrey O'Neill's bed. You're just as capable of befouling a marriage as she is.",
        "Michelle: You have no right to judge me, okay. You have no right.",
        "Edmund: What do you mean? Because of my past? Because of all the bad things I've done in my life, is that it, Michelle? I still know what it is to be a married man. I'm talking about what's sacred, Michelle. I'm talking about a marriage. I'm talking about two people promising to love one another for the rest of their lives and actually doing it!",
        "Michelle: I believe that, too, Edmund, I do. Maybe it's not too late for you and Cassie.",
        "Edmund: No, no, no. It's not too late. It's not too late because she loved me once. She's going to love me again. There's just one thing standing our way.",
