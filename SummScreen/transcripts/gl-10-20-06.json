        "Buzz: You were a teenager.\r\nYou had to go through what no one should have to go through. You were taken\r\nadvantage of by this son of a bitch, whoever it was. ",
        "Olivia: Whoever it was. ",
        "Buzz: It stinks! You didn't ask for any of\r\nit. Your little girl didn't ask for any of it. Ava didn't ask for any of it.\r\nHate what was done to you, but don't hate her. ",
        "Olivia: I can't let it go! I can't! ",
        "Buzz: You've got to try with her. You're her\r\nmother. You and Emma are the only family she has. I mean, whatever happens at\r\nthat hearing today, that is something you're going to have to deal with. ",
        "Olivia: It's been too long. I don't know how\r\nto feel anything for her but hate. ",
        "Buzz: You saved her. You saved her. When you\r\nknew who she was. That's not hate. Deep down you don't hate her. ",
        "Olivia: Hey, sweetie, come here. Come here.\r\nWere you listening to mommy? Well, I don't hate anyone, okay? Can I tell you\r\nsomething? Remember when you were in the hospital and you were having those\r\ndreams about your sister, but it wasn't Lizzie? Well, I have something to tell\r\nyou. You have another sister. And I want to tell you about her. ",
        "",
        "Ava: Oop! ",
        "Alan-Michael: I think maybe you've had\r\nenough. ",
        "Ava: Really? Because last time I remember\r\nthe woman who tried to kill me turned out to be my mother. She has a hearing today,\r\nand I might have to send her to jail, and, um, oh, my boyfriend, yeah, he found\r\nout I was adopted and he forgot to tell me. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Coop told you he forgot? ",
        "Ava: Not really, but good excuse for another\r\nvodka tonic, right? ",
        "Alan-Michael: But here's the thing, Ava.\r\nYou're in my room. ",
        "Ava: So? There's mini bars in ever room. ",
        "Alan-Michael: No, what I mean is, while\r\nyou're here I'm responsible for you. ",
        "Ava: Fine. Then take responsibility. ",
        "",
        "Coop: She'll come back when she cools off.\r\nJust have a little faith. ",
        "Remy: Hey, man. ",
        "Marina: Hey, Uncle Henry. What's happening? ",
        "Coop: I don't think you guys really want to\r\nknow. ",
        "Marina: Okay. ",
        "Coop: Look, have either of you guys seen Ava\r\nat all? ",
        "Marina: Not my day to watch her. (Laughs) ",
        "Coop: Thanks. ",
        "Marina: Hey, I'm sorry. What's up? ",
        "Coop: I made a pretty big mistake, and I\r\ndon't know if I can fix it. ",
        "",
        "Alan: I brought you a cold soda, Elizabeth. How are you feeling? \r\n",
        "Lizzie: The same. Maybe if I walked out\r\nthere a little bit. ",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, doctor's orders, you are to stay in bed. You almost\r\nlost your child. ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. ",
        "Alan: Now, I don't blame you at all for\r\nbeing angry with Jonathan for walking out again on you when you needed him the\r\nmost. ",
        "Lizzie: He says that he cares about me. ",
        "Alan: I know, but I think it's very clear to\r\nyou now who really cares for you, and it's your family. Your mother and I will\r\nalways be there for you and your baby. Now, listen, sweetheart, I've got to go\r\ntake care of some family business, but your mother will be here shortly. So I\r\nthink it would be best if you tried to get as much rest as possible. ",
        "Beth: Alan? ",
        "Alan: Oh, Beth, I was just telling Lizzie\r\nyou'd be here. ",
        "Beth: How is she? ",
        "Alan: Well, she's starting to come around.\r\nLet me know when the doctor decides to release her. ",
        "",
        "Tammy: We both know it's true, Jonathan. You\r\nhave to make a choice. It's the baby or us. ",
        "Jonathan: You don't know that. ",
        "Tammy: Before yesterday, I really didn\u2019t.\r\nBut when we saw Lizzie in trouble, something changed, the way you were with her.\r\n",
        "Jonathan: I was worried about the baby. ",
        "Tammy: You felt guilty. You felt guilty\r\nbecause you were with me when they needed you. ",
        "Jonathan: No, Tammy, no. ",
        "Tammy: I saw it, Jonathan. And it was\r\nkilling you, and that killed me. You can't keep this up for the rest of your\r\nlife. ",
        "Jonathan: Yes, I can. ",
        "Tammy: Even if you could, I couldn't let\r\nyou. We've been trying to have it both ways for a long time, and it nearly cost\r\nyou your baby, and you just don't want to admit that because... because it's\r\ngoing to cost you me. ",
        "Jonathan: I'm not listening to this. ",
        "Tammy: Jonathan, please. ",
        "Jonathan: You're giving up. ",
        "Tammy: When we first got together, it was so\r\nintense, you know? As soon as I thought I couldn't possibly love you any more,\r\nyou would prove me wrong. And I felt like I could see things in you that no one\r\nelse could see. ",
        "Jonathan: You're giving up. ",
        "Tammy: But these last few months, you've\r\nshown everyone. And to see you put out there what I knew was in you all along,\r\nit has been an amazing thing, to see how you are about your baby... ",
        "Jonathan: But I don't care... I love you, Tammy.\r\nIt's always you before the baby, before anything else. ",
        "Tammy: You tried to put me first, I know\r\nthat. ",
        "Jonathan: I'm still trying to put you first.\r\n",
        "Tammy: You think I don't care, Jonathan?\r\nThis is breaking my heart. I wanted us to spend the rest of our lives together,\r\ntoo. ",
        "Jonathan: And what? I mean, now, you just...\r\nyou don't anymore? ",
        "Tammy: I'm just saying that we have to get\r\nreal. ",
        "Jonathan: We are real. This is real. Me and\r\nyou is real. I was going to divorce Lizzie. It was going to be the end of the\r\nwhole stupid thing between the three of us. ",
        "Tammy: We both know it can't have an end. If\r\nanything, this baby is just the beginning. ",
        "Jonathan: Well, I don't know. You know, it\r\ncould have happened anyway. Even if I was standing right there with Lizzie, she\r\ncould have gotten sick, whatever, lost the baby. Even if I was standing right\r\nthere, but she didn't, okay? So now everything is fine. It's okay. ",
        "Tammy: It's not okay. ",
        "Jonathan: I mean, you see one thing in my\r\nface for like a second, and then you change your whole mind about everything? \r\n",
        "Tammy: I just can't keep pretending that we\r\ncan make this work. We've tried everything. I know that, and you know that,\r\ntoo. ",
        "Jonathan: Stop. Stop. You... this is your\r\nfault. ",

        "Beth: Okay. Maybe you'd like something to\r\nread, huh? A magazine? ",
        "Lizzie: You and granddad don't have to watch\r\nme every single second. ",
        "Beth: Yes, we do, as a matter of fact,\r\nbecause leaving you alone is what landed you here in the first place. I'm not\r\ngoing anywhere until we know that that baby is okay. ",
        "Lillian: The baby is out of danger. ",
        "Lizzie: She is? ",
        "Beth: Thank God. ",
        "Lillian: They're going to keep you here as\r\nan extra precaution, honey, but if you want to leave, just let me know and I'll\r\npush for it. ",
        "Lizzie: No, I'll stay. I mean, I don't want\r\nyou to go to any trouble. ",
        "Lillian: Oh, honey, it's no trouble. ",
        "Beth: No, no, Mom, I'm with Lizzie. I think\r\nthat she's making a very mature decision. ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I don't want the... you know,\r\nbaby to be at risk or anything. ",
        "Lillian: Is that all, Lizzie? ",

        "Alan: I'm leaving the hospital now and on my\r\nway to the courthouse. I'll meet you there. We're not leaving until we get the\r\ncharges against Olivia dropped. Do you understand? She doesn't have time for\r\nthese Ava Peralta games. She has to take care of my granddaughter Emma. ",

        "Remy: What about that one? ",
        "Marina: No! ",
        "Remy: Man, sit down, please. Help us argue\r\nabout what color to paint our new place. ",
        "Marina: Yeah, he just wants good backup. ",
        "Remy: Exactly. ",
        "Coop: Well, it's nice that you guys are\r\ntrying to get your nice place organized. ",
        "Remy: I'm just trying to get a word in\r\nbefore it becomes two against one. ",
        "Coop: Oh, right. Tammy. ",
        "Marina: You know, I think I should be the one who's worried\r\nabout being the loser on the outside here. Once Tammy moves in, this one is not\r\ngoing to listen to a word I say. ",
        "Coop: I forget you had a little thing for\r\nher. You know, it's dangerous territory, right? ",
        "Remy: Dude, all women are dangerous. ",
        "Coop: Yeah, I agree, but not all women come\r\nwith Jonathan Randall lurking around. ",
        "Marina: Thank you, Coop. Now I will have two lovesick dogs\r\non my hands. ",
        "Coop: Hey, I am fine, all right? I haven't\r\nthought about Ava once today. Lynn, have you seen Ava at all? Stop, okay? Just don't\r\neven start. Look, I thought I saw her come in before, maybe in the back. Do you\r\nknow if she stopped by Co2 at all? ",
        "Lynn: Sorry, Coop. Did you try her cell? ",
        "Coop: I could try her again. Thank you. I...\r\nI... hey, what are you...? That's my phone. ",

        "Buzz: Well, it's not every day a little girl\r\nfinds out she has a new big sister. ",
        "Olivia: Yeah, well, she's a kid. She doesn't\r\nunderstand how complicated things get. ",
        "Buzz: I'm so glad you did that. ",
        "Olivia: She's going to hear it, eventually.\r\nI wanted her to hear it from me. ",

        "Olivia: She's happy when she gets a prize\r\nout of a cereal box, Buzz. She's a little girl. ",
        "Buzz: You know what I mean. Nothing can\r\nerase all the suffering you went through. Nothing can make you live with it\r\nanymore, but... ",
        "Olivia: You just want me to stop hating Ava,\r\njust like that? ",
        "Buzz: I know you wanted nothing to do with\r\nthe girl you gave away. I know you thought you hated Ava before you knew who\r\nshe was, but you brought two girls into the world. You're their mother; you're\r\ntheir connection. So if you can't do it for your own good, do it for theirs. \r\n",
