        "Cassie argues with Tammy about her going camping with J.B. and finds out that she loves him and has already slept with him. Dinah maneuvers Edmund into coming to Jeffrey's suite while he is out. She pretends to be breaking into Jeffrey's safe for money so that Edmund will feel sorry for her and find a picture of Richard and Cassie (which she says is Jeffrey). She also tells him that when she sleeps with Jeffrey, he calls her \"Cassie\". Jeffrey sees the two of them in his suite and is curious, but she covers it up. Reva and Josh are upset about J.B. Reva goes to Cassie and tells her that he is really her son, which disgusts Cassie. She prepares to tell Tammy the truth. Jonathan visits Sandy in his hospital room; he taunts him and roughs him up, then ties him to his bed with his restraints and gags him. Sandy is frantic to save Tammy from going off with Jonathan. Josh meets with Jeffrey to ask him if he can have Sandy and J.B. arrested, but he doesn't tell Jeffrey any reason so he can't. Josh also visits Sandy and takes out the gag. When Reva returns home, Jonathan is waiting there for her."

        "Dinah: Ooh.",
        "Jeffrey: You know what happened to goldilocks when she crawled into someone else bed? The big bad wolf ate her all up.",
        "Dinah: Well, I think maybe you're getting your fairytales mixed up. But you go ahead and devour me and huff and puff and blow my blouse down.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I'm surprised you're still interested considering there's no audience.",
        "Dinah: You mean Cassie?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, you practically did a jig the other day when she caught us kissing.",
        "Dinah: Oh, I know. I know. It's amazing how jealous she seemed. Maybe your infatuation isn't one sided after all. Oh, that's right. The big bad wolf is the strong and silent type, huh? Never want to admit his feelings.",
        "Jeffrey: You know what I'm feeling?",
        "Dinah: What? Why don't you tell me?",
        "Jeffrey: My legs falling asleep.",
        "Dinah: Whoa!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Why would Reva call and ask if Tammy was home? If it's so important she couldn't stay on the phone.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, if it was really important, Reva would have come last night.",
        "Cassie: Something's wrong. Something's wrong and she's upset. I know it has something to do with that creep JB.",
        "Edmund: That creep JB is far away. Tammy's upstairs sleeping. So whatever it is, it doesn't matter.",
        "Cassie: I'm going to call her. I'm going to call her and got to get all these crazy things out of my head.",
        "Tammy: Hey, guys. You're the only ones here.",
        "Cassie: Who are you expecting? Reva maybe? She did call though.",
        "Tammy: And what did she say?",
        "Cassie: She wanted to know if you were home. You want to tell me what's going on?",
        "Tammy: We just bumped into each that's all. I'm off.",
        "Cassie: Off where?",
        "Tammy: To the mountains with Kyra and her family.",
        "Cassie: Mountains. What mountains?",
        "Tammy: It's wherever they go every year. It's kind of like a family thing and they invited me to go along. It's cool, right?",
        "Cassie: Wrong. Do you think I'm stupid? You're going off with that boy, aren't you?",
        "Sandy: I knew you'd come back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Well, can you have him call me as soon as he comes in. I can't tell you how important this is. I know you haven't seen him yet. Thank you.",
        "Josh: Who was that?",
        "Reva: Farley's bar. I know that Jonathan goes in there and I thought that...",
        "Josh: He'd be there drinking this time of the morning?",
        "Reva: I have to find him, Joshua.",
        "Josh: Mm-hmm.",
        "Reva: I don't know where he lives. I don't know who he is. I don't know anything about him.",
        "Josh: You know enough to stay away from him, Reva. If I understand the situation correctly, he slept with Tammy--his cousin--took her virginity away on purpose to hurt you. Now why would you even try to get close to this guy?",
        "Reva: Because He's my son. He is. I know how awful and ugly this is, but I have to find him.",
        "Josh: Did you tell Cassie what happened?",
        "Reva: Not yet. I thought maybe if I waited till morning, it would get easier, but it's not. It's just... it's worse. It's so much worse.",
        "Josh: Okay. What can I do? How can I help?",
        "Reva: I don't know. I just... I don't know. He just must be so angry and so filled with hate. And I keep thinking maybe if I could find him, if I could talk to him and tell him what happened...",
        "Josh: Stop.",
        "Reva: ...And tell him why I had to give him away.",
        "Josh: Stop. Stop trying to defend him. What he did was sick. It is inexcusable. And there's nothing you could do to change that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Hi, yes, this is Jenny from the DA's office. Ambassador Winslow requested some information about a Jonathan Randall. Right. And Mr. O'Neill would like to meet him now at his Beacon suite. Yeah. That would be great thank you.",
        "Jeffrey: I thought you were leaving.",
        "Dinah: Not until I apologize.",
        "Jeffrey: Apologize? For what?",
        "Dinah: Well, for giving you a hard time about Cassie. Look she can't help what she feels for you anymore than you could help what you feel for her. You know what? You're right. I need to get a handle on my own life. Stay out of everybody's else.",
        "Jeffrey: What are you doing?",
        "Dinah: I... well, I'm organizing you. Look, I know that that you only hired me to stay out of Cassie's hair. But I'm going to become your adoring little shadow, your dependable right arm. The best little PR person you'd ever had.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, now you really are scaring me.",
        "Dinah: Comb your hair, okay. You've got an appointment in exactly 18 minutes.",
        "Jeffrey: I totally forgot about that. Okay. I need my red file, please.",
        "Dinah: Right here.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, thank you. Thank you, and my briefcase.",
        "Dinah: Right here.",
        "Jeffrey: My briefcase. Thank you.",
        "Dinah: Go to your appointment and I will hang here and I will try to reorganize this mess so you can actually find what you're looking for.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, okay. And by the way, I don't believe a word you said.",
        "Dinah: Why don't people trust me? Hi, there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Stop lying to me, Tammy. Whatever story you have concocted with your girlfriends is not going to fly. You are going off with JB.",
        "Tammy: Okay. Okay, you got me. I'm leaving with JB, and I knew you wouldn't be happy about it, so...",
        "Cassie: So you lied to me. (Phone rings)",
        "Tammy: I'm sorry. I just didn't want anyone to worry.",
        "Cassie: Okay, we, you know, we are going to have that conversation that I wanted to have with you at the hospital. I don't understand why you find this boy so important. No. Okay. I'm sorry. I do understand. I guess I just don't like it. I don't know. You're fresh off the rebound from Joey.",
        "Tammy: No, I'm not. I like JB Mom. Is that such a terrible crime? You just don't understand him, Mom. JB isn't like other guys. He's sensitive. Sure He's not your idea of the right kind of boyfriend...",
        "Cassie: But he has a heart of gold, right? Yeah, just like your father. I'm sorry, Tammy, but I cannot let you go away with that boy.",
        "Tammy: I'm going. I'm 18 and you can't tell me what to do.",
        "Cassie: As long as you live in my house. No, no, no. See, I don't want us to be like that, okay? Will you please hear me out?",
        "Tammy: Well, can you make it quick?",
        "Edmund: I have to go town for a meeting.",
        "Cassie: Fine. I'm fine. Go ... go ahead.",
        "Edmund: All right. Tammy, listen to your mother. She has your best interest at heart.",
        "Cassie: If you go away with JB, He is going to have certain expectations of you, okay. And I love you. And I don't want you to feel pressured into sleeping with someone until you're ready.",
        "Tammy: JB didn't try to pressure me into anything. I can't explain it, but when we're together it feels like we've known each other forever. What we have together is so strong, so right.",
        "Cassie: Tammy, have you already slept with him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "JB: Well, look who's back on his feet.",
        "Sandy: You went too far this time, Jonathan. I know what you did to Tammy.",
        "JB: Oh, that. Yeah, she loved it Sandy. She couldn't get enough. And to think that was her first time. Who would've believed that?",
        "Sandy: I could kill you!",
        "JB: Already tried. You only get one shot, Sandy. Now it's my turn.",
        "Sandy: What happened to you, man? You've always been sick, but when did you get this perverted?",
        "JB: Oh, I don't know. Maybe... maybe bouncing off the side of a mountain rattled my brains or something.",
        "Sandy: If you were any kind of a man, you would have come after me and not innocent girl.",
        "JB: But you're not innocent are you, Sandy? All that curiosity about my past. All those questions about my complicated life like you were really interested in it. When did you decide to take this life? My life?",
        "Sandy: I never decided. I thought you were dead.",
        "JB: Because you dropped me off a mountain.",
        "Sandy: No, no. No, you were screwing around and lost your footing and that's how you fell. I tried to catch you.",
        "JB: No, you let me fall.",
        "Sandy: No.",
        "JB: You wanted me to fall.",
        "Sandy: No.",
        "JB: Yes. And then you left, hoping that you'd never see me again.",
        "Sandy: Well, it looks like we all would have been better off if you haven't survived.",
        "JB: No. Don't say that. Look at what my survival has given me. A chance to meet my cousin, Tammy. A reunion with my old school chum, Sandy. And of course most importantly, the opportunity to spend some quality time with my mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: He's my son, Joshua. And the last time I saw him, he was this little boy. He was sweet and beautiful. And what happened to him? I mean, what could make him hate me so much that he would do something like this to Tammy?",
        "Josh: Nothing could explain that.",
        "Reva: No. There's got to be a reason.",
        "Josh: Reva, He's a deeply disturbed young man. He's a predator. And you can't fix that. You can't fix him. If you get involved and try to save this kid, it's going to be a problem for this entire family. Look. All right, I'm sorry. I'm not angry with you. I'm really not. I am furious with Jonathan and with Sandy for the agony they have brought upon you, and upon Tammy.",
        "Reva: I can't even imagine what this is going to do to her. I have to go talk to Cassie.",
        "Josh: I'll go with you.",
        "Reva: No.",
        "Josh: Reva, I don't want you to have to face this alone.",
        "Reva: I don't want to have to face this at all. But I have to do it! I mean how do I even start to tell Cassie... I mean do I just blurt it out or do... I mean how do you tell your sister that her daughter was... I have to go.",
        "Josh: You have to remember something, okay. Listen, just stop for a second. You are not responsible for this. Sandy and Jonathan, they made this mess. You have to start seeing them for what they are and deal with the reality of the situation.",
        "Reva: Whatever Jonathan is, whatever he's done, I gave birth to him.",
        "Josh: Reva, just...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Twenty-four... twenty- six and twenty-four. (Laughs) good ole Jeffrey. The same combination. Unbelievable. Okay. All right. Nothing very interesting in here. So let's spice things up a little. Good. Good. (Phone rings) hello? Ambassador Winslow. Please send him right up. Thank you. All right. When Hart caught Cassie stealing money at Lewis Oil, she was upset. She was very, very upset. Okay, poor Cassie. She was all broken up... the evening she was caught stealing money. Okay. Here we go. (Knock at the door)",
        "Edmund: Dinah? What are you doing?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Hi. This isn't what it looks like.",
        "Edmund: Well, it looks as if you're stealing.",
        "Dinah: Look please just... I wasn't... I wasn't going to take everything. I just need some extra cash that's all.",
        "Edmund: Dinah...",
        "Dinah: Edmund, please just turn around then act as if you haven't seen a thing. Please. I'm begging you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Josh, all right, what's this about? I had to pull myself out of an important meeting for this.",
        "Josh: I'm sorry about that, okay. But I have a situation on my hands that is almost beyond comprehension. I need your help. Okay, I need your help right now. It has to do with Reva's son.",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "JB: Well, I told you we were having the disappearance of Jonathan investigated.",
        "Josh: Yeah, well, you don't have to worry about that anymore. He's here. He's alive. He's in Springfield right now.",
        "Jeffrey: He is?",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Jeffrey: All right. Well, that's good news, right? That also proves that Sandy did not kill Jonathan.",
        "Josh: I almost wished he had.",
        "Jeffrey: What?",
        "Josh: This young man has done something to this family that is morally reprehensible. He's become a walking nightmare. And Sandy has become a first rate manipulator.",
        "Jeffrey: Slow... slow down. What's does Reva have to say about all of this?",
        "Josh: Well, see that's the problem. Reva blames herself for the monster that Jonathan has become. She thinks that she can reform him, and I'm here to tell you, that can't happen. This kid cannot be reformed. Reva... Reva can't see him for what he is, but I can, and I want him stopped. Both of them, Sandy and Jonathan stopped right now. Today.",
        "Jeffrey: Stopped?",
        "Josh: Yes.",
        "Jeffrey: Josh, where are you heading with this?",
        "Josh: It's very simple. I want you to figure out a way to send them both off to the nearest penitentiary.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: You stay away from her.",
        "JB: Nice try, Sandy. But you couldn't take me even if you hadn't come through major surgery. Does that hurt?",
        "Sandy: Yeah.",
        "JB: Huh? Hurt? That's nothing compared to what I've went through. Do you know how much pain I was in after that fall?",
        "Sandy: Great!",
        "JB: You listen to me. When I hit the ground I felt my legs break. I was out there for days hoping to fight off the snakes and vultures. But I... I promised myself... I promised myself...",
        "Sandy: You don't want to hurt them anymore. I won't let you.",
        "JB: Give me your hand. Shut up. I promised myself I would live to see you again.",
        "Sandy: So you come here and hurt innocent people?",
        "JB: No. No. Imagine my surprise when I come and find you here cuddled in the loving bosom of my family. It was almost more than I can bear.",
        "Sandy: So you snuck around like a coward? Hurting people who didn't even know they had to defend themselves? Huh? Hmm?",
        "JB: Hey. Hey, I don't exist remember. You took my place.",
        "Sandy: Why didn't you just go to Reva and expose me? Give yourself a chance to know her. She's great. The whole Lewis's is close. They took me in. They welcomed you with open arms.",
        "JB: Shut up.",
        "Sandy: Reva would have loved you like she loved me.",
        "JB: You will shut your mouth or this miraculous recovery will be very brief.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Please. Please tell me that you are not sleeping with that...",
        "Tammy: We don't discuss your sex life. Why should we discuss mine?",
        "Cassie: Because I'm hoping that you don't have one.",
        "Tammy: It's okay, Mom. I'm 18. It had to happen some time.",
        "Cassie: You met him a few weeks ago. I mean what could possibly know about this kid?",
        "Tammy: I know enough.",
        "Cassie: Oh, God. How could this have happened? I mean you're my little girl who plays with dolls and make peanut butter cookies.",
        "Tammy: I'm not a little girl anymore.",
        "Cassie: Oh, well, to me, you're always going to be my little girl, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: Mom, don't look so sad. I've never been happier, ever. And I know that JB doesn't get along with parents very well and all that stuff, but he's really a beautiful person ... really.",
        "Cassie: Oh, I said the same thing about your father. And he caused us so much pain. And now here you are doing the same thing I do.",
        "Tammy: Okay, don't go all psychological on me. Please. I need to go get some stuff out of storage.",
        "Cassie: What's stuff?",
        "Tammy: Just some blankets and that old ice chest. It's okay, right?",
        "Cassie: None of this is okay. Would you lighten up, Mom? Be happy for me. I really think I love him.",
        "Cassie: Oh, Oh, my God.",
        "Reva: Cassie. It's Tammy...",
        "Cassie: She... oh... JB, Tammy, they...",
        "Reva: I know.",
        "Cassie: What? You know?",
        "Reva: I knew. I knew. I mean that's why I was coming over here to tell you that I found out last night.",
        "Cassie: The worst thing that could happen, ever.",
        "Reva: Well, no it isn't. You should probably sit down.",
        "Cassie: What's going on?",
        "Reva: I've been going over and over this in my head trying to find the right way to tell you, but there...",
        "Cassie: Tell me. Tell me what?",
        "Reva: You know Sandy isn't my son?",
        "Cassie: Yes.",
        "Reva: And he's known about Jonathan for awhile that... well, that he's here in Springfield and you've met him.",
        "Cassie: Who?",
        "Reva: It's JB",
        "Cassie: JB you mean Tammy... no, no. Tammy and JB slept together, Reva. This cannot be true. I mean this is not true. It's not true, okay.",
        "Reva: I think he went after her to get even with me.",
        "Cassie: If I ever get my hands on that freak, I'm going to kill him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: But it's done now. It's done. So what we have to do is we have to find a way to make Tammy understand this.",
        "Cassie: Tammy can never know about this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: What sort of trouble are you in this time? Dinah?",
        "Dinah: If it wasn't necessary I would have never done it. I borrowed money before when I was in hiding. The lifestyle in Europe doesn't come cheap. And I didn't exactly borrow from bankers. I've saved every penny that Jeffrey's given me for being his assistant, but it goes fast. And I've been thinking about, I don't know, waitressing, dancing at one of those bars. But if anyone ever saw me just... oh, God, Edmund, please just don't. Don't say anything. Just forget everything.",
        "Edmund: All right. All right. How much money do you need?",
        "Dinah: No, Edmund. No, I don't want to put you in that position. I don't.",
        "Edmund: Look, I don't care. I don't care if you take O'Neill's money. I really don't. Just don't do it while I'm here.",
        "Dinah: Look I know that you have lots of appointments, all right. I know you do. And I will reschedule your appointment with Jeffrey as soon as possible.",
        "Edmund: What are you hiding?",
        "Dinah: Nothing. Just go, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Right, a picture of Richard and Cassie. Why does O'Neill keep this in his safe?",
        "Dinah: I'm afraid we've been through this before. I don't think that that's Richard.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Tammy thinks she's in love with him. I mean she told me that, Reva. She's in love with this guy.",
        "Reva: My God.",
        "Cassie: I knew it. I knew it. I knew it! I knew it was something about this kid. I chalked it up to his attitude, the booze, but I knew it. Down deep in here I knew it. And I should have done something to stop it. I should have done something to stop it.",
        "Reva: Hey, I don't think anyone could have stopped him. But look, it's done now. And we have to figure out a way to deal with it.",
        "Cassie: How could you be so calm? How can you be so calm? How can you not want to rip this kid apart? What he did to Tammy, it's rape, Reva.",
        "Reva: Cassie...",
        "Cassie: No. Don't. Don't. Don't you defend them.",
        "Reva: I'm not.",
        "Cassie: Don't you defend him.",
        "Reva: I'm not! I hate what he did. And I hate this whole situation, but I can't hate him. Cassie, He's my son.",
        "Cassie: Oh, Reva, when's the last time you seen him? He was what--six or seven? Come on.",
        "Reva: Yes. Which means something horrible must have happened between then and now to make him behave this way.",
        "Cassie: I don't care. I don't care. I will never care. I don't want to understand why he did it, and if you care anything about me or Tammy, you won't either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: (Gasping) what's the matter? You hate that Reva cares about me? Huh? That she might choose me over you?",
        "JB: Yeah, we'll see. We'll see.",
        "Sandy: No we won't. She'll never accept you now.",
        "JB: Oh, gee, I'm all broken up about that. I mean, gosh, this family just seem so swell. Well, there's Mommy, who didn't even recognize me. Daddy, who's six feet under and buried and dear, dear Uncle Eddie. The guy who tried to snuff me before I was even out of diapers. Gosh, Sandy, what I do to make them love me? What?",
        "Sandy: Nothing.",
        "JB: The only one I have any use for is Tammy anyway. She's a lot of fun.",
        "Sandy: No, you're finished with Tammy. (Phone rings)",
        "JB: Oh, let's see what she has to say about that. Hey, babe.",
        "Tammy: I just wanted to hear your voice.",
        "JB: Oh, it's really good to hear your voice. So you all set to hit the road?",
        "Sandy: Tammy! No! No!",
        "Tammy: Just about. I found some blankets and stuff in case we need to camp out.",
        "JB: You are not only beautiful, you're smart, too. I'll see you soon?",
        "Tammy: Really soon. Love you. I mean... I didn't mean...",
        "JB: Oh, no, no, it's cool. I love you, too. Isn't that sweet? She loves me.",
        "Sandy: Leave her alone.",
        "JB: Oh. Ooh. You're scaring me sand man. But maybe I will back off Tammy. All depends on how much you're willing to sacrifice for this family you claim to love.",
        "Sandy: What do you want?",
        "J.B: Okay. I'd be willing to let Tammy go if...",
        "Sandy: If what?",
        "JB: You confess you tried to kill me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Cassie...",
        "Cassie: No, there is nothing. Nothing that you can say to make this better, Reva.",
        "Reva: I was going to say you're right. That I've been blind. But it's not your fault, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Reva...",
        "Reva: It's not your fault. No, let me finish, please. I've made a lot of mistakes. And the moment that Sandy told me he was my son, I wanted to believe it, because I wanted to believe that Jonathan was okay. That he could be in my life. That he could know me and that he could love me. That I could make up for all the time that I didn't have with him. But I should have known it was too perfect. That I should have looked at it more closely. Maybe if I had, then Tammy wouldn't have been hurt. But it's done now. So what we have do is we have to find a way to make Tammy understand this. We have to find a way to tell her that won't make it so...",
        "Cassie: Tell her? Tammy can never know about this. Never.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: I want this kid Jonathan in a cage before he can pull anything else.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, I got that, Josh. But you know, I just can't throw a kid into jail. You know, you can't even tell me what he did.",
        "Josh: Well, I can't let Jonathan get away with what they've done.",
        "Jeffrey: Maybe there's another way to handle the situation.",
        "Josh: Are we talking about good old fashion Oklahoma styled justice here? Is that wha ...",
        "Jeffrey: Hang on, Josh. I'm not suggesting you--",
        "Josh: No, that's fine for me. That's good. I can handle that. That's fine. Thank you. I'll take full responsibility.",
        "Jeffrey: Josh?",
        "Josh: No, really. Really. I know what I have to do. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: How would you feel if you were Tammy? How would you feel if you slept with your cousin?",
        "Reva: Look, I know that this is awful, but I don't know how we cannot tell her who he is.",
        "Cassie: We make him go away. We make him vanish. Sorry, Tammy, but your cute boyfriend JB left town. You could find somebody else.",
        "Reva: It won't work!",
        "Cassie: Then we bribe him.",
        "Reva: And what if he doesn't take it? Or worse. What if he does accept it and then he comes back? And one night when you're least expect it, you go in and Tammy's not her bed and there's a note there saying: \"I've gone away with JB,\" and you don't know where in the world she is. Is that the way you want to handle this?",
        "Cassie: No, no!",
        "Reva: Tammy has to know who he is so that she could stay away from him. Because the longer she's kept in the dark, the more at risk she is.",
        "Cassie: She's fragile, Reva. She's insecure. She was just rejected by Joey and now this guy comes along... how do I tell her? How?",
        "Reva: Would you rather I did it?",
        "Cassie: No! No. No. I have to do this. I have to do this.",
        "Reva: It's going to be okay. You'll find the words. You will. Because your love for her will be enough.",
        "Tammy: Enough for what?",
        "Reva: You want me to stay?",
        "Cassie: No, no, no.",
        "Reva: I love you. You remember that.",
        "Tammy: Well, let me guess. You were figuring out how to keep me away from JB. Well, it's not going to work.",
        "Cassie: Tammy, come here.",
        "Tammy: No, I already told you nothing you could say will make me stop seeing him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "JB: All you have to do is go to the police, tell them you tossed me off the mountain like a cigarette butt.",
        "Sandy: Then you promise on whatever you still believe, you'll leave Tammy alone?",
        "JB: I won't even kiss those delicious lips again.",
        "Sandy: Done.",
        "JB: (Laughs) oh, this is good. I love it.",
        "Sandy: What? We have a deal, right?",
        "JB: No, we don't. I just wanted to see how far you'd be willing to go for those losers. There's no way I'd let Tam-Tam go. I'm having way too much fun.",
        "Sandy: If you touch her again, I will kill you for real.",
        "JB: Oh, man, you are pathetic. Do you know that? Getting all worked up about a family that's not even yours. They probably hate you as much as they hate me. God, it doesn't even matter to you, does it? You'd do anything to fit in somewhere. Anywhere.",
        "Sandy: Hey, get back here!",
        "JB: Hey, no can do! My little dove is waiting.",
        "Sandy: You know, Tammy... Tammy... Tammy... when she finds out who you are, she'll never want to see you again.",
        "J.B: That's...",
        "Sandy: Nurse!",
        "JB: That's the benefit of having such a big family. So many more people to mess with. First, Tammy then... hey, where's big sister Marah?",
        "Sandy: So help me, God, Jonathan. (Muffled) if you touch Marah, I will kill you. I will kill you.",
        "JB: Shut your mouth. Just shut your whiney little mouth. I will see you when we get back from our trip, okay. If we get back.",
        "Sandy: (Screams)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: They look very comfortable. You'd almost think that's actually Richard. Jeffrey well, then push the meeting back, Ryan. I can't be in ten places at once.",
        "Dinah: Give me the picture.",
        "Jeffrey: Dinah.",
        "Dinah: Give me the picture. Don't say a word.",
        "Jeffrey: I'll call you back. Oh, well, this ought to be good.",
        "Dinah: That's all right, Edmund. I'll tell him. We're having an affair.",
        "Edmund: What?",
        "Dinah: Just kidding. (Laughs) Boy, you should see the look on your faces. No, I was organizing things and Edmund stopped by so I invited him in. I'm sure I've been talking his head off though, right?",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Wait a minute. I must be missing something here. What are you doing here? Is this about your nephew?",
        "Dinah: Forget about Sandy. Okay, Edmund is late for an appointment. Go ahead.",
        "Edmund: We'll finish our conversation later.",
        "Jeffrey: What was that about?",
        "Dinah: Well, it seems that Cassie is not taking it too well, the kiss that she saw the other day. She seems to be obsessing on it.",
        "Edmund: That's enough, Dinah. That's enough with that, all right?",
        "Dinah: All right. I'll go. But aren't you going to thank me for organizing your desk the way it is? You like it?",
        "Jeffrey: I like it messy.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I know you do. Oh. Let me go. What are you trying to do?",
        "Edmund: What are you trying to do, Dinah?",
        "Dinah: What do you mean?",
        "Edmund: Don't play the dumb schoolgirl routine with me. The last time we played this game, I nearly killed Jeffrey O'Neill.",
        "Dinah: And not to mention Cassie and R.J.",
        "Edmund: No. You want me to go after O'Neill again and I want to know why.",
        "Dinah: All right. I guess it's because I want someone to hurt him the same way he's hurt me.",
        "Edmund: Sorry. The two of you seem to be getting along just fine.",
        "Dinah: No, I've been trying. But no matter what I do it's not enough. I can't make him happy, because I will never be what he wants me to be.",
        "Edmund: Which is what?",
        "Dinah: It's humiliating. I don't want to talk about it. When Jeffrey and I are together he has this thing.",
        "Edmund: What thing?",
        "Dinah: He likes to call me Cassie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: (Muffled) Josh.",
        "Josh: Hello, Sandy.",
        "Sandy: (Muffled) hey, hey.",
        "Josh: Where's Jonathan?",
        "Sandy: (Struggling to talk)",
        "Josh: You want me to help you with that?",
        "Sandy: (Muffled) yes.",
        "Josh: Just a second. This might hurt just a little how's that?",
        "Sandy: I have to go get Jonathan. He went after Tammy.",
        "Josh: Too late... for you. You had your chance to stop Jonathan, to do the right thing and you didn't do it. Now see Jonathan to me is nothing more to me than just a despicable piece of trash. You... you're pretty much the same thing, and you know what? I'm the guy who's here to take out the trash.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You are such... you're such a good person. Tammy, you are. And you're caring and you're giving. And I just want you to know that I'm so proud that you're my daughter.",
        "Tammy: Mom, what is going on?",
        "Cassie: There's something I need to tell you. And it's... it's really bad. And it's about JB he's...",

        "Cassie: No. You can't ever love him. And you can never be with him again.",
        "JB: I have always wanted to hurt you more than you've hurt me. So how am I doing?"
