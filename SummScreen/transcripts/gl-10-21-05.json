        "Sandy: ( Sighs ) ",
        "Ava: I was beginning to think you had\r\nforgotten about me. Why are you looking so surprised? Did you honestly think\r\nyou could hide from me forever? ",
        "Jonathan: Can I help put you in the\r\nwheelchair? It's no problem, just say the word. ",
        "Sandy: What do you want, Jonathan?\r\n",
        "Jonathan: A little birdie\r\ntold me you were getting out today. I thought I'd stop by and tell you not to\r\nstick your finger back in the socket. ( Makes buzz sound ) ",
        "Sandy: Ha-ha, ha-ha. So let's try this\r\nagain. What do you want? ",
        "Jonathan: I came to give you a going-home\r\npresent. This fell out of your lawyer's pocket. You need a new lawyer, dude.\r\nLook at this. \"I found you.\" I still don't know what it means. ",
        "Sandy: Again, what do you want? ",
        "Jonathan: I just want you to know that I am\r\nsniffing around like the dog I am. ",
        "Sandy: Uh-huh, you said it. ",
        "Jonathan: You're not as boring as I thought\r\nyou were. How's that Sandman? Listen, I know you're not feeling 100% so I'll be\r\nhonest with you. I know that you're hiding something from Tammy. And I know it\r\nand you know it. I'm going to figure out what it is. ",
        "",
        "Tammy: Perfect. Quiet and comfortable. And\r\nif he needs anything, I will be right here to take care of him. Welcome home, Sandy.\r\n",
        "Ava: Hello, Tammy. ",
        "Tammy: Ava! What are you doing here? ",
        "Ava: Dropping off papers and picking up\r\npapers. Olivia keeps me busy. How's your boyfriend. Improving? ",
        "Tammy: In fact, they're releasing him. I was\r\ngetting ready for Sandy to move in. ",
        "Ava: Move in here? ",
        "Tammy: This is where he belongs: With me. ",
        "",
        "Fallon: Yes, Mr. Foster, I am keeping a\r\ncareful eye on Ava. However... ",
        "Sandy: What? What's going on, Fallon? ",
        "Fallon: I have a feeling you won't be too\r\nhappy knowing where she is right now or who's she's talking to. ",
        "",
        "Cassie: You have been mine since the day you\r\nwere born. But you're not mine. No, sweetie, you belong to Danny and Michelle.\r\nThat's right. You do. Oh, man, I don't think I can do this. Oh, Cassie. You\r\nknow, Jeffrey says that I should fight for you, but I... I don't know if that's\r\nthe right thing for you. ",
        "Dinah: Hey there. ",
        "Cassie: Dinah. ",
        "Dinah: Hi, sweet pea. ",
        "Cassie: What are you doing here? What do you\r\nwant? ",
        "Dinah: Looking for you and Hope. ",
        "",
        "Danny: Michelle, I've been looking\r\neverywhere for you. ",
        "Michelle: Listen to me, you don't\r\nunderstand. Danny, you have to lock the door. Trust me, Danny... ",
        "Danny: I know you don't want to see me.\r\nThere's something you need to know. Listen to me. ",
        "Michelle: Danny, look out! Oh, my God, Danny!\r\nOh, my God. Danny! ",
        "",
        "Tammy: Wow, that was quite a look. I didn't\r\nmean to upset you. I guess people living together before they get married just\r\nisn't something that you're comfortable with. ",
        "Ava: Tammy, it's okay. It has nothing to do\r\nwith that. ",
        "Tammy: No, it's okay. I respect that. It's\r\nnot something I'm casual about, either. It's just that, well, Sandy and I lived\r\ntogether before so it feels normal. ",
        "Ava: You lived together when? ",
        "Tammy: We were just roommates. But\r\neverything's different now. In a good way. ",
        "Ava: It is? ",
        "Tammy: I think living together is a great\r\nway to get to know somebody. I mean before you get married. Then there aren't\r\nany of those unexpected surprises or anything. ",
        "( Cell phone rings ) ",
        "Ava: I'm sorry, excuse me. ",
        "Tammy: It's okay. I'll talk to you later. ",
        "Ava: Sure. Bye. Hello? ",
        "Sandy: I need to see you now. ",
        "Ava: Sorry, who is this? ",
        "Sandy: Ava, come to the hospital and meet\r\nme. ",
        "Ava: Where? In your room? ",
        "Sandy: No, it's too open. Upstairs on the\r\nroof. ",
        "Ava: All right. I'll be right over. ",
        "Sandy: Good. We can finally finish what we\r\nstarted. Put this whole mess behind me. And move on. ",
        "",
        "Dinah: I know that I'm the last person you\r\nwant to see, Cassie. ",
        "Cassie: There's a few people I'd like to see\r\nless. ",
        "Dinah: And I can imagine that that person is\r\nEdmund, which is why I'm here. You know he got out? ",
        "Cassie: Yes, I heard the good news. ",
        "Dinah: So we have to do something. The way\r\nhe treated us was horrible. ",
        "Cassie: \"Us?\" ",
        "Dinah: Fine. We are not the same, okay?\r\nEdmund kidnapped me, locked me up and tried to burn me alive. ",
        "Cassie: Yeah? ",
        "Dinah: The point is I don't think he should\r\nbe free to do any more damage. We know what he's capable of. ",
        "Cassie: Yeah, we do. ",
        "Dinah: Then do something before he does\r\nsomething to you. Cassie, we need to stick together on this one. ",
        "Cassie: Dinah, the only thing I care to do\r\nis hold on to this little girl until I don't have her any longer. ",
        "Dinah: And you know something? Believe it or\r\nnot, I don't want you to let her go, either. Cassie, do not let Edmund beat\r\nyou. No matter what it takes, don't let him win. ",
        "",
        "Michelle: Danny! ",
        "Edmund: Back off, Michelle. ",
        "Michelle: Why are you doing this, Edmund? ",
        "Edmund: You should have stayed in the car,\r\nthe moment you ran away I was obliged to do. Move away from Danny. ",
        "Michelle: The hell I will! ",
        "Edmund: Do it now! ",
        "Michelle: He better be all right, Edmund. I\r\nswear to God, I'm warning you, he better be all right. ",
        "Edmund: Call me crazy, Michelle, but you're\r\nnot in the position to issue demands, ultimatums or threats. Now grab his arms.\r\n",
        "Michelle: What? ",
        "Edmund: Grab his arms, we're\r\ntaking Danny for a drive. ",
        "Michelle: You think I'm\r\ngoing to help you? You're out of your mind! ",
        "Edmund: Grab his arms now\r\nor I'll disembowel him and use his stomach as a fruit cup. ",
        "Michelle: Leave him alone! ",
        "Edmund: I'm sorry I can't do that, but you\r\nknow there is something I can do for you. ",
        "Michelle: What are you talking about? ",
        "Edmund: I can make your dreams come true\r\nagain. Remember that time we spent together about how you wouldn\u2019t shut up\r\nabout the time you wanted to get together with Danny? I can do that for you, Michelle.\r\nYou can be back with Danny forever. ",
        "",
        "Tammy: Sandy, you ready to go... last minute\r\ntests, I guess. I better start packing up. God, I'm so grateful that Sandy\u2019s\r\nokay and that he's coming home. You kept up your end of our bargain. I swear\r\nthat if you let him walk out that door that I'd keep my distance from Jonathan,\r\nand that's exactly what I intend to do. ",

        "Ava: Geez! Sandy! ",
        "Sandy: Sorry. ",
        "Ava: You scared me! ",
        "Sandy: Just me. I didn't mean to make this\r\nany harder than it has to be. ",
        "Ava: You know, I was really surprised you\r\ncalled. ",
        "Sandy: Well, I figured if I'm going to leave\r\nthis behind me, we need to talk it out once and for all. ",
        "Ava: I'm not trying to make your life\r\ndifficult, Xander. ",
        "Sandy: I'm not Xander or Alexander anymore. ",
        "Ava: Right, you're Sandy. ",
        "Sandy: I'm not the same person I was. I made\r\na whole lot of changes. Trust me. ",
        "Ava: Trust you? ",
        "Sandy: I made a fresh start, I'm happy. I\r\nmet someone. ",
        "Ava: Someone? ",
        "Sandy: Someone I want to spend every day of\r\nmy life with. And I plan on asking her to marry me. And nobody can stop me,\r\nincluding you. ",
        "Ava: Right. ",
        "Sandy: I'm marrying Tammy, Ava. ",
        "Ava: I heard. ",
        "Sandy: Good. Then you can just let it go.\r\nNone of it means anything anymore. It's all in my past, all of it. As long as\r\nyou do what I told you to do. ",
        "Ava: I want you to give me something in\r\nexchange. Give me the ring. Tammy's ring. ",

        "Dinah: Cassie, you can't let her go. ",
        "Cassie: She's not mine. ",
        "Dinah: Yes, she is. I know what it's like to\r\nlive without a mother's love. You and I have that in common. ",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I know. ",
        "Dinah: Hope knows that you are her mommy. It\r\nis all she has ever known and that's all that matters. ",

        "Dinah: Great, here comes a bloodhound. ",
        "Cassie: Hi. ",
        "Mallet: Hey, Cassie, how are you doing? You\r\ntold me you were going to your fathers and he said you told him you were going\r\nto be with me. Do you know what I call that? ",
        "Dinah: Misunderstanding? My dear daddy, no\r\nmatter how much he denies it, he can't hear worth a lick. Look, it was a\r\nmix-up, I'm sure it won't be happening again, okay? ",
        "Mallet: I put myself on the line here, which\r\nis why you're able to be free like this. So don't be messin' okay? Don't be\r\nmessin'. ",
        "Dinah: Yes, sir. ",
        "Mallet: Can you keep your word? That's all\r\nI'm asking. Can you do that? ",
        "Dinah: I can do that. I promise you that.\r\nBrownie promise. In fact, I'm going to buy you something to eat. You just go\r\nahead name your sandwich. ",
        "Mallet: Huh. Um, okay, yeah. Yeah. I like\r\nsandwiches. ",
        "Dinah: Okay, good. Well, I'm going to guess.\r\nIt's going to be toasted white bread, righting? ",

        "Mallet: Look, for the record, there's a lot\r\nof questions hanging around out there and it seems to be more than one version\r\nof how this whole thing happened. ",
        "Cassie: This whole thing? ",
        "Mallet: Yeah. With the baby. I mean, with\r\nyour baby. Basically, we got Dinah\u2019s story on one side, we've got Edmund\u2019s\r\nstory on the other. I think Dinah\u2019s telling the truth. I believe her. ",
        "Cassie: What about Edmund? ",

        "Edmund: Stop postponing the inevitable. ",
        "Michelle: Edmund, when I walk out that door,\r\nI won't have a lot of time, am I? If this is the last bit I get, I'm going to\r\ntake my time in saying good-bye to it. ",
        "Edmund: Please tell me you're joking. ",
        "Michelle: You don't understand. I've had\r\nsome of the best moments of my life in this house. Haven't you had memories\r\ngrowing up as a kid that you love and cherish? ",
        "Edmund: No. All of them I'd like to forget. ",
        "Michelle: Well not me, okay? I've had\r\nmillions and millions of memories here. Wonderful times. There's got to be\r\ntrunks and trunks full of pictures up in the attic here, okay? And Danny and I,\r\nwe would spend hours, hours up there. I mean, we would walk up those rickety\r\npull-down attic stairs through the trap door and we would look through\r\nsnapshots of photo albums and the next thing you know three hours had gone by.\r\n( Screams ) ",
