        "Lorelei: You know, there's good stuff about \r\nthis life and there's bad stuff... Beth's life, I mean. Like, the good stuff \r\nis... Well, dinner tonight-- was that food scrumptious or what? (Laughs)",
        "Edmund: Finger-licking good, which I half \r\nexpected you to demonstrate the way you were salivating over it.",
        "Lorelei: And the china and the silver and the \r\ncrystal. Mmm... It was all so fancy. It was kind of like being royalty.",
        "Edmund: No, royalty is far better, trust me.",
        "Lorelei: Oh, that's right. 'Cause you are \r\nroyalty... Or were. (Laughs) got to laugh at yourself, Eddie. Hey, so, was your \r\npalace as big as this mansion?",
        "Edmund: This mansion is barely the size of my \r\npool house.",
        "Lorelei: Beth must have been pretty special, \r\nhuh? I mean, people sure seem to love her a lot.",
        "Edmund: There was a great deal about her to \r\nlove.",
        "Lorelei: Well, even though she was kind of \r\nuptight and boring?",
        "Edmund: Beth was a lady. For example, she \r\nknew which fork to use for salad, a skill you have yet to master.",
        "Lorelei: So, I used the wrong fork, so what? \r\nThey didn't notice. They're just so happy to have me alive. I could eat with my \r\nfeet and they wouldn't care.",
        "Edmund: There are only but so many times that \r\nyou have to slip up before we're caught. That's why we must keep drilling you. \r\nIn fact, I think we should go upstairs right now and do it on your etiquette \r\nbooks.",
        "Lorelei: Why are you so hard on me, huh? P's \r\nnot hard on me. Yeah, Phillip, that's right, Phillip, my charming, refined, \r\nsexy, rich husband. Phillip adores me.",
        "Edmund: Ex-husband, darling.",
        "Lorelei: Not the way he was looking at me \r\ntonight, darling.",
        "Edmund: I am your husband, Lorelei, as much \r\nas that frightens me, and you are my beloved Beth, my princess. You are \r\ncompletely devoted to me and that is the way you must think or this plan of ours \r\nwon't work out.",
        "Lorelei: See, that's funny, cause my mind's \r\nthinking in a different direction. I\u2019m figuring I\u2019m sitting here in hog heaven. \r\nEverybody thinks I\u2019m Beth. I\u2019m in, I did it. So remind me again: Why do I need \r\nyou?",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nRomeo: You sure know how to throw one heck of a party, Tony.",
        "Tony: Catalina planned it.",
        "Romeo: Well, either way, you're still \"da \r\nbomb.\"",
        "Tony: Yeah. I\u2019m \"da bomb,\" all right...",
        "Romeo: You are. Hey, you handled that Sam \r\nSpencer situation with total finesse. Marah thinks I\u2019m the one who exposed \r\nChavez and saved her dad, not Sam. And she's so mad at that guy; I don't think \r\nshe'll ever speak to him again. And we got rid of him just like Carlos wanted us \r\nto, without having to use this.",
        "Tony: You know what you just said? That was \r\nthe best thing that came out of tonight.",
        "Romeo: Not true, my friend. Now that Sam's \r\nout of the picture...",
        "Tony: You know what? Don't, Romeo. I know \r\nwhere you're going, don\u2019t.",
        "Romeo: But now that Sam's gone...",
        "Tony: Look, Romeo, Romeo, Romeo, put a lid on \r\nit, all right? You think... You think I jumped through hoops? You think I went \r\nthrough hell just so that Marah could come back to me?",
        "Romeo: Yep.",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nMarah: (Sobbing) Go away! I mean it, Sam-- go away!",
        "Sam: I feel terrible.",
        "Marah: You should. You lied to me. Said you \r\nwere responsible for clearing my dad when it was Tony all along.",
        "Sam: Yeah-- all along, Tony. I lied--to you; \r\nI lied to myself. I just didn't believe you were really mine. And I didn't want \r\nto lose you.",
        "Marah: Maybe if you had told the truth from \r\nthe beginning, you wouldn't have lost me.",
        "Sam: Marah, I don't believe that you think \r\nthat's true any more than I do. At the party, after I told you it was Tony, I \r\nsaw the way you looked at him. If he had given you just the smallest amount of \r\nencouragement, you would have run to his side in a heartbeat.",
        "Marah: But he didn't, did he?",
        "Sam: And that's what really bothers you. Not \r\nso much that I let you down, but that Tony...",
        "Marah: No. No, that bothers me. That bothers \r\nme, big time. I was going to give myself to you tonight. I was going to be with \r\nyou in a way that I\u2019ve never been with anybody else. And you betrayed me. I feel \r\nsick.",
        "Sam: One part of you does, yes. And I\u2019m \r\nresponsible for that sick feeling, and I will never forgive myself for that, but \r\nthere is another part of you-- a bigger part-- that's thinking, \"how could Tony \r\ndo something like this for me, and then turn his back on me?\" It's because he \r\nstill loves you. But he just can't admit it. And, Marah, I know... I know you \r\nstill love him, too. I saw the way the two of you danced together. It killed me. \r\nIt killed Catalina, too. You want to know why it killed me so bad? Because I \r\nknew right then in that moment-- finally, I got it through my thick skull-- that \r\nI can't compete with that. No one can compete with that. Sure, I could \r\nmanipulate you a thousand ways into loving me, but in the end it doesn't make a \r\ndamn bit of difference. And you know what?",
        "Marah: What?",
        "Sam: I know you may hate me for lying to you, \r\nbut I swear I hate myself even more, because that's not who I am. I\u2019m not the \r\nkind of person that tricks someone into loving them. You either love me or you \r\ndon't, and you don\u2019t. And that's okay. But you should be with the person that \r\nyou do love. You should go be with that person. You should go find Tony tonight. \r\nYou should go make things right with him. He's the one you should have been with \r\nall along.",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nTony: You think... You think I did all of this tonight just so that Marah would \r\ncome back to me?",
        "Romeo: Marah's no dummy, Tony. At some point \r\nshe's going to wonder why me-- me of all people came to her rescue.",
        "Tony: I told you to tell her it was business. \r\nYou meathead.",
        "Romeo: Yeah, and who do I work for? You. \r\nYou're just now realizing this?",
        "Tony: No. No, I\u2019m cool, all right? Sam is the \r\nonly one. The only other one that knew that I fixed that photo. And he would \r\nnever point Marah in that direction. Never. What?",
        "Romeo: There are a million ways you could've \r\nhandled this Sam situation, but you chose the one way-- the one way-- that might \r\nbring Marah back to you. Open your eyes, man. You've got it so bad for this \r\nchick it's like a disease.",
        "Tony: Would you go pay the stupid caterer? \r\nGo! Get the hell out of here! Go!",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nBuzz: I mean, can you believe Harley? She has one kid in the car, one kid in \r\njail. Zach's the one that had the sense to be born in the hospital. Blake and \r\nClarissa, you know?",
        "Holly: In a cabin in the middle of a storm.",
        "Buzz: What about Ross and Blake? I mean, you \r\nknow, they were supposed to tie the knot. It was supposed to be a surprise \r\nparty. He was going to propose, what happened?",
        "Holly: Yeah. Yeah, I remember.",
        "Buzz: What? It fizzled out?",
        "Holly: He got busy with Danny\u2019s trial and now \r\nhe's teaching at the university.",
        "Buzz: Well, that's why he's got an assistant, \r\nso he can spend time with Blake and the kids, right?",
        "Holly: Yeah. That's what I thought.",
        "Buzz: Well, this... What, Tory?",
        "Holly: Mm-hmm.",
        "Buzz: She's a help, right?",
        "Holly: Oh, yeah, she's a lot of help. She's \r\nprobably too much help.",
        "Buzz: Meaning?",
        "Holly: Meaning she has a \"thing\" for Ross.",
        "Buzz: A \"thing\"?",
        "Holly: Oh, yeah.",
        "Buzz: Like... Like, like a father fixation?",
        "Holly: \"Like... Like,\" she admires him and \r\nshe tells him how profound and how brilliant and how witty he is-- and on and on \r\nand on.",
        "Buzz: Will she work for me? Oh, you are \r\nconcerned.",
        "Holly: I think Ross is at a stage in his life \r\nwhere he could be vulnerable to her charms.",
        "Buzz: What charms? She's no competition for \r\nBlake, come on! I mean, she\u2019s... Ross adores... He worships... She's the center \r\nof the... Enough with the kids. Come on. Let's dance.",
        "Holly: Oh, I thought you'd never ask me \r\nagain.",
        "Buzz: This is going to be nice. I know this \r\nis going to be nicer.",
        "Rick: Hey, grandpa Buzz.",
        "Harley: Hi. The baby wouldn't sleep-- do you \r\nmind if we barge in?",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nEdmund: There is so much you still don't know about Beth it's frightening.",
        "Lorelei: Yeah, well, whatever's left I can \r\nwing it.",
        "Edmund: No. You can't wing names you've never \r\nheard, nor faces you've never seen, or facts. For example, Rick Bauer. Hmm? Your \r\nchum since high school? What's his father's name, and where is his father right \r\nnow?",
        "Lorelei: Well, that's not fair, you never \r\ntold me that.",
        "Edmund: Yes, well, try using that one on \r\nRick. I\u2019m sure he'd get a kick out of it, and there's one other thing you can't \r\nwing, darling-- Beth's innate sophistication, her grace and her style. You may \r\nhave changed your hair and make-up and clothes to look like Beth, you may even \r\nbe able to copy the way she walks and talks, but when it comes to the really \r\nimportant things, you're as far from Beth as they come.",
        "Phillip: Would you care to repeat that? What \r\ndid I just hear you say?",
        "Edmund: Beth and I were just talking about \r\nthe terrible headaches she's been getting since the accident. They make her so \r\nwithdrawn; she's almost a completely different person, barely recognizable.",
        "Phillip: Do you have a headache right now?",
        "Lorelei: Just a teeny one.",
        "Phillip: Well, that's funny; you certainly \r\nseemed fine at dinner.",
        "Edmund: Oh, they come out of nowhere and \r\nvanish just as quickly. As a matter of fact, you had a bit of a memory lapse \r\nearlier, didn't you?",
        "Lorelei: Yes. For a moment, I forgot your \r\nname.",
        "Phillip: If only.",
        "Lorelei: You know, before this headache gets \r\nany worse, I should really take one of my pills. Would you get them for me, \r\nEdmund?",
        "Edmund: They're very strong, darling. The \r\ndoctor said you shouldn't take them unless absolutely necessary.",
        "Lorelei: Well, I know, but I just want them \r\nwith me just in case. They're upstairs on my nightstand.",
        "Edmund: Of course.",
        "Lorelei: And while you're going, could you \r\nfix me a roast beef sandwich?",
        "Edmund: Are you sure you're still hungry, \r\nBeth? You just had dinner.",
        "Lorelei: Well, I\u2019m supposed to take the \r\nmedication with food, remember?",
        "Edmund: Quite right.",
        "Lorelei: Russian dressing on the roast beef \r\nwould be great.",
        "Phillip: I thought you hated Russian \r\ndressing?",
        "Lorelei: Well, that's really kind of a funny \r\nthing because, well, what happened was when I was in the hospital in Mexico, one \r\nof the nurses put Russian dressing on everything, and I just developed a taste \r\nfor it.",
        "Phillip: You want to put a little Russian \r\ndressing on that, Edmund? Wow.",
        "Lorelei: Wow?",
        "Phillip: Wow. It's good to have you here. \r\nHome.",
        "Lorelei: Yeah? Well, it is... It's really \r\ngood to be home... With you-- and the kids and mom, too.",
        "Phillip: Right. Okay, well, I\u2019m going to hit \r\nthe hay. You enjoy that sandwich.",
        "Lorelei: Well, you know, it's early yet. It's \r\nreally early. We could play a game of five- card stud.",
        "Phillip: Now you're playing poker?",
        "Lorelei: I learned in the hospital.",
        "Phillip: You learned-- from the missionaries?",
        "Lorelei: Well, we had to do something to pass \r\nthe time. You know. But if you don't want to play poker, we could play something \r\nmore time like gin rummy or casino or go fish.",
        "Phillip: No. No, I\u2019d love to play some poker. \r\nThat would be... A penny a point.",
        "Lorelei: Whatever floats your boat.",
        "Phillip: Whatever floats my boat. Okay. \r\nYou're kind of full of yourself tonight. I\u2019m not... I\u2019m not... I\u2019m not sure \r\nexactly what it is that's gotten into you, but I think I kind of like it.",
        "Lorelei: Yeah?",
        "Phillip: Yeah.",
        "Lorelei: Cut the deck.",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nTony: Hey.",
        "Catalina: Hey.",
        "Tony: What are you doing here?",
        "Catalina: I don't know.",
        "Tony: Catalina?",
        "Catalina: I wanted to help clean... That's \r\nnot true. I guess I just didn't want the night to end.",
        "Tony: Yeah. Some night all right. You know \r\nyou did an awesome job. You know that, right? I mean, everybody had a great...",
        "Catalina: Sam and Marah broke up.",
        "Tony: I don't know if they broke up, they had \r\na fight...",
        "Catalina: They're history, Tony. She's free. \r\nSo if you want her back...",
        "Tony: Why would I want her back?",
        "Catalina: I don't know. She hurt you time and \r\ntime again. She never appreciated you. But, if you want her, then now is your \r\nchance.",
        "Tony: Catalina, I don't... I don't know why \r\nyou're talking about this, but let's please not.",
        "Catalina: You know, I wonder if Marah ever \r\nreally knew you. Could she, when you two come from such different worlds? She \r\ndoesn't know the fire in your soul, how brave and loyal you are... She doesn't \r\nknow that the heart that beats here is generous and kind... That your eyes, they \r\nsee so much. They understand so much. That you're so strong. That when you kiss, \r\nit's so tender.",
        "Tony: Cat...",
        "Catalina: She doesn't know, but I do.",
        "Tony: I think you see more in me than what's \r\nthere, all right? I\u2019m not some hero, okay?",
        "Catalina: Yes, you are. You're my hero.",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nSam: Marah, think of all the things Tony's done for you, when his pride was \r\nsupposedly so hurt that he didn't care about you anymore. He came down to San \r\nCristobel after you, he saved your dad's career. He even invited you to his \r\nbirthday party.",
        "Marah: Stop.",
        "Sam: Why don't you want to hear this?",
        "Marah: Because even if he does care about me, \r\nthere's no way he would let me back into his life.",
        "Sam: You're never going to know that unless \r\nyou try. You know that. Unless you think he loves Catalina now. Is that it? You \r\nthink he's chosen her over you or something?",
        "Marah: All I know is that I can't take any \r\nmore rejection right now-- or heartache.",
        "Sam: Join the club.",
        "Marah: I\u2019m so sorry.",
        "Sam: So am I. Go to him. Marah, go find Tony.",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nHarley: Have you ever seen Rick look happier?",
        "Buzz: I can't say as I have. How are you two \r\ndoing, besides exhausted?",
        "Harley: I asked Rick to marry me.",
        "Buzz: Okay.",
        "Harley: Well, he asked me when he first found \r\nout I was pregnant.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, Frank told me.",
        "Harley: And I said no.",
        "Buzz: And now you've reconsidered. You don't \r\nlove him.",
        "Harley: Where has passion ever gotten me? \r\nWhere has it ever gotten either one of us?",
        "Buzz: But along the way...",
        "Harley: No, no, no. Dad, dad, dad-- Rick and \r\nI are great friends; we'll be great partners and great parents, and that's what \r\nI want for Jude. I want that for all my kids. I want some stability. I just want \r\nsome stability. Can you please be happy for me, please?",
        "Buzz: I will, okay. I\u2019ll be happy for you. If \r\nbeing married to Rick will make you happy, then who am I to say otherwise?",
        "Harley: Oh, thank you.",
        "Buzz: I\u2019ll even cater it if you want. Are you \r\nsure?",
        "Harley: Well, he hasn't officially said yes \r\nyet, so...",
        "Buzz: He turned down my daughter?",
        "Harley: No. No, he hasn't turned me down, but \r\nthis is a big step, he wants to sleep on it. Not that we're actually sleeping.",
        "Buzz: I can't do this.",
        "Harley: Can't do what?",
        "Buzz: Outside. We've got to get some air. \r\nLook, he's a great guy. He's a great guy, all right? But you don't love him.",
        "Harley: Yes, I do.",
        "Buzz: Not the way, you know, like you love \r\nsomebody who wants you to marry them. Not the way I loved Jenna, not the way-- \r\nGod help us-- you loved Phillip.",
        "Harley: Oh, see, where did all that love get \r\nme?",
        "Buzz: Oh, come on. I mean, you're \r\nrationalizing into doing something wrong.",
        "Harley: I\u2019m not rationalizing. I am trying to \r\nmake a good choice here, dad. I\u2019m trying to use my heart and my head.",
        "Buzz: Is this what he wants?",
        "Harley: He asked me first.",
        "Buzz: But now he wants to think about it.",
        "Harley: Well, it's a big step.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, absolutely, it's a big step, so \r\nwhy don't you... Don't rush into it. Think about it for a few weeks.",
        "Harley: Please, can't you just support me? Do \r\nyou have to do this?",
        "Buzz: I am supporting you. I love you, I \r\nadore you, I want to see you be happy. I don't want you to sell yourself short, \r\nyou know? I mean, you need romance, you know, passion. You think you can live \r\nwithout those things, but you can't, because you know that's just... It's not \r\nliving. Come on inside.",
        "Harley: I\u2019ll be in a minute.",
        "Gus: You know, for once in his life, I think \r\nyour father's right.",
        "Harley: Not again. The place is closed for \r\nfamily.",
        "Gus: I\u2019m family. I\u2019m family... At least an \r\nhonorary uncle or something, right? Hey, hey, hey, pally. How's Trix?",
        "Harley: Don't breathe on him; we're trying to \r\nget him to sleep.",
        "Gus: Yeah, well, no wonder he can't sleep. He \r\nsenses all of the tension in the room. May I?",
        "Harley: You know, I\u2019ve actually had \r\nexperience.",
        "Gus: Yeah, well, so have I. I brought the kid \r\ninto the world, you know? Hey. Hey. Ah, yeah, I think he recognizes me. Can I? \r\nMay I? Thanks. Hey there, buddy. Don't cry. Oh, don't start. (Baby cries) my \r\nturn. That's all right. There you go. There you go. You've had a stressful day, \r\nI know. I know it's been a hard day, it's tough. It's tough being born, \r\nactually, isn't it? It's very intense. A little bedtime story, maybe? A little \r\nbedtime story, or maybe, or actually more of a poem-- something my father used \r\nto tell me. You ready? You ready? \"There was an ease to Casey\u2019s manner as he \r\nstepped into his place. There was a pride in Casey\u2019s bearing and a smile on \r\nCasey\u2019s face. And when responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat. No \r\nstranger in that crowd could doubt that Casey was at bat...\"",
        "Harley: Rick.",
        "Rick: I just want my kid back. I want my son \r\nback.",

        "\r\nLorelei: (Laughs)",
        "Phillip: Another full house? How did these \r\nmissionaries teach you? Give me these cards. It's my deal. Ridiculous.",
        "Lorelei: You know, Phillip, before we went \r\nout to dinner, you mentioned something about my inheritance.",
        "Phillip: Yeah, what about it?",
        "Lorelei: Well, that conversation we were \r\nhaving about Lizzie just made me start thinking about future generations and \r\npassing things down, so I\u2019m just wondering: What's the status of all that?",
        "Phillip: Are you talking about what you got \r\nfrom Bradley? Is that what you're talking about?",
        "Lorelei: What?",
        "Phillip: I\u2019m not sure I understand why you're \r\nasking me this. Edmund was not able to steal it from you down in Mexico, if \r\nthat's what you mean. That's not what you mean. What do you mean?",
        "Lorelei: Well, Phillip, you know that I rely \r\non your judgment in these matters.",
        "Phillip: Well, I think you ought to dump him. \r\nOh, you mean the bequest.",
        "Lorelei: Are there papers that I need to sign \r\nor file to claim what's mine?",
        "Phillip: I thought you said you didn't want \r\nit. That's what you said before you left. I mean, besides, given the source, I \r\nthink we both know what it's probably worth.",
        "Lorelei: How much? I mean, I can't remember \r\nthings and I have these silly blackouts, so I need you to tell me things.",

        "Phillip: Yeah. Yeah. As a matter of fact, we \r\nwere. It was... It was a lot of fun, very enlightening. But I have to say \r\ngoodnight. Got to go through a few files before I hit the hay. Going to see \r\nLizzie off to school in the morning?",

        "Edmund: Yes, and you seem to be returning the \r\nsentiment. Well, I think it's time you start behaving like my wife, and I think \r\nit's time that Phillip finds out just how much we adore each other.",
