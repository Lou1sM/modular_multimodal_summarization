        "On Sebastian's yacht, he has dinner and drinks for Holly, Michelle, and a suspicious Tony. He drugs Michelle and Tony's wine so they fall asleep. He tells Holly that Roger had something else planned for her and that they must leave now. When Michelle and Tony wake up, they find a note saying that they must bring Ed Bauer to him or Holly will never be returned. Danny tells Rick how angry he is at Michelle for her recent behavior. Josh threatens Sandy, knocks him around, and tells him to leave town. Cassie and Tammy argue about J.B; Cassie tells her that he's her cousin and was just using her to get back at Reva. Tammy doesn't believe it at first but then can't believe how evil he is and how stupid she was. Cassie consoles her, but Tammy says she will never fall in love again. Tammy visits Sandy's hospital room as he is about to leave and punches him in the stomach. Jonathan and Reva have a big confrontation at her house. They argue and she tries to reason with him, and other tactics. He is obviously feeling vulnerable as well as angry and in pain, so she tries to be honest and reach out to him, which ends with his hands on her throat."

        "Danny: Rick?",
        "Rick: Yeah, what is it?",
        "Danny: You got a second?",
        "Rick: Danny, I'm really busy today. What can I do for you? What's up? Can you take care of that for me?",
        "Nurse: Sure.",
        "Danny: Well, I just dropped Robbie off at daycare. I was wondering how you felt about him coming over for a sleep-over tonight.",
        "Rick: Sure. Jude loves the company. What's going on? Are you going out of town?",
        "Danny: No. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't, because Michelle is the one who's gone out of town and... (sighs) look, the way I feel about it tonight, I just think it's best that Robbie's not around me. I don't know if I can trust myself to keep from saying some really nasty things about his mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: A little air before dinner?",
        "Michelle: Dinner? I didn't realize it was that late already. I guess I was letting my mind drift a little.",
        "Holly: Toward what?",
        "Michelle: Oh, you know, what I'm going to find on this trip. My mother. Me.",
        "Holly: Well, we're both in the same boat.",
        "Michelle: That's weak. (Laughs)",
        "Holly: Yeah.",
        "Michelle: So, what's your take on Sebastian?",
        "Holly: Well, at first I was skeptical. And then I found out he was Roger's son. Uh... it's all a little strange, especially when he reminds me of Roger.",
        "Michelle: You know, you didn't answer my question. What do you think of him?",
        "Holly: Determined. He's very determined to fulfill his father's last wishes. I just hope he gets on with it. I want to get on with my life.",
        "Michelle: Huh. I've been saying that for the last couple months. I think getting on with your life is what you do while you're already living it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: I need a water taxi. No, not that big. You know what I mean. Call me when you've got it handled.",
        "Tony: You going somewhere?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: So, did you just think that you would get away with it forever? Is that it?",
        "Sandy: Josh, I'm sorry.",
        "Josh: No, don't do that. Don't even say that. You could not possibly begin to make up for what you owe to this family even if you lived another ten lifetimes, Sandy.",
        "Sandy: I know I lied, and I deceived everyone.",
        "Josh: Sandy, you are a waste of my time. Now, for some reason, Reva decided to save your life to give you a second chance. I suggest you use that second chance well, because you sure as hell didn't deserve it.",
        "Sandy: I know. But right now we have to go out and get Jonathan. You don't know what he's capable of.",
        "Josh: I will handle whatever Jonathan has in mind after I'm finished with you.",
        "Sandy: What do you mean?",
        "Josh: Get out of town, Sandy. Get away from my family. Never come back. And I don't mean eventually or at your convenience. I want you gone right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I know what's coming. You're going to tell me all the reasons why I shouldn't be with JB. Well, you know what? I don't want to hear it.",
        "Cassie: You can't see him, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: (Laughs) I didn't see that one coming.",
        "Cassie: Tammy, please.",
        "Tammy: Why? That's what you haven't said. First you send Edmund to try and scare him off, and since that hasn't worked, now you're going to do a number on me. I like JB, Mom. What is the big deal? I might even love...",
        "Cassie: No. No. You can't love him. You can't ever love him. And you can never be with him again.",
        "Tammy: Because you don't approve. I'm old enough to love someone. I'm old enough to be with someone. It's my choice.",
        "Cassie: Tammy, I would support almost any man who wanted to be with you, as long as he was kind to you and he was someone who deserved you.",
        "Tammy: And JB's not that person?",
        "Cassie: No.",
        "Tammy: Why not?",
        "Cassie: Because he's...",
        "Tammy: Why?",
        "Cassie: Because...",
        "Tammy: Why, Mom?",
        "Cassie: Because he's your cousin, Tammy!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Hey, Mom. I hear you've been looking for me? It's about damn time.",
        "Reva: Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: In the flesh. In all my glory. (Sighs) Rafting trips. The Thanksgiving table. Looks like good times were had by all.",
        "Reva: Except by you. Is that what you were going to say next?",
        "Jonathan: No. No. That would be too obvious.",
        "Reva: Give me that.",
        "Jonathan: Whoa, whoa. What's the matter? You afraid I'm going to get it all dirty and smudgy? Defile something precious to you, like I did with Tammy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: Can I help you?",
        "Tony: I doubt it, man. What's the water taxi for, huh?",
        "Sebastian: This boat is too big to put into port, so we need a smaller one.",
        "Tony: Really?",
        "Sebastian: Mm-hmm.",
        "Tony: Sounds like you need it right away.",
        "Sebastian: I like to plan ahead. Well, I was just about ready to send a search party out for you. You know, if you fall overboard out here, you're pretty much good as gone. (Weak laughter) all right, well, dinner's ready. Anybody up for a cocktail to take the edge off?",
        "Holly: I don't drink.",
        "Sebastian: That's right. Well, in the case, sparkling water for Holly and wine for the rest of us, yes?",
        "Michelle: So, what are you guys talking about? Seems like the testosterone is a little thick.",
        "Sebastian: Just marking our territory.",
        "Tony: Yeah, we were just getting acquainted.",
        "Sebastian: This is a vintage Lafitte '57. It's very good.",
        "Holly: Roger's favorite. Are you going to do that?",
        "Sebastian: What?",
        "Holly: Come up with Roger's greatest hits--wine, cars, cologne, music, vacation spots, favorite colors?",
        "Sebastian: I wasn't aware I was doing that.",
        "Tony: Listen, man, you got tequila? I'm not really the vino type.",
        "Sebastian: Don't worry, Tony. It doesn't take the most sophisticated palate to enjoy this vintage.",
        "Tony: I guess you put me in my place, didn't you? So, hey, what are we drinking to? You, your yacht, what?",
        "Sebastian: Let's drink to Roger, to adventure, and to the hope that everyone gets what they wish for on this trip.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Why are you surprised? Did you think I would understand? Did you think I would trust you?",
        "Sandy: I didn't mean for things to end up this way.",
        "Josh: (Laughs) I am way beyond believing that, Sandy.",
        "Sandy: Josh, I know Reva is...",
        "Josh: Don't you dare. I am not your ally. In fact, I am sick and tired of people like you--liars and fakes, people who fool themselves into believing that what they're doing is the right thing and then all they do is cause devastation. But I'll tell you something, I don't even think that you were fooling yourself. I think you did exactly what you wanted to do.",
        "Sandy: That is not true.",
        "Josh: You don't understand the truth. You don't care about the truth. You lied --by choice--every step of the way, Sandy. And you're not going to get away with it.",
        "Sandy: What are you going to do? Put a contract out on me? I really don't care anymore, man. All that matters right now is Jonathan and what he can do to you and Reva, what he wants to do to your whole family.",
        "Josh: You see, I don't think Jonathan would even be on this rampage if it wasn't for you.",
        "Sandy: No. He would have come.",
        "Josh: You don't know that. Do you think he'd be as angry as he is right now if it weren't for the fact that you stole his life?",
        "Sandy: Maybe not. But...",
        "Josh: Sandy? I think you're misunderstanding me, here. Jonathan may be a threat to this family, but that doesn't change the fact that you are also a threat to this family. Now, I'm not playing favorites between the two of you. I am talking to you now because you're the one that's standing in front of me. You understand?",
        "Sandy: Josh, you have to know that I love Reva.",
        "Josh: Don't.",
        "Sandy: I love your...",
        "Josh: Do not even say that to me.",
        "Sandy: (Grunts)",
        "Josh: After what you did to this family, what you did to Reva, what could you possibly understand about love, other than how to destroy it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I wondered if you'd be too much of a coward to admit what you did to Tammy.",
        "Jonathan: Coward? I'd take an ad out in the newspaper if I could. Can you see that headline? \"Kissing cousins consummate.\"",
        "Reva: Shut your mouth. I won't let you talk about what you did to her with such...",
        "Jonathan: Pride?",
        "Reva: What is wrong with you?",
        "Jonathan: Well, that's a good question, Mom. I'm afraid it's just not a short answer.",
        "Reva: So, this is where you're going to say you're the victim?",
        "Jonathan: Come on, where's the nurturing, Reva? I'm your son. Where's the love?",
        "Reva: You're...",
        "Jonathan: Sick? Sick? Offensive? You want to know what I find offensive? That you can stand here and act like this type of behavior is completely foreign to you. I have to break it to you. You're no saint. I know what you've done with your life.",
        "Reva: A lot of things that I'm not very proud of, but I never deliberately set out to hurt anyone.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, you have a conscience. That's good for you. Me? No, guilt just gets in the way. I like things simpler. I have always wanted to hurt you more than you've hurt me. So, how am I doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I'm sorry.",
        "Tammy: JB...",
        "Cassie: JB isn't his name, honey. It's not.",
        "Tammy: Be quiet, Mom, for a minute. I need to think. You're not letting me think!",
        "Cassie: I'm sorry. I'm sorry I blurted it out like that. I didn't mean to tell you like that.",
        "Tammy: You're sorry? I don't... this doesn't make any sense.",
        "Cassie: Sandy isn't Reva's son. JB is Jonathan.",
        "Tammy: This isn't happening. You're making this up.",
        "Cassie: Look...",
        "Tammy: Things like this don't happen in real life. In a normal life.",
        "Cassie: I don't want you to worry about Jonathan.",
        "Tammy: JB.",
        "Cassie: His name is Jonathan, Tammy. He is Reva's true son, and he is your cousin and his name's Jonathan.",
        "Tammy: Stop calling him Jonathan. It's JB.",
        "Cassie: I'm so sorry. I am so sorry. And I know this is so hard for you to handle right now. It's so too much to handle. JB was a name Jonathan used just to get close to you.",
        "Tammy: We are close.",
        "Cassie: You know I'm telling you the truth, honey. I am telling you the truth. Tammy? Tammy? Tammy?",
        "Tammy: The truth is that you would do anything to keep me away from JB!",
        "Cassie: No.",
        "Tammy: Because you think that just because I lost my virginity, I'm going to become the kind of super-slut that you were. Well, you'd do anything, including this crazy, twisted lie! Well, I'm not you, Mom! I won't believe you. (Sobbing)",
        "Cassie: (Crying) I'm so sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: Despite my continuing reservations, I feel I want to thank you for your persistence in getting me to come along on this--what are we calling it-- fool's errand?",
        "Sebastian: (Laughs)",
        "Holly: A dying man's last wish?",
        "Sebastian: Let's just call it the final piece of the puzzle in the life that was Roger Thorpe. And he would be so happy to see you along for the ride.",
        "Michelle: I'll drink to that.",
        "Sebastian: You relate?",
        "Michelle: Well, let's just say since my accident, I've been doing a little searching.",
        "Holly: For your memory?",
        "Michelle: Not just my memory but... well, part of the reason I decided to come along was the feeling that I get when I remember my mom. It's a really warm and loving force.",
        "Holly: She was not only warm and loving, she was very brave. Like you.",
        "Michelle: So now I really feel like I'm missing something. So I figure, what do I have to lose?",
        "Sebastian: And I'll drink to that. What do any of us have to lose?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: No, I don't know where Michelle went. She just took off. The other day I was in New York, she called me because she had a memory.",
        "Rick: What kind of memory did she have?",
        "Danny: Of Maureen.",
        "Rick: Really?",
        "Danny: Yeah, and it was great. She was excited, and for the first time in I don't know how long, she seemed...",
        "Rick: Did she seem like her old self again?",
        "Danny: Yes, she did, and she said that she wanted to get her memory back. So I went and found this specialist in New York, and he is the first person who had an explanation for all the changes in Michelle's behavior--her mood swings and her temper--and he is totally convinced that it has everything to do with the damage that she had to her front lobe.",
        "Rick: Well, wait a second. Did this doctor discuss treatment options with you?",
        "Danny: Yeah. It's experimental stuff. But I got back here, and I told Michelle about it, and she flipped out on me and thought that I thought that she was damaged or something...",
        "Rick: Do you feel that way?",
        "Danny: It doesn't matter. The point is, she took off.",
        "Rick: Just took off? What do you mean, \"took off\"? Where did she go?",
        "Danny: Yeah, with my idiot cousin, who apparently thinks she's fine just the way she is.",
        "Rick: Damaged, right?",
        "Danny: Well, Rick, do you think she's fine the way she is?",
        "Rick: No, I don't think she's fine, but whether or not it's psychological or medical, I can't say, Danny.",
        "Danny: Right, well, look, I am sick of trying to rationalize or explain away all of Michelle's behavior. I am. And the way I feel tonight, I just think it's best that Robbie be with you guys, because I just... I don't know if I can keep myself from saying some really terrible things about his mother.",
        "Rick: You certainly don't mind saying those things in front of her brother, do you, Danny?",
        "Danny: Well, Rick, you're not a three-year-old. I thought you could handle something like that.",
        "Rick: I doubt that Michelle is going to want to talk to me about this, Danny, but believe it or not, I'm on your side. I mean, let's face it, she's my sister, but we don't know who she is right now. And what's worse is I love my sister to death, Danny, but I really don't like who she is right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Well, I may be hoping for something that I'm not going to find, but if I can just be one ounce better to Robbie or to Danny and just get some part of my life on track...",
        "Holly: I can understand that all too well.",
        "Sebastian: Here we all are, guided by our pasts and looking for something to inform our futures.",
        "Tony: Uh-uh. Uh-uh, not me. I'm along for the ride.",
        "Sebastian: Don't be so sure, Tony. You never know what can happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Do you really love this family, Sandy? Hm?",
        "Sandy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Josh: Is that why you stayed in town so long pretending to be Reva's son? Tell me something: How is it possible that you could so devastate the people you claim to love? And how is it possible that you can justify the risk that Reva took for you? She could have died on that table trying to save your miserable life.",
        "Sandy: I would have stopped her if I could have.",
        "Josh: You couldn't have. You know why? Because the minute you showed up in town and claimed to be Reva's son, she was ready to die for you!",
        "Sandy: (Panicked breathing)",
        "Josh: I don't know why I even have to tell you to leave town. I don't know why you're not just running in shame. I don't know what a person like you could possibly understand about love, but if you really love Reva, you'll leave town.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: You're just upset because I'm not your little girl anymore, and you can't control me.",
        "Cassie: Oh, baby, you know that's not true. I want you to find love, Tammy, but this isn't it. And I know what you think you're feeling, but it's...",
        "Tammy: Whatever I'm feeling right now, it's what I'm feeling. And it's strong, and it makes me want to fight for JB. It makes me want to fight for myself, even if... even if you're not lying.",
        "Cassie: You know that I am telling you the truth about this boy.",
        "Tammy: I don't want to be so stupid. I don't want my first time to be like this. It doesn't make any sense. I'm nobody. I'm just a girl who thought she was... I didn't do anything to him. Maybe... maybe he didn't know who I am.",
        "Cassie: He knew. He knows who Reva is. He knows who we all are. He came to town to make Reva pay for abandoning him and believing Sandy, honey. Honey, this wasn't about you. You were just... you were just some...",
        "Tammy: Piece of meat for some sick, sick... (sobs) I am so stupid.",
        "Cassie: No, you're not stupid. You are a sweet, sweet angel, honey. Yes, you are.",
        "Tammy: No. Not anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: You want to hurt me? You did. I'm filled with all kinds of pain. But what you did to Tammy, a complete innocent...",
        "Jonathan: Not anymore.",
        "Reva: I am barely containing this impulse that I have to smack you down and keep you down.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, well, that would be a nifty way to show your love: Knock my lights out. Where's the sympathy? Where's the crushing guilt you're supposed to be feeling?",
        "Reva: I am filled with so much guilt about leaving you behind. But if you're trying to beat me, you did. You won. You're the monster now.",
        "Jonathan: Oh. You see, what I'm trying to wrap my mind around--this guy comes into town, someone you've never met, and claims to be me. You welcome him into your home, your heart. You never even try to confirm his story.",
        "Reva: I trusted he was my son. Maybe because I wanted to believe it.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, maybe because he was cute and harmless and oh- so-caring? The kind of son any mother would want.",
        "Reva: I would have wanted you, too.",
        "Jonathan: Liar. Liar. As far as you're concerned, I'm the enemy.",
        "Reva: Okay, but what you did to Tammy was unspeakable. So, what? Now you want sympathy? Is that what this is? (Laughs)... oh, my God. I know what you're doing. You're jealous of Sandy because we loved him. You want back what he took from you. I know what you want. You want this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Wow, that was delicious. All the wine made me sleepy, though.",
        "Tony: You only had one glass, you know.",
        "Michelle: You're not looking too sharp there, yourself, spunky.",
        "Tony: Hey, hey, hey. Just getting my sea legs, that's all.",
        "Michelle: Mm-hmm.",
        "Holly: I think we're all a little jet-lagged.",
        "Sebastian: Your staterooms are downstairs. Feel free.",
        "Michelle: Do you think it would be rude if we just stayed at the table? (Laughter)",
        "Sebastian: Not at all, Michelle. We're all friends here.",
        "Tony: It's okay. I'll keep you company. I'm a good conversationalist, right?",
        "Michelle: Oh, yeah? Since when?",
        "Sebastian: Well, I am thinking of having an aperitif up on deck. Would you like to join me?",
        "Holly: Thank you, but I think I'll call it a night.",
        "Sebastian: Okay, then, tomorrow. Bright and early.",
        "Holly: Good night.",
        "Tony: G'night.",
        "Sebastian: Well, I guess I was a little heavy-handed. You shouldn't drink so much next time. Sweet dreams.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: (Panicked breathing)",
        "Nurse: So, how are we feeling, Sandy? You gave us quite a scare when you left the hospital.",
        "Sandy: The other time I left, I didn't get authorization. Is there someone I need to talk to? Because I'm going to get out of here.",
        "Nurse: You're still weak. There's still a chance of rejection.",
        "Sandy: Just tell me. I'm checking out of this town, and I'm checking out of here. For good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I Don't understand. How can someone have so much hate in their heart? He knew how I felt. He knew what I was feeling when he... oh, I'm so stupid.",
        "Cassie: No. No. No, you aren't. I'm not going to let you blame yourself. You were lied to. And you were manipulated by someone who knew all the right buttons to push.",
        "Tammy: I can never love anyone again. I can never be with anyone. I can never believe anyone.",
        "Cassie: Yes, you can. Yes, you can. We are going to get through this. We're going to figure out a way to handle this, and I promise you that one day someone's going to come along and you're going to have no choice to believe in them. And that person will never let you down.",
        "Tammy: No. I will let myself down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Do you think that I want anything from you? Huh? My picture in the photo album? On the family Christmas cards, grinning like an idiot?",
        "Reva: There's so much pain in your anger because you've gone to so much trouble to hurt us as deeply as you can.",
        "Jonathan: I haven't even started yet. You think what I did to Tammy was bad? You ain't seen nothing.",
        "Reva: You got away with lying to Tammy and doing what you did, but you won't rub our noses in it. I won't permit that.",
        "Jonathan: \"Permit\"? What, are you going to act like my mother, now?",
        "Reva: What did you do, come here to prove that you could be evil? That you could be despicable, that you could hurt us? Well, you did. So, now what?",
        "Jonathan: How much more can you stand?",
        "Reva: How much more can you stand? Can you stand being a human being?! Can you stand trying to fix the damage that you've done? Can you stand being strong enough to let me...",
        "Jonathan: Let you what?! Let you what?! Fix it?! This isn't our \"Dr. Phil\" moment, Reva! I'm not here to be psychoanalyzed!",
        "Reva: No, but you want something. So, if you want something from me, then speak up because I am so sick of this game! Tell me the truth. Tell me what you want!",
        "Jonathan: Or what?",
        "Reva: You say you know me? You're too much of a fool to know the truth that you should be scared to death of me.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, no. You really don't get it, lady. I am still standing here. I survived. You don't know what I've been through. I've cheated death.",
        "Reva: So have I. So have I. More times and in more ways than you can even imagine. You're here to challenge me? Let me see what you got.",

        "Holly: I wanted to thank you for the dinner. It was very nice.",
        "Sebastian: You're welcome. Holly, I've been waiting to tell you something away from Michelle and Tony. Roger, his plans weren't the same for everyone. He had something very special in mind for you.",
        "Holly: Hm, imagine my surprise.",
        "Sebastian: Well, we have to leave. Now.",
        "Holly: Now? In the dead of night?",
        "Sebastian: Roger was adamant that I take only you on this part of the journey.",

        "Josh: Danny.",
        "Danny: Josh.",
        "Josh: Uh, sorry to bother you. I'm just looking for somebody, thought you might have seen him. It's a young guy. He's been hanging out with Tammy. I don't know what he looks like, but he's going by the name of JB.",
        "Danny: Sorry, can't help you. Don't hang out with teenagers.",
        "Josh: Yeah, I just really need to find this guy, you know what I mean?",
        "Danny: Why? What'd he do?",
        "Josh: Well, I can't talk about that right now, but I need to get to him before he gets to... you know what? Forget about it. I'm really sorry I bothered you.",
        "Danny: Hey, Josh? You want some advice?",
        "Josh: No, I don't think I do.",
        "Danny: Okay, okay. You just look like you're about to make a bad decision about something.",
        "Josh: Bad for someone, yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: I'll tell you what I don't want: To open up my broken, little heart and cry in mommy's apron just so you can swoop in and right all the injustices in my world.",
        "Reva: All the wrongs that happened to you started with me. Why wouldn't I want to try to fix it?",
        "Jonathan: Because I'm not interested in making things easy for you, giving you a way to work off your guilt.",
        "Reva: You want my life to be harder?",
        "Jonathan: And more painful, yes.",
        "Reva: Then why are you still here? You've already caused so much pain. You destroyed Tammy's life. You rub my nose in what I did to you as a child. But I won't let you lay one hand on Marah or Shayne or Dylan. So, what's next? There's nothing left for you here. Is there?",
        "Jonathan: You're playing games with me again, Reva, and I'm not buying whatever it is you're selling.",
        "Reva: Well, you still haven't explained why you're still here, Jonathan. You don't want me to love you? Fine, I won't. So get out. We're done here. Is that what you want?",

        "Michelle: Where are they? Holly? Sebastian? Oh.",
        "Tony: All right, Michelle, this is not good. I told you this wasn't good. Didn't I say that to you? Oh, my God, my head.",
        "Michelle: Oh, my God.",

        "Cassie: Edmund, she's destroyed. She's a mess. I don't know if she wants to talk to anybody right now. I mean, I'll ask her. Maybe hearing your voice is going to make her feel better. Tammy? Tammy? Edmund, she's gone. I don't know. Tammy! Tammy! Tammy!",

        "Reva: Well? What do you want?",
        "Jonathan: I haven't decided yet.",
        "Reva: I think you're not leaving because you can't. And my guilt is my problem, and it's a big one. I don't know what to do with it, I never have. I still can barely even live with it.",
        "Jonathan: And seeing me, does it make it worse or better?",
        "Reva: A little of both. I'm glad you're alive. And the rest of what you've become, I'd like to fix if you'd let me try.",
        "Jonathan: That is so typical. You know what? I don't want to be fixed. Only you--only you--would be so arrogant to think that you could fix me or what I've been through. Are you okay, Reva? Did you suffer a fall? Did you bump your head? Well, I did. I fell of the side of a frigging mountain, but you don't hear me whining about it!",
        "Reva: I hear you crying out.",
        "Jonathan: Don't do this. Don't... Don't... whatever it is you think you're doing, don't do it. The sympathy, this identifying with me, you know? None of this crap is going to work with me. I'm fine. It's everybody else that's screwed up.",
        "Reva: And what you did to Tammy?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah? So? You deserve whatever that makes you feel. She deserves it because she's one of you. Her mother deserves it because she didn't tell her what kind of monsters live in the woods and she knows--she knows--because she lives with one herself.",
        "Reva: Jonathan, do you even know what you want besides trying to hurt people as deeply as you can?",
        "Jonathan: That's not enough? Just like any good mother, pushing her little boy to be better. Should I aim higher?",
        "Reva: No. I'm just saying that whatever anger made you do what you did to Tammy may be preventing you from saying what's truly in your heart.",
        "Jonathan: What's truly in my... lady, do you hear yourself? Don't people just want to smack you?",
        "Reva: You know what? I don't even care. I don't even care what you say. I don't care who you think you are, but no son of mine would ever go up against a family that has so much to offer them. I never wanted this. It broke my heart to have to give you away, but I did it because I thought it was what was best for you! We can fix this. We can, because I am not this awful person that you think I am, and I know that you could never be so evil. (Gasps) MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM Next, on \"Guiding Light\"...",
        "Cassie: We've got to find Tammy before he hurts her again.",
        "Edmund: And if we find Jonathan?",
        "Cassie: God help him.",
        "Reva: Jonathan, stop.",
        "Jonathan: What's the matter, Mommy? You scared? I've dreamed about doing this for a long time."
