        "Josh: Reva, I'm here! Come on,\r\nlet's go! Come on, let's go! We've got work to do! Hey, there you are. Oh,\r\ndon't worry, this is not all the decorations I've\r\nbrought. I got a whole bunch of other stuff out of the car, okay? Man, I just\r\nthink it's so great that Marah and Shayne are both coming home for Christmas.\r\nThat's just fantastic, you know? And thank you, by the way. Thank you for\r\ninviting me to come here to decorate with you. It's nice that we've gotten to a\r\nplace where we've do things together like we used to do. Do you remember that\r\ntime that we all made our own tinsel? And we were pulling that stuff out of the\r\ncouch until like, Easter? What is it, Reva? What's wrong? ",
        "Reva: Help me. ",
        "Josh: What? ",
        "Reva: Help me, Bud. Please. ",
        "Cassie: Hey, are you okay? ",
        "Josh: Did I fall asleep? ",
        "Cassie: Why yes, you sure did. Did you have\r\na bad dream? ",
        "Josh: No, not really a bad dream, it was\r\njust-- I was with Reva at Cross Creek. ",
        "Cassie: Oh, okay. Do I want to hear this? ",
        "Josh: No, it was-- it was Christmas time. I\r\nwas there to help her decorate. The kids were coming home but she said\r\nsomething to me about... she said she needed my help. ",
        "Cassie: With what? ",
        "Josh: I don't know. And then she touched my\r\nhand and when I opened up my hand, there was a set of car keys there. ",
        "Cassie: Car keys, okay. What do you think\r\nthat means? ",
        "Josh: I think it should mean that I should\r\nnot take naps after I've eaten Buzz's chili. And in fact, I should not be\r\nresting at all because I have shelves to build for your closet. ",
        "Cassie: Absolutely. ",
        "Josh: Absolutely. ",
        "Cassie: So you shelve away. ",
        "Josh: Okay. ",
        "",
        "Reva: Oh, wow. Oh Billy, it's even more\r\nbeautiful than I thought it would be. It's a stick, right? ",
        "Billy: Oh baby, it's five speeds, 300 horses\r\nunder the hood, front, rear, side air bags and anti-lock braking system. ",
        "Reva: All those safety devices. Pretty much\r\ndefeats the purpose of the trip, doesn't it? ",
        "Billy: Cute. ",
        "Reva: Maybe I should have gotten an old\r\njunker, you know, to make sure I didn't survive the drive off the edge. ",
        "Billy: (Laughs) Step\r\ndown here for a second. You know what I would like you to do? I would like you\r\nto take this out for just a little test drive. Maybe spin over to Cedars and\r\ntalk to Doctor Jacobs. ",
        "Reva: No, no. I'm not going to the hospital.\r\nThere's nothing more the doctors can do. I bought this car for one purpose. If\r\nit's time to go, then I want to make sure I go with the wind in my hair and 300\r\nhorsepower under the hood. ",

        "Alan: Olivia, relax. You're starting to look\r\nguilty. ",
        "Olivia: It's because I am, Alan. ",
        "Alan: It doesn't matter, because the chief\r\nwitness is not going to show up. ",
        "Olivia: Gillespie is right over there. ",
        "Alan: I'm talking about Ava. ",
        "Doris: Your honor, there is absolutely no reason to drop\r\nthe charges against Ms. Spencer. She hired a professional killer to murder Ava Peralta.\r\nAnd I only need to call one witness. The intended victim, Ava\r\nPeralta. ",
        "Bailiff: Do you swear to tell the truth, the\r\nwhole truth, and nothing but the truth? ",
        "Ava: I do. ",
        "",
        "Marina: What are we doing here? ",
        "Mallet: The blogger has posted tons of dirt\r\non Olivia. ",
        "Marina: And you're thinking he might be here for some more\r\ninformation. ",
        "Mallet: Oh, I'm thinking this could be a\r\nvery big day for us. ",
        "",
        "Doris: Ms. Peralta, are you all right? ",
        "Ava: Yes. ",
        "Doris: And you understand the charge filed against Ms.\r\nOlivia Spencer? ",
        "Ava: That she hired someone to kidnap me and\r\nto kill me. ",
        "Doris: And, in fact, a man did accost you,\r\nis that correct? ",
        "Ava: Yes. ",
        "Doris: Is that man in the courtroom today?\r\nCould you please point him out? And you're sure that's the same man? ",
        "Ava: Yes. ",
        "Doris: Ms. Peralta, do you remember what\r\nthat man said to you when he dragged you out of the car that night? ",
        "Ava: That Olivia Spencer wanted me out of\r\nher life, for good. ",
        "",
        "Josh: Hey, how are you? What are you doing\r\nhere? Good to see you. ",
        "Matt: Came by to check on the boss. ",
        "Josh: Oh, thank you. ",
        "Matt: How's everything going? ",
        "Josh: Everything's fantastic. I'm busy and\r\nI'm happy. How about you? How does Vanessa like the new digs? ",
        "Matt: Good, good. It's kind of strange being\r\nback in Springfield. But it's good. Doesn't hurt that I get\r\nmy old job back. ",
        "Josh: Well, when I heard you were coming\r\nback into town, of course, my first thought was, hey, I've got to get him back\r\nat Lewis. And selfishly, of course, I figured you would give the company a\r\nboost which you always did. ",
        "Matt: You're saying that because I said I'd\r\nhelp you move. ",
        "Josh: In fact, you know what? Now that you\r\nmention it, I could use your help right now because I'm building some new\r\nshelves for Cassie\u2019s closet and she's not here because she had to run some\r\nerrands, so what do you think? ",
        "Matt: Okay, working on Cassie\u2019s closet. Is\r\nthere a connection there? ",
        "Josh: I'm not moving in, if that's what\r\nyou're suggesting. I'm just helping her out. ",
        "Matt: Yeah, just a little home improvement. ",
        "Josh: Yeah, you know what? Now I'm thinking\r\nmaybe it wasn't such a good idea to get you back in Lewis because I forgot...\r\nyou think you're a funny guy, don't you, huh? Hey, I moved, by the way, the cabin,\r\nfrom Cross Creek to Springfield. ",
        "Matt: I heard. ",
        "Josh: That was something. ",
        "Matt: I heard that. For\r\nreal, right? ",
        "Josh: Ironic, isn't it? ",
        "Matt: What happened? ",
        "Josh: Actually, it doesn't really matter\r\nanymore. I mean, it doesn't matter anymore because Reva, once again, she's\r\ngoing to take off. She's going to leave town. ",
        "",
        "Reva: My hair is probably too short the see\r\nthe wind whip through it. ",
        "Billy: Don't worry girl, you'll still look\r\nas cool as James Dean. ",
        "Reva: It was Jonathan\u2019s idea. I think it's a\r\npretty good one. ",
        "Billy: You know, maybe Jonathan will regret\r\nit. Now, maybe he needs you. ",
        "Reva: He has a little baby to think about\r\nnow. Not to mention the mother of that baby. I know that things are going to be\r\nfine, they may be tough with Lizzie and Tammy but, they'll all be fine. ",
        "Billy: How come you're not that optimistic\r\nabout yourself? ",
        "Reva: Things are good. ",
        "Billy: Are they? ",
        "Reva: Mm-mmm. Josh is with Cassie and\r\nthey're happy. Marah, Shayne, and Dylan, things are good with them. They're all\r\nin good places. My affairs are in order. Papers are filed, ledgers are written,\r\neverything is perfect for my sayonara. There's just\r\none little loose end. ",
        "Billy: Oh, wait a minute. You're not worried\r\nabout me. ",
        "Reva: I hate the idea of leaving you alone, Billy.\r\n",
        "Billy: Well, I mean, I'm not going to be\r\nalone, I mean, Cassie and Josh are still in my life, your kids are there, my\r\nkids. Hey, look... I have this one little thing that I've kind of arranged for\r\nyou. ",
        "Reva: What? ",
        "Billy: It's a surprise. ",
        "Reva: Billy. You've done too much for me\r\nalready. ",
        "Billy: Maybe I'm doing it for myself. Maybe\r\nI just want to see the look on your face when I spring this on you. ",
        "Reva: Do I get a little hint? ",
        "Billy: No. Tell you what, you can have\r\nthese. ",
        "Reva: Yeah? ",
        "Billy: Yeah. ",
        "Reva: I'm not taking the last drive until I\r\nknow what the surprise is. ",
        "Billy: No, no. You're going to drive us to\r\nit. Only remember one thing: Dead man driving, live guy riding. ",
        "Reva: Okay. ",
        "",
        "Cassie: Reva? Are you there? It's Cassie. Reva? Hello? I'm returning your candle stick. This is\r\nstupid. What did you expect? Might as well be a cross-stitched \"I still\r\nlove Josh\" hanging on the wall. Marijuana? ",
        "Maid: (Laughs)\r\nI'm running behind. I'll be there as soon as I finish here. ",
        "",
        "Matt: You know, I hate power tools, you\r\ncan't hear yourself talk. ",
        "Josh: I'm not avoiding your question, all\r\nright? ",
        "Matt: So does that mean you don't care one\r\nway or the other whether Reva leaves town? ",
        "Josh: What, that's two questions now that I\r\nhave to deal with? ",
        "Matt: Well, it's going to take a while, you\r\nknow, the closet. ",
        "Josh: All right. I had a dream about her. ",
        "Matt: Who? Reva? ",
        "Josh: Yeah, Reva. I was taking a nap in\r\nthere and I had this dream and she said that she needed my help. ",
        "Matt: What do you think that meant? ",
        "Josh: I don't know, Matt, it was a dream. ",
        "Matt: Well, I know, Josh, but it kind of\r\nstuck with you. ",
        "Josh: (Laughs) Well,\r\nokay. You know what? I'll tell you what. I'm going to answer one of your\r\nquestions. I think it's actually a good thing that Reva\u2019s leaving town right\r\nnow. ",
        "Matt: What about Cassie. How's she doing? ",
        "Josh: Things with Cassie are fantastic. I\r\nmean, I just... she's real. Okay? She's straightforward, she's down to earth.\r\nIt's so nice to be with a woman who actually calms me down when I'm with her\r\nand of course she excites the hell out of me from time to time, too, so that's\r\na good thing. ",
        "Matt: That is. Best of\r\nboth worlds. ",
        "Josh: Well, so far, and I want to give it a\r\nreal chance to succeed, you know? ",
        "Matt: And if Reva\u2019s not around? ",
        "Josh: I just think the odds are better. ",
        "Matt: It's all good. ",
        "Josh: I feel like I'm part of a family\r\nagain, you know? I'm with a woman who actually needs me and she needs me because\r\nshe trusts me more than she trusts anybody else. ",

        "Doris: How? ",
        "Ava: She hired me to work for her and then she\r\nfired me two seconds later. I did everything I could to make things better. I\r\neven volunteered to baby-sit for her little girl Emma one night. ",

        "Ava: No. ",
        "Doris: In fact, the longer Emma stayed in a coma, the more\r\nMs. Spencer blamed you for it, hated you for it. In fact, that's why she hired\r\na man to end your life. ",
