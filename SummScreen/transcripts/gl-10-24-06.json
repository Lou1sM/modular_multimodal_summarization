        "Gus: Not bad, huh? ",
        "Harley: It's good. It needs some chips.\r\nHoney, by the way, you're not the one who is supposed to be eating for two, or\r\nthree, or six, in your case. ",
        "Gus: I'm empathic. I'm feeling your hunger.\r\nYou're hungry, I'm hungry. You're pain is my pain. You have labor pains, and\r\nI'll have labor pain. ",

        "Dinah: You know, not that it matters, but I\r\nwas whacked over the head and almost died tonight and all you care about are\r\nyou stupid little secrets staying secrets so you don't lose your stupid\r\ncampaign. ",
        "Jeffrey: All you care about is creating some\r\ndrama so that your favorite detective can save you. Your sick, twisted love\r\nlife is not going to get in the way of what I want. ",

        "Reva: Let me explain. ",
        "Cassie: And I know that you've been leaning\r\non Billy a lot, and it's probably because Josh isn't there for you, and I'm not\r\nthere for you. ",
        "Reva: No Cassie-- ",
        "Cassie: I realize it because things are\r\ncomplicated between us, but did you really think you should keep something like\r\nthis from me? I am your sister. ",
        "Reva: How did you find out? ",
        "Cassie: I put the clues together the last\r\ncouple of days, and then I went to Billy\u2019s and I looked around and... ",
        "Reva: You looked around? ",
        "Cassie: I'm sorry. Reva, we can deal with\r\nthis. ",
        "Reva: No, no, we can\u2019t. No, because you\r\ncould never understand because it's bad. I mean, it's so much worse because\r\nthere isn't a cure. ",

        "Mallet: Yeah, whatever, but it is necessary.\r\n",
        "Harley: For what? ",

        "Mallet: No, I want to stop isolating people\r\nlike that. If we want to catch this guy on this web site, we need to do it\r\ntogether and compare notes. ",

        "Gus: The whole dysfunctional family. ",

        "Mallet: This meeting is about the case. Not\r\nwooing Dinah. I don\u2019t need to drag half the town into some pretext for seeing\r\nDinah when I can see Dinah any time. Did you just say \"Woo\"? ",

        "Reva: Pot? ",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I found your stash. I mean, I\r\nwasn't looking for it, but there it was. And then I did see a prescription for\r\npills. ",
        "Reva: And so you just thought that... ",
        "Cassie: Well, I didn't know what to think.\r\nBut now I'm thinking, are you addicted to pills?\r\nYou're talking some kind of pills? ",

        "Cassie: What kind? ",

        "Cassie: So when I heard you say the other\r\nday that you're going away, it's for rehab? ",
        "Reva: No. No. No, no, no. It's taken care\r\nof. It is. It's all under control. It's so much better now. Because Billy, you\r\nknow, he\u2019s... who better than Billy to be going through this with me, right? \r\n",
