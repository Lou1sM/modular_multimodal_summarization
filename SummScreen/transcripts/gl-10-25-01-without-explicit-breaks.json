        "Michelle: Yoo-hoo.",
        "Danny: Hey.",
        "Michelle: Hi, sweetie. You forgot your lunch. \r\nTurkey and Swiss with Russian dressing-- your favorite.",
        "Danny: It's okay, honey, you can drop the \r\nact. The surveillance cameras aren't functioning yet.",
        "Michelle: Wow. So this is it: The secure \r\nroom.",
        "Danny: Can you close the door? How'd you get \r\npast security?",
        "Michelle: Oh, I\u2019m married to the head of \r\nsecurity.",
        "Danny: That's not good. I've got to look into \r\nthat. All right, well, are you ready for the tour?",
        "Michelle: That's what I\u2019m here for.",
        "Danny: Okay, well, this here, this is in \r\nessence the brain of Spaulding Enterprises and all the holdings. It holds the \r\nkey to all the accounts, the codes, everything.",
        "Michelle: It gives new meaning to putting all \r\nyour eggs in one basket.",
        "Danny: Yeah, well, the theory is that the \r\nmore that you spread information around, the more potential leaks you have.",
        "Michelle: Except in this case, the leak \r\nstopper has been given an ultimatum by some mysterious Mr. Big who wants him to \r\nsteal $25 million to pay for",
        "Danny: Shh...Sh... Sh. It is going to be my \r\nticket out. Just not the way Mr. Big thinks.",
        "Michelle: Right. Well, in any case, it's a \r\nrisk I\u2019m willing to take. This is our clear shot at getting the life we want for \r\nus and for Robbie.",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Michelle: So, what is it you want me to do?",
        "Danny: Okay, well, I think that this is going \r\nto have to be the vent that you come through.",
        "Michelle: It\u2019s a lot smaller than I expected.",
        "Danny: Uh yeah. You're not going to be able \r\nto come from above like I originally thought. So somehow we're going to have to \r\nfind a way to get you from there to here, to the stool, in front of the \r\ncomputer, without touching the heat and pressure sensitive floor and without \r\ntripping off the laser motion detectors, which are going to run at a random \r\npattern that's generated by the computer. And the pattern's going to change \r\nevery single day.",
        "Michelle: Well, it's a piece of cake. What \r\nabout surveillance cameras?",
        "Danny: Well, they feed to monitors in the \r\nnext room. I'm somehow going to have to disable them before you come through the \r\nvent.",
        "Michelle: There's so much that can go wrong.",
        "Danny: Yeah. There is.",
        "Michelle: Are you afraid that I can't pull \r\nthis off?",
        "Danny: No, no.",
        "Phillip: Well, hey. This is a nice surprise.",
        "Danny: Hey.",
        "Phillip: Nobody told me it was \"bring your \r\nwife to work day.\" Hi, Michelle.",
        "Michelle: Hi.",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nCassie: Alonzo.",
        "Alonzo: Look, I\u2019m sorry to bother you.",
        "Cassie: You're not bothering me. Come in, sit \r\ndown.",
        "Alonzo: No, no thanks. Is the president \r\naround?",
        "Cassie: \"The president?\" Wow, aren't you \r\nformal today?",
        "Alonzo: Why don't you just tell him it\u2019s a \r\nformal visit?",
        "Cassie: Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait. What's wrong?",
        "Alonzo: The coastal commission says they want \r\nto do away with the fishing wharves in the harbor-- just tear them down.",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Alonzo: It kills me, what government types \r\ncall progress. You know, while they're at it, why don't they just get rid of all \r\nthe fishermen as well? Then they can have their precious waterfront, build all \r\nthe fancy hotels they want, plus the stores and get all the tourist dollars they \r\nneed.",
        "Cassie: Okay, hold on. Hold on, okay. \r\nObviously this isn't a done deal, because if it were, you wouldn't have made it \r\na point to come in here and try and find Richard to help you, right?",
        "Alonzo: Little miss ray of hope.",
        "Cassie: All I\u2019m saying is there has to be a \r\nsolution to this problem. Well, you are upset about this.",
        "Alonzo: These are my friends we're talking \r\nabout, my people.",
        "Dax: \"My people.\" Wonderful. It's working.",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nReva: Excuse me? What consequences? Why would you say the past should stay \r\nburied?",
        "Gentleman: I think you know.",
        "Reva: There are people who believe that the \r\npast is never really gone; that it isn't even past.",
        "Gentleman: Yes. People who cannot face the \r\npresent, much less the future.",
        "Reva: Speak for yourself.",
        "Gentleman: Well, perhaps I am.",
        "Reva: What, do you get a real kick out of \r\ntrying to scare the tourists?",
        "Gentleman: (Laughs) you're no tourist, ma'am.",
        "Reva: You're right. I came here, to New \r\nOrleans, to this house to find out exactly what happened in 1862, during the \r\nCivil War. Here. Do you know?",
        "Gentleman: Leave this house alone, Reva \r\nShayne.",
        "Reva: How do you know my name? Who are you?",
        "Gentleman: Perhaps one of the consequences.",
        "Reva: What, do you work here? You saw me sign \r\nmy name in the guest book?",
        "Gentleman: Why have you come to snoop around \r\nthis house and ask so many questions?",
        "Reva: What business is it of yours?",
        "Gentleman: Well, what business is it of \r\nyours?",
        "Reva: Are you a Robechaux?",
        "Gentleman: The Robechaux are gone. Let them \r\nrest in peace.",
        "Reva: I don't think they are at peace.",
        "Gentleman: Well, you know nothing about it.",
        "Reva: What happened to Jack Robechaux?",
        "Gentleman: Leave New Orleans, Ms. Shayne. Go \r\nhome. Don't look back. You don't know what you're dealing with.",
        "Reva: Wait! No. What... What is he so scared \r\nI\u2019ll find out?",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nMichelle: All Danny talks about is this impregnable security system of yours. I \r\nhad to take a peek. Oh, I hope that's not a problem.",
        "Phillip: No, of course not.",
        "Michelle: I don't understand any of it.",
        "Phillip: Oh, hey, you're not alone. I'm not \r\nsure I understand half of it, either. It's all very high tech stuff. Star wars \r\nsort of stuff. Your husband knows his way around a security system, let me tell \r\nyou that.",
        "Michelle: Yes, he does.",
        "Phillip: And I don't think we need to say \r\nanything about where he got that knowledge.",
        "Danny: No, no, no. We'll just be glad that I \r\ndid.",
        "Phillip: I'm very glad you did. I'm glad \r\nyou're here, as opposed to working for the competition, I can tell you that.",
        "Michelle: You know, Phillip, you really have \r\nto come by the house and see Rick, and I know he would love to show you his new \r\nson. And if it's Harley, we can make sure she's not there, if it's awkward.",
        "Phillip: Um, I appreciate that, Michelle, I \r\nreally do. I think \"awkward\"... I'm not even sure that \"awkward\" really covers \r\nit at the moment.",
        "Michelle: Well, the longer you and Rick allow \r\nit to be awkward, the harder it's going to be to get back to where you were.",
        "Phillip: All right. But you know what? \r\nSometimes you just got to give this stuff a little bit of time. Speaking of \r\nwhich, Danny, when do we get all these bells and whistles operational?",
        "Danny: Well, hopefully... I'm hoping maybe \r\nlater today. I just need to make sure that everything's working properly.",
        "Phillip: Well, you better make damn sure. \r\nThey would have access to all of our financial holdings.",
        "Danny: Sure. That's why we have a whole \r\nsystem of backups.",
        "Phillip: You know what? That's exactly right, \r\nand we are in complete agreement on that. And as a matter of fact, I\u2019ve got a \r\nbackup for you. It's really just a consultant, sort of an expert in security. I \r\nthink you all know each other.",
        "Gus: Howdy, folks.",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nAlonzo: Compromise? You don't compromise on something that just shouldn't \r\nhappen. It isn't right, and that's all there is to it.",
        "Richard: What isn't right?",
        "Alonzo: Plenty of things. But this is the one \r\nI'm working on now.",
        "Richard: This is a memo from the Internal \r\nCoastal Commission. Where'd you get hold of this?",
        "Alonzo: I found it on the desk I\u2019ve been \r\nusing down there.",
        "Richard: Really?",
        "Cassie: Richard, there's been talk...",
        "Alonzo: It's not talk. It's a plan.",
        "Cassie:...About ripping out the commercial \r\nfishing wharves in the harbor.",
        "Richard: Oh, right. I know.",
        "Cassie: Oh, so you've seen it.",
        "Richard: Well, I haven't seen this memo, but \r\nI'm certainly aware of all the issues, yeah.",
        "Alonzo: And you're fine with all of it.",
        "Richard: Well, Alonzo, I do realize-- and I \r\ndo want to emphasize the word \"if\" here--If this proposal is effected, that it \r\nwill displace a number of fishermen, but these fishermen will still be able to \r\nearn a living-- and not to mention that the harbor project is going to generate \r\nmillions in revenue and hundreds of jobs for others, and that's going to be \r\nvital to San Cristobel\u2019s recovery.",
        "Alonzo: (Applauds) nice speech.",
        "Cassie: Uh, I don't know why you're so upset. \r\nIt sounds like a win-win situation, Alonzo.",
        "Alonzo: No! The only people who are going to \r\ncome out of this all right are the developers.",
        "Richard: Just a minute.",
        "Alonzo: I understand what they're after here. \r\nThey want a tourist-friendly theme park of a harbor-- a place that looks like a \r\nquaint old antique tropical fishing port. But one that's a moneymaker. You know \r\nwhat? Long as it puts revenue in the treasury and gets San Cristobel back on \r\ntheir feet again.",
        "Cassie: So what's the problem?",
        "Alonzo: It's going to be a disaster for all \r\nthe fishermen. All the other towns, their wharves, they can't handle any more \r\nboats.",
        "Richard: Well, we'll just have to build more.",
        "Alonzo: And the rich get richer. You know \r\nwhat? If you're a working fisherman, you can't just weigh anchor and work out of \r\nanother port. These men, they have families and friends right here, in this \r\nport. This is their home; it's not just here they work. If this suggestion gets \r\npassed, you're not just relocating an industry; you're killing a community.",
        "Richard: This wasn't brought up in my \r\nbriefings.",
        "Alonzo: What a surprise.",
        "Richard: I try not to take a cynical view.",
        "Cassie: You know, Richard, maybe this is the \r\nkey to working this out.",
        "Richard: How do you mean?",
        "Cassie: Maybe we should talk to the people \r\nwho are being affected, you know? Why don't we try, you know, holding some \r\nhearings, set up a public forum for these people on both sides of the issues to \r\nspeak their minds?",
        "Alonzo: Yeah. I like that speech a lot \r\nbetter.",
        "Richard: No. No. Absolutely not.",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nAlan: Excellent. That's exactly what I want. Keep me informed on that. Well, I \r\ndidn't even have to threaten to get you to come over here this time. Now that is \r\nprogress.",
        "Olivia: Guess again.",
        "Alan: Oh, now, Olivia, are we going to play \r\nthat game where you pout and protest and pretend that I\u2019m forcing myself on you, \r\nand then we make wild abandoned love?",
        "Olivia: I know what you did, and I don't \r\nappreciate it.",
        "Alan: What I did?",
        "Olivia: You deliberately left your money clip \r\nin my apartment.",
        "Alan: Deliberately?",
        "Olivia: And when Josh found it-- which you \r\nundoubtedly hoped he would-- he came to confront you so that you could argue.",
        "Alan: That sounds like something I would do.",
        "Olivia: Well, it was a big mistake.",
        "Alan: You know, I thought you would \r\nappreciate my fair- mindedness, Olivia. I mean, I think it's only fair that Josh \r\nshould know he should never take you for granted-- not that it will matter at \r\nall in the long run.",
        "Olivia: I love him, Alan! Only him. I will \r\nnever leave him.",
        "Alan: But will he leave you? That's what \r\nyou're not certain of-- especially when he finds out that you have the hots for \r\nhis arch-enemy.",
        "Olivia: Oh, get over yourself. The only \r\nreason I entered into this sick relationship was to keep you quiet about the \r\nkickbacks I was forced to give in San Cristobel.",
        "Alan: I know, and you've hated every minute \r\nof it.",
        "Olivia: All you ever had was my body.",
        "Alan: Do you think that Josh will understand \r\nthe distinction?",
        "Olivia: Okay. You know, obviously you enjoy \r\ntoying with Josh and if that's what you need to do to save face, fine. Let's \r\nfigure we're even. Call it a day. It's over. I was meant to be with Josh, and \r\nGod help the person who comes between us.",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nReva: \"I remain yours always. Always, Jack. P.S. Do not grieve for me, but trust \r\nyour heart.\" You wrote that for me, not for her. But why have you called me back \r\nhere now? Am I supposed to find out something about you or about myself? What \r\nhappened to the dispatches? Why was Jack Robechaux executed? ",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nOlivia: I'm not kidding. You're not calling the shots here.",
        "Alan: If you say so.",
        "Olivia: So be grateful for what you get.",
        "Alan: (Laughs) grateful for what I get, huh?",
        "Olivia: You want me. All I have to do is walk \r\nthrough the door and you want me, right here, now.",
        "Alan: What ever made Josh Lewis think that he \r\nwas all the man that you would ever need.",
        "Olivia: Because I\u2019m all the woman that he \r\nneeds.",
        "Alan: Mm. You're more woman than he could \r\never handle.",
        "Olivia: Don't get into a spitting contest \r\nwith my husband because you'll lose.",
        "Alan: Ooh. Such a mouth.",
        "Olivia: I turn you on.",
        "Alan: Mm-hmm. And that turns you on.",
        "Olivia: Just so long as you understand that \r\nit's when I want, where I want and how I want. You mess with my marriage, Alan, \r\nyou won't get within 50 feet of me. You got it?",
        "Alan: Someday you'll feel that way about me.",
        "Olivia: Another remark like that and I\u2019m \r\ngoing to get out of here.",
        "Alan: I really believe what I just told you.",
        "Olivia: I mean it. And if you drag Josh into \r\nthis in any way, we're through. This game is between you and me.",
        "Alan: Point, set, match.",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nRichard: The harbor is the key to San Cristobel-- no one will argue that-- but I \r\nam not going to allow economic development to take precedence over the very \r\npeople it's intended to benefit.",
        "Cassie: What do you suggest we do, Mr. \r\nPresident?",
        "Richard: I suggest that we meet with the \r\nlocal fishermen-- now, today. Alonzo, will you help?",
        "Alonzo: That's why I came.",
        "Richard: Good.",
        "Alonzo: And the weather is in our favor: \r\nThere's a storm brewing offshore. It kept most of the fleet in today. There's \r\nplenty of guys around.",
        "Cassie: So you could get us in touch with \r\nthem?",
        "Alonzo: I'll convince a few of them to come \r\nup here, right?",
        "Cassie: No. Richard, I think we should go to \r\nthem.",
        "Richard: An impromptu town meeting.",
        "Alonzo: But wait...",
        "Richard: Dax, will you come in here, please? \r\nThank you so much for bringing this to my attention, Alonzo.",
        "Dax: Yes, sir.",
        "Richard: Yes, Dax. Well do we have a new \r\nassistant?",
        "Dax: (Laughs) Mrs. Mayhew was in consultation \r\nwhen you buzzed, sir.",
        "Mayhew: I hope you don't mind my coming in to \r\nsay hello, ",
        "Richard: Ah, very good, Mrs. Mayhew. Very \r\ngood. We're trying to cure Mrs. Mayhew of the habit of calling me \"your \r\nhighness.\"",
        "Alonzo: How could anybody get used to hearing \r\nthat?",
        "Dax: How may I be of help?",
        "Richard: Well, the three of us are going to \r\nvisit the local fishing community.",
        "Dax: Now?",
        "Richard: Yes.",
        "Cassie: The sooner the better.",
        "Richard: So I\u2019ll need you to prepare two \r\nmotorcades and all the proper security detail.",
        "Dax: Of course. I'll see to everything.",
        "Richard: Thank you very much, Colonel. Shall \r\nwe?",
        "Dax: This is even better than I hoped. Not \r\nonly were my friends on the Coastal Commission able to galvanize Alonzo into \r\naction, now he'll get a first-hand look at true leadership. By his brother.",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nPhillip: I'm sorry, Danny. I didn't mean to spring this on you.",
        "Danny: Well, you did. I just don't see the \r\npoint, really.",
        "Gus: Very nice job, Danny. Very nice. You've \r\ngot this place locked up really good and tight. Oh, you better warn your old \r\nbuddies that Spaulding\u2019s off limits.",
        "Danny: So, are the insipid remarks part of \r\nhis job, too?",
        "Gus: Oh, no. I throw those in for free.",
        "Phillip: Well, I have all the plans for this \r\nroom in my office. Why don't we go take a look?",
        "Gus: Yes, absolutely, boss. Oh, wait a \r\nsecond. Do you call him \"boss\"? Because if you call him \"boss,\" I don't have to \r\ncall him \"boss.\" I can call him something else. It's okay with me; I don't mind.",
        "Danny: Before they stripped your badge away, \r\nthis obsession of yours with me was at least a part of your job.",
        "Gus: Oh, no, it's still part of my job. It's \r\njust a different job. You, Michelle, do you spend a lot of time here?",
        "Michelle: This is how you fill your pathetic \r\nlife? It's really sad and very creepy.",
        "Gus: You know what? I have a right to a \r\nliving just like anybody else, and if everything here is on the up- and-up, \r\nwell, then we can all just get rich at Spaulding\u2019s expense. What's the problem?",
        "Phillip: I think this is going to work out \r\nfine.",
        "Michelle: Great. That's just great.",
        "Danny: We don't have much time.",
        "Phillip: Danny hasn't put the security \r\ncameras on line yet. At least not the ones that he installed. I believe in \r\nbackups.",
        "Gus: Very good, Mr. S. Remind me never to \r\ncross you. You, sir. What do you think? Is this plan going to hurt you? Could it \r\nhelp you in some way, perhaps?",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nHowie: It's hard to say.",
        "Alonzo: What? Come on. The Howie Hughes I \r\nknow has got an opinion about everything. Look who's listening to you now. This \r\nis the president. Take your shot!",
        "Richard: All right, all right, all right. \r\nAnybody? The first thing that popped into your heads when you heard that those \r\nwharves were going to be torn down?",
        "Alonzo: Oh, for crying out loud. You thought, \r\n\"hell, the suits, they're going to put us out of business as sure as the high \r\ntide follows the low.\" Come on, would you speak up while there's still time to \r\nbe heard?",
        "Simons: It's a tough thing, a way of \r\nprogress.",
        "Richard: Well, would that be progress?",
        "Cassie: Do you think it's time to pull \r\ntogether, make sacrifices? Is that it?",
        "Simons: Will it hurt to lose the wharves? \r\nYeah. But would it be worth it? Maybe so.",
        "Walton: Who are you trying to kid, huh?",
        "Richard: Please, sir, join us.",
        "Walton: What for? This meeting's a joke. And \r\nit's a crummy one at that.",
        "Alonzo: Why don't you go back to your table, \r\nWalton?",
        "Walton: Whoa, whoa. Didn't I hear right? I \r\nthought the president wants to know what the citizens have got to say.",
        "Richard: You did hear right. So, why is this \r\na joke?",
        "Walton: Because you're going to do what you \r\nwant, anyhow. Shove us out of the harbor, put us out of business. Hell, why'd \r\nyou even bother coming down here? Oh. So you can tell yourself you tried to help \r\nthe poor working folk, huh? That how it is? Huh? Mr. President?",
        "\r\n__________________________________________",
        "\r\nPhillip: I just wanted you to see... Wait a minute. That's odd.",
        "Danny: Aitoro's going to be back any minute, \r\nso I've got to show you everything I can right now and try to get everything \r\nelse on video.",
        "Michelle: How did you find a camera that \r\nsmall?",
        "Danny: A friend of a friend. Those other \r\ncameras are going to be our concern right now.",
        "Michelle: Okay, so there's what, eight of \r\nthem total?",
        "Danny: Right. They cover the entire room, but \r\nthey're also designed so that if one of them goes out, then they all will start \r\npivoting so that every single camera can cover anything that's happening \r\nthroughout the room.",
        "Michelle: That's what you meant about \r\nbackups.",
        "Danny: Yeah.

Maybe putting the fox in charge of the hen house was just too \r\nmuch. Although... Hang on just a second; I'll give you your shot. Since you seem \r\nto want to play this out, Danny, go ahead.
