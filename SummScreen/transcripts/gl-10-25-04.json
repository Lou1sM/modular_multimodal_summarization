(JB) At the Hospital, Tammy slaps Sandy in the face and blames him for what JB did to her. Sandy can't stand the guilt because he was unable to stop what JB did to Tammy. Sandy decides to leave town because he doesn't want to hurt the people he loves anymore. Sandy shares his feelings of guilt over his lie with Lizzie. Liz is moved by his words and decides to tell Sandy the truth about the accident but thinks better of it when Harley arrives to question Sandy. Sandy tells Harley he didn't see the person who hit him. At Josh and Reva's house, JB and Reva have a very heated and almost violent confrontation. Reeve explains why she chose to give JB up for adoption. JB tells Reva of the years of abuse he suffered at the hands of his adoptive father.

        "Harley: Okay. Let's hurry because I've got about an hour before I have to morph into Ruth Karloff, super sleuth.",
        "Bill: Yeah, able to leap tall Spaulding's and pound them into dust?",
        "Harley: Oh, we're going to dust one of them right now. Take a look at this. Do you see it?",
        "Bill: They look exactly alike.",
        "Harley: Oh, yeah. These are the tread marks left behind by the car at Sandy's accident, and these are tire tracks left by Phillip's car. Lab confirms they're a match.",
        "Bill: Hit and run. Do you know what this means?",
        "Harley: I know what this means. It means we got him. (Laughter)",
        "Bill: Oh, my goodness.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Okay, Kyra, just tell her to call me if you see her, please? All right, thank you.",
        "Edmund: You still haven't found her?",
        "Cassie: No. She's disappeared. I've called Reva, I've called every single one of her friends, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: We'll find her. We will. We'll find her. How did you tell her?",
        "Cassie: (Laughs) how do you tell her something like that? I told her as gently as I possibly could, but there's no way to cushion it. I mean, it is what it is. She didn't want to hear that JB was her cousin, Jonathan, and she certainly didn't want to hear that Jonathan only slept with her to get back at Reva. I mean, she... I've never seen that look on her face before. It was horror and it was despair. It was like she'd given up.",
        "Edmund: No. She's a strong girl, Cassie. She is. She's just... she's gone off someplace to figure out how to deal with the whole Jonathan thing.",
        "Cassie: God! If I get my hands on that kid, I'm going to kill him. If he sees me coming, he better run the other way. He has violated my daughter. He has humiliated my daughter. She will never be the same again, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: She will, Cassie. She will. She will, with our help. I'm just sorry I wasn't here earlier when you needed me. I'm sorry.",
        "Cassie: Where were you?",
        "Edmund: With Dinah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Looking for trouble?",
        "Danny: Why? Have I found it? (Tires squealing)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I've got to tell Sandy. I've got to tell him before this kills me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: You said you were my cousin! How could you... why? Why?",
        "Sandy: I tried to stop Jonathan. I'm sorry.",
        "Tammy: Sorry? You're sorry? I slept with him! It's so sick! And you knew who he was all along. You knew.",
        "Sandy: I tried to warn you. I did.",
        "Tammy: You didn't try to warn me. You weaseled your way into my family and tried to be one of us. And that's why it happened. Everything that happened-- everything--is your fault.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Jonathan...",
        "Jonathan: How's this for a reunion? Boy finds mom, wraps his hands around her loving neck, and he can't let go.",
        "Reva: Jonathan, stop.",
        "Jonathan: What's the matter, Mommy? You scared? I've dreamed about doing this for a long time.",
        "Reva: You don't want to kill me, do you?",
        "Jonathan: What would make you think that?",
        "Reva: Because if that's what you wanted, you had many other opportunities to do it. You don't want to kill me. What you want is my attention. Well, you've got it.",
        "Jonathan: Fight me. Damn you, fight me! (Grunts)",
        "Reva: I knew you wouldn't do it.",
        "Jonathan: You don't know anything. You don't know who you're dealing with!",
        "Reva: I know that you're my son! Why are you doing this? Why are you here, in my home, attacking me?",
        "Jonathan: Maybe I wanted to give you a taste? A little feel of what it was like for me? Well, it always started the same way. I'd be late, you know, coming home from school, or maybe my report card didn't measure up, and that's when he started in.",
        "Reva: You mean Alfred?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Yeah, Alfred. That guy you left me with, my so-called father. Yeah, that wonderful man used to kick me around like a soccer ball when he wasn't trying to break my neck. I don't know, uh... he used to say... he used to say it wasn't a punishment, that it was a reminder. \"It's a tough world we live in, and I'm going to teach you how to live in it.\"",
        "Reva: Jonathan, the last time I saw you, when I brought you to the palace, you seemed so happy.",
        "Jonathan: Happy? Happy? That's because it wasn't as bad when I was little. His drinking was under control. Even Aunt Olivia didn't see it. Plus, I was a very good actor. But when I got... when I got older, you know, he'd come in and he'd take me like this, and he'd say, \"who do you think you are, boy? Huh? Royalty? Well, you're no one. Nothing.\"",
        "Reva: That wasn't true.",
        "Jonathan: I didn't know I wasn't his flesh and blood back then, but he did, and when he drank, it bothered him. Maybe he thought I was better than him, I don't know. Maybe he thought that I thought I was better, you know? Which is pretty funny, since my own mother didn't want me.",
        "Reva: I did want you. You were my heart!",
        "Jonathan: Don't you lie to me!",
        "Reva: I didn't know about Alfred. If I had known, I would have come back. I would have and I would have dealt with him personally.",
        "Jonathan: But you didn't. You left me there to fend for myself. You left me. You abandoned me. You dropped me on him and you never looked back!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Nice song. Don't you love this place?",
        "Dinah: I take it you come here often?",
        "Danny: Me? No. I'm usually working a little too hard, but tonight I wanted to get out and...",
        "Dinah: Have a little fun?",
        "Danny: Something like that. Take a break. I'm tired of trying to fix things, hold things together, especially things that don't even exist anymore.",
        "Dinah: Well, I don't know what exactly that means...",
        "Danny: I don't, either.",
        "Dinah: But I do know what it's like to try to hold things together.",
        "Danny: You do, huh?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. And sometimes it feels good to just let it go.",
        "Danny: I've heard what happens when you let it go.",
        "Dinah: Oh. (Laughs) likewise.",
        "Danny: You know, you're a very attractive woman.",
        "Dinah: You sound surprised. (Laughs)",
        "Danny: Um, no, It's just... It's been a while. I'm rusty.",
        "Dinah: I think you're doing just fine.",
        "Danny: Can I buy you a drink?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Sure. But I don't know if that's such a good idea. Don't you think people might talk?",
        "Danny: Who cares?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: I had a meeting with Jeffrey O'Neill, and when I got there, you'll never believe what I saw.",
        "Cassie: Oh, try me.",
        "Edmund: Well, Dinah with her hand in O'Neill's safe.",
        "Cassie: So, what, she was trying to steal his money?",
        "Edmund: No, no. She was... well, she works for him.",
        "Cassie: Why am I even thinking about Dinah when my daughter is missing? Buzz, hey. It's Cassie. Have you seen Tammy? Well, is Marina around? Okay, thank you. She works for him? What kind of explanation is that, Edmund?",
        "Edmund: I Don't know. I Don't know. She was organizing things, and so she said at least, and she took everything out, and I saw her put everything back, and I left.",
        "Cassie: Everything? Everything like what?",
        "Edmund: Well, important papers and, um...",
        "Cassie: \"And, um\" what?",
        "Edmund: You're right Cassie. This is not important. Focus on other things.",
        "Cassie: Ssh. Okay, yeah. Okay, well, if you or Marina see her, will you please have her call me? Thank you, Buzz. Thanks. Okay. She's not there and I can't sit around here waiting for her to show up, because what if she doesn't?",
        "Edmund: Come on, let's go. There must be some place we haven't thought about. Some place...",
        "Cassie: That bar. That bar. That's where Sandy's accident was. What is it called? Is it Marley's? It's... I don't know. Oh, my God, Edmund. That's where she was with Jonathan. We've got to find Tammy before he hurts her again.",
        "Edmund: And if we find Jonathan?",
        "Cassie: God help him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Tammy, please. Sit down. I can't stand seeing you like this.",
        "Tammy: You could have stopped it. You could have stopped all of it.",
        "Sandy: I tried. I tried to tell Reva the truth about Jonathan before surgery, and she wouldn't let me speak. And then they put me under, and when I woke up, you were standing there next to my bed with him, and I tried to warn you, but I couldn't move, and I couldn't speak...",
        "Tammy: Before that.",
        "Sandy: Before that, I was living in a dream world. You have to understand, I had finally found what I... what I wanted my whole life: A family to love.",
        "Tammy: And they weren't yours. You had to know he would come back.",
        "Sandy: I thought he was dead. There was a hiking incident. When I found out he was alive, I came... I came to warn you. The night of the accident.",
        "Tammy: It doesn't matter, Sandy. It's because of you that he found me. It's because of you that he touched me. (Sobs) it was my first time, did you know that? And I slept with my cousin. I was just a target. I was nothing more than... how would you feel if... how would you feel?",
        "Sandy: Tammy. I'm so sorry. I lived a lie, and I'm sorry that you had to pay for it.",
        "Josh: This whole family paid for it. But no more, because I'm going to make sure that you never hurt any of us again.",
        "Sandy: I'm trying to find a way to make this right, Josh.",
        "Josh: You're way too late for that. Let's go, sweetheart. Tammy. It's going to be okay. I know that right now it seems like the world is coming to an end, but it's not.",
        "Tammy: And I'll forget? Is that what you're going to say?",
        "Josh: No, I wasn't going to say that. I won't lie to you, sweetheart. You won't forget. But bad memories have a way of fading away. We learn from them, and then we move on.",
        "Tammy: No. You think I'm pathetic.",
        "Josh: That's not true.",
        "Tammy: And that's almost as bad as what Jonathan did to me.",
        "Sandy: Lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: Is this a bad time?",
        "Sandy: No, no. Come in. I could use a friend right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I don't know what I'm going to do if I go in there and Tammy is with Jonathan.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, look at me. Look at me. You've been making a lot of threats lately.",
        "Cassie: Well, a lot of people have been coming after my family, Edmund. What am I supposed to do?",
        "Edmund: Be careful. Because one of these days, you're going to follow through on one of those threats, and you don't want that.",
        "Cassie: I'm just scared for my little girl.",
        "Edmund: I know, I know. Just stay close to me and let me handle this, all right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: (Laughs)",
        "Danny: Really?",
        "Dinah: Yeah.",
        "Edmund: Well, I don't see Tammy.",
        "Cassie: No.",
        "Edmund: Come on, Cassie, let's just move on.",
        "Cassie: No, not yet. That tarantula is here, and it looks like she's found her next victim.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I understand what happened.",
        "Jonathan: No, you don't understand anything.",
        "Reva: I do. I do, I do! I trusted him to be a good father to you. But he tortured you. I know you went to bed at night afraid, you woke up in the morning afraid, and when you found out you were adopted, that someone had actually sent you there to live with him, your hate turned to rage. And now you are so overwhelmed with anger inside, and you have nowhere to go with it.",
        "Jonathan: Are you going to kiss it and make it all better, Mommy?",
        "Reva: No. Don't do that! Don't do that! Do not turn what I say to you into something ugly because I can't turn back the clock. I'm sorry that you were raised by people who didn't love you, who hurt you, who made you feel like you were second-rate because you were adopted, who made you believe that your real mother didn't give a damn about you when that was the farthest thing from the truth. You learned to hate at such a young age, but you've got to stop taking it out on people like Tammy. She was an innocent victim, just like you were. And if you keep hurting people like that, then you are no better than the man who did it to you. So, come on. You want to crush me? You want to punish me? Then come on, this is your time. You do it. If it'll make you feel better, if it'll ease some of your pain, then do it. Do it now.",
        "Jonathan: Let go.",
        "Reva: No. I won't let go. I let go of you once, and look what happened. I will never let go of you again. So, this is it. We're finally together after all these years. It's your moment now. You do what you have to do, just like I did what I had to do all those years ago to protect you, to keep you safe, because I loved you!",
        "Jonathan: Let go!",
        "Reva: I loved you. I did. I loved you. From the moment you were born, I loved you. I loved you. I loved your face, but I couldn't keep you. I couldn't, because you wouldn't be here today. You wouldn't. You wouldn't be alive. You wouldn't have seen your first birthday. I had to make a choice. Now I know that was the wrong choice to make, but I made it. So it's your turn now, okay? You make the choice. Come on. Make it.",
        "Jonathan: What do you think? It's that easy? Huh? Like you can just bluff me and I'll back down? Huh? I am the one calling the shots!",
        "Josh: I don't think so!",
        "Reva: Josh! No, no, no, no, no. Stop.",
        "Josh: Hello, Jonathan. My name is Joshua Lewis, and that's my wife, and if you ever, ever lay a hand on her again, or any other member of my family, I will see to it that you...",
        "Reva: Stop it!",
        "Josh: ...Deep, down dark inside a prison where you will never see the light of day again. Do you understand?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah.",
        "Josh: You sure?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Chill out, man.",
        "Josh: Chill out?",
        "Jonathan: Chill out.",
        "Josh: Chill out!",
        "Reva: No, no, no, no! No! For the love of God, let him go, please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: What's up?",
        "Lizzie: I should have came earlier, Sandy.",
        "Sandy: Why? To visit? To give me magazines?",
        "Lizzie: I should have, but I couldn't. I just... when I found out you were hit, I almost lost it.",
        "Sandy: Why?",
        "Lizzie: Sandy, it was a shock. I didn't even know it was you or how bad it was until I got to the hospital, but I swear, I was out in the waiting room before you went to surgery, and I probably should have visited you then, but...",
        "Sandy: Hey, hey, hey, it's okay. Thanks for coming. You're probably the only person in town who cares if I live or die.",
        "Lizzie: You're not going to die, Sandy.",
        "Sandy: It's all over for me. I won't be around much longer.",
        "Lizzie: Did the doctors say that? Because, Sandy, they have specialists. I can call my dad. I can take care of it.",
        "Sandy: I'm not talking about dying. I'm talking about something else, something I could have changed if I hadn't got mowed down by the car.",
        "Lizzie: Sandy, you can't just blame yourself for something that happened because of the accident.",
        "Sandy: Yeah, it would be great if I could just blame the freak who hit me and left me for dead. Then I could have... if I hadn't been taken out, I bet I could have stopped him.",
        "Lizzie: Stopped who?",
        "Sandy: No more questions. I can't... all the questions. Everyone--you, Josh, Tammy... I don't have the strength. I don't know what to do. I can't just fix everything.",
        "Lizzie: Sandy, I'm sorry. You have to believe me. I've never been more sorry about anything in my entire life.",
        "Sandy: What are you talking about, Lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: There's something I have to tell you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Okay, so we have an abandoned car, we have tire tracks that match the scene of an accident. Is that enough to file a case?",
        "Harley: No. We're going to have to go back to Phillip's car. We're going to have to check out that dent and see if there is blood, see if there's any pieces of clothing, anything that will tie it to the car that struck Sandy.",
        "Bill: Listen to you. Once a cop, always a cop.",
        "Harley: Yeah.",
        "Bill: Very thorough. Love to see you frisk somebody.",
        "Harley: I bet you would. (Laughter) anyway, obviously I am stuck behind a desk sharpening Phillip's pencils, so I thought maybe you could go check out the car. What do you think?",
        "Bill: Sure. Yeah, I can do that. Tomorrow I'll stop by to pick up some of Olivia's things, and I'll slip out the back.",
        "Harley: Tomorrow?",
        "Bill: Tomorrow.",
        "Harley: What about tonight?",
        "INS Agent: What about tonight?",
        "Harley: You're... I know you. You're the...",
        "INS Agent: Ryan Lafferty. Department of Immigration and Naturalization. How's married life?",
        "Harley: Me? I wouldn't know.",
        "INS Agent: Olivia Spencer Lewis?",
        "Bill: Oh, no, no, no. This is Harley Cooper. She's a friend of mine.",
        "INS Agent: Hm. I see. And your wife is...",
        "Bill: She's not here.",
        "INS Agent: Interesting.",
        "Bill: How so?",
        "INS Agent: We've been having a lot of problems with Americans marrying foreign nationals who would otherwise be deported.",
        "Bill: You're suggesting that I married Olivia just to keep her here in the country.",
        "INS Agent: I'm not suggesting anything. But I must admit I find it surprising.",
        "Bill: You find what surprising?",
        "INS Agent: That you'd be here with your \"friend\" instead of, say, on your honeymoon?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Small world, isn't it?",
        "Danny: Cassie. Hey.",
        "Cassie: Hey.",
        "Danny: How are you?",
        "Cassie: Mind if I cut in? Please, please tell me you're drunk.",
        "Danny: Well...",
        "Cassie: You are going to wake up very sorry in the morning, Danny.",
        "Danny: Cassie, I couldn't possibly feel any worse than I have felt for the past couple of months. Don't worry about it. I'm fine. Really, I am. Dinah, do you want to get another round? Come on, Cassie, have a drink.",
        "Cassie: Wow, Jeffrey wasn't enough, huh? So I see that you've dug your talon into another unsuspecting man.",
        "Edmund: Come on, Cassie. We have more important things to worry about.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, we do, so I'm going to get right to the point. What did you do with Jeffrey's money?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, for heaven's sake.",
        "Dinah: I don't believe it. You told her about the safe?",
        "Edmund: Cassie and I share everything.",
        "Dinah: Everything, huh?",
        "Edmund: Come on, Cassie, let's go.",
        "Danny: See you guys.",
        "Dinah: You know, Eddie, did you tell Cassie about the photo we found in the safe?",
        "Edmund: Shut up, Dinah.",
        "Cassie: What photo?",
        "Dinah: The photo of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Uh, yeah. Well, my wife is not here because she's working. And unfortunately, that's why we didn't go on our honeymoon: Because of work. Not that we don't like our work. We do. We love it. We love it almost as much as we love one another, but...",
        "Harley: But they're... they are partners...",
        "Bill: Yeah. Yeah, in fact it was love at first sight, though it took her a while to convince me. (Laughs) just kidding.",
        "INS Agent: Sounds like a match made in heaven.",
        "Bill: Well, we... it is.",
        "Harley: It is. It's heaven. (Laughs)",
        "INS Agent: Curious, though. I show her address as a hotel here in town, and yours as an apartment in the old grain exchange building.",
        "Bill: Yeah. Yeah. Just, like I said, we're so busy with work that it's taken a while to get all of her shoes over there.",
        "Harley: Yeah. I can vouch for that. (Laughs)",
        "INS Agent: And you'd know because...?",
        "Harley: Because I'm Bill's partner, and a proud U.S. Citizen.",
        "INS Agent: I thought Olivia was Bill's partner.",
        "Bill: Well, yeah. I mean... well, there's three of us. There's three partners.",
        "INS Agent: Well, I'll be in touch.",
        "Bill: I... sorry. In touch?",
        "INS Agent: To interview you and your wife together, see that everything is on the up and up.",
        "Bill: Hey, we're definitely on the up and up.",
        "INS Agent: Good. I hate it when I have to recommend criminal prosecution. It ruins my day.",
        "Bill: It would. So when would you be coming by?",
        "INS Agent: We like to pop in on people, see what life is like for the newlyweds. I'll see you soon. Nice meeting both of you.",
        "Bill: Great. Maybe Phillip and I can be roomies in the clink.",
        "Harley: Okay, Don't panic. You'll be fine. I told you that was a bad idea, but you'll be fine. Phillip will not be fine. And Sandy's awake at the hospital, so I'm going to go ask him if he remembers who the driver was that night. You want to come?",
        "Bill: Oh, my goodness. No. No, no, no, no, no. Do you mind going alone? Because I've got to go back to my place and, you know, clean it up a bit and make it look married.",

        "Cassie: Jeffrey had a picture of me in his safe?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. It was you and Richard. It was a nice picture.",
        "Edmund: It was a photo of you from back in your palace days.",
        "Cassie: That's weird. I don't care. I don't care. Danny, do me a favor. If you see Tammy, will you please tell her to call me?",
        "Danny: Yeah. Why? Is something wrong?",
        "Cassie: She just hasn't checked in.",
        "Dinah: And you've resorted to checking all the bars? Are you afraid she's drinking with that boyfriend of hers? Chip off the old block?",
        "Edmund: Come on, Cassie, let's go.",
        "Dinah: Is that how you got started? I mean, I know that none of us here are taking off our clothes or anything...",
        "Cassie: Let me tell you something, Dinah.",
        "Edmund: Come on, Cassie. Don't.",
        "Cassie: You better stay away from my daughter. You know what, Danny? Do yourself a favor. Stay away from her. Let me tell you something...",
        "Danny: I'm a big boy.",
        "Cassie: When Michelle comes around, and she's going to, you do not want to be mixed up with Dinah. Think about it.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, Danny, I think you should think about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Just step aside now.",
        "Reva: No. No, no, no, no, no. No. Not until you calm down. Please.",
        "Josh: I'm going to wipe that smirk off your face.",
        "Reva: I'm fine. I'm fine, I am. He didn't set out to do any real harm.",
        "Josh: Yeah, he didn't set out to do any real harm to Tammy, either, okay?",
        "Jonathan: Oh, wow. Hey, you got my number.",
        "Josh: Shut up! Reva has a big heart. She can't see anything other than forgiving you, but I'm different. I see the destruction that you have caused to this family. I see a spoiled, snotty-nosed little brat standing before me right now, some kid who thinks, \"oh, life was so tough, now I can hurt anybody I want to hurt.\" Have you taken one moment, have you stopped to think about what it meant to her? How it hurt her?",
        "Reva: Joshua...",
        "Josh: Reva? He's got to hear this. She... she had to make a choice and she could have made a selfish choice, but she didn't. She made the selfless choice. It practically killed her to give up her baby, but she did it. You know why? Because it was the right thing to do. It was the best thing to do for you. And then she went through a difficult period in her life, a difficult... a period where she had no memory whatsoever, but when she remembered you, when she discovered you again, all of those feelings she had for that little boy that she was forced to throw away, to give up, they all came flooding back to her, and she had to find you. She had to see you. And we did that. We visited you when you were, what, six, seven years old. Do you remember that?",
        "Jonathan: Does it matter?",
        "Josh: Obviously not to you. But yes, it mattered. Because then she had to make another choice, a more difficult choice. We found you with a set of parents who seemed to love you and care about you. That's the way it seemed to us. The only parents you had ever known, and she could have torn you away from them and broken every heart in the room, but she chose not to do that. She chose to break one heart--her heart--for you. I know because I was there. I saw what it did to her. How dare you, now, come into this house, our home, and point your miserable finger at her? She is the best thing that ever happened to you.",
        "Jonathan: Do you... do you have any beer in the fridge?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Sandy, there's a secret I've been keeping for a long time. I just can't do it anymore. It's too hard.",
        "Sandy: I know what you mean. First it seems like It's nothing, but it grows, and before you know it, it ruins your whole life.",
        "Lizzie: And it haunts you.",
        "Sandy: And you wonder, why did I even do this in the first place? And all you can think about is how much you wish you could just go back and erase the lie.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. And the guilt, it just won't go away.",
        "Sandy: I should just tell you. Everyone's going to know soon enough.",
        "Lizzie: Sandy? Tell me what?",
        "Sandy: I'm not really Reva's son. I'm just plain old Sandy foster. I knew Jonathan at boarding school, and I never thought I'd see him again, but he showed up.",
        "Lizzie: You mean he's in town?",
        "Sandy: Mm-hmm. And watch out for him. He goes by JB.",
        "Lizzie: What? There's no way.",
        "Sandy: I'm a fraud, a fake. The best thing I can do now is get out of town before anyone else gets hurt.",
        "Lizzie: Who's hurt, Sandy?",
        "Sandy: Just people. People I love. And if I would have just told the truth from the beginning, none of this would have happened and I could live with myself. I could... if I would have just told the truth.",
        "Lizzie: I wanted to tell the truth. They wouldn't let me. You have to believe me, Sandy.",
        "Sandy: What are you talking about?",
        "Lizzie: It's about what happened that night, the night of the accident.",
        "Harley: What about the accident, Lizzie?",

        "Danny: Want to get out of here?",

        "Danny: I'll just settle up.",
        "Dinah: Oh. He's a beaut.",
        "Danny: Yeah. Sometimes I just can't believe how lucky I am. He misses his mom. I don't know how I'm going to tell him that she's gone. It's going to break his heart. I just know that it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: You were about to say something about the night of the accident. What?",
        "Lizzie: I've just been hiding from everybody about how I feel about Sandy saving Tammy and, you know, I know everybody thinks that we hate each other, but I really do care about Tammy. And I owe it to you, I do, for pushing Tammy out of the way.",
        "Sandy: You should probably tell her that. She could use a friend right now.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I think I'll do that. Look, I really better go. It's getting late.",
        "Sandy: Hey, Lizzie? Thank you.",
        "Harley: So, Sandy, the car that hit you. Did you get a look at the driver?",
        "Sandy: Uh, no. It was really fast, and I was blinded by the headlights.",

        "Josh: Reva, I don't want him in this house.",
        "Jonathan: Well, you know, here I was expecting to get invited to dinner so, you know, Reva could give me my medical history.",
        "Josh: You want a medical history? I'll give you a medical history right now.",
        "Jonathan: Be careful. Be careful, buddy. My beef is with her. You don't want to make an enemy out of me.",
        "Josh: Get out, right now.",
        "Jonathan: I'm glad to know where we stand, Mr. Lewis. I'll be seeing you, Mom.",
        "Reva: No, Jonathan. Jonathan, wait. Just wait outside and I'll talk to him. I'll talk to him... (door slams) I know. I know he seems like a lost cause, but you have to just think about what he's been through.",
        "Josh: Reva, all I can think about right now is what he's going to put you through. And you know I can't let that happen.",
        "Reva: Well, I can handle it. I owe him. I do. I mean, he's had nothing. He's had no one. And I feel like if I can just spend some time with him and talk to him...",
        "Josh: No. No! It's too late for that. Isn't that obvious? Reva, if you don't send him packing right now and end this right now, that's it. You and I are done talking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: What are we going to do? Where else do we look? Who else do we call? We've called everyone. What kind of mother am I? My daughter is out there probably crying her eyes out somewhere and what am I doing? I'm trying to fight Dinah in a bar. I am the world's worst mother.",
        "Edmund: No, Cassie, you're not. You are not.",
        "Cassie: And what about that crack she made, you know? About Tammy out drinking somewhere with her boyfriend. I mean, how would she know anything about... because she saw them together before. Edmund, she knew.",
        "Edmund: She knew what?",
        "Cassie: That night, that night that JB took Tammy to your place, Dinah stopped me outside the door. She practically steered me away. She knew Tammy was inside with that creep. Oh, my God! I could have stopped them.",
        "Edmund: Cassie...",
        "Cassie: I could have stopped them. Because of Dinah...",
        "Edmund: Cassie, come on.",
        "Cassie: Oh, no. No, this makes sense. Dinah is always trying to get to me, and now she's done it through Tammy. So many things have happened to me because of Dinah. No, It's because of Dinah. Tammy's life is ruined because of Dinah. I know it.",
