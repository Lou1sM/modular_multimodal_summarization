        "Reva: Good-bye, sun. Good-bye day. Good-bye lake. Good-bye everybody I love. Good-bye Springfield! No tears tonight. Before I take my last drive, I am\r\ngoing to party like it's my last day on earth. ",
        "",
        "Billy: Why does that have to be tonight? Why\r\ncan't we wait a couple of weeks and get Marah and Shayne here and have\r\nourselves a real party. ",
        "Reva: You mean why not wait until Thanksgiving\r\nrolls around? ",
        "Billy: That's good. That's even better. ",
        "Reva: Well, because... it has to be like\r\nthis, Billy. I'm getting weaker by the hour, and I have to have the strength to\r\npush the pedal to the meddle and drive off that\r\nbridge, right? There. So handsome. ",
        "Billy: Reva, I-- ",
        "Reva: No. Come on, just help me with this.\r\nHelp me get through this party tonight. I want to leave everyone with a memory\r\nof me dancing and drinking and living life to the max. You know, not sick and\r\nweak and dying of breast cancer. ",
        "Billy: You don't realize how hard this is. I\r\nmean, you want me to go to this party and pretend I'm having fun, and the whole\r\ntime I'm going to be thinking about what's happening afterwards. ",
        "Reva: Just do this. Prop me up tonight,\r\nplease. It's my last request, okay? ",
        "",
        "Valet: Sweet little ride you got there, Mrs.\r\nLewis. I'll keep it nice and safe for you. ",
        "Reva: Thanks, Christian. Do me a favor and\r\nkeep it close to the front door. I may need it. ",
        "Valet: You plan on making an early exit? ",
        "Reva: You bet. My rabbit's\r\nfoot? ",
        "Billy: I'll look for it. ",
        "Reva: No. I don't need it. Thank you. Hey! ",
        "Guests: Hey! ",
        "Reva: You call this a party! Rick, I'm so\r\nglad you could make it. ",
        "Rick: Thanks, Reva. ",
        "Reva: And Harley, Gus, you both seem so happy tonight. \r\n",
        "Gus: Well, it's a party. ",
        "Reva: Yes, it damn well better be. ",
        "Harley: Okay, I have to say I'm confused\r\nbecause I'm seeing champagne and then fancy hors d'oeuvres... ",
        "Gus: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Harley: And over there... ",
        "Gus: There was a keg. We saw the keg and the\r\nribs. ",
        "Reva: We like to refer to it as Oklahoma fabulous. \r\n",
        "Harley: Hey, that's what we call you! ",
        "Reva: That's the idea. ",
        "Harley: Reva, how can you leave us? How can\r\nyou leave Springfield? ",
        "Reva: Hey, I'm just making room for you,\r\ndoll, so you can be the tough broad in town. Excuse me. Hey. Hi, Buzz. (Buzz \r\ngrumbling) \r\n",
        "Reva: (Screams) ",
        "Buzz: Oh, my God. ",
        "Reva: You a wild man, you. (Laughing) Did I get you? I'm so sorry. \r\n",
        "Buzz: You're a wild woman. ",
        "Reva: Yeah, I know. ",
        "Buzz: You're off a to\r\nanother adventure. ",
        "Reva: Well, yeah, as usual. You know, that's\r\nme, never a dull moment. I'm glad you're here. ",
        "Olivia: Thanks for inviting me. ",
        "Reva: Well, you know, were a part of my life\r\nhere-- were and here a part, in Springfield. I mean... ",
        "Frank: Hey. ",
        "Reva: Oh, Frank, hey. ",
        "Frank: Hi. ",
        "Reva: Hey, honey, I hope you left that badge\r\nof yours at home. ",
        "Frank: Absolutely. ",
        "Reva: ... So you can have some fun tonight. You gorgeous man.\r\n",
        "Jeffrey: Hi, Reva. I've always had a\r\nweakness for that face. ",
        "Blake: Yeah, I see this is why he gets the\r\nfemale vote. ",
        "Reva: No politicking tonight, okay?\r\nTonight's about fun! So everybody drink and dance and have a good time, okay?\r\nTurn up the music! Dance, everybody! Come on! Olivia, Buzz? ",
        "Jeffrey: You never do anything half way, do\r\nyou, Reva. ",
        "Reva: Well, now, what would be the point of\r\nthat? ",
        "Jeffrey: For the record, I'm going to miss\r\nthis face. So, here's to seeing you again real soon. ",
        "Reva: I'll see you when I see you. (Glasses clink) \r\n",
        "Blake: You make this sound like it is\r\npermanent. ",
        "Reva: Nothing's permanent, Blake. That's why\r\nyou have to live in the moment, right, Billy? ",
        "Billy: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Reva: Enjoy every sip of champagne and every\r\nlittle piggy in every blanket. ",
        "Billy: Whatever you say. Let me tell you\r\nsomething, it doesn't really matters who wins the election, but you have to\r\npromise me whoever does is going to take care of this crazy little town.\r\nBecause you know, it's about the people. I mean it's about-- not buildings and\r\njust a bunch of old streets. It's about the people. That's what makes the town\r\nso special. ",
        "Billy: I think we've had just a little too\r\nmuch champagne. ",
        "Reva: Yeah, I think so, too. ",
        "Billy: What do you think? She gets a little\r\nsentimental when she drinks. ",
        "Blake: She does? ",
        "Billy: Yeah. Hey, why don't you try some of\r\nthough shrimp puffs. They're real good. ",
        "Jeffrey: Do you think Reva\u2019s trying a little\r\ntoo hard? ",
        "",
        "Reva: Where's Mel? ",
        "Rick: Where's Mel, that's a good question.\r\nWhere's Mel? Mel? ",
        "Reva: I'm sorry about what Jonathan did and\r\nabout what you did. ",
        "Rick: Reva, please I just... ",
        "Reva: I'm not going to judge you, but I do\r\nhave some advice. Life's too short to waste any minute of it feeling sorry for yourself. \r\n",
        "Rick: Thank you, Dr. Reva. I feel so much\r\nbetter. ",
        "Reva: Hey, you're living with Gus and Harley\r\nnow. Maybe she can whip you into shape, huh? ",
        "Rick: Actually, I think Gus and Harley have\r\nother things on their mind. ",
        "Reva: Really? ",
        "Rick: I'm not supposed to say anything. It's\r\njust uh... ",
        "Reva: Come on, you can't-- ",
        "Rick: They just found out. Don't tell\r\nanybody. ",
        "",
        "Harley: (Laughs) ",
        "Gus: Is this like a little wedding or\r\nsomething? ",
        "Harley: I know,\r\nit's like a wedding. ",
        "Gus: How long is she going away for? ",
        "Harley: I don't know. Reva, she loves to\r\nparty. ",
        "Reva: Hey, you two. ",
        "Gus: Hey. ",
        "Reva: It's just great. ",
        "Harley: What? ",
        "Reva: You're pregnant! ",
        "Harley and Gus: Shh! ",
        "Harley: How did you find out? ",
        "Reva: Well, you know. ",
        "Gus: Do you think I should get over there\r\nand make sure it doesn't get on the P.A. or something? ",
        "Harley: Why don't you do that. ",
        "Reva: That's really great. The circle of\r\nlife, I guess. ",
        "Harley: Are you all right? ",
        "Reva: Yes, I'm fine. ",
        "Harley: You sure, because you seem a little\r\nemotional. ",
        "Reva: Yeah, I get emotional. I'm a little\r\nemotional. You know, you talk about babies. That's what happens. Just promise\r\nme something, that you'll make sure that Susan\u2019s a part of the baby's life. You\r\nknow, I feel bad she hasn't been around all that much, but she should be a part\r\nof the family-- yours and mine. ",
        "Harley: Of course, of course. ",
        "Reva: I mean, I\r\nhaven't even been able to spend much time with her. I feel bad about that. \r\n",
        "Harley: Oh, gosh, me either. ",
        "Reva: Give her my love, okay? ",
        "Harley: I will. ",
        "Reva: Oh, look. Excuse me. That's your big\r\nbrother looking so lonely over here. Hey, you, where's your date, pal? You are\r\nmuch too cute and too nice to be single, Frank. ",
        "Frank: I'm working on it. I've been on a few\r\ndates. (Olivia laughing) ",
        "Reva: Yeah. Well, you know what? She does\r\nthat with everyone. I just hope she doesn't hurt Buzz, too. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, you and me both. But uh... you\r\nmind if I ask you a question? I mean, why did you invite her? I mean the\r\nhistory between you two is... ",
        "Reva: Life is too short to bear grudges, Frank,\r\ntruly. You take care of yourself, okay? Be happy. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, you, too, Reva. ",
        "Reva: Ooh, there's my kids.\r\nHi, you two. Now the party can really start. Look at you, you're getting so\r\nbig. ",
        "Lizzie: Oh, great. ",
        "Reva: No. It's beautiful. It's just-- hello,\r\nlittle baby. So, I'm glad you two could be here. ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, blood pressure is pretty\r\ngood, pretty normal. ",
        "Reva: Ah, that's good. I'm glad to hear it. ",
        "Lizzie: Granddad has great timing. What is\r\nhe doing here? ",
        "Reva: Well I thought I should try to make\r\nnice before I kick the bucket. ",
        "Lizzie: That is not going to happen for a\r\nvery long time. Miracles do happen, Reva. ",
        "Reva: I'm glad you got yours. Hey, why don't\r\nyou go say hello to your granddaddy. Go on. ",
        "Lizzie: Really? ",
        "Reva: Yes. ",
        "Lizzie: Okay. ",
        "Reva: How about some fresh air? ",
        "Jonathan: I saw the car. ",
        "Reva: Oh? ",
        "Jonathan: Tonight? ",
        "Reva: Hey, why not tonight? You know,\r\nchampagne, lots of champagne, dancing. I give everybody a hug and then I go off\r\ninto the sunset, and don't you dare try to stop me. ",
        "Jonathan: I told you, I won\u2019t. I get it, I really do, but not now. \r\n",
        "Reva: Sweetie, lighten up. It has to be\r\ntonight. My mind is made up. But I don't know how I'm going to say good-bye to\r\nyou. I just found you. I just got to know you and love you and now... now,\r\nlook. I have you drinking champagne! You're a regular class act now. ",
        "Jonathan: Well, I still like beer better. ",
        "Reva: Yeah, me, too. To\r\nus. (Glasses clink) ",
        "Jonathan: Us. ",
        "Reva: Okay, now, you go back in there and\r\nyou play the loving hubby in front of Alan just a little while longer so you\r\nand Tammy can be together again. ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, about Tammy... ",
        "Reva: Yeah, where is she anyway? ",
        "Jonathan: I wouldn't know. ",
        "Reva: What's wrong? ",
        "Jonathan: Big changes. I decided I'm going\r\nto stay married to Lizzie even after the baby is born. ",
        "Reva: Yeah, for a few months I guess. Longer? ",
        "Jonathan: Mm-hmm. As in me\r\nand Tammy broke up. ",
        "Reva: No. No, no. You love Tammy. ",
        "Jonathan: Not your call. ",
        "Reva: This is all wrong. Jonathan, you and Tammy...\r\n",
        "Jonathan: Reva, it's not your problem\r\nanymore. Okay? You're going to be gone. The rest of us need to move on. ",
        "",
        "Reva: Hey! Hi, Alan. ",
        "Alan: Hello, Reva. You're not stoned\r\ntonight, are you? Because I didn't bring any breadsticks. ",
        "Jonathan: Oh, that is very funny. ",
        "Reva: You know, all that bullying, buster,\r\nis only going to leave you alone, like you are right now. ",
        "Alan: I appreciate your concern, but I'm not\r\nalone. ",
        "Reva: Really? You have a loveless marriage.\r\nYour sons despise you. And those are the ones you haven't shot. Now you have a\r\ngranddaughter who would rather raise her baby with this guy, than have anything\r\nto do with you. You want me to keep going? ",
        "Alan: I came here for one reason: To see you\r\ndrive off to God knows where with your lush of a boyfriend to find yourself\r\nonce again. What is this, about your 50th time? ",
        "Billy: Why don't you shut up, Alan. ",
        "Reva: No, it's okay. He likes to hear\r\nhimself talk. ",
        "Alan: I'm sorry that your marriage to Josh\r\ndidn't worked out again. You made a mess of that. Of\r\ncourse, he's found comfort in the arms of your sister. How do you celebrate?\r\nYou celebrate by running off like the coward that you are. But let me tell you\r\nsomething, this is what I have to say about that: Bon voyage. Because life in Springfield will go on living happily after,\r\nas well as your granddaughter. ",
        "Jonathan: Get out now! ",
        "Frank: Jonathan. Jonathan! Jonathan. ",
        "Reva: No. Come here. Sweetie, thank you.\r\nThanks for defending me, but I don't need it. Because you will still be here,\r\nand I will need you because once I'm gone, you damn well better do right by Lizzie\r\nand Jonathan\u2019s little baby girl because if you don't as God as my witness, I\r\nwill come back and I will haunt you. ",
        "Alan: Haunt me? ",
        "Reva: Hunt you. Hunt you. I will come back\r\nand I will hunt you down if you do anything to hurt my family. Do you\r\nunderstand me? ",
        "Billy: Okay. Hey, hey, where's the music? I\r\nthought this was supposed to be a party. Let's dance! Come on! Do you want to\r\ndo me a favor and take Lizzie out on the dance floor? ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Come on. (Music playing) ",
        "Reva: Tammy. ",
        "Tammy: Hi. Wow, it looks like a great party.\r\n",
        "Reva: Hey, excuse me. Pour me some\r\nchampagne, please. Thanks. I'm sorry. Jonathan told me everything. ",
        "Tammy: It's okay. Really, I'm fine. ",
        "Reva: No, you're not. And neither is he. ",
        "Tammy: He will be with time. I really want Jonathan\r\nto feel good about himself, and the only way that is\r\ngoing to happen is if he's able to be there for his daughter. Let's not talk\r\nabout it anymore, okay, because tonight is about you. ",
        "Reva: I was just going to say that you have\r\ngotten to be so grown up, and I only wish there was a way that I could be\r\naround to see what a fabulous young woman you're going to become or that you\r\nare. ",
        "Tammy: Well I know a way,\r\ntake me with you, wherever you're going. I mean it. Waiting around here and\r\nwatching Jonathan and Lizzie happily ever after... ",
        "Reva: Tammy. Did you see the car out front?\r\nDid you see that little red sports car? It's a two-seater. It's only big enough\r\nfor Billy and me and the rest of our junk. Besides that, I don't think the Tammy\r\nand Jonathan story is over quite yet. And somewhere down\r\nthe line... ",
        "Tammy: No. It's over. It has to be. ",
        "Reva: You will meet someone, somebody who\r\nwill be free to love you the way you deserve to be loved. ",
        "Tammy: I don't know, Aunt Reva. What if we\r\nonly get one love in our lives. One true love, I mean.\r\nHow do you let go of that? ",
        "",
        "Reva: Welcome, you guys. Oh! So, come, have\r\na drink on me. ",
        "",
        "Waiter: Sir, champagne? ",
        "Billy: Ah, no, no, thanks. ",
        "Buzz: Boy, just when I thought I had it\r\nfigured out? ",
        "Billy: Yeah. ",
        "Buzz: I thought she would rather die than\r\nwalk away from Josh. What? Now, I think it's good\r\nshe's with you. ",
        "Billy: Hey, look, when it comes to the\r\nconnection between Josh and Reva, I'm an expert. And believe me,\r\nI don't think there is anything that is going to break it, not even-- ",
        "Buzz: Not even what? ",
        "Billy: That's sports car. I just put out\r\nserious cash for that thing, and I think it is worth it-- ",
        "Gus: You know, if you're buying anybody else\r\na present, I'm available, too. ",
        "Jeffrey: Me, too. ",
        "Frank: That's the turbo model. ",
        "Billy: Oh, yeah. V-6, 300 horses, 2.9, I\r\nmean it's loaded. ",
        "",
        "Reva: You know,\r\nit's like the only thing Billy can talk about is that car. It's like he is 16\r\nagain. ",
        "Cassie: Yeah, you still haven't told us\r\nwhere you're going yet, Reva? ",
        "Reva: Well that's because you don't know\r\nyet. We're just going to hit the road and see where it takes us. ",
        "",
        "Lizzie: You okay? ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. It's just harder than I\r\nthought it would be. ",
        "Lizzie: Because Tammy\u2019s here? ",
        "Jonathan: No.. let's go. I told Reva we'd have fun. Let's go dance. \r\n",
        "Lizzie: Okay. ",
        "",
        "Reva: Did Tammy tell you about her and Jonathan?\r\n",
        "Cassie: Yeah, that he's decided to make the\r\nmarriage work. I feel awful for Tammy, but I somehow respect Jonathan for that.\r\n",
        "Reva: Yeah, me, too. But it's really tough\r\non him. And her, too. ",
        "Reva: You have two have to promise me you'll\r\nlook after both of them after-- doing the right thing isn't always easy. ",
        "Josh: We'll look after both of them, I mean,\r\nuntil you and Billy get bored of whatever your doing\r\nand decide to come home. ",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, if we do. ",
        "Josh: What, you never will? ",
        "Reva: Well, who knows, we may find our own\r\nparadise. ",
        "Josh: Right. You once told me that paradise\r\nexists at home, I think. ",
        "Reva: I never said that. I wouldn't ever say\r\nanything so corny. ",
        "Josh: No, but it was Christmas time. And at Christmas\r\nyou're allowed to be corny. Hey, maybe that's where the dream-thing came from? \r\n",
        "Reva: What dream? ",
        "Cassie: He had this really weird dream about\r\nyou. ",
        "Josh: It was Christmas time, and we were at Cross\r\nCreek, and the whole family was going to be there. ",
        "Reva: Well that's nice. ",
        "Josh: Well, yeah, it was nice until you\r\nsuddenly got this strange look on your face. You looked very afraid and you\r\nsaid something like please, Bud, help me and I looked down and there was a set\r\nof car keys. And then I woke up. Go figure.",
        "Cassie: And we couldn't figure out what the\r\nheck it meant, but... now you think what? ",
        "Josh: Well, I'm just saying that maybe\r\nthere's a part of you, Reva, that doesn't really want to leave and I picked up\r\non it. I mean, I think that would make some sense, wouldn't it? ",
        "Billy: Hey. ",
        "Reva: Hi. ",
        "Josh: Reva. ",
        "Cassie: Are you all right? ",
        "Billy: I think the party is just wearing on\r\nyou a little bit. ",
        "Reva: Well, nothing that another glass of\r\nchampagne won't fix. Look, there they are. There's Pop and Rusty. Hey, you two\r\num... you all enjoy yourselves. Hi. Oh, it's so good to see you. I'm glad you\r\ncould come. It means so much to me. ",
        "Hawk: This party makes no sense to me, but\r\nthen neither does the notion of your just handing Josh over to Cassie on a\r\nsilver platter, and taking up with Billy Lewis, of all people. ",
        "Rusty: Don't mind him,\r\nhe's just in one of those moods. Would you stop being so\r\ngrumpy? ",
        "Hawk: Would you stop telling me what to do?!\r\n",
        "Reva: Hey. ",
        "Rusty: Did I lie? ",
        "Reva: Come on, Pop. What's done is done.\r\nDon't blame this on Cassie. She's had a tough life. She's had it tough enough\r\nas it is. So just cut her some slack or else. ",
        "Hawk: I'm not saying that Cassie doesn't\r\ndeserve some happiness, but does it have to be with Josh? That man was meant\r\nfor you since the moment you first laid eyes on him, Reva. ",
        "Reva: Rusty go have\r\nsome fun. Come here, you. I have a little something to tell you. ",
        "Hawk: What? ",
        "Reva: There's a part of Josh that will\r\nalways be mine, just like I will always be his. And that is something that I'm\r\ngoing to take with me to my grave. ",
        "Hawk: Oh, that will do you a lot of good.\r\nHe'll never love anybody the way he does you, girl. You are one-of-a-kind. Oh,\r\ngreat jumping gophers, you're squeezing the life out of me. (Laughing) ",
