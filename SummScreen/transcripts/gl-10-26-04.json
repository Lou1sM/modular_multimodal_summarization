        "Tony: This thing is broken. I unplugged it to try to fix it, but the damn thing is dead.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, of course. Of course it's dead. All right, look. Tony, we've got to find our way to shore somehow. We've got to get docked somewhere. We've got to find Holly.",
        "Tony: Why did he take her, Michelle? What does he want with your dad?",
        "Michelle: I don't know. I don't know. I don't even remember my father.",
        "Tony: Well, I'm telling you, you have to know something or else you wouldn't have come down here in the first place.",
        "Michelle: Tony, all I know is Sebastian's father, Roger Thorpe, hated my dad. Maybe he wants revenge. Maybe that's why he's holding Holly, to get it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: Room 302. Good work, Sebastian. This room, this hotel, where I was hiding from Roger, a long time ago.",
        "Sebastian: And where he found you.",
        "Holly: He hunted me down. I was his prey. What are you doing?",
        "Sebastian: I told you, Holly, I was going to lead you back into your past.",
        "Holly: Yes, you did. But I never said I would follow you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Well, if it isn't my intrepid nephew. Oh, right. Wrong again. You don't belong here.",
        "Sandy: I know. But I came to talk about Tammy.",
        "Edmund: Really? Because your lies left her vulnerable to Jonathan, so I'm not interested in anything you have to say. Get out of here.",
        "Cassie: No. I want you to stay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Tammy, I've been looking everywhere for you. I can't believe it, what we did.",
        "Tammy: You mean, what you did. I can't even look at you.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy, please. Please. When I first saw you, I knew that you were someone that I had to know. I knew you were someone... I don't know. Look, we started hanging out, spending time together and I just wanted to be with this beautiful, amazing girl. Look, I admit I hate Reva for what she did to me, but I don't hate you. Please, Tammy, you're the best thing that's ever happened to me.",
        "Tammy: Just one thing.",
        "Jonathan: Anything. Anything.",
        "Tammy: Did you know? I want to hear you say it. Did you know we were cousins?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: This is not the time for some misplaced sense of guilt. Reva, you can't possibly believe that you could reach Jonathan.",
        "Reva: Why not?",
        "Josh: Because... for one thing, he had his hands around your throat when I walked into the room a little while ago, Reva. Who knows what he would have done if I hadn't shown up.",
        "Reva: He's angry, Joshua, and desperate.",
        "Josh: You think? Reva, Jonathan came here to Springfield to get even with you in any way he possibly can.",
        "Reva: We don't know that.",
        "Josh: This is not the infant you left behind! This is not the boy that you went to visit, that you've been dreaming about! Look, Edmund was going to kill him and you saved his life.",
        "Reva: And what kind of a life was it? I mean, really. Knowing all that has happened, do you expect me to just leave him be who he is and not try to help him? What kind of a mother is that? He deserves more than that from his mother.",
        "Josh: Yeah, well, he's not going to get it.",
        "Reva: Don't dictate terms to me.",
        "Josh: You are not a family of one. You cannot see him anymore. I forbid it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: We can leave right now, Holly, if you want, but I'm telling you, if you do not go in that room, you are going to regret it for the rest of your life. You will always be afraid.",
        "Holly: You're very good at this.",
        "Sebastian: I know.",
        "Holly: So, this is what Roger wanted me to do? Face the ugly memories.",
        "Sebastian: Head on.",
        "Holly: Yeah? Most people want you to remember the good when they're gone.",
        "Sebastian: You're afraid.",
        "Holly: Yes, I am. Maybe I like it. Maybe I like it. Maybe it helps me move forward. Maybe I like waking up in the middle of the night remembering all the terrible things he did to me.",
        "Sebastian: No, I don't think so. I don't believe you. Let him go, Holly, and let me help you. That's why I'm here.",
        "Holly: You're my own personal guru? On a mission from a sad, lonely, dying man? It's a little late, Roger.",
        "Sebastian: You and I both know that you are going into that room, because you're braver than you think you are.",
        "Holly: I haven't always been good at facing my fears, not always knowing if they were real.",
        "Sebastian: I won't let anything happen to you, I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You lied to us.",
        "Sandy: Look, I'm not going to try and excuse anything I did. There is no excuse. All I can do is apologize, and I'm sorry. But I'm not important. I came to talk about Tammy. When she came to the hospital...",
        "Edmund: She came to the hospital?",
        "Cassie: When?",
        "Edmund: How long ago was this?",
        "Sandy: Earlier tonight. And she was so upset--so upset--and she could have ripped my head off, which I probably deserve...",
        "Edmund: Did she say where she was going?",
        "Sandy: No.",
        "Cassie: Okay, we've got to go. We've got to go. We're going to take two cars and...",
        "Edmund: Cassie. Cassie.",
        "Cassie: I have to find Tammy.",
        "Edmund: She will be back here when she's ready.",
        "Sandy: If you want me to go out, I'll go look for her and call you to let you know if she's okay.",
        "Edmund: All right, fine. All right.",
        "Cassie: I want to hate you--and maybe I do hate you--but that's not going to do me any good right now.",
        "Sandy: No. Right now, what's important is finding Tammy and stopping Jonathan.",
        "Edmund: Well, on that one thing, I think we agree.",
        "Cassie: I need to know one thing. Was it real? Any of the time you spent with my family?",
        "Sandy: Are you kidding me? It was all real. I dove in front of that car to save Tammy, and I would do it again. There's nothing I wouldn't do for her, for Reva, for any of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Why does it matter what anyone else thinks? Who could matter as much as us?",
        "Tammy: Touch me again and you're dead.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy, don't.",
        "Tammy: Don't what? Let you weasel your way back into my life?",
        "Jonathan: Look, Tammy, you have a lot of people poisoning your mind against me right now, but you know me. You know me better than anyone else. You're the only person that's ever seen the real me.",
        "Tammy: Aunt Reva must have known what you were from the minute you were born. She didn't give you up to protect you. She wanted you as far away from her as you could get.",
        "Jonathan: Hey. I was going to take it easy on you, you stupid, spoiled little brat. Look, you blame it on me if you want, but think about how easy it was for me to get you in the sack. Did you care who I was, Tammy? No. No. You were ripe. And I just wanted to be the first one in line to pick the fruit.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Look, I understand, I really do, how much you want to make a difference in this boy's life.",
        "Reva: He's my son. You know, when you keep saying that, you keep referring to him as \"this kid\" or \"that boy.\" He's my son. Just like Marah and Shayne and Dylan are my children, Jonathan's my child.",
        "Josh: Okay, all right. Fine. What are you going to do when he hurts somebody again? Because it's going to happen, you know that.",
        "Reva: Maybe. I'm just trying to hold on to the little bit that I knew of him. And if there's more to him, then I'd like to try to reach it.",
        "Josh: No. Reva, I'm telling you right now, if you cannot or will not kick this kid out of our lives, then I'm going to do it for you.",
        "Reva: And what is that going to do to us?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: I'm remembering every detail. Chrissy and I running for our lives, hiding. And I kept trying to make a game of it so she couldn't tell how terrified I was. There was a knock on the door. Room service. It was the waiter. But no, it was Roger.",
        "Sebastian: And he kidnapped you.",
        "Holly: No, he tried to take her, and I pushed her through the door and I begged him, \"no, take me instead.\" And he put the gun... I can't do this. I can't go through with it. I thought I could. I've got to get out... I've got to get out of this room. (Screams)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Okay, you know, you've been right about everything all along.",
        "Tony: Ah. What was that?",
        "Michelle: You heard me. Oh.",
        "Tony: Okay.",
        "Michelle: Um, okay, what was that?",
        "Tony: Maybe just the wake from a tanker, or...",
        "Michelle: Or what? Or what? What are you doing?",
        "Tony: I am checking the barometer, okay?",
        "Michelle: You know how to read a barometer all of a sudden?",
        "Tony: You know something? I'm going to start collecting IOU's for every time that you underestimate me. All right? It measures air pressure. When there's a rise or a fall of more than seven hecto-pascals in a 24-hour period, then you know there's trouble.",
        "Michelle: Or you could just look up at the sky.",
        "Tony: Well, I don't want to scare you, Michelle, but I did that, too.",
        "Michelle: And?",
        "Tony: And get ready to be seasick. All right? A storm's coming and we're going to be in for a wild ride.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Please believe me, Cassie. This family is important to me and it always will be.",
        "Cassie: How can you stand here and say that to me?",
        "Sandy: Because it's the truth.",
        "Cassie: You know, you're not going to remember this, but I came to visit you at the hospital one day and I felt so helpless because I wanted to do something for you, to show you how much you meant to us. I was at a loss. And then I realized there was something, there was one thing that I could give you that was so precious to me, and I knew that you were the one person who deserved to have it. And that was my engagement ring from Richard. So I told you that I was going to hold onto it for you and that one day, when you met the woman that you wanted to spend the rest of your life with, it would be yours to give her. Do you understand what it meant for me to make that promise to you? To want to give you something, the one thing I had from Richard?",
        "Sandy: I don't know how to say how sorry I am.",
        "Cassie: I think what you did was worse than what Jonathan did. Because you pretended to care about us and you made us care about you.",
        "Sandy: It wasn't pretend for me. I'll make up for this somehow, I swear.",
        "Edmund: Hey. I know things seem rather bleak right now, and they are. But we will weather this storm.",
        "Cassie: I'm just so worried about Tammy. I just wanted to keep her safe and I wanted to protect her like I never was.",
        "Edmund: You're protected now. And she will be. I'm going to make sure of that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I'm not afraid of you.",
        "Jonathan: Nothing to be afraid of. I'm very gentle, aren't I? Especially with the virgins.",
        "Tammy: You said all the right things and I fell for it. I could have listened to my family, and I didn't.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, well, you should have listened to your family. But, of course, your family is a joke. Reva falls for any guy with a tattoo and a sad story. Cassie is sleeping with her dead husband's brother, a guy who terrorized her for years, the same guy who tried to kill me.",
        "Tammy: Too bad he didn't get the chance.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Yeah, well, I guess I have Reva to thank for something. You know, you could blame Edmund for starting all this, but it would be kind of hard to be mad at him, since you had such a huge crush on the guy. Yeah, Lizzie Spaulding told me that one. And that's when I knew I could pull this off. You know, a girl who would have the hots for her uncle, you've got to figure she'd be up for pretty much everything.",
        "Tammy: Oh, shut your mouth. You are sick!",
        "Jonathan: Oh, I don't know, Tammy. I don't know. For a first timer, you were pretty demanding. Did I do anything you didn't ask me for? \"JB... JB, I just want to be everything you need. I just want to be touched.\" Did I touch you in all the right places?",
        "Tammy: (Screams)",
        "Jonathan: Oh, come on. You want to hit me? You want to hit me? Go ahead. But I will hit you back twice as hard. Everybody should know that about me by now.",
        "Tammy: I wish you were dead!",
        "Jonathan: Oh. I think you wish you were dead. Isn't that how it feels? Huh? Like you're dying inside? Welcome to my world. You're still wearing the necklace I gave you. That's sweet.",
        "Tammy: I need a shower. I need to wash you off of me.",
        "Jonathan: Uh-uh. Don't fool yourself, Tammy. You'll never be the same. I left my mark on you. But listen, if it makes you feel at all better, you weren't half bad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Nothing is going to happen between us because of Jonathan.",
        "Reva: It will if you keep issuing ultimatums.",
        "Josh: Reva, you have got to start seeing this situation for what it is. Your guilt is going to destroy you and then it's going to take down this family. And I can't let that happen!",
        "Reva: What if Marah and Shayne did something terrible? Would you turn your back on them?",
        "Josh: You know what? Marah and Shayne are not...",
        "Reva: What were you going to say? They're not monsters, animals? Your children. What if Jonathan was your son.",
        "Josh: He's not.",
        "Reva: Lucky for you, right? (Crying)",
        "Josh: I understand guilt. I have swallowed buckets of guilt over the last few decades. You did nothing wrong. You helped this boy. You understand that? You helped him. You put him with what you thought was a good family.",
        "Reva: Well, I was wrong.",
        "Josh: You didn't know.",
        "Reva: But I do now. I know what his life was like. Just think about what he's been through. You know, he shows up here, he sees Sandy with his mother living the life that he never got to have.",
        "Josh: That wasn't your fault either.",
        "Reva: Yeah, but I can't walk away from it, okay. I can't just leave him to suffocate in his own pain without at least trying to help. If I did that, what kind of a mother would I be?",
        "Josh: Reva, Jonathan is sick. He's a sick young man. He needs professional help. He doesn't need turkey dinners and home movies and a birthday cakes from you, okay? Now I know this is hard for you, but we have to do everything we can to protect this family. And the only way we could protect this family is to cut Jonathan and Sandy, for that matter, out of our lives forever!",
        "Sandy: He's right. You'd be crazy if you didn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Tammy. Oh, honey, I was so worried about you.",
        "Tammy: I'm fine, mom.",
        "Cassie: Where have you been?",
        "Tammy: I saw JB",
        "Cassie: Did he hurt you?",
        "Tammy: There's nothing he could do to me that he's hasn't already done.",
        "Cassie: Tammy, JB is a very dangerous person.",
        "Edmund: Tammy, I really don't think you should see him again.",
        "Tammy: All he did was tell me the truth. He said that I would never be able to forget him. No one ever forgets the first person they slept with, right?",
        "Cassie: Tammy.",
        "Tammy: Whatever. It doesn't matter whether I could forget him or not.",
        "Cassie: Why? What does that mean?",
        "Tammy: Everyone's looking at me. Talking about me behind my back, about how stupid I am and how sick it all is.",
        "Edmund: Tammy, I know how it feels to think that everywhere you turn people are judging you. But it doesn't matter what they think. The important thing is that you know this is not your fault.",
        "Tammy: No. It's yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Sandy, what are you doing here? You should be in the hospital.",
        "Sandy: I left. I just came to pack up my stuff and leave my key.",
        "Josh: Sandy, look...",
        "Sandy: I know. I'm not welcomed here. I just want to tell you that you're right. You should cut me out of your lives. And I want to tell you that I know what you're thinking what you're thinking with Jonathan, because you thought the same thing with me. And you can't save him. Jonathan and I were roommates in boarding school. We were friends. At first, I admired him because he's fearless and then I found out how messed up he is. And everything you're afraid that he might be, he is.",
        "Reva: Was he always this way?",
        "Sandy: As long as I've known him. And what he did with Tammy is just the start of his cruelty. He'll use anything he can against you. Especially your love, your heart.",
        "Josh: It took a lot of guts for you to come here. I respect that. But now it's time for you to go.",
        "Sandy: I'll go.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Sandy: This is the last thing I'll ever say to you. So I want you to please listen to me.",
        "Reva: Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait.",
        "Sandy: Don't try and save him.",
        "Reva: Wait. What do you mean it's the last thing you'll ever say?",
        "Sandy: Reva, I'm leaving.",
        "Reva: For how long?",
        "Sandy: Forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: Sorry about that. She... you... she thought you were someone else.",
        "Waiter: My apologies, madam.",
        "Holly: You set me up. You knew he looked like Roger. You just wanted to see me jump.",
        "Sebastian: I arranged for dinner, Holly. I did not arrange our waiter to resemble my father.",
        "Holly: So what is all this? Candlelight, gardenias. What is this? What are you doing?",
        "Sebastian: To your liking? And something a little bit more comfortable for you. I'm just following his instructions, Holly. He... he wrote this for you. \"My beloved, Holly, I am not here in body, but in spirit I am right by side every step of the way. Please, please forgive me for the violent way that evening ended up long time ago. It should have been like this. A beautiful dinner, a beautiful night, and a beautiful you. Sadly, I am nearing the end and I've only just come to realize that the only good part of me was you.\" So it's time to let go, Holly. And it's time for you to allow me to help you return to your peace of spirit, your peace of mind and your peace of heart.",
        "Holly: I don't know what to do now.",
        "Sebastian: Get dressed. Join me for dinner.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tony: All right, well, the winds picking up. Swells are getting higher. Can you tell?",
        "Michelle: Yeah. Yeah, I noticed. Tony, how bad is this going to get?",
        "Tony: Worst-case scenario? One: Michelle, we're crushed. Two: We capsize. And three: We... (Michelle screams)",
        "Tony: Okay. All right. You okay?",
        "Michelle: Okay, I get it. I get it, all right?",
        "Tony: Get what? Huh?",
        "Michelle: Is there any chance that this captain is going to come back for us?",
        "Tony: Not in seas like this. I'm sorry. It's okay. Listen to me. You're doing great. All right, we're going to make through this. I promise you. Everything is going to be fine.",
        "Michelle: Tony, be honest with me, all right. Are we really going to make it through this?",
        "Tony: Michelle, yes, we're going to get through this, okay. Everything is going to be all right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: None of this would be happening right now if you hadn't tried to kill Jonathan when he was a baby.",
        "Cassie: Tammy, Jonathan is who is he is because...",
        "Edmund: Because of me. Because of me. She's right. And I'm not hardly taking responsibility this one. We can tap dance around this as much as we like, but she's right. Tammy, you're right. My ambition, my greed, my jealousy of my brother brought all of this about. And this family is still paying for everything that I did. But I love you, Tammy. And I want to do everything I can to make sure you get through this.",
        "Tammy: I don't even want to look at your face right now. Just leave me alone.",
        "Edmund: All right, I could do that, too.",
        "Cassie: (Whispers) I'm sorry. Can I stay?",
        "Tammy: You all tried to warn me about him, but I didn't listen. All I could do was go on and on about how much I liked him, how wrong you all were about him.",
        "Cassie: You weren't wrong. JB lied to you. There's a difference.",
        "Tammy: At least when you took off your clothes at that strip bar you were trying to put food on the table. I let JB use me for nothing. Maybe I should have charged him. At least then I would have gotten something out of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: No, it's not that simple. Just because you're gone doesn't mean we're going to magically forget everything you've done to us.",
        "Sandy: I don't expect you to forget. I just hope that someday that you can manage to forgive me.",
        "Reva: No, you have to stick around here and you have to help clean up the mess you made.",
        "Sandy: There isn't a person in town who wouldn't want to punch my lights out if they saw me on the streets. If I stick around, seeing me will just get under people skin.",
        "Reva: What about the studio? (Crying) you're just going to leave me in the lurch?",
        "Sandy: I know what you're thinking, Reva. But it's best for you if I go. At least then you could have some peace.",
        "Reva: That sounds familiar. Almost rehearsed. Joshua.",
        "Sandy: I'm telling you that because that's how I feel.",
        "Reva: Well, I think somebody else feels the same way. What did you say to him?",
        "Sandy: Josh just told you do the decent thing and get lost. And he's right, Reva.",
        "Reva: What else did you tell him?",
        "Josh: I told him that if he doesn't do the right thing...",
        "Reva: According to you.",
        "Josh: If he doesn't do the right thing, I'll do everything I can to send him off to jail.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: You're not freaking out, right?",
        "Tony: Nah, not yet.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, me neither. Oh, I really hate being stuck here. I'm glad that I'm not alone.",

        "Michelle: What was that?",
        "Tony: Well, you do remember when I said worst case scenario, right?",
        "Michelle: Right, right. But you only told me the first two. You never said the third.",
        "Tony: Don't worry about it, Michelle. You stay here.",
        "Michelle: Tony, wait. Wait a minute.",
        "Tony: Just stay there. Stay there.",
        "Michelle: I'm not staying here alone. Tony?!",

        "Sebastian: Wow. You look stunning.",
        "Holly: Thank you.",
        "Sebastian: And it's good to see you smile for once.",
        "Holly: Hmm.",
        "Sebastian: Hmm.",
        "Holly: So, you know everything about me and I know nothing about you.",
        "Sebastian: Not much to tell.",
        "Holly: You expect me to be an open book and you don't reciprocate?",
        "Sebastian: I am sure your life is far more interesting than mine.",
        "Holly: Hard to believe.",
        "Sebastian: Well, you found most things about me hard to believe and yet they're still true.",
        "Holly: At least tell me what your life was like before Roger.",
        "Sebastian: I was searching like everyone else, I suppose. I was searching for something in life to matter.",
        "Holly: And you found it when you found Roger?",
        "Sebastian: That was the beginning, yeah. But I'm still searching. And yet I feel closer to finding it than ever before.",

        "Edmund: I'm sorry, I didn't order...",
        "JB: My treat. Did I ever tell you that you're my hero? You're thinking. But if you are hoping that there might... that something might happen between us...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: I'm not hoping for anything that you haven't already given me, Holly.",
        "Holly: I haven't given you anything.",
        "Sebastian: Yes, you have. You've given me your smile, you've given me your trust. Holly, you did all the work. It was my father's wish to release you from the pain that he gave you, the fear that he gave you in your life. And I just appreciate that you made me part of that. That I could help.",
        "Holly: Maybe it's the candles, but this room doesn't seem as scary as I remember it.",
        "Sebastian: Mm-hmm.",
        "Holly: It's like when you're a kid in bed when you see a monster in the corner and then the light changes and you realize it's a teddy bear with clothes on top of it.",
        "Sebastian: (Laughs) yeah. (Moans) you wanted to know something about me? I'm the kind of... I was the kind of kid that would march straight across that room in the dark just to see if the monster was real.",
        "Holly: I'm sure you were.",
        "Sebastian: And then I would pick up the teddy bear and rip off it's head for trying to scare me.",
        "Holly: (Laughs) okay.",
        "Sebastian: Just kidding. Just kidding. Just kidding.",
        "Holly: I think I should thank you for this opportunity. You were right. This is a chance to free myself from the past.",
        "Sebastian: Well, you are welcome. But it's not over, Holly. It's only the beginning.",
        "Holly: No, this... I thought this was it. I thought you said that coming into this room would be a way of letting go of the past.",
        "Sebastian: It is. But now the next chapter is embracing the future.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tony: Stay. I told you to stay in here. I told you...",
        "Michelle: I would never stay in here and drown alone, all right? What is going on, Tony? Tell me.",
        "Tony: Okay, fine. The anchor came free. The anchor which is broken.",
        "Michelle: What?",
        "Tony: I can't get it back down. All right, Michelle, now we may not... we may not sink, we may not die, but we may end up lost at sea. Here. I want you to stay warm. It's okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Get away from me while you still can.",
        "JB: You know, I thought you of all people would be able to have a little respect for what I've been able to accomplish so far.",
        "Edmund: You don't know the meaning of the word respect.",
        "JB: Oh, give me a break. How many people have you drop-kicked to get what you want out of life?",
        "Edmund: I'm a different person now.",
        "JB: Oh, I didn't know. I'm sorry. Have I offended you? Gosh, I must be pretty good. Offensive to an attempted baby killer.",
        "Edmund: Go. Now.",
        "JB: Hey, I bet looking at me is like looking into a mirror.",
        "Edmund: Hardly. And that's my fault, too. But I'll make my apologies to you later. Just remember this. We all make our own choices on the path to life. So be very careful which one you choose.",
        "JB: Be careful which choice I choose? Blah, blah. Thanks for the advice, Uncle Eddie. But we both know that life was laid out before me the second you wanted my blood. Reva kicked me to the curb and the guy who raised, well, he just kicked me. Hey, for the record, I know that you and Tammy almost had something a while back...",
        "Edmund: No.",
        "JB: And listen in case you were wondering, in the sack, she is unbelievable. Oh. Oh.",
        "Edmund: I should...",
        "JB: Go ahead! Go ahead! Go ahead! You never got the chance to kill your brother's son. I'm right here. Finish the job. Come on. But I'm not a baby anymore. Here's my blood, Uncle. Look like you haven't changed that much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I don't want to hear you ever talk about yourself like that again.",
        "Tammy: Why not? It's true. I'm dirty. I'm disgusting. When I think about being with him...",
        "Cassie: Only you have the power to change that, Tammy. Don't let him win. JB is garbage. And he lied to you.",
        "Tammy: So what if he lied to me? I deserved what I got.",
        "Cassie: No, no, you don't. No, you don't. Baby, you are so young. You're so young. And you just wanted to be in love. And you just wanted to feel love from someone and he took advantage of that.",
        "Tammy: When I saw him tonight, he said the worst things. Things I didn't even know anyone could say.",
        "Cassie: Listen to me. I want you to listen to the voice of someone who knows you. Okay, someone who knows how beautiful and how wonderful you are inside and out. And he can't touch that. Baby, I am never going to let you drown. Never.",

        "Reva: Now you've gone from ultimatums to threats. What's wrong with you?",
        "Josh: Reva, I respect what your heart is telling you to do, but--",
        "Reva: But what? You think it's a bad thing?",
        "Josh: Absolutely.",
        "Reva: That I want to have a relationship with my children?",
        "Josh: Sandy is not your child. And as far as Jonathan is concerned...",
        "Reva: I know he's not my son! But I don't appreciate you trying to run him out of town.",
        "Sandy: I'm not leaving because of Josh's threat. I'm leaving because it's the right thing to do.",
        "Reva: You don't have to do this, Sandy.",
        "Sandy: And I'm going to tell you one more thing before I go. I lied to you about a lot of things, but I never once lied about my feelings for you. You're the mom that I always wished I'd had. I guess that's why I couldn't stop lying. You know, I couldn't stand to lose this family.",
        "Josh: Even though it wasn't yours to begin with.",
        "Sandy: You see that's what you don't get, Josh. As long as you thought I as Jonathan, you were my family. And for someone like me, that's means a whole lot more than anything else.",
        "Josh: Hard-luck story, but it doesn't excuse what he did.",
        "Reva: Contrary to what you might think, I am not treating these boys like little stray puppies that I just found.",
        "Josh: Reva, right now you're following that big loving, confused, guilty heart of yours.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, it's my heart. It's my heart. And I'm going to follow it. You know I am.",
        "Josh: Reva, listen...",
        "Reva: And this is where we draw the line, okay. And don't even think that you could get between me and Jonathan. I left him once and it broke me in two. And it broke him in two. I'm not going to leave him a second time.",
