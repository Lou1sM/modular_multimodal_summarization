        "Dinah: This is going to be fun. This is going to be fun. We're like any other normal couple out on a regular date.",
        "Jeffrey: Normal? You've got quite an imagination, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: So do you, Jeffrey. Or have you stopped imagining that I'm Cassie when we're alone together? Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, forget that I said that. This is going to be a lovely evening and I don't want to do anything to ruin it, okay?",
        "Jeffrey: Lovely evening? What is this, a big night for you? We're having dinner, Dinah. I do this every night.",
        "Dinah: Yes, but dinner out in public, for everybody to see. We don't have to hide our relationship anymore, especially from Cassie.",
        "Jeffrey: We don't have a relationship, Dinah. You work for me. We get together from time to time. That's it.",
        "Dinah: Jeffrey, now, you know that it is more than that. You adore me. Which is why I've decided it's time.",
        "Dinah: Time for what?",
        "Dinah: Time to meet the folks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: What is that?",
        "Harley: It's Ruth's stuff. I can't get dressed at the boarding house. Between my father and Coop and Marina and Frank and the boys, we're all living out of one bathroom. You can imagine what that's like.",
        "Bill: Yeah. Um, look, I'm sorry I haven't had time to go to the Spaulding's' to get more evidence from the car yet.",
        "Harley: No, it's okay. It's okay. My mission actually involves the hit and run. I think I know a way to prove that Phillip was driving the car.",
        "Bill: How?",
        "Harley: Not how, who. Lizzie. I saw her. I think she knows what Phillip did that night. All I have to do is get her to 'fess up.",
        "Bill: You're going to get her to rat out her father? Good luck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Sandy. How are you feeling?",
        "Sandy: Better.",
        "Buzz: Any word on that gentleman that hit you and ran away?",
        "Sandy: Not yet. They're looking into it, I guess.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, they are. My son is the police chief and he doesn't take things like that lightly.",
        "Sandy: Yeah. Frank is a good guy. How's the book?",
        "Buzz: Oh, it's good enough so that I don't mind having an empty restaurant. You can borrow it after I'm finished with it.",
        "Sandy: Oh, thanks, but I don't think I'll be around long enough to read it and return it.",
        "Buzz: You're leaving town.",
        "Sandy: That seems like the smart thing to do at this point.",
        "Buzz: Why? Why in the world would you lie to Reva about being her son.",
        "Sandy: That wasn't the plan when I came to Springfield, but...",
        "Buzz: But the opportunity presented itself and you couldn't resist. Was it for money?",
        "Sandy: No, money was the last thing on my mind. I just wanted a family like the Lewis's.",
        "Buzz: Well, they're a good bunch. I could have done worse.",
        "Sandy: And I blew it.",
        "Buzz: You could straighten it out, you know.",
        "Sandy: Doubtful.",
        "Buzz: A long time ago, I ran out on my kids and I came back, and they wanted nothing to do with me, but I toughed it out, and you know, here I am.",
        "Sandy: Yeah. But the Lewis's aren't my real family.",
        "Buzz: The Lewis's cared for you. You still care for them. You want them back in your life? You're going to have to tough it out. You have to fight for them.",
        "Sandy: I... no, no.",
        "Buzz: Hey, you made a mistake. So you fix it. What have you got to lose? I'm going to take a walk. Help yourself if you want something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: How are the newlyweds? Oh, you're not in a talkative mood? That's okay. Then just listen. Should you feel a sudden inclination to purge your guilty conscience and tell your son that it was you who tried to have Olivia deported, don't. Because your son will not be happy with the kind of trouble that you've gotten him into.",
        "Billy: Unlike you, I think my son can handle Olivia.",
        "Phillip: I'm not talking about the marriage, Billy. I'm talking about the investigation.",
        "Billy: Investigation?",
        "Phillip: Yeah. You see, as a responsible citizen, I just felt that it was my duty to inform the INS that their union might not be on the up-and-up. And, you know, interestingly enough, they already had their doubts. (Laughs) see what you started?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Yes. Agent Lafferty, yes. With the INS. We met at towers. How can I... how can I forget? What can I do for you? Well, of course Olivia and I are living as man and wife. Yeah, you want to stop by? Sure, sure. No problem. When? Um, well, now is not the best time, because I have to... yeah, but I... but if you just get... I understand. All right. Well, I'll see you soon. Great.",
        "Harley: The guy is coming here tonight? You'll never get away with this. Olivia's stuff isn't even here.",
        "Bill: Sure it is. You don't mind if I borrow this, do you?",
        "Harley: Well, it's not really Olivia's style. Or size, I might add.",
        "Bill: Harley, he is a guy. He's not going to notice these things.",
        "Harley: He's an INS agent. He is trained to notice everything.",
        "Bill: Oh, this is great. You have makeup here, so what I'm going to do is, I'll stick this in the bathroom, lay out an extra toothbrush and we are all set. (Laughs)",
        "Harley: You hope so. All right, I would stay and help you, but I've got to go.",
        "Bill: No, no, no. You go and do what you've got to do, Ruthie baby. Okay? (Cell phone rings)",
        "Coop: Hello.",
        "Harley: Hello. It's your favorite sister. What are you up to?",
        "Coop: Right now? Pain and torment.",
        "Harley: Are you with Lizzie?",
        "Coop: Uh-huh. At Farley's. And guess what? Harley, she has me dog-sitting.",
        "Harley: Okay, well trust me when I say, \"this too shall pass.\" Just hang in there. Hang tough, okay? I'll be in touch. Listen to me.",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Harley: Lizzie is at Farley's bar right now. I am going over there and I am going to put the screws to her and I am going to make her tell me what she knows about the hit and run that night if it kills her.",
        "Bill: Good luck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: Wow. Look at that.",
        "Ross: Yes. Dinah didn't tell me that O'Neill was going to be here.",
        "Blake: You knew Dinah was going to be here? You set me up?",
        "Ross: Blake, Dinah said...",
        "Blake: Ross, do you know how furious I was with you when you stopped me from going on that trip with Sebastian and my mother? It was everything I could do to just come out to dinner with you, and now you pull this?",
        "Ross: Look, Dinah said that she had some good news. I thought it would be nice for a change for us to share something...",
        "Blake: I'm not sharing anything with her. I am not going to that table. I'm not sitting at that table with her.",
        "Ross: Blake, she's my daughter. You are her stepmother. She's in town; we're in town. You can't keep from dealing with her forever.",
        "Blake: You want to bet? I have to hit the powder room. I need a deep breath. Yes, this is the mayor's wife. That favor I had in the works? I need it now.",
        "Dinah: Looks like Blakey just had another tantrum and hurt my father's feelings again.",
        "Jeffrey: Wait. Where are you going?",
        "Dinah: I am going to ask him to still join us for dinner.",
        "Jeffrey: Just let it be.",
        "Dinah: No. I'm not. I am going to show my father and everybody else in this town that I am moving on and making a wonderful life for myself, and that I am beyond such childishness, even if Blake isn't. Excuse me.",
        "Jeffrey: Dinah.",
        "Dinah: Excuse me. Did Blake leave?",
        "Ross: Um, she just went to get a breath of fresh air. What is going on, Dinah? What is O'Neill doing here?",
        "Dinah: He is having dinner with his girlfriend. I'm not only working for Jeffrey but I am dating him, as well.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: This thing with Bill and the INS, I don't want you to take this personally.",
        "Billy: Oh, gee. I feel a lot better now.",
        "Phillip: It's business, Billy, pure and simple. See, I have to have Lewis Oil and Lewis Construction and you and your family are standing in my way.",
        "Billy: At least you finally admit that.",
        "Phillip: Of course. Why not? Look, I've got this dirt on you and that's golden, but if you come clean to bill, I lose all that leverage, so I had to figure out a way that I could keep you from being tempted to do that. Because I do think that he would probably forgive you for putting him in a position where he had to marry Olivia. But forgive you for sending him to jail? I don't think so.",
        "Billy: You made a mistake when you went after my family. Now, you've got yourself trouble.",
        "Phillip: So do something about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: I had to run some errands before the store closed. You don't mind, do you? I didn't want to leave it in the car. Hey. What's...",
        "Bill: Give me this. Give me this. Give me this. We can't go on like this, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: What?",
        "Bill: Living apart, all right? You've got to move in with me. Now, look, I already put some stuff in the closet for you. See?",
        "Olivia: (Gasps) gosh, they're... nice. They're not my style and they're kind of large. We don't have to move in right away. It's not a big deal.",
        "Bill: Yes, we do.",
        "Olivia: Why?",
        "Bill: The INS is snooping around towers. They want to interview the both of us. I thought I put them off for a while but they just called. He wants to come by tonight.",
        "Olivia: Tonight?",
        "Bill: Yes, tonight. And I already put some makeup and stuff in the bathroom, but if you can do, you know, your womanly ways here, please feel free.",
        "Olivia: I should go to the beacon and get my stuff. I should get some stuff.",
        "Bill: No, no, listen to me. We don't have time for that, okay? Now, just let's take a deep breath, relax, get comfortable, settle down, okay?",
        "Olivia: All right.",
        "Bill: All right.",
        "Olivia: So, if he's coming, then we should talk. What kind of questions do you think he's going to ask us?",
        "Bill: Probably the usual, like, family routine, who gets up first in the morning, who makes the coffee, stuff like that.",
        "Olivia: Well, who does get up first? Who makes the coffee? I don't know.",
        "Bill: That would be... (knock on door)",
        "Olivia: (Screams)",
        "Bill: Relax. Take a deep breath with me. Let me handle this, I'm the smooth talker.",
        "Olivia: Huh?",
        "Bill: No, you've got a bigger mouth for BS. Okay? You do it.",
        "Olivia: You're so sweet.",
        "Bill: All right, we can do this.",
        "Olivia: We can?",
        "Bill: We can. Come on.",
        "Jonathan: Hi, Aunt Olivia. Did you miss me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Girl: So cute.",
        "Coop: You have two cats? I love cats. See, most guys don't like them, but me, I'm just...",
        "Lizzie: Um, excuse me? Can I borrow my driver for a minute? Aren't you supposed to be filling tires with air, something like that? He's not supposed to be socializing, Miss. Thank you.",
        "Coop: No, Ashley, wait. Uh... Lizzie, do you realize what you just did? I was about to get her number.",
        "Lizzie: Do you realize you were just using my dog as chick bait?",
        "Coop: Jealous?",
        "Lizzie: Please. Come on.",
        "Coop: Oh, that's a good comeback.",
        "Lizzie: Don't talk to me like that.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, I'm going to talk to you the way I feel like talking to you. First off, the only reason why I'm doing this job is because I have to, not because I want to. Secondly, unlike the Spaulding's, when the Cooper's cause damage, we actually step up to the plate and we take the hit. We certainly do not run away.",
        "Lizzie: Well, maybe people just get scared sometimes. Not everybody can be as brave as you.",
        "Buzz: Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. I know you. You're Phillip Spaulding's new flunky, aren't you? The one that's helping him torture my son. You here to do more damage?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: Dinah, I can't believe that you're dating the district attorney. Sweetheart, you don't know O'Neill the way that I do. He's a womanizer, without scruples. I mean, the man is rude and...",
        "Blake: Well, it's a match made in heaven. We'll leave you lovebirds alone, all right?",
        "Dinah: No. Stay, please. Join us for dinner. I'm doing everything I can to straighten out my life.",
        "Ross: Sweetheart, we'll stay for one drink.",
        "Blake: No, we will not.",
        "Ross: One drink, Blake. Honey, lead the way. Jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: Mr. Mayor. Mrs. Mayor.",
        "Blake: One drink.",
        "Dinah: Well, you're really biting the bullet for your husband there, aren't you, Blake?",
        "Blake: Oh, a bullet. There's an interesting metaphor for the woman who killed my brother.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, I think I'll get a waitress.",
        "Blake: Don't bother.",
        "Ross: Blake, why don't you sit down and I will ask them for a couple more...",
        "Delivery man: Mrs. Marler.",
        "Blake: Thank you. That was fast. Thank you.",
        "Ross: What is that?",
        "Blake: It's for you, Dinah. Apparently I won't be the one leaving, after all. You will.",
        "Ross: What do you mean?",
        "Dinah: It's a restraining order. Against me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Oh, great. You know, I've had it up to here with people that are trying to hurt my family. Is that okay with you?",
        "Sandy: Fine with me. I'm out of here.",
        "Billy: Good. Hey, and when you hit the door, you should just keep on going until you get to another state. Before you go, where's Buzz?",
        "Sandy: He went for a walk. See you, Billy.",
        "Billy: Hey, you know, you really are one lucky boy, Sandy.",
        "Sandy: Oh, really? How do you figure that one?",
        "Billy: Well, you just waltz into town, you lie to everybody and then you just settle down in the middle of my family and have yourself a good old time. As a matter of fact, you even got Reva to give you one of her organs when you got hit in that car accident.",
        "Sandy: I got hit in that car accident because I was saving Tammy's life.",
        "Billy: Yeah, well you owed us that. As a matter of fact, you owe us a lot more, but you know, it's too bad you won't be around to pay it.",
        "Sandy: You really are going to ride me out of town on the rails, huh?",
        "Billy: No. I think you're smart enough. I think you'll just leave on your own. I mean, Josh and Reva have enough trouble now with the real Jonathan. They don't need any more from you.",
        "Sandy: I've been beating myself up about what's been going on, but I tell you what, I loved your family. I still do. I tried to be the best cousin, the best brother, the best son I could. I admit, yeah, I made a mistake, a huge mistake. You ever make a mistake?",
        "Billy: Yeah. But I didn't pretend I was somebody else.",
        "Sandy: You never had to. And I made my mistake and I'm owning up to it. I'm no hit and run driver. I'm going to stay in town and I'm going to do what I can to fix it. And then I'll decide where I'm going. If I go. Maybe I can prove that, you know, maybe I do belong here, with your family. Maybe I'm not going to give up on the Lewis's. Maybe I'm not going to let them give up on me.",
        "Billy: Well, it's a free country. You can take your best shot.",
        "Sandy: Yes, it is. I will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Nice place. What's the matter, Aunt Olivia? You don't recognize your own nephew?",
        "Olivia: Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Are you sure? You weren't when Sandy Foster waltzed into town.",
        "Olivia: (Sighs) I'm glad to see you. Why don't you come in? Come in.",
        "Bill: No, yeah, come in.",
        "Jonathan: Cousin Bill! Or is it Uncle Bill? I hear congratulations are in order.",
        "Bill: Really? Well, I've heard some things about you from my Uncle Josh.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, yeah?",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Jonathan: What did you hear? Giving Reva a hard time. Just chalk it up to my tough upbringing. But, you know, you'd know about that, right?",
        "Olivia: No, I didn't. And if I did, I would have done something about it.",
        "Bill: Olivia, please. Please.",
        "Olivia: What?",
        "Bill: You don't owe him any apologies. Now, you've got to go.",
        "Olivia: No, he doesn't. Excuse me. Come here.",
        "Bill: Oh, Olivia...",
        "Olivia: Look, I just... I can't talk right now but I want to sit down, I want to hear your side of the story and I want you to hear mine, all right? Okay? What?",
        "Bill: No, it's not all right. I do not want him here.",
        "Olivia: He's my family.",
        "Bill: Well, you know what? I'm your family now--at least that's what it says on the marriage license. And this is my place.",
        "Olivia: I thought it was our place, Bill.",
        "Bill: Please, I'm not going to get into this with you now.",
        "Olivia: Why?",
        "Jonathan: Hey, you guys don't need to whisper on my account. I know that you only married him because you want to stay in the country. I heard the rumor.",
        "Bill: I don't want him here, Olivia. That's it.",
        "Olivia: What about what I want?",
        "Bill: Do I get to tell you what he's done to my Aunt Reva? Do you want me to get into that?",
        "Olivia: You're not listening to my side of the story.",
        "Bill: Are you listening... right now, your side of the story is not the most important thing.",
        "Olivia: Are you telling me my feelings don't matter? Are you kidding me? (Knock on door)",
        "Bill: I am not saying that. I'm saying I do not want him here.",
        "Olivia: You don't even know him. You're listening to Josh and Reva. They don't know anything about him, either. (Bill and Olivia arguing)",
        "INS Agent: Agent Lafferty, INS. You are?",
        "Jonathan: I'm the nephew. Hey, come on in. I want to introduce you to the happy couple.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Ruth, isn't it? Isn't it Ruth?",
        "Ruth: Yes, yes, that's right.",
        "Buzz: You here to harass my kid, courtesy of Phillip Spaulding? You going to humiliate him a little bit more. Do you have any idea what that family has done to me and my kids, my kids who I'm grateful and proud every day to know? Do you people have a heart? Look at me. Look me in the eye when I talk to you. Fine. To hell with you.",
        "Harley: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: You don't know the first thing that's happened about me and my life.",
        "Coop: I could take a pretty good guess at it.",
        "Lizzie: Do you know my parents have been married so many times? I don't even know the count. Have you ever had your father get married to your grandfather's witch of an ex-wife and get her pregnant, on top of it? You just sit there and watch your father make one of the biggest mistakes in his life and you can't do a thing about it? And then he gets thrown in the looney bin on top of it and you have to go visit him there, and he talks to you and he doesn't remember anything. He looks at you and he doesn't even know who you are.",
        "Coop: I didn't know this stuff, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, well, did you know my mom got locked away, too? Split personality. She lost her mind. She was acting like the town slut. Yeah, that was a real riot, Coop. Believe me, and I thought it was bad when I had leukemia when I was little.",
        "Coop: I knew that. I had just forgotten it.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. Did you know I almost died? You know, sometimes I wish I had. Because all my life has been up until now is having jerks like you tell me how my life is so messed up, but yet I always get what I want! Now, you know what? I don't get what I want. You're completely wrong. Just shut up and leave me alone, please.",
        "Coop: What was that, Roxie?",
        "Buzz: That, my son, would be a Spaulding woman in top form.",
        "Lizzie: Hi, Ruth. What are you doing here?",
        "Ruth: Well, dear, your father wanted me to check on you, make sure you are all right.",
        "Lizzie: Fine.",
        "Ruth: Well, it's just that he's afraid you'll say something, dear. You know, spill the beans. Because you're here in this place. Lizzie, dear, your father told me what happened.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "INS agent: No wedding photos. I guess they don't allow cameras in a jail cell.",
        "Bill: Well, we keep the memories right here. Right here. (Both laugh slightly)",
        "INS agent: These your clothes, ma'am?",
        "Olivia: Well, there certainly not my husband's.",
        "INS agent: They don't look like they're your style, Miss Spencer.",
        "Olivia: Actually I prefer Mrs. Lewis. And those are my business clothes.",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Olivia: The ones that I wear when I need, you know, investors and so forth and so on.",
        "INS agent: Where are the rest of your things?",
        "Bill: We are with... well, we haven't had time to bring everything over just yet. It was quick.",
        "Olivia: No it happened so fast and it's been very stressful. It's just a lot to adjust to.",
        "INS agent: Oh. Is that what you two were arguing about when I came in?",
        "Olivia: No. That?",
        "Bill: No. That's just like newlywed stuff.",

        "Jonathon: Uncle bill, Aunt Olivia. Hey, guys, come on. Don't lie to Agent Lafferty. Among other things that's a federal offense.",
        "Bill: Didn't you say you have dinner plans? Because we don't want to keep you?",
        "Jonathon: No. They were arguing about me. Well, it was less of an argument more of a spat really. I came over spur of the moment and said, \"let's have dinner together tonight.\" And Aunt Liv was up for it, but Uncle Bill said, you know, it's still officially their honeymoon and well, you know, he wants her to himself tonight. And I know that Aunt Liv wants to be alone with him, too, but she could tell that I was at loose ends and she took pity on me. She is such a sweetheart. The best. You know, I'm a little disappointed that they had to rush the wedding because of the whole deportation thing. You know, I was really looking forward to walking you down the aisle with Sam. Sam's her brother, my Uncle. She was going to walk down the aisle between us, one on each arm.",
        "INS agent: You were planning a wedding before this?",
        "Bill: Yes.",
        "Jonathon: Oh, yeah, the church, reception at the Beacon. Hey, you should come. You guys are still going to do the reception, right?",
        "Olivia: That's the plan.",
        "Bill: Mm-hmm.",
        "INS agent: Okay, folks. Thanks for your time. I'll be in touch.",
        "Olivia: Okay.",
        "Bill: So that's it? That's all?",
        "INS agent: For tonight. There'll be more questions, formal interviews. For now, I think I got everything I need. Good night.",
        "Olivia: Good night.",
        "Jonathon: Good night. (Laughs) well, he bought it. And I just did you guys a huge favor. So, now it's payback time.",

        "Blake: Well, I guess it pays to be the mayor's wife.",
        "Ross: Do you think this is funny?",
        "Blake: Oh, no. Ross, this is tragic. It's tragic that you don't see how dangerous Dinah is. But you know what? I do. And a judge agrees with me. So as long as I stay close to you, Dinah can't.",
        "Ross: Well, sweetheart, it works the other way around, too.",
        "Jeffrey: You just love watching them fight over you, don't you?",

        "Buzz: Never crossed my mind. Just in the neighborhood. But I found something.",
        "Coop: You went in my room?",
        "Buzz: Well, I was curious. You know, you're always keeping away something.",
        "Coop: Dad, it's nothing.",
        "Buzz: No, it's not nothing. That is amazing. The places you've been all around the world.",
        "Coop: Not all over the world.",
        "Buzz: And you could write. I mean who knew you were such a great writer.",
        "Coop: Dad, it's just words on paper, mostly experiences.",
        "Buzz: The first few pages...",
        "Coop: Now, Dad, please. Don't..",

        "Lizzie: Help me how?",
        "Ruth: Do you want to talk? I'm a very good listener. And I'm very discreet. That's why your father hired me. I must admit I am surprised that you came back here after everything that's happened here, knowing what you know. You're a very brave young girl.",

        "Dinah: Everything we've been to one another has been based on Cassie since day one. And I'm fine with that. I will take the downside, because the upside feels so incredibly good. But even I have my limits.",
        "Jeffrey: What is that suppose to mean?",
        "Dinah: When you're with me be with me. Don't phone it in. Act like you care even if you don't. Especially in front of my father.",
        "Jeffrey: Why? So you'll get people to believe that you're on the straight and narrow now?",
        "Dinah: Exactly. And I can move on with my life and you can stop worrying what I might do to Cassie. That's the deal. Take or leave it.",

        "Blake: Well, I thought about telling my husband, the man who is suppose to protect me, but I'm realizing unfortunately that he doesn't care about my feelings.",
        "Ross: Maybe that's because you keep doing one foolish and impulsive thing after another.",
        "Blake: Foolish. My restraining Dinah is impulsive, but you're methodically locking me up in a jail cell now. That's perfectly accepted.",
        "Ross: Oh, yeah. I see. That's what this is all about.",
        "Blake: No, it's not. I'm just trying to make a point, Ross.",
        "Ross: No, what you're doing is undermining my relationship with my daughter. Now why don't you just come up and admit it. You want me to choose between you and Dinah.",

        "Olivia: It's fine. I'll do it, okay. I'll call Cameron at the front desk and tell him to expect you.",

        "Bill: Open up? What? So he could take advantage of you some more?",
        "Olivia: He could have wrecked everything, but he didn't.",
        "Bill: Because he wanted something. That's what... he's a punk. Reva and Josh should be a great place in their life and then this kid comes out of nowhere and now everything is just haywire.",
        "Olivia: Wait a minute. No. I can't believe you're saying this.",
        "Bill: Are you...",

        "Billy: Yeah, I'm sure. I never go in and drink. I just sometimes when I'm tense I think about drinking.",

        "Bill: No. Not at... not at all. I'm crazy about her. But I mean, look, I know we haven't talked about this. You know maybe she shouldn't get so attached to me because you know, it could confuse her. And I wouldn't want that.",
        "Olivia: No.",
        "Bill: No.",
        "Olivia: Of course not.",
        "Olivia: And I wouldn't want that either. So... we were going to do some work today, but I'm so tired after all of this. Can we do it some other time?",

        "Billy: And Phillip.... Phillip found out about it and he's holding it over my head. As matter of fact, he's threatening me and he's threatening Bill.",

        "Coop: Perfect. You're here. Now you can take her home.",

        "Harley/Ruth: I had Lizzie in the palm of my hand. And then Coop showed up.",
        "Bill: Wait a minute. Back up. Are you telling me your hunch was right? That Lizzie knows that Phillip was involved the hit and run?",
        "Harley: Yes. And it is killing her to keep quiet. I'm not kidding. I'm not kidding. I was this close to getting her to crack. Now I've got to finagle a way to cross paths with her again. Hopefully tomorrow.",
        "Bill: All right. Well, can I ask you a dumb question? What if Lizzie tells Phillip that you were asking questions about the accident?",
        "Harley/Ruth: Exactly. That could be a problem. That's why I have to see her tomorrow before she compares notes with Phillip. (Phone rings) that's Ruth. It's Phillip.",
        "Bill: All right. All right.",
        "Harley/Ruth: Ruth Karloff.",
        "Phillip: Yeah, Ruth, it's Phillip Spaulding. Listen, I'm sorry to call you so late, but something's come up and I need you to take care of it right away.",
