        "Harley: You and I have some unfinished business, Beth.",

        "Harley: Well neither am I.",
        "Gus: Honey. Liz? Hi.",
        "Beth: Here is a little unfinished business for you, Harley.",
        "Gus: No.",
        "Harley: I've got to tell you, I am nervous.",
        "Gus: Listen to me, you're perfect for this job, you're perfect for Spaulding. Whatever way that comes out of your mouth, it is going to come across. Just breathe and be yourself, be yourself. ( Laughing )",
        "Zack: Mommy, mommy. I'm a cop.",
        "Gus: You're a cop, what are you? A gambler.",
        "Buzz: They can't wait to see Mommy give her presentation. She is going to be great, isn't she? She is going to be great!! She is going to be great!!",
        "Beth: Oh, yeah, go get 'em, Harley.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Bill Lewis. Lewis! Do you know where he went? I'm his wife. Esposa, wife. Hello.",
        "Alexandra: Bad connection?",
        "Olivia: No, the job site is very remote, and incredibly loud.",
        "Alexandra: Maybe I was talking about your love connection.",
        "Olivia: Bill and I are fine. He is finishing up a huge job in Venezuela, and he'll be back.",
        "Alexandra: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Hey, boss.",
        "Mallet: Hey, rook.",
        "Marina: Aren't you working?",
        "Mallet: Sort of. I got myself involved in this whole thing, but someone else will be watching tonight.",
        "Marina: Me, too, I thought Danny and Michelle could use a little time alone together to work through things.",
        "Mallet: Uh-huh. Time alone, huh? Are you okay with that?",
        "Marina: Sure.",
        "Mallet: Sure.",
        "Marina: Okay, the truth is sometimes doing the right thing sucks. Okay, hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Remember, I got them when we were picking out all of those little pink dresses.",
        "Michelle: I always wanted to have someone to buy little pink dresses for. Do you believe this?",
        "Danny: No. Yes -- no.",
        "Michelle: I've been sitting in the cabin trying to figure out how to say good- bye, to try to figure out how to say hello, and how we're going to do this.",
        "Danny: Cassie knows the baby is ours, and she has had some time to prepare for this.",
        "Michelle: If time is not going to help, nothing will. She loves that little baby. How am I going to do this? How am I going to take our baby, any baby, from the only mother she has ever known?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You have to be the hugest pumpkin in the patch. Look how amazing you are. She is pumpkin.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. Cassie, are you,,",
        "Cassie: Halloween is my favorite, and it begins tonight while the kids go trick-or- treating door-to-door. RJ is getting his costume out.",
        "Jeffrey: I think you need to be prepared, Danny went to tell Michelle, and they could be here any minute.",
        "Cassie: We don't know how long it is going to take Danny to find Michelle, and it could be days, days.",
        "Jeffrey: You want it to be days.",
        "Cassie: I want it to be years. But we don't know what is going to happen, so I am just going to pretend like everything is normal, and I'm going to take my little girl to a Halloween party. What could be more normal than that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: How we going to do it, Danny. We going to show up at Cassie's door and say we're here for our daughter.",
        "Danny: Of course not, we need to call her and set up a day and a time.",
        "Michelle: It just sounds so cold. She is going to be sitting and counting the hours, and then she is going to be counting the minutes, and we're going to show up there. What if she says no? What if she refuses to give Hope up? I would if I were Cassie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You're Mommy's little pumpkin, aren't you? You are. You know that, you're all mine-- all mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: All right, you can't keep avoiding me forever, Bill, you can't. Can you? Oh, no, no, no. Oh, great. ( Sobbing ) Where is my husband? Why not, why the hell not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: I'm so glad you guys could come with me today so you can see what Mommy does when she's at work?",
        "Beth: Great Halloween costumes, James is going as a scarecrow this year. Eileen didn't tell me you were going to bring the boys.",
        "Harley: I thought it would be great. Spaulding is a family-friendly company. Great for everybody.",
        "Zach: Mommy can I look at that?",
        "Beth: That is boring grownup stuff, you don't want to look at that.",
        "Harley: You better grab some stuff and I'll be out in just a minute. Watch him, please, Zach. What is going on, Beth?",
        "Beth: What is going on is I was trying to protect your son.",
        "Harley: From what?",
        "Beth: They were just Halloween outfits.",
        "Harley: It is a little late for that. The point is, that wasn't your call to make. You have to accept that I'm the one in charge, Beth, not you, and not that shrink who is pulling your strings.",
        "Beth: No one is pulling my strings. I make my own decisions.",
        "Harley: You want to look me in the eyes and say that.",
        "Beth: I know who I am.",
        "Harley: So does Alan, and he will use it.",
        "Beth: Alan isn't using me.",
        "Harley: So you love Alan as much as you love Phillip.",
        "Beth: People have different reasons for marrying.",
        "Harley: Yeah, yours would be power. You know, Beth, you have a lot more to lose here than just love.",
        "Beth: Oh, yeah, and you know so much about love, don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: You know, if it wasn't for you, Danny and Michelle would never know they have a daughter. I guess they must be pretty excited.",
        "Marina: Yeah, they are. All three of us are getting ready for it.",
        "Mallet: The three of you?",
        "Marina: Yeah, Danny and me and Michelle. It is not going to be easy deciding where Hope is going to stay and when, but we'll work through it. It is just a matter of ironing out the details.",
        "Mallet: Well, details can sometimes be the tricky part.",
        "Marina: But the more she is with them--",
        "Mallet: No, that is just life is strange.",
        "Marina: I don't understand that, I'm old.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Cassie was so kind and so generous when she thought I had lost my baby. What are we going to do, go over to her house now and trick-or- treat?",
        "Danny: There is no neat and tidy way to do this, but we have a little girl who needs to be with her mother and father at home.",
        "Michelle: Well, is it your place or --",
        "Danny: I was thinking that you and she would go to your family's house so that she can be with Mel and Rick and there is more room and she can see Robbie, her big brother.",
        "Michelle: You know, it is a big house. I mean we could all be there together. And you could be there, and we could use this place for extra storage, for baby stuff. There is plenty of storage.",
        "Marina: That's Marina's stuff.",
        "Michelle: Oh, God, I'm so sorry. You live with Marina, of course you live with Marina. I'm losing my mind.",
        "Danny: Michelle, there is a lot going on.",
        "Michelle: I was just thinking about the baby and where the baby is going to live.",
        "Danny: Michelle, we'll figure it out, okay? We can't figure it all out right now. We'll just deal with things one step at a time.",
        "Michelle: Sure, yeah. Well, we'll work it out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: That really is quite a costume. Of course I always figured Hope for the superhero type, like her mother.",
        "Cassie: Thank you, for playing along. I know that I have to give her up. And I know that my days as Hope's mother are numbered. I just don't know how I'm going to do it, so it just seems like it is easier to pretend like it is a normal day, and you know, kind of like if you don't talk about it, then maybe --",
        "Jeffrey: Then Danny and Michelle will disappear?",
        "Cassie: Kind of sad, huh?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, but you know what, you are amazing.",
        "Cassie: I don't feel amazing. I want to scream and I want to cry. And I want to take Hope and I want to run away with her. That's how amazing I am. Every time I look at her, I find myself memorizing everything about her, you know. The tiny little nose, and perfect little lips and her beautiful eyes.",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie, come on. This isn't good-bye, you're going to see her again.",
        "Cassie: I think the hardest part is not knowing where or how it is going to happen.",
        "Jeffrey: Don't do that. Don't focus on that. Hey, let's think about how blessed we are and were to have Hope in our lives for the time we did. We are still going to have her in our hearts, even when, you know--when she is gone.",
        "Jeffrey: Danny and Michelle are friends, Danny and Michelle are going to let you watch her take her first steps, and ride her first bike--",
        "Cassie: Okay. I don't know. I want to be stronger than this. I want to be stronger than this.",
        "Jeffrey: Well you know what? You don't have to stay here missing her, either. I've got a great idea. Why don't we... why don't we take Tammy and R.J. And Sandy and we can even go down to San Cristobel and get Will. We'll take a trip somewhere, we'll have a blast. We'll just get some time and get some space.",
        "Cassie: It hurts.",
        "Jeffrey: I know.",
        "Cassie: There's one good thing, you know? There is one good thing.",
        "Jeffrey: What's that?",
        "Cassie: I know that I am giving Hope to parents who love her as much as I do. Just not tonight. It just can't be tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Whoever that was, could you hand me a yefrj?",
        "Olivia: Which one?",
        "Buzz: Wait a second. I know those guams. You know, today has been my kind of day. First the oven goes on the fritz now there's something clogging the drain. Harley hasn't started her presentation, has she?",
        "Olivia: No, no, you still have time.",
        "Buzz: What?",
        "Olivia: Earlier I...",
        "Buzz: Earlier what?",
        "Olivia: Nothing. Good luck.",
        "Buzz: No, stay. Stay, I need some help. I need somebody to hand me tools.",
        "Olivia: Did you ever think about just hiring a plumber?",
        "Buzz: You know, I thought of that but then I thought maybe I should put my kids through college instead. Oh, hammer.",
        "Olivia: Hammer. Here you go.",
        "Buzz: Why? Why with all the V.I.P.'s showing up why does this have to happen? Wait a second. A wedding ring?",
        "Buzz: I found the culprit.",
        "Olivia: You did? What'd you get?",
        "Buzz: It's a wedding ring.",
        "Olivia: A wedding ring? You're kidding.",
        "Buzz: Right here.",
        "Olivia: Uh-huh. Ooh. Well I guess one of your waitresses must have lost it.",
        "Buzz: I don't think. So it has an \"o\" and an \"l\" engraved in it. That together with your bare finger tells me the case is solved.",
        "Olivia: That's good detective work. I was washing out a glass and it slipped off my finger and it fell down the drain.",
        "Buzz: Your wedding ring? You didn't panic? Didn't tell me it was lost? I guess I'll mind my own business. I've got to get cleaned up to see Harley anyway.",
        "Olivia: I took it as a sign.",
        "Buzz: A sign?",
        "Olivia: A sign. An omen. You know, my ring rent down the drain and so is my marriage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Hi, hello there. I didn't realize Hammer made public appearances as Marley's event.",
        "Mallet: You like prison literature? Don't surprise me. Remind you of the good old days? I'm just here to support an old friend.",
        "Alexandra: You keep telling yourself that, okay?",
        "Marina: Aren't you going to go say hello to Harley?",
        "Mallet: Uh... yeah, I'm going to talk to her later. She's probably got a lot on her mind right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Well, my goal is to double the dividend of all the shareholders within three years.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, an admirable goal.",
        "Harley: Would you excuse me, please? Alex, don't start with me.",
        "Alexandra: I just came by to wish you good luck.",
        "Harley: I don't need luck. I've got the entire event planned from beginning to end and neither you nor Beth nor Alan is going to ruin this for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Remember the good old days, Beth? Hmm? When you were Beth, before you turned into this Stepford wife.",
        "Beth: We're not going to go through this again, are we?",
        "Gus: I'm trying to understand. Was it is kisses he stole before he drank his smashed banana milk shake or him feeling you up between the bars before his nap time.",
        "Beth: Not all marriages are built on romantic love.",
        "Gus: If Phillip could see you now.",
        "Beth: I don't regret my marriage. I know what I'm dealing with him.",
        "Gus: Alan twists things. He'll destroy somebody's house and make it seem like its Habitat for Humanity, he'll destroy somebody's life-- like Harley-- and make it seem like a rapeous deed.",
        "Beth: I don't want to hurt her.",
        "Gus: Then you won't mind if I keep this, will you? Is it that good?",
        "Beth: It's Harley's, she needs it for her presentation.",
        "Gus: She needs like this like she needs a lobotomy.",
        "Beth: Trust me, Gus, you don't want to see what's on that D.V.D.",
        "Gus: Beth, there was actually a time... oh, forget it.",
        "Beth: Don't press \"play\" Gus. Don't do it. You'll be sorry.",
        "Gus: We'll see about that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: You know what, Danny? This isn't going to fit her, it's too big. I don't know what size she wears. I... I don't know how much she weighs. I don't know... I don't know what kind of formula she eats. I don't know when she naps.",
        "Danny: Michelle, we'll figure it out. We have time.",
        "Michelle: Yes. Yes, we do. We have her whole life, right? And pretty soon it's going to be Mary Janes and dance recitals, slumber parties, sweet 16, college.",
        "Danny: Let's not marry her off yet, okay?",
        "Michelle: Well, after everything that's happened, did you ever think we'd be here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: No,. Are R.J., Don't knock on that door!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Uh-oh, we're out of candy.",
        "Cassie: I guess no-no one's there. Come on, we should go.",
        "Danny: Hi.",
        "Cassie: You're back.",
        "Danny: We're back.",
        "Cassie: When did you guys get back?",
        "Danny: Just a little whiling ago.",
        "Jeffrey: Let's go down and get more candy by the other I doors. That a boy.",
        "Cassie: It's the beacon's annual Halloween...",
        "Michelle: I know. Nice costumes and. Pirate and...",
        "Cassie: She's a pumpkin.",
        "Michelle: Cute.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. We thought you were out of town.",
        "Danny: Well, we were. I found Michelle at the Bauer cabin and when I told her, we... you know, we had to come back.",
        "Michelle: I don't want to hurt you, Cassie, I really don't. But can I hold her?",
        "Cassie: No.",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie.",
        "Cassie: I can't do this. Not now. I'm not ready for this and we don't have her things with us right now.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, we can... we can go back, you know, and get them.",
        "Cassie: No. Okay? I wasn't ready for this now, Jeffrey.",
        "Michelle: Cassie, I don't know how to handle this, either. But I know that you understand how lost you can feel when your baby gets taken from you. You know, it's kind of like you can't... you can't breathe. Like a part of you has been cut off.",
        "Cassie: She needs to be changed and I haven't fed her yet.",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie, I... the.",
        "Cassie: And she's really been having a hard time sleeping lately.",
        "Michelle: I don't want to hurt you, Cassie. I really don't.",
        "Cassie: And, um, she really likes it when I sing her this song when she's going to sleep that, um, Jeffrey taught to me and when she's really upset she likes the sound of wind chimes and if you hold her, that makes her feel better.",
        "Michelle: Cassie, Cassie, don't worry. I'm not going to push you, okay? You have been a wonderful mother to Hope and I hope you know how hard I'm going to work to make this as easy as possible for you and for her.",
        "Danny: We don't have to do this right now. That's not what we... we couldn't ask for a better home for Hope to be in until she's returned to us. Okay?",
        "Michelle: Can I hold her?",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie...",
        "Cassie: Yeah, of course you can. She's... um... she's your baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: So, see, I'm a free woman. Or at least I'm about to be.",
        "Buzz: Have you told Bill?",
        "Olivia: Oh, no, this was his idea, you know? I don't cut hit in the wife department. Much more comfortable ironing out a deal with a shirt so he went down to Venezuela to find my replacement.",
        "Buzz: I heard he was away on business.",
        "Olivia: That's his replacement. He chose his company over mine.",
        "Buzz: I never saw him as a Stormtrak 5 live Doppler network-a-holic.",
        "Olivia: I have a whole file full of divorce papers to prove that the easiest way to get a divorce is to parry me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: You didn't know that this happened, did you? I'm sure Harley swore that nothing in Blake's book was true but she lied. Doesn't one good betrayal deserve another?",
        "Harley: It's time. (Laughs) hurry up! Give me my good luck kiss !",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: You should go inside. I'm sure you have some work to do.",
        "Buzz: I always have work to do. Just sometimes, things are more important.",
        "Olivia: Not for me. No. No, no. If I have a job to do, I just do it, nothing gets in my way. I've been like that since I was a kid. If I had a paper due, I turned it in early.",
        "Buzz: You never played hooky?",
        "Olivia: No!",
        "Buzz: Never took a job when your family or friends needed you?",
        "Olivia: No, I haven't. I haven't. Oh, my gosh. What am I doing? What am I doing? Bill's advancing his career in Venezuela, there's a shareholders meeting that I should be at and I'm shooting the breeze with a short order cook!",
        "Buzz: What a nightmare that must be.",
        "Olivia: You know what I mean. I think you're a genius. You're a genius because I know what I have to do. I don't belong here, I don't belong back there. I'm a Lewis!",
        "Buzz: Because I'm a genius because I reminded you because you're a Lewis?",
        "Olivia: I'm Olivia Lewis. I may not have Bill, but there are other Lewis's. All is fair in love and business.",
        "Buzz: Why don't you stay and explore other options?",
        "Olivia: That's all right. Thanks. You're great.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: I could not have done this without you. It's crazy, isn't it? I never thought our paths would lead us to this moment! (Laughs).",
        "Gus: Me, either.",
        "Harley: I never thought that I'd be running Spaulding Enterprises! Oh, my gosh, it's huge. I'm getting nervous again. Hug me!",
        "Gus: Go out there and knock them dead, okay? Because you can do it. You can do it. Is.",
        "Harley: What would I do if I had never met you?",
        "Gus: I think you'd be all right.",
        "Harley: Well, I kind of love you.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: Okay. I can do this. I can do this. I can do this!",
        "Beth: I've got a piece of advice for you. Stop harping on my marriage. You need to work on your own.",
        "Gus: I'm not worried about my marriage.",
        "Beth: Oh, come on, Gus, the evidence is staring you right the face. You have to admit, it makes you wonder. If this much is true, what other chapters in Blake's book are right on the money? Maybe you can believe everything you read.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Aren't you going to grab a seat?",
        "Marina: No, I'd rather hang back here with you.",
        "Mallet: Good idea. I'm a lot of fun.",
        "Marina: Harley seems to think so.",
        "Mallet: Really? Did she say that?",
        "Marina: Not in so many words but you guys are friends, right?",
        "Mallet: Sure, old pals.",
        "Marina: You are?",
        "Mallet: Yeah. I mean, she's impossible and she's stubborn and she talks when she should be listening and she listens only when her ear is to the door or she's attached to system surveillance system. But me? I... I understand her better.",
        "Marina: So you get along.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, we get along.",
        "Marina: Even though you guys were husband and wife it's not weird or anything?",
        "Mallet: It's kind of weird.",
        "Marina: But it's not like that for everyone, right? Some people are friends with their ex-spouses.",
        "Mallet: Some people are friends with their dead spouses.",
        "Marina: Then you guys made good with the past and moved on, right?",
        "Mallet: I'm your superior officer. I've never had a conversation with this with one of my cadets. Where am I?",
        "Marina: A meeting.",
