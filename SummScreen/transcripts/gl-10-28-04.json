        "Father Ray: Make it two club sodas.",
        "Danny: Hey.",
        "Father Ray: Hey.",
        "Danny: Somebody call for a priest? I don't think I did.",
        "Father Ray: How about a cousin?",
        "Danny: Ray, well, to be honest with you, I don't think you're going to want to hang out with me tonight.",
        "Father Ray: I can take it.",
        "Danny: Okay.",
        "Father Ray: I heard Michelle left town.",
        "Danny: Yeah. Well, I'm sure you heard a lot things. Did you also hear the little rumor that Tony went with her?",
        "Father Ray: That's no rumor, Danny. Tony and Michelle ran off together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: We're not rocking and rolling anymore.",
        "Tony: And the wind stopped. For now at least.",
        "Michelle: Did the storm pass?",
        "Tony: Well, I hope so. The radio's still dead. It could just be low. I'm not sure.",
        "Michelle: Okay, we've got to get to land, Tony, while things are calm.",
        "Tony: Well, there's an idea.",
        "Michelle: Do you think Holly's okay?",
        "Tony: I hope so, Michelle. She's Sebastian's bargaining chip to get you to deliver your dad to him. Why...",
        "Michelle: Why? Why does he want my dad?",
        "Tony: Listen. Hey, hey, we can't worry about that right now.",
        "Michelle: Do we even know where we are?",
        "Tony: We will when those skies clear. So we just have to use dead reckoning and follow the stars.",
        "Michelle: I don't know what dead reckoning is, but I'm not liking the sound of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: Do you remember these caves?",
        "Holly: Chip off the old block. Make me relive the worst moments of my life. Roger would be proud of you.",
        "Sebastian: This isn't about tormenting you, Holly. This is about setting you free, and you know that.",
        "Holly: Setting me free. I was never free with Roger. I was always his prisoner. And he kept dragging me deeper and deeper into his own hell. You suppose that's where he is right now?",
        "Sebastian: When are you going to stop vilifying him every time you open your mouth?! This is where it ends, Holly. All of it. Right here and right now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: It's \"taken care of,\" as in, it will never be found. Correct? Yeah, well, you'd better be sure.",
        "Frank: Am I interrupting something?",
        "Phillip: Oh, no. Not at all, Frank. Please, come on in. Thank you for coming.",
        "Frank: Phillip, exactly what do you want?",
        "Phillip: I'd like to try to find some way to help with the investigation.",
        "Frank: Such as?",
        "Phillip: Well, I thought maybe I could post a reward for the arrest of the hit-and-run driver. Maybe $50,000. What do you say?",
        "Frank: I say, what's in it for you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Oh, no, no. Hey, I'm going with you.",
        "Ruth/Harley: What for?",
        "Bill: Because I'm going to make sure Phillip doesn't try anything.",
        "Ruth/Harley: Like what?",
        "Bill: Harley, this guy flattened your house for the fun of it. Now you're going to let on that you know about the accident?",
        "Ruth/Harley: Yeah, but I...",
        "Bill: Don't you think there's nothing he wouldn't do to keep this from getting out?",
        "Ruth/Harley: Okay, but I am offering the man my undying silence and support.",
        "Bill: Well, I still don't like it.",
        "Ruth/Harley: Okay, how about this? I will call you when it's over, and I'll tell you what happened. How's that?",
        "Bill: All right, but listen to me. If you meet him at towers do not, and I mean do not, go out on the balcony with him.",
        "Ruth/Harley: (Laughs)",
        "Bill: I'm serious. Let me fix this hairline, because I think it has to come... I think it's a little... oh, I just think...",
        "Ruth/Harley: Gee, thanks. What would I do without you?",
        "Bill: I just wanted to make it look real.",
        "Harley: Thank you.",
        "Gus: Hey.",
        "Bill: Hey, Gus.",
        "Gus: How are you?",
        "Bill: Psst. It's Gus.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tony: Listen to me, Michelle. Hey, we are going to get through this, all right? We will. I want to get my hands on Sebastian. That's the only thing I want to do.",
        "Michelle: You know, Tony, I am not completely convinced that he's all bad.",
        "Tony: What are you talking about?",
        "Michelle: All right, he did bail on us.",
        "Tony: Yeah, he did.",
        "Michelle: He's holding Holly to get my dad, but I don't know. I just get this feeling that something good is going to come out of this.",
        "Tony: Well, I will leave you to your positive thoughts.",
        "Michelle: Where are you going?",
        "Tony: I'm going to go get the winch working. Because if I can't start the engines, we can't drop anchor. I don't think the captain's coming back any time soon, Michelle. We've got to get out of here. You know, the wind's picking up. Are you going to be okay here by yourself? You're sure?",
        "Maureen's voice: Michelle. Michelle, don't be afraid.",
        "Michelle: Mom?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: Say what you want about Roger Thorpe, but the man died with your name on his lips.",
        "Holly: That doesn't mean I have to...",
        "Sebastian: He spent his every last moment, his last final moments of his life thinking about you. Doesn't that touch you in any way? Who is the real monster here, Holly?",
        "Holly: Look, I didn't have to go with you on this little expedition. I didn't have to get on that plane in Springfield or get on that boat and then walk into that hotel room or walk out of that. But I did. Now I could just walk right out of here right now.",
        "Sebastian: Oh, could you?",
        "Holly: Yeah.",
        "Sebastian: Yeah. Okay. Then go ahead. Because you know what? I'm done. You are free.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: Frank, I am a concerned citizen. I'm also a father. My daughter went to a party at that bar tonight. If there's some nut out there targeting pedestrians, I'd like him to be caught out and out before he kills somebody.",
        "Frank: What makes you think the driver's a \"he\"?",
        "Phillip: Well... I just naturally assumed. Why? Is there some lead that points to a woman?",
        "Frank: Look, Phillip, I appreciate your offer, but I'm going to have to say no.",
        "Phillip: Why?",
        "Frank: Why? Well, because a reward's already been posted. And we will catch this man or woman. Just a matter of time. Not money. Look, I know Lizzie's been through a lot--just like Marina.",
        "Phillip: Yes, she has.",
        "Frank: You know there really isn't anything we wouldn't do to protect our daughters, is there?",
        "Phillip: Nothing.",
        "Frank: That's what I thought.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: All right, Ruth, let's see what you're up to.",
        "Ruth/Harley: He cannot know I'm here.",
        "Bill: I know. Hey, sorry about that. I just...",
        "Gus: No, it's all right. Can I come in? Do you mind?",
        "Bill: Actually, I'm a little busy. But if...",
        "Gus: You don't look busy. I mean, unless... do you have... I mean, is somebody here?",
        "Bill: No. Official visit or...",
        "Gus: Well, semi. I wanted to talk about somebody that works at Spaulding.",
        "Bill: Uh, who?",
        "Gus: Ruth Karloff, an ex- employee of yours.",
        "Bill: Yeah. Nothing really to tell. Just had a falling out. So...",
        "Gus: Well, you know that much I knew. I wanted to know a little bit more, like what kind of person was she? Or...",
        "Bill: Well, why do you ask?",
        "Gus: Well, I see this one side to her. I don't know if you remember, like this prudish, workaholic type, you know, with the sex appeal of an orthopedic shoe. But then I see this, like, this self-serving operator, you know.",
        "Bill: You know, I don't know too much about that sort of thing. But listen, why would I want to help you anyway? She some sort of threat to the mighty Phillip Spaulding?",
        "Gus: Well, no, I didn't say that she's a threat to anybody. And as far as the other thing goes, I'm trying to make sure that the mighty Phillip Spaulding doesn't hurt anybody else.",
        "Harley: You may be too late.",
        "Gus: What are you doing here?",
        "Harley: Doing here? I'm actually looking for a towel. There were none in the bathroom.",
        "Bill: Oh, sorry.",
        "Harley: What's wrong?",
        "Gus: Just weird that... I don't know. Weird that you're here.",
        "Harley: Why? Why is it weird? I mean, you know, we're partners. We're partners. And so we've been spending time together. We've actually been spending a lot of time together lately.",
        "Gus: Does Olivia live here with you or...",
        "Bill: Yeah. Yeah, look, weren't you here to pick my brain about Ruth Karloff?",
        "Harley: Who's that?",
        "Bill: Just some lady who used to work for me. You don't know her. But, anyway, I really have nothing more to add.",
        "Harley: And we're kind of busy.",
        "Bill: Right now.",
        "Harley: We have work we're finishing up.",
        "Gus: It's all right. Thanks, though. I thank you.",
        "Bill: All right.",
        "Harley: That was close. And now I'm late. I have to re-Ruth.",
        "Bill: Harley?",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Bill: You kind of led Gus to believe that, you know, we might be an item.",
        "Harley: Yeah. Well, that was just to keep him off balance, you know, until we figure out which side he's actually on, the Spaulding's or ours. He has been known to protect his family, you know. He could opt to pull Phillip's bacon out of the fire instead of turning the heat up on the guy. Like we are.",

        "Holly: We're lost, aren't we? We're lost, aren't we?",
        "Roger: Shut up. Shut up. Shut up, I said.",
        "Holly: We're lost.",
        "Sebastian: Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! I'll kill you. I'll kill you. Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!",
        "Holly: (Screaming) Sebastian?! Sebastian?!",
        "Sebastian: You looking for the way out? Do you want me to show you?",
        "Holly: The only way out is through, right? I want to come with you.",
        "Sebastian: Are you sure that's what you want?",
        "Holly: I want to put all this to rest. Everything that happened with Roger down here. (Crying) and every... every bit of violence, manipulation. It's just... it's all changed me in ways I know I still haven't recovered from. I got to the point I didn't even recognize myself. Before I bottomed out, I hurt the people I love really badly. I've had to let go a lot more than you know. And I want to let go of this. So go on. Take me there.",
        "Sebastian: Okay. It's this way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maureen: There's no need to be afraid, sweetie. You're my brave Michelle. You remember.",
        "Michelle: Mommy, I don't want to go in. The waves are so big.",
        "Maureen: Don't worry. I'll watch you.",
        "Michelle: I'm scared. I'll drown.",
        "Maureen: You won't drown. I would never let that happen to you. Never. Never. Never.",
        "Michelle: Promise?",
        "Maureen: CRoss my heart. Go on, sweetie. Be brave. You can do it. Be brave. Be brave. Be brave. Be brave, Michelle. Be brave.",
        "Michelle: Be brave. Tony? Tony, it just happened again. I was holding on to this coin and I had the most incredible memory of my mom and me at the beach when I was a kid. What? What's going on? What happened?",
        "Tony: Michelle, I tried to start the engines. They're dead. The anchor winch? Forget it. All right, I looked at the horizon. There's a wall of black clouds out there, and there's a storm coming in.",
        "Michelle: More rough weather?",
        "Tony: The lull is over.",
        "Michelle: Bring it on.",
        "Tony: Michelle, this is not a game. This is our life.",
        "Michelle: Look, Tony, we made it through last night. We'll make it through today. Okay?",
        "Tony: Oh, god. Here we go again.",
        "Michelle: What is going on?",
        "Tony: Well, there's good news and there's bad news, Michelle.",
        "Michelle: All right, give me the good news first.",
        "Tony: We don't have to worry about the anchor anymore.",
        "Michelle: Why not?",
        "Tony: Anchor chain broke.",
        "Michelle: Which is the bad news?",
        "Tony: That right there. That's the bad news. You ever see \"The Perfect Storm?\" Huh? You will tonight.",
        "Michelle: All right, we're going to be okay.",
        "Tony: Mm-hmm.",
        "Michelle: All right, Tony.",
        "Tony: Yes.",
        "Michelle: I mean it. Just because we're worried, doesn't mean things aren't going to work out all right. That's what my memory was about.",
        "Tony: Mm-hmm.",
        "Michelle: Tony, I want to tell you about it, okay?",
        "Tony: Not now, okay?",
        "Michelle: No, listen to me. Listen to me.",
        "Tony: What, Michelle? What?",
        "Michelle: This is what my memory's about. I was on the beach. I was with my mom. I was like seven, eight. I don't know. I don't know, but I was terrified of the ocean. I was completely freaked out. I thought if I went in I was going to drown.",
        "Tony: So you didn't go in the water. Okay.",
        "Michelle: No, no, no. That's just it. My mom looked at me and she told me to be brave. Okay. She gave me the courage to walk acRoss that beach and into that water. And I was okay. Everything was okay.",
        "Tony: That's a good memory. It is. And you need to hold on to that right now, because in a couple of hours you're going to need it, Michelle. You know what? I'm sick of this. Michelle, you have to listen to me, all right? All right, look at me. I didn't pull you out of a burning warehouse, okay? I didn't put up with you that night when you jumped in the falls, right? Okay, and all your other crazy stunts, I didn't put up with that to lose you right now. I will not let that happen. I promise you that, okay? I promise you that.",
        "Michelle: I don't want to lose you, either.",
        "Tony: It's not going to happen. Come here. Everything's going to be fine, all right?",
        "Michelle: (Gasps)",
        "Tony: It's okay. It's all right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: I've never been here before. Another one of Roger's haunts?",
        "Sebastian: I think you've heard of it, the Island of Lost Souls.",
        "Holly: Oh, yes. Before he came back to Springfield. Another stop on the magical mystery tour.",
        "Sebastian: Postcard available in the gift shop.",
        "Holly: Island of Lost Souls. I always thought that name was appropriate.",
        "Sebastian: Yeah. This place spoke to Roger. He came here long after he left Springfield.",
        "Holly: He did?",
        "Sebastian: Yeah. And this is where he died, Holly. But he hardly died alone. These gave him strength and real joy.",
        "Holly: It's too bad he didn't have that strength to fight his demons when he was still alive.",
        "Sebastian: Well...",
        "Holly: Might have made a difference.",
        "Sebastian: There may still be a chance.",
        "Holly: What do you mean? He's dead.",
        "Sebastian: You hungry? Thirsty?",
        "Holly: I'd really like a phone so I could call Blake and let her know I'm all right.",
        "Sebastian: Sorry, Holly, no phone service on this island, landline or cell. Makes for a certain solitude.",
        "Holly: This is why you didn't say anything when I said he was dead. Because he isn't? He's alive? And he's here?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: What are you doing here?",
        "Danny: What do you mean, what am I doing here? What are you doing here? This is Michelle's property. It's her home.",
        "Blake: Yeah, it's hers. It's not yours.",
        "Danny: What... what? I'm not allowed to come here?",
        "Blake: Oh, Danny. Well, we both know that Michelle is not around. So you didn't come to see Michelle. And even if you did, she wouldn't have seen you.",
        "Danny: Wow. Man, you are a barrel of laughs when you first wake up, aren't you?",
        "Blake: But am I wrong?",
        "Danny: For your information, I came here, yeah, to be nearer to Michelle. And I thought that... when I thought someone was under the covers... look forget it. It doesn't... it's stupid. Forget it.",
        "Blake: It's not stupid. It's not stupid. It's just wrong. We both know you can't turn love on and off like a switch, right?",
        "Danny: What are you doing here, goldilocks?",
        "Blake: Well, I had a huge fight with Ross, okay, and I couldn't bear to see him. I couldn't bear to go home.",
        "Danny: You couldn't, what, just get a room in a hotel somewhere?",
        "Blake: We live at a hotel. The mayor's suite is at the beacon. And that's where Ross is. That's where everyone is. And I just didn't want to see anybody, okay? I needed quiet. I thought I could come somewhere where I could...",
        "Danny: Be alone?",
        "Blake: Well, it almost worked.",
        "Danny: I guess we both came here for the same reason.",
        "Blake: And we both came up empty. Couldn't even get the alone part right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: Okay, Ruth, what is it that you want?",
        "Ruth/Harley: Excuse me, sir?",
        "Phillip: Well, Lizzie's very upset. She said that you were questioning her very closely about that hit-and-run accident.",
        "Ruth/Harley: Yes, sir. Terrible thing, that, sir.",
        "Phillip: She said that you tried to convince her that you were on her side, but that it seemed very apparent to her that you were angling for some sort of confirmation on her part that a member of our family was somehow involved. So just tell me, what is this all about?",
        "Ruth/Harley: I found the car, sir.",
        "Phillip: The car?",
        "Ruth/Harley: Sir, I took the liberty of photographing the vehicle, because, sir, it matched the description in the paper, sir--the vehicle, sir, that hit the young man. Are they not one and the same, Mr. Spaulding?",
        "Phillip: Um... well, let me ask you. Ruth, I don't know if that's the same car. But what if there were some truth to this conclusion that you have drawn? What do you intend to do about that? Do you want to try to make some money off my family? Is that what you want?",
        "Ruth/Harley: Mr. Spaulding, I am not a blackmailer. Quite the contrary, sir. I am here to protect you. Of course, I would need to know what took place that evening.",
        "Phillip: You mean if in fact anything did take place, right?",
        "Ruth/Harley: Sir, I am aware you have been feuding with the Lewis's. It was Miss Lewis's son who was struck. Is that merely A...",
        "Phillip: A coincidence, Ruth. It's my experience that not much is a coincidence, Ruth. Just like no good deed, or a bad one for that matter, goes unpunished. Okay, Ruth, what do you say we just be honest with each other?",
        "Ruth/Harley: I would like that a lot, sir.",
        "Phillip: Yeah, me, too. Because, after all, this is probably the end of the line.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Gus, listen.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Frank: I'm glad I ran into you.",
        "Gus: Uh-huh.",
        "Frank: We've got a question for you about your brother. He put up a reward for the arrest of the hit-and-run driver.",
        "Gus: Really? Why?",
        "Frank: To the tune of $50,000.",
        "Gus: You're joking. Why?",
        "Frank: Well, I don't know. Hopefully you can tell me.",
        "Gus: I don't know. Maybe he's trying to get some decent publicity for the family for once in his life.",
        "Frank: I don't know.",
        "Gus: Or it could be Ruth's idea.",
        "Frank: Who's Ruth?",
        "Gus: Ruth Karloff. That's Phillip's new pit bull. She's out there with him right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: You see, Ruth, our association will have to end if I can't trust you. And I guess I can't.",
        "Ruth/Harley: Sir. Sir, this is proof, sir, that I am trustworthy.",
        "Phillip: Really?",
        "Ruth/Harley: Sure. I could have gone to anyone with this information. Instead, I came directly to you.",
        "Phillip: Yeah, why did you do that?",
        "Ruth/Harley: Sir, it is your interest that I serve. And, Frankly, you are far too important a figure to be brought down by an unfortunate incident. So indeed, if it was a grudge against the Lewis family that put you in the vehicle that night, sir...",
        "Phillip: No, that's not what I'm saying. It was... it was my driver who hit Reva's son. My former driver. And it was an accident. He was young and he was careless. And obviously I knew I couldn't keep him around any longer, but I didn't want to ruin his life. So I let him go quietly and I hid the car.",
        "Ruth/Harley: Very big risk to take, sir, for such a young and careless boy.",
        "Phillip: You never did anything stupid when you were younger? And it was worth it anyway, because if I had reported it, the media would have just used it as one more thing to hurt my family. Another outrage. And it doesn't matter because Sandy's fine. He's going to be just fine. And it was an accident. It really was. One caused by an unknown driver. And it has to stay that way. Do you understand me?",
        "Ruth/Harley: And you understand, sir, that you can trust me?",
        "Phillip: I'll tell you what, Ruth. Why don't you go back to your computer and see if you can figure out where the investigation stands?",

        "Danny: Monster.",
        "Blake: Of course he doesn't see it. I mean, he's her father. I mean, he's just blind to his little girl. Keeps comparing it to me and my father.",

        "Holly: Well, I understand the sentiment, but we all have to die.",
        "Sebastian: But a man shouldn't have to die before his time--not when he has so much to do and so much to give. That was a little dramatic of me, wasn't it? (Classical music playing)",
        "Holly: You're Roger's son. I remember that music. It used to calm Roger down when he was enraged. He was enraged a lot.",
        "Sebastian: Hey, I have something to show you. Do you remember it?",
