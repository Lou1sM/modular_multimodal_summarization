Reva helps Cassie deal with things by showing her an anger management trick. Pretending a pumpkin is Edmund she smashes it and agrees it makes her feel better. Reva tries to get her to smash another one thinking of it as Dinah and Cassie says that she is not as upset with Dinah since she can kind of understand why she did what she did. Mallet throws Dinah into the cell with Alan until he can move up her court appearance where he is \"put in charge\" of making sure that Dinah doesn't screw up again. She can't figure out why he is sticking up for her. Edmund dons a disguise and visits Alan at the jail where he asks for more help getting Cassie back. He hides when Mallet comes in with Dinah.

        "Cassie: You want to throw a pumpkin?",
        "Reva: No because I'd have to put the name of \"Reva\" on that one.",
        "Cassie: Oh, no, no, uh-uh. This is my pity party, I'm sorry. Who's that?",
        "Cassie: That's Diana. She's probably bringing the kids over for candy. Can you get the door, I'll get some candy.",

        "Sandy: What?!",
        "Ava: She's his fiance.",
        "Russo: He's already engaged to someone else? Time out. Sweetheart, infidelity equals megabucks in this state. Especially if this kid's family is as rich as you said they were.",
        "Ava: Who are you working for?",
        "Russo: You, Ava. All right, look over the papers again, sign them where I've marked and get them back to my office. I won't need to see you again. Good luck, kids.",

        "Sandy: Hey, how'd you pay for this?",
        "Ava: I have two jobs.",
        "Sandy: Well, I can't let you pay for this. I pushed for the divorce.",
        "Ava: So that you could start your life with Tammy.",
        "Sandy: Yes. It's the best thing for the both of us. That's exactly what you said to me when we got married.",
        "Sandy: Sorry. I'm... I'm sorry that it had to end this way. I'm... I'm sorry that it had to end this way.",

        "Mallet: Yeah, I'm responsible for you now. Didn't you hear the judge?",
        "Dinah: Why couldn't have you kept your mouth shut?",
        "Mallet: Because if I had, he would have thrown the book at you. Just do what you're supposed to do and we won't have a problem.",

        "Mallet: Alan, Blake was obviously inspired by her own imagination or her own love life. But you would know more about that with me, wouldn't you? Since she made her way through every man in your own family, including you. Ick.",
        "Alan: Yes, there were some good times, Detective. But if I were you I would send her some flowers. She has made you the hero of Springfield.",
