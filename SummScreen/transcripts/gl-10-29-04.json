        "Reva: I'll get it.",
        "Trick or Treaters: Trick or treat!",
        "Reva: Oh, you guys look great! Happy Halloween. Do you have the candy?",
        "Josh: Yeah. Got it right here. Hey, guys, how are you? You look good. Go ahead. Oh, you got it? Good. Okay, okay. Thank you. Reva, come on. Don't do that, all right? How many times are you going to try to call that kid?",
        "Reva: More than you know.",
        "Josh: He's not coming.",
        "Reva: He has a name. It's Jonathan. He's my son.",
        "Josh: I know that. But the fact is, he threatened you.",
        "Reva: He didn't try to hurt me.",
        "Josh: Reva, you tried to cover it with makeup but I can see the marks he left on your neck. Now, come on. He's not going to show his face in this house again. In fact, if he's smart, he's already gone. He's taken off and we will never see or hear from him again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Whoo-hoo! (Growls)",
        "Lizzie: (Screams)",
        "Tammy: I've been looking for you.",
        "Lizzie: Tammy, let me go. You made me drop Roxy. Stop it.",
        "Tammy: It is time for you to pay for what you did.",
        "Lizzie: You don't even know what you're talking about.",
        "Tammy: You witch! Sicking that freak, JB, on me. Did you think I wouldn't find out that he was my cousin?",
        "Lizzie: Your cousin?",
        "Tammy: Oh, drop the act, Lizzie. You knew all along that he's Reva's son.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, I can definitely see where you'd be bummed, there. I would be, too. Well, look on the bright side, Tammy, at least you only went out with him a few times. It's not like you slept with him. Oh, my gosh. You slept with your cousin. (Laughs)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Tammy, I know you're angry at me, but if you get this message, please call home. Thank you.",
        "Jeffrey: Trick or treat.",
        "Edmund: This is not a good time. Tammy's missing.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, I know. Cassie told me. That's why I'm here. Looks like you're stuck with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I warned you. Stay away from my children, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: Get lost. I'm eating.",
        "Cassie: You're done.",
        "Dinah: What is your problem?",
        "Cassie: You. You set up my daughter so that animal could violate her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: Ruth Karloff has become a liability that I can no longer afford and she has to go. Come over and meet me at towers. It has to be taken care of tonight. I'm sorry, Ruth. I've gone too far. (Glass breaking)",
        "Beth: Phillip?",
        "Phillip: Hey, Beth, hi. hi, Dad.",
        "Beth: Oh, my God.",
        "Alan: Phillip, your hand. It's bleeding.",
        "Beth: What happened?",
        "Phillip: Oh, look at that. Um, it's nothing. Really, it's okay. It's fine. Everything's under control.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: This is the spot. Where is the car? Phillip. Phillip got to it.",
        "Gus: Hello, Ms. Karloff.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Jonathan is dangerous, Reva. If I hadn't stopped him yesterday when I did, he might have killed you.",
        "Reva: No, Joshua, I put his hands around my neck because I knew he wouldn't do it. I called him on his own act. I knew he was making empty threats.",
        "Josh: But the very fact that he threatened you proves my point, Reva. He is not your son in any sense of the word. (Doorbell rings) I'll get it. What are you doing here?",
        "Reva: Is it...?",
        "Josh: Yeah, it's the other one.",
        "Reva: Sandy.",
        "Sandy: I'm sorry to bother you, but there's something you have to know before I leave for good. Five minutes is all I'm asking. It's about Jonathan. Thank you.",
        "Reva: So, what about Jonathan?",
        "Sandy: Reva, he knows that you want him in his life, and that's what he wants, too.",
        "Reva: I knew it.",
        "Sandy: But it's...",
        "Reva: See?",
        "Sandy: ...It's not how you think. He wants it so he can hurt you. What he did with Tammy is just the start of it. You're next.",
        "Reva: Oh, it's because he's angry. And why wouldn't he be angry? He was cheated out of his entire life. (Doorbell rings) I'll get that. (Gasps)",
        "Jonathan: Your candy or your life.",
        "Josh: Do you think that's funny? Do you think that's funny?",
        "Jonathan: Hey, easy. Easy, Mom. It's only me. Boo.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: You slept with your cousin? Ew! Ugh!",
        "Tammy: I didn't know. He did. He did it on purpose.",
        "Lizzie: Why?",
        "Tammy: He used me to get back at my family, my Aunt Reva. And you helped him.",
        "Lizzie: Tammy, honestly, I really did not know about this.",
        "Tammy: You're lying. You're lying just like you did to get Joey into bed with you. JB couldn't have gotten anywhere near me if it wasn't for you and your lies.",
        "Lizzie: Tammy, listen, I didn't even know JB, okay? All I know is that he saw you and he liked you and I thought if you liked him back then it would be easier for me to get Joey.",
        "Tammy: You are both sick and disgusting.",
        "Lizzie: I am? I wasn't the one who put out to my own cousin.",
        "Tammy: Shut up! Just shut your lying mouth!",
        "Lizzie: Oh, you know what? I see why this is such a sensitive subject to you, being your family history. Your mom being a stripper and getting paid to take her clothes off. Who knows what else she got paid for? I mean, she and your aunt had the same man, Prince Richard, in the sack. You are just destined to be trash, aren't you? You're doomed.",
        "Tammy: You're doomed, Lizzie. You're a horrible person who doesn't care about anybody but herself. You're just as sick as your father is, and that's why you're all alone now. All alone.",
        "Lizzie: No, I'm not. I'm not sick. I'm fine. She's wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: What you did to Tammy was cruel and unforgivable.",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Cassie: You knew that she was in Edmund's suite with that lowlife. You stood outside the bedroom door and you hustled me away when you knew she was in danger.",
        "Dinah: In danger? Your little girl is all grown up. If she wants to get it on with ??? going to happen.",
        "Cassie: Not with her cousin, Dinah, some sicko that's only after revenge.",
        "Dinah: Wait a minute. What are you... that guy was her cousin? What are you talking about?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. And you could have stopped him. All you had to do was tell me that she was in there with that guy.",
        "Dinah: Look, if you want to blame someone, put it where it belongs: On yourself. The way you've raised that kid, it's no wonder she's looking for love in all the wrong places.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: Beth, relax. You're making way too much of this. Let's just have a nice family dinner. I called Lizzie and I told her to meet us over here.",
        "Beth: Speaking of which...",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm?",
        "Beth: I'm worried about her, just like I'm worried about you.",
        "Phillip: Oh, that's all right. She'll be fine. I will be fine, too.",
        "Beth: No. Uh-uh. That's not good enough anymore.",
        "Phillip: Beth, she's... you know, she's been having some trouble since that Lupo boy walked out on her. It's all right.",
        "Beth: Phillip, this is more than just boy trouble.",
        "Phillip: Why? What did she say to you?",
        "Beth: You know, that she drugged him.",
        "Phillip: Oh, yeah.",
        "Beth: But now I'm hearing her crying in her room late at night, but when I go in and ask her what's going on, she says, \"I'm fine, Mom, everything's fine.\" I've walked in and I've seen the two of you with your heads together. So tell me what's going on with her.",
        "Phillip: Nothing's going on. You know, you should be happy that I have a close relationship with our daughter.",
        "Beth: Don't do that. Don't twist my words. We've been here before. I know the signs and so do you, and I don't want to be in the position of having to talk her down again from trying to hurt herself or somebody else.",
        "Phillip: Beth, don't overreact. All right? That's why she's not confiding in you. I'll handle it, all right? Just leave it to me.",
        "Beth: Don't shut me out. She's our daughter and whatever is going on with her, we should be there for her together, just like we used to be before...",
        "Phillip: Before what? Before I went crazy?",
        "Beth: I need you, Phillip. I need you to be the way you were before everything fell apart. You were kind and you were sensitive and sometimes now I don't know who you are.",
        "Phillip: The role of the sensitive Spaulding is now being played by Gus Aitoro.",
        "Beth: Are you happy being disliked and feared all over town?",
        "Phillip: My family and my children love me, Beth. Nothing else really matters.",
        "Beth: Okay. Fine. You do whatever you have to do, but don't keep secrets about our children. I wouldn't do the same thing to you. Tell me what's going on with Lizzie.",
        "Phillip: Beth, Beth. Don't you know by now? Sometimes it's better if you just don't know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: So, what are we doing? Bird watching?",
        "Ruth/Harley: Owls, Mr. Aitoro. Nocturnal, remember? We should get back.",
        "Gus: You know, I'm on to you, Ms. Karloff. So I say we stop playing games and just level with each other. Ladies first.",
        "Ruth/Harley: Well, sir, if you're on to me, then you must be here for the same reason that I am.",
        "Gus: And that would be?",
        "Ruth/Harley: To gather evidence against Mr. Spaulding and use it against him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Hey, I have an invite from the lady herself.",
        "Reva: Yes.",
        "Jonathan: Right, Mom?",
        "Reva: Yes, yes. That's right, Joshua. Please.",
        "Sandy: Trick or treat elsewhere, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, pipe down, tough guy. I'll only be a minute. I just want to tell mommy dearest to back off. Stop harassing me.",
        "Reva: You could have said that on the phone. You wanted to see me.",
        "Jonathan: You think?",
        "Josh: Back off.",
        "Reva: Stop it. Stop it, both of you. Jonathan and I have a lot to work out.",
        "Jonathan: Or not. I can walk away right now. You never have to see me again.",
        "Reva: No.",
        "Jonathan: Good. Good. Because I wanted to see you again, too. I can't stop thinking about that hug you gave me. She's something, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Tammy.",
        "Edmund: No, no. But I heard from someone else.",
        "Cassie: Oh, thank you so much for getting here so fast. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I should have told you, okay.",
        "Edmund: No, really, no harm done.",
        "Cassie: I need your legal advice. What charges can we bring against JB, or Jonathan, or whatever the hell his name is?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, yeah, Josh came to me earlier trying to nail him.",
        "Edmund: Anything you could do? Fraud charges, perhaps?",
        "Jeffrey: Fraud? Well, Sandy maybe, but not Jonathan, no.",
        "Cassie: He came to this farm under false pretenses.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, did he break in or did Tammy invite him in?",
        "Cassie: He lied to Tammy, Jeffrey. He took advantage of her.",
        "Jeffrey: Mrs. Winslow, as much I'd like to nail this guy for what he did to Tammy, the sex was consensual.",
        "Cassie: Okay, but he tricked her and he used her, and he can't get away with that.",
        "Jeffrey: What he did was not a crime.",
        "Cassie: He could still be a danger to Tammy and the rest of our family.",
        "Jeffrey: The law is the law, Mrs. Winslow. I mean, as long as he hasn't committed a crime, I can't do anything about it.",
        "Edmund: Well, I suppose there are other ways of dealing with it.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, I didn't hear that, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Mm. (Phone rings) sorry. Got to get this.",
        "Jeffrey: Look, if JB so much as litters, I'll have Frank Cooper haul him in, okay? How's that?",
        "Cassie: There's something really wrong with this world when a freak like JB can just go around and ruin people's lives and turn people into victims and no one can stop him.",
        "Jeffrey: This is about more than JB, isn't it?",
        "Cassie: I stopped by towers on the way home to see if Tammy was there and I ran into Dinah, who found it amusing that Tammy had been taken advantage of. And she was the one person who could have stopped it from happening.",
        "Jeffrey: Stopped it? What do you mean?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, she knew that Tammy was in that hotel room with JB, and she had the opportunity to tell me and she deliberately didn't. But you know what, Jeffrey? Your girlfriend has a lot of secrets, like the fact that you have a picture of me and Richard locked away in your safe. What's that all about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Tammy?",
        "Tammy: (Sighs) now my night is perfect.",
        "Dinah: Are you okay?",
        "Tammy: Stay away from me.",
        "Dinah: Okay. Whatever. Look, I thought maybe we were okay, the two of us, because I kept your secret about the guy at your Uncle Edmund's apartment.",
        "Tammy: Thank you for reminding me. You know, it figures that you were there... like a bad luck charm.",
        "Dinah: I'm sorry. I know who he is. I know about the guy. I'm sorry.",
        "Tammy: Is it on the news now or something?",
        "Dinah: No.",
        "Tammy: Does everyone in town know that I slept with my cousin?",
        "Dinah: No. I ran into your mother.",
        "Tammy: Oh, well, at least she's only telling her good friends.",
        "Dinah: I'm sorry. I really am. If I can help in anyway, maybe I can make up for some things.",
        "Tammy: Just leave me alone.",
        "Dinah: Is that what you want? To do this all alone? Look, Tammy, I know that you don't have any reason at all to trust me, but if I had known who he was, I would have kicked him so hard in the crotch, he would have been joining the Vienna Boys' Choir. There's still time to give him what he deserves.",
        "Tammy: Revenge. That's all you know, isn't it?",
        "Dinah: You shouldn't knock it until you try it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ruth/Harley: What if you found out that your brother had done something terrible, something life threatening? Would you protect him or would you turn him in?",
        "Gus: Has my brother done something that I should know about?",
        "Ruth/Harley: Are you asking me? Aren't you the Spaulding consigliore?",
        "Gus: Have you been working against my brother since the beginning?",
        "Ruth/Harley: What if I have?",
        "Gus: Well, I would ask you who you're working for.",
        "Ruth/Harley: Fun, sir, aren't they? Hypotheticals? We should get back.",
        "Gus: Ruth? Phillip Spaulding doesn't play around. You're messing with a very, very dangerous game.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Mom, I need you.",
        "Beth: Honey, what is it? Hey. Hey. What's going on?",
        "Lizzie: I'm not a bad person, am I?",
        "Beth: No!",
        "Lizzie: It's just that Tammy said these bad things about me and it was awful and...",
        "Beth: Okay, okay. Well, you and Tammy have had a tough time of it. But still, if she's...",
        "Lizzie: Mom, I didn't mean to hurt her. I don't mean to hurt anybody and I just do. I'm scared, mom.",
        "Beth: Come here. Come here.",
        "Phillip: Dad, won't you go ahead in?",
        "Alan: No, Beth's taking care of Lizzie right now.",
        "Phillip: I'm not so sure.",
        "Alan: Oh, she's just a little concerned that Elizabeth's starting to exhibit some of the same behavior that she did a year ago when she was having all those problems with Olivia.",
        "Phillip: Well, you know, sometimes the way Beth acts it makes Lizzie doubt herself and then she just acts like she's feeling guilty about something.",
        "Alan: Guilty? Guilty about what?",
        "Phillip: Oh, anything, you know. You name it. None of us can do the right thing 100% of the time. Everybody makes mistakes. Allowances have to be made.",
        "Alan: Phillip is... is... has Elizabeth done something that I need to know about?",
        "Phillip: Yes.",
        "Alan: Is it serious?",
        "Phillip: It could destroy her future. Our enemies could use it to destroy us all.",
        "Alan: What can I do to help?",
        "Phillip: I'll let you know if that day comes.",
        "Alan: Listen to me. Don't try to handle this alone. You need me. You need all of us now.",
        "Phillip: Dad, just be there for her, okay. No matter what happens. I'll take care of the rest of it.",
        "Alan: Are you sure?",
        "Phillip: Trust me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ruth/Harley: Thank you for the warning, Mr. Aitoro. But I can handle myself with Mr. Spaulding and anything he throws me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: Thank you for coming. Ruth Karloff has to disappear from Springfield tonight. For good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Get the hell out of here...",
        "Reva: Stop it!",
        "Josh: ...And do not come back!",
        "Reva: Joshua, stop it!",
        "Jonathan: Come on. Go big daddy.",
        "Reva: Jonathan. Stop it. Stop it.",
        "Sandy: He's not worth it.",
        "Josh: Do you hear me? Get out here.",
        "Jonathan: Come on, just one more punch.",
        "Josh: I'm fine. I'm fine.",
        "Reva: (Out of breath) all right. What are you doing?",
        "Josh: What am I doing? I don't know, Reva! But I can not stand here and let him pull this stuff!",
        "Reva: I just need some time with him. Please. We have things to work out.",
        "Josh: You want me to leave you alone in this room with him?",
        "Reva: Yes, I do. Otherwise things won't get settled between us. Now, please, please...",
        "Josh: Okay. All right. Fine, fine.",
        "Reva: ...Just go outside and calm down.",
        "Edmund: Hello?",
        "Josh: This is Josh Lewis. I need to see you.",
        "Edmund: It's not a good time. We can't find Tammy.",
        "Josh: Yeah, well, you know what this about Cassie and Tammy's safety, all right. Can you meet me at the towers?",
        "Edmund: Be there in 15 minutes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I don't need anymore advice about what I should do or how I should be feeling, especially not from you. I just want this to be over.",
        "Dinah: So people can stop giving you that poor little girl look, right? I know that one pretty well. I bet that Cassie is tiptoeing, trying to say the right thing, but she's just not getting it right.",
        "Tammy: Something like that.",
        "Dinah: And then I come along, give you the \"bring him down\" speech, and you just want to leave us all in the dust, huh?",
        "Tammy: Yeah.",
        "Dinah: So do it. Do it. Pick up and go and drive. That's what I do when things get too difficult. I get in the car and I drive and I drive until I decide to come back and deal with everybody on my own terms.",
        "Tammy: I would love to get out of here, but I can't just get in my car. It's registered in my mom's name. She would have the police after me in no time.",
        "Dinah: That's not a problem. Take mine.",
        "Tammy: You're serious?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. You owe it to yourself. I owe it to you, and it would be good for you.",
        "Tammy: Okay.",
        "Dinah: Good girl.",
        "Tammy: Thanks.",
        "Dinah: The one right down the alley. (Sighs) before long, Cassie, everybody that you love will be waving bye-bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: There's a meeting I forgot about at towers. I have to go make it. On the way, I'll look for Tammy as I go, all right?",
        "Cassie: Okay. Thank you.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, I guess I'd better hit the road, too.",
        "Cassie: Are you going to explain anything to me about that photo?",
        "Jeffrey: I'm not sure what you're talking about.",
        "Cassie: Edmund saw it, Jeffrey. He was in your hotel suite. Dinah showed it to yesterday.",
        "Jeffrey: Dinah showed it to him. Well, where did Dinah get it?",
        "Cassie: In your safe. Why would you have a picture of me and Richard locked up like that? Why?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, it was probably a file from a case. Yeah, when I was investigating Danny and your partnership with him. I left it in there. Why?",
        "Cassie: So Dinah's just making something out of nothing. That's all.",
        "Jeffrey: What? Did she have you believing that it was the need of a pathetic man who was obsessed with you and had to have you near him, even if it was just a photograph?",
        "Cassie: No. You know, no. I guess I'm never going to live it down.",
        "Jeffrey: Dinah is the one that's obsessed, Cassie, okay? She's obsessed with causing trouble and she's not going to change.",
        "Cassie: Then why are you involved with her?",
        "Jeffrey: I got a thing for danger. Don't you know that about me by now?",
        "Cassie: Where are you going?",
        "Jeffrey: I'm going to chase down a lead on Tammy. I'm going to have the police do some investigating on a certain Jonathan Randall. Maybe there's something in his history.",
        "Cassie: Thank you for everything. (Phone rings) hello?",
        "Tammy: Mom, it's me.",

        "Tammy: I'm okay. I didn't want you to worry about me.",
        "Cassie: Okay, well, why don't you come home so we can talk, okay?",
        "Tammy: I can't. I have to get out of here.",
        "Cassie: Where are you?",
        "Tammy: Please don't look for me.",
        "Cassie: Honey, come on, you got to tell me where you are.",
        "Tammy: I'm sorry. I love you.",
        "Cassie: Baby, I love you, too, but you got to... Tammy? Tammy? (Sighs)",

        "Gus: So what is the deal, Ruth? Do you have something against my brother or not?",
        "Ruth/Harley: Maybe.",
        "Gus: Well, if you do, I can't let you do anything that's going to hurt anybody else in this family. They've been through enough. (Phone rings)",
        "Ruth/Harley: Speak of the devil.",
        "Phillip: Ruth, Phillip Spaulding. I hope I'm not calling too late.",
        "Ruth/Harley: Of course not, sir. I'm available to you always. You know that.",
        "Phillip: Yes, Ruth, you've certainly proved your loyalty.",
        "Ruth/Harley: I'm glad I've earned your trust, sir.",
        "Phillip: And you know your instincts regarding Lizzie were also right. You've managed to get through to her when I could not.",
        "Ruth/Harley: I'm glad I was able to help.",
        "Phillip: Listen, Ruth, I wanted to ask you a favor. Lizzie has gone back over to that bar, J. Farley's, tonight and I'm a little concerned about her. I was wondering...",
        "Ruth: What is it, sir?",
        "Phillip: Well, if it's not too much trouble, I was wondering if you could go by there and pick her up.",
        "Ruth/Harley: No, sir. I just assumed she'd be with her driver, the Cooper boy. Isn't he there?",
        "Phillip: Well, see, that's the thing. I let him go early tonight. If you just wait outside for her, I told her to look for you.",
        "Ruth/Harley: I'm on it, sir. Don't worry, Mr. Spaulding. I will take care of Miss Lizzie.",
        "Gus: So, what \"mission impossible\" is Phillip setting you up on now?",
        "Ruth/Harley: Mr. Aitoro, I am headed to a bar. Please do not follow me, or I will have you arrested for har-assment.",
        "Gus: It's ha- rass -ment.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Take that.",
        "Jonathan: All right, look, I know I'm not welcomed here, so...",
        "Sandy: You're leaving. Good idea.",
        "Reva: Sit down.",
        "Jonathan: Yes, ma'am.",
        "Reva: Don't you have some packing to do, Sandy, upstairs?",
        "Sandy: It can wait.",
        "Reva: I will call you upstairs if I need you.",
        "Sandy: You're sure?",
        "Reva: Positive.",
        "Jonathan: See you, sandman.",
        "Reva: You can answer some questions.",
        "Jonathan: That goes both ways",
        "Reva: I will tell you anything you want to know. I realize I have years to make up for.",
        "Jonathan: I'll keep that in mind.",
        "Reva: Why are you so determined to fight me?",
        "Jonathan: I'm not. I don't give a damn about you. Honestly, I'm here to get my trust fund. Hooking up with my cousin was a bonus.",
        "Reva: Are you trying to destroy this family? I'm the one you're angry with. Leave the rest of them alone.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, aren't you the mother hen!",
        "Reva: I realized that I left you behind when you were too young to defend yourself, and I want to make up for that. And I can if you'll let me.",
        "Jonathan: What do you've got in mind?",
        "Reva: We have to deal with this face-to-face, as tough as that may be.",
        "Jonathan: (Scoffs) it's going to be tough on my body if your husband's around.",
        "Reva: He'll understand once he realizes that he doesn't have to protect me from you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: So what's this threat against Cassie and Tammy?",
        "Josh: It's Jonathan. He's been showing up at our house lately. In fact, I caught him with his hands wrapped around Reva's throat.",
        "Edmund: Is she all right?",
        "Josh: Yeah, she's fine. But, you know, who knows what this kid is capable of.",
        "Edmund: Well, thanks for the warning. Did Reva throw him out?",
        "Josh: No, she seems to be on some kind of a rescue mission where he's concerned.",
        "Edmund: Well, that doesn't surprise me.",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Edmund: So why come to me?",
        "Josh: Jonathan has to be stopped. I assumed you would feel the same way as I do about it.",
        "Edmund: So you're hoping I'm going to do the dirty work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: So Cassie told me about the stunt you pulled. A photo of her and Richard.",
        "Dinah: Was that Richard or just a stand-in? Just wondering.",
        "Jeffrey: You know I could have you arrested, breaking and entering, planting false evidence.",
        "Dinah: And lose your playmate? Now why would you want to do that?",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, just for the sheer enjoyment of watching you suffer, my dear.",
        "Dinah: You know your lady love tossed a glass of water in my face tonight. I bet you she didn't tell you that.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you know Cassie's a little worried right now about her daughter.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I know. She told me about Tammy and it doesn't sound very good. Why are you not trying to score extra points with Cassie right now and helping her finding her troubled teen?",
        "Jeffrey: I am. I'm working on it.",
        "Dinah: Well, if you buy me another drink, I tell you where Tammy is.",
        "Jeffrey: Get your own drink.",
        "Dinah: She's in Chicago. Driving.",
        "Jeffrey: You're lying.",
        "Dinah: No. Not lying. As much as I hate Cassie, that little girl has been through enough. I know she sure isn't in any shape to be on her own. I hope you find her.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, I'll find her. But first I need to tell Cassie.",
        "Dinah: What about that drink, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Is Daddy going to join us?",
        "Beth: Yeah, he'll be here. Why don't we go ahead and order, hmm?",
        "Lizzie: Can I ask you something?",
        "Alan: Of course, sweetheart, you can ask us anything.",
        "Lizzie: I've been thinking a lot about Carl, the guy that, you know, I killed when I was little.",
        "Beth: Honey, has something happened to bring all that back up?",
        "Lizzie: Well, do you remember how right after that I got sick with leukemia?",
        "Beth: Yes. Of course. That was a terrible time for all of us.",
        "Lizzie: Do you think maybe it was like payback? Like, I don't know, like bad karma, like all the bad things you do, it just comes back to haunt you.",
        "Beth: Honey, you did not get sick because you shot Carl.",
        "Alan: Of course not. You talk about karma, Elizabeth. Think about your healing. Your healing was nothing short of a miracle.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I know. But I've done things since then. I've done bad things since then.",
        "Beth: Whatever it is, you know that you can tell us. Nothing's going to happen to you.",
        "Lizzie: I'm worried about daddy and what's going to happen to him.",
        "Gus: Good. Just the man I need to see.",
        "Phillip: Hey. Join the party. Got the whole family here.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Phillip: Yeah, I got Alan, Beth, Lizzie. We're all here.",
        "Gus: Lizzie, huh?",
        "Phillip: Yeah. Come on, join us.",
        "Gus: No, I can't. I'm working. I want to ask that Ruth Karloff a couple of questions. Do you know where I could find her?",
        "Phillip: No, I don't know. I would imagine she's probably at home with her feet up watching some nature special on public television.",
        "Gus: Hmm.",
        "Phillip: Although I guess she could have a secret life we don't know about it.",
        "Gus: (Laughs) maybe she's the Spaulding mole, eh?",
        "Phillip: I would think Ruth is a long shot.",
        "Gus: Well, maybe. I'd still like to follow-up.",
        "Phillip: Why? What is this all about? I think we've been over this before. She's a model employee. I trust her completely.",
        "Gus: Yeah. Okay, then. So there's no problem if I follow-up, right?",
        "Phillip: No, it's no problem. Be my guest.",
        "Gus: Okay. Okay, okay. I'll give her a call. Thanks.",
        "Phillip: Okay.",
        "Gus: Come on. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: I don't actually need your help to stop Jonathan. I'm just looking for some ideas on how to do it.",
        "Edmund: All right. How far are you willing to go to get rid of him?",
        "Josh: I want him out of our lives forever.",
        "Edmund: Well, the old me probably would have started...",
        "Josh: Let me stop right there. You know, I never really subscribed to this \"old Edmund/new Edmund\" theory. I just think you haven't had a reason lately, you know, a cause.",
        "Edmund: And now I have one?",
        "Josh: Maybe so. But just for argument's sake, let's hear what the old Edmund would have done.",
        "Edmund: Well, I don't know if the answer's going to help you, Josh.",
        "Josh: Try me.",
        "Edmund: All right. We'll start at the bottom and work the way up to the top. But I think while I'm doing that you need to think about how you're going to feel if Reva finds out what's going on. Because, after all, he is her son.",
        "Josh: Jonathan is a threat to her and to my family. I'm going to do anything I have to do to protect them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: So why did you show up here tonight if you didn't want to work things out?",
        "Jonathan: Well, because your messages are clogging my voicemail, and this is the only way I knew I could make you stop.",
        "Reva: Well, you're here now. Why don't you stick around for awhile? (Knocking at door)",
        "Jonathan: What's that?",
        "Reva: (Laughs) boo! Trick or treaters. Probably at the back door. I'll be right back. You stay here.",
        "Jonathan: Bon voyage, sandman. You'll be glad to know that Mom's really warming up to me.",
        "Sandy: Leave her alone.",
        "Jonathan: Or what? What, you're going to push me off the side of a cliff? Oh, go lick your wound someplace else. This is my stomping ground now. And when I turn on my charms, all sorts of good things come my way. Just ask my little cousin Tammy. (Phone rings)",

        "Cassie: Hello?",
        "Dinah: Hi, is this Mrs. Cassandra Winslow?",
        "Cassie: Whose this?",
        "Dinah: I'm a booking agent with the Teezers Gentlemen's Club here in Chicago, looking for the legendary Shady Layne.",
        "Cassie: How did you get this number?",
        "Dinah: From your kid, Tammy.",
        "Cassie: Is she there?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, she sure is. She handed in her job application. She said she's 18. Can you back her up on that?",
        "Cassie: She's not 18. She's lying to you.",
        "Dinah: What's her birth year?",
        "Cassie: 1980. I mean, no... I mean, she's...",
        "Dinah: That's okay. Thanks. I got it.",
        "Cassie: No, listen to me. I want to talk to her right now. Please, put her on the phone.",
        "Dinah: Oh, I'm sorry, honey. She don't want to talk to you.",
        "Cassie: Let me talk to my daughter right now.",
        "Dinah: You know, we don't have many royalty's types around here. I think we're going to make a bundle off of her. It's in the genes.",
