        "Harley: Do you think Jude's mom and dad went a little overboard? ",
        "Rick: We've got a swing, a fire truck, and \r\nmore importantly, a basketball. ",
        "Harley: A basketball? ",
        "Rick: Yeah, the kid talked me into it. What \r\ncan I say? ",
        "Harley: The kid wasn't even there. \r\n",
        "Rick: Details, details. Hey, Coop. Got to \r\npractice up if you going to make the team. Come on. Want to see some dribbling. \r\nWant to see your moves. ",
        "Harley: Zach and Jude are sleeping, remember?\r\n",
        "Rick: You just didn't make the team. All \r\nright, we'll play the blocks. They're quieter. ",
        "Harley: Okay. ",
        "Rick: All right. ",
        "Harley: Are you glad you came along? \u00a0",
        "Rick: All right, do you want to play with the \r\nblocks or do you want to play with the train? ",
        "Harley: You bought a train? ",
        "Rick: Yes. ",
        "Harley: What train? ",
        "Rick: Well, I bet you didn't know that I also \r\nhappened to buy a cook book. ",
        "Harley: Oh. Would you look at this? \r\n",
        "Rick: I do it all. ",
        "Harley: I mean, look at this. This is like \r\ninstant family here. All the fun and lots of toys to play with, too. See, \r\nmarriage might not be so bad after all, Rick. All you have to do is say yes.\r\n",
        "_________________________________________",
        "\r\nGus: What? What? What? What? ",
        "Babe:\u00a0 you go after Danny even though he's \r\nprobably gone straight. And to get to him, you cut a deal with Carmen even \r\nthough we know that she's guilty. Why? ",
        "Gus: Look, Danny is as corrupt as they come, \r\nokay? He makes his mother look like Betty Crocker. ",
        "Babe: Funny. But I find that hard to believe.\r\n",
        "Gus: Well, that's what makes him so \r\ndangerous. People don't believe that he's doing what he is doing. ",
        "Babe: Are you sure that this isn't personal \r\nlike last time? ",
        "Gus: It isn't personal. ",
        "Babe: No, I mean it, Gus. People in the \r\nbureau are talking. ",
        "Gus: Well, then tell them do their job, get a \r\nhobby, whatever. Look, I said I would deliver Danny Santos, okay? I will-- and \r\nCarmen-- gift wrapped. ",
        "Babe: Rope, Aitoro. And then I hang you with \r\nit. ",
        "_________________________________________",
        "\r\nCatalina: Hey, buzz, there's no flirting with the customers, you know? \r\n",
        "Buzz: I own the joint and it's a free \r\ncountry. What... ",
        "Holly: This from Mr. \"Take back my sword \r\nfish, it taste funny, and where's the sparkling water I ordered?\" ",
        "Buzz: The fish did taste funny and I was \r\nthirsty. ",
        "Holly: But how can you, as someone who own a \r\nrestaurant, treat a waiter like that? ",
        "Buzz: You're talking about last night? \r\n",
        "Holly: Yeah, as a matter fact I am. You \r\ntreated that guy like nothing. ",
        "Buzz: Well, well, yeah, I did. I don't know \r\nwhy I did. No, I do know why I did. It's all your fault. ",
        "Holly: No, no, no ",
        "Buzz: Absolutely. Look, I always try, you \r\nknow, when we're out to have things perfect. I'm too anxious about that. So I go \r\noverboard. ",
        "Holly: Yeah, you do. You know, I have an \r\nidea. I could do something that would help you to control yourself in public.\r\n",
        "Buzz: To hold back. ",
        "Holly: Yes, let's say I did like... Like \r\nthis. ",
        "Buzz: Uh-huh. ",
        "Holly: That means... ",
        "Buzz: That means get a grip on it. \r\n",
        "Holly: Exactly. ",
        "Buzz: Okay. ",
        "Catalina: Hi, Tony. ",
        "Tony: Hi, yourself. ",
        "Buzz: Look at... Look at the way he's... I \r\nwas just going to... Well, don't break it (laughs) ",
        "Richard: Coast Guard what do you mean he's \r\nnot there? Find him and have him call me immediately. Where could he have taken \r\nher? ",
        "Dax: Richard, please, Alonzo may not be to \r\nblame for Cassie's, uh... ",
        "Richard: What? Disappearance? Abduction? Take \r\nyour pick at this point. I think the words are interchangeable. ",
        "Dax: Perhaps it might be better if you took a \r\nbit of a rest. ",
        "Richard: I'm fine. ",
        "Dixie: You've been up all night. ",
        "Richard: Do you actually think I could sleep \r\nnot knowing Cassie's whereabouts? How could she just wander off with someone \r\nlike that? ",
        "Dax: Richard, Alonzo's a friend. ",
        "Richard:\u00a0 A friend. Why do you keep on \r\npersisting on defending the man? Walton thinks he's nothing short of a sexual \r\npredator. Don't you think it's a little bit odd that she just vanished, \r\ndisappeared without a word. Oh, wait a minute. There was a word. \"I'm fine. \r\nDon't worry.\" Don't worry, Dax, I'm very worried! Damned worried! ",
        "Dax: If it were a true kidnapping we would \r\nhave been contacted about a ransom by now. ",
        "Richard: Maybe and maybe not. ",
        "Dax: Richard, after what Cassie suffered \r\nunder Edmund's hands, it's understandable for you to be more protective than \r\never. But what exactly is it that concerns you about Alonzo? Do feel that he has \r\ndesigns on Cassie? (Phone ringing) or that he might tell her about the papers \r\nyou had him sign relinquishing him from claim on young Will? ",
        "Richard: well where you? Never mind that. How \r\nsoon can you have the \"Gristede\" refueled? Five hours. I don't have five hours! \r\nI don't have five minutes, Dax. Have the helicopter brought into the launching \r\npad in the courtyard. I'll fly the bloody thing myself, but Cassie will be \r\nfound. ",
        "_________________________________________",
        "\r\nCassie: Alonzo? Alonzo? Great, don't tell me he left me. ",
        "Alonzo: You called? ",
        "Cassie: Yeah. ",
        "Alonzo: Morning. I know coffee would have \r\nbeen better, but that's all I can find on the boat. ",
        "Cassie: Oh, a girl could get use to service \r\nlike this. ",
        "Alonzo: swimming back to the main island as \r\nsoon as the tide turns. I hope it does it soon, though, too. The quicker we get \r\nyou back to your husband the better. ",
        "Cassie: Poor Richard. You know, I know he \r\ndidn't sleep a wink last night. I wish I could have got in touch with him.\r\n",
        "Alonzo: Pretty tough to do with the radio \r\nsmashed and your cell phone awol. ",
        "Cassie: I know. I'm going to have that cell \r\nphone welded to my wrist. ",
        "Alonzo: You know what? El presidente has \r\nprobably got me pegged as a wife snatcher right now. ",
        "Cassie: What? That's in your head, not his. \r\nIf anything he's going to worry less because he knows that I'm with you. Because \r\nhe trusts you. ",
        "Alonzo: Don't be so sure about that. \r\n",
        "_________________________________________",
        "\r\nRick: Harley, you can't assemble a marriage together like a bunch of building \r\nblocks. ",
        "Harley: Well, why not? If we have all the \r\npieces, why not? ",
        "Rick: That's just it. We don't have all the \r\npieces. ",
        "Harley: Well, hey, it's better than an \r\narranged marriage, right? At least you know what's underneath my veil. \r\n",
        "(Laughs) ",
        "Rick: Uh, check, please. ",
        "Harley: And we like each other, and we get \r\nalong really well, and we have fun together. ",
        "Rick: What are you doing? Stop this. \r\n",
        "Harley: (Laughs) ",
        "Rick: So there've fun and we made a great \r\nbaby together. But there's some details missing that concern me like... Like the \r\nmarriage part. ",
        "Harley: Yeah. No, I understand, because \r\nremember that concerned me, too, before, back when I turned you down the first \r\ntime. ",
        "Rick: Yeah, I remember that. ",
        "Harley: But things change, Rick. And now, I \r\ndon't see a reason why we shouldn't tie the knot. ",
        "Rick: What kind of knot were you thinking \r\nabout? ",
        "Harley: No, no. See, I know what you're \r\ndoing. You can hem and haw your way through this thing from here to eternity. If \r\nI don't give you a deadline... I'm giving you a deadline whether you want it \r\nnow. ",
        "Rick: deadline? ",
        "Harley: You're getting a deadline. I am \r\ngoing, and I'm going to take these new baby pictures down to my dad, and when I \r\nget back I expect the answer from you that I've been looking for. ",
        "Rick: Oh, this is just what I need, another \r\nwoman telling me what to do. ",
        "Harley: You love it. ",
        "Rick: I expect to be courted. I don't want to \r\nrush into things. I like to take my time. ",
        "Harley: (Laughs) Good, well, I'll bring you \r\nback a heart-shaped box of candy, okay. ",
        "Rick: All right, thank you. Listen, so I look \r\nthat easy? A box a candy... You think that's all it's going to take for me? The \r\ndeal is when you come back, I'll make up my mind. That's the deal. ",
        "Harley: I knew you'd see it my way. Bye, \r\nsnookums. ",
        "Rick: Snookums? She's going to have to come \r\nup with a better name than snookums. I wish there was a recipe on how to have a \r\nhappy family. ",
        "_________________________________________",
        "\r\n\u00a0Tory: Here. In \"Hagner vs. Mishler,\" the court was urged to hold that the \r\nlegality of a search... ",
        "Ross: No, no, no. That's a garbage can case, \r\nall right? Would you keep looking? I'm going to say hello to my wife. Well, hey, \r\nJeff, how are you doing? ",
        "\u00a0Jeff: Glad to see you're not always in the \r\nlaw library. ",
        "Tory: Not always. ",
        "Ross: I don't even get a hello anymore?\r\n",
        "Blake: Well, you look busy. ",
        "Ross: I'm never to busy for you or for my \r\nBuzz. (Laughs) ",
        "Buzz: (Mumbling) ",
        "Ross: How's Harley and the baby doing? Does \r\nZach like his little brother? ",
        "Buzz: Oh, Rick's taking good care them, the \r\ngroup. ",
        "Ross: Rick's a good man. ",
        "Buzz: Yeah, he's finally somebody he can \r\ncount on I think. ",
        "Holly: Cute. ",
        "Blake: I wouldn't throw him out of the house. \r\nYou know what I mean. Mmm. ",
        "Holly: Mmm. ",
        "Blake: This could be promising. ",
        "Tory: It sounds nice, but I really don't have \r\ntime for a movie. ",
        "Jeff: You're not holding out for someone else \r\nare you? ",
        "Tory: Who would I possibly be holding out \r\nfor? Oh, don't be ridiculous. He's my boss. ",
        "_________________________________________",
        "\r\nCatalina: Tony, people are watching. ",
        "Tony: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let them. ",
        "Catalina: Um, I better take your order. What \r\nwould you like? ",
        "Tony: For now you can give me a club soda.\r\n",
        "Buzz: No flirting with the customers. \r\n",
        "Catalina: I'll get your drink. ",
        "Tony: Yeah, hurry back. Uh, Romeo, it's Tony. \r\nListen, the second you get this, you call me, all right. I need to know if Sam's \r\nbought that ticket to get out of town yet. ",
        "_________________________________________",
        "\r\nBabe: Time is running out.. ",
        "Gus: Look, don't. Please, I am delivering the \r\nkingpins of organized crime. I have to do it one at a time. You're acting as if \r\nI am chasing after some penny-ante drug pushers, and I resent that. I resent it. \r\nI am putting my life on the line. ",
        "Babe: Okay. I want a legit case, you got \r\nthat? No funny business. And if I hear that this is some sort of personal \r\nvendetta... ",
        "Gus: You\u2019ll get what you want. Okay",
        "Babe: Oh, I know I'm going to get what I \r\nwant. The question is, is if you're the man who's going to give it to me. \r\n",
        "Gus: Look, I'll tell you this one more time. \r\nI will deliver Danny Santos. I give you my word. ",
        "Babe: I don't want your word, Gus. I want \r\nresults. ",
        "_________________________________________",
        "\r\nAlonzo: People like your husband don't automatically trust people like me.\r\n",
        "Cassie: Nothing like a big fat generalization \r\nbefore breakfast. ",
        "Alonzo: I know what I'm talking about. \r\n",
        "Cassie: Well, you know what? This time, \r\nyou're wrong, because no one knows Richard Winslow better than this \r\nworking-class girl. And he's not paranoid. If anything he's the opposite, you \r\nknow. He's willing to give people the benefit of the doubt all the time. \r\n",
        "\u00a0Alonzo: He thinks I\u2019m a loose cannon.",
        "Cassie: No, he doesn't. He thinks you're a \r\nfree spirit, and that is not a judgment, Alonzo, it's an observation because you \r\nare a free spirit. But you also have integrity, and Richard knows that and I \r\nknow that. How do we know that? We know that because you proved it to us. \r\n",
        "Alonzo: Right. It's so well documented.\r\n",
        "Cassie: Is that an airplane? ",
        "Alonzo: I don't know. Sounds more like a \r\nhelicopter. Doesn't sound like it's stopping though. ",
        "Cassie: You know, you should learn to take a \r\ncompliment. ",
        "Alonzo: I don't need people putting me on a \r\npedestal, especially not the president's wife. ",
        "Cassie: Do we have a problem with our taste \r\nin heroes? ",
        "Alonzo:\u00a0 that's not very heroic. ",
        "Cassie: I'm serious, Alonzo. Why do you have \r\nsuch a hard time seeing yourself as an honorable man? That's how I see you. And \r\nto tell you the truth, that's why I was so surprised that you gave up Will so \r\neasily. ",
        "_________________________________________",
        "\r\nTory: Look, I really have to get back to work. ",
        "Jeff: Well, how about if we have dinner \r\nsometime? ",
        "Tory: Jeff, thank you, but I can't. \r\n",
        "Jeff: (Sighs) well, it's your loss. \r\n",
        "Blake: Friend of yours? ",
        "Tory: He's been in a few of my classes.\r\n",
        "Blake: He's pretty cute. Seems like he liked \r\nyou. ",
        "Tory: I'm still not over my husband yet. And \r\nbesides, I wouldn't go out with just anyone that comes along. ",
        "Ross: Tory, I think you will know when you \r\nare ready to date again. ",
        "Blake: Sure, and then you'll be ready for \r\ncute boys like that. ",
        "Ross: So you think Jeff is cute, huh? \r\n",
        "Blake: Sure, as younger boys go. (Laughs)\r\n",
        "Ross: Right answer, yes. Tory, do you have \r\ntime this afternoon to go over \"Murphy vs. Fraser\"? ",
        "Tory: Of course. ",
        "Ross: Great. ",
        "Tory: And actually, I made some notes on it.\r\n",
        "Ross: Good, good. I'll join you, but I have \r\nto file a deposition first and I'll see you both at home. ",
        "Blake: Oh. ",
        "Ross: Bye, beautiful. ",
        "Blake: So I really did think he was cute. (\r\nLaughter) you sure you're not interested? ",
        "Tory: He\u2019s nice just not really my type, you \r\nknow. ",
        "Blake: Yeah? What is your type? ",
        "Tory: Well, I like someone a little more \r\nworldly wise, you know. ",
        "Blake: Mmm, so do I. ",
        "Tory: Yeah, you know, a man who is \r\nintelligent, who appreciates intelligence in a woman, who's not intimidated by \r\nthat, you know. I guess someone like Stuart. So if I never get married again, \r\nit's a okay. As long as I graduate and pass the bar, I'll have my work. \r\n",
        "Blake: You know, it's not impossible to find \r\na man like that. I did. But if you want to score, you have to have the right \r\nammunition. ",
        "Tory: Ammunition? ",
        "Blake: The way you dress and carry yourself-- \r\nwell, it doesn't exactly scream \"available.\" If you used what you have, you'd be \r\nsurprised. I mean, you would meet men that you never knew existed. ",
        "Tory: Besides, I'm not... I'm not glamorous \r\nlike you are. You know, I know who I am and I accept that. ",
        "Blake: Do you? Have you ever looked in a \r\nmirror? ",
        "Tory: I know what I look like. ",
        "Blake: Have you... I mean, you have these \r\neyes and these cheek bones and the skin. You know, have the exact same coloring \r\nas Ross's daughter, Dinah. Same age, too. And she managed to turn herself into a \r\nlooker. If she can do it, you could do it. Have you ever had a makeover? \r\n",
        "Tory: No! And I don't want one. ",
        "Blake: Why not? ",
        "Tory: Because it's not me. ",

        "\r\nGus: Carmen, pick up, pick up. All right, look, when you get this message you \r\ngot to call me, because if we don't talk soon, this thing is going to blow up in \r\nour face. ",

        "\r\nHarley: These are good. ",

        "Gus: Can I have one of those, you think?\r\n",
        "Harley: No, you may not. ",
        "Gus: I just need a small one for wallet. Come \r\non, I birthed the kid. Aren't I considered like a godfather to him? ",
        "Buzz: Touch one of these and I\u2019ll knock your \r\nblock off. ",
        "Gus: You know what, buzz? Forget it, all \r\nright. ",
        "Buzz: All right. ",
        "Gus: So... How is he? ",
        "Harley: He is in the care of his father at \r\nour house. ",
        "Gus: Our house? ",

        "\r\nRick: Hey, Mel... ",
        "Mel: Hey. ",
        "Rick: What a great surprise. ",
        "Mel: I am so sorry to bother you. I know \r\nyou're on leave, but this just couldn't wait. ",
        "Rick: No, please, come on in. What's up?\r\n",
        "Mel: Um, it's Mr. Sanderson. I tried paging \r\nyou for hours, and then finally I went to your house and your aunt Meta gave me this. ",
        "\u00a0Rick: I\u2019ve got five messages on here.",
        "Mel: All from me. So your aunt said that \r\nHarley's moving back home. Is it true? ",
        "Rick: Um, well, as you could see she's... \r\nLook, um, I was just in the kitchen. Can I get you some cookies? ",
        "Mel: Are you moving in, too? ",
        "_________________________________________",
        "\r\nCassie: I just don't understand how someone can give up their child so easily \r\nwithout a fuss. To me it's the most amazing powerful bond there is. ",
        "Alonzo: And if I don't feel it, I'm a \r\nmonster, is that it? ",
        "Cassie: No. No, I just think you're missing \r\nsomething. I remember the first time Tammy saw the ocean. I took her to a beach \r\nin Texas. And when she heard the sound of the surf she sat straight up on her \r\nblanket and she looked towards the sound. And she got up on those fat little \r\nbaby legs of hers and she started running towards the water. I could barely keep \r\nup with her. And then when the water washed over her toes, she looked up at me \r\nwith such delight like she had found a new best friend. ",
        "Alonzo: Maybe she'll end up on a fishing \r\nboat.",
        "Cassie: Well, she could do worse. Yeah, I'm \r\njust telling you this because, you know, Will, he's already in my heart, just \r\nlike Tammy and R.J., And I just... I just think that's something you should \r\nexperience. ",
        "Alonzo: Is that why you keep trying to find \r\nthings for me to do around the palace, so I can be close to Will, maybe get the \r\nwhole heart buzz thing? ",
        "Cassie: Is that so terrible of me? \r\n",
        "Alonzo: No. It's just beyond my \r\ncomprehension. ",
        "Cassie: Why? ",
        "Alonzo: Because you really don't know me at \r\nall. So how come you care so much about how I feel? ",
