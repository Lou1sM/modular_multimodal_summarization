        "Buzz: The trip to England is a surprise for Ava. Did you book that? ",
        "Coop: No. Not yet. ",
        "Buzz: Coop, look, about, you know, the dinner tonight... ",
        "Coop: Stop, just... Cooper code. Cooper\r\ncode, no extra apologies, okay? Let's just forget about it and continue. ",
        "Buzz: No, I wasn't going to apologize. Hell,\r\nI'll make you a promise. I am... I'm out of the forcing family togetherness\r\nbusiness. I'm lousy at it. ",
        "Coop: Yeah, no kidding. ",
        "Buzz: But I'm not giving up on Olivia. ",
        "Coop: No kidding, take two. ",
        "Buzz: You probably think I'm crazy. I mean,\r\nI'm sure you say that behind my back, but I suddenly realized I don't have to\r\ndo a thing to bring Olivia and Ava closer together. ",
        "Coop: Yeah, because it can't happen. ",
        "Buzz: No, because someday, somehow, they\r\nwill form their own bond as mother and daughter. ",
        "Coop: You know, I'm\r\njust going to say this, again, to your face. Dad, you're crazy if you think\r\nthat. ",

        "Olivia: Can you come back during regular\r\nvisiting hours? ",
        "Ava: Stop. What do you think, this is a\r\njoke? This is not a joke to me. ",
        "Olivia: I'm not in the mood for this. Take\r\nit somewhere else. Hey. ",
        "Ava: Scary, isn't it? Yeah, I know exactly\r\nhow you feel. ",
        "Olivia: What do you want? You know about\r\nyour father. ",
        "Ava: I know what happened the night you got\r\npregnant, and that's it. No details. ",
        "Olivia: Why do you want to know more? ",
        "Ava: Because I want to know everything. ",
        "Olivia: What everything? Your father is a\r\nguy who took advance of me. How's that? ",
        "Ava: How's that? That could be a lie. You've\r\nbeen known to lie, to bend truth, hell, to even trash\r\nit. ",

        "Tammy: Hey. Just come right on in, really. I\r\ncan't believe you were just going to jet off to Paris without saying good-bye. ",
        "Cassie: Well, I left you the message. ",
        "Tammy: Thanks, thanks a lot. ",
        "Cassie: It was just a spontaneous,\r\nspur-of-the-moment kind of thing. ",
        "Tammy: No kidding. So the planes were\r\ngrounded for a few hours? ",
        "R.J.: Yeah, there were storms. ",
        "Cassie: There was storms\r\nso I just decided I would take advantage of the delay and pack a few extra\r\nthings and borrow your sweater. And see if I can get you to come to Company\r\nwith us because this one over here is starving. ",
        "R.J.: I want ice cream. ",
        "Tammy: Well, my sweaters are in there. ",
        "Cassie: Good, thank you. ",
        "Tammy: Where's Josh? ",
        "Cassie: He went to the office. He'll call\r\nsoon. Oh, this is the one. What? ",
        "Tammy: You're like a teenager with a crush.\r\nYou're all glowy and smiley. ",
        "Cassie: Why, thank you. I will take anything\r\nthat compares me to a teenager. But yes, it's true. Things are really falling\r\ninto line for me and Josh. So all that leaves left is for you\r\ntwo to go get something to eat. How about some ice cream? ",
        "Tammy: Okay. ",

        "Josh: You're hooked up to all this stuff in\r\nthe first place. ",
        "Reva: It's just a check up. ",
        "Josh: Reva, come on. ",
        "Reva: Really, it's just a pit stop. ",
        "Josh: Reva. ",
        "Reva: I just... I'm leaving, and you can\r\nleave, too. So just go ahead and... you need to go. ",
        "Josh: You don't look good, okay? ",
        "Reva: It's the hospital. Who looks good in a\r\nhospital? It's the lights. It\u2019s... lights. ",

        "Reva: I told you not to... ",
        "Josh: You told him not to what? ",

        "Billy: Home? You can't go home. ",
        "Reva: Just get out of here. ",

        "Olivia: What are you looking for? A framed photo of daddy? Maybe a bunch of love letters from\r\nhim with his friendship I.D. on top, his initials graved... engraved on the\r\nback? I don't even know his initials, Ava. You know what? Go just sniff around\r\nif it makes you happy. It's fine. You satisfied? ",
        "Ava: Do I look it? ",
        "Olivia: Let me give you some motherly\r\nadvice. Forget about your father, all right? Just swallow it hard and let it\r\ngo. ",
        "Ava: No, I'm not going to. ",
        "Olivia: Why? You have one parent that you\r\nhate. Why do you need another? ",
        "Ava: How do you know I'm going to hate my\r\ndad? Maybe my father, I'll love him the way that I loved the mother who raised\r\nme. ",
        "Olivia: Oh. Nice. So you don't really want\r\nto truth, you just want a fairy tale ending. Is that it? Let me tell you\r\nsomething, there is no glass slipper in this story. There is no happy ending.\r\nThere is no prince, certainly. Nothing but booze and darkness\r\nand humiliation. That night changed me forever. It changed everything.\r\nYou need to go. ",
        "Ava: It is not my fault. ",
        "Olivia: Rape and assault and a lecture. ",
        "Ava: I didn't ask to come into the world\r\nlike this, okay? It's something that I have to deal with. So here I am. ",
        "Olivia: So what? Sweet, sunny Ava sees the\r\npositive side of everything and I should, too? ",
        "Ava: That is not what I'm saying. ",
        "Olivia: Don't you understand? Every time I\r\nsee you, it takes me back to that night. You are a walking, talking reminder of\r\nhow... how it happened, how I was used and tossed out like the morning trash. I\r\nlost my innocence, I lost my mother, I lost my life.\r\nBut see. You got to be the normal kid, Ava. You got to keep your vulnerability\r\nand your innocence. I get to live with the shame and the guilt. ",
        "Ava: You expect me to be miserable? ",
        "Olivia: Yeah. That's the least you can do\r\nfor me. ",
        "Ava: You just need to let it go. ",
        "Olivia: No, you need to let it go. I've\r\ntried, okay? I have tried to let got of this nightmare, but it just keeps coming\r\nback, and this time, it's in the version of you. ",
        "Ava: I have a right to learn about my past. ",
        "Olivia: You can screw your right. If you had\r\nhalf a brain, Ava, you would just let all of this go. Just let this whole\r\nrotten, miserable mess go. But whether you do or not, there is no way in hell\r\nthat I'm going to help you find that bastard. ",
        "",
        "Buzz: Okay, I admit, it's going to take some\r\ntime for Olivia and Ava to get chummy. All right, maybe a long time. ",
        "Coop: Well, you checked the weather forecast\r\nfor hell? Maybe there's a frost... ",
        "Buzz: Oh, come on. You know it\u2019s... Olivia\u2019s\r\nnot the first parent to muck up things with her kid. Look at me, you know? I\r\nmade every wrong decision, every bad move you can possibly make as a parent.\r\nBut you and Frank and Harley finally got around to forgiving me. ",
        "Coop: Dad, you're missing... look, you\r\ndidn't intentionally set out to try and hurt us, all right? Olivia, on the\r\nother hand, has made it her life goal to destroy Ava, to try and kill her. ",
        "Buzz: But she didn't know Ava was her\r\ndaughter. ",
        "Coop: You know what? Stop. Just stop all of\r\nthis. Tell me this. Has she ever once admitted she was wrong? Huh? I mean, Dad,\r\nhave you ever thought what might happen to you if you cross Olivia? No. ",
        "Buzz: I'm willing to take the risk. ",
        "Coop: Hey. Hi, guys how are you? Do you want\r\na table? ",
        "R.J.: Just ice cream. ",
        "Coop: Ice cream. Okay. You know what? Well,\r\nbad news. I'm off the shift clock myself, but if you don't mind scooping it\r\nyourself... yeah? Sound good? ",
        "R.J.: Yeah, sure. ",
        "Coop: Come on, let's go. ",
        "Tammy: Thanks. ",
        "Coop: Sure. ",
        "Tammy: Are you sure you want to fly eight\r\nhours with R.J. on a major sugar high? ",
        "Cassie: Well, now that you mention it, I\r\ncould use some backup. Why don't you throw some things in a bag and come with\r\nus? ",
        "Tammy: To Paris? ",
        "Cassie: Yeah. We'll make it a real family\r\ntrip. ",
        "Tammy: Yeah, that's just what you and Josh\r\nneed. Me moping around after you. ",
        "Cassie: Oh, come on. I think it would do you\r\nsome good to have some time away. Besides, you can help me,\r\nhelp us break the news to Marah. ",

        "Billy: Josh, just let them do their job. ",
        "Josh: Which is,\r\nwhat exactly, in Reva\u2019s case? What is their job, Billy? What... why is she\r\nhere? ",
        "Billy: Let's go get a cup of coffee and I'll\r\ntell you. ",
        "Josh: No, I don't want to go get a cup of\r\ncoffee, all right? Why is it that nobody in this place\r\ncan tell me what the hell is going on with Reva? ",
        "Billy: Well, Reva\u2019s... ",
        "Josh: Fine? Are you going to tell me she's\r\nfine again? Billy? What are you doing? What are you doing? Just talk to me,\r\nokay? It's me, it's Josh. Now obviously you know something. You called me and\r\nyou told me get here as quickly as possible. ",
        "Billy: Yeah, well, Reva\u2019s very sick. Reva\u2019s...\r\n",
        "Josh: I get that. I understand that. This is\r\nwhat the third time, at least they know of, that's she's collapsed and ended up\r\nin a hospital. She looks pale, she looks weak she\u2019s... the breathing... what is\r\ngoing on with her, Billy? ",
        "Billy: She's dying. Reva's dying. ",
        "Josh: What are you talking about? Reva's not\r\ndying. She threw a big party tonight. I mean, one of\r\nher classic Reva blowouts, with the red dress and the drink in her hand, having\r\na great time, fighting with people. ",
        "Billy: It's vintage Reva. ",
        "Josh: What's wrong with her? What does\r\nshe... what does she have? ",
        "Billy: Breast cancer. Josh, they've tried\r\neverything. ",
        "Josh: How long has she known? ",
        "Billy: Well, I think she was diagnosed just\r\nafter she came back from visiting Marah. ",
        "Josh: Wow. That was months and months ago.\r\nShe didn't say anything. ",
        "Billy: Well, no, she didn't tell anybody\r\nfirst. Actually, I think that she hadn't had a mammogram in a long time and\r\nthen-- you know Reva-- when she did have one, and they found the lump and it\r\nwas malignant, she figured that she'd just let the doctors take care of it and\r\nthen everything would be taken care of, so she was mum about it. ",
        "Josh: The doctors didn't take of it? ",
        "Billy: No, no, actually. No, it spread and\r\nthey tried chemo and they tried radiation, they tried surgery. They even sent\r\nher up to Minnesota for a new procedure, a stem cell replacement, but... ",
        "Josh: You went with her? ",
        "Billy: Yeah, I did. ",
        "Josh: So you... you've known about this from\r\nthe beginning? ",
        "Billy: No, no, no. Actually, Jonathan found\r\nout by accident and he... he only told me because he thought I could help. ",
        "Josh: So Jonathan told you, but no one... no\r\none told me? ",
        "Billy: It was her call, Josh. ",
        "Josh: Really? How did that work? ",
        "Billy: Well, you know, it all happened just\r\nabout the time that you were getting the project together for H.B.'s hospital. ",
        "Josh: So what? ",
        "Billy: So she didn't want you spending\r\nenergy on something negative. She wanted you doing this thing that was\r\nimportant and she was going to take care of this and when she got better she'd\r\ncome back and she'd take up her life as she wanted it. The life that she wanted\r\nwas the life with you, Josh. She wanted to be with you the whole time. ",
        "Josh: But she was never going to tell me\r\nabout this? About cancer? ",
        "Billy: She didn't want to burden you. ",
        "Josh: You know what it sounds like to me? It\r\nsounds like she didn't think that I could handle the fact that she was sick,\r\nbut that you could. ",
        "Billy: No, that's not it at all. ",
        "Josh: How many other people knew? ",
        "Billy: Oh, Josh... ",
        "Josh: How many people knew, Billy? ",
        "Billy: Jonathan, me, and the doctor, and\r\npeople at the hospital. ",
        "Josh: That's a lot of people. ",
        "Billy: And every one of us-- every one of\r\nus-- was concerned that she wasn't handling this right. ",
        "Josh: Yeah, but nobody did anything about\r\nit, did they? Nobody just, you know, thought for a second that maybe the\r\nhusband should know that his wife is fighting for her life, that maybe he could\r\nhelp in some way? ",
        "Billy: By that time, things were just moving\r\ntoo fast. ",
        "Josh: Meaning what? ",
        "Billy: When she realized that she wasn't\r\ngetting better... I mean, she was getting worse and then she was just going to\r\nget worse, well, she was kind of locked in then. ",
        "Josh: I see, so it was a fully developed lie\r\nby that time. ",
        "Billy: Josh, she was trying to put you\r\nfirst. ",
        "Josh: Yeah. Look where I ended up. Funny. Excuse me. ",
        "Billy: No, no, wait. Josh, don't go in\r\nthere. ",

        "Olivia: You're lucky you were spared. ",
        "Ava: Amen. Amen to Connie, who raised me, my\r\nmother, who taught me to be strong and confident. Who taught me to take care of\r\nmyself. ",
