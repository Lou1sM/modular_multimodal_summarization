        "Josh: Well, she's good.",
        "Billy: Yeah. She used to say, you know, every day that Josh and the kids didn't know was another day that Josh and the kids didn't know.",
        "Josh: Every day.",

        "Josh: Reva, when she puts her mind to something, there is no stopping her. I know that better than anyone.",
        "Billy: Josh, I want to tell you some things. I want to tell them to you because I'm not sure that Reva is going to be able to. First off, brother, she never stopped loving you. She had your picture by the bed. When she got disoriented, it was your name she called out. Even when she found out about you and Cassie, I mean she was mad, but she still loved you and still loved Cassie, too.",
        "Josh (crying): The divorce papers...",
        "Billy: That was just for you. I'm not going to kid you, I fell hard for her. I wanted to marry her; I wanted to make the best of the time we had. She was all for it, but when it came down to it, she couldn't do it. She told me that she wanted to love you forever and that in her heart, she'd always be your wife.",

        "Nicholas Art, \"Inside The Light.\" Film is a lot more strict. When you're about to tape, it takes about 20 times. And on TV shows, it takes about two. I went to Dubai-- that is right below Iraq-- and Switzerland-- that's in Geneva. And, when I was working on the \"Nanny Diaries,\" I met Tobey Maguire, who plays Spider-Man. See Zach and me, Harley, Wednesday, November 1, \"Inside The Light.\"",

        "Jonathan: She came back to pick you up?",
        "Billy: Yeah, yeah. And then she passed out.",

        "Jonathan: A lot of good it did, huh?",
        "Billy: Hey, don't talk like that. Your mom really appreciated that.",
        "Jonathan: Whatever. It wasn't supposed to be like this, with you two here.",
        "Josh: I understand why you were so hard on me and Cassie.",
        "Jonathan: So what now, are they helping her?",
        "Billy: No, you can't do anything. They're just giving her stuff for the pain, that's all.",
        "Cassie: I'm really glad you were there with her. It must have been really hard for you not to say anything to us.",
        "Jonathan: Can I talk to her?",
        "Josh: Like I said, she's sleeping.",
        "Jonathan: All right, I'm going to go for a walk. Just call me if she wakes up before I get back, okay?",
        "Josh: Can we just talk for a minute?",
        "Cassie: Um, Marah sent me an email the other day and told me about her new roommate, so I'm thinking that if I try to contact her...",
        "Josh: Cassie, just... I appreciate that you did that, but I think that I'm the one that has to tell my kids about this.",

        "Mallet: Just so you know, I came in through the back so the blogger wouldn't see me in case he's still staking out the house.",
        "Dinah: You came in through the back because you didn't want anybody seeing your stupid loincloth.",
        "Mallet: Oh, this loincloth? You mean the one you just ruined.",
        "Dinah: You know, you got it on the top part. You got a little on your chest. Calm down. Just take it off and I'll get it out.",
        "Mallet: No, I can't get it off.",
        "Dinah: Because you're doing it wrong.",
        "Mallet: I'll get it. Just stop it. Stop it. Marina got me the wrong size. It's ruined.",
        "Dinah: Marina got you this? I see. Well, then in that case, maybe we should cut off the loincloth.",

        "Mallet: It's okay, come back! It's not real! She's not coming back.",

        "Tammy: Oh.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, she found out by accident-- the same way that I did-- so I had to tell her.",
        "Tammy: So she's here at the hospital with you?",
        "Jonathan: No.",
        "Tammy: Do you want me to call her for you?",

        "Mallet: You know, I feel kind of guilty leaving that traumatized little fairy princess lost on the streets, roaming around.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, well, I think it was my fault. I'm the one who grabbed the knife.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, well, she'll find some chocolate bars and some candy corn and she'll be fine.",
        "Dinah: I can't stand candy corn.",
        "Mallet: You don't like candy corn? How can you not like candy corn? It's the best part of Halloween.",
        "Dinah: Well, I'm all about the chocolate. You know that. Would you like to come in for a drink?",
        "Mallet: I... I don't really want to hang out in Jeffrey's room.",
        "Dinah: Well, he's not going to be back for several hours. He had a meeting at the deer club.",
        "Mallet: That's funny. That's as funny as my Tarzan outfit. Don't you mean the Elks' club?",
        "Dinah: I don't know. I don't hunt. The Elks' club, I guess. I don't know. Jeffrey... hi.",
        "Jeffrey: Hi. You thought I had a speech at the Elks' club, didn't you? Well, it was cancelled. Some pipe burst over there, and they gave me the endorsement anyway. So come in and we'll celebrate.",
        "Mallet: No, actually I was just dropping her off. That's fine. Good night.",
        "Dinah: Wait, Mallet. Mallet?",

        "Tammy: You didn't lose me. Things just changed.",
        "Jonathan: You make it sound like it just happened. I made a mistake. I made a baby, that's what happened.",
        "Tammy: And now you love that baby.",
        "Jonathan: Well, she's going to be all I have left. I'm not here because I'm still hoping. I'm here because somebody up there is taking away my mom and is going to make me a dad, and I don't want anything to do with any of it. I'm pissed off and I want everything to go back to the way it was.",
        "Tammy: When you came to town hating Reva, wanting to hurt her, do you remember who you were then? Because I remember that.",
        "Jonathan: Stop it.",
        "Tammy: You're the one she trusted with this. When she pushed the rest of us away, she pulled you in closer. You grew up thinking that she didn't want you, but when it counted, when she could have had anybody, she wanted you.",
        "Jonathan: I already told you I found out about the cancer by accident.",
        "Tammy: But maybe that was your miracle, Jonathan. Maybe the two of you were supposed to go through this together so that you would realize how much you mean to her, and how much you have to give. Please don't give up. You have to still believe.",
        "Jonathan: I don't know how to believe in anything without you.",

        "Josh: I'll take it.",
        "Cassie: I'll take it. You should have this. Take it. Staring at the stars that you painted on the ceiling I get so lonely while you sleep why's it always me seeing question marks in places where the answers used to be it must be getting late the silent lullabies are keeping me awake no more sad songs tonight come on love, bring me back to life make it all stand still stand still no more sad songs tonight from your rooftop, the night sky looks the same and we thought it would never change but like you and me, our love is everything around us, even the stars drift away no more sad songs tonight could our love bring me back to life make it all stand still, stand still no more sad songs tonight make it all stand still no more sad songs tonight",
