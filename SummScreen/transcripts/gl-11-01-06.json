        "Zach: Mommy, when is my costume going to be done?",
        "Harley: It's getting there.",
        "Zach: Doesn't look too good, Mommy.",
        "Harley: Thanks. Could you get up, please, and help me?",
        "Coop: Harley, I'm re....",
        "Harley: Please, could you go find the Captain America box and see if the mask needs to be adjusted, please? I know, don't say it, you need to go to your Halloween party, I know, but I have to fix your costume, sweetie. And I know I have to fix yours, believe me. Captain America and Sheriff Zach will be out battling the forces of evil...",
        "Gus: Honey. Do you know anything about a power outage or something because we're having a flickering problem. Of course, the doorbell's got to short on the one night it's going to get the most use.",
        "Harley: I don't know how I ever thought I could pull this off. This thing is not going to be ready for a walk down the road, let alone fighting crime.",
        "Buzz: Happy Halloween!",
        "Coop: Pop.",
        "Buzz: Coop.",
        "Harley: Okay, could you two just act normal, please? I'm not letting these two women come between you. That's ridiculous.",
        "Coop: Will you take it easy? Can't save the world.",
        "Harley: I can try.",
        "Coop: But we got a lot going on, honey. We're having a baby.",
        "Harley: I know. I just hate anything with electricity right now. Does anybody else think this needle is ridiculously small? Come on. I don't need those. All right. I'll take them. Do you think that Iron Man and Captain America need reading glasses?",
        "Marina: Hey.",
        "Mallet: Hey. Your doorbell isn't working.",
        "Harley: We are calling an electrician tomorrow. And I think it might be too little too late.",
        "Mallet: We just saw a bunch of kids walk away treatless because nobody answered the door. It's Halloween.",
        "Harley: Do you have any good news to tell us?",
        "Marina: Another message from the Springfield Burns blogger, but with everyone wearing a mask tonight, we can't tell who's who.",
        "Harley: Perfect. This is perfect. You know, I am so over secrets. I hate the people who keep them and I hate the people who tell them, all of it.",
        "Gus: Babe, I'm going to go check on the lights, okay?",
        "Harley: No, no, because you're the one who wired this house in the first place. I will go. I need some air and my little hurt sewing finger needs air, too. I can't sew. Can't fix Dad and Coop. Can't find the blogger. Can't get pregnant. Superpowers, ha.",
        "Green goblin punk: We warned you, lady. Trick-or-treat. Too late.",
        "Harley: I have candy, look out! Oh you evil doers. You're too old to trick-or- treat. And you are just taunting me. See if I can do... (gasps)",

        "Coop: What is going on with the electricity tonight?",
        "Rick: Gus, what happened? What happened to her?",
        "Gus: There was Halloween lights and she was wet. She touched them and she got electrocuted. She hasn't opened her eyes since...",
        "Rick: Give me the crash cart, I'm gonna check her pulse. Her body is still holding a charge.",
        "Nurse: Is that possible?",
        "Rick: I don't know, I've never seen anything like this, I mean she's got no breathe, no pulse, nothing. Paddles.",
        "Coop: Will she be okay?",
        "Rick: She's doing fine. Let's amp it to 300. Clear the table. Don't worry, Gus. I'm in charge.",
        "Gus: What was that?",
        "Harley: What? What?",
        "Gus: Harley?",
        "Harley: What's everybody looking at? Oh my gosh. Rick, are you okay? My watch stopped. We have to get back to the boys.",

        "Gus: Are you sure you're okay?",
        "Harley: Yeah. Actually, I feel surprisingly good. I'm sorry I worried you.",
        "Gus: It's all right. I guess you weren't unconscious that long.",
        "Harley: But you know, maybe it was the nap I needed, because I feel energized. Can I drive?",
        "Gus: Baby, I...",
        "Harley: Come on, let me drive. I like it.",

        "Gus: Gotta get that fixed.",
        "Harley: I cannot believe how much time I've wasted tonight.",
        "Gus: Why don't you take your coat off? Let's take a little something for yourself.",
        "Harley: I don't have time to just lie around. I've got to whip up some dinner for the boys. They can't eat candy alone.",
        "Gus: I beg to differ with you. I'll handle it, though.",
        "Harley: No, you've had a stressful night. I'm going to make something for you, too. What's going on?",
        "Gus: Everything okay babe?",
        "Harley: Perfectly normal. Okay, that's weird. But very cool. Hi, there.",
        "Frank: That was fast. How did you know I was here?",
        "Harley: You rang the doorbell.",
        "Frank: No, I didn't. I wanted to, but you were like here in two seconds, so.",
        "Harley: Oh, I thought you did.",
        "Frank: Nice hair. You might want to back off the eye drops, too. I heard you got shocked. Are you okay?",
        "Harley: Yeah, that was just some bad information. Did you come here to check on your little sister?",
        "Frank: Yes, I did. Yes, I did. In case you haven't noticed, the power's been kind of wacky here a little bit.",
        "Harley: Yeah, just a little.",
        "Gus: Frank, did you find out what's causing the power surges?",
        "Frank: No, not yet. Actually, there are power outages all over the county. And unfortunately, including the prison.",
        "Harley: Uh-oh.",
        "Frank: Dash and Bash Carnage have escaped.",
        "Gus: The Carnage twins? Didn't you put them away for a string of violent assaults a couple of years ago?",
        "Harley: Oh yeah. And at their trial, they vowed revenge.",
        "Frank: Well, don't worry, they won't get far.",
        "Gus: Frank, I want to help find them. Come on.",
        "Harley: Me, too.",
        "Gus: No, no way.",
        "Frank: Yeah, that's actually a double no way.",
        "Harley: I'm going, and you can't stop me. You both know that, right?",
        "Gus: Why do I feel like I've had this conversation a thousand times?",
        "Harley: You guys go outside. I'll meet you there in just a second. There's one little thing I want to take care of.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Can we just grab a little coffee and go right back out again, okay?",
        "Dispatcher: Unit 12. Unit 12. Detective Aitoro, please acknowledge.",
        "Gus: Right, well, I'll check that out. Maybe they found the Carnage twins.",
        "Harley: Okay. We'll, I'll take care of the coffee. Shouldn't take long. Man, I could get used to this.",
        "Dash: Is that what I think it is, bro?",
        "Harley: Hello, Dash. Bash.",
        "Dash: Detective Cooper. As we live and breathe. Long time no see, baby. You're just the chick we were looking for.",
        "Dash: Five years, Cooper. Five years we went away.",
        "Bash: This is going to be so sweet.",
        "Harley: Okay, guys. I guess you got me. Nothing left to do but surrender. But first, don't you think this room needs a little energy? Hey, guys, prison has slowed you down. Light on my feet, aren't I? Is this an electric moment? Blinded by the light. Been good seeing you boys. You look like you could use some enlightenment. (Phone dialing)",
        "Gus: Harley.",
        "Harley: You'll be happy to know I have the Carnage twins in custody.",
        "Gus: They're there with you right now?",

        "Gus: Are you okay? I mean...",
        "Harley: Yes, there's just something I have to take care of. Just make sure the Carnage twins are put safely back in their pens. Let's give this baby a test run. Springfield, my town, my people. So much trouble, so many secrets.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Hey. I came here to light a candle for Reva. Are you...",
        "Harley: I'm okay.",
        "Buzz: So much misery. So many people lost. Suffering.",
        "Harley: Daddy, do you think it's possible to make a difference in peoples' lives?",
        "Buzz: Sure it is. How many people-- everywhere just like Springfield are looking for something?",
        "Harley: What? What are they looking for?",
        "Buzz: Something bigger. They're just wandering in the dark and searching for a light. Something to guide the way. But that's just...",
        "Harley: For too long, Springfield had suffered in the dark, looking for a savior, searching for hope and guidance. I can be that hope. I am that hero. I am the Guiding Light.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Didn't anyone ever teach you to respect your elders?",
        "Mugger: What are you supposed to be?",
        "Harley: Don't look so shocked.",

        "Pre-teen: Who are you?",
        "Harley: If anyone asks, tell them you were guided by the light. Hi.",
        "Gus: Hi. Did you just get home?",
        "Harley: Yeah, I wanted to make sure the Carnage twins were safely put away. Where are my boys?",
        "Gus: Sent them to school.",
        "Harley: Really? I didn't realize it was that late.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: I should have dressed for work.",
        "Gus: Can't microwave bread. Honey.",
        "Harley: I'll be right back down.",
        "Gus: Frank said all the case files were sent over here so we can begin our cross- referencing. Make sure a little elephant didn't fly over the moon on a big lump of cheese.",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Gus: You're not the listening to me.",
        "Harley: I am listening. You said Frank, cross referencing, yadda yadda.",
        "Gus: We're detecting. It's what we're supposed to do. It's in the job title. Detective?",
        "Harley: Oh, I know it's your job. It's how you-- regular detectives solve crimes.",
        "Gus: Regular detectives?",
        "Harley: I didn't mean that. I'm just-- I'm tired, hon. It was a long night, okay? (Telephone ringing)",
        "Mallet: Oh, man. The phone keeps ringing. Frank's put me in charge of this wacko.",
        "Gus: Fans get a hold of your cell phone number? (Laughs)",
        "Mallet: No, he's put me in charge of the wacko. My phone rings all the time.",
        "Gus: Your girlfriend?",
        "Mallet: The wacko, the one running around with a cape and a shiny sports bra?",
        "Harley: Who are you talking about?",
        "Mallet: You guys haven't heard about this, this freaky- deaky running around Springfield in a Halloween costume? Apparently she's hitting the streets fighting crime.",
        "Marina: Like a real super hero?",
        "Mallet: No, I think more like a vigilante. Okay, get this, the eyewitnesses say that she calls herself the Guiding Light, the Guiding Light. Yes, she returns around, she zaps people with a tazer.",
        "Gus: What's a guiding light?",
        "Harley: Maybe she is just trying to help people. Maybe she's trying to catch the bad guys. Did you think of that?",
        "Mallet: Isn't that our job?",
        "Harley: Yes, but maybe we're not doing... (Voices) Oh, oh!",
        "Marina: No. I'm with Aunt Harley.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Man: Food was really excellent tonight, don't you think?",
        "Woman: I don't know. My chicken was a little dry.",
        "Man: Why don't I call for...",
        "Woman: Oh!",
        "Harley: Don't worry, folks. I'm a whiz with electronics.",

        "Harley: Hello, everyone. Enjoying your meal? Need anything heated up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Telephone ringing)",
        "Mallet: Mallet. No, we don't have crispy duck tonight. No, we don't do deliveries. Okay. We'll talk to you tomorrow. Wrong number.",
        "Marina: No kidding.",
        "Mallet: Yeah. So when is there going to be some crime?",
        "Marina: You know why it's been so slow.",
        "Mallet: I don't want to talk about it.",
        "Marina: The Guiding Light. She single handedly cleaning up the streets.",
        "Mallet: Please, I don't want to talk about it.",
        "Marina: You're just jealous.",
        "Mallet: I'm jealous? I'm jealous of Light Bulb Betty?",
        "Marina: No. The Guiding Light. What if this whole thing is for real?",
        "Mallet: You're right, what if it's for real? Geez, I don't know. Maybe I should call my best friend Spider Man and see what he has to say about it. I have him on speed dial right above the Incredible Hulk and the Easter Bunny. (Phone rings) Let me guess, you're interested in the wonton soup? What? When? Okay. Okay.",
        "Marina: What?",
        "Mallet: There was a break-in down on Main Street. It triggered the alarm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Alarm sounding)",
        "Marina: Okay, now, that's weird.",
        "Mallet: That's weird. \"Happy Birthday, Detective Mallet? I got this fellow helping himself to the contents of the jewelry store. Have fun. Love... Love, The Guiding Light.\"",
        "Perp: Lock me up, put me away. I just don't want her to catch me again. Are my ears smoking?",
        "Mallet: Okay, that's enough. Just hush, okay?",
        "Marina: Convinced yet?",
        "Mallet: This lightbulb lady, she's, she's a showoff.",
        "Harley: Problem, Detective?",
        "Mallet: Look who it is. It's our friend. Boy, I should have worn my rubber soled boots today.",
        "Harley: Not a fan of my work?",
        "Marina: Ah, no, no. Don't mind him. He's a guy, you know. He just feels like you're stealing his thunder. Or lightning.",
        "Harley: We're all on the same team, Detective.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, yeah, we are. One of the-- well, then, how come my uniform doesn't show off my stomach?",
        "Harley: Maybe my stomach's just better than your stomach.",
        "Marina: Oh, she's got you there.",
        "Harley: I like your partner.",
        "Marina: I like your boots.",
        "Harley: Thanks.",
        "Marina: Can I shake your hand?",
        "Harley: Wouldn't advise it.",
        "Marina: Right. So what are you doing here?",
        "Harley: Just checking in. Letting you know I'll be using my super powers to help fight evil wherever it may lurk.",
        "Mallet: I think that's great. I think that's really heroic. Why don't we go back in the interrogation room and you can tell us all about it?",
        "Harley: Not today.",
        "Marina: You so deserve to get zapped!",

        "(Champaign corks pops)",
        "Gus: It's been a while since we've had a night like this.",
        "Harley: I know. I'm sorry about that.",
        "Gus: Here you go. So I guess we should talk about some stuff. You know, like if you want to try to get pregnant, when...",
        "Harley: Well, you know that I want to. (Voices) Help, help!",
        "Gus: Is something wrong?",
        "Harley: I just remembered, I need to buy some milk.",

        "Coop: Yeah, it is, actually.",
        "Harley: What are you looking at? More super hero stuff, huh?",
        "Coop: Please, I can't get enough of that stuff. Are you kidding?",
        "Harley: I wonder if the Fantastic Four ever get tired of putting away the bad guys, you know? I know another day, another dastardly deed foiled.",
        "Coop: I don't think so. There's never enough time to be bored, like you said, there's always another super villain trying to take over the world.",
        "Harley: Another super villain, huh?",
        "Coop: Can't have a good character or hero without a super villain or arch enemy now, can we?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Whoever this Springfield Burns blogger is that knows everything. It's like he's in our heads.",
        "Mallet: Well, he certainly knows how to avoid being caught.",

        "Harley: Blogger. He's no Dr. Doom, but it's not bad.",
        "Dispatcher: Unit 12, unit 12. Possible lead on \"Springfield Burns.\"",
        "Harley: Not very challenging. Come out of the darkness. Show yourself.",
        "Gus: Wow. Look at you. It's the Guiding Light. How are you, babe?",
        "Harley: You should stay back. I can't always control this.",
        "Gus: That's a chance I'm willing to take.",
        "Harley: I'm serious, Gus. You should stay back.",
        "Gus: Whoa. You really are a super hero. What, you didn't want to tell me?",
        "Harley: Well, you know how it is with us super heroes. If they find out your identity, they'll get to you through the people that you love.",
        "Gus: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Harley: Did you see my boots? See how fast I am. I can zip along power lines.",
        "Gus: I understand super hero. But you're also my wife and a mom.",
        "Harley: I love you. I love you and the kids more than ever, but this could be the most important thing I'll ever do. I could save this town.",
        "Gus: What about your life? And your family?",
        "Harley: Well, I admit I am afraid to touch the children. I won't give them a bath. I won't take them to their swim lesson, that's for sure.",
        "Gus: What if we see, like, an expert, you know? And figure out what happened to you and then maybe you can find a way to control it?",
        "Harley: Know many super scientists, do you?",
        "Gus: Not exactly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Rick, did you think you could understand any of this?",
        "Rick: Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely. I've been very interested about reading about the Guiding Light ever since your accident zapped me, electrocuted and took all the hair off my back, so I started studying super human phenomena.",
        "Gus: And?",
        "Rick: And... all of us are surrounded by some sort of electromagnetic field. My best guess is when Harley was electrocuted, excited that field giving her the ability to super charge machinery, move at super human speed.",
        "Harley: And zap bad guys, don't forget that, it's my favorite part.",
        "Rick: And zap good guys like me.",
        "Gus: Is there a cure?",
        "Harley: A cure? Guiding light has single handedly wiped out crime in Springfield. She saved lives. She's hot on the trail of the blogger. She can't go away now.",
        "Rick: I want you to try something. Stick your pinky in this little glass of water.",
        "Harley: Why?",
        "Rick: Just try it. Hmm.",
        "Harley: Now what?",
        "Rick: Okay. Let's test the connectivity of the appendage.",
        "Harley: Ow. Okay.",
        "Rick: Give it a shot. Stick your finger right in there.",
        "Harley: Just step back. Hey, hey.",
        "Gus: It's gone?",
        "Rick: Bingo. Water. When you shorted yourself out, all of your power will be gone. My diagnosis is a full body submersion and everything will be absolutely perfect again.",
        "Harley: You mean normal?",
        "Gus: Honey. What do you do say we go home, get you a nice bath, and we'll spend the night together?",
        "Harley: That sounds really good, but... is that a live feed? Someone is recording something down at the docks right now. I can feel it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: I can't ever leave you. I can keep this town safe and still have my family. I'm a super hero, aren't I? I know that freak is here. \"Springfield Burns\" blogger, your reign of terror is over. The Guiding Light is here. Electricity and water. My powers. I can't. I can't do it. I can't risk it. Gus! Gus, what are you doing?",
        "Gus: You're not the only one who can be heroic.",
        "Harley: Now take off your mask and prepare to have your treachery revealed.",
        "Gus: Ashlee?",
        "Harley: You're the blogger?",
        "Ashlee: No, I'm not, I swear.",
        "Gus: Explain.",
        "Ashlee: Well, I really like looking at that site, you know? And I wrote these e-mails, you know, just like a fan.",
        "Gus: Fabulous.",
        "Ashlee: Well, I got this e-mail back saying, would I like to be a freelance reporter.",
        "Harley: A reporter?",
        "Ashlee: Yeah, well, we'll dirt-getter, whatever. I didn't do anything illegal, I just listened to people's conversations at Co-2.",
        "Gus: Did you ever meet the blogger?",
        "Ashlee: No, no, I swear. No, it was just the e-mails. (Sirens)",
        "Gus: Get out of here. I'll take care of this.",
        "Harley: Are you sure?",
        "Gus: Yes. Go, I'll make sure she's questioned properly.",
        "Ashlee: Wow, she's real cool.",
        "Gus: Yes, she is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: You don't have to be a super hero, okay? You just have to be my partner in every single way.",
        "Harley: We are a team, huh?",
        "Gus: We're a team. But I'm not awe sidekick, do you understand? I mean, we are equal, completely right down the line, that's just the way it's got to be. Hey.",
        "Harley: One small thing. I like being a super hero. I get things done. And I haven't even started working on my personal stuff yet. Imagine what I could do, I could-- my father, my little brother, I could lock them in a room somewhere. They'd have to sort out their problems. I could zap some great woman for Frank. He goes in, he had to rescue her, they fall in love...",
        "Gus: Hey, hey, that's not the way super heroes work. You can't solve other peoples' problems, you can't make people happier.",
        "Harley: I could try. You know how I get when I can't control everything.",
        "Gus: Super powers aren't going to help us get pregnant again. We're going to.",
        "Harley: How do you know?",
        "Gus: Because we're a super couple. We got our own super powers.",
        "Harley: One last thing I can do with my powers, I can make the water from here, dive right in, that will be that.",
        "Gus: Wait. I just want to try one thing before you go. (Sparks) That was pretty good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Just me, regular old Harley.",
        "Gus: There's nothing regular about you, kid.",
        "Harley: Did any of that really happen? Did I just dream all of that after I got electrocuted?",
        "Gus: I don't know. Does it really matter?",
        "Harley: I should probably get rid of this?",
        "Gus: I was thinking actually maybe we could keep it in case we want to put it on. You want to put it on?",
        "Harley: (Laughs) Oh, no, no, no. Let me. (Heroic music playing)"
