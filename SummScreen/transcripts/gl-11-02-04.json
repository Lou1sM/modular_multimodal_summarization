        "Josh: How much people are we setting this up table for?",
        "Reva: Three.",
        "Josh: Three, let's see, what happened to Sandy. One down.",
        "Reva: Joshua.",
        "Josh: I will grill the steaks and I will serve the drinks and I will behave, all right, as long as Jonathan treats you right.",
        "Reva: I know this is difficult for you, but he is my son.",
        "Josh: He's got a long way to go before he deserves the right to be called that.",
        "Reva: Well, I deserve the right to be his mother. A mother to him or any of my children.",
        "Josh: Reva, stop. Okay, don't do that. There is not a mother on the planet that loves her kids more than you do. Speaking of which, I talked to Marah today. She just wanted to call and let us know that she and Shayne have, you know, filed and sent there absentee ballots like the responsible voters they are.",
        "Reva: You know, those two are amazing.",
        "Josh: We did okay.",
        "Reva: Well, you did. I mean, you made them the incredibly responsible people that they are. Did you tell Marah about ...",
        "Josh: No, not yet. We're going to have to soon though. Right now I just want to concentrate on getting you through this night, okay.",
        "Reva: Your nose is cold. (Laughs)",
        "Jonathan: Look's like three's a crowd.",
        "Reva: Hey. I'm glad you came back.",
        "Jonathan: Let's get this over with.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Jeffrey? Jeffrey, I told you ... Stop yelling at me. I told you that Tammy's on her way to Chicago. I don't know. You know what? Shouldn't you be asking these questions to Cassie? She is the girl's mother. Look, you know what? If you want to score points with Cassie, I think you should put together a search team so you can track down the troubled teen. Okay. All right, fine. You know what? Have fun finding Tammy. This couldn't have turned out better if I wrote it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Hey, Edmund. Hi. I got to go.",
        "Edmund: Where are you going?",
        "Cassie: Tammy called.",
        "Edmund: Good. Where is she?",
        "Cassie: Not good. She called to say good-bye and I've got to go find her, okay.",
        "Edmund: Where is she? Do you know where she is?",
        "Cassie: Chicago. A woman called said she was looking for a job. So ...",
        "Edmund: Where?",
        "Cassie: A place where I used to work.",
        "Edmund: What?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. So I really got to go find her, okay.",
        "Edmund: Okay, fine. We'll take my car. Let's go.",
        "Cassie: You can't come. You're the reason Tammy ran away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley/Ruth: Now you could have trusted me, sir. Instead you tried to kill me. Now excuse me for saying so, but you have been a very, very bad boss, and you are going to have to pay for that.",
        "Phillip: (Laughs nervously) Ruth, do you want to continue this conversation someplace else?",
        "Harley/Ruth: Yes, sir. How about in there?",
        "Phillip: That'll be fine. Let's do that. I think she stills upset from whatever happened.",
        "Gus: Right.",
        "Phillip: I'll tell you what, I'll call you if I need you.",
        "Harley/Ruth: No, no, no. I would like Mr. Aitoro to stay. I have nothing to hide. How about you?",
        "Phillip: Not a thing.",
        "Gus: Okay.",
        "Harley/Ruth: I'll tell you when I saw that car coming right for me I thought for certain I was a goner. Nothing like a near death experience to put things in perspective is there, sir?",
        "Phillip: Well, you're going to have to be more careful, Ruth.",
        "Ruth: Funny, I was going to say the same thing to you.",
        "Gus: You know, Miss Karloff, maybe you're a little too upset. And right now you need to ... I'll drive you home. You want to go home?",
        "Harley: No. No thank you. The negotiations are about to begin. And this time I'm in the driver's seat.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: So what are you cooking? Actually I'm a little afraid to afraid to ask. You don't seem like the cooking type.",
        "Josh: Don't work so hard at being a tough guy.",
        "Jonathan: Or what? You'll pummel me again?",
        "Josh: I'll bring out the rest of the food.",
        "Jonathan: And a drink.",
        "Reva: We have sodas and fresh apple cider.",
        "Jonathan: A real drink.",
        "Reva: That's not going to happen.",
        "Jonathan: Cider.",
        "Reva: That's the spirit.",
        "Jonathan: So what happens at these things? Do you have any ground rules or ... My loving adoptive family from hell wasn't big on family nights.",
        "Reva: Well, rule number one is that you try to relax and make yourself comfortable in my home.",
        "Jonathan: What if I have questions?",
        "Reva: Well, ask away. I'll try to answer them.",
        "Jonathan: Where do I start? Okay, here's one for you. Talk to me about how it feels to go through every man in one family--marrying them and then dumping them one by one. That's a neat trick.",
        "Reva: You've been doing your homework.",
        "Jonathan: You were a very busy woman. How did you ever find time to get knocked up by my old man, Prince Richard?",
        "Reva: I've loved a lot of men in my life, and your father was a wonderfully caring person.",
        "Jonathan: Just like his offspring.",
        "Reva: You know, you have a lot more in common with him than you know.",
        "Jonathan: Nah. I think I take after my Uncle Edmund.",
        "Reva: Well, that's not an all together terrible thing. You know, he's changed a lot. It's amazing what love could do.",
        "Jonathan: You should know.",
        "Reva: It sure beats hate.",
        "Jonathan: That's not why I'm here.",
        "Reva: Well, you could have fooled me.",
        "Jonathan: Good.",
        "Reva: So why don't you tell me why you are here?",
        "Jonathan: Free food. What else?",
        "Josh: Gee, what did I miss?",
        "Reva: Just a little pre-dinner chitchat.",
        "Jonathan: Mom was just showing me the ropes. So what next? Is the group hug before salad or after dessert?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You heard Tammy the other night. Look, it's rational, but she blames you for the way Jonathan turned out, and what happened to her because of it. I know she's not seeing straight. Please understand. I'm so sorry. I need you to ...",
        "Edmund: No, I do understand. I understand. And I ... I ... Tammy's right. And I still want to help. So when I drive you to Chicago to that place, the club and I'll wait. So it'll be fine.",
        "Cassie: No, no, you can't. Because see that place is a strip club. And you can't even say the name.",
        "Edmund: I'm sorry?",
        "Cassie: Look, I know that you are still horrified by that part of my life.",
        "Edmund: No, Cassie, I'm not.",
        "Cassie: This isn't about us right now, Edmund. It's about Tammy, and I really can't take the chance on her running.",
        "Edmund: All right, all right, but I still don't think you should do it alone.",
        "Cassie: I'm going to swing by Reva's. I know she'll be more than willing to help me. Okay, I promise I'll call you as soon as I know anything about Tammy.",
        "Edmund: All right. I love you.",
        "Cassie: Thank you. I love you, too. I'm sorry. Oh, Jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: I know where Tammy is.",
        "Cassie: Chicago. I know. I'm on my way.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Do you want me to go with you?",
        "Cassie: No. No, no. That's okay. Thanks. I'm going to swing by Reva's and pick her up.",
        "Jeffrey: Are you sure? I have some contacts, people that can help us.",
        "Cassie: No, thank you. I think I need to be as sensitive as possible with this. But thank you for everything you've done. Thanks.",
        "Dinah: Jeffrey, you are so predictable.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: Well, Ruth, I have no idea what any of this is about, but by all means go ahead. What is it that you want?",
        "Harley/Ruth: You're fortunate the company attorney is present. You're going to need him. Attempted murder is a serious crime. Wouldn't you say so, Mr. Aitoro?",
        "Phillip: Well, that's a bold charge.",
        "Harley/Ruth: Mr. Aitoro saw it happen.",
        "Gus: Well, actually I didn't see a driver, and I didn't catch a license plate number.",
        "Harley/Ruth: Let's begin with the car that I found half buried in the swamp in the back of your property. The car involved in the Sandy Foster hit and tun. That was your driver, wasn't it? That's what you said.",
        "Gus: Is that true?",
        "Phillip: What do you think?",
        "Harley/Ruth: I have pictures of the car ... Before you made it disappear. (Sucking her teeth) Mr. Spaulding, now, sir, I told you that you could trust me with what I knew, but that wasn't enough for you. You tried to shut me up for good.",
        "Phillip: You know, Ruth, I have to tell you, you need to be careful when you talk like this because you're going to get locked up in Ravenwood.",
        "Harley/Ruth: Are you saying that I'm crazy, sir?",
        "Gus: No, no. Come on, he's not saying anything like that at all. Look, just say exactly what it is that you want, Miss Karloff. What is it that would make this right for you? Maybe a small cash settlement? Hmm?",
        "Harley/Ruth: Your brother tries to kill me, and now you're trying to buy me off?",
        "Gus: No, no. Nothing like that. I'm just trying to reach an understanding here.",
        "Phillip: Well, wait a minute. Don't try to placate her. She can't prove any of this.",
        "Harley/Ruth: I can see the headlines now. \"Spaulding Ceo [sic] hired gun on help.\" Oh, that would get the tongues a wagging, won't it?",
        "Phillip: (Laughs)",
        "Harley/Ruth: It'll certainly amp up the pressure on the real hit and run driver. People could talk. Yes, perhaps even your daughter, Miss Lizzie. She certainly looked like she was ready to crack earlier.",
        "Phillip: I suggest you leave my daughter out of this.",
        "Gus: Easy, all right.",
        "Phillip: Do you understand me?",
        "Harley/Ruth: Mr. Spaulding, I am not afraid of you. The mayor already knows I was almost hit this evening.",
        "Gus: Yeah, Ross was down there. He showed up right after it happened.",
        "Phillip: Oh, good. I assume you're referring to my Uncle Ross, the mayor.",
        "Harley/Ruth: I don't care if he's your uncle. He's still a very ethical man. And when I tell him that I recognize the driver as one of your hired goons, you'll be doing jail time with your aunt.",
        "Gus: All right, Ruth, what is it that you want?",
        "Harley/Ruth: Yes, it's very simple. I want Spaulding Enterprises--lock, stock and barrel. (knock on the door)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Surprise.",
        "Edmund: What do you want?",
        "Dinah: Well, I actually feel terrible about Tammy. If I knew that she was running away, I would have tried to stop her.",
        "Edmund: You saw her?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, just for second. She was getting into her car outside of J. Farley's and ... I mean, she looked so upset, and I couldn't blame her after she found that she slept with her cousin.",
        "Edmund: When did you see her?",
        "Dinah: Just a few hours ago. I would have thought that Jeffrey would have said something when he came to pick up Cassie.",
        "Edmund: O'Neill never came here. Cassie went to pick Reva up on her way out of town.",
        "Dinah: I know. I saw her leaving when I drove up, but Jeffrey was with her. They left together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Jonathan and I were just talking about family relationships.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy and I, Mom and the Lewis men. (Laughs) looks like I'm not the only one who likes to keep it in the family, right, Mom? (Laughs)",
        "Josh: Bread?",
        "Jonathan: Thanks.",
        "Reva: Thank you, Joshua.",
        "Jonathan: Joshua. How formal.",
        "Josh: When are you going to leave town? It seems to me that your work here is done. So where are you going from here?",
        "Jonathan: Good questions, Joshua. I'm finding myself bored with small town life. So I was thinking about leaving the country.",
        "Reva: Where would you go?",
        "Jonathan: I was thinking ... I don't know, Eastern Europe. Or Paris. I hear there are some really hot, young designers ...",
        "Josh: You stay away from Marah and you stay away from Shayne.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, you hear that, Mom? Step dad is trying to keep me away from the other kids.",
        "Reva: No, it's just because Marah and Shayne have had a rough past year.",
        "Jonathan: Who hasn't?",
        "Reva: And Shayne is difficult to reach and Marah is in the process of actually moving. To London. I mean, we don't even have an address for her yet.",
        "Jonathan: So, I guess the mail I sent to her place along the Parc Montsouris won't get to her, then?",
        "Josh: I guess it won't. (Doorbell rings)",
        "Jonathan: I'll get it.",
        "Josh: Great. Now what?",
        "Reva: It can't get any worse.",
        "Jonathan: Aunt Cassie. What a surprise. Hey, Mom, set another place for dinner.",
        "Cassie: What the hell is he doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: You want Spaulding Enterprises. Is that all? Well, sure, Ruth, no problem.",
        "Harley/Ruth: Draw up the papers.",
        "Phillip: Yeah, Gus. Go ahead. Draw up the papers. (Laughs) is that ... Is that the way you thought this was going to work, Ruth? You thought you were just going to walk in here and you were going to make a couple of threats and I was going to cower and give you my company? Is that what you thought?",
        "Harley/Ruth: No. No, sir. Not exactly.",
        "Phillip: Oh, good. Good.",
        "Harley/Ruth: And please don't think of it as handing over the company. Think of it as giving me a well-earned big, fat promotion.",
        "Gus: Promotion. That ... Now, promotion, that sounds reasonable. We could do ...",
        "Harley/Ruth: To Ceo. Big cheese, queen of the world. Whatever you'd like to call it.",
        "Gus: All right, now. See, Ruth ...",
        "Harley/Ruth: I just want the power, sir.",
        "Gus: Going a little overboard, now, Ruth.",
        "Harley/Ruth: Well, then I guess that's something Mr. Spaulding and I will have in common. Sir, I'm holding your life in my hands, aren't I? If we could just work together, sir.",
        "Phillip: Ruth, listen to me. You're making a huge mistake, and it's one that you will not be able to take back.",
        "Harley/Ruth: You wouldn't believe the ideas I have for this company, sir. No, for the town of Springfield. This town will flourish under my watch.",
        "Phillip: Is this all ... Is this all just some sort of a big joke to you, Ruth?",
        "Harley/Ruth: I was almost road-kill tonight. I'm deadly serious, sir.",
        "Phillip: Let me explain a \"deadly.\" Let me ... Let me explain \"deadly\" to you, Ruth. Accidents happen all the time. You could be walking out of an office and get on an elevator and it could malfunction and you could plummet story after story down to the ground. It could happen. You know what? Who is to say that as you leave this police station tonight, you're not going to meet with an untimely accident?",
        "Gus: I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You sick freak. What is he doing here?",
        "Reva: Why don't we go outside and I'll explain it to you.",
        "Jonathan: Mom made me an offer I couldn't refuse: Free meal.",
        "Josh: Hey, Jonathan, you keep your mouth shut. You hear me?",
        "Cassie: You invited him here after what he did to Tammy?",
        "Jonathan: Nothing happened to Tammy that she didn't want to have happen.",
        "Josh: Just stop.",
        "Reva: Cassie.",
        "Cassie: I will kill you!",
        "Josh: Back away. I'm not going to tell you again.",
        "Reva: Look, Cassie, I know what you're going through.",
        "Cassie: You couldn't possibly, or he wouldn't be here, Reva. Tammy is gone, okay? Because of him. Because he violated her and you are feeding him dinner.",
        "Reva: Wait. Tammy's gone? What do you mean, Tammy's gone?",
        "Jonathan: Hit the road, huh? Packed up and left?",
        "Cassie: If anything else happens to her, I will rip you apart with my bare hands.",
        "Jonathan: Now, is that any way to talk to family?",
        "Cassie: You are nothing but a punk kid that deserves to be behind bars for the rest of your life.",
        "Reva: Cassie.",
        "Cassie: I thought I could come here for help, Reva.",
        "Reva: I will help you. Tell me what I can do.",
        "Jeffrey: What's going on?",
        "Jonathan: Whoa. Anybody ever tell you two you'd make a cute couple? Wow, you really are a ringer for my old man, all right?",
        "Jeffrey: Jonathan?",
        "Josh: It's time for you to go.",
        "Reva: Joshua, stop. Cassie, just tell me what I can do. I want to help you.",
        "Cassie: I'll take care of my daughter, thanks.",
        "Reva: Cassie. Cassie.",
        "Cassie: What has happened to you? Why are you protecting that monster? He ruined Tammy's life, Reva.",
        "Reva: Because he's my son. And if I can reach him in some small way ... You know what? Let's just talk about this in the car.",
        "Cassie: I don't want your help. You've made your choice.",
        "Reva: Cassie!",
        "Josh: I'll go after her.",
        "Jeffrey: Stay here, Josh. I'll make sure she's all right.",
        "Reva: What's happening to this family? What have I done?",
        "Josh: You haven't done anything, Reva. It's Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, I'm starving. So can we eat now or what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: I'm sorry. I thought that you knew about Jeffrey and Cassie.",
        "Edmund: No. No, I didn't. Glad he's with her. Didn't want her to go alone. Drink?",
        "Dinah: How come you didn't go?",
        "Edmund: Someone has to stay with the boy.",
        "Dinah: And the nanny couldn't handle it?",
        "Edmund: Nanny couldn't stay the night.",
        "Dinah: Hey, listen. Why don't you call Reva and make sure that Jeffrey and Cassie got there okay? You know, I mean, this isn't the first time that Cassie's taken off with Jeffrey and hasn't said anything. Like that night they had at that hotel in DC together.",
        "Edmund: Look, Dinah, we've danced to this song before. I trust Cassie. We love each other. She's not going to fall in love with Jeffrey O'Neill just because he happens to look exactly like her dead husband.",
        "Dinah: Well, you know what? You should keep talking, Edmund, because you almost believe yourself now. I'm going to be right back. I've got to get some ice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: So, are we eating or not?",
        "Josh: It's time for you to go. We'll have to do this another night.",
        "Jonathan: Whatever you say.",
        "Reva: No, I don't want you to leave.",
        "Jonathan: Reva ... (Telephone ringing)",
        "Reva: Look, pushing him away isn't going to solve anything.",
        "Jonathan: What's it going to be?",
        "Reva: I'm not sure. In fact, I'm not even sure of anything right now.",
        "Josh: I'll get the phone.",
        "Reva: But we have to start somewhere. So you stay.",
        "Josh: Hello?",
        "Edmund: Josh, it's Edmund Winslow.",
        "Josh: Yeah, Edmund. What do you want?",
        "Edmund: I was just wondering if Cassie made it there all right? She was going to stop by and pick up Reva on her way out of town.",
        "Josh: Cassie's been here and gone. She was pretty upset.",
        "Edmund: Yeah. Is Reva with her?",
        "Josh: No, Reva's still here. Jeffrey O'Neill went after Cassie. Hello? Edmund? You still there?",
        "Dinah: What's the verdict? (Glass shatters) Eddie, Eddie. I hate to say it, but I told you so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: Whose side are you on, here?",
        "Gus: I'm not on anybody's side. It's getting out of hand now, okay?",
        "Phillip: Yes, it's getting out of hand, Gus, because this woman is blackmailing me.",
        "Harley/Ruth: I prefer \"bargaining.\"",
        "Phillip: Gus, please. Please take care of this before I have to.",
        "Gus: Yeah, fine. Fine. You know what? I'll get Frank. We'll get her arrested, okay?",
        "Phillip: Yes.",
        "Gus: Is that what you want?",
        "Phillip: Yes.",
        "Harley/Ruth: Chief cooper? Well, now, I don't think that's a very good idea.",
        "Phillip: I think it's a great idea. Go get him. We'll let the judge decide.",
        "Gus: You take the chance. Fine.",
        "Phillip: Whoa, wait a minute. What chance?",
        "Gus: If she's arrested, she's going to start talking, okay? That means you're probably going to get arrested, too. Yes? You understand? And then it's going to open up a whole lot of things while this case is in court forever, and it's better if these things are left alone.",
        "Phillip: What are you suggesting that I do? You think that we should just give in to these ridiculous demands?",
        "Gus: No. I'm just saying don't do anything rash. And you know what? That goes for you, as well. Okay?",
        "Harley/Ruth: Well, I am going to leave you two gentlemen to discuss this further. Good day.",
        "Phillip: Ruth, you know you're not welcome to show your face around Spaulding anymore.",
        "Harley/Ruth: No, sir. Of course not. I won't be back until I receive the keys to your office.",
        "Phillip: (Laughs)",
        "Harley/Ruth: In the meantime, I will send what I know of recent events to my attorney in a sealed envelope. If by any chance I should meet with one of those untimely accidents, the police will receive the proper information. Yes. Mr. Aitoro, thank you again for saving my life. Don't forget what that means.",
        "Phillip: You know what? There's something about her that bothers me. Does it bother you? And what did that last thing that she say mean?",
        "Gus: It's an old expression. That thing it's, like, you know, you save somebody's life and you're responsible for them forever. You've heard it.",
        "Phillip: So now you and Ms. Karloff are bonded for life?",
        "Gus: Oh, for God's sakes, lighten up, will you, Phil? I'm the one that warned you about her in the first place, remember?",
        "Phillip: Then tell me, how do we make her go away?",
        "Gus: You've got to level with me. Did you put that hit on Ruth Karloff tonight?",
        "Phillip: I don't ... I don't believe this. I .... My own brother.",
        "Gus: Look, look at it this way, all right? This is strictly an attorney/client conversation and I need straight answers, or else this Ruth Karloff, she's going to bury you.",
        "Harley: Come on, Gus. You owe me. Let's crush him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Well, it's been ... Whatever. I'm going to take off.",
        "Reva: I hate this.",
        "Jonathan: Look, don't sweat it. The family thing just isn't me.",
        "Josh: Let him go, Reva.",
        "Reva: Jonathan, just wait. I mean, we have to work this out somehow.",
        "Jonathan: Look, at least old Joshua can breathe a sigh of relief.",
        "Reva: Well, you know, what do you expect? I mean, really. It hurts us that Cassie is in this much pain, and what you did to Tammy is inexcusable.",
        "Jonathan: What about what you did to me? And don't you think it freaked me out just now, seeing you and my father's double in the same room?",
        "Reva: I'm sorry. I didn't even realize.",
        "Jonathan: No. No, you were too busy taking care of good old Aunt Cassie. You know, everyone comes before me. Cassie, Josh, Shayne, Marah, even Sandy. Look, you don't have any room for me left anymore.",
        "Reva: That's not true.",
        "Jonathan: Forget it. You know what? Forget it. Forget me. I'm sorry I came over here, and I'm not coming back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: Why should I have any faith in you, Gus? You haven't given me any reason to trust you since the coopers first crossed us.",
        "Gus: No, no, wait a second, now. Phil, honestly. Who protected you when you were in Ravenwood, huh? Who had your back? I did. Who saved Spaulding Enterprises from the feds? Who protected Aunt Alex? I did that. I think I've done more than prove where my loyalties lie.",
        "Phillip: Yeah, well. I'm sorry, I'm fresh out of gold stars.",
        "Gus: Look, as far as I'm concerned, if you're responsible for making the hit and run on Sandy or getting somebody to mow down Ruth tonight, that's, you know, you're going to get what you deserve. Frankly, I wish I could walk away from the whole thing, I do, but I can't do that. And you want to know why? Because if somebody ends up getting killed, I can't really have that over my head. I've had enough. I cannot believe I've let this go as far as I have. I knew better. I knew better.",
        "Phillip: What do you mean, you knew better?",
        "Gus: Ruth Karloff is your mole at Spaulding Enterprises, okay? She's been working with Bill Lewis from the beginning, trying to take you down.",
        "Phillip: How long have you known that?",
        "Gus: For a little while now. The final piece just came into play.",
        "Phillip: Okay. Well, thank you for sharing. Gus, you don't need to do anything. I will take care of Bill and Ruth ...",
        "Gus: You're going to take care of it the way you took care of it tonight with Ruth? I don't think so. Phillip, too many people are getting hurt because of you. Yeah, the Cooper's, Sandy, Reva, now Ruth. No. I'm going to represent you, okay? And I'm going to get rid of Ruth Karloff, but we're going to do it my way. She likes money and power, fine. I'll make sure she's got plenty of both, but it's going to be far, far away from here.",
        "Phillip: Just do it fast.",
        "Gus: She'll be on a plane by tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: I'm sorry. I feel like I always bring you bad news.",
        "Edmund: Yes, well, so it would seem.",
        "Dinah: It's better to know things. I can handle the truth, no matter how awful it is. I just don't like it when people keep things from me. What are you going to do?",
        "Edmund: Killing him leaps to mind.",
        "Dinah: Well, that doesn't always turn out the way you want it to. Take it from someone who knows.",
        "Edmund: He's caused nothing but trouble for the people I love ever since he came to town. I could just make him disappear.",
        "Dinah: It wouldn't be easy. Jeffrey's pretty tough.",
        "Edmund: I'm not talking about Jeffrey O'Neill. It's Jonathan Randall I want to get rid of.",
        "Dinah: Because of what he did to Tammy?",
        "Edmund: Because of what he did to all of us. Cassie is on her way to Chicago to walk into a past she has spent years trying to forget. That past is coming back to haunt us because of him. And that is all of my fault.",
        "Dinah: You?",
        "Edmund: Richard and Reva sent Jonathan away as a baby because of me. He is angry and vengeful now because of me. I have to fix that mistake. I made him go away once. I can do it again.",
        "Dinah: I know how important family is to you.",
        "Edmund: They're the only thing I have, Dinah. I couldn't go back to being without them. I wouldn't.",
        "Dinah: I understand. I know. I know what it's like to risk everything you have just to be close to the people you love, so that you don't feel alone and lost. And the need to be loved is stronger than anything else, and worth any risk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Edmund's right. I really can't do this alone.",
        "Jeffrey: You don't have to.",
        "Cassie: You know, you have to stop following me.",
        "Jeffrey: Someone has to help you get Tammy back. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: You have to leave now.",
        "Dinah: I know it's very hard for you to believe that I understand what you're going through and that I care.",
        "Edmund: I asked you to leave.",
        "Dinah: Fine. But you can think about killing Jonathan all you want, but it's not going to happen because you do not have it in you.",
        "Edmund: You have no idea what I have in me.",
        "Dinah: I was there at the barn that night that you tried to kill Jeffrey with a shovel. And no matter how much you hate him, you would never leave him there to die in that barn. You went back in and you got him. So whatever killer instinct you think you have, it is no longer there. It's gone. Whether you like it or not, you're one of the good guys.",
        "Edmund: You're just going to have to wait and see, aren't you?",
        "Dinah: My bet is on that you are going to do the right thing. Or until you figure out what it is you want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Jonathan, now is not the time to leave.",
        "Jonathan: Well, it looks like you're outnumbered two to one against me staying.",
        "Josh: No argument there.",
        "Reva: What you said is very important.",
        "Jonathan: To you, maybe. Hey, don't worry. I didn't steal the silverware or anything. So long, mom.",
        "Reva: I'm going to call you.",
        "Josh: You tried.",
        "Reva: It almost happened. You know, I almost got through to him. He almost dropped the act. I could see the hurt.",
        "Josh: Maybe he was just showing you what he knows you want to see.",
        "Reva: You're not going to cut him any slack, are you?",
        "Josh: You want me to lie?",
        "Reva: No.",
        "Josh: Reva, look, I know you don't want to hear this but from what I've seen of this kid so far, the way he was tonight, he's dangerous and he's hateful.",
        "Reva: Well, whether he's dangerous or not, he's still my son and I'm not going to abandon him again. I just need to get out. I'm not ... Believe me, I'm not going to chase after him. I just ... I need some air. I'm going to take a walk.",
        "Josh: It's pretty cold out there.",
        "Reva: I'll be okay.",
        "Josh: Yeah. My name is Joshua Lewis. I'd like to report a stolen wallet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Where's Ruth?",
        "Harley: She's in the bag.",
        "Gus: Oh.",
        "Harley: Safe and sound.",
        "Gus: Good. Make sure she stays there, okay? Were you followed?",
        "Harley: No, I wasn't followed, and I was very careful when I got out of my disguise. Don't worry. I've been doing this for a while. I haven't been caught yet.",
        "Gus: Yeah, well, things have changed, okay? I've outed Ruth as the mole. You've got to be careful. Phillip's on the warpath. You might want to warn your little boyfriend bill about that, as well. Okay?",
        "Harley: Did you get anything on tape that we can use against Phillip?",
        "Gus: I thought I almost had him, but he's not about to open up with me.",
        "Harley: Well, then we can't let up because I know that Phillip will crack if we just keep up the pressure with Ruth.",
        "Gus: You want to die in a wig and a fat suit? Are you a meat loaf? Just ... I'll take it from here, okay?",
        "Harley: What are you going to do? You just said the man doesn't trust you.",
        "Gus: He will trust me when he finds out that I have paid Ruth off, I've put her on a plane out of the country. I'm on my way to the airport right now to handle that.",
        "Harley: That's good. Wait. Listen ...",
        "Gus: Just go home to your kids.",
        "Harley: I don't have a home anymore. Remember? That's why I'm doing all this.",
        "Gus: I'm sorry.",
        "Harley: Listen. About earlier tonight, you know, saving my life and all.",
        "Gus: I owed you that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: What do you mean, you lost her? I told you not to let Ruth Karloff out of your sight. All right. Here's what you're going to do. You're going to find her and you're going to take care of this, as we discussed. Ruth Karloff has to go away tonight. Do not call me until the job is finished.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Hey, Bill, it's me. Listen, can you get away from your bride for a little while and meet me at Beacon? Thanks. And bring Ruth's backup wig and some extra clothes. Yeah. Ruth needs one last fling."
