        "Sandy: Tammy and I are meeting the minister this morning but don't worry, I'll finish this first. Olivia...",
        "Olivia: Hi. ( Cell phone rings ) Wow, already that kind of day.",
        "Olivia: Room service. Fresh ideas right here. I had a brainstorm. I figured out how we can cut development costs on the Japanese project by 30%.",
        "Josh: That's fantastic. I don't know how you do it Olivia.",
        "Olivia: I've got a knack for business.",
        "Josh: I'm talking about dealing with Emma on your own right now without Bill around. Sorry, it's not that he's not coming back or anything, I just...",
        "Olivia: I just... I need to stay busy and get myself into some other things and I really need to thank you for that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Billy?",
        "Jonathan: No! (Laughs)",
        "Cassie: I'm looking for Billy?",
        "Jonathan: I got that. What's up?",
        "Cassie: Well, um, okay. I'm having a situation at the Beacon. I have a champagne brunch scheduled. I don't think I have enough champagne, so I was going to ask Billy if I could buy a couple cases from him. Hello? I'm talking to you, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: How many do you need? Two? Three? Don't worry, I won't rip you off. As a matter of fact, it's on the house, so how many?",
        "Cassie: Um, two. Are you sure you can spare two?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, yeah. The crowd in here is more brewski than bubbly any way. No big deal. So how's everything going. Like the wedding plans, everything on track?",
        "Cassie: Good.",
        "Jonathan: I guess you guys kind of really need this right now, huh, after, like, losing the baby and everything?",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Jonathan: You think Tammy is going to be happy with Sandy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Busy, I have ever minute planned between now and this wedding. Like today. Sandy and I are meeting with the minister this morning and then this afternoon I have an appointment at the dress warehouse. But it's okay. I'm cool. I know exactly how I want this wedding to go. I have it all planned out in my head. There will be lots of pink, but it won't be too girly or 'fessy. Simple and elegant. Just like my dress. I know exactly what I want, something romantic, traditional. Mom and Jeffrey will be there, as happy as I've ever seen them. Then when the music starts, Uncle Josh will take my arm then walk me down the aisle. And down at the end waiting for me will be my groom, the man I love. What? Yeah. I'm still here. But I have to go. Yeah, all these plans.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Of course he's going to make her happy. He's going to give her everything she wants and she needs. You don't think Tammy deserves that.",
        "Jonathan: No, Tammy saved my life. I only want what's best for her.",
        "Cassie: Well, that's something we have in common.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. I'll... I'll take these out to your car for you.",
        "Cassie: No, no, don't bother because I'm going to have someone come and pick it up. I'm not going to the Beacon right now. Thank you.",
        "Jonathan: We're family, right?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. See you later.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, Cassie. If you or Tammy need anything for the wedding or whatever, just call me.",
        "Dinah: Now, gee, did I walk in on the wrong place? Because I was looking for a little company but I had no idea I was going to step into the good deed jamboree.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Whoo. All right, then. You know what? I'm going to take a picture. Seriously.",
        "Josh: (Laughs)",
        "Olivia: This is the kind of thing that would cinch the deal. Josh Lewis himself, president of the company working hard to make their project a reality. Dedication is impressive. I'm impressed.",
        "Josh: Coming from a workaholic, I'll take that as a compliment. Thank you very much.",
        "Olivia: I'm trying to acknowledge a kindred spirit.",
        "( Knock on door )",
        "Josh: Will you get that for me?",
        "Reva: Do I have the wrong suite? I could have sworn that this was Josh's. Is he here?",
        "Olivia: I'll check. Are you here, Josh?",
        "Josh: Yup.",
        "Olivia: He's here.",
        "Josh: Hey, hello.",
        "Reva: Surprise.",
        "Josh: What are you doing here?",
        "Reva: Well, um, apparently I'm interrupting.",
        "Olivia: No we were just working.",
        "Josh: We're working on a big project for Japan. Come on over, take a look, I've been on it all night.",
        "Olivia: Oh, an office complex.",
        "Josh: We have a theater thing happening here and a shopping mall over there. I'm sorry, I'm guessing you didn't come here because you wanted to look at our proposal.",
        "Reva: No, I came because I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed the time we spent together last night.",
        "Josh: I enjoyed it, too.",
        "Reva: Good. Then I thought maybe we could talk, you know, about our future. That is, of course, if you can drag yourself away from your work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: I'm a Boy Scout.",
        "Dinah: You're certainly giving off that vibe. Then again I think world might be spinning off its axis.",
        "Jonathan: What makes you say that?",
        "Dinah: Everybody's changing.",
        "Jonathan: Guess so. Unspiked O.J. for Dinah Marler?",
        "Dinah: That's right. You're looking at the new improved Dinah Marler.",
        "Jonathan: Meaning?",
        "Dinah: Meaning no more self- pity. No more obsessions. No more living to make people miserable.",
        "Jonathan: Well, what's left?",
        "Dinah: From now on I'm going to go ahead and set positive goals for myself. Utilize my skills for positive means. Even more positive than giving away boxes of free booze. Are you nuts?",
        "Jonathan: Don't worry about it. It's a peace offering.",
        "Dinah: Peace offering? Why don't I completely believe you?",
        "Jonathan: Probably for the same reasons that I don't believe you.",
        "Dinah: No, no, no. Now, I am changing my life.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, keep saying it.",
        "Dinah: Hey, you want proof? Okay. You want to know how you let go of the past? You simplify things. You make sure that you let go of the things that used to tie you down or tie you up.",
        "Jonathan: (Laughs)",
        "Dinah: And then you stick to what's called a no strings attached policy.",
        "Jonathan: Travel light.",
        "Dinah: Exactly. That way you won't hurt anybody or be tempted to really hurt them back. You know, there was a day that you and I, we... I don't know, we kept things light. We traveled real light. We had that no-strings-attached kind of thing. We didn't have any expectations on one another and we got to do lots of fun things. Great things and, I don't know, maybe we should do some more of those things. Hmm?",
        "Jonathan: Hmm...",
        "Dinah: Oh. I get it. You're not a boy scout. You're in love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Mom?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. You caught me.",
        "Tammy: Hey... hey, if it's too soon, we can postpone this.",
        "Cassie: The wedding?",
        "Tammy: I mean, I'd be okay with it. You just had to give up Hope.",
        "Cassie: No, no, no! You're not postponing the wedding!",
        "Tammy: Maybe it's happen too soon.",
        "Cassie: Are you kidding he? This wedding isn't happening soon enough. I'm telling you, this wedding is exactly what this family needs, honey. It is, it's going to give us joy and it's going to give us hope and...",
        "Tammy: Oh, mom.",
        "Cassie: No, it's okay. It's okay and I'm okay. You know what I keep thinking about? I keep thinking about your amazing sense of timing.",
        "Tammy: What?",
        "Cassie: Yes. Ever since you were a little girl you had this knack for picking up people's spirits whenever they were down.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, right.",
        "Cassie: You did. It's true, I'm telling you. Do you know, when you were about a year old I lost this job that I really needed and when I came home I just felt like my life was over. And that was the day you took your first step. And then I felt like my life was starting all over again. See?",
        "Tammy: Well, I'm sure it was just a coincidence.",
        "Cassie: Maybe, but it happened over and over and over again. You've got something, girl. You do. You really, really affect people. Even Jonathan.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. I ran into him at Outskirts and he is really happy if you and Sandy and he thinks you deserve this happiness. So that's how strong your power is. You even affected Jonathan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: I would love nothing more than to talk about... (Cell phone rings) than to talk about our future. Excuse me for just one second, okay? It's Japan again. I'll be as quick as I can, I promise.",
        "Reva: You and Josh seem to be working together a lot lately.",
        "Olivia: Oh, well, it's very satisfying.",
        "Reva: Why do it otherwise?",
        "Olivia: I couldn't agree more. I just have a lot of time on my hands and Josh needs me and here I am. What works, works. Right?",
        "Reva: Right.",
        "Olivia: Kind of like the two of you at the party last night. You were dancing so sweetly. It was nice and I'm happy to see the two of you can still be friends.",
        "Reva: Friends?",
        "Olivia: Yeah, Josh and I were talking about it after you left last night.",
        "Reva: On your way to doing business?",
        "Olivia: Yeah, look. He implied and I have to admit that maybe the two of you are better off just...",
        "Josh: You don't have to do that.",
        "Olivia: I can't help myself. I like things neat.",
        "Reva: Like hell.",
        "Olivia: I have to go back to the office. I'm sure you two have to talk. I'll call you later.",
        "Josh: Thanks again for last night. I appreciate it.",
        "Olivia: It's timing.",
        "Josh: See you. Are you all right?",
        "Reva: I'm fine, great.",
        "Josh: Good. So what's up? I have to admit, though, I'm hoping you stopped by because you want to pick up whereupon we left off last night.",
        "Reva: Actually, I'm here to say good-bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: So when did it exactly happen to you, Jonathan? When did it get you?",
        "Jonathan: Good-bye, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: Okay, okay. Who's the lucky girl?",
        "Jonathan: It's none of your business.",
        "Dinah: Ah-ha! I am right! You are in love! Hey, it's nothing to be ashamed of. Scared of, maybe, considering how much it can mess you up, but I think that love can be a wonderful thing. I've heard that, anyway. Look, whatever happens, I think that you know the next step. I mean, you've just got to admit to yourself that it's happened to you.",
        "Jonathan: Well, I didn't ask for it to happen.",
        "Dinah: What is the problem?",
        "Jonathan: She's with somebody else.",
        "Dinah: Of course. Let me tell you something, you cut that loose.",
        "Jonathan: Just like that?",
        "Dinah: Just like that. Jonathan, I have fallen in love twice in my life. The first time the guy ended up dead. The second time, I almost did. Then the guy almost did.",
        "Jonathan: That's a lot of dead people.",
        "Dinah: Disaster! Both times! You know why? I thought I was second best.",
        "Jonathan: I'm not second best.",
        "Dinah: That's what I thought. But let me tell you something, you get out of this while you can.",
        "Jonathan: It's too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: When did you talk to Jonathan? What were you doing at Outskirts?",
        "Cassie: Well, I had a problem at the Beacon and he actually helped me. And he was really nice, if you can believe that. Do you want some jam?",
        "Tammy: Uh-uh. And he said what about me and Sandy?",
        "Cassie: He hopes you guys are very happy.",
        "Tammy: Those were his exact words?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Something like that. He seemed to genuinely care.",
        "Tammy: That's nice.",
        "Cassie: Well, that just goes to show you that you just being you can even affect some twisted soul like Jonathan.",
        "Tammy: Mom, he has been hurt really badly.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, well, so have you. At his hand. And what he did to you, honey, there aren't even words for that. But, come here. You know what amazes me and comforts me? It's that you haven't changed at all. Not deep down. You are still that sweet, beautiful little girl that you always have been.",
        "Tammy: What if I'm not the same person? What if I did change? I mean, I grew up, right? Enough to get married.",
        "Cassie: I'm so proud of you. I am, you know? And you just give us all hope. Wow, every time I say her name, it's just...",
        "Tammy: Mom, don't.",
        "Cassie: You know what? I'm not going to be sad forever. I'm not. And I have you to focus on because you're getting married. I know I'm your mom and all and it's probably weird that I say this, but you're such an inspiration to me.",
        "Tammy: Come on.",
        "Cassie: I mean it. Baby, you... you light up my life like some beacon of hope. Hope. It's hard but it's a lot easier to say with you around.",
        "Tammy: Don't. Mom, I... I want to be all those things, a beacon, an inspiration to you and to Sandy but I don't know if I can.",
        "Cassie: Why not? What's wrong?",
        "Tammy: I am!",
        "Cassie: Hey, what's going on?",
        "Tammy: I try so hard, Mom, I really do.",
        "Cassie: Come sit down with me.",
        "Tammy: I don't want to sit! I just want...",
        "Cassie: What? What's going on?",
        "Tammy: I just want to know that I can do this.",
        "Cassie: You mean get married?",
        "Tammy: When Sandy was in the hospital, I made a promise to God that I'd be good and do everything right as long as he walked out of there alive.",
        "Cassie: And he did walk out alive and you do everything right, honey.",
        "Tammy: No, I'm not. I'm not at all! I'm screwing up!",
        "Cassie: What are you doing that you shouldn't be doing? What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Thank you, Reverend, I really appreciate you meeting with us today.",
        "Reverend Rutledge: My pleasure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Don't worry. I think I'm just having a pre-wedding freakout.",
        "Cassie: Are you sure that's all this is?",
        "Tammy: I have a lot to do today and I lost it for a second.",
        "Cassie: It seems like more than just nerves, though, honey.",
        "Tammy: No, look at me. I'm fine, especially now that Sandy's here.",
        "Sandy: Well, hello Beautiful.",
        "Tammy: Hi.",
        "Sandy: You know Reverend Rutledge.",
        "Tammy: Of course. Hello.",
        "Reverend Rutledge: Well hello.",
        "Cassie: Well, I have to get over to the Beacon because I have a trunk full of wedding stuff I need to go through so go please get, get in. Enjoy yourself.",
        "Reverend Rutledge: Thanks.",
        "Cassie: Maybe something will come in handy.",
        "Tammy: Perfect.",
        "Cassie: I'll meet you later to look at dresses, all right?",
        "Tammy: All right, great, Mom, you're the best.",
        "Cassie: I am? Okay. Well, I will be seeing you later definitely.",
        "Sandy: Definitely.",
        "Cassie: Bye.",
        "Tammy: Bye. I seem glad you're here. Want to get started?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: What's the new and improved Dinah up to these days now that she can't chase around my Uncle Eddie! (Laughs)",
        "Dinah: Hey! I haven't figured that part out yet.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, you got nothing! You got no goal, you have to thing to look forward to. I mean, why would I want to put myself in that boat?",
        "Dinah: You know why? Because it beats the hell out of loving somebody who doesn't love you back.",
        "Jonathan: Who said she didn't love me back?",
        "Dinah: She's with somebody else.",
        "Jonathan: Good point.",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Why if she does love you?",
        "Jonathan: It's complicated.",
        "Dinah: I bet it is. You know something? For the record, I will rebuild my life.",
        "Jonathan: Whoa!",
        "Dinah: I will. And this time I'm not going to be controlled by the whims of a man.",
        "Jonathan: Unless you fall in love with him.",
        "Dinah: Yeah. That's not going to happen.",
        "Jonathan: We'll see.",
        "Dinah: That's not going to happen, you know why? Because I used to think that the love from, you know, the right kind of guy would somehow save me from myself but see that can't work. That's not a good thing. Just makes the bad parts worse. Makes you feel lonelier and if you were just alone.",
        "Jonathan: Are you still talking? So how are you feeling? Are you happy now that you're a solo act?",
        "Dinah: Yes, I'm very happy.",
        "Jonathan: I don't understand. You have no drive, no direction, no reason to get up in the morning. Don't you think it's better to chase after the wrong thing than to have nothing to chase after at all?",
        "Dinah: Not for me. Not anymore.",
        "Jonathan: Well, then we're definitely different boats. Good luck.",
        "Dinah: Thanks. (Laughs) But I think that you're the one who's going to need the luck. You know what?",
        "Jonathan: Hmm?",
        "Dinah: For the record, your loss.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Hey.",
        "Cassie: What are you doing here?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, this is breakfast and I'm waiting for you.",
        "Cassie: I thought you had to work.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I did but when you called to tell me that you had to come over here and get this trunk I figured I'd make your truck a little bit more worthwhile.",
        "Cassie: Do I smell bacon?",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, you smell bacon Canadian bacon and bell June waffles, French toast, American beauty roses. Kind of like a... a U.N. Breakfast.",
        "Cassie: Wow. All of my favorite things. Including you. So what is this really about?",
        "Jeffrey: Besides a large check at the local restaurant?",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I, you know, I wanted you to feel better. I know how much you miss Hope. I know because I miss her, too, and I don't know if you need more talk, less talk more space, less space. So you know what? I settled on eggs.",
        "Cassie: I don't know what I need, either. Maybe time, you know?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you know, you just take all the time you need.",
        "Cassie: Time and bacon. (Laughs)",
        "Jeffrey: Time and bacon! Breakfast of champions, I always say.",
        "Cassie: Okay, good. Well, I'm also here to look in this trunk, you know? There's a wonderful girl named Tammy Winslow who's getting married and I don't know if you know her.",
        "Jeffrey: Are you hiding her there in the trunk?",
        "Cassie: Very funny. No, these are all my wedding mementos in here.",
        "Jeffrey: Wow! Looks like a lifetime full of you have there.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Just doesn't seem like mine. I mean, the lifetime. The mementos do: But, wow. Look, there's so many memories.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: I thought we reconnected, you know, just a little bit.",
        "Reva: We did.",
        "Josh: So what is this about?",
        "Reva: It's about our house.",
        "Josh: You want to say good- bye to our house?",
        "Reva: Well, it's had a lot of problems, lately. You know, it's old and it's been through a lot and it seems like that more we try to fix it, the more things go wrong.",
        "Josh: So you're thinking we should just let it all go? I mean, the house?",
        "Reva: Well, it's one solution.",
        "Josh: Assuming that there are real problems there.",
        "Reva: Oh, there are problems you know? It's leaky and there's cracks and...",
        "Josh: But the foundation, the bones of the house are so strong. Leaks and cracks, those things can be repaired. There's nothing that can't be fixed.",
        "Reva: It's just everything's changing, Bud.",
        "Josh: Everything always does, Reva.",
        "Reva: But it's never been like this and I don't know how to start over.",
        "Josh: Reva, we don't ... we don't have to start over if we don't end anything, right?",
        "Reva: Maybe it's already finished?",
        "Josh: Not where from where I stand! Reva, come on! You may want to let go of our house but I don't! I'm not ready to do that! I'm a long way from taking that step!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Wait. Wait.",
        "Cassie: I didn't mean to, um...",
        "Jeffrey: Can I see it? Please? You don't have to hide this from me, you know. It's not a secret. Handsome guy.",
        "Cassie: You think? I'm sorry. I don't mean to keep losing it like this.",
        "Jeffrey: It's okay. It's all right. You're hurting.",
        "Cassie: I just feel like I'm one big raw nerve.",
        "Jeffrey: And here's a reminder of maybe the happiest time of your life staring you righting in the face. How could it not get to you?",
        "Cassie: How can I not think about my wedding to Richard when I'm planning Tammy's, you know? Wow. This is so weird. This just seems like it was so long ago. Tammy was just talking about Richard last night, you know, saying how he wasn't going to be around for the wedding. She loved him so much.",
        "Jeffrey: You know, she doesn't have to walk down the aisle alone. I mean, if she wants, if you want, I could...",
        "Cassie: Stand in for Richard? (Laughs) Well, you'd be perfect.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: But I think she's going to ask Josh.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, good. All right.",
        "Cassie: It's awful generous and sweet of you. But then again, you are generous and sweet, so... and you mean more to me and my family than I think you realize.",
        "Jeffrey: You don't have to put that away. I've seen firsthand how much Richard meant to you.",
        "Cassie: Firsthand?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. I mean, I've seen the look on your face when you talk about him. You look at his picture so, you know, it's all right. You can leave that out.",
        "Cassie: You're wonderful. Thank you. Well, I guess I should go get myself cleaned up before I meet Tammy at the bridal warehouse.",
        "Jeffrey: (Sighs) Well, you would know what to do to make her feel better. Well, you would know what to do to make her feel better. I'm not sure that I do. So I'm just trying to put myself in your shoes, again.",

        "Reverend Rutledge: I'm going to ask you the question I ask every couple before I marry them. What is it that you love about each other?",
        "Sandy: Oh, that's easy. Tammy's beautiful and intelligent, generous, kind.",
        "Tammy: Sandy's what every girl should want: Sweet and funny and he never disappoints me.",
        "Sandy: She's incredibly gentle and at the same time not a pushover. I love that.",
        "Tammy: Sandy's beyond being a great guy. He's the perfect guy in every way.",
        "Reverend Rutledge: Well, you're both young and although love is crucial, marriage takes commitment. Are you ready to forsake all others as the wedding vows would have you do?",
        "Tammy: Definitely. And my family can't wait to have Sandy be part of it. I mean, our wedding has become, like, the light at the end of this year-long tunnel for practically all of my relatives. It's been rough. So I can't wait, either.",
        "Reverend Rutledge: Well, Tammy, I'm glad that you have empathy for your loved ones but you shouldn't feel like you have to get married because it's expected of you or because you're wanting to please your family. You have to follow your own destiny.",
        "Tammy: It's not about my family. Honest.",
        "Sandy: In your opinion, Reverend, when should people get married?",
        "Reverend Rutledge: When they know they simply can't live without each other.",
        "Sandy: Well, we're there with you there. That's exactly how we feel.",

        "Olivia: Don't tell me you're sorry? Okay? I've been calling everyday for weeks and you won't put me through to my husband. I don't care if they are his instructions! I need to speak with him. Damn you!",
        "Jonathan: Hey, I heard Bill left. Sorry.",

        "Reva: Yet.",
        "Josh: I don't want her, I want you! And the only strategy I care about is the only one that's going to get us back together again, Reva, because we've been sitting in awful holding pattern for what seems like a year!",
        "Reva: And I'm sorry. It's because of the choices I made and the things I needed, just kind of screwed everything up. I took something that was good and solid and real and I ruined it.",
        "Josh: Reva, I'm telling you, it's nothing... there's nothing that can't be fixed.",
        "Reva: No. We have been down this road so many times before, Bud, we have. We can't just turn around and go back the way we came!",
        "Josh: No, we can't. But we can go forward, Reva. Together, we can go forward. Really, what's keeping us from doing that?",
        "Reva: Nothing, everything, I don't know.",
        "Josh: Come along with me, then, okay? Let's just do it and see what happens. We'll get out the hammers and nails and start pounding away, figure out what we have to do to make our home a better place.",
        "Reva: You really think we can?",
        "Josh: I believe in us, Reva.",
        "Reva: But we're in such a different place.",
