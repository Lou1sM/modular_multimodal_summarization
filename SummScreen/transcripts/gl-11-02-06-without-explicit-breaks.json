        "Billy: Hi, I'm billy. I'm an alcoholic.",
        "Group: Hi, billy.",
        "Billy: I fell off the wagon recently-- no, I didn't fall off; I jumped off. I got myself really plastered. I, um... see, I had to say good- bye to a friend and it was really hard. So, the old devils kicked in and I wanted to get myself numb. I don't know what happened, but unexpectedly, this friend, she came back and saved my butt again. It cost her a lot to do it, too. So now I'm back at square one. One day at a time, and I've also got to be strong for her, even if it'S... even if it's just to let her go.",
        "Beth: Don't do this.",
        "Alan: Do what?",
        "Beth: Intrude on the lewises. You're the last person that they want to see right now.",
        "Alan: Reva is an old friend of mine. We're practically family.",
        "Beth: Are you using this painful situation to get at lizzie's baby, is that it?",
        "Alan: You have it all figured out, don't you, beth?",
        "Beth: I deserve to know what's going on. I'm lizzie's mother and I'm your wife.",
        "Alan: Perhaps you should have thought about that before you cheated on me with rick bauer.",
        "Mel: And her breathing was good all night.",
        "Rick: Why don't you go home and get some rest?",
        "Mel: I will after I talk to cassie. I told her I would give her an update on reva's condition.",
        "Rick: I can do it.",
        "Mel: No, I want to do it. Cassie's my good friend.",
        "Rick: I can't imagine what they're going through.",
        "Mel: I can. I mean, I remember standing vigil all night when you were in there with your heart.",
        "Rick: Let's have a family dinner tonight, all right? I'll build a fire and we'll cook over the coals just like we used to.",
        "Mel: I can't think about that right now, okay? Reva.",
        "Rick: You know what, sometimes you've got to keep on living, sweetheart. That's all you can do.",
        "Josh: I have to get up. I have to make a phone call. Yeah, could I speak with dr. Switzer, please? Thank you. Hi, dr. Switzer, it's josh lewis calling. I was wondering if you got reva lewis' chart. Great. Is it possible you could come to springfield then, because I have a plane I can send for you... I'm sorry. How could you possibly know that if you haven't seen her? Don't you have to see her and run some tests? Okay, all right. Well, yeah, I'm sorry, too. But, you know what, if you won't help her, then I'll just have to find somebody who can. So thank you for your time. I really appreciate it. ( Car engine revving ) I wish that I could fly up to the sky so very high...",
        "Jonathan: Uh... need somebody in here! The alarm-- she needs help! I need somebody in here! Captioning sponsored by procter & gamble productions, inc. And cbs",
        "Josh: I'm sorry.",
        "Cassie: Don't be. You should see what I've done to my laptop.",
        "Josh: It's the damned doctors, you know. All they think about is liability and odds. And I'm just going to have to keep trying until I find somebody who will take reva's case.",
        "Cassie: Right. We'll keep trying. Did you sleep at all?",
        "Josh: Did you?",
        "Cassie: How about some coffee? How about I make some coffee?",
        "Josh: No, thank you. I'm fine. I just need to sort of keep moving. I've got to do things.",
        "Cassie: You know, whenever rj is sick, he wants the things around him to make him happy. He snuggles up with his soccer ball, or baseball cards or...",
        "Josh: I don't think a soccer ball is going to do it for reva.",
        "Cassie: Well, maybe not a soccer ball, but there are other things. Familiar things. Sarah's cameo. This is what brought me and reva together. I want her to have it. I'm going to take it to her.",
        "Josh: Surround her with things that she loves.",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Josh: Yeah, because her room is sterile and lifeless, and life is exactly what she needs right? So we can go to the house and get some things and make her room seem more like a home.",
        "Cassie: Like a home.",
        "Josh: Like a home, exactly. Do you think it's possible i could get the mantel off the wall, huh?",
        "Cassie: You could try.",
        "Alan: Rick, you're ears must have been burning. We were just talking about you.",
        "Rick: Great, the gang's all here.",
        "Alan: Don't assume it was the worst. After all, there's a part of me that understands your little indiscretion with my wife, trying to recapture your youth.",
        "Rick: Alan, whatever you have to say, I prefer you say it now, so we can just get it over with?",
        "Alan: How can you be so glib about sleeping with my wife?",
        "Beth: Alan, let's not do this here, okay?",
        "Alan: Oh, I think dr. Bauer's a little concerned that I might try to make him suffer for what he's done to me.",
        "Rick: Oh, is that so? Am I?",
        "Alan: I think you should be because there are things I've done to people who've done a lot less, rick.",
        "Beth: This is crazy.",
        "Alan: Crazy, huh? Then why do you keep calling him? And it's very good that you don't return her phone calls, too.",
        "Beth: So you're still having us followed?",
        "Rick: Are you through, alan?",
        "Alan: Almost. Don't be nervous, rick. We're old friends. I'm going to have a word with the good doctor.",
        "Jonathan: Is she okay?",
        "Mel: She's stable for the moment.",
        "Jonathan: For the moment? How many times is that going to happen?",
        "Mel: She's comfortable. There's not much else I could do.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, but what happened to her? The machine was going crazy.",
        "Mel: Her heart rate dropped, and so did her blood pressure.",
        "Jonathan: Is that normal for...",
        "Mel: There's nothing really normal. Her body is getting progressively weaker.",
        "Jonathan: So that's just it?",
        "Mel: Listen, just be with her, okay? Hold her hand, let her know that you're here. Go ahead.",
        "Reva: I'm glad you're here.",
        "Jonathan: Where else would i be?",
        "Reva: With tammy. She needs you.",
        "Jonathan: No, I need to be here with you. And you need to save your strength, so you need to rest.",
        "Reva: Save it.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, anything you need, anything you want, you just say it and I'll get it.",
        "Reva: Joshua. I need to know that he's okay.",
        "Cassie: Did reva have a favorite pair of pajamas or robe? Josh? She's gonna love this, you know, bringing her all her favorite things and...",
        "Josh: \"Dear joshua...\" reva told me about this. She didn't make any sense at the time, but...",
        "Cassie: Is that a letter that she left?",
        "Josh: She was talking about how marah used to hide her letters to santa at the mantel, and she told me to look for it around christmastime. She must have known that I would read it after she... would you mind?",
        "Cassie: Sure.",
        "Josh: Thank you.",
        "Cassie: \"Dear joshua, I'm writing this letter because i don't want there to be anything left unsaid between us after I'm gone. I want you to know, even though we're not together anymore, that you have been my life, bud, my heart and my soul, and your happiness and the happiness of our children, now and in the future, is the most important thing in the world to me.\"",
        "Alan: You know, many people's favorite time of the year is summer and spring. But I like autumn. Yes, I like to see the leaves fall from the trees because you can see what they've been hiding for months.",
        "Rick: You know, I would recite a poem, too, but I think people would talk. So why don't we just get on with it? Whatever you have to say or do, just do it so I can get back to work.",
        "Alan: It wouldn't be any fun because I wouldn't be able to see you squirm.",
        "Rick: I'm not squirming, alan.",
        "Alan: You sure about that?",
        "Rick: Whatever happened between beth and me was a mistake.",
        "Alan: It didn't happen. It was a choice that you made, just like the choice I'm going to make in to how to deal with you.",
        "Rick: It's over, alan. You know it's over. And I didn't do this to hurt you. You know, beth and I have had a connection...",
        "Alan: Don't try to justify your affair with my wife, rick.",
        "Rick: Okay. So what are you going to do to me, alan? Are you going to have me fired?",
        "Alan: Well, I thought about that.",
        "Rick: But?",
        "Alan: Well, it's not very creative, rick, and it's not painful enough.",
        "Rick: Well, you can certainly run a sleazy article in that rag of yours, the \"mirror.\" Make it real juicy.",
        "Alan: Believe me, I've thought of plenty ways to make you suffer for what you've done. But I'll let you wonder what alan spaulding will do to the man who slept with his wife.",
        "Beth: Mel, hi.",
        "Mel: Beth.",
        "Beth: How's reva doing?",
        "Mel: Not well.",
        "Beth: That's terrible. Her poor family. How are you?",
        "Mel: You're joking, right?",
        "Beth: No. Well, I know that you and rick have been working around the clock on reva's case. It must be very trying.",
        "Mel: Did he tell you that?",
        "Beth: No. My daughter is married to reva's son, remember?",
        "Mel: Yeah.",
        "Beth: Mel, why can't we just have a civil conversation?",
        "Mel: Why would I want to?",
        "Beth: Rick and I are friends.",
        "Mel: You're fishing to see if my husband and I have patched things up.",
        "Beth: Well, have you?",
        "Mel: Unbelievable. How do you look at yourself in the mirror?",
        "Beth: I manage.",
        "Mel: No remorse whatsoever. I don't know why it should surprise me. I mean, you married philip, and now you're married to alan. My grandmother used to say the fruit was rotten long before the worms got to it.",
        "Beth: Like you were ever any kind of wife to rick.",
        "Mel: Good-bye, beth.",
        "Beth: You know, my grandmother used to say \"don't dish it out if you can't take it.\" Well, okay, she didn't say that, but it's true all the same.",
        "Mel: You know what? It's too bad I took that doctor's oath to do no harm because if I wasn't in this white gown right now...",
        "Beth: Violence? Is that all you have left now? Hey, good luck on that next marriage because this one's not going to work.",
        "Billy: Lord... first of all, let me just say I'm sorry for all the lying and the drinking and the encyclopedia full of impure thoughts, but I'm a little lost here and I need your help. Like you didn't know that, right? It's my friend reva. I mean, I don't understand why she had to go through what she had to go through and you know how I feel, but I'M... I'm really not asking for a miracle. I just... well, she's in a lot of pain, and it's tough. So if you could... I don't know, just try to lighten up on her, and maybe let her go easy, I'd appreciate it. Amen. Look, while you're at it, do you think you could give me a little strength, just prop me up a bit? I mean it's really hard for me when I walk into that... that hospital and I see her full of tubes, and I want to be strong for her because she needs me. I mean, I just want to be her billy, okay?",
        "Jonathan: Definitely time to get some new magazines in this place.",
        "Reva: Joshua...",
        "Jonathan: What about him, reva? Got a big smile on his face and a spring in his step.",
        "Reva: Hey.",
        "Jonathan: Hey. Look, he's just like me and billy were when we found out, okay? But we've had months. You know? We had a chance to say good-bye. Hey... lizzie's going for her sonogram today. Don't get worried. It's just, like, normal because of that scare and all of that. The baby is fine, and lizzie's fine, too. And I'll bring you a new picture from the machine if you're good.",
        "Reva: Promise me that you won't let anybody tell you that you aren't going to be a good daddy to that little baby. Promise me.",
        "Jonathan: I promise. I promise you. I promise you I won't let anybody tell me that.",
        "Reva: And don't let anybody separate the two of you like we were separated. Especially alan, because I won't be here to help you fight it.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. I will not let anybody separate me from that little girl. Even if it means taking on alan, then I'll do it. Okay? Reva shane style, both guns blazing. Me and that little girl are going to get to do all of the stuff that you and me didn't get to do.",
        "Cassie: \"No matter what happens to me, joshua, you will always be the love of my life. That's how the story began and how it will end. With love always, reva.\" It's a beautiful letter, josh.",
        "Josh: Yes, it is. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have... I shouldn't have asked you to...",
        "Cassie: No, it's okay. All I care about is supporting reva, and she needs us. She needs you and she needs her family and she needs this piece of home from cross creek.",
        "Josh: I don't know what to say. Thank you. You are...",
        "Cassie: No, I'm not. No, I'm not.",
        "Josh: You are. You are the most selfless woman I have ever known, cassie. And you're right. Once reva gets our love and support, and we're going to give her tons of it, she's going to have no choice but to get better, so...",
        "Cassie: Josh... josh, what did you just say?",
        "Josh: I think we need to get going.",
        "Cassie: No. You'll said she'll get better. Josh, reva... she's dying. Josh, she's dying. And no matter how much you want to, you can't save her.

        "Cassie: Look, this is tearing me up inside, too. I don't want to lose my sister. But all of the doctors have said that she is not going to...",
        "Josh: No, they think the cancer is gone. That's what they've said.",
        "Cassie: They said her body is failing, and that they've have tried everything.",
        "Josh: Well, then they're going to have to try some other thing; that's all. Cassie, they're doctors, okay? They say things, they cover themselves. Besides, we've all... we've all heard about people who are at the end, you know, and then suddenly, bang, they're well. It happens, and nobody knows why. Nobody has the answers, but there they are, they're walking around.",
        "Cassie: And what if that doesn't happen? Josh, I'm just saying that we have to be prepared.",
        "Josh: Reva is not dying! She's not dying.",
        "Cassie: Josh, when richard was in the hospital...",
        "Josh: It's not the same thing. Reva'S... still reva. She just has to fight now. That's all. And now that she has us...",
        "Cassie: She's been fighting, and she's been losing.",
        "Josh: But she didn't have us before, and now she does. This is not the same as richard.",
        "Cassie: I was so full of hope, josh. I sat with him day and night. I held his hand. I willed him to come back to me, and I was absolutely convinced that he would. Even after they laid him in the ground, I couldn't let go. You saw me. You were there.",
        "Josh: It's not the same. It's not the same.",
        "Cassie: Sh-sh-sh.",
        "Josh: It's not. Reva can't let go yet. She still has so much she has to do, you know?",
        "Cassie: I know.",
        "Josh: And I can'T... I can't let go of her yet because I have to let her know...",
        "Cassie: Sh-sh-sh. How much you love her.",
        "Billy: Look at you. You are just as pretty as the day you and I got married. I brought a little something special for you. You're going to like this. I... found this. Isn't that something? Your hair's a little shorter, and you're not going for sequins as much, but you're still a looker, girl. And then there's me. I'm a few barbecues heavier, that's for sure. But you know something? I don't feel any different. I guess that's part of it. You know, when I first used to look at you, all I could see was a gold digger. Yeah, little reva snake trying to get my inheritance, my money. And if you woke up right now, you could have it, you know that. Well... hey, remember when I pushed you in the pond there, and I wasn't going to let you get out. It was 'cause I wanted to keep you from my brother. I mean, that's what I told you. But the real reason was I just wanted to see you in wet clothes. You can't blame me now. Or how about the time you were getting... I think it was a prom dress your mom was making for you and you were... yeah, and you were standing on the coffee table in ms. Martha's parlor. And you were all proud and sassy, and I walked up and pulled the hem out of the dress. You got mad and you grabbed that metal log out of the fireplace and chased me around with it. You were so mad and that dress was so ugly. You were desperately beautiful, girl. You... hey, hey, sweetie. Look at you. You know something, I've had this song of ours going around in our head all day long. Remember? Casey jones was a mighty man now he's resting in the... you going to make fun of me now for my singing?",
        "Reva: Keep singing.",
        "Billy: Only kind of music he could understand was an eight wheel driver under his command he made the freight train boogie all the time he made the freight train boogie as he rolled down the line.",
        "Rick: Hey, honey, it's me. Listen, in the event I don't see you before I leave, I would just like you to reconsider that family dinner tonight, okay? I love you.",
        "Beth: So your wife seems to be under the impression that I'm trying to get you back into bed.",
        "Rick: Are you?",
        "Beth: Of course I am.",
        "Jonathan: Are you still here?",
        "Alan: I didn't mean to upset you.",
        "Jonathan: You here to dance on reva's grave?",
        "Alan: I care about your mother.",
        "Jonathan: The hell you do. This is just you weaseling to try and get close to the baby.",
        "Alan: I'm here to see reva.",
        "Jonathan: You hate my mother.",
        "Alan: Look, our relationship is very complicated. But believe it or not, we shared some good times together.",
        "Jonathan: It doesn't matter. You're still not getting anywhere near her.",
        "Alan: Look, I understand your feelings, jonathan. Your daughter is not going to get to know one hell of a grandmother. But that doesn't mean you should deprive her from the rest of her family.",
        "Jonathan: Like you?",
        "Alan: Yes, me, alexandra, and don't forget, elizabeth has an uncle alan- michael. We have a lot to offer her has a family.",
        "Jonathan: No.",
        "Alan: Look, I don't blame you from wanting to keep her away from me. But in time we're going to stop this fighting and start mending fences.",
        "Jonathan: No, it doesn't work like that, alan. Reva's illness only does so much.",
        "Alan: Reva's dying wish would be to...",
        "Jonathan: Her dying wish was to protect my kid from you. Any questions?",
        "Alan: I'm sorry to see her go.",
        "Jonathan: I almost believe you.",
        "Alan: It's the truth, jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Truth? Good. Let me be honest with you for a minute then.",
        "Alan: Honest with me about the fact that you really don't love elizabeth?",
        "Jonathan: That was true, but we're solid now.",
        "Alan: Yeah, solid. But you're in love with tammy.",
        "Jonathan: My baby comes first.",
        "Alan: Really? That's good to hear. What caused this sudden transformation?",
        "Jonathan: You.",
        "Alan: Me?",
        "Jonathan: Mm-hmm. Watching you manipulate lizzie, hurt her in the name of family reminded me of one thing: My old man.",
        "Alan: Mmm, the fisherman, huh?",
        "Jonathan: Rotten bastard ruined my life. I'll be damned if my kid grows up like that.",
        "Alan: Well, it's a nice speech, but rather naive because you'll never be able to stay away from tammy, jonathan. You can go on living this life with elizabeth for one or two years, but then tammy, your kissing cousin, will show up in town and break her heart. Then she'll come running back to me with the baby, where she belongs. Now, I want to talk with reva, so let's go in and see her, huh?",
        "Rick: I love my wife. I love my wife. I love my family, and I want my marriage back.",
        "Beth: And I would never begrudge you.",
        "Rick: This is wrong, beth. It's wrong and it's got to stop. We both know alan is going to retaliate. We both know that.",
        "Beth: What did he say to you?",
        "Rick: Just prepare yourself.",
        "Beth: He's blowing smoke.",
        "Rick: Oh, yeah. Alan never lashes out at anybody, does he, beth?",
        "Beth: You know, I can handle alan, but what I'm worried about is you. You need to be honest with yourself. Maybe you and mel just weren't right for each other from the start.",
        "Rick: That's not up to you, is it?",
        "Beth: I just don't want to see you get hurt.",
        "Rick: You could have fooled me.",
        "Beth: Why does it have to be like this? Come on, rick. We were so happy when we were together.",
        "Rick: Happy? Beth, it wasn't real.",
        "Beth: Bull. It was the most real thing in our lives.",
        "Rick: Is that... is that what you want? You want some loveless marriage and some boyfriend on the side? Is that what you want with your life? Let me ask you something: If philip were to come back tomorrow and ask you to get married, where would that put me?",
        "Beth: This isn't about phillip. And he's not coming back tomorrow. This is about us. You know, I don't know why you're fighting this. I'm the one that gave you comfort. I'm the one that understands you, and, yes, you may love your wife. But who's better for you, honestly, me or mel?",
        "Billy: Good. You know, I just came from a meeting.",
        "Reva: Good.",
        "Billy: I wanted to tell you because I'm responsible for you being here.",
        "Reva: Billy...",
        "Billy: No, it's true. Come on, you had your plans made, and I ruined them. I mean, the only reason you didn't get to leave this earth the way you wanted to because of me, because of my drinking.",
        "Reva: Don't take all the credit. Don't you do that. I made the decision to come back.",
        "Billy: And save my sorry butt. You did. No. Hey, look, I'm through with that stuff, I really am. I'm going to be strong for you.",
        "Reva: You're my rock. I love you, billy lewis. I love you so much.",
        "Billy: I love you, too. You know, I'm wrong. I've been here singing to you and trying to get your memories picked up, just hoping you'll stay here for another minute, another hour, another day just to be beside me, and that's wrong. You're right, sweetie. You don't belong in here with all these tubes in you. It's wrong. I'm not going to do it anymore.",
        "Mel: Hey.",
        "Rick: Hey. Did you get my message?",
        "Mel: Yes, I did, although I'm not sure you're going to be having time for a family dinner when you start your new job.",
        "Rick: New job? What are you talking about?",
        "Mel: Charles hasn't spoken to you yet?",
        "Rick: No.",
        "Mel: He wants to set up that free clinic down in clayton.",
        "Rick: Alan'S.",
        "Mel: Alan-- what are you talking about, honey?",
        "Rick: Nothing, honey, it's nothing. Forget it. It doesn't matter.",
        "Mel: Oh, yes, I understand. He wants you to stay away from his wife. Good luck with that one.",
        "Beth: Hey, congratulations.",
        "Rick: About what? Clayton? I'm not going to clayton, that's an hour away, and I'm never going to see my wife. I'm not taking that job.",
        "Beth: Oh, come on. When duty calls, and you're so perfect for it. Okay. I wasn't going to say anything, but say hello to your new boss.",
        "Rick: You set this up?",
        "Beth: Alan's not the only one with persuasion. So I will see you bright and early on monday morning.",
        "Jonathan: Stay away from my wife and kid, you got it? You don't call, you don't write. My daughter is going to think that spaulding is a name on a big white mailbox on the hill, okay?",
        "Alan: You'll never get away with that.",
        "Jonathan: We'll see.",
        "Billy: When I thought you were gone for good, I fell apart. I didn't think I could make it without you. I picked up a drink, and then another one. Soon you were there. You came back. It was like every second from then on has been a gift. It's kind of like a bonus. It wasn't supposed to happen. Sweetie, what I'm trying to say is I'm going to be okay. I'm going to go on living just like you want me to. I'm going to miss you like holy hell, but I'm going to be okay. So... if you're tired, I will stay here and hold your hand all the way. Right to the end. I'll even hold it a little afterwards, too. You don't have to stay here for me or josh or cassie or anybody. We're all going to are okay. We'll be okay. I'm tired of seeing you hurt, girl. So if it's your time, it's okay to let go, reva. It's okay to let go.",
        "Josh: You get the hell away from her!",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Josh: I can't just let him give you permission to check out on us, reva. You can beat this thing.",
        "Reva: I'm ready.",
        "Olivia: Is that for reva?",
        "Buzz: It's not much.",
        "Billy: It wasn't supposed to end like this. Not in a hospital."
