        "(First half of show was preempted for President Bush's speech.)",
        "Sandy: That's it. No more game for me. I can't handle any more questions.",
        "Reva: Then just answer the big one. Why? Why did you come into my life and let me love you?",
        "Sandy: I never planned on pretending to be your son. I came to town to meet you and tell you about Jonathan, and I found myself wanting to be a part of your family. And when you walked in and jumped to the conclusion I was Jonathan, I thought, what the hell, I could be a better son than he ever would.",
        "Reva: What about your own parents?",
        "Sandy: I never really knew them. I was shuttled from boarding school to boarding school. They were big on travel, not so big on me.",
        "Reva: You still had parents. So, who was looking after you?",
        "Sandy: Well, let's see. There was Mr. Davis, the computer teacher. He always had an extra spot at his table around Christmas time. And Mrs. Johanssen, the cook. She got stuck with me at Easter. Most of the time, I just spent on campus by my ... you know what? I don't want to do this.",
        "Reva: Then don't. But stop looking at me with those big, sad eyes and expecting me to forgive you.",
        "Sandy: I don't expect that. There's no excuse for what I did.",
        "Reva: You're damn right there's no excuse. And if what you say about your childhood is true, then I shouldn't blame you, but I do. I blame you for sucking me in, for making me love you like a real son, for allowing yourself to become a part of my family, because you didn't just hurt me. You hurt Marah and Shayne and Josh and Tammy.",
        "Sandy: I know. And I'm sorry. And you have every right to hate my guts.",
        "Reva: Oh, please. Don't. Stop being so noble, you know? Make excuses, you know. Be a jerk. It would make this all so much easier.",
        "Sandy: All right, I'll make it a lot easier for you. I'll leave. As soon as I figure out where I'm going, I'll never bother you or anyone else in your family again.",
        "Reva: Oh, that's just great. Thank you. Thank you so much. Just wash your hands of this whole mess and leave me here to deal with my real kid, the kid that I can barely even stand to look at, a kid that I don't know whether I'll ever be able to love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: You know, those charges aren't going to stick. I'm going to be out of here by tonight.",
        "Josh: I don't doubt that for a minute.",
        "Jonathan: So, what the hell is this?",
        "Josh: Oh, this is nothing. This is just a warning.",
        "Billy: You know, boy, you don't know nothing about the Lewis's. I mean, what did you think, you could step on one of us and there wasn't going to be any retribution? Hey, nobody gets away with it.",
        "Jonathan: So, what's the game plan?",
        "Josh: Well, it must be obvious to you by now I could do pretty much anything I want in this town. Tonight, small thing, you're right. A wallet, misdemeanor, no big deal. But tomorrow? Tomorrow, it will be a felony. You see, here's the thing: No one has more credibility in this town than me. No one has less credibility than you. Now, I can pull a few strings and you can spend the rest of your miserable life in prison, which is where you belong. But I'm not going to do that. I'm going to give you a chance. Billy? Take off the cuffs.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Okay, Phillip is crazier than a three-dollar bill. He's acting like he killed you or something.",
        "Harley: He tried.",
        "Bill: What?",
        "Harley: Oh, yeah. I was just in the alley over by J. Farley's bar and a car came out of nowhere and almost took me out. If Gus hadn't pushed me out of the way, you would have had to peel me off the ground like a wad of gum.",
        "Bill: Wait a minute. Did you see him? Was Phillip driving the car?",
        "Harley: No, no, no. All I saw was some guy wearing a skeleton mask.",
        "Bill: I think it's time for Ruth to retire to Florida, okay? This is getting ...",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Bill: Yeah, you're getting in over your head.",
        "Harley: No. Bill, seriously, we are so close.",
        "Bill: He's going to come after you again. You know that.",
        "Harley: That's what I'm counting on.",
        "Bill: I knew you were going to say that.",
        "Harley: We've got to put the pressure on. We've got to tighten the screws.",
        "Bill: All right. Well, what have you got in mind?",
        "Harley: I think it's time for Ruth to have a little meltdown right about now. Watch out. (Snaps fingers) I need to speak to you alone. This minute, please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Daddy, uh ...",
        "Phillip: Not now, honey.",
        "Lizzie: Can we go?",
        "Phillip: Ruth, what are you still doing here?",
        "Ruth: I'm waiting for an answer on my offer, sir. You know, I might find myself going into a bar to have a couple of drinks. I don't usually do that; it tends to make me a bit chatty.",
        "Phillip: Ruth, you are in so far over your head.",
        "Ruth: Oh, I'm not afraid, sir. I know that you sent Mr. Aitoro to get me out of town, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm here to stay and I will get what I want.",
        "Phillip: I find that highly unlikely, Ruth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Are you okay?",
        "Reva: You know, it was right over there where I held you in my arms after your accident. I was scared to death that I was going to lose you and all I could think about was all the time that we weren't going to have to spend together, and now I feel like I'm losing you all over again. You're not even my son, but I have this incredible feeling of loss.",
        "Sandy: So do I.",
        "Reva: A part of me wishes I could go back to that moment when I had you in my arms, when I was just this woman who didn't know. You know, stupid and happy? Because I don't know you. I don't even know who you are, sandy. Who are you?",
        "Sandy: It doesn't even matter.",
        "Reva: Right. God! You know, that kid was in my house tonight and when I looked at him, after knowing what he did to Tammy--I don't even know why I'm telling you this-- I invited him to dinner. (Laughs)",
        "Sandy: The old family sit-down thing. That always works well.",
        "Reva: You think I'd learn my lesson.",
        "Sandy: Well, warm and fuzzy doesn't really work for Jonathan unless he can kill it.",
        "Reva: I know. I mean, I know he had this terrible childhood and all, but it doesn't excuse what he did. I mean, I'm sure it was a nightmare but there was a moment tonight when I really thought, \"I wish he would just go away,\" you know? I'm his mother and I'm supposed to love him but I really want him to just go away. What's wrong with me? (Sobs)",
        "Josh: I'll keep it simple, okay? You either leave town immediately or something very, very bad will happen.",
        "Jonathan: I'm sorry, Clint. I don't think you're capable of doing much more than planting wallets.",
        "Josh: What about him?",
        "Jonathan: What about him?",
        "Josh: Billy?",
        "Billy: I'll make sure you don't even see it coming, just like Tammy didn't see it coming.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, well, him I believe, but it doesn't mean I'm going anywhere.",
        "Billy: That's too bad.",
        "Jonathan: (Groans)",
        "Billy: You made it down to the floor. Here's Billy!",
        "Jonathan: Get him off ... get him off of me.",
        "Josh: You know, I'd love to help you, but unfortunately, I can't really control my brother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: Ruth, you have worked for me. You know the ramifications of crossing my family. You know that there is nothing that we won't do to protect our loved ones.",
        "Ruth: Oh, dear, sir. You have no moral conscience. I believe you have tumbled over the edge.",
        "Phillip: Ruth, I won't be the one tumbling over the edge tonight. See, I don't let my problems pile up anymore. I deal with my anxieties. I've learned how to solve them in the moment and I get rid of them.",
        "Ruth: (Gasps)",
        "Orderly #1: Come with us, Mr. Spaulding.",
        "Phillip: What? Come with you? Who are you?",
        "Orderly #2: We've been sent by the doctor. This way.",
        "Phillip: Whoa. What doctor? Who are you working for?",
        "Orderly #2: We'll explain everything on the way.",
        "Phillip: Get off of me.",
        "Orderly #?: Let's go! (Struggling)",
        "Phillip: What is that? No! No! No! No! Security! Security! I need help!",
        "Lizzie: (Screams)",
        "Phillip: Lizzie, call the police! Call the police!",
        "Lizzie: Stop it! Let go of my dad! What are you doing? (Struggling)",
        "Orderly #2: Mr. Spaulding is going back to Ravenwood.",
        "Phillip: Oh, no! No! No!",
        "Lizzie: Stop it!",
        "Phillip: Please, no!",
        "Lizzie: Stop it! Daddy!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Gee, you know, Jonathan, I don't want to rush you into a decision here, but what's it going to be?",
        "Jonathan: All right. Get him off me and then we can talk.",
        "Josh: What is it going to be?",
        "Jonathan: All right, whatever. Just get him off of me. Get him off of me.",
        "Josh: Okay, Billy. I think you're going to need to leave us alone for just a minute.",
        "Billy: You sure it's a good idea?",
        "Josh: Yeah, it'll be fine.",
        "Jonathan: What's that?",
        "Josh: Blood money. That's your inheritance from Richard.",
        "Jonathan: (Scoffs) I always wondered if he left me something. Thank you. I've been a little busy to pick it up.",
        "Josh: Jonathan, you've seen what can happen here. You can stick around here in town and I can make your life miserable or you can take the money, you can go and your life will be rich, very rich. I don't see what there is to think about.",
        "Jonathan: My family is here. My mother.",
        "Josh: You don't even like Reva. You've made it clear you don't want her to be your mother. So what's the big deal, huh? You claim that everybody in this town has hurt you and yet you stick around. If it were me, I would take the money, I would go and never, never come back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I should feel something.",
        "Sandy: If it were anyone else, I would probably agree with you. But what you've seen of Jonathan is just the start. It can get worse.",
        "Reva: He delights in pushing my buttons and when he was there tonight, I couldn't help but feel like ...",
        "Sandy: Feel like what?",
        "Reva: Like I was being disloyal to you.",
        "Sandy: Why don't we play another game?",
        "Reva: I don't have any more questions.",
        "Sandy: I don't have any more answers. Why don't you rack them up, hmm? Please? I'll be right in, in a minute. Hi. Don't hang up. This is Sandy.",
        "Josh: What do you want?",
        "Sandy: It's about Reva. She needs you.",
        "Josh: Where?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: They'll take good care of him, though. And perhaps this might even be good for him. At least it'll keep him from knocking other peoples' homes down. Lizzie, I think you should even look at this as perhaps maybe a little vacation. What do you think?",
        "Lizzie: Don't touch me! Just get away.",
        "Ruth: All right. It's all right, dear. Come with me. Come with me, dear.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Hey. You just missed all the fun. Phillip was taken away by the men in white coats.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, I know. I sent them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: I'm sorry it had to be this way, buddy, but you and I have to talk.",
        "Ruth: Oh, Lizzie, dear. Dear, dear. This must all be very, very difficult for you.",
        "Lizzie: Difficult? I'm going to end up just like my dad, Ruth. I know it. I can just see it.",
        "Ruth: Your father kept everything inside. That is why he's in the trouble he's in now, dear. You have to let it out. You have to talk to someone.",
        "Lizzie: You're right. I've got to tell someone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: You didn't tell me about Ruth. Once again, you and Harley kept me out of the loop! No. No. I could go to jail and lose Emma.",
        "Bill: Listen to me. We are going to turn this thing around. Phillip is locked up now.",
        "Olivia: For how long? How long? He could get out tomorrow and take Emma away from me. Do you really think Rick is going to have him committed?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: You going to have me committed, pal? Against my will? Is that what you think you're going to do? No, I don't think so, Rick. Let me see the papers.",
        "Rick: There's no papers.",
        "Phillip: Give me the papers.",
        "Rick: There's no papers, Phillip. You just sit down and relax so we can talk about this.",
        "Phillip: Oh, you think you're going to drag me away against my will, in front of my daughter, and I'm going to sit down and relax?",
        "Rick: I'm very worried about you, Phillip. I just need to find out if what everybody else is saying in this town is true, that's all.",
        "Phillip: What? Oh, what, Rick? That I'm a psychopath?",
        "Rick: Stop it, okay? It doesn't have to be this way. Let's just sit down and talk.",
        "Phillip: And you'll do what, Rick? Get me back to my old normal self? Well, gee, that sounds swell, but we're well past that, don't you think? Don't you think? Don't even you realize that we've gone a little too far for that?",
        "Rick: What has gone too far? Phillip, we have been through some real tough times in the past and we've always made it out the other side. Always. There's nothing that you and I can't talk about.",
        "Phillip: Well, if you felt that way, Rick, why did you send the guys with the butterfly nets? Why didn't you just call me and say ...",
        "Rick: Call you? I have called you and called you and called you and you haven't called me back, Phillip. I'm just very concerned about you. A lot of people are.",
        "Phillip: A lot of people are. Hm. Okay. Ah, I think I see what happened. They got to you, didn't they, Rick? They finally got to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: I am not going to let Phillip get to you or Emma.",
        "Olivia: Stop it. Just get away from me.",
        "Bill: Look, what is wrong?",
        "Olivia: I thought you were different.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ruth: People appreciate the truth, especially the police. Why don't we go see them?",
        "Lizzie: I don't know. My dad ...",
        "Ruth: Your father made his decision. Now you need to make yours, dear.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Hi, there. (Sighs) what are you doing tonight?",
        "Reva: I don't know. What have you got in mind?",
        "Josh: That depends. You married?",
        "Reva: To a wonderful man. But he's great at sharing.",
        "Josh: (Chuckles) sounds like I might get lucky tonight.",
        "Reva: I think I'm the lucky one. What are you doing here?",
        "Josh: Sandy called me. He told me you needed some cheering up. And after that wonderful dinner, I can't really understand why.",
        "Reva: Jonathan is ... whatever. I just can't believe he's mine.",
        "Josh: You don't have to worry. It's over now.",
        "Reva: What do you mean, it's over?",
        "Josh: Jonathan is never going to hurt you again. (Cell phone rings)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Hello? Tammy? I ... Tammy? You're cutting out, Tammy. What's wrong. Tammy? Tammy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: (Laughs) hey, aunt Olivia. Aunt Olivia, listen. I need a ... I need a ... (rings bell) I need a suite of rooms. Me and my friends want to celebrate.",
        "Olivia: You've got a room to sleep in. You can celebrate someplace else.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, I'm not looking for any freebies, okay? I got my trust fund today. So I'm good for it. I'm good for the room. I'm good for the whole hotel. I could buy the frigging world if I wanted to.",
        "Olivia: Why don't you do that? Go buy a planet and party somewhere else, okay?",
        "Bill: All right, listen. I didn't tell you about Ruth, okay, and that is a bad idea on the surface, I know, but some day....",
        "Olivia: Some day may not come because I'll be in jail. You kept secrets from me.",
        "Bill: I know I did and I am sorry. I am. But you've got to let it go. You've got to trust me, all right? Because whether you like it or not, we are all in this together-- you, me, Harley and anyone who Phillip thinks is against him. And I think he's... I think he's losing it. I think he's pulling out all the stops here. And if we don't all work together on this, I think somebody might get killed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: You really think that I'm against you?",
        "Phillip: What should I think?",
        "Rick: I want what's best for you.",
        "Phillip: Well, you know, Rick, it's getting harder and harder to believe that.",
        "Rick: I'm on your side. I've always been on your side. I've always had your back, you've always had mine. There's no reason why we can't do that again.",
        "Phillip: I don't think so, Rick. Because, see, you're too easily swayed. Because you always want to be the good guy, the one who listens, the one that everybody likes. And you know, there's a price that you pay for that, and I don't intend to pay it. I'm not going back to that hospital.",
        "Rick: Okay. Fine.",
        "Phillip: I know what everybody is saying around here. I know they all want me locked up so I'm out of the way, so they can go after my family.",
        "Rick: It's not true.",
        "Phillip: Yes, it is. Who ... who got to you?",
        "Rick: Not everyone is against you, Phillip.",
        "Phillip: You didn't answer my question.",
        "Rick: But you just answered mine.",
        "Phillip: Oh, so what, are they going to come back and take me away now?",
        "Rick: No, not this time.",
        "Phillip: Not this time.",
        "Rick: No.",
        "Phillip: What does that mean?",
        "Rick: Phillip, it means that I am not giving up on you. It means I want you to find some peace in your life and be happy. That's what it means.",
        "Phillip: Don't I look happy to you? You already gave up on me, Rick. You know, when all the other ones turned on me, I wasn't really all that surprised, but I ... are we done here?",
        "Rick: This time.",
        "Phillip: Take care, pal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Well, hello, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Hi. Um ... this is Ruth Karloff.",
        "Frank: Ruth?",
        "Ruth: Mm-hmm.",
        "Frank: What's up?",
        "Lizzie: There's something I need to tell you. It's about Sandy Foster's hit and run.",
        "Frank: Well, what about it?",
        "Ruth: Yes, you can. You can do it. Go ahead.",
        "Lizzie: I know who the driver was.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zach: Daddy?",
        "Phillip: Come here. Buddy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. You okay?",
        "Zach: You're mad.",
        "Phillip: Yeah, but not at you.",
        "Zach: I know. You're mad at mommy.",
        "Phillip: No. No. It's my secretary Ruth.",
        "Zach: Daddy, Ruth is mommy."
