        "Billy: You don't have to stay around for old Billy or Josh or Cassie. We're all going to be fine. We'll be fine. I hate seeing you hurt so bad. Sweetie, if it's your time, it's okay. It's okay, Reva. You can let go. You can let go.",
        "Josh: You get the hell away from her!",
        "Billy: Josh, I'm trying to help!",
        "Josh: Oh, really? You're trying to help, Billy? By talking her into quitting, giving up, dying? Is that what you're doing? Because that's not your call.",
        "Billy: Josh, it's her time.",
        "Josh: No, it's not her time. It's not her time. Not if I have to take her breaths for her, she is not going anywhere.",
        "Billy: You think you can do anything, you think you can save her...",
        "Josh: Maybe I can. Maybe I can. Get the hell out of here. Get out of here!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Is that for Reva?",
        "Buzz: Yeah, it's not much, but it's something. I don't know... I can't get my brain around it. I can't believe that Reva, who's you know, had so many wild times, just...",
        "Olivia: I know. I mean, I think I've hated her most of the time, but I can't imagine a world without her in it.",
        "Buzz: It kind of makes you think.",
        "Olivia: You never know.",
        "Buzz: You never know. Life is so fragile, the candle can go out like... ...a whisper. We can't waste time fighting and holding grudges.",
        "Olivia: You want to go to the hospital?",
        "Buzz: I wasn't talking about the Lewis'.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: You stay away from my wife. Are you listening to me? Listen to me. My daughter is going to think that Spaulding is just a name on a big white mailbox on a hill. You got it?",
        "Alan: You will never get away with that.",
        "Jonathan: We'll see, won't we?",
        "Lizzie: What's going on?",
        "Alan: Reva is very ill, and I thought I would reach out to your husband. After all, it's times like these that bring families together, Lizzie.",
        "Jonathan: He's just trying to get close to the baby.",
        "Alan: I'm here to see Reva.",
        "Jonathan: You're using my dying mother to worm your way into our family? She doesn't want you here.",
        "Alan: I didn't hear her say that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Hey, hey! You think I want her to die?",
        "Josh: I don't care about what you want, Billy.",
        "Billy: What about what Reva wants?",
        "Josh: I'm trying to get her to fight.",
        "Billy: But we've been fighting... she's been fighting real hard.",
        "Josh: Yeah, fine, well, why give up now then? Because that wouldn't be Reva, would it?",
        "Cassie: Josh, Billy is...",
        "Josh: She's not going to die, Billy.",
        "Billy: That's what I said after the chemo, after the stem cell...",
        "Josh: She's not ready to let go! (Monitor beeping)",
        "Billy: Nurse, nurse!",
        "Cassie: Is there a doctor here?",
        "Billy: We need help here!",
        "Josh: Reva, what are you doing? Reva... Reva! (Monitor beeping) Reva! Stay with us, Reva. Hang in there. Nurse, nurse!",
        "Cassie: I'm going to get someone.",
        "Lillian: Out of the way. Out of the way.",
        "Josh: Okay, okay. What happened? What went wrong here? What's the problem?",
        "Lillian: Well, the alarm went off because she pulled her electrodes out. Now, why would she do that?",
        "Cassie: I wonder if your fighting had anything to do with it.",
        "Lillian: Fighting? Get out of here right now.",
        "Billy: No, I'm staying.",
        "Josh: No, I have to stay here, too, Lillian.",
        "Cassie: Josh, look, you don't.",
        "Josh: No, Cassie, listen, I have to.",
        "Reva: Let Joshua stay.",
        "Josh: Reva...",
        "Reva: We need to talk.",
        "Lillian: Now? All right, everybody, out. Come on.",
        "Josh: Just don't you let go.",
        "Reva: I may have to.",
        "Josh: No, Reva, you don't have to.",
        "Reva: Joshua, you and Billy, no fighting.",
        "Josh: Look, I'm sorry we argued, okay? But I can't just let him give you permission to check out on us, Reva. You can beat this thing. We'll get some other doctors in here, the best in the world. We'll get... we'll get cutting- edge researchers. We'll test and retest until we find the answer. If you need another bone marrow transplant, that's what we'll do, okay?",
        "Reva: No. No, I signed a DNR.",
        "Josh: We're not going to need that, not if you hang on.",
        "Reva: It's my time. I'm ready. I was ready that night.",
        "Josh: What are you talking about, what night?",
        "Reva: My party.",
        "Josh: You're going-away party?",
        "Reva: I was going away... forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: I just can't stop thinking about my mom, when she was dying, you know, the kind of person that she was.",
        "Buzz: We're going to Cedars.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, we're just going to support Josh and Reva and the rest of the family.",
        "Coop: That's great. Do you think they want you there?",
        "Buzz: I don't think this is the time for grudges.",
        "Ava: We're coming with you.",
        "Olivia: I'll take this, okay?",
        "Ava: No, it's okay. It's fine.",
        "Olivia: It's heavy. It's heavy.",
        "Ava: Right, it's heavy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: How are you feeling today? You ready for some pictures?",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, here's some imported water. It is much, much better for you. Now, you don't really think that I would use a tragedy like this, do you?",
        "Jonathan: She knows that you would. She knows you would. We have to take a sonogram today. I don't want my kid flipping head over heels, okay? So we'll just see you later.",
        "Alan: Jonathan banned me from your life, Elizabeth. Did he tell you that? Is that what you want? To never see your granddad or your family again?",
        "Jonathan: Only if she's lucky.",
        "Lizzie: Did you know I idolized you? When I was little, you were the only person that treated me like a grown up. When I grew up, I actually... I wanted to grow up and be just like you. And I did grow up. But then, I guess, I figured out what my dad and Alan-Michael and the rest of the world already knew about you.",
        "Alan: Don't listen to them. You know how I feel about you.",
        "Lizzie: No, I thought that I did. And then you came after me and my baby.",
        "Alan: Only to protect you.",
        "Lizzie: I don't know. Even after everything that has happened, I look at Reva and I feel my daughter kick... be my granddad, then maybe we'll have something.",
        "Alan: You mean that?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah.",
        "Alan: That's all I ever wanted, was to be close to you again and to be a part of your daughter's life.",
        "Jonathan: How can you trust him?",
        "Alan: I can say the same thing about you.",
        "Lizzie: Jonathan's proved himself. He has given up Tammy for me, for my baby. He is my husband and I love him. We should go, we don't want to be late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: You're still here?",
        "Josh: Yes, I am. I want to know what you meant before, about your going away party.",
        "Reva: It was good-bye.",
        "Josh: But how could you possibly know that, Reva? How could you know that that was the end, unless...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: She was all set. She was driving off, and I brought her back again.",
        "Cassie: Driving off? She was driving off where?",
        "Billy: Oh, never mind.",
        "Cassie: Billy, what... my God, what are you saying? Are you saying that the party...",
        "Billy: Just leave it be, okay?",
        "Cassie: She meant to die that night? She was going to drive off... she was going to drive off to God knows where and... oh, my God. Only you fell off the wagon because you knew. And she came back.",
        "Billy: Yeah. She came back for me.",
        "Cassie: My God, Billy.",
        "Billy: I'm so sorry. I am so, so sorry.",
        "Cassie: You were going to help my sister die?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: So that red sports car that was parked out front...",
        "Reva: My color, red.",
        "Josh: So that wasn't going to be used for some big old road trip you were going to go on, huh? That was going to end up being your...",
        "Reva: Hell of a coffin, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I should hit you right now. My sister wanted to take her own life and you were going to help her.",
        "Billy: Yeah. I gave her the keys.",
        "Cassie: I love you, Billy. Thank you for everything you did for her.",
        "Billy: I didn't do anything.",
        "Cassie: You did everything. I just hope Josh and I have half your courage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: You had no right, Reva. You were going to take your own life? You had no right to keep this from me and keep it from Cassie, and keep it from the kids and from everybody in town, who would have been here for you, who would have helped you to get well. You were going to leave without so much as saying good-bye, Reva? How long have we known each other? How long, Reva?",
        "Reva: A lifetime.",
        "Josh: Yeah, that's right, a lifetime. I have loved you since I was a boy. And you said... you said you loved me, too.",
        "Reva: And I do.",
        "Josh: Yeah, well now you're going to have to prove it to me, Reva. You're going to get on these damn feet of yours and you're going to walk out that door and you're going to prove your love for me. And if you think for one second that I'm going to sit here and I'm going to applaud you and kiss you on the cheek and send you off gently into the night, you got another thing coming because that is not going to happen. You're going to live, Reva. Do you understand me? You are going to live if it's the last thing you do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Why are you following us, Granddad?",
        "Alan: Well, Elizabeth, I just wanted to go in and see a picture of your daughter, that's all.",
        "Jonathan: Enough. Leave my wife and my mother alone. Are you getting the point or do I have to drive it home?",
        "Alan: Ah, the famous Randall temper. I can't wait to see how you react when you have to pacify a crying baby.",
        "Lizzie: Just go, okay?",
        "Alan: All right, Elizabeth, we'll do this your way.",
        "Jonathan: We're late, let's go.",
        "Alan: Wait a minute. Jonathan, I think it would be best if you went to be with your mother right now, and I'll be happy to take Elizabeth into her doctor's appointment.",
        "Jonathan: Don't tell me what to do. The best thing I can do for my mother right now is make sure my daughter is okay.",
        "Lizzie: Bye, Granddad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Oh, what's all this?",
        "Buzz: It's fortifications. How's Reva?",
        "Cassie: She's hanging in there.",
        "Coop: I'm so sorry.",
        "Cassie: Thanks.",
        "Olivia: You know, if you don't want all of us hanging around, we can...",
        "Ava: Or some of us...",
        "Cassie: Oh, no. We can use all of the positive energy we can muster.",
        "Billy: Hey, the food's... the food's really great. Thanks.",
        "Olivia: Ava's idea. We just came along for the ride.",
        "Billy: Well, thank you very much.",
        "Ava: Well, Reva's always been such a good friend to me, and I know what she means to all of us, so...",
        "Buzz: Can I go in?",
        "Billy: I'm sure she'd love to see you, but Josh is in there right now.",
        "Buzz: Well, when you get the chance-- if you get the chance-- to just tell her I was here and praying for her.",
        "Cassie: Thanks, we'll do that.",
        "Buzz: How are you holding up?",
        "Cassie: Oh, I'm okay. I'm just... I can't help... you know, wishing I called more, taken more pictures or written more letters.",
        "Buzz: There's time, right?",
        "Cassie: I just feel like when all of this is over, she's going to have me over, pour me a cup of coffee, and I'm going to tell her how crazy this was, and... (crying)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: You didn't have to do that.",
        "Olivia: Do what?",
        "Ava: Give me credit for bringing the food.",
        "Olivia: Just scoring points with Buzz. You know me.",
        "Ava: Sure.",
        "Olivia: Let's not fight. Not today, okay?",
        "Ava: Okay. Whatever you say.",
        "Olivia: We're all going to end up in a room like that one day. If we're lucky, we'll have someone by our side who loves us. If we're blessed, there will be a lot of people.",
        "Ava: I thought you hated Reva.",
        "Olivia: Me, too.",
        "Ava: You don't?",
        "Olivia: You wouldn't understand.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: I refuse to accept that this is the end.",
        "Reva: Not the end. Not for us.",
        "Josh: Okay, you know what, you've got to stop talking now because you have to save your strength, all right? You got to save your strength so you can pull through.",
        "Reva: Always, that's us.",
        "Josh: Reva, just stop talking, okay?",
        "Reva: Always connected in this life and... in the next life by our children, my memories... so many memories. Remember, Bud?",
        "Josh: Yes, I know.",
        "Reva: Tell me...",
        "Josh: There will be a lot of other memories. Tell you what?",
        "Reva: Remember with me.",
        "Josh: No, I'm not going to do that.",
        "Reva: Joshua.",
        "Josh: No.",
        "Reva: Please?",
        "Josh: Okay. The first thing I see is the lake at Cross Creek. You on the boat. The sun is hitting your hair like a flame",
        "Reva: The lake.",
        "Josh: And you're in your wedding dress like an angel.",
        "Reva: Now, it's time to hear you say the words I need you to say, Bud.",
        "Josh: What words?",
        "Reva: It's time. It's time to say good-bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: This is really taking a long time. You should go be with Reva.",
        "Jonathan: No. I want to see the sonogram.",
        "Lizzie: It can be your last time, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Reva and I already said our good-byes, so, you know, if it's gonna happen, this is where I should be. I should be with her grandchild, you know? Warding off the curse of the Spaulding people.",
        "Lizzie: Please don't say that.",
        "Jonathan: What?",
        "Lizzie: The curse thing. I wasn't going to say anything, but she hasn't moved in a while.",
        "Jonathan: Well, even Shakira's got to rest every now and then.",
        "Lizzie: It has been a really long time, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Look, I don't have Reva's faith. I don't really believe in much of anything. But I do believe that this baby is meant to be.",
        "Lizzie: Wow! I like to hear you say that.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Come on. You think our old girl is gonna want to miss out on all those free motorcycle rides and shopping trips and days at the spa? She'd have to be stupid. Come on, little girl, get a move on. You're freaking your mama... baby mama. Come on.",
        "Lizzie: You've lost your mind. (Laughing)",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Well, this is what I like to see, a couple of happy parents. Are you ready to take another look at your baby?",
        "Jonathan: Fire up that sonogram machine. We're old pros at this.",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Oh, today is going to be different.",
        "Lizzie: Really, how?",
        "Dr. Sedwick: We're going to use 3-D imaging and you're going to see your baby as you have never seen her before.",
        "Lizzie: It's not dangerous or anything, right?",
        "Dr. Sedwick: The only danger is that you might fall even more in love with her.",
        "Jonathan: Do we have to use special glasses?",
        "Dr. Sedwick: No, that's not necessary.",
        "Jonathan: Okay.",
        "Lizzie: I just hope that she's okay.",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Well, we shall see in a minute.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Come on now, you got to stay hydrated.",
        "Reva: No water.",
        "Josh: Just take a sip, Reva. Come on.",
        "Reva: No.",
        "Josh: Don't look at me like that. I'm not going to say good-bye. You should know better than to ask me to do something like that, Reva. In fact, you know something? I think that's the reason you didn't tell me about the cancer. Because you knew if you did that, I would be with you and I'd be on your case 24/7 until you got better. I'm right, aren't I? Just take a sip of water, okay?",
        "Reva: No.",
        "Josh: I'm going to call somebody.",
        "Reva: No! Nobody.",
        "Josh: Reva, you need some more pain medication...",
        "Reva: I want to be aware. It's okay.",
        "Josh: I'm just really scared of losing you.",
        "Reva: You, scared? Never.",
        "Josh: Aren't you?",
        "Reva: Sure. We'll be together again.",
        "Josh: Reva...",
        "Reva: With H.B. and Mama.",
        "Josh: Don't say that.",
        "Reva: You know, I seen her in a dream. She's on a ship, and she reaches out for me, but she's still too far away.",
        "Josh: Don't reach back.",
        "Reva: She's coming.",
        "Josh: It's okay. It's okay.",
        "Reva: Oh!",
        "Josh: Okay. I don't want to be strong, but I will be. I don't want to let you go, but I will. I don't want to turn this into something good, but I promise-- I swear to you-- I'll take care of our children. They will never want for anything. And that even includes Jonathan, okay?",
        "Reva: And the baby.",
        "Josh: And his baby, yes. And I'll never forget the woman who loved them so much, and left them such an incredible legacy, I swear you.",
        "Reva: One last thing...",
        "Josh: Anything.",
        "Reva: Let Cassie take care of you. I can rest if I know that you're loved.",
        "Josh: Whatever I am, whatever good I've done, it's been because of loving you. Every joy and every heartbreak, every day that we fought like cats and dogs and every night we made up... it's okay. I can't imagine a world without you in it, Reva. I don't want to live in that world. But I can't ask you to fight and hang on anymore when I see you in so much pain. Please, don't ask me to walk away. Let me sit with you until... until...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Reva? What is it?",
        "Reva: Josh is... is so tired. He'd never admit it.",
        "Cassie: I know. He thinks he can fix anything.",
        "Reva: Yeah. Anything. But me. He needs someone to fix him. You, Cassie. You need to be good to him. Take care of him.",
        "Cassie: I will.",
        "Josh: Reva?",
        "Billy: Well?",
        "Lillian: It won't be long now. I'm going to be right out there if she needs me.",

        "Buzz: Somebody better call Jonathan.",
        "Olivia: I'll go.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I just hope we see her move.",
        "Jonathan: If she doesn't move, I'll poke her. She's a half Spaulding, half Shayne, a little punk rocker in there. She ain't going to quit.",
        "Lizzie: You really should be with Reva.",
        "Jonathan: I'll go as soon as I have a picture of the baby to show her.",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Pay attention, you two, you're missing the show.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, awesome. That's real?",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Yes, yes, she's real.",
        "Lizzie: How does she look?",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Oh, in perfect condition.",
        "Jonathan: So nothing's wrong?",
        "Dr. Sedwick: No, nothing at all. Oh, did you see that?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, what is that? Is she in pain?",
        "Dr. Sedwick: This is the baby's REM state. She's dreaming. She certainly looks content.",
        "Lizzie: She will be.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, yeah, no nightmares for my girl.",

        "Josh: She was in pain before. Can you give her something?",
        "Doctor: Well, we can, but...",
        "Josh: But what?",
        "Doctor: If we do, that will probably be it. We can wait, see how it goes.",
        "Josh: Yeah, let's do that, thank you. I've spent a lot of time with Reva, I know that. I'm sorry.",
        "Cassie: Josh, you don't have to explain.",
        "Josh: I just... I had had to talk to her. You know, I mean, I thought that maybe because I'm here, she'd have a chance to pull through. She's left us before, you know, and each time she has come back.",
        "Cassie: So why should this be any different?",
        "Josh: Yeah. So I gave it my best shot. I tried everything I could. I don't think she's coming back this time.",
        "Cassie: Billy told me she was ready to die the night of the party. I think the only reason she held on is because she knew we would kill ourselves if she says good- bye.",
        "Josh: She asked me to say good-bye.",
        "Cassie: Did you?",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Lillian: Josh, she wants you. All of you.",

        "Coop: I can handle things here if you want to go ahead and take the rest of the night off.",
        "Buzz: No, I've got to stay busy.",
        "Alan: Better listen to your son, Buzz. You're not as young as you used to be.",
        "Buzz: You know what you look like? You look like a buzzard in a black suit waiting for something to die so you can eat it.",
        "Alan: How do you know I'm not just upset about Reva? We used to be close, you know? I was in love with her.",
        "Buzz: Oh, I can see you're all broken up about that.",
        "Alan: At least I don't wear my feelings on my sleeves, Buzz.",
        "Buzz: You know, you are in here drinking alone, not because Reva's dying, but because Lizzie's daughter is living with no need for you. Oh no, don't pay. It's on the house.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: I need to tell Jonathan that his mother needs him.",
        "Ava: Don't worry about it, I'll take care of it. Why don't you just go hover over Buzz.",
        "Olivia: Don't do this. This isn't about me, it's about him, all right?",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Ladies, ladies, keep it down out here.",
        "Olivia: I need to see Jonathan, please.",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Oh, please, don't disturb him now. It's not every day a man gets to meet his child.",
        "Olivia: Meet his... (laughing)",
        "Jonathan: This little girl is not ever going to get to meet Reva.",
        "Lizzie: I'm so sorry, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Thank you. It's okay. I just feel bad for her, you know? She's missing out and she's not even born yet. Reva is... well, Reva.",
        "Lizzie: There's nobody like her.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. I promise you one thing-- yeah, I'm talking to you, little Randall-- I promise you I will never let you forget her. Ever, never, ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I thought that it would hurt, but there's no pain, just light... the brightest light.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Look, it looks like she's smiling.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Peaceful. So still.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: She kicked. Did you see that?",
        "Lizzie: (Laughing) I felt it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: So blessed. I love you, all of you, so much. The kids... I feel them here.",
        "Josh: We love you, too, Reva.",
