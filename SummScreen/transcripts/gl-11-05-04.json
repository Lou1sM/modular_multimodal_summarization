        "Harley: Okay, this is creepy. No guard at the gate, no butler at the door, no servants roaming the halls. If this were a horror movie, I'd be screaming at the TV, \"get out, get out.\" Hello? Anyone home? Phillip? You called me. Get out here, please. Where are you, you power-crazy freak?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: (Sighs) we've been across this island so many times. Feels like I could be a tour guide for Santo Domingo. How do we even know if Holly is here?",
        "Tony: We have no idea. You know, this is the first island that we've been to, Michelle. We have to start somewhere. Am I right?",
        "Michelle: You know what, though? The people that we talk to, they seem like they know something's up, right? They're just too scared to say.",
        "Tony: Scared of what? I don't understand.",
        "Michelle: I don't know. Sebastian? Do you think he could hurt Holly?",
        "Tony: No, I just think that she's a bargaining chip for him. Something's not right.",
        "Michelle: For god knows what ...",
        "Tony: Shhh. Go, go, go. Get, get.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: Set it on the table.",
        "Holly: If I didn't touch the last three of those, what makes you think I'm going to touch that one?",
        "Sebastian: You're hungry.",
        "Holly: Not hungry enough.",
        "Sebastian: Is this your plan, Holly? Starve yourself to death? That'll teach me. Do you want to die? Because I don't.",
        "Holly: No. I know you don't want to die. That's why I'm here, to save you. The lure to get Dr. Ed here.",
        "Sebastian: We all need someone to save us, Holly.",
        "Holly: Nobody is going to save you if you don't let me go. Your time is running out, Sebastian. Blake is looking for me.",
        "Sebastian: Actually, you sent a very nice telegram to Chrissy a few days ago.",
        "Holly: What was the message?",
        "Sebastian: You didn't mince words. You said that you were fine and that she shouldn't worry.",
        "Holly: Great. Wouldn't want her to worry. Get out.",
        "Sebastian: Win her.",
        "Holly: What?",
        "Sebastian: You want to call Chrissy, I want you to eat. So, why don't you come on out and we'll play and if I win, you eat. If you win, you get to call Chrissy.",
        "Holly: What game are we playing?",
        "Sebastian: Chess.",
        "Holly: All right. Get the board.",
        "Sebastian: All right.",

        "Coop: Lizard. What's the good word?",
        "Lizzie: How is that nickname spreading so fast?",
        "Coop: Let me guess. You're slumming, right?",
        "Lizzie: I'm waiting for Bruno to come pick me up.",
        "Coop: Bruno's not coming. His son broke his arm skateboarding, so he asked me to fill in for him. Lizzie, this isn't exactly your part of town. Are we going somewhere?",
        "Lizzie: I'm going to the airport. Just going away for a few days.",
        "Coop: You're going ... for a few ... what are you...?",
        "Lizzie: You know what? I don't think that's any of your business, all right? You've traveled all around the world. It's okay if I leave a little while, okay? Get my stuff, please.",
        "Coop: Look, just so you know, you can tell me what's going on. The driver/passenger confidentiality thing?",
        "Lizzie: You know what? I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not lying.",
        "Coop: Lying? Please. Lizzie, you didn't even have to open your mouth for me to know what's going on. What are you running away from?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Hey, Beth. Are you okay?",
        "Beth: Hey. Yeah, I think so. Why?",
        "Gus: Uh, the Lizzie thing.",
        "Beth: What Lizzie thing?",
        "Gus: Last night?",
        "Beth: What do you mean, last night?",
        "Gus: Phillip didn't tell you?",
        "Beth: Tell me what?",
        "Gus: (Sighs) all right, I hate to be the one. I was at the police station last night, and Lizzie confessed to being the driver of the car that hit Sandy Foster.",
        "Beth: What? The hit and run was Lizzie? And Phillip knew about it?",
        "Gus: Yeah, I guess he didn't tell you.",
        "Beth: Why didn't Phillip tell me?",
        "Gus: (Sighs) why does Phillip do anything?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Olivia? I wonder if the ballroom could be set up for a Spaulding function later on this month?",
        "Olivia: I'm sorry. I just got asked to come to the house by Phillip.",
        "Alan: Well, why are you looking so worried? Perhaps Phillip will be offering you an olive branch?",
        "Olivia: The only thing he would want to do with a branch is beat me with it. Your son is a menace, Alan. We should all be worried.",
        "Phillip: Welcome back, Ruth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tony: Michelle, what do you say that we skip room service, hit a local restaurant, huh?",
        "Michelle: Sure.",
        "Tony: All right, okay. Then let's go.",
        "Michelle: Okay.",
        "Tony: Hold on, hold on. You're the captain who didn't show up, huh?",
        "Captain: I'm so sorry.",
        "Tony: Yeah, I bet you are. What are you doing?",
        "Michelle: He had it coming for leaving us out there to die.",
        "Tony: Well, do you think maybe you could have waited so I got a few answers out of the guy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: I like your game. The mighty dragon variation on the Sicilian defense. That's an impressive strategy.",
        "Holly: I didn't know it had a name.",
        "Sebastian: Oh, it probably doesn't. I just made that up.",
        "Holly: You know, normally people are quiet when they play chess.",
        "Sebastian: Normally.",
        "Holly: You can drop the act, this \"I'm charming and caring and would like to make your stay as comfortable as possible.\"",
        "Sebastian: Have I?",
        "Holly: I don't know. Maybe it's me, but I prefer my captors to be forthright.",
        "Sebastian: Would you have preferred that I kidnapped you? Stole into your bedroom and whisked you away in the middle of the night?",
        "Holly: At least it would have been more honest.",
        "Sebastian: Yeah, but where's the subtlety? Where's the art?",
        "Holly: Roger would have been so proud of you.",
        "Sebastian: Is that what you think I'm about? Making him proud?",
        "Holly: I don't care what you're about. I don't care if you live or die.",
        "Sebastian: You know I wish I could believe you, because it would make this whole situation so much easier. But the truth is, Holly that I think you're probably the only person in the world who does care. Check.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Lizzie? What's your deal? I mean, why are you running away? Not that I really care.",
        "Lizzie: I'm not running anywhere, okay? You don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Coop: I do know that your dad sent for the driver. So maybe it's more like you're being sent away?",
        "Lizzie: Mind your own business. Where's the car?",
        "Coop: You're daddy's little girl. Why is he sending you away?",
        "Lizzie: Why did you father send you away? Except for the obvious reasons.",
        "Coop: Whatever. Let's just go, okay?",
        "Lizzie: You know that's what happens. You know, they send you off to boarding school, off to some camp where bad kids go, and I don't know, the next thing you know, you're in with some famous shrink.",
        "Coop: Look, Lizzie, I don't know what's happening, but don't stand here and pretend that there's nothing you can do about it. If you don't want to go, don't.",
        "Lizzie: I can't just do that, Coop. It's not like that in my family. I've got to do what I'm told.",
        "Coop: You're the princess over there, Lizzie. Just do what you usually do. Start whining until you get your way.",
        "Lizzie: It's not like that this time, Coop. You don't understand.",
        "Coop: What are you so afraid of, Lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: There's no point in doing this, okay? Let's just go while I can, all right?",
        "Coop: (Sighs)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Gus, when Lizzie came to confess, did she ... oh, boy. I don't even know how to ask this question.",
        "Gus: It was an accident. I could see it in her face, okay? I think it was a very, very hard choice for her to come forward like that.",
        "Beth: And Phillip was the reason that she kept quiet.",
        "Gus: Probably scared her to death.",
        "Beth: Gus, how did things get this bad?",
        "Gus: You know ... I would actually be proud of her, if I were you. I mean ... to step up against her father like that. You know?",
        "Beth: What ... why didn't she call me? And how was she allowed to leave the police station?",
        "Gus: She left on her father's recognizance.",
        "Beth: Phillip goes on and on about how important his children are to him, but all he's doing is allowing her to think that she can live by a different set of rules. This has to stop.",
        "Gus: You're right. Before Phillip actually does kill someone. (Cell phone rings)",
        "Phillip: Beth?",
        "Beth: What the hell do you think you're doing?",
        "Phillip: Hello, Beth.",
        "Beth: I know about Lizzie. I know about the hit and run. Where is she?",
        "Phillip: She's safe. I've taken care of her.",
        "Beth: What kind of answer is that? Where is my daughter?",
        "Phillip: She's someplace where nobody can get to her or hurt her ever again. Not the police, not anyone.",
        "Beth: Phillip, what are you doing?",
        "Phillip: What you couldn't do. I kept her from being thrown to the wolves.",
        "Beth: What have you done? Phillip!",
        "Gus: That didn't sound very good.",
        "Beth: I have to get to the house.",
        "Gus: What did he say?",
        "Beth: I've got to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: Right on time.",
        "Olivia: Harley?",
        "Harley: (Gasps) Olivia. What are you doing here?",
        "Olivia: I was about to ask you the same question.",
        "Harley: Phillip called me last night.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, I got a note. Was there anybody at the gate when you came in here?",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Olivia: Has that ever happened before?",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Olivia: I half expect knives to come shooting out of the walls or poison gas to come creeping in or something.",
        "Harley: Thanks. I hadn't anticipated the knife thing.",
        "Olivia: So what do you think he wants?",
        "Harley: I don't know. But we can handle it.",
        "Olivia: So you want to work together now? That's kind of interesting.",
        "Harley: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Olivia: You and Bill and the mole you planted inside Spaulding.",
        "Harley: So you know about that?",
        "Olivia: Yeah, yeah. You hired some woman that I never even met to infiltrate Spaulding. What's her name? It's Ruth or something? We were supposed to be partners and you left me out, so you left me wide open for an attack.",
        "Harley: Okay, Olivia, don't you think you're being a little overly dramatic?",
        "Olivia: Am I? Because when Phillip found out about Ruth, he threatened to take Emma away from me.",
        "Harley: We're not going to let that happen.",
        "Olivia: Who is that? You, Bill and Ruth?",
        "Harley: You know, Ruth saved your butt. She's the one who saved you when Phillip had you detained in customs, okay? She's the reason you're back in this country.",
        "Olivia: I'll buy her a gift.",
        "Harley: What is this? Is this jealousy? Are you jealous of the time that I have spent with Bill? Are you jealous of Ruth? Because everybody in town is talking about the hot thing they have together.",
        "Olivia: I just don't want to lose my child.",
        "Harley: I don't want that, either. That's why I'm doing this. To make sure that Phillip doesn't win.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tony: That's great. The one guy who can tell us anything about Sebastian and where he is, and you just knock him out.",
        "Michelle: I'm sorry. I couldn't help myself, okay?",
        "Tony: Yeah, I noticed that.",
        "Michelle: This guy left us to fend for ourselves in the middle of a huge storm, Tony.",
        "Tony: Michelle, I had every intentions of hitting him, after I got information from him. Okay? Now, no more sucker punches.",
        "Michelle: Fine, fine, fine.",
        "Tony: Wake up, pal.",
        "Captain: (Gasps)",
        "Tony: Sorry about the head, man.",
        "Michelle: What are you doing here?",
        "Tony: Did Sebastian send you?",
        "Captain: Sebastian doesn't know that I never made it back out to you during the storm. He thinks I took you to land.",
        "Tony: Really? That's taking a chance, don't you think? Sebastian needs us.",
        "Captain: He can never know that I didn't follow his instructions. Look, I'm here to complete my assignment and help you contact Dr. Ed Bauer.",
        "Michelle: If you're here to help us, then what were you doing hiding out there?",
        "Captain: I didn't know if you'd spoken to Sebastian.",
        "Tony: Let me tell you something, man. Sebastian is the least of your worries. I'm the guy you need to worry about right now.",
        "Michelle: Look, just tell us where Sebastian took Holly, okay?",
        "Captain: I swear, I don't know. Please, just let me help you find Dr. Bauer. Sebastian Hulce is not an enemy you want to have. If he finds out I didn't follow his instructions, people I care for will come to harm.",
        "Michelle: We're not going to tell him anything, all right? Just tell us how to find him.",
        "Captain: Look, I really wish I could help you find your friend, but I can't. And I won't.",
        "Tony: The guy was a little scared, don't you think?",
        "Michelle: Yeah. Not good news for Holly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: You don't really hate me. You hate yourself for coming along, for needing to come along.",
        "Holly: No, I don't.",
        "Sebastian: There's nothing wrong with needing, Holly. I need Ed Bauer to save my life. I need you to ...",
        "Holly: What? Do what?",
        "Sebastian: (Sighs)",
        "Holly: To serve as a witness? To forgive you for God knows what crimes?",
        "Sebastian: It's not forgiveness I'm looking for.",
        "Holly: Then what?",
        "Sebastian: Hopefully, Michelle and Tony will do what they're told.",
        "Holly: Michelle and Tony have gone to the police. This place is going to be surrounded in no time at all.",
        "Sebastian: What's bad for me is bad for you, Holly.",
        "Holly: Meaning what?",
        "Sebastian: Checkmate. You don't get to make that call, Holly. You lost. Time to eat.",
        "Holly: (Screams)",
        "Sebastian: If you want to make this a battle, Holly, I will be happy to oblige you. (Screams in agony)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Well, congratulations, dad. You finally got what you wanted.",
        "Alan: What am I being accused of now?",
        "Gus: Well, you raised your number one son to be the king, didn't you? Get what he wants, get what he wishes for, fight for you along the way. But I think he's coming to the end of his reign. And I think that's what you wanted, isn't it?",
        "Alan: Now, wait a minute. Where is all of this coming from? I mean, has Phillip launched an attack on your beloved Cooper's again?",
        "Gus: No, it's a little closer to home.",
        "Alan: I don't know what you mean.",
        "Gus: I know about the accident and I know about the cars. And so do you.",
        "Alan: Who told you?",
        "Gus: Lizzie confessed to the police.",
        "Alan: (Sighs)",
        "Gus: Don't worry about it. I'm sure your number one son will cover it all up. But that just means breaking a few laws, doesn't it?",
        "Alan: It's according to whose law you're talking about, Gus. Phillip was right. Elizabeth is a target as well as the rest of his children.",
        "Gus: No, no, no, no, no. I think Phillip is the threat to himself, to his children, to Harley, to her kids. I can't let that happen.",
        "Alan: Wait, wait. Gus, Phillip would never harm one of his children. You know that.",
        "Gus: You're right. He would just bulldoze the home they live in. But that doesn't...",
        "Alan: Let me tell you something, you should have seen him with Zach this morning.",
        "Gus: Phillip was with Zach? But today is Harley's day with Zach. She always picks him up first thing.",
        "Alan: Well, obviously the plans have changed because they were together and they were having a great time.",
        "Gus: Hm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: All right, Lizzie. Well, nice knowing you. Not really. I was ... I'll just try not to be rude.",
        "Lizzie: You need to keep working on that.",
        "Coop: Yeah, well. Why do I feel like I'm going to regret letting you go right now?",
        "Lizzie: What?",
        "Coop: No, I didn't mean it like that. I'm just saying that I have a feeling I'm going to get off this plane, you're going to take off and then I'm going to find something out like you've just robbed a bank. Or you've stashed the Declaration of Independence onboard here, and all of a sudden, boom, I've become your accomplice.",
        "Lizzie: Get out of here. Just leave.",
        "Coop: I'm going to call my brother Frank real quick and just make sure that there's no outstanding warrants or anything that I need to know about right now.",
        "Lizzie: You can't do that.",
        "Coop: Why not? I don't take orders from your dad. Not usually, that is.",
        "Lizzie: Look, my dad was just trying to help me.",
        "Coop: Just trying to help you? What did you do, Lizzie? Hey, look, I've got the Chief of Police Frank, on speed dial here, so ...",
        "Lizzie: Okay, wait. Just ... I'll tell you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Hello.",
        "Harley: You're here, too.",
        "Beth: I live here. Has either one of you seen Phillip?",
        "Olivia: Ah, yes. The common denominator.",
        "Harley: Well, that's who we're here to see. He just hasn't shown his face yet.",
        "Beth: Wait. He invited you both?",
        "Harley: Called me last night.",
        "Olivia: I got a note at the Beacon today.",
        "Beth: Harley, I understand that you know about Lizzie.",
        "Harley: Yes, I do, Beth, and believe me, if I hadn't known it was Lizzie, I would have come to you first.",
        "Beth: I know that. I do.",
        "Olivia: What happened with Lizzie? What did she do this time?",
        "Harley: I'll tell you later.",
        "Beth: I don't know where Lizzie is, but my feeling is Phillip has taken her someplace. But would he do that? Does that make any sense that he would just flee with her?",
        "Harley: I think he would. If he thought she was going to incriminate him, yes.",
        "Phillip: That's a cynical view of a father's love. Well, nice to see the mothers of all my children getting along so well. We have a lot to talk about.",
        "Harley: What is this? Are we all here so you can threaten us at once?",
        "Phillip: No, just the opposite. I'm going to call a truce with all of you. Because this has got to come to an end.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: (Groaning)",
        "Holly: Are you all right?",
        "Sebastian: See? You do care.",
        "Holly: It's a reflex. You're in a lot of pain.",
        "Sebastian: It'll pass.",
        "Holly: You should be in a hospital. This is a ridiculous way to try and save yourself.",
        "Sebastian: No. No. It's the only way. Roger tried every avenue, every possible avenue and he failed. He didn't want to die, but he didn't have a choice. I do. (Gasping) (Groaning) Oh, God.",
        "Holly: Okay, breathe deeply. Concentrate on a part of your body that isn't hurting.",
        "Sebastian: Where ... where did you learn that?",
        "Holly: Try detoxing. Some days it was hard to find anything that didn't hurt.",
        "Sebastian: I know the feeling.",
        "Holly: Look, you know, we could try another way. Let me try and find Ed.",
        "Sebastian: No! No! I can't trust you. You'll walk away from me. I am fighting for my life! And I will do anything it takes in order to live. Anything! Don't make me prove that to you, Holly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: You know what? You can't just keep me here. I'll call the pilot and he'll have you kicked off the plane right away. Okay?",
        "Coop: Hey, look. The clock is ticking. So either start talking or I'm calling my brother, Frank, and I know you don't want police involvement.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, okay, okay. Fine. I was in a car accident.",
        "Coop: And? ...",
        "Lizzie: And someone was hurt.",
        "Coop: Oh, my god. Sandy Foster. You're unbelievable. Absolutely unbelievable, Lizzie. I'll tell you what. You know what? I'll take a walk on the tarmac, then you can go ahead and take the plane up and then use me as a target practice. How about that, Lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: You know what? It was an accident. I didn't mean to hit Sandy.",
        "Coop: Then why don't you just go ahead and admit that to the police.",
        "Lizzie: I tried. Don't you think I would do that? My dad got upset and that's why I'm here.",
        "Coop: So, what are you going to do? Are you just going to take off, go to Europe, party your way across the continent and then just forget everything you did here?",
        "Lizzie: Are you serious? Do you really think I want to leave my home and my family?",
        "Coop: I don't ...",
        "Lizzie: I don't even know if I'm ever going to come back.",
        "Coop: I don't even care how hurt you feel right now or how hard it's been for you. That guy almost died, and now you're going to take the easy way out of this.",
        "Lizzie: You think this is easy?",
        "Coop: You know what? You might get away with this today, but eventually you'll get caught, and they are going to find you, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Stop it.",
        "Coop: You know what? I was right about how you are so selfish and nasty. You know, I'm starting to think that you're almost as crazy as your father ever was.",
        "Lizzie: You take that back. I can't believe you ever said that.",
        "Coop: Look, I can't stop you from leaving. I can't make you have a conscience or even a heart. So, why don't you just go ahead. Live your life as a fugitive for however long that's going to last.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, wait.",

        "Harley: What is going on?",
        "Olivia: Why isn't anyone on duty?",
        "Beth: Where's Lizzie?",
        "Phillip: Be patient and you'll find out. I gave the staff the day off. And Lizzie is fine.",
        "Beth: No, no. Lizzie being fine is not good enough. I want to see her.",
        "Phillip: That's not possible right now.",
        "Beth: You can't think that you're going to get away with this.",
        "Phillip: Get away with what?",
        "Beth: Think of Lizzie. Think of how fragile she is. Do you want to push her over the edge again? Do you want to doom her to living a life like ...",
        "Phillip: Like me? Do you want to doom her to a life in prison? Have you given any thought to that?",
        "Beth: If it was an accident, we'll prove it. If not, she needs help.",
        "Phillip: Beth, you're being so naive if you think that Lizzie will get a fair shake in this town. We have too many enemies. Look around the room.",
        "Olivia: What the hell is going on?",
        "Harley: I don't know. Let's see. Phillip, what is this? Are we all here so you can threaten us at once?",
        "Phillip: No, just the opposite. I'm going to call a truce with all of you. Because this has got to come to an end.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tony: We should into be talking about what our next move is. In fact, I should be buying you a plane ticket on the next flight out of here.",
        "Michelle: What? Forget that idea.",
        "Tony: Michelle, you almost died going through this, okay? And I'm telling you, I think that we've seen the last of the easy parts. Things are going to jump off in a very bad way. I feel it. I'm telling you.",
        "Michelle: \"Jump off\"? Translation, please?",
        "Tony: Listen to me, please. Just go back to Springfield before you end up hurt or dead. Try to contact your dad. It's the best solution.",
        "Michelle: Oh, sure. And just leave Holly behind, right?",
        "Tony: Michelle, you saw the captain, didn't you? He was petrified that Sebastian would hurt his family if he spoke at all. I will send you a postcard the minute I find her, I promise you.",
        "Michelle: (Sighs)",
        "Tony: Okay, look at me. Please. You cannot risk not seeing your son again.",
        "Michelle: Tony, the whole reason I came on this trip is because I thought I might find something to help me feel more connected to that little boy.",
        "Tony: I know that, Michelle. Your son, Robbie, all he wants is for you to love him, okay? And you can't do that if you're dead.",
        "Michelle: I can't ... I can't walk away. Not now.",
        "Tony: Michelle, if anything happens to you, anything at all, I ... I can't forgive myself.",

        "Holly: And we wouldn't want that, would we?",
        "Sebastian: No.",
        "Holly: Okay, well ... all right. Maybe you're right. Maybe I let you lead me here because I needed to come. For lots of reasons. And nobody knows need like an addict.",
        "Sebastian: Except for maybe a dying man.",
        "Holly: Maybe. So, how about some food?",
        "Sebastian: Really?",
        "Holly: Yeah.",
        "Sebastian: Good.",
        "Servant: Another tray will be brought shortly, ma'am.",
        "Holly: Hey. Psst. I don't care about that. Come here. How much is he paying you? Whatever it is, I will quadruple it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: You should have seen him with Zach this morning.",
        "Gus: Phillip was with Zach? But today is Harley's day with Zach. (Cell phone ringing) hello? No, there's no security plans. Because there's no Spaulding jet flight scheduled today. Yeah, no I check the manifest every day of my life. I think I know what I'm talking ... it's okay. It's all right, we all make mistakes. All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: So, you brought us all here to put an end to the fighting?",
        "Phillip: Dad. Just in time. Come on in. Look, these last few months have been very difficult for everyone.",
        "Harley: (Scoffs) I wonder why.",
        "Phillip: Well, you're right. The mistrust, the hatred, people I care about turning against me, that is my fault.",
        "Olivia: What?",
        "Phillip: I know that I don't say this very often, but I have been wrong all along and everyone has suffered because of it. Your father almost died. Zach doesn't know whether to hate me or love me. And Lizzie ... well, I guess I have let her down, too. And you, Beth, so I am sorry about that. And Olivia ...",
        "Olivia: Don't even try this with me.",
        "Phillip: Well, I don't expect you to believe me, but a great deal of what I have done to you is inexcusable.",
        "Alan: Well, Phillip, I think I could give you a few excuses.",
        "Phillip: Oh, no, sure, there are reasons. Everything with Emma. The marriage at Ravenwood. The mad grab for Spaulding. But I did a great deal to push you to all of that, and I want it to stop. I ... I really do wish it could all stop.",
        "Harley: Uh-huh. Meaning what?",
        "Phillip: Just what I said: A truce. A cease-fire. An end to the games and the blackmail.",
        "Olivia: You honestly don't expect us to believe this.",
        "Phillip: I don't expect you to do anything, Olivia. I just wanted to apologize.",
        "Olivia: Phillip, this all sounds perfectly reasonable, but ...",
        "Phillip: Believe me or don't believe me, that's up to you. You'll have to search your hearts. The ball is in your court. Just let me know what you decide.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: Please, I'm begging you. If you help me, I'll make it worth your while. I have a lot of money. All you have to do is call this number. Call my daughter, tell her where I am. Tell her ...",
        "Sebastian: What did she ask of you?",
        "Holly: You've got these people scared out of their minds.",
        "Sebastian: Yes, I do. Do you want to leave?",
        "Holly: Yes, I do.",
        "Sebastian: You want to leave me to die?",
        "Holly: Why not? Maybe it's what you deserve.",
        "Sebastian: What I deserve? What I deserve is respect. What I deserve is respect and love and admiration, all of those things my father was denied. You know what roger needed? Well, I need it, too, Holly. The only difference is, I will not be denied!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: I'm not going anywhere, Tony. I'm not leaving you on your own when I'm the reason you're here in the first place. Look, I'm sorry that I hit the captain. I'm sorry that I jumped on board with Sebastian without knowing anything about him. I'm sorry that Holly is missing. You know, I actually liked her. And I'd really like to stay and find her. All right, we're in this together and I'm doing the best I can. So, do not fight me on this anymore.",
        "Tony: I won't. Come here. (Knock on door) (Cell phone rings) it's always something, isn't it? Answer the phone.",
        "Michelle: Hello?",
        "Aurelia: Hola. Usted desea las toallas frescas?",
        "Tony: Si, gracias.",
        "Michelle: So, that was the cop that was here before. Surprise, surprise. No trace of Sebastian Hulce.",
        "Tony: Well, I mean, the cops could be in his pocket, you know?",
        "Michelle: Somebody's got to know where to find the guy. Come on.",
        "Aurelia: Tu que busca a Sebastian Hulce? I used to work for him.",
        "Michelle: Can you tell us how to find him?",
        "Aurelia: No, Sebastian is very private.",
        "Tony: I'm Tony, by the way. This is Michelle. And listen, we would not be asking you if it was not a matter of life or death. We could pay you very well.",
        "Aurelia: Is she your wife?",
        "Tony: She's my ...",
        "Michelle: Sister.",
        "Tony: Yeah, my younger little baby sister.",

        "Coop: Lizzie, you're...",
        "Lizzie: Don't touch me.",
        "Coop: You're doing the right thing. Staying here, facing the music, you're for once taking control of your actions and your life.",
        "Lizzie: Coop, my dad is going to freak.",
        "Coop: And you can take him.",
        "Lizzie: No. I don't know that I can do that.",
        "Coop: Listen, I know this for a fact. You have a lot of people behind you that are very angry with your father right now.",
        "Lizzie: I know that, but ... okay, you're right.",
        "Coop: Listen. Hey, listen.",
        "Lizzie: Don't, please. Just ...",
        "Coop: For what it's worth ... for what it's worth, staying here was very brave of you.",
        "Lizzie: How would you like to pay back your debts? Right now. All of them.",
        "Coop: (Clears throat) how?",
        "Lizzie: You could be my alibi for the night of the hit and run. You could just ... I'll tell your brother that, I don't know, that I wasn't paying attention and I didn't know what I was talking about when I confessed. That's got to be worth $50,000 at least, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Well, okay. Not that I trust you, but do you think Phillip is for real?",
        "Alan: Absolutely. I think he was very sincere just now.",
        "Olivia: Please. He lies like breathing.",
        "Alan: Olivia, Phillip is not the monster you make him out to be, and I think you all know that he loves his family more than anything in the world. Now, I think this war has taken its toll on him, you and your children. I think he really wants to end this.",
        "Gus: Well, look at this. A meeting of the \"First Wives Club.\"",
        "Beth: Actually, it's the fourth, fifth and sixth, but who's counting?",
        "Gus: What's going on, Al?",
        "Alan: Phillip wants to end all hostilities and declare a truce.",
        "Gus: Really? You sure about that?",
        "Alan: Well, you sound as skeptical as they do. (Cell phone ringing)",
        "Gus: It's probably nothing.",
        "Harley: What's nothing?",
        "Gus: Is Zach in his room?",
        "Harley: No, of course not. He's at school. My father is going to pick him up.",
        "Gus: No, he's not.",
        "Harley: What is that supposed to mean? How do you know that?",
        "Beth: Excuse me? James was never dropped off at preschool this morning. And Lizzie is still missing.",
        "Gus: This ain't a truce.",
        "Harley: Daddy, it's me. Is Zach with you?",
        "Beth: Yes. I'm looking for James.",
        "Olivia: It's Olivia. Is Emma with you?",
        "Phillip: Oh, boy. You know what? We are going to have so much fun. We are going to have more fun than we have ever had in our lives. And Jude, you know what? I am so glad ... I'm so glad that you were able to come with us, because your brother Zach loves you very much. Don't you, Zach? Yeah. I don't know where your sister Lizzie is, but I'm sure she'll be here soon.",
        "Zach: Daddy? Where are we going?",
        "Phillip: We're going to go to a wonderful land far, far away where there are no more wicked witches.",
        "Zach: Yay!",
        "Phillip: Doesn't that sound great?",
        "Kids: Yeah!",
