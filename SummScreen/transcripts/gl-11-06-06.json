        "Mel: I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Time of death...",

        "Josh: There it is. That's it. That's it. See, she's fighting. She's fighting. Come on, Reva, keep on fighting. Keep on fighting, okay? Don't leave us! Stay with us!",
        "Billy: She's alive?",

        "Josh: Ten seconds, something like that.",
        "Cassie: So what does this mean?",
        "Mel: Well, it may not mean anything. Reva's very weak right now.",

        "Lizzie: I want you to take this with you. Just look at it really, really hard and keep this image with you when you go downstairs. Because I know what it's like to lose a parent and the second you walk out this door, nothing is going to be the same for you ever again. And this... this I know is changing everything for you, okay, but she is what you have to remember when you're down there. Because she is hope. Just hold onto that because I think you're going to need it, and I really think that that's what Reva would want. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Jonathan: It's Cassie.",
        "Lizzie: Jon, you better go.",

        "Frank: Look, I know it's going to be really tough for everybody to keep their heads in the game right now with everything going on with Reva. But you know what? We've got a job to do here. We have two very high profile candidates that need our protection. We're going to make them top priority. Understand that?",
        "Harley: Absolutely.",
        "Mallet: I'll take Blake's security detail.",
        "Frank: Are you sure for the job, with your recent injury and all that? I mean...",
        "Mallet: I just don't want to cover O'Neill's back, if that's all right with you.",
        "Frank: Okay then. We'll pick this up a little later. I've got to do a walkthrough with the commissioner.",
        "Harley: Hey, D, what's up?",
        "Dinah: Are you working?",
        "Harley: Yeah, we're doing election day stuff. Why, what's up?",
        "Dinah: Well, I was speaking to my mother, and we think that the police should keep an eye on Clarissa tomorrow. There are going to be lots of people, lots of crowds and I think that's a good idea.",
        "Harley: Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, no, don't worry about it. We've already thought about it, and we're taking extra precautions with the candidates' families, of course.",
        "Dinah: Good, good, good, good, good. So you have someone covering that?",
        "Harley: Including their stepdaughters. Yeah, I do actually have somebody on that. Could you give me one second?",
        "Dinah: Yeah.",
        "Harley: Hey, weren't you looking to do detail in Blake's camp?",
        "Mallet: Uh-huh.",

        "Buzz: You know, when Gus was gone, this never went out.",
        "Coop: You know Reva is dying.",
        "Buzz: I know what the doctors said.",
        "Coop: You don't actually believe...",
        "Buzz: Wow, what other choice is there but life? I wish I had a million of these things. Need help now.",
        "Coop: We do. Ava and Olivia.",
        "Buzz: You have hope for them?",
        "Coop: No, but I know you do. Dad, look, we could light a bonfire, and it's not going to make a bit of difference.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Why did you take off?",
        "Olivia: You had it under control. You told Jonathan about Reva?",
        "Ava: Yeah, I told Jonathan. The sonogram... did it freak you out, when you saw Lizzie looking at her daughter with me there?",
        "Olivia: Yeah. Please, Ava, come on.",
        "Ava: I just... did you ever feel that way with me?",
        "Olivia: Why are you doing this?",
        "Ava: I guess I just thought maybe you could identify with the way she was feeling.",
        "Olivia: I've had sonograms with Emma.",
        "Ava: I know that you hate me. I know that you hate the way you got pregnant, but Olivia, you were carrying me inside of you for nine months. Obviously, I don't remember that, but I know you do.",
        "Olivia: I was miserable the whole time.",
        "Ava: Was there ever one second-- one second-- where maybe you thought that you wanted me? Believe me, I don't really want to ask you this question, but, Olivia, I need to know. Did you... if things were different...",
        "Olivia: Then you wouldn't be here, Ava. That's...",
        "Ava: Okay. When you found out you were pregnant, was there ever, like, a second where you felt like you maybe...",
        "Olivia: Nothing, nothing. I felt nothing. What do you want me to say?",
        "Ava: I don't know.",
        "Olivia: What, I felt you kick and then I got maternal and wanted to go crib shopping and knit booties? That's the movies. In real life-- in my life-- I never felt emptier than when I had you inside of me.",
        "Ava: You had to have feel something?",
        "Olivia: Yes, I felt like throwing myself down a staircase. Lucky for you, I was a little too selfish. I was afraid I'd get hurt.",
        "Ava: Wow. I really need to find out who my father is because any good inside of me certainly didn't come from you.",
        "Olivia: No, it came from a rapist. Somebody who discarded me like yesterday's trash.",
        "Ava: I don't expect a hero in my life.",
        "Olivia: Do I have to remind you of how you got here?",
        "Ava: It's perfectly clear.",
        "Young Olivia: Don't worry, it's just thunder. I see you're kicking up a storm too, huh? Mom always knew what to say to calm me down. Hmm, no more kicking. Good. Because I'm pretty sick of you anyway. Waking me up at night. So don't even try to pull me in. There is no way I'm going to keep you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: All right, downtown. This is what we should do at the road blocks.",
        "Harley: No, you are not doing road blocks. Not with that hand. You're with the family.",
        "Mallet: Uh-huh. I know what you're doing.",
        "Gus: What is she doing?",
        "Mallet: I know what you're doing.",
        "Gus: What is everybody doing?",
        "Harley: It's your new assignment. I cleared it with Frank.",
        "Mallet: Dinah isn't one of Blake's kids.",
        "Harley: She's one of Ross's kids, Mallet.",
        "Mallet: But she's not a kid, she's an adult. Which is debatable.",
        "Gus: Look who's talking.",
        "Harley: Hold on.",
        "Mallet: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. See, that's what I'm talking about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: What? I'm feeling much better about the whole thing.",
        "Harley: No, you're not.",
        "Dinah: Yes, I am, okay? I think I will stay home tomorrow with Clarissa. She doesn't need to be here. I don't want to make a scene.",
        "Harley: So you waving at me like you're flagging down a plane, that's not making a scene?",
        "Dinah: All right, stop it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: There's O'Neill-- big O'Neill-- big shot, standing there with his big swirling drink going, \"come on in, let's celebrate.\" And there I am, I'm standing there, egg, egg, egg.",
        "Gus: Fake blood.",
        "Mallet: What?",
        "Gus: The fake blood that was spilled on your face by Dinah at my house. You've got a little bit by your ear still. You don't wash?",
        "Mallet: Oh, that's great. Great. Thanks for the heads up, man.",
        "Gus: No problem. Now, you going to go over there?",
        "Mallet: No, no. She's with Jeffrey.",
        "Gus: She's with Harley.",
        "Mallet: She's with, with, with Jeffrey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: I am not with Jeffrey, with him, with him. I invited him in for a drink. You think a guy could take a hint.",
        "Harley: Wait, you invited... who are we talking about? You invited Mallet in for a drink?",
        "Dinah: Yes.",
        "Harley: You invited Mallet in for a drink? To Jeffrey's room?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Is that bad?",
        "Harley: Dinah, I'm done. Why don't you just talk to him?",
        "Dinah: No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Oh, just go over there, please.",
        "Mallet: Not happening. What?",
        "Harley: You're so grown up, the both of you. This is called meeting halfway.",
        "Gus: As long as you don't let your other garbage get in the way when you're trying to communicate with each other.",
        "Dinah: Look, we don't have to do this.",
        "Mallet: No, it's fine. It's business. Harley said you're worried about your stepsister, Clarissa.",
        "Dinah: I didn't know that you were in charge.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I didn't know I was in charge either.",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Mallet: O'Neill is in the spotlight, right? Which means potentially he could be in the crosshairs. And you hang around him all the time, which means you could be in the crosshairs too, right? So tomorrow's a big day, there's a lot going on, all right? I get that you're worried about Clarissa, but who's worrying about you?",
        "Dinah: Well, it sounds like you are worrying about me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: How many times are we going to have to throw these two together before they stick? They're wasting time.",
        "Gus: Our time.",
        "Harley: They don't realize how lucky they are. Look at Reva. Don't they realize sometimes you don't get a second chance?",
        "Gus: We're going to get a second chance. We're having our baby. I know we are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Look at that. Look at that. It's getting stronger. Reva, don't quit on us. Okay, darling, don't quit on us.",
        "Jonathan: What's happening?",
        "Josh: Hey, hey, hey. We thought we lost her, but then she took a breath and now her heart's beating again. It's like she wants to come back to us. Come here, have a seat. Talk to her. Go, go, go!",
        "Jonathan: Hey, Momma, you do your thing, girl. Hey, hey, we're all here. We're like breaking every hospital rule being in here. Hey!",
        "Lizzie: Got room for one more? Two more? I brought this for Reva.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, come on, come on. We're trying to break a record here.",
        "Josh: Come on in, come on in. In fact, is there anybody else out here? Hello?",
        "Jonathan: Josh, it's not a clown car.",
        "Josh: Here's the thing, here's the thing. Here's what we're going to do, okay? We're going to get the rest of the family here. We're going to get all of Reva's friends, all of the people she's ever worked with-- in fact, maybe we'll get her dentist, and the postman. I don't know, but we're going to set up a schedule, round the clock, 24/7, one, two hour shifts, maybe. Everybody's sort of revolving around so she'll always have someone she loves here. She'll always have someone here fighting with her.",
        "Cassie: Let's do it. Let's do it. I'll make the list.",
        "Josh: Okay. Thank you. Billy, what do you think?",
        "Billy: You hear that, darling? We're circling the wagons for you. ( Laughter )",
        "Jonathan: Have you eaten?",
        "Lizzie: No, not in a while.",
        "Jonathan: I don't know, Company. We'll go to Company and find people there.",
        "Lizzie: No, no, Jonathan, just stay.",
        "Josh: No, no, no, it's fine. Just go, go, go. The more people, the better. Go, go, go!",
        "Bill: I'm going to go downtown.",
        "Josh: Go, go.",
        "Cassie: I'll look around, I'll see who's out here.",
        "Josh: Okay, I'm going to stay here. I'm going to hold down the fort. Okay. Okay. Okay. Come on, darling. You're almost here, you're almost home. Just know that I'm here and I'm waiting with you. So come back to me, Reva. Come back to me. Come on, darling. I can't remember what I was to about to say.",

        "Bradley Cole, \"Inside The Light.\" The day my son was born, well, we almost had the child in the taxicab on the way to the hospital, so that was a little scary. I was in the delivery room, and that is something that I will never forget. When Yoko and I were choosing names for our son, she chose Sean and I really wasn't into it at first because I thought, well, \"I already have a wife named Yoko, and I'm going to have to change my name to John Lennon or something.\" See Jeffrey, Wednesday, November 8, \"Inside The Light.\"",

        "Dinah: So I'm just another assignment?",
        "Mallet: I'm a cop, and I take my job seriously. You know that.",
        "Dinah: Oh, yeah, I know you do.",
        "Mallet: I don't want to fight.",
        "Dinah: I'm not fighting. I don't want to fight either.",
        "Mallet: Okay.",
        "Dinah: The other night you snuck up on me, I spilled some fake blood on you, it was a good time. It was very simple.",
        "Mallet: Yeah. I hope that fake blood didn't ruin my dress. Kidding. It was a joke. And then I delivered you to Jeffrey.",
        "Dinah: Delivered me? I didn't know he was going to be there. And you didn't even stay long enough for me to fix it.",
        "Mallet: Let's just forget it, okay? My job tomorrow is to protect your life, not weigh in on your love life.",
        "Dinah: Fine.",
        "Mallet: Fine.",
        "Dinah: Got it.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: We'd said our good- byes and we were literally walking out the door and he just knew. Even after Mel told us that it was nearly impossible, he just wouldn't let her go.",
        "Olivia: Josh not letting go of Reva? There's a shock, Cass.",
        "Cassie: What is wrong with you?",
        "Olivia: I don't know. I'm sorry. I'm glad that Reva's still with us.",
        "Cassie: We're looking to bring her positive energy here.",
        "Olivia: Then I'm the wrong girl for you today, okay? I do hope she pulls through. Have you stopped to think about what it'll mean if she does?",
        "Cassie: It'll mean I have my sister back.",
        "Olivia: No, I meant for you and Josh.",

        "Coop: Ava, look, she is not worth any of this, okay? Every single time you push Olivia for answers, you're the one that upsets.",
        "Ava: I'm not upset, I'm mad. I have all of these questions, and I hate it, but she's the only one who can answer them. Questions about my history.",
        "Coop: Look, you know exactly who you are, Ava. And just because you found out that your birth mother is a train wreck doesn't take any of that away. Any history you have with Olivia isn't history worth knowing. That's all I'm going to stay.",
        "Buzz: We got to get back to the hospital.",
        "Coop: Why, is Reva...",
        "Buzz: She's hanging on by a thread. Jonathan and Lizzie are there. I'll explain on the way. ( Cell phone rings )",

        "Lizzie: What do you mean?",
        "Jonathan: Well, you wanted Coop, you almost had him, but me doing the right thing screwed that up for you. You didn't want this. And I lost Tammy, but you lost, too, you know, and now you're stuck with me. I mean, I'll do my best to give you some kind of life you wanted. I don't see any of Reva's friends.

        "Josh: Okay, maybe, I went a little overboard, I admit that, sending them out to basically round up the entire world. But look at it this way, it's the kind of thing you would do, right? Something big and something wild, and before you know it, there's going to be a whole bunch of people here, Reva. People who love you and who are going to help you to fight. You're coming back to us, okay? And it doesn't really even matter how many people come here. I mean, maybe the postman won't be able to make it, I don't know, or your dentist, because people have lives, you know, and jobs and responsibilities, but I'm here. I'm here and I'm not leaving. And you can't either. ( Voices outside )",
