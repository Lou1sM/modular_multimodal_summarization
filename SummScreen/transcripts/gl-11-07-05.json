        "Danny breaks his kiss from Michelle and asks her what she is doing, she tells him that she wants him back and he tells her that he is with Marina now. After arresting the driver of the car that almost ran her over, Marina realizes that it is Alan-Michael Spaulding and strings him along for a while since he doesn't recognize her. She takes him to Company and reveals who she is. Alan Michael tells her that she reminds him of her mother, kisses her, and leaves. Reva walks in on Olivia in Josh's hotel room and brags to her that she and Josh slept together. Josh walks in on the conversation and realizes that things with Reva will never be the same. They decide to end things between them. Olivia goes to Company and tells Buzz that she thinks there might be a chance with her and Josh. Edmund surprises Cassie at the bridal shop, where she has gone to meet Tammy. He blames their problems on Jeffrey and tells Cassie that he is going to take her on the honeymoon that they never had. When she refuses to leave with him, he tells her that if she doesn't his assassin will take Jeffrey out. The owner of the bridal shop comes back and finds them and when Edmund says he and his wife are leaving, Cassie intentionally takes a veil so that the alarm will go off.

He tells her that they can do anything they want in the dark and they start to kiss. When the lights come back on she pulls away and he tells her that he loves her.

        "Danny: ( Sighs ) Okay, Michelle, are you going to tell me or what?",
        "Michelle: What? Tell you what?",
        "Danny: Don't... don't do that. You know what. What you and Marina said about me when you were stuck in the elevator.",
        "Michelle: Um, well, I guess I could tell you. But I've always believed that actions speak louder than words.",
        "Danny: Hey, Michelle...",
        "Michelle: I still want you. And that's what I let Marina know.",
        "Danny: ( Sighs )",
        "Michelle: Look, I know you care about Marina.",
        "Danny: I love Marina.",
        "Michelle: But there's also something between us, and I see it, Danny, every time you look at me.",
        "Danny: Michelle, yeah, of course there is. Of course there is. I will always love you. You know that. But Marina and I are...",
        "Michelle: Have a future together? Yeah, maybe, maybe you do. But we have children together. We've got Robbie, and we now have Hope. And if it wasn't for that little girl, I wouldn't even be here right now, and that says something to me. What about you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Man: Didn't your mother tell you to look both ways? Did I hit you? Can you move? Come on, then. Are you all right?",
        "Marina: Yeah, I'm all right. But you are under arrest.",
        "Man: I am? On what charge?",
        "Marina: Reckless driving.",
        "Man: You walked right in front of me.",
        "Marina: You were driving too fast.",
        "Man: 20 tops.",
        "Marina: More like 40.",
        "Man: If I was going 40, you wouldn't be able to arrest me.",
        "Marina: Oh, my God.",
        "Man: What?",
        "Marina: Nothing. Nothing at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: You know what? It was a good thing your battery was charged. I've been able to work through the blackout. You want to see what I put out so far?",
        "Reva: No thanks. I've heard the stories.",
        "Olivia: Reva, I was just...",
        "Reva: Working late in your boss's bedroom?",
        "Olivia: Yeah. But...",
        "Reva: Let me tell you something. Charging Josh's battery is my job, not yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Put me down. We're inside. The dress will be fine.",
        "Jonathan: There. You happy now? Let me light some more candles. You want something to eat?",
        "Tammy: No, I just want to call Sandy and tell him to pick me up.",

        "Tammy: ( Sighs ) I swear, somebody set it up for everything to go wrong tonight!",

        "Edmund: I came to see you, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Do you know where Tammy is?",

        "Cassie: What? No.",
        "Edmund: Please?",
        "Edmund: You look so beautiful, even more beautiful than you did on our wedding day.",
        "Cassie: I... I really have to go.",
        "Edmund: Not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet. Hey, do you remember what happened? We almost didn't get married because you ran away because of Jonathan.",
        "Cassie: I remember.",
        "Edmund: And then you came back and... and we said our vows, and we became husband and wife.",
        "Cassie: I don't want to do this.",
        "Edmund: Why not? Is it too painful?",
        "Cassie: Yes. And I don't want to think about it.",
        "Edmund: Well, I think about it every day. And I think about how we were going to live happily ever after, and then there was Jeffrey O'Neill.",
        "Cassie: Jeffrey isn't to blame.",
        "Edmund: Don't defend him!",
        "Cassie: Edmund, we both made mistakes. It just wasn't meant to be.",
        "Edmund: That's not true. That's not true, Cassie. That's not true. Whatever happened to standing by one another in the good times and the bad times? Whatever happened to forsaking all others?",
        "Cassie: Whatever happened? You went back to being... never mind. This... this isn't going to do either of us...",
        "Edmund: No, no, no, no. I want to hear what you have to say. Cassie, I want to hear what you have to say. I want us to be completely honest with each other, please.",
        "Cassie: It wasn't important.",
        "Edmund: Please. You were going to say that I went back to being the man I was before. Weren't you? Come on, you can tell me. You can tell me.",
        "Cassie: We are both to blame. All we can do now is move on.",
        "Edmund: But, you see, I can't. I can't. So you are just going to have to give us another chance, Cassie. Come away with me. Come away with me, and we'll have the honeymoon that we deserve. And then we will never come back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Sandy? I thought you were picking up Tammy at the dress shop.",

        "Marina: Give me your wallet.",
        "Man: Pay for your own doughnut.",
        "Marina: I'm not going to touch your money, okay? I just want to make sure you don't go running off on me while I go inside.",
        "Man: I'll go in with you.",
        "Marina: Just give me your wallet. Come on.",

        "Marina: He just about ran me over.",
        "Buzz: Are you okay?",
        "Marina: Well, I'm fine, but he drives like a maniac. I thought I'd teach him a little lesson.",
        "Buzz: He didn't recognize you?",
        "Marina: No!",

        "Danny: I'm with Marina now.",
        "Michelle: Well, don't look so tortured. You've got two babes that are hot for you.",
        "Danny: You think that's what I want? You know me better than that.",
        "Michelle: I'm making a joke, okay? I'm just trying to lighten things up...",
        "Danny: Why are you doing this?",
        "Michelle: I'm sorry.",
        "Danny: Why? Why are you doing this?",
        "Michelle: Because I'm tired of not doing it. I'm tired of being noble and pretending that I can live without you.",
        "Danny: You can live without me, Michelle.",
        "Michelle: But I don't want to. I want you back. I... I want our family back. I want us to be a family again, you and me and Robbie and Hope.",
        "Danny: Michelle...",
        "Michelle: Look, Marina is great. She's great, and if I had to be replaced, I couldn't think of a better person, but I don't want to be replaced anymore. And I'm just being honest now, with Marina and with you.",
        "Danny: That's fair. That's fair, and I'm being honest with you and I need you to hear me. I can't go back, Michelle. I'm sorry. I can't. What we had is gone. It's over.",

        "Tammy: No, not in this dress.",

        "Jonathan: I'll help you.",
        "Tammy: No. I'll just keep it on.",
        "Jonathan: And be miserable?",

        "Olivia: I don't want your husband, Reva. I have one of my own.",
        "Reva: Ooh, since when has that ever stopped you?",
        "Olivia: Do you really want to get into this with me?",
        "Reva: Someone has to call you on your crap, and my sniffer is as good as anyone's.",
        "Olivia: The only reason you're sniffing around me is to give you an excuse not to look at yourself.",
        "Reva: I never said I was perfect.",
        "Olivia: Oh, my gosh, she admits it! Somebody get it on tape, quick!",
        "Reva: You know, Olivia, at least I won't go down in the history books as being a home wrecker.",
        "Olivia: Let me see if I get this straight. I'm sitting here working alone, by myself, and that makes me a home wrecker?",
        "Reva: Among other things.",
        "Olivia: You know what? I think I get it. The lights went out and Reva got bored, and so she came to have fun with me.",
        "Reva: No, actually I came to see Josh.",
        "Olivia: Well, he's not here, but I'll give him the message you flew in on your broomstick.",
        "Reva: Ooh, I'd be careful if I were you. I may need to park that broomstick.",
        "Olivia: You know what? Jealousy is so bad for the complexion. It gives you wrinkles.",
        "Reva: We've been down this road before, Olivia. I always win.",
        "Olivia: It's not a competition. I don't want Josh. It's not my fault I've been spending more time with him than you have.",
        "Reva: Don't get used to it.",
        "Olivia: Well, when are you going to start performing your wifely duties?",
        "Reva: I already have. Today, as a matter of fact.",
        "Olivia: Good for you. Must be great to feel like you still got it.",
        "Reva: Believe it or not, I know what it takes to hold on to Josh.",
        "Olivia: Really?",
        "Reva: Hmm.",
        "Olivia: You know how to push his buttons, do you?",
        "Reva: Something like that. And I will do whatever it takes to keep him away from you.",
        "Olivia: Interesting. How do you feel about that, Josh?",
        "Olivia: ( Sighs ) Okay, well, I think I'll take my thing and I'll work at the office. Reva, it's always a pleasure.",
        "Reva: You can't pay attention to any of this. I mean, you know how crazy she makes me.",
        "Josh: Territorial.",
        "Reva: Yeah, we're like a couple of junkyard dogs, you know? Always going for the jugular.",
        "Josh: As I recall, you're the one that generally comes out the winner.",
        "Reva: I have a big head. ( Laughs ) You know how she gets under my skin. All right, you know what? I'm really sick of finding her in your bed.",
        "Josh: So you figured you'd beat her to the punch?",
        "Reva: No.",
        "Josh: No? Reva? You didn't sleep with me because you wanted to be with me or because you thought it might help us get back together. You did it to send a message to Olivia. I mean, that's basically what you were saying in here when I walked in, right? What was it? You know how to push my buttons? Hmm?",
        "Reva: No, I mean I said that to her but that's not what I meant...",
        "Josh: But now you feel you need to qualify it because I'm standing here in the room, so that's fine. Go ahead, do that.",
        "Reva: You know what?",
        "Josh: Give it your best shot.",
        "Reva: You're not being fair.",
        "Josh: I didn't realize being fair was part of the game.",
        "Reva: It's not a game! I loved what happened with us earlier today.",
        "Josh: Yeah, we made love.",
        "Reva: And it was wonderful.",
        "Josh: Mission accomplished.",
        "Reva: What, do you think this was some kind of master plan?",
        "Josh: What was it, just a mini plan then?",
        "Reva: It wasn't a plan at all. I just wanted to prove that you were mine.",
        "Josh: To who? Who did you want to prove that to, Reva, huh? Me or Olivia, or did you just want to prove it to yourself to make you feel better about yourself? You see, you know what's ironic about this whole thing? There was a time when I would have written this off to just classic Reva. In fact, I might have even been turned on by it somehow, I don't know. But not this time, Reva. Now it just tells me that I don't trust you. I don't trust you anymore, Reva. See, this afternoon... this afternoon gave me hope for us and for our future. ( Laughs )",
        "Reva: We don't know what our future holds.",
        "Josh: Reva, I love you. I do. God help me, I am probably going to love you my whole life. But don't you think it's about time we faced reality? We don't have a future, Reva.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Well, that's good, Danny. Let me know how you really feel, come on.",
        "Danny: Michelle, you want me to be honest with you.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, and you couldn't have been more clear. You love Marina, and your life is with her now.",
        "Danny: Michelle, you will always be a very important part of my life.",
        "Michelle: As the mother of your children.",
        "Danny: I will always love you Michelle. You know that.",
        "Michelle: But you've been there, done that?",
        "Danny: No, that's not what I'm saying.",
        "Michelle: Then what are you saying, Danny? Why won't you give us another chance?",
        "Danny: Because we hurt each other, Michelle, every single time.",
        "Michelle: We've always made each other very happy every single time. And you take the good with the bad. That's what relationships are all about, right?",
        "Danny: We have had so much bad, Michelle. We have had enough bad to last us two lifetimes.",
        "Michelle: Danny, we've also had a lot of good.",
        "Danny: Right, so what are we supposed to do? Are we supposed to just like... I mean, how many times do we have to split up and get back together to get it right?",
        "Michelle: However many times it takes.",
        "Danny: That doesn't make any sense, Michelle.",
        "Michelle: Okay, it's not ideal. It's not. But I love you and you love me. And I'm not asking you to choose, not right now. I just want to know that... that maybe we might have a chance? ( Baby cries ) You just got a reprieve.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Man: Ah, feeling better? The doughnut putting you in a good mood? Have you decided to let me go?",
        "Marina: You ask a lot of questions.",
        "Man: Come on. There was no harm done.",
        "Marina: This time.",
        "Man: Will it help if I apologize again?",
        "Marina: Probably wouldn't hurt.",
        "Man: I'm sorry, officer...",
        "Marina: Are you sure?",
        "Man: Yes.",
        "Marina: I'm actually surprised you haven't tried to bribe me yet.",
        "Man: That's not very friendly.",
        "Marina: Um, I just arrested you. Making friends with the perps wasn't in the job description.",
        "Man: How about insulting him?",
        "Marina: Did I insult you? I'm sorry.",
        "Man: What's with the giant chip on your shoulder?",
        "Marina: What's with being so full of yourself that you don't even recognize who I am, Alan-Michael Spaulding?",
        "Alan-Michael: Have we met?",
        "Marina: Just about a few hundred times. Aren't you wondering why I brought you here?",
        "Alan-Michael: You said you wanted a doughnut. Cops like doughnuts.",
        "Marina: Oh, my gosh. The Coopers own this place.",
        "Alan-Michael: I know.",
        "Marina: I know you know. Still no clue, Mr. Big Shot?",
        "Alan-Michael: Mr. Big Shot? Your mom used to call me that. Marina?",
        "Marina: It's officer Cooper to you. ( Laughter )",

        "Sandy: What do we do now?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you stay put because the bridal shop isn't far from here and Cassie and Tammy might still show up.",
        "Sandy: What are you going to do?",
        "Jeffrey: I'm going to go look for them.",
        "Sandy: Where? They're not at home, they're not at the store.",
        "Jeffrey: I don't know, but it's better than if I stay here.",
        "Sandy: You don't think Edmund...",
        "Jeffrey: No. No, no, Sandy. You know, that's the thing about the dark. It sometimes... it makes you see things that aren't there.",
        "Sandy: I guess so.",
        "Jeffrey: You know what? Don't worry. They're probably somewhere safe and sound worried about us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I'm not going anywhere with you.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, Cassie, Cassie, so quick to make life-altering decisions.",

        "Edmund: Really? Not even to keep your precious Jeffrey O'Neill alive?",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Edmund: Oh, you see, there's a sharpshooter positioned on top of a courthouse waiting for him to exit the building. It's really entirely up to you whether he makes it to his car or not.",
        "Cassie: You wouldn't.",
        "Edmund: Oh, yes, I would. And that without blinking an eye. You see, with him would die most of my problems. I'm sorry I have to do that, Cassie, I really am, but, you see, I don't have much of a choice.",
        "Cassie: Edmund, I don't love you anymore.",
        "Edmund: I know that. But you will. In time you will.",
        "Cassie: Don't do this.",
        "Edmund: It's too late, Cassie. It's too late for that.",
        "Cassie: It's not too late. You can call it off. I won't tell anyone.",
        "Edmund: Well, unfortunately, Cassie, you see, you're not in much of a bargaining position right now, are you?",
        "Cassie: Well, R.J. needs me, and Tammy's getting married soon. I can't just leave them.",
        "Edmund: I would never ask you to, Cassie. And when you are ready, we will send for them.",
        "Cassie: Please.",
        "Edmund: Come on, come on, come on, Cassie, don't be frightened. Don't be frightened. I would never hurt you, I would never hurt your children. I just want us to be a family again, and we will be one day soon. We will be.",

        "Jonathan: Look at me. Look at me. Don't think too much. Fighting it doesn't make it better. Fighting it gives you time to think. Thinking can be dangerous. Tammy, I love...",
        "Tammy: Don't! Don't say it! I'm with Sandy. He's my life. Marrying him is the best decision I ever made.",
        "Jonathan: What's this?",
        "Tammy: The biggest mistake. You can choose to live your life in the dark, but I... I choose the light.",
        "Jonathan: The only person living their life in the dark around here is you! You don't want Sandy, you want me! But, hey, walk out of here. Go, marry him. Fine. You keep lying to yourself. If that's not living in the dark, I don't know what is!",

        "Josh: Just tired, I think.",
        "Reva: Well, I'd say we could take a nap, you know, but I think we both know that wouldn't fix what's ailing us, huh?",
        "Josh: I don't think so, no.",
        "Reva: Why can't anything be easy? There was a time when we both would have fought real hard to make this right.",
