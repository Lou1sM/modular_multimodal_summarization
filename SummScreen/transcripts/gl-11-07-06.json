        "Buzz: Hey.",
        "Coop: Hi.",
        "Buzz: Is that order going to the hospital for the folks sitting with Reva?",
        "Coop: Yes. As soon as Ashlee gets off her break, she's going to take it over there.",
        "Buzz: Did you see Ava this morning?",
        "Coop: No, we both had to get up early for work. Why?",
        "Buzz: I was just wondering how she's doing, that's all.",
        "Coop: You mean if you wonder if she's any more interested in getting close to Olivia, don't you? Dad, you're pushing it.",
        "Buzz: Is she?",
        "Coop: No. As a matter of fact, she realizes that the less she knows about her birth parents, the better off she's going to be. Okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: Come on in. Are you okay with meeting here? I figured it would be better to meet here instead of at the office, seeing as...",
        "Ava: Okay, you said you had news for me, your people. Did they find out who my father is?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Can't you just tell me now? Okay, fine. 9:00 a.m., your room. And thank you. If we can find my father... Yeah, okay. I'll see you tomorrow.",
        "Olivia: I can't let that happen. (Knock at door) Hi.",
        "Buzz: You're gorgeous today. I hope you don't have to be anyplace right now, because I need your help with something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: Yes, of course, honey, I can pick you up today after school. No, of course I won't be too busy. I love you. I love you.",
        "Jeffrey: It's very touching.",
        "Blake: Happy election day, Jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: Right back at you, Blake. Did you vote yet?",
        "Blake: Yeah.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, then I guess we've already canceled each other out. All we have to do now is wait.",
        "Blake: I don't know about you, but I have a very busy day ahead of me, so...",
        "Jeffrey: Oh. And you're here because you want an extra shot of caffeine?",
        "Blake: I'm here because my friends, the Cooper's, they said that I could use Company today to hang out in. And where are your friends?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I like to travel light.",
        "Blake: You know, it's just so sad. You make being connected to people sound like a bad thing.",
        "Jeffrey: When you're too connected, Blake, it's... tangled, messy.",
        "Blake: So if you, by some fluke, win, you'll be known as the disconnected mayor?",
        "Jeffrey: No, I'll be known as the mayor who is able to step back and make an objective choice. So if you'll excuse me, I have a speech that I have to rehearse.",
        "Blake: Better make two versions.",
        "Jeffrey: You know, why don't we celebrate my victory together later? What do you say?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Wow. This town really is small, isn't it? I've got two candidates getting their coffee here at the same place right on election day. Mind if I join you?",
        "Blake: That is just about the nicest offer I've had in a long time.",
        "Frank: Well, good. Hey, Blake, this is a big day for you, right? I mean, Ross would be proud of you.",
        "Blake: You think?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Ashlee, if you have not noticed, today is election day, which pretty much guarantees that the \"Springfield Burns\" blogger is going to make some sort of an attempt to disrupt things around here. If that happens, and if someone gets hurt and we find out that you knew something that could have helped us to ID this creep and you withheld the information...",
        "Ashlee: I swear the last time, I told you everything I know.",
        "Marina: Ashlee, if that happens, you'll be in serious, and I mean serious trouble. And if you don't believe me, you can just ask your mommy, the DA.",
        "Ashlee: I already asked her, and I know, okay? I told you guys everything. The only conversations that I had with the blogger was through...",
        "Mallet: E-mail, anonymously. Right?",
        "Ashlee: Yeah.",
        "Mallet: Okay, thank you. You can go back to work. If we have any more questions, we'll call you.",
        "Marina: Excuse me. I thought that we thought that she was withholding information and that we were going to push her.",
        "Mallet: Pushing sometimes only gets you so far, and then sometimes you have to try a different approach.",
        "Marina: What is Diaz doing?",
        "Mallet: He's on active Ashlee duty.",
        "Marina: Hello? I thought that we were partners. It would be nice if you told me what was going on.",
        "Mallet: But then I wouldn't get a chance to see you get all huffy and puffy.",
        "Marina: Oh, you want to play? I've got one word for you: Dinah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Pretty good. So make sure you tell the press that I will be coming and that I will be available for interviews. Okay, thanks. No, no, no. I've had enough for one day.",
        "Dinah: What's going on?",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, I'm having the locks changed in case the \"Springfield Burns\" blogger decides to leave me a little victory gift. Of course, none of that would be necessary if our illustrious men in blue at the Springfield Police Department would actually do their job and catch this guy.",
        "Dinah: Victory gift. Wow, somebody's confident.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, have you seen the polls? Blake is going to get crushed. Dinah, this is my last day as a private citizen in Springfield. This is the last day for a lot of things, as a matter of fact.",
        "Dinah: Such as?",
        "Hank: All finished, Mr. O'Neill?",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, great. Thanks a lot, Hank. And make sure you vote tonight, huh? Polls are open until 8:00. Nice work.",
        "Hank: See you.",
        "Dinah: Did you get an extra key? I'm going to need a set.",
        "Jeffrey: Actually, you're not going to need a set, Dinah, because as of right now, we no longer live together. So what do you think? Blue tie or red tie for my victory speech? Can you imagine what it's going to feel like, Dinah, to have thousands, tens of thousands of people telling you that they respect you, that they trust you?",
        "Dinah: Maybe that's because you didn't throw them out on their butt.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, look, look. Tonight I'm going to be mayor of this town. I can't be shacking up with you or for anyone for that matter. I mean, how would it look?",
        "Dinah: The way it's always looked.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, once I'm elected, I'm going to have a certain image to uphold. I mean, that's obvious. Dinah, the last couple of months, they've been great. And I'm not denying that. I'm just, you know, all good things have to come to an end.",
        "Dinah: Clich\u00e9. How long have you been planning this?",
        "Jeffrey: Look, it was fun. It was... it was convenient. Why are you overreacting like this?",
        "Dinah: Overreacting?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah.",
        "Dinah: Overreacting, sweetheart? You would know if I'm overreacting. You would know. I'm not overreacting right now.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I hid all the matches, so I guess hotel is safe.",
        "Dinah: That's good. Just, you know, hold this over my head. I know you'd like me to lose the man that I love. Oh, wait a minute. Yes, you already did that.",
        "Jeffrey: Time to move on, Dinah. You know what? You're going to come to thank me for this.",
        "Dinah: Really? Really? I think that... are you embarrassed to be seen with me? Is that it?",
        "Jeffrey: No.",
        "Dinah: Wacky Dinah? In trouble with the law in and out? Let me tell you something, I am the former mayor's daughter. I have a very good job at Spaulding. I'm paid very well. What?!",
        "Jeffrey: You just don't get it, do you?",
        "Dinah: What don't I get?",
        "Jeffrey: Why I'm doing this, why I'm throwing you out.",
        "Dinah: No.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm doing you a favor.",
        "Dinah: Like hell you are. Please explain it to me.",
        "Jeffrey: If I didn't throw you out, if I didn't set you free, then how would you ever get back together with Mallet?",
        "Dinah: By God, you are a politician.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: Gosh, I've just been so busy, you know? I've been running so hard, work so hard I haven't even had a chance to sit down and think. And then today just came and I panicked. Because what if... what if Jeffrey wins? What am I going to do? What would I do with my time? How would I fill it?",
        "Frank: What are you talking about? You've got, like, three kids and you've got, like, ten careers going here. You don't need this job.",
        "Blake: Yes, I do. Yes, I do. I need it. I mean, for many reasons. It's just... well, of course I want to continue Ross' projects. I want to see them through and I want Ross to be proud of me, and I want my kids to be able to look up to me and see that I can make a difference.",
        "Frank: Well, I mean, it's what we all want, isn't it?",
        "Blake: I want more than that, Frank. I need more. I need this town to take me seriously. Pay some attention. I need everybody to see me as something other than Ross' little wife with 100 different jobs. I want my life to mean something, Frank. I've been so alone since Ross died. Where's my mom? I don't even know where she is. She's off God know where.",
        "Frank: I know, I know. You must... you must really miss her.",
        "Blake: It's so nice to talk to somebody. I feel like I've been so lost, like... I'm just out there in the middle of this lake and I don't have a paddle and I have nothing to hold on to.",
        "Frank: Oh, Blake, come here. Come on. Come on. Listen, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything that you've been going through lately. I really am.",
        "Blake: Thank you, Frank. You have no idea how good it is just to talk to somebody.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Listen, I was wondering... I'm very excited to move into the new police station. Look, I've got to talk to the Chief. All right. Right. Listen, Frank wants three people on each candidate at all times. Ramirez, listen up, okay, focus. I know you're exited, but listen. Has the bomb squad done their sweep? Okay. All the way up to... great, great. Okay. Later, thanks. Good. We're rocking, we're rolling, what else we've got to do? Motorcade. We're going to talk about the motorcade.",
        "Marina: Dinah?",
        "Mallet: I'm a guy. I'm a guy, okay? So work is good; feelings, bad. I'm also your supervisor and your partner, and we're also on the job.",
        "Marina: Well, partners share things.",
        "Mallet: I don't want to share this stuff.",
        "Marina: Okay, fine. Forget I said anything. If you don't want to say anything, don't say anything at all. Just stuff it down, way, deep down, inside of you, where it will start to eat away at your stomach lining. You should ask Gus about stomach ulcers.",
        "Mallet: Okay. Okay, all right. You saw what you saw. But did you notice how fast I shut it down? I don't... I can't... I can't be around her anymore. You know, I don't really trust myself around her anymore.",
        "Marina: Well, I can understand that.",
        "Mallet: You might be able to help me with that, though.",
        "Marina: I could?",
        "Mallet: Next time you see me talk to Dinah for more than 20 seconds, just pull out your gun and shoot me. Put me out of my misery.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Look, polls stay open until 8:00.",
        "Olivia: I know, I know. I'm going to be late doing some hotel stuff.",
        "Buzz: I thought we'd go to have a cup of coffee at Co2.",
        "Olivia: Yeah. Why? Who's there?",
        "Buzz: Ashlee, probably.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, and?",
        "Buzz: Coop.",
        "Olivia: What am I going to say to Coop?",
        "Buzz: You could have a nice conversation. It will be the first of many nice conversations.",
        "Olivia: And he's going to put in a good word with Ava.",
        "Buzz: She listens to him.",
        "Olivia: Buzz, stop it.",
        "Buzz: It's going to take a while for you to accept her as a daughter.",
        "Olivia: And vice versa.",
        "Buzz: Well, you could keep things from getting worse.",
        "Olivia: You're right. You're right. I should talk to Coop, but I should do it alone.",
        "Buzz: Are you sure?",
        "Olivia: Yes, I'm sure. I'll let you know how it goes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: Before I tell you what I found out so far, I want you to understand that it hasn't been easy. I've had half a dozen people working on it, both here in the states and down at San Cristobel, and it's been a tough road.",
        "Ava: Is this your way of telling me that you've hit a dead end?",
        "Alan-Michael: It's my way of saying that I've got so much information it's almost too much.",
        "Ava: A name. That's all I need. I just need a name of the man who's my father.",
        "Alan-Michael: I know. You would think that wouldn't be such a big deal.",
        "Ava: Oh, gosh.",
        "Alan-Michael: Yeah. Okay. Here's all the information on your adoption.",
        "Ava: This photo? Is this a photo...",
        "Alan-Michael: This is the day your adoptive parents, Connie and Greg, brought you home.",
        "Ava: I've never seen this before.",
        "Alan-Michael: Records from all your pediatricians, and from all the schools you ever enrolled in. This is all info on your stepfather. You know, school transcripts.",
        "Ava: A list of my friends from fifth grade?",
        "Alan-Michael: Like I said, my people are thorough.",
        "Ava: This is great. There's everything I could ever want to know about myself in here and nothing about my father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: That's interesting. What are you putting in there?",
        "Coop: Chocolate syrup.",
        "Olivia: Breakfast of champions. Yeah. I know you're busy, I won't take up too much of your time. I just wanted to apologize. I'm sorry, I'm sorry that the situation with Ava is causing so much tension between you and your dad.",
        "Coop: Don't worry about it. We'll work it out.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, I'm sure that you will. It's just... been a lot of things happening. There's so much going on and everyone's trying to sort out their feelings, really big feelings, and especially Ava. I know she's... she finds out she's adopted, she's lived her whole life not knowing anything and it's just big change. Look, now she's got Alan-Michael trying to help her find out who her dad is and it's just complicated. Everything is so complicated. How do you feel about the two of them spending so much time together, anyway?",
        "Coop: Alan-Michael is her boss. So whatever help she needs that he can give her, that's her thing.",
        "Olivia: Well, I think that's great. She's going to love your support. Are you joining her?",
        "Coop: Joining her?",
        "Olivia: Alan-Michael's suite? He's briefing her upon what his investigators have found.",
        "Coop: That's today, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah, I forget about that. I was actually just going to go on over there. Thank you for reminding me.",
        "Olivia: No problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: You're uncomfortable me knowing too much about you?",
        "Ava: No, that's not it.",
        "Alan-Michael: It's all part of the investigation. No stone unturned and all that, but if it bothers you...",
        "Ava: I'm grateful. Gosh, this picture of my mom. She looked so young. I used to think that I inherited so much from her.",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm more of a nurture over nature guy. At least that's what I like to believe.",
        "Ava: Me, too. So these thorough people of yours, did they do any research on Olivia's story on how she got pregnant?",
        "Alan-Michael: It's all in there. They tracked down a woman who was on staff at the party. Sounds like what Olivia's been saying could definitely have happened. The woman remembers an upset, disheveled girl being escorted out of the party. It made an impression.",
        "Ava: So you think it might be true? The way that I was conceived was...",
        "Alan-Michael: Not exactly story book? For once, I think Olivia's probably telling the truth.",
        "Ava: And the man, my father, was at that party. So maybe there was a guest list or something with his name on it?",
        "Alan-Michael: Right here.",
        "Ava: My father's name is in here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: You're 15 minutes late, guys. Come on, it's election day. Do you know how tight my schedule is today? I'm behind in the polls. I have to get out there.",
        "Mallet: Well, if it's any consolation, I voted for you.",
        "Blake: For me or against Jeffrey?",
        "Mallet: Does it matter?",
        "Blake: I guess not. So what's this about? A security issue? I got a message.",
        "Mallet: Extra precautions against our friendly neighborhood blogger.",
        "Marina: And put some extra undercovers out on the streets so we've assigned another officer to your personal detail.",
        "Blake: That doesn't comfort me. Excuse me. I know you guys are doing your best, but I... I hired somebody from Chicago to, just for today, just to handle things for me.",
        "Mallet: No, no, Blake, we run to show. If you wanted to bring somebody in from the outside into the mix, you could have informed us earlier. I don't have time to take a new person and catch them up to speed.",
        "Blake: Are you sure?",
        "Mallet: Yeah.",
        "Blake: Natalie? Natalie Briggs, this is Detective A.C. Mallet and Detective Marina Cooper, two of Springfield's finest.",
        "Mallet: Oh. Nice to meet you.",
        "Natalie: Nice to meet you. How do you do?",
        "Marina: Hi.",
        "Natalie: I have a few things I'd like to go over with you. Would now be a good time?",
        "Blake: Actually, you'll be speaking with Marina because Detective Mallet has something to do.",
        "Mallet: No, I don't.",
        "Blake: No? I thought you had to be somewhere...",
        "Marina: Actually, Blake, I'm sorry, but officially Mallet has to take this meeting. I don't have the authority.",
        "Mallet: Ah, yeah. So, Natalie, why don't we set up here and I'll catch you up on security details.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Very funny.",
        "Dinah: I don't think it's tight enough.",
        "Jeffrey: I don't get all this hostility. I mean, I'm cutting us both loose here. I get to become mayor. You move on, live long, and prosper with good old Detective Mallet, whatever else you want.",
        "Dinah: You know, sometimes I hate you, very intensely.",
        "Jeffrey: Good. Then that'll make it a lot more easier for you to move out. So here we go.",
        "Dinah: Okay. Why don't you tell me why you're so eager to get rid of me? What are you so worried about?",
        "Jeffrey: I told you. Told you everything.",
        "Dinah: Not the whole story!",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, the whole story. I get to become mayor so that means you have to find a new bed to sleep in, Dinah, or an old bed with Mallet. So good-bye, thank you very much. It's been fun, it's been real. What are you doing here? What are you doing here?",
        "Ditkins: I'm giving you one last chance, Jeffrey. Get out of the mayor's race now, and the agency will continue to protect you and stand by you like we have all these years.",
        "Jeffrey: And what if I say no?",
        "Ditkins: All bridges will be burned. All secrets revealed.",
        "Jeffrey: Not if you never make it out of this room.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bradley Cole, \"Inside The Light.\" If there were any story I would want to tell for Jeffrey, I think it would be to tell even more about his past, to reveal a little bit more of who he is. I think we see only still superficially who Jeffrey is and he's still hiding a lot. See Jeffrey, Wednesday, November 8, \"Inside The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ditkins: \"Mayoral candidate murders old pal on election day.\" Great story for Katie Couric.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm not your pal.",
        "Ditkins: I know. That's why I made sure a lot of people saw me come in here today.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm not dropping out. I've come this far.",
        "Ditkins: That web site is close.",
        "Jeffrey: No. I am close. I am so close to becoming mayor. I'm so close to erasing what I did, to erasing the things that you made me do. I'm so close to being able to look at myself. And I'm not going to let you or anyone get in the way of that. I paid my dues to you and that damn agency. I don't owe you anything.",
        "Ditkins: We gave you a way out, Jeffrey, freedom. Freedom.",
        "Jeffrey: Freedom? I was your slave. I was your slave for years. But you know what? That's over. That is over, and I'm out. I am so out. Now I get to live my life. Not the one you created for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: So as I was saying, I think it's a relief to work with people that I feel connected with.",
        "Natalie: Isn't it funny how you know these things right away?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, yeah. Chemistry, I guess. It's either there or it's not there.",
        "Natalie: Can't force it.",
        "Mallet: No, you can't force it.",
        "Marina: (Laughs) I think I'm going to throw up. Blake? If Mallet needs me, I'm outside.",
        "Dinah: Marina, how are you?",
        "Marina: Fine.",
        "Dinah: Good. I'm actually glad that I caught you here alone. I thought we could talk. I know that it has been very tense between the two of us, and I'd like to put that behind us.",
        "Marina: Tense? No tension here. You're the one who's accusing me of going after Mallet. Like I'd ever.",
        "Dinah: I know. And I'm sorry about that. Sometimes I speak before I think.",
        "Marina: You?",
        "Dinah: Are we cool or not?",
        "Marina: It depends. What exactly do you need?",
        "Dinah: Nothing. I don't need anything as long as you say that you were just partners with Mallet.",
        "Marina: Yes, I am.",
        "Dinah: I called the station and asked where Mallet was. He is supposed to be here. Have you seen him?",
        "Mallet: Next time you see me talk to Dinah for more than 20 seconds, just pull out your gun and shoot me. Put me out of my misery.",
        "Dinah: Marina? Have you seen Mallet?",
        "Marina: Oh, yeah. He's right inside.",
        "Dinah: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I'm loving this small town hospitality.",
        "Mallet: Well, we sure do aim to please.",
        "Natalie: I just hope I can pay you back some day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: Housekeeping can do that.",
        "Ava: I know.",
        "Alan-Michael: You didn't look.",
        "Ava: I know. I thought I wanted to. I mean, I do want to, but when it came right down to it,....",
        "Alan-Michael: The party was a lot bigger than we thought, Ava. Over 200 guests, more than half of them men. It's going to be a process of elimination. Who's too old, who was a no- show. It'll take a while, but eventually it will come down to that one name.",
        "Ava: Well, what if he's not on this list? What if he wasn't invited? What if he crashed the party? I mean, Olivia did. How are we going to know? (Knock at door)",
        "Coop: Ava? Ava, are you in there?",
        "Ava: Coop.",
        "Alan-Michael: Did you tell him you were coming over here? I'll get rid of him.",
        "Ava: Hey. I'm glad you're here. (Laughter)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Young Olivia: What was in that punch? I'm so tired.",
        "Young Jeffrey: The bedroom's this way. You can lie down. Come on, just a little further.",
        "Young Olivia: Thank you. You're so nice to do this for me.",
        "Young Jeffrey: Here we go. (Laughter)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: What caliber is that?",
        "Marina: Nine mill.",
        "Dinah: It's nice. I forgot I actually have something to do with Jeffrey a little bit later. That girl that Mallet is talking to, I don't recognize her. Who is she?",
        "Marina: That's Natalie. She's from Chicago. They're going to have dinner later. She's thinking about moving here.",
        "Dinah: Oh, that's good. That's good.",
        "Marina: Dinah, I thought you wanted to talk to Mallet.",
        "Dinah: No, no. Changed my mind.",
        "Marina: Hope I didn't give you the wrong impression.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Alan-Michael offered to help me find my biological father. I know I should have told you, but you didn't understand that I needed to do it. So it figured why would I even tell you until I had something, you know, to share?",
        "Coop: Ava, look, if I were you, I wouldn't do this. But if you do, then I will be the one to help you. I will do anything that you want, and I would have thought that you would have known that by now.",
        "Ava: I do.",
        "Coop: How many P.I.'s does he have working?",
        "Ava: A lot.",
        "Coop: And?",
        "Ava: And either my father's one of these hundreds of males on this list or he's not.",
        "Coop: Well, this certainly sounds promising.",
        "Alan-Michael: This stage of the investigation is slow going but I'll keep you posted.",
        "Ava: Thanks. Thank you.",
        "Coop: Yeah. Thanks, Alan-Michael, for all you've done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ditkins: Excuse me.",
        "Young Olivia: Something happened here. The night of the party. You know it did.",
        "Ditkins: Look, I sympathize with you, but we've done all we can to help you. So you just go home and forget this ever happened.",
        "Young Olivia: Forget this happened? I'm pregnant. How could I ever forget?",
        "Olivia: You.",
        "Ditkins: I beg your pardon, do you I know you?",
        "Olivia: I know you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Today, with your votes, you have shown me that you believe in the same values that I believe in, values like honesty and decency and upholding the rule of law. You've shown me that you believe in me, and that you trust me to commit and to serve... no, that's wrong. And you trust me in my desire, my commitment to make a real difference in this town. I thank you for your faith and your trust, and I promise that I will never let you down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: I did learn one thing that Olivia, I think she was at that party, at the Embassy, that was true...",
        "Coop: Hold that thought just one second. I think I left my keys back inside there. I will be right back, okay?",
        "Ava: Okay. (Knock at door)",
        "Coop: Hey. Sorry, I think I left my keys in here. Alan-Michael, let me introduce myself. My name is Coop and I'm Ava's boyfriend.",
        "Alan-Michael: Is this the part where you piss on my rug?",
        "Coop: You think you're pretty slick, don't you?",
        "Alan-Michael: Yeah, kind of.",
        "Coop: You want Ava to need you. That's why you're pushing her into this whole search of yours, isn't it?",
        "Alan-Michael: I paid for all of that.",
        "Coop: You know what? If Ava wants to continue that search, I hope she doesn't, but if she does, I will be the one to help her from now on. You got that?",
        "Alan-Michael: You ever heard that the tighter you try to hold on to someone, the more they slip away? But Ava's already slipping away from you.",
        "Coop: You wish.",
        "Alan-Michael: She's already learned the truth about her parents. Nasty folks, huh? That kind of revelation can just turn you upside down. You start to question what everything you think is right.",
        "Coop: No, I think Ava knows exactly who she is.",
        "Alan-Michael: But do you? What if by the end of all this, she finds out she's got more in common with me than she ever had with you?",
        "Coop: I don't know, Alan- Michael. What if at the end of this, Ava figures out that you're just a sad manipulative little jerk who's turning out to be more and more just like daddy every day? Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to get back to my girlfriend who's waiting for me. Look, I got them.",
        "Ava: Where did you get these?",
        "Coop: You know what? I was thinking that you and I can sit down together and go over them all. All right? How would you like that?",
        "Ava: I would love that.",
        "Coop: Good. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: A guy named Henry Cooper Bradshaw may be trying to make contact, asking questions about the research I had you do for Ava Peralta. Don't tell him anything. Better yet, don't even take his call. As far as this investigation goes, he doesn't exist.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: You know me, I hate long good-byes. So when are you going to see her again?",
        "Mallet: When, who?",
        "Marina: Who?",
        "Mallet: Yeah.",
        "Marina: Oh, come on, Romeo. Miss Security 2006, the one you were just drooling over.",
        "Mallet: Oh, yeah, her. No, she's not... she's not my type.",
        "Marina: No?",
        "Mallet: No.",
        "Marina: Oh, could have fooled me. Someone else?",
        "Mallet: What?",
        "Marina: Well, you know. You can thank me. While you were flirting away with Natasha...",
        "Mallet: Natalie.",
        "Marina: Natalie, Dinah stopped by.",
        "Mallet: Dinah was here?",
        "Marina: Yeah, and I just saw you guys and I kind of sort of led her to believe that you guys might have a thing or something.",
        "Mallet: What? Why?",
        "Marina: Well, it was either that or shoot you. You know, I pulled out my gun, but option one seemed nicer.",
        "Mallet: Right, right. That was good. That's good work, Cooper. Way to watch your partner's back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Knocking at door)",
        "Jeffrey: You've come back here to threaten...",
        "Dinah: I've been with you every step of this race. I have busted my hump and lost everything in the process, and I believe that you owe me. You owe me a roof over my head for however long I need it and a front-row seat to the grand finale. I am collecting.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ditkins: Miss, I think you have me confused with someone else.",
        "Olivia: You think? I'll refresh your memory. San Cristobel. Embassy party, an underage girl runs into trouble. A man who may or may not be on staff tries to make her disappear. That was me. That was me you tried to get rid of to protect someone else. I just want his name. Just give me his name.",
        "Ditkins: I was just doing what the Ambassador's assistant...",
        "Olivia: Don't, don't do that to me. You're on the inside. You knew the whole story.",
        "Ditkins: It was nice talking to you.",
        "Olivia: Do you think this is some accidental meeting we're having here? I have made it my life's mission to track you down. I know things about you that you don't want other people to know. If you don't come clean with me, I'll stand up on this bench and I will scream the truth about you to everyone.",
        "Ditkins: All right. Yes. I remember you. And I remember the gentleman you were involved with that night.",
        "Olivia: He was no gentleman. We weren't involved. He attacked me. Just tell me his name. Please.",
        "Ditkins: I don't have to. He's right behind you.",
        "Olivia: You think it is funny? You're playing a game with me?",
        "Ditkins: I wasn't lying. He's right there. Look more closely. Bingo.",
        "Olivia: Jeffrey O'Neill.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Olivia: No, it can't be Jeffrey. I know Jeffrey.",
        "Ditkins: I can only imagine how much you've gotten away with. You've seen her before. After what he did to you, we knew. We'd own him. Here's the thing. We need you.",
        "Young Jeffrey: Us?",
        "Jeffrey: Do you have any idea how long I've waited for this moment?",
        "Young Jeffrey: Who's us?"
