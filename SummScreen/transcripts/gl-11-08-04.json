        "Phillip: Come on. Come on.",
        "Zach: What's wrong, daddy?",
        "Phillip: Nothing, little man. Nothing. Come on over here and sit with me. I'm just waiting for your sister, Lizzie. You having fun? You having fun with Jude and Emma?",
        "Zach: Jude is scared and Emma and James are sleeping.",
        "Phillip: Well, you tell your little brother he doesn't have anything to be scared about, okay? Not anymore. We set? Let's wait just another ten minutes, all right?",
        "Pilot: Okay, but then the tower may realize that we're taking off without ...",
        "Phillip: I know, with no flight plan. Let me handle that. Honey, it's dad. I don't know where you are, but I hope you're on your way over here. Please hurry. Okay, you know, I'm going to have to take off as soon as I say good-bye to the kids.",
        "Pilot: You're not coming along, Mr. Spaulding?",
        "Phillip: No. I have more work to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Hi, sweetie.",
        "Mel: (Laughs)",
        "Rick: Well, hello to you, too. So, what is all this?",
        "Mel: All what?",
        "Rick: Well, let's see. My wife calls me up in her sexiest voice, tells me to meet her in the lobby of a hotel for a special night. Why don't you tell me what it is?",
        "Mel: Well, I figure since Leah is at my parents and Jude is at a sleepover ...",
        "Rick: Jude's not with you? Well, I thought you took him to the park today.",
        "Mel: Well, I did, but then Phillip showed up and he said you guys talked about him spending the night with Zach at the Spaulding's.",
        "Rick: No. No, I haven't seen Phillip today.",
        "Mel: You don't know anything about that?",
        "Rick: No. Did he seem okay to you?",
        "Mel: Um, yeah. I mean, maybe a little rushed.",
        "Rick: Oh, no.",
        "Mel: What? What? What do you think is happening?",
        "Rick: I'm not sure. I just ... you know what? It might just be a miscommunication, that's all.",
        "Mel: And the alternative?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Lizzie, I can't be your alibi. You've already confessed to the cops. What are you going to do? Just take everything you said back?",
        "Lizzie: I'll tell them I tricked them, that Harley and Gus made me.",
        "Coop: You're guilty, Lizzie. You hit Sandy Foster with your car and drove away.",
        "Lizzie: I didn't mean to, though.",
        "Coop: It doesn't matter. Does that make things better? No.",
        "Lizzie: Well, you know what? You're the one who talked me into getting off that plane, so at least you can cover for me. What do you want? I'm rich. I can take care of this.",
        "Coop: Oh, this I've noticed, but in case you haven't, your father is the one with all the money, and I don't think he's going to be giving me a cent of it.",
        "Lizzie: Well, that's fine. I'll just use aunt Alex's.",
        "Coop: Who happens to be in prison at the moment.",
        "Lizzie: Exactly. She's not going to miss it. Who knows how long until she's going to get out of there?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Where are you taking me? What are we doing here?",
        "Policeman: Ssh. Keep it down.",
        "Alexandra: Well, I'm not going to take one more step until you tell me what's going on, all right?",
        "Policeman: We're waiting.",
        "Alexandra: For what?",
        "Policeman: Your nephew.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Phillip's managed to get me a pardon. I know it. I'm out, I'm free. I am free! (Laughs) oh, ha!",
        "Pilot: You okay, Mr. Spaulding? Okay. How can you be okay when every person that you have ever known in your life--every woman, every friend, every relative--has turned against you? How can you possibly be okay? You get yourself into a little trouble and they just turn on you, make you think you're crazy, make you look like a fool, try to separate you from your children, from your sanity, from your life. What would you do? What would anybody do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: I think this is nothing more than a big misunderstanding, that's all.",
        "Beth: Alan, you must see that this is more than just a misunderstanding.",
        "Harley: Phillip must have been planning this all along. It's the only way he could have kidnapped all of our kids, all at once.",
        "Alan: Harley, please don't use the word \"kidnap.\" They're Phillip's children, as well. Now, look. If he has them, I'm certain there's a reason for it.",
        "Harley: Yes, there is a reason, Alan. He wants to keep them from us!",
        "Gus: The corporate jet is not in the airplane hangar. Phillip has just vanished.",
        "Beth: He's gone?",
        "Alan: Now, look, we don't know that, Beth.",
        "Beth: Oh, why didn't I see this coming? (Cell phone ringing)",
        "Harley: It's Phillip. Where are you?",
        "Zach: Mommy, it's me.",
        "Harley: Zach?",
        "Zach: I called to say good-bye.",
        "Harley: Oh, Zach. I am so glad that you called, honey. Where are you?",
        "Zach: I'm with daddy.",
        "Harley: Where with daddy?",
        "Zach: I'm on daddy's jet.",
        "Harley: Are Lizzie, James, and Emma with you? Sweetie? Are Lizzie, James, and Emma with you?",
        "Phillip: Zach.",
        "Zach: Don't!",
        "Harley: Don't what? Zach? Zach? (Sighs)",
        "Gus: Dead?",
        "Harley: I'm going to try to get him back.",
        "Gus: I'll make some calls.",
        "Beth: Harley? Did he say if Lizzie and James are there?",
        "Harley: No, no. He didn't have a chance. It went ... oh, it's off now.",
        "Beth: Did you get anything at all?",
        "Harley: I got that he is on a jet, and he called to say good- bye. Do you still think this is a misunderstanding, Alan? That was my son calling to talk to me and somebody wouldn't let him. Someone hung up the phone.",
        "Alan: Maybe Zach touched the button that disconnected the phone. Did you ever think that?",
        "Beth: Oh, Alan. When are you going to accept the truth? Phillip isn't well, and he's taken our children, maybe forever.",
        "Phillip: Okay, pal, time to fess up. Did you tell mommy about our secret adventure?",
        "Zach: No.",
        "Phillip: Are you sure? Okay. High five. That's my good boy. Because you know what? This is just a special trip for us. No mommies allowed.",
        "Zach: No mommies allowed.",
        "Phillip: Right, no mommies allowed. We're going to have so much fun. It's just going to be you and me and all your brothers and sisters.",
        "Zach: Where's Lizzie?",
        "Phillip: Just wondering that myself. (Cell phone ringing)",
        "Lizzie: Oh, my gosh. It's my father again.",
        "Coop: Ah. Um, answer the phone. Tell him that you've decided to stay in town.",
        "Lizzie: I can't just do that. He'll freak out. He doesn't know I have you as my alibi.",
        "Coop: Ah, you don't have me as your alibi yet.",
        "Lizzie: Everybody has their price. What, $10,000? That'll do?",
        "Coop: Well, congratulations. You're now officially just like your father.",
        "Lizzie: No, I am not, okay? I just need your help.",
        "Coop: Sorry, but I'm not for sale. I don't know what you think, but you can't buy my help.",
        "Lizzie: (Laughs) you're even dumber than you look.",
        "Coop: Well, I did get you off that airplane, didn't I?",
        "Lizzie: You jerk. Don't even do that.",
        "Coop: Hey. (Cell phone ringing) before you slap me again, you might want to answer your phone.",
        "Lizzie: Well, if my dad finds out what you pulled, he'll do more than slap you. (Cell phone ringing)",
        "Coop: Good. He's a guy. I can slap him back.",
        "Lizzie: (Scoffs) you're such a dork. Hello?",
        "Beth: Lizzie? Where are you?",
        "Lizzie: Mom?",
        "Beth: If your father is there, you need to get away from him.",
        "Lizzie: What? Why?",
        "Beth: Are you on the plane?",
        "Lizzie: No.",
        "Beth: Okay, listen to me. You need to find a way to get home.",
        "Lizzie: Mom, I am home. I'm in the east wing with Coop. What's wrong?",
        "Beth: Oh, thank god. I thought you were with him, too.",
        "Lizzie: What?",
        "Beth: Honey, your father has taken James, Zach, and Emma.",
        "Lizzie: Where did he take them to?",
        "Beth: Just come to the study. I'll explain when you get here.",
        "Lizzie: My dad took the kids.",
        "Coop: What do you mean, \"took\" them?",
        "Lizzie: The plane. He wanted us all on there. My dad wanted all of his kids on the plane so he could just, I guess, ship us off and never have us come back again.",
        "Coop: (Sighs)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mel: Tell me what's going on. What do you think Phillip did?",
        "Rick: I just need to talk to him, reason with him, that's all.",
        "Mel: Haven't you tried that already?",
        "Rick: Well, I'll try again. I'll try harder.",
        "Mel: Why would he take Jude?",
        "Rick: You know what? It doesn't matter.",
        "Mel: He's your son.",
        "Rick: It doesn't matter because I'm going to get Jude back.",
        "Mel: Rick. Rick, why are you doing this? You're always defending him, trying to make like everything's okay.",
        "Rick: Because it's going to be okay.",
        "Mel: Phillip ...",
        "Rick: Phillip is my best friend, period.",
        "Mel: Even after everything he's been doing?",
        "Rick: He was ill, Mel. He's had a tough time of things.",
        "Mel: Honey, if things turn ugly ...",
        "Rick: They're not going to turn ugly. I won't let them turn ugly.",
        "Mel: Listen, if they do, are you willing to do what it takes to stop him?",
        "Rick: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Mel: I don't know. Do you?",
        "Rick: Yes, I do. I'm going to bring my friend home no matter what he's done. I'm going to bring him home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: All right, we can't wait any longer.",
        "Pilot: What about your daughter?",
        "Phillip: I'll send her on later.",
        "Zach: Daddy?",
        "Phillip: Hey, buddy.",
        "Zach: Can I call mommy again?",
        "Phillip: Oh, buddy, mommy is already asleep by now.",
        "Zach: I forgot to say, \"I love you.\"",
        "Phillip: Well, I'm sure that she knows that. But I'll tell you what, I'll give her that message when I see her, okay? Okay. Hey, Marty, we set?",
        "Pilot: Yes, sir.",
        "Phillip: All right, you know what? Come here, listen to me. I want you to run now, real quick and let the attendant buckle you in, okay? All right, pal. I love you. You go on now, go on. I'll see you real soon. All right, take her up. And don't let anything stop you.",
        "Harley: Why would Phillip leave Lizzie behind? That doesn't even make sense.",
        "Beth: I don't know. Maybe he couldn't get to her.",
        "Gus: Could you tell if the plane was in flight?",
        "Harley: I couldn't tell anything. Zach said, \"don't,\" and then the phone went dead. What if Phillip's mad at him for calling me? What if he's punishing him?",
        "Alan: Phillip is not going to hurt Zach. He's not going to harm any of his children.",
        "Beth: Alan, Phillip isn't well.",
        "Alan: Look, I think we all need to calm down just a little and give Phillip a chance. We're not even certain what happened yet.",
        "Gus: You know something? You're awfully calm. Are you sure you don't know where he is?",
        "Alan: Of course, I don't.",
        "Gus: You're positive?",
        "Alan: I wouldn't lie about something like this, Gus.",
        "Harley: I knew that truce was a ploy. I knew he was setting us up.",
        "Beth: He was obviously trying to distract us so that he could get our kids.",
        "Alan: Yes, Charles Mcqueeney, please.",
        "Gus: Who are you calling?",
        "Alan: A friend at the FAA. Chuck, it's Alan Spaulding here. Fine, thank you. Listen, I have a favor to call in. I want you to check on my son. He has taken the jet out without a flight plan. Could you check it out for me, please? Excellent.",
        "Rick: Where's Phillip?",
        "Beth: Oh, Rick.",
        "Rick: Where is he?",
        "Beth: He's taken the jet. He's got James, Zach, and Emma.",
        "Rick: And he's got Jude.",
        "Harley: What? What? Jude?",
        "Rick: He tracked Mel down at the park, and he took Jude. Where could he have taken the children?",
        "Beth: We don't know.",
        "Harley: Why would he do that? Why would he take Jude?",
        "Rick: I don't know. He may have felt betrayed, I'm not sure.",
        "Beth: Betrayed? Why?",
        "Rick: I had him picked up the other night by a couple of orderlies. I thought it might shock him back into reality, make him question some of the things he's done lately, but he just ... it just made him angry. What the hell has happened to him?",
        "Mel: Your best friend has disintegrated months ago, okay? This man, the man who took the children, is insane. You should have never let him out of Ravenwood. He should be locked up.",
        "Rick: No, I don't know. I don't think he's so far gone that we can't bring him back, and I am certainly not going to give up on him.",
        "Beth: Neither am I. I will admit that Phillip has lost his way, but I'm not ready to give up on him, either.",
        "Harley: Then you are both nuts, because the Phillip we once knew, he's gone!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Oh, my adorable, exquisite nephew. Oh, my god. You got me a pardon. I knew it, I knew it, I knew it. I knew that I could count on you. Was it the governor? Someone higher up? Come on, it really doesn't matter, it really doesn't matter. Oh, thank you from the bottom of my heart.",
        "Phillip: Aunt Alex, please. Don't thank me yet.",
        "Alexandra: What? I am pardoned, aren't I? Or are we just escaping from jail?",
        "Phillip: Neither. You betrayed me, aunt Alex. And the one thing that I just cannot ignore is betrayal.",
        "Alexandra: Well, that's ridiculous.",
        "Phillip: Did you or did you not advise Lizzie to confess to that hit-and-run?",
        "Alexandra: She wanted to confess. She came to me for my support, and I gave it to her.",
        "Phillip: Without talking to me first!",
        "Alexandra: Well, I honestly didn't think that would be necessary. She's my niece. You know how much I love that child. We're family. We're all Spaulding's, Phillip.",
        "Phillip: Don't you understand? Because of you, it's all started to unravel.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, darling, I think you're the one beginning to unravel. Please.",
        "Phillip: Why would you do that? Why would you convince her to turn herself in? So that she can be in jail like you? Or end up in an asylum the way I did? What do you think is going to happen to her then? What do you think our enemies will do to her then? See, I'm not going to let that happen. No, I'll die before I let them get to her.",
        "Alexandra: Wait a minute, darling. \"Them,\" \"they,\" what? You're talking like the whole world is against us. Come on, Phillip, Lizzie had an accident. She's young, she's frightened. I'm sure the police ...",
        "Phillip: There will be no police.",
        "Alexandra: Phillip, for heaven's sakes, my only intentions were to ... were to help Lizzie.",
        "Phillip: Intentions don't matter, aunt Alex, only actions. You taught me that. And you have to be accountable for yours. That's why I have no choice, but to get rid of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: You okay?",
        "Harley: Fine.",
        "Gus: I'm ... I'm going to find your boys, okay?",
        "Harley: I know.",
        "Gus: Look at me. I'm not going to let anything happen to those boys. I love them just like you do.",
        "Harley: Please don't do this.",
        "Gus: Do what?",
        "Harley: Please don't complicate this.",
        "Gus: I'm not complicating anything. I just want you to know that I love them, too.",
        "Harley: I know. I know you're not doing it on purpose. It's just I'm handling all I can handle right now, okay?",
        "Gus: I understand.",
        "Harley: Thank you.",
        "Gus: Anytime.",
        "Alan: Well, I'm still waiting to hear from the FAA, but I'm sure we'll hear from Phillip before.",
        "Harley: Alan, would you please just stop this already? You're not fooling anyone.",
        "Gus: She's right.",
        "Alan: Look, I'm just trying to remain positive, Gus. Is there a crime in that?",
        "Gus: No. But letting them go, that is.",
        "Alan: He's my son, Gus.",
        "Gus: Is he your only son? Would you stop defending him and start seeing him for who he is and what he is?",
        "Alan: I'm aware of what has been happening to Phillip. I saw it before anyone else did.",
        "Gus: Oh, really? Then why did you let him go?",
        "Alan: Because I had to. It's what he needed.",
        "Gus: Do you hear yourself? You sound crazy.",
        "Alan: Look, I know you don't understand this.",
        "Gus: No, I don't understand this.",
        "Alan: No, but some day you will, because you will have a son of your own, and you will work very hard to help him become everything that is possible. And then the hard part starts and takes years because you have to let him go. And you have to let him live his own life.",
        "Gus: He took all of their children!",
        "Alan: It's because I pushed him! We pressured him!",
        "Gus: I'm not having...! I'm not having this conversation with you.",
        "Rick: We're going to find him, Beth. We're going to find him, and we're going to bring those children home, okay?",
        "Beth: Rick, do you really think that we can bring him back?",
        "Rick: We have to try. What choice do we have?",
        "Mel: Cut him loose. Let the cops deal with him.",
        "Rick: Don't start.",
        "Mel: Listen, honey, I don't mean to sound insensitive ...",
        "Rick: Well, you know what? You are being insensitive.",
        "Mel: Look, I know this is hard for you, but I don't want your feelings for Phillip to ... to cloud your judgment or put the kids in more danger.",
        "Beth: How did we get here?",
        "Rick: I don't know. I don't know. It's going to be all right.",
        "Lizzie: Mom.",
        "Beth: Oh.",
        "Rick: Lizzie, where did your father go?",
        "Beth: What took you so long?",
        "Rick: Lizzie, where did your father go?",
        "Lizzie: Look, I did not know he was going to do this, okay? All I knew was he was going to take me away, and that was it.",
        "Harley: Were you with him? Did you see the kids?",
        "Lizzie: Well, he told me to meet him at the airplane and he was just going to send me away then.",
        "Gus: To avoid prosecution?",
        "Lizzie: He said if I didn't, I'd go to jail, because I ... I confessed to the hit-and-run.",
        "Rick: What? What hit-and-run? What are you talking about?",
        "Lizzie: I was the one who hit Sandy Foster.",
        "Beth: Oh.",
        "Lizzie: It was an accident, okay? And Ruth Karloff, she convinced me to go tell Frank, and I really wanted to do it, but daddy was so furious. He just said it was better for me to just jump bail and get on the plane and leave. I wanted to tell you so bad, I really did. I wanted to tell all you guys. I didn't want to leave.",
        "Harley: Lizzie, calm down. How did you get away from him?",
        "Coop: She left the airport before Phillip got there.",
        "Gus: Did he say a destination?",
        "Lizzie: No.",
        "Gus: Did he say where he was going or what kind of clothes to wear?",
        "Lizzie: Um, he said to pack clothes enough for a couple of months.",
        "Beth: Oh, my god.",
        "Harley: Okay, and did he say coats? Did he say bathing suits? What did he say?",
        "Lizzie: He just said that mom, it was going to take a while for her to come around and then she'd go out there and hide out with me until he found an attorney good enough to represent me.",
        "Harley: Beth?",
        "Beth: What? No! Phillip never asked me to go anywhere.",
        "Alan: I think you're all missing Elizabeth's point. She decided she didn't want to go with her father. Now, did her father coerce her? No. Did he force her? No. As a matter of fact, he didn't even call her.",
        "Lizzie: Yes, he has, granddad. He called me over and over, but I just ... I didn't answer.",
        "Rick: Check the call. There could be caller ID.",
        "Gus: Take out the phone and call him right now.",
        "Harley: He'll pick up if you call him, Lizzie. But just be casual. No, listen, be casual, okay? And don't let him know you're here with us, whatever you do. Act like you're someplace else.",
        "Beth: Just be calm.",
        "Coop: Don't worry. She's good at lying. She'll get it done.",
        "Harley: Everybody. Quiet, please. Please, everybody, we have to be quiet. Don't even breathe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Phillip, you'd never hurt me. That's not who you are. I've known you since you've been a baby. This is something you just ... you don't have it in you, darling, and thank God.",
        "Phillip: It's amazing the traits that we discover in ourselves as we get older. It's funny, actually, because, you know, I spent my entire life trying to convince people that I was nothing like Alan. But in the end, you are what you're taught and what you know. I'm much more like Alan now than my biological father.",
        "Alexandra: Phillip, I don't know what you're planning, but please stop and think before you do anything you're going to be sorry for. (Cell phone rings)",
        "Phillip: I can't allow myself to be sorry. Lizzie. Where are you?",
        "Lizzie: Hey. You know, I'm sorry I didn't make it there. I left my phone in Coop's car.",
        "Phillip: Honey, I had to tell the pilot to take off without you.",
        "Lizzie: Oh. Well, I went to the store and I guess time just got away from me. I wanted to get some stuff for the trip. Um ....",
        "Rick (whispering): Ask him. Ask him where he is.",
        "Phillip: Is someone there with you? Who is that?",
        "Lizzie: No. No, no. That's just the driver. I'm trying to have a conversation, please. Okay, um ... okay, I can talk now.",
        "Phillip: No, actually, we can't. I'm not alone, either.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, that's okay. I can go there and meet with you. Where are you?",
        "Phillip: I'll call you in a little while. I need some time to collect my thoughts.",
        "Lizzie: From where? Dad, where are you?",
        "Alexandra: Where is Lizzie?",
        "Phillip: Never mind. All right, listen to me. I have arranged a boat for you. It's nothing fancy, but it will do the job.",
        "Alexandra: Phillip, are you planning an accident? Because ... oh, come on, darling. You'll never get away with it.",
        "Phillip: An accident? You think I would do that to you?",
        "Alexandra: Phillip, I ... I don't know what ....",
        "Phillip: I'm transferring you to another jail, aunt Alex.",
        "Alexandra: What ... what ... what ...",
        "Phillip: Just another jail in another county, one where the conditions will not be so amenable and you won't have so many friends to help you. And then in a few days, you will be transferred again. And again. And then again, until you are completely lost in the system.",
        "Alexandra: Phillip, wait a minute. What is going on? This isn't you ...",
        "Phillip: Good-bye, aunt Alex. I do love you. You tried to protect me from Alan when I was a little boy, and I will always be grateful for that. I thought I could count on you. I thought you understood.",
        "Alexandra: You can, darling. You can. And I do. I do.",
        "Phillip: No. Not anymore. You lost your way.",
        "Alexandra: Oh.",
        "Phillip: I hope you find it again.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, come on. No, no, Phillip, Phillip. No, no, come back here, Phillip. Phillip, you come back here. This thing isn't over. Oh, my God.",

        "Lizzie: Listen, I'm really sorry, okay? Daddy's just really mad at me for not showing up at the plane.",
        "???: Did you hear anything in the background? Did it sound like he was on a plane?",
        "Lizzie: No. I really couldn't hear anything. He just told me that he was going to call me whenever he collected his thoughts, whatever that means.",
        "Rick: Okay. I'm going to go look for him.",
        "Mel: Where?",
        "Rick: This is a very small town. If he's here, I'm going to find him.",
        "Mel: I'm coming with you.",
        "Alan: I'm going to question some of the help. Maybe they have seen something or heard something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: No!",
        "Alan: Phillip. Phillip. Phillip, get a hold of yourself. Get a hold of yourself, son. Pull yourself together and put that down. There are people down there. Put it down, put it down. How could it have come to this, Phillip? How could I have let this happen? I let them all get to you. And now maybe they're right. Maybe it is too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Look, I really do want to find the kids. I'm sorry. I really do want to help find them.",
        "Beth: I know you do, I know you do, and we will find them. I am so proud of you. You did the best job that you could. Oh, sweetie. If I had lost you, I don't know what I would have done. But you understand, right? You understand that covering up that accident, that that was wrong.",
        "Lizzie: I didn't mean to hit Sandy on purpose, mom. I swear, okay? And I wanted to tell you all along, I really did. I wanted you to know what was going on with me.",
        "Beth: And if I had known, I could have protected you, honey.",
        "Lizzie: That's what dad was trying to do.",
        "Beth: But as it turns out, you needed to be protected from him. That's what we all needed.",
        "Gus: Honey, I think that I'll call Frank, you know, bring him up to speed, okay?",
        "Harley: The police aren't going to be the ones to fix this, you know.",
        "Gus: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Harley: It means Phillip started this with my family, and that's how it's going to end.",
        "Gus: So you're going to handle this on your own?",
        "Harley: He took my kids.",
        "Gus: I know that. But we have to ... we have to work with the police, and we have to be methodical, and we have to be logical about this.",
        "Harley: You want to talk about logic? (Laughs) we're dealing with a psychopath who is capable of doing God knows what. I'm not going to sit around and do nothing while he disappears with my children.",

        "Phillip: Yeah, but not at you.",
        "Zach: I know. You're mad at mommy.",
        "Phillip: No. No, I'm not. It's my secretary, Ruth.",
        "Zach: Daddy, Ruth is mommy.",
        "Phillip: Is there anything that I can do?",
        "Harley: This is because of you. If you hadn't gone...!",
        "Gus: Harley, Harley!",
        "Harley: If you hadn't done this, he wouldn't be in that hospital bed right now! How can you walk in here looking so innocent?!",
        "Zach (echoing): Daddy, daddy, daddy ... Ruth is mommy, mommy, mommy ... is mommy ... is mommy ... (shackles clanging)",

        "Alexandra: I need to make a call. And before you object to anything, I'd just like to remind you that I am a very wealthy woman, and whatever my nephew is paying you, I will pay you double for a chance to make the call on a cell phone.",

        "Alexandra: Phillip has had me escorted down .... down to the pier. He's planning on getting rid of me. First, I thought he was going to kill me, straight out. No, he's going to have me transferred from one prison to another until, in his own words, I am \"erased.\"",
        "Alan: First the children, now you.",
        "Alexandra: What about the children?",
        "Alan: The children and Rick's son have disappeared. All the mothers--Harley, Beth, Olivia--they're half-crazed with worry. And I must tell you, Alexandra, I hate to admit this, but I'm scared. I think we may have lost him.",

        "Coop: Did you pack the straight jacket or is he already wearing it?",
        "Lizzie: You know what? My dad might have done some stuff that's not okay, all right, and he may be sick, but just because a person has cancer, do you get in their face and make fun of them?",
        "Coop: Open your eyes, Lizzie. Your dad is cancer.",

        "Beth: No, you can't, not this time. Your father hasn't even called you back.",
        "Lizzie: I know that, mama, but he will. I'm telling you, this is okay.",
        "Beth: He's not going to tell you where the other kids are.",

        "Phillip: Yeah, I guess so.",
        "Rick: So, what happened, Phillip? When did I become the enemy?",
        "Phillip: Ha. You tell me, Rick. I'm not the one that sent the guys with the straight jacket. When did we stop doing this? Or get together over a couple of beers? You're the one who couldn't talk to me, remember?",
        "Rick: Yeah, right. I hurt you and I'm sorry about that.",
        "Phillip: That's all right. No more than anybody else. They all turned on me, Rick. Do you have any idea what it feels like to be completely alone?",
        "Rick: See, that's the point here, buddy. You're not alone, not even close. You got me, Beth, Lillian. You have lots of people, Phillip. And maybe I overreacted when I sent those orderlies, but I wasn't doing that because I didn't love you.",
        "Phillip: He loves me.",
        "Rick: Yes, I do. But I also happen to love my son very much, Phillip. Very, very much.",

        "Phillip: No. He is much better off without Harley.",
        "Rick: No, I don't think so, Phillip. You see .... can you stop for a second? Jude can't fall asleep without his blue teddy bear.",
        "Phillip: I'll buy him two blue teddy bears.",
        "Rick: No. No, you can't ... you can't buy him what he's missing, Phillip. You can't buy a father's love or his mother's love. I'm asking you to give my son back to me. Out of respect for our friendship, after everything we've been through together, I'm asking you, Phillip, just for a moment, to put aside our differences and return my son."
