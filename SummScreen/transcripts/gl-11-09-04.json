        "Bill: All right, listen. We are going to find Emma. I promise. I promise you.",
        "Olivia: You can't make that promise. You don't know where Phillip took them.",
        "Billy: Hey.",
        "Bill: Hey, Dad.",
        "Billy: I came as soon as I got your message.",
        "Bill: Thanks for coming down.",
        "Billy: You okay?",
        "Olivia: I'm just great, Billy.",
        "Billy: You know, Phillip's crazy, but I really don't think he'll do anything to those little ones.",
        "Olivia: Are you kidding me? He already has. He stole them from their mothers. They're probably frightened to death.",
        "Billy: What you've got to understand, you know, he's been pushed. I mean, he's a father. He thinks maybe he's doing the right thing.",
        "Olivia: Why are you taking his side?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: You know, you didn't have to come.",
        "Josh: Of course, I did, Reva. I don't want you going up against Jonathon all by yourself.",
        "Reva: You know what? Nobody's going up against anybody. I mean, we're here to try to work things out between all of us. And you know what? He asked us to join him here.",
        "Josh: And you want to meet him halfway?",
        "Reva: Why not? I mean, seriously, how much worse can things get?",
        "Jonathan: Hi, Mom. This is the baby. That's Mommy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: You want out? You want out?",
        "Holly: Is that a real question?",
        "Sebastian: You tried to bribe my staff, Holly. I thought I could trust you. I thought you would understand.",
        "Holly: Understand why you've locked me up?",
        "Sebastian: Understand why I need you.",
        "Holly: To lure Ed to save your life. I get it.",
        "Sebastian: I didn't say why I needed a hostage. I said why I need you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Mom, Dad's not going to tell you where the kids are. If he's going to tell anyone he's going to tell me.",
        "Beth: No, Lizzie, I don't like it.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, what else can we do, Mom? Tell me. Okay, I'm the one who started this. Just let me find them.",
        "Beth: Your father is unstable. There's no telling what he might do.",
        "Lizzie: He wanted to send me out of the country. I'm the one who pushed him to this.",
        "Beth: That's not true.",
        "Lizzie: Do you even love him anymore?",
        "Beth: How can you...",
        "Lizzie: Do you want to help us, Mom?",
        "Beth: Of course I do.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, then let me do this all right. If I can't help him, then who will?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Everybody's really worried about their kids, Phillip. Everybody.",
        "Phillip: The kids are fine, Rick. They're fine. They're all excited about their new lives.",
        "Rick: What about their old lives, pal? What about their lives with their mother and me? What about that?",
        "Phillip: Come on. Let's play a quick game of one on one. First one to 11. I'll spot you two points. You look like you could use it.",
        "Rick: What are we doing here? What are we doing here?",
        "Phillip: We're bonding. Just like the old days.",
        "Rick: Okay. So what do you say we play for some stakes here.",
        "Phillip: What did you have in mind?",
        "Rick: My son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: This is not normal. You know that, right?",
        "Sebastian: I don't know a lot about normal. Do you?",
        "Holly: I guess not.",
        "Sebastian: Well, see? We have that in common.",
        "Holly: Sebastian, there are other ways to go. Other ways to save your life.",
        "Sebastian: I'm not naive, Holly. I know there's a good chance that Michelle and Tony won't make it or maybe they won't even try.",
        "Holly: Then why are we here?",
        "Sebastian: I told you, I need you. Whether I live or not.",
        "Holly: Why? Why do you want me with you when you die? You don't even know me. Don't you have family somewhere? Someone who loves you? Now, what is this? More pictures of me and my family.",
        "Sebastian: What do you feel when you see these?",
        "Holly: Is this some kind of a game?",
        "Sebastian: What do you feel when you see these photos?",
        "Holly: I feel happy and sad, and mostly sad.",
        "Sebastian: Yeah.",
        "Holly: Is this really how you want to spend what could be your last days? Watching somebody else's home movies?",
        "Sebastian: Do you know what it's like not to know who you are?",
        "Holly: What does that mean?",
        "Sebastian: Holly Margaret Norris, birth date December 7. Children: Christina and Meg.",
        "Holly: I know what you're doing. You think by seeing yourself in all of this it makes you a part of it.",
        "Sebastian: This isn't just about me, Holly. As much as I want to find a cure for myself, I want you to be well, too.",
        "Holly: I'll be fine when I get out of here.",
        "Sebastian: Fine. Is that good you have?",
        "Holly: I'll take it.",
        "Sebastian: You don't strike me as the kind of woman who will settle for fine. In fact, I think you're capable of soaring much higher.",
        "Holly: I am capable of falling flat on my face. I have failed in so many ways.",
        "Sebastian: How can you say that? You have two adorable daughters. Look at Meg. She is so precious.",
        "Holly: Yes, she was. And better off without me.",
        "Sebastian: Or at least that's what good old Fletcher thought.",
        "Holly: Fletcher--he's a good man, good father.",
        "Sebastian: Yeah, right. He wanted to be a hero. Wanted to save you from big, bad Roger. When he figured out he couldn't save you, he took Meg and fled country. Some hero.",
        "Holly: He was doing what was best as a father. Being a mother has not been my strongest suit.",
        "Sebastian: I wonder how it was for them? Growing up with such an extraordinarily beautiful mother.",
        "Holly: My daughters are beautiful. They're better people than I would ever hope to be. And happier.",
        "Sebastian: That was very mother lioness of you. See, you have it in you. And you're right. Look at beautiful Chrissie. She made such a lovely bride. Gosh, I wish... I wish I could have danced with her at her wedding. And with you.",
        "Holly: She was so happy. Even Roger could see that. They belong with each other.",
        "Sebastian: If you say so.",
        "Holly: Blake understands love, being loved in a way I never have. Having Ed in her life helped.",
        "Sebastian: Dr. Ed. Hmm. Nice hat.",
        "Holly: (Laughs)",
        "Sebastian: I wonder how it would look on me? I wonder how I would have turned out if Ed had been my father. He helped you with Chrissie, didn't he? And you helped with Michelle after Maureen died.",
        "Holly: I tried. I was no Maureen Bauer.",
        "Sebastian: Why do you keep coming back to that? Your inadequacies as a mother, as a woman.",
        "Holly: I know who I am and who I am not.",
        "Sebastian: And yet when I see you with Roger and Chrissy, I see a family. Intact, loving, secure, warm.",
        "Holly: Sebastian, it was never like that.",
        "Sebastian: Do you ever wish you could go back and make it all the way it could have been?",
        "Holly: What kind of question is that? What is this about?",
        "Sebastian: I just want you to...",
        "Holly: To what? Say I'm sorry you weren't part of it?",
        "Sebastian: No.",
        "Holly: What do you really want?",
        "Sebastian: I just... I just want to live.",
        "Holly: There's something else. There's more to it. You wouldn't have gone through all this trouble. What do you really want, Sebastian? Is it family, or is it me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: I'm staying at a room over at the beacon.",
        "Reva: You're staying at Cassie's hotel.",
        "Jonathan: It's half my Aunt Olivia's hotel, too. My room's on the house. I decided to collect on my trust fund. It's funny how money changes you. Makes you want to do things, you know, like buy snakes.",
        "Josh: Leave town.",
        "Jonathan: No, actually it made me want to get a fresh start. Nothing like a massive cash infusion to show you the possibility of... well, everything. Or at the very least, you can call some things even.",
        "Josh: Or just get even.",
        "Jonathan: One thing I did realize is that even with a bucket of money, there's some things that you can't do buy yourself, like wipe the slate clean. That's why I need you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: I'm not defending Phillip.",
        "Bill: I don't know, Dad. From where I stand, it sounds like you're taking his side.",
        "Billy: No, no, I'm just trying to understand him. Understand what he's doing so I could figure out why.",
        "Olivia: He's sick. That's why he's doing this.",
        "Billy: Now that's too easy. People have reasons...",
        "Olivia: I don't care what his reasons are. All right, he took my baby and I want her back. And the longer we wait, the harder it is... what?",
        "Bill: We could stop Phillip. We've done it before. We'll do it. That's it.",
        "Courier: I'm looking for Mr. And Mrs. Bill Lewis?",
        "Bill: Yeah. What do you got? That's us.",
        "Courier: Sign here.",
        "Olivia: What is it?",
        "Bill: Well, let's take a look. Note says it's a wedding present from Phillip.",
        "Olivia: What?",
        "Bill: Papers from the INS.",
        "Olivia: This is great. Just when my day couldn't get any worse. What does it say?",
        "Bill: It's about your deportation. It says here that Billy Lewis got the favor he asked for.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Lizzie, I can't allow you anywhere near your father right now.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, come on. Daddy's not well, and I know that. But who better than me?",
        "Beth: Is that supposed to be funny?",
        "Lizzie: No. It's just nobody gets Dad and nobody gets me, but somehow we get each other. And if he's going to tell anyone where the kids are it's me.",
        "Beth: God help us. You may be everybody's best chance.",
        "Lizzie: Well, I've never been anybody's best anything before.",
        "Beth: That is not true. The day you were born, you became my best everything.",
        "Lizzie: I'm sorry I haven't lived up to it.",
        "Beth: Hey, I am proud of you. I love you so much.",
        "Lizzie: So will you let me do it?",
        "Beth: Okay. Okay. But I say how it's going to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: You know people put so much stock in romantic relationships. Marriages and love affairs. A good friend is still the hardest thing to come by.",
        "Rick: You know what? You're right. You're absolutely right, pal. I mean I've been a good friend, haven't I?",
        "Phillip: What we had--our friendship--I can never put into words what that meant to me. We were like brothers.",
        "Rick: Well, it's not over.",
        "Phillip: See now Zach and Jude will have a chance to have something just as meaningful.",
        "Rick: You're right. You're exactly right. And they're good friends. Where are the boys, Phillip?",
        "Phillip: See I love Jude just like he was my own son, you know that. And he's Zach's brother. So it just made sense to take him along, too. Give him the same opportunity I'm giving my kids.",
        "Rick: Which happens to be what?",
        "Phillip: A perfect life, Rick. You know, life here has become such a mess, so complicated and ugly. Remember when it didn't used to be that way? Remember when we were young how simple everything used to be? When it was just you and me and Mindy and Beth. I've been thinking so much about those days lately. About the prom. Remember when we went to New York?",
        "Rick: You were running away from something, Phillip. Just like you're doing right now.",
        "Phillip: No, see, you'll never understand, Rick. The life that my kids would have here, they'd be always ... be like I was. They'd always be conflicted, they'd always be at war with themselves and Harley and Olivia. And even Beth. Even Beth would always be pulling at them, trying to make them into something that they're not supposed to be.",
        "Rick: Is that what happened to you, buddy?",
        "Phillip: I don't expect you to understand, Rick. Even though nobody has ever seen it as up close as you did. See what you don't get is, it's always been different for you. You know, you're... it easier to be the conscious. It's easier to be the one who always knows the right thing to say or do.",
        "Rick: I have no idea what to say right now.",
        "Phillip: You're here, Rick. That pretty much says it all.",
        "Rick: Yes, I am. I'm here, and I'm not just here to get my kid back, but those other children, Phillip.",
        "Phillip: Then why else?",
        "Rick: For you. You're the best friend I've ever had. I just thought I'd give it one last chance to bring you back.",
        "Phillip: I take it you're speaking metaphorically.",
        "Rick: No, as a matter of fact, I'm not. We can walk right out of here, grab a beer and just try to figure this thing out, buddy. What do you say?",
        "Phillip: We don't have much time. People are looking for me. Let's play one last game for old times sake.",
        "Rick: Sure. Why not? (Ball bouncing)",
        "Phillip: (Moaning) Rick. You tricked me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: This would be an elaborate way to score a date, don't you think?",
        "Holly: I don't know I've been on a few that were weird.",
        "Sebastian: I'm sure you have.",
        "Holly: Don't think I've ever seen you smile.",
        "Sebastian: You sure I'm not just baring my fangs.",
        "Holly: No. I'm not sure at all.",
        "Sebastian: Neither am I.",
        "Holly: If you let me go, we could still....",
        "Sebastian: Can you just once stop thinking about yourself! I'm sorry. It's the illness. It makes me moody. Or maybe that's just dying that does that.",
        "Holly: You watched your father go through all this so you... you watched your own fate.",
        "Sebastian: It's not everyday that a man gets to see how his story ends. Not that I'm accepting that this is where it ends for me.",
        "Holly: You say it makes you moody. Was he... did it make him...",
        "Sebastian: Violent? Is that what you're asking? As this gets worse, will I get worse? Yeah. Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Let me see that. Look, this is a lie. It's a lie.",
        "Olivia: Is this true, Billy?",
        "Billy: He's trying to drive a wedge.",
        "Olivia: Is it true.",
        "Bill: Dad, will answer her question? Did you try to have her deported or not?",
        "Billy: Look, you got to understand...",
        "Olivia: You invite me into your family, you throw me a party. Do you even care that I have a child, Billy Lewis? You may hate my guts, but I'm a mother and I'm a good one. And I love my baby. She could have been taken away from me because of you. You're no better than Phillip.",
        "Billy: Look, wait. Wait a second, son.",
        "Bill: No. No, no. Don't even try to say that you did this for me. Because if you even try to tell me that, I'm going to walk out that door and you won't have a son anymore.",
        "Billy: But you don't know the pain and suffering that that woman caused this family.",
        "Bill: Oh, don't give me that, Dad.",
        "Billy: I really just wanted to do what was best for you.",
        "Bill: For me. No, don't even say that because you did this for yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: So, did you put Lou somewhere where no one will die?",
        "Jonathan: He's not big enough to eat people... yet.",
        "Reva: So you said that you wanted something from us.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. I want to forget the last month ever happened.",
        "Josh: Really?",
        "Jonathan: You forgive me, I forgive you. No strings attached. It's a better deal than I've been given lately.",
        "Reva: Deal? What deal?",
        "Jonathan: Oh, nothing. Just a figure of speech.",
        "Josh: You know what?",
        "Jonathan: Hold that thought, Josh. You know, I can go around being a hell raiser forever. I could be a raging mad man. My mother loves another boy who she thinks is me! Oh, no! Oh, the horror! Oh! And now this other boy, he tried to kill me. But now I'm back! And everyone is going to pay!",
        "Josh: Don't be touching me!",
        "Jonathan: (Laughs)",
        "Reva: I'm glad you find this funny.",
        "Jonathan: Did I do what you would have done? Tell me, Josh, when you're up against it, what would you do? Would you bribe someone? Beat the snot out of them, huh? Huh?",
        "Josh: This is great, your son is trying to blackmail me here and now. He has information that he thinks I don't want you to hear.",
        "Reva: What kind of information.",
        "Josh: You think I'm going to let you hold this over my head? Are you out of your mind?",
        "Jonathan: Joshua, calm down. It was a joke.",
        "Josh: Well, I guess I don't have the same sense of humor. What he's trying to tell you, Reva, is that I set him up. I framed him for stealing my wallet so I could teach him a lesson. I also tried to bribe him to get him to leave town. That's what he wants to say to you, and it's true. And let me tell you something. If I didn't love you so much, I would have done a whole lot worse.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick and Phillip: (Gasping)",
        "Rick and Phillip: (Gasping)",
        "Phillip: Why? How did we get here? How did it go this far?",
        "Rick: You. My son...",
        "Phillip: I trusted you. I trusted you more than anybody in the world, Rick. How could you do this to me?",
        "Rick: My little boy.",
        "Phillip: Your boy is fine, Rick. I'm doing this to protect him. I'm going to save him.",
        "Rick: I'm was trying to... I was trying to protect you. But my son...",
        "Phillip: Oh, God, Rick, you just don't understand. I know it hurts, but you've got Leah. Ands it wasn't suppose to be this way. I wanted you to come, too. I wanted you to come and stay as long as you wanted to. Why did you have to ruin it?",
        "Rick: Pal, you need help. You need...",
        "Phillip: You're right. I needed your help. And you did this. I never thought it would be you.",
        "Rick: Neither did I. Neither did I.",
        "Phillip: There's only person that I could still really trust. Only one. (Phone rings)",
        "Lizzie: It's Daddy.",
        "Beth: Remember what I said.",
        "Lizzie: Hello?",
        "Phillip: Lizzie, it's me. Are you alone? Can you talk?",
        "Lizzie: Hey, Daddy, where are you?",
        "Phillip: Never mind about that right now.",
        "Lizzie: Look, I am really sorry I didn't make it to the plane. I just... I panicked.",
        "Phillip: Is there a problem? Where are you right now?",
        "Lizzie: I'm on my way down to the docks. You know, you were right. I do need to leave. It's the best thing for everyone.",
        "Phillip: I'll come get you right now.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. I'll see you there. Well, it's done. It's done.",
        "Phillip: Time to go, pal.",
        "Rick: Where's my son?",
        "Phillip: I can't tell you that, Rick.",
        "Rick: Where's my....",
        "Phillip: I really did love you, buddy. I'll always remember.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: For some reason, the only person you've been able to connect to was on his death bed and you are scared and you are terrified that you're going to die alone. Well, let me tell you something, no matter if I'm....",
        "Sebastian: Stop!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: I will be in the car. If you sense anything is wrong, I want you to turn around...",
        "Lizzie: I know, Mom. You'll fly in and run down Dad. Got it.",
        "Beth: Honey, I'm not going there to hurt your father. I'm going there to get back your brothers and your sister. (Cell phone rings)",
        "Beth: Hello. I'm sorry. I can't hear you. Oh, my god. Honey, I have to go.",
        "Lizzie: What about the plan?",
        "Beth: The plan can wait. Do you hear me? I want you to stay here with your grandmother. Don't you go anywhere near your father. Do you understand? This is a matter of life and death. I have to go, but you stay here.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. I'll stay here with Nana. I didn't promise. Not that that ever mattered before.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: I guess I just bring out the best in everyone.",
        "Reva: Would you excuse us for a moment?",
        "Jonathan: Hey, for the record I was going to help you out. I was going to stay quiet. You gotta learn to read the signs.",
        "Josh: Let's go.",
        "Jonathan: What's up, Olivia?",
        "Olivia: Well, for starters may baby was kidnapped, and it just keeps getting better and better.",
        "Jonathan: Calm down. Who took him?",
        "Olivia: You want to help me?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Yeah, I do.",

        "Beth: Rick? Rick? Oh, my god. What happened?",
        "Rick: Phillip...",
        "Beth: Rick. Phillip? Phillip did this to you? Did he say were the children are?",

        "Lizzie: Hi, Daddy.",
        "Phillip: Sweetheart. Come here. I wasn't sure that you were going to come. I know that what I'm asking you to do is difficult, sweetheart. I know you have your friends and your family.",
        "Lizzie: Daddy, it's just difficult. You know when you don't want to leave Springfield, it's kind of scary.",
        "Phillip: Yeah, I know. But, honey, I promise you, where I'm taking you is going to make this place seem like exactly what it is: Hell on earth.",
        "Lizzie: Where are you taking me?",
        "Phillip: It's a surprise. Come on.",
        "Lizzie: Wait. Can we get Mom and say good-bye before we go. I won't tell her where we're going.",
        "Phillip: No, honey, I'm sorry. You can't. You can't do that.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, well, can I call her?",
        "Phillip: No.",
        "Lizzie: But, Dad, you said before that...",

        "Lizzie: Wait. I really don't know if I can do that, Daddy. I mean I don't know where I'm going. I don't... I can't call my Mom?",
        "Phillip: Lizzie, you said you trusted me before. Were you lying?",
        "Lizzie: No, Daddy, I wasn't lying. It still would feel better if Mommy knew where I was.",
        "Phillip: I'll tell her, okay. I'll let her know.",
        "Lizzie: Well, why can't I do that?",
        "Phillip: Because you can't. Honey, because it's a surprise, all right. It's one that I worked really long and hard to give you. Let's just go.",
        "Lizzie: At least I'd like to know where we'll all end, you know. Because I just... it'll make me feel better.",
        "Phillip: We'll all... end up?",

        "Holly: Oh, where have I heard that before?",
        "Sebastian: If you just do as you're told.",
        "Holly: Just do as I'm told. I think you need to do some more research on me.",
        "Sebastian: What are you going to do, huh? Stage a jailbreak?? I already told you my staff is not for sale. You're here, Holly, until I get cured. Until Ed Bauer comes to save my life. Or not. So get used to it.",
        "Holly: You know what I just realized?",
        "Sebastian: What?",
        "Holly: You're a coward. That's what this all really about. You are sad and lonely because for some reason the only person you've been able to connect to was on his deathbed. And you are scared and you are terrified that you're going to die alone. Well, let me tell you something, no matter if I'm here...",

        "Olivia: I loved him. I loved him very much. But then he went crazy and disappeared with all our children.",
        "Jonathan: Phillip is just like your brother-in-law, Alfred. He's a bully. Messing with kids, taking them away from their homes. No child should ever have to be separated from its mother. That is a sin against everything that matters in this life.",

        "Rick: He didn't say anything. I thought I could get through to him, Beth, just like that old days, you know? I thought he could... would listen to me, but he just... he just doesn't care anymore.",

And he kept asking me over and over if I would go with him. Then he thought I was snooping around about the kids and he was just so disappointed. So I ran.",
