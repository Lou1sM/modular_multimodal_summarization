        "Radio Announcer: Okay, folks, it's a beautiful autumn day. My question: What are you doing with it? Skipping work to get in one last golf day or a walk along the beach? Is anybody living out there?",
        "Reva: I am. (Monitors beeping)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: How's she doing?",
        "Billy: Well, she's complaining.",
        "Cassie: That's a good sign.",
        "Billy: I've been waiting for the latest blood work, but I tell you, she's getting better by leaps and bounds.",
        "Josh: Reva?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: I will assume all of the duties of the office of the mayor, until Blake is ready to take her rightful place. And furthermore, I intend to honor all of the promises that both of us made during this campaign. It is my honor and now my duty to serve you, the people of Springfield. Thank you.",
        "Olivia: It is you. (Applause) I'd like to report an assault.",
        "Operator: Your name, please.",
        "Olivia: It doesn't matter what my name is, what matters is that I was assaulted.",
        "Operator: I'll need your name and time of the alleged attacked.",
        "Olivia: It wasn't alleged. It happened, I swear, and the man who was responsible is here. He needs to be arrested. Please. Hello? Is anybody there?",
        "Operator: Can you identify the man who attacked you?",
        "Olivia: Everybody can.",
        "Operator: You have witnesses?",
        "Olivia: No, that's not what I mean.",
        "Operator: Well, what do you mean, ma'am.",
        "Olivia: I was a kid and he ruined my life. He gets an award for that?",
        "Ditkins: Jeffrey's always been lucky.",
        "Olivia: Never mind. I'll take care of it myself.",
        "Crowd: O'Neill! O'Neill!",
        "(Applause)",
        "Jeffrey: Today all of Blake Marler's campaign promises become my promises. I will meet with her advisers and we will work, all of us, united, together.",
        "(Applause)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: We got the \"Springfield Burns\" guy, remember? It's Blake.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, so?",
        "Marina: So shouldn't we be searching the room or something? Trying to figure out who poisoned her?",
        "Mallet: Well, gee, I can't imagine who that would be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Monitors beeping)",
        "Dinah: My, my, my. Blakey, it's you. It's been you the whole time. You know, I couldn't quite believe it at first, but it's all making sense. It's making sense right here. You were always jealous of me and daddy, and how close we were. And you decided to come after me, didn't you? You decided to make those threats, to turn things around and come after me. Blake, let me tell you something. I can hate, too, and I can do it a hell of a lot better than you can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I don't want to...",
        "Josh: For once in your life can you just follow orders?",
        "Billy: Yes, I agree with my little brother here. It's time for you to take care of yourself.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, especially just until we find out how you really are.",
        "Reva: How I really am?",
        "Billy: Uh-huh.",
        "Reva: I'm suffocating. (Laughter) Now, if you'll excuse me, I want to get out of here before an orderly mistakenly takes my butt down to the morgue.",
        "Josh: Reva, Reva.",
        "Reva: Hi, Rick. What's up?",
        "Rick: I have your test results. (Monitors beeping) So, you know, when I got the blood work back, I was positive there was some sort of mistake. So I went back upstairs to check everything, and....",
        "Reva: It's bad news, isn't it?",
        "Rick: Well, I mean, sort of, because I'm not going to be able to see you every day. You're going home, Reva.",
        "Reva: I'm... I'm in remission?",
        "Rick: There's no sign of any cancer cells anywhere. But... but it's too soon to say the word \"remission.\" But your blood count, it looked really good, and this trip to Minnesota obviously paid off.",
        "Billy: Wait a minute. Dr. McCabe said that the bone marrow transplant didn't work. I mean, that he had done everything he could.",
        "Josh: And she had been so sick.",
        "Rick: Well, Reva's immune system was slow to respond, but it finally started to work. Only she was so weak, so depleted by then, we almost lost her anyway.",
        "Josh: So she was starting to get better when she was feeling worse.",
        "Rick: And we probably would have known something sooner had she not blown off the last couple of blood tests.",
        "Reva: I'm okay. The cancer's really gone?",
        "Rick: For now. I mean, there's always a chance of recurrence, Reva, but right now you're cancer free.",
        "Billy: Cancer-free, cancer- free. (Laughter)",
        "Reva: Did you guys really think I was going to die or something?",
        "Josh: Well, you were putting in a pretty first-rate good-bye performance there.",
        "Cassie: I have to call Tammy and R.J. and Jonathan.",
        "Josh: And Marah and Shayne, too.",
        "Reva: Let me do it myself, really, I mean, because I can, right, Rick? I can leave? I can go home?",
        "Rick: Well, I hate to spoil the party, everybody, but you're still in recovery. So unless you want to risk landing back here on your back...",
        "Reva: I do, I want to risk. I want do go outside. I want to breathe air, pollutants and all. I want to play in traffic. I want to drive another race car. I want to parachute out of an airplane and go see Shayne. But most of all, I want to see people look at me and think, \"Oh, hell, I thought she was dead.\" (Laughter)",
        "Rick: Reva, you're still very weak.",
        "Reva: Rick, I have been poked and prodded and chemoed and transplanted, and I survived. I'm still here. So if I was able to beat cancer and all the odds, then why shouldn't I risk... what's supposed to stop me from risking something that is the greatest thing of all and just live?",
        "Rick: Even if that lands you right back here in the bed?",
        "Reva: I'm not... I'm not going to get sicker. I'm not. I'll do whatever you say. I'll get a nurse. You tell me, you recommended some nurses. I'll get a nutritionist. I'll get a clown or a juggler, take all the pills you want me to take, just let me leave. Just tell me what I need to do.",
        "Rick: Okay. She has to be monitored 24/7.",
        "Reva: Hey, I'm right here. You can talk to me.",
        "Rick: You have to return back to Cedars for your regular check ups and your tests. All right? Now, you know, remission is not remission until after five years.",
        "Reva: Yeah, okay. So that's it, right? I can go?",
        "Rick: Yeah. I think I know when I'm licked. (Laughter)",
        "Reva: Thanks.",
        "Rick: I'm so happy for you.",
        "Reva: Thank you. Now go, would you go get my release papers?",
        "Rick: And you're leaving here in a wheelchair. Do you understand? I need a couple of signatures.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Reva: Go on, guys, get him what he needs. Oh, man. I'm taking these things off. (Laughter) Sis, help me get dressed. I'm going home.",
        "Cassie: Yes, you are.",
        "Rick: I just need you guys to fill out these forms here. It's just billing information and, you know, where Reva lives.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: I'd like to know why. You see, because I found a wonderful guy who I love. Loved very much. And he loved me back. And we were getting married and everything was set and then suddenly, you release these twisted greeting cards on the internet. You come after me. So you destroy what could have been the one true love of my life. And I don't understand you. You know what, Blake? You deserve to be here and you deserve to die. Oh, you can hear me. Good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Applause)",
        "Jeffrey: The final tally... the count was so close because Blake Marler and I were never really far apart on the issues. We both believe in old-fashioned virtues, such as honesty, integrity and hard work. And even though I'm only filling in for Ms. Marler while she recuperates from her sudden affliction, keeping her seat warm...",
        "Mallet: \"Affliction.\" \"Affliction\", that's an interesting choice of words.",
        "Marina: Okay, all right. We all know that you don't like Jeffrey because he and Dinah...",
        "Mallet: No, no, no, it's not personal. No, no, it's police work and it's obvious. Blake wins the election, then she becomes deathly ill and wow, look who's the last man standing?",
        "Marina: I don't know. I feel like it's something else. Intuition. (Cell phone ringing) Detective Cooper. Is she awake? All right. I'll tell him. Thanks.",
        "Mallet: Is that about Blake?",
        "Marina: Yeah, they've raised her condition from critical to serious, but she's still not up. Want to head over and see if she wakes up?",
        "Mallet: You go. I'll catch up with you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: I am truly humbled by the responsibility that has been suddenly given to me, and I promise that I will work hard to earn the peoples' trust. Especially those people who did not vote for me, because let's face it, without trust, what is there? If those in power feel free to trample on those rights of those that are weaker... weaker... weaker. I intend to earn the privilege of representing you, and I give you my word as the former district attorney and as your new interim mayor, that although we may not always agree, I will do my best and I will not disappoint you. (Applause) I'm sure there are a lot of questions, and I'm going to do my best to answer those. So yes, Ms. Spencer, what can I do for you?",
        "Olivia: You already did it.",
        "Jeffrey: Excuse me?",
        "Olivia: I have something to tell you. Something everyone should know about the real Jeffrey O'Neill.",
        "Jeffrey: Sorry to disappoint you Ms. Spencer, but I am indeed the real O'Neill. If someone told you otherwise...",
        "Olivia: No, I know who you are and what you are. Everything you have tried to hide from the public.",
        "Jeffrey: Did I forget to pay my bill at the Beacon? Okay, you got me. I made off with one of those soft, fluffy terrycloth...",
        "Olivia: You took something much more precious than that.",
        "Jeffrey: Did I take a little bar of soap?",
        "Olivia: Shut up. Just shut up.",
        "Jeffrey: It's okay, it's okay.",
        "Olivia: You have no idea who this man is. This man you didn't elect to become mayor. Behind that smiling politician's face is another face, a face he doesn't want you to see.",
        "Mallet: Excuse me, O'Neill, we need you over here. Come with me.",
        "Olivia: I'm not... I'm not finished. No. Please, he hurt me.",
        "Buzz: Hey. What? I... it's me. I've been looking all over for you.",
        "Olivia: It's too late, Buzz. You're too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Thanks for getting me out of there. I don't know what's going on with her. So what is it? This better be good. I've got some duties to...",
        "Mallet: Yeah, right, Blake's duties.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, Blake is...",
        "Mallet: Yeah, Blake's the Mayor.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I'm filling in for Blake while she recovers.",
        "Mallet: From her \"affliction\"?",
        "Jeffrey: Is this going somewhere, Detective?",
        "Mallet: Oh, you know it. You know it. Right to the top for you.",
        "Jeffrey: Look, if you think that I wanted to assume this position with Blake collapsing from exhaustion...",
        "Mallet: It wasn't exhaustion. It was poison. And look at you here, dancing on her grave.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Monitor beeping)",
        "Dinah: You're not going to have a heart attack. You'd have to have a heart for that. Relax. So why does someone like you do get away with what you do? You know, why do you hurt people? Because you're hurting? Because life is unfair? Because you lost your husband? (Monitor beeping faster) Oh. I'm sorry. Why don't you join the club, Blakey, you miserable bitch?",
        "Marina: Dinah, what are you doing? (Monitor beeping faster)",
        "Dinah: I'm sorry. You just... you need to get a nurse. You need to get a nurse. You need to get some help right away, please. Get some help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: So I'm going to let Reva check out, but just so I'm clear here, Reva has... she has... she hasn't beaten cancer, she's arrested it. Okay? It could still come back.",
        "Billy: She's beaten the odds all the other times in her life. Why should this be any different?",
        "Rick: All right, let me see. Take a look at this. Okay. Everything seems to be in order. Josh, you need to put Reva's address here.",
        "Billy: She'll be staying in the cabin.",
        "Rick: Okay. All right. That sounds good. I'll get the release papers. I'll be right back.",
        "Billy: You can say it. You think she should be with you, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: We could fix up the room on the ground floor, so you would haven't to negotiate the stairs.",
        "Reva: I'm not living with you.",
        "Cassie: Okay. I'm not going to fight you on this. I'm just trying to go what's right for you.",
        "Reva: When did that become your priority? Was it after the first time you kissed Josh, or after the first time you slept with him?",
        "Cassie: Here it comes.",
        "Reva: Look, Cassie, in my wildest dreams, I could almost expect to see Josh with Olivia. But never with you. I can even understand you filling in for me on the Veteran's project, but not the rest of it.",
        "Cassie: If we get into this right now, you're just going to get sick all over again.",
        "Reva: Or you will. What do you think mama would say about this?",
        "Cassie: What did she say when you married Billy or H.B.? You know what? I'm sorry. I don't mean to....",
        "Reva: No, it's good. This is good. Please. You said it. At least we're getting somewhere. I love you Cassie, and I think that's what hurt the most, was that I couldn't hate you. And I still can't.",
        "Cassie: You're too weak for this conversation right now. Just the reality...",
        "Reva: The reality? My reality is that I was dead, and now I'm alive. And my whole world is turned upside down.",
        "Cassie: Well, mine is, too. Okay? I just... for now I just want to know where you want to live.",
        "Reva: No, you want to know where I stand.",
        "Cassie: Well, is that wrong?",
        "Reva: I don't know. I don't know. I'm just learning to breathe again. I haven't even been outside this hospital room.",
        "Josh: What's going on?",
        "Reva: Nothing.",
        "Cassie: We're going to need another minute.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gina Tognoni, \"Inside The Light.\" In daytime we talk to ourselves. You know, talk when we walk or in the room when we're by ourselves. But apparently a lot of people talk to themselves. (Laughs) Yes, Gina talks to herself when she walks the streets in New York. I mean, I think it's just something like, you know, living in the city, you know, you just talk out loud. It's actually quite normal, you know, but... my friends tell me I'm a little strange when they see me talking to myself. See Dinah, Wednesday, November 15, \"Inside The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: I'm sorry. Did you want to be the one to do this?",
        "Josh: No, not at all. Looks like you've got that under control.",
        "Billy: I certainly do, Ollie.",
        "Josh: So do you think that this is... do you think Reva's ready to get out of here?",
        "Billy: No. But what's the difference? It's kind of delaying the inevitable, isn't it?",
        "Josh: Yeah. You know, if you think of me and Reva as the inevitable...",
        "Billy: Actually, I don't. I think that's past. I mean, I think you had a hell of a run and I don't say that to be mean. I mean, you and Reva, it doesn't get any realer than that. But when she got sick, I was the man she turned to.",
        "Josh: Yeah, and you were also supposed to be the man that would tell her husband, your brother, that she was dying of cancer. That way she might have been able to turn to both of us.",
        "Billy: Wasn't my call. I didn't want to betray her.",
        "Josh: So instead you betrayed me.",
        "Billy: Look, let's deal with what's right in front of us here, okay? What she needs, Reva needs care, and she needs attention, not somebody who's being pulled between her and her sister. So, if you want to have it out about this right now, let's do it. Whatever you want.",
        "Josh: I just want what's best for Reva.",
        "Billy: You're looking at him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: So what do you suggest we do? Find a big old mud puddle and wrestle for him? Best two out of three?",
        "Cassie: No, because I would win.",
        "Reva: You think?",
        "Cassie: Reva, I'm at least twice as strong as you are right now.",
        "Reva: But I play dirty.",
        "Cassie: What are we even talking about? Reva, why do you always have to make everything just so over the top? You're alive. We love the same man.",
        "Reva: You want to be civilized? We'll be civilized. Tea and scones and Josh. Pass my husband, please. So, Cassie, darling, how do you think of him? He is delicious, isn't he? Here, have some more.",
        "Cassie: Reva, do you want to come home with me or not?",
        "Reva: What are you really offering me, Cassie? Are you going to walk out that door and tell Josh that it's over? Are you offering to give him up? I didn't think so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: You know, I got an idea. Let's be cheap. Let's re-gift these and bring them to Blake's...",
        "Olivia: I can't. I have to go. I have to do something.",
        "Buzz: What? What could be so... come on. Have dinner with me.",
        "Olivia: Buzz, stop!",
        "Buzz: Stop what? Stop missing you, stop caring about you, stop...?",
        "Olivia: Yes.",
        "Buzz: Hey. I know what it's like to have your past catch up with you.",
        "Olivia: You don't know anything about this.",
        "Buzz: I know. If Ava finds her father, then you're going to have to face it. You're going to have to face the man that took advantage of you, the man that got you pregnant and you're just going to have to deal with it.",
        "Olivia: What I should have dealt with it back then.",
        "Buzz: What? You're going to kill him or maybe you're going to forgive him? People change.",
        "Olivia: No. People don't just get to change. You don't get to put on a new face and move on with your life.",
        "Buzz: I did.",
        "Olivia: If you knew how much this hurts.",
        "Buzz: What do you want?",
        "Olivia: Something you can't give me. Something I have to get for myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: You know, it's a good thing I'm a lawyer, otherwise I'd have to hire one to sue you for harassment.",
        "Mallet: You'd lose.",
        "Jeffrey: Do you think that I would really poison Blake for this temporary position?",
        "Mallet: It's not temporary if she dies.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, look, you know, Blake and I were a lot more than just political opponents. We were... we were close for a while.",
        "Mallet: So maybe it's a crime of passion.",
        "Jeffrey: The only crime I committed was sleeping with your girlfriend. You couldn't get me for that, so now you're trying to pin something else on me.",
        "Mallet: If Blake doesn't make it, someone's going down for murder. And my money's on you.",
        "Jeffrey: You still need a motive.",
        "Mallet: Did I forget to mention that we found the blogger? Remember that guy that was writing all that nasty stuff about you on the internet? Well, only the guy wasn't a guy. It was Blake.",
        "Jeffrey: (Laughs) I don't believe it.",
        "Mallet: \"Springfield Burns\" was Blake's little baby. Remy and Marina just found proof of that on her computer.",
        "Jeffrey: What kind of proof? Were there some... some new things on that there that haven't been released yet?",
        "Mallet: It's good. It's good. You seem surprised. I'll have to give you that. Of course, a man of your training could seem to be almost anything. Maybe, maybe you found out she was the blogger before we did. Add that to the fact that she just beat you fair and square in an election and... can you spell \"motive\"?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: It's very touching how concerned you are about Blake.",
        "Dinah: She's family.",
        "Marina: Hmm-hmm. So when you call someone \"a miserable bitch,\" is that a term of endearment? You know, like in a rap song?",
        "Dinah: You heard that?",
        "Marina: Yeah.",
        "Dinah: Well, you caught me. No, I did not come to weep at her bedside.",
        "Marina: Just to finish the job?",
        "Dinah: Job?",
        "Marina: The poison.",
        "Dinah: Poison, what are you talking about? Who would poison her?",
        "Marina: Oh, someone who might have some reason to hate her. You know how cops are. We always look at the family first.",
        "Dinah: Look, Blake and I are not very close, but I would never do anything like that.",
        "Marina: You're angry at her.",
        "Dinah: Half the town was nailed by her stupid web site.",
        "Marina: Who told you Blake was behind \"Springfield Burns\"?",
        "Dinah: Everybody knows about that, don't they?",
        "Marina: No. In fact, very few people know.",
        "Dinah: Come on. Those nurses in there, they were whispering about it earlier. So if this was supposed to be some stupid big police cover up, you've got a leak, Marina.",
        "Marina: Guess so.",
        "Dinah: All right. You know what? I can see that you need some time to think about this. When you crack the case, give me a call.",
        "Marina: Of course. Dinah, you'll be the first to know. You know how concerned you are about your step-mommy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Where are those security tapes? I had everything organized before I got here. Hey, slacker.",
        "Haines: Oh, hey, Cooper. This new station's pretty cool, huh?",
        "Marina: Yeah, it's great. You know where I might find those security tapes from the Beacon? I had planned a rush before we got here.",
        "Haines: Take a pick.",
        "Marina: Well, I would like one from outside Blake's hotel room from today, if possible. Thanks. Are you sure this is even from today?",
        "Haines: I'm positive. Here. You can switch to fast forward.",
        "Marina: Thanks. Oh, my God. That's it. You know, my job would be a whole lot tougher if the bad guys weren't so dumb.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: What's the emergency?",
        "Marina: Mallet, get over here.",
        "Mallet: What? You didn't call me in to see a tape, did you? I had O'Neill dancing. Come on. Could this have waited?",
        "Marina: No, no, no, forget Jeffrey O'Neill, please. Now, this is the hallway outside Blake's bedroom just moments before she was poisoned.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, okay, the empty hallway.",
        "Marina: No. Wait for it. There.",
        "Mallet: Right. Dinah's sneaking into her step mother's room. Okay, what does that prove?",
        "Marina: Okay. Now, this is Dinah going into Blake's room. What's in her hands?",
        "Mallet: Nothing?",
        "Marina: Right. Now, if we just fast forward it a little bit here we'll have Dinah leaving Blake's bedroom. What's in her hands?",
        "Mallet: Papers?",
        "Marina: Right. But not just any papers; \"Springfield Burns\" papers. The new adventures of Dinah and Mallet. Just zoom in here, we can take a look at her face. Oh, what's that expression?",
        "Mallet: She's not happy.",
        "Marina: Right. Not happy. Because she just found out who the identity of the \"Springfield Burns\" blogger is. She knew before any of us, Mallet. So you tell me, what's a gal like Dinah do with information like that? Hey, no one's seen that tape except you, me and Detective Haines. He went home for the day. His shift's over, so I can sit on this tape for a few hours if you want me to. It's your call.",

        "Buzz: This is not where you tell me you're too good for me or I'm too good for you or you're too busy or you're too bored or I'm not in your league...",
        "Olivia: Oh gosh, can we end this, please?",
        "Buzz: No, we can't. We can't. You know, if you need your space, fine. You got it. You want to be yourself, no apologies, done. But you can use this thing with Ava looking for a father to push me away, no way. So you just got to be straight with me. Tell me what the hell's going on. Maybe I can fix it.",
        "Olivia: For all your heart and soul, you can't fix it.",
        "Buzz: Try me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: So, thank you all for coming down here. I'm sorry I have to go now. There's a crisis at city hall. Excuse me.",

        "Billy: Hey.",
        "Reva: No. I am not an invalid.",
        "Rick: A deal's a deal. (All speaking at once)",
        "Reva: My senses are so alive. You're all doctors, but I'll tell you something, once I get out of here...",
        "Rick: Once you get out of here, you have to be twice as careful...",
        "Reva: I'm going to be twice as careful.",
        "Rick: ...You'll not miss a pill or miss an appointment.",
        "Cassie: She won't.",
        "Josh: Believe me, she's going to get more care and attention than she can stand.",
        "Billy: We'll even tie her down to the bed if we have to.",
        "Reva: Oh, in your dreams, Billy Lewis.",
        "Rick: All right, you're all set to go. Cassie's got the instructions. Stay well.",

        "Rick: You got it.",
        "Reva: Well, I guess I've been a real pain in the ass, haven't I?",
        "Josh: So what else is new?",
        "Reva: Well, I have been bitching and moaning. And I almost forgot to say thank you, all of you, so much. I thought that I was doing this great thing by sparing you all my suffering, but in the end it was my family who spared me by refusing to leave my side, by dragging me back from the brink. I just want to say that it was probably the damn craziest idea I've ever heard in my life, but I'm here because of it and I love you all so much. I love you. So now I'm ready to go home. So get me out of this place, because home for me is Cross Creek. Cross creek, right here in Springfield.",
        "Billy: You heard the lady. Okay. Let's blow this pop stand. I got the little red sports car.",
        "Reva: Is the top down?",
        "Billy: Well, no.",
        "Reva: Put the top down or I'll take a cab. See ya! Wait, Billy, wait. I never thought I'd see the outdoors again. The world just kept on living, didn't it?",
        "Billy: Yeah, I think it's pretty cheeky of it, don't you?",
        "Reva: I'm alive, Billy. I'm alive.",
        "Billy: So amazing.",
        "Reva: Can we take the long way home?",
        "Billy: Yeah.",
        "Reva: You know, that night after my party, on the way to the party, I drove, I made this loop, you know, I said good-bye to all my favorite places. Now I'd kind of like to go back to all those places and say hello again and let them know I'm still here.",
        "Billy: Yeah, let's do it.",
        "Cassie: Josh?",
        "Josh: Let's go home.",

        "Olivia: Crisis at city hall, huh?",
        "Jeffrey: There are some documents here that I need, not that it's any of your business.",
        "Olivia: Just like the secrets that Blake has on you are none of her business. Only if you find them before the police do...",
        "Jeffrey: What do you want? You've been hounding me all day. Like it or not, I am the new mayor, so I have a job to do.",
        "Olivia: I haven't forgotten who you are. Or how good you are at saving yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Wow. We did it.",
        "Billy: Yeah. Is that a good \"wow\" or a bad \"wow?\"",
        "Reva: Well, it's just different, you know? You did all this?",
        "Billy: I had a little help but it's okay, isn't it?",
        "Reva: Yeah, it's nice. New things for a new life.",
        "Billy: Yeah, that's kind of what I thought, you know? Hey, I'll tell you what, let me go get that cup of tea you wanted.",
        "Reva: Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: You know what, I could use a glass of wine. How about you?",
        "Cassie: Please. Make it a big glass.",

        "Cassie: Are you sorry that you didn't get to bring her home?",

        "Billy: Hey, you okay?",
        "Reva: Yeah. You know, it's just that... I said good-bye to the night and the day, to the moon and the sun, to pop and the kids and to you. I was ready. I guess you're never really ready, though. I mean, why would you be ready to leave all of this?",
        "Billy: Welcome home, darling.",
        "Reva: Home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: This is home, Cassie. This is where I belong.",
        "Cassie: Is it, Josh? What if the only thing that brought us together and kept us together was Reva? I mean, she was so sure she was going to die and she just didn't want you to be alone and so she orchestrated everything.",
        "Josh: Cassie. What we have is ours. Reva didn't create it; she can't take it away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: You're really worried I'm going to fall over, aren't you?",
        "Billy: Darling, I'm so used to picking you off the floor I guess I don't feel normal unless I'm holding you.",
        "Reva: Did you happen to pick up that the calendar that I put in the trash?",
        "Billy: No.",
        "Reva: I need to get a new one, because I need to mark down all of the holidays again, birthdays and ordinary days.",
        "Billy: We'll fill them all with bebop and barbecue?",
        "Reva: Bebop?",
        "Billy: Okay, hip hop. Hey, whatever. You got your life back and I'm going to see to it that every day is worth living.",

        "Cassie: Cheers. Now get out.",
        "Billy: Could it be that you are waiting for this guy?",
        "Dinah: Are you accusing me of killing Blake?",
        "Remy: Blake wasn't supposed to get the poison drink.",
        "Jeffrey: I guess I owe you one.",
