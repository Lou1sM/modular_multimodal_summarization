        "Tony: Okay, you know what? Listen, Michelle, \r\nwe've been to every single rum place this side of Havana. We've come up empty \r\nevery time. She's not here. Let's go. ",
        "Michelle: No, no. No, no. The bartender at \r\nthe hotel said Aurelia and the other maids like to come here to dance after \r\nhours. ",
        "Tony: So? So she wouldn't tell us where \r\nSebastian was earlier. What makes you think she's going to tell us now? \n",
        "Michelle: Because all she needs is a little \r\nfriendly persuasion. ",
        "Tony: Oh, well, I'm not feeling very friendly \r\nat the so... ",
        "Michelle: Oh, come on, Tony. You can get her \r\nto come clean. I know you can. ",
        "Tony: Okay, hold on a second. Why me? Why not \r\nyou? ",
        "Michelle: Because you're the one she's got \r\nthe hots for. ",
        "Tony: (Laughs) yeah. Okay. ",
        "Michelle: You didn't notice the way she was \r\nlooking at you? ",
        "Tony: No, I don't think so. ",
        "Michelle: Look, trust me. A plain girl like \r\nAurelia, she's just going to die for attention. So you're going to give it to \r\nher to get the information that we need, okay? There, that's better. Would you \r\nstay if I said, \"don't go...\"",

        "Lizzie: He's gone. He's not coming back.\r\n",
        "Coop: Yeah, with my nephews. ",
        "Lizzie: Those are my little brothers and my \r\nlittle sister. It's all my fault. I screwed everything up. ",
        "Coop: Lizzie, there are four missing children \r\nright now. Their mothers are absolutely crazy. But you know what? Why not, let's \r\njust make this all about your suffering at this time. ",
        "Lizzie: Do you think I didn't try to find out \r\nwhere those kids are? When I was with my dad, I begged him to tell me. And you \r\nknow what? And I would probably be the only person he'd tell, and I messed that \r\nup. ",
        "Coop: If you hadn't ditched me, I would have \r\nbeaten it out of him. ",
        "Lizzie: You make everything worse. \r\nEverything. ",
        "Coop: Me? I make it worse? ",
        "Lizzie: You know what? You work for me. \r\nEither you help me or leave.",

        "Alan: Well, son, you've come home. \n",
        "Phillip: I'm not staying. ",
        "Alan: Listen, you know it's not too late to \r\nturn this situation around, Phillip. Why don't you let me help you. ",
        "Phillip: There's no need. I have everything \r\nunder control. ",
        "Alan: Are you here to get Elizabeth? She \r\ndoesn't want to go with you, Phillip. ",
        "Phillip: Lizzie's going to be reunited with \r\nher sister and her brothers. They're her family. ",
        "Alan: Those children need to be with their \r\nmothers. ",
        "Phillip: No, those children need to be \r\nprotected from their mothers, and that's my duty as their father. ",
        "Alan: You're not Jude's father. And you had \r\nno right to take Rick's son. ",
        "Phillip: Rick understands. Jude needs to be \r\nwith his brother. ",
        "Alan: Why don't you let me help you with this \r\nbefore it gets any worse than it already is. ",
        "Phillip: I told you there is no need for your \r\nhelp. I have everything taken care of. ",
        "Alan: All right, then tell me where the \r\nchildren are. You know you can trust your father. Look, I understand, Phillip, \r\nwhat you're doing. ",
        "Phillip: Oh, I know, dad. I know you \r\nunderstand. Because you're the one that taught me how to be a Spaulding. That \r\nour children are our future and they have to be protected. And that's what I'm \r\ndoing. I'm protecting our children and our future. Now if you'll excuse me, I \r\nhave to go. ",
        "Alan: No. I need you to stay here, Phillip.",
        "\r\n************************",
        "Harley: I can't just sit around when I have \r\nno idea where my babies are. They must be so scared. I've never left them \r\nwithout saying good-bye before. They have to know something's wrong. ",
        "Gus: Honey, we're going to find them, okay? \r\nFrank's got the whole force out there looking for all the children. We're going \r\nto find them. We'll bring Phillip in and we'll make him break. He will tell us \r\nwhere they are. ",
        "Harley: Don't do that. Don't say things just \r\nbecause you think it's what I want to hear. ",
        "Gus: I love those kids, you know. I mean, \r\nthey're like my own. I was there when Jude took his first breath. I helped \r\ndeliver him. I was right by your side when Phillip tried to get custody of Zach.\r\n",
        "Harley: Well, that was before you found out \r\nyou were a Spaulding. ",
        "Gus: Honey, I love those boys like they are \r\nmy own sons. ",
        "Harley: They're not. (Phone rings) \n",
        "Gus: Yeah. ",
        "Alan: Gus, Phillip is back. I have him here \r\nat the house with me. ",
        "Gus: Okay, I'm on my way. That was Alan.\r\n",
        "Harley: Oh, thank God. ",
        "Gus: Phillip's at the house right now, all \r\nright. ",
        "Harley: Wait, wait, wait. Frank, it's me. \r\nWe've located Phillip. I want the Spaulding house surrounded. But don't go \r\ninside. Don't let anybody inside. If Phillip does talk, he's not doing it to the \r\ncops.",
        "\r\n**************************",
        "Phillip: You turned me in. ",
        "Alan: It was your brother. I want to help \r\nyou, Phillip. But we've got to do this together as a family. Now if you're going \r\nto leave, you're going to have to go through me. ",
        "Phillip: All right, let them come. I'm ready.",
        "\r\n**********************************",
        "Contractor: Danny Santos, right? ",
        "Danny: Who's asking? ",
        "Contractor: I work for your wife and the \r\nother Mr. Santos. I need answers before I move on the lighthouse project. \n",
        "Danny: Well, sorry. I wish I could help you. \r\nBut my wife and the other Mr. Santos are out of town, and I have no idea when \r\nthey'll be back. ",
        "Constructor: Give a message when you see her.\r\n",
        "Danny: Sure. ",
        "Constructor: I quit. ",
        "Marina: Danny, Danny, I am so sorry. \n",
        "Danny: Why? What are you sorry about? \n",
        "Marina: I'm complaining about my family \r\nand... ",
        "Danny: Oh, come on. Hey. In case you hadn't \r\nheard, Michelle left town with Tony. But life goes on, right?",
        "\r\n****************************",
        "Tony: Thank you. ",
        "Michelle: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Tony: You know, you make a lousy pimp. \r\n(Laughs) ",
        "Michelle: Look, you're going to have Aurelia \r\neating out of the palm of your hands. I mean, really, look at the girl. You just \r\ntake her out on the dance floor, spin her around a little, give her the eyes, \r\nflash her the smile, and she's going to lead us to Sebastian in no time. All \r\nright? ",
        "Tony: I'm not for sale. ",
        "Michelle: I didn't say you had to sleep with \r\nthe girl. Just loosen her up with a few mojitos. ",
        "Tony: What's wrong with the direct approach, \r\nhuh? ",
        "Michelle: Because you saw her in the hotel. \r\nShe'll clam up under interrogation. ",
        "Tony: Okay, well, you know what? I'm not \r\ncomfortable doing this. ",
        "Michelle: Look, look... ",
        "Tony: I'm, sorry. I'm not... ",
        "Michelle: Think about it, you're like doing \r\nthe girl a favor. You're helping her come out of her shell a little bit, right?\r\n",
        "Tony: Okay. I can handle that.",
        "\r\n*******************************",
        "Alan: Phillip, I'm on your side, yours and \r\nthe children. ",
        "Phillip: Well, that's what you always told \r\nme, Dad. It's us against the world. ",
        "Alan: And your children have a right to enjoy \r\nthe future that you have envisioned for them. Look at that model of Springfield \r\nthat you have. ",
        "Phillip: I'm afraid that's going to have to \r\nwait. ",
        "Alan: But why? It's a magnificent future for \r\nthese kids. This is a wonderful city to grow up in. Well I can just see Emma, \r\nJames and Zach standing beside you when you cut the ribbon to that new commerce \r\ncenter there. And then Elizabeth giving the opening address at the new Spaulding \r\nStadium at the university. Boy, do I like the name on that stadium. And those \r\nkids will be so proud to see their family name up there. Now bring them home, \r\nson. They need to be here with us. ",
        "Phillip: I wish I could. But dreams change, \r\nDad. I had to accept that. And you have to accept it, too. But don't worry, I've \r\nmade sure that our enemies won't win. The Spaulding family will come out of this \r\nstronger than ever. ",
        "Alan: Look, you just leave the enemies to me. \r\nI will take care of them like I always have. Tell me where the children are and \r\nI will bring them home, okay? ",
        "Phillip: Isn't it ironic, Dad. I finally have \r\nbecome everything you ever wanted me to be, and you can't stomach it. \n",
        "Alan: I only wanted the best for you, \r\nPhillip. Because I love you. This isn't the way.",
        "Harley: Where are they? ",
        "Phillip: I knew you'd come. ",
        "Harley: You tell me where my boys are--now.",

        "Tony: (Speaking in Spanish) ",
        "Aurelia: Gracias, Antonio. ",
        "Tony: De nada. (Laughs) ",
        "Aurelia: Your sister doesn't speak Spanish. \r\nAnd she doesn't look anything like you. ",
        "Michelle: You don't think so? Come on. \n",
        "Tony: She's my step-sister through marriage.\r\n",
        "Aurelia: Aye, that explains it. ",
        "Tony: Yes, yes. ",
        "Michelle: All right, drink up. ",
        "Michelle: Thanks. ",
        "Tony: Where's your? No. ",
        "Michelle: I'll get one. ",
        "Tony: Well, to new friends. ",
        "Aurelia: New friends. ",
        "Michelle: I like this place. This place is \r\nnice, it's cool. ",
        "Tony: Stop. ",
        "Michelle: Does Sebastian Hulce ever come \r\nhere? ",
        "Tony: Stop it. ",
        "Aurelia: I can't say. Mr. Hulce is a private \r\nman, a very dangerous man. And I'd hate to have anything bad happen to you.\r\n",
        "Tony: Hmm. ",
        "Aurelia: (Laughs) ",
        "Tony: All right. Well, you know what? Let's \r\nforget about Sebastian. Let's dance. You want to dance? ",
        "Aurelia: I'd like that. ",
        "Tony: There you go, sis. Take hers. We're \r\ngoing to dance. See you in a few. ",
        "Michelle: Yeah. Have fun.",
        "\r\n********************************",
        "Coop: If I was so afraid that your looney-tune \r\nfather was going to show up here and just drag you off, I would be out of here \r\nso fast, right now. ",
        "Lizzie: You know what? That's your family \r\nfault. They pushed him to do that. ",
        "Coop: The Cooper's, we forced him to kidnap \r\nthe kids? Oh, that makes a lot of sense, Lizzie. ",
        "Lizzie: I am so sick and tired of Coopers. \r\nYou guys always make it out like you guys are the victims, when in reality \r\nyou're the bullies. You beat up my Uncle Gus when you first got in town! \n",
        "Coop: After what he did to my sister Harley, \r\nhe's lucky that's all I did to him. ",
        "Lizzie: What did I do to you? You've had it \r\nin for me since the second you got here. ",
        "Coop: You just keep proving me right each \r\nstep of the way, Lizzie. ",
        "Lizzie: What about you? You drove a bulldozer \r\nthrough my house and everyone was inside of it. ",
        "Coop: I just evened up the score, that's all.\r\n",
        "Lizzie: Well, you know what? That's what my \r\ndad would say to you. Paybacks go both ways. ",
        "Coop: Payback? You want to talk about \r\npayback? Payback? He just kidnapped four innocent kids. That's payback? \n",
        "Lizzie: Get out of here. Leave. ",
        "Coop: You know what? ",
        "Lizzie: Bye, go, now! ",
        "Coop: You got it. You got it! Here are the \r\nkeys. Drive yourself home, Lizzie. Have fun. ",
        "Lizzie: Coop, I told you to leave. Who are \r\nyou?",
        "\r\n*******************************",
        "Phillip: Shoot me, Harley. Go ahead. \n",
        "Harley: One leg at a time until you tell me \r\nwhere Zach and Jude are. ",
        "Gus: Harley, this isn't the way. ",
        "Harley: You get away from me! ",
        "Phillip: Don't worry, Gus. You're not going \r\nto shoot me. ",
        "Harley: Where are my boys? ",
        "Gus: Honey, don't do this. ",
        "Harley: You're a monster. Zach and Jude are \r\nmy babies. They need their mother. ",
        "Alan: Harley, we all want to do the right \r\nthing, but you will never get away with this. ",
        "Gus: If you do this, you're not going to see \r\nyour boys again. You hear me? Just give me the gun, okay? ",
        "Harley: (Crying) where are they? ",
        "Phillip: Where you'll never find them. \n",
        "Harley: Why? Why are you doing this? \n",
        "Phillip: Because I have to protect them from \r\ntheir well- meaning, but woefully misguided mothers. ",
        "Gus: Phil, look, we're all family here, \r\nright? Nobody ever wanted... ",
        "Phillip: Oh, don't patronize me! I know what \r\nyou think. I know what you all think. Even you, Dad. You think I don't hear the \r\nwhispers and see the stares? I see them. I see all of it. But it doesn't keep me \r\nup at night. Not anymore. Because now I know what I have to do. Unlike you, my \r\nbrother, who have never been able to figure out which side you're on. \n",
        "Gus: Well, I'm very clear right now. Why \r\ndon't you just tell us where the children, okay? Otherwise they're just going to \r\narrest you, Phil, arrest you and put you in jail. ",
        "Phillip: Put me in jail. Then I'll just rot, \r\nand you'll never find any of the kids. ",
        "Gus: Phil? Just... what do you need? What do \r\nyou want us to give you, you know, so it all ends just well for everyone. \n",
        "Phillip: I think I want to be alone with \r\nHarley. ",
        "Gus: I don't want to leave you in here with \r\nhim alone. ",
        "Harley: I can handle this. ",
        "Phillip: You heard her. You may as well take \r\nthe gun with you. ",
        "Alan: Phillip, listen to her. You can work \r\nthis out. ",
        "Gus: Coop? Coop? ",
        "Harley: Go, I got it. ",
        "Gus: If you hurt her, I'll make sure that you \r\ndon't get out of here alive. I don't need you to find the kids. I'll be outside, \r\nokay? ",
        "Phillip: I guess you do want to hurt me. Did \r\nyou ever think in a million years that this is where we would end up? \n",
        "Harley: Just tell me that the boys are safe.\r\n",
        "Phillip: Oh, Harley. How can you even ask me \r\nthat? You know that I love them as much you do. You know I would never let \r\nanything happen to them. ",
        "Harley: I know. I know. I was thinking before \r\nabout our first night alone with Zach, the first night that we brought him home \r\nfrom the hospital. He was so tiny and sweet smelling. We were afraid he'd stop \r\nbreathing if we weren't watching. ",
        "Phillip: My son had just been born and I \r\nthought my father was dying. ",
        "Harley: Yes. And we stayed with him all \r\nnight. We put him in the bed between us, watching him and promising him that we \r\nwould always be there to love him. You can't have forgotten all that, Phillip.\r\n",
        "Phillip: No. I haven't forgotten \r\nanything--none of it.",

        "Belkin: Just come with me quietly. \n",
        "Lizzie: I'm not going with you. I'm not going \r\nwith you. ",
        "Belkin: Take it easy. I'm not going to hurt \r\nyou. ",
        "Lizzie: No, you're not. I'm not going \r\nanywhere. No! Help! Coop! ",
        "Coop: Hey. Get your hands off her, man!",
        "\r\n*************************************",
        "Phillip: You know, I remember. I remember the \r\nfirst time that we brought Zach into a room full of Cooper's and Spaulding's. Do \r\nyou remember? It was just like in that moment... for just that moment he made us \r\na family. ",
        "Harley: Yes. Yes. And we can be that again. \r\nAll you have to do is bring little Zach home. And we can... we can work things \r\nout. Getting along, being friends at least. ",
        "Phillip: Harley, that train left the station \r\na long time ago. ",
        "Harley: No. ",
        "Phillip: Yes. Damn it, I tried. I tried so \r\nhard when we were married. But things just kept falling apart because I'm not \r\nperfect. I'm a human being. I make mistakes. And I couldn't live up to your \r\nimpossibly high standards. ",
        "Harley: I'm so sorry that things fell apart \r\nbetween us. But Phillip, we have... we have this wonderful little boy who needs \r\nthe love of both his parents. We grew up with only one parent. I don't want that \r\nfor Zach. I know you don't, either. ",
        "Phillip: No, I don't. But what I really don't \r\nwant for him is we're having... I don't want him to grow up trying to jump \r\nthrough hoops to meet your demands for perfection. No child should have to \r\nsuffer through that. ",
        "Harley: Zach is not suffering. I promise.\r\n",
        "Phillip: All of the mothers of my children \r\nhave victimized them because they're self-involved and they try to isolate them \r\nand separate them from their father. ",
        "Harley: Phillip, that's just not true. \n",
        "Phillip: See, you all are the ones who have \r\ndone this. You've forced me to this. ",
        "Harley: How can you deny your children the \r\nlove and care of their mothers? ",
        "Phillip: But what about their fathers? See \r\nyou... none of you... none of you think that that matters. What about a father's \r\nlove? And that's what I'm going to give them. I'm going to give them a father's \r\nunconditional love. ",
        "Harley: Like you got from your father? I'm \r\nsorry. I... I... just tell me what you want. Tell me what you want. (Sobbing) \r\nI'll do anything. I'll do anything to get the boys back. ",
        "Phillip: You know there is one thing that \r\nI've always wanted from you. ",
        "Harley: This is all just some game to you, \r\nisn't it? ",
        "Phillip: No, Harley, I've never been more \r\nserious in my life. This is for you. ",
        "Harley: What is it? ",
        "Phillip: It will help you find the boys.\r\n",
        "Harley: Thank you. ",
        "Phillip: We had a deal. ",
        "Harley: Yes, yes. Anything. Yes. ",
        "Phillip: How much do you want this paper? \r\nWould you beg me for it? ",
        "Harley: Beg you? ",
        "Phillip: Would you beg me? The way I begged \r\nyou once upon a time. I begged you to give me another chance, to take me back, \r\nnot to destroy our family. Would you beg me? ",
        "Harley: Oh, Phillip. You're sick. ",
        "Phillip: Well, never mind. ",
        "Harley: No, I... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. \r\n(Crying) ",
        "Phillip: You're sorry for what? ",
        "Harley: I'm so sorry for all the hurt I've \r\ncaused you, for all the pressure I put on you. You're right. Everything you said \r\nabout me. I'm obsessive. I'm a perfectionist. I've hurt all the people in my \r\nlife. I just want to make this right. Please forgive me. (Crying) ",
        "Phillip: All right. Okay. Hey. Okay. That's \r\nenough. That's enough. That's enough. Because I do understand. I know what it \r\nfeels like to beg and to crawl for something that you desperately want, and then \r\nnot to get it. ",
        "Harley: Phillip? ",
        "Phillip: See, I wish I could believe you, \r\nHarley. But I can't. ",
        "Harley: What? ",
        "Phillip: I can't believe you. ",

        "Phillip: Honey, listen. I'm your father. You \r\nhave to trust me. ",
        "Lizzie: How can I do that, Daddy? You had me \r\nkidnapped. Fathers, they drive their kids to college, they walk them down the \r\naisle. They don't have some guy take them away from everything they love. \n",
