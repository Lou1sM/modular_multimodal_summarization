        "Cassie: Josh, um... ",
        "Josh: Just a second, because I have a toast\r\nin my head and it's a two-parter, and I don't want to forget it, so I'd like to\r\njust say it, okay? ",
        "Cassie: Okay. ",
        "Josh: Okay, here's the first part. Um... just a second... yeah. Uh, here's to Reva being out of\r\nthe hospital, and may this be her first step toward... down the road of getting\r\nwell. You know, I mean, I know it's going to be a while because the doctor said\r\nit was going to be-- what?-- Five years before she's fully cured, and we're\r\ngoing to have to have that hanging over our heads. We'll have to keep our eyes\r\nout for, um, signs that... okay, okay, um... anyway, she's with us, and that's\r\na blessing, okay? Now... and part two is this, um... yeah. To\r\nus. ",
        "Cassie: What about us? ",
        "Josh: Huh? Oh, um... well, what I said\r\nbefore, that, um... what we have is ours, and Reva has nothing to do with it. ",
        "Cassie: Well said. Cheers! Now, get out. ",
        "",
        "Reva: Hi. It's me. Look, I was wondering,\r\nthe offer you made me at the hospital, does that still stand? Good, because I'd...\r\nI'd like to take you up on it. Great. I'll see you\r\nlater. ",
        "Billy: Well, I didn't figure you could\r\nhandle much more than just plain old toast. ",
        "Reva: Billy... ",
        "Billy: You know what? I thought we'd maybe\r\ndial in a movie tonight. ",
        "Reva: Billy... ",
        "Billy: I could put on some sounds, too. ",
        "Reva: No, I don't want you to do that. You\r\nhave already done enough for me. ",
        "Billy: Oh, come on, darling. Look, you\r\nstared down death and you made him blink. Now, at least let me make your\r\ntransition a little nicer. ",
        "Reva: I don't want that. ",
        "Billy: Sweetie, just eat your toast. ",
        "Reva: I don't want the toast! I don't want\r\nany of this. ",
        "Billy: Oh, and why, pray tell, is that?\r\nCould it be that you are waiting for this guy? ",
        "",
        "Marina: I stayed up half the night with Blake, just hoping\r\nshe'd at least open her eyes. ",
        "Harley: Rick said there's no way of knowing\r\nwhen that might happen. ",
        "Marina: Well, it better happen soon so she can answer some\r\nquestions for me. Hey, I'm sorry. She's your friend, and I'm treating this like\r\na normal case. ",
        "Harley: No, I do it all of the time. Don't\r\nworry. I just can't believe I didn't know that she was the one running that web\r\nsite. How did I miss that? ",
        "Marina: Could you hold on just one second? Hey, Jonathan...\r\n",
        "Jonathan: Hey. ",
        "Marina: I just wanted to tell you, I'm so happy for you. ",
        "Jonathan: Why? ",
        "Marina: Reva. Oh, my God, you don't know. She's getting\r\nreleased from the hospital. ",
        "Jonathan: Are you serious? ",
        "Marina: Yes. ",
        "Jonathan: When? ",
        "Marina: Actually, right about now. ",
        "Jonathan: Reva's released? ",
        "Harley: More like bullied her way out.\r\nThat's what I heard, anyway. ",
        "Jonathan: Oh! Good, oh, come here! Yeah! Oh,\r\nshe's back! That's awesome! Does Tammy know that? ",
        "Marina: You know, I'll call her. ",
        "Jonathan: Okay, good, all right. Thank you,\r\nthank you. I'm going to go to Cedars. All right, girls. (Laughter) ",
        "Marina: Well, at least there's some happy news, right? ",
        "Harley: And we'll have more when we find out\r\nwho dropped that poison in Blake\u2019s drink. ",
        "",
        "Dinah: All right, can you do... do me a\r\nfavor, please, and get the elevator. ",
        "Mallet: Not until you tell me where you're\r\ngoing. ",
        "Dinah: Nowhere special, why? ",
        "Mallet: The timing is kind of interesting,\r\ndon't you think? ",
        "Dinah: I think the timing's perfect. The\r\nnews is that Blake is the Springfield blogger, and by tomorrow morning she will be the most hated woman in\r\ntown, and I don't think I want to deal with that. ",
        "Mallet: Uh-huh. It's\r\nfunny how news spreads in a town like this, isn't it? I mean, it's funny how\r\nsome people find out the news earlier than others. ",
        "Dinah: So? ",
        "Mallet: So, these people that find out the\r\nnews might have time to get a little payback, say, by poisoning a lady and\r\nstill might have some time to pack a bag or two and split! ",
        "Dinah: Are you accusing me of killing Blake?\r\n",
        "Mallet: No. I'm just telling you what I\r\nthink. Do you want me to get the elevator for you? ",
        "",
        "Jeffrey: If you're going to stay, would you\r\nmind... you know, maybe we could do this behind closed doors. ",
        "Olivia:\r\nJeffrey O\u2019Neill? No, it can't be Jeffrey. I know Jeffrey. But I remember his face.\r\nDo you think I wouldn't recognize a guy who has a face just like Richard\u2019s? ",
        "Ditkins:\r\nWho says he looked like Prince Richard that night? ",
        "Jeffrey: I just don't want people to get the\r\nwrong idea. ",
        "Olivia: About... about our mayor? No, no, we\r\ncouldn't have that happen, could we? ",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, look, there's concrete\r\nevidence that Blake Marler was actually running the \"Springfield Burns\"\r\nweb site, okay? As acting mayor and as assistant district attorney, I have\r\nevery right to be here investigating the crime. ",
        "Olivia: Yeah, then maybe if you can make Blake\r\ndisappear off the canvas then you can take \"acting\" out of your\r\ntitle. ",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I guess you know me pretty\r\nwell. ",
        "Olivia: Oh, better than you think. ",
        "Jeffrey: Are you okay? ",
        "Olivia: Yeah. Just, um... just stay where\r\nyou are. You know, there's a party going on downstairs. ",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, I know. It's a little\r\nunseemly to be partying when Blake is in the hospital. ",
        "Olivia: Still, this is your moment in the\r\nsun, isn't it? ",
        "Jeffrey: Well, this isn't how I planned it. ",
        "Olivia: Well, life never is, is it? ",
        "Jeffrey: No. ",
        "Olivia: Still, you're a party kind of guy. I\r\nmean, I'm sure there are just loads of female admirers down there who want to\r\nshow you how they voted. ",
        "Jeffrey: What is this fascination with the\r\nparty? ",
        "Olivia: Just that you're a good-looking guy,\r\nand now a political celebrity to boot. I'm sure that you're going to have to\r\nbeat them off with a stick. ",
        "Jeffrey: Maybe so. ",
        "Olivia: Have you ever been to one of those\r\nfancy events where you actually had to be the pursuer? You know, where you had\r\nto ply some sweet young thing with alcohol before she fell under your spell? ",
        "Jeffrey: You know, I don't\r\nknow... ",
        "Olivia: And used her up and just throw her\r\nout before she even knew what was happening to her, make sure you never had to\r\nsee her again? I'm sure if you did, everything just would turn out fine for\r\nyou. You're the type where it always does. ",
        "Jeffrey: Where is this all coming from? ",
        "Ashlee: Oh, sorry. What are you doing here, Mr.\r\nO\u2019Neill? ",
        "Jeffrey: What are you doing here, Ashlee? ",
        "Ashlee: I worked for Blake\u2019s campaign, and\r\nyou didn't, which means that you snuck in to look at her stuff. Wait until mom\r\nhears about this. ",
        "Olivia: Don't waste the D.A.'s time. He had\r\na warrant to be in here, so I let him in. ",
        "Ashlee: Fine. ",
        "Jeffrey: I guess I owe you one. ",
        "",
        "Dinah: You think I poisoned Blake, but you'd\r\nlet me leave town? ",
        "Mallet: It doesn't matter what I think. Do\r\nyou trust me? ",
        "Dinah: Mallet. ",
        "Mallet: Do you trust me after all this time,\r\nall the stupid screw-ups, all the stupid mistakes? ",
        "Dinah: You came here to do what? ",
        "Mallet: I came here to look you in the eye\r\nand tell you that the security camera caught you going into Blake\u2019s room. The\r\nsecurity camera saw you leave Blake\u2019s room with proof in your hand she is the\r\nblogger. 20 minutes later, she's flat on the ground, nearly dead. ",
        "Dinah: It looks pretty bad, don't it? ",
        "Mallet: It looks pretty bad. I'm not judging\r\nyou, okay? But I'm done pretending like I don't want to protect you. I'm done\r\npretending like I don't want you to trust me. ",
        "Dinah: When Blake put on that web site, it\r\ncost me you. ",
        "Mallet: Yeah. ",
        "Dinah: The most important person in my life.\r\n",
        "Mallet: Do you trust me? ",
        "Dinah: What if I told you I did try to kill Blake?\r\nWhat if I told you that? ",
        "Mallet: Do you trust me? ",
        "Dinah: Yes, but only if you trust me when I\r\ntell you something. ",
        "Mallet: Go ahead. ",
        "Dinah: No. No, I did not try to kill Blake.\r\nNo, I did not try to poison Blake. But I need you to believe me this time. ",

        "Josh: What are you...? Oh. Colin McCabe. ",
        "Cassie: Exactly, yeah. I heard the nurses\r\ntalking about him in the hospital, and he's only in town for a short time. He's\r\ngiving this lecture, and I think you should go see him. ",
        "Josh: Why is that? ",
        "Cassie: Because he knows more about Reva\u2019s\r\ncase than anybody. So go, ask questions, get answers, and come back, and I will\r\nbe here. ",
        "Josh: You don't feel at all, um... ",
        "Cassie: Threatened? ",
        "Josh: Yeah. ",
        "Cassie: By you being involved in Reva\u2019s\r\nrecovery. First of all, whatever information you can get from Dr. McCabe\r\nbenefits us both. And, secondly, you have been working overtime to reassure me\r\nthat what's going on with Reva isn't going to affect us, and now I get to show\r\nyou that I believe you. ",
        "Josh: Okay. ",

        "Reva: Because he's with my sister. ",
        "Billy: And I wonder why that is. ",
        "Reva: Don't lecture me. I know that I pushed\r\nthem together even though they were already halfway there. Josh is with Cassie\r\nnow, and that's a fact whether I'm sick or not. ",
        "Billy: Darling, you wanted them to be\r\nhappy... ",

        "Reva: Yeah? Well, I never promised you that\r\nI would be consistent or make any sense. Hell, I don't even know how I want\r\nthings to be, but I sure as hell know that I don't want them to be like this. ",
        "Billy: Well, there's the good aspect. The\r\nold Reva\u2019s back. ",

        "Reva: You're probably right. ",
        "",
        "Colin: All that information that Dr. Bauer\r\ngave you is very important. There's lots of research to prove that diet and\r\nlifestyle greatly increase the chances for a full recovery. The risk for\r\nreoccurrence is highest in the first few years. Reva's going to need lots of\r\nexams and her doctors are going to need to be very vigilant. ",
        "Josh: What kind of odds are we looking at? ",
        "Colin: It's hard to give you numbers because\r\nit varies so much from case to case. I wish I could tell you that reoccurrence\r\nwas rare, but the good news is Reva is rare. ",
        "Josh: Yes, she is. ",
        "Colin: It was pretty clear it was her\r\nfeelings for you all along that kept her going. And as wrongheaded as I thought\r\nthat it was keeping her condition from you, it came from wanting the best for\r\nyou. I'm glad you finally found out, though. Who knows? In the end, it might\r\nhave been the difference in her being a statistic and a survivor. Okay, I'm\r\ngoing to check in on her, but I need to deal with this first. ",
        "Josh: Dr. McCabe, listen, about Reva being\r\nmy wife... ",
        "Colin: Josh, you don't have to say anything\r\nabout it. I'm glad you two are together, where you belong. ",

        "Jonathan: I am sure that that's true. I\r\nbelieve you. That cancer took a humongous bite out of Reva. But pushing you\r\naway so you could hook up with Cassie took an even bigger one.
