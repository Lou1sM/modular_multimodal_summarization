        "Alan: Any news?",
        "Beth: No. Lizzie, you really should try to eat some breakfast.",
        "Lizzie: I can't eat, Mom.",
        "Beth: I want you to eat something. I want to know at least one of my children is all right.",
        "Alan: Beth. Beth, listen to me. We're going to get them back. Everything is going to be okay.",
        "Beth: All right. You're right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: Oh, Beth, you and I've been through so much together. I know exactly what you're thinking right now. You're wondering how this man that you have loved so much for so long could be so horrible to you, how he could take your child. But how could you, Beth, how could you take her from me? Look at you, Alan. Finally, got a problem you have no idea on how to solve, don't you? I tried to protect you. Tried to protect this family. Tried to make a better future for all of us what did you do? What did you all do? You made me think I was crazy. Sent Rick to drug me back into Ravenwood. And worst of all you poisoned my daughter against me. Lizzie, sweetheart, I don't blame you. I know that none of this is your fault. But I do blame the rest of them. I have to. And they have to be made to understand that there are consequences for what they've done. All of them. Olivia. How could you possibly think that you would ever be fit to raise my child? I give your sham of a marriage to Bill six months tops. And then you'll be off to your next loveless relationship. Did you really believe that I would allow you to take Emma along for the ride? My little girl. You robbed me of her birth in the first few months of her life. She deserves more than you could ever give to her. And I'll make sure she gets it. And who could forgive my brother Gus? The newest addition to the Spaulding family. This week anyway. Who knows what you'll be calling yourself next week. What did you ever want with us, Gus? The only loyalty you could have is to yourself. Ah, Rick. You're like my brother. I know you know what loyalty is. Which makes what you've done all the more unforgivable. Frank, Buzz, Coop, you humiliated my family and you tried to take Lizzie and Zach away from me. And finally, there's you, Harley. You could have stopped all of this. I was willing to live and let live. But you... you push people into corners and then you wonder why they push back. Well, I mean, of course you wonder, because in your own head, you're always right. And you're morally superior to the rest of us. You thought you could fool me by masquerading as Ruth. You'd thought you'd have your revenge, make a fool of me. But I'm the one who will be serving that dish, Harley. And it's a bitter, bitter pill that you're going to have to swallow. I loved you all in one way or another. My family. My everything. Just one thing left to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Okay, 12:00 on the nose. Let's get going. You guys ready?",
        "Buzz: Okay. No, I got to get keys.",
        "Frank: All right. You coming?",
        "Coop: Yeah.",
        "Frank: All right, let's go.",
        "Harley: Where are we going?",
        "Frank: Well, we're going to split up and we're going to take some different leads. And hopefully it'll lead us to Phillip and the kids.",
        "Harley: Where do I start?",
        "Frank: Well, you could start by going upstairs where Delano and Murphy are going to keep an eye on you until we get back.",
        "Harley: Excuse me?",
        "Frank: You are too emotionally involved.",
        "Harley: And Rick's not? Phillip has his son too.",
        "Frank: Sis, you pulled a gun on Phillip yesterday. Let us do the work.",
        "Harley: Frank, you cannot send me up to my room like I'm a child.",
        "Frank: Now, Harley, it's either that or I'm going to take you down to holding cell. It's your choice.",
        "Buzz: For your own protection, kiddo.",
        "Harley: Do I have any say in this at all?",
        "(All): No.",
        "Harley: And you all just know absolutely what's best for me, huh?",
        "(All): Yeah.",
        "Harley: Just get me regular status reports, okay?",
        "Frank: I promise. We'll keep you filled in, okay, sis?",
        "Harley: Okay. Go ahead before I change my mind.",
        "Buzz: Love you.",
        "Frank: All right. Warren, keep an eye on her.",
        "Harley: Just bring my babies back to me.",
        "Frank: Okay, Dad and I are going to head back to the airport.",
        "Rick: All right. I'm going to go to the Beacon and talk to Olivia.",
        "Frank: All right. Thanks, Rick.",
        "Coop: I'm going to head over to the Spaulding's and...",
        "Buzz: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, you're not. When it comes to the Spaulding's, Frank and I deal with the Spaulding's.",
        "Coop: Well, I work for them right now, and besides, Alan is good with me, after I saved Lizzie from Phillip's enforcer guy. Besides, I...",
        "Frank: Besides what?",
        "Coop: I just want to make sure that Lizzie's all right. I mean, that is my job, after all.",
        "Buzz: I got some news for you. Lizzie hasn't been all right for a long time.",
        "Coop: Dad, wait. You don't have to tell me that, believe me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: This is not a good time.",
        "Coop: I'm not here to start a fight, Mr. Spaulding. I just wanted to stop by and see how Lizzie was doing.",
        "Alan: Her family is taking care of that.",
        "Coop: Like you took care of your son?",
        "Alan: Get out.",
        "Lizzie: Granddad, please, okay? He really did help me yesterday. Just ease up on him, please.",
        "Beth: Alan. It's okay.",
        "Alan: All right, Elizabeth, if that's what you want.",
        "Lizzie: You know, we can go in the living room.",
        "Coop: Or the kitchen. I'm guessing you didn't eat anything today, or perhaps get any sleep last night? All right, come on. Well, great. So you're either going to faint from starvation or exhaustion and let me guess, I will get blamed for that, then, too.",
        "Beth: Try to get her to eat something, Coop.",
        "Alan: You know, I hate to admit it, Beth, but there's some truth to what he just said. This crisis is in large part my fault.",
        "Beth: No. It's not.",
        "Alan: Beth, you know more than anyone how I have tortured Phillip down through the years, and when I finally realized what was happening, it was too late.",
        "Beth: Hey, Alan, we were all slow on the uptake. But what's done is done. All that matters now is that we get the children back and like you just said to me in there, we will get them back. I'm going to make some more calls.",
        "Alan: All right. I'll check with security.",
        "Phillip: Beth. I had to see you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Hey, Brian, what is this about us having to move?",
        "Cop: Move?",
        "Harley: You don't know? Nobody radioed you? Oh, great. Joe is on the upstairs phone with Frank, something about a tip, something about this not being a safe place anymore.",
        "Cop: Relax. Let me check with Joe.",
        "Harley: Okay. I don't mean to yell at you.",
        "Cop: Don't worry about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: What have you done with our son?",
        "Phillip: He's safe.",
        "Beth: Where?",
        "Phillip: He's safe, Beth.",
        "Beth: Alan!",
        "Phillip: Beth.",
        "Beth: Alan! Alan!",
        "Phillip: Beth, Beth, Beth. Listen to me. Listen to me. I'm going to give James back to you. Do you hear me? But first you have to hear me out, and to do that, you have to be quiet. So will you do that for me? Will you please just listen to me and let me explain? Thank you.",
        "Beth: You're returning the children?",
        "Phillip: Not all of them. Just James, to you. I'm sure Lizzie has told you by now what happened last night.",
        "Beth: You tried to kidnap her.",
        "Phillip: I wanted her to be with me, but she refused.",
        "Beth: You tried to take her by force!",
        "Phillip: I love her and I wanted her with me, but she is an adult and she has the right to make up her own mind. I was wrong to try to force her to do otherwise, just as I was wrong to take James from you. You are his mother and you're a good mother, unlike Harley and Olivia. You and I share the same values and I know that you will raise him well, so I am returning him to you.",
        "Beth: Phillip, what about Zach? What about Jude and Emma?",
        "Phillip: They will stay with me.",
        "Beth: No, Phillip. Phillip, look at me. You can't do this.",
        "Phillip: I do not trust the others, Beth. I trust you.",
        "Beth: No. Don't. Don't do this. Please don't do this.",
        "Phillip: Listen to me.",
        "Beth: No.",
        "Phillip: What you and I had was the first and the best, for both of us. And no matter what I ever do, you are my family and I will always love you.",
        "Beth: I love you, Phillip. Please don't do this. Please. Please, okay, think. I want you to think of Rick.",
        "Phillip: Be at company at 9:00. Don't tell anyone or James will be gone when you get there and you will not see him again.",
        "Beth: (Sobbing)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: What? What do you mean I can't tell anybody. I have to tell Harley and Beth.",
        "Phillip: Well, if you do, the deal is off and you will not see Jude again. He's your son. He needs you. But if you want him back, you'll accept these terms. It's the way it has to be and you will not convince me otherwise. Look, I'm going away and I won't be back. And what happened last night, you came after me with the hypodermic, I don't want that to be the last thing that I remember of you, or vice versa. And I know you think that you were doing what you had to do and I do not want to punish you for that. You're my friend. You're my best friend.",
        "Rick: Well, that's just great, Phillip, but this is nonsense. You know this is wrong, Phillip. You know this is wrong. In your heart, you know that.",
        "Phillip: Rick...",
        "Rick: These parents love their children just as much as you do, and you know that.",
        "Phillip: I'm trying to do the right thing by you. Do you accept my offer or not?",
        "Rick: Why don't you look at me, buddy? I'll tell you what, since I want to see my son, I guess I have to take your offer, don't I?",
        "Phillip: How many years did you want to be a father? You lost Abby because of it. And then God finally smiled on you and gave you Jude. Don't make me take him away from you. Be at company at 9:00. Don't tell anyone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Well, that's great. Five hours on the road and nothing but dead ends.",
        "Buzz: Well, you've been racking them up. Oh, I've got to sit for a second. (Sighs)",
        "Frank: You okay, Pop? It's not your heart, is it? You've been taking your medication?",
        "Buzz: Oh, yes, and avoiding stress, too, Frank. Frank, have you ever had a day when everything was bass- ackwards, you know?",
        "Frank: Yeah, only a couple times a day.",
        "Buzz: Oh, man. I thought this was over. I thought this war was ended, I thought nobody else was going to get hurt. You know what the problem is with us, the Coopers, our family? And I've thought about this. We're reactive instead of proactive. You get the difference?",
        "Frank: What are you saying? So, like, instead of being in charge...",
        "Buzz: We get pushed around. We let ourselves get pushed around. It takes a lot of energy to get back up.",
        "Frank: Phillip is so twisted. How could we possibly have known what he was going to do?",
        "Buzz: I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. I don't even think I care anymore, for God's sakes. What we have to think about now is the future, and I think--and I can burn for eternity for this, I know it's heresy--but I think the Coopers should be more Spaulding-like, you know? Know what we want, go after it, play hardball. That's the way, especially with our livelihoods and our children.",
        "Frank: Sounds good to me.",
        "Buzz: I mean, we should think outside the box. Guerrilla warfare. For instance, Phillip took Jude and Zach, so what should we do? We'll take Lizzie, hold her hostage and threaten to kill her. What?",
        "Frank: You're kidding, right?",
        "Buzz: I Don't even know. (Cell phone rings)",
        "Frank: Hold on a second. Sorry. Yeah, Cooper here. What? When? Thanks. God damn it. Harley, she gave Delano and Murphy the slip. She could be anywhere right now. Let's go.",
        "Buzz: Let me get the alarm. I'll be right behind you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: I know. I know you don't work for Spaulding anymore as a pilot. I just thought that when you did, maybe Phillip said something about where he would fly to if he had to leave the country right away. Well, if you think of anything, will you please... thank you. It's a dead end.",
        "Bill: Hey. Don't get discouraged, all right? We will keep brainstorming and eventually we're going to hit on something.",
        "Olivia: While Emma gets farther and farther away from me.",
        "Billy: Hey. How can I help?",
        "Bill: Dad, I think you've already done enough. Really.",
        "Billy: You two, please. I spoke to my friend at INS, I told him that I made a mistake with Olivia's deportation and they should stop the investigation.",
        "Bill: Dad, it's too late. The damage is already done. And besides, why are we going to believe that suddenly you're on our side?",
        "Billy: Because your side is the side of a mother whose baby has been taken from her, and that cuts through all the differences. Phillip took that baby and Phillip's the enemy here, not me.",
        "Bill: Who says I can't have more than one?",
        "Olivia: Stop it. Stop it. My daughter is gone. To hell with everything else.",
        "Bill: Olivia...",
        "Olivia: Leave me alone. I just want to be alone!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: Do you want your daughter back?",
        "Olivia: Oh, you bastard.",
        "Phillip: What is it with you in the elevators? A little more self-control, please.",
        "Olivia: Where is she? Where is she? Answer me. Answer me!",
        "Phillip: All right, stop. I guess you weren't listening. I told you, you can have her back, to raise on your own, and I will be gone.",
        "Olivia: You're going to give her back to me? Just like that.",
        "Phillip: No. There are conditions. I can't get her back until tonight. And in the meantime, you can't tell anybody that I'm here or else the deal is off and you will never see her again. And when I say \"anyone,\" I mean Rick and Harley and Beth. See, I'm not giving the other kids back, just Emma.",
        "Olivia: Just Emma?",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm.",
        "Olivia: Why?",
        "Phillip: Because Emma is a baby and she needs a mother. Even you. And because I know you, Olivia. You fight dirty and you don't give up. So if I take Emma from you, I'll be looking over my shoulder for the rest of my life.",
        "Olivia: You think Harley, Rick and Beth are going to give up more easily? You think they love their children any less? What planet do you live on?",
        "Phillip: No, I know how much they love their kids. But they've known me a lot longer than you have, and Beth and Harley and I have parented children together. Deep down they know I'm a good father, and sooner or later they will remember that and they'll stop being so angry with me.",
        "Olivia: You have truly lost it.",
        "Phillip: I don't have time to debate this with you. If you want Emma back, be at company tonight at 9:00 pm. And if you tell anyone, the deal is off.",
        "Olivia: Oh, I don't believe a word you're saying to me. What are you up to? What are you up to?",
        "Phillip: Company, 9:00 pm. Tell no one.",
        "Olivia: Wait. No, wait! Wait! 9:00 pm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Hey, sorry. I'm glad you came back. What's wrong?",
        "Olivia: Listen, I just... I...",
        "Bill: What?",
        "Olivia: I'm sorry that I ran out on you like that. I just couldn't handle your father.",
        "Bill: Babe, join the club, all right? Come on, let's get a drink. We'll sit down, we'll find out a way to contact Phillip.",
        "Beth: Yeah, scotch on the rocks, please. Almost 6:15.",
        "Bill: Beth? Did you hear anything?",
        "Beth: You?",
        "Bill: No, and we're running out of people to call and places to go.",
        "Beth: Yeah. Well, Lizzie went out with Coop and I was just checking on her.",
        "Bill: All right. Well, let us know if you hear anything, all right?",
        "Beth: You, too.",
        "Bill: Yeah. We will. Right?",
        "Olivia: Yes. Yeah.",
        "Beth: Excuse me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: All right. I got you a sandwich. I hope roast beef is okay with you.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. Here you go, baby.",
        "Coop: Whoa, whoa. Hold up a second. This is not doggy food, this is people food. You can't have any.",
        "Lizzie: Here you go, sweetie. Do you actually think Roxy eats dog food?",
        "Coop: No. I'm sorry, that was silly of me to think.",
        "Lizzie: Nope. Only the best for my little baby. Daddy says that Spaulding's, they...",
        "Coop: You okay?",
        "Lizzie: No, but do you really care?",
        "Coop: No, not really. Eat your sandwich.",
        "Lizzie: Thank you. (Coughs)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Beth, where have you been? I have been worried sick about you.",
        "Beth: Yeah. I went for a walk. I had to get some air. I was making calls from my cell.",
        "Alan: Any luck?",
        "Beth: You?",
        "Alan: No, and I was certain that someone would have been contacted by now, but... wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Did something happen?",
        "Beth: You mean besides the fact that Phillip has kidnapped my son? Besides that?",
        "Alan: No, I know that. You just... you don't seem to be yourself, that's all.",
        "Beth: Well, it's stress, Alan. Have you had any luck tracking down the corporate jet?",
        "Alan: Well, apparently Phillip kidnapped our jet as well as our children. What I don't understand is, he must have paid off a lot of people, because I can get no information. I don't see how we're going to be able to find him, Beth, unless he wants to be found.",
        "Beth: Well, maybe something like that will happen.",
        "Alan: I don't mean to sound negative. I'm just very frustrated with the situation. But don't worry about a thing because we're going to find him, we're going to find those beautiful children and have them home safely where they belong.",
        "Beth: Alan. Alan, I...",
        "Alan: What?",
        "Beth: I just want to thank you. I want to just thank you for everything that you've done.",
        "Alan: Beth, you don't have to thank me. My family is in crisis right now and you know that I love my family more than anything. I love you. I love Elizabeth. My son is going through something right now that I don't understand...",
        "Beth: I have to go. I have to... I have to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Harley, it's me again. I'm making my rounds. I'm... I don't have any leads yet. Why don't you call me when... (telephone rings) hello?",
        "Alan: Gus, I need your help before this thing spins out of control.",
        "Gus: Well, I have a news flash for you, Alan, it's already out of control.",
        "Alan: I know you're angry with me, but this is not a time for family grudges. This is a time that a family pools all of its resources together.",
        "Gus: Look, I've got to go, okay? I've got an angle that I'm working.",
        "Alan: Tell me what angles and maybe I'll be able to help you.",
        "Gus: I've got to go.",
        "Alan: Gus, don't go. Don't hang up on me!",
        "Gus: Hello, Phillip.",
        "Phillip: Hello, Gus.",
        "Gus: How are you? A lot of people worried about you. You all right?",
        "Phillip: I have something to say. Do you want to hear it or not?",
        "Gus: Sure I do.",
        "Phillip: Keep your hands where I can see them, away from that revolver that I know you keep tracked in the back of your belt.",
        "Gus: So, what's on your mind?",
        "Phillip: I have a message that I want you to deliver to Harley. Tell her that I have decided to give her Zach and Jude back.",
        "Gus: Okay.",
        "Phillip: They miss her more than I thought they would. But she has to follow my instructions to the letter.",
        "Gus: Right. Okay.",
        "Phillip: She can have the boys back if she agrees to meet me at company at 9:00 pm tonight and if neither one of you tell a soul about this. And when I say no one, I mean no one. Not Alan, not Rick, not Olivia, not Beth. No one.",
        "Gus: And if somebody does tell somebody something, what happens then?",
        "Phillip: Well, then Harley and Rick will never see the boys again and that will be on your head.",
        "Gus: And the kids, they are... they're in Springfield?",
        "Phillip: Did I say you get to ask questions?",
        "Gus: Well, I just figured they're in Springfield because you said you're going to have them at company by 9:00, so I figured...",
        "Phillip: Let me tell you how I see this, Gus. You can either turn off that little cop switch in your head, simply do what I've told you to do and make a nice thing happen for Harley and Rick. Or you can try to play hero and screw everything up. It's your choice.",
        "Gus: So you're not going to tell me about the kids.",
        "Phillip: Hero? Harley?",
        "Gus: Yeah, company, 9:00. All right, 9:00. It's almost 7:00 now. (Sighs) come on, Harley. Pick up the phone. Pick it up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Man: Harley? Doug Grady. I work these docks? You helped with my son's legal problems back in June.",
        "Harley: Yes, I remember.",
        "Man: I'm real glad I ran into you, ma'am. Malcolm is in trouble again and I need some advice.",
        "Harley: Ssh. Just call one of my partners at my office, okay?",
        "Man: Yeah, but he's...",
        "Harley: I have to go. Phillip will run if he sees me, but he doesn't know I'm Ruth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: I can't believe on top of looking for Phillip now we have to start looking for Harley.",
        "Buzz: Well, she sure isn't here. Where else would she go?",
        "Frank: Well, hopefully she wasn't foolish enough to go to the Spaulding's, but if she was, Coop would have called us, right?",
        "Gus: Guys, I'm glad I ran into you. Did anybody talk to Harley? I left, like, a thousand messages.",
        "Buzz: She took off.",
        "Gus: What does that mean, took off?",
        "Frank: I assigned a couple of uniforms for her to keep an eye on her at company, but she gave them the slip.",
        "Buzz: And God knows where she is.",
        "Frank: She's probably pounding the pavement like the rest of us. Did something happen, Gus? Do you know something that you're not telling us?",
        "Gus: About Harley?",
        "Frank: About Phillip.",
        "Gus: No. No, why would I?",
        "Frank: Because you came in here asking for Harley. I thought you maybe had heard something.",
        "Gus: No. I wish I did. No.",
        "Frank: You sure about that?",
        "Gus: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Frank: Well, I mean, if you'd heard from Phillip, you would have told us, right?",
        "Buzz: Or would you cover for Phillip like you did for Alexandra?",
        "Gus: For God's sakes, this is about four missing children. Do you think that I would honestly do that?",
        "Frank: All right, look, just take it easy. We had to ask.",
        "Gus: If you hear from Harley, could you tell her to call me, please? And it has to be before 9:00.",
        "Buzz: Why before 9:00?",
        "Gus: Just before 9:00. (Cell phone ringing) hey.",
        "Rick: Hey.",
        "Gus: Have you seen Harley?",
        "Rick: No, I haven't seen anybody.",
        "Gus: Okay, well, if you see her, can you just...",
        "Rick: Actually, you know what, Gus? I've got to get going. I'm supposed to meet somebody.",
        "Gus: Okay, but if you see her, can you just make sure that she calls, please?",
        "Rick: You haven't heard anything?",
        "Gus: No. And you're sure you haven't?",
        "Rick: No. (Elevator bell rings)",

        "Alan: Well, I would appreciate any information you could get me about this. And you know that I will make it worth your while. Good.",
        "Phillip: Hello, father.",
        "Alan: Phillip. Where are you?",
        "Phillip: Where I am doesn't matter. It's where you should be. Company, tonight, 9:00 P.M. Sharp.",
        "Alan: Why? What are you up to now?",
        "Phillip: Just be there, or you'll miss all the fun.",
        "Alan: Phillip, listen to me. What you've done so far can be undone if you give yourself up and bring those children here. If you don't, if you take this any further, I will not be able to help you. Do you hear me?",
        "Phillip: Oh, I don't need your help, Dad. You know, it's funny. My whole life, I really thought that I needed you and your approval. I resisted it but I really wanted it. And now I've suddenly realized that I'm actually stronger than you are, and maybe even smarter.",
        "Alan: Well, son, if you are smarter and stronger than I am, then you will do what is right and bring those children home.",
        "Phillip: Sorry. It's too late for that. My plan is already in motion.",
        "Alan: What plan?",
        "Phillip: Dad. Don't you remember? You're the one who drilled it into me. \"Always have a plan, Phillip. Strategy is everything.\" I need to make a point. You really think I would spoil the surprise now?",
        "Alan: Phillip, listen to me, son. You are very sick. You need help, now.",
        "Phillip: Sick? No, Dad. For once, I'm perfectly well. For once, I see things clearly, the way things truly are. I am finally, finally in control.",
        "Alan: I know you think you're in control, but what you've done is not only wrong, Phillip, it is a crime. And if you don't stop now, this thing could end badly, for all of us.",
        "Phillip: Well, it is going to end, Dad. Tonight. Just not the way you think it will.",
        "Alan: Phillip, I want you to come here. I want you to come and talk to me. Let's sit down man-to-man and talk.",
        "Phillip: There's no time.",
        "Alan: I need to see you, son. You owe me this favor as your father.",
        "Phillip: You'll see me. Tonight at company. 9:00. Come alone and tell no one. And I mean, no one.",
        "Alan: Or what will happen? Phillip? Phillip? Phillip, talk to me. Talk to me, Phillip! Where are you? Talk to me!",

        "Cassie: Edmund, my daughter is missing and I can tell you your jealousy is not helping.",
        "Sebastian: Oh, no. Oh, no. Holly, oh, I told you to eat. Holly, are you...",
        "Olivia: You're so concerned about the great Spaulding prince but where are our children? Do you remember them?",
        "Alan: Those children are fine.",
