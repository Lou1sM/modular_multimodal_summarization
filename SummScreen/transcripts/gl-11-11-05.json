        "Ava: Here. It's soup.",
        "Jonathan: I don't want soup. I want to know where the hell Cassie is and whether or not she's okay!",

        "Jonathan: No. Why would I get word?",

        "Jonathan: I don't think so.",
        "Ava: So much for your big plans. You know, you would have thought that Sandy and Tammy would have realized that they belong with us by now. They're getting married.",
        "Jonathan: There's still time.",
        "Ava: I gave Sandy the divorce. And I'm still no closer to being with him than I was weeks ago and you're still no closer to being with Tammy.",

        "Cassie: As if there was ever any doubt. There's my guy!",
        "R.J.: Mommy, we missed you.",
        "Cassie: I missed you, too. All I could think about was these hugs.",

        "Tammy: My hero. Oh, I was so worried.",
        "Cassie: Don't worry, baby. All the rotten things we've been through in the past, they're over. All we have ahead of us now are great things to look forward to. Together.",

        "Harley: Excuse us. I need to talk to him for a second. You're still here?",

        "Harley: Did you?",
        "Mallet: I think so.",
        "Harley: Then I think you should leave. I mean, I'm... I'm not trying to give you the heave-ho, you can do whatever you want. I'm just saying I happen to be suffering from serious book paranoia. Book and videotape.",
        "Mallet: Harley, do you have a problem...",
        "Harley: I know what you're going say the buzz about Blake's novel has died down, but while there is still a hum and until there is dead silence, I do not want the people that I know or work with to think that there's any truth to the rumors about you and me.",
        "Mallet: Right. Okay. I mean, personally I can't wait until the thing is off the best- seller's list.",
        "Harley: Yes. Off the list, off the shelves. Off. Just off.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, yeah. Because you know what? I think it's crazy. It's crazy. All these rumors about you and I still being in love.",
        "Harley: It's insane.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, it's insane.",
        "Dinah: Okay. The sexual tension between the two of you is so thick I could probably cut it with a knife. So I think it's time to get it out in the open.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: Hello, Dad.",
        "Alan: Alan-Michael, welcome home. What a treat to see you, son.",
        "Gus: Hello, Dad.",

        "Alan-Michael: Likewise.",
        "Gus: So what brings you to Springfield?",
        "Alan: Alan-Michael is here in the wake of an unfortunate divorce. He and Lucy Cooper are splitting up.",
        "Alan-Michael: It happens.",
        "Alan: Yes, especially between Coopers and Spaulding's, oil and water.",
        "Gus: So your marriage ended and you rode into town, what, to spring your old man from the nut house? Because if... if that's what's happening here, we got ourselves a problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Hi.",
        "Danny: Hey. You got here fast.",
        "Michelle: Well, you said it was important.",
        "Danny: Yeah, I did.",
        "Michelle: Um, if it's a bad time for you and Marina, I can come back.",
        "Danny: No, no, no, come in. Come in. That's what I wanted to talk to you about. Marina's gone. We're over.",

        "Josh: Hi there. I'm picking up a to-go order for Josh Lewis.",
        "Waitress: Sure, give me one second, I'll be right back.",
        "_Edmund: You never wondered how Jeffrey O 'Neill-- a man virtually identical in every external respect to my poor dead brother Richard-- ended up in Springfield, in Cassie's hotel? _",
        "Reva: Joshua. Thank God. Oh, you brought Cassie home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Mom, what was Edmund thinking? I mean, what was he going to...",
        "Cassie: You know what? None of that matters now. It's over.",

        "Cassie: I did feel tired until I walked through that door and now I feel like celebrating.",
        "Tammy: Yeah?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Sometimes it's the bad things in life that make you want to appreciate all the things you really have, so let's have a party.",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie...",
        "Cassie: Come on, lighten up. It's time to move on and let go of the bad things.",
        "Jeffrey: You can do that after you get rest, okay?",
        "Cassie: Quit worrying and get ready to have some fun because we are going to have fun!",

        "Cassie: Jonathan, are you",
        "Cassie: Jonathan, are you there?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. I wasn't expecting to hear from you. Reva just told me, like, two seconds ago that you were okay.",
        "Cassie: I'm a lucky woman.",
        "Jonathan: What's the deal with Uncle Eddie? Is he out of commission?",
        "Cassie: Definitely.",
        "Jonathan: Then the world's a better place.",
        "Cassie: Which is why I'm calling. I'm throwing a family party right now. Not just to celebrate my coming home but Tammy's wedding and whatever other good things are going on. So I'd like you to come.",
        "Jonathan: You want me at your party?",
        "Cassie: I know you've been trying to change, Jonathan, and keeping you out would only make things worse. So if you feel like stopping by later, Reva will be here.",
        "Jonathan: I don't know, maybe. Um, Cassie, is Tammy... um, never mind. Okay. Well, I'm happy that you're home. Bye. ( Sighs )",
        "Ava: You're going, aren't you",
        "Jonathan: Why? So I can watch Tammy play kissy-face with your ex-husband? No. No. That's not a celebration, that's torture.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I know you're not Richard, but you're reminding me of him more and more.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, it might have something to do with the face.",
        "Tammy: No. I mean, there's the hero thing. But mostly, I it's the way you make mom happy the way he used to. More and more.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. How about you, Tammy? Are you happy?",
        "Tammy: Of course! Why wouldn't I be?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: I'm just glad Cassie's home safe.",
        "Reva: Yeah. I mean and the fact that you went down there without a moment's hesitation to bring her back safe. It's just... I mean, with everything that's going on between you and I, it just...",
        "Josh: Reva, as far as I'm concerned Cassie is family. Whatever's happening between us doesn't change that and I don't want it to. Oh, thank you. That's for me, right? That's grilled cheese, ham and tomato?",
        "Reva: No, actually, I think that's my order.",
        "Josh: Did we order the same thing?",
        "Reva: Were you going to bring this to Cassie?",
        "Josh: That's your bag and that's mine. Well, it's her favorite thing, right? Grilled cheese and tomato?",
        "Reva: Why do you think I ordered it? I'll flip you for who gets to walk into the farmhouse with you first.",
        "Josh: How about we do it together?",
        "Reva: Okay, that's a deal.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Reva: So how bad did it get down there?",
        "Josh: In San Cristobel? Well, it could have been a lot worse. Edmund had plans for Cassie, but they don't matter anymore because Jeffrey... hey, when did you first meet Jeffrey?",
        "Reva: Uh, I don't know. It was right around the time of the fund-raiser at the Beacon for Richard's Memorial Library. Why?",
        "Josh: Just curious, that's all. Are you ready to go?",
        "Reva: Yeah. That'd be nice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: Give me a second, Gus. Dad and I have some things to catch up on. Where do I start? The part where you murdered your own son or maybe when you framed Harley for it? I can't really decide. But I couldn't resist dropping by to see that you finally wound up with what you've always deserved: Nothing. Now what was your problem?",
        "Gus: I don't have a problem.",
        "Alan: The fact that you came home is proof that this family has a strong pull in your life, Alan Michael.",
        "Alan-Michael: Forget it, Dad. I just wanted to see you in your rubber room. Makes me feel a whole lot better about the world. Now I can leave happy.",
        "Alan: Leave? You just got here. Why are you leaving?",
        "Alan-Michael: Why? Harley's got business under control at Spaulding, you're happily out of the loop and I can leave happy now.",
        "Alan: So you've got things to do. Let me ask you this: What is more important than your family and your father, huh?",
        "Alan-Michael: ( Sighs ) You want to answer this?",
        "Gus: You're on a roll, go for it.",
        "Alan: So you two have just met and you're ganging up on me, is that it?",
        "Alan-Michael: I can already tell we've got in a lot in common.",
        "Gus: Like a father who kills. My pleasure seeing him locked up indefinitely.",
        "Gus: Little Al. I'm going to call you. I'm very happy you came to town, that's all I can say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: I want the two of you to listen to me, okay? I think it's time we get things out in the open and see where things stand.",
        "Harley: With where things stand with what?",
        "Dinah: Do you want Harley?",
        "Harley and Mallet: What?",
        "Dinah: Do you want Harley?",
        "Mallet: Uh... no.",
        "Harley: ( Scoffs )",
        "Dinah: Do you want he?",
        "Mallet: Uh... God no.",
        "Dinah: Okay, then.",
        "Harley: Do you believe him?",
        "Dinah: You know what? I'm not so sure, but I am very clear about something. Neither one of us want you.",
        "Harley: I definitely do not.",
        "Dinah: Well, good. Then the bottom line is there is nothing going on between the two of us and Detective Mallet. So it's simple. We can all move on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: You broke up with Marina?",
        "Danny: No, she left me. Marina wants all of me, everything I've got and she doesn't think I can give it to her.",
        "Michelle: Why?",
        "Danny: Because she thinks I can never stop being in love with you.",
        "Michelle: Is she right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: You both know I never meant to hurt either one of you.",
        "Alan-Michael: Is that what you said to Phillip before you put a couple holes in him?",
        "Alan: If you will sit down and give me a chance to explain what has been....",
        "Alan-Michael: One more chance you mean. After all the other chances I've given you, sorry, I'm fresh out.",
        "Gus: I know that feeling.",
        "Alan-Michael: You can earn some respect, though. Leave Harley alone; let her do her job.",
        "Gus: That sounds like a good offer. I'd take that one, jump all over it.",
        "Alan: Gus, why don't you ask your brother how his marriage to Harley Cooper ended. Make you can take a few notes for future reference.",
        "Alan-Michael: We were young, we made a mistake, end of story. He's a charmer, isn't he?",
        "Gus: I can't get enough of him.",
        "Alan: Harley Cooper is the worst thing that ever happened to this family and to this family's business.",
        "Alan-Michael: What do you say we get out of here?",
        "Gus: Sounds good to me. You can tell me what happened to you and Harley.",
        "Alan-Michael: Young, mistake, end of story.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: It took me a long time to get over you. I put my entire life on hold. I waited until... until I thought I knew for sure that it was over, that we would never be what we were.",
        "Michelle: Well, we can be.",
        "Danny: I gave up on it, Michelle. I gave up on it. And it was... I mean, it was one of the hardest things that I ever had to do, but I did it. I moved on because I had to. And not just for me, but for Robbie. I moved on and I... I found someone else. I learned how to live without you.",
        "Michelle: Well, you don't have to anymore, Danny. Look, Marina left because of me, because she believed that you didn't ever really stop loving me.",
        "Danny: She was wrong, Michelle. I did stop. I had to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: How come when you put a couple women together it always starts to feel like high school, huh? How are you guys going to start sending notes back and forth about me during meetings?",
        "Dinah: Oh, maybe. We might.",
        "Mallet: You know what? I really apologize for suggesting you hire Dinah. Huge mistake.",
        "Harley: Not where from where I stand. Actually, I think... I think Dinah being here is the best thing that's happened to me since I came to Spaulding.",
        "Dinah: Thank you. Nice of you to say that. Thank you.",
        "Harley: You have been a tremendous help to me, Dinah. And now I'm going to return the favor.",
        "Dinah: How?",
        "Harley: Well, since you and Mallet will probably be spending a lot of time together working on Ross' campaign, I'm going to give you a few lessons in working with Mallet.",
        "Mallet: Oh, boy, here we go.",
        "Harley: Get out of my chair. First of all, you can trust this guy.",
        "Mallet: Thank you.",
        "Harley: He's loyal. Like a mule. No, more like an ox.",
        "Dinah: Ox, yes. I see ox.",
        "Mallet: Well, here's where I head back to the barn. Hey, Alan Michael Spaulding!",
        "Gus: You two know each other?",
        "Alan-Michael: Oh, yeah, we're old pals.",
        "Dinah: Well, I guess you can't go anywhere in this town without running into one of Harley's ex's, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: For you.",
        "Jeffrey: Drinks are served. Who needs a drink?",
        "Reva: I would love some.",
        "Tammy: Uncle Josh, I don't know how I can ever thank you.",
        "Josh: Just get married and be happy.",
        "Reva: You know, that oddly sounds like a toast so I guess I'll go ahead and make it an official one. Welcome home, sis, I'd like to be the first one to welcome you home because the thought was so unbelievably scary that you might... well. And also to you three heroes. You are my heroes because you were the ones who brought her home.",
        "Jeffrey: I'll drink to that. ( Laughter )",
        "Reva: I'm not finished yet! First of all, I want to say you're a good team and second of all I'd like to toast to Sandy and Tammy. May you always be safe and happy together wherever the stars may lead you.",
        "Jeffrey: Hear, hear!",
        "Sandy: Thank you, Reva.",
        "( Knock on door )",
        "Tammy: Who else are we expecting? Harley, Uncle Billy?",
        "Tammy: Hi.",
        "Jonathan: Hi.",
        "Tammy: What are you doing here?",
        "Cassie: I invited him. Come on in.",
        "Jonathan: Uh, no thanks. I just stopped by to give you a quick welcome back. I have to go back to the club.",
        "Cassie: Jonathan, you are a part of this family and were hurt by Edmund every bit as much as I was.",
        "Tammy: Mom, if he doesn't want to stay...",
        "Cassie: I said I wanted us all to move forward and I meant all. Come on in, have a drink, grab something to eat. It is a party.",
        "Tammy: Enjoy.",
        "Reva: Why are you here?",
        "Jonathan: You heard Cassie, she invited me.",
        "Reva: You didn't have to say yes.",
        "Jonathan: I didn't.",
        "Reva: Why do you do this to yourself let alone to Tammy?",
        "Jonathan: Best explanation? I can't help myself.",
        "Sandy: Wow! Check these out.",
        "Tammy: They're beautiful.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I thought so.",
        "Sandy: We can use these for the rest of our lives. Thanks, Josh.",
        "Josh: Yeah, sure. Hey, there. You recovered yet from our rescue mission?",
        "Jeffrey: Back to normal, whatever that is.",
        "Josh: Well you must be used to this kind of stuff from your old line of work.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, yeah. I used to like that kind of stuff, but now I'm on operation domesticity.",
        "Josh: Ah, I see. But back in the old days, did that work ever take you to San Cristobel before?",
        "Jeffrey: Not really, why?",
        "Cassie: Can't have grilled cheese, ham and tomato without wine, can you?",
        "Sandy: I can already see us passing these down to our kids.",
        "Tammy: Hey, you know what? I'm going to put these away before I break them because you know what a klutz I am. Anything I touch, gets smashed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Hello, sweetheart.",
        "Alan: Sweetheart? What do I owe this outpouring of affection, Beth?",
        "Beth: I hear that Alan- Michael is back in town. I need to know where I stand, Alan.",
        "Alan: You need to know where you stand? I'll tell you, Beth. You stand at the very heart of what Spaulding Enterprises is all about, and that will not change! Yes, Alan Michael is back in town, but he is no friend of ours. As a matter of fact, he's as bitter as Gus. He's already joined sides with him. He also thinks that Harley is a wonderful CEO and should remain there until her retirement. So it looks like it's us against them.",
        "Beth: Look at me. I will never abandon you, Alan. Never.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Hi, sweetie. I see you guys have all been introduced.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Alan-Michael: Are you working here, A.C.?",
        "Dinah: No, with me. For me, with my dad.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, Ross is running for Congress. I'm heading up his security detail.",
        "Alan-Michael: I thought he was working with you.",
        "Harley: They are. They are on the police force together.",
        "Alan-Michael: Let me get this straight. You two have been working together, but now you're going to work together and you already work together? You know what? I've got to go.",
        "Gus: I'll walk you out.",
        "Harley: See ya.",
        "Gus: Can I ask you something? You and Harley, you're on good terms, right?",
        "Alan-Michael: Definitely. I get it, one less problem, huh?",
        "Gus: What?",
        "Alan-Michael: Mallet?",
        "Gus: Oh, no, no. He's not a problem. Would it be better if he was married with his kids living in Siberia? Absolutely, but no.",
        "Alan-Michael: I hope it won't be any trouble if I end up sticking around.",
        "Gus: No, no. Not at all. You and Harley are friends, right? I just... you know, I just happen to know that there's one major difference between you and Mallet. See, Mallet, he's still in love with Harley.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Michelle, I moved on because you... you were gone.",
        "Michelle: I know.",
        "Danny: And Marina, she wanted to be with me and I wanted to be with her. And we fell in love.",
        "Michelle: And you were happy.",
        "Danny: Yeah, Michelle. We were happy. You know, my life with Marina was simple. It was easy. And she didn't deserve to be hurt like this.",
        "Michelle: And that's what happened.",
        "Danny: Yeah, Michelle, because the rest of my life wasn't simple. You and I, we're not simple. We never were simple. ( Sighs )",
        "Michelle: But we always had love, Danny. We always had love.",
        "Danny: Yeah, Michelle. And hurt. And pain. And fear that what we have is not going to last. And that's exactly what happened to us time and time again. It's like a... it's like a shadow just hanging over us. When I look at you and there's so much love between us, but there is also so much hurt.",
        "Michelle: I wouldn't trade it for the world.",
        "Michelle: Danny, I love you. You said yourself that what we have is unbreakable. Let me prove to you how right you are. We are the loves of each other's lives. You don't throw that a way, no matter how tough things get. And it's not just us anymore. We have a son and we have a daughter.",
        "Danny: I know. I know.",
        "Michelle: And look at your little girl. This is our little girl. Are you going to walk away from the life that she deserves to have? Are you going to make the mistake that I made when I left town? Don't. I want our family back.",
        "Danny: Michelle, you gave up on me. I don't want to go through that again.",
        "Michelle: Things can be different this time.",
        "Danny: Why? Why? Because we love each other? ( Sighs ) I don't want to love you anymore Michelle. I don't. I'm sorry.",

        "Mallet: You were lying before.",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Mallet: When you said you weren't interested in me. You so are.",
        "Dinah: Detective, dream on.",

        "Harley: Sorry about all this.",
        "Gus: What's \"this?\" \"This\" what?",
        "Harley: My ex-husbands. The drama, the hassle, my baggage.",
        "Gus: Really? Seems to go with the territory when it comes to you, honey. It's all right. I just think that Frank could have picked somebody else to be head of Ross' security team except he picks Mallet and now he's got to be around you.",
        "Harley: Hey, look on the bright side. Maybe it's more because of Dinah than me.",
        "Gus: Dinah?",
        "Harley: Yeah, she thinks he's got a thing for her. Has he said anything to you about that?",
        "Gus: Well, we haven't exactly had a heart-to-heart in a while. Ever.",
        "Harley: Yeah. Personally I don't see it. The thing. Thing.",
        "Gus: Thing. Honey, you never know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: It's slow. I meant the elevator.",
        "Mallet: Yeah. Yeah, it's a real mechanical wonder.",
        "Alan-Michael: Listen if you two want to fight, go to it. Don't mind me.",
        "Dinah: You know, when you're working with my father, I really would appreciate it if you don't look at me or talk to me, you got it?",
        "Mallet: I don't think I take orders from you.",
        "Dinah: Okay, well then I'll tell my father to tell you.",
        "Mallet: Why would I want to talk to you anyway?",
        "Dinah: Because I don't think you can shut up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: Beth, Hi, great to see you.",
        "Beth: Hi!",
        "Alan-Michael: You look fantastic.",
        "Beth: Well, thank you. Good to see you, I heard that you were in town. For how long?",
        "Alan-Michael: Have dinner with me and I'll tell you about it. How about it? A little alone time.",
        "Beth: Are you flirting with me?",
        "Alan-Michael: Not very well if you have to ask.",
        "Beth: You do know that I'm married to your father, right?",
        "Alan: So?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Hey, smile. Your mom's home; these didn't hit the floor. It's a good day. You should be happy.",
        "Tammy: I am.",
        "Jonathan: Am I ruining the party for you?",
        "Tammy: No. Thank you for...",
        "Reva: You can ask him to go.",
        "Tammy: It's okay.",
        "Reva: No, it's not okay. I see how upset you've been since he got here.",
        "Tammy: Well, it's a family party and he's family.",
        "Reva: I don't mean that, honey. He's my son and I love him, but he shouldn't be here. Invitation or, no he shouldn't keep coming after you the way he does.",
        "Tammy: He's not after me.",
        "Reva: I don't mean to hurt you. I don't think he'd ever do anything to cause you pain again. It's... it's not like before, though, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: I don't want to talk about this.",
        "Reva: Honey, you have to hear it, because Jonathan constantly finding ways to hang around you is not an act or a game. He has feelings for you, Tammy, real feelings.",
        "Tammy: I know, okay? I know!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: When I first heard you hooked up with the guy who murdered the love of your life, I admit, I was surprised. But then I realized that Alan pretty much gets what he wants and he obviously wanted you.",
        "Beth: Alan-Michael, your father simply wants to put this family back together. The Spaulding's are in shambles.",
        "Alan-Michael: That's nothing new, Beth.",
        "Beth: Gus and Harley have seized control of the company. Alan has been marginalized. Even Alex has been shut out. And Lizzie... Lizzie has been co- opted. The family needs you, Alan Michael.",
        "Alan-Michael: The family needs me or you do?",
        "Beth: Make peace with your father. Please. Help him to put things right.",
        "Alan-Michael: What if I think they're right now?",
        "Beth: No, you can't!",
        "Alan-Michael: I do. I'm not Phillip. He was always looking for Alan's approval. Me? I don't give a damn and I'll tell you something else, you are a beautiful woman, Beth, and I've always liked you. But I don't care what you think, either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Done. Finally. Now I just want to get out of here and go home and be alone with you, my husband.",
        "Gus: I was thinking that maybe we could go on a little double date.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: It is strictly business between the two of us from now on. I mean we can be civil with one another, but no more, okay?",
        "Mallet: Civil? Don't you think that's taking it too far?",
        "Dinah: Maybe so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Dinah is not going out on a date with Mallet. She hates him. She keeps saying he gives her a rash or something.",
        "Gus: Maybe it's a love rash. You didn't exactly like me when we met. You hated my guts.",
        "Harley: Deservedly so.",
        "Gus: Well, I'm just saying. Let's ask them to go out with us. You never know. We'll see what happens.",
        "Harley: It hurts me to think about that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: You ready to go, sweetie? Hi. Sorry, we were just leaving. Didn't mean to stay so long.",
        "Danny: I lied.",
        "Michelle: What do you mean?",
        "Danny: When you left town, I tried to move on, but I couldn't I couldn't get you out of my head. I couldn't get you out of my heart and Marina saw that. I didn't. I didn't want to see it. But I can't live without you.",
        "Michelle: Does that mean that...",
        "Danny: I can't stop loving you.",
        "Michelle: Can you do me a favor?",
        "Danny: What?",

        "Reva: You know how Jonathan feels? Then everything's okay? You don't have to let him get to you.",

        "Sandy: Might be a good time for you to take off. Thanks for coming, though.",
        "Jonathan: Just stop. You must be really happy, Sandy.",
        "Sandy: Yeah. It's a great feeling. If you let yourself, maybe you'll feel it too someday.",
        "Jonathan: For once you might be right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Tammy, you have a whole life ahead of you-- a life with Sandy surrounded by people who love you, a person couldn't ask for a better chance at happiness than that. So just concentrate on that, okay? Focus on that and not on Jonathan.",
        "Tammy: But he's...",
        "Reva: I know. I know, hard to get out of your mind, right? Because he still knows how to push your buttons. He knows how to stir things up in you. I understand that, honey, but time will change that, okay? It will, trust me on that. It will change. In the meantime, just try, try not to hate him, okay?",
        "Tammy: Hate him? I've prayed to hate him.",
        "Reva: What?",
        "Tammy: It would be so much easier if I just wanted to kill Jonathan every time I saw him or if I was afraid of him, but I love him Aunt Reva. I love him so much.",
