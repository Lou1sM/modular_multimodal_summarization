        "Buzz and Alan found Phillip shot and bleeding on the floor at Company. Everyone arrived that Phillip had told to meet him at 9 (except for Harley), including Gus, Beth, Lizzie, Olivia, Rick, Frank, and Bill. Alan accused them all of wanting to kill Phillip and vowed the killer would be caught as Rick and the EMT's worked on Phillip. Olivia told Alan that she hopes Phillip dies for what he did to them. They all realized that he played them all off one another. Buzz and Olivia worried about where their kids are. Gus worried about where Harley was and snapped at Frank. Harley arrived late and, when hearing that Phillip was dead, told Gus that she did a bad thing. Lizzie blamed herself for not getting on the plane. At the hospital, Phillip's family and friends waited, and then the doctor told them that Phillip had died.",
        "Reva visited Sandy's place, thinking he might have left town, hoping to still be friends with him, but he told her there is nothing between them, which hurt her feelings. Sandy consoled Tammy, who is hiding out in shame. Jonathan wondered to Olivia if she shot Phillip and hinted he might have done it himself. Later, Reva told Jonathan how much she cared for Sandy, how upset she was at what Sandy said to her and about Phillip's being shot. Cassie and Jeffrey returned from their trip to Chicago, having had no luck in finding Tammy. Edmund was jealous of their being together and upset that Cassie seems to be pushing him away lately. Cassie snapped at him that she doesn't have time for his jealousy right now. Dinah let slip to an outraged Cassie that Edmund met her when she first came to town. Meanwhile, Holly tried to escape her prison by feigning unconsciousness but Sebastian stopped her. He brought her a new dress to wear. After throwing it back at him, she put it on and played nice to her captor."

        "Sandy: Okay. Reality check. Tammy, you can't close yourself off from the rest of the world forever.",

        "Buzz: I haven't seen her.",
        "Gus: I think we should get in touch with her, don't you?",
        "Alan: He's bleeding terribly. Would you stop talking about Harley and help your brother, please?",

        "Gus: What are all these people doing here?",
        "Beth: He told me to be here at 9:00, but he told me nobody else would be here.",
        "Gus: He must have told everybody the same thing.",
        "Lizzie: He told us all to be here. What was supposed to happen?",

        "Sebastian: If you want me dead, Holly, you've got to stand in line. Because this disease has dibs on me. Come on.",
        "Holly: Where'd you go?",
        "Sebastian: I had... I was trying to get a lead on Michelle and Tony.",
        "Holly: No luck? Dr. Ed isn't coming to save you?",
        "Sebastian: Save you, you mean. You know, I thought we had a moment during your... that slideshow of your life.",
        "Holly: When? Was that before or after you tried to hit me?",
        "Sebastian: I stopped myself.",
        "Holly: Why? You idolize your father. Roger never had a problem hitting me.",

        "Holly: This whole thing isn't about Roger?",
        "Sebastian: No! Look at me, Holly! Look at me. I'm standing in front of you. Me. I have your life in my hands. Roger is dead; I'm not. I thought you'd appreciate a change of clothes. Your choice.",

        "Edmund: How was the trip?",
        "Cassie: Is she here? Have you seen her at all?",
        "Edmund: I take it by that you didn't find Tammy?",
        "Cassie: No, she wasn't there, Edmund.",

        "Jeffrey: Okay.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, why aren't you letting me help you?",

        "Alan: Can we do this any faster? Come on, guys.",
        "EMT: We can't, sir.",
        "Lizzie: Mommy, he's not moving.",
        "Beth: He'll be okay, sweetie. Your father wouldn't leave us. He wouldn't do that.",

        "Bill: Hey, what's...",
        "Gus: What are you doing here?",

        "Gus: You worry about who pulled the trigger, I'll worry about where he stashed our kids!",
        "Frank: I'll take that. It could be evidence.",
        "Alan: How much longer is this going to take?",
        "EMT: We can't transport him until he's stabilized.",
        "Bill: Why the heck would he want everybody here? Phillip was really up to something.",

        "Rick: Get another set of vitals. What's his pressure?",
        "Alan: Don't give up, Phillip. Don't give up.",
        "Olivia: Listen do you. Don't give up. They're doing everything they can for you, pal. \"Please, Daddy, be okay.\" You're so concerned about the Spaulding prince, but where are our children? Do you remember them?",
        "Alan: Those children are fine.",
        "Olivia: Where we going to find them, Alan? He's the only one with who knows where they are and he doesn't look like he wants to share right now. Not that he ever would. Well, you go ahead and wring your hands and cry over this horrible thing. But as for me, I hope he dies!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: No way. I don't want to see her.",
        "Sandy: Great.",
        "Tammy: What?",
        "Sandy: She's looking for my spare key.",
        "Tammy: I can't see her, Sandy.",
        "Sandy: Well, you'd better get hiding because she'll be coming in any minute. Hey, Reva.",
        "Reva: I... I knocked, but there wasn't any answer.",
        "Sandy: I guess I didn't hear you. Not that it matters at all.",
        "Reva: I wouldn't have used this key if I hadn't thought that you'd left... town, I mean.",
        "Sandy: And if I left, why would you want to come in at all?",
        "Reva: To see if you might have left a forwarding address that I could reach you at or... I'm... do I really have to stand out there and explain this to you?",
        "Sandy: Okay, all right. It's just that I'm in the middle of something.",
        "Reva: I won't be long. I'm really glad that you're still here. I know that things haven't really been easy between us, especially lately. But we do have a friendship, if nothing else. And it's not so strange to want to hang on to that, is it?",
        "Sandy: Yes. Yes, it is, Reva.",
        "Reva: Why?",
        "Sandy: Why don't we just stop all the pretending? There's nothing between us. There never was.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I don't want to fight with you, Edmund, okay? And I am sorry if I hurt you. But with Tammy missing, I don't have the energy to constantly reassure you that Edmund Winslow is the only man in my life, okay? We're all tired. Let's talk about this in the morning, all right?",
        "Jeffrey: Edmund, Cassie and I...",
        "Cassie: Is she staying out of it, Edmund? Because this is all making sense to me now.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, Dinah has nothing to do with this. I couldn't love Tammy more if she were my own daughter. I'm not trying to make it more difficult.",
        "Cassie: And she is missing, Edmund! And that's all I care about. And I will take all the help I can get, do you understand that?",
        "Edmund: And I've been wanting to help you. Why aren't you letting me help you? You keep shutting me out!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: Do what you want with the dress. Wear it or tear it into strips and make a rope so that you can escape out the window.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Get out!",
        "Gus: Don't make it any worse, all right, Alan?",
        "Olivia: Come on, Gus, that's a Spaulding specialty.",
        "Lizzie: Get out of here before you get shot.",
        "Bill: Maybe I should get you out of here.",
        "Olivia: They feel the same way I do. Admit it.",
        "Beth: None of us wants Phillip to die.",
        "Olivia: He kidnapped our children, people. Guess what? He wasn't going to give them back. He said he would, but it was a lie. No, it was worse than that, it was a scam.",
        "Alan: I'm warning you, Olivia.",
        "Frank: Olivia, what are you talking about?",
        "Olivia: Phillip asked me to show up with him for a one on one meeting, but the joint is full. This is a set-up.",
        "Gus: Why did he do it? What was the point?",
        "Olivia: It's easy. He wanted to turn us into what he was, a hypocrite.",
        "Alan: I'm not listening to this.",
        "Olivia: He would go on and on in that solemn way of his about doing all the right things but deep down all he wanted was power, getting what he wanted, to hell with anyone else. And tonight he proved we're no better than he is, right? I cut a deal with him.",
        "Frank: What are you talking about? What do you mean, a deal?",
        "Olivia: Phillip made a very special appearance in an elevator at towers earlier. He said I could have my little girl back. All I had to do was show up at 9:00, but I wasn't allowed to tell any of the other parents about it. It was for me and me alone, this deal. So I took it. I lied to get my little girl back. But I wasn't the only one who was offered that deal, was I, Beth? And what about you, Rick? You would do anything to get your son back, right? Including stab people in the back who were in the same boat as you are? But see, the joke's on us, because he never had any intention of giving us our children back. He just wanted to prove a point on his way out of town, to turn us all against each other. I guess that Harley was the only one smart enough not to fall for it. You keep him alive long enough for him to tell me where my daughter is, and then after that he can go straight to hell!",
        "Bill: Olivia....",
        "Olivia: No! I just need some air.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, killer. Where'd you ditch the gun?",
        "EMT: We're almost ready to transport.",
        "Rick: Everybody, just move back so we can get him on the gurney.",
        "Gus: What can I do?",
        "Rick: Make sure we've got a good seal on that...",
        "Frank: Is that Phillip's phone?",
        "Gus: Yeah, I assume you want to take a look at that.",
        "Frank: I would. I'd like to find more than his phone right now. There's no gun, no casings, nothing pointing to the shooter. Let's hope he comes to so we can--so he can tell us who pulled the trigger. Any ideas?",
        "Gus: Your guess is as good as mine, Frank.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Where is this coming from?",
        "Sandy: From the way you look at me, Reva. I can't handle this guilt. What do you want from me?",
        "Reva: I don't know.",
        "Sandy: Then leave me alone. All I've done from day one is lie to you.",
        "Reva: I guess that's true, but...",
        "Sandy: I even lied to myself. I knew the truth would come out sooner or later and it has. I'm not your son! I'm not your son! I'm nothing to you.",
        "Reva: Do you really believe that?",
        "Sandy: You would have figured it out eventually.",
        "Reva: I'm not so sure. You had me convinced. If my real son hadn't showed up to spoil it for you, and for me...",
        "Sandy: Well, good, old Jonathan did us a big favor, didn't he? He forced it into the open before it got out of hand.",
        "Reva: Out of hand? You mean, it being important or meaningful, precious?",
        "Sandy: Well, look at it this way: Now you can cut your losses before you got really invested.",
        "Reva: I am invested, Sandy. Otherwise, I wouldn't have come here so pathetically looking for some scrap of paper with an address or a number on it so that I could... so that I wouldn't lose you completely.",
        "Sandy: No, no, no. See, no. We can't do this. You know what's going to happen if we have some kind of relationship. You're not going to ever trust me again. You're going to be wondering if I'm telling the truth. And then a couple of months from now you're going to think to yourself, \"what on earth was I thinking? Why am I wasting my time on this clown?\" And you're going to want to get rid of me.",
        "Reva: Or not.",
        "Sandy: So thanks, but no thanks.",
        "Reva: There's something else going on here.",
        "Sandy: No, I'm done. We're done. Just... please leave, Reva.",
        "Reva: Okay.",
        "Sandy: And do me a favor. Put this on the mat back where it was.",
        "Reva: I won't bother you anymore.",
        "Sandy: Thank you.",
        "Reva: Good-bye.",
        "Tammy: What was that? I wanted Reva out of here, not out of your life.",
        "Sandy: It's okay. Had to be done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: It looks like the bullets exited through his back which means they didn't lodge into vital organs or his spine. And that'll help us in the ER.",
        "Alan: That's good news?",
        "Rick: I don't know. We'll do everything we can.",
        "EMT: Roll him on three, one, two, three.",
        "Rick: Be very careful. Watch the lines. Thanks.",
        "Bill: I don't know, Buzz, he doesn't look too good.",
        "Buzz: None of us look too good. Why worry about that?",
        "Frank: What's on your mind?",
        "Gus: I'm trying to figure out who did this, Frank.",
        "Frank: What are you talking about? Every single person in the room had a reason to do this to him.",
        "Gus: He was horrible to your family and everybody in this room.",
        "Frank: Yeah and not to mention, to a lot of people not here.",
        "Gus: Come on, Harley. Where are you?",
        "Lizzie: I could have stopped this, mom.",
        "Beth: What?",
        "Lizzie: If I just went on this plane, I could have stopped it.",
        "Beth: Lizzie, no, uh-uh.",
        "Lizzie: If I had went on that plane I would have been wherever he wanted to take us. He wouldn't be lying here on the floor. It's my fault he's hurt.",
        "Beth: No, it's not your fault.",
        "Lizzie: I told him that I was sorry that I couldn't go with him. The last thing he told me was that he was sorry, too.",
        "Beth: Honey, honey, look at me. You did what you thought was best. That's all anyone can do. This wasn't your fault. Maybe it was just bound to happen no matter what.",
        "Olivia: What, you think... you think that I...",
        "Jonathan: You shot your big bad ex-husband? Why not? From what you said last night it sounds like he had it coming.",
        "Olivia: How did you know he was shot? What are you doing here anyway?",
        "Jonathan: Well, I showed up for food, but I stayed for the show. I overheard some cops talking about how Phillip Spaulding caught a couple slugs.",
        "Olivia: They ought to be bringing him out in a minute.",
        "Jonathan: Dead or alive?",
        "Olivia: Alive, so far.",
        "Jonathan: I'm impressed. After I told you last night that you shouldn't let this guy get away with stealing your daughter, I didn't think that a handgun was a solution, but you've never been any one to pursue things halfway, have you?",
        "Olivia: That conversation that we had, that never happened.",
        "Jonathan: Are you sure? I remember every word.",
        "Olivia: If you're thinking of using this against me, forget it.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, I'm not going to do that. I'm on your side. And your kid's.",
        "Olivia: I just want my daughter back and I'll do whatever it takes to make that happen.",
        "Jonathan: Was that a confession?",
        "Olivia: Where were you tonight?",
        "Jonathan: (Laughs) you think that I popped the guy? Olivia:(Laughs) well, why not? You seem to get off on being a predator.",
        "Jonathan: Wow, I really do have a bad rep, huh? What if I did do it? For you.",
        "Olivia: What?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. What if murder's no big thing to me and I wanted to prove to you that I was on your side?",
        "Olivia: Is that a confession?",
        "Jonathan: Where were you tonight?",
        "Rick: Watch it.",
        "Frank: Come this way. Let's go.",

        "Edmund: We were supposed to be getting married, Cassie. Your problems should be our problems.",
        "Cassie: Edmund, I understand that, and I am not trying to push you away.",
        "Jeffrey: Call me if you find any news about Tammy, and I'll do the same.",
        "Cassie: Thank you.",
        "Edmund: Leaving so soon, Mr. O'Neill?",
        "Cassie: You know what? Stop it! I don't know if I was more relieved or crushed that Tammy wasn't in that strip club in Chicago, but I just knew I could come here and have you to lean on.",
        "Edmund: You do. You can lean on me. That's my...",
        "Cassie: No, she's by herself, Edmund, and you're doing this to me. Your next wave of paranoia.",
        "Dinah: You know what? You're as selfish as ever. Do you always treat the men you love like dirt?",
        "Cassie: This is none of your business. Get the hell out of here before I call security, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: Not that you deserve it, but that man is very loyal to you. He is caring and determined, and you take him for granted. When I first came to town, he bent over backwards to help me, and he had absolutely no idea who I was.",
        "Cassie: What do you mean, \"when you first came to town?\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Hey, Mom. What's got you so rattled?",
        "Reva: I just had a call from the TV station where I work. My boss, Phillip Spaulding, was shot tonight at company, and I... I just can't believe it.",
        "Jonathan: Right. The Phillip dude. They took him out of company on a stretcher.",
        "Reva: You were there at company?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. (Laughs) not guilty. Not guilty. I was talking to Aunt Olivia. They brought this guy out on a stretcher. It was not pretty. He was all gray and...",
        "Reva: Wait, Olivia was there?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. She was pretty freaked out. But I said maybe it's for the best, you know? This guy sounded like he's a real jerk.",
        "Reva: No he wasn't.",
        "Jonathan: You're upset. Is Phillip one of your X's dropped off the list?",
        "Reva: No. No, he's a friend. At least he was a friend. People change.",
        "Jonathan: So Phillip is why you're so upset when I walked up?",
        "Reva: Yeah, him. And Sandy.",
        "Jonathan: Sandman. What happened to him?",
        "Reva: You really want to know?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah.",
        "Reva: Of course you'd want to know. I think you'll get a real kick out of this. I paid him a visit and he as much as told me to get lost. That he didn't want me to be a part of his life anymore. Oh, yeah, right. No big deal, huh? People come, people go.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, they do.",
        "Reva: That's not the way it is with me. I don't like to lose someone that I've opened my heart to. But with you, it's all just fun, isn't it? Well, congratulations. You can check Sandy off your list. You win. Oh, no, don't. Deny that? No, don't. It's what you wanted. Just call it a mother's intuition.",

        "Buzz: See you at the hospital.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Frank: Hey, Brian, I need you to secure the whole place here, okay, for forensics?",
        "Brian: I'm on it.",
        "Frank: Good job. If there are any reporters around here, refer them to me.",
        "Brian: Chief, you're pretty close to this. Are you sure you want to...?",
        "Frank: You know what, Brian? It's my investigation, okay?",
        "Gus: That's basically it. Just call me back as soon as you can, okay? Thanks.",
        "Frank: Was that Harley?",
        "Gus: No. Who are you putting on this case?",
        "Frank: I've got Bigalow and Stein doing the legwork. I'm going to take the lead on this case. Are you sure you're okay?",
        "Gus: I'm just getting sick. I'm... I don't know how to feel, Frank. You know?",
        "Frank: Yeah, I know what you mean. Listen, I'm going to run to the hospital, okay? Hopefully Phillip will come to and be able to I.D. The shooter and tell us where those kids are.",
        "Gus: Well, that would make your job a lot easier, wouldn't it?",
        "Frank: Gus, I know he's your brother, and I don't mean to be insensitive.",
        "Gus: You don't need to worry about it. Just do your thing, Frank. I understand.",

        "Gunshot wound to the upper chest. I got him. Rick, Phillip is your best friend. I need to...",
        "Dr. Caron: No, that's not the right choice. Not in the condition you're in. Call upstairs and tell them to load the stand by O.R. team.",
        "Rick: Dr. Caron is going to be working on him. I can't do it right now. I just can't.",

        "Dr. Caron: We're going to do everything we can, I promise.",
        "Alan: Just say a prayer that he comes back to us. (Voices indistinct) (gunshot)",

        "Phillip: Relax. I'm still here.",
        "Alan: Where are you?",
        "Phillip: Where I am doesn't matter. It's where you need to be. Be at company at 9:00. Don't tell anyone or James will be gone when you get there and you will not see him again.",
        "Beth: What have you done to our son?",
        "Phillip: He's safe.",
        "Beth: Please don't do this.",
        "Phillip: You're my firstborn. I would die for you.",
        "Lizzie: You're squeezing me. Please let me go. If I would have went on that plane, I could've stopped it, Mom.",
        "Rick: I'm sorry it had to be this way, buddy.",
        "Phillip: I've been treating you people with kid gloves. Why should I do that after what you put my family through?",
        "Buzz: What we've put your family through?",
        "Bill: You don't do that to my family, not anymore.",
        "Olivia: No! No!",
        "Bill: Listen to me, he cannot do this, it's illegal. We'll fight him every step of the way.",
        "Olivia: As for me, I hope he dies!",
        "Rick: Phillip....",
        "Alan: He's going to be all right. Do you understand me? When he regains consciousness he is going to tell us which one of you did this to him!",

        "Holly: Actually, I want to apologize.",
        "Sebastian: Well, I did not expect that.",

        "Tammy: You didn't mean that, Sandy, what you said to Reva.",

        "Tammy: I'm sorry.",
        "Sandy: Hey, you know what? You don't have time for apologies. You have to think about what's your next move.",

        "Reva: Go ahead. Have your fun. You've been gunning for Sandy since you came to town.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I have and for a good reason. This kid waves at me when I fall off a mountain, gets on the jet, comes over here and tries to take the life that's supposed to be mine. So, yeah, good riddance. It's for the best, believe me.",
        "Reva: You know, that's funny. He said the same thing.",
        "Jonathan: Well, these ungrateful kids.",
        "Reva: And I have a real knack for finding them. And having them.",
        "Jonathan: You're better off, believe me.",
        "Reva: Yeah? Thanks.",
        "Jonathan: Sandy's nobody. Sandy's one of those people who just takes up space.",
        "Reva: Sandy made some huge mistakes and, yeah, I should probably be glad he's gone, is that it? Well, he was a good....",
        "Jonathan: What, he was a good son?",
        "Reva: Friend. He was a good friend. He was good to Shayne after he had his accident and he was good to me. And I'll miss him.",
        "Jonathan: Hey.",

        "Jonathan: However terrible you think I am, Sandy's the one that hurt you. I don't know. I just wish...",

        "Dinah: Yes and no.",
        "Edmund: The answer is yes. I met Dinah before I knew who she really was. She introduced herself to me as Dee. At the time, I think I thought she was just someone who needed my help.",
        "Cassie: What kind of help?",
        "Edmund: She needed a place to stay and I gave it to her.",
        "Cassie: So that time I found her in your apartment, that wasn't the first time? She had been there before? You... you were taking care of Dinah? Dinah Marler, who stalked me, impersonated me and tried to kill me?",
        "Edmund: Apparently I was.",
