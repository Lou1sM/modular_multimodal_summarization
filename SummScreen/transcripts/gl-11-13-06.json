        "Jeffrey: You got pregnant from that night?",
        "Olivia: Yeah, how about that? First time out of the box. Don't worry about it, I got rid of her.",
        "Jeffrey: I had no idea.",
        "Olivia: From the moment I met you and fell for your little charmer act, everything I was and thought and felt changed forever. Why did you have to be there that night, Jeffrey? No, why did you have to be there?",
        "Jeffrey: Stop it! (Knock on the door)",
        "Harley: Everything okay?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah.",
        "Harley: I just thought that you might want to know that attempt on Blake's life was actually aimed at you. Someone put poison in your drink, Jeffrey. Can you think of anyone who might want to see you dead? Can you think of anybody who might be happy to have poison coursing through your veins?",
        "Jeffrey: Who doesn't want me dead, Harley? People who've worked with me, people I've put away, people who don't like my singing. There's a long list of suspects.",
        "Harley: You need to be more specific because that drink was definitely intended for you.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I'll have to give it some thought.",
        "Harley: Olivia?",
        "Olivia: No, the Beacon didn't cater that event, I don't know.",
        "Harley: Okay, I'll be in touch. And until then, Jeffrey, be careful.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. Thanks a lot. I've got you on speed dial.",
        "Harley: Okay.",
        "Olivia: Why didn't you tell her about me?",
        "Jeffrey: Maybe I'm still trying to figure this out.",
        "Olivia: What's to figure out, Jeffrey? You forced yourself on me and got me pregnant when I was just a teenager. I've been paying for it ever since. You know what, I think it's your turn.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I said I'm coming! Jerk. Okay, I need two vodka martinis, one very dry. I have no idea what the other one is. I didn't write it down.",
        "Customer: Miss, can we get some lime over here?",
        "Lizzie: I heard you. I'm coming.",
        "Customer: And some ice.",
        "Lizzie: Please, please let me have Roxy lick his ice. Please.",
        "Jonathan: No, I'm sorry.",
        "Lizzie: I can't do this.",
        "Jonathan: Sure you can. You're doing better than I thought you would.",
        "Lizzie: Really?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah.",
        "Customer: Hey, where's Tammy? That girl really knew her stuff.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: What's wrong with the shower curtain I picked out?",
        "Remy: Besides the fact that it's pink and yellow, it has ruffles.",
        "Tammy: It's better than the plastic one you got.",
        "Remy: What's wrong with it?",
        "Tammy: It's clear. You can see right through it. What if you were to walk in on me taking a shower?",
        "Remy: That would be horrible. Hey, you can't hit me in front of your mom.",
        "Tammy: Uh-oh, they look serious. Should we say hi or run?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Well, who's going to take care of her if you're not with her?",
        "Billy: She's got some professionals in there, said she doesn't want me wasting any more time with her.",
        "Cassie: I'm sorry, Billy.",
        "Billy: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: You know what, she's just been through so much. Why don't you give her some time? I'm sure she's going to change her mind.",
        "Billy: I don't think so. She's recovering, and we both know what the next step is, don't we?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Reva. How did you even get here?",
        "Reva: Car service. The stairs, however, were quite a negotiation.",
        "Josh: You shouldn't push yourself.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, you know me, I always do what I'm not supposed to do.",
        "Josh: Cassie's not here.",
        "Reva: I'm here to see you.",
        "Josh: Okay, why don't we go downstairs then? I'll build you a fire.",
        "Reva: You don't need to do that. It's plenty warm right here.",
        "Josh: Here you go.",
        "Reva: Thanks. I'm feeling better, I just get tired.",
        "Josh: You know you don't have to pretend to be strong anymore.",
        "Reva: Well, that's just me, I'm always doing what I'm not supposed to do.",
        "Josh: Why don't you sit down.",
        "Reva: I'm really not as fragile as you think I am.",
        "Josh: I would never call you fragile, Reva.",
        "Reva: Good.",
        "Josh: So, you want to tell me why you're here?",
        "Reva: You sound like you already know.",
        "Josh: Educated guess. You're in remission, you've got your life back, and now you want the rest of it back.",
        "Reva: You mean, do I want you back?",
        "Josh: Where's Billy?",
        "Reva: We're not going to live together anymore. He deserves so much more than I can give him.",
        "Josh: You are unbelievable, really, you are. I can't believe... (laughs) You know what, never mind.",
        "Reva: No, go, say it.",
        "Josh: No.",
        "Reva: No, please, say it. Because I'm not on my death bed anymore, so just say what it is you need to say.",
        "Josh: What would that be, exactly? That you pushing me away when you were so sick was selfish and irresponsible and almost cost you your life? I don't actually feel like I need to say that again.",
        "Reva: Just like I don't need to say how it feels to be here in this bedroom that you share with my sister.",
        "Josh: Why are you here? You want to just pretend like the last few months didn't happen, pick up where we left off?",
        "Reva: No. We can't go back to the way it was.",
        "Josh: Then why are you here? Because I got to tell you something, I'm tired, too. You exhaust me. All of your complications...",
        "Reva: Life is complicated.",
        "Josh: It doesn't have to be. I loved you. I wanted our marriage to work. This time I would have done anything for you. It's that simple.",
        "Reva: You can say that? Here?",
        "Josh: Reva, I never would have given up on us if... I never dreamed that anything or anyone could make me as happy as... but I've experienced a different way of living now, a different way of loving someone, and I am happy. Cassie makes me happy.",
        "Reva: But do you love her, Joshua? Do you love her the way you love me?",
        "Josh: No, I don't. Cassie is a different person. I love her in a completely different way, but I do love her very much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Look, I don't want to tell you what to do, but I just know what I know.",
        "Cassie: Hey.",
        "Tammy: Hey.",
        "Cassie: How are you? What are you up to?",
        "Tammy: Stocking up on stuff for the new place. This guy probably has the worst taste in the world.",
        "Remy: That leather recliner was tight.",
        "Tammy: It had a refrigerator in the armrest.",
        "Remy: That's a bad thing?",
        "Cassie: Do you guys like the new place?",
        "Tammy: Yeah. It's a change.",
        "Billy: There's a lot of that going around. I'll see you all later.",
        "Tammy: What's with him?",
        "Cassie: Oh, nothing. Reva's recovery is wonderful and amazing, but it's also a little confusing.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, I can see that.",
        "Cassie: But it's nothing to worry about, so I'll talk to you tomorrow. I love you.",
        "Tammy: It never...",
        "Remy: Do you want to talk to her?",
        "Tammy: What I really want to do is get the rest of the stuff on our list tonight.",
        "Remy: It's a nice idea, but all of the stores are closed.",
        "Tammy: Well, who says we have to go to a store?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Damn it!",
        "Jonathan: I'll get it. I'll get it.",
        "Lizzie: No. No, I can do this. I can't bend over anymore.",
        "Jonathan: You're pregnant, it happens.",
        "Lizzie: I can't do anything right. You have done so much for me, I can't even repay you by taking some stupid drink orders.",
        "Jonathan: Look, you've had people doing things for you your entire life. Now, welcome to the life of being my wife. It rhymes and it will make you cry.",
        "Lizzie: Great.",
        "Jonathan: What is that?",
        "Lizzie: It's Tammy's list for how to run the bar. You had it stored away like it was some sacred document. It tells me how to open the bar, close the bar, clean up the bar, cut lemons the right way...",
        "Jonathan: You should have that memorized. Lighten up okay? I'm kidding. You don't lighten up, you're going to upset the baby, which, by the way, is something you're doing a very good job of.",
        "Lizzie: What?",
        "Jonathan: Being a mom, wow.",
        "Lizzie: Come here. Thank you. I'm a bad waitress.",
        "Customer: There she is. Where have you been all my life?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: So you poisoned my drink?",
        "Olivia: You poisoned everything. But then you can't go to the police and tell them why I hate you because then they would discover the real Jeffrey O'Neill.",
        "Jeffrey: That night ruined my life, too, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: Oh, please. Please. They protected you. They gave you a great life. They paid you to live in a palace and be a prince. What did I get?",
        "Jeffrey: You have no idea what I was going through.",
        "Olivia: I don't care. It wasn't enough. Not nearly enough pain. Not yet.",
        "Jeffrey: So what now? Are you going to try kill me again? I need to watch my back?",
        "Olivia: Maybe I'll just turn you in.",
        "Jeffrey: No, you won't because you would have already done that.",
        "Olivia: Stop talking to me like you know me. You are not in control of the situation.",
        "Jeffrey: Neither are you.",
        "Olivia: You tried to run from what you did once, Jeffrey. I'm not going to let you do it again. Not this time. (Knock at the door)",
        "Aide: Mr. O'Neill, we've got that interview in 15 minutes.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, I'll be right out. Well, I just don't know what to say...",
        "Olivia: I can't look at you without wanting to...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: You are right, you certainly do have some nice hands. You are a quick learner.",
        "Ava: Thank you. I'm stubborn, right?",
        "Coop: No kidding, I noticed.",
        "Ava: I don't give up. I don't give up. I had a tough life, you know? Don't underestimate me.",
        "Coop: All right, give me a pass. Show me your arm.",
        "Ava: Ready, ready, go!",
        "Olivia: Ow!",
        "Ava: Oh, my God! I'm so sorry. Are you okay? I didn't mean to. It was an accident.",
        "Olivia: It's never anybody's fault, is it? Ow!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Al, Marvin, good to see you guys again. The drinks are on me, okay? (Laughter) I didn't know you'd be here tonight. I have some stuff to get out of the back room.",
        "Jonathan: For the new apartment?",
        "Tammy: Yeah.",
        "Remy: We'll be out of here in a minute.",
        "Jonathan: Take your time.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, it's totally cool, Tammy. Just do whatever you have to do.",
        "Billy: What, are you guys following me around? Hey, what happened to the music, kemosabe? That's better.",
        "Jonathan: No, that's better. You know where everything is back there?",
        "Remy: Yeah, she knows.",
        "Lizzie: Can we get you guys some drinks?",
        "Remy: No, we're not staying long.",
        "Billy: Ooh, everybody's having fun tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Wow, Olivia, are you okay?",
        "Olivia: Somebody hurls a ball at my head and you're asking me if I'm okay?",
        "Coop: Look, just please take it easy.",
        "Olivia: It's fine. Do whatever you want to me, I'll just let it go. I'll let it sit inside and fester like nothing ever happened.",
        "Ava: Is everything okay here?",
        "Olivia: Is Buzz in here?",
        "Coop: No. No, he's actually out at the moment. Ava, do you want to come inside and help me finish packing for my trip?",
        "Ava: No, I'm going to stay out here and wait for you. I'm all right. I'm okay.",
        "Olivia: Can't talk to you right now.",
        "Ava: I don't want to fight with you right now.",
        "Olivia: Good.",
        "Ava: Good.",
        "Olivia: What do you want?",
        "Ava: From you? Nothing, since you're not going to give me answers about how I came into this world, I'll just have to find another source, like my father.",
        "Olivia: What more could you possibly want to know?",
        "Ava: A name would be fantastic.",
        "Olivia: You want the name of the guy who forced himself on me?",
        "Ava: I need to know. I need some closure, some closure on this pile of garbage that you've loaded in my lap. You know, I knew you weren't going to understand.",
        "Olivia: You are setting yourself up for such heartache.",
        "Ava: It's my right.",
        "Olivia: Well, you know what, it's a stupid thing to do. Look at your life, look at what you have. You have a great guy who adores you. You have a job that you like. Why go digging into the past? I'm telling you, you need to let this go, otherwise...",
        "Alan-Michael: And I took you for the cheerleader type.",
        "Ava: I hate cheerleaders. Coop is teaching me how to play football because there's some Cooper Thanksgiving festivities coming up. I don't know.",
        "Alan-Michael: The Cooper Thanksgiving game. I know it well. I've been nailed by Frank once or twice in the name of togetherness. What families do to each other, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: It has been a very difficult night for all of us. But I do hope that we can look to the future. I do hope that we can overcome the things that divided us. We have a lot to prove, and I will do everything that I can to make sure that this city is...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Oh, I didn't even know I had them on. I didn't. They gave me my belongings at the hospital and I just put it on without even thinking.",
        "Josh: You sure about that?",
        "Reva: I'm not sure about anything. I don't know... I don't know what I want. I don't know why I'm here. I don't know anything. I just know that I didn't expect to be alive.",
        "Josh: I know.",
        "Reva: And to try to think about tomorrow is difficult when I never even thought that there was going to be a today.",
        "Josh: Thank God there is one.",
        "Reva: Thank God.",
        "Josh: So, why are you here? What do you want?",
        "Reva: I don't know (laughs) I guess I just came to see what it's like for us here, now, you know, in the real world with a future.",
        "Josh: And what's it like?",
        "Reva: It's like us. Like it's always been.",
        "Josh: We can't go back, Reva. I can't go back. I live here with Cassie. This is my life now; this is my future. But Cassie and I want to help you in any way that we can.",
        "Reva: Pity. Yeah. That's exactly what I want from you.",
        "Josh: Careful. Easy.",

        "Gina Tognoni, \"Inside The Light.\" What makes Mallet Dinah's dream guy? Well the fact that he makes her laugh and that he's incredibly handsome. He's good to her. He respects here. He's a little crazy, but that's what makes them work. I think that Dinah and Mallet can withstand whatever you throw them. They're a pretty good pair. See Dinah, Wednesday, November 15, \"Inside The Light.\"",

        "Josh: Hi.",
        "Cassie: Hi yourself. And you, what are you doing out tonight?",
        "Josh: I just asked her the same question.",
        "Reva: I'm just having tea, visiting family.",
        "Cassie: You really should be taking care of your health, Reva.",
        "Reva: I am. You think I'm not going to do that now? I am. I'm eating right, and I'm doing everything I'm supposed to be doing. And I just came here to try to figure out what I'm going to do with this second chance that God has seen fit to give me. I should go. My car is waiting.",
        "Cassie: Why don't you let me help you?",
        "Reva: No, no, no, it's fine. I'll see you.",
        "Cassie: Well, I saw Billy. Seems he's looking for a new place to live.",
        "Josh: I heard.",
        "Cassie: Wow, I wish you'd given her some of the green tea because this stuff really isn't good for her.",
        "Josh: Cassie, she came to see me.",
        "Cassie: No kidding, yeah. She looks like she's doing better, though, don't you think? You know what, I just want to ask one favor: The next time you have an intimate conversation with my sister, could you please do it somewhere other than my bedroom?",
        "Josh: Our bedroom.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, we'll see.",

        "Lizzie: Did you get everything you needed?",
        "Tammy: Yeah. When did you start working here?",
        "Lizzie: Tonight's my first night. It's the family business, right?",
        "Tammy: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Remy: I'd come in just to have Lizzie Spaulding wait on me.",
        "Lizzie: I tried to follow your list. It just wasn't my style.",
        "Jonathan: We're just making some changes around here.",
        "Tammy: That's good. Change is good. (Telephone rings)",
        "Jonathan: Outskirts. What? All right, just don't move. I'll be right there, okay? Hey, Billy?",
        "Billy: Yeah?",
        "Jonathan: Could you close up for me?",
        "Billy: No problem.",
        "Jonathan: And could you ask Caitlin to take Lizzie's tables. Come on?",
        "Lizzie: Where are we going?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Oh, little black box. What is that?",
        "Alan-Michael: It's for you. Nothing like a little bling to take a girl's mind off her troubles.",
        "Ava: I can't take that.",
        "Alan-Michael: You don't even know what it is.",
        "Ava: You're right, I don't. And I know that it's not appropriate for me to take little fancy black boxes from my boss, unless you're going to give me a Christmas gift, like a big bonus, and then I will take it.",
        "Alan-Michael: I'll keep that in mind.",
        "Ava: Okay.",
        "Alan-Michael: Sorry if I overstepped. We have a client in the Midwest who's one of the top diamond dealers. He's trying to curry favors and I thought you could use a little cheering up.",
        "Ava: I've got football and I've got Coop.",
        "Alan-Michael: Coop. He doesn't understand why you're trying to find your father.",
        "Ava: He just doesn't want me to get hurt.",
        "Alan-Michael: Well, Coop and I are different. I don't think you need protecting. I think you've been making great choices all along and you'll continue to make them.",
        "Ava: Hey, are you ready?",
        "Alan-Michael: Coop, where are you going? Business or pleasure?",
        "Coop: Business trip, actually.",
        "Ava: Yeah, he's checking out vendors for the restaurant.",

        "Aide: And we've got two more stops to make, and on the way you can make phone calls to constituents and after that...",
        "Jeffrey: No, no, no, stop. No more. Not tonight. No more phone calls, no more stops, no more interviews, nothing. You know what, you can go. Thanks. No, really, just go home, watch TV, do something, just go. Thanks.",
        "Olivia: It was me, Jeffrey. It was me you took everything from.",
        "Jeffrey: It was a terrible thing that I did, but it was one night, and that was it.",
        "Olivia: One night? No, Jeffrey, one night for you, not for me. I left that party pregnant!",

        "Alan-Michael: You ever turned down diamonds?",
        "Olivia: What do you think?",
        "Alan-Michael: Exactly. What kind of a woman does that? I guess we both know the answer to that. Why do you hate her so much?",
        "Olivia: Why do you care?",
        "Alan-Michael: Because I like to know what I'm getting myself into before I make a deal.",
        "Olivia: Okay. Every time I look at her, she's a reminder of the most painful, humiliating time of my life. And then, of course, the nine months of hell afterwards. How's that?",
        "Alan-Michael: Enlightening.",
        "Olivia: I just need a break from her, from everything. I just want her out of my sight. That's all.",
        "Alan-Michael: And that's where I come in?",
        "Olivia: Yeah. I have the name of a guy. He was at the party that night at the Embassy, he's the right age. He could be Ava's father.",
        "Alan-Michael: Could be. This name's bogus.",
        "Olivia: He's a real guy, he was really there, it's a solid lead. I think she should go down there and investigate it, with your help, of course.",
        "Alan-Michael: You want me to mislead her?",
        "Olivia: Who's to say this isn't the guy, Alan-Michael. I mean, it could be days before you know for sure. Days with Ava only, days without Coop.",
        "Alan-Michael: Hey, Ava, where are you?",
        "Ava: I just dropped off Coop at the airport, why?",
        "Alan-Michael: I just got a call from my PI, they have a lead on your father.",
        "Ava: Are you serious?",
        "Alan-Michael: He's down in San Cristobel. I'm going to fly down there and check him out. It seems pretty solid.",
        "Ava: I want to come with you.",
        "Alan-Michael: You sure?",
        "Ava: I'm sure. I want to meet him.",
        "Alan-Michael: Okay, I'll have the jet ready when you are.",
        "Ava: Thank you. Thank you so much. Oh, gosh, Mr. O'Neill, I'm sorry.",
        "Jeffrey: That's okay.",
        "Ava: Hey, are you okay?",
        "Jeffrey: Me?",
        "Ava: Yeah, you just seem a little...",
        "Jeffrey: It's been a long night, that's all.",
        "Ava: I wanted to tell you, I voted for the first time today. I voted for you.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I am honored.",
        "Ava: There's just something about you... I don't know, I just trust you.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that's very nice of you to say.",

        "Josh: Cassie, come on. Now what are you doing? Don't you even want to know what Reva was doing here?",
        "Cassie: Oh, I know what Reva was doing here. She's cut Billy loose and she wants to reclaim her husband.",
        "Josh: Ex-husband, actually.",
        "Cassie: You know what, her message to Billy was perfectly clear. She doesn't want to keep leading him on because what she really wants to do is get back to her life with you.",
        "Josh: Cassie, just stop, now. Listen, just because Reva wants something, it doesn't necessarily mean she's going to get it.",
        "Cassie: Really? Since when? No matter what's happened before, she always gets you back.",
        "Josh: The difference is that before I didn't have you, and now I do.",
        "Cassie: Well, I'm really glad you feel that way.",

        "Reva: It's open. Hey.",
        "Jonathan: You look like hell. How did they let you out of the hospital?",
        "Reva: I love you, too.",
        "Jonathan: Are you nuts?",
        "Reva: No. I'm in remission.",
        "Lizzie: What did you say?",
        "Reva: The cancer is in remission, and God help us all, that it stays that way.",
        "Jonathan: Hey!",
        "Reva: No, no, no. I'm not quite strong enough for you just yet.",
        "Jonathan: I'm sorry. Sorry.",
        "Reva: That's okay. That's okay. (Laughs) And you... I'm going to get to be there with you, right outside that delivery room door when that little baby comes into this world.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, Reva, I am so happy for you, I really am, and for all of us.",
        "Reva: I am really glad to hear you guys say that, because I've been thinking... it's going to take me a while to get my strength back, but.. and you guys have enough of your own stuff that you have to deal with, bringing baby Randall into the world and trying to calm down Alan. So I thought that maybe we would all benefit from working through this together, you know. I've got an idea. Grandma Reva's got an idea, kids. (Laughter) And Alan is not going to like it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Wait, wait, wait. You want me to move out because Reva was here?",
        "Cassie: Look, Harley stopped by earlier. She asked me what would I do if Reva wanted you back. And I told her I would fight like hell for you.",
        "Josh: Okay, great. So what are you doing right now?",
        "Cassie: I'm fighting.",
        "Josh: By asking me... by kicking me out?",
        "Cassie: By saying that if you want to be with Reva to take care of her, then you should go do that. That if you want to live closer, or move back into the old house, or tuck her in at night, then you should do that, and that I will be here. And I know you will come back to me.",
        "Josh: Well, you would be wrong about that. Because I won't come back to you. Cassie, I'm not going anywhere in the first place, okay?",
        "Cassie: But you need to be with her if you're going to help her.",
        "Josh: What I need is to be here, in this room, our room, our house.",
        "Cassie: What exactly did Reva say to you?",
        "Josh: It doesn't matter. She could have said that she wanted me back, she could have said she's desperate to have us back together, but she didn't. And even if she did, it wouldn't have mattered to me. Because the thing is, I love you, Cassie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: So, if you guys are still here after the baby is born...",
        "Jonathan: Still here? This is kind of a wacky idea.",
        "Reva: Is it any less or more wacky than Lizzie moving in with you and Tammy?",
        "Jonathan: Oh, snap.",
        "Lizzie: Zing, right?",
        "Jonathan: Are you sure you want both of us here with you?",
        "Reva: Yes, yes. I can help you with Alan, you know, I mean... and it'll also be good for me because you guys can be here. You can help make sure that I take my medicine and that I get enough sleep, and that I don't fall down the stairs. And I can help you guys. I can bathe the baby. I can change its diaper. But I draw the line at midnight feedings.",
        "Jonathan: What do you think?",
        "Lizzie: I'm totally in. Unless you have a problem with it.",
        "Jonathan: No, no. What boy doesn't want to live with his mother?",
        "Reva: Okay, punk.",
        "Jonathan: No. Who knows, it might be fun. No loud music, okay?",
        "Reva: Whatever.",
        "Jonathan: You run this by Billy yet?",
        "Reva: Billy and I aren't going to be living together.",
        "Jonathan: Who's idea was that, yours or his? No wonder he was in such a funky mood.",
        "Reva: You saw him?",
        "Jonathan: Uh-huh, at Outskirts.",
        "Reva: He wasn't drinking?",
        "Jonathan: No, he was working.",
        "Reva: You need to keep an eye on him. I mean it, Jonathan. Promise me you will watch him closely.",
        "Jonathan: Okay, okay. So, hate to ask an obvious question, but where does Josh fit into this plan?",
        "Reva: We'll save that for another day. Right now the most important thing is that we get you guys moved in here and we bring this baby into the world, and then we'll see what happens.",

        "Becca: You're going to think this is silly, but I walked into that tight little booth and I imagined you in there with me.",

        "Jeffrey: Her? How could Olivia know it was a girl, unless... it's O'Neill. I need a background check on a woman. Olivia Spencer, San Cristobel, 20 years ago. I need you to find out if she had contact with a lawyer who specializes in adoptions or took any kind of steps to give away a baby. All right, get back to me as soon as you can. Thanks. A girl.",
