        "Edmund: Cassie. Leave her alone.",
        "Jeffrey: She needs help, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Leave her alone, I said. Cassie?",
        "Cassie: (Groans) oh, I'm sorry.",
        "Edmund: It's okay, it's okay. Just rest for a minute. Cassie.",
        "Cassie: I'm fine. Look, I'm fine. Yes, I'm okay, you know. I'm fine.",
        "Doctor #2: Excuse me. I'm a doctor. I just checked in. Is there anything I can do?",
        "Cassie: I'm not going to the hospital, okay? I'm not going anywhere like that?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, shh, shh. Would you be willing to see this woman in a room upstairs?",
        "Cassie: Edmund.",
        "Doctor #2: Of course.",
        "Edmund: This way, please.",
        "Dinah: Wow, talk about near misses. A few steps to the left and she could have fallen into your arms.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Dead? My... my son?",
        "Doctor #1: We did everything we could for him. I'm sorry.",
        "Lizzie: No, there's no way.",
        "Alan: Doctor, you don't understand. He was alive when we brought him in. The paramedics said stabilized. He was stabilized! The word they used was \"stabilized.\" He can't be dead, Rick! You've got to go in there!",
        "Rick: He's gone. Alan, he's gone.",
        "Alan: Let go of me!",
        "Beth: Alan, he's gone. Phillip is gone.",
        "Lizzie: It's going to be okay.",
        "Beth: (Crying)",
        "Olivia: Did he say anything?",
        "Doctor #1: No, he never regained consciousness.",
        "Olivia: What abut my daughter? What about Emma? He's the only one who knew where she is, and now he's dead.",
        "Alan: Yes. Yes, Phillip is dead. Maybe it's your fault.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: What do you remember?",
        "Harley: Phillip was shot?",
        "Gus: Yes, he's at the hospital. Talk to me. Talk to me. Tell me what happened.",
        "Harley: I... I... I went looking for Phillip, as Ruth. I thought that I could trick him into telling me where the kids are.",
        "Gus: And did you?",
        "Harley: No. It turns out he knew it was me. He started laughing at me. And then things got ugly.",
        "Gus: How? Coop, your hands.",
        "Frank: Alan, I am sorry for your loss.",
        "Alan: I don't want to hear that you're sorry. I want you to do your job and arrest Olivia and ask her where she was prior to 9:00 tonight.",
        "Frank: Okay, you know what? There're not going to be any wild accusations here. I promise you I will get to the bottom of this.",
        "Olivia: No, no, I will tell you where I was.",
        "Bill: Olivia, don't say anything.",
        "Olivia: No, I was going to meet with Phillip. We all had private meetings with Phillip set up for 9:00, right, gang? Rick, Beth, come on, speak up. He promised each of us that he would give us our child back, and ours alone, if we didn't tell each other about the meeting.",
        "Alan: Well, then everyone is guilty, but none more than you, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: Frank, you have to find my daughter. That has to be your top priority.",
        "Frank: I promise you I'll do whatever I can to bring those children back, but you need to sit tight. Beth, Lizzie, I'm truly sorry. Rick, I'm sorry, man.",
        "Rick: What do we tell these children? How does Harley explain to Zach that his father is gone?",
        "Frank: Rick, I don't even think Harley knows yet.",
        "Cop: Hey.",
        "Gus: What's... what have you got?",
        "Cop: Gus, you know I can't tell you that.",
        "Gus: Oh, come on. It's my brother we're talking about.",
        "Cop: All right, we found a slug in the wall, and it looks like a .38.",
        "Gus: Oh. Well, thank you. Appreciate it.",
        "Cop: Sure.",
        "Gus: Did you do this? Did you shoot him?",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Gus: Are you sure?",
        "Harley: No. I don't remember. Don't bother looking. There's no gun, there's no gun. I promise, I didn't bring one.",
        "Gus: Thank God.",
        "Harley: But Phillip did. It was a .38.",
        "Gus: You want to tell me how you know that Phillip has a gun, right down to the caliber, but you don't know if you shot him with it or not?",
        "Harley: I don't know. I'm doing the best I can, but it's hard to focus on anything beyond the fact that he... he took my kids, and he put them away like they were trophies.",
        "Gus: Just be quiet, okay? Just take a deep breath and just think. Where did you catch up with Phillip? Hm?",
        "Harley: Here.",
        "Gus: Was he alone?",
        "Harley: Yes. And so I started doing my Ruth thing, but he tore off my wig and he started yelling at me.",
        "Gus: Because he knew you were Ruth?",
        "Harley: Yes.",
        "Gus: Then what happened?",
        "Harley: He got in my face.",
        "Phillip: Did you think I wouldn't eventually figure it out, Harley? Did you think you could just fool me forever?",
        "Harley: Look, Phillip, listen. I just want Zach and Jude back. That's all.",
        "Phillip: I said 9:00! You're early! You just blew your last chance to get the boys back. I hope you took a lot of pictures of them because that's all you're going to have to remember them by.",
        "Harley: You are a sick animal!",
        "Phillip: I'm sick? I'm sick? Am I sick, Harley?",
        "Harley: You need help!",
        "Phillip: Am I sick, and do you care about me? Yeah, you care about me.",
        "Harley: Help!",
        "Phillip: You're just like all the other hypocrites in this town. You're so sanctimonious, you're so righteous. \"Oh, Phillip's sick, he's sick, he's turned into such a monster.\" Let me ask you something. Let me ask you, did you tell any of the other mothers that you were coming here?",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Phillip: No, no, I didn't think you did. And what about you? What about your charade, Ruth? If I remember correctly, you were the one that took Zach first.",
        "Harley: You're not going to get away with this. I'll make you pay. I will.",
        "Phillip: Really? You want to stop me? You want to stop me, Harley? Here you go. Here's your chance to stop me.",
        "Gus: Okay, so he put the gun on the table.",
        "Harley: Yes, right between us. And he said to me that he didn't...",
        "Gus: I know what he said, I know what he said. I want to know what he meant. He puts a loaded gun on the table. What was he trying to accomplish?",
        "Harley: I don't know. Your guess is as good as mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: I do hope that Cassie feels better. She didn't look too good. Speaking of which, neither do my nails. Have a very good evening.",
        "Jeffrey: Not so fast. There's something we have to discuss.",
        "Dinah: I filed everything you asked me to file, I swear.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm talking about what made Cassie faint in the first place: Your little bombshell about knowing Edmund before your official return to Springfield? That was sure news to me.",
        "Dinah: It slipped out, by accident.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, nothing's an accident with you, Dinah, especially when it comes to Cassie. You were working him from the start, weren't you? You were working Eddie boy, feeding him information about me so that he would perceive me as a threat.",
        "Dinah: Feeding him?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. You targeted Edmund because you knew you could use him and make trouble for Cassie.",
        "Dinah: You give me way too much credit, you know that? I had no idea what Edmund meant to her when I came back to town. I figured her real juice was for her dead Prince Richard's living double. It just made sense.",
        "Jeffrey: Then?",
        "Dinah: Still does.",
        "Jeffrey: I want to know everything you told Edmund when you first made contact.",
        "Dinah: (Laughs) My gosh. The world does revolve around you, doesn't it? Relax, Jeffrey. I have kept all your precious secrets.",
        "Jeffrey: Not all of them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doctor #2: I only did a quick examination, but no, stress didn't cause Ms. Winslow's lightheadedness. And she's in good shape physically, and she ate not too long ago.",
        "Edmund: All right, then why did she faint? Why did she faint? Cassie, What's going on?",
        "Cassie: I... I had a miscarriage.",
        "Edmund: What? But... Cassie, you were pregnant? I didn't know.",
        "Cassie: Neither did I.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, how could you have been pregnant? You weren't...",
        "Cassie: Able to conceive, yeah, I know.",
        "Doctor #2: My guess is she was two, maybe three weeks pregnant.",
        "Edmund: Oh, my god.",
        "Doctor #2: It's not all that unusual for a woman to think conception is no longer a possibility and then to become pregnant anyway.",
        "Cassie: I don't believe this.",
        "Doctor #2: I'll leave you two alone.",
        "Edmund: Thank you. Thank you, doctor.",
        "Doctor #2: Not at all.",
        "Cassie: This is unbelievable. I mean, I was pregnant. Oh! I mean, I'm not sad, and I am... I'm just confused, you know? And sorry.",
        "Edmund: Sorry? I hope you're not apologizing to me.",
        "Cassie: Edmund, this is just as much your loss as it is mine. I mean, I know that you weren't expecting a baby. I... are you okay?",
        "Edmund: No, Cassie. This is my fault.",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Edmund: This is my fault. If I hadn't kept that secret about Dinah, then...",
        "Cassie: No, no, no, stop that. You heard what the doctor said. I didn't have a miscarriage because of stress. I'm not looking to blame anyone, Edmund. All I can think about is what this means.",
        "Edmund: Which is?",
        "Cassie: My life has changed. Our life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Right after you showed up at Cassie's farm...",
        "Dinah: Hart's farm.",
        "Jeffrey: Whatever. Eddie boy decided that he wanted to confront me. You see, he thought I was in love with his little girlfriend, Cassie. Then he did a little digging and found out I took a leave of absence from the bureau so that I could be closer to Cassie.",
        "Dinah: He's a very smart man.",
        "Jeffrey: Or a clueless one who had help. You told him, didn't you? Hm? You told him that we were working together.",
        "Dinah: Yes. Yes, I did. I let it slip out to Edmund.",
        "Jeffrey: You let it slip out? Oh, it was just an accident, right, hmm? Like your little accident over there with Cassie?",
        "Dinah: You know what, Jeffrey? I am admitting it to you. You asked me, I admitted it to you. That should prove something to you.",
        "Jeffrey: What, that I'm right about you?",
        "Dinah: No. That I have no trouble playing it straight with you, about this or anything else.",
        "Jeffrey: I really wish I could believe that, Dinah. There is one thing that I am certain of, though, and that is that you love to stir the pot where Cassie is concerned. Well, let me tell you something, if you plan on using Eddie boy for the spoon, you're going to have your hands full because the man is dangerous.",
        "Dinah: Edmund has Cassie's love. I mean, shouldn't that utterly transform even the most dangerous man?",
        "Jeffrey: If you push this guy to the point where he thinks that you are the root of all of his problems, he is going to do everything that you can to make sure that your life is a living hell. And that little stay at the cell that I dragged you out of is going to seem like a weekend at the spa.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Cooper here. Yeah. What? Where? In the wall? Be right there.",
        "Lizzie: So, what do we do now?",
        "Beth: We take care of your father.",
        "Alan: And we help each other, and we stand strong and together as a family.",
        "Rick: I'm just going to miss him. You know, I was always amazed at Phillip. He had more life in him than two people put together.",
        "Alan: It's because he was a Spaulding.",
        "Rick: And my best friend, Alan, for a very long time.",
        "Alan: Yes, he was. Until recently, wasn't he, Rick?",
        "Rick: You know, Alan, I just wanted to tell you how sorry I am. That's all.",
        "Alan: Don't give me that mealy mouthed crap. You're not sorry at all, Rick.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: What have you got? You sure? Well, then do it and do it quickly. All right. So, about the gun.",
        "Harley: I still don't remember. What do you think?",
        "Gus: Truthfully? The fact that you were so mad at him and there was the presence of a loaded gun, there's blood on your hands after he was shot, it's not that good, baby.",
        "Harley: Yeah. That's what I think, too.",
        "Gus: My God. There's a huge cut in your head.",
        "Harley: I just remembered I fell.",
        "Gus: How?",
        "Harley: What are you doing?",
        "Phillip: Go ahead. Take it. You know how to use it, and I know you want to. Let's see just how much you hate me.",
        "Harley: I don't want to shoot you, Phillip. I just want the boys back. That's all. (Cocks gun)",
        "Phillip: Over my dead body. Let's see how tough you are, Harley. Come on. It's loaded.",
        "Harley: What are you doing? Why are you baiting me?",
        "Phillip: What's the matter? You afraid? Or maybe you don't love them as much as I do? Or are you just too good to do it, Harley? I know you're always saying the Cooper's are so much better than the Spaulding's.",
        "Harley: They are.",
        "Phillip: Really? That's not what I asked you. Are you--are you--in this moment, are you better than I am?",
        "Harley: Phillip.",
        "Phillip: Do you love them as much as I do?",
        "Harley: (Whimpering)",
        "Phillip: Do you want to stop me?",
        "Harley: I want to stop the insanity.",
        "Phillip: Stop me! Go ahead! Then you do it! Stop me!",
        "Harley: All right! All right, all right!",
        "Gus: So then what happened?",
        "Harley: Then we struggled. And we had the gun between us. We both were holding the gun. And that's when I fell, I think. I'm not positive.",
        "Gus: All right. So the blood that was on your hands, was that your blood or was it Phillip's blood?",
        "Harley: I don't know? I don't remember.",
        "Gus: Please, you've got to remember. You have got to remember.",
        "Harley: I don't remember. I don't remember.",
        "Gus: Did the gun go off, or not?",
        "Harley: I don't remember. Do you want me to make something up? Do you want me to lie? I don't remember. We have to tell Frank.",
        "Gus: No. That is the last thing that you're going to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Cassie, can't you just sit still? You heard what the doctor said.",
        "Cassie: You have no idea what it's like to have someone tell you that you can't have another child.",
        "Edmund: No. No, I don't, but I remember how devastated you were.",
        "Cassie: But those days are gone. Thank God. I mean, when... when you get news like that, I mean, first you just don't believe it, you know? You think that the doctor is crazy or that they've made some kind of mistake, so then you go see another doctor.",
        "Edmund: Who tells you the same thing.",
        "Cassie: And the no's start piling up. You get to a point where you're willing to go to a faith healer just as long as you can hear someone say yes. But no one ever says yes. You keep asking the same questions and you keep getting the same answers, and then you get to the point that you just give up and you finally let go of the idea that you're ever going to make a baby with the man that you love.",
        "Edmund: Well, you handled it well. But I suppose you didn't have much of a choice.",
        "Cassie: A day hasn't gone by when I haven't thought about what I had to give up, what I lost. But tonight I find out that I never really lost it. Edmund, it was just kind of out of reach for a while.",
        "Edmund: Life is strange.",
        "Cassie: And kind of sweet, you know? Surprisingly sweet. Kind of like you.",
        "Edmund: Me, Cassie?",
        "Cassie: Edmund, what happened tonight says as much about you as it does about me. And that news is good, very good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doctor: Ms. Winslow wanted me to tell you that she's going to be fine.",
        "Jeffrey: What was the problem?",
        "Doctor: Well, she actually asked me to tell you that, too. She had a miscarriage. It's not as serious as it sounds. She wasn't very far along. I'm just glad I could help.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, thank... thank you.",
        "Dinah: You're acting like it's yours. The baby.",
        "Jeffrey: If you try to use this, if you try to rub this in Cassie's face in any way, shape or form, I'm warning you, Dinah, Edmund will be the least of your problems.",
        "Dinah: The DA looks like the prince, and now he's acting like him. Relax, Jeffrey. I don't have any intention of gloating, especially after losing babies.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: All right, listen. We are going to find Emma, okay?",
        "Olivia: When? How? We have no idea where Phillip took her. I hate him, Bill. He was a horrible, heartless human being who loved nothing more than to torture me.",
        "Bill: Olivia, listen to me. Listen to me, okay? Phillip is dead. You're not going to do yourself or Emma any favors by going on about what he did to you.",
        "Olivia: You know, it's one thing for Alan to think that I murdered him, but I never thought that you would.",
        "Bill: What? Listen, I do not think that. I don't. But I do wish you'd told me that he wanted to meet you tonight.",
        "Olivia: What, because not telling you makes me seem more guilty than you already think that I am? Well, you know what? I'm not the only one who got a summons tonight, Bill. You were on your way to company. Did you tell me about it? No.",
        "Bill: Okay, so maybe I'm the one who killed him? Is that what you're talking about?",
        "Olivia: Look, considering how many people besides us hated Phillip, things are going to get ugly when the police start looking into this, so we have to make a choice. Either we stick together when the questioning starts, or not.",
        "Bill: Olivia.",
        "Olivia: No, really. Let's be real about this, okay? Because it's not like this is in sickness and health and \"death do us part.\" This marriage is in name only, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: You're right, Alan, I'm not sorry. I'm not sorry the best friend I ever had in my life was shot in the chest and died in the prime of his life. I'm not sorry at all. I'm glad it happened. You're an idiot!",
        "Alan: You deserted Phillip's friendship when he needed it the most.",
        "Rick: He took my son! Your son was my best friend. He was the most honorable, loyal human being I've ever met in my life, and what he gave me, Alan, I will never find again. And I wish I could tell you I did everything I could to help him, Alan, but I can't. I blew it. I'm sorry, Alan. I'm sorry he's gone. (Sobs)",
        "Alan: He was my son. I loved him, too, Rick.",
        "Rick: I'm shaking.",
        "Alan: Look, look, look...",
        "Rick: I'm supposed to perform the autopsy on him, and I'm shaking.",
        "Alan: Rick, you're in shock. We'll make a phone call, and we'll get another ME over here from another county, okay?",
        "Rick: Thanks, Alan. I appreciate that.",
        "Alan: Sure. I want you two to go home. The car is out front waiting for you.",
        "Lizzie: You're not coming with us?",
        "Alan: No, I have some details I need to take care of here, and...",
        "Beth: Okay. Okay, then I'll stay with you. Okay, well, you just tell me what needs to be done.",
        "Alan: Beth, Beth, I am telling you to take Elizabeth home now. This is what Phillip would want.",
        "Beth: Phillip was always protecting me and the children. What went wrong? (Sobbing)",
        "Alan: Don't... Beth, don't think... don't think about what went wrong. Just think about the good times.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Now, you're just going to keep quiet. You're not going to say anything, especially to Frank, until I just figure out... figure out what happened tonight. All right?",
        "Harley: But... but... but... if I... if I shot Phillip, I'm going to go to jail.",
        "Gus: A large \"if.\" They never found a gun, so it doesn't matter. And he's got a lot of enemies. He's not short of enemies.",
        "Harley: But he... he hated me more than anybody else. He... he bulldozed my house and he tried to destroy my father's business. He gave my father a heart attack. He stole my kids. I mean, with that kind of motive, I'm the prime suspect in this case, Gus.",
        "Gus: It doesn't matter. There's no gun. They never found a gun. It doesn't matter. You've just got to keep your mouth shut, okay, until I can figure this out. Okay?",
        "Harley: You would do that?",
        "Gus: What do you think?",
        "Frank: Harley? Harley. I've been looking all over for you. Oh, my God. Are you okay, Sis? Oh, my God. Did Gus tell you what happened?",
        "Harley: Mm-hmm. Phillip was shot.",
        "Frank: Yeah. There's more, Sis. He didn't make it. I'm sorry, Gus.",
        "Harley: Oh, my God. Oh, my...",
        "Gus: Damn it!",
        "Harley: Gus? Oh, no. Oh. Gus? Oh, no.",
        "Frank: The doctors did everything they could. Are you okay? Are you okay?",
        "Harley: Not really, no.",
        "Frank: Stupid question, right? Phillip's dead, the kids are gone. I just wish I could make this a whole lot easier for you.",
        "Harley: Frank?",
        "Frank: Yeah, honey?",
        "Harley: There's something I have to tell you.",
        "Frank: What?",
        "Harley: I love you.",
        "Frank: Aw, Sis, I love you, too, honey. I love you so much. Don't worry about Jude and Zach. I'll bring them home. I promise, I promise. (Cell phone ringing)",
        "Gus: So? You sure? Okay, I'm on my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Look, this is more than just some rubber-stamp marriage.",
        "Olivia: Is it?",
        "Bill: Yeah, it is. It's a partnership.",
        "Olivia: Oh.",
