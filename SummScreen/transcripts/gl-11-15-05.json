        "Lizzie thinking Coop doesn't want to be with her starts to leave the dance but is stopped by Quinn. Coop is told by his friend who helped get him the tickets that he needs to start washing dishes to pay for the help he got to get Lizzie to the dance, which is why he blew her off in the first place, embarrassed by his lack of money. Lizzie and Coop run into each other thinking the other has left and promise to tell each other the whole truth from now on. Buzz talks to Ava about opening his new place CO2, Sandy and Tammy's wedding, and Olivia. Later he goes to Towers to help Coop out. Jonathan tells Reva that he is her \"real\" son and if she loves him she will help him, she goes to Sandy and asks if he really thinks that he is making the right decision and offers him an \"escape route\". He refuses her help and Jonathan comes across this and thinks Reva is taking Sandy's side against him yet again. After Reva's talk about what Tammy needs, Jonathan puts money down on a house. Tammy asks Ava's help in picking out a wedding present for Sandy, which leads to her slipping that she knows him better than anyone thinks."

        "Lizzie: This has been the best night of my life and I know exactly how I want it to end.",
        "Coop: Really.",
        "Lizzie: With you, Coop. In a bed with your arms around me. Come on, let's go.",
        "Coop: Wow. I... Lizzie, are you sure?",
        "Lizzie: Yes, I'm sure. Are you kidding me? After my family problems and money problems, none of that matters. You're the only one who matters.",
        "Coop: Look, I feel the exact same way, but I can't. I can't do this tonight, okay? I promised my dad I would help him at the new place. You know, CO2.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, right.",
        "Coop: I can't bail on him and he wants to get the place up and running as quickly as possible.",
        "Lizzie: Really.",
        "Coop: Yeah, so... look, I want to, but I just... I can't right now.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, it's no problem. Really.",
        "Coop: Look, maybe I can get out of there early and we can meet up later. Does that sound okay? Look, please do not think that this is me blowing you off, okay? It's not that I don't want to be with you.",
        "Lizzie: It's fine, coop.",
        "Coop: Okay. Well, how about I walk you down stairs and put you in a cab home.",
        "Lizzie: No, you know what? Actually, I can get one myself. I'd better go. Call me if... you know, if you get the chance.",
        "Coop: Okay.",
        "Man: Hey.",
        "Coop: Hey.",
        "Man: Where's your girlfriend?",
        "Coop: She actually just went home. Thank you so much for making all this possible tonight. I really, really appreciate it.",
        "Man: Hey, one hand wash it is. Or in this case, you wash dishes like we agreed. You must really care about this girl to be doing this.",
        "Coop: You know what? I do.",
        "Ava: Here you go.",
        "Buzz: Oh, god, thanks.",
        "Ava: You're welcome.",
        "Buzz: Ava, right?",
        "Ava: That's me. What is this place?",
        "Buzz: This is my new franchise. This is co2.",
        "Ava: Carbon dioxide?",
        "Buzz: No, company two. It's light bites of the promenade. You know, milkshakes, fries, spanikopita.",
        "Ava: Spanikopita. I thought kids would like the name.",
        "Ava: They are everywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Who's next?",
        "Sandy: Oh, my goodness, I think that's it. We've passed out all the invitations.",
        "Tammy: You're kidding. All of them?",
        "Sandy: All we have to do now show up to the ceremony and get married.",
        "Tammy: Wow!",
        "Sandy: No turning back now.",
        "Tammy: Like I would want to. This is what I've been dreaming of my whole life, Sandy.",
        "Sandy: Well, let's make those dreams come true for the rest of your life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: If you love me as much as you claim to, you do this one thing for me, mom. Help me get Tammy away from Sandy.",
        "Reva: You know what you're asking?",
        "Jonathan: I'm asking you to stop that wedding before it starts.",
        "Reva: But Tammy...",
        "Jonathan: Doesn't love him. She belongs with me. Are you with me or against me? Mom, yes or no.",
        "Reva: Do you know how long I have waited for you to ask something of me? Something that would make up for all the years I missed with you?",
        "Jonathan: Then you'll do it? You just said that you...",
        "Reva: I know. I know what I said. And you know that I love you, right?",
        "Jonathan: If you love me, you'll help me be with Tammy.",
        "Reva: Jonathan, I can't. You're not just asking me to help you get the girl. What you're asking me to do is tear my family apart!",
        "Jonathan: You're going to fight me on this?",
        "Reva: I didn't say that.",
        "Jonathan: Forget it. I knew it.",
        "Reva: Please, just wait.",
        "Jonathan: For what? For you to tell me I don't know what I'm feeling? Or that Tammy doesn't.",
        "Reva: If you and Tammy get together, do you know what that will do to this family?",
        "Jonathan: I'm the family, Reva! Me.",
        "Reva: I know.",
        "Jonathan: No, the fact is I will never come first with you, never.",
        "Reva: Jonathan, I do love you. I do, and I don't want you to be hurt, either. But if you and Tammy get together, think about the obstacles you have to face.",
        "Jonathan: Other people's opinions. I don't care!",
        "Reva: Not just other people's opinions. Everything! Do you know how vulnerable Tammy is? She didn't have a father. She grew up in foster care. She lost Richard. You hurt her. She needs security in her life now and for the rest of her life. That's what she needs. Someone to love her. Someone to cherish her. Someone to put her up on a pedestal! She needs a house with a white picket fence, you know? This is what she needs right here. This is what she needs. Can you give this to Tammy?",
        "Jonathan: How do you know that this is what she needs?",
        "Reva: Because I've known her a lot longer than you have. Can you give her the security she needs, Jonathan? Where are you going to live, in the back of the bar? You can't stand on your own two feet. How are you going to prop Tammy up, too?",
        "Jonathan: This is really what you think of me?",
        "Reva: No. What I think is you're this amazing young man who's come an incredibly long way. But you're still not the person you could be yet. Tammy needs a person that she can depend on, Jonathan. Just, you know, let Tammy go and live the life that she has to lead, okay? You work on yourself! You deal with your own issues. I will help you with that.",
        "Jonathan: That's a good speech, Reva, but I can read between the lines. You just don't think I'm good enough for her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Most guys would leave all the planning to the bride, but you've shared everything with me.",
        "Sandy: Last time I checked, that's what a marriage is about.",
        "Tammy: Yes, it is. And that's why I know you will make an amazing husband, why I know I made the right choice.",
        "Sandy: And I made the right choice, too. You are going to be an amazing wife. Oh, speaking of wedding stuff, I have to go.",
        "Tammy: Where? Why?",
        "Sandy: There's a surprise I'm working on.",
        "Tammy: What? Tell me.",
        "Sandy: I will uh... let's just call it a wedding present. I'll meet you back here in about an hour, okay? Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Cute kids. You know them?",
        "Ava: Sort of. Are you going to the wedding?",
        "Buzz: Well, yeah. You going? I got the invitation right here.",
        "Ava: May I see it?",
        "Buzz: Yes, you may. Are you going?",
        "Ava: No, I'm not, but my boss is.",
        "Buzz: Jonathan?",
        "Ava: No, Olivia.",
        "Buzz: Olivia? Olivia's going to the wedding? I didn't think she'd be in the mood for weddings.",
        "Ava: That makes the two of us.",
        "Coop: Hey, pops, it's me.",
        "Buzz: You at the charity shindig with Lizzie?",
        "Coop: Well, I'm still here, but Lizzie left to go home.",
        "Buzz: You had a fight?",
        "Coop: There was no fight. Can you please promise me you won't get mad at me?",
        "Buzz: Go on.",
        "Coop: All right, look. I kind of came up a little short on cash as far as tickets for the dance. So a friend of mine who works over here at Towers did us a favor, but in order to repay that favor, I need to stay here tonight to wash dishes. As in, like, right now.",
        "Buzz: Coop...",
        "Coop: Look, I had to get Lizzie out of here as quick as possible so that she wouldn't see. I'm asking for you cover for me if you see her tonight. That's all.",
        "Buzz: You could tell her the truth, you know.",
        "Coop: Yeah, I probably could have. No, no, I couldn't have told her. Look, dad, I feel like a loser already enough, okay? I just need you to do this one favor for me, okay? I'll see you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Lizzie! I didn't know you were still here! Where's coop?",
        "Lizzie: He had to go and I'm leaving, too.",
        "Quinn: No, you're not. You're going to come back to my table and have some champagne. And you still owe me a dance, remember?",
        "Lizzie: Sure, I guess so.",
        "Man: Great. Well...",
        "Lizzie: Uh, one sec...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I'm not judging you.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, no? Ever since you found out that I was your real son, you've been looking for a way to fix things between us.",
        "Reva: Yes, of course I have.",
        "Jonathan: You've been looking for a way to fix the hell that my life became when you dumped me. I mean, that's what you just said.",
        "Reva: Yes, and I meant that.",
        "Jonathan: What am I asking you to do, Reva? Help me rob a bank? No. I'm... I'm asking you to help me get a girl that I care about more than I've ever cared about anyone or anything in my entire life. And what is your answer? This? This? You want me to buy a freaking station wagon and move to the burbs?",
        "Reva: No, no, Jonathan, I love you! I love you so much! I do. But this isn't just about you and me. This does affect the whole family. And whether you like it or not, it affects all of us. Because Tammy loves her mother, she cares what her mother thinks. Cassie just lost a child. This family has been through such turmoil these last couple of years.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You should know because you caused most of it.",
        "Reva: No! No! We should know! And now you want to put Tammy and Cassie through... and all of us, the rest of us through more pain and more confusion!",
        "Jonathan: Oh, well I'm sorry that my feelings mean so much to you, mom. I'm glad to know that I'm not a burden.",
        "Reva: That's not what I'm saying. I don't even know what I'm saying anymore. I'm not saying that I won't help you. I just... I need time to think, Jonathan. I just... I need time to think about... because what you're asking me to do could turn out hurting so many people!",
        "Jonathan: But, hey, it's cool if Tammy marries a guy that she doesn't really love.",
        "Reva: She does love him.",
        "Jonathan: No, she doesn't. She's only with him because he's not me, even though he pretended to be me. And, obviously, he did a good job because here you are defending him to me, your real son. Do you really know that much about Sandy Foster, Reva? Have you ever asked yourself that question?",
        "Reva: What do you mean?",
        "Jonathan: You think that he's going to make Tammy happy because he's got a cute smile and he promises her that he'll always be true. ( Scoffs )",
        "Reva: Please, Jonathan, just give me time. I want to help. I do.",
        "Jonathan: I'm your son, Reva. I'm your son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Did you have fun tonight?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I did.",
        "Quinn: Well, I didn't. That dude from the college kept talking my ear off all night. I don't know, he wants my dad to open up some chem lab at the college. Oh, you should seen what he was wearing. Why weren't you there to rip on him?",
        "Lizzie: ( Laughs )",
        "Quinn: Uh-huh. Well, the crowd seems to be thinning out just a bit. Do you have plans later, Lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: Well, I'm not sure yet, actually.",
        "Quinn: Well, I'm going to take that as a no and you should come back with me to my parents' house and we can soak up in the hot tub just a little bit.",
        "Lizzie: ( Laughs ) yeah, right. Coop!",
        "Coop: What are you doing here I thought...",
        "Lizzie: I thought you were going to help Buzz!",
        "Coop: I...",
        "Lizzie: You lied to me.",
        "Coop: No, well sort of.",
        "Lizzie: Why did you do that?",
        "Man: Make sure you bus tables eight and seven, too.",
        "Lizzie: You're working here?",
        "Coop: Lizzie, it was the only way to get us a table for tonight.",
        "Lizzie: Why didn't you tell me?",
        "Coop: Because I didn't want to put you through this hell and drama.",
        "Lizzie: I would have understood.",
        "Coop: I can see that now. But, look... I mean, are you cool with this?",
        "Lizzie: Yes, I'm cool with this. Look, I just thought you didn't want to be with me because, you know, you didn't want to be with me.",
        "Coop: No, Lizzie, how could you think that?",
        "Lizzie: I guess temporary insanity.",
        "Coop: Yeah, no kidding. Wait a minute, what are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to be leaving.",
        "Lizzie: Well....",
        "Quinn: Come on, girlie, let's go finish our dancing. Coop.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Oh, Reva, hi. Tammy's not here, but you can come in.",
        "Reva: You're here all by your lonesome, huh?",
        "Sandy: Yeah.",
        "Reva: What's that?",
        "Sandy: Can you keep a secret?",
        "Reva: Oh, god, not you, too. Oh, I'm sorry, honey, just go ahead. ( Laughs )",
        "Sandy: Actually, I'm surprising Tammy with a honeymoon in Hawaii.",
        "Reva: Wow!",
        "Sandy: We'll spend the first day or two at the Bauer cabin, but then aloha.",
        "Reva: Wow!",
        "Sandy: I don't know which hotel to book. I have three choices. Maybe you can help me out.",
        "Reva: Sure, I'd be glad to, but can we have a talk first?",
        "Sandy: Sure, about what?",
        "Reva: Well, it's just one of those talks that everybody should have before they tie the knot.",
        "Sandy: Reva, I know about the birds and the bees.",
        "Reva: Well, good, then we can just skip over all that and get right to the heavy stuff.",
        "Sandy: Which is?",
        "Reva: Sandy, are you sure you're making the right decision? Is this marriage what you really want?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: ( Sighs ) Ava, hi.",
        "Ava: Tammy, hi.",
        "Tammy: Do you have a minute? I need help with something.",
        "Ava: Sure, what's up?",
        "Tammy: I need to buy a wedding gift for sandy. I want it to be something unique but traditional.",
        "Ava: Sure.",
        "Tammy: Anyway, I'm at a total loss. How do you buy a present for your husband?",
        "Ava: I don't know. I don't... you know what? I don't even know Sandy that well so I don't know if I'm the right person.",
        "Tammy: I know. I know. But Olivia says that you have great taste, and she never says that about anybody, so I don't know, maybe you have some ideas? Or not. I mean... I'm sorry, never mind. I shouldn't have bothered you.",
        "Ava: No, no. Please don't go. It's not that. It's just that I don't even know where to begin.",
        "Tammy: You're not into this, are you? The marriage. You think Sandy and I are too young?",
        "Ava: Well, maybe. I just... I just don't see what the rush is.",
        "Tammy: We love each other. Why wait?",
        "Ava: Why not?",
        "Tammy: Because we both know that this is what's right for us.",
        "Ava: Then that's great. Really.",
        "Tammy: So you'll help me find a wedding gift for Sandy.",
        "Ava: Yeah.",
        "Jonathan: The guy's getting you as his wife. No gift could ever top that.",
        "Jonathan: Sorry for interrupting; I was just passing through.",
        "Ava: Not a problem.",
        "Jonathan: So looking for someone to help you pick out a gift for Sandy? How about me?",
        "Tammy: I think I'll stick with Ava.",
        "Jonathan: What do you get for the guy who already has everything? Any ideas?",
        "Tammy: Not yet, but I want it to be something special.",
        "Jonathan: Sure. You pass out all the wedding invitations?",
        "Tammy: Yup. All of them.",
        "Jonathan: So I guess this thing is really going to happen, huh?",
        "Tammy: It was always going to happen, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Any second thoughts?",
        "Ava: I asked her the same thing and she said...",
        "Tammy: Not a one.",
        "Jonathan: Well, good. This is the person that you're going to spend the rest of your life with.",
        "Tammy: I can't wait. Because I know that he can give me everything I've always dreamed of.",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) yeah. Safety, the security, the house with the white picket fence.",
        "Tammy: And love. Most of all love.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, yeah. Yeah, obviously you want to be in love with the guy. And you are. So I'm happy for you. Take care.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: The first time I got married, to Billy, I did it for all the wrong reasons. I think I even knew it back then, but I just didn't care because I was so young. Anyway, a couple of nights before the wedding, Billy and Josh's daddy showed up on my doorstep.",
        "Sandy: H.B.",
        "Reva: H.B. That's right. He said he was up there to uphold a Lewis family tradition. Something they referred to as an escape route. Anyway, the story behind that is that a senior member of that family pays a visit, separately, to the bride and groom a couple of nights before the wedding, you know, to give them a last chance.",
        "Sandy: To back out?",
        "Reva: It doesn't matter how many people have been invited to the wedding. It doesn't matter how many gifts you've already received that have to be returned. It doesn't matter how awkward it is or how embarrassing it is. If you have doubts, you can get out of this. I will help you get out of it. No pressure, no questions asked. It's just... that's what H.B. Said to me.",
        "Sandy: And you didn't have any doubts at all.",
        "Reva: Oh, no, I did. Because I was in love with Joshua. But I was so stubborn that i just went ahead with the wedding plans as they were and we all know how that turned out.",
        "Sandy: So now you are here to offer me the escape route.",
        "Reva: Yeah! Because now I am the elder. So?",
        "Sandy: So I am glad that you broached this subject, Reva.",
        "Reva: Yeah?",
        "Sandy: Yeah. Because now that you've offered me the escape route, I can tell you thanks, but no thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Look, I'd like to think that you were just trying to make me jealous, but you didn't even know I was here.",
        "Lizzie: I was on my way out and I started to cry so I was on my way into the bathroom...",
        "Coop: You were crying?",
        "Lizzie: I thought you didn't want to be with me, remember?",
        "Coop: Lizzie...",
        "Lizzie: I went to the bathroom, I came out, there was Quinn. He asked me to dance. So I figured he's being nice, it's making me feel better. Maybe I'll go in, maybe dance with him, I'm not sure. That's as far as it went Coop or would have gone. You know what? I don't care if you believe me or not. That's true.",
        "Coop: Look I... I just can't believe that you were crying because of me. I did not mean to hurt you and if I did, I apologize. All right? Look, I am so sorry about that.",
        "Lizzie: I didn't mean to hurt you, either. Evidently I did. So I'm sorry.",
        "Coop: We just need to be straight with each other from now on. All right, we need to be honest and tell the truth no matter how embarrassing or stupid or trivial it might be. Please, is that a deal?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, deal. Hey, you want me to help you with the dishes?",
        "Coop: No I don't want you to ruin your dress.",
        "Lizzie: I don't care about the dress.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, it cost you a fortune.",
        "Lizzie: I don't care about money, not anymore. All I care about is this, us.",
        "Coop: Me, too, all right? But I've got to get in the kitchen. Look, if I don't get these dishes done that means I can't get home to you sooner. Look, are you going to be okay getting home? Please tell me you're not getting a ride from Quinn.",
        "Lizzie: I'll take a cab, okay? I'll see you at home?",
        "Coop: Yes, you will.",
        "Coop: Come here. Okay, cool. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Lizzie: Hello? Um... just... hang on one second. Hello? Dean? Yeah, I know. I know, okay? Tomorrow? Okay, you don't have to threaten me, all right? I'll get you the money, I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Maybe there's something in here for Sandy.",
        "Ava: Was it just my imagination, or were things a little tense between you and Jonathan just now?",
        "Tammy: Things are always tense between me and Jonathan.",
        "Ava: Yeah, I noticed that. Why is that?",
        "Tammy: When did you notice?",
        "Ava: At the engagement party that Jonathan threw for you and Sandy. Every time you guys are in a room together. I'm a little curious about that because you guys are cousins, right?",
        "Tammy: Half cousins, actually. And we just met each other last year, but... it's complicated.",
        "Ava: He really cares about you, Jonathan.",
        "Tammy: Did he say something to you?",
        "Ava: No, no. It's just that I see the way that he looks at you and you look at him. And, I mean, really the way he went out of his way to throw such a nice party for you. You're really special to him, Tammy. Did I say something wrong?",
        "Tammy: No. I... the littlest things make me crazy lately. It's just nerves over the wedding and the planning.",
        "Ava: Nerves? But you're not nervous about the actual wedding, are you? I mean, you don't have any doubts about that.",
        "Tammy: Doubts? No, no doubts. Sandy is a wonderful, wonderful guy. I love him and I'm lucky to have him in my life.",
        "Ava: Yeah, he is. Sandy's a wonderful guy. And Jonathan's a good guy, too. He is! He just puts up this hard exterior wall and, you know, when you see the other side of him, which not too many people do, it's really hard not to like him. What?",
        "Tammy: I didn't know you cared so much about Jonathan.",
        "Ava: I do. But it's just not like that.",
        "Tammy: Well, hey, if you did, I mean...",
        "Ava: I don't.",
        "Tammy: Okay. Well, I'm just saying if you did, it would be nice. I mean, you're nice. You'd be good for Jonathan and I want him to be happy, too.",
        "Ava: He's my friend. He's my boss. That's it.",
        "Tammy: Well, anyway, I'm just saying Jonathan needs someone. Someone who's available so, you know, if you guys did hook up, I'm all for it.",

        "Blake: I am so glad that you like this house.",
        "Woman: We really. Do.",
        "Blake: It's a perfect starter house for a young couple like you. Would you like to make an offer?",
        "Man: We need to discuss it first.",
        "Blake: Well, of course. I understand. But in my opinion if you are really interested in this, you should move on this today. It just went on the market, it's in perfect condition. It's going to go. So feel free to discuss this in private and I'll be right here. I have a few phone calls to make.",
        "Woman: That's great. Thank you.",
        "Blake: Great.",
        "Jonathan: Seems like a nice house.",
        "Blake: Jonathan, how are you?",
        "Jonathan: Hi, Blake. Can I see this?",
        "Blake: I don't think it's exactly your style.",
        "Jonathan: I want it.",
        "Blake: Excuse me?",
        "Jonathan: You heard me, Blake. I'm going to buy this house.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: I love Tammy. I'm head over heels in love with the girl. When I talk about her, see, it sounds like I'm in a '40s movie because she... she's the most beautiful, amazing, kind person I've ever met. And I want to spend the rest of my life making her happy. Do you get the idea, or should I keep going on?",
        "Reva: No, no, I get it. I was pretty sure that was the answer you were going to give me anyway.",
        "Sandy: Then why'd you even ask?",
        "Reva: I don't know. Tradition. So are you going to have any family members at the wedding?",
        "Sandy: No. You know I don't have any family.",
        "Reva: Well I'm talking, you know, cousins, distance, twice removed.",
        "Sandy: There's no one.",
        "Reva: Okay. Well I just find that really sad.",
        "Sandy: Well, have you had this little talk with Tammy? Asked her about the escape route?",
        "Reva: No, not yet. But I'm pretty sure when I do, she's going to give me the same answer.",
        "Sandy: Yeah, I could have told you that.",
        "Reva: But if you have any doubts, either one of you, there's nothing wrong with postponement. Not canceling, just waiting.",
        "Sandy: Well, look, Reva, here's the deal, okay? A couple months ago I almost died and I woke up in the hospital looking up at Tammy and I realized that god had given me another chance in life. And I wanted to spend it with the girl I love. Not waste it waiting. So to answer your question once and for all, no. There is nothing that is going to keep Tammy and me from getting married. Nothing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: You want to buy this house? Really?",
        "Jonathan: Really.",
        "Blake: Well, how do you plan on paying for it? I happen to know that you blew through your trust fund.",
        "Jonathan: Well I happen to have money from my other dad, you know, the adoptive one who beat the crap out of me? Yeah, when he died he left me his bar and some money and I'm going to buy this house.",
        "Blake: No, you're not.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I am.",
        "Blake: No, you're not. Because that nice couple over there, the Bakers, they have first dibs on the house and I happen to know that they're going to put an offer in.",
        "Jonathan: Well, however much they offer, I'll pay you more.",
        "Blake: Jonathan, it doesn't work that way, okay? ( Cell phone rings ) they're first in line. Excuse me. Hello? Hello? Hold on. I can't hear you.",
        "Jonathan: Mrs. Baker, Mr. Baker, can we have a chat? Great. Come on, I need you. You and your wife are going to find a different house because this one, it's not right for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Tammy, for the last time, we're just friends! We don't think of each other that way. It's... ooh. And if he has hots for anyone, I'd say he has hots for...",
        "Tammy: What, go on?",
        "Ava: ( Sighs ) okay. Maybe I'm totally out of line by saying this, but if he has the hots for anyone, I would say he has the hots for you.",
        "Tammy: Oh, no, I... look, I'm going to be honest with you, okay? Jonathan and I did sort of have something when he first came to town. An attraction.",
        "Ava: And it's still there.",
        "Tammy: On his part.",
        "Ava: Okay.",
        "Tammy: I don't have feelings for him, anymore. I don't.",
        "Ava: Okay.",
        "Tammy: And I really want him to move on. Like I have with Sandy.",
        "Ava: Sometimes moving on is harder than you think.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: Good, Mr. and Mrs....",
        "Man: We don't want the house.",
        "Blake: Mr. And Mrs. Baker, wait a minute! Where are you going? What... oh, my god, what happened, Jonathan? What did you say to those people?",
        "Jonathan: How much is the bid on this thing again? Oh, yeah. Cool. Just bid that.",
        "Blake: You do not want to buy this house.",
        "Jonathan: Why not?",
        "Blake: We're not going to have this conversation.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, they already inspected for termites because that will save me some cash. This closing date, are they flexible? I might want to move in sooner.",
        "Blake: Okay, would you just stop it, please. This is not funny. You just cost me the sale of this house.",
        "Jonathan: I just gave you the sale. I told you that...",
        "Blake: Right. You're going to buy the house.",
        "Jonathan: Why is it so hard for you to understand that I want a house like this?",
        "Blake: Jonathan, stop playing games with me.",
        "Jonathan: I'm not playing games with you, just put in the bid.",
        "Blake: No!",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, and I'm telling you I'm going to pay you the money! Yes, I know there's interest on a loan. And I will give you it, okay? I've got to go.",
        "Quinn: Hey, aren't you cold out here? Listen, sorry, I... I was just joking around with your friend before. I didn't mean to insult him.",
        "Lizzie: He's not my friend. He's actually my boyfriend.",
        "Quinn: Does he make you happy Lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: Yes, I told you that when you asked me last time.",
        "Quinn: Well, I know what you said. It's just you and Coop come from such different worlds and on top of that, your family just cut you off. I mean, can a guy like Coop really give you what you need.",
        "Lizzie: Why does it all have to be about money?",
        "Quinn: It's only about money when you don't have any. Listen, now you do.",

        "Coop: You are just being a dad.",
        "Buzz: I could leave.",
        "Coop: It's the too late for that. You are in this with me.",

        "Quinn: You can use it to bid on the silent auction inside or for something else. Whatever you need, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: How much did you hear?",
        "Quinn: Enough to know that you have a bit of a situation that and you probably haven't told boyfriend about it. That sucks. Take it. No strings, okay?",
        "Lizzie: Look, I really need to take care of this myself, but thank you so much, Quinn. I really do appreciate it.",
        "Quinn: No, keep it. I'll call you, okay?",

        "Tammy: Ooh, I have to look in this place. This is so Sandy.",
        "Ava: You're right, it is.",
        "Tammy: Look at the vintage audio equipment. This must be where Reva got him this old radio.",
        "Ava: Look at the silver box.",
        "Tammy: Or the diamond cuff links.",
        "Ava: Ooh, I love that.",
        "Tammy: They're beautiful. I could get him those cufflinks.",
        "Ava: Wait, no, that's it. Perfect. Antique watch. Give him the antique watch, put it in the silver box and he can store his entire collection in it!",
        "Tammy: That is perfect.",
        "Ava: Yeah.",
        "Tammy: But Sandy doesn't wear any of his antique watches anymore. How did you know that he collects them?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I guess I overstepped.",
        "Sandy: No, no, I'm sorry. I guess I overreacted. It's just that all of a sudden it feels like you're questioning Tammy and me getting married when I thought you were our biggest champion.",
        "Reva: I am. I love you. You know that.",
        "Sandy: Well, great. Then can we wrap this up so I can go see my fianc\u00e9e?",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) absolutely.",
        "Sandy: I'm really glad we had this little talk.",
        "Reva: Sure you are.",
        "Sandy: No, really. I am. I want you to understand how much I love Tammy. I can't imagine my life without her.",
        "Reva: Well, you won't have to. Marry the girl. Make her happy. You two are good for each other.",
        "Sandy: I will. In fact, I'm going to go see her right now. I'll take the steps. I'll see you soon.",

        "Reva: It's not what it looked like.",
        "Jonathan: I offered you the chance to do the right thing. You don't want to do it, that's fine. But I'll be with Tammy without your help. If someone gets in the way, someone is going to get hurt.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Buzz: I don't have a love life.",
        "Coop: Pops, I think it's time that we found you a girl.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy and I are going to be together. That's nothing that you or anyone else can do about it.",
        "Tammy: Something I don't understand. Maybe you can explain.",
        "Tammy: Explain what?",
        "Tammy: How Ava knows so much about you."
