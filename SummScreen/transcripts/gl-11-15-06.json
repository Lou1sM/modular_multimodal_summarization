        "Fortune teller: Every month has it's moons. January brings the wolf moon. September, the harvest moon. And November, the frost moon, among the brightest of the winter skies. They call it the Frost Moon Festival. The town Springfield was founded by trailblazers who followed the frost moon, hoping it would lead them out of the wilderness in to a safe place they could call home. Hundreds of years later, it is still believed the frost moon lights a path to guide those who have lost their way.",
        "Dinah: Oh, oh!",
        "Fortune teller: I see great love in your future, my dear.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, that was the past.",
        "Fortune teller: Miss, you are mistaken.",
        "Dinah: Let me tell you something, lady, I grew up in all of this. The sword swallower, that's fake. And the three-faced man, that's fake. And especially you-- you, you're something else. You sell false hopes to fools, that's what you do.",

        "(Knock on the door)",
        "Vanessa: Dinah, wh...",
        "Dinah: I was half way down to the train station; I realized I needed something. This is what I need. I need one of these. Okay. I'm going to take this, all right? This belonged to dad when he was younger.",
        "Vanessa: Honey, what is it? What's going on?",
        "Dinah: I need to go downtown for a little while. Don't worry. Okay, I'll be fine. I'll give you a call when I get back.",
        "Vanessa: Stop right there. Okay, talk to me.",
        "Dinah: He set me up, Mom. He set me up. He thought that I poisoned Blake. It turns out that the poison was meant for Jeffrey. So he thought that I poisoned Jeffrey.",
        "Vanessa: \"He\" being Mallet?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. And, actually, it gets better. He pretended to want to protect me, and then he actually tried to trick me into going to the police station. So really, he used it all against me, you know. That was our biggest problem, Mom, if you remember. It was trust, and he used that against me. So that's almost like a gun, if you ask me.",
        "Vanessa: Yeah, or poison.",
        "Dinah: Can you believe that he thought that of me? You think that, too? You think that, too, of me, don't you, Mom?",
        "Vanessa: No, no, no, I don't. I'm just thinking that possibly Detective Mallet might have been trying to...",
        "Dinah: Is he here?",
        "Vanessa: No.",
        "Dinah: Is he here?",
        "Vanessa: No, no, Dinah. He's not here. I haven't talked to him. I was just trying to say that possibly he was trying to protect you.",
        "Dinah: What are you talking about, Mom? I thought that you of all would believe in me. I have a turned my life around. What do I have to do to catch a break in this town?",
        "Vanessa: I do believe in you, Dinah. I do. I just know that running is not the answer.",
        "Dinah: Well, it worked for me when I killed Hart, so...",
        "Vanessa: Yeah, but you haven't done anything wrong this time.",
        "Dinah: It doesn't matter, Mom. Because when I do the right thing, no one believes me.",
        "Vanessa: Oh, Dinah...",
        "Dinah: I can't get anybody in this town to love me without doubting me.",
        "Clarissa: Are you leaving me, too?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Man. She's probably already skipped town you know.",
        "Marina: Bad move. Look, I'm not entirely convinced that she did not poison that champagne, but I know you are.",
        "Mallet: But before I could tell her, she ran out of here, okay. And, now, she's out there thinking I set her up.",
        "Mia: Hey! How's our star? You look good. You doing something different with your hair?",
        "Mallet: No, nothing.",
        "Marina: (Laughing)",
        "Mallet: Mia, not a good time. Not now.",
        "Mia: Not now. Why not now? I told you we were shooting today. The station's got a new owner and...",
        "Mallet: Well, can't they do a rerun, put on a rerun or something?",
        "Mia: No. The audience wants to see more of you.",
        "Marina: Your audience wants more of you. Go figure.",
        "Mia: So, what's on the docket for today, Detective?",
        "Mallet: My new partner's going to fill you in. Detective Marina Cooper, whiz kid, next big thing.",
        "Marina: Uh... Mallet? No, Mallet. Hi.",
        "Mia: You're a very attractive young woman.",
        "Marina: Who, me? No. (Laughs) Go on.",
        "Mia: So, what's your relationship like with Detective Mallet? Policemen, policemen we're putting away bad guys...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clarissa: Everyone's leaving. Mom's in the hospital and daddy's gone.",
        "Dinah: Sweetie, I would not leave you if you needed me.",
        "Vanessa: Honey, I think Matt got you that game that--",
        "Clarissa: Grownup talk? Okay, but I'm coming back. Dinah, don't go anywhere.",
        "Dinah: I didn't know she was here.",
        "Vanessa: Yeah, she's going to be staying with us while Blake is in the hospital.",
        "Dinah: So I assume she knows everything?",
        "Vanessa: She does not know about the internet business, but she's starting to hear things.",
        "Dinah: She doesn't need to be growing up this quickly, Mom. Parents are supposed to be there to protect her.",
        "Vanessa: There is a social service hearing today for her.",
        "Dinah: Are you telling me she may have to live somewhere else?",
        "Vanessa: The D.A. has gotten involved.",
        "Dinah: Who, Doris Wolfe? Doris Wolfe is a publicity whore and she's going to use Clarissa.",
        "Vanessa: Look, would you stay with her just for a minute? Please, Dinah?",
        "Dinah: Mom...",
        "Vanessa: Look, I've got to go get her homework at school before the hearing happens, all right? I'll be right back, I promise.",
        "Dinah: Mom, I am leaving when you get back!",
        "Clarissa: I got you one, too.",
        "Dinah: Thanks, munchkin.",
        "Clarissa: Can you not call me that anymore? I'm a little old for it.",
        "Dinah: You're right. Yes, you are right. You know what? What do you say we go ahead and do something fun, just us girls?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Oh, Blakey, I know. I know. Got a little scare there for a second, didn't you? You got scared because you know I had a damn good reason to get some revenge on you for the way that you played with my life the way you did. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm not going to hurt you because daddy wouldn't want me to do that. He would want me to try to help you. And I'm not even sure if I can do that. But I won't hurt you because of him and because of your children. But... I do know what it's like to be lost and angry and want to hurt people because someone hurt you. I guess that's how you felt when daddy died. You felt lost. In fact, you lost it when you lost him, didn't you? Really, I can't say that I blame you. Because I don't think any of us have felt really safe without him. But, Blake, honey, you have kids to think about. And what I don't understand is why you did something like this. They deserve to feel safe with you. And you didn't do that. You don't leave children by the side of the road and expect them to find their way home. You don't do that. You protect them, no matter what you're going through, you protect them. Well, I think I figured something out. I think I have my father in me somewhere deep down inside of me. And I'm going to tell you something: I don't want to end up like this. I don't want to end up like you. And I will do whatever it takes to make sure that doesn't happen. I hope that you get well. Quickly. You take care.",

        "Vanessa: Oh. Hi, Detective Mallet.",
        "Mallet: Hi, Mrs. Reardon. I'm having a hard time tracking Dinah down. Is she here?",
        "Vanessa: She's sleeping.",
        "Mallet: Oh great. Well, I'd love to wait if you don't mind.",
        "Vanessa: That's fine.",
        "Mallet: So how's life back in Springfield?",
        "Vanessa: Oh, it's just fine. I'm your new boss. You know that, right?",
        "Mallet: Huh? You're the Police Commissioner?",
        "Vanessa: (Laughs) No. No, I bought the TV station. I hear your new show's a great hit.",
        "Mallet: Oh, yeah. How soon do you think before Dinah wakes up?",
        "Vanessa: Well, I suspect that'll depend on why you're here.",
        "Mallet: She told you what happened?",
        "Vanessa: Well, she told me her version of the story.",
        "Mallet: I didn't set her up. I believed her when she told me she didn't poison Blake or Jeffrey. And before I could tell her, she took off. I've been trying to call her, but she's not picking up her phone. You know how she gets. I need to find her and tell her what happened before she goes off. Did she... did she do something?",
        "Vanessa: Yeah. I left her here for just a minute with Clarissa, Blake's daughter, and they're both gone.",
        "Mallet: Gone? Gone where?",
        "Vanessa: I don't know. When Dinah came here, she had her suitcase with her, and that's gone, and Clarissa's things are gone.",
        "Mallet: Why would she leave with Clarissa?",
        "Vanessa: Because the D.A. and social services have scheduled a hearing today for Clarissa. And I think Dinah thought--",
        "Mallet: Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Okay. Let's just sit right here. All right.",
        "Clarissa: What are you looking for?",
        "Dinah: These. We're going to Florida. We're going to go shopping. We're going to go swimming with the dolphins and have a good time. What?",
        "Clarissa: It's my mom. People are saying bad things about her, and if we go, she'll be all alone. Mallet's here.",
        "Mallet: Hey, Clarissa, sweetheart. How are you? Good to see you. I need to talk to you.",
        "Dinah: I'm busy. All right. Um, Clarissa, why don't you go in and ask for some French fries to go, okay?",
        "Mallet: Here you go, sweetheart.",
        "Dinah: What do you want?",
        "Mallet: Have you lost your mind?",
        "Dinah: That's nice. You track me down to ask me that? That's nice.",
        "Mallet: You went off with Clarissa when you know the D.A.'s looking for her?",
        "Dinah: She's my little sister. I'm not trying to kidnap her.",
        "Mallet: Really? You've got a kid, you've got luggage, you've got plane tickets...",
        "Dinah: Unbelievable. No, no. I would never do anything like that. Not that you would believe me. Here, you know what? Let me just make this easier.",
        "Mallet: What are you doing?",
        "Dinah: Is this what you wanted to do?",
        "Mallet: Oh, come on.",
        "Dinah: You brought them?",
        "Mallet: Who?",
        "Mia: We're back on the scene with Detective Mallet of the Springfield P.D. and it looks like we've got ourselves a fugitive situation with a twist.",
        "Mallet: Uh... come on. (Sighs)",
        "Dinah: How could you do this?",
        "Mallet: I didn't. They're supposed to be shooting another episode. They're supposed to be with Marina.",
        "Dinah: Marina?",
        "Mallet: (Whispers) Let's just get this off. Come on, guys, this isn't police business.",
        "Mia: Neither was your on-air proposal. You should have seen the ratings.",
        "Mallet: I mean, with all due respect, you can take the ratings and shove them up your--",
        "Mia: We're still rolling. The whole country will see this.",
        "Mallet: Oh, they will? Right, right. Honey, the whole country's going to see this.",
        "Dinah: Mallet, Mallet...",
        "Mallet: No, it's all right. Then you might want to look at these. Yes, \"The Law\" wants to take you on vacation to Orlando, Florida. It's part of our first ever sweepstakes here at \"The Law,\" all sponsored by Spaulding Enterprises. Yes, this all-inclusive vacation can be yours. Just call the number at the bottom of the screen...",
        "Mia: We don't do this.",
        "Mallet: Oh, you're right, we don't do this. You have to be the 100th caller to get through to our producer, Mia. If it's busy keep trying. Mia, what's your home phone number? What's your home phone number, Mia?",
        "Mia: Don't quit your day job, Detective. Let's take five. Policemen, policemen we're putting away bad guys policemen, policemen we're making it safe for you policemen, policemen we're putting away bad guys.",
        "Dinah: All right, baby, you got all your stuff?",
        "Mallet: Hey, hey, hey. You can't go anywhere.",
        "Dinah: Oh, I can go somewhere you're not. (Cell phone rings)",
        "Mallet: Detective Mallet. Right. Hold on. That's the D.A., she's at your mom's.",
        "Dinah: Mallet, please, you've got to do something, please. Please.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, hi, I'm back. How you doing, Ms. Wolfe? Uh-huh. Actually, I have Clarissa Marler with me. Well, I can't get her to the court any time soon. Chief's orders. Yeah, the Chief of Police. Well, she's a witness in her mom's case, and we need her for a while for questioning. Yeah. But I think at this moment, that our case trumps yours. Well, do you eat with that mouth? Oh, well, good luck. Good luck with trying that.",
        "Dinah: Thank you, honey, thank you. Thank you, thank you. Again with you people?",
        "Mia: So what's next? What's the new witness, Detective Mallet?",
        "Mallet: Come on. Hey, don't do that.",
        "Dinah: Hey, hey, hey, hey.",
        "Mia: So what's the protocol when you're dealing with a minor?",
        "Mallet: When dealing with a witness like this, she's a special witness, so she needs special handling. No interrogation rooms, nothing like that. We work at first to gain her trust, take her some place she feels comfortable, some place that she feels safe.",
        "Clarissa: Can we go to the carnival?",
        "Dinah: Honey, I want you to wait over there, okay, for me. Just sit right there, okay? She is just a kid. I want you to shut that camera down right now. You got your answer, you hear me?",
        "Clarissa: The Frost Moon Festival's today. It's closer to my mom than Florida. Please?",
        "Mallet: Hey, sweetie. How about you guys go somewhere else because your big sis isn't fond of carnivals.",
        "Dinah: No. It's okay. Let's do it. Let's do it.",
        "Mallet: I kind of have to go with you, you know. I just convinced the people from \"The Law\" that I'm trying to engage a witness.",
        "Dinah: Don't use the word engage around me, okay?",
        "Mallet: You don't even like those things, carnivals?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I had a bad childhood, okay? But you know what, sometimes you have to stick around and just suck it up.",
        "Mallet: I just covered for you.",
        "Dinah: Let's just go.",
        "Mallet: I got it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mia: This isn't a crime scene. All right, let's shoot some b- roll and hope for a drive by.",
        "Clarissa: Can we play the game where we knock down the bottles?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, sure, that's fine.",
        "Mallet: Let me get the tickets. You okay?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I'm fine.",
        "Clarissa: Ooh, I want cotton candy first.",
        "Dinah: You just had fries.",
        "Clarissa: Please.",
        "Dinah: All right, all right, all right. Go right over there. Stand where I can see you, okay? Careful.",
        "Mallet: You're not okay.",
        "Dinah: You told some lies today.",
        "Mallet: Yes, to help you.",
        "Dinah: As opposed to the lies you told to hurt me.",
        "Mallet: Can we talk about what happened at the station earlier, because I know that you think it was some kind of elaborate setup.",
        "Dinah: And you think that, plus this, is going to make my head spin. I never really spent a lot of time on this side. Fake, fake, fake, especially fake. It's like one big empty promise of something magical. If people only knew what went on behind-the-scenes.",
        "Mallet: I don't think you want to be here, I don't think you want to be around me. That's fine, that's cool. Clarissa is obviously having a great time. Why don't I stay and why don't you go.",
        "Dinah: How do you know that I won't take the next ticket out of town, huh?",
        "Mallet: Oh, I don't.",
        "Dinah: You know what happens when you don't have anywhere to call home? After a while, you stop, looking.",
        "Mallet: I don't believe that.",
        "Dinah: Well... you do. You do. You think that you're settled, but, see, you're not settled. And you lie and you cheat and you do whatever it takes, because it doesn't matter who you piss off because you're moving to the next town in a few days.",
        "Mallet: Who are we talking about?",
        "Dinah: Carneys.",
        "Mallet: Wow. Talk about putting on a big show... I mean, carnival.",
        "Dinah: See that lady over there?",
        "Mallet: Oh, fortune-tellers, I like them.",
        "Dinah: Yeah. She's a scam artist, and you probably should arrest her. What the hell is this? It wasn't enough for you to look at my palms. Now you're going to read my mind.",
        "Fortune teller: Remember, I see great love in store for you.",
        "Dinah: I think what you see is a tall man standing next to me without a wedding ring on his finger, so you being the rocket scientist you are, are going to try to make me believe that that's what I want to hear. I hate this. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barker: Hey! We have a winner. Step right up, little lady, and claim your prize. Or, risk what you have and try for something bigger.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, yeah, we're on a roll. We'll do it. Let's do it.",
        "Dinah: Come on, no, no, these games are rigged. We're not doing this.",
        "Mallet: What? You just won. Give me a shot.",
        "Dinah: No, it's ridiculous, it's rigged, and it's not going to work.",
        "Mallet: It's a game of chance. Take a chance. Let me try. Would you let go. Let go.",
        "Dinah: You let go of the ring. (Screams)",
        "Mallet: Come on. I am sick of this back and forth, you know that. We fight, we make up, we fight, we make up, that's what we do.",
        "Dinah: You know what? You arrested me.",
        "Mallet: You shoved O'Neill in my face.",
        "Dinah: You shamed me on television.",
        "Mallet: You constantly-- we're doing it. We're doing it again.",
        "Dinah: If you're so sick of it, then why don't you just let me go.",
        "Mallet: I'm sick of missing you.",
        "Dinah: You know what? Then leave! Then leave! I will call the cops.",
        "Mallet: You always say that. You forget, I am a cop.",
        "Dinah: You know what, Mallet? I want this to be over, with you and me, I just want this to be over. I know that you love me, and you dragged me into the police station, but my gosh, you set me up to be arrested.",
        "Mallet: No I didn't.",
        "Dinah: Yes, you did. You put me in that interrogation room, you told me you were going to clear me, that I had no worries...",
        "Mallet: Listen to me. I believe you didn't poison anybody. Are you listening to me? I believe you didn't try to hurt Jeffrey or Blake or anyone else.",
        "Dinah: Why, because you have evidence that cleared me?",
        "Mallet: No. Marina thinks you're a prime suspect, but I don't. Why, because I believe you. Okay? Call me blind and naive and stupid or dumb or all of the above, but when you look in my eyes and you tell me that, I believe you.",
        "Dinah: I have to go. I have to go get Clarissa. Hey. What just happened here?",
        "Clarissa: Those girls, they said my that my mom's the blogger from that website. Is that true?",
        "Dinah: Yes, it is true. What else did they say?",
        "Clarissa: That my mom's a freak, everyone in my family is, and you, too.",
        "Dinah: Well, they may be right about that one.",
        "Clarissa: It's so hard at school, you don't even know!",
        "Dinah: Okay. You're right. I don't. It was different for me when I was your age. I grew up in one of these.",
        "Clarissa: A carnival?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I was in a different town every night.",
        "Clarissa: That's way better than school. What did daddy do in the carnival?",
        "Dinah: He wasn't here.",
        "Clarissa: What about your mom?",
        "Dinah: Nope.",
        "Clarissa: You were all alone?",
        "Dinah: Come here. Let's just say they didn't know that I was alone for that many years. But I had the carnival people. They were there. They were my friends. They taught me how to knife throw, and be a little snake charmer. Look, I know that things are just not good right now, and I know that they're really bad, but you have a whole lot to be happy about. When I was going up, you know what I did? I became obsessed with looking at the kids with their parents, and they were normal and the parents were normal and that's all I wanted. I just wanted a family. I wanted to be normal.",
        "Clarissa: Did you get it?",
        "Dinah: No, I didn't. Not right away, at least.",
        "Clarissa: Were you really sad?",
        "Dinah: Sometimes. But can I tell you something? You will never, ever have to be that sad about anything, because you have a home, you have a family that is absolutely crazy about you, and you belong somewhere.",
        "Clarissa: I miss dad.",
        "Dinah: I know you do. I do, too. But you've got your brothers, and you've got your mom. Hey, hey, stop it. Don't do that. She loves you. She thinks you are absolutely beautiful and smart and perfect, no matter what.",
        "Clarissa: Even when I mess up?",
        "Dinah: Especially when you mess up. That's when she's supposed to remind you, and she will and she does. Honey listen, I want you to forget about those knuckle-head girls and remember one thing: You are very lucky, because you have something that is so special. You have somebody that believes in you, okay. And that is very cool. All right? Not everybody gets that. Not everybody gets that.",
        "Dinah: You feel better?",
        "Clarissa: Yeah.",
        "Dinah: Good. Listen, let's pack up your stuff and go back to my mom's. Okay?",
        "Clarissa: One last game?",
        "Dinah: Alright, go ahead.",
        "Clarissa: Cool. Hi, Mallet.",
        "Mallet: Hi, sweetie.",
        "Dinah: Hey.",
        "Mallet: Hey.",
        "Dinah: We're going to take Clarissa back to my mom's.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I heard that.",
        "Dinah: And, you know, we're going to go ahead and figure out whatever is going on with social services, but I guess your job is done here today.",
        "Mallet: I heard all of that, I mean, what you said to your little sister.",
        "Mia: Ah, there you are. This place is dead. Maybe we should stage a mugging or something. What? It's reality TV. You think it's real?",
        "Dinah: What did you say?",
        "Mia: Editing, staging, it's a show.",
        "Dinah: Okay.",
        "Mallet: Wait, wait, Dinah...",
        "Dinah: No, no. I'm just keeping it real. You need something real. Hello. Hi, I'm Dinah Marler. You might recognize me from my mug-shot.",
        "Mallet: Stop, stop.",
        "Dinah: I am the prime suspect in the poisoning election case.",
        "Mia: Our research department didn't even know you were a suspect. Detective Mallet, is that why the engagement's off?",
        "Mallet: No, no.",
        "Dinah: You what? It's been off.",
        "Mallet: Shut up.",
        "Dinah: I am going to talk without a lawyer.",
        "Mallet: She didn't do anything, okay. Dinah Marler is no longer a suspect in this case. I've questioned her.",
        "Mia: What about the evidence?",
        "Mallet: Dinah's word is as solid as any evidence we have. Yeah, she is impulsive, yeah, she's difficult, she always seems to land right in the hot water, like she is actually aiming for it. What people don't see, because I don't think people are looking, they don't realize how beautiful she is, and they don't realize how strong she is, and how she cares for the people that she loves, even when some of those people don't return the favor. And how hard she tries to fit in. She's anything but common. She's always getting kicked when she's down, sometimes by those people that she expects better from. And she deserves better. And she's always picking herself up. I don't always know why. It's not like life is getting any kinder for her. But she keeps coming back for more, maybe hoping the next time around... maybe hoping the next time around, she can finally stop running and she can get back to hogging all the sheets and singing in my shower, making me laugh like no one else can. And she can finally stop running... and just come back. Did you get all of that?",
        "Dinah: I got it. I got it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clarissa: Thanks, Dinah, I had so much fun.",
        "Dinah: Really?",
        "Clarissa: Yeah, it was great, you're my favorite sister.",
        "Dinah: Oh, hey, I'm your only sister.",
        "Clarissa: Yeah, I know, but you're the best ever.",
        "Dinah: Thanks.",
        "Clarissa: Are you still going away?",
        "Dinah: No, I think I'm going to stick around.",
        "Clarissa: Thanks for the purple monkey, Mallet.",
        "Mallet: You're welcome, sweetie.",
        "Dinah: All right. Go on, scoot. And don't forget to tell my mother how perfect I am. Okay?",
        "Mia: All right, back to work. It's happy hour. We can catch some underage drinkers down at Springfield U.",
        "Mallet: Oh, that's not my beat.",
        "Mia: Detective, if you don't give us anything we can use...",
        "Mallet: Oh!",
        "Mia: What's wrong, baby?",
        "Mallet: Floating cartilage. Remember that old football injury. It's acting up",
        "Dinah: Oh, yeah. He blew out his knee. And he was going to go pro, but it didn't happen.",
        "Cameraman: Really? For who?",
        "Dinah: Cubs...",
        "Mallet: Bears.",
        "Dinah: Actually, the bears.",
        "Mia: That's confusing, same animal.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I can't work in the field like this. Maybe I should go down to the police station and put some ice on it and put it up on a desk. Maybe just file some case files today.",
        "Mia: Desk work?",
        "Mallet: Oh! Oh, boy, inflammation.",
        "Dinah: Okay, alright. He's sorry, he got to reschedule. See you guys later.",
        "Mallet: Just like old times.",
        "Dinah: Better.",
        "Mia: I knew it.",
        "Mallet: Oh, boy! It's been real.",
        "Dinah: Look at you! Lying to the D.A., to the producers. I think I might have a bad influence on you. What do you think?",
        "Mallet: Well, you know all that stuff I said before to the camera? Dinah? What?",
        "Dinah: No, no, no. If those were lies, I get it. I mean, I get it if you were just trying to cover up... it's... you know what, I should probably go. I should go because I don't want you to have to be uncomfortable about anything.",
        "Mallet: I just spent all day trying to convince you that I believe in you. How about you believing in me for a change?",
        "Dinah: You meant it?",
        "Mallet: Yes, but it has to go both ways. I didn't get such a rough childhood, I didn't get such a rough hand dealt to me. But I need you to believe in me, instead of always waiting for me to disappoint you. You hadn't thought of that one, right?",
        "Dinah: No.",
        "Mallet: Don't give up on us this time.",
        "Dinah: You can't expect us to be perfect, Mallet. Even if we want it to be.",
        "Mallet: Okay. Well, then I fully intend to screw up like last time, and screw up every time.",
        "Dinah: Good, Mallet. I'm really looking forward to it.",
        "Mallet: I'm just trying to do the truth thing.",
        "Dinah: I think that we should do the good thing.",
        "Mallet: I'm just saying it can be different this time. We won't leave this time, ever. Even if one of us drops the ball. Okay? And someone is probably going to drop the ball again because the rest of our lives is a long time.",
        "Dinah: Right.",
        "Mallet: Look, what I'm saying is, this is who we are. This is the way we are together, okay. But leaving is not an option anymore, okay? I mean, even if I have to lock you up in here. The window is too high to jump.",
        "Dinah: Oh, good, you already checked.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, are we fighting again?",
        "Dinah: Mallet, what? You want our future to suck?",
        "Mallet: No. Oh, this is coming out wrong.",
        "Dinah: You think?",
        "Mallet: What I want to say is, just promise me you won't leave me again, okay? Okay? Just promise me I won't have to chase you around at a carnival or spill my guts on reality TV again. Promise me you'll always come back to me.",
        "Dinah: I promise. You had me at carnival.",
        "Mallet: Something else.",
        "Dinah: No. Don't, come on. Don't mess it up. Shut up.",
        "Mallet: When you were talking to Clarissa at the carnival and said you used to wake up in a new place every day...",
        "Dinah: Yeah.",
        "Mallet: ...Well, how about if you wake up here every day permanently.",
        "Dinah: Thank you.",
        "Mallet: You're looking at the window again.",
        "Dinah: Not to escape. Not to escape. It's beautiful.",
        "Mallet: Wow, check that out.",
        "Dinah: I think it's the frost moon. Hold on, hold on, hold on to this perfect moment sometimes every big sky is so free in an instant, it just happens not wishing, not dreaming this time. Just feel it, inhale it, like it's so forever surrender, this time, it's mine hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on to this perfect moment hold on, hold on, hold on to this perfect moment hold on, hold on, hold on...",
