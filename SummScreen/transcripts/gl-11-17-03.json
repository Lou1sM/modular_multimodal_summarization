        "Harley (Whispering): Gus! Gus? ",
        "Gus: Hey, just testing your reflexes. \n",
        "Harley: Well put it down. Come on, this is a \r\nstakeout. Stop the funny business. ",
        "Gus: Put it down. (Sighs) You know, I \r\ncannot stand these stalking cases. What kind of person hustles a pregnant lady? \r\nGet anything? ",
        "Harley: Hmm. Well, I'll tell you this, \r\nthere's not a single neighbor of Andrea's who has any idea who's been stalking \r\nher. I don't know, my money is still on the father. Of course, it could be... it \r\ncould be any random creep for all I know. ",
        "Gus: This guy wasn't successful in breaking \r\nin last night. I'm sure he'll be back tonight. We're just going to have to wait, \r\nthat's all. You hear me? ",
        "Harley: Yeah, we're going to have to wait, \r\njust us, alone in the dark. ",
        "Gus: Oh, thank God you're here. You can help \r\nme stay awake. ",
        "*\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *",
        "Alan: Well, Lucia, what a surprise! \n",
        "Lucia: It's been a long, long time. \n",
        "Alan: Yes, too long as a matter of fact.\r\n",
        "Lucia: How is our son? ",
        "Alan: Our son is an incredible young man. As \r\na matter of fact, my relationship with Gus is probably the best thing in my life \r\nright now. ",
        "Lucia: Oh, that makes me so happy to know \r\nthat you two are getting along. ",
        "Alan: You know what, why don't we three have \r\ndinner together? ",
        "Lucia: No, I don't think so. ",
        "Alan: Oh, all right. Well, maybe the two of \r\nus could have dinner. ",
        "Lucia: Just you and me? ",
        "Alan: Yes, after all, we have to eat, we \r\nshare a child, we might as well share a meal. ",
        "Lucia: Are you asking me out on a date?\r\n",
        "Alan: (Laughs) You know, I think Gus would \r\nbe delighted to know that his mom and dad had a date together. ",
        "Lucia: Well, Alan, I'm flattered, and I \r\nappreciate the offer, but I'm not dating these days. Nuns don't date. \n",
        "Alan: Hmm. ",
        "*\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *",
        "Lizzie: Mom, I'm playing the nurse. What \r\ncould be more boring? ",
        "Beth: I won't tell your grandmother you said \r\nthat. ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, but Mom, Nanna saves lives. The \r\nnurse in this play is nothing like that. I'm going to be this old badly dressed \r\nnurse and Tammy's going to be the star. I mean, she's already got this great \r\nboyfriend and she's pretty, and I have to wait on her? ",
        "Beth: Lizzie, Lizzie, you are beautiful and \r\ntalented and you have so much to offer. But this isn't about you not getting the \r\nlead. It's about the fact that Tammy did, isn't it? ",
        "Lizzie: Well, she's my friend and I'm happy \r\nfor her, I really am. She's going to be great. ",
        "*\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *",
        "Michelle: I love this one, I really do. It's \r\na little J-Lo for me, but maybe for Marina. You know, she's a diva in the \r\nmaking. ",
        "Marah: Yeah, definitely. ",
        "Michelle: Hey you, we were just talking about \r\nyou. ",
        "Marah: Oh my goodness, do not tell me you and \r\nShayne have been sleeping all day. ",
        "Marina: Uh, oh, yeah, well, you know, on and \r\noff. ",
        "Marah: Well, is Shayne coming down with \r\nsomething? Because if he is, I can call the nurse and have her come over. \n",
        "Michelle: I don't think they need the nurse.\r\n",
        "Marina: No, he's good, actually. He's really \r\ngood. We're both really good. ",
        "Marah: Okay, well, that's good. ",
        "Marina: Yeah. What is that? ",
        "Michelle: I was wondering... ",
        "Marina: What's it doing there? ",
        "Marah: It's checking for footprints. \n",
        "Marina: Marah, our dads have installed a \r\nstate-of-the-art security system. What's going on? ",
        "Michelle: Did somebody come through the \r\ntunnel? ",
        "Marah: No, you know, it's been boarded up, \r\nbut you never know. I just, I had is really weird encounter the other day with \r\nthis woman at the house, and it kind of freaked me out, so I'm just making sure \r\nthat nobody that's not invited can get in. ",
        "Michelle: Wait a minute, a woman? What did \r\nshe look like? ",
        "Marah: Mm, like something out of an old \r\nmovie. ",
        "Michelle: Circa 1930s, blonde hair, high \r\nheels, like the bone structure out of, out of, like, a sergeant painting? \n",
        "Marah: Yeah, you've seen her? ",
        "Michelle: She's the one who did the \r\nunsolicited redecorating of my living room. Apparently she had some very strong \r\nfeelings about where my sofa should be. ",
        "Marina: Wait, does she have an opinion about \r\neverything like who you are and what you do? ",
        "Marah: Oh, my gosh, you saw her, too? \n",
        "Marah: Well, yeah, at Company. I mean, I \r\nmean, I thought it was kind of weird, but she was nice. I guess I didn't think \r\nmuch of it. ",
        "Marina: There's got to be an explanation for \r\nthis, other than that we're all going crazy at the same time. ",
        "Michelle: An explanation other than she's a \r\nghost? ",
        "*\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *",
        "Alan: The last time I saw you, I thought you \r\nsaid you were leaving the order and rejoining the civilian world. ",
        "Lucia: I know, I couldn't do it. I realized \r\nthis is where I belong. ",
        "Alan: Hmm. ",
        "Lucia: But that doesn't mean we can't be \r\nfriends. You look like you could use a friend. Are you happy, Alan? ",
        "Alan: Am I \"happy\"? What kind of a question \r\nis that? I have my son, he's good for me. ",
        "Lucia: And now that you've won his heart, the \r\nthrill is gone. ",
        "Alan: Oh no, no, no. I still enjoy winning \r\nand enjoy the spoils. But I am happy that Gus is in my life, my family. \n",
        "Lucia: Yeah, I believe you. And why is it I, \r\nI sense an emptiness inside you? ",
        "Alan: I think you're analyzing a little too \r\nmuch. Now, my life isn't perfect, but no one's is. It's very full, and I think \r\nthat is due primarily to Gus. I want you to see for yourself. Where can I reach \r\nyou? ",
        "Lucia: I've been assigned to St. Michael's on \r\n5th Street. ",
        "Alan: Hmm. ",
        "Lucia: Actually, I never left town. \n",
        "Alan: Now, does Gus know this? ",
        "Lucia: No. I wanted him to have some time to \r\nsort things out for himself, but I, I just couldn't bring myself to leave him \r\nand go back to Chicago. ",
        "Alan: Hmm. Well, I can understand that.\r\n",
        "Lucia: It makes me so happy to know that \r\nhe\u2019s... he's taken you into his life. ",
        "Alan: I think it's been good for both of us.\r\n",
        "Lucia: Then why is it I've never seen you \r\nlook more alone? ",
        "*\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *",
        "Gus: I forgot how difficult it is to be close \r\nto you and not be able to really actually be close to you. You know what I mean?\r\n",
        "Harley: Yes. I don't know what's wrong with \r\nus, I really don\u2019t. I mean, we used to be good at this. ",
        "Gus: Now, wait a second, we're still good at \r\nthis. We're great at this. ",
        "Harley: Maybe it's because I had this whole \r\nromantic night planned for us and we had to shift gears so quickly. ",
        "Gus: Hmm. You know, you think it would be \r\neasier for us to keep our mind on our jobs now that we are together. ",
        "Harley: Yeah, because there's no more, you \r\nknow, tension. There's no mystery, really. ",
        "Gus: No, no, no, no. You see, for me it's now \r\nthat I know what I'm missing. I'm actually missing it a whole lot more. Maybe, \r\nmaybe we could just talk about what we would do to each other after we catch our \r\nbad guy, what do you think? ",
        "Harley: (Laughs) ",
        "(Distant noise) ",
        "*\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *",
        "Michelle: What are you doing? ",
        "Marina: I'm putting in a call to \r\nGhostbusters. (Laughs) ",
        "Michelle: Ha-ha. ",
        "Marina: Oh, my God. You cannot be serious. \r\nYou really think that she's a ghost? Wait, Marah, will you please help me snap \r\nher out of this? ",
        "Marah: You know, anything's possible. \n",
        "Michelle: Oh, maybe \"ghost\" isn't the right \r\nword, okay? I don't know, \"spirit\" maybe? ",
        "Marah: And why would she be seeking out the \r\nthree of us? ",
        "Marina: Okay, you guys, we need to be real \r\nabout this here. I mean, she can't possibly be a ghost, because everyone knows \r\nghosts don't come out during the day. ",
        "Marah: Says who? Look, okay, I'm not saying \r\nthat she is a ghost, but I think we can all agree that what she's doing is \r\nweird. ",
        "Michelle: Yeah, and I'd like to know what she \r\nwants from us. ",
        "Carrie: I'm getting a headache listening to \r\nall of this nonsense. If you three keep on prattling about ghosts, people are \r\ngoing to think you're insane. I want to assure you that I am very, very real.\r\n",
        "Michelle: Um, how-how-how did you get in \r\nhere? ",
        "Carrie: Ah, yes. ",
        "Michelle: Because I've never seen you enter \r\nor exit any room. ",
        "Carrie: You're the clever one, aren't you? \r\nWell, my dear, didn't you know, there are tunnels all over Springfield. \n",
        "Marina: Sort of like a town underneath a \r\ntown? ",
        "Carrie: Oh, I can remember a time when the \r\nyoung people of Springfield were much more adventurous. They explored every inch \r\nof those tunnels. Well, I expect today it's more indoor games. It's a pity, \r\nreally. ",
        "Michelle: Ah, okay, well, who built all these \r\ntunnels? ",
        "Carrie: The same man who built all of the old \r\nhouses in this town. Every single one of them has a secret door, a hidden \r\ncupboard, a little staircase that leads into the tunnels. ",
        "Marina: Wait, so it's kind of like a standard \r\nfeature, sort of like a fridge? ",
        "Marah: In every house? ",
        "Carrie: You all think you lead separate \r\nlives, won't you? But you don\u2019t. It's a pity. Maybe that's what's wrong with the \r\nmodern world. None of us realize that everything we do, every action we take has \r\nan effect on other people. ",
        "*\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *",
        "Beth: Are you and Tammy okay? ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, let's see, she has everything \r\nand I have nothing. Other than that, we're cool. ",
        "Beth: That is not... ",
        "Lizzie: Mom, I know it's not a competition, \r\nokay? ",
        "Beth: You know, I didn't even know you were \r\neven interested in theater again. ",
        "Lizzie: Well, I wasn't, and then I heard \r\nabout the play, and I really wanted to do something normal. My only \r\nextracurricular is my therapy. ",
        "Beth: Okay, okay. But if the point is to be a \r\npart of something, does it really matter what part you play? ",
        "Lizzie: Look who's talking, Miss Prom Queen.\r\n",
        "Beth: Honey, the only people who noticed me \r\nin high school were your father and Uncle Rick. But this isn't about me. \n",
        "Lizzie: I just want to be someone different \r\nthan Crazy Lizzie. ",
        "Beth: Are the other kids in school giving you \r\na hard time now that you're back? ",
        "Lizzie: No, they're not saying anything. It's \r\nlike they're scared of me. They're scared I'm going to fall off the deep end, \r\njust like you. ",
        "Beth: That is not true. You are doing very \r\nwell these days. ",
        "Lizzie: Mom, we both know that I\u2019m one \r\nincident away from being locked in a padded cell, and now I've got to play some \r\nfrumpy old nurse? ",
        "Beth: You know, I don't think you're aware of \r\nwhat a great part this is. ",
        "Lizzie: Oh yeah, I've heard a real scene \r\nstealer. Mom, the fact is, if Romeo and Juliet had a slave, it would\u2019ve been the \r\nnurse. I don't even think she made it to the screen version with Leo. \n",
        "Beth: The nurse is more than a go-between. \r\nShe's at the heart of everything that happens. ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, Mom, but the nurse... Juliet \r\ngets to fall in love and die. The nurse, she's just the messenger. ",
        "Beth: The nurse requires maturity and guts. \r\nShe doesn't get to stand up there and hide behind some pretty costume or some \r\npretty boy. She has to stand there bravely. If anyone can do that, that's you.\r\n",
        "Lizzie: Right. ",
        "Beth: Honey, it's easy to play the girl the \r\nboy loves. It's a lot harder to play someone who's lost so much already. \n",
        "Lizzie: Like what? ",
        "Beth: Her innocence. At the start of the \r\nplay, the nurse is a widow who's lost both her husband and her child. But then, \r\nshe doesn't give up on love. And when Romeo and Juliet find each other, the \r\nnurse falls in love with love all over again. She sees it as this pure and \r\ninnocent thing. But then she's the one that realizes this love will end badly. \r\nShe's the one who realizes that love doesn't always triumph and that it's not \r\ninnocent at all. She knows that when you give in to love passion, heartbreak and \r\ndisaster follows, and she tries to tell Juliet that, but Juliet doesn't listen. \r\nAnd look where love got Juliet. We all know her story, don't we? ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, not as well as you do, Mom.\r\n",
        "*\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *",
        "Alan: I'm anything but lonely, Lucia. \n",
        "Lucia: I didn't say \"lonely,\" I said \"alone.\" \r\nBut since you mentioned it... ",
        "Alan: I have everything that I want, \r\neverything that I need. ",
        "Lucia: When is the last time you sang, Alan?\r\n",
        "Alan: When is the last time I sang? What are \r\nyou doing... ",
        "Lucia: Yes. ",
        "Alan: ...Recruiting for your church choir?\r\n",
        "Lucia: (Laughs) ",
        "Alan: I mean, Lucia, that was a long time \r\nago, and it was a private thing between you and me. We were very different \r\npeople then. ",
        "Lucia: Now, I know that, but it's a shame to \r\nstop doing something that you love so much. Singing made you so happy. It's a \r\nshame to deny ourselves life's simple pleasures. ",
        "Alan: Ah, says the woman hiding behind the \r\ncloth. ",
        "Lucia: That's different. This is a calling.\r\n",
        "Alan: Yes, and Spaulding is calling. Look, I \r\ndon't understand why you're concerning yourself with such silly things like my \r\nsinging. ",
        "Lucia: Because I want Gus to know. I want our \r\nson to know that behind that gruff exterior of yours there is a big heart and a \r\nbig soul. I'd hope that you'd be more open to the people that love you, but... I \r\nknow, you know, it's not my place to judge you, but there's a sadness in you, \r\nAlan. It's not too late to be the man that you were meant to be. ",
        "Alan: Well, I appreciate your concern, and I \r\ncan also tell you that this gruffness that I have and lack of soul has had no \r\neffect on Gus. He was a fully formed young man when he came here. ",
        "Lucia: How's Phillip? ",
        "Alan: Well, Phillip, is another matter. \r\nThings are not going well for Phillip now. Matter of fact, his whole life is \r\ncaving in around him. ",
        "Lucia: Can you help him? ",
        "Alan: He doesn't want to be helped, \r\nespecially from me. ",
        "Lucia: You're not going to give up, are you, \r\nAlan? You give him the support and the unconditional love that your father never \r\ngave you. But first, you need to help yourself. ",
        "Alan: Lucia, I... ",
        "Lucia: You have to be true to yourself before \r\nyou can be true to your children. If you need me, you know where to find me.\r\n",

        "Gus: Freeze! ",
        "Phillip: Oh, no, wh...? ",
        "Please stay with us for the ",
        "Harley: Phillip, what are you doing here?\r\n",
        "Phillip: (Laughs) So you found her, too. \r\nHave you talked to her? ",
        "Harley: Of course, we've talked to her. How \r\ndo you even know her? ",
        "Phillip: How do I know the woman that's \r\nhaving my baby? ",
        "Harley: Are we talking about Olivia? \n",
        "Phillip: Who else? ",
        "Harley: You think Olivia lives here? \n",
        "Harley: Harley, I asked you to find her and \r\nyou found her. ",
        "Gus: Not a very bright move busting into this \r\napartment. You got the wrong girl, pal. ",
        "Phillip: The wrong girl? I saw Olivia with my \r\nown eyes. ",
        "Harley: You saw her? ",
        "Phillip: Yeah. ",
        "Harley: When exactly did you see her? \n",
        "Phillip: I saw her on the street. There were \r\nother people with her, but I know it was her. I'd know her anywhere. ",
        "Gus: Did you talk to her? ",
        "Phillip: No, no, uh-uh. I just, I followed \r\nher back here enough to keep my eye on her ever since. ",
        "Gus: So what was all this then? You were just \r\nsurprising her? ",
        "Phillip: Well, I had to get everything right \r\nfor the baby. I know I shouldn't have come in that way, but, you know, I've got \r\nto talk to her sometime. You know, I have to get things set before the baby \r\ncomes. ",
        "Gus: This is not Olivia's home. ",
        "Phillip: Well, I know that. No, this baby \r\nbelongs with me. ",
        "Gus: No, I mean, this apartment belongs to \r\nanother person. It belongs to a woman named Andrea. ",
        "Phillip: Okay, well, if Andrea let Olivia \r\nstay here, I'll write her a check. ",
        "Harley: No, no, Phillip, Phillip listen to \r\nme. What Gus is trying to say you... ",
        "Phillip: Oh, come here, I want to show you \r\nsomething. Come here, I want to show you what I brought the baby. No, wait a \r\nminute, I bet you can guess. ",
        "Harley: I, I can\u2019t. ",
        "Phillip: No, it was Zach's favorite thing, \r\nguess. ",
        "Harley: I can\u2019t. ",
        "Phillip: Guess. ",
        "Harley: I can\u2019t. ",
        "Phillip: Guess. It's a mobile. It's a mobile. \r\nIt's just exactly like the one that we had for Zach. I think she'll really love \r\nit, but I want you to tell me what you think, honestly, because I want \r\neverything to be just right. ",
        "Harley: Phillip, look, I want you to stay \r\nfocused with me he for a second, okay? ",
        "Phillip: Uh-huh. ",
        "Harley: There is a pregnant woman who lives \r\nin this apartment, but she's not Olivia. Okay? We've spoken with her. She's not \r\nOlivia. ",
        "Phillip: So what are you saying? ",
        "Harley: I'm saying she's not here. Olivia was \r\nnever here, honey. We don't know where she is. She's gone. ",
        "Phillip: That's not true. ",
        "Harley: Phillip, it's true. Olivia is gone, \r\nI'm sorry. ",
        "Phillip: You wouldn't do that to me. \n",
        "Gus: Do what, Phillip? ",
        "Phillip: (Giggles) Don't play games with \r\nme. You've been hiding my child from me, all along. ",

        "Lizzie: You haven't really given up on love, \r\nhave you? ",
        "Beth: No, no, of course, not. It's just the \r\nShakespeare. You know, all this love and tragedy really goes to my head. But \r\njust imagine what you'll do to the audience. ",
        "Lizzie: I'm your daughter. You have to think \r\nI'm good. ",
        "Beth: You are going to be good. You're going \r\nto be great. Look at this. \"Go, girl. Seek happy days and happy nights.\" Good \r\nstuff. ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, but it\u2019s still not \"Wherefore \r\nart thou, Romeo?\" And you know it. ",
        "Alan: Hands down the best role in the play is \r\nMercutio. The sword fight... \"A plague on both their houses.\" ",
        "Lizzie: Grandpa, being the nurse is not \r\nenough. I don't want to be a boy. ",
        "Alan: Listen, the nurse is a much better role \r\nthan Juliet. Why, when Dame Edith Evans played it in London, the critics said \r\nthat her performance... ",
        "Lizzie: Newsflash -- I'm not a dame. I'm just \r\na girl in high school. See Grandpa, being Juliet is cool. Being in love, that's \r\ncool. Being a pretty girl, that's really cool, but the nurse is so not cool.\r\n",
        "Beth: Uh-uh-uh, you forgot something.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, if anyone tells me that there \r\nare no small parts again, I'm dropping out, right? ",
        "Alan: Well, it's a good thing I didn't tell \r\nher the real reason I didn't want her to play Juliet. ",
        "Beth: And what's that? ",
        "Alan: The kissing. I couldn't bear to see her \r\nkiss a boy on stage, or off stage for that matter. ",
        "Beth: Well, unfortunately, she's at that age \r\nwhere kissing boys is imminent. You're going to have to get over it, Grandpa.\r\n",
        "Alan: You were about Elizabeth\u2019s age when \r\nyour Romeo came along, weren't you? ",
        "Beth: I think Phillip was more of a Prince \r\nCharming. Rescued me, remember? But in the end, we were no better off than poor \r\nRomeo and Juliet. ",
        "Alan: And what about your present-day Romeo?\r\n",
        "Beth: No Romeo. Jeffrey's history. \n",
        "Alan: Well, he's a stupid man to turn his \r\nback on a beautiful woman like you. ",
        "Beth: I dumped him, Alan. ",
        "Alan: Well, that's good. Things couldn't be \r\nbetter timed. ",
        "Beth: And why is that? ",
        "Alan: Because Phillip needs you, Beth. \n",

        "Michelle: Before we go on, you haven't told \r\nus your name. I mean, you know all about us, but we don't really know anything \r\nabout you. ",
        "Carrie: I'm so sorry. My name is Caroline. \r\nBut you may call me Carrie if you like. Now, what were we talking about? \n",
        "Marah: The tunnels. ",
        "Michelle: Right, they weren't built so people \r\ncould sneak around and rearrange furniture, were they? I mean, were they for \r\ncriminals or rum runners during the prohibition? ",
        "Carrie: Hardly, my dear, hardly. The tunnels \r\nwere built for lovers. Many, many years ago, before any of your families had \r\ncome to Springfield, there were several very important, very powerful families \r\nwho ran this town, and they loathed each other. It was very sad, for the \r\nchildren, particularly for one couple who fell madly, madly in love, but their \r\nfamilies wouldn't let them get together. ",
        "Marina: Oh, wait, I've, I've seen that movie \r\n. And they're doing the play right now at the high school. ",
        "Carrie: One of the young men was my great, \r\ngreat grandfather. He fell in love. He fell in love with a beautiful, beautiful \r\nyoung girl, but their families kept them apart and so she married someone else. \r\nI don't think he ever, ever got over it, so he went away. He went away, and he \r\nstudied and he came as a very famous architect. ",
        "Marah: The same man from before, the one who \r\nbuilt Michelle's house and all the others in the town that looked like it, and \r\nhe also built the tunnels? ",
        "Carrie: Yes. He's the one who suffered \r\nterribly. He never wanted anyone else to suffer the way he had. ",
        "Marah: Well, he went through a lot of trouble \r\nso that kids could hook up. ",
        "Carrie: Yes, he did, didn't he? Hook up, just \r\nlike Romeo and Juliet. My own grandfather taught me the tunnels. I know them by \r\nheart. I learned them as a child. There isn't one house, or building, any place \r\nin Springfield that I can't go. But of course, I've never, ever, interfered with \r\nanybody's private life. ",
        "Michelle: Until now. So what made you change \r\nyour mind to start showing up everywhere, like my living room? ",
        "Carrie: It was so wonderful for me to see you \r\nto be so happy in a house that you have loved ever since you were... you were a \r\nlittle girl. ",
        "Michelle: How did you know that? ",
        "Carrie: Oh. Oh, my dears, I make it my \r\nbusiness to know lots of important things about very important people. \n",
        "Marah: And where exactly do you live? \n",
        "Marina: Well, maybe, maybe she doesn't live, \r\nyou know, like anywhere in particular. ",
        "Carrie: Where do I live? Why, I live in my \r\nown house, the house that my great, great grandfather built for my family, the \r\nhouse that you live in. ",
        "Michelle: You live in my house with my \r\nfamily? ",
        "Carrie: Yes, my dear, I do. I would have \r\nnever, ever spoken to you except for the fact that I simply could not bear that \r\nfurniture arrangement one more second. (Laughs) ",
        "Michelle: So you've been living in my house \r\nall along? The house was closed up for years, and then before that, there was a \r\nreally nice family that lived there, so how... ",
        "Carrie: But there's a wing. There's a \r\ndeserted wing that was closed up for years. I didn't sell that when I put the \r\nhouse on the market, so I've been living there all this time, a quiet, quiet \r\ncomfortable little place all my own. Except it was quiet until, of course, that \r\nteam of carpenters came in and began to put that terrible bookcase on the wall. \r\nThat really was the most dreadful idea... ",
        "Michelle: Okay, I really don't want your \r\ndesign advice right now. What happens now? Are you going to just keep popping in \r\nand popping out? ",
        "Marina: I think it's kind of fun. ",
        "Michelle: Well, I'm a little uncomfortable \r\nwith the idea of you living with me and my family. ",
        "Carrie: But I was so hoping we could all be \r\nfriends. You must promise me something. You must never, never tell anyone that \r\nyou saw me. If you do, I'll have to disappear again. ",
        "Marina: Well, why? Are you, are you, like, on \r\nthe run from the law, are you a fugitive? ",
        "Carrie: Oh, hardly. ",
        "Marah: Okay, so why should we keep your \r\nsecret? ",
        "Carrie: Because, if you keep my secret, I'll \r\ntell you a secret. I'll tell you a story, a wonderful dark story that concerns \r\neveryone in Springfield. I think you'll like it, but you must promise never, \r\never to tell a soul. Otherwise I'll go away, and my story will go with me. Now, \r\nyou must promise me. Promise me that you'll never, ever tell a soul, and \r\nsomeday, someday, I think you'll all understand why. ",
