        "Cassie: Hey, Bill.",
        "Bill: Harley, it's me, Bill. Call me. We've got to talk about our friend Ruth. All right.",
        "Olivia: Hey.",
        "Bill: Hey, you, what's going on? Hey, little girlie-girl.",
        "Olivia: Is this your Spaulding Mall? So was it an accident that you hired a possible murderer, or did you do it on purpose?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: It's not too late to turn back.",
        "Tammy: It's about time I started dealing with things. This is where JB took me and left me dancing with his friends. Then I ran outside.",
        "Sandy: And the rest was major internal damage for yours truly. But, hey, look at me now but I'm surviving and thriving.",
        "Tammy: Sandy, you saved me from being crushed by that car. You're letting me stay with you now. You hid me from Aunt Reva. I know how hard it was to lie to her.",
        "Sandy: No big deal.",
        "Tammy: And I know that you want to help me. But you can't protect me from every bad thing out there.",
        "Dinah: Well, look who's here. Welcome back, Tammy. (Water splashes) (coughs)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: What's the matter? Never saw a guy taking a well- deserved break? I'm going to inspect this fountain, my friend, and if I find anything wrong, I'm reporting you to the proper authorities! How you doing, Mom? I saved you a spot.",
        "Reva: No, thank you. Get out of there right now.",
        "Jonathan: Why? I had a reservation.",
        "Jimmy: Mrs. Lewis, I'm really sorry about this scene.",
        "Reva: He's my son.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, it's hard to say out loud, isn't it? How can I be your son? Lizzie Spaulding just told me I'm nobody. Maybe she's right. In fact--and this is a little known fact--but technically I'm dead. So no harm, no foul. Come on, don't just stand there, Reva, come on in! The water's fine!",
        "Reva: Get out now! (crying)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: Save your condolences. You hated my dad like everyone else in this town.",
        "Coop: The man is dead, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: You better not gloat about it, Coop.",
        "Coop: I know it must feel like that whole world is against you right now.",
        "Lizzie: It is.",
        "Coop: Well, maybe most of it is.",
        "Lizzie: You act like I never cry.",
        "Coop: I know the Spaulding's aren't very big on emoting, but if you can't cry for your father... it's not like I'm going to tell anybody else that you're human.",
        "Lizzie: What are you... what are you doing?",
        "Coop: I'm dropping off my suit. I'm sorry about what happened to your father. Really, I am. This is something I wouldn't wish on anybody, especially the way this happened. But your father is gone and so my work for you is over so I....",
        "Lizzie: You're quitting? I don't think so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: What do you know about your pal, Ruth?",
        "Bill: Enough. You have no know that she's no more capable of killing Phillip than you are, and we both know you didn't do it, right?",
        "Olivia: Not that it matters. I have a boatload of motive and my alibi is shaky and I have a feeling they might want to pin it on me because Alan and the newspapers might like it. You have to let me know where she is.",
        "Bill: I don't know.",
        "Olivia: You heard Alan demand that Frank arrest me, right?",
        "Bill: Look, I know there was a chance of things getting out of control but I know that...",
        "Olivia: What things are you talking about?",
        "Bill: Look, all you need to know is that my plan is to keep you safe.",
        "Olivia: I have to feed her. She's on a schedule. We need to talk about this.",
        "Billy: Hey, son.",
        "Bill: Dad.",
        "Billy: I... I see you're still with Olivia.",
        "Bill: We're barely on speaking terms, and that's the way you start a conversation. That's just great.",
        "Billy: I just thought with Phillip gone, you know....",
        "Bill: What? That I'm going to bail on Olivia? Let this deal on her own?",
        "Billy: Look, I'm just trying to show some concern, be a good dad.",
        "Bill: So am I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: All this time I did whatever I could to get your attention, and all I had to do was jump in a fountain? Look at you, thinking it's the perfect time to come be my mom and savior. Well, forget it.",
        "Reva: You couldn't possibly know what I'm thinking right now.",
        "Jonathan: Like I really care. You are just like all those other people walking by. You are just like that glorified butler who wouldn't let me in here for a cheeseburger. I'm not good enough. Never have been, never will be.",
        "Reva: That's enough. Now get out.",
        "Jonathan: What's the matter? You think you're embarrassed now?",
        "Reva: Oh, I'm not embarrassed. You just don't understand.",
        "Jonathan: Step right up, ladies and germs! Come see the freak show in the fountain. Reva Shayne's long-lost, left-for-dead little boy! Come on! Come on! Come! Come see the new loser of Springfield!",
        "Reva: Oh, God. You really are my son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: You had quite a search party looking for you. Did you have good trip?",
        "Tammy: Here are your keys. Thanks for the car.",
        "Dinah: Sure. Sure, yeah. I know what it's like to be on the run. You need all the friends you can get. Just make sure you know what they're wanting in return for helping you out.",
        "Tammy: Is there something that you want, Dinah?",
        "Dinah: Your undying gratitude sweetheart.",
        "Tammy: I'm serious.",
        "Dinah: Me, too. No, don't worry about it.",
        "Tammy: Dinah, I was just wondering one little thing. If... well, do you think if people ask...",
        "Dinah: Tammy, my lips are sealed. I can keep a secret. You know that. I won't tell anybody that you're back among the living. But you do know that's what you've got to keep doing. You've got to keep living. You get me?",
        "Tammy: I guess.",
        "Dinah: Okay. You stay out of trouble, if you can.",
        "Tammy: I can't believe I actually talked to her.",
        "Sandy: You did good. You're strong. You did what you had to do.",
        "Tammy: Sandy, after all that's happened, do I seem different?",
        "Sandy: Different?",
        "Tammy: You know, after what he...",
        "Sandy: No, no, no. That is all in your head. And it is my mission to shake it out. Believe me. The only one thinking those thoughts is you.",
        "Jake: Hey, Tammy, it's Jake, remember? Hey, you're looking hot tonight.",
        "Sandy: We're busy.",
        "Jake: New guy.",
        "Sandy: Hey....",
        "Tammy: See? He knows. He can see what I am.",
        "Sandy: Tammy, no one can see any change.",
        "Cassie: Tammy.",
        "Tammy: Mom?",
        "Cassie: Oh, thank God. Thank God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Bill, you're you saying that Olivia's....",
        "Bill: Pregnant? I'm talking about being a father to Emma, that's what I'm talking about. Judging by your reaction, I can see the kind of support I'd get. Great.",
        "Billy: Hold on. You can't expect me not to have an opinion about her.",
        "Bill: Let's not go on to what she did to Josh, all right?",
        "Billy: That this has to do with you, with the feud she drew you into.",
        "Bill: She didn't draw me into anything.",
        "Billy: Yes, she did. Now Phillip's dead and who knows where that's going to lead?",
        "Bill: Are you implying Olivia killed Phillip? Maybe you think I did?",
        "Billy: Forget it. Look, all I want to do is make amends. I spoke to the guy at INS, I told them your relationship was 100% legitimate.",
        "Bill: Does this mean you're going to back off?",
        "Billy: Are you going to jump into being a father whole hog here?",
        "Bill: Every kid deserves a father, whether it's the one she's born with or the one that stumbles into it. You can accept that or not, it's your choice.",
        "Billy: That's a no-brainer. You're my son. Look, all I want to do is be a part of your life. Truce?",
        "Bill: Yeah, truce. Hey you, what's going on, little girlie? What's going on, little girlie? What's going on?",
        "Olivia: Stop it. Just cut the act. Your father left, okay?",
        "Bill: What act?",
        "Olivia: I'm not going to let you use my daughter to stick it to your father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: It's your brother's fault my license is suspended in the first place, okay? I just have to wait until they figure out this whole thing with the Sandy Foster hit-and-run mess.",
        "Coop: Hit-and-run mess? Lizzie, you almost killed the guy.",
        "Lizzie: I know. I'm sorry. It's just... I can't drive, Coop. I've got to have you drive me and Roxy around. It's what my dad would have wanted.",
        "Coop: Look, I'm sensitive to what you're going through, really I am. But what your father... what he would have wanted, that doesn't matter right now.",
        "Lizzie: Well, it matters to me, okay? My father had problems, okay? And... the way he lost his life is like a nightmare that I can't even wake up from, and I can only do that if I at least carry out some of his good deeds.",
        "Coop: The way you see things, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: What's so wrong with the way I see things?",
        "Coop: Look, most people would say--and I probably would agree with them--that your father, well, he had a lot of things coming to him.",
        "Lizzie: You think my father deserved to be killed?",
        "Coop: No.",
        "Lizzie: Then why are you acting like it's his fault?",
        "Coop: Lizzie, at the very end your father lost it, he really did. But I know that you loved him. I know that. But, please, do not make him out to be a hero here.",
        "Lizzie: He was a good person.",
        "Coop: Does a good person bulldoze a house that has his child in it? Does he undercut someone's hard work just for fun and laughs? Or does he even steal his own kids? Does a good person do that?",
        "Lizzie: You're just like everyone else.",
        "Coop: Everyone else? You mean normal people? People that don't run away from a hit-and-run accident?",
        "Lizzie: Now this is about me?",
        "Coop: Well, it's about you, your father. Right now it makes no difference. You're the same person.",
        "Lizzie: You know what? You know what the difference is? I'm alive to make you regret what you just said. I can't believe you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I have been out of my mind worrying about you. Are you okay?",
        "Tammy: I'm fine.",
        "Cassie: Why is he with you? What are you doing here?",
        "Sandy: I'm trying to do the right thing. I'm going to go play some darts.",
        "Tammy: What are you doing how did you find me?",
        "Cassie: I got a call.",
        "Tammy: Who called you?",
        "Cassie: Doesn't matter. Can you tell me anything about where you've been all this time, Tammy?",
        "Tammy: Do we have to talk about it right now?",
        "Cassie: No. No. I am just so happy that you are safe. I've missed you, and I've been going out of my mind. You'll realize that when you have kids of your own, and I know you're sick of hearing that. So I just...",
        "Tammy: Mom, what happened?",
        "Cassie: It's just everything with Phillip Spaulding, him taking the children and then the murder, it...",
        "Tammy: I saw the news.",
        "Cassie: I just want my kids around me. Look, I have an idea of what you're going through right now. And I want nothing more than to help you. So we just need to get home.",
        "Tammy: No I'm not going home. Not until I figure out what it is inside me that made me open up to a creep like JB.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Here we go. You're on the verge of one of those movie of the week flash back scenes where all of a sudden everything makes sense to you.",
        "Reva: I have a lot of thoughts in my head right now.",
        "Jonathan: Is anything rattling around in your head about how you could have been a better mother?",
        "Reva: We could go back and forth on that issue all night.",
        "Jonathan: I'd win in the end. You'd have a good story, though. You could play the noble abandonment card, how you left you know to protect me. You've tried selling that to me before, but I ain't buying.",
        "Reva: You know what? You are exhausting. And you're not so very special. I'm sorry, but you're not. You're just like anyone else. You know, standing there in that fountain shivering just like anyone else would. You came here to have dinner, like anyone else, right?",
        "Jonathan: Is this some attempt at getting us to bond? Because if it is, I'd rethink the strategy.",
        "Reva: You feel rejected like anyone else in your situation would. You hurt like anyone else would. You're angry like anyone else is.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. Do you think I desire to be anything else? That hurt, okay? That anger? That's me. Look at me. I'm the boy you'll never be able to take anywhere. I'm the boy that gets voted most likely to create a scene. I'm the boy you wish would go back where he came from.",
        "Reva: That's not true.",
        "Jonathan: Come on, Reva. Now that I'm here, now that I'm standing right here, how are you going to hold on to your dream of some little preppy boy, momma's boy on some deserted island out there living the happy life? All thanks to your great sacrifice? Do you think I see you as some kind of martyr?",
        "Reva: I'm not so very proud of myself. Not as proud of myself as you seem to think I am. In fact, my life...",
        "Jonathan: I don't want to hear. I don't want to hear. I don't want to hear about your problems. I don't want to hear how you managed to survive all these years with some kind of positive attitude. Blah, blah, blah. You finish what you started years ago when you dumped me off on strangers and walk away. Just leave me alone!",
        "Reva: Well, you know what? I'm sorry. But I can't do that. Just because you want people in your life, just because you want people to care doesn't mean you get to call the shots.",
        "Jonathan: That was interesting.",
        "Reva: Oh, yeah. Well I'm an old hand at the fountain jumping cry for attention.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, you were here first?",
        "Reva: You bet I was. I jumped in and I baptized myself the slut of Springfield, screaming at Joshua, pounding on my chest. You didn't happen to do any of those things, did you?",
        "Jonathan: What's your point?",
        "Reva: I made my point. You have no idea about the depth of other people's lives.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, well, why should I care?",
        "Reva: Because your nose is shoved so far up your own life that you don't see that you're destroying yourself. You have to look past. You have to look past your own bitterness and you'll see that you're not alone. Oh, you're in pain? My being in here right now with you, that reminds me of one of the most painful times in my life.",
        "Jonathan: You want to try painful? Try falling off the side of a mountain.",
        "Reva: I'm not just talking about physical pain.",
        "Jonathan: No, no. Neither am I. Honestly what hurt the most was knowing, one, that nobody was going to come looking for me. And, two, the nobody else would realize I was gone.",
        "Reva: You're here now, Jonathan. You are here. And I know you want that to mean something and it does. But just because you want people in your lives, just because you want people to care doesn't mean that you get to call the shots! Now sit down. We're not going anywhere yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Tammy, you can't forget that JB came to town to ruin anything he could. Reva's his target. He went through you to get to her.",
        "Tammy: And I was too stupid to see it.",
        "Cassie: No.",
        "Tammy: Bartender.",
        "Cassie: Unless you are a psychic, Tammy, none of us could have imagined what that kid was going to do.",
        "Tammy: I think it's something in me.",
        "Cassie: ???",
        "Tammy: Something wrong or defective. You said no one could see, but JB saw. He saw something in me that made him think he could get away with what he did.",
        "Cassie: If you're saying he saw a wonderful, trusting....",
        "Tammy: Something that screamed \"victim.\"",
        "Cassie: You're not a victim. You have a strength in you that most people will never know, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: I don't believe that.",
        "Cassie: Well, I do. And I am going to do everything I can to help you now that you're back. I just can't tell you how relieved I am that you left that strip club, that you didn't do something that you were going to regret for the rest of your life.",
        "Tammy: What?",
        "Cassie: I got a call from teasers that you were there looking for a job.",
        "Tammy: So your daughter who has a kind of strength that everyone would love to have just crumbles and sells her body the first chance she gets? Is that what you told Jeffrey O'Neill? Who else did you sell me out to?",
        "Cassie: I didn't sell you out to anyone. Dinah told Jeffrey....",
        "Tammy: Dinah? Dinah promised me...",
        "Cassie: Wait a minute. Dinah promised you what? Have you been talking to her?",
        "Cassie: I never went to Chicago or to that dive that you used to call home. But you thought I would. What does everyone else think, that I'm some slutty loser? I don't want you here right now.",
        "Cassie: I am not leaving you.",
        "Tammy: No, if you don't leave I will.",
        "Cassie: Tammy, you're in pain and you're lashing out. But it's the people standing in front of you that can help you.",
        "Tammy: I don't need your help. I just want to be left alone. Look, I'm not going to disappear. I just can't be with you right now.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Well, you call me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Is that the only way? Is that the only way you Spaulding's know how to deal with people?",
        "Lizzie: You were there when I stood up to him, Coop. I hurt him, just like everyone else. The only thing I didn't get is what he wants from me.",
        "Coop: Don't even tell me all of a sudden, what you've just seen the light, right?",
        "Lizzie: It's up to me to carry out my dad's cause. What else am I supposed to do? What else can I do to make up for it?",
        "Coop: I understand you're suffering right now. I really do. My father almost died and I dedicated practically my life to running that burger joint. Your father's vision of the world was a little more than just screwed up. He died a very lonely man and I don't want to see the same thing end up happening to you.",
        "Lizzie: Just keep driving, we don't pay you for your opinions.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Okay, wait a minute. You're either totally nuts or a complete cynic.",
        "Olivia: Both.",
        "Bill: I'm just trying to do right by your kid here.",
        "Olivia: Billie doesn't see it that way.",
        "Bill: Don't worry about that. I'm telling him what he should be seeing. Everything's above board here. No dirty tricks and I'm definitely not using your daughter to score points. We've got to think about our future.",
        "Olivia: We?",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Olivia: The last time we talked about it you weren't hot on being a father figure to her.",
        "Bill: Wait a minute, now things have changed. Phillip is... Phillip's gone. And I know we haven't done things the conventional way, but Olivia, we can make this right. Emma needs a father. I'm your husband. Aren't I the logical choice for the job?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: We're going to save this night. Yes.",
        "Tammy: By doing what?",
        "Sandy: By having some fun.",
        "Tammy: Oh...",
        "Sandy: Come on. (Laughs) come on! Come here. And dip.",
        "Tammy: (Laughs).",
        "Sandy: Nice. Do you mind?",
        "Jake: Here's my number.",
        "Sandy: Wow. What a jerk.",
        "Tammy: See? I can't even hide it from strangers.",
        "Sandy: Tammy, Tammy, I don't know how many times I have to tell you this. You have nothing to hide.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Emma needs someone who wants to be a father, okay? Not someone stepping in out of a misplaced sense of obligation and I want a husband who wants to be a husband, all right? You and I got married to keep me in the country and preserve our partnership against Phillip. He's gone now.",
        "Bill: What are you saying?",
        "Olivia: Go. This is your chance. This is an opportunity for you to hit the road, freedom, no obligations. Okay? Walk away if you want, Bill. Walk away right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I was a wild child back in the day. In fact, I was the town misfit.",
        "Jonathan: Well, that makes us similar how?",
        "Reva: There was a time when I couldn't join a country club. I grew up poor. Dirt poor. In fact, my momma was the Lewis family housekeeper back in Tulsa.",
        "Jonathan: You've come a long way.",
        "Reva: When I got to Springfield, I felt like the little girl on the outside.",
        "Jonathan: Looking up at the big house on the hill?",
        "Reva: That's right.",
        "Jonathan: Well, you managed to fit in.",
        "Reva: Well, I more like busted my way in. The whole town's eyes were on me, judging me, trying to push me to fit in. So I did the opposite to prove my point. I jumped in here and I made a big fool out of myself.",
        "Jonathan: Not your crowning achievement, huh?",
        "Reva: I thought I was being so strong, you know? Showing Joshua, showing the whole world. But I've never been so scared or sad in my entire life. You have to be so broken inside to do something like that. Lacking in a sense of pride and self-worth. But it doesn't have to be the end of it. You can be whoever you want to be. You don't have to rail at the world, hurting people, hurting yourself. You can just be if you have the courage. That's the end of the lesson. We're both going to get sick if we stay in here.",
        "Jonathan: I'd probably be doing the whole town a favor if I stayed in here and died of pneumonia, huh?",
        "Reva: I have a better idea. Jimmy, I know you're listening. Dinner for two, my usual table. Now, Jimmy.",
        "Jimmy: Um, right away, Mrs. Lewis.",
        "Reva: So? Do you want to stay here and freeze or would you like to join me for a hot meal and perhaps some dry clothes? It's up to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Guys like that never used to give me a second look.",
        "Sandy: You just never noticed it before.",
        "Tammy: You don't think he's noticed that I've changed somehow.",
        "Sandy: No. I don't. Tammy, guys don't have some sixth sense for someone with an emotional trauma. Usually we try and avoid women like that.",
        "Tammy: This is different, Sandy. It's about sex and what they think a girl will or won't do.",
        "Sandy: With sex and guys you tell them what you will or will not do. Look, guys have been looking at you. Guys are probably looking at you right now. Guys will be looking at you for a long time, because you're amazing. You're undeniably gorgeous. You're un... unbelievably smart. You're beyond cool. You know, and anyone who took the time to get to know you would realize you deserve to be treated with the utmost respect and any guy who didn't treat you right is insane. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. If you wait here, I'll go and get the car.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Look, if you want to go through life treating people as rotten as your father did, be my guest. But I just don't get you people. I don't get you at all. You have everything you could possibly ask for but yet you still are not only just unhappy but you're always mad at somebody and you're just mean. Plain-out mean. All right? You never play by the rules and then you kick and scream and cry like a bunch of babies wherever you get caught.",
        "Lizzie: Are you done?",
        "Coop: No. Lizzie, I'm going to pay off the debt I do owe you guys but I'm not going to like it and I'm not going to like you. I can't imagine anybody ever liking you. If they did, I sure as hell don't even know why. Oh, by the way, in case you're trying to keep it and hold it all together so you don't seem so human, feel free to bawl your eyes out as soon as I leave the room.",
        "Lizzie: I hate you!",
        "Coop: Lizzie, at this point I don't even care what you think of me. (Crying)",
        "Lizzie: I can't let anybody talk about my daddy like that. They can't ever forget him. I'm going to make sure of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Wait a minute, Olivia, you walk away from this marriage you can get deported. My dad's trying to say he fixed everything but I do not believe him.",
        "Olivia: That's not a good reason to stay.",
        "Bill: You can't go to San Cristobel alone.",
        "Olivia: You're a good guy but there weren't supposed to be any strings.",
        "Bill: Is this a reverse psychologist thing? You know I'm the hero type and I don't scare easily. That's what you...",
        "Olivia: Emma, this is a man chasing his own tail.",
        "Bill: Am I right?",
        "Olivia: You don't need for me that thing you just did there.",
        "Bill: I am right.",
        "Olivia: Sometimes women what they mean what they say. Sometimes they mean what they say. Bottom line is that you can't play around with Emma's life unless you're willing to commit to that. Look, there, it's okay.",
        "Bill: What are you talking about? I didn't say no. I'm thinking.",
        "Olivia: That's a real challenge for you, we know. That.",
        "Bill: Give a guy a anybody to find the perfect way to say yes. Look, this is where I want to be. Right here. With you. With Emma. All right?",
        "Olivia: Don't eat her cookie.",
        "Bill: Let's go home and put the past behind us. And then we're going to get...",
        "Olivia: We can do that for now. Okay?",
        "Bill: All right. One day at a time, I guess.",
        "Olivia: Well, tomorrow's Phillip's funeral.",
        "Bill: Yeah. Yeah. You still think we should go?",
        "Olivia: He said that the whole town is suspects, so personally I wouldn't miss it for the world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: You're not coming?",
        "Jonathan: Man's gotta eat. But don't... don't think this is the road to recovery. I'm... I'm not sure I like you.",
        "Reva: Why don't you go into the pro shop, I'm sure they can find something that will fit.",
        "Jonathan: What, like a... like a golf shirt and some khaki pants? I think I'd rather catch knew pneumonia.",
        "Billy: What have you done to her now?",
        "Reva: Billy, it's okay. Really, it's fine.",
        "Jonathan: You're buying.",
        "Reva: He wanted to create a scene. Who better than me to talk him down?",
        "Billy: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Reva: At least now I know who he is. I mean, him in the fountain? Me in the fountain.",
        "Billy: I wouldn't read too much into that.",
        "Reva: I can't help it.",
        "Billy: Come on. Everybody knows that kid is trouble.",
        "Reva: (Laughs) Oh, my God, Billy! So was I! He's me. (Laughs)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: I don't think you're going to have a lot of company in that love fest because Phillip made a lot of enemies before he left this earth. Any number of people wanted him dead. Including the three of us, right? Huh?",
        "Gus: I think you know.",
        "Harley: I think you think it will be too much. That the guilt will be too much and I'll end up making some tragic graveside confession to killing Phillip."
