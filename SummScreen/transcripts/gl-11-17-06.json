        "Buzz: ...To scare the koala bear. Ah! ( Knock on the door ) Oh, thank you for coming. Thank God you're here.",
        "Coop: Uh-huh. Did you deliver the eggs?",
        "Buzz: ( Laughs ) Look who's here! We have Brother Bunny.",
        "Coop: Brother Bunny?",
        "Buzz: Brother Bunny.",
        "Coop: No. No, Dad, no way.",
        "Buzz: Oh, come on. Please, come on. I'm hopping myself into a heart attack here. Come on.",
        "Coop: Dad, I don't hop. I don't hop.",
        "Buzz: Look, you can't... when a beautiful young thing asks you to do something, you have to do it. What do you want Brother Bunny to do?",
        "Emma: Hop.",
        "Buzz: Hop. So hop, come on.",
        "Coop: This is humiliating. You know this, right?",
        "Buzz: Hopping's fun! Come on. We're a family of hoppers! Come on. Hopping's fun.",
        "Coop: It's fun. Are there cameras around here somewhere?",
        "Buzz: You're such a cynical bunny! Come on, the family that hops together stays together. Can't wait for mama bunny to get here.",
        "Coop: You know she can have my ears? How about that? We can give her my ears. Isn't that right, Emma?",
        "Buzz: Come here for a second. We're reading a book about bunnies. Emma got sad because she doesn't have a daddy bunny.",
        "Coop: Oh. I got it. I take it you're trying to fix that?",
        "Buzz: I hope so.",
        "Coop: Okay. Well, I then take it that the proposal is still on?",
        "Buzz: If you brought the ring.",
        "Coop: Yeah, I got the ring. It's right here. And, by the way, it's thawing out. You couldn't think of a better place to put it than the ice machine?",
        "Buzz: I don't usually have to hide expensive jewelry, you know.",
        "Coop: Yeah, well... so when is this magical moment going happen?",
        "Buzz: The minute I see Olivia.",
        "Coop: Great. Where is she?",
        "Buzz: That would be the question, wouldn't it be?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Buy you a drink?",
        "Ava: Is there a place in this town that someone can go to for a little privacy? I'm here because I don't want to see anyone.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, especially not me. Listen, I'll make it quick. I'm here to talk to you about your... the man that fathered you. At the very least, I owe you a character history. You need to know who he is, Ava.",
        "Ava: I already know.",
        "Olivia: And what do you know?",
        "Ava: That Jeffrey O'Neill is a scumbag. White wine, please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doris: You're 22 minutes late. Do I have to remind you that I'm your boss?",
        "Jeffrey: Mayor, D.A.",
        "Doris: Hmm. You know what, you're only mayor temporarily until Blake Marler recovers or you ruin your own career if you haven't done so already.",
        "Jeffrey: What are you talking about?",
        "Doris: You know, a reporter just called me to comment on an altercation between you and an unidentified woman.",
        "Jeffrey: It was not an altercation.",
        "Doris: Yeah, you're right. When an Assistant District Attorney attacks a woman, it's a scandal.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, look. Olivia Spencer and I had a private disagreement.",
        "Doris: Private. You were arrested.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, the police overreacted. There were no charges even filed.",
        "Doris: You know what, you don't need charges brought against you to lose the public's trust-- or mine, for that matter. You know what, you have been focused on this campaign for weeks-- neglecting your case load, and now you embarrass me.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, I'm so sorry, Doris. Did I embarrass you? You might have to suspend me now.",
        "Doris: You know what?",
        "Jeffrey: You know what, forget it, because you can't suspend me because I quit.",
        "Doris: Excuse me.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, you heard me. I quit. See, I have to worry about my future now as mayor.",
        "Doris: Oh, please.",
        "Aide: Mayor O'Neill, have you seen this?",
        "Jeffrey: Mayor O'Neill.",
        "Doris: Nice photo, Mr. Mayor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Hi.",
        "Billy: Reva. What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Reva: Well, you know, I just had a run-in with Alan, and um... he's on a war path again. He's got the drums beating and all because he found out that Jonathan and Lizzie are living with me. And normally I could fight him, but I'm having a hard enough time fighting to get myself up a flight of stairs. Please... please tell me you are not drinking, that this is not yours.",
        "Woman: Actually, it's mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: What have you got there, huh?",
        "Cassie: Hey, you. I thought you were at a meeting.",
        "Josh: Well, it finished early. What are you working on?",
        "Cassie: Oh, a list of people to invite for Thanksgiving.",
        "Josh: I see. It looks like you crossed everyone out.",
        "Cassie: You noticed that, have you?",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, well, I keep trying, but I can't come up with a seating arrangement that works. For example, let's say we invite Reva, right?",
        "Josh: Right.",
        "Cassie: Which would be awkward, but we can't not invite her.",
        "Josh: No, we can't not.",
        "Cassie: Right. So then she'll want Jonathan and Lizzie there, which then, of course, makes it torture for Tammy. And then there's your brother...",
        "Josh: Well, Billy and I, you know we'll work things out.",
        "Cassie: Hello? Reva basically told him to take a hike. I don't think she's going to want to have him there at the table. I don't think he's going to be there and say, \"Hey, would you please pass me a drumstick?\"",
        "Josh: Unless of course, he can hit her with it.",
        "Cassie: Now, that would be great.",
        "Josh: So, what exactly is your situation?",
        "Cassie: Well, the way I see it, there is only one way out of this.",
        "Josh: Thank you. And that would be what?",
        "Cassie: We cancel Thanksgiving this year.",
        "Josh: ( Laughing ) Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: \"Jeffrey O'Neill has a violent streak, especially around women.\" I'm going to sue, Doris.",
        "Doris: Hmm. You do that... after you clean out your desk before the end of the day.",
        "Jeffrey: \"This isn't the first time that Mr. O'Neill has been in trouble with the authorities. Sources say he's abused...\" this is outrageous. It makes me sound like some kind of a wife beater.",
        "Aide: We've been flooded with calls day. The press, several women's organizations. They all want to know what happened between you and the unidentified woman at the Beacon.",
        "Jeffrey: What they need to know is what did not happen.",
        "Aide: Should I set up a press conference?",
        "Jeffrey: Damn. Damn it.",
        "Aide: Maybe Blake Marler will recover and then you'll be off the hook.",
        "Jeffrey: Off the hook for what? For what? This is all gossip. We need to do some damage control.",
        "Aide: But this kind of story doesn't disappear. It hints at all kinds of indiscretions in your past. The people want answers.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, they want the real story, then that's what we'll give them. Only we're going to make sure that they hear my version first.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Thanks.",
        "Olivia: Don't ever say that mommy dearest never gave you anything. Listen, I don't care, you know.",
        "Ava: Good, I'm glad. Care about what?",
        "Olivia: Jeffrey O'Neill. Don't... don't lie to me. Okay, mommy didn't want you, so you're striking back through daddy.",
        "Ava: I told you Jeffrey is a creep.",
        "Olivia: And I don't believe that. I know you want to know him. He's going to convince you that this whole thing was somebody else's fault, that he's the victim.",
        "Ava: Can you say paranoid?",
        "Olivia: I saw you in the police station, helping him to his feet, dusting off his lapels. The only thing you didn't do was kiss him, Ava. And trust me, if you had, he probably would have forgotten you're his daughter.",
        "Ava: When I found out that Jeffrey O'Neill was my father, I did a little research. I know what he did to Danny Santos and Beth and Cassie. When Jeffrey O'Neill wants something, he goes for it and to hell with everyone else. I understand: My father is as miserable a person as my mother. And biologically, I'm screwed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: We're hopping on the couch. Here we go. This is a lot of fun. A little tiring, but fun nonetheless. There go the ears. I don't know how she does this. Does she run out of energy?",
        "Buzz: ( Laughs )",
        "Coop: I need to go to the gym. I'm running out of energy.",
        "Buzz: We're going to hop together again. Next I'm going to have Frank and Marina.",
        "Coop: Oh, I'll buy a ticket to that, I'll tell you that.",
        "Buzz: Because, you see, when you get me, you get the whole family. You got Coop now...",
        "Coop: That's Brother Bunny to you...",
        "Buzz: ...And then Frank and Marina and Gus and Harley. That's more bunnies than you have in your book, you know.",
        "Coop: And, you know what, I got to tell you, Dad, I think you've already got her in your corner. I think you're safe.",
        "Buzz: Yeah? ( Knock on door ) That's got to be Molly. That's her new babysitter. She's so hot, too bad you're taken. Molly, hi!",
        "Molly: Hi, Mr. Cooper, nice ears.",
        "Buzz: Right. Look, Emma, you're going to go to the park, okay? You can go to the park and have some fun. She likes the small swings and the small slide, not the big slide. She's going to ask for the big slide, but it scares her.",
        "Molly: Yeah, Jane mentioned that when I talked to her.",
        "Buzz: Give me your arms. Now, you going to buy Molly some ice cream? You going to buy her some ice cream? Here we go, you can buy her some ice cream. She likes chocolate. Half of it ends up on her shirt because she dribbles. You dribble, don't you? You dribble.",
        "Emma: I do not.",
        "Buzz: You do too. You do too dribble. Now scram. Go have some fun. Straighten up your ears.",
        "Coop: Oh, thanks. You know, seeing Emma just reminds me of when I used to be her age.",
        "Buzz: What?",
        "Coop: Do you remember when you used to take me on the motorcycle rides and mom used to tell you not to, but you would anyways?",
        "Buzz: Well, not for Emma. And your mother was right.",
        "Coop: Well, if you did, I'm sure Olivia would probably kill you.",
        "Buzz: After she cut off my fingers and toes, she'd kill me.",
        "Coop: Yeah, well. Help me with this. I've got to tell you, you are a pretty brave man. If I were you, I would probably wait until Olivia is in a better mood to do this.",
        "Buzz: How do you know what kind of mood Olivia is in?",
        "Coop: Dad, Olivia just found out that Jeffrey O'Neill's Ava's father.",
        "Buzz: Father? Took advantage of her, abandoned her. Doesn't deserve the name.",
        "Coop: Okay, well, look, all I'm trying to say here then is that you could probably wait for a better time before you get down on your knee and you ask, \"Will you marry me?\"",
        "Buzz: The idea is for better or for worse. This is worse. These are bad times; I want her to know she can count on me.",
        "Coop: Wow, quite the opportunist.",
        "Buzz: You know, she tells me no one ever sticks around in her life. You know me, I never stuck around in my life. This time I want her to know I'm not going anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Mine's water. Hey, I was just telling Reva that she had introduced us at her going-away party.",
        "Reva: Yeah, I'm really sorry. That whole night was such a blur. I didn't place you.",
        "Sheila: I'm the party crasher, right, cowboy?",
        "Billy: That's right, sugar.",
        "Sheila: You were right, Billy is an excellent tour guide. So, I'll see you downstairs?",
        "Billy: Yeah. Here, I'll help you out with your coat. Definitely see you downstairs. Here you go.",
        "Sheila: Thank you. It was nice seeing you again.",
        "Reva: You, too, Sheila.",
        "Billy: So?",
        "Reva: So... I just... I think that's great. I do. It's just a little odd because we've spent so much time together.",
        "Billy: You probably figured that I was going to hang around here waiting for you, looking at some bottle, right?",
        "Reva: No, no, no.",
        "Billy: But you've come here for my help, then?",
        "Reva: Yes. Because Alan now has taken it upon himself to go after Jonathan's baby, and I just, you know... normally I could battle him myself, but I just was hoping that...",
        "Billy: Wait, wait. What happened to not being so dependent upon me?",
        "Reva: Well, that was about us. This is about my unborn granddaughter.",
        "Billy: But you can't kick me out one minute and the next minute...",
        "Reva: Billy, come on. I didn't kick you out. I love you.",
        "Billy: Yeah, but not enough.",
        "Reva: Enough that I want you to have your own life. Billy, this... we're family, okay? Friends.",
        "Billy: Family? Friends?",
        "Reva: You're the best friend I've ever had in my life.",
        "Billy: Okay. Well, you've got to understand this, best friend: I didn't even realize how much I had fallen for you. My dreams had come true, and then all of a sudden it was over and my heart hurt. I need the distance.",
        "Reva: You don't want to see me?",
        "Billy: Not today. Not now. I think it's better you go.",
        "Reva: No.",
        "Billy: Reva...",
        "Reva: I'm not leaving.",
        "Billy: Yes, you are.",
        "Reva: Come on, Billy...",
        "Billy: No, please, go.",
        "Reva: I'll be back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: For a woman who wants to cancel Thanksgiving, you bought a lot of stuff.",
        "Cassie: All right, so I got a little carried away.",
        "Josh: Yeah, you sure did. Tell me about it, Pocahontas. This is lovely.",
        "Cassie: That is for R.J., thank you. But go ahead and make fun of me, because I want to make an authentic Thanksgiving celebration.",
        "Josh: Oh, I see, you want it to be authentic.",
        "Cassie: I do.",
        "Josh: Then we're going to have to throw out the turkey.",
        "Cassie: Why is that?",
        "Josh: Because they ate venison and salted fish, I think, on the first Thanksgiving.",
        "Cassie: They didn't eat turkey?",
        "Josh: No, the turkey came much later.",
        "Cassie: Okay, what about corn?",
        "Josh: They had corn, but they did not have apple pie. Oh, here, I'll show you one more thing here. Does this look familiar to you at all?",
        "Cassie: It looks like tic tac toe.",
        "Josh: Actually, it was called \"nut and crosses.\" I'll be crosses, and you, of course, can be nuts.",
        "Cassie: Now, I think you're already nuts.",
        "Josh: Guilty as charged.",
        "Cassie: Josh, this is our first real holiday together, and I was looking forward to it until I realized what a disaster it will be. I just... you and Reva always had everybody over.",
        "Josh: Cassie, we'll make our own traditions, okay? And besides that, no matter who comes over-- whether it's Jonathan or Lizzie or Roxy or whoever-- we all have one thing we can be thankful for, right? And that's that Reva is still with us.",
        "Cassie: That is true.",
        "Josh: Come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Okay. All I'm trying to say is that no one knows better than me how charming Jeffrey can be.",
        "Ava: What are you so afraid of? That he's going to tell me his side of the story and I'm going to believe him?",
        "Olivia: I would hope you'd be smarter than that.",
        "Ava: Well, I have a defective gene, remember?",
        "Olivia: I'm just actually trying to save you a lot of grief.",
        "Ava: Because you care about me so deeply?",
        "Olivia: I confronted Jeffrey. He refused any responsibility of that night. He is a con man, trust me.",
        "Ava: Wait a minute, what is that? Hey, hey, can you turn that up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: I'm sure most of you have seen this by now. \"Temp mayor arrested again.\" Filled with nothing but rumors and innuendo about my supposed dark past. During my campaign, I promised to deliver the truth, and that's what we are going to do. It's time to set the record straight.",
        "Buzz: Ten bucks it's a lie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: You ready to watch him lie?",

        "Billy: Hey, girls. Let's find you a seat over here and I'll do the receipts. Won't take too long, okay?",
        "Sheila: Okay. Hey, take your time. The local news will be one soon; I'll get to check the scores from last night's game.",
        "Billy: I can't believe I found a girl who actually understands football.",
        "Sheila: Hey, I don't just understand it, I like it.",
        "Billy: We're going to be watching the game this year together, even though we'll be rooting for different teams.",
        "Shelia: Well, you know, a little competition's good. It keeps things exciting.",
        "Billy: It does. Okay, I'm going to get you a drink. I'll be right back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Okay, so we got the 20- pound turkey, right? We're going to need ham. Thank you very much. Baked potatoes, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, green beans, enchiladas...",
        "Cassie: Enchiladas?",
        "Josh: Just making sure you're paying attention. And for dessert we're going to need apple pie, pumpkin pie, and, of course, Reva.",
        "Cassie: Reva?",
        "Reva: Hi.",
        "Josh: Hi.",
        "Cassie: Look at you all out on the town.",
        "Reva: Yeah, how about that? It's my doctor. He says I have to get out and walk 15 minutes every day. But the unique take on that is that the 15 minutes totally wears me out.",
        "Josh: Well, at least you're walking.",
        "Reva: At least I'm walking. I should probably go.",
        "Cassie: Actually, Reva, I wanted to ask you something.",
        "Reva: Sure, what?",
        "Cassie: Thanksgiving is coming up next week, and I was wondering if you would join us for dinner.",

        "Josh: So, what do you think? Do you want to join us at the farmhouse for Thanksgiving?",
        "Reva: Who else is invited?",
        "Cassie: We'll invite anyone else you want us to invite.",
        "Josh: And we'll also make sure that we have all of your favorites there, like Sarah's collard greens.",
        "Reva: Those were always your favorites.",
        "Josh: That's true, yes. So what do you think?",
        "Reva: Have you worked on the seating arrangements yet? Because it could be messy.",
        "Josh: Well, it's all messy, Reva. But the one thing that we're all thankful for is the fact that you're still with us. So say yes.",
        "Reva: I think I'm going to have to pass. I'm not ready to spend a holiday with you two as a couple just yet.",

        "Reva: Well, you gave it to me when I was dying, and so you should have it back.",
        "Cassie: No. It's yours. I gave it to you.",
        "Reva: But why?",
        "Cassie: Because I don't give something away and then ask for it back.",

        "Jeffrey: I was warned that once I took office that I would be attacked. I just didn't think it would come so soon and in such a vicious manner. I can assure you that the alleged incident at the Beacon was as harmless as the incident that this tabloid is speculating about from my past. No one was hurt now or in the past.",
        "Olivia: No one was hurt?",
        "Reporter: Mr. O'Neill, weren't the police involved at the Beacon?",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, they arrived, but no charges were filed. Of course, this newspaper-- and I use that term lightly-- neglected to mention that fact.",
        "Reporter: What about allegations you've have had problems with women before?",
        "Jeffrey: Ah, yes, problems with women. Well, what man has not had problems with a woman at some point? Many of you know I used to work for the government. What many of you do not know is that I was forced into service. As a teenager, I had several brushes with the law, and after one particular youthful indiscretion, I was led to believe by a certain government agency that I had committed a serious crime. Then they proposed to me that I either work for them or go to prison. I'm here to tell you today that my \"serious crime\" was nothing more than a wild, teenaged boy hooking up with a wild, teenaged girl.",

        "Jeffrey: So back to your question, did I abuse women in the past? No, of course not. Did I make some mistakes? Yes, absolutely. And I regret it. But I have more than paid my debt. I want nothing more now than to focus on becoming the best mayor I can possibly be.",
        "Buzz: Who said you paid your debt?",
        "Aide: I'm sorry, sir, we're only answering questions from the press.",

        "Reporter: Who is she? Can you give us a name?",

        "Aide: I'm sorry, but the mayor has a very important meeting downtown. Thank you all.",
        "Reporter: Can you at least give us the woman's name?",
        "Jeffrey: I cannot divulge that information, for her own protection, not mine. Now if you'll excuse me.",

        "Olivia: No, no, maybe somebody will shoot him.",

        "Olivia: I know. And he knows the whole story.",
        "Ava: Whole story... what, there's more? Tell me. I want to know.",
        "Olivia: When I found out that I was pregnant, it was really hard on my mother. We'd get into the usual stuff, you know, and we'd fight. But this time it was really bad. I had disgraced the family. I disappointed her. And I did what I usually do. I yelled at her, I said a lot of things that I regret, and she just stopped.",
        "Ava: She stopped?",
        "Olivia: She stopped. She had a stroke. She just stopped living. See, this is the thing: Jeffrey took away my innocence, but he also took my mother away from me, your grandmother.",

        "Josh: Really?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. This was your idea.",
        "Josh: No, actually, my idea was to invite the veterans over for Thanksgiving dinner, especially those who don't have family, and then you suddenly had the fever.",
        "Cassie: The fever?",
        "Josh: Yeah, the fever. That glazed look that women get when they suddenly actually believe they can be Martha Stewart.",
        "Cassie: I can be Martha Stewart. I can't help it. I'm excited. The more I think about it, your idea just seems really perfect to me.",
        "Josh: Well, it's not going to be perfect. Nothing is. But even if we can't be with our families, there's other people we can celebrate with and be thankful for.",

        "Josh: I'm thankful for you, too. ( Cell phone rings ) Excuse me. Oh, boy, here we go. Hi, Wanda. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Just stop, okay? Can we do this another time? Okay. No, I understand. Thanks, bye. There is a potential donor just passing through town. Wanda wants me to meet him at Towers right about now. You want to come with me?",
        "Cassie: Why don't you go ahead? I want to pick up a few more things.",

        "Aide: Well, as press conferences go, it was only about ten notches below \"I did not have sex with that woman.\"",
        "Jeffrey: Great. Only ten. I guess we're looking at single- digit approval ratings.",

        "Ava: I think I just want to go to sleep and close my eyes and see my real mother's face. I miss her so much right now.",
        "Coop: Good. Hold onto that. She was your real mother, you know.",
        "Ava: I know.",
        "Coop: You know it wasn't... it wasn't Olivia. She could be Mary Poppins, for all we know, and she still wasn't the one who changed your diapers when you were a little kid. She wasn't the one who put a band-aid on your knee when you needed it. And she certainly wasn't the one that tucked you in and said, \"Good night, sweet dreams, I love you.\" She certainly didn't scare the monsters away when they needed to be, either.",
        "Ava: You're a beautiful person, Henry Cooper Bradshaw.",
