        "Danny: Hi. \n\n",
        "Michelle: Hey. \n\n",
        "Danny: Hello to you, too. \n\n",
        "Michelle: (Protests) \n\n",
        "Danny: What? What? She's so tough. \n\n",
        "Ed: Are you going to begrudge your husband a\r\nFrench Fry? \n\n",
        "Danny: I know. Seriously. \n\n",
        "Michelle: We get a half hour break from the\r\nhospital. Every fry and every second counts. Sorry. \n\n",
        "Danny: Thank you, kind father-in-law. What\r\ncan I say? I worked up a real appetite looking for you over the hospital. Some\r\nnurse finally had to tell me where you were. \n\n",
        "Michelle: Why? What's going on? Everything\r\nokay? Robbie? \n\n",
        "Danny: Yeah, Robbie's fine. He's with Rick\r\nand Mel. I just wanted to, you know, stop by, say hello to my sexy wife. Catch\r\nup on all the latest gossip. \n\n",
        "Michelle: Right. Since when do you care about\r\nthe gossip? \n\n",
        "Danny: Well, you know, I was wondering if\r\nyou'd heard anything about the mayor. \n\n",
        "Ed: Only that he may not run for reelection. \n\n",
        "Danny: Oh, yeah. So you did hear something. \n\n",
        "Ed: Rumblings, you know? \n\n",
        "Michelle: Why am I the last person to find\r\nout about everything. \n\n",
        "Ed: No, no, the mayor's, you know, kept it\r\nunder wraps, so... \n\n",
        "Michelle: Well, I hope he reconsiders because\r\nall of your work on Fifth Street, we could use a friend in the office there,\r\nright? \n\n",
        "Danny: I'm sure I\u2019ll get along just fine\r\nwith the next mayor. \n\n",
        "Michelle: Why? Do you know someone who might\r\nbe running? \n\n",
        "Danny: Hmm... \n\n",
        "Michelle: Do you? \n\n",
        "Danny: Maybe. \n\n",
        "Michelle: Who? \n\n",
        "Danny: You're married to him. \n\n",

        "Marina: I just... I can't stop thinking about\r\nlast night. \n\n",
        "Shayne: Oh, and you laugh. Great. Thanks. \n\n",
        "Marina: No, no. No. I don't know. It's\r\njust... I don't feel like I\u2019m any different, but I know that I am. Do you know\r\nwhat I mean? Anyway, it was amazing, and you were amazing. \n\n",
        "Shayne: You, too. Aren't you supposed to be\r\nstudying... \n\n",
        "Marina: Oh. I get it. Someone's in a mood.\r\nNo, I'm kidding, I\u2019m kidding. I know you have to be tired. I'll go, I\u2019ll let\r\nyou get some rest. \n\n",
        "Shayne: Therapy. Therapy. \n\n",
        "Marina: Now? \n\n",
        "Shayne: Remy's coming in ten minutes. \n\n",
        "Marina: Okay. Well, you know, whatever you\r\nsay. Oh! I almost forgot. I picked us up a toy at the mall. Sort of like our own\r\nprivate intercom system. Breaker, breaker, breaker, one, nine, this is Big Red\r\nto Fast Ball. Can you read me? \n\n",
        "Shayne: Big Red? \n\n",
        "Marina: It's all about the hair, Shayne.\r\nAnyway, I'll leave this one on for you. Give me a shout out if you need\r\nanything. Okay, um... This extra therapy session isn't about us, is it? I mean\r\nit, Shayne. I could not have asked for anything more special for my first time.\r\nBye. \n\n",

        "Gus: I couldn't cut you loose, Phillip. All\r\nright? Alan. What are you doing home? \n\n",
        "Alan: Well, I do live here. \n\n",
        "Gus: Yeah, no, I know, but Thomas said that\r\nyou were out. \n\n",
        "Alan: I was out, but I'm back now. What's...\r\nWhat's going on? Gus? \n\n",
        "Gus: We caught Phillip breaking into a\r\nwoman's apartment tonight. \n\n",
        "Alan: What? \n\n",
        "Phillip: I thought it was Olivia. I made a\r\nmistake! \n\n",
        "Gus: We have convinced the woman not to press\r\ncharges. \n\n",
        "Fantasy Daughter: Hey, Dad. You miss me? Over\r\nhere. \n\n",
        "Alan: Phillip, where are you going? \n\n",
        "Phillip: Where...? \n\n",
        "Fantasy Daughter: You're not looking very\r\nhard, Dad. \n\n",
        "Gus: Is something the matter, Phillip? Is\r\nthere something out there? \n\n",
        "Phillip: Would you stop distracting me? \n\n",
        "Gus: Distracting you from what? \n\n",
        "Phillip: Nothing. It's nothing. \n\n",
        "Fantasy Daughter: (Laughing) \n\n",

        "Marina: Hey, Mom. It's me. Are you there?\r\nHello? All right, I guess you're not home. Sunday phone call. Don't panic. I'm\r\nfine. (Laughs) I'm actually great. Yeah, I don't know, I guess I just have a\r\nlot of stuff going on right now and I wanted to talk, but it's nothing bad, so\r\ndon't worry. All right. I guess, just give me a call when you get this. I miss\r\nyou. \n\n",
        "Remy: Are you okay? I have to go help Shayne.\r\n\n\n",
        "Darci: Yeah, thanks Remy. Hi. \n\n",
        "Marina: Hi. \n\n",
        "Darci: So, I told Buzz that I was going to be\r\nin the neighborhood and he gave me some of everyone's goodies. Their faves.\r\nSo... \n\n",
        "Marina: Thank you. \n\n",
        "Darci: You're welcome. I just stopped by\r\nbecause I wanted to see how you were doing, say hi. \n\n",
        "Marina: Hi. \n\n",
        "Darci: Hi. \n\n",
        "Marina: Hi. (Laughter) \n\n",
        "Darci: You know, Marina, I realize I'm not\r\nyour mom, and I\u2019m not trying to be, but I can be a good listener, too-- if you\r\nneed it. \n\n",
        "*\u00a0\u00a0\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 *\n\n",
        "Alan: Phillip, help me understand something:\r\nYou catch a glimpse of a pregnant woman that you think is Olivia, you stalk her\r\nand then break into her home. \n\n",
        "Phillip: Look, I didn't mean to scare\r\nanybody. I apologized to her, didn't I? \n\n",
        "Fantasy Daughter: You are always apologizing.\r\n\n\n",
        "Phillip: What? \n\n",
        "Gus: I didn't say anything. \n\n",
        "Fantasy Daughter: I keep waiting for you to\r\nfind me, Dad. You are so bad at this. \n\n",
        "Phillip: I'm trying. \n\n",
        "Alan: You're trying what, Phillip? \n\n",
        "Phillip: I'm... I'm... I'm trying to explain\r\nto you that this whole thing with this woman was just a misunderstanding. \n\n",
        "Gus: We're just trying to help you, Phillip. \n\n",
        "Alan: You know, Phillip, Dr. Langham did some\r\nincredible work with Elizabeth... \n\n",
        "Phillip: Oh, you know, I don't need therapy.\r\nI need to find Olivia. \n\n",
        "Fantasy Daughter: Enough about Mom! What\r\nabout me? You missed my first steps, my first day of school, the Father-Daughter\r\nPicnic. That was a real bummer. \n\n",
        "Phillip: I have been looking. \n\n",
        "Gus: I don't think that Olivia wants to be\r\nfound, Phillip. \n\n",
        "Alan: You know, Phillip, maybe we should get\r\nout of the house, change scenery, maybe go to Towers-- all three of us-- have\r\nsome dinner, some wine together. That might help. \n\n",
        "Fantasy Daughter: You're not looking hard\r\nenough. I'm leaving. \n\n",
        "Phillip: No. \n\n",
        "Alan: Well, I think it would be a good idea.\r\nAre you expecting someone? \n\n",
        "Phillip: My daughter. \n\n",
        "Gus: Lizzie? \n\n",
        "Phillip: Okay. Let's have dinner. I have to\r\ngo. \n\n",
        "Gus: Wait, wait, wait. Where are you going? \n\n",
        "Phillip: I need to... I need to see Lizzie. \n\n",
        "Alan: Lizzie is rehearsing her school play.\r\nShe'll be back a little later and you can see her. \n\n",
        "Phillip: Where is she rehearsing? \n\n",
        "Alan: She's at Company with Tammy, but I\r\ndon't think that you should leave, Phillip. I think... \n\n",
        "Phillip: Um, I just... I need to see... I can\r\nleave the house, can't I, Detective? \n\n",
        "Gus: Well, I can't stop you, Phillip, but\r\nmaybe he's right. Just take it easy. \n\n",
        "Phillip: No, I'm fine. I'm fine. I just need\r\nto see Lizzie. \n\n",
        "Alan: Phillip, I don\u2019t... \n\n",

        "Lizzie: \"I am the drudge and toil in\r\nyour delight, but you shall bear the burden soon at night. Go. I'll to dinner.\r\nHie you to the cell.\" \n\n",
        "Tammy: \"Hie to high fortune. Honest\r\nnurse, farewell.\" That scene went really well. \n\n",
        "Lizzie: Well, I can act, Tammy. \n\n",
        "Tammy: Oh, no, Lizzie. I mean, you're great.\r\nI just didn't know how into this you would be. \n\n",
        "Lizzie: Because I didn't get Juliet? No, it's\r\nokay. My therapist said I should be honest about the way that I feel, so I will\r\nlay it out for you. I was a little upset when you got the role of Juliet,\r\nbecause I wanted it. But, I mean, the nurse is cool, I guess, and you're my\r\nfriend, so I should happy for you, right? \n\n",
        "Tammy: Right... \n\n",
        "Lizzie: Therefore, I'm happy. Everything's\r\ngoing great for you. \n\n",
        "Tammy: What do you mean,\r\n\"everything\"? \n\n",
        "Lizzie: Let's see: You've got the lead in the\r\nplay, you've got a great boyfriend, you're finally getting along with your mom's\r\nboyfriend. Girls would kill to have your life. Don't worry, I\u2019m not one of\r\nthem. \n\n",
        "Tammy: I... I didn\u2019t... \n\n",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, you did. (Laughs) \n\n",
        "Tammy: Well, I guess I am pretty lucky. I\r\nmean, I'm psyched about the play and Joey\u2019s really fun. \n\n",
        "Lizzie: And if there's a \"but\" at\r\nthe end of that sentence... \n\n",
        "Tammy: But it's all kids' stuff. I mean,\r\nschool play and hooking up with my boyfriend. \n\n",
        "Lizzie: Um, yeah, it is kids' stuff. Because\r\nwe are kids. \n\n",
        "Joey: What up, Juliet? \n\n",
        "*\u00a0\u00a0\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 *\n\n",
        "Michelle: So, you're thinking about running\r\nfor the mayor of Springfield. Huh. \n\n",
        "Danny: Now, I have to admit, when Bill first\r\nbrought up the idea, I was skeptical, too. \n\n",
        "Michelle: Whoa, wait. Bill suggested this?\r\nOkay, Dad, can you just pinch me now? \n\n",
        "Danny: I know what you both are thinking, but\r\nthe more Bill and I talked about it, the better it started to sound. I have been\r\ngiving back a lot to the community through the Fifth Street Project. And public\r\noffice might just be the next logical step. \n\n",
        "Michelle: So, this Fifth Street Project is\r\nwhat inspired you to do this? \n\n",
        "Danny: Mm-hmm. \n\n",
        "Michelle: So, is Cassie going to make a play\r\nfor governor, and hey, Tony could become president. (Laughs) I'm sorry, but it\r\njust seems a little crazy, right? \n\n",
        "Danny: What? What's crazy about it? I want to\r\ndo some good things for this town. I want Robbie to grow up and be proud of his\r\nfamily name. You know I can do it. \n\n",
        "Michelle: Yeah, but I\u2019m just thinking about\r\nall the other things that we have to factor into this decision. All the\r\nquestions. \n\n",
        "Danny: Like what? Who's going to turn over\r\ntheir town to a former mob boss? \n\n",
        "Michelle: (Sighs) Danny, things have just\r\nsettled down for us. I mean, if you run for office, we're going to be under a\r\nmagnifying glass every single day. \n\n",
        "Danny: Michelle... \n\n",
        "Michelle: You're going to be the biggest\r\nstory in town. \n\n",
        "Danny: Michelle, I'm used to making\r\nheadlines. Granted, maybe not always for the right reasons, but I can deal with\r\nbeing watched and whispered about. I guess the question is, can you? Because\r\nyour whole family will be dragged into the media circus, too. \n\n",
        "Michelle: Springfield would be lucky to have\r\nyou as its mayor. So, what do you think, Dad? My husband, the mayor. (Laughs) \n\n",
        "Ed: I think it's the worst idea I\u2019ve ever\r\nheard. \n\n",
        "Danny: Ed, I understand your concern. Believe\r\nme, I know that this town is going to want to rip me apart for the crimes I\r\ncommitted under Carmen up to the parking ticket I got last week-- sorry, honey.\r\nBut I don't know what else to tell you, except I can't hide from my past. No one\r\ncan. \n\n",
        "Michelle: All right, look. We have nothing to\r\nhide anyway, anymore. I mean, so we have nothing to fear, and Danny and I will\r\njust face the truth head-on. \n\n",
        "Ed: (Laughs bitterly) And what about the\r\nrest of us? \n\n",
        "Michelle: Well, you're right. You're right,\r\nthe public will dig up every buried secret they can find. But, Dad, your\r\ndrinking was never really a secret, and I mean, you've been sober for a really\r\nlong time. \n\n",
        "Ed: What about Robbie? He's going to be\r\nsurrounded by rumors and, like you say, whispers. \n\n",
        "Michelle: Well, we'll just... We'll tell\r\nRobbie the truth. People make mistakes and we can overcome them and become\r\nbetter people. You've done it, Dad. And Danny has, too. \n\n",
        "Danny: I'm still trying. I'm still trying. I\r\nmean, I guess that's the whole reason for this. I can't undo the things that my\r\nmother did, but I can help this town to heal. \n\n",
        "Michelle: And you will. You will. I know you\r\nwill. So? \n\n",
        "Ed: You know you have my vote. \n\n",
        "*\u00a0\u00a0\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 *\n\n",
        "Marina: Oh, I\u2019m sure you have more\r\nimportant things to do than listen to me ramble. (Laughs) \n\n",
        "Darci: Well, actually you're in luck. Today I\r\nhave nothing more to do. So... \n\n",
        "Marina: Oh. \n\n",
        "Darci: You know, it's okay, Marina. You don't\r\nhave to talk to me if it's uncomfortable for you. \n\n",
        "Marina: No. No, no, no, no, no. \n\n",
        "Darci: Whatever it is... \n\n",
        "Marina: That's not it. That's not it. It's\r\njust... (Sighs) \"whatever it is\" is not something I'm even really\r\nsure I\u2019m ready to talk to my mom about, so it's... \n\n",
        "Darci: Oh. Okay. \n\n",
        "Marina: What is... What is... What is the\r\n\"oh.\" What do you mean by that \"oh\"? \n\n",
        "Darci: Well, let's just say that if you do\r\ndecide you want to talk about it-- and I think you should talk about it with\r\nsomeone-- I'm here and I\u2019ll listen. I can tell you're not really into it, and\r\nI don't blame you. I mean, it's uncomfortable. Your dad's girlfriend, sex talk.\r\n(Shudders) So I\u2019ll just let you get back to your studying. \n\n",
        "Marina: Okay, uh, I didn't say that I\r\nwanted... Could you tell? \n\n",
        "Darci: That you wanted to talk about it? \n\n",
        "Marina: I mean, when you walked in, could you\r\ntell? Do I look different? \n\n",
        "Darci: You mean you've already, uh... \n\n",
        "Marina: Yeah. Um, last night. It was my first\r\ntime. \n\n",
        "Darci: Oh. Wow. Uh, okay. \n\n",
        "Marina: So, do I look different? \n\n",
        "Darci: Well, do you feel different, honey? \n\n",
        "Marina: I mean, I feel happy. I feel really\r\nhappy. \n\n",
        "Darci: Good. Good. That's exactly how you\r\nshould feel. \n\n",
        "Marina: I mean, I don't know. It's just so\r\nweird, you know, because I guess I always thought that there was this kind of\r\nline between, like, the people who had and the people who hadn't, and then now\r\nthat I've crossed that line, it's just... It's not the way that I thought it\r\nwould be. \n\n",
        "Darci: How do you mean? \n\n",
        "Marina: I mean, I don't know. And it's not\r\nbecause of Shayne's condition, it's just... It's just not how I imagined it. \n\n",
        "Darci: Better? Or worse? \n\n",
        "Marina: It's better. Much better. I just feel\r\nso close to Shayne right now. \n\n",
        "Darci: Yeah, but... You're worried that the\r\nchange is... Is going to change in ways that you haven't even figured out yet,\r\nhuh? It will. But that's absolutely normal, especially when it's something as\r\nimportant as your first time. \n\n",
        "Marina: Yeah, but everything has been so\r\ngreat with Shayne and I and I don't want anything to change. \n\n",
        "Darci: Well, change isn't always necessarily\r\na bad thing, Marina. I mean, trust me. If Shayne is the right guy for you... \n\n",
        "Marina: And he is. \n\n",
        "Darci: And you two really do love each\r\nother... \n\n",
        "Marina: We really do. \n\n",
        "Darci: Then this kind of change can only make\r\nthings better for you two. \n\n",

        "Shayne: What? \n\n",
        "Remy: I said you rock! Now keep up that\r\nintensity. Let's go. One, good. Come on. Two, good. Come on, keep going. Keep\r\npushing. Three, good. \n\n",

And I'm telling you,\r\nyou can only hide behind a smile for so long, honey, before everything will come\r\ncrashing down on you.

I hate that every time I look out the window, one of you are in the\r\ncar, waiting to save me from my own self. Dad, today it's Thomas. Maybe next\r\nweek it'll be Mom or Grandpa. \n\n",

        "Lizzie: And that's another thing! I hate the\r\nway everybody says that they love me in this weird, cheery voice like there's\r\nsomeone with a straight-jacket just waiting for me. Okay? Everybody in this town\r\nexpects me to do something terrible, so why should I disappoint them? Aren't you\r\njust so glad you asked? \n\n",
