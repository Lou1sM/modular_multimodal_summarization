        "Rick: Yes. \r\n",
        "Harley: Wow. \r\n",
        "Rick: Yes. \r\n",
        "Harley: I guess you guys really didn't sleep too well last night, huh?\r\n\r\n",
        "Rick: Well, that tends to happen when there aren't enough blankets and\r\n\r\npillow to go around. \r\n",
        "Harley: Yeah. \r\n",
        "Phillip: Or beds. \r\n",
        "Buzz: And too many people show up uninvited. \r\n",
        "Phillip: I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. \r\n",
        "Rick: All right, fine. Fine. If you can fold as well as you snore...\r\n\r\n",
        "Phillip: Did you have the nerve to say I was snoring? You snored all \r\nnight. \r\n",
        "Harley: Well, how could somebody be snoring if nobody was sleeping? \r\nSorry. I slept great. \r\n",
        "Rick: Oh, wonderful. Holly and Beth didn't seem to have any problems,\r\n\r\neither. ",
        "",
        "Phillip: No, because they were in beds, in bedrooms. \r\n",
        "Buzz: Ah, watch it! \r\n",
        "Harley: Hey, the kids are sleeping. \r\n",
        "Buzz: I sleep here-- not really-- tossing and turning on the floor all \r\nnight, \r\nalone. First thing in the morning, Holly decides to take a walk around the lake.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing like a house full of folks to make a romantic getaway go \r\naway. ",
        "",
        "Lizzie: Mom, but I need it. \r\n",
        "Lorelei: Okay, uh, sweetie, I will look for your sweater just as soon \r\nas I \r\nfind James' blanky. \r\n",
        "Harley: Well, a little boy needs his blanky. Did you check the car? \r\n",
        "Lorelei: Hmm? \r\n",
        "Harley: The car. \r\n",
        "Rick: If it's not here, it's got to be out in the car. \r\n",
        "Phillip: Actually, I think I remember seeing it in the car. \r\n",
        "Lorelei: You're right, you're right. It's in the car. I'll go get it.\r\n\r\n",
        "Buzz: Ooh, the blanky's in the car. \r\n",
        "Lorelei: You're still here? ",
        "",
        "Edmund: Am I? I can't feel a thing. \r\n",
        "Lorelei: That's James' blanky. He wants it. (Laughs) \r\n",
        "Edmund: And he can have it, too. It barely covered my shoulders, let \r\nalone \r\nkept me warm at night. \r\n",
        "Lorelei: You were here all night? \r\n",
        "Edmund: Yes. Freezing. Trying desperately to figure out how, of all \r\nthings, you came up with the idea of strip poker. \r\n",
        "Lorelei: How'd you know about that? \r\n",
        "Edmund: The cabin has windows and I have eyes. Are you purposely \r\ntrying to ruin all of our plans, destroy any hope we have of getting hold of \r\nPhillip's money? Because strip poker's a damn good way of doing it. \r\n",
        "Lorelei: Relax, Eddie. I'm great at cards, you know that. \r\n",
        "Edmund: That's not the point and you know it. Beth would never play a\r\n\r\ngame so vulgar. \r\n",
        "Lorelei: You're jealous. \r\n",
        "Edmund: What? \r\n",
        "Lorelei: You are. That's why you were spying on me last night. \r\n",
        "Edmund: Oh, don't be ridiculous. I simply don't want you to squander a\r\n\r\nmagnificent opportunity to take Phillip Spaulding for all he's worth. \r\n",
        "Lorelei: You like being around me. That's the real reason you hid out \r\nin \r\nthe trunk of the car, isn't it? Hmm? \r\n",
        "Edmund: Is it possible to be this vain? I did it because I didn't trust \r\nyou not \r\nto bungle what I've worked so hard to set in motion. \r\n",
        "Lorelei: No. It means you care about me, Eddie. For real. (Laughs)\r\n",
        "",
        "Marah: Would you study this a minute? \r\n",
        "Catalina: What? Big news on campus? \r\n",
        "Marah: Yeah. Me. It wasn't enough that the whole school got spammed \r\nwith my essay on e-mail, but now it's in the newspaper, too. \r\n",
        "Catalina: I'm sorry. \r\n",
        "Marah: Because it happened or because you made it happen? \r\n",
        "Catalina: Look, Marah, it says here that they admire you for your \r\nhonesty. \r\n",
        "Marah: What I wrote was supposed to be private. I know you did this to\r\n\r\nme. \r\n",
        "Catalina: Oh, come on, Marah. I somehow got this to everybody in \r\nschool? \r\nOn purpose? No. \r\n",
        "Marah: Well, it must have been an accident, then. \r\n",
        "Catalina: I have work to do. \r\n",
        "Marah: No, your work is already done. You made sure that I'd be the \r\nbiggest joke going on this school, right? That was your idea, wasn't it? To \r\nmake me look bad, especially to Tony, just so that you'd look a whole lot \r\nbetter. \r\n",
        "Catalina: You know, would you just quit crying to me about this? I \r\nthought \r\nyou were proud. \r\n",
        "Marah: Proud? Proud that the most private stuff I've ever written in my \r\nlife \r\nwas broadcast to the entire school? I don't think so. \r\n",
        "Catalina: Okay, come on, Marah. Admit it. You probably love all this\r\n\r\nattention. You're the town's most famous virgin. \r\n",
        "Marah: And what does that make you? Its newest slut? \r\n",
        "Carmen: Carlos, Carlos, you worry too much. The money will come, be \r\npatient. That's a virtue, you know. Yes, well, for $25 million, it's worth the\r\n\r\nwait. Of course I know what's at stake. That's the whole point. So do Danny \r\nand Michelle. I've got them right where I want them. ",
        "",
        "Frank: Okay, so the sting operation with Mr. Big didn't pan out. At \r\nleast \r\nyou guys didn't get caught crawling around the Spaulding air ducts. \r\n",
        "Danny: We were so close to getting our hands on that $25 million, \r\nFrank. \r\n",
        "Michelle: But we got something better than the money. At least we \r\nthought we did. \r\n",
        "Frank: What are you referring to? Are you talking about the computer \r\ndisk \r\nwith the bank access codes on it? \r\n",
        "Danny: Yeah. Spaulding's offshore accounts would net a hell of a lot \r\nmore \r\nfor Mr. Big than $25 million. I thought there would be a chance that he would\r\n\r\ngo for the disk instead of the cash, but... \r\n",
        "Frank: Did Carlos say anything why he wouldn't? \r\n",
        "Danny: No, but he's obviously not stupid. Why would he take the risk\r\n\r\nhimself and do the dirty work when we can go into the offshore banks and \r\npull the money out ourselves. \r\n",
        "Michelle: And hand it right over to him. \r\n",
        "Danny: So... Well, we were close. I thought it was worth a shot. I had\r\n\r\nhoped he would go for the disk, but... \r\n",
        "Frank: Fine. Then fine. What do you do now? \r\n",
        "Danny: There's only one thing we can do. ",

        "",
        "Danny: Our only hope is to do what Mr. Big wants. \r\n",
        "Frank: Well, you're not talking about going offshore and getting the \r\nmoney \r\nyourselves. \r\n",
        "Danny: Frank, we have the access codes. We just need to figure out \r\nwhich \r\noffshore bank has the fattest Spaulding account-- it's probably the one in the\r\n\r\nCaymans-- go there ourselves and pull the money out. \r\n",
        "Michelle: But we don't bring it back. \r\n",
        "Frank: Oh, I see. So you plan on keeping it yourselves, do you? \r\n",
        "Michelle: No. \r\n",
        "Danny: Frank, we plan on contacting Mr. Big, telling him we have the\r\n\r\nmoney and then luring him to where we are. He'd feel a lot safer on a small \r\nisland than he would here, and when he shows up, we nail him. \r\n",
        "Frank: I see. So it's the same sting, but different location. \r\n",
        "Danny: Right. \r\n",
        "Frank: Not going to happen. \r\n",
        "Michelle: It could work. \r\n",
        "Frank: Forget it, Michelle. \r\n",
        "Danny: So, what? You're not going to help us? \r\n",
        "Frank: Well, how can I help you here? You're way out of my jurisdiction\r\n\r\nhere. You're talking about a little island that's 1,000 miles away. I mean, I\r\n\r\ncan't do it. I'm sorry. \r\n",
        "Danny: So we'd... we'd be on our own. \r\n",
        "Frank: That's exactly right. Not only would you be on your own, but you\r\n\r\nwould have no backup, you wouldn't have anybody there to arrest Mr. Big. \r\nYou're not talking about going there on a sting operation. You're talking about\r\n\r\na suicide mission.",

        "Lorelei: Just want to make sure I don't get too chummy with Phillip, \r\nhey, \r\nEddie? (Laughs) \r\n",
        "Edmund: There are millions of dollars at stake here, Lorelei. That's \r\nwhat \r\nI'm concerned about. \r\n",
        "Lorelei: Yeah? So, if you saw Phillip and I smooching it up something\r\n\r\nfierce, that wouldn't bother you? \r\n",
        "Edmund: It would bother anyone with a stomach, but not me. Not if it \r\ngot \r\nus closer to his money. \r\n",
        "Lorelei: Well, that's good, because, see, this car's going to be fixed \r\nsoon \r\nand then we're going to be on our way to that inn, and that ought to be real,\r\n\r\nreal cozy for Phillip and me. \r\n",
        "Edmund: Don't forget your blanky-bearing son and Lizzie. Don't forget\r\n\r\nthem. \r\n",
        "Lorelei: Oh, they go to bed early. And once they do, Phillip and I will \r\nhave \r\nplenty of time to... \r\n",
        "Edmund: All right, all right, all right. Look, look, look, I get the \r\npicture. \r\nJust go, then. Go. Go to your inn. I'll just hop in the trunk and go along for \r\nthe \r\nride. \r\n",
        "Lorelei: No. Two's a couple, three isn't. You're not coming with us, \r\nEddie. \r\n",

        "Lorelei: Can you believe it? I just found him. He hid in the trunk of \r\nthe car \r\nand just rode up here with us, like a piece of luggage. \r\n",

        "Harley: That we have way too many friends? And that we have really \r\nlousy luck. \r\n",

        "Harley: Yeah. Lots of layers helped, too. \r\n",
        "Rick: Yeah. Didn't help me-- at all. Well, I guess it's time for us to \r\nfind a \r\nplace where we can be alone. \r\n",
