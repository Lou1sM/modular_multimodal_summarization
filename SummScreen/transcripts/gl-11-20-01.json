        "Blake: Oh, Felicia, I'm so glad you got here so quickly.\r\n",
        "Felicia: When you called you sounded really upset.\r\n",
        "Blake: Yeah, well, I'm trying not to be. Succeeding admirably. Oh, \r\nhoney, \r\njust tell me I'm not crazy.\r\n",
        "Felicia: I'd prefer it if we didn't use that word.\r\n",
        "Blake: Okay, well, then, why am I being so obsessive and jealous? Tell \r\nme \r\nwhy I'm doing this. Tell me there's no good reason for it.\r\n",
        "Felicia: And this is all because Ross' assistant...\r\n",
        "Blake: Tory granger.\r\n",
        "Felicia: ...The young woman who lost her husband, you're upset because\r\n\r\nshe's throwing herself into her job?\r\n",
        "Blake: No. I'm upset because she's throwing herself at Ross. Look, hear \r\nme \r\nout. I had planned this romantic lunch with Ross, and just as things were \r\nstarting to heat up, who shows up at the restaurant? Tory-- same time, same \r\nrestaurant.\r\n",
        "Felicia: And what, alone?\r\n",
        "Blake: No, she was with this guy, Jeff. But listen, listen to this. It \r\nturns out \r\nthat the casting director calls me in the middle of my lunch and I have to run.\r\nBut lo and behold, so does Jeff. Coincidence? I mean, this is their first date.\r\nNot to sound paranoid...\r\n",
        "Felicia: But?\r\n",
        "Blake: But this knot in the middle of my stomach is telling me that she\r\n\r\nengineered this so she could take advantage of my exit and be alone with \r\nRoss.\r\n",
        "Felicia: Doesn't that strike you as just a little...\r\n",
        "Blake: Manipulative? Yes.\r\n",
        "Felicia: Convoluted?\r\n",
        "Blake: No. They spent the rest of the day together. Now, tell me I'm \r\ncrazy \r\nto think that this little law student is after Ross.",

        "Danny: What do you mean you asked my mother for help? Have you gone \r\nnuts?\r\n",
        "Michelle: Maybe. I'm desperate.\r\n",
        "Danny: Honey, it's suicidal. We have got... We are dealing with enough\r\n\r\nright now. We're putting our lives on the line for this Mr. Big.\r\n",
        "Michelle: Who may or may not be Carmen.\r\n",
        "Danny: Look, we don't have any proof it's her.\r\n",
        "Michelle: No, we don't, but this way we're going to know for sure.\r\n",
        "Danny: Honey...\r\n",
        "Michelle: We can handle her. And I don't care what I have to do or who \r\nI \r\nhave to align myself with. I'm not going to lose you.\r\n",
        "Danny: I don't want to lose you either, or Robbie, so why on earth \r\nwould \r\nyou even want to consider doing something like this?\r\n",
        "Michelle: Danny, I have a pretty good idea of what Carmen is capable \r\nof.\r\nBut with Mr. Big breathing down our necks, we've got to fight fire with fire.\r\n",
        "Danny: What did she say when you asked her?\r\n",
        "Michelle: Oh, you know, she wasn't really hot on the idea at first. But \r\nonce \r\nshe realized the danger you're in, she agreed.\r\n",
        "Danny: Oh, right. Honey, that's because there's a price attached to it. \r\nYou \r\nof all people should know that.\r\n",
        "Michelle: Well then I'll beat her at her own game. I have so far.\r\n",
        "Danny: So then why do you want to push your luck, our luck?\r\n",
        "Michelle: Because, Danny, it just makes sense if you think about it. \r\nNow \r\nwe have to go, actually.\r\n",
        "Danny: No. No, honey...\r\n",
        "Michelle: We have to go to lunch at towers: You, me, Robbie and Carmen.",

        "Ben: Since you and Marah can't stand each other, I figure...\r\n",
        "Catalina: Stop. Stop putting words in my mouth.\r\n",
        "Ben: I don't have to. It's obvious. Which makes me wonder, why do you\r\n\r\ncare if I go after her?\r\n",
        "Catalina: I don't. So knock yourself out and good luck. I hope \r\neverything \r\nworks out for you.\r\n",
        "Ben: Hey, thanks. It's awfully nice of you, I mean, considering we just\r\n\r\nmet, or is it? Because in my experience, when two gorgeous girls are at each \r\nother's throats, there's usually a man in the middle.",

        "Marah: I wish you had.\r\n",
        "Tony: Then why did you send it to me in the first place? Do you think \r\nyou \r\ncan just play games whenever it suits you?\r\n",
        "Marah: No.\r\n",
        "Tony: But I got to hand it to you, you know? It was some piece of work.\r\n\"Making love for the first time should be special. I'm so glad I didn't \r\nspend the \r\nnight with Tony.\" You know, why don't you tell me how you really feel, huh?\r\n",
        "Marah: Tony, please, will you just at least let me explain?\r\n",
        "Tony: Oh, no, you already did. But it would have been bad enough if you\r\n\r\nwould had just sent it to me, but no. You had to e-mail everybody on campus.\r\nYou're so damn proud about the way you feel, huh?\r\n",
        "Marah: Please, Tony. I never, ever meant to hurt you.\r\n",
        "Tony: What? What? You caused me pain? All right, you didn't. You're not\r\n\r\nthe only one who's glad we didn't sleep together. I'm even happier than you, \r\nand relieved, because it would have been just a huge mistake.",

        "Tony: What? What'd you think, huh? You think you're the only one that\r\n\r\nfelt that way? I'm so glad we didn't sleep together.\r\n",
        "Marah: Is that right?\r\n",
        "Tony: Yeah, it is, because it would have never lasted. What we had was\r\n\r\nnothing special.\r\n",
        "Marah: How can you look at me in the eyes and say that?\r\n",
        "Tony: Because it's true. You made that perfectly clear when you went\r\n\r\ncrying running into Sammy's arms, okay?\r\n",
        "Marah: Like you ran into Catalina's?\r\n",
        "Tony: Hey, what I have with Catalina is none of your business. She's\r\n\r\nsweet, she's good to me, and she knows what's private.\r\n",
        "Marah: She's really pulled the wool over your eyes.\r\n",
        "Tony: No, no Marah. You see, that's the difference between you and her.\r\nShe doesn't play games.\r\n",
        "Marah: I just hope that she doesn't hurt you, okay?\r\n",
        "Tony: Don't worry, she won't. I learn from my mistakes.\r\n",
        "Marah: Why are you trying so hard to hurt me?\r\n",
        "Tony: I'm not, okay? I'm just telling you how it is, just like you did \r\nto me, \r\nexcept this time I'm saying it to your face.\r\n",
        "Marah: Look, Tony, what happened with that essay, it was an accident,\r\n\r\nokay? I only wrote that for me. Nobody else was ever supposed to see it. I just\r\n\r\nwanted to work some things out.\r\n",
        "Tony: Well, bravo, baby, because you had the workout of the century. \r\nAnd \r\nyou know what? Since we're being so honest here, let me tell you something.\r\nWhen I was working for your old man? I felt ashamed of who I was, and I had \r\nnever felt like that in my life. And then I realized there's no reason for me to\r\n\r\napologize for who I am. If people can't accept me because my last name is \r\nSantos then that's their problem, and Catalina has helped me see that.\r\n",
        "Marah: Virtuous, noble Catalina, helping you to see what horrible, \r\nhorrible \r\npeople me and my family really are.\r\n",
        "Tony: Look, Catalina likes me for who I am. She's good to me, she's \r\nproud, okay? Because she sees me as one of the good guys, regardless of what \r\nyou think. So you know what? This is the way I see it. Okay, you're going to \r\nbe holding on to your virginity for a long time because there isn't a guy out\r\n\r\nthere who's good enough for you. (Sighs)",

        "Danny: Well, I don't know. Honestly, I don't what the hell is crazier: \r\nYou \r\nasking my mother for help or her agreeing to it.\r\n",

        "Danny: No, she's crazy, period.\r\n",
        "Michelle: And she's crazy about her grandson, too. I just played the \r\nfamily \r\ncard.\r\n",
        "Danny: Right, and that's never worked before, honey. Why do you think \r\nit \r\nwould work now?\r\n",
        "Michelle: Because maybe she is and maybe she isn't pulling the strings, \r\nbe \r\nwe can't afford to take any chances.\r\n",
        "Danny: Exactly. So why are you pushing your luck, our luck?\r\n",
        "Michelle: Because Danny, if we keep her close, we're going to find out\r\n\r\nwhether she's really involved or not. And if she isn't, she's got friends in \r\nhigh \r\nplaces, friends that we could use right now.\r\n",
