        "Jeffrey: Hi. I think we need to talk. Can I\r\ncome in? ",
        "Ava: Sure, Mr. O\u2019Neill. ",
        "Jeffrey: Mr. O\u2019Neill? ",
        "Ava: Would you like it better if I called\r\nyou daddy? ",
        "",
        "Olivia: Tell me again why you're so anxious\r\nto get coffee, especially since you look so... ",
        "Buzz: Anxious? We're not going to be one of\r\nthose couples that, like, read each other's mind and finishes sentences... ",
        "Olivia: No, because I have no idea what\r\nyou're thinking, what you're planning to say. ",
        "Buzz: Great, good, yes! ",
        "Olivia: I thought it's not a bad idea to get\r\nout. My life is a bit of a mess right now. I can't get Ava and Jeffrey out of\r\nmy head. ",
        "Buzz: Oh God, I'm so glad we're thinking the\r\nsame way. It\u2019s... ",
        "Olivia: What? ",
        "Buzz: It's going to be... I'm not here to\r\nactually get you a cup of coffee. ",
        "Olivia: Coffee and a cookie? ",
        "Buzz: Oh, better, I hope. ",
        "Olivia: Oh, goodie. Hold that thought.\r\nExcuse me, hi. Could I get my usual, a double decaf soy latte, no foam. Just hold the foam. Maybe a\r\nlittle cinnamon. Can I have some cookies? ",
        "",
        "Lizzie: Excuse me, coming through. Sorry,\r\nyou guys. ",
        "Beth: Well, I never thought that I would see\r\nthe day. ",
        "Lizzie: Well, that only sounds a little\r\nsnobby. ",
        "Beth: I'm not being snobby. ",
        "Lizzie: I'm just saying that you were a\r\nwaitress, too. ",
        "Beth: Yes, you're right, I was. But not while I was pregnant. You could be at home being\r\nwaited on hand and swollen feet. ",
        "Lizzie: My feet are not that swollen. ",
        "Beth: Oh, right. When I was pregnant with\r\nyou, every part of me was very swollen. ",
        "Lizzie: Well, I have never felt better in my\r\nlife. I love living with Jonathan and we can't wait for the baby to get here. ",
        "Beth: Okay, Lizzie. And\r\nthen what? ",
        "Lizzie: Can I get you something? ",
        "Beth: I just don't want to see you living in\r\nsome kind of fantasy world... ",
        "Lizzie: I'm not. ",
        "Beth: ... Where you and Jonathan\r\nand that baby become the perfect family. ",
        "Lizzie: Okay, you know something, if there\r\nis anything that granddad taught me, it's that family\r\nis what you make of it. Jonathan and I, we get each other. So we're going to\r\nhave something real, marriage and all. It's just going to take a little time. ",
        "",
        "Reporter: Ms. Winslow, just a question or\r\ntwo. ",
        "Tammy: I don't have anything to say about Jeffrey\r\nO\u2019Neill. ",
        "Reporter: Was Mr. O\u2019Neill violent when he\r\nlived with your mother? ",
        "Tammy: No. ",
        "Reporter: Rumor is he has a temper. ",
        "Tammy: I don't know, I don't know. I don't\r\nwant to talk to you. ",
        "Reporter: Is he, in fact, violent? ",
        "Tammy: I don't know... ",
        "Jonathan: Hey, you guys want violence? I'm\r\nabout to give you a face full, okay? Let me get you out of here. ",
        "",
        "Josh: You know what, maybe I just\r\nmisunderstood. I could have sworn that Wanda said that I was supposed to meet\r\nsomebody here at... ( laughs ) Wait a second, I think there's something going on. ",
        "Reva: Or somebody's up to something. ",
        "Josh: Yes, but who?\r\n",
        "Marah: Somebody who wanted to see both of\r\nyou. ",
        "Josh/Reva: Marah? ",
        "Marah: Surprise. ",
        "Reva: Honey. Oh, my God, it really is you. ",
        "Marah: It really is me. I came as fast as I\r\ncould. You look great, Mom. ",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, you know, the rumors about\r\nmy demise were greatly exaggerated. ",
        "Marah: And how many times have you gotten to\r\nsay that? ",
        "Reva: Too many. ",
        "Josh: Hello. ",
        "Marah: Hello. ",
        "Josh: Come here. So, why aren't you in Paris, sweetheart? ",
        "Marah: Are you kidding? I was freaked out on\r\nthe way over here. I was just terrified that... I just kept thinking about all\r\nthe great times that we've had as a family. It kept running through my head. I\r\nkept thinking, \"Will we ever do that again? Will we ever do this\r\nagain?\" Whatever. I'm here now, but most\r\nimportantly, you're here. ",
        "Reva: Fighting and clawing my way to stay. ",
        "Josh: Welcome home, darling. ",
        "Marah: It's so good to see you guys\r\ntogether. Like you're supposed to be. Springfield has not changed at all. ",
        "Josh: Oh, I wouldn't say that. ",
        "Marah: It hasn\u2019t. It feels like I just left.\r\n",
        "Reva: Well, you haven't been gone all that\r\nlong. ",
        "Josh: Long enough. ",
        "Marah: As soon as I stepped off the plane, I\r\njust got flooded with memories. I drove by the Beacon, where you guys got\r\nmarried, and I went by the house. ",
        "Reva: We're hardly ever there. ",
        "Marah: I know, but seeing the cabin all the\r\nway here from Cross Creek was... ",
        "Josh: Wait a minute, you saw the... do you\r\nstill have your keys? ",
        "Marah: Of course. I almost cried when I walked\r\nin. That place just has so much meaning for you guys as a couple, always on the\r\nmantel. ",
        "Reva: Honey, you do know what is going on\r\nbetween your daddy and me, the two of us, right? ",
        "Marah: Well, let's see. You hid the fact\r\nthat you had cancer, and you started shacking up with Aunt Cassie. Did I miss\r\nanything? ",
        "Josh: No, I don't think so. ",
        "Reva: I guess we do need to have a talk. ",
        "Marah: The truth is I think that I\r\nunderstand. It was hard at first, but then I started thinking about New York and what a great time we had. And part of me sees\r\nwhy you would want that to be the last memory we had of you. ",
        "Reva: Picturing you at my death bed was\r\njust... ",
        "Marah: I know, Momma, I know you wanted a\r\nhappier good-bye than that. ",
        "Reva: I just wanted us to remember how it\r\nwas with us. Nobody said you had to be there to hold my hand at my bedside. ",
        "Marah: Mom, just so you know, if we had to say good-bye like that, that would have been\r\nokay, too. We could have handled it. ",
        "Reva: I know, but why should you have to? ",
        "Marah: Because we love you. ",
        "Reva: I'm so sorry. I mean, I never meant to\r\nlie to you. ",
        "Marah: I hate that you did, but I get it. ",
        "Reva: Really? I mean the things that I put\r\nand your brothers through... ",
        "Marah: Yeah, Mom, but we know you love us. ",
        "Josh: She does, no\r\nquestion about that. We both do. ",
        "Marah: I'm sorry, Dad. But you're the one I\r\ndon't understand. ",
        "",
        "Lizzie: Can we go? It's about time I get\r\nhome. I don't want to be late. Jonathan worries. ",
        "Beth: Oh, right, he does, does he? ",
        "Lizzie: He cares. Whether you like it or\r\nnot, Jonathan cares. ",
        "Beth: Honey, I just want you to be happy. I\r\nwant you to be as happy as I was when you and your father and I were all in Arizona. ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, before everything went crazy? ",
        "Beth: We had some good times. ",
        "Lizzie: Okay, so will I.\r\nJust because this isn't some classic love story... this is my version of\r\nhappiness. And come on, did you really think I was ever going to find someone\r\nthat would accept me for me? ",
        "Beth: Yes. Yes. What are you say... are you\r\nsaying that Jonathan does? ",
        "Lizzie: Yes, of course he does. He doesn't\r\njudge me. Look, I loved Coop. I really did. But come on, Mom, I was bound to\r\ndisappoint him. ",
        "Beth: And what happens if Jonathan\r\ndisappoints you. ",
        "Lizzie: Jonathan could have bolted a long\r\ntime ago, but he didn\u2019t. Look, Mom, I really believe that we are having this\r\nbaby for a reason. This is my chance, my chance to make a family that is\r\ndifferent than the Spaulding\u2019s-- better, nicer, I don't know. It just... ",
        "Beth: You make it sound so simple. ",
        "Lizzie: Well, why not? ",
        "Beth: Yeah, why not? You ready? ",
        "",
        "Jonathan: Here we are. ",
        "Tammy: Yup, here we are. ",

        "Ava: Nervous? ",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I guess you heard Olivia\u2019s\r\nside of the story. ",
        "Ava: Yeah. ",
        "Jeffrey: So I better check and make sure\r\nyou're not armed. ",
        "Ava: I don't know what you want from me. And\r\nI know that you don't know what I want from you. So let me kill the suspense by\r\ntelling you it's nothing. ",
        "Jeffrey: You don't want anything? ",
        "Ava: I was raised by someone who loved me\r\nunconditionally, taught me how to ride a bike, taught\r\nme how to sew a prom dress. I didn't always make the right choices, but I knew\r\nwhat the right choices were. ",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that's more than I can say. ",
        "Ava: Yeah, it is. ",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I'm glad. I mean, it seems\r\nyou got lucky. ",
        "Ava: Yeah, I did. ",
        "Jeffrey: Look, all this with Olivia, it\u2019s...\r\n",
        "Ava: Unforgivable. Yeah, it is unforgivable.\r\nI can't even imagine what it must have been like for her. But I know you didn't\r\nknow about me. I know that much is for sure. ",
        "Jeffrey: Me, too. ",
        "Ava: So? ",
        "Jeffrey: So. ",
        "Ava: So, you came here for something? ",
        "Jeffrey: This is different. Normally when\r\nI'm in a woman's room, I'm either trying to take her to jail or take her to\r\nbed. Not that I'm a womanizer or anything like that. ",
        "Ava: You're not? ",
        "Jeffrey: Can I ask you some questions? ",
        "Ava: Sure, Dad. ",
        "Jeffrey: So you were born in San Cristobel? ",
        "Ava: Yeah. My adoptive parents were from Chicago. I lived there for a little while and moved around a\r\nbit after that. You know, they split up. So, eventually I ended up in Shrewsbury. My mother, she... ",
        "Jeffrey: The woman who raised you... ",
        "Ava: My mother. ",
        "Jeffrey: Right. So you came to Springfield... ",
        "Ava: You know what, I don't know why you\r\ncame here, but I learned how to ride a bike, I learned about the birds and the\r\nbees, and I don't need you to tell me, you know, about what kind of bad boys to\r\nstay away from because obviously my father is one of them. ",
        "Cassie: Hey, the door was open. I heard your\r\nvoice. Am I interrupting something? ",
        "Ava: No, you're not. ",
        "Jeffrey: Ava? ",
        "Ava: You know what, I need to get out of\r\nhere and get some fresh air. Thanks. ",
        "Cassie: Okay, why do I get the feeling this\r\nis just really bad timing? You two, you're not... ",
        "Jeffrey: No, no. ",
        "Cassie: Okay, good, because, you know, she's\r\nyoung. ",
        "Jeffrey: I know exactly how old she is. ",

        "Olivia: You have to know how much I\r\nappreciate your support. ",
        "Buzz: I like being appreciated. ",
        "Olivia: You stuck by me for so long. ",
        "Buzz: I wouldn't call it stuck. ",
        "Olivia: You have to admit it is a whopper. I\r\nmean, the guy that... got me pregnant is living here in the same town. I don't\r\nreally know what to do with it, I'll be honest with\r\nyou. ",
        "Buzz: You do it with me by your side. ",
        "Olivia: I hope you know how much that means\r\nto me. ",
        "Buzz: The feeling is mutual. Do you know...\r\ndo you know how much joy that you bring to my life? ",
        "Olivia: ( Laughs ) Stop\r\nit. Are you serious? Well, no, it's just that nobody's ever said that to me\r\nbefore. A joy? ",
        "Buzz: Yes. ",
        "Olivia: Even though I tried to... almost ran\r\nsomeone down and then I tried to... ",
        "Buzz: Would you shut up? You make me happy!\r\nDo you know what you bring to my life? ",
        "Olivia: Trouble? Turmoil? Toxicity? ",
        "Buzz: Well, that, but there is an upside.\r\nThere is a glorious upside. ",
        "Olivia: Go on. ",
        "Buzz: You know what my problem with you is? ",
        "Olivia: You only have one? ",
        "Buzz: It's my heart. ",
        "Olivia: See, the stress of all this is not\r\ngood... ",
        "Buzz: ( Laughs ) ",
        "Olivia: What? ",
        "Buzz: No, I don't mean physic... when you\r\nwalk into a room, my heart stops. ",
        "Olivia: Buzz... ",
        "Buzz: When I hear your voice... when I hear\r\nyour voice and I know that you're there, my spine actually tingles. I'm like a\r\nkid. When I hold you in my arms I'm like a kid on Christmas day, and that's\r\neach and every day. And then when I just don't think it can get any better,\r\nthere's that smile, you smile at me. ",
        "Olivia: Not enough lately. ",
        "Buzz: I know, it's never\r\nenough. You give me clarity, you\r\ngive me peace. You make me feel wise and capable, and I want to be a good man.\r\nAnd you also make me feel like I'm a great man every day. And I don't want it\r\nto stop for the rest of my life. ",
        "Olivia: ( Laughs ) ",
        "Buzz: You know what I mean? You hear that,\r\nworld? You hear that, Springfield? I love this woman! ",
        "Man: Good for you, pal. ",
        "Olivia: ( Laughs ) ",
        "Buzz: Hey, you have no idea. ",
        "Olivia: I have officially driven you nuts! ",
        "Buzz: What you've done is,\r\nI feel like there\u2019s... the weight that's been dragging me down has been lifted.\r\nIt is never going to drag me down again. ",
        "Olivia: ( Laughs ) ",
        "Buzz: Sit down, sit down. You can jump up\r\nand down later on. What I have to say is important, so... ",
        "Olivia: You're going to say it right here in\r\nthe middle of town? ",
        "Buzz: I can't think of a better place. So, Olivia...\r\n",
        "Olivia: Oh, great. ",
        "Ava: At least my father has manners. ",
        "Olivia: Jeffrey? ",
        "Ava: Dropped me a visit. He may be a monster\r\nlike you said, but at least he didn't try to kill me. ",
        "Olivia: Why did he come to see you? Is he\r\nfeeding you lies about that night? Are you naive enough to believe them? ",
        "Buzz: Enough, both of you! ",
        "Ava: If I lived for 100 years, I wouldn't\r\nunderstand why you hate me and why you spend your time being so negative when\r\nyou could be enjoying your life with a great guy like Buzz. Good luck. ",
        "Olivia: What? ",
        "Buzz: Can't you get past this? ",
        "Olivia: Get past this? ",
        "Buzz: Yeah, past hating Jeffrey and laying\r\nit on your daughter. ",
        "Olivia: Oh, well, sure, sure. You know what, I'll get past it when everybody in town hates Jeffrey\r\nas much as I do. How's that? ",
        "Buzz: Don't you want to get to know your\r\ndaughter? ",
        "Olivia: I know her. I know she'll get snowed\r\nby Jeffrey. ",
        "Buzz: Oh, come on. ",
        "Olivia: You don't think he deserves\r\neverything I can hit him with? ",
        "Buzz: I didn't say that. ",
        "Olivia: But you think that if Ava wants to\r\nhave a relationship with him, I should just let it go. ",
        "Buzz: Well, it's her life. She's heard your\r\nside of the story. ",
        "Olivia: There are no sides to the story.\r\nThere's only what happened, Buzz. Why should Jeffrey enjoy a relationship with Ava\r\nwhen he destroyed my life? No, no I'm not going to be happy until he is run out\r\nof town or run into the ground. Take your pick. ",
        "Buzz: I'm sure you won\u2019t. ",
        "Olivia: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I see her, I hear\r\nhis name. Can we get back to something nice? You were going to say something to\r\nme before. What was it? ",
        "",
        "Cassie: You know, it took me a long time for\r\nme to forgive you for lying to me about... well, everything. But I thought we'd\r\nbecome friends, Jeffrey. ",
        "Jeffrey: So what, are you having second\r\nthoughts? ",
        "Cassie: To think there's some other whole\r\nother set of lies... ",
        "Jeffrey: This is something that happened--\r\nsomething stupid-- when I was a kid. I've been spending the rest of my life\r\ntrying to make up for it. ",
        "Cassie: There's nothing you can do to make\r\nup for something like that. ",
        "Jeffrey: So you're not even going to listen\r\nto my side of the story? ",
        "Cassie: You know what,\r\nI don't even need to hear your side of the story. It's not about me. ",
        "Jeffrey: Then why are you here? ",
        "Cassie: I heard your voice. ",
        "Jeffrey: You could have kept walking. But\r\nthere's some part of you that still believes in me, isn't there? ",
        "Cassie: Yes. ",
        "Jeffrey: Well, good. Because\r\nI can fix this. You have to believe that you can fix things. I have to\r\nbelieve that. ",

        "Lizzie: At least until the baby is born and Reva\r\nis back on her feet. I know that it's not fancy, but it's homey. ",
