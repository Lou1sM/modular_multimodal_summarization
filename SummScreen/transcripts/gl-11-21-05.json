        "Michelle: Yes?",
        "Danny: With this ring, I thee wed, now and-- will it go-- ( big sigh ) forever.",
        "Ray: Michelle?",
        "Danny: Come on, best man.",
        "Rick: I'm trying.",
        "Michelle: I get nervous on this part every time. With this ring, I thee wed. I love you so much. You and Robbie and Hope.",
        "Ray: In consideration of these solemn and sacred vows, and by the powers vested in me by this state...",
        "Danny: Wait, wait, wait... you know what? There's something I want to say to Michelle.",
        "Rick: What else is there left to say?",
        "Michelle: What are you talking about?",
        "Danny: Just everyone hold on to your skirts. You know, there's something I wanted to say to you. I was going to save it for later, but I think I should say it to you now in front of these witnesses. It's something that you deserve to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Guess who's eating dessert alone? Oh, Alan, it was wonderful. Harley stormed out and Gus rushed out after her. You know, this is going to be easier than we thought. I mean, at this rate Harley should be out of Spaulding by Christmas. Do I hear \"ho-ho-ho?\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Tell me everything Beth said after I left the table.",
        "Gus: All right. Naturally she couldn't help saying, \"I told you so.\" That's her. But I really thinks she feels sorry for me.",
        "Harley: ( Laughs ) she said Spaulding was going to tear us apart again. She was right. We are so good.",
        "Gus: Yeah, we're very good. Very good.",
        "Harley: You didn't mean what you said about my job, did you?",
        "Gus: No. Come on, it's silly.",
        "Harley: Of course it is. You're not jealous about me working at Spaulding anymore than I'm jealous of you acting like you're jealous of Mallet.",
        "Gus: Exactly. Again, it's just silly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Angelo, bourbon, a double.",
        "Man: Rough night?",
        "Reva: It's just begun.",
        "Jonathan: I know if I talk to her alone that she would change her mind. Tammy doesn't belong with Sandy, and I know I could make her see that.",
        "Reva: The wedding is tomorrow. It's too late.",
        "Jonathan: It's not too late. All I need is five minutes.",
        "Cassie: Reva? I got your message. What's going on?",
        "Reva: Cassie, you know I only want what's right for you and for Tammy?",
        "Cassie: Well, of course.",
        "Reva: Good. As long as you know that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: ( Sighs ) and you look perfect, too. But what he can't see, what nobody else can see, is that she... Jonathan. Are you... are you really here?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I'm really here. Aren't you supposed to be at a party?",
        "Tammy: I had to get a groom. It was my last dare.",
        "Jonathan: Dare?",
        "Tammy: There's this list of things I'm supposed to do. It's kind of like a scavenger hunt.",
        "Jonathan: Whoa. How many have you had?",
        "Tammy: I don't know. What are you doing here?",
        "Jonathan: Reva sent me to look at an apartment.",
        "Tammy: There's no apartment here.",
        "Jonathon: I noticed.",
        "Tammy: Are you saying...?",
        "Jonathan: My mom set us up. She knows that I needed to see you the night before your wedding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny:This is what I want to say. Michelle.",
        "Michelle: Yeah?",
        "Danny: I love you, and I want to marry you. I promise you that I will take care of you and Robbie and Hope for as long as I live.",
        "Michelle: I don't know what I did to deserve all this, but I'm never going to forget how lucky I am.",
        "Danny: You promise? You're never going to forget?",
        "Michelle: I promise. ( Laughs ) I promise.",
        "Ray: I think you two finally figured it out.",
        "Mel: I think so, too.",
        "Ray: Uh, Danny, Michelle, in consideration of these solemn and sacred vows, and by the powers vested in me by the state, by God the almighty and his church, I now gladly, happily, and again, pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. ( Applause )",
        "Mel: Yes! Whoo!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Funny about parts of that fight. It seemed kind of real.",
        "Gus: Yeah, I know.",
        "Harley: You're not really suspicious of me and Mallet, are you?",
        "Gus: Suspicious?",
        "Harley: Suspicious.",
        "Gus: Suspicious. That's a hard word for me to say. Do I have something to be suspicious about?",
        "Harley: Nothing.",
        "Gus: Exactly. I mean, do I like you being around the guy eight days a week?",
        "Harley: He is not around me eight days a week. He just got back to town, he hasn't connected with anybody else.",
        "Gus: Introduce him to other people around time. I'm trying to be a good guy.",
        "Harley: That's great. As long as it's not Dinah. She's my right-hand man. I cannot have her personal life interfering with my work life.",
        "Gus: Corporate CEO talk. That's CEO talk. That's what I hear.",
        "Harley: We're losing fabulous canoodling time here.",
        "Gus: Is that what we're reduced to, canoodling in elevators?",
        "Harley: No, because we have our car. It has tinted windows and alleys. You're not going to kiss your way out of this one, Aitoro.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: For the first time in a long time something really good is happening, something we can all celebrate. I think Tammy's wedding can be a new beginning for all of us.",
        "Reva: I just think it's a big mistake to put all our hopes in this wedding, you know? I mean, it's just not fair to Sandy or to Tammy, or really to anybody.",
        "Cassie: What's unfair about hoping for a happy ending?",
        "Reva: What if there's no such thing as a happy ending.",
        "Cassie: Now what is that supposed to mean?",
        "Reva: Nothing. Cheers.",
        "Cassie: Reva, is there some reason my daughter shouldn't marry Sandy tomorrow?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: This is the best thing Reva's ever done for me.",
        "Tammy: Why would she want us here?",
        "Jonathan: Why do you think?",
        "Tammy: I'm supposed to be...",
        "Jonathan: I know. You know, some kids get Christmas presents from their moms and some kids get birthday parties, I guess, but I never got any of that stuff from Reva. But now she gave me you. She gave me my chance.",
        "Tammy: Your chance?",
        "Jonathan: My chance to tell you all the things that I've been feeling that I haven't gotten around to, my chance to make you see.",
        "Tammy: This is the night before my wedding.",
        "Jonathan: I know. It's my last chance. It's our last chance.",
        "Tammy: I came here because... and now...",
        "Jonathan: Look at me. Look at me. Tammy, this is our last night to be together, to say how we really feel. This is our last night to make things right. Because when you walk down that aisle tomorrow, it's going to be too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Excuse me, Reverend, sir. I was just stopping by to make sure everything was set for tomorrow. Don't worry, I'm not getting cold feet. I'd marry Tammy right now if I could. I can't wait to make her my wife.",
        "Ava: As your previous wife, I think she's a lucky girl. That is if you're marrying her for the right reasons.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I can't talk. I have to go back to the party.",
        "Jonathan: You don't want to go back anywhere.",
        "Tammy: I'm getting married tomorrow!",
        "Jonathan: Yeah! You're going to have the picket fence, the golden retriever, the two-car garage, a neighbor named Derek, and... and every Saturday at 8:00, you guys are going make love.",
        "Tammy: Don't do that! Sandy is great. I love him.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, yes, he's every mother's son. He will give you everything that you're supposed to have. But for one night stop caring about what you're supposed to have, supposed to do, supposed to feel, and tell me what you want.",
        "Tammy: I did.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy, we are the only two people in here. Please, look me in the eye, tell me what you really want.",
        "Tammy: ( Breathing heavily ) I want you to stop talking.",
        "Jonathan: What?",
        "Tammy: There's one last thing I have that to do tonight, and it's not on anybody's list but mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: To Danny and Michelle.",
        "Mel: Danny and Michelle.",
        "Rick: Listen, you guys, I know I speak for my father when I tell you how good it is to see those rings back on your finger.",
        "Danny: Well, I can promise you the next time we are ever at a wedding we will be the guests. ( Laughter )",
        "Ray: He says that every time.",
        "Mel: Oh, the cake. The cake.",
        "Rick: And music. We have to have dance music.",
        "Ray: My camera. Where's my camera?",
        "Danny: Dance music?",
        "Ray: I'll go get my camera.",
        "Danny: What do you know? They're all gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: You promised me when we get married that we would deal with our issues, and not between the sheets.",
        "Gus: I don't like you working at Spaulding, okay? You're just going to have to deal with that. Deal with it!",
        "Harley: Oh, that's going to help. That's really, really mature. How long have you been standing there?",
        "Alan-Michael: Long enough.",
        "Gus: Everything's fine, little Al. She's a firecracker, you know that.",
        "Harley: ( Laughs ) He's... he's right. It's... Gus is right, it's nothing. I mean, we're just, um...",
        "Alan-Michael: I know, I know. It's not easy being married.",
        "Harley: We were so good together before I started working at Spaulding. But I can't give up now, because if I do than he wins.",
        "Alan-Michael: Does it matter who wins?",
        "Harley: Yes. No? I don't know. I... would you just hug me, please?",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Beth: Nice to see you looking so happy, Gus.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: You and I both know from experience that love, even a love as sweet as Sandy and Tammy's, isn't always enough.",
        "Cassie: You're warning me, aren't you?",
        "Reva: I wouldn't call it a warning.",
        "Cassie: You're afraid that I'll try to live through my daughter. But you don't have to worry about that. It's because Tammy's found the love of her life that I can let her go.",
        "Reva: I'm going to go. The wedding is just a few hours off so you should get some sleep. You know, mama always used to say, \"follow your heart.\" And as long as that's what Tammy does then she'll be fine, no matter what happens.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Out of all the chapels in the city you come to this one the night before I get married.",
        "Ava: Okay, I had a feeling you might show up. I know you.",
        "Sandy: You knew me a long time ago. I'm a different man now. This wedding is nothing like the wedding we had. We got married for a lot of the wrong reasons, and I think we both deserve more than that. I honestly hope you find someone who...",
        "Ava: Someone who, what? Like somebody that's going to love me the way that you love Tammy?",
        "Sandy: Yes. The way I love Tammy and she loves me.",
        "Ava: Does she?",
        "Sandy: Yes.",
        "Ava: Then why does she break into a sweat every time she sees Jonathan?",
        "Tammy: I want you.",
        "Jonathan: I want you.",
        "Tammy: It had to happen.",
        "Jonathan: Had to.",
        "Tammy: I've been good for too long. This is what I need. I... I need one last night to get crazy before I get married, one last chance to get it out of my system.",
        "Jonathan: I am not something to get out of your system.",
        "Tammy: I didn't mean it like that. Jonathan, you know I care about you. I want to be with you. Don't you want to be with me?",
        "Jonathan: You know I want to be with you. But not like this. Not like this. Not when you've been drinking and playing hide-and-seek with your girlfriends and any last guy will do for a last roll of the dice. I want you to look me in the eyes and say, \"I choose you, Jonathan.\"",
        "Tammy: But I have. I have chosen you.",
        "Jonathan: I don't mean this. I don't mean this! I want you to choose me in front of your friends and family. Not in the dark, not in the barn, not behind closed doors. I don't want to be some dark, dirty little secret that you keep. I want you to tell the whole world: \"I am not in love with Sandy. I am in love with Jonathan.\" Can you do that? Can you do that, Tammy? Can you love me when the lights are on?",
        "Danny: Welcome to our temporary home, Mrs. Santos.",
        "Michelle: Home. ( Laughs )",
        "Judy: Hi.",
        "Danny: Hi, Judy. How are you? We decided to come back a little early tonight. How's Robbie doing?",
        "Judy: His fever broke, so he's doing a lot better. Both kids are asleep.",
        "Danny: Oh, great. Terrific. You know what, here. Here. It's a special night.",
        "Judy: Wow. Thanks, Mr. Santos.",
        "Danny: All right. We'll see you next week. Thanks again. Good night.",
        "Judy: Good night.",
        "Michelle: We can go kiss our angels good night.",
        "Danny: What? And wake them up? Hold on a second, I don't know about you but I've got plans.",
        "Michelle: Oh, plans? Really, tell me about it. Poor Mel and Rick.",
        "Danny: I don't feel bad for them. Something tells me they knew we were skipping out.",
        "Michelle: We're running out of tricks in our bag.",
        "Danny: Speak for yourself, Mrs. Santos. I still have plenty of tricks.",
        "Michelle: Mrs. Santos. I kind of like the sound of that.",
        "Danny: Good. We'll have it get it tattooed on you someplace special in case you bump your head and forget who you are again.",
        "Michelle: No, no, no. I'm never going to forget who I am again. Because all I have to do is look in your eyes and I know exactly who I am.",
        "Danny: I love you.",
        "Michelle: I love you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: My life is like a joke, that's why I find it funny. It's like a big freaking joke right now.",
        "Beth: Is it?",
        "Gus: Well, yeah. I think so. I mean, I'm like the bad sequel to Blake's melodramatic book. Check it out. First of all, I am partners with hammer-go- hammer. Okay? And back in Spaulding land, my billionaire papa, he's out taking refuge in the nuthouse while my wife, Marley, is becoming the corporate wonder woman while she takes over my family business. She's got enough time for everything else cooking but me. I need a cigarette. You want one?",
        "Beth: No, thanks.",
        "Gus: I know it's a bad habit. It's a bad habit, but I don't need any lectures right now, okay?",
        "Beth: No, I wasn't going to give you a lecture. In fact, you've had a hard day. Why don't you light up?",
        "Gus: You're turning out to be a friend. I appreciate that.",
        "Beth: Looks like Harley's found a friend.",
        "Harley: What is wrong with me? I keep dipping into the Spaulding well.",
        "Alan-Michael: You guys will be okay.",
        "Harley: No, I know. I'm not saying that I think we're going to...",
        "Alan-Michael: I know what you meant. And I also know what you need: Attention, romance, round-the-clock sex.",
        "Harley: Round-the-clock what?",
        "Alan-Michael: Sunbathing without the restriction of clothes, hourly massage, chocolate-covered whatever.",
        "Harley: ( Laughs )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Jonathan hurt Tammy. That's why he still gets to her. But once we're married, I'll help her forget he even existed.",
        "Ava: That's great for Tammy. But what's in it for you? If she's too damaged to give you what you deserve...",
        "Sandy: She's not too damaged. I finally found someone I can count on, someone who makes my world better, someone who makes me better.",
        "Ava: Better than what?",
        "Sandy: Better than I was before I found someone to love who loves me back. And as of tomorrow Jonathan will be out of her life for good.",
        "Ava: And I'll be out of yours.",
        "Sandy: Ava, you know that's not fair. My mom was dying, and she asked me to marry you. And I said yes.",
        "Ava: So you never loved me.",
        "Sandy: I cared about you. But it was too much too soon. I think you know that, too. That's why you agreed to sign the divorce papers.",
        "Ava: Maybe so.",
        "Sandy: And look, this isn't just my chance at happiness, it's yours, too. There's someone out there who will love you the way you deserve to be loved.",
        "Ava: You really think so?",
        "Sandy: I know so.",
        "Cassie: Sandy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: What's the matter with you? I'm offering myself to you and suddenly you're a gentleman? This is what you've been wanting, what you've been pushing for. Take me while you can.",
        "Jonathan: No. I said no.",
        "Tammy: No? And you call me a coward? Maybe you're the coward, Jonathan. Maybe you only want me when you can't have me.",
        "Jonathan: That's just it. I don't have you. I'm a part of your list. I'm a piece of your stupid scavenger hunt. Pick a groom up, chug shots of vodka, and bang a beast name Jonathan? What? What?",
        "Tammy: That's not what this is.",
        "Jonathan: What is it about? What is it about? You look me in the eyes right now, tell me you can't live without me. We will go together right now, tell Sandy.",
        "Tammy: And what, live happily ever after?",
        "Jonathan: No. Hell no. Hell no. I'm not going to sell you those stupid storybook promises. I know that we are going to have problems and pain and a lot of shocked, angry, disappointed people who want you to give your wedding presents back. I know that your mom is going to go crazy. But I know that we'll be together. We'll have each other. That's more than enough for me. Is that enough for you? Is this what you want? Okay. Take it. I hope he makes you happy.",
        "Reva: Tammy? Jonathan? Please tell me that I did the right thing.",
        "Jonathan: Reva, you really came through for me tonight. You took a big risk and it paid off.",
        "Reva: It did?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, it did. I know where I stand now. I think we both do. Right, Tammy?",
        "Reva: What happened?",
        "Tammy: It didn't.",
        "Reva: Tammy, I'm sorry, but I just wanted you to be sure. I know how you're feeling. You have to remember, I was the housekeeper's daughter. Josh was the boss' son. We weren't meant to be together. It was forbidden, unthinkable.",
        "Tammy: But you went for it anyway. Is that what you're telling me to do?",
        "Reva: Honey, I'm not telling you to do anything. My son loves you, but you know the kind of life he's had. And I don't know if he can show that love. I'm not sure. I mean, I'm not sure about anything at this point, except that I don't want you to make a mistake.",
        "Tammy: Do you think Sandy's a mistake?",
        "Reva: You're going to have to answer that yourself. You're going to have to look deep inside your heart and decide what you want. And whatever that is, I will support you, no matter who turns against you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Cassie, you know Ava, don't you? She's just helping me with last-minute details.",
        "Cassie: Are you okay?",
        "Ava: Yeah, fine. All this wedding talk, it just... it's silly, but it makes me a little weepy.",
        "Cassie: There's a lot of that going around today.",
        "Ava: Well, I'd better be going. You don't need me, do you?",
        "Sandy: No.",
        "Ava: Good luck tomorrow.",
        "Cassie: Thanks.",
        "Ava: You, too.",
        "Sandy: Ava, thanks. Thanks for everything.",
        "Ava: What are friends for?",
        "Cassie: Nice girl. How well do you know her?",
        "Sandy: Not too well. It's a funny thing how weddings bring so many people together.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Reva says we're all a little too invested in your happiness, I think.",
        "Sandy: Reva said that?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. She thinks it's too much pressure. Me, I figure if two you two can make it work, then there's hope for the rest of us.",
        "Sandy: Oh, we will make it work and I know I have vows to say tomorrow, but I'll tell you one right now. I vow to do whatever it takes to make Tammy happy.",
        "Cassie: I am so glad you are marrying my little girl.",
        "Sandy: Thanks, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Come on, you've got a very big day ahead of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Where's that bartender?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Yeah. Thank you.",
        "Beth: Thank you.",
        "Gus: Listen, you know, I don't want you to think that I... I don't... like Harley and I are not 100%, you know, committed to each other because...",
        "Beth: Oh, I get it. 100%. And if Harley turns to an ex- husband now and then, who can blame her? I mean, they're everywhere. Gus can I get a double scotch, please? You drink merlot, right?",
        "Beth: That's right, thank you.",
        "Gus: I just... I just want the woman back that I married.",
        "Beth: She's going to come back. And sooner than you think.",
        "Gus: Yeah, how can you be so sure?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Are you coming on to me?",
        "Alan-Michael: ( Laughs ) Honey, if I was coming on to you we'd be in my room by now.",
        "Harley: ( Laughs ) Oh, gosh, at least you haven't lost your confidence.",
        "Alan-Michael: Hey, be nice to me. I was offering you the ticket of a lifetime.",
        "Harley: What were you talking about? Nude sunbathing, chocolate-covered whatever.",
        "Alan-Michael: ( In Caribbean accent ): At my place in St. Thomas. All you have to do is grab Gus and hop on a plane.",
        "Harley: That sounds great. Oh, that sounds so good. But I can't. I can't do it right now because we're in the middle of bidding on these chain stores and we've got the merger and I've got Spaulding pharmaceuticals which is...",
        "Alan-Michael: You sound like my dad.",
        "Harley: Sorry, I can't do it. I'm swamped. You know what I really need? I need somebody to watch my back.",
        "Alan-Michael: In or out of that blouse.",
        "Harley: Please be serious. Listen to me. Dinah is doing a great job, but I need somebody who's familiar with the history of the company. I need somebody like... I don't know, like, uh...",
        "Alan-Michael: Me?",
        "Harley: Yes!",
        "Alan-Michael: You're kidding? What would Gus say?",
        "Harley: It doesn't matter what Gus would say. I'm running the company. He needs to remember that. So what do you think? Please help me run Spaulding enterprises. Oh, my gosh, somebody I can trust. We'd be great together. I promise I will not have you sitting at a desk crunching numbers. No. I need you. I need that cute smile to charm the corporate clients. I'll give you a huge expense account.",
        "Alan-Michael: Don't need that. But maybe a pretty assistant or two. Maybe three.",
        "Harley: If that's what it takes. Pig.",
        "Alan-Michael: Hey, be nice. No name calling. I want that in my contract.",
        "Harley: All right, all right. We'll negotiate that. Minimal name calling, I promise.",
        "Alan-Michael: About my job title.",
        "Harley: V.P. Of schmoozing?",
        "Alan-Michael: How about V.P. Of keeping Harley Cooper sane? For now. But if I get a better offer, like, say, consultant for the next \"S.I.\" Swimsuit edition...",
        "Harley: That could happen. You'd be gone, I understand.",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm gone.",
        "Harley: That's great! We're going to be so good together. We're going to rock this world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Let me ask you something, if there's something you know about Harley and the job, would you just tell me?",
        "Beth: You're really crazy about her, aren't you?",
        "Gus: I don't know if I'm crazy or a fool. What kind of guy waits around for a woman who's more in love with her job than she is with him? At least in my eyes.",
        "Beth: That day is coming, and soon.",
        "Gus: From your lips to God's ears.",
        "Beth: Gus, God has nothing to do with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: I'll call you.",

        "Michelle: This is so much nicer than last Thursday.",
        "Danny: Why, what happened last Thursday? I wasn't with you last Thursday.",
        "Michelle: Yes, you were. We took a bubble bath and then we drove to Laurel Falls.",
        "Danny: No, we didn't.",
        "Michelle: And then I woke up. I don't want to wake up this time, Danny. I don't want it to be a dream.",
        "Danny: It's not a dream.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, that's what you said last Thursday.",
        "Danny: Oh, stop.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, nice and pure and white. Just how you want it, huh, Tammy? \"Prince Richard Winslow, beloved husband, father, friend of Springfield.\" Hi, dad, how are you? Can you hear me? ( Laughs ) um, if you can, I could use some help. It's Tammy. I know you... you loved her like she was one of your own and, um, I know I'm not in her league and I'm a bit of a screw-up. But... what if going after Tammy is the one right thing that I did? What if I'm good for her? I don't know. If you think that's possible or that I might be good for her, maybe... I don't know, you could give me a sign? Like A... you don't have to light a candle or slam a door or anything, but, I don't know, something. Anything? Yeah, I figured that. Somebody's got to stop this wedding. It has to be Tammy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Maybe you could break all the rules when you followed your heart to uncle Josh. I'm not like that. I won't disappoint Sandy, my mom and all the people who love me.",
        "Reva: Tammy, Tammy, Tammy. Are you sure?",
        "Tammy: I am. I am sure. Tomorrow's going to be the greatest day of my life, so just please help me be strong and do what's right.",
        "Reva: I only wish I knew what was right.",
        "Tammy: What?",
        "Reva: Oh, I... I just said, \"I know you'll do what's right.\" And tomorrow will end just the way it's supposed to.",

        "Josh: What's wrong?",
        "Cassie: Tammy's not in her bed. She's gone.",
        "Danny: Yeah, there's something that I have that to tell you.",
        "Marina: Okay.",
        "Danny: Last night Michelle and I got married again.",
        "Jonathan: I want to be there when Tammy tells Sandy that she's not going to marry him, which is what's going to happen."
