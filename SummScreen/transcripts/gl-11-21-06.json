        "Dinah: How long can we keep this up?",
        "Mallet: I'll have to check with my cardiologist, but I think I'm good for another round.",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs ) I mean, how long could we be in this room for? ( Laughs ) We've been here for two days. We're hiding from the world.",
        "Mallet: We're not hiding. We're reconciling.",
        "Dinah: I know, and I love every minute of it. You know, my mother's going to send out a search party for us pretty soon. And although it's been magical and wonderful, super, the time that we've just had, but you know, I can't help but wonder if we're avoiding the inevitable.",
        "Mallet: What's inevitable?",
        "Dinah: I don't know. Being a real couple, real pressures. Being in the real world. Scared if we don't get out there and just do it and try...",
        "Mallet: Scared? Dinah Marler, scared? That's what scares you.",
        "Dinah: Except for maybe losing you again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Whoa. No, that's not, no, I don't do that.",
        "Dr. Sedgwick: Gus, it's routine.",
        "Gus: No. Is there something else I can do like...",
        "Harley: Dr. Sedgwick, can I just have a minute with him, please?",
        "Gus: No, I'm just saying that...",
        "Harley: Sweetie?",
        "Gus: Hmm?",
        "Harley: I realize that this is not your idea of a romantic date, but I have taken every fertility test under the sun and now it's your turn to prove that you know everything is running smoothly.",
        "Gus: Everything's running great. My system is just fine.",
        "Harley: Prove it.",
        "Gus: I can't take one of these things and go into a room and I know that you and Dr. Sedgwick and like six other people in lab coats know I'm in there doing my business.",
        "Harley: Block it out.",
        "Gus: I can't block that out. This is in my head. Other things are in my head, too.",
        "Harley: Like what?",
        "Gus: Like the price of gas, inflation, problems in the middle east, you know, it's negging my out. I can't it's just... it's not fair, because it has adverse affect on situations like this.",
        "Harley: Do you want us to have a baby?",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: Well, do this silly thing. Just do it for me and you know me, I'll be so grateful. I'll be so proud of you.",
        "Gus: Yeah?",
        "Harley: You go in there and you show them. Your numbers are going to be off the charts. They're going to write you up in medical journals, I tell you. You're going to be in \"Oprah.\"",
        "Gus: It's not that. Look, you had me at grateful. No problem.",
        "Harley: Will do this, please?",
        "Gus: Be right back. 30 seconds.",
        "Harley: At least a minute. Go team!",
        "Gus: Don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marah: Nice place you got here. You own it?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. What can I get you?",
        "Marah: Oh, that's it? You're not going to hit on me or at least flirt a little? I hear I'm your type.",
        "Jonathan: Do I know you?",
        "Marah: What, they take down all the pictures after I left?",
        "Jonathan: Marah?",
        "Marah: Hey, sis, it's great to see you. When did you get back into town?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, yeah, yeah, all that, all that. Hi.",
        "Marah: Hi. Jonathan, I've heard a lot about you.",
        "Jonathan: Uh-oh.",
        "Marah: Yeah. Word on the street is mom whipped you into shape.",
        "Jonathan: I'm sure she wants to believe that, but yeah, things have changed.",
        "Marah: Yeah, no kidding. So what are we going to do about our screwed-up family?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I knew you'd be back once you saw that I was alone.",
        "Alan: Well, you're not really alone, Elizabeth, with all of H.B.'s dead conquests here.",
        "Lizzie: I like it here, and at least the animal heads mind their own business.",
        "Alan: Look at you, all pregnant and glowing and...",
        "Lizzie: Just get to the point, Granddad, or better yet leave, because if Jonathan comes back and finds you here, it's not going to be good.",
        "Alan: Ah, yes, Jonathan, your loving and caring husband. Where is he now? Out chasing Tammy Winslow again?",
        "Lizzie: He is at work, trying to earn a living for his wife and child.",
        "Alan: Oh, that's very responsible of him. I wonder how long it will last.",
        "Lizzie: If you just came here to criticize my husband, you should go.",
        "Alan: No, actually, I came here because I wanted to show you something, something I think you'll find interesting. Photographer at \"The Mirror\" gave them to me. Those two still make a lovely couple, don't they?",
        "Lizzie: You should be careful about gossiping. Look at what happened to Blake.",
        "Alan: This isn't gossip. This is a public service, Elizabeth. You see, these pictures were taken last night before Jonathan swept Tammy off to the Outskirts, a place where they used to live. They were there for quite a long time, all alone.",
        "Lizzie: Tammy was in trouble. Jonathan helped her. That's the kind of guy he is.",
        "Alan: And I'm sure when he came home to you and doted on you and didn't tell you where he had been or who he had been with, because that's the kind of guy he really is.",
        "Lizzie: Jonathan made a choice. He chose me and the baby, Granddad. I don't doubt that commitment for one second.",
        "Alan: I didn't doubt your mother's commitment to me, either.",
        "Lizzie: When you go, please take your pictures. You should tell your photographer not to use such a harsh flash. They look so washed out.",
        "Alan: All right. But I'll leave the pictures here. I have other copies. Elizabeth, tomorrow is Thanksgiving, and you should be with your family-- your real family.",
        "Lizzie: Out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Sorry, I had to take that.",
        "Marah: No, you didn't. You just wanted to avoid talking about you know what.",
        "Jonathan: What Josh and Cassie hooking up?",
        "Marah: Dogs and cats living in harmony?",
        "Jonathan: You have a problem with it?",
        "Marah: You don't?",
        "Jonathan: Of course I do, but what am I going to do? I mean, Reva seems to be okay with it. Josh and Cassie seem to be happy together. Who am I to tell anybody what they should do?",
        "Marah: Well, what does Tammy think about her mom and my dad?",
        "Jonathan: She was cool with it, the last I heard.",
        "Marah: The last you heard? What, you guys don't talk about it?",
        "Jonathan: No, Tammy and I aren't seeing each other anymore.",
        "Marah: Really?",
        "Jonathan: Really. I'm having a baby with Lizzie Spaulding.",
        "Marah: I heard about that part. Good luck with that.",
        "Jonathan: Now you sound like my sister.",
        "Marah: You know, when mom was sick, you were the only one of us with her. Sounds like you did a pretty good job, so thanks.",
        "Jonathan: I had a lot to make up for.",
        "Marah: Yeah, you did.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, ho.",
        "Marah: So you're really staying out of this?",
        "Jonathan: Yup. I got enough trouble of my own. I do not need to be looking for more.",
        "Marah: Fine. Will you do me one tiny little favor?",
        "Jonathan: What?",
        "Marah: Come to Thanksgiving at Aunt Cassie's? Mom already said yes, and the whole family's going to be there.",
        "Jonathan: The whole family?",
        "Marah: Yeah, Tammy and Uncle Billy. And, hey, if you have a favorite recipe, I think I can swing it.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I bet you could. Recipe. You got a recipe for disaster, is what you've got.",
        "Marah: My mom and dad...",
        "Jonathan: Which is exactly what you want, isn't it? Total mayhem.",
        "Marah: Mom and dad have split up a hundred times. When things go horribly wrong, they rally. Disasters give them a little shove to help them see where their hearts really lie.",
        "Jonathan: Is that true? Wow. They say that I'm the bad influence in this family. Troublemaker.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Come here, I've got something for you.",
        "Dinah: We've already established that.",
        "Mallet: Young lady, get your mind out of the gutter. Look. It's your favorite.",
        "Dinah: Where did you get that?",
        "Mallet: Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? It was under the bed. I think Olivia needs to look into a new housekeeping staff. It's no big deal. It was wrapped. It's got its wrapper. Come here. Let's forget all about the chocolate.",
        "Dinah: No dice.",
        "Mallet: Come here. Why, why, why?",
        "Dinah: You know why? Because you've had too much of me for now, and I don't want you taking me for granted.",
        "Mallet: That's, like, not even possible. I just want to spend some more time with you alone, just the two of us, before we get out there into the big, bad, cruel world again. What? We can do other things in this room besides...",
        "Dinah: Sex?",
        "Mallet: Yeah.",
        "Dinah: Like what?",
        "Mallet: Board games.",
        "Dinah: Oh.",
        "Mallet: You don't have any board games. Hangman, tic tac toe, getting creative with chocolate.",
        "Dinah: That I just spit out?",
        "Mallet: The outside world will just have to wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Oh, great, so we'll have Gus' test results back when?",
        "Dr. Sedgwick: Given the holiday, sometime next week.",
        "Harley: Oh, great. Perfect. ( Cell phone ringing ) You know what? I actually... this is work. I have to take it.",
        "Dr. Sedgwick: Okay. I'll call you as soon as I get the word back from the lab.",
        "Harley: Perfect, perfect. Thank you. Why are you calling me? Did you finish what you started?",
        "Gus: \"Negatory\" on the deposit story.",
        "Harley: What's wrong?",
        "Gus: I can't do this. I... I...",
        "Harley: Sure you can, honey. Aren't there magazines in there? Look, just flip through the pages, find somebody attractive, dim the lights, wink at yourself in the mirror.",
        "Gus: I'm not going to touch the magazines. I don't know who's touched those before.",
        "Harley: Gus...",
        "Gus: Come in here with me.",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Gus: Sneak inside here. Come in here with me. No one's going to know. And I promise you, I'll make it up to you.",
        "Harley: Okay, well, maybe in the name of science and all.",
        "Gus: That's better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Dinah?",
        "Dinah: Right here. Can't decide whether or not to wear a jacket or just a sweater or what. This may be too chilly.",
        "Mallet: Is this some kind of a trick question?",
        "Dinah: No. Get up. Get dressed. We're going.",
        "Mallet: Huh? Why are women so cold? Whatever happened to snuggling?",
        "Dinah: No, no. I can't do this anymore. I have to know if we can do it, if we can do it on the outside world.",
        "Mallet: We can do it anywhere we want.",
        "Dinah: Come on. You know what I mean. We can't keep hiding from the world.",
        "Mallet: Oh, come on, we can try. Let's try.",
        "Dinah: No. No, no, no, no, no. No. Okay? Come on, we have to face our demons. We've got to get it going now. If we don't pass this test, we're going to be doomed. Okay? Now get up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: The first time he saw that, he's lived a long life.",
        "Dr. Sedgwick: Well, Mr. Mcgillicutty is resting comfortably.",
        "Gus: That's good news.",
        "Dr. Sedgwick: And he's going to be just fine.",
        "Harley: Good.",
        "Dr. Sedgwick: In fact, the nurses tell me that they have never seen him smile so much.",
        "Gus: That's good.",
        "Dr. Sedgwick: Did you produce the...",
        "Gus: Well, never made it into the cup.",
        "Dr. Sedgwick: Oh. Well, considering the circumstances, I think it will be all right for you to finish your project at home, but make sure that the sample gets to us within an hour.",
        "Harley: Within an hour.",
        "Gus: An hour.",
        "Harley: Okay. Thank you, Dr. Sedgwick.",
        "Gus: Will do. An hour. That's weird, isn't it? Hey. If you want, we should take the old man home for dinner. Kidding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: And these are the projections from the cosmetics group. As you can see, Alexandra's doing a great job. The numbers are way up, and... and with... Dad.",
        "Alan: Yes?",
        "Alan-Michael: I made Ava spend a week with an auditor to get you these numbers, even though I'm under no obligation to keep you in the loop. At least you could try to pay attention.",
        "Alan: Alan-Michael, I don't need to see these numbers. It was just an excuse to get you here to sit down and talk.",
        "Alan-Michael: Great. Well, thanks for wasting my time.",
        "Alan: I'm working on a project, a project that has very strong implications for the future of our family.",
        "Alan-Michael: And you're just telling me about this now?",
        "Alan: Well, I didn't have to tell you at all, you know.",
        "Alan-Michael: Yes, you did, because you obviously need my help.",
        "Alan: If that's what you think.",
        "Alan-Michael: Say it, Dad. Say, \"Alan-Michael, I need your help.\"",
        "Alan: Is it really necessary?",
        "Alan-Michael: No. I can go.",
        "Alan: All right. Alan-Michael, I need your help. There.",
        "Alan-Michael: So what do you need me to do?",
        "Alan: I need for you to spend Thanksgiving with me and the family.",
        "Alan-Michael: ( Laughs )",
        "Alan: What's so funny?",
        "Alan-Michael: I'd rather carve off one of my own drumsticks. We barely tolerate each other.",
        "Alan: I'd like for that to change. Now, this goes beyond our issues, all right? This is about the future of our family, especially the next generation.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie? Hey, Reva, I'm home. Lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: I've packed your bag. I'll stay here with Reva, until you can prove that you're worthy of being my baby's father.",
        "Jonathan: Look, the reporters were hassling Tammy. I got her out of there.",
        "Lizzie: And then?",
        "Jonathan: And then I should have walked away. I wanted to. I wanted to tell another promise I made to you yesterday. She needed me, so we went to Outskirts.",
        "Lizzie: Did you sleep with her?",
        "Jonathan: No.",
        "Lizzie: Almost?",
        "Jonathan: We kissed, once. We kissed once. And then she left, and I came home to you.",
        "Lizzie: Out of guilt and obligation.",
        "Jonathan: No, because I wanted to.",
        "Lizzie: You promised me. You promised me.",
        "Jonathan: I'm not moving out. Lizzie! Lizzie, I'm not leaving you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Well, have you made a decision, yes or no?",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm a busy man, Dad. I may already be booked for Thanksgiving.",
        "Alan: Alan-Michael, it's tomorrow. You obviously haven't made other plans. Now, I think we can put aside our animosity for one day. Besides, there are many families across the country that are in worse shape than ours.",
        "Alan-Michael: Dad, there are no families in worse shape than we are. I don't know if you haven't noticed, but you and I can't stand each other, Aunt Alex is lonely and miserable, and you could care less. Beth cheated on you, and you'll probably never forgive her. And Phillip is God knows where.",
        "Alan: And Elizabeth and her baby have just been co-opted by Springfield's pillar of virtue, Reva Shayne.",
        "Alan-Michael: Lizzie. I should have known that that's what this was about. You realize you're obsessed with controlling this baby of hers? And it's not even born yet.",
        "Alan: Think whatever you will, Alan-Michael, but the fact of the matter is, that little girl is a Spaulding, your niece. And if we don't do something and do something fast, we may never get to know her, and she may never get to know us. Now, when Phillip finally comes back, do you want to tell him that we didn't do everything in our power to fight for that child? Because it's certainly not a conversation I want to have with him.",
        "Alan-Michael: All right, so we get Lizzie back to the house for family Thanksgiving. Then what happens?",
        "Alan: We have a wonderful time together.",
        "Alan-Michael: Until you bring in the armed guards to take us to some asylum. What are you planning, Dad?",
        "Alan: Look, we're going to have a wonderful meal, drink, conversation. Come on, Alan-Michael, is it a yes or no, huh?",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm only agreeing to dinner. The rest of it, you can take care of yourself.",
        "Alan: Is that a yes?",
        "Alan-Michael: Tell the cook I like pumpkin pie.",
        "Alan: You won't regret this, son.",
        "Alan-Michael: Beth, you just missed your sweetie.",
        "Beth: I know. I waited for him to leave. Alan-Michael, I have a proposition for you.",
        "Alan-Michael: Does it involve cranberry sauce and you in my bed?",
        "Beth: You are consistent, I'll give you that.",
        "Alan-Michael: Consistently interested.",
        "Beth: In somebody else, from what I hear. We'll get to that in a moment. First, I'm sure you've heard about the low-income clinic I founded in Clayton. Well, we are still a little light on the funding. It's a wonderful project, very worthwhile.",
        "Alan-Michael: Plus, it gets Rick out of town and away from Mel for long periods of time, so the two of you can pick up where you left off.",
        "Beth: Can I count on you and Spaulding for a sizable donation?",
        "Alan-Michael: What's in it for me, aside from the tax deduction?",
        "Beth: The thing you want most right now. I will help keep Ava Peralta away from Coop. Interested?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Oh, there she is, with Mallet.",
        "Gus: You referee, okay?",
        "Harley: How do I look? Hi, guys, you rang?",
        "Mallet: Not me-- her.",
        "Dinah: Yeah.",
        "Gus: What's the emergency?",
        "Dinah: Well, I....",
        "Mallet: Is there an emergency?",
        "Dinah: No. No, no, no. I didn't say \"emergency,\" I said \"urgency,\" as in it is very urgent that the two of you get over here and help us share the good news and celebrate that Mallet and I are back together.",
        "Harley: Wow, that's great. We are happy if you're happy.",
        "Dinah: See the smiles? Very nice, smile-- bigger, honey.",
        "Gus: So what are you going here, then, if you're....",
        "Dinah: I just told you, we're celebrating.",
        "Gus: It's just that when we got back together, we checked into a hotel room and locked the door for a week.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, we had about four more days to go.",
        "Dinah: Okay, you know what? Why don't you guys join us and just have some champagne? It would be great.",
        "Mallet: Trust me, this wasn't my idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: I'll send you a check for your clinic, whatever the accountants deem appropriate.",
        "Beth: Six figures, please.",
        "Alan-Michael: Wow. Is that really what it takes to hang on to a married man these days?",
        "Beth: Rick, I'm so glad you could make it. We have so much to discuss regarding your involvement with the clinic.",
        "Rick: I know. That's why I brought...",
        "Mel: His lawyer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: So, as I was saying earlier, A.C. and I realized that we were just being crazy, you know, to stay apart, when really all we wanted was just to be together. Are you guys shocked?",
        "Harley: No, we're not shocked. Why would we be shocked?",
        "Dinah: Well, I know that you've had your doubts.",
        "Harley: I never had any doubts. You had doubts.",
        "Dinah: You had them at first.",
        "Harley: Yeah, and you were crazy at first, remember?",
        "Dinah: Yeah.",
        "Mallet: Well, I think everybody is happy for us and the world's not against us, and we're all going to be fine.",
        "Dinah: You know what? You're right, you're absolutely right. So let's just have another toast to love and togetherness.",
        "Mallet: Togetherness.",
        "Harley: Love and togetherness.",
        "Gus: The more together, the better. Mm-hmm.",
        "Mallet: Where's that waiter? Excuse me, sir, do you have a pen and paper I could use?",
        "Waiter: Sure.",
        "Mallet: Thank you.",
        "Dinah: So what are you doing?",
        "Mallet: I'm just writing something down before I forget.",
        "Gus: That's a good idea. Can I get a little slice of paper?",
        "Mallet: Yeah.",
        "Dinah: Anyway, how is the baby-making process going? Is that too personal to ask?",
        "Harley: No, it's okay, it's okay. Well, you know, we're still at it-- not at this very moment, but in general, yes, we are still trying to have a baby.",
        "Dinah: Have you told Zach and Jude that they could have pretty soon a little girl or a little boy?",
        "Harley: Yes, yes. I think they want a sister. I'm not sure.",
        "Dinah: Oh, good.",
        "Mallet: I was just giving you a cocktail napkin.",
        "Dinah: I can see that, but why?",
        "Mallet: To put under your glass so it doesn't leave rings.",
        "Harley: Huh?",
        "Gus: Nice tablecloths.",
        "Waiter: Your appetizers will be out in a moment. I'll just clean up some of this stuff here.",
        "Mallet: No, no, just leave those napkins. ( Harley and Dinah scream ) Sorry, sorry.",
        "Dinah: Ow!",
        "Harley: Sorry, Dinah.",
        "Mallet: No harm done. That's okay.",
        "Harley: I love those shoes.",
        "Mallet: Sorry, sorry.",
        "Harley: No, it's fine.",
        "Dinah: What is the matter with you?",
        "Mallet: I'm a klutz. I'm some klutz. I'm sorry. Is everybody all right?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, we're fine.",
        "Harley: Fine.",
        "Mallet: I'm a klutz. Okay, sorry. Everything's good, thanks. Sorry about that.",
        "Waiter: No problem.",
        "Mallet: I'm a klutz.",
        "Harley: Let me get this.",

        "Beth: So this is your employment contract, and this outlines your duties regarding staff management. Does that meet with your approval, Mel?",
        "Mel: I'll tell you once I'm finished reading it, Beth.",
        "Beth: You know, I wasn't expecting that you would take such an active role in this negotiation. In fact, I wasn't expecting that you would have a role at all. Does this mean you two are back together?",
        "Mel: What it means, Beth, is Rick's employment at the clinic impacts our family, and I'd like to see what he's getting us into and make sure it's to our benefit. Is this the number that you agreed to?",
        "Rick: It's good, yeah.",
        "Beth: Oh, he speaks. How refreshing. Come on, Rick, you can't actually think I would have cheated you.",
        "Mel: The word \"cheat\" has such resonance coming out of your mouth, Beth.",
        "Rick: I think maybe we should do this some other time, you know, maybe by fax or e-mail. What do you think, ladies? ( Beeper sounding off )",
        "Mel: I think you should get that.",
        "Beth: I think so, too, Rick. It could be the hospital. Mel and I will be just fine on our own.",
        "Mel: More than fine.",
        "Rick: I think maybe I should get this.",
        "Beth: You know, I really admire you, Mel. No, I do, I do. No matter what's thrown at you, you retain your composure-- so cool, so professional, so above the fray. Okay, well, some people might call you a tad prudish.",
        "Mel: As opposed to being a lonely, desperate nympho who pants after other women's husbands?",
        "Beth: But I know underneath that uptight exterior is a woman with needs, and those needs aren't being met right now. All I'm saying is, I'm just surprised you didn't do more than just throw Rick out of the house.",
        "Mel: Really? What would you suggest I do, Beth?",
        "Beth: Oh, I don't know-- pitch a public fit, put up a billboard, have an affair of your own. Oh, yes, that would be sweet revenge, wouldn't it? Don't tell me the thought hasn't crossed your mind once. More than once?",
        "Mel: I take my marriage vows seriously, Beth.",
        "Beth: Yes, but you and Rick are separated now. All bets are off.",
        "Mel: We're finished here.",
        "Rick: So you worked everything out?",
        "Mel: We'll be in touch.",
        "Beth: I'll look forward to hearing from you.",
        "Rick: So what did she say?",
        "Mel: What did you ever see in that woman?",
        "Rick: Honey, I know this is very, very awkward, but that clinic does some very important things. I'd like to be a part of it.",
        "Mel: She still wants you, Rick.",
        "Rick: Honey, I don't care what she wants. I don't...",

        "Harley: I'm going to go check in with work.",
        "Gus: That's a good idea.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I think I'm going to got to the ladies room.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, that's... you go right ahead.",
        "Dinah: Okay.",
        "Gus: I should check my messages.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I should... I should do that, too.",

        "Alexandra: Ah. Alan, our dear Hilda said you wanted to see me.",
        "Alan: Yes, Alexandra. I saw Alan-Michael this morning, and he told me that you were doing an outstanding job with the cosmetic division. As a matter of fact, he said that the profits were up over 8% from last year.",
        "Alexandra: Alan-Michael is informing you now? Since when?",
        "Alan: I told him he should reward you, but you know how tightwad he is, so I said I'd reward you myself.",
        "Alexandra: What's this? Eagle Rock Spa, Sedona.",
        "Alan: Yeah, well, you've always wanted to go there, so I called, made reservations for you to have a very pampered and long weekend. You're not going to miss anything here. Thanksgiving looks like it's going to be very dismal this year, so all you have to do is pack your bags, because the jet is fueled and ready to take you off.",
        "Alexandra: Well, I really don't know what to say, Alan. This offer is so thoughtful, generous.",
        "Alan: Well, you deserve it.",
        "Alexandra: I don't suppose you'd like to join me at this spa, you and Beth? Well, with or without Beth.",
        "Alan: No, no. I'm afraid that mud wraps are not my thing.",
        "Alexandra: Someday, Alan, you know, I think your generosity, you know, I won't be suspicious of, but I'll tell you, today is not the day.",
        "Alan: Suspicious of what?",
        "Alexandra: What's going to happen if I go away?",
        "Alan: Nothing is going to happen, Alexandra. Why...",
        "Alexandra: Nothing?",
        "Alan: All right, all right, I'll tell you the truth. I needed a reason to get Elizabeth here for Thanksgiving, so I thought if you had mysteriously gone off for some health issue or...",
        "Alexandra: Honestly, Alan, you are absolutely incredible!",
        "Alan: It's for a very good cause. And besides, I'll even make it better. I will send you to Europe to see Nick. It's been a long time since you've seen him. So what's the downside?",
        "Alexandra: Well, right at this moment, I don't know who I hate more, you or me-- you for making such a ridiculous, crass offer to me, or me for accepting it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Jonathan, you really don't have to do this. I'm sure that there are plenty of other ways to prove your devotion to your baby.",
        "Jonathan: No, I had this idea for a long time. You just gave me the push I needed, that's all.",
        "Lizzie: What's it going to be?",
        "Jonathan: It's going to be a picture of Roxy with a clown nose.",
        "Tattoo artist: Easy.",
        "Jonathan: Watch it!",
        "Lizzie: Sorry.",
        "Jonathan: Wow.",
        "Lizzie: Sorry. Come on, tell me what it's going to be.",
        "Jonathan: Something for our kid, something permanent. Just don't... you know, leave a space for when she's born so I can put her name in, okay? Cool. Something permanent.",

        "Dinah: Come on, guys, we can go ahead and sit down and enjoy our lunch. Come on, it wasn't that awkward.",
        "Harley: Oh, no, not at all.",
        "Gus: Actually, we can't stay, because Dr. Sedgwick needs me to fill up this sample....",
        "Mallet: Oh, man.",
        "Harley: So it's all good. Well, I'm so happy, you guys. It was great having a drink with you, and congratulations on the whole getting back...",
        "Mallet: We can go back to our table, if you want.",
        "Dinah: Somebody promised to meet me on the terrace, and I'm tired of waiting.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: So feel free, if you need more staff or if you want to change around people's job functions. I trust your judgment entirely. But there are things that I think that we can do better.",
        "Rick: That didn't go very well, did it?",
        "Beth: You mean negotiating with your bodyguard?",
        "Rick: I know what's going on here, Beth. You set the whole thing up with the clinic.",
        "Beth: You didn't want to be alone with me, and I understand that. You didn't trust yourself. No harm done. Because when Mel left, you stayed. That tells me all that I need to know. And by the way, I did have a very interesting conversation with your wife. Definitely gave her something to think about.",

        "Alan: It's a positive thing for the family, and you know it, Alexandra.",
        "Alexandra: No. All you're doing is trying to trick Lizzie, again.",
        "Alan: It's not a trick, if it works.",
        "Alexandra: Well, it won't work if all you're going to do is push her away, farther away-- and the rest of us, too, Alan. You know, you keep this up, she won't allow you anywhere near that child, let alone in her life, at all.",
        "Alan: Well, you're wrong, because she's finally opening up her eyes. That's why she's coming home tomorrow for Thanksgiving-- home where she belongs.",
