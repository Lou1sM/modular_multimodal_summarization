        "Sandy: Yeah, I know, the groom's not suppose to see the bride before the wedding, but I don't believe in superstitions or going a day without a Tammy fix.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, really.",
        "Cassie: Tammy? Jeffrey?",
        "Jeffrey: What's wrong?",
        "Cassie: Tammy's not in her bed. She's... gone.",

        "Jonathan: Maybe because I have.",
        "Reva: Thinking about Tammy? Don't go to that wedding, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, no, I want to be there when Tammy tells Sandy that she's not going to marry him. Which is what's going to happen.",

        "Michelle: He's helping lot of sick people there who haven't had any doctors because of the flooding.",
        "Danny: How's he doing?",
        "Michelle: He's exhausted, but exhilarated. He loves what he does. I just wish he didn't have to spend Thanksgiving alone.",
        "Danny: Well, maybe he doesn't have to. We could go down there.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, take a quick trip down south to carve a turkey?",
        "Danny: Yeah. Or we could, um, stay there.",
        "Michelle: You're serious?",
        "Danny: Yeah, I'm serious. Look, I know how much you miss working at the clinic. I see it on your face every time that you talk to your dad or when Rick talks about work.",
        "Michelle: Well, there's just a lot of people that are need of decent medical care and some children at risk.",
        "Danny: Why don't we go down there and see if we can help. You know? And then when your dad goes back out to California, maybe we can go out west with him. Why not? Make a fresh start? Leave behind all the mistakes we've made in Springfield. What do you think?",

        "Marina: Ava!",

        "Marina: Yeah, but sometimes it's good to see how happy two people can make each other.",
        "Ava: Most marriages fall apart.",
        "Marina: Yeah. A lot do, but if two people love each other enough to give it an honest shot I say why not?",

        "Michelle: Could we really just pack up and leave? I mean...",
        "Danny: Yeah. If we're moving on to something better than this, why not?",
        "Michelle: Well, I guess I could work with my dad in his clinic, and you could start a business.",
        "Danny: Right. Little man can learn how to surf! He's already got the blond hair, right, dude?",
        "Michelle: ( Laughs ) you've been thinking about this for a while.",
        "Danny: I know it's a big change. It's a big step. But I don't know. I just think it would be really good for our family.",

        "Reva: Jonathan, Tammy is marrying Sandy tonight.",
        "Jonathan: Uh-huh.",
        "Reva: Listen to me. That is why I sent you to the bakery. I ignored what my head was telling me to do and I listened to my heart instead. I wanted to make sure that Tammy was making the right decision for herself no matter what it was. I told her that if she chose you over Sandy, that I would support that decision. I would support both of you no matter who turned against you.",
        "Jonathan: You're serious? You would do that for me?",
        "Reva: Of course I would. But I also told Tammy that she had to tell me the truth, straight from her heart. And she told me that no matter how strong her feelings were for you, she couldn't live with the decision to be with you because it was too scary and it was too um... there's something else, too. She genuinely loves Sandy.",
        "Jonathan: That doesn't mean she's going to marry him.",
        "Reva: Marrying him she said was the right decision. And I have to support that decision no matter what.",
        "Jonathan: Sure you do.",
        "Reva: She's made her choice. She's made her choice.",
        "Jonathan: I don't care what she told you, Reva! By the end of the night, she will not be married to Sandy.",
        "Reva: You don't want to just change her mind anymore, do you? You're planning to stop that wedding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Well, have you seen Tammy this morning? Where could she have gone?",
        "Cassie: I don't know. Maybe she went for a drive? Her car's not here. But you are, which is not allowed on the day of the wedding so bye-bye.",
        "Sandy: Well, I can't go now until I know she's okay.",
        "Cassie: It's her. Hide. Make sure he keeps out of sight. Hide!",
        "Jeffrey: Go, go.",
        "Cassie: And I thought I was up early there morning. Where were you?",
        "Tammy: I just... I thought I'd jump on my errands early.",
        "Cassie: In your pajamas.",
        "Tammy: Would you rather I wore my wedding dress?",
        "Cassie: Sweetheart, are you all right?",
        "Tammy: Sure, I've got a guy who loves me and...",
        "Cassie: And you are going to be the most beautiful bride ever. Not that I'm biased or anything. Did you eat? Oh, that's a dumb question, of course you didn't. Tammy? Honey?",
        "Tammy: Mom, I have to tell you something. And I have to do it now before the wedding. I can't hold it in anymore.",
        "Tammy: I don't know how to say this or even where to start but I...",
        "Cassie: What is it, honey? Just say it.",
        "Tammy: I need... I need to tell you that I... I love you. And you... you mean more to me than anything. Mom, we've lived in shacks and in palaces, but it didn't matter where we were because I always had you to make every place home. Thank you.",
        "Cassie: Sweetie... all I ever wanted was for you to have a better life than I did. For you to not be scarred by all those years in the foster homes. For you to find someone to love you the way Sandy does.",
        "Tammy: So far so good.",
        "Cassie: Thank god. And speaking of Sandy, there's something I need to tell you, too. He's here.",
        "Tammy: What? Right now?",
        "Cassie: Um, yeah. I kind of stashed him so he wouldn't see you, but I'm not good at this rules thing so if you want to see him I will leave it up to you. I'll just tell you he's not over there.",
        "Jeffrey: All that and you cave in.",
        "Cassie: It's her wedding day!",
        "Tammy: You know what this wedding really needs is a marching band and a bear on a unicycle.",
        "Sandy: Hey, gorgeous.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: ( Humming the wedding march ) you know, I've heard, Ava, that some people find their soul mates at weddings. Who knows, maybe we'll...",
        "Danny: Hey.",
        "Ava: Um... I'm going to go to breakfast.",
        "Marina: I thought my dad told you that he'd knock you out if you came within ten feet of me.",
        "Danny: How's this? Is this safe?",
        "Marina: Come here. So, let me guess. You just had to have some of those Company hash browns this morning.",
        "Danny: No, I had to see you.",
        "Marina: You did?",
        "Danny: Mm-hm. Yeah, there's something that I have to tell you.",

        "Marina: Danny....",
        "Danny: ...If you don't want to read it you can just throw it out.",
        "Marina: You don't have to do this.",
        "Danny: No, no, I want to.",
        "Marina: I'm fine.",
        "Danny: I know. I wanted to. I wanted to.",
        "Marina: So is this happening soon? You're leaving?",
        "Danny: Yeah. So, take care of yourself, okay? \"Dear Marina. I didn't want to never see you again without telling you all the things I've loved about you and how beautiful you are inside and out, your kindness and how much fun you are. You've filled my life with so much of it when I really thought there was none left. And you make a mean muzaka. But most of all, I've loved your passion and not just for us, but for what's right. That passion led me to Michelle and to our little girl. And if it weren't for you, I wouldn't have my daughter. Thank you for that, and everything else you've given me: Your heart, your humor and all the great memories. You be happy, Marina, you deserve it. Love, Danny.\"",

        "Tammy: We really shouldn't be seeing each other.",
        "Sandy: But then I couldn't do this. And I don't think I could last a day without that. And I thought you might need me.",
        "Tammy: For what?",
        "Sandy: To remind you that what we're doing today is what we both want. Am I right?",
        "Tammy: You're totally right. For me.",
        "Sandy: I knew that. Now, let's get out of here.",
        "Tammy: And go where?",
        "Sandy: It's a surprise, come on.",

        "Jonathan: No!",
        "Reva: I don't think you're going to cause any trouble. At least I want to believe that you're not going to cause any trouble. But why do you want to do this to yourself? Why do you want to go there and watch Tammy marry him. Why do you want to watch him put a wedding ring on her finger? Watch him kiss his bride.",
        "Jonathan: It's not going to happen.",
        "Reva: Why do you want to do this to yourself?",
        "Jonathan: I have faith.",
        "Reva: Based on what?",
        "Jonathan: Isn't that the purpose of faith? I mean, I might not be people's choice, like Sandy, but I will be Tammy's choice.",
        "Reva: She's not like us, Jonathan. Going with you would be like jumping off a cliff for her.",
        "Jonathan: Then I'll catch her. Look, Reva, I am going to that wedding tonight. If you need me, I'll be sitting on the bride's side. Afterwards, she'll be coming home with me. Now, you, young lady, you go get ready for this thing. Home. Now.",

        "Michelle: No, not this time. And we're... we're thinking about moving to be with my dad. It's not definite yet. But I would be able to work with my dad in his clinic and Danny was thinking about starting a new business.",
        "Cassie: Wow. Well, that sounds great.",
        "Michelle: Cassie, if this is going to be too hard on you... I mean, moving Hope away.",
        "Cassie: Michelle, if... if moving your family is going to make you and Danny happy, as happy as I am, then you have to do it.",
        "Michelle: We're going to come back on the holidays and we would definitely visit you wherever we're in town, I promise.",
        "Cassie: And I might want to fly out and visit sometimes if that's okay.",
        "Michelle: Oh, yes. Please, please. Whenever you want.",
