        "Alan: To Elizabeth, I am grateful for the blessing your baby will bring to this family. Elizabeth, I wasn't certain where to put you-- next to your mother or next to me-- but I think this will work just fine. Phillip, your granddaughter is coming. I wonder if you even know. Hilda, is everything ready in the kitchen? Hilda!",
        "Hilda: Yes?",
        "Alan: I want everything prepared, all of her favorite things ready so when she walks through that door, she will smell everything, all right?",
        "Hilda: Yes, sir.",
        "Alan: Jeremy?",
        "Jeremy: Yes?",
        "Alan: Jeremy, I want you to go with Bruno to pick up Elizabeth. Now, there's also a gift I have for her out there I want you to give her. Now, the roads are very slick. Be careful.",
        "Jeremy: Yes, sir.",
        "Beth: Alan, have you heard from Lizzie?",
        "Alan: No, but Jeremy and Bruno are on their way to pick her up right now.",
        "Beth: Because she didn't return my phone call.",
        "Alan: She will be here, Beth.",
        "Beth: Okay, okay, I hope so. I'm just saying I have my doubts.",
        "Alan: Beth, listen to me. On a day like today, despite everything that we have been through as a family, I want us to feel like a family. We have a lot to be grateful for.",
        "Beth: You really believe that?",
        "Alan: I have to. We've lost a lot this year. You and I have lost a baby, the trust between us. But Elizabeth is coming home, and she and her baby will be here Christmas. That I guarantee.",
        "Alan: Look who's here! Oh, yes! Well, welcome to your first Thanksgiving.",
        "Lizzie: (Laughs) Look at him. You are the cutest baby ever.",
        "Alan-Michael: Where is my baby brother? How are you, little guy. You're watching football later on, you and me and dad. (Laughter)",
        "Lillian: Isn't it wonderful how a new baby brings the whole family together?",
        "Alexandra: Not a moment too soon.",
        "Lizzie: This is the best holiday our family has had in a long time. I can't wait until Christmas. (Laughter)",
        "Beth: You are incredible! Alan has already filled a room with presents. (Laughter)",
        "Lillian: Oh, Alan, that's so wonderful. He will hardly know the difference.",
        "Alan: Well, actually, Lillian, the presents are for all of you.",
        "Beth: My wonderful, perfect husband wants this to be the best holiday ever.",
        "Alan: And it will be, Beth, thanks to you. Thanks to you giving me this wonderful son who has made me very happy. Here, I want to make a toast to new beginnings. To our future and, most important, to family.",
        "All: To family!",
        "Alan: There is a future to this family. It's not too late. Just a few words before we settle in for this wonderful meal that cook has prepared for us. First of all, let me say Happy Thanksgiving to all of you. I want you all to know that each of you mean very much to me. I think you all know that family is the most important thing.",
        "Hilda: He's in there already.",
        "Alan: Well, what are you doing here?",
        "Alexandra: Happy Thanksgiving to you, too, darling.",
        "Alan: I thought you were going away, Alexandra.",
        "Alexandra: And I decided I can't want to be bait for Lizzie. I am going to fly out to see Nick, but my plane doesn't leave until later today.",
        "Alan: Ah. Well, there is plenty of room at the table for you, and I'm sure that Elizabeth will be very happy that you're here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Oh, my God.",
        "Jonathan: What is it?",
        "Lizzie: It's a baby blanket.",
        "Jonathan: You have, like, 900 of those.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, but this one is mine. I've had it since I was little, and my granddad sent it to me when he was locked away. And it has my name on it and my dad's and my mom's. I thought this was lost.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: That look never gets old. Pure, unadulterated disappointment.",
        "Alexandra: Nonsense, darling. Your father is very glad to see you here. Aren't you, Alan, dear?",
        "Alan: Absolutely, Alan- Michael, and I want us to be united when Elizabeth arrives.",
        "Alan-Michael: She's not here, huh? Surprise, surprise.",
        "Alan: No, she's not here yet, but she will be soon.",
        "Alan-Michael: Looks nice. Only one thing: I'm CEO. I'm the head of the family.",
        "Alan: Yes, we're very aware of your position at Spaulding Enterprises, Alan- Michael, but I am still your father and it is still my family. So back down there.",
        "Alan-Michael: Does the term \"figurehead\" mean anything to you?",
        "Alan: Well, Beth, you look beautiful.",
        "Alan-Michael: Well, we agree on something.",
        "Alexandra: Easy there, Alan-Michael.",
        "Beth: Thank you, Alan. Thank you both. Has anyone heard from Lizzie?",
        "Alan: No, but Jeremy has gone to pick her up, and since the snow has let up a bit, I'm going to go out and have a cigar before she arrives. I remember the first time Elizabeth saw snow. She and her dad went out in the yard and made snow angels.",
        "Beth: You know, Alan, I want her home as much as you do.",
        "Alan: Of course you do, Beth. You're her mother. And she will be here.",
        "Beth: I would even be willing to put up with Jonathan and Reva. (Chuckles)",
        "Alan: Well, I'm not that desperate.",
        "Beth: I think you are just as desperate as I am.",
        "Alan: Let me ask you a question: Do you ever think about him?",
        "Beth: Who?",
        "Alan: Our baby. How old would he be now?",
        "Beth: Alan, I...",
        "Alan: Don't tell me you never think about him, Beth. About how different things would be if he had survived. How much happier you and I would be. You would never have started that affair with Rick Bauer.",
        "Beth: Let's not do this, okay? It's Thanksgiving. I think we should be grateful for what we have.",
        "Alan: I couldn't agree more. Ah, she's here! Hilda, make sure the food is prepared. Elizabeth is here. We're going to be eating very soon, Hilda. So tell James to get off the computer. Oh, where's Elizabeth. Is she freshening up in her bedroom?",
        "Jeremy: She wouldn't come with me, sir.",
        "Alan: She wouldn't... (laughs) Still stubborn even this far along in her pregnancy. She demanded to drive herself, right? She didn't take her gift?",
        "Beth: She's not coming.",
        "Jeremy: Apparently, she and her husband are having dinner with the Lewis family.",
        "Alan: The Lewis'?",
        "Alexandra: All right, Alan, can't we just forget this, get on...",
        "Alan: No, this is perfect, absolutely perfectly. One night with those incestuous yokels, and she will be running back home where she belongs. Why is everyone looking at me like I killed the pet turkey, huh? We're going to have a wonderful, wonderful Thanksgiving dinner, and perhaps Elizabeth will join us for dessert, huh?",
        "Beth: Why don't I try calling her again.",
        "Alan: That's a good idea, Beth.",
        "Alan-Michael: You know, it's been a great night so far, but I think I'm going to go.",
        "Alan: Wait, wait, wait, wait. You're not leaving, are you?",
        "Alan-Michael: I'd wish you a Happy Thanksgiving, but we both know it ain't going to happen.",
        "Alan: So you're abandoning the family, is that it?",
        "Alan-Michael: Here we go with the family card.",
        "Alan: You know, Alan-Michael, you say you want to be the head of this family, but you don't act like it.",
        "Alan-Michael: I just know when it's time to jump off a sinking ship.",
        "Alan: Listen, son, we need you to be here tonight.",
        "Alan-Michael: No, you just want... you want everything you can't have-- the love of your children, control of Lizzie's baby, even the loyalty of your own wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: You're spending the day alone? Come on, you don't want to do that.",
        "Rick: No, I got to go over to Cedars, and then I'm going to do a shift at the clinic, and I'm on call.",
        "Beth: That is no way to spend Thanksgiving.",
        "Rick: I see. So helping people on Thanksgiving is a bad thing?",
        "Beth: You know what I mean.",
        "Rick: Anyway, I'm going to spend some time with Jude over at the Cooper's, but my wife's going to her folks' house and she made it clear that I'm not welcome.",
        "Beth: Well, I'm not feeling very welcome here, either. I want to see you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lillian: Happy Thanksgiving!",
        "Alan: Well, look who's here! Lillian! Oh, Happy Thanksgiving.",
        "Lillian: Thank you, thank you.",
        "Alan: I have a special place for you right here.",
        "Lillian: Well, what I came by to tell you is the hospital just called me. Because of all of this snow, there are lots of accidents, and I have to go in.",
        "Alan: Can't you just call in and then tell them to let somebody else do it, or something?",
        "Lillian: (Laughs) I would love to, I really would. I want to be here and eat turkey and pumpkin pie, but, unfortunately, I'm head nurse. I have to go.",
        "Alan: Wait, block the door, Alexandra, please.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, come on, now. That would make somewhat of a hypocrite, I think.",
        "Alan: Why? Are you leaving, too?",
        "Alexandra: Well, it was your idea that I go visit Nick. I'm sorry, darling, but, you know, as the Indians taught the pilgrims, you reap what you sow. Lillian, I'll go out with you.",
        "Beth: Where is Alan-Michael and Alex?",
        "Alan: They left, along with your mother, who seems to think it's more important to help strangers tonight than be here for her own granddaughter.",
        "Beth: Alan, she's not coming. I know how much you want her to be here because you think that once she's here, her baby will be here. But that baby is not a replacement. You know that, don't you?",
        "Alan: Did you call her?",
        "Beth: Alan, Alan, look at me. Nothing is going to replace what we lost, not Lizzie's baby, not anything. She's not coming.",
        "Alan: How do you know that?",
        "Beth: Well, I know enough not to sit around and wait.",
        "Alan: You're leaving, too?",
        "Beth: Yes. I'm going to run an errand, and then I'm going to help out at the Fourth Street clinic.",
        "Alan: So you've had this sudden urge to go out and help the less fortunate? Is that it?",
        "Beth: That's right.",
        "Alan: And would one of those less fortunate be named Rick Bauer? You're not fooling me. I know all the money that you spent on that clinic to become its main benefactor so you could rehire your lover.",
        "Beth: After you tried to take away his dignity by sticking him with the night shift at Cedars.",
        "Alan: You want to talk about dignity? Do you remember when you had some?",
        "Beth: Goodbye, Alan. Happy Thanksgiving.",
        "Alan: Wait, Beth, don't... don't leave, okay?",
        "Beth: No, I think that I have to. But you know, Alan, I'll be back. I always am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Have you ever played the \"Which hurts worse\" game?",
        "Jonathan: I'm not sure.",
        "Lizzie: More like that a contest is going on inside my body right now. My feet are so swollen they're going to explode. My back... gosh, my back is screaming. That's good, okay. My bladder is on fire. But we do have a winner because your lovely little daughter has been kicking me all day like Mia Hamm. It's worse, literally worse, than any other day.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, she probably knows what we're getting ourselves into with this \"Thanksgiving at Cassie's\" fiasco.",
        "Reva: Stop complaining. It's going to be fine.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, yeah?",
        "Reva: Well, maybe \"fine\" is a little too strong a word, but...",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, how about \"absolute train wreck\"?",
        "Reva: We're adults, right? We're all adults.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, most of the time.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I was bored before, so I made a list of all the things that might happen at this little gathering.",
        "Reva: Oh! Well, that sounds like fun.",
        "Jonathan: Well, Josh could punch Billy and Billy could bite Josh, and you and Cassie can scratch each other's eyes out. Then maybe Marah can strangle Cassie with an electronic appliance.",
        "Reva: No. Nobody is going to fight.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, wait! You have to get to the best part, where Tammy's sitting across from me at dinner. That's going to be great!",
        "Jonathan: Oh, let's just get this over with. Because if we don't go soon, we're going to get stuck there because of the snow.",
        "Reva: Oh, getting stuck would be scary. You need to go up and get dressed.",
        "Jonathan: I am dressed.",
        "Reva: Slacker!",
        "Lizzie: No.",
        "Jonathan: Whatever. Fine, fine. I'll be down in a minute.",
        "Reva: Okay, that's good, because you know what? I'm sorry, honey. I've got to go out and shovel the walk before we leave. I don't want you slipping and breaking your foot.",
        "Lizzie: Are you out of your mind?",
        "Reva: It's going to be fine. It'll be good for me. Fresh air, I can blow off some extra energy before we go to that place.",
        "Lizzie: That place?",
        "Reva: Are you going to be okay without seeing your family?",
        "Lizzie: I am seeing my family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Bell rings)",
        "Jeremy: Yes, sir?",
        "Alan: It is time for the meal.",
        "Jeremy: You'll be dining alone?",
        "Alan: Oh, no, no, no, no. You will be dining with me. Sit! Sit. No, no, no, no, no. Not... not down there. Here. This is the way it should be: Man and his castle and his faithful servants, yes. No, no, no, you're not my servants. You're my friends. That's the way it is, isn't it?",
        "Hilda: If you say so, sir.",
        "Alan: All right. Well, who will say grace? I will say grace, okay? Lord, to make us thankful for what we are about to receive, amen.",
        "Hilda and Jeremy: Amen.",
        "Alan: You know, saying grace reminds me of this joke I used to tell.",
        "Hilda: You're going to tell a joke, sir?",
        "Alan: Is that hard to believe, Hilda?",
        "Jeremy: No. You're hilarious, sir.",
        "Alan: Thank you, Jeremy. It seems that this minister was out on a walk one day, and he happened upon a big, black bear. But the bear started chasing him, and the man was running for his life. So he started to pray. He said, \"Dear Lord, let there be a big river.\" And all of a sudden, this miraculous river appeared. So he swims across it, and, of course, the bear's a very good swimmer, swims right behind him to the other side. Well, he gets over there, he's running for his life again, so he says, \"Dear God, please let there be a huge tree.\" And miraculously, a tree appears. The minister climbs up to the top, and the bear-- of course, great climbers-- climbs right up there, and he's about to... he's about to get the minister in the face. And the minister says, \"Dear Lord, please let this bear be a good christian.\" At that very moment, the bear puts both of his palms together, closes his eyes and says, \"Dear Lord, for what I'm about to receive, make me grateful.\" (Laughs) Oh, Phillip loved that joke, and I bet Elizabeth will, too. Well, Jeremy, you want some more wine? You're out there. What... is something wrong?",
        "Jeremy: Mr. Spaulding, you promised that Hilda and I could leave early today. And no offense, but we do have Thanksgiving plans with our own families.",
        "Alan: Oh, of course I did. It slipped my mind. Well, of course, by all means go to your families.",
        "Jeremy: Thank you, sir.",
        "Hilda: Oh, and Happy Thanksgiving.",
        "Alan: Thank you, Hilda. Thank you very much. Happy Thanksgiving to you. One moment, please. Jeremy, give me regards to your wife. Her name seems to slip my memory right now, but what is it?",
        "Jeremy: Steven, sir.",
        "Alan: Steven? Of course. Give Steven my regards. And Hilda, your family?",
        "Hilda: I don't even have a boyfriend, sir.",
        "Alan: Well, I should have known this. I should have known more about you, and more about a lot of people.",
        "Jeremy: If you would like us to stay and help clean up...",
        "Alan: No, no, no, no, no. I gave you my word. You can go, and you must go before I change my mind.",
        "Jeremy: Yes, sir.",
        "Hilda: Thank you, sir.",
        "Alan: Just remember to come back tomorrow so you can clean up this mess, all right?",
        "Jeremy: Yes, sir. We will.",
        "Hilda: Of course. Thank you, sir.",
        "Alan: Happy Thanksgiving. Lord, for what I'm about to receive, make me...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Come on, come on. I can't get you to go out for a little Thanksgiving toast with me? (Laughs)",
        "Rick: I told you I'm on shift and I can't do it.",
        "Beth: You can do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Oh, angels. I gotcha. That's enough, that's enough. Let's go!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bruno: What to you need me to do?",
        "Alan: Just pull up very close to the house. It'll be easier for me to get her inside the car.",
        "Reva: Hey, who ordered the turkey?",
        "Alan: Oh, Reva.",
        "Reva: That's who I am. Kind of wondering what you're doing here, though?",
        "Alan: Well, I just stopped by to wish Elizabeth a Happy Thanksgiving.",
        "Reva: Oh, good, because I thought maybe you were here to kidnap her.",
        "Alan: You're not planning on hitting me with that shovel, are you?",
        "Reva: Not unless you make me.",
        "Alan: Didn't you almost die a week ago, Reva?",
        "Reva: Yeah, almost.",
        "Alan: And yet your son let's you out here to shovel. Wow, what a guy.",
        "Reva: You know something, Alan, the reason why I'm shoveling is to try to build up my strength so I can fight my own battles.",
        "Alan: Which is why I thought would you be knee-deep in grits and cornbread at your Thanksgiving festivities.",
        "Reva: Well, actually, we're going to leave for Cassie's soon. Do you want some tea?",
        "Alan: No, thank you. When you say Cassie, you mean Cassie and Josh's, right?",
        "Reva: Yeah. Actually, Marah's there, too. She's home for the holiday.",
        "Alan: Really? Well, no wonder you were out shoveling. You're trying to build up courage to go into their little love nest and pretend that everything's all right with you.",
        "Reva: Sometimes, Alan, shoveling is just shoveling.",
        "Alan: (Chuckles) I assume that Elizabeth and her so-called husband will be joining the festivities?",
        "Reva: His name's Jonathan.",
        "Alan: Whatever. You know you don't want this. That little girl is going to be a Spaulding, Reva.",
        "Reva: And a Shane. Plus, I've been getting a real kick out of having Lizzie around.",
        "Alan: A kick?",
        "Reva: You know, Alan, Lizzie's been a really good friend to me, and she's showing me that she's going to be a good mother.",
        "Alan: You're starting to sound like a press agent.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, she was really in my corner when I was fighting for my life. I just feel like I want to return the favor, you know, root for her and Jonathan that their marriage will work because that's what she wants.",
        "Alan: I just want proof of her instability, that's all.",
        "Reva: Oh, Alan, she is sane and she's happy. And you know why? Because she has something to focus on for once, being a wife and being a mother, and that's good for her.",
        "Alan: What is your secret?",
        "Reva: Secret? Secret what?",
        "Alan: When you were in the hospital, you had the entire city of Springfield holding your hand, bringing you back to the living. Your friends, your family, even my granddaughter. I can't get anyone to show up at a lousy turkey dinner.",
        "Reva: It's tough being the king, isn't it? It's lonely at the top, just plain old lonely, huh?",
        "Alan: I don't know. You know, sometimes I think it would be better if I didn't get to know Elizabeth's daughter, because then I wouldn't have to lose her, you know?",
        "Reva: Alan, you want to know something strange? I know how you feel.",
        "Alan: Reva, everyone loves you. I mean, you're mother, apple pie, navy blue.",
        "Reva: No. Listen to me. There was... there was a time when I thought really that I lost everything and everyone I loved. For a while. And then a miracle happened, and it all came back to me. It was like an answered prayer.",
        "Alan: Not all of it. There was one exception.",
        "Reva: Forget Josh. My point is that I didn't quit on life. I wanted to. I was ready. I was ready to leave. It would have been so much easier to just give it all up, a real relief, but I didn't quit.",
        "Alan: Or make a choice from which there was no return.",
        "Reva: Yes.",
        "Alan: But you have a lot of support.",
        "Reva: What makes you so sure you don't?",
        "Alan: So long, Reva.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Everyone's gone. You're only ghosts.",
        "Lizzie: Granddad?",
        "Alan: Now you're talking to me.",
        "Lizzie: Who is?",
        "Alan: Elizabeth! Elizabeth, you came. Oh, thank goodness! Oh, it's so good to see you.",
        "Jonathan: Same go for me Gramps. Just take it easy, okay? Wifey's more fragile than she looks. You know, baby on the way and all of that.",
        "Alan: What are you doing here? Reva?",
        "Reva: Hail, hail, the gang's all here.",
        "Alan: Why?",
        "Jonathan: Told you he'd make that face.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, we're headed over to Cassie's in time for dessert.",
        "Lizzie: We figured you might have some extra food lying around. Do you have any of those yams, coconut creme pie I like?",
        "Alan: Reva, you mean you came here instead of going to your family?",
        "Reva: Well, this is family, too. And today, whether you like it or not, you're family, as well.",
        "Alan: Why didn't you call? I've been waiting a long time, Elizabeth.",
        "Lizzie: Granddad, do you have any idea what it took for me and Jonathan to come here?",
        "Reva: A pep talk and a big shove from yours truly.",
        "Jonathan: And I brought pizza because I don't know how often food ends up on the floor over here, so... (laughs) We should have something to eat.",
        "Alan: So you brought pizza. The father of your baby brought pizza...",
        "Lizzie: Is my husband. If you're going to be snarky, we can just turn right back around and leave.",
        "Alan: No, no, no, no, no. Pizza, pizza just fine, especially if it's served with the proper wine. You know, this is actually better than what cook had prepared for us.",
        "Jonathan: Do you mind, Alan?",
        "Alan: Oh, no, no. Feel free, Jonathan. A little more wine.",
        "Reva: Stop that.",
        "Jonathan: (Laughs)",
        "Reva: That is terrible.",
        "Alan: I don't know how you do it, son. Of course, I don't know how you do most of what you do.",
        "Lizzie: Granddad.",
        "Alan: All right, not tonight. Not tonight.",
        "Reva: That a boy!",
        "Alan: You know, if the Indians had discovered pizza, things would be different, wouldn't they?",
        "Reva: Personally, I prefer the traditional Thanksgiving meal.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, because you're so, you know, normal and conservative.",
        "Reva: Who at this table has room to talk, can I ask you that? Exactly.",
        "Alan: Well, with any luck, Titania will be better than all of us.",
        "Jonathan: Who is Titania?",
        "Alan: Your little girl, and your daughter.",
        "Lizzie: Tatania?",
        "Alan: Yes. It's a name that I've always been fond of, Elizabeth. It's right out of Shakespeare. She was a fairy queen.",
        "Jonathan: (Laughs) You're kidding, right?",
        "Alan: No, I'm not kidding. What's wrong with Titania?",
        "Jonathan: (Laughs) Everything. She's going to go to school, and what are the kids are going to call her for short? (Laughs)",
        "Alan: All right, why don't you give us some of your classic names, the names you've come up with. Probably something like Sue.",
        "Reva: You know, I'd like to talk about pizza again. I prefer white pizza with the feta and the broccoli.",
        "Alan: Leave it to Jonathan to pour dirt on something very beautiful.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, stop. Talk like a normal person.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, Jonathan, Granddad, please.",
        "Jonathan: I'd rather name my daughter after a motorcycle than a fairy queen. (Laughs)",
        "Reva: Hey, you know what? That worked for the Cooper's.",
        "Alan: Reva, stay out of this.",
        "Reva: I'm family, remember? Okay, I shouldn't have said anything. I'm sorry. But you shouldn't have said anything either, Alan. You remember having a child, how great that was, the thrill of coming up with a name that was just right. And that's a parents' obligation, no one else's.",
        "Alan: All right, Reva, but you will be sorry when they come up with a name, something like Gasolina or something.",
        "Jonathan: (Laughs)",
        "Alan: Of course, that probably wouldn't bother you at all, since your brother's named Rusty.",
        "Reva: Okay, here we go with the trailer trash talk again. So much for the cease fire.",
        "Alan: All right. But I'm just thinking about what's best for this child. Trying to look out for her, that's all. Has anyone even thought about her education, here, huh?",
        "Lizzie: She's not even born yet.",
        "Alan: Getting into boarding school right now is very competitive. I think that I should probably send a check to Allston tomorrow to insure that she doesn't end up on a waiting list.",
        "Lizzie: She's not going there.",
        "Alan: What do mean, she's not going there? Every Spaulding woman has gone to Allston.",
        "Lizzie: I hated that place.",
        "Jonathan: So much that you burned it down, from what I here.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, don't help me.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, I was just... (laughs)",
        "Lizzie: I just wouldn't send our little girl to that freak farm, okay?",
        "Jonathan: Okay, okay. I went to boarding school, and look how I turned out.",
        "Reva: Okay, you know what? I think it's time that we head out, you guys. We should head over to Cassie's now... soon... now.",
        "Alan: All right, but all of this was just to try to look out for what's best for this child, that's all.",
        "Lizzie: We've heard that before.",
        "Jonathan: Bottom line is you don't get a vote.",
        "Alan: All right, you can name the child, you can send her to whatever school you like, you can buy her baby formula, any kind you want. But just promise me this: You will let me be a part of this little girl's life. Promise me that, please.",
        "Reva: You know what? It's Thanksgiving. Why don't we count our blessings, huh? I'll start. I feel blessed just to be alive.",
        "Jonathan: I'll drink to that. To being a dad, no matter how it happened. Sorry, there's no offense meant by that.",
        "Lizzie: It's okay. I am blessed to have Jonathan in my life and his daughter in my tummy. (Chuckles) And that Reva has welcomed me into her home. It's the home that I've always wanted.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, this is your home. It's always been your home, long before you fell in with these people.",
        "Lizzie: Fell in?",
        "Jonathan: These people?",
        "Alan: All I meant to say was...",
        "Lizzie: No. It's always us against everyone. It's Spaulding's versus the world, always.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, don't be naive. Do you think it's a coincidence that Reva invited you into her home for some safe haven?",
        "Jonathan: Oh, leave it alone. Come on!",
        "Alan: No. Look, if I had done the same thing, you would all accuse me of trying to get my hooks into this little child. When she does it, it's family and nurturing.",
        "Jonathan: Because that's what it is!",
        "Alan: Don't come into my house hollering at me like this!",
        "Reva: We're going to leave. We're going to wrap this up. We're out of here.",
        "Lizzie: Water.",
        "Reva: Lizzie, we're not going to make any more toasts. Come on, we've got to get over to Cassie's.",
        "Jonathan: You don't look too good.",
        "Lizzie: It's my water. It just broke.",
        "Reva: Oh, honey! You're going to have the baby.",
        "Lizzie: We're going to have the baby!",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Reva: Babies take a while to come. We have time.",
        "Lizzie: How long?",
        "Reva: Dylan was 36 hours.",
        "Marah: Maybe mom doesn't want to come and spend Thanksgiving with her husband and another woman.",
        "Josh: This is a very important night. It's a chance for us to prove that we're still a family.",
        "Lizzie: We're stuck! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
