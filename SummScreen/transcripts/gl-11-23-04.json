        "Edmund: I made you some tea, chamomile.",
        "Cassie: Thanks just put that down.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, it's late. You're tired. You need your rest after... well, you need your rest.",
        "Cassie: You're fussing over me. I'm not pregnant anymore. I never even knew that I was. I didn't really knew I lost anything after I'd lost it, and... I mean, it's sad, but it's... I mean, there is something amazing, is that I can conceive, so that's great, you know. Edmund, what is it?",
        "Edmund: Would you want a child?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: Like father, like son, eh, Roger? First you hold me prisoner, and now it's Sebastian. Oh, God help me! What are you... where have you been? Why did you leave me alone all this time?",
        "Sebastian: I was resting.",
        "Holly: Three days?",
        "Sebastian: It's amazing how time flies, huh?",
        "Holly: Did you find Ed? Michelle?",
        "Sebastian: I arranged for dinner. Are you hungry?",
        "Holly: Oh, God. You're always thinking of me, aren't you?",
        "Sebastian: I was going to ask if you wanted company, but I guess you don't, so...",
        "Holly: No, stay, stay. It's not like I have any options, is it?",
        "Sebastian: No.",
        "Holly: So, you got me. You won. I'm all locked up, I'm tired, and I'm hungry. Might as well make the best of it, huh?",
        "Sebastian: Might as well dress for the occasion, too, huh? I mean, if you're up to it.",
        "Holly: Right. Yeah, I'll change, right away.",
        "Sebastian: Good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Lizzie, you do know this is so wrong what you're doing.",
        "Lizzie: No, I think it's great. Where's everybody at?",
        "Coop: Hold on a second, lizard, here.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, sorry, Henry. From now on, no \"lizard,\" okay? It's Miss Spaulding. I'm your boss.",
        "Coop: Yes, you certainly are the boss.",
        "Lizzie: I still can't believe my father gave me this place.",
        "Coop: Yeah. Some joke, right?",
        "Lizzie: No. No joke. My dad knew I'd run this place the right way, and I plan to. Ugh.",
        "Coop: Listen, at least let me break the news to my family.",
        "Lizzie: You know, I think I'm going to tell them. I mean it is the boss's job to keep her employees informed. Isn't that right, Roxy? Come here, honey. Come on. Oh, yes, come to mama.",
        "Coop: Well, this is going to be ugly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Well, I appreciate this, Governor, and thank you so much for understanding Phillip's loss and the toll it's taken on my family. I can assure you, sir, that I will not rest until I get justice for my boy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: I thought you'd be in your nice, cozy cell by now.",
        "Alexandra: Back in my hole, where no one would hear what I have to say.",
        "Buzz: You don't know anything.",
        "Alexandra: I saw you at company the night Phillip was murdered.",
        "Buzz: I don't know anything about that.",
        "Alexandra: Well, I was there. I saw you race out of the restaurant and tear into into the night.",
        "Buzz: Is that a fact?",
        "Alexandra: Yes. No question it was you. What I don't know is if Phillip was alive when you left.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: What is your drug of choice, your demon?",
        "Sebastian: I don't know. Violence, maybe? At least that's what some people would say, I suppose.",
        "Holly: Would they be right?",
        "Sebastian: What do you do when the temptation's too strong?",
        "Holly: It's not a complete tragedy. I've had to find other sensual experiences.",
        "Sebastian: Like what?",
        "Holly: Oh, you know. Like food. (Chuckles)",
        "Sebastian: Ah. Of course. Food.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Can I be honest with you about something?",
        "Edmund: Always.",
        "Cassie: I'm feeling overwhelmed right now. I mean, not just about this news, but the whole Dinah thing, and a wedding I have to plan. I haven't even started yet, Edmund. And then there are the boys. I mean they need so much more attention than I can even give them.",
        "Edmund: They get attention from you, Cassie. You're a wonderful mother.",
        "Cassie: Oh, really? Then why does my daughter have to leave home to get better?",
        "Edmund: She'll come around, Cassie. She will. She needs you.",
        "Cassie: To make her life worse, that's what she needs me for.",
        "Edmund: No, Cassie, no. Tammy was seduced and humiliated by her own cousin. That's not her fault; it's certainly not yours.",
        "Cassie: No, but it... I have to deal with it now. Tammy's my daughter. And until this gets resolved, until I can be the mother that Tammy needs me to be, I don't think I can think about anything else. Do you understand?",
        "Edmund: Of course, of course.",
        "Cassie: I have to go check on the boys.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: What were you doing out of prison the night that Phillip was killed? Did you get a note to meet him at company, too? And why aren't you out on Frank's suspect board? I mean, if Frank knew you were AWOL the night that he was killed...",
        "Alexandra: Well, they'll find out soon enough, I'm sure of that. I mean, once the pressure mounts on this investigation, believe me, that guard who assisted me or one of the prisoners is certainly going to squeal.",
        "Buzz: Some criminal mastermind you turned out to be.",
        "Alexandra: Come on, secrets like this never stay secret. You know that. Nobody knows it better than I do. But you don't seem very shocked that I saw you.",
        "Buzz: That's because I saw you, too.",
        "Alexandra: Oh.",
        "Buzz: So, we knew I had a meeting with Phillip the night he was killed. I guess you were headed to the same place, too.",
        "Alexandra: Yes. I was going to try to talk some sense into him about these children. But I never made it in, which means that I don't know if Phillip was alive when you left.",
        "Buzz: Ditto. What do you want?",
        "Alexandra: I would simply like to come to some understanding.",
        "Buzz: Well, that covers a multitude of sins.",
        "Alexandra: They will find out. They will find out that I was out of my cell and at company, but they don't necessarily know where I went. Maybe they won't find out you were even there. But if they do, I will be your alibi and you will be mine. How's that for an understanding?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: I don't know what's going on.",
        "Sebastian: Actually, it was the one thing in my life that made any sense.",
        "Holly: Then you lost him and now you have to deal with the most terrifying thing. And you're all alone.",
        "Sebastian: That's where this comes in.",
        "Holly: Sebastian... (awkward laugh) I hate the way you've treated me, but I understand what's behind it. Everything that you've had to do, you've been driven to by loneliness and terror. I understand. I know what it means to be desperate.",
        "Sebastian: This little performance is definitely proof of that.",
        "Holly: What do you mean?",
        "Sebastian: You're trying to seduce me, Holly. And what I'm wondering right now is, how far are you willing to go?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: You're the boss? No. No, no, no. No, no, no. No.",
        "Lizzie: You know, saying it over and over isn't going to make it any more true.",
        "Marina: It just doesn't make any sense, Lizzie. Why would you even want to set foot in this place when your father...",
        "Lizzie: That's why, all right? I feel closest to my dad here.",
        "Marina: Okay, that is just weird.",
        "Lizzie: Well, my dad wanted it. I'm not going to let him down, all right? I'm going to keep up with what he started.",
        "Coop: Now, see, that right there is going to make people very nervous, Lizzie.",
        "Marina: Or angry. Coop, what is going on here?",
        "Lizzie: Well, before my dad died, he bought company from Buzz, fair and square. And I want that to mean something, all right, Marina?",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, is there a problem here?",
        "Lizzie: No, Granddad. I'm just dealing with employee issues, you know?",
        "Marina: Yeah, like why my grandfather would want to sell this place, a place he loves, to anyone, let alone a Spaulding.",
        "Alan: Marina, he did it for you and young Henry here.",
        "Marina: What?",
        "Alan: Let me tell you something: Never underestimate what a man will do for his children and his grandchildren.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, like my dad.",
        "Marina: Okay, well, I've got news for you, okay? Coop and me, my Dad and Aunt Harley? Selling company is the last thing any of us would want.",
        "Coop: Yeah, and if your father was the buyer, the last thing he'd want to do is have this place standing. He'd probably tear this joint down.",
        "Lizzie: Then why would he give it to me? What, so I could have some vacant lot to play with? I don't think so.",
        "Alan: Nor do I.",
        "Lizzie: You know you were with me and my dad when it came to the end.",
        "Marina: Coop saved you from him.",
        "Lizzie: My dad was sick, all right, and even so, he still loved me. That's why he wanted me out of Springfield, because he knew it was right for me. So all I can do is honor his memories and what he wanted.",
        "Marina: For you to run our restaurant?",
        "Lizzie: My restaurant, and yes, I am going to run it. I let him down when it meant the most, and I'm not going to do it again.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, your father would be very proud of you right now. Now, I will see you back at the house.",
        "Marina: If I burn someone, will they sue you?",
        "Coop: Lizzie, listen. Is this really what you want? Being here every day, staring at that spot, torturing yourself? You're just going to end up torturing all of us.",
        "Lizzie: (Clears throat) You know what? I can handle it. I have to. I have my own plans for company.",
        "Marina: Oh, yeah? Like what?",
        "Lizzie: I'm going to make this place not suck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: What if I don't accept your offer?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, Buzz, please. You can't... I mean, I... I've already been through so much.",
        "Buzz: Haven't we all?",
        "Alexandra: Yeah, but at least you're free. I mean, come on, you've got your family around you, no matter how bad things get to comfort you. I'm alone and in a cell.",
        "Buzz: Except when you buy your way out for a breather.",
        "Alexandra: Yeah, well, that was all about to come to an end.",
        "Buzz: Why?",
        "Alexandra: See, Phillip had me taken down to the docks, and I was understanding he was making arrangements for me to be released. However, he informed me I was not about to be free. He was going to have me transferred from the local prison system into another system where I would eventually just get lost.",
        "Buzz: Sounds like Phillip thought you'd betrayed him.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, yeah. He thought I would turn Lizzie against him.",
        "Buzz: Any truth to that?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, Lord, I love that girl. She was about to be victimized by Phillip's illness, same as everybody else.",
        "Buzz: So you were trying to protect her.",
        "Alexandra: Well, yes. (Laughs) look, to Phillip, that's a knife in his back. I mean, he thought he was trying to protect her. Well, thank God for Alan. I mean he saved me. He saved me from some punishment, at least for a while. Buzz, I really... I just can't take this anymore. I can't take it. I can't take the cold steel cots, the prying eyes, the endless, endless I mean empty hours.",
        "Buzz: Honey. I'm sorry. I can't be your alibi.",
        "Alexandra: Why? Why not?",
        "Buzz: Because I don't think you got out of your cell to talk sense into Phillip that night. I think you killed him.",
        "Alexandra: That's interesting, because I think maybe you killed him.",
        "Buzz: My darling, why would you make a deal with a guy that you thought had murdered your beloved nephew?",
        "Alexandra: Come on Buzz. When you found out that Phillip was dead, why didn't you go to Frank and tell him that I was at company and not in my cell that night? But you didn't do that, did you?",
        "Buzz: No.",
        "Alexandra: Well, doesn't that say something? Doesn't that say that somewhere deep inside you still have some feelings for me?",
        "Buzz: Oh, we've been through this!",
        "Alexandra: Well, you know that's part of it. You know it is.",
        "Buzz: What you did cannot be undone. It's just too big and heavy to float away.",
        "Alexandra: I'm not asking you to forget, all right? I'm not asking you to forgive or even pretend to.",
        "Buzz: Well, what is it you want?",
        "Alexandra: I want things to be better between our families.",
        "Buzz: Tell it to Santa Claus.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, come on. What do you want? What do you want? One more death? These two families can't walk down the streets of this town without seething hatred at each other. I mean, how much more of this can you stand? Aren't you sick of it?",
        "Buzz: Oh, I am, yeah.",
        "Alexandra: Well, then, let's change it. Between the two of us, we've got more wisdom than Harley and Gus and Alan and Lizzie and Frank.",
        "Buzz: The sages of Springfield.",
        "Alexandra: Well, aren't we? You and I have been around long enough to know that we're all going to end up like Phillip if we don't turn things around.",
        "Buzz: I don't exactly see you as a peacemaker, Alex.",
        "Alexandra: Well, try me, you know? Better yet, why don't you just help me? We can set a good enough example to show our families how to get on the road to reconciliation.",
        "Buzz: You really believe that?",
        "Alexandra: I don't have to believe it. I just have to want it. We have to want it and try to do it. Okay, I'm going to ask you one more... one more time. Can we have a deal?",
        "Buzz: Okay.",
        "Alan: What was that about?",
        "Alexandra: Nothing.",
        "Alan: Well, Alexandra, I have some good news. You're a free woman.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: You think you know me so well.",
        "Sebastian: I know how much you want to get out of here. Or wasn't that you who just said you hated the way I've been treating you?",
        "Holly: Being locked up is not my idea of hospitality.",
        "Sebastian: Specialty of the house.",
        "Holly: Why don't you admit it?",
        "Sebastian: What?",
        "Holly: Your approach, these bars on the windows/gourmet dining is your way of trying to seduce me.",
        "Sebastian: Now there's a concept.",
        "Holly: You know my history. It stands to reason you'd give it a whirl, just to get my attention.",
        "Sebastian: Is it working?",
        "Holly: I'm not sure yet.",
        "Sebastian: (Sighs) pulling out all the stops, aren't you? Let's just say for the sake of argument that I am enjoying your company. Holly, right now, I have bigger fish to fry than you. Impending death has a way of making one focus on what's really important.",
        "Holly: So what's really important? Fighting off death or living while you can? I've seen you watching me when you think I'm not looking. You stare. You stare at my pictures, too.",
        "Sebastian: You noticed.",
        "Holly: I'm a journalist; I'm trained to notice things. Another thing I've noticed is that you want...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Hi.",
        "Edward: Hi.",
        "Cassie: Is that for me? \"To Cassie.\" Hm, must be me.",
        "Edmund: Well, it's supposed to be a surprise, I think.",
        "Cassie: Well, it's a surprise. Oh, I love it.",
        "Edmund: Do you?",
        "Cassie: Yes. You really want a baby, don't you?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I want what you want.",
        "Cassie: I was honest. Now it's your turn to tell the truth.",
        "Edmund: All right, all right. The idea of having a child with you... God, I would be... I would be the richest man in the world.",
        "Cassie: Wow. Hi.",
        "Edward: Hi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Taking a break?",
        "Coop: (Sighs) something like that. It's just been a long day.",
        "Buzz: (Laughs) any customers inside?",
        "Coop: Customers? (Laughs) no.",
        "Buzz: Good. I wouldn't mind one quiet night.",
        "Coop: Dad, you're not going to get it.",
        "Buzz: Why not?",
        "Coop: Do you remember that notebook of mine that you found? The one that had all the places that I've been to and the things that I've seen, all the places I want to go?",
        "Buzz: Oh, yeah, yeah.",
        "Coop: You leaned on me pretty hard the other night, you know, about taking off and going traveling again. As if you wanted to have me live my life and have fun, but you're saying this as if I can't do that here.",
        "Buzz: You can't live your life if you're handcuffed to a debt and your father's family feud.",
        "Coop: But that's life, too. You can't just wave a magic wand and expect all your problems to be gone.",
        "Buzz: Magic has nothing to do with this.",
        "Coop: You really want me to follow my dreams, don't you?",
        "Buzz: I would do anything to see them come true.",
        "Coop: I thought you'd say that.",
        "Buzz: Yeah.",
        "Coop: You know what? Do you want to go for a walk or maybe catch a movie or something?",
        "Buzz: You know what I'd like to do? You know what I'd like to do? I'd like to have a double espresso with my son, in my restaurant. Don't tell my doctor.",
        "Coop: Dad, wait a minute!",
        "Marina: This is so not cool.",
        "Lizzie: Mr. Cooper, I am so glad you're here.",
        "Buzz: Okay. What's going on?",
        "Marina: Grandpa, did you sell company to Phillip Spaulding?",
        "Buzz: Yeah, I did, but I never thought...",
        "Marina: I don't believe this.",
        "Coop: I do.",
        "Buzz: Yes, I sold company to Phillip, but I thought that since he died, that maybe it didn't go through.",
        "Lizzie: Well, see, I guess it did, because according to his will, I own it now. And I know how much you love this place, Buzz, I really do, so I was hoping you would stay on under me. What do you say?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Actually, no, this isn't for you. It's just... it's something I picked up for Tammy.",
        "Cassie: Maybe you should send it to her at general delivery.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, please.",
        "Cassie: Come on, Edmund. Why isn't she home? Can you tell me that? Why? I mean, at this rate, she's not even going to be home for Christmas.",
        "Edmund: First holidays first, please. Let's start with Thanksgiving.",
        "Cassie: I don't see her racing home to have turkey and pie with us.",
        "Edmund: But it may be the perfect time to reach out to her. Thanksgiving is about family, isn't it?",
        "Cassie: Which Tammy wants no part of right now.",
        "Edmund: Well, maybe I can get through to her.",
        "Cassie: I doubt it.",
        "Edmund: You mean you don't even want me to try?",
        "Cassie: No, I just... I just want it to work. I want her home.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I will get through to her. I will. I promise. I promise. Come here.",
        "Cassie: I love when you promise things to me. You know, you just calm me down and you make everything better.",
        "Edmund: Hey, I have something else to give you. Call it a little pre-holiday madness.",
        "Cassie: Oh?",
        "Edmund: Open it.",
        "Cassie: A daybook. For next year, thank you.",
        "Edmund: You've got to check this out. I've done something no man has ever done. I have written down all the important events throughout the year-- anniversaries, birthdays, family gatherings. There's only one occasion I couldn't write down.",
        "Cassie: What's that?",
        "Edmund: Our wedding, because I don't know the date.",
        "Cassie: Hint, hint, hint.",
        "Edmund: Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I'm counting on you to pick out the perfect date.",
        "Cassie: Let me see. I don't know. Next year is so busy, and it hasn't even started yet.",
        "Edmund: You see? We don't even have time to have a child, even if we wanted one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: (Groans in pain)",
        "Holly: Oh!",
        "Sebastian: Ow! Oh!",
        "Holly: Oh, Sebastian.",
        "Sebastian: Where the hell are they?",
        "Holly: What?",
        "Sebastian: As if you don't know. Michelle and Tony.",
        "Holly: Here. Have some more wine.",
        "Sebastian: I don't want more wine! I want to be cured! I had this all planned out. I just didn't anticipate people being stupid and lazy and not doing what they're supposed to do.",
        "Holly: Well, Ed's under quarantine. There's all that red tape. You have to just give it more time.",
        "Sebastian: I don't have time, Holly. I don't have any time! And the precious little of it I do, you're wasting, playing me, making me think that you care.",
        "Holly: Oh, but I do care.",
        "Sebastian: Only about getting out that door!",
        "Holly: That was before, but then I... I surprised myself.",
        "Sebastian: You did?",
        "Holly: What are you going to do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I was thinking that it needs a new look. Something hipper, more chic, you know?",
        "Marina: You mean trendy?",
        "Lizzie: Exactly. It needs a theme, like retro or macrobiotic.",
        "Buzz: Macrobiotic? I forget what that means.",
        "Lizzie: And the name? Company?",
        "Coop: Whoa, wait a minute. What is wrong with the name company?",
        "Lizzie: Well... well nothing. It just kind of sits there, you know. \"Company.\" I was thinking something jazzier, like, I don't know, Elizabeth and Company.",
        "Coop: That's it. I quit.",
        "Lizzie: Wait! Wait, wait. Just work with me here, okay? My dad wanted to see me run this place, not run it down the tubes, okay? This is a chance for the Spaulding's and the Coopers to finally do something positive together instead of fighting all the time. Besides, it's either that, or you're out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: They're really, really letting me out?",
        "Alan: The paperwork is being processed as we speak.",
        "Alexandra: How?",
        "Alan: Well, I've been speaking with the governor. He understands the toll that Phillip's death has played on our family, and he feels very strongly that you have paid your debt to society. So he's giving you a full pardon.",
        "Alexandra: It's a miracle. Oh, Alan, it's a miracle.",
        "Alan: No, Alexandra, it's not a miracle. It's my doing. Now I want you to tell me one thing: What was going on between you and Buzz right now? And don't say \"nothing.\"",
        "Alexandra: Oh. Come on, that's just the continued skirmish between the Spaulding's and the Cooper's. That's all.",
        "Alan: Yes, but it ended with the word \"okay.\"",
        "Alexandra: Well. Buzz just said he's willing to, you know, make a truce for the moment.",
        "Alan: A truce? Or was it a deal?",
        "Alexandra: Okay, what are you suggesting?",
        "Alan: Alexandra, I worked very hard to get you released from this jail because our family needs to be together to ensure that Phillip's name and reputation in this community is never forgotten.",
        "Alexandra: Here, here. I feel exactly the same way you do, Alan.",
        "Alan: Do you? Then you must never go against the best interest for this family. And don't get in the way of justice for me or for Phillip. Do you understand? Because remember, I got you your freedom, and I can take it away like that.",
        "Alexandra: Oh.",
        "Alan: Now, let's go home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: About the baby thing...",
        "Edmund: Cassie, Cassie, we don't have to go into that again. I think we understand one another perfectly. The important thing right now is I find Tammy, persuade her to come back here for Thanksgiving so we can figure out our wedding, all right? You do still want to get married to me, right?",
        "Cassie: More than ever.",
        "Edmund: Hm. Good answer. Sandy, it's Edmund. I have something to ask you, and you owe this family, so you'd better not say no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: (Groans)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: It sounds like you've got a lot of good ideas, and I appreciate the opportunity to stay on and pitch in, you know? I really do. Thank you.",
        "Lizzie: Well, you're welcome.",
        "Coop: Um, Dad? Are you okay?",
        "Buzz: Well, yeah. I think this could be a very productive relationship. I really do. Something wrong?",
        "Lizzie: No, I... for some reason, I just expected a fight, that's all.",
        "Marina: We can arrange that.",
        "Buzz: No, I believe in peaceful coexistence, and I think it's about time that the Cooper's and the Spaulding's buried the hatchet.",
        "Marina: Please say \"in her head.\"",
        "Lizzie: Great. I'm glad this is going to work out. Now, do you mind if I take a look at the kitchen?",
        "Buzz: Why would I mind? It's yours.",
        "Lizzie: Oh. Yeah, right. Okay. Thanks. Excuse me.",
        "Marina: What was that?",
        "Coop: That was just sweet and cordial. Why don't you just go ahead and kiss her...",
        "Buzz: Relax. The place is going to be ours again.",
        "Marina: Excusez-moi?",
        "Buzz: I sold the place to Phillip, true. But I didn't expect him to give it to his daughter. But that's not going to be a problem. She's not going to be able to hack it.",
        "Marina: And then she'll want to sell it back to us.",
        "Buzz: That would be a distinct possibility.",
        "Coop: I give her about a month.",
        "Marina: Oh, no. No, no, no. Five bucks says she doesn't last a week.",
        "Coop: Oh, five bucks? I say ten bucks.",
        "Buzz: Pikers. What about a hundred bucks. Come on.",
        "Coop: A hundred bucks. I'll take that.",
        "Buzz: A hundred bucks? What about 500 bucks? What about a thousand bucks?",
        "Coop: Now you're getting a little too out of my range here. Come on.",
        "Buzz: Would you excuse us, please? What are you doing here?",
        "Alexandra: I'm free Buzz. Free. And I'm never going back to that prison ever again, ever.",
        "Buzz: Neither one of us are going to have to go to prison.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Next, on \"Guiding Light\"...",
        "Alan: The killer will be punished? No. The only justice that will be served is the justice that I give out myself.",
        "Edmund: We're late.",
        "Cassie: We? Hey."
