        "Cassie: Claire, please don't beat around the \r\nbush. Tell us what's going on with Will. ",
        "Claire: I won't be able to make a definite \r\ndiagnosis until I run some more tests. ",
        "Richard: There's something you're not telling \r\nus. ",
        "Claire: Why don't we move this into my \r\noffice? ",
        "Cassie: It's okay. I think this is something \r\nwe all should hear. ",
        "Claire: All right. Thus far, the tests seem \r\nto indicate that Will has a rare liver dysfunction brought on by a nonspecific \r\nviral infection. ",
        "Cassie: Meaning what? ",
        "Claire: His liver is shutting down. \r\n",
        "Richard: Well, how could he have contracted \r\nsomething like that? I mean where... ",
        "Cassie: The airport. The airport. I should \r\nnever have taken him out of the country. ",
        "Claire: This is nothing you did, either one \r\nof you. This was caused by a virus. ",
        "Alonzo: You're talking, like, a cold or a \r\nflu, which means he'll get better, right? ",
        "Claire: No, this is very serious. I'm not \r\ngoing to pretend it's not. ",
        "Richard: Doctor, what is the next step? There \r\nis a cure, right? ",
        "Claire: Well, there are several courses of \r\ntreatment we can discuss, but... ",
        "Alonzo: But what? Just say it. ",
        "Claire: Will's liver is damaged and it's \r\npossible he won't respond. Now, if that's the case, I'm sorry, but there's very \r\nlittle else we can do. ",

        "\r\nHolly: Any sign of Lizzie and James? ",
        "Buzz: Rick and Harley are asking themselves \r\nwhere kids would go to play \"Hansel and Gretel,\" and Phillip and Beth are \r\nborderline hysterical. ",
        "Holly: Well, they haven't been gone that \r\nlong. Maybe they just wandered off the path a little bit. I hope. Buzz? Where \r\nare you going? ",
        "Buzz: I came to check on my grandson. \r\n",
        "Holly: He's fine. Sleeping like an angel.\r\n",
        "Buzz: I want to hold him; be grateful he's \r\nhere in my arms again. ",
        "Rick: James! ",
        "Phillip: Lizzie! ",
        "Rick: Lizzie! ",
        "Phillip: Lizzie, come on, honey! ",
        "Rick: This is ridiculous. You know, guys, \r\nwe're going to cover more ground if we split into pairs here. Okay? ",
        "Phillip: All right, that's a good idea. Why \r\ndon't you and Harley go that way, and Beth and I... ",
        "Rick: You and I can go... If you watch her, \r\nthe girls can go... ",
        "Phillip: It doesn't matter. I don't care. I \r\ndon't want to stay around and argue... ",
        "Harley: Whatever. The kids are probably \r\nfreezing. Let's just go. ",
        "Phillip: Fine. I'm going this way. Beth, why \r\ndon't you come with me? ",
        "Lorelei: Okay, that sounds... ",
        "Phillip: Lizzie! ",
        "Rick: Everything's going to be okay. \r\nEverything's going to be fine. ",
        "Lorelei: I don't doubt it for a minute.\r\n",

        "Reva: Hello? ",
        "Felicia: Hey. I've been trying to reach you \r\nfor hours. ",
        "Reva: Felicia? ",
        "Felicia: What are you doing out of the \r\nhospital? You have a concussion, Reva. You belong in bed. ",
        "Reva: You know, I'm getting so tired of \r\nhearing people say that to me. My head is fine, contrary to popular belief.\r\n",
        "Felicia: You told Josh, didn't you? I \r\nsuspected that's where you were going. ",
        "Reva: When I came home to deal with the \r\npainting he was here. I didn't have any choice. ",
        "Felicia: You told him you went back to Civil \r\nWar New Orleans? ",
        "Reva: I told him all of it, about Regina, \r\nGeneral Hudson. ",
        "Felicia: When you say \"all of it,\" do you \r\nmean... ",
        "Reva: I mean, I told him that I think Alan \r\nand Olivia are having an affair, just like Regina and General Hudson, and now he \r\nthinks I'm nuts, and he'd like nothing more than to see me committed to a \r\npsychiatric clinic. And you know something? Maybe he's right. ",
        "Felicia: What did Josh say? ",
        "Reva: After he looked at me like I was \r\ntotally insane? ",
        "Felicia: Reva, you are not. ",
        "Reva: Maybe I am crazy. Or deluded, or \r\nsomething. You know, maybe this is all one big fantasy. I mean, when people go \r\noff the deep end, they don't know it, right? Maybe they're too far gone, isn't \r\nthat it, to know the difference between realism and illusion. ",
        "Felicia: Do you really think that? \r\n",
        "Reva: No, but that's what you think, isn't \r\nit? I mean, if... if someone said the things to me that I've been saying to you \r\nand Josh... ",
        "Felicia: Reva, calm down. I want you to come \r\nand see me. I want to talk to you about this. ",
        "Reva: There's nothing left to talk about, \r\nbecause if Joshua doesn't believe me, if he's not on my side... He wants to have \r\nme committed, Felicia. He and Olivia are working together to put me away. \r\n",
        "Felicia: Reva, what are you talking about?\r\n",
        "Reva: There's nothing I can do to stop it. \r\nAnd maybe I don't even want to, anymore. I have to go. ",
        "Felicia: Reva, wait. Reva! (Sighs) \r\n",

        "\r\n(doorbell rings) (knocking) ",
        "Josh: Reva, are you in there? I have to talk \r\nto you. ",
        "Reva: I know why you're here. ",
        "Josh: Do you? ",
        "Reva: I ran into Olivia. She told me that you \r\nintend to put all of your resources and everything into the harbor project. \r\nWell? Is she right? ",
        "Josh: Yes, she is. What else did she tell \r\nyou? ",
        "Reva: She let me in on your little secret.\r\n",
        "Josh: What secret? ",
        "Reva: That you want to put me away, that you \r\nwant to have me committed. ",
        "Josh: Olivia told you that? ",
        "Reva: You know me better than anyone, Joshua. \r\nAnd if you think I need help, then maybe I do. Because I trust you, and I know \r\nthat you would never intentionally hurt me. ",
        "Josh: You're right. I would never \r\nintentionally hurt you. ",
        "Reva: Then if you think I need care, then \r\nmaybe I do. ",
        "Josh: I think going to a clinic would be the \r\nbest thing for you. ",
        "Reva: So you think I'm crazy. ",
        "Josh: I didn't say that. ",
        "Reva: You know, I was kind of hoping that \r\nsomehow, someone would believe me. I mean, I know I've been going on and on \r\nabout the Civil War and traveling in time, and I know how that must sound, but I \r\nwanted one person, I wanted just one person to... I wanted you to believe me.\r\n",
        "Josh: Reva, you didn't let me finish. I think \r\nit would be a good idea to tell people you're in a clinic, in case you're not \r\naround for the next few days. ",
        "Reva: What? ",
        "Josh: You see, the last time you disappeared, \r\npeople worried about you, especially Marah and Shayne, so I think you need a \r\nbetter story this time around. ",
        "Reva: Story? (Doorbell rings) ",
        "Josh: Wow. He's actually on time. Come here.\r\n",
        "Reva: Wait. Joshua, I... ",
        "Josh: Come here. ",
        "Billy: Hey, darling. You get your head \r\nexamined? ",
        "Reva: What's going on? ",
        "Billy: No, no, no. Little brother filled me \r\nin on everything, and I just got one question: Am I the brigadier general or am \r\nI the pony express guy? ",
        "Reva: (Laughs) Billy. ",
        "Billy: No, no, no, look. I thought you were a \r\nlittle wacky when I first heard the whole story, but I figured if I can believe \r\nin Santa Claus and the Easter bunny and the Chicago cubs, believing in you ain't \r\nsuch a hard stretch. Come here. ",
        "Reva: (Laughs) what would I do without you?\r\n",
        "Billy: Well, it sounds to me like you're \r\nabout to be shot, along with my little brother Jack, here. Now, if I'm Jill, I \r\ndon't want to know about it. (Laughter) ",
        "Reva: (Laughs) I haven't even seen you yet.\r\n",
        "Billy: Well, I'm probably a young soul, you \r\nknow. ",
        "Reva: You know, you're one of a kind. \r\n",
        "Billy: Oh, so are you, sweetie. Look, now, \r\nwhatever's going on, I'm behind you 150%. I have to leave right now, but I'll be \r\nthinking good thoughts. Get me a souvenir, okay? ",
        "Reva: Medal of honor. ",
        "Billy: Medal of honor. ",
        "Josh: I'm sure a t-shirt would be fine. Go, \r\ngo. ",

        "Harley: Lizzie! God, I feel like we've been \r\nsearching for miles. Where are they? ",
        "Rick: I don't know. You know, as much as I \r\nlove being a dad, I\u2019m beginning to see the other side of parenthood, you know? \r\nThe worry and the fear that something could happen, something completely and \r\ntotally out of your control. I mean, this is the way it's going to be for the \r\nrest of my life? ",
        "Harley: I'm afraid so. ",
        "Rick: Oh, great. No relief at all? \r\n",
        "Harley: Rick, I\u2019ll tell you, you love these \r\nkids, but along with that love comes this terror when you realize how completely \r\nvulnerable they are. ",
        "Rick: That's great. That's just great. \r\n",
        "Harley: Hey, you asked for this. ",
        "Rick: Yes, I did. Yes, I did. ",
        "Harley: Lizzie's a big girl. She's a very \r\nself-reliant kid. ",
        "Rick: Yeah, maybe so, but I mean, I can't \r\nimagine what Phillip and Beth are going through. I mean, what we're all going \r\nthrough. I just wish I could make the pain go away for all of us. ",

        "Lorelei: Hey, we're going to find them, we \r\nare, you know, because deep down inside I know that they're all right. And if \r\nthey were gone, I'd know that, too. ",
        "Phillip: Well, I'm glad you feel confident.\r\n",
        "Lorelei: I guess I just have faith. \r\n",
        "Phillip: After everything we've been through \r\nin the last few years? ",
        "Lorelei: Well, yeah, exactly. Exactly. I \r\nmean, after everything that's happened, and then we finally decide to go away as \r\na family, I just can't believe that God or fate, or whatever is ruling this \r\nuniverse, would be so cruel as to take that away. I just... I just don't believe \r\nit, you know. Lizzie? James? ",

        "\r\nCassie: I think we need to have a little faith, because I refuse to believe for \r\none minute that Will is not going to recover. That is inconceivable to me.\r\n",
        "Richard: Look, he was fine, you know, just a \r\nday ago. He wasn't sick at all. ",
        "Claire: The virus may have been there for \r\nsome time. ",
        "Richard: But there were no symptoms, there \r\nwere no signs. ",
        "Cassie: Maybe this just started. I mean, if \r\nthis is... ",
        "Claire: As I've said, we need to run some \r\nmore tests. Look, babies are strong. We never know exactly how they're going to \r\nrespond. ",
        "Richard: So he might recover? ",
        "Claire: He might. ",
        "Alonzo: But his chances aren't good? \r\n",
        "Claire: Not in this severe a case. Now, we'll \r\ntreat him symptomatically as long as we can, but the prognosis is not good.\r\n",
        "Alonzo: It doesn't make any sense. If you \r\ndon't have any faith in your methods, if you don't think they're going to work, \r\nthen why don't you find something else? ",
        "Cassie: There has to be an alternative, \r\nsomething beyond the conventional treatment. ",
        "Mel: There is. It's still experimental, but I \r\nthink it's worth a try. ",
        "Mel: I'm sorry for interrupting, but I've \r\nbeen studying Will's case. I'm talking about an LDLT. ",
        "Claire: This is Dr. Melissande Boudreau. And \r\nalthough I do appreciate her input, this case is somewhat out of her field of \r\nexperience. ",
        "Richard: If you don't mind, doctor, doctor, \r\nif you don't mind, I think we'd all like to hear what she has to say. \r\n",
        "Mel: Well, I'm sure Dr. Ramsey was about to \r\ntell you about it. ",
        "Claire: Dr. Boudreau is suggesting a live \r\ndonor liver transplant. ",
        "Cassie: A liver transplant. ",
        "Mel: One of the parents donates a part of his \r\nor her liver, which is then transplanted into the baby. If all goes well, both \r\nthe parent and the child regenerate a full liver within six to eight weeks.\r\n",
        "Claire: But it's high-risk surgery for the \r\nbaby, as any surgery would be for Will's age. We have to run a lot of additional \r\ntests, and it's not something to enter into lightly. ",
        "Alonzo: You mean Will could... ",
        "Claire: Yes, we could lose him. ",
        "Alonzo: But the other way, we lose him for \r\nsure, right? ",
        "Claire: No, not for sure, no. ",
        "Richard: Can't you, you know... Can't you \r\njust put him on medication for a while, see how he reacts. ",
        "Claire: Well, we could. The problem is his \r\nliver is deteriorating. I mean, if we treat him and if he doesn't respond, then \r\nit will be too late for the transplant. ",
        "Cassie: So we have to make this decision \r\nright now? ",
        "Claire: First we have to run some tests. We \r\nhave to find out which parent, if any, is compatible with Will. ",
        "Cassie: Does it have to be a parent? \r\n",
        "Mel: It's our best chance. ",

        "Harley: I... I know this isn't the right \r\ntime, but I just thought of something, and let me just say it really fast, okay? \r\nWhat you said before about feeling totally out of control, love making you feel \r\nthat way, maybe that applies to us, I mean, our friendship. ",
        "Rick: Meaning? I... What? ",
        "Harley: Meaning that maybe we're going about \r\nthis relationship thing the wrong way. ",
        "Rick: Now you tell me. ",
        "Harley: No, listen. Maybe... You know, we \r\nthink... We think that we have to make love to make this relationship into \r\nsomething. We're pushing it, you know what I mean? We're pushing it. Maybe we \r\nshould just get rid of all these ideas about what we should and shouldn't do.\r\n",
        "Rick: You're right. You're right. There you \r\ngo. I mean, is this your way of saying that we're not sharing the same bed \r\ntonight? (Laughs) ",
        "Harley: Listen, listen. Life happens, right? \r\nYou can't make it happen, it just happens. And we get along and we like each \r\nother and we're friends. And, hey, maybe we are supposed to be together and \r\nmaybe we're not, but we'll find that out. We should just... We should just let \r\nnature take its course. What? What... What's that for? ",

        "Phillip: I don't know what the hell you're \r\ntalking about, Beth, you're doing great. Not that long ago something like this \r\nhappened, you would've been in a million pieces over it. I don't think anybody's \r\ncut out for losing their children. ",
        "Lorelei: No, no. I meant, you know, being a \r\nmom. ",
        "Phillip: You're a great mom. ",
        "Lorelei: Yeah, but the kids are so much \r\ncloser to you. I mean, you're around them more. ",
        "Phillip: Since when? ",
        "Lorelei: Well, since... You know, since I \r\nmarried Edmund and went to San Cristobel, I mean. And you know, I made all those \r\nbad choices with men. That had to be hard on Lizzie and James. ",
        "Phillip: Come on, every parent goes through \r\nstuff, you know? ",
        "Lorelei: They do? ",
        "Phillip: Sure they do. You don't think I look \r\nin the mirror and wish I saw somebody else? ",
        "Lorelei: Who? ",

        "Josh: Billy looked into Olivia's cell phone \r\nrecords. She's made a whole lot of calls to Alan's private line at all hours of \r\nthe day-- and night. ",
        "Reva: Joshua, I am so sorry. Why anyone would \r\nchose Alan Spaulding. Whatever Alan promised Olivia, I hope she never gets it.\r\n",

        "Josh: Reva, I have to be honest with you \r\nhere. I don't know what to make of this story, I don't. I'm sorry. You're \r\ntalking about walking through a painting and traveling through time into the \r\npast.

        "Alonzo: Me? ",
        "Mel: If you're a match, we'll just remove 25% \r\nof your liver. Recovery time is five days. Of course, in all surgeries, there \r\nare risks. ",

        "Claire: Complications? ",
        "Alonzo: Yeah, when I was a teenager, I had \r\nappendicitis. When they knocked me out, my temperature had spiked and I almost \r\ndied. ",

        "Cassie: Usually? ",

        "Alonzo: So where does that leave us? \r\n",
