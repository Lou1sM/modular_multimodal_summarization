        "Danny: All right, bar looks good. I think \r\nwe're all set. Hey, did you double check all my place-setting skills? \n",
        "Michelle: Hm-mmm. Of course I did. \n",
        "Danny: You did, didn't you? ",
        "Michelle: And I fixed everything. ",
        "Danny: Ah, I knew you were going to do that.\r\n",
        "Michelle: So wait, we have enough chairs, \r\nright? We're 11. No... no, we're 12. We're 12 adults... ",
        "Danny: What about Ray? Did he call? \n",
        "Michelle: Um, Ray called. He's coming by \r\nlater after he goes to the shelter. ",
        "Danny: Okay. All right, well, just let me \r\nknow if there's anything else you want me to do. ",
        "Michelle: Okay. Hey. ",
        "Danny: What? ",
        "Michelle: Are you excited as I am? \n",
        "Danny: About what? ",
        "Michelle: \"About what?\" This is our first \r\nThanksgiving in our new house. ",
        "Danny: Yeah, I'm excited. Excited, I\u2019m \r\nexcited. I'm excited. I'm excited. ",
        "Michelle: (Laughs) ",
        "Danny: I'm excited. ",
        "Michelle: And did you bring me down the board \r\ngames for later? ",
        "Danny: I brought a couple of decks of cards.\r\n",
        "Michelle: No cards. We're not playing poker \r\ntonight. ",
        "Danny: Well, not till after the football.\r\n",
        "Michelle: The board games are up in the hall \r\ncloset. I'll go... ",
        "Danny: And that's where they're going to \r\nstay. ",
        "Michelle: Okay, you want to baste the turkey \r\nand bake the deviled eggs? ",
        "Danny: No. ",
        "Michelle: Because, you know, I'll go. It's up \r\nto you. ",
        "(Door slams) ",
        "Nico: Hey. ",
        "Michelle: Hey. ",
        "Danny: Hey. You took of early this morning. \r\nWhere'd you go? ",
        "Nico: Oh, yeah, I was helping Father Ray. \r\nIt's kind of what I'm used to doing today, but he actually told me to come by \r\nand give you guys a hand. ",
        "Michelle: Oh, and we are glad you did. \n",
        "Danny: Great. You can go upstairs and grab \r\nthe board games out of the hall closet. ",
        "Nico: Board games? ",
        "Danny: Board games. ",
        "Michelle: It's a Bauer tradition, okay? And \r\nit's going to be fun. You're going to have fun, both of you. ",
        "Danny: Oh, and after that, Michelle needs \r\nyour help in the kitchen. ",
        "Michelle: That's nice. That's nice... \n",
        "Danny: What? ",
        "Michelle: ...But you're not off the hook yet.\r\n",
        "Danny: Oh, I think I'm very much off the \r\nhook. ",
        "Michelle: No. You got a lot of work to do, \r\nbuddy. ",
        "Tony: Look who's here. ",
        "Danny: Hey, tiger... ",
        "Tony: Go see Daddy. ",
        "Danny: Wassup? Did you show your Cousin Tony \r\nyour new jungle gym? You did? (Laughs) ",
        "Tony: Oh, he did all right, that's for sure.\r\n",
        "Danny: You did? ",
        "Michelle: Oh, well, maybe all three of you \r\ncan go outside later. ",
        "Danny: Little monkey. ",
        "Tony: Yeah, sure, why not? After the game.\r\n",
        "Danny: After the game. ",
        "Michelle: Not you, too. Come on. ",
        "Danny: Why not? What's this? What's this? \r\nWhat's this? What's this? ",
        "Tony: We had fun, huh? ",
        "Bill: Hey, what's going on? ",
        "Michelle: Hi. ",
        "Eden: Hi. I... I didn't dare cook it. Maybe \r\nlater you can show me. ",
        "Michelle: Well, one of us will, I'm sure. \r\nThank you. ",

        "Reva: Oh, that is so pretty. ",
        "Marah: Thank you. Aren't we a little bit \r\nshort, though? ",
        "Reva: Uh, actually, Cassie and the kids \r\naren't coming. ",
        "Marah: Because of Edmund? ",
        "Reva: No, I mean I extended an invitation to \r\nhim, but Cassie decided that she wanted to start her own tradition, so it's just \r\nus, and Marina. ",
        "Marah: So I assume the extra setting is...\r\n",
        "Reva: Sandy. I mean, he said no, but I'm \r\nholding out hope that he'll change his mind. ",
        "Marah: You know what? Could I invite \r\nsomebody? ",
        "Reva: Well, yeah, of course. Sure, it's kind \r\nof last minute, though. ",
        "Marah: Yeah, well, the person I have in mind \r\ndoesn't have any family... ",
        "Reva: Well, then by all means, call him right \r\nthis minute. I mean, I'm assuming it's a him. ",
        "Marah: Yes. Uh, Jeffrey O\u2019Neill's room, \r\nplease. ",
        "Reva: Wait. Wait a minute. You're calling \r\nJeffrey O\u2019Neill? ",
        "Marah: Yeah. ",
        "Reva: Oh, my God. I thought Cassie was crazy.\r\n",
        "Marah: Cassie said something to you? \n",
        "Reva: Of course she did, Marah. So it's true. \r\nAre you interested in Jeffrey O\u2019Neill? ",
        "*\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *",
        "Buzz: Refill? ",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, please. ",
        "Buzz: Gee, you're practically a regular here. \r\nDinner last night; now breakfast. ",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, I didn't think you were open \r\ntoday. ",
        "Buzz: Charlie's idea. Cook. ",
        "Jeffrey: Fascinating. ",
        "Buzz: Well, he didn't have anyplace to go \r\nthis year, so... He asked me to keep the place open, you know, for guys like... \r\nhim. Guys like you. ",
        "*\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *",
        "Cassie: Okay, well, I need to go in and tell \r\nBuzz. Make sure he has everything set up, right? ",
        "Edmund: Set up? ",
        "Cassie: Yeah. I thought after the parade, we \r\ncould eat here. ",
        "Edmund: Huh. Well, I'm sorry, I\u2019m a bit \r\nconfused. I thought you'd be going over to your sister's with the kids. \n",
        "Cassie: Yeah, but I changed my mind. I guess \r\nI should have said something to you about it. ",
        "Edmund: Well, why didn't you? ",
        "Cassie: I don't know. I didn't want to make \r\nit an issue, you know? I want to spend the day with you, and I want you to feel \r\ncomfortable. And it doesn't really matter where we eat, right? ",
        "Edmund: Well, that's very nice, but today is \r\nabout family, Cassie, and I think you should be with yours. ",
        "Cassie: And I think that's really nice, but I \r\nalready made up my mind. ",
        "Edmund: Well, I think you're being somewhat \r\nstubborn. You should cancel your plans with Buzz and give your sister a call.\r\n",
        "Cassie: So you can be alone on Thanksgiving?\r\n",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I won't be here. As soon as \r\nthe parade's over, I'm catching a flight to San Cristobel. ",

        "Harley: (Sighs) Okay, you're not Harriet. \r\nYou're better than Harriet. You're a Butterball, and I\u2019m depending on you. Let's \r\ngo. \"Number one, preheat the oven.\" Done. \"Number two, remove the neck and \r\ngiblets.\" Done. \"Rinse the turkey.\" Done. Looking good. \"Rub butter into the \r\nskin.\" That's good. Beautiful. Oil. How much oil? Was that too much oil? Oh, \r\nwait, did I just ruin this thing? Mommy, why couldn't you just teach me to cook? \r\nOf course you couldn't teach me to cook; you didn't know how to cook either.\r\n",
        "Nadine: (Laughs) Oh, honey. Serving the \r\nfood was bad enough. But cooking it? Really, Harley. ",
        "Harley: This doesn't seem right. Shouldn't it \r\nbe more sticky? ",
        "Nadine: Did you follow the recipe? \n",
        "Harley: Yes. But I can't read Blake\u2019s \r\nwriting. She writes like a doctor. ",
        "Nadine: Blake Marler? There's your problem. \r\nShe can't cook. ",
        "Harley: It's her grandmother's recipe. Did I \r\nput enough sage in this thing? Wait, was I supposed to use sage? What recipe am \r\nI doing? ",
        "Nadine: Oh, honey, why on earth are you \r\ntorturing yourself like this? ",
        "Harley: I have no idea. ",
        "Nadine: Well, you must have some reason, \r\notherwise you could have just called Buzz. In fact... ",
        "Harley: A Greek Thanksgiving? I don't think \r\nso. No, I am on my own here. ",
        "Nadine: Oh. Well, I hope you have a backup \r\nplan. ",
        "Harley: You know, you're not supposed to say \r\nthat. First of all, you're in my head, so I get to write the script here. \n",
        "Nadine: Oh, and in your head, mothers are \r\nsupposed to be more supportive. ",
        "Harley: Yes. ",
        "Nadine: Well, did you ever hear that old \r\nsaying about how love is the most important ingredient in cooking? ",
        "Harley: You know what I\u2019m going to do? I'm... \r\nI'm just going to follow this recipe. This recipe. This recipe here. Word for \r\nword, okay? I'm going to do it and I\u2019m going to get through this. ",
        "Nadine: That's your common sense kicking in.\r\n",
        "Harley: If I had any common sense, I wouldn't \r\nbe doing this at all. ",
        "Nadine: Why is this meal so important to you, \r\nHarley? ",
        "Harley: Why is this meal so important to me? \r\nWhy is this meal so important to me? Because this is what I\u2019m supposed to be \r\ndoing. You know, I got a second chance at my life, to make my family my \r\nnumber-one priority. And what have I been doing? I have been immersing myself in \r\nmy relationship with Gus. I have been immersing myself in the agency. I'm the \r\nsame person I used to be. ",
        "Nadine: Aw, sugar, you're being way too hard \r\non yourself. ",
        "Harley: I'm glad to hear you say that, \r\nbecause maybe it means there's a little part of me that's thinking it. \n",
        "Nadine: That's right. Although you could \r\nspend a little bit more time with Franky. ",
        "Harley: You think? ",
        "Nadine: Hmm, I think you do. ",
        "Harley: I do. I do but let me just get \r\nthrough this first, okay? Let me just... let me do this and let me get it over \r\nwith. ",
        "Nadine: Okay. Oh, and honey, next year, \r\nseriously, think about a backup plan. ",
        "*\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *",
        "Cassie: You're going to San Cristobel on \r\nThanksgiving? ",
        "Edmund: Well, Cassie, Thanksgiving's an \r\nAmerican holiday. I'm not an American. I have business in San Cristobel. \n",
        "Cassie: You expect me to believe that you \r\nmade these plans without discussing them with me first? ",
        "Edmund: Oh, the arrogance of it. You just did \r\nthe same thing. ",
        "Cassie: My plans include you. ",
        "Edmund: Oh, you're right. Well, I'm sorry, \r\nI\u2019m sorry. I should have discussed it with your first; I didn't. ",
        "Cassie: Are you saying that it's too late?\r\n",
        "Edmund: Well, unfortunately, I think it is, \r\nyes. ",
        "Cassie: Oh, get out of here! You're making \r\nthis up. You don't have any plans. ",
        "Edmund: Cassie, don't be ridiculous. Of \r\ncourse I have plans. Spend time with your family... ",
        "Cassie: Well, I want you to know... Wait, \r\nReva invited both of us, you know. And I still turned her down. I told her that \r\nI wanted to start a new tradition, with you. ",
        "Edmund: You told her that? ",
        "Cassie: Yes, I told her that. Would I be \r\ntelling you that if I didn't tell her that? ",
        "Edmund: Well, I don't know. I don't know. \r\nMaybe you're trying to protect my feelings or something. (Laughs) ",
        "Cassie: Like you're trying to protect mine? \r\nYeah, that's what I thought. ",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I just didn't want to \r\nspoil... I don't-- I don't want to spoil the holiday for you and your kids.\r\n",
        "Cassie: Hey, don't you realize that you would \r\nbe spoiling it if you weren't here with us? ",
        "Edmund: Well, I guess... I guess... I guess \r\nI\u2019m staying put. ",
        "Cassie: You better. Let's go inside and get \r\nsomething warm to drink. ",
        "Edmund: Okay, lead the way. ",
        "Jeffrey: Happy Turkey Day. ",
        "*\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *",
        "Marah: Would you please give me the phone \r\nback? ",
        "Reva: Answer my question. Are you interested \r\nin Jeffrey O\u2019Neill? ",
        "Marah: What if I am? ",
        "Reva: He's old enough to be your father.\r\n",
        "Marah: Like that ever stopped you. \n",
        "Reva: Marah, I... I just don't see what the \r\ntwo of you have in common. ",
        "Marah: Who cares? What if that's not even \r\nwhat I\u2019m interested in? What if I just want to have a good time? ",
        "Reva: Okay, look, you're having a bit of a \r\nsetback when it comes to men, but I just don't want you to self-destruct! \n",
        "Marah: Oh, so that's what you think I'm \r\ndoing? ",
        "Reva: When it comes to self-destructive \r\nbehavior, I'm the pro. ",
        "Marah: Like mother, like daughter, right?\r\n",
        "Reva: You're smarter than I ever was. \n",
        "Marah: (Scoffs) That is so like you. Always \r\na little late to the game, right, Mom? ",
        "Reva: What? ",
        "Marah: Where were you when you should have \r\nbeen interested in my love life? \"Uh, Marah, you have a crush on your brother. \r\nMaybe you should rethink that, honey.\" ",
        "Reva: I made a mistake. ",
        "Marah: (Scoffs) \"I made a mistake.\" Reva \r\nShayne Lewis's motto, everybody. ",
        "Reva: I just think you're a little vulnerable \r\nright now, and that concerns me. ",
        "Marah: You know what? I am so tired of people \r\nsaying that to me. You can save your concern, all right? I don't need it. And I \r\ndon't need you harassing me about Jeffrey or any other guy I decide I want to \r\ndate. Do you understand? Are we clear? ",
        "Reva: Yeah. Yeah. Forget everything I said.\r\n",
        "Marah: Forgotten. ",
        "Reva: Where are you going? ",
        "Marah: I don't know. I am not in the mood for \r\na family dinner right now, and I don't want to ruin it for you. ",

        "Frank: Hey, Pop, what's... what's with Harley \r\ndoing this cooking thing all by herself this year? ",
        "Buzz: Beats me. She's got the guy. \n",
        "Frank: \"She's got the guy\"? ",
        "Buzz: I was just thinking about your mom. She \r\ncooked me a meal one time. ",
        "Frank: Hold on. Mom cooked you a meal? \n",
        "Buzz: Yeah, chicken a la... you know, \r\nCadillac, Edsel, Rolls... some damn car. And she was... she was so proud of it. \r\nI mean, she... she... said it was like the meal she cooked right after we got \r\nmarried, the first meal, you know, kind of rekindled feelings or something.\r\n",
        "Frank: Ah, yes. The \"Way to a Man's Heart is \r\nThrough his Stomach\" Routine. ",
        "Buzz: Yeah, but, Harley's got the guy. Maybe \r\nit's for us. ",
        "Frank: What? Why? She doesn't have to prove \r\nanything to us. ",
        "Buzz: Well, your sister almost got killed \r\nthis year. Kind of makes you rethink your priorities. ",
        "Gus: I warned you about it. Hey, what's \r\nhappening? How you doing? You ready to go? ",
        "Frank: Ah, we're waiting for Darci and... \r\nWhat are you guys doing here? ",
        "Gus: We're just wasting... We got to waste \r\ntime. ",
        "Buzz: Harley threw you out? ",
        "Gus: She's a little tense. ",
        "Frank: Oh, no, you know what that means. This \r\nis going to be one long night. ",
        "Alan: Not necessarily, Frank. She is \r\npreparing her macaroni and cheese, isn't she, guys? ",
        "Gus: Oh, I don't think so. ",
        "Alan: Well, I hope that's not true. \n",
        "Buzz: Here, here, for later. Hey, where is \r\nthe ice cream? ",
        "Frank: Hey, Pop, don't forget the baklava \r\nhere, right? Come on, sweetie, let's go. See you guys. ",
        "Gus: See if that doesn't work. ",
        "Alan: I just want you to know that I may have \r\nto leave early. I need to see Phillip in the hospital. ",
        "Gus: Oh, yeah, how's he doing? ",
        "Alan: Well, he's doing as well as can be \r\nexpected under the circumstances. But I want you to know another thing: That \r\nhe's having some tests done. ",
        "Gus: Okay, fine. That's good. I think you're \r\na coward. ",
        "Alan: Huh? ",
        "Gus: There's not going to be any macaroni and \r\ncheese there, so you're just probably going to just bolt, right? Just admit it.\r\n",

        "Eden: You know, I don't... I don't think that \r\nwould have worked. Besides, I don't think Marah would have come. ",
        "Michelle: Probably not. Do you know what \r\nhappened with them? ",

        "Edmund: Well, don't worry, Cassie. I'm not \r\ngoing to be skipping out on you. I'm not. And it's not because my meetings were \r\na ruse, as you so suspiciously imply. It's because I want to make you happy, I \r\ndo. ",
        "Cassie: You do make me happy. (Sighs) Happy \r\nand thankful, you know? I'm thankful that we have found this happiness together.\r\n",
        "Edmund: Well, today is the day to give thanks \r\nfor being happy, I guess. ",
        "Cassie: I'm thankful that you make me feel so \r\nsafe and protected. And every day when I wake up in your arms, the first thing I \r\nwant to do is just smile. ",

That's the thing \r\nabout holidays. We come together and we're able to remember what's important in \r\nlife. We may even go out of our way to do something special for others, because \r\nthat's what it's all about, right? Doing good and making a difference. Giving \r\nsomething of ourselves even when we don't think there's anything left to give. \r\nAnd loving each other always, no matter what. So, on behalf of Michelle and \r\nRobbie, I just want to thank all of you for being here with us today on this \r\nvery special day. And we wish you great health, much happiness and lots of love. \r\nHappy Thanksgiving, everybody. ",
