        "Richard: Any word on Will or Alonzo? \r\n",
        "Cassie: Not since you left to give blood. I \r\njust wish someone would come out and tell us what's going on. ",
        "Richard: Dr. Ramsey said it's going to take \r\nsome time. ",
        "Cassie: She also said that the liver graft is \r\na complicated procedure, and Will, he's so weak, and with Alonzo's condition...\r\n",
        "Richard: There's a lot to worry about. I'm \r\nafraid as difficult as it sounds, all we can do right now is wait. ",
        "Cassie: Wait. And pray that nothing goes \r\nwrong. ",

        "\r\nLorelei: The kids okay? ",
        "Harley: Well, mine are asleep. And Lizzie and \r\nJames are entertaining Holly with the story of their \"Hansel and Gretel\" \r\nescapade. Where's my father? ",
        "Buzz: Right here. Rick and Phillip aren't \r\nback yet? ",
        "Harley: No, no. What is all this. ",
        "Lorelei: It's grub. ",
        "Buzz: While you were upstairs taking care of \r\nthe kids, Beth and I suddenly realized that... ",
        "Lorelei: That we hadn't eaten all day, and \r\nhey, you know me, I'd have to be pretty worried to forget about food, huh.\r\n",
        "Harley: Actually, you used to eat like a \r\nbird, but okay. ",
        "Lorelei: So, Buzz, you get all the fixings \r\nfor that chili? ",
        "Buzz: Sure do. I got it here. ",
        "Lorelei: Great. Cornbread? ",
        "Buzz: Yes, ma'am. ",
        "Lorelei: Okay. Well, this is turning into a \r\nreal celebration, huh? You know, I am just so darn happy that those kids are \r\nback that I just want to share it with... Hey. Hey, why don't you invite Frank \r\nup, and Rick's family, too, huh? ",
        "Harley: That's actually a pretty interesting \r\nidea. ",
        "Buzz: Oh, yeah. The more the merrier. Let's \r\njust totally ruin my romantic weekend with Holly. ",
        "Harley: Dad. Just let it go. The weekend is \r\nalready blown, and Beth actually has a pretty good idea here, I think. You don't \r\nhear me say that too often. We have a reason to celebrate: The kids. ",
        "Lorelei: That's the spirit. ",
        "Harley: Yeah. ",
        "Lorelei: Hey, come on, you know, just... I'll \r\nchop what needs chopping. Come on, handsome, go on. I'm going to turn up the \r\nmusic. ",
        "Harley: Just a little. ",
        "Lorelei: And Phillip and Rick had better get \r\nback here soon or they're just going to miss all the fun. ",
        "Harley: Phillip and Rick. Phillip and Rick-- \r\nwhere are they? ",

        "\r\nPhillip: I can't believe we're lost. ",
        "Rick: Neither can I. Hey... hey! We agree on \r\nsomething! What are you doing? What are you doing? ",
        "Phillip: I'm calling Beth. ",
        "Rick: We're men. We cannot admit to a woman \r\nwe're lost. ",
        "Phillip: Rick, I am so tired, I have no \r\npride. ",
        "Rick: Oh, great. In that case... Oh, this is \r\ngreat. My phone's dead, too. ",
        "Phillip: Doesn't matter; I have a signal. \r\nBeth? ",
        "Lorelei: Phillip, is that you? ",
        "Phillip: Uh, yeah. Beth, I... ",
        "Lorelei: Hold on a minute, let me turn down \r\nthe music. ",
        "Phillip: Listen, I got a bad signal here. Oh, \r\ndamn it. ",
        "Rick: Oh, well, they don't call it the \r\nboonies for nothing. Why don't you move over here? Try it over here. ",
        "Phillip: Shh. Beth. ",
        "Lorelei: Phillip, I can hardly hear you.\r\n",
        "Phillip: Yeah, I know. I can't hear you well, \r\neither. We have a bad signal. Damn it. ",
        "Rick: Would you just move over here. \r\n",
        "Phillip: Would you be quiet? ",
        "Rick: You're not getting a signal there.\r\n",
        "Phillip: The phone says I have a signal, \r\nRick. ",
        "Rick: The phone is lying. The first time you \r\ngot through to Beth, you were standing right here. ",
        "Phillip: Yes. Why do you think I moved from \r\nover there, Rick? Because the signal was breaking up. ",
        "Rick: It was breaking up, but at least you \r\nhave a signal. Over there it's dead as a doornail. ",
        "Phillip: Shut up. ",
        "Rick: Phillip, would you please just move \r\nover here. ",
        "Phillip: Rick. Rick. ",
        "Rick: Give me the phone, I'll tell you what \r\nI'm talking about. Will you stop being stupid. (Struggling) nice job. You are \r\nreally unbelievable. ",
        "Phillip: Idiot! ",
        "Rick: Great job. ",
        "Phillip: Oh, that's good, Rick. That's good. \r\nYou know how the phone wasn't working very well over here? Well, now it's not \r\nworking at all. ",

        "\r\nPhoebe: I guess you'll have to wait until dinner to meet the children. Master \r\nRupert, he's a handful. Miss Esme, she's all right. Did you just make the \r\ncrossing? From the states? ",
        "Reva: Uh, uh-huh. Phoebe, this painting... \r\nWhere did you get it? ",
        "Phoebe: That one. It's been in the house \r\nsince I come here. ",
        "Reva: Mm. Why doesn't it hang on the wall?\r\n",
        "Phoebe: Because the mistress, she's having it \r\nfixed. Restored, she says. It's old. I think it's from America someplace. \r\n",
        "Reva: I'm so thirsty. Would you mind terribly \r\ngetting me something to drink. A soda would be fine. ",
        "Phoebe: A soda? Ah, a soda water. ",
        "Reva: (Laughs) yeah, a soda water. \r\n",
        "Phoebe: I'll get it myself. You sit and rest.\r\n",
        "Reva: Okay. I've got to get... I've got to \r\nget back to Jack before it's too late. Oh. Oh! ",
        "John: Well, now. What's your hurry, lass?\r\n",
        "Reva: Joshua? ",
        "Phoebe: John! There's a servant's entrance \r\nfor a reason. Sir Arthur will have your head. ",
        "John: And who will tell him, fair Phoebe? \r\nHmm? Not I. Will you, miss? ",
        "Phoebe: Give me those, and get your muddy \r\nboots off me carpet. ",
        "John: John Macgregor at your service, ma'am. \r\nI'm the gameskeeper here at Thornwood. You must be the new governess. \r\n",

        "Reva: It's Reva. Reva Shayne. ",
        "John: Oh, another American import to the \r\nManor, though not quite as formal as the first. Were you a governess in America, \r\nas well? ",
        "Reva: Yes, I was, among other things. Mr. \r\nMacgregor, have you worked here long? Mr. Macgregor? ",
        "John: Aye. I'm sorry for staring, ma'am, but \r\nthe strangest feeling just came over me. You seem so familiar, as if I've stood \r\nin this very spot with you before and gazed into your eyes. Have we met before?\r\n",

        "Josh: Well, I didn't offer to take her, and \r\nshe didn't ask. I think she really understands now that this is... It's over, \r\nyou know, this codependency we've had, whatever you want to call it, it's done. \r\nShe's on her own now. Wow. Boy, you know, I didn't mean to make that sound so \r\ncold. It's not that I want to turn my back on Reva, I just want to... \r\n",
        "Olivia: You just want to maintain a healthy \r\nbalance, maybe give other aspects of your life their proper due. ",
        "Josh: Yeah. Like you. ",
        "Olivia: She's always been between us, Josh, \r\nwhether you knew it or not. ",
        "Josh: Well, that's done. It's over. A whole \r\nnew chapter now we're writing. Right now I want to focus on other things-- on \r\nour marriage and on the business. ",
        "Olivia: Making the harbor project a huge \r\nsuccess. ",
        "Josh: Yeah, well, that's just the first step.\r\n",
        "Olivia: Really? ",
        "Josh: Mm, yeah. Really. Hey, look, you've \r\nbeen talking to me about taking more risks, right? ",
        "Olivia: Uh-huh. ",
        "Josh: Smart risks. Well, I've heard what \r\nyou've been saying and so has Billy. ",
        "Olivia: What does that mean? ",
        "Josh: We're working on a little something on \r\nthe side. In fact, Billy's on the horn right now, he's trying to make it happen.\r\n",

        "Josh: No, ma'am. No, I'm not going to tell \r\nyou about it. I'll tell you what, I'll give you a hint, though, okay? If... if \r\nthis deal works out how I expect, everyone involved in the harbor project will \r\nget exactly what they deserve, and then some. ",
