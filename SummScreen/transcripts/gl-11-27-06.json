        "Reva: Okay, that about wraps it up. Let's leave.",
        "Lizzie: It's my water.",
        "Reva: No more toasts, no more toast.",
        "Lizzie: No, no, water.",
        "Alan: Sweetheart, I'll get you some.",
        "Lizzie: No, no, it's my water. My water broke!",
        "Reva: Your water broke? She's going into labor.",
        "Jonathan: Here we go.",
        "Lizzie: No, no, no. This isn't happening. This can't be happening. It's weeks early. It's too early.",
        "Reva: It's okay.",
        "Alan: I'll have Bruno bring the car around.",
        "Reva: It's okay. Women have babies early all of the time.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, but I'm not ready for this. I was going to get my hair done and a pedicure.",
        "Reva: Lizzie!",
        "Lizzie: I haven't even shaved my legs!",
        "Reva: Your doctor's not going to mind. Look, first-time babies take a while to come. We have time.",
        "Lizzie: How long?",
        "Reva: Dylan was 36 hours.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, my God.",
        "Reva: It's okay. We'll get your bag.",
        "Lizzie: My bag. My bag's not here. It's not here! I left it at home. This isn't supposed to be happening today.",
        "Reva: Calm down. I'll get your coat.",
        "Lizzie: This isn't supposed to be happening today. Where's Jonathan! Ow!",

        "Josh: How's the bird?",
        "Cassie: Hey. I think it's looking good, don't you?",
        "Josh: Nice.",
        "Cassie: Hey, Happy Thanksgiving.",
        "Josh: Yeah, it will be. The first of many for us, I think.",
        "Cassie: Would you grab me the baster? I think I left it over by the sink.",
        "Josh: Yeah, no problem. (Laughter)",
        "Cassie: I'm sorry the veterans couldn't make it.",
        "Josh: Well-- oh, here it is. There's always next year. There you go.",
        "Cassie: (Laughing) Right next to me. Yeah, I just... I don't know. It's going to be fine. You know, it's going to be fine, even without--",
        "Josh: Everybody?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. It is getting kind of late. Do you think they're going to make it?",
        "Josh: You mean Billy, Reva or Jonathan?",
        "Cassie: All of the above.",
        "Josh: You don't?",
        "Cassie: I don't know. All I know is that when I woke up this morning, a little part of me wished they wouldn't because I'm pretty drama'ed out.",
        "Josh: Well, I certainly understand that feeling. But, we all have to be together tonight, all of us.",
        "Cassie: I know. And I do miss my sister.",
        "Josh: I'm sure Reva and Jonathan will be here.",
        "Cassie: You think?",
        "Josh: Yes. Hey, it's Thanksgiving, right? And we're a family. Come here. Come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "R.J.: I need your help.",
        "Tammy: What's up, R.J.?",
        "R.J.: Mom said I could say grace this year, but I don't know how.",
        "Tammy: Well, just think about whatever your thankful for and say whatever comes out.",
        "R.J.: That's it?",
        "Tammy: Yeah, nothing to it.",
        "Marah: Especially this year.",
        "Tammy: You know you have a lot to be thankful for, your mom.",
        "Marah: I know.",
        "Tammy: Maybe they're just running late.",
        "Josh: Hey, guys, we're going to hold off on dinner until Reva and Jonathan get here, okay?",
        "R.J.: I'm starving.",
        "Josh: It won't be that long, pal. I promise.",
        "Marah: Have they called?",
        "Josh: No, I'm just guessing they're having a hard time getting here because of the snow.",
        "Marah: Or maybe Mom doesn't want to come and spend Thanksgiving with her husband and another woman.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Where is Jonathan? I need him, Reva.",
        "Reva: We'll find him. Let's just get you ready. Here.",
        "Alan: Bruno's having to dig the car out of the snow, but it should have been in the garage. It'll only take him a minute.",
        "Lizzie: Well, we... we have to get to the hospital.",
        "Reva: We have time. We have time.",
        "Lizzie: Granddad, did you see Jonathan out there?",
        "Alan: What, he's gone?",
        "Reva: He stepped out!",
        "Alan: Why am I not surprised!",
        "Reva: Alan, don't! Stop it!",
        "Alan: We're not going to wait for him, Reva.",
        "Reva: He didn't just leave. (Car tires screeching)",
        "Jonathan: You ready, Lizzie? Let's go have this baby.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, no! Don't pick me up! No!",
        "Jonathan: Come on, come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Hey, Billy.",
        "Billy: Hey, what's up, Doc?",
        "Rick: Oh, yeah, like I've never heard that one before. Whatever you have on tap sounds good to me. What's the score?",
        "Billy: Dallas is up by three.",
        "Rick: Oh.",
        "Billy: Have you been to a meeting lately?",
        "Rick: Club soda and some pretzels. If you've got it.",
        "Bill: Okay.",
        "Rick: Boy, this place is like a ghost town.",
        "Billy: Yeah. Well, it's Thanksgiving. Don't eat too much because your wife will have your head.",
        "Rick: Yeah, my wife. Yeah, my wife took my little girl to her parents' house and I wasn't invited. It's okay. I spent a couple hours at the clinic, and I'm sure I'll get paged by the hospital on a night like this. There's a good call.",
        "Billy: Just doing my job.",
        "Rick: Oh, that, no. I was talking about the football game, Billy. The ref made a good call. I drove by the house.",
        "Billy: Mel's parents?",
        "Rick: Yeah. I mean I don't even know why I bothered because I didn't even stop. So, what about you, what's your excuse?",
        "Billy: I wasn't invited to Mel's parents either.",
        "Rick: (Laughs)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Ooh, I'll take an action figure if you're in the generous mood.",
        "Marina: (Laughs) Too late. I already got you your gift.",
        "Coop: Too late...? Marina, it's Thanksgiving, you've already got all of your Christmas shopping done?",
        "Marina: Yes, I know. It's been a slow night. And thank you so much. Uncle Henry, you shouldn't have.",
        "Coop: I know I shouldn't have, but I kind of had too. Frank and dad are passed out asleep-- probably dead because of the football game.",
        "Marina: (Laughs) They're dead because our team won.",
        "Coop: That's true. That's true.",
        "Marina: I was counting on you to bring over something tonight to eat. That's why I laid off the doughnuts the guys left in the room.",
        "Coop: Oh.",
        "Marina: So, can you stick around or do you have to get back to Ava?",
        "Coop: Well, you know, Ava's back doing dishes where she should be, you know. Just kidding. No, she said that I can go ahead and take as much time as I want. So I can, uh... stay with you.",
        "Marina: Oh, I love that girl. You know, it's turned out to be a pretty good Thanksgiving.",
        "Coop: It has. It has, which is kind of weird. It's kind of like a turnaround for the Cooper's, you know? Things are getting better. People are starting to actually be happy.",
        "Marina: Shh!",
        "Coop: What?",
        "Marina: Don't say that too loud, unless you want a brick to fall on your head or a Spaulding to show up and mess it all up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: This farmhouse is a great place for Thanksgiving, don't you think? Especially in the snow.",
        "Marah: Not as nice though as Cross Creek.",
        "Josh: Okay. Yeah, did you see the decorations that R.J. did out by the barn?",
        "Marah: I should call Mom.",
        "Josh: Okay, Marah, please don't ruin it for her.",
        "Marah: So this is all about Cassie, huh?",
        "Josh: Don't ruin it for all of us, or for yourself. This is a very important night. It's a chance for us to prove we're still a family.",
        "R.J.: Hey, Marah, did you miss Thanksgiving when you were in Paris?",
        "Marah: I still miss it.",
        "Tammy: Remember, it's your house.",
        "Cassie: Things will pick up once everyone gets here.",
        "Tammy: Oh, yeah, I'm sure.",
        "Cassie: We're going to have a good Thanksgiving if it kills me.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, well it just might. You and Josh.",
        "Cassie: Hey, go throw these at your cousin for me.",
        "Tammy: Here.",
        "Marah: Thanks. You want?",
        "Tammy: No, I'm good. Thanks.",
        "Marah: Dad?",
        "Josh: No, thank you. In fact, we're going to eat pretty quick.",
        "R.J.: I'll give thanks for that. (Laughter)",
        "Cassie: Wine?",
        "Josh: So, Marah, do you remember-- thank you. Do you remember that Thanksgiving-- you were pretty young, actually-- it snowed for several days in a row and we couldn't get to the store, and I think we ended up eating leftover chicken.",
        "Marah: And frozen french fries.",
        "Josh: That's right.",
        "Marah: Instead of mashed potatoes. I remember Uncle Billy said that that was what the pilgrims and Indians really wanted to eat on the first Thanksgiving together.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, that sounds like Billy.",
        "Marah: And then we watched all of the holiday movies on TV.",
        "Tammy: The same ones every year.",
        "Marah: Oh, yeah, with popcorn. And Grandpa Hawk used to cry at the end of all of the sentimental ones.",
        "Josh: That's right, he did.",
        "Marah: Mom always loved that part. She always ended up in your arms on the couch.",
        "Josh: Marah.",
        "Marah: Why didn't we do Thanksgiving at Cross Creek this year? You brought it all the way up here.",
        "Josh: Because it's not mine anymore.",
        "Marah: It's still Mom's. There are so many memories in that place. She almost died. Why did you have to change everything on her?",
        "Tammy: Her or you?",
        "Marah: Come on, Tammy, you know this is messed up.",
        "Cassie: Tammy, why don't you come help me in the kitchen?",
        "Tammy: No. Seriously, Marah, just give it up. Did you really think that this would be some happy, normal Thanksgiving? Look, I know that you wish your parents were still together, but they aren't. Your dad is with my mom now, and they're happy. So be happy for them or give it up.",
        "Cassie: Honey, it's okay.",
        "Tammy: No, it's not okay. You invite her into your home, and then all she does is make you feel uncomfortable.",
        "Cassie: Well, you know, this is a lot for her to deal with.",
        "Marah: Hmmm? Yeah, you think? I haven't even been gone that long, and my dad is with my aunt and my cousin's with my brother. (All talking)",
        "Tammy: Okay, I can't even believe...",
        "Josh: Marah, let's... step outside for a minute.",
        "Marah: No, no, no, Dad. You know you guys are wrong together.",
        "Josh: I just want to step outside.",
        "Marah: No, you all know it's wrong.",
        "Tammy: You don't know anything.",
        "R.J.: Can't we just eat?",
        "All: No!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Easy, easy, just keep breathing.",
        "Alan: You drove up my lawn?",
        "Reva: Alan, please.",
        "Alan: No, no, Elizabeth's not going with you. She's going with my driver.",
        "Reva: No, your driver isn't even here, Alan.",
        "Jonathan: Are you okay?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, it hurts.",
        "Reva: That's good.",
        "Jonathan: Don't worry we're going.",
        "Reva: Just keep breathing.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, get out of that car.",
        "Jonathan: It's my wife, it's my daughter, just leave it alone.",
        "Reva: Go, go, I love you. I love you. Drive carefully, okay. We'll meet you at the hospital.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Hey.",
        "Rick: Hey. Thanks.",
        "Billy: Leftovers are the best part of Thanksgiving.",
        "Rick: Spoken like a couple of guys without dinner reservations.",
        "Billy: Oh, I had an invite. I just... have a bar to run.",
        "Rick: An empty, very empty bar, Billy.",
        "Billy: You're here.",
        "Rick: Yeah, I'm here... I'm here because I got a new ticker when the old one stopped. That's why I'm here.",
        "Billy: It sounds to me like something to be thankful for.",
        "Rick: Well, you'd know Billy. I mean, you spent the last couple of months preparing for a death that didn't happen.",
        "Billy: Reva was the one who was dying.",
        "Rick: Billy, it doesn't matter. You were there for her. You had to get ready for it. Right?",
        "Billy: Eat your sandwich.",
        "Rick: My time was running out. I said all of my big good-byes, I was ready to go.",
        "Billy: Then you came back, right?",
        "Rick: How do you top the big good-bye, Billy, when you come back? I'll tell you something, I've completely wasted my second chance.",
        "Billy: Well, I prayed like heck for a miracle to save Reva, and then she got saved.",
        "Rick: But you feel like you've lost her, right, Billy? You know, I don't know what Reva's going to do with her second lease on life, but Billy, if I were you and I had some family that wanted me to join them at their Thanksgiving table, I'd be there. (Beeper beeping) See, it's the hospital.",
        "Billy: You'd go, even if it hurt like hell?",
        "Rick: Yep. It beats going cold turkey, Billy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "R.J.: Why is everyone mad?",
        "Cassie: No one is mad, honey. We're just hungry.",
        "Tammy: I'm mad.",
        "Cassie: Tammy.",
        "Tammy: What, this isn't working.",
        "Cassie: Everyone has got it out of their systems now.",
        "Tammy: Well, everyone is not here.",
        "Cassie: Josh says they'll be here. They'll be here.",
        "Tammy: I wanted this to work for you, Mom. It's just too soon, okay? Maybe next year. (Knock on door)",
        "R.J.: They're here!",
        "Remy: Hey, R.J., Happy Thanksgiving. I'm a little early.",
        "Tammy: It's okay.",
        "Cassie: Remy, hi. Happy Thanksgiving.",
        "Remy: Hi, Happy Thanksgiving.",
        "Cassie: Thank you. I'm glad you're here. You know, we haven't started yet, still waiting on some people. It's perfect.",
        "Remy: Thanks, Cassie, but I'm on duty.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, Remy told me I could do a ride-along.",
        "Cassie: You're leaving?",
        "Tammy: I felt bad that he had to work the holiday alone.",
        "Cassie: Excuse me, we're just going to check on the turkey.",
        "Tammy: But we just... okay.",
        "R.J.: They're having a bad day.",
        "Remy: Yeah, I'm getting that.",
        "Cassie: You can't leave; it's Thanksgiving.",
        "Tammy: You're letting all of the heat out.",
        "Cassie: And I don't want you on the roads tonight. It's dangerous.",
        "Tammy: Looks like it's almost done.",
        "Cassie: And Reva's going to want to see you when she gets here.",
        "Tammy: Mom... I don't think I can do this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: You're not helping.",
        "Marah: Dad...",
        "Josh: Marah, you're not helping. You hurt Tammy's feelings and you hurt Cassie's feelings.",
        "Marah: I'm sorry.",
        "Josh: Marah, do you honestly think that if you make this difficult for everybody that somehow that's going to send me running back into your mom's arms?",
        "Marah: No.",
        "Josh: I was really looking forward to tonight, having Thanksgiving with my daughter.",
        "Marah: Why do I feel like I'm the only grownup here?",
        "Josh: Excuse me?",
        "Marah: You're all way too busy trying to pull off this happy little family that you're forgetting everything that is happening. Mom still has a long road ahead of her. She isn't better yet.",
        "Josh: Look, I realize that you're trying to protect your mom. I get that, okay?",
        "Marah: No, no, I'm trying to protect you, Dad. Because if something happens to her, if she gets sick again and you're not there, I don't think you could forgive yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: We had a bag packed at the house, but I'd rather just go straight to the hospital.",
        "Alan: Can I help in any way?",
        "Reva: Yeah, you throwing yourself under my son's car out there would have been a big help.",
        "Alan: Reva, can we try to get along for the child's sake? It's Thanksgiving. I'm offering you an olive branch.",
        "Reva: No, actually you're not. You hate Jonathan; you're using Lizzie to get to their baby. The only branch you're offering is poison ivy.",
        "Alan: The only thing I want is to be a part of that little girl's life.",
        "Reva: Yeah. I'm so glad I'm going to get a chance to see little Reva myself.",
        "Alan: Little what?",
        "Reva: Yeah. Jonathan whispered it in my ear as they were pulling away.",
        "Alan: I won't allow it!",
        "Reva: Ah, there's that Alan I know and love. Will you try your driver again, please?",
        "Alan: So they're not really going to name it little Reva?",
        "Reva: No, but if I would have had kicked, they might have done in my honor.",
        "Alan: Over my dead body.",
        "Reva: No, mine.",
        "Alan: This is going to be a long rest of my life.",
        "Reva: I have a lot of faith in those kids.",
        "Alan: In my Elizabeth?",
        "Reva: Yes, I'm really warming up to her. She's trying very hard and she loves that baby.",
        "Alan: Well, I'm glad that you see that.",
        "Reva: Now, if you'd just give Jonathan a chance...",
        "Alan: I'd regret it.",
        "Reva: Damn it, Alan, he's going to be a better father than you ever were.",
        "Alan: There's that Reva I know.",
        "Reva: (Laughs)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Car revving)",
        "Lizzie: What? What happened?",
        "Jonathan: We're stuck in the snow, but I'll get us out.",
        "Lizzie: Stuck? Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie, don't freak out on me.",
        "Lizzie: It's supposed to be a shortcut.",
        "Jonathan: It is, it's just not plowed right.",
        "Lizzie: (Screaming) Get us out of here!",
        "Jonathan: Okay, are you doing your breathing thing?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, you mean that thing you missed when you ditched me at the birthing class?",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie, I'm trying.",
        "Lizzie: (Screaming) Get us out of here.",
        "Jonathan: All right, I'm not going to let anything happen to you or the baby, okay? So just do your breathing, okay, or whatever. Call 911 just in case.",
        "Lizzie: I don't have my bag.",
        "Jonathan: Here. Here, here, here, here, here. Here, okay? I'll be right back.",
        "Lizzie: Do you mean it?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I'm just going to get out and push the car.",
        "Lizzie: No, the thing that you said earlier about not letting anything bad happen to us. Because if I was you and this baby wasn't inside me, I would be scared enough to take off.",
        "Jonathan: You want me to get us out of here or no? (Car honking)",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie, Lizzie, are you okay?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I think so, yeah.",
        "Jonathan: The baby?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, we're both okay.",
        "Jonathan: Can you... can you move?",
