        "Olivia: (Laughs) What? ",
        "Josh: I can't... I can't do this. ",
        "Olivia: Why, what's wrong? ",
        "Josh: This is. This is wrong, I'm sorry.\r\n",
        "Olivia: Don't you want to be with me? \r\n",
        "Josh: Yes. Yes, of course I want to be with \r\nyou, just not here. This is Reva's house. ",
        "Olivia: Oh. Oh, okay, I just figured, you \r\nknow, she's not... She's away, and she's not going to walk in the door or \r\nanything like that. ",
        "Josh: Yeah. ",
        "Olivia: And, this is, you know, this is your \r\nhouse, too, sort of. ",
        "Josh: Yes, but you know, my son still lives \r\nhere. ",
        "Olivia: All right, all right. Maybe it's a \r\nlittle naughty, but isn't that what makes it fun? Besides, I can't help myself. \r\nI mean, ever since you decided to support me and put all your money into this \r\nproject, it's just made me want you all the more. Trust is a very sexy thing.\r\n",
        "Josh: Mmm... Someone's here. Hi. ",

        "Josh: Hey, hi. ",

        "Josh: Your mom asked me to... Your mom asked \r\nme to stop by and check up on you. Both of you, I guess. ",
        "Marah: Dad, I live in a dorm, remember? I \r\ndon't exactly need checking up on. Shayne's not really teething either, so \r\nwhat's going on? ",
        "Shayne: Yeah, is something wrong? Where's \r\nmom? ",
        "Josh: Uh, she... she had to go away. \r\n",

        "\r\nArthur: Well, well, well. You must be the new governess from America. \r\n",
        "Reva: Alan. ",
        "Arthur: Arthur-- Sir Arthur Thornwood. And \r\nthis is your young charge, Rupert. ",
        "Rupert: You are governess only to my sister. \r\nI am much too old to need one. ",
        "Reva: Well, I'll try to remember that, \r\nRupert. Maybe we can be friends. ",
        "Rupert: Perhaps. Have you seen Tabitha?\r\n",

        "Rupert: Yes. ",
        "Reva: I thought your sister's name was Esme.\r\n",
        "Arthur: Tabitha is the daughter of our \r\nbutler, Mr. Loomis, and our maid, Phoebe. You need not concern yourself with \r\nher. And neither should you. ",
        "Rupert: But father... ",
        "Arthur: You will go to your room at once. And \r\ndarest not refuse me. ",
        "Reva: Is there a reason why Rupert isn't \r\nallowed to see Tabitha? ",
        "Arthur: You will do well to keep in your \r\nplace. I know what's good for my son. ",
        "John: Beg your pardon, Sir. I didn't mean to \r\ninterrupt. ",
        "Arthur: Where is Lady Thornwood? ",
        "John: And how would I be knowing that, Sir?\r\n",
        "Arthur: My wife is faint at heart-- utterly \r\nloses her bearings at the sight of a fly. And yet, every time I take my leave, \r\nshe decides to go for a ride in the forest with Master Macgregor. ",
        "John: Perhaps M'Lord should keep his ladyship \r\nunder tighter rein? ",
        "Arthur: Perhaps Master Macgregor should keep \r\na more watchful eye on his duties? ",
        "John: Are you accusing me of being \r\nill-mannered, Sir? I have my good name to protect and I will! ",
        "Reva: Excuse me, but your wife asked Mr. \r\nMacgregor to take her for a ride in the woods and Mr. Macgregor said he had to \r\nconcentrate on his chores. Your wife, I believe, is upstairs. ",
        "Arthur: Is that true? ",
        "John: Aye. ",
        "Arthur: Aye, Sir. A word of warning, Master \r\nMacgregor. Keep to your duties and I will keep to mine. ",

        "Harley: Really, why is that? ",
        "Rick: Because this is what the Bauers do \r\nbest. I've eaten at the diner and you guys don't even do eggs well. ",

We adopted you so you can fill \r\na hole in our hearts. And you've done so much more. So much. We couldn't love \r\nyou more if you were born our own.

I have no big confession to make. But you \r\nknow, maybe our relationship would work if it was a different time in our life, \r\nbut it's not. Not anymore. So what I'm trying to say is there's Jude, there's \r\nyou, and there's this opportunity for us to make this a great family for our \r\nson, and I\u2019m so committed to that.

So when we get back into town, I'm \r\ngoing to call her up and I\u2019m going to make everything completely clear to her, \r\nbecause last time we talked, we kind of left things hanging, and that's not fair \r\nto Mel, and that's not fair to you.
