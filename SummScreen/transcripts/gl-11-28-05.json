        "Harley and Gus go to Towers early for some time before their \"big fight\". When they spot Beth, they start to argue and then after closing the door to the terrace so that Beth can't see them start making out while pretending to yell at each other. Harley leaves, pretending to be in tears and tells Gus she will meet him at Company. Beth offers Gus a deal to help him with the Harley situation after offering advice about Harley and Mallet. Mallet finds Dinah with a bottle of champagne outside of the church. She gets drunk and when Mallet says that he will take her home, she throws him over her shoulder and they exit the church. Dinah is hungry so they go to Company, where they find the restaurant closed. Dinah breaks in and when Mallet tries to climb through the window to try and shut off the alarm, he falls on top of her. Harley walks in and sees this and Mallet accuses her of being jealous. Harley says that she could care less who he sees as Gus walks in. The Reverend asks if anyone has any reason why Sandy and Tammy can not be married as Jonathan, Ava, Sandy, and Tammy think over their intertwining lives. No one says anything so the Reverend pronounces Tammy and Sandy husband and wife. As they are leaving the church a police officer stops them and says that they need to talk to Sandy. Jeffrey reads over the papers they give to him and tells the church that the wedding wasn't legal because Sandy is already married. Sandy tries to explain that he got the divorce and Ava comes forward to say that she signed the papers. Tammy can't believe that not only was Sandy married but he was married to Ava, who was helping out with the wedding and didn't say anything to her about it. Jonathan starts to go towards Tammy and Reva tells him to stay out of things. Jonathan says he wouldn't hurt Tammy and then leaves the church. Tammy angrily leaves the chapel and goes into the bride's room. Cassie, Jeffrey, and Reva come to find out if she is all right, and she storms out of the church. She sees Jonathan waiting for her outside, drinking a beer and he comes to her and sweeps her off of her feet carrying her to the getaway car. Tammy drops her bouquet out the window and they drive away."

        "Gus: We should argue more like this. Because they're not real arguments, so we can makeup because they're not real fights. I like it.",

        "Dinah: Hum? There are so many simple ways I could make my presence known here today, so many intriguing ways to get attention, but I've narrowed it down to ways-- both equally appealing. Bubbles and bubbly. You caught me, detective.",

        "Beth: Hello. Yes, Alan, I was just looking at them. Of course I remember what we agreed upon. Because I'm not ready to do that yet. Well, Alan, I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing this for Phillip's memory and for my children. Yes, yes, I will play the Mallet card if I have to, but you know what? I'm hoping I don't have to go there again. Alan, stop pushing me. Don't forget how much you need me, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: I wanted to see Tammy get married today, but I wasn't invited. So I thought maybe I could stand out here, and blow some bubbles, and wait for the happy couple to come out, then, you know, start on the champagne a little early. You want some?",
        "Mallet: Uh...",
        "Dinah: No. Come on, let's look at Tammy. She's absolutely beautiful. You should see her dress. She looks absolutely amazing. It is days like this that make you believe that anything can be possible. Come on.",

So now, the only thing left for me to do is to pronounce you husband and wife, which I do so with great honor and joy. Congratulations to you both. Sandy, you may kiss your bride.

        "Harley: You couldn't leave your frustrations at home during Tammy's wedding. No, it had to be about you.",
        "Gus: Listen to me, I couldn't keep up appearances. I was very upset. I remember our wedding when it used to be good.",
        "Harley: You mean back in the good ol' days.",
        "Gus: Back in the good ol' days. I didn't know what I was getting myself into.",
        "Harley: You wouldn't have married me? You wouldn't have married someone who was going to take on the job that you couldn't handle?",
        "Gus: You think you're so tough, huh? You think you can handle this?",
        "Harley: Say it. Say what you have to say. I can handle it.",

        "Harley: No, I mean we're so close with Beth. I love you; I want you. And if you want me, meet me at Company. Zip up. You're going to do this during Tammy and Sandy's wedding. Fine, you really are a jerk! Hi, Beth.",
        "Beth: Everything okay, Gus? I guess I didn't really have to ask that, did I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: What's the problem, you're all tuckered out?",
        "Dinah: You know what, you did it, you did it. You got me here alive. I'm here. I just would like something to eat, and then I'm going to head home, okay, so you can go.",
        "Mallet: I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but Compamy's closed. Come on, I'll drive you home.",
        "Dinah: No. N-O. I'm going to call a cab. I want to eat something, maybe some toast, some eggs -- forget it, I just need a beer. I need a beer.",
        "Mallet: I just told you, look, it is closed.",
        "Dinah: I'm going to leave the cash on the bar. It is fine. They have to keep the key somewhere around here.",
        "Mallet: Maybe on a key ring.",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs ) I told you to leave, bud.",
        "Mallet: What is going on with you right now? What is this whole thing, I didn't get invited to the wedding, and I'm mad at the world thing going on?",
        "Dinah: See if you can get this. You wouldn't understand. You know what, maybe you would, maybe you would, because you were sure that day, when Gus and Harley got married, did that feel good? Did that feel warm?",
        "Mallet: You don't really expect me to answer that, do you?",
        "Dinah: That was your answer. As much as I hate to admit, you're right. You're right. Let's go, take me home.",
        "Mallet: Good call.",

        "Sandy: It is a mistake. It's all just a mistake.",
        "Tammy: What mistake? What was on there?",
        "Cassie: Jeffrey, what does it say?",
        "Jeffrey: According to the district attorney of Shrewsbury, Sandy broke the law.",
        "Sandy: Jeffrey, Cassie, listen to me, this is just a big mistake.",
        "Tammy: Mistake, what mistake? Would somebody please tell me what is going on?",
        "Sandy: All right. It is just something I need to clear up. This guy and I are going to go outside and we need to talk. Jeff, come with me, and we'll straighten things out. I'll come back in and we'll go to the reception.",
        "Tammy: We just got married. How could he break the law?",
        "Jeffrey: Sandy broke the law because according to this, he is already married to somebody else.",

        "Coming up on \"Guiding Light\"...",
        "Gus: Mallet. What about him?",
        "Beth: We both know that A.C. Mallet figures into the equation, too.",
        "Tammy: Bigamy, this is crazy. She was your wife?",
        "Sandy: We're married. You're my wife, you're the one I love. Tammy!",

        "Mallet: I don't know why I let you talk me into coming here.",
        "Dinah: Stop it and figure out how to turn off this stupid alarm. You're not coming in here. Do it from out there.",
        "Mallet: I can't do it from out here.",
        "Dinah: I don't want you in here.",
        "Mallet: Would you step back?",
        "Dinah: I don't want you in here. Get off me!",
        "Harley: Don't move. ( Alarm sounding )",

        "Beth: Why are you and Harley the only one's at the reception.",
        "Gus: She wasn't feeling good.",
        "Beth: So you came to where the party would be? Gus.",
        "Gus: We had a fight. I thought if we came over here before all of the people got here, we could have a cooling down period. But...",
        "Beth: No go, huh?",
        "Gus: We were doing so good. We got married, we were doing fantastic, and then...",
        "Beth: Spaulding reared its ugly head.",
        "Gus: And I'm not going to let that company do it to us. I'm not going to let that company suck the life out of us.",
        "Beth: Of course you're not. You're going to get you and Harley back on track.",
        "Gus: Don't, Beth.",
        "Beth: What?",
        "Gus: Knock it off. You don't care about our marriage. All you care about is seeing her fail as a CEO, so you can become the CEO with Alan's help of course.",
        "Beth: Okay, you're right, sort of.",
        "Gus: What does that mean, sort of?",
        "Beth: It is not that I really want to see Harley fail; it is more I want Spaulding to succeed. But this isn't about me and what I want. This is about the fact that you want to rescue your marriage, and I can help you do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Bigamy? This is crazy. Sandy has never been married before. Who you are, what are you doing? This is our wedding.",
        "Jeffrey: I'll see if I can't get to the bottom of all of this. Excuse us, everybody.",
        "Reva: This has to be a mistake. It has to be. Excuse me.",
        "Tammy: Why in the world would they think you were married?",
        "Sandy: Listen, everything is fine. Jeff will get that guy to leave, and we'll have a reception.",
        "Tammy: Why don't you want to talk about it?",
        "Sandy: I don't want to talk about it here because it is nobody's business but ours.",
        "Tammy: Is it true? Sandy?",
        "Sandy: Yes and no.",
        "Tammy: What do you mean, yes and no?",
        "Sandy: I thought I was divorced.",
        "Tammy: You were married to someone else? You never said anything about this.",
        "Sandy: Because it was a long time ago, and I thought it didn't matter. I'm not a bigamist. I got divorced, and I thought it was over.",
        "Ava: He's telling you the truth, Tammy. We went to the lawyer and we signed the divorce papers together.",
        "Tammy: You? You were married to Sandy?",
        "Ava: Sorry. I wanted to tell you, but I couldn't.",

        "Tammy: What am I supposed to do?",
        "Sandy: Nothing, I will clear this up. Tammy, we're married; you're my wife. You're the one I love. Nothing's changed, has it?",
        "Josh: Tammy, why don't you and Sandy go outside and talk about this?",
        "Tammy: No. I want you to tell me how this happened. Ava has been in town for how long now? And you acted like you didn't know her. And vice versa. She was at my bachelorette party. She helped me picked out your wedding gift. But of course she did. Of course she knows what you like. She's your wife!",
        "Sandy: Tammy, please, don't say that. You're my wife.",
        "Tammy: How long ago did you marry him?",
        "Ava: Long ago.",
        "Tammy: When did you get divorced?",
        "Ava: A few weeks ago.",

        "Sandy: No, we weren't together.",
        "Ava: Xander, I'm sorry.",
        "Tammy: Xander?",
        "Ava: We hadn't seen each other for years and we lost touch.",
        "Tammy: You lost touch with your wife?",
        "Sandy: We were living apart.",
        "Tammy: You were separated, divorced, what, tell me, I've got to know.",
        "Ava: He walked out on me. He walked out on me, and I never heard from him again until I tracked him down again in Springfield.",
        "Cassie: Why don't we all just take a minute and we'll figure this out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: What do you know about this? What do you know about this situation? Was he married to her when they were back in school?",
        "Jonathan: I guess, they must have been. He didn't act like it. Maybe Sandy is not the guy she thought he was.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: You want to help me with my marriage?",
        "Beth: From what I can see, you and Harley are in big trouble.",
        "Gus: We're not a little troubled; we're a little stressed. You know, the first year is the toughest, you know what they say.",
        "Beth: I thought the first year is supposed to be the bliss.",
        "Gus: Maybe for you because your husband is in a nut house.",
        "Beth: Gus, Gus. We're talking about you.",
        "Gus: No, let's talk about you.",
        "Beth: Let's talk about you and Harley and Mallet.",
        "Gus: Mallet, what about him?",
        "Beth: The problems you have don't just have to do with Spaulding. We both know A.C. Mallet figures into the equation, too.",
        "Gus: Yeah only in Blake's over imaginative-- imagination in that so-called book of hers. No.",
        "Beth: Gus, it is admirable to be protective of your wife, but let's face it, she and Mallet have a long history together, and they spend a lot of time together in prison.",
        "Gus: Whatever, she married me.",
        "Beth: And now your relationship is under stress, and it is only natural that she would turn to somebody that she trusts, someone she cares about and knows, and obviously has the hots for.",
        "Gus: Are you trying to make me feel better? Because you know...",
        "Beth: All I'm saying is that you have a lot going on, and Alan and I could help you move some of that away.",
        "Gus: How?",
        "Beth: Say yes, and I'll tell you?",
        "Gus: Gosh, I feel like I'm making a deal with the devil here.",
        "Beth: I beg your pardon. That's Mrs. Devil. Think about it.",
        "Gus: Yeah, right, think about it, that's the last famous words, right? Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "( Alarm sounding )",
        "Harley: So let me guess, you guys broke into my dad's restaurant for, what? Some quiet time?",
        "Dinah: Speaking of quiet, turn off the alarm, Harley, please! ( Alarm stops ) thank you.",
        "Mallet: I think she was desperate for a beer after she finished the champagne. I found her suffering outside the church with some kind of wedding-induced anxiety. Not the normal hysteria that usually effects the rest of the population.",
        "Harley: Abnormal hysteria.",
        "Dinah: Ha-ha.",
        "Mallet: Right. But anyway, I was going to take her home, but she insisted on coming here and the next thing I know, she is breaking in and she's stealing beer.",
        "Dinah: Excuse me. You pushed yourself through the window, and you almost broke one of my ribs, in a misguided attempt to rescue three dollars of beer, which I was going to pay for anyway.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, and you'll live. You'll have to drive her home because I've had enough for the night.",
        "Harley: Okay, okay, okay. Why don't you eat something? Can I talk to you for a second. Why don't you give Dinah a break?",
        "Mallet: Why?",
        "Harley: Because she has been through a lot. And yeah, okay, she has managed to cause most of that. But, you know, for some people, weddings bring up not always pleasant feelings. I should know, I was one of those people before I met Gus. And she has a history with Cassie. Although, she's past that. You are past that history.",
        "Dinah: Extremely past that.",
        "Harley: She's past the history. But she is still allowed to have feelings.",
        "Dinah: Mm-hm. Bless you. God bless you.",
        "Harley: And you of all people should know what it is like to be outside looking in, you know.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I know. Yeah. I stood right there during your wedding and I watched. It was a great day for you, and not so great for me.",
