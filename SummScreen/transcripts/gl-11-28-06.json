        "Lizzie: They're coming faster. This is it, Jonathan. The baby is coming now. I can feel it.",
        "Tammy: What if the ambulance doesn't make it?",
        "Jonathan: Then we do it ourselves. We'll have the baby right here.",
        "Tammy: We will?",
        "Jonathan: Yes. It's my daughter, and I'm not going to abandon her. And you're going to help me, okay?",
        "Lizzie: What are you talking about? You've never delivered a baby before.",
        "Jonathan: What, are you doubting me, woman?",
        "Lizzie: Yes.",
        "Jonathan: People deliver babies every day all over the world. Cab drivers can do it. Plus, Remy is going to be over here as soon as he's done with that other driver.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And cops are trained to deliver babies.",
        "Jonathan: And Tammy took C.P.R., and they taught you first aid, right?",
        "Tammy: Yeah.",
        "Jonathan: You see, there's really nothing to worry about. Everything's going to be fine.",
        "Lizzie: What if it isn't? What if something goes wrong?",
        "Jonathan: Nothing is going to go wrong. I won't let it, okay? I told you, I'm going to take care of you and the kid. You've got to trust me.",
        "Lizzie: I do trust you.",
        "Jonathan: Okay, and Tammy, too. Okay? We're going to be a team, just like we were before, right? Team?",
        "Lizzie: Team.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, team.",
        "Tammy: Absolutely.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "( Knock at door )",
        "Frank: Hey, man.",
        "Jeffrey: Hey, Frank. Come on in. Shouldn't you be with your family or something?",
        "Frank: Yeah, I was. I just had some work to do. I heard a rumor about you.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, you heard that Doris fired me, right?",
        "Frank: Is it true?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, it would be true, if I didn't quit first. Got to devote all my time to being mayor now, Frank.",
        "Frank: Well, until Blake recovers, right, Jeffrey?",
        "Jeffrey: Right. Well, you're assuming that Blake doesn't go to jail once she recovers, and that the voters still want her.",
        "Frank: Look, we all have our skeletons, right?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. The difference is, I've come clean about mine. You're right. I think the voters do like to forgive politicians. It makes them feel superior.",
        "Doris: There's only one thing the voters like more than forgiveness: That's justice.",
        "Jeffrey: Get out, Doris.",
        "Doris: Tough guy.",
        "Jeffrey: You know what? I don't have to be nice to you. You work for me now.",
        "Doris: Not anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Burned turkey. Deserted by my daughter and my brother, and Reva never even showed up! So much for me even thinking that I could somehow bring this family together at Thanksgiving. It's a good thing you weren't there to witness this, daddy. You would have really loved it, I'm sure. ( Laughs ) H.B., you devil.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: So, let's see, sausage for you, pepperoni for Josh. What else? Anchovies?",
        "R.J.: Hey, Mom, that's gross. Hey, Mom, is Thanksgiving always going to be like this? I mean, everyone leaving, and us just ordering pizza?",
        "Josh: Put down the phone. Grab your coat and your boots, gloves, the whole thing. We're going out.",
        "Cassie: Where?",
        "Josh: Well, my old man, he has a weird way of telling me things.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Homeless guy: Haven't seen one all day, lady.",
        "Reva: Great.",
        "Homeless guy: Can't blame them, I guess. The roads are bad. There's lots of accidents.",
        "Reva: Yeah, I know. It's just that my son and his wife are out there someplace, and... here. You take care of yourself, okay? Happy Thanksgiving.",
        "Homeless guy: Same.",
        "Reva: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: How's that?",
        "Lizzie: I don't care. I just want the baby to be okay.",
        "Jonathan: She will be. She's going to be fine.",
        "Tammy: I found this stuff in the cop car. Remy will be here as soon as he can. He's just having trouble getting that guy out of the other car.",
        "Jonathan: Is the other guy okay?",
        "Tammy: I don't know. But the ambulance will be here any minute.",
        "Lizzie: That's what you said ten minutes ago. Where is that stupid ambulance?",
        "Jonathan: They'll be here. They'll be here.",
        "Lizzie: ( Screams )",
        "Tammy: Lizzie, wait. You feel it, huh?",
        "Lizzie: Like my insides are being ripped out.",
        "Jonathan: All right, Lizzie, breathe. Breathe like you did before. Good girl. The short breaths.",
        "Tammy: Okay, I'll do it with you, okay? On the next contraction. Ready?",
        "Lizzie: Okay.",
        "Jonathan: Good. Okay, okay. We can do this. I told you, we can do it, okay? ( Breathing heavily )",

        "Ava: I'm going to get you.",
        "Coop: What you got? You can't catch me.",
        "Ava: I'm an athlete.",
        "Coop: You didn't get... that's not fair. That's not... that's not fair.",
        "Ava: It's strip football. It's not supposed to be fair. You should let me do the touchdown. I was going to do a victory dance.",
        "Coop: Victory dance, really? I guess that would probably be worth at least six million points.",
        "Ava: Oh, you should see me go for that extra point. It would have been good.",
        "Coop: I bet it would have been good. This is quickly becoming my favorite new holiday tradition. I've got to tell you.",
        "Ava: Really?",
        "Coop: Yes.",
        "Ava: Even more than Buzz' feast?",
        "Coop: It's a pretty good feast, I'll tell you that. Buzz, his cooking is perfect with the holidays. The turkey, it's just...",
        "Ava: Even the little cardboard turkey?",
        "Coop: The little thing? Yeah, well, I do have a soft spot for construction paper.",
        "Ava: Of course. And the classic Cooper football game?",
        "Coop: Clearly.",
        "Ava: Really?",
        "Coop: Yeah. Well, as long as you're on my team this time.",
        "Ava: I don't know if I want to be on your team. Your dad is a much better captain.",
        "Coop: Yes, my dad is a very good captain. But if my dad had his way, I'm sure Olivia would be the captain of the other team. Speaking of which, I wonder if he's proposed to her.",
        "Ava: Sh, sh, sh, sh.",
        "Coop: I'm just... can I talk? Can I finish? Thank you. I'm just saying that if Olivia says yes, then my dad is going to be your dad. That's disgusting. Stepdad.",
        "Ava: That's gross.",
        "Coop: Okay, your stepdad. Well, look, it could be worse, okay? I mean, your dad could be Jeffrey O'Neill. I'm sorry. That just kind of slipped out. I shouldn't have said that.",
        "Ava: No, it's cool.",
        "Coop: I apologize.",
        "Ava: It's cool, it's cool. You want to see me score a touchdown?",
        "Coop: Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.",
        "Ava: Ready?",
        "Coop: Right now.",
        "Ava: Okay.",
        "Coop: Bring it. What do you got?",
        "Coop: That's illegal.",
        "Ava: You loved it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: You know, maybe you need to brush up on your civics lessons, Doris, but Mayor trumps D.A. every time.",
        "Doris: Governor trumps Mayor. Hey, you know, without the beard, you are the spitting image of Richard Winslow.",
        "Jeffrey: You know, Doris, you're an ugly drunk.",
        "Doris: And you know what? The governor has rescinded your appointment as acting Mayor. Looks like your 15 minutes of fame are over.",
        "Jeffrey: What are you talking about?",
        "Doris: Oh, you're going to get a call first thing in the morning.",
        "Jeffrey: Let me check up on that.",
        "Doris: Turns out that press conference you gave where you thought you put out the fires really only fanned the flames. Our governor owes his reelection to the women voters of this state. And you know what? They've been calling me all morning. They don't like what they're hearing, Jeffrey-- something about you and an underage girl. They don't trust you, Jeffrey. And to think you were flying so high above the rest of us, so superior. How's the view now?",
        "Frank: You know, Doris, that's enough.",
        "Doris: You know what, Frank? Let's celebrate, Chief. Hm? Come downstairs. You know what, because the party is still going strong. No? Well, I'd be careful. I don't think it would be in your best interest to be seen with a guy like him.",
        "Frank: I'll take my chances.",
        "Doris: Suit yourself.",
        "Jeffrey: What did they say?",
        "Frank: You're out, Jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: Thanks. Doris is right. You know, you probably... you probably should go. Losing can be contagious, and right now I have lost just about everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doris: Done.",
        "Olivia: How did he look when you told him?",
        "Doris: Like his career was over, which it is. You know, when you told me what he had done to you, all it took was a couple of phone calls to the right women's groups. That creep is going to be paying for his sins. Happy Thanksgiving.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: So, Mom, what time do you have to be back at the hospital?",
        "Lillian: I have to get back soon, honey. I'm so glad we get to spend a few minutes together, though. How do you think Alan's doing?",
        "Beth: I think he'll survive. You know something? It was really good to spend a little time at the clinic.",
        "Lillian: I am so proud of you, I really am. So selfless of you. Hey, Mel. You're going in, too?",
        "Mel: Hey. Yeah, I'm actually... I just got called in. What about you?",
        "Lillian: I've been in. I'm going back. How was your Thanksgiving?",
        "Mel: It was all right.",
        "Lillian: Was Rick with you?",
        "Mel: No. He had to work at the clinic.",
        "Lillian: Oh, the clinic, yeah. It's very selfless, I think, to spend time at the clinic, don't you, honey?",
        "Mel: Oh. It's the E.R. It's probably a car accident. I'm afraid there's going to be a lot of them today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Okay, so here's the thing now. Come here, R. J. See, when I was growing up, my dad, he had this tradition where, right after Thanksgiving dinner, we would all go out into the woods near Cross Creek and cut down our own Christmas tree. So I figured that we're going to do that right here and now and sort of start our own tradition. What do you think?",
        "R.J.: In the dark?",
        "Josh: What are you talking about? It's not dark. Look, look, look-- full moon. Okay, so pick out a tree, any one you want, as long as it fits in the living room. Okay?",
        "R.J.: Cool.",
        "Cassie: This is a great idea, Josh.",
        "Josh: Yeah. Well, I just figured, you know, Thanksgiving was pretty much a bust. But we'll make up for it by having a month-long Christmas celebration.",
        "Cassie: Sounds good to me.",
        "R.J.: Guys, over here. Look, it's perfect.",
        "Josh: Okay, okay. Yeah, I think you're right, I think you're right. Here, you hold that. Okay, now, I'm going to make a couple of smaller cuts, okay, to get it started, and then, once I get it going, you can help me out and we'll cut it down together. All right? Hang on, here we go, here we go. All right. Ow!",
        "Cassie: What happened? Josh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Thanks.",
        "Alan: Why are you trying to get a cab when I have a car and driver...",
        "Reva: You were so busy trying to commandeer a helicopter. If you're offering me a ride, I'll take it. Are you?",
        "Alan: Well, maybe I won't if you're going to be so unpleasant.",
        "Lillian: Hail, hail, the gang's all here.",
        "Reva: Hi.",
        "Lillian: Reva, Happy Thanksgiving.",
        "Reva: Happy Thanksgiving.",
        "Lillian: What are you two doing wandering around?",
        "Alan: Did you get my message, Beth?",
        "Beth: What message?",
        "Alan: Elizabeth came to the house when you left, and she went into labor.",
        "Reva: Her water broke.",
        "Beth: It's early!",
        "Alan: Jonathan insisted on bringing her to the hospital, and they may have been in an accident.",
        "Beth: Oh, my gosh.",
        "Reva: It's okay, it's okay. It's under control. The ambulance is on its way.",
        "Lillian: Well, was anybody hurt?",
        "Reva: We don't know.",
        "Beth: But she's in labor!",
        "Alan: And that's why we are trying to get to her.",
        "Mel: Well, that's silly if the E.M.T.'s are already on its way. Why don't you guys come to the E.R. and stay with us and wait for them there?",
        "Reva: That's a good idea. Come on, let's go.",
        "Beth: How could you let this happen?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: That's it, Lizzie, you're doing great. You're doing great.",
        "Lizzie: It wasn't supposed to be like this. ( Screams ) I was supposed to be at the hospital with doctors and nurses and... ( screams )",
        "Tammy: Exhale, Lizzie. Pant, okay? Pant.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, pant, pant. Pant like Roxy does when she wants a treat-- biscuits, bones.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, my God, if I wasn't in so much pain, I would punch you in the face.",
        "Jonathan: All right, punch me in the face if it will make you feel better.",
        "Tammy: Can I punch you too?",
        "Jonathan: Later.",
        "Lizzie: I have to push. I have to push.",
        "Jonathan: No pushing until the ambulance gets here.",
        "Lizzie: She's coming right now. I have to push, for real.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, come here. Okay, we're here for you. You do what you've got to do, okay?",
        "Lizzie: I'm really scared. I'm really scared.",
        "Jonathan: I know, I know, I know, I know, I know. Okay, on the count of three, you're going to push with all your strength, okay?",
        "Tammy: Breathe in deep, remember?",
        "Jonathan: Deep breath, ready? Deep breath, all the way in. One, two, three.",
        "Tammy: Go, go, go, go, go. ( Grunting )",
        "Jonathan: Nothing. There's nothing yet. She's not here, okay? Lizzie, you've got to push again, okay? Deep breath. Yes, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: No, it hurts!",
        "Jonathan: You're tough. I know you, okay? You can do this. You have to, okay? Now, deep breath. Come on, baby.",
        "Tammy: Deep breath, and then with all your strength...",
        "Lizzie: Okay.",
        "Jonathan: Ready? One, two, three. Push! Push! I can see her, I can see her, I can see her! Okay, just keep pushing! Keep pushing! Come on, let's go! Go, go! One more push! ( Screaming )",
        "Lizzie: Is she here?",
        "Jonathan: She's here. She's here. She's beautiful. You did it. She's here. Oh, my God. She's beautiful. Hey. Hey. You're beautiful.",
        "Jonathan: She's so little. I can't... I can't believe it.",
        "Tammy: She's beautiful.",
        "Lizzie: Is my baby okay?",
        "Jonathan: Your baby... yeah, your baby's perfect. I know, little sweetie. She's got ten fingers and ten toes and...",
        "Lizzie: Thank God.",
        "Jonathan: Does her breathing seem okay to you?",
        "Lizzie: Her breathing? What's wrong with it?",
        "Jonathan: Nothing, nothing. Sh. Hey, what are you doing? Tammy, is that normal for her to pass out like that?",
        "Tammy: I don't know. Oh, my God. Look at all that blood. Is that normal?",
        "Jonathan: I don't know. I don't know anything. Where's that freaking ambulance?",
        "Tammy: Lizzie?",
        "Jonathan: Sh. Come here. Come take the baby, okay, so I can get Lizzie? Okay, okay. Yeah, come here sweetie. ( Baby crying ) Oh, you're okay, you're okay. Okay, okay.",
        "Tammy: Hello, baby. You're all right. I've got you. I've got you.",
        "Jonathan: Over here. Over here. There we go. My wife and my baby both need help.",
        "E.M.T.: Okay.",
        "Jonathan: Come on, honey. Okay. Okay.",
        "Remy: Whoa.",
        "Tammy: She might have a problem, and Lizzie is passed out and bleeding.",
        "Remy: Hey, take everyone to Cedars, okay? I'll give you an escort.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: I wish we could just stay here and pretend there were nothing else out there.",
        "Coop: Well, what if I just don't say Olivia or Jeffrey's name until, I don't know, next year? How about that? What if I don't bring it up?",
        "Ava: How about forever? ( Knock at door )",
        "Coop: Oh. You know what that means?",
        "Ava: What?",
        "Coop: Hot chocolate.",
        "Ava: Oh, hot chocolate.",
        "Coop: I'll be right back. All right. Coming, coming, coming. Frank? What...",
        "Frank: I'm trying to figure a way out of here so I don't run into Doris Wolfe. I've had enough of her for one night.",
        "Coop: What did she do to you?",
        "Frank: Not me-- Jeffrey O'Neill.",
        "Ava: What about Jeffrey?",
        "Frank: She gave him the boot. He's not mayor any longer. Anyway, it's a long story, you know, with all that negative publicity and all.",
        "Ava: How is he doing?",
        "Frank: How do you think?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: I wouldn't do that if I were you. See, it costs money, and I hear you're going to have a tough time finding another job.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mel: Did the ambulance get here yet?",
        "Nurse: They're on their way.",
        "Mel: Okay. So the ambulance got to Lizzie and Jonathan. It's on its way back.",
        "Lillian: How is Lizzie? How far apart are her contractions?",
        "Mel: I don't know. Lillian?",
        "Lillian: I'll be right back.",
        "Rick: Hey.",
        "Mel: Rick. What are you doing here? I thought you were at the clinic.",
        "Rick: Well, actually, I have been here. Did you hear they're bringing Lizzie Spaulding in? She's in labor.",
        "Mel: Yes, I know. Beth's here. She's a mess.",
        "Rick: Well, it's good that her husband's here for her then. How was dinner with your folks, for Thanksgiving?",
        "Mel: Leah didn't say two words the whole time.",
        "Rick: I'm sorry to hear that. Well, obviously I'm glad you're here for Lizzie and her baby, and that's the good news.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: What is taking that ambulance so long?",
        "Alan: You know, maybe you should go join Rick. Looks like you need a shoulder to lean on.",
        "Billy: Hey, Rick?",
        "Rick: Yeah?",
        "Billy: Yeah, I've got a little casualty here from Outskirts. This fellow decided to make wild turkey this Thanksgiving meal, and he did a little header on the bar. Do you think you can handle it?",
        "Rick: Yeah, you got a nasty cut. Let's go take a look at it. This way.",
        "Billy: Hey, what are you doing... Lizzie?",
        "Reva: Yeah. She went into labor, but then they were on the way to the hospital, and they had an accident.",
        "Billy: Oh, no.",
        "Reva: No, it's okay. The ambulance found them, and it's... they're bringing them here. That's why we're here waiting.",
        "Billy: How do you feel?",
        "Reva: I just want to see them.",
        "Billy: Why don't I prop you up, okay?",
        "Josh: I'm telling you, this is unnecessary. The bleeding has almost stopped. I mean, there's no reason for...",
        "Cassie: I still want you to have a doctor take a look at it.",
        "Josh: What are you doing here?",
        "Beth: Lizzie? Oh, my God!",
        "Alan: Elizabeth?",
        "Jonathan: Somebody help my wife and kid!",

        "E.M.T.: Yeah, she's having some bleeding.",

I mean, it's still Thanksgiving, and we haven't eaten yet, so... this is from Robert Louis Stevenson, called \"Thanksgiving Grace.\" \"Behold our family here assembled. We thank thee for this place in which we dwell, for the love that unites us, for the peace accorded us this day, for the hope with which we expect the morrow, for the health, the work, the food, and the bright skies that make our lives delightful. And for our friends on all parts of the earth. Let peace abound in our small company.\"",
