        "Marah: Doorbell. ",
        "Sam: I need to talk to you. ",
        "Marah: I'm sorry, but I've reached my apology \r\nquota. But you know what? Try making it in the next millennium. ",
        "Sam: I meant everyone of them, you know?\r\n",
        "Marah: I know. ",
        "Sam: Look, I'm not here to try and get \r\nanother chance, okay? Can I come in? Okay. Marah, look, I know things have been \r\nreally tough for you lately. ",
        "Marah: What do you mean? ",
        "Sam: I read your essay. ",
        "Marah: You too? ",
        "Sam: Yeah, I guess it was sort of scattered \r\nall over town. And I was a little bit worried about you. And keeping a low \r\nprofile, huh? ",
        "Marah: Yeah, well... ",
        "Sam: I just wanted you to know that the \r\nreferences to me, I'm okay with that-- I understand. ",
        "Marah: And the ones about Tony? ",
        "Sam: You were just being honest, right?\r\n",
        "Marah: Thank you for your support, but you \r\nknow what? I'm more than a little talked out on the subject, so... ",
        "Sam: Actually, that's good because it's not \r\nreally the subject I'd like to focus on. I need your help. ",
        "",
        "\r\nBen: \"Yeah, I'm a virgin. You want to make something of it?\" (Laughs) You bet \r\nI do. I'm going to win this bet, Marky boy. Trust me. Those other guys aren't \r\neven going to get a turn at bat. Marah's as good as mine. ",
        "Mark: A lot of confidence, Reade. ",
        "Ben: That's right, I do. But this one is a \r\npiece of cake. I can't? I reintroduced myself to her, made some small talk about \r\nour past history, got myself back on her radar. Now I can move on to step two. \r\nDid you get what I asked for? ",
        "Mark: Oh, yeah. Right here. ",
        "Ben: Knew that little nerd in English Lit \r\nwould come through. Very nice. Yep. This is going to get me one step closer to \r\nlittle Miss Marah. ",

        "\r\nGus: Hey, lady, you know there is a speed limit in this town. You should slow \r\ndown. ",
        "Harley: I was going to call you. ",
        "Gus: Really? ",
        "Harley: Yeah. ",
        "Gus: I was going to call you. Well, I...\r\n",
        "Harley: Oh, okay. Well, it's about that \r\nperpetrator. Remember the perpetrator who duct taped our hands, tied us in the \r\nwarehouse, that whole little incident? Know anything about that guy? ",
        "Gus: Cupid, you mean. I call him cupid. No, I \r\ndidn't find anything. But if I did find him, I might send him a thank you card. \r\nBecause you know, well, being tied up with you all night long, cheek to cheek, \r\nthat's my idea of a good evening. ",
        "Harley: Are you done yet? ",
        "Gus: Just let me ask you something: Can you \r\nhonestly tell me in your heart that you didn't feel anything? ",
        "Harley: I filed a report about the incident \r\nand I\u2019m staying on this, Aitoro, okay? ",
        "Gus: Good. Good. I wouldn't do anything \r\ndifferently. How's my godson? ",
        "Harley: (Laughs) He's not your godson.\r\n",
        "Gus: Oh, yeah, he's my godson. I delivered \r\nhim, that's my godson. Hasn't he told you? Oh, he hasn't told you yet. He will. \r\nWe have a special bond. Where is he? You've been hiding him. I don't get to see \r\nhim. ",
        "Harley: Well, we weren't here. We went and \r\ntook a break ",
        "Gus: Oh, that's nice, you and Jude. \r\n",
        "Harley: And Zach. And... and Rick. \r\n",
        "Gus: That's romantic. ",
        "Harley: It wasn't. It wasn't at all, \r\nactually, not at all, because all these people ended up showing up-- my father \r\nand my brother and Holly and all those people. ",
        "Gus: Yeah, that's Springfield for you. \r\nTogether they can have a single thought. You know, because if it had been me, I \r\nwould have taken you someplace really romantic, you know. Well. Just... Can you \r\nhonestly say that you didn't feel anything at all? Anything? ",
        "Harley: Look, I gotta tell you something. \r\nRick's moved in with me already, for good. ",
        "Gus: Well, congratulations. Congratulations. \r\nI'm really happy for you. ",
        "Harley: Yeah. Me too. ",

        "\r\nRick: Can I have this? ",
        "Michelle: No. ",
        "Rick: What? ",
        "Michelle: It's a fondue pot and it was a \r\nwedding present. ",
        "Danny: Take it. ",
        "Michelle: Danny. ",
        "Danny: Honey, whoever gave that to us \r\nobviously doesn't know us. When's the last time we had fondue? ",
        "Rick: There you go. ",
        "Michelle: Rick, it's not like Harley doesn't \r\nhave a kitchen. ",
        "Rick: Have you tasted her cooking? Have you?\r\n",
        "Michelle: Take it. ",
        "Rick: Thank you. ",
        "Michelle: I'll give you some cookbooks.\r\n",
        "Rick: Great, thanks. ",
        "Danny: So how's it going with Harley? You \r\nguys seemed to be pretty comfy at the cabin the other day. ",
        "Rick: Oh, yeah. We've always been comfortable \r\nwith each other, which makes the adjusting part a lot easier. And I get to see \r\nmy kid whenever I want. You know, take him for walks with that... That baby \r\ncarrier, you know, the one you strap on your chest. ",
        "Danny: Love that thing. ",
        "Rick: Yeah. I'm finally a dad, you know. \r\nWouldn't trade it for anything in the world. It's great. ",
        "Michelle: You're going to be the best dad in \r\nthe whole world-- well, next to Danny. (Knock on door) That's probably Harley \r\nnow. ",
        "Rick: Oh, finally, some help. ",
        "Michelle: Yes. ",
        "Carmen: Well, I hope so. ",
        "Rick: Nobody's home. ",
        "Danny: It's okay, Rick. It's okay. Actually, \r\nI invited her over. ",
        "Rick: This is a joke, right? ",
        "Danny: Come on in. ",
        "Rick: I'm sorry. I must be missing something. \r\nLast time I heard Carmen was the women who kidnapped Michelle and tried to kill \r\nher-- not once but twice-- and you've invited her over for lunch. ",
        "Carmen: I have apologized to Danny and \r\nMichelle, and they have found it in their hearts to forgive me. ",
        "Rick: Michelle. ",
        "Michelle: It's true. ",
        "Rick: Oh, come on. You're insane. You're both \r\ninsane. ",
        "Michelle: Rick, Carmen is family and she's \r\nmade it very clear to us that she's not going anywhere. And we thought it would \r\nbe best for us and for Robbie. ",
        "Rick: How could you possibly think this is a \r\ngood, you think this is a good thing for Robbie? ",
        "Danny: Rick... ",
        "Rick: And you're okay with this, right?\r\n",
        "Danny: My mother has... She's very sorry for \r\neverything that happened. She's made amends. ",
        "Rick: I just hope... I just hope you both \r\nknow what you're doing, that's all. See you later, okay? ",

        "\r\nMarah: You want my help? What's wrong with this picture? ",
        "Sam: It's work related, Marah. I think I told \r\nyou, I'm working with Holly now at the \"journal.\" ",
        "Marah: I thought you were supposed to go to \r\nHarvard. ",
        "Sam: I was going to go to Harvard, but I \r\ncouldn't let certain people have the satisfaction of running me out of this \r\ntown. ",
        "Marah: By certain people you mean Tony, \r\nright? ",
        "Sam: No. Not just Tony. Look, Marah, I don't \r\nhave a problem with this cheap, twisted, little love triangle thing between you, \r\nme and Tony, that's not it. I've dealt with us, okay? But there are some things \r\nthat are left unfinished between Tony and I. Some things I still have to deal \r\nwith, like his illegal business here in Springfield. Come on, Marah, you know \r\nthe deal, and that guy's up to his neck now in his family business. ",
        "Marah: So what? ",
        "Sam: So that's the kind of business that \r\nneeds to be run out of this town. And I happen to be in a particular position to \r\ndo that now. ",
        "Marah: So you think you just can come in here \r\nand pump some information out of me, and then what? Write some stupid article \r\nand then win some stupid journalism award or something? Get out. ",
        "Sam: What the hell are you talking about? It \r\nhas nothing to do with that and you know it. Look, Marah, if it's definitely \r\nover between you and Tony, then name one good reason why you shouldn't help me.\r\n",

        "Mel: Yeah. ",
        "Gus: Could use a break. ",
        "Mel: Yeah, I can. I've been up all night with \r\nthis baby who needed a liver transplant. But he's going to be okay, so I am \r\nrelieved and happy but exhausted. ",
        "Gus: I bet. I'm one of the few that like \r\nliver. I'm joking; I'm kidding. Actually, you know, I can relate a little bit-- \r\nnot quite on your level-- but I... I helped deliver a baby a few months ago and \r\nit changed my life, you could say. ",

        "Mel: Yeah. ",
        "Gus: Well, she has decided to try to move \r\nforward with this guy because she thinks it's the right thing to do. It's not \r\neven feeling, it's just she thinks it's the right thing to do. ",
