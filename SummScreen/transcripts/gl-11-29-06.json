        "Olivia: Come on, come on! Buzz, it's me. Listen, I'm leaving you a message. It's very much like the other three I left you. Call me, please. I really need to see you. You were going to proposed to me. Why didn't you? Hey, I need to see Buzz. It's urgent.",
        "Lynn: Sorry, Olivia, I haven't seen Buzz here all day. Hey, but if you want to leave a message...",
        "Olivia: I left ten messages. Sorry. Thank you. Hey! There you are. No wonder you haven't returned my calls. You've been at the movies. Hi. So how was it, good as ever?",
        "Buzz: Well, somehow it didn't do it for me this time. For the record, I had the cell phone turned off.",
        "Olivia: So you haven't spoken to me or to Coop today.",
        "Buzz: No, what's going on with Coop?",
        "Olivia: He told me about the ring and the proposal, and",
        "Buzz: He told you about the--",
        "Olivia: He thought you would pop the question, but you didn't.",
        "Buzz: No.",
        "Olivia: Well that's why you brought me here the other night, right?",
        "Buzz: That was the plan, yes.",
        "Olivia: Well you didn't say anything.",
        "Buzz: I... you...",
        "Olivia: What?",
        "Buzz: I love you. I'm crazy about you. I'm crazy about your beauty, your intelligence, your weaknesses, your strengths. You know... they're just so incredibly vibrant. And how could I not love you? Somehow-- oddly enough we seem to fit together.",
        "Olivia: Okay. Shouldn't you be on your knee for this speech?",
        "Buzz: No.",
        "Olivia: Everything you said is good. We do fit.",
        "Buzz: Not when it counts. I mean was there with the ring in my hand and I was getting ready to kneel on one of my arthritic knees, but then you launch into some stupid tirade about Jeffrey O'Neill and it's just you know...",
        "Olivia: What a sec-- no! Come on. Ava got me stirred up. I was angry.",
        "Buzz: You were angry? You are anger. Come on. I had an epiphany. I realized that you hate him more than you could ever love me.",
        "Olivia: Buzz...",
        "Buzz: Oh, come on, how can I ask you to marry me when there is this huge, black hole of rage that is part of you all of the time?",
        "Olivia: I can change. I can let it go. I can learn to let it go.",
        "Buzz: Can you? Because every single day since this started, the anger has been building. It hasn't been abating. It's like an acid, and it just destroys everything it touches. I mean, no matter how much love there is, how can we have a marriage with that in the mix?",
        "Olivia: I wish I could say you were wrong.",
        "Buzz: I don't want it this way.",
        "Olivia: Would you do me a favor? Don't get rid of the ring just yet, okay?",
        "Buzz: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Hey. Come here. You know what, since you can't sleep, I'm going to say good-bye to you in person, okay? Because I have to go on a little trip. I'm going to get up on a plane and go to someplace, but I'm not going to be gone long, okay, so you need to be good for Jane. I want to be good, too, Em. And that's why I'm getting on a plane and going to... ( laughing ) There you go. Stay there. Okay, baby. I love you, you know that? And I love Buzz, and I'm not going to let anything keep me from loving you even more. You got it? High five. All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Realtor: No, it's all right. Come in.",
        "Olivia: So how long has the house been on the market?",
        "Realtor: It seems like forever. No one's interested in the place. The last renters moved out in 2000. How many years ago did you say you lived here?",
        "Olivia: Oh, that seems like forever, too.",
        "Realtor: Well, feel free to stay as long as you like. You put boom-boom into my heart you send my soul sky-high when your lovin' starts jitterbug into my brain yeah, yeah goes a bang, bang, till my feet do the same but something's bugging you something ain't right my best friend told me what you did last night left me sleepin' in my bed I was dreamin', but I should have been with you instead... ( knocking on the door ) don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo ( knocking at the door ) wake me up before you go-go...",
        "Olivia's mother: Olivia, open this door right now! ( Knocking at the door )",
        "Young Olivia: Yes, mother?",
        "Olivia's mother: Why was the door locked?",
        "Young Olivia: It's called privacy, something you want when you want to be alone. P-r-i--",
        "Olivia's mother: You're wearing makeup, why?",
        "Young Olivia: It's hardly any.",
        "Olivia's mother: If you're still thinking of trying to get into that party at the Embassy, put it out of your head.",
        "Young Olivia: I have a friend that can get me in.",
        "Olivia's mother: You're not leaving this house.",
        "Young Olivia: It bothers you so much that I might have one fun night.",
        "Olivia: Don't go.",
        "Olivia's mother: Olivia, when are you going to listen to me. I told you over and over again, there are two kinds of people--",
        "Young Olivia: \"In this world.\"",
        "Olivia's mother: That's right. Those who have and those who don't. We don't.",
        "Young Olivia: Yeah, and who's fault is that?",
        "Olivia's mother: Don't you talk to me like that.",
        "Young Olivia: Well, you never let me.",
        "Olivia's mother: What, get yourself in trouble?",
        "Olivia: Listen to her, she knows what you're talking about.",
        "Young Olivia: You don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Olivia's mother: There'll be men there, drinking, who'd love to get their hands on a pretty young thing like you.",
        "Young Olivia: Here we go again: Mom's standard warning.",
        "Olivia: They'll do more than just try to put their hands on her. Talk to her. Please, Mom, make her understand.",
        "Olivia's mother: I can not fight with you anymore over this. You are not leaving this house tonight, and that is that.",
        "Olivia: Don't go. She's right about everything. Please, stay here. If you go to that party, something terrible is going to happen to you, please don't go.",
        "Young Olivia: I'm not a kid anymore. ( Duran Duran \"Rio\" playing )",
        "Party host: Evening. Name, please?",
        "Young Olivia: I'm not on the list. I was supposed to come with a friend, and she got sick, I think. I should go, I'm sorry.",
        "Party host: Wait. This is a party. There's always room for a beautiful woman, friend or no friend.",
        "Young Olivia: I don't know, I don't even have I.D.",
        "Party host: I won't tell if you don't. Go on in. Have some fun. There are plenty of guys who would like to get out on the dance floor with you. You know you're something special and you like you're the best her name is Rio and she dances on the sand just like that river twisting through a dusty land and when she shines...",
        "Olivia: You idiot! \"I have to go to this party, I don't care what mom says. There are going to be a million guys there. Maybe one will fall in love with me and get me out of this crummy life.\" Geesh, what who did I think I was , Cinderella? \"I don't have enough money to buy a dress, but maybe I can cut the sleeves off the green one and punk up my hair so that I look okay. I hear there's major dancing at the Embassy parties.\" ( Rock music playing ) ( Duran Duran's \"Rio\" playing ) Moving on the floor now babe you're a bird of paradise cherry ice cream smile I suppose it's very nice with a step to your left and a flick to the right you catch the mirror way out west... ( distant laughter )",
        "Olivia: \"It won't be easy getting into the party. I'm not invited, and I don't even have a fake I.D., So...\"",
        "Young Olivia: I'll have to do what they do in the movies: Act older and talk my way in. Oh Rio Rio dancer across the Rio Grande...",
        "Olivia: Oh, lord, I remember this now. I kept thinking: \"Skin, you have to show a little skin.\" It doesn't make you look sexy, it makes you look cheap.",
        "Young Olivia: Excellent.",
        "Olivia: Please don't do this just go home. Go home.",
        "Party host: Evening. Name, please?",
        "Young Olivia: I'm not on the list. I was supposed to be with a friend, but she got sick. You're not going to make me leave, are you?",
        "Party host: Do you have I.D.?",
        "Young Olivia: Sure. Oh, no. I must have forgot it at home.",
        "Party host: How old are you?",
        "Olivia: Too young.",
        "Young Olivia: I'm not a child, if that's what you're asking.",
        "Olivia: The hell you're not.",
        "Young Olivia: Listen, I've been waiting for this party for months. You're not going to make me leave? Please?",
        "Party host: I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do... unless someone inside can vouch for you. I tell you something I now what you're thinking I tell you something I now what you're thinking her name is Rio and....",
        "Olivia: Oh, my God.",
        "Young Olivia: Oh, my God. One of my favorite guy's from my neighborhood's here. He'll tell you I'm cool.",
        "Olivia: Turn around, and walk out the door. Now! I understand why you're doing this. Please leave. This is not a nice guy. He's not going to fall in love with you, and make your life a fairytale. It's the opposite. He's going to make you wish you were dead.",
        "Young Olivia: What did you do, mom, rent a space in my brain or something? You got to catch up?",
        "Young Jeffrey: I'm okay. ( Laughter )",
        "Young Olivia: Uh-oh, you've already started drinking without me? You see that guy over there?",
        "Young Jeffrey: Uh... yeah.",
        "Young Olivia: He doesn't like me.",
        "Young Jeffrey: I bet he's nuts.",
        "Young Olivia: Right? He said that somebody has to vouch for me if I want to stay at this party, which I do. And I know you don't want me to leave. So, will you? Want to help me?",
        "Young Jeffrey: Be your date tonight?",
        "Young Olivia: Be my date.",
        "Olivia: No.",
        "Young Jeffrey: I think I can handle that.",
        "Young Olivia: We'll see about that. Come on, you have to dance with me.",
        "Young Jeffrey: I'm a lousy dancer.",
        "Young Olivia: Well, I think you're lying. Come on. You're not that bad. Yeah, like this.",
        "Young Jeffrey: I can't do that. I like watching you do it, though.",
        "Olivia: Stop before it's too late. You don't know what you're doing. He doesn't know. He doesn't know you're only 16. He doesn't realize you're just flirting with him! Stop it.",
        "Young Jeffrey: You know this usually isn't my scene, but... I'm kind of starting to feel it.",
        "Young Olivia: Me, too.",
        "Olivia: Stop. Go home. Go home to mommy. Go home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Get out of my way.",
        "Jeffrey: Olivia, what are you doing here?",
        "Olivia: What are you doing here? Haven't you done enough?",
        "Jeffrey: I had no idea you'd be here, in San Cristobel?",
        "Olivia: No, of course not.",
        "Jeffrey: I don't think that you heard me when I told you that that night, 20 years ago, destroyed my life as much as it did yours.",
        "Olivia: Just go away.",
        "Jeffrey: I want to figure it out. I want to know... I want to know exactly what happened, how it happened, and why.",
        "Olivia: Is your memory playing tricks on you?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, it can do that. I've heard my handler's side of the story, and yours. Neither of which seem to sync up with what I remember about that night. So that's why I'm here. I want to know the truth for me.",
        "Olivia: Hmm. Well, no matter what route you take down memory lane, Jeffrey, the view is still going to be ugly.",
        "Jeffrey: And you would know that from personal experience, right? Because, after all, that's why you're here, isn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "( Distant laughter )",
        "Young Olivia: Can we try that again? And when it feels like the world is on your shoulders and all of the madness has got you goin' crazy...",
        "Young Olivia: Hmmm, yeah, definitely a good kiss.",
        "Young Jeffrey: Definitely a good party.",
        "Young Olivia: ( Laughs )",
        "Jeffrey: No. No, don't. Don't give her that. Don't give her that. She's already drunk, you idiot. Can't you see that? And she's under age. She's only 16. Just get away from her. Just get away from her now.",
        "Young Jeffrey: To the old neighborhood.",
        "Young Olivia: And bad dancers. ( Laughs )",
        "Young Jeffrey: I'm not lousy at everything.",
        "Jeffrey: Just put her in a cab. Just take her home, or just walk away. Just don't... don't do this. You. You were here that night. I didn't remember seeing you, but you saw us, didn't you? You saw us; you saw everything. So stop it. You can see where this is going. It's obvious. You know it's wrong.",
        "Young Olivia: ( Laughing )",
        "Young Jeffrey: You okay?",
        "Young Olivia: My head's getting all fuzzy all of a sudden. I think I better lay down.",
        "Young Jeffrey: Let's go up. We'll find a room. ( Laughter )",
        "Jeffrey: No, wait wait! Come back! Don't! To the beat of the rhythm of the night dance until the morning light forget about the worries on your mind we can leave them all behind...",
        "Jeffrey: You son of a bitch. You wanted this to happen, didn't you? You were just waiting for me to make one more mistake, and then you knew you would have me. You could have stopped this. You could have stopped this whole thing from happening.",
        "Ditkins: Only I didn't. Maybe that makes me scum, but you're the one who got that girl loaded, you're the one who took advantage of it. No one forced you to do it. So you have only yourself to blame.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Young Olivia: I think I need to lie down.",
        "Young Jeffrey: Let's go find a room then. Relax, a place to lie down. What more could you ask for?",
        "Jeffrey: Why didn't I stop?",
        "Young Jeffrey: Because she was hot. Dude, come on, a chick like that, nobody would stop.",
        "Jeffrey: She was just a kid.",
        "Young Jeffrey: She didn't look like one, she didn't sound like one, she definitely didn't kiss like one. Who's idea was it to lay down? Mine? No, hers.",
        "Jeffrey: And if it was her idea to jump in front of a bus, would you do that, too?",
        "Young Jeffrey: Probably. And I was drunk.",
        "Jeffrey: And so was she. That's why she wanted to lay down, you idiot. She needed to rest. She didn't need to have sex with you.",
        "Young Jeffrey: Then I guess she change her mind. Because when I kissed her, she didn't say no. So I went for it.",
        "Jeffrey: You're a damn fool.",
        "Young Jeffrey: Yeah, what would you have done if you were me? Right, you are me. And we both know what you would have done, because you've never put the brakes on for any chick.",
        "Jeffrey: You don't know anything.",
        "Young Jeffrey: Face it, dude, if she doesn't say no, neither do we. It's just the way we're wired.",
        "Jeffrey: Ah!",
        "Olivia: I left my...",
        "Jeffrey: Olivia, wait. I'm so sorry. I never... just, please. Let me say this. I have to say this. I'm so sorry. I never meant to hurt you. And that's what I did. I was young and stupid and drunk, and I couldn't think about anything except for what would make me feel good. And what I could get away with.",
        "Olivia: ( Crying ) Stop.",
        "Jeffrey: I made a terrible mistake. I'm sorry.",
        "Olivia: We both did. ( Sobbing ) I'm sorry. I'm sorry I lied to get into that party. I'm sorry I didn't open my damn mouth and say that I was only 16. I'm sorry that I kissed you. I'm even sorrier that I wanted to. Because I did. God help me, I was so desperate to feel grown up and be free of my mother. And as crappy in life, I was so convinced she was trying to keep me trapped in. I just wanted to feel alive, alive and on my own. So I showed up that night and I flashed a lot of skin and I drank a lot and I said a lot of things that I shouldn't have to prove I was me, that I could make things happen. And I did, I made things happen. I went to that room with you. And I couldn't make it stop. ( Sobbing ) No, don't. Stop! ( Sobbing )",
        "Jeffrey: Do you ever find yourself thinking that there really is no limit to how much human beings can hurt each other and themselves?",
        "Olivia: I've had that thought every day for the past 20 years.",
        "Jeffrey: And sorry, well, that's not enough in the face of pain like that. Is it? It's just words, but if I could go back somehow and change it...",
        "Olivia: you can't. It's just more words isn't it? Nobody can go back and with all of the apologies in the world, it doesn't change the fact that that night killed someone.",
        "Jeffrey: The person you hoped to be.",
        "Olivia: My mother. You know I haven't been back in this house for years. I just felt too guilty to walk through the door. I just go on and on in here. About how awful you were, what a drag you were, how strict you were. And after you were gone, who was left to be the hard nosed mom? Me. It was only then that I had realized what you had to go through all those years. I also found out that when you were calling me difficult that you were right. Just ask all of my ex-husbands. I'm a disaster with men, mommy. I had been counting on a man to just magically appear and rescue me from my pathetic little life and here I am, sitting alone. I've either driven all of the good ones away like Josh or Bill. Or I've gone after the bad ones like Alan or Phillip. And now I'm messing things up with Buzz. Maybe he's right, maybe I'm too toxic to ever make anything work with any man.",
        "Jeffrey: maybe thinking like that is just a way of punishing yourself.",
        "Olivia: What are you doing here? Go.",
        "Jeffrey: You know you are not the only one who knows something about self loathing. I've spent my whole life running from my guilt. I changed my name, I changed addresses, I changed faces. But I could never really put any distance from me and that night.",
        "Olivia: Well, it certainly didn't turn you into a monk. You slept with half of Springfield and you seem to have your eye on the other half.",
        "Jeffrey: Why do you blame yourself for your mother's death?",
        "Olivia: Because she told me not to go. She told me there would be trouble. And then when I found out I was pregnant, there was just so much shame, she had a massive stroke.",
        "Jeffrey: But that's not your fault.",
        "Olivia: It's just a coincidence?",
        "Jeffrey: All of the shame in the world doesn't cause strokes. I mean, if your mother was destined to have one, she was going to have one even if you were going to go pray in a convent the night of that Embassy party.",
        "Olivia: I wish I had.",
        "Jeffrey: I mean, you know you're not a saint. But you're not a killer.",
        "Olivia: A saint I'm not.",
        "Jeffrey: Um... I don't know, I thought I would give this to you. Maybe it could help.",
        "Olivia: You really wear that?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, um, it's supposed to, you know, remind me that no matter how bad things get you can always turn them around. It's never too late. You just have to keep trying.",
        "Olivia: You know, maybe you would have made a good mayor. You do good speeches. I'm going home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Just...",
        "Olivia: Enough.",
        "Jeffrey: Listen to me.",
        "Olivia: You took the same flight back from San Cristobel that I did. You had your cab follow my cab all the way from the airport. I've had it.",
        "Jeffrey: I just want... I would like to help you to put your past-- our past-- behind you.",
        "Olivia: That is very nice, kind of you, unless you're really doing it for your sake.",
        "Jeffrey: What?",
        "Olivia: What? You can bring a little sunshine into my life that you darkened, and maybe somehow that will ease your famous guilt, right?",
        "Jeffrey: Not everything is a ploy, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: Since when, Jeffrey? You know what, there is something you can do for me.",
        "Jeffrey: All right.",
        "Olivia: Just stay away from Ava.",
        "Jeffrey: I don't understand...",
        "Olivia: I know that you've reached out to her or whatever it is you want to call it. Just don't do again. Okay, don't go near her.",
        "Jeffrey: Ava is not exactly clamoring to spend time with her old man.",
        "Olivia: Because she's hurt. But eventually she is going to want to know you. That is who she is. She is a terminal soft touch.",
        "Jeffrey: Some people might call her a good soul.",
        "Olivia: Well, then let her be with good people. The fact is, you don't have a right to have a relationship with her. You've known her for what, a few weeks now? I have carried that secret and shame and secrecy of my pregnancy through my entire adulthood. So if you think you can waltz right back in here and take advantage of the hell that I went through and have a relationship with your full- grown daughter, no. Jeffrey, I may have been looking for trouble that night, but you were the trouble. Come on, we're damaged people. All the more reason not to ruin another life.",
        "Jeffrey: Ava's life?",
        "Olivia: Just steer clear of her and we'll call it even. You never wanted to be a father anyway, right?",
        "Jeffrey: No.",
        "Olivia: So, do we have a deal?",
        "Jeffrey: If that will help you move on, yeah.",
        "Olivia: Yeah. Yeah, it would.",
        "Jeffrey: All right, then.",
        "Olivia: Look, whatever happened in San Cristobel, that little moment that we had, it doesn't change anything. We're not friends and we're certainly not partners of any kind. We're nothing to each other.",
        "Emma: Mommy.",
        "Olivia: Hi, baby. Oh, my gosh, did you miss me? I'm sorry. I'm sorry I had to go away. There was just something I had to do. Is that okay? Yeah? You know what? You always forgive me. Maybe Uncle Buzz will, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Open up. One, two three.",
        "Coop: I'm never going to get...",
        "Ava: Do it... give me one of those. You're horrible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Good night, sweetie. Just one more try. ( Knock on the door ) Come on, Jeffrey, leave me alone.",
        "Buzz: Hi.",
        "Olivia: You got my messages?",
