        "Ross: Think you packed enough stuff? You're \r\nonly going for one night. ",
        "Blake: It's for Cathy. A get-well goody bag.\r\n",
        "Ross: You're a good friend to her. And yet, \r\nas much as Cathy needs you, I don't want you to go. ",
        "Blake: Ross, it's just overnight. It's...\r\n",
        "Ross: Yeah, I guess you're right and I do \r\nhave a lot of work to do. But it's just that you're so irresistible that I'm \r\ngoing to miss you and I want you to hurry back, okay? Well, we better hurry or \r\nwe'll both be late. ",
        "Blake: \"We?\" ",
        "Ross: Yes, I'm meeting Tory at the office and \r\nwe're going to go over that Masterson case, of course. So, if you wait up, I can \r\nwalk you to the car. ",
        "Blake: Wait a minute. ",
        "Ross: You should go away more often. \r\n",
        "Tory: Ooh, sorry. I'll... I'll just wait \r\noutside. ",
        "Blake: No, don't be ridiculous. I was just \r\nleaving. ",
        "Ross: Yes, so was I. I thought we were \r\nmeeting at the office. ",
        "Tory: Well, there was a minor power failure.\r\n",
        "Ross: What happened? ",
        "Tory: All the computers are down. So, if \r\nwe're going to get any work done, it will have to be here. I'm just glad I \r\ncaught you in time. ",
        "Blake: I'll bet you are. ",

        "\r\nSam: Uh, yeah, I'm... From the courier service. Lickety split? Yeah, Mrs. \r\nSantos, she had an order to be picked up. But if this is the one, I'm going to \r\nhave to charge you extra, because for packaging. She told me it had to be, you \r\nknow, taped. ",
        "Maurice: You can do better than that. \r\n",
        "Sam: What the hell are you talking about, \r\nTechi-boy. You think I'm making this up? You think I'm dreaming here? Maybe he's \r\nout back. Maybe he got the wrong one. I'll go check. How's that, huh? \r\n",

        "\r\nBilly: Josh, you sure you want to go public here? ",
        "Josh: Billy, this is perfect. I feed Olivia \r\nbogus secrets. She feeds them to Alan Spaulding, right? He buys up a ton of \r\nstock before the initial public offering-- wham, the sec comes down on him and \r\nhe's swimming in hot water. ",
        "Billy: Yeah. Splashing around with Olivia. \r\nThat's if she spills. ",
        "Josh: She will. I know she will. ",
        "Billy: Josh, what if she doesn't? You got a \r\ncontingency plan? ",
        "Josh: I don't need a... I don't need a \r\ncontingency plan, Billy. Look, she's already betrayed me in the worst way \r\npossible. She slept with that pig, Alan Spaulding. Now, next to that, what's a \r\nlittle insider trading? ",
        "Billy: One more time, you sure you want to go \r\nthrough with this? Because this isn't business anymore; this is personal. \r\n",
        "Josh: Oh, no, it's not personal anymore. This \r\nis payback. ",

        "\r\nReva: \"And on New Year's Eve, Thomas Edison of the United States, better known \r\nas the wizard of Menlo Park, gave his first demonstration of the electric light \r\nbulb, illuminating his laboratory and all the streets in the surrounding area, \r\nto the delight of thousands.\" What do you think about that? ",
        "Esme: What do I think? ",
        "Reva: Well, yes. You have a mind, don't you, \r\nEsme? ",
        "Esme: Well, I'm just a girl. ",
        "Reva: Yes, but you're a very bright, little \r\ngirl, with a mind that could be full of so much more than just flower arranging \r\nand needlepoint. ",
        "Constance: That's quite enough! Esme, dear, \r\ngo wait for me upstairs. What kind of nonsense are you trying to fill my \r\ndaughter's head with? ",
        "Reva: The kind of practical information \r\nshe'll need to get her through her life. ",
        "Constance: Well, let me impart some practical \r\ninformation to you, to save you from being dismissed. Esme is connected to the \r\nRoyal House of Windsor. It's your job to assist in her upbringing, not fill her \r\nhead with matters that must be left to gentlemen. If you're not up to the task, \r\nwe'll find someone who is. ",
        "Reva: Corset a little tight, M'Lady? \r\n",
        "Constance: Mind your tongue, Miss Shayne.\r\n",
        "Reva: I don't think it's my influence on Esme \r\nthat bothers you. ",
        "Constance: I have no idea what you're talking \r\nabout. ",
        "Reva: Really? It seems to me you're going to \r\ngreat lengths to keep me and the gameskeeper apart. ",
        "Constance: (Scoffs) I don't have to defend \r\nmyself to you. ",
        "Reva: Perhaps you should defend yourself to \r\nyour husband. ",
        "Constance: Whatever crude thoughts you may be \r\ninsinuating, I'm afraid they're lost on me. ",
        "Reva: Really? ",
        "Constance: Something is very clear. Your \r\nunconventional beliefs make you unfit to guide my children through their \r\neducation, therefore, you're dismissed! ",
        "Reva: Then I shouldn't worry about telling \r\nyou precisely what I think of you. ",
        "Arthur: Dismissed? Who? ",
        "Constance: I have chosen to fire the \r\ngoverness. ",
        "Arthur: What could she have done in one day?\r\n",
        "Reva: Nothing, yet, sir. ",
        "Arthur: What is your reason? ",
        "Constance: I'm afraid she's engaged in \r\nforbidden behavior. ",
        "Arthur: Speak plainly. ",
        "Constance: I believe she has a suitor. \r\n",
        "Arthur: And what if she does? What a servant \r\ndoes in their own leisure time is of little importance, as long as it does not \r\ninterfere with their job, or spill over into our home. The new governess will be \r\nlet off with a stiff warning, but she will remain. This household suffers from \r\ntoo many comings and goings of late. ",
        "Reva: Thank you, sir. But why would you \r\nchoose to defend a poor governess that you barely know? ",
        "Arthur: Because, my dear, I have plans for \r\nyou. ",
        "",
        "\r\nJosh: Thank you. The thing that makes this is so hard is that I loved her. In \r\nthe beginning, I loved her, or at least I thought I did. But I guess I'll get \r\nover it. ",
        "Billy: Hey, don't expect too much of \r\nyourself. Heartbreak lingers. ",
        "Josh: This is not heartbreak, I'm angry, \r\nBilly. ",
        "Billy: You got every right to be angry.\r\n",
        "Josh: Not at Olivia. I'm angry at myself.\r\n",
        "Billy: Why? Because you trusted your wife?\r\n",
        "Josh: Because I made her my wife in the first \r\nplace. Billy, it took everything I had to walk away from Reva. To look her in \r\nthe eyes and to say to her, this is what I want, and I'm going to give up \r\neverything to get it. ",
        "Billy: Yeah, that did take courage. \r\n",
        "Josh: I thought I was going to get what I \r\nneeded-- trust, love, sanity. ",
        "Billy: Josh, Josh, you were taking a chance.\r\n",
        "Josh: But for what? Look at what I did to my \r\nkids, Billy. To Shayne, I mean, with everything he's going through. And Marah, \r\nand what about you? Why don't you just say it, I know what's going on inside \r\nyour head. I know you never liked Olivia. Why don't you just say, \"Josh, I told \r\nyou so.\" ",
        "Billy: Because I wouldn't do that to you \r\nwhile you're down. And besides, you do it to yourself good enough. Look who's \r\ncoming. ",
        "Olivia: Hi. ",
        "Josh: Hey. ",

Look, I got some information. \r\nI got some stuff you need, I swear. Just... But if you call in the troops, I'm \r\ngoing to sit on it, man. If you let me go I'll tell you, if you want to listen. \r\nYou understand? You understand? ",

        "Felicia: Sorry I'm late. I'm glad to finally \r\npin you down, busy girl. I'm making this \"check up on my kids week.\" ",
        "Mel: How is Remy? ",
        "Felicia: Well, I found him hiding out with \r\nhis music appreciation paper. ",
        "Mel: Oh, music appreciation. Not exactly a \r\ndad-approved class. ",
        "Felicia: Ah, but this class is part of his \r\ncurriculum, whether your father likes it or not. ",
        "Mel: You know, sometimes I feel like Dad's \r\nthat John Lithgow character from \"Footloose.\" You know, the guy who stops the \r\nwhole town from dancing? ",
        "Felicia: You know your dad just wants the \r\nbest for both of you. I just... I hate to see Remy so defensive about something \r\nthat he loves. Out of nowhere, Remy got this talent and he's just so worried \r\nabout your father that he can't even enjoy it. You know, sometimes I wonder \r\nabout you and your brother. I mean, you live your lives like you're going to be \r\ngraded on them. You put so much pressure on yourselves. And I really feel that \r\nit's your father and me who have set the bar. We have made you both feel like \r\nyou have to be perfect and I hate that. ",
        "Mel: Well, mom, today is your lucky day, \r\nbecause I am giving up on perfect. ",
        "Felicia: Work problems? ",
        "Mel: Life problems. And it's funny that you \r\nshould mention work first, because that's what I've been trying to do-- work \r\nfirst, life second, up until now. Oh, Mom, you wouldn't understand. You and Dad \r\ndid it right. You met, fell in love, got married, had us. No complications.\r\n",
        "Felicia: Oh, ho, ho, honey, what have we done \r\nto you, making you think that we've just sailed through life with no problems?\r\n",
        "Mel: Well, you did. ",
        "Felicia: It wasn't like that. As a matter of \r\nfact, your father almost ruined my whole life. ",
        "Mel: Mom? ",
        "Felicia: Before I met your dad, I was engaged \r\nto be married to a very nice young man named John Madison. ",
        "Mel: You were engaged to someone other than \r\nDad? ",
        "Felicia: Yes, we were high school \r\nsweethearts, no, grade school, really. We grew up in the same neighborhood, \r\nright next door to each other. Our parents were best friends. Our mothers were \r\npregnant at the same time. Your grandmother used to say it was destiny. \r\n",
        "Mel: So, what happened? ",
        "Felicia: Your father happened. It was \r\nsupposed to be one date and... Well, my best friend in college, she had this mad \r\ncrush on the captain of the football team. And I guess the Gods finally had \r\nmercy on her during homecoming and he asked her out on a date. Only he wanted to \r\ndouble with someone else. ",
        "Mel: Dad. ",
        "Felicia: Exactly. And I told him right from \r\nthe start, I said I'm taken, but I don't know, something just happened between \r\nthat first dance and the last. ",
        "Mel: Magic? ",
        "Felicia: No. It was awful. He was awful. I \r\nmean, he spilled a drink all over my dress. He said all the wrong things. But, I \r\ndon't know, at the end of the night, I... I just knew that I couldn't go through \r\nwith my marriage. ",
        "Mel: Why? ",
        "Felicia: Well, because something happened in \r\nthat one night that I hadn't felt in my whole entire life. I mean, I got angrier \r\nand sadder and laughed louder than I ever had. And I really think it's because \r\nyour father challenged me on so many levels. And I knew that that was something \r\nI had never had with John. ",
        "Mel: Wow. So, what are you saying? Are you \r\nsaying that I should chase after Rick? ",
        "Felicia: No, I'm just saying that you \r\nshouldn't shut down your feelings because you feel like you've met the right \r\nperson at the wrong time. You have to go through with this... ",
        "Mel: Oh, but, Mom... ",
        "Felicia: ...And face it. ",
        "Mel: ...I am such a mess. I can't stop \r\nthinking about a man who belongs to someone else. You're my mom. Aren't you \r\nsupposed to say something like, \"I\u2019ll take the pain away if I could?\" \r\n",
        "Felicia: Oh, honey, when you were little, \r\nevery year for Halloween, you were a doctor. ",
        "Mel: I knew what I wanted to be. ",
        "Felicia: And you always knew. And you went \r\nafter everything that you ever wanted-- every competition, every spelling bee.\r\n",
        "Mel: You're complaining? ",
        "Felicia: No, but I'm... I'm saying that it's \r\ngood for you to go through something that wasn't on your to do list, that you \r\nmade when you were seven years old. ",

        "Tory: Well, she has a hard time being away \r\nfrom you. Can't say that I blame her. ",
        "Ross: All right, let's get down to this \r\nbecause in the written statement, somehow we overlooked something. Where is \r\nthis? Oh, yes. Right here and I quote, \"I got a look, but then I put on my \r\nglasses to get a better look.\" ",
        "Tory: So, you think we can discredit her \r\ntestimony? ",
        "Ross: You read my mind-- again. Miss Granger, \r\nyou must stop doing that. ",
        "Ross: So, here's what we do. We got a hold of \r\nher optometrist and hope that he can corroborate our theory. ",
        "Tory: Yes, because that witness without her \r\nglasses is absolutely useless. ",
