        "Harley: Well, look at it this way, babe, whatever she knows about you never hit cyberspace, so it can't hurt you now. Right?",

        "Mallet: What, I'm shirtless?",
        "Dinah: Okay, Ashlee, clearly my mom has lost it. I don't know why she sent you here. Mallet does not want to be a star. He doesn't want anything to do with this. He's not even camera friendly, anyway.",
        "Mallet: Excuse me.",

        "Gus: There's not one piece of paper in this whole place with my name on it. Do you realize that?",
        "Harley: Maybe what she knows about you is so bad, so damaging, that she didn't put it on paper. Oh no, she kept it up here.",
        "Gus: I don't have a big, bad secret. I would remember.",
        "Harley: Well I'm not saying this in a bad way, but you were on drugs all those months.",

        "Jonathan: So we went from Fairy Princess to Penelope. You named her Penelope?",
        "Alan: Yes, Penelope was my mother's name. Jonathan, you know I have tried to give you the benefit of the doubt.",
        "Jonathan: For two seconds.",
        "Alan: That's all it took for you to go racing off in a snow storm and smash your car, it's a miracle that Elizabeth and that baby aren't dead.",
        "Jonathan: No, it wasn't a miracle.",
        "Alan: Oh, I'm sure it was because of you and Tammy, the power of your love.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, you know, you got me Alan. You got me. Tammy and I set the whole thing off, the snow, the car accident, giving birth in my front seat just to piss you off.",
        "Lizzie: Not again.",
        "Beth: I will see what it's about. Lizzie...",
        "Lizzie: Granddad, what are you doing?",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, you are supposed to be in that bed.",
        "Lizzie: What is going on?",
        "Jonathan: Nothing, we're fine.",
        "Lizzie: Jonathan, I can handle this.",
        "Jonathan: Here.",
        "Lizzie: You're filing for custody of Penelope Randall Spaulding? You're unbelievable.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, I'm not going to take the baby away from you.",
        "Lizzie: Did you know about this?",
        "Beth: No, no...",
        "Alan: Your mother wants what's best for you, just like I do, and it's obvious that...",
        "Jonathan: Well, it's obvious that we can't keep fighting like this, right? It's not good for Lizzie and the baby.",
        "Alan: Why, what are you proposing?",
        "Jonathan: Well, somebody has got to give up something, and that means me.",
        "Lizzie: Please tell me that you're not giving into him. What, are you just going to walk away from me and the baby?",
        "Jonathan: Calm... calm down. It's obvious what great gramps wants is to make sure you and the kid are okay. That's what I want, too, right? It's pretty simple. I think we move into the big house with you and you.",
        "Lizzie: What?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Look, if that's what it takes to prove that I'm going to put the kid first and you guys are going to be okay, then I can stand to be waited on hand and foot by all those servants.",
        "Beth: I think that that is quite a concession. Thank you, Jonathan. Now even you have to admit that.",
        "Alan: So you want to move into the mansion?",
        "Jonathan: Not really but if it means you'll get off our backs. You on board? Yes.",
        "Beth: All's well that ends well. Great, okay. Now you need to get back into bed. And don't worry, we will have everything set by the time you get home. Let's go.",
        "Lizzie: Bye. How could you do something like that?",
        "Jonathan: Shh.",
        "Lizzie: Don't shush me.",
        "Jonathan: Shush. Bed. Shh.",
        "Lizzie: You're out of your mind.",
        "Jonathan: Shh.",
        "Lizzie: Is something wrong with the baby.",
        "Lillian: Yeah, honey, and it sounds much scarier than it is.",
        "Lizzie: What?",
        "Jonathan: Lillian?",
        "Lillian: The baby has a heart murmur.",
        "Lizzie: Oh my God. What is that?",
        "Lillian: It's not life- threatening, sweetie. In most cases it clears up by itself. Had the pediatrician take a look at her and he's going to come in and explain it to you.",
        "Lizzie: What should we do? Should we take her to a specialist?",
        "Lillian: I don't know that that's necessary, but I do know a really good pediatric cardiologist in Chicago.",
        "Jonathan: Then we're going to Chicago.",
        "Lillian: Don't you want to hear what this doctor has to say?",
        "Jonathan: No, no, we're not going to take any chances. We'll go to Chicago.",
        "Lillian: Okay, I'm on your side in this. I'll go make the referral.",
        "Lizzie: I'm going to get dressed.",
        "Jonathan: Get dressed. We're not going to Chicago, and we're not moving into that mausoleum of a house.",
        "Lizzie: The baby has to get checked out.",
        "Jonathan: The baby's going to get checked out, of course. But not anywhere where Alan can get his hands on her.",

        "Mallet: I'm sorry. Sorry. That girl, Ashlee, she's been trailing me all morning like some kind of Louisiana bloodhound.",
        "Dinah: Well, honey, you don't have to worry about her anymore. Or your newfound legions of fans.",
        "Mallet: I don't?",
        "Dinah: No.",
        "Mallet: Why not?",

        "Mallet: Yeah, you called your momma and got my canned. Yes, to straightening things out. No, to getting me axed.",

        "Dinah: This is all your fault, Mom.",

        "Dinah: Get ratings.",
        "Vanessa: Wait, wait, wait. Both of you, wait. Mallet, your show is good. It's a bonafide hit. There's no question about that. But sweetheart, the station is really excited about your idea. And we can't do both of them, not in the long run.",
        "Dinah: Why? I don't understand.",
        "Vanessa: Well, this is what we're going to do: We're going to air them both on the same night and we're going to let the audience decide.",

        "Beth: A heart murmur?",
        "Alan: Lillian, how serious is it?",
        "Lillian: Alan, you can calm down. It's probably nothing, but the doctor in Chicago will know for sure.",
