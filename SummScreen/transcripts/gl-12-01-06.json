        "Ava: Right there. See? ",

        "Ava: ( Laughs ) You're so predictable. I can retire on the money I would get \r\nif I sued you for sexual harassment, you little jerk. ",
        "Alan-Michael: ( Laughs ) Well, that's the first smile I've seen out of you in \r\nweeks. So it will be worth it. ",

        "Reva: Did you say goodbye to your daddy yet? ",

        "Marah: You know exactly what is happening, Mom. You and I know I wouldn't \r\neven be leaving if I thought that there was still the slightest chance of you \r\nand dad getting back together. But I think I finally realized that there isn\u2019t.\r\n",

        "Cassie: Do you miss doing this for the kids? ",
        "Josh: Well, I kind of got the sense that Marah wouldn't want to be \r\ncelebrating with me right now, so... ",
        "Cassie: No, perhaps not. She laid into us pretty good, didn't she? ",
        "Josh: Yeah. But, hey, at least she was fair about it, you know? She went out \r\nafter you as much as she went after me, so that actually made me feel better.",
        "Cassie: Well thank you.",
        "Josh: I'm kidding. We survived, we got through it, and I hate having to put \r\nit that way. ",

        "Beth: They missed the baby's appointment? ",
        "Alan: They didn't make an appointment. For all I know, they're not even in \r\nChicago. Jonathan had-- just a trick. ",

        "Alan: Jonathan does not love Elizabeth. He loves one person, and she is \r\nsitting right over there. She knows where he is. ",
        "Beth: So what are you going to do? Are you going to go over there and find \r\nout where Lizzie is, then send some thugs to bring them home? ",

        "Ava: Do I look like an arm wrestler? ",
        "Alan-Michael: All right, what can you do? Cards, flip cup, what is your \r\nhidden talent? ",
        "Ava: My hidden talent is eating really fast. ",
        "Alan-Michael: That's not exactly a marketable skill. ",
        "Ava: It is if you're a waitress. ",
        "Ava: I can take an entire handful of potato chips and cram them in my mouth \r\nand swallow them without choking. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Impressive. ",
        "Ava: It's very efficient. It is impressive. I'm proud. I'll show you how to \r\ndo it. Are you ready? Okay, you start out with a handful. There you go. That \r\nwill work. Take those. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Okay, one, two, three, go. ",

        "Josh: Yeah, I'm sorry. ",
        "Hal: It's not your fault. I'm used to it. I get around just fine. A few \r\nmonths ago, I had to go for surgery, so I went to your fancy new vet hospital in \r\nOklahoma and everything worked out fine. I'm supposed to go back there soon for \r\na new leg, as a matter of fact. ",
        "Josh: That's great. I mean, wow, I'd love to take some credit for that, \r\nbut... ",
        "Hal: No. But the big thing that made it bearable was the fact that my family \r\ncould come down and stay with me. They stayed in the family quarters right next \r\nto the hospital. They got to visit me everyday. And that meant more than you'll \r\never know. So thank you. They thank you, too. You've done me and a lot of guys \r\nlike me a great service. Now I know what sacrifice really means, and there's no \r\nway you could have built that hospital without giving up something great. I \r\ndon't know what it was, but it was worth it. A change in life is for the good, \r\nand I'm living proof of that. So, again, thanks. ",

        "Reva: You can design clothes here, or New York is even closer. ",

        "Ava: Just like that? ",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, just like that. It sounds like you had a wonderful mom, and I \r\nhave no right to screw up the wonderful parentage you've already had. So I think \r\nwe should just go back to the way things were, the way our lives were, like we \r\nbarely know each other. ",

The pain and loneliness of death by herself so we \r\nwouldn't have the burden of having to face it with her. Is there anything more \r\nselfless than that? Is there any greater gift than that?
