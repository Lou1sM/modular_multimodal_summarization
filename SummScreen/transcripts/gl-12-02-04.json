        "Tony: Do I have a choice?",
        "Michelle: Not unless you want to make a life down here.",
        "Tony: All right. Look, Ma, no hands. (laughs)",
        "Michelle: How's the knee? How does it feel?",
        "Tony: It's good. It's just swell. It's just swell. Good.",
        "Michelle: All right, that's enough for now. Come on. Come on.",
        "Tony: All right. Okay. Okay, I got it.",
        "Michelle: You all right?",
        "Tony: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So about... about starting a life down here. Hmm?",
        "Michelle: How about a distraction?",
        "Tony: Well, I'm easy.",
        "Michelle: (Screams)",
        "Tony: What? What? What?",
        "Michelle: Creepy crawly on a clock.",
        "Tony: Get out of here. Get out of here. Go. Go. Go. See. Look. He's gone. He's going away. It's all right. It's okay.",
        "Michelle: All right.",

        "Danny: Hey, you.",

        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Mel: How are you doing? How's everything?",
        "Danny: Good. Good.",
        "Mel: Yeah?",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Mel: How's Robbie?",

        "Mel: Good.",
        "Danny: How are you?",
        "Mel: Good.",
        "Danny: Good. (Danny/Mel) so...",
        "Mel: I guess you haven't heard anything from Michelle.",
        "Danny: No. Why should I? She ran away with Tony.",
        "Mel: That's one way to look at it.",
        "Danny: There's another?",
        "Mel: The other is that you drove her away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Hey.",
        "Beth: Hey. Are you here for questioning, too?",
        "Rick: Yeah, I jut got finished. Nothing like reliving the worst night of your life.",
        "Beth: It's so sad, Rick. At the end of his life Phillip hurt every person up on that board. And that's all some of them will ever remember about him.",
        "Rick: And most of them had a motive to kill him.",
        "Frank: Standard procedure.",
        "Olivia: I didn't kill Phillip, Frank. Come on. Why would I? Things are finally going right in my life. I'm out of the Spaulding snake pit. Bill and I are married. I'm happier than I've been in ages. Why would I do something to screw it up?",
        "Frank: Well, maybe Phillip had one last thing to use against you.",
        "Olivia: What is this? I can explain this.",
        "Frank: Olivia, I know what stock fraud is.",
        "Olivia: How did you get this?",
        "Frank: Alan gave us access to all of Phillip's files. Now, Olivia, I'm only going to ask you one time. Exactly what were you doing the night that Phillip was murdered?",
        "Olivia: Why bother with formalities, Frank? Why don't you just cuff me and get it over with?",
        "Buzz: (Laughing) You know, ironic, isn't it? Every time we try to separate from the Spaulding's, they just hold us tighter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: I'm so glad you find this amusing, Dad.",
        "Coop: Well, who wouldn't want to hang out with us?",
        "Marina: Lizzie doesn't want to hang out. She wants to run this family and run this place into the ground. I can't believe we're all walking on eggshells, because that little witch...",
        "Buzz: Hey, whoa.",
        "Marina: Rat.",
        "Buzz: She's late.",
        "Coop: No, she's here. Show time.",
        "Lizzie: (Clears her throat)",
        "Coop: You can't bring her in here.",
        "Lizzie: Sure I can. I own it.",
        "Coop: Okay. So you can tell that to the board of health.",
        "Lizzie: Sweetie, don't listen to him. You're better groomed than he is.",
        "Buzz: Hello, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Hi, Buzz. Okay, since everybody's here, let's get the show on the road, shall we? Hold her for me, please.",
        "Harley: Well, I don't believe it. The Lizzie doll actually comes complete with her own attorney.",
        "Gus: Hold on a second. No, I was just giving her a ride. The kid doesn't even have a license. Okay. And I just came for a cup of coffee.",
        "Harley: Of course. Sure. Sure.",
        "Gus: Good. Good. If you think I have anything to do with what she's doing here at Company, you're wrong. You guys can duke that out, okay. I'll stay in my corner; you stay in your corner. Got it?",
        "Harley: That's the way it is.",
        "Gus: That's the way it is.",
        "Harley: Because of what happened the other night at the bar. That wasn't real remember?",
        "Gus: Sure do. Not real. And I'll stay out of the murder investigation as well.",
        "Harley: Well, I never asked you to get mixed up in that in the first place.",
        "Gus: No, you didn't. Good. So I'm done. I don't have to help out. And I'll help myself to a cup of coffee, okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Mel: Look, all I'm saying is that Tony accepts Michelle for who she is. You said you could do that, but you didn't.",
        "Danny: Where...",
        "Mel: I'm not saying you didn't try, but...",
        "Danny: Where is this coming from? You know that all I wanted was for Michelle to be okay.",
        "Mel: She's okay.",
        "Danny: Mel.",
        "Mel: She is okay. Look I miss the old Michelle, too. And so does Rick.",
        "Danny: Mm-hmm.",
        "Mel: But if we want her in our lives, we have to forget about the past no matter how great it was. It's never going to be the same.",
        "Danny: Well, I'm already there. I'm moving on with my life. And not just for Robbie, but for me.",
        "Mel: Well, I'm not saying to forget your marriage.",
        "Danny: There is no marriage, Mel. It took me awhile to get that. And believe me, I didn't want to lose Michelle or live my life without her, but I did and I am.",
        "Mel: Wow. I'm sorry.",
        "Danny: I'm okay.",
        "Mel: It's terrible when something's happens to get in between two people and you try, but you can't get through to the person you love.",
        "Danny: Are you okay?",
        "Mel: Yeah, I'll be okay.",
        "Danny: Yeah?",
        "Mel: Listen. Call me next week and we can get the kids together.",
        "Danny: Yeah. All right.",
        "Mel: Okay?",
        "Danny: Sounds good.",
        "Mel: All right, bye, sweetie.",
        "Danny: Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Oh, thanks.",
        "Rick: It doesn't go away, Beth. Every single morning I wake up with this knot in my stomach.",
        "Beth: I go into the study every morning and I expect to see Phillip there pouring coffee. First one up, already at work.",
        "Rick: You know, I read this article in the newspaper about the CEO that was cheating his employees and I went right to that phone to call him. I used to just love getting into these arguments with him about corporate greed. I just miss him. I just miss those fights.",
        "Beth: James had a nightmare the other night. And I said to myself in the morning, I'm going to yell at Phillip for telling him all those scary stories.",
        "Rick: Right.",
        "Beth: Then I remembered. You know, you can fight with me anytime you want.",
        "Rick: Oh, good. I'll tell you scary stories sometimes if you want. I've got to go. I have a dinner reservation with my wife. Why don't you join us?",
        "Beth: Oh, thanks. But I can't. I have a few things I have to go over with Frank.",
        "Rick: Well, seducing a police chief will get you nowhere.",
        "Beth: Ah. Then you've tried it already.",
        "Rick: (Laughs slightly) That was a pun. Nice try.",
        "Beth: (Laughs) Get out of here.",
        "Rick: Bye.",
        "Beth: Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: That night I arrived at Company after Phillip was shot. Did I hate him enough to do it? You bet. And I'm sad that he's out of my life? Not even close. And now he's trying to destroy me from the grave.",
        "Frank: Olivia, didn't you try to destroy him by making him believe that Phillip's child had died?",
        "Olivia: I did what I did to protect my daughter, Frank. Everything I have done has been for Emma.",
        "Frank: Everything?",
        "Olivia: Come on. Come on, Frank, you know me.",
        "Frank: Yeah, I do. And I like you. But I have a job to do.",
        "Olivia: Someone has poisoned your mind against me, haven't they, Frank? Who is it?",
        "Frank: Olivia, you have nothing to hide. What are you worried about?",
        "Olivia: You know what? I should have known that I wouldn't get justice in this town, because the Spaulding's run everything.",
        "Frank: You can go now. But I don't want you leaving town. Because I will be talking to you again.",
        "Beth: Hello, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: It was you, wasn't it? You're the one who's trying to pin this mess on me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: I can't believe I feel so perfectly happy. Everything around us is a screaming danger.",
        "Tony: I'm happy, too, you know. In fact, I don't know if I even want to go home.",
        "Michelle: What?",
        "Tony: I'm serious. You know we could... I don't know. We could stay here.",
        "Michelle: You're nuts. We can't live in the jungle.",
        "Tony: I don't mean here in this spot. I mean here just in general. When we find Holly, we can get her safely off the island. You and I could... I don't know. We could stay here and start a life. What do you say?",
        "Michelle: I think people might call that running away.",
        "Tony: Well, who cares what they call it. As long as you and I are happy.",
        "Michelle: Are you afraid you're going to lose me if we go back to Springfield?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Anyway, so I had my granddad's assistant make up an agenda for us. Would you like to take a look?",
        "Harley: So, you're really going to let me handle my father and Ruth my way?",
        "Gus: I was just trying to help you.",
        "Harley: No, I know. I know.",
        "Gus: You don't want me to do it I won't do it. You know, I respect that.",
        "Harley: Hey, for the record, I'm really glad that we had that night in the bar.",
        "Gus: Yeah, look, I really hope it works out for you and your dad, okay.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, so I had a designer at Spaulding create these for me. Here you are.",
        "Buzz: What are they?",
        "Lizzie: And here you go. They're the new menus.",
        "Buzz: Oh.",
        "Marina: Pink?",
        "Coop: Elizabeth and Company.",
        "Lizzie: Now if you would turn to page one, you'd see that I added a couple new entrees. My favorite is the sour cream and caviar omelet, but you know.",
        "Harley: What is going on here?",
        "Buzz: Menu reform.",
        "Lizzie: May I remind you not to be late. This is our first staff meeting.",
        "Harley: I'm not staff. I'm just here to help my family reason with you.",
        "Lizzie: About what?",
        "Marina: We want our restaurant back, lizard.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, that's so silly. I'm not giving it back. My dad got this for me.",
        "Marina: As a joke, or as punishment. Not because he really cared how you ran it.",
        "Buzz: Lizzie, you know, I know how much you want to honor your father's memory, but you really don't know how tough it is to keep this place up and running.",
        "Lizzie: My dad gave me Company out of love, okay. I'm going to make it into something that he would be proud of. You know, I don't get you people. Don't you understand a father wanting to take care of his daughter? That's the whole reason why you sold Company in the first place, isn't it? You're not very different from my dad at all.",
        "Coop: Well, they're both people anyway.",
        "Buzz: Excuse me.",
        "Harley: Daddy? Do you need your pills?",
        "Buzz: No.",
        "Harley: Don't let her do this to you.",
        "Buzz: It's not Lizzie. It's not even losing the place.",
        "Harley: Then what?",
        "Buzz: It's me. I tried to make this right for...",
        "Harley: Okay, you know what? Don't explain. On second thought I know. And I don't blame you.",
        "Buzz: You don't?",
        "Harley: No. It will work out, okay? You have to trust me. It'll be okay. All of it.",
        "Gus: All right. All you Cooper's stay here and I'll do what I got to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Look at you. The thought of going back to Springfield, you're already breaking into a sweat.",
        "Tony: Can you blame me? (Laughs) I had to get you on a deserted island before you'd even take notice.",
        "Michelle: Oh, I noticed.",
        "Tony: But you also wanted to see how hard I would work, right?",
        "Michelle: You know it's funny because I was trying so hard to figure out who I was and what I wanted. And the whole time the answer was right there in front of me. You know, I only feel like me when I'm with you. You were the first voice I heard. You were the first arms that held me. Being with you is like coming home. There's nothing that's going to keep us from being together, Tony. I just can't believe I took so long to figure this out.",
        "Tony: Well, you know I would have waited for as long as it took. Come here. Come here. And you have no idea, Michelle, how many times I get on my bike and I'd end up outside that lighthouse and I would sit there and I would... I would wish that we'd have this moment, you know. Not here in the jungle, but this moment. I knew it would happen, you know. It just felt real, felt right.",
        "Michelle: It is right. And it doesn't matter whether we're here or over there, because we're going to be together no matter what.",
        "Tony: Mm-hmm. Get some sleep. We got a big day tomorrow.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Okay, so Roxie and I need to go and straighten up a few things in the kitchen.",
        "Coop: Meeting adjourned?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, for now. Mm-hmm.",
        "Coop: We need a plan. We need a plan. How about a work slow down? How does that sound?",
        "Marina: A strike sounds better.",
        "Coop: Okay.",
        "Marina: We could get a picket line going.",
        "Coop: I like where you're going with this. This is... this is crazy. Hopefully, we will get Lizzie to hand the restaurant back over to Dad. So, the more trouble that we cause...",
        "Marina: The better.",
        "Coop: Absolutely.",
        "Danny: I will have the little white dog burger, medium rare, cheddar cheese. And if you guys really want force Lizzie out of here, you're going about it the entirely wrong way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: You have been waiting for your chance to get back at me haven't you? Trying to make me look guilty for Phillip's murder.",
        "Beth: I don't have to lift a finger to make you look guilty, Olivia. Emma's father is dead. Do you even care?",
        "Olivia: Would he have cared if someone had shot me?",
        "Beth: You know something. There is so much hate and anger inside of you; it wouldn't surprise me in the least if you killed Phillip. And if you did, trust me, I'll be the first one in line to pull the switch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: I'm starting to understand what Phillip was going through.",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Buzz: He kept doing things, you know, making choices... big choices in the name of protecting his family. It blew up in his face.",
        "Harley: All right, don't do that. You are nothing like Phillip Spaulding. You never set out to hurt anybody, did you? Daddy, did you? All right, stop that. Stop talking in circles and just level with me. I'm onto you. I know you're not being honest with us, okay? I think you're in some kind of big trouble here. And I want to help you, but I can't do it if all you do is throw out these little bits and pieces that don't add up to anything.",
        "Buzz: I don't want your help! I don't... I'm supposed to just... leave it alone.",
        "Maria: You need to talk to her, by the way. Make sure he does.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, I can't handle this today. I've got to go over to the police station. (Sighs)",
        "Harley: Really? Actually, I was just on my way over there. Why don't I give you a lift?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: All right, Buzz. Where would you hide evidence?",
        "Buzz: What the hell do you think you're doing?",
        "Gus: Well, you first. What's the story?",
        "Buzz: Breaking and entering is a crime, you know.",
        "Gus: So is hiding evidence.",
        "Buzz: Evidence? You think I killed Phillip?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: All a strike will accomplish is it will shut this place down, lose this place of money, and send people to another restaurant for their burgers.",
        "Marina: So, what do you suggest?",
        "Coop: Besides Lizzie sleeping with the fish tonight.",
        "Danny: You know, only Marina's allowed to make jokes about my past.",
        "Coop: Is it really past?",
        "Marina: Please ignore him. So, what's the plan?",
        "Danny: It's easy. You've just got to figure out what Lizzie's weak spot is, what really makes her crazy.",
        "Coop: It's not being in control.",
        "Danny: Okay, so, you go for that. Use it.",
        "Marina: How?",
        "Danny: Give her total, complete control of Company. Follow all of her orders to a T.",
        "Marina: Okay, that is the worst idea I've heard yet.",
        "Coop: No, that's actually brilliant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Being with you is like coming home. There's nothing that's going to keep us from being together.",
        "Danny: Come on, you don't really believe her, do you? She's playing you, cus, just like she played me. Cross that Springfield line and she's mine again. All mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: So, you look like you've been a very busy shopper.",
        "Mel: Yes, Christmas shopping for the kids. Oh, I have a surprise for you. I found this in my purse, the film I hadn't developed...",
        "Rick: Really.",
        "Mel: ...In a long time.",
        "Rick: This is from the barbecue. It's December.",
        "Mel: I know have you seen my purse lately?",
        "Rick: No. Look at this. Oh, my, goodness, look at Jude trying to feed Leah a hot dog. Look how small she is.",
        "Mel: She's so cute.",
        "Rick: Adorable.",
        "Mel: What's wrong?",
        "Rick: I know there's some pictures of Phillip in here. I just can't seem to find them. I know that he's in this role, because I took pictures of him and the girls. That's weird. Well, see, it's right here on the negative. They must have just messed up the print job. Or maybe you decided not to have them printed.",
        "Mel: I didn't. I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: I could call the cops and have you run in.",
        "Gus: Yeah, but you won't do that.",
        "Buzz: Breaking and entering is a crime, you know.",
        "Gus: So is hiding evidence...",
        "Buzz: Evidence? You think I killed Phillip?",
        "Gus: Buzz, everybody knows that you hated my brother. And I happen to know you turned the alarm off the night he was killed. And he was killed right downstairs in your restaurant. Or should we say Phillip's restaurant?",
        "Buzz: You're coming after me, Gus? You going to finish what your brother started?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: You know, you were just as desperate and angry as I was when you heard that Phillip had kidnapped the children. You going to deny that? And what about Rick and Harley? They were out for blood when they heard that Phillip had kidnapped Zach and Jude. But they are such nice people, aren't they? Nothing like me. There's a whole list of suspects who wanted Phillip dead. I may not be shedding a tear, but that doesn't mean I picked up a gun and shot him. I'm not guilty, okay? I'm not going to take the rap for this!",
        "Beth: Look around, Olivia. You've single-handedly raised the suspicions of the entire Springfield PD. Congratulations.",
        "Lizzie: Well, thank you for the ride and the lecture. It's great.",
        "Harley: We're not finished quite yet, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Yes, we are, Harley.",
        "Harley: I have known you a long time. I know the little girl who fought so hard to protect her mother. I know the little girl who fought so bravely when she was sick. And I know you wish there was more you could have done to help your father.",
        "Lizzie: My father didn't need help, okay? He knew exactly what was going on, as you people...",
        "Harley: So I know you can relate when I tell you it is my time to protect my father. He means everything to me; he means everything to this town.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, my father meant everything to me, and somebody in this town took him away. Hi, Olivia.",
        "Frank: Hey.",
        "Harley: Hi. You've got a minute for your sister?",
        "Frank: Oh, no, not really. I've got a meeting with Lizzie in a couple of minutes, so...",
        "Harley: That's okay. She's right out here. She'll wait. Um, I actually wanted to talk to you about the murder case. Now, Frank, I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but I really, really think you should let somebody else handle this.",
        "Frank: Why is that?",
        "Harley: Because I am just trying to protect you. You know, I think you're way too close to all the players in this. Look how much the Spaulding's have already hurt you this year.",

        "Marina: You want to be around Lizzie, taking orders from her all day?",
        "Coop: I don't mind it if it means the downfall of Lizzie Spaulding. What Danny's trying to say is that if we give Lizzie complete control of this restaurant she will eventually blow it.",
        "Danny: Right. It sounds like a good plan to me.",
        "Marina: Yeah, a plan that requires up to be around her 24/7, which is not happening.",
        "Coop: As long as you can keep your temper down, things should be fine.",
        "Marina: My temper? Excuse me. I'm the most even-tempered person in this place.",
        "Coop: I saw you throw that piece of feta at Anna in the kitchen. I saw it.",
        "Marina: Big deal, it was cheese.",
        "Danny: It was like an overhand.",
        "Coop: I'll tell you what, guys, I'm going to find Dad and just run this plan by him, okay?",
        "Marina: Are you serious?",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Marina: Okay, I'm not the one ??? lighthouse because he hit his thumb.",
        "Danny: What are you talking about? That was a celebratory throw.",
        "Marina: Yeah, and I suppose it was a celebratory curse you screamed out just as those old ladies were walking by.",
        "Danny: I was telling them to duck.",
        "Marina: Right, duck. I don't think that you would last five minutes on the job with Lizzie.",
        "Danny: Oh, please, you want to bet?",
        "Marina: Dinner. Loser cooks.",
        "Danny: You're on. (Clink glasses)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: You realize that she never gave you the time of day when I was around. You had to follow her to the middle of nowhere just to get her to even notice you. Of course out here she has no choice, she'll take any protection she can get.",
        "Tony: What we have is real.",
        "Danny: Yeah, and you keep telling yourself that all the way to Springfield. She is beautiful sleeping all curled up like that, isn't she?",
        "Tony: Don't touch her, Danny. Don't touch her.",
        "Danny: Okay, okay. I can wait. By the looks of you, man, it doesn't look like you'll be making it back alive. But she will. Your days are numbered, cousin.",
        "Tony: I'll make it out. I'll make it out, and so will she. And Michelle and I will be together. You lost her because you tried to make her somebody that she's not. You never treated her like a person, Danny. You made her feel like she wasn't a person. And I'll never do that to her. I want her, and I love her for who she is now.",
        "Danny: Why don't we wake sleeping beauty up and ask her what she wants.",
        "Tony: Get away!",

        "Rick: Why would you do that? Why would you try to erase my memories of Phillip?",
        "Mel: No, I'm not. I juts wanted you to have some happy memories of that day, ones that we shared. You've been so sad lately.",
        "Rick: He's my best friend. Every memory is precious you should know that.",
        "Mel: I understand. Look, I'll just take these back and have them run off.",
        "Rick: No, it's all right. I'll do it.",
        "Mel: Rick?",
        "Rick: I'll take care of it. I'll take care of it. Look at the girls' matching dresses that Phillip bought them. And there's Jude and Zach with him on a swing. We had so many plans.",
        "Mel: Rick, Rick. Look, I'm sorry, okay. But when I saw those pictures of Phillip sort of looming over Zach and Jude, it just reminded me of the kidnapping, and I guess I freaked.",

        "Gus: Frank's not going to be able to protect you when he finds out about this alarm thing. In fact, you're going to become his chief suspect. And if I was after you, Buzz, don't you think I would have told him by now? Buzz, I'm not here to help my family, I'm here to help yours. So just tell me, what's up with the shirt?",
        "Buzz: I cut my hand on a bagel cutter, and wrapped the shirt around the wound. Take the shirt. Have the blood analyzed.",
        "Gus: Buzz, I really... I hate this, okay; I hate it just as much as you do.",
        "Buzz: Excuse me if I don't believe that. Your alliances seem to shift on a regular basis. Why would you put yourself on the line for me?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: You're right, Frank. Um, I'm not just trying to protect you. I'm trying to protect all of us. Because there is not one member of this family that has not suffered under the Spaulding's. So, yeah, when you say, \"protect,\" I am...",
        "Frank: Sis, sis, leave the protecting to me. Okay? Help Zach through all of this, that's what you need to do.",
        "Harley: Well, that's the other thing. How can you be a good uncle to Zach when you are so busy here all the time caught up in this case?",
        "Frank: I promise any time with my nephew. It's not going to take much time.",
        "Harley: Why, do you have a lead?",

        "Olivia: No, he saved the third degree for you, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, come on, I have nothing to hide. You're the only one who had to gain something out of my father's death. You know, you really don't have to worry. I'll take care of Emma for you.",
        "Olivia: What the hell is that supposed to mean?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, you know, when they put you in jail for life. Don't worry; I'll take care of her. I mean, she is a Spaulding, so she should be brought up like one.",

        "Lizzie: You know I don't know how you're going to keep me from her, because you'll be in prison. Let's go, Roxie, let's go help Chief Cooper find Daddy's killer. Come on.",

        "Marina: I guess I'll give it a shot.",

        "Buzz: Alex is your family.",
