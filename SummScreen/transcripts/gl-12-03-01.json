        "Holly: Sam? Sam? Sam, can you hear me? Sam? \r\nBuzz, get out here quick. I need you. Hurry. ",
        "Buzz: Look, everybody, break it up. Sit down. \r\nShow's over. What happened? ",
        "Holly: I don't know. He was talking to me and \r\nhe fell like a stone. ",
        "Buzz: His pulse is okay. Hey, buddy. Hey.\r\n",
        "Holly: Oh, thank God. ",
        "Sam: Buzz. Hey, what am I doing here? \r\n",
        "Buzz: You're lying on my floor. This is where \r\nyou're going to stay for the next couple minutes. ",
        "Sam: (Groans) I passed out? ",
        "Holly: And how. ",
        "Buzz: The question is why? ",
        "Sam: I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m all right. I just didn't \r\neat anything yesterday. Oh, good. See, I\u2019m good. ",
        "Holly: You need to eat something. ",
        "Buzz: Lynn, can you get ice and a bag and \r\nminestrone soup with extra parmesan and crackers. ",
        "Sam: This is one way to get some service \r\naround here, hey, Buzz? No-- voila-- I\u2019m all right. No problem. ",
        "Buzz: No problem at all. ",

        "\r\nGus: You're rusty. ",
        "Harley: What are you doing here? ",
        "Gus: I was behind you the whole time. You're \r\noff the force-- what, a couple of months?-- And all of your skills go in the \r\ntoilet. ",
        "Harley: Did you tail me all the way from \r\nCompany? ",
        "Gus: Yes, I did. And then I saw you make a \r\nleft onto Coventry road. And I\u2019m thinking to myself, \"what is she doing? She \r\ndoesn't live on Coventry road. What is she doing?\" ",
        "Harley: I\u2019m picking up my kids. ",
        "Gus: Oh. ",
        "Harley: See, does that solve your little \r\nriddle for you? Can you go follow somebody else now? What? What do you want?\r\n",
        "Gus: I just... I wanted to give you \r\nsomething-- like a shoulder to cry on. ",
        "Harley: I don't see anybody here crying.\r\n",
        "Gus: Oh, you were very upset when you left \r\nCompany. ",
        "Harley: I was not... ",
        "Gus: Yes, you were. ",
        "Harley: ...Upset. ",
        "Gus: Yes, you were. And when you saw Rick \r\nkiss Mel and Mel kiss Rick, I thought you were going to faint. ",

        "\r\nRoss: What the hell were you thinking about? How could you do this? ",
        "Blake: I just had to. ",
        "Tory: Blake, can I help you with that? \r\n",
        "Ross: You were spying on Tory and me like we \r\nwere what? Coconspirators in something? Setting the whole thing up with a bunch \r\nof lies about a sick friend in Baltimore. ",
        "Blake: I\u2019m sorry. ",
        "Ross: You must be very disappointed that you \r\ndidn't catch Tory and me romping naked in the living room. That would have made \r\nyour little scheme well worth it, wouldn't it? ",
        "Tory: Blake, you got to see for yourself that \r\nthat's not what's going on, that there's absolutely nothing going on between \r\nRoss and me. ",
        "Blake: You're wrong. I saw plenty. \r\n",
        "Ross: What exactly did you see that was in \r\nany way improper? ",
        "Tory: Did I do something wrong? ",
        "Blake: Well, you started to, by spilling \r\ncoffee down the front of your shirt. ",
        "Ross: She could have scalded herself. That \r\nwas an accident. ",
        "Blake: Was it an accident that you chose to \r\nwear the closest fitting garment this side of pantyhose? ",
        "Ross: Oh, for God's sake. ",
        "Tory: I tried to find the clothes that looked \r\nlike they were the least used. ",
        "Blake: Really? What were you trying to do \r\nwhen you picked a top the size of a band-aid? Show Ross how your little tummy \r\nsurvived the coffee unscathed? ",
        "Ross: That's exactly what she was trying to \r\ndo. Do you know how insulting this is to me? Do you trust me this little? \r\n",
        "Blake: Of course... I trust you, Ross. \r\n",
        "Tory: Yeah, she trusts you. It's me that she \r\ndoesn't trust. ",
        "Ross: This is ridiculous. ",
        "Blake: No, I don't trust her. ",

        "\r\nRick: Hey. ",
        "Claire: Hey. ",
        "Rick: Did you check in a Mr. Panghorn today?\r\n",
        "Claire: Just came from him. He's still very \r\nuncomfortable. ",
        "Rick: Well, then he's not ready for that \r\nphysical therapist yet, is he? ",
        "Claire: Agreed. You know it might be a good \r\nidea for you to go check on him yourself. He's very fond of you. ",
        "Mel: And then again, who isn't? ",
        "Rick: Hey. ",
        "Claire: Nice flowers. ",
        "Mel: Thank you. ",
        "Claire: A gift? ",
        "Mel: Yes, from a secret admirer-- \r\nunfortunately. But then again, it could be from one of hundreds of people.\r\n",
        "Claire: Doctor? ",
        "Rick: Yeah? ",
        "Claire: Is there something going on that I \r\nshould know about between you and Dr. Boudreaux? ",
        "Rick: Don't start with me, Claire. Don't even \r\nthink about starting with me. ",
        "Claire: Fine. I will go check on the biopsy \r\nresults for Mr. Barzoni. ",
        "Rick: Great. Why don't you do that? \r\n",
        "Claire: I'll go do that. ",
        "Nurse: Will this work? ",
        "Mel: Oh, that's perfect. ",
        "Rick: It's a great idea. ",
        "Mel: What? ",
        "Rick: You know, putting the flowers here so \r\neverybody can enjoy them. ",
        "Mel: Oh, I\u2019m not going to put them there. I \r\nhave a different idea. ",
        "Rick: Well, naturally. Far be it for us to \r\nagree on anything. I mean, if I said the sky was blue, you would say it was \r\ncloudy, right? ",
        "Mel: It is cloudy today. Could you put those \r\nin room 322, please? ",
        "Nurse: Ms. Bailey? ",
        "Mel: Well, maybe we can cheer her up a little \r\nbit. What? You think I should have left them there? ",
        "Rick: No. I\u2019m just... I\u2019m just very impressed \r\nthat you're not giving up on our toughest patient, that's all. ",
        "Mel: Now why would I do that, doctor? I\u2019m in \r\nit for the long haul. ",
        "Rick: You know, you're turning out to be \r\nquite the physician, doctor; complete with a wonderful bedside manner and a very \r\nhealthy perspective. ",
        "Mel: Rick, don't. ",
        "Rick: What? What? Feel free to compliment \r\nyou? ",

        "\r\nHarley: I happen to know all there is to know about Rick and Mel's friendship, \r\nthank you. ",
        "Gus: Oh, yeah, it's a friendship. ",
        "Harley: It is a friendship... ",
        "Gus: Right. ",
        "Harley: ...Because Rick is totally open and \r\nhonest with me. And if he said he was breaking things off with Mel, he was \r\nbreaking things off. ",
        "Gus: Didn't look like that to me. ",
        "Harley: I think it's time you go, okay?\r\n",
        "Gus: You just can't stand it when I\u2019m right \r\nabout something. ",
        "Harley: All right, what is your point? What \r\nare you saying to me? Are you saying that Rick and Mel had some big, hot and \r\nheavy thing that I\u2019m not aware of? Is that what you're saying? ",
        "Gus: You know what? You're a cop. Just think \r\nof the evidence. ",
        "Harley: What evidence? ",
        "Gus: Well, there was the kiss. ",
        "Harley: Uh-huh. ",
        "Gus: And there was the flowers. ",
        "Harley: He gave her flowers? ",
        "Gus: Oh, yeah. There was flowers. Flowers \r\nwere definitely involved. I was even there when she opened the card and it said, \r\n\"All of my love, Rick.\" Now, think about it, a guy doesn't send a woman a \r\nbeautiful, expensive bouquet of flowers when he wants to give her the boot, get \r\nrid of her. No, he gives he a beautiful, expensive bouquet of flowers when he is \r\nstill interested. Did I tell you about the card? \"All my love...\" ",
        "Harley: Would you shut up! ",
        "Gus: Right. \"All my love, Rick,\" is what he \r\nsaid. ",
        "Harley: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Gus: Okay. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. \r\nIt could happen. Rick and Mel used to be friends, and now they're not anymore, \r\nso the bouquet of flowers was actually an official peace offering. ",
        "Harley: See, that's what I think it was.\r\n",
        "Gus: Except there was that kiss. And that \r\nkiss was electric. ",
        "Harley: Electric, huh? ",
        "Gus: Oh, yeah, it was electric. You saw it.\r\n",
        "Harley: Mm-hmm, I saw it. I happened to get \r\nthere just in time. ",
        "Gus: Hell of a kiss. Yeah. Well, I know... I \r\nknow that you're hurting, you know. I have been there. Whew. ",
        "Harley: Really? ",
        "Gus: No. Yes. Yes. Do you see me with \r\nanybody? Do you? I know how this, you know, hits you. I know how it... Look, I \r\nknow that you wanted it to work out with Rick, and I am sorry. ",
        "Harley: Well, it's not... I\u2019m not angry. I\u2019m \r\nnot even really jealous. I mean, we don't feel that way about each other. I\u2019m \r\njust surprised. ",
        "Gus: Right. Well, you know what? Maybe \r\nactually it's better that this happened, you got to see it for yourself, and you \r\njust know how things are meant to be. ",
        "Harley: Great. ",
        "Gus: Don't worry about it. It's going to get \r\nbetter, don't worry. ",
        "Harley: Off. ",
        "Gus: Hmm? ",

        "Sam: No. No, Buzz, you shouldn't have done \r\nthat. I can't eat it. ",
        "Holly: You need more than half a bowl...\r\n",
        "Buzz: I\u2019m insulted. ",
        "Holly: ...Of minestrone in your stomach.\r\n",
        "Buzz: Half a bowl? I\u2019m insulted again. \r\n",
        "Sam: It's just that I\u2019m not hungry, you know? \r\nAnd besides, I've got to go back to work. ",
        "Holly: Forget it. ",
        "Sam: Holly... ",
        "Holly: I am the boss, and you cannot go, at \r\nleast for the rest of the day. You fell... Passed out on the floor, remember?\r\n",
        "Sam: Well, fine. Then I\u2019m just going to go \r\nwork on my own time. Hey. ",
        "Holly: That story that you want to get back \r\nto is the mob story, right? The one that so conveniently fell into your lap?\r\n",
        "Sam: It's big, Holly. It's going to be good.\r\n",
        "Buzz: Like your burger. Eat it. ",
        "Holly: Okay. All right. If this story is so \r\nphenomenal, tell me what you have so far? ",
        "Sam: So Buzz, what's in this exactly, thyme, \r\ntarragon, something like that? ",
        "Holly: Sam, don't make me pull rank. \r\n",
        "Sam: Okay. I went down to the warehouse \r\ndistrict. I was following up on a lead I got about the mob here in Springfield \r\nsupposedly moving on to legitimate business now. ",
        "Holly: And? ",
        "Sam: And when I have some more notes, I'll \r\nlet you know. Until then, you're safe. ",

        "Sam: Saved by the cell, huh? ",
        "Holly: This interview is not over. \r\n",
        "Buzz: The answer is oregano and thyme. In the \r\nburger. The question is how did you get this bump on your noggin, or am I going \r\nhave to give you another one to get the truth out of you? ",

        "\r\nRoss: Blake, what as Tory done to deserve this? How can you not trust her?\r\n",
        "Blake: Because I see things clearer than you \r\ndo, Ross? ",
        "Ross: From where, your vantage point outside \r\nthe window? You know, coming from you, this makes absolutely no sense. \r\n",
        "Blake: What do you mean from me? ",
        "Tory: Ross, please do not do this on my \r\naccount. ",
        "Ross: Who was it who said that Tory should be \r\nmy assistant? Who arranged it? Who hired her? ",
        "Blake: Me. ",
        "Ross: Yes. You said she would be the perfect \r\nperson to help me with my law practice, correct? ",
        "Blake: And I believed that. ",
        "Ross: And hasn't she done precisely that?\r\n",
        "Blake: Well, there's no argument on the work \r\npart. ",
        "Ross: All right. Then let's get to the \r\nnon-work part. ",
        "Blake: Ross, look at her. She's a young, \r\nsingle woman. She should be spending time with her law student friends, people \r\nher own age. ",
        "Ross: Yes, she should. I told her that myself \r\nseveral times. ",
        "Blake: And has she listened to you? No.\r\n",
        "Tory: I've gone out with Jeff. ",
        "Blake: Once. But you've been closeted with \r\nRoss a half a dozen times since then. ",

        "Ross: So Tory Granger is too good, too \r\ndedicated, that's what I\u2019m hearing. ",
        "Blake: She shouldn't be spending every \r\navailable moment with you. ",
        "Ross: Oh, for the love... ",
        "Tory: I spend every available moment on the \r\nlaw, Blake, because it is my entire life. ",
        "Blake: And Ross is not only your teacher, but \r\nhe is your boss, which means he is your whole life. Now, I can understand where \r\nhis passion would appeal to you or anybody else in your situation. But Tory, you \r\nneed to widen your scope. ",
        "Tory: So that's why you gave me this \r\nmakeover? ",
        "Blake: I thought it would be easier for you \r\nto meet guys your own age. ",
        "Tory: No. You did it because you want to keep \r\nme away from Ross. God, Blake, I thought that you were my friend. ",

        "Buzz: Look, I\u2019m not an oasis of reason in \r\nthis wacky world, but there's no way you're going to do a complete turnaround \r\nwith Marah in one fell swoop. I know you're trying to prove yourself after what \r\nhappened, but I mean, don't overdo it, not with the mob. You have to be very, \r\nvery, very careful. ",

        "Sam: Did you guys make a weekend out of it? \r\nWas it a weekend to remember, Buzz? ",
        "Buzz: Well, everybody that showed up made it \r\na weekend to remember. We ended up sharing the cabin with 4,000 people. Well, \r\nthere were four, actually. Plus kids. But, you know, I've got to say, being with \r\nHolly-- even in a crowd-- is 1,000% better than not being with her at all.\r\n",

And I can't believe how incredibly selfish \r\nthat was. ",
