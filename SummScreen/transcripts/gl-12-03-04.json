        "Olivia: Okay, that's enough. It's enough already. I'm a control freak. You know that.",
        "Bill: And that has to do with what?",
        "Olivia: You blindfolded me and led me to Lord knows where.",
        "Bill: But you're with me, honey bunny. Not good enough?",
        "Olivia: In the boardroom or bedroom? Come on. I'm not taking another step.",
        "Bill: Well, you're lucky then, because we're already here.",
        "Olivia: Where's here? The beach.",
        "Bill: Welcome to your honeymoon. (Laughs)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Frank, I'm not trying to be whatever it is you think I'm trying to be. Look, Phillip Spaulding is not just any murder victim. So if this Ruth Karloff person is your number one suspect, you're going to have to bring me something concrete to take into court. Yeah, well, it sounds like she wants to confess. I just want it to be that she... well, that I'm there when she... when she does. I'll call you back.",
        "Edmund: Why do I feel as if I've been given a homework assignment?",
        "Cassie: Making a baby? It could be worse.",
        "Edmund: I just never thought there'd be so many charts and graphs and...",
        "Cassie: Well, welcome to the world of fertility. Yeah, the fun part starts soon.",
        "Edmund: Really?",
        "Cassie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Edmund: Well, we don't need a graph for that.",
        "Cassie: I know this seems like a science lab, but if this works, Edmund... I mean if we do everything right and it works...",
        "Edmund: We're going to be parents.",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Wow. You don't look great. I wonder why?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tony: You're acting like I don't look so good.",
        "Michelle: Well, I'm a little worried about you, okay? You're sweating a lot. And I think you're dehydrated. Your electrolytes are really way off.",
        "Tony: (Breathing heavily) It's hot. It's hot.",
        "Michelle: Tony, you're like a volcano. Okay. Are you feeling any nausea?",
        "Tony: Only when I think about our situation. (Laughing)",
        "Michelle: Tony, I'm serious, okay? I'm being serious right now. I think that you were hallucinating before.",
        "Tony: I just had a bad dream. I had a bad dream.",
        "Michelle: Okay, Tony, listen to me. Listen to me, all right? I don't want to worry you, but you're really sick. Okay, and unless we find a way to get you out of here, it's only going to get worse.",
        "Tony: Okay, Michelle. Just take it easy, okay? I'm fine. I'm fine.",
        "Michelle: Tony, look, I know a serious fever when I see one. You're not fine.",
        "Tony: It's a jungle. It's a...",
        "Michelle: Yeah, and it's not that hot.",
        "Tony: Look, I'm fine, okay?",
        "Michelle: Mm-hmm. Yeah.",
        "Tony: See? Look. I'm fine",
        "Michelle: You're fine? You're fine, right? No worries here. Look, I'm just going into this store and I'll get you some aspirin. That'll make you feel better?",
        "Tony: Okay. Okay. You just grab me some water while you're out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Dinah, I'm not in the mood. So state your business and please just go.",
        "Dinah: Can't I express some concern for a dear friend? Hello, friend. You feeling sad, because someone stole your little blonde doll that you used to like so much?",
        "Jeffrey: You know, sometimes I'd wish you were a man because, I'd get to... you know, pow.",
        "Dinah: When has me being a woman ever stopped you from being rough?",
        "Jeffrey: Hi. Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt, but...",
        "Edmund: You did.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. I was just... I was concerned about Tammy. I was wondering if she made it home?",
        "Cassie: Yes. We saw her on Thanksgiving, but we haven't seen much of her since.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm sure that things are going to work out. Just, you know... I just saw you guys come in and you were so happy. I figured it had something to do with the kids.",
        "Edmund: Well, you're right, Mr. O'Neill. Our happiness has everything to do with a kid.",
        "Jeffrey: With a kid? Really?",
        "Edmund: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that's great.",
        "Cassie: We just had a preliminary visit with the fertility doctors. We don't want to get ahead ourselves, so...",
        "Jeffrey: Well, congratulations. That's... that's incredible.",
        "Edmund: Please excuse us, Mr. O'Neill. Our to-go order is about to leave. Cassie.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm happy for you.",
        "Cassie: Thanks.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Well, good night.",
        "Dinah: Can I get you a drink? I'll buy. All right, come on. What else you're going to do tonight, huh, pal?",
        "Jeffrey: Maybe... maybe just one.",
        "Cassie: You. You need to behave yourself.",
        "Edmund: Me? What did I do?",
        "Cassie: You were practically gloating before with Jeffrey.",
        "Edmund: Oh, Cassie, the doctor gave me specific orders to have unlimited sex with you. I'm supposed to gloat.",
        "Cassie: I don't think \"unlimited sex\" were the exact words that the doctor used.",
        "Edmund: Cassie. Cassie, sometimes in life you just have to read between the lines.",
        "Cassie: (Squeals)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Hey, there.",
        "Tammy: Thanks for that, Sandy. I needed to jump-start my heart.",
        "Sandy: Well, I figure a girl who hangs out at the docks at night doesn't frighten easily. You're making a regular stop of this, huh?",
        "Tammy: Don't worry, I'm not going in the water tonight.",
        "Sandy: Good thing, because you'd be on your own. The lake looks like it's freezing over.",
        "Tammy: It is getting cold.",
        "Sandy: Here. Better?",
        "Tammy: Thanks. What would I do without you?",
        "Sandy: That's a funny thing that you should ask. It's a possibility you may have to learn to live without me real soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: This is your idea of my ideal honeymoon spot? A beach with snow on it?",
        "Bill: Well, baby, anyone could come in the summertime. I mean, take a look around. We got this place to ourselves.",
        "Olivia: Well, go figure, Bill.",
        "Bill: What? What is wrong? Come on, this is the grand gesture that women are always saying they want from men.",
        "Olivia: It's freezing out here.",
        "Bill: Oh, come on, it's a little chilly. It's a little light dusting of snow. So what? We got cozy blankets, hot drinks, warm bodies. What's with the attitude?",
        "Olivia: I have... I have places to go and things to do.",
        "Bill: What do you got to do?",
        "Olivia: I have to... I know them. I have reading I have to do tonight.",
        "Bill: Okay, so wait a minute. Are you telling me that reading is more important than our honeymoon? Is that what you're...",
        "Olivia: No, I guess not.",
        "Bill: Then settle down, girl.",
        "Olivia: Well, you know, this actually my first real honeymoon.",
        "Bill: I did not know that.",
        "Olivia: In some ways it's really my first real marriage, too.",
        "Bill: You better not let your exes hear that.",
        "Olivia: No, what I mean is this only time I've ever known what I've gotten myself into. All the other times I thought I could... I had delusions of making things work, but then it would all come crashing down on me.",
        "Bill: What can you say? We're a testimony to the jailhouse wedding.",
        "Olivia: Yeah.",
        "Bill: (Laughs)",
        "Olivia: We do have fun, don't we?",
        "Bill: Who has more fun than us, huh?",
        "Olivia: Thanks for making me laugh.",
        "Bill: That is my pleasure. What's going on? Come on. You're drifting out of focus. You and me. Here and now. Tell me what is going on inside that pretty head of yours? And make it quick because I want to get cracking on the honeymoon before hypothermia sets in. Come on, what's going on?",
        "Olivia: I just... okay. Well... first of all, I just had a couple of hours of unbearable grilling with Chief Frank Cooper.",
        "Bill: That bad, huh?",
        "Olivia: Well, no one likes to be accused of murder.",
        "Bill: Well, honey, if it makes you feel any better, I'm sure we're all suspects.",
        "Olivia: No, no, Bill, he's going to hammer you about me.",
        "Bill: Will you just forget about that stuff for now, please?",
        "Olivia: I can't. I can't. Because you know what? I ran into Beth after I saw Frank, and she vowed that she would love to pull the switch when I'm sitting in the chair. And then Lizzie... Lizzie says she's going to raise... help raise Emma, you know, once I'm rotting in jail for shooting her father.",
        "Bill: Okay, wait a minute. You didn't shoot anyone. Okay, you did not shoot anyone. And they're going to figure that out. And no one...",
        "Olivia: No.",
        "Bill: No, listen to me. No one, I mean no one, is going to take Emma away from you.",
        "Olivia: Don't be so sure about that. I have been fighting with the Spaulding's over my daughter since the day she was born. And recent history has shown that the only way to stop them is to put a bullet in them.",
        "Bill: You're not... stop it. You're innocent. Lizzie, she's just trying to push your buttons. That's what she does. Now, look, I know you had a hard day. I know that. That's why I took you here. I mean, don't you remember you said you want a honeymoon on the beach? Well...",
        "Olivia: Look, I know what you're trying to do, and I wish I could tell you how much this means to me.",
        "Bill: Listen to me. I am just as worried about all this stuff as you are. I am. But truth is on our side. We didn't kill Phillip.",
        "Olivia: What are our options?",
        "Bill: We have to stick it out. Like I said, truth will prevail. Besides, if you run, it's only going to make you look guilty. (Phone rings)",
        "Olivia: Hi, it's Olivia.",
        "Nanny: Ms. Spencer, I'm at the airport with Emma.",
        "Olivia: That's good.",
        "Nanny: The flight for San Cristobal leaves soon. Are you on your way?",
        "Nanny: Ms. Spencer, will you be making the flight?",
        "Olivia: Yes. That's good. That's good. I'll meet you later. That was Jane. That was Emma's nanny.",
        "Bill: Is everything okay?",
        "Olivia: Yeah, she's just worried about me.",
        "Bill: Why?",
        "Olivia: Because I'm so stressed out about all this stuff. I think a swat team is going to swoop down and arrest me any minute.",
        "Bill: Hey, just tell me what do I have to do to make you forget about all this stuff, just for a minute?",
        "Olivia: I love that you want to make me happy.",
        "Bill: You know, my Daddy once told me, he said if your wife is happy, your life is happy. And you know me, I always listen to my Daddy, don't I? I always do. See there. Now there's a smile. That's it. Now are you going to have some fun on your honeymoon?",
        "Olivia: I think it's wonderful and I think... I'm so grateful. And I love you. I love what you're doing for me.",
        "Bill: Hey, hey, hey, come on. It's one night. Tell me what it's going to take to make you forget about this stuff? Some caressing? A kiss? And some sweet talk? Mon cheri. Mi amour. Let poppy take care of you.",
        "Olivia: (Laughs)",
        "Bill: Do I have to do a dance for you? Do I do this? Don't hold back. Hold yourself. There it is.",
        "Olivia: You know, if we spend the night here...",
        "Bill: Come on.",
        "Olivia: Then we're going to wake up to an arrest warrant probably.",
        "Bill: Here it is.",
        "Olivia: Stop that! (Laughs)",
        "Bill: Tell me you don't want some of this. Tell me you don't want some of this. Come on.",
        "Olivia: You could sell ice to an Eskimo.",
        "Bill: Speaking of Eskimos, you know, to have sex in the snow is a very natural thing. There it is, right there. I think I got you right there. In fact, I'm going to get us some hot drinks, that's what I'm going to do. Okay?",
        "Olivia: Listen, I have to tell you something.",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Olivia: You know what? Maybe... maybe this is better that we don't talk. Okay? Stop it. Don't look at me like that.",
        "Bill: Will you stop it? Do not look at me like that.",
        "Olivia: Just shut up and kiss me like you mean it.",
        "Bill: I can do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: As much as it pains me, I think I owe you an apology.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, really?",
        "Dinah: Mm-hmm. Cassie and Edmund, they're floating on a cloud. She's trying to get pregnant. You know, she's forming her life with Edmund.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, thank you so much for your concern, but I'm fine.",
        "Dinah: You know, this case of self-denial that you're going through, I mean, I'm a bit concerned because I think it's dangerous for you to have all these emotions bottled up inside of you the way you do.",
        "Jeffrey: Like I said, I'm fine, Cassie's fine, we're all fine. Except maybe you.",
        "Dinah: You know I'm trying to help you. I wrote the manual on unrequited love.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, you also wrote the one on self-obsession, as I recall. Right? Anything else?",
        "Dinah: Sure. Yeah. I think it is amazing when I see Cassie parade around here --and I'm not going to mention this again--the way she paraded around here with the baby news. It was like she just wanted to see you suffer. Have you told her how much you care about her? At all?",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie doesn't know how I feel, and neither do you.",
        "Dinah: Don't be so sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: What's up? I thought you'd decided to stick it out in Springfield.",
        "Sandy: I'm not going anywhere. You are.",
        "Tammy: Excuse me?",
        "Sandy: It's time to leave the nest, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: You're kicking me out of the apartment.",
        "Sandy: Oh, that's a distinct possibility. I don't think it's a good situation for either of us.",
        "Tammy: Well, thanks a lot. So, you followed me all the way to the docks just to tell me that you're evicting me?",
        "Sandy: Well, I was going to tell you at home, but I saw your car here.",
        "Tammy: I can't believe you're kicking me out.",
        "Sandy: Did I say that? Maybe I did. What I meant was, Tammy that we're going to have to make some big changes if you want to stay on at my apartment. Starting with the sleeping situation. I'm sick of the couch. And don't look at me like that. I think we could do a weekly trade-off. You get the bed for a week, and then you can try the couch.",
        "Tammy: Fine. Are we done?",
        "Sandy: Not quite.",
        "Tammy: Look, I know I should be paying rent. I just applied for a job on campus. I should be hearing back...",
        "Sandy: No, no, it's not about the rent. I don't need any rent money right now, but I do think there are other things you can do to earn your keep.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Here. Here. Come here. I want you to drink this. Come on. Come on.",
        "Tony: Where'd you get that?",
        "Michelle: I got it from the spring. Where do you think, huh? You better drink it before you start bursting into flames, there. Come here. Come here. Tony? Listen to me. You've got to stay with me, all right? Tony, I want you to wake. I want you to talk to me.",
        "Tony: (Mumbling) About what?",
        "Michelle: Tony, I want you to talk to me. Talk to me, I don't know, talk to me about politics. Talk to me about football. You like football, right? Come on, Tony.",
        "Tony: I like football. I was... I was really good at football...",
        "Michelle: Can you talk to me. Huh? Come on, you've got to stay with me, Tony. You've got to stay with me.",
        "Tony: Okay.",
        "Michelle: What? What?",
        "Tony: (Whispering) This is all your fault.",
        "Michelle: Okay, it's all my fault, that's fine. If that'll keep you awake, it's all my fault. Come on, Tony. You've really got to try to stay with me. You've got to stay awake. Can you stay awake?",
        "Tony: Michelle? (Gasping) Michelle. Michelle, you're... you're...",
        "Michelle: I'm still here. You had me scared there for a minute.",
        "Tony: You look... you look different.",
        "Michelle: Me? What about you? You look like you got run over by a truck and tossed off a cliff.",
        "Tony: I did fall.",
        "Michelle: That would explain it, then. You do look a lot better and that'll make this easier.",
        "Tony: Make what easier? Huh?",
        "Michelle: Saying goodbye. I'm leaving.",
        "Tony: No! No! Don't go. Don't go. (Gasping)",
        "Michelle: Hey, hey. Leaving? Where would I go? I'm not leaving you, okay? I'm right here.",
        "Tony: Don't go. Please. (Shivering) Just stay please.",
        "Michelle: You know, telling me what to do never worked for Danny, so I don't know why you think it's going to work for you.",
        "Tony: Where'd you get the clothes?",
        "Michelle: You know, I really feel bad about this, but I wouldn't leave you if I didn't think you could take care of yourself. I mean, you feel ten times better.",
        "Tony: No, start from the beginning. When did you... when did you...",
        "Michelle: The beginning? I guess that's what it's all about, isn't it? The beginning.",
        "Tony: You and me, right?",
        "Michelle: Mm-hmm. The explosion, that was our beginning.",
        "Tony: Right, you and me. Explosion, yeah.",
        "Michelle: See, my beginning goes back much further, to the Bauers and the family that Danny and I were trying to make.",
        "Tony: You got your memory back.",
        "Michelle: Yeah. Lucky me. You knew it had to come back someday, right? Let's see, in the meantime we fooled ourselves into thinking that the past doesn't really matter as long as we have each other.",
        "Tony: No, no, no. That's not the way I saw it. What you and I have right now is what's important to me, Michelle.",
        "Michelle: I'm not downplaying what we had.",
        "Tony: No, you mean, \"what we have.\"",
        "Michelle: Tony, it's not real. This is the real me. And everyone knows that I have to be this way.",
        "Tony: It's not for me.",
        "Michelle: We can still be friends, can't we?",
        "Tony: No, no, no! Michelle, no! Don't go! Please.",
        "Michelle: Tony. Tony, Tony, Tony, I'm still here, okay? Look, I'm right here.",
        "Tony: Stay. Stay. Don't leave me.",
        "Michelle: I'm not leaving you.",
        "Tony: (Gasping) Michelle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: You know, I just wish I could make this whole investigation disappear. But I can't. But I think maybe I can help you forget about it for a while.",
        "Olivia: You already have. This is all really nice.",
        "Bill: I was going for amazing.",
        "Olivia: (Laughs)",
        "Bill: So, I don't know... I'll tell you what. Don't worry about being cold. I think I got an extra blanket in the car, so I'll go get it, okay? I'll be right back.",
        "Olivia: Hey, Jane. It's me. Is Emma asleep? Good. I'm hung up. Is the flight on time or is it delayed? Right. Uh, no. Just wait there and I'll... just don't do anything until you hear from me, okay?",
        "Bill: Hey. Is that... is that Jane again?",
        "Olivia: Yeah, Emma was crying. She woke up, but she went back down.",
        "Bill: I got an extra blanket. Maybe it's time we start warming things up.",
        "Olivia: Bill?",
        "Bill: What?",
        "Olivia: I just want you to know that...",
        "Bill: I know. I know. You're scared. It feels like everyone wants to pin this murder on you. I know that. But look, we started this fight against Phillip together, you hear me? And that's how it's going to stay. You and me together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: (Laughs)",
        "Edmund: I always wanted to do that. And then I thought, you know, I better not wait too much longer.",
        "Cassie: Hey! (Laughter)",
        "Edmund: All right. Let me see. If I remember correctly from the pamphlets, we need to take your temperature every day. You need to take a prenatal vitamin and I apparently have to take a whole lot of zinc. And I think I'm also going to be calling a personal chef.",
        "Cassie: You don't have to do that.",
        "Edmund: I do, because you have to watch your diet.",
        "Cassie: It's not like I'm in training or something. We're just getting started on this journey. We're at the very beginning and I think we should let nature take its course.",
        "Edmund: Ooh.",
        "Cassie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Edmund: What? What's wrong?",
        "Cassie: Well, if we really want to get pregnant, now is not a good time. Matter of fact, it's the worst time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Are you looking for a little adult pay-per-view? I thought maybe you'd like the real thing.",
        "Jeffrey: Do we really have to do this?",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Jeffrey: You know, the sparring, the mind games. It's been a long day, Dinah. I really, really just want to be left alone.",
        "Dinah: Not me.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I can't help you, there.",
        "Dinah: Well, I think you can. Yeah. Because something tells me deep down, being alone would make you more miserable than you already are. So, why don't we do something about that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: \"Other things\" I can do to earn my keep? Funny, I just offered those things and you turned me down.",
        "Sandy: Get over yourself, there, hot stuff. I'm talking about a different kind of help. Since I'm sticking around, I thought I would do some home improvement, and I want to build some shelves for my sound equipment.",
        "Tammy: What sound equipment?",
        "Sandy: The stuff I'm going to buy, since I'm sticking around. And I want to get my head back into construction so I can convince Josh and Billy to hire me back at Lewis construction.",
        "Tammy: Seriously? Because they're pretty mad at you right now.",
        "Sandy: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know they are, but I think I can win them over. Eventually. Right now, though, I need an assistant. You ever work a circular saw?",
        "Tammy: I don't think I'll be very helpful. I know nothing about carpentry.",
        "Sandy: Right. You're not exactly the handy type. That must come from living in a palace when you were little. There's got to be something you can do to contribute.",
        "Tammy: Well, I could cook for you if you had any dishes.",
        "Sandy: Wait. You cook?",
        "Tammy: I'm a good cook.",
        "Sandy: What is your specialty?",
        "Tammy: Roast chicken and mashed potatoes.",
        "Sandy: Mm.",
        "Tammy: And French toast. Macaroni and cheese. Oh, you're hungry. (Laughs)",
        "Sandy: Yes, yes, yes. I have a plan and a half. The hardware store is open for about another half hour. Why don't you come with me and get your cooking stuff, I'll get my hardware stuff.",
        "Tammy: And what? I cook dinner for you tonight?",
        "Sandy: Why not?",
        "Tammy: Why not? You know, I have been thinking I needed to do something for you. I just never thought of something as simple as cooking.",
        "Sandy: Tammy, the best things in life are simple. Come on. Let's make like eggs and scramble, huh? Hey, I can smell that chicken roasting. The last person to the car washes the dishes. Come on. I'm so beating you!",

        "Dinah: You know, I just... everybody needs someone, Jeffrey. And you're all I have.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you're a free woman now, Dinah. Okay? Whatever you do with your life doesn't have to involve me anymore.",
        "Dinah: Well, you know, it's just... you understand me, Jeffrey. I mean, like nobody else does. You understand me. I think people think I don't have feelings, but I do. And I didn't want to be obvious before. I didn't want to say that we are two miserable people who can share in that pain and enjoy ourselves for a night. And I didn't want to ask you, are you ever tired of coming up short in your life and never really getting what you want?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you know what? Thank you so much for sharing. I guess we've both made a habit out of watching other people get the things that we want in life, hmm? A little love, a little happiness, a little trust.",
        "Dinah: So, why don't we just focus on what we need, okay? And what we like.",
        "Jeffrey: What we both know that we like.",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Why don't you sink yourself into me? Lose yourself into me and be sweet and kind and wonderful, and just free yourself from everything else.",

        "Cassie: We need to consider conserving our resources.",
        "Edmund: Excuse me?",
        "Cassie: Well, more like your resources.",
        "Edmund: My resources?",
        "Cassie: Not that you have a limited amount of resources.",
        "Edmund: You're right, I don't.",
        "Cassie: It's just that we need to apply the most resources when they're going to do the most good, and right now they're not going to do much good.",
        "Edmund: All right, then. When do you think they'll do much good?",
        "Cassie: (Sighs) um... (clears throat) right there, in that week.",
        "Edmund: That long?",
        "Cassie: Mm-hmm. So, until such time that we're able to get to that little window.",

        "Cassie: We can't... we can't... we cannot cave on the first day. We can't do that.",

        "Edmund: Right. Well, waiting is good.",
        "Cassie: Sure.",
        "Edmund: I mean, I'm not saying the idea of dropping whatever I'm doing at a moment's notice and taking you wherever you happen to be isn't appealing.",
        "Cassie: No, you're not saying that at all.",
        "Edmund: No, and there's a lot to be said for build, for anticipation, for letting the moment swell.",
        "Cassie: A lot.",
        "Edmund: So, we wait. It'll be that much better.",
        "Cassie: You bet. So, if we're not, you know, supposed to cave for a few days.",

Oh, my God. Tony. Tony, I know what's wrong with you, okay? You got bitten. You got bitten by that spider. Okay, Tony, I don't know how much time we have, all right? I just... I don't know. I don't know. So I need you to listen to me. Listen to me. You've got to stay awake, okay? You've got to try to stay awake!",
