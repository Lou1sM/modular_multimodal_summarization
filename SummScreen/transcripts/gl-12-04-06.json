        "Josh: I understand, Reva. I understand what you did.",
        "Reva: I've been hoping to someday hear you say that.",
        "Josh: I still wish you would have told me. I still think it was wrong.",
        "Reva: I know.",
        "Josh: But I realize that it was your sacrifice that let me build that hospital. And they gave me a medal, but it was your sacrifice.",
        "Reva: You want to know a secret?",
        "Josh: ( Laughs ) Okay. Bring it on.",
        "Reva: That day on the Intrepid, when they were honoring you, I was so proud. I was watching from below, but I felt like I was right there with you sharing the whole moment, the way it was supposed to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Remy: We're in a parked car. I look good, I smell good, I have Leah's Usher C.D. in the glove department.",
        "Tammy: Very romantic.",
        "Remy: And you're thinking about Johnny boy and Lizzie taking off with the baby.",
        "Tammy: Says who?",
        "Remy: Anyone who's paying attention.",
        "Tammy: I'm right here with you, Remy, okay?",
        "Remy: Good. Because I'll help you if you want.",
        "Tammy: I don't want. Even if I did, that wouldn't be fair to you.",
        "Remy: Honestly, I'd rather have him around so I can take him on in person and prove to you I'm the better guy. Just say the word, Tammy, and I'll drag his scruffy ass back to town.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: You are a squirrelly little thing, yes, you are. Do you know the last time I did this, I think it was with Emma when I kidnapped... I'll explain that to you when you're older. Oh, you want me to hold you? Come here. Come here. Okay, I know I'm not a great mom yet, but I will be soon. Yes, I will. Same with your daddy. Did you know that right now your daddy is out buying you... oh, a stroller! Yes, he is. Look, I know that we left in a big hurry, okay? But we are going to make you the best home wherever we are, I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: I am so glad you could join me, Doris. I did take the liberty of ordering you something.",
        "Doris: Oh, I hope not too much. I did have a big lunch.",
        "Alan: They make a delicious grilled octopus salad. And I also got a bottle of Chateau D'yquem, 2001 for us.",
        "Doris: Mm, sounds expensive.",
        "Alan: Of course. You know, I've wanted to meet you socially for some time now.",
        "Doris: Delicious. You want me to ask a judge to grant you custody of Jonathan and Lizzie's baby.",
        "Alan: And if you could read my mind, you'd know that I want it done today before Jonathan and Reva can stop it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I'm so sorry that I hurt you, Joshua.",
        "Josh: And I'm sorry that you had to go through what you went through on your own.",
        "Reva: I wasn't. I had Billy and I had Jonathan, and you were there with me whether you knew it or not.",
        "Josh: So the past is past?",
        "Reva: I think the hardest day was when you gave me Cross Creek. It was my first day of chemo, and I was so sick, but you did this amazing thing for me, and it would have been so easy for me to fall into your arms and just take comfort there.",
        "Cassie: Hey.",
        "Josh: Hey.",
        "Cassie: Hi. You kind of took off. So I'm interrupting something.",
        "Reva: Josh got me away from the hospital. It's kind of hard being there.",
        "Cassie: Oh yeah, that makes since, after what you went through, I don't think I would want to spend anymore time there than I had to either. So what did I miss?",
        "Reva: We were just talking about H.B.'s hospital and how proud I am of what you two accomplished.",
        "Cassie: You know what? What Josh told Alan about your sacrifice, he was right.",
        "Reva: Okay, enough butt- kissing. We have bigger things to have to take care of.",
        "Cassie: Jonathan and Lizzie?",
        "Reva: Yes. I want to get to them before Alan does.",
        "Josh: I think that's a good idea.",
        "Reva: It's just, you know, them being gone is a good thing. I mean, if they stay away a little while longer, maybe Alan will back off.",
        "Tammy: It's not going to be just a little while. I think Jonathan and Lizzie are gone for good.",
        "Cassie: Did you hear from them?",
        "Tammy: Jonathan left me a voicemail saying good-bye.",
        "Reva: Good-bye?",
        "Josh: Jonathan doesn't usually run away from a fight. In fact, he usually picks them.",
        "Tammy: He has a wife and a kid now. Maybe it's better this way, you know? He and Lizzie can have a life for themselves and the baby without Alan and...",
        "Reva: I'm going to see if I can reach them.",
        "Josh: Can we drop you somewhere?",
        "Reva: No, no, I'll take a taxi.",
        "Cassie: Reva, don't be silly. We'll take you...",
        "Reva: No, really. Thanks, both of you. I'll talk to you later.",
        "Josh: If you need help with Alan, let me know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Another glass?",
        "Doris: No, I have to get back to work. All right, maybe a little. It is very good wine.",
        "Alan: And you have very good taste.",
        "Doris: Mm. I can hardly get used to it on a D.A.'s salary.",
        "Alan: Well, that's a shame. I guess we'll have to do this more often when my family life settles down a bit.",
        "Doris: Does that happen?",
        "Alan: Pardon me?",
        "Doris: Your family life. Does it ever settle down, I know mine doesn't.",
        "Alan: Well, I suppose not. I guess we have a lot in common.",
        "Doris: We do?",
        "Alan: Yes. We care very much for our families, and we will crush anyone who tries to hurt them.",
        "Doris: And we both hate Jonathan Randall.",
        "Alan: You see.",
        "Doris: You know, I've lost a lot of cases, but letting Jonathan Randall slip through my fingers after what he did to my daughter...",
        "Ashlee: What are you doing?",
        "Doris: Mm, Ashlee, sweetheart.",
        "Ashlee: Don't \"sweetheart\" me! You guys are plotting against Jonathan Randall, and you both should be ashamed.",
        "Doris: Jonathan has run off with Lizzie and her baby.",
        "Ashlee: I wonder why.",
        "Doris: Ashlee, don't be rude.",
        "Ashlee: Look, you don't know Jonathan like I do. He's not dangerous; he's just misunderstood.",
        "Alan: Join the club.",
        "Ashlee: Don't make jokes. Jonathan is the best. I only wish it was my baby he'd fathered.",
        "Alan: You and me both.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: You are the cutest baby in the entire world. Yes, you are. Okay so I know that it's good that you're sleeping, but I kind of wish that you could wake up and talk to me. I can't wait until we get to hang out. We're going to get to do so much stuff together. We're going to go shopping. These, by the way, are excellent. Mm-hmm. Oh, my God, pretty soon you're going to have your first cookie. I am going to be such a pushover parent, just like my dad was with me. Your daddy, on the other hand, is going to be the tough one, make sure you don't eat too much sugar. He just wants to do everything perfect. It's sweet, isn't it? He's so into this whole dad thing. Let me tell you, it was not easy getting him there. ( Telephone rings ) Who's that? Hey. Yeah, we're fine. Did you find a stroller? I don't know. The most expensive one has got to be the best, right? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Lots of diapers and pampers and wipes. I think that's it. You should see her little face right now. She's sleeping-- I'm looking right at her. No, I am not bothering her. She looks kind of like you, actually. You get that deep little crease in your brow when you're sleeping really hard. Yes, you do, and so does she. It's really cute. That was your daddy, little one. Yes, it was. And he loves you so much. I just hope that he can love me someday. I think he can. I have a lot of great qualities, as long as it's just the three of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: You heard Alan-Michael. He said he wanted them hunted down like animals. You're better than this.",
        "Jeffrey: It's just a job, O'Neill. It's just a job.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Hey Reva, it's Lizzie.",
        "Reva: Lizzie, where are you?",
        "Lizzie: I can't say, just in case they are recording. Are you alone?",
        "Reva: Yes, I just walked in the door. How's the baby? How are you? Did you take the baby to the specialist yet?",
        "Lizzie: The baby is fine. We're all fine. You don't have to worry.",
        "Reva: Okay, but let me tell you something, your granddad is on the warpath. He's determined to find you guys.",
        "Lizzie: Well, let him. Jonathan is smarter. He's hidden us really well.",
        "Reva: I'm sure he has.",
        "Lizzie: He's being so sweet and gentle with the baby. He's out buying stuff for her right now. He'll be back soon.",
        "Reva: I want to talk to him.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, I will have him call you as soon as he gets... um, no, actually, it probably won't be today. We don't want these calls to be traced.",
        "Reva: Lizzie, how long are you guys going to stay away? Because it just... are you okay? I mean, are you and Jonathan okay?",
        "Lizzie: We're good. We're getting closer. Being on the run does that, I guess.",
        "Reva: It's just that the longer you're gone, the angrier Alan's getting.",
        "Lizzie: We're not going to let him scare us, Reva. As soon as my granddad stops threatening to take the baby, well, then maybe we'll think about coming back.",
        "Reva: I'll see if I can get him to cool his jets.",
        "Lizzie: Thanks. Sorry we took the baby away from you.",
        "Reva: I'll see her soon. Right now I just want to make sure that you're safe and sound. Do you guys need anything? You need any money?",
        "Lizzie: We have each other, and that is more than enough.",
        "Reva: Give that little angel a kiss for me and make sure Jonathan calls me.",
        "Lizzie: Will do.",
        "Reva: Does she have a name yet?",
        "Lizzie: No, not yet. I've really got to go. Bye, Reva. ( Knock on the door ) Daddy is home! Daddy is home! Yay!",
        "Jeffrey: Hello, Lizzie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: So were you on a date with Remy?",
        "Tammy: Kind of. He offered to track down Jonathan for me.",
        "Josh: He did?",
        "Tammy: Said it would be better to have him here. I told him no.",
        "Cassie: You did?",
        "Tammy: It wouldn't be fair. I mean, Jonathan's my past. Remy could be...",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan and Lizzie are doing what they have to do to keep their baby safe.",
        "Cassie: Well, I just hope they're not going to make it worse because Alan is...",
        "Tammy: I know. I saw him.",
        "Josh: You know, Tammy, this is really not your problem.",
        "Cassie: It really isn't. It isn't at all, and especially if you're moving on.",
        "Tammy: I'm trying to.",
        "Cassie: But it's hard, I know.",
        "Tammy: I thought I could face anything when the baby was born, but the thought of never seeing Jonathan again...",
        "Cassie: I know it's scary and painful, but, honey, you will get through this. You will fall in love again.",
        "Josh: It takes time. It takes a lot of time to get over your first love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ashlee: Oh, excuse me. May I have a glass?",
        "Doris: No, don't do that, please, Ashlee. She'll be leaving. We were just in the middle of a very important business meeting.",
        "Ashlee: Yeah, right. You get your nails and hair done for a business meeting.",
        "Doris: Good-bye, Ashlee.",
        "Ashlee: Look, Jonathan is my friend.",
        "Doris: It's just a schoolgirl crush on a bad boy.",
        "Ashlee: You should talk! Look, Jonathan is one of the good guys. You just haven't given him a chance.",
        "Alan: Ashlee, I admire your loyalty. You know Jonathan, though, as being wild and free, not as someone who should be changing diapers. I'm doing him a favor. And I hope that you help him see that one day.",
        "Ashlee: Really? You do?",
        "Alan: Yes. And I think you could have a lot of influence on him when I bring him home.",
        "Ashlee: Okay, okay, so sit down, drink his wine and help him out.It's good to see you, Mr. Spaulding. And tell her you like her dress. She loves that.",
        "Alan: I'll do that.",
        "Doris: You are amazing. I can't even get her to make her bed.",
        "Alan: That's what maids are for. I told you how important family is to me, and that's why Lizzie and her baby should be home with Beth and me.",
        "Doris: Your wife is a lucky lady. I hope she appreciates you.",
        "Alan: Huh. Well, I appreciate you securing this custody hearing very much.",
        "Doris: I'll do what I can. Jonathan and Lizzie are still in hiding, though.",
        "Alan: Not for long. I've sent someone out to find them, someone who is even more desperate than I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Beth!",
        "Beth: Hi, Reva. Hey, can I come in? I don't want anybody to see me here.",
        "Reva: Sure. By anybody, are you talking about Alan?",
        "Beth: He'll think I'm stabbing him in the back.",
        "Reva: Well, you know what? That's fine by me. In fact, I've got a big old knife in the kitchen. ( Laughter )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Robert Newman and Jordan Clark, \"Inside The Light.\" Jordan and I, I think we sort of bonded from the very beginning. I think that our brother-brother relationship off camera and on camera really started practically from the first day that we started working together. We just... I guess we just have several things in common, and we work in a very similar way. I remember sitting in a car with Robert Newman, and we were kind of recounting something. And he was sighing like \"I'm this way,\" and I'm sighing like \"I'm that way,\" and it happened, and I thought, \"I don't have any brothers, but this guy could definitely be my brother.\" See Josh and Billy, Wednesday, December 6, \"Inside The Light.\"",

        "Cassie: Hot chocolate.",
        "Tammy: I remember when this used to fix everything.",
        "Cassie: What? You think you're too old?",
        "Tammy: I'll try anything. I think I'll go get some cookies, too. You want some?",
        "Josh: No thank you, darling.",
        "Cassie: Hey, see if they have sugar cookies, will you?",
        "Tammy: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: Okay, what?",
        "Josh: What do you think?",
        "Cassie: Well, I just think that I'm sad for my daughter.",
        "Josh: I mean, what do you think about Jonathan leaving?",
        "Cassie: I think he's married to someone else, and she needs to get a grip and try to find someone who has a little less drama in his life.",
        "Josh: Less drama is a good thing.",
        "Cassie: Yes, it is.",
        "Josh: I'm kind of going for less drama with Reva these days.",
        "Cassie: Well, that was something, the way you defended her to Alan.",
        "Josh: I'm just saying that I'm trying to get past the anger, trying to get past why she did what she did.",
        "Cassie: Well, I think that's a good thing. I'm glad. Because, I mean, if it hadn't been for Reva, we never would have fallen in love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Thank you.",
        "Reva: You're welcome. So you've finally come to your senses.",
        "Beth: I think you have the wrong idea.",
        "Reva: Oh, so you're not here to sidestep your husband?",
        "Beth: No.",
        "Reva: You know something, Beth, you used to be the sweetest girl.",
        "Beth: Oh, come on, Reva. We're not all that different. I just want what is best for my daughter. You can appreciate that.",
        "Reva: Not when it hurts my son.",
        "Beth: I'm not out to hurt Jonathan.",
        "Reva: No?",
        "Beth: Okay, I admit, I have never wanted him in Lizzie's life, but she does.",
        "Reva: You've noticed that, too, huh?",
        "Beth: Yeah. And I've been there.",
        "Reva: Lujack.",
        "Beth: Yeah. Alex says Jonathan reminds her of Lujack. But that's neither here nor there. They need to bring that baby home.",
        "Reva: I don't think that's going to happen.",
        "Beth: Have you talked to them?",
        "Reva: Yeah, Lizzie. I just talked to her a few minutes ago.",
        "Beth: She called you?",
        "Reva: Yeah. She didn't call you?",
        "Beth: Well, I'm sure she will when she's ready. What did she say? When are they coming back?",
        "Reva: Not until Alan calls off his dogs.",
        "Beth: Well, Alan has hired his own wolf. Her name is Doris. That's what I came here to tell you.",
        "Reva: Oh, great, and what is she going to do?",
        "Beth: She's going to argue that Lizzie and Jonathan forfeited their parental rights when they didn't get that baby the medical attention she needed.",
        "Reva: That's ridiculous!",
        "Beth: Did they take her to a doctor?",
        "Reva: You're with Alan?",
        "Beth: Reva, you have to admit that they're behaving irresponsibly, and as long as Lizzie is with Jonathan, that baby will never have a stable home.",
        "Reva: And she will with Alan?",
        "Beth: I'll be there too.",
        "Reva: That's supposed to be a consolation?",
        "Beth: Okay, neither one of us is perfect, but we can ensure that Lizzie becomes a good mother.",
        "Reva: And what about Jonathan?",
        "Beth: Jonathan had to know what he was risking when he took his wife and daughter away, and the longer he stays on the run, the worse it's going to be. Somebody could get hurt.",
        "Reva: Somebody. You mean Jonathan?",
        "Beth: Reva, talk to him. He will listen to you. Tell him to bring Lizzie and that baby home before something bad happens.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Well, Doris, I believe this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.",
        "Doris: I'm counting on it. You know, using Jeffrey O'Neill to find Lizzie and Jonathan has its risks.",
        "Alan: Why do you say that? He's unprincipled, ruthless, and hard up for cash. That's why I hired him.",
        "Doris: Yeah, I know, but that's not what makes him dangerous. It's his conscience. Once in a blue moon he has one.",
        "Alan: Miss Peralta? Eavesdropping?",
        "Ava: I'm meeting your son here for a lunch, a working lunch.",
        "Alan: Do you mind if I join you until he arrives?",
        "Ava: It's a free country, Alan.",
        "Alan: More for some than others.",
        "Ava: I guess you know what it's like to usually get your way, right?",
        "Alan: It goes with the territory.",
        "Ava: Oh, territory. So have you had any luck tracking down Jonathan and Lizzie?",
        "Alan: Not yet, but I'm working on it. I have the feeling you didn't like me hiring your father for the job.",
        "Ava: Mr. O'Neill. He's basically a stranger to me, and I'm fine with that now that I know what he's about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Let me guess: You were just in the neighborhood.",
        "Jeffrey: Your grandfather's worried about you, Lizzie. You left in such a hurry that you didn't even say good-bye.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, that must have slipped my mind.",
        "Jeffrey: There's no problem, you know. He just wants to make sure that everything is ok.",
        "Lizzie: If you do anything, I will scream at the top of my lungs.",
        "Jeffrey: I... listen, I'm just here to make sure that you have everything you need.",
        "Lizzie: I know that my granddad sent you here to take us back.",
        "Jeffrey: I wouldn't do that.",
        "Lizzie: Really? Then get out.",
        "Jeffrey: Come on, Lizzie. Where's the famous Spaulding hospitality?",
        "Lizzie: Jonathan is going to be back here any second. If he walks in and finds you here, he's going to kick your...",
        "Jeffrey: Whoa, whoa, language, Lizzie. I happen to know that Jonathan is busy right now. He's dealing with a flat tire.",
        "Lizzie: Why can't you guys just leave us alone? ( Baby crying ) Great, look what you did.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, do something.",
        "Lizzie: It's okay. What am I supposed to do? I'm just figuring it out.",
        "Jeffrey: I don't know, but please do something. I mean, I don't know a lot about babies, but maybe she's hungry. Aren't you supposed to feed her right about now.",
        "Lizzie: Yes, I am supposed to feed her, but I need to go get her a bottle. Shh.",
        "Jeffrey: You don't have food here?",
        "Lizzie: Not in the room. Wait... I just need to... it's right down the hall.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, go. Hurry, go, go.",
        "Lizzie: It's okay. Shh.",
        "Jeffrey: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.",
        "Lizzie: Wait? She's screaming.",
        "Jeffrey: Leave the baby.",
        "Lizzie: What?",
        "Jeffrey: Leave the baby.",
        "Lizzie: I am not going to leaving my baby with you.",
        "Jeffrey: What am I going to do with a screaming baby? ( Baby crying )",
        "Lizzie: Fine, take her. There you go.",
        "Jeffrey: Wait, wait... Lizzie. ( Baby continues fussing )",

        "Reva: Excuse me, is this where they're holding the Randall custody hearing?",
        "Man: Yes, but the proceedings are closed to the public.",
        "Reva: Well, I'm not public. I'm family. You want to make something out of it? Yeah.",
        "Mel: Reva, are you all right?",
        "Reva: Yeah, um... we need to talk about the strategy we want to use to take on Alan.",
        "Mel: Are you sure you're up for this?",
        "Reva: Yes. It was just a little dizzy spell.",
        "Mel: Reva...",
        "Reva: No, Mel, stop being a doctor. Today you're a lawyer.",
        "Mel: Fine. So you're here fighting injustice all by yourself?",
        "Reva: Yep, all by my lonesome.",
        "Mel: Really? Okay, let's call in for reinforcements. What's Josh's number?",
        "Reva: No, no Josh and Cassie. They've got their hands full with Tammy. Jonathan and that baby are my flesh and blood. This is my battle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Why did you leave me here with this kid? Because I ask you to. Lizzie! ( Baby crying ) Okay, well, don't stare at me. I don't have any food. Okay, come on. Hush, little baby don't say a word papa's going to buy you a mockingbird. And if that mockingbird don't sing papa's going to buy you a diamond ring and if that diamond ring don't shine... there we go. Yeah. No one can resist the O'Neill charm. Works every time. Yeah. You know, you're not so bad when you stop complaining. A lot of women could learn a few lessons from you. ( sighs ) I have a daughter too, you know, but I never knew her. ( Sighs ) Not that I wanted to, because, you know, I've got enough to worry about. It's okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Christmas list. Coop, Frank, Buzz, Harley, Gus, Jude, Zach... Olivia... Jeffrey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: She doesn't need anything else. You're going to spoil her.",
        "Alan: Nonsense. I may buy her the entire store.",
        "Lizzie: You're incorrigible and the best great granddad she could ever ask for. Thank you so much for being so good to me and my little angel. Take us home? Take us home? Take us home?",
        "Beth: Alan?",
        "Alan: Any... any news?",
        "Beth: Nothing.",
        "Alan: You know, Beth, this is not the way it is supposed to be-- for you, for me, for Lizzie. This is supposed to be a happy time for all of us.",
        "Beth: I know. I thought that we could keep her safe. I thought that you... Alan, let's just go home. Come on, there's nothing more that you can do here.",
        "Alan: No, you go ahead. The house is starting to feel like a prison cell to me, and I cannot rest until Elizabeth and that baby are back home. Go ahead. I've got some work to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Okay.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, it took you long enough.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, did it kill you just to hold her for a couple of minutes?",
        "Jeffrey: Be careful. Yeah, it practically did.",
        "Lizzie: What happened to you? Look what I have.",
        "Jeffrey: Nothing happened to me, okay? I'm doing my job.",
        "Lizzie: So your job is separating a baby from it's parents?",
        "Jeffrey: Look, I told you. It's not that.",
        "Lizzie: Just save it. You can take us back. We're just going to leave again. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Jeffrey: O'Neill.",
        "Alan: I need some good news. Tell me that you found Elizabeth and the baby. Listen, I pay you very well, and I expect results. Have you tracked them down or not?",
        "Jeffrey: Uh, well, you know... you know what, Alan? I think my tracking skills have kind of gone from me. Uh, I had them, but then I lost them. Yeah, the trail has gone cold, so it's a lost cause.",
        "Alan: I'll show you what a lost cause is. If you don't bring Elizabeth and that baby home, your career in Springfield is over. Do you understand me, Mr. O'Neill?",
        "Lizzie: Why didn't you tell him?",
        "Jeffrey: Look, you don't want to go back, besides, how was I going to get you and that baby through the lobby without you getting me arrested first?",
        "Lizzie: I'm pretty sure you would have thought of a way. What? What was it? What changed your mind?",
        "Jeffrey: It doesn't matter. You know, you should learn from this, okay? You've got to be smarter. If I can find you, anybody can find you. You've got to change it up a little. Change your look; change the baby's look. Stay out of five-star hotels. It's too... it's too you.",
        "Lizzie: She got to you.",
        "Jeffrey: She didn't... look, take her to a doctor too, please, for a checkup, okay? We don't want anyone thinking you're a bad mother or anything.",
        "Lizzie: Jeffrey?",
        "Jeffrey: No, no... ( sighs )",
        "Lizzie: Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Thank you for being here, Beth.",
        "Beth: You don't have to thank me, Alan. We both want the same thing, for Lizzie and that baby to be home.",
        "Alan: I thought this was supposed to be a closed hearing.",
        "Beth: Alan... Alan, maybe this is a good thing.",
        "Alan: How is that?",
        "Beth: When the judge rules in our favor, no one can say that we cheated.",
        "Alan: I'm not looking for approval. I want results.",
        "Doris: Alan, you've got the moral high ground here. Let's keep it, okay? Let me do your fighting for you.",
        "Alan: That's what Jeffrey O'Neill told me, but he still hasn't brought back Lizzie and that baby.",
        "Doris: Yeah, well, I tried to warn you. Jeffrey O'Neill's a loser. I'm not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Look at those two. They look like two cobras in the same basket. Alan needs to hear from me.",
        "Mel: Wait, wait, don't turn this into a street fight, okay? At least not until your backup arrives.",
        "Reva: My what?",
        "Mel: You can fire me if you want, but I called Josh.",
        "Josh: Hi there.",
        "Reva: You really didn't have to do this.",
        "Josh: Reva, you don't have to fight battles on your own, okay? And besides, I really can't stand the idea of Alan singing \"Rock-A-Bye, Baby\" to Jonathan's child.",
        "Reva: Thanks, Bud.",
        "Josh: Well, actually, you should thank Tammy, because she's the one who put aside her own issues and insisted we be here.",
        "Cassie: I think we should find a seat. The hearing is going to begin any minute.",
        "Tammy: You know, I wanted to be here. This is the same place I gave up Jonathan so he could be a parent with Lizzie.",
        "Cassie: Sometimes you have to give up the thing you love the most.",
        "Tammy: Sometimes.",
        "( Phone rings )",
        "Remy: Hey, you okay?",
        "Tammy: Does your offer to find Jonathan still stand?",
        "Remy: Yeah, I'm on it.",
        "( Reva, Mel and Josh speaking in hushed tones )",
        "Josh: I appreciate the phone call, thank you.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Harley: All right, there's only one thing we can do about this Bailey Brook.",
        "Gus: Do you have her address?",
        "Ava: Hey, guys. Let me guess: Family happy hour.",
        "Doris: I'm sorry to say but their absence here today really only goes to prove that they are incapable of caring for their child, which brings us to this man here."
