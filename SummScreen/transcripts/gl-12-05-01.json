        "Danny: Well, here we are. ",
        "Michelle: Yep. ",
        "Danny: D\u00e9ja vu, huh? Us, this place, millions \r\nof dollars of stolen money. Except last time it was bearer bonds. So, who's \r\nready for a barbecue? ",
        "Michelle: (Laughs weakly) you know, the \r\nmemories in this place aren't all bad. ",
        "Danny: No? ",
        "Michelle: Remember when we were rescuing \r\nReva? The night we spent out in the hot tub, under the stars? (Whispers) (\r\nlaughs) ",
        "Danny: How could I forget? (Laughs) \r\n",
        "Michelle: There's going to be some stars out \r\ntonight, I bet. ",
        "Danny: Well, Mrs. Santos, it is a very good \r\nthing our son is not present to hear you talk like that. ",
        "Michelle: Well, if he were, I wouldn't.\r\n",
        "Danny: Uh-huh. ",
        "Michelle: I Miss him. ",
        "Danny: Yeah, me, too. When we said good-bye \r\nto him and told him that we'd be back soon, I just... I was praying that it was \r\ntrue. ",
        "Michelle: Thank God we have Meta to look \r\nafter him, you know? ",
        "Danny: Well, Carmen volunteered. Man, if that \r\nis not a testament to her insanity, I don't know what is. That she would think \r\nthat we would trust her with our son for even a second is-- unbelievable. \r\n",
        "Michelle: I have a suggestion... ",
        "Danny: Outrageous. What? ",
        "Michelle: Here we are, you know, alone in \r\nthis gorgeous house in a tropical paradise. ",
        "Danny: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Michelle: You know, we can't do anything \r\nabout Mr. Big or Carmen or the money until the bank opens in the morning, right?\r\n",
        "Danny: No, unfortunately, no. ",
        "Michelle: So, we could do something... Well, \r\nwe could actually sit here and feel miserable is what we could do. Or... or we \r\ncould concentrate on something more positive. Something that makes us feel good. \r\nAnd happy. And fulfilled. ",
        "Danny: Like what? ",
        "Michelle: Guess. ",

        "\r\nCarmen: Danny and Michelle should be in San Cristobel by now. Here's the plan.\r\n",
        "Gus: Oh, do tell. ",
        "Carmen: Okay, tomorrow, they go down to the \r\nbank over there, posing as Spaulding employees. They withdraw $25 million in \r\nnegotiable securities, using the access codes they stole. Then... ",
        "Gus: Right, then they come back with the \r\nmoney and they give it to a fictitious Mr. Big. ",
        "Carmen: Right. So, that's the best time for \r\nyou to nail them: Once they reenter the country. ",
        "Gus: Best time to nail them, says you. \r\n",
        "Carmen: What are you talking about? You're \r\nsure to catch them red- handed, under your jurisdiction. ",
        "Gus: Maybe. ",
        "Carmen: I'll monitor their movements, and \r\nthen I'll tell you when it's good for you to move in on them. ",
        "Gus: Oh, you're going to monitor their \r\nmovements? You're going to tell me? (Sighs) ",
        "Carmen: I have connections on that island.\r\n",
        "Gus: Hey, sweetheart, I've got connections, \r\ntoo, okay? I've got connections all over the world. Don't forget, I'm the one \r\nthat holds your immunity in my hands, okay? ",
        "Carmen: You know, these threats are getting \r\nso tiresome... ",
        "Gus: They're not threats, Carmen, they're not \r\nthreats. They're not. Just let's not forget I'm the one that calls the shots.\r\n",
        "Carmen: You were. ",

        "\r\nOlivia: A toast. ",
        "Josh: Yes, ma'am. ",
        "Olivia: Hey, in less than an hour, Lewis \r\nConstruction will officially become a publicly held corporation and the three of \r\nus will become very, very rich. Thanks to my handsome, brilliant... ",
        "Josh: Yeah, talk it up... ",
        "Olivia: ...Sexy... ",
        "Josh: Keep talking... ",
        "Olivia: ...Husband. ",
        "Josh: Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. \r\n",
        "Olivia: (Laughs) ",
        "Josh: Now, it's not that I didn't appreciate \r\nthose compliments, but I do have to say this. A beautiful woman has been pushing \r\nme along the whole way. ",
        "Billy: Just don't push him too hard. \r\n",
        "Olivia: No, no such thing as being pushed too \r\nhard. The sky's the limit, right? ",
        "Josh: That's right. ",
        "Olivia: No more obstacles, no more misgivings \r\nor doubts. ",
        "Josh: Everything is crystal clear now. \r\n",
        "Olivia: No more interference from the likes \r\nof Alan Spaulding. ",
        "Billy: Or Reva. Now, admit it, you'd kind of \r\nlike to have Reva here so you could rub her nose in the victory and say, \"I told \r\nyou so.\" ",
        "Olivia: No, Billy, I don't want that at all. \r\nAnd she's got her own problems. She's fighting her own demons. And it's a \r\nwonder, but my heart goes out to her. ",
        "",
        "\r\nConstance: Why aren't you minding the children? ",
        "Reva: The children are having their riding \r\nlesson. My services weren't required at the moment. ",
        "Constance: So, you took this opportunity to \r\nfill your head with more nonsense. What book are you reading this time? This \r\nbook was banned in our Parish! How did this get into my house? ",
        "Reva: Oh, I... I don't know. I found it \r\nhidden... ",
        "Constance: Do you know what this is about?\r\n",
        "Reva: Well, I have a pretty good idea. It's a \r\nlot like \"Madame Bovary,\" only the heroine in this one is... ",
        "Constance: She's not a heroine, she's a \r\nharlot! This is lewd, immoral filth! A word to the wise, Miss Shayne, keep \r\nbringing books like this into my home and spouting your outlandish views on \r\nsociety and progress, and people will take serious issue with your sanity.\r\n",
        "John: Oh, I doubt that, ma'am. If anyone has \r\nher wits about her, it's Miss Shayne. ",
        "Constance: How gallant of you to defend a \r\nfellow servant, John. But if Miss Shayne truly had her wits about her, she'd \r\nknow better than to cross me. ",
        "",
        "\r\nCassie: You want to see your baby? ",
        "Camille: Well, you said he's all right?\r\n",
        "Alonzo: He's better than all right. He's \r\nmaking an amazing recovery. ",
        "Camille: It's because you were there for him, \r\nAlonzo, when he needed you. You nearly died so that our little boy could live. I \r\nwould have been right there with you, too, if I had known. ",
        "Cassie: I didn't purposely exclude you, \r\nCamille. ",
        "Camille: I know, I know that. ",
        "Cassie: When we adopted Will, I wanted you to \r\nbe a part of his life and you wanted to cut all ties. ",
        "Camille: Well, I went home to my parents' \r\nplace in Iowa. If you had phoned there, how would I have explained that to them?\r\n",
        "Cassie: I'm sure we could have worked \r\nsomething out, but you didn't want to. ",
        "Camille: Because at the time I thought the \r\nbest thing to do was to make a clean cut. But then yesterday, a girlfriend from \r\nSan Cristobel called and she said, \"Did you hear that the president's son, his \r\nlittle boy, is really sick?\" All of a sudden, I got this giant lump in my \r\nthroat, and then I heard that you had surgery, too, and I couldn't stay away. I \r\njust couldn't. So, can I please see my little boy? Please, can I just see him?\r\n",
        "Cassie: Of course, you can see Will, if that \r\nwill make you feel better. ",
        "Camille: When? Now? ",
        "Cassie: I have to call the doctor first, and \r\nmake sure it's okay for him to have visitors. ",
        "Camille: Oh, well, make sure you tell them \r\nit's very important. You know, I came all this way. ",
        "Alonzo: Camille. If they don't let you see \r\nhim, it's not personal. It's just because Will's been through a lot and he needs \r\nsome rest and a lot of quiet right now. ",
        "Cassie: That's right, and if you're allowed \r\nto see him, you'll have to keep it short. ",
        "Camille: Anything. I just want to see my \r\nlittle boy. ",
        "Cassie: I'm going to go out in the hallway \r\nand make the phone calls, so... I'll give you two privacy. ",
        "Alonzo: Thanks. ",
        "Camille: Mrs. Winslow's not exactly thrilled \r\nthat I'm here, is she? ",
        "Alonzo: I think she's just surprised, that's \r\nall, and more than a little curious. But then again, so am I. ",
        "Camille: Curious about? ",
        "Alonzo: Oh, come on, Camille. You walked away \r\nfrom me. You walked away from our baby, and you did it all without even a second \r\nthought. Now all of a sudden, you show up here with all this motherly concern. \r\nWhat's going on? ",

        "\r\nConstance: Are you a doctor, John? Or a clergyman? ",
        "John: Hardly, ma'am. ",
        "Constance: No, you're only a gamekeeper. And \r\ntherefore in no position to judge how dangerous Miss Shayne's radical ideas \r\nmight be to young, impressionable minds. ",
        "John: Aye, ma'am. My apologies. I'm a common, \r\nunschooled man, without the refinement of your Ladyship. I take my pleasure in \r\nthe simple things, in the natural world the Lord created. And my, did I see a \r\nsight this morn. A fat red fox scooted across the north meadow so fast, his coat \r\nlooked like a streak of fire in the sun. And I saw the exact spot where he went \r\ninto the ground as well. ",
        "Constance: Oh, you saw his den? ",
        "John: Aye, ma'am. ",
        "Constance: You must tell the huntsmen \r\nimmediately, so they'll know where to send the hounds on Sunday. ",
        "John: Aye, ma'am, I can do that. Or I can \r\nshow you m'self, and you can tell the huntsmen. That is, if your ladyship \r\nwouldn't mind taking a stroll with me in the meadow, just the two of us? \r\n",
        "Constance: Now? I'm not properly dressed.\r\n",
        "John: I'll wait right here, ma'am, if you'd \r\nlike to put on something more comfortable. ",
        "Constance: Very well. I shan't be long.\r\n",
        "Reva: You should be careful, John. The fox \r\nisn't the only thing Lady Constance wants to catch. ",
        "John: The same goes for you, Miss Shayne. \r\nYou're on her bad side now. That's a right dangerous place to be. ",
        "Reva: I can handle her. ",
        "John: Oh, I have no doubt. But just the same.\r\n",
        "Reva: You're... I know what you're doing. You \r\nthink that if you can distract Lady Constance, that she'll forget about me. But \r\nthat's a dangerous game, too, John. Especially if Sir Arthur gets wind of it.\r\n",
        "John: Perhaps so, ma'am, but it's worth the \r\nrisk. You are worth the risk, ma'am. There's that strange feeling again. What do \r\nyou call it? ",
        "Reva: D\u00e9ja vu? ",
        "John: Aye, aye. Miss Shayne, Miss Shayne, \r\nI'll gladly endure a walk in the woods with her Ladyship, if it will keep you \r\nhere and keep you safe. But make no mistake, when I'm walking with her, I'll be \r\nthinking of you. ",

        "Olivia: If I should be rubbing this in \r\nanybody's face, it's yours, Billy Lewis. Because you were against the harbor \r\nproject from the beginning. ",

        "Josh: New York? ",
        "Olivia: No, it's something else. It's the \r\nMason from the lighthouse. You know what, maybe I should deal with this face to \r\nface, and then when I get back, we'll continue our celebration, okay? \r\n",

I got to tell you, there's nothing I would like more \r\nthan to go find Alan right now and beat the daylights out of him, but I'm not \r\ngoing to do that. Not going to do it because I know that that would tip him off \r\nto the... To the setup. So I'm going to wait, be patient and hit him where it \r\nhurts.

        "Gus: Hmm, just put him in prison for life \r\ninstead. ",
        "Carmen: Yes, well, that's worse for Danny, \r\nprison. Now Carlos and I have worked this out to the very last detail. Nothing \r\ncan backfire unless you screw up. So please don\u2019t. ",

        "Dax: Well, whatever Camille's reason for \r\nbeing here, she poses no threat to you or Richard. Legally she gave up all \r\nrights to the child. ",
        "Cassie: Oh, Dax, I feel like such a \r\nhypocrite, you know? I practically forced Alonzo to be a part of Will's life. \r\nNow, that Camille wants the same thing, I\u2019m like freaking out. Is that because I \r\njust... I'm jealous that she's his biological mother? Am I just being overly \r\nprotective? ",

        "Reva: No, now, stop that. No more dire talk. \r\nAll you two did was trust your hearts and that's nothing to be ashamed of.\r\n",
        "Rupert: But I\u2019m a gentleman and Tabitha's \r\njust the daughter... ",
        "Reva: So what? So what? Love knows no class \r\nor race or religion. It's universal and timeless, and there's no denying it. \r\nBecause if it happens, it can't be stopped. ",
