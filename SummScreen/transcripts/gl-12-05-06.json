        "Woman: Pretty. Is she your wife?",
        "Gus: No.",
        "Woman: Your girlfriend?",
        "Gus: I don't know her. I never saw her before in my life.",
        "Woman: Excuse me. You don't have to get to huffy about it.",
        "Harley: Yeah, what he said. That will teach her.",
        "Gus: I don't know her. I don't know her. I don't know any of these people.",
        "Harley: Are you sure she doesn't look at all familiar to you? You have no idea what secret this is that Blake has on the two of you?",
        "Gus: The two of us? There is no two of us.",
        "Harley: Well, now, think about it. Maybe you were so drunk, and it was so many years ago...",
        "Gus: I don't care how drunk I was. You wouldn't forget a face like that.",
        "Harley: Ha!",
        "Gus: You know what I'm saying.",
        "Harley: All right. There is only one thing we can do about this Bailey Brook.",
        "Gus: Absolutely. I know. As soon as I get an address, I'm going to go follow it up. I don't care if she lives in...",
        "Harley: Porterville. 585 Chicago Avenue, Porterville. It's like 20 minutes away.",
        "Gus: You have her address. You didn't tell me?",
        "Harley: Before I found out if there was anything between the two of you? How stupid do I look?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Hi.",
        "Olivia: What are you doing here?",
        "Jeffrey: Drinking.",
        "Olivia: Okay, well take your drink and... you need to go. Just go, just go. Leave.",
        "Jeffrey: Olivia, you know, I'm sorry for what happened all those years ago. I've apologized. I'm going to do everything I can to make it up to you. But after a long, lousy day, if I need a drink and we found ourselves in the same place, I'm not going anywhere, okay? That's where I draw in the line.",
        "Olivia: Look, I just want you to leave. I'll explain everything later. I want to talk to you later. Can you just go out that way?",
        "Ava: Hey, guys. Let me guess: Family happy hour?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Hey.",
        "Remy: Hey.",
        "Marina: Hm. Now I'm interested.",
        "Remy: It's nothing important. Ok, it's important, but it's too personal.",
        "Marina: Too personal to tell your roomie?",
        "Remy: It's just a little thing that I'm doing for our other roomie.",
        "Marina: Oh, well. If it has anything to do with Jonathan, I beg you to stop right now.",
        "Remy: I've got to do what I've got to do.",
        "Marina: Oh. You are hopeless.",
        "Remy: No. No, I'll know when it's hopeless. I'll take a shot at being Tammy's hero. Maybe it will work out for me in the long run.",
        "Marina: Remy, Remy, Remy. Tammy doesn't want a hero. She wants Jonathan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Hey.",
        "Josh: Hey. Where did Tammy go?",
        "Cassie: She decided not to stay. Is everything all right with Reva?",
        "Josh: Well, we'll see, I guess.",
        "Alan: Reva.",
        "Reva: Yes?",
        "Alan: You're wasting your time. Go home.",
        "Reva: You want to know where you can go, Alan?",
        "Alan: You know that Jonathan and Elizabeth aren't capable of being parents. That little baby should be with Beth and me.",
        "Reva: Living in the hall of doom? I don't think so. You really want to do something for that baby, Alan, you back off and leave those kids alone, and let them raise their...",
        "Josh: Okay, okay, okay. Just walk away, Reva. Good-bye, Alan.",
        "Reva: Good-bye, Alan.",
        "Josh: Come on, come on, come on. He's baiting you. You know that.",
        "Reva: Yeah. Well, I'd like to hit him, just once.",
        "Josh: Okay, that's fine-- after the trial.",
        "Bailiff: All rise. This court will come to order, honorable Judge Packard residing.",
        "Judge: You may sit. Well, we've all been here before, haven't we? I see that Elizabeth Spaulding's baby has been born, a girl, congratulations. So, Ms. Boudreau, where are your clients, Elizabeth and Jonathan Randall?",
        "Mel: They're not here, your Honor.",
        "Judge: Not here?",
        "Mel: We were not given sufficient notice of these hearings by Mr. Spaulding or Ms. Wolfee.",
        "Doris: That's not true.",
        "Judge: Where are they?",
        "Mel: They're out of town.",
        "Judge: You couldn't get them back? This is rather important, don't you think?",
        "Doris: It is extremely important, your Honor. But unfortunately, the Randall's are very young and very irresponsible, which is what the state's petition is all about. I'm sorry to say, but their absence here today really only goes to prove that they are incapable of caring for their child, which brings this man into the picture.",
        "Reva: Go get 'em, Mel. Tear 'em down.",
        "Mel: As I said, your Honor, Ms. Wolfe scheduled the hearings knowing full well that Jonathan and Lizzie were not going to be back in time.",
        "Doris: Ask her where her clients are right now?",
        "Mel: That's irrelevant.",
        "Doris: What's relevant is that you don't know. Nobody knows.",
        "Mel: We haven't had time to prepare, your Honor, so we ask that the court reschedule these hearings for at least two weeks from now.",
        "Alan: Two weeks! This is an emergency.",
        "Judge: Mr. Spaulding...",
        "Alan: I'm sorry, your Honor, but the safety of that newborn is at stake. Two days could make a difference. Two weeks is out of the question.",
        "Reva: That's ridiculous. The baby is fine.",
        "Alan: How do you know, Reva? Have you seen the baby?",
        "Judge: Mr. Spaulding, do you think the child is at that much risk?",
        "Alan: Yes, I do, Sam-- your Honor.",
        "Mel: Your honor, to proceed now would deny my clients due process.",
        "Judge: The safety of this child is the only thing that any of us should care about.",
        "Josh: We need to get Jonathan and Lizzie here.",
        "Reva: I don't know where they are. I talked to Lizzie, but she wouldn't say.",
        "Cassie: Well, let me try.",
        "Reva: Well, what can you do?",
        "Cassie: I don't know. But you need to stay here, so I'll get them here somehow.",
        "Josh: Thank you.",
        "Reva: Thanks.",
        "Mel: I doubt we'd even be here if Mr. Spaulding wasn't a prominent member of...",
        "Judge: I said noted, Ms. Boudreau.",
        "Doris: The people believe that Jonathan Randall and Elizabeth Randall have shown a pattern of irresponsible behavior-- behavior that threatens the safety and welfare of their child. Mrs. Randall gave birth to her baby in the front seat of a car in the middle of a blizzard. Mr. Randall delivered the baby himself. They were out joy riding in a snowstorm, when they should have been...",
        "Reva: Excuse me. They were not joy riding, your Honor. They were trying to make their way to the hospital, and you know it.",
        "Judge: Excuse me, but who are you? I mean, I know who you are, Mrs. Lewis. I've seen you on TV. But what is your relationship to this case?",
        "Reva: I'm Jonathan Randall's mother. And I was with him and Lizzie when she went into labor. They weren't joy riding. They were trying to make their way to the hospital. They got stuck in the snow, and another car slid into them. But no one was hurt. All I'm saying is that they were on their way to the hospital. They were trying to do the right thing.",
        "Doris: If they were so eager to do the right thing, then why did they leave the hospital with an ill child, Mrs. Lewis? Mr. Randall's newborn has a heart murmur. Now, the hospital staff encouraged them to stay at the hospital, to see a specialist immediately, but they ignored that advice. They took the baby, checked out of the hospital, and fled, without telling anybody where they were going. Now, is this responsible parenting? I don't think so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Hey, I think after we eat dinner here, we should go over... there's a new club on the other side of town and they play live music.",
        "Sheila: Sounds good.",
        "Billy: Did anybody tell you how easygoing you are?",
        "Sheila: Maybe it's because you come with good ideas. ( Laughter )",
        "Cassie: Billy, I'm glad I ran into you. I need your help.",
        "Billy: Oh, why is that? Oh, wait, wait, wait. Sheila, Cassie. Cassie, Sheila.",
        "Cassie: I'm sorry. I don't mean to be rude, but this is an emergency. Alan has wrangled up a hearing to try to get custody of Jonathan and Lizzie's baby. It's not going well, we don't know where they are, Reva's there, she needs...",
        "Billy: Wait, wait, wait. I'm kind of busy. I think Reva is going to have to rely on somebody else.",
        "Cassie: But, Billy, this is important.",
        "Billy: You're helping her. Josh is probably helping her, too, right?",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Billy: Then I think you've got all the help you need.",
        "Cassie: Fine.",
        "Sheila: Billy.",
        "Billy: ( Sighs ) You're lucky my date is so understanding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, I've got to go.",
        "Ava: Heading off to do some more dirty work for Alan Spaulding? Tracking down Lizzie and Jonathan wasn't enough for you.",
        "Jeffrey: It was just a job.",
        "Olivia: What was that?",
        "Ava: Well, Lizzie and Jonathan took off with their baby, to keep her away from Alan and Alan hired Jeffrey to track them down. It is so funny to me. The guy goes from acting mayor to complete sleaze ball in a matter of a few days. But then again, maybe he was always a sleaze ball.",
        "Olivia: Well, I mean he is your father, biologically speaking, anyway. You should really form your own opinions about him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Do you want one muffin or two?",
        "Gus: Um... you know what? Make it two.",
        "Harley: I'll make it bran. I don't want you to look bloated for your big mystery date.",
        "Gus: Yeah, I don't... she's not my mystery date. She's Blake's mystery date, if she's anybody's.",
        "Harley: That's what I said.",
        "Gus: You're not honestly worried about her, are you? Honestly, after all the crap I put up with with your exes.",
        "Harley: Why you got to bring them up?",
        "Gus: You've got to worry about my romantic past...",
        "Harley: \"Romantic,\" see?",
        "Gus: I don't... I don't know her, okay?",
        "Harley: Do you want to check out this stupid lead or not?",
        "Gus: Fine. Wait a second. How do I look? Kidding, I have a sense of humor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: Ms. Boudreau, this file says your clients fled the hospital with a child who may have a heart defect.",
        "Mel: They didn't flee anywhere, your Honor. They chose to leave the hospital with their child. A heart murmur is a fairly common condition in newborns and it isn't really that serious. I have a witness who'll testify to that if you'll allow it.",
        "Doris: Excuse me, I was not apprised of any of this.",
        "Judge: I'm sorry, Miss Wolfe. You opened this door.",
        "Mel: Thank you, your Honor. We call Dr. Rick Bauer.",
        "Rick: So a heart murmur in a newborn frequently resolves itself. Anyway, Jonathan and Lizzie wanted to seek treatment",
        "Mel: Thank you, Dr. Bauer.",
        "Judge: Ms. Wolfe, do you have any questions for Dr. Bauer?",
        "Doris: No. Thank you, your Honor. Trust me.",
        "Beth: What?",
        "Alan: Your Honor, forgive me for speaking out of turn, but I think there's something very important that the court should know, something I haven't even shared with my attorney here. Since we're gathering facts and the truth, I think this is so important for everyone to know, no matter how painful it may be.",
        "Reva: Here we go.",
        "Josh: What the hell is he up to now?",
        "Reva: I have no idea.",
        "Judge: Go ahead, Mr. Spaulding. Let's hear what you have to say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: So tell me, do you really think that the good guy always wins out in the end?",
        "Remy: That's what I'm counting on. At best, I win the girl. Worst-case scenario, I'm a heck of a guy who knows how to help a friend.",
        "Marina: You're so selfless.",
        "Remy: Aren't you the girl who sent Danny Santos back to his wife and kid?",
        "Marina: Yeah.",
        "Remy: Are you sorry you did that?",
        "Marina: No, no, not at all, but it was a totally different situation. I mean, you, my friend, are sitting on a landmine.",
        "Remy: Jonathan's married. Tammy's a free woman.",
        "Marina: Yeah, but there are about a billion other girls out there that would die to be with you. Why are you twisting yourself up in a pretzel for her?",
        "Remy: Because I think I have a shot. I think Tammy is just about done with Jonathan, and she'll be ready to give the good guy a chance. I won't walk away until I have to.",
        "Marina: Would you at least set yourself up with, like, a time limit?",
        "Remy: I'll know when, if... if the time comes and I have to say good-bye to Tammy, that's it. But until then, I'm in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Yes. Thank you very, very much.",
        "Cassie: Jonathan's voicemail box is full.",
        "Billy: Well, it's a good thing that we got his password from Tammy.",
        "Cassie: What? You got into his records?",
        "Billy: I did. He made his last three calls this morning from Indianapolis. So I think it's reasonable to assume that he and Lizzie and the baby are still there.",
        "Cassie: That is incredible, Billy. Thank you.",
        "Billy: Now, if we had time we could send a P.I. there, but we...",
        "Cassie: We don't.",
        "Billy: No. So maybe we could put a big sign up saying \"Jonathan, phone home\"?",
        "Cassie: That's an... you know what? We might be able to do something close to that.",
        "Billy: Good. Well, look, I wish you all luck, okay?",
        "Cassie: Wait, wait, wait. You're taking off just like that?",
        "Billy: I have somebody waiting for me back at Towers.",
        "Cassie: Who you said was understanding.",
        "Billy: Yes, she's understanding because I said I'd be right back and I don't want to disappoint her.",
        "Cassie: Uh huh.",
        "Billy: I like Jonathan; he's my partner. I'm really glad I could help.",
        "Cassie: And Reva?",
        "Billy: That's not my role anymore.",
        "Cassie: No. So your role now is running away from your feelings for Reva as fast as you can?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rich: Excuse me? Jeffrey O'Neill?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah.",
        "Rich: Rich Cosner. I'm the new manager here. I understand you're a singer/ songwriter. You have a band? You played some gigs around town?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, we used to. That was a while ago.",
        "Rich: When I'm not working here, I book talent over at Teal, the new club across town. I would really like to book your band this Friday or Saturday, if you're available.",
        "Jeffrey: Really? Well, I don't know if we can get the guys together.",
        "Rich: Tell you what, call me. I really want you headlining the club, Jeff. You'd be perfect for the place.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, have you heard us play?",
        "Rich: No.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, then how would you know if we would be perfect for the place?",
        "Rich: With your rep,\"Mayor goes bad\". People love a good scandal, they'll be lining up around the block.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: I was surprised you wanted to see me.",
        "Olivia: Me, too.",
        "Ava: Great.",
        "Olivia: I'm kidding. I'm kidding. No, I've actually been thinking a lot about us.",
        "Ava: Us?",
        "Olivia: Well, we're never going to be close.",
        "Ava: Are you sure about that?",
        "Olivia: Yep. But you love Coop, I love Buzz, which means...",
        "Ava: Proximity.",
        "Olivia: Proximity. Look, I want to be happy. I want Buzz to see me happy, which means we need to learn to co-exist.",
        "Ava: Which means?",
        "Olivia: We make an arrangement.",
        "Ava: An arrangement?",
        "Olivia: Yeah, yeah, an arrangement. You know, I give you medical history. We keep our distance, we're cordial. If there's tension in the room, one of us will leave. We'll just... we'll take turns. How's that?",
        "Ava: Sounds reasonable enough to me.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, like a business transaction.",
        "Ava: Do you want me to draw up a contract?",
        "Olivia: It doesn't need to come to that.",
        "Ava: Speaking of medical records, there is something that I would like: My birth certificate. My mom, Connie said that it was lost. Now I know why.",
        "Olivia: As a matter of fact, I happen to have it with me. I've been carrying it around since I went down to San Cristobel.",
        "Ava: Oh, thanks.",
        "Olivia: What's wrong?",
        "Ava: Uh... my birthday. I thought my birthday was one day, and it's three days earlier.",
        "Olivia: Maybe Connie and Greg felt that the day that they brought you home was your birthday.",
        "Ava: Yeah, wow, this is really weird. I've celebrated my birthday my entire life on the same day, and now it's not... it's... well, I guess it's only a day, right?",
        "Olivia: So... so are we good?",
        "Ava: There's kind of one more thing I would like. I'd like to spend a little bit more time with Emma.",
        "Olivia: Emma is four. This is really too complicated a situation for her to understand right now.",
        "Ava: Okay, well, it doesn't have to be complicated. We have a bond and she likes me. I don't think it's that big of a deal.",
        "Olivia: We are discussing this way too soon. Maybe down the road.",
        "Ava: Right.",
        "Olivia: This... she's my child, Ava. This isn't your decision; it's mine.",
        "Ava: I know that she's your child, and I know that you just came to me about an arrangement with Buzz. I know that you want him to see you in the right light. So, I don't know, maybe you'd reconsider.",
        "Olivia: Hmm, but what I find interesting is this: Everyone sees you as so sweet, not a manipulative bone in your body. I think you're more like me than you want to admit.",
        "Jeffrey: I told you I'm not interested! Back off!",

        "Gus: My girlfriend? Mallet, Alan-Michael, Josh... I even think Reva at some point. Rick...",
        "Harley: What are you babbling about? I was just going down the list of your exes that you were... look, whatever's behind that door-- excuse me-- that would be my past, right? So that would be my responsibility.",
        "Harley: I think I can be a little objective about this...",
        "Gus: No, I just think I should handle it, that's all. Shh. ( Knocks on door )",

        "Alan: I still love Elizabeth, your Honor, but I am more concerned about that little baby's safety. Now, Ms. Boudreau said she and her client knew nothing about this hearing until a short time ago. That simply is not true. You see, I spoke with Mr. Randall right after the baby was born, and I told him about this hearing and what the purpose of it would be. Now, Mr. Randall fled with my granddaughter and her child because he knew that you would rule in my favor.",
        "Reva: That's a lie, Judge.",
        "Judge: Mrs. Lewis...",
        "Reva: No, it's a complete and despicable lie, and you know it!",
        "Judge: Mrs. Lewis, sit down! Mr. Spaulding, is what you told this court true, because if you're lying to me...",
        "Alan: It is true, your Honor.",
        "Reva: And when has he ever lied before? And you're taking his word for it.",
        "Alan: Your Honor, someone else was with me when I told Mr. Randall about this hearing, and she's here today: My wife, Beth.",
        "Judge: Mrs. Spaulding? Mrs. Spaulding, is what your husband told the court true? Were you present for this alleged conversation?",
        "Beth: ( Clears throat ) Yes, your Honor, I was there.",
        "Reva: She's lying, too!",
        "Judge: Quiet, or I will throw you out. Now, is your recollection of this conversation the same as your husband's?",
        "Beth: Yes. My husband told Jonathan that he had filed a custody petition with this court, and that the hearing would be today.",
        "Reva: Come on, Beth. Please, please, don't do this.",
        "Judge: Enough, Mrs. Lewis. No, in fact, I have heard enough, period. I am ready to rule.",
        "Mel: Your Honor, we haven't even presented our case yet.",
        "Judge: You have given me ample documentation of your position, as has Ms. Wolfe. I am ready to rule.",

She's this crazy ride and you can either get on or she's just going to leave you behind. She's been there, she grew up with us, she knows us. They've all three loved her for different reasons. She's the real heart and soul for the Lewis's for sure. From the very beginning, it's always been sort of trying to keep up with her. I mean, she is a Lewis. She's just an amazing person to work with. See Josh and Billy Wednesday, December 6, \"Inside The Light.\"",

        "Doris: You have no connection to this case, Mr. Lewis.",
        "Josh: Excuse me, but up until very recently, I was Jonathan Randall's stepfather, your Honor.",
        "Doris: So?",
        "Josh: If you want to decide this case on its merit, what harm could there be in hearing what I have to say. I promise you that I will present my point in less than three minutes.",
        "Doris: Your Honor.",
        "Judge: All right, sir, I will hold you to that, and not a second more.",
        "Josh: Thank you so much, your Honor. First of all, my name is Joshua Lewis...",
        "Judge: Yes, I know who you are and why you're here.",
        "Josh: Okay, well, if you know that about me, than perhaps you also know that I have two kids, and I freely admit in this courtroom that I am a lousy parent. For instance, your Honor, when my son was very, very young, he decided that he was ready for a two-wheeler. I didn't think he was, but he thought he was. So I put him on that bike, I took him down the sidewalk a little bit, and, of course, he fell over immediately. He hit his chin against the curb and lost a tooth. There was blood, there was crying, all kinds of things. And then when my daughter, she was maybe four years old in a supermarket, she suddenly disappeared. It was one of those times when one time they're right next to you, right there, and then the next minute they're gone. And fortunately she had only gone down to the end of the aisle and she was standing there in front of the candy counter, looking like a zombie, but what if she had decided to climb up that shelf and bottles and cans came tumbling down on top of her? What if the whole unit had come down on top of her, your Honor? The point I'm making here is that as a parent I made a lot of choices and some of them were very poor. Some of them could have been disastrous if it had turned out a different way, if just a couple of things had changed. Now, if you buy the definition of parenting that Ms. Wolfe and Mr. Spaulding have put in this courtroom today, that would make me a bad parent. In fact, it would make me a terrible parent. And I'm willing to bet every dime I have in the bank that it would also make you a terrible parent, Judge.|",

        "Cassie: You could come down to the courthouse with me.",
        "Billy: What part of \"I have something waiting for me\" don't you understand?",
        "Cassie: You know, perhaps I don't understand because I think what you're really saying is you don't want to have a place in this family anymore.",
        "Billy: No. What I'm saying is I need to take care of myself.",
        "Cassie: By being alone?",
        "Billy: I'm not alone. I've got Sheila, come on.",
        "Cassie: Uh huh.",
        "Billy: What's uh huh? She's very nice, she's very sexy. We have a lot of fun.",
        "Cassie: Are you in love with this Sheila person?",
        "Billy: I just met her. Hey, look, are you having fun?",
        "Cassie: Sometimes. Okay, Reva has put some pressure on me and Josh, but I'm not walking away, Billy, and neither is he. Just because things get hard doesn't mean you have to give up.",
        "Billy: Hey, hey, I like Sheila. I like having fun. It's okay to have fun, trust me.",

        "Rich: Yeah? Well, I don't care anymore. Just get this jerk out of my restaurant!",
        "Ava: What the hell are you doing?",

        "Olivia: You could've left if you wanted to.",
        "Jeffrey: I tried to leave. The guy approached me about a job, and I need one. I want to stay away from you and I do want to keep my promise to you and stay away from Ava.",
        "Olivia: Then do.",

        "Bailey: I'm so sorry. I didn't even see you there, Miss...?",
        "Harley: Mrs. Dog.",
        "Gus: Mrs. Aitoro. Listen, Helen... uh, Bailey... uh, yeah, Bailey. Let me explain. I just can't get over...",
        "Harley: How you didn't recognize her. Yeah, it's a funny thing, since she sure recognized you, dog.",
        "Bailey: Don't blame Gus. He knew me as Helen. I always hated it, so a few years ago I started going by my middle name, and now I'm married, so...",
        "Gus: See? Married.",
        "Harley: Like you. It's a funny thing how you don't remember a face like that, honey.",
        "Bailey: Oh, don't blame him. It has been a while. Had a few nips and tucks. I even had a boob job. Nice, huh?",
        "Gus: Yeah. I love your nips.",
        "Harley: Stop now.",
        "Bailey: Listen, Gus and I only worked together for like two months before we were transferred and we only had sex a few times, right?",
        "Harley: ( Coughs )",
        "Gus: Let me explain to you why we're here actually. We had seen your picture. It came up on somebody's computer that we're investigating.",
        "Bailey: Wait, let me guess: Female, petite, about your age, red hair, perky.",
        "Harley: My age? She's five years older than me.",
        "Gus: Yes, that's Blake. That's Blake.",
        "Bailey: She came to see me a while back. She said she was your wife and that she was worried. Apparently a guy named Russ Marler had tipped her off that there was something dangerous in your old service file. This guy was doing research for the government of some kind.",
        "Harley: We knew that about Ross, right?",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Bailey: She asked me to help me get the file from the Bureau. Gus, I thought she was legit, I swear. She knew everything about you. She even had a picture of the two of you together at a party.",
        "Gus: It's all right. So what happened after that?",
        "Bailey: I don't know. I called the Bureau, put in a request for the file, and they'd gotten back to me and informed me that both our files, yours and mine had been sealed for some reason.",
        "Gus: Sealed?",
        "Bailey: It's like we never even existed.",
        "Gus: Well, thank you. We came all this way...",
        "Bailey: For what? I can't help thinking I've made things worse for you guys. You know, once I told that woman, Blake, that your file was sealed, I thought for sure she would come back to me with more questions, but she didn't. So maybe she found the answers she needed somewhere else?",
        "Harley: Well, unfortunately she's in no position to help us right now.",
        "Gus: Do you have a hunch why our files would have been sealed in the first place?",
        "Bailey: I can't imagine it's anything you did. You were a great agent, Gus, one of the best they had.",
        "Harley: Well, since both of your files were sealed, maybe it had something to do with your relationship.",
        "Bailey: We were hardly the only agents doing undercover work. Sorry, I wish I could be of more help, but if I think of anything, I'll call you. Give me your card?",
        "Gus: Oh, absolutely.",
        "Harley: Take mine.",
        "Bailey: Thanks. It was great meeting you, and great seeing you again.",
        "Gus: It was great seeing you, too. Really great.",
        "Harley: Bye!",
        "Gus: Yeah, shame, came all this way and we didn't get any answers or anything. What?",
        "Harley: Nips?",
        "Gus: Stop it. I didn't even... stop.",
        "Harley: How do you expect me to believe that you could forget somebody like that?",
        "Gus: Oh, pl... would you take it easy? Please?",
        "Harley: Take it easy? Maybe you'll find the right answer on the long walk home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: You do have children of your own, right?",
        "Judge: Two daughters and a son.",
        "Josh: Okay, well, do you remember what it was like the first night that you brought that first child home from the hospital? Do you remember what it was like the first time your wife went into labor? I bet you were so freaked out you couldn't even think straight. But isn't that the way it's supposed to be, and the way it is, with every single young couple who embarks on that adventure-- that journey-- of raising children, your Honor? Jonathan and Lizzie, they have not done anything any better or worse than anybody else in this courtroom when they first started that journey. He tried to get her to the hospital as quickly as possible, but the snow slowed him down. And the only reason they left that hospital early-- earlier than Mr. Spaulding would have liked-- was because he threatened them, again. But it's their life, your Honor. It is their child. Now if they were criminals or drug addicts or if they abused this child in some way or abandoned this child, this would be an entirely different conversation. But, your Honor, Jonathan and Lizzie love this baby, and they are doing their best. Their choices are nothing more than that, they are their choices, no one else's, good or bad, right or wrong. My three minutes are up. I'm going to sit down now. Thank you for your time.",
        "Judge: Mr. Lewis, I want to make it perfectly clear that I do not appreciate your grandstanding. However, I happen to agree with you. Mr. Spaulding, you have no case. Dismissed.",
        "Alan: That's impossible, your Honor.",

        "Harley: I guess you can't just call the Bureau, and ask them, \"Hey, guys, why did you steal my file?\"",
        "Gus: No. They're a very, very secretive bunch, you know? F.B.I.",
        "Harley: Still, there's nobody over there you can call and ask them to work a little magic for you?",
        "Gus: No, not anymore.",
        "Harley: Are you even interested in finding out what's in that file there, Gus?",
        "Gus: Yeah, of course I am.",
        "Harley: It's just that you're acting less than enthusiastic about this whole thing.",
        "Gus: No, no, I'm very enthusiastic, I'm dying to know, I'm just trying to you know, protect you.",
        "Harley: Protect me from what?",
        "Gus: God knows how many gorgeous women I've slept with that I just can't remember them all. I can't remember them... where you going?",
        "Harley: I'm sorry, what? Did you say something?",
        "Gus: No, why?",
        "Harley: I'm going to go to the ladies room and then I'm going to call and I'm going check on our children. Remember our children? They're about this high.",
        "Gus: Right.",
        "Harley: And while I'm gone, with that colander-like memory of yours, try not to make any life-altering decisions.",
        "Gus: Okay.",
        "Harley: What's my name?",
        "Gus: Uh... I know what your name is.",
        "Harley: See, that's your trouble right there. That's your trouble right there.",
        "Gus: Hey, Gus Aitoro. Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me not to call the number unless there is an emergency, but this is obviously an emergency, and I really, really need a favor.",

        "Marina: Look, Remy, whatever this is that you are doing for Tammy, I promise you it is only going to make you feel worse in the end. I'm sorry, but Tammy is glued to bad boy Jon Randall, and a bad boy addiction is a hard one to break.",
        "Remy: Is that why you're single at the moment? You're waiting for trouble to walk in the door?",
