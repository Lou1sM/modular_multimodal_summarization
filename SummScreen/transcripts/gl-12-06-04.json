        "Sebastian: Holly?",
        "Holly: Who else? What a surprise.",
        "Sebastian: Well, it shouldn't be. I told you I'd be back.",
        "Holly: You also threw in that I might die here on my own. And then I heard you collapse on my trusty radiophone.",
        "Sebastian: So, what? You thought I was dead?",
        "Holly: Maybe, maybe not. But the door was still locked.",
        "Sebastian: Well, I'm here now, so you're not alone anymore.",
        "Holly: Oh, good. Then everything is all right. (Laughs bitterly)",
        "Sebastian: Well, I hope so, because that's what I want. That's why I've done everything I've done.",
        "Holly: (Laughs)",
        "Sebastian: What? What's funny?",
        "Holly: You, me, this whole gothic novel situation. I mean, all this trouble, for what? We're both going to die here, right, so nothing really matters.",
        "Sebastian: No. You matter. The fact that you and I are both still here, in this moment, matters.",
        "Holly: If you say so! (Laughs)",
        "Sebastian: Holly? My God. Are you drunk?",
        "Holly: (Laughs)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Olivia! Olivia!",
        "Olivia: Bill. I will always remember our honeymoon at the beach. It was an incredible gift; on top of everything you've already given Emma and me. I just can't stay here. You deserve to be happy and free, and so do I, and neither of us will be if I stick around, because this whole town is going to think I killed Phillip. Your life will be made hell right along with mine, and that's the last thing I want for you. So I have to say good-bye. Good luck. And thanks for the snow. It was a really nice touch, your partner, Olivia.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Hi. She asleep?",
        "Nanny: Yeah.",
        "Olivia: Listen, I'm sorry I'm late. I got a little tied up. Have they called the flight yet?",
        "Nanny: 15 minutes ago. I thought you changed your mind.",
        "Olivia: No. Emma and I are going to San Cristobal tonight. I'm not looking back. (Cell phone ringing) Excuse me.",
        "Bill: Olivia? Olivia? Olivia, are you there? Answer me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: No, no, no, no. See, this is not how we're supposed to do this.",
        "Edmund: We've been together how long, and now you tell me?",
        "Cassie: No, I don't mean that, Edmund. I just... I'm not going to be ovulating for a couple more days, and if we want to make a baby, this is just not the right time.",
        "Edmund: So we should wait.",
        "Cassie: Just a couple more days.",
        "Edmund: Okay.",
        "Cassie: So that's it? You're just going to stop?",
        "Edmund: Well, if the timing's not right, I can wait if you can.",
        "Cassie: I can wait.",
        "Edmund: Good. All right then, we'll wait.",
        "Cassie: That's long enough.",
        "Edmund: Yeah. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Wait a minute, wait a minute.",
        "Dinah: No, no, no, no.",
        "Jeffrey: I need to get something.",
        "Dinah: I've got it.",
        "Jeffrey: What?",
        "Dinah: This ought to do the trick.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: This is not what I wanted.",
        "Holly: (Gasps) Isn't it funny how our plans get all screwed up? I mean, look at me, for instance. I planned to stay sober.",
        "Sebastian: Why couldn't you have just waited until I returned? I told you I was going to be back soon.",
        "Holly: Oh, maybe I didn't believe you. Or maybe I did, and I thought you were dead. Or maybe I just gave up hope. Anyway, I figure if I am going to die, I am going to have one last little binge-a-roonie.",
        "Sebastian: No, Holly, Holly, you're not dead, okay?",
        "Holly: Not yet. But let's look on the brighter side. I'm still kicking, and the party's going to start over again, so why don't you get me a couple of these?",
        "Sebastian: No. No. No. Not even if this was it, if this was the end for us, I wouldn't do that. And I wouldn't have you waste our precious last moments together staring into the bottom of a glass.",
        "Holly: Oh, Sebastian. You're no fun. What's the matter? Don't you like seeing me like this?",
        "Sebastian: No. No, I don't.",
        "Holly: Next time, you leave me a case or two of wine, vodka, whatever you've got, and you go to Africa and you find your cure, and you just take your time.",
        "Sebastian: You know what? I am running out of time, Holly, and I just... damn it, I just wish you would have waited until I returned, just trusted me enough not to...",
        "Holly: I wish you'd trusted me enough not to lock me inside my cage!",
        "Sebastian: Coffee. Coffee. You need coffee.",
        "Holly: Great. Then I'll be drunk and wide-awake.",
        "Sebastian: Do you have any idea how much more difficult this is going to be now? But I can do this, okay? I can get you through this.",
        "Holly: Why? Why do you bother? Why do you care?",
        "Sebastian: Because I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Olivia, are you there? Answer me. Olivia, I know you're there. Just don't do this. You can't just... you can't just disappear. Just tell me where you are.",
        "Announcer: Continuing boarding flight 411 to San Cristobal. Will standby passenger Higby please come to the check-in counter?",
        "Bill: The airport. The airport. No, Olivia, don't... hello?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: That was such a waste of time.",
        "Edmund: Thanks. Thanks.",
        "Cassie: No, no, no, no. Not that it wasn't amazing. It was. It's just... I mean the odds of me getting pregnant tonight are slim to none. We haven't even got the test results back to figure out if I can get pregnant the old- fashioned way again.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, if it happened once, it can happen again. The key here is perseverance, and I, for one, plan on pressing the issue.",
        "Cassie: (Laughs) Wait a second. No. See, you're supposed to be saving up for when the time is right.",
        "Edmund: I promise you, when the time is right, I will rise to the occasion. Come here.",
        "Cassie: You are so bad!",
        "Edmund: Cassie. Cassie, listen, if our having sex is all part of some doctor- prescribed baby-making regimen, then for best results, I think we need to be good patients and apply ourselves fully. Throw ourselves into this body and soul.",
        "Cassie: So where are we going to start? Body or soul?",
        "Edmund: You guess. I'll give you a hint.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: What are you thinking?",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, just, you know, how many times we've done this.",
        "Dinah: Hm. You still seem to enjoy it.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, you know, it has its moments, doesn't it?",
        "Dinah: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jeffrey: And you certainly came prepared to enjoy yourself.",
        "Dinah: Yeah. It's 2004, Jeffrey. I mean, you know, I'm a modern woman. Women carry condoms in their purses all the time, just in case.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, you've never done that before with me.",
        "Dinah: You can't be too careful these days.",
        "Jeffrey: Hm. Yeah.",
        "Dinah: I'm just taking care of myself, that's all.",
        "Jeffrey: Right.",
        "Dinah: What are you doing? Jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: Are you out of your mind?",
        "Dinah: Excuse me?",
        "Jeffrey: This wrapper! It's got holes in it, Dinah. Pinholes!",
        "Dinah: What do you want me to say? It's defective. What?",
        "Jeffrey: Defective, is it? Yeah. What's this? Huh? Does this come in handy, huh? \"Just in case?\"",
        "Dinah: You know it's really cool of you to be going through my stuff.",
        "Jeffrey: Pinholes on both sides, huh? That means what's inside must have holes in it, too. Trying to get pregnant, are we?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: I hate seeing you like this.",
        "Holly: You ain't seen nothing yet.",
        "Sebastian: I've seen enough. Stop.",
        "Holly: (Laughs) Oh, stop. I stopped. I did stop. For six years, I stopped. I got sober, I turned my whole life around, I made a complete circle, and I ended up right where I started. (Laughs)",
        "Sebastian: It doesn't have to be that way, Holly.",
        "Holly: What was I supposed to do? You left me here. And I thought I was going to die in here. I thought I would never see anybody that I cared about anymore. I heard Blake on that... that radio thing, and I screamed. She couldn't hear me. And you, who promised me to come back, I hear you collapse on the phone, and I figure that's it. This is all I get. I'm going to die in here. So I thought I would just stop feeling anything. You know how it is.",
        "Sebastian: No. It's not the same.",
        "Holly: You thought you cared about me, but you lock me up in here? You leave me here? You drive me to drink, and now you act like I've done something to you!",
        "Sebastian: This isn't you.",
        "Holly: How do you know? You don't know me.",
        "Sebastian: Yes, I do.",
        "Holly: You don't know anything.",
        "Sebastian: You can't be this way.",
        "Holly: Why not?",
        "Sebastian: Because, Holly, I... I brought you here to be here.",
        "Holly: You brought me here. Why? You brought me here to what? You brought me here to live up to some perfect image of Holly in the pictures, Holly in Roger's stories? You brought me here to what? To save you? Well, I'm sorry, man. I can't even save myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Look, Jeffrey, I don't know what you think you saw.",
        "Jeffrey: You tried to lure me into bed. You tricked me into having sex because something in your twisted little mind told you that you ought to have a baby.",
        "Dinah: Yeah. And what's wrong with that? Women become mothers. They have babies to love.",
        "Jeffrey: Mothers usually give the fathers a say in the matter, and my say is, I don't want a baby, especially not with you.",
        "Dinah: You know something? You are ego! You are pure ego! Why would you think that I am just so unbelievably attracted to you that I would have to have your child? You know what, Jeffrey? You're safe. I don't want you.",
        "Jeffrey: Just what I can give you, is that it?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Yeah. I want a baby. I want something to love that will love me back unconditionally.",
        "Jeffrey: Get a cocker spaniel.",
        "Dinah: You are so cynical. It's not like this is going to affect you.",
        "Jeffrey: What?",
        "Dinah: From now on, I don't want your involvement. I don't want your support. I don't want anything. I wasn't even going to tell you that you were the father of this child until you found that stupid wrapper. I am going on this alone.",
        "Jeffrey: Alone? Well, biology news flash, Dinah: You don't make a baby alone, okay? There's two people involved, and I don't want to be the sperm donor!",
        "Dinah: You are too late. You're too late, buddy, because I got a good, warm feeling that this mission is accomplished.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Please tell me that Olivia is in the ladies' room changing Emma.",
        "Nanny: No, they left.",
        "Bill: What do you mean they left? What flight are they on?",
        "Nanny: I don't know.",
        "Bill: Just tell me. Where did they go?",
        "Nanny: I can't.",
        "Bill: Why not?",
        "Nanny: Olivia was afraid you'd come after them.",
        "Bill: Jane, I'm her husband. I'm going to find out whether she went whether you clue me in or not, so please just tell me where she went.",
        "Olivia: You forgot her ear medication. I thought she might be uncomfortable on the flight without them, so I got her some more.",
        "Bill: Flight to where?",
        "Olivia: Give me that.",
        "Bill: Jane, would you please just give Emma these eardrops? Come here.",
        "Olivia: What?",
        "Bill: Come here. I need to talk to you without any distractions. Jane, would you please just give us a couple of minutes? You didn't say good-bye.",
        "Olivia: The note was good-bye.",
        "Bill: The note doesn't count. I want to hear the words.",
        "Olivia: All right, fine. Good-bye.",
        "Bill: Hold it hold it.",
        "Olivia: Look, I think I made things pretty clear, okay? This is the best thing for both of us.",
        "Bill: What, by taking off and just leaving a note behind?",
        "Olivia: It's just what had to be, okay?",
        "Bill: No, it didn't have to be this way, Olivia. But it proves one thing: That you're chicken.",
        "Olivia: What?",
        "Bill: Yeah. You were afraid to tell me that you were leaving, because you know if you did, I was going to change your mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: Drink it, careful, careful. You don't even realize what you are do you?",
        "Holly: I have a pretty good idea. Don't look at me like that. Your expectations are as bad as these bars.",
        "Sebastian: I brought you here, Holly, because I had hopes of being cured, but if the cure didn't come in time, then at the very least I could have you, here.",
        "Holly: Well, I'm sorry to burst your bubble, but I'm nobody's caretaker. I am a mess, in case you haven't noticed.",
        "Sebastian: No, you're not.",
        "Holly: What do you want? What do you really want?",
        "Sebastian: Nobody wants to die alone, Holly. Nobody wants to die without someone.",
        "Holly: We're all going to die alone. I can't be what you need me to be. And you're not going to let me go. So just give me another bottle and let me... let me go. (Sobs)",
        "Sebastian: No. No. Look I did it, I needed something from you. Yeah, I did. But now you know what? You need me, and I'm going to take care of you, Holly. I'm going to take care of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Now I'm exhausted.",
        "Edmund: Amateur.",
        "Cassie: (Laughs)",
        "Edmund: My pulse barely broke 300.",
        "Cassie: Someone could walk in here right now and see us like this--see you like that. (Laughs)",
        "Edmund: I know. Isn't it great? (Laughter) Cassie, Cassie, this is all a clinically approved, doctor-recommended activity. There is nothing, nothing to be ashamed of.",
        "Cassie: You make it sound like a lab experiment.",
        "Edmund: The only things missing are safety goggles and latex gloves.",
        "Cassie: Oh, man.",
        "Edmund: That gives me an idea. What's that look for? Hey, you haven't had a change of heart or anything?",
        "Cassie: No. No, not at all, I just... it's amazing. A couple of months ago, we were making love and we had no idea we were making a baby.",
        "Edmund: It's nothing short of miraculous.",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Edmund: Then again, so is the fact that you seem to be interested in diving into my gene pool.",
        "Cassie: Stop it, okay?",
        "Edmund: Stop what?",
        "Cassie: Stop tearing yourself down.",
        "Edmund: Come on, Cassie. Half a year ago, the entire world thought I was Vlad the Impaler.",
        "Cassie: I don't. And I don't care what anyone else thinks. But you bring it up, I ran into Jonathan the other day at Reva's.",
        "Edmund: What happened?",
        "Cassie: He was needling me about us having a baby, and how it could turn out to be just like him.",
        "Edmund: Well, Cassie, it could be like me, too. It's in the genes.",
        "Cassie: Our kid could be anything, Edmund--good, bad, or anything in between. What I do know is that our child is going to be loved and valued and taken care of, every single day of his or her life. That's what's important.",
        "Edmund: Here's what I know. I know the only thing I'm really looking forward to is spending the rest of my life with you, loving you and your children and whatever other children we happen to have along the way, because the only thing I'm certain of is, I'm the luckiest man in the world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: I just want what everybody else has.",
        "Jeffrey: Everybody else?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. You ever take a good look at who's walking the streets in this town? Huh? They're people. They're people in love, who are married, having babies. I deserve to have a baby.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, does the baby deserve to have you? Do you ever think about that? This is a strange, foreign notion to you, but think about someone else besides yourself, just for one minute, okay?",
        "Dinah: Jeffrey, I would make a great mother.",
        "Jeffrey: You're desperate, you're angry, you're needy. What kind of life is that going to be for the kid?",
        "Dinah: That's right. That's right. Because the only woman worthy of motherhood would be Cassie--perfect Princess Cassie, who could give her child everything!",
        "Jeffrey: A lot more than you could.",
        "Dinah: Love, care, guidance.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, that's right. All that, for example.",
        "Dinah: Yeah? Well, then why don't you tell me what happened with Tammy, huh? I think she fell off the job with that one.",
        "Jeffrey: Tammy is a teenager, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: Who I talked into going home for Thanksgiving. She didn't even want to be around her poor mother, who has two kids of her own, anyway, one of them Hart's. What do I have? Absolutely nothing, sir!",
        "Jeffrey: Calm down. Calm down. Dinah, you are a strong, beautiful...",
        "Dinah: Jeffrey, Cassie and Edmund are ready to give her yet another baby-- number four. And what do you think that means, huh? I'll tell you what that means. That means we need to stop them.",
        "Jeffrey: All right, let me get this straight. You want to somehow prevent Edmund and Cassie from conceiving a child.",
        "Dinah: You bet I do.",
        "Jeffrey: How? Why? Don't answer that, okay? I don't want to know. I'm not interested.",
        "Dinah: Jeffrey, I think that you do want to hear this.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, I think that you have lost what little you have left of your mind. Now, you come in here obsessed with having a child yourself, and now you're onto Edmund and Cassie's baby? (Laughs)",
        "Dinah: They haven't made one yet, and we can stop them.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, I get it. This is all part of your pathological competition with Cassie, isn't it?",
        "Dinah: No.",
        "Jeffrey: You know, you need help, Dinah. You need serious help. Why don't you get some?",
        "Dinah: You know, for a smart man, you sure are thinking small.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, and what big piece of the puzzle am I missing here?",
        "Dinah: You.",
        "Jeffrey: Excuse me?",
        "Dinah: Jeffrey, I've gotten past the tit-for-tat mentality that I've had towards Cassie.",
        "Jeffrey: Sure you have.",
        "Dinah: And what I am after now is for both of us to get what we want.",
        "Jeffrey: What I want is for you to hit the door.",
        "Dinah: This is your big chance, as much as it is mine. And if you trust me, you won't blow it.",
        "Jeffrey: What chance are we talking about here, Dinah?",
        "Dinah: Your chance to have Cassie.",
        "Jeffrey: My chance to have Cassie. Would you listen to yourself for one second? Next time you see the shrink, make sure he gives you a prescription for something very strong, all right?",
        "Dinah: Jeffrey. Jeffrey, don't dance around this. Come on. You want her. You know it, and I know it. And once Cassie and Edmund get married and have a child, no one will be able to come in between them, not anymore.",
        "Jeffrey: You know, first you're obsessed with having a baby of your own, and now you're obsessed with preventing Cassie from having a baby. Well, you know what, Dinah? As far as the first obsession is concerned, I'm going to go with the odds and believe that you're not pregnant. And besides, I don't want to be the father of your own little personal bundle of Mommy-love, okay? And as far as the second obsession is concerned, I told you before: Stay clear of Cassie and Edmund. You got it? And another thing, this will definitely be the last time that we ever sleep together.",
        "Dinah: Are you sure about that? Because tonight, when you slept with me, it seemed like that was exactly what you needed. I felt it. You wanted to forget that I wasn't Cassie.",
        "Jeffrey: Get out.",
        "Dinah: Jeffrey, I have helped you, and now I am asking for your help. If you do, it is a win-win deal. I get what I want, and you get to be with the woman that you will never really forget.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Okay, tomatoes, lettuce, ham, swiss, turkey.",
        "Edmund: Can this wait?",
        "Cassie: You can't be serious. Who us (laughs you're turning into some kind of a lab partner.",
        "Edmund: I'll tell you what.",
        "Cassie: Hm?",
        "Edmund: Let's go back to the laboratory. You can bring that experiment with you if you'd like. What do you think?",
        "Cassie: How are we supposed to plan a wedding if we're having sex every two minutes?",
        "Edmund: Well, we can do it in bed with a pen and a pad of paper. (Cell phone ringing) Don't answer that. It's probably the doctor who's going to tell us we have to spend the rest of our lives, until it's time, in separate bedrooms.",
        "Cassie: Oh, it is. It's Dr. Sheehan. Hello? Hi, doctor. Yes, I'm fine. Matter of fact, I'm great. Really? Oh. Okay. Um, when? All right. Okay. Thank you for calling. Bye.",
        "Edmund: Is anything wrong? Did he get the test results back or something?",
        "Cassie: No, he just wanted to remind me that we still had some more tests to take.",
        "Edmund: (Laughs) You're kidding. You were in with him for hours. What else could there be?",
        "Cassie: Well, I think when we go back into the laboratory that you need to rest, because he wants us back into his office as soon as possible.",
        "Edmund: For what? More tests?",
        "Cassie: Mm-hmm. And this time it's your turn.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Olivia, you can't just run away. It's not only wrong, it's dumb.",
        "Olivia: I suppose you're going to tell me why.",
        "Bill: Why do you think? Phillip Spaulding has been murdered, Olivia Spencer is a suspect, and she skips town? That makes you look guilty, which we both know you're not.",
        "Olivia: Well, thanks for the vote of confidence. Good-bye.",
        "Bill: Look, it's not that I'm not worried about you. And yes, your note probably got it right. Most of the people in this town think you're guilty.",

        "Bill: It's not going to happen.",
        "Olivia: How do you know that?",
        "Bill: Because I just do.",
        "Olivia: What, did you look in your magic crystal ball and that just makes it so?",
        "Bill: Just...",
        "Olivia: If I end up behind bars, what happens to Emma?",
        "Bill: Just...",
        "Olivia: You know what happens to her. She ends up with those people.",
        "Bill: The Spaulding's, right.",
        "Olivia: Yes. Once they get their claws on her, they're never going to let her go. It's what Phillip wanted, and now it's what Alan and Lizzie want, too.",
        "Bill: I know you love Emma more than...",
        "Olivia: More than my own life. You know those people. They don't stop until they get what they want, and what they want right now is Emma, okay? So I have to get out of here while I still have the chance. Besides...",
        "Bill: Besides what? I mean, what else are you running from?",
        "Olivia: You.",
        "Bill: I just threw you a frozen honeymoon...",
        "Olivia: No, you've done more than that. You kept me from being deported, but you also stepped up and you protected us. And now your name is getting dragged through the mud because you're linked up to a murder suspect.",
        "Bill: So you figured you'd just unlink us?",
        "Olivia: Yeah. You've been hit again and again. You deserve a break, Bill. You deserve a better life.",
        "Bill: The idea being my life would be better without you.",
        "Olivia: Yeah.",
        "Bill: Is that it? Yeah? Hm.",
        "Olivia: Look, this is your chance to start over, without any strings or baggage or responsibility, so I'm letting you go. I'm letting you go forward.",
        "Announcer: Final boarding call for flight 411 to San Cristobal.",
        "Bill: That's where you're going?",
        "Olivia: I have ruined three marriages so far, okay? I couldn't bear the thought of ruining this one, too, not after everything. It's time to go.",
        "Bill: I don't want you to.",

        "Sebastian: I can't, Holly. I'm sorry.",
        "Holly: You can't let me go, and you won't give me a drink. I'm not liking this party very much.",
        "Sebastian: Holly, come on. Come on.",
        "Holly: Come on, come on, I just want a drink. You know, it's all I'm going to think about until you give me one, so why don't you just give me a glass of wine? Just one glass.",
        "Sebastian: No. No. No. You need rest, okay?",
        "Holly: I thought you cared so much about me.",

        "Holly: It's gone. It's already gone.",
        "Sebastian: No. No, it's not gone. And even if we only had one more day, one more hour, we make it count. Holly, look at me. We're here. We're here together. And if this was it, you know, if this was the end for me, then at the very least, I want to be able to look into your clear, beautiful eyes, and I... I want you to know that my life has meaning, because I found my way. I found my way, Holly. So don't worry. I'm here. I'm going to take care of you. Okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Yes, it is true. I married you to keep you and Emma from being deported, and I was cool with that. I think it's good to help people when they need it.",
        "Olivia: You kind of make it sound like you gave me a hand changing a flat.",
        "Bill: Will you please just let me explain?",
        "Olivia: Sure.",
        "Bill: Thank you. I just... at the beach, when I got your note, I just saw my life flash with you gone forever. And Olivia, that... that wouldn't make my life better. If anything, it's going to make it worse.",
        "Olivia: Really?",
        "Bill: Really. Like, I couldn't use the carpool lane anymore, you know, with you gone.",
        "Olivia: Well, that would be a tragedy.",
        "Bill: Yeah. It would be horrible. And you know I couldn't shop at price mart. I mean do you know how long it takes for one person to finish a two-gallon tub of mayonnaise?",
        "Olivia: That's a lot of sandwiches.",
        "Bill: It is. It's a lot of sandwiches. And how else am I going to explain that women's underwear in my top drawer with you gone?",
        "Olivia: I was wondering who that leopard print belonged to.",
        "Bill: The cat's out of the bag. You know what else I couldn't do? Kidnap you and drag you down to a frozen beach, make love to you. I'd miss that. Wouldn't you?",
        "Olivia: Maybe a little.",
        "Bill: Look, I know why you're running away, and I know you're scared that they're going to take Emma away, but I promise you, I promise you this: That I am going to do whatever it takes to protect you and your daughter, and I will be by your side... well, for as long as you quit... stop being so stubborn and get this idea of running away out of your head.",
        "Olivia: Is that an order?",
        "Bill: Yes. Yes, it is. Don't go. Just don't go. Now, come on. I am taking you home with me, where you belong. Okay? (Laughs)",
        "Olivia: Um, I'll make you a sandwich.",

        "Cassie: Well, Edmund, you don't think I would be more than willing to give you some help? After all, it is in the interest of science.",

        "Dinah: I think I've got a better grip than you think I do. And as far as my obsessions, as you call them, I know the odds of getting pregnant. But I also know what I want, and I won't give up on it. And as far as the Cassie and Edmund side of things, well, I have one request of you, and that is for you to stay away from my plans, from here on in.",
        "Jeffrey: (Laughs) So, what, I'm just supposed to, like, hang out on the sidelines and watch you try to destroy Cassie's life again?",
        "Dinah: I'm not going to hurt her. I'm going to be doing her a favor, and you, because you could end up with Cassie.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, you know what? I've listened to this much madness. Go ahead. Tell me. How do you figure that?",
        "Dinah: Jeffrey, I know things, okay? Facts, things that you don't need to know, but would absolutely destroy Cassie and Edmund, cause major problems.",
        "Jeffrey: How's that?",
        "Dinah: Because Cassie and Edmund are completely wrong for one another, and what I know proves it, and it will prove it to Cassie, and could send her straight to you.",
        "Jeffrey: All right. That's enough.",
        "Dinah: You've been waiting for Cassie to come to you on her own, but she hasn't. And maybe you don't have a plan to gain your heart's desire, but I do. You let me get what I want here, and I promise you, you will wind up with what you want as well. This is a golden opportunity, your last one. Okay, the time, it's ticking.
