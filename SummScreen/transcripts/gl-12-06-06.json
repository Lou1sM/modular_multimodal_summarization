        "Billy: Milan. Yeah, we're going to get on a jet and go to Italy, take a train \r\nup through the Alps to Switzerland. ",
        "Sheila: You are such a crazy man. First, you kidnap me. ",
        "Billy: And now, we're going to go over there and get some coffee while I call \r\nthe Lewis jet and see if I can get it. Are you in? ",
        "Sheila: Billy, I have to go to work. ",
        "Billy: Oh, come on. ",
        "Sheila: I'm late as it is. ",
        "Billy: Blow it off. ",
        "Sheila: I can\u2019t. ",
        "Billy: Come on. Well, then, retire. ",
        "Sheila: Very funny. You can't be serious. ",
        "Billy: Hey, look, what did responsibility ever get anybody, anyway? I mean, I \r\ntook care of Reva when she was sick. I mean, I devoted my whole life to it, \r\nand... ",
        "Sheila: And what? ",
        "Billy: And she got better. ",
        "Sheila: Well, isn't it enough to just get? Billy, you are such an amazing \r\nman, and you have so much to offer. But you're the only person that doesn't seem \r\nto get that. ",
        "Billy: Well, thank you for saying the nice things. ",
        "Sheila: No, I mean it. You always sell yourself short. You've got to go find \r\nthat next mountain to climb. You know, power is a strong aphrodisiac",
        "Billy: So is Italy.",
        "Sheila: Call me, cowboy. Hey, Tracy, it's me. Yeah, I'm running a little \r\nlate. ",
        "",
        "Josh: Okay. Good job. Here you go. ",
        "Matt: So sign off. ",
        "Josh: Yeah, I will, as soon as you've made the additions. ",
        "Matt: Josh, I've been putting off the client for weeks, waiting for you to \r\napprove these plans. ",
        "Josh: I know. I've just been a little busy with the hospital project. ",
        "Matt: Yeah, you've been a lot busy with the hospital project, and that puts \r\nup backed up on every one of our projects. ",
        "Cassie: Okay, how about if I pitch in somehow? ",
        "Josh: Okay, how about if the two of you go back to the office, and I'll call \r\nGrabowski myself and explain what the holdup was? How's that? ",
        "Matt: Yeah, well, you better call O\u2019Connell, too, because he's talking about \r\nwalking. ",
        "Josh: Okay. Consider it done. ",
        "Matt: Okay. ",
        "Cassie: Good luck. ",
        "Josh: Thank you. Don't need luck. I need a clone. ",
        "Billy: Hey, you got one. Yeah, see, I'm the answer to your prayers, little \r\nbrother. ",
        "Josh: Really? ",
        "Billy: Yeah, I want to come back to the company full-time-- as a full \r\npartner, of course. And I figured you'd take care of the hospital, and I'll \r\noversee everything else. What do you say? ",
        "Josh: I think that's a really bad idea. ",
        "Matt: Let's roll. ",
        "Josh: Let's do it. Uh-oh. ",
        "Cassie: Uh-oh? What? What is it? ",
        "Josh: It's just a little business I thought I had finished. ",
        "Billy: Yeah, I asked Josh for my job back at the company. ",
        "Cassie: Oh? And what did Josh say? ",
        "Billy: Well, let's put it this way. I don't think we discussed it as fully as \r\nwe might have. ",
        "Josh: Maybe not. I'll see you back at the office, okay? ",
        "Cassie: You do realize Billy is exactly what we need. ",
        "Josh: Yeah, I know. I'll see you back at the office. Oh, okay, maybe you're \r\nright. I didn\u2019t give you a chance to finish what you were saying.",
        "Billy: Well, that\u2019s good, because...",
        "Josh: But, I remember the last time you fell off the wagon, even if you \r\ndon\u2019t. I really don't want to put you in a position to be tempted again. ",
        "Billy: Hey, thanks for the vote of confidence. ",
        "Josh: See, Billy, I really don't want to find out that you were wrong about \r\nyour sobriety when we're pushing a deadline. ",
        "Billy: Look, little brother, you're already missing deadlines. You need what \r\nI have and what I can bring to the table. So let's clear the air here, also. \r\nThis isn't about my drinking. ",
        "Josh: My answer is still no. ",
        "Billy: Well, it's not actually your call. You see, H.B. left a little \r\nprovision in the will that there will always be a place for me at Lewis. ",
        "Josh: What did you do, look that up somewhere? I mean, are you trying to \r\nsandbag me? What's going on? ",
        "Billy: Well, I was hoping I wouldn't have to. I was hoping you would say \r\n\"Welcome back, boss.\" ",
        "Josh: Yeah, well, you know what? I'm the guy in charge, Billy, so that means \r\nit's up to me to make any personnel decisions and changes. It\u2019s only up to me \r\nand me alone.",
        "Billy: I will fight for what's mine, little brother. ",
        "Josh: And I will fight right back, big brother. I don't care. What do you \r\nwant to do? You want to go to Oklahoma, talk to daddy's lawyer? Because I'll do \r\nthat, if that's what you want to do. ",
        "Billy: Let's go. ",
        "Josh: Looks like we're making a little trip, doesn't it? ",
        "Billy: Looks like we are. ",
        "",
        "Billy: Okay, you didn't call him, did you, about the jet? ",
        "Josh: What the hell are you talking about? I called him, all right? Brad is \r\ngoing to be here any minute, and he's going to fly us out of here. ",
        "Billy: You told me that 30 minutes ago. ",
        "Josh: Yeah, well, the man is late. That's it, end of story. In fact, he's \r\nprobably fueling up the jet as we speak. ",
        "Billy: That's what you told me 45 minutes ago. ",
        "Josh: Look, Billy-- damn it! What's the matter with you? Why would I not call \r\nthe pilot? ",
        "Billy: Because you don't want to go to Oklahoma and find out you were wrong.\r\n",
        "Josh: Yeah, well, you know what? You figured it out. I would much rather be \r\nhere in an airport, arguing with you. ",
        "Billy: That's right. You're probably right. ",
        "Josh: I'll tell you what, Billy. You know what? Why don't you call him? Here.\r\n",
        "Billy: Oh, no. You already called him. ",
        "Josh: No, no, call him. ",
        "Billy: No, no, you call him. ",
        "Josh: Call him. Call him! ",
        "Brad: Sorry, sorry, sorry. I'm late. ",
        "Josh: Did you get married?",
        "Brad: I think. ",
        "Josh: Okay, okay. And dumb question: Have you been drinking? ",
        "Brad: Since I said \"I do.\" ",
        "Josh: Why don't you check into a commercial flight, and I will put this man \r\nin a cab. Come on. ",
        "Brad: No, no, no, no. I'm good to go. ",
        "Josh: Easy, easy. Hey, hey! ",
        "Brad: Excuse me, ma'am. ",
        "Josh: Okay, can you get that thing? ",
        "Billy: Yeah. ",
        "Josh: Come on, big guy. We've got you. Come on up. Get him up. I've got you. \r\nOkay. Now, this is a little closer than I really want to be. Easy, easy, easy. \r\nOw. Oh, that hurt. Okay. ",
        "",
        "Billy: When is the next flight after this one? ",
        "Ticket agent: 12 hours. ",
        "Billy: I will take those two seats. ",
        "Ticket agent: Name of the other passenger? ",
        "Billy: No, they're both for me. I like to stretch out, okay? ",
        "Josh: Okay, how we doing on that flight to Tulsa?",
        "Ticket agent: That flight is full. ",
        "Josh: Really? Why are you holding my brother's credit card then? ",
        "Billy: Well, let's see. I got the last two seats for us. ",
        "Ticket agent: Sir, I thought you wanted them both for yourself. ",
        "Josh: Oh, I get it. You were thinking you would get to Tulsa first and look \r\nat the will by yourself. That's not going to happen, okay? The second \r\npassenger's name is Joshua Lewis, who happens to be very hungry. Are they going \r\nto serve a meal on the flight, by any chance? Yeah, I guess those days are over, \r\naren't they? Okay. Well, I think the concession stand is closed, so you got \r\nanother one of those, or... hmm. Oh, well, you know, the turbulence is just so \r\nlovely on this flight. It's a good thing I didn't eat anything before, because \r\nyou'd be wearing it right now. ",
        "Billy: Oh, goodie. Let me have your peanuts. ",
        "Josh: No, I don't think so. ",
        "Billy: Come on, you just said you didn't feel good. ",
        "Josh: You can't have my nuts, okay, Billy? ",
        "Billy: You know, Josh, the night that I fell off the wagon was also the night \r\nthat Reva was going to meet Elvis, you know what I mean? End it all. ",
        "Josh: And? ",
        "Billy: And it's a pretty darn good reason for taking a drink. I'm not trying \r\nto defend myself. ",
        "Josh: Well, that's good, because there really is no good reason, Billy, \r\nespecially for someone with your history. Could you not stick your elbow in my \r\nribs? ",
        "Billy: Just move over. ",
        "Josh: I am over! Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Oh, man! Great! ",
        "Flight attendant: I am so sorry. ",
        "Billy: I think it looks good on him. ",
        "Josh: Do you have something I can use to clean this up? ",
        "Billy: Yeah, a big nappie or a diaper? ",
        "Josh: Stop it. ",
        "Pilot: This is your pilot, Hal \"Your pal\" Masterson. Well, I have some good \r\nnews and some bad news. The good news is, we're not going to crash. ( Laughter )\r\n",
        "Josh: Oh, God, that's our pilot. ",
        "Pilot: The bad news is, we're being diverted to Wichita. ",
        "",
        "Josh: Oh. ( Groaning ) ",
        "Billy: You know, you should\u2019ve known about Brad, we could have been on a big \r\njet with lots of leg room. ",
        "Josh: Oh, come on. What, are you kidding me? You going to blame me for this \r\nnow? I mean, you mount this big operation to get yourself back in the company, \r\nand somehow us getting diverted to Kansas is my fault? ",
        "Billy: Well, I just want you to admit it, that's all. ",
        "Josh: Admit what? ",
        "Billy: Admit that you don't want me back in the company because I protected \r\nReva. It's true. ",
        "Josh: Billy... could you not stand on top of me, please? Look, I'm keeping \r\nyou out of the company to protect the company. ",
        "Billy: No. You're mad at me because I didn't tell you about Reva having \r\ncancer. It was not my call. ",
        "Josh: Okay, well, was falling in love with her your call? ",
        "Billy: I've always been in love with Reva. Have you always been in love with \r\nCassie? ",
        "Josh: You and Reva left me out in the cold, Billy. ",
        "Billy: Oh. And Cassie kept you warm. I get it. ",
        "Josh: Oh, do you, really? ",
        "Billy: Yeah. Do you love Cassie the way that you love Reva?",
        "Josh: I Love Cassie. ",
        "Billy: Aha. No, no, no. Why don't you just admit that I'm right? You couldn't \r\nkeep your pants zipped. ",
        "Josh: You know what? ",
        "Billy: Hey, hey, hey, hey! ",
        "Josh: You don't know what you're talking about, so why don't you just shut up \r\nright now? ",
        "Billy: Why don't you admit that I'm right, and let's go back home? ",
        "Josh: You know what I think I'm going to do? I'm going to take maybe a train \r\nto Tulsa, okay? ",
        "Billy: All right, I'll take a bus. ",
        "Josh: Good. Take a bus. Fine. ",
        "Billy: I'll see you when I see you. ",
        "Josh: Yeah, I'll see you when I see you. That's fine. ",
        "Billy: Or we could... ",
        "Josh: No! Good-bye. ",
        "Billy: That's exactly my thoughts, too. ",
        "",
        "Josh: You know what? I'll take a full-size, whatever you got. ",
        "Desk clerk: All out. ",
        "Josh: Fine. Mid-size, compact, luxury-- I don't care. What, you got nothing? \r\nI'll take a hearse at this point. ",
        "Desk clerk: I've got one, but it's not very reliable. ",
        "Josh: I'll take it. Did you get mugged? ",
        "Billy: No. The bus window was broken with the hail stones about a mile down \r\nthe road, I walked and I\u2019m soaked. Okay, I would like a car, please. ",
        "Josh: You know what? I just got the last one. ",
        "Billy: Well, then, I would like you to offer me a lift. ",
        "Josh: Yeah, I'll have to think about that. Thank you. ",
        "Billy: Tell you what, I'll drive. ",
        "Josh: No, no, I don't think so, because you know what? I don't want to end up \r\nin a ditch like Reva did. ",
        "Billy: Oh, why don't we talk to Shayne about your driving? ",
        "Josh: Okay, that's low. And it's my car. ",
        "Billy: But it's not your car. It's a rental car. And I know the area. ",
        "Josh: Oh, come on. Since when? ",
        "Billy: Since way back. Josh, come on. ",
        "Josh: Since way back when you were drunk, Billy? ",
        "Billy: I know Wichita. I know the roads. You don\u2019t. Just give me... ",
        "Josh: No, you don't! ",
        "Billy: Just give me the keys! ",
        "Woman: Hey! ",
        "Billy: Go get the keys.",
        "Josh: Ok, could you not do that please. It's really... Billy, look at the \r\ncar! Could we not keep the car clean for five minutes? ",
        "Billy: You are not very good at road trips, are you? ",
        "Josh: Oh, yeah, like you are. ",
        "Billy: Uh-huh, I am. They didn't teach you that at that eastern college that \r\nyou went to, did they? ",
        "Josh: You know what? Don't even start with me about colleges, okay, because \r\nyou went to college on a fricking football scholarship, not to mention the fact \r\nyou were always H.B.'s favorite. ",
        "Billy: H.B. didn't play any favorites. ",
        "Josh: Oh, come on, Billy! Do you have any idea what it was like to compete \r\nwith the first son? In fact, I think H.B. liked it when you got into trouble, \r\nbecause it reminded him of him. ",
        "Billy: Oh, come on! You got in trouble all the time, it was just never your \r\nfault, isn't that right? ",
        "Josh: Well, I'm not the one trying to hide a drinking problem. ",
        "Billy: Oh, there we go! Billy drinks, and Billy gets in trouble, and Josh \r\nsaves the day. Well! ( Country radio station playing ) ",
        "Josh: Oh, no, no. ",
        "Billy: Yeah. ",
        "Josh: No, no, no. We're not listening to that. ",
        "Billy ( singing ): \"...To leave me, Lucille.\" ",
        "Josh: No! ",
        "Billy: Hey! ( Singing ): \"...Four hungry children and a crop in the...You \r\nknow what, I'm angry with you; you are angry with me. I consider that to be \r\ncommon ground. ",
        "Josh: No! Okay. ",
        "Billy: What? ",
        "Josh: Okay, okay. Turn on the G.P.S. ",
        "Billy: Why? Is Josh lost? ",
        "Josh: No, I'm not... I'm not lost. I just haven't seen a sign in a while. ",
        "Billy: Oh, well. You should have let me drive. ",
        "Josh: Oh, really? You know where we are? Why don't you tell me right now? \r\nWhere are we, Billy? ",
        "Computer voice: ( Speaking in German ) ",
        "Josh: What the hell is that? ",
        "Billy: I don't know. Do you think she's pretty? ",
        "Josh: Can you switch it to English? ",
        "Computer voice: You missed your exit. ",
        "Josh: What exit. Wait, wait, wait. What exit? ",
        "Computer voice: You missed your exit. ",
        "Josh: Yeah, I know. I heard you. What exit are you talking about? ",
        "Computer voice: Please make a u-turn at the next available intersection. ",
        "Billy: Let's turn it off. ",
        "Josh: No, no, no, no! Leave it on. Just leave it on! ",
        "Computer voice: Please make a u-turn at the next available intersection. ",
        "Billy: Hey, Josh, wait a minute! Look out! ",
        "Josh: What the hell is the matter with you? You scared the daylights out of \r\nme. What, did you see a deer or something? ",
        "Billy: I think you hit a little doe. Hi. ",
        "Candy: Thanks for stopping. I've been waiting for a ride for ages. ",
        "Josh: you made me stop for a hitchhiker? ",
        "Billy: That's right. Hi, I'm Billy. And that stiff over there happens to be \r\nmy little brother. ",
        "Candy: Candy. ",
        "Billy: Candy, hi. What are you doing out here by yourself, darling? ",
        "Candy: Trying to get back to school. Hi. You're a lifesaver. Is there a \r\nproblem? ",
        "Billy: Yeah, there's a problem. My brother is afraid of the law. ",
        "Candy: The law? ",
        "Billy: It happens to be illegal to pick up hitchhikers. Okay, little brother, \r\nif we get picked up, I'll pay the fine, even though I'm not driving. ",
        "Josh: You know what? Shut up, get in the car. ",
        "Candy: Me, too. ",
        "Billy: Yeah. ",
        "Josh: Yeah, whatever. You, too. ",
        "Candy: Oh, I just love you to death right now. ",
        "Billy: I'd say things are picking up, brother. ",
        "Candy: Oh, no. ( Laughing ) ",
        "Billy: It's true. Oh, yeah. Oh, another time, we were out fishing, and he \r\ncaught himself a big ol' trout, and he hauls it in the boat. And then this girl \r\nthat we knew came along... ",
        "Josh: Reva Shayne. ",
        "Billy: Yeah, Reva Shayne. She was the daughter of our housekeeper, she \r\nstarted pleading with Josh, \u201cOh please Josh, let\u2019s throw that little baby fish \r\nback in the water.\" Josh says, \"no, God put the fish here for us to eat.\" So I \r\ngrabbed the fish and threw it in the water. She looks up at me, runs off to the \r\nwoods with me. And I'm telling you, she was grateful I threw that fish back. ",
        "Candy: You're making that up. ",
        "Billy: No, it's true. ",
        "Josh: No, it's all true, except for the part where he ends up with the girl.\r\n",
        "Billy: Wait a minute, wait a minute. She married me before she married you.\r\n",
        "Josh: Billy... ",
        "Candy: You both married the same woman? ",
        "Billy: Oh, well, actually, she married our dad, too. ",
        "Josh: Billy! ",
        "Billy: It's true. I like it. ",
        "Candy: You guys are great. You're so lucky, you two. I didn't have any \r\nbrothers or sisters growing up. I used to dream about having somebody to play \r\nwith, even fight with. ",
        "Josh: Hey, you know what? You want a brother? You can have mine. ",
        "Billy: Now, come on. You wouldn't sell me for nothing. ",
        "Josh: What the hell are you talking about? I tried to sell you to a kid in \r\nthe third grade for a tuna fish sandwich. He said you weren't worth it. ",
        "Candy: You're both so much fun, so nice, too. ",
        "Billy: Yeah. ",
        "Candy: That's why it's such a shame. ",
        "Billy: What's a shame? ",
        "Candy: That I have to rob you. But a girl has got to pay off her credit \r\ncards. ",
        "Josh: You're welcome! What is wrong with you, \u201cMy little brother didn't like \r\nbreaking the law by picking up hitchhikers, so if we get caught, I'll pay for \r\nit.\" ",
        "Billy: Hey, look, I didn't know she was going to go Thelma and Louise on me.\r\n",
        "Josh: She took our belts, Billy, for God's sake. I mean, she took the car, \r\nshe took our shoes, she took our money, and for some reason I can't even fathom, \r\nshe took our belts. ",
        "Billy: Well, maybe it's because you said to her, \"What are you going to do, \r\ntake our belts, too?\" ",
        "Josh: I was being sarcastic. ",
        "Billy: Okay, just calm down. Take a nice, deep breath. We'll get out of this. \r\nWhere are we? ",
        "Josh: What? You're the one who claims to know Wichita. What do you mean? You \r\ntell me where we are. ",
        "Billy: Well, in that case, I'd say we're right out in the middle of damn \r\nnowhere. ",
        "Josh: Oh, great, that's perfect. Thank you for that information. I appreciate \r\nit. ",
        "Billy: Well, hey, you're the one who wanted to take this trip in the first \r\nplace. You could have just said, \"Yes, Billy, I do think you belong at Lewis. \r\nAnd I have missed you.\" ",
        "Josh: Okay, okay. Can we just go, please, in that direction? ",
        "Billy: Wait. No, no, no, no, no. Josh, go in this direction. ",
        "Josh: I think we should go back the direction we came from. Don't you? ",
        "Billy: There was nothing there when we came through, why would we go back?",
        "Josh: I don't care! When I get to town, I'll send the paramedics back for \r\nyou-- that is, if the buzzards have not picked your carcass clean! ",
        "Billy: Just calm down a second. All you've got to do say is, \"Billy, I don't \r\nthink it's a good idea we split up.\" That's it, that's all. Okay, you win. I'll \r\ngo with you, because when we get back to Tulsa, I'm going to be the one that \r\nwins. Ouch! Ouch! ",
        "Josh: Ew. ",
        "Billy: Don't you say a damn word, not one damn word. ",
        "Josh: Could you not walk on top of me? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Are \r\nthose people? ",
        "Billy: Well, I don't think they're snowmen. ",
        "Josh: Hey, how's it going? What are you guys doing here? Is this a bus stop, \r\nby any chance? ",
        "Billy: Hey, I... ( speaking in Spanish ) Me llamo Billy. Mi hermano Josh. ",
        "Man: ( Responds in Spanish ) ",
        "Billy: They\u2019re migrants, waiting for work.",
        "Josh: Okay. Yeah, I figured that out. ",
        "Billy: Oh, how is your Spanish? Pretty good, pretty good? ",
        "Josh: That's funny. That's really funny. ",
        "Billy: I thought so. ",
        "Josh: Okay, look, they're here and we're here. Why don't we just hang out \r\nhere for a while, and maybe a foreman or somebody will show up, and then we can \r\nhitch a ride. ",
        "Billy: Oh, now you're into hitching. ",
        "Josh: Well, it's better than the alternative. ",
        "Billy: I see. Well, you know, I just wonder why it's always about you, isn't \r\nit? Isn't it all about... ",
        "Josh: What? Where did that come from? ",
        "Billy: Now, Josh, you are the one who decides whether I come back to Lewis. \r\nYou're the one who is all going to be shattered if I have a relapse. And you're \r\nthe one that's all hurt because I happen to be friends with Reva. I mean, come \r\non, Josh. If you had been like this when I was a kid, I would have sat on your \r\nhead until your mind was right. ",
        "Josh: Okay, you want to make a decision? You want to decide something, Billy?\r\n",
        "Billy: Yeah, yeah, sure. ",
        "Josh: Really? Okay, go ahead. Decide something. What are we going to do now?\r\n",
        "Billy: We're going to stay here. ",
        "Josh: Uh-huh? ",
        "Billy: But... ",
        "Josh: Ah! \"But... but... but...\" there it is. ",
        "Billy: I was just making a point, Josh. ",
        "Josh: Uh-huh. Okay. ",
        "Billy: Look, I mean, why are you always being the martyr? Why is it poor \r\nJosh. Why didn\u2019t he get told that Reva was sick?",
        "Josh: You know what? That's a really good question. Why didn't Josh get told \r\nthat Reva was sick by his brother? You owed me that, Billy. You owed me at least \r\nthat, no matter how much Reva begged you to keep it from me. You should have put \r\nme first in this case-- me, your brother. I mean, let me ask you this. How would \r\nyou feel if Bill were sick, and I didn't tell you about it? Better yet, how \r\nabout if Bill died, and you didn't have a chance to get to him to say good-bye \r\nbefore he was gone. What would you be thinking then? How would you feel about me \r\nnot telling you? ",
        "Billy: They're gone, Josh. ",
        "Josh: Don't skirt the question! Answer the question! ",
        "Billy: No, no, no! They're gone! Look! And it wasn't an alien ship that took \r\nthem. They're not those kind. ",
        "Josh: Hello? Hola? ",
        "Policeman: Hands up, both of you. You're under arrest. ",
        "",
        "Josh: Hey, come on. Can't you at least tell us why you're arresting us? I \r\nmean, what, for walking around on the road? ",
        "Deputy: Hey, hey, hey! Pipe down or I'll throw the book at you! ",
        "Judge: All right, let's get this show on the road. ",
        "Josh: Thank God. Look, your honor, this is... ",
        "Judge: This is my court. And in my court, you do not speak unless spoken to. \r\nIs that clear? ",
        "Josh: Um... ",
        "Judge: All right, where was I? Case of the \"people versus\"... whoever you \r\nare, complaint number f-6342. ",
        "Deputy: I've got the perps right here, your Honor. ",
        "Josh: Perps? We didn't do anything for work. ",
        "Judge: I beg to differ, we have a law against people hanging out in the \r\nstreets looking for work.",
        "Josh: Oh, see, but that's the thing. We were not looking for work, your \r\nHonor. I mean, I'm Josh Lewis from Lewis Construction, and this is my brother, \r\nBilly Lewis. ",
        "Judge: Do you have a job, brother Billy? ",
        "Billy: Yeah, I was just... ",
        "Josh: Okay, you know what? This is just... this is a big misunderstanding, \r\nokay? We are businessmen from Springfield. I mean, come on, this is... ",
        "Billy: We got robbed. ",
        "Josh: That's right. ",
        "Billy: Our train got stopped, the hail came down, the bus got stopped... ",
        "Josh: That's absolutely the truth. ",
        "Billy: And then we were held up, and everything was taken from us. ",
        "Josh: Even our belts were taken away from us. ",
        "Billy: I don't think he cares about our belts. ",
        "Josh: Well, I think he's going to care when your pants fall down, okay, big \r\nguy? ",
        "Judge: It says here that you were carjacked by a little redhead on her way to \r\ncollege. Took the two of you, did she? ",
        "Josh: She had a gun. ",
        "Judge: I'm sure she did. All right, you two. You sit down and be quiet while \r\nI hear another case. All right, boys, what did you do this time? ",
        "Ned: Larry tried to chop my foot off with a axe. ",
        "Larry: After Ned tried to run me down with his truck. ",
        "Ned: After you shot at me with your pellet gun. ",
        "Larry: After you slept with my woman. ",
        "Ned: She's not your woman! ",
        "Larry: She is, too! ",
        "Judge: All right, all right! You know, you two have been fighting ever since \r\nI've known you-- guns, chainsaws, a homemade bomb. You'd think after 30 or 40 \r\nyears, two brothers would learn to get along. But it's obvious that you two \r\nwon't be satisfied till one of you is dead. You know, if your pappy were here, \r\nhe'd slap some sense into you. Grow the hell up. Bail is denied. Lock 'em up. As \r\nto you two, I'll hear you in the morning. ",
        "Billy: Wait, wait, wait. ",
        "Josh: Wait a second. ",
        "Billy: You're going to lock us up for the night? ",
        "Judge: I can\u2019t. Those two morons took the last cell. I'll have my deputy \r\nhandcuff you to the bench, and he'll bring you some food. ",
        "Josh: Okay, you know what? There is absolutely nothing to keep us from \r\nwalking out that door right now. We'll figure out how to get these off later. \r\nOkay, let's just... hey. How are you doing? Good to see... what? What? ",
        "Billy: The judge offered you the right to remain silent. Why don't you just \r\nuse it? ",

        "Billy: Hey? ",

        "Billy: What? ",
        "Josh: I never said thank you. ",
        "Billy: Thank you? ",
        "Josh: Yeah, for looking after Reva. You were there for her when she needed \r\nyou most. I mean, I know there was a... ",
        "Billy: Whoa, wait a minute. I had an agenda? ",
        "Josh: All right, all right. Forget the agenda thing. This is just a flat-out \r\napology, okay, no strings. ",
        "Billy: Coming from you, that's real big. ",
        "Josh: What was it like, taking care of her? ",
        "Billy: You really want to know? ",
        "Josh: I mean, what the heck? We've got nothing else to talk about. It's going \r\nto be a long night. It must have been hard. ",
        "Billy: Yeah. Yeah, it was real hard. It was hard because we would get hope, \r\nand then we'd lose hope. I'm not going to lie to you, Josh. She was in a lot of \r\npain. She hurt. And it was very hard to watch her just trying to be strong for \r\neverybody, for me. Keep it together. ",
        "Josh: But you made it through, right? ",
        "Billy: Well, the truth is that one day I found myself out in a bar, and I... \r\nI got the bartender to set me up a big ol' bourbon, and I even told him that you \r\nwere the reason that I was drinking it. ",
        "Josh: Oh, nice. So did you take the drink, or what? ",
        "Billy: No. No, I went back and I held Reva\u2019s hand, and I pretended that I was \r\nthe guy who was strong enough to take care of her. But all the while I was \r\nwishing that... ",
        "Josh: Wishing what? ",
        "Billy: Well, that I had somebody who was propping me up, and somebody who \r\nwould make me feel strong-- somebody like my brother. ",
        "Josh: I'm glad that she had one of us to be there for her. And if it couldn't \r\nbe me, I'm glad it was you. Can you tell me some more? I mean, I'd kind of like \r\nto hear everything. ",
        "There's a door descending like my thought in the sunny sky ",

        "Josh: Yeah. ",
        "Billy: So you finally believe us, huh? ",
        "Judge: I do now. My deputy found your I.D.s in her purse. ",
        "Deputy: And your shoes and belts. ",
        "Candy: Hi guys. You look awful. No hard feelings? They were so super nice.\r\n",
        "Judge: Super. You know, I did some checking on you. Why didn't you tell me \r\nthat you're the man behind the H.B. Lewis veteran center? I'm a veteran myself.\r\n",
        "Josh: Great, great. Yeah, H.B. Lewis, he was my... well, actually, he was our \r\nfather. ",
        "Judge: Well, it's fine work you're doing. And here, for the handcuffs. ",

        "Billy: You mean, just like that? After that miserable day we had yesterday, \r\nand the downward spiral, it's all over, just like maybe every day is a chance \r\nfor a fresh start. Here you go. ",
        "Judge: Well, now, come on, you guys. The next plane to Tulsa leaves in 40 \r\nminutes, and I've got a police escort waiting to get you to the airport. ",
        "Billy: That's not going to be necessary. We're not going to fly to Tulsa. ",
        "Josh: What are you talking about? Why not? ",
        "Billy: If you don't want me in the company, I don't want to force my way in.\r\n",
        "Josh: Well, I'll tell you what. Maybe you don't have to force your way in. I \r\ndon't want to go to Oklahoma. I don't want to have issues between us solved by \r\nsome lawyer, okay? I just want to get home. I want to get back to work, with you \r\nby my side. ",

        "Josh: She didn't want me to know. ",
        "Billy: Yeah, but I should have told you anyway. I should have sworn you to \r\nsecrecy, and you could have wheedled it out of her. I mean, I know I was \r\nthinking that I was not telling you out of loyalty to her, but I think a part of \r\nme wanted to keep her all to myself. ",
        "Josh: I knew there was something wrong with her, Billy. I didn't know what it \r\nwas, of course, but I sensed it. And since we're being honest with each other, I \r\nguess I should say, too, that maybe I should have worked harder to figure out \r\nwhat it was, you know, played detective more. I just didn't. ",
        "Billy: You wouldn't have found anything out. ",
        "Josh: Who knows? Maybe I was working so hard on the veterans' project that I \r\njust didn't see what was right in front of me. Maybe I didn't want to see it.\r\n",

        "Billy: Yeah. ",
        "Josh: Well, you know, since we're being honest-- and we are-- I guess I \r\nbetter tell you, then, that that night, after she was with you, she was with me. \r\nAnd she did a whole lot more than just kiss me. ",
        "Billy: Oh, a whole lot more? ",
