        "Reva: Buzz.",
        "Josh: Buzz. I'm glad we may have a chance to catch up with Ross and Blake. It'll be nice to do something fun for a change.",
        "Reva: Yeah, as opposed to being home with Jonathan, which isn't fun at all.",
        "Josh: I didn't say that.",
        "Reva: I know, and you've been a saint. And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.",
        "Josh: Well, you want to get closer to your son. I want what's best for you.",
        "Blake: Rip me all to shreds.",
        "Ross: I think that's low on the list of things bothering you. You've been out of sorts ever since Thanksgiving.",
        "Blake: Well, why wouldn't I be? My mother is not around, and your crazy daughter is.",
        "Reva: I really do hope Marah and Shayne make it home for Christmas. I'd love for them to meet their new brother.",
        "Josh: Yeah, I'm sure they're looking forward to that.",
        "Blake: Let's just have a nice breakfast. No mention of Dinah, all right.",
        "Ross: Mm-hmm. Or Sebastian.",
        "Blake: What about him?",
        "Ross: Nothing, I'm just saying that we're not going to bring him up.",
        "Reva: Hey.",
        "Josh: Hello.",
        "Blake: Hi.",
        "Josh: How are you, Blake?",
        "Blake: So glad we decided to do this.",
        "Reva: Me, too. How are you guys?",
        "Blake: Oh, we're great. And you?",
        "Reva: Oh, couldn't be better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: No, I am not drunk. I am a drunk.",
        "Sebastian: You drank that entire bottle?",
        "Holly: Yes.",
        "Sebastian: How could you do that?",
        "Holly: In one long... (gulping) God grant me the serenity. Now where is the bottle? The bottle. I asked you to bring me a bottle.",
        "Sebastian: And good morning to you too, sunshine.",
        "Holly: There's nothing good about this day. I hate this place, I hate you. And since I'm never going to get out of here, I would like to get stinking drunk, so at least I could have a little pleasure before I die.",
        "Sebastian: You really want to get drunk?",
        "Holly: Wasted.",
        "Sebastian: Okay. Here. I keep this for the pain. Straight vodka. It's the good stuff. You want to destroy your life, Holly? Go for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Well, good. Did you get the fax from Tokyo? All right, just put it on my desk. No, I'm going to be in in a little while. Thanks.",
        "Buzz: Busy man. Sure you have the time?",
        "Gus: For what?",
        "Buzz: To ransack my room again. That's why you're here isn't it?",
        "Gus: No, Buzz, actually I thought maybe I'd take a direct approach. Did you kill Phillip? Because if you did we should deal with it now. May have a pretty good shot at self-defense. He had your grandson; he came to your restaurant with a gun.",
        "Buzz: We don't have a shot at anything, because I'm not saying anything to you.",
        "Gus: Let me ask you something. Do you really think you're helping yourself? You're not. You are making things worse. I'm just trying to help you, Buzz. Talk to me. Tell me what happened that night. Just tell me the truth.",
        "Buzz: Okay. I did it. I killed him. I, colonel mustard, in the observatory with a candlestick.",
        "Alan: You think my son's death is a joke?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Hello to the hardest working brother in the world. I thought you might need a little sugar rush.",
        "Frank: Thank you.",
        "Harley: So what's going on? Any new developments in Phillip's case?",
        "Frank: Ruth Karloff called me last night.",
        "Harley: Really? Was she trying to turn herself in?",
        "Frank: Said she was tired of running, and then she hung up.",
        "Harley: Wow. She's that scared, she must be guilty of something. Don't you think? What?",
        "Frank: Come here.",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Frank: Keep your mouth shut. Don't tell anybody what I'm going to tell you right now. Do you understand me?",
        "Harley: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "Frank: Dad lied.",
        "Harley: Lied about what?",
        "Frank: He lied about his whereabouts the night that Phillip was killed. He was at Company right before the shooting.",
        "Harley: Well, he...",
        "Frank: Remember I told you I was checking out the alarm system at Company? I found out that somebody turned off the alarm right before Phillip was shot. That's why the alarm was never activated. And there was only person who knew that access code. It was Dad.",
        "Harley: Does anybody else know about this?",
        "Frank: No, of course not. But, sis, I've got to file a report.",
        "Harley: No, you don't. Bury it.",
        "Frank: What are you talking about? You know, I can't do that.",
        "Harley: Bury it.",
        "Frank: That didn't take you very long to decide.",
        "Harley: What's to decide? It's a no-brainer.",
        "Frank: A no-brainer? What are you... this information I just gave you, you've already... you already know don't you? You already knew that Dad was at Company that night didn't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: No, no. I'm not going to let you do that to yourself.",
        "Holly: What is this? Some fresh torture?",
        "Sebastian: I just... I just wanted to see how far gone you were.",
        "Holly: Just... just give me a drink and I'll be fine.",
        "Sebastian: Listen to yourself. Think about how you're going to feel about this when you get home.",
        "Holly: (Laughs) Home. I'll get home when you're cured and the streets are paved with chocolate. Then everything will be fine, and we'll just forget about this nasty little incident.",
        "Sebastian: Things were supposed to be different. Holly, you were supposed to be... different. You were supposed to be...",
        "Holly: Perfect? Well, I'm not. And you know, whether you live or die, nothing is ever going to be the same for me, because you have opened up my past. My addictions. Now was that what you planned all along?",
        "Sebastian: No.",
        "Holly: Oh, yes. And now you're freaking out because I chose booze over you, Roger. I picked the wrong addiction.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: I didn't think it was important enough to tell you. I mean, maybe on the surface it seems important, but it's not. Because we both know Dad had nothing to do with Phillip's murder. So why muddy the waters with unnecessary information?",
        "Frank: Is this why you wanted me off the case, because you think Dad did it?",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Frank: Is this misguided way of trying to protect him?",
        "Harley: Dad didn't do it. I don't see any reason to drag him into this. It's obvious somebody planted some evidence against him. Remember what that's like? Having evidence planted against you? Remember what that feels like? If you pursue this, you will ruin his life. And for what? What is the point?",
        "Frank: What do you know that you're not telling me?",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Frank: What are you keeping from me, Harley? Harley? Answer me.",
        "Harley: I'm not keeping anything from you, okay. Stop being so paranoid.",
        "Frank: I'll stop being paranoid when you stop lying to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: I wasn't making fun of your son, Alan, if that's the way it came across.",
        "Alan: Oh, but you're glad he's dead. And admit it. You loathed Phillip and you made his last days on this earth a living hell.",
        "Buzz: No, actually that's what he did to everybody else.",
        "Gus: Dad, why don't you please... just go inside. You know, actually, go get a coffee some place else. This is not helping.",
        "Buzz: What is this... what is this father/son-good cop/bad cop routine? You know, you bait me, he pretends to be my friend? Both of you go someplace else.",
        "Alan: Pretends to be Buzz's friend? Oh, no, no. You're not pretending at all. You're loyal to that man and to his family after all they have done to us.",
        "Gus: Dad, just come on. Let's go. Let's get out of here.",
        "Alan: No, no. You know something, Gus? You are a traitor to your own family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: So Holly's been gone for a while. Did you talk to her over Thanksgiving?",
        "Ross: No, of course not. She's off gallivanting with...",
        "Blake: Yes, actually we did. And she called. She's great.",
        "Ross: She called? The first I've heard about it.",
        "Blake: Well, you were probably tucking the kids in, I guess. I must have forgotten to tell you. But, yes, she's having a great time with Sebastian down in the islands.",
        "Ross: She is, huh?",
        "Blake: Yes, she is.",
        "Reva: You know it's so strange how these relatives just keep popping up.",
        "Josh: Isn't it?",
        "Reva: Roger's son.",
        "Josh: Relatives are popping up all over Springfield these days.",
        "Blake: Oh, that's right. How is it living with Jonathan?",
        "Reva: It's... it's great.",
        "Josh: Great.",
        "Reva: No, actually it's not great. It's not great at all. Jonathan, my newfound son is... well, he's a handful.",
        "Josh: To put it mildly.",
        "Reva: I mean it's complicated. And there is more, if you're interested.",
        "Blake: Well, I'm sure we can match it in the complication.",
        "Josh: Oh, no, no, I wouldn't be so sure of that.",
        "Ross: Well, you're pretty cocky considering what we could bring to the table.",
        "Blake: Dinah.",
        "Ross: Yeah, against whom Blake took out a restraining order. And there's a little matter of Blake's half brother Sebastian. Believe me, the jury's way out of the room still on that guy.",
        "Blake: He has done nothing wrong.",
        "Ross: Not that we know of.",
        "Blake: See?",
        "Ross: So it's pretty much a toss up as to whose life is more complicated.",
        "Reva: (Laughs)",
        "Josh: No. We win.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: You had one slip, Holly. And now it's over.",
        "Holly: It doesn't work that way.",
        "Sebastian: Of course it does. You were under a great deal of stress.",
        "Holly: And I'm not now?",
        "Sebastian: One little slip. You're going to get past this, because you're strong, Holly. And you are beautiful, and you're very, very brave.",
        "Holly: You know there's that's pedestal thing. What have you been expecting from me? Was it really just the need to use me, or was it some salvation?",
        "Sebastian: Drink your coffee.",
        "Holly: Only if it has whiskey in it.",
        "Sebastian: All right, that's it. Come here. Come on, over here. I want you to take a deep breath of that fresh morning air. Come on breathe. Smell it? Do you smell the jasmine? And look. Look, look. See that butterfly? Well, that beauty out there is waiting for you, Holly. It's waiting for both of us. And as soon as we get the cure, we're going to be free. For the first time maybe in our lives, but we're going to be free. You've got to hold on. You can't fall into despair, Holly. I know it's hard. Believe me, I know.",
        "Holly: Oh, would you just cut the garbage. Give me that flask.",
        "Sebastian: Holly. No. Holly. Holly.",
        "Holly: All right.",
        "Sebastian: See you are strong. And that is what is going to get you through this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: So, Jonathan, this is Ross Marler, our mayor.",
        "Ross: Hello, Jonathan.",
        "Reva: And his wife, Blake.",
        "Blake: Hello.",
        "Jonathan: Hello.",
        "Reva: Would you like to join us?",
        "Jonathan: It doesn't look like there's any room.",
        "Reva: Oh, don't be silly. Joshua, grab a chair.",
        "Josh: Sure.",
        "Jonathan: Joshua, do you mind?",
        "Josh: No, not at all. I'll get you a cup of coffee, too.",
        "Reva: And a menu.",
        "Jonathan: No food, no food. I ate before I left the house. Which reminds me, I put some mice in the freezer for Lou.",
        "Blake: Mice?",
        "Jonathan: For my snake, it's a boa constrictor, all four feet of him. And the mice are in baggies. So don't freak out if you see them, okay?",
        "Ross: You feed the snake frozen mice?",
        "Jonathan: No, I nuke them.",
        "Ross: Oh.",
        "Jonathan: In the microwave. He likes them warm and a little on the crispy side. (Phone rings)",
        "Ross: Sorry. That's me. It's about the Board of Ed negotiations. I've got to take it. Excuse me.",
        "Reva: So what are your plans for today?",
        "Jonathan: Is your friend Buzz, okay? He seems kind of upset.",
        "Reva: I should go over and see what's up.",
        "Josh: I'll go with you.",
        "Reva: We'll be right back.",
        "Jonathan: You take your time. So alone at last. You've got to tell me, is there something in the water here in Springfield, because the older women are so hot.",
        "Blake: Older?",
        "Jonathan: It was a compliment.",
        "Blake: You sure about that?",
        "Jonathan: Positive.",
        "Blake: Are you flirting with me?",
        "Jonathan: Would it bother you? I hear you use to be a real wild child back before you started doing the whole suburban mom thing. Now I have a feeling that that crazy little girl is still running around inside just dying to get out.",
        "Alan: Don't you see the Cooper's pushed Phillip over the edge. And no matter what happened in there that night his blood is on your hands. And every time you beg for acceptance from them, you are spitting on your brother's memory.",
        "Gus: Do you hear yourself? Do you hear yourself? The kind of bile you are spewing all over the place. Is this what you want? This is the kind of thing that got Phillip killed in the first place.",
        "Alan: No. I'll tell you what I want?",
        "Gus: You want....",
        "Alan: I want justice.",
        "Gus: Well, then let the cops do their job.",
        "Alan: The cops? Frank Cooper? Son of Buzz Cooper? Brother of Harley? Oh, come on, do you think I can trust Frank Cooper with our lives? Come on. You know that's impossible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Frank, stop sweating the details and focus on the bigger picture, okay. Dad did not kill Phillip. But there are some people in this town who are eager to pin this murder on someone.",
        "Frank: Some people meaning Alan.",
        "Harley: Alan would love it if a Cooper killed Phillip. Because it's not about justice for Alan. It's about revenge.",
        "Frank: I see. So we shouldn't care about justice either.",
        "Harley: We should care about Dad.",
        "Police Officer: Chief?",
        "Frank: What do you got, Dominick?",
        "Police Officer: This just came for you.",
        "Frank: Thank you.",
        "Harley: What is it? What does it say?",
        "Frank: It's from forensics. They just lifted partial prints off the gun that killed Phillip. They're Dad's. This is not going to go away on it's own. Do you understand me?",
        "Harley: This is our father. He's not a murderer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: So what did you do to earn your wild rep, Blake? What kind of naughty things did you do back in the day?",
        "Blake: You're hoping to top me? Dream on, sweetheart.",
        "Jonathan: Hm. I guess that means you don't know.",
        "Blake: Know what?",
        "Jonathan: What I'm capable of.",
        "Blake: Oh, bad things. On a scale of one to ten?",
        "Jonathan: Off the charts, sweetheart.",
        "Buzz: Lizzie Spaulding's my new boss. Isn't the world a crazy place.",
        "Josh: Why did you sell to Phillip?",
        "Buzz: I don't know. Temporary insanity. I thought... I thought... it made sense at the time and then it didn't. Then it was too late because the damage was done. Have you seen our new pink menus?",
        "Josh: Buzz, Buzz, just buy this place back from Lizzie. Billy and I, we'll front you the cash.",
        "Buzz: Well, thank you. I've tried. I've tried, but she won't sell it. I'm just hoping that she'll change her mind when she realizes how much work goes into this place.",
        "Josh: Give her enough room to hang herself, right? That works for me.",
        "Reva: You could just call it, you know, uncle. You got money for the place, right? Do something else with it. I mean, that was the original plan before Phillip died. Stick to it.",
        "Buzz: No hindsight? No regrets?",
        "Reva: Exactly. Go for it.",
        "Buzz: I can't.",
        "Reva: Why not?",
        "Buzz: Something I've got to do first. Excuse me.",
        "Gus: I expect... I'm asking you please just listen to me.",
        "Alan: No, I want you to listen to me for a change.",
        "Buzz: Life is too short.",
        "Alan: What did you say? Life is too short. My son's life was too short Buzz.",
        "Gus: All right. Let me go and talk to him.",
        "Alan: What are you going to go apologize for your father's behavior? Look, if you can't find it in your heart to be loyal to your brother, could you at least be loyal to your father? Come on.",
        "Gus: Please, Dad. Please. Come on.",
        "Alan: You know every time you suck up to them, it's like sticking a knife into me. I feel like I'm losing you bit by bit just like I lost Phillip.",
        "Gus: You're not losing anything. You are my father. You will always be my father. And if you trust me, you will love me and you will know that I will never, never do anything to hurt you. So please, just let me go do what I have to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: No. No. No, that's not possible. No, see... see, Dad was with me when I found the gun. Dad and Coop were there.",
        "Frank: Yeah, and you said no one touched the gun. That's what you said. You said, you were holding a sack of sugar, you were pouring it, the gun came out and no one else touched it until the detectives arrived. That's what you said in your statement.",
        "Harley: Okay, but I wasn't there the whole time, Frank. I left to check on the kids, but Dad was still there. So maybe he picked up the gun, you know?",
        "Frank: Oh, Harley.",
        "Harley: I don't... I don't remember exactly what I said in my statement, okay.",
        "Frank: Harley. Harley.",
        "Harley: I was confused.",
        "Frank: Don't do this. Let me tell you something. You were a cop. No one is going to believe that. This is not going to go away on it's own. Do you understand me?",
        "Harley: This is our father. He's not a murderer.",
        "Frank: You're absolutely right. The same father who took a loaded gun to confront Caroline Caruthers a year ago, and he said he wouldn't hesitate to use it.",
        "Harley: Frank, listen to me. You don't believe this. You don't honestly believe that Dad would do this.",
        "Frank: That's why I need to keep going after him gathering evidence. So I can take him off the suspect list.",
        "Harley: The man just had a heart attack, okay? Do you forget what he looked like lying in that hospital bed hooked up to all those tubes and wires? Do you want to see that happen again? Because that's exactly what will happen if you pursue this, if you make him go to trial or, God forbid, jail.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: What happened to you doesn't change who you are. Before I brought you here, you had a great life, didn't you?",
        "Holly: You tell me.",
        "Sebastian: You have people who love you. Chrissy and Meg and Ross and all of your friends.",
        "Holly: They get on without me. My life... my life is a constant struggle, Sebastian. I fake it well, but I'm just barely holding on. And now I'm not.",
        "Sebastian: I can help you. You can beat this. And you know what? When we get home ???",
        "Holly: So you wouldn't tell Blake or Ross or anybody about this?",
        "Sebastian: No. No one. Never.",
        "Holly: Well, maybe we have something to discuss. Why don't you sit down? Why don't you pour us both some coffee?",
        "Sebastian: Give it to me, Holly. Not the box. The remote. Hand it over.",
        "Holly: What remote? Did you misplace it?",
        "Sebastian: You took it from me when you went for my flask.",
        "Holly: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Sebastian: You want us both locked in here together?",
        "Holly: Well, then you won't have to die alone.",
        "Sebastian: Stop. Stop playing with me. This is not a game. (Groans)",
        "Holly: Looks like the grim reaper is a little closer than we thought?",
        "Sebastian: (Groaning)",
        "Holly: What do you need?",
        "Sebastian: (Groaning)",
        "Holly: Do you want some water? Wait. Here. Can you hold it? Here, take it. You need me to...",
        "Sebastian: Now, that's the Holly I know and love. Not that lying, selfish woman who's been playing me. What did you do with the wine last night, Holly? Huh? Did you pour it down the sink?",
        "Holly: Down my throat.",
        "Sebastian: No, no. You have been stone cold sober all this time, but you had hoped that I would think otherwise. That way you could shame me into releasing you.",
        "Holly: To shame somebody they have to have a conscience, Sebastian.",
        "Sebastian: You took advantage of my feelings for you and you say that I'm unconscionable? Well?",
        "Holly: Well, what?",
        "Sebastian: The remote.",
        "Holly: You lost it and you blame me? How are we going to get out of here?",
        "Sebastian: Don't make me hurt you, Holly.",
        "Holly: Oh, I know. The radio. The radio.",
        "Sebastian: Holly...",
        "Holly: We'll call. We will call out for help.",
        "Sebastian: Holly, it only works one way, remember?",
        "Holly: Well, then we'll use yours.",
        "Sebastian: I left it in Springfield.",
        "Holly: Oh, you did desert me, then.",
        "Sebastian: Accidentally. I lost it. Now, are you still going to pretend that you don't have the remote? Fine. Then I guess we're just going to sit here until we turn to dust.",

        "Blake: Does your mother know how fresh you are?",
        "Jonathan: Are you going to tell her?",
        "Blake: Well, with me, you never know what I'm going to do.",
        "Jonathan: Same here.",
        "Blake: So, if you want to say something to me, why don't you say it?",
        "Jonathan: Me? I just... I can't wait to see you. And I've got to hit the head.",
        "Ross: (Clears throat) Alan. What are you doing here? I mean... well you know what I mean. Phillip and everything.",
        "Alan: Yeah, exactly. Well, Ross, this was the last place that Phillip was conscious and I guess I feel closer to him in some way.",
        "Josh: Alan, I just wanted to extend condolences for both myself and Reva. I'm sorry that we couldn't be at the funeral, but our thoughts were with you.",
        "Alan: Thank you, Josh.",
        "Josh: I can't imagine what it would be like to lose a child.",
        "Alan: Be very grateful. Because you find yourself reliving their entire life, thinking of thousands of ways that you might have prevented this tragedy. Things you could have done should have done.",
        "Ross: I felt the same way about Dinah at times, but it's hopeless. You can't change the past, you know?",
        "Alan: No. No, you can't.",
        "Blake: Hey, listen. Thanks for the breakfast. That was fun, but I think we have to take off now.",
        "Reva: Oh. Well, I saw you and Jonathan talking together. It seemed like you got along. What were you talking about?",
        "Blake: Oh, snakes devouring crispy mice.",
        "Reva: (Laughs) Yeah, well, I know he comes on kind of strong.",
        "Blake: Kind of?",
        "Reva: Did he say something to upset you?",
        "Blake: Just got a little personal, that's all. That's okay. I can handle it. See you.",

        "Reva: Outside.",
        "Jonathan: Whoa.",

        "Jonathan: Did she say that I did?",
        "Reva: I'm asking you.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, I was just making small talk with her, and if she can't handle that, it's her problem.",
        "Reva: No, it's our problem. I think you were looking to cause trouble from the moment you sat down with us in there. Mice in the microwave? Please.",
        "Jonathan: That's me. I was just talking about the things that I like to talk about.",
        "Reva: Right.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, I didn't learn how to say the perfect thing at the perfect time when I was growing up, because I was too busy learning how to dodge punches.",
        "Reva: Wah, wah, wah. So now you hit first, is that it? Do you know why you do that, Jonathan?",
        "Jonathan: Well, a shrink would probably say that it's a defensive mechanism I've developed to avoid intimacy, which I equate with pain and rejection. But I think it's just pretty good fun.",
        "Reva: Big, bad Jonathan. You talk so tough. But I think when push comes to shove you don't have real guts.",
        "Jonathan: Try me.",

        "Buzz: It's my... it's the first dollar I ever made at Company. Don't you remember? You and Harley had it framed for me. I'm just taking an old friend's advice and letting go of what's already gone. What are you doing here?",
        "Frank: I've got to take you down to the station, pop.",

        "Frank: Yeah, I remember.",
        "Buzz: Deenie used to believe in mind over matter. She thought if you wished something enough, it would come true. So she'd put on her bathing suit and plunge in, telling herself it was August and sweltering.",
        "Frank: Yeah, that... that was Mom.",
        "Buzz: She never was much on reality. Can't say as I blame her. Oh, don't look so guilty. You're just doing your job.",

        "Blake: (Sighs) Yes. Yes, I saw him briefly.",
        "Ross: Why didn't you tell me?",

I mean, do you want this? I mean I'll be there with you, 200% to support you. In fact, I'd like to give him an earful myself. Do you want to get to know each other? Do you want to have a shot at a relationship? Because if you do, then this is what you need to do.",

That is my father we're talking about, and he is a kind, decent, wonderful man. He doesn't deserve this. Daddy. Daddy. I'm so sorry about all this. I am going to get you out of this, I promise.",
