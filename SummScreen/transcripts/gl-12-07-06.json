        "Dinah: Oh honey you are, I'm kidding, come on. Admit it, you know you can't get enough of me.",
        "Mallet: Well, that's kind of true. I was wondering if you sticking so close to me lately doesn't have anything to do with maybe me being in competition with you over that last spot on the TV schedule?",
        "Dinah: You are something else. You are so cynical. Why don't you try trusting me for once?",
        "Mallet: Trust, right, right. Like you?",

        "Dinah: No. No, not today. I'm going to let the big man handle that. You know, I don't want to steal that spotlight from him. I need to focus on getting my own show clicking. \"Light On Springfield,\" check your local listings.",

        "Harley: Well, were any of them ugly?",
        "Gus: What do you mean? Something that could mess us up? No. No. What is the matter with you? You want it to be a big mystery? Your life is boring? You want to amp it up? What, you want to go on the run again? You want to be on the lamb?",

        "Dinah: That's right, 'cause you're filling out forms.",
        "Mallet: Except for that part, if you remember correctly, where I almost got shot or that part where I almost died in a fire. That's pretty exciting stuff. I mean, it's not gossip exciting, but it is exciting.",
        "Dinah: Gossip. Well, I don't do gossip. I do infotainment. \"Light On Springfield\" is the name of the show.",
        "Mallet: Honey, thank you so much for stopping by.",

        "Jeffrey: I don't think so.",
        "Buzz: Jeffrey, I know where you are. I know what it's like to wake up and find out you have a child you didn't know you had and she's all grown up. You missed everything.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you know what? We'll have to share a beer and have a good cry some time. But until then...",
        "Buzz: Hey, Ava doesn't deserve this. Think about it. She's got her life together. You pulled the rug out from under her. She's on her butt, she doesn't know who she is. She finds out she has two parents that are pretty complicated people. She needs time to recover.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I'm not part of Ava's life-- not now, not ever. I made that clear to Olivia.",
        "Buzz: You're right. Ava isn't my business, but Olivia on the other hand...",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, \"Stay away from my girlfriend\"? Is that what this is?",
        "Buzz: There's no point to you lurking around here. You have no jobs, you have no prospects, and all you remind her of is something she wants to forget, okay? So pick up your things and move on. Learn from mistakes and start fresh.",
        "Jeffrey: Buzz, you should stick to making coffee, because you make a lousy life coach.",
        "Buzz: I don't really care what you do with your life, just do it somewhere else.",
        "Jeffrey: You can tell Olivia I'm sorry that we have to share the same planet.",
        "Buzz: Sharing the planet is not the problem. Sharing this town is. Stay the hell away from her. You get that?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, I get it, Buzz, but I can't make that promise.",

        "Ashlee: I came up with that slogan.",
        "Dinah: Well, it doesn't look half bad. It's quite clever, but too bad it's gonna tank, you might need a job pretty soon.",
        "Ashlee: But it's a hit.",
        "Dinah: \"Light On Springfield,\" is going to bump that hit.",
        "Ashlee: Gossip, right?",
        "Dinah: Infotainment!",
        "Ashlee: Oh, cool. Well, maybe you could use me. I could work for you. Someone to help out?",

        "Dinah: Someone like you?",
        "Ashlee: Well, yeah, I have loads of experience.",
        "Dinah: Okay. Like what?",
        "Ashlee: Well, I helped Blake Marler for one.",
        "Dinah: Let me tell you something sweetie, okay? \"Springfield Burns\" that on your resume, that's a dealbreaker for most people in this town.",
        "Ashlee: Including you?",
        "Dinah: I haven't decided yet.",
        "Ashlee: You don't have anything to put on the air, do you? You need me.",
        "Dinah: Oh, stop suggesting I'm that desperate.",
        "Ashlee: Or that jealous.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: So I want to ask you, this show that Dinah's working on, you don't think it really stands a chance up against our show, do you? I mean, I would be very happy, you know, if her show blew up and became a big success.",
        "Mia: Well, yes, she's a great personality. The cameras love her.",
        "Marina: No one told me there was going to be a camera crew here today. Hey, boss. Looking good. A.C. Mallet is \"The Law.",

        "Mallet: Please, tell me... just please tell me someone got killed.",
        "Marina: What?",
        "Mallet: No, I mean... I didn't mean it like that. I didn't... what I'm trying to say is please tell me that you've got a case. Any case, anything will do, like a robbery or a homicide, that would be really nice.",
        "Marina: Now see, most cops like it when there is not crime.",
        "Mallet: I do, I do like that. But I've got a reality show and there's no frickin' crime in this town today.",
        "Marina: Oh, don't you hate it when we do our job. So this crew, they're going to follow us around on our shift, no matter what we do, where we go, it will end up on the show?",
        "Mallet: Yeah. Do you have a problem with that, Detective Cooper? Because the thing is, being my partner, you kind of end up being a character on my show.",
        "Marina: Your show?",
        "Mallet: You might be a little nervous, but just act natural. And remember we are tough, gritty, working class cops just doing what we do.",
        "Marina: I can totally do that. It's perfectly normal. Hey, partner.",
        "Mallet: Hey.",
        "Marina: So you catch any cases yet?",
        "Mallet: No, no, not yet.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: You know, I know what it is like to try to live down a mistake. Do you know what it takes to do that?",
        "Jeffrey: I think you're going to tell me.",
        "Buzz: It takes sacrifice. The cleansing fire of sacrifice. You know what sacrifice you're going to have to make? Now, today, you're going to go over to Olivia's hotel, and you're going to move out and find another place to live.",
        "Jeffrey: It's not gonna happen.",
        "Buzz: You might want to rethink that.",
        "Jeffrey: You know, you Springfield people are starting to piss me off. Keep your pie.",
        "Buzz: It's cake, and the feeling is mutual.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, yeah. Buzz, you're getting lucky with a pretty lady, and now you're trying to get all tough with her.",
        "Buzz: You know, when you were young, you made a mistake, you did something really, really awful. But you're a man now and you're going to have to face it like a man.",
        "Jeffrey: Keep your threats and take whatever medication you might need and get out of my face.",
        "Buzz: Medication? What kind of crack is that, medication?",
        "Jeffrey: You have a weak ticker, Buzz, and you're fragile.",
        "Buzz: You sure about that?",
        "Jeffrey: I have lived with what I did for long enough. I don't want to carry that burden anymore. All I want is some peace and maybe just a little bit of forgiveness if that's possible in this lifetime. And you know what I realized? Olivia is the key to all of that for me. Olivia is my way out of hell. Your salvation is not my problem, and it's not Olivia's.",
