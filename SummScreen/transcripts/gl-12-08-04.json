        "Frank: All right, pop, go on in. Listen, Barton is going to be in to question you, okay?",
        "Buzz: You're not going to do this, Frank?",
        "Frank: I don't think it's a good idea.",
        "Buzz: You've got a job, Frank. Do it.",
        "Frank: That's exactly what I'm doing. Whoever questions you about Phillip's murder, Dad, needs to be objective.",
        "Buzz: I think you're capable of that.",
        "Frank: I'm not so sure.",
        "Gus: \"You know what you have to do?\" What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Harley: It just means I'll do whatever I have to, to help my father.",
        "Gus: Well, the good kind of help or the bad kind of help?",
        "Harley: What difference does it make?",
        "Gus: The difference is, I don't want you doing something reckless. You get it?",
        "Frank: You okay?",
        "Harley: Who are you asking that to? Don't you think you should be asking that to the man in the room with the weak heart?",
        "Frank: Exactly what do you want me to do, Harley? Ignore the evidence that my father's fingerprints were all over the murder weapon?",
        "Harley: Well, then find some new evidence. Or better yet, why don't you find the killer? Because if you don't I will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: When did this happen? Do you have any idea what prompted this? Well, let me know when you find out. So, Buzz Cooper was dragged into the police station by his own son, huh? (Chuckles) How poetic. Listen, call me when he's formally arrested, will you?",
        "Alexandra: Alan! Alan, Buzz Cooper is innocent. He did not kill Phillip.",
        "Alan: Listen, I have to go. Will you please calm down?",
        "Alexandra: Well, not until you tell me what you're up to.",
        "Alan: I am not up to anything. I am merely keeping abreast of what's going on in the investigation, that's all.",
        "Alexandra: Really? Then why... why Buzz? Why was he called in? Why?",
        "Alan: I don't know.",
        "Alexandra: Well, then you call whoever you were talking to right back and find out.",
        "Alan: I don't have to. They're going to call me back. But I don't want you to worry at all about your precious little Buzz. He hasn't been charged yet.",
        "Alexandra: Well, he's not going to be, because I'm going down there right now.",
        "Alan: Oh, no, you're not. No, you're not. You're staying right here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mel: I hate this.",
        "Rick: Me too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: (Echoing): The pool could be a way out. Right? It is a risk I have to take if I want to save you. I do. Listen to me. I will be back, okay? I promise you. I promise you that won't be the last kiss. Okay? I will be back. Okay?",
        "Tony: (Gasping)",
        "Michelle: Hold on, Tony. I'm going to get you out of there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: Holly? Holly? Help me. (Groaning) help me. Please. Please help me.",

        "Marina: Hi.",
        "Danny: Hey.",
        "Marina: Marina Cooper, nanny to the stars, reporting for service, sir.",
        "Danny: Yeah, well, I left you a message. I guess you didn't get it.",
        "Marina: Did you make your voice sound like an old Chinese woman?",
        "Danny: (Laughs) no.",
        "Marina: Then the only message I got was a wrong number. What's up?",
        "Danny: Well, I'm sorry, but I forgot that Robbie's got a fieldtrip today with his nursery school.",
        "Marina: Oh. So, I guess my nanny super-powers are rendered useless.",
        "Danny: Yeah, kind of. But, you know, since I didn't get a hold of you in time, I'm going to pay you for the day.",
        "Marina: Are you kidding me? No. No. Please.",
        "Danny: Hey. No, no, no. I am not a deadbeat. But you know, this does mean that you're on the clock for the rest of the afternoon.",
        "Marina: Kind of hard to nanny without a kid around.",
        "Danny: Oh, actually it's very easy, and since I am paying you for your time, I was thinking maybe I could put your services to other use?",
        "Marina: Now, this is starting to sound like something that's illegal in most states.",
        "Danny: Well, that's not what I mean. I was thinking maybe you could help me out at the lighthouse.",
        "Marina: (Laughs) Yeah, right.",
        "Danny: No? Okay, maybe not.",
        "Marina: No.",
        "Danny: That's all right.",
        "Marina: But I do have some thoughts about how I could work off my time.",
        "Danny: Okay, all right. What do you want to do?",
        "Marina: Something really dirty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mel: We agreed never to go to bed angry.",
        "Rick: I wouldn't say that we were angry.",
        "Mel: Well, we weren't saying anything.",
        "Rick: That's because I didn't know what to say, honey.",
        "Mel: I didn't know what to say, either. Look, I know you don't see things the way I do. How could you?",
        "Rick: You know, I'm trying, honey. I really am. I mean, part of me was mad at Phillip for what he did, but the other part of me--his best friend--knows that he was ill and he needed help.",
        "Mel: Okay, we're not going to agree on this. There's just no way around that.",
        "Rick: You know you never held a grudge in the past against anybody. Why are you doing it now?",
        "Mel: I'm not holding a grudge.",
        "Rick: Yes, you are.",
        "Mel: I am not holding a grudge. I just don't like what Phillip did to you. He wasn't acting like a friend in any way when he took your son. Okay, I don't know how you can just erase that nightmare from your memory, just because it's Phillip.",
        "Rick: As a doctor, you should know that he was not well.",
        "Mel: I am not looking at it as a doctor. Okay? I am looking at it as your wife and a mother.",
        "Rick: See, I appreciate that, I really do, but it's not that cut-and-dry. It's not.",
        "Mel: Yes, it is.",
        "Rick: No, it's not.",
        "Mel: Yes, it is. I don't want to argue. I just think that we have different perspectives.",
        "Rick: Well, exactly, because he's my best friend.",
        "Mel: He stole your son, Rick. Not to mention all the other terrible things that's gone on between you two through the years.",
        "Rick: Well, you know what? I did some horrible things to him, too. Some really bad things, but you know what? You stick by your friend through the good and bad of everything. You help him.",
        "Mel: Yeah. Yeah, you help your friends. Phillip was beyond help, okay? There's nothing you could have done. You know what? We disagree. Married people do that.",
        "Rick: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Mel: Why don't we just agree to disagree and let's move past this.",
        "Rick: Do you really think it's going to be that easy, Mel?",
        "Mel: No, I don't think it's going to be easy. Okay? I think it's going to be a challenge. (Cell phone rings) It's Cedars. I can call them back.",
        "Rick: No, no. Go. Take it.",
        "Mel: Dr. Bauer.",
        "Beth: Hey. The hospital told me I could find you here. I hope you don't mind me crashing your lunch.",
        "Rick: What are you doing here? What's up with you? What are you doing?",
        "Beth: Look what I found. (Laughs)",
        "Rick: That's our yearbook.",
        "Beth: I know. It seems a little silly, two grown adults looking at their high school yearbook, but I just found a fun picture.",
        "Rick: Hey, Beth. Actually, you know what? Listen, actually, this is not a real good time.",
        "Beth: Wait. Wait until you see this picture. It's just so great. (Laughs) Oh, hey, Mel. I was just showing Rick a fun picture of Phillip.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Oh, that's that. The end of an era, you know, the funny thing is, if it would have made a difference, I would have taken the risk. I would have stood up there with nothing but a hose between me and the fires around us. I would have gone to hell and back to make things right. I mean, if all it took was a little water, a big heart and lots of desire. Hell, I could have been here, because the heart and desire, that I got. But where is the stuff that puts out all the fires in my life? All the answers to the questions rattle around in my brain and drive me crazy. Where's that big answer? Where's that big answer that wipes the slate clean and changes everything? (Knocking on door)",
        "Frank: Pop?",
        "Buzz: Taking a walk down memory lane, trying to figure out how I ended up here. Where's the other guy?",
        "Frank: I gave him another assignment.",
        "Buzz: You're questioning me yourself, Frank?",
        "Frank: Like you said, Dad, I can be objective, right? (Knock on door)",
        "Gus: Okay, I'm here.",
        "Buzz: What's he doing here?",
        "Gus: I'm your lawyer.",
        "Buzz: I don't need a lawyer.",
        "Frank: It was my idea, Dad.",
        "Buzz: So you got me the Spaulding attorney? Thanks, Frank.",
        "Frank: Thanks for coming.",
        "Gus: Mm-hmm. Buzz, you're being questioned in a murder investigation. You need somebody in your corner, all right?",
        "Buzz: And that would be you? What is this?",
        "Frank: What it is, is that he wants to help. And since I'm sticking my neck out here, we need to be extra careful. Can we get started, please?",
        "Gus: Before you do, Frank, hold on a second.",
        "Frank: Before... what are you talking about? I haven't even asked any questions yet.",
        "Gus: Are you prepared to charge my client?",
        "Buzz: I'm not your client.",
        "Gus: Because if you're not prepared to charge him...",
        "Buzz: I'm not your...",
        "Frank: Hold on a second. Look...",
        "Buzz: That implies a monetary relationship.",
        "Frank: Excuse me. Excuse me.",
        "Gus: What?",
        "Frank: I asked you to be here and I want you to be here, but I'm going to ask him the questions I need to ask him. Are we clear on that?",
        "Gus: Yeah. But are we clear that he's only going to answer the questions he needs to answer?",
        "Frank: Fine.",
        "Gus: Fine.",
        "Frank: All right, pop. Listen. The night that Phillip was killed, we know that the alarm was turned off before Phillip got there. You're the only one that knows the access code.",
        "Buzz: That's right.",
        "Frank: Okay. Did you turn off the alarm?",
        "Buzz: Yes, I did.",
        "Frank: Okay, why? At exactly what time did you come back to Company that night?",
        "Buzz: I'm not sure.",
        "Frank: All right, we'll talk about Phillip's fingerprints on the gun. There were two clean sets of prints lifted off that gun: Yours and his. Why were yours on it?",
        "Gus: Don't answer that question.",
        "Buzz: Because I touched the gun, Frank.",
        "Frank: When did you touch the gun?",
        "Gus: I'm advising you not to answer that question.",
        "Buzz: I'll answer the question.",
        "Gus: I want you to keep your mouth shut, Buzz. Please.",
        "Buzz: Okay. The answer is, I don't know.",
        "Frank: Okay, fine. Forget about the gun. Let's talk about your recent dealings with Phillip. What were they?",
        "Buzz: Well, let's see. He closed down my restaurant. He flattened my daughter's house. And he kidnapped my grandchildren. What do you want to know, Frank?",
        "Frank: When was the last time you saw him?",
        "Buzz: The night he was killed.",
        "Frank: What time was that, Dad?",
        "Buzz: I'm not sure exactly, Frank.",
        "Frank: What did you guys talk about?",
        "Buzz: Um, I told him I'd had enough, that he'd taken enough away from my family and that it had to come to an end.",
        "Frank: Did you threaten him, Dad?",
        "Buzz: (Laughs) What do you think?",
        "Frank: Dad, did you threaten him with the gun?",
        "Gus: He's not answering that question.",
        "Buzz: The whole town knew how I felt about Phillip! I hated the man! You want to know what I did the last time I saw him, Frank?!",
        "Gus: We need a minute alone, please! Can you give us a minute alone? Please, Frank.",
        "Frank: Fine.",
        "Gus: What are you doing?",

        "Alexandra: Alan, I am going down to that police station and I don't care what you say.",
        "Alan: No, you are not. You're not going to go down there and make another mistake by putting your foot in your mouth, just like you've been doing a lot these days.",
        "Alexandra: Well, you wouldn't know this, but helping a friend is not making a mistake.",
        "Alan: Even at the expense of your own family? I need justice, Alexandra.",
        "Alexandra: I need... I need justice, too. I loved that boy every bit as much as you do, but Buzz Cooper did not kill Phillip.",
        "Alan: How can you be so certain?",
        "Alexandra: I just know. You know the man.",
        "Alan: Yes, I know the man hated Phillip. And I think you know more than you are letting on, Alexandra.",
        "Alexandra: (Laughs) Oh, really.",
        "Alan: Now, what's going on between you and Buzz, anyway? I remember when I went down to the station to inform you you were released; you and Buzz were talking about some kind of arrangement.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, come on. We were catching up, for heaven's sakes. I needed to apologize to Buzz for all of the horrible things this family has done to his.",
        "Alan: You're going to have to do better than that.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, come on, Alan. You're really wasting my time. You know, Buzz is innocent. That's all you need to know. Now, just let me go. All right? I made a promise and I am going to keep it.",
        "Alan: Wait a minute. What... wait a minute. Promise? What kind of promise?",
        "Alexandra: It doesn't matter!",
        "Alan: You and he have some kind of deal, don't you?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, what kind of deal could we possibly have? Buzz is innocent, that's all you have to know. Will you, for heaven's sakes, just trust me?",
        "Alan: Trust you?",
        "Alexandra: Is that so unfathomable?",
        "Alan: Yes, it is. And don't you think for one minute that Buzz Cooper trusts you.",
        "Alexandra: Well, he does.",
        "Alan: Oh, really? After all that ugly business between Harley and Gus, he's probably selling you down the river as we speak.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, really? If you're trying to shake up my resolve, just forget it, because I will not abandon Buzz.",
        "Alan: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, just come with me and you'll find out.",

        "Gus: You want to tell me what the hell you're doing?",
        "Buzz: Having some coffee. You want some?",
        "Gus: No, you know what I'm talking about.",
        "Buzz: I'm here to answer questions, that's what I'm doing. But you keep stopping me.",
        "Gus: Yeah, well, there's a reason for that. Because you don't tell the police that you threatened the victim, that you hated the victim.",
        "Buzz: Frank already knew that.",
        "Gus: Yeah, but this is different. This is for the record, Buzz. You've got to be smart about the way you answer these questions.",
        "Buzz: Why are you doing this?",
        "Gus: I'm trying to help you, okay? I'm trying to help your family, and I'm sorry, I cannot bring myself to believe that you killed Phillip. Even though you hated him, you're not a killer.",
        "Buzz: You think you know me?",
        "Gus: Yes.",
        "Buzz: I'm Harley's father, Marina's grandfather, and owner of a restaurant.",
        "Gus: Is there more?",
        "Buzz: Yes. There are things you don't know.",
        "Gus: What, that you've killed before?",
        "Buzz: Ah.",
        "Gus: Well, that was a long time ago wasn't it Buzz? And it was the war and it was different.",
        "Buzz: ???",
        "Gus: There is a reason that you don't want me anywhere near this case and I'm going to find out what it is.",

        "Marco: Si. This can be a dangerous place. What are you doing out here?",
        "Michelle: I know. My friend took a fall and I climbed down to try to help him, and now... we got trapped.",
        "Marco: Trapped?",
        "Michelle: Yes. Yes. And my friend can't get out now and he's really, really sick.",

        "Marco: What's wrong with him?",
        "Michelle: I think he got bitten by an insect, or, like, maybe a spider.",
        "Marco: I see.",
        "Michelle: Do you live near here, or is there a town nearby?",
        "Marco: No.",

        "Marco: How far down is your friend?",
        "Michelle: I don't know. I don't know, maybe 30 feet? 40? I'm not sure.",
        "Marco: Okay, okay. We have to climb down.",
        "Michelle: Yes.",
        "Marco: We need some rope, other equipment. You say your friend is unable to move?",
        "Michelle: No, he's going to have to be carried out.",
        "Marco: Okay, you and I won't be able to move him.",
        "Michelle: Well, we might. We could try.",
        "Marco: No, no, no. We need more manpower.",
        "Michelle: Okay. Is there a town nearby or something, because we have to do this fast. He doesn't have much time. He's getting really sick.",

        "Marco: I find you. If you want help, we do it my way.",
        "Michelle: Okay, but your way doesn't make any sense.",
        "Marco: Oh, yeah. Believe me, I can move a lot more quickly on my own. Take it or leave.",

        "Marina: Well, you will be when I pack the nastiest spit-aided ice ball ever to drill you in the ear.",
        "Danny: Oh, yeah? That's some serious snow trash talk I'm hearing from you.",
        "Marina: Yeah, well, I'm just getting warmed up. You better be careful or I'll show you the sinker that Shayne taught me when... Yeah? Wow.",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Marina: I didn't even see that memory coming.",
        "Danny: Oh, come on. Who cares? I'm not offended that you brought up his name. I am offended that you're such an easy target. Boom.",
        "Marina: You're a dead man!",
        "Danny: Boom. (Laughter) None of that. I've got to warn you: I grew up chucking these babies at cop cars.",
        "Marina: Oh, nice.",

        "Rick: It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. I tried. It didn't work. It didn't work.",
        "Beth: Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset Mel. I know that her feelings about Phillip are very strong.",
        "Rick: So are mine.",
        "Beth: But we knew a different Phillip, the real Phillip.",
        "Rick: See, but she knows that Phillip, too, Beth.",
        "Beth: I know, I know. But it's not the same.",
        "Rick: Yeah, I guess you're right.",
        "Beth: You know what you should do? You should go after her and you should talk to her.",
        "Rick: You know what I want to do? I want to look at this yearbook. I want to go through every single page of this silly yearbook.",
        "Beth: Are you sure?",
        "Rick: Absolutely.",
        "Beth: (Laughs)",
        "Rick: What is it?",
        "Beth: All of a sudden, I feel a little conspicuous, you know? Everybody we know comes here and they're going to look at us like...",
        "Rick: Like what? The two pathetic grieving people that we are?",
        "Beth: Exactly. You know, James is missing his Uncle Rick. We could go by the house. I mean, if you have time.",
        "Rick: I have time. Let's go.",
        "Beth: Okay.",

        "Gus: You're protecting somebody, Buzz.",
        "Buzz: I'm just answering Frank's questions.",
        "Gus: Yeah, but you're making yourself look guilty, here.",
        "Buzz: Thank you for the help. Frank!",
        "Frank: Okay, can we proceed now?",
        "Gus: Sure, why not? Nobody cares what I think.",
        "Buzz: Well, the truth comes out, you know? It always does. Let's get this over with.",
        "Frank: Fine. I'll get straight to the point. Dad, did you kill Phillip?",
        "Gus: You know what? I'm not going to let you be stupid, okay? You want to tell the truth, that's great, but you're not going to confess to a murder. You've got a family, Buzz. A family, people who care about you. Harley cares about you. Even Frank here supposedly cares about you, so you're going to shut up. I am telling you to shut your mouth. And Frank, don't ask that question again, okay? Do not do this to your father.",
        "Frank: Okay, you know, Gus...",
        "Gus: You want to ask him something? Ask him about the fingerprints.",
        "Frank: Okay, what about the fingerprints?",
        "Gus: It doesn't matter that his fingerprints are on the gun, okay? It doesn't mean that he pulled the trigger. Maybe he walked into Company and found the gun and he put it up on the counter. Or he put it away because he was nervous or something, Frank.",
        "Frank: Okay, you know what? Fine. Then let my Dad say that. Is that what happened?",
        "Gus: You know what? If you think your father is a murderer, then arrest him. If not, let him go.",
        "Frank: Okay, I'll let him go when I get some answers.",
        "Buzz: Frank, listen to what I'm saying. Phillip got what he deserved.",
        "Frank: Did you do it, Pop? Did you give it to him?",
        "Gus: All right, this interview is over. It's over.",
        "Frank: Dad, did you kill Phillip?",
        "Alexandra: No, he did not kill Phillip. For heaven's sakes, he's innocent. Let him go.",
        "Buzz: Oh, for the love of Mike!",
        "Gus: Alexandra, what are you doing here?",
        "Frank: You know that's a really good question. Exactly what are you doing here, Alexandra? Huh? Because if you're so sure that my father is innocent and he didn't do it, then you must know who did.",
        "Frank: So, Alex, what exactly do you know about Phillip's shooting?",
        "Alexandra: I know that your father did not do it.",
        "Buzz: She doesn't know anything, Frank.",
        "Alan: My sister has a flair for the dramatic. I apologize for her rude interruption, gentlemen. Now, if you will come with me, Alexandra.",
        "Frank: No, actually, I need her to stay with me.",
        "Alan: She has nothing to contribute, Frank.",
        "Frank: Why don't you let her speak for herself?",
        "Alexandra: All right. All right, Frank. I don't know who killed Phillip, but I know that your father did not.",
        "Frank: Yeah. Well, you keep saying that. Can you be a little bit more specific?",
        "Alexandra: Because he was nowhere near Company that night.",
        "Frank: Now, how do you know that?",
        "Alexandra: Because he was with me.",
        "Frank: He was with you. Oh. Well, you were in jail, right, so there'd be a record of that.",
        "Alexandra: All right, that's just it, Frank. I was not in jail.",
        "Alan: Alexandra, this is preposterous.",
        "Frank: Can it, Alan. Explain yourself.",
        "Alexandra: I bribed a guard.",
        "Gus: Great.",
        "Frank: You bribed a guard? So he let you slip out of prison.",
        "Alexandra: All right. Come on, Frank. I had had day passes before. This one was just off-the-books.",
        "Buzz: Alex.",
        "Alexandra: No, no.",
        "Buzz: Leave it.",
        "Alexandra: It's all right. It's all right because I need to explain this. I need to see... the reason that I had to see you that night.",
        "Frank: And what is that reason?",
        "Alexandra: Because... because I felt terrible, Frank. About everything, I mean, for heaven... Phillip's treatment of Harley, your whole family had just been put through the wringer, for... I wanted to show your father that I was on his side, and I wanted to be here. I wanted to...",
        "Alan: None of this is admissible. You know that, Frank.",
        "Frank: So, wait. Hold on one second. So, you arranged to meet him?",
        "Alexandra: Yes. Yes, yes.",
        "Frank: Okay, where?",
        "Alexandra: At the Springfield Inn.",
        "Frank: The Springfield Inn. What name did you register under? Mrs. Godfrey?",
        "Alexandra: I don't remember!",
        "Frank: Of course you don't remember. You know why? Because you're lying.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, I beg your pardon?",
        "Frank: You know what, Alex? Is that your story? Because if it is, you're going to go straight back to prison, and guess what? You're going to have some company.",
        "Alexandra: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Do you remember the game against Oakdale?",
        "Beth: Yeah. (Both laugh)",
        "Rick: Look at this.",
        "Beth: You could have kept looking at this with her.",
        "Rick: Oh, it was so fun having her back. Do you know what we're going to do? (Crashing sound)",
        "Beth: What was that?",

        "Holly: You think you know me so well... (echoing)",
        "Sebastian: I know how badly... (echoing)",
        "Holly: You're not going to make me feel guilty. And you're not going to drag me into this abyss. Your time may be up, but I have more life ahead of me. Oh, damn you. Damn both of you!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: You know, Frank, it's not against the law to you know, provide an alibi for someone who's been accused of a crime.",
        "Frank: It is if you're lying. You didn't think this through too clearly did you, Alex?",
        "Alexandra: What are you talking about?",
        "Frank: The Springfield Inn was closed down the entire week for renovations.",
        "Alexandra: Well, did I say we went inside?",
        "Buzz: Give it up.",
        "Alexandra: No, no.",
        "Frank: Alex, why are you lying?",
        "Alan: Isn't it obvious? She's trying to protect her friend, Frank. God only knows why.",
        "Gus: Frank, you're losing control of the situation.",
        "Alexandra: Okay. I didn't actually lie. But the point is.. the truth is, I know your father did not shoot Phillip. He's innocent.",
        "Frank: Maybe he is. Maybe you're the guilty one. Now that I know that you were out of prison that night I can add you to my list of suspects.",
        "Alexandra: And wouldn't that be ridiculous? I loved Phillip. You know that. And why would I want to shoot him?",
        "Frank: I don't know. I'm still working on that. But you know what? If you weren't at the Springfield Inn, maybe you were at Company. Actually maybe both of you were there.",
        "Gus: And maybe they weren't, Frank. Maybe the person you're looking for is still out there. Maybe you should be out there looking for them.",

        "Gus: That's your father for God sakes, man.",
        "Frank: Yeah, that's exactly right. Which mean I need to be extra careful. Right, Pop?",

        "Rick: Does this mean what I think it means?",
