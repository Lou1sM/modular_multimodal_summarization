        "Josh: Marah. Hi. ",

        "Josh: Yeah, yeah, is everything okay? \r\n",
        "Marah: I just heard about Olivia getting \r\narrested with Alan Spaulding. Is there anything that I can do? ",
        "Josh: You're doing it, honey. ",
        "Marah: God, dad, I'm so sorry about all this.\r\n",
        "Josh: Yeah, so am I. ",
        "Marah: I know Olivia and I were definitely \r\nnot like best friends or anything, but I just can't believe that she would give \r\nAlan secret information about the company. Is this really true? ",
        "Josh: Well, not only is it true, I'm the one \r\nthat set them up. ",
        "",
        "\r\nOlivia: I could push you right off this balcony and not feel a thing. \r\n",
        "Alan: Olivia, it's not me you're angry with.\r\n",
        "Olivia: You sure about that, Alan? You ruined \r\nmy marriage and what, for all this lousy ego trip. ",
        "Alan: My ego or yours? Tell me something, \r\nOlivia, why... why would you want to be married to a man who would set you up \r\nand then watch as you're carted off to jail? ",
        "Olivia: Because I betrayed him first. \r\n",
        "Alan: You're not the only one upset here. I \r\nspent the night in jail also, thanks to your beloved Josh. ",
        "Olivia: If you hadn't blackmailed me, he \r\nwouldn't have set us up in the first place! This whole thing has been a \r\ndisaster! ",
        "Alan: I remember parts of it as not being a \r\ndisaster. I remember parts of it that we enjoyed very much. ",
        "Olivia: What are you thinking? Are you going \r\nto win my heart in a hostile takeover? ",
        "Alan: I don't remember you putting up a \r\nfight. I remember you enjoying our little tryst. As a matter of fact, I think \r\nthat's why you came out here, because this is where we shared our first kiss. I \r\nwanted you as much as you wanted me. ",

        "\r\n(Knocking on door) ",
        "Gus: Hello. What's the matter? Aren't you \r\nhappy to see me? (Whistles) Wow, what a nice joint. Who said crime doesn't \r\npay? (Laughs) ",
        "Carmen: I told you to stay in Springfield.\r\n",
        "Gus: Yeah. Yeah, you did. ",
        "Carmen: The plan was for Danny and Michelle \r\nto pull off a heist, go home and then you arrest them. What are you doing here?\r\n",
        "Gus: I'm not taking orders from you anymore.\r\n",
        "Carmen: Bad move. ",
        "Gus: Yeah? Well, you know what? You wouldn't \r\neven be on the outside if it weren't for me, Carmen. ",
        "Carmen: Well, you know what? You can't pull \r\nthis off without me. ",
        "Gus: Well, actually, nobody's pulling \r\nanything off. That's if Sandoval has his way. That's right, you heard me. \r\nSandoval and his brother are planning to stab you in the back. ",
        "Carmen: That's ridiculous. ",
        "Gus: No, it's not. I heard it from the \r\nhorse's mouth. ",
        "Carmen: They talk trash. ",
        "Gus: Do they? ",
        "Carmen: Yeah, they don't like taking orders \r\nfrom a woman, like some other people I know. ",
        "Gus: Well, actually, no, it's not trash. It's \r\n$25 million ready to be shanghaied. And if that happens, Carmen, you're going to \r\njail. ",
        "Carmen: They would never double-cross me.\r\n",
        "Gus: Well, maybe, maybe not. But you know \r\nwhat's funny? I have a funny, little, silly feeling that it's actually going to \r\nbe me that gets double- crossed here. ",
        "",
        "\r\nMichelle: Why would someone change the codes the second we're withdrawing the \r\nmoney? ",
        "Danny: I don't know. ",
        "Michelle: It's got to be a trap, Danny.\r\n",
        "Danny: There's no... ",
        "Michelle: It's got to be. We have to stop it.\r\n",
        "Danny: There's no way to prove that. No, no, \r\nno, no, no, we can't touch this. Just hold on. ",
        "Michelle: Danny, the new codes are being \r\nchanged faster than ours can be inputted. ",
        "Danny: I can see that. Wait, just wait. No, \r\nokay, no. This computer any second is going to spit our codes out as a no match, \r\nand they're going to try to nail us for grand theft. We got to get out of here.\r\n",
        "Michelle: Let's go. ",
        "Lowney: How's everything going? ",
        "Danny: Fine. Well, actually, we're wondering \r\nthe same thing, because... ",

        "\r\n\u00a0Carmen: So, you think I'm double-dealing you, huh? Call headquarters right now, \r\ntell them the sting is off. What's the matter, agent Aitoro? You're not ready to \r\ngive up your dream of taking down my son? ",
        "Gus: No, I'm not. ",
        "Carmen: Then call your boss. ",
        "Gus: Maybe you didn't hear me before. I'm not \r\ntaking orders from you. You don't have anything to worry about. I have it \r\ncovered, okay? ",
        "Carmen: Seems to me like someone's getting \r\ncold feet. ",
        "Gus: What are you, my shrink all of a sudden, \r\nCarmen? You don't have to analyze me. ",
        "Carmen: You're making me nervous. ",
        "Gus: Well, that's tough. ",
        "Carmen: I don't understand. You're supposed \r\nto catch Danny and Michelle red-handed. And now all of a sudden, you're telling \r\nme Carlos and Bernard want to horn in on the action? ",
        "Gus: Carlos and Bernard, tweedle-dee and \r\ntweedle-dum. I'm up to the challenge. ",
        "Carmen: If you're half as smart as you think \r\nyou are, you'd call for back up. ",
        "Gus: I told... I can handle it. I can handle \r\nall of you, okay? I can handle it. ",
        "Carmen: Oh, so you're proud, so proud...\r\n",
        "Gus: Please, knock it off, Carmen. \r\n",
        "Carmen: What, you want to screw this up? You \r\nwant Carlos and Bernard to pull some kind of stunt, Danny to fall through your \r\nfingers once again? ",
        "Gus: You know, I'm... I'm really not in the \r\nmood for you going over my operation, okay? Especially you, a felon... \r\n",
        "Carmen: Well, it's too bad because I'm just \r\nas involved in this as you are. After all this planning, you're this close to \r\nhaving them over a barrel, and you blink. I'm disappointed. ",
        "Gus: You know something? You are going to \r\nspend Christmas in jail along with your son and your daughter-in-law. \r\n",
        "Carmen: Stop, stop with the empty threats.\r\n",
        "Gus: They're not empty promises! ",
        "Carmen: They will be if you don't succeed. \r\nSo, go ahead, make your phone call. ",
        "Gus: (Sighs) You're going to do something \r\nright now. You're going to stop hounding me. ",
        "Carmen: Go ahead, the call's on me. Be my \r\nguest! ",
        "Gus: What part of \"no\" do you not understand, \r\nCarmen? ",
        "Carmen: Why, why are you being so obstinate?\r\n",
        "Gus: You know, talking to you is like talking \r\nto a wall. This is... It's pointless. ",
        "Carmen: I just gave you a damn good one.\r\n",
        "Gus: Well, you know what, you're not \r\nunderstanding? Get this through your skull: I am not calling Washington. You \r\ndon't know what goes on behind closed doors, okay. You just... just... Just...\r\n",
        "Carmen: Just what? ",
        "Gus: Just... just... Mind your own business!\r\n",
        "Carmen: Is there something going on here that \r\nI don't know about? Has something changed? Because I need to know. What's going \r\non, Gus? ",
        "Gus: All right, all right, all right. I'm off \r\nthe case. ",
        "Carmen: Well, that changes everything. What'd \r\nyou think, you were going to come down here like the Lone Ranger? Think again. \r\nOut. ",

        "Catalina: Ben, I wasn't crazy about helping \r\nyou keep Marah and Tony apart. Look, I don't want to play games. ",

        "Ben: The rose is yours to keep, okay? \r\nRegardless of whether you bail on me. But the more you hang with Tony, the more \r\ntime I have with Marah. If we both get what we want, what's the harm? \r\n",

        "Marah: How did you even know? ",
        "Josh: There were a lot of signs. Eventually, \r\nI saw them and set a trap. They walked into it. ",
