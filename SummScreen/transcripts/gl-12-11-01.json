        "Tony: Is what true? ",
        "Marah: What Olivia was just saying, what Sam \r\ntold me, that you're the one who found that picture of Felix Chavez? You're the \r\none who saved my father. You did that for me? ",
        "Tony: Yeah. It's true. It was me. ",

        "\r\nBuzz: You do look a little piqued, kid. ",
        "Holly: Plus that nasty bump on your head.\r\n",
        "Sam: (Groans) ",
        "Holly: It's still there. ",
        "Sam: Uh-huh. ",
        "Holly: You care to fill me in? ",
        "Sam: Do I have a choice? Okay, okay. \r\nYesterday, before I met you guys at Company, I was involved in a minor \r\naltercation. ",
        "Holly: Dare I ask with whom? ",
        "Sam: With an anonymous assailant at a \r\nwarehouse, and no, you cannot have the address. ",
        "Holly: I don't suppose this altercation had \r\nanything to do with the mob story you're not working on. ",
        "Sam: Well, if I'm not working on it, how \r\nwould I know? ",
        "Holly: Sam, this isn't cute anymore. It's \r\nbecoming downright dangerous. ",
        "Buzz: You know, she's right. You should back \r\noff the story and let the pros handle it. ",

        "Olivia: You know what? I'm looking for my \r\nbrother's room... ",
        "Claire: It's amazing that they let you out. \r\nOr did you break out, Olivia? ",
        "Olivia: You know what? If you don't mind...\r\n",
        "Claire: Then I'd have to make a citizen's \r\narrest. Did poor cuckold Josh, did he post bail for you? No, it must have been \r\nAlan, your partner in crime. How romantic. ",
        "",
        "\r\nAlan: You know, Josh, those SEC charges won't stick. My lawyer will have them \r\ndismissed in no time. ",
        "Josh: See, I would not count on that if I \r\nwere you, Alan. The SEC boys, I talked to them, and they've been trying to nail \r\nyou for a long time. They're not going to back off. ",
        "Alan: You know, this is so unlike you, Josh. \r\nUsually when you're angry with me, you show up at my house and shout and scream. \r\nBut to send the SEC over to my house to do your dirty work? Now that is almost \r\nsophisticated. ",
        "Josh: Well, I appreciate your saying that, \r\nAlan. You see, I figured I would go the business route this time because I know \r\nit's the language you speak. But make no mistake: What's happened between us is \r\nvery, very personal. ",
        "Alan: You're referring to your wife \r\nresponding to my attention, I assume. Well, if you are, you didn't have to go to \r\nall of this trouble to keep her from straying, Josh. All you have to do is \r\nsatisfy her. ",

        "\r\nMichelle: Okay, this is it. This is where we find out whether Carmen is with us \r\nor against us, whether she's Mr. Big... ",

        "Michelle: Danny, if she set us up, I swear...\r\n",
        "Danny: I'll handle it. Do you understand? I \r\nwill handle it. You just get Robbie and you get the hell out of here, even if \r\nthat means leaving me here alone. Honey, we've talked about this. Robbie's \r\nsafety comes first. Okay? ",
        "Michelle: Okay. ",
        "Danny: Ready? ",
        "Michelle: I'm ready as I'll ever be. \r\n",
        "Danny: I love you. ",
        "Michelle: I love you. ",
        "Carmen: Danny. I was so worried about you. Is \r\neverything all right? Did you get it? ",
        "Danny: $25 million in negotiable securities.\r\n",
        "Carmen: Did you have any problems at the \r\nbank? ",
        "Danny: Nothing we couldn't handle. \r\n",
        "Carmen: That's great. That's wonderful. Now \r\nall we have to do is take this case to Mr. Big and then we'll be done with all \r\nthis. You'll finally be free. ",
        "Michelle: Carmen, where's Robbie? ",
        "Carmen: Oh, he's upstairs sleeping. \r\n",
        "Danny: I'll get the bags. Why don't you get \r\nhim? We're leaving. ",
        "Gus: Sorry, kids, but the only place you're \r\ngoing is prison. ",

        "\r\nOlivia: Hi. Sam? ",
        "Sam: Oh, good to see you, sis. Glad you could \r\nmake it. Took you long enough. ",
        "Olivia: I'm sorry, honey. I just didn't check \r\nmy machine. ",
        "Sam: When I didn't come home last night, you \r\ndidn't think something might be wrong? ",
        "Olivia: (Laughs nervously) With a wild and \r\ncrazy guy like you? Are you kidding? So what's going on with you? You kind of \r\nlook terrible. ",
        "Sam: Oh, gee, thanks. I got so wrapped up in \r\nmy story I forgot to eat. I passed out. ",
        "Buzz: Twice. ",
        "Sam: And now everyone thinks I'm knocking at \r\ndeath's door. ",
        "Holly: Yeah, me thinks the lad downplays too \r\nmuch. ",
        "Olivia: Yeah, it certainly sounds that way, \r\ndoesn't it? ",
        "Sam: Oh, boy. Here she comes to poke me and \r\nprod me again. ",
        "Claire: No, just to talk to you, Sam. If \r\nyou'll excuse us. You can wait in the hall. ",
        "Olivia: No. He's my brother; I'm staying.\r\n",
        "Sam: Everyone can stay as far as I'm \r\nconcerned. So, tell us, Doc, I'm all fine and you're going to let me go, right?\r\n",
        "Claire: Sam? ",
        "Sam: Mmm? ",
        "Claire: When I examined you earlier, you had \r\na low-grade fever and swollen lymph glands. Now, your blood work shows an \r\nelevated white count, and these symptoms indicate... ",
        "Sam: Indicate that my body is fighting off an \r\ninfection. I have a cold. Big deal. ",
        "Claire: Your spleen is also enlarged. \r\n",
        "Sam: Oh. ",
        "Claire: Sam, that indicates a rather \r\nsignificant infection, more along the lines of mono or viral hepatitis. I mean, \r\nit could be a number of things. ",
        "Sam: So test me and treat me and release me.\r\n",
        "Claire: Well, there's more. When I was \r\nlistening to your chest, I heard evidence of a condition called pericarditis. \r\nNow, that's the... That's the inflammation of the sac that surrounds the heart.\r\n",
        "Buzz: All this from a bump on the head?\r\n",
        "Claire: Well, we believe that the infection \r\nwas there first, and that coupled with stress and not eating is probably what \r\nmade you faint, Sam. So I'm going to run some tests, and I will be back shortly. \r\nOkay? ",
        "Sam: Okay. Hey, lighten up, guys. I don't \r\ncare what she said. You know, I feel fine. There's nothing wrong with me. \r\n",

        "Alan: You set limits on her, Josh, \r\nboundaries. You tried to mold her into someone that you wanted, mold her into a \r\nbehavior that you wanted. But she's her own kind of woman. No man can own \r\nOlivia. She's priceless. ",
        "Josh: Yeah, she's also deceitful, Alan. She \r\nmanipulates, and the bottom line is, she doesn't love you. ",
        "Alan: Oh, that's where you're wrong. \r\n",
        "Josh: No, she never will love you, because \r\nit's not about love, what's between you. It's about power and money and who's \r\npulling the strings. ",
        "Alan: Well, if that's the way you think, \r\nyou're ill-informed, because what we have, you'll never understand. ",
        "Josh: I know you slept with her. ",
        "Alan: More than once. ",
        "Josh: You think that means there's something \r\nbetween the two of you. Let me tell you something: Olivia doesn't give a damn \r\nabout you. You're a means to an end for her. Think about this, Alan, If she \r\nbetrayed me, the husband that she claims she still loves, what makes you think \r\nshe won't betray you? ",

        "Marah: I know. ",
        "Tony: It was me who thought you weren't \r\nready. But you didn't agree. And when I wanted to slow things down, you got all \r\nmad at me and you even took it as an insult, like I wasn't attracted to you.\r\n",

I only wrote that piece for \r\nmyself. I just needed to vent. I needed to get some stuff out. You know, that's \r\nwhy I was so upset when Catalina posted it, because I knew how much it would \r\nhurt you. ",

In \r\nfact, why don't you throw that rock you have in your chest that you call a heart \r\nat her, because when you do that and she dumps you, it's going to hurt you even \r\nmore, and I'll be there to see it.
