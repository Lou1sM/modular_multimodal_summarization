        "Beth: Come on, why don't you come to the house for a little while, huh? ",
        "Lizzie: No, I've got to get back to Jonathan and Sarah. She's my best trick \r\nin the book. ",
        "Beth: Trick? ",
        "Lizzie: Well, before Sarah, tricks were all I had to make Jonathan love me. \r\nYou know, \"Jonathan, would you please rub my tired feet?\" Or \"Jonathan, take me \r\nto all my doctor's appointments\"-- which a real husband would do anyway. I don't \r\nknow. If he keeps loving the baby and he gets attached to our little family... I \r\nlove Sarah, and I love what Sarah can do for me, too. ",
        "Cassie: Hey. ",
        "Tammy: She just called her child a trick. ",
        "Cassie: Excuse me? ",
        "Tammy: Lizzie. She was just talking about Sarah like she's some kind of a toy \r\nthat she can use to help make Jonathan love her. ",
        "Cassie: Maybe you didn't hear her right. I'm sure Lizzie loves her baby. ",
        "Tammy: No, no, not the way a mother should. Look, I know I didn't see it, but \r\nI just heard her say that. ",
        "Cassie: Tammy, be careful. ",
        "Tammy: I gave up Jonathan because I thought it was the right thing to do \r\nbecause I thought that she had changed. What if it wasn't the right thing? Mom, \r\nwhat if Jonathan and that baby can do better than Lizzie? ",
        "Cassie: Tammy, Jonathan and Lizzie are married. ",
        "Tammy: Josh and Reva were married. That didn't stop you. ",
        "Cassie: Yeah, it did. Okay, I was supposed to meet Josh to pick out a \r\nChristmas tree, but I'm going to call and cancel because we need to talk about \r\nthis. ",
        "Tammy: No, no, you have plans. You have plans, keep them. I'm not going to do \r\nanything crazy. ",
        "Cassie: You're sure? ",
        "Tammy: Yes. What Lizzie said just caught me by surprise, that's all. It kind \r\nof makes you re-think things. ",
        "Cassie: You mean you and Jonathan? ",
        "",
        "Jonathan: What is all that stuff? ",
        "Reva: For starters, there's a rocking horse, there's her first swing, there's \r\ntoys and clothes. ",
        "Josh: Okay, there you go. Oh, hang on, and thank you very much. Merry \r\nChristmas. ",
        "Delivery man: Same to you. Congratulations. ",
        "Josh: Thank you. Yes, Jonathan, congratulations and welcome to the exciting \r\nworld of assembling baby stuff. ",
        "Reva: Yeah, and if you get busy, and get right on top of it, you could maybe \r\nhave it all put together by the time she graduates high school. ",
        "Jonathan: You guys aren't going to help me? ",
        "Reva: Of course we're going to help you. ",
        "Jonathan: Good. Well, I need to go online and look for a new car because now \r\nI'm going to have to have a car with a back seat so I can put little Sarah\u2019s \r\nbaby bucket in there. Otherwise I won't be able to drive her. And also after we \r\nfind that, maybe you can help me pick out a high chair thing that she's going to \r\neat at... ",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) ",
        "Jonathan: Well, it's important. ",
        "Josh: I'm sorry, but isn't some of this stuff the kind of thing that you \r\nshould do with-- I don't know-- your wife? ",
        "",
        "Harley: Hi, it's me. Wish you were here. I'm standing here looking at \r\nChristmas trees, and I'm actually thinking about that little baby Sydney. I \r\ncan't get her out of my mind, you know? Her parents are, you know, freaks, and \r\nthen her grandmother goes and dies on her, and now she's in foster care for \r\nChristmas. It's just sad. But, anyway, where are you? Call me. Bye. ",
        "",
        "Rick: Hey, perfect timing. Come on in. Get warm. ",
        "Mel: Is Harley and Gus here? ",
        "Rick: No, it's just us. ",
        "Mel: Rick... ",
        "Rick: Honey, when you called me, you told me you wanted to see me in private. \r\nYou actually sounded pretty happy that we'd have the place to ourselves, so I \r\ndid things up a little bit. What do you think? ",
        "Mel: This is not what I had in mind. ",
        "Rick: Well, good, that means it's a surprise then, doesn\u2019t it? ",
        "Mel: What I'm saying is when I asked if I could see you, I didn't mean for a \r\nromantic dinner. ",
        "Rick: Honey, you want red or white? ",
        "Mel: Neither. ",
        "Rick: Come on, you must have come here to tell me something. ",
        "Mel: Yeah. I want a divorce. ",
        "",
        "Cassie: I have an idea: You could come with me help pick out our Christmas \r\ntree. ",
        "Tammy: Mom, I told you, I'm okay. ",
        "Cassie: Whoa, what are you doing? ",
        "Tammy: I am getting you out of here because you have a man to meet and a tree \r\nto find. Do not worry about me, okay? I'm just going to go on with my life, \r\nwhich means studying for my abnormal psych test, okay? I love you. ",
        "Cassie: Love you, too. ",
        "Tammy: Good-bye. Thank you. ",
        "Cassie: Good-bye. ",
        "Tammy: Lizzie. ",
        "Lizzie: Hey. You okay? You don't look so hot. ",
        "Tammy: What are you doing back here? ",
        "Lizzie: I forgot my cell phone. I've got to get it and get back to Jonathan \r\nand Sarah. You know me, anything for the baby. ",
        "Tammy: Oh, really. Anything for the baby, huh? ",
        "Lizzie: Did I miss something? ",
        "Tammy: No. You know what, I think I did. ",
        "Lizzie: Okay. ",
        "Tammy: All this time, I gave you the benefit of the doubt. I believed you \r\nwhen you said you wanted to try to be a good mother and put your baby's needs \r\nfirst. ",
        "Lizzie: That's what I did. ",
        "Tammy: No, it's not. ",
        "Lizzie: What is your problem? ",
        "Tammy: I heard you. I heard you talking about how Sarah is the best trick in \r\nyour book. ",
        "Lizzie: What? ",
        "Tammy: Yeah, sorry, I just happened to be standing close enough to hear every \r\nnauseating word about how you're going to use Sarah to manipulate Jonathan. ",
        "Lizzie: Tammy... ",
        "Tammy: Oh, what's next? You're going to stare me straight in the face and try \r\nto deny that you said that you loved Sarah, but that you also loved what she can \r\ndo for you? ",
        "Lizzie: No, I said that. You just misunderstood me. ",
        "Tammy: Oh really? What part, the part about you scamming Jonathan or the part \r\nabout you using your daughter to do it? ",
        "Lizzie: I don't think I can explain this to you. ",
        "Tammy: No, I don't think you can. ",
        "Lizzie: I can't because you can't possibly get it. You're not a mother. ",
        "Tammy: Okay, but you know what I do get, is that you were suckering both \r\nJonathan and me all this time. ",
        "Lizzie: Leave me alone. ",
        "Tammy: I left the man that I loved because I truly believed that you were \r\ngoing to do everything you could to be there for him and his little girl. ",
        "Lizzie: She's my daughter, too. ",
        "Tammy: Yeah, and who's the one who did everything possible to try to make \r\nthings easier for you? Me. Understanding, trusting, gullible Tammy. I helped you \r\ndeliver the baby! Ask me how stupid I feel now and how pissed off. ",
        "Lizzie: You really don't have to freak out. ",
        "Tammy: Yeah, I think I do. All I wanted was for Jonathan to have a child that \r\ncould be safe and happy. And the life that I thought I gave him was a lie. ",
        "",
        "Josh: Sorry, sorry, sorry. Okay, this is going to all be basically part \"A\" \r\ngoes into part \"B.\" Look, all I'm saying is that you're not doing your daughter \r\nor yourself any favors by raising her in a house where the parents are just \r\nhusband and wife and nothing else to each other. That's all. ",
        "Reva: Hey, he cares about Lizzie, right? ",
        "Jonathan: Sure, yeah. And I want this to be a real marriage. I mean, \r\neverything I've done, every decision I've made has been in support of that. ( \r\nBaby crying ) She's singing my song. ",
        "Josh: Sorry. Okay... ",
        "Reva: What? ",
        "Josh: I can tell already that I have put together buildings that are less \r\ncomplicated than this. ",
        "Reva: Well, it's her first swing. ",
        "Josh: I know, I know. Could you hand me that thing right there? That would be \r\ngreat. ",
        "Reva: Okay. Thank you, Joshua. ",
        "Josh: Well, it's not actually as hard as I'm making it out to be. ",
        "Reva: No, actually, I mean, thank you for this. Jonathan can really use you \r\naround here. ",
        "Josh: Well, I do have sort of a vested interest in the outcome. ",
        "Reva: What do you mean? ",
        "Josh: I guess part of me thinks of Sarah as-- I don't know-- my first \r\ngrandchild. ",

        "Cassie: Actually, no, I was just wondering where Josh is. He should have been \r\nhere by now. ",
        "Harley: That's right, it's your first Christmas together. ",
        "Cassie: All right, lady, move it along. ",
        "Harley: No, I can't, because I'm actually looking for a Christmas tree, too. \r\nAnd what a coincidence, I can't find Gus, either. But actually, maybe that's a \r\ngood thing because now we can pick out the trees we want. ",
        "Cassie: Ah, yes. ",

        "Rick: Maybe fire's not such a good thing. ",
        "Mel: We have been in limbo for months, Rick. It's not a healthy situation for \r\nLeah or for us, either. ",
        "Rick: So what do we do? We just bag our marriage, write the whole thing off?\r\n",
        "Mel: I know that you think we can work it out. ",
        "Rick: And you don't believe that, obviously. ",
        "Mel: I don't believe we can. ",
        "Rick: Why not? Why not? ",
        "Mel: Because if I'm honest, this thing with Beth... ",
        "Rick: It's over. I told you it was over. I broke it off with her a long time \r\nago. I haven't seen her and I don't intend to see her. And you don't believe \r\nthat either. ",
        "Mel: There's just so much damage that's been done. ",
        "Rick: You're right. There has been. But I have to believe... I have to \r\nbelieve there's a reason that we're not already divorced. ",
        "Mel: Denial. ",
        "Rick: How about hope? Honey, if we don't have hope, we don't have a damn \r\nthing. I love you. ",

        "Rick: Did Mel see you? ",
        "Beth: Rick, relax. I'm not stupid. I didn't park in the driveway, and I \r\nwaited for her to leave. ",
        "Rick: What are you doing here? ",

        "Rick: That's a good thing, right? ",
        "Beth: Yeah, except Lizzie and Jonathan served Alan with a restraining order \r\nto keep him away from Sarah. And here's the thing: Alan may think that I \r\nbetrayed him. So I'm not going home tonight. I'm going to stay here. ",
        "Rick: No, you can't do that. ",
        "Beth: Rick, Rick... ",
        "Rick: Beth, listen to me. I'm trying very hard to patch up my marriage, okay? \r\nAnd I really don't think you and I being alone... I don't think you and I being \r\nalone here is a good thing. ",
        "Beth: Okay. Rick, Rick, now this is not about sex; this is about safety. Come \r\non. You were my friend long before we were lovers. Come on, Rick. I need my old \r\nfriend. ",

        "Reva: You know, we should put together a head count for Sarah\u2019s christening. \r\nWhat do you think? At least our list. ",

Not that Reva \r\nand Josh are together, but they have the little special thing that it takes to \r\nraise little people like you. They have that heart. Okay. See, daddy didn't have \r\nthat when he was growing up. He didn't have anybody to make him feel like he was \r\nthe most important thing in the world. But you're going to feel that way. \r\nUh-huh.

        "Lizzie: That's not true. ",
        "Tammy: You're using her to try to make Jonathan love you. you just said that \r\nyourself. So let me ask you this: How do you think Jonathan would feel about \r\nthat if he found out?",

        "Tammy: Jonathan still loves me. That hasn't changed. ",
        "Lizzie: Jonathan loves Sarah, the little girl that I gave him. That's right, \r\nTammy, Jonathan and I have a daughter. And like I said before, you couldn't \r\npossibly understand how strong that bond is because you're not a mother. You \r\ndidn't have Jonathan\u2019s baby. I did. ",
        "Tammy: Yeah, and now you have him trapped, right? ",

She tells me that all she has to do is make a couple of \r\nphone calls and she can get my restraining order squashed. So you see, I don't \r\nthink she has failed me in any way. As a matter of fact, I think Doris is the \r\nkind of winner that I am looking for. ",
