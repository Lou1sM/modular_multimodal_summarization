        "Richard: I can't stand being away from you \r\neven for a day. The good part is, you know, when I come back and I see you \r\nagain, it's like seeing you for the first time. And you can still take my breath \r\naway. What's wrong? ",
        "Cassie: I'm sorry. ",
        "Richard: It's Camille, isn't it? Listen, \r\ndarling, I'm sure the only reason that she's here is to see for herself that \r\nWill's all right. ",
        "Cassie: She's his birth mother. You know, \r\nwhat if she changes her mind about the adoption? ",
        "Richard: Hey, she can't. Besides, you know, \r\nwe have the adoption papers. Cassie, nothing's going to happen to our family.\r\n",
        "Cassie: Why do I have this feeling in the pit \r\nof my stomach? ",
        "Richard: Well, because you feel that the more \r\ntime that Camille spends with the baby, the more attached she'll become and it \r\nwill make it that much more difficult for her to leave. ",
        "Cassie: I don't want to judge her, you know, \r\nbut she gave up her baby. I mean, that's something I could never do. And I'm \r\njust afraid that she's going to be around him and she's... ",
        "Richard: Cassie, listen to me. No one is \r\ngoing to take our boy away from us. Well, hello. ",
        "Camille: (Laughs) Hi. The baby looks just \r\ngreat. I was just talking to the doctors and they said that he'll be able to \r\ncome home tomorrow. ",
        "Cassie: We know. ",
        "Camille: I missed him so much. Of course, his \r\ndaddy, too. ",
        "Richard: It's wonderful news, isn't it, and \r\nI'm sure it's going to help to make your trip home that much easier. ",
        "Camille: My what? ",
        "Richard: And, you know, I insist that we fly \r\nyou back first class. ",
        "Camille: But... but I don't want to go home \r\nyet. ",
        "",
        "\r\nRick: Vitals! We're losing him. ",
        "Mel: He's in V-Tach. ",
        "Rick: Okay. Give me 100 Lido. ",
        "Mel: Okay. Hit him. ",
        "Rick: Clear. ",
        "Mel: He's a systolic. ",
        "Rick: All right, I'm going to hit him again. \r\nWe got to clear a pathway. Clear. ",
        "Mel: All right, let me give him some EPI.\r\n",
        "Rick: All right, he's coming back. Okay.\r\n",
        "Mel: That was close. ",
        "Rick: Now, set up a Lido drip right away. \r\nWhere are those labs? ",
        "Mel: Dr. Ramsey's working on it. She's \r\nstudying his echo and we're doing more blood work, so... ",
        "Rick: How did this kid end up here? \r\n",

        "\r\nCarmen: I'm not amused, Carlos. ",
        "Carlos: Something I'm going to have to learn \r\nto live with, my dear. ",
        "Gus: Handle this, Carmen. ",
        "Carmen: We had a deal. ",
        "Carlos: My brother and I and our associates \r\nhave decided to rewrite the terms of our deal. After all, $25 million in \r\nsecurities are barely enough for us. ",
        "Bernardo: And if we had to share it with \r\nyou... ",
        "Carlos: You see our dilemma. ",
        "Carmen: I always thought you were a lot \r\nsmarter than him, Bernardo. What happened? You know the penalty for such a \r\nbetrayal. ",
        "Bernardo: No witnesses, no betrayal. \r\n",
        "Carlos: As always, Carmen, it's been a \r\npleasure doing business with you. ",
        "Danny: This is all your fault, Aitoro! \r\n",
        "Gus: My fault? My fault? (Struggling)\r\n",
        "Bernardo: No, no, leave him alone. This \r\nshould be fun, huh? (Laughter) ",
        "Gus: It's your whole demented family's fault!\r\n",
        "Carlos: Okay, okay, break it up. That's \r\nenough. ",
        "Bernardo: No, let them get it out of their \r\nsystem. (Helicopter whirring outside) ",
        "Man: We have the place surrounded. Come out \r\nwith your hands up! ",
        "Carlos: What the hell is this? Grab the girl \r\nand the kid. They're our ticket out of here. ",
        "Michelle: (Screaming) ",
        "Carmen: Danny! (Grunting) Where are they? \r\nWhere are they? What's that? (Helicopter whirring stops) ",
        "Danny: It's my insurance policy. It just \r\nkicked in. ",
        "Michelle: You did this? ",
        "Danny: Because I knew there was a good chance \r\nyou would double-cross us. So I set up a little surprise. There are no cops \r\noutside. I arranged the little fight with Aitoro so I could flip the panic \r\nswitch. ",
        "Michelle: Why didn't you tell me? ",
        "Danny: Honey... ",
        "Gus: Listen, nothing has changed, all right? \r\nNothing has changed. The game is over. You have stolen $25 million. You can \r\nthank your mother. You're under arrest. ",
        "",
        "\r\nCamille: I didn't come all this way just to turn around and get right back on a \r\nplane. I mean, Iowa is not right next door, you know. I dropped everything \r\nbecause I thought that my baby might need me. He did have a near brush with \r\ndeath, right? ",
        "Richard: Yes, he did. He gave us all quite a \r\nscare. But as you saw for yourself, he's doing much better now. ",
        "Camille: Well, thanks to his daddy. Your \r\npaternal instincts just kicked in, didn't they? I know, because that's what's \r\nhappening with me and my maternal instincts. It's amazing. Just knowing that \r\nyour child needs you and there is no one else that can help them. God, it is the \r\nmost amazing feeling. I've never felt it before. ",
        "Cassie: It's the most wonderful feeling in \r\nthe world, isn't it? And it's only natural that you would feel that way. I mean, \r\nyou brought that beautiful little baby into the world. I'm sure you love him; we \r\nall do. ",
        "Camille: I'm sure you do. ",
        "Cassie: And like I told you when we adopted \r\nWill from you, we told you that we would love him as our own and we do. \r\n",
        "Alonzo: Would you excuse us? I'd like to show \r\nCamille around a little bit. Come here. What are you doing? What are you doing? \r\nYou got to be careful the way you talk to Richard and Cassie. They're Will's \r\nparents now. ",
        "Camille: Yeah, adoptive parents. ",
        "Alonzo: They're responsible for him. Don't \r\nforget, you signed away all your rights. ",
        "Camille: I have no right to worry about the \r\nbaby that I brought into this world? What, I don't exist? ",
        "Alonzo: Nobody is saying that. ",
        "Camille: Look, I know that I must seem really \r\nflaky right now. You know, one minute I'm trying to give away my baby and the \r\nnext minute I'm all worried about what happens to him. But look at you. You're \r\nworried, too. Why shouldn't you be? We're his parents, the real parents. We \r\nbrought that little fellow into this world, you and me. So don't tell me that I \r\nshouldn't care about what happens to him. ",
        "Alonzo: I think you do care. You proved that \r\nwhen you gave him up. You had the guts to do what was best for Will. That's the \r\nbest thing that you as his mother could have done. You made a mature, grown-up \r\ndecision, and you should be very proud of yourself for it. ",
        "Camille: Boy, have you ever changed, not for \r\nthe better. ",
        "",
        "\r\nMel: Still stable. ",
        "Rick: For now. This just doesn't make any \r\nsense. I mean, this is a strong, vital kid. I mean, we're talking about a rock \r\nclimber. Why would he be going through something like this? I mean, I know that \r\nhe got knocked in the head, but... ",
        "Mel: Yeah, but the swollen lymph glands the \r\nenlarged spleen have nothing to do with head trauma. I mean, it sounds more like \r\nan infection. We went over everything he ate at Company last night and drew a \r\nblank. ",
        "Rick: I know, something... But something's \r\ncausing this. Somewhere, somehow he came in contact with something and it's...\r\n",
        "Mel: Right, well, maybe if it's not something \r\nhe ate, then he might have gotten contact with something environmentally. \r\n",
        "Rick: All right, what do your notes say?\r\n",
        "Mel: Let's see, just that he was in a \r\nwarehouse before he collapsed. ",
        "Rick: I know, we've been through all of this.\r\n",
        "Mel: Well, why don't you ask him? ",
        "Rick: All right. Sam? Sam, can you hear me? \r\nSam, can you tell us what happened? ",
        "Sam: This is Samuel Marcus Spencer, 1300 \r\nhours. I should get the hell out of here right now, but I think I have just \r\nenough time to check out the contraband in this crate. What is this? Statue, \r\ndefinitely pre- Columbian. Possibly Aztec or maybe Mayan. I don't know, I can't \r\ntell. Some type of deity or idol... (Crashes) (whispering): Satanic. \r\n",
        "Mel: What did he say? ",
        "Rick: Satanic? ",
        "Mel: Well, what is that? I mean... \r\n",
        "Rick: Can you say it again? Sam? ",
        "Mel: Is he trying to say something else?\r\n",
        "Rick: Pupils are equal, but sluggish. He's \r\nslipping again. ",
        "Danny: What do you need us for, Aitoro? \r\nYou've got the Sandoval brothers wrapped up like Christmas presents. ",
        "Michelle: You know we didn't do anything we \r\nweren't forced to do. ",
        "Gus: You know, something, Michelle? Life is \r\nmade up of a series of choices. You could have even gone to the police if you \r\nwanted you. Do you ever get tired of playing the victim? ",
        "Danny: Oh, yeah, this coming from the world's \r\nleading victim. ",
        "Gus: I have come too far, I have worked too \r\nhard to listen to anymore of your rubbish, Santos, okay? It's over. Deal with \r\nit. ",
        "FBI agent: This is the FBI! ",
        "Babe: Make sure this place is surrounded. I \r\ndon't want any surprises. Out. ",
        "Gus: Finally, the cavalry shows up. \r\n",
        "Babe: I thought I took you off this case. \r\nGood work, Carmen. ",
        "Carmen: Pleasure doing business with you.\r\n",
        "Gus: Wait a second. \"Good work, Carmen,\" what \r\nare you talking about? What's going on here? ",
        "Danny: Who are you? ",
        "Babe: I'm Babe Stankowski, FBI agent in \r\ncharge. Danny and Michelle, the FBI and I myself would like to apologize to you \r\nfor putting you through this, but we had no choice. We had to use you in order \r\nto get to the Sandovals. And we couldn't have done it without you. ",
        "Carmen: Thank you. I did it all for my \r\nfamily. My family always comes first. ",

        "Cassie: I want to stick around. ",

        "\r\nCamille: Where is that wild man that I used to know? You know, dancing under the \r\nstars and going wherever the wind took him. Marrying an island-hopping American \r\non a whim. God, didn't we have fun? ",
        "Alonzo (as an old man): Sorry, I can't \r\nquite get what you're saying. Could you speak into my good ear? (Laughter) come \r\non, we had a great time. I know we did, it was fantastic. But I... I was a lot \r\nyounger then. ",
        "Camille: It was last year. ",
        "Alonzo: It was a lifetime ago. Things are \r\ndifferent for us. And it's not just because we're parents. We're different \r\npeople now. Heck, I bet if you saw me walking down the street today you wouldn't \r\neven give me a second look. ",
        "Camille: Sure I would. ",
        "Alonzo: You know we had a good thing. We had \r\na great thing. We had a great time together. And of course, we're going to \r\nfeel... We're going to feel this pull towards Will because he's a part of that \r\npast, a part of our great time in San Cristobel. But there has to come a time \r\nwhere we both move on. ",
        "Camille: Well, you've certainly moved on and \r\nup. ",
        "Alonzo: I moved on. ",

I gave \r\nyou every chance I could, and all you could see was nailing Danny, legally or \r\nnot. ",
