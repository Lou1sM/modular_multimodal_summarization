        "Marina: How could a baby just disappear like that?",
        "Mallet: Well, the social worker thought we had the baby. We thought the social worker had the baby. Stuff happens.",
        "Marina: I hope the foster parents took her.",
        "Mallet: Well, me too, but the foster parents aren't picking up the phone, and that's not a good sign.",
        "Marina: Yeah, but to just have a baby disappear like that, take a baby.",
        "Mallet: Yeah. Someone would have to be pretty damn desperate.",
        "Gus: Anybody want a coffee?",
        "Marina: Hey. No thank you. We're just... you tell him.",
        "Mallet: I think I've got some bad news, Gus. You know that baby that you and Harley took care of a while back?",
        "Gus: Sydney?",
        "Mallet: Yeah. Yeah. She's missing. Now, we're hoping she was picked up by her foster parents who were assigned to her, but if she wasn't...",
        "Gus: Well, she was at the station, yeah. I'm sure it was the foster parents, you know, probably picked her up.",
        "Mallet: Well, we hope, so but just in case...",
        "Gus: That wasn't the case.",
        "Mallet: Yeah.",
        "Gus: I'll keep an eye out.",
        "Mallet: If you hear anything, you, you know.",
        "Gus: Let me know and I'll let you know.",

        "Ashlee: Just say, thank you so much, Ashlee, you deserve a raise.",
        "Dinah: What is that?",
        "Ashlee: This is the rough copy of \"The Law.\" Mallet didn't want me seeing it, but, I don't know. I have my ways. I bribed this guard at the studio who said that I should really, go out...",
        "Dinah: Don't even get into it with me. Hit play, please.",
        "Ashlee: Wow. They really do have some chemistry. I hope nothing's really going on.",
        "Dinah: I'll tell you what, Ashlee. Which do you value more, your job or your life? Because if you don't stop, you're going to lose both of them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: What?",
        "Coop: Shouldn't you be hibernating right now in the wintertime?",
        "Ava: Well, it's not quite winter just yet, and anyway, I wouldn't sleep. I got too much on my mind.",
        "Coop: Well, tell you what. Here, is something else to think about. Happy birthday.",
        "Ava: My birthday was last week.",
        "Coop: No, no, no. Not according to my calendar.",
        "Ava: It used to be today, but then I found out this wasn't the day Olivia had me. I guess my mom decided we were going to celebrate my adoption day as my birthday, not the day a woman gave birth to a kid she didn't want.",
        "Coop: Ouch. You know what? I think your mom was right. Ava, today is the day that should matter the most, so why don't we celebrate, like today is your birthday. What do you say?",
        "Ava: I say no. Birthdays suck with Jeffrey and Olivia, and I want to forget about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: You rang?",
        "Harley: Boy, that was quick.",
        "Mallet: Oh, good.",

        "Mallet: Okay, what do you need?",
        "Harley: Gus. He's killing himself. Could you take over some of his workload for me, please? You know that we're trying to get pregnant. He's stressed out. The man can't even....",
        "Mallet: It's too much information.",
        "Harley: Okay. What I'm saying to you is he's been at the station all night. He hasn't even come home yet. 24 hours he's been on duty.",
        "Mallet: What are you talking object? He isn't on duty. I just saw him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Are you all right? I know this is a little crazy, but I didn't want you to get lost in the system, and not feel loved. Because I love you. We both love you. We wanted a baby so badly and it doesn't seem like I can do that, but, hey, you've been so good and so quiet. I'll make a little deal with you. If we run into anybody, anybody at all, you just let me do all the talking, okay? Because we don't want anybody to find us just yet. What I'll do for you is, I'll change that diaper. Stay right there.",

        "Dinah: Well, I'm doing something nice.",

        "Harley: Guys. I mean this is fascinating, but could you take this little competition someplace else? Because I'm busy.",
        "Mallet: All right. I'm sorry. She's worried about this Gus thing.",
        "Dinah: What Gus thing?",
        "Mallet: Gus apparently stayed out all night.",

        "Mallet: What?",
        "Harley: It's not like you're making it sound.",
        "Mallet: I didn't mean it to sound like that.",
        "Dinah: Well, has he been acting strange lately?",
        "Harley: No, no more than usual.",
        "Dinah: I'm just saying if it were me, I would be checking out where Mallet is, be following him around.",
        "Harley: Well, I'm not you.",
        "Dinah: I know. Just saying I'd be checking his pockets, making sure everything's okay, but...",

        "Harley: Bye, \"D\".",
        "Dinah: Okay. Take care. You know. Don't worry about it. Good luck. Not that you need it. And, you know, I mean, if you were anybody else, but you're not anyone else, but things are going to be okay with you two. It's going to be fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: So this buddy of mine had an accident and asked me if I would take care of the kid for a bit. I'm like, yeah, sure. You know.",
        "Alan-Michael: Where is his wife?",
        "Gus: His wife is dead. Had an accident. Could you pass me one of those? So there's nobody to take care of the kid. They had a babysitter, but the babysitter apparently burned down the house, set the couch on fire with a candle or something. No. Cigarette, I think it was. And they called the fire department. What is wrong with this diaper?",
        "Alan-Michael: It's you. You got to... here. Fold it... it's right here. Right.",
        "Gus: I guess so.",
        "Alan-Michael: Hey, you.",
        "Gus: Should have used powder.",
        "Alan-Michael: She's so cute. I mean, as far as babies go. And it was smart of your friend to leave her with another smoker.",
        "Gus: I quit.",
        "Alan-Michael: Especially guys a whiz with the diaper. Your story's lame.",
        "Gus: Yeah, I know. This is baby Sydney from the police department, and we had taken her for a couple of days at one point but now her parents are in jail, and the grandmother, who was taking care of her is dead and she doesn't have anybody to take care of her. Except for us, so... I took her.",
        "Alan-Michael: You took her, like, out for ice cream? Or you took her, like, stole her?",
        "Gus: I know this is a little crazy, all right? But this kid needs parents and we really, really wanted to have a child, and we took her home for a couple of days and the boys really fell in love with her and she fits. You know, sometimes these things aren't meant to be, but she really fit into our life. And then down at the station I see Harley holding her and they were going to take the baby away and give her to strangers and I couldn't let that happen, so I just-- I picked her up and I walked out the door. Wait, wait. Son of a bitch. Who are you calling?",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm not calling the cops.",
        "Gus: Who are you calling?",
        "Alan-Michael: My attorney, all right? If you're really going to fight to keep this kid, you're going to need help.",

        "Coop: Yeah. Well, that's because I got in contact with Oxford.",
        "Ava: Shut up.",
        "Coop: No, no. They offered me the same writing spot for their writing program. It starts this winter semester. What do you think?",
        "Ava: I think that's great. I think that's awesome.",
        "Coop: I couldn't believe it myself.",
        "Ava: That's great.",
        "Coop: Look, just come with me. Please, alright? We'll find a flat by the school, all right? We'll find a local pub, that we can become regulars there. You know, it will just be the two of us, you and me, no one else. You can even get a job there if you want to. Ava, what's wrong?",
        "Ava: I've just been so wrapped up in my life, and everything that's been going on, I can't even be happy for my boyfriend when he's doing something nice for me.",

        "Alan-Michael: It doesn't matter who wants to adopt. Just get me the information I'm asking for and set up... I'll call you back. You made it.",
        "Ava: Yeah. I'm sorry I'm late.",
        "Alan-Michael: Another accident?",
        "Ava: It's my birthday, sort of.",
        "Alan-Michael: Sort of?",
        "Ava: Sort of, which I don't want to talk about. Can we just work?",
        "Alan-Michael: Fine.",
        "Ava: Great.",
        "Alan-Michael: Here.",
        "Ava: Thank you.",
        "Alan-Michael: Why don't we start with the letter you wrote to a company, the prospectus?",
        "Ava: Yeah, it's terrible, right? I'm going rewrite it today.",
        "Alan-Michael: No, it's great.",
        "Ava: What?",
        "Alan-Michael: I thought I might be giving you too much but every time I do, you nail it. Now, I'd like you to incorporate some of that into our annual report and present at our meeting, board meeting in January.",
        "Ava: About the meeting in January, um...",
        "Alan-Michael: Oh, I know, I know. You deserve a raise. Believe me, you're going to get one. I won't even make you beg. It's a joke.",
        "Ava: I know it's a joke. It's just that I don't expect to be here in January. I'm moving to England with Coop.",
        "Alan-Michael: You're what?",
        "Ava: I'll help you find a replacement. It's not that big a deal. Shouldn't be that hard.",

        "Coop: Actually, I am. And Ava's coming with me, too.",
        "Jeffrey: Really? For how long is this?",
        "Coop: Indefinitely.",
        "Jeffrey: That's good. It's good. I guess Ava's thrilled to be getting away from this place.",
        "Coop: Well, can you really blame her?",
        "Jeffrey: So family, I guess you'll be staying with family?",
        "Coop: Yeah. Ava.",
        "Jeffrey: Just Ava? You guys have lived together before?",
        "Coop: No, not officially.",
        "Jeffrey: Not officially? You have to take her all the way to another country where she doesn't know anybody and she'll be totally dependent oven you, right?",
        "Coop: What? What? Why all the questions all of a sudden? Are you trying to be some sort of a dad right now or something?",
        "Jeffrey: No, I'm not trying to be a dad. It's the last thing I need, trust me.",
        "Coop: Right, right. Okay, because you said you didn't want the responsibility. All right. Okay. I guess you just feel guilty right now and you're just trying to ease your conscience for not being there so you want to be a concerned dad and all? Let me ask you a question, do you honestly feel like you deserve Ava? I mean, do you think you really deserve this beautiful, this wonderful, this amazing daughter in your life?",
        "Jeffrey: No.",
        "Coop: No is right. You conceived her in the worst possible fashion, and you've made it quite clear that you don't even know how to be a parent. You and Olivia...",
        "Jeffrey: Olivia and I are not in this together, okay? Olivia may have known about Ava but I didn't even know that she existed until last week. Excuse me.",
        "Coop: Uh-huh. And you just couldn't wait to catch up with her, huh? Could you? You were so welcoming to Ava, you wanted to catch up and make up for all the lost time you didn't have with her, right? Do you know how badly you hurt her?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that was not my intention.",
        "Coop: No. Well, we know what your intention was, just get laid and walk off and get out of there, never be seen again, right? Well, congratulations, captain, you did that. You made your choice, all right? And now it's Ava's turn to make her choice. And what she does or doesn't do is none of your damn business, really.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, actually, I... made you a promise, Olivia and I'm going to keep it. I'll stay out of Ava's life. I'll pretend I don't even know her, if that's what it takes... Actually, you're right. It is none of my business.",

        "Ava: Cristoli report. You have that meeting today at 3:00.",
        "Alan-Michael: Oh, right. I forgot. See? What am I going to do without you?",
        "Ava: You're going to be just fine without me. I've giving you enough time to find a replacement, which I will help you train and I will make sure that she can type twice as fast as I can.",
        "Alan-Michael: It's not your typing that impresses me. You've got a real knack for this stuff, Ava. You're a natural.",
        "Ava: Oh, please, a natural. Come on. Look, I really appreciate everything you've done for me. You've been a great boss and I love working here.",
        "Alan-Michael: Well, vice versa. You know? I started to think you had a real future at Spaulding.",
        "Ava: Well, thanks. Who knows, maybe I'll come back here one day, but my future right now is with Coop.",

        "Dinah: I don't think people are interested in that anymore.",
        "Ashlee: Well, okay. But-- oh, pick up bars. We could videotape their moves and then interview them afterwards. I think that would be-- well, look there. They sure look cozy.",
        "Dinah: They're partners. They're discussing a case. Hey. Hey, Marina.",
        "Ashlee: Are you guys discussing a case?",

        "Dinah: Really? How old?",
        "Mallet: It's that kid that Gus and Harley took care of for that one night. Nice, by the way, nice what you did to Harley.",
        "Dinah: Sorry-- what I did?",
        "Mallet: Well if I was you, I'd be all jealous and suspicious.",
        "Dinah: I don't think women can be too careful these days. And I see things.",
        "Mallet: You see things up here.",
        "Marina: What is going on?",
        "Mallet: Nothing, just nothing. Just don't be looking for trouble.",
        "Dinah: You know, I think it's always a good idea that a woman stays on top of things. I'm very clear about how things work between a man and a woman, and in fact, it has inspired me to have a new topic for my show. How to spot a cheater.",
        "Mallet: Because you've got the eye, right?",
        "Dinah: Well, I think that some women choose to see what they want to see, and then I see what I don't want to see and just shoot it.",
        "Ashlee: That's good.",
        "Mallet: That sounds like a winner. I hope your show's on long enough to actually air it.",
