        "Gus: What?",
        "Harley: No, I am not taking another step.",
        "Gus: I'm going to show you...",
        "Harley: I'm not taking another step. We just ran from the cops. We are the cops.",
        "Gus: Kind of funny, isn't it?",
        "Harley: No. What did you do now?",
        "Gus: I'm going to show you, okay? In a second. Do you love me? I love you.",
        "Harley: Sometimes.",
        "Gus: Come on. (Knocks on the door)",
        "Lara: Hi.",
        "Gus: Hi, Lara.",
        "Harley: Lara, huh?",
        "Gus: How is she doing?",
        "Harley: She who?",
        "Lara: She's been an angel.",
        "Harley: Enough of the mystery. I'm not enjoying this.",
        "Gus: Shhh. You'll wake her.",
        "Harley: You didn't.",
        "Lara: Your baby is beautiful, Mrs. Aitoro.",
        "Gus: Lara, thank you so much. We're going to be able to handle it from here, so... I can't tell you how much I appreciate it.",
        "Lara: Oh, I was running low on formula, so...",
        "Gus: Yeah, yeah. I'm at the store. That's cool. Are we cool? Are we even? Yeah, sure? Thank you so much.",
        "Harley: My God, you kidnapped a baby.",
        "Gus: \"Kidnapped.\" That's such a harsh word, don't you think?",
        "Harley: We'll take her back.",
        "Gus: Where exactly would you like me to take her back to, her dead grandmother's house or her parent's prison cell?",
        "Harley: You know what we'll do? We'll tell them that you were in some weird drug-induced haze. No, we can't say that. That will make things worse.",
        "Gus: Babe, listen to me, please.",
        "Harley: Or you got hit with a hammer in the head. When you were fixing the house, a hammer fell on your head. Didn't a hammer fall on your head?",
        "Gus: Before you turn your back... we turn our back on her, can you just take a look at that face. Please? She could be ours.",
        "Harley: Nobody is out there, thank God.",
        "Gus: Please, you kidding me? I've been dodging people for feels like 24 hours.",
        "Harley: We're not keeping her! We can't.",
        "Gus: Says who?",
        "Harley: The law, that little thing that you broke.",
        "Gus: Fine. You know what, that's fine with me. Let her go to foster homes and bounce around from stranger to stranger. Is that what you want?",
        "Harley: It's not up to me! Gosh, she's cute. Are you sleepy. I think she's sleepy. Look at her. Aw.",
        "Gus: She's probably hungry. You can't not feed her.",
        "Harley: Are you hungry? Is that all there is?",
        "Gus: That's all I got. I mean, you have no idea how much running around I was doing. Look. Who's that? Who is that? That's Harley. Yes, that's Harley. You recognize her? I know she dresses so cute. Yeah, she smells good. Yes, she does.",
        "Harley: Nice try. You're going to have to work a little harder than that. We're police officers, we're sworn to uphold the law. No matter how cute and cuddly you are. Nothing personal.",
        "Gus: Can we just keep her? Please. Look at her.",
        "Harley: She is not a puppy that followed you home, Gus. You could go to jail.",
        "Gus: I'm not going to jail. Please.",
        "Harley: What planet are you on? Haven't you gotten into enough trouble this year already? Are you willing to risk everything again? I don't want to raise Zach and Jude by myself.",
        "Gus: Shh.",
        "Harley: Gosh, you're cute. The poor child is starving. Is that all you have?",
        "Gus: Well, let's feed her. Yes, that's all I got. I'll go to the store.",
        "Harley: No, don't go to the store. Just watch her for a second.",
        "Gus: Who are you calling?",
        "Harley: I'm calling Frank.",
        "Gus: You're going to call Frank, the Chief of Police? I don't think it's a very good time to be calling Frank.",
        "Harley: It's my brother. Hey, if I call him now, he could give you a reduced sentence. You could do ten years instead of 20. Hi, Simmons, it's Harley. Can you get Frank for me, please? I know that you want a baby, so do I, but not this way, Gus.",
        "Gus: Well, this is the only way for us.",
        "Harley: What have we been doing for the last few months?",
        "Gus: You don't understand.",
        "Harley: Honey, sometimes it just takes a while, that's all.",
        "Gus: Yeah, sometimes. You're not listening to me. Could you sit down for a second, please? This is... about that secret that Blake knew about me that I didn't even know. Yes, yes...",
        "Harley: The one you were dropping.",
        "Gus: And I didn't, and I'm sorry, and I lied. But I couldn't help myself, okay? And I had to find out.",
        "Harley: And?",
        "Gus: It's about one of the first missions that I had at the Bureau. There were complications.",
        "Harley: Tell me.",
        "Gus: They tell me that I was compromised. (Knock on the door)",
        "Security: Hotel security.",
        "Harley: Yes?",
        "Security: We had complaints about your baby's crying.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Baby crying)",
        "Gus: Listen to me. (Baby crying) Wait, no, no, no. You're going to have a little meal first, okay? And we're going to keep you warm. I know.",
        "Harley: Okay. Okay, if I'm going to be a fugitive cop, I deserve to know why. What were the complications from the case you were working on?",
        "Gus: All right. This is a little difficult for me.",
        "Harley: Uh-huh.",
        "Gus: The Oklahoma land rush, okay?",
        "Harley: You were working in Oklahoma.",
        "Gus: This is like in the 1800s. The covered wagons are going across the rugged terrain, they're trying to get to Oklahoma City, whatever, to get the best piece of land. The best piece, right? But halfway in the journey, they all get to, like, a cliff and they all fall off and plummet to their death. They never make it to the land.",
        "Harley: Huh?",
        "Gus: Let me put it in a way that you'll understand. There is a huge sale at Egan's, right?",
        "Harley: Really? What are we doing here?",
        "Gus: No. That's not true. Just follow the story. There is a huge sale at Egan's, and all the people are waiting outside for the front doors to open so they can get into the sale area. And the doors open, but all the people run in, and what happens? They get sidetracked off to the towel and the sheet area. They never make it to the sale area.",
        "Harley: First of all, when a huge department store has a sale, there's not a sale section. Everything is on sale.",
        "Gus: The Olympic swim team are getting ready for the 100 meter freestyle. They all dive into the water, they're swimming like crazy, they're swimming like mad, but they never make it to the finish line. They all died. They all drowned. They never get a gold medal.",
        "Harley: You have completely lost it.",
        "Gus: The swimmers never make it to the finish line.",
        "Harley: Hey, are you sure?",
        "Gus: Yeah, I'm pretty positive.",
        "Harley: It doesn't matter. I love you. And you are a great dad to Zach and Jude. And we can always adopt.",
        "Gus: I love those boys. I couldn't love them anymore if they were my own. I saw you holding Sydney. And I saw that look on your face. And to me, that was like a sign from God. So...",
        "Harley: Taking her was not a good choice, Gus.",
        "Gus: What, she should go off to some foster house, some cruddy, cruddy foster house?",
        "Harley: They're not all cruddy. Not all of them are cruddy, okay?",
        "Gus: Just excuse me for a second. Why should she even maybe go to some foster home if she could go to us?",
        "Harley: Because there are channels that you go through. There is paperwork that you fill out.",
        "Gus: We're not rules people. We don't do rules and we don't do tour buses. Remember, we always said...",
        "Harley: No, we bend rules, but we don't break them into a million pieces.",
        "Gus: Would you please tell her yourself, little Sydney... please, can you explain this to her?",
        "Harley: Don't do that. Don't put words in her mouth because you want this so badly.",
        "Gus: What, you don't want it? The way I look at it, she is material evidence. In a crime, she's material evidence that we gotta keep from getting tainted or corrupted or lost in the system, the scufflebutt.",
        "Harley: Uh-huh. Keep going. Boy, you could spin anything. No wonder this kid is crazy about you.",
        "Gus: I love this kid. I don't know why, but I do. And I love you, ma.",
        "Harley: I am not her mother. But it does kind of seem like she was meant to find us, doesn't it?",
        "Gus: That's exactly what happened. She found us.",
        "Harley: They're never going to let us keep her. Unless you can think up something really big to make it happen.",

        "Dinah: Welcome to \"Light On Springfield,\" the show that seeks out real stories about real people, and finds the amazing in everyday life. I'm Dinah Marler, and you might recognize me as a former Spaulding executive, or the daughter of the late mayor, or a woman with a certain checkered past. All true, but what you may not know about me is that I was adopted. And every adoptive story is different and unique. And the story that I'm going to bring you here today, that's going to be no different. It will speak to your heart and it will help you stand up and cheer for some real-life heroes. I have here with me Gus Aitoro and Harley Cooper, both highly decorated detectives from the Springfield Police Department. They're here today with me to share their story.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ashlee: I'm sorry, we're taping.",
        "Frank: Good for you, Ashlee, but we're the police.",
        "Ashlee: But if you interrupt this interview, I could get fired from the best job I've ever had. And I only have two more. And is this how the department treats the youth of Springfield?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: So how did you come to find baby Sydney?",
        "Gus: Well, we were raiding a drug dealer's home and the dealer slipped out the window and just left the baby in the apartment. This amazing little girl.",
        "Harley: We removed her from the home, and she was placed with her grandmother. And unfortunately, her grandmother passed away recently.",
        "Gus: We didn't want to see the baby lost in the system.",
        "Harley: No, we felt like we could give her a good home. We love her.",
        "Gus: We fell in love with the child the minute we laid eyes on her.",
        "Dinah: But as cops, you are bound to hand over the child to social services? Wouldn't anybody be?",
        "Gus: See, I'm the one who dragged my wife into this. But she fell in love with the child as soon as she laid eyes on her as well.",
        "Dinah: And you were aware that were breaking the law at the time, correct?",
        "Harley: Sometimes you need to do what is in the best interest of the child.",
        "Dinah: And that would be the baby living with you?",
        "Harley: Yes, definitely. Maybe we were wrong...",
        "Gus: Maybe we don't have the right to ask, but all we really want to do is give the child a home.",
        "Harley: All we want to do is give her a home that has other siblings, brothers and cousins and aunts and uncles and a crazy grandpa.",
        "Gus: And a mother and a father that just want to give this child the world. That's all we're trying to do here.",
        "Dinah: I know that a home like that is difficult to find, but I wish the both of you the very best. And I want to thank you for sharing your story. One family asking for the right to be just that, a family. As the light shines on Springfield, let's remember that the light is really in all of us. See you next week. Bye-bye. That was great, you guys. I think we got some good stuff. You, too, pumpkin.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: She's just a little girl.",
        "Frank: I saw the interview.",
        "Harley: Thanks for not interrupting.",
        "Frank: Well, don't thank me just yet.",
        "Gus: Frank, this is my fault, she really has nothing to do with this. I pulled her into this.",
        "Harley: Uh-uh. We do everything together. That's not true.",
        "Dinah: Chief Cooper, are you arresting them?",
        "Frank: Dinah, this is official police business. Okay, this is none of your business.",
        "Dinah: I believe my viewers have the right to know.",
        "Frank: Are you taping this? Excuse me, can you turn this thing off?",
        "Dinah: Keep rolling, Doug.",
        "Frank: I'm not the bad guy here. Sis, you can't go around taking kids, regardless of the situation. Are you still taping? I told you to turn that thing off. Let's take this outside.",
        "Dinah: Are you going to take the cameras away, Frank? Is that what happens? Is that how you run your police department?",
        "Frank: Ms. Marler, I'm sworn to uphold the law, and so are my detectives.",
        "Harley: What is it you think we're trying to do here, Frank?",
        "Frank: You're not being rational. What about your children, Zach and Jude? You want to be separated from them again?",
        "Harley: What do you think?",
        "Frank: I would like you to make a sound judgement for once, okay?",
        "Harley: You don't think that trying to putting a beautiful little baby in a safe home is sound judgment?",
        "Frank: That's not going to work. Not on me and not on any judge.",
        "Ashlee: So what you're saying is the law is heartless? No wonder why my mom likes her job so much.",
        "Frank: You know what, enough of this three-ring circus. Let's go.",
        "Gus: Frank, we'll go. But let me ask you something. Haven't you ever done something spur of the moment because you felt it was the right thing to do?",
        "Frank: That's not the point.",
        "Gus: I think it is, I think it's exactly the point.",
        "Frank: You know what, Gus. We all want to be heroes, but unfortunately we can't save everybody. Okay.",
        "Gus: But how about just one little girl?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Hey, has anybody working on their Christmas list?",
        "Zach: I sent mine to Santa.",
        "Gus: Is that right? Where did you get the address? Where did you send it, the North Pole?",
        "Zach: I want to get my electric bike, racing bike.",
        "Gus: I know. You keep saying that. Why can't you have something a little smaller, like a bb gun?",
        "Zach: I don't want to shoot my eye out.",
        "Gus: Where do you get this stuff from? You've been talking to your mom?",
        "Zach: You think we're going to get what we want?",
        "Gus: Let me think about that. You've been pretty good. You've been so good you actually might get something early this year.",
        "Zach: Like a kick boxing trainer?",
        "Gus: No, not a kickboxing trainer. Something smaller.",
        "Zach: How about air hockey set?",
        "Gus: Is that smaller? I said smaller. Something more contained... close your eyes, close your eyes.",
        "Zach: It's not Christmas yet.",
        "Gus: Close them! Close them. Nope, nope. Okay, open them.",
        "Zach: Tracey!",
        "Harley: Actually, it's Sydney. That's her real name. And she's going to be staying with us for a little while, if that's okay with you guys.",
        "Jude: Why?",
        "Harley: Come over here into my office. I want to talk to you.",
        "Gus: Come on over here. Sit down.",
        "Harley: You sit here. You know that story from Sunday school about little baby Jesus needing a place to be born. This is sort of the same thing. Sydney needs a place to live.",
        "Zach: Where is her mom and dad?",
        "Harley: They're away. They're away, and they couldn't take care of her. But we can. We can take care of her. We can give her a nice home, we can give her lots and lots of love, and if a judge says it's okay, maybe she'll stay with us for good.",
        "Jude: Cool.",
        "Harley: And you know what, that would make you a big brother. Just like Zach. And you'll be a great big brother. Don't you think?",
        "Gus: Of course he would be. (Phone ringing) Spill it.",
        "Frank: Hey, you guys, I've got good news. You can hold onto Sydney for now.",
        "Gus: We can hold onto Sydney.",
        "Frank: Listen, it is pending a hearing, so the judge still needs to sign off on it.",
        "Gus: There's going to be a hearing first. A hearing.",
        "Harley: Did you hear that?",
        "Gus: Okay, what about me, Frank? Do I have to do, you know, do any jail time?",
        "Frank: Oh, you owe me big time. As a matter of fact, come spring, I want my lawn mowed at least two times a week.",
        "Gus: Well, see, the problem there, Frank, is I'm allergic to grass. I have allergies.",
        "Frank: Too bad.",
        "Gus: Thank you. You really came through for us, Frank.",
        "Frank: Listen, there is one stipulation, though.",
        "Gus: There's a stipulation. What is the stipulation?",
        "Frank: Before the judge hears your case, they want to send a social worker out to your house and check out your living situation. You okay with that, right?",
        "Gus: Frank, are you kidding me. We would love to have somebody check out how we're living. I say bring it on. Yeah. Well, we're in deep doo-doo.",
        "Harley: This is a waste of time.",
        "Gus: I think the place looks so much better. There is nothing else we can do. We're doing everything we can do. (Things falling all over the place)",
        "Harley: We have lawn furniture in our living room-- lawn furniture.",
        "Gus: We are in a transitional phase, okay, in a new house.",
        "Harley: Do you know how long we have been in this transitional phase?",
        "Gus: We have children, all right? We have jobs. We got things. We have a lot of responsibilities and things.",
        "Harley: We have lots of things because we can't get anything done.",
        "Gus: Can I ask you something? You've just got to keep on point. You've got to have vision. Do you see this house? I'm talking to you. You have to have vision.",
        "Harley: Let's hope our friendly neighborhood social worker has that same vision.",
        "Gus: She better have vision. This is damn fine house, a damn fine house.",
        "Harley: It's a fine house. It's my dream house. I'm just saying... I'm just saying I wish that my furniture didn't have cup holders.",
        "Gus: What's wrong with cup holders?",
        "Harley: Honey?",
        "Gus: Yeah?",
        "Harley: Are we getting a sink in the bathroom?",
        "Gus: Yes, that's coming. But it's on backorder.",
        "Harley: She's here!",
        "Gus: She's not here. I can see who it is. It's your brother, Frank. Calm down. Calm down.",
        "Frank: Gus, I hope you have a good pair of hedge trimmers, buddy. Do me a favor, give pop a hand. He's got a bad back.",
        "Gus: Sure.",
        "Harley: What is this? How did you know?",
        "Frank: The last time I had dinner over here I sat on a pillow.",
        "Buzz: Where would you like this?",
        "Harley: In here. Furniture!",
        "Gus: You want me to do it?",
        "Frank: It's perfect.",
        "Gus: You all right?",
        "Frank: Yeah.",
        "Gus: I'll get the pillows.",
        "Frank: All right, it looks good.",
        "Buzz: You know, you two, for people who say they don't like boys... oh, hey, hey, hey, where is she?",
        "Zach: Come look at our baby sister.",
        "Buzz: Oh, I saw you on TV. I love you already. Easy, easy.",
        "Harley: Isn't this your new couch?",
        "Frank: Don't worry about it. Just don't spill anything on it.",
        "Harley: (Laughs)",
        "Gus: Spill anything? What, like grape juice?",
        "Harley: Look at this. It looks good, huh?",
        "Gus: It looks good. It feels good. Yeah. We got ourselves a nice couch.",
        "Harley: We got a couch.",
        "Frank: Listen, brother, don't get comfortable. Give me a hand. I need your help. Come on outside.",
        "Gus: Mama-mia.",
        "Marina: Help!",
        "Harley: Hey, what do you have?",
        "Marina: Stuff to make this house look a little more homey.",
        "Harley: Waxed fruit.",
        "Marina: Classy, right? And the antique store charges a fortune for that stuff. And... actually, you know what, that's grandpa's, he's been looking everywhere for that.",
        "Harley: We shouldn't look that then.",
        "Marina: We can't.",
        "Harley: Look, my old bowling trophy.",
        "Marina: Actually, that's mine. I think yours burnt up. But I took off the nameplate.",
        "Harley: Oh, you're the best.",
        "Marina: No, you're the best. Actually, that little kid is the best. She found you guys. Where is she?",
        "Harley: She's in there.",
        "Marina: Oh! I am your big cousin.",
        "Buzz: Don't jinx it.",
        "Marina: All right, girlie, we've got some rules here, all right? Us girls, we got to stick together, because the guys in this family, really sweet, but a little clueless. No offense. Have you met Coop? Anyway, I'm going to be the cool older cousin who takes you cool places and teaches you how to put on your makeup. And we're going to have a lot of fun.",
        "Frank: All right, sis, you've got a coffee table. Hello.",
        "Gus: Look who I found, my very own brother.",
        "Frank: Any way we can send him back?",
        "Gus: He's a grown man.",
        "Alan-Michael: That's from me and Alex. She saw you on TV and figured you might need it.",
        "Harley: Thank you.",
        "Alan-Michael: It was just collecting dust in the basement, and Lizzie's kid is never going to use it, so...",
        "Buzz: Hey, Frank, check out the baby.",
        "Frank: Would you quit flirting and come over here and help me, please.",
        "Harley: Could you believe this?",
        "Gus: Yeah, I'm starting to believe that they always come through.",
        "Harley: This is starting to feel like a real home.",
        "Gus: And it smells like one, too.",
        "Harley: Is that what that is?",
        "Rick: Ding, dong. It looks like a few of us had the same idea. This is for you, madam.",
        "Harley: You got these for us.",
        "Rick: Why do you say it like that?",
        "Harley: Nothing, it just... must have cost you a lot of money. They're nice.",
        "Rick: Harley, I'm a doctor. Money's no object. I didn't get a chance to sign that...",
        "Gus: \"Dear, Meg: Here's to your speedy recovery. Love, Virgil.\"",
        "Harley: You stole this from the hospital?",
        "Rick: Meg didn't like the flowers.",
        "Harley: Did she die?",
        "Rick: It was so peaceful.",
        "Harley: I'll get a vase.",
        "Rick: They were going to throw them out.",
        "Harley: Here.",
        "Frank: Nice flowers.",
        "Gus: Nice couch, Frank.",
        "Frank: That's what uncles are for. For the record, what you did was really stupid.",
        "Gus: Yeah, I know.",
        "Frank: I remember when Marina was that age. I finally stopped being afraid to pick her up. I always thought I was going to crush her or something.",
        "Gus: I'm not sure I'm much better at it.",
        "Frank: You seem to be doing okay to me.",
        "Buzz: Hey.",
        "Harley: Hey.",
        "Buzz: Great kid.",
        "Harley: That she is.",
        "Buzz: You nervous?",
        "Harley: Um, I was, but not anymore. Aren't you supposed to be away?",
        "Buzz: Oh, I saw a promo on Dinah's show and I thought I should get back here a little earlier. Since I'm going to have a new granddaughter, I should be around, maybe. (Knock on the door)",
        "Harley: Oh, she's here!",
        "Gus: You ready?",
        "Harley: I was born ready.",
        "Gus: All right, good. She is here, okay? Now, we are a typical, normal, American family. Act normal!",
        "Ms. Stone: Hello, I'm Ms. Stone from social services.",
        "Gus: Hi, there, Ms. Stone. I'm Gus Aitoro. And this is my wife, Mrs. Aitoro.",
        "Harley: Please, come in.",
        "Gus: Yes, come on in.",
        "Ms. Stone: I see you're still doing some work.",
        "Gus: Yeah, it's a new house.",
        "Ms. Stone: So I gathered.",
        "Buzz: Harley and Gus designed the house themselves, with children in mind, actually. Oh, I'm Buzz, I'm Harley's father.",
        "Harley: I'm sorry, that's my fault. I should have made the introductions. That's my dad.",
        "Ms. Stone: No need.",
        "Gus: So there's a lot to do, but not really. I can give you a tour of the upstairs or...",
        "Harley: Oh, sorry.",
        "Ms. Stone: Is this thing charged?",
        "Harley: No, no, I wouldn't say it's charged.",
        "Gus: Who was using this thing? Rick, what did I say...",
        "Rick: I know, you told me to put it away.",
        "Linda: Your house seems to be rather time consuming.",
        "Harley: No, I wouldn't say that.",
        "Marina: Actually what Harley and Gus forgot to tell you was that this whole thing has been a real family effort. Even the kids have been involved in constructing this house. You know what I always say: It's never too young to learn some carpentry skills. Detective Marina Cooper.",
        "Ms. Stone: A construction site is no place for a child. All these electrical outlets need to be covered.",
        "Harley: I'm on that.",
        "Ms. Stone: And all the cabinets and drawers need to have childproof locks put on them. Mr. Aitoro.",
        "Gus: I'm taking care of that. That's something I'm taking care of.",
        "Rick: Um, I'm the family doctor. Dr. Frederick Bauer, but Linda, you can just call me Rick. And I can assure you, if there is an accident or mishap around here, I may have had something to do with it. (Laughing) That's a very nice suit you have on.",
        "Ms. Stone: I know your wife, Dr. Bauer, and I'm aware of your situation.",
        "Rick: That's not good.",
        "Ms. Stone: Does the baby have her own room, or is it currently being occupied by your houseguest?",
        "Harley: Oh, Rick is only here temporarily. We have plenty of room for friends and for children. And we have our own room, which is fabulous, and has a Jacuzzi tub which is fabulous. After you've had these really long 12 hour days-- which I never have because I'm always home with the children, but I guess that doesn't really answer your question. Yes, right, the baby will have her own room absolutely.",
        "Ms. Stone: This... this is an accident waiting to happen.",
        "Gus: I wouldn't-- whoa-- touch that.",
        "Harley: Oh, my gosh. Step back. Give her some air.",
        "Rick: Let me take a look at that.",
        "Ms. Stone: Kindly remove your hand from there, Dr. Bauer.",
        "Rick: Sorry, my bad.",
        "Harley: Rick... are you all right?",
        "Ms. Stone: Yes, I'm fine. It was just a little shock.",
        "Harley: I know how that feels. Are you feeling any different? Do you feel normal?",
        "Ms. Stone: Different?",
        "Harley: Her eyes look normal.",
        "Ms. Stone: My eyes?",
        "Frank: What's up with the power?",
        "Harley: Where have you been?",
        "Frank: Washing my hands. I got some grease on them. Linda?",
        "Ms. Stone: Frank. Cooper, this is your family.",
        "Frank: Yes, it is, on good days.",
        "Harley: You guys know each other?",
        "Ms. Stone: From work mostly, but also from the Springfield Beautification Board. We both sit on it.",
        "Frank: It's part of the job, so...",
        "Ms. Stone: I rather enjoy it.",
        "Frank: So, how are you? Did you ever find that new apartment?",
        "Ms. Stone: Good, thanks. No, still looking.",
        "Frank: You know what, I might be able to help you out with that. I overheard one of the guys at the station talking about a place. If you like, I can look into it and give you a call.",
        "Linda: Oh, I'll look forward to it.",
        "Frank: What do you think of my sister and brother-in-law's place, it's nice, right?",
        "Ms. Stone: Very nice. All right, I think I have everything I need.",
        "Gus: But can you tell... any idea, what the report, what it's going to say.",
        "Harley: We're not prying, of course. We're just curious if there's any...",
        "Ms. Stone: This is hardly a perfect family, and it is certainly no one's idea of a perfect home.",
        "Marina: Hey, that's not fair.",
        "Ms. Stone: But who the hell needs perfection? I look for real families. Real homes with real love. And that's exactly what you have here. Which is why I'm going to recommend you be appointed legal guardian. (Cheers and applause)",
        "Frank: Yeah!",
        "Gus: Yeah!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Did you see your father with the little one?",
        "Harley: Yes, he loves to baby-sit. But let's not get our hopes up, okay?",
        "Gus: Hm. Still, but you should feel good about it, you know?",
        "Harley: I do. I feel like we got past our first hurdle.",
        "Gus: I think it's like the third or the fourth hurtle.",
        "Harley: And now the judge is like the fifth hurtle.",
        "Harley: And I need you to do something for me. I need you to turn on that charm of yours. And she'll bang her gavel, and voila, we'll have our little baby.",
        "Gus: Don't you doubt it. And little Sydney will be ours.",
        "Harley: Perfect little family and perfect little dream.",
        "Gus: I'm starting to think that maybe it wasn't in the cards for us to have our own child. Then little Sydney came alone and it was like a blessing from God and you go with it. And I could have a chance to be a good father, prove that with her.",
        "Harley: No, you've already proven that. To Zach and Jude you've proven that.",
        "Mel: Hey guys, you ready?",
        "Harley: Yes, yes. Ready to rock and roll. Which judge do we draw?",
        "Mel: Judge Joseph Green.",
        "Gus: Mean Joe Green?",
        "Mel: Do you know him?",
        "Gus: I kind of rubbed him up the wrong way when I first came to town.",
        "Harley: Are you serious? Are you messing with me? Great, honey.",
        "Mel: Guys, you never know. It's okay.",
        "Clerk: Mr. And Mrs. Aitoro, there has been a change.",
        "Harley: Is the judge ready for us?",
        "Gus: What kind of change?",
        "Ms. Stone: Judge Green isn't feeling well.",
        "Clerk: Judge Reynolds will be sitting in.",
        "Gus: Terrible.",
        "Harley: Must be the clams.",
        "Gus: What is taking so long?",
        "Harley: I don't know. How about those questions she asked? I thought she was supposed to be the nice judge.",
        "Gus: I guess she was just being thorough.",
        "Harley: What difference does it make how many times I've been married?",
        "Gus: Well, I don't know, it doesn't make any difference I think.",
        "Harley: Okay, so three of them were brothers, what's your point?",
        "Gus: That it's a little weird.",
        "Harley: I know other people who have done it.",
        "Gus: Sure, in the Midwest. The questions kept coming and coming.",
        "Harley: Oh, you mean like your drug use?",
        "Gus: I was expecting that.",
        "Harley: And you overcame it, and there is nothing to be ashamed of. And I think she should have accepted your answers!",
        "Gus: What is taking so long? What is taking so long?",
        "Harley: Honey, get some patience.",
        "Gus: What are you talking about patience? We're exactly the same.",
        "Harley: We are. We're like a couple of mutts, you and me.",
        "Gus: Mutts.",
        "Harley: The reality is, mutts live longer. That's a fact.",
        "Gus: Don't I know it.",
        "Harley: Maybe that little Sydney, she's a mutt, too.",
        "Gus: She's exactly like a little mutt. Which is why we should all be together like a little mutt family.",
        "Harley: A mutt family. But honey, if it turned out she wasn't a mutt...",
        "Gus: If it doesn't work out today, we will appeal this thing all the way to the supreme court, okay?",
        "Harley: I'm kind of turned on.",
        "Mel: Congratulations. You're bringing home a beautiful baby girl.",
        "Gus: Is she ours?",
        "Mel: Yes. But you're still only the guardians. Adoption is a very long process, and Judge Green could take over the case again. But you've got her.",
        "Gus: She's going to be ours. Hey, kiddo. (Baby crying) We'll take you home. I know it's been a tough day. (Baby crying)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Huh, huh?",
        "Harley: How did you know?",
        "Buzz: We planned for the best. (Cheers and applause)",
        "Harley: Grandpa, make a toast.",
        "Buzz: Oh, no, no, not me. That goes to this gentleman here. He gets the honors.",
        "Gus: I don't really think I can, Buzz.",
        "All: Speech!",
        "Gus: All right, okay. First of all, I want you to know that Harley and I obviously want to thank you very much, our friends and family for being there for us, and pitching in and giving us all that love when things weren't looking that good. And I don't know, little Sydney is very lucky, she's lucky to have a couple of little brothers like Zach and Jude who are going to walk her to school. And Buzz, you can teach her how to cook and maybe read. And Frank, you can teach her how to drive. No, scratch that. Just ride a bicycle. And little Sydney, I guess if what they say is true about a village... you know, it takes a village. If that's true that it takes a village, well, then Sydney has come to the right village. Cheers, everybody.",
        "All: Here, here.",
        "Gus: Here's to Sydney!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: We should probably let these guys sleep down here, don't you think? Too many paint fumes upstairs.",
        "Gus: How much do you think Harvard costs?",
        "Harley: Well, by the time these two are graduating and it's her turn, we will already have sold the house and all of our possessions and moved in with your father.",
        "Gus: I was just thinking, you know, out loud that they really all deserve the best.",
        "Harley: Aitoro?",
        "Gus: Hmm?",
        "Harley: You know, you're whole covered wagons that never made it across the plain, and the swimmers that didn't make it across the pool, that doesn't matter. Because you're my hero, and I love you. (Baby crying) And you need to get used to that sound.",
        "Gus: The joys of matrimony. Now that's a good sound. Watch this. All right. Look at that. Look at that, baby Sydney. You see the moon? And the stars? Those are your stars. And the whole crazy world, that's yours, okay?",
        "Harley: I don't think she wants the moon, I think she wants a bottle.",
        "Gus: You think so? And if you want to cry, that's okay. You can cry if you want to. Believe me, I know the feeling. You're not alone. You're not alone. We'll be here. We'll always be here.",
