        "Blake: Ooh, ooh, Mel, Mel listen, one quick question, okay?",
        "Mel: You haven't heard from him all day?",
        "Blake: Mel, I'm just looking for Rick.",
        "Mel: Oh. Okay. No, thank you.",
        "Blake: I'm sorry.",
        "Mel: What's the problem?",
        "Blake: I'm looking for Rick. I can't find him anywhere.",
        "Mel: Join the club.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Fifteen seconds to go, Spaulding up by two. No, he's up by one. Bauer's got the ball. Ten, eight, six, this is for the championship! Four, two. One. Good to go!",
        "Beth: (Makes Buzzer sound) No good, game's over.",
        "Rick: How'd you know I was here?",
        "Beth: I didn't. World championship, huh? Phillip's winning?",
        "Rick: Yeah. I don't know, I thought if I let him win, he might come back. It's worth a shot, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Well, I bet Buzz is going to feel a heck of a lot better after he sees you, right? Honey, what's the hold up? Hey, what's the matter? What, what's wrong? What, the decorations? It's just Christmas decorations. Look. It's a Christmas tree. It means Christmas is coming up real soon. We're going to have a lot of fun this Christmas.",
        "Robbie: It can't be Christmas if Mommy isn't here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Sebastian? Sebastian! This is great.",
        "Holly: Not crazy about it myself.",
        "Michelle: For all we know, he could have left us in here to die.",
        "Holly: Welcome to my world.",
        "Michelle: It's been over 24 hours since he locked us in this kennel!",
        "Holly: Michelle, Sebastian is sick. He is extremely sick. I keep telling you that.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, and so is Tony.",
        "Holly: He'll rest more and more. But he'll back because he needs us.",
        "Michelle: He needs his cure.",
        "Holly: He needs us to get to your father, or so he thinks. But be on your guard. This sickness makes him irrational, volatile. Michelle, he's freaking out.",
        "Michelle: Yes! So am I, okay? I am worried about Tony. He is sick. And he needs help. He needs help a lot sooner than Sebastian does. For all we know, Holly, Tony could be dead right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Why are we here? I really don't want to give Lizzie any business.",
        "Sandy: Well, I'm just tired of J. Farley's.",
        "Tammy: Uh, you're tired of running into JB at J. Farley's.",
        "Sandy: Indubitably. Aren't you?",
        "Tammy: Wonder if they have anything good here anymore? What's a Roxy salad?",
        "Sandy: I don't know, some kind of roughage. You know, I've been thinking about doing another play. Would you be interested?",
        "Tammy: No thanks. I feel like everybody's critiquing my performance when I just walk down the street these days.",
        "Sandy: Well, I was thinking more along the lines of writing, not acting.",
        "Tammy: Well, I don't have the talent for that.",
        "Sandy: You never know until you try.",
        "Tammy: When I was little, I used to write these little skits.",
        "Sandy: Well, there you go. A natural inclination, was it fun?",
        "Tammy: It was okay. The cool part was getting into the characters' heads, you know? Figuring out what they would do and say.",
        "Sandy: Well, there you go. You already sound like a playwright.",
        "Tammy: But I was, like, eight or nine.",
        "Sandy: So, keep it simple. Write what you know. Write what you feel. Whatever you think is true and real, put it down on paper.",
        "Tammy: And, if it stinks?",
        "Sandy: Well, then, I'll definitely tell you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: Wait a minute. Are you telling me that Rick changed his work schedule, and he didn't tell you?",
        "Mel: Yeah, it was a surprise to me, too. He's been kind of preoccupied lately.",
        "Blake: Well, that's pretty understandable with everything that's happened.",
        "Mel: Yep, one big drama after the next.",
        "Blake: I don't know. Maybe his cell phone died?",
        "Blake: All right, look. The reason I need to talk to Rick is he treated my brother, Sebastian, here the other night. And I wanted to know if he could fill me in on the details.",
        "Mel: Why not just ask Sebastian?",
        "Blake: He's kind of a hard guy to get in touch with. But, you know, did Rick say anything about that night?",
        "Mel: No. I mean we haven't talked about his caseload lately, or much of anything else.",
        "Blake: Oh, I'm sorry. Well, you know, when you do talk to Rick, will you tell him to please call me?",
        "Mel: I will.",
        "Blake: Mel, I know that things have been tough for Rick since Phillip died.",
        "Mel: Things have been tough all around.",
        "Blake: It's going to get better. Oh, come on.",
        "Mel: I know it will. Yeah. It's just a lot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: So, you're doing that bargaining thing with God? Send Phillip back, and I'll let him win from now on.",
        "Rick: It's not much of a sacrifice, Beth. He usually won most of the time, any ways.",
        "Beth: He liked to win. Guess it caught up with him.",
        "Rick: You know I'd work for him. Worked for him most of the time. He absolutely refused to entertain the idea that he would lose at anything.",
        "Beth: Yeah. Like when Lizzie was sick. Do you remember, he wouldn't let us any of us breathe a word of doubt about her chances. He said that she was going to beat it, and they were going to win together.",
        "Rick: And they won, Beth. How's Lizzie doing?",
        "Beth: At the moment, all she can focus on is doing what she thinks her father would want her do.",
        "Rick: Her father wanted his daughter to be just like you. Well, at one point he did?",
        "Beth: At one point?",
        "Rick: Well, yeah. You know, one point, long time ago, when, you know, he won you over.",
        "Beth: Won me over, huh? You mean, when he beat you out.",
        "Rick: Oh, no.",
        "Beth: Rick come on. I don't think you fought all that hard for me.",
        "Rick: Oh, Beth, please. You guys were a force of nature. I just had to step out of the way so I didn't get caught up in the storm. Besides, you were the only person that made him happy.",
        "Beth: No, that's not true.",
        "Rick: That's true.",
        "Beth: No.",
        "Rick: Yes it is.",
        "Beth: No. You made him happy, too. You were a good friend to him.",
        "Rick: A lot of people didn't see that, Beth. There were so many things that he did for me that I didn't even know about. He really just wanted me to be happy.",
        "Beth: You paid him back. He'd wreak havoc, and you had his back every time, no matter what.",
        "Rick: Yeah. But I don't have to do that now, do I?",
        "Beth: No.",
        "Rick: I don't have to be the reliable steady friend. Maybe it's my turn to wreak a little havoc.",
        "Beth: So is that why you went AWOL today?",
        "Rick: AWOL? I took the afternoon off.",
        "Beth: Yeah, well, you didn't tell your wife. She's been looking for you.",
        "Rick: Oh. I guess that's not very smart, is it?",
        "Beth: No, it's not. Not if you want to hang onto your wife.",
        "Rick: My wife can handle it. In fact, my wife can handle most everything.",
        "Beth: And that makes you a lucky guy. So I suggest, if you want to stay a lucky guy, you call your wife.",
        "Rick: I am a lucky guy. Tell you what. Let's make a deal. I'll tell you what; I'm going to try this jumper that Phillip used to nail me with all the time. If I miss it, I'll take that as a sign that I should go home and talk to my wife. But if I make it, I'll take that as a sign that you should stay here and hang out with me. Okay? Got a deal?",
        "Beth: Rick...",
        "Rick: Great.",
        "Beth: Ah.",
        "Rick: Nothing but net, and plenty of time left on the clock.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Listen, we're going to have a lot of fun this Christmas, okay? It's going to be really special, even if Mommy can't be here for it. Do you believe me?",
        "Marina: Hey. How perfect is this, me bumping into you guys? I have something for you.",
        "Danny: What is that? Something for you?",
        "Marina: I don't know. Absolutely. You know, Santa was here dropping off early Christmas presents for some of the kids in the children's ward, and that one got mixed in with them.",
        "Danny: You're kidding. Well how did that happen?",
        "Marina: You know, I asked Santa the very same thing. And he told me that your Mommy had written to him and asked him to give you this Christmas present. So, he asked me if I could help out and make sure you got it.",
        "Danny: Wow. Well, what do you think it is? What is it?",
        "Marina: I don't know. I couldn't tell you. But, I have a feeling it's something really, really cool. Shake it.",
        "Robbie: It's from my Mommy?",
        "Marina: You bet it is. Santa wouldn't lie.",
        "Danny: See, Mommy wouldn't forget about you. Yeah, Mommy didn't forget. That's pretty cool. All right, shake it, but don't break it. You can't open it until Christmas. Come here. Take a seat. Thanks. That was, uh, that really meant a lot to him. So what is it? I'll replace it.",
        "Marina: Why? It was for him, anyway. I really did save a trip.",
        "Danny: What? That was your present for Robbie?",
        "Marina: Yeah.",
        "Danny: Really. You're going to let Michelle take all the credit for it?",
        "Marina: I don't need the credit. I got what I want. Look at him.",
        "Danny: I owe you one.",
        "Marina: Oh, I do like the idea of Danny Santos owing me.",
        "Danny: Oh yeah? Well, I could start by saying hi to your grandfather.",
        "Marina: He's asleep. I just got back from there.",
        "Danny: How dare he? Doesn't he know how important I am?",
        "Marina: I know. It's incredible, right?",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Marina: So...",
        "Danny: So...",
        "Marina: There's a big empty space in your schedule now.",
        "Danny: Yeah, and the nanny's going to be taking Robbie for the night. This is... it's a major crisis.",
        "Marina: Major crisis. You know, I was thinking of holding that IOU over your head for a long time, but I think I'm going to cash in on it right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Well, it's not like I planned this, Holly, you know. Tony and I, we spent a lot of time together, and we just got closer. And now, he's sick and he needs my help. And he could die. So what kind of sick irony is that, huh?",
        "Holly: Yeah, there's a lot of that going around. So, how are you feeling?",
        "Michelle: Who cares. Open the damn door!",
        "Sebastian: I take it you've brought Michelle up to speed.",
        "Michelle: Yes, she's filled me in on your health issues.",
        "Sebastian: That's a delicate way of putting it. I am fully prepared to set you free.",
        "Michelle: As long as I bring my father to you, is that right?",
        "Sebastian: Mm-hmm, yeah. You bring me the cure, and you're on your way home. Or wherever you and Tony decide to go, into the sunset, maybe.",
        "Holly: Well, Tony may not last to the next dawn if he doesn't get some help.",
        "Sebastian: I don't care whether he does or not. I'm the one who needs to survive. Me. I'm the man who has the key to your cage.",
        "Michelle: I don't think that's true. Because I think your life depends on us. So therefore, I hold the key.",
        "Sebastian: What is this? Let's make a deal?",
        "Michelle: Yeah. And here's the deal. You take us to where Tony is.",
        "Sebastian: You are in no position to bargain with me, Michelle.",
        "Michelle: And give me all the medicine that he might need. And then I will call my father, and not a minute sooner.",
        "Sebastian: And how I am supposed to trust you? How do I know you're good at your word?",
        "Michelle: Because I want to live. And you have no other choice.",
        "Sebastian: All right. We leave right away. You're going to stay here.",
        "Holly: Oh. I thought I'd go out for a bite to eat and maybe catch a movie.",
        "Sebastian: Get the medical kit, and bring her out front.",
        "Holly: Be careful when he finds out you don't know how to reach Ed.",
        "Michelle: Well, first thing's first, all right. I've got to save Tony. Once that's done, then I'll work out what's next.",
        "Holly: Okay. Today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Just today, huh?",
        "Rick: Oh you're really funny. You're really funny for a bench warmer over there. So what are you doing here?",
        "Beth: Same thing you are, I guess.",
        "Rick: Phillip?",
        "Beth: I miss him.",
        "Rick: So do I. I miss him a lot. Do you know what's nice, Beth. What's really nice is that I have somebody I can actually admit that to.",
        "Beth: You know I'm actually a little surprised to see you here today. After all that talk about the sailing trip the other day, I half expected that you'd be gone already.",
        "Rick: Well, spontaneity takes a lot of work. Besides, I can't go yet. You haven't told me that you're going to go.",
        "Beth: Rick.",
        "Rick: What?",
        "Beth: I already told you that's something that I shouldn't be a part of. That's an adventure that you and Mel should share. So where are you going, Mr. Spontaneity?",
        "Rick: Around the world.",
        "Beth: Wow. That's going to be some long trip.",
        "Rick: No, Beth, that's the name of a basketball game, around the world. You shoot from different places on the basketball court. I'm going to teach you how to play.",
        "Beth: Me? Oh no, no, no. You've got the wrong person. I'm horrible at basketball. And even if I were the right person, I've got on the wrong shoes.",
        "Rick: I like your shoes. I like your shoes a lot. This is perfect. Finally, a game I can win at.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Waitress: Sandy, there's a call for you. Only phone working is in the kitchen.",
        "Sandy: Okay. Who is it?",
        "Waitress: Didn't give a name. Come on. I'll show you where the phone is.",
        "Sandy: Keep cracking on that one. I'll be right back.",
        "Jonathan: How do you spell manipulate?",
        "Tammy: I don't know. Go look it up. Someplace far away.",
        "Jonathan: Well, maybe sandman can help. That's his specialty, manipulation. Only he calls it helping.",
        "Tammy: Leave me alone.",
        "Jonathan: Sandy wants you bad. The only problem is, you're damaged goods. So he has to fix you before he can take you home, plug you in.",
        "Tammy: Goodbye, JB.",
        "Jonathan: You think what I did to you was terrible? He's turning you into some kind of reclamation project. Like you're some toxic dump he has to clean up before he can get near you.",
        "Tammy: Stop it!",
        "Jonathan: Look, the proof is right here under your nose, honey. It looks like some bad shrink's notebook.",
        "Tammy: What are you talking about?",
        "Jonathan: If you're hurting, write your way through it with a journal, or a play. Work yourself up to a nice respectable breakthrough. Then you can heal and be normal again. Got to be normal again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Whoa. What's with all the trees?",
        "Marina: So, there's a charity that sells Christmas trees to benefit veterans. And grandpa agreed to let them set up shop here.",
        "Danny: Yeah? Did he get little Lizzie's approval, first?",
        "Marina: Listen, I'll deal with boss clue-less. Meantime, we've got a bigger problem on our hands.",
        "Danny: Oh yeah? What?",
        "Marina: Do you see anyone selling the trees?",
        "Danny: Oh. I see where this is going.",
        "Marina: You're the one who said he owed me. Blue spruces start at forty. Pines are thirty.",
        "Danny: Are you really sure you want me doing this?",
        "Marina: Hey, Grandpa says that sales people sell themselves, not the product.",
        "Danny: I ran for office, and you know how that turned out.",
        "Marina: What's the matter, are you scared I'm going to outsell you?",
        "Danny: Oh please. Well, they smell good.",
        "Marina: Robbie's not the only Santos missing a normal Christmas, huh?",
        "Danny: I'm just... it bugs me that Michelle is not going to be here for Christmas, for Robbie's sake. His mother should be a part of it. But she has made her choices and I'm making some of my own.",
        "Marina: Like?",
        "Danny: Like not moping around. Like dealing with what's right in front of me. Like selling twice as many trees as you could ever dream of moving.",
        "Marina: Oh, you're on.",
        "Danny: (Laughs)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Tony? Tony! You had to lock me up! He's gone! Tony! Tony!",
        "Sebastian: More time wasted. Organize a search party.",
        "Michelle: Oh, my God! He's over here! He's over here, and he must have tried to crawl out of the ravine. Tony. Tony? Can you hear me? Tony? Tony, please. Please, can you hear me? Tony.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Hey!",
        "Jonathan: Let's see what kind of head sandman's got you in.",
        "Tammy: Give that back.",
        "Sandy: Hey. You'll never guess who was on the phone when I got back there. Yeah, no one. Now I know why.",
        "Jonathan: I hate when that happens.",
        "Sandy: Right.",
        "Jonathan: What, you think I set up that phone call? Why would I bother? I have no reason to avoid you. The way I see it, it's the other way around.",
        "Sandy: You think?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I do think. I'm the living, breathing reminder to you of how you took the trust of people like Tammy and her mother and her Aunt--and the list goes on and on--and you twisted that trust to get what you wanted. So that's why it kills you to see me. And it will, every time.",
        "Sandy: Right. And it doesn't kill you at all to know that this family, your family, took me in, still cares about me? It doesn't bother you at all that when Reva sees me, she still sees a loving, caring son?",
        "Jonathan: Good luck on the writing, tam-tam.",
        "Sandy: Sorry about that guy. I guess there's no escaping him.",
        "Tammy: No big deal.",
        "Sandy: Well, you want to go back to the apartment? Chinese food, kung fu movies?",
        "Tammy: I'm okay. Let's stay and keep working. I've been thinking. How about this? A girl gets used by a guy--and I mean, totally humiliated--and now she has about a zillion trust issues to deal with.",
        "Sandy: You'd be willing to write about that?",
        "Tammy: It's what I know.",
        "Sandy: Well, I've got to say I think that could be incredibly powerful. I think you could come up with some really visceral, meaningful material.",
        "Tammy: He was right.",
        "Sandy: Who was right?",
        "Tammy: The other night, when I wanted to go to bed with you and you wouldn't do it, you weren't trying to be protective of me. That had nothing to do with you being a nice guy. You just couldn't stand the thought of being with me.",
        "Sandy: What?",
        "Tammy: Oh, no. Can't sleep with me, because I've already been slept with. To you, I'm... how did he put it? I'm damaged goods.",
        "Sandy: Jonathan? Is that what Jonathan says?",
        "Tammy: I'm used. And you're just trying to see if you can clean me up enough to pass inspection.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Come on, Tony. Come on. Come on. Okay, there's a heartbeat. It's weak, but he's alive. Give me the medical kit, quick.",
        "Sebastian: Move out of the way. Where's the bite?",
        "Michelle: It's on his neck. Look. It's right there.",
        "Sebastian: Where?",
        "Marco: This bite is very distinctive, and serious.",
        "Michelle: Okay, I know that it's infected, but is it poisonous?",
        "Marco: Oh, highly.",
        "Sebastian: Yeah, but the poison works slowly. Don't worry, Michelle. There's an antidote.",
        "Michelle: Do you have it? Do you have the antidote? Here, I'll do it. Tony? Come on, Tony. Come on. It's going to be okay. Everything is going to be okay. Come on, Tony. It's me. It's Michelle. Try to open your eyes, okay? Can you open your eyes for me, please? Hey. Hey. It's okay.",
        "Tony: Hey. You came.",
        "Michelle: I told you I would. I keep my promises, you know? You're going to be okay. Don't... no, no, no. Don't try to move. Just lay there, all right?",
        "Tony: Michelle.",
        "Michelle: I'm right here, honey. I'm right here.",
        "Tony: Thank you. Thank you.",
        "Michelle: Shh. Shh. It's going to be okay. Everything is going to be okay.",
        "Sebastian: (Groans)",
        "Marco: Are you all right?",
        "Sebastian: Yeah. Yes, I will be. Soon. Very soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Thank you very much, enjoy your free...",
        "Marina: Two Christmas trees.",
        "Danny: Merry Christmas.",
        "Marina: What a great idea. Twice the Christmas spirit.",
        "Danny: Yes. Check it out. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.",
        "Marina: Go ahead and add two more for me.",
        "Danny: Two?",
        "Marina: Wow. Look at that. I have sold two more trees than you. I told you I have the knack.",
        "Danny: Uh-uh. I think you're cooking the books.",
        "Marina: I am not. I'm winning. Deal with it.",
        "Danny: Okay. I demand a recount.",
        "Marina: Fine!",
        "Danny: Hey, how are you doing? Can I interest you in a nice blue spruce?",
        "Customer #1: That's a kind of tree?",
        "Danny: Sure is. Right here. Check it out?",
        "Marina: Can I help you find a tree?",
        "Customer #2: I don't know. These all look so cut.",
        "Customer #1: I don't think I'm ready to buy.",
        "Danny: Yeah, well... I'll tell you what. Hold on a second. See that girl over there? I wasn't supposed to say anything, but her family, they're near broke. They're practically homeless and if they don't sell all these trees...",
        "Customer #1: I thought the money went to veterans.",
        "Danny: She's an ex-marine.",
        "Customer #2: You know, maybe I'll come back another day.",
        "Marina: I wouldn't do that if I were you. You see that guy over there?",
        "Customer #2: Yeah.",
        "Marina: You recognize him? It's Danny Santos. He was running for mayor; now he's selling Christmas trees. But he's still a Santos, if you know what that means. Listen, I don't mean to scare you or anything, but the other day, he got word that some folks were leaving here to go to another Christmas tree lot and he wasn't pleased. If you catch my drift.",
        "Danny: Come on. I'm telling you, this tree is perfect for you. Just say the magic word, it's yours. I'll put it on your truck, car, whatever.",
        "Customer #1: I need to speak to my husband first.",
        "Customer #2: I just need to talk to my wife. (Weak laughter)",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Yes! Nothing but nothing but net.",
        "Beth: (Laughs) (squeals) (laughs)",
        "Rick: Your turn. Come on, come on.",
        "Beth: I'm going to miss this.",
        "Rick: It's a game. Come on, humiliation is part of it. Let's just go. Shoot. Got to turn that air conditioner off. That was pretty sad. Very sad.",
        "Beth: (Laughs) see? You're as bad as Phillip.",
        "Rick: You know what I think your problem is with your basketball shots? It's not unlike this trip I want you to take with me. You have no follow-through. But I'm going to help you with this little problem.",
        "Beth: Oh, no.",
        "Rick: Yes.",
        "Beth: No.",
        "Rick: Please. Let me show you. Part of it is...",
        "Beth: This is fun. Good fun.",
        "Rick: Look at this. See? That's good for a pageant wave, all right?",
        "Beth: (Laughs)",
        "Rick: Hello? Hello? Thank you for voting me. No, it's not good for a basketball shot, okay? All right, so look at the front of the rim and use your legs. Your legs are your...",
        "Beth: I feel like I'm a mannequin in a sporting goods store window, is what I feel like.",
        "Rick: Don't talk to me that way. It's not going to work.",
        "Beth: (Laughs)",
        "Rick: All right? Look at the front of the rim, use your knees, and after you let go, follow through with the shot, okay?",
        "Beth: Okay.",
        "Rick: And by the way, we're not leaving on this trip until you make it, so there's no pressure.",
        "Beth: Okay.",
        "Rick: Ready? Okay, let it go.",
        "Mel: What trip?",
        "Rick: Hey. Sweetie, what a surprise.",
        "Mel: Yeah, I'm sure it is. You covered your tracks pretty well. I called everybody, even Beth. Nobody seemed to know where you were.",
        "Beth: Mel, I'm sorry. I didn't know...",
        "Rick: That's all right. I wasn't trying to avoid you, honey. I was just taking a break from the hospital, that's all.",
        "Mel: Well, your timing is lousy. Buzz Cooper was admitted.",
        "Rick: Oh, my God. What happened? Did he have another heart attack?",
        "Mel: No, thankfully, but Harley was asking for you.",
        "Rick: I'm sorry, but I don't live at the hospital.",
        "Mel: No. You don't even come around that much anymore.",
        "Beth: Um, I should get going.",
        "Rick: Beth, it's okay. I want you to stay. We're fine. We're fine, right?",
        "Mel: I honestly don't know.",
        "Rick: I asked Fisher to cover for me this afternoon, Mel, because I've been feeling burned out. I'm tired. I feel like my whole life, my whole existence, is nothing but putting on hospital scrubs and treating one patient after another after another, and I'm burned out.",
        "Mel: You are a doctor.",
        "Rick: Do I care about Buzz and my other patients? Absolutely. But it's not all that I am or all that I want to do. I've been trying to explain this to you, but you haven't been listening. I'm just tired and I need a break.",
        "Mel: Look, I understand, okay? But you haven't answered me about the trip.",
        "Rick: I was going to surprise you when the timing was right. I had this idea that we would charter a sailboat, Mel, and literally just let the wind take us away for two months, six months, I don't know how long, but just long enough for us to see the world. I mean... what do you think?",
        "Mel: Well, um, that's quite a bold plan.",
        "Rick: You obviously don't like the idea, do you?",
        "Mel: It just seems a little farfetched now don't you think?",
        "Rick: Why is that?",
        "Mel: Well, hearing the news about Buzz sort of brings you back down to earth, right?",
        "Rick: Actually, no, it doesn't. The truth is, hearing the news about Buzz makes me want to get on that boat first thing in the morning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Customer #3: I'm going to pass on the tree. I'll look for something else.",
        "Marina: Oh. Hey!",
        "Danny: Hey.",
        "Marina: What did you say to him? This is the best tree we've got.",
        "Danny: I know. I don't want to risk losing it. I'm buying it, for Company. So, you know, it'll be a nice surprise for Buzz when he gets out of the hospital. Here. And this is my money.",
        "Marina: This is so sweet. Oh, thank you. Come on, let's get it inside before someone else wants it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Just tell me, Tammy. What did good old Jonathan say?",
        "Tammy: Writing a dumb play isn't going to make sleeping with my own cousin be any better, okay, let alone go away. It's not going to change me. I am what I am. And there's a kind of guy out there who's perfect for someone like me.",
        "Sandy: No. Just listen to me. Just because you slept with this guy once doesn't mean he's the only kind of guy you can ever be with. And maybe it'll take some time to get through this, but it'll happen.",
        "Tammy: You see? All you can talk about is how and when I will be different. Better. You know, maybe I should be with the JB types. At least they won't spend every minute trying to change me.",
        "Sandy: Tammy! You know that's not... excuse me. Sorry. Tammy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: I know Lizzie's a terror, but that was a little extreme, don't you think?",
        "Marina: Very funny. Here. Right over here.",
        "Danny: Yeah? Okay. All right. Looking good. So, listen, thanks for earlier. You know, before you came in and gave Robbie that present, I...",
        "Marina: Yeah.",
        "Danny: Well, I've got to be honest with you, I totally froze. He asked about his Mom and I had no idea what to say.",
        "Marina: You would have been fine.",
        "Danny: Yeah, probably. Probably. But I just wanted to make up an excuse and grab him and take him out of there and take him home. But...",
        "Marina: But?",
        "Danny: But I'm glad I didn't. All right, let's stop standing around. We've got a lot of work to do, here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tony: Ugh. Oh, God, what is that stuff?",
        "Michelle: Just think of it as an electrolyte cocktail, okay?",
        "Sebastian: All right, let's head back.",
        "Michelle: Tony's not well enough to move yet.",
        "Sebastian: I brought you here to Tony and he made it. And now it's your turn, Michelle. You're going to call your father so I can make it. You said you were good to your word, so let's go. Now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mel: I thought hearing the news about Buzz would help you realize that it's not so easy to simply take off.",
        "Rick: No, maybe it's not right, but maybe it's necessary. Mel, after my heart transplant, what was the overriding feeling that we both had? What was it? It was gratitude that I was alive, because I came that close to death--that close --and it can happen again in an instant. In an instant, my life could be taken away, just like that.",
        "Mel: Right, I know. Are you thinking about this because of Phillip?",
        "Rick: Of course I'm thinking, because of Phillip. What else would I be thinking about?",
        "Mel: Honey, nothing is going to happen to you.",
        "Rick: How would my children remember me if I was taken away tomorrow? How would they remember me? They would remember me the way I remember my father, Mel, as a workaholic doctor that was never around. And that's unacceptable to me. Do you understand that? I want my children to know me. I want my children to know who their father is.",
        "Mel: They do know you.",
        "Rick: No, they don't know me!",
        "Mel: They know you. Rick, you can't act out of fear, okay? You can't turn your life upside down because you're afraid you've missed something or will miss it. You haven't. Our life is here in Springfield. Okay? Raising our kids, going to work, that's what we do. It's not you and Phillip and Beth and Mindy in high school. We're all grown up now.",
        "Rick: Thank you, Mel. Thank you for reminding me of the happiest time of my life. I should probably go.",
        "Mel: Rick...",
        "Rick: No, that's all right. I've got responsibilities, remember?",
        "Mel: Rick. Thank you, by the way, for calling me back and letting me know you found him.",
        "Beth: I'm not his mother.",
        "Mel: What are you, exactly?",
        "Beth: I'm his friend. Can you say the same?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Yeah, that's it. Okay. We're set. Did Marina go outside? Hey! What are you doing out here? The tree is ready to be decorated.",
        "Marina: Great. I'm just going through the stuff. You've inspired me. I want to decorate the whole place before Grandpa gets back.",
        "Danny: That's a good idea.",
        "Marina: All kinds of great stuff in here.",
        "Danny: Yeah? Like what?",
        "Marina: Oh, like this.",
        "Danny: Cute.",
        "Marina: And this.",
        "Danny: Uh-huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: Did you miss us?",
        "Holly: Oh, thank God you found him.",
        "Tony: You want me in there, huh?",
        "Michelle: Yeah.",
        "Holly: I didn't really explain to you why I took off.",
        "Sebastian: Why you left me for dead? Don't worry about it. Call it an oversight.",
        "Holly: I had a chance to escape. I'm not a fool. Try and understand.",
        "Sebastian: Oh, I understand. You're feeling guilty. You don't want to feel guilty. But don't expect any help from me.",
        "Holly: I came back for you. Doesn't that tell you anything? Doesn't that mean anything to you?",
        "Sebastian: How is he?",
        "Michelle: He needs to rest.",
        "Sebastian: Yeah? Well, then you don't want to disturb him when you use this. Call your father. Now, Michelle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: It's kind of cheesy, the whole mistletoe thing, huh?",
        "Danny: What thing? What, you mean this thing? It's not so cheesy.",
        "Marina: Maybe not. (Cell phone ringing)",
        "Danny: I'm sorry. It could be the nanny. Sorry. Hello.",
        "Michelle: Dad? Hi. Dad, hi. It's me. It's Michelle. Uh, can you hear me okay? I'm so glad I got through to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Next, on \"Guiding Light\"...",
        "Josh: I assume you have a theory as to who the killer is.",
        "Ruth: Oh, no, dear. I don't have a theory about who the killer is. I don't have a theory at all. I know who it is.",
        "Jonathan: We got in trouble with the police before and now they're looking for us and we need somebody to hide us, no questions. Will you protect us?"
