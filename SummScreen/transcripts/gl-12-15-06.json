        "Jonathan: Well, she won't stop crying, and\r\nher head's hot. ",
        "Reva: Because your hands are freezing. ",
        "Jonathan: Well, also, she's sneezing. I\r\nthink I heard her coughing. ",
        "Reva: I was with her just a little while\r\nago, and she seemed fine. ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, well, she's not fine now. ",
        "Reva: Are you maybe using this all as an\r\nexcuse to not go out tonight so you don't have to see Tammy? ",

        "Reva: I didn't say you were. ",
        "Jonathan: And it's not like maybe I'll run\r\ninto Tammy. The party is at Cassie\u2019s house. I'm pretty sure she's going to be\r\nthere. ",
        "Reva: I'm not so sure. I spoke to her, and\r\nshe knows you're going, so... ",
        "Jonathan: So she doesn't want to run into\r\nme, either. ",
        "Reva: Do you know how much Lizzie\u2019s looking\r\nforward to you taking her out? ",
        "Jonathan: I know. It's not like I want her\r\nto miss out. I want her to be happy. ",
        "Reva: I know you do. I see how hard you're\r\ntrying. But this is all new, so if you're feeling a little... ",

        "Reva: Oh, there's my little bunny. How...\r\nso? ",
        "Lizzie: She's not crying anymore. I don't\r\nknow. Maybe it was normal baby crying. ",
        "Reva: Let me see my little sweet pea. Oh,\r\nthere she is. ",
        "Lizzie: Hi. I will have nana check her out\r\nas soon as she gets here. ",

        "Beth: Because it looks like you could use\r\nthe company. ",
        "Tammy: No, I'm good. ",
        "Beth: I admire you, Tammy. Giving up Jonathan so that he could be with his wife and daughter.\r\nI know it's got to be hard right now. But you have a friend, and her name is\r\nkarma. ",
        "Tammy: (Laughing)\r\nOkay. Beth, I really don't need you to sit here and baby-sit me, okay? I'm not\r\ngoing to go anywhere near that party and I'm not going\r\nto ruin Lizzie\u2019s big night out. ",

        "Tammy: Well, I said \"baby-sit,\"\r\nbut I mean, if you want to be blunt about it... ",
        "Beth: All I want you to know is that your\r\nsacrifice has given Lizzie\u2019s new family a chance. And there is something to be\r\nsaid for taking the high road. ",

        "Beth: Tammy, come on. I'm trying to... ",
        "Tammy: Be threatening? Come on, you married\r\nfor money and power, and then when you realized that that was not a good idea,\r\nyou had an affair and you messed up another family. ",
        "Beth: This isn't about me. ",
        "Tammy: Like mother like daughter. ",
        "Beth: Well, let's hope not. ",

        "Beth: You know what, Tammy... ",
        "Tammy: So you know what? Karma is not my\r\nfriend. Okay, karma kicks me when I am down so that people like you and Lizzie\r\nand step right over me on your way to the top, okay? And I am so over that! ",

        "Lillian: Oh, and how about father in-laws\r\nwho marry their daughter-in-laws? You know, men with a warped sense of right\r\nand wrong have ruled my family for far too long. I paid for it, Beth paid for\r\nit, and Lizzie paid for it, and I am damned if Sarah is going to pay for it. ",
        "Alan: I will not take \"no\" for an\r\nanswer. Do you understand? ",
        "Lillian: I've lived here for quite a long\r\ntime, and I have heard a lot, I have seen a lot, and believe me, I could tell\r\nthe police a lot. ",
