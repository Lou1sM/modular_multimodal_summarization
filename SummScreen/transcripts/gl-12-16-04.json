        "Olivia: Thank you.",
        "Bill: Hey, hey, hey, baby Emma coming through. She got a lot on her mind and someone needs to...(sniffs) ...lighten her load, if you know what I mean.",
        "Olivia: Oh, yeah.",
        "Bill: The nose knows.",
        "Olivia: Well, I'll change her in a second. I thought that you were working late at the office.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, we got a change of plans, don't we? We got a change of plans. I picked up Emma at daycare because she has an appointment with a big man in a red suit.",
        "Olivia: What a great idea. You want to go see Santa Claus?",
        "Bill: Yeah, she does. She does. You want to go sit on Santa's lap? You do. You want to go sit on Santa's lap and then Mommy can sit on my lap and tell me all about the...",
        "Olivia: Stop it. Ssh. Cover your ears. No, it's not. I'm going to go change her and...",
        "Alan: Well, well. Look who's here. Hi, Emma. You want to come give your granddad a big hug? That is, unless your mother has a problem with that.",
        "Olivia: No. Actually, Alan, I think this would be the perfect time to hold her.",
        "Alan: Come to your granddad. Let me hold that girl. Ugh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lillian: There. That better?",
        "Buzz: It will be, when you give me my walking papers.",
        "Lillian: Patience, dear Buzz. And really, here I am, this attractive blonde, fluffing your pillows for you. You going to have someone at home doing that?",
        "Buzz: Are you teasing me?",
        "Lillian: Yes.",
        "Buzz: I'm a cardiac patient.",
        "Lillian: (Laughs) I'm a woman.",
        "Buzz: It doesn't matter anyway. My next stop's probably going to be the gray bar hotel.",
        "Lillian: You didn't do it, did you?",
        "Buzz: Shoot Phillip? No.",
        "Lillian: Then you have nothing to worry about. And I really want you to stop worrying because all that stress is not good for your heart.",
        "Harris: Hey, Billy. Long time no see.",
        "Billy: I've been waiting here half an hour. Where have you been?",
        "Harris: I'm bad with time.",
        "Billy: Yeah, well, you know, hey, I told you scare the guy, not kill him.",
        "Harris: You're drawing attention to yourself.",
        "Billy: You're drawing attention to me. I'm not going down for this.",
        "Harris: Just pay me what you owe me and I'll get the heck out of dodge.",
        "Billy: Okay. Here you go. Never to be seen again.",
        "Lillian: Billy? Oh, you're here to see Buzz. Come on.",
        "Billy: Well, I... okay. Why not?",
        "Lillian: Look who is here?",
        "Buzz: Lewis, get in here. I'm not contagious.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Anderson: Mr. Aitoro?",
        "Gus: Yes.",
        "Anderson: I'm Brian Anderson.",
        "Gus: I know who you are, yes. How are you? Thank you very much for coming down to see me. You want to sit down? Can I get you a beer or something, if you...",
        "Anderson: No, thanks.",
        "Gus: No?",
        "Anderson: I was a little surprised to hear from you.",
        "Gus: Yes, well, I had heard what you did for my Aunt, and I was very grateful and... Because I know you were reprimanded.",
        "Anderson: They suspended me from the prison.",
        "Gus: Yeah, well, I'm sorry about that. And that's why I thought maybe, you know, you'd be interested in a position in security with Spaulding.",
        "Anderson: I really appreciate you thinking of me.",
        "Gus: Yeah? Well, you've proved your loyalty to this family and that says it all.",
        "Anderson: I brought my resume, if you'd like to see it.",
        "Gus: I'd love to, thank you. Yes. Seven years as a corrections guard. That's a long time being one of those officers. There's a lot of desperate people in those prisons, hmm?",
        "Anderson: None more so than your Aunt. Like it was a matter of life and death.",
        "Gus: That's the truth. My brother was killed.",
        "Anderson: I know. I'm sorry.",
        "Gus: Do you have any idea where my Aunt was that night at...",
        "Alexandra: This is very cozy, isn't it? What do you think you're doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ruth: You're arresting me for murder? This is preposterous!",
        "Fantini: I heard what you said just now to that guy. That Phillip Spaulding got what he deserved?",
        "Ruth: That just was opinion, dear. You can't arrest someone for an opinion. This is the U.S. of A.",
        "Fantini: Yeah, true, but you practically took credit for doing the guy in.",
        "Ruth: Okay, well, that was the cocktail speaking, young man, okay? Listen, I am a passionate woman but you can't possibly believe I'm a murderer!",
        "Fantini: All I know is that you look like one of our chief suspects. In fact, you're a dead ringer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Isn't your Mommy funny? She pretends that I'm the big, bad wolf.",
        "Olivia: Who's pretending?",
        "Bill: Alan, I'm just about to take my family to the mall, so if you wouldn't mind, we...",
        "Alan: Your family to the mall? My, my, you do set up house very quickly, don't you?",
        "Bill: Well, not really.",
        "Alan: Well, of course, Emma, your Mommy has a knack for that, too.",
        "Bill: All right.",
        "Olivia: I am so ready.",
        "Alan: Don't forget what the big, bad wolf does.",
        "Bill: Well, our house is made of brick so you can blow all you want.",
        "Alan: (Clears throat) Bill, are you sure that you want to get in the middle of this fight?",
        "Olivia: You know what, sweetheart? We're going to go see another man with a beard who's actually very kind and very generous. Okay?",
        "Alan: Anyone I know?",
        "Olivia: Let me give you a hint: He used to leave coal in your stocking.",
        "Alan: (Laughs) Bill? Actually, I wanted to have a word with you.",
        "Bill: And you did, and I promise we'll do it again soon.",
        "Alan: Privately. It's in your family's best interest.",
        "Olivia: Forget it. No. You want to threaten somebody, you threaten me.",
        "Alan: Threaten someone? Olivia, how your mind works. Some business matters are better left to the men folk.",
        "Olivia: I don't think so.",
        "Bill: Here, here, here. Go. Go ahead. I'll meet up with you two.",
        "Olivia: No.",
        "Bill: Don't worry. I'm just... I'm a little curious, that's all.",
        "Olivia: Whatever he has to say, it isn't worth listening to.",
        "Bill: I know. I know. But listen, I'll meet you there, okay? All right?",
        "Olivia: Okay.",
        "Bill: Have fun.",
        "Alan: She is a wonderful little girl, isn't she? I can't blame you for wanting to adopt her.",
        "Bill: How did you know that?",
        "Alan: Well, come on. Wake up. This is my town, Bill. I know everything.",
        "Bill: (Laughs) So, let me guess. What's this all about? You going to try and stop me?",
        "Alan: On the contrary, I'm going to try to save you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: I just came by to see how you were. Maybe you need your rest. I'll tell you what; I'll come back a little later.",
        "Buzz: I doubt I'll be here. I'm going to be sprung today.",
        "Billy: Oh, really?",
        "Lillian: Yeah. You stay, Billy, because he needs a little distraction.",
        "Billy: Oh. So, you feel a little better?",
        "Buzz: I feel great.",
        "Lillian: (Clears throat)",
        "Buzz: There's absolutely nothing wrong with me.",
        "Billy: Something tells me that you better take it easy with that ticker of yours, buddy.",
        "Buzz: I wonder what that \"something\" might be.",
        "Lillian: You be careful. I am in charge here.",
        "Buzz: Oh, nurses, nurses, nurses.",
        "Lillian: Yes, yes.",
        "Buzz: Run this place with such beauty and grace. It's just something to behold. You should see it, Billy.",
        "Billy: You're very smooth, buddy.",
        "Lillian: You certainly are. But I sure wish you'd take yourself more seriously. Do you know how much I hate seeing you on this side of the street?",
        "Buzz: I don't think you're going to get a chance to see me on the other side. Come see me on visiting days in Vailsburg.",
        "Billy: Oh, come on. Don't talk like that.",
        "Lillian: Well, Jeffrey O'Neill was in here, and with such a hefty dose of pessimism. But he's not guilty.",
        "Billy: No. I know he's not. Hey, something's going to work out.",
        "Buzz: You know there's nothing like a murder charge hanging over one's head to bring down a room. Don't be so glum, William.",
        "Lillian: Now, you're not trusting your son. Frank is going to find the real murderer.",
        "Buzz: We'll see.",
        "Lillian: You know it's bad enough that somebody killed Phillip, but to send an innocent man to prison? What kind of person would do something like that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Look, I'm just trying to hold a job interview here. Do you mind?",
        "Alexandra: Yes, I do mind. What is he asking you?",
        "Gus: That is my business, Alexandra.",
        "Alexandra: No. See, I'm afraid that my nephew has dragged you down here under false pretenses.",
        "Gus: No, I haven't. There is an opening in security.",
        "Alexandra: Well, of course there is, yes. He wants you to tell him all the information about the night I left my jail cell.",
        "Gus: Do you have a problem with that?",
        "Alexandra: Yes. See, this is merely a ploy--there's no job--for you to just tell all.",
        "Gus: That doesn't... look, there is a job. Don't try to confuse the guy. There's a job opening.",
        "Alexandra: Ha.",
        "Gus: I give you my word there's a job opening.",
        "Anderson: Look, I don't want to get involved in this, whatever it is.",
        "Gus: I'm sorry, pal. You're already involved. You were involved the minute you helped her sneak out of prison.",
        "Alexandra: No, no, no. You see, my nephew is merely... there's no job. This is a witch-hunt, pure and simple.",
        "Gus: Yeah, well, that's about right. A witch-hunt. I'd call it that.",
        "Anderson: I think I've said enough.",
        "Alexandra: I agree.",
        "Gus: Hold on, Mr. Anderson, please. Just hold on a second, okay?",
        "Anderson: I'm sorry.",
        "Gus: Yo.",
        "Alexandra: No, you hold it.",
        "Gus: You're going back to prison, Alexandra, okay? It's just a matter of time.",
        "Alexandra: I did not kill Phillip. I loved him like a son.",
        "Gus: Uh-huh. That's why you were so upset with him?",
        "Alexandra: He was trying to banish me. Who wouldn't be upset?",
        "Gus: But you weren't going to be banished, now, were you?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, come on. That doesn't mean that I would...",
        "Gus: That what? That you were desperate? I think you were desperate. Even the ex-guard, he said to me that you were desperate. He said it.",
        "Alexandra: You think you have this whole thing figured out, don't you?",
        "Gus: You know what? Yeah. I do think I have it figured out. I hear myself talking about it. You pay this guy off, you get out of your prison cell, you come over to Company, you pay Phillip a little visit, you go back to your little room, all before the body's cold.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, yeah? You are so far off base.",
        "Gus: No, actually, I don't think I am, because it's the perfect alibi. You cannot be in two places at ...",
        "Alexandra: Oh, yes. My perfect alibi, and why did I destroy my own perfect alibi by coming to Buzz's side? If I were the killer, why would I do that?",
        "Gus: I know. I'm still working that piece out, trying to figure that out.",
        "Alexandra: Really? Well, you know what? I think I know why. I think I know why. You're trying to clear Buzz's name, for Harley. But I'm telling you, if you keep going down this road, the whole thing is going to blow up in your face.",
        "Gus: Just trying to find out the truth, and you're not going to stop me.",
        "Alexandra: Well, fine, fine. Come on. Come on after me. I am just warning you, my dear that you're going to be the one to put the last nail in Buzz's coffin.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Fantini: Yeah, that's right, chief. Yeah, I got her right here. I'm bringing her in. All right, come on.",
        "Ruth: Oh, dear.",
        "Fantini: You're not fooling anybody, lady. Come on.",
        "Ruth: I don't feel so good.",
        "Fantini: Would you get up?",
        "Ruth: I can't.",
        "Fantini: Well, you have to. Come on.",
        "Ruth: I'm not much of a boozer, sir.",
        "Fantini: Well, you could have fooled me.",
        "Ruth: No, you don't understand. I don't drink very often. I think I need to use the ladies' room before we go.",
        "Fantini: No. You can use the facilities downtown.",
        "Ruth: You're not listening. I think I'm going to barf in your car.",
        "Fantini: Ugh. Okay, okay, okay.",
        "Ruth: Let me out of these, please? Quickly? (Groaning)",
        "Fantini: I'm going to be right outside this door.",
        "Ruth: Uh-huh. Great. Now what, genius?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Let me put aside my feelings for Olivia for a moment, and just tell you that I've been watching you.",
        "Bill: (Laughs) well, that's a little creepy.",
        "Alan: Well, it's important to know your competition.",
        "Bill: Well, I'm flattered you see us as your competition.",
        "Alan: Phillip did.",
        "Bill: Apparently so.",
        "Alan: Yeah. The little company that could.",
        "Bill: (Laughs)",
        "Alan: You started as a speck of dust and in just a few months, you've become a major contender.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, I appreciate that, Alan. I really do. I couldn't have done it without Olivia.",
        "Alan: Well, I'm sure Olivia contributed in her own way.",
        "Bill: Oh, you underestimate her.",
        "Alan: No, I underestimated her once, never again. But Olivia in business in one thing, and Olivia as a woman is an entirely different matter.",
        "Bill: Will you please get to the point?",
        "Alan: If you're serious about adopting my granddaughter, think through the consequences.",
        "Bill: Meaning what?",
        "Alan: What happens to you and Emma when Olivia self-destructs?",
        "Bill: It's not going to happen.",
        "Alan: Don't be naive. Olivia has left a trail of bodies behind, and if you don't believe me, just go have a discussion with your Uncle Josh.",
        "Bill: This isn't about saving me. This is about you wanting Emma all to yourself.",
        "Alan: True.",
        "Bill: Hmm.",
        "Alan: But what do you want? You're a young man. Are you sure you want to tie yourself to Emma and Olivia? I mean, is it worth the risk?",
        "Bill: There is no risk, Alan.",
        "Alan: Well, good luck then, because you're going to need it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: You know the worst thing about being an invalid/accused murderer is the way people look at you or don't look at you. Would you lighten up, Lewis? You're beginning to depress me.",
        "Billy: You know, whoever killed Phillip, I bet you he had a really good reason.",
        "Lillian: I hope I just didn't hear that.",
        "Billy: No, I'm sorry, Lillian, but you know, the guy was using his power to really hurt people. I mean he took his kids away from their mothers? The man was definitely making enemies.",
        "Lillian: That doesn't justify murdering him.",
        "Billy: People react very strangely to evil.",
        "Lillian: Phillip was not evil.",
        "Billy: Well, I think he was well on his way there. What do you say, Buzz?",
        "Buzz: I don't know. I just don't want to go down for it.",
        "Billy: Could I just have a minute with him, Lillian, please?",
        "Lillian: Oh, so all Phillip-sympathizers have to leave the room, is that it?",
        "Buzz: Why don't you go check with the doctor, see if he signed my release papers?",
        "Lillian: Okay, but I'm coming back.",
        "Buzz: Okay, it's just you and me.",
        "Billy: You know I know what it's like to want somebody dead. I mean you get pushed just so far and...",
        "Buzz: And what? What?",
        "Billy: Well, I mean, supposing this guy didn't want to kill Phillip but just wanted to scare him? I mean, put the fear of God into him, and maybe things got out of hand?",
        "Buzz: Billy, do you know something that can clear me?",
        "Billy: I wish I did.",
        "Buzz: Thanks for getting my hopes up.",
        "Billy: I'm sorry, Buzz. I... I just understand. I'm sure something else will come up.",
        "Buzz: Well, I'm open for suggestions.",
        "Billy: Hey, look, your daughter's working on this and so is Gus and they're going to turn up something.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, sure, maybe.",
        "Billy: Well, if they don't, I'll get everybody in Springfield to testify how they wanted to kill Phillip.",
        "Buzz: The evidence still points to me.",
        "Billy: Buzz, you're not going to go down for this, I promise.",
        "Buzz: Well, with people like you on my side, I can almost believe that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: You know, Alexandra, all you ever did was lie to me, so why should I believe you now?",
        "Alexandra: I don't know.",
        "Gus: You don't know? You don't know. Is that your final answer, you don't know?",
        "Alexandra: I already told you I left my jail cell that night, and I saw Buzz.",
        "Gus: Mm-hmm. Where exactly did you see Buzz?",
        "Alexandra: Here, at Company.",
        "Gus: Was that before or after Phillip was shot?",
        "Alexandra: I don't know.",
        "Gus: Did you see Phillip?",
        "Alexandra: I never went inside.",
        "Gus: Why not?",
        "Alexandra: Because Buzz came out. He was very upset. We sat on the park bench. We commiserated.",
        "Gus: Are you telling me you only saw Buzz outside?",
        "Alexandra: I told you that.",
        "Gus: No, you didn't tell me that.",
        "Alexandra: Outside, then. Outside.",
        "Gus: So, how do you even know that Phillip was alive?",
        "Alexandra: Buzz told me.",
        "Gus: Do you believe him?",
        "Alexandra: Well, why wouldn't I? He did not kill Phillip. I did not kill Phillip.",
        "Gus: So, basically we're back to the same, old story? Right? Except now you've added the fact that you were outside with Buzz, and only outside. Is there anything else you'd like to tell me that you haven't told me?",
        "Alexandra: I've told you just enough to keep Buzz out of prison.",
        "Gus: Well, I believe you.",
        "Alexandra: You do?",
        "Gus: Yeah, that you're trying to keep somebody out of prison.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Pounding on door) Fantini: You've had plenty of time to upchuck! Come on! I mean it! Out! (Crashing)",
        "Harley: Oh, my God! This crazy lady just went flying out that window.",
        "Fantini: What? Oh, great. Just great! Which way did she go?",
        "Harley: I don't know. I don't know. I was washing my hands and she shoved me out of the way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Anderson: No, honey. It didn't work out. I love you, too.",
        "Gus: Mr. Anderson, can I ask you a question? Why are you helping my Aunt? Is it for the money? Because if it is, I can offer you more.",
        "Anderson: I'm not protecting her.",
        "Gus: It certainly seems like you are.",
        "Anderson: I can't help you.",
        "Gus: No, actually, Anderson, you are going to help me. You are.",
        "Anderson: Forget it.",
        "Gus: Anderson, are you familiar with accessory to murder? Being a prison guard, ex-prison guard and everything? Well, let me explain it to you. You'd be going back to prison, but this time in a new capacity, and it would involve a little orange jumpsuit in about your size.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Is this seat taken?",
        "Alexandra: You... (laughs) ...must be joking. Have you got a camera hidden in your lapel, or...?",
        "Billy: No, no. No camera.",
        "Alexandra: You want to sit here?",
        "Billy: Yeah, I really could use the company.",
        "Alexandra: Please, sit. Be my guest. Coffee?",
        "Billy: Yes, please. I just came from seeing Buzz.",
        "Alexandra: How is he?",
        "Billy: He's worried.",
        "Alexandra: Why don't the police just leave him alone? He didn't kill Phillip.",
        "Billy: But you see they kind of have to go with what they got.",
        "Alexandra: There has to be something that can clear him.",
        "Billy: Short of the murderer coming in and confessing, I don't know what. You know?",
        "Alexandra: Neither do I.",
        "Billy: Look, you and I both know what it's like. I mean most people have no idea.",
        "Alexandra: What what's like?",
        "Billy: Prison.",
        "Alexandra: Ah, yes.",

        "Alexandra: Well, although they do say--the big \"they\"--what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.",
        "Billy: Yeah, well those people have never been there, because it kills a part of you, and I don't think it ever comes back. Which is why...",
        "Alexandra: Why what?",
        "Billy: I will do anything not to go back.",
        "Alexandra: Anything?",

        "Billy: Anything.",
        "Gus: Do I have your attention now, Mr. Anderson?",
        "Anderson: You can't pin that on me. Your Aunt didn't kill your brother.",
        "Gus: How do you know that?",
        "Anderson: Because she was never out of my sight. I drove her into town that night.",
        "Gus: Where exactly did you drive her?",
        "Anderson: Here. But she never went inside.",
        "Gus: Did you tell this to the police?",
        "Anderson: No. I couldn't say anything.",
        "Gus: Why is that?",
        "Anderson: Because of the reason she didn't go inside. There was a gunshot--at least now I think that's what it was. At the time, I thought it was a truck backfiring.",
        "Gus: A truck. You're kidding me, right?",
        "Anderson: That's what happened. And then this guy ran by.",
        "Gus: Wait? A guy? What did he look like?",
        "Anderson: I'm not sure. I was sitting in my car. It was dark.",
        "Gus: Is this him?",
        "Anderson: I think so.",

        "Gus: Wait a second. Harley...",
        "Harley: I'm not you. If I find out that my father is the killer, I will not lie to save him. Hey, you.",

        "Buzz: I feel like getting out. Hey? Is it windy outside?",

        "Harley: Forget about that, okay? Actually, I came here with good news.",
        "Buzz: Oh, I could use a little of that.",
        "Harley: (Laughs) I saw Ruth Karloff.",
        "Buzz: Welcome to the club.",
        "Harley: Yeah, but so did an undercover cop.",
        "Buzz: Did they nab her?",
        "Harley: Well, no but apparently she was shooting off her mouth about Phillip's murder. She pretty much took the credit for it.",
        "Buzz: Pretty much?",
        "Harley: Daddy, this is good news. Don't you see? If Jeffrey O'Neill and Frank believe that Ruth Karloff is the killer, they won't arrest you.",
        "Buzz: I think we've got to face facts. Just because this Karloff woman was shooting off her mouth doesn't mean that I'm going to be off the hook for...",
        "Harley: Daddy, just can't you be happy about this?",
        "Buzz: Harley. Harley. We both know I'm probably going to be arrested.",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Buzz: And I'm probably going to be indicted.",
        "Harley: Over my dead body.",
        "Buzz: Or over mine.",
        "Harley: Don't say that.",
        "Buzz: So we should be prepared.",
        "Harley: I'm not going to let it happen. What are you doing?",
        "Buzz: I'm writing my will. I always meant to get around to it, but you know how it is.",
        "Harley: Well, I think... a will is fine unless it means you think you're dying.",
        "Buzz: I want you to look at it and see if I left anything out.",
        "Harley: I'll tell you what? Why don't I look at this later?",
        "Buzz: I want you to look at it. Look at it now, please. It wasn't, you know, lawyer-written. It was personal. Okay?",
        "Harley: \"My name is Buzz Cooper and it's time to say good-bye.\"",

        "Clerk: She said it was important.",
        "Olivia: Okay, thanks. Would you just keep an eye on her for a second? Hi. It's Olivia Spencer. I'm calling for nurse McGuire.",
        "Nurse: Mrs. Spaulding. Thank you for getting back to me so quickly.",
        "Olivia: Actually, it's Mrs. Lewis now.",
        "Nurse: Oh, I'm sorry. But you were married to Phillip Spaulding?",
        "Olivia: I was. What's this about?",
        "Nurse: Mrs. Lewis, we were renovating your ex-husband's room and came across documents that refer to some stock transactions, apparently made by you. They were hidden in the wall.",
        "Olivia: Oh, my. I've been looking for those.",
        "Nurse: Well, you can pick them up anytime.",
        "Olivia: I'll be right over. Thanks for calling. Lee, would you do me a favor? Would you take Emma up to daycare? I have to run out for a few minutes, okay?",

The last of the lottery money I blew in Vegas trying to double it at the blackjack tables. My shot glass collection got broken in the move to Harley's, when Frank drove over the box with the moving truck. I guess there's my bike, but the clutch is shot and it needs new tires. So, what do I have to give to my... ...kids?\" Daddy.",
        "Buzz: \"What do I have to give to my kids and grandkids? I'll always love you guys you know that. My genes you can't do anything about. The only other thing is my promise that I will never leave you. You won't see my face or hear my voice, but I'll still be there. When someone plays Greek music and you feel like dancing, I'll be there. When Frank walks Marina down the aisle at her wedding, I'll be there. When you drive down Fifth Street, even though those trendy shops and French restaurants keep popping up, I'll be there.\" A lot of this is borrowed from Steinbeck, but you know, it's true. \"When somebody knocks you down, I'll see it and help you up. When you screw up big-time, and you're related to me so it's bound to happen, I'll understand and I'll get you through it. When your time is up, I'll be waiting. Me and Deanie, right at the pearly gates. But don't rush it. First, if you want to, take back Company. Find a sweet girl for Coop, a nice guy for Marina, and above all else, a good woman for Frank.

It's the same reason there are bars on the window. To keep people like you, Phillip... to keep people from you, Phillip, from getting out of here and hurting anyone. Oh, God. Why couldn't they have just kept you here? You'd still be alive. Highly sedated but... all right. Well, I just hope it skips generations, for Emma's sake. (Sighs) There is a reason why you hid those papers in a wall, Phillip, and that means I am finally free of you. Come on. Where's the nurse? Alan?",
        "Alan: Hello, Olivia. It's nice to see that you've made yourself at home. Why don't you just lay down there and get real comfortable? Because, you see, you're going to be here a long time.",
