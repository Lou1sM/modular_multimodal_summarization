        "Lizzie: How do I look? ",
        "Coop: Oh, you... incredible. You look \r\namazing. ",
        "Lizzie: Come here. ( Laughter ) do you like \r\nthe wrapping? ",
        "Coop: ( Stammering ) I... yeah... ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, that's a good answer. ( \r\nLaughter ) wait, wait. Just um... ",
        "Coop: Uh... Lizzie. ",
        "Lizzie: Okay. Sorry. ",
        "Coop: No. Uh... yeah. ",
        "Lizzie: I know, I saw this in a magazine and \r\nI had to try it. Listen to the voice inside say I love you... Okay. Wait, wait \r\nlisten to my heart it's calling for you ooh, you know I just can't hide it I \r\nlove you... Okay. Now, um, you come to this side of the bed. Now tell me what's \r\nin here. ",
        "Coop: Okay. Um... ",
        "Lizzie: Come on, Coop, don't hold back.\r\n",
        "Coop: I won't. Lizzie, you are so beautiful. \r\nI mean this room is just... it's incredible. I got to know, how did you afford \r\nit? ",
        "\r\n________________________________________",
        "\r\nDinah: ( Whistling ) you come here often? Nah. Guess just in the winter, kid.\r\n",
        "Mallet: A waste of time talking to Frosty, \r\nhe's real stiff, and cold? You betcha. ",
        "Dinah: You telling me this isn't the guy you \r\nwere going to bring tonight to lighten things up? ",
        "Mallet: Oh. No, sorry, I guess until my \r\nfriend gets here, you'll be stuck with me and Frosty. ",
        "Dinah: So we're the only three people in town \r\nthat don't have any family around at Christmas time, huh? ",
        "Reva: Hi. Dinah. Hi. ",
        "Mallet: Hi. ",
        "Reva: A.C. Mallet. ",
        "Mallet: Happy holidays. ",
        "Reva: Yeah, you, too. ",
        "Dinah: Hi. So, do you guys want to join us \r\nfor the Christmas without kids society? What's the matter? ",
        "Billy: Well, actually, we were going over to \r\nCassie's house. ",
        "Reva: Yeah, a tree-trimming party. \n",
        "\r\n________________________________________",
        "\r\nOlivia: I'm looking forward to this. ",
        "Josh: Well, I have to say, I believe it is \r\nvery generous of you to have bought an ornament for Cassie\u2019s tree, although it \r\nis going to make me look bad considering I left the baklava on top of the car.\r\n",
        "Olivia: Oh, that can happen to you, but no, \r\nyou're not going to show up empty-handed because I put both our names on the \r\ncard for the ornament, if that's okay? ",
        "Josh: Lovely, thank you very much. \n",
        "Olivia: Yeah. ",
        "\r\n________________________________________",
        "\r\nTammy: Mom, there's something I need to talk to you about. It's about the fire \r\nat the cottage. ",
        "Cassie: What about the fire? ",
        "Tammy: I need to tell you the truth. Do you \r\nknow how that fire started. ",
        "Cassie: Jonathan started it. ",
        "Tammy: No. ",
        "Cassie: Tammy. ",
        "Tammy: He didn't. ",
        "Cassie: He was seen at the house, and we all \r\nknow it is not the first fire he has set. ",
        "Tammy: So. So he's made some mistakes, like \r\neveryone else. Mom, he's changed. ",
        "Cassie: I wish I could believe that. ( \r\nKnocking at the door ) ",
        "Sandy: Happy holidays. ",
        "\u00a0Tammy: You invited him without asking me?\r\n",
        "Sandy: Don't blame your mom. I came on my own \r\naccord. I heard about the party, and I brought something for the tree. \n",
        "Tammy: Thank you. Did you come for any other \r\nreason? ",
        "Sandy: If you had a minute to talk, I \r\nwouldn't mind. ",
        "Cassie: He is here already. ",
        "Tammy: Well it's freezing out, so you can \r\ncome in for a little while. ",
        "Sandy: Thank you. ",
        "\r\n________________________________________",
        "\r\nDinah: Cassie's tree-trimming party; warn the neighbors. ",
        "Reva: Fun, huh? ",
        "Dinah: If you say so. ",
        "Reva: You know, Dinah, I'm sure Cassie \r\nwouldn't mind if you came along with us, stop by. You two have been through an \r\nawful lot this year. ",
        "Dinah: Yeah, an awful lot we would both like \r\nto forget. ",
        "Billy: Hey, a lot of people had a rough time \r\nin '05. I think we should get going. ",
        "Reva: Yeah, but, please, come along, there \r\nwill be plenty of popcorn and cranberries for stringing garlands.\u00a0 (Laughs ) see \r\nya. ",
        "Mallet: Bye. Have fun. ",
        "Dinah: Blah, blah, blah-blah! I'd like to \r\nknow what's wrong with me. Could someone check me out, because holidays make me \r\nsick. I don't enjoy them. I'd like to drown myself in a bowl of chilli, a pint \r\nof beer and puke. ",
        "Mallet: That's a good idea, let's go do that.\r\n",
        "Dinah: Oh. Listen to me. ",
        "Mallet: Hmm? ",
        "Dinah: So much as a whisper of\r\nMerry Christmas to me, I ask \r\nyou-- I beg of you to please arrest them for some sort of like disturbing the \r\npeace or something. ",
        "Mallet: Okay. That's a deal, you got it.\r\n",
        "Dinah: Oh, God bless you. ",
        "O come all ye faithful joyful \r\nand triumphant ",
        "o come ye, o come ye to \r\nBethlehem.",
        "\r\n________________________________________",
        "\nOlivia: I can't get over how beautiful \r\nthis time of year is. ",
        "Josh: Now if I recall correctly, you did not \r\nlike the snow a whole lot that time we got stuck in the blizzard. ",
        "Olivia: Oh, no, no. But do you remember what \r\nwe did when we got home? ",
        "Josh: Yeah. I think we should probably get to \r\nCassie\u2019s before all of the eggnog is gone. ",
        "Olivia: Thanks for taking me with you. And if \r\nthis is in any way awkward with Reva, then I don't need to... ",
        "Josh: I'm not worried about Reva. ",
        "Olivia: Jeffrey and Cassie? ",
        "Josh: I gave Cassie an envelope with the \r\npicture in it; she threw it in the fireplace and burned it. That's enough for \r\nme. I'm just going to try to enjoy myself, enjoy the season and the company.\r\n",
        "\r\n________________________________________",
        "\r\nLizzie: Who cares how we got it. We got it and it's ours until-- take this thing \r\noff-- until tomorrow at least. ",
        "Coop: Okay. Lizzie... ",
        "Lizzie: You need to quit wasting time. \n",
        "Coop: Lizzie, listen to me, okay? Please.\r\n",
        "Lizzie: Okay. Time for talking is over. They \r\nsay once you're in the bed then... ",
        "Coop: I'm concerned, okay? That's all. I mean \r\nhow did we even get here? ",
        "Lizzie: I stole it. ",
        "Coop: You-- what? From who? ",
        "Lizzie: I stole it. Alan Spaulding, my \r\ngrandfather. I stole the key out of his safe. He doesn't seem to be complaining, \r\nso you shouldn't either. Just tell me thank you, Lizzie, for this amazing gift.\r\n",
        "Coop: Uh-huh, you came prepared. Well, thank \r\nyou, Lizzie, for this truly amazing gift. Thank you so much. ",
        "Lizzie: That's good, that's really good. Now \r\nall you have to... ",
        "Coop: I know. I know. Come here. ",
        "Oh won't you give me another \r\nchance ",
        "I want to spend my life with \r\nyou... ",
        "Coop: Hey, hey, hey. Okay, hold on. \n",
        "Lizzie: Don't stop me. ",
        "Coop: No. Lizzie, I know that probably every \r\nmagazine in the world says that this is it, and that you and I should make love, \r\nbut... if you're not ready and you don't want to do this, just say so, okay?\r\n",
        "\r\n________________________________________",
        "\r\nBilly: Darling, are you okay with this? ",
        "Reva: I'm fine. I love holiday parties.\r\n",
        "Billy: Yeah, but I mean Josh is going to be \r\nhere. ",
        "Reva: And that's okay, too. Just as long as \r\nOlivia is not in the mix. ",
        "Billy: All right. Then something else is on \r\nyour mind. ",
        "Reva: It's Jonathan. I just hope that \r\nwherever he is, he's happy. ",
        "\r\n________________________________________",
        "\r\nCassie: I just want her to be happy. ",
        "Jeffrey: Even if it's with Sandy, the guy \r\nwho's caused her so much pain? ",
        "Cassie: It's her decision. I just worry, you \r\nknow, with the fire and Jonathan. The whole thing makes me nervous. ",
        "Jeffrey: Do you think Jonathan could have \r\nstarted that fire? ",
        "Cassie: Absolutely. I'm glad he's not coming \r\ntonight. ",
        "Reva: Merry Christmas. ",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, hey! ",
        "Cassie: Hi! I'm so glad you could make it.\r\n",
        "Reva: Well, I wouldn't miss it. ",
        "Cassie: He just showed up. We're staying out \r\nof it. ",
        "Josh: Merry Christmas. ",
        "Olivia: Hi. Merry Christmas. ",
        "Reva: Well, ho-ho, ho. ",
        "\r\n________________________________________",
        "\r\nSandy: Here. ",
        "Tammy: My mom's handling all of the tree \r\nstuff. ",
        "Sandy: No, you open it. Please. ",
        "Tammy: It is very, um... Sandy. ",
        "Sandy: And there's more, see? New divorce \r\npapers. ",
        "Tammy: I told you, I'm not going to... \n",
        "Sandy: The lawyer messed up, Tammy. Jeffrey's \r\nhelping me out now, and as soon as these are filed, I'll be a free man. And \r\nthere will be nothing to stop you from letting me put that ring back on your \r\nfinger. ",
        "\r\n________________________________________",
        "\r\nLizzie: What, do I seem nervous, because I'm not at all. I'm really ready?\r\n",
        "Coop: No, Lizzie, Lizzie, listen. We've \r\ntalked about this, okay? This is not something to rush right through, okay? This \r\nis definitely not a race. ",
        "Lizzie: I thought I knew exactly how tonight \r\nwas going to go. ",
        "Coop: Okay, how could you be ready or even \r\nknow? I mean this is your first time. ",
        "Lizzie: The magazines. ",
        "Coop: The magazines, right. ",
        "Lizzie: Well, they're supposed to spell it \r\nout for you step by step. ",
        "Coop: Hey, what's the matter? ",
        "Lizzie: I just wanted tonight... ",
        "Coop: To be perfect? Yeah, I got that. But \r\nguess what? I've got great news. ",
        "Lizzie: What? ",
        "Coop: There's absolutely no way that you \r\ncould make a mistake. ",
        "Lizzie: How do you know that? ",
        "Coop: Well, because I'll show you. Right now.\r\n",
        "Lizzie: Coop. ",
        "Coop: Mm-hmm? ",
        "Lizzie: I'm glad I waited, you know if it \r\nmeans I get to be with you when I... ",
        "Coop: I know. I know. And trust me. Come \r\nhere, come here. Please just trust me? You will know exactly what to do. \n",
        "Lizzie: It's going to happen, isn't it?\r\n",
        "Coop: Yeah. And it's already perfect. \n",

        "Dinah: Arrest him like you said you were \r\ngoing to do. ",
        "Mallet: He's kind of festive. ",
        "Dinah: You know what? All talk and no action, \r\nMallet. ",
        "Christ, the lord. O sing choirs \r\nof angels sing in exultation ",
        "sing all that here and...\r\n",
        "Mallet: Okay, thank you very much! You might \r\nwant to stop the show now. Jeff, close your mouth, please. ",

        "Mallet: You know what? You're under arrest.\r\n",
        "Caroler: On what charge? ",
        "Mallet: Bad... bad singing without a permit.\r\n",
        "Caroler: Oh, hell, lord, we greet thee joyful \r\nand triumphant. ",
        "Mallet: Okay. Thank you very much. Lovely. \r\nHere's some money for the shelter. ",
        "Caroler: Thank you. ",
        "Mallet: Thanks for being such a good sport; I \r\nappreciate it. ",
        "Caroler: Thank you. Merry Christmas! \n",

        "\r\n________________________________________",
        "\r\nOlivia: Well, isn't this a nice gathering. ",
        "Reva: It was. ",
        "Josh: Hello, Reva? ",
        "Reva: Joshua. What an interesting crowd.\r\n",
        "Cassie: There's room for everyone. \n",
        "Josh: Sandy, too, huh? ",
        "Reva: No Jonathan? ",
        "Cassie: Actually, he wasn't invited. \n",
        "Reva: Cassie, I know... ",
        "Cassie: Reva, I'm sorry, can we not go into \r\nthis tonight? I really think we all have enough on our minds without having to \r\nworry about Jonathan. ",
        "Billy: Hey! I thought we were here to trim \r\nthe tree, so when do we get to help out R.J.? ",
        "Cassie: Right now. ",
        "Billy: Good. ",
        "Olivia: Cassie, Joshua and I brought you an \r\nornament. ",
        "Cassie: Thank you. ",
        "Olivia: You're welcome. ",
        "Cassie: Oh, it's beautiful. ",
        "Reva: You should probably make room for two, \r\nthen. This is from me and Billy. ( Laughter ) ",
        "Tammy: I know that you were hurt by this, \r\ntoo, and I don't want to make it worse. But I don't want to give you any false \r\nhope, either. ",
        "Sandy: Tammy, we... ",
        "Tammy: Let me finish. It doesn't matter now \r\nif you divorce Ava or not. You and I are over. ",
        "Sandy: We can't be. I swear to you, we can \r\nfix this. ",
        "Tammy: Face it, Sandy, there was always \r\nsomething missing. ",
        "Sandy: And you really think you have it all \r\nwith Jonathan? ",
        "Tammy: I think you should go. ",
        "Sandy: Take a look around. Do you think \r\nJonathan will ever fit in with your family on nights like these? He'll never \r\nfit, period. I mean he is your cousin. ",
        "Tammy: I don't want to talk about it anymore.\r\n",
        "Sandy: Wait. ",
        "Jeffrey: Let her go. ",
        "Tammy: Sandy, no! ",
        "Jonathan: Sandy? ",
        "Tammy: Oh, my God. Oh, I'm so glad you're \r\nhere. ",
        "Jonathan: What's going on, you're shaking?\r\n",
        "Tammy: It's like a bad dream in there. Sandy \r\nshowed up and tried to give me the\r\nwedding ring back and tell me \r\nthat we could get back together, and... ",
        "R.J.: Sandy, can you hang the angel up high \r\nfor me? ",
        "\r\n________________________________________",
        "\nComing up on \"Guiding \r\nLight\"... ",
        "Mallet: I'm glad you and your \r\nmom found each other. ",
        "Dinah: Yeah, thanks to you, you \r\nbig lug. ",
        "Lizzie: I do, I love you. Okay, \r\nmaybe we can do this on a regular basis. ",
        "Sandy: Where are the sleds?\r\n",
        "Jeffrey: In the barn. There's a \r\nwhole bunch of them. ",
        "Sandy: Cool. Let's go get them.\r\n",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. ",
        "Dinah: I can't believe you're here. \n",
        "Vanessa: Oh, well, it's really me. I'm really \r\nhere and I'm really glad to see you. ",
        "Dinah: What are you doing here? I didn't know \r\nyou were coming to town. ",
        "Vanessa: Ooh. ",
        "Dinah: What? What? ",
        "Vanessa: Well it's just that I'm so glad to \r\nhave such a nice welcome from you, that's all. ",
        "Dinah: Well I hardly get to see you anymore. \r\nAnd, usually, there's a problem and that problem's usually me. ",
        "Vanessa: Well not this time. This time I just \r\nuh... I had an urge to come to Springfield for Christmas. So I miss my girl.\r\n",
        "Dinah: Oh, my gosh. I mean you should've just \r\nseen me about a half hour ago. ",
        "Vanessa: Why? ",
        "Dinah: Well, I don't know, I was... I was \r\ngoing on and on about how I wasn't... I wasn't going to have any family around \r\nthis year. And, I don't know, I knew I was going to be alone-- not counting one \r\npesky little cop friend I know. ",
        "Vanessa: Well, let me see. Would that be by \r\nany chance uh... detective Mallet? ",
        "Dinah: Yes. How did you know that? \n",
        "Vanessa: ( Laughs ) well, because, actually, \r\nhe called me and suggest that I fly out. ",
        "Dinah: What? Wait a minute. I don't \r\nunderstand. ",
        "Vanessa: He called me and he said that \r\nalthough he was pretty sure you would deny it, he was pretty sure that you \r\nmissed your mom, so why didn't I come to Springfield for Christmas. And he had \r\neven actually looked up the flights. ",
        "Dinah: So Mallet didn't just suggest that you \r\ncome, he made it happen. ",
        "Vanessa: Now, wait a minute, honey. I didn't \r\nexactly need any prodding, you know. I've really missed you. So, you think you \r\ncan manage a little extra hug? ",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Come here. I can manage. \n",
        "Vanessa: Good. ",
        "Mallet: If I didn't know better, I'd swear \r\nyou two were related. ",
        "Vanessa: Hi, detective Mallet. ",
        "Mallet: How are you Mrs. Reardon? ",
        "Vanessa: Nice to see you. ",
        "Mallet: Nice to see you. And thanks for \r\ncoming. I'm glad you and your mom found each other. ",

        "Dinah: I believe her. ",

        "Mallet: Annoying? What's annoying? \n",
        "Dinah: Well, let's see. Every time I want to \r\nstrangle you, you go and do something nice. And I'm super ticked off you that \r\ndragged me out here tonight for whatever you call this. This um... ",
        "Mallet: I think it's a date. She said it was \r\na date. I think it's a date. ",

        "Mallet: Well, hey, all I did was pick up the \r\nphone. I mean, it's easier than bringing you flowers-- not that I was going to \r\nbring you flowers, you know. ",
