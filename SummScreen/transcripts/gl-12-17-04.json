        "Alan: Now... now why don't you just make yourself comfortable?",
        "Olivia: What is this, Alan?",
        "Alan: This? This is the room that Phillip was confined in. Surely you remember. You're the one that put him in it. Now it's your turn.",
        "Olivia: You're serious. You want to have me committed?",
        "Alan: Oh, yes. It's already been arranged.",
        "Olivia: No, no, you can't pull this off. You can't convince an entire hospital staff to go along with this.",
        "Alan: I don't need an entire staff. Just a few key players... who've already been paid off. Yes, and you will never walk out that door unless you give me what I want.",
        "Olivia: Which is what?",
        "Alan: My granddaughter, Emma.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Ow. Oh, gosh, Edmund, that feels so good.",
        "Jonathan: Right feeling. Wrong guy. These hands have been known to work magic, ask Tammy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Hey, Billy. What's doing?",
        "Billy: Nothing.",
        "Josh: Are you okay?",
        "Billy: Yeah, I'm fine.",
        "Reva: I'm going to check my messages from the station to find out if they worked through that scheduling problem...",
        "Josh: That's an excellent idea. Thank you.",
        "Reva: ...For tomorrow's show.",
        "Josh: Thank you. All right, bring it on. Let's have it.",
        "Billy: Have what?",
        "Josh: Whatever it is that's eating you up inside. What is it?",
        "Billy: I'm in deep trouble, Josh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Stay the hell away from me!",
        "Jonathan: Who?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: So you have to die to save Buzz?",
        "Harley: Yes me Ruth, Frank.",
        "Frank: I'm sorry, Dad, but it's time.",
        "Buzz: Way ahead of you, Frank.",
        "Harley: Frank, don't do this.",
        "Frank: Frank Achilles Cooper, you're under arrest for the murder of Phillip Spaulding. I'll read your rights on the way to the station.",
        "Harley: It will be okay all right, Daddy? Everything will be all right. I promise. Okay. Okay. Okay. See. So I know exactly what I have to do. And you have to help me.",
        "Gus: What?",
        "Harley: You heard me before. Ruth has to die. And I can't do this by myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Okay, what's going on?",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Reva: Mommy to the rescue.",
        "Jonathan: She went psycho.",
        "Cassie: Your beloved son groped me!",
        "Reva: He what?",
        "Cassie: He came up from behind me and he put his hands all over me.",
        "Jonathan: Okay, is it even worth it for me to say my side or am I just automatically guilty?",
        "Reva: I'm not interested in a side here. I want the truth.",
        "Jonathan: Well, the truth is I guess I was stupid for trying to help.",
        "Cassie: Oh, my God. I don't believe you.",
        "Jonathan: Okay, next time you get a shoulder cramp, I'll be miles away. No problem.",
        "Reva: Wait. A shoulder cramp?",
        "Cassie: I came from jogging and I was stretching and I had a cramp in my shoulder.",
        "Jonathan: The cramp looked like it was hurting her so bad she was going to drop. You know, no problem. No worries. Next time I will step right over her body.",
        "Reva: Jonathan, you knew this wouldn't be appreciated. Are you trying to mess with her?",
        "Jonathan: Would you believe me if I said no?",
        "Cassie: No.",
        "Reva: Will you give Cassie and me a minute alone?",
        "Jonathan: Good idea. Good for you. Without me here you can spin this into sexual assault. Oh, yeah, in case she needs a little more work, it was the left shoulder.",
        "Reva: Jonathan, most women don't appreciate unsolicited massages.",
        "Jonathan: Most women you hang out with.",
        "Cassie: Now you're going to defend him?",
        "Reva: No. What he did was wrong. He never should have touched you like that. It was inappropriate.",
        "Cassie: It wasn't just the way he touched me. It was the sick pleasure he got out of it, and then he how he spun it around to make me look foolish and victimized, Reva.",
        "Reva: Well, something tells me, you're thinking about Tammy as much as about yourself.",
        "Cassie: How can I not? I mean when I see his smug face... oh, my God. But you know, I guess it doesn't bother you.",
        "Reva: I just said that Jonathan was wrong.",
        "Cassie: But you take his side whether you realize it or not.",
        "Reva: I am trying to find a way to get through to my son!",
        "Cassie: At what cost? No matter what it does to me, my family? Tammy? Okay. All right. I have a question to ask you. Maybe this will prove to me what side you're on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: What if I knew something that could help Buzz out, maybe even get him off?",
        "Josh: Okay. What do you know?",
        "Billy: No, I said, \"what if I know something.\"",
        "Josh: If you know something that could help Buzz, why wouldn't you use it?",
        "Billy: I would. If I could, I would.",
        "Josh: You're not making any sense, you know that.",
        "Billy: Okay.",
        "Josh: I ran into that Ruth Karloff woman. She looks pretty guilty to me.",
        "Billy: Well, you think could just tell somebody's guilt by looking at them?",
        "Josh: No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm just trying...",
        "Billy: Just listen to me. Bill came to me for the first time in a long time. He wants my help badly. Alan's trying to split him and Olivia up because Bill wants to adopt Olivia and Phillip's kid.",
        "Josh: He does?",
        "Billy: Yeah, yeah. But you see Alan has his heart set on Emma for his own, you know, like a little prize, kewpie doll.",
        "Josh: So Alan's wants Phillip's kid. That's no surprise.",
        "Billy: Yeah, I want to make it good with Bill and me. I want to fix things up. The problem is that... you see, Buzz...",
        "Josh: Billy. Billy, I don't know what's going on with you right now, but I know this. You have got to do the right thing. And you know it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: You have no claim to my little girl. Get out of my way.",
        "Alan: No. Of course I have claim. She's my granddaughter. Her father is gone now and it's my responsibility to make sure that she is raised properly.",
        "Olivia: Properly. That's code for Spaulding, right?",
        "Alan: Emma should and will be raised with the best. Now did you honestly expect me to stand by idly while Bill Lewis attempts to adopt her?",
        "Olivia: What?",
        "Alan: You mean you're surprised about this? You didn't know about this? Oh, my goodness, how touching, how romantic and unrealistic.",
        "Olivia: Bill wants to adopt Emma?",
        "Alan: Yes. But I'm not going to allow it.",
        "Olivia: He wants to be her father.",
        "Alan: It will not happen. And you will never leave this room. Do you hear me? Until you agree to my terms.",
        "Olivia: You're the one who should be in here because you are delusional.",
        "Alan: Listen to me. You claim to be a dedicated mother. Bill Lewis can't focus on anything more than a month at a time.",
        "Olivia: You're wrong, Alan. He loves her.",
        "Alan: Phillip would never allow him to adopt his own daughter.",
        "Olivia: My daughter. And that is why I am standing here and trying to protect the family standards. You have no idea. I'm a good mother. Ever since Emma was born I have bent over backwards to give her a stable life.",
        "Alan: Yes, by keeping her away from her own father.",
        "Olivia: I wasn't keeping her from Phillip. It was Lizzie. Lizzie was the threat.",
        "Alan: Excuses, lies. That is exactly why she should be with us.",
        "Olivia: You should be happy I found someone as dear and kind and loving as Bill. That is a man that Emma can look up to.",
        "Alan: It will never happen, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: You have no say in who raises my daughter.",
        "Alan: You don't seem to be listening to me. You will give me what I want, or I will take it. Do you understand? Those are your choices. So why fight it?",
        "Olivia: No. Wait. Wait. Alan? Alan? God! (Breathing heavily) God! No!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Look I know what you're thinking.",
        "Harley: Okay, then just help me with it. I'm not going to let my father go to prison for shooting Phillip.",
        "Gus: I don't think that...",
        "Harley: I won't do it.",
        "Gus: I don't think your father's guilty.",
        "Harley: It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter whether he is or he isn't. Even if the jury were to exonerate him in the end, he may not make it through a trial. His heart may give out. Even he knows that. He was in there writing his will. He's already talking like he's dead.",
        "Gus: This plan that you have with Ruth...",
        "Harley: As far as we know, she did it. I did it.",
        "Gus: Don't say that.",
        "Harley: All we have to do now is convince the police that she did it. And then she has to go. It's the only way to take the pressure off my father. The tricky thing is, Ruth's death has to be 100% convincing, or it won't work. The good news is, I know exactly how to set this up. The key here is in the confession. If Ruth flat out admits that she killed Phillip and everybody buys it, my father is off the hook. She's, oh, so distraught about shooting Phillip. She's eaten up with her own guilt and she's terrified and she will be tracked down and thrown in prison to rot. She takes her own life. It's totally plausible.",
        "Gus: So you want to fake your own death?",
        "Harley: Exactly. We go out to the Old Williams bridge. Ruth videotapes her confession, we rig it to look like she's jumped... Then we throw an old log or something in the water. The sound of the splash is heard on the tape. That current is so strong, they'd never find a body. Then all we have to do is make sure the tape ends up in the right hands-- namely Frank's. Once he sees it, he'll release my father before he even gets a chance to hit rewind. It will work. It can work. It's fast, it's simple, it's fool proof. It's everything we need. What do you think?",
        "Gus: I think you're totally losing it. I can't... I can't help you with something like this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: How can I help? What can I do?",
        "Billy: You can't. It's something I've got to do. I've got to make a decision.",
        "Josh: Are you sure about that?",
        "Billy: Yeah, yeah. I mean, look, Phillip's death has got this whole town turned upside down. Buzz arrested by his son. Good old Olivia, the papers are crucifying her, making it look like she's done it.",
        "Josh: My guess is that Alan's pushing that theory.",
        "Billy: A lot of lives are getting ruined here, and I just thought if... If...",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Billy: Do you think we learned from this whole Maryanne mess that we got involved with this year?",
        "Josh: I sure hope so.",
        "Billy: Yeah, me, too. I'll see you later.",
        "Josh: Wait a minute. Where are you going?",
        "Billy: I'll tell you about it when I do it, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Bye. We have to talk.",
        "Jonathan: Why don't you just wheel over a chalkboard and I'll write \"I will not massage Cassie's shoulders,\" like, a thousand times and we can just be done with it.",
        "Reva: Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: What? Go ahead. Take your sister's side, I don't care. But just spare me the tongue- lashing or whatever you promised her that you'd lay on me.",
        "Reva: What Cassie asked me to do...",
        "Jonathan: I don't care! I don't care! Look, maybe it would just be better for everyone if I just disappeared.",
        "Reva: You know, it's funny you should mention that. Cassie and I weren't talking about your so-called massage. But she's very interested in you disappearing. For a night, anyway. The day of her marriage.",
        "Jonathan: She doesn't want me to go to her wedding.",
        "Reva: Yeah. She as much as asked me to ask you to stay away.",
        "Jonathan: Did you tell her to go to hell?",
        "Reva: No, I told her she was right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Can we move on to the next thing? There must be a cell with my name on it or something?",
        "Cop: Chief, you want me to take him downstairs?",
        "Frank: Actually, put him in the interrogation room, please.",
        "Cop: Okay.",
        "Buzz: More questions?",
        "Frank: Cosmo, get him settled. I got some things to sort out.",
        "Cop: Right this way, sir. I'm just wondering how do you want to deal with this situation?",
        "Frank: Well, how about this? You do your job and I'll do mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: So you won't help me?",
        "Gus: No.",
        "Harley: I can't do this without you.",
        "Gus: Well, good. Then you're not going to do it, right? Say that.",
        "Harley: What? What? What? What is your problem?",
        "Gus: What is your problem? You've lost every bit of common sense that you ever had.",
        "Harley: Well, trying to keep my father out of prison makes me illogical or...",
        "Gus: I don't want your father going to prison.",
        "Harley: Then help me with this.",
        "Gus: Not like this. No. I'm not.",
        "Harley: I told you. It's so logical. The plan is all mapped out.",
        "Gus: Yeah, I know. You told me your plan, that's great. Can I point out a couple of flaws in your plan? Please? Did you ever think what could happen to you if you put this ruth fat suit back on again?",
        "Harley: Yeah. I might actually save my father's life.",
        "Gus: No. Your brother, the chief of police, has taken an apb out on you, which means that every cop, every state trooper across the country has got your alter ego, big-schnoz picture plastered right on their dashboard.",
        "Harley: I won't get caught.",
        "Gus: Okay? And listen to you. You're that cocky? You're that confident, huh?",
        "Harley: I'm not just confident. I'm good.",
        "Gus: And then when they do bust Ruth and bring her down to the police station, what then? They rip the fat suit off your body and then what? But that's nothing-- nothing-- compared to what you really should be worried about.",
        "Harley: Which is what?",
        "Gus: A rookie cop comes nose- to-nose with a suspected killer, a murderer. And they don't think, they just get nervous. They pull their gun out and they shoot you. And you're out there trying to save your father, and is that part of your master plan, to get killed? C asking me to do this is like asking me to put the gun right in the rookie's hand and just pull the trigger. I can't... I can't... I can't do something like that. I can't. I can't say yes to something like that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: So you won't help me.",
        "Gus: That's it. (Cell phone rings) hello? When? Now? Okay. Yeah, we're on our way. Let's go.",
        "Harley: Where?",
        "Gus: That was Frank. We've got to go down to the station. Buzz is being processed. Look, he needs his lawyer, so let's...",
        "Harley: Well, you should go.",
        "Gus: What, now you're not going?",
        "Harley: I'm not his lawyer.",
        "Gus: Yeah, well, I'm sure that your father wants you there, anyway.",
        "Harley: So I can do what? Stare at him through the bars? Watch him while he lies on his bunk? No. I can't do that right now. Maybe tomorrow.",
        "Gus: Now is when he needs you.",
        "Harley: Well, now is when my kids need me, too. I have to get home.",
        "Gus: All right, fine. Whatever. Is that where you're going to be, if I need to get in touch with you? You're going to be at the boardinghouse, whatever?",
        "Harley: You should go. He's waiting.",
        "Gus: Look, can you just... just say to me that you're not going to do anything crazy.",
        "Harley: (Scoffs) Oh, me do something crazy? Oh, please. I am a pillar of...",
        "Gus: Because I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose you to a bullet. Or to a jailhouse. I care about you, you know? And I worry about you. And if that just means even, like, a little bit, just think about what you do, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Hi, there. How was your run?",
        "Cassie: Well, it was great at the beginning, but then... have you seen Reva?",
        "Josh: She's inside with Jonathan. They're talking about something that looks pretty intense. I figured three would be a crowd. I hate to be the one to break it to you, but I think they were talking about you.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Do you think I'm a jerk?",
        "Josh: (Laughs) No. I don't. What is that about? What's going on with you?",
        "Cassie: I told Reva I don't want Jonathan coming to my wedding.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Cassie: I know... I know that he's new for her, and I know that he had a really bad childhood and she wants to rescue him, but I can't stand the thought of him being there when Edmund and I exchange vows.",
        "Josh: What did she say?",
        "Cassie: She said she understood, but I know she doesn't.",
        "Josh: I wouldn't worry about it if I were you. Reva just needs a little time, that's all. She'll understand.",
        "Cassie: You think so?",
        "Josh: You know, Billy and I were just talking about lessons that we've learned in our lives. I've always tried to control people--my kids, my crazy wife--and this lesson I've learned: Some things just have to happen.",
        "Cassie: Can we let that happen with Jonathan?",
        "Josh: I just think that even Reva will eventually understand Jonathan and see him for who he really is.",
        "Cassie: I hope so.",
        "Josh: And just for the record, you didn't do anything wrong at all.",
        "Cassie: Thanks.",
        "Josh: Well, except one little thing.",
        "Cassie: What's that?",
        "Josh: You should have let me be the one to tell Jonathan he can't come to your wedding. That would have been the high point of my day. (Laughter)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Look, Jonathan, the bottom line is that it's Cassie's wedding. It's her day, it's her call.",
        "Jonathan: But she's afraid I'm going to ruin it?",
        "Reva: I love my sister and she's getting married in a few weeks and that makes me happy, because it's what she wants, even though a part of me wishes she'd wait until spring or summer.",
        "Jonathan: Hy?",
        "Reva: Because then maybe things would be different between the two of you. For all of us. I mean, obviously, she's still a little raw about what happened between you and Tammy, to the point where the two of you can't even be in the same room together, proving what happened just outside. And you're not making things any easier.",
        "Jonathan: I'm sorry.",
        "Reva: No, I don't think you are. But I'm hoping that that will change with a little time, maybe some effort.",
        "Jonathan: Well, gee, you really think there's hope for little ol' me?",
        "Reva: As a matter of fact I do. Otherwise I wouldn't have asked you to move in with Josh and me.",
        "Jonathan: That wasn't out of guilt?",
        "Reva: I asked you to move in because...",
        "Jonathan: Why?",
        "Reva: Because you're my son and I really want you to have the kind of life you deserve.",
        "Jonathan: (Laughs) That could be taken as a threat.",
        "Reva: Nothing really comes easy for you, does it?",
        "Jonathan: Hey, look who's talking.",
        "Reva: Do we have an understanding?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Yeah. You go to your sister's wedding with Josh and Marah and Shayne, and every other member of this family except me.",
        "Reva: Jonathan...",
        "Jonathan: No, it's fine. Your sister wants to marry the guy that wanted me dead from birth. Hell, why would I want to be there?",
        "Reva: Edmund's changed.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, right. That's the company line. But I'm not sure that you buy it. Not that it matters. You have to be by Cassie's side when she ties the knot. You love her. Funny about love, huh? Just bring me a hunk of that wedding cake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: How stupid am I to get tricked like this? I never should have come back here. Never. Alan! You're enjoying this, aren't you? Open the door! It just never ends, does it, Phillip? The family grip. I thought when you died, things would change, and they have changed, haven't they? They've gotten worse. Oh, God. If I could just go back to that night. If I could just redo what I...",
        "Alan: Please, please. Continue. I don't want to stop your stream of consciousness. I mean, this is the perfect place. What were you about to say? Come on. The night... what you would do differently the night that Phillip was murdered. What would you do? Use a higher caliber gun?",
        "Olivia: I didn't kill him. I wish I could change the way that night ended, Alan. I would have tried to save him.",
        "Alan: I don't believe that.",
        "Olivia: Why did you come back? I thought the idea was to leave me here for the rest of my life.",
        "Alan: And that's what I will do if you continue to fight.",
        "Olivia: Oh, I think I get it. You want to soften me up so I don't stick up for Bill when he wants to adopt Emma.",
        "Alan: Emma is a Spaulding. Letting a Lewis adopt her goes against nature.",
        "Olivia: The world according to Alan!",
        "Alan: Bill Lewis will never adopt Emma, no matter what. Now, admit it, because if you don't, this time when I walk out that door, it will stay closed.",
        "Olivia: You win.",
        "Alan: Excuse me? I don't think I heard what you said.",
        "Olivia: I said you win. You win, you miserable bastard!",
        "Alan: Ah! That I heard.",
        "Olivia: Let's open the door, Alan. I gave you what you wanted.",
        "Alan: No, because a few details need to be worked out, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: What are you after? Blood?",
        "Alan: I just want to know what you're going to say to Bill to tell him that he won't be Emma's Daddy.",
        "Olivia: Well, that's easy. I'll just tell him that you're a heartless, sadistic sob, and I realize that if I didn't want to lose my daughter completely, I had to do what the great and powerful Alan commanded. How's that?",
        "Alan: Leave me out of it. I don't want Bill blaming me.",
        "Olivia: You want me to make Bill think this is what I want?",
        "Alan: Hm.",
        "Olivia: All right. \"Bill, about the adoption. I thought about your offer, and it was nice of you, but I'm just a little concerned that it might confuse Emma as she gets older.\"",
        "Alan: No, that's too dry.",
        "Olivia: \"Bill, um, we're rushing things. Why do that? Why don't we just take our time, and then we'll talk about it later?\"",
        "Alan: Too equivocal.",
        "Olivia: What do you want? You want me to tell him to forget it?",
        "Alan: You're on the right track, Olivia. I just want you to drive the point home so that this issue will never come up again. Keep trying.",
        "Olivia: \"Bill, I won't let you raise my daughter. I don't think you're right for her, and I don't love you enough to have you be her father.\"",
        "Alan: Make it \"my daughter with Phillip.\" The real father should be mentioned in there somewhere.",
        "Olivia: Bill is never going to believe any of this.",
        "Alan: Why not, Olivia? You're a marvelous salesman. Why, you made me believe that you would be a loyal and loving wife at one time.",
        "Olivia: Are we done?",
        "Alan: I am.",
        "Olivia: Then open the door!",

        "Cassie: How did it go?",
        "Reva: He completely understood.",
        "Cassie: You sure about that?",
        "Reva: Yeah. I mean, I told him it wasn't a good idea, and that was that. So now you have to let it go.",
        "Cassie: Okay. I have another favor I need to ask you.",
        "Reva: Well, I am one busy girl tonight.",
        "Cassie: Well, I'm getting married in a few weeks, and there are a zillion things to do, and most important, I don't have a matron of honor.",
        "Reva: I'd love to.",
        "Cassie: You have to share the job with Tammy.",
        "Reva: Oh, that makes it even better! Oh, that's great.",
        "Cassie: Oh, God, I'm so happy. I can't believe this wedding is really going to happen, you know?",
        "Reva: And it is. And it's going to be wonderful.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, it is. Okay, I have to get home. I do.",
        "Reva: Okay. Are you going to jog home? (Laughter) I have to find Josh. I'll talk to you, though.",
        "Cassie: Okay.",
        "Reva: Okay.",
        "Jonathan: Have no fear. I'm not in massage mode. I just wanted to give this to you. Since I won't be at your wedding, and I figured I'd save myself the postage. So, here. Come on, here. Look. I know I've caused you a lot of problems. I know that. All right, here's the deal. I don't want to keep making the same mistakes. I want to move on to new ones. (Laughs) Kidding. No? Okay. I just feel like things have gotten so rotten, and I wanted you to know that I'm trying to figure out how to put all those problems behind us. So... happy wedding, or whatever they say.",

        "Buzz: Ah, more good news.",
        "Gus: Well, I just don't think I can get your bail hearing set until the morning.",
        "Buzz: Hey, it's murder. What judge is going to grant me bail?",
        "Gus: Come on, now. I'm trying my damnedest.",
        "Buzz: Well, I won't hold my breath.",
        "Gus: Why are you talking like that? Come on, now. You're a fixture in this town.",
        "Buzz: Oh, yeah. I'm a fixture like a sewer or a speed bump.",
        "Gus: Buzz Cooper. Everybody knows your name. That's got to count for something, right?",
        "Buzz: You know what they know about me? They know I run fast and far at the first sign that something's dicey. I mean, ask Harley. Ask Frank.",
        "Gus: That's ancient history.",
        "Buzz: History tends to repeat itself, you know. Of course, my motorcycle is in rotten shape, so that evens up the odds. You know, I wonder how many cases would have gone unsolved if they hadn't invented ink.",
        "Gus: This crime has not been solved. That's for sure, okay? And you, you are a long, long way away from being convicted.",
        "Buzz: Where's Harley?",
        "Gus: She's down at the boardinghouse, taking care of Jude and Zach. She said she'd come down in the morning, if that's okay.",
        "Buzz: Okay.",
        "Gus: Buzz, it's going to be okay.",

        "Gus: I'm going with you.",
        "Frank: No, you're not.",
        "Gus: Come on, Frank.",
        "Frank: You're staying right here with my Dad. Unit three, what's your 12?",
        "Gus: Cooper, what have you done?",
        "Buzz: What's going on?",

        "Josh: You think?",
        "Reva: Yeah. I mean it's going to take a while for him to totally come around. I mean he's a sensitive kid.",
        "Josh: Sensitive?",
        "Reva: Look, I know he doesn't belong at that wedding. I know that. But excluding him is only going to make it worse. I think the more we, you know, make him a part of all of this the safer he's going to feel with us.",
        "Josh: You know, there's a lot of people that don't really feel safe around him.",
        "Reva: I know that, especially when it comes to Tammy's case, but I also know that he's been hurt. I mean, being pushed away your entire life isn't a good thing, and I think the sooner we stop pushing him away and we start bringing him in, then he's going to know that life isn't just about rejection.",

        "Cop: Sir, unless you have some kind of official business, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.",

        "Billy: No, no. I actually do have official business. I'd like to talk to Buzz Cooper for a minute.",

        "Cop: Yeah.",
