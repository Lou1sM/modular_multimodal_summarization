        "Cassie: It's official.\r\n",
        "Richard: What's that? ",
        "Cassie: It's been three whole minutes. Peace \r\nand quiet. No one begging to stay up past their bedtime and no baby crying.\r\n",
        "Richard: And no Camille. I guess she stayed \r\nfor as long as she thought she had to, and then went home back to Iowa. \r\n",
        "Cassie: You were right. ",
        "Richard: What? ",
        "Cassie: You were right. ",
        "Richard: I hope so. You could say that a \r\nlittle louder if you'd like. It sounds nice. ",
        "Cassie: You were right. You were right.\r\n",
        "Richard: I was right. I was right. \r\n",
        "Alonzo: This is completely out of control. \r\nThere is no possible way I'm doing this. You can not do this to me! ",

        "\r\nBen: Haven't you forgotten something? ",
        "Marah: Yeah, the underlining economic causes \r\nfor the Civil War. Haven't you forgotten something? ",
        "Ben: Like? ",
        "Marah: Like how to knock? ",
        "Ben: Where are my manners? I'm sorry. \r\n",
        "Marah: So, what have I forgotten now? \r\n",
        "Ben: That we have a date. ",
        "Marah: A date? No, the only date I have is \r\nwith history. I have to finish this term paper. ",
        "Ben: We made plans to go skating around the \r\ntown for a Christmas tree. ",
        "Marah: I have no idea what you're talking \r\nabout. ",
        "Ben: You see, this is why I am the teacher \r\nand you are the student. Now, as I remember every year Springfield puts a \r\nChristmas tree up in the middle of Cobbler's pond. And when the pond freezes, \r\nit's traditional for college students to bundle up and go night skating. \r\nAfterwards, they cuddle up under blankets, drink hot chocolate or blackberry \r\nbrandy, and generally have a good time. (Laughter) Any questions? ",

        "\r\nTony: So, how did we do? ",
        "Catalina: Well, we're two cents short. So, \r\nhow about I put in my two cents, so we're even. ",
        "Tony: Nah, I think I still owe you. How about \r\nI buy you a drink? ",
        "Catalina: No, actually, I should get back to \r\ncampus. I have this history paper I got to write. ",
        "Tony: All right, well, I'll give you a ride.\r\n",
        "Catalina: No, you know, why don't you stay \r\nhere? You have work to do. ",
        "Tony: I'm fine. I'll take you back to your \r\ndorm. ",
        "Catalina: Why, Tony, so that maybe you can \r\nrun into Marah? ",
        "Tony: Wow. Now, what did I do to deserve \r\nthat? I thought I was doing something nice. ",
        "Catalina: You were. I'm sorry. It's just \r\nthat... I saw you two together at Towers, and the image has kind of been wearing \r\non me. ",
        "Tony: You saw us yesterday at Towers? \r\n",
        "Catalina: Yeah, yeah, I did. And maybe I \r\nshould have said something early... Earlier, but I thought you would think I was \r\nspying on you or something. ",
        "Tony: And were you? ",
        "Catalina: No, Tony, of course not. \r\n",
        "Tony: Now, Catalina, I'm a pretty straight \r\nahead kind of guy. If there's something you want to ask me, go ahead and ask.\r\n",

        "\r\nHarley: You lied to me. Not once, not even twice, but over and over again.\r\n",
        "Gus: Cooper, it wasn't so much a lie as a \r\nsubtle massaging of the truth, okay? ",
        "Harley: Give me a break, massaging? Give me a \r\nbreak. You told me you quit the FBI and you were working undercover the whole \r\ntime. That's a lie. That would be called a lie. ",
        "Gus: All right! From here on out, no more \r\nlying... ",
        "Harley: Your twisted grudge against Danny \r\nSantos, your sick quest for justice, I've had it with you. I have had it. You \r\nknow, you can't trust me with the truth, fine. You can be on your way. What, is \r\nthis funny? ",
        "Gus: No. ",
        "Harley: Is that a smile? ",
        "Gus: No, it's just a... Encouragement. It's \r\nnot so much that I lied, that would have been okay. It's that I lied to you, \r\nright? And... and I\u2019m touched. I just... It gives me hope for the two of us.\r\n",
        "Harley: There is no hope for us, none. \r\n",
        "Gus: Well, what are you getting so worked up \r\nover me for? ",
        "Harley: Because I am afraid that you are a \r\npathological liar, really. I mean you are... You are a law enforcement \r\nchameleon. You have been so many colors, I don't even know what side you're on \r\nanymore. What side are you on? ",
        "Gus: I'm on my side! Mine. Care to join me?\r\n",
        "Harley: No, because I can't trust you. \r\n",
        "Gus: Oh, like you've ever had a partner that \r\nyou can trust. What your big doofus brother, Frank or what was his name, Dave? \r\nDave, is that his name? ",
        "Harley: David. ",
        "Gus: These guys treat women cops like they're \r\n\"can-yous\" and you know it. ",
        "Harley: \"Can-yous?\" ",
        "Gus: Yeah, can you get me a file? Can you get \r\nme a donut? Can you make my coffee black? ",
        "Harley: I get it, I get it. Okay, I get it. \r\nAnd you are so off base about that. ",
        "Gus: I am the best... The best partner you \r\nhave ever had. ",
        "Harley: Yeah, right. ",
        "Gus: Yeah, I have. Who was there for you? Who \r\nhas taught you a few things about surveillance in the van back in the day? Who \r\nwas there for you when you gave birth to your baby? Who was there? ",
        "Harley: Who wanted you there? ",
        "Gus: Yeah, but I was there, right? I was \r\nthere. And what does that tell you? ",
        "Harley: You stole the father's cell phone for \r\nyour own self-interest... ",
        "Gus: I didn't steal his phone! Are you \r\nkidding me? I answered the phone by accident. That's all I did. And I was going \r\nto give him the message, but the guy was acting like a jerk, a jerk! And I \r\ndidn't even... I didn't know that you were in a prison. What, is he still saying \r\nstuff about that? Is he still complaining about it? I will meet him in the \r\nparking lot at 3:00 in the afternoon... ",
        "Harley: I don't want that. I don't want that. \r\nI don't want that and I don't want glib, okay? And I don't want, you know, here \r\ntoday gone tomorrow. I don't want that. I want somebody who will be here for me \r\nalways. And who will tell me the truth always. ",
        "Gus: Okay. ",
        "Harley: And who is kind. And you know what? \r\nYou fail in all counts. ",
        "Gus: Then you should be with Rick. \r\n",
        "Harley: Rick is a great guy... ",
        "Gus: Go with it. ",
        "Harley: ...Who does not lie, I might add. And \r\nif Rick would marry me tomorrow and we could raise that child together, I'd do \r\nit in a second. ",
        "Gus: Well, then seal the deal! Go on, beat \r\nit! Go... go... Go be with the guy! Go on! What's stopping you? ",
        "Harley: Nothing anymore. ",

        "\r\nCassie: What... What's wrong? ",
        "Alonzo: You can't do this to me. ",
        "Cassie: Do what to you? ",
        "Alonzo: You can't make me sleep in the \r\npresidential suite. ",
        "Richard: Not to your liking? ",
        "Alonzo: No, it's not. It's... it's too quiet.\r\n",
        "Cassie: Too quiet? ",
        "Alonzo: Yeah, it's too quiet. And the list \r\ngoes on from there. The bed is too big. The sheets are way too soft, and the \r\nmaids, they keep coming in and asking if I need anything. I tell you what I \r\nneed. ",
        "Cassie: What's that? ",
        "Alonzo: I need to get back out to sea. \r\n",
        "Cassie: You can't do that. You just had \r\nsurgery. ",
        "Alonzo: I don't think you can stop me. \r\n",
        "Richard: No, but your surgeon certainly can. \r\nI don't know what ship is going to commission you without your surgeon's \r\napproval. ",
        "Alonzo: I need to get out of this place. No \r\noffense. But I've done all I can do here. Will's fine. It's time for me to go. I \r\nwant to hear the waves slapping at the side of my boat, not the changing of the \r\nguard at the palace gates. And besides, I feel like the third wheel. The two of \r\nyou don't have any privacy with me around. ",
        "Cassie: Without you, we wouldn't have a \r\nhealthy son, so. ",
        "Richard: The problem is he's starting to like \r\nit here. He's too comfortable. ",
        "Alonzo: Yes, yes, yes. He's right. I'm \r\ngetting soft. It used to be that I could fight a 20-knot wind, just hanging up \r\nin the webbing of my mizzenmast. Now, I can't even stand up to the two of you.\r\n",
        "Cassie: See, that's because we're more like a \r\nhurricane than a wind. ",
        "Alonzo: Fine, fine, spoil me rotten if you \r\nwill. But tomorrow, once the doctor clears me, I\u2019m out of here. ",

        "\r\nRick: No, Mel, that was a great idea to test for that particular virus. \r\n",
        "Mel: Well, it would have been a good idea if, \r\nyou know, I would have been right. ",
        "Rick: That's not true. You know, this is all \r\na step up the ladder of figuring out what this thing is and what we're dealing \r\nwith here. ",
        "Mel: I think you need to bring in someone \r\nwith more experience. You know, someone who might be able to skip some of the \r\nrungs of the ladder. ",
        "Rick: I've already done that. ",
        "Mel: You have? ",
        "Rick: Sure. Look, there's a young man's life \r\nat stake here, you know. There's much more experienced specialists out there \r\nthat can help us out. I have no problem with that, but no matter how many \r\nspecialists we bring in, Mel, this is... This is our case, okay. This is our \r\ncase and I\u2019m glad to be working with you on it, okay? ",
        "Mel: Well, I appreciate your faith, Rick, \r\nbut... ",
        "Rick: Mel, I'm not going to give you the Rick \r\nBauer ego booster tune-up right now. You don't need it and we don't have the \r\ntime. You have a sick man to deal with. ",
        "Mel: You're right. I'm sorry. ",
        "Rick: This is... This is... This is mind \r\nboggling, tedious work, and sometimes it's more about endurance and commitment \r\nthan experience. I need somebody who's good, and more important, I need somebody \r\nwho's not going to give up. And there's no question in my mind that you're that \r\nperson. Are you hearing me now? ",
        "Mel: Loud and clear. ",
        "Rick: Good. ",

        "Harley: No. Just watching you. Watching you \r\ntrash around, doing your thing, destroying your only friendship, destroying your \r\ncareer. Hell, your snitches... Hey, don't do that, don't do that... ",

        "Gus: Well, then, you know what? Get ready for \r\na long boring year. I picture you both in 40 years on a porch with your little \r\nfoldout chairs, as the big 18- wheelers go by, going, \"hey, hey, hey y'all.\" \r\nWaste of life. I give it a year. A year. ",
