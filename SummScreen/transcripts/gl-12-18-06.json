        "Jonathan: You don't get to do this.",
        "Tammy: I have to.",
        "Jonathan: You are the one who told me to go. You said that would be the right thing.",
        "Tammy: I love you. I was wrong about that. I have never stopped loving you.",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie is right inside.",
        "Tammy: Okay. Fine. Go back inside to her and let her lie to you some more then.",
        "Jonathan: What? What?",
        "Tammy: You don't have a real marriage. You share a baby and some space, okay? That's it.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy, what the hell?",
        "Tammy: You don't want to go back in there. You could have gone in and out five times by now, but you're still out here with me, aren't you?",
        "Jonathan: You're making this worse.",
        "Tammy: This is just the beginning. This is just going to get worse and worse because you and I both know that no matter how many times we try to end this, this is not going to end.",
        "Jonathan: Go, go. You do not get to do this to me anymore. You don't get to follow me. You do not get to show up where I am. You don't get to torture me like that, so stop.",
        "Tammy: Make me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Come on, Jonathan, where are you? It's our big night out. Uncle Rick, Frank, have either of you seen Jonathan?",
        "Rick: We don't hang out much these days.",
        "Frank: What's the matter, Lizzie? Lost your husband?",
        "Lizzie: No, of course not. He's around here somewhere. Oh, Marina, you have to help me find Jonathan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cal: How strong can I make your drink?",
        "Reva: Oh, not strong, no. Club soda. Please, sir.",
        "Cal: Who let the stiff in?",
        "Reva: Hey, I'm pacing myself. I already had a few at the party.",
        "Cal: Oh, yeah, heck of a party.",
        "Reva: Tell you had a real blast.",
        "Cal: Yeah. You know what my favorite part was? Was when I met your second ex, the one who's not dating your sister.",
        "Reva: I knew I shouldn't have dragged you over there. Have I completely scared you off?",
        "Cal: No. You know, dating two brothers, I mean, that's... that's not weird, is it?",
        "Reva: Actually, it gets weirder. I've been tangled up with a Lewis man just as... about as long as I can remember.",
        "Cal: Well, then, maybe it's time to get untangled, so you should get tangled with somebody else.",

        "Lillian: Oh, good lord!",
        "Alan: No, it's just me. Hello, Lillian.",
        "Lillian: Don't do this. If you push me, I'm going to push you back.",
        "Alan: I'm just out spreading a little holiday cheer; that's all. Now, you can't say no to that.",
        "Lillian: I told you not to come here. There's a restraining order.",
        "Alan: I just want to see Sarah; that's all.",
        "Lillian: I know what you want to do.",
        "Alan: Her mother and father aren't here, so what's the harm, huh?",
        "Lillian: Alan....",
        "Alan: How would you feel if you weren't allowed to see her, huh?",
        "Lillian: You stay right there.",
        "Alan: Hello there, gorgeous. You know, your mommy and daddy don't want me near you. But what they don't know won't hurt them, will it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Mm. These are really good. Who brought these?",
        "Josh: I think it was Buzz.",
        "Cassie: Well, the food's almost gone.",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: I would say this was a success.",
        "Josh: I would say so. The question is, how do we get rid of all these people?",
        "Cassie: Some host you are.",
        "Josh: The host wants to be alone with you.",
        "Cassie: Oh, he does, does he?",
        "Josh: Come here with me for just a second.",
        "Cassie: Oh, yeah. It's time to kick them all out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Lizzie, will you stop freaking out? He's around here somewhere.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. Where?",
        "Marina: I don't know. Maybe he's hanging out with R.J. or something.",
        "Lizzie: R.J.? Yeah, of course. I don't know why I didn't think of that.",
        "Marina: Well, we've checked everywhere down here, so why don't you go upstairs and see if they're playing video games?",
        "Lizzie: I don't need to check on him. I'm not one of those hovering wives, Marina.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Hey.",
        "Josh: Hi.",
        "Billy: Nice party.",
        "Josh: Thank you. And really glad you're here.",
        "Sheila: Yeah, I love this old farmhouse.",
        "Josh: Well, that's all Cassie. I'm a relative newcomer here.",
        "Billy: Here's to new beginnings.",
        "All: To new beginnings.",
        "Josh: You seem like you're in a very good mood tonight.",
        "Billy: I certainly am. It's all because of this young lady right here.",
        "Sheila: Oh! Has he always been such a charmer?",
        "Josh: Yes, as a matter of fact, and it used to get him into a lot of trouble.",
        "Sheila: Oh!",
        "Josh: Yeah, I could... I could tell you some stories.",
        "Billy: Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.",
        "Sheila: Oh, please do, yeah.",
        "Josh: I don't even know where to begin. Maybe... let's start with the college football hero days. They were pretty wicked.",
        "Billy: Josh, Josh, Josh, Josh. I don't want to scare her away.",
        "Sheila: Oh, please. I don't scare off that easily.",
        "Josh: Okay. Well, you and I will talk later.",
        "Sheila: Okay.",
        "Josh: And by the way, I want to say thank you. You're a good influence on my brother.",
        "Billy: You certainly are.",
        "Sheila: Oh, thank you.",
        "Billy: No, I'm serious. I... I haven't felt like this... I mean, I am my old self again.",
        "Josh: Well, that's a good thing.",
        "Billy: Yeah, it is. And I'll tell you something. We're going to go places with this company. You... you wait and see.",
        "Sheila: Yeah, that's all he talks about, being back at Lewis and working with you again.",
        "Josh: Really?",
        "Sheila: Yes, he does. And that's exactly how I like my guy: Driven and fun.",
        "Billy: Oh, yeah. (Laughs)",
        "Sheila: Don't forget the fun, okay?",
        "Billy: Hey, Josh, we went out two-stepping last night. I'm telling you, you and Cassie will have to come with us next time.",
        "Josh: Oh, yee-haw.",
        "Billy: Yeah!",
        "Josh: Yeah, I'll make sure to ask her about that.",
        "Sheila: So, do you want me to freshen up your drinks?",
        "Billy: No, I'm good, thanks.",
        "Josh: Nah, I'm fine, thanks.",
        "Sheila: I'll be back.",
        "Josh: Thank you very much. Yeah. She's too good for you.",
        "Billy: Everybody's too good for me. (Laughter)",
        "Josh: No, I'm very, very happy for you. You found yourself a good one there.",
        "Billy: Actually, Reva found her.",
        "Josh: Go figure.",
        "Billy: Yeah.",
        "Josh: You... you did a lot for Reva. Must be nice to have things be a little less crazy.",
        "Billy: For all of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cal: So what do you say we start our own little holiday party?",
        "Reva: Fa-la-la... (giggles) ...la-la... (laughs) ...la-la! Mm! Ah! Surprise. (Laughs) I really... I don't really think I'm ready for this just yet.",
        "Cal: Okay.",
        "Reva: No, really. (Laughs) Come on! I... I'm not. I... I seem to have lost my party girl edge. Now what do you think about that?",
        "Cal: Well, you should just ease into it.",
        "Reva: Maybe. You know, I always seem to marry the men I sleep with, anyway.",
        "Cal: Okay! Okay, all right then. Okay. So it's a good thing that we stopped where we did.",
        "Reva: What, you're not ready for a lifetime commitment?",
        "Cal: (Laughs) You know, it's just that I've... I've probably been divorced about as many times as you have. And, well, to tell you the truth, I'm still a little baffled that I have a lifetime ahead of me.",
        "Reva: You too, huh? I mean, a month ago, I thought I'd be pushing up daisies. And now look at me.",
        "Cal: Look at you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Can I hold her?",
        "Lillian: Oh, no, because you'd put her under your arm like a football and run out of here.",
        "Alan: Why would I do that? She's my family. She's our family, Lillian.",
        "Lillian: Oh, don't play that with me, Alan.",
        "Alan: Why are you so supportive of Jonathan and Elizabeth's sham of a marriage, anyway?",
        "Lillian: If you'd stop calling it a sham of a marriage, maybe you'd be allowed to see this precious little girl. Isn't that what you really want?",
        "Alan: Jonathan doesn't care about Sarah or Elizabeth. Why are you pretending they have this normal marriage? Of course, you've done that all your life, especially with your family.",
        "Lillian: Oh. Since I'm so good at pretending, I guess I'll just pretend you didn't say that. It's time for you to go.",
        "Alan: No, no, I apologize.",
        "Lillian: No, no, you're out of here.",
        "Alan: I just got here, Lillian.",
        "Lillian: You're lucky I invited you in. Now, get out of here.",
        "Alan: Wait, I've got all these gifts.",
        "Lillian: Do you want me to call the police?",
        "Alan: I've got these gifts to...",
        "Lillian: Come on. Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Hey, Cassie. Can I help?",
        "Cassie: Sure.",
        "Lizzie: These?",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Lizzie: Thanks for inviting us. It feels so good to be out. This is me and Jonathan's first night out without the baby.",
        "Cassie: Well, I'm glad you had a nice time.",
        "Lizzie: You should see Jonathan with Sarah. He's amazing.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, who... who'd have guessed it, huh?",
        "Lizzie: You and Josh seem happy. How did you get him to stop obsessing about his past? I could really use the advice. You and I are kind of in the same boat.",
        "Cassie: Lizzie, Tammy is my daughter. I'm not going to...",
        "Lizzie: Right. Yeah, right. How is Tammy? She looked a little freaked out when she walked in.",
        "Cassie: She's fine. She's... she's getting on with her life. Don't worry about her at all, really.",
        "Lizzie: Good. That's great.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: You are so... even though I know I shouldn't....",
        "Jonathan: Shh. I feel like I can breathe for the first time in months. I just want to touch you and smell you and taste you and just pretend there's no outside world, okay?",
        "Tammy: There isn't.",
        "Jonathan: There isn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cal: (Laughs) I'll split it with you.",
        "Reva: Oh, no. I've had way too much sugar as it is. Yuck! All I want to do is get up on this bed and jump up and down.",
        "Cal: I knew we were going to get this bed squeaking somehow.",
        "Reva: Would you get over here? You're missing the last part of the movie.",
        "Cal: Pay-per-view and candy bars. Where did I lose my edge?",
        "Reva: Probably about the time you lost your hair.",
        "Cal: You too, huh?",
        "Reva: Who said I lost my edge?",
        "Cal: Not me.",
        "Reva: Oh, see, it's over. Are you going to find me a ride home?",
        "Cal: If I have to.",
        "Reva: (Laughs)",
        "Cal: See? There is life after the Lewis brothers.",
        "Reva: I know there is. It's just weird, you know? Watching them go on with their lives. Without me. It's kind of like I really did die.",
        "Cal: Well, that can be freeing.",
        "Reva: I was the one who pushed Josh and Cassie together. I set Billy up with Sheila, kind of like a lovely parting gift.",
        "Cal: Billy's not really interested in Sheila, is he?",
        "Reva: Why?",
        "Cal: No reason.",
        "Reva: Why, Caleb?",
        "Cal: I've heard stories about Sheila. Billy could be in some real trouble.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: For you. There you go. (Laughter)",
        "Sheila: Yeah, we should get dinner soon.",
        "Cassie: We're there.",
        "Sheila: All right. And then we can go out dancing afterwards.",
        "Billy: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: Uh, dancing?",
        "Josh: Yeah, that's right. Billy and Sheila have taken up two-stepping.",
        "Cassie: Well, in that case, I'll have to dust off my cowboy boots. (Laughter)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Okay, ready sweetheart?",
        "Rick: As ready as I'll ever be, Frankie.",
        "Marina: Oh, my God. I... I'm going to get the coats.",
        "Frank: What are you stealing now?",
        "Lizzie: Jonathan's not upstairs. I've looked everywhere. He's not in the house.",
        "Marina: Well, did you try calling him?",
        "Lizzie: Yes. He didn't pick up the phone.",
        "Marina: Is his car here?",
        "Lizzie: Yes, but....",
        "Marina: Then he's around here somewhere, isn't he, Lizzie? Listen, from what I hear, Jonathan's not really big on the whole family gathering thing. There's no need for you to worry.",
        "Lizzie: How can I not worry? He disappeared.",
        "Marina: Let go of the leash, Lizzie. Listen, Jonathan is trying to do right by you and the baby, but you've got to give the guy a little bit of space.",
        "Lizzie: No, not tonight. Tonight, we are supposed to be together.",
        "Frank: Hey, Lizzie. What's the matter?",
        "Marina: Lizzie can't find her husband.",
        "Josh: Well, he was here earlier. Did you check, I don't know, R.J.'S room, maybe?",
        "Lizzie: Yes, yes, I checked there. He's not there.",
        "Marina: I told her it's no big deal. Here's probably just out taking a walk. Right?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I'm sure he'll show up.",
        "Rick: Lizzie, do you need a ride?",
        "Lizzie: No, Uncle Rick, I need my husband.",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: Josh?",
        "Josh: Okay, I'll get my coat and see what I can do.",
        "Frank: Josh, do you need help?",
        "Josh: No, no, that's all right. Go home. And thank you for coming.",
        "Frank: Thank you.",
        "Rick: Good food, great cookies.",
        "Cassie: Thank you for coming, sweetie.",
        "Rick: Thanks, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Good night.",

        "Tammy: I wish you could stay here forever, and I could just live in this barn.",
        "Jonathan: (Sighs) Yeah.",
        "Tammy: But we can't, can we? What are you thinking about?",
        "Jonathan: Sarah. I tried so hard to make everything as right for her.",
        "Tammy: You did. She's a very lucky little girl.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, we'll see in about 20 years.",
        "Tammy: We will see. I know it.",
        "Jonathan: Not with a dad like me.",
        "Tammy: Why are you being so down on yourself?",
        "Jonathan: Well, it's just not just about her. It's about you, too, you know? I wanted you to be proud of me.",
        "Tammy: I am proud of you. You love your daughter, and then look at everything that you've done already to make her safe and give her a good home.",
        "Jonathan: What does that matter if I ruin it?",
        "Tammy: How?",
        "Jonathan: (Scoffs) Never mind.",
        "Tammy: No, Jonathan. Why do you think you're going to ruin it?",
        "Jonathan: Doing this?",
        "Tammy: What?",
        "Jonathan: I can't. I can't be that guy. I tried.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan. Hey, you don't have to try to be anything, okay? I love you. More than ever. I can't even imagine my life without you in it.",

        "Frank: I'll make it.",
        "Rick: I tell you, if you wake up Harley and the boys, Harley will have your head. She threw a can opener at me the other day.",
        "Frank: Okay, I'll have a cup of milk. Anyway, do you have any of those cookies that you stole from Cassie's? I didn't eat much tonight.",
        "Rick: Yeah. The white ones were really good. There you go. That was a good party.",
        "Frank: Yeah, yeah. You know, it was. I was really dreading the party, you know, that whole Josh/Reva/Cassie thing. But, I don't know, it turned out all right.",

        "Lizzie: Just go. We're trying to have a life.",
        "Alan: You call living with him \"having a life\"?",
        "Jonathan: Do you see what you're doing to her? Do you see, Alan? She doesn't deserve that. She just wants to have a normal family for her kid. She doesn't want you coming...",
        "Lizzie: Just go. Go! Please.",
        "Jonathan: Maybe we should get out of here.",
        "Lizzie: Thanks for inviting us. I'm really sorry about all of this.",

        "Billy: He seems nice enough.",
        "Reva: Yeah, we're both lucky there, huh? Me and Cal, you and Sheila. What does she do for a living, anyway? I mean, does she live around here? Does she have family here or...",
        "Billy: Wait, what's the 20 questions for?",
        "Reva: Well, no, I'm just curious, you know? I mean, it takes a while to get to know somebody, and I just wondered how well you know her.",
        "Billy: Hey, what is this?",
        "Reva: Do you mind if I want to know a little bit about the person yourself dating?",
        "Billy: No, but I know that look. Hey, look, I'll make it easy for you. You did a good thing with Sheila, okay?",
        "Reva: You guys are moving fast.",

        "Rick: Well, hey, listen, Frank, I think it was hard way back when, when her grandparents made it look so easy. I mean, my Grandma Bert, greatest lady in the world, but I know that she had a tough time of it. Man, I miss her. I miss a lot of people this time of year.",

        "Reva: This isn't about me.",
        "Billy: Yes, this is always about you. Reva, look, you made it painfully clear that you weren't interested in me. So who I see and what I do with them is none of your business now, okay? Got it?",

He could be in a whole lot of trouble, and I just... he won't listen to me, and I thought maybe you could talk to him, and... what am I doing? I'm sorry. I don't... I don't mean to call you on something, it's just... you're always the one that always fixes things, so I... never mind. Forget about it. I'll handle it myself.",
