        "Alan: I haven't seen Harley in a long time. Does she miss me? Does she worry about what I might do to her when I get out of here?",

        "Rick: Hey, can I buy you a beer?",
        "Gus: Oh, um, actually, can I... can we stay out here for a minute?",
        "Rick: Yeah, sure. What's up?",
        "Gus: Rick, I intercepted a call from Alan a couple of days ago.",
        "Rick: So what?",
        "Gus: Well, he's making noise about being able to prove that he's sane now.",
        "Rick: Sure he's making noise. I mean, Alan wants to be a free man, right?",
        "Gus: Let me ask you something. You treated him there for a while. I mean, do you think it's in the realm of possibility?",
        "Rick: Here's the mother of my son!",
        "Harley: Ooh, it's freezing out here!",
        "Gus: Hey.",
        "Harley: Hi! ( Laughter ) what are you guys talking about?",
        "Rick: None of your business.",
        "Gus: Mental health. Mental health.",
        "Harley: Mental health? Yours or his?",
        "Gus: Everybody knows I'm crazy.",
        "Harley: Crazy in love.",
        "Gus: That's right. For you, only for you. ( Cell phone ringing )",
        "Harley: Okay, if this is work, I'm going to get rid of them so I can focus on you, you, you.",
        "Gus: No, do what you got to do, baby.",
        "Rick: What about me, me, me?",
        "Harley: You, you, you. Hello!",
        "Mallet: Hey, did I catch you at a bad time?",
        "Harley: Yeah, sort of. What's going on?",
        "Mallet: Um, I caught Marina going through the old files again today, and if I asked her about it, of course she'd deny it. It's... the thing is I think she's going to go out solo tonight, and I think she's going to get in over her head.",
        "Harley: Uh-huh. So what do you need me for?",
        "Mallet: I thought you said we were going to do a little stakeout thing.",
        "Harley: Oh, right! Uh... yeah. The problem is, things have sort of changed since then.",
        "Mallet: Harley Cooper, get on down here. It's cold in the car and I need some warming up.",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Mallet: It's cold. Bring some coffee down.",
        "Harley: Right, coffee, of course.",
        "Mallet: What did you think I meant?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Speaking of which, there's all this new snow. Let's go sledding.",
        "Cassie: You want to go now?",
        "Sandy: R.J. Says that hill behind the barn is the best.",
        "Jeffrey: Why not? I think it's a great idea. ( Laughter )",
        "Cassie: Are you up for this?",
        "Reva: Yeah, I am.",
        "Sandy: Where are the sleds?",
        "Jeffrey: In the barn. There's a whole bunch of them, too.",
        "Sandy: Cool. Let's go get them.",
        "Cassie: Okay.",
        "Reva: Come on.",
        "Cassie: Thanks. Well, where's Tammy?",
        "Sandy: She's out there somewhere. You know how much she loves the snow.",
        "Reva: I'll get the toboggan. No, no, no, because it's better to have...",
        "Josh: No, it's gonna be me. ( Laughter )",
        "Cassie: Get the hell off my daughter!",
        "Josh: Cassie! Cassie! Cassie! Cassie, Cassie...",
        "Cassie: Let me go! You monster!",
        "Josh: Cassie! You have to calm down and let us handle it.",
        "Cassie: I can't calm down!",
        "Josh: Let us handle it. Jeffrey, back off him.",
        "Jeffrey: What's your problem?",
        "Josh: Give him a chance to explain.",
        "Jeffrey: What's there to explain?",
        "Cassie: We all saw what he was doing. He waited. He waited, the sick freak, until she was at her most vulnerable.",
        "Reva: Jonathan, say something to defend yourself.",
        "Cassie: Stop it, Reva. Can't you see what he is?",
        "Reva: No, Jonathan, please.",
        "Josh: Jonathan, what, are you trying to go to jail? Come on!",
        "Reva: Jeffrey, let him go.",
        "Cassie: I don't care how much you love your rapist son, he's not going to get away with this...",
        "Tammy: Stop it. Stop blaming him. Jeffrey, let him go, right now.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm not hurting him, Tammy. We just don't want him to bolt, that's all.",
        "Tammy: He's not going to run. Just let him go. I mean it.",
        "Cassie: Tammy?",
        "Tammy: He wasn't attacking me, mom.",
        "Cassie: When we came in, he was...",
        "Tammy: I wanted that. I wanted to be with him.",

        "Mallet: Harley? Hello. Hello.",
        "Harley: It's work!",
        "Gus: Babe, it's fine. You do what you got to do, okay?",
        "Harley: Yeah.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: I don't want you standing out here freezing to death. Why don't you go inside, get more coffee? When I get rid of these people...",
        "Gus: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Harley: I'll come in and join you. It's work.",
        "Gus: That's what I need, more coffee. It's okay. Do what you've got to do.",
        "Harley: Thanks. Okay, I'm back. What'd Marina do this time? Is she in trouble?",
        "Mallet: Not yet.",
        "Harley: Okay, what file did she pull?",
        "Mallet: A suspected cop killer.",
        "Harley: And you let her go?",
        "Mallet: What was I going to do, lock her in the cage? She's a grown woman. Listen, she's probably going to be fine. It's just that, you know, she's been taking a lot of risks ever since this thing with Danny.",
        "Harley: I know. I know, I know. You know, some girls eat chocolate when their love life tanks, and Marina apparently turns into super cop.",
        "Mallet: Hmm. It must run in the family. Listen, you sound kind of busy. Why don't you go back to doing whatever you were doing and I'll... I'll watch Marina tonight all by myself. How's that?",
        "Harley: No. I mean, as much as I love the idea of you freezing your butt off in a van all alone, I'm in this with you. Where are you? I'll be right there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: So let me ask you something.",
        "Rick: Sure.",
        "Gus: Do you actually think it's possible that he could get off this soon, prove that he's sane?",
        "Rick: No, I have no idea, but I've never underestimated Alan's ability to crawl out of a squirrel hole.",
        "Gus: That's just perfect.",
        "Rick: Great Christmas present, huh?",
        "Gus: I'm not going to let it happen. It's not going to happen.",
        "Harley: Okay, don't hate me.",
        "Rick: Hey.",
        "Gus: What is it, work?",
        "Harley: It's work. I'm sorry.",
        "Gus: That's all right. Do what you got to do.",
        "Harley: Yeah? You're not going to try to talk me out of it?",
        "Gus: No, as long as you come home to me safe and sound.",
        "Harley: From Spaulding?",
        "Gus: From wherever.",
        "Harley: Oh, right. Aren't I married to the most wonderful man in the world? You're awesome. See ya!",
        "Rick: See ya. You're not going to tell her?",
        "Gus: What, are you taking a thermos with you? Going to plan a long night?",
        "Harley: Uh... you know what? It could be. Really. So don't wait up.",
        "Gus: All right.",
        "Rick: You're not going to tell her?",
        "Gus: It's probably nothing, you know. She needs to focus on her... her job at Spaulding and her kids, not some possible threat from Alan Spaulding.",
        "Rick: I mean, come on, do you really think that Alan would be a threat if he was released?",
        "Gus: I don't know, Rick. What do you think?",
        "Rick: I don't know. I'll talk to his doctors.",
        "Gus: Thank you.",
        "Rick: See you later.",
        "Buzz: Well, I'm glad he's confident.",
        "Gus: What did you hear?",
        "Buzz: From you, nothing new. But there is a regular that comes in here, and he's... he's an orderly at your father's loony bin. And he says that Alan is going to be up for a competency hearing.",
        "Gus: Yeah. Buzz, those things are just a formality.",
        "Buzz: I wouldn't be so sure. They're giving odds on it at the asylum.",
        "Gus: What's the line?",
        "Buzz: Even money. Alan gets out by New Year's.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Tammy, I don't understand. You can't be saying you actually wanted... why are you protecting him?",
        "Tammy: Listen to me, mom.",
        "Cassie: He's got you all turned around, honey.",
        "Tammy: No.",
        "Cassie: Maybe you're in shock. You must be in shock.",
        "Reva: She's not in shock.",
        "Cassie: Step away from him, and we'll figure this out, okay? Just you and me.",
        "Tammy: You're not listening to me, mom. I said I want to be with him.",
        "Cassie: No, honey, no, you don't. You couldn't possibly.",
        "Tammy: I know this is a shock. I know that this makes you sad. But I'm not crazy, mom. I'm not trying to protect Jonathan. This is how I feel.",
        "Cassie: Honey, you're confused.",
        "Tammy: No, I'm not confused. I know that what I'm feeling is real.",
        "Cassie: I don't believe this. This isn't happening. I don't believe this.",
        "Tammy: I didn't want to tell you, mom, because I knew that you would react like this.",
        "Cassie: React?",
        "Tammy: The truth is I couldn't admit even to myself how I felt. I'm glad you found us. I'm glad you know, because I'm sick of hiding and sneaking around. I'm the one who wanted to meet Jonathan in the barn tonight.",
        "Cassie: Oh, my God.",
        "Jonathan: You want to get out of here?",
        "Sandy: Forget it.",
        "Jonathan: Get the hell out of our way, Sandy.",
        "Sandy: Or what? Hmm?",
        "Josh: All right, okay, okay, okay. Hey, I want you to come to the house with me right now.",
        "Sandy: What?",
        "Josh: Come back to the house with me now. Cassie needs to talk to her daughter. Let's go.",
        "Sandy: Tammy, he's using you. Jonathan, if you give a damn about her, you'll just walk away. Walk away!",
        "Cassie: A few weeks ago, I found a snake in this barn. And I was scared at first, but I didn't panic. I picked up the shovel, and I killed it. I did what I had to do because it was a threat to my child. So you give me one good reason why I shouldn't use the shovel on you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Here.",
        "Mallet: Hey. All right! All right. About time. Something to wash these down with.",
        "Harley: What \"these\"? Oh, yeah, I smelled them the second I crawled in here.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, if chocolate frosting is wrong, I don't ever want to be right. You know, Dr. Doughnut, that place off of main street uses real...",
        "Harley: Real fudge chocolate frosting. I know. I grew up here.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, that's right. Well, let me tell you something else. Don't be licking the frosting off and then putting the doughnut back in the box. I'm on to you.",
        "Harley: Are you kidding me? You who used to suck the jelly out of the hole in the doughnut. How old are you?",
        "Mallet: Please, long gone days. I'm strictly into frosting. Are you smelling the box or are you smelling me?",
        "Harley: I think I'll stick to the coffee. Thank you very much. So what's the sitch? What's going down?",
        "Mallet: Marina's in the bar across the street, dog.",
        "Harley: You know, I busted a guy in there once. It's not good. You don't think they'll make her as a cop, do you?",
        "Mallet: She's young and she's pretty. So they'll want to think that they can get lucky with her before they ever think that she's a cop.",
        "Harley: Shockingly, that doesn't make me feel better.",
        "Mallet: ( Sighs ) well, let's just hope that she doesn't deal with a chip on her shoulder by playing hero like someone else I used to know.",
        "Harley: I wasn't playing hero.",
        "Mallet: Oh, you weren't... you were authentic. You were the real deal.",
        "Harley: Mm-hmm.",
        "Mallet: Well, let's just hope your taste for bar fights has diminished over the years.",
        "Harley: Why? Are you too scared to hang?",
        "Mallet: Oh, I can hang. I can get down with that. I'm in my prime. I'm... I'm a spring chicken.",
        "Harley: ( Laughs )",
        "Mallet: So what'd you tell your husband today?",
        "Harley: Those doughnuts are driving me nuts. Give me that box.",
        "Mallet: Here. Have a doughnut.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "( Christmas music playing )",
        "Gus: Oh, that's a little bit of heaven. You know, Buzz, for as long as I've been a cop, I've never gotten used to the system, how we just let criminals back out on the streets to hurt more people.",
        "Buzz: I don't care about people. I care about my people.",
        "Gus: That's what I'm saying. I... I care, too. I...",
        "Buzz: If Alan gets out, he's going to go after Harley.",
        "Gus: Well, I'm... that's what I'm saying, Buzz. How is that possible? How's it possible? He's been found insane, right? I mean, how's a judge going to...",
        "Buzz: Your honor, your honor, my client loves his son. He loved his son so much, I mean, how could he pull a trigger on his son? For him to pull a trigger on his own son...",
        "Gus: He would have had to have been insane, your honor.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, and we have medical experts that can attest to that fact, that he was temporarily mentally incapacitated.",
        "Gus: And that's why he's been in a medical institution, a psychiatric institution. Although he's had a great program and made remarkable success with his program, he is nuts.",
        "Buzz: Your honor, he's an old man. He's a pillar of...",
        "Gus: We don't let people in our society just out on the streets like this.",
        "Buzz: He... he lost his son because of his own mental incapacity. Hasn't he paid his debt to society?",
        "Gus: No. No. Not even close.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: This is crazy, leaving Jonathan in there with Tammy.",
        "Josh: Sandy, you relax.",
        "Sandy: He's got some kind of hold on her!",
        "Josh: Let Reva and Cassie deal with this. If this thing between Jonathan and Tammy is real...",
        "Sandy: It's not real. Of course it's not real.",
        "Josh: Why do you say that? Because she's not with you?",
        "Sandy: No!",
        "Josh: Look, I don't like this anymore than you do. But the look on Tammy's face right now...",
        "Sandy: That guy has been after her since...",
        "Jeffrey: Since?",
        "Josh: Go ahead, Sandy.",
        "Sandy: I caught them in the barn the night of the accident, and I thought Tammy would eventually realize Jonathan is just out to hurt anyone and everyone.",
        "Josh: You know, she didn't look much like a victim to me just now.",
        "Sandy: I know you don't trust me anymore, but that doesn't mean you should trust a guy like Jonathan.",
        "Josh: I don't, Sandy. But this is not about me, this is not about you. This is about Tammy and what she needs.",
        "Jeffrey: Or maybe Tammy's too blind to see who Jonathan is.",
        "Josh: Well, I happen to think Tammy's a whole lot like her mom, and then when it comes down to it, she's going to open her eyes and she's going to finally see the truth for what it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Honey, I think I know why you're acting out like this.",
        "Tammy: I am not acting...",
        "Cassie: Honey, you were just about to marry Sandy. You were so excited. And then your world just exploded. Of course. No wonder. No one can blame you for being lost and confused.",
        "Tammy: No. I'm not confused, mom. You are. You have no idea how Jonathan is with me. You think I made a mistake, but the mistake, mom, was lying to myself and to everyone else about Sandy, and denying what I feel for...",
        "Cassie: Don't. Don't say it.",
        "Tammy: I've been trying to tell you for weeks, that things have changed for me.",
        "Cassie: Honey, no. You haven't changed.",
        "Tammy: But my feelings have, my life, what I want.",
        "Cassie: Honey, you don't want him. You don't want this.",
        "Reva: What if she does?",
        "Cassie: She can't. Honey, this is the person who took so much from you, who lied to you. He lured you in. He came to this town to destroy your family, and he very nearly did.",
        "Tammy: He was, but I forgive him for that.",
        "Cassie: Honey, how can you forgive him?",
        "Tammy: You know what I felt when that wedding blew up, after all that anger and pain? Relief. Because I didn't have to go through the rest of my life with someone that I didn't truly love, because I wanted to be with Jonathan. How do you explain why you fall in love?",
        "Cassie: Honey, this is not love.",
        "Tammy: Yes, it is. I love him.",
        "Cassie: This is insane. Tell her this is insane. You bastard. You waited for her. You waited until she was at her weakest moment. You hung around and waited for your chance...",
        "Tammy: I've never felt stronger in my life, mom.",
        "Reva: Cassie, listen to what she's saying. I don't expect you to understand any of this, but just listen to what she's saying.",
        "Cassie: What she's saying is she's crazy. She is crazy to throw her life away like this. Is she that desperate?",
        "Jonathan: Oh, that's it! You want me to be bad, that's fine. This is your daughter. She knows what she wants.",
        "Reva: Jonathan...",
        "Jonathan: No, mom, no. Look, I'm everything you hate, Cassie. That's fine, I probably deserve it. I screwed up a lot in the past. I'm trying to fix it. Even though she says we're good, even though she says that she loves me, I love her for that. I love her for a hundred other reasons. There is not a damn thing you can do about it. Come on, Tammy.",
        "Cassie: Tammy, if you walk out that door, I will not be around to pick up the pieces.",
        "Tammy: Don't say that.",
        "Cassie: You say you're strong; you better be. Because if you go now, don't ever bother coming back.",

        "Harley: I mean, I was having these dreams.",
        "Mallet: Who, like, for example, was one of your leading men?",
        "Tammy: I broke my mother's heart tonight.",
        "Cassie: She's gone with him.",

        "Mallet: You said you didn't lie, and I said, \"okay.\"",
        "Harley: I didn't.",
        "Mallet: So why didn't you tell him what was really going on tonight?",
        "Harley: Because I didn't want to worry him, okay?",

        "Buzz: So you're not going to tell Harley about Alan?",
        "Gus: No, no.",
        "Buzz: Do you think that's a good idea? It hasn't worked out in the past.",
        "Gus: I think it's a good idea. Why get her all upset about something I can handle? Spaulding Enterprises needs her, Buzz. The kids, they need her attention, her focus.",
        "Buzz: All I care about is that my daughter and her kids are safe.",
        "Gus: I am doing this...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: For Gus' own good.",
        "Mallet: See, this is why I'm not married.",
        "Harley: This is not why you're not married, sweetie. And for your information, Gus and I for weeks have been pretending to fight.",
        "Mallet: You've been pretending to fight? Why?",
        "Harley: It was a tactic, to smoke out my enemies at Spaulding.",
        "Mallet: You can't figure out who your enemies at Spaulding are? Um... Alan. Uh... Beth. Uh... Alan.",
        "Harley: Okay. I mean smoke out what they were up to. But my point is-- sarcasm-- my point is that the act is up and Gus and I have never been closer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Look, I'm all for, like, a happy Aitoro/Cooper Christmas. But if Alan gets out and goes after Harley...",
        "Gus: He's not getting out. He's not getting out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: I never realized what a... what a good actress you were. You're a good actress. I mean, I thought that maybe you were actually pulling away from Gus.",
        "Harley: I had to be convincing.",
        "Mallet: Interesting.",
        "Harley: And I'll tell you something. I was really playing that miserable newlywed thing, and I got into it. I got into it a lot more than I thought I would. I mean, I was having these dreams.",
        "Mallet: Really? You were having dreams?",
        "Harley: Uh-huh. Like... like Julia Roberts, you know? Because she's an actress and, you know, she dreams about the characters that she's playing and sometimes, you know, her leading men. But that's what actresses have to do because it makes it more real for them.",
        "Mallet: Mm-hmm. That makes sense. So who, like, for example, was one of your leading men?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Josh, do you have a problem with me?",
        "Josh: No, I don't.",
        "Jeffrey: We're still friends?",
        "Josh: Yeah, we're still friends.",
        "Jeffrey: You've been giving me a lot of unfriendly looks alluding to something. I don't know what. But if there is a problem, maybe you should just, you know, spit it out.",
        "Josh: Look, Jeffrey, right now I think what we need to focus on is Tammy and her needs.",
        "Sandy: And she is confused and she doesn't know what she needs or wants. So I'm going to go talk to her.",
        "Josh: No, don't you think you've already done enough, Sandy?",
        "Sandy: What does that mean?",
        "Josh: I don't think it was just a coincidence we happened to walk in on Jonathan and Tammy in the barn just now. It was your idea to go sledding, wasn't it?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, at least it got everything out into the open. The truth is out there, so that's what's important.",
        "Josh: Yeah, it's usually a good thing for the truth to get out, isn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Tammy, you just have to understand how upset your mother is right now. You just have to understand that.",
        "Tammy: I understand she's forcing me to make a choice.",
        "Reva: No, no, she's not.",
        "Cassie: Yes, I am. And you don't have to talk for me, Reva. You can't make things all better.",
        "Tammy: Mom, look at me. Listen to me. I'm a woman, all right? Not just your little girl.",
        "Cassie: Honey, there are consequences to your actions when you become a woman. And if you let Jonathan control you, if you let him rip you away from everyone that you love...",
        "Tammy: He isn't doing that!",
        "Jonathan: The only person trying to control Tammy here is you. You tell her she can't come home. Remember when I was sitting in Tammy's wedding in the church? I sat there and she married another guy?",
        "Cassie: What's the point?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, yeah, your little golden boy, the groom, the guy who was perfect for Tammy. It turns out he's still married to another woman.",
        "Cassie: You think you can twist this all around and make yourself into the good guy?",
        "Jonathan: It doesn't matter. Good guy, bad guy, whatever I am, Tammy, she wants to be with me and I want to be with her, and that's all that matters. Come on, Tammy.",
        "Cassie: Tammy! Don't go!",
        "Tammy: I love you, mom.",
        "Cassie: Tammy! Tammy! Baby! Tammy! ( Sobbing )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Okay, so you may have been a, you know, like a participant in... in... in my dreams. It's no big deal.",
        "Mallet: So I was... I was actually in this play in your head? Did I have a part? Was it a big part?",
        "Harley: Could you get over yourself?",
        "Mallet: Does Gus know about these dreams? Or are you keeping these dreams from him for his own good... again?",
        "Harley: You know, they were just dreams, okay? And for your information again, once we stopped acting like we hated each other, the dreams went away. So, see? It's no big deal. It's just dreams. It's just dreams. And I'm not going to mess up this good thing that I have going with my husband by telling him something that doesn't even matter. Did I eat all of these? How many were in this box? Mallet: Half a dozen. It's nice to see you're still a rock of self- control, and it's nice to know that I can't tempt you anymore. ( Cell phone ringing )",
        "Harley: Hi, sweetie.",
        "Gus: Hey, how's it going?",
        "Harley: Uneventful.",
        "Gus: Really? I was thinking about coming over there and making it eventful.",
        "Harley: No, don't do that.",
        "Gus: Why? What's wrong?",
        "Harley: Uh... I am buried in paperwork here, sweetie. And it's dull, dull, dull.",
        "Gus: Well, what if I said I had the remedy to dull?",
        "Harley: No. No, don't come down here. If you come down here, I'm not going to be able to get any work done. That's for sure.",
        "Gus: Well, maybe that's a good thing.",
        "Harley: Listen to me, just let me get out of here, and I'll meet you back at Company.",
        "Gus: Hey, what's the one thing, what silly little thing that you wish you could have every single day but you don't allow yourself?",
        "Harley: What do I want? Well, you know, that's you, you, you.",
        "Gus: Babe, you can have me every single day, and as much of me as you'd like.",
        "Harley: Well, that doesn't mean I'm going to stop myself from having you all the time.",
        "Gus: Honey, I'm talking about doughnuts here.",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Gus: Doughnuts! Buzz said to himself, \"it's time to make the doughnuts,\" and he made all those fabulous doughnuts. There's a couple of chocolate ones here your name on it.",
        "Harley: Chocolate doughnuts? Great. I'll be right there.",
        "Mallet: Was that a little bedroom talk?",
        "Harley: For my husband and some chocolate doughnuts.",
        "Mallet: Chocolate doughnuts? What are the odds? Ex-husband, chocolate doughnuts. New husband; chocolate doughnuts. I'm no detective but I'm beginning to see a pattern emerge here. No, wait, I am a detective.",
        "Harley: I used to find that charming? Could you keep your patterns to yourself?",
        "Mallet: Some people find that charming. You know what? Maybe it's best that you just go anyway, okay?",
        "Harley: Maybe.",
        "Mallet: I think Marina's going to be fine tonight. I don't think she's going to get into any trouble.",
        "Harley: Probably.",
        "Mallet: I hope not. So I'll just hang out here by myself and do this stakeout by myself.",
        "Harley: That's probably wise. You are the most annoying man I have ever known, truly. But thank you for taking care of Marina.",
        "Mallet: I guess I'm a sucker for a damsel in distress. Harley, sweet dreams.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: All right, what's... what's going on, Josh?",
        "Josh: I'm just trying to keep what's left of my family together.",
        "Jeffrey: I appreciate that. But you think that we aren't allowing Tammy to make her own decisions. Well, isn't that exactly what you and Reva do with Cassie all the time, wanting to hold her hand every time she's in trouble?",
        "Josh: And the probably with that would be what, exactly?",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie can count on me. She can lean on me.",
        "Josh: Of course.",
        "Sandy: Hey, where's Tammy? Is everything all right? What happened?",
        "Cassie: She's gone. With him. You monster!",
        "Josh: Cassie! ( Voices echoing )",
        "Cassie: Reva, I don't care how much you love your rapist son, he's not...",
        "Tammy: Stop it! I love him.",
        "Jonathan: She loves me. There's not a damn thing you can do about it.",
        "Sandy: Tammy, he's using you.",
        "Cassie: This is not love. Tammy: You don't...",
        "Jonathan: That's it!",
        "Cassie: Tammy! Don't go!",
        "Tammy: I love you.",
        "Cassie: Don't ever bother coming back. Tammy! Baby! Tammy!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Are you sure that you want to be here, Tammy? I mean, we don't have to hide anymore. We could go get a nice room someplace.",
        "Tammy: We are someplace, our place. I feel safe here with you.",
        "Jonathan: With me?",
        "Tammy: It sounds crazy, but every place else right now seems scary to me. I broke my mother's heart tonight.",
        "Jonathan: I mean, Reva's going to take care of her, Tammy. And Cassie, she'll come around. Or she won't, but...",
        "Tammy: Does that scare you? Being up against everybody?",
        "Jonathan: I guess I'm kind of used to it.",
        "Tammy: I'm not. Right now I don't have anyone but you, and I don't know if I can...",
        "Jonathan: Shh. Hey, as long as I get to be with you, bring it on, whatever you want-- family, friends, the world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: ( Sighs ) god, I can't let my father disturb our lives again.",

        "Gus: Hi. Hi. You're freezing.",
        "Harley: Who, me?",
        "Gus: What, have you got the air conditioning on in the car? It's December.",
        "Harley: You're the one who's standing out here like a fool.",
        "Gus: It's December.",
        "Harley: Come on. Let's go.",
        "Gus: I was waiting for you. Aren't you hungry? You've been working all night.",
        "Harley: Yeah, I'm starving.",
        "Gus: What have you got right here?",
        "Harley: Huh? What?",
        "Gus: Chocolate.",
        "Harley: Hmm? Let's go home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: We're all out of doughnuts.",
        "Buzz: Thanks, but I'm trying to slim down.",
        "Mallet: Oh, hey.",
        "Buzz: I saw you parked there, and I put one and one together and got the explanation that I expected.",
        "Mallet: Uh, you did?",
        "Buzz: Yeah, you're hanging around my little girl like you're a shadow.",
        "Mallet: Uh, Harley's been talking to you?",
        "Buzz: Not Harley. Marina. She's on surveillance around this neighborhood, and I was worried until I saw your car.",
        "Mallet: Oh, well, you can be rest assured. Nothing's going down tonight, Buzz.",
        "Buzz: Thank you for backing up my granddaughter.",
        "Mallet: You're welcome. Maybe we'll keep it to ourselves.",
        "Buzz: If I told her, she'd drop you like a hot potato. She'd know you were babysitting tonight. I'm glad you're here. I'm just sorry you had to freeze your butt off for nothing.",
        "Mallet: Well, the... the night wasn't a total waste.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: You let Tammy leave with Jonathan.",
        "Josh: Back off, Sandy.",
        "Sandy: Then again, with Reva taking Jonathon's side, he has a free pass to do whatever the hell he wants.",
        "Reva: Sandy, I didn't pick sides.",
        "Cassie: Don't blame Reva for any of this. I don't know what I would do without her, or Josh.",
        "Josh: It's time for us to go.",
        "Cassie: Reva, you'll stay a while, won't you?",
        "Reva: Of course I will.",
        "Cassie: Oh, that might be R.J. He's been having those bad dreams.",
        "Jeffrey: I'll check him.",
        "Cassie: Please stay.",
        "Josh: Let's go, Sandy.",
        "Sandy: I just want you to know that I'm not giving up on Tammy. She may not know it now, but when she comes to her senses, I will be there for her.",
        "Cassie: What am I going to do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Well, little Petey here doesn't quite measure up to the big, beautiful tree at the farm, but...",
        "Tammy: He's ours. I love it.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. You...",
        "Tammy: Me what?",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) I... I always knew that you were beautiful and kind and perfect, but tonight you're brave.",
        "Tammy: You gave me the courage.",
        "Jonathan: Well, that's funny, because that's exactly what you give me. I know it's a little early, but Merry Christmas, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: Merry Christmas, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Come here. I'm sorry, Peter. I love you dearly. Oh, God. ( Laughs )",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Jeffrey: Look, whatever happens between her and Jonathan, she's obviously made her choice. She doesn't want to be with you.",
        "Cassie: How could she think what she's feeling is love? We have to stop them.",
        "Reva: It's not what either one of us wanted, but we now we just have to find a way to deal with it.",
        "Alexandra: Stand back there. Let me look at you. What is it? Something's different.",
        "Quinn: Well, well, things must have gone really well with your guy, huh?",
        "Lizzie: Quinn, hi.",
        "Quinn: Hi. And just think, it's all thanks to me."
